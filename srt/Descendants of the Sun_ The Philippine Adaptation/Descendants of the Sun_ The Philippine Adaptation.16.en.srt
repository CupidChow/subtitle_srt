1
00:00:11,144 --> 00:00:14,147
<i>There's no reason to detain Manalo.</i>

2
00:00:16,883 --> 00:00:18,018
They better be ready.

3
00:00:18,084 --> 00:00:20,020
What we did to Fayad
is just the beginning.

4
00:00:20,086 --> 00:00:21,921
I'm not yet done yet
with those Special Forces.

5
00:00:21,988 --> 00:00:23,656
-What's going on?
-This is really for you.

6
00:00:23,723 --> 00:00:25,325
Maxine, Captain.

7
00:00:25,458 --> 00:00:26,926
Just kidding. I didn't set this up.

8
00:00:26,993 --> 00:00:30,363
Alif has my vote.
He's the son of a prince. He is royalty.

9
00:00:34,968 --> 00:00:37,137
-Captain Manalo is also rich.
-Really, sir?

10
00:00:37,203 --> 00:00:38,738
He is rich in courage.

11
00:00:38,805 --> 00:00:41,041
Fine, he's perfect.
He's the son of a prince.

12
00:00:41,274 --> 00:00:42,776
-Are you jealous?
-Yes.

13
00:00:42,842 --> 00:00:47,213
Captain Manalo saved Fayad,
so he owes his life to Big Boss.

14
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:53,586
You're not like Big Boss.

15
00:00:53,653 --> 00:00:56,222
He can afford to make a few mistakes
because he has leverage.

16
00:00:56,289 --> 00:00:59,192
Remember, Ramos.
You're not like your Big Boss.

17
00:00:59,259 --> 00:01:00,994
You always belittle yourself.

18
00:01:01,127 --> 00:01:04,731
We are soldiers. We should be objective
when we make assessments,

19
00:01:04,798 --> 00:01:07,567
<i>not only of ourselves</i>
<i>but also of our relationships.</i>

20
00:01:15,809 --> 00:01:17,177
-What is up with you!
-Ouch.

21
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:18,812
You're so annoying.

22
00:01:19,612 --> 00:01:21,014
What did you ask for?

23
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:22,949
You asked the person
to leave and asked for this?

24
00:01:23,016 --> 00:01:24,451
This is all you asked for?

25
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:28,154
He said we can ask for anything.

26
00:01:29,956 --> 00:01:34,828
Why didn't you ask
for a trip to Brunei or Maldives?

27
00:01:35,428 --> 00:01:36,663
You're unbelievable.

28
00:01:36,729 --> 00:01:39,299
So, you want us to go to Maldives?

29
00:01:41,434 --> 00:01:44,003
That's not what I mean.
What I mean is you wasted your card.

30
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:45,138
You wasted your card!

31
00:01:45,205 --> 00:01:48,975
It won't go to waste if it means
I can spend time alone with you.

32
00:02:35,522 --> 00:02:36,589
Well, this isn't bad.

33
00:02:38,091 --> 00:02:40,960
At least I can taste this, thanks to you.

34
00:02:44,631 --> 00:02:45,732
You know I really need this,

35
00:02:45,798 --> 00:02:48,768
after all the stress
I've experienced here in the camp.

36
00:02:52,872 --> 00:02:54,374
Want some? Let's taste it?

37
00:02:57,243 --> 00:02:58,478
Don't worry.

38
00:03:00,547 --> 00:03:01,681
I won't report you.

39
00:03:01,748 --> 00:03:03,016
I have a corkscrew here.

40
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:06,452
You know what they say?

41
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:08,988
What? That alcohol works
like a love potion?

42
00:03:09,756 --> 00:03:10,590
You're corny.

43
00:03:11,624 --> 00:03:13,226
I have no plans of seducing you.

44
00:03:15,228 --> 00:03:17,263
No. That's already outdated.

45
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:19,065
-There's something new.
-What?

46
00:03:19,132 --> 00:03:20,133
If there's wine…

47
00:03:23,403 --> 00:03:25,038
-Is that so?
-Yes.

48
00:03:30,677 --> 00:03:32,779
Why are you still hitting on me?

49
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:40,553
Aren't you in a love triangle
with Moira and Diego?

50
00:03:44,857 --> 00:03:48,294
Why are you so interested in that?

51
00:03:48,361 --> 00:03:49,929
-I'm not.
-Oh, come on.

52
00:03:50,396 --> 00:03:52,599
I just find it weird.

53
00:03:53,266 --> 00:03:58,538
This is the first time I hear someone
that she's in a love triangle.

54
00:03:59,706 --> 00:04:00,573
What's up with that?

55
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,343
All right. Fine.

56
00:04:04,611 --> 00:04:08,848
Okay, I'll tell you how it all started.

57
00:04:13,286 --> 00:04:15,121
-What are you doing?
-There's a guy coming.

58
00:04:15,188 --> 00:04:16,889
Tell him that I'm your girlfriend.

59
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:19,892
-He's almost here.
-What for?

60
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:21,661
I don't like him.

61
00:04:21,728 --> 00:04:24,664
He's a guy my dad is setting me up with.
I find him cheeky.

62
00:04:25,064 --> 00:04:26,165
Moira.

63
00:04:27,834 --> 00:04:28,868
I'm her boyfriend.

64
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:32,972
So how long have you been together?

65
00:04:33,039 --> 00:04:34,207
-Eight months.
-Three years.

66
00:04:36,242 --> 00:04:37,777
Okay, practice some more.

67
00:04:42,181 --> 00:04:43,316
You didn't brief me.

68
00:04:45,652 --> 00:04:48,721
So that's the reason
people say we are in a love triangle.

69
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:52,191
But the truth is,
we're not really in a love triangle

70
00:04:52,659 --> 00:04:54,594
because I was the matchmaker.

71
00:04:55,862 --> 00:04:56,696
See?

72
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:58,798
I think Moira is right.

73
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:01,901
You are cheeky, and wisecracking.

74
00:05:02,568 --> 00:05:03,770
What's wrong with that?

75
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:06,673
What's important is I can be
serious about other things

76
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:08,308
and people,

77
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:13,980
especially those
who should be taken seriously.

78
00:05:15,348 --> 00:05:19,218
Don't be too grumpy. Just smile.

79
00:05:20,286 --> 00:05:21,521
Let's enjoy the moment.

80
00:05:21,954 --> 00:05:25,491
At least our date pushed through, right?

81
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:28,828
A date? In the camp?

82
00:05:30,096 --> 00:05:33,866
Well, at least here,
you can't just suddenly leave.

83
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:41,474
It wasn't easy for me to leave you behind.

84
00:05:44,544 --> 00:05:47,246
It wasn't easy for me to leave

85
00:05:48,081 --> 00:05:49,582
because every time I do that,

86
00:05:52,118 --> 00:05:53,319
it gives me a hard time.

87
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:04,030
I didn't want to go out anymore
after our failed dates.

88
00:06:04,997 --> 00:06:08,234
I've lost interest in going out.

89
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:12,672
Even in the hospital,

90
00:06:15,308 --> 00:06:16,642
I kept thinking about you.

91
00:06:17,543 --> 00:06:21,347
I came here to Urdan
hoping to forget things.

92
00:06:27,153 --> 00:06:29,255
I'm sorry if you've been sad
because of me.

93
00:06:34,293 --> 00:06:36,562
Of course, I don't want that
to happen to you.

94
00:06:37,997 --> 00:06:39,999
I don't want that to happen
to the person I love.

95
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:45,004
-Are you really that straightforward?
-Am I making you uncomfortable?

96
00:06:46,272 --> 00:06:49,208
I don't want to beat around the bush.
It's a waste of time.

97
00:06:51,811 --> 00:06:54,747
If you love someone,
you don't let moments pass.

98
00:06:56,182 --> 00:06:57,350
You tell them how you feel.

99
00:07:16,469 --> 00:07:18,438
<i>Our little act was a success.</i>

100
00:07:18,504 --> 00:07:20,807
Lucas is not interested in me anymore.

101
00:07:23,843 --> 00:07:27,580
Does that mean
we have to end this already?

102
00:07:28,514 --> 00:07:29,715
Are you in a rush?

103
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:34,821
I didn't know you dislike me that much.

104
00:07:36,656 --> 00:07:39,592
Starting today,
I won't come near you anymore.

105
00:07:42,862 --> 00:07:45,298
Moira, wait.

106
00:07:46,332 --> 00:07:47,233
What's the matter?

107
00:07:49,435 --> 00:07:50,369
I'm not in a rush.

108
00:07:51,938 --> 00:07:52,839
The truth is…

109
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:56,609
I don't want us to stop.

110
00:07:58,411 --> 00:07:59,645
Moira, I love you.

111
00:08:01,447 --> 00:08:02,815
I have loved you for a long time.

112
00:08:03,282 --> 00:08:05,418
I know we can never be together…

113
00:09:35,007 --> 00:09:36,208
So, it's true.

114
00:09:43,649 --> 00:09:44,717
Moira and you are together.

115
00:09:46,619 --> 00:09:48,421
I owe you a lot, sir.

116
00:09:50,723 --> 00:09:53,092
So, I don't want to take advantage
of your kindness.

117
00:09:55,394 --> 00:09:56,996
But I love Moira so much

118
00:09:58,564 --> 00:10:01,801
and I promise that
I'll always take care of your daughter,

119
00:10:03,369 --> 00:10:06,072
in the same way you took care
of me when I needed help.

120
00:10:06,138 --> 00:10:09,909
If you really love my daughter,
you'll do what's best for her.

121
00:10:09,976 --> 00:10:11,110
Leave her.

122
00:10:11,177 --> 00:10:13,412
I have big dreams for Moira.

123
00:10:13,813 --> 00:10:16,349
You can't help her achieve those dreams.

124
00:10:18,818 --> 00:10:20,987
You're a good person, I know.

125
00:10:24,991 --> 00:10:28,995
But that's not good enough
to make you worthy of my daughter.

126
00:10:55,521 --> 00:10:58,924
We need to head back to the camp,
Captain Moira.

127
00:11:06,265 --> 00:11:08,034
What's happening to us, Diego?

128
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:15,041
It was all an act, right?

129
00:11:16,542 --> 00:11:17,777
We were just pretending.

130
00:11:22,214 --> 00:11:25,017
Why did we have to make it real
if you're just going to leave me?

131
00:11:25,551 --> 00:11:28,020
Diego, answer me.

132
00:11:28,954 --> 00:11:30,623
Diego, speak up!

133
00:11:31,323 --> 00:11:33,826
Come on, speak up!

134
00:11:33,926 --> 00:11:36,062
Diego, answer me.

135
00:11:36,128 --> 00:11:39,198
Answer me please.

136
00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:41,801
Diego…

137
00:11:43,769 --> 00:11:45,171
Diego…

138
00:12:07,359 --> 00:12:10,196
You're the bravest woman I've met.

139
00:12:12,798 --> 00:12:14,433
You shouldn't be crying because of me.

140
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:18,270
You will only get hurt.

141
00:12:21,107 --> 00:12:22,174
Moira, just leave me.

142
00:12:25,044 --> 00:12:26,145
Stay away from me.

143
00:12:30,049 --> 00:12:31,016
Forget about me.

144
00:12:42,294 --> 00:12:43,863
If that's what you really want…

145
00:12:47,299 --> 00:12:48,134
all right, fine!

146
00:12:51,971 --> 00:12:53,072
I will start now.

147
00:13:33,445 --> 00:13:35,347
Don't keep things to yourself.

148
00:13:36,749 --> 00:13:37,716
Share it.

149
00:13:43,255 --> 00:13:47,560
Well, I just thought of Moira and Diego.

150
00:13:48,961 --> 00:13:50,196
They look good together.

151
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:52,898
I pity them.

152
00:13:53,899 --> 00:13:56,068
See, they're both soldiers

153
00:13:56,635 --> 00:14:00,472
so, I think they understand
each other better.

154
00:14:01,273 --> 00:14:02,408
So, you're saying…

155
00:14:04,443 --> 00:14:06,745
a soldier is a suitable match
for another soldier,

156
00:14:06,812 --> 00:14:10,216
but a soldier is not
a suitable match for a doctor?

157
00:14:11,283 --> 00:14:13,419
Well, we're really different.

158
00:14:14,987 --> 00:14:17,623
We took an oath

159
00:14:18,424 --> 00:14:22,027
to save lives
and treat each life as important.

160
00:14:22,628 --> 00:14:24,697
We also give importance to life.

161
00:14:26,098 --> 00:14:27,533
The life of the majority.

162
00:14:28,767 --> 00:14:33,105
We may have different paths,
but we have the same destination.

163
00:14:34,673 --> 00:14:37,877
Maybe it's best that we let things be,

164
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:41,647
and take different paths.

165
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:43,716
You probably got turned-off.

166
00:14:46,518 --> 00:14:51,824
Your first few days here
probably shocked you.

167
00:14:52,491 --> 00:14:53,759
A lot of things happened.

168
00:14:53,826 --> 00:14:56,428
You realized that this is not
the life you wanted.

169
00:14:56,495 --> 00:14:57,496
How about you?

170
00:14:58,998 --> 00:15:00,232
Is this the life that you want?

171
00:15:01,934 --> 00:15:03,002
I never doubted it.

172
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:06,772
I am sure of what I want.

173
00:15:09,008 --> 00:15:10,075
Until now.

174
00:15:12,111 --> 00:15:13,379
Now, I wish…

175
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:19,318
I wish I was good at Math.

176
00:15:21,487 --> 00:15:24,023
You'd get bored if you were an accountant.

177
00:15:25,024 --> 00:15:26,492
It does not fit your personality.

178
00:15:27,459 --> 00:15:28,827
Do you prefer me this way?

179
00:15:31,497 --> 00:15:32,631
It's already late.

180
00:15:33,799 --> 00:15:35,768
I still have a patient in the Medicube.

181
00:15:37,236 --> 00:15:38,070
Okay.

182
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:11,770
I'm all right.

183
00:16:12,371 --> 00:16:13,205
Thank you.

184
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,221
Sir, Diego is back.

185
00:16:40,899 --> 00:16:43,068
Where is Technical Sergeant Ramos?

186
00:17:00,786 --> 00:17:03,322
-Snoopy?
-<i>Hello, sir. Where are you?</i>

187
00:17:03,389 --> 00:17:04,690
<i>We'll pick you up.</i>

188
00:17:04,757 --> 00:17:05,724
I'm fine.

189
00:17:07,226 --> 00:17:08,727
Take charge of things over there.

190
00:17:50,135 --> 00:17:51,870
Why did it suddenly start raining?

191
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:05,117
I'll join you for a walk.

192
00:18:05,184 --> 00:18:06,118
Let's walk around.

193
00:18:19,298 --> 00:18:20,132
Moira?

194
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:22,501
I left Diego on the road.

195
00:18:24,236 --> 00:18:25,070
On the road?

196
00:18:27,539 --> 00:18:29,508
We we'll look for him.

197
00:18:29,575 --> 00:18:31,710
-Come with me.
-Am I your escort?

198
00:18:33,712 --> 00:18:36,148
Diego is wounded. He needs a doctor.

199
00:18:36,215 --> 00:18:37,616
-Come with me.
-What?

200
00:18:40,586 --> 00:18:42,087
What happened? What is it?

201
00:18:42,154 --> 00:18:43,989
Nothing. My buddy and I
will take care of it.

202
00:18:44,056 --> 00:18:45,157
What do you mean 'buddy'?

203
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:50,362
A partner…

204
00:18:51,196 --> 00:18:52,131
Just come with me.

205
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,935
-Diego!
-Wolf!

206
00:19:30,903 --> 00:19:32,171
Wolf, get in the car.

207
00:19:32,237 --> 00:19:34,106
-Diego, come on!
-Come on, get in the car!

208
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:35,941
It's raining hard. Get in the car.

209
00:20:51,216 --> 00:20:52,050
Diego?

210
00:20:53,585 --> 00:20:54,653
What happened, Lucas?

211
00:20:55,887 --> 00:20:57,155
Diego?

212
00:20:57,222 --> 00:21:00,626
He has a high-grade fever.
We need to take him to the emergency room.

213
00:21:14,673 --> 00:21:17,542
He needs antibiotics
to treat the infection.

214
00:21:18,744 --> 00:21:23,382
I don't understand why he didn't come
to the Medicube for treatment.

215
00:21:29,655 --> 00:21:31,023
He doesn't want me to know.

216
00:21:31,223 --> 00:21:35,961
He doesn't want me to worry,
and care for him.

217
00:21:36,028 --> 00:21:38,430
He wants me to stay away from him.

218
00:21:50,542 --> 00:21:51,943
You can leave him with them.

219
00:21:52,644 --> 00:21:53,478
You should rest.

220
00:21:53,545 --> 00:21:54,813
I won't leave.

221
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,548
I'll watch over Diego.

222
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:23,408
Being in the same profession does not
guarantee a smooth-sailing relationship.

223
00:22:24,576 --> 00:22:26,878
You know, they will eventually
patch things up.

224
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:30,148
It looks like Moira is very much
in love with Diego.

225
00:23:00,812 --> 00:23:02,214
I have loved you for a long time.

226
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:07,052
I know we can never be together…

227
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:07,953
I love you, too.

228
00:23:45,023 --> 00:23:47,492
You are the bravest woman I've met.

229
00:23:50,495 --> 00:23:52,397
You shouldn't be crying because of me.

230
00:23:55,133 --> 00:23:56,701
You will only get hurt.

231
00:23:59,538 --> 00:24:00,672
Moira, just leave me.

232
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:42,581
You and Moira had your internship
in the same hospital, right?

233
00:24:42,647 --> 00:24:43,482
Yes.

234
00:24:43,548 --> 00:24:45,684
You never thought of becoming soldier?

235
00:24:46,685 --> 00:24:47,819
-Me?
-Yes.

236
00:24:47,886 --> 00:24:49,354
-A soldier?
-Yes.

237
00:24:50,155 --> 00:24:54,192
First of all, I don't trust soldiers
of what happened to my brother.

238
00:24:54,259 --> 00:24:59,998
Second, I panic at the sound of thunder.
How can I be a soldier?

239
00:25:01,132 --> 00:25:05,670
I was just thinking if it suits you.

240
00:25:05,737 --> 00:25:11,243
If you were a soldier,
it will be for us to be together because…

241
00:25:11,309 --> 00:25:12,410
Don't force it.

242
00:25:12,477 --> 00:25:14,846
I'm fine with us being buddies.

243
00:25:14,913 --> 00:25:16,848
Friends, right?

244
00:25:21,319 --> 00:25:22,153
Anyway…

245
00:25:23,588 --> 00:25:25,056
I'm going to drink this wine…

246
00:25:52,918 --> 00:25:54,986
Yes, I'm jealous.

247
00:25:58,189 --> 00:26:01,960
So please, stay away from him.

248
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:22,948
He said we can ask for anything.

249
00:26:24,215 --> 00:26:28,219
Why didn't you ask
for a trip to Brunei or Maldives?

250
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:31,222
So, you want us to go to Maldives?

251
00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:34,225
That's not what I mean.
What I mean is you wasted your card.

252
00:26:34,292 --> 00:26:37,862
It won't go to waste if it means
I can spend time alone with you.

253
00:27:02,988 --> 00:27:03,989
It's still hot.

254
00:27:04,489 --> 00:27:05,323
It's too salty.

255
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:07,258
Marty, make it good,

256
00:27:07,325 --> 00:27:09,361
so Technical Sergeant Ramos
will recover soon.

257
00:27:09,427 --> 00:27:11,563
Of course. It has a lot of tofu.

258
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:13,932
He'll get better
because it has a lot of protein.

259
00:27:14,065 --> 00:27:15,634
But it's too salty. Tastes like the sea.

260
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:17,869
Prepare some food
for Captain Moira as well.

261
00:27:17,969 --> 00:27:19,404
She watched over him the whole night.

262
00:27:19,471 --> 00:27:22,507
-Hey! That's sweet. Romantic.
-Shut it, bro.

263
00:27:23,041 --> 00:27:25,276
Where is Captain Lucas?

264
00:27:31,816 --> 00:27:33,284
Did he go outside?

265
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:35,654
I'll just look for him.

266
00:27:35,854 --> 00:27:38,323
He's not here.
He was summoned to the base.

267
00:27:40,291 --> 00:27:41,159
Why?

268
00:27:53,872 --> 00:27:57,275
You think your problems are over
because you became close with Fayad?

269
00:27:57,942 --> 00:27:59,577
You think you will not be punished?

270
00:28:36,581 --> 00:28:38,550
Because of you, I disobeyed direct orders.

271
00:28:38,616 --> 00:28:40,351
I sacrificed my career because of you.

272
00:28:40,418 --> 00:28:41,553
-Did you?
-Just for you!

273
00:28:41,619 --> 00:28:42,954
Yes, for you. Isn't it clear?

274
00:28:43,021 --> 00:28:47,192
It was a person's life at stake
against that order you disobeyed.

275
00:28:47,258 --> 00:28:48,526
He's almost done taking a bath.

276
00:28:48,593 --> 00:28:51,196
<i>I'm following your orders,</i>

277
00:28:51,663 --> 00:28:53,465
<i>even if it's difficult to make</i>
<i>Master Ramos take his medicine.</i>

278
00:28:53,531 --> 00:28:54,766
Just try to understand him.

279
00:28:55,233 --> 00:28:57,235
Sir! Ma'am, abort mission.

280
00:28:57,302 --> 00:29:00,105
-You mean, failed mission?
-Seems like he's already well.

281
00:29:00,872 --> 00:29:02,974
We're being ambushed.
I repeat. We're being ambushed.

282
00:29:03,041 --> 00:29:04,042
Copy.

283
00:29:05,543 --> 00:29:07,112
Just have a drink.

284
00:29:07,178 --> 00:29:09,013
It's prohibited.
We're in the camp. I'm on duty.

285
00:29:09,948 --> 00:29:11,149
But I can make an exception.
