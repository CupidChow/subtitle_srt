1
00:00:11,277 --> 00:00:15,582
<i>Won't Capt. Lucas's</i> <i>foot get swollen?</i>
<i>He fell hard.</i>

2
00:00:15,648 --> 00:00:17,350
<i>I'm sure he sprained his foot.</i>

3
00:00:17,417 --> 00:00:19,319
I'm sorry. It's my fault.

4
00:00:19,386 --> 00:00:22,722
<i>You pissed me off,</i>
<i>so I destroyed your boots.</i>

5
00:00:22,789 --> 00:00:25,358
I'm sorry too. I didn't tell you
outright that I'm a soldier.

6
00:00:25,425 --> 00:00:28,762
<i>I have a ticket to return to Manila.</i>
<i>I'm leaving tomorrow afternoon.</i>

7
00:00:28,828 --> 00:00:30,430
Why weren't you with Doc Maxine?

8
00:00:30,497 --> 00:00:31,331
Why, what happened?

9
00:00:31,398 --> 00:00:34,267
Doc Maxine is leaving.
She's going back to Manila.

10
00:00:34,334 --> 00:00:36,936
Lucas, I realized
that I'm needed here more.

11
00:00:37,003 --> 00:00:38,171
Welcome back to Urdan.

12
00:00:39,139 --> 00:00:41,174
Big Boss, the explosion
is just near the camp.

13
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:57,657
<i>Captain Lucas said</i>
<i>you were caught in the crossfire.</i>

14
00:00:57,724 --> 00:01:01,027
I ran so I could catch you here.

15
00:01:01,094 --> 00:01:03,329
Don't worry. I'm not leaving anymore.

16
00:01:03,396 --> 00:01:04,731
-Really?
-Yes.

17
00:01:04,798 --> 00:01:08,568
<i>Promise. Doc Beauty is not leaving</i>
<i>anymore.</i>

18
00:01:14,107 --> 00:01:16,976
-Sirs, let's eat.
-Thank you, ma'am.

19
00:01:17,043 --> 00:01:21,948
-Here's some more.
-Let's eat.

20
00:01:22,015 --> 00:01:24,384
-We have more food inside.
-Doc Maxine.

21
00:01:24,451 --> 00:01:25,618
Lucas.

22
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:28,354
This is for you.

23
00:01:28,421 --> 00:01:30,090
-For me?
-Try it. I cooked that.

24
00:01:30,156 --> 00:01:31,391
-Really?
-Yes.

25
00:01:32,125 --> 00:01:33,993
Wow. I'll taste it.

26
00:01:35,361 --> 00:01:37,197
So I can give my judgment.

27
00:01:53,079 --> 00:01:54,013
It's all right.

28
00:01:55,515 --> 00:01:56,483
Just all right?

29
00:01:56,549 --> 00:01:58,618
It's all right for you to get married.

30
00:01:58,685 --> 00:02:00,353
This is really delicious!

31
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:03,857
-You are full of nonsense.
-I'm telling the truth. This tastes great.

32
00:02:07,727 --> 00:02:09,796
Home cooking is really something else.

33
00:02:11,364 --> 00:02:12,298
Thank you.

34
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:14,634
It's my brother's favorite.

35
00:02:14,701 --> 00:02:15,902
-It is?
-Yes.

36
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:19,172
Wherever your brother is right now…

37
00:02:20,907 --> 00:02:23,042
I'm sure he is very proud of you.

38
00:02:24,677 --> 00:02:25,712
You know why?

39
00:02:27,013 --> 00:02:29,149
Aside from being a doctor,

40
00:02:29,782 --> 00:02:32,819
his sister is also is very kind.

41
00:02:32,886 --> 00:02:35,054
-And she cooks really well.
-Come on.

42
00:02:35,121 --> 00:02:37,757
Right? And she also loves her country.

43
00:02:38,525 --> 00:02:41,694
And most of all,
his sister is very beautiful.

44
00:02:44,397 --> 00:02:46,966
-You really are a sweet talker.
-Why? But it's true.

45
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:51,037
You are also a good listener.

46
00:02:51,104 --> 00:02:52,572
Thank you.

47
00:02:53,339 --> 00:02:55,642
You're still listening
even if I tend to repeat myself.

48
00:02:55,708 --> 00:02:59,012
I'm like a broken record,
but you don't get tired of me.

49
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:01,681
Seriously, thank you.

50
00:03:03,483 --> 00:03:04,551
Thank you for coming back.

51
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,121
I thought…

52
00:03:09,822 --> 00:03:11,691
I'd lose you in my life again.

53
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:18,531
I came back
because it's my calling to help people.

54
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:21,568
It's also my duty as a doctor.

55
00:03:23,403 --> 00:03:28,141
So, whoever needs help,
I'm just here for them.

56
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:29,409
That's where I will be.

57
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:32,212
I'll be with you.

58
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:37,217
Of course, as a soldier,
it's my duty to protect everybody.

59
00:03:38,117 --> 00:03:39,586
To protect you.

60
00:03:41,588 --> 00:03:43,790
So I'll be with you wherever you go.

61
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:47,460
-Really?
-Yes.

62
00:03:48,094 --> 00:03:49,295
What did you put in here?

63
00:04:46,252 --> 00:04:49,122
Master Ramos, you have a package delivery.

64
00:06:21,347 --> 00:06:24,984
It's really a good morning to be with you,
Captain Moira Defensor.

65
00:06:36,095 --> 00:06:38,531
Okay, men,
we're done with the .45 caliber.

66
00:06:48,441 --> 00:06:50,910
Whoever gets the fastest time…

67
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:56,349
Captain Moira and I will verify it first.

68
00:06:57,216 --> 00:07:00,686
Captain, there's a delicious <i>hopia</i>
in the canteen.

69
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:02,288
So, let's have a race?

70
00:07:02,355 --> 00:07:05,024
The loser will treat the winner.

71
00:07:29,849 --> 00:07:32,251
Make sure the <i>hopia</i> comes with some soda.

72
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:52,505
I know that you and my daughter
are in a relationship.

73
00:07:52,572 --> 00:07:56,676
We're not violating any military code
by being in a relationship, sir.

74
00:07:56,742 --> 00:08:00,780
I know that, but I don't want
my daughter to end up with you.

75
00:08:20,466 --> 00:08:21,567
You will obey my order.

76
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:24,570
Leave my daughter.

77
00:08:25,471 --> 00:08:28,207
Aside from being in a lower rank
than your daughter's…

78
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:35,515
do you have other reasons
you don't want us to end up together…

79
00:08:36,816 --> 00:08:37,650
sir?

80
00:08:44,624 --> 00:08:47,593
Just obey my command.

81
00:09:59,699 --> 00:10:03,469
We'll finally see each other again,
Technical Sergeant Diego Ramos.

82
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:45,311
-Ma'am, we're here.
-Thank you.

83
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:10,469
There's signal in the camp.
Why do you need to go to internet shop?

84
00:11:10,536 --> 00:11:14,674
I need to send files, photos, and videos.

85
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:16,876
I need to update my report
to the hospital.

86
00:11:16,942 --> 00:11:19,278
I need a strong Wi-Fi.

87
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:20,312
Okay.

88
00:11:25,885 --> 00:11:27,853
Your shop is awesome. It's three-in-one.

89
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:31,123
We provide fast and convenient service.

90
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:35,828
While your car is being repaired,
you can surf the net while having coffee.

91
00:11:36,629 --> 00:11:37,930
He has a point.

92
00:11:48,074 --> 00:11:51,010
Hey. You still need to use
the internet, right?

93
00:11:52,011 --> 00:11:53,279
Your patient is waiting.

94
00:11:53,345 --> 00:11:54,747
-Yes.
-Right?

95
00:11:54,814 --> 00:11:55,915
-Let's go.
-Okay.

96
00:11:55,981 --> 00:11:56,849
This way, please.

97
00:12:12,131 --> 00:12:13,566
Is everything okay?

98
00:12:14,366 --> 00:12:15,835
Yes. It's fine.

99
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:46,332
You might want to try our new coffee.

100
00:12:46,899 --> 00:12:48,367
We use native beans.

101
00:12:49,802 --> 00:12:50,970
Really?

102
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:55,908
Sure. Do you have samples
or free taste test?

103
00:12:56,642 --> 00:12:59,979
You should buy some, sir. It's very cheap.
It's one hundred pesos per cup.

104
00:13:00,045 --> 00:13:01,046
One hundred?

105
00:13:05,518 --> 00:13:07,453
If you want, we also have rice meals.

106
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:11,357
I know being a soldier can be tiring,
so you are always hungry.

107
00:13:11,423 --> 00:13:14,026
-Very hungry!
-Right?

108
00:13:14,093 --> 00:13:16,295
-We have chicken breast.
-I'm almost done.

109
00:13:16,362 --> 00:13:17,429
-Really?
-Yes.

110
00:13:17,496 --> 00:13:18,731
I'm almost done.

111
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:21,200
-It goes well with the coffee, sir.
-Yes.

112
00:13:21,267 --> 00:13:23,102
We can just eat and have coffee
at the camp.

113
00:13:23,169 --> 00:13:25,604
Not here. It's expensive here.

114
00:13:27,506 --> 00:13:29,475
-I'm done. Don't buy anymore.
-Thanks anyway, sir.

115
00:13:30,509 --> 00:13:31,610
Let's go.

116
00:13:31,677 --> 00:13:33,579
-I'll have it as takeaway, please.
-Sure.

117
00:13:36,115 --> 00:13:37,216
-Let's go.
-Okay.

118
00:13:37,283 --> 00:13:39,185
I'll just wait for my takeaway.

119
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:42,054
-You want some rice?
-No, thanks.

120
00:13:42,121 --> 00:13:43,289
No?

121
00:13:43,355 --> 00:13:44,857
Follow up on our order, please.

122
00:13:56,468 --> 00:13:57,403
Diego?

123
00:14:15,254 --> 00:14:19,191
Base, tell Marty to come over.

124
00:14:20,392 --> 00:14:21,861
Tell him I'll wait for him.

125
00:14:26,165 --> 00:14:28,234
The soldier's on his way.
to take you to the barracks.

126
00:14:31,804 --> 00:14:35,207
Do I need to be in an accident again
so you can face me properly?

127
00:14:45,851 --> 00:14:47,353
Be careful while you're here.

128
00:14:48,487 --> 00:14:49,822
The land is not flat.

129
00:14:50,656 --> 00:14:54,493
And make sure
you always wear your uniform,

130
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,262
so the mosquitoes won't bite you.

131
00:14:57,096 --> 00:14:59,098
You're so confusing, Diego.

132
00:15:00,165 --> 00:15:02,501
Are you not happy that I'm here too?

133
00:15:08,774 --> 00:15:10,109
Why are you standing there?

134
00:15:12,311 --> 00:15:13,579
Sir? Ma'am.

135
00:15:18,651 --> 00:15:20,886
Go ahead and take her to the barracks.

136
00:15:22,788 --> 00:15:23,722
Yes, sir.

137
00:15:30,362 --> 00:15:31,397
This way, ma'am.

138
00:15:54,887 --> 00:15:55,888
Why did we stop?

139
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:01,894
What are you planning?

140
00:16:05,898 --> 00:16:06,932
Let's go.

141
00:16:12,438 --> 00:16:13,305
Hey!

142
00:16:16,709 --> 00:16:17,943
What is he planning?

143
00:17:15,234 --> 00:17:16,668
It's beautiful here.

144
00:17:17,836 --> 00:17:19,805
It seems like we're in a different world.

145
00:17:21,507 --> 00:17:23,575
Is this your first time here?

146
00:17:23,642 --> 00:17:24,576
Yes.

147
00:17:25,778 --> 00:17:27,346
I'm happy because I'm with you.

148
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:07,052
They have a saying here...

149
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:12,458
that if you take a pebble from this beach,
you will definitely return.

150
00:18:26,472 --> 00:18:28,307
If that day comes that we come back here…

151
00:18:29,641 --> 00:18:30,909
I hope…

152
00:18:32,511 --> 00:18:33,912
I hope we are already a couple.

153
00:18:45,657 --> 00:18:47,559
I wonder how this ship got here?

154
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:56,969
It's here because
it has grown to love this place.

155
00:19:07,713 --> 00:19:09,047
Just like me.

156
00:19:13,352 --> 00:19:15,120
I have grown to love you too.

157
00:20:10,475 --> 00:20:11,577
Maxine?

158
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:16,815
They might be looking for us at the camp.

159
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:31,597
Sorry, I thought…

160
00:20:31,663 --> 00:20:32,598
You thought what?

161
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:36,435
I thought we were good.

162
00:20:36,501 --> 00:20:39,338
You got jealous of the waitress earlier.

163
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:42,307
-Me? Jealous?
-Weren't you?

164
00:20:43,675 --> 00:20:45,244
You really are presumptuous.

165
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:49,014
I should've let you
have coffee in the shop

166
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:50,616
so you'd get nervous even just a bit.

167
00:20:53,218 --> 00:20:54,686
Sorry, I didn't…

168
00:21:01,526 --> 00:21:03,328
Maxine, wait. Maxine.

169
00:21:06,031 --> 00:21:07,232
Are you still mad at me?

170
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,936
Haven't you forgiven me yet?

171
00:21:11,003 --> 00:21:13,839
Is this still because of your anger
towards soldiers?

172
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:23,115
That's sad, Lucas.

173
00:21:26,418 --> 00:21:32,190
But that doesn't mean I will go
with whoever professes love for me.

174
00:21:36,895 --> 00:21:40,799
But it's sadder to be in a relationship…

175
00:21:42,467 --> 00:21:44,536
where you are always left alone.

176
00:21:46,872 --> 00:21:50,942
You can say that I'm clingy or needy.

177
00:21:53,011 --> 00:21:55,847
But if I get into a relationship…

178
00:21:57,983 --> 00:21:59,951
I want it to be with someone
I can always be with.

179
00:22:01,953 --> 00:22:03,221
I understand.

180
00:22:06,091 --> 00:22:12,631
I won't lie to you and say
that day won't come,

181
00:22:12,698 --> 00:22:14,966
that I won't leave you,
because I'm a soldier.

182
00:22:16,735 --> 00:22:19,504
We both know that won't happen.

183
00:22:21,707 --> 00:22:22,874
But I understand you.

184
00:22:37,222 --> 00:22:39,591
How I wish you were just an accountant.

185
00:24:16,621 --> 00:24:20,592
Try carrying thirty sacks of rice.
Let's see if you get tired too.

186
00:24:20,659 --> 00:24:23,261
I'm just letting her vent out
all her anger towards me.

187
00:24:23,328 --> 00:24:26,865
When she's done,
her feelings might fade as well.

188
00:24:26,932 --> 00:24:28,500
Don't you have feelings for her anymore?

189
00:24:28,567 --> 00:24:31,937
You will execute your plans
when half of our troops have evacuated?

190
00:24:32,003 --> 00:24:34,172
-We don't have enough people.
-There's only a few left.

191
00:24:34,239 --> 00:24:35,507
<i>We can handle them.</i>

192
00:24:43,482 --> 00:24:46,184
We already have a visual on Alif Fayad.
We're ready to move.

193
00:24:46,251 --> 00:24:47,819
<i>This will be a huge ransom.</i>

194
00:24:47,886 --> 00:24:49,354
It's an ambush!
