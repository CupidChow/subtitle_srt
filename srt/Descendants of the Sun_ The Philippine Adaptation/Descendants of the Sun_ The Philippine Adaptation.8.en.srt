1
00:00:11,144 --> 00:00:13,413
Help! There's a boy drowning!

2
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:16,182
<i>What if he decides to show up again?</i>

3
00:00:16,249 --> 00:00:18,618
He'll get nothing because he won't see me.

4
00:00:18,685 --> 00:00:21,321
<i>I've just decided</i>
<i>to do volunteer work in Urdan.</i>

5
00:00:21,388 --> 00:00:22,956
This war has just become personal.

6
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:23,990
Not now.

7
00:00:24,057 --> 00:00:26,292
I thought you'd lie low
for our future child?

8
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:29,629
Good thing you're here.
Thanks for saving our son.

9
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:32,599
The PRG will no longer bother us.

10
00:00:32,665 --> 00:00:34,567
The PRG comes here?

11
00:00:34,634 --> 00:00:36,603
I really hope all this will end soon

12
00:00:36,669 --> 00:00:38,405
so we can start a new life,

13
00:00:38,471 --> 00:00:40,273
and you can be reunited with your sister.

14
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:42,175
It's a small world, indeed.

15
00:00:42,242 --> 00:00:43,610
Dr. Maxine Dela Cruz.

16
00:00:43,676 --> 00:00:45,378
You'll be seeing each other again.

17
00:00:45,445 --> 00:00:46,613
<i>What's your plan now?</i>

18
00:00:46,679 --> 00:00:49,049
<i>It's just work, nothing personal.</i>

19
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:51,785
<i>I'm in charge of your safety here.</i>

20
00:00:51,851 --> 00:00:53,253
<i>I'm Captain Lucas Manalo.</i>

21
00:00:53,319 --> 00:00:54,687
<i>I believe this is yours.</i>

22
00:01:22,182 --> 00:01:23,416
This is the Medicube.

23
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:26,953
There's no hospital in the area

24
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:30,156
so we created a makeshift hospital
here in Urdan.

25
00:01:30,223 --> 00:01:32,358
And it has just become operational again.

26
00:01:32,425 --> 00:01:35,061
It's been a while
since there were doctors and nurses here.

27
00:01:35,862 --> 00:01:38,465
Urdan is a remote area
and the roads are not passable.

28
00:01:38,531 --> 00:01:40,667
The delivery of supplies here are limited.

29
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:45,905
We're all here
to give assistance to the community.

30
00:01:46,539 --> 00:01:48,641
Your presence here is a really big help.

31
00:01:48,708 --> 00:01:52,645
The people of Urdan
are grateful to you already.

32
00:01:59,385 --> 00:02:01,488
Welcome and thank you for being here.

33
00:02:01,588 --> 00:02:04,090
Thank you!<i> </i>It's beautiful.

34
00:02:04,891 --> 00:02:05,892
This is beautiful.

35
00:02:35,121 --> 00:02:36,389
Hello, excuse me.

36
00:02:36,456 --> 00:02:38,291
Have some water.
I'm sure you are all thirsty.

37
00:02:38,958 --> 00:02:40,160
Thank you so much.

38
00:02:46,332 --> 00:02:48,101
Have we met before?

39
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:49,335
You look familiar.

40
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:52,305
Yes, I think we've met him before.

41
00:02:52,805 --> 00:02:53,673
You're right.

42
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:56,843
He's the…

43
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:58,044
You were the snatcher?

44
00:02:58,111 --> 00:02:59,112
Wait, "snatcher"?

45
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:05,084
Marty Talledo at your service.

46
00:03:05,518 --> 00:03:06,786
Who would have thought?

47
00:03:09,422 --> 00:03:11,457
You're cuter with your new look.

48
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:12,525
Hey!

49
00:03:14,794 --> 00:03:16,496
Thank you.

50
00:03:16,996 --> 00:03:18,464
Can you jump in place?

51
00:03:19,132 --> 00:03:20,033
Wait. Why?

52
00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:21,601
So we can see if your foot is okay.

53
00:03:21,668 --> 00:03:24,237
I'll just see if you've healed already
and can jump.

54
00:03:24,304 --> 00:03:26,005
-You had a fracture, right?
-Okay.

55
00:03:29,008 --> 00:03:30,076
Look at him go.

56
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:33,112
-He's doing fine.
-I agree.

57
00:03:33,179 --> 00:03:34,681
He's fully recovered from the fracture.

58
00:03:35,615 --> 00:03:36,916
Is the water still cold?

59
00:03:36,983 --> 00:03:37,984
-Yes.
-Still okay?

60
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:39,352
Yes, thank you.

61
00:04:01,307 --> 00:04:03,343
<i>You didn't get to talk to Dr. Maxine?</i>

62
00:04:04,978 --> 00:04:08,748
The medical mission starts tomorrow.
There's no need to talk to her yet.

63
00:04:09,449 --> 00:04:10,450
No need?

64
00:04:11,684 --> 00:04:12,919
Are you sure about that?

65
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:21,628
I'm here to lead this military camp
and to help the people in Urdan.

66
00:04:50,923 --> 00:04:52,392
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

67
00:04:56,529 --> 00:04:58,631
-This place is nice.
-Absolutely!

68
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,302
-It's beautiful.
-Yes.

69
00:05:03,036 --> 00:05:05,271
-Even if it's ruined.
-Has it always looked like this?

70
00:05:05,338 --> 00:05:06,506
It's beautiful, right?

71
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:17,083
Doc, you can have the other cabinet.
We can share in the smaller one.

72
00:05:17,617 --> 00:05:20,720
Yes, Doc. We only have a few things.

73
00:05:21,721 --> 00:05:22,722
No need.

74
00:05:22,789 --> 00:05:25,325
You can use that cabinet because…

75
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:27,894
I might return to Manila.

76
00:05:30,096 --> 00:05:31,097
What?

77
00:05:33,433 --> 00:05:34,500
Why, Doc?

78
00:05:40,106 --> 00:05:41,541
I've changed my mind.

79
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:46,512
Doc, I don't mean to pry, but…

80
00:05:46,579 --> 00:05:48,514
Is it because of Captain Lucas?

81
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:50,950
Is he the one you were seeing before?

82
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:51,851
Yes.

83
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:53,519
That's him.

84
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:57,890
Such bad luck
that we meet again, and here.

85
00:05:59,992 --> 00:06:02,161
Is that the reason
why you're going back to Manila?

86
00:06:02,228 --> 00:06:03,763
Yes.

87
00:06:04,497 --> 00:06:06,432
I don't want to be seeing his face,

88
00:06:06,499 --> 00:06:08,601
and it's not healthy for us
to be here together.

89
00:06:09,168 --> 00:06:11,104
I'll probably die from stress.

90
00:06:11,704 --> 00:06:13,673
But what a pity,
since you're here already.

91
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:17,610
She's right, Doc. And it must be destiny.

92
00:06:17,677 --> 00:06:18,544
Oh, god.

93
00:06:18,611 --> 00:06:21,781
Don't worry,
I'll request for a replacement.

94
00:06:21,848 --> 00:06:23,182
I'll call the hospital.

95
00:06:25,918 --> 00:06:27,987
I'll just step out to book my flight.

96
00:06:29,555 --> 00:06:31,290
-Doc, it's late already.
-I won't take long.

97
00:06:31,357 --> 00:06:32,358
I'll come back soon.

98
00:06:32,425 --> 00:06:34,327
It's too dark outside!

99
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,001
Maxine.

100
00:06:47,206 --> 00:06:49,142
Where are you going?
It's 8:00 p.m already.

101
00:06:50,109 --> 00:06:51,277
The gate's closed already.

102
00:06:51,811 --> 00:06:53,212
You can't go out anymore.

103
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:56,315
It's none of your business.

104
00:06:58,251 --> 00:06:59,218
Actually, it is.

105
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:09,061
And of course, that includes you too.

106
00:07:12,031 --> 00:07:14,400
Don't worry.
I'll be leaving first thing tomorrow.

107
00:07:14,467 --> 00:07:16,936
You won't see me again.
I'm going back to Manila.

108
00:07:17,837 --> 00:07:18,671
Really?

109
00:07:20,807 --> 00:07:21,941
Okay, it's up to you.

110
00:07:22,842 --> 00:07:23,876
Really it is!

111
00:07:26,179 --> 00:07:28,014
But there's only
one flight per week, right?

112
00:07:29,048 --> 00:07:30,483
I've mentioned that to you, remember?

113
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:31,984
-Is that so?
-Yes.

114
00:07:32,051 --> 00:07:33,019
You can't scare me.

115
00:07:33,085 --> 00:07:36,122
Whatever happens,
I'll be leaving tomorrow, liar.

116
00:07:37,023 --> 00:07:39,659
Here we go again.
It's up to you if you want to leave.

117
00:07:39,725 --> 00:07:41,527
Let's see
if you can catch a flight to Manila.

118
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:47,533
Hey, wrong way.

119
00:07:50,102 --> 00:07:51,070
The other way.

120
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:53,072
-Which is it?
-To your left.

121
00:07:55,508 --> 00:07:57,076
Please excuse me…

122
00:07:58,211 --> 00:07:59,412
Please excuse me…

123
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:23,903
Is there a flight going to Manila?

124
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:26,506
I have to fly back.
There's an emergency at home.

125
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:30,977
Where is the ticketing office?

126
00:08:31,043 --> 00:08:32,945
There's a ticketing office inside,

127
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:34,914
but there's only one flight per week
to Manila.

128
00:08:34,981 --> 00:08:36,682
We only have limited flights as of now.

129
00:08:40,753 --> 00:08:42,021
I see, thank you.

130
00:08:42,088 --> 00:08:44,056
-Okay.
-Thank you.

131
00:08:50,396 --> 00:08:51,731
Let's go.

132
00:08:51,831 --> 00:08:55,968
Let's return to the Medicube.
We probably already have patients waiting.

133
00:08:56,602 --> 00:08:58,004
Okay, Doc. Let's go.

134
00:08:58,704 --> 00:08:59,972
Let me take your luggage.

135
00:09:02,074 --> 00:09:04,377
So do you believe now
that there's only one flight per week?

136
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:11,517
Good thing there are no flights
back to Manila, Dr. Maxine.

137
00:09:12,084 --> 00:09:13,953
We can't handle this without you.

138
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,122
I'm really sorry.

139
00:09:16,689 --> 00:09:20,092
You know me.
I'm not an irresponsible person.

140
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,461
It's just not healthy for me to stay here.

141
00:09:22,528 --> 00:09:23,963
You don't have to apologize.

142
00:09:25,131 --> 00:09:27,967
We understand you
and your personal concerns.

143
00:09:28,034 --> 00:09:29,835
What's important is that you're here now.

144
00:09:31,337 --> 00:09:32,438
Excuse me.

145
00:09:33,639 --> 00:09:34,707
Dr. Maxine.

146
00:09:34,774 --> 00:09:35,775
Hello.

147
00:09:38,344 --> 00:09:39,879
What's your name?

148
00:09:39,946 --> 00:09:42,348
I'm Dr. Maxine. How about you?

149
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:43,716
I'm Biboy.

150
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:46,485
What is Biboy's problem?

151
00:09:46,552 --> 00:09:49,655
Doctor, I just want
to have my son checked.

152
00:09:49,722 --> 00:09:52,024
I'm Sheila, Biboy's mother.

153
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:54,894
He has seizures and his body gets stiff.

154
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:58,631
He even collapses sometimes.

155
00:09:58,698 --> 00:10:00,032
When did this start?

156
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,035
When he was still a young boy.

157
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:06,205
An herbalist said…

158
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:08,741
he's being punished by a spirit.

159
00:10:08,808 --> 00:10:12,244
I don't think Biboy
is being punished by a spirit.

160
00:10:12,878 --> 00:10:16,849
His seizures and loss of consciousness
could be caused by epilepsy.

161
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:19,752
-Epi…
-Epilepsy.

162
00:10:19,819 --> 00:10:20,753
It's epilepsy.

163
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:23,522
If you can come back tomorrow,

164
00:10:23,589 --> 00:10:28,661
we can check and make sure
it is indeed epilepsy.

165
00:10:28,728 --> 00:10:31,464
But, Doc, we don't have money to pay.

166
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:33,366
Don't worry about it.

167
00:10:33,432 --> 00:10:35,568
You don't have to pay in Medicube.

168
00:10:36,836 --> 00:10:41,173
You're not only kind, Dr. Maxine,
you're also very pretty.

169
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:42,642
Beautiful.

170
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:44,610
-Oh, gosh!
-You are beautiful.

171
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:46,912
Thank you. I think we'll get along well.

172
00:10:47,513 --> 00:10:48,881
Thank you, Doc.

173
00:10:50,216 --> 00:10:51,450
I'll see you tomorrow.

174
00:11:01,594 --> 00:11:03,429
Hold on, okay?

175
00:11:05,631 --> 00:11:06,465
Does it hurt?

176
00:11:07,466 --> 00:11:08,300
How about this?

177
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:18,070
<i>I missed you, Maxine.</i>

178
00:13:20,766 --> 00:13:24,236
Thank you, Dr. Maxine.
We'll just come back tomorrow.

179
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:25,471
Of course!

180
00:13:25,538 --> 00:13:27,907
Bye, Doc Max Beautiful.

181
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:32,578
Doctor, you are heaven sent to us.

182
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:35,848
But I have a request, if you may.

183
00:13:35,915 --> 00:13:37,183
What is it?

184
00:13:37,249 --> 00:13:41,220
I have a lot of neighbors who are sick.

185
00:13:42,054 --> 00:13:43,055
Maybe…

186
00:13:43,589 --> 00:13:45,724
you can help them, too.

187
00:13:45,791 --> 00:13:47,226
Sure.

188
00:13:47,293 --> 00:13:49,161
Is your place far from here?

189
00:13:50,763 --> 00:13:54,099
It's just two hours away on foot.

190
00:13:54,633 --> 00:13:57,069
You just have to cross five rivers.

191
00:13:57,636 --> 00:13:58,637
Five…

192
00:14:00,306 --> 00:14:02,474
Sure, we can go there now.

193
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:05,144
Thank you so much, Dr. Maxine.

194
00:14:05,211 --> 00:14:06,545
Just give me a second.

195
00:14:09,081 --> 00:14:10,082
Emma.

196
00:14:10,649 --> 00:14:12,718
I'll go with them to Sitio Santos.

197
00:14:12,785 --> 00:14:13,819
I'll be back soon.

198
00:14:13,886 --> 00:14:14,887
Where is that?

199
00:14:15,654 --> 00:14:17,756
-Want me to come with you?
-No need, I can manage.

200
00:14:17,823 --> 00:14:18,924
I'll be back right away.

201
00:14:18,991 --> 00:14:20,192
-Let's go.
-Come on.

202
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:32,538
Hello, neighbors.

203
00:14:34,974 --> 00:14:37,409
This is Dr. Maxine.

204
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:41,347
She's a doctor from the hospital.

205
00:14:41,914 --> 00:14:42,882
Good afternoon.

206
00:14:43,849 --> 00:14:48,687
Mrs. Sheila mentioned to me
that many of you are sick.

207
00:14:48,754 --> 00:14:52,758
I'm here to check on your health.

208
00:14:53,692 --> 00:14:54,660
Everybody fall in line.

209
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:57,263
Okay. There's a table!

210
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:01,867
All right, please fall in line.

211
00:15:03,502 --> 00:15:04,503
Oh, my God.

212
00:15:05,771 --> 00:15:06,772
All right.

213
00:15:08,707 --> 00:15:09,875
Just fall in line.

214
00:15:13,045 --> 00:15:16,148
We may start the check-up.
I'll look at you first.

215
00:15:16,215 --> 00:15:17,249
Come here.

216
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:25,624
What's going on there?

217
00:15:25,691 --> 00:15:28,394
It's a medical mission.
A lot of people here are sick.

218
00:16:17,076 --> 00:16:21,013
Dr. Maxine, thank you so much.

219
00:16:22,715 --> 00:16:28,220
It's a blessing to us
that there's a doctor like you…

220
00:16:28,921 --> 00:16:30,456
who is concerned about us.

221
00:16:32,024 --> 00:16:34,660
You're not only a good doctor,
you are kind, too.

222
00:16:34,727 --> 00:16:36,095
Oh, gosh.

223
00:16:36,161 --> 00:16:38,530
Don't mention it, it's our duty.

224
00:16:43,469 --> 00:16:45,437
Aren't we lost?

225
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:47,306
Did we pass here earlier?

226
00:16:47,373 --> 00:16:50,409
Oh, we're not. This is a short cut.

227
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:55,681
It would be dangerous to be here by dark.

228
00:17:31,016 --> 00:17:31,884
Mrs. Sheila?

229
00:17:32,584 --> 00:17:33,852
Mrs. Sheila?

230
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:39,658
Mrs. Sheila?

231
00:18:00,779 --> 00:18:02,347
<i>The subscriber cannot be reached.</i>

232
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:03,682
Nothing, it's not going through.

233
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:09,655
Captain Lucas.

234
00:18:09,721 --> 00:18:12,191
Dr. Maxine hasn't returned yet.

235
00:18:13,158 --> 00:18:14,326
Why? Where did she go?

236
00:18:14,893 --> 00:18:17,329
She went with a patient earlier.

237
00:18:18,497 --> 00:18:21,266
I was supposed to go with her
but we were busy.

238
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:22,734
She said she'd be back soon.

239
00:18:23,669 --> 00:18:26,071
Did you call her yet? What did she say?

240
00:18:26,138 --> 00:18:27,673
We can't contact her.

241
00:18:28,407 --> 00:18:29,641
The call is not going through.

242
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:32,644
She went out of the camp?

243
00:18:33,278 --> 00:18:35,147
You know that's dangerous, right?

244
00:18:36,248 --> 00:18:38,117
You can get kidnapped
if you go out of the camp.

245
00:18:38,183 --> 00:18:39,451
I hope not.

246
00:18:39,518 --> 00:18:41,820
Oh, my God.
I hope nothing bad happens to Dr. Maxine.

247
00:18:41,887 --> 00:18:44,790
I hope so. You are all my responsibility.
You shouldn't be--

248
00:18:44,857 --> 00:18:46,125
Unbelievable.

249
00:18:46,191 --> 00:18:47,759
Did she mention where she was going?

250
00:18:47,826 --> 00:18:50,195
I heard earlier it's Sitio…

251
00:18:50,729 --> 00:18:52,197
-Where?
-Sitio Santos.

252
00:18:52,264 --> 00:18:54,700
-Yes, it's Sitio Santos.
-Piccolo, come in.

253
00:18:54,766 --> 00:18:57,503
We have to look for Dr. Maxine.
She's missing.

254
00:18:58,036 --> 00:18:59,938
Get her files, including her picture.

255
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:01,940
Yes, right away.

256
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:16,989
Maxine…

257
00:19:18,223 --> 00:19:19,358
Maxine, think.

258
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:27,132
You're not lost, okay?

259
00:19:28,634 --> 00:19:30,869
You just need to find the biggest river…

260
00:19:31,937 --> 00:19:34,039
then go to the end of it.

261
00:19:35,274 --> 00:19:38,477
Until you see people and houses.

262
00:20:02,234 --> 00:20:03,402
Go ahead and try.

263
00:20:17,349 --> 00:20:19,117
Let's ask them.

264
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:26,058
Good day.

265
00:20:29,494 --> 00:20:31,196
Have you seen her?

266
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:34,366
She checked on some patients earlier.

267
00:20:34,433 --> 00:20:36,602
I just passed by here. I didn't see her.

268
00:20:37,703 --> 00:20:38,637
Do you recognize her?

269
00:20:39,771 --> 00:20:41,540
Oh, yes, Dr. Maxine.

270
00:20:41,607 --> 00:20:44,509
She left already with Sheila.

271
00:20:44,977 --> 00:20:45,911
Mrs. Sheila…

272
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:49,848
Thank you.

273
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:53,218
Mrs. Sheila.

274
00:20:53,952 --> 00:20:56,321
Mrs. Sheila, someone is looking for you.

275
00:20:57,889 --> 00:20:59,024
Captain Lucas!

276
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:00,626
-Mrs. Sheila!
-Captain Lucas!

277
00:21:01,493 --> 00:21:03,395
I need your help.

278
00:21:03,462 --> 00:21:06,965
I've been looking in the forest
for Doc Maxine.

279
00:21:07,466 --> 00:21:09,501
I can't find her.

280
00:21:09,568 --> 00:21:10,902
You go this way, I'll go that way.

281
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:21,280
Where are you, Mrs. Sheila?

282
00:21:27,252 --> 00:21:29,855
I'm Dr. Maxine.

283
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:32,924
Can you help me?

284
00:21:32,991 --> 00:21:37,195
Which way is it to Urdan?
I'm kind of lost.

285
00:21:37,996 --> 00:21:38,897
What did she say?

286
00:21:39,564 --> 00:21:40,732
I don't understand her.

287
00:21:41,933 --> 00:21:46,772
The way going to Urdan.

288
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:49,408
-Urdan.
-Maxine!

289
00:21:53,345 --> 00:21:54,846
Hey, wait!

290
00:21:57,115 --> 00:21:59,918
What are you doing here?
This place is dangerous.

291
00:22:00,452 --> 00:22:03,088
Next time you go out of the camp,
inform the staff, okay?

292
00:22:05,724 --> 00:22:07,092
What you did was dangerous.

293
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:10,262
You're putting the camp
and the entire medical mission in danger.

294
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:30,816
I'm coming back here tomorrow.

295
00:22:30,882 --> 00:22:33,318
A lot of people here are sick.
They need help.

296
00:22:33,385 --> 00:22:35,687
You can't. It's dangerous here.

297
00:22:36,488 --> 00:22:39,291
There are reported sightings
of PRG members here.

298
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:41,893
And besides,
a landmine exploded here the other day.

299
00:22:42,961 --> 00:22:46,098
And don't trust just anyone.

300
00:22:46,164 --> 00:22:48,600
We don't know who our allies are
and who are the enemies.

301
00:22:48,667 --> 00:22:49,835
Trust?

302
00:22:58,977 --> 00:23:00,212
What do you mean?

303
00:23:00,278 --> 00:23:02,414
I just know the word "trust."

304
00:23:02,481 --> 00:23:05,417
I had that before,
but you made a fool out of me.

305
00:23:07,519 --> 00:23:09,788
She is still not over it.

306
00:23:10,655 --> 00:23:11,690
You see me like that?

307
00:23:12,591 --> 00:23:17,462
I lied about my job,
but it doesn't mean I have bad intentions.

308
00:23:18,397 --> 00:23:21,867
Whether your intentions were good or bad,
it changes nothing.

309
00:23:21,933 --> 00:23:23,402
You still lied to me.

310
00:23:23,468 --> 00:23:24,369
Cheater.

311
00:23:24,436 --> 00:23:25,837
A cheater? Really?

312
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:27,105
You are quick to judge.

313
00:23:27,172 --> 00:23:28,907
You don't even know
what I'm going through.

314
00:23:30,609 --> 00:23:32,210
Cheater.

315
00:23:32,277 --> 00:23:34,379
You're going too far.

316
00:23:34,446 --> 00:23:36,748
Why? What? Are you pissed?

317
00:23:36,815 --> 00:23:38,984
If what I'm saying isn't true,
why are you so pissed?

318
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:39,951
Answer me.

319
00:23:42,854 --> 00:23:43,922
I'm not pissed.

320
00:23:46,324 --> 00:23:47,492
Let's go.

321
00:23:47,559 --> 00:23:49,227
They're looking for you at the Medicube.

322
00:24:00,839 --> 00:24:01,840
You go on ahead.

323
00:24:02,474 --> 00:24:03,675
I can handle myself.

324
00:24:03,742 --> 00:24:05,277
And even if you hadn't found me here,

325
00:24:05,343 --> 00:24:07,245
I'd have been able
to find my way back on my own.

326
00:24:07,312 --> 00:24:08,613
I don't need you.

327
00:24:14,085 --> 00:24:15,220
Maxine, don't move.

328
00:24:15,887 --> 00:24:17,222
You stepped on a landmine.

329
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:36,708
What?

330
00:24:36,775 --> 00:24:38,977
-What am I going to do?
-Relax.

331
00:24:39,044 --> 00:24:40,879
-I'll die, Lucas!
-Don't move.

332
00:24:40,946 --> 00:24:42,447
You're panicking. Relax and don't move.

333
00:24:42,514 --> 00:24:45,150
-Don't move your foot.
-Don't leave me! Just stay!

334
00:24:45,217 --> 00:24:47,352
It's all right. Don't move your foot.

335
00:24:48,987 --> 00:24:51,356
Are you okay now? Don't move too much.

336
00:24:52,057 --> 00:24:53,758
I'll step on it instead, okay?

337
00:25:42,507 --> 00:25:45,110
Even if you don't like him,
I still love him.

338
00:25:49,014 --> 00:25:50,115
<i>Does it have to be that big?</i>

339
00:25:50,181 --> 00:25:51,683
<i>-Count.</i>
-I will count?

340
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:54,052
No, them. Of course you!

341
00:25:58,623 --> 00:26:00,058
<i>You both seem to be enjoying it.</i>

342
00:26:00,125 --> 00:26:03,428
Maybe because you always bicker
when you see each other.

343
00:26:03,495 --> 00:26:05,397
Whatever. I'm still mad at him.

344
00:26:05,463 --> 00:26:07,966
I already have a ticket
for Manila tomorrow.

345
00:26:08,033 --> 00:26:09,267
Are you really leaving?

346
00:26:09,334 --> 00:26:12,070
That is our target, Sitio Santo Domingo.

347
00:26:12,137 --> 00:26:14,940
That's the primary base
and the training ground

348
00:26:15,006 --> 00:26:17,475
of the youth recruited by the enemies.

349
00:26:17,542 --> 00:26:20,011
<i>Okay, Alpha Team.</i>
<i>No one will relax while in the area.</i>

350
00:26:20,078 --> 00:26:22,247
<i>This is a hot spot</i>
<i>of terrorist activities.</i>
