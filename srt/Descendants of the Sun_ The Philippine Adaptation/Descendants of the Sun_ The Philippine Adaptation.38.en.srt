1
00:00:11,244 --> 00:00:12,479
Is this what you're looking for?

2
00:00:12,545 --> 00:00:14,547
That's mine!

3
00:00:16,816 --> 00:00:18,184
The police will take care of you.

4
00:00:18,251 --> 00:00:22,989
Manager Ed is now under police custody.
They will get the information we need.

5
00:00:23,056 --> 00:00:24,891
We have nothing to worry about for now.

6
00:00:25,892 --> 00:00:27,427
You are really reliable.

7
00:00:27,494 --> 00:00:28,461
What's that for?

8
00:00:28,528 --> 00:00:30,196
This is for the movement.

9
00:00:31,931 --> 00:00:34,701
We will rise again even if Bullet is gone.

10
00:00:34,768 --> 00:00:35,635
<i>I know this already.</i>

11
00:00:35,702 --> 00:00:37,737
We'll always say goodbye to each other

12
00:00:37,804 --> 00:00:42,075
until the day comes
when you will no longer return.

13
00:00:42,142 --> 00:00:44,911
If you can be brave for other people,

14
00:00:44,978 --> 00:00:46,913
why can't you be brave for yourself?

15
00:00:47,947 --> 00:00:51,684
Is it really final?
There's no hope for you and Doc Maxine?

16
00:00:51,751 --> 00:00:56,523
I don't know how I can convince her
to give whatever we have a chance.

17
00:00:56,589 --> 00:00:57,457
Whatever that is.

18
00:00:57,524 --> 00:00:59,359
She didn't tell you anything, right?

19
00:00:59,426 --> 00:01:01,728
It's you who admitted
your feelings for her?

20
00:01:01,795 --> 00:01:03,963
Fine, you're the happy couple.

21
00:01:04,964 --> 00:01:07,167
-It's fixed now?
-Yes.

22
00:01:07,233 --> 00:01:08,935
Can I play some music?

23
00:01:09,002 --> 00:01:12,305
It can give the atmosphere
in the camp a real lift.

24
00:01:35,061 --> 00:01:35,995
Are you okay?

25
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:38,665
Ma'am, are you doing okay?

26
00:01:52,312 --> 00:01:53,480
Hey.

27
00:01:55,315 --> 00:01:56,449
That's a nice song.

28
00:01:57,183 --> 00:02:00,687
Doc Maxine played that
to make her feel better.

29
00:02:01,488 --> 00:02:03,523
I think she has a problem.

30
00:02:06,192 --> 00:02:07,460
She opened up to you?

31
00:02:08,595 --> 00:02:10,196
Well, that's all she said.

32
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:12,899
Captain Lucas, you know how women are.

33
00:02:13,533 --> 00:02:14,868
They are mysterious and secretive.

34
00:02:14,934 --> 00:02:17,937
We don't really know
what's going on in their minds.

35
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:39,526
<i>Lucas?</i>

36
00:02:42,328 --> 00:02:45,064
<i>Lucas, you're probably on your way here.</i>

37
00:02:45,932 --> 00:02:48,868
<i>But I'm not sure</i>
<i>if you'll still find me alive.</i>

38
00:02:55,942 --> 00:02:59,913
At least you can find my body in the water
before it decomposes.

39
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:02,015
<i>If I only knew I was going to die,</i>

40
00:03:02,081 --> 00:03:04,851
<i>I would have done</i>
<i>everything I wanted in life.</i>

41
00:03:06,653 --> 00:03:08,955
<i>How I wish I didn't get scared.</i>

42
00:03:09,489 --> 00:03:14,427
That's enough! Turn it off please.

43
00:03:15,895 --> 00:03:19,766
<i>Lucas, I wish I was as brave as you.</i>

44
00:03:21,768 --> 00:03:24,404
<i>I should've told you everything.</i>
<i>The truth.</i>

45
00:03:26,472 --> 00:03:27,941
<i>I like you too, Lucas.</i>

46
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:30,510
<i>I like you, Lucas.</i>

47
00:03:31,778 --> 00:03:32,845
That's enough!

48
00:03:34,847 --> 00:03:37,083
Oh, my God. Why is this happening to me?

49
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:42,855
<i>You know when you kissed me,</i>
<i>my world stopped.</i>

50
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:49,896
<i>I have never felt that in my whole life</i>
<i>and I didn't want it to end.</i>

51
00:04:42,649 --> 00:04:45,285
It seems we already know
what's in the mind

52
00:04:45,351 --> 00:04:46,986
and heart of Doc Maxine.

53
00:04:47,053 --> 00:04:47,954
It looks like it.

54
00:05:02,101 --> 00:05:06,706
Oh, my. This is embarrassing.

55
00:05:13,246 --> 00:05:14,447
Hey, how did you...

56
00:05:16,749 --> 00:05:17,717
I hurried.

57
00:05:17,784 --> 00:05:20,219
Of course,
I wasn't going to miss this chance.

58
00:05:21,087 --> 00:05:22,522
You cheated.

59
00:05:22,588 --> 00:05:24,991
You used your training
in the Special Forces.

60
00:05:25,058 --> 00:05:28,594
-Unfair advantage, Lucas. Unbelievable.
-What do you mean "unfair advantage'?

61
00:05:29,629 --> 00:05:34,000
It's my advantage that I found out.
You've rejected me a lot of times.

62
00:05:34,067 --> 00:05:38,404
If you did not broadcast your feelings,
I wouldn't have known.

63
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:45,011
Why are you listening
to someone else's recording, Lucas?

64
00:05:45,078 --> 00:05:46,913
Me? Listening? Well, it just played.

65
00:05:47,747 --> 00:05:51,150
You could've covered your ears.
You shouldn't have listened to it.

66
00:05:52,418 --> 00:05:56,222
Maxine, you can't hide from me anymore.

67
00:05:56,789 --> 00:05:59,425
Why don't you listen to your own advice?

68
00:05:59,492 --> 00:06:04,764
You said you wished you were brave,
and that you were not scared.

69
00:06:06,265 --> 00:06:08,935
Why did it all come out
when you almost died?

70
00:06:09,001 --> 00:06:12,405
The truth came out
when you are most scared.

71
00:06:12,472 --> 00:06:15,675
But why did things change
after I saved you?

72
00:06:27,653 --> 00:06:28,521
Maxine.

73
00:06:35,962 --> 00:06:37,296
Over there. Look at that.

74
00:06:37,363 --> 00:06:39,732
That won't work on me.

75
00:06:39,799 --> 00:06:43,369
Maxine, stop fighting your feelings.

76
00:06:46,773 --> 00:06:47,907
Let's talk about this.

77
00:06:50,943 --> 00:06:52,378
Okay, fine.

78
00:06:55,481 --> 00:06:56,582
Fine, let's talk.

79
00:06:56,649 --> 00:06:57,850
-Really?
-Yes.

80
00:06:57,917 --> 00:06:59,018
You will not run?

81
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:01,788
-I will not run.
-You will not run?

82
00:07:01,854 --> 00:07:04,891
-Lucas, let me go. Please.
-You really won't run?

83
00:07:04,957 --> 00:07:07,393
I will not run. It's hot in here.
Let me go.

84
00:07:22,875 --> 00:07:24,577
So they've already kissed.

85
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:29,081
-You mean they are already a couple?
-I guess they are.

86
00:07:29,549 --> 00:07:32,218
Wait. What is a good couple name for them?

87
00:07:33,085 --> 00:07:34,287
Luxine?

88
00:07:34,353 --> 00:07:38,424
-That's a good one.
-It suits them.

89
00:07:38,491 --> 00:07:39,926
Are you not jealous, Emma?

90
00:07:40,927 --> 00:07:44,430
Maxine has time for love.
And she has time for...

91
00:07:46,699 --> 00:07:47,600
Are you not jealous?

92
00:07:47,667 --> 00:07:50,903
You know what, guys?
It should not be all work.

93
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:53,806
There should be time for love, too.

94
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:57,143
You heard that? That's right.

95
00:07:57,944 --> 00:07:59,078
Did you hear that?

96
00:07:59,579 --> 00:08:01,614
-Stop it.
-Listen to the doctor's advice.

97
00:08:19,232 --> 00:08:20,366
What now, buddy?

98
00:08:20,433 --> 00:08:23,369
I told you Captain Manalo and Doc Maxine
will eventually become a couple.

99
00:08:23,436 --> 00:08:24,270
So?

100
00:08:25,271 --> 00:08:26,172
All right.

101
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:32,111
But I still don't like Doc Maxine.

102
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:37,917
I don't think she can handle
the life of a soldier.

103
00:08:39,318 --> 00:08:41,721
-Maybe she'll eventually surrender.
-Surrender?

104
00:08:41,787 --> 00:08:43,623
Why would she? Is she a rebel?

105
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:46,125
Buddy, stop making excuses.
Give that to me.

106
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:47,760
You lost.

107
00:08:48,694 --> 00:08:50,530
-Give it to him.
-Give it to me. There you go.

108
00:08:51,998 --> 00:08:52,999
I lost?

109
00:08:56,969 --> 00:08:57,937
You're dead.

110
00:08:58,471 --> 00:09:00,706
You'll treat us for drinks
when we get back to Manila.

111
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:05,912
Why? What is that?

112
00:09:07,013 --> 00:09:09,248
You should get one of these, Marty.

113
00:09:09,315 --> 00:09:13,819
Once you have this,
you will never lose any bet.

114
00:09:17,189 --> 00:09:18,124
Just give that to me.

115
00:09:20,326 --> 00:09:21,694
Just play better next time.

116
00:09:24,263 --> 00:09:26,065
I'm just looking for someone.

117
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:58,864
Have you seen Doc Maxine?

118
00:09:59,565 --> 00:10:01,701
I saw her go inside.

119
00:10:14,513 --> 00:10:15,414
Maxine?

120
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:21,721
Maxine?

121
00:10:24,156 --> 00:10:25,858
Maxine, don't hide from me.

122
00:10:25,925 --> 00:10:27,927
Let's talk, please.

123
00:10:29,395 --> 00:10:30,229
Maxine?

124
00:10:32,231 --> 00:10:34,567
We're acting like kids here.

125
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:39,972
Maxine?

126
00:11:07,033 --> 00:11:07,900
Maxine?

127
00:11:10,603 --> 00:11:11,437
Maxine?

128
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:17,043
Big Boss?

129
00:11:18,577 --> 00:11:20,146
What are you doing there?

130
00:11:22,214 --> 00:11:23,482
I'm just looking for someone.

131
00:11:27,653 --> 00:11:28,821
Is it Doc Maxine?

132
00:11:29,422 --> 00:11:30,656
Did she run away from you?

133
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:37,029
Let's go.

134
00:11:37,096 --> 00:11:38,464
Are you two playing Hide-and-Seek?

135
00:11:39,965 --> 00:11:40,833
Who's winning?

136
00:12:19,338 --> 00:12:21,173
Are you hiding, Doc Maxine?

137
00:12:25,911 --> 00:12:29,515
I'm sorry, but there is nothing else
you can hide from us.

138
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:32,418
We heard your love confession
for Captain Lucas.

139
00:12:32,485 --> 00:12:35,221
It's just a matter of time
before you face each other again.

140
00:12:36,722 --> 00:12:37,556
Isn't it...

141
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:44,697
You and Diego have been together
for quite some time now, right?

142
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:49,969
Yes. We separated for a few months,
but I'm not counting that.

143
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:52,371
I know you are a military doctor,

144
00:12:53,205 --> 00:12:56,742
but Diego's job is something different.

145
00:12:58,210 --> 00:13:00,880
Are you all right having a boyfriend
who is a soldier?

146
00:13:00,946 --> 00:13:06,485
After all, you know better how
dangerous their job is, right?

147
00:13:06,552 --> 00:13:08,654
You mean in the Special Forces?

148
00:13:08,721 --> 00:13:10,256
Even if their team is small,

149
00:13:10,322 --> 00:13:13,092
they are sent to different places
to take out a threat?

150
00:13:14,426 --> 00:13:18,631
Sometimes, you don't know where they are
and when they will return?

151
00:13:20,099 --> 00:13:21,500
I can endure that.

152
00:13:22,034 --> 00:13:25,271
But every time Diego and I are together,
I make the most out of it.

153
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:27,606
And even though he is on a mission,

154
00:13:27,673 --> 00:13:29,942
he knows someone is waiting
for his return.

155
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:35,381
It is more frightening to think
that no one is waiting for him.

156
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:08,781
That's quite strong.

157
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:10,549
Hey.

158
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:13,953
I took a shower. I don't have body odor.

159
00:14:14,486 --> 00:14:15,721
Did I say anything?

160
00:14:19,058 --> 00:14:22,094
Why is Doc Maxine still running away
from you, Big Boss?

161
00:14:22,728 --> 00:14:24,396
You're weak.

162
00:14:24,463 --> 00:14:27,166
Your call sign should be "Weakling"
and not Big Boss.

163
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:31,136
You already know how she feels about you,

164
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:32,504
yet you're still not together?

165
00:14:32,972 --> 00:14:34,039
What a shame.

166
00:14:36,408 --> 00:14:39,511
Well, Maxine is really different.

167
00:14:40,446 --> 00:14:42,047
-She's really different.
-She's different.

168
00:14:42,114 --> 00:14:44,283
She's different
and you're still not a couple.

169
00:14:44,817 --> 00:14:49,955
That's why you like her, right?
Because she's different.

170
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:52,424
Yes.

171
00:14:52,925 --> 00:14:53,959
How about you?

172
00:14:55,294 --> 00:14:57,529
Is it all right for you
that your boyfriend is a soldier?

173
00:14:57,596 --> 00:14:59,431
-Hey.
-Tell me.

174
00:14:59,498 --> 00:15:01,000
Hey, I'm here.

175
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:04,703
You and Maxine asked the same question.

176
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:08,974
She asked you?
What did she ask you about?

177
00:15:10,643 --> 00:15:11,677
What did you say?

178
00:15:15,681 --> 00:15:18,951
Oh, come on.
Seriously, what did she ask you?

179
00:15:19,485 --> 00:15:20,986
What was it about? Was it about me?

180
00:15:21,053 --> 00:15:22,655
I bet it was.

181
00:15:22,721 --> 00:15:27,226
Moira, you should build me up.

182
00:15:27,726 --> 00:15:29,194
Who is your friend?

183
00:15:29,862 --> 00:15:32,264
Well, you two should talk.

184
00:15:32,331 --> 00:15:34,633
We are talking. I already asked her.

185
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:37,202
At least we have a clue.
You should help me.

186
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:40,005
Do not get us involved
because we are happy.

187
00:15:41,006 --> 00:15:42,374
Right?

188
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:44,843
-We're happy.
-Wait.

189
00:15:46,345 --> 00:15:48,414
-Big Boss. I know the secret.
-What is it?

190
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,115
It's just cheap. Let's tell him.

191
00:15:50,749 --> 00:15:51,684
What?

192
00:15:52,151 --> 00:15:53,118
It's a secret.

193
00:15:53,185 --> 00:15:57,489
You two should talk. We're happy.

194
00:16:02,428 --> 00:16:03,362
Great.

195
00:17:52,671 --> 00:17:55,874
You think I don't know
that you did everything to keep me alive.

196
00:17:56,642 --> 00:17:57,609
I knew it.

197
00:17:58,644 --> 00:18:02,114
Do you think I will waste everything
you did just by being careless?

198
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:04,416
Maxine, I'm good at what I do.

199
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:07,920
And it's my responsibility
as a soldier not to die.

200
00:18:08,954 --> 00:18:10,789
You can't predict that.

201
00:18:10,856 --> 00:18:13,725
How will you know if you will not try?

202
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:16,261
Please, don't leave.

203
00:18:17,663 --> 00:18:20,499
Listen to your own advice.

204
00:18:20,566 --> 00:18:26,038
You said, you wished you were brave,
and that you were not scared.

205
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:29,508
Why did it all come out
when you almost died?

206
00:18:29,575 --> 00:18:32,978
The truth came out
when you are most scared.

207
00:18:33,045 --> 00:18:36,515
But why did things change
after I saved you?

208
00:18:47,259 --> 00:18:48,660
<i>I also like you.</i>

209
00:18:49,228 --> 00:18:51,563
<i>I like you, Lucas.</i>

210
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:56,268
<i>When you kissed me, my world stopped.</i>

211
00:18:57,469 --> 00:19:01,039
<i>I have never felt that in my whole life</i>
<i>and I didn't want it to end.</i>

212
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:14,686
Go to sleep, Big Boss.

213
00:19:14,753 --> 00:19:16,889
We need to report to
the base early tomorrow.

214
00:19:57,229 --> 00:19:59,264
-Did I commit a violation?
-No.

215
00:20:00,165 --> 00:20:03,969
I just wanted to thank you
for what you did for Captain Manalo.

216
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:06,104
You went far and above
your duty as a doctor

217
00:20:07,139 --> 00:20:09,474
to make sure our men are safe.

218
00:20:14,513 --> 00:20:17,482
In fact, I can say you'd make
a fine military doctor.

219
00:20:23,956 --> 00:20:25,023
Thank you, sir.

220
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:30,229
Thank you, too.

221
00:20:31,129 --> 00:20:32,164
Thank you.

222
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,395
The diamonds obtained
from the mining manager

223
00:21:03,462 --> 00:21:06,798
disappeared while in police custody.

224
00:21:06,865 --> 00:21:10,769
According to our asset,
it's now in the hands of the PRG.

225
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:15,173
I'm ready.

226
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:19,111
But like I said, I will give the diamonds
only to your boss.

227
00:21:19,811 --> 00:21:23,048
I want to meet him before we push through
with this partnership.

228
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:27,219
My boss is also hesitant.
He knows that your former leader is gone.

229
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:32,457
I can assure you that I can run the PRG
just like how Bullet did before.

230
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:36,895
We just need support
to rebuild the movement.

231
00:21:38,196 --> 00:21:42,067
According to our asset,
the PRG has a new camp.

232
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:44,803
But we don't know the exact location yet.

233
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:50,342
Needless to say, we will not stop
until we find out where they are hiding.

234
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:56,982
Very well, since we are done
discussing military matters,

235
00:21:57,849 --> 00:22:00,185
I want to talk to you
about personal matters.

236
00:22:02,587 --> 00:22:04,289
What we are going to talk about

237
00:22:04,356 --> 00:22:07,459
will not leave the four corners
of this tent.

238
00:22:12,564 --> 00:22:15,801
Captain Manalo, I heard the confession
of Dr. Dela Cruz...

239
00:22:23,041 --> 00:22:25,544
Don't you feel anything for my daughter?

240
00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:27,279
Dad, come on.

241
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:39,691
I admire Captain Defensor

242
00:22:39,758 --> 00:22:44,496
because she's a good doctor
and a good friend.

243
00:22:47,432 --> 00:22:50,669
But that's the only
relationship we have, sir.

244
00:23:15,894 --> 00:23:16,928
Where is Diego and Moira?

245
00:23:17,996 --> 00:23:20,465
The General is still talking to them.

246
00:23:21,133 --> 00:23:22,567
It looks like it will take some time.

247
00:23:22,634 --> 00:23:26,405
I think we should go back to the camp
ahead of them.

248
00:23:27,572 --> 00:23:28,473
Just the two of us?

249
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:32,310
Don't worry. I will not force you
to admit anything to me.

250
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:36,281
I've already heard what I want to hear.
So, that's okay.

251
00:23:36,348 --> 00:23:38,683
Fine, give me the keys.

252
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:42,287
I'll drive so if you tease me,
I can ask you to get out of the car.

253
00:23:57,903 --> 00:24:01,506
Dad, please respect me
and my relationship with Diego.

254
00:24:03,074 --> 00:24:06,445
Diego followed all your orders.
He passed all your tests.

255
00:24:06,511 --> 00:24:08,246
What else does Diego have to do?

256
00:24:14,719 --> 00:24:16,221
Diego is a fine man.

257
00:24:17,923 --> 00:24:20,058
I saw how serious he is about you.

258
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:22,160
He is dedicated to being a soldier.

259
00:24:22,227 --> 00:24:27,466
I also saw how he puts the needs of others
at his own expense.

260
00:24:29,468 --> 00:24:31,970
He proved himself to me.

261
00:24:40,378 --> 00:24:42,981
But whoever holds this...

262
00:24:45,884 --> 00:24:46,818
wins, right?

263
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:24,556
It's okay.

264
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:29,327
Even though it's difficult,
complicated, and scary.

265
00:25:30,262 --> 00:25:32,163
At least I have no regrets.

266
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:34,699
I will not regret that I did not tell you.

267
00:25:34,766 --> 00:25:36,935
<i>The military are confident right now</i>

268
00:25:37,002 --> 00:25:39,371
<i>because they believe that the PRG</i>
<i>decided to lay low.</i>

269
00:25:39,437 --> 00:25:41,006
But they are wrong.

270
00:25:41,072 --> 00:25:43,942
We will strengthen our forces
against them.

271
00:25:47,979 --> 00:25:50,649
<i>You have a package here from Lovely Tan.</i>

272
00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:54,920
"This was my first date
with Captain Lucas.

273
00:25:54,986 --> 00:25:57,222
Please give this to him
so he won't forget."
