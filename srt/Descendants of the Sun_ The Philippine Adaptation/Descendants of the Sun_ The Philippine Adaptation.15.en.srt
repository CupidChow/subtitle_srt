1
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:32,198
-I still have no regrets, sir.
-What did you say?

2
00:00:38,104 --> 00:00:40,940
All the calls I made
were for the safety of Mr. Fayad.

3
00:00:41,007 --> 00:00:42,542
Now, if that's the punishment

4
00:00:42,609 --> 00:00:45,712
for the wrong decisions I made,
I will accept it.

5
00:00:45,779 --> 00:00:47,680
Do you know what could happen to him?

6
00:00:47,747 --> 00:00:49,816
His career will not only be destroyed,

7
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:52,519
he can also go to jail
if Mr. Fayad doesn't wake up.

8
00:00:52,585 --> 00:00:55,321
Why didn't you tell me?

9
00:00:55,388 --> 00:00:57,190
You could've stopped me…

10
00:00:57,257 --> 00:00:58,992
You wouldn't be there now if you had.

11
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:02,462
You're a doctor.
You took an oath to save lives, right?

12
00:01:02,529 --> 00:01:03,997
I just respected that.

13
00:01:06,232 --> 00:01:08,234
It's Alif! He's awake.

14
00:01:09,936 --> 00:01:11,371
We'll become famous.

15
00:01:11,438 --> 00:01:14,207
We are the ones
who saved Alif Fayad's life.

16
00:01:14,274 --> 00:01:16,276
We will be famous, especially you Maxine.

17
00:01:53,513 --> 00:01:55,915
Goodbye.

18
00:01:56,382 --> 00:01:57,650
He learned a Tagalog word.

19
00:01:57,717 --> 00:01:58,685
Goodbye.

20
00:02:01,921 --> 00:02:03,423
-Goodbye!
-Goodbye.

21
00:02:19,539 --> 00:02:23,076
We received a special request
from Alif Fayad's camp.

22
00:02:24,244 --> 00:02:27,313
They want a news blackout
on the attempted kidnapping.

23
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:29,415
Someone might make an attempt
on his life again

24
00:02:29,482 --> 00:02:31,484
if they find out
that his security is weak.

25
00:02:31,551 --> 00:02:34,387
-Yes, sir.
-<i>The whole rescue operation</i>

26
00:02:34,454 --> 00:02:36,723
of the Special Forces
will be confidential.

27
00:02:37,557 --> 00:02:39,993
Even the medical procedure done on him.

28
00:02:40,059 --> 00:02:41,628
Yes, I understand, sir.

29
00:02:41,694 --> 00:02:45,665
As such, there's no reason
to detain Manalo in the camp.

30
00:02:49,569 --> 00:02:50,503
What?

31
00:02:55,708 --> 00:02:57,410
<i>What he did was insubordination.</i>

32
00:02:57,477 --> 00:02:59,345
We can't just let that pass.

33
00:03:27,807 --> 00:03:29,008
-Let's go?
-Let's go.

34
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:51,397
Lucas?

35
00:05:30,897 --> 00:05:32,398
-Big Boss!
-Big Boss!

36
00:05:32,465 --> 00:05:33,800
-Big Boss!
-Welcome back, Big Boss!

37
00:05:33,866 --> 00:05:36,035
-How are you?
-Big Boss! How are you?

38
00:05:36,636 --> 00:05:38,271
-Big Boss, we missed you.
-What's up?

39
00:05:39,939 --> 00:05:40,873
-Big Boss.
-Marty.

40
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:43,409
-How are you?
-I'm still alive.

41
00:05:48,581 --> 00:05:49,549
Maxine.

42
00:05:49,615 --> 00:05:51,617
It's good that they finally let you out.

43
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:53,052
It was fine.

44
00:05:53,986 --> 00:05:55,588
Good thing there were no mosquitoes.

45
00:06:04,964 --> 00:06:05,798
So...

46
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:08,334
is there no welcome feast for me?

47
00:06:08,901 --> 00:06:12,405
-There is. I cooked something for you.
-But no welcome drinks, okay?

48
00:06:12,472 --> 00:06:13,706
Marty, get ready.

49
00:06:13,773 --> 00:06:14,640
Yes, sir.

50
00:06:15,608 --> 00:06:16,509
I'm starving.

51
00:06:16,576 --> 00:06:17,543
Captain?

52
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:19,011
-Let's eat.
-Let's go, boys.

53
00:06:19,078 --> 00:06:20,046
-Maxine.
-Let's go, boys.

54
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:22,181
Time to eat.

55
00:06:24,517 --> 00:06:28,621
<i>Alif Fayad's visit to the town</i>
<i>of Urdan was a success.</i>

56
00:06:28,688 --> 00:06:31,791
<i>But it was reported</i>
<i>that a problem occurred</i>

57
00:06:31,858 --> 00:06:34,460
<i>in the middle of his outreach activity.</i>

58
00:06:34,527 --> 00:06:36,229
<i>But it was said</i>
<i>to have been easily resolved</i>

59
00:06:36,295 --> 00:06:39,232
<i>thanks to the presence</i>
<i>of military forces in the area.</i>

60
00:06:39,298 --> 00:06:41,868
<i>This is the statement</i>
<i>from Alif Fayad himself.</i>

61
00:06:41,934 --> 00:06:44,704
<i>I really want to thank</i>
<i>the Philippine Military Forces</i>

62
00:06:44,771 --> 00:06:46,272
<i>who helped me in Urdan.</i>

63
00:06:46,339 --> 00:06:50,109
<i>I'm really going to miss all the people.</i>
<i>And I hope to see you again.</i>

64
00:06:50,643 --> 00:06:51,744
<i>God willing.</i>

65
00:06:53,646 --> 00:06:55,381
They are good at cover ups!

66
00:06:55,448 --> 00:06:57,950
What if we release our statement
regarding what happened

67
00:06:58,017 --> 00:06:59,252
to humiliate them?

68
00:06:59,318 --> 00:07:01,254
No one will believe us.

69
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:04,590
I'm sure they got rid
of all the records of what happened.

70
00:07:08,361 --> 00:07:09,962
Rodel, what's the matter with you?

71
00:07:10,029 --> 00:07:12,465
The more you force yourself,
the more you will not get well.

72
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:14,434
They'll see.

73
00:07:15,701 --> 00:07:17,804
What we did to Fayad
is just the beginning.

74
00:07:18,805 --> 00:07:20,940
I'm not done
with those Special Forces yet.

75
00:07:35,555 --> 00:07:36,389
Let's go.

76
00:07:36,889 --> 00:07:37,990
Where are we going?

77
00:07:48,201 --> 00:07:49,101
Wait…

78
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:52,572
What is this?

79
00:07:59,178 --> 00:08:00,012
What's going on?

80
00:08:01,247 --> 00:08:02,715
You had this set up?

81
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:04,417
Do you like it?

82
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:07,153
This is really for you.

83
00:08:07,687 --> 00:08:08,621
For me?

84
00:08:10,957 --> 00:08:13,259
What is this? A date?

85
00:08:17,363 --> 00:08:18,397
Why?

86
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:21,100
Don't you like it?

87
00:08:40,453 --> 00:08:43,089
Maxine! Captain.

88
00:08:43,155 --> 00:08:44,090
Mr. Fayad?

89
00:08:46,592 --> 00:08:48,594
I was kidding. I didn't set this up.

90
00:08:49,395 --> 00:08:52,198
Don't worry. It's a group date, right?

91
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:48,921
I'd rather have alcohol.

92
00:09:58,564 --> 00:10:03,402
After everything that we went through,
we really deserve this.

93
00:10:10,343 --> 00:10:12,411
Thanks, Alif! Thank you!

94
00:10:12,478 --> 00:10:13,713
Alif is really special.

95
00:10:14,347 --> 00:10:19,518
He's a man with a heart.
He's so rich and yet so sincere.

96
00:10:19,585 --> 00:10:21,053
Someday I'll be like him.

97
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,155
And then what? You'll get kidnapped too?

98
00:10:23,656 --> 00:10:25,925
Then Captain Lucas
and the team will save you.

99
00:10:26,425 --> 00:10:29,629
Yeah, he's like a real-life superhero.

100
00:10:29,695 --> 00:10:32,665
Say what you want, but Alif has my vote.

101
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:35,601
-What did you say?
-Alif has my vote.

102
00:10:36,202 --> 00:10:38,504
Why, can't I have a "man crush"?

103
00:10:38,571 --> 00:10:40,439
Girls are allowed
to have "girl crushes," right?

104
00:10:40,506 --> 00:10:41,540
You're so unfair.

105
00:10:41,607 --> 00:10:43,042
Wait a minute, Earl.

106
00:10:43,109 --> 00:10:44,310
Who are we voting for?

107
00:10:44,377 --> 00:10:45,277
Who else?

108
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:00,359
No, don't.

109
00:11:02,428 --> 00:11:04,230
Hey! Why not?

110
00:11:05,131 --> 00:11:06,465
It looks delicious.

111
00:11:06,532 --> 00:11:08,000
Are you forgetting where we are?

112
00:11:23,215 --> 00:11:25,718
Hey! You're in a military camp.
Alcohol is not allowed here.

113
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:27,787
Well, that's only applicable to soldiers.

114
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:30,122
-That's not true.
-Don't drag me into it.

115
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:32,558
It applies to everyone.
What if there's a medical emergency?

116
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:57,149
<i>First and foremost,</i>
<i>Alif is the son of a prince.</i>

117
00:11:57,216 --> 00:12:00,052
He is royalty.
That's already one point for him.

118
00:12:01,153 --> 00:12:03,489
Captain Lucas is the son
of a retired general.

119
00:12:03,956 --> 00:12:05,224
They may not be of royal blood,

120
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:07,993
but they offered their blood
and sweat for the country.

121
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:09,662
Wow!

122
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:11,530
That's right.

123
00:12:12,131 --> 00:12:13,399
They each have one point now.

124
00:12:14,033 --> 00:12:17,570
Yes, they're both kind,
handsome, and buffed.

125
00:12:17,636 --> 00:12:19,605
They both have four points.

126
00:12:19,672 --> 00:12:21,774
Alif is well-traveled, cultured.

127
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:25,745
I mean, he's been places, you know?

128
00:12:43,462 --> 00:12:44,530
Gosh.

129
00:13:07,686 --> 00:13:11,023
Captain Manalo
has visited other countries as well.

130
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:14,593
And even if he is on a mission,
he still learns a lot of things.

131
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:16,996
So, they both get a point, right?

132
00:13:22,001 --> 00:13:23,169
Why?

133
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:27,339
You look prettier if you smile.

134
00:13:28,741 --> 00:13:31,310
-Where did that come from?
-Hey, I'm just being honest!

135
00:13:31,377 --> 00:13:34,847
Wait, my bet needs to take the lead.

136
00:13:34,914 --> 00:13:38,417
Alif is not just kind and good looking.

137
00:13:39,051 --> 00:13:41,187
His net worth is in the billions.

138
00:13:41,253 --> 00:13:44,924
He's so rich that you won't have to worry
about anything if he's your boyfriend.

139
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:46,759
Captain Manalo is also rich.

140
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:48,527
Really, sir?

141
00:13:50,029 --> 00:13:51,530
Yes, he's rich in courage.

142
00:13:51,597 --> 00:13:53,999
-Yeah! That's it!
-That never runs out.

143
00:13:54,066 --> 00:13:54,934
Yes.

144
00:13:55,534 --> 00:13:56,769
And that's what matters.

145
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:58,871
And whatever you say,

146
00:13:59,538 --> 00:14:02,608
Captain Manalo saved Fayad from the PRG.

147
00:14:03,776 --> 00:14:06,278
So, he owes his life to Big Boss.

148
00:14:06,779 --> 00:14:08,447
-That's true.
-End of discussion.

149
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:10,449
-That's right.
-Alpha Team?

150
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:17,756
That's a billion points for Captain Lucas!

151
00:14:17,823 --> 00:14:19,458
-Yes!
-Cheers for Capt. Lucas.

152
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:22,761
-Yeah, that's right!
-Guys, I have a suggestion.

153
00:14:22,828 --> 00:14:24,330
-What is it?
-Attack!

154
00:14:25,631 --> 00:14:27,499
-Banana!
-Oh, my, what will I eat first?

155
00:14:27,566 --> 00:14:29,235
-Thank you.
-I'll have this.

156
00:14:39,078 --> 00:14:40,880
-Hello, sir?
-<i>Where is Manalo?</i>

157
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:43,716
Why isn't he answering my calls?

158
00:14:43,782 --> 00:14:47,186
Sir, he was invited by Mr. Fayad.
He's with Dr. Dela Cruz.

159
00:14:47,253 --> 00:14:48,220
<i>He reported to you.</i>

160
00:14:48,687 --> 00:14:50,422
Well then, I'll just say this to you.

161
00:14:51,657 --> 00:14:53,592
Relay all my messages to him.

162
00:14:53,659 --> 00:14:54,760
Yes, sir.

163
00:14:58,998 --> 00:15:01,867
Guys, I need to report to base.

164
00:15:01,934 --> 00:15:05,070
-Sergeant Tamayo, you'll be in charge.
-Yes, sir.

165
00:15:05,137 --> 00:15:06,538
I'll go with you.

166
00:15:06,605 --> 00:15:08,974
I need to get some things
that I left there.

167
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:16,348
It's delicious, right?

168
00:17:02,154 --> 00:17:03,122
What's with you?

169
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:04,823
If that was alcohol,
you'd be drunk by now.

170
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:06,525
Why are you acting like that to Fayad?

171
00:17:07,126 --> 00:17:08,427
You were being so rude.

172
00:17:09,628 --> 00:17:12,264
You were looking at him
as if you wanted to hit him.

173
00:17:12,331 --> 00:17:14,900
-Is it that obvious?
-Stop it. You should behave.

174
00:17:18,103 --> 00:17:21,273
I can just leave if you want.
That way, you'd have him all to yourself.

175
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:23,042
-That way you can spend time together.
-What?

176
00:17:23,108 --> 00:17:26,812
No, 'cause it's very obvious.
You think I don't notice?

177
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:29,148
You are so amazed by him.

178
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:33,685
You look at him
as if you are enchanted by him, right?

179
00:17:33,752 --> 00:17:36,321
Fine, he's perfect.
He's the son of a prince…

180
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:37,489
Are you jealous?

181
00:17:46,865 --> 00:17:47,966
Yes.

182
00:17:50,035 --> 00:17:51,303
I'm jealous.

183
00:17:55,941 --> 00:17:57,176
So, please…

184
00:17:58,477 --> 00:18:00,212
stay away from him.

185
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:05,551
Stay away from him.

186
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:39,518
We are not together, okay?

187
00:18:39,585 --> 00:18:42,888
So, you don't have a say
on whoever I can be with.

188
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:31,136
Manalo really took advantage
of the situation.

189
00:19:31,203 --> 00:19:34,039
He's even partying
with the son of a prince.

190
00:19:34,106 --> 00:19:35,641
He asked for permission, sir.

191
00:19:35,707 --> 00:19:37,176
How can I not allow him?

192
00:19:37,876 --> 00:19:39,111
But if you think...

193
00:19:41,213 --> 00:19:42,648
his problems are over,

194
00:19:43,882 --> 00:19:45,050
you are wrong.

195
00:19:45,117 --> 00:19:47,653
Because the officials
will not ignore what he did,

196
00:19:47,719 --> 00:19:48,954
what you all did.

197
00:19:49,755 --> 00:19:53,792
Be thankful that Manalo
took all the blame for what happened.

198
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:57,996
If I could have it my way,
you would also be punished.

199
00:19:58,063 --> 00:20:01,266
You didn't even question him
even though you knew he was wrong.

200
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:03,735
Ramos, you're not like Big Boss.

201
00:20:05,737 --> 00:20:06,972
...because he has leverage.

202
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:10,008
Remember Ramos,
you're not like your Big Boss.

203
00:20:10,075 --> 00:20:11,710
So, you should be careful.

204
00:21:02,294 --> 00:21:03,695
I'll take it for safekeeping.

205
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:08,767
Why?

206
00:22:08,293 --> 00:22:09,127
Already?

207
00:22:12,898 --> 00:22:13,965
Hey!

208
00:22:18,036 --> 00:22:18,870
Stop it.

209
00:22:29,848 --> 00:22:33,418
Are you still thinking
about what Colonel Garcia said?

210
00:22:36,888 --> 00:22:38,156
Don't worry about him.

211
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:40,692
He can be really harsh when he's angry.

212
00:22:41,259 --> 00:22:42,527
What he said was right.

213
00:22:44,096 --> 00:22:45,931
I'm not like Captain Manalo.

214
00:22:46,965 --> 00:22:48,633
I'm from a different background.

215
00:22:50,535 --> 00:22:54,106
I will never be on par with either of you.

216
00:22:54,639 --> 00:22:56,108
What are you talking about?

217
00:22:57,409 --> 00:23:00,178
You're a great soldier. You're brave.

218
00:23:00,812 --> 00:23:03,482
That's why Lucas also respects you.

219
00:23:06,251 --> 00:23:07,486
Why are you like that?

220
00:23:08,587 --> 00:23:12,924
Why can't you see what I'm seeing?
You always look down on yourself.

221
00:23:12,991 --> 00:23:15,227
I'm just being realistic, Moira.

222
00:23:15,994 --> 00:23:17,329
We are soldiers.

223
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:20,031
We should be objective
when it comes to making assessments.

224
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:22,868
Not only of ourselves...

225
00:23:23,835 --> 00:23:25,737
but also of our relationships.

226
00:23:26,671 --> 00:23:27,773
Stop the car.

227
00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:33,345
I said, stop the car.

228
00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:33,605
What is up with you!

229
00:24:34,072 --> 00:24:35,440
You're so annoying.

230
00:24:35,974 --> 00:24:37,442
What kind of wish was that?

231
00:24:37,509 --> 00:24:40,812
You asked him to leave and asked for this?
This is all you asked for?

232
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:44,516
He said we could ask for anything.

233
00:24:47,219 --> 00:24:52,123
Why didn't you ask for a trip
to Brunei or Maldives?

234
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:53,425
You're unbelievable.

235
00:24:54,459 --> 00:24:57,028
So, you want us to go to Maldives?

236
00:24:58,597 --> 00:25:01,299
That's not what I mean. What I meant
was that you wasted your card.

237
00:25:01,366 --> 00:25:02,434
You wasted it!

238
00:25:02,501 --> 00:25:05,871
It's not wasted as long
as I get to spend it alone with you.

239
00:25:39,170 --> 00:25:41,373
Seems like we will never
understand each other.

240
00:25:41,439 --> 00:25:43,508
I already told you, we're different.

241
00:25:43,575 --> 00:25:46,411
But why do I like you so much
even if that's the case?

242
00:25:46,478 --> 00:25:49,614
Whatever you do or say,

243
00:25:49,681 --> 00:25:51,883
<i>I will fight for my feelings for you.</i>

244
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:54,019
Hey! Stop bothering him.

245
00:25:56,821 --> 00:25:58,557
I said stop bothering him!

246
00:25:59,424 --> 00:26:01,059
Just follow the Captain's order.

247
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:07,399
Marty!
