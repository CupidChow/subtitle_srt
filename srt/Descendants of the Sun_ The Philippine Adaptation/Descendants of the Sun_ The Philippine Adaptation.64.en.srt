1
00:00:11,244 --> 00:00:12,412
What is that?

2
00:00:12,479 --> 00:00:14,714
They found these
along with the two bodies.

3
00:00:14,781 --> 00:00:16,883
It's hard to conclude
if they're Captain Manalo

4
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:18,952
and Technical Sergeant Ramos.

5
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:20,286
That's not Diego.

6
00:00:20,353 --> 00:00:23,857
It will take a while before they can
identify all the victims of the explosion.

7
00:00:23,923 --> 00:00:25,158
That can't be Diego.

8
00:00:26,259 --> 00:00:27,994
It can't be Diego!

9
00:00:29,462 --> 00:00:31,664
It can't be Diego!

10
00:00:31,731 --> 00:00:34,501
Captain Defensor, you need to report
to Camp Aguinaldo.

11
00:00:35,668 --> 00:00:36,836
You are no longer safe here.

12
00:00:36,903 --> 00:00:38,972
Especially you, Doctor Dela Cruz.

13
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:40,306
How about Lucas?

14
00:00:41,474 --> 00:00:43,843
Where are they right now?
What happened to them?

15
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:47,047
You're not even sure
if the bodies found are theirs.

16
00:00:47,113 --> 00:00:51,184
I won't hesitate to use force
if you will not follow my order.

17
00:00:51,651 --> 00:00:54,487
Please give this to Lucas.
He might look for it.

18
00:00:55,021 --> 00:00:56,689
Is there really no update yet?

19
00:00:58,658 --> 00:01:00,860
I'm not losing hope.

20
00:01:00,927 --> 00:01:04,330
<i>As long as it has not been confirmed
that the bodies found are theirs,</i>

21
00:01:04,397 --> 00:01:06,800
<i>I won't believe they are dead.</i>

22
00:01:08,668 --> 00:01:11,471
We found this together
with Technical Sergeant Ramos's stuff.

23
00:01:11,538 --> 00:01:12,839
What is the meaning of this?

24
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:16,076
It is the team's practice
to write a letter to our loved ones

25
00:01:16,142 --> 00:01:18,111
before a mission or an assignment.

26
00:01:18,178 --> 00:01:20,013
<i>Just in case something happens.</i>

27
00:02:15,068 --> 00:02:16,069
Moira?

28
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:19,005
Moira, what's the meaning of this?

29
00:02:31,751 --> 00:02:35,288
Moira, why did they give these to us?

30
00:02:36,456 --> 00:02:38,925
Are they saying
that Lucas and Diego are gone?

31
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:40,527
That they are no longer returning?

32
00:02:41,394 --> 00:02:42,629
Moira, tell me!

33
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:46,332
-What did your dad say?
-I also don't know, Maxine.

34
00:02:47,066 --> 00:02:49,636
Dad won't tell me anything.

35
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:58,711
Every time I look at him,
all I see is pity in his eyes.

36
00:03:01,581 --> 00:03:03,483
I'm also losing hope.

37
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:10,590
Moira, this can't be.

38
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:16,062
That can't be the last time I saw Lucas.
I won't allow it.

39
00:03:16,129 --> 00:03:17,130
Maxine.

40
00:03:24,971 --> 00:03:28,007
I didn't have a chance to talk to him.

41
00:03:30,076 --> 00:03:32,245
I still have a lot of things
to say to him.

42
00:03:33,947 --> 00:03:38,384
I didn't even get to hug him.

43
00:03:41,454 --> 00:03:45,525
We still have to fix things between us.
It can't end like this.

44
00:03:45,592 --> 00:03:46,960
This can't be happening.

45
00:03:47,427 --> 00:03:49,095
I don't want this, Moira.

46
00:04:41,447 --> 00:04:43,316
Big Boss, run!

47
00:04:52,058 --> 00:04:54,761
Rise and shine, my dear guests.

48
00:05:02,035 --> 00:05:03,069
It's Manalo.

49
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:04,904
He's with his right-hand man.

50
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:14,547
It looks like they've been wiped out.
I think the Alpha Team has been destroyed.

51
00:06:09,569 --> 00:06:12,105
Go ahead and check their wounds.

52
00:06:27,186 --> 00:06:28,755
All healed, Bullet.

53
00:06:31,991 --> 00:06:35,395
Go ahead and feed them.

54
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:40,433
Their suffering will end soon.

55
00:06:46,172 --> 00:06:49,342
Why? Are you going to let us go?

56
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:51,878
Something like that.

57
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:57,950
Are you excited to go home?

58
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:30,216
-Are you okay, Big Boss?
-I'm fine.

59
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:32,151
They are really cocky.

60
00:07:32,718 --> 00:07:35,188
I would have knocked them off
if we're not tied up.

61
00:07:36,422 --> 00:07:38,858
I think they have something
planned for us.

62
00:07:40,026 --> 00:07:42,395
We need to think of a way to escape.

63
00:07:46,265 --> 00:07:47,900
What do you see on your side?

64
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:53,206
What they used to feed us earlier.
They left the glass here.

65
00:08:30,209 --> 00:08:32,144
Hurry, they might come back.

66
00:08:33,045 --> 00:08:36,082
I'm almost done, Big Boss.
Just a little more.

67
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:40,620
Big Boss, be on the lookout.

68
00:08:42,321 --> 00:08:43,523
Still clear.

69
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:47,393
The bodies were severely burned.

70
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:51,230
It's still hard to identify
all the victims of the explosion.

71
00:08:56,536 --> 00:09:01,207
If Captain Manalo
and Sergeant Ramos survived,

72
00:09:01,274 --> 00:09:03,809
they would have returned
to the camp by now.

73
00:09:08,314 --> 00:09:10,416
We already know that, General.

74
00:09:11,617 --> 00:09:13,586
Just be frank with us.

75
00:09:29,702 --> 00:09:32,238
There is a service to honor them.

76
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:36,075
We're hoping you could come.

77
00:09:41,447 --> 00:09:42,415
But, Dad…

78
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:45,718
it's only been a month
since they went missing.

79
00:09:50,222 --> 00:09:52,725
They have been loyal to you.

80
00:09:52,792 --> 00:09:54,727
And you will give up on them
just like that?

81
00:09:55,294 --> 00:09:57,496
This is also not easy for me, Moira.

82
00:10:03,536 --> 00:10:05,104
But this is the protocol.

83
00:10:07,573 --> 00:10:13,646
I want to give Captain Manalo
and Sergeant Ramos…

84
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:16,949
an honorable recognition

85
00:10:17,016 --> 00:10:20,186
after all their sacrifices
for the country.

86
00:10:21,153 --> 00:10:22,054
No.

87
00:10:23,222 --> 00:10:24,290
I will not go.

88
00:10:24,357 --> 00:10:26,425
I will not say goodbye to Diego.

89
00:10:28,394 --> 00:10:29,528
I don't want to.

90
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:33,559
You think I've forgiven you
from betraying me.

91
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:36,462
Get rid of his body.

92
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:55,715
Are you ready
for your last mission?

93
00:11:56,849 --> 00:11:58,084
What mission?

94
00:12:01,353 --> 00:12:02,788
You want to go home, right?

95
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:04,356
Why?

96
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:07,059
What do you want us to do?

97
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,361
It's simple.

98
00:12:11,297 --> 00:12:12,998
You just have to wear that vest.

99
00:12:15,201 --> 00:12:17,570
Then, we'll take you
to your camp in Urdan.

100
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:20,973
I'm sure your troops will meet you there.

101
00:12:22,308 --> 00:12:24,176
And while you are celebrating…

102
00:12:26,479 --> 00:12:29,148
you will all go to hell together.

103
00:12:35,521 --> 00:12:37,022
You're crazy.

104
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:41,861
Who told you we would do that?

105
00:12:43,462 --> 00:12:45,231
There's nothing you can do about it.

106
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:02,648
Go ahead!

107
00:13:04,583 --> 00:13:05,851
Put it down!

108
00:13:09,221 --> 00:13:10,656
I said put it down!

109
00:13:10,723 --> 00:13:12,691
-Put it down!
-No.

110
00:13:13,692 --> 00:13:15,594
We'll all die here together.

111
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:18,297
Why? You think I'm afraid to die?

112
00:13:19,565 --> 00:13:21,667
-Bullet, what are you doing?
-Put it down.

113
00:13:21,734 --> 00:13:23,202
I don't want to die.

114
00:13:23,269 --> 00:13:24,270
No!

115
00:13:29,608 --> 00:13:30,843
Go ahead!

116
00:13:32,344 --> 00:13:36,315
You planned this for a long time,
but you still failed.

117
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:38,117
You better surrender.

118
00:13:39,285 --> 00:13:40,653
Can't you see?

119
00:13:41,787 --> 00:13:44,089
Your boss doesn't care about you.

120
00:13:45,191 --> 00:13:49,261
Your leader doesn't care about you.
He will let you die.

121
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:52,798
Just surrender
and return to your families.

122
00:13:53,265 --> 00:13:55,100
I'm sure someone is waiting for you.

123
00:13:59,138 --> 00:14:00,172
Rodel.

124
00:14:04,243 --> 00:14:05,411
Just surrender.

125
00:14:06,445 --> 00:14:08,147
Maxine is waiting for you.

126
00:14:10,649 --> 00:14:12,518
Your mother is waiting for you.

127
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:16,288
Just return to your family.

128
00:14:17,256 --> 00:14:19,225
I have no family!

129
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:21,093
Maxine betrayed me.

130
00:14:22,294 --> 00:14:26,665
If my plan will not succeed
and if you will all betray me too,

131
00:14:29,068 --> 00:14:31,003
then let's all die together!

132
00:14:34,173 --> 00:14:37,877
Now I can kill Alpha Team's Big Boss.

133
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:41,013
Let's all die together here!

134
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:27,159
Just surrender.

135
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:25,684
General, the PRG members here
have decreased in numbers.

136
00:16:26,418 --> 00:16:28,420
We've been here for a month

137
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:31,357
and we could feel
that their force has weakened.

138
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:35,427
<i>And right now,
you've seen the last of them.</i>

139
00:16:40,065 --> 00:16:42,668
<i>Finally, Urdan will be peaceful.</i>

140
00:16:43,602 --> 00:16:46,271
<i>Thanks to you, Big Boss and Wolf.</i>

141
00:17:08,794 --> 00:17:11,430
We won't be seeing each other
for a long time, Marty.

142
00:17:13,098 --> 00:17:15,434
You asked to be reassigned
to a remote area

143
00:17:15,501 --> 00:17:18,370
so we can no longer contact you.

144
00:17:21,473 --> 00:17:22,474
Ma'am.

145
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:28,914
Are you really not going
to the memorial service of Master Ramos?

146
00:17:32,684 --> 00:17:37,122
This time,
it's my turn to run away, Marty.

147
00:17:40,359 --> 00:17:42,428
I can't say goodbye to him.

148
00:17:44,797 --> 00:17:46,198
That's why I admire you.

149
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,601
I know this is also hard for you.

150
00:17:53,639 --> 00:17:57,810
I can pay what he owes you.
This is my wallet.

151
00:17:57,876 --> 00:18:01,013
Whoever can grab this from me
can have the money.

152
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,548
Why would you do that for him?

153
00:18:02,614 --> 00:18:04,716
I'm his brother.

154
00:18:04,783 --> 00:18:08,287
-What is your name again?
-Marty. Marty Talledo.

155
00:18:08,353 --> 00:18:09,788
Talledo.

156
00:18:10,522 --> 00:18:11,523
I'm Marty's brother.

157
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:12,724
Just a brotherly advice.

158
00:18:14,126 --> 00:18:15,627
Don't waste your life away.

159
00:18:15,694 --> 00:18:19,298
There are many challenges,
but it's good to live.

160
00:18:22,634 --> 00:18:24,736
It's not too late for you to change.

161
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:26,872
I will help you.

162
00:18:31,043 --> 00:18:35,914
Ever since Technical Sergeant Ramos
helped me…

163
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:39,885
he became my family.

164
00:18:42,221 --> 00:18:44,256
So even though it's hard to accept
that he's gone…

165
00:18:46,692 --> 00:18:47,960
I'm still going.

166
00:18:49,995 --> 00:18:53,699
I'm going to give honor to the person
who gave direction to my life.

167
00:18:57,569 --> 00:18:59,838
I know Diego will be proud of you.

168
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:02,040
Wherever he is.

169
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:44,616
<i>I wonder how this ship got here?</i>

170
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:51,857
It's here because it has grown
to love this place.

171
00:19:57,296 --> 00:19:58,664
Like me.

172
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,901
I've also grown to love you.

173
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:54,319
I don't care if it's difficult,
complicated, or scary.

174
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:57,522
At least I will have no regrets.

175
00:20:58,156 --> 00:21:00,626
I will not regret that I did not tell you.

176
00:21:02,961 --> 00:21:04,763
I love you, Lucas.

177
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:06,198
Is what you said true?

178
00:21:07,165 --> 00:21:08,567
What did you say?

179
00:21:08,634 --> 00:21:11,703
-You don't want it? Okay.
-No, no.

180
00:21:12,337 --> 00:21:14,072
I've waited long for this.

181
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:17,242
I didn't know you kept it.

182
00:21:20,712 --> 00:21:25,684
If it's special to you,
you will take care of it.

183
00:21:56,948 --> 00:21:58,684
I'm sorry, Lucas.

184
00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:09,094
I don't have the courage to go.

185
00:22:22,507 --> 00:22:23,575
Please take care.

186
00:23:43,922 --> 00:23:45,757
Lucas, you told me you'll come back.

187
00:23:51,196 --> 00:23:54,800
You said you will not allow me
to miss you too much, remember?

188
00:24:03,975 --> 00:24:06,545
I still have a lot of things
to tell you.

189
00:24:12,050 --> 00:24:16,321
I want to say sorry because…

190
00:24:19,357 --> 00:24:20,959
I didn't fight for you.

191
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:26,965
I'm sorry if I ran away.

192
00:24:28,066 --> 00:24:31,102
I know I shouldn't have done that.

193
00:24:38,043 --> 00:24:39,544
I love you, Lucas.

194
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:42,747
I love you so much.

195
00:25:18,016 --> 00:25:19,784
I'm ready to forget the past.

196
00:25:19,851 --> 00:25:21,319
If you will permit us,

197
00:25:21,386 --> 00:25:24,623
I want to start a new life
with your daughter.

198
00:25:24,689 --> 00:25:26,391
We've been through a lot.

199
00:25:26,458 --> 00:25:30,362
But, look, we're still here.

200
00:25:30,428 --> 00:25:33,064
There's no one else
I want to be with, but you.

201
00:25:34,432 --> 00:25:36,701
That's why I want to do this here.
