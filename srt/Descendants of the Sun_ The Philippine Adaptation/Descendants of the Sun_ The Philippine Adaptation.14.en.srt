1
00:00:11,244 --> 00:00:13,279
We have a visual of Alif Fayad.

2
00:00:13,346 --> 00:00:14,547
<i>We're ready to move.</i>

3
00:00:14,614 --> 00:00:16,516
This is going to be a big ransom.

4
00:00:27,093 --> 00:00:29,162
Get out! Where do you think you're going?

5
00:00:42,242 --> 00:00:43,243
Just surrender!

6
00:00:43,309 --> 00:00:45,078
We know you have a fake hostage.

7
00:00:48,081 --> 00:00:50,850
It seems like your troop
has been wiped out, Captain.

8
00:01:02,929 --> 00:01:04,964
<i>What kind of negligence is this, Manalo?</i>

9
00:01:05,031 --> 00:01:06,266
How did it come to this?

10
00:01:08,034 --> 00:01:09,569
Of course you should be blamed!

11
00:03:12,559 --> 00:03:14,360
Manalo, don't argue with them.

12
00:03:14,427 --> 00:03:16,563
Tell the doctor to give them
what they want.

13
00:03:16,629 --> 00:03:19,465
Sir, the patient is in critical condition.

14
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:21,568
I know! But you still have
to follow their orders.

15
00:03:21,634 --> 00:03:22,969
If something happens to him,

16
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:26,606
blame the doctor
because she didn't do her job.

17
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:36,516
Lucas, we can't stay here for long.

18
00:03:37,417 --> 00:03:38,351
Doc…

19
00:03:39,385 --> 00:03:40,453
can you save him?

20
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,588
What?

21
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:48,228
-I need to know the extent of--
-Can you save him? Yes or no?

22
00:03:49,696 --> 00:03:53,333
What are you doing, Manalo?
Just do as I say. That's an order!

23
00:03:55,368 --> 00:03:56,202
Maxine…

24
00:03:57,770 --> 00:03:59,372
I need to hear it from you.

25
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,208
Can you save him?

26
00:04:05,678 --> 00:04:06,713
Yes, I can.

27
00:04:22,195 --> 00:04:23,029
Do it!

28
00:05:45,445 --> 00:05:46,446
Don't mind them.

29
00:05:46,913 --> 00:05:48,981
We're here to do our job.

30
00:05:49,749 --> 00:05:51,751
We have to focus to save Mr. Fayad.

31
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,589
<i>What do you think you're doing?</i>

32
00:05:56,656 --> 00:05:58,825
Do you all want
to be discharged from service?

33
00:05:58,891 --> 00:06:00,827
Manalo, stop what you're doing

34
00:06:01,394 --> 00:06:03,262
<i>before I report this to the higher ups.</i>

35
00:06:05,832 --> 00:06:07,467
Manalo!

36
00:06:09,102 --> 00:06:11,437
Damn it! Where is my phone?

37
00:06:13,172 --> 00:06:15,775
We're coordinating
with relevant departments.

38
00:06:15,842 --> 00:06:18,077
If Alif Fayad dies in Urdan,

39
00:06:18,144 --> 00:06:20,246
it will cause a big problem
for the whole country.

40
00:06:20,313 --> 00:06:22,448
He didn't go there to start a war.

41
00:06:26,419 --> 00:06:29,355
Is that about Maxine?
What's happening in Urdan?

42
00:06:29,422 --> 00:06:32,225
Talk to your friend.
She is causing trouble.

43
00:06:32,291 --> 00:06:33,826
-Should I call her?
-No.

44
00:06:34,293 --> 00:06:35,762
Don't disturb her.

45
00:07:00,987 --> 00:07:02,889
The patient is crashing. Defib!

46
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:30,917
Administer Epi.

47
00:07:42,495 --> 00:07:44,464
<i>What's happening there, Ramos?</i>

48
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:47,133
There's a little problem
with the operation, sir.

49
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,168
You're really trying to kill me tonight?

50
00:07:49,235 --> 00:07:52,338
I didn't survive the field
just to die of cardiac arrest.

51
00:07:52,405 --> 00:07:55,908
<i>I've already reported what you did</i>
<i>to the higher ups, especially Manalo.</i>

52
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:58,544
<i>Just pray that nothing happens to Fayad.</i>

53
00:07:58,611 --> 00:08:00,580
I'm on my way there. Wait for me.

54
00:08:10,857 --> 00:08:12,091
Doc, let me.

55
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:14,060
Let me.

56
00:08:17,964 --> 00:08:19,465
Nothing still, no improvement.

57
00:08:30,276 --> 00:08:31,277
Still nothing, Doc.

58
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:32,245
Let's do defib.

59
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:55,227
Captain Moira.

60
00:09:56,729 --> 00:09:59,632
How is the kind foreigner doing?

61
00:10:00,633 --> 00:10:03,269
He might not come back here anymore?

62
00:10:03,736 --> 00:10:09,342
I'm sure he'll remember
how you welcomed him here.

63
00:10:10,977 --> 00:10:13,312
What happened to him
has nothing to do with you.

64
00:10:15,181 --> 00:10:16,115
Okay.

65
00:10:23,422 --> 00:10:24,256
Captain?

66
00:10:25,091 --> 00:10:27,093
They're doing okay inside.

67
00:10:27,159 --> 00:10:29,829
Sir Diego is safe.

68
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,402
I didn't ask.

69
00:10:37,169 --> 00:10:40,106
Don't worry, ma'am, I won't tell on you.

70
00:10:44,944 --> 00:10:45,778
Sir.

71
00:10:46,746 --> 00:10:47,847
Where are they?

72
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:26,018
All of you, follow me.

73
00:11:37,663 --> 00:11:39,198
He still disobeyed his orders.

74
00:11:47,473 --> 00:11:49,008
How is Maxine?

75
00:11:53,646 --> 00:11:57,016
What's important
is that Mr. Fayad is safe.

76
00:12:32,952 --> 00:12:36,522
He's so grouchy.
We just saved his patient.

77
00:12:38,691 --> 00:12:42,461
Do an abstract of the operation
so we can provide it for them.

78
00:12:42,528 --> 00:12:43,629
Yes, Doc.

79
00:12:45,331 --> 00:12:47,166
-I don't know.
-I'm not sure.

80
00:12:47,233 --> 00:12:48,634
What are you guys murmuring about?

81
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:52,772
I had nothing.

82
00:12:54,006 --> 00:12:55,441
Guys, excuse me.

83
00:12:55,908 --> 00:12:57,843
What are you guys murmuring about?

84
00:12:57,910 --> 00:12:59,979
That gauze pads that we used…

85
00:13:00,045 --> 00:13:02,181
And the instruments.

86
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:04,450
Did you check the scalpel?

87
00:13:05,751 --> 00:13:06,719
-No.
-What?

88
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:09,121
Are you telling me
we left it inside the patient?

89
00:13:10,489 --> 00:13:12,391
We'll go back inside to check.

90
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:13,859
Yes. We'll check it.

91
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:20,499
I'm sure they are just joking.

92
00:13:20,566 --> 00:13:22,168
I hope so.

93
00:13:25,437 --> 00:13:27,673
Am I right, Doc? They were joking, right?

94
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:33,512
Excuse me, I just have
to check on something.

95
00:13:38,417 --> 00:13:40,019
Why do you think so highly of yourself?

96
00:13:40,085 --> 00:13:42,354
-You can't even follow a direct order.
-Sorry, sir.

97
00:13:42,421 --> 00:13:45,057
Now it's sir. But earlier,
you turned off the radio on me.

98
00:13:45,124 --> 00:13:47,159
What now, Manalo?
Where did your pride bring you?

99
00:13:47,226 --> 00:13:50,162
I've been wondering
why you haven't been promoted.

100
00:13:50,229 --> 00:13:51,230
Now I know.

101
00:13:51,297 --> 00:13:53,899
You will not be promoted
with that kind of attitude.

102
00:13:53,966 --> 00:13:57,436
If I won't be promoted
because of what happened tonight,

103
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:01,207
-I still have no regrets, sir.
-What did you say?

104
00:14:07,146 --> 00:14:10,115
All the calls I made
were for the safety of Mr. Fayad.

105
00:14:10,182 --> 00:14:11,517
Now, if that's the punishment

106
00:14:11,584 --> 00:14:14,420
for the wrong decisions I made,
I will accept it.

107
00:14:14,887 --> 00:14:17,389
Stand by those decisions
while the mosquitoes feast on you here.

108
00:14:28,067 --> 00:14:30,703
It doesn't look like you're injured.

109
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:36,075
We should worry about Captain Manalo.

110
00:14:36,675 --> 00:14:37,810
They're picking on him.

111
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:39,411
He knows what he did.

112
00:14:39,478 --> 00:14:40,746
He just did what is right.

113
00:14:41,747 --> 00:14:42,982
That's how a leader should be.

114
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:46,385
Brave and principled.

115
00:14:46,452 --> 00:14:49,321
That's why I am not surprised
that the General chose him…

116
00:14:51,323 --> 00:14:52,157
for you.

117
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:53,225
What?

118
00:14:53,292 --> 00:14:54,326
He's right.

119
00:14:57,997 --> 00:15:00,532
You deserve someone like Captain Manalo.

120
00:15:40,072 --> 00:15:40,973
Dr. Dela Cruz.

121
00:15:43,142 --> 00:15:44,043
Yes?

122
00:15:44,476 --> 00:15:46,979
I'm Colonel Garcia. How is Mr. Fayad?

123
00:15:47,046 --> 00:15:48,347
Will he survive?

124
00:15:48,414 --> 00:15:49,915
He's young and strong.

125
00:15:49,982 --> 00:15:52,318
He has a strong chance
to recover from this.

126
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:55,154
Is that why you insisted on the operation

127
00:15:55,921 --> 00:15:57,957
even though you knew
the situation was complicated?

128
00:15:58,023 --> 00:15:59,725
I just did what was right.

129
00:16:00,492 --> 00:16:04,897
He needed the surgery and as a doctor,
it's my duty to save his life.

130
00:16:05,431 --> 00:16:08,968
Captain Manalo's duty
is to follow orders from his superiors.

131
00:16:09,034 --> 00:16:11,603
But what did he do?
He disobeyed them for your operation.

132
00:16:13,939 --> 00:16:16,075
Do you know what could happen to him?

133
00:16:16,141 --> 00:16:18,677
His career will not only be destroyed,

134
00:16:18,744 --> 00:16:21,647
he can also go to jail
if Mr. Fayad doesn't wake up.

135
00:16:22,748 --> 00:16:23,649
I had no idea.

136
00:16:28,354 --> 00:16:30,322
…so we can all save our jobs.

137
00:16:38,564 --> 00:16:40,432
You know what to do.

138
00:16:41,367 --> 00:16:43,135
I don't need to say it to each one of you.

139
00:16:45,404 --> 00:16:48,040
Tell the boys I'm thankful.

140
00:16:48,607 --> 00:16:52,845
You followed me
even though you know you'd get in trouble.

141
00:16:53,645 --> 00:16:54,880
No problem, Big Boss.

142
00:16:59,551 --> 00:17:03,122
Hey. Forget the salute.

143
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:05,124
You're in charge now.

144
00:17:07,626 --> 00:17:08,761
I think…

145
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,564
they shouldn't do this to you.

146
00:17:13,265 --> 00:17:16,268
The whole team didn't follow you
because of your rank.

147
00:17:17,669 --> 00:17:21,340
We followed because we believe in you,
and we know that what you did was right.

148
00:17:23,075 --> 00:17:24,576
That's why we respected your decisions.

149
00:17:39,024 --> 00:17:39,958
By the way…

150
00:17:41,126 --> 00:17:42,361
I have a gift for you.

151
00:17:43,395 --> 00:17:44,363
Just wait for it.

152
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:49,168
Is that food?

153
00:17:49,935 --> 00:17:51,603
Perfect. I'm starving.

154
00:17:52,471 --> 00:17:55,574
I want something with soup
and with some sauce, please.

155
00:18:16,495 --> 00:18:17,362
Talledo…

156
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:19,198
is that you?

157
00:18:20,232 --> 00:18:21,366
What food did you bring?

158
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:27,539
Hey, Marty, what did you cook?

159
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:32,444
Lucas?

160
00:19:04,076 --> 00:19:05,244
Maxine…

161
00:19:05,944 --> 00:19:07,212
are you crying?

162
00:19:09,748 --> 00:19:12,050
Why didn't you tell me?

163
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:19,124
You could've stopped me…
You wouldn't be there now if you did.

164
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:22,928
I could have…

165
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:29,001
But I knew you would be restless
if you weren't able to help that man.

166
00:19:30,302 --> 00:19:31,637
You're a doctor.

167
00:19:32,771 --> 00:19:35,040
You took an oath to save lives, right?

168
00:19:38,243 --> 00:19:39,745
I just respected that.

169
00:19:42,915 --> 00:19:46,418
You have so much trust in me.

170
00:19:46,485 --> 00:19:47,319
Of course.

171
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:51,657
I really admire you. You are brave.

172
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:56,461
You weren't scared
even with a gun pointed at you.

173
00:19:59,231 --> 00:20:01,233
Even I was scared for you.

174
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:04,069
What, you?

175
00:20:04,803 --> 00:20:05,671
Scared?

176
00:20:07,806 --> 00:20:09,408
It didn't seem like it.

177
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:13,946
I'm just good at hiding it.

178
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:19,484
I wouldn't know what to do
if something bad ever happens to you.

179
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:25,958
We've been through a lot, huh?

180
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:30,262
It was scary.

181
00:20:33,432 --> 00:20:34,900
Really scary.

182
00:20:37,636 --> 00:20:38,837
But you were tough.

183
00:20:41,006 --> 00:20:42,274
You're cool.

184
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:47,246
So this means nothing.

185
00:20:49,281 --> 00:20:50,215
It's nothing.

186
00:21:11,903 --> 00:21:13,872
Do you have a grenade there?

187
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:15,674
-What?
-A grenade.

188
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:20,312
I just want to blast through the door
and stop you from crying.

189
00:21:20,379 --> 00:21:21,780
To hug you…

190
00:21:23,015 --> 00:21:24,216
and kiss you.

191
00:21:39,164 --> 00:21:40,232
Lucas…

192
00:21:40,999 --> 00:21:45,103
Lucas, Diego told me
that I can't stay here for too long.

193
00:21:45,871 --> 00:21:46,938
I need to leave.

194
00:21:48,607 --> 00:21:49,541
Here.

195
00:22:03,555 --> 00:22:04,656
Thank you.

196
00:22:07,392 --> 00:22:09,261
I really need this.

197
00:22:11,863 --> 00:22:12,998
All right.

198
00:22:13,799 --> 00:22:14,666
Bye.

199
00:23:45,824 --> 00:23:47,526
It's Alif! He's awake.

200
00:23:49,227 --> 00:23:50,829
We'll become famous.

201
00:23:50,896 --> 00:23:53,265
We are the ones
who saved Alif Fayad's life.

202
00:23:53,732 --> 00:23:55,734
We will be famous, especially you Maxine.

203
00:24:16,755 --> 00:24:18,023
Mr. Fayad…

204
00:24:18,890 --> 00:24:19,891
is awake.

205
00:24:22,093 --> 00:24:24,529
But it'll take a few more days
before he can be transferred.

206
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:26,431
He needs to get stronger.

207
00:24:29,134 --> 00:24:30,302
That's good to know.

208
00:24:36,708 --> 00:24:40,011
Keep an eye on that Fayad.
He might make a move on one of the girls.

209
00:24:46,585 --> 00:24:48,520
You still haven't had that checked?

210
00:24:49,087 --> 00:24:50,355
The Medicube is just there.

211
00:24:50,422 --> 00:24:51,490
I don't have to.

212
00:24:52,457 --> 00:24:54,192
This is just a minor wound.

213
00:24:54,693 --> 00:24:55,927
Besides…

214
00:24:55,994 --> 00:24:57,796
I don't want Moira to know about this.

215
00:25:01,066 --> 00:25:03,735
If Fayad makes a move on Moira?
Is that okay with you?

216
00:25:10,275 --> 00:25:11,743
I told you, keep an eye on him.

217
00:25:44,543 --> 00:25:45,710
<i>Alif is really special.</i>

218
00:25:45,777 --> 00:25:49,581
He's a man with a heart.
He's so rich and yet so sincere.

219
00:25:49,648 --> 00:25:51,016
Someday I'll be like him.

220
00:25:51,082 --> 00:25:52,851
And then what? You'll get kidnapped too?

221
00:25:52,918 --> 00:25:55,020
-Captain Manalo is also rich.
-Really, sir?

222
00:25:55,687 --> 00:25:57,022
Yes, he's rich in courage.

223
00:25:57,088 --> 00:25:58,356
Yeah! That's it!

224
00:25:58,423 --> 00:26:01,192
-Fine, he's perfect. He's a prince, right?
-Are you jealous?

225
00:26:01,293 --> 00:26:04,195
<i>Why did we make things real</i>
<i>if you're just going to leave me?</i>

226
00:26:04,763 --> 00:26:09,134
Speak up, Diego! What's with you?

227
00:26:13,138 --> 00:26:15,540
<i>I'm sorry if I made you sad.</i>

228
00:26:17,542 --> 00:26:22,013
Of course, I don't want that for you.
I don't want that for the person I love.
