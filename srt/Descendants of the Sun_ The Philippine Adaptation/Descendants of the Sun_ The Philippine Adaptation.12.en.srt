1
00:00:12,145 --> 00:00:13,613
<i>Thank you for coming back.</i>

2
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:16,049
I thought I'd lose you in my life again.

3
00:00:16,116 --> 00:00:18,051
It's my calling to help others.

4
00:00:18,118 --> 00:00:20,220
<i>It's also my duty as a doctor.</i>

5
00:00:20,286 --> 00:00:24,090
<i>Of course, as a soldier,</i>
<i>it's my duty to protect you.</i>

6
00:00:24,157 --> 00:00:25,925
<i>So I'll be with you wherever you go.</i>

7
00:00:25,992 --> 00:00:27,160
I'm done.

8
00:00:27,227 --> 00:00:29,329
Let's just eat and have
coffee in the camp.

9
00:00:35,402 --> 00:00:36,669
<i>You will obey me.</i>

10
00:00:36,736 --> 00:00:37,737
<i>Leave my daughter.</i>

11
00:00:37,804 --> 00:00:41,041
Do I need to be in an accident again
so you can face me properly?

12
00:00:41,107 --> 00:00:43,309
Aren't you even happy that I'm here too?

13
00:00:43,376 --> 00:00:45,645
They say that if you get a pebble
from this beach,

14
00:00:45,712 --> 00:00:47,113
you will definitely return.

15
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:49,115
When that day comes for us to return,

16
00:00:49,182 --> 00:00:50,750
I hope we are already a couple.

17
00:01:03,263 --> 00:01:04,431
Maxine?

18
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,302
They might be looking for us at the camp.

19
00:01:22,549 --> 00:01:23,917
Sorry. I thought…

20
00:01:24,517 --> 00:01:25,418
You thought what?

21
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,289
I thought we were okay.

22
00:01:29,355 --> 00:01:31,658
You even got jealous with the waitress.

23
00:01:31,724 --> 00:01:34,094
Me? Me, jealous?

24
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:35,028
Weren't you?

25
00:01:36,129 --> 00:01:37,964
Aren't you a little presumptuous?

26
00:01:38,665 --> 00:01:41,301
I should've let you
have your coffee there.

27
00:01:41,801 --> 00:01:44,137
That way, you'd jump out of your skin.

28
00:01:45,905 --> 00:01:46,840
I'm sorry.

29
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:55,415
Maxine, wait.

30
00:01:55,482 --> 00:01:56,549
Maxine…

31
00:01:58,718 --> 00:02:00,086
Are you still mad at me?

32
00:02:01,654 --> 00:02:03,323
Haven't you forgiven me yet?

33
00:02:03,857 --> 00:02:06,226
Is this still about your anger
towards soldiers?

34
00:02:14,167 --> 00:02:15,935
That's sad, Lucas.

35
00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:20,974
But that doesn't mean…

36
00:02:21,941 --> 00:02:24,844
that I will just accept
whoever professes their love for me.

37
00:02:29,749 --> 00:02:33,653
But it seems sadder
to be in a relationship where…

38
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:36,890
you're always left on your own.

39
00:02:39,726 --> 00:02:43,196
You can say that I'm clingy or needy.

40
00:02:45,865 --> 00:02:48,201
But if I ever get into a relationship…

41
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:52,805
I want to be with someone
I can always be with.

42
00:02:54,607 --> 00:02:55,608
I understand.

43
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:05,552
I won't lie to you and say
that day won't come.

44
00:03:05,618 --> 00:03:07,820
That I won't leave you
because I'm a soldier.

45
00:03:09,589 --> 00:03:11,691
We both know that will never happen.

46
00:03:14,427 --> 00:03:15,628
But I understand you.

47
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:31,945
How I wish you were just an accountant.

48
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:08,875
What is it?

49
00:05:12,378 --> 00:05:13,980
We'll be here for a long time, right?

50
00:05:15,214 --> 00:05:17,050
I don't want things
to be awkward between us.

51
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:19,786
We can be friends.

52
00:05:27,527 --> 00:05:28,428
Okay.

53
00:05:41,908 --> 00:05:42,742
Give me that.

54
00:05:43,376 --> 00:05:44,811
I'm okay. You can leave now.

55
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:52,952
Be patient with Master Ramos.

56
00:05:53,753 --> 00:05:57,123
He's just like that.
He looks tough, but he has a soft heart.

57
00:05:57,724 --> 00:05:59,158
How do you know that?

58
00:06:00,426 --> 00:06:04,997
I'm not related to him,
but he's the reason why I got in here.

59
00:06:05,064 --> 00:06:08,067
If it wasn't for him, my life
would probably be a mess right now.

60
00:06:08,134 --> 00:06:10,536
It's good to know
that Diego didn't change.

61
00:06:10,603 --> 00:06:12,772
He's just not the same
when it comes to me.

62
00:06:46,973 --> 00:06:48,441
Good thing you're back.

63
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:52,145
We have a briefing,
together with the medical team.

64
00:06:52,678 --> 00:06:55,248
Briefing? The base didn't inform me.

65
00:06:55,314 --> 00:06:56,649
Who will be conducting it?

66
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:01,788
I know him.

67
00:07:04,757 --> 00:07:07,160
In five days, Mr. Alif Fayad
will be arriving here.

68
00:07:07,226 --> 00:07:10,229
He is a philanthropist
and a son of the Prince of Brunei.

69
00:07:10,296 --> 00:07:14,267
He's coming to give assistance
to the residents of Urdan.

70
00:07:20,573 --> 00:07:23,409
The Special Forces
will provide his security.

71
00:07:23,476 --> 00:07:26,779
I'm sure I don't need to stress
how important his safety is.

72
00:07:26,846 --> 00:07:28,214
He shouldn't come here then.

73
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:30,983
But his assistance
would be a big help to the locals.

74
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:33,586
He can still help,
but he doesn't have to be here.

75
00:07:33,653 --> 00:07:35,822
Urdan is too dangerous for him.

76
00:07:38,591 --> 00:07:39,725
But he refused to listen.

77
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:42,995
He said help is needed where danger is.

78
00:07:43,062 --> 00:07:44,297
That's true.

79
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:46,933
We need to start the preparations.

80
00:07:46,999 --> 00:07:51,270
If all goes well, Alif will be giving
a lot of help to the people of Urdan.

81
00:07:57,910 --> 00:07:59,512
Papi Alif is really handsome.

82
00:08:00,179 --> 00:08:01,614
Did you just call him "Papi"?

83
00:08:02,381 --> 00:08:04,250
Why? Any objections?

84
00:08:05,751 --> 00:08:06,719
We'll look good together.

85
00:08:07,253 --> 00:08:08,888
What about Dr. Earl?

86
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:12,725
I have no time for playboys, okay?

87
00:08:14,293 --> 00:08:17,530
He's not a playboy.
He's just a chick magnet.

88
00:08:17,597 --> 00:08:18,898
It's the same thing.

89
00:08:19,899 --> 00:08:22,168
Come on. Don't ruin the moment.

90
00:08:23,135 --> 00:08:26,706
It's better if we just check
if Papa Alif has abs.

91
00:08:27,974 --> 00:08:29,509
Once I find a signal.

92
00:08:29,575 --> 00:08:30,676
There you go.

93
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:40,086
Do you think he has a girlfriend?

94
00:08:40,152 --> 00:08:41,354
He doesn't.

95
00:08:45,391 --> 00:08:47,093
And how do you know that?

96
00:08:47,159 --> 00:08:48,828
I looked into it already.

97
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:53,399
You act all demure,
but you're a real stalker, aren't you?

98
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:55,001
You're really something.

99
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:56,669
Look at those girls.

100
00:08:58,137 --> 00:09:00,907
They're still not tired
of looking at those pictures.

101
00:09:00,973 --> 00:09:03,809
What does Alif have that we don't anyway?

102
00:09:05,511 --> 00:09:06,546
Let me see.

103
00:09:07,947 --> 00:09:13,052
Luxury cars, tons and tons of money,
bodyguards, what else?

104
00:09:13,119 --> 00:09:14,554
Okay, I get it.

105
00:09:15,154 --> 00:09:19,458
But when it comes to looks,
I'm pretty sure we stand a chance.

106
00:09:19,525 --> 00:09:22,395
Oh, I agree with you. You're not mistaken.

107
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:26,165
Dr. Earl, if you only knew.

108
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:29,769
I'm telling you, a lot of women here
have a crush on you.

109
00:09:29,835 --> 00:09:34,106
That's nothing.
But you know that I like Nurse Emma.

110
00:09:34,874 --> 00:09:38,711
But it's difficult to tame her, Doc.

111
00:09:39,478 --> 00:09:40,346
It really is.

112
00:09:41,547 --> 00:09:44,784
That's how it is. Just always remember…

113
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:48,387
the person you like
usually doesn't like you back.

114
00:09:49,455 --> 00:09:51,023
-What?
-Yes.

115
00:09:55,494 --> 00:09:56,963
I think you give her butterflies.

116
00:09:57,029 --> 00:09:59,031
-I think she looks annoyed.
-You've charmed her..

117
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:00,533
No, look at her.

118
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,734
You can have him.

119
00:10:01,801 --> 00:10:03,069
She's thrilled.

120
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:03,970
Is she?

121
00:10:04,036 --> 00:10:05,504
No, she looks mad.

122
00:10:05,571 --> 00:10:06,872
She does.

123
00:10:09,075 --> 00:10:09,942
It's cold.

124
00:10:10,009 --> 00:10:12,445
It's good that there's
still some rich people

125
00:10:12,511 --> 00:10:15,681
who are willing to help the poor,
people like Alif.

126
00:10:16,215 --> 00:10:17,883
-That's right, sir.
-Where's the soap?

127
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:20,886
But he's not just rich.

128
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:23,956
Let me remind you.
The son of the Prince of Brunei.

129
00:10:24,523 --> 00:10:27,026
So, good luck to all of us,
especially to the Alpha Team.

130
00:10:27,093 --> 00:10:28,761
Have fun protecting him.

131
00:10:29,528 --> 00:10:33,566
That's not a problem.
We are trained for those things.

132
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:37,136
That's right. We are well trained
by Big Boss and Wolf, right?

133
00:10:37,737 --> 00:10:38,604
I know that, sir.

134
00:10:39,872 --> 00:10:41,774
But you have to think about this…

135
00:10:41,841 --> 00:10:45,511
What if the PRG
takes advantage of Alif's arrival?

136
00:10:45,578 --> 00:10:48,347
What if they abduct and kill him?
We'd all be in trouble.

137
00:10:48,414 --> 00:10:50,082
-Hey, calm down.
-Calm down.

138
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:52,184
We already planned for that.

139
00:10:52,251 --> 00:10:55,855
The Alpha team is ready
if they ever cause trouble.

140
00:10:55,921 --> 00:10:57,256
Just relax.

141
00:10:57,323 --> 00:11:00,760
Listen up, kid. Watch your coffee intake.

142
00:11:01,427 --> 00:11:03,329
If you want to become a member
of the Alpha Team,

143
00:11:04,296 --> 00:11:05,998
you can't be too skittish.

144
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,601
They are right, Marty.

145
00:11:09,902 --> 00:11:14,073
And if you're a soldier,
you need to be brave.

146
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:19,278
You should be fearless. Right, buddies?

147
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:20,513
-That's right!
-That's right.

148
00:11:20,579 --> 00:11:22,048
-That's right.
-A snake!

149
00:11:22,114 --> 00:11:23,983
-There's a snake!
-Where?

150
00:11:24,817 --> 00:11:26,352
Brave, huh?

151
00:11:26,786 --> 00:11:27,753
There's no snake.

152
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:29,388
Why, you!

153
00:11:29,455 --> 00:11:32,191
-Marty, you…
-I was kidding! It's just a joke.

154
00:11:32,258 --> 00:11:35,361
-You're crazy.
-Hey, it's cold! Hey!

155
00:11:35,428 --> 00:11:37,363
-Hey, wait!
-There! Go for it.

156
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:39,865
-I'm kidding. You guys are really brave.
-There.

157
00:11:41,467 --> 00:11:43,469
I'm sorry, Doc. I only made a few.

158
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:46,572
But please, post them around
so others will see it.

159
00:11:47,907 --> 00:11:48,974
Thank you, Doc.

160
00:11:49,608 --> 00:11:53,045
Does this mean you'll be visiting
our place again, Doc Beauty?

161
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:56,382
Not just me,
everybody here will go to your place

162
00:11:56,449 --> 00:11:57,950
so we can check up on everyone.

163
00:12:04,323 --> 00:12:06,926
-Here, post these, okay?
-All right.

164
00:12:08,627 --> 00:12:10,262
Here you go.

165
00:12:13,299 --> 00:12:15,401
So you don't forget about it.

166
00:12:18,037 --> 00:12:21,173
Ma'am, post this now, okay?

167
00:12:22,608 --> 00:12:24,944
Then do this.

168
00:12:30,316 --> 00:12:34,086
-Sir, post this, all right?
-What is this?

169
00:12:43,896 --> 00:12:45,564
Bullet, check this out.

170
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:47,800
What is it this time, Greg?

171
00:12:52,972 --> 00:12:54,807
So, aren't we invited?

172
00:13:01,847 --> 00:13:07,253
The universe is playing tricks on me.
I came here to Urdan so I could forget.

173
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:10,523
And now, Lucas is here.

174
00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:12,758
Paulo Coelho said…

175
00:13:17,997 --> 00:13:19,398
That's what's happening.

176
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:22,201
You mean, it's me
who wants to be with Lucas?

177
00:13:22,268 --> 00:13:23,335
Lucky him.

178
00:13:24,036 --> 00:13:27,173
You're both lucky if you end up together.

179
00:13:27,239 --> 00:13:30,609
<i>Can't you try being brave, Maxine?</i>

180
00:13:30,676 --> 00:13:35,447
<i>For once, push aside</i>
<i>your abandonment issues.</i>

181
00:13:35,514 --> 00:13:40,019
It's such a waste.
Lucas seems to be a nice guy.

182
00:13:40,586 --> 00:13:42,321
I have made my decision.

183
00:13:43,289 --> 00:13:44,156
That's it.

184
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:48,327
Besides, my life is already
complicated as it is, right?

185
00:13:48,394 --> 00:13:50,095
Do I really wanna make things worse?

186
00:14:06,812 --> 00:14:08,581
Bring everything inside.

187
00:14:20,226 --> 00:14:23,829
Technical Sergeant Diego Ramos,
you can carry a sack of rice, right?

188
00:14:45,084 --> 00:14:45,951
Moira…

189
00:14:49,288 --> 00:14:51,624
You know I won't question your judgment
in front of others.

190
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:55,160
But please be gentle with Diego.
Don't embarrass him.

191
00:14:56,328 --> 00:14:58,130
I'm not trying to embarrass him.

192
00:14:58,197 --> 00:15:01,166
I'm actually helping him
show his best qualities.

193
00:15:01,934 --> 00:15:03,068
He's strong.

194
00:15:03,135 --> 00:15:06,705
He really can carry heavy stuff.
He's helpful.

195
00:15:06,772 --> 00:15:08,140
Hey, Moira…

196
00:15:09,141 --> 00:15:11,944
Just leave it alone.
This is between the two of us. Okay?

197
00:15:12,478 --> 00:15:16,248
Unless you want me to tell my dad
that we're seeing each other.

198
00:15:17,049 --> 00:15:19,218
-What?
-Yes.

199
00:15:19,285 --> 00:15:21,553
What motif do you want for our wedding?

200
00:15:23,789 --> 00:15:26,492
-Yes.
-Really?

201
00:15:27,359 --> 00:15:28,327
Are you serious?

202
00:15:30,229 --> 00:15:31,096
The two of you?

203
00:15:35,634 --> 00:15:38,404
Is he your soldier boyfriend?

204
00:15:40,306 --> 00:15:43,542
No. It's Technical Sergeant Diego Ramos.

205
00:15:44,476 --> 00:15:47,346
So why did you say that you two
are getting married?

206
00:15:47,413 --> 00:15:48,480
What was that?

207
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:53,986
Actually, we're in a love triangle.

208
00:15:54,053 --> 00:15:56,155
It's a bit complicated.

209
00:15:56,989 --> 00:15:57,990
Right, Lucas?

210
00:16:02,728 --> 00:16:05,030
I shouldn't be out here chatting with you.

211
00:16:05,097 --> 00:16:07,433
Okay. I'll go inside.

212
00:16:07,499 --> 00:16:09,935
Sir, hand me a small box. Yes.

213
00:16:15,407 --> 00:16:17,643
What was that? What are you trying to do?

214
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:20,112
I just wanted to see her reaction.

215
00:16:24,283 --> 00:16:25,150
What do you think?

216
00:16:39,431 --> 00:16:41,066
Help her.

217
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:43,736
Doc, you want me to do that?

218
00:16:44,203 --> 00:16:45,904
No. I'm okay.

219
00:16:53,612 --> 00:16:56,181
Doc, what's the problem?

220
00:17:01,453 --> 00:17:03,989
Relax, we're medical practitioners.

221
00:17:04,056 --> 00:17:06,258
That's too personal.

222
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:07,860
You want personal?

223
00:17:12,564 --> 00:17:14,400
I'm pissed at Lucas.

224
00:17:15,601 --> 00:17:18,103
Good thing, I didn't give him
another chance.

225
00:17:18,637 --> 00:17:22,174
So, he tried to start seeing you again?

226
00:17:23,242 --> 00:17:25,144
I'm so jealous.

227
00:17:26,278 --> 00:17:28,380
It's over. I already turned him down.

228
00:17:29,314 --> 00:17:34,186
I don't want to be involved
in his love triangle with Diego and Moira.

229
00:17:34,253 --> 00:17:35,287
I don't want a part of it.

230
00:17:36,588 --> 00:17:38,891
Where are the other things
we need to bring inside?

231
00:17:50,769 --> 00:17:53,906
I can't bring my arms up
to feed myself, bro.

232
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:59,912
You carried 30 sacks of rice.
Of course you're tired.

233
00:17:59,978 --> 00:18:02,147
The team wanted to help, but you refused.

234
00:18:02,214 --> 00:18:04,216
I just don't want
to irritate Captain Moira.

235
00:18:04,817 --> 00:18:06,718
Why are you letting her order you around?

236
00:18:06,785 --> 00:18:08,487
Stop it, bro.
You're in the Special Forces.

237
00:18:09,021 --> 00:18:10,956
The entire troop
might be dragged into this.

238
00:18:11,023 --> 00:18:13,926
I'm just letting her release
all her anger towards me.

239
00:18:13,992 --> 00:18:18,397
When she's done, maybe her feelings for me
will be gone too.

240
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:28,006
How about you? Are your feelings gone?

241
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:57,836
Be careful crossing the river later, okay?
This might not reach Sitio Santos.

242
00:19:09,748 --> 00:19:10,582
Here it is.

243
00:19:11,383 --> 00:19:17,623
I've already written out the instructions
for Biboy's medicines.

244
00:19:17,689 --> 00:19:21,093
Good thing, we have donors
of anti-seizure medicines.

245
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:24,263
I know. Thanks a lot, Doc Maxine.

246
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:30,602
I really get nervous at night
because Biboy might have an attack.

247
00:19:31,803 --> 00:19:33,071
Don't worry.

248
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:38,810
Continuous medication should help
lessen Biboy' attacks.

249
00:19:38,877 --> 00:19:40,679
Eventually, he won't need it anymore.

250
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:44,082
-Really, Doc Beauty?
-Yes.

251
00:19:44,149 --> 00:19:46,585
When I get well, I will become a soldier.

252
00:19:46,652 --> 00:19:49,588
When I become a soldier,
I will ask you out.

253
00:19:49,655 --> 00:19:53,225
Oh, my… I'll be old by then, Biboy.

254
00:19:53,292 --> 00:19:55,494
That's all right.
You'd still be beautiful.

255
00:19:55,561 --> 00:19:56,461
Oh, my.

256
00:19:56,528 --> 00:19:59,932
Biboy, if you want Doc Maxine
to say yes to you,

257
00:19:59,998 --> 00:20:01,600
don't be a soldier.

258
00:20:02,134 --> 00:20:04,069
Be an accountant instead.

259
00:20:04,636 --> 00:20:06,405
What's an accountant?

260
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:19,952
Let's start the transport.

261
00:20:31,763 --> 00:20:33,899
-It should be here, right?
-I'll do it.

262
00:20:37,636 --> 00:20:39,171
Talledo, is that heavy?

263
00:20:39,972 --> 00:20:41,306
No, ma'am. It's not a problem.

264
00:20:41,373 --> 00:20:43,275
Give that to Sergeant Ramos.

265
00:20:44,009 --> 00:20:45,110
Carry this instead.

266
00:20:52,517 --> 00:20:54,086
Yes, ma'am.

267
00:22:12,864 --> 00:22:14,199
It's hot.

268
00:22:17,636 --> 00:22:20,339
Hey, everyone!
The medical mission team is here!

269
00:22:20,439 --> 00:22:22,341
-Oh, they're here.
-Good morning.

270
00:22:24,076 --> 00:22:27,579
-They're here.
-Oh, they're here. That's good.

271
00:22:29,981 --> 00:22:33,285
-Good morning.
-Have you guys eaten already?

272
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:36,388
-I did, but I don't think you…
-We haven't.

273
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:38,390
We're okay.

274
00:22:38,924 --> 00:22:42,494
Hurry! Come on.

275
00:22:42,561 --> 00:22:44,830
-Okay.
-Hurry…

276
00:22:44,896 --> 00:22:46,665
-Let's go.
-There. Hurry.

277
00:23:27,105 --> 00:23:28,940
The plan will push through.

278
00:23:55,367 --> 00:24:00,939
You will execute your plans
when half of our troops have evacuated?

279
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:02,707
We don't have enough people.

280
00:24:03,508 --> 00:24:05,110
There's only a few of them left.

281
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:07,679
We can handle them.

282
00:24:08,413 --> 00:24:10,348
If the military has Special Forces,

283
00:24:11,883 --> 00:24:14,519
the PRG has an Elite Team.

284
00:24:16,388 --> 00:24:17,989
So, they better be ready.

285
00:24:26,932 --> 00:24:27,999
Everything all right?

286
00:24:29,701 --> 00:24:32,704
-Thanks for all the help.
-Don't mention it, Captain.

287
00:24:32,771 --> 00:24:34,906
-We have a lot to drink there.
-Sure.

288
00:24:34,973 --> 00:24:36,741
Thank you.

289
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:39,911
Give them something to drink.

290
00:24:39,978 --> 00:24:43,215
-Do you want some water?
-Give him water!

291
00:26:27,319 --> 00:26:29,321
Get out! Where do you think you're going?

292
00:26:31,623 --> 00:26:32,691
They're on their way.

293
00:26:32,757 --> 00:26:35,961
Secure the medical team, the civilians,
and Fayad's escorts as well.

294
00:26:52,043 --> 00:26:54,546
Surrender now!
We know you have a fake hostage.

295
00:26:54,613 --> 00:26:56,147
Just promise that you won't hurt us.

296
00:27:03,588 --> 00:27:05,290
Just let him go.
