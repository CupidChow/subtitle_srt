1
00:00:11,244 --> 00:00:13,613
Our asset doesn't know Greg.

2
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:15,348
But he provided information about PRG.

3
00:00:15,415 --> 00:00:17,617
They are scheduled
to return to Sitio Santos

4
00:00:17,684 --> 00:00:19,619
and they are asking money
from the residents.

5
00:00:19,686 --> 00:00:21,354
We can catch them in the act.

6
00:00:21,421 --> 00:00:23,256
We will block their operations.

7
00:00:23,323 --> 00:00:24,824
-<i>What is it?</i>
-It hurts, Rodel.

8
00:00:24,891 --> 00:00:26,593
-Bring me to a doctor.
-I can't take you there.

9
00:00:26,659 --> 00:00:27,527
It's too dangerous.

10
00:00:27,594 --> 00:00:29,929
Take your Madame Janet to a healer.

11
00:00:29,996 --> 00:00:31,631
This is the hideout
mentioned by our asset.

12
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:32,966
There are no other options.

13
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:34,601
We have to be careful.

14
00:00:34,667 --> 00:00:36,669
Make sure there will be
no civilians involved.

15
00:00:36,736 --> 00:00:39,139
Oh, my god! You're bleeding.

16
00:00:40,507 --> 00:00:42,075
Please, bring me to the doctor.

17
00:00:42,142 --> 00:00:44,577
I'll bring her to the Medicube.

18
00:00:44,644 --> 00:00:45,478
What?

19
00:00:45,545 --> 00:00:47,180
Janet is missing.

20
00:00:48,014 --> 00:00:50,183
I'm going with you. I'll look for my wife.

21
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:52,619
We've been here for a while
but there's no sign of PRG yet.

22
00:00:53,186 --> 00:00:55,789
What if they got a tip
that there are soldiers here?

23
00:00:56,256 --> 00:00:57,090
Janet?

24
00:00:57,290 --> 00:00:59,259
I don't think
who you're looking for is here.

25
00:00:59,325 --> 00:01:00,293
Will you shoot me?

26
00:01:00,493 --> 00:01:02,228
Let's cut to the chase.
You're not a civilian.

27
00:01:08,835 --> 00:01:09,669
Enemies!

28
00:01:13,706 --> 00:01:14,974
What can you say, Bullet?

29
00:01:15,375 --> 00:01:18,545
This is the end of the
Special Forces Team that they brag about.

30
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:26,619
Wolf, this is Big Boss. Come in.

31
00:01:27,187 --> 00:01:28,021
Big Boss.

32
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:29,923
We're at nine o'clock.
What's your position?

33
00:01:41,601 --> 00:01:42,836
Big Boss is here.

34
00:01:42,902 --> 00:01:45,371
-Snoopy, can you still make it?
-Yes.

35
00:01:46,039 --> 00:01:47,874
Come on, let's end this!

36
00:01:58,451 --> 00:01:59,652
Damn it!

37
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:03,723
If only I'm not injured,
Manalo would be dead by now.

38
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:05,158
We need to go.

39
00:02:05,225 --> 00:02:06,292
We're no longer safe here.

40
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:08,128
For sure they'll sweep the perimeter.

41
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:09,696
Let's go,

42
00:02:11,431 --> 00:02:12,832
Big Boss is coming in.

43
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:22,976
Big Boss, Snoopy is wounded.

44
00:02:45,031 --> 00:02:47,066
Sir… we were ambushed.

45
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,469
Our asset is a double agent.

46
00:02:50,103 --> 00:02:52,972
I expect a full report
from you about the encounter.

47
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:56,476
In the meantime,
I'll send reinforcements in Sitio Santos.

48
00:02:57,143 --> 00:02:58,278
Head back to the camp.

49
00:03:08,121 --> 00:03:10,156
Your blood pressure is high.

50
00:03:10,223 --> 00:03:14,427
According to your test results,
the protein count in your urine is high.

51
00:03:15,128 --> 00:03:17,197
What does that mean, Doc?

52
00:03:19,065 --> 00:03:20,733
These are signs of preeclampsia.

53
00:03:23,269 --> 00:03:27,273
It can put you and your baby in danger.

54
00:03:29,309 --> 00:03:30,143
What?

55
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:36,149
But don't worry, we'll take care
of you here in the hospital.

56
00:03:36,516 --> 00:03:38,318
But you have to stay here,

57
00:03:38,685 --> 00:03:42,488
so we can monitor your vitals
and the condition of your baby.

58
00:03:43,523 --> 00:03:44,357
Okay?

59
00:03:44,524 --> 00:03:46,926
Take care of yourself for your baby.

60
00:03:47,493 --> 00:03:50,930
What's important
is we already know your condition.

61
00:03:52,398 --> 00:03:56,736
Now, we can take care of you
and help deliver your baby safely, okay?

62
00:03:57,503 --> 00:03:59,239
Thank you very much, Doc.

63
00:04:01,341 --> 00:04:03,610
What's your name again, Doc?

64
00:04:45,551 --> 00:04:47,987
What's your name again, Doc?

65
00:04:48,588 --> 00:04:50,556
She is Doc Beauty.

66
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:52,325
That's what we call her here.

67
00:04:52,425 --> 00:04:54,894
Oh… Biboy. That's so sweet of you.

68
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:56,462
The name suits you, Doc.

69
00:04:56,529 --> 00:04:58,798
You're not only beautiful, but also kind.

70
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:00,433
Thank you.

71
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:01,834
You're welcome.

72
00:05:01,901 --> 00:05:06,773
I won't argue with a pregnant lady,
but you should rest well.

73
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:09,776
If you need anything
just let us know, okay?

74
00:05:37,603 --> 00:05:38,438
Sergeant Diego?

75
00:05:38,538 --> 00:05:39,939
He got shot in the shoulder.

76
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:41,107
The bullet is still inside.

77
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:43,142
Nurse Via,
kindly check his vital signs, please.

78
00:05:43,209 --> 00:05:44,677
Nurse Hazel, please help her.

79
00:05:44,744 --> 00:05:48,715
Dr. Ralph, please assess the entry
and exit wounds.

80
00:05:56,322 --> 00:05:57,890
Kindly check his vital signs.

81
00:05:58,091 --> 00:06:00,960
Nurse Hazel, where's the gauze?
Bring me some gauze.

82
00:06:01,427 --> 00:06:03,763
Dr. Ralph, please check
for the exit wound.

83
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:52,879
Was he given an anti-tetanus shot already?

84
00:06:52,945 --> 00:06:54,213
Anti-tetanus.

85
00:06:58,317 --> 00:06:59,185
How is he?

86
00:07:00,453 --> 00:07:01,988
Okay, steady.

87
00:07:05,825 --> 00:07:09,262
Let's check if we need to do
skin test for the anti-tetanus.

88
00:07:17,804 --> 00:07:19,005
They're resting already.

89
00:07:25,178 --> 00:07:26,446
Don't worry.

90
00:07:28,815 --> 00:07:29,982
Your men are strong…

91
00:07:31,317 --> 00:07:32,752
just like their trainer.

92
00:07:33,386 --> 00:07:35,455
Their trainer who almost got them killed.

93
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:39,992
Captain Manalo and I knew that
something was wrong with the operation.

94
00:07:41,427 --> 00:07:42,862
We shouldn't have left them.

95
00:07:45,097 --> 00:07:46,399
They could've fought back,

96
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:49,402
and wouldn't get hurt.

97
00:07:52,705 --> 00:07:53,573
It was me.

98
00:07:56,943 --> 00:07:57,810
This is my fault.

99
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:56,202
Snoopy, how's your situation?

100
00:08:56,269 --> 00:08:58,237
<i>Big Boss, there are PRG rebels outside.</i>

101
00:08:58,304 --> 00:08:59,138
<i>We're being ambushed.</i>

102
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:25,665
Thank you.

103
00:09:33,139 --> 00:09:34,040
I didn't get shot.

104
00:09:35,474 --> 00:09:36,576
I'm not wounded.

105
00:09:38,144 --> 00:09:39,278
That's good to know.

106
00:09:43,716 --> 00:09:44,550
Why is that?

107
00:09:45,384 --> 00:09:47,653
Are you worried about me?

108
00:09:50,156 --> 00:09:51,157
Yes, of course.

109
00:09:52,692 --> 00:09:54,727
I saw your team wounded.

110
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:59,799
When you arrived, I saw them wounded.

111
00:10:02,735 --> 00:10:04,270
I got scared for you.

112
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:10,142
But when I saw you that you seem okay,

113
00:10:13,913 --> 00:10:15,615
it felt like a thorn off my chest.

114
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:18,284
Maxine…

115
00:10:19,719 --> 00:10:21,887
Lucas, that made me realize

116
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:26,659
that I can't stand that kind of life,

117
00:10:27,927 --> 00:10:34,300
where I am always worried and scared.

118
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:41,907
You said you'll wait for my next move.

119
00:10:49,181 --> 00:10:50,016
This is it.

120
00:11:21,914 --> 00:11:24,283
Is that food? For whom?

121
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,722
Let's have lunch together later.

122
00:11:30,956 --> 00:11:32,725
I'll wait for you in the mess hall.

123
00:11:34,927 --> 00:11:37,163
You patched things up?

124
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:39,432
You got back together?

125
00:11:39,732 --> 00:11:40,566
Since when?

126
00:11:41,067 --> 00:11:41,967
How?

127
00:11:48,074 --> 00:11:49,008
Just last night.

128
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,077
And it's a secret.

129
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:55,481
Good for them, while I…

130
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:58,584
Why?

131
00:11:58,851 --> 00:12:00,252
Dr. Maxine turned you down?

132
00:12:02,121 --> 00:12:03,723
Do you want to do 100 push-ups?

133
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:12,431
Wow.

134
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:18,237
You have to eat well,

135
00:12:18,304 --> 00:12:21,273
because we can't give medicine
for your condition.

136
00:12:22,274 --> 00:12:26,378
We'll have to wait for the right time
for you to give birth.

137
00:12:28,547 --> 00:12:31,250
Do I need to stay here
in the hospital, Doc?

138
00:12:31,817 --> 00:12:36,889
Yes, so we can properly monitor
your vitals and that of your child.

139
00:12:39,859 --> 00:12:42,161
Is there someone you need to call?

140
00:12:42,828 --> 00:12:44,430
Your family or your husband?

141
00:12:45,064 --> 00:12:47,900
We can have them picked up
so they can accompany you.

142
00:12:47,967 --> 00:12:48,834
No need, Doc.

143
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:50,436
It's okay.

144
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:07,853
You go ahead.

145
00:13:13,826 --> 00:13:15,628
It looks like you need it, Big Boss.

146
00:13:59,972 --> 00:14:01,106
Rodel.

147
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:05,611
I'm here in the Medicube.

148
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:07,213
I knew it!

149
00:14:08,047 --> 00:14:09,849
Did you know that I looked
for you everywhere?

150
00:14:09,915 --> 00:14:13,252
You're stubborn.
I told you not to go there!

151
00:14:13,652 --> 00:14:17,489
I did this for our child,
for the baby's safety!

152
00:14:17,556 --> 00:14:19,558
Do you know
that you're in the enemy's territory?

153
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:21,026
<i>What if they find out about you?</i>

154
00:14:21,093 --> 00:14:23,229
No one will suspect me.

155
00:14:23,295 --> 00:14:25,231
No one will arrest me here.

156
00:14:27,499 --> 00:14:28,434
Madame…

157
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:33,072
Are you okay?

158
00:14:33,572 --> 00:14:34,940
Is there a problem?

159
00:14:42,681 --> 00:14:43,515
Who is that?

160
00:14:45,517 --> 00:14:46,619
Janet, who is that?

161
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:49,822
Nothing.

162
00:14:50,422 --> 00:14:51,457
Nothing, sir.

163
00:14:58,163 --> 00:14:59,832
Sir, I'm just looking for my wife.

164
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:01,500
She's pregnant. She needs me.

165
00:15:02,868 --> 00:15:06,372
You are from Sitio Santos, right?

166
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:09,441
Are you from there?

167
00:15:10,109 --> 00:15:14,413
I think it's my first time
to see you here.

168
00:15:17,349 --> 00:15:19,585
By the way, I'm Captain Lucas.

169
00:15:21,687 --> 00:15:22,788
What is your name?

170
00:15:26,225 --> 00:15:27,092
Madame?

171
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:35,901
We're going to the Medicube.

172
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:40,806
Wait…

173
00:15:43,742 --> 00:15:45,878
-What happened?
-What if they find out who Janet is?

174
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:48,113
Something bad might happen to her!
We have to rescue her!

175
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:49,581
Rodel….

176
00:15:49,648 --> 00:15:52,318
The madame won't say anything
that will put her in harm's way.

177
00:15:53,385 --> 00:15:55,921
Besides, soldiers will
never hurt a pregnant woman.

178
00:15:57,089 --> 00:15:57,923
One more thing,

179
00:15:59,325 --> 00:16:01,660
we lack men out here.

180
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:07,800
If we attack the military camp,
we will be dead for sure.

181
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:16,475
Damn it!

182
00:16:16,842 --> 00:16:19,511
Madame, are you okay?

183
00:16:20,245 --> 00:16:23,415
Yes, sir. I'm okay.

184
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:26,785
I'm not from Sitio Santos.

185
00:16:27,686 --> 00:16:31,423
I'm from the next village, sir.

186
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:34,093
There's are no midwives there.

187
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:37,529
So, that's why.

188
00:16:38,931 --> 00:16:41,867
Don't you have someone with you?

189
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:47,473
How about your husband?
Is he not with you?

190
00:16:47,539 --> 00:16:50,242
He's not here, sir.

191
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:53,345
I came here on an emergency.

192
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:56,548
We can ask someone to pick him up.

193
00:16:56,615 --> 00:16:58,083
No need, sir.

194
00:16:58,317 --> 00:17:00,252
I spoke to him already.

195
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:02,888
Lucas?

196
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:06,458
What are you doing with my patient?

197
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:07,626
We were talking.

198
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:11,363
Are you okay?

199
00:17:15,234 --> 00:17:17,469
You shouldn't stress her out.

200
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:20,839
It's bad for her and her baby, okay?

201
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:22,374
Okay.

202
00:17:23,108 --> 00:17:24,410
Let's step outside, okay?

203
00:17:40,626 --> 00:17:42,928
What were you doing inside
my patient's room?

204
00:17:43,028 --> 00:17:44,363
Why is she so scared of you?

205
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:45,664
I'm just asking her something.

206
00:17:45,764 --> 00:17:46,632
What?

207
00:17:49,368 --> 00:17:52,204
Okay, I have a suspicion.

208
00:17:52,671 --> 00:17:53,872
I just want to confirm it.

209
00:17:53,939 --> 00:17:54,873
That's why you're harassing her?

210
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:57,242
I was not harassing her.
I was just talking to her.

211
00:17:57,309 --> 00:18:00,012
From now on, you're not allowed
to come near her.

212
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:03,515
What? I'm in charge here of the camp.
You can't tell me what to do.

213
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:04,950
I am in charge of the Medicube.

214
00:18:05,017 --> 00:18:06,718
Her pregnancy is delicate, Lucas.

215
00:18:06,852 --> 00:18:08,120
Her blood pressure can't go up

216
00:18:08,187 --> 00:18:10,155
or else she and her baby
will be in danger.

217
00:18:10,289 --> 00:18:12,624
I won't put them in danger, Maxine.

218
00:18:13,192 --> 00:18:14,726
I will just talk to her.

219
00:18:14,793 --> 00:18:17,696
Understand the gravity
of the situation here, okay?

220
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:20,132
You don't understand me, Lucas.

221
00:18:20,232 --> 00:18:24,036
She came here as a patient
because she need medical help.

222
00:18:24,203 --> 00:18:25,704
She needs to be taken care of.

223
00:18:26,004 --> 00:18:29,074
She didn't come here as a rebel
or whatever you're thinking.

224
00:18:30,509 --> 00:18:32,244
Capt. Lucas, Dr. Maxine.

225
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:35,414
You are needed inside. Hurry!

226
00:18:40,586 --> 00:18:43,222
I had the whole Medicube checked
before I called you,

227
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:44,623
but she's really gone.

228
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:48,827
We don't have a CCTV
so we won't know what happened.

229
00:19:01,273 --> 00:19:03,342
She probably went far already.

230
00:19:04,076 --> 00:19:06,512
There are many paths out of this camp.

231
00:19:10,349 --> 00:19:13,785
Why do you look at me that way?
Are you blaming me?

232
00:19:13,852 --> 00:19:16,522
She left because you scared her off.

233
00:19:16,588 --> 00:19:19,424
I'm sorry, that's not my intention.

234
00:19:21,393 --> 00:19:22,594
She is hiding something.

235
00:19:22,661 --> 00:19:25,998
You're still thinking about that?

236
00:19:26,064 --> 00:19:27,599
So, why did she…

237
00:19:29,635 --> 00:19:30,469
Sir?

238
00:19:30,536 --> 00:19:32,704
Manalo, where are you?

239
00:19:39,645 --> 00:19:41,547
Moira, I leave you in charge.

240
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:54,993
Sir, I highly recommend
we reinforce security in the camp.

241
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:59,298
There is a suspected PRG member
who entered the Medicube.

242
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:04,336
-Where is she?
-She escaped before we could identify her.

243
00:20:04,403 --> 00:20:07,306
Okay, I'll send reinforcement to the camp.

244
00:20:07,372 --> 00:20:10,842
Then, we'll start debriefing
about the encounter yesterday.

245
00:20:13,845 --> 00:20:17,783
There will be no outside communications
until we settle this.

246
00:20:41,707 --> 00:20:44,376
We only have Janet's first name.

247
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:48,046
She was in pain when she was brought
to the emergency room.

248
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:50,682
So, we let her rest first.

249
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:55,354
Doc, it seems there's no way
for us to find the patient.

250
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:56,555
That's unacceptable.

251
00:20:56,622 --> 00:20:58,657
Janet and her baby
are in a delicate condition.

252
00:20:58,724 --> 00:21:01,226
She needs to be monitored
until she gives birth.

253
00:21:01,293 --> 00:21:03,028
We can't do that if she's not here.

254
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:04,830
How can we find her?

255
00:21:04,896 --> 00:21:07,766
We don't even have her last name.
What more her address?

256
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:16,775
Doc Beauty, how is Miss Janet?

257
00:21:27,986 --> 00:21:30,422
Good thing you escaped from the Medicube.

258
00:21:30,489 --> 00:21:32,824
It's a military camp!
You know it's dangerous there.

259
00:21:33,492 --> 00:21:35,527
Our child's life is at a greater risk.

260
00:21:37,696 --> 00:21:39,531
My pregnancy is delicate.

261
00:21:40,565 --> 00:21:43,001
I need a doctor, I need a hospital…

262
00:21:44,036 --> 00:21:48,273
or else we might lose our child!

263
00:21:51,376 --> 00:21:53,745
I also don't want to lose our baby.

264
00:21:54,746 --> 00:21:56,715
But can't you understand?

265
00:21:56,848 --> 00:21:58,517
The military is hunting us down.

266
00:21:59,718 --> 00:22:02,220
There was an encounter
last night in Sitio Santos.

267
00:22:03,622 --> 00:22:06,558
We planned to ambush
the Special Forces but it failed.

268
00:22:07,793 --> 00:22:08,860
Rodel, please.

269
00:22:09,761 --> 00:22:10,862
Janet…

270
00:22:13,632 --> 00:22:16,968
I don't want you and our baby
in the military camp.

271
00:22:17,803 --> 00:22:19,705
Who knows what they can do to you

272
00:22:19,771 --> 00:22:22,074
once they find out
how important you are to me.

273
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:27,245
If what you're saying is true,
you should prioritize me and your child.

274
00:22:27,312 --> 00:22:30,449
Forget your plans
against the Special Forces.

275
00:22:30,515 --> 00:22:32,217
Let's get out of this place!

276
00:22:45,964 --> 00:22:47,799
We can't contact the asset anymore, sir.

277
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:49,601
He probably went into hiding.

278
00:22:49,668 --> 00:22:51,770
We still have to find the asset.

279
00:22:51,837 --> 00:22:53,071
If he is a double agent,

280
00:22:53,538 --> 00:22:55,207
I'm sure he has connections
to the enemies.

281
00:22:56,241 --> 00:22:59,444
He can point us
to the other members of PRG.

282
00:22:59,511 --> 00:23:01,079
I'll assign a person for that.

283
00:23:02,614 --> 00:23:06,785
Sir, I believe I've encountered
the leader of PRG in Urdan last night.

284
00:23:09,788 --> 00:23:13,358
I couldn't see his face because he escaped
in the middle of the gunfire.

285
00:23:13,692 --> 00:23:15,260
But I have reason to believe

286
00:23:15,327 --> 00:23:18,864
that the woman in the Medicube
has connections with him.

287
00:23:19,664 --> 00:23:21,500
The woman you allowed to escape.

288
00:23:23,068 --> 00:23:25,437
Doc, are you sure
about what you're going to do?

289
00:23:25,604 --> 00:23:27,305
It's too dangerous.

290
00:23:27,372 --> 00:23:29,541
Earl and Ralph are with me.

291
00:23:29,941 --> 00:23:31,743
You can take care of matters here.

292
00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:33,378
Anyway, Captain Moira is here.

293
00:23:33,712 --> 00:23:37,816
Should we wait first
for Captain Lucas before you go?

294
00:23:37,883 --> 00:23:39,484
We don't need to wait for them.

295
00:23:39,551 --> 00:23:41,586
I'm the highest officer here.

296
00:23:41,653 --> 00:23:44,623
It means I'm in charge
in the absence of Captain Manalo.

297
00:23:44,823 --> 00:23:45,991
And I forbid you to leave.

298
00:23:46,057 --> 00:23:48,927
Captain Moira, you are also a doctor.

299
00:23:48,994 --> 00:23:51,863
If you are in my situation,
you will also do the same.

300
00:23:52,063 --> 00:23:53,265
I'm not just a doctor.

301
00:23:53,398 --> 00:23:54,766
I'm a military doctor.

302
00:23:54,933 --> 00:23:58,870
It means I follow the rules
and orders of my superiors.

303
00:23:58,937 --> 00:24:00,005
I'm not a soldier,

304
00:24:00,405 --> 00:24:02,707
that's why I don't need
to follow your orders.

305
00:24:02,774 --> 00:24:04,943
Ma'am, Doc,

306
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:09,281
maybe we need to contact Big Boss
so he knows about your plans.

307
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:12,317
Call him.

308
00:24:30,502 --> 00:24:32,904
Sir, what happened
is not Captain Manalo's fault, sir.

309
00:24:34,739 --> 00:24:36,141
Who do you want me to blame?

310
00:24:36,208 --> 00:24:38,043
-Eugenio…
-You?

311
00:24:38,109 --> 00:24:40,245
Captain Manalo just did his job, sir.

312
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:44,382
He talked to the woman
but Doctor Dela Cruz stopped him,

313
00:24:44,449 --> 00:24:45,617
that's why she escaped.

314
00:24:45,817 --> 00:24:47,552
It's Doctor Dela Cruz again.

315
00:24:56,695 --> 00:25:01,099
Marty, you're delaying us
by contacting him.

316
00:25:01,266 --> 00:25:03,602
We need to leave
so we can get back right away.

317
00:25:04,436 --> 00:25:05,537
Right, Captain Moira?

318
00:25:10,008 --> 00:25:11,042
Let's go.

319
00:25:11,109 --> 00:25:12,811
Biboy, take care of us.

320
00:25:12,978 --> 00:25:14,980
-No problem, Doc Beauty.
-Let's go.

321
00:25:15,046 --> 00:25:16,948
-Doc, be careful.
-Take care of matters here.

322
00:25:17,582 --> 00:25:18,583
Be careful.

323
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:31,463
Escort them. Come back safely.

324
00:25:37,836 --> 00:25:39,037
Is it still far?

325
00:25:39,204 --> 00:25:40,038
Yes, a bit.

326
00:25:42,974 --> 00:25:45,677
You didn't tell us
we'll go hiking, Maxine.

327
00:25:46,444 --> 00:25:47,779
Okay, sorry.

328
00:25:48,346 --> 00:25:51,449
If I requested for a car,
they won't allow us to go out.

329
00:25:52,484 --> 00:25:53,518
Don't you like this?

330
00:25:53,618 --> 00:25:56,488
You get to exercise
and have fresh air at the same time.

331
00:25:56,555 --> 00:25:59,057
-You have a point.
-Stop complaining.

332
00:25:59,291 --> 00:26:01,426
You can rest when you get back.

333
00:26:01,493 --> 00:26:02,460
As for me,

334
00:26:03,161 --> 00:26:05,530
for sure Big Boss
will give me some punishment.

335
00:26:05,597 --> 00:26:07,966
Don't worry. I got your back.

336
00:26:08,033 --> 00:26:09,501
I'll talk to Lucas about it.

337
00:26:09,901 --> 00:26:13,204
Do you still have a hold on Big Boss
when you rejected him already?

338
00:26:13,271 --> 00:26:14,105
What?

339
00:26:17,442 --> 00:26:18,577
How did you know?

340
00:26:19,244 --> 00:26:22,047
Doc, how did you turn him down?

341
00:26:23,481 --> 00:26:24,583
What happened?

342
00:26:24,649 --> 00:26:27,052
I pity the Captain.

343
00:26:29,821 --> 00:26:30,655
Let's go.

344
00:26:32,123 --> 00:26:33,058
Come on, let's go.

345
00:26:34,059 --> 00:26:35,760
The Captain got rejected.

346
00:26:35,827 --> 00:26:36,828
Gossips.

347
00:26:36,895 --> 00:26:41,333
We've encountered these people
several times in Urdan.

348
00:26:44,803 --> 00:26:46,871
It's obvious our enemies are outnumbered.

349
00:26:46,938 --> 00:26:48,306
And according to Captain,

350
00:26:49,474 --> 00:26:50,709
their leader is injured.

351
00:26:51,943 --> 00:26:53,979
Let's not wait for them to recover.

352
00:26:54,045 --> 00:26:57,048
Are you saying you want
to attack the PRG Camp?

353
00:26:58,383 --> 00:26:59,851
How are you going to do that?

354
00:26:59,985 --> 00:27:02,220
Your men are also injured, Manalo?

355
00:27:02,887 --> 00:27:05,624
That's why they won't be expecting
our attack, sir.

356
00:27:06,891 --> 00:27:10,261
They'll think we're still resting
and regaining our strength.

357
00:27:10,895 --> 00:27:11,997
But we're ready, sir.

358
00:27:12,397 --> 00:27:14,065
Our team is strong.

359
00:27:14,966 --> 00:27:17,068
This is really our mission here in Urdan.

360
00:27:17,135 --> 00:27:18,770
It's best if we'll end it now.

361
00:27:22,374 --> 00:27:24,009
We'll attack their camp.

362
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:29,014
They're no match for us, sir.

363
00:27:59,611 --> 00:28:00,879
Somebody's coming.

364
00:28:02,547 --> 00:28:04,749
It looks like we have VIP visitors.

365
00:28:04,816 --> 00:28:06,017
Just stay there!

366
00:28:07,118 --> 00:28:07,952
Marty!

367
00:28:08,019 --> 00:28:09,988
He went directly to the Medicube.
He's looking for you.

368
00:28:10,055 --> 00:28:12,323
-Biboy?
-Doc Beauty was kidnapped.

369
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:13,658
You shouldn't have come.

370
00:28:13,725 --> 00:28:15,894
I ordered Talledo to escort them.

371
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:17,996
He's not yet ready
for situations like that.

372
00:28:18,063 --> 00:28:20,265
He got in trouble because of me.

373
00:28:20,331 --> 00:28:22,567
Let's just trust him and Dr. Dela Cruz.

374
00:28:22,634 --> 00:28:24,002
We will save them.

375
00:28:26,738 --> 00:28:28,807
I asked the assistance
of the Air Force and the Navy

376
00:28:28,873 --> 00:28:31,009
for air and water surveillance
of the PRG Camp.

377
00:28:42,053 --> 00:28:44,122
I fell in my trap, Captain Manalo.

378
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:45,390
Put your guns down.

379
00:28:48,293 --> 00:28:50,095
I'm not afraid to die.

380
00:28:52,097 --> 00:28:53,431
How about you?
