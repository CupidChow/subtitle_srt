1
00:00:11,244 --> 00:00:14,948
I want to let you know that your request
to be reassigned has been granted,

2
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:16,249
to the town of Urdan,

3
00:00:16,316 --> 00:00:18,852
<i>the center of gravity</i>
<i>where the PRG is hiding.</i>

4
00:00:24,224 --> 00:00:26,026
<i>How's our dad?</i>

5
00:00:26,092 --> 00:00:28,028
<i>Don't worry. He's in stable condition.</i>

6
00:00:28,094 --> 00:00:29,129
Thank you, Doc.

7
00:00:29,195 --> 00:00:32,132
<i>He's not my boyfriend yet.</i>
<i>Just relax, Mom.</i>

8
00:00:32,198 --> 00:00:36,336
If he professes his love to me,
I won't hesitate.

9
00:00:36,403 --> 00:00:39,672
-Your brother is at work?
-Yes, he's at the camp.

10
00:00:39,739 --> 00:00:40,907
In Camp Aguinaldo.

11
00:00:40,974 --> 00:00:42,108
He's the Captain

12
00:00:42,175 --> 00:00:45,378
of the First Special Forces
of the Philippine Army.

13
00:00:45,445 --> 00:00:47,814
I thought you were different
from the other men I've met.

14
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:49,416
But you're all the same.

15
00:00:49,482 --> 00:00:51,284
Whatever it is between us,

16
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:52,619
let's just end it.

17
00:00:52,685 --> 00:00:54,154
If that's what you want…

18
00:00:55,021 --> 00:00:56,756
there's nothing else I can do.

19
00:01:08,334 --> 00:01:10,503
Always take care of yourself.

20
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:18,932
Maxine!

21
00:03:18,998 --> 00:03:21,301
Is Lucas your boyfriend already?

22
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:23,469
Did you say yes to him yet?

23
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:29,309
I'm happy you got a boyfriend
before I fly back to New York.

24
00:03:29,909 --> 00:03:31,277
I'm really excited.

25
00:03:35,248 --> 00:03:36,649
What?

26
00:03:38,251 --> 00:03:40,753
He has been lying to me all this time.

27
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:45,725
Is there a third party?

28
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:47,627
He is not an accountant.

29
00:03:48,361 --> 00:03:50,597
He's a soldier. He lied.

30
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:54,634
What? That's it?

31
00:03:56,035 --> 00:03:59,772
He lied to me this early.
What more if we become a couple?

32
00:04:08,548 --> 00:04:10,283
I thought you went on a date.

33
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:11,818
Why does it look like…

34
00:04:12,652 --> 00:04:15,221
you came from a wake?

35
00:04:19,192 --> 00:04:20,360
She broke up with me.

36
00:04:21,961 --> 00:04:24,697
You're not even together yet
but she broke up with you already?

37
00:04:26,299 --> 00:04:27,734
That's the thing.

38
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:33,239
I really didn't want to lie to her, but…

39
00:04:35,708 --> 00:04:37,910
I just wanted to get closer to her.

40
00:04:39,979 --> 00:04:42,048
She didn't even listen to me.

41
00:04:42,849 --> 00:04:45,618
I gave him an opportunity.

42
00:04:45,685 --> 00:04:49,922
I gave him and also myself a chance…

43
00:04:50,657 --> 00:04:54,160
to love again, and this is what happens?
How could he do that?

44
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:03,403
I know the answer to that.

45
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:05,071
See her again.

46
00:05:06,005 --> 00:05:08,875
Who knows? Maybe tomorrow,
she's no longer mad at you.

47
00:05:10,743 --> 00:05:11,644
No need.

48
00:05:11,711 --> 00:05:13,713
If she doesn't want to, then so be it.

49
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:15,982
Right?

50
00:05:16,582 --> 00:05:18,351
Nobody's perfect.

51
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:21,754
Everyone makes mistakes, even us.

52
00:05:28,094 --> 00:05:29,295
I don't want that.

53
00:05:29,362 --> 00:05:33,299
I can't take that, Mom.
I don't want to be left behind.

54
00:05:33,366 --> 00:05:35,668
If that's what she thinks about me,

55
00:05:35,735 --> 00:05:41,341
whatever I say or do,
nothing can change her mind.

56
00:05:43,643 --> 00:05:45,378
It's for the best.

57
00:05:48,381 --> 00:05:51,818
I can concentrate on our mission in Urdan.

58
00:05:51,884 --> 00:05:52,985
That's it.

59
00:05:53,619 --> 00:05:55,088
If she doesn't want to, then so be it.

60
00:05:55,788 --> 00:05:59,992
If he really loves me
and respects whatever we had…

61
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:02,862
he shouldn't have lied.

62
00:06:02,929 --> 00:06:06,065
Love really is a gamble.

63
00:06:06,966 --> 00:06:09,335
There are men who will break your heart,

64
00:06:09,402 --> 00:06:13,072
but there are also men
who are trustworthy.

65
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:16,142
But don't stop searching, okay?

66
00:06:33,793 --> 00:06:37,864
There's no jackpot in love,
so just keep betting.

67
00:07:00,286 --> 00:07:01,521
You'll get through this.

68
00:07:02,188 --> 00:07:04,957
You've lived through a gunshot wound,
a heartbreak is what?

69
00:07:05,658 --> 00:07:06,926
You can handle this.

70
00:07:09,829 --> 00:07:11,097
Remember that.

71
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:18,905
Okay, go on.

72
00:07:22,241 --> 00:07:24,076
-Dismissed? Really?
-Yes.

73
00:07:24,143 --> 00:07:25,745
You're dismissing me? The Big Boss?

74
00:07:25,812 --> 00:07:27,814
-Yes.
-Are you sure about that? Really?

75
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:31,184
-No.
-I thought so.

76
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:33,019
-Dismissed, huh?
-I'm going to clean my boots.

77
00:07:33,085 --> 00:07:36,088
Want me to clean anything for you?
Your bike, perhaps?

78
00:07:36,155 --> 00:07:38,624
Yes, I'll clean it for your next date.

79
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:42,695
-Even without a date.
-Even without a date?

80
00:07:42,762 --> 00:07:44,630
-Even without a date.
-But you'll still clean it.

81
00:07:44,697 --> 00:07:46,666
-Of course.
-Because you tried to dismiss me, right?

82
00:07:46,732 --> 00:07:47,667
Yes. I mean, no.

83
00:07:59,846 --> 00:08:04,517
Technical Sargent Diego Ramos,
please answer my call.

84
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:34,580
Hi.

85
00:08:36,883 --> 00:08:39,585
I had to speak to Congressman Jaime.

86
00:08:41,053 --> 00:08:43,656
I had reports to finish
while waiting for you.

87
00:08:43,723 --> 00:08:46,959
Tony should've had my car's brakes fixed.

88
00:08:47,693 --> 00:08:50,229
Thanks to Tony,
we now have time to catch up.

89
00:08:52,131 --> 00:08:54,734
Let's go. Crazy Spoon might close.

90
00:09:15,254 --> 00:09:17,924
No military issues discussions
over dinner, okay?

91
00:09:21,327 --> 00:09:22,628
I'll just load up.

92
00:09:23,296 --> 00:09:24,897
Me too. I'm starving.

93
00:09:35,608 --> 00:09:37,276
I just accidentally dialed it, Dad.

94
00:09:39,712 --> 00:09:43,282
Don't waste your time on him.
He has a mission in Urdan.

95
00:09:43,816 --> 00:09:44,984
That's his priority.

96
00:09:45,051 --> 00:09:47,019
He didn't even bother to tell me.

97
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:48,220
What was that?

98
00:09:51,824 --> 00:09:53,025
I'm just hungry.

99
00:10:05,137 --> 00:10:08,574
Mom, I'm sorry I can't take you
to the airport.

100
00:10:08,641 --> 00:10:11,744
I have surgery at 10:00 a.m.

101
00:10:11,811 --> 00:10:12,912
It's okay.

102
00:10:15,548 --> 00:10:17,717
Your patients need you more.

103
00:10:20,486 --> 00:10:24,156
Always remember, my line is open anytime.

104
00:10:24,223 --> 00:10:27,326
If you need anything, just call me.

105
00:10:33,366 --> 00:10:34,600
That's good.

106
00:10:35,234 --> 00:10:39,438
Keep me updated, okay?
I hope you go dating again.

107
00:10:39,505 --> 00:10:41,874
Who knows?
Maybe when I come back next year,

108
00:10:41,941 --> 00:10:43,643
it will already be for your wedding.

109
00:10:43,709 --> 00:10:45,511
Oh, my.

110
00:10:45,578 --> 00:10:47,013
You should get going, Mom.

111
00:10:47,079 --> 00:10:48,748
-All right.
-You might get stuck in traffic.

112
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:50,950
Let me know when you land in New York.

113
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:53,319
-Take care. Bye!
-You too, Mom.

114
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:56,622
-I love you.
-I love you. Be safe.

115
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,641
This is okay.

116
00:12:23,642 --> 00:12:26,112
You are all the same.

117
00:12:27,346 --> 00:12:30,750
Liars! Especially that Lucas.

118
00:12:33,052 --> 00:12:36,655
You know, if that orange was your person,

119
00:12:36,722 --> 00:12:38,357
he would have already flatlined.

120
00:12:39,692 --> 00:12:42,094
What a waste of an expensive fruit.

121
00:12:42,895 --> 00:12:43,996
Give that to me.

122
00:12:44,396 --> 00:12:48,334
Instead of picking on an innocent fruit,

123
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,736
why don't you just confront Lucas?

124
00:12:51,537 --> 00:12:52,671
No way!

125
00:12:53,372 --> 00:12:55,107
I don't want to see him ever again.

126
00:12:55,741 --> 00:12:58,377
Aren't you being too impulsive?

127
00:12:58,978 --> 00:13:01,847
Can't you at least let him explain

128
00:13:01,914 --> 00:13:06,552
why he lied to you about his real job?

129
00:13:07,086 --> 00:13:09,054
Sandra, I'm a simple person.

130
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:15,194
Is that so difficult?

131
00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:17,663
You know what, Maxine?

132
00:13:18,531 --> 00:13:20,399
I used to be just like you.

133
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:31,844
I've already made my decision.

134
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:34,313
It's over between me and Lucas.

135
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:50,830
I won't let you leave
without us talking first, Diego.

136
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,036
CAPTAIN MOIRA HAD AN ACCIDENT.
SHE'S AT ST. MARY'S HOSPITAL.

137
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:40,846
Sir, Moira got into an accident.
I need to go see her.

138
00:14:40,913 --> 00:14:43,282
-I'll come with you.
-No need, I can handle this.

139
00:14:43,349 --> 00:14:44,483
They need you here.

140
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:46,185
Okay.

141
00:14:46,252 --> 00:14:48,254
Give my regards to her,
and keep me updated.

142
00:14:49,688 --> 00:14:51,657
Be back by 1700 hours, can you do that?

143
00:15:08,274 --> 00:15:09,942
Why don't I visit Maxine too?

144
00:15:12,645 --> 00:15:17,283
No, Lucas. Just stay put.
Your mission in Urdan is more important.

145
00:15:19,084 --> 00:15:20,019
Just stay here.

146
00:15:50,716 --> 00:15:52,751
Please, Lucas. Stop bothering me.

147
00:15:53,552 --> 00:15:55,955
There is nothing you can do
to change my mind.

148
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:59,024
You lied to me
and made me look like a fool.

149
00:16:01,694 --> 00:16:03,529
Stay out of my life, please.

150
00:16:06,598 --> 00:16:07,599
Are you talking to me?

151
00:16:21,847 --> 00:16:22,881
I'm sorry.

152
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:42,601
You're waiting for someone.

153
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:43,969
It's Captain Lucas, right?

154
00:16:44,636 --> 00:16:45,671
Of course not.

155
00:16:46,605 --> 00:16:47,940
We're done, remember?

156
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:52,144
You didn't even give him a chance.
You just turned him down.

157
00:16:52,211 --> 00:16:54,513
Well, what's wrong with that?
I had the right to do that.

158
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:56,448
It was I who got played and got hurt.

159
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:58,384
If he's really serious about me,

160
00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:01,186
he wouldn't take no for an answer.
But where is he now? Nowhere, right?

161
00:17:01,253 --> 00:17:02,221
He gave up easily.

162
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:04,857
You know, I made the right decision.

163
00:17:07,993 --> 00:17:09,028
We are done.

164
00:17:10,062 --> 00:17:13,332
We're no longer together.
We were never a couple to begin with.

165
00:17:16,435 --> 00:17:18,470
I'm used to being alone.

166
00:17:19,505 --> 00:17:21,206
I really am.

167
00:17:22,007 --> 00:17:24,476
My world doesn't revolve around him.

168
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:41,927
Good afternoon.

169
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:48,434
Please give us a moment.

170
00:18:15,727 --> 00:18:17,729
I don't have the courage to face you yet.

171
00:18:20,466 --> 00:18:22,434
Someday, you will learn…

172
00:18:24,503 --> 00:18:25,604
the reason behind it.

173
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:36,542
BIG BOSS
WE'RE LEAVING IN AN HOUR. HURRY UP.

174
00:19:43,615 --> 00:19:45,117
Always take care of yourself.

175
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:48,453
Get well soon, Moira.

176
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:52,958
I love you so much.

177
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:56,195
I really do.

178
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:23,088
How is Moira?

179
00:20:24,323 --> 00:20:28,160
She's in a stable condition.
But we weren't able to talk before I left.

180
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:33,865
We'll be deployed for six months.
Are you sure you can do that?

181
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:37,636
-It's just a matter of getting used to.
-And we're used to it already.

182
00:20:39,004 --> 00:20:41,173
How about Doc Maxine?

183
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,641
Did you call her?

184
00:20:44,276 --> 00:20:45,210
No need.

185
00:20:46,011 --> 00:20:47,012
What for?

186
00:20:48,814 --> 00:20:50,449
I don't want to force it either.

187
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:53,619
If she doesn't like me, then…

188
00:20:54,353 --> 00:20:56,321
there's nothing we can do about it.

189
00:20:56,388 --> 00:20:57,289
Really?

190
00:20:58,790 --> 00:20:59,958
That's coming from you?

191
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:05,891
<i>Urdan is considered a terrorism hotspot.</i>

192
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:08,327
<i>Based on the intel report,</i>

193
00:22:08,393 --> 00:22:13,265
<i>this is the center of gravity</i>
<i>of the Philippine Revolutionary Group</i>

194
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:14,800
<i>that we've been hunting down.</i>

195
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:18,670
<i>The PRG recruits</i>
<i>from this area have been increasing.</i>

196
00:22:31,683 --> 00:22:36,188
-Watch out for the truck!
-Get out of the way!

197
00:22:40,058 --> 00:22:41,626
Are you okay?

198
00:22:41,693 --> 00:22:44,429
You should drive carefully.

199
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:48,467
Are you okay, miss?

200
00:22:49,368 --> 00:22:53,638
-We're okay.
-Are you hurt?

201
00:22:53,705 --> 00:22:55,540
-Are you all okay?
-We're okay.

202
00:22:55,607 --> 00:22:57,275
Did anyone get hurt?

203
00:22:57,342 --> 00:22:59,711
-We're all okay, sir.
-Everything is okay, sir.

204
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:04,049
Let's steer that way.

205
00:23:10,522 --> 00:23:13,458
-Thank you, sir.
-Be careful.

206
00:23:33,979 --> 00:23:35,747
Doctor, here's the file you asked for.

207
00:24:07,245 --> 00:24:08,780
Why are you smiling?

208
00:24:08,847 --> 00:24:10,615
What are you looking at?

209
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:13,652
Lucas' picture.

210
00:24:13,718 --> 00:24:16,054
Where? I don't see any picture there.

211
00:24:16,721 --> 00:24:17,989
There it is.

212
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:22,093
That's the only picture of him
that I have.

213
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:22,994
Where?

214
00:24:24,529 --> 00:24:25,630
That?

215
00:24:26,965 --> 00:24:29,468
My friend is losing it.

216
00:25:44,009 --> 00:25:46,511
Thank you for coming,
things are getting really tense here.

217
00:25:46,578 --> 00:25:47,479
He is Jimmy.

218
00:25:47,546 --> 00:25:51,616
He will be your asset in the PRG.
He's dependable and skilled.

219
00:25:51,683 --> 00:25:54,185
He will update you
about the PRG's every move here in Urdan.

220
00:26:00,959 --> 00:26:02,427
Sir, I won't stay long.

221
00:26:02,494 --> 00:26:05,263
PRG might get suspicious.
I'll just text you.

222
00:26:06,097 --> 00:26:07,198
Thank you for your help.

223
00:26:07,265 --> 00:26:10,569
We have the same goal.
To take down the PRG.

224
00:26:12,704 --> 00:26:16,141
It's been a year since I became crippled.

225
00:26:16,207 --> 00:26:20,645
Until now,
Lucas still hasn't captured the enemy.

226
00:26:20,712 --> 00:26:23,515
You know, your brother will not marry…

227
00:26:24,583 --> 00:26:27,419
until he exacts revenge
on the person who did this to me.

228
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:29,621
For our country.

229
00:26:31,623 --> 00:26:33,258
And for my father as well.

230
00:27:02,487 --> 00:27:03,688
This belongs to Diego, right?

231
00:27:03,755 --> 00:27:06,324
-Did he come here?
-Yesterday, Captain.

232
00:27:06,391 --> 00:27:09,160
He didn't say anything
and he left right away.

233
00:27:09,227 --> 00:27:12,030
<i>You passed by the military camp.</i>
<i>They sent reinforcements.</i>

234
00:27:12,097 --> 00:27:14,532
I saw, but they can't be too sure, Greg,

235
00:27:14,599 --> 00:27:16,901
because we will also strengthen
our force here in Urdan.

236
00:27:16,968 --> 00:27:18,637
The PRG comes here?

237
00:27:18,703 --> 00:27:21,840
They're troubling our lives,
and this town.

238
00:27:21,906 --> 00:27:25,677
I really hope all this will end soon
so you can be reunited with your sister.

239
00:27:25,744 --> 00:27:28,546
I'm planning to sign up
for a medical mission in Urdan.

240
00:27:28,613 --> 00:27:30,115
That's good, Maxine.

241
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:34,052
It's a small world, indeed.

242
00:27:34,119 --> 00:27:35,520
Dr. Maxine Dela Cruz.

243
00:27:35,587 --> 00:27:36,921
<i>What's your plan now?</i>

244
00:27:36,988 --> 00:27:38,990
<i>What do you mean?</i>
<i>It's nothing to worry about.</i>

245
00:27:39,057 --> 00:27:41,026
<i>It's just work, nothing personal.</i>
