1
00:00:11,244 --> 00:00:16,049
This is the first time I hear someone
that she's in a love triangle.

2
00:00:16,549 --> 00:00:18,918
The truth is, we're not really
in a love triangle.

3
00:00:18,985 --> 00:00:21,254
Because I was the matchmaker.

4
00:00:21,321 --> 00:00:24,824
<i>What's happening to us, Diego?</i>
<i>We were just pretending.</i>

5
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:27,660
Why did we have to make it real
you're just going to leave me?

6
00:00:27,727 --> 00:00:30,930
I just thought of Moira and Diego.
They look good together.

7
00:00:31,398 --> 00:00:33,500
See, they're both soldiers.

8
00:00:33,566 --> 00:00:36,269
I think they understand each other better.

9
00:00:36,903 --> 00:00:39,305
You're the bravest woman I've met.

10
00:00:39,372 --> 00:00:41,107
You shouldn't be crying because of me.

11
00:00:41,307 --> 00:00:42,375
Moira, just leave me.

12
00:00:42,442 --> 00:00:45,111
<i>If that's what you really want,</i>
<i>I'll start now.</i>

13
00:00:45,278 --> 00:00:48,314
But a soldier is not
a suitable match for a doctor?

14
00:00:48,381 --> 00:00:50,216
<i>We're really different.</i>

15
00:00:50,817 --> 00:00:52,419
<i>Maybe it's best that we let things be.</i>

16
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:54,254
<i>I left Diego on the road.</i>

17
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:56,589
Diego is wounded. He needs a doctor.

18
00:00:56,656 --> 00:00:59,092
-My buddy and I will take care of it.
-What do you mean 'buddy'?

19
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:00,126
<i>I don't understand.</i>

20
00:01:00,226 --> 00:01:03,463
<i>Why he didn't come</i>
<i>to the Medicube for treatment.</i>

21
00:01:03,696 --> 00:01:04,964
<i>He doesn't want me to know.</i>

22
00:01:05,031 --> 00:01:07,967
He doesn't want me to worry
and care for him.

23
00:01:08,034 --> 00:01:09,936
<i>He wants me to stay away from him.</i>

24
00:01:10,003 --> 00:01:12,639
I don't trust soldiers because
of what happened to my brother.

25
00:01:12,705 --> 00:01:19,512
If you were a soldier, it will be
for us to be together because…

26
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:20,680
Don't force it.

27
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:22,749
I'm fine with us being buddies.

28
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:28,021
I'm going to drink this wine…

29
00:01:53,847 --> 00:01:54,848
I am jealous.

30
00:01:57,584 --> 00:02:01,688
So please, stay away from him.

31
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:22,742
<i>He said we can ask for anything.</i>

32
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:28,014
Why didn't you ask
for a trip to Brunei or Maldives?

33
00:02:28,781 --> 00:02:31,017
So you want us to go to Maldives?

34
00:02:31,084 --> 00:02:34,020
That's not what I mean.
I mean is you wasted your card.

35
00:02:34,087 --> 00:02:37,323
It won't go to waste if it means
I can spend time alone with you.

36
00:03:07,787 --> 00:03:14,727
If you were a soldier, it will be
for us to be together because…

37
00:03:14,794 --> 00:03:16,162
Don't force it.

38
00:03:16,229 --> 00:03:18,531
I'm fine with us being buddies.

39
00:03:18,598 --> 00:03:20,500
Friends, right?

40
00:04:47,086 --> 00:04:50,490
You think your problems are over
because you became close with Fayad?

41
00:04:51,024 --> 00:04:52,792
You think you won't be punished anymore?

42
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:20,053
That looks delicious, Marty.

43
00:05:20,253 --> 00:05:22,588
Of course. I prepared it
especially for both of you.

44
00:05:24,857 --> 00:05:25,992
Thank you, Talledo.

45
00:05:28,561 --> 00:05:29,429
Sir, how are you?

46
00:05:31,264 --> 00:05:33,466
I'll feed you,
so you can eat while it's hot.

47
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:38,338
No need, I can do it.

48
00:05:59,258 --> 00:06:00,093
How about you?

49
00:06:00,159 --> 00:06:01,327
Why don't you eat too?

50
00:06:02,895 --> 00:06:04,430
You haven't had breakfast yet, right?

51
00:06:09,602 --> 00:06:10,470
Talledo.

52
00:06:11,337 --> 00:06:12,872
Where is Capt. Manalo?

53
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:16,709
I was just gone for a short while
and you miss me already?

54
00:06:19,278 --> 00:06:21,347
So? How did it go?

55
00:06:21,948 --> 00:06:23,950
Well, as expected.

56
00:06:24,951 --> 00:06:25,885
How about you?

57
00:06:25,952 --> 00:06:28,688
Moira stayed by your side the whole night.
Were you able to talk to her?

58
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:32,692
The question is, when are you coming back?

59
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:34,427
Get out of there.

60
00:06:35,361 --> 00:06:37,530
They might give you more punishment.

61
00:06:39,599 --> 00:06:42,034
You are clingy.
Are you going to confess already?

62
00:06:56,048 --> 00:06:57,650
Fine. I'm clingy.

63
00:06:58,217 --> 00:07:01,020
Don't worry, they're just friends.

64
00:07:25,511 --> 00:07:27,346
Dr. Dela Cruz, what are you doing here?

65
00:07:27,413 --> 00:07:30,249
You punished Lucas?

66
00:07:30,316 --> 00:07:31,684
But Fayad is doing okay.

67
00:07:31,751 --> 00:07:33,119
Why did you have to summon him?

68
00:07:33,186 --> 00:07:35,388
The patient is alive, so your job is done.

69
00:07:35,488 --> 00:07:37,323
But what Capt. Manalo did is still wrong.

70
00:07:40,426 --> 00:07:41,527
Will you lock him up?

71
00:07:44,063 --> 00:07:47,233
But I can tell you,
he won't get promoted to a higher rank.

72
00:07:49,435 --> 00:07:51,370
So, the next time you insist
on having it your way.

73
00:07:51,437 --> 00:07:53,039
What Lucas and I did was right.

74
00:07:53,105 --> 00:07:55,308
He shouldn't be punished
for saving a life.

75
00:07:57,009 --> 00:08:00,713
Are your rules more important
than a human life?

76
00:08:05,117 --> 00:08:05,985
-Maxine,
-Well,

77
00:08:06,052 --> 00:08:07,987
you don't know how to fight
fair and square.

78
00:08:08,054 --> 00:08:09,956
Maxine, that's enough.

79
00:08:10,022 --> 00:08:11,591
What you did to my brother…

80
00:08:11,657 --> 00:08:13,459
That's what you're doing right now to…

81
00:08:13,526 --> 00:08:15,495
-Enough.
-That's what you're doing to Lucas.

82
00:08:16,028 --> 00:08:19,632
They are good people but you punish them,
you betray them.

83
00:08:19,699 --> 00:08:20,700
Maxine, that's enough.

84
00:08:36,582 --> 00:08:38,784
-Is that his antibiotics?
-Yes.

85
00:08:39,452 --> 00:08:40,586
I'll take care of it.

86
00:08:49,595 --> 00:08:52,098
I'll check your temperature, too.

87
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:57,370
Moira, I can handle it.

88
00:08:58,571 --> 00:08:59,839
I'll take care of myself.

89
00:09:01,607 --> 00:09:03,309
Besides, there are nurses here.

90
00:09:05,244 --> 00:09:07,346
You don't have to stay to take care of me.

91
00:09:08,447 --> 00:09:10,249
You can't make me leave, Diego.

92
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:15,755
I tried to do what you want.

93
00:09:16,989 --> 00:09:18,491
I tried to get mad at you

94
00:09:19,492 --> 00:09:22,228
because it might be the way to forget you.

95
00:09:23,296 --> 00:09:24,630
But it's not effective.

96
00:09:26,532 --> 00:09:27,900
Just a little fever,

97
00:09:27,967 --> 00:09:32,405
just a little infection,
that is nothing serious

98
00:09:32,471 --> 00:09:33,472
and I get so anxious.

99
00:09:34,774 --> 00:09:36,642
I just want to make sure that you're okay.

100
00:09:37,843 --> 00:09:39,679
But I'm fine.

101
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:41,180
I love you so much, Diego.

102
00:09:44,717 --> 00:09:48,387
Whatever you do or say,

103
00:09:50,389 --> 00:09:52,258
I will fight for what I feel for you.

104
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:06,872
Hey, are you mad?

105
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,408
Why are you mad at me?

106
00:10:09,809 --> 00:10:11,077
I just defended you

107
00:10:11,143 --> 00:10:12,979
because I don't want you
to be punished because of me.

108
00:10:13,045 --> 00:10:13,913
Because of you…

109
00:10:15,815 --> 00:10:17,149
Because of you, yes, that's right.

110
00:10:17,216 --> 00:10:19,218
Because of you, I disobeyed direct orders.

111
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:21,887
It was because of you.
I sacrificed my career for you.

112
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:22,822
-For me?
-Yes, for you.

113
00:10:22,888 --> 00:10:23,756
-For you!
-Did you?

114
00:10:23,823 --> 00:10:25,424
-Yes, for you. Isn't it clear?
-Lucas!

115
00:10:25,491 --> 00:10:26,892
Lucas, listen to me.

116
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:30,730
it was a person's life at stake
against that order you disobeyed.

117
00:10:33,032 --> 00:10:36,936
Tell me which law is just.
The law of your profession?

118
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:40,072
Blind obedience?

119
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:43,376
Or the most important law,
which is to save the lives?

120
00:10:44,944 --> 00:10:45,778
What?

121
00:10:48,881 --> 00:10:50,616
I grew up in a military camp.

122
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:55,187
I saw how honorable it is
to become a soldier.

123
00:10:57,390 --> 00:11:00,760
I told myself,
someday I'm going to be like my father

124
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:01,927
because I idolize him.

125
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:03,629
I want to be like him.

126
00:11:03,696 --> 00:11:05,998
When I decided to join the academy,

127
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:12,938
he told me that honor
is not only in the job that you do,

128
00:11:14,206 --> 00:11:15,508
but in the character as well.

129
00:11:15,608 --> 00:11:16,676
There you go.

130
00:11:17,743 --> 00:11:18,978
You knew it all along.

131
00:11:20,146 --> 00:11:23,115
Wasn't it more important
to save Fayad's life

132
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:24,450
than to listen to their orders?

133
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:26,519
What if Fayad died?

134
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:28,921
How can we face them?

135
00:11:29,455 --> 00:11:30,556
We can't, right?

136
00:11:30,956 --> 00:11:33,459
Okay, fine. You're right.

137
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:36,662
We did a noble thing
saving a person's life.

138
00:11:37,129 --> 00:11:39,265
But Maxine,
there's no perfect institution.

139
00:11:39,331 --> 00:11:42,101
You have to accept that there
is also honor in humility.

140
00:11:42,568 --> 00:11:44,503
No matter what you say,
what I did was still wrong.

141
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:46,972
And whatever you say,
I am still a soldier.

142
00:11:49,775 --> 00:11:52,378
From now on, I will no longer meddle
in your affairs.

143
00:12:46,632 --> 00:12:49,568
I did it out of concern,
yet he thinks I did wrong?

144
00:12:50,169 --> 00:12:52,838
Now it's my fault?

145
00:12:53,739 --> 00:12:55,407
<i>Just try to understand him.</i>

146
00:12:56,208 --> 00:12:59,612
You're coming from different perspectives.

147
00:12:59,678 --> 00:13:00,880
<i>He's a soldier,</i>

148
00:13:01,747 --> 00:13:05,518
<i>of course what's important for him</i>
<i>is honor and dignity.</i>

149
00:13:06,652 --> 00:13:10,556
Shouting at his superior was embarrassing.

150
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:15,861
I could not help myself.

151
00:13:17,763 --> 00:13:21,367
I was reminded of my brother.

152
00:13:22,368 --> 00:13:25,905
So, you're comparing Lucas
to your brother?

153
00:13:26,071 --> 00:13:27,873
Is he that important to you?

154
00:13:28,073 --> 00:13:29,308
Do you still like him?

155
00:13:29,775 --> 00:13:32,077
What? Do I still like him?

156
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:38,918
What I like is to stab him.
He really got on my nerves.

157
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:42,688
Don't he dare come near me
or else, he's dead.

158
00:13:49,461 --> 00:13:53,499
Sandra, I'll call you later.

159
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:05,010
Really, you will stab me?

160
00:14:05,578 --> 00:14:08,581
I thought you made an oath?
"First, do no harm."

161
00:14:12,985 --> 00:14:14,787
I'm sorry if I got harsh earlier.

162
00:14:15,888 --> 00:14:19,225
You know how important
being a soldier is to me.

163
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,428
That is who I am.

164
00:14:24,263 --> 00:14:27,867
And being a doctor is who I am, but…

165
00:14:29,435 --> 00:14:31,937
I just can't accept orders

166
00:14:32,071 --> 00:14:35,007
that prioritize other things
over the lives of the people.

167
00:14:35,474 --> 00:14:37,476
How is that? You will just comply?

168
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:40,546
You'll just accept it
even if you know you are right?

169
00:14:45,517 --> 00:14:47,720
Seems like we won't really
understand each other.

170
00:14:48,187 --> 00:14:49,188
I told you.

171
00:14:51,357 --> 00:14:52,224
We are different.

172
00:14:54,827 --> 00:14:58,330
But why do I still like you
a lot despite that?

173
00:15:04,169 --> 00:15:05,738
That will eventually fade away.

174
00:15:06,705 --> 00:15:08,974
You'll realize that
we're not meant for each other.

175
00:15:09,508 --> 00:15:11,977
Here, just drink.

176
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:13,979
Is that what you are doing now?

177
00:15:14,446 --> 00:15:15,748
Are you going to drink or not?

178
00:15:16,348 --> 00:15:18,851
It's prohibited.
We're in the camp and I'm on duty.

179
00:15:24,623 --> 00:15:25,925
But I can make an exception.

180
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:50,309
You can have that.

181
00:17:33,185 --> 00:17:34,019
Excuse me.

182
00:17:35,287 --> 00:17:36,121
Maxine…

183
00:17:37,156 --> 00:17:38,791
Pull yourself together.

184
00:17:41,927 --> 00:17:43,796
Calm down.

185
00:17:44,296 --> 00:17:46,065
Don't get affected.

186
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:55,174
This is wrong.
I should've brought the wine.

187
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:15,527
He's not well enough for that.

188
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:18,397
Let's just drink that once
he gets discharged.

189
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:22,468
You only have fifteen minutes.

190
00:18:22,534 --> 00:18:24,269
My patient still needs to rest.

191
00:18:36,849 --> 00:18:39,551
It looks like Moira is in a good mood.

192
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,621
Are you back together?

193
00:18:45,691 --> 00:18:47,759
Bro, don't make it difficult for her.

194
00:18:48,527 --> 00:18:50,929
You're lucky Moira is always by your side.

195
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:55,601
Unlike the woman I like
who is always avoiding me.

196
00:18:56,401 --> 00:18:57,236
Unbelievable.

197
00:19:00,839 --> 00:19:02,107
Stop playing hard-to-get.

198
00:19:07,513 --> 00:19:08,380
What did you say?

199
00:19:15,954 --> 00:19:16,788
Diego…

200
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:20,826
What is it?

201
00:19:20,893 --> 00:19:22,394
I wanted to know if you stink.

202
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:24,596
You said Maxine is avoiding you.

203
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:28,734
Do I stink?

204
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,035
I can't smell it.

205
00:19:30,435 --> 00:19:31,403
I'm not sure.

206
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:33,005
-Let me check again.
-Check it again.

207
00:19:33,572 --> 00:19:34,473
Wait.

208
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:36,808
Here.

209
00:19:38,043 --> 00:19:40,179
-Do I stink?
-No. I can't smell anything.

210
00:19:40,779 --> 00:19:42,981
What about me? Can you check?
I probably stink, too.

211
00:19:46,251 --> 00:19:47,085
On the left?

212
00:19:48,453 --> 00:19:49,688
Nothing?

213
00:19:54,459 --> 00:19:56,128
It looks like your patient is doing fine.

214
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:03,535
He's fine.

215
00:20:49,948 --> 00:20:53,185
Huff, huff.

216
00:20:59,157 --> 00:21:00,859
Your wound is no longer infected.

217
00:21:01,226 --> 00:21:03,061
Just continue taking the oral antibiotics.

218
00:21:03,128 --> 00:21:03,996
Thank you, Doc.

219
00:21:04,062 --> 00:21:05,564
Don't thank me.

220
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:08,133
It was Moira who took care of you.

221
00:21:13,872 --> 00:21:16,908
Moira, I'll leave my team with you.

222
00:21:17,376 --> 00:21:20,512
I have a scheduled visit to Sitio Santos.

223
00:21:21,013 --> 00:21:24,016
I'll teach the children
about proper hygiene,

224
00:21:24,082 --> 00:21:26,585
washing of hands
and proper way of brushing their teeth.

225
00:21:26,652 --> 00:21:27,719
Okay, Doc.

226
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:30,722
What? You will still go there, Doc?

227
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:32,357
After what happened to us?

228
00:21:32,424 --> 00:21:35,994
Sorry, Doc, but we we're traumatized
by what happened.

229
00:21:36,395 --> 00:21:40,299
That's right Maxine. Postpone it for now.
You can visit when it's already safe.

230
00:21:40,532 --> 00:21:42,567
I can't. People are expecting me there.

231
00:21:43,435 --> 00:21:48,006
It's wrong for them to suffer
of what happened to Alif, right?

232
00:21:48,707 --> 00:21:50,142
They have nothing to do with that.

233
00:21:50,776 --> 00:21:52,110
Dr. Maxine is right.

234
00:21:52,177 --> 00:21:56,448
We're unable to help a lot of people
because they are in dangerous locations.

235
00:21:57,916 --> 00:21:59,885
It is them who needs us most.

236
00:22:02,054 --> 00:22:04,556
If I only have a gun, I'll escort you.

237
00:22:04,623 --> 00:22:05,524
The thing is…

238
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:09,027
Don't worry, I'll go with her.

239
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:13,699
So, we leave in ten minutes?

240
00:22:46,598 --> 00:22:47,499
Are you all right?

241
00:22:52,237 --> 00:22:53,238
Don't be nervous.

242
00:22:53,772 --> 00:22:54,873
I'll take care of you.

243
00:22:56,808 --> 00:22:58,043
I'm not scared.

244
00:23:02,948 --> 00:23:05,283
It seems like you're nervous?

245
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:11,356
Is it because I kissed you last night?

246
00:23:17,329 --> 00:23:19,131
I don't want to talk about that.

247
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:22,067
Why bring it up?

248
00:23:22,134 --> 00:23:24,236
Why are you mad? I was just asking.

249
00:23:30,308 --> 00:23:32,811
If you only knew.

250
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:35,580
I was very nervous.

251
00:23:37,482 --> 00:23:38,483
It seems like…

252
00:23:39,951 --> 00:23:45,123
I hesitated a thousand times
before I had the guts to do it.

253
00:23:48,026 --> 00:23:53,532
Maxine, I know you said we're different
and we should just be friends. But…

254
00:23:56,034 --> 00:24:00,138
I really can't deny what I feel.

255
00:24:24,896 --> 00:24:30,402
Just put your fingers on your other palm.
Then you move it in circles.

256
00:24:31,102 --> 00:24:34,372
Just like that, so you can take out
the dirt in your fingernails.

257
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:36,708
Then, the other hand.

258
00:24:36,775 --> 00:24:39,177
Rinse your hands properly.

259
00:24:40,245 --> 00:24:42,080
Wash it thoroughly.

260
00:24:42,914 --> 00:24:44,316
Make sure there's no soap anymore.

261
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:49,654
Okay, and later,
we'll wipe it with a clean towel.

262
00:24:51,623 --> 00:24:57,095
After this, I'll teach you
how to properly brush your teeth.

263
00:24:58,964 --> 00:24:59,865
It still has suds.

264
00:25:01,366 --> 00:25:02,968
After washing your hands,

265
00:25:03,034 --> 00:25:05,003
the doctor will teach you
how to brush your teeth

266
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:07,272
so your teeth won't fall off.

267
00:25:10,208 --> 00:25:11,476
What did you tell them?

268
00:25:13,578 --> 00:25:15,547
I just translated what you said, ma'am.

269
00:25:17,148 --> 00:25:18,583
Then, why are they laughing?

270
00:25:19,918 --> 00:25:20,886
I don't know, ma'am

271
00:25:29,661 --> 00:25:30,996
-Captain.
-Yes?

272
00:25:32,163 --> 00:25:33,565
Do you like Doc Beauty?

273
00:25:35,834 --> 00:25:38,203
Why? Is it too obvious?

274
00:25:42,474 --> 00:25:44,209
Don't get angry, Biboy.

275
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:46,478
I don't stand a chance with Doc Beauty.

276
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:53,051
We should take you to the love tree.

277
00:25:53,118 --> 00:25:54,319
Love tree?

278
00:25:54,386 --> 00:25:57,923
You should carve you name
so you will end up together!

279
00:26:02,727 --> 00:26:03,562
Let's go!

280
00:26:04,329 --> 00:26:05,597
Where is the love tree?

281
00:26:05,664 --> 00:26:07,933
Lucas, where are you going?

282
00:26:07,999 --> 00:26:09,434
We're not done yet! Hey!

283
00:26:25,483 --> 00:26:28,253
Are you sure about this, Biboy?
Maybe you're just playing jokes on me.

284
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:31,122
There. Sheila loves Norman.

285
00:26:31,523 --> 00:26:32,991
Those are my parents' initials.

286
00:26:33,058 --> 00:26:35,427
They ended up together
because of the love tree.

287
00:26:46,171 --> 00:26:47,005
Are you sure, Biboy?

288
00:26:47,072 --> 00:26:48,139
Is it okay with you?

289
00:26:48,673 --> 00:26:50,976
I thought you're going to court
Doc Beauty when you grow up.

290
00:26:53,111 --> 00:26:53,945
Lucas…

291
00:26:56,781 --> 00:26:58,049
What are you doing here?

292
00:26:59,050 --> 00:27:02,153
Doc Beauty, I can no longer make you wait

293
00:27:02,887 --> 00:27:04,589
because you might get sad.

294
00:27:04,656 --> 00:27:06,224
It will take some time before I grow up.

295
00:27:07,726 --> 00:27:08,660
Biboy?

296
00:27:09,394 --> 00:27:12,097
It's okay with me if the Captain
becomes your boyfriend.

297
00:27:17,268 --> 00:27:18,670
Did you make Biboy say that?

298
00:27:19,237 --> 00:27:20,205
Of course not.

299
00:27:20,271 --> 00:27:22,974
I am shocked too. He's mature.

300
00:27:24,943 --> 00:27:27,312
Come on, Doc Beauty, say yes to Cap.

301
00:28:38,883 --> 00:28:40,485
<i>Are you jealous of Denise?</i>

302
00:28:40,618 --> 00:28:41,820
Don't get jealous, okay?

303
00:28:41,886 --> 00:28:43,021
I'm only yours.

304
00:28:43,088 --> 00:28:45,857
Don't get mad at me.
I'm just a fan of "GoRa".

305
00:28:46,324 --> 00:28:47,659
-"GoRa"?
-Diego-Moira.

306
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:48,693
We're in trouble.

307
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:51,129
It looks like Captain Moira
will end up with someone else

308
00:28:51,196 --> 00:28:52,564
because you keep on avoiding her.

309
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:55,800
This is the end of the Special
Forces Team that you brag about.

310
00:28:58,136 --> 00:29:00,171
Hey, let him go.

311
00:29:00,238 --> 00:29:01,940
Let him go!

312
00:29:02,006 --> 00:29:03,775
-Obey the Captain's order.
-Greg?

313
00:29:03,842 --> 00:29:04,743
Lucas.

314
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:14,319
-Maxine?
-Lucas, help me, please.

315
00:29:14,385 --> 00:29:17,555
I don't want to die. Please, come here.
