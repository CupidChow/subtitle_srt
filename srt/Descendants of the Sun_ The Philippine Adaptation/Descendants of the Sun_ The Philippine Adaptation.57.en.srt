1
00:00:11,244 --> 00:00:14,014
Doc Maxine and Big Boss are both missing.

2
00:00:14,581 --> 00:00:15,849
I have a bad feeling.

3
00:00:15,915 --> 00:00:17,250
It's Doc Maxine.

4
00:00:17,317 --> 00:00:18,351
What about her?

5
00:00:18,418 --> 00:00:21,621
Rodel, stop it! What's wrong with you?
I won't allow you to hurt Lucas.

6
00:00:21,688 --> 00:00:22,789
You know what, Maxine?

7
00:00:23,656 --> 00:00:26,026
You are blinded by your love for that man.

8
00:00:26,092 --> 00:00:27,761
That's why he deserves to die!

9
00:00:27,827 --> 00:00:28,895
Rodel!

10
00:00:37,537 --> 00:00:39,139
Go back to where you came from.

11
00:00:39,205 --> 00:00:40,206
Leave!

12
00:00:40,273 --> 00:00:41,741
We'll see each other again, Manalo.

13
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:43,643
<i>Why did you mention her name?</i>

14
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:47,514
She was asking me earlier
about the PRG camp.

15
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:51,918
-Maybe that's where she went.
-If you know something, tell us now.

16
00:00:51,985 --> 00:00:55,755
All this time, we were both looking
for the same person.

17
00:00:57,190 --> 00:00:58,892
When I met you…

18
00:00:58,958 --> 00:01:01,761
you were angry at soldiers
because of what they did to your brother.

19
00:01:01,828 --> 00:01:05,365
Now that you found him, did you join them?

20
00:01:05,432 --> 00:01:06,800
Bullet!

21
00:01:06,866 --> 00:01:09,102
Captain Manalo is still in the area
with my sister.

22
00:01:09,169 --> 00:01:11,438
Go after them! They haven't gone far.

23
00:01:11,504 --> 00:01:13,907
<i>Did it change how you see me, Lucas?</i>

24
00:01:13,973 --> 00:01:16,943
Did it change
because Bullet is my brother?

25
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:19,179
I won't break up with you, Maxine.

26
00:01:19,245 --> 00:01:21,414
Yes, you hurt me, but I love you.

27
00:01:21,481 --> 00:01:24,651
<i>Admit it.
This will affect our relationship.</i>

28
00:01:24,717 --> 00:01:28,455
You are a soldier,
and my brother is a rebel leader.

29
00:01:28,521 --> 00:01:31,925
I have a feeling
Colonel Garcia already knows about this.

30
00:01:31,991 --> 00:01:33,993
<i>That's why I'm scared.</i>

31
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:37,130
Wolf, we have company.

32
00:01:42,469 --> 00:01:47,373
I cling to the hope that time will come
when everything will be all right.

33
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:50,710
When soldiers and rebels will forge peace.

34
00:02:55,108 --> 00:02:58,077
The PRG rebels who were after us
are engaged in a gunfight.

35
00:02:59,379 --> 00:03:01,614
Does it mean
soldiers are here to rescue us?

36
00:03:02,215 --> 00:03:03,683
I'm sure it's the Alpha Team.

37
00:03:09,889 --> 00:03:11,024
Snoopy, flank.

38
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:23,703
The gunshots are nearby.
It looks like they're coming.

39
00:03:24,771 --> 00:03:26,739
What if they question us in the camp?

40
00:03:27,674 --> 00:03:30,910
What if they ask what we're doing here?

41
00:03:31,511 --> 00:03:32,679
What will we tell them?

42
00:03:39,185 --> 00:03:40,954
Wait a second! Hold on.

43
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:44,390
Our priority is Big Boss, okay?

44
00:04:08,548 --> 00:04:10,817
Wolf, there's a hut.

45
00:04:11,985 --> 00:04:13,052
Maybe they're here.

46
00:04:22,996 --> 00:04:23,997
They're here.

47
00:04:29,535 --> 00:04:31,704
-Lucas? How…
-Maxine.

48
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:34,073
Listen to me, I will protect you.

49
00:04:34,674 --> 00:04:37,076
Don't say anything.
I will take care of everything.

50
00:04:44,584 --> 00:04:45,585
Do you understand?

51
00:04:46,352 --> 00:04:47,353
Yes.

52
00:05:35,935 --> 00:05:37,737
We need to take him to the Medicube.

53
00:05:37,804 --> 00:05:41,407
Wolf, Big Boss is here. He's wounded.

54
00:05:46,379 --> 00:05:50,383
<i>What are you doing there?
Why did you go near the PRG camp?</i>

55
00:05:52,318 --> 00:05:55,555
Let's talk later, just send for backup.
We are on our way back.

56
00:05:57,990 --> 00:05:59,058
Let's go, Big Boss.

57
00:06:08,601 --> 00:06:10,937
-Doc, I'll go ahead.
-Okay, thank you.

58
00:06:14,607 --> 00:06:17,343
Nurse Hazel will be back
with your antibiotics,

59
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:19,345
and then later with the pain killers.

60
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:24,050
Don't strain that too much.

61
00:06:26,085 --> 00:06:27,220
This is nothing, Doc.

62
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:34,193
It doesn't hurt right now,
but I can handle this.

63
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:43,202
How about with Colonel Garcia?

64
00:06:44,337 --> 00:06:45,371
Can you handle him?

65
00:06:47,206 --> 00:06:48,908
Lucas, he is very mad at you.

66
00:06:49,776 --> 00:06:52,311
And it seems he is serious
in punishing you.

67
00:06:52,378 --> 00:06:53,379
I know.

68
00:06:55,014 --> 00:06:56,282
He is my superior.

69
00:06:57,784 --> 00:06:59,819
I would have to face him no matter what.

70
00:06:59,886 --> 00:07:01,854
That's what I'm worried about.

71
00:07:07,527 --> 00:07:09,028
Just trust me.

72
00:07:10,163 --> 00:07:11,431
I will take care of you.

73
00:07:12,165 --> 00:07:13,633
And then what?

74
00:07:15,001 --> 00:07:16,369
You'll cover up for me?

75
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:18,838
You will lie?

76
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:21,974
I have a plan.

77
00:07:23,409 --> 00:07:28,080
Maxine, don't ever mention Bullet or Rodel
while in the camp.

78
00:07:28,147 --> 00:07:29,215
Just do as I say.

79
00:07:30,016 --> 00:07:31,083
This is for you.

80
00:07:41,694 --> 00:07:43,963
Your blood pressure is elevated.

81
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:47,166
I told you,
you are not ready to get out yet.

82
00:07:52,338 --> 00:07:53,439
Does it still hurt?

83
00:08:06,452 --> 00:08:09,889
-<i>Don't you want to take me out on a date?
-I can no longer do that.</i>

84
00:08:09,956 --> 00:08:12,859
-What?
-We are not meant for each other.

85
00:08:12,925 --> 00:08:14,360
I'm sorry.

86
00:08:14,427 --> 00:08:17,263
Captain Moira Defensor,
it's over between us.

87
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:21,234
<i>I thought you didn't care anymore?
You broke up with me, remember?</i>

88
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:22,869
<i>I thought you were brave.</i>

89
00:08:22,935 --> 00:08:27,740
But you can't even tell me
why you broke up with me.

90
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:32,912
Diego, I don't need your apology.

91
00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:35,448
He was against our relationship before

92
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:41,087
because he was afraid we will find out
about his connection to my mother.

93
00:08:41,153 --> 00:08:44,090
<i>I'm sorry, Moira, because I've hurt you.</i>

94
00:08:44,657 --> 00:08:50,162
<i>But every time I see you,
I remember all the pain and anger.</i>

95
00:08:50,229 --> 00:08:52,231
<i>What about us?</i>

96
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:58,971
Is it that easy for you
to give up everything we fought for?

97
00:09:06,746 --> 00:09:08,514
Moira, please forgive me.

98
00:09:10,983 --> 00:09:13,786
Forgive me if I let go of your hands.

99
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:18,958
I will never do that again.

100
00:09:28,801 --> 00:09:30,403
I know I've hurt you.

101
00:09:34,106 --> 00:09:36,909
I punished you
for mistakes you didn't commit.

102
00:09:39,946 --> 00:09:41,013
Forgive me.

103
00:09:45,885 --> 00:09:49,155
I hope you can give me another chance
to show you…

104
00:09:51,057 --> 00:09:52,525
to prove to you…

105
00:09:55,361 --> 00:09:56,896
how much I love you.

106
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:49,248
You finished your food.

107
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:52,685
-Here, take your medicine.
-Thank you.

108
00:11:03,195 --> 00:11:04,797
By the way, where is Doc Maxine?

109
00:11:06,732 --> 00:11:09,235
Colonel Garcia cornered us.

110
00:11:09,969 --> 00:11:11,837
He wanted to talk to her.

111
00:11:16,976 --> 00:11:19,478
Captain, your wound might bleed.

112
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:26,485
Now, tell me why you went to the PRG camp?

113
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,955
I already told you the reason, Colonel.

114
00:11:36,862 --> 00:11:38,497
I don't believe you.

115
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:42,635
If you were really worried
about Captain Manalo…

116
00:11:43,302 --> 00:11:44,837
why didn't you tell us?

117
00:11:46,172 --> 00:11:47,773
You're a smart person, doctor.

118
00:11:48,941 --> 00:11:54,013
You know a doctor can't do anything
if the rebels take her boyfriend.

119
00:11:57,683 --> 00:12:00,052
You have been abducted twice
by the PRG, right?

120
00:12:02,121 --> 00:12:06,258
Why does it seem like
you're still willing to go back there

121
00:12:06,325 --> 00:12:08,594
even though you know how dangerous it is?

122
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:12,064
What's in that place?

123
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:15,835
Why do they always call for you?

124
00:12:17,103 --> 00:12:18,437
Why, doctor?

125
00:12:20,306 --> 00:12:24,510
Maxine, don't ever mention Bullet or Rodel
while in the camp.

126
00:12:25,144 --> 00:12:26,245
Just do as I say.

127
00:12:27,046 --> 00:12:28,047
This is for you.

128
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:42,895
Sir, please don't pick on Maxine.
This is my responsibility.

129
00:12:43,362 --> 00:12:44,463
I will answer for this.

130
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:45,898
I'm not talking to you!

131
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:49,001
You're really used to disrespecting me.

132
00:12:50,536 --> 00:12:54,373
Sir, with all due respect,
I'm just saying what's right.

133
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,808
You dare answer back!

134
00:13:00,546 --> 00:13:02,181
Coronel, that's enough, please.

135
00:13:11,423 --> 00:13:12,458
Let's talk.

136
00:13:32,511 --> 00:13:35,347
What you did earlier
is unbecoming of an officer.

137
00:13:40,186 --> 00:13:41,487
It will not happen again.

138
00:13:42,555 --> 00:13:43,789
It shouldn't.

139
00:13:44,757 --> 00:13:48,227
Because if that happens again,
you will have to answer to me.

140
00:13:55,534 --> 00:13:59,738
I have my suspicions about Captain Manalo
and his doctor girlfriend.

141
00:14:01,307 --> 00:14:03,142
That's why he doesn't want her
to talk to me.

142
00:14:04,777 --> 00:14:06,145
They are hiding something.

143
00:14:08,948 --> 00:14:10,182
What is it, Colonel?

144
00:14:12,952 --> 00:14:17,223
What do you… What do you want to know?

145
00:14:17,756 --> 00:14:19,191
Where is the PRG's camp?

146
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:22,194
I don't know.

147
00:14:22,795 --> 00:14:25,397
I was blindfolded when I was taken there.

148
00:14:26,565 --> 00:14:29,535
How did you access the PRG camp?

149
00:14:29,602 --> 00:14:31,136
Do you have a contact inside?

150
00:14:32,238 --> 00:14:33,072
What?

151
00:14:33,138 --> 00:14:35,808
It is impossible for you
to go there alone…

152
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:37,643
if you have no contact from inside.

153
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:43,148
Do you have a contact inside the PRG?

154
00:14:45,618 --> 00:14:49,221
Sir, we can't force Maxine to talk
until she's ready.

155
00:14:49,288 --> 00:14:52,658
Clearly, she is still traumatized
with what happened.

156
00:14:53,492 --> 00:14:55,427
It looks like she has a connection
in the PRG.

157
00:14:56,428 --> 00:14:58,297
That's why Captain Manalo
is covering for her.

158
00:15:05,004 --> 00:15:06,839
I know Lucas very well.

159
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,208
Especially his father.

160
00:15:15,881 --> 00:15:20,686
With all due respect, sir.
We have to investigate everything.

161
00:15:22,855 --> 00:15:27,793
We are in a dangerous situation
against the PRG.

162
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:30,129
No one should come between us
and the rebels.

163
00:15:30,696 --> 00:15:33,599
And if it can be proven
that you have a connection with the PRG…

164
00:15:34,633 --> 00:15:37,136
you will not only be dismissed
from military service.

165
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:39,438
You can also go to prison.

166
00:15:40,539 --> 00:15:44,543
Can you face all of that, Captain Manalo?

167
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:04,863
Sir, please don't pick on Maxine.
This is my responsibility.

168
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:05,864
I will answer for this.

169
00:16:05,931 --> 00:16:08,000
You're really used to disrespecting me.

170
00:16:09,401 --> 00:16:13,405
Sir, with all due respect,
I'm just saying what's right.

171
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:14,807
You dare answer back!

172
00:16:21,547 --> 00:16:25,017
I'll discharge this patient.
I'm off duty, anyway.

173
00:16:26,118 --> 00:16:28,420
Doc Maxine,
it seems like you need more rest.

174
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:37,963
It's just… I will be fine.

175
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:42,668
Doc, don't worry.

176
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:44,837
You know Big Boss, right?

177
00:16:45,537 --> 00:16:47,239
He can get away with anything.

178
00:16:48,974 --> 00:16:50,042
Master Ramos!

179
00:16:50,876 --> 00:16:51,877
Sir.

180
00:16:53,479 --> 00:16:54,480
What is it?

181
00:16:55,981 --> 00:16:57,750
What? Just say it!

182
00:16:59,952 --> 00:17:01,787
Sir, I overheard Colonel Garcia.

183
00:17:02,988 --> 00:17:05,424
He threatened Big Boss
that he can get dismissed from service

184
00:17:05,491 --> 00:17:06,992
because he has a connection in the PRG.

185
00:17:07,059 --> 00:17:08,293
-What?
-What?

186
00:17:11,063 --> 00:17:14,600
I have a feeling
Colonel Garcia already knows about this.

187
00:17:14,666 --> 00:17:16,402
That's why I'm scared.

188
00:17:17,836 --> 00:17:20,739
They might suspect me for a rebel.

189
00:17:22,074 --> 00:17:23,075
And you.

190
00:17:24,109 --> 00:17:27,780
You might get involved.
They might do something to you.

191
00:17:30,649 --> 00:17:32,217
Nothing will happen to me, Maxine.

192
00:17:32,284 --> 00:17:33,719
Are you sure?

193
00:17:37,423 --> 00:17:39,558
What if they find out the truth?

194
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:42,628
<i>Are you obligated to tell them?</i>

195
00:17:42,694 --> 00:17:45,497
Listen to me, I will protect you.

196
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:47,933
Just don't say anything.
I will take care of everything.

197
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,268
I have a plan.

198
00:17:50,869 --> 00:17:55,040
Maxine, don't ever mention Bullet or Rodel
while in the camp.

199
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:56,675
Just do as I say.

200
00:17:57,476 --> 00:17:58,477
This is for you.

201
00:17:59,311 --> 00:18:01,780
Doc, are you okay?

202
00:18:04,016 --> 00:18:06,118
-Lucas needs me.
-Hold on.

203
00:18:06,185 --> 00:18:07,553
Don't interfere.

204
00:18:08,353 --> 00:18:09,888
Lucas needs me there.

205
00:18:09,955 --> 00:18:11,056
I will go see him.

206
00:18:17,196 --> 00:18:18,597
If I were you, Manalo…

207
00:18:19,865 --> 00:18:23,635
I'll speak now so I won't get in trouble.

208
00:18:28,373 --> 00:18:29,908
If you know something…

209
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:32,878
no matter who's involved…

210
00:18:33,979 --> 00:18:34,980
just say it.

211
00:18:52,064 --> 00:18:54,766
This is none of your business.
Don't interfere.

212
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:57,369
You don't understand, Diego.

213
00:18:59,037 --> 00:19:01,740
Stop protecting your doctor girlfriend.

214
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:09,548
Is she more important
than all your hard work and training?

215
00:19:11,049 --> 00:19:14,253
All the years in the field
and in the academy?

216
00:19:17,689 --> 00:19:19,291
You've been a soldier for a long time.

217
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:22,361
You are the leader of the Alpha Team.

218
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:28,800
Will you allow your name
and your reputation be destroyed?

219
00:19:42,881 --> 00:19:44,383
-Doc Maxine.
-No!

220
00:19:49,988 --> 00:19:53,692
I won't allow Lucas to turn his back
on his sworn duty just because of me.

221
00:19:56,828 --> 00:19:58,096
He is innocent.

222
00:19:58,964 --> 00:20:00,632
Rodel dela Cruz is my brother.

223
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:02,568
You know him as Bullet.

224
00:20:03,969 --> 00:20:05,537
He is the leader of the PRG.

225
00:20:31,763 --> 00:20:33,398
Thank you for defending me, Lucas,

226
00:20:33,465 --> 00:20:36,235
but I won't allow your integrity
to be ruined because of this.

227
00:20:36,301 --> 00:20:37,302
Because of me.

228
00:20:40,572 --> 00:20:42,507
I can't do that to the person I love.

229
00:20:43,508 --> 00:20:46,979
So you know all about this?
That Bullet is her brother?

230
00:20:55,354 --> 00:20:57,189
But he found out only just now.

231
00:20:59,725 --> 00:21:02,127
They saw each other in the PRG camp.

232
00:21:02,628 --> 00:21:04,863
They almost killed each other,
but I was able to stop them.

233
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:17,242
I will answer all your questions instead.

234
00:21:19,077 --> 00:21:21,913
I'm not hiding anything
and I'm not doing anything wrong.

235
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:26,818
Aside from almost putting
an honorable man in danger…

236
00:21:28,787 --> 00:21:31,356
he almost lost everything because of me.

237
00:21:32,591 --> 00:21:34,293
And I cannot allow that to happen.

238
00:21:38,363 --> 00:21:39,564
Where are you going?

239
00:21:39,631 --> 00:21:43,769
Sir, let's let them talk.
They will not try to escape.

240
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:50,609
Maxine, why did you do that?

241
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:53,345
I can handle myself.

242
00:21:53,412 --> 00:21:54,413
I know!

243
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:57,449
But I can handle myself, too.
Just trust me.

244
00:22:01,653 --> 00:22:03,555
You saw what I did inside.

245
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:06,224
I'm so brave, right?

246
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:13,031
I've been admiring you for a long time.

247
00:22:16,868 --> 00:22:21,340
Maxine, I will not let you go, okay?

248
00:22:21,406 --> 00:22:23,208
You will not die.
I will get you out of here.

249
00:22:23,275 --> 00:22:25,010
Lucas, what are you doing?

250
00:22:30,916 --> 00:22:33,919
<i>How would you know who to save?</i>

251
00:22:33,985 --> 00:22:37,956
<i>In the face of danger,
you really need to make a decision.</i>

252
00:22:38,457 --> 00:22:40,926
As a leader,
that is what's expected of me.

253
00:22:40,992 --> 00:22:42,427
To make a decision.

254
00:22:42,494 --> 00:22:45,163
How would you know
if your decision is right?

255
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:46,965
You just need to stand by it.

256
00:22:47,466 --> 00:22:49,968
You have to face
whatever the consequences may be.

257
00:22:52,971 --> 00:22:54,406
Are you not scared?

258
00:22:54,473 --> 00:22:56,641
I can't show people I'm scared.

259
00:22:58,176 --> 00:22:59,444
Especially to my men.

260
00:22:59,511 --> 00:23:00,746
You know what, Maxine?

261
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:03,982
You are blinded by your love for that man.

262
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:05,851
That's why he deserves to die!

263
00:23:15,794 --> 00:23:17,262
But you know, Lucas?

264
00:23:19,364 --> 00:23:22,234
I just learned how to be brave.

265
00:23:23,502 --> 00:23:28,106
Before, I was just pretending to be brave
to protect myself.

266
00:23:30,041 --> 00:23:32,778
But I have learned
that defending other people…

267
00:23:33,712 --> 00:23:35,847
especially those you love…

268
00:23:37,382 --> 00:23:38,884
That's what courage truly is.

269
00:23:51,797 --> 00:23:53,598
Lucas, I can handle everything…

270
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:56,768
as long as you're okay.

271
00:23:59,471 --> 00:24:01,940
Can I have a hug for some courage?

272
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:32,537
Just let us.

273
00:25:30,262 --> 00:25:32,163
I wonder what Doc Maxine did this time.

274
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:35,700
She is troublesome.
The colonel probably got fed up with her.

275
00:25:35,767 --> 00:25:37,936
-That's not it.
-Why? What do you know?

276
00:25:38,003 --> 00:25:39,738
<i>Your brother is alive?</i>

277
00:25:39,804 --> 00:25:41,940
<i>I want to see your brother.</i>

278
00:25:42,007 --> 00:25:44,676
Mom, it's difficult to go to him.

279
00:25:44,743 --> 00:25:48,179
He is in Mount Kalasangan.

280
00:25:48,246 --> 00:25:49,814
<i>There are rebels there, right?</i>

281
00:25:49,881 --> 00:25:52,083
Mom, the thing is…

282
00:25:52,150 --> 00:25:56,321
It's difficult to overpower feelings,
especially when it comes to family.

283
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:58,089
Are you and Diego still not okay?

284
00:25:58,156 --> 00:26:02,093
We talked already
and he asked for my forgiveness.

285
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:05,263
I don't know if he can separate
his feelings for me

286
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:07,132
from what happened
between the two of you, Dad.

287
00:26:07,198 --> 00:26:09,768
I'm leaving Urdan.
I'm going back to Manila.

288
00:26:09,834 --> 00:26:11,903
Hold on. You don't have to do that.

289
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:13,438
You don't have to do that.
