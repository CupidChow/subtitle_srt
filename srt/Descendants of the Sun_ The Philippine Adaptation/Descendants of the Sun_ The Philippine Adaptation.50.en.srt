1
00:00:11,244 --> 00:00:13,580
Well, based on our observation,

2
00:00:13,646 --> 00:00:16,716
it's possible that he is also infected
with the toxin released in the Medicube.

3
00:00:16,783 --> 00:00:21,254
You have to come with us
to the Medicube for observation.

4
00:00:21,321 --> 00:00:22,155
<i>Yes, of course.</i>

5
00:00:22,222 --> 00:00:25,125
We will not turn our backs
on anyone who needs help.

6
00:00:25,191 --> 00:00:27,994
But of course, once he's here
we need to talk to him

7
00:00:28,061 --> 00:00:30,964
to confirm if he is a
member of PRG or not.

8
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:33,767
Once we confirm
that he is really a member of PRG,

9
00:00:33,833 --> 00:00:35,869
I'm sorry but he will be imprisoned.

10
00:00:37,971 --> 00:00:39,039
Harry Potter.

11
00:00:39,105 --> 00:00:40,974
I will also report to Captain Manalo.

12
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:43,243
We'll be outside if you need anything.

13
00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:50,850
Big Boss, it looks like
we need backup here.

14
00:00:50,917 --> 00:00:51,818
Why?

15
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:55,355
I think Doc Maxine didn't
help just an ordinary rebel.

16
00:00:55,422 --> 00:00:58,158
He is the leader of PRG we
are looking for, Big Boss.

17
00:00:58,224 --> 00:00:59,459
It's Bullet.

18
00:00:59,526 --> 00:01:00,794
My brother.

19
00:01:01,394 --> 00:01:03,196
<i>Be careful with your actions.</i>

20
00:01:03,263 --> 00:01:06,199
This may be our only
chance to capture Bullet.

21
00:01:06,266 --> 00:01:08,001
He cannot escape this time.

22
00:01:09,102 --> 00:01:10,437
You can count on us.

23
00:01:13,873 --> 00:01:15,675
Brother, it's me.

24
00:01:17,343 --> 00:01:19,479
What's your plan if we capture Bullet?

25
00:01:19,546 --> 00:01:23,283
He will pay for all his sins
especially for what he did to my father.

26
00:01:23,349 --> 00:01:25,452
Maxine, they are sending people away.

27
00:01:25,518 --> 00:01:27,687
We need to move some patients.

28
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:29,689
We don't want others to get infected.

29
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:31,191
That's just safety precaution, Rodel.

30
00:01:31,658 --> 00:01:33,860
No. They've recognized me.

31
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:35,228
They know I'm here.

32
00:01:37,564 --> 00:01:38,932
You're a rebel?

33
00:01:38,998 --> 00:01:41,501
<i>My enemies cannot see me here.</i>

34
00:01:41,568 --> 00:01:44,437
The soldiers are not enemies.
They are our allies.

35
00:01:44,504 --> 00:01:46,673
Maxine, you don't know
what you're talking about.

36
00:01:46,739 --> 00:01:48,041
Maxine?

37
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:49,309
Maxine?

38
00:02:10,697 --> 00:02:11,531
Where is he?

39
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:13,867
Where did he go?

40
00:02:34,487 --> 00:02:36,856
Search for him by the river.

41
00:02:36,923 --> 00:02:39,626
Make sure he doesn't
cross to the other town.

42
00:02:39,692 --> 00:02:40,860
He can't escape.

43
00:02:58,745 --> 00:02:59,746
Maxine?

44
00:03:05,418 --> 00:03:06,252
Maxine?

45
00:03:19,132 --> 00:03:20,400
Did he hurt you?

46
00:03:21,935 --> 00:03:24,537
Don't worry, we will catch him.

47
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:53,566
Big Boss.

48
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:56,803
The area is cleared.

49
00:03:57,971 --> 00:03:59,138
Bullet escaped.

50
00:05:22,388 --> 00:05:23,890
Hands up.

51
00:05:40,773 --> 00:05:43,976
This can't be happening to us.

52
00:06:50,543 --> 00:06:53,246
Rodel, what really happened to you?

53
00:06:53,312 --> 00:06:55,681
How did you get your wounds?

54
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:57,717
My comrades double-crossed me.

55
00:06:57,784 --> 00:06:58,851
What?

56
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:00,787
I'll explain next time.

57
00:07:00,853 --> 00:07:02,388
I need to get out of here.

58
00:07:02,455 --> 00:07:04,557
I need to take you to the Medicube.

59
00:07:04,624 --> 00:07:06,125
You are not well yet.

60
00:07:07,693 --> 00:07:08,828
Just let me be.

61
00:07:09,595 --> 00:07:12,064
The enemies cannot see me here.

62
00:07:12,131 --> 00:07:13,966
The soldiers are not enemies.

63
00:07:14,033 --> 00:07:15,334
They are our allies.

64
00:07:15,401 --> 00:07:17,837
Maxine, you don't know
what you're talking about.

65
00:07:19,172 --> 00:07:22,575
Rodel, my brother, please.

66
00:07:22,642 --> 00:07:24,010
Let me get out of here.

67
00:07:33,553 --> 00:07:34,954
Maxine, let me leave.

68
00:07:35,021 --> 00:07:37,290
Brother, what's with you?

69
00:07:37,356 --> 00:07:39,525
What? You're leaving again?

70
00:07:39,592 --> 00:07:42,128
You will leave me again?
You will leave me again?

71
00:07:42,195 --> 00:07:43,463
What do you want?

72
00:07:43,529 --> 00:07:45,898
-For the soldiers to kill me?
-They will not kill you.

73
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:47,567
You don't know what you're talking about.

74
00:07:52,004 --> 00:07:56,008
If you still consider me as your brother,
let's meet in the forest tonight.

75
00:07:57,410 --> 00:08:00,246
When you cross the river,
you will find a hut.

76
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:01,714
I will explain everything to you.

77
00:08:01,781 --> 00:08:04,784
But don't tell anyone
that I'm still alive, especially mom.

78
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:07,887
Brother!

79
00:08:08,387 --> 00:08:10,490
Rodel! Brother!

80
00:08:36,515 --> 00:08:37,483
Secure them.

81
00:08:38,417 --> 00:08:40,186
Secure the medical team. Secure them.

82
00:08:40,253 --> 00:08:41,354
Are you trying to escape?

83
00:08:45,591 --> 00:08:47,326
We will get you out of here.

84
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:49,929
Marty!

85
00:08:49,996 --> 00:08:51,797
That's enough!

86
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:57,169
Let them be, Rodel. Let them go!

87
00:08:57,236 --> 00:08:59,272
I need a human shield. Give her to me.

88
00:09:09,315 --> 00:09:10,149
Maxine?

89
00:09:20,293 --> 00:09:22,161
Is this the rebel you saw earlier?

90
00:09:31,971 --> 00:09:35,942
He is Bullet,
the notorious leader of the PRG.

91
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:48,387
Is he the one who crippled your father?

92
00:09:48,454 --> 00:09:50,189
He did not only cripple my father,

93
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:53,693
he almost killed him.

94
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:05,438
Just go and save yourself.

95
00:10:05,504 --> 00:10:06,772
Save yourself.

96
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:16,415
Save yourself.

97
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:19,719
Dad. Dad!

98
00:10:19,785 --> 00:10:23,589
I'm sorry I'm a burden to you.

99
00:10:23,656 --> 00:10:25,458
There you go again.

100
00:10:25,524 --> 00:10:26,559
Don't say that.

101
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:29,128
We want to take care of you.

102
00:10:29,195 --> 00:10:30,696
We love you so much.

103
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:34,834
You don't have to look after me.

104
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:40,573
What you have to do
Lucas, is to defeat the PRG.

105
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:44,543
Because of what he did,
our lives turned upside down.

106
00:10:47,413 --> 00:10:49,615
That's why I made a promise to my father,

107
00:10:50,716 --> 00:10:55,788
that I'll do everything
to capture this person.

108
00:11:06,265 --> 00:11:07,566
Lucas, there's something…

109
00:11:10,636 --> 00:11:12,538
there's something I need to tell you.

110
00:11:22,748 --> 00:11:23,749
What…

111
00:11:25,317 --> 00:11:26,619
what do you need to tell me?

112
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:36,062
I want to tell you that…

113
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:37,530
That?

114
00:11:43,169 --> 00:11:45,571
That I'm always here for you.

115
00:12:02,421 --> 00:12:03,589
Thank you, Maxine.

116
00:12:08,928 --> 00:12:11,864
You're the only one
who gives me strength right now.

117
00:12:15,634 --> 00:12:18,204
Because most of the time, I feel like…

118
00:12:22,808 --> 00:12:24,110
I'm a failure.

119
00:12:26,445 --> 00:12:27,513
That's why..

120
00:12:29,615 --> 00:12:34,754
I promised my dad
that I will seek revenge for him.

121
00:12:36,055 --> 00:12:38,124
I will seek revenge for my family.

122
00:12:38,991 --> 00:12:40,659
But until now, there's nothing.

123
00:12:42,661 --> 00:12:44,363
I haven't done anything.

124
00:12:56,809 --> 00:13:01,247
Lucas, just a hypothetical question.

125
00:13:03,816 --> 00:13:05,217
What if…

126
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:13,859
Bullet changed his ways

127
00:13:13,926 --> 00:13:15,561
and ask for your forgiveness?

128
00:13:19,198 --> 00:13:20,533
Will you forgive him?

129
00:13:32,745 --> 00:13:36,148
He left a deep wound in my family.

130
00:13:38,217 --> 00:13:39,752
He's not only a rebel.

131
00:13:41,554 --> 00:13:43,389
He is a terrorist.

132
00:13:46,358 --> 00:13:49,628
They are all evil.

133
00:14:12,418 --> 00:14:13,485
Sergeant Ramos.

134
00:14:18,624 --> 00:14:19,992
Can I talk to you?

135
00:14:21,927 --> 00:14:23,662
Sir, if this is about the mission,

136
00:14:23,729 --> 00:14:25,531
we failed to capture Bullet.

137
00:14:31,303 --> 00:14:35,975
General, with all due respect,

138
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:38,711
but I refuse to talk about my
personal problems.

139
00:14:45,751 --> 00:14:47,586
I know how mad you are at me.

140
00:14:50,155 --> 00:14:52,324
I can't undo what happened to your mother,

141
00:14:53,092 --> 00:14:55,394
and I will regret that
for the rest of my life.

142
00:14:56,295 --> 00:14:59,832
I understand if you cannot forgive me.

143
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:07,239
But please, Moira should not be the one
paying for my sins.

144
00:15:54,019 --> 00:15:55,154
Maxine?

145
00:15:56,188 --> 00:15:57,389
Brother.

146
00:16:23,515 --> 00:16:24,683
Hi.

147
00:16:25,751 --> 00:16:28,153
-Hi.
-It looks like you're in a hurry.

148
00:16:28,921 --> 00:16:30,155
Where are you going?

149
00:16:31,156 --> 00:16:34,827
I'm going to Sitio Santos
to see Miss Sheila.

150
00:16:34,893 --> 00:16:36,829
I need to bring some medicines.

151
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:39,064
Do you want me to come with you?

152
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:44,536
I'll just ask Nurse Hazel to do it.

153
00:16:44,603 --> 00:16:46,271
I just remembered.
I still have work to do.

154
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:47,172
Excuse me.

155
00:16:52,378 --> 00:16:53,412
Hi, mommy.

156
00:16:53,479 --> 00:16:54,680
<i>Good thing you called.</i>

157
00:17:00,619 --> 00:17:01,954
<i>What's the problem?</i>

158
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:04,423
<i>Did you and Lucas fight?</i>

159
00:17:05,157 --> 00:17:06,759
<i>Did he hurt you?</i>

160
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:10,362
No. Lucas and I are okay, mommy.

161
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,569
<i>I know very well
if you're going through something.</i>

162
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:25,544
If you still consider me as your brother,
let's meet in the forest tonight.

163
00:17:27,379 --> 00:17:29,982
When you cross the river,
you will find a hut.

164
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:31,617
I will explain everything to you.

165
00:17:31,683 --> 00:17:34,520
But don't tell anyone
that I'm still alive, especially mom.

166
00:17:36,688 --> 00:17:43,629
Mom, what if you find
out that brother is alive?

167
00:17:46,965 --> 00:17:48,567
<i>Why do you ask?</i>

168
00:17:54,773 --> 00:17:59,011
<i>Maxine, don't make things hard
for yourself.</i>

169
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:05,684
<i>We have to accept
that your brother is gone.</i>

170
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:09,154
<i>But that doesn't mean
he's no longer in our hearts.</i>

171
00:18:10,689 --> 00:18:14,927
<i>At some point in our lives,
we have to move on</i>

172
00:18:14,993 --> 00:18:17,729
<i>because that's the only way
we can be happy.</i>

173
00:18:26,305 --> 00:18:29,908
I have to go, mom.
I think someone called for me.

174
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:37,216
<i>I love you, my child.</i>

175
00:18:51,897 --> 00:18:54,266
The young rebel is still unconscious, sir.

176
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:57,236
Once he wakes up,
I will interrogate him myself.

177
00:18:57,302 --> 00:19:00,439
Why do you think Bullet is wounded?

178
00:19:00,506 --> 00:19:04,076
Sir, we suspect that he got into a fight
with someone in their group.

179
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:08,113
If that's the case, that only means
there's a faction in their group.

180
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:11,550
Do you think Bullet left the PRG?

181
00:19:11,617 --> 00:19:14,153
We are not sure, sir.
But we will find out.

182
00:19:14,219 --> 00:19:18,557
Because we can easily bring them down
while they are having internal problems.

183
00:20:04,069 --> 00:20:06,238
It's really a good morning
because I'm with you,

184
00:20:06,305 --> 00:20:07,906
Captain Moira Defensor.

185
00:20:12,477 --> 00:20:14,746
There is a delicious
pastry in the canteen.

186
00:20:14,813 --> 00:20:16,348
Let's see who is faster.

187
00:20:16,415 --> 00:20:19,084
Whoever loses will pay.

188
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:46,245
Just add soda with the pastry.

189
00:22:15,233 --> 00:22:16,935
Is this him?

190
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:18,837
Is he the man who hurt my mother?

191
00:22:19,504 --> 00:22:22,841
But Dad and I just talked
and he said he was okay about us, right?

192
00:22:22,908 --> 00:22:25,844
He said I will be happier once you return.

193
00:22:27,512 --> 00:22:28,947
What's the problem, Diego?

194
00:22:29,014 --> 00:22:30,816
This is not an order from your father.

195
00:22:32,751 --> 00:22:33,985
This is my own decision.

196
00:22:56,608 --> 00:22:57,776
Diego?

197
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:09,221
What are you doing here?

198
00:23:11,523 --> 00:23:13,425
I just want to check your condition.

199
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:24,102
I thought you don't care about me anymore.

200
00:23:26,805 --> 00:23:28,306
You broke up with me, right?

201
00:23:34,546 --> 00:23:36,081
I thought you're brave.

202
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:42,754
But you can't even tell me
why you broke up with me.

203
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:49,628
Diego, I don't need your apology.

204
00:23:52,697 --> 00:23:54,433
I don't need you here.

205
00:23:56,201 --> 00:23:57,169
Get out.

206
00:23:58,336 --> 00:23:59,471
Get out.

207
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:01,273
Diego…

208
00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:04,009
-Diego, get out.
-Moira?

209
00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:07,279
-Get out, Diego.
-Moira!

210
00:24:08,346 --> 00:24:09,181
Help!

211
00:24:09,748 --> 00:24:11,516
Help, medical team!

212
00:24:11,583 --> 00:24:12,884
Moira, Moira!

213
00:24:14,486 --> 00:24:15,654
Help! Help!

214
00:24:16,154 --> 00:24:17,422
She is fainting.

215
00:24:19,925 --> 00:24:21,726
We'll take care of her, sir.

216
00:24:22,194 --> 00:24:24,796
-Will she be okay?
-We'll do everything we can.

217
00:24:32,604 --> 00:24:33,438
Doc Earl.

218
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:36,908
Her blood pressure is dropping.

219
00:24:38,443 --> 00:24:39,411
Moira?

220
00:24:47,352 --> 00:24:49,554
Where is Doc Maxine? We need her help.

221
00:24:49,621 --> 00:24:52,023
Nurse Emma is already looking for her.
I'll follow her up.

222
00:24:52,924 --> 00:24:54,960
Moira, my child…

223
00:25:05,704 --> 00:25:06,805
Rodel?

224
00:25:14,212 --> 00:25:15,313
Brother?

225
00:25:32,931 --> 00:25:34,132
It's me, Maxine.

226
00:25:35,233 --> 00:25:37,869
Be quiet. Those traitors might hear us.

227
00:25:37,936 --> 00:25:38,870
It's dangerous.

228
00:26:08,166 --> 00:26:10,235
What's important is I have
full control of the PRG

229
00:26:10,302 --> 00:26:11,937
and no one can take it away from me.

230
00:26:12,003 --> 00:26:14,272
I will finish what I started.

231
00:26:14,339 --> 00:26:15,640
Bullet!

232
00:26:15,707 --> 00:26:17,008
Who is he?

233
00:26:17,075 --> 00:26:18,743
Maxine, why did you
bring someone with you?

234
00:26:18,810 --> 00:26:21,713
-No, brother.
-Why are you talking to a rebel?

235
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:24,649
I'm your older brother but you
listen more to those soldiers.

236
00:26:24,716 --> 00:26:27,352
Whether you like it or not,
you are now a member of the PRG

237
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:29,087
and you can no longer return to your camp.

238
00:26:29,154 --> 00:26:31,990
Captain Lucas,
there's something I need to tell you.

239
00:26:32,057 --> 00:26:32,891
What is it?

240
00:26:32,958 --> 00:26:34,793
We have another camp
that you don't know about.

241
00:26:34,859 --> 00:26:36,494
Maybe our fellow rebels are still there.

242
00:26:36,561 --> 00:26:37,395
Where is it?

243
00:26:44,469 --> 00:26:45,904
This is your end.
