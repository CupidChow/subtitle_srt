1
00:00:11,745 --> 00:00:12,879
It doesn't hurt right now.

2
00:00:14,381 --> 00:00:17,217
How about with Colonel Garcia?
Can you handle him?

3
00:00:17,283 --> 00:00:18,918
Lucas, he is very mad at you.

4
00:00:18,985 --> 00:00:21,488
And it seems he is serious
in punishing you.

5
00:00:21,554 --> 00:00:23,356
<i>Moira, forgive me.</i>

6
00:00:23,423 --> 00:00:25,358
<i>Forgive me if I let go of your hands.</i>

7
00:00:25,425 --> 00:00:27,761
I will never do that again.

8
00:00:28,261 --> 00:00:32,866
I hope you can give me another chance
to show you how much I love you.

9
00:00:33,466 --> 00:00:36,903
Now, tell me why you went to the PRG camp?

10
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:39,372
I already told you the reason, Colonel.

11
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:41,041
I don't believe you.

12
00:00:43,109 --> 00:00:46,479
Sir, please don't pick on Maxine.
This is my responsibility.

13
00:00:46,546 --> 00:00:47,680
I will answer for this.

14
00:00:47,747 --> 00:00:49,015
You dare answer back!

15
00:00:53,586 --> 00:00:55,255
Let's talk.

16
00:00:55,321 --> 00:00:56,956
<i>Sir, I overheard Colonel Garcia.</i>

17
00:00:57,023 --> 00:00:59,325
He threatened Big Boss
that he can get dismissed

18
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:00,894
because he has a connection in the PRG.

19
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,362
-What?
-What?

20
00:01:02,429 --> 00:01:03,596
Lucas needs me.

21
00:01:03,663 --> 00:01:07,934
If I were you, Manalo,
I'll speak now so I won't get in trouble.

22
00:01:08,001 --> 00:01:10,103
Maxine, this is none of your business.

23
00:01:10,603 --> 00:01:11,638
Don't interfere.

24
00:01:11,704 --> 00:01:13,973
Stop protecting your doctor girlfriend.

25
00:01:15,875 --> 00:01:17,577
Thank you for defending me, Lucas.

26
00:01:17,644 --> 00:01:20,113
But I won't allow your integrity
to be ruined because of this.

27
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:22,282
I can't do that to the person I love.

28
00:01:22,348 --> 00:01:25,285
So you know all about this?
That Bullet is her brother?

29
00:01:26,252 --> 00:01:28,588
I will answer all your questions instead.

30
00:01:28,655 --> 00:01:31,224
I'm not hiding anything
and I'm not doing anything wrong.

31
00:01:33,593 --> 00:01:34,961
Where are you going?

32
00:01:35,028 --> 00:01:38,565
Sir, let's let them talk.
They will not try to escape.

33
00:01:43,636 --> 00:01:45,905
Maxine, why did you do that?

34
00:01:47,273 --> 00:01:48,575
I can handle myself.

35
00:01:48,641 --> 00:01:49,776
I know!

36
00:01:50,443 --> 00:01:52,679
But I can handle myself, too.
Just trust me.

37
00:01:56,983 --> 00:01:58,585
You saw what I did inside.

38
00:02:00,053 --> 00:02:01,054
I'm so brave, right?

39
00:02:06,493 --> 00:02:08,094
I've been admiring you for a long time.

40
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:12,398
But you know, Lucas?

41
00:02:14,534 --> 00:02:17,470
I just learned how to be brave.

42
00:02:18,571 --> 00:02:23,243
Before, I was just pretending to be brave
to protect myself.

43
00:02:25,178 --> 00:02:27,914
But I have learned
that defending other people…

44
00:02:28,882 --> 00:02:30,717
especially those you love…

45
00:02:32,452 --> 00:02:33,987
That's what courage truly is.

46
00:02:46,933 --> 00:02:48,735
Lucas, I can handle everything…

47
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:52,105
as long as you're okay.

48
00:02:54,407 --> 00:02:56,943
Can I have a hug for some courage?

49
00:03:26,673 --> 00:03:28,007
Just let us.

50
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:45,151
Wow.

51
00:04:45,985 --> 00:04:48,187
I still can't believe it, Big Boss.

52
00:04:48,855 --> 00:04:50,957
The person who hurt your father…

53
00:04:52,225 --> 00:04:54,427
turned out to be Doc Maxine's brother.

54
00:04:58,064 --> 00:05:01,267
Moira and I are not the only ones
being tricked by fate.

55
00:05:03,703 --> 00:05:05,438
We talked about it already.

56
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:08,875
We will overcome this.

57
00:05:09,409 --> 00:05:12,745
We promised not to keep any more secrets.

58
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:14,547
We will help each other.

59
00:05:22,055 --> 00:05:25,658
What my mom and I know
is that my brother is already dead.

60
00:05:28,561 --> 00:05:29,696
<i>He was a former soldier.</i>

61
00:05:29,762 --> 00:05:34,734
<i>We were told that he died in an encounter,
but we never really saw his body.</i>

62
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:39,839
I've always believed
that my brother is still alive, but…

63
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:43,343
I never thought we'd find each other
here in Urdan.

64
00:05:44,544 --> 00:05:47,380
So how long have you been in contact
with your brother?

65
00:05:48,381 --> 00:05:50,249
Just recently.

66
00:05:56,923 --> 00:06:00,793
We first met when we were on our way
to Sitio Santos.

67
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:01,928
We saw him.

68
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:04,997
Rodel.

69
00:06:13,106 --> 00:06:15,408
But I never thought he is Bullet.

70
00:06:18,678 --> 00:06:20,313
The leader of the rebels.

71
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,281
My comrades betrayed me.

72
00:06:22,348 --> 00:06:23,416
What?

73
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:26,619
I'll explain everything some other time.
I need to get out of here.

74
00:06:26,686 --> 00:06:28,087
I need to take you to the Medicube.

75
00:06:28,154 --> 00:06:30,757
My enemies cannot catch me here.

76
00:06:30,823 --> 00:06:34,026
The soldiers are not enemies.
They are allies.

77
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:36,963
Maxine, you don't know
what you're talking about.

78
00:06:37,029 --> 00:06:38,798
Why didn't you tell us right away?

79
00:06:39,332 --> 00:06:41,134
Because you were protecting him?

80
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:44,270
Because you have also joined the PRG?

81
00:06:44,704 --> 00:06:45,705
No.

82
00:06:46,806 --> 00:06:48,908
I'm not a PRG member.

83
00:06:48,975 --> 00:06:51,277
Whether you like it or not,
you are now a member of the PRG.

84
00:06:51,344 --> 00:06:53,413
You can no longer go back to your camp!

85
00:06:53,479 --> 00:06:54,847
What do you want from me?

86
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:56,616
You're a valuable asset to the group.

87
00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:00,887
-We need a doctor in the camp.
-That's not possible!

88
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:04,624
Most of all, I'm not a spy.

89
00:07:07,994 --> 00:07:10,997
I'm protecting him
because he is my older brother.

90
00:07:11,497 --> 00:07:13,633
What other tasks
did your brother give you?

91
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:17,503
Did he ask you to find out
about our plans here

92
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:19,372
so you can divulge it to the PRG?

93
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:22,642
Is that why you got into a relationship
with Captain Manalo?

94
00:07:23,743 --> 00:07:24,744
What?

95
00:07:29,415 --> 00:07:30,416
<i>How?</i>

96
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:32,685
You are the leader of the Alpha Team,

97
00:07:32,752 --> 00:07:35,721
and the brother of your girlfriend
is the leader of the rebels.

98
00:07:35,788 --> 00:07:36,989
What are you going to do now?

99
00:07:38,891 --> 00:07:40,426
You already know everything?

100
00:07:41,761 --> 00:07:44,197
Nurse Hazel, you know it, too?

101
00:07:45,765 --> 00:07:47,166
Even the whole medical team knows?

102
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:50,403
I'm the only one who knows.

103
00:07:51,337 --> 00:07:53,739
But now that the military knows…

104
00:07:54,874 --> 00:07:56,476
will she be punished?

105
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:59,612
Is that the reason why Colonel Garcia
is talking to her?

106
00:08:01,447 --> 00:08:04,183
They are just asking her some questions.

107
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:06,219
If they need a witness, I can be one.

108
00:08:06,919 --> 00:08:09,589
I will prove that Doc Maxine
didn't do anything wrong.

109
00:08:10,556 --> 00:08:12,892
She urged her brother to surrender,

110
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:15,795
but he threatened to kill himself
in front of Doc Maxine.

111
00:08:15,862 --> 00:08:18,264
Of course, Doc Maxine had no choice.

112
00:08:18,865 --> 00:08:20,867
I really pity her.

113
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:23,803
She was so confused.

114
00:08:25,471 --> 00:08:27,707
Her brother is really very scary.

115
00:08:36,916 --> 00:08:38,017
Admit it, Doc.

116
00:08:39,085 --> 00:08:42,455
You got into a relationship
with the leader of the Alpha Team

117
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:47,827
to have access and gain information
through him.

118
00:08:50,096 --> 00:08:51,564
That's not true.

119
00:08:54,634 --> 00:08:55,968
I love Lucas.

120
00:08:56,636 --> 00:09:01,507
And I don't know anything
about whatever it is you're saying.

121
00:09:01,574 --> 00:09:04,777
I'm not part of the PRG. I'm not a spy.

122
00:09:05,912 --> 00:09:08,514
I'm only protecting Bullet
because he is my brother.

123
00:09:10,316 --> 00:09:11,350
I admit.

124
00:09:13,586 --> 00:09:17,390
Before I came here to Urdan,
I was angry towards soldiers.

125
00:09:20,026 --> 00:09:22,061
My brother died because of you soldiers.

126
00:09:23,462 --> 00:09:24,463
But now…

127
00:09:25,665 --> 00:09:28,768
Ever since I've been with Lucas
and the Alpha Team,

128
00:09:28,834 --> 00:09:30,770
my perception about soldiers changed.

129
00:09:58,030 --> 00:10:00,166
<i>Now, I understand the military better.</i>

130
00:10:01,667 --> 00:10:04,003
And I learned to respect your work more.

131
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:08,908
If that is true, Doctor,
then you won't hesitate to join us.

132
00:10:14,547 --> 00:10:19,118
You can help us in our military efforts
to defeat the rebels.

133
00:10:19,185 --> 00:10:22,989
You can be our asset inside the PRG.

134
00:10:25,091 --> 00:10:26,325
Are you serious?

135
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:31,497
Well, if you won't betray your brother,
you will betray your country.

136
00:10:32,832 --> 00:10:34,000
You've gone too far.

137
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:39,138
If you protect your brother…

138
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:42,942
it's like you're supporting
their terrorizing here in Urdan…

139
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:45,478
harming people…

140
00:10:46,245 --> 00:10:48,180
and the killing of soldiers.

141
00:10:49,248 --> 00:10:51,050
Soldiers like the man you love.

142
00:10:52,451 --> 00:10:53,519
Can you take that?

143
00:10:55,888 --> 00:10:57,523
You need to choose.

144
00:10:58,824 --> 00:11:01,894
Don't think
that you're betraying your brother.

145
00:11:03,229 --> 00:11:06,065
The truth is, you'll be saving him.

146
00:11:07,299 --> 00:11:09,869
If we let the PRG continue…

147
00:11:10,936 --> 00:11:13,606
Bullet will harm even more people.

148
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:17,677
And the cases against him will pile up.

149
00:11:19,078 --> 00:11:21,647
And the military will have no choice,

150
00:11:21,714 --> 00:11:24,583
but to increase operations
against the PRG.

151
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:30,256
And surely, your brother will likely die
in an encounter.

152
00:11:30,322 --> 00:11:36,295
But it will not come to that
if you help us catch him.

153
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:54,280
You don't have to answer now.

154
00:11:56,248 --> 00:11:58,050
You should think about it carefully.

155
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:00,886
But…

156
00:12:29,181 --> 00:12:31,851
We have known Doc Maxine for a long time.

157
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:35,287
We know she will not join the rebels.

158
00:12:35,354 --> 00:12:36,489
That's right.

159
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:40,559
Even though her brother
is the leader of the PRG,

160
00:12:40,626 --> 00:12:42,394
Doc Maxine is a different person, right?

161
00:12:42,461 --> 00:12:43,462
Of course.

162
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:46,932
We will protect Doc Maxine if needed.

163
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:48,634
Wait a second.

164
00:12:49,235 --> 00:12:52,705
You mean the one who kidnapped us
is Doc Maxine's brother?

165
00:12:55,541 --> 00:12:59,678
Are you really on my side
or are you just gossiping about me?

166
00:12:59,745 --> 00:13:01,714
Of course we are on your side.

167
00:13:02,181 --> 00:13:05,284
But this twist of fate
is really unbelievable.

168
00:13:06,152 --> 00:13:07,319
I don't know.

169
00:13:08,387 --> 00:13:11,724
Maybe I should be happy
because I already found my brother

170
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:13,325
and I've confirmed he's alive.

171
00:13:14,059 --> 00:13:17,429
But… it's difficult.

172
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:19,031
Why, Doc?

173
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:20,800
What did they do to you?

174
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:23,269
Did the soldiers get angry?

175
00:13:31,076 --> 00:13:33,512
Talledo, can you check if it's hot.

176
00:13:37,049 --> 00:13:39,485
Talledo, is it already boiling?

177
00:13:40,085 --> 00:13:41,620
Just a little more time, sir.

178
00:13:43,689 --> 00:13:46,625
<i>All units, keep a close watch
on Doctor Dela Cruz.</i>

179
00:13:46,692 --> 00:13:48,794
<i>Report to me if she goes out of the camp.</i>

180
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:53,933
I wonder what Doc Maxine did this time.

181
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,902
Colonel Garcia is always so pissed at her.

182
00:13:56,969 --> 00:13:58,070
That's good, too.

183
00:13:58,137 --> 00:13:59,939
So she won't get in trouble
outside the camp.

184
00:14:00,706 --> 00:14:01,941
She's troublesome.

185
00:14:02,408 --> 00:14:04,577
The colonel probably got fed up with her.

186
00:14:05,544 --> 00:14:06,545
That's not it.

187
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:09,348
What?

188
00:14:09,415 --> 00:14:10,883
Why? What do you know?

189
00:14:11,951 --> 00:14:15,120
Me? Nothing, I don't know anything.

190
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:18,090
-He's asking you, what do you know?
-Your officer is asking you, Talledo.

191
00:14:18,157 --> 00:14:20,693
-What do you mean? I don't know anything.
-What is it?

192
00:14:20,759 --> 00:14:22,027
-Sir, it's nothing.
-Say it.

193
00:14:22,094 --> 00:14:24,029
-Nothing, sir.
-Say it.

194
00:14:24,096 --> 00:14:25,764
I heard earlier in the Medicube.

195
00:14:25,831 --> 00:14:26,832
What?

196
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,436
Bullet is Doc Maxine's brother.
That's what I heard.

197
00:14:32,638 --> 00:14:33,706
What?

198
00:14:34,807 --> 00:14:35,774
What?

199
00:14:35,841 --> 00:14:37,543
-This is dangerous.
-Are you sure?

200
00:14:38,477 --> 00:14:41,013
Big Boss might get into trouble again
because of her.

201
00:14:43,415 --> 00:14:44,416
Are you sure?

202
00:14:59,865 --> 00:15:01,533
<i>Your brother is alive!</i>

203
00:15:03,102 --> 00:15:04,970
Mom, even I was shocked.

204
00:15:06,305 --> 00:15:09,909
I told you not to lose hope.

205
00:15:10,776 --> 00:15:13,178
<i>But I lost hope.</i>

206
00:15:16,949 --> 00:15:19,618
<i>I'm his mother, but I gave up easily.</i>

207
00:15:21,854 --> 00:15:24,590
<i>I just accepted that your brother is dead.</i>

208
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:28,994
Mom, stop crying.

209
00:15:30,162 --> 00:15:32,698
It wasn't easy for you, too, right?

210
00:15:33,532 --> 00:15:36,035
You really had a hard time moving on.

211
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:38,203
<i>But you…</i>

212
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:41,640
<i>You didn't move on.</i>

213
00:15:44,343 --> 00:15:46,645
<i>You didn't give up on your brother.</i>

214
00:15:49,481 --> 00:15:53,819
<i>Maybe that's why
you're the one who found him.</i>

215
00:15:57,589 --> 00:15:58,857
<i>I will come home.</i>

216
00:16:00,259 --> 00:16:02,594
<i>I want to see your brother.</i>

217
00:16:05,331 --> 00:16:08,867
<i>I'll go to Urdan
so I can be with my children.</i>

218
00:16:09,868 --> 00:16:14,139
Mom, I'm sorry,
but the reunion you want will not happen.

219
00:16:20,946 --> 00:16:23,382
Mom, it's difficult to go to him.

220
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:25,884
He is at…

221
00:16:27,886 --> 00:16:29,588
at Mount Kalasangan.

222
00:16:30,889 --> 00:16:31,890
<i>In the mountains?</i>

223
00:16:32,858 --> 00:16:34,827
<i>There are rebels there, right?</i>

224
00:16:36,462 --> 00:16:38,464
It's a place here in Urdan…

225
00:16:40,766 --> 00:16:44,770
known as the terrorists'
center of gravity.

226
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:46,672
Mom…

227
00:16:48,741 --> 00:16:49,775
Rodel is…

228
00:16:52,945 --> 00:16:55,214
He is the leader of the PRG here in Urdan.

229
00:16:57,616 --> 00:16:59,251
<i>How did that happen?</i>

230
00:17:00,386 --> 00:17:03,789
<i>-Oh, my god, Maxine. Your brother.</i>
-Mom.

231
00:17:14,133 --> 00:17:17,369
You seem to be asking too much
from Doc Maxine, Dad.

232
00:17:18,904 --> 00:17:21,473
So you think she will not agree?

233
00:17:22,007 --> 00:17:23,275
She will not help us?

234
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,388
Well, as you know, Dad…

235
00:17:37,823 --> 00:17:40,025
It's hard to overpower feelings.

236
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,695
Especially when it comes to family.

237
00:17:44,763 --> 00:17:46,365
You and Diego are still not okay?

238
00:17:48,667 --> 00:17:52,104
We already talked
and he asked for my forgiveness.

239
00:17:53,372 --> 00:17:54,907
I know I've hurt you.

240
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:59,211
I punished you
for mistakes you didn't commit.

241
00:18:02,281 --> 00:18:03,449
Forgive me.

242
00:18:05,551 --> 00:18:08,887
I hope you can give me another chance
to show you…

243
00:18:10,656 --> 00:18:12,191
to prove to you…

244
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:16,595
how much I love you.

245
00:18:18,063 --> 00:18:19,331
But the thing is…

246
00:18:21,033 --> 00:18:24,269
I don't know if he can separate
his feelings for me

247
00:18:24,336 --> 00:18:26,138
from what happened
between the two of you, Dad.

248
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:29,508
I'm afraid that he can't.

249
00:18:32,678 --> 00:18:33,745
I'm sorry, Moira…

250
00:18:36,148 --> 00:18:39,651
if I am the reason you're unhappy now.

251
00:18:44,556 --> 00:18:48,127
<i>Doc Moira, it's time for your rounds
at the Medicube.</i>

252
00:18:56,335 --> 00:18:57,936
But don't worry about me.

253
00:19:00,439 --> 00:19:02,441
I'm strong like you.

254
00:19:48,253 --> 00:19:49,354
What's wrong?

255
00:19:54,826 --> 00:19:58,030
I spoke to my mom. I told her everything.

256
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:02,334
You mean everything?

257
00:20:04,503 --> 00:20:05,571
Everything.

258
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:26,525
This is all I can do for you right now.

259
00:20:29,661 --> 00:20:30,662
It's okay.

260
00:20:35,434 --> 00:20:36,501
That's okay.

261
00:20:37,035 --> 00:20:39,204
The important thing right now is…

262
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:45,077
I'm no longer hiding anything,
especially to you.

263
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:52,918
You probably know that Colonel Garcia
wants me to be an asset

264
00:20:52,985 --> 00:20:55,153
against the PRG and my brother, right?

265
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:01,760
They asked me to talk to you.

266
00:21:06,231 --> 00:21:08,033
They think I can convince you.

267
00:21:09,201 --> 00:21:10,369
Convince me?

268
00:21:11,403 --> 00:21:15,240
What do you mean,
they want me to betray my brother?

269
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:24,916
Will you really make me choose
who's more important to me?

270
00:21:35,927 --> 00:21:38,697
Lucas, I'm the one
who's caught in the middle here.

271
00:21:41,066 --> 00:21:44,403
No matter what I decide to do,
I will end up losing.

272
00:21:45,437 --> 00:21:49,274
Whatever choice I make,
I will hurt someone.

273
00:21:52,177 --> 00:21:53,211
How about you?

274
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:59,418
Won't you get hurt if I don't choose you?

275
00:22:04,022 --> 00:22:05,357
Have you decided already?

276
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:13,465
But I'm sure you will get hurt.

277
00:22:18,136 --> 00:22:22,341
Now, I'm sure that you'll resent me
if I don't help you.

278
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:27,646
But if I help you…

279
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:34,086
my brother will never forgive me.

280
00:22:47,432 --> 00:22:50,635
I won't deny that I will be hurt if…

281
00:22:53,004 --> 00:22:54,339
if you don't choose me.

282
00:22:57,242 --> 00:22:58,977
But I will understand.

283
00:23:01,413 --> 00:23:04,583
I know how hard it is for you
to make this choice.

284
00:23:07,953 --> 00:23:09,588
I will respect that.

285
00:23:20,499 --> 00:23:22,000
If I help you,

286
00:23:23,034 --> 00:23:26,638
can I get the assurance
that no one will get hurt,

287
00:23:26,705 --> 00:23:28,206
especially my brother?

288
00:23:28,273 --> 00:23:30,642
Lucas, a lot of people there are sick.

289
00:23:30,709 --> 00:23:33,412
Many are wounded.
I don't want them to get involved.

290
00:23:37,682 --> 00:23:40,452
Lucas, tell me the truth, please.

291
00:23:51,329 --> 00:23:52,864
I can't promise that.

292
00:23:58,437 --> 00:23:59,738
Especially if…

293
00:24:01,606 --> 00:24:03,108
if your brother fights back.

294
00:24:05,377 --> 00:24:08,647
Maxine, you have been here
in the camp long enough.

295
00:24:14,886 --> 00:24:17,389
There's no certainty in things like this.

296
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:17,582
I'm thinking of asking for a reassignment…

297
00:25:17,649 --> 00:25:20,151
so I would not be involved
in the operations here in Urdan.

298
00:25:20,218 --> 00:25:22,220
You are the Big Boss of the Alpha Team.

299
00:25:22,287 --> 00:25:25,857
We were all sent here
with a mission to defeat the rebels,

300
00:25:25,924 --> 00:25:27,125
and now you are leaving?

301
00:25:27,759 --> 00:25:29,227
It's a conflict of interest.

302
00:25:29,294 --> 00:25:31,897
So your relationship with Maxine
is more important.

303
00:25:31,963 --> 00:25:34,766
I'm the only one
who's making your situation difficult.

304
00:25:34,833 --> 00:25:39,170
And if I leave Urdan,
you have more chances to be happy.

305
00:25:39,237 --> 00:25:40,438
I love you so much, my child.

306
00:25:42,974 --> 00:25:45,877
<i>Even if that means
I will have to leave you here.</i>

307
00:25:45,944 --> 00:25:49,281
I don't want us to get to a point
where we can't stand each other.

308
00:25:49,347 --> 00:25:51,750
And you and my brother
are at war with each other.

309
00:25:51,816 --> 00:25:55,053
<i>I still want to remember
all the good memories that we've shared.</i>

310
00:25:55,787 --> 00:25:57,722
<i>So while it's still not too late…</i>

311
00:25:58,523 --> 00:26:00,225
<i>let's end this.</i>
