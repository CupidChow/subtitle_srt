00:00:44,677 --> 00:00:46,813
<i>At 08</i>:<i>00 hours today,</i>

2
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:52,085
<i>Philippine Revolutionary Group kidnapped</i>
<i>seven expat engineers of a theme park</i>

3
00:00:52,152 --> 00:00:54,287
<i>that's planned to be put up in Busuanga.</i>

4
00:00:54,354 --> 00:00:57,057
<i>Eight strikers from</i>
<i>the Third Scout Ranger Battalion</i>

5
00:00:57,123 --> 00:00:59,793
<i>who were deployed in the area</i>
<i>were kidnapped by the enemies</i>

6
00:01:00,493 --> 00:01:02,529
<i>while carrying out an ambush</i>

7
00:01:02,595 --> 00:01:05,532
<i>including their commanding officer,</i>

8
00:01:05,598 --> 00:01:08,701
<i>my father, Lieutenant General</i>
<i>Abraham Manalo.</i>

9
00:02:44,397 --> 00:02:45,698
What do you want from me?

10
00:02:45,765 --> 00:02:48,401
If you fail to give
the one million dollars we are asking for

11
00:02:48,468 --> 00:02:50,003
within an hour…

12
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:53,873
we will kill all of you!

13
00:04:07,547 --> 00:04:09,616
Stay together!
Don't lose sight of the enemy!

14
00:04:11,718 --> 00:04:14,020
We have no time. I have to save my father.

15
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:17,190
Wolf, cover me.

16
00:04:18,157 --> 00:04:19,959
-Copy.
-Go!

17
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:28,101
Get them out of here.

18
00:04:35,842 --> 00:04:36,809
I'll handle him.

19
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:45,785
You're already useless.

20
00:07:12,198 --> 00:07:13,299
Son.

21
00:07:13,366 --> 00:07:17,203
Son, get out of here.
Go on and save yourself.

22
00:07:19,138 --> 00:07:22,175
Dad, I will never leave you. Just hold on.

23
00:09:02,808 --> 00:09:03,809
Leave me here.

24
00:09:06,145 --> 00:09:07,480
Save yourself.

25
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:12,585
Dad!

26
00:09:16,455 --> 00:09:17,623
Don't worry. We're soldiers.

27
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:29,569
This isn't over.

28
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:21,847
Love…

29
00:11:23,983 --> 00:11:27,486
it has been a year since I got crippled.

30
00:11:27,553 --> 00:11:33,159
But up to now,
Lucas hasn't caught the enemies.

31
00:11:36,629 --> 00:11:37,797
Dad…

32
00:11:39,265 --> 00:11:42,034
we haven't stopped searching for them.

33
00:11:45,504 --> 00:11:47,373
I promise you and mother...

34
00:11:48,941 --> 00:11:50,609
I will personally catch them.

35
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:55,815
They will pay for what they did to you.

36
00:12:11,797 --> 00:12:13,165
Father…

37
00:12:14,934 --> 00:12:16,068
I will release this.

38
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:18,504
Here.

39
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:29,515
Don't worry too much about me.
I can take my medicine on my own.

40
00:12:31,484 --> 00:12:32,618
Dad!

41
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:37,957
That's nothing compared to all the things
you did for me and my brother.

42
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,995
I'm sorry, my children.

43
00:12:44,029 --> 00:12:45,564
I am a burden to you.

44
00:12:45,631 --> 00:12:48,467
Dad, there you go again.

45
00:12:48,534 --> 00:12:52,138
Don't say that.
We like taking care of you.

46
00:12:52,204 --> 00:12:53,973
We love you so much.

47
00:12:54,039 --> 00:12:57,143
So don't ever say that again, okay?

48
00:12:57,209 --> 00:13:01,547
Just like I said,
you don't have to take care of me.

49
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:07,219
What you should focus on, Lucas,
is destroying the PRG.

50
00:13:10,756 --> 00:13:16,195
Dad, shouldn't Lucas focus
on giving you a grandchild?

51
00:13:18,764 --> 00:13:21,367
So you're picking on me now, Judith?

52
00:13:21,433 --> 00:13:24,236
I don't have anybody in my life.
What can I do?

53
00:13:25,337 --> 00:13:28,507
But a lot of women like you.
You're just picky.

54
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:31,777
Your brother will not get married…

55
00:13:32,978 --> 00:13:35,815
until he exacts revenge
on the rebel who did this to me.

56
00:13:49,028 --> 00:13:50,696
Don't worry, Big Boss.

57
00:13:50,763 --> 00:13:52,865
The PRG will eventually fall
into our hands.

58
00:13:52,932 --> 00:13:54,867
Then, you can get married.

59
00:13:56,435 --> 00:13:59,238
That's not the reason
why I am pressuring you.

60
00:13:59,305 --> 00:14:03,175
Of course, I want to seek justice
for what happened to my father.

61
00:14:03,943 --> 00:14:05,845
We support you on that one, Big Boss.

62
00:14:06,745 --> 00:14:11,016
But by this time, you should also
be prepared to settle down.

63
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:11,951
-Right?
-Yes.

64
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:12,852
Yes.

65
00:14:14,186 --> 00:14:17,489
You know, Big Boss
is so dedicated to our missions

66
00:14:17,556 --> 00:14:19,959
that's why he does not have time for love.

67
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:21,260
Right.

68
00:14:21,327 --> 00:14:23,596
-I am dedicated too.
-Really? Love?

69
00:14:23,662 --> 00:14:27,032
Aside from not having the time,
women can be frustrating sometimes.

70
00:14:27,099 --> 00:14:32,638
They assume all soldiers
are womanizers, like this guy.

71
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:35,507
Or they'd end up as widows.

72
00:14:35,574 --> 00:14:36,475
That's the thing.

73
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:40,679
It's really a big
sacrifice to love a soldier.

74
00:14:40,746 --> 00:14:43,816
Don't worry, Big Boss.
You'll eventually find someone for you.

75
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:45,517
The question is…

76
00:14:45,584 --> 00:14:48,220
-What is it?
-Are you ready to raise a family?

77
00:14:48,287 --> 00:14:49,622
That's the question.

78
00:14:50,489 --> 00:14:51,824
That's a priority.

79
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:57,329
Well, because you said that,
I think it's time for romance.

80
00:14:57,396 --> 00:14:59,798
I'm game with that. I'm ready, anytime.

81
00:14:59,865 --> 00:15:01,233
-Me too.
-Really?

82
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:05,070
And once you find her, Big Boss,
tie her down, don't let her go.

83
00:15:05,137 --> 00:15:06,538
-Right.
-Tie her down, huh?

84
00:15:06,605 --> 00:15:09,575
-Yes.
-Really, tie her down like a chicken?

85
00:15:23,656 --> 00:15:25,691
-Lucas?
-Yes?

86
00:15:27,226 --> 00:15:28,694
Where are you going?

87
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:35,634
I'm just going to buy ingredients
for Father's chicken soup.

88
00:15:35,701 --> 00:15:37,336
Really, Lucas?

89
00:15:37,403 --> 00:15:40,773
Are you going to the supermarket
or to an eyeball?

90
00:15:41,407 --> 00:15:42,875
Eyeball?

91
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:45,144
The scent of your cologne can reach EDSA.

92
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:46,845
An eyeball, huh?

93
00:15:46,912 --> 00:15:50,115
I am just trying to look my best.

94
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:52,618
Admit it, Lucas.

95
00:15:52,685 --> 00:15:55,120
You're pressured
to give Father a grandchild.

96
00:15:56,555 --> 00:15:57,523
Right?

97
00:15:59,191 --> 00:16:00,326
That's easy.

98
00:16:00,392 --> 00:16:02,261
You know what's difficult?

99
00:16:02,328 --> 00:16:03,729
To find a woman

100
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:07,132
who can accept all the challenges
of being with a soldier.

101
00:16:09,835 --> 00:16:11,603
What's your ideal girl?

102
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:12,938
Ideal girl?

103
00:16:15,007 --> 00:16:16,342
Well…

104
00:16:17,843 --> 00:16:22,614
Well, she has to be a fighter
just like me.

105
00:16:22,681 --> 00:16:28,654
Because, you know,
relationships don't last forever.

106
00:16:28,721 --> 00:16:30,089
They all have an ending.

107
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:32,791
It only lasts forever

108
00:16:32,858 --> 00:16:35,828
if both parties are willing
to fight for it.

109
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:37,229
-Words.
-That's deep.

110
00:16:37,296 --> 00:16:39,431
I hope you find her soon, Lucas.

111
00:17:56,942 --> 00:17:58,544
Sorry, just need it for an emergency.

112
00:18:40,886 --> 00:18:43,255
-Excuse me!
-Get out of the way.

113
00:18:46,024 --> 00:18:47,826
Hand me the alcohol, please.

114
00:19:02,074 --> 00:19:03,842
A knife! I need a knife, please.

115
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:05,844
Knife.

116
00:19:09,214 --> 00:19:11,083
I hope he survives. I pity him.

117
00:19:12,084 --> 00:19:13,352
I pity him.

118
00:19:14,419 --> 00:19:15,420
What's going on?

119
00:19:17,055 --> 00:19:18,624
He choked.

120
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:20,459
The Heimlich maneuver didn't work,

121
00:19:20,526 --> 00:19:24,029
so a tracheotomy
is the last option to save him.

122
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:54,493
Ma'am, your husband is already
breathing. He is safe.

123
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:55,460
Thank you very much.

124
00:20:05,504 --> 00:20:07,773
Give way, please. Coming through.

125
00:20:09,174 --> 00:20:11,610
Please secure the air access.

126
00:20:11,677 --> 00:20:13,278
Okay, ma'am. We will take it from here.

127
00:20:13,345 --> 00:20:15,147
-All right. Please look after him.
-Yes, ma'am.

128
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:16,515
Thank you.

129
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:19,851
She's amazing.

130
00:20:22,621 --> 00:20:24,156
Thank you for this.

131
00:20:29,094 --> 00:20:30,395
I'll go ahead.

132
00:20:32,998 --> 00:20:34,233
Miss.

133
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:37,769
Miss, wait!

134
00:20:40,806 --> 00:20:41,740
Miss.

135
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:16,875
-Sorry.
-You're a pervert!

136
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:18,944
-I'm sorry.
-Pervert!

137
00:21:19,011 --> 00:21:20,646
-Pervert!
-I'm sorry.

138
00:21:20,712 --> 00:21:23,482
Miss, I didn't mean to do that. I'm sorry.

139
00:21:24,549 --> 00:21:27,019
I've heard that before.
You want me to break your…

140
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:29,621
That's destruction of private property.

141
00:21:29,688 --> 00:21:31,556
I really didn't mean to do that,
I'm sorry.

142
00:21:31,623 --> 00:21:34,593
You know what, you men are all the same!

143
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:38,930
Cheaters and perverts
who are only after sex!

144
00:21:38,997 --> 00:21:40,232
Sex?

145
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:43,835
-Really? You're unbelievable.
-That's right!

146
00:21:43,902 --> 00:21:45,237
Don't be too quick to-- No!

147
00:21:49,474 --> 00:21:51,643
Don't you dare follow me!

148
00:21:52,844 --> 00:21:54,413
What's that?

149
00:21:56,381 --> 00:21:58,517
I just lost my chance at "forever."

150
00:22:00,419 --> 00:22:02,154
Unbelievable.

151
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,703
-You have to be there, buddy.
-Of course.

152
00:22:18,503 --> 00:22:21,773
Sir Lucas, Sir Diego,
Don't forget about the feast next week.

153
00:22:22,507 --> 00:22:24,743
-There will be lechon.
-Lechon!

154
00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:26,078
We'll be there.

155
00:22:26,144 --> 00:22:28,980
-Great!
-That's good.

156
00:22:29,648 --> 00:22:33,151
-You shouldn't miss it.
-We'll all be there.

157
00:22:33,218 --> 00:22:34,386
Don't forget.

158
00:22:39,257 --> 00:22:40,425
What are you watching?

159
00:22:42,127 --> 00:22:44,830
It's not "what." It's "who."

160
00:22:45,664 --> 00:22:47,532
Who are you watching?

161
00:22:47,599 --> 00:22:50,936
That's the thing. I didn't get her name.

162
00:22:52,104 --> 00:22:55,173
She's one amazing woman.

163
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:59,978
I think I'm lovestruck. Big time.

164
00:23:00,045 --> 00:23:01,847
Did you forget how to speak?

165
00:23:03,615 --> 00:23:04,583
Why do you say that?

166
00:23:04,649 --> 00:23:05,784
Because you don't make sense.

167
00:23:08,019 --> 00:23:11,156
You're just envious.

168
00:23:44,356 --> 00:23:47,426
Sergeant Eugenio's town surely
knows how to celebrate a feast.

169
00:23:48,193 --> 00:23:51,696
I am missing my shots
because of all the lechon I ate.

170
00:23:51,763 --> 00:23:52,898
Me too.

171
00:23:56,201 --> 00:23:57,235
Wait.

172
00:23:58,203 --> 00:24:00,639
-What is it?
-It looks like…

173
00:24:00,705 --> 00:24:01,873
The trigger is broken.

174
00:24:03,175 --> 00:24:04,376
Mine too.

175
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:06,311
-The trigger is not working.
-Same here.

176
00:24:07,245 --> 00:24:09,080
-Is it jammed?
-Nothing.

177
00:24:09,147 --> 00:24:11,516
Hey! Are you still going to play?

178
00:24:11,583 --> 00:24:14,019
Sir, I think the trigger is broken.

179
00:24:14,085 --> 00:24:15,854
This one too. It's stuck.

180
00:24:15,921 --> 00:24:17,456
What's the problem?

181
00:24:21,059 --> 00:24:22,227
It's working.

182
00:24:22,861 --> 00:24:24,596
Only real soldiers can fire these.

183
00:24:27,699 --> 00:24:29,067
Thief!

184
00:24:29,134 --> 00:24:32,304
You animal! Give me back my motorcycle!
A thief! Help me!

185
00:24:32,370 --> 00:24:34,172
A thief! Come here!

186
00:24:34,239 --> 00:24:36,374
-A thief! Come here!
-Get out of the way!

187
00:24:36,441 --> 00:24:38,176
Stop him! The one on the motorcycle!

188
00:24:38,243 --> 00:24:40,245
-Stop him!
-What's going on?

189
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:42,814
A thief at such a young age!
Call the police!

190
00:24:42,881 --> 00:24:44,683
Thief!

191
00:24:45,317 --> 00:24:47,052
The thief is coming this way.

192
00:24:52,624 --> 00:24:54,860
-Let me borrow this.
-Hey!

193
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:57,696
Hey! We're on vacation.

194
00:24:59,397 --> 00:25:00,499
Sir!

195
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,201
Hey! My motorcycle!

196
00:25:04,069 --> 00:25:05,770
Hey! Come back here!

197
00:25:06,972 --> 00:25:08,039
Get out of the way!

198
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:14,045
We're using a toy gun.
Range is limited to five meters.

199
00:25:18,783 --> 00:25:19,918
Ten meters.

200
00:26:27,852 --> 00:26:29,721
Good thing my motorcycle is still working.

201
00:26:29,788 --> 00:26:31,623
-Did you call the police already?
-No need.

202
00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:33,458
His cohorts might get back at me.

203
00:26:33,525 --> 00:26:35,827
It's up to you
if you want to have him jailed.

204
00:26:46,538 --> 00:26:48,039
We need an ambulance here.

205
00:26:54,579 --> 00:26:56,314
I said I'm okay.

206
00:26:56,381 --> 00:26:57,449
Just lie down.

207
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:06,658
Don't be stubborn.

208
00:27:06,725 --> 00:27:09,694
Stop moving
or your spinal cord will be injured.

209
00:27:10,862 --> 00:27:12,263
Lie down.

210
00:27:16,668 --> 00:27:18,370
Wait, what are you going to do to me?

211
00:27:19,671 --> 00:27:21,840
First aid. Don't be too paranoid.

212
00:27:26,144 --> 00:27:27,712
Just my luck!

213
00:27:31,683 --> 00:27:33,752
Boss, how much for those two?

214
00:27:33,818 --> 00:27:34,853
You again?

215
00:27:36,287 --> 00:27:38,957
-Two thousand pesos.
-Two thousand pesos?

216
00:27:40,125 --> 00:27:41,559
What a rip off.

217
00:27:41,626 --> 00:27:42,727
All right.

218
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:44,329
Five hundred pesos.

219
00:27:45,063 --> 00:27:46,197
Five hundred?

220
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:48,700
Give me a break.

221
00:27:56,708 --> 00:27:58,710
-Three hundred.
-You got me there, boss.

222
00:28:00,812 --> 00:28:03,181
Good deal. You can't take it back.

223
00:28:03,882 --> 00:28:06,384
If you take it back,
I'll play and I'll get everything.

224
00:28:06,451 --> 00:28:07,819
You're good at this.

225
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:15,226
Hey. Wait. Do you also have a marker?

226
00:28:16,795 --> 00:28:19,297
-They are so handsome.
-Right?

227
00:28:28,707 --> 00:28:30,075
Your date is cuter.

228
00:28:32,177 --> 00:28:33,011
This?

229
00:28:34,045 --> 00:28:35,613
I'm lucky I met her.

230
00:28:38,316 --> 00:28:39,417
Your girlfriend's cute too.

231
00:28:40,251 --> 00:28:41,786
You look good together.

232
00:28:41,853 --> 00:28:42,754
This?

233
00:28:43,688 --> 00:28:45,256
We're just friends.

234
00:28:45,323 --> 00:28:46,624
Friends my ass.

235
00:28:46,691 --> 00:28:49,894
Wait. Why did you get these?

236
00:28:49,961 --> 00:28:51,596
What do you want me to do?

237
00:28:51,663 --> 00:28:55,700
The shooting gallery attendant
gave me these, so we won't go back.

238
00:28:55,767 --> 00:28:57,435
And it's your fault

239
00:28:57,502 --> 00:29:01,139
because you threatened to play
and win all of the prizes.

240
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:03,341
There you go again.

241
00:29:04,242 --> 00:29:07,212
Bro, you're one hell of a soldier.

242
00:29:07,278 --> 00:29:09,447
But you have a soft heart.

243
00:29:09,514 --> 00:29:11,416
What if we are in a battle?

244
00:29:11,483 --> 00:29:15,320
I'm a different man at work.
You know that.

245
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:16,988
You're right.

246
00:29:17,756 --> 00:29:21,259
That's why a lot of people
adore you, especially…

247
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:23,261
Captain Moira.

248
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:27,398
Why bring her into the conversation?

249
00:29:28,266 --> 00:29:31,035
You miss her, don't you?

250
00:29:34,339 --> 00:29:35,673
You're affected.

251
00:30:47,445 --> 00:30:49,247
<i>Bro, why did you two break up?</i>

252
00:30:50,014 --> 00:30:51,216
Stop asking.

253
00:30:51,282 --> 00:30:53,351
I'm happy with my life.
Besides, I already have her.

254
00:30:54,619 --> 00:30:59,724
We both know you could be happier.
She loves you so much.

255
00:30:59,791 --> 00:31:00,925
What's the story?

256
00:31:00,992 --> 00:31:02,393
Why are you suddenly so nosy?

257
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:05,029
-I just want to know.
-It's private.

258
00:31:05,630 --> 00:31:06,698
Suit yourself.

259
00:31:07,732 --> 00:31:12,871
I wonder what happened
to that young thief from earlier.

260
00:31:12,937 --> 00:31:13,771
That boy?

261
00:31:14,305 --> 00:31:17,542
I'm sure he's fine.
It's just a harmless injury.

262
00:31:19,577 --> 00:31:21,045
Why are you worried about him?

263
00:31:21,112 --> 00:31:23,414
He just reminds me of my younger self.

264
00:31:24,349 --> 00:31:28,219
That's also the kind of life I had
before I entered Boystown.

265
00:31:28,286 --> 00:31:29,220
I was astray.

266
00:31:34,592 --> 00:31:35,894
Is that the Chief?

267
00:31:48,806 --> 00:31:50,842
-Yes.
-Okay.

268
00:31:51,676 --> 00:31:52,777
Your Chief.

269
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:56,948
Don't answer that.

270
00:31:57,015 --> 00:31:58,349
I'll answer and I'd tell her,

271
00:31:58,416 --> 00:32:01,519
"Captain, you should come here,
right now because Diego is very lonely.

272
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:02,687
He needs you so badly."

273
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:05,123
-You will not answer that.
-Should I answer it?

274
00:32:05,189 --> 00:32:06,824
-I'll treat you to dinner. Steak.
-Steak?

275
00:32:06,891 --> 00:32:08,126
Yes, dinner.

276
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:10,361
I don't like steak. I'll just answer this.

277
00:32:10,428 --> 00:32:12,196
How about some whiskey?
Seventeen-year-old.

278
00:32:12,263 --> 00:32:13,564
Brandy, gold reserve.

279
00:32:13,631 --> 00:32:16,234
Blind date with my cousin
who's a flight attendant.

280
00:32:16,301 --> 00:32:17,335
Is she from the air force?

281
00:32:17,402 --> 00:32:19,971
Just a flight attendant.
I'll just show you her profile.

282
00:32:20,038 --> 00:32:23,007
I knew it. Are you really my best friend?

283
00:32:23,074 --> 00:32:25,376
You have a cousin like that?
Let me see her picture.

284
00:32:25,443 --> 00:32:26,811
-Hurry.
-Then don't answer that.

285
00:32:26,878 --> 00:32:28,479
I won't if you show me her picture.

286
00:32:39,724 --> 00:32:42,160
Why are they not answering my calls?

287
00:32:42,927 --> 00:32:43,761
Hurry.

288
00:32:48,032 --> 00:32:50,201
Wait. I think my phone is missing.

289
00:33:03,247 --> 00:33:05,249
Excuse me, sir. Is he the patient?

290
00:33:05,316 --> 00:33:08,486
Yes. We already did first aid.

291
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:10,822
A kid stole your phone?

292
00:33:13,157 --> 00:33:14,559
I will teach him a lesson.

293
00:33:14,625 --> 00:33:18,129
Why are you pissed?
I thought you pitied him.

294
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:20,565
Which hospital was he taken to?

295
00:33:38,449 --> 00:33:40,451
Can you please hurry up?

296
00:33:40,518 --> 00:33:43,554
And get these stuffed toys off my head.
It's embarrassing.

297
00:33:43,621 --> 00:33:47,492
Miss, please remove them.
It's embarrassing.

298
00:33:47,558 --> 00:33:48,960
But it looks all right.

299
00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:50,828
What do you mean? I look like a fool.

300
00:33:50,895 --> 00:33:52,397
Stop moving.

301
00:33:52,463 --> 00:33:54,265
We'll bring him inside like that.

302
00:33:54,332 --> 00:33:56,100
You know, I am all right.

303
00:33:57,035 --> 00:34:00,138
I'm fine.
Let me go home. I am not hurt at all.

304
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:03,508
It looks like you are. It's very obvious.

305
00:34:06,177 --> 00:34:07,779
-Thank you.
-Thank you, ma'am.

306
00:34:09,881 --> 00:34:11,282
Nurse Via!

307
00:34:11,949 --> 00:34:13,651
I think the patient dropped this.

308
00:34:15,353 --> 00:34:17,422
-Thank you.
-Okay.

309
00:34:24,195 --> 00:34:25,396
Who are you?

310
00:34:25,863 --> 00:34:29,634
I'm a nurse here
at the Metro General Hospital.

311
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:31,202
Why are you answering the phone?

312
00:34:31,269 --> 00:34:33,137
<i>The owner dropped it.</i>

313
00:34:33,204 --> 00:34:36,841
He was rushed here
because he had an accident.

314
00:34:37,408 --> 00:34:38,242
What?

315
00:34:59,897 --> 00:35:01,399
What happened here?

316
00:35:01,466 --> 00:35:03,101
A motorcycle accident, Doctor.

317
00:35:04,102 --> 00:35:04,936
Again?

318
00:35:05,570 --> 00:35:06,571
Are you intoxicated?

319
00:35:07,038 --> 00:35:07,872
No.

320
00:35:10,741 --> 00:35:13,344
Somebody wrote some notes on you.

321
00:35:14,479 --> 00:35:15,379
Who did this?

322
00:35:15,446 --> 00:35:16,881
That ruthless handsome guy.

323
00:35:16,948 --> 00:35:18,116
Who?

324
00:35:19,517 --> 00:35:20,585
I don't know him.

325
00:35:20,651 --> 00:35:22,787
Doctor, can you please
remove these things from my head?

326
00:35:22,854 --> 00:35:24,589
-I've been begging since I got here.
-Wait.

327
00:35:24,655 --> 00:35:26,757
Just relax and stop moving!

328
00:35:26,824 --> 00:35:28,726
Don't move. Scissors, please.

329
00:35:30,761 --> 00:35:32,363
Emma, the neck brace as well.

330
00:35:33,631 --> 00:35:36,300
Whoever did this, did a good job.

331
00:35:36,367 --> 00:35:39,604
It's so cute. You look good
with the stuffed toys.

332
00:35:41,038 --> 00:35:43,374
Look, it's so cute.

333
00:35:49,914 --> 00:35:51,315
It's not cute.

334
00:35:53,618 --> 00:35:54,685
Okay.

335
00:36:02,293 --> 00:36:05,129
-Let me check his chart again.
-Don't move.

336
00:36:06,197 --> 00:36:09,367
Your charts say that you have…

337
00:36:10,001 --> 00:36:12,470
You have a rib fracture.

338
00:36:13,070 --> 00:36:15,273
-Sprained ankle.
-It hurts.

339
00:36:17,775 --> 00:36:18,876
You're a thief?

340
00:36:18,943 --> 00:36:19,977
What?

341
00:36:20,044 --> 00:36:21,846
It says here, on your arm.

342
00:36:21,913 --> 00:36:26,317
"A thief. Make him suffer."

343
00:36:27,785 --> 00:36:29,787
Stay still. Come on.

344
00:36:31,455 --> 00:36:33,491
That's rubbish. Look, I had an accident.

345
00:36:34,025 --> 00:36:35,793
Okay. If you say so.

346
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:37,762
You're covered
by your medical insurance, right?

347
00:36:37,828 --> 00:36:41,599
You have to stay for a lab test and X-ray.

348
00:36:42,266 --> 00:36:45,002
Doc Maxine, Dr. Chavez wants to see you.

349
00:36:46,938 --> 00:36:49,173
I'll leave him to you.
Please make sure he gets an X-ray.

350
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:51,275
Here and here.

351
00:36:54,712 --> 00:36:58,316
You dropped your cellphone earlier.
Your guardian was calling.

352
00:36:59,917 --> 00:37:03,254
We'll schedule you
for an X-ray so just wait here, okay?

353
00:37:10,494 --> 00:37:12,063
The gang will kill me.

354
00:37:34,885 --> 00:37:36,520
It hurts.

355
00:37:44,962 --> 00:37:46,897
Wow, really?

356
00:37:46,964 --> 00:37:50,268
Yes, you should prepare
for the final interview and do your best.

357
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:09,487
Where are you going?

358
00:38:09,553 --> 00:38:11,322
Calm down, okay?

359
00:38:11,389 --> 00:38:14,125
I'm just going to the restroom.
I won't go anywhere.

360
00:38:14,191 --> 00:38:17,895
I'll leave this with you
so you will believe that I'll be back.

361
00:38:18,829 --> 00:38:19,864
Fine.

362
00:38:21,232 --> 00:38:23,501
Wait, where are you going?

363
00:38:23,567 --> 00:38:25,169
The restroom is that way.

364
00:38:30,141 --> 00:38:31,509
Just let me leave.

365
00:38:31,575 --> 00:38:34,612
You can't. You need to rest and recover.

366
00:38:34,679 --> 00:38:36,580
I am fine. There's nothing wrong with me.

367
00:38:37,815 --> 00:38:41,352
If my boss catches me,
I'll end up in the morgue.

368
00:38:43,421 --> 00:38:44,755
Are you a member of a syndicate?

369
00:38:44,822 --> 00:38:47,091
If I say yes, will you let me go?

370
00:38:47,158 --> 00:38:51,595
No. If your boss comes and beats you up,
I'll call security right away.

371
00:38:51,662 --> 00:38:52,663
So?

372
00:38:54,298 --> 00:38:57,568
Whatever.
I'll just go to the restroom for real.

373
00:38:57,635 --> 00:38:59,370
What a stubborn kid.

374
00:39:11,749 --> 00:39:15,886
These syndicates have the nerve
to exploit young people.

375
00:39:15,953 --> 00:39:17,955
They should work decent jobs
like the rest of us.

376
00:39:18,823 --> 00:39:20,624
Shameless!

377
00:39:36,173 --> 00:39:37,908
Nothing. It just keeps on ringing.

378
00:39:38,743 --> 00:39:40,911
-You can't come in.
-We just need to check on someone.

379
00:39:40,978 --> 00:39:42,680
-I'm sorry, but you can't.
-We'll be quick.

380
00:39:42,747 --> 00:39:45,116
-I'm sorry but you can't come in.
-We won't take long.

381
00:39:45,182 --> 00:39:48,386
We just need to check on someone.
You can escort us if you want.

382
00:39:48,452 --> 00:39:49,453
I said you can't!

383
00:39:50,454 --> 00:39:51,622
You're so stubborn.

384
00:39:53,524 --> 00:39:56,460
What now, boss? They won't let us in.

385
00:39:56,527 --> 00:39:58,429
They won't let handsome men inside.

386
00:39:58,929 --> 00:40:01,499
Don't worry. Marty called earlier.

387
00:40:01,565 --> 00:40:05,669
He said he'll try to escape
so he can find money.

388
00:40:05,736 --> 00:40:08,139
Let's go.
Let's wait for him around the block.

389
00:40:12,376 --> 00:40:14,044
Let's look for him inside.

390
00:40:41,238 --> 00:40:43,374
-Excuse us.
-Excuse me.

391
00:40:46,844 --> 00:40:52,750
Later, after around 30 minutes.
We need to check and give this,

392
00:40:53,317 --> 00:40:55,386
-And this.
-It's a physical therapy…

393
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:57,087
-Doctor?
-Sorry.

394
00:41:00,524 --> 00:41:01,992
Let's go see them.

395
00:41:20,711 --> 00:41:22,546
This will sting a bit.

396
00:41:24,048 --> 00:41:26,016
-Then, I will stitch you.
-It's ringing.

397
00:41:33,290 --> 00:41:34,625
Just a second.

398
00:42:26,610 --> 00:42:28,245
I can pay whatever he owes you.

399
00:42:28,312 --> 00:42:29,246
Here is my wallet.

400
00:42:29,313 --> 00:42:32,750
<i>Whoever can get this from me</i>
<i>can have all the money.</i>

401
00:42:35,319 --> 00:42:37,087
Captain Moira Defensor?

402
00:42:37,154 --> 00:42:38,756
Dr. Maxine Dela Cruz.

403
00:42:38,822 --> 00:42:42,393
Are you his attending physician?
Where is your patient?

404
00:42:42,459 --> 00:42:43,561
Let me check his charts.

405
00:42:43,627 --> 00:42:46,030
Wait, why would I give you
the chart of my patient?

406
00:42:46,096 --> 00:42:48,365
You're not in the camp,
don't make demands.

407
00:42:48,432 --> 00:42:49,633
Her boyfriend is a soldier.

408
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:52,536
That's impossible.
He did not have a military haircut.

409
00:42:52,603 --> 00:42:55,172
And he's a thief. Are you sure about that?

410
00:42:55,239 --> 00:42:56,674
Of course.

411
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:58,776
Their love story is famous in the army.

412
00:42:58,842 --> 00:43:01,078
Technical Sergeant Diego Ramos.

413
00:43:01,145 --> 00:43:03,981
Are you really leaving
without saluting me?

414
00:43:08,652 --> 00:43:11,355
-You have a wound?
-Yes.

415
00:43:11,422 --> 00:43:13,924
Where? Is it here? There?

416
00:43:13,991 --> 00:43:15,459
-Here, see.
-I'm sorry.

417
00:43:15,526 --> 00:43:18,362
It's done. You can already have the
stitches removed next week.

418
00:43:18,429 --> 00:43:22,366
Is there a hospital near your place?
Or somewhere near your workplace?

419
00:43:22,433 --> 00:43:24,068
Yes, there is, but I'll still come here.

420
00:43:24,134 --> 00:43:25,869
Isn't this far from you?

421
00:43:25,936 --> 00:43:28,872
It's okay. I don't mind
coming here every day.

422
00:43:28,939 --> 00:43:31,375
No, not every day.
Can you come three times a week?

423
00:43:31,442 --> 00:43:32,610
As long as you're my doctor.

424
00:43:32,676 --> 00:43:34,545
Is it important who your doctor is?

425
00:43:34,612 --> 00:43:36,981
Of course, especially
if she's as beautiful as you.

426
00:43:37,047 --> 00:43:41,018
<i>I'm just happy that</i>
<i>there's another life that's been saved.</i>

427
00:43:41,085 --> 00:43:44,488
Me, I'm happy because I am with you again.
