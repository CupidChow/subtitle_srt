1
00:00:12,245 --> 00:00:16,616
If you fail to give within an hour
the one million dollars we are asking for,

2
00:00:16,683 --> 00:00:18,251
we will kill all of you!

3
00:00:18,952 --> 00:00:19,986
<i>I'm going in.</i>

4
00:00:20,053 --> 00:00:22,022
Stay together!
Don't lose sight of the enemy!

5
00:00:22,522 --> 00:00:24,858
<i>We have no time. I have to save my father.</i>

6
00:00:39,973 --> 00:00:42,308
<i>We haven't stopped searching for them.</i>

7
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:46,346
<i>I promise you and mother,</i>
<i>I will personally catch them.</i>

8
00:00:58,258 --> 00:00:59,459
Sorry, it's an emergency.

9
00:01:07,834 --> 00:01:08,768
You're a pervert!

10
00:01:08,835 --> 00:01:12,605
You men are all the same!
Cheaters and perverts.

11
00:01:14,374 --> 00:01:16,009
Just lost my chance at "forever."

12
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:17,610
Thief!

13
00:01:17,677 --> 00:01:19,379
You animal! Give me back my motorcycle!

14
00:01:23,349 --> 00:01:24,751
<i>What happened here?</i>

15
00:01:24,818 --> 00:01:26,352
Motorcycle accident, Doctor.

16
00:01:26,419 --> 00:01:29,889
Somebody wrote some notes on you.
Who did this?

17
00:01:29,956 --> 00:01:31,391
That ruthless handsome guy.

18
00:01:31,891 --> 00:01:35,695
These syndicates have the nerve
to exploit young people.

19
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:37,363
<i>They should work decent jobs.</i>

20
00:01:39,866 --> 00:01:41,134
Hello?

21
00:01:45,672 --> 00:01:46,506
Hello.

22
00:02:02,689 --> 00:02:04,390
Look at that. Small world.

23
00:02:06,025 --> 00:02:08,394
You're a doctor here? No wonder.

24
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:11,064
No wonder you're cool.

25
00:02:12,298 --> 00:02:13,566
So…

26
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:16,169
You are Big Boss?

27
00:02:16,236 --> 00:02:17,470
Yes.

28
00:02:18,071 --> 00:02:20,006
Why do you have my friend's phone?

29
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:23,343
My patient asked me to hold on to it.

30
00:02:24,177 --> 00:02:25,245
Your patient?

31
00:02:25,311 --> 00:02:28,414
How are you related to him?
Are you a brother? His friend?

32
00:02:29,949 --> 00:02:31,451
-Boss?
-Boss?

33
00:02:32,285 --> 00:02:33,186
No.

34
00:02:33,253 --> 00:02:34,954
That phone belongs to my friend.

35
00:02:35,021 --> 00:02:38,124
We're looking for it
because that kid stole it.

36
00:02:38,191 --> 00:02:39,559
But why do you have that phone?

37
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:52,772
Nurse Via.

38
00:02:55,275 --> 00:02:57,544
Where is our patient?

39
00:02:58,645 --> 00:03:00,613
Oh, no. Where is he?

40
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,315
Maybe, he's having his X-ray, Doc.

41
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:06,986
What's your name again, Miss?

42
00:03:07,053 --> 00:03:07,921
Wait.

43
00:03:08,555 --> 00:03:15,295
You threatened that kid
that he'd end up in a morgue?

44
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:17,463
Morgue? He said that?

45
00:03:18,598 --> 00:03:21,734
Wow. Don't believe
what that kid is saying.

46
00:03:23,436 --> 00:03:24,270
Nurse Via?

47
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:25,705
Yes, Doc?

48
00:03:26,906 --> 00:03:28,608
Please tell this guy…

49
00:03:29,909 --> 00:03:31,010
to get out.

50
00:03:31,778 --> 00:03:34,180
Ask security to see them out.

51
00:03:34,247 --> 00:03:36,316
-Security?
-Okay, Doc.

52
00:03:36,382 --> 00:03:40,553
Sir, I'm sorry
but you're not allowed here.

53
00:03:41,254 --> 00:03:42,488
I'm sorry.

54
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:43,523
Okay.

55
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:26,132
I can see how you stare at the doctor.

56
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:27,834
I'm just saying.

57
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:33,106
She's the woman
who saved the man in the grocery.

58
00:04:33,172 --> 00:04:34,340
She's amazing, right?

59
00:04:36,843 --> 00:04:38,144
Amazing or...

60
00:04:39,145 --> 00:04:40,079
beautiful?

61
00:04:45,351 --> 00:04:46,452
Both.

62
00:04:47,654 --> 00:04:48,921
That's possible, right?

63
00:04:52,525 --> 00:04:55,862
Wait. If that doctor has my phone…

64
00:04:57,697 --> 00:04:59,999
it means the kid escaped?

65
00:05:00,066 --> 00:05:02,802
Yes, it looks like he escaped.

66
00:05:02,869 --> 00:05:05,838
He couldn't have gone far.
He's just somewhere around.

67
00:05:05,905 --> 00:05:07,740
That's right.
He's just around here somewhere.

68
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:12,178
You better go after him
before we lose him.

69
00:05:22,588 --> 00:05:23,990
Ouch! It hurts.

70
00:05:24,057 --> 00:05:26,092
My appendix.

71
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:28,795
Man, my appendix hurts. You go ahead.

72
00:05:29,562 --> 00:05:32,131
-Ouch.
-You're wrong.

73
00:05:32,198 --> 00:05:33,733
The appendix is on the left side.

74
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:38,938
Yes, it really hurts. Ouch.

75
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:43,142
Ouch! It really hurts.

76
00:05:43,209 --> 00:05:45,778
Kidding. Your appendix
is on the right side.

77
00:05:48,548 --> 00:05:51,217
Great. You're really good.
Come on, let's look for him.

78
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:57,357
Where are we going?

79
00:05:58,024 --> 00:06:02,261
The guys we saw earlier,
I think he's with them.

80
00:06:02,995 --> 00:06:04,564
They said they are waiting for someone.

81
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:06,399
Go ahead and hit him.

82
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:08,668
Beat him up.

83
00:06:08,735 --> 00:06:09,702
Good for you.

84
00:06:09,769 --> 00:06:10,970
Go ahead.

85
00:06:12,305 --> 00:06:13,339
Good for you!

86
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,309
That's what you get.

87
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:17,610
Go ahead.

88
00:06:18,311 --> 00:06:19,479
Come on, fight back.

89
00:06:20,813 --> 00:06:21,748
Where are you?

90
00:06:23,149 --> 00:06:25,785
Wait. Just a second.

91
00:06:26,586 --> 00:06:28,221
Do we really need to do that?

92
00:06:29,756 --> 00:06:31,491
We'll just get into a fight.

93
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:34,694
It's as if you're not used
to guerrilla warfare.

94
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:37,463
I just want to talk to that kid.

95
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:39,499
Wow. That's sweet.

96
00:06:39,565 --> 00:06:42,034
It's really like you have a connection.

97
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:44,370
Looks like you'd replace me with him?

98
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:47,173
Cut it out.

99
00:06:49,609 --> 00:06:50,610
Hey!

100
00:06:52,545 --> 00:06:55,581
Guys who lack in the looks department.

101
00:06:56,516 --> 00:06:57,583
Stop that.

102
00:07:12,064 --> 00:07:13,900
-What's happening here?
-Who are you?

103
00:07:13,966 --> 00:07:15,968
Don't meddle here.

104
00:07:16,035 --> 00:07:19,405
Get out of here if you don't want
to end up like these two.

105
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:22,074
I need something from this kid.

106
00:07:22,141 --> 00:07:24,210
Once we're done with him,
you can have them.

107
00:07:25,144 --> 00:07:27,046
Sir, please help me. I'm begging you.

108
00:07:28,414 --> 00:07:29,482
Hey, kid.

109
00:07:30,249 --> 00:07:31,217
You stole from them too?

110
00:07:34,253 --> 00:07:37,390
Why is your face all beaten up?
What did you do to them?

111
00:07:38,257 --> 00:07:43,029
The truth is he wants to leave the group,
but he owes them.

112
00:07:43,095 --> 00:07:45,498
He needs to pay them 25,000 pesos.

113
00:07:45,565 --> 00:07:47,233
Twenty-five thousand pesos?

114
00:07:51,904 --> 00:07:53,506
How much rice can you buy with that?

115
00:07:54,774 --> 00:07:56,909
I can pay whatever he owes you.

116
00:07:58,544 --> 00:07:59,445
Here's my wallet.

117
00:07:59,512 --> 00:08:03,182
Whoever can get this from me
can have the money.

118
00:08:04,217 --> 00:08:05,451
Really? Are you serious?

119
00:08:05,518 --> 00:08:06,652
You're not part of it.

120
00:08:09,755 --> 00:08:11,624
Why would you do that for him?

121
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:15,428
I'm his brother.

122
00:08:19,699 --> 00:08:20,666
What's your name again?

123
00:08:20,733 --> 00:08:23,302
Marty. Marty Talledo.

124
00:08:23,369 --> 00:08:24,737
Talledo.

125
00:08:25,438 --> 00:08:26,539
I'm Marty's elder brother.

126
00:08:26,606 --> 00:08:27,874
What?

127
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:30,042
Whoever gets this can have the money.

128
00:08:33,112 --> 00:08:35,815
You're dead
if there's nothing inside your wallet.

129
00:09:09,515 --> 00:09:10,616
Ouch.

130
00:09:19,525 --> 00:09:21,060
You even have pocket knives.

131
00:09:23,729 --> 00:09:25,131
Okay, here's the deal.

132
00:09:25,197 --> 00:09:27,033
Everyone with a knife goes to him.

133
00:09:28,334 --> 00:09:29,902
I'll take whoever has a gun.

134
00:09:37,043 --> 00:09:38,945
You talk too much.

135
00:09:39,011 --> 00:09:40,079
How would I know?

136
00:09:40,146 --> 00:09:42,248
Good thing they don't have a gun.

137
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:53,626
Yes, doctor?

138
00:09:53,693 --> 00:09:55,895
Doctor Maxine, look at this.

139
00:09:55,962 --> 00:09:57,897
There's something strange in the lungs.

140
00:10:00,466 --> 00:10:01,934
I'll show you something else.

141
00:10:09,208 --> 00:10:10,076
Doc?

142
00:10:10,142 --> 00:10:12,311
Our hunch is correct.

143
00:10:12,378 --> 00:10:15,147
The patient escaped,
but his guardian is here.

144
00:10:15,214 --> 00:10:16,415
She just arrived.

145
00:10:17,516 --> 00:10:18,651
Where is she?

146
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:48,814
Moira?

147
00:10:51,917 --> 00:10:53,953
Capt. Moira Defensor?

148
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:56,756
Doctor Maxine Dela Cruz.

149
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:00,159
Are you his attending physician?

150
00:11:00,226 --> 00:11:02,595
Where is the patient?
Let me see his charts.

151
00:11:03,429 --> 00:11:06,332
Wait, why would I give you
my patient's chart?

152
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:08,567
He's my patient, not yours.

153
00:11:08,634 --> 00:11:11,370
And besides, you're not in the camp,
so don't make demands.

154
00:11:11,437 --> 00:11:13,806
I didn't come here to fight.

155
00:11:13,873 --> 00:11:17,410
We may have unresolved issues,
but that's not the reason I'm here.

156
00:11:17,476 --> 00:11:19,278
I'm here for your patient.

157
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:21,647
That person is important to me.

158
00:11:21,714 --> 00:11:22,848
Important to you?

159
00:11:23,382 --> 00:11:25,951
Is he in a critical condition?
Where is he?

160
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:27,987
Why don't you know where he is?

161
00:11:28,654 --> 00:11:31,424
If I knew where he is,
I would've told you earlier

162
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:33,426
so we can end this conversation.

163
00:11:33,492 --> 00:11:36,462
Settle his bill
so you won't have problems with us.

164
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:39,298
Nurse Via?

165
00:11:40,232 --> 00:11:41,267
Yes, Doctor?

166
00:11:42,568 --> 00:11:45,805
Please tell security
to check all the men's restrooms.

167
00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:49,408
If he's not there,
she will pay the patient's bill.

168
00:11:49,475 --> 00:11:50,576
Copy, Doc.

169
00:11:51,811 --> 00:11:53,746
Wait, we're not done talking yet.

170
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:56,816
Nurse Via will talk to you.

171
00:11:57,450 --> 00:11:58,584
I'm busy.

172
00:12:02,321 --> 00:12:05,057
Miss, excuse me.
Where's the men's restroom?

173
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:07,093
It's over there.

174
00:12:08,327 --> 00:12:09,261
Thank you.

175
00:12:32,818 --> 00:12:36,021
Sandra! Moira is in the emergency room.

176
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:37,089
Moira?

177
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:39,825
Moira Defensor?

178
00:12:39,892 --> 00:12:42,728
The one who stole your guy
when we were still in med school?

179
00:12:42,795 --> 00:12:43,896
Exactly.

180
00:12:43,963 --> 00:12:48,000
And she's one of the reasons
I have trust issues with men.

181
00:12:48,067 --> 00:12:51,937
Which explains
why you're still a virgin up to now.

182
00:12:52,004 --> 00:12:54,807
Hey. Shut it. Someone might hear you.

183
00:12:54,874 --> 00:12:57,176
Wait, what's her business here?

184
00:12:57,910 --> 00:12:59,445
Did something happen to her?

185
00:13:00,246 --> 00:13:03,749
Nothing. She came for her boyfriend.

186
00:13:03,816 --> 00:13:05,985
-Boyfriend?
-Yes.

187
00:13:06,051 --> 00:13:08,988
But I think her boyfriend
is too young for her.

188
00:13:09,054 --> 00:13:11,524
What? Her boyfriend is a soldier.

189
00:13:12,091 --> 00:13:14,660
That's impossible.
He didn't have a military haircut.

190
00:13:14,727 --> 00:13:17,396
He's a thief! Are you sure about that?

191
00:13:17,897 --> 00:13:18,964
Of course.

192
00:13:19,498 --> 00:13:21,934
Their love story is famous in the army.

193
00:13:22,001 --> 00:13:24,570
Her boyfriend is a technical sergeant,

194
00:13:25,171 --> 00:13:28,874
but Moira's rank is higher
because she's an army surgeon.

195
00:13:30,075 --> 00:13:30,910
Okay.

196
00:13:32,011 --> 00:13:34,980
If her boyfriend is a soldier,

197
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:37,817
who is the patient who escaped earlier?

198
00:13:42,354 --> 00:13:43,756
What happened to him?

199
00:13:44,557 --> 00:13:46,659
Nurse Via, kindly call Doc Maxine.

200
00:13:46,725 --> 00:13:47,660
-Okay.
-Bring him here.

201
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:07,680
What happened?

202
00:14:07,746 --> 00:14:09,882
They said you had an accident.

203
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:14,587
Follow me.

204
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:35,608
He can handle that.

205
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:37,176
Sorry.

206
00:14:39,345 --> 00:14:41,380
What happened to my patient?

207
00:14:41,914 --> 00:14:47,519
He got into a fight in the parking lot
with a bunch of fools.

208
00:14:47,586 --> 00:14:49,221
But he can handle it, right?

209
00:14:49,288 --> 00:14:52,658
This isn't an accident.
This looks like an assault.

210
00:14:53,259 --> 00:14:54,927
Did you gang up on this kid
and beat him up?

211
00:14:54,994 --> 00:14:56,929
What? Of course not.

212
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:02,801
What happened to you?

213
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:06,038
Are you okay?

214
00:15:06,105 --> 00:15:08,107
Tell me, what happened to you?

215
00:15:08,173 --> 00:15:09,675
Did he do this to you?

216
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:13,279
No. You're wrong. He saved me.

217
00:15:13,946 --> 00:15:17,283
Just relax. Don't be scared of this guy.

218
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:19,485
I'll take care of you.

219
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:21,987
Just tell me,
we have security personnel here.

220
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:23,722
They will protect you.

221
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:25,257
Tell me the truth.

222
00:15:25,324 --> 00:15:27,793
Doc, he saved me.

223
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:49,048
Why won't you believe him?

224
00:15:52,885 --> 00:15:56,522
We'll give you medicine and later,
they'll get your x-ray.

225
00:15:56,588 --> 00:15:59,491
Nurse Emma, Nurse Hazel,
please take him for an x-ray after that.

226
00:15:59,558 --> 00:16:00,559
Copy, doctor.

227
00:16:02,061 --> 00:16:04,363
Nurse Via, call security.

228
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:09,068
Ask for a CCTV copy to see
what really happened earlier.

229
00:16:09,134 --> 00:16:10,803
The parking lot is near here.

230
00:16:10,869 --> 00:16:13,038
I just want to be sure he's protected.

231
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:15,607
I'll take care of the police.

232
00:16:15,674 --> 00:16:16,809
Copy, doctor.

233
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:19,445
Police? Doc, wait.

234
00:16:22,548 --> 00:16:24,450
I haven't heard from you in a long time.

235
00:16:25,117 --> 00:16:26,919
Yes, I know.

236
00:16:27,553 --> 00:16:29,955
Is it difficult for you to avoid me?

237
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:32,891
You look okay, though.

238
00:16:40,099 --> 00:16:40,933
Wait…

239
00:16:42,701 --> 00:16:44,603
you're really not going to talk to me?

240
00:16:46,205 --> 00:16:48,407
Are you just talking to me
because of my rank?

241
00:16:52,911 --> 00:16:54,146
You're right, ma'am.

242
00:16:54,213 --> 00:16:55,681
Are you trying to annoy me?

243
00:16:56,782 --> 00:16:58,250
How long will this go on?

244
00:16:59,818 --> 00:17:03,389
You're not answering my calls.
You don't tell me where you are.

245
00:17:03,989 --> 00:17:05,858
How long do you plan to avoid me?

246
00:17:05,924 --> 00:17:07,192
Answer me.

247
00:17:07,826 --> 00:17:09,094
Why are you doing this?

248
00:17:11,597 --> 00:17:13,098
Diego, I just want to see you.

249
00:17:13,165 --> 00:17:14,666
I know what you're thinking…

250
00:17:16,101 --> 00:17:17,236
and you're wrong.

251
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:20,406
I'm doing this not because of you.

252
00:17:20,472 --> 00:17:22,674
I just changed my mind.

253
00:17:23,175 --> 00:17:25,644
And I don't know
how I can explain it to you.

254
00:17:26,578 --> 00:17:27,679
That's all.

255
00:17:27,746 --> 00:17:28,981
That's not true.

256
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:30,349
Now, if we're done…

257
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:32,184
-Please.
-I'm going to leave.

258
00:17:32,251 --> 00:17:33,485
Diego, stay right here.

259
00:17:34,186 --> 00:17:35,587
Diego Ramos.

260
00:17:35,654 --> 00:17:37,689
Technical Sergeant Diego Ramos!

261
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:41,727
Are you really going to leave
without saluting me?

262
00:17:56,141 --> 00:17:57,109
Stay right there...

263
00:17:58,410 --> 00:17:59,244
the whole night.

264
00:18:01,713 --> 00:18:02,748
Until you die...

265
00:18:04,483 --> 00:18:06,452
I will never acknowledge your salute.

266
00:18:28,907 --> 00:18:33,345
If you are avoiding me
because of an order from my dad…

267
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:38,517
our commanding officer…

268
00:18:42,821 --> 00:18:44,656
if it's because you respect him…

269
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:49,294
because you owe your life to him.

270
00:18:53,198 --> 00:18:56,935
I hope you'd think about the day
you told me you love me.

271
00:19:00,038 --> 00:19:02,541
Because I will never forget that.

272
00:19:45,317 --> 00:19:47,553
Why don't you believe
what Marty is saying?

273
00:19:47,619 --> 00:19:48,654
Doc?

274
00:19:51,924 --> 00:19:54,560
So, what is it really?
How are you related to him?

275
00:19:54,626 --> 00:19:55,527
Is he your son?

276
00:19:55,594 --> 00:19:56,562
No.

277
00:19:57,396 --> 00:19:59,398
I don't know him, okay?

278
00:19:59,464 --> 00:20:02,968
We're here to get the cellphone
that he stole from my friend.

279
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:05,637
He got into trouble.
That's why we helped him.

280
00:20:06,471 --> 00:20:09,575
Wait, you helped the person
who stole from you?

281
00:20:09,641 --> 00:20:10,776
Yes.

282
00:20:10,842 --> 00:20:11,910
I don't believe you.

283
00:20:11,977 --> 00:20:14,179
It's more believable that you beat him up.

284
00:20:14,246 --> 00:20:15,647
We didn't.

285
00:20:16,648 --> 00:20:19,718
Why won't you believe me?
Why does it seem like you hate me?

286
00:20:21,253 --> 00:20:23,255
I hate bad people.

287
00:20:23,322 --> 00:20:27,626
Aside from the fact that I hate perverts,
I also hate abusive people.

288
00:20:27,693 --> 00:20:32,030
Those who use their power
to coerce and bring people down.

289
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:37,669
Whether it's a politician,
criminal, police or soldier.

290
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:40,138
You also hate soldiers?

291
00:20:40,205 --> 00:20:42,941
Not all of them.

292
00:20:44,309 --> 00:20:45,244
Why?

293
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:48,247
You know, I don't have
time to talk to you.

294
00:20:48,313 --> 00:20:51,516
Especially to the big boss of hoodlums
who hurt children.

295
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:54,987
You're mistaken.
I'm not that kind of person. Come on.

296
00:21:01,627 --> 00:21:03,161
I am calling to…

297
00:21:18,343 --> 00:21:19,711
Why did you do that?

298
00:21:20,212 --> 00:21:21,546
I'll be honest with you.

299
00:21:23,448 --> 00:21:26,118
Well, I'm an accountant.

300
00:21:26,852 --> 00:21:28,387
I can't have trouble with the police.

301
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:30,889
If that happens,
my job will be put on the line.

302
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:33,358
Come on, please cooperate.

303
00:21:33,425 --> 00:21:34,793
Why would I do that?

304
00:21:35,827 --> 00:21:37,329
I don't believe you.

305
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:38,997
Give me my phone.

306
00:21:39,998 --> 00:21:42,367
-You're unbelievable.
-Give it to me.

307
00:21:42,434 --> 00:21:44,536
-I'll be dead.
-No, give it to me.

308
00:21:45,637 --> 00:21:46,838
-Here
-Give it to me.

309
00:21:50,776 --> 00:21:51,810
Here it is.

310
00:21:55,013 --> 00:21:55,914
Here it is.

311
00:22:18,770 --> 00:22:20,072
Kelly.

312
00:24:07,879 --> 00:24:09,147
What are you doing here?

313
00:24:10,649 --> 00:24:11,850
I can't sleep.

314
00:24:12,417 --> 00:24:15,987
I'm not used to having someone mad at me.

315
00:24:20,759 --> 00:24:22,060
By the way, I'm Lucas.

316
00:24:22,694 --> 00:24:23,728
Lucas Manalo.

317
00:24:24,963 --> 00:24:27,199
You are Doc Maxine Dela Cruz, right?

318
00:24:27,732 --> 00:24:29,201
I already asked about you.

319
00:24:38,844 --> 00:24:40,846
You're so friendly.

320
00:24:43,081 --> 00:24:45,450
You still don't believe
that I'm not a bad person.

321
00:24:47,486 --> 00:24:50,255
I will only believe you

322
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:55,527
after I see the CCTV footage
of Marty's mauling.

323
00:24:57,863 --> 00:24:59,297
The footage will be out tomorrow.

324
00:24:59,364 --> 00:25:02,367
So you should find a good lawyer.

325
00:25:04,336 --> 00:25:05,670
No need for that.

326
00:25:05,737 --> 00:25:07,606
Wow. You're confident.

327
00:25:08,173 --> 00:25:10,842
If you want, I'll join you.
Let's watch it together.

328
00:25:11,877 --> 00:25:12,844
I don't want to.

329
00:25:13,545 --> 00:25:14,746
We're not even close.

330
00:25:46,711 --> 00:25:47,546
Bro.

331
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:50,615
For you.

332
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:53,351
-Donuts.
-Really?

333
00:25:53,952 --> 00:25:56,588
-Great.
-Is Doc Maxine inside?

334
00:25:56,655 --> 00:25:58,123
She just went inside.

335
00:25:58,189 --> 00:25:59,357
Good.

336
00:25:59,824 --> 00:26:00,692
Thank you.

337
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:02,694
Go ahead.

338
00:26:03,528 --> 00:26:04,529
What is this?

339
00:26:05,897 --> 00:26:08,567
Fight back!

340
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,535
Come on!

341
00:26:12,003 --> 00:26:13,538
There.

342
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:18,743
Punch him. Hit him hard. There you go.

343
00:26:19,744 --> 00:26:22,447
Kick him. Kick him some more!

344
00:26:22,514 --> 00:26:26,518
Harder, kick him some more. There you go.

345
00:26:38,997 --> 00:26:40,231
Good for you.

346
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:44,069
Go ahead. Slap him.

347
00:26:50,475 --> 00:26:51,676
He's good.

348
00:27:03,588 --> 00:27:05,090
-Was it good?
-How did you get in here?

349
00:27:09,794 --> 00:27:11,696
-For you.
-How long have you been here?

350
00:27:13,064 --> 00:27:13,898
Quite a while.

351
00:27:20,872 --> 00:27:22,173
Do I still need a lawyer?

352
00:27:27,779 --> 00:27:29,481
Your name is cleared.

353
00:27:30,882 --> 00:27:33,818
-I'm sorry I misjudged you.
-I told you.

354
00:27:34,552 --> 00:27:37,155
If you're really sorry,
you can be my doctor.

355
00:27:38,023 --> 00:27:39,824
-Why?
-So, you can treat my wound.

356
00:27:40,725 --> 00:27:43,194
-What? You have a wound?
-Yes.

357
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:49,067
There you go again.

358
00:27:49,734 --> 00:27:50,969
Do you really have a wound?

359
00:27:51,036 --> 00:27:52,570
Yes, I have. Here.

360
00:27:53,938 --> 00:27:56,441
Where is it? There?

361
00:27:56,508 --> 00:27:58,143
It hurts. Wait.

362
00:27:59,110 --> 00:28:00,311
Here it is.

363
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:04,783
-I'm sorry.
-I told you.

364
00:28:11,890 --> 00:28:12,757
Ouch!

365
00:28:20,398 --> 00:28:22,100
Your wound opened up. What happened?

366
00:28:22,801 --> 00:28:24,035
When did this happen?

367
00:28:24,102 --> 00:28:27,605
A few days ago.

368
00:28:28,973 --> 00:28:30,141
What happened?

369
00:28:30,208 --> 00:28:31,710
What happened?

370
00:28:32,811 --> 00:28:34,979
My boss got into a fight.

371
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:39,884
I had to help him. I defended him.

372
00:28:42,587 --> 00:28:44,055
Is that an accountant's job?

373
00:28:44,756 --> 00:28:45,790
No.

374
00:28:46,991 --> 00:28:49,461
But I'm his assistant, you know.

375
00:28:49,527 --> 00:28:54,766
I really owe him a lot.
And besides, I love my job.

376
00:28:56,801 --> 00:28:58,036
Well, aren't you loyal.

377
00:28:59,671 --> 00:29:01,039
Well, sort of.

378
00:29:03,842 --> 00:29:07,045
You should be careful.
Avoid getting into fights.

379
00:29:07,112 --> 00:29:09,247
Avoid trouble. Take care of this.

380
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:10,682
Yes, Doc.

381
00:29:11,182 --> 00:29:12,550
-It's done.
-It's done.

382
00:29:12,617 --> 00:29:13,952
-Okay.
-Okay.

383
00:29:14,018 --> 00:29:15,754
You can have the stitch removed next week.

384
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:18,323
And just keep it clean.

385
00:29:18,389 --> 00:29:22,127
Is there a hospital near your place
or where you're working?

386
00:29:22,193 --> 00:29:25,363
There is, but I will still go here.

387
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:26,397
Here?

388
00:29:27,999 --> 00:29:29,834
Isn't this far from you?

389
00:29:29,901 --> 00:29:33,638
It's okay. I don't mind
coming here every day.

390
00:29:33,705 --> 00:29:35,774
Not every day. Three times a week is fine.

391
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,308
-Three times?
-That will do.

392
00:29:37,375 --> 00:29:38,543
As long as you're my doctor.

393
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:41,412
-Is it important who your doctor is?
-Of course.

394
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:43,782
Especially if she's as beautiful as you.

395
00:29:46,084 --> 00:29:49,187
If we're talking about beauty,
then I am your best option.

396
00:29:49,254 --> 00:29:51,289
Come back around 2:00 p.m.
the day after tomorrow.

397
00:29:54,125 --> 00:29:55,894
By the way, I'm sorry.

398
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:58,263
It took a while to give you back
your friend's cellphone.

399
00:29:58,329 --> 00:30:00,665
No problem. Thank you, boss.

400
00:30:00,732 --> 00:30:02,734
Boss? Really?

401
00:30:07,005 --> 00:30:08,573
You don't have a boyfriend, right?

402
00:30:09,174 --> 00:30:10,475
You're too busy for that.

403
00:30:10,542 --> 00:30:14,279
And you probably don't have a girlfriend.
Because you're also too busy.

404
00:30:15,146 --> 00:30:16,681
No matter how busy you are,

405
00:30:16,748 --> 00:30:21,319
you will find a way
to be the one you love.

406
00:30:32,463 --> 00:30:35,533
-Where are you going?
-Doc, the ambulance got stuck in traffic.

407
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:38,469
We have a dengue patient
who has thrombocytopenia.

408
00:30:38,536 --> 00:30:40,238
He needs a platelet transfusion.

409
00:30:40,305 --> 00:30:44,776
Doc, we already searched for a motorcycle
so we can weave through traffic.

410
00:30:45,410 --> 00:30:46,678
I have a motorcycle.

411
00:30:49,814 --> 00:30:51,616
-We'll take it there.
-Come on.

412
00:30:57,388 --> 00:30:58,857
Is this your first time to back-ride?

413
00:31:00,458 --> 00:31:01,326
Yes.

414
00:31:03,061 --> 00:31:04,295
Just hold tight.

415
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:29,821
Are you okay?

416
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:31,689
Yes.

417
00:31:33,992 --> 00:31:36,427
Can we still get through that?
Traffic is too heavy.

418
00:31:36,494 --> 00:31:38,363
We need to bring this to the patient.

419
00:31:40,064 --> 00:31:41,132
I'll just pull over.

420
00:32:23,207 --> 00:32:25,977
Just some brotherly advice.
Don't waste your life.

421
00:32:26,044 --> 00:32:27,912
It's not too late for you to change.

422
00:32:29,747 --> 00:32:32,350
But you're not a soldier.
You're an accountant, right?

423
00:32:32,417 --> 00:32:34,485
<i>Next week, let's go out on a date.</i>

424
00:32:46,364 --> 00:32:48,066
<i>If that's how you feel,</i>

425
00:32:48,132 --> 00:32:51,002
it's just right to follow him
so you can be sure.

426
00:32:51,602 --> 00:32:54,172
<i>Remember, you've had</i>
<i>enough of men like that.</i>

427
00:32:54,238 --> 00:32:56,541
<i>Who makes you fall in love,</i>
<i>but then has other commitments.</i>

428
00:32:56,607 --> 00:33:02,213
I dare Lucas to be on that list
of men who fooled me and lied to me.

429
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:04,082
I will operate on him
while he's wide awake.

430
00:33:04,148 --> 00:33:07,018
Big Boss. Five seconds. Seven o'clock.

431
00:33:07,085 --> 00:33:09,187
<i>What's your business here</i>
<i>in Camp Aguinaldo?</i>

432
00:33:09,253 --> 00:33:10,822
<i>Are you following me?</i>

433
00:33:10,888 --> 00:33:13,658
Answer my question first.
Why are you here?
