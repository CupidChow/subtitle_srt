1
00:00:11,244 --> 00:00:14,414
<i>I won't allow you to leave</i>
<i>without talking to me, Diego.</i>

2
00:00:18,151 --> 00:00:21,054
Moira had an accident. I need to see her.

3
00:00:21,121 --> 00:00:24,257
Give my regards to her.
Be back by 1700 hours, okay?

4
00:00:24,324 --> 00:00:26,926
I'm sorry, I don't have
the courage to face you yet.

5
00:00:26,993 --> 00:00:30,130
<i>Someday, you will know why.</i>

6
00:00:30,196 --> 00:00:32,499
We'll be deployed six months.
Are you sure you can do it?

7
00:00:32,565 --> 00:00:35,835
We're used to it.
How about Doc Maxine? Did you call her?

8
00:00:35,902 --> 00:00:38,705
If she doesn't like me,
there's nothing I can do about it.

9
00:00:38,772 --> 00:00:39,873
We're over, remember?

10
00:00:39,939 --> 00:00:42,008
But you didn't give him a chance.

11
00:00:42,075 --> 00:00:44,110
<i>I was the one who got fooled and hurt.</i>

12
00:00:44,177 --> 00:00:46,913
If he was serious about me,
he wouldn't take no for an answer.

13
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:47,814
But is he here now?

14
00:00:48,915 --> 00:00:50,984
Thank you for coming
because it's getting tense here.

15
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:54,587
He is Jimmy. He will update you
about the PRG's every move here in Urdan.

16
00:00:54,654 --> 00:00:56,990
We have the same goal, to crush PRG.

17
00:00:57,057 --> 00:01:00,126
For our country and for my father as well.

18
00:01:13,773 --> 00:01:17,977
Don't force it, Captain Moira.
You're still weak.

19
00:01:18,044 --> 00:01:21,114
Okay. Please get my phone.

20
00:01:21,181 --> 00:01:23,583
Okay. I'll just get your things.

21
00:01:55,982 --> 00:01:57,350
This is Diego's, right?

22
00:01:57,417 --> 00:02:00,820
Was he here? When? What did he say?

23
00:02:00,887 --> 00:02:03,189
Yesterday, Captain,

24
00:02:03,256 --> 00:02:05,792
but he didn't stay long
and didn't say anything.

25
00:02:08,661 --> 00:02:11,164
-Thank you.
-I'll just get the charger.

26
00:02:16,603 --> 00:02:18,738
<i>I know you still love me, Diego.</i>

27
00:02:19,405 --> 00:02:22,842
<i>I don't know why you won't talk to me.</i>

28
00:02:22,909 --> 00:02:25,678
<i>But I know you worry about me.</i>

29
00:02:27,113 --> 00:02:29,048
<i>I'll recover Diego.</i>

30
00:02:30,283 --> 00:02:31,885
<i>We'll still see each other.</i>

31
00:03:03,449 --> 00:03:07,487
Yes, a person can die
because of a broken heart.

32
00:03:07,554 --> 00:03:11,424
This is what you call
Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy

33
00:03:11,491 --> 00:03:12,725
or Broken Heart Syndrome.

34
00:03:12,792 --> 00:03:16,362
It is commonly described
as a physical pain in the chest,

35
00:03:16,429 --> 00:03:20,233
heart or stomach area
due to emotional stress…

36
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:26,606
Love is indeed powerful, Doctor.
It can even cause death.

37
00:03:26,673 --> 00:03:28,007
That's true.

38
00:03:28,074 --> 00:03:32,011
If you ask me,
moving on is what you should do.

39
00:03:32,078 --> 00:03:36,216
Don't trust men especially
those who just lead you on.

40
00:03:36,282 --> 00:03:39,485
The doctor is speaking
from experience again.

41
00:03:41,087 --> 00:03:43,022
No.

42
00:03:43,089 --> 00:03:45,291
<i>I just don't like guys</i>
<i>who just lead you on.</i>

43
00:03:55,168 --> 00:03:59,138
Your emotive statements
are making our hospital popular.

44
00:04:01,774 --> 00:04:03,176
I accepted the show

45
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:07,080
because I want to give back
to the people through what I know.

46
00:04:27,734 --> 00:04:31,671
I know this is a bit much to ask,
but I hope someone volunteers.

47
00:04:31,738 --> 00:04:35,375
Volunteer for how many months, sir?

48
00:04:39,012 --> 00:04:40,313
There's also minimal allowance.

49
00:04:45,852 --> 00:04:49,188
Okay, sir. I'll ask around
but for sure there'll be volunteers.

50
00:05:03,002 --> 00:05:06,005
-I'll see you later. Thank you.
-All right. Bye.

51
00:05:20,953 --> 00:05:22,288
Urdan?

52
00:05:25,191 --> 00:05:28,928
Look. Urdan is beautiful, right?

53
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:30,163
See?

54
00:05:30,229 --> 00:05:31,631
Yes, it's a nice place.

55
00:05:32,932 --> 00:05:38,137
You know, if I were still single,
I'd volunteer for that project.

56
00:05:40,873 --> 00:05:44,644
Wait. By the way,
did Lucas contact you already?

57
00:05:45,144 --> 00:05:46,679
Thank God, not yet.

58
00:05:46,746 --> 00:05:52,085
And please, don't mention him anymore.
I don't want to hear his name.

59
00:05:52,752 --> 00:05:53,786
I'm sorry.

60
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:57,423
I just feel sorry for what happened
between the two of you.

61
00:05:57,490 --> 00:06:00,560
I thought you two had a chance
because you look good together.

62
00:06:01,327 --> 00:06:02,862
Excuse me?

63
00:06:02,929 --> 00:06:06,065
He doesn't deserve women like me, okay?

64
00:06:06,132 --> 00:06:08,434
Wow. Aren't you confident?

65
00:06:08,501 --> 00:06:09,769
Why?

66
00:06:10,636 --> 00:06:12,605
What if he comes back?

67
00:06:13,306 --> 00:06:16,409
What if he turns up again?

68
00:06:16,476 --> 00:06:22,181
Even if he begs that we patch
things up, he won't get anything.

69
00:06:22,248 --> 00:06:24,684
He'll just have a hard time
because he won't find me.

70
00:06:25,351 --> 00:06:26,519
Why is that?

71
00:06:27,653 --> 00:06:28,755
Because…

72
00:06:29,689 --> 00:06:32,692
I've just decided to volunteer in Urdan.

73
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:33,760
What?

74
00:06:34,694 --> 00:06:36,963
Are you sure about that?

75
00:06:37,029 --> 00:06:39,866
Earlier, I wasn't.
But now I'm sure about it.

76
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,735
And I don't want to see
that Lucas anymore.

77
00:06:43,436 --> 00:06:46,272
So, this volunteer work…

78
00:06:48,641 --> 00:06:49,976
Exactly!

79
00:06:50,743 --> 00:06:53,880
Maybe it's about time
that I listen to the universe.

80
00:06:55,782 --> 00:06:56,849
Right?

81
00:06:56,916 --> 00:07:01,687
Who knows? This might be the best decision
I will ever make in life, right?

82
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:02,855
Okay.

83
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:25,938
Let's help.

84
00:08:31,811 --> 00:08:33,779
Sir, are you okay?

85
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:36,415
Where are you taking this?

86
00:09:12,184 --> 00:09:13,920
Thank you, sir.

87
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,422
Coffee?

88
00:09:16,489 --> 00:09:18,925
That's okay.
The troops still have to go somewhere.

89
00:09:18,991 --> 00:09:22,762
By the way, I'm Captain Lucas Manalo.
We are the First Special Forces.

90
00:09:22,828 --> 00:09:24,597
If you need anything,

91
00:09:24,664 --> 00:09:27,099
the camp is ready to serve you
twenty-four seven.

92
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:29,835
I thought you said
you'd lie low for our child.

93
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:41,314
I already started this battle.

94
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:44,717
I'm begging you, not now.

95
00:09:44,784 --> 00:09:46,118
Please, I am asking you.

96
00:09:47,653 --> 00:09:48,521
Not now.

97
00:09:51,657 --> 00:09:54,260
-Thank you. Maybe next time.
-Thank you, sir. I hope so.

98
00:09:54,327 --> 00:09:55,861
-Take care.
-Thank you, sir.

99
00:10:14,347 --> 00:10:17,683
<i>What? Will I have a son-in-law</i>
<i>when I come back there?</i>

100
00:10:20,353 --> 00:10:22,421
I have no time for that, mom.

101
00:10:22,488 --> 00:10:25,257
I don't even have enough time
for the hospital.

102
00:10:25,324 --> 00:10:28,995
<i>Why don't you install</i>
<i>a dating app in your phone?</i>

103
00:10:29,061 --> 00:10:32,098
Who knows?
Maybe you're true love is online.

104
00:10:32,164 --> 00:10:35,468
<i>I don't believe</i>
<i>in online love affairs, Mom.</i>

105
00:10:35,534 --> 00:10:37,670
Forever does not exist in cyberspace.

106
00:10:38,838 --> 00:10:42,341
Just go out on dates.
Don't waste your beauty genes.

107
00:10:44,176 --> 00:10:46,379
Okay, Mom.

108
00:10:46,445 --> 00:10:49,915
I'll download that dating app
so you will stop bothering me.

109
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:52,084
<i>And you can stop bugging me.</i>

110
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:53,619
Right!

111
00:11:03,529 --> 00:11:07,266
Urdan? Where is that?
Isn't that off the grid?

112
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:12,538
You're terrible. It's not.
It's in the Visayas region.

113
00:11:12,605 --> 00:11:13,906
It's a beautiful place, Mom.

114
00:11:13,973 --> 00:11:19,245
<i>New energy, new environment</i>
<i>and new challenges for me.</i>

115
00:11:20,112 --> 00:11:21,480
That's good, my dear.

116
00:11:25,751 --> 00:11:29,321
And maybe you will find
your 'forever' there.

117
00:11:29,989 --> 00:11:31,323
You're not making sense, Mom.

118
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:36,062
<i>Goodbye, my dear.</i>

119
00:12:00,252 --> 00:12:02,254
This is the Waris River, right?

120
00:12:03,823 --> 00:12:05,725
Be on the lookout on the main highway.

121
00:12:06,592 --> 00:12:09,428
That's the primary route
of the PRG going to their camp.

122
00:12:09,495 --> 00:12:11,831
-Good day, sir.
-Good day.

123
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:17,970
No slipping, troop.

124
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:20,106
One hundred pushups if you do.

125
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,609
-Still no catch yet?
-Yes.

126
00:12:26,445 --> 00:12:27,880
You'll catch some, later.

127
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:38,457
Help! A kid is drowning!

128
00:12:39,024 --> 00:12:40,493
-Help!
-Help!

129
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:41,827
That kid is drowning!

130
00:12:42,828 --> 00:12:43,662
Help us!

131
00:12:46,165 --> 00:12:47,500
Help!

132
00:12:49,502 --> 00:12:50,603
Help!

133
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,542
You are safe now.

134
00:13:29,608 --> 00:13:30,476
What's your name?

135
00:13:30,543 --> 00:13:31,710
Biboy.

136
00:13:31,777 --> 00:13:33,145
Biboy, just relax.

137
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:34,547
Okay.

138
00:13:41,787 --> 00:13:44,690
Is your house near here?
Where are your parents?

139
00:13:44,757 --> 00:13:46,759
It's nearby.

140
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:50,863
I was just crossing the river
but I accidentally slipped.

141
00:13:53,232 --> 00:13:56,535
-Biboy!
-Mother.

142
00:13:57,603 --> 00:14:00,339
Thank God you're safe.

143
00:14:03,042 --> 00:14:05,144
You guys helped my kid?

144
00:14:07,746 --> 00:14:10,216
Thank you for helping us.

145
00:14:10,282 --> 00:14:12,685
We're always here to help.

146
00:14:16,121 --> 00:14:19,792
We must head back to camp
before it gets dark.

147
00:14:20,326 --> 00:14:21,760
Why don't you come to our house?

148
00:14:22,595 --> 00:14:26,932
Please have a meal there
so I can repay what you did for my child.

149
00:14:26,999 --> 00:14:30,102
-Don't mention it.
-That sounds good.

150
00:14:30,169 --> 00:14:31,871
There's no need to bother.

151
00:14:31,937 --> 00:14:33,706
-Maybe next time.
-Thank you anyway.

152
00:14:33,772 --> 00:14:35,474
-We must get going.
-But it's still early.

153
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:36,475
Please?

154
00:14:45,084 --> 00:14:46,285
-Should we go?
-Yes, sir.

155
00:14:46,352 --> 00:14:49,154
Perfect timing. Picollo is very hungry.

156
00:14:50,322 --> 00:14:51,957
Let's go. Which way is it, ma'am?

157
00:14:58,664 --> 00:15:00,633
-This is delicious.
-I'm starving.

158
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:02,134
What is this?

159
00:15:02,201 --> 00:15:04,603
You don't have that in Manila, huh?

160
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:06,138
We also call that "puto."

161
00:15:06,205 --> 00:15:11,076
It's made of cassava and coconut.

162
00:15:11,143 --> 00:15:13,245
-It's good, isn't it?
-Oh, it's good.

163
00:15:13,312 --> 00:15:14,813
It's really good.

164
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,249
-It's my first time eating this.
-Have some more, buddy.

165
00:15:17,316 --> 00:15:20,019
Miss Sheila,
can we bring some back to the camp?

166
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:21,053
Yes, of course.

167
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,422
-Buddy, you're embarrassing.
-Hey.

168
00:15:23,489 --> 00:15:26,692
-That's okay. No worries.
-She said it's okay.

169
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:29,628
-Thank you. We'll bring some.
-There's not much left, buddy.

170
00:15:29,695 --> 00:15:32,765
-I'll have some more.
-Go ahead.

171
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:35,467
We can have more.

172
00:15:35,534 --> 00:15:36,869
How's Biboy?

173
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:38,170
He's sleeping now.

174
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:39,605
That's good.

175
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:43,342
-Sheila!
-Yes?

176
00:15:46,545 --> 00:15:47,513
Where's Biboy?

177
00:15:48,247 --> 00:15:49,448
They told me he almost drowned?

178
00:15:49,515 --> 00:15:52,151
He's safe now.

179
00:15:52,217 --> 00:15:54,153
Thanks to Captain Lucas.

180
00:15:57,356 --> 00:15:58,624
Good thing you came.

181
00:15:59,425 --> 00:16:01,327
Thank you for saving my son.

182
00:16:02,494 --> 00:16:05,798
The PRG can't bother us now.

183
00:16:23,882 --> 00:16:25,884
The PRG comes here?

184
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:29,421
They are messing with our lives.

185
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:35,794
They get our food, poultry,
vegetables, and rice.

186
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:40,265
They are destroying our lives
and this town.

187
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:15,434
Good afternoon, Boss Rodel.

188
00:17:15,501 --> 00:17:17,269
-Good afternoon.
-Janet.

189
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:19,271
You just arrived?

190
00:17:19,338 --> 00:17:22,908
Yes. The jeep we were riding broke down,
and the trip was delayed.

191
00:17:23,409 --> 00:17:26,345
You passed by the military camp?
They sent reinforcements.

192
00:17:26,945 --> 00:17:28,147
Yes, I saw them.

193
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:30,482
But they shouldn't be too careful, Greg,

194
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:33,919
because I'll also strengthen
our force here in Urdan.

195
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:48,534
I agreed to return here
because I thought you'd be laying low.

196
00:17:49,368 --> 00:17:51,703
That you won't make any move
until I give birth.

197
00:17:52,771 --> 00:17:54,306
What happened to your promise?

198
00:17:54,973 --> 00:17:57,276
Janet, I understand you.

199
00:17:57,342 --> 00:17:59,411
But I can't turn my back on
the people here,

200
00:17:59,478 --> 00:18:01,346
especially now
there are more military troops.

201
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:03,248
I don't want to be in any danger, Rodel,

202
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:05,951
especially for our baby.

203
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:18,897
Janet, I won't allow danger come near you.

204
00:18:18,964 --> 00:18:20,866
Of course,
I will protect you and our child.

205
00:18:25,737 --> 00:18:27,840
I really hope this will all end soon…

206
00:18:29,074 --> 00:18:30,876
so we can start a new life.

207
00:18:32,845 --> 00:18:35,047
And so you can reunite
with your sister too.

208
00:18:46,558 --> 00:18:48,727
Someday, Maxine and I will see each other.

209
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:55,033
She'll understand why I'm doing this.

210
00:19:34,806 --> 00:19:35,807
Doctor?

211
00:19:35,874 --> 00:19:37,109
Did you volunteer?

212
00:19:42,214 --> 00:19:45,684
And I was a doctor in the neighborhood
when I was just starting.

213
00:19:45,751 --> 00:19:50,022
What about your TV show?
And your patients?

214
00:19:50,088 --> 00:19:52,324
The hospital has a lot of doctors.
They can handle that.

215
00:19:52,391 --> 00:19:55,627
What about your application
for the chief resident position?

216
00:19:56,395 --> 00:19:57,963
That can wait.

217
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:00,966
Then, we will definitely enjoy it
because we'll all be together.

218
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:03,168
All the beautiful ladies will be together.

219
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:06,939
I'm excited already. That'll be fun.

220
00:20:12,344 --> 00:20:14,980
The members of the medical team
are arriving tomorrow afternoon.

221
00:20:15,847 --> 00:20:17,649
Here is the list of their names.

222
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:24,089
From St. Mary's, Earl Jimeno.

223
00:20:24,156 --> 00:20:27,960
Also from St. Mary's.
Ralph Vergara, Via Catindig.

224
00:20:28,026 --> 00:20:30,262
Maxine Dela Cruz.

225
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:33,098
Doctor Maxine…

226
00:20:36,168 --> 00:20:37,703
Doc Maxine is part of the group?

227
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:41,273
It's indeed a small world.

228
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:42,908
Dr. Maxine Dela Cruz.

229
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:47,846
You'll see each other again.

230
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:49,615
And she'll be here for six months.

231
00:20:49,681 --> 00:20:50,983
What now?

232
00:20:54,486 --> 00:20:57,289
What do you mean?
It's nothing to worry about.

233
00:20:59,391 --> 00:21:01,393
It's just work, nothing personal.

234
00:21:09,835 --> 00:21:11,203
Wow.

235
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:21,980
Thank heavens.
We're finally here after three hours.

236
00:21:22,681 --> 00:21:25,117
Shut up. You just slept the entire trip.

237
00:21:26,018 --> 00:21:30,055
What happens now?
Our plane's left already.

238
00:24:46,518 --> 00:24:49,688
Welcome to Urdan. I'm the one
in charge of your safety here.

239
00:24:58,563 --> 00:25:02,601
I'm sorry.
The plane can't land in our destination.

240
00:25:02,667 --> 00:25:03,869
So we need to take a chopper.

241
00:25:03,935 --> 00:25:08,306
It means you can't bring your luggage,
just the essentials.

242
00:25:08,907 --> 00:25:13,345
We can have it picked up
once we take you to the Urdan town proper.

243
00:25:13,411 --> 00:25:15,280
Okay? Here are your bags.

244
00:25:16,114 --> 00:25:17,883
Put your essentials there.

245
00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:20,619
You have ten minutes to pack.

246
00:25:50,115 --> 00:25:51,750
This belongs to you, right?

247
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:52,944
This is the Medicube.

248
00:26:55,013 --> 00:26:59,651
This is the only hospital in Urdan.
The people of Urdan want to thank you.

249
00:26:59,718 --> 00:27:02,220
It's a pity you and Dr. Maxine
didn't have the chance to talk.

250
00:27:02,287 --> 00:27:05,624
<i>I'm here to lead this military camp</i>
<i>and to help the people of Urdan.</i>

251
00:27:07,626 --> 00:27:10,161
Such bad luck that we meet again here.

252
00:27:10,228 --> 00:27:12,063
Is that why you're going back to Manila?

253
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:14,332
I don't want to see his face.

254
00:27:14,399 --> 00:27:16,401
And it's not healthy
that we're here together.

255
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:19,471
There's a reported sighting
of PRG members here.

256
00:27:19,537 --> 00:27:22,173
And a landmine exploded the other day.

257
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,776
Don't trust just anyone.

258
00:27:24,843 --> 00:27:26,945
We don't know who our friends
and who our enemies are.

259
00:27:27,012 --> 00:27:28,947
I'm surprised you know the word "trust."

260
00:27:29,014 --> 00:27:31,916
I did that before but you just lied to me.

261
00:27:31,983 --> 00:27:33,318
Liar.

262
00:27:33,385 --> 00:27:35,754
-What is going on there?
-It's a medical mission.
