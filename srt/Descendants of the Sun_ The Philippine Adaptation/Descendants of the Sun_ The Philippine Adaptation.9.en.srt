1
00:00:11,277 --> 00:00:14,214
This is the Medicube,
the makeshift hospital here in Urdan.

2
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:16,983
We're all here to give
assistance to the community.

3
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:21,755
-Such bad luck that we meet again here.
-Is that why you're going back to Manila?

4
00:00:21,821 --> 00:00:23,323
Did I say flights are only once a week?

5
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:25,792
-You can't scare me.
-So, do you believe now, Doc?

6
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:28,962
You're not only kind, Dr. Maxine.
You're also very pretty.

7
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:34,067
-<i>Beautiful.</i>
-I have a lot of neighbors who are sick.

8
00:00:34,134 --> 00:00:35,802
I hope you can also help them.

9
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:37,670
Is your place far from here?

10
00:00:37,737 --> 00:00:40,440
<i>It's just across five rivers.</i>

11
00:00:40,507 --> 00:00:42,776
-What's going on there?
-It's a medical mission.

12
00:00:42,842 --> 00:00:45,712
-A lot of people here are sick.
-<i>You know that's dangerous.</i>

13
00:00:45,779 --> 00:00:48,014
You can get kidnapped
if you go out of the camp.

14
00:00:48,081 --> 00:00:50,750
Next time you're leaving,
ask permission from the staff, okay?

15
00:00:50,817 --> 00:00:52,118
I can handle myself.

16
00:00:52,185 --> 00:00:55,422
Even if you hadn't found me,
I'd have found my way back.

17
00:00:55,488 --> 00:00:56,756
<i>I don't need you.</i>

18
00:00:56,823 --> 00:00:59,659
-Maxine, don't move.
-You stepped on a landmine.

19
00:01:07,367 --> 00:01:08,435
What?

20
00:01:08,501 --> 00:01:10,537
What am I going to do?

21
00:01:10,603 --> 00:01:12,439
-Don't move.
-I'll die, Lucas.

22
00:01:12,505 --> 00:01:14,474
You're panicking. Just relax.
Don't move your foot.

23
00:01:14,541 --> 00:01:16,976
Don't leave me here. Just stay here!

24
00:01:17,043 --> 00:01:18,912
Okay. Don't move your foot.

25
00:01:20,613 --> 00:01:23,049
Are you okay? Just relax.
Don't move too much.

26
00:01:23,683 --> 00:01:24,884
I'll step on it instead.

27
00:01:53,246 --> 00:01:54,147
How dare you!

28
00:01:56,149 --> 00:01:57,717
You're really a liar!

29
00:01:58,885 --> 00:02:00,120
That wasn't funny.

30
00:02:03,189 --> 00:02:05,091
You're so stubborn.
You wouldn't listen to me.

31
00:02:06,926 --> 00:02:08,161
So stubborn.

32
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:00,914
Boss, I'll head to the barracks.

33
00:03:02,215 --> 00:03:03,116
Okay.

34
00:03:13,459 --> 00:03:14,527
Did you patch things up?

35
00:03:17,163 --> 00:03:20,733
Why is she even here?
She's a real handful.

36
00:03:23,002 --> 00:03:25,138
Why are you so affected?

37
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:29,642
Didn't you say to me
that you don't care about her anymore?

38
00:03:34,614 --> 00:03:35,748
Did I say that?

39
00:03:35,815 --> 00:03:36,649
Yes.

40
00:03:46,593 --> 00:03:48,995
That Lucas is such a jerk.

41
00:03:49,629 --> 00:03:51,965
He's so arrogant and proud.

42
00:03:53,433 --> 00:03:56,302
Good thing, we're no longer together.

43
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:58,071
Were you a couple, Doc?

44
00:04:03,376 --> 00:04:06,546
Good thing we didn't become a couple.

45
00:04:07,814 --> 00:04:08,848
Good thing.

46
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:10,917
So, he has a bad attitude.

47
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:13,920
Capt. Lucas seems nice.

48
00:04:14,821 --> 00:04:16,022
And he's cute too.

49
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:20,627
Don't let yourselves be deceived by him.

50
00:04:21,527 --> 00:04:24,564
He pretends to be nice
but he's really a jerk.

51
00:04:24,631 --> 00:04:26,466
He's such a liar.

52
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:30,436
Are you being emotional again, Doctor?

53
00:04:30,503 --> 00:04:32,238
You're not on a TV show anymore.

54
00:04:32,305 --> 00:04:34,240
Such loaded words.

55
00:04:34,307 --> 00:04:35,141
That's true.

56
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:40,513
But admit it, Doc.
He followed you to Sitio Santos.

57
00:04:42,649 --> 00:04:44,617
Isn't that sweet?

58
00:04:44,684 --> 00:04:49,188
I hope somebody also rescues me
if I get lost in the forest.

59
00:04:49,255 --> 00:04:53,059
Someone as good looking
and as charming as Capt. Lucas.

60
00:04:54,027 --> 00:04:59,232
-Men like him are rare.
-Anyway, I only have to endure for a bit.

61
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:01,567
Because I'll fly back to Manila next week.

62
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:05,438
And does that Lucas think
he's the only one who can play a prank?

63
00:05:08,207 --> 00:05:09,442
We'll see about that.

64
00:05:12,045 --> 00:05:13,279
He messed with the wrong person.

65
00:05:45,244 --> 00:05:48,481
How many times do I have to tell you that?
You never listen.

66
00:05:48,548 --> 00:05:51,884
I don't understand why you don't like him.

67
00:05:55,421 --> 00:05:57,790
But you won't gain anything from him.

68
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:01,794
You even have a higher rank than him.

69
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:06,065
But I choose him.

70
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:08,434
I know he loves me.

71
00:06:15,007 --> 00:06:17,844
I love him and even
if you don't like him, I still love him.

72
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:34,761
Okay, ma'am, just press it.

73
00:06:34,827 --> 00:06:36,062
Thank you.

74
00:06:46,873 --> 00:06:48,040
For you.

75
00:06:48,775 --> 00:06:51,010
Oh my. Biboy is so sweet.

76
00:06:52,145 --> 00:06:54,947
Doc, do you eat sweet potatoes?

77
00:06:55,014 --> 00:06:58,351
We have a lot at home.
Do you want me to bring you some?

78
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:00,353
No need. Your family should have it.

79
00:07:01,387 --> 00:07:02,855
Where is your mother?

80
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:04,757
She went to the toilet.

81
00:07:04,824 --> 00:07:08,027
When she gets back,
I'll give you a check-up.

82
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:08,961
Okay.

83
00:07:09,028 --> 00:07:11,397
I don't cry anymore
when I go for check-ups.

84
00:07:11,464 --> 00:07:12,665
I'm a good boy now.

85
00:07:12,732 --> 00:07:13,599
Really?

86
00:07:13,666 --> 00:07:15,635
I'm no longer scared of those needles.

87
00:07:15,701 --> 00:07:17,703
-Really?
-I'm brave.

88
00:07:18,905 --> 00:07:21,941
If you say so. I believe you.

89
00:07:22,008 --> 00:07:23,209
Doc Maxine!

90
00:07:23,776 --> 00:07:26,379
Now we can give hepatitis B shots
to the soldiers

91
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:28,548
because our supplies just arrived.

92
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:33,719
Great. Okay.
We can do it after after clinic hours.

93
00:07:33,786 --> 00:07:35,354
Please inform Captain Lucas.

94
00:07:35,421 --> 00:07:36,756
All right, Doc.

95
00:07:40,193 --> 00:07:41,127
Captain?

96
00:07:43,596 --> 00:07:45,631
No one will cry, okay?

97
00:07:45,698 --> 00:07:48,067
Maybe later someone will cry,
be ashamed of yourself.

98
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:50,369
-We won't.
-And nobody can pass out.

99
00:07:50,436 --> 00:07:51,571
-We won't.
-Who goes first?

100
00:07:51,637 --> 00:07:53,439
-Not me.
-How about him?

101
00:07:53,506 --> 00:07:55,675
-You should go first.
-Come on.

102
00:07:55,741 --> 00:07:58,678
Whoever cries will do a hundred push-ups.

103
00:07:59,345 --> 00:08:02,748
Oh, no, buddy.
Can you do a hundred push-ups?

104
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:03,950
You're scared of that, right?

105
00:08:05,284 --> 00:08:07,119
Sorry, just kidding.

106
00:08:07,186 --> 00:08:13,092
-Cry baby!
-Cry baby!

107
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:16,596
If you two don't shut up,
you'll be the ones crying.

108
00:08:16,662 --> 00:08:19,665
We will cry!

109
00:08:19,732 --> 00:08:21,534
-Why don't you go first?
-You first, Marty.

110
00:08:21,601 --> 00:08:23,603
-Why me?
-Talledo, you go first.

111
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:26,072
-Wait! Why me?
-Because you're the youngest.

112
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:29,709
-Hey, Big Boss.
-Should we fall in line?

113
00:08:29,775 --> 00:08:31,210
It's going to be Marty.

114
00:08:32,144 --> 00:08:33,012
He can go first.

115
00:08:33,079 --> 00:08:34,881
-It's an order from Big Boss.
-Come on. Hurry.

116
00:08:34,947 --> 00:08:37,750
-Marty, you're being too fussy.
-You're the nearest one there.

117
00:08:37,817 --> 00:08:39,118
Lucas, should you go first?

118
00:08:41,954 --> 00:08:45,424
-Cry baby!
-Big Boss is going first.

119
00:08:47,493 --> 00:08:48,728
Take a seat.

120
00:08:48,794 --> 00:08:50,696
-Go ahead, Big Boss.
-That's nothing.

121
00:08:50,763 --> 00:08:52,565
He's not afraid of anything.

122
00:08:52,632 --> 00:08:53,499
Okay.

123
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:57,403
That's just a small needle.

124
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:09,348
How many shots?

125
00:09:11,817 --> 00:09:13,286
-What?
-How many shots?

126
00:09:13,352 --> 00:09:14,387
-Just one.
-Just one?

127
00:09:14,453 --> 00:09:16,756
Yes. This will be quick.

128
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:20,593
All right. Whoever's next should prepare.

129
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:22,595
-It's Talledo.
-You're next.

130
00:09:23,162 --> 00:09:24,397
You're next.

131
00:09:37,143 --> 00:09:38,711
Is it supposed to be that big?

132
00:10:09,642 --> 00:10:11,410
It will feel just like an ant bite.

133
00:10:18,851 --> 00:10:19,785
Yes.

134
00:10:27,059 --> 00:10:28,461
-You count.
-I'll count?

135
00:10:28,527 --> 00:10:30,696
Do you want them to? Of course, it's you.

136
00:10:43,242 --> 00:10:46,012
The vaccine is a bit thick
so the needle stays longer.

137
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:49,515
Emma, do we have more of these?

138
00:10:49,582 --> 00:10:51,817
Yes. Dr. Earl has some.

139
00:10:52,918 --> 00:10:55,488
-Dr. Earl?
-Yes.

140
00:10:55,554 --> 00:10:57,189
Can I have some more of these, please?

141
00:10:57,256 --> 00:10:58,257
All right.

142
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:00,993
Nurse Emma, please prepare the cotton.

143
00:11:07,433 --> 00:11:09,935
-Are you okay?
-What?

144
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:11,671
Why do you look like you're about to cry?

145
00:11:16,008 --> 00:11:18,911
Emma, we have smaller needles, right?

146
00:11:18,978 --> 00:11:21,213
-Yes, we have a lot.
-Let's use those for the next shots.

147
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:23,082
That's great!

148
00:11:28,821 --> 00:11:30,623
It's not that painful, right?

149
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:31,524
No.

150
00:11:57,149 --> 00:11:58,918
-Dr. Earl?
-Yes.

151
00:11:59,452 --> 00:12:01,053
Is there really no water in the shower?

152
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,055
There was.
We were all able to take a shower.

153
00:12:03,122 --> 00:12:05,858
-Then why is nothing coming out?
-There should be.

154
00:12:25,911 --> 00:12:27,279
Is there no water supply?

155
00:12:27,346 --> 00:12:29,882
There's a problem with the pipeline.
They're fixing it now.

156
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:33,919
Where can I fetch water?

157
00:12:35,287 --> 00:12:36,489
By the water tank.

158
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:40,726
Is there any place that's near?

159
00:12:41,327 --> 00:12:42,328
None.

160
00:12:42,394 --> 00:12:43,629
I'll go ahead. We have drills.

161
00:13:49,261 --> 00:13:50,129
You seem busy.

162
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:52,998
It's none of your business.

163
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:57,403
Let me help you.

164
00:13:57,469 --> 00:13:59,438
No. No need, I'm okay.

165
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:00,773
-Really?
-Yes.

166
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:04,043
I'm almost done filling up that drum.

167
00:14:04,109 --> 00:14:05,678
Just one more trip.

168
00:14:05,744 --> 00:14:07,246
Too bad. I was planning to help you.

169
00:14:07,313 --> 00:14:08,747
Don't bother.

170
00:15:10,442 --> 00:15:11,677
It was just turned off.

171
00:15:24,657 --> 00:15:25,925
Sure you don't need help?

172
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:53,018
IT'S CONFIRMED.

173
00:15:53,085 --> 00:15:55,721
THE CENTER OF RECRUITMENT OF PRG
IS IN SITIO SANTO DOMINGO.

174
00:16:10,703 --> 00:16:11,904
That is our target…

175
00:16:12,738 --> 00:16:14,273
Sitio Santo Domingo.

176
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:19,345
According to our asset,
it's a primary base and training ground

177
00:16:19,411 --> 00:16:21,981
of young recruits of the enemy.

178
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:30,789
Alpha team,
we cannot relax while in the area.

179
00:16:30,856 --> 00:16:33,058
This is the hot spot
of terrorist activities.

180
00:18:08,587 --> 00:18:09,455
Janet.

181
00:18:12,991 --> 00:18:14,293
Janet, wait.

182
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,895
If it's just me, Rodel,

183
00:18:17,629 --> 00:18:19,832
I'm not gonna get scared
fighting those soldiers.

184
00:18:19,898 --> 00:18:24,303
But we're having a baby soon.
What if something bad happens to our baby?

185
00:18:32,711 --> 00:18:35,481
I can protect you and our child.

186
00:18:35,547 --> 00:18:36,515
For how long?

187
00:18:36,582 --> 00:18:38,484
Our recruitment is on full blast

188
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:41,887
not only in Urdan
but even in other provinces.

189
00:18:42,855 --> 00:18:44,990
That's why the soldiers are after us.

190
00:18:56,001 --> 00:18:58,570
AFP's forces are getting stronger.

191
00:18:58,637 --> 00:19:00,539
Our world is getting smaller, Rodel.

192
00:19:00,606 --> 00:19:03,408
That's why I'm focusing
on our reinforcements here.

193
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:06,812
Besides, those soldiers
can't defeat us easily

194
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:09,515
because we have the support
of the International Extremist Group.

195
00:19:10,282 --> 00:19:12,117
So, stop worrying, Janet.

196
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:41,380
What if we get killed in the encounter?

197
00:19:43,415 --> 00:19:44,383
Janet…

198
00:19:46,385 --> 00:19:51,990
Rodel, let's just surrender while
we still have time. Please.

199
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:55,727
I'll die first before that happens!

200
00:20:18,016 --> 00:20:19,718
Are you the new recruits?

201
00:20:19,785 --> 00:20:20,919
Yes, Boss Rodel.

202
00:23:00,445 --> 00:23:03,248
This is great. It's really exciting here.

203
00:23:03,315 --> 00:23:05,650
The view is impressive.

204
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:06,918
I want to eat…

205
00:23:08,487 --> 00:23:09,354
the dishes,

206
00:23:09,421 --> 00:23:10,355
the vegetables.

207
00:23:10,422 --> 00:23:11,490
It's healthy.

208
00:23:12,391 --> 00:23:14,526
-Good for your health, right?
-Right.

209
00:23:15,994 --> 00:23:17,662
Where is Marty?

210
00:23:17,729 --> 00:23:19,197
Why is he not with them?

211
00:23:19,264 --> 00:23:23,168
Marty? You're really looking for Marty.

212
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:25,137
Marty…

213
00:23:25,971 --> 00:23:27,272
Why, you…

214
00:23:27,339 --> 00:23:30,442
Don't you think we should join them?
Our abs would be a waste.

215
00:23:30,509 --> 00:23:35,881
Yeah, it's a waste, our abs?

216
00:23:36,615 --> 00:23:41,253
But ours is just one-pack like a bread.

217
00:23:41,787 --> 00:23:43,922
Hey, don't be such killjoys!

218
00:24:07,946 --> 00:24:10,782
Are you and Captain Lucas
still in a fight, Doctor?

219
00:24:11,349 --> 00:24:12,217
He started it.

220
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:14,853
But you guys seem to enjoy it.

221
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:18,690
Maybe because whenever you fight,
you see each other.

222
00:24:20,058 --> 00:24:22,494
Whatever. I'm still mad at him.

223
00:24:22,561 --> 00:24:24,863
Anyway, I'm flying back
to Manila tomorrow.

224
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:26,431
Are you really leaving?

225
00:24:30,068 --> 00:24:33,405
Don't worry.
My replacement will be here soon.

226
00:24:33,472 --> 00:24:35,841
At least, someone
will treat the residents of Urdan.

227
00:26:00,992 --> 00:26:02,260
-Captain.
-Governor.

228
00:26:06,431 --> 00:26:09,100
Urdan has changed a lot
from the last time I was here.

229
00:26:11,369 --> 00:26:13,872
The town is slowly recovering.

230
00:26:15,907 --> 00:26:20,579
Kudos also to the medical team
for rehabilitating this place.

231
00:26:22,047 --> 00:26:24,149
Nothing is impossible
as long as we help each other.

232
00:26:27,052 --> 00:26:28,587
Governor, thank you very much.

233
00:26:28,653 --> 00:26:31,523
Your military vehicle is here.

234
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:33,658
We can start the site visit.

235
00:26:36,595 --> 00:26:37,462
You can sit in front.

236
00:27:06,758 --> 00:27:09,094
-I now have a ticket back to Manila.
-You're going to Manila?

237
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,795
Flights are just once a week, right?

238
00:27:10,862 --> 00:27:14,099
If I don't fly tomorrow,
I'll end up staying here longer.

239
00:27:14,666 --> 00:27:16,968
<i>And there's a lot of people</i>
<i>that need me in Manila.</i>

240
00:27:17,035 --> 00:27:18,637
<i>A lot of patients are waiting for me.</i>

241
00:27:18,703 --> 00:27:21,072
<i>Okay, team.</i>
<i>Let's be ready and more vigilant</i>

242
00:27:21,139 --> 00:27:22,941
<i>because they can attack us anytime.</i>
