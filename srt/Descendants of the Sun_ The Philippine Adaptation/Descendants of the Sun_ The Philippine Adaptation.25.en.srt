1
00:00:14,347 --> 00:00:15,949
<i>I don't know if you can hear me, but…</i>

2
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:20,220
<i>I want you to know</i>
<i>that I regret what I did.</i>

3
00:00:20,353 --> 00:00:24,124
<i>I want you to know</i>
<i>that I regret what I did.</i>

4
00:00:24,357 --> 00:00:25,425
<i>Please forgive me.</i>

5
00:00:25,658 --> 00:00:29,229
When she sincerely apologizes to you,
you should accept it.

6
00:00:29,295 --> 00:00:30,630
<i>Don't wait for her to get tired.</i>

7
00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:33,333
<i>Your two-way radio might become one-way.</i>

8
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:37,904
I hope Lucas' heart will also soften
after what he heard last night.

9
00:00:37,971 --> 00:00:39,973
<i>I'll set aside my issues with Lucas.</i>

10
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,875
<i>I'll prioritize my job.</i>

11
00:00:41,941 --> 00:00:44,077
I've checked
every possible place where he can go to.

12
00:00:44,144 --> 00:00:45,512
I can't find Bullet.

13
00:00:45,578 --> 00:00:49,049
If he's still alive,
he would have shown up by now.

14
00:00:49,115 --> 00:00:51,851
<i>I don't believe Bullet is dead.</i>

15
00:00:51,918 --> 00:00:55,388
We will find him
and we will continue the fight.

16
00:00:55,455 --> 00:01:00,226
Someone spotted Bullet and his wife
in the town across Hilarion Lake.

17
00:01:00,293 --> 00:01:05,865
We need to find them first thing tomorrow
before they bother people here again.

18
00:01:59,419 --> 00:02:00,487
Is this the location?

19
00:02:00,553 --> 00:02:02,355
This is the coordinates
given by our asset.

20
00:02:34,721 --> 00:02:35,922
There's no one here, Pistol.

21
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:38,358
We've looked all over.

22
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:40,293
Maybe Bullet is not here.

23
00:02:51,971 --> 00:02:53,006
Let's go there.

24
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:06,586
Isn't there anybody here we could ask?

25
00:03:08,121 --> 00:03:09,822
Does it look like anybody would live here?

26
00:03:10,823 --> 00:03:12,225
The rebels, of course.

27
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:15,361
This is where they choose to live
because it's secluded.

28
00:03:19,165 --> 00:03:20,200
The day is long.

29
00:03:26,673 --> 00:03:27,774
Are those dead bodies?

30
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:04,110
This one is a woman.

31
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:06,646
Could this be the Madame?

32
00:04:07,213 --> 00:04:08,414
Is that one a man?

33
00:04:09,215 --> 00:04:11,484
I can't say. It's badly burned.

34
00:04:14,954 --> 00:04:15,822
This is Bullet.

35
00:04:16,689 --> 00:04:18,157
How could you tell?

36
00:04:22,996 --> 00:04:23,930
This is his ring.

37
00:04:25,498 --> 00:04:26,499
I'm sure.

38
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:34,974
Who did this?

39
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:37,377
Maybe the soldiers did it.

40
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:38,745
The bastards!

41
00:04:38,811 --> 00:04:40,113
I know Bullet.

42
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:43,283
He will never let the soldiers
catch him alive.

43
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:46,185
Are you saying they killed themselves?

44
00:04:57,597 --> 00:04:59,866
Damn you, soldiers!

45
00:05:00,767 --> 00:05:03,369
We lost our leader because of them!

46
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:05,204
They will pay for this someday!

47
00:05:05,371 --> 00:05:06,239
They're animals!

48
00:05:39,939 --> 00:05:40,940
Someone's coming.

49
00:08:52,765 --> 00:08:54,033
LOA.

50
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:06,145
Nothing, sir. It was just a dog.

51
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:08,114
I wonder who fired those shots.

52
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:09,482
They're just in the area.

53
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:11,651
Let's continue searching.

54
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:13,586
That scared me.

55
00:09:13,653 --> 00:09:16,188
Pistol, what are we going to do with them?

56
00:09:17,023 --> 00:09:20,393
We'll give them a decent burial
to show our gratitude.

57
00:09:22,595 --> 00:09:27,166
Even in their final moments.

58
00:09:30,503 --> 00:09:36,842
Give them the honor and respect
for their contributions to the PRG.

59
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:55,995
Is that a human bone, sir?

60
00:09:57,263 --> 00:09:58,764
Isn't that too small?

61
00:09:58,831 --> 00:10:00,132
It doesn't look it.

62
00:10:30,763 --> 00:10:31,931
This is the place.

63
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:56,055
They're gone.

64
00:10:56,756 --> 00:10:57,990
Our leader is gone.

65
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:00,059
Those damn soldiers.

66
00:11:00,126 --> 00:11:02,361
They are the reason
why things ended this way.

67
00:11:02,428 --> 00:11:04,163
They'll get what's coming to them.

68
00:11:05,998 --> 00:11:08,801
They will pay for the deaths of Bullet,

69
00:11:09,435 --> 00:11:13,105
Madame, and our fallen comrades.

70
00:11:15,474 --> 00:11:18,678
Bullet and Madame
still live in our hearts.

71
00:11:19,445 --> 00:11:21,147
We will keep on fighting for them.

72
00:11:35,461 --> 00:11:38,431
We can remove your sutures
in a few days.

73
00:11:38,664 --> 00:11:39,598
Thank you, Doc.

74
00:11:39,665 --> 00:11:43,436
I'm really lucky
that you are taking care of me.

75
00:11:43,502 --> 00:11:45,237
-Oh, come on.
-I will definitely get well.

76
00:11:50,843 --> 00:11:53,546
Doc, it's already 1:30
and you still haven't had lunch yet.

77
00:11:53,612 --> 00:11:54,680
I'll take care of him.

78
00:11:54,747 --> 00:11:56,282
Okay, I'll just finish this.

79
00:11:57,049 --> 00:11:58,217
Let me do that, Doc.

80
00:11:58,818 --> 00:12:01,353
Even you shouldn't get sick
here in the Medicube.

81
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:03,656
We need your expertise as a doctor.

82
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:05,825
Come on, this won't take long.

83
00:12:06,592 --> 00:12:07,760
Doc, let me takeover.

84
00:12:07,827 --> 00:12:10,930
-Right?
-She's really dedicated.

85
00:12:10,996 --> 00:12:12,832
You mean "workaholic."

86
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:15,768
Come on, Doc.

87
00:12:15,835 --> 00:12:18,270
-I'll be done soon.
-It's already 1:30pm.

88
00:12:20,439 --> 00:12:21,540
How are you feeling?

89
00:12:21,607 --> 00:12:23,342
I'm doing okay, sir.

90
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:26,946
Are you alone? Where is Sir Lucas?

91
00:12:27,947 --> 00:12:31,317
He left this morning to hunt down
the remaining members of the PRG.

92
00:12:32,218 --> 00:12:34,954
Can't Lucas stay behind
and not join the hunt anymore?

93
00:12:35,888 --> 00:12:37,690
I know Lucas,

94
00:12:38,124 --> 00:12:40,226
he will see the end of this war himself.

95
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:42,394
-Am I right?
-That's right, sir.

96
00:12:43,195 --> 00:12:44,363
Doc.

97
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:46,732
Don't worry about Big Boss.

98
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:49,668
He's a badass.
He won't allow himself to be defeated.

99
00:13:02,748 --> 00:13:03,983
Come on, let's go.

100
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:41,987
I pity Bullet and Madame.

101
00:13:42,755 --> 00:13:44,790
They were about to build a family.

102
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:49,395
Madame's dream of having a child
was about to come true.

103
00:13:49,461 --> 00:13:51,497
They'll be a family in the afterlife.

104
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:56,836
Let's be glad
they were together until the end.

105
00:13:57,770 --> 00:14:00,239
They were in each other's arms.

106
00:14:00,306 --> 00:14:01,640
They never left each other.

107
00:14:01,707 --> 00:14:04,276
We also won't abandon
what they've started.

108
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:07,413
Yes, a lot of our men died…

109
00:14:08,414 --> 00:14:11,917
but it doesn't mean
we'll stop fighting for our cause.

110
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:18,991
Bullet and Janet may have died,
but not the PRG.

111
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:07,072
Let me do it.

112
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:22,888
Don't you have field operations today?

113
00:15:24,023 --> 00:15:26,825
I submitted my report and paper works
to Colonel Garcia.

114
00:15:27,693 --> 00:15:29,261
Manalo is in the field now.

115
00:15:42,341 --> 00:15:43,309
Does it still hurt?

116
00:15:44,843 --> 00:15:46,278
I can take any kind of pain.

117
00:15:47,646 --> 00:15:51,383
From a gunshot or a stab wound…

118
00:15:53,052 --> 00:15:54,353
as long as you're with me.

119
00:15:56,388 --> 00:15:58,457
Look who's the sweet talker now.

120
00:16:01,927 --> 00:16:03,195
Are you sure you're okay?

121
00:16:27,553 --> 00:16:30,322
Colonel Garcia wants to see you
in his office, sir.

122
00:16:30,622 --> 00:16:32,124
You too, Captain Defensor.

123
00:16:32,191 --> 00:16:33,292
Okay.

124
00:16:40,599 --> 00:16:41,700
I called you here

125
00:16:41,767 --> 00:16:44,470
because Brigadier General Defensor
is coming to Urdan.

126
00:16:47,706 --> 00:16:48,607
He's coming?

127
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:50,042
Order of the Chief of Staff.

128
00:16:50,109 --> 00:16:52,244
Urdan remains a red zone,

129
00:16:52,311 --> 00:16:53,645
a rebel hotspot.

130
00:17:01,653 --> 00:17:05,891
Is there a problem, Captain Defensor?
Sergeant Ramos?

131
00:17:24,009 --> 00:17:27,246
Wow, that's a good girl.

132
00:17:27,513 --> 00:17:29,815
You still have to drink
a lot of water, okay?

133
00:17:44,463 --> 00:17:45,464
Janet?

134
00:17:46,198 --> 00:17:47,099
Janet.

135
00:17:49,268 --> 00:17:50,903
Thank God you're safe.

136
00:17:51,403 --> 00:17:53,505
I thought something bad happened to you.

137
00:17:54,106 --> 00:17:55,474
What do you mean?

138
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:01,513
I'm sorry. I thought…

139
00:18:02,714 --> 00:18:04,116
Come with us.

140
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:08,020
You shouldn't be here.
You, and especially your child.

141
00:18:09,321 --> 00:18:10,756
Your pregnancy is delicate,

142
00:18:10,823 --> 00:18:13,025
and it's not safe
for you to give birth here.

143
00:18:13,892 --> 00:18:16,361
Do you want your child
to grow up in this kind of place?

144
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:18,464
I know you want to save us,

145
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:22,668
but this is your chance
to save yourself and your child.

146
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:25,704
Think about what I told you.

147
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:27,806
I can help you and the child.

148
00:18:40,819 --> 00:18:43,088
Lord, guide Janet and her child.

149
00:18:43,822 --> 00:18:45,657
Please don't let anything happen to them.

150
00:18:52,998 --> 00:18:53,866
Doc…

151
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:56,235
Are you okay?

152
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:01,573
Do you want to rest first?

153
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:04,643
Doc Ralph can take charge for now
if you want.

154
00:19:05,677 --> 00:19:06,812
She's right, Doc.

155
00:19:07,379 --> 00:19:11,416
You should rest first.
We don't have a lot of patients today.

156
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:17,556
What if something bad happened to them?

157
00:19:18,924 --> 00:19:20,559
I won't be able to take it.

158
00:19:22,394 --> 00:19:23,996
It's my fault.

159
00:19:24,229 --> 00:19:26,798
What happened to them is my fault.

160
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:29,535
Maybe they survived.

161
00:19:30,369 --> 00:19:32,938
They're from around here.

162
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:36,441
It's most likely they know their way
through the forest.

163
00:19:36,909 --> 00:19:39,244
Yes, Doc. Don't stress out anymore.

164
00:19:39,878 --> 00:19:41,680
No one wanted for that to happen.

165
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:47,753
What's important now is that you're safe.

166
00:19:51,924 --> 00:19:52,891
I hope so, too.

167
00:19:54,159 --> 00:19:56,028
I hope Janet and her child are safe.

168
00:19:56,828 --> 00:19:57,696
I hope so.

169
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,401
Let's move.

170
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:39,104
It's going to be dark soon.

171
00:20:39,171 --> 00:20:41,673
Pistol, are we going back to our camp?

172
00:20:42,641 --> 00:20:44,843
Go home to your families for now.

173
00:20:47,613 --> 00:20:49,248
I'll go back to the camp alone…

174
00:20:50,816 --> 00:20:52,584
to tend to our comrades.

175
00:20:56,154 --> 00:20:58,657
We can't fight the military right now.

176
00:20:59,191 --> 00:21:00,525
Let's lie low for a while.

177
00:21:05,464 --> 00:21:09,968
We have to make the military to believe
that they've defeated us.

178
00:21:11,303 --> 00:21:12,671
That the PRG is gone.

179
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:18,143
We'll save our strength.

180
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:21,079
We'll recruit new members.

181
00:21:22,848 --> 00:21:24,449
And when the right time comes…

182
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:27,619
we'll get our revenge.

183
00:21:27,686 --> 00:21:30,422
We will continue the PRG's fight.

184
00:21:43,568 --> 00:21:44,536
Good day.

185
00:21:46,204 --> 00:21:47,839
Have you seen them here?

186
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,241
No, I haven't.

187
00:22:00,919 --> 00:22:01,920
Good day.

188
00:22:06,124 --> 00:22:07,759
Have you seen them here?

189
00:22:11,663 --> 00:22:12,531
Yes.

190
00:22:13,198 --> 00:22:14,733
They were out there by lake.

191
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,501
Are you sure?

192
00:22:16,568 --> 00:22:18,203
Yes, I saw them earlier.

193
00:22:18,303 --> 00:22:19,771
They're probably still there.

194
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:21,940
Thank you.

195
00:22:41,326 --> 00:22:42,761
Whatever happens, Moira…

196
00:22:44,363 --> 00:22:46,231
even if your father orders me to…

197
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,602
I'll never leave your side.

198
00:22:52,404 --> 00:22:53,939
I promised you that…

199
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,508
I won't leave you.

200
00:22:57,476 --> 00:22:58,744
I will keep that promise.

201
00:23:00,011 --> 00:23:01,680
I will stand up to Daddy for you.

202
00:23:12,257 --> 00:23:13,658
When your dad gets here…

203
00:23:14,626 --> 00:23:16,027
let's be discreet.

204
00:23:16,728 --> 00:23:18,263
We managed to do it before.

205
00:23:18,864 --> 00:23:20,365
We can do it again.

206
00:23:20,432 --> 00:23:21,600
For us…

207
00:23:22,934 --> 00:23:24,169
I will do it.

208
00:24:06,244 --> 00:24:07,312
They really are PRGs.

209
00:24:34,206 --> 00:24:36,341
Please, stop!

210
00:24:36,408 --> 00:24:38,510
I will not fight back. I surrender.

211
00:24:38,577 --> 00:24:39,778
No more. I surrender.

212
00:24:41,446 --> 00:24:42,514
Big Boss.

213
00:24:44,049 --> 00:24:47,052
We captured two PRG Members, over.

214
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:49,654
Copy, bring them to the base
for interrogation.

215
00:25:29,728 --> 00:25:32,264
Biboy, get out of here! Go!

216
00:25:35,166 --> 00:25:39,237
<i>Someone told me</i>
<i>that we all have a duty to our country.</i>

217
00:25:39,437 --> 00:25:43,141
I know it's difficult it's tiring,
but we need to do it.

218
00:25:43,542 --> 00:25:46,077
<i>Like the soldiers who are here right now,</i>

219
00:25:46,144 --> 00:25:47,846
<i>it's our duty to save people.</i>

220
00:25:48,613 --> 00:25:49,814
<i>Now that I'm here,</i>

221
00:25:49,881 --> 00:25:52,117
<i>I'll make sure</i>
<i>that nothing bad happens to you.</i>

222
00:25:52,183 --> 00:25:53,685
<i>If we move the rock,</i>

223
00:25:53,752 --> 00:25:55,787
<i>the metal frame</i>
<i>that's puncturing Norman will move.</i>

224
00:25:55,854 --> 00:25:59,624
<i>And if we move the metal frame,</i>
<i>the boulder will fall on Lito.</i>

225
00:25:59,691 --> 00:26:01,326
Either way, one of them will die.

226
00:26:01,393 --> 00:26:02,827
I thought you went back to Manila.

227
00:26:02,894 --> 00:26:05,864
<i>It's our duty</i>
<i>to protect the people here in Urdan.</i>

228
00:26:05,931 --> 00:26:08,233
<i>And I had to go back for someone</i>

229
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:10,335
<i>because I can't leave her here.</i>
