1
00:00:11,311 --> 00:00:13,780
Doc, why don't we tell Captain Lucas?

2
00:00:14,447 --> 00:00:18,685
-We need to stop your brother.
-You saw what he did earlier.

3
00:00:18,752 --> 00:00:20,453
I don't want him to hurt himself.

4
00:00:21,388 --> 00:00:23,523
We can't tell Lucas about this.

5
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:24,591
What won't you tell me?

6
00:00:24,657 --> 00:00:26,526
That Captain Moira is missing.

7
00:00:26,593 --> 00:00:30,096
I had a decision to make and I chose you.

8
00:00:30,163 --> 00:00:32,198
But I didn't want to hurt anybody.

9
00:00:35,835 --> 00:00:37,370
<i>I've hurt you even more.</i>

10
00:00:37,437 --> 00:00:40,440
Are you sure the supplier
we will meet is good?

11
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:46,413
It's okay. Just let them go.

12
00:00:46,846 --> 00:00:50,617
The important thing is I have PRG back
and no one can take it away from me.

13
00:00:50,683 --> 00:00:52,685
I will finish what I started.

14
00:00:52,752 --> 00:00:53,920
Tonight…

15
00:00:58,725 --> 00:00:59,993
We will crush them.

16
00:01:00,527 --> 00:01:02,929
Captain Manalo and the Alpha Team
just returned

17
00:01:02,996 --> 00:01:04,764
from an operation against the PRG.

18
00:01:04,831 --> 00:01:08,034
Technical Sergeant Ramos
has gunshot wound on his chest.

19
00:01:08,101 --> 00:01:09,769
He needs an operation right now.

20
00:01:09,836 --> 00:01:12,939
My brother is wounded.
He just called me. I need to see him.

21
00:01:13,006 --> 00:01:15,475
No, Doc, you can't leave.
I will not allow you.

22
00:01:15,542 --> 00:01:18,845
Hazel, I have no choice, okay?
I need to treat him.

23
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:20,680
What if Captain Lucas finds out
about this?

24
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:23,049
I'm sure it will cause trouble.

25
00:01:23,116 --> 00:01:24,818
I'm sorry if I got mad at you.

26
00:01:24,884 --> 00:01:27,520
I know you never wanted
to hurt Diego's mom.

27
00:01:27,587 --> 00:01:29,722
I'm the one
who should apologize to you, my child.

28
00:01:31,291 --> 00:01:33,193
I hope you can forgive me.

29
00:01:46,406 --> 00:01:48,908
Good thing your wounds
were treated right away.

30
00:01:48,975 --> 00:01:51,311
You could have lost a lot of blood.

31
00:01:53,446 --> 00:01:55,315
I thought you're not coming.

32
00:01:56,516 --> 00:01:58,051
You know I can't do that.

33
00:01:58,718 --> 00:02:02,922
I told you I won't abandon you.

34
00:02:02,989 --> 00:02:05,058
Are you sure
the soldiers didn't follow you?

35
00:02:06,092 --> 00:02:08,528
-Maybe you are wired.
-Of course not.

36
00:02:08,595 --> 00:02:10,830
I'm not like you, Rodel.

37
00:02:11,998 --> 00:02:14,734
I can't put other people in danger.

38
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:19,706
I know you don't want me
to take revenge on those soldiers.

39
00:02:21,508 --> 00:02:25,979
But as long as I live, I'll make them pay
for what they did to Janet and my child.

40
00:02:26,546 --> 00:02:28,948
Brother, until when will you be like that?

41
00:02:29,749 --> 00:02:32,318
I know you're angry. I understand you.

42
00:02:33,019 --> 00:02:35,021
I know it hurts to lose a love one.

43
00:02:35,088 --> 00:02:39,826
But can any of your actions bring back
the lives of your wife and child?

44
00:02:39,893 --> 00:02:40,727
No.

45
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:43,997
But it will lessen my anger.

46
00:02:44,063 --> 00:02:46,566
Until when will your anger last?

47
00:02:47,867 --> 00:02:49,869
Maxine, you won't understand.

48
00:02:52,939 --> 00:02:54,874
PRG still has a lot of plans.

49
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:57,977
We still have a lot of things to do.

50
00:03:00,413 --> 00:03:01,381
What?

51
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:06,419
You will understand if you join us.

52
00:03:08,087 --> 00:03:11,024
Brother, you know I can't do that.

53
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:14,994
Let's talk about it later.

54
00:03:31,311 --> 00:03:35,815
I've been calling Doc Maxine,
but I can't seem to contact her.

55
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:37,250
I can't find her.

56
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:39,852
Have you seen her?

57
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,423
Why don't we tell Captain Lucas?

58
00:03:43,489 --> 00:03:47,660
We need to stop your brother.
You saw what he did earlier.

59
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:49,762
I don't want him to hurt himself.

60
00:03:50,263 --> 00:03:52,198
Lucas can't find out about this.

61
00:03:52,265 --> 00:03:54,701
What if innocent people get involved?

62
00:03:54,767 --> 00:03:56,736
Hazel, please give me time.

63
00:03:56,803 --> 00:03:58,304
I will fix it, promise.

64
00:03:59,105 --> 00:04:01,574
I don't know. I'm sorry.

65
00:04:06,813 --> 00:04:07,847
Are you okay?

66
00:04:08,314 --> 00:04:09,782
I'm sorry.

67
00:04:10,483 --> 00:04:12,518
I'm not good at lying.

68
00:04:12,952 --> 00:04:15,154
I was not raised by my parents to lie.

69
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:19,726
Okay, what's the problem?

70
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:25,798
Captain Lucas, there's something
I need to tell you.

71
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,234
What is it?

72
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:32,372
Doc Maxine left.

73
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:34,274
She left?

74
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:37,877
Where did she go?

75
00:04:38,544 --> 00:04:40,480
She went to…

76
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:42,048
Where?

77
00:04:43,916 --> 00:04:45,885
Where did Maxine go?

78
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:47,754
She went to the PRG camp.

79
00:04:50,857 --> 00:04:51,758
What?

80
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:38,604
Okay, you take care.

81
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:40,740
I'll go ahead.

82
00:05:57,523 --> 00:05:58,791
Where are you going, Doc?

83
00:06:00,126 --> 00:06:02,228
I will go back to the military camp.

84
00:06:02,295 --> 00:06:03,363
You can't leave.

85
00:06:04,464 --> 00:06:06,632
Don't worry.
You don't have to accompany me.

86
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:10,837
I want to head back before it gets dark.

87
00:06:10,903 --> 00:06:13,840
I'm sorry, Doc.
It's your brother's order.

88
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:16,442
What?

89
00:06:16,909 --> 00:06:18,211
Just stay here, Maxine.

90
00:06:21,447 --> 00:06:23,149
What is she doing there?

91
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:24,584
I'm sorry.

92
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:27,387
-I promised Doc Maxine that I won't…
-Why did she go there?

93
00:06:28,855 --> 00:06:30,423
Did you just find out?

94
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:33,693
You know that you are not allowed
to get out of here.

95
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,495
That's the protocol. It's dangerous.

96
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:39,532
No one should get out of the camp
without a military escort.

97
00:06:39,599 --> 00:06:42,268
-Unbelievable.
-She insisted.

98
00:06:42,335 --> 00:06:44,036
Doc Beauty, come in.

99
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:47,173
What is the meaning of this?

100
00:06:48,775 --> 00:06:51,477
I'm leaving. People are waiting for me.

101
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:54,280
They might be worried about me.

102
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:56,382
Don't let her go.

103
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:23,643
Are you serious, Rodel?

104
00:07:25,244 --> 00:07:27,947
You can't hold me hostage.
I'm your sister.

105
00:07:28,014 --> 00:07:29,182
That's the thing!

106
00:07:30,316 --> 00:07:33,786
I'm your older brother,
but you listen more to those soldiers.

107
00:07:33,853 --> 00:07:37,156
So whether you like it or not,
you're now a member of PRG.

108
00:07:37,223 --> 00:07:39,325
You can longer go back to your camp.

109
00:07:39,392 --> 00:07:45,531
Brother, I did what you want.
I did my job. So, just let me go.

110
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:49,435
What do you want from me?

111
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:52,939
You can be a valuable asset to the group.

112
00:07:53,005 --> 00:07:54,841
We need a doctor in our camp.

113
00:07:54,907 --> 00:07:56,642
That's not possible.

114
00:07:56,709 --> 00:07:58,544
I can't do what you want, Rodel.

115
00:08:02,548 --> 00:08:03,683
I'm leaving.

116
00:08:03,749 --> 00:08:04,917
Don't let her go.

117
00:08:06,786 --> 00:08:08,488
Tie her up so she won't escape.

118
00:08:08,554 --> 00:08:11,657
Have you gone mad, Rodel?
Are you out of your mind?

119
00:08:11,724 --> 00:08:14,393
I'm your sister! You can't do this to me.

120
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:17,597
I'm sorry, my sister.

121
00:08:22,535 --> 00:08:23,569
Do it.

122
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:27,707
Rodel, please!

123
00:08:29,141 --> 00:08:31,444
You can't do this to me, Rodel!

124
00:08:32,011 --> 00:08:33,079
Brother!

125
00:08:42,955 --> 00:08:46,692
Once you see my face,
it means you can't get out of here alive.

126
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:51,330
They are doctors. They are not enemies.

127
00:08:51,397 --> 00:08:52,899
-Let's go.
-Let them go.

128
00:08:52,965 --> 00:08:55,034
I need a human shield. Give her to me.

129
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:59,739
You fell into my trap, Captain Manalo.

130
00:09:01,007 --> 00:09:02,208
You can't leave.

131
00:09:02,275 --> 00:09:03,576
It's your brother's order.

132
00:09:30,469 --> 00:09:33,072
I'm sorry I got you involved in this.

133
00:09:33,706 --> 00:09:35,541
Don't worry about that, Big Boss.

134
00:09:36,475 --> 00:09:38,578
We owe Doc Maxine a lot.

135
00:10:29,395 --> 00:10:31,697
You think Lucas can still save you.

136
00:10:31,764 --> 00:10:34,300
As long as I'm alive,
he can't get you from me.

137
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:35,368
Do you understand?

138
00:10:42,241 --> 00:10:43,643
I can't reach her.

139
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:18,611
<i>Answer me.</i>

140
00:11:20,046 --> 00:11:22,181
Here. Bullet sent you some food.

141
00:11:28,054 --> 00:11:29,321
I'll leave it here.

142
00:11:33,726 --> 00:11:35,828
Until when will you keep me here?

143
00:11:37,063 --> 00:11:38,564
That will depend on Bullet.

144
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,202
I'll just come back later.

145
00:11:44,937 --> 00:11:46,772
Let me out of here!

146
00:11:47,306 --> 00:11:49,008
Let me go!

147
00:14:27,967 --> 00:14:29,101
<i>Answer me.</i>

148
00:14:29,168 --> 00:14:30,569
Won't you answer him?

149
00:14:33,973 --> 00:14:37,343
Later. We need to focus.

150
00:15:50,816 --> 00:15:51,817
Come here.

151
00:15:54,186 --> 00:15:56,622
Ouch, let me go.

152
00:16:02,194 --> 00:16:04,029
Ouch, let me go.

153
00:16:08,767 --> 00:16:10,436
-Ouch, let me go!
-You really won't quit!

154
00:16:10,502 --> 00:16:12,237
Let her go.

155
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:22,014
Put your guns down
or the doctor gets hurt.

156
00:16:26,218 --> 00:16:27,619
Put your guns down!

157
00:16:33,025 --> 00:16:34,460
Put your guns down!

158
00:16:36,895 --> 00:16:37,997
I will kill her.

159
00:16:56,281 --> 00:16:57,149
Put your hands up.

160
00:16:59,651 --> 00:17:00,953
Maxine, run!

161
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:16,201
Big Boss, I got this.

162
00:17:36,655 --> 00:17:39,591
Maxine, don't move.

163
00:17:42,828 --> 00:17:43,962
Why?

164
00:17:44,029 --> 00:17:45,998
There are land mines scattered around.

165
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:50,436
Maxine, don't move.
You stepped on a land mine.

166
00:17:50,502 --> 00:17:53,138
What will I do?
I don't want to die, Lucas.

167
00:17:53,205 --> 00:17:56,708
-Stay here!
-Okay, don't move your feet.

168
00:17:56,775 --> 00:17:58,644
I will step on it instead.

169
00:18:11,957 --> 00:18:13,258
Hey! You're really crazy!

170
00:18:15,294 --> 00:18:17,396
You are really a cheater.

171
00:18:17,463 --> 00:18:21,433
Hey, this is not the right time
to joke around, Lucas.

172
00:18:22,167 --> 00:18:23,969
You have done this to me before.

173
00:18:24,036 --> 00:18:25,237
I'm not joking.

174
00:18:35,481 --> 00:18:36,648
This is not a joke?

175
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:38,417
No.

176
00:18:45,324 --> 00:18:48,894
Maxine, just one wrong move
and it will explode.

177
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:51,430
Believe me, okay?

178
00:18:52,164 --> 00:18:53,765
-What now?
-Don't move.

179
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:55,868
Don't move.

180
00:19:00,038 --> 00:19:03,041
-How do we get out of here?
-I will take care of it.

181
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:06,445
Just trust me.

182
00:19:07,913 --> 00:19:08,847
Just hold me.

183
00:19:14,586 --> 00:19:16,088
Just calm down. I got you.

184
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:09,868
You're safe now.

185
00:21:13,639 --> 00:21:14,706
It's okay.

186
00:21:15,907 --> 00:21:16,775
It's okay?

187
00:21:17,242 --> 00:21:18,644
Are you okay?

188
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:19,678
You're okay.

189
00:21:27,352 --> 00:21:29,421
Let's go.

190
00:21:33,659 --> 00:21:35,761
Why did you disobey my order?

191
00:21:35,827 --> 00:21:38,096
Do you know the repercussions
of what you did?

192
00:21:38,897 --> 00:21:41,700
Snoopy is not at fault, sir.
I'm the one who gave him the order.

193
00:21:41,767 --> 00:21:44,369
But if we didn't take action,

194
00:21:44,436 --> 00:21:46,605
something bad might have happened
to Maxine.

195
00:21:47,506 --> 00:21:50,108
I won't allow innocent people
to get involved.

196
00:21:50,175 --> 00:21:52,210
You should use your brain.

197
00:21:52,277 --> 00:21:54,646
You disrespected my authority.

198
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:02,020
I will accept whatever the consequences
of my actions are.

199
00:22:02,087 --> 00:22:03,055
You should.

200
00:22:29,281 --> 00:22:31,650
I will let this pass.

201
00:22:31,717 --> 00:22:35,921
But next time,
I will not go easy on the both of you.

202
00:22:36,688 --> 00:22:38,390
Do we understand each other?

203
00:22:41,126 --> 00:22:44,162
I'm sorry. You got involved because of me.

204
00:22:44,963 --> 00:22:47,399
Big Boss, come on. We are a team.

205
00:22:48,333 --> 00:22:49,534
That's right.

206
00:22:49,601 --> 00:22:51,670
Good thing we were not disciplined.

207
00:22:53,672 --> 00:22:59,044
With all your mischiefs, Big Boss,
it's a wonder you're still here in Urdan.

208
00:22:59,578 --> 00:23:02,581
Don't get smart with me.
Are you feeling better now?

209
00:23:02,647 --> 00:23:03,682
Yes of course, Big Boss.

210
00:23:03,749 --> 00:23:07,953
Our medical team takes good care of us,
especially Doc Maxine.

211
00:23:12,591 --> 00:23:15,527
This place is really dangerous
for Doc Maxine.

212
00:23:15,594 --> 00:23:17,596
I'm worried about her.

213
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:23,101
But it seems danger
always find its way to her.

214
00:23:23,635 --> 00:23:24,770
That's the thing, Big Boss.

215
00:23:24,836 --> 00:23:28,874
Have you asked her
how she got into the PRG camp?

216
00:23:31,276 --> 00:23:35,614
I asked her earlier,
but she doesn't want to talk.

217
00:23:36,982 --> 00:23:38,550
Could she be hiding something?

218
00:23:45,390 --> 00:23:47,726
It looks like you're in a hurry.
Where are you going?

219
00:23:49,327 --> 00:23:53,265
I'm going to Sitio Santos
to see Miss Sheila.

220
00:23:53,331 --> 00:23:55,400
I will bring some medicine.

221
00:23:56,034 --> 00:23:57,269
Do you want me to come with you?

222
00:23:57,335 --> 00:24:00,639
I'll just ask Nurse Hazel.

223
00:24:00,705 --> 00:24:02,207
I just remembered.
There's something I have to do.

224
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,282
Is that blood? Where did you get it?

225
00:24:13,084 --> 00:24:14,085
Where have you been?

226
00:24:14,152 --> 00:24:18,423
I came from the other Sitio.

227
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:20,192
Don't tell Lucas, okay?

228
00:24:23,328 --> 00:24:25,130
What is it that you won't tell me?

229
00:24:27,866 --> 00:24:29,868
She went to…

230
00:24:30,836 --> 00:24:31,937
Where?

231
00:24:33,171 --> 00:24:35,173
Where did Maxine go?

232
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:37,542
She went to the PRG camp.

233
00:25:09,674 --> 00:25:14,012
Doc Maxine, we can't do things
without you.

234
00:25:14,079 --> 00:25:16,882
If not for you,
the medical team will not be complete.

235
00:25:16,948 --> 00:25:19,217
-You are our source of strength.
-That's true.

236
00:25:20,485 --> 00:25:23,588
Whatever happens, you're still our leader.

237
00:25:23,655 --> 00:25:28,793
If only my brother did not become a rebel,
things wouldn't be this complicated.

238
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:33,498
Why don't you just tell Captain Lucas
about your brother?

239
00:25:35,133 --> 00:25:37,669
How did you gain access to the PRG camp?

240
00:25:37,736 --> 00:25:39,804
-Do you have a contact inside?
-What?

241
00:25:39,871 --> 00:25:43,808
It is impossible for you to go there
on your own without a contact inside.

242
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:45,844
I will repeat my question.

243
00:25:45,911 --> 00:25:47,779
Do you have a contact inside the PRG?

244
00:25:47,846 --> 00:25:50,048
<i>Why won't you speak?</i>

245
00:25:50,582 --> 00:25:52,284
Is there something holding you back?
