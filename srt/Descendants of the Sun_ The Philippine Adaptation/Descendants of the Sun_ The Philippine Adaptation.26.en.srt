1
00:00:11,244 --> 00:00:13,780
-How are you?
-I'm doing okay, sir.

2
00:00:13,847 --> 00:00:15,782
Are you alone? Where is Sir Lucas?

3
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:19,119
He left this morning to hunt down
the remaining members of PRG.

4
00:00:19,185 --> 00:00:21,621
Can't Lucas stay behind and
not join the hunt anymore?

5
00:00:21,688 --> 00:00:24,724
Knowing Lucas,
he will see the end of this war himself.

6
00:00:25,658 --> 00:00:28,728
<i>I called you because</i>
<i>Brigadier General Defensor is coming.</i>

7
00:00:28,795 --> 00:00:30,397
It's the order of the Chief of Staff.

8
00:00:36,736 --> 00:00:39,205
What if something bad happened to them?

9
00:00:39,272 --> 00:00:40,907
<i>I won't be able to take it.</i>

10
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:43,877
It's my fault why it happened to them.

11
00:00:43,943 --> 00:00:46,012
<i>Bullet and Janet may have died,</i>

12
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:49,315
but it doesn't mean we'll stop fighting
for our cause.

13
00:00:49,449 --> 00:00:51,818
We'll recruit new members.

14
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:55,188
When the right time comes,
we'll get our revenge.

15
00:00:55,255 --> 00:00:58,291
<i>Even if your father orders me to,</i>
<i>I'll never leave your side.</i>

16
00:00:58,358 --> 00:01:00,360
I will stand up for you against my father.

17
00:01:00,427 --> 00:01:01,594
Let's keep things discreet.

18
00:01:01,661 --> 00:01:04,964
<i>We were able to do it before.</i>
<i>We can do it again.</i>

19
00:01:05,031 --> 00:01:08,501
Have you seen them here?
Yes. They were out there by the lake.

20
00:01:08,568 --> 00:01:10,036
Confirmed, they are the PRGs.

21
00:02:09,496 --> 00:02:10,730
Glad you made it.

22
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:12,165
Where is Capt. Defensor?

23
00:02:14,667 --> 00:02:16,002
It's my dad.

24
00:02:35,855 --> 00:02:37,357
The flight was on time.

25
00:02:52,372 --> 00:02:53,373
Good Afternoon, sir.

26
00:03:01,648 --> 00:03:04,117
Sir, we prepared snacks in the office.

27
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:07,587
I'm sure you're tired from your flight,
so you can stay there first.

28
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:18,765
Okay.

29
00:03:58,304 --> 00:04:01,274
I won't fight. I surrender!

30
00:04:01,341 --> 00:04:02,475
I surrender.

31
00:04:03,876 --> 00:04:08,181
Big boss, we caught
two members of PRG, over.

32
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:10,650
Copy. Bring them back to base
for interrogation.

33
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:17,583
Your attempt
to rescue the kidnapped doctors

34
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:20,753
and curtail PRG activities in Urdan
was successful.

35
00:05:28,428 --> 00:05:32,432
But as your father, I'm worried about you.

36
00:05:34,567 --> 00:05:40,173
This is a dangerous place and anytime,
things could get out of hand.

37
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:51,150
That is why I'm here in Urdan, dad,

38
00:05:51,584 --> 00:05:53,553
because I'm qualified for this mission.

39
00:06:00,793 --> 00:06:05,465
I'm here to do my job and my mission
for our country.

40
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:07,600
So stop worrying, dad. Okay?

41
00:06:09,936 --> 00:06:12,138
I can't stop myself from being a father.

42
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:15,208
And this is your first time in the field.

43
00:06:15,274 --> 00:06:18,044
It's okay, Dad.
I am capable of protecting myself.

44
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:32,125
What's that?

45
00:06:39,165 --> 00:06:39,999
Show it to me.

46
00:06:42,301 --> 00:06:43,503
Moira!

47
00:06:56,983 --> 00:06:58,151
Where did you get that?

48
00:06:58,217 --> 00:07:01,120
You said you're okay and unharmed.

49
00:07:05,191 --> 00:07:06,793
Where are your comrades hiding?

50
00:07:08,828 --> 00:07:11,330
Your camp. Where's your camp?

51
00:07:17,236 --> 00:07:20,940
You know soldiers like us...

52
00:07:21,641 --> 00:07:23,309
Well, they're also soldiers.

53
00:07:24,177 --> 00:07:25,978
We are not enemies.

54
00:07:26,045 --> 00:07:28,481
We only want one thing,

55
00:07:28,548 --> 00:07:33,886
peace and order for our country.

56
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,955
Lies!

57
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:45,965
I know a gunshot wound.

58
00:07:46,499 --> 00:07:48,067
During the rescue ops, dad.

59
00:07:52,538 --> 00:07:53,539
Who?

60
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:59,045
Technical Sergeant Diego Ramos.

61
00:07:59,111 --> 00:08:01,214
That guy is really putting you in trouble.

62
00:08:02,048 --> 00:08:03,816
I warned him to stay away from you!

63
00:08:04,584 --> 00:08:06,118
Dad, it was not his fault.

64
00:08:06,185 --> 00:08:09,522
He was in danger and if I didn't save him,
he might be dead by now.

65
00:08:09,589 --> 00:08:12,592
This wouldn't happen if
you didn't come here.

66
00:08:24,103 --> 00:08:26,606
Dad, you don't understand that
this is my choice.

67
00:08:28,307 --> 00:08:29,809
It's my choice to come here.

68
00:08:29,876 --> 00:08:34,180
I'm no longer a cadet you can dictate
or order around.

69
00:08:41,254 --> 00:08:44,724
And as my subordinate,
you will follow my orders.

70
00:08:47,793 --> 00:08:48,794
Leave this place.

71
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:52,498
Is there something I don't know, Moira?

72
00:08:53,633 --> 00:08:55,735
Are you and Diego hiding something?

73
00:08:58,271 --> 00:08:59,171
Sir, nothing, sir.

74
00:08:59,238 --> 00:09:00,573
I know you, Moira.

75
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,742
You're stubborn.

76
00:09:03,242 --> 00:09:04,911
We are the same.

77
00:09:04,977 --> 00:09:06,646
You are my daughter after all.

78
00:09:08,514 --> 00:09:10,650
But your foolishness about Diego must end.

79
00:09:37,677 --> 00:09:39,011
Do you need anything, sir?

80
00:09:41,781 --> 00:09:45,318
I told you to stay away from my daughter.

81
00:09:46,819 --> 00:09:48,754
But you managed to put her in trouble.

82
00:09:51,724 --> 00:09:53,159
Didn't you think about that?

83
00:09:53,225 --> 00:09:56,662
Sir, I didn't want that to happen.

84
00:09:57,863 --> 00:10:00,166
But what happened was
in the line of duty, sir.

85
00:10:02,768 --> 00:10:04,537
Maybe you've forgotten my rank.

86
00:10:07,807 --> 00:10:11,143
Now, are you in a relationship
with my daughter?

87
00:10:12,912 --> 00:10:16,916
Let's keep things discreet once your
dad gets here.

88
00:10:16,983 --> 00:10:21,654
We were able to do it before, right?
We can do it again.

89
00:10:21,721 --> 00:10:25,658
For us, I'll do it.

90
00:10:26,859 --> 00:10:27,760
No, sir.

91
00:10:45,745 --> 00:10:47,213
Brother...

92
00:10:52,051 --> 00:10:56,522
if you won't cooperate with us,
you'll suffer more serious punishment.

93
00:11:09,902 --> 00:11:11,871
What were you doing there earlier?

94
00:11:11,937 --> 00:11:13,205
We were there...

95
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:17,910
to pay our final respects to
Bullet and Ma'am Janet.

96
00:11:18,744 --> 00:11:20,179
Say that again.

97
00:11:21,113 --> 00:11:25,151
We were there to pay our final respects
to Bullet and Ma'am Janet.

98
00:11:25,217 --> 00:11:26,619
Where are they?

99
00:11:29,789 --> 00:11:30,956
Where are they?

100
00:11:34,126 --> 00:11:35,227
They're already dead.

101
00:11:47,273 --> 00:11:48,908
Make sure that you are telling the truth.

102
00:11:48,974 --> 00:11:51,510
Or are you just saying that so we will
stop looking for them?

103
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:53,212
What? Are they dead or alive?

104
00:11:54,146 --> 00:11:56,716
-Tell us the truth!
-It's true. That's the truth!

105
00:11:57,416 --> 00:11:59,919
We found their lifeless bodies
in the jungle,

106
00:12:00,453 --> 00:12:01,387
completely burned.

107
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:05,324
We suspect that they committed suicide.

108
00:12:10,096 --> 00:12:11,797
Boss, that's what we saw earlier.

109
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:28,914
I surrender. I won't fight.

110
00:12:31,951 --> 00:12:33,319
Where did you bury them?

111
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,589
Where did you bury them?

112
00:12:36,655 --> 00:12:39,325
It's near where you found us.

113
00:12:39,391 --> 00:12:41,260
I can take you there.

114
00:12:41,327 --> 00:12:42,561
Have pity on me.

115
00:12:42,628 --> 00:12:44,296
I don't want to go to jail.

116
00:12:45,231 --> 00:12:47,032
I'll leave them with you.

117
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:49,168
I'll just confirm
if what they said is true.

118
00:12:49,835 --> 00:12:50,703
Yes, sir.

119
00:12:57,910 --> 00:13:00,112
It looks like
we're running out of alcohol.

120
00:13:01,514 --> 00:13:03,783
I think we need to restock.

121
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:06,218
Lucas!

122
00:13:06,986 --> 00:13:08,354
Lucas, wait.

123
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:10,890
-Lucas!
-Later, Maxine.

124
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:12,491
We need to go somewhere. Let's go.

125
00:13:12,558 --> 00:13:15,027
I just want to know
if you have updates about Janet.

126
00:13:15,094 --> 00:13:17,029
Did you find her? What happened to her?

127
00:13:17,096 --> 00:13:19,565
I'm just worried about her and her baby.

128
00:13:19,832 --> 00:13:21,600
We're on our way to the river area.

129
00:13:22,201 --> 00:13:26,872
We have information
that there are PRG members buried there.

130
00:13:28,607 --> 00:13:31,510
It's their leader and a pregnant woman.

131
00:13:36,182 --> 00:13:37,783
-Can I come, please?
-No, Maxine.

132
00:13:39,251 --> 00:13:40,419
You can't.

133
00:13:42,121 --> 00:13:43,856
I hope Janet is still alive.

134
00:13:56,435 --> 00:13:57,870
What if it's true?

135
00:13:58,437 --> 00:14:00,439
What if it's Janet who is buried there?

136
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:03,342
It's like I killed them.

137
00:14:03,642 --> 00:14:06,579
Doc, just calm down.
We haven't confirmed that yet.

138
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:08,214
Maybe it's fake news.

139
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:10,015
What if it's true?

140
00:14:12,051 --> 00:14:15,921
Stop thinking that you killed them.

141
00:14:16,288 --> 00:14:19,024
You did what you had to do because
you want to help.

142
00:14:19,091 --> 00:14:23,362
In med school, we were taught that losing
a patient is part of being a doctor.

143
00:14:24,063 --> 00:14:27,433
What's important is
you did everything to save them.

144
00:14:30,436 --> 00:14:33,072
Dr. Maxine, you're a good doctor.

145
00:14:33,239 --> 00:14:36,542
And that won't change
no matter what happens.

146
00:15:38,304 --> 00:15:40,139
-Harry Potter.
-Sir.

147
00:15:40,706 --> 00:15:42,207
Take a picture of the pit.

148
00:15:44,076 --> 00:15:45,044
Piccolo,

149
00:15:46,178 --> 00:15:47,913
get hair samples for the ID.

150
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:02,394
<i>No one will suspect me here.</i>

151
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:04,396
<i>I won't get caught here.</i>

152
00:16:15,841 --> 00:16:18,377
The pregnant lady
they're calling "Madame"...

153
00:16:18,444 --> 00:16:20,412
What were you doing there earlier?

154
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:24,683
We were there to pay our final respects
to Bullet and Madame.

155
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:26,919
You might die.

156
00:16:27,186 --> 00:16:28,587
Let's surrender.

157
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:31,090
I will not surrender
especially to soldiers.

158
00:16:33,292 --> 00:16:34,593
Hands up.

159
00:16:35,294 --> 00:16:36,895
...is Janet.

160
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,568
The leader of PRG is dead.

161
00:16:43,135 --> 00:16:45,537
Finally, we can go back to Manila.

162
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:47,906
This shouldn't happen.

163
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:54,747
No one should die just because
they fight for what they believe in.

164
00:16:58,384 --> 00:17:00,886
No one should suffer because of violence.

165
00:17:03,722 --> 00:17:05,524
Even an innocent baby got involved.

166
00:17:08,727 --> 00:17:11,230
He did not even have a chance to live.

167
00:17:29,181 --> 00:17:30,282
Hello, Dad.

168
00:17:30,349 --> 00:17:32,785
Hello, son. How are you there?

169
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:39,525
The leader of the PRG is gone.

170
00:17:39,925 --> 00:17:40,759
He's dead.

171
00:17:52,638 --> 00:17:54,139
Thank you, Dad.

172
00:17:54,206 --> 00:17:58,210
Son, can I ask a favor?

173
00:17:58,277 --> 00:18:03,582
Please take a picture
so I can see his dead body.

174
00:18:03,649 --> 00:18:07,786
Father, I personally saw his charred body.

175
00:18:08,554 --> 00:18:09,621
He's gone.

176
00:18:09,688 --> 00:18:14,226
Finally, son. I can now sleep well.

177
00:18:14,993 --> 00:18:17,663
The man who made me suffer
is finally gone.

178
00:18:19,998 --> 00:18:22,835
Son, I'm so proud of you.

179
00:18:24,203 --> 00:18:25,404
Thank you, Dad.

180
00:18:55,434 --> 00:18:56,535
Big Boss.

181
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:02,741
Any news? Did you find the burial grounds?

182
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:04,576
Confirmed.

183
00:19:06,178 --> 00:19:08,046
It's Bullet and Madame Janet.

184
00:19:08,113 --> 00:19:11,783
Finally, we succeeded.

185
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:22,294
Lucas, any news?

186
00:19:24,796 --> 00:19:25,998
Was it Janet?

187
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:37,543
It was Janet.

188
00:19:56,795 --> 00:19:58,130
Captain Lucas.

189
00:19:58,564 --> 00:19:59,731
Sir.

190
00:20:00,399 --> 00:20:02,901
Good job. I'm sure
the Chief of Staff will be happy

191
00:20:03,001 --> 00:20:06,038
with the achievement
of the Special Forces here in Urdan.

192
00:20:09,675 --> 00:20:11,510
Thank you, sir. I just did my job.

193
00:20:13,111 --> 00:20:15,247
And to you too, Sergeant Ramos

194
00:20:18,317 --> 00:20:21,153
But that doesn't mean you're off the hook.

195
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:24,756
You put the national security in danger
with what you did with Alif.

196
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:29,061
Good thing Alif survived
or else it could've started a war.

197
00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:36,168
-I thought it's already a closed case.
-Not yet.

198
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:39,204
You've had a reputation of being stubborn
even when you were still a cadet

199
00:20:39,271 --> 00:20:40,839
and as to why it ended like this.

200
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:45,077
Because of that, you need to face
the repercussions of your actions.

201
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:50,249
You can join General Defensor on his way
back to Manila at zero dark thirty.

202
00:20:50,315 --> 00:20:51,950
We're leaving this midnight?

203
00:20:52,384 --> 00:20:56,088
Yes, and you too, Ramos.
You can go with them.

204
00:20:56,388 --> 00:21:00,325
You are immediately relieved
of your services here in Urdan.

205
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:04,096
You will be given a new mission assignment
when you get to Manila.

206
00:21:22,848 --> 00:21:23,849
You're leaving?

207
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:25,751
Where are you going?

208
00:21:29,087 --> 00:21:31,189
I'm going back to Manila at midnight.

209
00:21:31,857 --> 00:21:34,226
I have to wait for my next mission
assignment there.

210
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:35,160
What?

211
00:21:35,994 --> 00:21:37,829
The conflict here is not yet over.

212
00:21:38,997 --> 00:21:42,567
I cannot stay any longer
even if I want to.

213
00:21:44,336 --> 00:21:46,138
It's the CO himself who gave the orders.

214
00:21:46,905 --> 00:21:49,207
This is dad's way of separating us.

215
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:52,110
He can't do this to us.

216
00:22:01,753 --> 00:22:04,790
Dad. Was it you ordered Diego
to go back to Manila?

217
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:12,297
It was you who said that Diego
is a good soldier.

218
00:22:26,278 --> 00:22:28,547
Are you afraid
you won't see each other again?

219
00:23:19,631 --> 00:23:23,335
How I wish I didn't allow you
to leave and go home.

220
00:23:27,572 --> 00:23:30,142
I could've taken good care of you
here in Medicube.

221
00:23:32,043 --> 00:23:35,180
If only I can bring you
and your baby back to life, I would.

222
00:23:37,649 --> 00:23:40,285
I'll do everything. Anything.

223
00:23:42,554 --> 00:23:44,790
Forgive me, Janet.

224
00:23:50,729 --> 00:23:52,497
I hope you'll forgive me.

225
00:24:08,647 --> 00:24:11,750
Nurse Emma, where is Dr. Maxine?

226
00:24:11,817 --> 00:24:16,021
I need to talk to her
before I go back to Manila.

227
00:24:17,956 --> 00:24:18,924
I don't know.

228
00:24:19,558 --> 00:24:21,660
Wait, you are you going back to Manila?

229
00:24:32,037 --> 00:24:34,072
Doc! Dr. Maxine!

230
00:24:34,439 --> 00:24:35,607
Where have you been?

231
00:24:36,041 --> 00:24:38,043
Captain Lucas has been looking for you.

232
00:24:38,109 --> 00:24:40,212
What? Why?

233
00:24:40,278 --> 00:24:42,347
They are leaving Urdan tonight.

234
00:24:42,581 --> 00:24:44,015
Go, see him. Hurry.

235
00:24:49,621 --> 00:24:50,822
Lucas...

236
00:24:52,357 --> 00:24:53,325
are you leaving?

237
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:55,894
Are you leaving tonight?

238
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:00,131
Are you still coming back?

239
00:25:00,198 --> 00:25:03,368
Our headquarters in Manila called for me.

240
00:25:04,703 --> 00:25:06,505
I don't know when I will be back...

241
00:25:09,207 --> 00:25:10,575
or if I will still be back.

242
00:25:13,612 --> 00:25:15,914
Is it because of what happened
here in Urdan?

243
00:25:23,889 --> 00:25:25,390
You want me to help you?

244
00:25:27,492 --> 00:25:29,761
I will talk to your superiors.

245
00:25:31,963 --> 00:25:34,833
I'll tell them it was my fault
and it was my decision to operate on Alif.

246
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:42,173
I'll tell them it was because of me,
it was my fault why I was kidnapped.

247
00:25:42,941 --> 00:25:45,810
That you saved us, you saved me.

248
00:25:48,046 --> 00:25:50,782
Maxine, I am responsible for all of you
here in Urdan.

249
00:25:53,084 --> 00:25:54,452
That is my duty.

250
00:25:56,755 --> 00:25:58,290
That is why I am responsible.

251
00:25:59,491 --> 00:26:01,192
Lucas, tell me what I should do.

252
00:26:01,259 --> 00:26:02,961
-I will help you.
-I can handle myself.

253
00:26:06,631 --> 00:26:08,033
It's all my fault.

254
00:26:09,134 --> 00:26:10,635
There was trouble because of me.

255
00:26:10,802 --> 00:26:15,607
You got involved, your men,
Janet and her baby.

256
00:26:15,674 --> 00:26:18,243
Maxine, everything happened for a reason.

257
00:26:19,544 --> 00:26:22,013
It proved that you were right.

258
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,214
I am right?

259
00:26:25,317 --> 00:26:26,484
Right about what?

260
00:26:26,551 --> 00:26:29,054
That we are not really meant
for each other.

261
00:26:31,089 --> 00:26:32,924
I'm a soldier and you're a doctor.

262
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:36,928
We won't really get along.

263
00:26:37,228 --> 00:26:38,463
You're a good soldier.

264
00:26:40,398 --> 00:26:43,501
I was wrong before.
It was wrong for me to judge you.

265
00:26:49,641 --> 00:26:51,176
Lucas, don't leave me, please.

266
00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:57,315
This is what I have been telling you.

267
00:26:58,383 --> 00:27:00,118
This will always happen.

268
00:27:01,486 --> 00:27:02,687
This is my job.

269
00:27:04,422 --> 00:27:06,524
This is part of my job as a soldier.

270
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:10,261
I will always have to leave.
I will go wherever I'm needed.

271
00:27:11,763 --> 00:27:14,265
I will always leave.
I will always say goodbye...

272
00:27:18,036 --> 00:27:19,070
even to this place

273
00:27:21,973 --> 00:27:23,074
even to you.

274
00:27:51,636 --> 00:27:53,104
I need your help.

275
00:27:53,171 --> 00:27:55,607
PRG needs money
so it can bounce back again.

276
00:27:55,674 --> 00:27:57,208
How can I help you?

277
00:27:57,275 --> 00:27:59,811
I know you are still doing
your diamond-smuggling racket.

278
00:27:59,878 --> 00:28:02,213
-I'm just a simple manager.
-A simple manager?

279
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:05,450
We know that you're hiding
some diamonds here.

280
00:28:05,517 --> 00:28:08,253
Sir, what brings you here? What's up?

281
00:28:08,319 --> 00:28:10,455
-Is there a problem?
-This is our territory.

282
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:11,690
You're not allowed here.

283
00:28:11,756 --> 00:28:12,924
Do you want me to treat you?

284
00:28:16,327 --> 00:28:17,729
Did someone die?

285
00:28:17,796 --> 00:28:20,598
It's my friend and her baby.

286
00:28:21,099 --> 00:28:22,634
Goodbye, Janet.
