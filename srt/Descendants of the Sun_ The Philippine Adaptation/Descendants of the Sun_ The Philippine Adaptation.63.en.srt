1
00:00:13,346 --> 00:00:15,415
-Let go of my sister!
-Brother!

2
00:00:15,482 --> 00:00:17,851
Bullet took Maxine.

3
00:00:18,451 --> 00:00:20,186
<i>I repeat. Bullet took Maxine.</i>

4
00:00:21,688 --> 00:00:23,757
Whatever you and your boss
are planning is not gonna happen!

5
00:00:23,823 --> 00:00:24,657
It's over!

6
00:00:33,099 --> 00:00:33,967
Brother.

7
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:35,635
-Brother!
-Bullet!

8
00:00:36,936 --> 00:00:38,238
Let Maxine go.

9
00:00:39,639 --> 00:00:42,042
Brother, stop it.

10
00:00:42,108 --> 00:00:44,878
Can't you really let go of your anger
for my sake?

11
00:00:44,944 --> 00:00:46,846
For your sister?

12
00:00:53,019 --> 00:00:54,888
You are a traitor, Maxine!

13
00:00:54,954 --> 00:00:56,122
Brother!

14
00:00:56,189 --> 00:00:58,625
You are a worthless sister!

15
00:00:58,691 --> 00:01:00,160
-Brother!
-No!

16
00:01:06,933 --> 00:01:10,236
The Alpha Team are all here,
but they are weak and wounded.

17
00:01:10,303 --> 00:01:12,672
We can attack them.

18
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:14,307
We will finish them.

19
00:01:14,374 --> 00:01:16,209
Snoopy lost a lot of blood.

20
00:01:16,276 --> 00:01:20,146
Go with Snoopy and Maxine
to the Medicube.

21
00:01:20,213 --> 00:01:21,648
Wolf and I will stay behind.

22
00:01:21,714 --> 00:01:23,483
What? Lucas?

23
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:25,251
I'm the leader of the Alpha Team.

24
00:01:32,325 --> 00:01:33,626
Big Boss, run!

25
00:01:42,836 --> 00:01:47,073
It will be difficult for us to identify
which among the bodies are of our enemies.

26
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:49,175
Wolf and Big Boss are not here.

27
00:01:49,242 --> 00:01:50,577
Where are they?

28
00:01:53,179 --> 00:01:54,414
What is that?

29
00:01:54,481 --> 00:01:56,483
They found these
along with the two bodies.

30
00:01:56,549 --> 00:01:58,885
It's hard to conclude
if they're Captain Manalo

31
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:01,221
and Technical Sergeant Ramos.

32
00:02:01,287 --> 00:02:02,789
That's not Diego.

33
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:06,559
It will take a while before they can
identify all the victims of the explosion.

34
00:02:06,626 --> 00:02:08,528
That can't be Diego.

35
00:02:10,096 --> 00:02:11,931
It can't be Diego.

36
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:50,436
Nurse Emma and Nurse Via
were given orders to pack your things.

37
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:55,141
Doc, it's better if we just leave.

38
00:02:55,208 --> 00:02:58,044
Let's just wait for updates in Manila.

39
00:02:58,678 --> 00:03:01,814
No. We're not leaving.

40
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:04,150
Give me that.

41
00:03:04,784 --> 00:03:05,718
Give it to me.

42
00:03:06,486 --> 00:03:07,754
No one will leave.

43
00:03:08,588 --> 00:03:09,822
Captain Defensor.

44
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:15,595
You need to report to Camp Aguinaldo.

45
00:03:18,164 --> 00:03:19,666
You are no longer safe here.

46
00:03:19,732 --> 00:03:22,068
Especially you, Doctor Dela Cruz.

47
00:03:22,135 --> 00:03:26,739
You said your brother is very mad at you
and you were his target.

48
00:03:26,806 --> 00:03:28,942
You are not the only one
who could be in danger.

49
00:03:29,008 --> 00:03:33,313
It's also the camp
and your patients in the Medicube.

50
00:03:34,681 --> 00:03:36,316
How about Lucas?

51
00:03:37,317 --> 00:03:39,719
Where are they right now?
What happened to them?

52
00:03:39,786 --> 00:03:42,755
You're not even sure
if it's their bodies that you found.

53
00:03:44,123 --> 00:03:46,759
We will update you wherever you may be.

54
00:03:50,597 --> 00:03:52,031
I'm in-charge here.

55
00:03:55,535 --> 00:03:56,636
No.

56
00:03:56,703 --> 00:03:59,305
You can't just send us away.

57
00:03:59,839 --> 00:04:06,412
Doctor, I won't hesitate to use force
if you will not follow my order.

58
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:10,250
I know what happened is difficult for you.

59
00:04:10,316 --> 00:04:15,388
But I have to prioritize
the safety of the entire camp.

60
00:04:16,155 --> 00:04:18,992
So, I suggest you just cooperate.

61
00:05:09,942 --> 00:05:11,110
Doc Maxine.

62
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:23,823
Please give this to Lucas.
He might look for it.

63
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:34,367
Is there really no update yet?

64
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:39,505
Colonel Garcia is probably
annoyed with me by now.

65
00:05:41,374 --> 00:05:44,744
So, they really haven't returned yet?

66
00:05:49,282 --> 00:05:52,085
Since I came back to work,

67
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:59,459
I've been expecting Lucas
to suddenly show up.

68
00:06:01,627 --> 00:06:04,297
That a familiar voice will call me,

69
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:11,571
with a cup of coffee or donut.

70
00:06:29,489 --> 00:06:31,023
By the way I'm Lucas.

71
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:33,059
Lucas Manalo.

72
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:36,195
You are Doctor Maxine Dela Cruz, right?

73
00:06:36,262 --> 00:06:38,564
I already asked around.

74
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:45,371
We'll get you out of here.

75
00:06:46,472 --> 00:06:48,341
Maxine, run!

76
00:06:51,844 --> 00:06:53,713
Just trust me. Hold tight.

77
00:07:02,989 --> 00:07:05,892
If we really love each other,
we will fight for it.

78
00:07:06,492 --> 00:07:09,629
Even if I get wounded, get hurt

79
00:07:09,695 --> 00:07:11,130
or even if I die
as long as I accomplish my mission.

80
00:07:11,197 --> 00:07:12,131
That's what matters.

81
00:07:12,198 --> 00:07:13,499
-Lucas.
-Stay still.

82
00:07:13,566 --> 00:07:15,368
You know I will never hurt you.

83
00:07:18,304 --> 00:07:19,405
Run!

84
00:07:26,913 --> 00:07:28,147
We will be right behind you.

85
00:07:29,348 --> 00:07:32,852
I won't let you miss me too much, okay?

86
00:07:39,192 --> 00:07:41,294
I'm not losing hope.

87
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:47,066
As long as it has not been confirmed
that the bodies found are theirs,

88
00:07:49,769 --> 00:07:52,004
I won't believe they are dead.

89
00:08:16,562 --> 00:08:18,030
I'm lucky I met her.

90
00:08:18,097 --> 00:08:19,265
Your girlfriend is cute.

91
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:20,399
This?

92
00:08:21,033 --> 00:08:22,335
We're just friends.

93
00:08:23,769 --> 00:08:26,973
Just a second. Why did you get these?

94
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:28,708
What do you want me to do?

95
00:08:28,774 --> 00:08:33,145
The stall owner begged me to take these
just so we won't return.

96
00:08:33,212 --> 00:08:35,648
I think he got scared when you said
we will come back to play

97
00:08:35,715 --> 00:08:38,084
and we'd get all the prizes.

98
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:20,753
We found these together
with Technical Sergeant Ramos' stuff.

99
00:10:21,921 --> 00:10:25,124
What is this?
What is the meaning of this?

100
00:10:25,191 --> 00:10:28,961
It is the team's practice
to write a letter to our loved ones

101
00:10:29,028 --> 00:10:32,064
before a mission or an assignment.

102
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:34,433
Just in case something happens.

103
00:10:38,771 --> 00:10:40,473
Permission to leave, ma'am.

104
00:11:32,658 --> 00:11:36,162
<i>Forgive me for the time I've wasted,</i>

105
00:11:36,829 --> 00:11:41,233
<i>when I chose to leave
rather than fight for what I feel.</i>

106
00:11:43,069 --> 00:11:44,470
Be careful here.

107
00:11:45,604 --> 00:11:47,173
The land is not even.

108
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:51,777
And make sure you always wear
your uniform

109
00:11:51,844 --> 00:11:54,380
so you won't get bitten
by big mosquitoes.

110
00:11:54,447 --> 00:11:56,348
You confuse me, Diego.

111
00:11:57,349 --> 00:11:59,852
Aren't you happy that I'm here too?

112
00:12:02,254 --> 00:12:05,157
We should worry about Captain Manalo.
All eyes are on him.

113
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:06,659
He knows what he got himself into.

114
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:08,994
He just did what is right.
That's how a leader should be.

115
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:11,630
Brave and principled.

116
00:12:11,697 --> 00:12:15,434
No wonder the General chose him for you.

117
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:21,407
You are the bravest woman I have ever met.

118
00:12:23,776 --> 00:12:26,011
You should not cry because of me.

119
00:12:27,613 --> 00:12:29,381
So if you'll only get hurt…

120
00:12:31,817 --> 00:12:33,319
it's better if you leave me, Moira.

121
00:12:35,855 --> 00:12:37,156
You should forget about me.

122
00:12:37,223 --> 00:12:39,058
What's the problem, Diego?

123
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:41,293
We are not meant for each other.

124
00:12:43,696 --> 00:12:45,231
I'm sorry.

125
00:12:46,398 --> 00:12:52,338
<i>What happened to me
and your dad is no joke, Moira.</i>

126
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:57,643
<i>It feels like I got betrayed
by someone I respected.</i>

127
00:13:00,913 --> 00:13:02,248
What about us?

128
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:06,452
What about us?

129
00:13:12,358 --> 00:13:14,693
Diego?

130
00:13:19,532 --> 00:13:26,038
<i>You are too kind and brave.
You always seem to shine.</i>

131
00:13:35,848 --> 00:13:37,583
<i>I know I've hurt you.</i>

132
00:13:38,017 --> 00:13:41,086
I made you suffer
for something that you didn't do.

133
00:13:43,622 --> 00:13:45,624
Forgive me.

134
00:13:52,031 --> 00:13:53,399
Just stay with me.

135
00:13:59,405 --> 00:14:01,507
<i>It looks like someone close to him died.</i>

136
00:14:01,574 --> 00:14:03,509
Don't tease him.

137
00:14:03,576 --> 00:14:06,378
Not everyone is as lucky as we are.

138
00:14:07,479 --> 00:14:09,248
It feels good, Big Boss.

139
00:14:09,315 --> 00:14:11,750
Oh, come here.

140
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:18,490
I only have one request, Diego.
Don't hurt Moira.

141
00:14:26,765 --> 00:14:29,635
<i>Finally, no one can stop us.</i>

142
00:14:30,302 --> 00:14:34,273
<i>I can't believe you loved someone like me.</i>

143
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:40,346
<i>You are the most beautiful thing
that happened to me, Moira.</i>

144
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:47,346
<i>Maxine, as I write this</i>

145
00:15:47,413 --> 00:15:50,749
<i>I pray that you won't have to read it.</i>

146
00:15:52,117 --> 00:15:56,221
<i>But if this ever lands in your hands,</i>

147
00:15:56,288 --> 00:16:01,327
<i>it means I wasn't able
to fulfil my promise to you.</i>

148
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:06,298
<i>I told you not to worry.</i>

149
00:16:06,365 --> 00:16:08,434
<i>I won't get hurt.</i>

150
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:12,771
<i>I can handle anything,
and I will come back to you.</i>

151
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:17,509
<i>I failed to fulfil all of that.</i>

152
00:16:22,581 --> 00:16:26,018
<i>You've been making me
every since we met, Maxine.</i>

153
00:16:27,119 --> 00:16:28,921
<i>I loved you with all my heart.</i>

154
00:16:30,289 --> 00:16:34,393
<i>Even if the time given to us was short,</i>

155
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:38,163
<i>I thank God for bringing you into my life.</i>

156
00:16:38,864 --> 00:16:43,402
<i>Even in death, you are always in my heart.</i>

157
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:33,185
No matter how busy you are,
if you love someone,

158
00:17:33,252 --> 00:17:35,587
you will find a way to be with her.

159
00:17:41,026 --> 00:17:43,195
Just calm down. I got you.

160
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:54,773
Let's go out on a date next week, please?

161
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:58,343
We can see a movie, okay?

162
00:18:02,948 --> 00:18:06,752
Don't cry, they might think
we're having a lovers' quarrel.

163
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:13,859
Welcome back to Urdan, Doc.

164
00:18:17,963 --> 00:18:22,201
As a soldier,
it's my duty to protect all of you.

165
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:23,268
To protect you.

166
00:18:24,336 --> 00:18:26,738
So wherever you go, I will be with you.

167
00:18:29,074 --> 00:18:30,742
I'm happy because I'm with you.

168
00:19:00,172 --> 00:19:02,007
Yes, I'm jealous.

169
00:19:02,074 --> 00:19:06,111
So please, stay away from him. Please?

170
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:22,294
<i>It looks like we'll never
understand each other.</i>

171
00:19:22,361 --> 00:19:24,730
<i>I told you, we're too different
from one another.</i>

172
00:19:24,796 --> 00:19:28,934
But why do I still like you very much?

173
00:20:02,501 --> 00:20:04,269
<i>I won't break up with you.</i>

174
00:20:07,239 --> 00:20:08,173
I love you.

175
00:20:12,244 --> 00:20:13,579
Brother!

176
00:20:17,082 --> 00:20:19,151
<i>Yes, you've hurt me, but I love you.</i>

177
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:36,768
Have you seen Sergeant Tamayo?

178
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:44,476
Have you seen Sergeant Tamayo?
I need to talk to him.

179
00:20:44,543 --> 00:20:46,545
I'm sorry, ma'am.
I haven't seen him.

180
00:20:53,285 --> 00:20:54,519
Moira!

181
00:20:55,354 --> 00:20:57,322
Moira, what is the meaning of this?

182
00:21:09,968 --> 00:21:13,772
Moira, why did they give these to us?

183
00:21:14,606 --> 00:21:17,109
Are they saying that Lucas
and Diego are gone?

184
00:21:17,175 --> 00:21:18,744
That they are no longer returning?

185
00:21:19,511 --> 00:21:20,746
Moira, what is it?

186
00:21:21,546 --> 00:21:25,217
-What did your dad say?
-I also don't know, Maxine.

187
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:27,853
Dad won't tell me anything.

188
00:21:31,189 --> 00:21:36,928
Every time I look at him,
all I see is pity in his eyes.

189
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:41,800
I'm also losing hope.

190
00:21:47,372 --> 00:21:48,907
Moira, this can't be.

191
00:21:50,475 --> 00:21:54,279
That can't be the last time I saw Lucas.
No, I won't allow it.

192
00:21:54,346 --> 00:21:55,547
Maxine.

193
00:22:03,121 --> 00:22:06,425
I still have to talk to him.

194
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:10,629
I still have a lot of things
to say to him.

195
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:17,035
I didn't even get to hug him.

196
00:22:19,838 --> 00:22:22,507
We still have to fix things.
It can't be like this.

197
00:22:22,574 --> 00:22:23,742
I don't want this.

198
00:22:23,809 --> 00:22:25,177
This is not possible.

199
00:22:25,811 --> 00:22:27,713
It can't be like this, Moira.

200
00:23:56,067 --> 00:23:58,770
Rise and shine, my dear guests.

201
00:24:39,044 --> 00:24:40,278
Are you excited to go home?

202
00:24:46,852 --> 00:24:50,288
They have been loyal to you.
And you'll just give up on them like this?

203
00:24:50,355 --> 00:24:52,290
This is also not easy for me, Moira.

204
00:24:52,357 --> 00:24:56,962
I just want to give Captain Manalo
and Sergeant Ramos

205
00:24:57,028 --> 00:24:58,463
an honorable recognition.

206
00:24:58,530 --> 00:25:01,166
-Are you ready for your last mission?
-What mission?

207
00:25:01,233 --> 00:25:04,302
-You want to go home, right?
-Why? What do you want us to do?

208
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:09,207
Even though it's hard to accept, ma'am,

209
00:25:09,274 --> 00:25:12,511
I will go to give honor to the person
who gave direction to my life.

210
00:25:12,577 --> 00:25:15,947
I know Diego will be proud of you
wherever he is.

211
00:25:16,014 --> 00:25:18,216
I want to say sorry.

212
00:25:18,283 --> 00:25:19,751
I didn't fight for you.

213
00:25:19,818 --> 00:25:21,253
I love you, Lucas.

214
00:25:21,319 --> 00:25:22,954
I love you so much.

215
00:25:34,499 --> 00:25:35,433
Go ahead!
