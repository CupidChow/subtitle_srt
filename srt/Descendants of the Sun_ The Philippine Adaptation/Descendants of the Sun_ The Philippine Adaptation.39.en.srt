1
00:00:15,982 --> 00:00:20,387
<i>Looks like we now know what's in the mind</i>
<i>and heart of Doc Maxine.</i>

2
00:00:20,453 --> 00:00:26,092
The truth came out
when you were most scared.

3
00:00:26,159 --> 00:00:28,895
But why did things change
after I saved you?

4
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:32,565
I told you Captain Manalo and Doc Maxine
would eventually become a couple.

5
00:00:32,632 --> 00:00:34,667
-I lost?
-What is that?

6
00:00:34,734 --> 00:00:36,970
You should get one of these, Marty.

7
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:41,341
Once you have this,
you will never lose any bet.

8
00:00:41,408 --> 00:00:44,477
Why did Doc Maxine
still run away from you, Big Boss?

9
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:48,782
You know her feelings for you
and you're still not a couple?

10
00:00:48,848 --> 00:00:50,750
Maxine is really different.

11
00:00:50,817 --> 00:00:55,922
That's why you like her, right?
Because she's different.

12
00:00:55,989 --> 00:00:58,191
Is it all right for you
that your boyfriend is a soldier?

13
00:00:58,258 --> 00:01:01,895
You and Maxine asked the same question.

14
00:01:01,961 --> 00:01:05,131
<i>I just wanted to thank you</i>
<i>for what you did for Captain Manalo.</i>

15
00:01:05,198 --> 00:01:07,634
<i>You went far and above your duty</i>
<i>as a doctor</i>

16
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:09,836
<i>to make sure our men are safe.</i>

17
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:12,338
I want to talk to you
about personal matters.

18
00:01:12,405 --> 00:01:15,642
And what we are going to talk about
will not leave

19
00:01:15,708 --> 00:01:17,343
the four corners of this tent.

20
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:29,522
I heard the confession of Dr. Dela Cruz
about her feelings for you.

21
00:01:35,228 --> 00:01:37,697
Don't you feel anything for my daughter?

22
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:38,932
Dad, please.

23
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:54,447
I admire Captain Defensor
because she's a good doctor

24
00:01:55,148 --> 00:01:56,749
and a good friend.

25
00:01:59,452 --> 00:02:03,022
But that's the only relationship
we have, sir.

26
00:02:28,047 --> 00:02:29,048
Where are Diego and Moira?

27
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:34,621
The General is still talking to them.
It looks like it will take some time.

28
00:02:34,687 --> 00:02:38,558
I think we should go back to the camp
ahead of them.

29
00:02:39,626 --> 00:02:40,627
Just the two of us?

30
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:44,464
Don't worry.
I will not force you to admit anything.

31
00:02:45,198 --> 00:02:47,700
I've already heard what I want to hear.
So, that's enough.

32
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:50,837
Fine, give me the keys.

33
00:02:50,904 --> 00:02:54,440
I'll drive so if you tease me,
I can ask you to get out of the car.

34
00:03:09,622 --> 00:03:13,626
Dad, please respect me
and my relationship with Diego.

35
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:15,061
Moira.

36
00:03:15,128 --> 00:03:18,565
Diego followed all your orders.
He passed all your tests.

37
00:03:18,631 --> 00:03:20,366
What else does Diego have to do?

38
00:03:29,909 --> 00:03:32,178
I saw how serious he is about you.

39
00:03:32,245 --> 00:03:34,280
He is dedicated to being a soldier.

40
00:03:34,347 --> 00:03:39,586
I also saw how he puts the needs of others
at his own expense.

41
00:03:41,588 --> 00:03:43,723
He proved himself to me.

42
00:03:52,465 --> 00:03:53,466
But,

43
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:55,101
whoever holds this…

44
00:03:58,071 --> 00:03:58,938
wins, right?

45
00:04:56,329 --> 00:04:59,532
Do you think I will break up with Diego
just because you have that?

46
00:04:59,599 --> 00:05:01,434
Did I tell you to break up with him?

47
00:05:19,719 --> 00:05:20,820
I admit it.

48
00:05:22,255 --> 00:05:26,793
I cannot win this fight
because my daughter chose you.

49
00:05:36,135 --> 00:05:37,904
I only have one request, Diego.

50
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:40,139
Don't hurt Moira.

51
00:05:48,581 --> 00:05:50,416
Are you really giving us
your approval, Dad?

52
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:23,683
You know how to drive
but you don't know how to change tires.

53
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:27,387
How can I replace it?
There is no spare tire.

54
00:06:27,453 --> 00:06:28,755
What do you mean there's none?

55
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:35,228
So? What did I say?

56
00:06:42,935 --> 00:06:47,373
Base, SOS. We're near the beach.
We have a flat tire.

57
00:06:49,108 --> 00:06:50,943
Will Diego and Moira be okay?

58
00:06:51,778 --> 00:06:53,646
How about the General?
Does he approve of them?

59
00:06:53,713 --> 00:06:54,914
-Them?
-Yes.

60
00:06:54,981 --> 00:06:56,716
It seems they are okay.

61
00:06:56,783 --> 00:07:01,387
It looks like the story
of our love triangle is over,

62
00:07:01,454 --> 00:07:05,358
especially after you
broadcast your feelings.

63
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:08,428
I warned you, didn't I? We have a deal.

64
00:07:11,798 --> 00:07:13,833
Maxine, why do you feel awkward?

65
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:15,101
Because…

66
00:07:16,402 --> 00:07:20,139
I told you how I feel about you?
I said I like you.

67
00:07:20,206 --> 00:07:23,743
So, what if I found out how you feel?

68
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:25,511
Okay. Let's make things fair.

69
00:07:25,578 --> 00:07:28,381
I'll do the same thing
when we return to the camp.

70
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:32,018
I will broadcast my feelings for you
for everyone to hear.

71
00:07:32,084 --> 00:07:34,587
-What do you think?
-Unbelievable.

72
00:07:47,066 --> 00:07:49,335
-Maybe the signal here is weak.
-I don't have any signal.

73
00:07:49,402 --> 00:07:52,071
-I think it's a dead spot.
-The signal here is really weak.

74
00:07:55,775 --> 00:07:57,376
Maybe the signal is stronger there.

75
00:07:58,544 --> 00:07:59,412
Right?

76
00:08:03,816 --> 00:08:04,750
Let's go.

77
00:08:18,197 --> 00:08:19,565
Are you okay, Moira?

78
00:08:21,267 --> 00:08:23,202
Do you need a bomb squad?

79
00:08:23,269 --> 00:08:25,137
It looks like you will explode
with happiness.

80
00:08:25,204 --> 00:08:28,307
I really can't believe
our problem with Dad is over.

81
00:08:29,709 --> 00:08:31,644
Why did he suddenly change his mind?

82
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,615
Is it really sudden?

83
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:40,152
My body is aching all over
after serving him.

84
00:08:40,219 --> 00:08:42,555
-Maybe he's sick.
-What?

85
00:08:42,622 --> 00:08:44,690
Maybe he's just not telling me.

86
00:08:44,757 --> 00:08:48,060
Maybe he was shocked
so he just gave his approval.

87
00:08:48,694 --> 00:08:50,263
He's not like that, Moira.

88
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:54,967
Your father is not sick
and he loves you very much.

89
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:58,504
He just wants you to be happy.

90
00:08:59,005 --> 00:09:00,106
And as for me,

91
00:09:00,673 --> 00:09:03,776
I am Technical Sergeant Diego Ramos
of the Special Forces.

92
00:09:04,277 --> 00:09:05,945
Tasked to make
Captain Moira Defensor happy

93
00:09:06,012 --> 00:09:08,180
and to take care of her.

94
00:09:21,594 --> 00:09:24,330
I said at ease, Sergeant.

95
00:09:39,045 --> 00:09:40,646
This place is really beautiful.

96
00:09:42,214 --> 00:09:44,850
This is what I will miss
the most about Urdan.

97
00:09:45,384 --> 00:09:46,218
Really?

98
00:09:48,888 --> 00:09:49,889
Only this?

99
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:05,104
Are you still leaving, Maxine?
Will you really stay away from me?

100
00:10:05,171 --> 00:10:08,074
I don't know what will happen to us.

101
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:14,213
It feels like I will have a heart attack
if I continue with this.

102
00:10:16,682 --> 00:10:18,217
I will always be scared.

103
00:10:19,251 --> 00:10:21,020
I will always worry.

104
00:10:27,593 --> 00:10:31,430
You know, it's better if I just avoid it.

105
00:10:32,865 --> 00:10:35,101
I'll just go back to my old life.

106
00:10:38,004 --> 00:10:41,040
There are many reasons
to leave this place, right?

107
00:10:57,023 --> 00:10:59,558
But there is one reason
that's keeping me from doing that.

108
00:11:03,262 --> 00:11:04,263
Fine.

109
00:11:05,464 --> 00:11:06,599
I give up.

110
00:11:07,066 --> 00:11:12,038
Even though it's difficult,
complicated, and scary.

111
00:11:12,571 --> 00:11:14,540
At least, I won't have any regrets.

112
00:11:15,808 --> 00:11:18,244
I won't regret that I did not tell you.

113
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:22,548
I love you, Lucas.

114
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:36,589
Mister, you're conscious.

115
00:12:39,358 --> 00:12:40,593
Where am I?

116
00:12:40,659 --> 00:12:42,928
You are in Rio Poblacion
Public Hospital, sir.

117
00:12:42,995 --> 00:12:45,765
It has been two weeks
since you've been confined here.

118
00:12:45,831 --> 00:12:48,267
Why am I here? What happened to me?

119
00:12:48,334 --> 00:12:50,870
You can't remember anything, sir?
What is your name?

120
00:13:00,713 --> 00:13:01,881
I don't know.

121
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:06,118
Why don't I know my name?

122
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,789
-Why can't I remember?
-Sir, calm down.

123
00:13:09,855 --> 00:13:12,625
-No! I'm leaving!
-Sir, you can't leave.

124
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:17,429
Joey, help me!

125
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:21,066
Doc, the patient is trying to escape!

126
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:24,203
Let me go! I can't stay here!

127
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:26,438
-Sir, calm down.
-I said let me go!

128
00:13:27,072 --> 00:13:28,774
-Let me go!
-Nurse, where's the medication?

129
00:13:28,841 --> 00:13:31,143
-It's over there.
-Let me go!

130
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:35,548
I don't want to stay here!
I said let me go!

131
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:37,683
Let me go!

132
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:41,187
I'm leaving! Let me go! I said let me go.

133
00:13:42,254 --> 00:13:43,489
Let me go.

134
00:13:45,224 --> 00:13:48,093
Let me go.

135
00:13:49,762 --> 00:13:51,130
Let me go.

136
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:53,699
Let me go.

137
00:13:55,734 --> 00:13:58,437
Take him to the isolated room
and call the police.

138
00:14:08,414 --> 00:14:10,216
-Hey!
-Wait, will you check on me?

139
00:14:10,282 --> 00:14:12,184
-Hey, that hurts.
-Am I dreaming?

140
00:14:12,251 --> 00:14:15,020
What's with you? What are you doing?

141
00:14:16,789 --> 00:14:18,357
Am I dreaming?

142
00:14:19,558 --> 00:14:21,227
-One more time.
-Yes.

143
00:14:21,293 --> 00:14:23,128
This is a dream.
This is just your imagination.

144
00:14:23,195 --> 00:14:25,764
Of course, it's not!

145
00:14:27,233 --> 00:14:30,870
Is it true what you just said?
What did you just say?

146
00:14:30,936 --> 00:14:34,039
-You don't want it? All right.
-No.

147
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,008
I've waited so long for this.

148
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:41,947
So, are we a couple now?

149
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:45,084
Are we?

150
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:57,029
Do you remember
the first time we came here?

151
00:15:01,667 --> 00:15:06,472
You know, they say
that if you take a pebble from this place,

152
00:15:06,538 --> 00:15:08,507
you will definitely come back.

153
00:15:17,182 --> 00:15:19,318
I hope when that day comes
for us to return,

154
00:15:20,486 --> 00:15:24,623
we'll already be a couple.

155
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,402
-You don't remember anymore, right?
-I do.

156
00:15:49,081 --> 00:15:50,349
You kept it.

157
00:15:56,488 --> 00:15:58,223
If something is special to you

158
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:01,493
you will take good care of it.

159
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:01,120
Oh, no!

160
00:17:02,554 --> 00:17:06,358
What if your dad suddenly takes back
his approval of our relationship?

161
00:17:06,425 --> 00:17:08,160
You know my father.

162
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:13,198
When he makes a decision, it's final.

163
00:17:14,466 --> 00:17:15,601
Finally.

164
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:20,139
No one can stop us.

165
00:17:59,645 --> 00:18:01,113
I just need to make sure.

166
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:21,100
It did not break
even when soaked in cold water.

167
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:22,768
How much will you pay for all of these?

168
00:18:54,867 --> 00:18:56,001
Hey.

169
00:18:58,370 --> 00:19:00,005
Somebody's in a good mood.

170
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:09,014
It's a mission accomplished for me.

171
00:19:09,948 --> 00:19:13,318
I've accomplished my mission, Big Boss.

172
00:19:13,385 --> 00:19:15,220
Which one?

173
00:19:15,287 --> 00:19:16,255
Look at this.

174
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:20,559
Brigadier General Defensor
already raised his white flag to me.

175
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:24,563
He accepted me for Moira.

176
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:25,831
Good.

177
00:19:33,639 --> 00:19:35,807
You think you're the only one
who's accomplished mission?

178
00:19:39,778 --> 00:19:41,613
Here's the good news.

179
00:19:44,116 --> 00:19:45,384
It's all okay.

180
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:47,152
-Okay?
-It's all okay.

181
00:19:47,986 --> 00:19:49,121
She said yes to me.

182
00:19:49,922 --> 00:19:50,923
We're a couple now.

183
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:53,992
That's good.

184
00:19:54,059 --> 00:19:57,162
-You thought you're the only one.
-We're both winners.

185
00:19:57,229 --> 00:19:59,031
-What happens now?
-What do you mean?

186
00:19:59,097 --> 00:20:01,800
We both have Commanding Officers.

187
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:08,840
Big Boss, extra-curricular affairs
are no longer allowed.

188
00:20:10,842 --> 00:20:12,144
What extra-curricular affairs?

189
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:13,478
You.

190
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:14,646
-Me?
-Yes.

191
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:15,714
I'm loyal.

192
00:20:15,781 --> 00:20:19,585
You're the one
who loves to go out on blind dates.

193
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:23,755
-That has to stop.
-Of course. No more of that.

194
00:20:23,822 --> 00:20:25,324
-We are loyal.
-That's the end of it.

195
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:27,593
Let's leave it all in the past.

196
00:20:28,794 --> 00:20:32,264
Big Boss, this is our big secret.

197
00:20:33,031 --> 00:20:37,703
We don't want Maxine
and Moira to beat us up.

198
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:41,740
-Deal?
-Okay. Wilco.

199
00:20:42,841 --> 00:20:44,109
Will comply.

200
00:21:06,164 --> 00:21:08,033
You look so blooming, Doc.

201
00:21:09,067 --> 00:21:10,102
Really?

202
00:21:10,869 --> 00:21:13,305
-It's true.
-Stop it.

203
00:21:13,372 --> 00:21:17,309
-I did not do anything. I'm just writing.
-It's true.

204
00:21:17,976 --> 00:21:19,878
It's really different
if you have a love life.

205
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:21,880
You look more beautiful.

206
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:25,884
This is nothing.
I hope you'll have one too.

207
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:28,520
So we'll both look beautiful.

208
00:21:30,422 --> 00:21:35,027
-Congratulations, Doc Maxine.
-Oh, my! You startled me.

209
00:21:35,093 --> 00:21:37,863
The good news is all over Urdan.

210
00:21:37,929 --> 00:21:40,132
You and Captain Lucas
really look good together.

211
00:21:40,198 --> 00:21:43,935
-I'm thrilled.
-Is it really all over the place?

212
00:21:44,002 --> 00:21:47,439
But how's that, Doc? We're leaving, right?

213
00:21:49,007 --> 00:21:52,577
I just talked to Doctor Chavez.
Our stay here is extended.

214
00:21:52,644 --> 00:21:55,180
That means more time to serve, right?

215
00:21:55,247 --> 00:21:58,183
And more time for love.

216
00:21:58,250 --> 00:21:59,318
Hey.

217
00:22:00,252 --> 00:22:04,990
Guys, our package has arrived from Manila.
And there's an extra package here.

218
00:22:05,057 --> 00:22:07,359
Who sent it? What package is that?

219
00:22:11,663 --> 00:22:12,764
It's for Diego.

220
00:22:17,769 --> 00:22:20,372
Wolf, the rehabilitation tomorrow
is at 0700.

221
00:22:22,274 --> 00:22:23,642
I will tell the whole team.

222
00:22:23,909 --> 00:22:26,845
Technical Sergeant Diego Ramos?

223
00:22:26,912 --> 00:22:30,515
<i>You have a package here from Lovely Tan.</i>
<i>Kindly get it, please.</i>

224
00:22:49,401 --> 00:22:51,002
Doc Beauty, where are you?

225
00:22:53,472 --> 00:22:54,940
I'm in the Medicube.

226
00:23:00,312 --> 00:23:02,180
Diego has no other family.

227
00:23:02,748 --> 00:23:04,549
Who will send him a package?

228
00:23:16,194 --> 00:23:19,030
-Give me that.
-Hey. What was that about?

229
00:23:19,097 --> 00:23:20,999
I want to see what's inside.

230
00:23:21,933 --> 00:23:23,101
Get out of the way.

231
00:23:35,781 --> 00:23:38,083
That's what it says. It even has a heart.

232
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:39,951
A heart!

233
00:23:41,186 --> 00:23:42,754
Does Diego have a sister?

234
00:23:42,821 --> 00:23:44,456
He's an only child.

235
00:23:44,856 --> 00:23:48,660
Why are you shouting at me?
What's up with her?

236
00:23:49,795 --> 00:23:51,730
Hey, look at that.

237
00:24:10,081 --> 00:24:11,650
Why is Lucas there?

238
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:25,130
"This is my first date with Captain Lucas.

239
00:24:25,197 --> 00:24:29,434
Please give this to him
so he won't forget."

240
00:24:33,872 --> 00:24:35,240
You have a gun, right?

241
00:24:46,852 --> 00:24:48,920
The military is complacent right now.

242
00:24:51,189 --> 00:24:54,292
They believe that PRG is laying low.

243
00:24:55,994 --> 00:24:57,629
But they are wrong.

244
00:25:00,065 --> 00:25:04,069
We will strengthen our forces
against them.

245
00:25:06,204 --> 00:25:07,572
I'm getting scared.

246
00:25:07,639 --> 00:25:11,409
How can he protect us
when he was not able to protect Bullet?

247
00:25:11,476 --> 00:25:12,844
Me too.

248
00:25:13,645 --> 00:25:15,113
My children are still young.

249
00:25:15,981 --> 00:25:18,750
But how can we escape?
How can we leave the group?

250
00:25:18,817 --> 00:25:23,555
We'll see. I already made a decision.
We're going to leave the group.

251
00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:30,095
So, tell our former comrades
that PRG needs them.

252
00:25:32,564 --> 00:25:35,133
We'll get back at the military.

253
00:25:50,482 --> 00:25:52,117
What is the meaning of this picture?

254
00:25:55,287 --> 00:25:56,588
You're quite good looking here.

255
00:25:57,556 --> 00:25:59,558
This is the first time
I see you smile like this.

256
00:25:59,624 --> 00:26:00,759
Lucas?

257
00:26:25,584 --> 00:26:27,953
-Time to eat.
-How can I eat? I'm handcuffed.

258
00:26:28,019 --> 00:26:30,755
If I could have it my way,
you'd end up in the police station.

259
00:26:32,324 --> 00:26:33,391
<i>What did you do?</i>

260
00:26:33,458 --> 00:26:36,094
-Did you do something else?
-Negative.

261
00:26:36,161 --> 00:26:37,963
Why don't you admit
you have another woman?

262
00:26:38,029 --> 00:26:40,765
I don't have another woman
because I only have you.

263
00:26:40,832 --> 00:26:42,934
-I want to thank you.
-For what?

264
00:26:43,001 --> 00:26:44,936
Because you approved
of my relationship with Moira.

265
00:26:45,003 --> 00:26:48,440
And I want to ask your permission.
I have plans to marry her.

266
00:26:48,506 --> 00:26:50,909
It seems the military
will be staying here longer.

267
00:26:50,976 --> 00:26:54,412
<i>The locals are getting closer to them.</i>

268
00:26:54,479 --> 00:26:55,847
<i>Just let them be, Rifle.</i>

269
00:26:55,914 --> 00:26:58,550
<i>It would be better for them</i>
<i>to think that the PRG is gone.</i>

270
00:26:58,617 --> 00:27:00,585
<i>Then, we will surprise all of them.</i>
