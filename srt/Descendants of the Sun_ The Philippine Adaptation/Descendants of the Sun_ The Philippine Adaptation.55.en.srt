1
00:00:13,313 --> 00:00:15,048
<i>Even though you are mad at him,</i>

2
00:00:15,115 --> 00:00:17,417
<i>you didn't let your emotions
take over you.</i>

3
00:00:18,518 --> 00:00:21,554
You even helped to operate on him.

4
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:26,059
He risked his life to save me back then.

5
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:28,862
Your brother held you hostage?

6
00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:30,663
Does Captain Lucas already know this?

7
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:33,833
<i>It seems danger
always finds its way to her.</i>

8
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:37,203
Have you asked her
how she got into the PRG camp?

9
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:38,405
She doesn't want to talk.

10
00:00:38,471 --> 00:00:39,939
Could she be hiding something?

11
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:45,678
It is impossible for you
to go there on your own.

12
00:00:45,745 --> 00:00:47,614
Do you have a contact inside the PRG?

13
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,783
Sir, we can't force Maxine to speak.

14
00:00:49,849 --> 00:00:52,118
She's still traumatized by what happened.

15
00:00:52,185 --> 00:00:54,721
If she will not talk,
we can't gather intel.

16
00:00:54,788 --> 00:00:57,290
Big Boss, you should be ready.

17
00:00:57,357 --> 00:01:00,160
For sure, the Colonel
will give Maxine a sanction.

18
00:01:00,226 --> 00:01:01,761
<i>I made a lot of violations.</i>

19
00:01:01,828 --> 00:01:05,165
General Defensor decided
to send me back to Manila.

20
00:01:05,231 --> 00:01:06,833
They can't do that.

21
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,768
<i>How about the medical team?</i>

22
00:01:08,835 --> 00:01:11,237
Maxine, I talked to General Defensor.

23
00:01:12,105 --> 00:01:14,641
He reversed his decision.
You don't have to leave.

24
00:01:14,707 --> 00:01:19,479
Because of my selfishness,
your job is getting affected.

25
00:01:19,546 --> 00:01:21,714
Maxine, you know that I will defend you
at all cost.

26
00:01:21,781 --> 00:01:23,016
I will do everything for you.

27
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:26,386
But you don't have to sacrifice your job
because of me.

28
00:01:26,453 --> 00:01:29,189
And you don't have to defend me
all the time.

29
00:01:29,255 --> 00:01:30,523
You are my girlfriend.

30
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:33,159
That's the thing. I'm your girlfriend.

31
00:01:33,226 --> 00:01:37,230
I should be lifting you up,
not pulling you down.

32
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:40,533
Wait a second. Maxine, I don't get it.

33
00:01:42,969 --> 00:01:44,537
I'm leaving Urdan.

34
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:00,787
It hurts.

35
00:02:00,854 --> 00:02:04,090
Don't move too much,
your wound might open up.

36
00:02:10,697 --> 00:02:12,465
How are you feeling?

37
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:18,671
My body feels heavy.

38
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:21,774
That's normal.

39
00:02:28,348 --> 00:02:30,783
Did you watch over me the whole time?

40
00:02:32,352 --> 00:02:35,021
I just want to make sure you will be okay.

41
00:02:59,779 --> 00:03:01,681
I just want to say thank you.

42
00:03:09,489 --> 00:03:11,991
Despite everything I did to you.

43
00:03:16,563 --> 00:03:18,331
You don't have to say thank you.

44
00:03:24,537 --> 00:03:26,372
I'm just doing my job.

45
00:03:35,114 --> 00:03:37,684
Just focus on your recovery.

46
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:39,852
Captain Lucas needs you.

47
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:42,422
The Alpha Team is not complete
without you.

48
00:03:44,023 --> 00:03:45,925
I'll be back to check on you.

49
00:03:57,770 --> 00:04:00,540
Lucas won't allow me to leave Urdan.

50
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:04,043
He really loves you.

51
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:06,112
He doesn't want to be away from you.

52
00:04:07,447 --> 00:04:10,183
But his job is getting affected
because of me.

53
00:04:13,119 --> 00:04:18,925
If only my brother did not become a rebel,
things wouldn't be this complicated.

54
00:04:20,059 --> 00:04:21,094
I don't know.

55
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:25,898
My life is such a mess. What now?

56
00:04:25,965 --> 00:04:31,004
Doc, why don't you tell Captain Lucas
about your brother?

57
00:04:33,573 --> 00:04:36,576
They hate each other to the bone.

58
00:04:36,643 --> 00:04:38,911
It will only make matters worse,
believe me.

59
00:04:38,978 --> 00:04:43,049
But, Doc, do you trust Captain Lucas?

60
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:44,951
I do, of course.

61
00:04:45,018 --> 00:04:48,521
So you should not be afraid to tell him.

62
00:04:48,588 --> 00:04:51,624
Because if Captain Lucas really loves you,

63
00:04:51,691 --> 00:04:56,296
he will understand your situation,
whatever it is.

64
00:05:58,124 --> 00:05:59,192
Are you okay?

65
00:06:01,427 --> 00:06:02,462
I'm okay.

66
00:06:03,296 --> 00:06:04,764
Are you sure?

67
00:06:06,966 --> 00:06:07,834
Yes.

68
00:06:08,701 --> 00:06:10,136
Don't mind me.

69
00:06:12,105 --> 00:06:13,740
It's just overfatigue.

70
00:06:17,443 --> 00:06:19,479
Doc, don't lie to me.

71
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:23,516
I saw you at your worse
during the earthquake.

72
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:25,752
I know it's not just because of work.

73
00:06:30,156 --> 00:06:33,326
Doctor Maxine, you are not fit
to do an operation.

74
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:35,995
Let others do it.

75
00:06:37,263 --> 00:06:38,297
I'll do it.

76
00:06:39,499 --> 00:06:40,900
You should rest, Doc Maxine.

77
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:45,705
Are you his attending doctor?

78
00:06:45,772 --> 00:06:48,107
Where is your patient?
Let me see his charts.

79
00:06:48,174 --> 00:06:50,643
You are not in the camp.
Do not make demands.

80
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:52,512
I'm not here to fight.

81
00:06:52,578 --> 00:06:56,115
We may have unresolved issues,
but that's not what I came here for.

82
00:06:56,182 --> 00:06:57,750
I came here for your patient.

83
00:06:57,817 --> 00:07:00,987
If I knew where he was,
I would have told you earlier

84
00:07:01,053 --> 00:07:02,789
so we don't even have to talk.

85
00:07:04,357 --> 00:07:06,359
I know we are not close.

86
00:07:06,859 --> 00:07:10,196
We have differences in the past, but…

87
00:07:11,831 --> 00:07:13,633
you can vent out on me.

88
00:07:20,473 --> 00:07:22,475
I hate myself.

89
00:07:26,379 --> 00:07:28,448
I was so unfair to Lucas.

90
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:32,752
What made you say that?

91
00:07:35,788 --> 00:07:39,659
Moira, Lucas is doing everything for me.

92
00:07:42,595 --> 00:07:45,865
He almost gave up his life for me.

93
00:07:48,034 --> 00:07:49,268
But as for me…

94
00:07:52,872 --> 00:07:55,007
I couldn't even tell him the truth.

95
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:05,918
If there is one thing I've learned
from what happened to me and Diego…

96
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:12,091
it is that nothing good comes out
from not telling the truth.

97
00:08:14,227 --> 00:08:15,595
What will I do?

98
00:08:16,028 --> 00:08:17,763
How do I…

99
00:08:18,531 --> 00:08:20,166
What if…

100
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:26,105
What if he gets angry
and can't accept the truth?

101
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:27,507
What will I do?

102
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:31,410
He will get hurt, Doc Maxine.

103
00:08:32,712 --> 00:08:35,581
He will get hurt
because you didn't tell the truth.

104
00:08:35,648 --> 00:08:38,618
If you want a lasting relationship…

105
00:08:39,552 --> 00:08:42,021
you should start
with a foundation of trust.

106
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:45,958
Do not let your relationship get destroyed

107
00:08:47,393 --> 00:08:49,629
and end up like me and Diego.

108
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:17,390
He just woke up
after being in a coma for several days.

109
00:09:17,456 --> 00:09:18,958
It is safe to talk to him.

110
00:09:19,025 --> 00:09:21,327
He already tested negative for the virus.

111
00:09:22,261 --> 00:09:23,262
Thank you.

112
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:34,607
I'm begging you.

113
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:39,245
The PRG will kill my family
once they find out where I am.

114
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:51,324
Listen to me.

115
00:09:52,191 --> 00:09:53,326
I will help.

116
00:09:55,962 --> 00:09:58,731
But you have to help me, too.

117
00:10:00,533 --> 00:10:01,534
Do you understand?

118
00:10:02,935 --> 00:10:04,070
How?

119
00:10:04,971 --> 00:10:10,076
You will tell me where the PRG camp is.

120
00:10:11,877 --> 00:10:14,914
We searched everywhere.

121
00:10:15,848 --> 00:10:22,021
In San Vicente, Talisay and Sitio Verde.

122
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:26,258
But we know there is another camp.

123
00:10:27,493 --> 00:10:32,264
Now, you will tell us where this camp is.

124
00:10:32,331 --> 00:10:33,866
I can't tell you.

125
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:38,104
The PRG will hurt me.

126
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:41,874
They might kill my family.

127
00:10:42,675 --> 00:10:46,145
Dong, I promise you.

128
00:10:47,246 --> 00:10:51,384
They can't hurt your family
because I will protect you.

129
00:10:52,284 --> 00:10:53,586
We will protect you.

130
00:10:55,187 --> 00:10:57,490
We will not let that happen
to your family.

131
00:10:58,824 --> 00:11:03,062
So, tell me where the camp is.

132
00:11:04,296 --> 00:11:07,466
Don't worry I am on your side.

133
00:11:07,533 --> 00:11:09,235
We are on your side.

134
00:11:10,436 --> 00:11:11,904
We won't put you in danger.

135
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:16,008
Okay, I'll tell you.

136
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:19,578
We have another camp
that you don't know about.

137
00:11:20,446 --> 00:11:22,548
My comrades are most likely still there.

138
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:25,117
Where?

139
00:11:25,718 --> 00:11:27,486
It's by the river.

140
00:11:48,808 --> 00:11:51,911
Nurse Hazel, have you seen Lucas?

141
00:11:51,977 --> 00:11:53,045
No, Doc.

142
00:11:55,281 --> 00:11:58,150
I will tell him the truth
about my brother.

143
00:11:59,485 --> 00:12:00,619
Really, Doc?

144
00:12:03,923 --> 00:12:07,893
I don't want to lie to him
and I don't want to hide anything.

145
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:21,006
Have you seen Lucas?

146
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:22,942
Yes. We left him inside.

147
00:12:24,477 --> 00:12:25,711
What is he doing?

148
00:12:26,178 --> 00:12:29,014
The young rebel just woke up.

149
00:12:31,484 --> 00:12:34,887
Are they talking?
What are they talking about?

150
00:12:36,722 --> 00:12:39,692
<i>He left. He was in such a hurry.</i>

151
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:46,031
-Where is the coffee? Let's go.
-It's here.

152
00:12:46,832 --> 00:12:47,900
Okay.

153
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:55,808
Doc, maybe it has something to do
with your brother.

154
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:01,480
He is Bullet, the notorious leader of PRG.

155
00:13:01,547 --> 00:13:03,382
Is he the one who crippled your father?

156
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:05,184
He almost killed him.

157
00:13:05,251 --> 00:13:07,753
Because of what he did,
our lives turned upside down.

158
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:10,256
I promised my father…

159
00:13:11,357 --> 00:13:14,960
I would do everything
to capture this person.

160
00:13:25,704 --> 00:13:28,808
We will attack the day after tomorrow.

161
00:13:29,508 --> 00:13:32,511
You have to prepare our comrades.

162
00:13:33,846 --> 00:13:36,015
We need to plan carefully what to do.

163
00:13:52,765 --> 00:13:53,833
Where is Moira?

164
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:57,503
I've been looking for her.
I need to talk to talk to her.

165
00:13:57,570 --> 00:13:59,939
I heard her talking to her dad.

166
00:14:00,005 --> 00:14:02,608
They are talking
about Doc Moira's reassignment.

167
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:05,411
What? Reassignment?

168
00:14:05,811 --> 00:14:06,745
Yes.

169
00:14:06,812 --> 00:14:08,380
She is leaving Urdan.

170
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:10,316
What?

171
00:14:13,452 --> 00:14:15,254
Sir Diego, where are you going?

172
00:14:26,131 --> 00:14:28,167
Why didn't you tell me
that you are leaving?

173
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:31,837
What are you doing?

174
00:14:34,106 --> 00:14:36,075
Why leave all of a sudden?

175
00:14:37,309 --> 00:14:38,510
When is your departure?

176
00:14:40,312 --> 00:14:41,881
Why do I have to tell you?

177
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:47,620
How about your patients
and your colleagues here?

178
00:14:47,686 --> 00:14:49,154
They need you.

179
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:51,223
I have turned over everything to Maxine.

180
00:14:58,864 --> 00:15:00,799
Captain Moira Defensor!

181
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:02,835
Don't leave.

182
00:15:10,609 --> 00:15:12,778
Let me remind you that I am your superior.

183
00:15:12,845 --> 00:15:16,081
My rank is higher than yours,
Technical Sergeant Diego Ramos.

184
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:25,858
Yes.

185
00:15:27,559 --> 00:15:29,528
Your rank is higher.

186
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:32,164
But I think…

187
00:15:33,832 --> 00:15:35,134
we are just equals.

188
00:15:37,536 --> 00:15:38,971
What do you mean?

189
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:54,420
When it comes to love,
there is no higher or lower rank.

190
00:15:56,555 --> 00:15:58,590
We are all equals.

191
00:16:04,763 --> 00:16:06,165
What is it again, Diego?

192
00:16:06,932 --> 00:16:10,436
You will lead me on
and then break up with me again.

193
00:16:11,437 --> 00:16:12,871
I can't take it anymore.

194
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:18,744
No, Moira.

195
00:17:47,499 --> 00:17:49,701
You think Lucas can still save you.

196
00:17:50,269 --> 00:17:52,538
<i>As long as I'm alive,
he can't get you from me.</i>

197
00:17:52,604 --> 00:17:53,906
<i>Do you understand?</i>

198
00:18:25,637 --> 00:18:27,306
What is it again, Talledo?

199
00:18:28,006 --> 00:18:29,007
I'm sorry.

200
00:18:29,641 --> 00:18:32,644
It's Big Boss.
He's not responding to our calls.

201
00:18:32,711 --> 00:18:34,480
Col. Garcia is looking for him.

202
00:18:35,414 --> 00:18:38,083
What? Where did he go?

203
00:18:49,228 --> 00:18:50,195
<i>Answer me!</i>

204
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:07,045
You will pay for everything you've done.

205
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:12,951
You think you got me?

206
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:06,538
This is your end.

207
00:20:12,744 --> 00:20:14,179
Don't kill him!

208
00:20:16,448 --> 00:20:17,516
He is my brother.

209
00:20:36,702 --> 00:20:37,769
What do you mean?

210
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:40,272
Maxine, this is Bullet!

211
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:44,543
He is also Rodel dela Cruz.

212
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:47,045
My long-lost brother.

213
00:20:56,288 --> 00:20:57,756
He is my older brother, Rodel.

214
00:20:57,823 --> 00:21:00,559
So please, Lucas. Don't kill him.

215
00:21:10,068 --> 00:21:11,770
Listen to your girlfriend.

216
00:21:20,812 --> 00:21:22,581
-Brother!
-This is your end.

217
00:21:25,984 --> 00:21:26,852
Brother!

218
00:21:28,153 --> 00:21:30,555
-Maxine, step aside.
-Maxine, what are you doing?

219
00:21:31,523 --> 00:21:32,424
Enough!

220
00:21:36,628 --> 00:21:38,864
Brother, stop it! What's wrong with you?

221
00:21:40,032 --> 00:21:42,067
I won't let you hurt Lucas.

222
00:21:42,768 --> 00:21:45,637
You will really choose that soldier
over your brother?

223
00:21:46,838 --> 00:21:49,941
I don't want any of you to get hurt.

224
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:55,714
Brother, just let us leave. We're leaving.

225
00:21:55,781 --> 00:21:57,649
You can't.

226
00:21:57,716 --> 00:22:00,619
You saw earlier
that he wanted to kill me, right?

227
00:22:00,686 --> 00:22:02,020
But he didn't do it.

228
00:22:02,087 --> 00:22:03,955
Well, that's his fault.

229
00:22:04,756 --> 00:22:07,359
Lucas Manalo owes me big time.

230
00:22:08,827 --> 00:22:12,964
Maxine, he came here defenseless
and with no backup.

231
00:22:13,031 --> 00:22:16,168
-So it's my chance to kill him.
-Brother!

232
00:22:20,639 --> 00:22:24,209
<i>All units, this is Snoopy.
We're looking for Doc Maxine.</i>

233
00:22:28,246 --> 00:22:29,748
They are not in the Medicube.

234
00:22:30,415 --> 00:22:32,351
They are not also in the barracks.

235
00:22:33,819 --> 00:22:37,022
Doc Maxine and Big Boss
are both missing.

236
00:22:37,089 --> 00:22:39,024
Maybe they went out on a date.

237
00:22:41,093 --> 00:22:44,796
They would not leave without permission
if it's just a date.

238
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:47,866
I have a bad feeling.

239
00:22:47,933 --> 00:22:49,134
It's Doc Maxine.

240
00:22:49,668 --> 00:22:50,769
What?

241
00:22:59,611 --> 00:23:01,947
Let him go or I'll be forced to hurt you.

242
00:23:02,013 --> 00:23:04,649
Go ahead. Go ahead and hurt me!

243
00:23:06,885 --> 00:23:08,353
You already did, remember?

244
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:10,989
You held your own sister hostage.

245
00:23:13,458 --> 00:23:15,093
Rodel, I trusted you.

246
00:23:16,728 --> 00:23:21,032
Maxine, in the world where I am right now,
the end justifies the means.

247
00:23:21,099 --> 00:23:23,301
You can even ask your boyfriend.

248
00:23:23,368 --> 00:23:25,804
He will do everything
to accomplish his mission.

249
00:23:30,041 --> 00:23:31,410
Have you forgotten?

250
00:23:32,577 --> 00:23:36,782
He killed Janet and my child
to defeat the PRG.

251
00:23:37,482 --> 00:23:38,550
That's not true.

252
00:23:39,885 --> 00:23:43,054
I would never hurt women
especially those who are pregnant.

253
00:23:44,289 --> 00:23:45,457
I know Janet.

254
00:23:46,158 --> 00:23:48,493
I know her because she was our patient
in the Medicube.

255
00:23:49,227 --> 00:23:52,264
The truth is, we were helping Janet.

256
00:23:52,330 --> 00:23:53,698
-Liar!
-That's the truth.

257
00:23:53,765 --> 00:23:54,766
No!

258
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:57,736
Lucas is not lying.

259
00:23:59,104 --> 00:24:01,573
We took care of Janet and her baby.

260
00:24:02,541 --> 00:24:05,177
We can take care of you here
in the hospital.

261
00:24:05,243 --> 00:24:09,848
But you need to stay
so we can monitor your vitals

262
00:24:09,915 --> 00:24:11,516
and the condition of your child.

263
00:24:13,251 --> 00:24:16,087
You should take care of yourself
for your baby.

264
00:24:16,588 --> 00:24:19,191
I had the entire Medicube checked
before I called you.

265
00:24:19,257 --> 00:24:20,459
But she's really gone.

266
00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:24,396
You should come with us.

267
00:24:25,263 --> 00:24:29,267
Your pregnancy is already complicated
and it's not safe if you give birth here.

268
00:24:29,935 --> 00:24:32,070
Do you want your child to grow up
in this kind of place?

269
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:34,105
I know you want to save us.

270
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:38,643
But this is your chance to save yourself,
especially your baby.

271
00:24:44,683 --> 00:24:46,184
Don't blame Lucas.

272
00:24:48,086 --> 00:24:49,754
Don't blame him
for something he didn't do.

273
00:24:49,821 --> 00:24:51,122
Shut up!

274
00:24:55,727 --> 00:24:59,931
You know, Maxine,
you are blinded by your love for that man.

275
00:24:59,998 --> 00:25:02,801
-That's why he deserves to die!
-Brother!

276
00:25:25,323 --> 00:25:29,160
<i>Oh, my God, Maxine. Your brother is alive?</i>

277
00:25:29,227 --> 00:25:33,164
I told you, let's not lose hope.

278
00:25:33,231 --> 00:25:35,066
<i>I want to see Rodel.</i>

279
00:25:35,133 --> 00:25:38,169
I'm sorry,
but the reunion you want will not happen.

280
00:25:39,404 --> 00:25:40,438
I love you, my child.

281
00:25:40,505 --> 00:25:45,477
And I will do anything to make you happy
even if that means I will leave you here.

282
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:48,146
Tell me why you went to the PRG camp.

283
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:50,382
I already told you the reason, Colonel.

284
00:25:50,448 --> 00:25:51,983
I don't believe you.

285
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:54,553
The PRG took you twice already, right?

286
00:25:54,619 --> 00:25:57,355
But why does it seems like
you are still willing to go back there?

287
00:25:57,422 --> 00:25:59,257
Why are they always calling on you?

288
00:25:59,991 --> 00:26:03,862
I didn't know that the Doctor is a VIP.
Find out when she's leaving.

289
00:26:03,929 --> 00:26:07,766
We're on our way out of Barangay Maligaya.
We'll be in the airport in ten minutes.
