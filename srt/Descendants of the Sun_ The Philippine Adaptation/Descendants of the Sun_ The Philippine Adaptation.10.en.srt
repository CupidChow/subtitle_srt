1
00:00:11,277 --> 00:00:13,947
<i>That Lucas is such a jerk.</i>

2
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:16,216
He's so arrogant and proud.

3
00:00:16,282 --> 00:00:17,984
I just have to bear it
a little bit longer.

4
00:00:18,051 --> 00:00:19,452
<i>I'm going back to Manila next week.</i>

5
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:21,154
<i>He thinks only he can play a prank?</i>

6
00:00:21,221 --> 00:00:22,055
We'll see about that.

7
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:23,957
Does it have to be that big?

8
00:00:24,524 --> 00:00:26,226
It's not that painful, right?

9
00:00:26,292 --> 00:00:27,227
No.

10
00:00:27,627 --> 00:00:29,129
<i>Is there no water supply?</i>

11
00:00:29,195 --> 00:00:30,430
The pipeline is damaged.

12
00:00:30,497 --> 00:00:32,399
<i>Where can I fetch water?</i>

13
00:00:32,465 --> 00:00:33,733
<i>By the water tank.</i>

14
00:00:36,603 --> 00:00:39,072
That is our target, Sitio Santo Domingo.

15
00:00:39,139 --> 00:00:41,374
<i>It's a hot spot of terrorist activities.</i>

16
00:00:42,442 --> 00:00:46,179
I'm not scared to fight those soldiers,
but we're having a baby soon.

17
00:00:46,246 --> 00:00:48,081
<i>What if something bad happens to our baby?</i>

18
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:51,618
<i>Let's just surrender</i>
<i>while we still have time, please.</i>

19
00:00:52,085 --> 00:00:54,788
Are you and Captain Lucas
still fighting, Doc?

20
00:00:54,854 --> 00:00:56,122
He started it.

21
00:00:56,189 --> 00:00:57,690
You both seem to be enjoying it.

22
00:00:57,757 --> 00:01:01,261
Maybe because you always bicker
when you see each other.

23
00:01:01,327 --> 00:01:03,863
<i>Whatever. I'm still mad at him.</i>

24
00:01:31,791 --> 00:01:32,959
-Captain.
-Governor.

25
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:39,632
Urdan has changed a lot
from the last time I was here.

26
00:01:42,235 --> 00:01:44,671
This town is slowly recovering.

27
00:01:46,673 --> 00:01:50,977
Kudos also to the medical team
for rehabilitating this place.

28
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:54,881
Nothing is impossible
as long as we help each other.

29
00:01:57,784 --> 00:01:59,319
Thank you very much, Governor.

30
00:01:59,819 --> 00:02:04,390
Your military vehicle is here.
We can start the site visit.

31
00:02:07,193 --> 00:02:08,194
You can sit in front.

32
00:02:38,525 --> 00:02:39,559
The tire exploded.

33
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:44,464
A tire?

34
00:02:45,098 --> 00:02:46,166
The tire just exploded.

35
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:51,171
Are you okay, Governor?

36
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:56,276
-Are you okay? Can you stand?
-Yes.

37
00:02:57,477 --> 00:02:58,411
A tire?

38
00:02:58,478 --> 00:02:59,679
What happened to you?

39
00:03:02,115 --> 00:03:04,384
Looks like it was cut with a knife.

40
00:03:05,218 --> 00:03:06,686
Like it was done intentionally.

41
00:03:08,154 --> 00:03:09,122
What?

42
00:03:42,822 --> 00:03:44,691
Are you okay? Can you still join us?

43
00:03:51,164 --> 00:03:52,298
This is nothing.

44
00:03:54,434 --> 00:03:55,702
The governor is more important.

45
00:03:58,171 --> 00:03:59,606
You need help?

46
00:04:01,808 --> 00:04:02,675
Go ahead.

47
00:04:27,033 --> 00:04:28,167
Oh, no.

48
00:04:28,234 --> 00:04:30,803
Won't Capt. Lucas's foot get swollen?

49
00:04:31,804 --> 00:04:35,475
He fell hard.
I'm sure he sprained his foot.

50
00:04:35,541 --> 00:04:37,777
You're overreacting, Via.

51
00:04:37,844 --> 00:04:40,079
He tripped
and you already think it's a sprain?

52
00:04:40,146 --> 00:04:41,047
No, it's not.

53
00:04:41,547 --> 00:04:43,216
I hope his foot won't get swollen.

54
00:04:59,032 --> 00:05:01,334
Liniment… for your foot.

55
00:05:01,934 --> 00:05:04,937
I saw what happened to you earlier.

56
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:18,184
I also brought some medicine.

57
00:05:21,054 --> 00:05:21,921
Here.

58
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:25,892
Take this three times a day after meals
to help with the swelling.

59
00:05:25,958 --> 00:05:27,393
I don't need that.

60
00:05:28,361 --> 00:05:30,863
I endured a gunshot wound, why not this?

61
00:05:31,464 --> 00:05:32,932
It's just a sprain.

62
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:36,836
-This can help.
-It's okay.

63
00:05:36,903 --> 00:05:38,204
It's all good. You can go.

64
00:05:39,138 --> 00:05:40,006
I can handle this.

65
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:42,342
I'm sorry. It's all my fault.

66
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:46,245
I didn't know it would turn out like this.

67
00:05:46,779 --> 00:05:49,749
I didn't want this to happen to you.

68
00:05:49,816 --> 00:05:50,750
I'm sorry.

69
00:05:56,022 --> 00:06:00,026
I'm in charge of your safety
in this camp, okay?

70
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,495
What if I fractured my leg?

71
00:06:03,563 --> 00:06:05,131
How can I protect you?

72
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:07,800
I said I'm sorry. I admit it's my fault.

73
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:12,271
I'm sorry. You pissed me off
so I ruined your boots.

74
00:06:13,339 --> 00:06:15,608
But of course,
I didn't want you to get hurt.

75
00:06:15,675 --> 00:06:17,210
Really?

76
00:06:17,276 --> 00:06:18,378
It's true.

77
00:06:21,781 --> 00:06:23,182
What did you use to cut it?

78
00:06:29,255 --> 00:06:30,123
I'm sorry too.

79
00:06:31,924 --> 00:06:35,528
I'm sorry I scared you with the landmine…

80
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:39,265
and what I did with the water tank.

81
00:06:39,332 --> 00:06:40,366
It was you.

82
00:06:42,702 --> 00:06:44,003
I made you look foolish.

83
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:49,509
I'm also sorry for what I did.

84
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:57,483
I'm sorry too
for not telling you that I'm a soldier.

85
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:04,157
I really wanted to have more time
to get to know you.

86
00:07:06,058 --> 00:07:10,062
But I promise,
that's the last time I'll be lying to you.

87
00:07:11,631 --> 00:07:12,465
You really promise?

88
00:07:13,699 --> 00:07:15,735
I'm sorry too because…

89
00:07:16,702 --> 00:07:19,839
I was quick to judge you
because of what you did.

90
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:38,958
Are we good now?

91
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:46,299
Use that, okay.

92
00:07:46,365 --> 00:07:47,233
For the swelling?

93
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:48,768
I already have a ticket to Manila.

94
00:07:49,936 --> 00:07:51,537
My flight is tomorrow afternoon.

95
00:07:52,071 --> 00:07:53,172
You're going back to Manila?

96
00:07:58,611 --> 00:08:00,112
Only one flight a week, remember?

97
00:08:00,179 --> 00:08:03,549
If I don't catch that flight,
I won't get to leave anytime soon.

98
00:08:03,616 --> 00:08:04,851
I'll end up staying here longer.

99
00:08:04,917 --> 00:08:07,753
A lot of people need me in Manila.

100
00:08:08,387 --> 00:08:10,156
I have a lot of patients waiting for me.

101
00:08:16,462 --> 00:08:17,463
Put this on.

102
00:08:18,865 --> 00:08:20,566
There.

103
00:08:20,633 --> 00:08:21,634
Here's the medicine.

104
00:08:29,075 --> 00:08:33,045
It's getting late. I'll be heading back.
I'll get some rest.

105
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,249
-Don't forget your medicine.
-Okay.

106
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:39,685
-It will reduce the swelling.
-Thank you, Doc.

107
00:08:40,286 --> 00:08:41,420
All right, good night.

108
00:08:43,055 --> 00:08:44,056
Bye.

109
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:56,102
Have a safe flight, Doctor.

110
00:08:56,569 --> 00:08:59,405
Give my regards
to the nurses back in Manila.

111
00:09:00,339 --> 00:09:01,340
I'll let them know.

112
00:09:01,974 --> 00:09:03,109
See you in five months.

113
00:09:03,809 --> 00:09:04,911
See you.

114
00:09:07,146 --> 00:09:08,147
Doctor Maxine is there.

115
00:09:10,283 --> 00:09:11,584
She's over there.

116
00:09:11,651 --> 00:09:14,887
Did I gain some weight, Doc?
I'm not skinny anymore?

117
00:09:15,621 --> 00:09:18,491
She's asking if she's not thin anymore
and has gained weight.

118
00:09:19,191 --> 00:09:20,293
Not anymore.

119
00:09:20,359 --> 00:09:21,594
You're healthy now.

120
00:09:21,661 --> 00:09:23,429
You're doing okay.

121
00:09:27,533 --> 00:09:30,703
Our neighbors
are also doing better now, Doc.

122
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:35,308
They don't have coughs or fever anymore.
Thank you so much, Doc.

123
00:09:36,008 --> 00:09:39,111
Thank you so much, Doc.
I hope you can help more people.

124
00:09:39,178 --> 00:09:41,514
You're welcome.

125
00:09:42,448 --> 00:09:43,716
-Take care.
-Goodbye.

126
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:05,171
Doc Max, we have to go.
You might miss your flight.

127
00:10:05,237 --> 00:10:09,041
-Bye, I'm going.
-Take care.

128
00:10:11,777 --> 00:10:14,013
-Goodbye.
-Bye, Doc.

129
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,781
-Goodbye, everyone.
-Goodbye, Doc.

130
00:10:16,349 --> 00:10:20,620
-Thank you.
-Take care!

131
00:10:31,998 --> 00:10:33,733
-Bye.
-Bye, Doc!

132
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:34,867
Be safe!

133
00:10:38,671 --> 00:10:40,573
-Bye, Doc.
-Bye-bye.

134
00:10:41,374 --> 00:10:42,308
Take care, Doc.

135
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:45,411
-Come on.
-Let's go.

136
00:10:46,012 --> 00:10:47,513
Let's go.

137
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:49,815
Those who need anything checked,
you may still consult us.

138
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:02,795
Sheila, Biboy!

139
00:11:02,862 --> 00:11:05,331
Why didn't you come to see Dr. Maxine?

140
00:11:05,931 --> 00:11:07,133
Why?

141
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:08,834
What's going on?

142
00:11:08,901 --> 00:11:11,437
Dr. Maxine is leaving today.
She's going back to Manila.

143
00:11:12,204 --> 00:11:15,341
We went there to say thank you.

144
00:11:15,908 --> 00:11:17,309
Is that so?

145
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:21,280
We didn't know she was leaving today.

146
00:11:22,915 --> 00:11:25,251
Ging-ging, is Dr. Maxine still there?

147
00:11:25,317 --> 00:11:28,888
Dr. Maxine has already left
for Manila, Biboy.

148
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:31,957
Biboy!

149
00:11:32,792 --> 00:11:34,126
Oh, my…

150
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:35,561
Biboy!

151
00:11:37,229 --> 00:11:38,230
Thank you.

152
00:12:47,032 --> 00:12:48,067
Lucas!

153
00:14:13,185 --> 00:14:15,454
I realized that I'm needed here more.

154
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:22,688
All right.

155
00:15:23,689 --> 00:15:25,457
All her vitals are normal, right?

156
00:15:26,392 --> 00:15:27,393
Yes, Doc.

157
00:15:28,227 --> 00:15:29,895
Excuse us. We'll get back to you.

158
00:15:36,669 --> 00:15:37,503
Doc.

159
00:15:38,203 --> 00:15:44,009
I knew that you'd come back.
You can't bear to leave the patients here.

160
00:15:44,877 --> 00:15:46,679
Is it really just the patients?

161
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:48,914
Focus, please.

162
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:06,231
Stop it.

163
00:16:20,546 --> 00:16:21,380
Big Boss…

164
00:16:21,947 --> 00:16:23,449
the explosion is near the camp.

165
00:16:30,055 --> 00:16:31,323
You guys be careful.

166
00:18:29,741 --> 00:18:30,576
Doc…

167
00:18:31,577 --> 00:18:32,644
On his side, please.

168
00:18:34,246 --> 00:18:36,448
-Doc.
-Please monitor his vitals.

169
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:40,719
-Please connect the oxygen,
-Let me. I know how to do it.

170
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:49,294
How long has he been having seizures?

171
00:18:49,361 --> 00:18:50,662
Around five minutes.

172
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:53,065
He'd already collapsed when I saw him.

173
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:54,867
-Did he hit his head?
-I don't know.

174
00:18:54,933 --> 00:18:56,068
-Did he vomit?
-No.

175
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:58,203
Please connect the access, please.

176
00:18:58,270 --> 00:18:59,671
It's 90/60, Doc.

177
00:19:01,406 --> 00:19:02,541
Please push diastat.

178
00:19:04,543 --> 00:19:05,811
Done, Doc.

179
00:19:08,447 --> 00:19:10,516
Biboy.

180
00:19:14,286 --> 00:19:15,387
Biboy.

181
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:17,723
Biboy.

182
00:19:19,591 --> 00:19:21,226
Biboy.

183
00:19:25,898 --> 00:19:27,266
Biboy is okay now.

184
00:19:31,069 --> 00:19:32,271
Doc.

185
00:19:49,454 --> 00:19:51,823
It looks like those terrorists
have been trained well.

186
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:54,493
Did you see how they moved?
Everything is calculated.

187
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:56,795
I wonder who their leader is?

188
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:59,631
Your question could've been answered
if I'd caught one of them earlier.

189
00:20:00,465 --> 00:20:04,069
I would have avenged
what those animals did to my father.

190
00:20:05,003 --> 00:20:09,007
We almost failed, idiots!
One of you is not telling the truth.

191
00:20:10,075 --> 00:20:12,811
First, they discovered
where our training headquarters is.

192
00:20:13,412 --> 00:20:16,014
Second, the ambulance we were in exploded.

193
00:20:17,182 --> 00:20:19,084
Someone is sabotaging the PRG.

194
00:20:20,519 --> 00:20:22,087
There is a traitor in the group.

195
00:20:22,821 --> 00:20:23,956
<i>I also want to know…</i>

196
00:20:24,623 --> 00:20:27,993
who supplies their guns,
bombs, and ammunition?

197
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:29,261
It only means one thing.

198
00:20:29,328 --> 00:20:32,231
They are strengthening their force
here in Urdan.

199
00:20:32,297 --> 00:20:34,199
Now tell me, who is the traitor?

200
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,168
There's no one. It's not me.

201
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:38,971
It's also not me.
I'm an ally, not an enemy.

202
00:20:40,706 --> 00:20:42,241
Nobody wants to admit it?

203
00:20:42,774 --> 00:20:44,643
Nobody wants to speak up?

204
00:20:50,716 --> 00:20:53,919
Let's be more vigilant
because they can attack us at any time.

205
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:02,327
Don't you dare betray the PRG.

206
00:21:03,228 --> 00:21:05,897
I will kill whoever betrays the group!

207
00:21:11,436 --> 00:21:13,839
Good thing he didn't hit his head.

208
00:21:15,674 --> 00:21:16,908
Dr. Maxine…

209
00:21:17,909 --> 00:21:22,414
thank you so much for saving my son.

210
00:21:24,549 --> 00:21:26,551
Thank God for your…

211
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:28,687
for your help.

212
00:21:29,621 --> 00:21:30,689
Don't worry about it.

213
00:21:43,468 --> 00:21:44,870
Biboy…

214
00:21:45,537 --> 00:21:46,538
Mom…

215
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:49,741
Doc Maxine…

216
00:21:51,543 --> 00:21:53,078
How are you, Biboy?

217
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:54,413
I'm doing fine.

218
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:56,348
Because you treated me already.

219
00:21:57,049 --> 00:21:58,050
Thank you.

220
00:21:58,850 --> 00:22:01,353
You should thank God, okay?

221
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:04,222
Because nothing bad happened to you.

222
00:22:05,424 --> 00:22:06,725
Captain Lucas said…

223
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:09,127
you were caught in the crossfire?

224
00:22:09,194 --> 00:22:10,362
I was.

225
00:22:11,963 --> 00:22:15,834
I ran here so I could catch you.

226
00:22:16,401 --> 00:22:20,405
My friend told me that you were leaving.

227
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:22,074
Doc Maxine…

228
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:24,109
we need you here.

229
00:22:29,047 --> 00:22:30,382
You don't have to worry.

230
00:22:30,449 --> 00:22:31,917
I'm not leaving anymore.

231
00:22:31,983 --> 00:22:33,085
Really?

232
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:37,522
Doc Beauty is not leaving anymore.

233
00:22:50,802 --> 00:22:53,338
Wow, Doc Maxine. Is it your birthday?

234
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:56,975
No, my birthday is over.

235
00:22:57,042 --> 00:23:00,545
I hope it's like this every day!
That looks delicious, like for a feast!

236
00:23:00,612 --> 00:23:01,980
Go ahead and sit down.

237
00:23:03,615 --> 00:23:04,483
Hey!

238
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:05,917
Doc Maxine!

239
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:09,087
I'm tired of eating canned goods.

240
00:23:09,654 --> 00:23:12,491
My birthday is not until next week,
but thank you, Doc Maxine.

241
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:18,363
I prepared food to celebrate
because we are all safe,

242
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:20,098
and Captain Lucas too.

243
00:23:20,165 --> 00:23:22,100
Nothing bad happened to them, so…

244
00:23:22,667 --> 00:23:23,668
Thank you, Lord.

245
00:23:24,503 --> 00:23:28,039
And tomorrow is my brother's birthday.
That's why I cooked.

246
00:23:28,106 --> 00:23:30,108
We don't have
a lot of patients today, anyway.

247
00:23:30,175 --> 00:23:31,510
You have an older brother?

248
00:23:31,576 --> 00:23:32,744
I do.

249
00:23:33,645 --> 00:23:34,913
But he's been…

250
00:23:36,748 --> 00:23:39,351
We haven't seen each other
for a long time.

251
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:44,189
But I still celebrate his birthday.

252
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:46,758
Let's serve the food.

253
00:23:46,825 --> 00:23:48,226
Go ahead and get some.

254
00:23:48,293 --> 00:23:49,594
Let me get that.

255
00:23:49,661 --> 00:23:51,363
Go ahead, let's eat.

256
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:53,198
Would you like some of this?

257
00:24:21,593 --> 00:24:23,361
Oh, Maxine.

258
00:24:23,829 --> 00:24:26,198
I'm leaving for Mindanao.
You shouldn't have bothered.

259
00:24:26,264 --> 00:24:27,199
It's a waste of money.

260
00:24:27,265 --> 00:24:30,836
Come on, Rodel. It's your birthday.

261
00:24:31,837 --> 00:24:35,907
I know when you're in the field,
your food is limited.

262
00:24:35,974 --> 00:24:38,844
So don't be too cranky
and stop complaining.

263
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:40,078
The cake's already here.

264
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:42,581
That's the thing.
If only I could stay, I wouldn't leave.

265
00:24:43,882 --> 00:24:44,983
But of course…

266
00:24:45,617 --> 00:24:49,221
I pledged to serve our country
as a soldier.

267
00:24:49,287 --> 00:24:52,357
Our country is so lucky.

268
00:24:53,725 --> 00:24:55,961
Go ahead and blow your candle.

269
00:24:56,862 --> 00:24:58,163
Make a wish first!

270
00:24:59,164 --> 00:25:00,365
Okay, all right.

271
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:08,306
Thank you.

272
00:25:13,645 --> 00:25:14,813
<i>Thank you for coming back.</i>

273
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:16,314
I thought…

274
00:25:17,949 --> 00:25:19,818
I'd lose you again.

275
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,054
I came back because…

276
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:26,558
it's my calling to help others.

277
00:25:27,692 --> 00:25:29,528
It's also my duty as a doctor.

278
00:25:31,563 --> 00:25:36,301
So whoever is in need,
I'm just here for them.

279
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:37,402
I'll be where I am needed.

280
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:40,238
And I'll go with you.

281
00:25:41,439 --> 00:25:45,143
And as a soldier,
it's my duty to protect all of you…

282
00:25:46,344 --> 00:25:47,612
and to protect you.

283
00:25:49,581 --> 00:25:51,950
So wherever you go, I'm coming with you.

284
00:25:53,752 --> 00:25:54,953
Really?

285
00:25:56,421 --> 00:25:58,657
-Do you want some?
-Finish that already.

286
00:25:58,723 --> 00:26:00,759
It's delicious! I'll eat it.

287
00:26:01,927 --> 00:26:03,061
What did you put in here?

288
00:27:00,352 --> 00:27:02,621
<i>In five days, Mr. Alif Fayad will arrive.</i>

289
00:27:02,687 --> 00:27:05,924
<i>He's coming here to give assistance</i>
<i>to the residents of Urdan.</i>

290
00:27:05,991 --> 00:27:07,425
So it means we're not invited?

291
00:27:07,492 --> 00:27:10,261
<i>Why don't you try to be brave, Maxine?</i>

292
00:27:10,328 --> 00:27:14,499
<i>For once, try to conquer</i>
<i>your abandonment issues.</i>

293
00:27:14,566 --> 00:27:18,870
What motif do you want for our wedding?
Do you want silver and gold?

294
00:27:18,937 --> 00:27:19,904
Wedding?

295
00:27:20,605 --> 00:27:22,007
You two?

296
00:27:22,073 --> 00:27:24,576
I'm just letting her vent
her anger towards me.

297
00:27:24,643 --> 00:27:25,844
When it's all gone,

298
00:27:25,910 --> 00:27:28,413
maybe she'll have no feelings
left for me either.

299
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,181
If the military has special forces,

300
00:27:30,248 --> 00:27:32,951
the PRG has an elite team,
so they better prepare.

301
00:27:33,018 --> 00:27:35,420
You're all so tensed.

302
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:37,756
Maybe your blood pressure
is always high, Captain Lucas?

303
00:27:37,822 --> 00:27:40,492
That's why we always need a doctor
by our side.

304
00:27:40,558 --> 00:27:41,393
<i>The middle car.</i>

305
00:27:42,193 --> 00:27:43,361
It's Alif Fayad.
