1
00:00:11,244 --> 00:00:13,279
Because of you, I disobeyed direct orders.

2
00:00:13,346 --> 00:00:15,548
It was because of you.
I sacrificed my career for you.

3
00:00:15,615 --> 00:00:16,583
-For me?
-Yes, for you.

4
00:00:16,649 --> 00:00:17,517
-For you!
-Did you?

5
00:00:17,584 --> 00:00:19,252
Which law is more just?

6
00:00:19,319 --> 00:00:20,887
The law of your profession?

7
00:00:20,954 --> 00:00:22,789
Blind obedience?

8
00:00:22,956 --> 00:00:26,259
Or the most important law,
which is to save the lives?

9
00:00:26,326 --> 00:00:30,330
Shouting at his superior was embarrassing.

10
00:00:30,397 --> 00:00:34,434
I was reminded of my brother.

11
00:00:34,501 --> 00:00:37,303
So, you're comparing Lucas
to your brother?

12
00:00:37,404 --> 00:00:39,205
Is he that important to you?

13
00:00:39,406 --> 00:00:40,640
Do you still like him?

14
00:00:40,707 --> 00:00:46,579
What I'd like is to stab him.
He really got on my nerves.

15
00:00:46,646 --> 00:00:49,315
I tried to do what you want.

16
00:00:49,382 --> 00:00:54,020
I tried to get mad at you
because it might be the way to forget you.

17
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:55,555
But it's not effective.

18
00:00:55,622 --> 00:00:58,992
Whatever you do,
I'll fight for what I feel for you.

19
00:00:59,192 --> 00:01:01,294
Seems like we won't really understand
each other.

20
00:01:01,361 --> 00:01:03,363
I told you, we are different.

21
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:07,000
But why do I still like you
a lot despite that?

22
00:01:10,437 --> 00:01:12,872
Doc Moira, I'll leave my team with you.

23
00:01:12,939 --> 00:01:15,942
I have a scheduled visit to Sitio Santos.

24
00:01:16,009 --> 00:01:19,379
Postpone it for now, Maxine.
You can visit when it's already safe.

25
00:01:19,712 --> 00:01:21,781
I can't. People are expecting me there.

26
00:01:21,848 --> 00:01:23,817
Don't worry, I'll go with her.

27
00:01:23,883 --> 00:01:25,018
I'm not scared.

28
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:27,787
Why do you look nervous?

29
00:01:27,854 --> 00:01:30,590
Is it because I kissed you last night?

30
00:01:30,657 --> 00:01:34,994
I tried and hesitated a thousand
before I had the guts to do it.

31
00:01:35,061 --> 00:01:39,532
I can't deny how I feel for you.

32
00:01:48,341 --> 00:01:52,312
Just put your fingers on your other palm.

33
00:01:52,378 --> 00:01:55,582
Then you move it in circles,
just like that…

34
00:01:55,648 --> 00:01:57,851
so you can take out the dirt
in your fingernails.

35
00:01:58,818 --> 00:02:00,286
Then, the other hand.

36
00:02:00,353 --> 00:02:02,755
Rinse your hands properly.

37
00:02:03,823 --> 00:02:05,592
Wash them thoroughly.

38
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:07,794
Are there no suds left?

39
00:02:09,095 --> 00:02:12,999
Later we'll wipe them with a clean towel.

40
00:02:15,068 --> 00:02:20,406
After this, I'll teach you to brush
your teeth properly.

41
00:02:22,375 --> 00:02:23,510
It still has suds.

42
00:02:24,878 --> 00:02:26,346
After washing your hands,

43
00:02:26,412 --> 00:02:28,481
the doctor will teach you
how to brush your teeth

44
00:02:28,581 --> 00:02:31,117
so your teeth won't fall off.

45
00:02:33,286 --> 00:02:35,054
What did you tell them?

46
00:02:37,056 --> 00:02:39,025
I just translated what you said, ma'am.

47
00:02:40,693 --> 00:02:42,128
Then, why are they laughing?

48
00:02:43,396 --> 00:02:44,364
I don't know, ma'am

49
00:02:53,139 --> 00:02:54,007
-Captain.
-Yes?

50
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:57,043
Do you like Doc Beauty?

51
00:02:59,279 --> 00:03:02,415
Why? Is it too obvious?

52
00:03:06,052 --> 00:03:07,754
Don't get angry, Biboy.

53
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:10,690
I don't stand a chance with Doc Beauty.

54
00:03:14,727 --> 00:03:16,529
We should take you to the love tree.

55
00:03:16,596 --> 00:03:18,097
Love tree?

56
00:03:18,298 --> 00:03:21,401
You should carve you name
so you will end up together!

57
00:03:27,607 --> 00:03:28,942
Where? Where is the love tree?

58
00:03:29,008 --> 00:03:31,344
Lucas, where are you going?

59
00:03:31,411 --> 00:03:32,912
We're not yet done!

60
00:03:48,962 --> 00:03:51,731
Are you sure about this, Biboy?
Maybe you're just playing jokes on me.

61
00:03:51,798 --> 00:03:54,934
There. Sheila loves Norman.

62
00:03:55,001 --> 00:03:56,436
Those are my parents' initials.

63
00:03:56,502 --> 00:03:59,038
They ended up together
because of the love tree.

64
00:04:09,616 --> 00:04:11,718
Is it okay with you?

65
00:04:12,151 --> 00:04:14,454
I thought you're going to court
Doc Beauty when you grow up.

66
00:04:16,456 --> 00:04:17,290
Lucas!

67
00:04:20,226 --> 00:04:21,461
What are you doing here?

68
00:04:22,462 --> 00:04:23,930
Doc Beauty…

69
00:04:24,063 --> 00:04:28,067
I can no longer make you wait
because you might get sad.

70
00:04:28,134 --> 00:04:29,702
It will take some time before I grow up.

71
00:04:31,204 --> 00:04:32,338
Biboy?

72
00:04:32,872 --> 00:04:35,575
It's okay with me if the Captain
becomes your boyfriend.

73
00:04:40,913 --> 00:04:42,148
Did you make Biboy say that?

74
00:04:42,715 --> 00:04:45,251
Of course not. I am shocked too.

75
00:04:45,318 --> 00:04:46,452
He's mature.

76
00:04:48,421 --> 00:04:50,790
Come on, Doc Beauty, say yes to Cap.

77
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:32,925
Kids, it's time to go home.

78
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,395
Go.

79
00:06:41,434 --> 00:06:42,268
Just relax.

80
00:06:43,836 --> 00:06:47,039
Don't worry, next time,
I won't steal a kiss from you.

81
00:06:47,673 --> 00:06:49,108
And I won't surprise you,

82
00:06:50,943 --> 00:06:52,345
'cause we'll be officially together.

83
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:55,214
Wow.

84
00:06:56,282 --> 00:06:57,784
Your confidence blows me away.

85
00:07:24,477 --> 00:07:26,312
He's almost done taking a bath.

86
00:07:27,346 --> 00:07:28,414
Yes, he already ate.

87
00:07:28,481 --> 00:07:32,585
One cup of rice,
a cup of pork soup, and a slice of fish.

88
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:34,821
Did you make him take his medicine?

89
00:07:34,887 --> 00:07:35,788
<i>Of course, ma'am.</i>

90
00:07:35,855 --> 00:07:39,192
<i>I'm following all your orders</i>

91
00:07:39,258 --> 00:07:42,061
even if it's difficult to make
Master Ramos take his medicines.

92
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:43,830
You know he's a bit grouchy.

93
00:07:43,896 --> 00:07:45,465
Just be patient with him.

94
00:07:45,531 --> 00:07:47,967
Yes, that's what I'm doing.

95
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:55,308
Sir!

96
00:07:56,342 --> 00:07:57,310
Hello, Marty?

97
00:07:57,877 --> 00:07:59,512
Ma'am, abort mission.

98
00:08:00,613 --> 00:08:03,115
You mean, failed mission.
You better end that call.

99
00:08:03,816 --> 00:08:05,451
Who should you take orders from?

100
00:08:05,518 --> 00:08:07,920
But she is a captain.

101
00:08:10,456 --> 00:08:11,958
It looks like he's doing fine already.

102
00:08:12,725 --> 00:08:14,093
Okay, bye.

103
00:08:15,628 --> 00:08:18,498
Ma'am… Ma'am, help me, please. Ma'am?

104
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:29,876
Any more complaints?

105
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:55,134
-Janet, are you okay?
-Yes.

106
00:08:56,602 --> 00:09:00,306
My back is a bit sore,
maybe from the bending.

107
00:09:01,073 --> 00:09:03,109
I'll go to the town proper later.

108
00:09:03,242 --> 00:09:05,645
I'll buy some medicine for your wound.

109
00:09:05,778 --> 00:09:07,046
Shouldn't you rest?

110
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:09,248
Maybe our baby is tired too.

111
00:09:09,415 --> 00:09:11,117
Greg will take care of it.

112
00:09:11,317 --> 00:09:12,852
We're running out of funds.

113
00:09:13,986 --> 00:09:15,855
Time to do some collections.

114
00:09:22,461 --> 00:09:23,629
I'll go ahead.

115
00:09:41,781 --> 00:09:45,017
Sir, we have a new batch of wines.
It's good.

116
00:09:45,818 --> 00:09:46,886
No, thank you.

117
00:09:55,461 --> 00:09:56,829
Why didn't you accept the offer?

118
00:09:57,496 --> 00:09:59,465
I thought wine is your favorite?

119
00:09:59,532 --> 00:10:02,735
You'll do everything
just to taste it, right?

120
00:10:08,507 --> 00:10:09,875
Are you jealous of Denise?

121
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:14,614
Don't get jealous, okay?

122
00:10:15,881 --> 00:10:16,749
I'm all yours.

123
00:10:19,552 --> 00:10:21,020
But like what I said earlier,

124
00:10:22,788 --> 00:10:25,558
I won't make a move
until you tell me, alright?

125
00:10:26,258 --> 00:10:27,326
So it's your move.

126
00:10:27,893 --> 00:10:29,261
I'll just wait.

127
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:33,566
Go ahead and eat.

128
00:10:34,266 --> 00:10:35,401
It's my treat.

129
00:10:43,442 --> 00:10:44,276
Two hundred.

130
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:52,585
So, is it clear now
where your loyalty should be?

131
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:56,088
Sir, please don't scold me.

132
00:10:56,288 --> 00:10:57,857
I'm just a fan of "GoRa".

133
00:10:58,391 --> 00:11:00,826
What's this? "GoRa"?

134
00:11:00,893 --> 00:11:03,929
Diego-Moira, the "GoRa" couple.

135
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:08,701
Do you want to do 200 laps more?

136
00:11:08,768 --> 00:11:12,004
Wait, sir. Six o'clock. Check it out.

137
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:19,979
Oh, no. That's danger.

138
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:24,850
Moira might end up with someone else
because you keep avoiding her.

139
00:11:26,585 --> 00:11:27,787
What a shame.

140
00:11:29,488 --> 00:11:31,390
Do you want to do 200 laps more?

141
00:11:45,237 --> 00:11:47,673
If you're not a doctor,
what would you have been?

142
00:11:49,842 --> 00:11:52,144
I have nothing in mind.
That's really my dream.

143
00:11:52,411 --> 00:11:56,082
When my brother and I were little,
we play pretend that he's the soldier

144
00:11:56,348 --> 00:11:58,084
and I would treat his wounds.

145
00:11:59,418 --> 00:12:01,654
-Really? You two were really close?
-Yes.

146
00:12:02,121 --> 00:12:06,492
Sometimes, he wanted us both
to play soldiers, but I didn't want to.

147
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:07,960
-Why?
-I don't think it suits me.

148
00:12:09,295 --> 00:12:13,099
I guess I'm not patriotic like you.

149
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,836
Why, what does patriotism mean to you?

150
00:12:18,537 --> 00:12:21,373
-What you are doing.
-What? Being a soldier?

151
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:26,045
Maxine,

152
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:34,820
being patriotic is not exclusive
to soldiers.

153
00:12:34,887 --> 00:12:40,459
Anyone can be patriotic
and show his love for the country.

154
00:12:40,526 --> 00:12:43,362
Even in the smallest way
he can, all right?

155
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:48,267
A simple example,
throwing your garbage properly.

156
00:12:49,034 --> 00:12:53,973
Helping the elders cross the street,

157
00:12:54,907 --> 00:13:00,279
or giving kids opportunity
because they are our future.

158
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:03,415
In doing the right thing
in whatever situation,

159
00:13:03,983 --> 00:13:06,285
even it means risking your safety,

160
00:13:06,352 --> 00:13:10,055
not letting other take advantage
and oppress the poor and the weak.

161
00:13:16,896 --> 00:13:18,597
You act like this is something new to you.

162
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:23,502
It's the 15th of the month
that's why we're here.

163
00:13:25,738 --> 00:13:30,810
Being patriotic starts
with a person's character.

164
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:36,015
Wow, there's a free lecture, too.

165
00:14:06,412 --> 00:14:09,582
Lucas, I was kidding.

166
00:14:09,815 --> 00:14:11,784
I appreciate everything you said.

167
00:14:11,917 --> 00:14:13,118
You were right.

168
00:14:16,922 --> 00:14:18,724
Just a second. Daniel…

169
00:14:20,726 --> 00:14:23,329
Please, look after Doc.
I just have to check something outside.

170
00:14:23,796 --> 00:14:25,231
Why? What is it? Will it take long?

171
00:14:25,297 --> 00:14:26,866
-You head to camp.
-I still have a shift.

172
00:14:26,932 --> 00:14:29,001
I'll leave the car keys with you.
I'll meet you there.

173
00:14:30,002 --> 00:14:31,503
Okay.

174
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:35,708
What happened?

175
00:14:40,112 --> 00:14:41,247
Do you know them?

176
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:45,050
No.

177
00:14:45,618 --> 00:14:49,488
Don't be scared.
Tell me if you know them. I got you.

178
00:14:52,992 --> 00:14:54,526
I don't want to get involved.

179
00:15:30,296 --> 00:15:33,265
Do you know where Lucas went?
I'll just follow him.

180
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:35,167
Daniel.

181
00:15:41,206 --> 00:15:43,642
Doc… it's better if you obey the Captain.

182
00:15:43,876 --> 00:15:46,011
You should go back to the camp.
You are safer there.

183
00:15:46,078 --> 00:15:46,912
Safe?

184
00:15:49,515 --> 00:15:51,417
You mean Lucas is in danger right now?

185
00:15:54,553 --> 00:15:56,288
You better give us money.

186
00:15:56,355 --> 00:15:57,823
Have pity on me.

187
00:15:58,757 --> 00:16:00,192
Just spare me.

188
00:16:01,593 --> 00:16:03,162
My wife is sick.

189
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:08,667
If we spare you today,
the others will follow.

190
00:16:09,134 --> 00:16:12,137
That's not possible.
Give us the money so you don't get hurt.

191
00:16:13,105 --> 00:16:15,274
Please, spare me.

192
00:16:26,785 --> 00:16:27,619
Hey!

193
00:16:33,225 --> 00:16:35,194
Hey! Let him go.

194
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:38,897
Let him go!

195
00:16:46,305 --> 00:16:47,606
Just do as the Captain says.

196
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:18,303
Greg?

197
00:17:18,904 --> 00:17:19,938
Lucas.

198
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:31,717
Long time no see, Bok.

199
00:17:32,317 --> 00:17:33,185
Bok.

200
00:17:37,489 --> 00:17:38,323
Bok, get down!

201
00:17:45,664 --> 00:17:46,598
Bok.

202
00:17:46,665 --> 00:17:47,733
Bok, you're wounded.

203
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:02,948
Medic! Medic!

204
00:18:04,249 --> 00:18:05,084
Bok…

205
00:18:06,051 --> 00:18:07,286
Tell my family…

206
00:18:08,353 --> 00:18:09,788
I love them so much.

207
00:18:09,855 --> 00:18:11,123
What am I, a messenger?

208
00:18:11,523 --> 00:18:13,926
Tell them that yourself
once you get out of here.

209
00:18:17,529 --> 00:18:18,397
Medic!

210
00:18:30,642 --> 00:18:32,311
What are you doing here in Urdan?

211
00:18:32,377 --> 00:18:33,812
I'm doing business.

212
00:18:33,879 --> 00:18:36,715
What else should I do
after I quit being a soldier?

213
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,288
What kind of business?

214
00:18:43,355 --> 00:18:45,691
I lend money, with interest.

215
00:18:45,757 --> 00:18:47,626
You know how hard
it is to collect payments.

216
00:18:47,693 --> 00:18:50,696
So, please excuse my men.

217
00:18:50,762 --> 00:18:53,365
They really have no intention
of hurting the old man.

218
00:19:07,446 --> 00:19:09,715
It looks like you've been here
in Urdan for a long time.

219
00:19:09,781 --> 00:19:11,517
You seem well-acquainted with the place.

220
00:19:13,051 --> 00:19:15,654
Do you know about the movements
of PRG here?

221
00:19:38,644 --> 00:19:39,912
How did that happen?

222
00:19:39,978 --> 00:19:42,347
We're just eating.
No one called for an emergency.

223
00:19:42,414 --> 00:19:43,382
Doc…

224
00:19:44,249 --> 00:19:45,384
calm down.

225
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:47,252
So, are there many rebels?

226
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:51,089
He should have called for backup.
Why did he go there alone?

227
00:19:51,156 --> 00:19:55,761
Captain Manalo is an experienced soldier.
He can handle himself. Don't worry.

228
00:19:56,728 --> 00:19:57,829
Don't worry?

229
00:20:00,265 --> 00:20:02,367
It's easier said than done.

230
00:20:03,769 --> 00:20:05,637
What if something bad happens to him?

231
00:20:05,704 --> 00:20:06,772
What if he gets hurt?

232
00:20:10,008 --> 00:20:14,313
How can I not worry
when risking his life is part of the job?

233
00:20:43,542 --> 00:20:44,843
Help me!

234
00:20:45,944 --> 00:20:47,179
Help me!

235
00:20:48,747 --> 00:20:49,715
Help!

236
00:20:50,983 --> 00:20:52,451
I don't want to die! Help!

237
00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:06,398
Help!

238
00:21:06,465 --> 00:21:08,033
Help me!

239
00:21:10,135 --> 00:21:12,170
I don't want to die! Help!

240
00:21:37,596 --> 00:21:39,431
Are you here because of PRG?

241
00:21:40,399 --> 00:21:44,403
Bok, all I can say is,
you should be careful.

242
00:21:44,469 --> 00:21:46,438
I'm also avoiding that group.

243
00:21:46,505 --> 00:21:50,108
Even my business is affected.
They're causing so much trouble.

244
00:21:52,644 --> 00:21:55,847
So, you know them?

245
00:21:56,648 --> 00:21:58,083
Don't get me involved, Bok.

246
00:21:58,150 --> 00:21:59,184
I'm a civilian now.

247
00:22:00,285 --> 00:22:02,354
I'm done with those kinds of encounters.

248
00:22:38,924 --> 00:22:40,125
Go ahead, answer it Bok.

249
00:22:40,659 --> 00:22:41,727
I'll just be here.

250
00:22:46,798 --> 00:22:47,632
Maxine?

251
00:22:47,699 --> 00:22:50,802
Lucas, help me, please.
I don't want to die.

252
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:52,371
Please. Come here, please.

253
00:22:54,339 --> 00:22:56,208
What happened to you? Where are you?

254
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:00,078
Keep those hidden.

255
00:23:11,289 --> 00:23:12,858
Where are you? What do you see?

256
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:14,559
It's a cliff.

257
00:23:15,227 --> 00:23:17,596
The car is about to fall
off the cliff, Lucas.

258
00:23:18,096 --> 00:23:19,898
Lucas, please, Lucas…

259
00:23:20,031 --> 00:23:21,867
Okay. I'll look for you. Don't be scared.

260
00:23:23,135 --> 00:23:24,136
Lucas, don't…

261
00:23:24,269 --> 00:23:25,103
Lucas?

262
00:23:26,104 --> 00:23:26,938
Lucas!

263
00:23:35,213 --> 00:23:37,048
I think I'm going to die here.

264
00:23:44,523 --> 00:23:46,425
-Thank you, Daniel.
-Be careful, Lucas.

265
00:24:00,939 --> 00:24:03,275
Mom…

266
00:24:03,408 --> 00:24:07,879
My bank account and my insurance policies,

267
00:24:07,946 --> 00:24:10,215
it's in the drawer in my room.

268
00:24:11,216 --> 00:24:12,517
I'm leaving it to you.

269
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:15,787
I hope…

270
00:24:15,854 --> 00:24:19,057
I hope you will be happy
even when I'm gone.

271
00:24:19,925 --> 00:24:22,861
Mom, sorry if…

272
00:24:24,429 --> 00:24:27,365
I stayed away from you.

273
00:24:27,499 --> 00:24:30,302
It's not what I wanted.

274
00:24:30,368 --> 00:24:31,203
I wish…

275
00:24:33,405 --> 00:24:35,407
I wish I visited you more often.

276
00:24:35,874 --> 00:24:37,409
I love you.

277
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:40,111
Mom, I love you.

278
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:42,948
I love you so much.

279
00:24:44,683 --> 00:24:48,253
Tell Sandra that I also love her.

280
00:25:01,233 --> 00:25:05,270
Lucas! Help!

281
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:09,808
I'm going to die.

282
00:25:15,847 --> 00:25:16,748
Maxine.

283
00:25:17,749 --> 00:25:18,583
Lucas!

284
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:19,784
How are you?

285
00:25:19,851 --> 00:25:21,219
I'm… I'm okay.

286
00:25:21,286 --> 00:25:22,320
Okay.

287
00:25:24,222 --> 00:25:25,624
Open your window, okay?

288
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:28,426
Open the window, now.

289
00:25:28,493 --> 00:25:29,494
Okay, okay.

290
00:25:29,561 --> 00:25:30,562
Right now.

291
00:25:39,604 --> 00:25:40,872
What are you doing?

292
00:25:41,773 --> 00:25:43,875
We will really fall
with what you're doing!

293
00:25:43,942 --> 00:25:44,943
Maxine.

294
00:25:45,410 --> 00:25:48,713
Maxine, okay, the car is too heavy.

295
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:50,348
We will slide off the rocks.

296
00:25:50,448 --> 00:25:52,450
This is the only way for us to get out.

297
00:25:52,517 --> 00:25:53,518
How?

298
00:25:54,686 --> 00:25:55,787
Are you crazy?

299
00:25:55,854 --> 00:25:58,156
I will die with what you're about to do.

300
00:26:03,261 --> 00:26:04,195
Don't move a lot.

301
00:26:04,262 --> 00:26:06,364
What are we going to do, Lucas?

302
00:26:08,533 --> 00:26:09,568
Maxine, Maxine…

303
00:26:10,902 --> 00:26:13,004
I won't let go of you, okay?

304
00:26:13,738 --> 00:26:15,407
You will not die.
I'll get you out of here.

305
00:26:15,473 --> 00:26:18,510
-What? I'm scared.
-This is the only way, Maxine.

306
00:26:18,577 --> 00:26:20,178
Take your foot off the brake.

307
00:26:20,245 --> 00:26:21,413
I don't want to.

308
00:26:21,479 --> 00:26:23,548
-Release the brake, Maxine.
-I don't want to!

309
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:26,351
Lucas, what are you doing?

310
00:26:55,847 --> 00:26:56,948
Are you hurt?

311
00:26:58,817 --> 00:26:59,951
No.

312
00:27:00,018 --> 00:27:01,052
Okay, good.

313
00:27:03,355 --> 00:27:05,156
Let's go back to the camp,
so you can rest.

314
00:27:05,256 --> 00:27:07,726
What? What did you say?

315
00:27:10,128 --> 00:27:12,597
You're unbelievable! Are you a robot?

316
00:27:13,264 --> 00:27:16,167
Can't you see I'm still weak?
I'm not used to these things.

317
00:27:19,504 --> 00:27:20,772
My heart is beating fast.

318
00:27:23,742 --> 00:27:25,343
What are you doing to me?

319
00:27:26,711 --> 00:27:29,180
Why is it like this?

320
00:27:29,614 --> 00:27:31,449
So, I make your heart beat faster?

321
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:39,524
Lucas what are you doing?

322
00:27:39,591 --> 00:27:43,662
Just because you saved me
and our lips touched,

323
00:27:43,728 --> 00:27:44,829
do not mean you can do this.

324
00:27:44,896 --> 00:27:46,665
I don't want to. I don't want that, Lucas.

325
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:49,534
I'm just giving you this to wear.

326
00:27:50,068 --> 00:27:53,004
Your blouse is wet
and I can see through it.

327
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:55,974
Give me that!

328
00:28:33,812 --> 00:28:36,948
We need more people like you.

329
00:28:37,082 --> 00:28:40,285
If I get in, can you mentor me?

330
00:28:41,953 --> 00:28:43,254
Are you jealous?

331
00:28:43,321 --> 00:28:44,823
Don't worry…

332
00:28:44,889 --> 00:28:47,525
because the person I like is
right in front of me.

333
00:28:47,592 --> 00:28:51,563
I told you. You'll eventually
cross paths with your old buddy.

334
00:28:51,696 --> 00:28:54,265
Don't worry, Bullet. I misled him.

335
00:28:55,133 --> 00:28:57,402
He's not the same Greg
that I used to know.

336
00:28:57,469 --> 00:29:00,138
Are you thinking he's connected
with the PRG here in Urdan?

337
00:29:00,205 --> 00:29:02,674
Does he know something about
at happened with General Manalo?

338
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:05,410
If he has something to do
with what happened to my father,

339
00:29:05,477 --> 00:29:07,178
-then, I can never forgive him.
-Janet!

340
00:29:07,846 --> 00:29:09,581
I don't think
who you're looking for is here.

341
00:29:09,647 --> 00:29:10,882
The doctor is almost here.

342
00:29:11,049 --> 00:29:12,484
Here she is.

343
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:15,120
-What happened?
-Doctor, please save my baby.

344
00:29:15,186 --> 00:29:16,254
Put your hands up.

345
00:29:20,158 --> 00:29:21,192
Enemies!
