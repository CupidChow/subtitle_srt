1
00:00:11,644 --> 00:00:16,116
To be honest, Moira is still in danger.

2
00:00:16,182 --> 00:00:18,051
But I hope she can handle the medicine.

3
00:00:18,118 --> 00:00:19,586
What else can we do to help?

4
00:00:19,652 --> 00:00:24,290
Right now, we just need
to monitor the other patients.

5
00:00:24,357 --> 00:00:28,061
Aside from that, we have to make sure
that no one else is infected by the toxin.

6
00:00:28,128 --> 00:00:29,262
Go to the Medicube.

7
00:00:29,329 --> 00:00:31,998
Tell them someone is infected
with the virus here.

8
00:00:32,065 --> 00:00:33,500
Ask for help, please.

9
00:00:33,566 --> 00:00:35,535
With the way Biboy described the patient,

10
00:00:35,602 --> 00:00:39,739
Doc Maxine is so sure that he was
the PRG rebel who attacked the camp.

11
00:00:39,806 --> 00:00:42,842
Doc Maxine really needs
to go to Miss Sheila

12
00:00:42,909 --> 00:00:46,312
and check the people of Sitio Santos
so the toxin will not spread.

13
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:47,847
You can't be a leader, Greg.

14
00:00:47,914 --> 00:00:51,484
You don't even have a strategy.
You just let your cohorts fool you.

15
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,161
Where are you going?

16
00:01:01,227 --> 00:01:02,629
Damn you. You got us tired.

17
00:01:09,102 --> 00:01:11,438
We need to check if he's still okay.

18
00:01:11,504 --> 00:01:12,639
Doc, it's dangerous.

19
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:14,240
What if he is a rebel?

20
00:01:14,307 --> 00:01:16,242
<i>Even if he's a rebel, he is still human.</i>

21
00:01:16,309 --> 00:01:18,044
<i>We need to help him.</i>

22
00:01:18,545 --> 00:01:19,412
<i>Bullet is gone.</i>

23
00:01:19,479 --> 00:01:23,917
If you are like me
who is fed up with being stepped on

24
00:01:23,983 --> 00:01:26,052
and defeated by the soldiers.

25
00:01:26,119 --> 00:01:30,924
<i>If you are fed up being weak
like our former leader,</i>

26
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:32,525
follow me.

27
00:01:33,793 --> 00:01:37,931
This is the beginning
of a new leadership in PRG.

28
00:02:01,921 --> 00:02:07,060
We will have your blood tested first
before we can give any medicine.

29
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:11,498
Is Buboy really sick?

30
00:02:12,665 --> 00:02:13,633
Buboy?

31
00:02:15,435 --> 00:02:18,438
He said his name is Buboy
before he had difficulty breathing.

32
00:02:18,505 --> 00:02:22,008
Well, based on our observation,

33
00:02:22,075 --> 00:02:25,612
it's possible that he is also infected
with the toxin released in the Medicube.

34
00:02:25,678 --> 00:02:30,250
It's better to give him medicine
before we wait for the test results.

35
00:02:31,117 --> 00:02:36,422
You have to come with us
to the Medicube for observation.

36
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:41,561
How about my son, Biboy. How is he?

37
00:02:41,628 --> 00:02:43,630
Have you tested him?

38
00:02:43,696 --> 00:02:44,898
Is he safe?

39
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:51,771
I don't care if I get sick,
just not my son.

40
00:03:20,767 --> 00:03:21,801
Doc, no!

41
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:23,770
Doc, no! Stay right here!

42
00:03:24,771 --> 00:03:25,772
Stay here.

43
00:03:25,838 --> 00:03:28,308
We need to check if he's still okay.

44
00:03:28,374 --> 00:03:29,742
Doc, it's dangerous.

45
00:03:29,809 --> 00:03:31,110
What if he is a rebel?

46
00:03:31,177 --> 00:03:33,446
Even if he's a rebel, he is still human.

47
00:03:33,513 --> 00:03:35,048
We need to help him.

48
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:08,648
The facial composite
of PRG leaders have arrived.

49
00:04:10,717 --> 00:04:13,253
He is our leader who died.

50
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:18,224
I don't know his name
but we call him alias Bullet.

51
00:04:19,659 --> 00:04:20,927
Don't come near!

52
00:04:22,061 --> 00:04:23,363
Don't come near. I will kill her.

53
00:04:24,464 --> 00:04:25,732
Put your gun down.

54
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:33,840
Harry Potter, the target!

55
00:04:33,906 --> 00:04:35,341
-The target!
-Bullet is missing.

56
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,189
Biboy's test result came out.

57
00:05:23,256 --> 00:05:25,858
He's okay. He's not infected.

58
00:05:25,925 --> 00:05:27,694
<i>Thank you. That's good to know.</i>

59
00:05:29,696 --> 00:05:31,197
How are you?

60
00:05:31,264 --> 00:05:33,433
<i>The procedure earlier was full of tension.</i>

61
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:35,201
<i>Is this really how things are in Urdan?</i>

62
00:05:36,069 --> 00:05:39,205
<i>Guns are pointed at you
while you are operating on a patient?</i>

63
00:05:39,972 --> 00:05:42,308
I'm sure you're still focused
on what you were doing

64
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:45,578
and you saved the person you are helping.

65
00:05:45,645 --> 00:05:50,183
<i>Good thing, the bullet
did not penetrate deep into his body.</i>

66
00:05:50,249 --> 00:05:53,386
<i>But, Lucas, I still need
to take him to the Medicube</i>

67
00:05:53,453 --> 00:05:54,954
<i>for blood transfusion.</i>

68
00:05:55,755 --> 00:05:59,726
<i>Is it okay to take him there
and be with the other patients?</i>

69
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:02,328
Yes, of course.

70
00:06:02,395 --> 00:06:05,498
We will not turn our backs
on anyone who needs help.

71
00:06:06,332 --> 00:06:09,001
But, of course, once he's here
we need to talk to him

72
00:06:09,068 --> 00:06:11,904
to confirm if he is a
member of PRG or not.

73
00:06:11,971 --> 00:06:14,774
<i>What if he is not a rebel?</i>

74
00:06:14,841 --> 00:06:16,609
<i>What if he is just a victim?</i>

75
00:06:17,643 --> 00:06:19,579
That's why we need to talk to him.

76
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:22,548
That is why we need to interrogate him.

77
00:06:24,117 --> 00:06:27,387
Maxine, I know you have a soft heart
for your patients.

78
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:33,493
Once we confirm
that he is really a member of PRG,

79
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:38,398
I'm sorry, but he will be imprisoned.

80
00:06:50,009 --> 00:06:53,746
<i>Okay, I'll see you later.</i>

81
00:06:53,813 --> 00:06:55,581
<i>I have to go back to my patient.</i>

82
00:06:55,648 --> 00:06:57,850
Okay, see you later.

83
00:06:57,917 --> 00:06:58,951
<i>Okay, bye.</i>

84
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:14,700
Can you radio the Medicube?

85
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:17,470
We are out of medical supplies
and I need more.

86
00:07:18,871 --> 00:07:20,173
Okay, Doc.

87
00:07:20,239 --> 00:07:22,408
I will also report to Captain Manalo.

88
00:07:22,909 --> 00:07:24,977
We'll be outside if you need anything.

89
00:08:10,022 --> 00:08:12,191
Is that really you, Rodel?

90
00:10:51,417 --> 00:10:54,987
Big Boss, it looks like
we need backup here.

91
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:57,089
Why?

92
00:10:58,124 --> 00:11:01,127
I think Doc Maxine
didn't help just an ordinary rebel.

93
00:11:01,861 --> 00:11:05,131
He is the leader of the PRG
we are looking for, Big Boss.

94
00:11:05,197 --> 00:11:06,265
It's Bullet.

95
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:52,378
Brother?

96
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:08,694
<i>Brother, be careful.</i>

97
00:12:08,761 --> 00:12:10,663
They should be careful with me.

98
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,631
Yeah, right.

99
00:12:14,867 --> 00:12:17,436
-Seriously, be careful.
-Yes, of course.

100
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:34,019
My child.

101
00:12:38,124 --> 00:12:39,558
<i>We waited in the camp.</i>

102
00:12:40,292 --> 00:12:43,929
<i>They brought in all the dead
bodies except for my brother's.</i>

103
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:46,132
<i>So…</i>

104
00:12:47,366 --> 00:12:50,536
<i>no one really knows
if he is still alive or not.</i>

105
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:56,041
<i>This came directly
from the General Headquarters.</i>

106
00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:08,320
He was last seen in Isabela.

107
00:13:08,387 --> 00:13:10,289
He is already declared dead.

108
00:13:10,356 --> 00:13:12,792
The vehicle that
they were riding exploded.

109
00:13:13,859 --> 00:13:15,161
There's only one survivor.

110
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:20,766
My brother.

111
00:13:48,561 --> 00:13:50,262
Keep a close watch over there.

112
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:52,865
Make sure the locals won't suspect.

113
00:13:59,138 --> 00:14:00,606
Be careful with your actions.

114
00:14:01,607 --> 00:14:04,844
This may be our only chance
to capture Bullet.

115
00:14:06,212 --> 00:14:07,947
He cannot escape this time.

116
00:14:09,748 --> 00:14:11,350
You can count on us.

117
00:14:13,619 --> 00:14:16,155
Make sure
the people of Sitio Santos are safe,

118
00:14:16,222 --> 00:14:17,857
especially the medical team.

119
00:14:23,562 --> 00:14:27,299
Don't worry, Big Boss.
The patient is still unconscious.

120
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:28,834
We'll start clearing the area.

121
00:15:17,683 --> 00:15:18,984
Hey…

122
00:15:20,953 --> 00:15:22,554
Rodel, it's me.

123
00:15:28,827 --> 00:15:30,462
Yes, Sir Dela Cruz.

124
00:15:46,578 --> 00:15:47,680
Brother.

125
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:33,659
Big Boss, what's your plan
after we capture Bullet?

126
00:16:33,726 --> 00:16:37,529
He will pay for all his sins
especially for what he did to my father.

127
00:16:38,864 --> 00:16:40,599
He will rot in jail.

128
00:16:50,709 --> 00:16:53,145
Rodel, wait a second. Wait!

129
00:16:53,946 --> 00:16:55,881
You're not yet okay. Wait.

130
00:16:56,715 --> 00:16:58,083
How did this happen?

131
00:17:00,319 --> 00:17:01,587
And where are we?

132
00:17:01,653 --> 00:17:03,889
We are in Sitio Santos.

133
00:17:03,956 --> 00:17:08,327
We saw you unconscious and wounded,
that's why I treated you.

134
00:17:17,469 --> 00:17:18,570
-There he is.
-There!

135
00:17:18,637 --> 00:17:19,571
Run after him, hurry!

136
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:23,308
I will kill this animal.

137
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:24,643
Then shoot!

138
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:32,284
Wait a second. What's with you?

139
00:17:33,352 --> 00:17:35,888
Rodel, you're not yet well.

140
00:17:35,954 --> 00:17:38,857
We still need to take you to the Medicube
for blood transfusion.

141
00:17:40,526 --> 00:17:41,493
Medicube?

142
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:46,231
Are you with the soldiers?

143
00:17:52,304 --> 00:17:53,205
Where are they?

144
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:56,742
Maxine, you have to get me out of here.

145
00:18:02,214 --> 00:18:03,849
Rodel, what's with you?

146
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:06,485
Don't be scared. I'll take care of you.

147
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:09,788
No.

148
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:18,530
Ma'am, sir, please stay inside your house.

149
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:20,232
There's something we need to take care of.

150
00:18:20,299 --> 00:18:21,867
Is this about the virus?

151
00:18:22,568 --> 00:18:23,869
We might get infected.

152
00:18:24,369 --> 00:18:27,172
We will take out those
who are exposed and sick.

153
00:18:27,239 --> 00:18:30,075
It's better you stay inside your homes
before our operation.

154
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:33,045
You may go home now. Apologies.

155
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:35,247
-Okay, be careful.
-Just doing our jobs.

156
00:18:36,915 --> 00:18:38,050
Thank you, sir.

157
00:18:40,052 --> 00:18:40,886
Rodel.

158
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:43,989
Maxine, they are sending people away.

159
00:18:44,056 --> 00:18:46,391
Brother, we need to move some patients.

160
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:48,660
We don't want others to get infected.

161
00:18:48,727 --> 00:18:50,429
That's just safety precaution.

162
00:18:50,496 --> 00:18:52,631
No, they've recognized me.

163
00:18:52,698 --> 00:18:54,099
They know I'm here.

164
00:18:56,502 --> 00:18:57,736
Why?

165
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:01,907
Who are you?

166
00:19:17,689 --> 00:19:19,057
Sir, this way.

167
00:19:44,716 --> 00:19:49,254
Look how playful destiny is.

168
00:19:50,722 --> 00:19:51,590
Sometimes…

169
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:58,664
you get a reward without any trouble.

170
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:00,532
Who are you?

171
00:20:00,599 --> 00:20:02,201
You really want to know me?

172
00:20:02,267 --> 00:20:06,438
Once you see my face, it means
you can no longer get out of here alive.

173
00:20:06,505 --> 00:20:08,173
Just a second, don't.

174
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:10,943
I'm begging you, don't hurt her.

175
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:15,847
-One.
-No, no.

176
00:20:15,914 --> 00:20:16,949
-Two.
-No!

177
00:20:19,585 --> 00:20:20,819
Let her go!

178
00:20:23,455 --> 00:20:24,990
Where are you going?

179
00:20:25,691 --> 00:20:27,759
-Where are the other two?
-Let them go, Rodel.

180
00:20:29,494 --> 00:20:30,896
I'm here.

181
00:20:30,963 --> 00:20:32,097
I'll save you.

182
00:20:35,601 --> 00:20:37,936
You fell into my trap, Captain Manalo.

183
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:41,873
You're a rebel.

184
00:20:45,844 --> 00:20:47,112
But why?

185
00:20:47,713 --> 00:20:49,248
How did this happen?

186
00:20:49,314 --> 00:20:50,782
You're a soldier, right?

187
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:54,219
-How did this happen?
-Be quiet.

188
00:21:21,546 --> 00:21:23,715
Why didn't you show yourself
to me and Mom?

189
00:21:24,783 --> 00:21:27,352
Why did you pretend to be dead?

190
00:21:27,419 --> 00:21:30,022
I'll explain it to you some other time.

191
00:21:30,088 --> 00:21:32,824
I need to get out of here
before the soldiers arrive.

192
00:22:56,842 --> 00:22:57,843
Where is he?

193
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:00,345
Where did he go?

194
00:23:20,766 --> 00:23:23,235
Search for him by the river.

195
00:23:23,301 --> 00:23:26,004
Make sure he doesn't
cross to the other town.

196
00:23:26,071 --> 00:23:27,272
He can't escape.

197
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:06,678
Did he hurt you?

198
00:24:08,213 --> 00:24:10,782
Don't worry, we will catch him.

199
00:24:42,881 --> 00:24:44,015
The area is cleared.

200
00:24:45,183 --> 00:24:46,651
Bullet escaped.

201
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:52,484
<i>I know very well
if you are going through something.</i>

202
00:25:53,251 --> 00:25:56,588
What if you find out
that Rodel is still alive?

203
00:25:56,655 --> 00:25:58,089
<i>Why do you ask?</i>

204
00:25:58,156 --> 00:26:00,425
It only means
there is faction in their group.

205
00:26:00,492 --> 00:26:03,261
Do you think Bullet left the PRG?

206
00:26:03,328 --> 00:26:05,864
We are not sure, sir.
But we will find out.

207
00:26:05,931 --> 00:26:09,534
Because we can easily bring them down
while they are having internal problems.

208
00:26:09,601 --> 00:26:11,770
Get out, Diego.

209
00:26:11,836 --> 00:26:13,605
Help! Medical Team!

210
00:26:13,672 --> 00:26:15,807
-Help, help.
-Is Doc Maxine here yet?

211
00:26:15,874 --> 00:26:19,244
Doc Earl, Doc Maxine
is not here in Medicube.

212
00:26:19,311 --> 00:26:20,145
Where did she go?

213
00:26:20,211 --> 00:26:23,448
You are my brother.
Of course, I can't just abandon you.

214
00:26:23,515 --> 00:26:27,319
But let me warn you. If you came here
to convince me to surrender,

215
00:26:27,385 --> 00:26:28,653
you're just wasting your time.

216
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:31,957
I'll do everything to capture this person.

217
00:26:33,024 --> 00:26:35,994
Lucas, there's something
I need to tell you.
