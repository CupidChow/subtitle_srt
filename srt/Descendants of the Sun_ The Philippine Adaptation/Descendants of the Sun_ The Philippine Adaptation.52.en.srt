1
00:00:11,244 --> 00:00:12,779
When I was in the military,

2
00:00:13,246 --> 00:00:15,448
I fell in love
with a PRG member, Janet.

3
00:00:15,515 --> 00:00:19,085
I was helping them get weapons,
but soon after,

4
00:00:19,152 --> 00:00:21,321
Lt. General Abraham
Manalo caught me.

5
00:00:21,788 --> 00:00:23,256
I got fired from service.

6
00:00:23,323 --> 00:00:27,227
So I went up the mountains
until I became the leader of the group.

7
00:00:27,694 --> 00:00:31,064
Is that why you took vengeance
on Lt. General Manalo?

8
00:00:31,131 --> 00:00:32,165
And you almost killed him?

9
00:00:32,632 --> 00:00:34,834
Why are you defending
those soldiers?

10
00:00:36,603 --> 00:00:37,804
Is it because of that Lucas?

11
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:38,772
Who is more important to you?

12
00:00:38,838 --> 00:00:40,006
That fool or me, your brother?

13
00:00:40,473 --> 00:00:41,508
I love Lucas.

14
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:44,577
Did you know that my wife and
child died because of that man?

15
00:00:44,644 --> 00:00:46,646
That is why I will not stop
until I kill those

16
00:00:46,713 --> 00:00:47,747
soldiers
who ruined my life.

17
00:00:47,814 --> 00:00:50,083
I know that you just want to help.

18
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:51,684
But you know the protocol here.

19
00:00:51,751 --> 00:00:54,487
You can't leave the camp
without a military escort.

20
00:00:54,554 --> 00:00:55,622
It's dangerous.

21
00:00:55,688 --> 00:00:56,589
Big Boss.

22
00:00:56,656 --> 00:01:00,293
Jess, the former PRG member
that we captured, escaped.

23
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:03,663
Boy helped me escape
the military camp.

24
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:05,031
We're looking for you to help you.

25
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:08,101
Pistol is still after you.

26
00:01:08,568 --> 00:01:11,438
Bullet, many of us still support you.

27
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:13,406
We'll help you fight Pistol.

28
00:01:13,473 --> 00:01:14,774
There's something you need to know.

29
00:01:14,841 --> 00:01:16,476
Diego, please.

30
00:01:16,543 --> 00:01:17,710
What are you guys talking about?

31
00:01:17,777 --> 00:01:19,112
What is it that I need to know?

32
00:01:19,179 --> 00:01:21,614
The reason why he used
to be against our relationship

33
00:01:21,681 --> 00:01:24,217
is because he's afraid for
us to find out about his

34
00:01:24,284 --> 00:01:26,719
connection with my mother.

35
00:01:26,786 --> 00:01:28,388
Have you seen Doc Moira?

36
00:01:28,455 --> 00:01:29,689
I didn't see her leave.

37
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:31,191
I wonder where she went.

38
00:01:31,257 --> 00:01:32,425
Maxine…

39
00:01:33,159 --> 00:01:34,694
What are you doing here?

40
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:36,196
Doc, who is he?

41
00:01:36,262 --> 00:01:37,764
Maxine, you brought someone else?

42
00:01:37,831 --> 00:01:38,765
Brother.

43
00:01:38,832 --> 00:01:39,666
Don't move.

44
00:01:39,732 --> 00:01:41,267
Brother, put that down.

45
00:01:41,334 --> 00:01:43,703
Doc, he is your brother?

46
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:46,339
Hazel, it's a long story.

47
00:01:46,406 --> 00:01:47,507
I'll tell you some other time.

48
00:01:47,574 --> 00:01:48,908
Brother, just stop it please.

49
00:01:52,512 --> 00:01:55,548
Hazel, please don't tell anyone.

50
00:01:55,615 --> 00:01:57,851
No one must know about this, okay?

51
00:01:57,917 --> 00:01:59,519
Promise me.

52
00:01:59,586 --> 00:02:01,855
Yes, Doc.

53
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:06,626
Brother, what are
you doing here?

54
00:02:06,693 --> 00:02:08,828
Maxine, you know
what I want.

55
00:02:08,895 --> 00:02:11,731
I can't give you what you want.

56
00:02:12,232 --> 00:02:13,600
I already told you that, remember?

57
00:02:13,666 --> 00:02:15,401
Will you obey me or do you want
something bad to happen?

58
00:02:15,468 --> 00:02:17,070
Brother, what's with you?

59
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:18,371
How long will you keep on doing this?

60
00:02:18,438 --> 00:02:19,606
When are you going to stop?

61
00:02:19,672 --> 00:02:22,542
Not until I get my revenge
on the people who destroyed my life.

62
00:02:23,009 --> 00:02:25,912
Brother, you need to stop.

63
00:02:27,614 --> 00:02:28,815
What are you going to do?

64
00:02:29,482 --> 00:02:30,316
Moira.

65
00:02:30,383 --> 00:02:32,418
Dad, answer my questions first!

66
00:02:33,052 --> 00:02:34,921
Is Diego telling the truth?

67
00:02:35,522 --> 00:02:36,623
My child let me explain.

68
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,035
He's telling the truth.

69
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:56,976
Dad, you knew Diego
ever since he was young, right?

70
00:02:57,043 --> 00:02:58,278
Yes.

71
00:02:59,145 --> 00:03:00,647
Why do you ask?

72
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:03,516
It's always has been a
sore topic between us.

73
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:07,320
He doesn't like talking about his parents,
especially about his mother.

74
00:03:08,588 --> 00:03:11,991
Do you know his mother, by any chance?

75
00:03:12,058 --> 00:03:14,894
Diego was an orphan when I met him.

76
00:03:14,961 --> 00:03:16,796
He was in the Boys Town.

77
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:18,298
I took pity on him.

78
00:03:19,732 --> 00:03:22,235
I saw that he had so much potential.

79
00:03:22,302 --> 00:03:24,637
He said that he also wanted
to become a soldier.

80
00:03:32,345 --> 00:03:36,583
And you knew all this time that
he is the son of the woman you hurt?

81
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:47,627
I'm sorry, Moira because I've hurt you.

82
00:03:48,695 --> 00:03:51,664
But every time I see you,
I remember all of the pain,

83
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:54,133
and all of the anger.

84
00:05:25,692 --> 00:05:26,926
Diego!

85
00:05:38,538 --> 00:05:40,006
I will call Lucas.

86
00:05:40,073 --> 00:05:41,174
What?

87
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:44,277
I'm not going to let innocent people
get involved because of your actions.

88
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:45,745
Maxine, give that to me!

89
00:05:45,812 --> 00:05:47,213
Let me go!

90
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,448
Maxine, don't make me mad.

91
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:49,682
What? Why?

92
00:05:49,749 --> 00:05:50,883
You're going to hurt me?

93
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:52,051
Go ahead then!

94
00:05:52,118 --> 00:05:53,252
Hurt me!

95
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:55,955
I can't hurt you.

96
00:05:58,491 --> 00:06:00,059
But I can hurt myself!

97
00:06:00,126 --> 00:06:01,160
Brother!

98
00:06:01,794 --> 00:06:04,630
Maxine, I would rather die
than surrender to them.

99
00:06:49,942 --> 00:06:52,178
Brother, please don't.

100
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:53,379
Go on!

101
00:06:53,446 --> 00:06:56,616
Tell Lucas so you'll experience
losing a brother again.

102
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:02,388
Maxine, remember this.

103
00:07:04,524 --> 00:07:08,294
If you sell me out to Lucas
or to his fellow soldiers,

104
00:07:09,962 --> 00:07:12,298
I won't hesitate to hurt myself.

105
00:07:13,666 --> 00:07:14,600
Do you understand?

106
00:07:39,158 --> 00:07:41,027
Technical Sergeant Ramos.

107
00:07:43,596 --> 00:07:45,765
Why didn't you tell
me the truth?

108
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:54,841
To be honest…

109
00:07:57,243 --> 00:07:58,377
I got scared.

110
00:07:58,878 --> 00:08:00,947
But I'm your girlfriend.

111
00:08:01,514 --> 00:08:03,616
We shouldn't hide anything
from one another.

112
00:08:03,683 --> 00:08:06,185
What happened to me was no joke, Moira.

113
00:08:08,454 --> 00:08:09,856
What your dad did to me was no joke!

114
00:08:12,225 --> 00:08:15,394
I was betrayed by the
person I respected the most.

115
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:21,167
It's as if I was punched in the gut
and kicked over and over again.

116
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:29,308
Can you still forgive him?

117
00:08:35,448 --> 00:08:36,916
What about us?

118
00:08:39,819 --> 00:08:41,120
What will happen to us?

119
00:08:49,161 --> 00:08:54,433
Is it that easy for you to give
up everything we've fought for?

120
00:09:10,783 --> 00:09:11,851
Diego.

121
00:09:41,948 --> 00:09:46,852
Doc, why don't we tell Captain Lucas?

122
00:09:47,687 --> 00:09:49,655
We need to stop your brother.

123
00:09:49,722 --> 00:09:52,458
You saw what he did earlier.

124
00:09:52,525 --> 00:09:54,527
I don't want him to hurt himself.

125
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:57,096
Lucas must not know about this.

126
00:09:57,163 --> 00:10:00,232
What if they end up hurting each other?

127
00:10:00,299 --> 00:10:02,468
What if innocent people get hurt?

128
00:10:02,868 --> 00:10:04,070
Hazel!

129
00:10:04,136 --> 00:10:05,938
Can you please give me some time?

130
00:10:06,005 --> 00:10:08,040
I'll fix it. Promise!

131
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:11,077
I'll talk to my brother
but you also need to promise me

132
00:10:11,143 --> 00:10:13,746
that you will not
tell Lucas. Okay?

133
00:10:16,882 --> 00:10:17,984
What won't you tell me?

134
00:10:23,723 --> 00:10:24,857
What won't you tell me?

135
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:28,294
That Captain Moira is missing.

136
00:10:28,361 --> 00:10:29,562
What?

137
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:30,763
Where did she go?

138
00:10:32,064 --> 00:10:36,235
What I mean is, she was missing earlier

139
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:37,903
but we found her already.

140
00:10:39,605 --> 00:10:41,107
Doc, I'll go ahead.

141
00:10:41,173 --> 00:10:42,241
Okay.

142
00:10:46,746 --> 00:10:47,813
That was strange.

143
00:10:56,956 --> 00:10:57,957
Are you okay?

144
00:10:58,424 --> 00:10:59,325
Yes.

145
00:11:01,293 --> 00:11:02,728
You're sweating a lot.

146
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:05,798
Well, it's hot out here.

147
00:11:06,565 --> 00:11:09,001
I'll go inside.

148
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:10,503
I need some cool air.

149
00:11:10,569 --> 00:11:11,637
Okay.

150
00:11:21,247 --> 00:11:24,250
The reason why he used to be
against our relationship

151
00:11:24,316 --> 00:11:29,789
is because he's afraid we might find out
about his connection with my mother.

152
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:33,926
But he left my mother for you
and your mom.

153
00:11:34,326 --> 00:11:38,698
I was young back then,
and yet I was full of anger…

154
00:11:38,764 --> 00:11:43,469
towards the man who caused
my mother's death….

155
00:11:44,303 --> 00:11:46,138
why I'm all by myself,

156
00:11:47,573 --> 00:11:49,375
the reason why my world crashed.

157
00:11:56,348 --> 00:11:57,183
My child.

158
00:12:03,589 --> 00:12:04,523
My child…

159
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:12,031
I know you are mad at me.

160
00:12:12,832 --> 00:12:14,734
But I hope we can talk.

161
00:12:19,772 --> 00:12:22,074
How can you do that to Diego's mother?

162
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:26,946
How could you hurt her like that?

163
00:12:35,354 --> 00:12:37,223
But I hope you will understand…

164
00:12:39,024 --> 00:12:40,626
that what I did was not easy.

165
00:12:45,297 --> 00:12:46,732
I had a decision to make…

166
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:49,935
and I chose you.

167
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:57,042
I didn't want to hurt anyone.

168
00:13:00,346 --> 00:13:05,951
All my life, I regret what
happened to Diego's mother.

169
00:13:09,321 --> 00:13:13,826
That's why I did everything
to make it up to him.

170
00:13:18,397 --> 00:13:22,668
And that is why you were against
my relationship with Diego from the start.

171
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:25,437
Yes.

172
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,842
I was afraid that you
would find out the truth.

173
00:13:31,143 --> 00:13:32,912
I tried to protect you…

174
00:13:35,514 --> 00:13:36,816
and in doing so,

175
00:13:39,285 --> 00:13:41,220
I hurt you even more.

176
00:13:43,255 --> 00:13:47,459
You shouldn't have
underestimated my ability

177
00:13:47,526 --> 00:13:49,428
to understand the situation.

178
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:54,133
But that's what you chose to do.

179
00:13:55,568 --> 00:13:57,570
That's why Diego
and I didn't have a chance.

180
00:13:58,404 --> 00:14:00,806
We didn't get a chance because of that.

181
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:54,493
Are you sure that the supplier
that we will meet is good?

182
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,861
Yes, Pistol.

183
00:14:55,928 --> 00:14:57,596
Everything is high quality.

184
00:14:57,663 --> 00:14:58,631
It came from America.

185
00:14:59,965 --> 00:15:00,833
Bullet!

186
00:15:04,803 --> 00:15:05,704
After them!

187
00:15:06,672 --> 00:15:07,606
That's okay.

188
00:15:07,673 --> 00:15:08,540
Just let them go.

189
00:15:08,941 --> 00:15:10,910
They have nowhere to run.

190
00:15:10,976 --> 00:15:12,778
The important thing is that I
have the PRG back

191
00:15:12,845 --> 00:15:14,780
and no one can take it away from me.

192
00:15:15,447 --> 00:15:17,716
I will finish what I've started.

193
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:23,956
Tonight, we will attack the
enemy using the coordinates

194
00:15:24,023 --> 00:15:25,824
provided by our intelligence.

195
00:15:26,892 --> 00:15:28,427
We will crush them.

196
00:15:59,825 --> 00:16:01,126
Long live, Bullet!

197
00:16:01,193 --> 00:16:02,127
Long live!

198
00:16:03,495 --> 00:16:04,897
Pistol is still our leader.

199
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:08,267
What did you say?

200
00:16:13,238 --> 00:16:15,174
Pistol is the only one who we'll obey.
No one else!

201
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:43,235
Who's next?

202
00:16:50,642 --> 00:16:51,477
Bravo…

203
00:17:04,223 --> 00:17:06,825
Bullet, the soldiers are attacking us.

204
00:17:06,892 --> 00:17:08,160
Get out of here!

205
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:27,713
How are you feeling?

206
00:17:38,857 --> 00:17:43,462
Moira, if you need someone
to talk to, I'm just here.

207
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:49,468
Doc Maxine.

208
00:17:50,369 --> 00:17:51,203
Why?

209
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:54,073
Captain Manalo and the Alpha Team
just returned

210
00:17:54,139 --> 00:17:56,575
from an operation against the PRG.

211
00:17:58,343 --> 00:18:00,045
Technical Sergeant Ramos…

212
00:18:02,047 --> 00:18:03,182
got shot on the chest.

213
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:04,950
He needs an operation now.

214
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,502
Doc, what is that?

215
00:18:23,569 --> 00:18:24,903
Where are you taking that?

216
00:18:25,971 --> 00:18:27,906
My brother is wounded. He just called me.

217
00:18:27,973 --> 00:18:29,274
I need to go to him.

218
00:18:29,341 --> 00:18:31,276
You're going to your brother?

219
00:18:31,343 --> 00:18:32,511
Have you gone mad?

220
00:18:34,346 --> 00:18:35,714
No, Doc, you can't leave.

221
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:36,615
I won't allow you.

222
00:18:36,682 --> 00:18:38,584
Hazel, I have no choice, okay?

223
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:40,052
I need to treat him.

224
00:18:40,586 --> 00:18:41,553
That's my duty.

225
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:43,822
That is our duty as doctors.

226
00:18:43,889 --> 00:18:46,558
What if Captain Lucas finds out
about this?

227
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:49,294
I'm sure it will be a big problem.

228
00:18:49,361 --> 00:18:53,365
Hazel, my brother needs me, okay?

229
00:18:53,432 --> 00:18:55,100
I hope you understand.

230
00:19:29,601 --> 00:19:30,469
My child.

231
00:19:32,604 --> 00:19:33,639
Moira.

232
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:45,184
You've been here since last night.

233
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:51,089
Why don't you go sleep in
the room so you could rest?

234
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:55,260
I want to be here
when Diego wakes up.

235
00:19:59,831 --> 00:20:01,900
You did a remarkable thing last night.

236
00:20:03,268 --> 00:20:05,270
Even though you two are going
through a rough patch,

237
00:20:06,104 --> 00:20:08,273
you didn't let yourself be
carried away by your emotions.

238
00:20:09,074 --> 00:20:12,844
You even helped
in his operation.

239
00:20:15,814 --> 00:20:18,350
This has nothing to do with my
feelings for him.

240
00:20:44,376 --> 00:20:46,712
He risked his life to save me back then.

241
00:20:57,422 --> 00:20:58,657
I'll just leave you here.

242
00:21:11,903 --> 00:21:13,939
I'm sorry I got mad at you.

243
00:21:17,843 --> 00:21:20,912
I know you never wanted
to hurt Diego's mom.

244
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:25,083
I'm the one who should apologize
to you, my child.

245
00:21:30,656 --> 00:21:32,891
I thought I was doing what's best for you

246
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:36,028
but I ended up hurting you even more.

247
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:40,332
I hope you can forgive me.

248
00:22:15,067 --> 00:22:17,569
It's a good thing your wounds
were treated right away.

249
00:22:17,636 --> 00:22:19,604
You almost ran out of blood, Rodel.

250
00:22:21,673 --> 00:22:23,842
I thought you wouldn't come.

251
00:22:25,043 --> 00:22:26,411
You know I can't do that.

252
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:28,580
Didn't I tell you?

253
00:22:29,614 --> 00:22:30,849
I won't abandon you.

254
00:22:31,249 --> 00:22:33,318
Are you sure the soldiers didn't
follow you?

255
00:22:34,419 --> 00:22:35,687
Maybe you are wired.

256
00:22:35,754 --> 00:22:36,788
Of course not.

257
00:22:37,322 --> 00:22:39,191
Brother, I'm not like you.

258
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:42,861
I can't put other people in danger.

259
00:22:42,928 --> 00:22:44,363
I know.

260
00:22:45,497 --> 00:22:47,866
You don't want me to take
revenge on those soldiers.

261
00:22:49,835 --> 00:22:51,269
But as long as I live,

262
00:22:51,336 --> 00:22:54,239
I will make them pay for what they
did to Janet and to my child.

263
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:57,142
Brother, until when will you be like that?

264
00:22:57,976 --> 00:23:00,245
I know you're angry. I understand.

265
00:23:01,279 --> 00:23:03,281
I know it hurts to lose a loved one.

266
00:23:03,348 --> 00:23:08,220
But can any of your actions bring back
the lives of your wife and child?

267
00:23:08,286 --> 00:23:09,454
No.

268
00:23:09,888 --> 00:23:11,456
But it will lessen my anger.

269
00:23:12,324 --> 00:23:14,493
Until when will your anger last?

270
00:23:15,861 --> 00:23:17,929
Maxine, you won't understand.

271
00:23:21,133 --> 00:23:23,201
PRG still has a lot of plans.

272
00:23:24,336 --> 00:23:26,171
We still have a lot
of things to do.

273
00:23:28,673 --> 00:23:29,574
What?

274
00:23:32,244 --> 00:23:34,713
You'll understand if you join us.

275
00:23:36,348 --> 00:23:38,683
Rodel, you know I can't do that.

276
00:23:41,653 --> 00:23:43,155
Let's just talk about it later.

277
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:54,132
Nurse Hazel.

278
00:23:59,438 --> 00:24:04,009
I've been calling Doc Maxine
but I can't seem to contact her.

279
00:24:04,075 --> 00:24:05,544
I also can't find her.

280
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:07,879
Have you seen her?

281
00:24:09,214 --> 00:24:11,550
Why don't we tell Captain Lucas?

282
00:24:11,616 --> 00:24:13,552
We need to stop your brother.

283
00:24:13,618 --> 00:24:15,854
You saw what he did earlier.

284
00:24:15,921 --> 00:24:17,456
I don't want him to hurt himself.

285
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:20,358
Lucas can't find out about this.

286
00:24:20,425 --> 00:24:22,894
What if innocent people get hurt?

287
00:24:22,961 --> 00:24:24,529
Hazel! Can you please give me some time?

288
00:24:24,596 --> 00:24:26,498
I'll fix it. Promise!

289
00:24:27,365 --> 00:24:28,967
I don't know.

290
00:24:29,034 --> 00:24:29,935
I'm sorry.

291
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:35,807
Are you okay?

292
00:24:36,541 --> 00:24:37,943
I'm sorry…

293
00:24:38,577 --> 00:24:40,645
I'm not good at lying.

294
00:24:41,046 --> 00:24:43,482
I wasn't raised by my parents to lie.

295
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:47,886
Okay, what's the problem?

296
00:24:49,788 --> 00:24:53,692
Captain Lucas, there's something
I need to tell you.

297
00:24:58,897 --> 00:25:00,532
Doc Maxine left.

298
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:02,534
She left?

299
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:06,104
Where did she go?

300
00:25:06,771 --> 00:25:08,573
She went to…

301
00:25:09,641 --> 00:25:10,542
To?

302
00:25:11,877 --> 00:25:14,012
Where did Maxine go?

303
00:25:14,079 --> 00:25:16,214
She went to the PRG camp.

304
00:25:19,117 --> 00:25:20,185
What?

305
00:25:45,610 --> 00:25:47,312
Did you watch over me the whole time?

306
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:49,681
I just want to make sure
that you'll be okay.

307
00:25:53,184 --> 00:25:55,153
Why did you disobey my order?

308
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:57,022
Do you know the repercussions
of what you did?

309
00:25:57,088 --> 00:25:58,924
Snoopy has no fault in this, sir.

310
00:25:58,990 --> 00:26:00,225
I'm the one who ordered him.

311
00:26:00,292 --> 00:26:02,961
I will accept whatever the
consequences of my actions are.

312
00:26:03,028 --> 00:26:05,997
We're going to attack.
You need to prepare the troops.

313
00:26:06,064 --> 00:26:08,066
We need to plan our actions well.

314
00:26:08,133 --> 00:26:10,969
You're going to tell me
where the PRG camp is.

315
00:26:11,036 --> 00:26:12,904
We have another camp
that you don't know about.

316
00:26:12,971 --> 00:26:15,140
Our comrades are probably there.
