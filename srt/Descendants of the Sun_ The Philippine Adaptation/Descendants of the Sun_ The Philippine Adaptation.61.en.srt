1
00:00:11,244 --> 00:00:14,547
If I can't be of help the way
you want me to,

2
00:00:14,614 --> 00:00:16,716
it's better if I just leave Urdan.

3
00:00:16,783 --> 00:00:19,085
And so, I agree so there will be
no more trouble.

4
00:00:19,152 --> 00:00:21,221
Pack your things and you leave tomorrow.

5
00:00:21,287 --> 00:00:24,557
There's something I need to tell you.

6
00:00:24,624 --> 00:00:27,093
Even though you are no longer
the same older brother

7
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:31,531
who took care of me before,
I will protect you.

8
00:00:31,598 --> 00:00:36,336
I can never put you in harm's way
so I'll just leave Urdan.

9
00:00:36,403 --> 00:00:38,705
So, the doctor turns out to be a VIP.

10
00:00:38,772 --> 00:00:40,573
Find out when she is leaving.

11
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:43,209
You won't be seeing me
for a long time.

12
00:00:43,276 --> 00:00:46,446
I'm the only one making
your situation difficult.

13
00:00:46,513 --> 00:00:48,448
And if I leave Urdan,

14
00:00:48,515 --> 00:00:50,417
you have more chances to be happy.

15
00:00:50,483 --> 00:00:52,719
For our peace of our mind.

16
00:00:52,786 --> 00:00:54,621
I can no longer take you to the airport.

17
00:00:54,687 --> 00:00:56,756
Tamayo will accompany you.

18
00:00:56,823 --> 00:01:00,427
You said I should respect
your decision.

19
00:01:00,493 --> 00:01:01,895
You should be the one to return this.

20
00:01:01,961 --> 00:01:04,097
It looks like I won't go back
to that place anymore.

21
00:01:04,164 --> 00:01:05,532
Goodbye, Lucas.

22
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:09,936
Harry Potter, this is Big Boss.

23
00:01:11,671 --> 00:01:15,809
We're on our way out of Barangay Maligaya.
We'll be at the airport in ten minutes.

24
00:01:15,875 --> 00:01:18,878
-A vehicle is coming.
-Pistol, that's the target.

25
00:01:21,281 --> 00:01:23,283
I can't contact Tamayo.

26
00:01:23,349 --> 00:01:24,517
Big Boss.

27
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:27,153
-Harry Potter.
-We were ambushed.

28
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:29,422
Big Boss, I'm sorry.
We made Doc Maxine run.

29
00:01:29,489 --> 00:01:31,925
Where is Maxine? Where did she go?

30
00:01:45,672 --> 00:01:49,075
Pistol's group is getting bolder
to plan an attack on us.

31
00:01:49,142 --> 00:01:50,944
Good thing you're safe.

32
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:52,745
We should move to another camp.

33
00:01:52,812 --> 00:01:55,849
We will have a hard time fighting
while you are still wounded.

34
00:02:16,836 --> 00:02:17,937
What is it, Bullet?

35
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:22,475
Let me go!

36
00:02:22,542 --> 00:02:25,211
Hey, let me go!

37
00:02:32,385 --> 00:02:33,520
Shut up!

38
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:37,757
Bullet.

39
00:02:38,691 --> 00:02:39,959
Pistol!

40
00:02:42,195 --> 00:02:43,530
I said let me go!

41
00:02:47,233 --> 00:02:49,702
I said shut up!

42
00:02:51,571 --> 00:02:53,473
You animal!
Don't drag my sister into this!

43
00:02:55,074 --> 00:02:57,810
You are not in a position to make demands.

44
00:02:58,611 --> 00:03:00,813
So, you will do whatever I say.

45
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:03,183
Damn you!

46
00:03:04,884 --> 00:03:06,386
You taught me well.

47
00:03:07,654 --> 00:03:08,688
Shut up!

48
00:03:10,456 --> 00:03:12,258
<i>I will text you the location
where you should go.</i>

49
00:03:12,825 --> 00:03:14,060
Be there at seven o'clock.

50
00:03:14,127 --> 00:03:15,762
Don't bring anyone.

51
00:03:15,828 --> 00:03:20,166
I have a mole in your camp,
so you can't fool me.

52
00:03:23,336 --> 00:03:25,305
Fine, I'll be there.

53
00:03:29,275 --> 00:03:30,643
Don't worry, Bullet.

54
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:33,646
It will just be a quick exchange.

55
00:03:34,647 --> 00:03:39,452
Your head for your sister's head.

56
00:04:38,478 --> 00:04:39,479
Big Boss.

57
00:04:40,346 --> 00:04:44,017
This is the information about the PRG
that we got from our informant.

58
00:04:45,018 --> 00:04:46,819
Can you recognize any of them?

59
00:04:56,696 --> 00:04:57,764
That's them.

60
00:04:59,932 --> 00:05:00,767
What's that?

61
00:05:02,435 --> 00:05:04,237
They were the ones
who attacked us.

62
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:05,638
Confirmed.

63
00:05:07,106 --> 00:05:08,074
It's Greg.

64
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:23,156
Do you know anything about
the PRG movement here?

65
00:05:23,222 --> 00:05:25,892
All I can say is be careful.

66
00:05:26,859 --> 00:05:27,927
He's really an animal.

67
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:30,530
He should've let Maxine return to Manila.

68
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:33,533
Big Boss! Big Boss!

69
00:05:33,599 --> 00:05:35,902
-Just a second. We're talking here.
-I'm sorry.

70
00:05:41,741 --> 00:05:42,809
Where did you get this?

71
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:45,411
Our fellow soldiers found this
at the gate.

72
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:00,293
You're really going, Bullet?

73
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:03,863
You're at a disadvantage.
You're not well yet.

74
00:06:04,964 --> 00:06:07,266
I can't let him hurt my sister.

75
00:06:11,904 --> 00:06:17,610
Whoever among you is the traitor,
tell your boss that I'm coming for him.

76
00:06:20,146 --> 00:06:23,983
After I kill Pistol,
I'll be back here to kill you!

77
00:07:08,394 --> 00:07:10,263
Your visitors are coming.

78
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:14,400
Get her ready.

79
00:07:15,535 --> 00:07:16,502
Take her.

80
00:07:20,339 --> 00:07:21,541
Get up.

81
00:07:30,183 --> 00:07:31,818
It's showtime.

82
00:07:33,553 --> 00:07:35,354
Everyone will see…

83
00:07:36,756 --> 00:07:41,260
including the PRG and the soldiers,
who is he strongest.

84
00:09:34,674 --> 00:09:35,775
Move!

85
00:09:56,762 --> 00:09:57,897
Let's move.

86
00:10:32,064 --> 00:10:33,232
Where is Maxine?

87
00:10:34,934 --> 00:10:36,535
Bring her out.

88
00:10:36,602 --> 00:10:38,738
I did not take Maxine.

89
00:10:38,804 --> 00:10:41,374
Don't fool me. Your men took her.

90
00:10:49,582 --> 00:10:51,117
Those are my former men.

91
00:10:51,951 --> 00:10:53,486
It's Rifle and Pistol.

92
00:10:55,054 --> 00:10:58,024
They hate me and want revenge.
That's why they took Maxine.

93
00:10:59,959 --> 00:11:02,728
If you are here to save my sister…

94
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:07,533
it means we are on the same side.

95
00:11:18,644 --> 00:11:19,745
Hey!

96
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:23,149
Careful with your next move.

97
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:26,252
This is as fragile as a crystal.

98
00:11:46,772 --> 00:11:48,074
You are an animal, Greg!

99
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:49,208
Oops!

100
00:11:50,776 --> 00:11:52,745
I said be careful.

101
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:55,181
Because if I drop this…

102
00:11:56,282 --> 00:11:57,149
Boom!

103
00:11:58,017 --> 00:11:59,351
We will all explode.

104
00:12:00,953 --> 00:12:03,789
And your sister will be the first victim.

105
00:12:07,193 --> 00:12:08,060
Don't.

106
00:12:08,127 --> 00:12:09,762
Don't. Just don't.

107
00:12:10,763 --> 00:12:11,964
Just do as he says.

108
00:12:17,036 --> 00:12:18,471
Don't tell me you're scared?

109
00:12:18,537 --> 00:12:19,705
He's alone.

110
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:21,907
That's what you think.

111
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:38,023
Take care of them.

112
00:12:44,497 --> 00:12:45,464
Maxine!

113
00:12:51,137 --> 00:12:52,471
Wolf, cover me.

114
00:12:52,538 --> 00:12:54,039
Alpha Team, let's cover!

115
00:13:18,898 --> 00:13:20,332
Where are you taking me?

116
00:13:47,059 --> 00:13:49,195
Big Boss, this is Snoopy.

117
00:13:50,095 --> 00:13:51,497
I'm right behind you. Seven o'clock.

118
00:13:54,567 --> 00:13:56,268
Do you see the thing attached
to her?

119
00:13:57,369 --> 00:13:58,704
Let go of me!

120
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:06,445
That kind of bomb
has a wireless transmitter

121
00:14:07,079 --> 00:14:08,747
<i>that is connected to a detonator.</i>

122
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:11,650
We need to find it.

123
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:14,420
What now, buddy?

124
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,690
Are your men reporting casualties?

125
00:14:18,557 --> 00:14:20,125
Is there anyone left of the Alpha Team?

126
00:14:21,493 --> 00:14:22,828
Let go of me!

127
00:14:23,796 --> 00:14:28,167
Big Boss, the transmitter
is on Doc Maxine's right shoulder.

128
00:14:28,968 --> 00:14:31,237
Once it's destroyed,
the detonator will be useless.

129
00:14:32,471 --> 00:14:33,772
Are you sure?

130
00:14:44,817 --> 00:14:47,019
You might say I have no heart.

131
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:55,895
Hug her if you want,
so you will die together.

132
00:14:56,495 --> 00:14:59,665
Maxine, you trust me, right?

133
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:02,868
What are you talking about, Lucas?

134
00:15:02,935 --> 00:15:04,603
Stay still.

135
00:15:06,305 --> 00:15:07,706
-Lucas?
-Don't move.

136
00:15:08,807 --> 00:15:10,476
You know that I will never hurt you.

137
00:15:23,155 --> 00:15:24,423
Run!

138
00:15:32,498 --> 00:15:33,465
Lucas!

139
00:16:00,993 --> 00:16:01,961
Snoopy.

140
00:16:02,027 --> 00:16:04,296
-Big Boss.
-Snoopy, go with Maxine.

141
00:16:06,398 --> 00:16:08,467
Lucas, where are you going?

142
00:16:09,168 --> 00:16:12,438
Maxine, Snoopy is the best bomb expert
in the military.

143
00:16:13,038 --> 00:16:14,073
I'll be back for you.

144
00:16:15,174 --> 00:16:16,442
Lucas.

145
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:23,649
Doc, just relax. This will be quick.

146
00:16:59,284 --> 00:17:01,320
Snoopy, won't this explode anymore?

147
00:17:01,387 --> 00:17:04,590
Doc, I will not let it explode.

148
00:17:06,392 --> 00:17:08,193
My life also depends on it.

149
00:17:10,162 --> 00:17:11,096
And besides…

150
00:17:12,164 --> 00:17:14,199
A lot of patients still need you.

151
00:17:16,635 --> 00:17:18,170
That's why I need to save you.

152
00:17:21,073 --> 00:17:22,408
Am I going to die?

153
00:17:23,942 --> 00:17:25,911
You're suddenly nice to me.

154
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:27,980
You will not die.

155
00:17:28,647 --> 00:17:30,416
Big Boss and the Alpha Team got you.

156
00:17:31,483 --> 00:17:32,785
Don't worry.

157
00:17:57,276 --> 00:17:58,343
Cover!

158
00:18:05,851 --> 00:18:07,853
This is just the beginning, Alpha Team.

159
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:22,267
Why are you so angry, buddy?

160
00:18:30,876 --> 00:18:31,743
You're safe now.

161
00:18:33,011 --> 00:18:36,748
How about you? The Alpha Team?
Lucas and Diego, where are they?

162
00:18:37,349 --> 00:18:40,419
They are strong. Don't worry about them.

163
00:18:43,021 --> 00:18:44,756
You really are a traitor, Greg.

164
00:18:45,891 --> 00:18:50,429
Not only to our sworn duty,
but also to our friendship.

165
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:53,398
Buddy, get down!

166
00:18:56,835 --> 00:18:58,337
Medic! Medic!

167
00:18:59,771 --> 00:19:04,943
Buddy, tell my family
that I love them so much.

168
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:06,645
I won't be your messenger.

169
00:19:06,712 --> 00:19:09,281
You will tell them that yourself
once you get out of here.

170
00:19:10,782 --> 00:19:12,351
Are you here because of the PRG?

171
00:19:12,417 --> 00:19:14,319
I also avoid them.

172
00:19:14,386 --> 00:19:16,588
My business is affected.

173
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:17,990
They're such a nuisance.

174
00:19:18,056 --> 00:19:21,393
Do you know any of them?

175
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:23,729
Don't involve me in that, buddy.

176
00:19:23,795 --> 00:19:24,963
I'm a civilian now.

177
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:27,533
I don't want to get involved.

178
00:19:30,802 --> 00:19:34,573
I know you were with Bullet
when you kidnapped my father.

179
00:19:35,107 --> 00:19:36,475
You tortured him.

180
00:19:37,976 --> 00:19:39,378
You crippled him.

181
00:19:39,444 --> 00:19:42,314
-You almost killed him, you animal.
-Hey, take it easy.

182
00:19:43,549 --> 00:19:44,783
I was there…

183
00:19:46,218 --> 00:19:48,487
but I couldn't stop Bullet.

184
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:51,190
His anger towards your father
was very personal to him.

185
00:19:51,256 --> 00:19:52,958
There was nothing I could have done.

186
00:20:05,003 --> 00:20:08,073
It doesn't matter.
We got our revenge, right?

187
00:20:09,074 --> 00:20:12,077
His sister, the doctor,
already exploded.

188
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:14,580
That's where you're wrong.

189
00:20:16,114 --> 00:20:17,282
Maxine is safe.

190
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:20,886
She's with the best bomb expert
in the army.

191
00:20:24,423 --> 00:20:25,791
What happened to you, Greg?

192
00:20:27,793 --> 00:20:29,761
Why did you give up being a soldier?

193
00:20:30,829 --> 00:20:34,199
Buddy, not everyone can do
what you're doing.

194
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:37,936
You are risking your life
for a meager income.

195
00:20:39,705 --> 00:20:45,844
If I were to risk my life,
the returns should be worth it.

196
00:20:46,812 --> 00:20:52,284
You can no longer use that money
because you will rot in jail.

197
00:20:53,719 --> 00:20:55,587
So if I were you, just surrender.

198
00:20:56,955 --> 00:20:59,258
You can still change.

199
00:20:59,324 --> 00:21:00,459
Change?

200
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:03,028
I will not change anything.

201
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:07,232
I'd rather die than surrender.

202
00:21:16,975 --> 00:21:18,010
Don't!

203
00:21:47,172 --> 00:21:48,273
Buddy.

204
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:51,343
It doesn't have to end this way.

205
00:21:53,445 --> 00:21:54,613
I know you.

206
00:21:56,348 --> 00:21:57,949
You can still change.

207
00:22:01,086 --> 00:22:01,920
Buddy.

208
00:22:03,855 --> 00:22:06,024
You don't really know me.

209
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:10,729
Maybe this is who I really am.

210
00:22:12,764 --> 00:22:14,766
I have no regrets.

211
00:22:52,738 --> 00:22:53,739
Just surrender!

212
00:22:54,272 --> 00:22:55,807
You're all by yourself.

213
00:22:56,842 --> 00:23:00,712
Pistol and I will make sure
that you will all die tonight!

214
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:28,106
Do you know where my brother is?

215
00:23:31,143 --> 00:23:33,612
-Let go of my sister!
-Rodel! Snoopy!

216
00:23:43,021 --> 00:23:44,222
Maxine, let's go!

217
00:23:54,566 --> 00:23:55,700
Bullet took Maxine.

218
00:23:56,101 --> 00:23:58,203
<i>I repeat, Bullet took Maxine.</i>

219
00:24:03,008 --> 00:24:08,213
Brother. Brother, enough. Let me go.
I don't want to go with you.

220
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,815
-Brother!
-Bullet!

221
00:24:11,483 --> 00:24:12,818
Let Maxine go.

222
00:24:13,585 --> 00:24:16,455
If she doesn't want to go with you,
let her go.

223
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:53,258
You better surrender!

224
00:24:53,859 --> 00:24:56,161
Whatever you and your boss are planning
is not gonna happen!

225
00:24:56,228 --> 00:24:57,062
It's over!

226
00:24:57,128 --> 00:24:58,463
Pistol is already dead.

227
00:25:09,774 --> 00:25:11,543
Big Boss, run!
