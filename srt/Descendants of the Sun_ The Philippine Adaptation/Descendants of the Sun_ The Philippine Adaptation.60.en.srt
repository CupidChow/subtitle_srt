1
00:00:11,644 --> 00:00:14,481
You probably know that Colonel Garcia
wants me to be an asset

2
00:00:14,547 --> 00:00:16,516
against the PRG and my brother, right?

3
00:00:16,583 --> 00:00:18,885
They asked me to talk to you.

4
00:00:18,952 --> 00:00:22,122
You mean they want me
to betray my brother?

5
00:00:22,188 --> 00:00:25,425
No matter what I decide to do,
I will end up losing.

6
00:00:25,492 --> 00:00:28,428
<i>Whatever choice I make,
I will hurt someone.</i>

7
00:00:28,495 --> 00:00:30,330
No matter what Maxine's decision is,

8
00:00:30,397 --> 00:00:32,732
the operation against the rebels
will continue.

9
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:35,468
I already thought about it,
I'm thinking of asking for a reassignment

10
00:00:35,535 --> 00:00:37,871
so I would not be involved
in the operations here in Urdan.

11
00:00:38,538 --> 00:00:39,906
It's a conflict of interest.

12
00:00:39,973 --> 00:00:42,742
Your relationship with Maxine
is more important…

13
00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:44,811
than your sworn duty?

14
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:47,614
Can't you see that
what's happening to them is similar

15
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,115
to what we have been through?

16
00:00:49,182 --> 00:00:51,718
Lucas, can we talk?

17
00:00:52,285 --> 00:00:54,721
<i>I'm not agreeing to be a military asset.</i>

18
00:00:54,788 --> 00:00:56,423
I can't do that to my brother.

19
00:00:56,489 --> 00:00:57,924
I understand that.

20
00:00:57,991 --> 00:01:00,193
I don't want you to be conflicted
because of me.

21
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:01,728
It will just be harder for you.

22
00:01:01,795 --> 00:01:04,130
It is better if we break up.

23
00:01:04,197 --> 00:01:06,032
Maxine, let's not give up.

24
00:01:06,099 --> 00:01:09,335
I don't want us to get to a point
where we can't stand each other.

25
00:01:09,402 --> 00:01:11,538
<i>And you and my brother
are at war with each other.</i>

26
00:01:11,604 --> 00:01:13,640
I have made my decision, Lucas.

27
00:01:13,706 --> 00:01:15,942
I hope you can respect my decision.

28
00:02:01,387 --> 00:02:04,657
If I can't help in the way you want me to…

29
00:02:06,226 --> 00:02:08,328
it would be better if I just leave Urdan.

30
00:02:08,928 --> 00:02:10,563
You're really unbelievable.

31
00:02:11,231 --> 00:02:13,032
You already have an exit plan.

32
00:02:14,434 --> 00:02:16,202
I thought you talked to your girlfriend?

33
00:02:17,237 --> 00:02:18,771
You made her understand…

34
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:24,811
that her cooperation is important
in our operation.

35
00:02:25,578 --> 00:02:26,746
Garcia, that's enough.

36
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:29,916
I can't influence the decision
of Dr. Dela Cruz.

37
00:02:32,218 --> 00:02:33,853
She has a mind of her own.

38
00:02:34,888 --> 00:02:36,823
And we can't force her to do anything.

39
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:41,895
Lucas is right.

40
00:02:50,136 --> 00:02:53,940
You should leave Urdan
so there will be no more trouble.

41
00:02:55,208 --> 00:02:58,211
Pack your things, you leave tomorrow.

42
00:03:04,951 --> 00:03:05,952
Go ahead.

43
00:03:31,144 --> 00:03:34,447
I wonder what Doc Maxine's decision is.

44
00:03:36,082 --> 00:03:38,051
It seems she and Big Boss are not okay.

45
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:44,490
I can see in their body language
when I saw them talking earlier.

46
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:47,860
Is it similar to your body language
when my dad is around?

47
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:53,766
Diego, I see you.

48
00:03:54,701 --> 00:03:58,071
You get tensed when he is around.

49
00:03:59,005 --> 00:04:00,240
You are still mad.

50
00:04:01,841 --> 00:04:05,178
I don't know what to do
when you cross each other's paths.

51
00:04:11,517 --> 00:04:13,019
Sorry if I hurt you.

52
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:19,058
It's not that easy for me to forget
what happened to my mother.

53
00:04:22,629 --> 00:04:23,863
I know that.

54
00:04:25,798 --> 00:04:28,468
I understand, but, Diego.

55
00:04:28,534 --> 00:04:30,770
How about us?
Are we going to stay this way?

56
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,415
I need to talk to the both of you.

57
00:05:41,274 --> 00:05:42,475
Hello, Maxine?

58
00:05:42,542 --> 00:05:43,543
Rodel.

59
00:06:25,118 --> 00:06:26,285
Why are you calling?

60
00:06:26,753 --> 00:06:28,755
Did your soldier boyfriend hurt you?

61
00:06:31,324 --> 00:06:32,358
No, Rodel.

62
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:36,763
I just need to tell you something.

63
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:43,302
I already told Mom that we met.

64
00:06:45,872 --> 00:06:47,039
<i>She cried a lot.</i>

65
00:06:47,974 --> 00:06:49,475
<i>She said she wants to see you.</i>

66
00:06:51,978 --> 00:06:55,148
It will only happen
if you come back to us.

67
00:06:57,483 --> 00:06:59,819
I'm glad we met again,

68
00:06:59,886 --> 00:07:01,554
even though you've changed.

69
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:07,059
Even though you are no longer
my older brother, Rodel,

70
00:07:07,693 --> 00:07:09,762
who took care of me before.

71
00:07:12,698 --> 00:07:14,667
I just want you to know that…

72
00:07:16,202 --> 00:07:17,603
I will protect you.

73
00:07:19,405 --> 00:07:20,807
And I love you so much.

74
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:26,446
I can never put you in harm's way, so…

75
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:30,116
I'm leaving Urdan.

76
00:07:32,585 --> 00:07:33,820
Maxine, hold on!

77
00:07:34,821 --> 00:07:37,523
I will do this because I still want us
to be together again.

78
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:41,794
I believe you can still choose family…

79
00:07:43,429 --> 00:07:44,997
over vengeance.

80
00:07:46,165 --> 00:07:48,034
I would like to see you again.

81
00:07:48,634 --> 00:07:49,635
I hope…

82
00:07:50,636 --> 00:07:53,506
I hope it won't be in secret anymore.

83
00:07:56,776 --> 00:07:58,377
I'm leaving tomorrow, Rodel.

84
00:08:01,948 --> 00:08:03,449
Take care of yourself, okay?

85
00:08:09,422 --> 00:08:10,590
Goodbye, brother.

86
00:08:24,804 --> 00:08:26,172
What's the matter, Bullet?

87
00:08:26,806 --> 00:08:28,307
What did your sister say?

88
00:09:16,355 --> 00:09:18,124
Are you going back to the base?

89
00:09:22,128 --> 00:09:25,865
And definitely,
you won't be seeing me for a long time.

90
00:09:29,435 --> 00:09:32,672
I'm the only one
who's making your situation difficult.

91
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:38,578
And if I leave Urdan,
you have more chances to be happy.

92
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:53,559
I really regret that I hurt your mother.

93
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:10,009
I love you so much, my child.

94
00:10:15,681 --> 00:10:19,352
Even if that means
I will have to leave you here…

95
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:33,633
For the peace of all of our minds.

96
00:10:43,242 --> 00:10:44,510
You take care.

97
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:08,134
We know that the people of Urdan
need doctors.

98
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,503
-But what…
-That was too dangerous.

99
00:11:11,737 --> 00:11:13,039
That's exactly it, Dad.

100
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:16,709
You're being overprotective
is affecting my job.

101
00:11:16,776 --> 00:11:18,377
I can't do it properly.

102
00:11:18,444 --> 00:11:20,012
Remember this.

103
00:11:21,147 --> 00:11:23,783
Even if a lot of things change
in your life…

104
00:11:24,784 --> 00:11:26,752
you will always be my little girl.

105
00:11:26,819 --> 00:11:28,354
I love you so much.

106
00:11:28,888 --> 00:11:31,724
I'm always here to support you.

107
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:33,125
Why are you talking about that?

108
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:41,934
How could you hurt her like that?

109
00:11:45,504 --> 00:11:46,906
What I did was not easy.

110
00:11:50,409 --> 00:11:51,911
And I chose you.

111
00:11:52,678 --> 00:11:54,513
That's why even from the start,

112
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:57,183
you were already against my relationship
with Diego.

113
00:11:58,617 --> 00:11:59,652
Yes.

114
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:04,390
Because I was scared
you'd find out the truth.

115
00:12:09,695 --> 00:12:11,063
But in doing so…

116
00:12:13,466 --> 00:12:15,134
I've hurt you even more.

117
00:12:18,037 --> 00:12:19,739
I'm sorry if I got mad at you.

118
00:12:19,805 --> 00:12:22,441
I know you never wanted
to hurt Diego's mom.

119
00:12:22,508 --> 00:12:24,643
I'm the one who should apologize to you.

120
00:12:26,212 --> 00:12:28,114
I hope you can forgive me.

121
00:13:04,416 --> 00:13:05,417
Good.

122
00:13:07,353 --> 00:13:11,123
Keep working on that while I think
about who our first target will be.

123
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:14,760
Will it be Bullet?

124
00:13:16,362 --> 00:13:17,563
Or the military?

125
00:13:23,435 --> 00:13:24,837
We have some information.

126
00:13:33,913 --> 00:13:35,815
So, the doctor turns out to be a VIP.

127
00:13:38,617 --> 00:13:40,386
Find out when she's leaving.

128
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,322
I've been looking for you.

129
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:22,294
I already said goodbye
to the medical team,

130
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:24,630
to the military team, to Biboy.

131
00:14:25,898 --> 00:14:27,867
To Mrs. Sheila and to Mr. Norman.

132
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:30,736
I'm leaving soon.

133
00:14:34,406 --> 00:14:35,407
I know.

134
00:14:42,781 --> 00:14:44,516
I can't take you to the airport.

135
00:14:46,619 --> 00:14:48,487
I've assigned Tamayo to go with you.

136
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:57,596
You said you wanted me
to respect your decision.

137
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:02,468
If I come send you off…

138
00:15:04,837 --> 00:15:06,272
I won't be able to do that.

139
00:15:08,507 --> 00:15:09,875
I might stop you.

140
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:16,582
I might force you
to change your mind about us.

141
00:15:49,381 --> 00:15:51,550
We can say our goodbyes here.

142
00:16:00,225 --> 00:16:02,127
Are you still really leaving, Maxine?

143
00:16:02,761 --> 00:16:04,396
Will you really stay away from me?

144
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:07,366
I don't know what will happen to us.

145
00:16:07,433 --> 00:16:13,505
I feel like my heart will explode
if I continue with this.

146
00:16:15,908 --> 00:16:17,509
I will always be scared.

147
00:16:18,444 --> 00:16:20,012
I will always worry.

148
00:16:22,081 --> 00:16:25,751
You know, it's best if I just avoid it.

149
00:16:27,353 --> 00:16:29,388
I will just go back to my old life.

150
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:35,427
There are many reasons
for me to leave, right?

151
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:41,133
But there's one reason
that's stopping me from doing that.

152
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:48,240
Fine, it's okay.

153
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:53,612
It doesn't matter if it's difficult,
complicated, or scary.

154
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:56,081
At least I will have no regrets.

155
00:16:57,316 --> 00:16:59,685
I will not regret that I did not tell you.

156
00:17:02,388 --> 00:17:03,789
I love you, Lucas.

157
00:17:32,618 --> 00:17:33,886
You kept it.

158
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:40,726
If it's special to you,

159
00:17:42,694 --> 00:17:44,229
you take good care of it.

160
00:17:46,598 --> 00:17:48,300
You should return this.

161
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:54,506
It looks like I won't be able to go back
to that place anymore.

162
00:17:58,977 --> 00:18:01,180
Think of me when you're there.

163
00:18:06,885 --> 00:18:08,387
Don't be too angry.

164
00:18:37,883 --> 00:18:38,984
I don't want it.

165
00:19:00,772 --> 00:19:02,040
Goodbye, Lucas.

166
00:19:39,778 --> 00:19:43,215
At least I was able to say goodbye
to my dad before he left.

167
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:45,184
Are you mad at me?

168
00:19:47,219 --> 00:19:50,622
Do you think I'm taking you away from him?

169
00:19:52,991 --> 00:19:55,394
I know you will never do that, Diego.

170
00:19:55,961 --> 00:20:00,632
I know that you will endure
the pain and anger you feel for my dad…

171
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:02,334
for me.

172
00:20:03,669 --> 00:20:04,836
But, Diego.

173
00:20:05,671 --> 00:20:07,406
You don't have to do that anymore.

174
00:20:08,307 --> 00:20:12,511
My dad himself chose to go
to give us a chance.

175
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:20,419
I still don't know
how I should feel about that.

176
00:20:23,322 --> 00:20:26,925
We should just be happy, Diego.
Let's not waste our chance.

177
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:44,276
Did Doc Maxine leave already?

178
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:47,446
I'm just monitoring Tamayo's location.

179
00:21:05,564 --> 00:21:07,899
We just got out of Barangay Maligaya.

180
00:21:07,966 --> 00:21:10,035
We'll be at the airport in ten minutes.

181
00:21:17,809 --> 00:21:20,579
-A vehicle is coming.
-Pistol, that's the target.

182
00:21:31,089 --> 00:21:31,923
What is that?

183
00:21:34,826 --> 00:21:36,328
Is someone shooting at us?

184
00:21:36,395 --> 00:21:38,263
They are shooting our tires.

185
00:21:40,065 --> 00:21:42,968
How about us?
What's going to happen, Harry Potter?

186
00:21:43,035 --> 00:21:44,436
Won't we be able to get out of here?

187
00:21:45,537 --> 00:21:48,073
Big Boss, we're being attacked.

188
00:21:58,183 --> 00:21:59,785
I can't contact Tamayo.

189
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:05,490
What happened to you?

190
00:22:06,792 --> 00:22:07,993
We were ambushed.

191
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:09,861
But I'm not sure if it's the PRG.

192
00:22:10,962 --> 00:22:13,632
Big Boss, I'm sorry.
We made Doc Maxine run away.

193
00:22:13,699 --> 00:22:15,267
Doc, run!

194
00:22:16,968 --> 00:22:19,137
We we're planning on following her,
but they shot us.

195
00:22:20,939 --> 00:22:21,940
They even went after me.

196
00:22:23,608 --> 00:22:24,743
But they later retreated.

197
00:22:26,144 --> 00:22:27,479
Where is Maxine?

198
00:22:28,046 --> 00:22:29,348
Where did she go?

199
00:22:50,802 --> 00:22:54,172
Pistol's group is getting bolder
to be planning an attack on us.

200
00:22:54,239 --> 00:22:57,876
Good thing nothing worse happened to you.
Maybe we should move to another camp.

201
00:22:57,943 --> 00:23:00,979
It will be hard for us to fight
while you are still wounded.

202
00:23:17,429 --> 00:23:18,630
What happened, Bullet?

203
00:23:23,201 --> 00:23:25,036
Let me go!

204
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:34,079
Shut up!

205
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:51,396
I said shut up!

206
00:23:53,532 --> 00:23:55,333
You animal! Don't involve my sister!

207
00:23:57,202 --> 00:23:59,838
Looks like you are in no position
to make demands.

208
00:24:00,605 --> 00:24:02,641
So you will do everything I say.

209
00:24:03,975 --> 00:24:05,143
You animal!

210
00:24:06,878 --> 00:24:08,213
I just learned from you.

211
00:24:09,581 --> 00:24:10,582
Shut up!

212
00:24:12,317 --> 00:24:14,186
<i>I will message you the place
where you'll go.</i>

213
00:24:14,719 --> 00:24:16,087
Later at 7:00.

214
00:24:16,154 --> 00:24:17,789
Don't bring anyone.

215
00:24:17,856 --> 00:24:22,093
I have a mole in your camp
so you can't fool me.

216
00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:27,199
Fine, I'll be there.

217
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:32,637
Don't worry, Bullet.

218
00:24:33,405 --> 00:24:35,507
It will just be a quick exchange.

219
00:24:36,575 --> 00:24:37,776
Your head…

220
00:24:39,344 --> 00:24:41,379
in exchange of your sister's head.

221
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:17,382
Your visitors are coming.

222
00:25:17,449 --> 00:25:20,619
This is the information we got
from our informant about the PRG.

223
00:25:20,685 --> 00:25:22,654
Maybe you can recognize who ambushed you?

224
00:25:22,721 --> 00:25:24,990
-They were the ones who attacked us.
-It's Greg.

225
00:25:25,056 --> 00:25:26,124
Where did you get this?

226
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:30,262
Whoever among you is the traitor,
tell your boss that I'm coming for him.

227
00:25:30,328 --> 00:25:34,232
After I kill Pistol,
I'm coming back here to kill you!

228
00:25:34,299 --> 00:25:37,235
Everyone will see,
the PRG and the military,

229
00:25:37,302 --> 00:25:39,571
who truly is stronger.

230
00:25:45,844 --> 00:25:47,112
Where is Maxine?

231
00:25:47,178 --> 00:25:48,713
I didn't take Maxine.

232
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:51,082
Now, if you are here to save my sister,

233
00:25:51,149 --> 00:25:53,351
it means we're going to be allies.

234
00:25:53,418 --> 00:25:54,586
Surrender now!

235
00:25:54,653 --> 00:25:57,489
Pistol and I will make sure
that you will all die tonight!

236
00:26:00,325 --> 00:26:02,027
<i>Be careful with your every move.</i>

237
00:26:02,761 --> 00:26:04,563
This is more fragile than crystal.
