1
00:00:10,944 --> 00:00:13,346
Big Boss, the area has been cleared.

2
00:00:13,413 --> 00:00:15,181
Bullet escaped.

3
00:00:15,248 --> 00:00:16,683
Is he the one who crippled your dad?

4
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:19,719
He did not only cripple my father.
He almost killed him.

5
00:00:19,786 --> 00:00:24,357
What if Bullet changes his ways
and asks for your forgiveness?

6
00:00:24,424 --> 00:00:25,892
Will you forgive him?

7
00:00:25,959 --> 00:00:29,195
The wound that he left on my family
was too deep.

8
00:00:29,262 --> 00:00:32,365
They are evil.

9
00:00:34,401 --> 00:00:35,835
I know that you're really mad at me.

10
00:00:35,902 --> 00:00:37,971
I can't undo what happened to your mother

11
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:40,106
and I will regret that
for the rest of my life.

12
00:00:40,173 --> 00:00:43,076
I understand if you cannot forgive me.

13
00:00:43,143 --> 00:00:48,415
But please, Moira should not be the one
paying for my sin.

14
00:00:48,481 --> 00:00:51,951
What if you found out
that Rodel is still alive?

15
00:00:52,018 --> 00:00:53,319
<i>Why do you ask?</i>

16
00:00:53,386 --> 00:00:55,855
<i>Don't be too hard on yourself.</i>

17
00:00:55,922 --> 00:00:59,626
<i>We have to accept
that your brother is gone.</i>

18
00:00:59,692 --> 00:01:01,327
Why do you think Bullet is wounded?

19
00:01:01,394 --> 00:01:04,130
Sir, we suspect that he got into a fight
with someone in their group.

20
00:01:04,197 --> 00:01:06,066
That only means there's a faction
in their group.

21
00:01:06,132 --> 00:01:08,535
Do you think Bullet left the PRG?

22
00:01:08,601 --> 00:01:11,137
We are not sure, sir but we will find out.

23
00:01:11,204 --> 00:01:15,508
We can easily bring them down
while they are having internal problems.

24
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:19,312
It looks like you're in a hurry.

25
00:01:19,379 --> 00:01:22,816
I'm going to Sitio Santos
to see Miss Sheila.

26
00:01:22,882 --> 00:01:24,584
I need to bring them some medicines.

27
00:01:24,651 --> 00:01:25,985
Do you want me to come with you?

28
00:01:26,052 --> 00:01:28,922
I'll just ask Nurse Hazel to do it.

29
00:01:28,988 --> 00:01:30,790
I just remembered.
I still have work to do.

30
00:01:59,819 --> 00:02:01,621
What are you doing here?

31
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:05,925
I just want to check your condition.

32
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:16,436
I thought you don't care about me anymore.

33
00:02:19,105 --> 00:02:20,773
You broke up with me, right?

34
00:02:26,846 --> 00:02:28,481
I thought you're brave…

35
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:34,921
but you can't even tell me
why you broke up with me.

36
00:02:40,026 --> 00:02:42,195
Diego, I don't need your apology.

37
00:02:44,931 --> 00:02:46,699
And I don't need you here.

38
00:02:48,434 --> 00:02:49,602
Get out.

39
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:51,804
Get out.

40
00:02:54,641 --> 00:02:56,276
Diego, get out.

41
00:02:57,977 --> 00:02:59,445
Get out, Diego.

42
00:03:00,547 --> 00:03:01,414
Help!

43
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:03,550
Help, medical team!

44
00:03:06,352 --> 00:03:07,620
Help! Help!

45
00:03:08,388 --> 00:03:09,689
She is fainting.

46
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:13,993
We'll take care of her, sir.

47
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:15,528
Will she be okay?

48
00:03:15,595 --> 00:03:17,197
We'll do everything.

49
00:03:27,907 --> 00:03:29,576
Her blood pressure is dropping.

50
00:03:38,318 --> 00:03:40,553
Where is Doc Maxine? We need her help.

51
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:43,022
Nurse Emma is already looking for her.
I'll follow her up.

52
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:45,758
Moira, my child.

53
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:58,104
Rodel?

54
00:04:05,511 --> 00:04:06,646
Brother?

55
00:04:24,497 --> 00:04:25,665
It's me, Maxine.

56
00:04:26,733 --> 00:04:30,236
Be quiet. Those traitors might hear us.
It's dangerous.

57
00:04:45,485 --> 00:04:48,488
Sir, how is Captain Moira?

58
00:04:55,428 --> 00:04:56,896
Is Doc Maxine here yet?

59
00:04:56,963 --> 00:05:00,333
Doc Earl, Doc Maxine is not in Medicube.

60
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,567
Where did she go?

61
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:03,569
I'll do it! I'll call her.

62
00:05:21,087 --> 00:05:23,456
Sir, I will look for Maxine.

63
00:05:23,523 --> 00:05:24,924
Yes, please, Lucas.

64
00:05:37,937 --> 00:05:39,739
I thought you're not going to come.

65
00:05:40,473 --> 00:05:42,975
Rodel, you're my brother.

66
00:05:44,077 --> 00:05:46,012
Of course I won't abandon you.

67
00:05:47,547 --> 00:05:48,548
Thank you.

68
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:51,551
But let me warn you.

69
00:05:52,618 --> 00:05:55,688
If you're here
to convince me to surrender,

70
00:05:55,755 --> 00:05:57,223
then you're wasting your time.

71
00:05:57,290 --> 00:05:59,892
I'm here to treat your wounds.

72
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:23,082
Moira, my child!

73
00:07:18,738 --> 00:07:20,339
Her circulation has returned.

74
00:07:33,853 --> 00:07:35,121
Thank you.

75
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:10,423
Where are you, Maxine? Where are you?

76
00:08:18,731 --> 00:08:19,932
Thank you.

77
00:08:23,936 --> 00:08:25,071
Brother.

78
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:29,075
You still haven't told me
why you went missing.

79
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:33,679
All these years, Mom and I
thought you're already dead.

80
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:37,483
We went crazy thinking about you.

81
00:08:40,753 --> 00:08:42,255
What really happened?

82
00:08:44,757 --> 00:08:46,259
It's a long story.

83
00:08:49,462 --> 00:08:52,632
Rodel, you owe me an explanation.

84
00:08:53,599 --> 00:08:56,936
Is that all you can say
after everything that happened?

85
00:08:57,003 --> 00:08:59,272
That it's a long story?

86
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:05,378
Fine, I'll tell you.

87
00:09:12,518 --> 00:09:14,353
When I was in the military,

88
00:09:15,421 --> 00:09:18,024
I fell in love with a PRG member, Janet.

89
00:09:19,425 --> 00:09:22,128
I was helping them get weapons.

90
00:09:22,194 --> 00:09:25,765
But soon after,
Lt. General Abraham Manalo caught me.

91
00:09:26,465 --> 00:09:31,003
I was court-martialed
and fired from the service.

92
00:09:32,772 --> 00:09:37,743
So, I went up to the mountains
until I became the leader of the group.

93
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:41,614
Is that why you took vengeance
on Lt. General Manalo?

94
00:09:41,681 --> 00:09:43,049
And you almost killed him?

95
00:09:43,115 --> 00:09:45,551
He deserves that.

96
00:09:50,623 --> 00:09:52,458
You are useless now.

97
00:09:53,793 --> 00:09:55,828
Maxine, he destroyed my life.

98
00:09:56,495 --> 00:10:00,399
Brother, do not blame the soldiers
for what happened to your life.

99
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:04,003
That was your decision.

100
00:10:05,204 --> 00:10:07,607
Maxine, you have no right to judge me.

101
00:10:07,673 --> 00:10:10,610
You don't know what I went through
in the hands of the soldiers.

102
00:10:10,676 --> 00:10:14,146
Rodel, not every soldier
has the same principle as you do.

103
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:22,154
Soldiers are not enemies. They are allies.

104
00:10:22,722 --> 00:10:25,491
Maxine, you don't know
what you're talking about.

105
00:10:25,558 --> 00:10:28,194
Brother, please. Please, brother.

106
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:31,564
-Just leave me alone.
-Brother, come on!

107
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:33,766
What? You're leaving again?

108
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:36,369
You're going to leave me again?
What? You will leave me again?

109
00:10:36,435 --> 00:10:40,139
-Do you want the soldiers to kill me?
-They're not going to kill you.

110
00:10:40,206 --> 00:10:41,807
You don't know what you're talking about!

111
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:59,191
Why are you defending those soldiers?

112
00:11:00,726 --> 00:11:02,161
Is it because of that Lucas?

113
00:11:03,129 --> 00:11:04,630
All right. Tell me.

114
00:11:04,697 --> 00:11:07,933
Who is more important to you?
That fool or I, your own brother?

115
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:11,570
Yes.

116
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:14,707
I saw the two of you yesterday.

117
00:11:14,774 --> 00:11:17,476
Tell me the truth.
Do you two have a relationship?

118
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:24,483
Maxine, remember this.

119
00:11:25,384 --> 00:11:29,188
As long as you and Lucas are together,
our family will never be complete.

120
00:11:29,255 --> 00:11:31,390
Don't you want everything
to go back to how they were?

121
00:11:32,725 --> 00:11:33,993
I'm sorry, Rodel.

122
00:11:36,095 --> 00:11:38,130
But I can't do what you want.

123
00:11:39,231 --> 00:11:40,700
I love Lucas.

124
00:11:47,807 --> 00:11:50,743
Did you know that my wife and child died
because of that man?

125
00:11:51,944 --> 00:11:55,648
I'll not stop until I kill those soldiers
who ruined my life.

126
00:11:57,249 --> 00:11:59,985
Brother, how long will you live in anger?

127
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:01,787
How long will you fight?

128
00:12:02,455 --> 00:12:06,025
How long will you endure
not being with me and Mom?

129
00:12:07,426 --> 00:12:11,430
The truth is, I want to be mad at you.

130
00:12:12,698 --> 00:12:14,533
I want to blame you.

131
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:20,673
Every night we always pray
for you to come back,

132
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,308
that you are safe.

133
00:12:23,275 --> 00:12:27,046
Brother, you should surrender.

134
00:12:28,347 --> 00:12:30,216
Please, surrender.

135
00:12:33,352 --> 00:12:35,821
It's not too late to start all over again.

136
00:12:41,727 --> 00:12:44,029
<i>Doc Beauty, do you copy? Where are you?</i>

137
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:47,233
You are wired? You set me up.

138
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,502
No.

139
00:12:51,303 --> 00:12:53,506
<i>Doc Beauty, do you copy?
Where are you?</i>

140
00:12:56,876 --> 00:12:58,244
Is that Lucas?

141
00:13:06,852 --> 00:13:09,155
Why are you letting that man fool you?

142
00:13:09,221 --> 00:13:13,859
Brother, Lucas is a good person.
If you could only get to know him better.

143
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:15,995
Maxine, remember this.

144
00:13:16,061 --> 00:13:19,064
As long as you and Lucas are together,
our family will never be complete.

145
00:13:20,866 --> 00:13:22,902
Don't you want everything
to go back to normal?

146
00:13:22,968 --> 00:13:23,803
I want to.

147
00:13:23,869 --> 00:13:25,838
Then just do as I tell you.

148
00:13:27,406 --> 00:13:28,707
Brother.

149
00:13:29,675 --> 00:13:30,776
Leave.

150
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:49,895
If you need help…

151
00:13:51,397 --> 00:13:52,665
just call me.

152
00:14:08,447 --> 00:14:10,015
Think about what I said.

153
00:15:04,503 --> 00:15:05,604
Where have you been?

154
00:15:07,673 --> 00:15:09,441
I've been looking for you.

155
00:15:15,681 --> 00:15:19,451
This is blood. Where did you get this?

156
00:15:22,321 --> 00:15:23,555
Where have you been?

157
00:15:25,991 --> 00:15:28,994
My wife and child died
because of that man!

158
00:15:30,496 --> 00:15:33,766
I'll not stop until I kill
those soldiers who ruined my life.

159
00:15:34,833 --> 00:15:39,138
I went to Sitio… Just the next Sitio.

160
00:15:39,204 --> 00:15:40,539
What?

161
00:15:42,574 --> 00:15:44,677
You left without a military escort.

162
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:50,149
Why did you do that?

163
00:15:51,817 --> 00:15:53,552
I'm sorry.

164
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:57,957
I wasn't able to think properly
because it was an emergency call.

165
00:15:58,023 --> 00:15:59,692
Someone was wounded.

166
00:15:59,758 --> 00:16:03,662
That's why I went there in a hurry.
I'm sorry.

167
00:16:03,729 --> 00:16:05,831
I know that you just want to help.

168
00:16:05,898 --> 00:16:07,599
But you know the protocol.

169
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:10,436
You can't leave the camp
without military escort.

170
00:16:10,502 --> 00:16:11,603
It's dangerous.

171
00:16:12,338 --> 00:16:15,474
What if you encounter a PRG member?

172
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:17,042
What if you get kidnapped?

173
00:16:17,109 --> 00:16:19,678
What if that happens again, Maxine?

174
00:16:22,047 --> 00:16:25,851
Lucas, I'm sorry.

175
00:16:25,918 --> 00:16:27,953
I just panicked.

176
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:29,955
It will not happen again. I'm sorry.

177
00:16:31,423 --> 00:16:32,524
Fine.

178
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:37,563
Just promise me.
I don't want this to happen again.

179
00:16:43,635 --> 00:16:44,803
What is it, Piccolo?

180
00:16:45,437 --> 00:16:49,608
Jess, the former PRG member
we captured, escaped.

181
00:17:13,098 --> 00:17:15,634
Wait, Bullet. It's me.

182
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:20,906
Boy helped me escape the military camp.

183
00:17:20,973 --> 00:17:22,474
We've been looking for you to help you.

184
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:25,811
Pistol is still after you.

185
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:29,148
Bullet, many of us still support you.

186
00:17:29,848 --> 00:17:31,583
We'll help you fight Pistol.

187
00:17:33,018 --> 00:17:35,587
Assemble our men. We will attack tomorrow.

188
00:17:36,121 --> 00:17:37,823
I just need to talk to someone.

189
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:39,491
Okay. Let's go.

190
00:17:55,441 --> 00:17:56,975
Sir, you called for me?

191
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:15,594
But I can no longer bear
seeing my daughter in this condition.

192
00:18:16,395 --> 00:18:17,729
She is suffering.

193
00:18:21,867 --> 00:18:25,938
Whatever I did, I'm really sorry.

194
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:31,610
But if you can't forgive me,
don't take it out on my daughter.

195
00:18:41,253 --> 00:18:44,857
Doc Ralph, have you seen Doc Moira?

196
00:18:44,923 --> 00:18:46,024
I didn't see her leave.

197
00:18:46,091 --> 00:18:47,993
I wonder where she went.

198
00:18:49,695 --> 00:18:51,563
Maybe Doc Maxine knows.

199
00:18:55,234 --> 00:18:58,370
Moira, what are you doing here?

200
00:18:59,872 --> 00:19:02,307
Sergeant Ramos, let's talk later.

201
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:04,176
You can go ahead.

202
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:07,880
Didn't you hear what Dad said?
You can leave.

203
00:19:23,962 --> 00:19:25,497
No, Moira.

204
00:19:26,899 --> 00:19:28,634
There's something you need to
know.

205
00:19:34,139 --> 00:19:36,608
What are you talking about?
What do I need to know?

206
00:19:44,216 --> 00:19:45,083
Rodel?

207
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:46,985
Maxine, can we meet?

208
00:19:47,886 --> 00:19:51,657
Brother, didn't I already tell you?
I can't do what you want.

209
00:19:51,723 --> 00:19:53,325
I love Lucas.

210
00:19:53,392 --> 00:19:55,661
Please, Maxine, let's just meet.

211
00:19:56,962 --> 00:19:58,897
Brother, it's just not possible.

212
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:03,635
Someone might see me.

213
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:05,704
My trip will be worthless.

214
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:08,273
Why? What do you mean?

215
00:20:09,908 --> 00:20:11,677
I'm here at your camp.

216
00:20:12,578 --> 00:20:13,712
What?

217
00:20:15,113 --> 00:20:16,782
I broke up with you…

218
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:21,486
because I found out something
about your father.

219
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:27,626
The reason why he used to be
against our relationship

220
00:20:29,361 --> 00:20:35,567
is because he's afraid we might find out
about his connection with my mother.

221
00:20:45,944 --> 00:20:47,646
Dad, what is Diego talking about?

222
00:20:51,183 --> 00:20:53,418
He and my mother had a relationship,

223
00:20:56,154 --> 00:20:58,090
when he was assigned in Davao.

224
00:21:00,192 --> 00:21:03,562
She was a widow who fell in love
with your father.

225
00:21:07,799 --> 00:21:09,968
But he left my mother…

226
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:14,106
for you and your mom.

227
00:21:18,243 --> 00:21:19,678
I was very young back then.

228
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:24,216
And yet I was full of anger

229
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:28,854
towards the man who caused
my mother's death.

230
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:31,923
The reason why I'm all by myself.

231
00:21:32,658 --> 00:21:35,394
And why my world crashed.

232
00:21:43,335 --> 00:21:47,906
Little did I know that he is your father.

233
00:22:15,133 --> 00:22:16,568
What are you doing here?

234
00:22:16,635 --> 00:22:18,970
Doc, who is he?

235
00:22:19,037 --> 00:22:21,239
Hazel, what are you doing here?

236
00:22:21,306 --> 00:22:22,708
Maxine, you brought someone else?

237
00:22:22,774 --> 00:22:24,343
-No, brother.
-Why?

238
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:27,379
-Rodel!
-Don't move.

239
00:22:27,446 --> 00:22:29,681
Brother, put that down.

240
00:22:29,748 --> 00:22:33,151
Please, don't hurt her. Put it down.
Put it down, please, brother.

241
00:22:33,218 --> 00:22:36,021
Doc, he's your brother?

242
00:22:39,991 --> 00:22:43,829
Hazel, it's a long story.
I'll tell you some other time.

243
00:22:43,895 --> 00:22:45,364
Brother, stop it, please.

244
00:22:49,534 --> 00:22:51,370
Hazel, please don't tell anyone.

245
00:22:52,170 --> 00:22:55,841
No one should know about this, okay?
Promise me.

246
00:23:00,011 --> 00:23:02,948
Brother, what are you even doing here?

247
00:23:03,014 --> 00:23:05,150
Maxine, you know what I want.

248
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:08,320
Rodel, I can't give you what you want.

249
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:09,921
I already told you, remember?

250
00:23:09,988 --> 00:23:12,124
Will you obey me or do you want
something bad to happen?

251
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:13,325
Rodel!

252
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:15,927
How long will you keep on doing this?
When are you going to stop?

253
00:23:15,994 --> 00:23:18,864
Not until I get my revenge on the people
who destroyed my life.

254
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:22,234
Brother, you need to stop.

255
00:23:23,568 --> 00:23:25,170
What are you going to do?

256
00:23:27,572 --> 00:23:29,608
Dad, answer my questions first.

257
00:23:30,275 --> 00:23:32,244
Is Diego telling the truth?

258
00:23:33,011 --> 00:23:34,212
My child, let me explain.

259
00:23:45,323 --> 00:23:46,858
Diego is telling the truth.

260
00:23:50,462 --> 00:23:54,299
Dad, you knew Diego
ever since he was young, right?

261
00:23:54,366 --> 00:23:55,667
Yes.

262
00:23:56,568 --> 00:23:57,969
Why do you ask?

263
00:23:58,036 --> 00:24:00,605
It's always a sore topic with us.

264
00:24:00,672 --> 00:24:04,576
He doesn't want to talk about his parents,
especially about his mother.

265
00:24:06,044 --> 00:24:08,880
Do you know his mother by any chance?

266
00:24:08,947 --> 00:24:12,250
Diego was an orphan when I met him.

267
00:24:12,317 --> 00:24:14,152
He was in the Boys Town.

268
00:24:14,219 --> 00:24:15,554
I took pity on him.

269
00:24:17,022 --> 00:24:19,090
I saw he had so much potential.

270
00:24:19,724 --> 00:24:22,627
He said he also wanted
to become a soldier.

271
00:24:29,734 --> 00:24:33,939
And you knew all this time
that he is the son of the woman you hurt?

272
00:24:40,045 --> 00:24:44,616
I'm sorry, Moira because I've hurt you.

273
00:24:45,984 --> 00:24:51,523
But every time I see you, I remember
all of the pain, and all of the anger.

274
00:25:20,919 --> 00:25:23,288
Tonight, we will attack the enemy

275
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:26,024
using the coordinates
provided by our intelligence.

276
00:25:26,091 --> 00:25:28,260
-Long live, Bullet!
-Long live!

277
00:25:28,326 --> 00:25:30,362
-Pistol is still our leader.
-What did you say?

278
00:25:30,428 --> 00:25:32,564
Pistol is the only one we'll obey.
No one else.

279
00:25:33,965 --> 00:25:36,268
Captain Manalo and the Alpha Team

280
00:25:36,334 --> 00:25:38,670
just returned from an operation
against the PRG.

281
00:25:38,737 --> 00:25:41,706
Technical Sergeant Ramos
got shot on the chest.

282
00:25:45,644 --> 00:25:47,746
I hope you can forgive me.

283
00:25:47,812 --> 00:25:51,750
I've been calling Doc Maxine,
but I can't contact her.

284
00:25:51,816 --> 00:25:53,552
I really couldn't lie.

285
00:25:53,618 --> 00:25:54,819
What is the problem?

286
00:25:54,886 --> 00:25:56,321
<i>PRG still has a lot of plans.</i>

287
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:59,691
We still have a lot to do.
You will understand if you join us.

288
00:25:59,758 --> 00:26:01,259
You know that I can't do that.

289
00:26:01,326 --> 00:26:03,628
-You cannot leave.
-What is the meaning of this?

290
00:26:03,695 --> 00:26:06,865
-Where did Maxine go?
-She went to the PRG camp.

291
00:26:06,932 --> 00:26:08,233
<i>Don't let her go.</i>

292
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:11,136
Brother, have you gone mad?
Are you out of your mind?

293
00:26:11,202 --> 00:26:14,172
I'm your sister! You can't do this to me.

294
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:15,974
I'm sorry, my sister.
