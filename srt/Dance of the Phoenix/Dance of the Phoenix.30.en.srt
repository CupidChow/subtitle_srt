2
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:40,420
(Episode 30)

3
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:42,760
How do I look?

4
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,040
Jun Linyuan!

5
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,920
Come back!

6
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,480
I hope today we'll forget everything

7
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:18,680
and have a happy and normal day.

8
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,960
Forget about cultivation, the enmity

9
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:23,240
and the struggle for power.

10
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,760
How could you leave me like this?

11
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,840
Don't you know

12
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,600
that I still want to spend many more

13
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,360
such happy days with you?

14
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,440
Wu.

15
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:03,600
Zhao Ge.

16
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,560
I think Jun Linyuan is still alive.

17
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,640
I can feel him.

18
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,160
Do you trust me?

19
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,920
Of course, I do.

20
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,720
But we need to perk up

21
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,880
before we can go rescue him.

22
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,440
You gotta cheer up.

23
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,600
Okay?

24
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:43,400
It's the legendary Master Mu!

25
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,840
Don't know what kinda crime he's committed.

26
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,080
How can they execute him for no reason?

27
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,320
It's so unfair!

28
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,480
Be careful with what you say.

29
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,200
The time is different now.

30
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,560
The cultivators of Junwu Academy
have all disappeared.

31
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,000
I'm afraid the world
is about to change hands.

32
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:58,840
Stop talking.

33
00:04:59,000 --> 00:04:59,840
It's not safe.

34
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,120
Let's go home! Come on!

35
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,120
Let's go! Hurry.

36
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,080
Come on!

37
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,280
Dear fellows!

38
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:21,320
Stop right there!
We know what you are going to say.

39
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:24,080
Holy Queen Gao will execute Master Mu.

40
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,720
He has only one day left.

41
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,080
You want us to help you

42
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,320
to get him out, right?

43
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,520
Dream on!

44
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,680
We are not their match at all!

45
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,520
We also want to save Master Mu,

46
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,520
but it's literally

47
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:37,680
a suicide mission!

48
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:49,800
Fellows,

49
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,320
could you please hear Feng Wu out?

50
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:56,600
Feng Wu, have you thought about us?

51
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:58,560
If we keep fighting like this,

52
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:00,240
what will happen to us?

53
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,560
Have you thought of that?

54
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,340
That's right.

55
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:04,740
Have you thought about us?

56
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,400
Master Mu sacrificed himself

57
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:07,600
for protecting us.

58
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,160
Besides, if Feng Wu hadn't

59
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,400
brought us all here,

60
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:12,200
we would have long been
taken by Holy Queen Gao!

61
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:13,720
She's right!

62
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,120
You've all seen what happened to her

63
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,640
and Goddess Zuo in the Illusion Mirror.

64
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,760
We don't want to be enslaved either!

65
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:22,560
However, even if we are going to fight back,

66
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,520
with your unknown identity,
how are you qualified to be our leader?

67
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,360
That's exactly my thought.

68
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,200
It makes sense!

69
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,480
Who gave her the right to...

70
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,280
Everybody, please be quiet.

71
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,640
What you said all makes sense.

72
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,880
But could you please let me say something?

73
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,360
Yes,

74
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,080
I don't belong here.

75
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,600
When I first got here,

76
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,840
I felt so depressed.

77
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:48,920
I couldn't help thinking why I should

78
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,880
carry the burden I shouldn't have carried,

79
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,160
and face the difficulties
I shouldn't have faced.

80
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,560
I admit

81
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:56,040
that my original purpose

82
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:58,680
was merely to awaken my Master Mu Jiuzhou

83
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,240
so that he could tell me the answer.

84
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,040
But then I met all of you,

85
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,960
and things have changed ever since.

86
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,880
Be it spirit energy, cultivation base,

87
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:08,480
the rise and fall of Qianyuan Continent,

88
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,400
or the duty to guard the people,

89
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:13,200
none of them was my concern before.

90
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:16,440
I was only interested in cooking,
collecting herbs,

91
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:18,600
and enjoying a carefree life.

92
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,920
But because I met you,

93
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,040
now I have friends,

94
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:22,800
family,

95
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,400
even my beloved.

96
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,840
I've fell in love with this place!

97
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,400
You want to know why I choose to stay here

98
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:31,200
and fight back?

99
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:35,120
Because I truly love this place.

100
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,440
And I'm sure

101
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:37,280
that

102
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,600
you love this place even more than I do!

103
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:43,120
In order not to lose more of our classmates,

104
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:46,280
friends and loved ones,

105
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,560
I hope

106
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:51,080
we can stick together.

107
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,520
It's not for me,

108
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,840
but for yourselves.

109
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:57,760
Let's guard and fight for our beautiful life,

110
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,360
our academy,

111
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,960
and our home we all cherish dearly.

112
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,480
Wu, I'll go with you!

113
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:06,400
Me, too!

114
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,480
I'm going with you!

115
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,440
-So are we!
-So are we!

116
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:11,680
-So are we!
-So are we!

117
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:16,040
We are going! So are we! So are we!

118
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,000
So am I!

119
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,280
Feng Xun! What are you doing here?

120
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,080
Xuan Yi sent me a secret letter.

121
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:31,000
I'm here to find you guys.

122
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,000
I can't let you guys go for a fight

123
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,440
without me!

124
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,120
Have you found any clue?

125
00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:39,480
It doesn't matter.

126
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,670
Holy Queen Gao must think that we are not

127
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,240
strong enough to attack head-on,

128
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,440
so we'll take her by surprise
and attack Junwu Divine Hall

129
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,160
before dawn while she's unprepared.

130
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,520
Fight to the death!

131
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:50,720
Eliminate demons and uphold justice!

132
00:08:51,040 --> 00:09:12,920
Fight to the death!
Eliminate demons and uphold justice!

133
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,000
What's the matter?

134
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:25,880
No worry.

135
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,520
I know you are concerned about Boss Jun.

136
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,840
But I trust Feng Wu's intuition.

137
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,000
I'm sure he's fine.

138
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:35,680
Xuan Yi.

139
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:40,600
Do you know

140
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,080
who I met this time

141
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,480
when I was at Penglai Pavilion?

142
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,560
The leader of Celestial Palace.

143
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,320
She was there to see Old Master.

144
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,000
After she left,

145
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:54,000
Old Master told me

146
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:57,360
that Zhao Ge's spirit energy is blocked

147
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:58,600
not because

148
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:00,720
she has limited talent.

149
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,280
What do you mean?

150
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,760
There's a valuable treasure

151
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,680
in Zhao Ge's body.

152
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,520
Red Sacred Bead,

153
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:10,960
which is the thing

154
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,120
that stops Zhao Ge's spirit energy
from increasing.

155
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,160
As a result, her cultivation base
has been weaker than the average.

156
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:16,960
Red Sacred Bead?

157
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:21,400
Red Sacred Bead is a precious treasure
left from the ancient times.

158
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:23,560
When it takes effect,
it can greatly increase the spirit energy.

159
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:24,520
However,

160
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,480
as soon as the bead separates from its host,

161
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:29,640
the host will perish right away.
There's no way to keep both.

162
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:34,800
Feng Xun,

163
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,200
promise me

164
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,600
you won't tell Zhao Ge about this.

165
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:40,720
That's why I'm here to tell you only.

166
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:42,920
The leader of Celestial Palace

167
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,760
sent her to the capital

168
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,280
so that no one else
could find out about this.

169
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:49,160
She's been trying to find a cure for Zhao Ge.

170
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:51,320
She's talked to Old Master many times

171
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,160
to find a way to separate
the bead from Zhao Ge's body,

172
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,640
but had no luck yet.

173
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:58,840
Xuan Yi,

174
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:00,760
with Zhao Ge's situation...

175
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,360
After we finished our mission,

176
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,120
I'll help Zhao Ge to find a solution.

177
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,000
No matter what,

178
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,800
I'll be with her

179
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,160
and keep her safe.

180
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:14,720
You are so bad!

181
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:17,160
Come here.

182
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:29,360
Where's the night patrol?

183
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,760
The people of Darknight Court

184
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,760
are so unreliable!

185
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:36,120
They can't even get the most basic job right!

186
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,000
Oh, no!

187
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:49,480
Where's the woman

188
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,760
we captured from the Feng family?

189
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:53,080
Bring her to me.

190
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:54,400
Yes.

191
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,400
Hey! Were you sleeping?

192
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,280
What's going on?

193
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:31,680
People all say that you are dead.

194
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,040
Do you know how sad Feng Wu is hearing that?

195
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:36,840
I found

196
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,400
Phoenix Blood.

197
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:41,040
But Lord Damon caught me.

198
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,520
Phoenix Blood? Where is it?

199
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,480
I've sealed it inside the wall
of the secret chamber.

200
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:49,840
Please go find it,

201
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,240
and give it to Feng Wu,

202
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:53,200
so that she can

203
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:55,600
stand a chance to fight against
Lord Damon and Holy Queen Gao.

204
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:56,680
I'll get you out of here first.

205
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:57,680
Don't mind me.

206
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,360
Go help Feng Wu.

207
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,360
If you are dead,

208
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:09,040
Feng Wu will be miserable
for the rest of her life.

209
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:13,560
Let me get you out first.

210
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:16,080
You can tell the rest to Feng Wu yourself.

211
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:17,880
Are you out of your mind?

212
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,120
Neither of us can get out in this case.

213
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,600
Cut the crap! Let's go!

214
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:22,800
Help! Someone broke into the jail!

215
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,120
-Oh, no!
-You should...

216
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,240
It's the Invisible Pill of Darknight Court.

217
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:30,400
You can hide inside the wall
or underground for two hours.

218
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:31,520
I promise you.

219
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:34,360
I will give Phoenix Blood to Feng Wu.

220
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:35,760
You...

221
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:37,920
Do not die.

222
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:40,560
Otherwise, no one will fight with me anymore.

223
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:20,640
My Lord.

224
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:24,520
Leave me the stuff,

225
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,600
and I'll spare your life.

226
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:52,120
It's here! Follow me!

227
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,160
Let's go!

228
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,240
Off you go.

229
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,800
What's with the noise outside?

230
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:16,680
Your Majesty,

231
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:18,040
Feng Wu and the remaining cultivators
of Junwu Academy

232
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:18,920
are attacking the Divine Hall right now!

233
00:17:19,110 --> 00:17:19,960
What?

234
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,200
She's actually bold enough

235
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:25,480
to attack me first!

236
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,040
Let's go.

237
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:20,200
Holy Queen Gao!

238
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:28,640
How dare you

239
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:31,680
attack Junwu Divine Hall?

240
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,800
You'll surely make
your Master Mu Jiuzhou proud.

241
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,280
Unfortunately,

242
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,040
today will be an end for you.

243
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,360
None of you can get out of here!

244
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:49,760
Feng Wu!

245
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:57,200
It's all because of you,

246
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,400
my Mingye

247
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:04,160
ends up like this!

248
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:05,440
Yu Mingye

249
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,720
could have had

250
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,120
a much happier life without you!

251
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,760
You don't deserve to be a father at all!

252
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,440
I'm the ruler of this continent!

253
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:37,560
Wanna kill me?

254
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,320
You are so ignorant!

255
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,480
Feng Wu!

256
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:05,360
No!

257
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:06,760
Phoenix Blood!

258
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:08,120
Stop her!

259
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:31,880
Go!

260
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:51,720
Master Mu! Master Mu!

261
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:53,680
Master Mu!

262
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:08,080
Master Mu!

263
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,080
Master Mu! Master Mu!

264
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:10,920
Wake up!

265
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,720
Come on! I'll take you out!

266
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:14,680
Don't!

267
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,200
Don't bother.

268
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:18,160
Just leave yourself.

269
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,240
Master Mu!

270
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,640
Let's attack Junwu Divine Hall!

271
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:23,120
Listen,

272
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:24,880
Feng Wu has brought people to save us.

273
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:25,680
Let's go!

274
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:26,800
Feng Wu...

275
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:28,560
How can she fight against

276
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:31,840
Lord Demon and Holy Queen Gao alone?

277
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,240
This is the only way

278
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:37,520
at this point!

279
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:38,840
Master Mu, what are you...

280
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:07,200
I can't hold it anymore!

281
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:10,080
We have to win more time for Feng Wu!

282
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:23,200
She's done so much for me.

283
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,600
It's time for me to do something for her.

284
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:30,320
Zhao Ge! What are you doing?

285
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:33,440
Red Sacred Bead.

286
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:36,280
How did you know?

287
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:38,680
Zhao Ge! Calm down!

288
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,400
We will figure out a way!

289
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:41,560
We even removed

290
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:42,920
Loveless Insect Venom from Boss Jun's body!

291
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:43,800
Zhao Ge!

292
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:57,640
Zhao Ge!

293
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,280
Yi.

294
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:06,640
I'm so lucky

295
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:09,440
to have met you!

296
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:11,400
Don't!

297
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:14,800
Wu!

298
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:16,760
You've got to win!

299
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:19,760
-Zhao Ge! What are you going to do?
-Zhao Ge!

300
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Zhao Ge!

301
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:34,920
Under heaven and the emperor star,

302
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,920
-tribulation strikes!
-Zhao Ge!

303
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,360
Red Sacred Bead!

304
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:39,680
Condense!

305
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:03,960
Yi!

306
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:05,120
Zhao Ge,

307
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,560
if this is your fate,

308
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:11,840
I'll go with you.

309
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:21,080
Zhao Ge!

310
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:22,720
Xuan Yi!

311
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,320
Xuan Yi!

312
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:48,400
Zhao Ge!

313
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:10,760
Feng Wu!

314
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:42,880
Feng Wu!

315
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:44,960
Put down your sword and stop resisting!

316
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:45,880
Mom!

317
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:47,640
Or else, I'll kill your mom!

318
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:50,160
Feng Wu! Don't mind me!

319
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:01,160
-Gao Wei!
-Mom!

320
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:03,000
Feng Wu, are you okay?

321
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:15,880
Are you alright?

322
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,760
Feng Xun, get my mom out of here!

323
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:18,640
Okay.

324
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:19,560
No, Feng Wu!

325
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:20,240
I can't leave you here alone!

326
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:21,400
Mom, don't worry about me.

327
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:22,160
Just go!

328
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:24,560
-No! I can't!
-Let's go, Madam. Come on.

329
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:25,520
Feng Wu!

330
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:39,240
Jun Linyuan!

331
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:43,680
Feng Wu!

332
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:49,400
Mu Jiuzhou

333
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:52,600
passed all his spirit energy

334
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:54,920
to you!

335
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:57,600
Jun Linyuan,

336
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:03,560
you win.

337
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:07,480
I guess it's destiny.

338
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:12,560
There's nothing I can do about it.

339
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:14,400
So why did you go through all the trouble?

340
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,840
If Mu Jiuzhou

341
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:23,400
didn't reject me back then

342
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:26,200
for his cultivation,

343
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:31,320
if I didn't

344
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:38,320
marry into this Junwu Divine Hall,

345
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:42,240
if...

346
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,680
There are no "ifs" in this world!

347
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:28,400
And now,

348
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:35,560
you have also left me.

349
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:41,240
For all these years,

350
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:46,800
I've never done anything for you.

351
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:27,920
This time,

352
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:32,600
I'll

353
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:36,920
go

354
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:41,280
with you.

355
00:34:18,150 --> 00:34:19,150
Father,

356
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:23,800
let me take you home.

357
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:08,640
Boss Jun,

358
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:10,520
why do I have to

359
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:13,000
end up being the only single one?

360
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:14,280
Compared with Xuan Yi,

361
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:15,760
I'm really not half bad.

362
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,160
Yet he has Zhao Ge,

363
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:19,280
and I have no one.

364
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:25,600
The flowers are so pretty!

365
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:27,240
Where did you get them?

366
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,440
I wasn't sure

367
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:30,720
what to get for Feng Wu's wedding.

368
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:32,040
Giving her flowers is not a bad idea.

369
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:35,040
But would they look too cheesy

370
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:36,200
to match my identity?

371
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:38,640
What do you think I should give her?

372
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:41,400
Boss Jun,

373
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:42,680
why did they leave?

374
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:44,040
Stop complaining!

375
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:45,520
If you talk less,

376
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:46,720
the ladies would appreciate and hang out

377
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:47,680
with you more.

378
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:49,160
What do you mean?

379
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:53,120
You are so much trouble!

380
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:54,720
Wouldn't riding your sword be better?

381
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:56,680
Why do you have to do it
in the conventional way?

382
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:58,040
And also, that Yu Mingye

383
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:59,880
said he'd come with us,

384
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:01,120
but there's still no sign of him.

385
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:02,280
I guess

386
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:04,400
he's already at the Feng family
and hanging out with Feng Wu.

387
00:36:11,980 --> 00:36:16,060
(Tongqi Pavilion)

388
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:27,880
Wu,

389
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:29,680
you are so beautiful today!

390
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:37,520
So will you one day!

391
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:40,000
Xuan Yi,

392
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:41,480
shouldn't you join the wedding procession?

393
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:42,680
What are you doing here?

394
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:44,600
Don't address me like that.

395
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,520
Boss Jun has Feng Xun to keep him company.

396
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:47,680
Plus,

397
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:50,680
I count myself as a member
of the Feng family now.

398
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:51,720
Alright.

399
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:53,880
We should thank Master Mu for securing

400
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:56,720
our nascent souls
with Dragon Phoenix Spirit Ring.

401
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:59,360
Wu and His Highness Jun

402
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:00,720
have also been helping us

403
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:02,400
find spiritual herbs.

404
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:05,400
Today is your wedding day.

405
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:07,320
We'll for sure
arrange everything well for you!

406
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:10,560
Got you!

407
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:12,320
And I'm wondering

408
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:14,880
when our wedding day will be.

409
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:17,680
Alright, you two.

410
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:19,800
Don't just stand there watching me.

411
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:21,080
You can wait outside.

412
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:22,160
Okay.

413
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:24,280
Then we'll go to the front gate

414
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:26,960
and welcome the procession.

415
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:28,640
Let's go.

416
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,240
Can't believe

417
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:46,520
my Feng Wu will get married soon!

418
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:50,040
Time really files.

419
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:51,520
Mom!

420
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:02,320
Mom!

421
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:11,560
I feel sad about your leaving.

422
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:15,040
I really do.

423
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:16,960
Mom!

424
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:20,280
Madam,

425
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:21,600
it's a happy day.

426
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,240
We should be happy for Young Lady.

427
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:31,800
That's right.

428
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:34,360
We should be happy.

429
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:38,440
I won't cry.

430
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:41,160
I won't cry anymore.

431
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:46,000
Mom.

432
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:54,840
Now,

433
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
let's put the bridal veil on for her.

434
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:06,160
Come here.

435
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:28,400
Mom.

436
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:32,440
Qiu Ling.

437
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:09,880
Master,

438
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:11,680
you scared me.

439
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:13,320
What are you doing here?

440
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:15,240
Would you like to take a rest
in the front hall?

441
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:17,200
The wedding procession will be here soon.

442
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:20,240
Feng Wu.

443
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:23,920
I'm here to pick you up.

444
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:37,640
This is the story of my second life.

445
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:40,240
Don't care too much about how it ends.

446
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:41,960
The most important thing

447
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:44,360
is that we've experienced,

448
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:45,960
grown up,

449
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:47,840
