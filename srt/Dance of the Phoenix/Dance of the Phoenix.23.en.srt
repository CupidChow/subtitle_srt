2
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:40,660
(Episode 23)

3
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,720
You were saying that Feng Wu replied you?

4
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,560
That's why

5
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,360
I was convinced that you were that person!

6
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:49,760
So it means

7
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,680
somebody disguised herself as me

8
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,680
and let me take the blame
for Dean Ning's death.

9
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,920
Huang Li, I gotta go
to take care of something.

10
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:07,280
Feng Wu has been acting mysteriously.

11
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,280
Stop pushing me!

12
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,880
Why did it take so long?

13
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,800
I thought you've got it!

14
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,160
Sorry! I'm sorry!

15
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,880
I was delayed by something urgent.

16
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:43,720
Where's the Star Shard?

17
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,480
That's more like it!

18
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,360
Master.

19
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,800
Please be patient.

20
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:01,720
You'll wake up soon.

21
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,120
This tree...

22
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:01,520
Lord Mu's nascent soul
has been awakened gradually,

23
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:04,880
so will the creatures in spirit ring.

24
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,080
I don't have to drag you in here anymore.

25
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,720
I can fly out and go find you.

26
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:23,640
Feng Wu, we are only
missing one last piece now.

27
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:53,520
Your Majesty.

28
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:59,400
Leave us.

29
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:17,000
How's your cultivation going?

30
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,520
With...

31
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:22,960
With Lord Demon's instructions,

32
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,000
I've broken through the first level.

33
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,040
Though you call him Lord Demon,

34
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,680
you are still reluctant
to learn from him, aren't you?

35
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,640
What's on your mind?

36
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,920
You can tell me.

37
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,400
I won't blame you.

38
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,880
In order to defeat Feng Wu,

39
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:42,320
I'd love to learn the Demonic
Cultivation Skills of Darknight Court.

40
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,400
After all, I'll get to decide
how to manage the power

41
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:47,000
after I master the skills.

42
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,360
But, I don't understand...

43
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,680
You don't understand

44
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:53,520
why I collaborate
with Darknight Court, right?

45
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:54,760
Your Majesty, please forgive me.

46
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,720
You are the Holy Queen of Junwu Clan.

47
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:59,200
The difference between
you and those evil demons

48
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,320
is like night and day!

49
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,360
But...

50
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,200
As one who was born
into a prestigious family,

51
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,400
you should know
that our country always comes first.

52
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,360
Let me ask you.

53
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,680
Between Crown Prince

54
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:14,240
and the people of our country,

55
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,120
which will you choose if you have to.

56
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,160
I will choose

57
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,680
the people of our country.

58
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,040
Exactly.

59
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,520
Actually, we have similar perspectives.

60
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:34,520
So, I've also made a choice.

61
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,680
Do you know

62
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,680
the history between Junwu Clan

63
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:43,320
and Darknight Court?

64
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,280
Years ago, the world was dominated

65
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:51,240
by demonic beasts
and the people lived in great misery.

66
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:55,880
At that time, a man stepped up

67
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,960
and led the four sects to fight against
those demonic beasts.

68
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,960
After a long-running battle,

69
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:05,800
they finally wiped out all demonic beasts.

70
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:13,200
You are talking about Mu Jiuzhou,

71
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,320
the founder of Junwu Academy?

72
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:15,760
Yes.

73
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,760
Throughout the history of Qianyuan Continent,

74
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:21,800
he's the only one who has ever
reached the rank of Spirit Immortal,

75
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:24,480
which is very close to Celestial Immortal.

76
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:26,080
But I heard

77
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,880
that he failed in his immortal cultivation

78
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,400
and ended up turning into ashes.

79
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:34,000
Mu Jiuzhou didn't fail.

80
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:37,400
He was interrupted at the most crucial time.

81
00:08:37,910 --> 00:08:38,880
Who did that?

82
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,120
The Holy Sovereign of Junwu.

83
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:49,440
I know that you can't accept this fact.

84
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:51,360
After all, no one would expect that

85
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:54,880
the Holy Sovereign of Junwu Clan,

86
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,960
the ruler of the whole Qianyuan Continent,

87
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,880
would do such a thing.

88
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,760
How could it be?

89
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:06,520
Back then,

90
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,880
Mu Jiuzhou picked two people

91
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:12,840
to be the candidates for replacing him
to govern the Qianyuan Continent.

92
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:15,400
One was the Holy Sovereign,

93
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:19,720
and the other
was Lord Demon of Darknight Court.

94
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:23,320
Mu Jiuzhou was such a wise person,

95
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:26,160
yet he was wrong about
picking a wrong person,

96
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:30,360
who fooled Mu Jiuzhou by playing nice

97
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,880
and became the ruler of Qianyuan Continent.

98
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,200
He pretended to be nice for 10 years,

99
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:38,720
but he sabotaged Mu Jiuzhou's cultivation when
he was just about to become Celestial Immortal.

100
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:40,520
How come what you said

101
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:43,520
is different from what I've been told
since I was little?

102
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:47,080
How... How could His Majesty...

103
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,120
Only the winner has a say
in defining good and evil.

104
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:53,000
Junwu Clan is not necessarily righteous,

105
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,960
and Darknight Court is not necessarily evil.

106
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,600
Then, His Highness Jun...

107
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:00,840
Jun Linyuan is his son.

108
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,680
But he'll know sooner or later

109
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:05,320
this cruel past.

110
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,800
And I believe that

111
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,400
he'll make the right choice

112
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,040
like you do.

113
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,560
This is why

114
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:14,400
I've been trying to bring you two together.

115
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,080
Qingluan,

116
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:22,640
Crown Prince has been bewitched by Feng Wu.

117
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:24,480
You are the only one

118
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,160
who can awake him!

119
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,880
I won't let you down, Your Majesty!

120
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,360
I will do my very best

121
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:34,880
to wipe out Feng Wu

122
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,480
and eliminate demons and uphold justice!

123
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,040
Thank you, Yi!

124
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:16,440
Did you sleep well?

125
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,320
Not bad.

126
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,440
Actually, Yi,

127
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:22,760
I've been feeling...

128
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:23,960
Tired, right?

129
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:30,560
Looks like

130
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,200
I pushed you too hard

131
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:34,880
to study internal
and external Cultivation Method,

132
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,120
to make you learn more about spirit energy.

133
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,120
I shouldn't have done that.

134
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,600
That's not true!

135
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,880
I know you did that for my benefit.

136
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,240
I just...

137
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:45,560
You just what?

138
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:50,040
I just want to balance myself better

139
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:52,120
and apply for a reward and punishment fairly.

140
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:54,680
So, sounds like

141
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,920
you are practicing cultivation for me?

142
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,200
It gives me more strength

143
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,840
when thinking of you!

144
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,200
As a lady,

145
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:06,880
you don't feel shy

146
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:08,720
saying such thing?

147
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,000
I don't care!

148
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,040
I tell you so that
you won't misunderstand me.

149
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,600
During the lantern festival last time,

150
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,880
I saw that you misunderstood me and Feng Xun.

151
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:17,840
There's nothing going on between us.

152
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:18,680
In my heart, I only have...

153
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:21,600
I know!

154
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:24,240
You want a fair reward and punishment.

155
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,080
You don't feel shy,

156
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:27,760
but I do.

157
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,800
Yi, you've got to keep your word.

158
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:27,520
Don't get me wrong.

159
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:28,680
I didn't mean any bad.

160
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,840
So, are you into me?

161
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,240
Are you here to date me?

162
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,360
You are such

163
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:35,960
a narcissist!

164
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:39,200
Are you also this flirtatious
when you talk to Feng Wu?

165
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:41,520
Is it that obvious?

166
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,160
Very!

167
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:45,040
I think everybody knows

168
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,920
that you are fond of Feng Wu.

169
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:47,840
So,

170
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,880
can you tell if Feng Wu is fond of me?

171
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,320
Forget it.

172
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:55,480
It's always hard to find out

173
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,160
what's on a girl's mind.

174
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:59,680
Plus, you are not that close to her.

175
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,400
I'd better trust my own instinct.

176
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:02,800
By the way,

177
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:05,480
this is the elixir made exclusively
by Celestial Palace.

178
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:07,720
It can enhance your cultivation base
and restore your spirit energy.

179
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:12,840
I used to

180
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:15,520
take elixirs of this level as candies.

181
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,160
Only the people from Celestial Palace

182
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:18,520
value them this much!

183
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:21,720
Our fellow disciples

184
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,680
of Celestial Palace once misunderstood you.

185
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:27,400
I also suspected you.

186
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:29,600
I apologize for those groundless

187
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:30,920
and mean accusations against you.

188
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,000
Don't! You are not wrong.

189
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,480
I am.

190
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:36,800
I don't even look like a good person.

191
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:38,120
And I never do good things.

192
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:39,640
Don't be so defensive.

193
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,520
It's Feng Wu who had me
realize that one shouldn't

194
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:44,200
infer a conclusion solely
based on one-sided evidence,

195
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:46,560
let alone rumors.

196
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:49,160
We can't judge people for no reason.

197
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:52,000
Besides, if it hadn't been for you,

198
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:53,480
Supervisor Wu's incident

199
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,120
would have caused a bigger trouble,

200
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,440
and we would have lost our chance

201
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:58,720
of studying in this academy.

202
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,720
So, I must apologize for misjudging you.

203
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:02,720
Hope you can forgive me!

204
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:18,880
Thank you

205
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:20,960
for your elixirs.

206
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:29,800
Just get to the point and say sorry.

207
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,160
The people of orthodox sects

208
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:34,440
always tend to make a speech.

209
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:36,200
It's so annoying!

210
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,400
Master, Senior Sister, greetings to you!

211
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:45,920
You too, Junior Sister.

212
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:47,560
Leader brought us here

213
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,560
to see how well you've trained
in Junwu Academy.

214
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:51,320
Thank you, Master, Senior Sister!

215
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:52,960
Where's Senior Sister Zuo?

216
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:53,680
I'm not sure

217
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:55,360
what she's been busy with lately.

218
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:56,600
I don't see her often either.

219
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:58,560
Now, let's go inside.

220
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,000
Master, please.

221
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:07,280
This is our Library Pavilion.

222
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,520
And our classroom Jingshi Hall
is not far from here.

223
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:12,560
Senior Sister!

224
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:19,760
Greetings to you, Master.

225
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:23,640
Qingluan,

226
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:26,360
have you been working hard on your spells?

227
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:27,880
Master,

228
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,200
I have never been slack.

229
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,680
Master, Senior Sister
is the most diligent one.

230
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:33,320
We all know it.

231
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:36,320
Why don't we let Senior Sister
give us a tour?

232
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,200
This way, Master.

233
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,120
Junwu Academy

234
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,200
is indeed the most
well-known cultivation place

235
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,120
in Qianyuan Continent.

236
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:55,600
Unfortunately, I'm not qualified
anymore for the selection.

237
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:57,440
Otherwise, I'd really love
to come here and meditate

238
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:58,960
to gain insights and spirit energy.

239
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:00,640
Junior Sister, you are being modest.

240
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:03,320
You are one of the best cultivators
in Celestial Palace,

241
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,960
and you are Master's right hand.

242
00:17:05,590 --> 00:17:06,590
The disciples here

243
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,240
are just amateurs.

244
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:11,560
Isn't that

245
00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:16,160
Zhao Ge?

246
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,830
So, she also studies in Junwu Academy.

247
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:21,920
When did she get detoxified?

248
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:23,680
Before she was recruited.

249
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,400
Junior Sister is quite lucky after all.

250
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,720
But she was still defeated by me.

251
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:50,680
Her moves seem to be self-created.

252
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:52,640
She is quite impressive!

253
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,160
I haven't seen her for years.

254
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:55,720
Her spirit energy has increased a lot.

255
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:59,280
Come on, let's go check out.

256
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:04,160
Junior Sister.

257
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:07,680
Senior Sister.

258
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:18,880
Master is here to see us.

259
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:22,960
Leader!

260
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:27,400
Junior Sister,
I just saw that you were training.

261
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:29,040
You are quite good at playing slingshot.

262
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:31,640
I didn't know you
were also recruited by Junwu Academy.

263
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:34,200
Our sisters in Celestial Palace

264
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:35,800
will be happy for you if they know.

265
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,920
I'd like to compete with Zhao Ge

266
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,600
in front of Master.

267
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:45,840
Mu Yao,

268
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,520
watch your behavior,

269
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,440
and don't give Junior Sister a hard time.

270
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:53,520
Senior Sister, don't worry.

271
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:55,960
It'll just be a friendly contest between us.

272
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,520
Rarely does Master visit here.

273
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:59,400
I'm sure she also wants
to see how good Zhao Ge is.

274
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:00,680
Don't you, Master?

275
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:04,800
Alright.

276
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:16,960
Please.

277
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,040
Junior Sister,

278
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:21,600
you might get hurt. Watch out!

279
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,840
Zhao Ge, let's begin!

280
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:29,680
Please.

281
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:57,840
Your slingshot works better from a distance.

282
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,240
If the enemy gets too close,

283
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:00,280
what will you do?

284
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,760
As Master's daughter,
she indeed lives up to her identity.

285
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,240
She has well mastered
the Ice Cultivation Methods.

286
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,920
Looks like her cultivation was slow-paced

287
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:33,840
because she didn't get the knack of it.

288
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:36,640
It's a good idea.

289
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,880
But an icicle fence

290
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,920
will also get herself stuck.

291
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,240
Enough! The result has come out!

292
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:09,400
I didn't expect that Junior Sister
has improved this much!

293
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,040
Master must be very proud of you!

294
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,040
I still have a long way to go.

295
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:16,880
But I want to thank Wu for detoxifying me

296
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:18,720
and teaching me how
to locate acupoints with slingshot.

297
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:19,920
I also want to thank Yi.

298
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:24,840
You are just Master's abandoned daughter!

299
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,200
What are you bragging about?

300
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:28,720
Mu Yao, watch your mouth!

301
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,520
Did I say anything wrong?

302
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,720
She's been bad at cultivation
since she was little.

303
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,360
That's why Master abandoned her!

304
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:35,240
Shut up!

305
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:38,720
As a disciple of Celestial Palace,
how can you be so rude?

306
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,360
If you don't change your ways,

307
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:42,120
I'll kick you out of Celestial Palace!

308
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:49,520
Mu Yao!

309
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:52,200
Master, please forgive us!

310
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:53,680
Mu Yao is too ignorant.

311
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:55,160
I'll go talk to her.

312
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:14,680
Mu Yao!

313
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:23,560
Senior Sister.

314
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,160
I know you're going
to lecture me again for her.

315
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,920
But I just don't like her!

316
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,120
She's been such a loser since she was little.

317
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:33,200
And now, she's just got a little better

318
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,280
in training by pure luck,

319
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,040
yet everybody praised her like crazy.

320
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,160
How could things be like this!

321
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:41,280
I don't care about what others say,

322
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,280
but you, Senior Sister,

323
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:45,520
you also take her side.

324
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:47,000
However, she's still

325
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:48,840
being ungrateful,

326
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:50,480
and thinks Feng Wu is better than you.

327
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:53,160
I know you think it's unfair.

328
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:54,760
And I understand

329
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,560
that you've been working hard

330
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:58,880
because you don't want
to be looked down upon.

331
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:00,520
What's the big deal about Zhao Ge?

332
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:02,880
She has nothing but her identity.

333
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:05,120
If she weren't Master's daughter,

334
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:06,880
she would be dead long time ago!

335
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,120
Senior Sister,

336
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:12,680
I really feel wronged for you!

337
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:13,720
Mu Yao.

338
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,400
She's Master's daughter.

339
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:16,880
She should have been the Goddess

340
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:18,320
of Celestial Palace.

341
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:20,400
She came to the capital

342
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:22,080
only because of her limited capability.

343
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:24,520
But now, her cultivation base has increased.

344
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:25,960
If our master changes her mind

345
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:28,600
and takes Zhao Ge back one day,

346
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,800
you'll have to hand over the Goddess position

347
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:31,920
to her!

348
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:35,320
Mu Yao.

349
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:36,800
Tell me the truth.

350
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:38,920
Do I treat you well?

351
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:43,200
You treat me as your real sister.

352
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:45,320
You are the one who treats me

353
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:46,920
the best in this world.

354
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,440
But do you know

355
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,720
she was also the one

356
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:56,120
who treated me the best?

357
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,320
Since you see me as your Senior Sister,

358
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:00,480
then you've got to listen to me.

359
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:04,400
People say "It's better to make friends
than make enemies."

360
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:06,960
Our real enemy is definitely  not Zhao Ge.

361
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:08,120
At this point,

362
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:10,160
we can't afford to have more enemies.

363
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,840
Instead, we should

364
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,560
make more friends.

365
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:19,000
After all, Zhao Ge
is one of our sect fellows.

366
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,760
If we can make her return to Celestial Palace

367
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:22,280
and become one of us,

368
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:24,760
even if she's not on our side,

369
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:26,520
as long as she won't

370
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:29,000
go against us for Feng Wu,

371
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:30,440
things will be better.

372
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:32,560
But, if she comes back,

373
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:34,520
your position will...

374
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:39,400
As long as we can defeat Feng Wu,

375
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,800
I'm okay to give up the Goddess position.

376
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,160
Senior Sister.

377
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:46,000
Are you sure about this?

378
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:48,680
It wasn't easy for you to become the Goddess.

379
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,040
I've made up my mind!

380
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:55,440
No matter what,

381
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:57,600
don't make it difficult for Zhao Ge again.

382
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:59,640
Be nice to her

383
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,560
and get along with her. Okay?

384
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:05,360
Alright.

385
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:07,800
Let's go see Master and Junior Sister off.

386
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25,000
Zhao Ge.

387
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:28,880
Yi!

388
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:37,680
What's wrong?

389
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,440
You are not happy about winning the contest?

390
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:41,360
My mom...

391
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,840
I mean the leader

392
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:46,880
left without saying

393
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:48,880
anything.

394
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:54,720
I think

395
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:57,120
she just couldn't swallow her pride

396
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:59,160
and admit that you've improved a lot

397
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:01,120
to your face.

398
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:03,240
Really?

399
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:08,200
Then I should thank you for teaching me well!

400
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,360
Don't mention it!

401
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:22,520
If nothing else,

402
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:24,080
I'll leave now.

403
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:25,360
Yi.

404
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:33,160
See you...

405
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:34,920
See you tomorrow in class!

406
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:43,920
I'm so stupid!

407
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:45,760
It was such a good opportunity,

408
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:47,760
yet I blew it!

409
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:51,760
See you tomorrow!

410
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:54,080
See you!

411
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:24,720
It's a nice painting.

412
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:27,120
But the workmanship

413
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:28,760
really sucks!

414
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,320
I guess whoever made it

415
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,320
must be from a wealthy family

416
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,800
and have a poor hands-on ability.

417
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:50,040
What are you doing? You scared me!

418
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:52,160
You are a girl in love!

419
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:53,720
I couldn't bear to watch anymore.

420
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:55,600
Who's in love?

421
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:56,920
Stop talking nonsense!

422
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:59,840
I was just trying to find a nice place

423
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:02,520
in my room for this lantern.

424
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,720
I don't think it'll make your room look nice.

425
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:06,400
It's such an ugly lantern.

426
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:07,440
How so?

427
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:10,120
You silly bird! What do you know?

428
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:10,840
That's not true!

429
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:12,640
You said it was ugly first!

430
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:13,440
I didn't!

431
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:14,640
You did!

432
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:15,040
I didn't!

433
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:15,600
You did!

434
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:16,400
You silly bird!

435
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:17,200
Silly!

436
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:17,760
Silly!

437
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:18,880
You are silly!

438
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,240
Silly bird! Silly bird! Silly bird!

439
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:25,280
Alright! I won't forget my business.

440
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:28,000
You are a nagging silly bird!

441
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:35,320
Wu, what's the matter?

442
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,240
So, what Senior Sister said...

443
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:44,680
What's wrong?

444
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:45,880
Are you okay?

445
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,600
I... I'm fine.

446
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,560
I hurt myself by accident.

447
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,960
Look at you! You've got to be more careful!

448
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:53,680
Let me see.

449
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:55,960
Are you alright?

450
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:59,760
Wu. I'm sorry.

451
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:01,200
Sorry?

452
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:03,680
I mean

453
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:06,560
I'm sorry for being so careless

454
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:07,840
and making you worried.

455
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,560
It's okay.

456
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:17,360
By the way,
will you go to the fireworks show tonight?

457
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:18,680
Fireworks show?

458
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:19,560
Yes.

459
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:22,240
His Majesty had such a big accident
on the night of Chinese Valentine's Day.

460
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:24,120
The fireworks show
that was supposed to take place

461
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,920
after the lantern show had to be canceled.

462
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:28,400
But people are still looking forward to it,

463
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:30,080
so they decided to hold it today.

464
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:32,080
In that case,

465
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,480
I'd love to go watch it.

466
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,120
Let's go together!

467
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:42,160
You have a date with Yi, don't you?

468
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:46,320
I forgot that!

469
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:47,800
I don't.

470
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:49,120
Let's go watch it together.

471
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:50,640
I've made an arrangement.

472
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:52,640
Arrangement? What arrangement?

473
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:55,160
The route!

474
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:56,760
I assure you that you'll have a good time!

475
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:10,560
-Look at mine!
-Look!

476
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:16,520
-Look!
-It's so beautiful!

477
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:17,960
There are so many people!

478
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:18,920
Yes!

479
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:25,040
Look!

480
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,240
So pretty!

481
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:31,840
Feng Wu!

482
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:36,400
What are you doing here?

483
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:37,800
Let me take you to a nice place!

484
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:39,400
But, Zhao Ge...

485
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:42,120
Zhao Ge, wait for me!

486
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,520
I'll be right back!

487
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:45,800
Yu Mingye!

488
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:47,960
What is he doing here?

489
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:57,000
Why do you take me here?

490
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:58,280
It's high enough.

491
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:01,280
Let's watch the fireworks up here later.

492
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:02,440
It must be magnificent!

493
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:00,560
Look over there!

494
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:04,200
I didn't know
that they were in a relationship.

495
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:06,720
They do look good together!

496
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:14,040
What are they doing here?

497
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:16,520
Not too bad.

498
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:19,240
It's not that far
from His Highness Jun's place.

499
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:30,360
Why is His Highness Jun not here yet?

500
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:02,440
Our classmates have seen us!

501
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:04,400
They'll gossip about us anyway.

502
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:06,480
Why don't we just start dating,

503
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:07,760
so that we don't need to explain anything?

504
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:09,320
There's nothing to explain.

505
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:10,800
I've never cared about

506
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:12,040
what others would say.

507
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:16,800
What do you think?

508
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:18,800
Doesn't the night view look lovelier

509
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,600
while you are with me?

510
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:23,760
It's not bad.

511
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:37,720
Is there something on my face?

512
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:38,680
No.

513
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:41,880
I just think you look quite pretty today.

514
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:44,160
Why did you say that all of a sudden?

515
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:46,160
Can't you just learn something good

516
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:47,680
instead of how to hit on girls?

517
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:49,680
I thought you'd buy that!

518
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:51,280
You know,

519
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:53,560
I grew up in Darknight Court.

520
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:56,120
I used to believe that

521
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:59,000
life was all about getting stronger

522
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:02,040
and eliminating all the barriers

523
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,720
at all cost,

524
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:10,040
until I met you.

525
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:22,190
This is the only thing my mom left me.

526
00:34:23,190 --> 00:34:24,190
I want you to have it.

527
00:34:24,670 --> 00:34:25,630
I can't take it.

528
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:26,710
It's too valuable.

529
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:30,600
I mean

530
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,800
you'll meet the right one

531
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,760
who's willing to accept your love.

532
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:42,920
Actually, I know

533
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:45,630
that you only have Jun Linyuan in your heart.

534
00:34:51,190 --> 00:34:52,000
It's okay.

535
00:34:52,230 --> 00:34:53,670
Guess I lost again.

536
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:56,760
Don't look at me with guilt.

537
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:58,880
It's just my habit

538
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,280
to take away Jun Linyuan's stuff.

539
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:03,520
We can always be friends, right?

540
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:05,200
I don't think that petty guy Jun Linyuan

541
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:06,920
will not allow you to hang out with me.

542
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:09,240
I don't think so either.

543
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:12,160
Though he never said anything,

544
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:13,640
Jun Linyuan has been

545
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:15,720
seeing you as his worthy opponent.

546
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:17,360
Of course!

547
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:19,080
In Qianyuan Continent,

548
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,120
I'm the only one

549
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:22,200
who's qualified to compete against him.

550
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:30,200
He should be looking for you tonight.

551
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:32,200
Go to him.

552
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:33,640
If he can't find you,

553
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:36,000
his jealousy

554
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:38,320
will turn the entire capital upside down.

555
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:41,360
Yu Mingye, actually...

556
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:42,920
It's okay. Stop talking.

557
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:44,640
If you keep going,

558
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:46,400
I'll change my mind.

559
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:55,040
Let's have a drink some other day.

560
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:14,960
In this world,

561
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:17,000
although I'm surrounded by dangers,

562
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:19,200
it's still a meaningful life.

563
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:20,920
What should I do?

564
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,440
I really don't want to leave here.

565
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:29,600
So, are you in love?

566
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:30,800
I'm not!

567
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:36,400
What are you doing?

568
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:38,000
I want to see your eyes,

569

so that I'll know if you are lying.

570

I'm Young Master Feng, for God's sake!

612
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:28,840
I've been training
and improving my spirit energy,

613
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:30,080
and all my hard work is

614
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:31,000
to help Jun Linyuan surprise girls

615
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:32,040
and blow up the lanterns?

616

You should also try harder!

620
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:48,760
I made too many lanterns.

621
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:51,640

624
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:07,120
What are you going to tell me?

625
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:10,320
If you are going to complain about Wu again,

626
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:11,600
I'll leave.

627
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:12,680
Zhao Ge,

628
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:16,040
you are with Feng Wu every day,

629
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:18,000
you must have noticed that she's different.

630
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:19,360
I...

631
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:21,840
Think carefully.

632
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,440
Isn't the current Feng Wu

633
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:26,920
is night and day from the previous Feng Wu?

634
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:28,920
That's to say,

635
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:31,800
Feng Wu is indeed livelier and brighter now.

636
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:34,960
Previously, after her father passed away,

637
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:37,200
she always kept things to herself.

638
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:39,440
But all the people will grow up.

639
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:40,920
That doesn't show anything.

640
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:43,760
But don't you think since
she came to the capital,

641
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:47,080
it seems nothing has happened by chance

642
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:50,160
but done on purpose
after being carefully planned?

643
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:53,000
If the current Feng Wu

644
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:54,480
is really someone else,

645
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:57,280
won't all these coincidences make sense?

646
00:40:58,040 --> 00:40:58,960
I guess

647
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:00,440
someone must be

648
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:02,720

649
