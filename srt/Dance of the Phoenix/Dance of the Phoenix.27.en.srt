=Dance of the Phoenix=

2
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:40,780
(Episode 27)

3
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,600
You had such a great opportunity
at the Sky-reaching Terrance.

4
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,560
Even though Feng Wu
achieved the Spiritual Elder's rank,

5
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,200
she was too weak to exert all her power.

6
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,120
You were strong enough

7
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,720
to put her down.

8
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,360
Why did you let her go?

9
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,640
Even the heavenly lightning
failed to kill them.

10
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,320
It shows the time wasn't right.

11
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,800
If we went against fate,

12
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:04,640
we might pay unnecessary prices.

13
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:05,640
Besides,

14
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,910
Yu Mingye risked his life
to protect that girl.

15
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,120
I'll make sure she dies

16
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,280
for the greater cause.

17
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:15,600
But she shouldn't die now.

18
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:16,320
Fool.

19
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,640
If Feng Wu is right

20
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,800
that three Star Shards

21
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,320
can wake up Mu Jiuzhou,

22
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,520
then all the hard work
we've done over the years

23
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,560
will be for nothing.

24
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,400
Do you understand?

25
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,440
Please don't be angry, aunt.

26
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,800
The Dragon Phoenix Spirit Ring
is still in our hands.

27
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:32,440
Though Feng Wu possesses all the Star Shards,

28
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,640
she won't be able to wake up Mu Jiuzhou.

29
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,760
And even if he wakes up,

30
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,640
he won't have the strong spirit energy

31
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,240
he had in his prime,

32
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,360
now that he's failed

33
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,640
to pass the Heavenly Tribulation
and slept for years.

34
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,320
I'll fight him.

35
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,520
I'm confident that I will defeat him.

36
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,440
You're risking everything I have

37
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,920
to satisfy your desire to win.

38
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:52,720
No.

39
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,400
Mu Jiuzhou must not come back to life.

40
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,040
Zuo Qingluan.

41
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,000
Yes.

42
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,160
Bring Feng Wu's family here.

43
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,320
Force her to give up.

44
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,320
But

45
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,240
we are a righteous sect.

46
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,800
It's a pity that we lost to them
in a head-to-head battle,

47
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,720
but it's not shameful.

48
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,440
Now you're asking me to hurt innocent people,

49
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:10,880
I...

50
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,760
Can you please sober up?

51
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,400
You're practicing Demonic Cultivation Skills.

52
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,840
You have killed your Junior Sister.

53
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:18,280
You think you are the same person
you once were?

54
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,480
I can't believe you're still clinging

55
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,220
to the righteous sect's hypocrisy.

56
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,080
Ridiculous.

57
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,320
Your Majesty, you...

58
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,040
Only the winners

59
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,360
can ignore other people's opinions.

60
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:29,720
Do you understand?

61
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:35,520
Yes.

62
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:38,720
Wait.

63
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,000
I'll keep this

64
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,120
for you.

65
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:54,040
If they take it away,

66
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,520
it will help them.

67
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:56,600
Go.

68
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,400
Yes.

69
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,920
It seems the plan

70
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,960
must be implemented ahead of schedule.

71
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:16,240
Gao Wei.

72
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:20,830
You know what to do.

73
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,000
Yes.

74
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,040
Go.

75
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:24,560
Yes.

76
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:40,880
I only have

77
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:44,280
one question for you.

78
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,160
Now...

79
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,040
Say no more.

80
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,400
Over twenty years ago,

81
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:51,320
I swore to protect you.

82
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,000
I still haven't

83
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,000
changed my mind.

84
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,040
Alright.

85
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,400
I need you

86
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,960
to gather the whole Darknight Court

87
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,720
in the capital and wait for my orders.

88
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,920
Darknight Court has suffered losses.

89
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,200
If we stake everything on this,

90
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:12,680
I'm afraid...

91
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,320
Zuo Qingluan is just my pawn.

92
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:19,160
If we can't stop Mu Jiuzhou from waking up,

93
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,040
I'll need you to go all out.

94
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:24,040
You must eliminate Mu Jiuzhou and Feng Zhou

95
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,680
even if it means going against
the other three sects.

96
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:29,880
What?

97
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,320
You are unwilling?

98
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:37,560
You just said

99
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:40,840
you'd protect me.

100
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:43,400
Now I'm asking you
to stake everything on this

101
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,680
and join me in the fight,

102
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:46,080
but you're unwilling.

103
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,240
It seems

104
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,760
you don't do as you say.

105
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:57,880
Ziyan,

106
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:03,520
I can stake the whole
Darknight Court on this.

107
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,520
Even if our plan failed

108
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,760
I'd be willing to die with you.

109
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:10,040
Fail?

110
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,480
Why would it fail?

111
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:16,080
The whole Qianyuan Continent

112
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:19,240
will be mine.

113
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:23,880
Okay.

114
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,280
Give me my Dragon Phoenix Spirit Ring.

115
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,920
You colluded with the demon.

116
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:01,440
How dare you enter Junwu Academy?

117
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,040
You think the cultivators here

118
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,400
won't attack you?

119
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,080
Zuo Qingluan,

120
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,160
you said there was an old fairy
on Baiding Mountain

121
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,800
who could prove Feng Wu's identity.

122
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:11,840
You made that up to lure me there.

123
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,000
Feng Wu met Miss Wolf

124
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,360
on the mountain because of me.

125
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,240
How can you bend the truth

126
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,960
and accuse Feng Wu
of colluding with the demon?

127
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,400
Junior Sister,

128
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,440
the leader of Celestial Palace
has ordered you

129
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,800
to stop meddling in this.

130
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,240
Besides,

131
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:29,360
don't you have the slightest doubt?

132
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,000
I...

133
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,200
Stop alienating us from another.

134
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,080
You said all that

135
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,160
to stop me from waking up my Master

136
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,320
and exposing your lies.

137
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,800
Give me my Dragon Phoenix Spirit Ring

138
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,200
and we can talk things out.

139
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,800
You claim Mu Jiuzhou is your Master.

140
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,040
Ridiculous.

141
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:57,440
When Mu Jiuzhou disintegrated,

142
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,240
you weren't even born.

143
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:03,120
Besides, you are not even Feng Wu.

144
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,320
The real Feng Wu was...

145
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:10,960
Was killed by you, right?

146
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:14,040
Zuo Qingluan, you have finally admitted it.

147
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,320
You launched a sneak attack

148
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,240
to steal Phoenix Blood.

149
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,080
Look how despicable your actions are.

150
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:21,800
You have no right to talk about
eliminating demons and upholding justice.

151
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,840
You're just making excuses
to defend yourself.

152
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,200
Fine.

153
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,400
You've refused to admit the fact.

154
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:32,440
But I'd like to see you deny it

155
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:34,520
in front of your closest ones.

156
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:48,640
Mom. Qiu Ling.

157
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:56,000
Zuo Qingluan, you shameless bastard.

158
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,240
I'm a shameless bastard?

159
00:08:59,120 --> 00:08:59,960
You pretend to be Feng Wu

160
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,880
and live her life.

161
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,840
Aren't you a shameless bastard?

162
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:18,960
Forgive me, Madam.

163
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,760
It concerns Junwu Clan's future

164
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,800
and your daughter's life.

165
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,520
I had no choice

166
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:29,080
but to invite you here in this way.

167
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:33,600
Madam,

168
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:36,080
you lived with Feng Wu.

169
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:38,000
I'm sure you can notice

170
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,800
what's wrong with her.

171
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:41,800
Feng Wu,

172
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,800
will you make more excuses to defend yourself

173
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:46,640
in front of your mother who nurtured you

174
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,400
and your maid who kept you company every day?

175
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,440
I don't understand, Goddess Zuo.

176
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,800
You said Feng Wu is not Feng Wu.

177
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,560
Then who is she?

178
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:14,480
What about you?

179
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,400
Have you been deceived
by the fake Feng Wu too?

180
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,720
I only serve one lady

181
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,200
and that's her.

182
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:30,160
Threaten us all you want,

183
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:31,720
I won't betray my Young Lady.

184
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,600
But she lied!

185
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,160
Senior Sister, don't let this
ruin your manners.

186
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:35,920
Don't touch me.

187
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:13,680
Why?

188
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:15,880
Why do you all

189
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,560
believe the fake Feng Wu?

190
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:20,840
A just cause enjoys abundant support,
while an unjust one finds little support.

191
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:22,080
Zuo Qingluan,

192
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,840
do you still not understand?

193
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Cut the crap.

194
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,240
It's time

195
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,800
to end

196
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,000
our feud.

197
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,440
My Dragon Phoenix Spirit Ring.

198
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,000
Do you want it?

199
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,080
Go in there and get it.

200
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,080
Master!

201
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:04,960
-Feng Wu!
-My Lady!

202
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:12,920
Feng Wu,

203
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:16,560
you'll lose in the end.

204
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:22,160
Feng Wu!

205
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,280
Zuo Qingluan,

206
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,040
what did you do?

207
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:34,520
Your Highness Jun,

208
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,320
your Feng Wu

209
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:38,560
will never come back.

210
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,560
It's useless.

211
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,200
Nobody can break

212
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,600
the energy barrier of Illusion Mirror.

213
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,880
It's Celestial Palace's
treasure Illusion Mirror.

214
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,840
I have heard of this thing.

215
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:59,080
It's said

216
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,360
this is the ultimate treasure
created by Master Mu.

217
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:03,600
Once a person enters
the void of Illusion Mirror,

218
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,840
she'll face her inner demons.

219
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:08,000
If she can't overcome her inner demons,

220
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,560
she'll be trapped inside

221
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:10,920
and disintegrate.

222
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:14,760
Zuo Qingluan, you are so cruel.

223
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:17,440
I'll return to beg
Celestial Palace's leader.

224
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,840
Perhaps there's a way out.

225
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,040
Junior Sister,

226
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:24,000
don't waste your strength.

227
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,600
Boss Jun, what are you doing?

228
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I'm going in there to save her.

229
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,320
Jun Linyuan,

230
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:37,640
you know

231
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:38,880
she is not the Feng Wu

232
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,720
who has been engaged to you since childhood.

233
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,600
Why are you fighting for her?

234
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:44,800
Do you know

235
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:47,080
the consequences

236
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:47,960
of breaking into Illusion Mirror?

237
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,400
I don't care about the consequences.

238
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,440
I won't give up her.

239
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,120
Why?

240
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:55,880
You are doing so much

241
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,640
for a person of unknown origin.

242
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:58,600
I'd like to ask you why.

243
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,520
You used to care about the people.

244
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,240
What made you turn into
the person you are today?

245
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:06,640
Wake up.

246
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:10,000
Will you hurt so many people

247
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:12,560
for your selfish desires?

248
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,840
I won't let you treat Wu this way.

249
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:20,960
Junior Sister.

250
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,920
Even you go against me.

251
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,040
Now I don't

252
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,320
care about anything.

253
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,920
No one must have

254
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,120
the things I don't have.

255
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,160
I'm destroying her right now.

256
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:39,760
I'd like to see

257
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,080
whoever can save her.

258
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:44,800
No!

259
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:49,960
-Boss Jun!
-Your Highness Jun!

260
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,680
-Senior Sister Zuo!
-Senior Sister Zuo!

261
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:00,400
Illusion Mirror

262
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,480
contains numerous spaces.

263
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:06,360
Every space is a combination
of truths and illusions.

264
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:10,240
The person in a space
will be deceived by the illusions.

265
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:13,280
She'll think she's back in time
or time has been reset

266
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:15,480
and she can be around the people she has lost

267
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:17,640
and have the things she can't have.

268
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,600
Then her inner demons will plague her

269
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,200
and her desires will bewitch her.

270
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:22,520
Can you hear me?

271
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:23,520
Colored Phoenix.

272
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:14,280
Feng Wu.

273
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,080
Feng Wu.

274
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,120
Feng Wu.

275
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:25,240
Feng Wu.

276
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:28,160
Feng Wu!

277
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:47,400
Mom.

278
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,080
Linyuan.

279
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:01,080
Linyuan.

280
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,080
You've toiled

281
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:04,920
over the years.

282
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,070
Mom.

283
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:15,240
I'm sorry

284
00:17:15,590 --> 00:17:16,920
that my birth caused you...

285
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:18,640
Silly kid.

286
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,240
Don't say that.

287
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,400
I'm back now.

288
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:24,880
We can live happily

289
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:27,520
as a family.

290
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,040
What's wrong, Linyuan?

291
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:38,480
No.

292
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,280
You are not my mom.

293
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,640
My mom died giving birth to me.

294
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,840
But I'm back.

295
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:57,480
You are not back.

296
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:00,160
You can't be back.

297
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:04,760
It's a fact.

298
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,560
My Linyuan has grown up.

299
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,600
You no longer need me.

300
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:12,280
No.

301
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:13,600
You have always been with me

302
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:17,600
here

303
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,160
and here.

304
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:34,840
But you shouldn't be here.

305
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:37,480
Linyuan,

306
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:40,440
do what you should do.

307
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:42,320
Remember.

308
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:45,480
I'll always be with you.

309
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:42,920
Feng Wu!

310
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:51,840
Master Mu?

311
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:56,040
Feng Wu.

312
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:57,000
Feng Wu.

313
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:58,720
Feng Wu.

314
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:06,200
Why?

315
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:08,360
Feng Wu.

316
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:18,840
Feng Wu.

317
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:34,080
Master.

318
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:35,840
Master.

319
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:37,240
You're finally awake.

320
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,040
Silly kid.

321
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,840
I've always been with you.

322
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:44,440
Wu.

323
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:46,200
Wu.

324
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:46,800
My Lady.

325
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:48,000
My Lady.

326
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:48,880
Wu.

327
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,680
Why are you here?

328
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:54,280
Your parents want you
to go home and have dinner.

329
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:55,800
I'm starving.

330
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:57,120
What did you just say?

331
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:58,160
My Lady.

332
00:20:58,280 --> 00:20:59,520
Master and Madam want you back home now.

333
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:00,520
Let's go.

334
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:01,760
Qiu Ling?

335
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:04,720
This is impossible.

336
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:05,960
Come on.

337
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:07,400
Let's go home.

338
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:12,120
Feng Wu.

339
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:12,920
Feng Wu.

340
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Your Highness Jun.

341
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:19,600
You can see me?

342
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,400
Then why did Feng Wu...

343
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:33,440
This is the void of inner demons.

344
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,840
Souls and souls don't cross paths.

345
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:38,000
It's normal that she can't see you.

346
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,240
Why didn't you warn Feng Wu

347
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:41,280
that this was an illusion?

348
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:45,640
It's not completely an illusion.

349
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,040
This Mirror

350
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,040
only provides a wonderful possibility.

351
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:52,800
If she indulges in this,

352
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:55,000
she won't make any progress.

353
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:01,800
I see.

354
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:05,400
Thank you for enlightening me.

355
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:38,880
Father?

356
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:49,840
My Lady, come on.

357
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,880
Sit down. Sit down.

358
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:52,720
Sit down.

359
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:53,720
Sit down.

360
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:57,120
Kid.

361
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:57,880
Here.

362
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,680
I have got a table

363
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,440
full of your favorite food.

364
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,360
Come on. Let's eat.

365
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,920
Feng Wu, eat up.

366
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:08,120
What's going on?

367
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:10,240
What do you mean, Feng Wu?

368
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,560
Your father prepared
all these dishes for you.

369
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:13,600
Eat up.

370
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:14,720
Mom.

371
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:15,920
Why are you...

372
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:17,440
My Lady.

373
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:18,920
Has too much sleep muddled your head?

374
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:21,120
Madam has always been like this.

375
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:23,560
Wu,

376
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:26,480
has cultivation worn you out?

377
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:28,760
You can relax for a while.

378
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,560
Have some rest.

379
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:32,560
Yes, Wu.

380
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:33,960
You shouldn't always stay at home.

381
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:36,160
His Highness Jun has sent
an invitation letter,

382
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:38,600
asking you to hang out at his place.

383
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:41,200
You should accept his invitation, Feng Wu.

384
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:44,160
Spend some time
to bond with His Highness Jun.

385
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,080
Right?

386
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:47,160
His Highness Jun is really thoughtful.

387
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:48,760
He knows your hobbies.

388
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:50,520
Wu,

389
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:52,200
I envy you so much.

390
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,600
If you marry him,

391
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,960
you'll be Spiritual Princess.

392
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:58,160
Spiritual Princess?

393
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:02,320
I thought Holy Queen Gao
favored Zuo Qingluan the most.

394
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:04,480
Zuo Qingluan is nothing.

395
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:05,400
Feng Wu,

396
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,760
you are Celestial Palace's Goddess

397
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,240
and Master Mu's successor.

398
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:12,520
Nobody can compete with you in this world.

399
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:13,840
Besides,

400
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:16,400
Holy Queen Gao favors you the most.

401
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,800
I'm Celestial Palace's Goddess?

402
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:23,560
Has too much work reeled your head?

403
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:26,400
You look dizzy.

404
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:29,160
What...

405
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,280
What is going on?

406
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:33,600
Feng Wu.

407
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:34,920
Wake up.

408
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:36,160
Feng Wu.

409
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:38,400
This is an illusion.

410
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,280
Your Highness Jun.

411
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:44,280
What's wrong?

412
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,400
When spring comes,

413
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:51,960
we should live in our old house

414
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,400
for a while.

415
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:55,440
-Oh yeah.
-Good!

416
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:57,760
Feng Wu has never visited the border before.

417
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:59,160
Right, Feng Wu?

418
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:00,840
Great. Great.

419
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,760
Of course I have visited the border.

420
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,080
New ointment.

421
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:10,560
Madam,

422
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:12,080
are you troubled by having a child
who cries non-stop at night?

423
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:13,480
-Try this ointment.
-No. I don't want it.

424
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:18,720
Madam, do you want the new ointment?

425
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:19,640
-It can treat injuries...
-No. No.

426
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:26,240
Mister, do you want the new ointment?

427
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,160
No. No.

428
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:31,840
My Lady,

429
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:33,640
a big drugstore has opened across the street.

430
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:35,240
Business has become slower for us.

431
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:38,000
Feng Wu.

432
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,320
Where is my Dragon Phoenix Spirit Ring?

433
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:51,560
No.

434
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:53,640
I'm here for the Dragon Phoenix Spirit Ring.

435
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:05,920
Come to get it. Come on.

436
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:06,840
Give it back to me!

437
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:07,400
Catch it.

438
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:08,200
Give it back to me!

439
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,320
Let's go.

440
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:20,200
Here you are.

441
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:21,320
Be careful next time.

442
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,440
Feng Wu.

443
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:26,440
You know me?

444
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:29,440
Eventually you're back.

445
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:30,680
Eh...

446
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:32,360
Feng Wu, wake up.

447
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:39,040
Higher. Higher.

448
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:42,600
-How is it? Is it fun?
-Higher.

449
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:44,520
Higher.

450
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,720
Feng Wu, wake up.

451
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:50,440
Feng Wu!

452
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:52,080
Feng Wu!

453
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:56,240
No.

454
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:57,760
Feng Wu, are you happy?

455
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:58,560
No.

456
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:01,560
-What's wrong, Feng Wu?
-Enough!

457
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:02,640
What's wrong, Feng Wu?

458
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:04,440
Don't you love

459
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:06,480
the whole family being together?

460
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:07,480
Yeah.

461
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:10,400
I love it.

462
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:13,520
Then why did you say no?

463
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,040
Feng Wu!

464
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:17,960
I heard it.

465
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:19,560
He's looking for me.

466
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:23,120
Jun Linyuan.

467
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:25,080
Jun Linyuan.

468
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:31,800
Jun Linyuan.

469
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:36,400
Feng Wu!

470
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,120
Jun Linyuan!

471
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:40,680
I'm coming!

472
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:06,760
My Phoenix Blood...

473
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:09,760
This is the battle between Feng Wu

474
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:12,200
and Zuo Qingluan
that happened three years ago.

475
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:16,000
There shouldn't be
two female geniuses in the capital.

476
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:17,760
I'm here already.

477
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:19,560
You are not needed.

478
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:22,200
If you keep what happened today
between us secret

479
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:24,680
and promise me not to return
to the capital in this life,

480
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:26,880
I will spare your life.

481
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,200
Not a chance!

482
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:29,880
Once I recover my cultivation base,

483
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:32,080
I'll take back the things
that were once mine.

484
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:33,200
Then I can't let you live

485
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:34,840
to cause me trouble.

486
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:31,000
Jun Linyuan.

487
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:46,840
I'm fine.

488
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:05,080
Feng Wu.

489
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:07,920
I lost to you in the end.

490
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:11,520
But Dragon Phoenix Spirit Ring

491
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:14,040
will disappear along with Illusion Mirror.

492
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:17,240
You'll never have what you want.

493
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,800
Never.

494
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:50,520
Senior Sister Zuo.

495
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:51,440
Boss Jun.

496
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:52,440
Boss Jun.

497
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:53,360
Senior Sister.

498
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:57,720
What exactly happened?

499
00:30:58,320 --> 00:30:59,240
Boss Jun broke into Illusion Mirror

500
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:00,640
to save you.

501
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:02,960
He took a stab for you
to break free from the illusion.

502
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:04,640
I'm fine.

503
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:07,000
Compared to not seeing you again,

504
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,320
this is nothing.

505
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,880
Why you torture yourself like this?

506
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:20,920
Junior Sister.

507
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,200
Don't be sad for me.

508
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:34,040

He spoke too fast. I couldn't keep up.

Let's sit there and study.

546

Yes.

I think we need more practice.

00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,800
Yeah. The Cultivation Method
is really abstruse.

549
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,230
Mu Jiuzhou really showed up?

550
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:14,710
Everyone in Junwu Academy saw him.

551
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:16,600
Master Mu

552
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:18,600
really came back to life.

You are dismissed.

554
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:30,630
Send people to watch Mu Jiuzhou closely.

555
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:32,440
See if there's anything wrong with him.

556
00:34:33,670 --> 00:34:34,320
Yes.

557
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:43,440
You are scared.

558
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,120
Scared?

559
00:34:50,230 --> 00:34:51,840
I'm worried about you.

00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:58,280
The past is in the past.

561
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:00,680
I'm just worrying that changes
might affect the plan

562
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:04,400
after someone from the past came back.

563
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:06,080
What should

564
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:07,920
we do now?

565
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:09,720
Wait.

566
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,120
We must find out

567
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:15,080
if Mu Jiuzhou is the same as he was

568
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:17,280
with an unmatched amount of spirit energy.

569
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:19,360
I don't think he'll reveal

570
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:22,840
his true amount of spirit energy.

571
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:24,800
Our plan

572
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:29,200
can't afford any delay.

573
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:31,880
Then we'll proceed as planned.

574
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,320
We'll find out his condition

575
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:35,880
from his reaction.

576
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:46,720
Boss Jun.

577
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:48,200
Here.

578
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:51,720
My Lady.

579
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:57,520
Master has gone to bed.

580
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:59,800
I think he is still a little weak

581
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:01,720
because he just recovered.

582
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:04,120
Master Zhao said

583
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:06,080
he needed to rest to recuperate.

584
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:20,520
I have something to tell you.

585
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:24,920
I'm sure you already know.

586
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:26,960
I am

587
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:29,640
not Feng Wu.

588
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:39,880
My Lady.

589
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:42,560
Do you recall anything else?

590
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:49,480
I'm sorry.

591
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,160
Actually,

592
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:54,040
I'm not Feng Wu.

593
00:36:57,120 --> 00:37:00,320
A voice in my mind keeps telling me that

594
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:02,720
I don't belong here.

595
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:05,080
In the end,

596
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:06,840
I may still

597
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:08,320
go back to where I belong.

598
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:11,400
I know it is unacceptable to you.

599
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:15,560
But I don't know why

600
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:19,080
I have just come here inexplicably

601
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:21,040
and

602
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:24,040
fallen in love with you unfathomably.

603
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:29,720
So,

604
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:32,040
you lied to me all this time.

605
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,320
Right?

606
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:37,360
I'm sorry, Zhao Ge, I...

607
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:40,840
I...

608
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:44,520
I thought of telling you the truth.

609
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:46,280
But I...

610
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:47,160
But you still chose

611
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:49,120
to lie to us like we were fools.

612
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:49,920
Right?

613
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:52,280
No.

614
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:58,240
No wonder you are so different

615
00:37:58,680 --> 00:37:59,960
from the younger Feng Wu.

616
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:09,720
It turns out Senior Sister

617
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:12,480
was right.

618
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:16,640
I was wrong to trust you.

619
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:30,800
You are not my Wu.

620
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:35,120
Zhao Ge.

621
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:58,080
Feng Wu.

622
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:00,960
Give her some time.

623
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:03,640
She will understand.

624
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:30,640
My Lady.

625
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:34,640
Qiu Ling.

626
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:36,080
I said

627
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:37,920
I'm not your lady.

628
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:44,440
I don't care.

629
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:46,200
I just know

630
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:49,840
you, Madam and I

631
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:51,960
depended on each other over the years.

632
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:53,560
I don't care what other people say.

633
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:54,960
I don't care what you think.

634
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:56,560
I just believe

635
00:39:57,240 --> 00:39:58,640
you are My Lady.

636
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:07,720
By the way,

637
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:09,200
how is mom?

638
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:12,000
Madam said she wanted to visit your bedroom.

639
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:13,440
I think she is there now.

640
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:15,960
My mom knows it.

641
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:18,160
No.

642
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:19,600
I must find her.

643
