00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:40,780
(Episode 26)

3
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:52,920
The five elements of  heavenly lightning
have come together.

4
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:55,000
You can't do anything over there.

5
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,160
Father,

6
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:59,000
this will be the last time I call you father.

7
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,480
I can't watch the girl I love

8
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,640
die like this.

9
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,200
I'll save her

10
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,840
even if it means going against you

11
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,600
and the whole Darknight Court.

12
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,080
Yu Mingye!

13
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:40,720
Yu Mingye!

14
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:41,440
Mingye!

15
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,120
Yu Mingye!

16
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,000
Don't come here.

17
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:54,640
Mingye!

18
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,160
Come out now, or you'll die in there!

19
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,160
Yu Mingye!

20
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,200
Don't come here.

21
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,120
All types of heavenly lightning
have come together.

22
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,640
Leave me here.

23
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:10,920
I swear by my name,

24
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:12,720
Feng Wu,

25
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:19,070
I won't let you die like this.

26
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:22,920
No.

27
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,400
Don't come here.

28
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,440
Don't come here.

29
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,480
Don't come here.

30
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,200
Mingye!

31
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,080
Yu Mingye!

32
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,160
Mingye!

33
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:17,680
Jun Linyuan.

34
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:21,280
Don't make any more sacrifices for me.

35
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,520
The Heaven Slaying Sword
doesn't fear the heavenly lightning!

36
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,840
Don't be afraid. You have got me.

37
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,240
No. No.

38
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,800
Jun Linyuan!

39
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:48,760
Boss Jun!

40
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:49,520
Wu!

41
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:30,920
Feng Wu!

42
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,480
Master!

43
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:18,600
Feng Wu,

44
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,640
does it hurt?

45
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,000
Yes.

46
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:23,680
It hurts very much.

47
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,720
The pain is suffocating.

48
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,280
For whom do you ache?

49
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:29,800
Jun Linyuan?

50
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,720
Not just him.

51
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:34,240
My friends

52
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,360
bore misfortunes for me.

53
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,550
And I can't do anything.

54
00:08:39,550 --> 00:08:40,520
Master,

55
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:43,360
why did I come to this world?

56
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,440
Would my friends be free of misfortune

57
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,680
if I was gone?

58
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,160
This world doesn't change

59
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:00,120
just because one person exists or vanishes.

60
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,640
You came here

61
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:04,240
to continue your own story.

62
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:06,000
But this isn't my story.

63
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,160
I'm not Feng Wu.

64
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,360
I'm not her.

65
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,040
Are you sure?

66
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:15,520
I...

67
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,480
Master.

68
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,640
Is your spirit energy very strong?

69
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,120
Little girl,

70
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,920
cultivators should always keep in mind

71
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,080
that even if they possess

72
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,360
enough spirit energy

73
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,040
to dominate the continent,

74
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,200
they must not use their spirit energy

75
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,920
to do evil deeds.

76
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,480
I wish to follow you.

77
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:21,920
I have always been
mocked for being fatherless.

78
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,840
I want to increase my spirit energy

79
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,760
to protect my beautiful mom very much.

80
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:26,760
I swear

81
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:29,400
I will use my cultivation base
to do good deeds.

82
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,240
Take me as your disciple, please.

83
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:35,000
The fact that you found
the Dragon Phoenix Spirit Ring

84
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:37,200
proves that there is a link between us.

85
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:48,360
Kid,

86
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:50,360
I will take you

87
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,760
as my disciple.

88
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:36,000
Who are you?

89
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,440
Is my life

90
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:53,680
painful to live?

91
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:56,720
But all this

92
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,880
isn't meaningless.

93
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:00,400
They got hurt

94
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,320
because of me.

95
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,920
But you made them happy.

96
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,680
The people around you,

97
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:09,240
including Jun Linyuan, Yu Mingye,

98
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,440
Feng Xun, Xuan Yi,

99
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:12,600
and Zhao Ge,

100
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,560
are real.

101
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:16,120
Because of you,

102
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,160
they came together again,

103
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:20,080
went through sorrows and joys,

104
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:21,920
grew and changed.

105
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:24,360
It's not Feng Wu's story.

106
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,960
It's your story.

107
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,240
It's our story.

108
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:29,600
I...

109
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:30,920
Don't run away.

110
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:32,960
Don't question your destiny.

111
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,280
Cherish the people around you.

112
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:56,080
Use your power to protect them.

113
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,600
But I replaced you.

114
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,400
Don't you hate me?

115
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:02,120
You didn't replace me.

116
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:03,600
I'm Feng Wu.

117
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:04,680
You are also Feng Wu.

118
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,440
Perhaps we would have made

119
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,320
different choices.

120
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:11,480
But it is what it is.

121
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,920
Don't question your choices.

122
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:15,760
Understood?

123
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:22,080
One more thing.

124
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:23,360
Take care of our mother.

125
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,400
Tell her

126
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,760
to eat more

127
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:29,680
and cover herself properly at night.

128
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:34,600
I'll leave the rest to you.

129
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:37,480
The rest?

130
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:59,120
Go.

131
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:06,400
Is this

132
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,160
Master's handwriting?

133
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:34,680
Demon.

134
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:35,920
You are not to run wild!

135
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,960
Senior Sister, let me help you.

136
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,280
I told you to return to the Celestial Palace.

137
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,240
Why did you come here?

138
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:52,960
Senior Sister,

139
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:54,600
I couldn't leave you here alone.

140
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,200
Watch out!

141
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,120
Don't drop your guard.

142
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,000
Surround her.

143
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:32,880
What...

144
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:34,560
What is going on?

145
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,160
This girl

146
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,120
actually survived the tribulation,

147
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:49,880
skipped a rank, and became a Spiritual Elder.

148
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,200
Yu Mingye.

149
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,280
You are useless now.

150
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:08,400
The Darknight Court

151
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:13,400
hereby cuts ties with you.

152
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:16,680
Watch out

153
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,160
for yourself.

154
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:35,520
My Lord.

155
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:36,840
Let's go.

156
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:37,840
Yes.

157
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,220
-Boss Jun.
-Boss Jun.

158
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:01,760
Wu.

159
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:13,000
Wu, wake up.

160
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:21,280
Wu, you are awake.

161
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:26,920
Boss Jun.

162
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:29,680
Come on.

163
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:35,040
Jun Linyuan.

164
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:39,040
Silly girl.

165
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:40,520
I'm fine.

166
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:45,640
You are not hurt, are you?

167
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,080
Yu Mingye.

168
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:18,160
Feng Wu.

169
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:19,600
Don't cry.

170
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:22,440
I'm sorry.

171
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:24,360
Yu Mingye.

172
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:27,080
Don't blame yourself.

173
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:29,600
It's my choice.

174
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:32,520
If it happened again,

175
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:35,160
I would make the same choice.

176
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:46,400
You are severely wounded.

177
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:48,560
Where are you going?

178
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:51,880

Senior Sister.

Damn it.

226
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:20,520
Senior Sister.

227
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:21,800
I told you

228
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:23,160
not to come in without my permission.

229
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:27,520
Senior Sister.

230
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:31,280
That's not the Celestial Palace's
cultivation method.

231
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:32,840
Are you practicing

232
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:35,280
Demonic Cultivation Skills?

233
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:36,920
I need you to pretend

234
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:38,440
you saw nothing today.

235
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:42,240
The Celestial Palace has always
considered itself a righteous sect.

236
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:45,920
Master looks down

237
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:47,720
on the devious tricks.

238
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,040
I did all this

239
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:54,760
for the Celestial Palace.

240
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:59,040
Do you want me to lose to Feng Wu?

241
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:01,600
I'm Zuo Qingluan,

242
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,720
the Celestial Palace's goddess,

243
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:06,920
Junwu Clan's future Spiritual Princess.

244
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:10,200
No.

245
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,640
That has nothing to do
with this, Senior Sister.

246
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:14,840
Please come around.

247
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:16,200
You are practicing
Demonic Cultivation Skills.

248
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:19,400
Even the Darknight Court keeps

249
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:20,760
these Demonic Cultivation Skills
to themselves.

250
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:21,520
Senior Sister.

251
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:23,600
These skills just backfired on you.

252
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:26,560
Why are you sticking to the wrong way?

253
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,360
I own this spirit energy

254
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:34,480
and I decide how it will be used.

255
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:36,240
Senior Sister.

256
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:40,000
Since I joined the Celestial Palace,

257
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:43,560
I've been seeing you as my role model

258
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:46,560
and admiring you the most.

259
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,680
I listened to every word you said.

260
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:53,280
I followed you no matter
what choices you made.

261
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:55,040
But I can't

262
00:26:58,440 --> 00:26:59,280
do it this time.

263
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:01,240
If this goes on,

264
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:03,880
you'll deviate from the right track,
Senior Sister.

265
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:08,120
I can't watch you go astray.

266
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:16,960
I'm going back to the Celestial Palace

267
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:19,240
and report to Master.

268
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:21,800
She'll know how to save you.

269
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:23,960
Mu Yao,

270
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:26,640
do you know what consequences will ensue

271
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:29,680
if you tell Master about this?

272
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:38,160
Even if you get expelled from the sect,

273
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,560
I'll follow you.

274
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:42,480
I'm willing to do anything

275
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,960
to save you and drag you back

276
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:48,360
from the wrong track.

277
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:49,280
Mu Yao!

278
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,040
Senior Sister.

279
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:10,520
I'm sorry.

280
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:12,520
I'm sorry.

281
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:17,040
Why didn't you listen to me?

282
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:21,120
Like you had done before.

283
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,400
Before?

284
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:11,400
Zhao Ge.

285
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:18,720
Zhao Ge has gone back to the capital.

286
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:24,600
Senior Sister.

287
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:26,640
You looked beautiful
when you were practicing swordsmanship.

288
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:28,440
Are you new here?

289
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:33,280
I have been here for months.

290
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:34,760
I'm not new anymore.

291
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:37,160
When Master taught us,

292
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:38,600
I was near you

293
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:40,160
with only two people between us.

294
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,040
Why are you following me?

295
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:57,080
Senior Sister.

296
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:59,360
You are the fastest growing

297
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:01,000
cultivator here I've ever seen.

298
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:03,320
Master often commended
your talent and wisdom.

299
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:04,600
If you envy me,

300
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:06,360
then spend more time practicing.

301
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:08,040
Stop following me.

302
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:13,520
Senior Sister, I do envy you.

303
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:17,320
No.

304
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:20,080
I actually envy Zhao Ge more.

305
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:23,760
After my mom passed away,

306
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:26,000
I was sent here,

307
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:28,360
and I don't think I can go back.

308
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:30,440
Senior Sister.

309
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:32,160
Can I follow you from now on?

310
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:34,880
I promise not to cause you trouble.

311
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,120
You can just...

312
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:38,240
You can just bring me along
like you brought Zhao Ge along.

313
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:42,440
Fine.

314
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:43,760
You can follow me.

315
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:52,960
Are these Mujian Flowers?

316
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:54,560
They are so pretty.

317
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:13,240
Senior Sister.

318
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,360
Have the Mujian Flowers
of the Celestial Palace bloomed?

319
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:26,000
Mu Yao!

320
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:21,280
Stop!

321
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:53,880
You are all cultivators.

322
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:56,080
Your duty is to uphold justice
and eliminate demons.

323
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:58,200
But you are using your spirit energy
to resolve internal conflict.

324
00:33:58,320 --> 00:33:59,880
This is not a wise move.

325
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,320
I understand

326
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:02,600
that you have doubts about me.

327
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:05,000
But please don't let people use you.

328
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:06,960
The actual situation is
different from the rumor.

329
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:09,670
There's a terrible plot behind all this.

330
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:10,880
I can't clarify things

331
00:34:11,150 --> 00:34:12,760
in a short time.

332
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:14,920
But please use your brain.

333
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:17,190
The Jun Linyuan you know,

334
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:19,630
the dignified Crown Prince of Junwu Clan,

335
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:22,560
has always been just, impartial,
restrained and rule-abiding.

336
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:25,320
Why would he want to hurt
the Holy Sovereign and Holy Queen?

337
00:34:25,670 --> 00:34:27,880
How did His Highness Jun
become the man he is today?

338
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:29,190
Isn't the answer obvious?

339
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:31,520
Because you witch enchanted him.

340
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:32,920
Stop making excuses.

341
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:35,480
The fact that you are protecting the demon

342
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:37,080
proves my words.

343
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:40,230
If you kill the demon,

344
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:41,440
I'll believe you.

345
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:42,280
You...

346
00:34:43,630 --> 00:34:44,320
Feng Wu.

347
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:47,960
I know you can understand me now.

348
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:53,670
Miss Wolf.

349
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:54,760
What happened to you?

350
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:07,880
Why did you...

351
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:11,080
Do it.

352
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:12,600
Kill me.

353
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:15,680
You are asking me to kill you?

354
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:19,920
Why?

355
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:39,920
Don't force me!

356
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:02,000
My destiny has been fulfilled.

357
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:04,880
I'm finally

358
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:09,600
free.

359
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:24,560
I didn't expect her to kill the demon.

360
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:27,760
Did we really judge them wrong?

361
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:30,840
Wu.

362
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:34,040
Miss Wolf.

363
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:14,760
It turns out this Star Shard

364
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:18,040
was your destiny for over twenty years.

365
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:27,560
You people

366
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:29,560
may have a cultivation base,

367
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:32,400
but you can't tell right from wrong.

368
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,160
So what if you have a cultivation base?

369
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:36,320
You don't deserve to be cultivators.

370
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:42,680
It's a trap set by Holy Queen Gao.

371
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:44,760
She colluded with the Darknight Court.

372
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:46,720
Now she has imprisoned the Holy Sovereign.

373
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:49,160
She's using you
to eliminate everyone in her way

374
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:51,200
and seeking to take control
of the whole Qianyuan Continent.

375
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:53,040
Don't let her fool you.

376
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:55,880
Don't stick to the wrong way.

377
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:57,280
Holy Queen Gao will turn
her sword's point at you

378
00:38:58,080 --> 00:39:00,240
once we leave.

379
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:01,760
When that time comes,

380
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:04,200
Junwu Academy won't be able to save you.

381
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:06,960
Even Penglai Pavilion and Celestial Palace

382
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:08,080
will fall victim

383
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:09,520
to the Darknight Court.

384
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:10,480
Nonsense.

385
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:12,240
Have you got evidence?

386
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:14,320
I have.

387
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:22,600
Let me return to Junwu Academy

388
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:24,120
and take back my Dragon Phoenix Spirit Ring.

389
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:26,440
Then I'll use the three Star Shards

390
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:28,640
to wake up my Master Mu Jiuzhou.

391
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:30,200
Her Master is Mu Jiuzhou?

392
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:31,560
No way.

393
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:35,840
My Master used to dominate this Continent.

394
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:37,760
He knew everything.

395
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:39,480
You will believe

396
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:41,200
his words, won't you?

397
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:46,920
I believe her.

398
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:51,160
I believe Feng Wu.

399
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:52,920
I would like to return with her
to prove her words.

400
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:55,600
I believe her too.

401
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:57,160
I believe her.

402
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:00,280
I believe her too.

403
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:01,400
I believe her too.

404
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:02,360
I believe her too.

405
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:03,560
I believe her too.

406
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:04,400
And me.

407
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:05,240
And me.

408
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:06,760
I believe her too.

409
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:07,800
And me.
