=Dance of the Phoenix=

2
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:40,580
(Episode 7)

3
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,480
If you want to fight one-on-one,

4
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:49,880
let's do it.

5
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,720
But, if I win,

6
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,560
you need to tell me

7
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:54,920
why you place a spy

8
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,400
around me!

9
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:57,480
Okay.

10
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:00,080
Let's see if you can really
get the chance to win.

11
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,000
I...

12
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:17,750
You...

13
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,120
How dare you!

14
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,880
It's you who struck the first blow.

15
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:22,440
Jun Linyuan,

16
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:23,840
you're not focused even when you're fighting.

17
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,160
You're looking down upon me.

18
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:30,880
If you are not serious with the fight,

19
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:31,880
you'd lose your life.

20
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:39,160
You're always thinking yourself
beautiful and talkative.

21
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:42,520
Today I'm gonna cut your face.

22
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:46,280
I wanna see how you hook up
with His Highness Jun again.

23
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:47,680
Stop!

24
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,880
Miss Liu, you've gone too far!

25
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:55,840
Madam,

26
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,440
it's your daughter who has gone too far.

27
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,720
She is a person of no cultivation base

28
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,800
and she covers up all truth
from my brother and me.

29
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:03,800
Enough.

30
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:05,960
Feng Wu, are you okay?

31
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,320
Feng Yiran,

32
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,800
stop pretending to be a good person.

33
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:12,200
If you really want to be a good person,

34
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,720
you should get out of here

35
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,280
with your idiot sister.

36
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:18,040
What did you say?

37
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:42,760
Stop it!

38
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:43,560
Get out of my way.

39
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,520
You like herbal medicine.

40
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,320
I'm gonna burn all your stuff.

41
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,560
I wanna see how you continue to pretend.

42
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,120
No.

43
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,080
You...

44
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:00,080
How dare you hook up with His Highness Jun!

45
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,240
You...

46
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:09,840
You...

47
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,360
Feng Wu.

48
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,280
Mom.

49
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,480
Mom. No.

50
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:24,480
I will fight you to the end.

51
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,320
Boss Jun.

52
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,560
You're not even in the same league as I am.

53
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,840
There's no point in fighting against you.

54
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,120
I gotta go.

55
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,240
Forget about that.

56
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,480
Something is wrong in the front courtyard.

57
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:51,280
Go check it out.

58
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,360
Feng Wu.

59
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,040
Mom.

60
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:11,920
Mom.

61
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:15,400
Does it hurt?

62
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:29,520
Feng Wu.

63
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,400
Feng Wu.

64
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,360
-Feng Wu.
-My Lady.

65
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:49,030
-My Lady.
-Feng Wu.

66
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,560
Phoenix Sword.

67
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:57,640
What did you say?

68
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:02,680
Phoenix Sword comes out
to look for its owner.

69
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,720
But it chose her.

70
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,160
That doesn't make any sense.

71
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:11,360
Feng Liu.

72
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:19,880
My Lady.

73
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,280
Feng Wu and Madam both got hurt.

74
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:29,520
What do you want to do?

75
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,480
Both of you

76
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,560
are taking advantage of
a person of no cultivation base.

77
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:38,040
Don't you feel ashamed?

78
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:49,440
Your Highness Jun.

79
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,240
Your Highness Jun.
There's some misunderstanding.

80
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,920
I know that my sister has gone too far.

81
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:53,960
I was just about to stop her.

82
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,000
Remember that

83
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:56,560
if a strong person

84
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,480
can order a weak person to do anything,

85
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,120
then at this place

86
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,480
the only person that can determine your fate

87
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,800
is me.

88
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:18,060
(Simple and Incorruptible)

89
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,320
Mom.

90
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:05,600
Mom.

91
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,560
How can I get you
into this dangerous situation

92
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,840
just because I don't believe you?

93
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,200
Even though you lost Phoenix Blood,

94
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:49,120
you should not put yourself
under anyone's thumb like this.

95
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,040
As time goes by,

96
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,200
you'll be looked down upon by other people.

97
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,240
Today Phoenix Sword chose you as its owner.

98
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,240
Since you don't agree on
the secular rules in this world,

99
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,840
you should try to be a strong person.

100
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,120
Are you really...

101
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:51,640
My Lady, you should get better quickly.

102
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,800
It belongs to Yu Mingye.

103
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:10,920
Feng Wu,

104
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,240
how many things about you are there
that I still don't know?

105
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:37,800
Hail to you, Your Majesty.

106
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:43,600
Your Majesty,

107
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,280
His Highness Jun isn't back yet.

108
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:48,880
We don't know what's wrong with him.

109
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:53,640
It's good that Crown Prince is a devoted son.

110
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,920
But he's gone for so long.

111
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,440
I don't know

112
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,320
if everything is okay with him.

113
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:01,120
Your Majesty, you're kind-hearted.

114
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:03,920
If His Highness Jun knows
you're worrying about him,

115
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,440
(Great Spiritual Master Yan)
he will surely come back to the capital soon.

116
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:23,360
Every Great Spiritual Master here,

117
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:26,320
do you have anything to discuss?

118
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,720
Since March this year,

119
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,360
many people from villages in the south

120
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,800
were reported to have been
attacked by demonic beasts.

121
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,680
Panic immediately swept through the area,

122
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:38,880
with no businessman or traveler
willing to go there.

123
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,120
I hereby beg Your Majesty

124
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:44,160
to order East Governor and his cultivators
to kill the demonic beasts,

125
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:45,960
thus letting people
live a peaceful life again.

126
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:50,560
Do you have any other ideas?

127
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:52,840
Your Majesty,

128
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,880
I think we'd better

129
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,520
pick an obedient cultivator in the capital

130
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:00,040
and order him to lead everyone
to kill the demonic beasts.

131
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:03,360
I think Your Majesty's nephew Gao Wei,

132
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:04,720
who is a young and courageous

133
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:06,960
senior-rank spiritual practitioner now,

134
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,760
can be entrusted with this important task.

135
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:10,200
Gao Wei

136
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,680
is still young.

137
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:15,440
I'm afraid he might not
be trusted by everyone.

138
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,720
I am supportive of that proposal.

139
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,680
Gao Wei is the best candidate

140
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,800
for this job.

141
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,080
I agree.

142
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:28,400
Your Majesty,

143
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,520
what's your opinion of it?

144
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,760
I don't care.

145
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:36,360
Then

146
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:38,080
it's all set.

147
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:41,920
In a few days,

148
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:43,640
I will get in practice in seclusion.

149
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:46,120
But Crown Prince hasn't come back
to the capital yet.

150
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:47,960
So can you recommend someone

151
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:51,080
that we can entrust with the important job of

152
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:54,440
filling my shoes
and managing the affairs of the clan?

153
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:57,080
Your Majesty,

154
00:15:57,280 --> 00:16:00,240
now all the Elders and Masters
are living at different places.

155
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:03,400
Most of the new Great Spiritual Masters

156
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:05,200
are not fully-fledged for the job.

157
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,360
So I suggest that

158
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:09,000
Her Majesty do the work for you.

159
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,560
That doesn't make sense.

160
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,440
I am just a woman.

161
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:20,120
I can only

162
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:22,160
perform simple tasks.

163
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:24,840
It's impossible for me
to handle the affairs of the clan.

164
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:26,840
I agree that

165
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,840
Her Majesty is the best candidate.

166
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,800
Hopefully you can share
His Majesty's heavy burden.

167
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:34,760
I agree.

168
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:42,760
Okay. Her Majesty,

169
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:46,520
since they all recommend you,

170
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:49,200
you'd better take the job.

171
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:50,680
Yes.

172
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:57,120
Since all of you have recommended me,

173
00:16:57,560 --> 00:17:00,800
I cannot but take this job.

174
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:02,680
Wait a second.

175
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:09,800
I can't believe this.
Spiritual Elder Fang has come.

176
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,310
Hail to you, Your Majesty.

177
00:17:21,070 --> 00:17:22,000
Your Majesty.

178
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:23,640
Spiritual Elder Fang,

179
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:27,350
what brought you here?

180
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,070
You've been living a peaceful life
in your hometown these years.

181
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,520
How are you?

182
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,520
I'm grateful for Your Majesty's blessing.

183
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:36,480
I'm very well.

184
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,680
I came to the capital
this time particularly to

185
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,080
help Your Majesty out.

186
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,200
Everything is okay in the clan.

187
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:46,560
What do you mean by saying...

188
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:49,400
I took the order from His Highness Jun

189
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,320
and was entrusted with the job of

190
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,360
handling different affairs in the clan.

191
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:55,640
That's great.

192
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,600
If you are here,

193
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:01,320
I can get in practice in seclusion
without anything to worry about.

194
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,880
You were entrusted by Crown Prince?

195
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:09,000
His Highness Jun
is considerate of Your Majesty.

196
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:10,640
He ordered me to come back

197
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:13,400
and help Your Majesty solve problems.

198
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,320
I see.

199
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:16,640
That's good.

200
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,640
It just worries me to think

201
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:21,360
how to handle all the affairs in the clan.

202
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:24,360
Luckily, you are back.

203
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:27,760
Now I can breathe a sigh of relief.

204
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:37,920
Mom.

205
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:39,840
My Lady.

206
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:41,840
My Lady, you are conscious.

207
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:44,960
Does your hand still hurt?

208
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46,480
Where is mom?

209
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,040
Madam is fine.

210
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:49,160
She has just come back to rest.

211
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:57,280
Madam has taken medicine.

212
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:58,080
She is fine.

213
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,800
You should also get more rest.

214
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:01,600
My Lady.

215
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:06,080
My Lady.

216
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,960
Why are you doing this?

217
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:11,680
Goddess Zuo.

218
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:14,680
It's all my fault and I've got what I deserve.

219
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,080
Could you forgive me this time?

220
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,440
It's not related to my forgiving you.

221
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:27,560
I know that

222
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,800
you really admire Crown Prince.

223
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:31,560
So sometimes you're a little impatient.

224
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,480
You'd better have a clear picture of it.

225
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,240
You don't need to this.

226
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:42,520
But you've gone so far this time that

227
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:44,400
you even made such a serious attack
against Feng Wu.

228
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,400
Yes.

229
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,320
I've learned my lesson.

230
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:50,200
I'll always follow your advice from now on.

231
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:52,120
I won't cross the line again.

232
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:00,640
This time I come back,

233
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:02,440
I notice that Feng Wu is very different

234
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:03,920
from what she used to be in childhood.

235
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,400
I haven't seen her for a long time.

236
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:10,040
I don't know

237
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:12,840
how her life is on the border.

238
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:26,720
Mom.

239
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,000
Does it hurt?

240
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,920
It's all my fault.

241
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:37,320
You often tell me

242
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:39,560
not to act rashly.

243
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,080
But I never listen to your words.

244
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:44,880
I always think I can
get things done on my own.

245
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:47,600
So this time I got you in trouble.

246
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,240
It doesn't matter.

247
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:54,040
Feng Wu, I'm fine.

248
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:55,480
As to you,

249
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:58,640
you should thank His Highness Jun.

250
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:00,840
Jun Linyuan?

251
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
No.

252
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:05,880
But for him,

253
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,320
Feng Liu wouldn't have gotten me in trouble.

254
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:09,720
Feng Wu.

255
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:11,880
Listen to me.

256
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:14,480
It'd be good if you could
regain your cultivation base.

257
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:16,680
You can thus do what you want to do.

258
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:21,360
But keep in mind that
never be controlled by hatred.

259
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:27,120
Phoenix Sword

260
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,480
used to belong to your father.

261
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:36,080
I haven't seen it for many years.

262
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:39,920
Since the sword chose you

263
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:43,160
by a strange twist of fate,

264
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,440
you should keep it safe.

265
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:54,960
Your Highness,

266
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:57,240
there is some misunderstanding today.

267
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:00,400
Misunderstanding?

268
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:03,040
Even though Feng Wu is down and out now,

269
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,320
she shouldn't have been treated like this.

270
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,280
You have gone too far.

271
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:07,880
You must be punished.

272
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:08,680
Boss Jun,

273
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:11,800
why not leave them
to demonic beasts in the wilderness?

274
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:14,040
They can even increase
their cultivation base there.

275
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:16,520
Young Master Feng, I beg to differ.

276
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:18,680
Even though they both
have done something wrong,

277
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:20,400
their spirit energy is not strong enough

278
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:24,120
to protect themselves
when encountering superior demonic beasts.

279
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:25,360
The Feng family

280
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,520
is a distinguished family in the capital.

281
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,480
We should not punish them too harshly.

282
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:31,280
Women are really

283
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:33,600
soft-hearted.

284
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:35,680
Even though His Majesty
encourages cultivation,

285
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:37,960
he also promotes
equality of all living things.

286
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,840
You are both cultivators,

287
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,880
but you bullied a person of
no cultivation base before so many people

288
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:45,280
and even kept talking nonsense
in the name of His Majesty.

289
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,600
Your Highness.

290
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:49,000
We beg you to forgive us.

291
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:50,680
We will surely keep it in mind.

292
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:51,960
We promise that we won't do it again.

293
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:54,200
Yes, Your Highness.

294
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:55,680
Please consider the fact that

295
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:57,440
the Feng family has been working so hard

296
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:58,400
for the sake of Junwu Clan.

297
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:00,600
We should be given some credit
for hard work if not for merit.

298
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,720
Please forgive us this time.

299
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:04,680
Considering the fact that
it was your first offence

300
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,840
and little damage was caused,

301
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:09,560
I will cut you some slack.

302
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,440
We appreciate it very much, Your Highness.

303
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:18,360
You can stand up.

304
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:26,160
Do you mean that we're giving you
a hard time deliberately?

305
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,520
No. Definitely not.

306
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:30,760
But punishment cannot be spared.

307
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:44,960
I just lowered your spirit energy
as a warning this time.

308
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:47,920
Hopefully, you will learn your lesson
and correct your mistake.

309
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:50,000
Don't ever bully other people

310
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:51,360
just because you have some cultivation base.

311
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:52,960
Feng Liu.

312
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:54,560
You are too aggressive.

313
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:57,880
Thunder Spell will bring thunder
down from the sky

314
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,200
whenever you want to talk dirty words.

315
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:01,320
Hopefully you will know what you should do

316
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:02,840
and be kind to others.

317
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,320
Your Highness,

318
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:15,000
we gotta go.

319
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:17,720
Let's go.

320
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:32,360
My Lady,

321
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:34,440
this is the first time

322
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:36,360
I see Eldest Young Master
and Sixth Young Lady

323
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:38,080
so embarrassed.

324
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,200
It serves them right.

325
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:42,880
He gets what a bad person should get.

326
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:52,480
Come in.

327
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,960
Boss Jun has already known
that you are listening in.

328
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:21,960
Feng Wu.

329
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:23,640
Long time no see.

330
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:25,960
I killed Hundred Poison Beast.

331
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:27,000
After that,
if I hadn't returned to the border

332
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:30,120
to make humble efforts
to help His Highness Jun,

333
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:32,880
I wouldn't have run into you
when you are in danger.

334
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,360
I appreciate it very much.

335
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:36,640
You deserve to be
eldest sister of Celestial Palace.

336
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,000
You are not only beautiful but also kind.

337
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:41,960
I have just thought that

338
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:43,560
we have special pills in Celestial Palace,

339
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:44,880
which is greatly effective to burns.

340
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,040
I'll get some and give them to your mom.

341
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:08,240
How did you know that I was outside?

342
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:11,000
We all heard you chuckling at other people's
embarrassment outside the door.

343
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:13,920
You thought we wouldn't hear the sound
when you cover your mouth, didn't you?

344
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:15,240
You...

345
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,280
Anyway.

346
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,680
Since you helped me out,

347
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,840
I don't want to argue with you
when you're putting on a poker face.

348
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:23,640
Poker face?

349
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:25,120
Look at me.

350
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:26,960
I am very ugly,

351
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:28,560
so I don't want to get married.

352
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:29,680
Otherwise

353
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:31,040
I'd rather choose you as my partner

354
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:33,440
than Jun Linyuan,
who is always putting on a poker face.

355
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:34,680
Nor will I choose Xuan Yi,
who has two bulging eyes.

356
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:39,600
Poker face?

357
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:42,400
Is this word popular around the border area?

358
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:44,640
Yes.

359
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:46,720
The people on the border
always say this word,

360
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,080
don't they, Qiu Ling?

361
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:58,280
By the way,

362
00:26:58,480 --> 00:26:59,560
my mom

363
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:01,120
asked me to thank you.

364
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:04,440
So could you give me the chance
to make something for you?

365
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:21,520
What are you doing, My Lady?

366
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,120
Today

367
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,800
I'm gonna see how much
spirit energy I still have.

368
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:28,720
Attention, please.

369
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:45,880
Anything happens?

370
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:46,840
Is there any fire?

371
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:48,560
No.

372
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:56,880
It's choking.

373
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:02,800
Phoenix Sword is known to set a fire.

374
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:05,400
But why can't I do anything with it now?

375
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:33,280
What's this?

376
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,320
My Lady says it's called Phoenix Tea.

377
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:37,600
Phoenix Tea?

378
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:44,280
It's so good.

379
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:45,800
Qiu Ling, is there anything else?

380
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:47,280
Where is Feng Wu?

381
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:48,480
I can help her.

382
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:50,720
She took some tea to Goddess Zuo.

383
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:52,680
She said that if you wanted more,

384
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:54,000
she would make it for you next time.

385
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:55,000
Okay. Okay.

386
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:03,920
Besides that,

387
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:05,400
what else can Feng Wu make?

388
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:08,400
I got to drink her Dirty Tea,

389
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:10,520
pearl milk tea and honey pomelo tea.

390
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,880
Each tastes really good.

391
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:17,680
Looks like there're many things
that we don't know about Feng Wu.

392
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:31,160
Your Highness,

393
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:33,720
you have business to do.
I don't want to bother you anymore.

394
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,360
I gotta go.

395
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,080
What's up, Boss Jun?

396
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:53,840
Do we have trouble in the capital again?

397
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:54,920
No.

398
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:57,040
Because of Spiritual Elder Fang,

399
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,560
they start to get out of the bad situation.

400
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:01,320
Xuan Yi,

401
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:02,640
thank you.

402
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:05,200
Grandfather is always
concerned with Junwu Clan.

403
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:06,680
So he must be willing to

404
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:08,160
help you out this time.

405
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:09,320
Yes. Boss Jun.

406
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:11,440
Then what are you still worrying about?

407
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:14,440
His Majesty really expects me
to take back Celestial Fruit.

408
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:17,120
But now what I can give him
is only disappointment.

409
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:23,820
If I don't guess wrong,

410
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:25,900
what's the relation

411
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:28,900
between all of this and Darknight Court?

412
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:47,600
It's good.

413
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:48,800
Thank you for the tea.

414
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:51,840
It's good that you like it.

415
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:53,480
Thank you for saving us.

416
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:55,000
Without your pills,

417
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:57,120
my mom wouldn't have recovered so soon.

418
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:58,720
You call me

419
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:00,080
Goddess Zuo?

420
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:01,440
What's wrong?

421
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:03,160
Is there any problem?

422
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:05,760
I know that they all call you Goddess Zuo.

423
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:07,040
I just follow suit.

424
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:10,520
Do I offend you?

425
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:12,760
No.

426
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:14,400
I just feel that

427
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:17,840
you're very different from
what you used to be.

428
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:21,160
Yes.

429
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:25,360
Even my mom and Qiu Ling say that

430
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:27,520
I've changed a lot.

431
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:29,520
But

432
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,360
the incident three years ago

433
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:32,920
was a matter of life and death.

434
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:35,520
How many people can remain the same

435
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:37,680
after experiencing that?

436
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:41,800
They might, at least, change a bit.

437
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:51,080
So

438
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:54,200
do you really

439
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:56,160
forget all of the past?

440
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:00,120
I've forgotten most of the past.

441
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:01,880
But it's not a big deal.

442
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:04,040
I come to the border with mom.

443
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:06,200
It's a new place and new life.

444
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,520
Every day I sell herbal medicine

445
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:09,880
and keep my mom company.

446
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:11,320
I live a full life.

447
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:14,280
And you're happy with your life.

448
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:16,600
That's good.

449
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:21,360
Oh, I haven't prepared herbal medicine yet.

450
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:22,480
I gotta go.

451
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:37,480
Enough!

452
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:39,000
Don't get so angry.

453
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:40,000
You're making such a big noise.

454
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:42,200
If His Highness Jun hears it,
he will blame you again.

455
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:44,440
It's all because of that stupid Feng Wu!

456
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:54,100
(Dwelling of Leisurely Elegance)

457
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:56,720
We really misjudged the situation this time.

458
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:57,920
It never occurred to me that

459
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:59,200
they would be partial to Feng Wu.

460
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:00,800
If we were at the capital,

461
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:02,640
even ten Feng Wus were no match for us.

462
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:04,840
Feng Wu has Phoenix Sword now.

463
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:06,600
What are we gonna do?

464
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:12,320
Goddess Zuo.

465
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:14,240
Taking Phoenix Sword away by force

466
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:15,520
doesn't make any sense.

467
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:17,640
You should think of some other ways.

468
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,560
These pills are from Celestial Palace.

469
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:24,360
You can recover your spirit energy
after taking them.

470
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:40,360
Do you feel that

471
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,600
Feng Wu is a little different?

472
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:44,520
Different?

473
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:46,680
Since childhood,

474
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:48,440
she has always been annoying like this.

475
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:51,400
It seems that

476
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,200
she is...

477
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:55,920
Do you mean that she seems not to know
who you are?

478
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,640
You left the Feng family to practice
cultivation when you were a child.

479
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:04,200
How did you know this?

480
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:07,040
I asked around the other day.

481
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:09,280
It is said that

482
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:10,840
since Feng Wu lost
cultivation base three years ago,

483
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:12,240
she seemed to have forgotten many things.

484
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:13,760
Besides, she behaved in a peculiar way.

485
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:17,230
Perhaps she got so upset that
she had a different disposition.

486
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:20,150
Looks like she didn't lie to me.

487
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:21,520
She did forget who I am.

488
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:23,840
Brother,

489
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:26,520
you seem to be really concerned with Feng Wu.

490
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,120
Shut up!

491
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:30,040
It's not bad that you're concerned with her.

492
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:36,560
You're her elder brother,
so you need to take care of her.

493
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:48,120
Take care of her?

494
00:34:50,230 --> 00:34:50,960
I see.

495
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:54,400
Brother, do you have a plan?

496
00:34:54,710 --> 00:34:55,480
What we can do now

497
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:57,630
is to marry Feng Wu off.

498
00:34:58,280 --> 00:34:59,440
Marry her off?

499
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:01,150
If she gets married,

500
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:03,080
she cannot take Phoenix Sword with her.

501
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:05,160
Nor can the leader of the Feng family.

502
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:06,240
At that time,

503
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:08,240
the person who can inherit the family

504
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:09,640
is only me.

505
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:11,000
Sister,

506
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:13,120
you're my only sister.

507
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:15,520
So I will act in the best interests
of you at that time.

508
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:17,040
By doing so,

509
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:18,840
we can separate Feng Wu
with His Highness Jun.

510
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:21,000
She'll no longer be a hidden threat to us.

511
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:22,560
Feng Wu.

512
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:25,000
You also come from a distinguished family,

513
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:27,120
but you don't have Phoenix Blood.

514
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:29,360
You can just

515
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:30,760
do exactly what Zuo Qingluan tells you.

516
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:31,800
Besides,

517
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:33,960
only by trying to
get close to His Highness Jun

518
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:35,600
can you make your presence felt.

519
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:37,920
And the entrance examination to Junwu Academy

520
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:39,240
is just around the corner.

521
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:42,120
Zuo Qingluan won't stay
on the border for too long.

522
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,080
I promise you that

523
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:45,920
I will do my best

524
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,440
to bring you and His Highness Jun together.

525
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:52,000
This seems to be the only way out.

526
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:53,160
Okay.

527
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,440
It allows no delay.

528
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:57,080
Now I'm gonna meet aunt

529
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:59,520
and discuss with her the marriage of Feng Wu.

530
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:04,600
It is said that

531
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:07,720
the person with Phoenix Sword
is the heir to the Feng Family.

532
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:10,440
But how did the sword
get so rusted like this?

533
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:12,080
My Lady,

534
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:12,800
why not

535
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:15,200
take a grindstone to sharpen the sword?

536
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:24,440
Why is it so heavy?

537
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:33,360
Phoenix Sword is in my hands.

538
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:34,960
But if I cannot protect myself with it,

539
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:36,360
I will surely get caught in trouble.

540
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:38,320
I cannot wait anymore.

541
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:39,720
No.

542
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,360
I must have a try.

543
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:21,200
My Phoenix Blood...

544
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:34,200
Qingyun.

545
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:38,520
Master.

546
00:37:46,740 --> 00:37:50,460
(The leader of the Celestial Palace)

547
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:54,160
Master.

548
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:55,120
I... Don't say anything.

549
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:58,280
Since you've done it,

550
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:00,440
you don't need to regret it.

551
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:02,600
If you want to achieve great success,

552
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:04,120
don't bother about trifling matters.

553
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:05,600
You seem to have been
scared out of your wits.

554
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:07,240
Don't be like that!

555
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:08,560
Master,

556
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:10,840
you have already known that Feng Wu was...

557
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:11,760
Shut up!

558
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:12,880
You should act

559
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:14,840
as if nothing has happened today,

560
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,120
you haven't done anything

561
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:19,360
and I don't know anything of it.

562
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:32,440
Keep this Ice Bracelet.

563
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:34,520
It can cover up the presence of Phoenix Blood

564
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:35,720
so that no one can find it.

565
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:43,240
Since you have got Phoenix Blood,

566
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:44,880
you should think about

567
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:46,280
how to use it to your advantage.

568
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:51,560
My Lady,

569
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:54,160
what do you think of Goddess Zuo?

570
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:56,240
She is a nice person.

571
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:57,520
I'm grateful to her.

572
00:38:57,640 --> 00:38:59,160
I don't mean this.

573
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:00,680
I mean that

574
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:02,040
many people say

575
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:04,880
His Highness Jun and her
are a match made in heaven.

576
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:07,600
Besides, it's very possible that
she would be the new Spiritual Princess.

577
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:12,480
I don't care

578
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:14,000
whether His Highness Jun and her

579
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:15,800
are a match made in heaven.

580
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:17,920
Besides, I...

581
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:27,000
Goddess Zuo.

582
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:32,760
Feng Wu.

583
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:33,960
I

584
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:35,880
come here to give you
some pills or something.

585
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:37,800
They cannot help you
regain your cultivation base,

586
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:40,120
but they can improve your health.

587
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:42,240
Thank you very much indeed.

588
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:45,720
You

589
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:47,080
are trying out the sword?

590
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:50,760
I don't have any spirit energy

591
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:52,120
in my body.

592
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:54,200
To me,

593
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:57,200
Phoenix Sword is just like
a piece of scrap iron.

594
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:02,640
Let me teach you, okay?
