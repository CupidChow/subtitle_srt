00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:40,580
(Episode 2)

3
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:47,160
Staying out of the way.

4
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,640
I think things just went very wrong.

5
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,320
Your Highness Jun, you are finally here.

6
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:03,520
Boss Jun, we are here to help you.

7
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:08,360
I will attack it from the front.

8
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,560
Feng Xun, Xuan Yi,
keep attacking it from the side.

9
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:12,640
You two, surround it from the back.

10
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,040
What is going on?

11
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:43,560
Hurry up.

12
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:00,880
My Lady!

13
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,760
I will go save the girl.
I need you to cover me.

14
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,480
My Lady!

15
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,720
My Lady!

16
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,600
What is going to happen?

17
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:20,440
Little girl.

18
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,040
Given how feeble your friend is,

19
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:24,880
she will die for sure.

20
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:26,640
My condolences.

21
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:27,920
Shut your mouth.

22
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,280
She has plenty of ideas.

23
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,560
She will come back in one piece.

24
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,240
If you speak nonsense again,

25
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,280
I will...

26
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,840
I will not go easy on you.

27
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:36,200
Uh...

28
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:37,960
Don't cry.

29
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,040
I...

30
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,720
I can't stand little girls crying.

31
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,720
What I just said was bullshit.

32
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,240
Boss Jun went after the Hawk.

33
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:46,320
I'm sure that girl will be safe.

34
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,320
Besides,

35
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,400
the Firecloud Giant Hawk is a spirit animal.

36
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:51,280
I have never heard about it harming people.

37
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,560
It must have been goaded.

38
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:54,480
Maybe

39
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,200
it will become normal soon.

40
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,280
We are not her relative or friend.

41
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,600
Stop giving her promises.

42
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:00,560
I...

43
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,280
Feng Xun, what should we do now?

44
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,640
What do you think? Go after it.

45
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,080
Senior Sister, let's go help His Highness Jun.

46
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,480
The civilians said

47
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,520
the Hundred Poison Beast
has been haunting Jingzhou recently.

48
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,920
I'd like to go there and see if I can help.

49
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:27,720
But you and His Highness Jun...

50
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:29,960
Saving a group of people

51
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:32,120
is more important than saving one person.

52
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,600
Senior Sister.

53
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,440
You are just going to Jingzhou for Zhao Ge.

54
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:38,840
I see.

55
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,120
Senior Sister, don't worry.

56
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,440
I will help His Highness Jun for you.

57
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,040
The eldest sister of the Celestial Palace
is living up to her reputation.

58
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,720
She really cares about the people.

59
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:55,160
But she follows the rules too strictly.

60
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,760
She is not a good match for Boss Jun.

61
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,080
Nonsense.

62
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:01,880
No one on Qianyuan Continent
except my Senior Sister

63
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,880
is His Highness Jun's match.

64
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,600
-Who...
-Enough.

65
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,200
Let's go to the Frozen Forest.

66
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,320
Help!

67
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:24,920
Help!

68
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:31,920
Never mind.

69
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,040
If I let you have me, I will die.
If I jump, I will die.

70
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:38,280
I might as well decide my life and death.

71
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:57,080
Sir Hawk.

72
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,000
Lord Hawk.

73
00:06:58,640 --> 00:06:59,600
Please spare me.

74
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,080
I will buy cattle and sheep

75
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,640
to feed you, okay?

76
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:10,120
Look how thin I am.

77
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,520
I don't have much meat.

78
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,000
Your teeth will get hurt in eating me.

79
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,000
Why do you want to eat me?

80
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,280
You came to save me.

81
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,840
The cliff is really high.

82
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,640
-Help!
-Hey!

83
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:58,040
Help!

84
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,720
Hey, you!

85
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,200
Help me!

86
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:18,400
What the hell?

87
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,400
Jun Linyuan!

88
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,000
Jun Linyuan!

89
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,480
This guy looks powerful,

90
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:27,320
but is actually useless in water.

91
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:42,760
Madam.

92
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:44,480
Madam.

93
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,000
What's the matter, Qiu Ling?

94
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,640
Madam, my Lady...

95
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,720
My Lady has been taken away
by a demonic beast.

96
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:15,500
(Yu Mingye, Darknight Court)

97
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:16,600
Anyone else?

98
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:21,800
Young Master,

99
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,400
my spirit energy is low

100
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:24,960
and can't compare with yours.

101
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,760
Please spare me.

102
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,400
There is no use keeping useless people around.

103
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:37,680
You are good for nothing.

104
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:38,880
Get lost!

105
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:41,440
Come on.

106
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:48,920
Young Master.

107
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:17,480
What should I do now?

108
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,280
No.

109
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,600
I can't kiss him, even though he is handsome.

110
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,440
What if he asks me
to take responsibility for him?

111
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,200
I...

112
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:42,280
Wake up.

113
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:43,600
Wake up.

114
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:45,640
This is not working.

115
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,160
It looks like I must play my trump card.

116
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:49,480
I'm sorry.

117
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:11,160
What are you doing?

118
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,240
What can I possibly do to you?

119
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:22,920
My Lord.

120
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,280
The Celestial Fruit has ripened.

121
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:26,360
The people we sent
to obtain the Celestial Fruit

122
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:28,440
have been injured
by its guard Firecloud Giant Hawk.

123
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:30,160
We have suffered great losses.

124
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,080
I need you to head there right now

125
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,920
and obtain the Celestial Fruit.

126
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:36,200
Don't let Junwu Clan beat you to it.

127
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:43,720
The Sovereign of Junwu

128
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:46,800
is bent on getting the Celestial Fruit

129
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,720
and mending the energy barrier.

130
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,680
I won't let him have his way.

131
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:56,800
If that fatuous ruler

132
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,160
continues to control Qianyuan Continent,

133
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,360
it will be a humiliation

134
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:02,080
that neither of us can take.

135
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:03,280
It's not a difficult task.

136
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,840
Jun Linyuan is the only heir

137
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:05,800
of Junwu Clan.

138
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,240
It'll be enough to eliminate him.

139
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:08,920
Penglai Pavilion and the Celestial Palace

140
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,960
support Junwu Clan for now.

141
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:12,960
If we kill Jun Linyuan,

142
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,200
the three forces will react

143
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:16,720
in a way undesirable to us.

144
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:18,520
How long must I wait?

145
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Don't be anxious.

146
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,800
They are just a mob

147
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,680
in my eyes.

148
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,280
Your current mission

149
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:28,200
is to obtain the Celestial Fruit.

150
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:29,400
Yes, My Lord.

151
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:30,600
I will start off now.

152
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,640
Why are you looking at me?

153
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:54,000
Your eyes are not ugly.

154
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,160
It's a shame these eyes

155
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:58,720
come with this face.

156
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:02,240
If you hadn't followed me
and tried to save me,

157
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,960
I wouldn't have pulled you out of water.

158
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:06,760
I heard them call you

159
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:08,480
"Your Highness Jun".

160
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:11,560
I guess you are
the Crown Prince of Junwu Clan.

161
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,160
As the dignified Crown Prince,

162
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:14,680
you can't even distinguish good from evil.

163
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:16,280
So you know I'm here

164
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:17,160
because I tried to save you.

165
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:19,200
Fine.

166
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:20,920
I won't bother with disagreeing with you.

167
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,000
Don't take this to heart.

168
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:23,200
After all, it's my obligation

169
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,120
to save weaklings such as you.

170
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,440
In that case,

171
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,560
let's not waste our breath talking.

172
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:28,960
We will part ways here.

173
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,360
Stop. Where are you going?

174
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:33,200
Mind your own business.

175
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,680
We are in the depths of the Frozen Forest.

176
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:37,840
Mortals such as you

177
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,280
can't leave the Forest on your own.

178
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:50,160
So this is the Frozen Forest.

179
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:54,680
Junwu Clan's Crown Prince chose to
inspect the border at this time

180
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:56,640
and visited Yunlai Tavern.

181
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,520
He must be here for the Celestial Fruit.

182
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:03,040
I might as well follow him.

183
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:05,920
Perhaps I can find
the Celestial Fruit this way.

184
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,640
The fire just flared up.

185
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,400
Old Man Ba.

186
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:24,920
Madam, Qiu Ling.

187
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,160
What brought you here?

188
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:27,640
We carry bad news.

189
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:30,200
A big bird took my Lady away
from Yunlai Tavern.

190
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:31,600
I haven't heard anything about her since then.

191
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,320
-A big bird?
-Madam and I

192
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:35,560
came here to seek your advice.

193
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:37,240
A big bird.

194
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:40,840
A big bird.

195
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,160
Crap.

196
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,800
Was it the Firecloud Giant Hawk?

197
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,080
That's its name.

198
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:50,360
By the way,

199
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,440
His Highness Jun
from the capital followed her.

200
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,480
I don't know if he can save my Lady.

201
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:57,840
The Firecloud Giant Hawk

202
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:01,320
is a spirit animal
that guards the Celestial Fruit.

203
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:05,000
It shouldn't harm people.

204
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,640
Qiu Ling, you said

205
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:12,590
His Highness Jun followed Feng Wu?

206
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,350
We also encountered the members

207
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:16,480
of the Celestial Palace at Yunlai Tavern.

208
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:17,800
It seems

209
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:20,590
they all came for the Celestial Fruit.

210
00:17:22,350 --> 00:17:23,720
Since the cultivators came,

211
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:26,760
Madam, you may rest easy.

212
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:31,200
Feng Wu is quick-witted and resourceful.

213
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:33,590
She will get out of danger for sure.

214
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,000
Yeah.

215
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:36,240
That's right, Madam.

216
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:37,760
My Lady and His Highness Jun

217
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,080
have known each other since childhood.

218
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:41,160
I know they have known
each other since childhood.

219
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:44,640
But their engagement
was canceled a long time ago.

220
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:48,040
Will His Highness Jun
take extra care of Feng Wu?

221
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:49,680
Wait for me.

222
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,320
You are a cultivator.

223
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:55,800
I'm a mortal. I can't compare with you.

224
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,080
You couldn't even

225
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:58,800
get rid of the big bird.

226
00:17:59,080 --> 00:17:59,800
If not for you,

227
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,760
I wouldn't have been taken here.

228
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:05,040
If you hadn't sprinted forward and hugged me,

229
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:06,720
we wouldn't have fallen off the cliff.

230
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,360
That was because...

231
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,320
This place is so cold.

232
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,040
The Frozen Forest is located
on the northernmost end.

233
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:19,720
Sunshine never reaches here.

234
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:21,600
It has an energy barrier
surrounded by cold air.

235
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,240
Cultivators can use their spirit energy
to protect themselves.

236
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,400
But you are a mortal.

237
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:25,560
-Of course you would feel cold.
-Then...

238
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,160
Then is there any way to help me?

239
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:28,520
There is no way.

240
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,280
You can only ingest
the Immortal Spirit Grass with essence...

241
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:34,240
Where can I find that sort of thing?

242
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,320
It's possible to find Immortal Grass,
but the spirit...

243
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:40,840
Has hugging me become a habit of yours?

244
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:52,680
Why is the air so fragrant?

245
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:54,400
Can it be...

246
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,720
We have broken into the territory
of the Big-Horned Blood Bees?

247
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:00,840
Come on. Crouch.

248
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,280
Don't let those Bees detect us.

249
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,480
She can't even cope with
this kind of small spirit insect.

250
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:21,960
I'm sensing the presence
of the Heaven Slaying Sword nearby.

251
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:22,680
I will look for it.

252
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,160
You just left me like that?

253
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,320
Why did they fly there?

254
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,240
I heard

255
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:47,480
that the Big-Horned Blood Bees
are low-rank spirit insects.

256
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:49,800
If I kill a few of them,

257
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,960
I might gain a small amount of spirit energy.

258
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,120
I must give it a try.

259
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,640
The Immortal Spirit Grass Royal Jelly.

260
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:40,080
I might as well drink the Royal Jelly
to nourish my essence.

261
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:42,320
Fortunately, the Big-Horned Blood Bees

262
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,160
went after that foolish boy.

263
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:47,880
I won't have another chance like this.

264
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,240
I'm taking the Royal Jelly.

265
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:07,480
Ugly girl,

266
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:08,520
here you are.

267
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:09,280
What a coincidence.

268
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,360
So many Big-Horned Blood Bees.

269
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,840
They are going to sting me badly.

270
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:18,680
It's okay. It's okay,

271
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:21,240
So you are not dead.

272
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:22,560
We spent a long time looking for you.

273
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:23,720
Have you seen Boss Jun?

274
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,120
The Frozen Forest is just huge.

275
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,480
-Don't follow me.
-We got separated.

276
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:27,600
How about we travel together?

277
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:28,800
Don't follow me.

278
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:30,360
What's your name?

279
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,640
Where is your home on the Border City?

280
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:33,640
Is it fun living there?

281
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:35,480
You should take me there when I'm free.

282
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:38,120
Chatterbox, stop following me.

283
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:40,400
Don't follow me. Don't follow me.

284
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:41,600
The Big-Horned Blood Bees.

285
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:45,360
They are pretty cute,

286
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,160
not that different from ordinary bees.

287
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:50,160
What's the matter?

288
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,000
I feel that these little things

289
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,240
are more interested in you.

290
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:56,480
Do you need me to drive them away?

291
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:57,760
Yes.

292
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:00,200
Then

293
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:01,600
go

294
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:02,600
away!

295
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:18,720
You are awesome.

296
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:19,920
I'm Feng Xun.

297
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:21,280
It was just a little trick

298
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,840
of Penglai Pavilion.

299
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:36,960
You are so kind.

300
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,440
Thank you.

301
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:43,480
What is this?

302
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:46,520
You...

303
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Your finger is bleeding.

304
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:50,480
Every time I see blood,

305
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,080
I feel dizzy.

306
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:53,040
Then...

307
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:54,360
Then how do you fight?

308
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:55,880
I'm okay with other people bleeding.

309
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:56,840
I just can't bear the sight of my own blood.

310
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:59,760
That's not blood phobia.

311
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,600
He just cherishes his life.

312
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:13,280
Alright.

313
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,200
Thank you.

314
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:29,000
No wonder they chased you all the way.

315
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:31,400
Eat this.

316
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,680
Your lips are dark-colored

317
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:35,720
and you look weak.

318
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:37,720
My blood just dripped into this thing.

319
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,320
It's a rare immortal substance

320
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:41,440
that carries a cultivator's essence.

321
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:42,720
Eat it and you won't fear the cold anymore.

322
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:44,960
Then I won't say no.

323
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:45,440
Just eat.

324
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:10,440
Thank you.

325
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:12,040
I might as well help you until the end.

326
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:13,120
Ugly girl,

327
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:14,160
I will

328
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,000
take care of from now on.

329
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:58,480
This should be able
to replenish that girl's essence.

330
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:01,080
It's to thank her
for rescuing me from the water.

331
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,040
There it is.

332
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:12,800
I fell off from there.

333
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:14,760
You fell off from there.

334
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:16,400
What about Boss Jun?

335
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:17,520
Feng Xun!

336
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:20,920
Xuan Yi, you are here.

337
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:21,800
If I didn't run into Mu Yao

338
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:23,160
and see the mark you left behind,

339
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,840
who knows when I would meet you again?

340
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:26,640
You know very well

341
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:27,680
that I can't find the way.

342
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:28,360
It's okay.

343
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:30,640
This is the girl I just saved.

344
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:32,160
Little girl,

345
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,480
you haven't told me your name yet.

346
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:38,560
My name is Feng Xiaowu.

347
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:39,880
Your surname is Feng too?

348
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:40,920
What a coincidence.

349
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:42,040
Here.

350
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:43,760
This is Xuan Yi. This is Mu Yao.

351
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:45,680
You should get to know each other.

352
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,560
We didn't come here for fun.

353
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:48,680
The irrelevant person

354
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:49,960
must leave as soon as possible.

355
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:52,840
Xuan Yi is always like that.

356
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:54,120
He has read many books.

357
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:55,600
But he doesn't know how to hang around people.

358
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:57,000
Xiaowu, don't mind him.

359
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:00,920
Our mission is important.

360
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:02,200
We must not keep her around.

361
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:03,360
What if she is a spy?

362
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:06,520
Xiaowu is a damsel in distress.

363
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:08,440
It's not like she will
snatch our Celestial Fruit.

364
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:08,960
You!

365
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:10,480
You big mouth,

366
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:11,760
you just can't keep a secret.

367
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:16,040
What are you arguing about?

368
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:17,280
Boss Jun,

369
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:18,520
you are finally here.

370
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:19,600
Listen.

371
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,560
If we leave Xiaowu here alone,

372
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:23,040
she won't be able to get out alive.

373
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:24,720
Don't you fear the cold anymore?

374
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:28,120
I've just fed her the Royal Jelly.

375
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:32,600
Boss Jun.

376
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:34,160
You are not

377
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:36,200
leaving her here alone, right?

378
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:37,760
I object to keeping her around.

379
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:38,920
We didn't come here for fun.

380
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:40,440
-Xuan...
-That's right, Your Highness Jun.

381
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:42,600
I followed you on my Senior Sister's order.

382
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:44,480
I don't want any irrelevant person
to participate in our mission.

383
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:46,560
I'm not irrelevant.

384
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,960
I just want to leave this Forest.

385
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:51,160
Aren't you cultivators?

386
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,600
I thought cultivators

387
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:54,960
help the weak and the poor

388
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:56,120
and save lives before anything else.

389
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:57,040
That's right.

390
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,840
I think her words make sense.

391
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:05,040
Since you are so supportive of her,

392
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:06,880
you will take responsibility
if anything happens.

393
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:12,760
You didn't object.

394
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:14,520
Come on.

395
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,640
Little girl, are you alright?

396
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:34,320
I'm alright. I can keep up.

397
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,360
As we travel deeper

398
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:37,560
into the Frozen Forest,

399
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:38,960
we will encounter
more ferocious demonic beasts.

400
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:41,080
Those who lack a strong cultivation base

401
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:42,120
won't be able to leave

402
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:43,160
even if they want to leave by then.

403
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:44,240
Xiaowu,

404
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:45,320
don't listen to her.

405
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:46,960
I will carry you if you can't keep up.

406
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:47,640
No need.

407
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:49,200
I can do it.

408
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:50,920
Don't worry, Feng Xun.

409
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,000
It's only been a while

410
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:54,520
and she has already won Feng Xun's heart.

411
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:56,080
I see the ugly girl

412
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:57,600
has got some good tricks.

413
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:53,000
You let the Firecloud Giant Hawk take you away

414
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:54,960
and tricked Jun Linyuan into saving you.

415
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:57,280
It gave you a reason to stay at his side.

416
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,080
You are impressive.

417
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:00,200
Spill the beans.

418
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,000
For what purpose do you follow us?

419
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:03,960
What purpose could I have?

420
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:05,840
This place is extremely dangerous.

421
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:07,360
So I follow you

422
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:08,560
wherever you go.

423
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:20,240
Your Highness Jun.

424
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:21,880
Do you know

425
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:23,800
that my Senior Sister ascended
to high-rank Spiritual Master

426
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,800
in her first year at the Celestial Palace

427
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,920
and she became
a Great Spiritual Master this year.

428
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:29,280
The leader of the Palace said

429
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:31,200
my Senior Sister Zuo Qingluan

430
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:32,200
ranks third

431
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:34,560
out of today's young cultivators.

432
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:37,840
Mu Yao,

433
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:39,680
are you talking about Zuo Qingyun?

434
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:41,360
My Senior Sister doesn't like hearing

435
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:42,920
her old name.

436
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:45,120
Now her name is Zuo Qingluan.

437
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:46,240
The Blue Phoenix

438
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,280
is the queen of birds.

439
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:49,120
Xiaowu.

440
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:50,040
Do you like fish?

441
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:50,880
We caught a lot of fish.

442
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:51,720
I like fishes the most.

443
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:52,320
Let me help you grill the fish.

444
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:52,840
Okay.

445
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:57,960
Wait.

446
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:00,320
You said Zuo Qingluan ranks third.

447
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:01,960
Then Jun Linyuan and Xuan Yi

448
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:03,880
rank first and second respectively.

449
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:05,040
Why?

450
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:07,040
The second place?

451
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:09,680
The second place belongs to
the Young Master of the Darknight Court,

452
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:10,440
Yu Mingye.

453
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:12,440
I'm fine with that.

454
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:13,560
Why?

455
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:16,400
Among the four great cultivation sects,

456
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:19,240
Junwu Clan is the most revered one.

457
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:20,360
Besides,

458
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:21,840
Boss Jun is a genius who ascended

459
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:23,440
to Great Spiritual Master
before he reached adulthood.

460
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:25,880
As for the kid of the Darknight Court,

461
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:27,720
he ascended to Great Spiritual Master
relying on myriad dirty tricks.

462
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:29,760
We can't copy his means.

463
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:52,640
Be careful, Young Master!

464
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:55,560
I almost caught it.

465
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:58,000
Master said

466
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:00,200
Zuo Qingluan is the most
talented and savvy one

467
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:02,080
of all her apprentices.

468
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:03,480
She often talked about

469
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:04,480
how lucky she was

470
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:05,960
for taking Zuo Qingluan as her apprentice,

471
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:07,040
not the other girl.

472
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:08,400
The other girl?

473
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:09,120
Who?

474
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:10,440
Who else?

475
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:11,480
Feng Wu.

476
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,200
She was a cultivation genius known as

477
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:19,360
one of the Two Phoenixes of the capital,
my Senior Sister being the other one.

478
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:20,320
Now

479
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:22,080
she is a good-for-nothing in the Border City.

480
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:24,400
Feng Wu looked stunning

481
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,680
back in the day.

482
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:29,560
She already looked beautiful as a child.

483
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:31,200
Feng Xun,

484
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:32,120
let me grill the fish for you.

485
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:33,120
I'm really good at grilling fish.

486
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:34,480
Boss Jun,

487
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:35,840
didn't you say

488
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:37,680
Feng Wu would be gorgeous when she grew up

489
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:38,760
and you would

490
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:40,400
marry her?

491
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:41,160
You said so, didn't you?

492
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:43,400
So the poker face

493
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:45,320
judged a book by its cover when he was little.

494
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:47,600
Let me find out what happened.

495
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:50,480
Who is this Feng Wu

496
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:52,200
you are talking about?

497
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,240
It's a long story.

498
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:08,120
Look.

499
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:09,840
Isn't this thing funny?

500
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:22,720
Watch out.

501
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,680
This is some sort of insect venom

502
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,680
given by the people on the south border.

503
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:29,320
Father told me not to touch this thing.

504
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:31,360
You are ungenerous.

505
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:33,240
Feng Wu,

506
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:35,360
you should visit Penglai Pavilion.

507
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:37,400
You can play with anything you want.

508
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:38,600
You are not going.

509
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:40,960
There is nothing to play with at his home.

510
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:42,680
Feng Wu,

511
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,360
marry me

512
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:45,840
when we grow up, okay?

513
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:46,880
I promise

514
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:49,120
to let you eat all the delicious foods

515
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:51,640
and let you play with all the funny things.

516
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,280
No.

517
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:55,640
Feng Wu will marry me when we grow up.

518
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:56,720
I can do everything you can do.

519
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:58,000
No, you can't.

520
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:00,760
You wouldn't even let Feng Wu
touch the insect venom.

521
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:02,000
Ungenerous.

522
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:09,920
Feng Wu.

523
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:11,840
Here.

524
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:13,880
You both want to marry me.

525
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:15,840
But I can only marry one of you.

526
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:20,200
My mother said

527
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:22,640
a woman should marry
the man who listens to her.

528
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:25,120
Very well.

529
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:26,840
Whoever eats the insect venom

530
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:28,240
will be my future husband.

531
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:38,600
Your Highness Jun,

532
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:39,720
that's the Loveless Insect Venom.

533
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:41,280
How could you eat that?

534
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:50,560
Feng Wu.

535
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:53,160
Let's go home.

536
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,880
Mother, I'm sorry.

537
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,720
Did you make trouble again?

538
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:03,440
Jun Linyuan...

539
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,960
His Highness Jun woke up and said

540
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:13,240
he ate the Loveless Insect Venom
because he wasn't careful.

541
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:16,040
He said he would leave the capital for Penglai

542
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:19,040
and see if his Venom could be removed.

543
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:21,560
Feng Xun and Xuan Yi will go with him.

544
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:23,230
Anyway,

545
00:34:23,710 --> 00:34:25,400
that boy might suffer

546
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:28,400
in terms of love.

547
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:30,600
Mother.

548
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:31,630
What?

549
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:34,150
I want to marry Jun Linyuan.

550
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:48,480
When I heard you were engaged,

551
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:50,710
I wailed for three days and nights.

552
00:34:53,190 --> 00:34:54,320
You brat,

553
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:55,230
your misfortune turned out
to be a blessing in disguise

554
00:34:55,230 --> 00:34:56,840
and you had a stunning wife.

555
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:58,710
It's a shame

556
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:00,840
that I never saw Feng Wu again

557
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:02,880
after I graduated from Penglai Pavilion.

558
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:06,760
No matter how beautiful she was,

559
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:08,760
His Highness Jun canceled their engagement.

560
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:13,000
So, Your Highness Jun,

561
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:14,080
maybe you should

562
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:16,880
consider taking another woman
as your wife.

563
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:26,240
It's a rumor.

564
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,880
The smoke is really heavy.

565
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:36,080
People say you canceled
your engagement with Feng Wu

566
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:39,120
after she lost her cultivation base
and sent back to the old house.

567
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:39,920
Boss Jun,

568
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:41,840
if you don't acknowledge
the engagement cancellation,

569
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:42,880
then Feng Wu is still

570
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:44,160
your fiancee.

571
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:49,320
Do you still love Feng Wu?

572
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:52,160
No way.

573
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:54,160
She is useless now.

574
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:56,520
You haven't canceled your engagement

575
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:57,720
because you still love Feng Wu, right?

576
00:35:58,640 --> 00:35:59,240
The truth is the opposite.

577
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:01,960
I see.

578
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:04,760
Feng Wu is obsessed with you.

579
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:06,560
You don't have the heart to hurt her.

580
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:08,320
So you force yourself to
maintain your engagement.

581
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:09,480
Who?

582
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:11,760
Obsessed?

583
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:13,760
Why don't you write plays?

584
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:14,960
Hey,

585
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:16,680
can you grill a fish or not?

586
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:17,240
I...

587
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:18,720
I'm paying attention.

588
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:19,840
I'm paying attention.

589
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:22,680
She is a good-for-nothing
without a cultivation base.

590
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:26,680
Your Highness Jun,

591
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:28,280
you are a godlike figure.

592
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:30,080
If she gets together with you,

593
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:32,440
people will spread rumors about you.

594
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:35,040
It's said

595
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,840
the Feng family pushed her too far,

596
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:39,560
causing internal damage to her body.

597
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:40,440
In the end,

598
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:42,240
she burned out her Phoenix Blood

599
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:44,320
and became a good-for-nothing
without a cultivation base.

600
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:46,280
The Feng family

601
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:48,440
finally had a cultivation genius.

602
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,000
But she lost her cultivation base.

603
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:52,000
What a pity.

604
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:56,800
The fish is ready. Come and eat.

605
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:01,800
Xiaowu is such a great cook.

606
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:02,720
Let me try it.

607
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:06,520
Yummy.

608
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:08,640
Boss Jun, come here and try it.

609
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:10,560
Go on eating. Don't mind me.

610
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,240
Xuan Yi, eat.

611
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:14,640
Xiaowu, you should also eat.

612
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,000
It's really yummy.

613
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:24,560
What's so good about that ugly girl?

614
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,600
There is no feud between me and her.

615
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:37,880
But she gossiped about me behind my back.

616
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:40,200
So what if she is a cultivator?

617
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:41,720
Just wait.

618
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:43,960
I will obtain the Celestial Fruit

619
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:46,400
and show those who look down on me

620
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:49,000
how powerful I am.

621
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:50,560
Young Master,

622
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:51,560
we more or less

623
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:53,920
got hurt in the fight.

624
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:56,040
How about we return to the Border City,

625
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:57,320
rest for a few days,

626
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:59,760
and come up with a plan

627
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:00,760
before reentering the Frozen Forest?

628
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,120
Now we know

629
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:03,440
the location of the Firecloud Cave,

630
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:04,720
we just need to obtain the Celestial Fruit

631
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:05,800
when that stupid bird

632
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:08,120
leaves the Firecloud Cave for food.

633
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:11,720
From what I have learned
about Jun Linyuan's situation,

634
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:13,480
he won't even

635
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:15,920
get to touch the Celestial Fruit.

636
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:18,080
But Young Master,

637
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:19,480
we must travel to the deepest part

638
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:20,800
of this Forest to reach the Firecloud Cave.

639
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:22,360
Numerous evil spirits reside there.

640
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:25,080
All the people we had
sent there never returned.

641
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:27,160
Our remaining people

642
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:28,360
are injured now.

643
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:30,120
Maybe we should head for the Firecloud Cave

644
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:31,480
after reinforcements arrive.

645
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:37,440
-Young... Young Master.
-First Elder,

646
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:39,640
do you think I can't

647
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:41,720
defeat a few evil spirits?

648
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:43,200
Young Master.

649
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:47,160
Spare me. Spare me.

650
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:48,400
Or do you think

651
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:51,040
I can't defeat Jun Linyuan?

652
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:52,800
Young Master, I...

653
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:57,680
Young Master.

654
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:01,800
Hear me out.

655
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:04,280
I will show the world

656
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:08,160
who is the most powerful one

657
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,040
of today's young cultivators.

658
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:12,720
Let's spend the night here

659
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:14,800
and inspect our surroundings.

660
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:16,560
Feng Xun, Xuan Yi, go there

661
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:18,040
and pick more branches.

662
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:19,400
This way,

663
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:21,480
ordinary demonic beasts
won't dare to approach us at night.

664
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:22,760
Yes.

665
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:23,920
Let's get going.

666
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:28,160
I...

667
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:51,600
Xiaowu!

668
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:53,040
Why did you push me?

669
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:53,960
