2
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:40,420
(Episode 25)

3
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:42,520
What are you waiting for?

4
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:43,960
Arrest her.

5
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:48,360
You're always negligent
in running the country.

6
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,640
Now you see it, don't you?

7
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:53,440
You've lost people's support long ago

8
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,680
and you’re veritably without any
follower to trust now.

9
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:58,280
You.

10
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,240
Take him away.

11
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,960
So you've been colluding with them.

12
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,680
Your era is over.

13
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:37,040
There is no place for you

14
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:39,800
on Qianyuan Continent.

15
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,560
The Crown Prince...

16
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:58,360
The Crown Prince won't
let your plot bear fruit.

17
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:03,320
Your Crown Prince

18
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,880
can't even

19
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,680
save himself now.

20
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:14,720
You can forget about getting his help.

21
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:18,080
Take him away.

22
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:18,880
Yes.

23
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:31,320
Ziyan, congratulations.

24
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:34,920
You finally gained control
over Qianyuan Continent.

25
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,400
Congratulations, Your Majesty.

26
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:28,880
She is so powerful.

27
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:29,880
Let's meet with Boss Jun

28
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:30,880
down the mountain.

29
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,200
But...

30
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,320
Feng Wu, don't hesitate.

31
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,720
She has turned into a demon.

32
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,440
We are no match for her.

33
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:37,840
If she leaves the mountain,

34
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,120
there will be unimaginable consequences.

35
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:40,920
Let's go.

36
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:41,720
Come on.

37
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,040
What is that sound?

38
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:01,840
It's the demon.

39
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,760
The demon is coming.

40
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,400
Go complete the explosive energy barrier.

41
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,200
But Young Master...

42
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,760
It's Lord Demon's order.

43
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:10,160
Yes. Come on.

44
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,080
Retreat.

45
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,080
Young Master.

46
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,640
The demon is getting nearer and nearer.

47
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,360
Leave now or never.

48
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:21,160
Get out of the energy barrier.

49
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:36,320
Boss Jun.

50
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,080
Feng Wu.

51
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:53,800
Run.

52
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:54,920
Hurry.

53
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,800
Why is Yu Mingye here?

54
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,520
Things have changed.

55
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:10,520
He works for the other side now.

56
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,000
Young Master.

57
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,280
Blow up the energy barrier.

58
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,720
Even if it won't kill her,
it'll hurt her badly.

59
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,600
But our people are still in there.

60
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,760
If you don't blow up
the energy barrier right now,

61
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,320
there will be more casualties.

62
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:02,480
What is this?

63
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,320
It's going to blow up. Let's go.

64
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:19,400
Feng Wu.

65
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,400
It's not her fault.

66
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,000
She shouldn't be treated like this.

67
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,320
Feng Wu!

68
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,600
Stop!

69
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,120
Young Master!

70
00:08:41,790 --> 00:08:42,720
It's too late!

71
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:44,480
Young Master.

72
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,120
Don't waste your energy.

73
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:14,920
Feng Wu!

74
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,240
The seal suppresses
most of your spirit energy.

75
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:16,600
But it allows you

76
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,200
to move freely

77
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:20,280
without constraints.

78
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:32,120
You'll have twenty years

79
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:34,080
to give birth to your child.

80
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,680
Twenty years later,

81
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,400
your tribulation will come.

82
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,200
You can choose to kill that person

83
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:43,400
and become a demon again

84
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,720
or let go of your hatred

85
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,280
and accept your fate.

86
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,080
Feng Wu!

87
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:14,920
Feng Wu!

88
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:20,600
Feng Wu!

89
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:22,680
Feng Wu!

90
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:25,920
Feng Wu!

91
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:26,960
Feng Wu!

92
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:40,880
What is the meaning of this?

93
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,640
The Holy Sovereign of Junwu Clan
has issued an order.

94
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:46,040
Jun Linyuan, Feng Xun, Xuan Yi, and Feng Wu

95
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,200
colluded in secret.

96
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:49,440
They attempted to poison
the Holy Sovereign, but failed.

97
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:52,200
Now they have colluded with a demon
to bring disaster to the capital.

98
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,240
The Holy Sovereign
has ordered me to arrest you all

99
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:56,440
and escort you to the capital
where you shall wait for punishment.

100
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,240
Are you kidding me?

101
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:01,000
Boss Jun is the Holy Sovereign's
biological son.

102
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,560
Why would he harm the Holy Sovereign?

103
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:07,240
Take Zhao Ge away for treatment.

104
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:07,800
Yes.

105
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,120
Senior Sister.

106
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:19,080
Take them away.

107
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:20,040
Yes.

108
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:21,240
Feng Xun.

109
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,200
Feng Wu is in a coma.

110
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:37,720
We must not act rashly

111
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,480
before we find out what happened.

112
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,120
Your Highness,

113
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,600
it's the Holy Sovereign's order.

114
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:49,720
Please don't make this difficult for us.

115
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:50,840
Your Highness Jun,

116
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:53,520
the collusion between you
and the demon has been proven.

117
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,320
Just then...

118
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:01,080
Fortunately, the Darknight Court helped

119
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,400
injure the demon severely.

120
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,720
There would be
unimaginable consequences otherwise.

121
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,520
Damn you

122
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,080
for bending the truth.

123
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:10,400
The Darknight Court is up to no good.

124
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,360
How can you accuse us
of colluding with the demon?

125
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,760
That's nonsense.

126
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,560
I simply did as I was ordered.

127
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,600
You may defend yourselves

128
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,080
when you see the Holy Sovereign.

129
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,640
Feng Wu must be with me.

130
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,600
No one is allowed to touch her.

131
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:33,000
What are you doing?

132
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,280
I suspect this is the proof

133
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,840
that Feng Wu colluded with the demon.

134
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,360
I'm taking it for investigation.

135
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,280
If you stop me,

136
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:44,120
you declare war on the whole Junwu Clan,

137
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:47,560
Celestial Palace and Darknight Court.

138
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:48,880
Does Penglai Pavilion

139
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,320
have the guts to do that?

140
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,240
Your Highness.

141
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:00,440
Please move.

142
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:12,040
Senior Sister.

143
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:14,360
What's going on?

144
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,600
His Highness Jun would never...

145
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:17,360
Mu Yao.

146
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:19,000
Just trust me.

147
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:22,800
Senior Sister.

148
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,320
All these years,

149
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:27,400
I've been doing as you say.

150
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,240
But you made a mistake

151
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:30,560
today.

152
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,920
The Darknight Court isn't a good sect.

153
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:35,400
Does Master know you are working with them?

154
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,800
You are going to ruin

155
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,520
the Celestial Palace's
long-standing reputation.

156
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,160
Don't bring up Master to intimidate me.

157
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:52,600
Mu Yao,

158
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,520
I'll explain things to you another day,

159
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,880
if circumstances allow.

160
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,160
Big changes are going to occur
in the capital.

161
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,680
Take our Junior Sisters back to
the Celestial Palace as soon as possible.

162
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:06,480
Don't intervene further.

163
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,040
Demon Wolf.

164
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,600
Your end is here.

165
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:37,840
You high-rank demon

166
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:40,880
still has so much strength.

167
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:00,440
I won't let you hurt the people
in the capital.

168
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:08,660
(The Capital)

169
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:12,320
By the way,

170
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:13,960
you told me

171
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:16,600
you'd be pregnant
with our children for 20 years.

172
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,520
I'm fine with a period of 20 years.

173
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:22,280
I'll take you to the temple
and burn incense every year.

174
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:23,440
It's alright.

175
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,120
No matter what people think of us,

176
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:27,120
they are our children.

177
00:17:17,070 --> 00:17:18,800
You even have the strength

178
00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:21,590
to struggle, high-rank demon.

179
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:31,120
I'll keep you as my cultivation material.

180
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,000
I'm telling you a secret.

181
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:43,000
We actually killed

182
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:45,840
all your children.

183
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,120
Their death has nothing to do with Feng Wu.

184
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,480
Goddess Zuo, this is dangerous.

185
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:55,880
You'd better not approach her.

186
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,280
Keep her here.

187
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:59,200
After putting Feng Wu to death tonight,

188
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,920
I'll take my time to torture her.

189
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:01,400
Yes.

190
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:10,640
It's fine.

191
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:14,720
They didn't die down the Baiding Mountain.

192
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:17,680
I just need them to be convicted
of colluding with the demon.

193
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:21,320
Now that Wu Youdao
has gone from Junwu Academy,

194
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:22,920
they won't have the ability

195
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,520
to cause any trouble.

196
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,240
Your plan works perfectly.

197
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:28,520
Now

198
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:31,680
all the followers of Crown Prince
have been arrested.

199
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:34,760
And we've got help from the Celestial Palace

200
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:36,280
and Darknight Court.

201
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:37,840
I'm sure Penglai Pavilion

202
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,680
dares not defy us blatantly.

203
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,960
Soon, you will be the ruler

204
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:45,480
of Qianyuan Continent.

205
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:51,680
Have proper arrangements
been made for the Holy Sovereign?

206
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,800
The Holy Sovereign is imprisoned.

207
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,320
Without your permission,

208
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:56,920
nobody must approach him.

209
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:59,520
I have spread the word

210
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:02,720
that the Holy Sovereign
has started cultivating

211
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,040
behind closed doors again.

212
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:05,640
The Holy Sovereign
has cultivated behind closed doors

213
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,520
multiple times over the years.

214
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:09,280
Nobody will suspect anything.

215
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,200
Good.

216
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:13,080
But

217
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:16,520
I don't know how to punish
Feng Wu and the others.

218
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,280
After all, Jun Linyuan
is still the Crown Prince.

219
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,360
If we punish him rashly,

220
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:23,840
the people will feel dissatisfied.

221
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:26,160
Please give a clear instruction.

222
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:31,080
Escort Feng Wu to the Sky-reaching Terrace.

223
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,680
Interrogate her

224
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:34,800
and punish her with the Bone-eroding Thunder.

225
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:37,480
Imprison the others for now.

226
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:39,400
By the way,

227
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,600
where is the Demon Wolf?

228
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:44,280
The Demon Wolf is a high-rank demon.

229
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:46,040
Although she is severely wounded,

230
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:47,920
we can't eliminate her

231
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:50,040
for the moment.

232
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:52,400
She is suppressed by Zuo Qingluan's spell

233
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,640
in the suburb of the capital

234
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:57,040
and guarded by Junwu Clan's guards.

235
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,000
Dealing with the Demon Wolf
is no need to rush.

236
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:02,720
We can leave her as
Zuo Qingluan's cultivation material.

237
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:06,040
Feng Wu is our priority.

238
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:07,760
To prevent trouble,

239
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:10,960
she must die tonight.

240
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,200
Miss Zhao Ge.

241
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:14,040
Goddess Zuo ordered

242
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:15,440
that you must not leave.

243
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:16,320
Miss Zhao Ge.

244
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:17,680
Miss Zhao Ge.

245
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:19,320
Zhao Ge.

246
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:30,320
You are dismissed.

247
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:31,440
Yes.

248
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,200
Zhao Ge.

249
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:52,960
Even you don't trust me?

250
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:54,560
Senior Sister.

251
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:56,800
Ever since you asked me

252
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,600
to lure Wu to Baiding Mountain,

253
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:00,760
I've deemed you unworthy of my trust.

254
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:04,760
Why don't you explain?

255
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:06,640
We have spent so many years together.

256
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,400
I don't believe you are such a person.

257
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:10,640
Did you turn into like this

258
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:11,840
because you are jealous of Feng Wu?

259
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:16,240
Zhao Ge,

260
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:18,880
listen to me and go back.

261
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:26,080
After I handle the affairs,

262
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,800
I'll take you back to the Celestial Palace.

263
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:31,280
Your spirit energy has increased a lot.

264
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,280
Master has changed her opinion of you.

265
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:34,640
I'll continue to protect you

266
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:36,560
after we return.

267
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,800
Nobody will talk

268
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,520
behind your back anymore.

269
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:42,200
Wu is innocent.

270
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,360
I'm in this with them.

271
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,040
Zhao Ge,

272
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,080
don't you want to go home with me?

273
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:50,120
No.

274
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:52,720
When I was banished from
the Celestial Palace to the capital,

275
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:55,680
Wu cared for me.

276
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:57,680
When I was bullied,

277
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:00,680
Mr. Xuan Yi helped me.

278
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,800
I lost my home a long time ago.

279
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:06,680
They are my families and friends.

280
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:09,600
I won't give them up.

281
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:11,720
Senior Sister.

282
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,400
Don't make any more mistakes.

283
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:16,080
Zhao Ge,

284
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:18,840
people sure change.

285
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:22,480
Nothing is more important than life.

286
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:24,800
Some things change.

287
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:28,800
But some things never change.

288
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,040
A genuine person will always be genuine.

289
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:32,440
Senior Sister.

290
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,720
If you refuse to come to your senses,

291
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:37,480
stand against Feng Wu,

292
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:39,240
and continue to hurt them,

293
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:40,400
then we won't

294
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,880
be friends anymore.

295
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,600
Do you mean

296
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,760
you'll cut ties with me

297
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:52,560
for those outsiders?

298
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:54,840
Yes.

299
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:17,480
Fine.

300
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,560
You can suffer with them

301
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:23,720
if that's what you want.

302
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:30,560
Take her to the Celestial Prison.

303
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:31,720
Yes.

304
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:32,360
Senior Sister.

305
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:33,520
Do you want some?

306
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:49,560
Senior Sister.

307
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:52,280
Don't offend the leader

308
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:54,320
for me.

309
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:56,680
Zhao Ge,

310
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:58,560
I'm sorry.

311
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:00,840
I wasn't able to persuade Master

312
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:02,160
to keep you in the Celestial Palace.

313
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:04,040
You'll leave for the capital

314
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:07,040
in a month.

315
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:08,680
It's okay, Senior Sister.

316
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:11,280
I'll be alright in the capital.

317
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:12,960
I have good friends there.

318
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:14,400
I'll introduce them to you
when the time comes.

319
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,040
What do you say?

320
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:16,320
Really?

321
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:19,080
You

322
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:22,520
are a loner.

323
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:26,880
You should make more friends after I'm gone.

324
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:28,760
I don't need friends.

325
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:34,640
I...

326
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:38,400
Don't worry, Senior Sister.

327
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,200
No matter where I am,

328
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:42,360
I'll always think of you.

329
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:46,120
And

330
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,160
every time I heard your name

331
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:49,240
from an outsider, I felt so proud

332
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:50,120
of having

333
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,680
such a talented

334
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:52,680
Senior Sister.

335
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:01,680
Feng Wu.

336
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:05,960
I will make you pay for it.

337
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,480
Guards!

338
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:12,920
Open the door!

339
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:13,920
Let us out!

340
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:15,720
Guards!

341
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:18,240
Open the door! Let us out!

342
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:19,840
Anyone there?

343
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:21,400
Open the door!

344
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:28,240
Don't waste your strength.

345
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:30,360
We can't use

346
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,560
our spirit energy in Celestial Prison.

347
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:34,720
But we can't just await our doom.

348
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:36,640
Boss Jun,

349
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:38,880
say something.

350
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,280
Feng Wu was taken away.

351
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:46,800
I wonder if she is safe now.

352
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:55,920
We shouldn't have

353
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,920
let them capture us.

354
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,200
Save your breath.

355
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:00,920
Didn't you hear what Zuo Qingluan said?

356
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,840
They were working with the Darknight Court.

357
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:05,040
If the Darknight Lord Demon joined the fight,

358
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:06,800
we'd lose to him.

359
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:13,560
We should live to fight another day.

360
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:54,240
Watch closely.

361
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:58,040
This is how it ends for a rebel.

362
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:18,800
Your Highness Jun,

363
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,680
the Holy Queen wants you out for a talk.

364
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,480
Why invite Boss Jun?

365
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:26,320
The Holy Queen probably

366
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:28,200
is behind all this.

367
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:30,800
Please move.

368
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:36,760
Boss Jun.

369
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:01,840
Linyuan, you are here.

370
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:06,120
I need to talk to him.

371
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:07,680
You are dismissed.

372
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:09,200
Yes.

373
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:15,080
Linyuan, come and sit.

374
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:20,920
I made all these dishes myself.

375
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:22,080
Try them

376
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:23,680
and see if they are to your taste.

377
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:28,840
Since I started to
remember things as a child,

378
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:31,880
you have been cooking for me.

379
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,120
But I seem to forget

380
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:36,240
when I stopped

381
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:39,600
enjoying your dishes.

382
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:43,000
You may not be my biological son,

383
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:46,040
but I have taken care of you for many years.

384
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:50,960
We share a family bond.

385
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:52,880
That's why I hesitated

386
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:55,840
and didn't reveal

387
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,720
your true colors in public.

388
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:03,200
Where is the Holy Sovereign locked up?

389
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:07,200
Don't worry.

390
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:09,640
He isn't in danger.

391
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:11,640
Did you marry him

392
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,520
for the power

393
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:16,040
you've gained today?

394
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,280
I'm your captive now.

395
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:22,920
There's no need to hide anything.

396
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:25,200
Just tell me.

397
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:29,640
You think I did all this

398
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,160
for nothing but power?

399
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,600
The Holy Sovereign,

400
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,760
namely your father.

401
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:42,440
You saw what he did.

402
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:45,240
He was designated by Mu Jiuzhou

403
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:48,000
as the ruler of the whole Qianyuan Continent.

404
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,720
But what has he done?

405
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:52,040
Yes.

406
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,200
He indulged in cultivation

407
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:56,240
and paid no attention to world affairs.

408
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:57,760
But

409
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:59,200
under his rule,

410
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:01,560
the land was prosperous
and the people lived in peace and wealth.

411
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:03,400
Isn't that enough?

412
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:04,720
That's because he was lucky

413
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:06,200
to rule in a peaceful time.

414
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,160
If he ruled like that
in a time of turbulence,

415
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:12,160
Qianyuan Continent
would plunge into an abyss.

416
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:14,000
Peaceful times and harsh times

417
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:15,800
shouldn't be compared.

418
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:17,640
I know how he ruled.

419
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:19,560
But if disaster or rebellion occurred,

420
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:21,040
he wouldn't ignore it.

421
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,520
What exactly are you going to do?

422
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,360
Do you know

423
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:31,600
why Mu Jiuzhou

424
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:34,320
met his doom

425
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:36,400
during his ascension?

426
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:40,360
He deviated from
the right track of cultivation.

427
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,800
Yes, he deviated.

428
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,920
But

429
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:47,760
I was the cause.

430
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,640
I was of your age back then.

431
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:57,160
Who wouldn't love heroes?

432
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,560
Like numerous damsels,

433
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:01,600
I fell in love with him.

434
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:04,080
I developed a crush on him.

435
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,640
But he

436
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,040
rejected me

437
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:10,320
because of a dead woman.

438
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:12,680
He said he wanted to ascend to immortality

439
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:15,800
and protect Qianyuan Continent.

440
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:21,720
Ziyan,

441
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:23,840
I know how you feel.

442
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:27,360
But I had lost the ability
to love a long time ago.

443
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:32,920
In what way am I
inferior to my Senior Sister?

444
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:39,920
Qingtan is a nice man.

445
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:42,320
Don't miss the opportunity to be with him.

446
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:46,880
He'll become the ruler of Junwu Clan

447
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:49,400
and even Qianyuan Continent.

448
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:51,360
If you stay with him,

449
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:53,840
you'll realize your dream.

450
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:58,160
But I only want you.

451
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:01,960
I only wish to ascend successfully.

452
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:04,280
There is nothing else can distract me.

453
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:18,040
You need to give up.

454
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:24,040
So,

455
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,400
I hate cultivation.

456
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:29,920
I hate it for taking away my love.

457
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:33,240
I hate Mu Jiuzhou for going his own way

458
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:35,240
and leaving me.

459
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:37,840
So, you destroyed him

460
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:39,920
because you loved him.

461
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:41,280
Yes.

462
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,640
I couldn't have him,

463
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:45,280
so I destroyed him.

464
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:48,360
I'll also destroy the Continent
he wanted to protect.

465
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,680
What kind of world do you want?

466
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:52,840
A world without cultivators?

467
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:54,720
No.

468
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:57,440
A world where

469
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:59,480
all cultivators serve you.

470
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:02,520
All that said,

471
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:05,560
you just did this to gain power.

472
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:09,000
You have no right to talk about love.

473
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:13,080
Whatever.

474
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:15,920
The reason

475
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:18,360
no longer matters.

476
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,120
Linyuan,

477
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:27,600
Qianyuan Continent needs people

478
00:34:28,630 --> 00:34:31,280
like you to govern

479
00:34:32,230 --> 00:34:33,670
and bring new hope

480
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:36,040
to the people.

481
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:39,600
You jest.

482
00:34:40,150 --> 00:34:42,150
You just want me as a puppet.

483
00:34:42,710 --> 00:34:44,080
You're afraid that you won't succeed

484
00:34:44,670 --> 00:34:47,280
to the throne legally after you eliminate me.

485
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:48,710
Am I right?

486
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:52,880
You really think of me this way?

487
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:54,280
You imprisoned the Holy Sovereign

488
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:55,440
and colluded with the Darknight Court.

489
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:56,920
What I think doesn't matter.

490
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:58,000
What matters

491
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,560
is the people's opinion.

492
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:19,680
You don't fear death?

493
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,240
Jun Linyuan, what are you doing?

494
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:25,200
Put down your sword!

495
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:29,160
Aunt.

496
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:30,760
That was so dangerous.

497
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:32,400
Convey my order.

498
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:36,520
Jun Linyuan colluded with a demon
and attempted to murder his mother.

499
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:38,800
He is the enemy of all cultivators.

500
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:40,520
Disciples of Junwu Academy, Penglai Pavilion,

501
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:42,640
Celestial Palace and Darknight Court

502
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:43,960
must fight him together

503
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,920
to kill him.

504
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:48,480
Yes.

505
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:15,040
You couldn't even detain an animal.

506
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:16,960
What's the use of keeping you?

507
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:22,040
She tore her claw from her body.

508
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:26,840
Go find her!

509
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:28,240
Yes.

510
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:52,440
What,

511
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:56,600
you would even disobey my order?

512
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:04,720
Father.

513
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:10,440
Feng Wu is the only woman I love.

514
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:12,920
Please spare Feng Wu

515
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:15,280
for my sake.

516
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:18,000
After all these years,

517
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:24,760
you finally called me father again.

518
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:31,760
You stopped calling me father

519
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:36,360
because I told you to kill.

520
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:39,240
Now you called me father

521
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:42,280
to save a person.

522
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:53,080
It's too late.

523
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,200
The five types of lightning
have come together.

524
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:01,640
The Bone-eroding Thunder
will torture her to death.

525
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:28,160
What is happening outside?

526
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:33,120
Huang Li?

527
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:34,760
Why are you here?

528
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:36,920
Zuo Qingluan has been
colluding with Holy Queen Gao

529
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:38,680
and going around working for her.

530
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:41,240
I heard Feng Wu would be executed
at the Sky-reaching Terrace tonight.

531
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:43,400
Senior Sister...

532
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:45,240
How did Senior Sister turn into like this?

533
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:46,560
Someone broke into the prison
to rescue the criminals!

534
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:48,240
Go.

535
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:49,280
What about you?

536
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:50,920
Don't mind me.
The priority is to save Feng Wu.

537
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:52,080
But...

538
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:52,720
Zhao Ge,

539
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:55,640
I'm sorry that I didn't stop

540
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:58,320
Mu Yao from bullying you.

541
00:38:58,600 --> 00:38:59,840
I treated you unfairly.

542
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:01,280
Give me a chance

543
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:02,360
to make it up to you.

544
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:05,080
It's all in the past.

545
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:07,240
I'm over it. It's not your fault.

546
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:08,840
Guards! Someone broke into the prison!

547
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:10,080
-Go.
-Someone broke into the prison!

548
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,120
No more talking. Let's go.

549
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:25,600
The five types of lightning
have come together.

550
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:27,840
You can't do anything over there.

551
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:29,040
Father,

552
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:31,960
this will be the last time I call you father.

553
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:34,320
I can't watch the girl I love

554
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:35,440
die like this.

555
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:36,960
I'll save her

556
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:39,720
even if it means going against you

557
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:42,640
and the whole Darknight Court.
