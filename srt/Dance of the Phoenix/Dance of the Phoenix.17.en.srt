2
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:40,580
(Episode 17)

3
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,520
It is unexpected that

4
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:50,720
the female disciples of Junwu Academy

5
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:51,920
haven't seen much of the world.

6
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:52,760
Seeing the three of us,

7
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,120
they can't turn their eyes away.

8
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,240
We are here for learning and cultivation.

9
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:58,080
If you keep idling about all day long,

10
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,640
believe it or not,
I will inform Master Feng of it

11
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,920
and ask him to teach you a good lesson.

12
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:02,880
It is improper for you to be unserious
when you should be serious,

13
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,040
and to be serious
when you should be unserious.

14
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,040
When can you get rid of this flaw?

15
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:05,880
Today is the first day of school.

16
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,160
I don't want to quarrel with you.

17
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,640
Enough. Stop talking.

18
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,120
Boss Jun, what is going on over there?

19
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,440
Let's go check it out.

20
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,880
Back then, you promised me that

21
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,480
if I get admitted to Junwu Academy,

22
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,960
you will call me by that name.

23
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,280
You won't break your promise, will you?

24
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,040
I dare not break my promise.

25
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,600
I just...

26
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:34,400
Mu Yao.

27
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:37,680
Senior Sister.

28
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:39,820
(Righteous Teaching Hall)

29
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:40,560
Feng Wu,

30
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,200
just forget this, will you?

31
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,720
They are just joking words.

32
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,000
You need not take them seriously.

33
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,520
Back then, you helped me in the Border City.

34
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,560
Since you requested me to do so,

35
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:51,080
I should not refuse to do it.

36
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,160
But,

37
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:53,400
I am sorry I have to let you down.

38
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,320
Today I won't change my mind
no matter who intercedes for you.

39
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,480
People must be responsible for what they did.

40
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,120
You!

41
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:00,440
At the time of the trial,
Mu Yao plotted against me intentionally.

42
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,120
You all saw that,

43
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,240
didn't you?

44
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:04,400
Feng Wu.

45
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,520
Mu Yao really did something wrong.

46
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,800
I apologize to you on behalf of her.

47
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:10,120
Now we are attending the same school.

48
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,960
Why can't you give her a break?

49
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:16,440
Your Highness Jun,

50
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,040
Junwu Academy always advocates
clemency and benevolence.

51
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,400
Do you think this matter
must be handled this way?

52
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,520
I was not involved in this matter.

53
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:28,600
So I can't make comments irresponsibly.

54
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:31,000
But if they have reached an agreement,
they should honor it.

55
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,320
If Feng Wu is the loser today,

56
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,040
I guess you won't go easy on her, will you?

57
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:37,520
Senior Sister.

58
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,040
Of course they won't.

59
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,320
Zuo Qingluan,

60
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,880
I thought you were a nice person in the past.

61
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,040
It is unexpected
that you are an expert of muddling through.

62
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,000
With only a few words,
you described Mu Yao as the victim

63
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,480
who had been wrongly treated.

64
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,360
Aren't you tired living
in disguise every day?

65
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,000
How dare you?

66
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,920
What did you mean,
this man of Darknight Court?

67
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,720
Are you qualified to speak here?

68
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,000
I meant that

69
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,280
since you lost to her,

70
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,640
you should do as you promised quickly.

71
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,440
Otherwise, you will bring disgrace
upon your Celestial Palace.

72
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,960
Senior Sister, you heard what he said.

73
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,200
Since you lost to her,

74
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,960
I can't exculpate you.

75
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:12,560
What you should do

76
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:13,960
is for you to decide.

77
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,400
Senior Sister, why did you also...

78
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:18,880
Anyway, nobody here

79
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,320
understands the dialect of the Border City.

80
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:22,360
It doesn't matter
if you call her by that name.

81
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,200
Baba (Dad).

82
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:43,440
Your voice was too low.

83
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,120
Say it loudly.

84
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:53,560
Baba (Dad).

85
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:58,960
Good kid!

86
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:02,640
Well,

87
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:03,960
now leave, everybody.

88
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:04,800
Let's go.

89
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,560
Feng Wu, I won't forget today's humiliation.

90
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,080
How could you talk
to your Baba (dad) in this way?

91
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,080
How are you feeling?

92
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,680
Are you happy now?

93
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,240
Kind of.

94
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,040
Well, what does this word "Baba" mean?

95
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,760
Why do you have so many questions?

96
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,280
It is enough as long as I can understand it.

97
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:25,080
I am feeling so good.

98
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:31,560
Well done!

99
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:32,720
I have known you for a long time.

100
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,360
This is the first time
that I have heard your decent words.

101
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:35,720
I am off.

102
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:44,900
(Righteous Teaching Hall)

103
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,200
Greetings to you, Master Zhao.

104
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,920
Hello, everybody!

105
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,320
Please be seated.

106
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,640
Boys and girls,

107
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,880
you come from different places
of Qianyuan Continent.

108
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:20,200
Today we are lucky to gather here.

109
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,200
I feel honored that

110
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,240
you can attend my lecture.

111
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,800
Though your ranks
of cultivation are different.

112
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:29,520
Some of you are already
Great Spiritual Masters.

113
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:33,560
Some of you are only
junior-rank spiritual practitioners.

114
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:34,400
But

115
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:36,280
in my class,

116
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,600
I extend the same treatment to all.

117
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,680
You can speak your mind freely.

118
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:45,440
Wise people value the basis.
A solid basis gives rise to the Great Way.

119
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,360
Today,

120
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:50,480
I will start my lecture
with the origin of Qianyuan Continent.

121
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,800
Xuan Yi. Xuan Yi.

122
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,000
Where has Yu Mingye gone?

123
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,760
Actually, he is

124
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:11,840
a specially-recruited student
from Darknight Court.

125
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,520
Dean Ning has said that

126
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,480
the academy shows respect
to various sects' differences in progress.

127
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:18,240
Thus, he can decide
when to attend lectures by himself.

128
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:50,400
Ma...

129
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,760
You rattled me.

130
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:54,160
I thought it was our master.

131
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:55,320
Our master

132
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,480
have watched you sleep for two hours.

133
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,160
But you didn't wake up.

134
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,240
Later, he couldn't hold on
and went for a meal.

135
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:03,920
Is what you said true?

136
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:07,480
No. I lied.

137
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:08,480
Come with me.

138
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:14,600
I just nodded off

139
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:16,440
in class.

140
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,320
You need not bring me here

141
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,600
to force me to make up missed lessons.

142
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,120
It is the Water Sky Vase.

143
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,560
Will you really give it to me?

144
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,670
Why do you want it on earth?

145
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,840
Of course I have my reasons.

146
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,670
It is not that I don't want to tell you.

147
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:47,670
But.

148
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:49,760
Suit yourself.

149
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,440
But I must make it clear to you that

150
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,360
in the next class,

151
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:56,280
you mustn't nod off again.

152
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,920
Junwu Academy has made strict rules.

153
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,920
If you are expelled due to misconduct,

154
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,000
I won't be able to intercede for you.

155
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:05,760
I got it.

156
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,720
Where are you going?
We will have lessons in the afternoon.

157
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,520
I will go put away the vase.

158
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,840
It is a precious treasure.

159
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,760
If it is broken, I will feel very sorry.

160
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:16,960
Don't worry.

161
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,440
I will be back before the midday class.

162
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,040
Silly bird! Silly bird!

163
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:28,760
Little Parrot.

164
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,120
Colored Phoenix.

165
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:32,880
Let me in quickly.

166
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,080
Now I have

167
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:36,000
the first Star Shard in my hands.

168
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,520
Colored Phoenix, look!

169
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,000
Are you crazy, Colored Phoenix?

170
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,360
I made great efforts to find it.

171
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,040
Why are you so startled?

172
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:02,360
Look!

173
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:15,840
This is the real look of the Star Shard.

174
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:24,860
(Junwu Academy)

175
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:26,360
Look at it quickly!

176
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:28,000
What is written on it?

177
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:30,120
Junwu Academy.

178
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,160
What does this mean?

179
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,440
It means that the next Star Shard

180
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:37,000
is hidden in Junwu Academy.

181
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,340
(Junwu Academy)

182
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,320
Ascetic cultivation

183
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,840
means you must eat simple food,

184
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:51,280
wear plain clothes and purify your heart.

185
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,080
You eat so much fish and meat every day.

186
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,480
It is not proper.

187
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,040
In Junwu Academy,

188
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,760
there are 134 rules.

189
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,640
Is there any rule stipulating
what can be eaten and what can not

190
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,000
as well as how much food can be eaten a day?

191
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:08,680
It is a pity that these dishes are not
as good as those cooked by Feng Wu.

192
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,600
Zhao Ge, come to sit down.

193
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:23,720
Yi.

194
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,680
I have brought you the steamed buns
with vegetable filling.

195
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,960
Do you mind

196
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:28,960
tasting them?

197
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,040
After all, we will have
to attend classes in the afternoon.

198
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,160
Yi.

199
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,880
Good for you, Xuan Yi.

200
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,280
I have been worried about you in vain.

201
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,800
You have got your own plans.

202
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,480
Nonsense!

203
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,560
Don't refuse her kindness.

204
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:44,960
Eat them as she wishes.

205
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:57,720
That is the spirit.

206
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:59,000
I will eat the remaining one.

207
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,160
You brought these.

208
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,120
Did Feng Wu make them?

209
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:08,000
How could it be made by Feng Wu?

210
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:09,840
It is too salty.

211
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:14,760
I made it.

212
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:16,040
Sorry, Yi.

213
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,000
I made it.

214
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,520
Yi, stop eating it.

215
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,200
Zhao...

216
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:24,080
It is too salty.

217
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:33,720
What is wrong?

218
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:34,880
I am afraid that you are not clear-minded.

219
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,040
So I want you to be sober-minded.

220
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:50,760
Zhao Ge.

221
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:06,720
This is the steamed stuffed bun.

222
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:08,440
Don't eat it.

223
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,320
They,

224
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,080
they are made for Yi.

225
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,800
It tastes too salty.

226
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:22,840
Don't be sad.

227
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,800
Anyway, this is not what you are good at.

228
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:26,680
No. I didn't mean that.

229
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,440
Zhao Ge,

230
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:30,520
you made them by yourself.

231
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:31,800
How could it be possible that Xuan Yi

232
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,080
didn't feel your kindness?

233
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,640
Yi is actually a nice guy.

234
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:38,800
But he is not good
at expressing his feelings.

235
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:40,520
Why did you defend him?

236
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:42,400
You are belittling yourself.

237
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:44,320
Is what I said wrong?

238
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,000
Think about His Highness Jun.

239
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,920
Superficially, he seems
to be indifferent to you.

240
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:49,120
But, as a matter of fact,

241
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:50,440
he treats you very nicely.

242
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,440
Why is he here?

243
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,960
It is very possible
that he guesses you are hungry,

244
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,680
so he is here to bring some food to you.

245
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,760
I won't stay here disturbing you.

246
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,240
Osmanthus cake.

247
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,880
Why do you know I like this kind of food?

248
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,200
Would you like some?

249
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,080
It is yummy.

250
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:25,160
Don't move.

251
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,480
What did you and Zhao Ge talk about just now?

252
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:38,640
We talked about Xuan Yi.

253
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:41,040
He is insensitive to love

254
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,080
and isn't aware of a girl's feelings
for him at all.

255
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:46,040
Alas, this is men's doing.

256
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,320
So,

257
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,080
we'd better speak our mind

258
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:00,800
and make others understand us, right?

259
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:04,760
I have made a decision.

260
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:06,560
What decision?

261
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:09,280
I will conduct cultivation diligently
in Junwu Academy

262
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,000
and work hard to improve my cultivation base.

263
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:11,680
In this way,

264
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,720
I can fight with you shoulder to shoulder.

265
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:19,560
I believe you can do it.

266
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:39,020
(Library Pavilion)

267
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:49,080
Being so incapable, how could Feng Wu say

268
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:50,520
she would fight
with His Highness Jun side by side?

269
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:52,600
She really overrated her ability.

270
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,920
I don't know what tricks she has played

271
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:00,000
to enchant His Highness Jun
and make him obey her in everything.

272
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,480
Senior Sister.

273
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:07,200
You can't allow her to get her way.

274
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,800
You are a good match for His Highness Jun.

275
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:10,880
Without the Phoenix Blood, Feng Wu

276
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,200
will only be a worthless person.

277
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:14,070
She will have nothing to do
with His Highness Jun.

278
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:17,560
Mu Yao, you need to keep a low profile

279
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:18,960
so that others won't have something on you.

280
00:17:19,070 --> 00:17:21,560
I just feel that it is unfair to you.

281
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:22,960
Since we are in the academy,

282
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,920
improving our cultivation base
is the most important thing.

283
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,070
Stop doing meaningless things.

284
00:17:27,110 --> 00:17:27,800
But...

285
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,800
You even want to disobey me?

286
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,830
I got it.

287
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,920
Let's go back.

288
00:17:57,940 --> 00:18:02,140
(Auspicious Clouds)

289
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:06,360
The midday class begins now.

290
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:16,440
I found something unusual
by observing the star images.

291
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,000
I suspect that someone

292
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:21,200
is planning secretly to awake
the nascent soul of Mu Jiuzhou.

293
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:24,360
If this person appears again,

294
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,360
our Darknight Court's plan
of unifying Qianyuan Continent

295
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,960
will be hampered for sure.

296
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:31,520
If so, we should hurry to stop it.

297
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:32,960
Do you have any other clues?

298
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:38,320
Mu Jiuzhou has been missing for many years.

299
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:42,400
Nobody knows whether he has perished
spiritually and physically.

300
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:44,200
Only based on the star images,

301
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:46,120
we really can't confirm the fact.

302
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:49,480
Now the only clue is Wu Youdao.

303
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:52,480
In terms of cultivation base
and cultivation method,

304
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,840
he is very similar to Mu Jiuzhou.

305
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,680
He comes from a poor family.

306
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:58,880
He isn't affiliated to any sect.

307
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:02,080
But he has become
the top cultivator in this world.

308
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,440
This is really doubtful.

309
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:09,480
A new school year
of Junwu Academy has started.

310
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:11,640
You should stay in it to make investigations

311
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,920
to see whether there are other clues.

312
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:14,960
Yes.

313
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:15,960
Moreover,

314
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,200
the Water Sky Vase.

315
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,400
About the Water Sky Vase,

316
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,920
since it has fallen
into the hands of Jun Linyuan,

317
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:28,160
let's just forget it.

318
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:31,480
I guess he just wants to use it

319
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:33,600
to cotton up to Wu Youdao.

320
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,720
I just don't know

321
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,680
whether he has anything to do with

322
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,160
Mu Jiuzhou's awakening from the slumber.

323
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:44,760
I promise I will continue looking for clues

324
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:46,080
to stop Mu Jiuzhou from waking up.

325
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:57,080
Channel the vital energy
into the elixir field.

326
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,280
On Qianyuan Continent,

327
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:02,880
all sects have their own attributes.

328
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:04,400
For example,

329
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,360
Junwu Clan's attribute is metal
while Celestial Palace's is water.

330
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:13,440
Though cultivators
can choose their attributes,

331
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:14,440
in most cases,

332
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:17,480
they choose to conduct cultivation based
on the attributes of their sects.

333
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:20,240
As long as learning to channel
the vital energy skillfully,

334
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:22,000
cultivators can combine
and utilize the elements around them

335
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:25,520
according to their attributes.

336
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,000
Where is my ferule?

337
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:53,160
Did any of you see my ferule?

338
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:05,680
Master.

339
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:15,120
Master. This...

340
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:20,200
It is you again.

341
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:21,920
Why did you take my ferule?

342
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:23,040
I didn't.

343
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,000
If you didn't take it,

344
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,640
why are you holding it now?

345
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:27,440
You not only refused to repent,

346
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,640
but also lied.

347
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,720
I don't know why it is on my desk.

348
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:31,200
I...

349
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:33,480
I think you just got lucky

350
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:34,480
to be admitted to Junwu Academy.

351
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:36,280
Since you are a student here now,
you should work hard in class.

352
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:37,160
But you just disturbed
the class purposefully.

353
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,280
What thoughts are you harboring?

354
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:40,480
You!

355
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:42,120
In class,

356
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,240
don't be noisy.

357
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,400
In the morning, I saw that you were indolent

358
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:48,760
and slept in class.

359
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:51,240
Among the disciples of every year,

360
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:52,840
there are some naughty ones.

361
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:55,360
It doesn't come as a surprise to me.

362
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:58,920
If I don't teach you a lesson today,

363
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:01,840
when you come across high-rank
demonic beasts outside some other day,

364
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,640
how can you stay alive?

365
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:07,960
Please clam you anger, Master.

366
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:10,680
Don't fuss about such a female disciple.

367
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,360
My feet!

368
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:32,880
You,

369
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,520
go out to accept punishment.

370
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:57,000
Feng Wu,

371
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:00,360
before you melt the ice

372
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,720
and make the kettle of tea water boil,

373
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,840
you can't enter the classroom
to listen to my lecture.

374
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:24,300
(Library Pavilion)

375
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:42,240
Junwu Academy was actually
built by Mu Jiuzhou.

376
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:46,960
Library Pavilion is the quietest place
of Junwu Academy.

377
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,680
People rarely come here.

378
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:50,880
Is he...

379
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,920
Are you a wild cat from somewhere?

380
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:15,440
Do you want to read the sacred writings here

381
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,400
to acquire the Great Way
and become an immortal someday?

382
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:19,640
However,

383
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:21,960
not everybody is qualified to

384
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:23,960
read the sacred writings here.

385
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,240
If you intend to break into Library Pavilion,

386
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:28,400
you will court disasters.

387
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:30,240
This place is definitely fishy.

388
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:59,680
The goddess of Celestial Palace
has no right to interfere in my affairs.

389
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:02,000
No matter what you're planning to do,

390
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:03,640
it is none of my business.

391
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:07,560
I only want to know your purpose
of staying in Junwu Academy.

392
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:08,680
My purpose?

393
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:11,240
I am attending Junwu Academy for studies.

394
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:14,600
Do you think I am here
to play up to people of power?

395
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:15,600
What do you mean?

396
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:16,640
Nothing.

397
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:18,440
I don't care about your scheme.

398
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:21,400
You'd better not meddle in my business.

399
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:24,160
Because you can't even if you want to.

400
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:28,160
All kinds of people are jumbling together
in Junwu Academy.

401
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:31,080
The important figures of all sects
are stationed here.

402
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:34,320
The people of your Darknight Court
can't do whatever you want.

403
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:36,440
Even if I can't stop you,

404
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:38,160
there is someone who can.

405
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:41,560
For example,

406
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:45,240
Jun Linyuan.

407
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:46,120
How could you!

408
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,160
You also think I am inferior to Jun Linyuan.

409
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:52,880
All of you are not good at judging people.

410
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,800
I don't think you are inferior to anyone.

411
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:57,680
After all, the spirit energy
is always changeable.

412
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,200
I can't come to a final conclusion about it.

413
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:01,920
You are outstanding in spirit energy,
but weird in behavior.

414
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:04,800
You came to Junwu Academy
not only for studies.

415
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:06,800
As the eldest sister of Celestial Palace,

416
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:08,240
I must warn you

417
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:09,680
not to hurt innocent people.

418
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:11,680
If the people of your Darknight Court

419
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,720
dare to do harm to the disciples
of our Celestial Palace,

420
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:15,120
I will be the first person
to stand up against you

421
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,440
and to make you pay a price.

422
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:19,320
Zuo Qingluan,

423
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:21,200
aren't you tired living like this?

424
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,240
The goddess of Celestial Palace,
the eldest sister

425
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:26,320
and the top female cultivator

426
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:28,040
are all your identities.

427
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:30,560
But what is the real you?

428
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:32,440
Now you are here to warn me

429
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:33,720
for the sake of the disciples
of your Celestial Palace.

430
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:36,360
You don't really think
I am doing evil, do you?

431
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:41,840
You have lost yourself.

432
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:43,520
It doesn't concern you.

433
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:45,440
We are not people on the same side.

434
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,480
We are not close enough
to bare our souls to each other.

435
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:54,440
In the end, here is my word of warning:

436
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:57,440
don't expose your weakness so early.

437
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:00,080
Otherwise, you will bite the dust.

438
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:01,440
My weakness?

439
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:04,160
Do you mean Jun Linyuan
who is like a fighting cock?

440
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:04,800
No.

441
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,080
I referred to Feng Wu.

442
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:11,280
How about you?

443
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,160
Don't you have any weakness?

444
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:22,120
How could Master Zhao do this to you?

445
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:23,480
It was such a big chunk of ice.

446
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:25,200
You must have used a lot of spirit energy.

447
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:27,920
Wu, have you got sore hands?

448
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:31,680
Wu,

449
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:33,240
what are you mumbling?

450
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,160
I just can't figure it out.

451
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:38,200
With my wisdom,

452
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:39,160
how could I fall into

453
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:41,000
such a small trap of school violence?

454
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:43,480
You said something I can't understand again.

455
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:45,400
School violence.

456
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,080
I have made up my mind

457
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:49,440
to fight against

458
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:50,760
those people who oppressed me.

459
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:54,120
Though I always earn respect
from others with my virtues,

460
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:56,280
I can't allow them to

461
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:57,640
put up airs and bully me.

462
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:00,600
As the saying goes,

463
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:03,000
"If others don't hurt me,
I won't hurt others."

464
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:04,160
If people do harm to me,

465
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:05,440
I will double the harm I do to them.

466
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:07,240
If Mu Yao

467
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:08,960
messes with me again,

468
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:10,840
even if our master imposes punishment on me,

469
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:13,680
I will make her surrender.

470
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:15,440
Well said!

471
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:18,320
Have you got it?

472
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:20,320
Of course I have.

473
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:22,160
You meant that you would
be braver facing trouble

474
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,120
and go ahead fearlessly.

475
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:23,960
Am I right?

476
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:25,120
Yes.

477
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,520
I decide to learn this spirit from you

478
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:31,200
to improve my cooking skills

479
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:34,520
and to make clear my feelings to Yi.

480
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:53,880
Miss Zhao Ge, where is Feng Wu?

481
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:56,640
Wu's food box

482
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:59,000
was thrown onto the ground by somebody.

483
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:01,320
I offered to share half of my food with her.

484
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:02,520
But she refused.

485
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:06,400
The pranks between classmates
have gone over the top.

486
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:08,600
Junwu Academy is a place for character
improvement and spiritual cultivation.

487
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:10,040
How could they do such indecent things?

488
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:11,400
Right. They have gone too far.

489
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:12,440
They can't be allowed to go on doing this.

490
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:14,280
Shall I find out who did this to Feng Wu

491
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:15,360
and punish the person on behalf of Feng Wu?

492
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:16,400
She said she didn't need any help.

493
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:17,760
She has got her own plan.

494
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:19,840
You girls are soft-hearted.

495
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:21,400
You can't connive at such behavior.

496
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:23,720
She said she would
teach the person a lesson herself.

497
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:26,520
I take back my words.

498
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:29,240
It is conceivable that she has said that.

499
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:43,120
Yi.

500
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:45,080
I cooked these under the guidance of Wu.

501
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:46,440
They are different from
the food I cooked earlier.

502
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:47,360
Please taste them.

503
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:48,920
Go ahead.

504
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:17,000
Xuan Yi.

505
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:18,360
If it is so unpalatable
that it has made you speechless,

506
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:19,600
just blink.

507
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:27,440
It is not bad.

508
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:29,000
Really?

509
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:33,440
It is not bad.

510
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:38,480
Today the weather is so fine.

511
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:39,800
It is really a pity that

512
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:40,800
Boss Jun

513
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:43,160
was summoned to Junwu Divine Hall
by the Holy Sovereign and the Holy Queen.

514
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:44,480
I can see that it is late now.

515
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:45,520
The midday class is about to start.

516
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:46,440
If we don't go back now,

517
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:47,840
we will be late for class.

518
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:50,360
Yi,

519
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:52,040
it is still early.

520
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:54,200
Will you eat more cakes?

521
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,120
The class is more important.

522
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:03,920
Yes, right.

523
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:05,680
We have to go attend the class.

524
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:12,920
Yi doesn't seem to like cakes.

525
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:17,240
I will cook something else for him next time.

526
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:26,920
Your Majesties,

527
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:28,000
greetings to you.

528
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:32,040
Crown Prince.

529
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:34,880
Have you got used to your school life?

530
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:36,360
Yes, more or less.

531
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:41,440
It is said that among
the disciples of this year,

532
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:43,680
there are a large number of talents.

533
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:48,400
Thus, you can learn
from your classmates during cultivation.

534
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:53,280
In the future, you will surely contribute
to the prosperity of our Junwu Clan.

535
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:00,720
But, have you had your eye on

536
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:04,520
any female disciple?

537
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:08,480
I have my own thoughts about this.

538
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:10,600
Your Majesty, please don't worry about me.

539
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:13,960
Why did you say this?

540
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:15,640
Is it because you don't trust me

541
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:17,840
or because you think I

542
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:20,360
am incapable of choosing
Spiritual Princess for you?

543
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:22,200
Why did you say you were incapable?

544
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:24,240
In my view,

545
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:26,360
over all the past years,

546
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:29,240
you have been handling
all affairs meticulously

547
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:30,440
and properly.

548
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:33,800
I want you to handle this matter, too.

549
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:35,680
Linyuan is a grown-up now.

550
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:38,920
We'd better choose Spiritual Princess
for him earlier.

551
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:46,200
You need not.

552
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:48,080
Yes, right.

553
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:49,440
Your Majesty,

554
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:51,760
Crown Prince is an adult now.

555
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:53,920
So he must have his own thoughts.

556
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:55,280
I think we'd better not

557
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:57,720
interfere in this too much.

558
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:59,200
He is an adult indeed.

559
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:01,200
So he dares to disobey me now.

560
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:05,080
As the leader of our Junwu Clan,

561
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,800
I don't believe that I can't make you obey.

562
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:08,920
If you insist disobeying me,

563
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:12,840
you shall go to the Sky-reaching Terrace
to kneel for two hours as punishment.

564
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:14,120
Think about it.

565
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:15,320
Your Majesty,

566
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:16,600
you can't do that to him.

567
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:32,080
-He.
-Your Majesty.

568
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:34,440
Why must you be angry with him?

569
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:36,160
He is a grown-up now.

570
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:37,400
After you did this to him,

571
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:39,560
he won't be able to hold up his head

572
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,840
in front of the underlings.

573
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:44,360
He asked for it.

574
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:45,760
It is nobody else's fault.

575
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:56,000
I gave you a lot of examples just now.

576
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:59,040
Now I will ask you questions.

577
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:04,120
If you run into a high-rank
demonic beast in the wild,

578
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,440
what should you do?

579
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:18,080
Mu Yao.

580
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:19,400
Please answer my question.

581
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:24,600
I beg your pardon, Master.

582
00:34:27,710 --> 00:34:29,630
Have you been listening to me?

583
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:36,520
Go out to accept the punishment.

584
00:34:59,670 --> 00:35:00,480
Your Highness Jun,

585
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:02,280
this is the Sky-reaching Terrace.

586
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:03,600
Sorry to see you suffer this time.

587
00:35:03,710 --> 00:35:05,760
Please forgive me for my offence.

588
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:07,080
Never mind.

589
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:09,480
Just do things following the rules.

590
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:10,360
OK.

591
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:12,560
It is said that back then, Master Mu

592
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:14,480
has undergone the heavenly tribulation
and become an immortal here.

593
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:15,560
It is a pity that I wasn't born at that time.

594
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:16,720
So I didn't have the honor
to see his splendid bearing.

595
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:36,840
His Highness Jun is here
to accept punishment.

596
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:38,120
This is humiliating to him.

597
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:39,760
You shouldn't have said so much.

598
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:41,840
I just wanted to talk a bit more
with His Highness

599
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:43,000
to console him.

600
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:50,760
I am wondering what the mistake of

601
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,360
a kind and capable person
like His Highness Jun

602
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:53,560
is exactly.

603
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:54,680
As a result, he has to be punished this way.

604
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:28,280
The class is over.

605
00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:37,700
(Righteous Teaching Hall)

606
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:42,160
Little Feng Wu.

607
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:52,320
Library Pavilion?

608
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:53,000
Yes.

609
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:55,160
But Wu Youdao has been guarding it tightly.

610
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:57,120
I haven't been able to go inside
to ascertain the truth.

611
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:59,040
Wu Youdao

612
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:00,800
is really not easy to deal with.

613
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:03,520
I have ever sent people to assassinate him,

614
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:06,280
but he was saved by Jun Linyuan.

615
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:08,600
After that, he still does things
in his own way

616
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:12,280
as if nothing had happened.

617
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:14,240
No matter what kind of person he is

618
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:15,960
or how powerful he is,

619
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:18,440
I will figure out a way
to find out the truth.

620
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:20,040
If I come across Mu Jiuzhou,

621
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:22,080
I will destroy him physically
and spiritually directly.

622
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:26,640
If Mu Jiuzhou is still alive in this world,

623
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:29,520
with your cultivation base,

624
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:31,520
you will not be able to rival him.

625
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:33,080
Is Mu Jiuzhou

626
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:34,360
really so powerful?

627
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:41,120
In this world, he is the only person

628
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:43,280
that makes me feel inferior.

629
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:45,880
