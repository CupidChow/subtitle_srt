3
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:11,880
No matter how much I want you to stay,

4
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:14,960
your safety and happiness

5
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,040
are the most important.

6
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:43,880
What a weird dream!

7
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,320
Why would Jun Linyuan be here?

8
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,720
I must be dreaming.

9
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:53,960
Who said you were dreaming?

10
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,560
You just haven't woken up.

11
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:01,840
What are you doing here?

12
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,560
This is the female room.

13
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:06,920
Where's Zhao Ge?

14
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:08,960
It's very late already.

15
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,360
Only you were still sleeping.

16
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,000
Get up now.

17
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,320
What for?

18
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:15,680
I'll take you to a place.

19
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:29,480

20
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,840
Feel free to have a look, sir.

21
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:39,000
Why do you suddenly want to shop?

22
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,520
I know

23
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,240
we're in imminent danger now.

24
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,200
But only a dog
will leap over a wall in desperation.

25
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:46,240
You...

26
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:48,960
Alright, I'll stop it.

27
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,880
Master Mu has told me.

28
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,640
He said you were leaving.

29
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,960
I hope today we'll forget everything

30
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,280
and have

and the struggle for power.

00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,080
It's not like

I'll never come back.

00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,520
He needs to cultivate in seclusion

00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:49,240

154

156

Don't you blame me

157

for letting a disciple you
fostered for years die?

158

Junior Sister,

161
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:49,680
you've changed.

162
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,520
When we cultivated together,

163
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,680
you were active and frank.

164
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,680
You took things seriously

165
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,200
and always wanted to win.

166
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,480
So, Master

167
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:03,840
always said you progressed the fastest

168
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,200
and were the craziest about cultivation

169
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,840
among all her disciples.

170
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:13,600
At that time, I was young

171
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,240
and just entered Celestial Palace.

172
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:17,720
Naturally I'd want to achieve something

173
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,640
and be praised by Master.

174
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,600
But however hard I tried,

175
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:24,040
I was still no match for you and...

176
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:27,680
I spoke out of turn.

177
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:29,120
Please forgive me.

178
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:30,440
That's alright.

179
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:33,160
It's just an old friend.

180
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:36,040
I was just the same as you.

181
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:39,520
No matter what I did,

182
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,640
I still didn't compare
with our Senior Sister.

183
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,920
Even if she's dead,

184
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:46,520
I still can't take

185
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:48,800
her place in people's mind.

186
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:54,120
Now that I can't get it,
I'll just destroy it.

187
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:58,080
No one should stand in my way.

188
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:01,320
Those are what I told Qingluan.

189
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:02,600
Junior Sister,

190
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:04,320
do you think I'm right?

191
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:12,960
I'm from the same sect as you.

192
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,280
Certainly I won't oppose you.

193
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:19,400
I'll also discipline
members of Celestial Palace.

194
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:21,640
Please don't worry, Your Majesty.

195
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:26,560
You've been more and more tactful
over the years.

196
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:29,440
I have faith in you.

197
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:33,000
But it seems your daughter,

198
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:37,560
Zhao Ge, is on intimate terms
with Feng Wu.

199
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,760
Zhao Ge is inexperienced

200
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,200
and doesn't have much cultivation base.

201
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:45,640
She won't stand in your way.

202
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,360
I'll keep warning her

203
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:49,240
so that she won't make any mistakes.

204
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:50,800
Good.

205
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:54,280
Jun Linyuan has died.

206
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:57,240
I don't want those kids

207
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:59,200
to be led astray one by one

208
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,040
and go their own way.

209
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:27,480
Mother.

210
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,360
Why are you here?

211
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:41,560
I was going back to Celestial Palace

212
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,960
but I saw you at the entrance to the city.

213
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:47,640
So I waited for you here.

214
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:52,480
If it's about Feng Wu and Jun Linyuan,

215
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:53,560
you could just give up.

216
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:55,440
But His Highness Jun is innocent.

217
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,520
He's the future of Junwu Clan.

218
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:58,240
We shouldn't...

219
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,080
It's unsuitable for us to interfere.

220
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,960
But you and Holy Queen Gao...

221
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:07,400
Zhao Ge,

222
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:11,590
Celestial Palace is not nearly
as powerful as Junwu Clan

223
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,240
on Qianyuan Continent.

224
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:16,160
I don't have enough disciples

225
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,240
to fight with Darknight Court.

226
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,590
And we don't have the geographical advantages
of Penglai Pavilion.

227
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:23,960
I need to respond properly to the situation.

228
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:26,920
I'm not you.

229
00:17:27,590 --> 00:17:29,040
Lives of my disciples,

230
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,720
interests and honor of Celestial Palace
are all on my shoulders.

231
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,640
This decision is inevitable.

232
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,400
I hope you won't meddle in it, either.

233
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:38,320
Understand?

234
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:40,000
Leader,

235
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:41,880
I understand.

236
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,400
But I must protect my friends,

237
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:45,680
my classmates

238
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,200
and the person I like.

239
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:50,640
I beg you

240
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,440
not to be on Holy Queen Gao's side.

241
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:56,120
I don't want a day

242
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:59,560
when I must fight with you.

243
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:13,760
It's useless.

244
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,360
Her majesty told me

245
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:18,240
Jun Linyuan

246
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:19,720
had died.

247
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:21,960
What?

248
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:51,360
Wu.

249
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:53,240
Wu.

250
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:55,800
Wu.

251
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:58,200
Wu,

252
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,920
Holy Queen Gao killed

253
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:02,480
His Highness Jun.

254
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,040
Feng Wu.

255
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:14,440
Wu.

256
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,120
Wu.

257
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:21,120
Go and check what's going on outside.

258
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:22,320
Go.

259
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:29,560
Feng Wu.

260
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:30,840
Master,

261
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:32,840
Jun Linyuan...

262
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:34,520
Jun Linyuan was...

263
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:35,640
Nothing is certain yet.

264
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:36,920
Take it easy.

265
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,480
Calm down and think about nothing.

266
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:40,040
I'll treat you.

267
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:43,800
Feng Wu!

268
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:45,680
Feng Wu!

269
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:57,360
Catch all of them.

270
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:58,040
Yes.

271
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,000
Ask everyone to retreat
and send someone to tell Master.

272
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:08,600
Yes.

273
00:20:58,720 --> 00:20:59,240
Go right now.

274
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:02,960
Quick.

275
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:00,440
How's it going?

276
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:01,440
Let's go now.

277
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:12,480
Go.

278
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:14,880
Quick.

279
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:16,960
Kill them.

280
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:17,680
Catch him.

281
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:50,720
Zhao Ge, it's me.

282
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:52,280
Yi.

283
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:53,280
Men of Darknight Court

284
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,640
have got in through the front door.

285
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:56,520
Where are Master Mu and Feng Wu?

286
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,080
They're upstairs.

287
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,680
Feng Wu knew His Highness Jun was killed

288
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,520
and vomited blood.

289
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,280
If it goes on like this,

290
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:07,120
it'll just be a matter of time
before Junwu Academy is occupied.

291
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:08,520
Listen,

292
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:10,200
take Master Mu and Feng Wu

293
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:12,680
to escape through the passage
at Library Pavilion.

294
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:13,680
Be careful.

295
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,120
Yi.

296
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:18,240
How...

297
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:20,600
how about you?

298
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,120
As a disciple of Junwu Academy,

299
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:28,440
I should stay with it.

300
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:30,360
No.

301
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:33,640
Let's go together.

302
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:35,560
I want to be with you.

303
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:11,560
Zhao Ge,

304
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:13,200
I promise.

305
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:18,080
As long as you escape safely,

306
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,480
I will be alright.

307
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,000
Besides,

308
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:28,400
as you've said,

309
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:30,960
you need to protect Feng Wu.

310
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:33,320
Go.

311
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:39,320
I'll buy enough time for you.

312
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,200
If we go on like this,

313
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,440
we'll all have to die here.

314
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:15,320
I'm not afraid of that.

315
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:17,800
If these people succeed,

316
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:20,440
it'll be a disaster to
the whole Qianyuan Continent.

317
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:22,240
Listen up, everyone.

318
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:25,400
Today we'll stay with
Junwu Academy dead or alive.

319
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:26,560
Yes!

320
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:27,680
Kill them.

321
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:30,320
Kill them!

322
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:47,840
My Lord,

323
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:50,120
Her Majesty wants a quick victory.

324
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:51,920
What's the rush?

325
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:55,000
Isn't it fun to watch them

326
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:56,440
struggling like this?

327
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:57,640
But Her Majesty...

328
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:04,000
You've made me

329
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,480
lose all interest in it.

330
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:07,000
I'll kill them now.

331
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:03,600
What evil spell is this?

332
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:06,560
With this cultivation base, Lord Demon

333
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:09,480
is absolutely not on the level
of a Spiritual Elder.

334
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:18,320
This is

335
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:21,280
how you righteous sects are going to end up.

336
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:11,600
Mu Jiuzhou,

337
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,000
I've warned you.

338
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:15,160
Don't court death.

339
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:18,280
Find a place and wait for your end there.

340
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:20,960
Qianyuan Continent is in trouble.

341
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:24,040
How could I turn a blind eye to it?

342
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:28,200
You're no match for me now.

343
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:30,840
I will make you watch

344
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:34,600
Junwu Academy you founded
being flattened by me.

345
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,680
You still don't get it.

346
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:39,160
The spirit of Junwu Academy

347
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:41,480
is never about these buildings

348
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:43,720
but its people.

349
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:45,480
As long as they're there,

350
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:47,080
Junwu Academy...

351
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:50,960
no,

352
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:56,880
Qianyuan Continent will still have hope.

353
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:05,560
You wanna escape?

354
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:07,840
Stop him!

355
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:18,120
-Master.
-Master Mu.

356
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:31,360
Do you think they'll be safe now?

357
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:34,240
With your spirit energy,

358
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,720
they couldn't go far at all.

359
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:39,440
I will find them

360
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:41,640
and kill them one by one.

361
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:43,920
You

362
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,960
have lost.

363
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:00,640
If Ziyan didn't want you to live,

364
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:03,560
I would kill you now.

365
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:06,280
Take him away.

366
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:18,600
Are you seriously injured?

367
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:19,840
Are you okay?

368
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,000
Are you okay?

369
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,320
I've stopped bleeding.

370
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:32,520
-Are you okay?
-How long do we have to stay here?

371
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:34,680
Are you guys okay?

372
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:38,720
Are you okay?

373
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:42,080
The death of His Highness Jun

374
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:44,840
is really a blow to Wu.

375
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,840
The fact that Master Mu sacrificed himself

376
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:48,720
and asked me to take Wu to hide here

377
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,480
frustrated her, too.

378
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:57,520
Let her be alone for a while.

379
00:31:58,280 --> 00:31:59,000
But...

380
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:18,200
What's going on outside?

381
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:20,320
Men of Darknight Court are everywhere.

382
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:22,160
If they go on like that,

383
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:24,920
we'll be found sooner or later.

384
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:29,360
What have I cultivated for?

385
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:30,560
In times of crisis,

386
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:32,680
I can't even protect my students.

387
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:33,920
It's not your fault.

388
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:35,240
Let's pull together.

389
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:36,520
We can definitely find a way out.

390
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:39,960
Now everyone is hurt.

391
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:41,840
Certainly we can't fight with them.

392
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:43,640
And we have nowhere to hide.

393
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:44,800
Is there really not

394
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:47,280
a place Darknight Court can't find?

395
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:49,000
-Well...
-Yes.

396
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:53,600
I know a place

397
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:55,320
Darknight Court can never find.

398
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:07,680
I never knew

399
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:09,240
such a place before.

400
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:14,680
It's so beautiful.

401
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:15,840
Wu,

402
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,600
how did you find this place?

403
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:26,160
I'm sorry.

404
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:27,640
If we stay here,

405
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,320
Holy Queen Gao
will never be able to trace us.

406
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:34,040
Let the others get some rest

407
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:35,520
and recover from their injuries.

408
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:36,880
Damn you!

409
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:43,000
How could you have no news of them?

410
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:44,150
You're really worthless!

411
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:46,630
I'm sorry, Aunt.

412
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:49,320
I've turned the capital

413
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:50,080
upside down

414
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:51,960
but Feng Wu and the others

415
00:34:52,150 --> 00:34:53,560
are nowhere in sight

416
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,280
as if they've disappeared.

417
00:34:56,150 --> 00:34:57,080
A bunch of bums.

418
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:58,520
You're all a bunch of bums!

419
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,280
Has Mu Jiuzhou

420
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,280
sent them to heaven?

421
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:07,040
We can't keep looking for them like this.

422
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:09,600
I have a solution.

423
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:12,200
Say it.

424
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:15,400
Mu Jiuzhou is still in our hands.

425
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,600
Why don't we use him as a bait

426
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:18,880
to force them to come?

427
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,720
You could sentence Mu Jiuzhou in public

428
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:26,120
and turn him into ash
with the Bone-eroding Thunder.

429
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:28,680
Then release this piece of news.

430
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:31,520
If Feng Wu and the others come to his rescue,

431
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,120
we can wipe them all out.

432
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:36,120
What if they don't come?

433
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:37,720
That's even better.

434
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:40,200
Without Mu Jiuzhou,

435
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:42,840
they'll just be a disorganized rabble

436
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:44,600
which we don't have to fear at all.

437
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:46,840
The Bone-eroding Thunder

438
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:50,400
can't be stopped once it's made.

439
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:54,440
Lord Demon,

440
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:57,520
how urgent are you to

441
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:59,480
dispose of Mu Jiuzhou?

442
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:00,520
Your Majesty,

443
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:03,680
I just want to help you solve the problem.

444
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:05,640
If you can't bear to kill him,

445
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:07,200
just forget what I said.

446
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:31,800
Alright,

447
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:34,320
we'll do what you said.

448
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,200
Let people know that he'll be sentenced

449
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,800
at the Sky-reaching Terrace three days later.

450
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:40,680
I would love to see

451
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,480
whether his dear disciple

452
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:44,720
will watch her Master

453
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,120
die again.

454
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:05,560
Your Majesty.

455
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:09,360
Open the door.

456
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:15,840
Leave here.

457
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:37,680
I'm here to tell you

458
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:39,480
three days later,

459
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,040
I'll sentence you at the Sky-reaching Terrace

460
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:43,920
and turn you into ash

461
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:46,440
with the Bone-eroding Thunder.

462
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:48,360
You won't suffer

463
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:51,320
less than when you ascended to immortality.

464
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:52,800
And then

465
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:55,400
you'll really be dead

466
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:58,680
and never come back.

467
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:05,960
Ziyan,

468
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:10,640
when did you become like this?

469
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:14,280
The cause of everything I did

470
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:16,800
is you.

471
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:19,320
How could you ask me

472
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:22,200
when I became like this?

473
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:26,960
You're a smart person.

474
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:29,400
You must have realized

475
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:31,880
that your years of planning

476
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:33,600
is just because of your obsession

477
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:35,720
but not me.

478
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:40,560
Impossible.

479
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:43,080
Me and my Senior Sister

480
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:45,200
met you at the same time.

481
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:47,760
We fixed the energy barrier

482
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:50,360
and pacified demonic beasts together.

483
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:52,800
But you had your eye

484
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:55,200
on my Senior Sister.

485
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:57,840
When she died,

486
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:01,520
I thought I finally got a chance

487
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:04,720
to take her place.

488
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:08,040
But you told me

489
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:11,080
you only wanted to cultivate.

490
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:14,760
How could I let you get your wish?

491
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:17,240
People all think

492
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:18,960
I only love power.

493
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:22,520
They don't know what I want

494
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:26,840
is just the love of my beloved.

495
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:32,840
Now that you cherish
Qianyuan Continent so much

496
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:34,920
and only want to protect
the cultivation world,

497
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:37,360
then I will get it at all costs

498
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:39,120
and destroy it myself.

499
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:39,880
Ziyan,

500
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:43,840
it's just your wishful thinking.

501
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:46,120
As long as you stop now,

502
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:48,600
everything can still be retrieved.

503
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:52,680
I've planed for years

504
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,680
and this is the last thing I need to do.

505
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:58,760
I must complete it.

506
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:11,320
Only when you're dead

507
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:16,240
will all the past events

508
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:20,320
be settled

509
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:22,520
completely.

510
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:48,880
Things change in the world.

511
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:52,400
My fate has been decided.

512
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,120
Feng Wu,

513
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:57,880
Jun Linyuan,

514
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,240
now

515
