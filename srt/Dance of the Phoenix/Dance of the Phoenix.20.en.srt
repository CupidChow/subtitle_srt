(Episode 20)

3
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:47,720
Master.

4
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:06,840
Senior Sister.

5
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:12,840
You've practiced tens of thousands of times.

6
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,760
How come you still
made mistakes in the fight?

7
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,000
Is it that you haven't been

8
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,920
paying attention to your cultivation

9
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,280
and slacking behind my back?

10
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:20,920
No, Master.

11
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,640
I was just too nervous.

12
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:23,560
Remember.

13
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:26,040
You must be the Celestial Palace's
best disciple

14
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,520
and make the Celestial Palace thrive.

15
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:28,840
Only then

16
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,720
will I be proud of you.

17
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:44,920
Senior Sister.

18
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:46,760
Zhao Ge.

19
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:48,280
Zhao Ge.

20
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:51,600
What took you so long this time?

21
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,240
The leader of the Celestial Palace told me

22
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:56,000
to stay longer in the capital.

23
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,320
Senior Sister.

24
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,760
Were you troubled

25
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,480
by the fact that I didn't return?

26
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,640
Were you chided?

27
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,240
Don't be like this, Senior Sister.

28
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,280
You know

29
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:10,640
the leader of the Celestial Palace cares
the most about your cultivation base.

30
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,480
I only care

31
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,800
if you are doing well or not.

32
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,400
I'm doing well at the Celestial Palace.

33
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,920
Zhao Ge, have you made any progress
with your cultivation base?

34
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,480
Now that you are back,

35
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,080
you won't go to the capital again, right?

36
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,080
I...

37
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,560
Senior Sister, it's okay.

38
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:37,640
Since childhood,

39
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:40,040
I have often been banished
to the capital for cultivation.

40
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,560
And I still haven't given up.

41
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,080
All the more reason
that you shouldn't give up.

42
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,960
The leader of the Celestial Palace

43
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:49,200
shows you tough love
because she's placed high hopes on you.

44
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,360
You must spare no effort to cultivate.

45
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:55,760
I'm waiting for your name
to be known across Qianyuan Continent.

46
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:02,800
Does it hurt?

47
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,440
Cheer up, Senior Sister.

48
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,160
Goddess Zuo.

49
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:23,720
Goddess Zuo, wait.

50
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,080
Her Majesty invites you to her place.

51
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,600
Your Majesty.

52
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,240
You're used to being highly prized.

53
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,680
Now you hit the lowest point in life.

54
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,360
It must be tough.

55
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,120
But it's not that bad.

56
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:01,720
Feng Wu suffered for years

57
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:04,400
after you took her Phoenix Blood.

58
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,320
You're suffering less than she was.

59
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,520
What?

60
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:12,440
You can't take your show
being stolen for once?

61
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:15,960
I won't let anyone take
anything from me again.

62
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:17,760
From you?

63
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,440
Nothing is destined to belong

64
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:24,520
to anyone in this world.

65
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,000
Whoever grabs the thing keeps the thing.

66
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,200
I'm surprised

67
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:33,000
that you chose to open your heart

68
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,800
to me at this time.

69
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,440
Don't be surprised.

70
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,520
I didn't judge you wrong.

71
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:02,360
You and I are people of the same kind.

72
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,720
I'd serve you, Your Majesty.

73
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,040
Do you love Jun Linyuan?

74
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:19,080
I just love the feeling of winning.

75
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:38,680
You are back.

76
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:32,760
What do you want?

77
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,360
Never mind.

78
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,480
You performed a sword dance
in harmony with Feng Wu.

79
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:45,240
From your looks I could tell
that you were in love.

80
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,320
What can I want?

81
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,960
I want nothing.

82
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,000
You

83
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,800
shouldn't have wanted anything
in the first place.

84
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:54,600
I...

85
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,800
Whatever.

86
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,320
You spoke honestly

87
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,080
in public.

88
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,880
I kind of admire you for that.

89
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:09,000
One of you is my Boss Jun

90
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,760
and the other one is my good sister.

91
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:15,040
Anyway,

92
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,000
be careful not to let anyone

93
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:20,280
steal Feng Wu from you.

94
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,120
Yu Mingye

95
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,640
feels strange to me.

96
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:53,720
Supervisor Wu.

97
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:08,320
All the old man does

98
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:11,320
is to read books and roam around.

99
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,520
He has enormous spirit energy,

100
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,200
but he acts like an idler.

101
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:18,720
Something must be wrong.

102
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:23,680
Look at that person.

103
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,400
He is being sneaky.

104
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,120
I wonder what he is up to.

105
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,600
He is from the Darknight Court.

106
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,200
He is not our kind.

107
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,120
Why can't he be aboveboard?

108
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,600
-Let's go.
-Come on.

109
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:44,800
The teacher gave a lesson

110
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,360
that really confused me.

111
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,880
Wu, do you know

112
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,400
how to take notes faster?

113
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,000
Yeah. Let me tell you.

114
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,320
See? I've told you.

115
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,080
There's nothing to worry about
when Wu is around.

116
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:57,880
Not here. There are people around us.

117
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,200
Wu.

118
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,440
Zhao Ge, I'm suddenly suffering
from a severe stomachache.

119
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,760
I'll get back to my room.

120
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,520
Wu.

121
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,480
Did Wu eat something that made her sick?

122
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:12,080
She's going to suffer.

123
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:19,960
Stop pressing me. Stop pressing me.

124
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,360
Why did you press me to come?

125
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,080
What?

126
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:40,040
You don't even respond to me.

127
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,880
I can feel the intense vibration.

128
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:45,480
What?

129
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:49,440
The second Star Shard will appear soon.

130
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:50,680
Not just that.

131
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,880
Great events might take place in the Academy.

132
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:55,160
Great events?

133
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,360
What kind of great events?

134
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:58,800
I don't know.

135
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:01,080
But my instinct is always right.

136
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,440
It's not a good omen.

137
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:14,480
It must be a warning for you and me.

138
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:15,480
A warning?

139
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:17,880
Don't drop your guard.

140
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:19,920
If you need me,

141
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,360
feel free to summon me.

142
00:11:59,200 --> 00:11:59,960
Hey.

143
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,680
You didn't have to make so much noise

144
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,200
for your swordsmanship training.

145
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,680
The noise you made woke me up.

146
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,800
I'm in a bad mood.

147
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:08,920
You'd better stay away from me.

148
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:09,760
Don't bother me.

149
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,920
So what if you are in a bad mood?

150
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,000
I've never seen you smile

151
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,760
in Junwu Academy.

152
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:16,240
Besides,

153
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,520
you think I'm the obedient type of person?

154
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:19,960
What do you want?

155
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,440
I've told you

156
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:26,560
I don't care about your scheme.

157
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,880
But if your scheme hurts Feng Wu,

158
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:31,280
I won't spare you.

159
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:33,120
Why does everyone like Feng Wu?

160
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,760
I don't want everyone to like her, either.

161
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,200
I wish I were the only one who liked her.

162
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,600
But it is what it is.

163
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:41,800
I can't do anything about it.

164
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:44,440
Don't you think your words sound weird?

165
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,440
What's so weird about them?

166
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:49,640
A lot of people envy you.

167
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,000
For instance,

168
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:53,240
your slow-witted junior sister.

169
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,440
I don't have time to joke around.

170
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:00,400
You are overly serious.

171
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:01,960
Boring.

172
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:12,280
Yi, come here.

173
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,760
Miss Zhao Ge, what's the matter?

174
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:22,360
Yi,

175
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,000
I've just learned how to make these cakes.

176
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,440
They said these cakes were delicious.

177
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:26,400
Have a try.

178
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:35,840
Yi.

179
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:38,040
Are you mad at me?

180
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:43,400
You just recovered.

181
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:45,600
If you had possessed more spirit energy,

182
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,160
you wouldn't have been beaten so badly.

183
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:55,000
Are you worried about me?

184
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:57,800
You think too much.

185
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,520
I will teach you next time.

186
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,000
Thank you.

187
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:19,720
Wu.

188
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,560
Do you know what day tomorrow is?

189
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,000
Tomorrow?

190
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:27,960
It's Chinese Valentine's Day.

191
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:30,240
Are you going to celebrate it with me?

192
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:31,760
No.

193
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:34,160
There is going to be
a lantern show on Chinese Valentine's Day.

194
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:37,880
Men and women usually meet on this day
to watch the lantern show together.

195
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,960
A woman may write letters to a man.

196
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:42,840
If a man shows up on a date,
then he and she have feelings for each other.

197
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,200
Will you write a letter?

198
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,640
No.

199
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,760
I'm bad at writing disgustingly sweet prose.

200
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,400
What's wrong with disgustingly sweet prose?

201
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:55,120
His Highness Jun has made
a promise to you in public.

202
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:57,160
And I heard

203
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,200
that though the students

204
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:00,680
supported you strongly,

205
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:02,240
many female students

206
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,880
still loved His Highness Jun.

207
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:05,880
They think

208
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:08,480
you won't be able
to recover your Phoenix Blood.

209
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:11,240
I'm sure many people
will write to His Highness Jun.

210
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,360
Don't fall behind.

211
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:34,800
Yi.

212
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,440
Linyuan.

213
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:04,280
No. No. No.

214
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:09,560
Jun Linyuan.

215
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,240
This is so tough.

216
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:35,800
My Lord,

217
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,360
I have explored Junwu Academy.

218
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,720
But I haven't found any more clues.

219
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:42,280
I'll hasten to investigate further.

220
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:45,800
But I'm not in a good mood.

221
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:47,320
Please forgive my rudeness.

222
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,440
I'll ask you for punishment another day.

223
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:08,070
What happened?

224
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:09,350
Nothing.

225
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:10,920
It won't hinder my mission.

226
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:13,480
Do you remember

227
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,240
when you stopped calling me "Father"?

228
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:17,480
I do.

229
00:17:18,110 --> 00:17:19,800
When I completed my first mission

230
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:22,040
and killed people.

231
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:31,120
So many years have gone by.

232
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:32,920
You have grown up.

233
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,800
You can take charge now.

234
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:45,960
Stop playing happy families.

235
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,800
The Darknight Court doesn't
have that sort of bullshit rules.

236
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:51,760
You told me so.

237
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:54,720
Power.

238
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,480
There is only absolute power.

239
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:59,520
Is that the reason you are upset?

240
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:01,440
No.

241
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,120
I just don't want them

242
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,640
to slander the Darknight Court.

243
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,120
You don't want them to slander us?

244
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:09,720
Then beat them into losing
the guts to slander us.

245
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:14,280
Only real power

246
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,640
and absolute control

247
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:18,880
can shut their mouth.

248
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:20,600
But what will they think?

249
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:23,280
Can we control what they think?

250
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:24,920
Does it matter?

251
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:29,360
What matters is to deprive them
of the courage to take action.

252
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,320
What they think of us

253
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:33,720
and how they see us

254
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,400
don't matter.

255
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:39,120
When you are at the top,

256
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:41,920
you only see the upper part of their heads

257
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:45,720
and you don't need
to care about their opinions.

258
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:48,440
Do you understand?

259
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:32,560
Oh no.

260
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:34,460
(The Nature of Water and Fire)

261
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:39,980
(Jun Linyuan)

262
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:40,920
Well.

263
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:44,360
There are a great many women
chasing Jun Linyuan.

264
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:45,880
I finally decided

265
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:47,560
(Jun Linyuan)
to tell you about my feelings.

266
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:49,320
I wrote until midnight.

267
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:51,720
Never mind.

268
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:59,980
(The Nature of Water and Fire)

269
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,000
I'm fine with this.

270
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,000
Well? Did you send the letter?

271
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,760
Yeah, I've sent it.

272
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:07,720
Good.

273
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:08,960
Let's have dinner.

274
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:09,960
Yes.

275
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:12,080
Why are you being so sneaky?

276
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,400
Damn it, Xuan Yi

277
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:20,540
hasn't returned the book he borrowed.

278
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:21,140
(The Nature of Water and Fire)

279
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:31,240
Look.

280
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:32,520
Look.

281
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:35,000
Ask me out for the lantern show.

282
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:36,400
I wondered

283
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:39,080
why Zhao Ge had been
making me delicious food,

284
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:41,160
seeking my opinions,

285
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,040
and observing my reactions.

286
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:44,560
It turns out she likes me.

287
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:45,800
Right.

288
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:47,600
I'm the charming

289
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:49,240
Young Master Feng.

290
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:51,120
It's only natural

291
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:53,040
that a woman is attracted to me.

292
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,200
Xuan Yi, why aren't you talking?

293
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:01,880
You are holding a book upside down.

294
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,520
It isn't how you should read a book.

295
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:05,400
It's none of your business.

296
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:06,560
Meddlesome.

297
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,920
Fine. I'll leave you alone.

298
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:10,640
I'm going back to change my clothes.

299
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:11,600
Can't talk to you anymore.

300
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:12,880
After all, I'll be seeing a girl.

301
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:14,240
I need to dress up.

302
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:15,560
Got to go.

303
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:31,680
Do women nowadays

304
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:34,920
transfer their love so quickly?

305
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:38,680
Are women nowadays

306
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:41,640
too reserved to do anything?

307
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:46,320
Boss Jun.

308
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,360
Didn't you receive the letter?

309
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,440
Feng Wu didn't write you a letter?

310
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:03,800
She shunned me for a while.

311
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:05,680
Some days ago,

312
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:07,280
we practiced sword fighting together

313
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:09,320
and our relationship finally
became less tense.

314
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:12,640
Now she is neither hostile
nor friendly toward me.

315
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:14,320
Then

316
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,720
you probably didn't clarify things.

317
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,320
If the mountain doesn't come to me,

318
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:31,080
I'll go to the mountain.

319
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:48,000
Wu, you really aren't going out?

320
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:48,880
I'll be gone.

321
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,080
No.

322
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:52,240
I have herbs to process.

323
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:53,800
You may have fun with Xuan Yi.

324
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:57,520
I don't even know if Yi will show up.

325
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:01,000
A lot of girls wrote to him.

326
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:03,040
I don't count for much.

327
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:04,720
Zhao Ge.

328
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:06,920
He will show up if he has read your letter.

329
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:07,840
Really?

330
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:18,760
I wonder who Jun Linyuan

331
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:20,440
is going with to the lantern show.

332
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:14,200
Your Majesty!

333
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,640
-Your Majesty! Your Majesty!
-Your Majesty!

334
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:18,960
-Your Majesty!
-Help! He is unwell!

335
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,760
-Your Majesty, what happened to you?
-His Majesty has passed out.

336
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:21,880
Your Majesty.

337
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:25,840
Your Highness Jun.

338
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:32,360
What's the matter?

339
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:34,120
His Majesty fell sick.

340
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:49,800
Pick one.

341
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:51,760
Come and have a look, miss.

342
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,360
Look how nice our lanterns are.

343
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:19,640
He still hasn't shown up.

344
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:22,840
Miss Zhao Ge.

345
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:24,680
It's you?

346
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:26,120
Of course it's me.

347
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:26,640
Look.

348
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:28,920
I've even changed my clothes for you.

349
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:29,840
You must have waited for a long time.

350
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:30,840
Sorry.

351
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:32,200
I'm not...

352
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,120
Not what?

353
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:35,320
Yi.

354
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,000
Xuan Yi, why are you also here?

355
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:39,320
Just admit it.

356
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:40,880
You can't do without me, right?

357
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:42,920
Miss Zhao Ge, don't mind him.

358
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,640
Xuan Yi can't live without me.

359
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:46,600
It's okay.

360
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:48,600
Zhao Ge and I will bring you along. Come on.

361
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:51,560
How lively.

362
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:52,560
Look at that.

363
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:55,640
If only Feng Wu

364
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:57,200
and Boss Jun were here.

365
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:59,160
It'd be fun for all of us to hang out.

366
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:00,280
This is just lively.

367
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,760
I didn't expect to see
so many people at the lantern show.

368
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,240
Xuan Yi, cheer up.

369
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:05,360
Miss Zhao Ge and I brought you
along to the lantern show.

370
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:06,680
There's no reason for you to be upset.

371
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,080
Stop pulling a long face.

372
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:09,880
I wonder where Boss Jun and Feng Wu

373
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:10,880
are now.

374
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:14,080
Look. It's such fun.

375
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:17,000
I can't believe people of all ages come here.

376
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:53,120
Here.

377
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:57,240
It's you.

378
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:00,000
Of course it's me.

379
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:05,800
What are you doing here?

380
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:07,520
Today is the day of the lantern show.

381
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:08,920
Madam sent me here to ask you

382
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:10,240
if you'd like to appreciate
the lanterns outside.

383
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:13,000
You lost your spare clothes.

384
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:13,840
So I've brought you some clothing items.

385
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,480
Let's go, My Lady.

386
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:25,960
Everyone went out.

387
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:28,120
What are you doing here?

388
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:30,240
I have nothing to do.

389
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:34,200
The man I'm hoping to see hasn't come to me.

390
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:40,920
So you're waiting for someone.

391
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:46,640
I'll go home and tell Madam

392
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:47,920
that I'll be the only person

393
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:50,360
appreciating the lanterns with her.

394
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:53,400
Madam will be heartbroken.

395
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,240
You troublemaker.

396
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:58,960
Just tell her that I have too much homework

397
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:00,200
to find the time.

398
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:02,400
I wonder how awful Madam will feel

399
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,120
if she knows about this.

400
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:07,960
You just can't keep a grownup daughter.

401
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:09,800
You...

402
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:14,440
This is for satirizing me.
This is for satirizing me.

403
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:15,880
-Don't you satirize me!
-I'm sorry.

404
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:17,360
-I'm sorry.
-Don't you satirize me again!

405
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:18,800
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

406
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:19,880
My Lady,

407
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,600
when will His Highness Jun come?

408
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,880
The lantern show might end soon.

409
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:28,000
Who says I'm waiting for him?

410
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:31,400
You're not waiting for him?

411
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:32,720
Then whom are you waiting for?

412
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:34,720
Come on, My Lady,

413
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:37,760
your look betrayed you.

414
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:42,920
Seriously.

415
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:44,920
What's the time you set for the date?

416
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:47,080
I don't have a date.

417
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:49,520
What?

418
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:52,440
On this kind of day,

419
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,400
he should come to me

420
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,560
even if I haven't asked him out.

421
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:24,960
Dean Ning, how is the Holy Sovereign?

422
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:27,520
He is fine.

423
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:30,040
Perhaps he has worked too hard

424
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:31,720
and worn himself out.

425
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:36,320
Good to know. Good to know.

426
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:44,120
Your Majesty. Dean Ning.

427
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:46,000
Spare the formalities.

428
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:48,120
Qingluan, you came too.

429
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:49,000
Yes.

430
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:50,400
At the Academy's gate,

431
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:52,200
I ran into a guard
who was going to send word.

432
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:55,040
So I took the liberty
of informing His Highness Jun.

433
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:58,040
I was worried about
the Holy Sovereign's health

434
00:29:58,440 --> 00:29:59,880
and came along.

435
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,720
How is the Holy Sovereign?

436
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:03,920
Fortunately, the maid noticed
his illness in time

437
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,120
and summoned Dean Ning here for diagnosis.

438
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:09,240
His condition has stabilized.

439
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:11,360
Dean Ning has great medical skills.

440
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:13,440
Linyuan, don't worry too much.

441
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:15,640
His Majesty fasted and sat in meditation

442
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:17,840
for days to cultivate.

443
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,600
All he ingested was water.

444
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:21,600
Even with his spirit energy protecting him,

445
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:23,400
he couldn't hold on.

446
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:30,480
Dean Ning, thank you for your service.

447
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:31,800
Let me see you off.

448
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:33,080
Thank you.

449
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:37,280
Excuse me then.

450
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:38,960
Thank you.

451
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:13,440
Dean Ning.

452
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:16,120
Did you want me out to tell me something?

453
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,120
Is it about the Holy Sovereign's health?

454
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,000
To tell you the truth,

455
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:28,320
I found an external force

456
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:31,400
stopping the Holy Sovereign's spirit energy

457
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:32,960
from coming together

458
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,600
and there were signs
of his spirit energy waning.

459
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:35,560
External force?

460
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:38,160
Are you saying...

461
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:41,240
It's a rare case.

462
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:42,800
I have my speculations,

463
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:44,840
but I dare not draw any conclusion.

464
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:46,600
I need to get back and consult books

465
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:49,360
to find the cause.

466
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,960
Don't worry too much.

467
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:56,920
The Holy Sovereign often ingested medicines.

468
00:31:57,080 --> 00:32:00,240
Perhaps some medicines worked
against each other.

469
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:02,240
We can't be sure yet.

470
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:03,760
Dean Ning.

471
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:05,920
You just said

472
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:07,840
something about speculations.

473
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:09,840
Do you mind telling me your speculations?

474
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:16,680
As far as I know,

475
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:17,920
there is a rare plant
called Spirit Waning Herb

476
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:21,560
in the West Region.

477
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:24,880
Any cultivator who ingests the herb

478
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:26,760
will show such symptoms.

479
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:28,920
You mean someone...

480
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:32,240
I don't have any evidence yet.

481
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:33,600
Don't worry, Your Highness.

482
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,360
I'll go to the Library Pavilion

483
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:36,640
-to consult the books
-Library Pavilion?

484
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,280
and do some research.

485
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:40,600
Alright.

486
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,480
Thank you, Dean Ning.

487
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:44,280
One more thing.

488
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,680
You must stay at the Holy Sovereign's side

489
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,240
before he wakes up,

490
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:50,960
lest anyone should harm him.

491
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:37,560
Your Majesty.

492
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:39,680
Cailin.

493
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:44,160
How long has it been

494
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,080
since I sent you to
the Holy Sovereign's place

495
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:47,560
to serve him?

496
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:50,240
It has been three years.

497
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:52,600
Have you forgotten

498
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:55,240
why I sent you there

499
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:59,400
and who is your real master?

500
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:00,240
I dare not forget.

501
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,720
Your goodness has made me a better person.

502
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:04,680
You have always been my only master.

503
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:07,080
You sent me there

504
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:10,320
to record the things Holy Sovereign did

505
00:34:11,630 --> 00:34:14,080
and help him ingest the pill
every day on time.

506
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:15,670
For three years,

507
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:17,480
I have kept it in mind

508
00:34:17,630 --> 00:34:19,320
and never forgotten it once.

509
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:22,880
Then tell me.

510
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:27,190
How many times should
he ingest the pill a day?

511
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:30,670
And how many pills should he ingest once?

512
00:34:31,670 --> 00:34:32,480
One time.

513
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:35,080
One pill. Your Majesty,
I have realized my mistake.

514
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:40,280
His Majesty...

515
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:42,880
His Majesty obtained
a celestial book recently.

516
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,800
He said he didn't have enough spirit energy
to learn from the book

517
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:46,230
and wanted to increase
his spirit energy soon.

518
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:47,520
So he asked me to bring out

519
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:48,440
all the pills for him to ingest

520
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:50,800
these days.

521
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:52,360
I...

522
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,230
I didn't watch him closely enough.

523
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:56,520
He might have ingested a few more pills.

524
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:58,680
So you just didn't watch him closely.

525
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:01,680
What a way to underplay the situation.

526
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:04,960
I had him ingest one pill a day

527
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:08,440
to make sure the pill
could take effect slowly.

528
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,240
Years later,

529
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,720
no one would know why he fell ill.

530
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:15,000
Now look what you have done.

531
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:17,360
The pill took effect ahead of schedule,

532
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,720
ruining my grand plan.

533
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,320
Your Majesty. Your Majesty.

534
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:23,480
I've realized my mistake.

535
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:24,360
But...

536
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:26,280
but the Holy Sovereign ordered me to do that.

537
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:29,360
I dared not disobey him, Your Majesty.

538
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,360
In the past,

539
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:37,640
I pulled you out of that abyss of death.

540
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,000
You have shown me such kindness

541
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:40,720
that I won't even be able
to repay you in next life.

542
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,640
Don't wait for next life.

543
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:45,280
You can repay me in this life.

544
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:10,640
Your Majesty.

545
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:15,600
This corpse might cause trouble
if we leave it here.

546
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:18,120
Do you need me to take care of it?

547
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:19,680
No.

548
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:23,280
The corpse is still useful to me.

549
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:26,880
I'll use it to make arrangements.

550
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:48,840
Your Highness,

551
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:50,880
the situation is clear now.

552
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:53,160
The maid called Cailin

553
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:55,440
colluded with foreigners
outside Qianyuan Continent

554
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,680
and lay low at the Holy Sovereign's side,
seeking a chance to poison him.

555
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:00,240
Now the truth is out,

556
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,000
she hanged herself.

557
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:04,320
A mere maid

558
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:07,080
couldn't have the ability and courage
to commit such a crime.

559
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:07,960
Yes.

560
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:10,040
Someone must have ordered her.

561
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:12,760
Her suicide note pointed out

562
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:14,760
that she colluded with someone

563
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,960
and exchanged information
within Junwu Academy.

564
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:19,600
I think her accomplice

565
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:22,000
is hiding in Junwu Academy.

566
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:23,920
We need to give this matter further thought.

567
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:27,000
A dead maid's suicide note

568
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:28,720
is not enough evidence to make a judgment.

569
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:32,560
Linyuan, I know you are kind-hearted

570
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:35,520
and you refuse to believe
there are sinister people

571
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:37,120
around us.

572
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:39,560
But things have happened already.

573
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:41,560
As the Crown Prince of Junwu Clan,

574
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:42,960
you must shoulder the responsibility

575
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:44,320
and face the reality.

576
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:48,320
We can't await our doom.

577
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,960
Gao Wei, convey my order.

578
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:51,840
Gather the Academy's cultivators

579
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:54,200
with a rank higher than
a senior-rank spiritual practitioner's rank

580
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:55,520
in Xuanwu Hall.

581
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:56,880
Control them strictly.

582
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:58,760
It can't be an average cultivator

583
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:00,440
who met with the foreigners.

584
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:01,280
Yes.

585
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:01,960
Your Majesty.

586
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:02,920
Linyuan.

587
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:05,680
Stay here and take care
of the Holy Sovereign.

588
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:09,360
Leave the rest to me.

589
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:17,720
Why are you here?

590
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:20,680
Qingluan was worried
about the Holy Sovereign's health.

591
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:22,440
She was also worried

592
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:25,080
that taking care of the Holy Sovereign
would tire you out.

593
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:27,720
So she came to help.

594
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:28,880
Yes.

595
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:32,360
I was worried that you might lose
your cool out of concern.

596
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:33,280
No need.

597
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:36,080
I can take care of him.
I don't need any help.

598
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,560
Why are you being so stubborn?

599
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:40,080
She is here already.

600
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:42,400
You can't just tell her to go back.

601
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:44,680
Alright.

602
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:47,680
We won't bother the Holy Sovereign anymore.

603
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,400
Take care of him.

604
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:52,680
Gao Wei, let's go.

605
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:05,480
You don't have to bother with me.

606
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:06,320
Go.

607
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:10,400
I have things to do.

608
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:11,840
I won't disturb you.

609
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:13,440
In that case,

610
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:15,000
let's not disturb each other.

611
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:19,280
You don't have to embarrass other people.

612
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:23,400
I'll visit the Holy Sovereign soon.

613
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:33,760
This is the medicine for the Holy Sovereign.

614
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:41,480
It looks like what Zuo Qingluan really wants

615
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:44,160
is not the Spiritual Princess' title.
