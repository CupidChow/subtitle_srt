=Dance of the Phoenix=

2
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:40,340
(Episode 9)

3
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:42,720
Look at this.

4
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:44,980
(Junwu Gate)

5
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:48,760
It says I bring people happiness and peace

6
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,440
and I can definitely
be an immortal in the future.

7
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,240
And this.

8
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:59,240
It says I'm a good king
that's on a par with Liu Bei.

9
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:02,780
(Your Majesty is a good king
that's on a par with Liu Bei.)

10
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,280
Who's Liu Bei?

11
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,640
Have you heard about him?

12
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,400
Your Majesty,

13
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:14,840
were these written
by the Crown Prince himself?

14
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:17,520
He's so admired in the border

15
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,160
that its people volunteered

16
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:21,520
to send me this collection
of birthday blessings.

17
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,400
I can hardly go through them all.

18
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,560
There are so many of them.

19
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,000
It's very considerate of the Crown Prince

20
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:29,880
to prepare this special gift
for Your Majesty.

21
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:32,960
It would be perfect

22
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:35,120
if the Celestial Fruit were here, too.

23
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,200
Besides,

24
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,240
the Crown Prince had
this Millennia-Old Ice Jade Pillow

25
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:40,440
from Penglai sent here as well.

26
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,080
I could use it at night

27
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:44,120
as a perfect complement

28
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,960
to my daytime cultivation.

29
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,840
Let's forget

30
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,040
about that Celestial Fruit.

31
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,720
Right.

32
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,200
The Crown Prince is really sweet

33
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,720
and filial.

34
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,640
Blessed with such a worthy son,

35
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,760
Your Majesty will surely enjoy longevity.

36
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:01,560
I agree.

37
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,480
Yes?

38
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,200
Why don't you

39
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:29,920
come in and tell me about it?

40
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,440
What is this?

41
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,160
I saw it in the market today.

42
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:01,760
It's for me?

43
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:03,480
No. It's nothing particular.

44
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,680
So you bought one

45
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,160
for Feng Liu

46
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:09,720
and Qiu Ling as well?

47
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,160
See?

48
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,360
It's a gift for me after all.

49
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,960
It's nothing special.

50
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,640
Think of it as a token of my gratitude

51
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,440
for your hard work lately.

52
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:22,080
Just admit that it's a gift for me.

53
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,600
There's no need to beat about the bush.

54
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,120
Thanks.

55
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,360
Did you give me this comb

56
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,000
to make me

57
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,400
think of you

58
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,720
every time I comb my hair?

59
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:46,040
Get over yourself.

60
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,880
Come on.

61
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,520
I know your words belie your mind

62
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,040
because of that Loveless Insect Venom.

63
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,560
We'll be doomed

64
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,280
if we keep sitting idle

65
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,840
and watching Feng Wu gain a foothold.

66
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:21,880
Considering the current situation,

67
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,200
we mustn't let Feng Wu leave the Border City.

68
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,000
She must get married here.

69
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,720
Once she returns to the capital,

70
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,080
you and I

71
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,320
along with our father

72
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:34,120
might lose our present status.

73
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,000
Don't worry.

74
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:38,640
I've got the right person for the job.

75
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,520
What happened?

76
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,480
Why are you so angry?

77
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,120
Did Feng Liu

78
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,640
upset you again?

79
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:51,960
Hello, Young Master Feng.

80
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,200
Hello, Young Master Xuan.

81
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:55,640
Where's your young lady?

82
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,240
She...

83
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:01,040
Young Master bullied her into going out

84
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,800
with him on the excuse of her mom.

85
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:06,080
They've gone to the main street
in the north of the city.

86
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:08,920
I'm going with you.

87
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:11,480
Don't make things worse.

88
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:18,040
I must be a fool

89
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,480
to come and see

90
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,880
what Feng Yiran is playing at.

91
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,440
This is it?

92
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:26,720
Dad.

93
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:28,960
Miss Wu.

94
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,400
Since my son likes you so much,

95
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,440
I'm not going to object to it.

96
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,880
There's nothing we couldn't give you,

97
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,960
Miss Wu.

98
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:40,880
Cousin,

99
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,760
since Mr. Bi has given his assent,

100
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,040
you should commit yourself.

101
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,680
What are you talking about?

102
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,200
Your Highness Jun.

103
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:51,960
Your Highness Jun.

104
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:52,960
To what do I owe the pleasure?

105
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,600
How dare you abduct my fiancee?

106
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,440
Am I invisible to you?

107
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:02,640
My intended Spiritual Princess
almost got abducted.

108
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:03,680
And you asked me

109
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,760
what I'm doing here?

110
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:06,880
Spiritual Princess?

111
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:07,920
Um...

112
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:09,880
Spiritual Princess?

113
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:18,400
But I thought you had broken off

114
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,400
your engagement with Feng Wu.

115
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:25,320
Alright.

116
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,240
I shall declare once and for all

117
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:31,880
that I haven't broken off
my engagement with Feng Wu.

118
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:35,880
She's still my fiancee.

119
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:52,960
Your Highness Jun.

120
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:56,600
You.

121
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:58,880
You.

122
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:01,920
Darn it, Feng Yiran.

123
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:02,880
Why didn't you tell us?

124
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,280
Did you do this to humiliate us?

125
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,320
No. No.

126
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,360
So Miss Wu

127
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,520
was the girl of the Feng family

128
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:10,520
betrothed to His Highness Jun.

129
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:11,280
You.

130
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,320
No, Mr. Bi.

131
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,040
Please let me explain.

132
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,480
It was a misunderstanding.
A misunderstanding.

133
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,320
It was a huge misunderstanding.

134
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:24,400
Your Highness Jun,

135
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:25,760
this is a busy street.

136
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,240
Let go of my hand, will you?

137
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:35,760
You. You.

138
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,680
Let go of me.

139
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:46,520
What's the matter?

140
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:47,910
Nothing.

141
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,200
What are you afraid of?

142
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,520
You're to blame.

143
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:54,840
You shouldn't have said that nonsense.

144
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,360
You've ruined my reputation.

145
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:57,760
Alright.

146
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,560
Go and marry Bi Youfu, then.

147
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:00,920
Let go of me.

148
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,240
I could marry him.

149
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,120
It's not a bad idea.

150
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,640
From what I saw,

151
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:08,840
he could make a doting husband.

152
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:09,600
No.

153
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:11,440
I won't allow it.

154
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:12,600
What right do you have to object to it?

155
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:12,960
I...

156
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:21,960
You still owe me.

157
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,160
I'll have to keep you with me
until you pay off your debt.

158
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:27,240
You.

159
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:29,520
What...

160
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,240
Drat. What a nuisance.

161
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:52,280
Young Master,

162
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:53,800
please stop pacing around.

163
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:54,680
You're giving me

164
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,280
a headache.

165
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:57,680
Didn't you agree to go back

166
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,160
to Darknight Court with me?

167
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,920
But I don't want to go back empty-handed.

168
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,440
Young Master,

169
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:05,640
what do you plan to do, then?

170
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,520
I can't get the Celestial Fruit,

171
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:08,680
but at least

172
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:12,240
I should have a showdown with Jun Linyuan.

173
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,280
Young Master,

174
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,600
I see what's going on.

175
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:18,000
You want to see Little Fairy, don't you?

176
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,040
Young Master,

177
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,440
this is not the right way to woo a girl.

178
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:23,800
You're not going to win her heart

179
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,040
if you rush towards her

180
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:26,480
without a clear plan in mind.

181
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:29,240
Why are you talking like a Casanova?

182
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,800
I'm old enough

183
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:32,960
to be more experienced

184
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:36,120
in this matter, to be sure.

185
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:37,920
Why don't you tell me

186
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:39,320
what I should do?

187
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:41,360
Young Master,

188
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,760
here's a word of advice.

189
00:10:58,920 --> 00:10:59,640
Your Majesty.

190
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:03,560
Did you deliver my message?

191
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:04,480
Your Majesty,

192
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:05,480
I did.

193
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,960
I delivered it
to the leader of Celestial Palace.

194
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,040
Good.

195
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,240
It seems

196
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,840
that we'd better summon the Crown Prince

197
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,680
to return immediately.

198
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:48,000
Bravo. Bravo. Goddess is awesome.

199
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:48,880
This way, please, Madam.

200
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,880
We haven't seen you for a while.

201
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,480
Please allow me to make an introduction.

202
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,240
That young lady came here a few days ago.

203
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:57,640
She volunteered to teach us after hearing

204
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,440
that we were studying
basic spells on our own.

205
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:00,760
She taught us attentively,

206
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,800
and we studied hard.

207
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:07,080
It's good to gear
your study to practical use.

208
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:10,280
I hope this will help you
at the critical moment.

209
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:11,920
Now practice it with me, guys.

210
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,840
Yes, Ma'am.

211
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:22,760
It's wonderful to learn from such a selfless

212
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,440
and patient cultivator.

213
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:25,280
Yes, Madam.

214
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,960
The footwork you'd taught us helped me escape

215
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,800
the attack of some mountain
demonic beasts the other day.

216
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,280
I'm glad to hear that.

217
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:31,960
I'll send people to drive

218
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:33,920
the demonic beasts out of the suburbs.

219
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:34,960
Then you'll be able

220
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,880
to go hunting in the mountains
with an easy mind.

221
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,200
Thank you, Madam.

222
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,400
We're so grateful
to goodhearted ladies like you

223
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,880
and kind girls like her.

224
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:45,360
Cultivators are often too self-important

225
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:47,520
to care about the livelihood of us commoners.

226
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:50,920
Miss.

227
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,000
My name is Zuo Qingluan.

228
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:03,720
What an honor it is to meet

229
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,080
with a like-minded senior today.

230
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,240
Youngsters

231
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:08,760
with such a disposition

232
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,040
are hard to find nowadays.

233
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,560
It's a pleasure

234
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:13,040
to meet you.

235
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:34,960
What's the matter?

236
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:37,200
My family were attacked by demonic beasts

237
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:38,840
and got poisoned by snake venom.

238
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,800
I'm the only survivor.

239
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,520
Do you want to avenge them?

240
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:43,400
Yes.

241
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,920
But a pauper like me

242
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,560
isn't qualified to be a cultivator.

243
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,520
The rules are set by the winner.

244
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:56,520
Think if you don't know
how to cultivate yourself.

245
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:59,920
Study on your own
if you can't find a teacher.

246
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:01,880
What have you got to lose

247
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:04,720
by trying your best?

248
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,480
I can teach you

249
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:09,800
if you want to learn.

250
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,320
Your Majesty,

251
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:18,600
His Majesty is waiting for you in the Hall.

252
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,560
Her Majesty? Her Majesty?

253
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:21,880
I see.

254
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:23,240
That's Her Majesty?

255
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:28,920
Lassie,

256
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,160
you know who I am now.

257
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:33,240
It was a pleasure

258
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,720
meeting you today.

259
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,480
Come and visit me

260
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,280
at Junwu Divine Hall someday.

261
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:40,120
Yes, Your Majesty.

262
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:41,960
I'm flattered by Your Majesty's attention.

263
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:45,720
Let's go.

264
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:46,280
Yes, Your Majesty.

265
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,080
That really is Her Majesty!

266
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:00,960
She taught us spell herself

267
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:02,680
and often gave us medicinal herbs.

268
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:04,280
Her Majesty is so kind.

269
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,080
My Lady,

270
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:24,280
could you show me your spirit energy?

271
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,240
No way.

272
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,560
I have only a small amount of it every day.

273
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,080
I can't afford to squander it.

274
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,440
When do you plan to use it, then?

275
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:34,720
Perhaps

276
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:36,240
we should light a candle with it tonight?

277
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:39,120
No.

278
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:40,920
Don't waste it like that.

279
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:42,920
At least...

280
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:45,720
At least we should use it
to make Phoenix Tea.

281
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:48,120
It may produce a better flavor.

282
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:52,400
Feng Wu!

283
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,840
Oh, dear. Here she comes again.

284
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:57,040
Qiu Ling,

285
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,440
perhaps you should go ahead.

286
00:15:58,560 --> 00:15:59,600
I'll join you in the kitchen in a minute.

287
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,000
Look what you did.

288
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:07,040
Lord Bi gave my brother a talking-to.

289
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:08,480
That's not my fault.

290
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:09,960
You should blame Jun Linyuan.

291
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,440
I just played along.

292
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,520
Are you flaunting

293
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:14,560
how His Highness Jun
acknowledged you in public?

294
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:15,800
Don't kid yourself.

295
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,960
His recognition alone isn't enough.

296
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:20,200
You need His Majesty's
and Her Majesty's recognition as well.

297
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:29,400
Put down your sword if you dare.

298
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:31,080
Let's...let's duke it out.

299
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:43,320
You...

300
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,320
Do you take me for a fool?

301
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,840
The rules are always set by the strong.

302
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:53,440
Boss Jun,

303
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:55,440
do you suppose we could

304
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:56,960
make that snack with litchis?

305
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,440
You should ask her.

306
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:02,400
Tell me the truth.

307
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:04,160
Do you like His Highness Jun or not?

308
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:07,560
That's none of your business.

309
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:08,720
Feng Liu,

310
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:09,840
are you

311
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,310
in your right mind?

312
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:12,720
Besides,

313
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,040
marriage isn't the only thing

314
00:17:14,110 --> 00:17:15,720
a girl should concern herself with.

315
00:17:16,070 --> 00:17:17,200
You girls like him,

316
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,720
but I'm not one of you.

317
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:21,830
Jun Linyuan isn't Tang Monk's flesh.

318
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:38,840
His Highness Jun.

319
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,480
You said that.

320
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:44,120
I didn't force you to say that.

321
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:47,480
Did you say you don't like His Highness Jun?

322
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:48,720
Yes, yes.

323
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,000
Say another word,

324
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:52,560
and you'll part with not just a lock of hair.

325
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:57,200
Just you wait.

326
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:02,920
What a nuisance.

327
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,640
Now that I can finally cultivate myself,

328
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:07,240
I'll do everything to revive my master.

329
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:10,280
Your Highness Jun,

330
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:12,360
you're jilted.

331
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,760
Does it mean I've got a chance now?

332
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:22,200
And what the heck is Tang Monk's meat?

333
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:23,560
Is it very tasty?

334
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:26,760
I'm bored.

335
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,760
It's getting cold.

336
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,160
Is a storm coming?

337
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:45,440
Qiu Ling.

338
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,160
Young Master Feng. Your Highness Jun.

339
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:51,080
What is Tang Monk's flesh? Is it tasty?

340
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:52,680
Tang Monk's flesh?

341
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:53,880
According to Feng Wu,

342
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:55,800
Boss Jun isn't Tang Monk's flesh.

343
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:56,960
What does that mean?

344
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,920
She does talk about

345
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,320
strange stuff sometimes.

346
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:03,200
I don't know.

347
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:04,160
Listen.

348
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:05,560
There're many talents

349
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:06,800
in Qianyuan Continent.

350
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:08,600
Why don't you try persuading Feng Wu

351
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,520
to be my cook?

352
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:12,000
You should come along.

353
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:14,520
You'll always be welcome

354
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:15,920
and protected at our Penglai Pavilion.

355
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:17,640
Well...

356
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,360
I doubt my lady will accept the offer.

357
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:21,680
You mean Feng Wu

358
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,880
won't condescend to be a cook in my house?

359
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:24,760
That's not what I mean.

360
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:26,720
Do you expect Feng Wu

361
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:29,000
to become a remarkable cultivator?

362
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,240
That'd be a miracle.

363
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:31,520
No.

364
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:32,600
She has been working so hard;

365
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:33,760
perhaps she will become

366
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:34,560
a Great Spiritual Master,

367
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,080
Spiritual Elder
or Spiritual Immortal one day.

368
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:37,960
You must be kidding me.

369
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:39,560
A Great Spiritual Immortal?

370
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:42,200
Mu Jiuzhou has been
the only one in 100 years.

371
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,200
Perhaps

372
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:45,040
you should advise your lady to consider

373
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:47,560
becoming Boss Jun's Spiritual Princess.

374
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,120
It'll be a great...

375
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:55,480
Feng Wu cares nothing

376
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:57,400
about becoming
the Spiritual Princess of Junwu Clan.

377
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:58,920
It's none of your business.

378
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:01,000
Why did you come uninvited again?

379
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:03,800
Where's my Little Fairy?

380
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,560
She doesn't want to see you now, I'm afraid.

381
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,120
Please tell her

382
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:11,000
she's as gorgeous as always.

383
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:12,720
Her beauty

384
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,520
puts flowers to shame.

385
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,520
The flowers look nice.

386
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:28,360
I think she will use it as medicine.

387
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,440
Bitter and sweet, they're effective
in improving eyesight and calm the liver.

388
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:32,600
Excellent.

389
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:33,840
As medicine?

390
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:35,600
They're a gift for Little Fairy.

391
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:38,240
What a violent thug.

392
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,440
A violent thug is better than a fan-waving

393
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,560
smart mouth.

394
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:44,440
What did you just say?

395
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:45,280
Knock it off.

396
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:46,560
Stop fighting

397
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:47,600
in our place.

398
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,120
Young Lady will kick you guys out

399
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:51,160
if she hears this ruckus.

400
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:52,880
Qiu Ling,

401
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,280
let's go and prepare the food.

402
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:56,800
That's an instruction
from Sister Feng Wu herself.

403
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:57,560
Come on.

404
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:06,840
Come on.

405
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:09,520
Jun Linyuan,

406
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:11,200
so we've taken a fancy

407
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,080
to the same object again.

408
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,080
Don't kid yourself.

409
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,400
You're not my equal either in kung fu

410
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:17,880
or in any other aspect.

411
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,320
Don't be so sure.

412
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,880
Anyway, she's destined

413
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:34,480
to be mine in this life.

414
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,720
Get over yourself, Jun Linyuan.

415
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:42,520
If Lord Demon hadn't called me back,

416
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:44,920
I would show you

417
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:47,840
how I shall make Little Fairy my woman.

418
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,280
We've relaxed for far too long.

419
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:19,200
Your Highness Jun,

420
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:22,600
please don't get distracted
by this temporary peace

421
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,400
and forget your heavy responsibility.

422
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:28,160
Pack up.

423
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:30,880
We'll set out tomorrow.

424
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:42,360
Qiu Ling,

425
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:44,440
do keep this a secret.

426
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,360
I'll be so embarrassed

427
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,160
if the word is out that I, Young Master Feng,

428
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:50,280
was working as a cook here.

429
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:52,920
Young Master Feng,

430
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,880
shall we give up on it?

431
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,040
No way.

432
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:00,160
I still remember the superb flavor

433
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:01,760
of the Phoenix Tea made by Feng Wu last time.

434
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,040
Besides,

435
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:04,320
we'll soon return to the capital.

436
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:07,400
I wonder when I shall
get a taste of it again.

437
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:08,200
You're right.

438
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:10,680
You're going back to the capital.

439
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:24,520
Qiu Ling.

440
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,920
You don't want me to leave, do you?

441
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:31,680
I knew it.

442
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,480
I'm popular

443
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,960
with people of all age groups,

444
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:39,560
ranging from centenarians to toddlers.

445
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:41,680
Nonsense.

446
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,000
I'm not fond of you.

447
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:44,800
I feel sorry for Young Lady.

448
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:45,840
You mean Feng Wu?

449
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:47,600
She doesn't want me to leave, either?

450
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:48,760
I knew it.

451
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:51,200
Get over yourself.

452
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:53,200
She doesn't want His Highness Jun to leave.

453
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,760
You mean

454
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,040
Feng Wu already told you

455
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,440
she's in love with Boss Jun?

456
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:01,640
No.

457
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:03,840
It's just my guess.

458
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:08,560
What gave you the idea? Could you tell me?

459
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:10,320
Um,

460
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:13,040
every time Young Lady met His Highness Jun,

461
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,760
all she saw was His Highness.

462
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:16,840
Besides,

463
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:19,080
her eyes looked so bright

464
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:21,400
every time she was with His Highness Jun,

465
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:26,960
as if His Highness was all
she could see and think of.

466
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:28,920
She wore a bright smile on her face

467
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:32,200
every time they were together.

468
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:33,960
They say

469
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:35,800
when you're in love with someone,

470
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:37,000
you'll just...

471
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:39,680
You'll just...

472
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:42,800
So

473
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:46,440
she's not going to be my cook after all.

474
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:54,460
(Simple and Incorruptible)

475
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:55,680
What are you doing here?

476
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:57,720
Admiring the moon.

477
00:24:58,480 --> 00:24:59,760
Admiring the moon?

478
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:01,560
Um...

479
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:06,160
The moon has gone down.

480
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:10,480
I'll leave you to it, then.

481
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:11,600
Bye.

482
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:13,760
What do you think of the capital?

483
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,160
A small place could also be

484
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:19,800
infested with thugs and demons.

485
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:21,920
I assume you don't want to go there?

486
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:25,440
Why would I go there?

487
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:26,440
OK.

488
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,240
I get it.

489
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:35,800
That was weird.

490
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:38,600
What was he talking about?

491
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,080
You're giving me the cold shoulder?

492
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:54,600
What do you think?

493
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:56,160
Should I be staying here

494
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:57,160
and admiring the moon with you

495
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:58,400
in the middle of the night

496
00:25:58,560 --> 00:25:59,800
like I'm your bestie?

497
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,160
Wait.

498
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:05,160
Since His Highness Jun
liked your Phoenix Tea so much,

499
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:06,720
I tried my hands at making it, too.

500
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,280
I don't know if I got the flavor right.

501
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:09,920
Could you try it for me?

502
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:12,360
Are you out of your mind?

503
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:15,160
Didn't you try to eat me alive this morning?

504
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,400
We grew up together,

505
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:20,000
and yet I've never been your equal.

506
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:21,880
Your name is widely known.

507
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:25,560
Everyone calls you a beauty
with unparalleled talent.

508
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:28,360
Nobody knows that I'm a lady
of the Feng family, too.

509
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,920
I want to be
in the Crown Prince's good graces

510
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:33,160
and make my parents proud.

511
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:35,680
Please help me out this once.

512
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:38,400
Alright.

513
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:48,440
Your tea tastes horrible.

514
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:49,880
You need to practice more.

515
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,240
Ask Qiu Ling for help if you like.

516
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:54,080
I need to rinse my mouth.

517
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:19,800
Jun Linyuan,

518
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:26,760
let's get drunk tonight.

519
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:27,360
Come here.

520
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:40,920
I don't know what happened.

521
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:44,360
He kept fidgeting when he came back,

522
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:46,160
muttering

523
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:49,400
that love is a torment.

524
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:50,880
I guess

525
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:53,120
some young lady has broken his heart.

526
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:58,400
How come

527
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:00,320
a handsome gentleman

528
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:02,040
like me,

529
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:04,880
the man of numerous girls' dreams,

530
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:08,600
has failed to win her heart?

531
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:13,800
Why does she have to fall for you?

532
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:17,800
Why am I the one who gets jilted?

533
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:22,160
He's in a drunken fit.

534
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:23,400
Leave him be.

535
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:32,360
You're not bad.

536
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:34,000
You'll get your chance.

537
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:34,960
Yeah?

538
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:36,600
You mean

539
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:40,240
Feng Wu will change her mind

540
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:41,840
and choose me over you,

541
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:43,640
right?

542
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:44,600
Feng Wu?

543
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:47,680
Feng Wu.

544
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:50,040
I've always found her a pretty girl.

545
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:51,960
Now that we've grown up,

546
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:53,840
I still find her agreeable.

547
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:56,640
How come this interesting girl

548
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:58,400
who knows

549
00:28:58,560 --> 00:28:59,680
how to cure the sick

550
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:02,360
and how to cook

551
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:04,960
has to fall for you,

552
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:06,080
Jun Linyuan?

553
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:09,280
She'll become your wife,

554
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,240
and she won't be able to keep me company

555
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:13,480
or cook for me.

556
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:16,360
Did she tell you she's in love with me?

557
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:22,080
Qiu Ling is the one closest to her.

558
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:24,880
What she said must be true.

559
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:29,440
Boss Jun,

560
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:31,000
stop smirking.

561
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:32,720
Feng Xun is as drunk as a skunk.

562
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:34,040
Please stop him.

563
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:35,960
Why would I stop him?

564
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:38,360
I'm in a good mood.

565
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:40,800
I could use a drink, too.

566
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:47,320
We could also use a drink in a bad mood.

567
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:49,040
Come on, Feng Xun.

568
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:49,640
I'll drink with you.

569
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:50,160
Cheers.

570
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:03,760
Xuan Yi, come and join us,

571
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:06,080
although you are just

572
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:07,680
a silly bookworm

573
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:10,000
who loves nothing but books

574
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:14,600
and knows little about the torment of love.

575
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:00,520
Have I got food poisoning

576
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,200
from the horrible tea

577
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:04,320
Feng Liu made?

578
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:12,200
No.

579
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:14,120
I need to lie down for a while.

580
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:31,120
Feng Xun,

581
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:32,760
haven't you heard

582
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:38,240
that there are houses of gold

583
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:46,320
and gorgeous women in books?

584
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:53,800
What can I say?

585
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:56,840
I told you to read more books years ago,

586
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:57,920
but you wouldn't listen.

587
00:31:58,640 --> 00:31:59,880
If you were well-read,

588
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:02,680
you wouldn't have been despised by the girls.

589
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:03,240
Do you know?

590
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:08,160
It's OK.

591
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,360
I'll help you.

592
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:12,520
I'll help you

593
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:14,680
get a better girl.

594
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:16,080
You don't understand.

595
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:19,720
There aren't any better girls.

596
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:23,320
Prettier girls

597
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:26,800
can't cure the sick.

598
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:29,000
Girls more skilled in the art of healing

599
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:31,040
aren't as interesting as she is.

600
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:32,520
Girls who are more interesting

601
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:34,200
don't know how to make Phoenix Tea.

602
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:38,200
But she has to be in love with Jun Linyuan.

603
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:42,520
How could I steal Boss Jun's fiancee?

604
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:45,200
I'd never do that to my good buddy.

605
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:00,920
What is it?

606
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:10,320
Be careful.

607
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:25,000
Feng Wu.

608
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:27,440
Bi Youfu!

609
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:28,160
Be quiet.

610
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:28,720
What are you doing here?

611
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:29,520
Keep your voice down.

612
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:31,040
What do you think I'm doing here?

613
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:33,720
Don't touch me.

614
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:35,840
Don't... Don't kick me in the chin.

615
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:40,520
Don't come any closer.

616
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:42,320
Don't kick me in the chin.

617
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:44,800
Would you stop doing this?

618
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:47,680
Feng Wu.

619
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:52,480
Jun Linyuan.

620
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:57,560
Feng Xun has done so much for you.

621
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:00,480
You've got to marry Feng Wu

622
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:03,080
as soon as possible.

623
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:06,440
Don't let Feng Xun down, OK?

624
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:07,640
That's right.

625
00:34:16,150 --> 00:34:16,600
OK.

626
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:21,280
I'm off to propose to her.

627
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:25,190
Be a man and do it right now.

628
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:26,440
Do it.

629
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:28,840
Do it.

630
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:35,480
Bravo.

631
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:37,560
Set an example for us.

632
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:38,440
Set an example.

633
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:42,440
We'll be waiting for your return.

634
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:43,630
Your return.

635
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:51,840
Xuan Yi.

636
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:59,360
You have to choke me, huh?

637
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:09,000
Feng... Feng Wu. You...

638
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:12,600
Feng Wu.

639
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:14,200
Couldn't you spare my face?

640
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,400
Be gentle with me, OK?

641
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:21,800
Who is it?

642
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:43,440
Since you've got a visitor now,

643
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:45,360
I'll come back for a drink another day.

644
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:46,280
Get lost!

645
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:55,440
Bye.

646
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:14,560
What do you want?

647
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:18,320
It's me.

648
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:37,960
Forget all the unpleasant things.

649
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:40,280
Tomorrow is another day.

650
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:45,200
You'll still be that fearless Feng Wu.

651
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:49,320
All your troubles

652
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,040
will disappear.

653
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:53,240
Don't be afraid.

654
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:00,120
I'll take care of you.

655
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:15,160
We were destitute

656
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:17,680
when I first came here.

657
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:21,560
Mom and Qiu Ling

658
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,280
needed my attention.

659
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,440
You're the only one

660
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:29,880
who tells me, "Don't be afraid.

661
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:32,840
I'll take care of you."

662
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:48,200
You've fallen asleep?

663
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:31,040
I'm sorry about this.

664
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:32,680
I will marry you as soon as possible.

665
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:34,960
I won't treat you shabbily in every aspect.
