2
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:40,660
(Episode 3)

3
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:49,800
Xiaowu!

4
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,200
Why did you push me?

5
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,400
I...

6
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,360
You framed me.

7
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,280
How can you fall on the flat ground.

8
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:04,200
At least find a stone to frame me.

9
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:05,920
What a bitch.

10
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,800
I will teach you a lesson.

11
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,200
I'm sorry.

12
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,040
I happen to know

13
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,520
how to treat injures.

14
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:14,480
Let me rub your ankle.

15
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:19,800
Does it hurt?

16
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:20,960
That's okay.

17
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,280
It means my treatment is effective.

18
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,280
Please hold it.

19
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:30,160
You!

20
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,880
Done. Get up.

21
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,720
Come on. Get up.

22
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:34,600
Try to walk.

23
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,080
Don't touch me.

24
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,160
Don't leave.

25
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,240
If it still hurts,

26
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,520
I will rub you again.

27
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,640
I'm always ready to help people.

28
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,400
She should have stuck to her act.

29
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,600
Mu Yao's acting has room for improvement.

30
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,040
What about you?

31
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,160
Me? What about me?

32
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,000
What are you doing?

33
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,080
So you really don't have spirit energy.

34
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,560
But if you play tricks

35
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:14,920
in front of me again,

36
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,640
I won't stand by.

37
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,640
She framed me first.

38
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:21,960
If you act willfully again,

39
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,440
I will leave you here.

40
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,880
What? Leave me here?

41
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:30,720
Wait.

42
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:33,520
What do you want?

43
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,880
Bind up your wound.

44
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,360
My pride doesn't matter now.

45
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,400
I should fawn on him.

46
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:12,680
This is

47
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,240
the Loveless Insect Venom.

48
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,280
What are you doing?

49
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,760
Xiaowu, are you okay?

50
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,920
Boss Jun, what happened to you?

51
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,000
I'm fine.

52
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,200
Keep that girl away from me.

53
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,160
Don't let her come near me.

54
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,760
Xiaowu, don't mind him.

55
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,040
Boss Jun is always like this.

56
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,240
Ugly or not, he treats women the same.

57
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,960
It's not because you are very ugly.

58
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,600
I would rather not

59
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,720
be comforted by you.

60
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,680
I'm just lightening up the mood.

61
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,200
I will go out and have a look.

62
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:45,800
You should have some rest.

63
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:46,920
We will start traveling tomorrow morning.

64
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,240
Sit down.

65
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:52,600
Sit down.

66
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,440
Kid, the venom in your body

67
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,000
can't be treated by medicine.

68
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,100
Every time you experience a feeling of affection,

69
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,160
(Reverend Ziyang, Penglai Pavilion)
your heart will ache badly,

70
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,560
forcing you to speak falsely.

71
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,400
You should come with me to Penglai.

72
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,120
Penglai Pavilion's cultivation method

73
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,280
will pacify your mind

74
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,680
and suppress your feelings.

75
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:35,720
But you will need the tears of someone

76
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,640
who would love you and risk her life for you

77
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,040
to remove the venom.

78
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,280
Fate has made arrangements for everything.

79
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:45,200
Your opportunity will come to you eventually.

80
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:50,440
I have feelings for that girl?

81
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,200
No way.

82
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:55,720
The pain must have been caused

83
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,360
by the fact that I'm in the Frozen Forest.

84
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,520
Feng Xun, what are you doing here?

85
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:20,320
How come everyone likes Boss Jun?

86
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,240
Even you like him.

87
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,440
Don't I treat you well enough?

88
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,600
I don't like him.

89
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,720
You were ogling each other.

90
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,120
Don't assume I didn't see it.

91
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,920
I wasn't ogling him.

92
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,200
It has always been the case.

93
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,320
All the girls

94
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,840
like Boss Jun.

95
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,360
My elders

96
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,120
told me to learn from him.

97
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,760
From time to time, Xuan Yi

98
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,560
won our teacher's praises.

99
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,120
And I

100
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,280
have got nothing.

101
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,960
Don't say that.

102
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:57,360
Everyone has their own strong suit.

103
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,080
Look at you.

104
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,720
You are cheerful and easygoing.

105
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,320
You are better than the other two guys.

106
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:03,520
You are right.

107
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,960
I have always had the most friends.

108
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,360
If you don't believe me, you can ask them

109
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:08,640
whether they have friends

110
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:09,960
other than me.

111
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,520
That's right.

112
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:12,680
Look at me.

113
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,520
If not for my ugly face

114
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:16,120
and lack of the desire to get married,

115
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,520
I would marry you.

116
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:21,000
I would never choose Jun Linyuan the deadpan

117
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,240
or Xuan Yi the guy with lifeless eyes.

118
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,360
I know Xuan Yi's eyes appear lifeless.

119
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,480
But Xuan Yi is not always like that.

120
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,920
A deadpan.

121
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,400
This word describes Jun Linyuan accurately.

122
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,640
That's right.

123
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:34,160
There is an idiom for this.

124
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,240
Wearing a funeral face as if he...

125
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,680
Don't say that.

126
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,320
It's disrespectful to the Holy Sovereign.

127
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:42,800
Besides,

128
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,720
Boss Jun lost his mother in his childhood.

129
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:51,880
Xiaowu, I'm sleepy.

130
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,400
Let's get inside and sleep.

131
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,120
You can go to sleep.

132
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,120
I will sit here for a while.

133
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:11,060
The Heaven Slaying Sword.

134
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:14,080
Did Jun Linyuan leave for the Celestial Fruit?

135
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:24,760
Wait.

136
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:26,560
The Heaven Slaying Sword.

137
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:32,120
I guess someone ran into the Firecloud Giant Hawk.

138
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:33,360
Go after it.

139
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:36,400
Young Master.

140
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:37,960
Young Master, are you okay?

141
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,080
I probably got injured during the fight.

142
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:41,030
I'm fine.

143
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,320
First Elder, get going.

144
00:08:42,670 --> 00:08:43,400
Yes.

145
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:44,720
Come on.

146
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,000
Jun Linyuan,

147
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,960
here you come.

148
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:56,560
Show yourself!

149
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:07,160
Jun Linyuan, what did you make me swallow?

150
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:10,880
Penglai's special Tipsy Immortal Cloud Pill.

151
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,480
Don't worry. You will be fine.

152
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:14,560
You just can't use your spirit energy

153
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:15,920
within 12 hours.

154
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,040
Why don't you believe me?

155
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,840
You enjoy the same level of fame as me.

156
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,600
How dare you play such a dirty trick?

157
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:26,240
I just gave you

158
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:28,280
a taste of your own medicine.

159
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:31,600
I'm telling you,

160
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,240
the Celestial Fruit

161
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,040
will be mine.

162
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:36,720
Don't even think about taking it.

163
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:38,320
Jun Linyuan,

164
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,880
I will defeat you,

165
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,880
reveal your true colors,

166
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,560
and show the world who the most powerful cultivator is.

167
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,200
You black-hearted and malevolent jerk.

168
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,440
You are noisy.

169
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,520
Jun Linyuan, put me down!

170
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:56,400
Jun Linyuan!

171
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,160
Put me down!

172
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,160
Stop yelling.

173
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,000
Put me down!

174
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,680
Be good and stay here.

175
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,640
Wait until your subordinates come back for you.

176
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,480
Put me down!

177
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:35,880
Strange.

178
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,640
I don't see the Firecloud Giant Hawk.

179
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,840
How come Young Master hasn't caught up with us?

180
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:44,880
First Elder,

181
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,560
should we return?

182
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:57,680
Let's go.

183
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,320
What is this? What is going on?

184
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:04,360
Crap. The evil spirits are here.

185
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,440
Where is Jun Linyuan?

186
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,680
Why is a man hanging in the air?

187
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:33,520
No.

188
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:36,640
It's a great deed to save a life.

189
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,360
What if the Firecloud Giant Hawk

190
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:41,360
comes here and eats him?

191
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:47,920
I might as well do a good deed to improve my luck.

192
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:21,880
What is this scent?

193
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:22,960
Who are you?

194
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,360
Little Fairy.

195
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:12,400
Feng Xun, what is that thing on your face?

196
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:17,280
Xuan Yi, what's wrong with my face?

197
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,160
Don't make a fuss.

198
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:21,120
It's a mosquito bite.

199
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:22,280
It will disappear in a few days.

200
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:23,840
Damn it.

201
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,600
The Celestial Fruit
lies in the Firecloud Cave.

202
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,160
Boss Jun, how do you know?

203
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:30,080
Last night,

204
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:32,000
I ran into Yu Mingye.

205
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:33,120
Has Yu Mingye

206
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,760
arrived at the Firecloud Cave?

207
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:36,120
No.

208
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:37,520
Come on.

209
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,720
We must hurry up.

210
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:40,600
What if he beats us to the Celestial Fruit?

211
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:41,280
No way.

212
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:42,920
He is Yu Mingye,

213
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:44,160
the Young Master of the Darknight Court.

214
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,840
He is particularly hard to tackle.

215
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:47,880
What do you mean?

216
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,200
Yu Mingye

217
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:51,560
is the only Great Spiritual Master

218
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,680
who enjoys the same level
of fame as Boss Jun.

219
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:56,440
The two of them
have been rivals since childhood.

220
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:58,320
They compete fiercely whenever they meet.

221
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,840
Who is stronger, he or you or Xuan Yi?

222
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:01,760
Of course...

223
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:07,280
He is slightly stronger.

224
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,480
But that's not the point.

225
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,880
The point is he is wicked

226
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:11,600
and he plays dirty.

227
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,240
He doesn't deserve to be called a cultivator.

228
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:14,440
What's most annoying about him

229
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:15,720
is that he always meddles

230
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:17,480
in Boss Jun's business.

231
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:18,480
Isn't he annoying?

232
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,920
But when Boss Jun is around,

233
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,280
he always blunders.

234
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:26,440
Anyway, if you see Yu Mingye,

235
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:27,720
you must run.

236
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:28,800
Why?

237
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:31,320
With a pair of enchanting eyes,

238
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,120
he has made numerous damsels his victims.

239
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:34,960
For safety's sake,

240
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:36,640
you must run if you ever see him.

241
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:37,600
Understand?

242
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:40,960
Alright. Enough talking.

243
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:41,760
Let's get going.

244
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:38,160
Something bad must have happened
to cause this unusual situation.

245
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:39,440
Be careful.

246
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:40,720
They are evil spirits.

247
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:52,400
The number of evil spirits

248
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,120
is significant.

249
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,320
No need to fear them.

250
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:56,560
No matter how many evil spirits attack us,

251
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:58,160
we will slay them.

252
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:01,200
Where is Xiaowu?

253
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:07,600
Watch me slay them!

254
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:31,920
Feng Xun.

255
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:34,240
Xuan Yi.

256
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,400
Xuan Yi, where is Boss Jun?

257
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:38,640
I haven't seen him.

258
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:40,320
Let's look for him there.

259
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,680
What should I do? What should I do?

260
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,800
This is so embarrassing.

261
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:58,160
It's an accident.

262
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,160
It's not a big deal.

263
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:02,720
I won't take responsibility anyway.

264
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:11,320
Hey.

265
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:14,280
Maybe we should talk to each other.

266
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:17,600
This place feels kind of scary
when we are silent.

267
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:19,360
Just talk.

268
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:22,600
Why are you bent on
getting the Celestial Fruit?

269
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:23,880
Considering how strong
your cultivation is,

270
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:25,600
you don't need it
to increase your spirit energy.

271
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:28,240
You aren't going after it for yourself.

272
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:29,440
For whom

273
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,880
are you risking your life
to obtain the Celestial Fruit?

274
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:35,960
Someone who can...

275
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,880
-Someone who can order the Crown Prince.
-You talk too much.

276
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:45,280
I heard the Holy Sovereign
is enthusiastic about cultivation,

277
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:46,520
so enthusiastic that
he has become obsessed...

278
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:49,240
And it's getting serious.

279
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,200
I heard from Feng Xun

280
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,200
that you had stayed in
Penglai Pavilion for many years

281
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,120
and you returned to
the Capital three years ago.

282
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:57,200
How have you been in the past three years?

283
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,200
I have been well.

284
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:00,840
I don't need you to worry about me.

285
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:01,840
If you were being well,

286
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:02,800
then you wouldn't be forced

287
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,280
to do something you were unwilling to do.

288
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,360
If you don't bring back the Celestial Fruit,

289
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,360
the Holy Sovereign
won't be happy with you, right?

290
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:18,840
As I expected, the Celestial Fruit

291
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,720
matters a lot to him.

292
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:24,240
He saved me a few times, after all.

293
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:27,760
I shouldn't repay his kindness with enmity.

294
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:34,720
Are you alright?

295
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:36,320
I'm fine.

296
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:41,720
I just didn't expect

297
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:46,000
a little girl like you to pity me.

298
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:50,680
No matter how tough a man looks,

299
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,160
he must have a soft and vulnerable side.

300
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,480
Why are you so concerned

301
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,320
about the Celestial Fruit?

302
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,360
You are a mortal.

303
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:07,680
The Celestial Fruit
can't increase your spirit energy.

304
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:08,840
Who says it can't?

305
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,080
I'm just curious.

306
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:16,200
So I asked some questions.

307
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:17,520
Besides,

308
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,640
why can't a mortal take an interest

309
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:20,880
in the Celestial Fruit?

310
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:31,200
-Your Highness Jun!
-Xiaowu!

311
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:35,040
-Feng Xiaowu, where are you?
-Your Highness Jun!

312
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:36,640
Your Highness Jun!

313
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,600
Feng Xiaowu, are you there?

314
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,320
Your Highness Jun!

315
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:42,960
Xiaowu!

316
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:46,120
Xiaowu!

317
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:47,040
The fog is too thick.

318
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:49,160
We should find a place
to bed down for the night.

319
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:50,160
We can look for them

320
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,240
tomorrow after the fog dissipates.

321
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:52,360
That won't do.

322
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:53,520
Xiaowu is a girl

323
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:54,520
without a cultivation.

324
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,480
If she spends the night in the wilderness,

325
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:57,680
something bad is bound to happen to her.

326
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,120
Xiaowu!

327
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:02,600
Xiaowu!

328
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:05,720
Surely, that ugly girl

329
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:07,680
is planning to seduce His Highness Jun.

330
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,240
If she succeeds,

331
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:11,800
what will I tell my Senior Sister?

332
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,640
Goddess Zuo,
you have finally arrived.

333
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,720
(Jingzhou)
The Hundred Poison Beast

334
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,000
has scourged Jingzhou for months.

335
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,040
As a result, the people
are panicking every day.

336
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:22,800
He's right. Now that Goddess Zuo is here,

337
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:23,920
we are

338
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:26,000
finally at ease.

339
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:29,360
Cultivators are obligated to protect people.

340
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,200
You don't have to praise me.

341
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:32,680
Your spirit energy is particularly strong.

342
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:34,640
Ordinary cultivators can't compare with you.

343
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:35,120
That's right.

344
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,480
A few days ago,

345
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:39,000
a female cultivator tried
to subdue the Hundred Poison Beast.

346
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,360
But she failed

347
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:41,920
and returned, looking battered.

348
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:45,120
She must be young and inexperienced.

349
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,400
Her cultivation was not strong enough
to sustain her tough act.

350
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,160
-I said it.
-Yeah.

351
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:52,240
Usually, cultivators are lithe and limber.

352
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:53,840
But that female cultivator

353
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:55,400
was clumsy as hell.

354
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:56,280
That's right.

355
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:58,280
Did she say which sect she was from?

356
00:23:58,440 --> 00:23:59,280
What did she look like?

357
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:01,240
She didn't tell us about her sect.

358
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:03,320
She was not tall. And she looked

359
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:04,760
quite comely.

360
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,240
But her body movement

361
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,800
was barely decent.

362
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:09,960
She probably came to swindle.

363
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,040
Fortunately,

364
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,040
she didn't do anything bad.

365
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:15,200
Zhao Ge, were you the female cultivator?

366
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:16,800
Do you know I'm worried about you?

367
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:32,040
The fog is too thick.

368
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:33,360
If we keep moving,

369
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:35,560
we will lose our way completely.

370
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:40,960
Let's bed down here for the night.

371
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:42,440
Wait until the fog dissipates.

372
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,880
The whole place is spooky.

373
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:59,880
How about you sing a song
to lighten up the mood?

374
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:01,720
Ridiculous.

375
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,680
I am a weak woman

376
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,160
and you are the reason

377
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:08,320
that I'm in the wilderness.

378
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:11,120
Now you even refused to sing a song.

379
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:14,440
No.

380
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:18,160
Just sing a song.

381
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:19,520
I won't criticize your singing voice.

382
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:20,360
Come on, sing.

383
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:21,720
I said no.

384
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:27,080
I'm just an ordinary girl.

385
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,760
I went to the tea house for entertainment.

386
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:31,320
But...

387
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:35,240
But... I never thought...

388
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,520
I never thought...

389
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:38,720
Enough. Stop talking.

390
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:40,760
I will sing a song.

391
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:04,800
Xiaowu!

392
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,800
-Xiaowu!
-Your Highness Jun!

393
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:12,640
Xiaowu!

394
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:14,160
Your Highness Jun!

395
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:15,160
Don't speak.

396
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:23,840
Xuan Yi.

397
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:26,560
I think I heard Boss Jun's voice.

398
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:29,040
There must be something wrong
with your hearing.

399
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:32,920
No, it's him.

400
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:35,000
This pleasant singing voice

401
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:36,600
only belongs to him.

402
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:40,440
This way.

403
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:47,760
Stop singing.

404
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:51,000
Miss.

405
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:53,320
A man and a woman should
keep a distance from each other.

406
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:54,720
Please behave yourself.

407
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,600
Your creepy singing voice

408
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:00,640
was going to lure the wolves here.

409
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:06,080
Let me take back what I just said.

410
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:08,120
The wolves aren't here.

411
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:09,720
But what are those things?

412
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:14,040
Charm Demons.

413
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:15,360
Charm...

414
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:21,000
I underestimated your singing voice.

415
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:22,840
This is terrifying.

416
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:25,120
Don't look them in the eye.

417
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:26,600
They will enchant you.

418
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:31,760
Where are they?

419
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:37,840
Be careful.

420
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:52,240
Jun Linyuan!

421
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:14,000
Run.

422
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:44,400
Jun Linyuan!

423
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:13,120
Why did the Firecloud Giant Hawk pop up?

424
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:15,480
Why did it fly into my spirit ring?

425
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:19,520
Boss Jun! Boss Jun!

426
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,880
Boss Jun! Boss Jun! Boss Jun!

427
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,000
-Your Highness Jun!
-Xiaowu!

428
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:27,080
Xiaowu, are you okay?

429
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:28,360
You are here.

430
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:29,560
What happened?

431
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:30,600
What happened to Boss Jun?

432
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:35,440
Nothing serious.

433
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:37,120
He was enchanted by a Charm Demon

434
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:38,240
and passed out.

435
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:42,520
Young Master.

436
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:49,080
You couldn't even defeat a few evil spirits.

437
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:51,480
If people know about this,

438
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:53,640
the Darknight Court's reputation
will be ruined.

439
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:58,880
I'm too old to deal with them.

440
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:01,200
But you are young and promising.

441
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:03,160
I merely defeated a few evil spirits.

442
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:05,080
If only Jun Linyuan

443
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,520
was so easy to defeat.

444
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:10,280
How dare he do that to me?

445
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:13,880
I swear I will get even with him.

446
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:16,600
Young Master, you ran into Jun Linyuan?

447
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:17,960
What exactly happened?

448
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:19,680
Nothing.

449
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:21,080
There is nothing to talk about.

450
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:23,240
Let's get going.

451
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,120
We must beat Jun Linyuan

452
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:26,520
to the Celestial Fruit.

453
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:27,880
Yes.

454
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:29,080
Here is water.

455
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:31,080
Let me hold it.

456
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:32,320
I can do it.

457
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:33,000
Let me hold it.

458
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:34,360
Alright. Let me hold it.

459
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:36,080
A tough battle will take place tomorrow.

460
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,240
Go have some rest.

461
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:10,720
Feng Wu.

462
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:12,640
Feng Wu.

463
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:15,920
Feng Wu.

464
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:29,860
(In the Dragon Phoenix Spirit Ring)

465
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:44,520
Master.

466
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:46,920
Master.

467
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,880
Why is your hand so cold?

468
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:50,080
Master.

469
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:52,440
Master. Master.

470
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:54,200
Don't waste your energy.

471
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:55,520
Who?

472
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:57,000
Who?

473
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,400
Here.

474
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:01,360
Three years ago, your Master used

475
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:04,080
his remaining half a drop
of Phoenix Blood to save you.

476
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:05,520
You survived.

477
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:06,920
But he lost consciousness.

478
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,080
You can't wake him up now.

479
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,600
Why is a little parrot here?

480
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:14,560
I'm not a little parrot.

481
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,000
I'm the Colored Phoenix.

482
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,120
The Colored Phoenix.

483
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:18,560
You...

484
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:20,840
You are the Firecloud Giant Hawk.

485
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:23,320
No. The Firecloud Giant Hawk is me.

486
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:26,480
How come you are a little bird now?

487
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:35,440
I'm Lord Mu's spirit animal.

488
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:37,400
Lord Mu turned me into
the Firecloud Giant Hawk

489
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:39,640
and asked me to guard the Celestial Fruit

490
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:41,480
before it ripened

491
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:42,320
and

492
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:43,720
wait for you to come.

493
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:45,320
Wait for me to come?

494
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:47,520
You haven't forgotten

495
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,640
why you need the Celestial Fruit, have you?

496
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:50,880
Master told me to use the Celestial Fruit

497
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:52,960
to make the Nine Transformation
Spirit Restoration Pill.

498
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:55,400
It's the only way to find out

499
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:56,760
what exactly happened to me.

500
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:58,440
Regaining the ability to cultivate
is the first step.

501
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:00,920
Our ultimate goal is to wake up your Master.

502
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:02,960
When Lord Mu resisted
the Heavenly Tribulation to ascend,

503
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,960
people thought he died.

504
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:07,840
But he is just sleeping in the spirit ring.

505
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:09,800
You haven't told anyone

506
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:11,120
that you met him, have you?

507
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:12,680
I have nobody to tell.

508
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,080
Then listen carefully.

509
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:15,880
The energy barrier has cracked.

510
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:17,760
Demonic beasts all over the world
are ready to make trouble.

511
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:18,960
There must be villains

512
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:21,000
seizing the chance
to disrupt order on the Continent.

513
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:23,880
Lord Mu is the most powerful cultivator
on Qianyuan Continent.

514
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:25,320
He knows everything.

515
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:27,480
We must find a way to wake him up

516
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:29,840
to resolve the crisis
that could occur anytime

517
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:32,480
and find the answer you are seeking.

518
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:33,480
Understand?

519
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:34,710
Yes.

520
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:36,920
Your top priority

521
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:39,150
is to obtain the Celestial Fruit.

522
00:34:39,190 --> 00:34:40,080
Don't worry.

523
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:42,040
Lord Mu gave me this task.

524
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:43,560
I will help you.

525
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:45,190
You are inside the Dragon Phoenix Spirit Ring

526
00:34:45,190 --> 00:34:47,400
and seeing a phantom of me.

527
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:49,320
You must obtain the Celestial Fruit

528
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:52,150
to remove the phantom created by Lord Mu.

529
00:34:52,150 --> 00:34:53,000
By then,

530
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:55,520
I will tell you what to do next.

531
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:56,320
Understand?

532
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:32,720
Are you okay?

533
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:34,720
I'm fine.

534
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:39,720
What are you doing?

535
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:40,520
I...

536
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:46,120
What is this?

537
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:49,000
It's a wish for victory.

538
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:50,280
It can make you smile.

539
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:53,120
You sewed it?

540
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:56,760
Ugly.

541
00:36:58,040 --> 00:36:59,200
It's not ugly.

542
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:00,600
You just can't appreciate art.

543
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:10,280
I hope this thing

544
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:11,880
won't bring me bad luck.

545
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:14,080
You take my goodwill for evil intent.

546
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:15,480
Damn.

547
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:44,160
Are you sure this is the place?

548
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:45,240
Yeah.

549
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:46,600
This cave looks

550
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:47,960
creepy.

551
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,320
This is the Firecloud Giant Hawk's feather.

552
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:03,960
The Celestial Fruit

553
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:06,080
should be inside.

554
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:10,360
Be careful when you enter the cave.

555
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:11,400
Don't disturb the Hawk.

556
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:12,840
Got it.

557
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,280
The Celestial Fruit

558
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:30,680
will be mine.

559
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,520
Take the food away.

560
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:10,280
My Madame, you should at least
try to have some food.

561
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:12,440
If Young Lady knows

562
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:14,040
you refused to eating anything,

563
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:15,800
she will feel bad.

564
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:22,240
Young Lady must be back.

565
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:36,740
(Feng's Mansion)

566
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:49,920
Young Master. Sixth Young Lady.

567
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:52,040
Why are you here?

568
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:54,920
Where is the useless Feng Wu?

569
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,000
What the hell is on the ground?

570
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:13,280
I wonder where the Celestial Fruit is.

571
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:15,320
How about we scatter and search?

572
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:21,160
You seem to care about
the Celestial Fruit very much.

573
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:24,280
Just follow us.

574
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:25,440
Don't cause trouble.

575
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,440
I grew up in a poor family.

576
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:29,920
I have never seen any treasure.

577
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:32,080
I wish to widen my horizons

578
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:34,240
and boast about this experience back home.

579
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:37,440
Colored Phoenix,

580
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:39,800
where on earth are you?

581
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:15,160
The Celestial Fruit.

582
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:18,480
Finally, we are in a bigger space.

583
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:38,400
Boss Jun,

584
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:40,920
