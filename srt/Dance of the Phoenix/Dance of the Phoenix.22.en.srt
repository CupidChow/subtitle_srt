2
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:40,380
(Episode 22)

3
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,520
It's Master.

4
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:00,800
This...

5
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,320
This is...

6
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,000
Old Man Wu.

7
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,480
The Deadly Vessel-rupturing Pill.

8
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,280
What is that?

9
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,560
It is a pill
that can improve one's spirit energy

10
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,800
by three times in a short time.

11
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,680
However, after its efficacy disappears,

12
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:02,920
the user will die of vessel rupture.

13
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:16,680
You are too silly.

14
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:54,560
Youdao,

15
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,480
if you don't come round,

16
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,240
nobody can save you.

17
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,120
Young Master.

18
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,080
Young Master, Lord Demon has ordered that

19
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,800
you should not get involved in this.

20
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,440
Youdao.

21
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,560
Stop it.

22
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,800
Stop hurting the innocent people.

23
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:02,480
Youdao.

24
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,920
Wake up! It is me.

25
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:27,920
Grandpa.

26
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,440
He has lost his self-consciousness.

27
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,360
We mustn't let him leave this place.

28
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,480
Xuan Yi, the energy barrier!

29
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,520
Hurry!

30
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,360
Where is this place?

31
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:12,000
It is the back mountain of Junwu Academy.

32
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:13,760
It is unexpected that this hidden passage

33
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,000
leads to this place.

34
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:03,440
A girl used to live here.

35
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,680
Could it be Sima Yunniang?

36
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:11,120
Back then, when the Library caught fire,

37
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,200
she wasn't burned to death.

38
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,640
Then she came here to live in seclusion.

39
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,080
Thus, Old Man Wu said just now that

40
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:18,920
after the big fire,
her dead body wasn't found.

41
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,520
But based on what we see now,

42
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,840
she must have left this place.

43
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,000
Could she have gone somewhere else?

44
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,120
Let's hurry to find her.

45
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:29,160
We may find some clues.

46
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:57,100
(Yun)

47
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,880
It is really Yunniang.

48
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,200
Just a moment.

49
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,680
This letter doesn't seem to be left to us.

50
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:09,920
Under such a circumstance,

51
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,080
why need you care about that?

52
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,840
To Youdao.

53
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,160
I can't hold on any longer.

54
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,520
Oh, that is not good!

55
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,400
Grandpa.

56
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,880
Though I think this academy isn't good,

57
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,640
Feng Wu likes it a lot.

58
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,240
She made great efforts
to be admitted to the academy.

59
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,040
If you destroy it like this,

60
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:06,040
she will feel sad.

61
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:12,560
Yu Mingye.

62
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:13,480
Yu Mingye.

63
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,200
Young Master.

64
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:25,840
Have I arrived too late?

65
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,040
Old Man Wu.

66
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:45,960
Your Highness.

67
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:52,640
Old Man Wu.

68
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:53,600
Stop it!

69
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,080
I have brought the letter that

70
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,440
Yunniang wrote to you.

71
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:18,680
He is not in his right mind now.

72
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:20,000
So it is very dangerous to get close to him.

73
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:25,600
Use the spirit energy

74
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:26,840
to send it up to him.

75
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:43,960
Since we parted in that year,

76
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,560
there has never been any news about you

77
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,160
and I have been missing you so much.

78
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,840
So I came to live here in seclusion

79
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,640
to avoid feeling depressed at what I see.

80
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,520
When I recall the past of the four of us,

81
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:55,520
I couldn't help lamenting our fates.

82
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,200
I hope that you won't
harbor bitter resentment

83
00:12:58,640 --> 00:12:59,920
and won't forget your original aspirations.

84
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:02,040
From Yunniang.

85
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:51,960
Old Man Wu.

86
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:12,760
-Yunniang didn't die back then.
-Yunniang

87
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:16,320
She has been waiting for you
in the back mountain.

88
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,520
She hoped that you could
free yourself from the past.

89
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:28,800
Yunniang.

90
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,400
Yunniang.

91
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,600
What a pity!

92
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,520
What a pity!

93
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:46,360
I have come to know this too late.

94
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,160
Over all those years,

95
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,720
I have been missing
the chances of seeing you.

96
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:53,400
I have missed all the chances.

97
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,800
I am afraid that I don't have any chance

98
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:58,560
to make amends

99
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,920
for what I did wrong.

100
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:02,000
Hang in there.

101
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:03,080
I can save you.

102
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,360
Feng Wu,

103
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,800
there isn't enough time.

104
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:11,600
I am dying.

105
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,280
I know the whereabouts

106
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,560
of the item you are looking for.

107
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,320
Come over.

108
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,680
Have you kept it in your mind?

109
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,200
Feng Wu.

110
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:41,400
If you...

111
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,760
inherit it,

112
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,000
I,

113
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,160
I will...

114
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:54,040
set my mind at rest.

115
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:02,120
Old Man Wu!

116
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:03,040
Supervisor Wu.

117
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,040
Wake up!

118
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,120
I have the drug.

119
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:08,600
Don't die!

120
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,120
I have the drug.

121
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,640
I can save you.

122
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,640
Wake up!

123
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:20,880
I can save you.

124
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:26,880
Old Man Wu,

125
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:31,320
wake up.

126
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:34,280
I can save you.

127
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:44,960
It is no use.

128
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:56,960
He is gone.

129
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,520
Old Man Ba.

130
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,200
You have great magic power,

131
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,120
hurry to save him.

132
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,640
This is his wish.

133
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:12,200
Just let him go in relief and peace.

134
00:17:14,350 --> 00:17:16,310
The three of them
will meet in the other world

135
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:19,200
and they won't be lonely any longer.

136
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,120
In the swapped life,

137
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:35,480
even if one does one's utmost,

138
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:39,640
the lost things can't be recovered.

139
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:46,760
Jun Linyuan.

140
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,480
I want to have a talk with you.

141
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:08,760
Feng Wu.

142
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:12,560
I am sorry.

143
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:16,960
Why did you say sorry to me?

144
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:26,080
Because actually, I am not Feng Wu.

145
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:33,200
Feng Wu.

146
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,000
Feng Wu.

147
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:39,560
Who are you?

148
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,480
You are awake, Feng Wu.

149
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,120
Who is Feng Wu? Where am I?

150
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:46,200
Where am I?

151
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:54,520
A voice in my mind keeps telling me that

152
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:57,080
I don't belong here.

153
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:00,560
In the end, I may still

154
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,520
go back to where I belong.

155
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,480
I know it is unacceptable to you.

156
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:09,720
But I don't know why

157
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,720
I have just come here inexplicably

158
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:14,920
and

159
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:17,840
fallen in love with you unfathomably.

160
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,880
I know this sounds complex.

161
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:25,520
It is normal for you
to be unable to accept it.

162
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:41,600
Actually, I also sensed that

163
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,760
you are not the same as you used to be.

164
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:51,960
I have been persuading myself that

165
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:54,600
your temperament
has changed greatly due to the injury.

166
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:58,800
But I couldn't lie to myself.

167
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:03,160
You are no longer the girl I used to know.

168
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,440
It is true that you don't belong here.

169
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:09,320
Then why did you...

170
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:10,480
I am happy.

171
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:15,280
I am happy that you told all this:

172
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:22,040
your worries,

173
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,280
your unease

174
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,320

175
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:32,040
I am willing to face
all these together with you.

176
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:35,160
What makes me happier is that

177
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,880
you said you had
fallen in love with me just now.

178

No.

246
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:12,120
The spirit energy
inside your body is scattered.

247
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:17,200
The main reason is that
your primordial Qi has been consumed.

248

The Primordial Qi to the spirit energy
as the sun is to the sunflower.

Without the sun,
sunflowers can only lower their heads.

It can concentrate your mind

the Qi will be condensed in your meridians.

Thus, your spirit energy will be subdued.

Come on, take a seat.

257
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:45,640
Thank you, Your Majesty.

258
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:49,200
It has been several years
since I met you last time.

259
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:52,800
It came as a surprise to me
that I saw you again today.

260
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:54,720
Since you have come,

261
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,480
why not stay

262
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:02,120
and take up teaching in Junwu Academy?

263
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:07,200
You flattered me, Your Majesty.

264
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:10,840
I can only make some medicinal pills

265
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,640
and is capable of nothing else.

266
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:15,840
I can't mislead the disciples here.

267
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,160
So, please hire someone better qualified,
Your Majesty.

268
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:22,800
I came to the capital this time

269
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,720
with the purpose of visiting my old friends.

270
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:27,080
However,

271
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,280
my old friends have passed away.

272
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:35,720
I will pay a visit
to my disappointing young friend

273
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:37,840
and then I will go back to the Border City.

274
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:42,160
I have never heard you have a young friend

275
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:43,560
in the capital, Doctor Ba.

276
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:47,480
Could I ask which young talent

277
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:49,720
has won your friendship?

278
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:51,200
There is no such a young talent.

279
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:53,720
My young friend is a girl.

280
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:57,400
She is Feng Wu,
the fifth daughter of the Feng Family.

281
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:02,480
She and I crossed paths
when we were in the Border City.

282
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:04,600
I gave her some medical guidance.

283
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:06,080
That's all.

284
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:11,120
If Your Majesty trust me,

285
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:15,040
when I leave to travel around later,

286
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:17,440
you can summon her into the palace

287
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,360
to help nurse your body.

288
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,760
On your birthday,

289
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:26,880
the girl who danced
the sword dance with Linyuan

290
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:28,680
is Feng Wu, right?

291
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:29,680
Yes.

292
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:31,000
Yes.

293
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:33,480
Good!

294
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:35,920
Really good!

295
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:39,760
She is young,
but is a senior-rank spiritual practitioner.

296
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:42,840
Surprisingly, she is also your
cross-generation friend.

297
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:45,880
She is good-looking

298
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:48,960
and quick-witted.

299
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:50,720
Doctor Ba.

300
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:53,960
Could you bring her
to the inner court some other day?

301
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:56,240
I will grant her an audience.

302
00:27:57,080 --> 00:28:00,160
If there is the chance, I will.

303
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:02,520
That is it.

304
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:05,400
Please allow me to excuse myself,
Your Majesty.

305
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:07,680
OK. Suit yourself, doctor.

306
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,800
Your Majesty, I am off.

307
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:11,440
OK.

308
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:17,160
Your Majesty,

309
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:19,880
why do you want

310
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,280
to meet Feng Wu?

311
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:24,520
On that day, I saw that she and Linyuan

312
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:26,200
performed a sword-dance in great harmony.

313
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:30,240
Considering that he is still not betrothed,

314
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:31,520
I came up with the idea...

315
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:39,240
Your Majesty, you have been
in poor health recently.

316
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:40,560
Let's just take our time

317
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:44,480
to discuss this matter later.

318
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,440
OK.

319
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:48,800
OK.

320
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:05,000
Do you mean that
Feng Wu is not her real self now?

321
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:07,040
How could this be possible?

322
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:08,120
Zhao Ge.

323
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:10,320
Why need I lie to you about such a matter?

324
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:12,480
I came to tell you
after I obtained the evidence.

325
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:15,040
Look!

326
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:16,840
If what I said is true,

327
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:18,080
you need to

328
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:19,840
stay away from her now

329
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:21,520
in case that she wants to hurt you.

330
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:22,440
No, she won't do that.

331
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:23,840
Wu is still Wu.

332
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:25,400
She is my good friend.

333
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:28,040
Whether in the past or at present,

334
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,520
she is always a sincere friend to me

335
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:30,600
and treats me nicely.

336
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:31,720
Senior Sister,

337
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:34,160
I don't understand why you said this.

338
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:36,720
I don't believe.

339
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:41,360
Senior Sister.

340
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:43,360
I know you have issues with Feng Wu.

341
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:44,680
She took your place

342
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:47,160
and performed with His Highness Jun
at the birthday feast of Her Majesty.

343
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:48,600
But you shouldn't have said this.

344
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:50,040
It is not proper for you to say this.

345
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:02,040
Feng Wu.

346
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:04,240
I just can't resign myself to such an end.

347
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:08,120
I will make you lose everything.

348
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:21,960
Old guys.

349
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:27,100
I came to visit you.

350
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:29,140
(Wu Youdao's Tomb)

351
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,960
I envy you a lot.

352
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:34,800
After death,

353
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:38,280
you are all buried in the same place.

354
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:45,080
I will go join you some day.

355
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:48,680
You couldn't pretend not to know me.

356
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,200
Old Man Ba.

357
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:51,760
Don't be like this.

358
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:55,360
When people are old,

359
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:57,720
they tend to think a lot about old friends.

360
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:01,800
It is a pity that in the end,

361
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:03,520
Yunniang's dead body wasn't found.

362
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:07,040
I can only bury her clothes here

363
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:08,280
to mourn her.

364
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:58,600
It is really a pity that

365
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:01,200
from now on,

366
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:06,840
I can never see my chess mate again.

367
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:13,400
Thank you for interceding with His Majesty,
Spiritual Elder Fang.

368
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:15,240
Thanks to you, I can bury Old Man Wu,

369
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:18,320
Dean Ning and Yunniang together.

370
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:21,800
It is nothing.

371
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:24,200
No matter what happened,

372
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:27,400
he is a master of Junwu Academy

373
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:30,400
and my intimate friend.

374
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:39,200
Doctor Ba,

375
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:43,280
how is His Majesty now?

376
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:49,840
His Majesty has high-level cultivation base

377
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:52,480
and has taken my medicinal pills
to nurse his body.

378
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:54,760
Now he is quite fine now.

379
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:59,200
But...

380
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:07,320
Please be frank with me, Doctor Ba.

381
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:10,800
It was rumored previously that

382
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:13,560
someone tried to murder His Majesty,

383
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:15,520
Is that true?

384
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:18,720
A maidservant really

385
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:21,680
mentioned this in her suicide note.

386
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:25,000
But we are still not sure

387
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,720
who has tried to murder
His Majesty specifically.

388
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:33,040
Once Old Man Wu died,

389
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:36,120
all blame was shifted to him.

390
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:40,120
The matter was settled with nothing definite.

391
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:43,160
I don't think this matter is that simple.

392
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:44,880
With his strength,

393
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:47,120
he could take
the Deadly Vessel-rupturing Pill

394
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:50,800
and rush into the Divine Hall
after killing Dean Ning.

395
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:53,000
He needn't have resorted to such poison

396
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:55,360
that takes a long time to come into play.

397
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:56,680
I think it is unreasonable.

398
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,000
Feng Wu said the right thing.

399
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:00,560
She has analyzed this matter
with me previously.

400
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,800
I also felt that
there is something weird in it.

401
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:04,880
We can't let our guard down.

402
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:14,400
Here are the big storms
in the capital.

403
00:34:15,710 --> 00:34:18,520
I'd better set out as soon as possible

404
00:34:18,710 --> 00:34:20,150
and return to the Border City.

405
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:23,150
Feng Wu,

406
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:26,040
when you are free,

407
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:28,230
remember to go to
the Border City to visit me.

408
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,080
I will wait for you to cook me
some delicious dishes.

409
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:37,670
Grandpa Ba.

410
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:41,040
I am just kidding.

411
00:34:44,190 --> 00:34:46,520
You have things to attend to.

412
00:34:46,630 --> 00:34:49,560
I will be happy as long as
you keep me in your mind.

413
00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:53,710
We will meet again when the time comes.

414
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:58,360
I will be off now.

415
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:01,200
Take care.

416
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:03,800
Goodbye.

417
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:08,520
I am leaving.

418
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:23,440
Your Majesty,

419
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:25,000
it seems that Feng Wu is really

420
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:26,400
a wicked girl possessed by the evil spirit.

421
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,960
If she is allowed to be together
with His Highness Jun,

422
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:30,600
the whole Junwu Clan

423
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:31,600
and the whole Qianyuan Continent

424
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:33,200
may run into danger.

425
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:35,240
If what she said is true,

426
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:36,920
Feng Wu

427
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:40,120
may cause the biggest change to the plan.

428
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:44,440
Rise to your feet.

429
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:54,000
You snatched her Phoenix Blood from her.

430
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:57,080
She didn't know it in the past.

431
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:59,040
But now she knows it.

432
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:01,320
Even if you don't kill her,

433
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:03,360
she will come at you.

434
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:05,440
I understand that.

435
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:07,840
However, Crown Prince is protecting her.

436
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:10,480
And her spirit energy
is increasing day by day.

437
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:13,520
It is not easy to kill her.

438
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:18,840
Thus, you need greater power.

439
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:20,640
If you have the power,

440
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:23,880
the Phoenix Blood
will be melted into your body.

441
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:27,280
Only in this way can you beat Feng Wu.

442
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:37,960
Lord Demon.

443
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:40,880
I can ask him to

444
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:43,240
give you what you want.

445
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:45,520
You can decide to

446
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:47,840
accept it or not.

447
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:04,200
The Star Shard.

448
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:06,960
So you are awake.

449
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:09,360
When you should wake up, you didn't.

450
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:11,200
Why are you out to have a hand in it now?

451
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,880
I wanted you to stand on your own feet.

452
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:16,640
I didn't expect that

453
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:18,120
you would find the second piece
of Star Shard so soon.

454
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:21,400
But the course of self-reliance

455
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:23,240
is tortuous and bumpy.

456
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:27,600
With Lord Mu's manuscript,

457
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:30,200
your spirit energy will
be increased to a new level.

458
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:38,480
Now,

459
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:42,480
I still need to get
another piece of Star Shard

460
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,200
and the Phoenix Blood.

461
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:52,640
It seems that

462
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:55,440
a greater crisis is coming.

463
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:03,800
That person

464
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:06,120
wants you to go over.

465
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:10,080
I got it.

466
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:21,120
You prestigious and righteous sects
are really hilarious.

467
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:24,000
Though you label us
as the demonic and heterodox cults

468
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,440
and despise us,

469
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:30,320
you have to resort to our power in the end.

470
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,400
Spirit energy is no more than spirit energy.

471
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,360
Likewise, demonic and heterodox practices

472
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:36,760
will never change in nature.

473
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:39,640
These two are totally different.

474
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:50,000
When you get this power,

475
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:55,400
can you still tell
whether you are evil or good?

476
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:58,120
Feng Wu.

477
00:40:58,840 --> 00:40:59,720
Huang Li.

478
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:06,560
Are you waiting for me?

479
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:11,120
I will leave you two to talk.

480
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:18,240
Now tell me. What is the matter exactly?

481
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:20,080
Feng Wu.

482
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:21,560
Because of my testimony,

483
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:23,360
you were put in detention room.

484
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:25,200
I am very sorry.

485
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,720
Just let the bygones be bygones.

486
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:29,480
I know you didn't do it purposefully.

487
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:30,840
You might have just
mistaken me for someone else.

488
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:31,840
No. No. No.

489
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,240
I didn't mistake you for anyone else.

490
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:35,040
To make sure it was you,

491
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:36,600
I called your name at that time.

492
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:38,280
You stopped to respond to me.

493
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:42,640
Feng Wu.

494
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:50,240
Feng Wu.

495
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:58,200
Do you mean I...

496
00:41:58,640 --> 00:41:59,200
No.

497
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:02,480
You mean that
another Feng Wu responded to you.

498
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:04,440
That's why

499
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:06,000
I was convinced that you were that person!

500
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:07,480
So it means

501
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:09,400
somebody disguised herself as me

502
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:12,360
and let me take the blame
for Dean Ning's death.

503
