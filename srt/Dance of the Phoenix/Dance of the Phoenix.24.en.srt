2
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:40,420
(Episode 24)

3
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,400
That's to say,

4
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,400
Feng Wu is indeed livelier and brighter now.

5
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:49,640
Previously, after her father passed away,

6
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:51,760
she always kept things to herself.

7
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:53,840
But all the people will grow up.

8
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,480
That doesn't show anything.

9
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,440
But don't you think since
she came to the capital,

10
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:01,640
it seems nothing has happened by chance

11
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:04,880
but done on purpose
after being carefully planned?

12
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:07,640
If the current Feng Wu

13
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,960
is really someone else,

14
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:11,840
won't all these coincidences make sense?

15
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,480
I guess

16
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:14,920
someone must be

17
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,120
guiding the current Feng Wu secretly

18
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,920
for some purpose we don't know.

19
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:22,560
Zhao Ge,

20
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,120
think about it.

21
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,640
I've always been on your side

22
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,880
and considerate of you.
Do you think I'll harm you?

23
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:32,600
I just don't want you to be deceived

24
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:35,000
and used because of being kind and innocent.

25
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:39,200
Zhao Ge, we're at a critical juncture.

26
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,040
If you think of anything,

27
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,440
don't keep it from me again.

28
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:43,440
Think about it.

29
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:46,440
If the current Feng Wu is really a fake,

30
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:48,160
where's the real one?

31
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,840
Is she dead or alive?

32
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,480
Have you thought about these questions?

33
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,360
Did you think of something?

34
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:04,800
I saw Wu talking

35
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:08,360
to the ring on her chest.

36
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,440
Ring?

37
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,480
Senior Sister.

38
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:14,560
Can you prove what you said?

39
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:17,560
Yes,

40
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,200
but I need your cooperation.

41
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,000
me?

42
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,560
Is Wu

43
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:29,080
really a fake?

44
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,520
Why hasn't she come back?

45
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:35,440
Zhao Ge.

46
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:36,720
Wu.

47
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:39,440
Great.

48
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,160
I thought you got lost.

49
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:43,720
Wu, you're back.

50
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,600
You were away for a long time

51
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:46,880
so I came back first.

52
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,280
I'm sorry.

53
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,520
I had got rid of Yu Mingye

54
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:53,240
but later I ran into Jun Linyuan.

55
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,840
Are you mad at me?

56
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,080
It's okay. It's okay.

57
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,480
You were supposed to watch

58
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:59,920
the fireworks with His Highness Jun tonight.

59
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,640
Zhao Ge,

60
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,040
you're really a good friend.

61
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,440
I'll make

62
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:08,960
a new thing for you.

63
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,040
Master Feng noodles.

64
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:13,600
What do you think?

65
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:18,000
You must be tired.

66
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,510
I've prepared your clothes.

67
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,880
Take a warm bath.

68
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,120
I've got the water ready for you.

69
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,200
It'll get cold soon.

70
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:27,960
I'll do it now.

71
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:33,000
You're really something.

72
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:36,640
We're killing two birds with one stone.

73
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:37,360
Your Majesty,

74
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:38,760
now we just need

75
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,200
to wait for Feng Wu

76
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,840
to walk into our trap.

77
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:47,280
I hope we can smoothly
dispose of her this time.

78
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,320
The Purgatorial Place?

79
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,720
The Purgatorial Place is located

80
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,800
on Baiding Mountain outside the capital.

81
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,520
It's said

82
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:58,400
that an old fairy with great spirit energy
is living in seclusion there.

83
00:05:58,760 --> 00:05:59,640
She's psychic

84
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,000
and does best in casting out demons.

85
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,000
Take the ring you talked about to her.

86
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,720
She will resolve your doubts.

87
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,680
It'll be great if our concern

88
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:14,840
is misplaced.

89
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,840
But if I guessed right

90
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,880
and Feng Wu is really a fake,

91
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,160
it'll be a serious matter.

92
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,600
You can't imagine what it'll involve.

93
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:25,560
So

94
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,320
you mustn't tell anyone.

95
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,320
Do you know?

96
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:34,080
Your Majesty,

97
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,600
I mentioned that before.

98
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,600
Don't worry.

99
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:39,800
I remember it.

100
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:43,520
Zhao Ge is my junior sister's child.

101
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,520
I won't let her be in danger.

102
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:49,160
But Feng Wu will be a pitiful sight.

103
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:50,960
She'll never know

104
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:54,040
what's waiting for her

105
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:56,080
on Baiding Mountain.

106
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,280
Get up now.

107
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,720
You did a good job

108
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,280
and solved a big issue.

109
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:20,720
But

110
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:24,440
you should have shown me that ring.

111
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:26,840
If it's really a boon for cultivators,

112
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,960
it'll be a shame to waste like that.

113
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,480
I've been negligent.

114
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:32,680
It's okay.

115
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,600
You've done really well.

116
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,400
Go and keep practising.

117
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:37,640
Yes.

118
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,640
To be on the safe side,

119
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,680
you go there as well.

120
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:56,080
Find a chance, net them all

121
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,960
and rid us of any further trouble.

122
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:24,080
Where on earth is that old fairy?

123
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,760
Did I come to the wrong place?

124
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:11,000
About thirty minutes ago,

125
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,720
there was indeed a female disciple
from Junwu Academy

126
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:13,480
who went out of town.

127
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:15,000
Do you know where she was going?

128
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,560
I have no idea.

129
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,080
But before she left, she asked other guards

130
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,880
how to get to Baiding Mountain.

131
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,320
Baiding Mountain.

132
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,760
Miss, you must stay away from that place.

133
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:26,480
There's a demon on it.

134
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:29,680
How come there's a demon around the capital

135
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,120
and it hasn't been killed?

136
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,520
You cultivators have seen

137
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,240
so many demonic beasts.

138
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,440
But you seldom see one
in the human form, don't you?

139
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,960
A 1000-year-old Demon Wolf
is confined on Baiding Mountain.

140
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,160
It was subdued by Mu Jiuzhou.

141
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,960
No one dares to get close to it except him,

142
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:44,280
let alone killing it.

143
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:46,600
But Miss, are you really going there?

144
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,480
My friend is most likely there.

145
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:49,640
I must go and check.

146
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:50,760
Thanks.

147
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:52,840
Feng Wu.

148
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:56,520
Feng Wu.

149
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:57,600
It's really you.

150
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:58,760
What are you doing here?

151
00:09:59,000 --> 00:09:59,880
Zhao Ge is missing.

152
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,000
I'm looking for her.

153
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:01,920
What's going on?

154
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,600
A guard said Zhao Ge may
have gone to Baiding Mountain.

155
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,040
So I'm going there.

156
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:06,760
No.

157
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:07,960
How could you go there alone?

158
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:08,640
I'll go with you.

159
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:09,760
No, you can't.

160
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,760
What if the guard was mistaken

161
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:12,600
and

162
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,720
Zhao Ge has gone back to the Academy?

163
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,720
You should go back and check.

164
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:17,760
By the way,

165
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,120
tell Jun Linyuan

166
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:20,360
my Dragon Phoenix Spirit Ring is missing.

167
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:21,640
Ask him to pay attention to it.

168
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:22,280
Okay.

169
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:25,200
Feng Wu, I haven't finished speaking yet.

170
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:26,800
Be careful.

171
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,440
Baiding Mountain?

172
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:12,800
You mean Feng Wu?

173
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:13,680
Yes.

174
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,960
She has got to the mountain top.

175
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,880
The demon on Baiding Mountain
has enormous spirit energy.

176
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,760
I guess she has been dead now.

177
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:22,880
Stop.

178
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,200
Even she's lucky to get away from there,

179
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,960
we must kill her on the way.

180
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:27,680
But.

181
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:28,840
It's an order.

182
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:29,720
My Lord.

183
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,080
Yu Mingye,

184
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,880
you're the Young Master of Darknight Court

185
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,160
and its future owner.

186
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,600
You've failed in several tasks

187
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,640
because of your feelings for her.

188
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,960
I just gave you a light punishment.

189
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,600
If our plan falls through

190
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,080
because of your sympathy again,

191
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,160
neither Darknight Court

192
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,960
nor I will forgive you.

193
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:56,680
Then

194
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:02,240
you'll really be an outcast.

195
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:06,920
I hope you won't let me down this time.

196
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:08,280
Off you go.

197
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:18,920
Love is really

198
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:28,320
the hardest thing to control in the world.

199
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,520
No.

200
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:48,440
Zhao Ge.

201
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,680
Zhao Ge.

202
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,160
Zhao Ge.

203
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:55,680
Zhao Ge.

204
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:05,560
Who are you?

205
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,400
These are Zhao Ge's clothes.

206
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:15,560
Where's she?

207
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:18,280
Don't go.

208
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:39,800
Say it.

209
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,480
What did you do to Zhao Ge?

210
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:45,560
If you don't,

211
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:46,960
I'll show no mercy to you.

212
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:49,160
Stop.

213
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:54,560
Zhao Ge.

214
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:56,760
We've looked everywhere.

215
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,360
Zhao Ge is really not at the Academy.

216
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:02,760
Boss Jun,

217
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:04,280
what should we do now?

218
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,920
It's a high rank spirit animal
on Baiding Mountain.

219
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:08,560
The whole Junwu Academy could do

220
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:09,600
nothing with it

221
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,120
and it wasn't defeated

222
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:12,200
until Mu Jiuzhou interfered.

223
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:14,320
If Feng Wu goes into its place,

224
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:15,920
the consequences will be unimaginable.

225
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:20,680
At any rate,

226
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,280
we need to go and check.

227
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:28,160
I asked you not to move

228
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:29,880
and you didn't listen to me.

229
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,640
Now your wounds have opened.

230
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:37,600
I know,

231
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:39,520
but you can't always be like this, can you?

232
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:42,320
Look. When can they heal?

233
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,280
That's more like it.

234
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:49,200
Zhao Ge,

235
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:50,640
you,

236
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:51,920
you understand what she says?

237
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,120
Miss Wolf said

238
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,560
I could speak the language of beasts.

239
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:01,800
The language of beasts?

240
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:04,400
But

241
00:17:05,070 --> 00:17:06,480
who's Miss Wolf?

242
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:08,000
She is.

243
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:12,400
What.

244
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,350
I heard

245
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:17,480
there's a demonic beast that has
cultivated for a thousand years here.

246
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,040
Is it her?

247
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,920
Miss Wolf is not a demon.

248
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:24,800
She's a white wolf that has
cultivated for a thousand years.

249
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,760
And she's not a bad person.

250
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:28,310
I fell down before

251
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:29,840
and she saved me.

252
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,040
She has cultivated for a thousand years.

253
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:56,960
She,

254
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:58,360
she's a human now.

255
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:02,840
She received the wounds in her arms

256
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:06,040
when the Academy tried to kill her.

257
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,080
There aren't any herbs here.

258
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:11,120
So

259
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:13,440
I could only bind them up

260
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:14,800
in a simple way.

261
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,400
But it should be impossible

262
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:19,880
for her to recover completely.

263
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:24,720
Allow me.

264
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:03,560
You indeed took it away.

265
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:05,440
Well.

266
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,280
What's wrong?

267
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:18,040
You mean the ring is belong to Mu Jiuzhou?

268
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,240
Mu Jiuzhou is my Master.

269
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,240
He confined you here before,

270
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,640
but don't worry.

271
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:26,000
We won't hurt you.

272
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:27,960
Wu,

273
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,000
Mu Jiuzhou is your Master?

274
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:35,640
So when you talked to that ring,

275
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,720
you were actually talking to your Master?

276
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,680
You heard it, didn't you?

277
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:41,560
Zhao Ge,

278
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:44,320
now that you had doubts,
why didn't you ask me?

279
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,280
Wu,

280
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:47,960
I'm sorry.

281
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,440
I shouldn't have been suspicious of you.

282
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:51,680
Never mind.

283
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,880
I kept you in the dark.

284
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:56,080
We're even, then.

285
00:19:59,080 --> 00:19:59,600
By the way,

286
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,880
why did my Master trap you here?

287
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:16,520
She said

288
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:18,840
She did something wicked.

289
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:19,960
I admit it,

290
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:27,520
but the cause is not what you think.

291
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:31,360
I was a white wolf in cultivation

292
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:34,520
and it took me a thousand years
to assume the human form.

293
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:39,400
Well.

294
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,760
I turned into a human

295
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,560
and came to Shen's Mansion in the capital.

296
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:52,480
I hid among humans as a maid

297
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:54,880
just for fun.

298
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:56,920
What's wrong with you?

299
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:58,680
You can't even pour the water well.

300
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:01,760
Don't be angry, Madam.

301
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,280
She's a new maid.

302
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,560
She's dumb and doesn't know any rules.

303
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,160
Leave right now.

304
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,040
Wait.

305
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:13,440
Unexpectedly,

306
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:15,400
I met him.

307
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:19,480
You burned yourself just now, didn't you?

308
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:24,600
Later,

309
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:27,680
he taught me to read

310
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,720
and brought me to a new life

311
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:31,320
-that I never knew.
-I'll teach you to write.

312
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,800
And a life I dare not to hope for.

313
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:36,400
Look.

314
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:37,680
You need to hold the brush like this

315
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:38,720
and put it flat.

316
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:42,520
No, no, no.

317
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:43,600
Like this.

318
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:45,400
Your hand.

319
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:50,800
Later,

320
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,760
we fell in love.

321
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:56,680
But

322
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,400
how could a demonic beast hope

323
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:00,200
for a human's love?

324
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:03,320
I told him what I was

325
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:05,600
and hoped he could forget me.

326
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:07,720
But,

327
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:09,880
are you telling the truth?

328
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:25,520
I don't regret it.

329
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:28,040
I don't want to leave you either.

330
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:31,760
Meeting you is
the greatest blessing in my life.

331
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:39,440
No, no.

332
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:20,440
I've prepared for the worst.

333
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:22,480
I can take any consequence.

334
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:24,840
I want to be with you forever

335
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,280
no matter what happens.

336
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:29,720
Later,

337
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,240
I was pregnant

338
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,960
and got used to being a human

339
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,680
instead of a beast.

340
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:37,400
However,

341
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:38,320
nothing

342
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,680
will go smoothly in this world.

343
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,080
Before long,

344
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:44,240
the Shen family found out

345
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:46,840
and strongly disapproved of our relationship.

346
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,320
My son,

347
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:50,640
-how could you be so stupid?
-Let go of her.

348
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:52,720
You refused to marry so many eminent ladies

349
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:55,360
-Let go of her.
-and had your eye on this servant.

350
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:57,360
Go.

351
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:10,400
Wait for me

352
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:11,720
at the pavilion on Baiding Mountain
three days later.

353
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:13,280
I will go to see you.

354
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:14,880
Drag her away.

355
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:16,400
-I will.
-Drag her away.

356
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:18,640
Let go.

357
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,280
I will go to see you.

358
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:22,800
Let go.

359
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:26,520
Go.

360
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:27,680
Let go.

361
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:29,740
Let go of her.

362
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:30,420
Shen's Mansion

363
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:38,720
I waited on Baiding Mountain for three days

364
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,760
but he didn't show up.

365
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,480
Another three days went by,

366
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,960
but he still didn't come.

367
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:53,460
Wangjun Pavilion

368
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:54,920
Three months later,

369
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:57,000
I still didn't see him.

370
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:00,760
I thought he regretted it.

371
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,880
I wanted to see him for the last time

372
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:09,000
and then

373
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,880
I'd leave this place forever.

374
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:15,540
Shen's Mansion

375
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:26,040
Help! Young Master tried to kill himself.

376
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:31,760
Help! Help! Young Master
tried to kill himself.

377
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:08,000
You're here.

378
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,280
I was trapped here all day.

379
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:15,480
I'm sorry that I couldn't go to see you.

380
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:18,640
I failed to keep my word.

381
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:33,560
I thought I could never see you again.

382
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,080
I didn't expect

383
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:39,480
I'd see you before I died.

384
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:47,840
I can die without regrets now.

385
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:30,560
She said

386
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:33,360
she only want to bring up her kids now.

387
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:43,800
She also thanked your Master.

388
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:46,800
If he hadn't let her live

389
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:48,480
for her pregnancy,

390
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:50,480
they would've

391
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:53,560
been dead now.

392
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:55,000
I'm sorry to hear that.

393
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:57,560
When your kids grow up,

394
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:59,000
where are you going to take them?

395
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:02,520
She said

396
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:05,360
half of her spirit energy had been restricted

397
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:08,160
and she couldn't cultivate anymore.

398
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:14,040
When her kids grow older,

399
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,280
they'll go into deep woods

400
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:18,960
and never come back.

401
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:28,720
As long as you're with your kids,

402
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:30,320
everything will go well.

403
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:33,200
She said thank you.

404
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:34,240
Not at all.

405
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:37,920
Zhao Ge,

406
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,920
I'll get some herbs.

407
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:41,480
We'll leave the mountain

408
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:42,800
when you feel better.

409
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:47,720
Wait for me.

410
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:19,960
Where on earth is Feng Wu?

411
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:22,240
Quickly. Hurry up to make the maze.

412
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:23,840
Squat down.

413
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:27,040
Look.

414
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:28,480
What's that?

415
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:30,960
Yu Mingye is also here.

416
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:32,320
What do they want to do?

417
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:33,880
They're making a maze

418
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:34,880
to stop people inside from coming out.

419
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,920
Yu Mingye won't hurt Feng Wu

420
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:40,520
however ruthless he is, will he?

421
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,840
I'll hold them up. You seize the chance

422
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
and look for Feng Wu and Zhao Ge.

423
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:45,840
No. It's too dangerous.

424
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:47,560
Shall we turn to the Academy?

425
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:49,480
It's not suitable to confront them now.

426
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:52,480
That's settled. Go now.

427
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:55,520
Let's go.

428
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,400
Do you know Feng Wu is on the mountain now?

429
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:12,640
It's unknown if she's alive.

430
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:17,920
Didn't you say you'd make her happy?

431
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:21,040
Is this your way to do that?

432
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:26,040
I was born in Darknight Court

433
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:28,840
and I'm Lord Demon's child.

434
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,240
Perhaps this is my fate.

435
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:35,600
I'm destined to be a villain

436
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:37,880
and never

437
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:39,560
to be with Feng Wu.

438
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:41,160
Only you can decide

439
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,440
what kind of person you are.

440
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:49,840
Actually I'm quite envious of you.

441
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:52,600
You can say things like that
without turning a hair,

442
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:55,040
but I can't.

443
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:01,720
I can't disobey Lord Demon.

444
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:04,320
At any rate,

445
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:06,600
he's my father.

446
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,000
In that case,

447
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:13,120
let's cut the crap.

448
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:46,600
Go.

449
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:49,800
Don't mind me. Fix it now.

450
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:56,240
Guys, fix the maze.

451
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:57,240
Yes.

452
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:00,120
Keep fixing the maze.

453
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:02,000
Fix the maze.

454
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:08,600
I'm back.

455
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:19,040
Zhao Ge.

456
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:20,640
Zhao Ge.

457
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:22,360
Zhao Ge, wake up.

458
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:28,000
Miss Wolf. Miss Wolf.

459
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:37,360
Kids.

460
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:38,960
Kids, wake up.

461
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:04,120
Miss Wolf.

462
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:06,200
What happened?

463
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:13,280
Miss Wolf.

464
00:34:40,630 --> 00:34:41,480
It's not me.

465
00:34:42,630 --> 00:34:43,840
It's really not me.

466
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:47,360
Miss Wolf.

467
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:00,400
It's not me.

468
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:02,240
Miss Wolf,

469
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:03,960
calm down.

470
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:05,920
It's really not me.

471
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:30,720
We've finally come to this moment.

472
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:36,400
You'll handle

473
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:38,480
the rest of the matter.

474
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:40,760
Go.

475
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:42,440
Yes.

476
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:39,360
-Zhao Ge.
-Feng Wu, are you okay?

477
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:40,200
Yes.

478
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:44,200
Zhao Ge.

479
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:45,720
Zhao Ge, wake up.

480
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:48,000
Feng Wu,

481
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:49,640
what did you do to her?

482
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:50,840
I did nothing.

483
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:52,840
I just went out to get some herbs

484
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:53,960
and she was like this already
when I came back.

485
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,480
She is not on the same level
as demonic beasts

486
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:56,760
we met before.

487
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:57,960
Let's leave now.

488
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:01,760
Come on.

489
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:04,440
Okay.

490
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:34,520
What are you doing?

491
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:43,440
My queen.

492
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:46,920
My queen.

493
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:50,480
What on earth is happening?

494
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:53,040
It's been so many years.

495
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:57,200
I've shown you the utmost patience

496
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:59,440
as your wife.

497
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:03,760
Originally I wanted to make you
lose your spirit energy with poison,

498
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:08,320
but unexpectedly Wu Youdao helped you

499
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:09,600
and upset my plan.

500
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:11,360
I had no choice but to do it early.

501
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:12,680
Your Majesty,

502
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:15,080
in your reign, people are suffered

503
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:16,680
and demonic beasts are running wild

504
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:18,360
on Qianyuan Continent.

505
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:21,480
Don't you feel guilty at all?

506
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,280
You evil woman,

507
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:28,960
the person who poisoned me before

508
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:32,080
was under your orders.

509
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:33,840
Soldiers,

510
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,040
arrest her.

511
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:40,000
What are you waiting for?

512
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:41,600
Arrest her.

513
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,240
You're always negligent
in running the country.

514
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:49,640
Now you see it, don't you?

515
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:52,120
You've lost people's support long ago

516
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:55,560
and you’re veritably without any
follower to trust now.

517
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:57,120
You.

518
