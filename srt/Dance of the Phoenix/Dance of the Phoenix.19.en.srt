00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:40,740
(Episode 19)

3
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:43,040
I just don't understand.

4
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,680
Zhao Ge betrayed you,

5
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:49,320
but why do you still protect her?

6
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:53,040
You shouldn't have persisted in your course.

7
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:55,240
Now the Celestial Palace's reputation
has been damaged.

8
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:58,320
Innocent people have been afflicted

9
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:59,400
by unexpected trouble.

10
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:04,480
I've realized my mistake.

11
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,880
I will handle the affair outside.

12
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:14,720
Just stay in the detention room

13
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,280
and reflect on yourself for a few days.

14
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:22,880
Senior Sister.

15
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:24,360
Senior Sister.

16
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:46,920
After all these years,

17
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:51,120
do I still mean less

18
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,360
than her to you?

19
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:13,960
Zhao Ge.

20
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,120
Don't worry.

21
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,240
Feng Wu has been making every moment count
in her swordsmanship training.

22
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:19,240
We will revenge for you.

23
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,760
If only I had arrived

24
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,640
earlier that day.

25
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,200
What do you think?

26
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,640
My swordsmanship has improved
with great speed, right?

27
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,080
You did improve a little,

28
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,520
but you still have many weak points.

29
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:08,640
You...

30
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:11,720
You...

31
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:12,160
Go on.

32
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,400
Why hasten to get out of bed?

33
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,680
You should have a rest to recuperate.

34
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,960
The match between Senior Sister
and Wu will start soon.

35
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,480
I want to watch the match.

36
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,600
Your injury is severe.

37
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,240
You can't stay outside for that long a time.

38
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:49,560
But

39
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,920
Wu has been training day and night.

40
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:53,400
I really hope

41
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,800
she'll have what she wants.

42
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:57,840
You should know

43
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,320
that my lack of talent

44
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:01,880
caused my mother,

45
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:04,400
the leader of the Celestial Palace,

46
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,280
to place all her hopes

47
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,640
on my Senior Sister.

48
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,480
She demands that
Senior Sister win every time.

49
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,840
Senior Sister

50
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:16,000
has been burdened with my responsibilities.

51
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,560
That's why her life has been so tiring.

52
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:20,960
Actually,

53
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,800
I'm feeling torn.

54
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,200
So

55
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,240
you have so many worries.

56
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:36,680
I just chose to run away from the things

57
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,160
I can't change.

58
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,760
I hope Wu will win

59
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:47,280
because this match means more to her.

60
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,840
So I want to have a look.

61
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,960
I'm sure Feng Wu will win.

62
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:56,640
How about this?

63
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,400
I will watch the match for you.

64
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,320
Then I will come back
and tell you the result.

65
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:01,480
Alright?

66
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,120
I'm so useless.

67
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,760
My cultivation base is less than desirable.

68
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:09,160
The food I made was disliked.

69
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:12,120
Now I can't even cheer for Wu.

70
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,720
That's why you should make greater efforts.

71
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,520
The Zhao Ge I know doesn't

72
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:21,080
keep beating herself up.

73
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,240
I won't be a burden to you.

74
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,480
I'll get well soon.

75
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:37,000
The match means a lot to Feng Wu?

76
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,560
But it also means a lot to me.

77
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:42,800
Feng Wu,

78
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,360
why do you always get

79
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,840
everything I want so easily?

80
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,320
This match

81
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,320
is a communication between two schoolmates.

82
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:28,320
Remember to stop before causing harm.

83
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:31,600
Whoever loses the ribbon on her arm

84
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,440
loses the match.

85
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,480
Remember

86
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,120
not to inflict harm.

87
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:41,200
The match begins now.

88
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,030
A senior-rank spiritual practitioner

89
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,720
ties with a Great Spiritual Master?

90
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,080
What a rare scene.

91
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,520
Nonsense.

92
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:42,790
The match has just begun.

93
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,320
Senior Sister hasn't unleashed her power yet.

94
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,800
Just wait and see.

95
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:33,680
Boss Jun.

96
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,920
The swordsmanship looks familiar.

97
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,360
What's going on?

98
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:59,560
It's Junwu Clan's special swordsmanship.

99
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:07,280
I wanted to end this match quickly.

100
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:11,360
But it turns out I underestimated you.

101
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,440
Ice Bird!

102
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,520
She made such a powerful move here.

103
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:48,760
I didn't expect you

104
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,840
to have restored so much spirit energy.

105
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,040
Feng Wu,

106
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:59,320
perhaps I shouldn't have treated you lightly.

107
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,320
I should have

108
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:04,200
ended you once and for all that day.

109
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:29,880
What's going on?

110
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:32,400
Phoenix Blood.

111
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:33,160
Feng Wu.

112
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,120
She has Phoenix Blood.

113
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,880
The result of the match has been determined.

114
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:41,680
Feng Wu won!

115
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:47,560
What is this?

116
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:48,880
It's none of your business.

117
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:58,960
Feng Wu, what's wrong?

118
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:01,200
It's her.

119
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,240
She took my Phoenix Blood.

120
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:04,280
Let go of me

121
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:06,480
or I won't go easy on you.

122
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:07,600
You can try.

123
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,080
I have never feared anyone
when it comes to fighting.

124
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:14,160
The Holy Queen has arrived!

125
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,080
You two, stop it now.

126
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,200
What happened?

127
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:51,880
Your Majesty,

128
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:54,240
I lost the match due to my failure
to master the fighting skills.

129
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:55,280
I admitted my defeat.

130
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:58,280
But my classmate still harasses me.

131
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:01,520
Why?

132
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,120
Your Majesty,

133
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:06,480
the Phoenix Blood I lost

134
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:08,800
is in Zuo Qingluan's Ice Bracelet.

135
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,000
Your Majesty, please make a judgment

136
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,640
and let me recover my Phoenix Blood.

137
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,160
So that's what happened.

138
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,000
I think you are mistaken.

139
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:30,280
I gave Goddess Zuo the Ice Bracelet.

140
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:33,840
Are you saying that I stole your Phoenix Blood

141
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,200
and gave it to her?

142
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:37,280
What?

143
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:39,480
Feng Wu,

144
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,280
I know what happened to you

145
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:44,200
and I sympathize with you,

146
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:46,880
but watch your mouth,

147
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,040
it's inappropriate

148
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:51,000
to slander your schoolmate.

149
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,640
You won this match.

150
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:58,440
I look forward to the swordsmanship dance
of you and Linyuan.

151
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,880
Now you may focus on practicing.

152
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:27,720
Are you sure you saw Phoenix Blood?

153
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:29,800
I saw it for real.

154
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,760
Even you don't believe me?

155
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:39,200
Wu.

156
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:43,320
Wu.

157
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,800
I didn't go and watch your match.

158
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,000
But I can imagine

159
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:47,360
how dangerous it must be.

160
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:48,440
Let them go.

161
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,000
Zhao Ge.

162
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,520
You believe me, right?

163
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,040
I...

164
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,280
I know

165
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:02,080
Senior Sister has always wanted
to surpass you.

166
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:03,920
But she is not the type of person

167
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:06,310
who would do such a thing.

168
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,720
Don't be mad at me, Wu.

169
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:14,830
She is your Senior Sister
who grew up with you.

170
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:16,590
I can understand.

171
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,040
Wu.

172
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,480
Don't be mad.

173
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,350
Boss Jun, what do you think?

174
00:17:24,070 --> 00:17:25,590
What can Jun Linyuan think?

175
00:17:26,110 --> 00:17:27,480
Your Holy Queen said

176
00:17:27,590 --> 00:17:28,880
the Ice Bracelet was a gift from her.

177
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:31,600
He can't question your Holy Queen, can he?

178
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,520
If I were him,

179
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:37,440
I would get to the bottom of this

180
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,000
for the girl I love.

181
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,160
Your Boss Jun

182
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,080
has too many burdens.

183
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,480
Your words are sweet.

184
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:45,520
But I'd like to see you take action.

185
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,560
It's Junwu Clan's business

186
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:49,440
and has nothing to do
with the Darknight Court.

187
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:50,880
Besides,

188
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,160
it's better to have you do nothing.

189
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:55,480
This way, a certain person will seek my help

190
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:58,160
and I will take action then.

191
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:00,120
Let's get out of here.

192
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:02,720
Let Feng Wu have a good rest.

193
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,320
Boss Jun...

194
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:11,320
Boss Jun.

195
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,720
Should we leave

196
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:16,960
that guy in the room?

197
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:21,240
I need you to do me a favor.

198
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:22,120
Just say it.

199
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:25,560
Something must be wrong.

200
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:29,680
But my position hinders me
from investigating.

201
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:30,280
So...

202
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:34,000
You mean Holy Queen Gao...

203
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,840
I don't think Feng Wu
would lie on this matter.

204
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:38,280
I see.

205
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:39,840
Boss Jun, don't worry.

206
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:41,400
We'll get to the bottom of this

207
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:42,520
and find out the truth for you.

208
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:46,400
Little Feng Wu, don't be sad.

209
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:47,000
Come on.

210
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,560
I have got you a plaster
from the Darknight Court.

211
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:50,600
It works wonders.

212
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:53,080
Your wound will be healed instantly.

213
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:54,400
Boss Jun.

214
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:57,720
We should get back.

215
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,200
We should focus on finding out the truth.

216
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,040
I was careless for a moment

217
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,200
and lost to Feng Wu

218
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:10,920
and the right to perform.

219
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:12,880
I have let you down.

220
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,800
Please punish me.

221
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:23,760
It's just a swordsmanship dance.

222
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,880
Don't take it to heart.

223
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,120
Let me see.

224
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,120
What?

225
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,640
Now

226
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:37,640
you're still keeping things from me?

227
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:55,800
Feng Wu

228
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:58,520
was a rare cultivation genius

229
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:01,400
of the younger generation in the capital

230
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:04,160
until she lost her Phoenix Blood.

231
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:07,720
A small mistake can lead
to grave consequences.

232
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,600
Unfortunately,

233
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:12,920
not everyone can

234
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:15,280
absorb Phoenix Blood.

235
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:19,960
Phoenix Blood is just a still object
in certain people's hands.

236
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:22,280
What do you think?

237
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,720
Your Majesty, I...

238
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,680
The good thing is that

239
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:30,760
without her Phoenix Blood,

240
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:32,480
Feng Wu won't be recognized by Junwu Clan

241
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:35,080
as the Spiritual Princess.

242
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:39,920
I gave you the Ice Bracelet.

243
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,520
Keep it well.

244
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:54,560
I know.

245
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,600
Thank you for your consideration.

246
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,160
By the way,

247
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,000
I have told the Academy

248
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:02,080
to release your Junior Sister.

249
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:04,240
You must discipline her after you go back.

250
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:06,400
Don't ruin your future

251
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:08,760
for a nobody.

252
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:09,880
Yes.

253
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:12,080
Thank you for guiding me.

254
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:14,200
You can leave now.

255
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:45,320
Goddess Zuo.

256
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,120
Her Majesty told me to give you this thing.

257
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:53,040
It's a fine pill

258
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,600
that can only be found in Junwu Divine Hall.

259
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:56,360
Rest well to recuperate.

260
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,240
That's very kind of her.

261
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:06,560
She cherishes our ties.

262
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:10,960
I'll thank her face-to-face for my disciple.

263
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:20,080
Master.

264
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:21,440
What brought you here?

265
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:25,040
Holy Queen Gao's birthday
is around the corner.

266
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,400
The Celestial Palace ought
to celebrate her birthday.

267
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:32,280
I dropped by to see

268
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:34,440
if the Holy Queen has abandoned you.

269
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:35,320
Master.

270
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:38,640
I was careless during the match.

271
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:39,680
Next time I will...

272
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,560
There is no next time.

273
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,400
You lost the opportunity. And that's it.

274
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:51,920
Luckily, the Holy Queen hasn't
completely lost faith in you.

275
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,160
The goddess of the Celestial Palace

276
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,320
was born with pride.

277
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:58,840
How can you hang your head?

278
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,440
I've prepared a birthday present

279
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,440
for you to give the Holy Queen.

280
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,280
As long as she remembers

281
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,440
that she was once a disciple
of the Celestial Palace

282
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,080
and has the wish to help you,

283
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:10,520
you will succeed.

284
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,280
Get yourself together.

285
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,280
Yes, Master.

286
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:26,000
That was your Phoenix Blood.

287
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:27,400
I'm not mistaken.

288
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:30,880
Holy Queen Gao defended her in public.

289
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:33,400
Nobody would believe me.

290
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:36,720
Besides, Zuo Qingluan has

291
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,360
much more spirit energy than me.

292
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,680
I can't just snatch Phoenix Blood.

293
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:44,120
Then try to come up with a solution.

294
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:46,600
Someone is coming.

295
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:01,360
I couldn't find you anywhere.

296
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:02,920
Then I thought you might be here.

297
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:05,040
I thought you didn't believe me.

298
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:16,120
I believe in evidence.

299
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:18,880
But I believe in you more.

300
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,200
Then why did you remain silent?

301
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,600
I need some more time.

302
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:29,920
After all, I'm suspecting
important people and things.

303
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:31,520
Take any action rashly

304
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:33,360
and we'll be in a passive position.

305
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:36,200
We?

306
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:36,920
What?

307
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:38,720
Aren't you and I

308
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:40,760
"we"?

309
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:43,920
When did I agree to that?

310
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,400
There is no "we".

311
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,240
Alright. Don't think too much.

312
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:52,520
Appreciate the moon with me.

313
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:57,800
I know you are troubled.

314
00:24:58,840 --> 00:24:59,520
I'm not.

315
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:01,920
You don't have to talk about it.

316
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,320
I will be with you.

317
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,760
For how long?

318
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:11,680
Forever.

319
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:18,760
Whatever.

320
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:22,200
The result doesn't matter.

321
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:26,880
It's enough to appreciate the moon together.

322
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:37,340
(Junwu Gate)

323
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:11,720
I'm so excited about the performance

324
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:13,400
Wu and His Highness Jun will give today.

325
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:20,880
Miss Zhao Ge,

326
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:23,400
please watch your manners.

327
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:32,000
Yi.

328
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,680
Is that your grandfather?

329
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:38,400
Yes.

330
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:41,920
His beard is really white.

331
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:51,120
Zhao Ge,

332
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:52,640
how is your health?

333
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,240
Why didn't you rest for a few more days?

334
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:56,200
Feng Wu took good care of me.

335
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:58,000
Now I have recovered. I'm fine.

336
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:58,920
Besides,

337
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:00,400
I don't want to miss

338
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:01,480
the performance of Wu and His Highness Jun.

339
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:04,400
Nice.

340
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:05,200
Look.

341
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:07,400
I have even brought a pad of paper.

342
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:09,240
I will draw their

343
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:10,360
dance postures

344
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:11,560
and give the pad to Wu.

345
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,040
What do you think, Yi?

346
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:16,840
You are well-prepared.

347
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:24,240
The Holy Queen has arrived.

348
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:34,680
Greetings to you, Your Majesty.

349
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:20,760
Why is she there?

350
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:23,800
It looks odd.

351
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:40,640
My queen, here.

352
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:41,800
Take a seat.

353
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,040
Take a seat.

354
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:20,440
The birthday performance will begin soon.

355
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:23,520
Crown Prince, Feng Wu,
please come onto the stage.

356
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:42,920
Nice.

357
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:44,880
Good.

358
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:04,840
I wish you longevity and an unmatched
cultivation base, Your Majesty.

359
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:10,560
I wish you longevity and an unmatched
cultivation base, Your Majesty.

360
00:34:10,630 --> 00:34:11,320
Good.

361
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:12,920
Good.

362
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:20,360
Your Majesty the Holy Sovereign,
Your Majesty the Holy Queen,

363
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:22,400
Feng Wu and I need to change our costumes
back to our usual outfits.

364
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,880
OK. Go now.

365
00:34:34,670 --> 00:34:35,440
Your Majesty.

366
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,400
As it happens,

367
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:39,400
the female disciple who just performed

368
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:41,560
helped me give birth to my child

369
00:34:41,630 --> 00:34:42,710
and it's the only reason

370
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:44,440
that I survived the delivery.

371
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:47,710
Really?

372
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:51,840
It seems the female disciple

373
00:34:52,230 --> 00:34:53,520
really is exceptionally talented.

374
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:55,400
She has great swordsmanship

375
00:34:55,710 --> 00:34:57,000
as well as medical skills.

376
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:58,240
That's right.

377
00:34:58,520 --> 00:34:59,600
What's more,

378
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:01,600
do you know

379
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,560
that the female disciple
who performed the swordsmanship

380
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:06,680
is Feng Wu, the next master
of the Feng family?

381
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:08,280
Feng Wu?

382
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:11,400
The girl engaged

383
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:13,840
to Linyuan years ago?

384
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:14,880
Yes.

385
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:34,400
I came to celebrate Your Majesty's birthday
on behalf of the Celestial Palace

386
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:36,680
with this present.

387
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:38,400
Legend says

388
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:40,280
the silk made by mermaids

389
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:43,320
doesn't become wet (Shi) in water
and shines brightly.

390
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:45,480
Using a homophone,

391
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:47,640
I wish you all the best (Shi).

392
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:55,640
Why didn't she use the homophone

393
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:57,400
to wish the Holy Queen
all the troubles (Shi)?

394
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:00,200
Don't mock Senior Sister.

395
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:02,160
She just conveyed her good wish.

396
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,240
Good.

397
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:04,440
Your Majesty,

398
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:07,640
don't you think this girl

399
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:10,040
and Linyuan are a good match?

400
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:12,560
They can be a perfect couple.

401
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:17,320
Yes, she is good.

402
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:25,520
My disciple doesn't deserve

403
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:28,640
your high regard.

404
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:31,080
I feel flattered.

405
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:32,920
You are being too modest.

406
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:35,960
Qingluan stands out

407
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:37,960
from other young cultivators in the capital.

408
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:40,480
You taught her well.

409
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:43,560
Alright.

410
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,160
In that case...

411
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:46,960
Wait!

412
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:03,160
I've already found a girl I love.

413
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:05,440
She is Feng Wu.

414
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:09,520
Did you say that because you cherish
your friendship with her

415
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,880
and don't want her
to have trouble finding a husband

416
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:13,360
after the engagement was canceled?

417
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:15,640
But everyone saw Miss Feng's elegant demeanor

418
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:18,520
during today's performance.

419
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:21,480
It's not difficult for her
to find a husband now.

420
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:24,040
Don't worry about her.

421
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:25,680
I truly love Feng Wu

422
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:27,440
and want her as my Spiritual Princess.

423
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:28,920
Please grant us marriage.

424
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:30,800
Insolent child!

425
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:36,000
You are Junwu Clan's next Holy Sovereign.

426
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:40,160
Your marriage isn't for you to decide.

427
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:42,920
Take it easy, Your Majesty.

428
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:45,800
Linyuan is just naive.

429
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:49,280
We should discuss this matter another day.

430
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:50,520
No.

431
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:52,560
I have made up my mind.

432
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:54,440
Don't make arrangements for me, Your Majesty.

433
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:55,160
You...

434
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:56,000
Your Majesty.

435
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:38,760
I wish I could see you

436
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:45,480
in armor, looking mighty and powerful.

437
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:52,080
You will govern Junwu well.

438
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:53,800
What a shame

439
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:59,040
that I won't get to see you do that.

440
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:05,200
Who drew this?

441
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:08,600
I did.

442
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:17,160
Feng Wu.

443
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:19,680
Yes.

444
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:21,960
Good.

445
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:23,960
Listen.

446
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:27,560
If you can recover your Phoenix Blood,

447
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:30,920
you'll get to become
Jun Linyuan's Spiritual Princess.

448
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:33,600
Thank you, Your Majesty.
