2
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:40,380
(Episode 21)

3
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,560
He often plays petty tricks.

4
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,280
Is that so?

5
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,960
Spend enough time with him and you'll see.

6
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,760
Why did you gather us here

7
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,160
in the middle of the night?

8
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,880
I simply followed an order.

9
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,200
You may ask the Holy Queen

10
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,360
for details.

11
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,080
Alright.

12
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:08,080
This way, please.

13
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:10,630
Spiritual Elder Fang,

14
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,680
why are we summoned here

15
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,360
in the middle of the night?

16
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,920
I'm not sure.

17
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:19,720
Let's go and find out.

18
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,480
Where are the others?

19
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:22,840
On my way here,

20
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:24,400
I saw other people coming.

21
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:25,840
But I didn't see Supervisor Wu.

22
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,880
I wonder where he went to buy wine this time.

23
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:30,000
It's not the first time he has done so.

24
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,280
I'm used to it.

25
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,080
Come on. Let's get inside and have a look.

26
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:35,040
After you.

27
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:43,800
Wait.

28
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,200
My Lady, where are you going?

29
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,400
Library Pavilion.

30
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,000
Why are you going to Library Pavilion?

31
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:50,640
To read books.

32
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:54,720
And try to find clues.

33
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,480
It's Chinese Valentine's Day.

34
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,320
You should at least have a night out.

35
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:01,080
The man I waited for didn't show up anyway.

36
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,280
Forget it.

37
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:03,880
Qiu Ling,

38
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,960
after you are done here,

39
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,080
you should go out.

40
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:08,920
Maybe

41
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,200
you'll find your future husband outside.

42
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,880
As I expected, nobody is celebrating
Chinese Valentine's Day

43
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,840
with Old Man Wu.

44
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:26,720
Since he is here now,

45
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:29,160
I should go upstairs
and visit this lonely old man.

46
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,240
It should be fine.

47
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:52,840
Old Man Wu.

48
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:58,480
Dean!

49
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:01,680
Dean!

50
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,000
Dean!

51
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,480
Dean!

52
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:06,240
No...

53
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:12,240
Look at that.

54
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,200
Help!

55
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:15,760
Dean!

56
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:16,800
-Dean!
-What is that sound?

57
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,240
Let's get inside and have a look.

58
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,270
Help!

59
00:04:19,270 --> 00:04:19,800
Follow me.

60
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:20,600
Dean!

61
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,520
You, go upstairs for a look.

62
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,200
Yes.

63
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,720
What happened?

64
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,000
I didn't do this to him.

65
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:49,720
I didn't do it.

66
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:53,840
Take her with us.

67
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:57,000
What are you doing?

68
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:58,520
I didn't do it.

69
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,280
It has nothing to do with me.

70
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,080
Stop struggling.

71
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:17,640
Tell me.

72
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,600
Why did you murder Dean Ning?

73
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:21,520
I didn't murder him.

74
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,240
When I reached that place,

75
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,640
Dean Ning was dead already.

76
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:26,200
We had our people investigate in the academy.

77
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:29,560
Someone saw you lurking

78
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,800
around Library Pavilion
two hours before the murder.

79
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:33,800
That's slander!

80
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:34,680
Who said so?

81
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,320
I want to confront this person.

82
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,760
Tell us everything you saw.

83
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:52,760
Two hours ago,

84
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,800
when I was waiting for someone
near Library Pavilion,

85
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,320
I saw...

86
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:59,080
I saw Feng Wu enter Library Pavilion.

87
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,440
That's not true.

88
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,240
My maid can testify for me.

89
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,600
I stayed in the female room the whole time.

90
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:05,880
I never went out.

91
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,280
Of course your maid

92
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,000
would defend you.

93
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:11,440
Why would you slander me?

94
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,680
I didn't slander you.

95
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,240
I really saw her.

96
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:15,480
You are dismissed.

97
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,240
Now

98
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:24,080
will you confess or not?

99
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,080
I didn't do it.

100
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,400
Why should I confess?

101
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,600
How stubborn.

102
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,720
After we get to the bottom of this,

103
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:33,200
you'll be handed over
to the academy for punishment.

104
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,680
I didn't do it!

105
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,720
So, when you reached Library Pavilion,

106
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,720
Dean Ning was dead already?

107
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:46,520
Yes.

108
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,200
I just heard

109
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:51,320
that Dean Ning was going to
consult the books in Library Pavilion.

110
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:54,720
And I wanted to follow him
and see what would happen.

111
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:56,760
I didn't expect this to happen.

112
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:59,120
Then it occurred to me

113
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:02,200
that I might remove the thorn in your side.

114
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:06,440
As it happened, Feng Wu was there.

115
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:10,240
I'm sure she can't defend herself now.

116
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,360
You call her the thorn in my side.

117
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,840
But she is also the thorn in your side.

118
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,360
I was planning

119
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,880
to use the Holy Sovereign's illness
as an excuse

120
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,040
to remove the hidden obstacles
in Junwu Academy.

121
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:28,000
Now the opportunity has come.

122
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,640
We shall have a clean sweep.

123
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,600
Crown Prince will take care of
the Holy Sovereign in his bedroom tonight.

124
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,440
If you are free tonight,

125
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,840
go there and stay with him.

126
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:42,200
But His Highness Jun
seemed resolute last time.

127
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:43,560
I'm afraid...

128
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,720
That doesn't matter.

129
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,200
Just keep close watch on him.

130
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,760
Don't let him sabotage my plan.

131
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:50,920
Yes.

132
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:00,800
Feng Wu?

133
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,400
No way.

134
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:03,720
I don't believe

135
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,280
Feng Wu would do such a thing, either.

136
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:06,520
But

137
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,920
when I met her again in the Border City,

138
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:13,080
she felt totally different to me.

139
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:13,880
Feng Wu is no match

140
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:15,280
for Dean Ning.

141
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,560
She couldn't have killed him.

142
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:17,440
Indeed.

143
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,120
But when Feng Wu fought me during the match,

144
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,280
she showed
an exceptional amount of spirit energy.

145
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,560
We can't be sure

146
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,920
if there is a grand scheme behind her.

147
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:30,640
What you said

148
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:32,480
was just your speculation.

149
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
But all

150
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:36,640
Great Spiritual Masters of Junwu Academy

151
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:38,720
was summoned to Xuanwu Hall

152
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,520
after the Holy Sovereign fell ill.

153
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:43,000
Feng Wu is the only person
who appeared at the scene.

154
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:45,680
She is the most likely suspect.

155
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,480
Where is Feng Wu?

156
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:49,800
In the detention room.

157
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:51,880
Waiting for interrogations.

158
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:53,800
I'll ask her about it.

159
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,440
How dare you stop me?

160
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:06,680
Your Highness Jun.

161
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:09,160
I know you and Feng Wu are close.

162
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:11,120
But under these circumstances,

163
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,240
you'd better not stand up for her.

164
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:15,760
After we get to the bottom of this,

165
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,200
we can decide what to do with her.

166
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:18,520
Yeah.

167
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:21,360
Your Highness,

168
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,280
you are the heir of Junwu Clan.

169
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,080
You shoulder the responsibility
of protecting the people.

170
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,680
Please act with caution.

171
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:27,840
On the Holy Queen's order,

172
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,920
I must not let you leave.

173
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:31,560
Your Highness,

174
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:33,920
forgive me.

175
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,080
Why are you still here?

176
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,640
The Holy Queen permitted me

177
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:58,440
to stay and help you.

178
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,320
Didn't I make myself clear?

179
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:03,960
You made yourself very clear.

180
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,760
But a girl

181
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,880
is better at taking care of people.

182
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,600
If I'm that big an eyesore to you,

183
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,640
feel free to go aside and rest.

184
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,480
She murdered Dean Ning?

185
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Impossible.

186
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,200
Absolutely impossible.

187
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,320
Feng Wu would never

188
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,440
do such a thing.

189
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,120
We all know she wouldn't do that.

190
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,200
But all the evidence points to her.

191
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:41,480
What we think doesn't matter.

192
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:44,200
Where is His Highness Jun

193
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,360
at this critical moment?

194
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,800
He is probably trapped in Junwu Divine Hall.

195
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,520
This thing involves a lot of people.

196
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,880
My grandfather and teachers

197
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:00,040
were summoned to Xuanwu Hall.

198
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,360
I haven't heard anything from them.

199
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,520
We can't just await our doom.

200
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:07,880
Take it easy.

201
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,400
We can come up with something.

202
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:10,400
We'll find a solution.

203
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,400
Where on earth is Wu?

204
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:16,480
She is held

205
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,600
in the academy's detention room.

206
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:23,480
It's said the detention room

207
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,160
is full of
charms suppressing spirit energies.

208
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,120
Feng Wu must be feeling awful

209
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,320
in there.

210
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:32,680
Young Lady.

211
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,320
Wu.

212
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:02,440
How are you?

213
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,400
What are you doing here?

214
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:06,360
What else?

215
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,560
I'm rescuing you.

216
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:09,400
I can't leave.

217
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:10,640
Leaving now

218
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:11,920
will make it harder to clear my name.

219
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:14,280
But it happened so strangely.

220
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,040
If we can't find any evidence,

221
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,040
they will no doubt pin the murder

222
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:17,880
on you.

223
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,600
It'll be too late to run then.

224
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:21,320
Anyway,

225
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,520
I just can't leave.

226
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:24,400
Why are you so stubborn?

227
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,720
Take this to Jun Linyuan.

228
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,280
You two must discuss

229
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:35,840
to clear my name.

230
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:37,920
If I leave now,

231
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,800
I'll get my mom, Qiu Ling,

232
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:41,840
and you guys

233
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,560
in trouble.

234
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:45,920
Wait for me.

235
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:10,920
Cheer up!

236
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,800
You look dispirited. It's unseemly.

237
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:14,680
Yes.

238
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,600
Someone broke into the hall.
Catch the intruder!

239
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,160
Stay here to protect the Holy Sovereign.
I'll check it out.

240
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:05,320
Stop!

241
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:11,840
Yu Mingye.

242
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:13,640
What are you doing here?

243
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,280
I came for you.

244
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:18,680
Your Highness Jun,

245
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,720
the Holy Sovereign is feeling unwell.

246
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:22,760
At this critical moment,

247
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:25,680
Darknight Court's Young Master
barged into the Divine Hall.

248
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,040
I think

249
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:29,360
he is up to no good.

250
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:40,160
He is my friend.

251
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:50,000
He broke into the Divine Hall
and hurt the guards.

252
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:53,600
You'd be better off
without a friend like him.

253
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,200
The Holy Sovereign is seriously ill

254
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,080
and the academy is struck by changes.

255
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:59,120
I must perform my duty.

256
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:00,680
Take him away.

257
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:01,760
Wait.

258
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:05,520
Your Majesty.

259
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:06,480
You are awake.

260
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:07,600
How are you feeling?

261
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:09,280
I had a good sleep.

262
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:10,920
Now I'm feeling much better.

263
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:16,080
I was lucky that the Crown Prince
and Qingluan took care of me.

264
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:17,360
It's my duty.

265
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:22,440
You said

266
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:24,040
he

267
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,400
was your friend?

268
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:32,480
Yes.

269
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:38,600
Good.

270
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,120
Good.

271
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,280
You finally have a friend

272
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:47,480
other than Xuan Yi and Feng Xun.

273
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:50,040
Good.

274
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:52,720
Though Darknight Court's cultivation method

275
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,240
runs counter to

276
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,520
Junwu Clan's cultivation method,

277
00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:00,200
he barged into the hall to see you.

278
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:03,200
It proves the unusual nature

279
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,520
of your friendship.

280
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,040
Very well.

281
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:11,760
I'm alright now.

282
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:14,000
You may go.

283
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:15,200
Your Majesty.

284
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:18,920
Thank you, Your Majesty.

285
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:38,480
Congratulations on your recovery.

286
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,560
I'll report to the Holy Queen right now.

287
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,200
Have you heard?

288
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,480
Dean Ning has been murdered.

289
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:55,920
And the murderer is Feng Wu.

290
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:56,680
Gosh.

291
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:58,600
I can't believe she is such a lunatic.

292
00:16:58,920 --> 00:16:59,640
Yeah.

293
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,160
What are you babbling about?

294
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,800
You have no evidence. Don't start rumors.

295
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,560
The whole academy knows about it.
It must be true.

296
00:17:06,110 --> 00:17:06,540
She is the reason that

297
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:07,800
our classes are suspended
and we are waiting until further notice.

298
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:09,240
We can't even go home.

299
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:17,680
You must be the person

300
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:18,830
who spread the rumor
that Feng Wu is the murderer.

301
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,110
Don't accuse people
when you have no evidence.

302
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,000
You're so eager to defend Feng Wu?

303
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:23,880
Why?

304
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:26,070
Are you her accomplice?

305
00:17:26,070 --> 00:17:26,560
You...

306
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:28,000
Don't waste your breath on her.

307
00:17:28,350 --> 00:17:29,080
Let's go.

308
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:40,320
You just said we were friends.

309
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:41,520
Did I hear it wrong?

310
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,400
Can you please forget it? I'm feeling sick.

311
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,680
If not for Feng Wu's sake,

312
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,160
I would have ordered them to catch you.

313
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:52,360
Now you show your true colors, you hypocrite.

314
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,400
What's your plan?

315
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,360
You end up seeking my help.

316
00:17:58,800 --> 00:17:59,960
I have a plan.

317
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:01,920
But I need your cooperation.

318
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:20,640
Dean Ning

319
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,560
was an outstanding cultivator of Junwu Clan
when he was young.

320
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:23,760
How could this happen?

321
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:27,560
I heard that someone attempted to
poison the Holy Sovereign.

322
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:28,320
What?

323
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:30,240
If this goes on,

324
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,880
Junwu Clan's foundation will be shaken.

325
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:34,360
Yeah.

326
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:39,720
Folks,

327
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:40,720
I came with good news.

328
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,320
Dean Ning has revived.

329
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:44,520
How is Dean Ning?

330
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,800
Dean Ning is resting to
recuperate in Wenyuan Pavilion.

331
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:48,200
After he wakes up,

332
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:50,120
the truth will surface.

333
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,680
Don't disturb Dean Ning these days.

334
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,240
Good to know he survived.

335
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:10,080
The Dean was severely wounded.

336
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,920
But fortunately,
his vital organs weren't hurt.

337
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:14,360
Let him rest for a few days
and he'll wake up.

338
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:15,320
Thank you, doctor.

339
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:46,880
I can't believe your petty tricks

340
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:47,800
actually worked.

341
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:48,800
Of course.

342
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,840
When the murderer learned that
his target survived,

343
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:54,120
he would come here to deliver the final blow.

344
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,720
It's a widely known fact about fighting.

345
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:57,120
You don't even know that?

346
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,280
I can teach you if you want to learn.

347
00:19:58,360 --> 00:19:59,400
Enough.

348
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:07,120
Seize him.

349
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,200
Darknight Court's move.

350
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:29,920
Fire Wielding Spell.

351
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:34,560
Watch out.

352
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,080
Celestial Palace's move.

353
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,120
Who are you?

354
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:58,760
This guy is just powerful.

355
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,400
We are no match for him unless we unite.

356
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:44,560
Supervisor Wu.

357
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:51,680
What happened?

358
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:00,120
Now

359
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:01,920
I'm done keeping secrets.

360
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:03,320
That's right.

361
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:05,440
I killed Dean Ning.

362
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:08,800
I'll give an explanation

363
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:11,440
to Junwu Academy.

364
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:12,880
What do you want?

365
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:16,000
Bring Feng Wu to Library Pavilion to meet me.

366
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,560
I need to talk to her.

367
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:18,920
Feng Wu?

368
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:21,320
I knew Feng Wu was your accomplice.

369
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:33,640
Old Man Wu.

370
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,600
What are you doing now?

371
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:38,040
Get out.

372
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:41,040
Have you brought Feng Wu here?

373
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:55,320
Are you okay?

374
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:00,960
We don't know what it is like inside.

375
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:02,240
I'll enter Library Pavilion instead of you.

376
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:04,080
He only wanted to see me.

377
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:06,840
You must not go.

378
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:11,720
Supervisor Wu.

379
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:13,040
I'm here.

380
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:14,760
Release the hostage.

381
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:24,400
Wu Youdao,

382
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,680
you are not getting out alive.

383
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:27,920
Guards,

384
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,120
get in there!

385
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:30,600
No!

386
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:33,560
All the books written in the past century

387
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:36,120
are stored in Library Pavilion.

388
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:37,640
If you storm Library Pavilion,

389
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:39,680
the books will be damaged.

390
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,480
What do you think

391
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:43,760
we should do?

392
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:49,440
We'll depend on Miss Feng Wu for now.

393
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:58,000
Supervisor Wu,

394
00:23:58,560 --> 00:23:59,480
I won't bring any weapons.

395
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:02,000
Can I enter Library Pavilion with Feng Wu?

396
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:04,040
Crown Prince of Junwu Clan,

397
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,480
you are of high status.

398
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:07,560
Don't you worry this might be my trap?

399
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:08,720
I don't care.

400
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:11,640
I'm going with you.

401
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:15,040
I'm going too.

402
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:17,380
It's unnecessary
for Darknight Court's Young Master

403
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:18,600
to come up here.

404
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:21,400
If His Highness Jun is worried about Feng Wu,

405
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,480
he may come up here with Feng Wu.

406
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:25,200
Your Highness Jun.

407
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:26,440
Your Highness.

408
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,040
It has been 35 years.

409
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:05,480
Yunniang.

410
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:07,840
All this

411
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:10,480
is finally coming to a close.

412
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:12,800
Supervisor Wu,

413
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:15,640
what is all this about?

414
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,560
Her hair white, her dress black, the goddess

415
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:35,080
does an ethereal sword dance,
her form as light as a leaf.

416
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:38,600
The poem in the painting

417
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:40,440
refers to the only female teacher
of Junwu Academy,

418
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:41,760
Sima Yunniang.

419
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:44,040
She is my first sword fighting teacher.

420
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:45,040
I remember her.

421
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:51,040
I see you hold your friends dear.

422
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:54,600
Stop beating around the bush.

423
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:55,880
You couldn't have called us here

424
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:58,240
to appreciate a painting and poem with you.

425
00:25:58,640 --> 00:25:59,520
Supervisor Wu,

426
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:03,120
did you kill Dean Ning or not?

427
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:10,640
Do you want to

428
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:12,880
talk about Sima Yunniang?

429
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,760
You are smart.

430
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:18,720
Feng Wu,

431
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:20,440
you

432
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:23,200
are impatient.

433
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:09,480
That's right.

434
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:12,520
I killed Ning Shien.

435
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:16,240
I'd dreamed of killing him for tens of years.

436
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,880
I refrained for most of my life.

437
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:22,120
Then I finally had my chance.

438
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:23,560
Last night,

439
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:26,800
he entered Library Pavilion alone

440
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:29,280
to consult medical books
for the Holy Sovereign.

441
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:39,080
After all these years,

442
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:43,600
you still haven't moved on.

443
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:50,080
Old Man Wu!

444
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:51,920
Old Man Wu!

445
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,760
35 years have gone by.

446
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:01,520
He held no regard

447
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:03,480
for what he had done.

448
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:06,680
He took everything from me

449
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:09,760
and asked me why I hadn't moved on.

450
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:12,880
What kind of feud

451
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:15,040
did you have with Dean Ning?

452
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:20,040
Yunniang once gave you
sword fighting lessons.

453
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:24,280
I'm sure you know what happened to her.

454
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,440
Her opinions disagreed
with those of the academy.

455
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:33,800
So she resigned
and came to cultivate at Library Pavilion.

456
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:34,840
Ten years ago,

457
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:36,880
a big fire in Library Pavilion

458
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:38,560
took her life.

459
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:44,860
Yunniang punished the evil
and wicked creatures

460
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:46,600
and pursued her studies all her life.

461
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,160
In the end, she died a miserable death

462
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:54,200
in Junwu Academy.

463
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:58,320
Her corpse was never found.

464
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:03,480
It seems that Supervisor Wu had an unusual relationship

465
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:04,800
with your first sword fighting teacher.

466
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:06,120
What does all this

467
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:07,400
have to do with Dean Ning?

468
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,360
What if I tell you

469
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:13,120
the Dean's position

470
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:15,400
originally belonged to me?

471
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:17,120
You...

472
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:24,120
The invitation letter was meant for me.

473
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:27,080
I should have been the Dean of Junwu Academy.

474
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:29,960
I've always been willing to trust you
with my life.

475
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:32,560
How could you do this to me?

476
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:33,960
Youdao,

477
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:36,000
I know you are upset.

478
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:37,880
But think about it. You have no background.

479
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:38,940
There are so many cultivators

480
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:41,040
from prestigious families
at Junwu Academy.

481
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,760
They would never respect you.

482
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:44,920
We finally had the chance

483
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,240
to realize our long-time dream.

484
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:49,520
I didn't want our efforts to be wasted.

485
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:55,320
You make it sound so decent.

486
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:56,800
Fine.

487
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:58,640
I'd like to see

488
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:00,680
if you can keep your Dean's position

489
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:02,680
after I disclose

490
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,960
the truth.

491
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:06,320
If you do that,

492
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:07,600
our long-time dream

493
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:08,920
will never be realized.

494
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:09,640
Let's go there.

495
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:10,200
-Okay.
-Okay.

496
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:16,400
I hold a position in Junwu Clan.

497
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:18,460
Let's have a rest.

498
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:20,640
You may not want to admit it,

499
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,520
but it's my advantage.

500
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:24,680
My position

501
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:26,560
granted me the opportunity

502
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:30,080
to make Yunniang
the first-ever female teacher

503
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:31,680
of Junwu Academy.

504
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,920
You know it's what she had always wanted.

505
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:35,160
If you were the Dean,

506
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,600
could you do the same?

507
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:42,200
Youdao,

508
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:44,520
I know it's unfair for you.

509
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:46,160
I beg you to stay

510
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:47,800
and join me

511
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:50,760
in helping the young people
realize their dreams

512
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:53,400
and protecting more civilians.

513
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:06,320
Then

514
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:09,560
I declined his offer.

515
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,200
I didn't even say goodbye to Yunniang.

516
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:16,720
I adventured on Qianyuan Continent alone.

517
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:20,040
One day, I found Mu Jiuzhou's manuscript

518
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:23,960
by chance.

519
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:26,120
The manuscript contained detailed records

520
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:28,360
of the spells and moves of all sects.

521
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:30,520
Then

522
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:32,760
I took great pains to cultivate

523
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:35,640
and became a legend on Qianyuan Continent.

524
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:41,080
I revisited this place many years later,

525
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:45,240
only found myself furious
and eager to take revenge.

526
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:47,800
You hate Dean Ning.

527
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,280
You hate Junwu Academy.

528
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:52,320
You hate Junwu Clan.

529
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:55,560
You poisoned the Holy Sovereign.

530
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:57,200
He didn't do that.

531
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:01,640
He could do a sucker-punch

532
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:02,880
to someone.

533
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:05,200
But he would never

534
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:06,920
poison an innocent person.

535
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:10,080
From what I know about him,

536
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:13,400
he is cunning,

537
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:15,000
but he is not vicious.

538
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,600
I launched a sneak attack.

539
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:23,280
Isn't that vicious?

540
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:24,960
Stop acting like

541
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:26,360
a nefarious monster.

542
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:29,760
Do you want to be wronged?

543
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:32,120
Supervisor Wu,

544
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:34,080
what is done is done

545
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:36,160
and it doesn't look like you want to flee,

546
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:37,960
you might as well get down with us.

547
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:39,600
Maybe

548
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:41,440
the Holy Sovereign and the academy

549
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:42,840
will forgive and pardon you.

550
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:44,320
Forgive?

551
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,800
Why would I want them to forgive me?

552
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:49,680
Don't you want to know

553
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:51,880
why I summoned

554
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:53,680
you here?

555
00:32:57,560 --> 00:33:01,480
Feng Wu is Mu Jiuzhou's disciple.

556
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:04,280
She is basically my schoolmate.

557
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:43,360
I got a favor and learned from him.

558
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,280
I wouldn't hurt his disciples.

559
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:49,320
So you knew all along.

560
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:51,960
Master asked me

561
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:53,560
not to tell anyone about this.

562
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:00,640
Crown Prince value friendship

563
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:03,600
and you are also Yunniang's student.

564
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:06,280
I also wouldn't hurt you

565
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:10,960
Fate plays cruel jokes on people.

566
00:34:11,230 --> 00:34:14,840
Today is the anniversary of Yunniang's death.

567
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:19,040
It's time to end all this.

568
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,120
I cast a spell on the secret chamber.

569
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:31,670
You can't use your spirit energy down there.

570
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,190
I hope you'll be found

571
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,600
after the dust settles.

572
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:45,190
What is taking them so long?

573
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:00,400
Old Man Wu.

574
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:05,480
I'm going to destroy

575
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:08,680
Junwu Academy.

576
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:13,400
If you are innocent, go away.

577
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:15,320
Don't try to stop me.

578
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:17,040
Junwu Academy

579
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:19,960
is the den of death.

580
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:25,920
Yunniang,

581
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:28,640
all this will end soon.

582
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,560
After I destroy this place,

583
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,000
I'll keep you company in the netherworld.

584
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:35,560
Seize him!

585
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:19,920
Go away.

586
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:25,840
Old Man Wu,

587
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:28,120
don't let your hatred control you.

588
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:29,560
Stop now.

589
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:31,080
Your mistakes are still redeemable.

590
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:33,160
Old Man Fang, don't try to talk me around.

591
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:35,360
I have made up my mind.

592
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,600
I really can't use my spirit energy here.

593
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:05,720
How come Library Pavilion
has a chamber like this?

594
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:06,640
It's said

595
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:08,680
Master Mu created
a secret cultivation chamber

596
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,240
for himself when he was

597
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:13,480
starting Junwu Academy.

598
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:15,760
Can this be his secret chamber?

599
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,360
Why are you staring at me?

600
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:27,560
We must hurry up and find an exit

601
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:29,040
in order to stop Old Man Wu.

602
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:55,640
So, you are really Master Mu's disciple?

603
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:59,080
Kind of.

604
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:03,240
Why didn't you tell me?

605
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:06,080
If people knew

606
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:07,520
someone untalented like me

607
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:09,320
was Master Mu's disciple,

608
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:11,680
his reputation would be damaged.

609
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:13,560
So you did all this

610
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:16,320
to wake up Master Mu.

611
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:19,880
Yes.

612
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:22,240
I wanted to tell you.

613
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:23,920
But I feared I'd cause greater trouble

614
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:25,600
if I didn't explain things well.

615
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:27,600
Do you blame me?

616
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:29,000
Of course not.

617
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:33,080
Some time ago,
I noticed that someone attempted

618
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:35,520
to make trouble
when the energy barrier was damaged.

619
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:38,080
I could only do my best
to bring the situation under control.

620
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:40,160
I didn't know how to solve the real problem.

621
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:43,240
Master Mu established the energy barrier.

622
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:44,160
I think the only way

623
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:46,200
to mend the energy barrier

624
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:48,840
is waking up Master Mu.

625
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:49,880
For that purpose,

626
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,000
I'll help you

627
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:53,200
wake up Master Mu.

628
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:54,640
Your help

629
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:55,920
is certainly welcomed.

630
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:57,680
Let's get back to looking for an exit.

631
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:59,880
This chamber is definitely built
with machinery that can get us out.

632
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:33,760
This...

633
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:35,480
Look.

634
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:54,760
It's Master.

635
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:02,000
This...

636
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:03,720
