2
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:40,460
(Episode 13)

3
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,160
This is Heart-eroding Maze aimed at you.

4
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,040
Lower your head.

5
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,840
You should give up now.

6
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,520
I only want Heavenly Heart Pistil.

7
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,120
I'll leave as long as

8
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,280
I get it.

9
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:06,240
I'm not consulting with you.

10
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:07,960
Go now

11
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:10,280
or stay forever.

12
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,400
Think twice before you speak.

13
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:14,880
I don't have the time to waste on you.

14
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:31,040
I only want Heavenly Heart Pistil.

15
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:32,920
It's my promise.

16
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,200
You employ trickery

17
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:38,680
and attempt to buy people's support.

18
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:41,600
How dare you claim to be Peerless Tower?

19
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,320
Ridiculous.

20
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,920
It looks like we won't get on the same page.

21
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:48,120
Since you want to die,

22
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,760
I won't go easy on you.

23
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:53,920
Get rid of her quickly.

24
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:04,880
Shadow Swordsman.

25
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,560
How is your sick daughter doing?

26
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,760
I heard that herbal decoctions
are the only things keeping her alive.

27
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,800
Expensive medicines

28
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,520
are sent to her in large amounts.

29
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,240
What do you think the reason is?

30
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:21,080
If you don't listen to me,

31
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,080
you will not end well.

32
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:25,480
Cultivators aren't that big a deal.

33
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,160
Everything in this world

34
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,520
can be bought with money.

35
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:47,000
Tell me which is more important,

36
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,640
your money or your life?

37
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:00,520
Young Master.

38
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,120
Where is Lord Demon?

39
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,080
I pay respect to you, My Lord.

40
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,800
What brought you to the capital suddenly?

41
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:44,800
I didn't know you were coming.

42
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,920
You knew I was coming all along.

43
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,840
I have a task

44
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:06,840
for you.

45
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:13,300
(Peerless Tower)

46
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:16,320
It's getting dark and Feng Wu
still hasn't come out.

47
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,560
Will she be alright?

48
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,560
Fortune favors Young Lady.

49
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:21,840
She will be alright.

50
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,360
Yes. Yes.

51
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,600
She will be alright.

52
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,240
The Heart-eroding Maze was powerful.

53
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:39,480
You need two hours

54
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:40,840
to recover completely.

55
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,360
Why are you here?

56
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:45,400
I...

57
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,480
I just dropped by

58
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:49,600
on my way to another place.

59
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,080
I don't think so.

60
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,040
By the way,

61
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:02,360
how did you know I was at Peerless Tower?

62
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,680
Did you take this huge risk

63
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:10,120
to increase your spirit energy?

64
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,320
No.

65
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:13,840
I came to obtain the cure
for my friend Zhao Ge.

66
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,440
You're overthinking it.

67
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:21,800
Well,

68
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,920
since you rushed here,

69
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,440
I will let what happened last time

70
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:27,840
pass.

71
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,280
You deserve these things.

72
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,000
Take them.

73
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,480
You went through all the trouble

74
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,320
for these things, didn't you?

75
00:06:58,740 --> 00:06:59,860
(Qinglingsan Score)

76
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,560
What is this?

77
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,480
The only existing copy of the Score.

78
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,200
I don't know music theory.

79
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,040
It's a pity that I have it.

80
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,520
The Heavenly Heart Pistil.

81
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:37,240
Shadow Swordsman, I'm sorry.

82
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,640
Your daughter

83
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:40,560
must need this too.

84
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:44,080
My daughter no longer needs it.

85
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,600
My daughter passed away

86
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,680
half a month ago.

87
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,640
She said the same thing as you.

88
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:00,400
She said,

89
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:02,040
"Father,

90
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:04,720
this is a big world.

91
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:07,400
Why do you want to

92
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,160
spend a lifetime in this Peerless Tower?"

93
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,000
She didn't tell me

94
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,760
that she poured all the medicines away.

95
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:29,080
It's okay.

96
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:31,920
I have decided

97
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:33,600
to travel around

98
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,440
the Continent

99
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:37,280
for her.

100
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,880
I hope you will get what you want

101
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,910
in a vast world

102
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,840
and bring new meaning into your life.

103
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,440
Feng Wu.

104
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,160
My Lady.

105
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:54,880
Are you okay?

106
00:08:58,760 --> 00:08:59,360
Feng Wu.

107
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,000
Mom, I did it.

108
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,280
It's good to see you safe.

109
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,320
Wu, you finally got out.

110
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:07,040
I was so scared.

111
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,720
Zhao Ge, I obtained the cure.

112
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:25,000
Thank you, Wu.

113
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,800
Spiritual Elder Fang, are you okay?

114
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:00,800
Go after him!

115
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:01,800
Yes.

116
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:06,840
Who is

117
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,800
that person?

118
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,360
How is your friend?

119
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,360
She has ingested the Heavenly Heart Pistil

120
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:30,600
and fallen asleep.

121
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,160
Thank you

122
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:46,720
for what happened today.

123
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,240
You no longer blame me?

124
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,200
I have thought it over.

125
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:55,200
I was being too extreme.

126
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,240
I know you wanted what's best for me.

127
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,680
You wanted me to improve.

128
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,640
But if we let this stop us

129
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,360
from getting together,

130
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,640
then future hardships...

131
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:05,240
Stop it.

132
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,360
I should have told you sooner.

133
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,120
I don't care about

134
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,400
matched backgrounds.

135
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:14,640
I only care about

136
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,320
you.

137
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,960
If you knew I'm not Feng Wu,

138
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,640
would you treat me so well?

139
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:05,080
Waiter, two jugs of wine for me.

140
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:05,760
Yes.

141
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:26,040
I thought the female disciples
of Celestial Palace are self-disciplined.

142
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:28,400
How come you are indulging in wine?

143
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:32,680
Your wine.

144
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,480
As it happens, I'm feeling blue.

145
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,240
Let's drink together.

146
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,840
It's no fun drinking from small cups.

147
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:51,360
What could upset

148
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,640
the Young Master of Darknight Court?

149
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,760
You know me?

150
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:02,200
I have heard a lot about you.

151
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:06,360
The Goddess of Celestial Palace
also has troubles.

152
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:10,680
You know me?

153
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,120
I know every good fighter

154
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,880
on Qianyuan Continent,

155
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:15,640
not to mention the fact that

156
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,880
you stand out from the younger generation.

157
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:22,200
Nice to meet you.

158
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,160
Since you are displeased

159
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,720
and I'm troubled,

160
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:28,000
let's not bother

161
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,440
each other with questions

162
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:31,400
and just seek solace in wine.

163
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:34,240
Alright.

164
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:39,480
Young Master,

165
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:42,040
why would you drink wine
when you are injured?

166
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:43,920
It's fine.

167
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,280
Just a small injury.

168
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,440
Too bad there were so many guards.

169
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,040
Slow down.

170
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,480
I failed.

171
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,840
I underestimated the enemy.

172
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:55,400
Young Master, stop thinking about it.

173
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:57,080
Let's go back and get you some medicines.

174
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,520
Don't let Lord Demon know about this.

175
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:03,000
I will find a chance

176
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,520
to try again.

177
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:06,320
Yes.

178
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:07,600
Come on.

179
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:09,640
Slow down.

180
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:11,080
Slow down.

181
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:18,920
Zhao Ge.

182
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:20,480
Open your eyes and look.

183
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:30,880
I...

184
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:36,760
I...

185
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,720
How did I...

186
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:48,520
Wu.

187
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:50,360
Thank you.

188
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:53,080
Alright. Don't cry.

189
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,880
If you cry, you won't be a little fatty,

190
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,200
but will be a crybaby.

191
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,520
Alright.

192
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:00,520
From now on,

193
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:02,120
nobody will mock you again.

194
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,320
Look at me. Am I beautiful?

195
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:10,080
Yes.

196
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:22,720
Good morning, Qiu Ling.

197
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,320
Miss Zhao Ge.

198
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:28,520
You...

199
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:31,320
You lost so much weight.

200
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:34,000
Yeah. Look at me.

201
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,160
How do I look?

202
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:39,040
You are so pretty.

203
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:50,120
Qiu Ling.

204
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:51,160
Go about your work.

205
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:53,480
I will have a new dress tailored.

206
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:00,880
The Heavenly Heart Pistil

207
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,880
really worked wonder.

208
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,520
Sixth Young Lady.

209
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,280
Go. Check that place.

210
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:20,320
Yes.

211
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,360
Have you checked this place?

212
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:27,520
Don't yell.

213
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:29,000
If they see us together,

214
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:31,800
we won't be able to explain our relationship.

215
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:35,720
You...

216
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,280
What are you doing here?

217
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,760
We just saw a dark figure heading that way.

218
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:40,720
Did you see?

219
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:41,840
No.

220
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,040
Liar.

221
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:44,200
It went in there.

222
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:44,800
Make way.

223
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,360
What are you doing?

224
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:48,840
Sixth Young Lady.

225
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:51,680
What are you doing?

226
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,440
Who says you could come in?

227
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:55,560
Sixth Young Lady,

228
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,640
this is My Lady's room.

229
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,240
You can't just barge in.

230
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:00,800
Fifth Young Lady, we are sorry.

231
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:03,480
A thief has snuck into the mansion.
This is our next place to search.

232
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,520
It's only natural to try and catch the thief.

233
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:06,920
Why can't we take a look here?

234
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,840
I want a thorough search to be carried out.

235
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,560
Don't push your luck.

236
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,350
The thief you are looking for is not here.

237
00:17:18,830 --> 00:17:19,590
Get out.

238
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:29,160
What?

239
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:30,800
You want me to throw you out?

240
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,000
You...

241
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:41,200
You...

242
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,480
Don't assume your success
at Peerless Tower

243
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:44,240
is a big deal.

244
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,920
You show-off.

245
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,120
The higher you climb, the heavier you fall.

246
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:49,560
Let's go.

247
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:54,240
Qiu Ling.

248
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,360
Make some food for me.

249
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:08,440
Come out.

250
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:17,360
Does Feng Liu always pick on you?

251
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:18,800
Do you need me to teach her a lesson?

252
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:20,320
No.

253
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,720
What brought

254
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,040
you here?

255
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:26,440
I just missed you.

256
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:27,840
So I came to see you.

257
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,360
Can you please enter the mansion
through the front gate next time?

258
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:34,560
You are the Young Master
of Darknight Court, after all.

259
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,480
Don't be a thief

260
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:37,880
when you can come in.

261
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:42,120
It's not the first time I've done this.

262
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,360
Just get used to it.

263
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:44,800
Besides,

264
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,600
if I come in through the front gate,

265
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:48,120
other people will know

266
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:49,840
you and I have close contacts.

267
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:54,200
Other people might say
you and Darknight Court...

268
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:57,960
So what?

269
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:59,800
I know people will talk,

270
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:01,120
but

271
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:03,040
I have a clear conscience.

272
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:04,600
Besides,

273
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:05,800
what's so bad about Darknight Court?

274
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:09,000
There are cultivators at Darknight Court,

275
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:11,000
such as you, who look a little scary,

276
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:15,000
but are not rude or ruthless.

277
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:19,600
And you are not bad.

278
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,880
You just tend to resort to extreme means

279
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,400
and do as you wish.

280
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:29,720
Yu Mingye.

281
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,160
Do you really approve of

282
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:34,240
Darknight Court's approach?

283
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:42,680
I was born there.

284
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:43,920
I grew up there.

285
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:47,000
Darknight Court's approach

286
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:49,320
has seeped into my brain.

287
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:51,360
Power.

288
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:52,720
Honor.

289
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:54,320
Plunder.

290
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,720
I was born with all these traits.

291
00:19:58,600 --> 00:19:59,160
I...

292
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,160
You simply dare not choose

293
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:02,680
and have no choice.

294
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:09,720
By the way,

295
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:11,520
don't think I haven't heard about

296
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,440
the nonsense you told my mother.

297
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,560
The man who will marry the Lady

298
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:16,360
is you, right?

299
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,040
I didn't hit you that hard.

300
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,280
Are you okay?

301
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:24,720
I'm fine.

302
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,160
I was playing with you.

303
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:28,080
You weren't injured yesterday, were you?

304
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,960
I wanted to go there and have a look.

305
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,160
But I suddenly had things to do.

306
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:34,920
I was alright.

307
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:36,960
Yesterday was nothing but a scare.

308
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:39,120
Anyway, thank you for your silk pouch.

309
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:41,560
By the way,

310
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:47,320
this is my honorarium for you.

311
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:50,740
(Qinglingsan Score)

312
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:54,840
It's the treasure Qinglingsan Score.

313
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:56,840
Are you really giving it to me?

314
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:59,960
It's of no use to me.

315
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:01,280
You can have it

316
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,160
and make the best use of it.

317
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:05,400
Thanks.

318
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,360
I will take it

319
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:10,480
and think of it as your birthday gift for me.

320
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,240
Birthday gift?

321
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:14,160
Today is your birthday?

322
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:17,840
Nobody has ever

323
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,480
celebrated my birthday.

324
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:21,360
I have grown used to it.

325
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,280
In the best scenario,
I won't kill anyone on my birthday

326
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:24,640
to celebrate it.

327
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:30,200
Feng Wu.

328
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,320
I hope

329
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:36,160
you will celebrate my birthday every year.

330
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:37,160
Will you?

331
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:38,960
Err...

332
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:42,480
Don't think too much.

333
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,640
I didn't mean it that way.

334
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:45,240
I...

335
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:50,800
Your maid is coming back.

336
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:51,960
I need to go.

337
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:52,800
If you need anything,

338
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:54,920
leave a message for me at
Zhang's noodle stall in the east of the city.

339
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:07,480
Can you give me a heads-up

340
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:09,040
the next time you summon me?

341
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:10,240
You always catch me unprepared.

342
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:11,480
Where has

343
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:13,160
that man been?

344
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,120
How do I know?

345
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,600
He carries the spirit essence

346
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:20,640
of the Star Shard we need.

347
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:22,000
The Star Shard?

348
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:22,760
Yes.

349
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:30,040
The Star Shard is a collection
of worldly essences.

350
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,880
Its true form is Junwu Clan's

351
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:35,120
legendary divine artifact
Soul Evocation Lantern.

352
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:37,160
When the world was thrown into turmoil,

353
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:39,120
the divine artifact broke into three pieces

354
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:41,640
which scattered and became lost.

355
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:42,320
What happened after that?

356
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:44,400
If you find the three pieces

357
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:45,840
and collect the worldly essences,

358
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:48,040
your master will wake up.

359
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:49,640
Really?

360
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:50,560
Then

361
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:51,840
what does it look like?

362
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:53,120
Where can I find it?

363
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,680
The Star Shard can take the form of anything.

364
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:56,760
Nobody knows

365
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:58,800
what its fixed form is.

366
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:02,320
Some spirit animals
can sense a faint trace of the essence.

367
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:04,560
The man you met with

368
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:07,360
must have touched the Star Shard recently.

369
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:10,920
You might as well
follow the lead and start investigating.

370
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,520
Yu Mingye.

371
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,360
The Star Shard.

372
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:21,600
Are you sure it was Yu Mingye?

373
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:22,640
I'm absolutely sure.

374
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:23,520
Yesterday,

375
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:25,200
my grandfather talked to
Great Spiritual Master Yan

376
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,040
at Yan's Mansion

377
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:27,160
and witnessed the whole incident.

378
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:28,840
My grandfather offered timely help

379
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:30,120
to ensure he returned empty-handed.

380
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,080
The man

381
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:33,000
displayed Darknight Court's
techniques and style.

382
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:33,880
And

383
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:35,240
he was powerful enough

384
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:36,760
to against my grandfather.

385
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,120
He must be Yu Mingye.

386
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:41,760
My grandfather believed
something strange was going on

387
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:43,480
and dared not disclose the incident.

388
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:44,760
He told me to consult you.

389
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:47,400
Do you know Yu Mingye's motive?

390
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:52,000
I heard that he was after
Water Sky Vase

391
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:53,680
made by a master craftsman.

392
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:57,120
The vase is Great Spiritual Master Yan's
family heirloom.

393
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,840
It has been stored in his Treasury Building.

394
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,800
Yu Mingye must have been found

395
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:01,600
the moment he laid his hands on the vase.

396
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:02,880
So he returned empty-handed.

397
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:05,480
My grandfather entered the Treasury Building
and checked the vase.

398
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:08,280
He said there was nothing special
about the vase

399
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:10,120
except that
it was especially precious and old.

400
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:13,920
A vase.

401
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:16,160
Yu Mingye

402
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:18,520
likes to play music

403
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:19,640
and pose as a lover of culture.

404
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:22,200
But he wouldn't risk his life

405
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,320
for a vase.

406
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:24,520
There must be something wrong

407
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:26,480
with the whole thing.

408
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,520
Where did he go afterward?

409
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:31,760
The injured Yu Mingye

410
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
still had cards up his sleeve.

411
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,920
The servants of the Yan's Mansion
lost track of him.

412
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:36,000
He just disappeared.

413
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:53,120
He wants Water Sky Vase

414
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:54,560
for Wu Youdao.

415
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:57,440
-Wu Youdao?
-Wu Youdao?

416
00:24:58,680 --> 00:24:59,360
That's right.

417
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:01,520
Wu Youdao.

418
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:04,240
You mean the Ageless Child,

419
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:05,360
Wu Youdao?

420
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:10,160
Wu Youdao is a close friend to Ning Shien.

421
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,200
Ning Shien loves swords.

422
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,920
Wu Youdao loves calligraphic works,
paintings and antiques.

423
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:18,280
He has been looking for
Water Sky Vase for many years.

424
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,440
It'd be best to give him the vase

425
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,360
as a gift at our first meeting.

426
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:25,360
Ning Shien.

427
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,960
Dean Ning of Junwu Academy?

428
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:33,880
They have known each other for many years.

429
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:36,360
And their cultivation bases
are similarly strong.

430
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,080
But Ning Shien

431
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:40,080
came from Junwu Clan

432
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,200
while Wu Youdao

433
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:45,040
never joined any sect

434
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:46,760
and cultivated without a teacher.

435
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:49,480
His cultivation base and spirit energy
grow in his unique way.

436
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:53,160
He is admired by
numerous civilians and cultivators.

437
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:55,080
Over the years,

438
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:56,760
many people have tried to find out

439
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:58,720
how he grows his cultivation base.

440
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:02,000
But nobody found out anything.

441
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:03,640
As far as I know,

442
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,680
the Ageless Child has drifted about
and traveled around the world

443
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:07,680
over the past tens of years.

444
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:09,960
How are we going to give him

445
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,320
Water Sky Vase?

446
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:16,280
Junwu Academy has hired him
as the Supervisor.

447
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,560
He will return to the capital soon.

448
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:19,960
So,

449
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:23,040
you wish to woo Wu Youdao

450
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,200
and make him help us.

451
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:28,560
If we know how he grows his cultivation base,

452
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:31,880
Darknight Court
will be greatly strengthened

453
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:33,640
and dominate Qianyuan Continent.

454
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:40,360
I have failed to complete
such an important task.

455
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:41,560
I'm incompetent.

456
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:42,960
Please punish me, My Lord.

457
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:44,400
Forget it.

458
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:48,440
It wasn't the perfect time

459
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:51,760
to seize
Water Sky Vase anyway.

460
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:53,880
I will enter Yan's Mansion again

461
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:55,320
to seize Water Sky Vase.

462
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:18,520
If a master cultivator like Wu Youdao

463
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,960
serves Darknight Court,

464
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:24,240
who knows how much trouble will occur.

465
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:28,200
Boss Jun,

466
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:30,440
Junwu Academy has hired Wu Youdao already.

467
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:32,080
Do you think he will change his mind

468
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:33,880
and associate with a demonic cult
like Darknight Court?

469
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:35,000
People

470
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,280
are the hardest thing to understand,

471
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:39,880
not to mention Wu Youdao,

472
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:41,640
a self-taught cultivator.

473
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:43,400
In that case,

474
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:45,680
we must not let Yu Mingye succeed.

475
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:47,120
We must get

476
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:49,440
the vase.

477
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:51,680
Wu Youdao will
arrive in the capital a few days later.

478
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:53,560
I'm sure Yu Mingye can't wait for a few days.

479
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:55,000
Let's split up and take action.

480
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:56,160
I will visit Yan's Mansion.

481
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:57,040
One of you

482
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:59,120
will follow Yu Mingye

483
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:00,200
and the other one of you

484
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,240
will investigate Wu Youdao's background.

485
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:02,960
Yes.

486
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:09,560
Be careful.

487
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,600
Don't damage my stuff.

488
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:24,040
Where is Yu Mingye?

489
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:25,440
I just saw him.

490
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:27,520
Feng Wu.

491
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:30,040
Why are you here?

492
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:31,040
I...

493
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,040
Are you following Yu Mingye?

494
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:37,960
How... how do you know?

495
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:41,680
Are you doing the same?

496
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,200
He looked suspicious.

497
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:46,360
So I followed him.

498
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:49,120
You shouldn't do this. He is not a good guy.

499
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:50,160
Get away from him.

500
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:51,560
Stay out of this.

501
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:53,240
No.

502
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:54,600
If this is a serious matter,

503
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:56,160
I want to help.

504
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:57,840
It has nothing to do with you.

505
00:29:58,120 --> 00:29:59,280
Go home.

506
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:01,760
I'm not listening to you.

507
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:03,240
If you don't tell me,

508
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:04,680
I will go to Xuan Yi.

509
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:06,960
He has always been reliable.

510
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:08,160
And

511
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:11,000
he must know more than you.

512
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:11,880
No. No. No.

513
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:16,000
Boss Jun gave us the task.

514
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:17,680
I can't tell you.

515
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:19,320
You aren't telling?

516
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:20,600
Fine.

517
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:21,800
I will ask Xuan Yi.

518
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:23,000
By then,

519
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:24,240
I will tell Jun Linyuan

520
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:25,840
you lost track of Yu Mingye

521
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:29,160
I will watch you lose face in front of them.

522
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:29,880
No. No. No.

523
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:31,480
I'm telling.

524
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:32,920
I'm telling you, okay?

525
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:34,520
Go on.

526
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:41,320
That's what happened.

527
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:42,720
You must keep this to yourself.

528
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:48,160
It turns out

529
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:51,480
Yu Mingye wants something
from the Great Spiritual Master Yan's Mansion.

530
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:53,800
(Yan's Mansion)
Come in. Come in. Come in.

531
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:55,400
Congratulations. Congratulations.

532
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:57,320
Lord Lin, come in.

533
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:59,120
You brought gifts. That's so nice of you.

534
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:01,480
Lord Zhang, come in. Come in.

535
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:03,080
Young Master Li, come in. Come in.

536
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:03,920
Come in.

537
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:07,280
-Congratulations.
-Congratulations.

538
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:08,760
-Thank you.
-Come in.

539
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:16,640
Congratulations on the birth of your child,
Great Spiritual Master Yan.

540
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:18,240
Come in. Come in.

541
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:19,480
Forgive us for our poor hospitality service.

542
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:20,440
-Come in.
-Here.

543
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:25,160
Congratulations, Great Spiritual Master Yan.

544
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:27,480
Go sit inside.

545
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:31,480
Senior Sister.

546
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:32,240
You are...

547
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:33,360
You are here too.

548
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:34,880
Zhao Ge.

549
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:36,640
You are Zhao Ge.

550
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:37,560
You are back to normal.

551
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:39,000
I...

552
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:43,600
The sisters of Celestial Palace,

553
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,600
our master and I are happy for you.

554
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:48,560
Zhao Ge,

555
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:49,920
did you come here alone?

556
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:51,400
I came with Wu.

557
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:53,440
She has got a stomachache.
She will be here soon.

558
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:55,000
Senior Sister,

559
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,240
let's see the child.

560
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:57,120
Come on.

561
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:00,280
So cute.

562
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:02,800
Come in. Come in.

563
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:03,800
Madam Ning, you are here.

564
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:04,800
Come in.

565
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:06,320
Come in.

566
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:10,640
I thought you had already
regained the energy to receive the guests

567
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:12,160
right after your delivery.

568
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:14,560
It turns out the concubine is doing your job.

569
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:15,040
You...

570
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:18,000
The legitimate wife hasn't said anything yet.

571
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:20,480
The concubine should stop messing around.

572
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:21,360
You...

573
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:23,400
People might think

574
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:24,920
she is the child's birth mother.

575
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:26,000
Master.

576
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:27,160
Stop it.

577
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:29,400
-Stay out of it.
-Look at the child.

578
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:32,720
By the way, have you seen Feng Wu?

579
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:33,640
No.

580
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:35,840
I owe this to Feng Wu.

581
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:36,440
If not for her,

582
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:37,880
I wouldn't have given birth to
this child successfully.

583
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,200
Yeah. What a lucky child!

584
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,120
The Fifth Young Lady of the Feng family

585
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:43,720
has overcome the challenges
at Peerless Tower.

586
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,520
She is an extraordinary woman indeed.

587
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,640
Even you, Goddess Zuo
of Celestial Palace,

588
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:49,160
commend Feng Wu.

589
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:50,640
I'm so happy for her.

590
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:53,200
Master,

591
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:55,120
the distinguished guest has arrived
and is waiting in the study.

592
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:56,440
The distinguished guest

593
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:58,680
wants to see you and Madam Yan.

594
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:01,160
Got it.

595
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:05,320
You should get going.

596
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:25,440
Hey.

597
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:27,000
What are you doing here?

598
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:29,560
What about you?

599
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:34,720
Many distinguished guests
are coming and going today.

600
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:35,960
I need you to guard this place

601
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:37,480
and stop unauthorized people

602
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:38,360
from entering this place.

603
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:39,240
Yes.

604
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:41,880
Since we have the same goal,

605
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:43,080
let's work together.

606
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:46,920
Today's number of guards
is much bigger than yesterday's.

607
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:48,640
It can be a problem.

608
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:51,520
Don't worry.

609
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:52,880
I came here

610
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:54,400
with a solution.

611
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:00,560
You have graced my humble house

612
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:02,960
with your presence, Your Highness Jun.

613
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:04,880
Great Spiritual Master Yan.

614
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:05,960
Madam Yan.

615
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:07,200
Long time no see.

616
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:08,520
Thank you

617
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:10,320
for helping us that day.

618
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:11,520
Yeah.

619
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,480
If you hadn't helped us,

620
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:16,710
we might have lost this child.

621
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:23,230
Your Highness Jun,

622
00:34:23,630 --> 00:34:24,880
what did you

623
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:26,480
come for today?

624
00:34:32,670 --> 00:34:34,630
There is a fire! Let's help put out the fire.

625
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:36,480
Put out the fire! Come on!

626
00:34:37,190 --> 00:34:37,710
Come on!

627
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:39,040
Hurry!

628
00:34:49,710 --> 00:34:51,400
How did Feng Wu
get up the nerve to criticize me?

629
00:34:51,670 --> 00:34:54,000
She went as far as to set a fire.

630
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:06,640
Colored Phoenix,

631
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:10,440
is this Water Sky Vase?

632
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:12,360
Yu Mingye must have

633
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:14,880
touched this vase.

634
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:16,320
So I sensed a faint trace

635
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:19,320
of the Star Shard essence in him.

636
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:21,320
But somehow,

637
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:24,720
I'm only sensing a faint trace
of the essence in this vase.

638
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:27,560
You were so fast.

639
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:31,360
I heard that a thief
has visited your mansion recently.

640
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:32,680
I think something strange is going on.

641
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:35,080
So I came to inquire about
the situation that day.

642
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:36,960
You think

643
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,960
there is a hidden truth?

644
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:40,160
Master.

645
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:44,720
Master, the yard was on fire.

646
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:45,680
But the fire has been extinguished.

647
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:47,320
Alright. That's fine.

648
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:49,120
Don't let it happen again. Go.

649
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:49,680
Yes.

650
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:53,360
What happened?

651
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,240
The weather has been dry lately.

652
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:56,760
The firewood in the yard

653
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,880
somehow caught on fire.

654
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:01,640
But it's okay.
The fire has been extinguished.

655
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:03,920
No.

656
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:10,640
-Young Master Feng.
-Where is His Highness Jun?

657
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:13,040
Young Master Feng,
His Highness Jun is not here.

658
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:14,720
He still hasn't come back.

659
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:15,680
Young Master Feng,

660
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,720
someone sent a letter here,

661
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:20,040
saying it was an urgent matter
of life and death.

662
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:21,680
The letter must be read by His Highness Jun.

663
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:24,080
But His Highness Jun hasn't come back yet.

664
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:25,400
It's okay. Give it to me.

665
00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:34,820
(Come to Shuixiang Street in the east of
the city if you want to save Young Lady Feng.)

666
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:38,200
She might lose her life?

667
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:40,320
Shuixiang Street.

668
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:48,880
Crap.

669
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:56,280
Your Highness Jun,

670
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:58,120
the Treasury Building is ahead of us.

671
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:02,920
Great.

672
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:04,120
We will get caught

673
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:05,440
for sure.

674
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:07,120
What should we do?

675
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:22,760
Nothing seems to be wrong.

676
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:40,440
Great Spiritual Master Yan,

677
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:43,080
is this Water Sky Vase

678
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:44,160
that almost got stolen yesterday?

679
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:45,880
It doesn't look authentic.

680
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:48,720
The real one must be stored elsewhere.

681
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:51,760
You have a keen eye.

682
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:52,760
Indeed,

683
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:54,680
this is not the real vase.

684
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:58,160
How did you know?

685
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:30,120
Odd.

686
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,120
How come I'm seeing
another vase in the secret chamber?

687
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:34,120
The real vase

688
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:35,960
must have unusual traits.

689
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:38,800
I'm sensing a trace

690
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:40,480
of the essence in this vase.

691
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:42,120
But the trace is faint.

692
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:44,240
I guess it must have been stored

693
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:46,480
with the real vase for a long time.

694
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:50,000
Water Sky Vase

695
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:51,880
is a masterpiece, after all.

696
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,520
It's also the treasure
that has been passed down in my family.

697
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,920
Of course I can't let it be found easily.

698
00:38:57,560 --> 00:39:00,240
The real vase has been stored
in the secret chamber.

699
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:05,560
Wait.

700
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:07,920
When was it touched?

701
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:21,920
Can it be...

702
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:25,520
Servants.

703
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:30,520
A thief has entered the Treasury Building.

704
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:32,440
I think the thief is trapped down there.

705
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:33,600
Go in there

706
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:35,600
and catch the thief.

707
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:36,400
Yes.

708
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:37,680
Hold on.

709
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:40,440
Great Spiritual Master Yan,

710
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:42,120
does the secret chamber

711
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:43,560
have any other exit?

712
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:45,040
There is an alternate passage

713
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:46,360
that leads to the garden.

714
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:48,720
But the switch

715
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:49,960
is well hidden.

716
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:52,440
It's under a purple vase.

717
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:55,040
The thief won't be able to find it.

718
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:59,200
We don't yet know

719
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:01,000
who the thief is

720
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:02,520
and the thief's goal.

721
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:05,080
It's not appropriate

722
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:05,960
to send so many people down there.

723
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:08,440
After all, the real
Water Sky Vase is in there.

724
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:09,320
Then

725
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:11,400
do you have any suggestions?

726
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:13,560
If you help me keep
Water Sky Vase,

727
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:15,440
you will have my gratitude.

728
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:18,200
You all should wait here.

729
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:19,760
I will go down there alone

730
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:21,680
to lower the thief's guard.
