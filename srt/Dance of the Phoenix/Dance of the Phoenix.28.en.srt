00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:40,420
(Episode 28)

3
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,360
I have been unable to come to the academy

4
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,760
to pay you a visit
in your dwelling all along.

5
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,040
I am finally here today.

6
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:32,760
I know you have nobody to look after you

7
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:35,760
and you handle
these medicinal herbs every day.

8
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,600
Don't tire your eyes.

9
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:40,920
Mom.

10
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,240
I am already a spiritual elder.

11
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:47,360
Right.

12
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,880
I forgot it.

13
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,320
You are no longer the girl
that you used to be

14
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,200
and don't need my protection any longer.

15
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:15,880
Mom.

16
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:17,920
No.

17
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:20,480
Madam.

18
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:22,840
I am sorry.

19
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,760
I don't know why

20
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:28,520
I look exactly like your daughter.

21
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:32,360
But I really can't indulge myself
in your motherly love

22
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,960
with this face resembling hers.

23
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,160
Also, I should return this Phoenix Sword

24
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:41,520
to your Feng family.

25
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,760
I have always known that

26
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,520
you are not my daughter Feng Wu.

27
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,880
After all, she has been
in my womb for ten months

28
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,600
and I have brought her up painstakingly.

29
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,560
How could I not see the difference

30
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:44,240
between you and Feng Wu?

31
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,120
But I lost my husband first.

32
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,480
Then I lost my daughter.

33
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:55,840
I have nobody to care about.

34
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:00,280
I still remember
when I saw you for the first time,

35
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:04,280
you were covered in blood

36
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,400
and looked exactly like my daughter.

37
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:11,960
How could I close the door on you?

38
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,640
As time passed,

39
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,480
I got used to having you around me.

40
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:22,480
I saw you as a gift from god.

41
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,080
Mom.

42
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:29,560
No.

43
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,120
Madam.

44
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,640
No matter what it is,

45
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,200
I know

46
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,800
you have been kind to me.

47
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,840
You have been treating me
as your biological daughter.

48
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:47,000
I cherish your love a lot.

49
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:50,040
However, from now on,

50
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,960
I will feel ashamed to continue...

51
00:05:58,920 --> 00:05:59,560
You need not,

52
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,120
kid.

53
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,160
I should thank you.

54
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,840
After Feng Wu's father passed away,

55
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:11,160
as she grew day by day,

56
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:14,320
it was harder and harder for her to smile.

57
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:19,560
She wanted to protect me from being bullied.

58
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:24,080
She wanted to shoulder the load
of the whole Feng family like her father.

59
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:26,920
When she felt hurt,

60
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:28,920
she put up with the pain.

61
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,680
When she felt aggrieved,

62
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:33,800
she endured in silence.

63
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,240
However, you are not like her.

64
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:41,440
You laugh and cry when you want to.

65
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,720
When I saw you,

66
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:47,400
I recalled what Feng Wu was like in the past.

67
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:01,040
My Feng Wu can't come back again.

68
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:05,640
But you are still here.

69
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,600
The Phoenix Sword belongs to you.

70
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,720
Jun Linyuan is yours, too.

71
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:15,080
You need not mind who you are.

72
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,560
You are who you are.

73
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,240
People stay with you

74
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,280
for who you are.

75
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,000
I gotta go now.

76
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,480
I have to return to our Feng family.

77
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,640
It is getting cold.

78
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,240
I made an article of thick clothing for you.

79
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:12,040
I will ask Qiu Ling to bring it
to you some other day.

80
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:26,520
Mom.

81
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,760
I dreamed of Feng Wu.

82
00:08:34,790 --> 00:08:36,280
She asked me to tell you

83
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:41,000
to eat more and cover yourself
with quilts while sleeping.

84
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,040
Mom.

85
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,480
No more words.

86
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,320
I got it.

87
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:50,480
You should also

88
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:53,200
eat more and cover yourself
with quilts while sleeping.

89
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,040
Are you still feeling sad
for your senior sister?

90
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,040
Yi.

91
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,360
I am fine.

92
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,880
Maybe this is

93
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:57,360
a kind of relief for my senior sister.

94
00:09:58,520 --> 00:09:59,680
What about the relationship
between you and Feng Wu?

95
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,160
Overnight,

96
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,480
my senior sister passed away

97
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:11,440
and my best friend
turned out to be another person.

98
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,880
My thoughts are in a mess now.

99
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,480
I don't know what to do.

100
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,360
People have to go through things

101
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:25,800
to grow up gradually.

102
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:28,280
Since you are concerned about her,

103
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,280
just go to see her.

104
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,200
It will be fine
if you two bare your soul to each other.

105
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:48,680
I know she had no choice.

106
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,480
But, every time I think of

107
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,800
getting close to her,

108
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:57,160
I feel I am betraying the real Wu.

109
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,800
Flowers remain the same every year.

110
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,640
But people come and go year after year.

111
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:17,920
Miss Zhao Ge,

112
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,040
since

113
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,760
the original Feng Wu has left,

114
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,360
which is cut and dried

115
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,800
and the present Feng Wu is your good friend,

116
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,080
which is also fact,

117
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:30,720
you need to face her,

118
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:31,880
accept her,

119
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,880
keep the former Feng Wu in your memory

120
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:37,480
and value the days
you spent with this Feng Wu.

121
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,000
I believe

122
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,240
she will definitely understand you.

123
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:42,680
What you said makes sense.

124
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,200
Nonetheless,

125
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:51,320
I shouldn't have said
that about Wu yesterday.

126
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,120
She treated me so nicely.

127
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,680
She also removed the poison from me.

128
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,320
and cooked delicious food for me.

129
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,480
What should I do?

130
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:05,360
Go apologize to her sincerely.

131
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,760
Since you are good friends,

132
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,840
she will certainly forgive you.

133
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:10,720
You are right.

134
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,760
If I cook some palatable food for Feng Wu,

135
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,240
she will forgive me for sure.

136
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:29,160
Xuan Yi. Xuan Yi.

137
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,920
It is surprising
that you can also console a girl.

138
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:33,960
If the other female disciples
of Junwu Academy

139
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:35,520
get to know this,

140
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,280
their hearts will be broken.

141
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:40,560
You are a young fellow
without a female partner,

142
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:42,720
so you don't understand.

143
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:44,480
How could you!

144
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:47,160
Xuan Yi!

145
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:10,680
Colored Phoenix.

146
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:11,720
Colored Phoenix.

147
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:14,800
Silly bird.

148
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,480
Why are you calling me silly bird again?

149
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,080
You are more and more impolite.

150
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:30,600
You finally showed yourself.

151
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,160
I want to ask you about something.

152
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,080
Since my master woke up,

153
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,360
there have always been people around him.

154
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:39,720
So I got no chance to ask him

155
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:42,240
where I come from and who I am.

156
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:44,000
Did he tell you about this?

157
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,360
No.

158
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,360
You must find a chance to ask him yourself.

159
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,240
You have waited for so long

160
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,680
and made so many efforts

161
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,920
only to make clear of these things.

162
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,360
Why don't you hurry to ask him?

163
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,000
Besides,

164
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,000
though my master came to himself,

165
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:07,960
be honest with me,

166
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:12,400
his spirit energy
has declined substantially, right?

167
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:14,400
How could that happen?

168
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:16,680
He is the great ruler of this continent,

169
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,400
and the founder of Junwu Academy.

170
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,280
Among all the cultivators
across Qianyuan Continent,

171
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,320
he is most likely to become an immortal.

172
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,240
Don't talk nonsense.

173
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:31,040
Why are you looking at me this way?

174
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,960
Are you doubting my words?

175
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:34,680
In terms of seniority,

176
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,400
I am a senior to you.

177
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,760
How can you doubt my words?

178
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:45,520
Master Mu!

179
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:46,720
Master Mu!

180
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,720
I will give you another chance.

181
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:50,640
If you don't tell me the truth,

182
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:52,080
I will cook you.

183
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:55,560
I will tell.

184
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:05,380
(Library Pavilion)

185
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,480
According to what you said,

186
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:11,760
back then, my master has

187
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:14,000
used half a drop of phoenix blood
to prolong my life.

188
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,560
Thus, he is in such conditions now.

189
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,880
If we compare spirit energy to

190
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:21,280
the blood running in Mu Jiuzhou's body,

191
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:24,440
the Phoenix Blood is like his heart.

192
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:26,920
No matter how much blood he has,

193
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,600
without a heart,

194
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:30,200
he will be a living dead.

195
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:31,640
To put it simply,

196
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:34,760
he is like a machine
losing the core component.

197
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,400
Com...component?

198
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:41,200
Master,

199
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:42,080
why are you up?

200
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,000
Hurry to go back to rest.

201
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:43,800
Don't worry.

202
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,800
Go have a walk with me.

203
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:58,680
Master,

204
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,200
you have sacrificed
such important stuff for me.

205
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,840
Why didn't you tell me?

206
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:09,000
You failed to keep the secret.

207
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:15,880
We are destined to cross paths.

208
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,320
Since I am your master,

209
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:20,240
I am obliged to do so.

210
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,440
A teacher for a day
is a father for a lifetime.

211
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:25,400
Don't you remember?

212
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,080
Yes, I do.

213
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,480
Now our Qianyuan Continent is in chaos.

214
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,240
Holy Queen Gao
takes the chance to stir up trouble.

215
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:34,800
I am useless.

216
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,920
Relying on my own strength,

217
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:39,400
I can't reverse the situation at all.

218
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,880
But you are different, Master.

219
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:44,280
If you still have your past spirit energy,

220
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:46,200
on your own,

221
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,320
you can turn the tide.

222
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:51,440
But I...

223
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:55,440
I am always thinking that it is a waste

224
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,160
for me to have the Phoenix Blood.

225
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:59,680
Do you still remember what I taught you?

226
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:02,080
Don't be arrogant and conceited.

227
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:05,880
Don't belittle yourself.

228
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:07,800
Master,

229
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:10,040
when did you teach me these?

230
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:11,830
You taught these

231
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,310
to another Feng Wu.

232
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:19,000
Anyway, am I right or not?

233
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:20,310
Yes, you are right.

234
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:22,350
But under the current circumstances,

235
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:23,830
what should we do?

236
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,440
All these arose out of me.

237
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:37,480
So I am meant to

238
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:41,080
bring it to an end.

239
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,520
Master,

240
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:45,480
what do you mean?

241
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,520
Don't be too worried.

242
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,440
When the proper time comes,

243
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,000
I will surely send you back

244
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,080
where you come from.

245
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:18,120
Are you sure
you can apologize by making this?

246
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:19,120
Of course.

247
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,880
Feng Wu once taught me to cook this.

248
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:21,720
It is

249
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,360
the Master Feng's instant noodles.

250
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,120
She said that when she was unhappy,

251
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:27,400
felt sad and depressed

252
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,080
and was up to her eyes in work,

253
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,560
a bowl of steaming instant noodles

254
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:32,080
would be the best thing

255
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,160
to cheer her up.

256
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,200
However, it requires a lot of work.

257
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,320
The noodles have to be fried.

258
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:43,920
Well,

259
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:46,120
let me help you.

260
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:47,840
Really?

261
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:49,760
Yi.

262
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,760
Didn't you say that even if we cultivators

263
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,080
weren't abstinent from food,

264
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,440
we couldn't indulge ourselves in eating?

265
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:56,360
It doesn't matter.

266
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:59,040
After eating so much of your food,
I should repay your kindness.

267
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:00,480
What should we do for the next?

268
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:01,840
Cut the noodles.

269
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:03,480
OK.

270
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:04,640
Look carefully.

271
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:55,640
Feng Wu.

272
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:57,080
We are very sorry.

273
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,360
We believed the rumors and misunderstood you.

274
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:00,520
Never mind.

275
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,320
I know that Feng Wu is magnanimous

276
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,040
and won't blame us for what we did.

277
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:05,120
Feng Wu.

278
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:06,720
Since you are the disciple of Master Mu,

279
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,160
you must have learned his real skills.

280
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:09,800
It is said that
he once became a Spirit Immortal

281
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,440
and was very close to immortal ascension.

282
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:12,240
Please tell us

283
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,320
how he taught you.

284
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:14,320
Please. Please.

285
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,480
If we can learn

286
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,040
one or two superior skills of him,

287
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:19,160
there will be hope for us
to become Great Spiritual Masters.

288
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:22,600
Zhao Ge.

289
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:25,600
What is that?

290
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:26,720
Did you prepare it for me?

291
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:31,800
It is the instant noodle.

292
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,040
The instant noodle?

293
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:34,920
What is that?

294
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:36,480
I never heard of that.

295
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,120
But how could Zhao Ge do this?

296
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,320
We are cultivators.

297
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,400
It is necessary for us
to fast for physical cultivation.

298
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:42,400
But she

299
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:43,520
just eats as she likes.

300
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,800
She also tries to drag others
into her indolence.

301
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:46,840
Zhao Ge and Feng Wu

302
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:48,160
are still young,

303
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:49,240
so I guess they just like trying new things.

304
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:49,960
I have

305
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:51,760
many immortal grass and spirit pills.

306
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:53,920
After taking them,
our cultivation will be improved.

307
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:55,080
Feng Wu,

308
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,920
would you like me to fetch some for you?

309
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:58,160
I have them, too.

310
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:59,000
Feng Wu.

311
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:00,040
Please give me a detailed account

312
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:01,400
about how Master Mu taught you

313
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:02,760
to enable you to progress so fast.

314
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:03,840
I will give my spirit pills to you.

315
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:04,960
Me too.

316
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,480
Feng Wu, please tell me, too.

317
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,160
I will give all my spirit pills to you.

318
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:11,120
Zhao Ge.

319
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:18,760
Wu.

320
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:20,200
I will leave you to your business.

321
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:21,760
I will be off.

322
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:23,400
Why need you leave?

323
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:25,880
All fellow cultivators,

324
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,000
I know that

325
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,680
you are all curious about
and admire Master Mu.

326
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,520
But even if you asked me,

327
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,680
I don't know what to say.

328
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:34,880
How about this?

329
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,440
I will go back to ask my master

330
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:39,000
whether he is willing
to give lectures in the academy.

331
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:40,280
Really?

332
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,320
Can we really attend Master Mu's lectures?

333
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,800
But you have to wait
till this crisis is over.

334
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,960
I guess my master won't refuse.

335
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:50,760
You'd better go back to make preparations.

336
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:52,760
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

337
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:08,920
Why are you standing there dumbly?

338
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:12,440
Come here quickly.

339
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:22,200
It is yummy.

340
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:24,960
Zhao Ge.

341
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,760
I decide to stop calling you
the incompetent chef.

342
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:38,680
Wu,

343
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:39,800
I am sorry.

344
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,720
I shouldn't have said that about you.

345
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:43,800
If you don't eat,

346
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:45,040
I will finish them all.

347
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:57,600
Hurry! Hurry!

348
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,120
Yi, I...

349
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:12,720
I...

350
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:16,160
I hope he didn't notice it.

351
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:18,480
Have you made up with Feng Wu?

352
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:22,960
Luckily, he didn't sense it.

353
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:24,360
Yes, I have.

354
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:27,080
The method you taught me helped a lot.

355
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:28,960
So I came to thank you.

356
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:33,000
You really came here only to thank me?

357
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:34,800
Of course.

358
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,440
I will be off if there is nothing else.

359
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:35,600
Eh.

360
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:38,960
It is really haw cake.

361
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:50,400
Miss Zhao Ge,

362
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,320
now the situation is getting
more and more complicated,

363
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:56,280
which is unexpected to all people.

364
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:05,880
But you need not worry.

365
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:09,120
No matter what happens,

366
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,760
I will stand by your side,

367
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:14,600
protect you

368
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:16,520
and be with you.

369
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:40,120
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!
Why are you allowing this to happen?

370
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:42,160
Junwu Clan and the Darknight Court

371
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,120
have been on opposing sides.

372
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:45,480
Your Majesty, you will put
the whole Qianyuan Continent

373
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:48,080
in jeopardy by doing this.

374
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:52,880
It is a fact that the Crown Prince
attempted to overthrow the Junwu Clan.

375
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:56,760
Is there anyone else who wants to defend him?

376
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:58,680
Come forward.

377
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,960
Nonsense!

378
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:15,040
You claimed His Highness
plotted against Junwu Clan.

379
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:17,240
What evidence do you have?

380
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
All courtiers.

381
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:24,520
Look!

382
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:26,960
Is the man sitting on the throne

383
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:29,080
still our Holy Sovereign?

384
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:33,560
He is obviously a puppet.

385
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:35,120
Spiritual Elder Fang,

386
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:37,480
please mind what you say.

387
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:40,200
You can vilify me,

388
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:43,200
but can't insult His Majesty.

389
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:48,800
You are not thinking that
by manipulating His Majesty,

390
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:51,120
you can bring everything
under control, are you?

391
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:55,360
All cultivators in the world have eyes to tell.

392
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:57,800
You talked so much nonsense.

393
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:11,160
Come on.

394
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:14,040
Kill me now.

395
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:16,600
If my death can

396
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:18,880
awaken all courtiers here.

397
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:22,400
I have nothing to fear.

398
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:23,080
Stop!

399
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:35,000
Spiritual Elder Fang
is the senior statesman of Junwu Clan

400
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:39,480
and has contributed a lot
to Qianyuan Continent over all these years.

401
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:41,800
At such a time,

402
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,600
you are still acting hypocritically

403
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:47,280
and shedding crocodile's tears.

404
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:49,360
Your life can be spared,

405
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:51,040
but you must be punished.

406
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:52,360
Attendants!

407
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:54,560
Take him away.

408
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:58,080
Have him remanded in custody and tried later.

409
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:01,600
Don't touch me.

410
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:38,720
Great Spiritual Master Yan,

411
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:43,360
why don't you say a word?

412
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:50,000
Do you have any unspeakable reason?

413
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:53,440
Your Majesty's doing is reasonable and fair.

414
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:55,720
I have no objection,

415
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,400
so I didn't say anything.

416
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:03,840
Very good!

417
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:20,760
All fellow spiritual masters,

418
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,760
allow me to say goodbye to you.

419
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:25,320
-Great Spiritual Master Yan, see you.
-See you.

420
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:34,120
Master.

421
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:35,880
Listen.

422
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,760
Now nobody is watching.

423
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:40,120
So, go hand over this letter
to Feng Wu herself.

424
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:40,800
Hurry up.

425
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:41,480
Yes, sir.

426
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:50,280
The Holy Queen Gao
is doing things so blatantly.

427
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:51,800
If this is the case,

428
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:53,960
we will imperil the lives
of all people of Junwu Academy

429
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:56,360
and implicate all of you

430
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:57,840
by staying here.

431
00:30:58,440 --> 00:30:59,480
Well, if we don't stay here.

432
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:00,440
where can we go?

433
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,440
The Holy Queen Gao
has taken control of the whole capital.

434
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:03,840
Even if we manage to escape by luck,

435
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:05,360
tens of thousands of minions
of the Darknight Court

436
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:06,680
will definitely hunt down us.

437
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:08,360
Penglai Pavilion can't rival them

438
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:10,400
and can't protect us.

439
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,160
In this world,

440
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:15,040
can't we find a shelter anywhere?

441
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:19,080
You are all students of Junwu Academy.

442
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:21,680
The academy is your shelter.

443
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:22,920
None of you needs to leave.

444
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:24,200
You just stay here.

445
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,840
If the Holy Queen Gao
has Junwu Academy stormed,

446
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:29,400
we will fight with all our might.

447
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:30,320
We mustn't allow this to happen.

448
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:31,720
We can't put so many students here in danger

449
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:34,000
for our own sake.

450
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:34,800
Moreover,

451
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:36,440
even if we mobilize the whole academy,

452
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:38,760
we can't defeat the Holy Queen Gao's forces.

453
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:40,080
Now we can only choose

454
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:42,120
to leave.

455
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:44,360
You are all my students

456
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:45,360
and the fellow cultivators

457
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:47,920
of hundreds of disciples of Junwu Academy.

458
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:49,160
As cultivators,

459
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:51,480
confronted with the current disaster,

460
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,480
if we don't uphold justice with our swords,

461
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:56,400
how can we live up
to the reputation of our academy?

462
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:03,680
Your Highness,

463
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:04,800
I am not so capable

464
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:06,320
and only good at teaching.

465
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:09,280
But if I can do my bit

466
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:10,240
for the peace of Qianyuan Continent,

467
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:12,240
I will charge at the head

468
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:14,960
even if I may be smashed into pieces.

469
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:25,880
Your Majesty,

470
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:27,520
Master Mu is still waiting outside.

471
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:29,120
Did he say anything?

472
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:05,000
He just waited for several hours

473
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:07,160
and presented an old item to you.

474
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:10,000
But you lost your composure and wavered.

475
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:16,670
Master Mu Jiuzhou
is really a resourceful man.

476
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:20,040
He achieved his goal easily
without resorting to force.

477
00:34:24,710 --> 00:34:25,920
It is a pity that

478
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:30,150
he didn't care about your feelings back then.

479
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:32,360
As a result, he broke your heart

480
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:34,560
and you tried to kill him

481
00:34:34,670 --> 00:34:36,230
while he was weak.

482
00:34:38,150 --> 00:34:39,600
If he gets to know that

483
00:34:39,670 --> 00:34:42,400
what caused his beloved woman
to die at that time,

484
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:43,360
do you think...

485
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:43,960
Enough!

486
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:45,880
Stop saying more.

487
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:50,120
Under the current circumstances,

488
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:52,670
nobody

489
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:56,520
can stop me from carrying out my plan.

490
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:01,280
Go give it back to him

491
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:02,520
and ask him to leave.

492
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:04,840
I won't see him.

493
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:41,320
Master Mu.

494
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:46,920
It has been a long time.

495
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:50,560
Your evil-foreboding air
hasn't weakened at all.

496
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:53,520
After so many years,

497
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:56,200
have you got rid of the doubts in your mind

498
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:58,560
and been aware of what you want exactly?

499
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:01,880
My aspirations have never changed.

500
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:04,880
You need not trouble yourself with this.

501
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:12,360
Ziyan said that

502
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:13,600
she would put the past behind her.

503
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:15,760
She won't see you again.

504
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:17,080
You can leave now.

505
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:26,120
With your current cultivation base,

506
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:27,880
you can't rival me.

507
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:30,040
You'd better find a place

508
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:32,400
to enjoy some more happy days.

509
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:37,280
It won't be long before

510
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:40,760
I send you to the other world.

511
00:36:56,160 --> 00:37:00,400
All disciples of Junwu Academy,
emergency muster!

512
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:07,480
All disciples,

513
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:10,320
I guess you all heard about

514
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,960
what is going on at present.

515
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:15,000
Now the wicked queen is in power

516
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:16,720
and she is manipulating His Majesty.

517
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:19,760
Many years ago,
Master Mu founded Junwu Academy

518
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:23,120
to eradicate the evil and defend the right.

519
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:26,160
As a member of Junwu Academy,

520
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:28,520
how can you shrink back and do nothing?

521
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:29,880
But, in the present situation,

522
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:31,600
it is undoubtedly a hopeless battle

523
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:33,160
if we fight against
the Darknight Court and Holy Queen Gao.

524
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:33,920
Master Zhao.

525
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:35,480
Do we really have a good chance of winning?

526
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:37,200
Yes, do we?

527
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:38,800
Don't talk about eradicating the evil
and defending the right.

528
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:40,040
To be honest,

529
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:41,440
we came here for cultivation back then

530
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:43,880
only for the centennial reputation
of the academy.

531
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:45,000
Is it really necessary for us

532
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,920
to die for

533
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:48,320
the intangible lofty ideals?

534
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:51,320
How come Junwu Academy

535
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:52,720
have students like you?

536
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:06,000
If Qianyuan Continent falls into disorder,
what will you do?

537
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:09,400
Staying aloof from trouble
can only keep you safe temporarily.

538
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,080
Have you conducted cultivation

539
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,760
only to satisfy your personal desires?

540
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:25,480
Master Mu.

541
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:30,720
Forget it.

542
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:36,560
If some disciples don't want to stay,

543
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,600
they can leave now.

544
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:12,120
Feng Wu.

545
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:15,320
Don't worry too much about me.

546
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:18,040
My spiritual cognition has been damaged.

547
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:20,040
It is natural for me to be unable
to do things as I wish.

548
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:24,640
I have lived for so many years.

549
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:26,560
It is a great blessing.

550
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:28,440
Master.

551
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:30,080
I am worthless.

552
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:32,560
I can't share your burden.

553
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:35,800
I can't help Jun Linyuan out, either.

554
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
I didn't expect

555
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:44,200
the present Junwu Academy

556
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:47,360
is like a heap of loose sand.

557
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:50,680
I guess all sects

558
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:52,800
also only try to secure their own safety.

559
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:54,600
Such being the case,

560
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:58,120
we won't be able to fight against

561
00:39:58,120 --> 00:40:00,920
the Darknight Lord Demon and the Holy Queen.

562
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:02,840
Master,

563
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:04,600
what should we do, then?

564
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:06,640
The only way out for us now

565
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:12,960
is to fight a decisive battle
relying on your power.

566
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:15,320
My power?

567
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:17,200
Yes.

568
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:21,760
I need you to return to where you come from

569
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,120
to find the power

570
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:25,080
and to do it all over again.

571
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:26,640
In this way,

572
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:28,880
we can go back in time

573
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:31,480
and stop all this

574
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:33,000
before it happens.

575
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:36,840
Master.

576
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:39,120
Is this the only way?

577
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:42,040
If changes occur after I go back,

578
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:44,000
what should I do?

579
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,560
Everything is predestined.

580
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:51,040
You only need to let nature take its course.

581
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:57,560
OK.

582
00:40:58,120 --> 00:40:59,360
Now go prepare for it.

583
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:01,800
I will have a rest for a while.

584
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:03,560
When the day after tomorrow comes,

585
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:05,920
I will see you off.

586
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:11,280
Jun Linyuan,

587
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:13,400
I promise I will come back

588
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:15,240
to face all this with you.

589
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:17,440
You must wait for me.

590
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:21,280
Come out.

591
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:52,040
Master Mu.

592
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,840
What power do you want
Feng Wu to find exactly

593
00:41:57,720 --> 00:41:58,840
after she returns to where she comes from?
