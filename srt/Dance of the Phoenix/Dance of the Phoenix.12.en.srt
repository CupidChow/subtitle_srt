2
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:40,580
(Episode 12)

3
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,440
Your Majesty, you're always kind-hearted.

4
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,160
Could you help me find
a detoxification elixir

5
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,000
in Junwu Divine Hall?

6
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:52,800
I will do my best

7
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,280
to repay your great kindness.

8
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,720
It seems that

9
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,800
you attach great importance
to your Junior Sister.

10
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:01,200
You misunderstood.

11
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:03,400
I'm Senior Sister of Celestial Palace.

12
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:06,360
It is my duty to look after other sisters.

13
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,160
After she went to the capital,

14
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,600
we have less contact.

15
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:14,120
I'm also interested in this poison,

16
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,800
so...

17
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,190
It's a pity

18
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,640
that there are indeed
a lot of treasured elixirs

19
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:21,080
in Junwu Divine Hall.

20
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:23,840
But this poison is really rare

21
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,120
and there is no cure for it.

22
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,480
I'm sorry for disturbing you

23
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,600
in this case.

24
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,920
Why don't you go to Peerless Tower to ask?

25
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:40,760
They are rumored to have a treasure.

26
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:41,800
I knew.

27
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,720
I have considered before.

28
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,680
But it is rumored that those
who fail to break through Peerless Tower

29
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,440
will lose their entire cultivation base.

30
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,720
So I dare not go rashly.

31
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,000
This is true.

32
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,000
But there is nothing in this world

33
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:01,200
that can be easily obtained

34
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:03,840
without paying any price.

35
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,680
How to choose

36
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:08,920
depends on your own choice.

37
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:21,500
(Peerless Tower)

38
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:30,660
(Peerless Tower)

39
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:36,760
Why are you here?

40
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:37,880
I have been with you for a long time.

41
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:39,000
Didn't you find out?

42
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,800
With your acumen,

43
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,960
you are really unqualified
for a medium-rank spiritual practitioner.

44
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:44,640
It's none of your business.

45
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:46,920
Follow me.

46
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,760
Why? Where are you going?

47
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,880
Why did you bring me here?

48
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,920
Don't you live in the
Feng family uncomfortably?

49
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,920
I want to build a house for you here.

50
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,240
No, thanks. This is so troublesome.

51
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,760
Not at all. Just right here.

52
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,680
I have chosen.

53
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,000
I will prepare some necessary items

54
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:10,680
and clothing for you.

55
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,160
You can live here anytime.

56
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,320
You can tell me whatever you want.

57
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,800
I will have someone bought it for you.

58
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:18,760
Madam and Qiu Ling can also come with you.

59
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:21,280
No need.

60
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:22,560
I...

61
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:26,000
Why do you give me a house

62
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,270
without a reason?

63
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,040
Besides,

64
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,880
did I say that I wanted to live
in the capital for a long time?

65
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,720
I wouldn't be here

66
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,040
if you hadn't

67
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,360
tricked my mom over.

68
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:35,520
I did these

69
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,040
because you live uncomfortably
in the Feng family.

70
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,040
You are sometimes friendly to me

71
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:43,240
and sometimes indifferent to me.

72
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,280
What on earth do you want?

73
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:46,320
I,

74
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:49,040
I just think

75
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:51,680
it is a bit too fast between us.

76
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:52,880
Why?

77
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:55,040
You are my Spiritual Princess.

78
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:57,280
You should stay with me more.

79
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,600
What are you talking about?

80
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,040
When did I promise you?

81
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:03,800
You regret it.

82
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,720
Not really.

83
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,600
I really like you,

84
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,080
but I didn't mean to be

85
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,440
your wife right now.

86
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,360
You didn't ask me

87
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,800
and made a decision without authorization.

88
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:19,160
I understand that

89
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,280
Spiritual Princess is just
a virtual title for you.

90
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:23,960
You are so eclectic.

91
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,600
You don't care at all, right?

92
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,320
I didn't mean that.

93
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:28,240
You...

94
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,560
Didn't you mean that?

95
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:30,440
I...

96
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,360
Anyway, I just don't want it.

97
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,960
Don't you understand my mind?

98
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,440
Yes, I do.

99
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,440
But how can I

100
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,400
make you understand my mind?

101
00:05:57,740 --> 00:05:58,860
(Peerless Tower)

102
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:27,560
It is rumored that the famous
Peerless Tower in the capital

103
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:31,320
was built by miraculous persons

104
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,000
from outside Qianyuan Continent.

105
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,600
(Peerless Tower)
There are four barriers,

106
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:38,440
and each barrier is guarded
by a different gatekeeper.

107
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:39,920
Although Quatrain,

108
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,360
the gatekeeper of the first barrier,

109
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,800
is a cultivator,

110
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,720
he is more like a poet.

111
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:16,040
Small. Small. Big. Big.

112
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,240
Stop. Open.

113
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,240
Greediness,

114
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,880
the gatekeeper of the second barrier,

115
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,400
is best at insight into people's mind.

116
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:28,680
Today I will take out my money.

117
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,080
You can win my money

118
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,760
with your skill.

119
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:34,000
Come on. Bet.

120
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,000
Bet. Bet.

121
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,840
Come on. Bet. All-in.

122
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:42,600
Big. Big.

123
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:46,040
However, his hearing is even better.

124
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:51,360
Big. Big. Open. Open.

125
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:51,960
Open.

126
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,360
The gatekeeper of the third barrier

127
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:16,960
is Shadow Swordsman.

128
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:20,920
The One-strike Drawing Chop is his stunt.

129
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,360
He looks like a ruthless character.

130
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,560
As for the last barrier of Peerless Tower,

131
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:34,680
it is said that

132
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,080
no one knows

133
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,520
what the challenge is.

134
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,550
Why is there no information

135
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:52,680
on the last barrier of Peerless Tower?

136
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,680
I like you so much,

137
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,560
stewed pork with brown sauce cooked by Wu.

138
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:20,320
The information on
the last barrier is missing.

139
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,920
If I'm rushing in,

140
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,040
I'm afraid the winning rate is lower.

141
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,600
Moreover, the book says that

142
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:29,360
breaking through Peerless Tower is
a matter of life and death.

143
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,120
If I succeed,

144
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:33,080
my spirit energy may be up to the next rank.

145
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:34,800
If I fail,

146
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:37,240
it will be a waste of cultivation base.

147
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:51,640
That poker face is
Crown Prince of the capital.

148
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,400
What would he say

149
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:56,840
if I ask him?

150
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,960
What are you going to do in Peerless Tower?

151
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:06,640
That kind of place

152
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,920
is not something

153
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,160
a spiritual practitioner
like you can get through.

154
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,360
It's too hard.

155
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:28,440
You're here.

156
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,480
I have something to tell you.

157
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,000
Did you ask me out today

158
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:47,680
because you changed your mind?

159
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,360
I...

160
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,280
I hope you can go to Junwu Academy.

161
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:55,760
Junwu Academy?

162
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,080
There are rules in Junwu Clan.

163
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,800
All women who have not reached
the senior-rank spiritual practitioner or above

164
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,680
are not eligible to participate
in the selection of Spiritual Princess.

165
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,240
I know you lost all
your spirit energy before.

166
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:06,360
Now you have finally reached the medium rank.

167
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:07,240
But...

168
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:08,760
I also know that

169
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:09,720
it is not easy for you

170
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,640
to reach a high rank in such a short time.

171
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:12,960
After all,

172
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,640
you still think I'm not worthy of you.

173
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:15,960
I definitely don't mean that.

174
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,640
Her Majesty

175
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,600
has put my marriage on the agenda
in front of His Majesty.

176
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:23,560
I hope I can restore your reputation quickly.

177
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,880
Her Majesty thinks I am not worthy of you.

178
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,960
Who did she propose?

179
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:29,520
Zuo Qingluan?

180
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,240
What she thinks doesn't matter.

181
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,960
What matters is who I want.

182
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,240
I really don't understand

183
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,520
your thoughts.

184
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:38,880
Why do you

185
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,160
want to be with me?

186
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,600
I'm too stupid.

187
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,680
Why should I ask you to come here?

188
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:50,160
Don't you have something to tell me?

189
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,240
I want to say that

190
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:58,160
I also want to quickly
improve my spirit energy

191
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:59,480
and become a senior-rank
spiritual practitioner,

192
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,200
but I have my own plans

193
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,000
and don't need you to tell me how to do it.

194
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:05,840
I will decide my own life

195
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,160
by myself.

196
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:20,520
I was really out of mind

197
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:21,800
and actually wanted to ask him for help.

198
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,400
He said he liked me?

199
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:26,320
It is just sweet words.

200
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:32,600
You...

201
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,240
What's wrong, Little Fairy?

202
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:37,360
Who bullied you?

203
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,440
Today I am not in a good mood.

204
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,640
Don't follow me.

205
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:44,040
You lied to and tricked me boldly

206
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:45,160
before.

207
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,520
Aren't you ashamed?

208
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:50,440
Fine.

209
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:52,320
I have offended Darknight Court

210
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,080
and acted recklessly.

211
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,320
Anyway, I might lose all
my spirit energy tomorrow.

212
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,000
You might as well kill me now

213
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,480
and sacrifice me to your lord.

214
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:09,960
Are you interested in Peerless Tower?

215
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:12,640
You know again?

216
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:16,120
Actually, I'm a mind reader.

217
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:21,320
I have actually researched Peerless Tower.

218
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:23,400
As the young master of Darknight Court,

219
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:24,760
there's really no need to challenge them

220
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:26,280
and let them get related to my fame,

221
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:27,960
otherwise I would also have a try.

222
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:29,520
Then guess

223
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,920
what I want to eat tonight.

224
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:35,320
Forget about it. Leave me alone.

225
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:36,880
I can really help you.

226
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:47,860
(Three Days Later)

227
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:55,060
(Peerless Tower)

228
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,360
My Lady,

229
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,360
it's dangerous inside.

230
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,640
Are you really going to take such a big risk?

231
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,240
Whether I remember it or not,

232
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,640
she is my good friend.

233
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:09,720
What's more,

234
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,800
Zhao Ge was poisoned because of me.

235
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:13,560
I see.

236
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:17,520
Feng Wu,

237
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,600
be careful not to get hurt.

238
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:24,680
Wu,

239
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:27,000
you really don't have to do it for me.

240
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:29,200
I will come out safely with it.

241
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,200
Rest assured.

242
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:37,520
Hit the stone drum first
before you can enter.

243
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,600
How can I hit the stone drum?

244
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,200
Where is the drumstick?

245
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,640
Wu, use your spirit energy.

246
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,640
I didn't get it sounded in the past,

247
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:55,720
so I didn't even get the qualification.

248
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,560
The 1037th challenger

249
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:20,680
comes to challenge.

250
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,240
What sound?

251
00:17:28,350 --> 00:17:29,800
Feng Wu, concentrate.

252
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:45,760
Either fight

253
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,480
or let me go.

254
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:48,720
Don't be wordy.

255
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:51,240
Your temper

256
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:53,080
is unique

257
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,120
even in the capital.

258
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,360
How can you let me pass?

259
00:17:58,560 --> 00:17:59,400
Take it easy.

260
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:00,600
Take it easy.

261
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:04,520
Since I am known as Quatrain,

262
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:07,520
I'm naturally best at couplets.

263
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:10,960
Since you came to Peerless Tower today,

264
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:14,320
I just want to consult you about it.

265
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:16,000
You're giving me a hard time.

266
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:19,880
Feng Wu

267
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,040
doesn't look very smart.

268
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,400
Isn't this making things difficult?

269
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:24,040
Shut up.

270
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,640
I mean

271
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,280
you are deliberately making
things difficult for me.

272
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:34,280
If you must pay attention to level
and oblique tones and rhymes,

273
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:35,800
it is really difficult.

274
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:39,480
You only need to be correct
in the number of words

275
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:40,760
and the meaning is novel

276
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:42,160
before you pass.

277
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:54,240
Yi River, Luo River and Qingshui River
all run to the sea.

278
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:58,560
Miss, please give me your answer.

279
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:38,360
Addition, subtraction, multiplication
and division decide the universe.

280
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,800
You really have a strange idea.

281
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,160
But I don't understand

282
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:52,480
what addition is,

283
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:53,920
what subtraction is,

284
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,760
and what multiplication and division are.

285
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,320
You won't understand even if I tell you.

286
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,240
Anyway, I follow the rules.

287
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,200
Isn't that enough?

288
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:01,840
Let me go on.

289
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:05,000
Black is impermanent
and white is impermanent.

290
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:08,160
Between black and white, white speaks
of Yin and Yang and reincarnation.

291
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:21,320
The proposition is false
and the proposition is true.

292
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:24,840
Amid the false and the true,
the true shows the geometry of life.

293
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,120
What does it mean?

294
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:31,600
Master, let me pass.

295
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:32,560
Take it easy.

296
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,360
Let me give you some advice.

297
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:38,960
The road ahead is dangerous.

298
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,400
Please don't go up anymore.

299
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:42,720
Thanks for reminding.

300
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,760
But I still have to go.

301
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,120
Is the treasure in the world

302
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:47,760
really more important than life?

303
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:49,720
The treasure is not important.

304
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:51,320
Since I've promised my friend,

305
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,760
I will do it naturally.

306
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:56,080
In that case,

307
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,360
please raise a question.

308
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:05,480
The law of sines and the law of cosines

309
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:08,560
set your mind and tell you the truth.

310
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:18,760
Congratulations!

311
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:20,120
You pass.

312
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,960
This place is spooky.

313
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:30,920
Be careful.

314
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:31,640
I see.

315
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,320
Can't you see me?

316
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,320
But I can see you.

317
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:51,200
Little girl,

318
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:54,400
can't you use your spirit energy?

319
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:57,680
Guess

320
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:58,960
where I am

321
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:00,800
in darkness.

322
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,040
Shut up.

323
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:09,520
I can see your every move clearly.

324
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,120
How is it?

325
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:13,160
Do you dare to challenge?

326
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:14,160
Greediness,

327
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,000
it is said that your hearing is several times
better than that of ordinary people.

328
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:20,040
Not bad, little girl.

329
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:22,960
You know how strong I am.
How dare you come and challenge?

330
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:24,560
I am not only brave.

331
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:27,560
I will let you know my skills.

332
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,680
Don't talk big.

333
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:37,280
Boss Jun,

334
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:38,840
you seem to be very ruthless today.

335
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,000
You're usually lazy.

336
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,600
What if you are facing a powerful enemy?

337
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:49,720
Bad news. Bad news. Feng Wu is in danger.

338
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:59,240
You take advantage of my distraction.

339
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:01,640
Don't fight. Don't fight.

340
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,240
You two, stop.

341
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:06,440
I went to Feng's Mansion this morning

342
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:07,520
and they said Feng Wu was not there.

343
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:08,640
After inquiring,

344
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:10,320
I knew she had gone to Peerless Tower.

345
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:11,440
Peerless Tower?

346
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:13,280
Isn't that a place
where no one can get through?

347
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:14,080
Indeed.

348
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:15,480
Why did she have to

349
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:17,320
go to that place to suffer?

350
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:20,160
Leave her alone.

351
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:22,640
If I act rashly,

352
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,360
I will only annoy her.

353
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:28,440
What's that harsh sound?

354
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:36,900
(Peerless Tower)

355
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:47,640
Senior Sister.

356
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:49,200
I'm passing by.

357
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:51,720
I just come and see the situation.

358
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:19,880
Your craft is not good either.

359
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:22,200
Is this useful?

360
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:23,840
Of course.

361
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:25,840
You should make use of

362
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:27,200
his good hearing

363
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,560
to cause him the greatest damage.

364
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:35,240
The Ear-piercing Bird is quite powerful.

365
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:37,280
It seems

366
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:38,720
she has passed the first challenge.

367
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:46,560
Pass.

368
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:48,040
Stop it.

369
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,520
You've passed.

370
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:53,400
Thanks.

371
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:05,360
Madam,

372
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:06,440
how about having a rest

373
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:08,400
in the tea house nearby with Qiu Ling?

374
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:09,400
I'll be waiting here.

375
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:10,440
Or you will be exhausted

376
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:11,640
when Feng Wu comes out later.

377
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:25,480
Madam,

378
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,120
my master let me send you this.

379
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:28,520
Please sit down.

380
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:32,560
It's her again.

381
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:35,560
Who is your master?

382
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,800
My master is Young Lady Feng Wu's husband.

383
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:40,640
I made a mistake.

384
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:41,960
My master means

385
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:44,240
he will be Young Lady Feng Wu's
husband sooner or later.

386
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:48,840
Madam, please excuse our leaving.

387
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:56,600
Madam, let me help you sit down.

388
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:06,440
Senior Sister, come over to sit down.

389
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:07,320
You take the seat.

390
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:15,400
Do you know when

391
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:17,000
you should coax

392
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:18,640
or stay away from a girl?

393
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:20,960
Cultivators who have gone
through Peerless Tower

394
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:22,240
are badly injured or dead.

395
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:24,960
Feng Wu is a medium-rank
spiritual practitioner.

396
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:26,480
What if she's bullied?

397
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:28,560
And,

398
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:31,520
I saw Yu Mingye

399
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:33,000
was with Feng Wu yesterday.

400
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:36,000
Someone may regret later.

401
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:39,200
Taking challenges in Peerless Tower
is not a small matter.

402
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:40,040
Boss Jun,

403
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,520
are you really going to leave her alone?

404
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:44,360
What did you say to her?

405
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:46,360
It's known to all that

406
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:47,560
people who take challenges in Peerless Tower

407
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:49,840
will greatly improve their spirit energy
or lose their cultivation base.

408
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:51,800
Why does Feng Wu take such a big risk?

409
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:53,400
Does it have anything to do with you?

410
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:34,680
What's this?

411
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,920
It's secret weapon of Darknight Court,

412
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,040
Black Jade Sleeve Arrow.

413
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:40,800
Why do you give me this?

414
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:41,800
It won't be difficult for you

415
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:43,120
to pass the first two challenges

416
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:44,680
with my tips.

417
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:47,480
But in the third challenge,

418
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:51,120
Shadow Swordsman is enigmatic.

419
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:54,240
No one has ever seen him
pull out all the stops.

420
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,280
If you really can't defeat him,

421
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:57,760
you may use Black Jade Sleeve Arrow.

422
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:58,960
It can help you win.

423
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:05,440
If you hesitate a little bit,

424
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:07,560
you will definitely lose.

425
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:25,880
It seems you haven't known

426
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:27,920
what you want yet.

427
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:30,920
You knew I'd deal with you by arrow.

428
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:33,840
I'm very interested in you.

429
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,200
Don't let me down.

430
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:37,160
There's no rule in this challenge.

431
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:39,120
Just do your best.

432
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:41,120
I will.

433
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:01,840
Drawing Chop.

434
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:03,520
Feng Wu,

435
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:05,240
this man is different from previous ones.

436
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:06,640
He's at a much higher level.

437
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:11,420
(Peerless Tower)

438
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:24,880
Young Master, Lord Demon wants to meet you.

439
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:30,200
Okay.

440
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:31,520
I know.

441
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:51,120
It's said that Peerless Tower

442
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:53,040
was built by an extremely wealthy merchant.

443
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:55,080
At the top of the tower,
there are two precious treasures.

444
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:57,880
One is Heavenly Heart Pistil
which can antidote all poisons in the world.

445
00:31:58,040 --> 00:31:58,720
The other is

446
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,720
Qinglingsan Score

447
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:01,960
pursued by refined scholars.

448
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:03,400
But it's strange that

449
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:04,440
no one has finished

450
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,320
all the challenges in the tower
in nearly 30 years.

451
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:09,160
Doesn't anyone know

452
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:10,840
the last challenge of Peerless Tower?

453
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:12,360
I know.

454
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:13,920
Someone

455
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:15,760
may know.

456
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:16,960
Who?

457
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:19,480
Min Zhongqing,
the fourth son of the Min family.

458
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:21,680
Min Zhongqing?

459
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:23,200
Do you know him?

460
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:25,120
I met him once years ago.

461
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:27,960
The Min family is not
a big clan in the capital.

462
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,920
But Min Zhongqing is a man of integrity

463
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:31,040
who works hard.

464
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:33,440
He has become a high-rank
spiritual practitioner at 20.

465
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:35,480
That's not what I've heard.

466
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:39,240
After he got out of Peerless Tower,

467
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:40,640
he was like a different person.

468
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,800
He was dissipated,

469
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:45,080
which delayed his cultivation.

470
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:46,320
He was slow in action

471
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:48,080
and too weak to practice.

472
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:50,360
Besides, he couldn't gather his spirit energy.

473
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:53,400
He's a wreck now.

474
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:56,440
What a pity.

475
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:57,440
But it's said that

476
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:59,000
he passed the third challenge

477
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:01,040
in Peerless Tower.

478
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:03,360
You two wait outside Peerless Tower.

479
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,560
Act flexibly when something happens.

480
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:06,600
What about you?

481
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:08,840
I'm going to meet Min Zhongqing.

482
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:49,340
(Peerless Tower)

483
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,320
Why hasn't Wu come out yet?

484
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:54,600
Did she

485
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,640
meet with any danger?

486
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:00,720
Only challenger is allowed.

487
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:02,520
Just let me go in.

488
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:04,160
Feng Wu has been inside for long.

489
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:05,240
I need to go to have a look.

490
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:06,160
Junior Sister,

491
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:08,120
Peerless Tower has its own rule.

492
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:09,120
Don't break it.

493
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:12,080
Feng Wu took the risk for me.

494
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:13,920
I can't let her face dangers alone.

495
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:14,680
No.

496
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:17,230
If something bad happens to you,

497
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:18,520
Master will be worried.

498
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:19,520
Senior Sister,

499
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:21,080
just leave me alone.

500
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:23,710
No one in Celestial Palace
cares about me anyway.

501
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:25,630
It was hard for me to reconnect with Wu.

502
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:27,080
I can't put her in danger.

503
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:28,360
-Stop!
-Zhao Ge.

504
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:29,800
Or I'll be rude to you!

505
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:30,360
You...

506
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:31,040
Stop.

507
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:37,800
Mr. Xuan Yi, Young Master Feng.

508
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:41,280
Don't act rashly.

509
00:34:41,670 --> 00:34:43,840
There's no big noise in the tower now.

510
00:34:44,150 --> 00:34:45,080
And Feng Wu hasn't come out.

511
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:46,670
It means that she's safe now.

512
00:34:47,150 --> 00:34:48,360
If you break in rashly,

513
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:49,560
it may cause big trouble.

514
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:51,320
It's you.

515
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:53,080
Don't worry.

516
00:34:53,190 --> 00:34:54,230
She will be fine.

517
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:55,670
After all,

518
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:57,800
he will not watch her being in danger.

519
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:00,880
Do you mean His Highness Jun?

520
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:02,230
Of course.

521
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:21,480
By your skills,

522
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:23,600
you can save many people

523
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:25,360
if you fight with demonic beast.

524
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:28,560
I couldn't even save my beloved.

525
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:30,920
Don't talk about great love with me.

526
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:33,760
Why did you cultivate yourself?

527
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:35,920
Who are wielding your sword for?

528
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:42,680
The world is big.

529
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:44,920
Why do you want to spend a lifetime

530
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:45,960
in this narrow Peerless Tower?

531
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:53,080
Feng Wu, do it now.

532
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,080
You said you'd lose once you hesitate.

533
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:38,480
No matter what you stay here for,

534
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,280
I have my own reason

535
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:41,960
for passing through here.

536
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:44,680
Why didn't you kill me just now?

537
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:46,360
I'm here to take challenges.

538
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:47,880
I have no grudge against you.

539
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:49,520
Why should I kill you?

540
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:02,600
Good.

541
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:04,000
Good.

542
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:07,960
It's been a long time
since I saw such a good fight.

543
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:10,560
Who are you?

544
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:13,160
I'm the owner of Peerless Tower,

545
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:16,280
as well as the last gatekeeper.

546
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,040
Come on. Catch me.

547
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:19,280
Stop running.

548
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:25,360
I will punish you when I catch you.

549
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:28,000
Mr. Min.

550
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:29,640
Come on.

551
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:33,360
Come on. Catch me.

552
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:34,440
Go on.

553
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:40,000
Where are you?

554
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:45,400
Where are you?

555
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:49,240
I've caught you!

556
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:54,000
Who are you?

557
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:55,080
How did you get in?

558
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:56,400
I want to talk to you.

559
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:58,240
I don't want to talk.

560
00:37:58,720 --> 00:37:59,760
You sneaked in

561
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:01,080
and ruined my mood.

562
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:03,280
You're provoking the wrong person.

563
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:09,680
Do you know who I am?

564
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:12,480
I'm the fourth son of the Min family,

565
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:14,680
who retreated intact from Peerless Tower.

566
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:22,120
Tell me.

567
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,000
What's the secret of

568
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:25,920
the fourth challenge in Peerless Tower?

569
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:28,000
So,

570
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:29,120
as long as I defeat you,

571
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:30,600
I will succeed.

572
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:32,040
Yes,

573
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:34,760
but I don't think it's necessary.

574
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:48,640
What do you mean?

575
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:50,280
You're awesome enough

576
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:51,640
to reach here.

577
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:53,880
Take all these and go down the tower.

578
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,040
I don't want these things.

579
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:57,960
I want Heavenly Heart Pistil,

580
00:38:58,080 --> 00:38:59,480
one of the precious treasures in the tower.

581
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:02,240
Miss,

582
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:05,000
take these things and leave.

583
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:06,560
The man in front of you

584
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:08,120
is hard to deal with.

585
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:12,120
Shadow Swordsman is smart.

586
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:13,600
He's right.

587
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,360
Stop while you're at it.

588
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:18,280
The reputation of Peerless Tower in decades

589
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:20,480
can't be lost.

590
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:24,920
What on earth do you mean?

591
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:30,560
Don't kill me. Don't...

592
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:31,360
I'll tell you.

593
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:32,680
Please spare me.

594
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:34,040
The challenges in Peerless Tower

595
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:35,600
are just bluffs.

596
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:38,000
They don't intend to let anyone make it.

597
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:40,680
The fourth challenge

598
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:43,160
is about human nature.

599
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:45,200
You gave up in the fourth challenge

600
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:47,440
in exchange for

601
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:48,960
the things

602
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:50,560
you are splurging now.

603
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:06,640
As a cultivator, you actually did such things.

604
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:08,760
As a member of Junwu Clan,

605
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:10,560
I feel ashamed of you.

606
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:16,160
Put it simply,

607
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:17,040
if no one succeeds in

608
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:19,560
finishing all challenges in Peerless Tower,

609
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:21,120
it can keep its popularity,

610
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:23,040
so I can earn more money.

611
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:26,840
Peerless Tower is actually
such a hypocritical place.

612
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:29,760
Little girl, just stop here.

613
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,480
Take the gold and silver
and keep your mouth shut.

614
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:34,760
You will be wealthy.

615
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:36,200
Or...

616
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:37,560
Or what?

617
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:42,160
Or you won't be able to leave.

618
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:52,280
This is Heart-eroding Maze aimed at you.

619
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:53,200
Lower your head.

620
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:00,480
You should give up now.

621
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:02,600
I only want Heavenly Heart Pistil.

622
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:04,360
I'll leave as long as

623
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:05,640
I get it.
