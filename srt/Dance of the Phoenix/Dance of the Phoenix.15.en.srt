2
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:40,660
(Episode15)

3
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,920
Our Young Lady said no to Phoenix Tea.

4
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:51,920
She must be really upset.

5
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,680
Feng Wu had prepared breakfast,

6
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,960
a massage and a small gift,

7
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,600
and yet nothing happened.

8
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:01,440
His Highness is indeed no ordinary man.

9
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,400
Hateful man.

10
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:07,200
How dare he toy with Wu's feelings?

11
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:09,560
Qiu Ling, go tell Feng Wu

12
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:11,760
that Jun Linyuan will need my permission

13
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,280
if he wants to see her again.

14
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:17,910
But our Young Lady is so stubborn.

15
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Do you suppose she'll comply?

16
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,800
What shall we do, then?

17
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:29,520
Listen,

18
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,360
the annual bazaar at the capital gate

19
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,280
will open soon.

20
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,280
Perhaps we should invite Feng Wu along

21
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,240
to enjoy a diversion?

22
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:36,480
Good idea.

23
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,120
I'm going to tell her right now.

24
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:41,800
Mr. Xuan Yi,

25
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,280
why did you come here alone?

26
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,200
A Spiritual Elder has arrived
in the capital today.

27
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:47,640
His Highness and Young Master Feng were asked

28
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:48,720
to greet him.

29
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:51,800
What business have you come here for?

30
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,280
My grandpa Spiritual Elder Fang's
birthday is around the corner,

31
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,080
and I want to get him a present.

32
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:59,240
He's always been interested
in miscellaneous branches of study.

33
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:01,760
When I was in the Border City, I heard

34
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,240
that Feng Wu knows some medical skills,

35
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,400
so I want to ask Miss Feng Wu to help me

36
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,720
draw a chart of acupoints and meridians.

37
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,120
Well...

38
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:10,840
Where is Feng Wu?

39
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:14,400
She has been in a mood lately.

40
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,680
I see.

41
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,040
And this is...

42
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:30,920
Miss Zhao Ge?

43
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:37,160
So you remember me, Mr. Xuan Yi.

44
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:38,720
Of course.

45
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,560
When I pass by other girls,

46
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:43,040
all that I can smell is the scent of rouge.

47
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,600
But you're different, Miss Zhao Ge.

52
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,840

Mr. Xuan Yi.

56
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,680
It wasn't a big deal. Don't mention it.

Oh, right.

60
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,360
We were going to invite our Young lady along

61
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,950
to the Xianyang Bazaar at the city gate.

62
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,560
Would you care to join us, Mr. Xuan Yi?

♪There were not only sorrows in the wind♪

Good. I'm off to tell Young Lady.

66
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:36,400
Qiu...

67
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,360
Miss Zhao Ge.

68
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:48,320
Are you feeling alright?

69
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:52,480
I'm fine.

70
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:03,560
Your Majesty,

71
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:05,040
you've gone out of your way

72
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,840
to greet him at the gate in person.

73
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,800
Spiritual Elder Wu must be deeply moved

74
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,240
upon hearing it.

75
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:12,200
It's no trouble at all.

76
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,600
I'm doing this to show my sincerity.

77
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:15,800
Your Majesty,

78
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:17,480
you did all this

79
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,400
to guide the way for me.

80
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,920
I hope my dream will soon come true

81
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,680
so that I'll be worthy of the efforts

82
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,080
Your Majesty has made for me.

83
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:30,720
I felt as if I'd known you for ages

84
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,640
the first time I met you.

85
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,280
If Wu Youdao agrees

86
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:37,320
to take you as his disciple,

87
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:40,600
then my effort will pay off.

88
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:46,160
I'll do my best.

89
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,200
Masks. Masks for sale.

90
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,160
It's fun.

91
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,840
Zhao Ge, take a look.

92
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:06,800
This place is fun.

93
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:08,880
It's full of trinkets I've never seen before.

94
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:09,480
Yeah.

95
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,120
Look at that.

96
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,480
Come here, lassie. Take a look.

97
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,240
Listen.

98
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:15,240
You can find loads of trinkets at the bazaar.

99
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,040
It's homemade.

100
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,960
It's very popular. Take a look.

101
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:20,560
Look at this.

102
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,840
It's a conjuring trick. It's magic.

103
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,840
I watched it closely,
but still couldn't figure it out.

104
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,120
Really?

105
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:27,480
Check it out.

106
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:29,380
No charge if it doesn't taste good.

107
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:31,520
You've no idea, right?

108
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:32,720
Watch carefully.

109
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:36,980
Steamed bun, steaming hot bun.

110
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,400
If you like it, Mister,

111
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,440
we could give you a discount.

112
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,280
It is interesting,

113
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:43,280
but it's not practical.

114
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,720
Why don't you check out the other stuff?

115
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,440
Awesome.

116
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:48,100
No charge if it doesn't taste good.

117
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:49,180
Come and take a look.

118
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:50,940
Welcome to try it.

119
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:53,020
All of these are ancestral crafts.
Come and take a look.

120
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:54,500
Steamed bun, steamed bun.

121
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:58,720
Come and take a look.

122
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,640
Sir, what is this?

123
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:05,280
It's a green glaze stone native
to my hometown.

124
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,200
It can serve as a lucky charm

125
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,880
and protect you from the attack
of demonic beasts.

126
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,720
Really?

127
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,400
How much is it?

128
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,400
I'll have three.

129
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:15,680
-Here you are, lassie.
-Thank you, sir.

130
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:16,640
Qiu Ling,

131
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,240
why did you buy those stones?

132
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:19,360
The merchant said

133
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,960
they could protect us from harm.

134
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,960
Miss Zhao Ge, this one is for you.

135
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,600
I wish you safe and well.

136
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,000
Thank you, Qiu Ling.

137
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,520
And these two are for our Young lady

138
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:35,160
and Madam.

139
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,560
What about you?

140
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,160
You guys are all that I need.

141
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:40,360
Miss Qiu Ling is so kind.

142
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,120
My Lady.

143
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,680
She is here.

144
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,000
My Lady.

145
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,240
My Lady.

146
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:56,640
I'll have one, please.

147
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:58,960
Have a look at this, please.

148
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,120
Here.

149
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:11,840
Come on. Take a look.

150
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:20,680
My Lady.

151
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:21,920
My Lady.

152
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,560
You came.

153
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:24,840
Qiu Ling.

154
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,040
Make way.

155
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:30,920
Get out of the way.

156
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,920
The horse is spooked.

157
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,280
Make way.

158
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,840
Get out of the way.

159
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,480
The horse is spooked.

160
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:42,880
Make way.

161
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,280
Out of the way.

162
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:52,600
The horse is spooked.

163
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,120
Gao Wei,

164
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,480
what's going on?

165
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,960
There seems to be a ruckus ahead.

166
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:02,800
Your Majesty,

167
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,440
I'll go check it out right now.

168
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,240
Your Majesty,

169
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,920
please allow me to join him.

170
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:24,720
Make way.

171
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,520
Out of the way.

172
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:28,720
Make way.

173
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:30,560
Out of the way.

174
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:32,040
Mr. Xuan Yi.

175
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:34,800
The horse is spooked.

176
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,280
Are you alright, sir?

177
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:45,760
Out of the way.

178
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,680
-My son.
-Mom.

179
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,160
Dear me.

180
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,040
My Lady.

181
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:28,880
Take care.

182
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:47,600
You gave me a fright.

183
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:48,680
Come on.

184
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:49,760
Miss.

185
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,360
Thanks for your help, sir.

186
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,520
Next time you want
to risk your own life to save others,

187
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,440
you should deal with the root of the problem,

188
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:00,120
or you'll just get yourself killed.

189
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:04,200
Sir,

190
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:05,840
I'm much obliged to you.

191
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:08,080
May I know your name, please?

192
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,040
You must be

193
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,400
Ageless Child

194
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:15,000
Wu Youdao, Spiritual Elder.

195
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:50,800
Greetings, Your Majesties.

196
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:53,520
Supervisor Wu, you must have had

197
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:54,800
a tough journey.

198
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,840
Your Majesty is so kind.

199
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:57,920
I'm fine.

200
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,160
Supervisor Wu, now that you've arrived,

201
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,320
why don't you take office at Junwu Academy

202
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:05,640
in a few days?

203
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:11,560
I heard you've been writing books

204
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:14,400
and teaching commoners
the way of cultivation.

205
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,560
You must have gathered much experience.

206
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,960
I wonder if I could have the pleasure

207
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,160
of discussing it with you, Supervisor Wu.

208
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:22,920
I've got nothing accomplished

209
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,440
to speak of,

210
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,880
except for some small tricks.

211
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:30,760
How would I dare show off
my incompetence before Your Majesty?

212
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:32,160
Well...

213
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,640
Old Man Wu is right.

214
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:36,120
He's not bad at teaching juniors,

215
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,440
but how dare he show off

216
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,680
before Your Majesty?

217
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:42,800
Please have mercy on him, Your Majesty.

218
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:57,400
I know what Your Highness has in mind,

219
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:59,600
but Old Man Wu is very stubborn.

220
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,360
I've known him for ages,

221
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:03,560
and I know his temperament.

222
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,440
If you try to rope him in,

223
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:07,320
you'll only get the opposite effect.

224
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:10,560
You'd better wait and see.

225
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:14,840
Supervisor Wu,

226
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,440
sorry to disturb you.

227
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:20,800
My name is Zuo Qingluan.

228
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,240
I met you at the bazaar earlier today.

229
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,920
May I have a word with you, sir?

230
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,000
What is it?

231
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,280
But for your help at the city gate today,

232
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,160
many innocent people would have

233
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,800
fallen victim to that spooked horse.

234
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:37,360
I really admire your strong sense of justice,

235
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,280
Supervisor Wu.

236
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,520
I hope you could consider

237
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,880
taking me as your disciple.

238
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,440
You're an eloquent girl,

239
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:49,440
I see.

240
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:51,240
What strong sense of justice?

241
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:56,160
I happened to be there

242
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:58,320
and did a small favor in passing.

243
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:00,240
You saw it as a small favor,

244
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:02,920
but it saved many people's lives.

245
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:05,600
I hope you could give me a chance.

246
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:07,160
I'll work really hard

247
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:09,000
to live up to your name.

248
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:24,080
Supervisor Wu, what was that about?

249
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:27,120
A move from Celestial Palace.

250
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,040
Lassie,

251
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,040
you already have a master,

252
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:33,320
so why did you ask to be my disciple?

253
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,720
If word of it should get out,

254
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:38,000
I'd have to owe Celestial Palace

255
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:40,480
a favor.

256
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:45,840
I've no intention to stir up trouble,

257
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,160
so let's forget it. Forget it.

258
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,000
I did learn after Celestial Palace,

259
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:52,120
but the key to cultivation

260
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:54,400
is a comprehensive study of various schools.

261
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:58,560
The communication between different schools

262
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,280
is in line with the motto
of Celestial Palace.

263
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:04,520
This won't put you in an awkward situation.

264
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,680
It's been my desire to better myself.

265
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:08,680
Besides,

266
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,320
I've admired you

267
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,040
for a long time.

268
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:13,760
Enough.

269
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,320
If you want to better yourself,

270
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:19,600
you should study at Junwu Academy.

271
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
You can find plenty of learned men there.

272
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:23,920
I'm the supervisor of the academy,

273
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:25,480
but it's just a sinecure

274
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:27,800
to guard the Library Pavilion.

275
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:31,080
I don't think I'm capable
enough to teach you.

276
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,080
See?

277
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,040
Thanks for your advice, sir.

278
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:06,440
This is odd.

279
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,640
Why do I find that Spiritual Elder Wu

280
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:09,800
somewhat familiar?

281
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:15,200
I don't think I'd met him before.

282
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,080
Frankly speaking,

283
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,920
I find him familiar, too.

284
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,360
Yeah?

285
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,160
But...

286
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:27,760
Where had we met before?

287
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:30,640
I remember.

288
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:31,600
That move of his

289
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,400
reminded me of Lord Mu.

290
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:34,440
Master?

291
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:39,200
Do they know each other?

292
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:41,080
Junwu Academy was founded

293
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:42,800
by Lord Mu.

294
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:45,520
All spells in the world
remain essentially the same.

295
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:47,880
Similar moves are not that uncommon.

296
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:50,040
Junwu Academy was founded by Master?

297
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:50,400
Yeah.

298
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:51,280
Why have you never told me

299
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:52,560
about something so important?

300
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:54,760
You've never asked me.

301
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:59,320
Master.

302
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:00,800
Wu Youdao.

303
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:03,160
Could it be that my admission

304
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,120
to Junwu Academy is a required step

305
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:07,360
in the quest for the Star Shard?

306
00:17:12,830 --> 00:17:13,520
My Lady,

307
00:17:14,110 --> 00:17:15,400
His Highness and his men have arrived.

308
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:16,520
They're at the gate.

309
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:36,320
How dare we bother
Your Highness with this trifle?

310
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:38,400
Don't mention it.

311
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:39,760
It's no bother.

312
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:45,800
I know

313
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:48,560
that it was inconsiderate of me

314
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,720
to ask you to get into Junwu Academy

315
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,200
without discussing it with you first.

316
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:55,960
But you must have learned from recent events

317
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:58,160
that Junwu is the best choice

318
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:00,160
if you want to strengthen your spirit energy

319
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,000
and become a senior-rank
spiritual practitioner

320
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,200
or even a Great Spiritual Master.

321
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,160
I know.

322
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,040
You've met Supervisor Wu Youdao.

323
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:13,560
Don't you admire

324
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:14,760
his way of cultivation?

325
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:15,640
So?

326
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,520
Are you still loath to sit for the exam?

327
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:20,920
You're right,

328
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,920
but I've much cramming to do

329
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:26,440
if I want to pass the exam.

330
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:27,600
Yes.

331
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,320
I've got everything ready for you.

332
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:31,080
Look.

333
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,160
You'll pass the written exam

334
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,680
if you memorize them.

335
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:35,600
Um...

336
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:40,400
Jun Linyuan,

337
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:42,720
you knew I'd say yes, didn't you?

338
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:45,000
You...

339
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:47,400
Tell me. Didn't you?

340
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:52,020
(Feng's Mansion)

341
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,120
How I envy you.

342
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:09,200
You're so relaxed.

343
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,240
Earlier today you said

344
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,000
you'd apply for Junwu Academy with me

345
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,240
and that we'd study for the exam together.

346
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:02,800
Come out.

347
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:07,960
The girl inside is sound asleep

348
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:10,160
while the boy outside is idling about.

349
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,400
The exam is around the corner,

350
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:13,760
and woe is me.

351
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:15,800
Why would you need to study?

352
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:18,520
Actual combat experience
is the key in fighting.

353
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:20,720
Come on. Let me take you for a stroll

354
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,080
and get someone to compare strength with you.

355
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:23,600
Great Spiritual Master like you

356
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,200
can enter the academy
without taking the exam;

357
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:26,560
so please leave me alone.

358
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:28,320
Guess

359
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:29,840
what funny scene I saw

360
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:31,120
on my way here.

361
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,360
Bro,

362
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:34,280
I've got so much cramming to do.

363
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:36,000
If you're really bored,

364
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,760
go and pick a fight with Jun Linyuan.

365
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:40,520
Wait a moment.

366
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:41,600
Listen,

367
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,400
as I was passing by the tea house,

368
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:46,040
I saw Xuan Yi's grandfather

369
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:47,240
Spiritual Elder Fang having a row

370
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:48,840
with that Wu Youdao.

371
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:50,760
If only you'd seen

372
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:52,000
the intense atmosphere there.

373
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:53,440
What a ridiculous scene.

374
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,640
They had a row?

375
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:56,400
Yeah.

376
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,160
I eavesdropped for a little while,

377
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,200
and learned that the two men

378
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:00,760
and Dean Ning of Junwu Academy,

379
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:01,920
are old friends.

380
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:04,040
Wu Youdao and Dean Ning

381
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:06,040
are childhood friends.

382
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:07,920
And Spiritual Elder Fang and Wu Youdao

383
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:09,720
are often at each other's throat privately.

384
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:10,760
It's hilarious.

385
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:13,880
Besides,

386
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,000
another person

387
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,280
is also an old friend of theirs.

388
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:17,520
Can you make a guess?

389
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:18,880
Who?

390
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,080
Old Man Ba.

391
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:22,040
The man who helped you

392
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:23,600
refine elixir in the Border City.

393
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:25,680
So? Isn't that a surprise?

394
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:27,600
Old Man Ba?

395
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:30,760
I know he's acquainted with Dean Ning,

396
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,400
but I didn't expect

397
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:33,920
he's also friends with Wu Youdao.

398
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:36,080
An elixir-refining old man

399
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:39,160
should be friends with two most prestigious

400
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,040
masters of today.

401
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:41,640
Don't you find it interesting?

402
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:46,440
I see.

403
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:51,920
No, no.

404
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:01,600
Supervisor Wu,

405
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:04,040
your shoulders need more exercise

406
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,520
and massages.

407
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:07,440
Well,

408
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:09,640
you're really good at this.

409
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:10,960
Tell me.

410
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:14,000
Do you have a favor to ask?

411
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,320
No, I don't.

412
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,640
I'm just showing due respect,

413
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:19,560
since you're Old Man Ba's friend.

414
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:21,000
It was the least I could do.

415
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:22,760
What did Old Man Ba say about me?

416
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:25,240
He called you

417
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:26,560
a resolute,

418
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:27,760
straightforward

419
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,240
and extremely gifted man.

420
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,160
He also called you...

421
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:32,360
What did he call me?

422
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:34,000
An exceptional genius.

423
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,480
He had a very high opinion of you.

424
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:40,320
Good.

425
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,240
Well,

426
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,160
you're different

427
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:45,280
from other youngsters.

428
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:47,360
Old Man Ba didn't instruct you

429
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:49,800
for nothing.

430
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:51,560
OK.

431
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:52,480
There.

432
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:57,020
(Chart of Acupoints and Meridians)

433
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:58,800
Yes. Yes. Good.

434
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,120
This is outrageous.

435
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:03,040
You drew that Chart
of Acupoints and Meridians for me.

436
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:04,640
Who gave him the right to snatch it?

437
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,040
That's what I told him.

438
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:07,960
But Supervisor Wu explained

439
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:09,840
that you're such good friends

440
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,040
that you share everything with each other,

441
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:13,760
so he insisted on keeping it.

442
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:14,960
No.

443
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:17,680
I've got to get it back.

444
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,200
You're not playing some trick, are you?

445
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:29,040
I don't know what you're talking about.

446
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:31,000
I've got to confront Supervisor Wu.

447
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,320
Don't ruin your grandpa's great plan.

448
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:04,040
Old Man Wu.

449
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:07,480
To what do I owe the pleasure?

450
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:09,840
You're playing chess with yourself?

451
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,120
Let me keep you company.

452
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,280
No, thanks.

453
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,560
I like playing chess with myself.

454
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:21,880
Who asked you to move my pieces? You...

455
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:24,080
You've ruined my game.

456
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:27,080
You're hesitant even
when playing chess with yourself?

457
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:28,280
No wonder you've made

458
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:30,120
little progress in chess over the years.

459
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:32,800
Am I not allowed to enjoy

460
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:34,040
playing chess with myself?

461
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,360
You enjoy it?

462
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:37,200
But I don't.

463
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:41,040
Why is the Chart of Acupoints
and Meridians Feng Wu drew for me

464
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:43,160
in your place?

465
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,480
Get over yourself.

466
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:46,400
Old Man Fang,

467
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:47,920
you're mistaken.

468
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:49,840
The girl drew it as a gift for me.

469
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:50,520
Bah.

470
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:52,240
Let's not mince words.

471
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:54,060
(Chart of Acupoints and Meridians)

472
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:02,160
In my absence,

473
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:04,120
you've become a robber.

474
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:33,160
So this is what you aimed for.

475
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,280
Tell you what,

476
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:36,600
all men in the world

477
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:38,120
have one weakness in common.

478
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:40,120
What weakness?

479
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:41,720
They act on provocations.

480
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:43,800
What do you mean?

481
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:45,800
Keep it down.

482
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:39,880
What strong spirit energy.

483
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:51,880
That checkerboard seems off.

484
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:53,640
It's more like

485
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:55,360
a spirit energy map

486
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:57,520
than a checkerboard.

487
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:07,000
With the Five Centers facing up
towards the Gate of Danquan,

488
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:10,280
you find yourself shrouded
in mist in a faraway land.

489
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:31,040
Even if the White Horse
can't lead the way for you,

490
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:35,960
the soothing Way shall reside in you.

491
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:39,720
I see.

492
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:14,720
Miss Zhao Ge.

493
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:17,760
Mr. Xuan Yi.

494
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:19,760
Why did you ask

495
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:21,040
to meet me here?

496
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,120
I...

497
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:23,720
I was thinking

498
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:26,440
that maybe we could study together

499
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:29,040
and encourage each other

500
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:31,480
since the entrance exam is drawing near.

501
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:33,320
Studying is a good idea,

502
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:36,200
but do we have to encourage each other?

503
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:37,520
We'll just do as we ordinarily would.

504
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:42,640
I've never been gifted in cultivation.

505
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:45,200
I'd be overjoyed if I could be admitted

506
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,120
to the academy

507
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:48,680
with you and Feng Wu,

508
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:50,800
but I guess

509
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:53,080
my chances are slim.

510
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:54,920
So I wonder if you could

511
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:57,320
give me a word of encouragement

512
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:59,200
before the exam.

513
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:02,360
It's OK if you're not so inclined.

514
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:05,000
I'll try my best anyway. I'll study hard.

515
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:17,360
Miss Zhao Ge,

516
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,480
fortune favors those who persevere

517
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:21,600
in their studies in spite of hardships.

518
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:23,160
I wish you good luck

519
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:24,720
on your exam.

520
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:34,760
Mr. Xuan Yi,

521
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:36,120
I'm not very good with words.

522
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:38,200
All the best on your exam.

523
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:40,320
I hope we'll see each other at Junwu Academy.

524
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:47,040
Miss Zhao Ge.

525
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:48,560
Miss Zhao Ge.

526
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:49,920
I'm alright.

527
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:54,400
I'm alright.

528
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:01,440
Miss Zhao Ge.

529
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:02,880
Let's make a deal.

530
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:06,120
I'll grant you a wish

531
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:07,760
if you get admitted to Junwu Academy.

532
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:09,120
Seriously?

533
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:10,280
Of course.

534
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:11,280
Tell me your wish.

535
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:12,440
I...

536
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,920
I'll tell you

537
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:21,560
when I pass the entrance exam.

538
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:23,320
OK.

539
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:25,560
Mr. Xuan Yi,

540
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:27,000
with your promise

541
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:29,800
I'll study harder for the exam.

542
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:39,440
The dishes are getting cold.

543
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:40,640
Let's enjoy them.

544
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:41,600
Come on.

545
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:45,640
It took me hours to prepare them for you.

546
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:51,880
Miss Zhao Ge,

547
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,720
don't waste time since you've decided

548
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:55,200
to study for the exam.

549
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:56,760
Let's get started.

550
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:15,600
Your Majesty,

551
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:16,880
dinner has gone cold.

552
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:19,760
Shall I get it reheated?

553
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:21,800
We'll wait a little longer.

554
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:23,040
Yes, Your Majesty.

555
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:34,160
Your Majesty.

556
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:36,440
Where is he?

557
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:37,560
Your Majesty,

558
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:40,720
Supervisor Wu said
he had some paperwork to do

559
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:43,000
and asked me to thank Your Majesty.

560
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:44,200
He said

561
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:46,360
he'd join Your Majesty another time.

562
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:48,800
I'm so sorry, Your Majesty.

563
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:50,880
Wu Youdao is so ungrateful.

564
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:52,600
I'll go there again

565
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:54,520
and drag him here.

566
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:56,880
Forget it.

567
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:04,480
Qingluan,

568
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:07,600
what do you think

569
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:10,520
we should do now?

570
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:13,880
Wu Youdao is a very capable man.

571
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:15,960
It'll be a shame

572
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:17,480
if we can't win his support.

573
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:19,840
I'll put in more effort

574
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:21,560
to win him over.

575
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:26,240
You're still quite naïve.

576
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:28,560
Sometimes

577
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:31,080
effort doesn't work.

578
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:34,320
We must resort to some means.

579
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,360
If we really can't win him over,

580
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:39,680
we might as well destroy him.

581
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:43,480
You can go now.

582
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:48,480
Yes, Your Majesty.

583
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:59,040
It might be beyond your power
to defeat Wu Youdao,

584
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:02,760
whose spirit energy is very strong.

585
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,560
He's a great talent.

586
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:08,120
I'd grant him privilege and status

587
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:11,520
if he could serve me.

588
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:14,320
What a shame.

589
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:19,920
Visit his place

590
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:22,400
with shadow guards later today.

591
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:25,440
Does Your Majesty mean...

592
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:29,360
If he won't serve me,

593
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,760
he mustn't serve Jun Linyuan, either.

594
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:34,640
You know

595
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:36,960
what I mean.

596
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:39,560
I'm on it.

597
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:16,260
(Chart of Acupoints and Meridians)

598
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:18,920
The acupoints and meridians
are amazing indeed.

599
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:22,000
I'm impressed by Feng Wu.

600
00:34:59,670 --> 00:35:01,400
How dare you rascals

601
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:04,440
ambush me?

602
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,520
The magic incense is colorless and odorless.

603
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:11,240
Once you inhale it,

604
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:13,080
you won't be able to use your spirit energy.

605
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:16,560
If you try mustering your energy,
you'll only hurt your five internal organs.

606
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:19,680
Even an Ageless Child like you

607
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:23,000
will have to die in my hands today.

608
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:24,840
Who sent you here?

609
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:26,240
Supervisor Wu,

610
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:28,680
why did you have to set yourself

611
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:32,600
against someone formidable?

612
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:34,880
Kill him.

613
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:41,960
Bravo, Ageless Child.

614
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:43,000
You're still so strong

615
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:45,160
even in this state.

616
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:47,160
Get him.

617
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:56,040
Catch him. Don't let him get away.

618
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:08,480
What's the matter?

619
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:10,240
You've been absent-minded lately.

620
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:13,440
We've been shadowed

621
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:15,200
by Darknight Court henchmen

622
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:16,040
ever since we left Frozen Forest.

623
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:19,040
There must be a traitor in our clan.

624
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:22,320
But I'm utterly clueless.

625
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:24,080
That's why

626
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:26,520
you let Feng Wu off easily

627
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:28,320
for stealing the Celestial Fruit.

628
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,360
Compared with the gift for His Majesty,

629
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:33,240
the power behind the traitor
is even more troublesome.

630
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:34,920
That's why I wanted to invite

631
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:37,320
an outside force to help us.

632
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:39,600
You mean the person

633
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:41,080
who attracted Holy Queen Gao's attention

634
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:43,120
upon arriving in the capital?

635
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:29,920
Poisonous dart from Darknight Court.

636
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:33,120
Who'd have thought

637
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:36,800
that Darknight Court

638
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:39,640
could be so rampant
in the capital these days?

639
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:41,360
Well done, Supervisor Wu.

640
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:42,880
You're a man of the world.

641
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:45,280
But it's too late.

642
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:52,080
Supervisor Wu.

643
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:53,000
Jun Linyuan.

644
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:53,520
Get them.

645
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:04,240
Let's go.

646
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:15,080
Retreat.

647
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:20,900
(Feng's Mansion)

648
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:23,080
What are you doing here?

649
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:24,680
What happened?

650
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:25,480
Hush.

651
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:26,640
I'll explain it to you later.

652
00:38:58,200 --> 00:38:58,840
Supervisor Wu,

653
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:01,520
who'd hate you so much

654
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:03,800
as to lay murderous hands on you?

655
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:10,560
Do you need me to investigate it for you?

656
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:12,520
Forget it.

657
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:22,320
I've abandoned worldly concerns for ages,

658
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,680
and I can protect myself.

659
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:28,440
If the perpetrator

660
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:31,440
fails a time or two,

661
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:34,840
they'll give up the attempt eventually.

662
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:38,280
But...

663
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:43,240
Thanks for helping me out today.

664
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:45,120
I know

665
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,560
Your Highness

666
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:50,720
has always wanted me to side with you.

667
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:54,760
It would be my great honor

668
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:57,720
to assist a bright young man like you,

669
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:00,760
but

670
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:03,240
I'm too old

671
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:06,400
for fights and feuds.

672
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:09,880
I hope Your Highness

673
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:13,080
could understand me.

674
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:16,480
I understand.

675
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:20,120
It's been my wishful thinking.

676
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:25,160
If Your Highness remains determined

677
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:28,280
and always puts the people's interests first,

678
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:29,800
I believe

679
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:31,640
that Your Highness

680
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:34,400
will be able to lead the Junwu Clan to peace

681
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:36,960
and prosperity in due course.

682
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:39,160
I'll bear your instruction in mind.

683
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:46,160
Supervisor Wu,

684
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:48,160
please have a good rest.

685
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:49,680
It's perfectly safe here.

686
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:10,480
Holy Queen Gao.
