00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:40,580
(Episode 10)

3
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,640
I'm sorry about this.

4
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,360
I will marry you as soon as possible.

5
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,480
I won't treat you shabbily in every aspect.

6
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:09,400
I...

7
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,520
I'll be responsible for you.

8
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:19,960
No need.

9
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,320
You don't have

10
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:23,800
to talk about marrying me.

11
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:25,200
I don't want to

12
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:26,320
go to the capital
where I'm apt to get into trouble.

13
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:27,440
But I...

14
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,120
Stop talking about it.

15
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,240
Continue your life
as if nothing had happened.

16
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:31,960
Just go.

17
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,800
Avoid being seen by anyone.

18
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,440
I don't hope

19
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:37,000
others come to me due to jealousy.

20
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,720
I can't do that.

21
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:41,280
I admit what I did.

22
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:31,840
It's you.

23
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:34,520
My Lady.

24
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:35,800
My Lady.

25
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,120
What happened, Qiu Ling?

26
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:37,920
Madam is missing.

27
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:38,840
What?

28
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:41,560
Where can she go?

29
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,240
She never goes out.

30
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,680
Feng Wu,

31
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,480
you're chasing him in such a hurry.

32
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,480
Do you still deny your wishful thinking?

33
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,120
I come to think of it.

34
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,920
Did you put potion
into the fake Phoenix Tea

35
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,040
you gave me yesterday?

36
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:57,520
What potion?

37
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,640
I can't understand what you're saying.

38
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:00,920
Are you ready?

39
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,160
We'll leave in two hours.

40
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:03,840
Feng Wu,

41
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,080
why are you here?

42
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,920
Where will you go?

43
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,200
Surely the capital.

44
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,520
Who will go back to the capital?

45
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,680
Don't you know

46
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,800
about His Highness Jun's leaving?

47
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,520
It seems they kept it a secret
from you deliberately

48
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:18,160
and wanted to leave you here.

49
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,640
They left four hours ago.

50
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,560
Before His Highness Jun left,

51
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,440
he specially talked with me.

52
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,160
-You...
-Tell me

53
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:30,040
whether you hid my mom.

54
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,600
You misunderstood. You misunderstood.

55
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,360
It's His Highness Jun who took your mom away.

56
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,280
Now they're on the way to the capital.

57
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,520
Jun Linyuan?

58
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:38,440
Yes.

59
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:39,200
Why?

60
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,080
We don't know.

61
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,360
He left in a hurry early in the morning.

62
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:46,840
Go.

63
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:49,560
My Lady,

64
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,120
they left a letter before they left.

65
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,480
I don't know it's related to Madam,

66
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,880
so I've never opened it.

67
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,720
We wanted to stay a few more days,

68
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,160
but there was an urgent letter
from the capital,

69
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,520
so we had to rush back.

70
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:03,440
Boss Jun said that

71
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,960
as the future heir to the Feng family,

72
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,360
you can't just stay in the Border City.

73
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,320
And I also hate to part from you,

74
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,040
so we took your mom away.

75
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,680
In this case,
you'll also come to the capital.

76
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,120
Don't worry.

77
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,160
I'll take good care of your mom all the way.

78
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,360
-Then see you in the capital.
-What does the letter say?

79
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:17,640
Yours, Feng Xun.

80
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,120
Go to pack up.

81
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:19,920
We'll go to the capital.

82
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:20,360
OK.

83
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:29,920
Madam.

84
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,560
You'll go to the capital.

85
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:00,320
I'll set out an hour later.

86
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,520
Does anyone threaten you?

87
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,240
Well, don't worry.

88
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,360
With me,

89
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:10,360
no one dares to bully you.

90
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,360
Jun Linyuan.

91
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,520
Knowing I don't want to leave the Border City,

92
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,920
he took away my mom.

93
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,440
I'm afraid they'll mess around

94
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,280
and the Feng family in the capital

95
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:22,960
may embarrass my mom.

96
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,360
Do you think he is so foxy?

97
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,360
Wait for me in a minute.

98
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:35,960
Coming.

99
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,200
Take this.

100
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:42,680
What's this?

101
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:45,160
It contains pills

102
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,400
I've made these years.

103
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,720
You may inevitably run into twists and turns

104
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,920
after going to the capital.

105
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:56,160
If you are hurt in fighting,

106
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,560
take one pill.

107
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:01,120
Though it can't make you

108
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:04,040
alive, kicking and as strong as usual,

109
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:07,240
at least it can help you get your second wind

110
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,160
and accelerate healing.

111
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:14,040
Though you take
Nine Transformation Spirit Restoration Pill,

112
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,520
I am still worried

113
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,760
as there is no someone powerful

114
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,040
with you.

115
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,280
Listen.

116
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,520
Be careful

117
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:25,240
all the way.

118
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:28,200
After getting to the capital,
don't act wildly and arrogantly.

119
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:29,240
You should know

120
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:32,560
no matter how strong you are,
there's always someone stronger.

121
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,440
Grandpa Ba.

122
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,400
Stop pinching me.

123
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,560
Listen.

124
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,360
If you didn't usually

125
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,320
communicate with me in medical skill,

126
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:53,160
cook for me,

127
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,040
tell stories to divert me from boredom,
and the like,

128
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,760
I would be unwilling to
talk about this with you.

129
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,120
Then

130
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:01,560
I'm leaving.

131
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,320
OK.

132
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:17,240
Look. Look.

133
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:21,440
You.

134
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,080
Be quick.

135
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:25,080
Everyone is ready, except you.

136
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,480
If we can't catch up with His Highness Jun,

137
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,320
I'll punish you seriously.

138
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,160
Sixth Young Lady, don't worry.

139
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:30,600
My Lady will come out soon.

140
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:32,080
She won't delay your schedule.

141
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,400
Feng Wu who already took
Nine Transformation Spirit Restoration Pill

142
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,840
can practice again.

143
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,840
As she can exert Phoenix Sword,
I can't figure out her strength.

144
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,800
I feel guilty for your trust.

145
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,640
After I go back to the capital,
I'll visit you and apologize to you personally.

146
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:32,200
It turns out I looked down upon you,

147
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,880
who always pretend to be weak.

148
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:41,320
Feng Wu,

149
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,600
I'll wait for you in the capital.

150
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:22,200
We haven't seen anyone after we came out.

151
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:23,840
I asked you to bring more guards,

152
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,880
but you said it would disturb Buddha.

153
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:28,560
What's worse,
you bring two thoughtless maids.

154
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,880
I am Feng Yiran,
the eldest son of the Feng family in the capital.

155
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,680
This is my sister Feng Liu.

156
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,520
I'm glad to meet you here.

157
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,360
May I ask who you are?

158
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,400
It turns out you're
Young Master of the Feng family.

159
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:45,920
How is your mom?

160
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,600
Please excuse my ignorance.

161
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,520
You actually know my mom.

162
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:53,240
We almost know all famous families

163
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,320
in the whole capital.

164
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,720
Your family isn't a great family,

165
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,840
so it's common for us to see your mom.

166
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:02,600
You...

167
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:06,920
Forget it.

168
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,600
You must have practiced outside
for a long time,

169
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,600
so you're naturally ignorant.

170
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,920
This is the wife of
Great Spiritual Master Yan.

171
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:17,080
Just call her Madam Yan.

172
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,320
My husband

173
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:21,480
is the President of Junwu Academy.

174
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,160
Call me Madam Ning.

175
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:27,960
Junwu Academy?

176
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,280
Ignorant bumpkin.

177
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,320
It turns out you're Madam Yan
and Madam Ning.

178
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:37,960
Please excuse my ignorance.

179
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,560
Sorry. Sorry.

180
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,160
Madam Yan,

181
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,520
you're pregnant.

182
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:46,160
Why do you still come here?

183
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:47,960
It's long heard that

184
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:50,160
many people come to burn joss sticks
in the nearby Sumeru Temple.

185
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,320
In the company of Madam Ning,

186
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,920
I come to pray for my unborn child.

187
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:56,560
After such a long journey,

188
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:57,360
we plan to

189
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,120
rest for a night in this post house.

190
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:00,400
By the way,

191
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,480
may I ask

192
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,800
who this girl is?

193
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,640
This is my fifth younger sister,

194
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:06,400
Feng Wu.

195
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:21,400
My Lady,

196
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,680
this post house is so strange.

197
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:25,320
It's actually unoccupied.

198
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:26,720
Well,

199
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:28,600
it's understandable that there're no guests,

200
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,600
but why isn't there

201
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,080
a shopkeeper or any waiters?

202
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:34,680
It's indeed strange.

203
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:37,800
Everything is available here,

204
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:40,000
showing they might not flee in a flurry.

205
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:44,840
Where are you going?

206
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:45,720
Fifth Young Lady,

207
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:47,400
there is something wrong
with this post house,

208
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:49,080
so, Young Master
is organizing us to search.

209
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:50,200
Go.

210
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,280
There is something wrong with it.

211
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:04,040
Young Master,

212
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:06,160
we searched the whole post house

213
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,360
and found no one alive.

214
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:13,680
What happened?

215
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:14,680
Let's go and have a look.

216
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,200
Go and have a look.

217
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:30,800
What's the matter?

218
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:33,640
Look.

219
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,400
What happened?

220
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:48,040
-Please. Spare us.
-Spare our lives.

221
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:49,280
We did nothing bad.

222
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,080
So horrible.

223
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,880
-Please let us go.
-So terrifying.

224
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:53,960
Spare our lives. Please let us go.

225
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,680
Spare our lives. Spare our lives.

226
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,440
What are you talking about?

227
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,240
-Spare our lives.
-Don't be scared.

228
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:06,000
Speak slowly.

229
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,280
What do you know?

230
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,520
We can't stay here.

231
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:10,560
Leave now.

232
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:13,360
-Leave now.
-Young Master, let's leave here now.

233
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,920
The people in the whole post house

234
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,280
must have been eaten.

235
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:20,480
I think

236
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,240
there must be a demonic beast making trouble.

237
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,400
How do you know this?

238
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:29,760
We are

239
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,800
villagers nearby.

240
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,320
In childhood, we heard

241
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,600
this place was not peaceful.

242
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:37,920
Unexpectedly,

243
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,160
we happened to see this time.

244
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:46,680
Madam,

245
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,240
let's go now.

246
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:50,520
We can't stay here.

247
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:51,920
Yes, Madam.

248
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:58,880
Brother.

249
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,240
No matter whether there is a demonic beast,

250
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,160
we shouldn't stay here for long.

251
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,440
Just go.

252
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:08,760
It's about to rain.

253
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,560
We don't want to hurry on
with our journey in rain.

254
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:11,400
You...

255
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,120
What are you doing?

256
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,120
Let them go.

257
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,360
Good-for-nothings.

258
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:20,840
Don't keep these menaces.

259
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:22,960
Well, sister.

260
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,280
Why not also leave?

261
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:27,120
We've had common spirit energy
and cultivation base since childhood.

262
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:28,720
If there is really a demonic beast,

263
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:30,120
I am afraid we're no match for it.

264
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:31,840
And I am pregnant.

265
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,320
We'd better go.

266
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:34,840
Don't be scared.

267
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37,200
It's not far from the capital.

268
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:38,480
I think

269
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,280
fierce demonic beasts

270
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,040
usually don't dare to get together here.

271
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:44,520
You're pregnant.

272
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:45,960
I'm afraid

273
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,360
you can't withstand the hard journey.

274
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,640
Let's just stay here for a night

275
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:50,720
and set out tomorrow.

276
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:55,120
Go.

277
00:15:59,240 --> 00:15:59,840
Brother,

278
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:01,520
if they don't leave,

279
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:03,400
we can't leave them alone.

280
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,160
Or they may stir up enmity

281
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:07,160
after going back to the capital.

282
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:09,280
So troublesome.

283
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:11,760
Heighten your vigilance

284
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:13,320
this night.

285
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:14,760
Yes.

286
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:39,600
Boss Jun,

287
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,240
a heavy rain is coming.

288
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,760
Let's look for a post house
and take shelter from the rain, OK?

289
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:51,360
Madam,

290
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,120
it's going to rain,

291
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:57,320
so we have to hurry.

292
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,840
Your Highness Jun, at your service.

293
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:01,160
But a rain

294
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,040
is coming.

295
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:04,960
Is Feng Wu OK?

296
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,680
They should hurry on
with their journey together.

297
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,480
You know her character,

298
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:09,760
so don't worry a lot.

299
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:11,760
Your Highness Jun, please forgive me.

300
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,640
I always worry about her.

301
00:17:16,110 --> 00:17:16,720
Madam,

302
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,590
don't stand on ceremony.

303
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,480
Just regard me

304
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:21,640
as a common junior later.

305
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:23,310
No.

306
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:26,070
You're Crown Prince by nature.

307
00:17:26,590 --> 00:17:28,830
This is a fact that can never be changed.

308
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:39,760
Stop laughing.

309
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,080
Regard you as a common junior?

310
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:49,760
Boss Jun,

311
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,920
just call her mom.

312
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,360
Women are firm in speech but soft in heart.

313
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:56,160
If you often sweet-talk her,

314
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,680
she'll be happy naturally.

315
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,040
Fortunately, everything is available,

316
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,080
so we can rest comfortably for a night here.

317
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:19,720
There is something wrong.

318
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,320
All women shall rest in this room,

319
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:23,600
so we can take care of each other.

320
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:24,880
All of us shall not act separately.

321
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:28,200
You go get

322
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,560
us a quilt.

323
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:39,760
Go.

324
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:40,840
Go ahead.

325
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:44,920
Sister,

326
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:46,760
don't be so rude.

327
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,280
Sorry.

328
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,600
She has been proud
and arrogant since childhood,

329
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,080
so, please forgive her.

330
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:55,600
Madam Yan, it doesn't matter.

331
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:56,800
We should take care of

332
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,760
each other outside.

333
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:00,680
Go.

334
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:03,400
Well.

335
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:06,040
Sister.

336
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:07,080
What's wrong?

337
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:08,240
Madam Yan,

338
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:09,200
what's wrong with you?

339
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:11,680
Come and help her.

340
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:14,080
Madam Yan, lie down.

341
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,040
Quickly. Sit down first. Sit down.

342
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:18,720
Slowly.

343
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:20,920
Take care.

344
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:28,680
Sister.

345
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:30,600
Hold on. Breathe deep.

346
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,560
Yes. Breathe deep.

347
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:33,400
Don't be scared.

348
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:35,680
Feng Wu, can you handle this?

349
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:36,560
Don't be scared.

350
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:38,120
-Don't be scared. I am here.
-Qiu Ling,

351
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,080
go get hot water.

352
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:40,960
Go now. Go now.

353
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:45,120
Madam Ning, if you had been kind

354
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,160
to your maids in normal times,

355
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:48,240
we would have

356
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,600
helpers now.

357
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:50,800
You even dare to blame me now.

358
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:51,800
The guards of your family

359
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:52,960
-even couldn't stop the maids...
-Enough.

360
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:54,520
Now Madam Yan needs peace and quiet.

361
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:56,000
Go out.

362
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:59,120
Go out.

363
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:04,360
Sister.

364
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,560
Stop walking back and forth. I feel dizzy.

365
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:32,000
Two hours has passed.

366
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,240
Why hasn't Madam Yan given birth?

367
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,200
If she has an accident,

368
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,120
our whole family
can't take the responsibility,

369
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:38,040
let alone you and me.

370
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:39,080
Don't be afraid.

371
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:41,200
It's Feng Wu
who is helping her to give birth.

372
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:42,480
If she has an accident,

373
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:43,920
it has nothing to do with us.

374
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:53,880
What's the matter?

375
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:57,840
Go.

376
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:01,480
Charge.

377
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:10,080
Why is there such a
senior-rank demonic beast?

378
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:17,960
Don't stand still.

379
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:19,040
Charge.

380
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:50,600
My Lady,

381
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:51,640
-there is something wrong.
-Sister.

382
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:52,320
My Lady.

383
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,080
Calm down. Speak slowly.

384
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:57,360
There is really a demonic beast outside.

385
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:58,120
Really.

386
00:22:58,600 --> 00:22:59,920
Many guards were killed.

387
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,400
Feng Wu, go now.

388
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:05,400
Leave me alone.

389
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:06,520
We can't do that.

390
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:07,960
It's the critical moment.

391
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:09,160
Sister,

392
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,160
go with Feng Wu.

393
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:13,720
I,

394
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:15,680
I am afraid

395
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:17,880
I may die.

396
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:22,520
Feng Wu, please.

397
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,160
Save her.

398
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:25,720
She is a kind person

399
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:28,360
who has been merciful since childhood.

400
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:31,560
She shouldn't die in this way.

401
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:34,400
Please.

402
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:54,600
Madam, I'll first fight with
the demonic beast outside.

403
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:55,960
Don't speak.

404
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,240
Save some physical strength.

405
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,880
Madam Ning, hold Madam Yan's hands

406
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,000
and transport some spirit energy
to her from time to time.

407
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:02,480
OK.

408
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:04,240
Well, sister.

409
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:05,600
My Lady, no.

410
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:06,880
Your spirit energy is so low

411
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:07,840
that you can't resist

412
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,240
such a senior-rank demonic beast outside.

413
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,920
It's simply like a flying moth
darting into the fire.

414
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:11,800
Qiu Ling,

415
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:13,000
none of us can leave safely

416
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:14,400
in this case.

417
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:15,720
Why not let me try outside?

418
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:17,320
Let Madam Yan give birth safely first.

419
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:18,440
Don't worry.

420
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:20,120
The baby will be born soon.

421
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:21,520
Take good care of them.

422
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:23,960
Sister,

423
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:26,520
don't be scared.

424
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:50,120
Feng Liu.

425
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:46,560
I'll go and have a look.

426
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:48,000
Don't stay to wait for me.

427
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:49,120
Continue to go to the capital

428
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:51,080
and ensure to send Madam
to the Feng family safely.

429
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:53,880
Boss Jun,

430
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:55,120
shall I go with you?

431
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:21,720
No.

432
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:41,600
She could even awaken
and enter a higher rank now!

433
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:54,000
Shall we go and help her?

434
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:54,960
No.

435
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:56,680
The enemy is too strong.

436
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
We can only add to the trouble

437
00:26:58,120 --> 00:26:59,560
by our low spirit energy.

438
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:06,680
No.

439
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:09,040
The spirit energy Feng Wu uses
is the same as that of this demonic beast,

440
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:09,880
both being the fire system,

441
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:10,840
so she doesn't have the whip hand.

442
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:12,080
If she can't subdue it,

443
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:13,800
we have to be killed by then.

444
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:15,360
So,

445
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:17,760
let's leave now.

446
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:27,200
Go.

447
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:44,680
Feng Liu.

448
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:50,360
You can't escape.

449
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,360
All of you, old and young,

450
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:53,640
can't escape today.

451
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,600
You actually kill innocent people.

452
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:56,840
I will

453
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:58,680
subdue you today.

454
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:18,120
Go now.

455
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:22,040
Then I'll first go and help Madam Yan.

456
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:45,880
Wanyou Fire.

457
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:48,880
Is this the most valuable treasure
in the demon world

458
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:51,160
which can devour everything?

459
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:52,400
Be careful.

460
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:54,080
It's hard to deal with it.

461
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:03,400
Sister. Sister, try harder.

462
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:06,600
Sister, try harder.

463
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:09,480
-Try harder.
-Madam Yan, hold on.

464
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:10,760
I've seen the baby's head.

465
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:11,760
Try much harder.

466
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:12,800
He will come out.

467
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:16,520
Sister, it's OK.

468
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,480
-Try harder.
-Breathe deep.

469
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:19,320
Madam.

470
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:21,360
Try harder.

471
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,120
Won't you surrender?

472
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:21,880
Don't hurt her.

473
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:52,440
Feng Wu.

474
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:15,800
Jun Linyuan.

475
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,080
Jun Linyuan.

476
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:33,920
Jun Linyuan, wake up.

477
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:39,280
Why did you block for me?

478
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:41,720
Why did you block for me?

479
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:44,760
Jun Linyuan.

480
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:58,400
Don't cry.

481
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:01,240
Did you think I died?

482
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:07,360
Seeing you crying,

483
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:10,600
I thought I went to heaven.

484
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:36,240
He has a small nose.

485
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:46,040
Young Lady asked me
to give these clothes to you.

486
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:50,760
Feng Wu...

487
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:52,080
She said that

488
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,520
it's safe outside.

489
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:55,360
You and Madam Yan

490
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:57,000
can wear these clean clothes.

491
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:58,200
If you get cold,

492
00:32:58,360 --> 00:32:59,800
you'll suffer in the journey tomorrow.

493
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:02,840
Sorry.

494
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:05,600
And

495
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,160
thank you.

496
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:31,600
Goddess Zuo,

497
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:33,160
hearing you're coming,

498
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:34,080
Her Majesty is so happy.

499
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:35,840
She is waiting for you in the hall.

500
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:37,240
Please usher me there.

501
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:39,040
Go with me, please.

502
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:03,040
Your Majesty.

503
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:05,440
Don't stand on ceremony.

504
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,080
Goddess Zuo,

505
00:34:23,710 --> 00:34:24,840
come and sit down.

506
00:34:28,670 --> 00:34:30,440
Your Majesty, just call me Qingluan.

507
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:32,520
Before Your Majesty,

508
00:34:32,710 --> 00:34:34,760
I can't deserve that title.

509
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:53,360
Does Lord Demon come here late at night

510
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:56,190
to meet that big shot?

511
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,230
Who is he?

512
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:03,280
There's a galaxy of talents
in Celestial Palace.

513
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:07,200
Young as you're,
you have such a high cultivation base

514
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:09,400
and treat the people
with benevolence and care.

515
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,680
I like you so much,

516
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:13,920
so I sent someone

517
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:15,000
to invite you here

518
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:16,920
before you ask to come.

519
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:19,640
It's my honor.

520
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:21,520
We're closely related.

521
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:24,280
Do you know

522
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:26,480
which palace I am from?

523
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:27,720
I didn't hear it

524
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:30,280
from my elders.

525
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:33,600
After entering Junwu Divine Hall,

526
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:36,320
I seldom mention my past,

527
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:38,480
so it's natural

528
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:39,840
for you outside not to know it.

529
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:41,440
Were you also

530
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:44,040
a disciple

531
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:46,040
of my Celestial Palace?

532
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:52,320
Your Master is my junior sister.

533
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:54,520
My Master once mentioned

534
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,600
much about her life

535
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:57,960
when she entered
Celestial Palace in childhood.

536
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:00,280
Luckily, she was taken care of by Goddess

537
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:02,640
and a Senior Sister.

538
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:04,160
So, Your Majesty

539
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,120
is that Senior Sister?

540
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:07,520
Yes.

541
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,840
She means First Senior Sister and me.

542
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:15,800
Back then, I followed Mu Jiuzhou to suppress
demonic beasts in the four directions.

543
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:18,280
Later I left Celestial Palace.

544
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,360
With time going,

545
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:22,680
few people

546
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:24,680
know this story.

547
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:28,520
It's a rare encounter between us.

548
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:30,400
Don't stand on ceremony

549
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:32,520
when being with me afterwards.

550
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:34,000
If you have time,

551
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:36,400
come here more frequently.

552
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:37,840
Yes.

553
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:41,880
It's a bit late today.

554
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:43,160
Come

555
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,360
and talk to me some other day.

556
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:51,720
Please have a rest early, Your Majesty.

557
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:54,400
I'm leaving.

558
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:12,800
It seems that

559
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:15,240
she did try hard to get close to you.

560
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:16,600
Never mind.

561
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:19,040
We're short of hands.

562
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:22,800
It will be easier

563
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:26,560
to use a smart girl like her.

564
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:35,920
See you, Goddess Zuo.

565
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:59,400
My Lady, you woke up.

566
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:01,600
Be careful. Don't hurry.

567
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:02,800
Where is Jun Linyuan?

568
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:08,600
After you fainted
due to exhaustion last night,

569
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:10,400
he took care of you all night.

570
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:15,680
Is he alright?

571
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:17,160
Yes.

572
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:19,040
I kept one of the pills

573
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:20,440
Old Man Ba gave you before.

574
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:21,440
He took it.

575
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:24,200
I think he will wake up soon.

576
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:25,360
By the way,

577
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:26,760
I'll decoct herbs for you.

578
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:27,840
Have more rest.

579
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:52,040
He looks exhausted.

580
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:24,080
Am I crazy?

581
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:27,200
What did I do?

582
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:30,120
Why didn't you get

583
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:32,160
-the valuable Wanyou Fire?
-Who?

584
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:33,440
Who's talking?

585
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:36,000
It's me, Colored Phoenix.

586
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:42,880
Why can you speak, Colored Phoenix?

587
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:44,840
Your potential was

588
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:47,200
activated in the fight
against Blood Demon Dragon,

589
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:49,120
so you're a
medium-rank spiritual practitioner.

590
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:50,840
It also gained me new skills.

591
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:51,480
Well.

592
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:54,360
Did you see what I did?

593
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,560
Yes.

594
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:59,680
I really envy you young people.

595
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:01,520
Don't worry.

596
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:03,760
Only you can hear me.

597
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:05,800
And I can hear

598
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:07,200
what you're talking now.

599
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,840
Well, don't tell others

600
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:10,200
what I did just now.

601
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:12,520
Or I'll throw you in the toilet.

602
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:13,480
Do you understand?

603
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:16,000
No, no, no. I won't utter a word.

604
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:17,040
I promise.

605
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:21,640
There is nothing embarrassing
to admit that you like him.

606
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:22,680
I don't like him.

607
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:24,400
You denied it, but your tears betrayed you.

608
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:25,840
Don't insist stubbornly.

609
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:28,640
What, what is Wanyou Fire

610
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:30,480
you just mentioned?

611
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:32,920
After defeating Blood Demon Dragon,

612
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:34,640
Jun Linyuan sucked

613
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:36,680
Wanyou Fire from its body to his.

614
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:40,640
Wanyou Fire was the condensation
of the spirit energy of demonic beasts.

615
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:42,720
If I get it,

616
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:45,080
I can come in and go out
from the spirit ring freely

617
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,480
and normally.

618
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:49,200
How,

619
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:51,160
how should I get it?

620
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,280
You said

621
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:55,480
he had sucked it

622
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:57,400
in his body, right?

623
00:40:58,440 --> 00:40:59,720
Stupid girl.

624
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:02,800
Suck it out in the way he sucked it in.

625
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:06,200
You just tried, right?

626
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:08,000
As long as you kiss him,

627
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:10,640
I'll help you get it.

628
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:13,160
You mean I...

629
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:14,960
There is no time. Don't hesitate.

630
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:16,640
Do it now, or it'll be harder to get it

631
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:18,120
when he wakes up.

632
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:20,960
Don't hesitate. Go now. Go.

633
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:22,280
Go.
