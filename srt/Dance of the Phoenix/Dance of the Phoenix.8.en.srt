2
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:40,340
(Episode 8)

3
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,480
You've taught me for such a long time

4
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:57,680
but I didn't even learn one move.

5
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:58,880
Looks like

6
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:00,560
I'm really not gifted.

7
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:02,400
It's okay. Let's try again.

8
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:04,640
Forget it.

9
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,120
You're a person everyone's proud of

10
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:08,080
and kill demonic beasts
and save people every day.

11
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,200
Don't waste your time with me.

12
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:15,030
Can you really resign yourself to it?

13
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:18,760
You were once a new talent
in the capital everyone envied,

14
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:21,840
an ace among the young cultivators

15
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,000
and Jun Linyuan, a dream for many people,

16
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,960
was someone you were engaged to.

17
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,320
A new talent in the capital , an ace

18
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:31,720
and the engagement.

19
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,160
These

20
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,280
have had nothing to do with me now.

21
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,880
Looks like she has really
lost her cultivation base

22
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,400
and memory.

23
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,760
I've got to go and do something now.

24
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,520
If you don't understand anything,

25
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,600
feel free to ask me.

26
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,080
I will tell you everything I know.

27
00:02:59,160 --> 00:02:59,640
Okay.

28
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:00,760
Thanks.

29
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:16,560
Why's it so hard to be a cultivator?

30
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:21,200
Oh, yes,

31
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:22,560
this can help.

32
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,560
Colored Phoenix,

33
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,600
Little Parrot,

34
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,120
don't play dead.

35
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:30,440
You left me in the lurch but I'm not mad at it.

36
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:31,240
Come out now.

37
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,160
Just come out.

38
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,800
They both ignored me.

39
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:46,920
I'm really a person everyone abandons.

40
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,240
If you keep practicing like this,

41
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,000
you'll never be able to master it.

42
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:21,640
None of your business.

43
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:26,720
Just look at me.

44
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,200
Senior Sister, did Master write us a letter?

45
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,040
What did she say?

46
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:16,320
She asked us to go back to the capital.

47
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:17,720
Go back to the capital?

48
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:18,840
What for?

49
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:21,040
We need to meet someone important.

50
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,920
Here, here. Come.

51
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:25,440
Quickly.

52
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:31,760
Gently. Don't break them.

53
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:34,280
My aunt can't stand the wind. Hurry up.

54
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:39,800
Aunt,

55
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,240
I specially came

56
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:44,040
to apologize to you.

57
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,440
I've been a bad brother

58
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,360
and let Feng Liu cause you so much trouble.

59
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,680
Feng Wu was frightened

60
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,560
and you fell ill.

61
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,520
I'm really sorry about it.

62
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,920
I bought you these things.

63
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,920
I hope you'll like them.

64
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,880
I've asked you not to mention it again.

65
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,600
I'll accept your apology.

66
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,200
The gifts are not necessary.

67
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:09,720
Take them back.

68
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:11,200
How could I do that?

69
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,680
If you don't accept them,

70
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,440
it'll mean that you don't want to forgive me.

71
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:17,320
I'll still be tied in knots

72
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,920
and can't rest easy.

73
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,040
Besides,

74
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,880
before my dad left, he specially told me

75
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,360
to take care of you and Feng Wu.

76
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,480
Although over the years,

77
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:30,080
the Feng family have treated you shabbily,

78
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:32,040
since my uncle passed away...

79
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,520
I asked you not to mention it again.

80
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:36,000
We're a family.
I won't be unforgiving of you.

81
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:36,960
Take the things

82
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,160
and leave now.

83
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:42,720
Aunt,

84
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,880
to be honest,

85
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,360
I've also come

86
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,920
to discuss something with you.

87
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:52,000
I found a good match

88
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,560
for Feng Wu.

89
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:57,080
He wants to marry Young Lady to someone.

90
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:00,920
Who's at the door?

91
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:28,640
Where's the pendant?

92
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,080
Did I left it at Feng's house?

93
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,760
Jun Linyuan,

94
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,640
how could you fly on your sword now?

95
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:58,640
What's the matter?

96
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:00,080
My Lady.

97
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:01,440
My Lady.

98
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,360
We're practicing using swords.

99
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,600
Don't get it wrong.

100
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,520
I don't want to
teach such a stupid person again.

101
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:10,320
You...

102
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,960
Ignore him, My Lady.

103
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,760
Come. Go home with me now.

104
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:19,920
Why?

105
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:22,120
Did something happen to my mom?

106
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:22,920
No. No.

107
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,600
Young Master wants to marry you to someone.

108
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:25,400
What?

109
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,200
Is he crazy?

110
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,400
Let's go now.

111
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:35,800
Get out!

112
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:50,440
Goddess Zuo.

113
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,600
Don't be so bad-tempered.

114
00:08:58,760 --> 00:08:59,720
Otherwise,

115
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,960
how could you wait on His Highness Jun?

116
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:04,560
Goddess Zuo,

117
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:05,840
what do you mean?

118
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,320
As long as you do things well,

119
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:09,160
you'll have plenty of chances.

120
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,640
I need to leave the Border City
for a period of time,

121
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:13,960
but there's one thing

122
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,400
troubling me.

123
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,480
I wonder

124
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,080
if you can help me.

125
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:21,640
Just tell me. I will do my best.

126
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:25,200
His Highness Jun
came to look for the Celestial Fruit.

127
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:26,680
Now,

128
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:28,120
he has made no progress.

129
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,960
Help him out for me

130
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,120
and meet his needs.

131
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,720
Don't always make life difficult for people.

132
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,680
I see. Don't worry.

133
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,200
I will do my best to help His Highness

134
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,360
and report everything to you.

135
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,920
Go and help me tell His Highness Jun.

136
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,280
I'm leaving.

137
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:44,560
I'll see you in the capital.

138
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,640
Goodbye, Goddess Zuo.

139
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,000
The Celestial Fruit

140
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,840
is less important
than being His Highness Jun's wife.

141
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,560
Feng Wu,

142
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,640
you've really been a hindrance.

143
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:06,440
Cousin, cousin.

144
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:07,400
Cousin.

145
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:08,440
Cousin!

146
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,360
Feng Yiran,

147
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:11,880
listen carefully.

148
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,160
It's not up to you to decide who I'll marry.

149
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:15,280
Cousin,

150
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,680
I know I made a lot of mistakes before.

151
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:20,120
I have my troubles.

152
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,400
But it's really a good chance.

153
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,320
Consider it again, okay?

154
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:25,880
If you have troubles,

155
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:28,760
everyone will have troubles
in the whole world.

156
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:30,760
Cousin.

157
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:31,440
Let go.

158
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:34,280
Let go of me!

159
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:36,960
I'm the rightful heir

160
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,360
of the Feng family now.

161
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,400
If you dare to make any decisions for me,

162
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:41,200
do you believe I'll...

163
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,240
What will you do?

164
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:47,840
What are you doing here?

165
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:49,880
Brother,

166
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,560
can't you see she doesn't wanna talk to you?

167
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,280
How could you be so servile to her?

168
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,800
You've really shamed the Feng family!

169
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,600
Feng Liu, don't make more trouble for me.

170
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:02,680
You,

171
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:03,880
step aside.

172
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:06,320
I will battle with her.

173
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:09,560
Feng Wu,

174
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:12,600
I doubt that
you're the heir of the Feng family.

175
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,200
According to rules of the family,

176
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,400
let's fight.

177
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:16,920
If you win,

178
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,400
I'll go back to the capital

179
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,760
and never come to the Border City again.

180
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,640
What if I lose?

181
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,040
You'll give me the Phoenix Sword.

182
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,920
Your Highness Jun, you're quite busy.

183
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:37,800
It's you again.

184
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:39,320
Yes, it's me.

185
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:40,880
Fight me.

186
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,360
I'm not fighting you.

187
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:48,200
I've been tired of it.

188
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,240
It's so boring.

189
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,280
Why are you having it?

190
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:54,680
Do you want it?

191
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,120
I can give it to you

192
00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:00,080
but you have to tell me
what your relationship with Feng Wu is.

193
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,000
I'm not telling you.

194
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:21,720
Feng Wu.

195
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:23,480
Feng Liu, what do you want to do now?

196
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:24,720
You're not competing with me

197
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,000
but trying to kill me!

198
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,160
Exactly.

199
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,360
This is the Feng family's business.

200
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:39,400
We're obeying our own rules.

201
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,360
If you meddle in it,

202
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,560
you'll make an enemy of us.

203
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:46,040
Our status is not as high as yours

204
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,040
but we're still a noble family.

205
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:49,360
I hope

206
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,040
you'll think it over.

207
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:02,320
Feng Yiran, how could you
turn on a sixpence so quickly?

208
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:06,560
Take it easy.

209
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:08,760
It's their own business.

210
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,200
He's right. We shouldn't interfere.

211
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:11,680
Let's just watch now.

212
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,240
If she runs into danger,

213
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:14,840
we'll go to her rescue.

214
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:24,880
Say it.

215
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,160
What on earth
is your relationship with Feng Wu?

216
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:30,240
Give my pendant
and Feng Xiaowu back to me first.

217
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:31,800
Feng Xiaowu?

218
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:34,680
Who told you I took Feng Xiaowu away?

219
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,160
Is it Feng Wu?

220
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:38,040
How do you know?

221
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:41,240
Otherwise, why did I keep following you?

222
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,760
People like you are the most detestable.

223
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,000
You're a hypocrite

224
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,520
who always bullies girls.

225
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:49,800
I guessed right.

226
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:05,600
Hey,

227
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:06,560
where are you going?

228
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:07,600
Aren't you gonna keep fighting with me?

229
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:09,880
You fool,

230
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:11,640
you've been cheated twice.

231
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:12,920
Can't you learn a lesson?

232
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:15,440
What are you talking about?
Who cheated me twice?

233
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:20,040
Doesn't this trick of lying to both sides

234
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,640
look familiar to you?

235
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,600
My home is near the border.

236
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,760
I was taken to the Frozen Forest

237
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,360
by Jun Linyuan suddenly.

238
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,120
I'm willing to

239
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:42,840
mix myself inside them

240
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,560
to seize the Celestial Fruit for you

241
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:45,800
to repay your kindness.

242
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:46,880
She's just

243
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,480
an ugly girl who stole the Celestial Fruit.

244
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:50,160
Do you have to be hung up on her?

245
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:51,640
Don't talk about her like that.

246
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:53,640
I hear

247
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:55,720
Jun Linyuan has caught Feng Xiaowu.

248
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:57,320
And

249
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:59,280
he's trying to find out
where the Celestial Fruit is.

250
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,200
If you want to save her,

251
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:02,720
just follow Jun Linyuan.

252
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:06,160
Have we met somewhere?

253
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,280
Feng Wu is Feng Xiaowu.

254
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:12,640
Little Fairy!

255
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:15,400
Hey,

256
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,360
you've broken off your engagement.

257
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:19,560
From now on,

258
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,720
whether she's Feng Wu or Feng Xiaowu,

259
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,360
she'll be mine.

260
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:42,800
-My Lady.
-Feng Wu!

261
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:44,400
Family business.

262
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:45,600
Family business.

263
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:56,000
Go to hell!

264
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:09,480
Feng Wu,

265
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:10,600
don't be afraid.

266
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:50,080
Just a nobody.

267
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,960
How dare you hurt me?

268
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:10,520
-Feng Wu!
-Feng Wu!

269
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,120
Mu Jiuzhou.

270
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,240
What did you say?

271
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:50,520
Feng Wu is Feng Xiaowu?

272
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,160
Boss Jun,

273
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:53,520
are you mistaken?

274
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:54,640
I'm sure about it.

275
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,320
She fooled us and Yu Mingye.

276
00:17:58,120 --> 00:17:59,400
After seeing what just happened,

277
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,120
I'm pretty sure

278
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:03,680
this girl is still
keeping something else from us.

279
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:06,160
But how do we explain

280
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,480
what happened just now?

281
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,240
She was like...

282
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,000
like...

283
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,040
Like someone else.

284
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,480
Yes, that's what it felt like.

285
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:17,760
When she's awake,

286
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,320
we must ask her to make it clear.

287
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:34,200
Luckily, I was quick-witted
and went once I woke up.

288
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:35,240
Otherwise,

289
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:36,960
I would have been held up.

290
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:41,840
Open it.

291
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:47,640
Nine Transformation Spirit Restoration Pill.

292
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:48,760
I did it.

293
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:51,440
Take it.

294
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:59,200
What's this smell?

295
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,760
Good medicine tastes bitter.

296
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,120
Don't spit it out.

297
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:17,240
Someone's coming.

298
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:18,240
Who's that?

299
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,360
What... what's he doing here?

300
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:28,000
I...

301
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:29,480
Hey, where should I hide?

302
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:30,840
Where should you hide?

303
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:33,360
I can't throw you into the furnace, can I?

304
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,040
Oh dear,

305
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:35,680
oh dear,

306
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:37,040
what should I do?

307
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,680
Did you come to catch me?

308
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:43,400
I came to take you away,

309
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:44,400
Little Fairy.

310
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:46,080
Or should I call you

311
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,520
Feng Xiaowu?

312
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,440
You're here for the Celestial Fruit,
aren't you?

313
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:51,240
I've eaten it.

314
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:52,920
It's useless

315
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,040
even if you kill me.

316
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:02,440
You cheated me twice.

317
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:03,880
I've been looking for you.

318
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:05,200
Answer me.

319
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:06,520
How should you make amends to me?

320
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:07,440
I...

321
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:09,000
I don't know what you're talking about.

322
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,720
Why should I make amends?

323
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,400
I told you the person I liked

324
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,120
was Little Fairy.

325
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,600
So...

326
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:24,480
Cut the crap.

327
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:26,440
He's at the door already.

328
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:33,760
-What's wrong?
-Shut up.

329
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:36,120
What are you doing?

330
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:37,560
Are you alone here?

331
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:39,080
What's up?

332
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,120
I'm also here.

333
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:44,520
Yes,

334
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,040
I'm Feng Xiaowu.

335
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,840
I've eaten the Celestial Fruit.

336
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:48,960
What can you do?

337
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:00,680
I'm glad you admitted it.

338
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:02,960
Aren't you angry?

339
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,920
I've long suspected you're Feng Xiaowu.

340
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:08,320
Now I can't recover the Celestial Fruit.

341
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:10,680
I just want to know

342
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,160
what your relationship
with Darknight Court is.

343
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:17,800
Why would I have anything to do with that?

344
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,240
That's hard to tell.

345
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,360
Why are you here?

346
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:30,240
You were looking for someone. So was I.

347
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,440
You really colluded with Yu Mingye.

348
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:36,920
I...

349
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:39,280
That was a hateful thing to say.

350
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:42,520
I want to collude with Little Fairy

351
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,600
but she won't give me a chance,

352
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:46,200
right?

353
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:21,160
Oh dear,

354
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,600
I can never make myself clear.

355
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:31,720
Why can't I summon the Phoenix Sword?

356
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:33,680
Haven't I recovered my spirit energy?

357
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,560
My stupid girl,

358
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:38,520
you've got to let the medicine digest.

359
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:49,440
Shame on you trying to hurt a girl.

360
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:51,400
I'll take Feng Wu away.

361
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:10,800
Won't you be courting death
if you go back now?

362
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:11,760
Why don't you come with me?

363
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:13,240
Why should I come with you?

364
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:15,360
I need to stay away from Darknight Court.

365
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:16,840
Isn't it nice to join us?

366
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:17,800
Few people can compare

367
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,400
with me on Qianyuan Continent.

368
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,200
I've got something to do.

369
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:24,080
What is it?

370
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:29,520
Hit him. Hit him. Hit him.

371
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,280
Hey, what are you doing?

372
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,560
How could you bully him?

373
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:33,680
It's none of your business.

374
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:35,200
You...

375
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,320
Put me down. Put me down.

376
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,000
-Put me down.
-Yu Mingye,

377
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,160
put him down now.

378
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:44,400
Put me down.

379
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:54,240
Little boy,

380
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:55,120
are you okay?

381
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:56,800
Are you hurt?

382
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,320
Don't cry. Don't cry.

383
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:02,080
Hey,

384
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:03,840
you're a man. Stop crying.

385
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:04,680
Aren't you ashamed?

386
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,720
Now you know the importance of power,
don't you?

387
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:12,760
You won't be bullied
only when you're strong enough.

388
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
You're in a place
where the strong prey on the weak.

389
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:17,520
We need to be stronger

390
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:18,240
just to

391
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,360
create and protect things we cherish most.

392
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:22,200
If violence is met with violence,

393
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:23,760
we'll be the same

394
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:24,880
as people we hate,

395
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:25,680
isn't it?

396
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:42,680
Kill him.

397
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:46,040
You are the qualified heir
of Darknight Court.

398
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:48,320
But he's Xiaokong,

399
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:51,400
the person I grew up with!

400
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:53,640
Are you hurt?

401
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:00,520
Alright, go home now.

402
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:01,560
Thank you.

403
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:10,840
Why are you staring at me?

404
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:12,520
Is there something on my face?

405
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,840
You always say nice things.

406
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:19,960
If only I had met you earlier.

407
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:25,440
I need to go. Don't follow me.

408
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:26,160
See you around.

409
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:27,360
It was hard for me to get you out of there.

410
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:28,680
Are you abandoning me like this?

411
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:31,200
I'm sorry that I cheated you before.

412
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:33,080
Thanks for what you did today.

413
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:33,960
I'll repay you later.

414
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,200
Be seeing you.

415
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:32,120
Master.

416
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:37,280
Master.

417
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:38,360
Master.

418
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:43,680
It's useless.

419
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,480
But when I was in danger,

420
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:48,000
I felt he was there.

421
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:48,960
Why is that?

422
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:51,880
Your Master is in deep sleep

423
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:52,880
but in his subconscious,

424
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,840
he can still know whether you're safe.

425
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:56,080
When you were in danger,

426
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:58,240
he wanted to protect you and helped you.

427
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:00,840
But I'm afraid he can't expend

428
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:03,520
his spirit energy like this again.

429
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:06,320
Master.

430
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:09,160
Alright, don't be mushy.

431
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,400
Thanks to him,

432
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:13,280
you've smoothly taken
Nine Transformation Spirit Restoration Pill.

433
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:16,720
I just opened up your spirit vessels.

434
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:19,280
You're a
junior-rank spiritual practitioner now.

435
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:31,120
Great.

436
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:33,280
Then I don't have to

437
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:34,400
carry a torch in the forest anymore.

438
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:35,560
Of course.

439
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:37,120
If your Master wakes up

440
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,040
and sees you
using the Phoenix Sword like that,

441
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:41,920
I don't know whether he'll be happy or sad.

442
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:55,840
What's wrong?

443
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:57,560
Why do I

444
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:59,280
suddenly feel a bit tired?

445
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,840
You just became
a junior-rank spiritual practitioner.

446
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:04,720
The spirit energy you can use
in a day is limited.

447
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:05,600
That's to say,

448
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:07,600
as long as I become a
medium-rank spiritual practitioner,

449
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:08,880
a senior-rank one

450
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,120
or even a Great Spiritual Master,

451
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:13,440
I won't just be able to make a tiny flame?

452
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:14,840
It may be a fireball,

453
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:17,640
a big fire or even a huge one?

454
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:20,480
You can consider it that way.

455
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:22,560
Awesome.

456
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:23,840
In that case,

457
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:25,520
I won't have to collect sticks

458
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:27,040
to roast fish anymore.

459
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:29,480
I'm sure that if your Master wakes up

460
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:31,040
and sees you abusing
your spirit energy like that,

461
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:33,240
he'll get so angry
and fall into another deep sleep.

462
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:35,480
I was just kidding.

463
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:51,920
Where's Feng Wu?

464
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:53,320
What has that

465
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:54,520
got to do with you?

466
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:58,840
I asked you where she was.

467
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:27,080
Let go.

468
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:29,840
Hey,

469
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:31,040
are you going

470
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:33,000
to die with me here?

471
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:34,720
You let go first.

472
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:36,440
Why should I?

473
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,320
Last time,

474
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:38,360
who was so wicked

475
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:39,800
and made me take a pill?

476
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,120
You let go first.

477
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:43,400
Then firstly tell me

478
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:44,680
where Feng Wu is.

479
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:50,640
She has gone home.

480
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:51,760
Really?

481
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:57,160
Really?

482
00:29:59,400 --> 00:29:59,960
Okay.

483
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:01,560
I'll count to three.

484
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,680
Let's let go together.

485
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:05,240
-One,
-Okay.

486
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:07,000
two,

487
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:08,360
three.

488
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:25,640
I haven't fought with someone

489
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:27,680
to my heart's content for a long time.

490
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,920
It's the first time
I've seen you being like that.

491
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:35,360
You like her very much,

492
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:36,480
don't you?

493
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,000
It's none of your business.

494
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:44,160
Of course it's my business.

495
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:48,680
I don't care about your engagement.

496
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,000
You can't say that you like Feng Wu

497
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:52,200
but I can.

498
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:55,400
If you keep being vague about it,

499
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:58,160
be careful or I'll steal her from you.

500
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:08,240
Now that you haven't told anyone,

501
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,880
everyone's aware that
you're not gonna marry her.

502
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:12,200
In other words,

503
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:14,840
you have no right to
meddle in Feng Wu's affairs.

504
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:16,920
Just wait and see.

505
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:18,640
I will win her affections.

506
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,000
Aunt,

507
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:37,840
Feng Wu is really in trouble this time.

508
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:38,920
How do you think

509
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:41,040
she should take responsibility for it?

510
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:45,840
Boss Jun has forgiven her.

511
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:47,960
How could he do that?

512
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:50,840
His Highness Jun should punish her.

513
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:53,240
When Boss Jun knew Feng Wu was Feng Xiaowu,

514
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:54,600
this matter was

515
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:56,360
destined to end like this.

516
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:58,480
You shouldn't have brought it up.

517
00:31:59,000 --> 00:31:59,680
Right.

518
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:01,200
According to the engagement,

519
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:03,680
Feng Wu will be
Boss Jun's wife in the future.

520
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:06,160
They'll settle it themselves.

521
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:07,840
It's none of your business.

522
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:09,600
Nothing has been decided yet.

523
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:11,960
Isn't it too early to say that now?

524
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:13,600
Every debt has its debtor.

525
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:14,840
You couldn't find Feng Wu

526
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:16,520
and came to trouble her mother.

527
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:17,880
It's inappropriate, isn't it?

528
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:20,160
It's the Feng family's business

529
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:22,400
and you interfered in it.

530
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,360
Aren't you afraid
we'll tell the Holy Sovereign?

531
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:25,640
Feel free to do that.

532
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:27,120
I don't believe

533
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:29,560
His Majesty will allow you

534
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:32,200
to hurt a civilian without any spirit energy.

535
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:33,240
You...

536
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:39,440
His Highness Jun wanted the Celestial Fruit.

537
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:40,320
How could she be forgiven?

538
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:42,720
I'm only looking out for His Highness Jun.

539
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:44,160
Don't make an excuse of me.

540
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:45,440
Your Highness.

541
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:50,080
This matter has been over.

542
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:51,440
There's no need to talk about it.

543
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:53,000
What did you say?

544
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:54,240
Boss Jun asked you

545
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:58,200
to leave it at that!

546
00:32:58,600 --> 00:32:59,000
I...

547
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:05,320
Your Highness Jun,

548
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:06,760
you're hurt.

549
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:09,480
It's okay. I just bumped into something.

550
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:11,480
Where's Feng Wu?

551
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:13,320
She

552
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:15,040
should be on the way back.

553
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:16,120
Don't worry.

554
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:21,320
Feng Wu has caused you
so much trouble recently.

555
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:23,880
Thank you for being forgiving

556
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:25,160
and letting her off.

557
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:28,400
But we still have to make it up to you.

558
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:30,760
What can we do for you?

559
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:31,680
Madame,

560
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:32,720
that's not necessary.

561
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:34,080
Your Highness,

562
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:35,720
as long as you say it,

563
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,440
I will persuade Feng Wu

564
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:38,680
to complete it

565
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,160
and do it properly.

566
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:42,880
Okay.

567
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,040
Just ask Feng Wu

568
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:46,840
to do me a favor.

569
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:58,640
Who is it?

570
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:02,360
Young Master.

571
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:04,320
What's up?

572
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:07,900
There's a letter from the Lord of Devils.

573
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:08,340
(For Yu Mingye's eyes only)

574
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:10,400
I can guess what it says.

575
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:12,760
I've made a mistake this time.

576
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:15,840
I'm sorry, Young Master.

577
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:18,150
Lord Demon told me to write back on time.

578
00:34:18,670 --> 00:34:19,320
Fine.

579
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:21,080
Read the letter.

580
00:34:21,630 --> 00:34:22,190
Yes.

581
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:30,320
Jun Linyuan failed to
find the Celestial Fruit

582
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:32,150
and upset the Holy Sovereign.

583
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:34,150
I'm afraid we'll also get the blame.

584
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:35,600
Even though we can shift it,

585
00:34:35,630 --> 00:34:37,000
Jun Linyuan will have another plan.

586
00:34:37,190 --> 00:34:38,120
Things have happened.

587
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:39,840
It's useless to stay in the Border City.

588
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,280
Come back now and do some other work.

589
00:34:42,710 --> 00:34:44,880
Lord Demon is always so well-informed

590
00:34:45,190 --> 00:34:46,920
and he's so sure
Jun Linyuan will have another plan.

591
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:54,840
Answer me.

592
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:55,710
Yes, Young Master.

593
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:57,000
Does Lord Demon

594
00:34:57,230 --> 00:34:59,150
have secret contact

595
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:01,000
with someone in Jun Wu clan?

596
00:35:02,670 --> 00:35:03,400
This person

597
00:35:03,630 --> 00:35:05,400
must be influential.

598
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:06,880
Who will it be?

599
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:07,840
Young Master,

600
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:09,240
when the time comes,

601
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:12,240
Lord Demon will tell you in person.

602
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:13,960
Alright,

603
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:16,520
I'll just obey.

604
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:19,040
When Jun Wu clan falls,

605
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:22,960
Darknight Court
will take over this continent again.

606
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:27,360
Can I have one? Can I have one?

607
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:30,080
Don't grab. Can I have one?

608
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:31,600
-I want one.
-Me, too. Me, too.

609
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:32,160
Can I have one?

610
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:33,400
-Don't worry.
-Can I have one?

611
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:34,560
Thanks. Thanks.

612
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,240
We're collecting wishes
for the Holy Sovereign's birthday.

613
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:37,240
It won't take too long.

614
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:39,320
Write him a message
and send your best wishes.

615
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:41,640
Queue up, everyone.

616
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:43,200
You'll all have one.

617
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:44,640
Don't squeeze. Don't squeeze.

618
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:46,680
Here you go. Here.

619
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:50,360
Thanks. Thanks.

620
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:54,720
Can I have one? I want one, too.

621
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:56,360
Don't be so servile. Go away.

622
00:35:58,120 --> 00:35:58,520
Well...

623
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:01,520
Can I have one? I want it, too.

624
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:02,360
Take this.

625
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:04,160
How could such a fierce girl

626
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:05,920
be Fifth Young Lady's relative?

627
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:07,440
She's not a patch on her.

628
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:10,320
I'm done.

629
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:14,600
Can I have one? Can I have one?

630
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:15,960
Thanks. Thanks.

631
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:19,040
I wanna write something, too.

632
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:22,400
Your Highness Jun, Your Highness Jun,

633
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:24,560
can I have one? I want it, too.

634
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:25,560
Your Highness.

635
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:26,960
Your Highness Jun.

636
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:28,680
Your Highness,

637
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:30,480
Feng Wu has gone to town

638
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,280
to bring more people here.

639
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:34,560
This present is not expensive

640
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:36,200
but it's loaded with good wishes.

641
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:38,560
His Majesty is a kind-hearted man.

642
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:40,360
He'll definitely like it.

643
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:43,800
It's indeed a good idea
to collect people's wishes.

644
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:45,680
Without the Celestial Fruit,

645
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,720
I was wondering what to do.

646
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:51,520
It's Feng Wu's idea.

647
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:54,720
Thank you for your cooperation.

648
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:56,540
(Your Majesty will live
as long as the sun and the moon.)

649
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:57,240
What did you write?

650
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:58,640
What did you write?

651
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:00,400
What do you think of this?

652
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:01,780
Let me see.

653
00:37:01,780 --> 00:37:03,260
(Wish the country prosperity.)

654
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,360
It's a good one.

655
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:05,300
(Wish the country prosperity
and Your Majesty longevity.)

656
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:08,280
His Majesty will be glad to see it.

657
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:15,960
Don't worry. You'll all have one.

658
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:17,760
Don't worry.

659
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:19,320
Madam, I'm finished.

660
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:22,680
Don't worry. Here you go.

661
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:25,240
Let me help you, sir.

662
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:26,480
Thanks, then.

663
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:27,080
Okay.

664
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:29,760
Boss Jun.

665
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:31,000
Can I have another one?

666
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:33,520
Just now that person said

667
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:35,400
he'd go to other places
and tell people about it.

668
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:37,440
In that case, we'll finish collecting

669
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:39,440
people's wishes within a few days.

670
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:40,680
And I've really

671
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:42,560
got to hand it to Feng Wu.

672
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:44,600
She came up with such a good idea.

673
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:46,760
It's all because of My Lady's

674
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:48,080
good reputation in the Border City.

675
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:49,000
People are

676
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,600
willing to do this for her sake.

677
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:56,560
Boss Jun,

678
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:59,360
everyone likes you so much.

679
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:00,680
Give out some, too.

680
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:02,720
I seldom smile.

681
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:05,640
Yeah, you're always cold.

682
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:09,680
Why are you as bad as Feng Wu now?

683
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:11,640
How... how come we're bad?

684
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:13,440
I'm obviously as good as Feng Wu.

685
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:14,760
Don't you

686
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:16,680
like this?

687
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:24,320
Boss Jun,

688
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:27,320
is it because of the Loveless Insect Venom?

689
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:28,800
No.

690
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:32,320
Is it because

691
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:34,400
as long as I mention Feng Wu,

692
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,320
the Loveless Insect Venom will trouble you?

693
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:38,720
Feng Wu.

694
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:39,880
Feng Wu.

695
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:41,000
You'll go back to the capital yourself

696
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:43,080
if you say one more word.

697
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:48,520
We're collecting birthday wishes.

698
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:49,400
Take one.

699
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:51,080
-Take one.
-Okay.

700
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:52,040
We're collecting birthday wishes.

701
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:57,200
We're collecting wishes
for the Holy Sovereign's birthday.

702
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:58,000
Take one.

703
00:38:58,760 --> 00:38:59,800
Take it.

704
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:00,920
Take one.

705
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:02,040
Can I have one?

706
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:02,920
-Here you go.
-Thanks.

707
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:04,280
I want one.

708
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:05,720
Me, too. Me, too.

709
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:06,840
-And me.
-Can I have one?

710
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:08,080
Here you go.

711
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:09,000
Here, here.

712
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:10,360
Thanks.

713
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:11,960
Can I have one?

714
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:13,080
Have you finished writing?

715
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:14,000
Put it in if you do.

716
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:15,040
Here you go.

717
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:16,480
Here.

718
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:18,720
Can I have one?

719
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:32,200
Fantastic.

720
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:40,480
Let them go.

721
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:15,320
Your Highness Jun,

722
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:17,600
I still want to apologize

723
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:20,000
to you for the Celestial Fruit.

724
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:22,880
Now you know you should apologize?

725
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:25,480
I have to do it.

726
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:28,080
I know you're an angel

727
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:30,120
who has forgiven me for stealing it.

728
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,360
I'm not worrying now.

729
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:34,560
I'm really grateful

730
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:36,600
for your kindness.

731
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:40,320
I'll be glad as long as
you stay away from Yu Mingye.

732
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:54,640
Why didn't you report it to me earlier?

733
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:56,480
That kind of pigeons are often seen

734
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:58,320
so I didn't think much.

735
00:41:58,640 --> 00:41:59,320
What a moron!

736
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:00,800
I've been negligent.

737
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:01,640
Aunt,

738
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:02,920
please don't be angry.

739
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:10,960
Your Majesty.

740
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:14,000
Has the Holy Sovereign gone to bed?

741
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:15,840
He hasn't, Your Majesty.

742
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:17,840
He's reading messages inside.

743
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:24,160
Wait outside.

744
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:26,240
Yes.

745
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:31,120
What is it?

746
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:33,800
You're so happy today.

747
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:36,000
I've really got a good son.

748
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:38,880
He gave me such a surprise.

749
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:40,480
Look at this.

750
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:43,880
It says

751
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:45,160
I bring people happiness

752
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:46,520
and peace

753
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:49,160
and I can definitely
be an immortal in the future.

754
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:52,000
And this.

755
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:57,040
It says I'm a good king
that's on a par with Liu Bei.

756
00:42:58,020 --> 00:43:00,540
(Your Majesty is a good king
that's on a par with Liu Bei.)

757
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:02,040
Who's Liu Bei?

758
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:04,680
Have you heard about him?
