2
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:40,580
(Episode 6)

3
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:43,320
Your Highness Jun,

4
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:44,800
this is what happened.

5
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,880
Someone in the city has seen
the person in the picture

6
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:50,040
visiting an Elixir Refiner's place.

7
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:51,440
Elixir Refiner?

8
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,280
Old Man Ba?

9
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:54,400
That's right.

10
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,240
Your Highness Jun is indeed insightful!

11
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:58,600
Oh, no! No!

12
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,840
We are screwed!

13
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:03,240
Looks like we were too careless yesterday.

14
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,520
He actually fooled us!

15
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:06,920
Alright, Lord Bi,

16
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,040
we'll investigate on our own next.

17
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,680
We'll let you know if we need more help.

18
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:12,080
Okay.

19
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:12,920
By the way,

20
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:13,760
Your Highness Jun,

21
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,320
you will stay in the Border City
a little longer, right?

22
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:18,880
I've asked people
to thoroughly clean up my place.

23
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,640
If you don't mind,

24
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,640
you can move to my house.

25
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:23,560
No need.

26
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,200
Your Highness Jun,

27
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,200
we need to...

28
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,120
Let's get ready to set out.

29
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,720
Take care, Your Highness!

30
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,800
Goddess Zuo, please leave

31
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,240
without me.

32
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,240
Zhao Ge,

33
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,120
we haven't seen each other for long.

34
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,920
You've become so distant.

35
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,600
You just called me

36
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:58,880
Goddess Zuo.

37
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,320
I don't belong
to the Celestial Palace anymore.

38
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,600
Why didn't you stay in the capital?

39
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,760
What are you doing here in Jingzhou?

40
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:08,680
I heard that a demonic beast
showed up in Jingzhou.

41
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:12,000
I didn't have things
to do in the capital anyway,

42
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,160
so...

43
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,600
That makes sense.

44
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,120
Your cultivation base is still weak.

45
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:19,240
Even if you stayed in the capital
and cultivated every day,

46
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,880
it still wouldn't help much.

47
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,080
So it's better to enjoy your life

48
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,120
and have some fun.

49
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,240
Zhao Ge.

50
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,280
Don't travel around alone.

51
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,800
Your spirit energy is not strong
enough to protect yourself.

52
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,760
What would you do if you really encountered

53
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:36,760
that demonic beast?

54
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,360
Do you

55
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:41,800
need me to go to the Master and...

56
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:42,800
No.

57
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,600
I heard you.

58
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,400
I will return to the capital.

59
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:50,560
Miss, enjoy.

60
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,320
Have something to eat first.

61
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:10,200
Zhao Ge.

62
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,720
You may as well eat a bit less.

63
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:15,600
Though there is a cure to detoxify you,

64
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:17,920
for now...

65
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:35,960
Zhao Ge,

66
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:36,920
go ahead.

67
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,960
Mu Yao and I have something to deal with.

68
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,160
Wait for me.

69
00:04:55,780 --> 00:05:02,500
(Changes are going on in the capital.
His Majesty is unwell. Please return promptly.)

70
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,000
Boss Jun, was that a letter from the capital?

71
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,440
We need to hurry up.

72
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:17,880
Xuan Yi.

73
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:19,280
Hit the road now.

74
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,480
You'll be in charge of it.

75
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:21,480
Yes.

76
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,040
Zhao Ge went back to the capital.

77
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,360
Let's go to the border

78
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,640
and meet Feng Wu!

79
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:58,360
Sister! It's a critical time now!

80
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,080
The Phoenix Sword is nowhere to be found.

81
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,760
And we don't know
what's on His Highness Jun's mind.

82
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,720
Will you figure out a solution for me?

83
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,280
Brother,

84
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:10,120
I don't know what you are worried about.

85
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:13,800
I think everything's going just well.

86
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:14,800
How so?

87
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,640
Think about it.

88
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,440
His Highness Jun prefers staying
in this old shabby mansion

89
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:22,840
rather than moving to a nice house.

90
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,280
Whom is he doing this for?

91
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:25,880
Feng Wu?

92
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,320
Are you kidding?

93
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:29,920
Everybody can see that he's doing it for me!

94
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:35,080
Besides, Feng Wu is such a loser now.

95
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,880
She has no chance at all!

96
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,880
So,

97
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,560
I'm the one that His Highness Jun is...

98
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,520
Then why did he take Feng Wu out

99
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,560
instead of you?

100
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:48,000
Because... Because Feng Wu
is familiar with the border.

101
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,000
Moreover, leading the way is a servant's job.

102
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:54,640
His Highness Jun wouldn't let me do that.

103
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,480
Even so,

104
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,680
where's the Phoenix Sword?

105
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,280
Are you a fool?

106
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,480
This old mansion is not that big.

107
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,760
Just be patient

108
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:04,560
and find more help

109
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:06,600
to search all the corners,

110
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,400
even underground.

111
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,840
You'll find it sooner or later!

112
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,160
You are right, sister!

113
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,520
I'll do that!

114
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,360
Hope we'll both

115
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:19,400
make our dreams come true on this trip!

116
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,080
Brother!

117
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,040
Sister!

118
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,000
Old man.

119
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,040
With your age,

120
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:37,120
you should know clearly

121
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,400
whom you can mess with

122
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,560
and whom you cannot!

123
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,600
Where's Feng Xiaowu?

124
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:55,880
Say it!

125
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,040
Otherwise...

126
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,240
Boss Jun.

127
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,840
What are they doing here?

128
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,680
Hello? Anybody here?

129
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:36,840
Anybody here?

130
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,240
Anyone?

131
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,400
Boss Jun,

132
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,080
it's empty.

133
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,120
Someone just refined elixir here
not long ago.

134
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,440
It must be that lass! She took away
the elixir and the refiner!

135
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,040
Let's go get her!

136
00:08:59,160 --> 00:08:59,840
Don't bother.

137
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,360
It's not Feng Xiaowu.

138
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,800
How... How do you know?

139
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,760
This person has high-level spirit energy;

140
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,240
There's no sign of a fight in this room;

141
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,640
Everything was fine on our way here,

142
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,680
which means...

143
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:19,920
Means what?

144
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:41,600
Come out, now!

145
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:47,320
Jun Linyuan, you are not that dumb!

146
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,200
-Stop fighting! Stop fighting!
-Old Man Ba!

147
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,400
Help!

148
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,360
Are you alright?

149
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:56,720
Miss!

150
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Yu Mingye! It's you again!

151
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,680
You are everywhere

152
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:04,840
and always make trouble!

153
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,560
I'll teach you a lesson today!

154
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,680
You always gang up on me!

155
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,200
So pathetic!

156
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:28,880
This scent!

157
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:32,280
Have we met before?

158
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:35,240
No way!

159
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,080
I'll strike if you don't let her go!

160
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:47,640
Don't go after him!

161
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:51,120
It's more important
to find the Celestial Fruit.

162
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:57,920
Come and take a look!

163
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:05,200
Don't know what His Highness Jun likes.

164
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:10,440
Who is it?

165
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:23,920
"Up to the celestial clouds
and down to the netherworld."

166
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:26,960
The Celestial Palace?

167
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,080
Old man, this is her.

168
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:40,160
Let me take a close look!

169
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:50,000
Do you remember this person at all?

170
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,560
Have I met her

171
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,800
or not?

172
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:57,360
Yes or no?

173
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,080
We have a witness.

174
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,360
So please tell us the truth.

175
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:04,760
Then, I think I have.

176
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:07,000
So please tell us everything.

177
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:10,120
Since I admitted I've met her,

178
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,480
let me look closely

179
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:16,000
in case I made a mistake.

180
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:21,960
I remember now.

181
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:26,160
This Feng Xiaowu

182
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,720
is such a poor girl!

183
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,240
She stole our stuff.

184
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,840
Why do you pity her?

185
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,920
It's quite a story.

186
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:38,000
Here's what happened.

187
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:40,560
This Feng Xiaowu

188
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,160
has a brother

189
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:45,160
named Wu Song.

190
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:47,560
Hold on.

191
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,760
How come the last name

192
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:51,840
of Feng Xiaowu's brother is Wu?

193
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,800
It's just the way it is

194
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,080
that the last name

195
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:57,560
of Feng Xiaowu's brother is Wu.

196
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:00,120
Speaking of Wu Song,

197
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:02,040
here's what happened.

198
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,680
Originally, he...

199
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:17,680
You scared me!

200
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:21,520
Only an inexperienced cultivator like you
would be scared.

201
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,480
Pay your respect, now!

202
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:26,720
Greetings to you, Goddess Zuo!

203
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:39,800
Goddess Zuo.

204
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:41,920
I thought you were in Jingzhou
to kill the Hundred Poison Beast.

205
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,520
When did you come to the border?

206
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,360
How come you didn't tell me in advance?

207
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:48,760
Why would Goddess Zuo

208
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,160
tell you about where she's going?

209
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,200
I didn't mean that!

210
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:52,600
I just wanted

211
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:54,200
to welcome you two.

212
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,960
I'm afraid we came at a bad time.

213
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:57,960
It's said that His Highness Jun

214
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,480
is living in your place!

215
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:00,800
That's not true!

216
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,160
He just stays there temporarily.

217
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:05,240
I don't even dare talk to him!

218
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:07,440
Of course!

219
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,440
He will ignore you anyway

220
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,360
if you talk to him!

221
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:13,400
Yes!

222
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,080
That's right!

223
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:30,080
Goddess Zuo, since you are here,

224
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,160
why don't you come with me
to see His Highness Jun?

225
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,800
He must be so happy

226
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:35,040
if he knows you are here!

227
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:36,520
Really?

228
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,160
Absolutely!

229
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,920
He talks about you quite often.

230
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:42,480
It's obvious

231
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,160
that how important you are to him.

232
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,080
I still have things to do.

233
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,840
It's not convenient for me to meet him.

234
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:50,600
While I'm away,

235
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:52,480
you should take good care
of His Highness Jun.

236
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:53,760
I certainly will!

237
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,880
I'll keep an eye on his whereabouts.

238
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:59,120
As a thoughtful noble lady from the capital,

239
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,240
you will be qualified to live

240
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:04,680
in the Junwu Divine Hall in the future.

241
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:06,720
Thank you in advance, Goddess Zuo!

242
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:07,920
I'll take my leave now.

243
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:18,280
Senior Sister!

244
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,160
Why did you let her go so easy?

245
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:24,160
It's quite obvious
that she has a thing for His Highness.

246
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:26,360
What if she betrays you?

247
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,400
Master is worried that Jun Linyuan

248
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:31,040
and Feng Wu will meet each other again.

249
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,800
Just let Feng Liu get in their way for now.

250
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:37,760
So far, His Highness Jun hasn't
made any progress in his investigation.

251
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:39,160
Let's wait a bit longer.

252
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,120
When he needs help,

253
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,480
I'll show up and give him a hand.

254
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,800
Senior Sister, you are indeed wise!

255
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:49,360
Feng Wu, it's been three years.

256
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:51,360
It's time for us to meet!

257
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:55,480
I see!

258
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:58,760
So, that bandit leader on Mount Liang

259
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:01,240
took away Feng Xiaowu

260
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,640
and the Celestial Fruit?

261
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:06,800
No!

262
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:07,960
Then what do you mean?

263
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,720
Here's the thing.

264
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:13,720
The one you just met is the Young Master
from Darknight Court.

265
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:14,880
And that Song Jiang

266
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:16,600
actually works for him!

267
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:18,440
I think

268
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:20,120
by now,

269
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,040
they've got Feng Xiaowu

270
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,000
and the Celestial Fruit.

271
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:26,520
What a shame!

272
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:27,240
Let's go.

273
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,160
Boss Jun, you aren't gonna ask more?

274
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:33,400
No need.

275
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,440
What... What's wrong?

276
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:59,000
Where's the Nine Transformation
Spirit Restoration Pill?

277
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:00,400
Don't worry.

278
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,480
I've got it stashed away!

279
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:05,440
Feng Wu, what's with the holdup?

280
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:06,280
Let's go!

281
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:07,480
Coming!

282
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:10,960
Good for you!

283
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:13,070
Thank God that you remember
the play I told you!

284
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,520
Of course, I do.

285
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:16,000
But, listen to me,

286
00:17:16,070 --> 00:17:16,590
you've messed with

287
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:19,200
some tough cultivators this time.

288
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:21,720
You'd better think about how to deal with it.

289
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,640
I don't care.

290
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:25,310
I've got to restore
my cultivation base first.

291
00:17:26,110 --> 00:17:27,110
I'm leaving!

292
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:29,350
Coming!

293
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,520
Boss Jun, why didn't you ask more?

294
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:41,320
Boss Jun,

295
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:42,440
what's wrong?

296
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:43,480
Are you okay?

297
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:44,520
You...

298
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,000
Why does he get chest pain all the time?

299
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,240
Looks like he's quite weak.

300
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,640
He's like a male version of Lin Daiyu.

301
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,840
Feng Wu, will your acupuncture therapy work?

302
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,520
Don't hurt him!

303
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,000
Don't worry.

304
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:25,000
My Lady is a well-known doctor.

305
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:26,920
She has helped a lot of people
to unblock their meridians,

306
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:29,360
as well as strengthened
their cultivation base.

307
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:30,520
That incredible?

308
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:37,640
Feng Wu, what's this?

309
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,320
It's a stone pestle I found here

310
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:41,720
to smash the herbs.

311
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:42,880
It's quite helpful.

312
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,240
There's strange Qi

313
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:08,840
flowing in the body of Boss Jun.

314
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:11,720
Do you know what's going on?

315
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:13,480
Maybe it's because

316
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:14,760
of the Loveless Insect Venom?

317
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:17,240
Loveless Insect Venom?

318
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,480
You tricked him to
take it when you were little.

319
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:21,800
It's been years,

320
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,440
but it's still in his body.

321
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,160
It doesn't sound like something I'd do!

322
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,320
I remember!

323
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,920
It's said that when it acts up,

324
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,880
Boss Jun will get an acute pain in his chest.

325
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,360
And he will say something against his will.

326
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:40,320
That's why!

327
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:43,080
No wonder he sometimes acts weirdly!

328
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:45,440
If he'd say something against his will,

329
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:48,280
then what he said back then...

330
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,040
Are you kidding?

331
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:52,280
You can kill her
or do whatever you like to her.

332
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,600
She isn't one of your people?

333
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:54,600
No.

334
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:56,920
She is just a passer-by.

335
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:58,600
She has nothing to do with me.

336
00:19:58,880 --> 00:19:59,640
Feng Wu.

337
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,800
Your acupuncture therapy is so magical!

338
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:02,840
Would you give me a treatment?

339
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:05,240
The therapy is not for fun.

340
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:06,480
I can't do it
when you don't have any symptoms.

341
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,160
Just give me a quick check!

342
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,560
You talk too much,

343
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:17,840
which consumes a lot of energy.

344
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,440
You should control yourself.

345
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:21,880
That's it?

346
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,400
Then what about Boss Jun?

347
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:27,880
He has

348
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:28,720
kidney deficiency.

349
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:29,920
Drinking more water will help.

350
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:33,680
Boss Jun, she said you have a kidney problem!

351
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:55,920
Who is it?

352
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,520
Come out!

353
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,360
Grandpa! It's me!

354
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,280
Xuan Yi!

355
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:12,760
Xuan Yi.

356
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,640
What are you doing here?

357
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,160
Is His Highness Jun okay?

358
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:19,520
Don't worry, grandpa.

359
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:21,040
He is fine!

360
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,760
So what

361
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,440
brought you here?

362
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,400
Jun Linyuan

363
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:42,080
is in such a poor heath

364
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:43,840
at such a young age!

365
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,240
The Loveless Insect Venom is so harmful!

366
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:52,120
But It's okay.

367
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:55,280
With my self-made Feng Wu
brand Rehmannia Pill,

368
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:56,280
he'll be fine!

369
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:58,840
Everybody will be fine!

370
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:10,200
Why did he flick three times

371
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,840
on my forehead?

372
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:31,840
Who...

373
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:33,840
Who are you?

374
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,200
How did you get in?

375
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:38,080
It's so easy for me

376
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:39,600
to get into a shabby house like this.

377
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:41,680
Thank God

378
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:44,280
that he doesn't recognize me!

379
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:48,080
Who are you?

380
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:49,720
I'll call people

381
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:51,120
if you don't get out!

382
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:57,680
Let me ask you.

383
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:01,200
Has Jun Linyuan found Feng Xiaowu?

384
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:03,800
I just don't get it.

385
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:04,560
She's just an ugly girl

386
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:06,240
who stole the Celestial Fruit.

387
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,120
Why can't you just leave her alone?

388
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:09,560
Don't talk about her like this!

389
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:13,840
She smells quite like the fairy.

390
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:16,320
Fairy is much prettier than you!

391
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:18,680
And she is a kind and brave girl

392
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:21,880
who's willing to help people!

393
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:23,960
You are just a girl
who's abandoned by Jun Linyuan!

394
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,920
You have no right to judge her!

395
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,120
However,

396
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:32,720
you smell quite like that fairy.

397
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:38,840
If your lower face is covered,

398
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:41,000
I may even mistake you for her.

399
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,760
But, she risked her own life

400
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:46,440
and saved my life bravely.

401
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:49,040
You will see when I bring her here.

402
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:50,760
There's a world

403
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,600
of difference between you and her!

404
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:53,960
My goodness!

405
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:55,720
Yu Mingye must've been

406
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:57,040
brainwashed by me

407
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:58,480
in the Frozen Forest.

408
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:00,720
Does he even know what he's talking about?

409
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,080
I heard

410
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:06,120
that Jun Linyuan has caught Feng Xiaowu.

411
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:07,480
And,

412
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:09,640
he's interrogating her to find out
the whereabouts of the Celestial Fruit.

413
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,680
If you want to save her,

414
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,080
you should follow Jun Linyuan.

415
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:16,440
He'll sooner or later get back
to where he locks her up.

416
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,760
He's finally gone!

417
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:30,520
Jun Linyuan!

418
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:33,280
Nothing good has happened
since you showed up!

419
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:01,160
Jun Linyuan, are you serious?

420
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:03,400
It's after 1:00 a.m.,

421
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:05,600
yet you are still not here!

422
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:13,280
No wonder people say

423
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:16,240
good-looking men are not reliable!

424
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,120
If I trust him again,

425
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:21,680
I'll be a pig!

426
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:52,200
Boss Jun, have some warm tea!

427
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:55,280
Who is it?

428
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,400
It's you.

429
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:10,320
Young Master Feng, morning!

430
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:17,920
Has His Highness Jun got up?

431
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:19,160
He's in meditation.

432
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,000
What's up?

433
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,640
I went to the town

434
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:25,400
and bought some medicinal herbs and elixirs

435
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:27,160
for His Highness Jun

436
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:28,640
and you.

437
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:32,600
In that case, please come in.

438
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,200
Your Highness Jun!

439
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:43,120
Your Highness Jun!

440
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:45,280
There isn't much good stuff
in this remote place.

441
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:47,760
It took me so long to find these.

442
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:49,920
Hope you'll like them!

443
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:51,400
What are they?

444
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:54,960
This is lucid ganoderma.

445
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,880
This is deer penis.

446
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:01,360
And also, this one.

447
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:06,280
Take a look.

448
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:07,640
They are very therapeutic!

449
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,480
You also think I have a kidney problem?

450
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:19,960
What kidney problem?

451
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:21,200
Get out!

452
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:22,800
Your Highness!

453
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:25,160
I brought these to you
to improve your spirit energy!

454
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:26,280
I said, get out!

455
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:47,640
Boss Jun!

456
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:59,040
Instead of making fun of me,

457
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:01,120
you'd better figure out

458
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,320
why the people from Darknight Court

459
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:04,880
have been following us

460
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,240
ever since we arrived in the Border City.

461
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:07,520
Boss Jun,

462
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:10,240
are you suspecting
that our whereabouts has been exposed?

463
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:10,920
Not only that,

464
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:13,040
there must be a spy around us.

465
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:15,960
Who would that be?

466
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:18,280
Lord Bi?

467
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:21,240
Or someone from the Fengs?

468
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:23,080
Feng Yiran?

469
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:24,440
Feng Liu?

470
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:27,480
Don't tell me it's Feng Wu!

471
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:28,920
She is the most suspicious one!

472
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:29,880
How come!

473
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:30,720
She's so pretty!

474
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:31,440
And...

475
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:33,880
She is also a good cook!

476
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:38,680
Have we met before?

477
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:42,920
Anyway, the most important thing

478
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:45,000
is to find out what relationship

479
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:47,880
between Feng Wu and Darknight Court is.

480
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:50,120
Feng Wu.

481
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,000
Feng Xiaowu.

482
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,240
I want the Phoenix Sword!

483
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:59,000
Whoever finds it first owns it!

484
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,400
But you said you wanted His Highness only,

485
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:01,600
and the Phoenix Sword would be mine!

486
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:03,520
How come you changed your mind suddenly?

487
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,600
The situation is different now.

488
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:06,680
I need the Phoenix Sword

489
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:08,760
to make me the head of the Feng family

490
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:10,520
so that I'll deserve
to be His Highness Jun's wife.

491
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:13,160
Besides, whoever is more capable

492
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:15,040
should be the successor of the Fengs.

493
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,080
What?

494
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:17,360
Brother.

495
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:19,880
If you give me the sword,

496
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,320
I will certainly lead
our family to a better future.

497
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:24,520
So you still know that I'm your brother!

498
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:26,400
I am the eldest of the Fengs!

499
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:27,960
How dare you to talk to me like this?

500
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,360
Listen up! When I return to the capital...

501
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:30,680
So what?

502
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:32,440
You'll complain to father about me again?

503
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:33,080
You...

504
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:39,840
No matter what, I've made up my mind.

505
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:42,560
I want the Phoenix Sword!

506
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:45,080
Whoever finds it first owns it!

507
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:47,600
If you think it's unfair,

508
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,040
just come and get it!

509
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:53,080
Alright, Feng Liu!

510
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:54,680
You are really fully-fledged now!

511
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,120
I guess our siblinghood

512
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:57,480
means nothing to you!

513
00:29:58,440 --> 00:29:59,360
But,

514
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:00,480
even if you become

515
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,760
the successor of the Fengs,

516
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,920
you think His Highness Jun
will be interested in you?

517
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:05,800
You...

518
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:09,200
Fine!

519
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:12,600
Then let's wait

520
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:14,080
and see!

521
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:19,120
You disrespectful brat!

522
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:21,400
I know whom you've
been meeting with in secret!

523
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:23,280
I'll teach you a lesson

524
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:24,840
after we get back to the capital!

525
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:31,120
Where are you taking me this time?

526
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:32,240
Feng Xiaowu.

527
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:37,680
To find the clue
to the whereabouts of Feng Xiaowu.

528
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:41,560
That Old Man Ba has told you

529
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:42,400
Feng Xiaowu

530
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,280
was taken by Yu Mingye

531
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:45,840
and the 108 bandits on Mount Liang...

532
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:49,760
Old Man Ba did mention
the bandits on Mount Liang,

533
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:51,880
but he didn't mention any number.

534
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:53,600
How did you know it?

535
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:57,720
I remember it wrong.

536
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:01,040
It's probably something I heard from a play.

537
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:03,080
Gosh, that scared me!

538
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:04,600
It was so close!

539
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:10,120
You didn't sleep well last night?

540
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:12,840
It's all your fault!

541
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,920
You said you wanted to meet me

542
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,520
at midnight.

543
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:17,920
When did I

544
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:19,840
say that?

545
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:21,840
Forget it.

546
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:22,960
I misunderstood.

547
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:28,320
What are you doing?

548
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:30,440
I wanna ask you

549
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:32,440
to stop the trickeries,

550
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:34,280
in case you can't sleep at night.

551
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:41,640
By the way,

552
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:43,920
where are Feng Xun and Xuan Yi?

553
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:45,960
They have other things to do.

554
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:01,880
You are also fond of Miss Wu?

555
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,080
But I don't think

556
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:05,160
you have a chance.

557
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:07,080
I don't?

558
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,160
She's pretty and nice.

559
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:09,840
Many young men

560
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:11,920
are attracted to her in the Border City.

561
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:15,040
I have an idea for you.

562
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:16,640
You only need to buy something from me.

563
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:35,440
You said you wanted to find Feng Xiaowu.

564
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:37,120
Why did you drag me here to eat?

565
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:41,800
Your Highness Jun,

566
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:44,200
I don't think it's the best way

567
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:46,680
to find a person in a big city like this.

568
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:49,720
You also asked Lord Bi to help you.

569
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:51,080
Let's go ask him.

570
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:54,040
If he can't even find her,

571
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:55,320
then we are

572
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:56,920
just wasting our time.

573
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:11,560
How's the fish?

574
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:14,480
It tastes good!

575
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,360
Thank you!

576
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:17,400
Can it compare to the fish you grilled?

577
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:18,480
Of course...

578
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:21,560
Feng Xun, let me grill the fish for you.

579
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:22,720
I'm really good at grilling fish.

580
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:25,160
Of course, the fish here tastes better.

581
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:28,120
I don't even know how to grill fish.

582
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:33,000
I'm wondering
if the Darknight Court grills fish.

583
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:34,400
How would I know that?

584
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:35,560
They might only know

585
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,920
how to cook beggar's chicken.

586
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:43,040
By the way, why do you ask?

587
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:44,040
Nothing.

588
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:45,840
Have some more if you like it.

589
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:04,200
I also sent Feng Xun
and Xuan Yi to find Feng Xiaowu.

590
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:06,080
We'll meet them later at Lord Bi's.

591
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:07,760
It'll be late after we are back.

592
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:10,520
Okay.

593
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:16,710
Oh!

594
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:18,920
My mom asked me
to decoct some medicine for her.

595
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:20,840
She's got a headache

596
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:21,840
recently,

597
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:23,000
and it's been boring her.

598
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:24,360
I'm thinking

599
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:26,280
maybe I can go back first.

600
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:28,190
You can continue

601
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,560
the search by yourself?

602
00:34:38,150 --> 00:34:39,480
They'll go to Lord Bi's.

603
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:41,800
So there'll be no one in their house.

604
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:54,600
I finally got a chance to stay
in the same mansion with him,

605
00:34:54,710 --> 00:34:57,040
but how come it's so hard
to meet His Highness?

606
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:03,280
Hey, you!

607
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:05,280
Have you seen His Highness Jun?

608
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:06,280
Miss Liu,

609
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:07,280
His Highness Jun

610
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:08,720
went out this morning with Miss Wu.

611
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:09,960
They are not back yet.

612
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:12,520
Just the two of them?

613
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:14,080
Yes. Just the two of them.

614
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:20,360
It's you again, Feng Wu!

615
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:31,480
Feng Xiaowu.

616
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:34,320
Where are you?

617
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:38,000
I'm here to save you, Feng Xiaowu!

618
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:40,720
What are you looking for?

619
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:45,360
Do you need any help?

620
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:48,360
So, it's an ambush!

621
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:50,600
I heard you calling Feng Xiaowu.

622
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,600
Why do you come here to find her?

623
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:54,480
Do you think

624
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:55,800
I'll tell you?

625
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,360
Do you think you can

626
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:58,880
leave here without telling me?

627
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:01,760
No one can stop me!

628
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:09,920
Don't think you can get away!

629
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:31,120
I thought you went to Lord Bi's.

630
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:34,640
You've been following me.

631
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:35,760
Now we finally meet,

632
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:36,880
why are you leaving so soon?

633
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:41,880
Three versus one.

634
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,280
It's not a fair fight.

635
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:44,680
When did Darknight Court

636
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:47,040
begin to care for fairness?

637
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:09,540
(Feng's Mansion)

638
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:36,000
Feng Wu! You are so calculating!

639
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:39,200
You went out with His Highness Jun in secret!

640
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,600
What do you want?

641
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:43,280
You played the tricks over and over again.

642
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:45,920
Don't you feel ashamed?

643
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:54,360
I'm so tired of looking at your face!

644
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:56,760
Without it,

645
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:59,800
His Highness Jun wouldn't even look at you!

646
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:01,880
In that case, you won't be able

647
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,120
to do anything
that discredits the Feng family!

648
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:06,520
How dare you to hurt me in public like this?

649
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:10,040
I really hate it

650
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:11,440
that you always act like a shoo-in

651
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:13,040
no matter in what kinda situation!

652
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:14,640
I'll disfigure your face!

653
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:15,960
I'll blind you!

654
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:16,920
Stop!

655
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:20,520
Don't hurt her!

656
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,000
If you dare,

657
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:23,560
I... I'll call help!

658
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:26,080
You are just a maid!

659
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:28,120
How dare you to threaten me?

660
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:30,880
I can't touch Feng Wu,

661
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,360
but I can make you suffer!

662
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:26,840
Your Highness Jun, you always gang up on me!

663
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:27,800
You did it last time.

664
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:29,040
And you are doing it again!

665
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:30,640
Shame on you!

666
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:32,000
We don't care about rules

667
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:33,320
when dealing with a person like you!

668
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:34,880
Save it!

669
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:36,120
Such a hypocrite!

670
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:43,080
If you want to fight one-on-one,

671
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:44,560
let's do it.

672
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:46,360
But, if I win,

673
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:48,280
you need to tell me

674
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:49,640
why you place a spy

675
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,160
