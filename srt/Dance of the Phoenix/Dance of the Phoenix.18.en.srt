2
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:40,820
(Episode 18)

3
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:59,080
The second floor of the Library
is off-limits.

4
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:00,400
This floor

5
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:04,600
is open to all disciples to borrow books.

6
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,640
I've noticed you for a while.

7
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,320
Though I've never said anything,

8
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:18,600
I feel there's a connection of some sort

9
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,240
between you and me.

10
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:24,600
I'm sure you've also sensed the same thing.

11
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,680
And from your eyes, I can see

12
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,240
that you are looking for something.

13
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,760
I can't tell you the answer.

14
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:37,240
But they might be able to.

15
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:46,360
This is the key
to the side door of the Library.

16
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,240
You can have the run of this place

17
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,320
in the future if you'd like.

18
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,560
But don't tell

19
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:57,640
anybody else about this,

20
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,800
including His Highness Jun.

21
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:08,920
Why do you mention him in particular?

22
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,280
Junior Sister.

23
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,800
Feng Wu is being punished.

24
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,320
Her spirit energy
must have decreased a lot.

25
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:29,960
Take this.

26
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,360
This...

27
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:35,240
This is the Celestial Pill
from Celestial Palace.

28
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,080
Yes.

29
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:37,880
I knew you'd recognize it.

30
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,080
Senior Sister...

31
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:41,680
Goddess Zuo,

32
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,480
please don't call me Junior Sister anymore.

33
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,760
I've never been admitted
into Celestial Palace

34
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,040
and taught by the leader.

35
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:49,880
So it doesn't count.

36
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:51,760
Zhao Ge.

37
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,280
Zhao Ge.

38
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,120
We should treat each other

39
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,600
like we used to.

40
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,080
Don't let the others

41
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,400
affect you.

42
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:02,560
Anyway,

43
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:03,960
you have the pill now.

44
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:06,040
Hope it can help you.

45
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,390
Boss Jun,

46
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,040
are you alright?

47
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,160
Where's Feng Wu?

48
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:29,560
Wu said she needed to go back
to take care of something.

49
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,720
She should be back to her room.

50
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,600
After all, it's Junwu Academy.
She'll be fine.

51
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,720
The relationship between you
and His Highness Jun

52
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,600
is destined to be tough.

53
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,960
If you two are determined to be together,

54
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:02,400
it'll bring you endless mishaps.

55
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,760
Supervisor Wu,

56
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,240
isn't what you said a little extreme?

57
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,200
Why are we destined to have a tough relationship?

58
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,640
I don't follow.

59
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,120
You are not you.

60
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,520
Yet he is he.

61
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:20,040
Based on what your horoscope signs suggest,

62
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,200
your destiny has long been predetermined.

63
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,320
You've got to know clearly

64
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,840
what you really want.

65
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:30,600
Don't forget your initial purpose

66
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:32,600
just because of affection.

67
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:37,760
I'm telling you this

68
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:41,960
from my own experience.

69
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,000
Supervisor Wu!

70
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,600
Remember.

71
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,240
Don't step into the off-limits.

72
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,840
I am not I.

73
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,000
Yet he is he.

74
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,360
I'm your Master Mu Jiuzhou.

75
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:02,240
I know you don't belong here.

76
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,240
But, remember,

77
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,680
from now on,

78
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:05,960
you'll be Feng Wu.

79
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:08,120
If you want to find out who you really are

80
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,760
and why you got here,

81
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,920
you gotta live your life well.

82
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:23,980
(Feng's Mansion)

83
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,040
Your Highness.

84
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:28,320
What brought you here?

85
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,160
Please come in.

86
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,000
No need.

87
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,840
I'm only here to ask

88
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,080
if Feng Wu is back.

89
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,120
My Lady?

90
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,480
She's not back yet.

91
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,200
What happened?

92
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:38,920
Don't worry.

93
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:41,080
She's probably taking a walk somewhere.

94
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,560
I'll go keep looking for her.

95
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,160
Okay. If there's anything,

96
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,920
please let us know, Your Highness.

97
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:47,960
I will.

98
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:51,800
Don't tell Mrs. Feng that I came by.

99
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:54,560
Wait for my news.

100
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:58,980
(Feng's Mansion)

101
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,480
It's so late.

102
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,080
Zhao Ge must be worried sick.

103
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,680
And I haven't heard anything
from that poker face!

104
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:18,360
He's gone to the Divine Hall
for a whole day now.

105
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:20,840
Who is it?

106
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,200
Hey!

107
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,600
You almost burned my hair!

108
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,780
It's you!

109
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:08,460
(Auspicious Clouds)

110
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,680
So, what were you doing over there?

111
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,120
The second floor of the Library

112
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,920
is a forbidden zone of Junwu Academy.

113
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,440
In that case,

114
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:18,280
what were you doing there at this hour?

115
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,080
I...

116
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:23,480
I was studying

117
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,920
in case I'd fall behind.

118
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:26,840
So, I'm also allowed

119
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,120
to study there.

120
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,680
It's your excuse!

121
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:31,800
Okay! Alright!

122
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:33,200
You've seen that

123
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:35,200
there's energy barrier in the forbidden zone.

124
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:37,160
We have no way to break in.

125
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:38,600
How about this?

126
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:40,670
Let's keep it a secret

127
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,440
and pretend that we've never been here.

128
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,240
What do you say?

129
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:45,520
Okay.

130
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:49,320
You've studied for long.

131
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,240
You must be hungry.

132
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,320
Shall we go out and eat something?

133
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:53,680
No.

134
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,440
As cultivators,

135
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:57,600
we can't always think about
satisfying our taste buds.

136
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,040
I know you too well.

137
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:01,920
Don't make yourself become a fogey

138
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,120
like those people.

139
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:03,960
We are different

140
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,920
from Jun Linyuan and the others.

141
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:06,880
Let's go!

142
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:10,760
No! I'm not going!

143
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,040
Zhao Ge.

144
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,320
Zhao Ge.

145
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:51,200
Wake up.

146
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:52,720
Don't sleep here.

147
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:56,920
Wu.

148
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,920
Where have you been this late?

149
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,840
His Highness Jun has been looking for you.

150
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,400
Jun Linyuan

151
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,200
came here to look for me?

152
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,040
Not only that,

153
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:08,480
he almost turned the entire
Junwu Academy upside down!

154
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,280
He's left for the Feng's Mansion.

155
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:11,720
So...

156
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,520
So my mom knows already?

157
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,080
Oh, no! I have to go back.

158
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:15,960
Don't bother.

159
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,320
He was just here.

160
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,520
He told me you'd be back soon

161
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:19,520
and asked me not to worry.

162
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,280
Then he went to the Feng's Mansion to inform them.

163
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,120
That's good to know.

164
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,400
Then have a good night's sleep.

165
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:31,640
Don't forget to explain it
to His Highness Jun tomorrow.

166
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:32,960
He was really worried about you.

167
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:35,880
I will.

168
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:37,640
Now, go to bed.

169
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,680
You silly bird!

170
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,640
What's the relationship
between Wu Youdao and Master?

171
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:14,800
Why does he seem

172
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,160
so familiar to me?

173
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,680
Well...

174
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:18,760
I have no idea.

175
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:21,280
But it may be an opportunity for you.

176
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:23,600
And Wu Youdao could be the key.

177
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:26,040
Since you've already entered Junwu Academy,

178
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,560
just focus on cultivation

179
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,560
and don't be distracted by other things.

180
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:32,120
Always remember your purpose of being here.

181
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,400
Which is to awaken Master

182
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:34,840
and then leave.

183
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,160
What?

184
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,960
You don't wanna leave anymore?

185
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,960
Are you in love with that...

186
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:40,920
I'm not!

187
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,640
I'm not in love with Jun Linyuan!

188
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,640
Did I say his name?

189
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,040
You just gave yourself away!

190
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:50,680
You can fool others
but you can't fool yourself.

191
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:52,480
Just think about it.

192
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:56,560
After all, you are different
from the people here.

193
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:59,560
Though you spend all the time together
and nothing's happened yet,

194
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,760
no one can guarantee that your body

195
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,520
won't change eventually.

196
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:05,400
Stop talking!

197
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:06,920
I know it.

198
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,120
-Feng Wu.
-Your Highness.

199
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:24,760
I still have things to do.

200
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:25,840
I've got to go now.

201
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,480
Our relationship is destined to be tough.

202
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:37,400
If so, I can't put him in trouble.

203
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,680
I know it is the right thing to do.

204
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,120
But...

205
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:42,920
Hurry! We'll be late!

206
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:44,040
Come on! Hurry!

207
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:45,920
Where are you going?

208
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:46,720
You don't know?

209
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,080
Holy Queen Gao came
to the academy for inspection.

210
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,080
We don't have classes this afternoon.

211
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:50,440
Stop talking to her! Let's go!

212
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:53,640
I heard that Her Majesty
asked Zuo Qingluan to accompany her.

213
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:54,960
People say that Her Majesty

214
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,760
has already seen her as daughter-in-law.

215
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:58,600
She'll most likely be the Spiritual Princess.

216
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:00,040
So it's not just a rumor!

217
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:00,600
To be honest,

218
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,360
she and His Highness Jun
are really a perfect match.

219
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:04,240
Whatever! I'm not that lucky anyway.

220
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:04,920
Let's go take a look.

221
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:06,200
Come on! Let's go.

222
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,720
Feng Wu! Feng Wu!

223
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,400
Why does he always follow me?

224
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:22,360
Where are you going?

225
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:23,560
We don't have classes this afternoon.

226
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,280
So I come to the Library to study.

227
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,280
You've been acting mysteriously.

228
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:30,480
Now, confess.

229
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:33,360
Are you hiding something from us?

230
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,120
Not at all.

231
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,320
What could I possibly hide from you?

232
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,080
Oh, by the way. Holy Queen Gao is here.

233
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,920
Don't you wanna go take a look?

234
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:43,840
I came here to get you
so that we can go together.

235
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:46,280
To be fair, Holy Queen Gao

236
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,360
is quite amiable.

237
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:51,240
She loves Boss Jun so much,

238
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:53,960
and she cares a lot about me and Xuan Yi.

239
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,040
Even so, I just don't like her.

240
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,920
I like a nagging person like my mom,

241
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,240
or someone like your mom.

242
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:03,200
What's special about my mom?

243
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:05,600
It's hard to explain.

244
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,600
But you can see so much joy in her eyes

245
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,120
when she looks at you.

246
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:10,760
You know what?

247
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:13,400
Holy Queen Gao came to Junwu Academy

248
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,600
for her birthday celebration.

249
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,120
So how's that related to me?

250
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:19,840
I haven't finished.

251
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,920
On her birthday,

252
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,880
she will pick one male and one female

253
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,120
from the newly-recruited disciples

254
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:28,160
to perform Double Swordsmanship
that was created by Master Mu.

255
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,440
The male disciple

256
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,480
will certainly be His Highness Jun.

257
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,080
As for the female disciple...

258
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,080
Needless to say,

259
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:41,720
it must be Zuo Qingluan.

260
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:44,360
Due to the limited cultivation base,

261
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,680
none of the other disciples is her match.

262
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:48,160
Who else could it be?

263
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,560
You!

264
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:52,680
I'm not interested at all.

265
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:53,480
Hey!

266
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:54,760
What's wrong with you?

267
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:55,720
Think about it.

268
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:57,160
Won't you be jealous

269
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:59,080
if she performs Double Swordsmanship

270
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,240
with Jun Linyuan?

271
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,520
Why would I be jealous?

272
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:05,880
Hey...

273
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:09,840
You were just fine a couple of days ago.

274
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:15,160
It's so hard to understand you girls!

275
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:27,120
Greetings to you, Your Majesty!

276
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,240
Rise.

277
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:37,720
I'm so impressed

278
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:40,600
by your energy

279
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:43,640
and your thirst for righteousness.

280
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:47,240
You represent the disciples of Junwu Academy.

281
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:51,200
You are also the future
of Qianyuan Continent.

282
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:56,560
Two paragons of virtue will be picked

283
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:58,080
from our disciples to perform

284
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,720
Double Swordsmanship
on Your Majesty's birthday.

285
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:03,200
It's not only an honor to them,

286
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:06,480
but also an honor to Junwu Academy.

287
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,680
I actually wasn't going
to have a celebration.

288
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,480
It's just a birthday.

289
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:13,480
There's no need to make it a big deal.

290
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:16,240
But His Majesty

291
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,320
enjoys a blast,

292
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:20,680
and he also wants to see

293
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:23,600
the abilities of the new recruits.

294
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:29,080
His Majesty and Your Majesty love people,

295
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,720
and care a great deal of the young disciples,

296
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:34,640
which is indeed a blessing
for our Junwu Clan!

297
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:36,160
I think the male representative

298
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:40,360
should be His Highness Jun.

299
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,120
As for the female representative...

300
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,840
It should be Senior Sister Qingluan!

301
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:51,720
No one is more qualified than her

302
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,560
to perform together

303
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:55,200
with His Highness Jun.

304
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,000
Mu Yao!

305
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,840
Behave yourself in front of Her Majesty!

306
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,760
Qingluan is a good girl.

307
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:05,960
I do like her.

308
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:09,480
His Majesty will also be happy

309
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:12,680
to see her performing with Linyuan.

310
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:14,110
They are such a perfect match.

311
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:18,680
Your Majesty, you will certainly
enjoy a lovely birthday this year.

312
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,240
Your Majesty,

313
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:24,590
I have a suggestion.

314
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,960
Linyuan, what's on your mind?

315
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:29,800
We can hold a challenge.

316
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:32,400
From today till your birthday,

317
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:35,560
all the female disciples
can participate into the challenge,

318
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:36,720
which is like a "wheel battle."

319
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:39,800
Whoever stands to the end
will be selected for the performance.

320
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:42,600
Linyuan, your suggestion is good.

321
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:45,480
Which female disciple do you prefer?

322
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,040
I don't have

323
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,640
a particular recommendation.

324
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:51,320
I just think that a rash decision

325
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:52,640
won't be convincing.

326
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,320
Whoever is capable the most
should be the ultimate choice.

327
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,880
What Linyuan said makes sense.

328
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,240
Then let's do it.

329
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:04,240
If nobody makes to the end of the challenge,

330
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,440
then you'll still team up

331
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:08,840
with Qingluan.

332
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:12,720
I'm really looking forward to this!

333
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:21,480
If Feng Wu

334
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,000
misbehaves again,

335
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:25,160
I'll report it to Dean Ning

336
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,440
and expel her from Junwu Academy!

337
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:32,680
Supervisor Wu,

338
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:35,320
please say something!

339
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:36,920
Master Zhao,

340
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:38,520
calm down!

341
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,480
Please calm down!

342
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:45,600
This is the quiz of this time, right?

343
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:47,640
You haven't got a chance

344
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,000
to check the disciples' names

345
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:51,920
after grading the papers, have you?

346
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,120
I haven't.

347
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,120
Now, take a look at this paper.

348
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,200
I remember this one.

349
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,200
It's the most insightful answer

350
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,000
I've ever seen.

351
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:14,360
But I haven't got a chance to check the name.

352
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,240
I don't know whose paper it is.

353
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,840
Look closer, then.

354
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:24,880
Which disciple is it?

355
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:29,120
I've never noticed

356
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,920
there's such an
outstanding disciple in my class,

357
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:34,200
who even learned the Cultivation Method

358
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:36,200
and Spiritual Cognition ahead of time.

359
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:39,160
Actually, this disciple
is that trouble-maker Feng Wu

360
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:41,440
you just mentioned.

361
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,040
But...

362
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,320
You want to ask

363
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:56,120
how she managed
to learn the things you taught

364
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,680
when she was constantly
driven out of the class by you

365
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:02,360
and punished with standing outside.

366
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:03,920
Am I right?

367
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:06,080
Yes! Exactly!

368
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:11,360
Although she was punished
by standing outside every time,

369
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:14,880
she still learned everything
you taught by heart

370
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,400
and reflected her hard work on her paper.

371
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:18,560
Moreover, she studied late
every day in the Library

372
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:21,040
to look through the books
and digest what she has learned.

373
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:24,600
That's why she felt tired and sleepy

374
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,080
during the day.

375
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:27,400
So,

376
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,920
you still want to expel

377
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:34,240
such an excellent disciple from the academy?

378
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:24,840
Boss Jun.

379
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:28,480
You are still up?

380
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,440
It's okay. You can go to bed first.

381
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,400
You've been absent-minded

382
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:34,960
since you met His Majesty and Her Majesty.

383
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,400
What's wrong?

384
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:51,800
No worry.

385
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,760
I know he is a big mouth.

386
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:54,880
But he's asleep now.

387
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:56,640
You can trust me.

388
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:58,880
I won't tell anybody else.

389
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:01,360
I'm nervous.

390
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:04,600
I hope Feng Wu can perform

391
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:06,840
the swordsmanship with me
in front of His Majesty and Her Majesty.

392
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,080
In that case,

393
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,440
it'll be much easier for me

394
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:12,240
to recommend her as my Spiritual Princess.

395
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:14,880
But I find her

396
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:17,320
quite cold and distant these days.

397
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:19,800
And I don't know why.

398
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:23,920
You won't be able

399
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,200
to find an answer to that in books.

400
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,080
Why don't you

401
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:30,600
just go ask her?

402
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,000
Ask her?

403
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,080
Yes.

404
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:34,920
It's very hard to read

405
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:37,640
a girl's mind.

406
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:50,840
Senior Sister, congratulations
to you in advance!

407
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
When His Majesty and Her Majesty see

408
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:55,160
what a perfect match you
and His Highness Jun are,

409
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:57,200
they may issue an edict right on site

410
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,680
and make you the Spiritual Princess.

411
00:22:58,840 --> 00:22:59,560
That's right!

412
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,600
Senior Sister and His Highness Jun
are a match made in heaven.

413
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:02,560
No one deserves His Highness Jun

414
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,260
more than our Senior Sister.

415
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:07,520
Feng Wu is just a broken-winged phoenix now.

416
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,680
How can she compare to our Senior Sister?

417
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:12,000
But that Zhao Ge,
as a disciple of Celestial Palace,

418
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:13,640
is actually on Feng Wu's side,

419
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:14,920
which is so hateful!

420
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:22,360
No matter what,
Zhao Ge is my Master's daughter,

421
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:24,120
as well as my Junior Sister!

422
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:26,400
If you say those nonsense

423
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:28,800
to hurt our sisterhood again,

424
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:29,960
I'll punish you severely!

425
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,720
I heard you, Senior Sister!

426
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,280
The most important thing right now

427
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:39,240
is to earn a reputation
for our Celestial Palace.

428
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:49,120
Senior Sister always protects Zhao Ge.

429
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,600
I will let Zhao Ge pay big time

430
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,080
for being an ungrateful traitor!

431
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:01,840
Zhao Ge.

432
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:03,440
Why don't you go to bed?

433
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:05,320
Wu.

434
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:07,400
I wanna know

435
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:09,880
what you are going to do

436
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:11,800
about the challenge this time.

437
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:14,200
I don't have a plan.

438
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,120
It's irrelevant to me.

439
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:17,640
But I think

440
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:20,080
you should fight for it!

441
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:24,680
Give me a break.

442
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:25,880
I don't think so.

443
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:28,640
Listen to me.

444
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:32,920
Though Zuo Qingluan is my Senior Sister,

445
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:35,480
it's

446
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,520
a celebration for Her Majesty's birthday,

447
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:38,920
if you can perform on that day,

448
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:40,360
it must be so amazing,

449
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:41,240
and

450
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:42,840
no one would say Feng Wu

451
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:44,160
doesn't deserve His Highness Jun anymore.

452
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:47,200
Just let them talk.

453
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:48,480
I don't care.

454
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:52,040
The one who's meant to leave cannot be kept.

455
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,040
It's better that nothing has ever happened.

456
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:55,680
Everybody can see

457
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:57,160
that His Highness Jun is into you.

458
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:00,320
Wu, don't you wanna fight for him?

459
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:04,720
Look at you!

460
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:07,840
You always concern about others!

461
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,960
Stop worrying. Just go to sleep.

462
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,040
Feng Wu,

463
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:39,800
you really don't care about my feelings?

464
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:16,400
I just don't believe it!

465
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:18,400
Why can't I have

466
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:20,320
what Feng Wu has?

467
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:54,520
Master is about to be here.
I need to go to class.

468
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:57,840
Nobody will protect you

469
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:00,840
while Feng Wu isn't around, right?

470
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:08,000
You and Feng Wu

471
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:09,960
are both pathetic losers!

472
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:11,000
You'll be sorry

473
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,480
if you talk about Feng Wu like that again!

474
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,080
Here's a reminder for you.

475
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:16,760
I've got a bunch of witnesses here.

476
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,200
You attacked me first.

477
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:25,080
What? You are going
to disobey your Senior Sister?

478
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:29,040
Go back and tell Feng Wu

479
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:30,680
to put her tail between her legs

480
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,520
just like you do,

481
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:33,880
so that I can spare your life!

482
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:34,960
Dream on!

483
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:36,600
I'll tell my mom on you.

484
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:37,960
She won't forgive you!

485
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,760
You are the one who's dreaming!

486
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:42,720
Your mom has long abandoned you!

487
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:43,760
That's bullshit!

488
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,480
How dare you to fight back?!

489
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:03,120
Mu Yao!

490
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,720
Zhao Ge! Zhao Ge!

491
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:06,880
Zhao Ge!

492
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:09,120
Zhao Ge! Zhao Ge!

493
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:10,360
Mu Yao! What are you doing?

494
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:13,000
How could you do such a thing
to your classmate?

495
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:14,080
I did nothing wrong.

496
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:15,800
Zhao Ge attacked me first.

497
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:17,240
They've all seen it!

498
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,360
Even so,

499
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:29,800
you must have provoked her first!

500
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,160
Zhao Ge's cultivation base is not your match.

501
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:34,040
She wouldn't challenge you for no reason!

502
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:34,440
You...

503
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:36,120
She seems a little slow,

504
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,440
but she's not a fool at all!

505
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:44,800
If anything happens to her,

506
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:47,400
I won't let you off easily!

507
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:55,040
Zhao Ge.

508
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,640
I'm sorry!

509
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:58,360
I failed in protecting you!

510
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:08,320
You don't usually go to class.

511
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,800
What are you doing here today?

512
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,560
I found a pond

513
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,080
on the top of the back hill.

514
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:17,720
Would you like to go fishing with me?

515
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:20,240
Why do you always go to the back hill?

516
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:22,560
Master said the back hill was quite steep

517
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:24,160
and asked us to stay away from it.

518
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:25,400
I'm there for fun.

519
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:27,360
So, are you going or not?

520
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:28,200
I don't have time.

521
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:30,280
And I'm not in the mood.

522
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:31,800
I haven't found what I need yet.

523
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:33,160
I'm not going.

524
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:35,400
There's never an end to cultivation.

525
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:36,960
You gotta learn how to balance your life.

526
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:37,960
Let's go.

527
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:42,720
You are not you.

528
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,320
Yet he is he.

529
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:46,880
Based on what your horoscope signs suggest,

530
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,360
your destiny has long been predetermined.

531
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:52,000
You've got to know clearly

532
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:54,600
what you really want.

533
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:56,240
Yu Mingye,

534
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:57,880
if you want to take me to go fishing,

535
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:59,080
let's go!

536
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,560
Feng Wu! Feng Wu!

537
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:09,440
Bad news! Zhao Ge is hurt!

538
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:10,440
What happened?

539
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:13,040
It's ridiculous!

540
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,520
The school has just opened for a few days,

541
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:17,600
you already made such a big mistake!

542
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:20,960
Luckily, she was sent
to the doctor in time and saved.

543
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,120
Dean Ning.

544
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:23,560
Zhao Ge attacked me first.

545
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:25,160
It's the truth!

546
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,200
Really?

547
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:28,800
Then let's hear what others will say.

548
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:33,600
You two,

549
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:35,720
be honest and tell us

550
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:37,320
what you saw.

551
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,840
Dean and Supervisor,

552
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:42,040
we don't know why they argued with Zhao Ge.

553
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:44,000
But when we arrived at the scene,

554
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:45,880
they've already begun to hurt her.

555
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,160
That's a lie!

556
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,760
Dean, Supervisor,
please investigate carefully!

557
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:52,360
We really...

558
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:53,160
We really...

559
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:54,080
Enough!

560
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:56,080
You seriously hurt your classmate,

561
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:57,760
yet you are still making excuses

562
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:59,200
and showing no sign of repentance!

563
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:00,520
I'm so disappointed in you!

564
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:01,640
Supervisor Wu.

565
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:06,680
According to the article 28
of the Rules of Junwu Academy,

566
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,760
"One who bullies classmate

567
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,560
and shows no repentance

568
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:11,600
shall be held

569
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:14,520
in confinement for seven days."

570
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:15,560
Guards,

571
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:16,960
take her away.

572
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:22,760
Senior Sister! Senior Sister! Senior Sister!

573
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,880
Senior Sister! Senior Sister!

574
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:27,360
Senior Sister!

575
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:36,000
I failed in disciplining my Junior Sister.

576
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:37,960
Dean, Supervisor,
I'd like to accept your punishment.

577
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:39,440
Zuo Qingluan.

578
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:41,520
Although you weren't involved,

579
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:43,640
you are after all their Senior Sister.

580
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:45,080
How are you going

581
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:47,280
to deal with this problem?

582
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:48,800
Zhao Ge is a Junior Sister of my sect.

583
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:49,800
I hope you can allow me

584
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:51,960
to take care of her in person
until she's recovered,

585
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:54,120
so that I can make up
for my mistake of negligence.

586
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:55,520
Zhao Ge has been heavily hurt.

587
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:56,960
You think this is all you can do
to make up for your mistake?

588
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,240
That's something you are obligated to do!

589
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:03,280
In my opinion,

590
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:05,000
Celestial Palace encouraged its people

591
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:06,160
to hurt a disciple,

592
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:08,720
which will discredit our academy
if word gets out.

593
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:09,920
We can't let them off so easily.

594
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,600
If we do,

595
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:13,640
who can guarantee that Zhao Ge

596
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:15,080
won't get hurt again?

597
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:17,360
I will strictly discipline them.

598
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:18,440
If someone dares to do it again,

599
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:21,560
I will ask our sect leader to kick her
out of our palace to warn the others.

600
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:25,840
It's a fact that Zhao Ge
has been severely hurt.

601
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:27,600
I have to seek justice for her!

602
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:28,680
As far as I'm concerned,

603
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:32,600
the one who hurt her has been punished,

604
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:35,840
and Zuo Qingluan has made a promise.

605
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,400
Let's put this thing to an end.

606
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:40,560
You are all classmates.
You should try to be forgiving.

607
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:47,640
Dean Ning, I'm sorry!

608
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:49,880
I'm never a broad-minded person.

609
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:52,200
Since you all want to end this thing,

610
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:54,000
it'll be improper if I don't let go.

611
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:55,520
So, I've made my decision.

612
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:56,360
I'll participate into the challenge

613
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:59,120
to fight for the performer
spot on Her Majesty's birthday!

614
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:06,240
Zuo Qingluan seems to be the only one

615
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:07,960
who has signed up for the challenge so far.

616
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:09,160
In this case,

617
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:12,160
you mean you want to compete with her?

618
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:13,000
Yes.

619
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:15,040
Why do you do this?

620
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:17,600
Your people all bully Zhao Ge

621
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:19,360
and accuse her of being a traitor.

622
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:21,000
What will make them proud the most
would be for you

623
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:22,960
to perform on Her Majesty's birthday.

624
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,560
So, I won't let you get your way!

625
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:26,600
Besides, it's an open and fair competition.

626
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:28,000
Everybody can attend, right?

627
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:28,920
Of course!

628
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,600
I sincerely apologize again.

629
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:32,600
And I accept your challenge.

630
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:33,840
Good.

631
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:35,640
In this case,

632
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:38,200
I'll grant you two this opportunity.

633
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:39,480
The challenge

634
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:40,800
will take place in three days.

635
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:42,920
Whoever wins the challenge

636
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:45,480
will perform Double Swordsmanship.

637
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:53,120
(Righteous Teaching Hall)

638
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:54,960
"A challenge will take place in three days.

639
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:58,440
These disciples will have a battle over
the performer spot on Her Majesty's birthday."

640
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:00,880
Feng Wu and Zuo Qingluan?

641
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:02,160
Yeah.

642
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:04,520
A Senior-rank Spiritual Practitioner is going
to challenge a Great Spiritual Master?

643
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:06,720
She's literally looking for trouble.

644
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:08,160
Tell me about it!

645
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:09,520
Is she crazy?

646
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:12,800
It's going to be quite a show!

647
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:15,600
I extended a challenge on impulse!

648
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:17,120
Now what should I do?

649
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:17,960
Feng Wu,

650
00:34:18,150 --> 00:34:20,400
I tell you, you should just go for it.

651
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:22,440
I'll figure out a way to take her down.

652
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:23,670
I assure you that in three days,

653
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:25,800
she won't even be able to stand straight!

654
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:27,580
(Be Humble)

655
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:28,440
Don't do something foolish.

656
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:30,840
If anything bad
happened to her at this point,

657
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:33,150
people would naturally think
Feng Wu were behind it.

658
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:33,920
But...

659
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:36,320
Who put up

660
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:38,000
the notice this quickly?

661
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,150
What a busybody!

662
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:43,710
Now,

663
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:45,120
come with me.

664
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:47,760
I'll take you to a place.

665
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,630
You guys left without me again!

666
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:08,560
This place is breathtaking!

667
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:23,720
What is this place?

668
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:26,040
I named this place "Skyland."

669
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:27,840
I found this place by accident
when I was little.

670
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:30,920
I enjoyed flying around
with my sword back then.

671
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:32,560
"Skyland."

672
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:34,440
What a lovely name!

673
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:37,640
It's an ancient relic,

674
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:38,760
which

675
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,680
has already been formed
even before the establishment of Junwu Clan.

676
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:43,680
But there's no way to know
how long it's been in existence.

677
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:46,320
It's been that long?

678
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:49,640
I come here to cultivate

679
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:51,120
and enjoy the view

680
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:52,600
when I'm free.

681
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:58,920
And now, aside from me,

682
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:01,040
you are the only one who's visited here.

683
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:08,560
So,

684
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,200
you brought me here to...

685
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:12,400
There are only a couple of days left.

686
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:15,440
Your cultivation base for now

687
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:17,480
is far weaker than Zuo Qingyuan's.

688
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:19,960
I certainly know that.

689
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:21,760
So, you have to rely
on techniques to win her.

690
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:23,400
Junwu Clan features gold.

691
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:25,240
Our swordsmanship is invincible.

692
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:07,640
So incredible!

693
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:12,080
These skills have never been
showed to outsiders.

694
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:13,720
The key of the skills

695
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:15,640
lies in step moves instead of strength.

696
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:17,120
If you can master these skills,

697
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:20,400
you'll have a chance to win Zuo Qingyuan.

698
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:22,400
It's your turn now.

699
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:24,880
My turn?

700
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:26,360
You just demonstrated once.

701
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:27,760
It's so complicated.

702
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:29,600
I don't know how to do it.

703
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:56,880
For Zhao Ge,

704
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:59,840
and for you,

705
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:02,440
I've got to win the competition!

706
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:15,160
Senior Sister.

707
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:22,160
How is it going?

708
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:23,840
I've made a deal with the guard.

709
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:25,320
He will let you in.

710
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:39,600
Don't stay for too long.

711
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:17,400
Senior Sister! Senior Sister!

712
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:23,280
There are spells everywhere in this room.

713
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:26,280
My spirit energy
has been fully suppressed.

714
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:28,160
I'm in so much pain, Senior Sister!

715
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:37,400
Who gave you the right to do that?

716
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:39,920
I've told you,

717
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:41,320
no matter what,

718
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:43,120
you are not allowed to hurt Zhao Ge!

719
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:02,960
I made a mistake, Senior Sister!

720
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:05,200
I just don't understand.

721
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:08,600
Zhao Ge betrayed you,

722
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:11,360
but why do you still protect her?

723
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,440
You can have this.

724
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:38,760
Go ahead.

725
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:54,880
Don't cry!

726
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:01,320
