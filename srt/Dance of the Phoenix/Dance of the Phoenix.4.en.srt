00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:40,580
(Episode 4)

3
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:55,680
Boss Jun,

4
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,160
I think this is the Celestial Fruit.

5
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,640
In Yunlai Tavern just now,

6
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,160
it didn't give full play
to its power obviously.

7
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,480
Now sword riding is impossible in the cave.

8
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:05,440
So staying alert is the best policy.

9
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:10,240
Feng Xun and Xuan Yi,

10
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,280
-you two go outflank it.
-Stay away from His Highness Jun.

11
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,160
I will confront it head on.

12
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,920
I won't.

13
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:16,680
I will distract it.

14
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:18,120
You can take the chance
to get the Celestial Fruit.

15
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,000
Mu Yao, protect Feng Xiaowu.

16
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,800
Why should I?

17
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:42,560
Get out of the way.

18
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:20,280
Young master.

19
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,000
Don't be anxious.

20
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,480
After they have worn each other out,

21
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,960
we will take action to seize the fruit.

22
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,160
Under such a circumstance,

23
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:46,000
how can I coordinate with Little Parrot?

24
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,480
Xiaowu, why are you out?

25
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,120
Feng Xiaowu.

26
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,160
Feng Xiaowu, I told you not to come out.

27
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:21,880
Are you trying to distract His Highness Jun?

28
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:22,880
I am not.

29
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:26,320
It is unexpected that Jun Linyuan volunteered

30
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,830
to save a strange woman.

31
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:32,720
Young master, I think this is unusual.

32
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,240
Things are becoming interesting now.

33
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:38,800
I want whatever belongs to Jun Linyuan.

34
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,360
Whomever Jun Linyuan likes,

35
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,200
I want to seize her from him.

36
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,320
Young master,

37
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,320
the most important thing
for us now is the Celestial Fruit.

38
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:47,680
Don't get distracted by other things.

39
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,120
I know.

40
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,480
But I am determined

41
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,000
to get this girl.

42
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,800
Why does she

43
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,960
look familiar to me?

44
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,440
Feng Xun.

45
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:17,000
Xiaowu, why are you here?

46
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,320
Hurry to find a place to hide yourself.

47
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,440
Now the situation is bad.

48
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,880
You go lure away the Firecloud Giant Hawk

49
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,360
to allow Jun Linyuan to take a breath.

50
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,880
I will help you get the Celestial Fruit.

51
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,320
OK.

52
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,680
This girl is quite capable.

53
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,080
I am interested in her.

54
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,440
Young master,

55
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,400
if we don't take action now,

56
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,960
the Celestial Fruit will be taken by others.

57
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,000
No need to hurry.

58
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,720
After the Firecloud Giant Hawk is defeated,

59
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,040
we will make a move.

60
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,440
It is done.

61
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,880
I finally got you.

62
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,160
You!

63
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:02,720
You two guys!

64
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,440
Are you all right?

65
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,560
Xuan Yi, look at him!

66
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:18,480
Where is the Firecloud Giant Hawk?

67
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:19,680
Why can't it be seen?

68
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:20,960
Could it

69
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,240
has been eradicated
both physically and spiritually?

70
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,360
Where is the Celestial Fruit?

71
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,360
It is over there.

72
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,280
The mission is finally completed.

73
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,760
Congratulations, Your Highness Jun.

74
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,200
You want to see it, right?

75
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,000
Now have a good look.

76
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:10,320
Jun Linyuan.

77
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,440
Keep your shirt on.

78
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,560
You're the fairy who saved me last time.

79
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,120
I have to thank you for saving me.

80
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,640
But, it is a pity that

81
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:29,040
you are on Jun Linyuan's side.

82
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:32,400
If a scar is left on your face,

83
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,120
someone's heart will ache, right?

84
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,000
Give me the Celestial Fruit.

85
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,200
Are you kidding?

86
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,560
You can kill her
or do whatever you like to her.

87
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,800
He turned against me.

88
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,320
I should have seized
the Celestial Fruit just now.

89
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,720
She isn't one of your people?

90
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:07,680
No.

91
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:10,040
She is just a passer-by.

92
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:11,720
She has nothing to do with me.

93
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:14,280
I shouldn't have saved you.

94
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,600
Young master, how should we deal with her?

95
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,760
If we can't get the Celestial Fruit,

96
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:25,160
it is not bad for us to get one person.

97
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:29,760
Xiaowu!

98
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:31,360
Boss Jun.

99
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,880
How could you say that?

100
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,320
Why should we give away the Celestial Fruit

101
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,480
that we fought hard to get

102
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:40,520
to someone we don't know well?

103
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,360
Now Xiaowu is in the hands of Yu Mingye,

104
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:43,920
can you set your mind at rest?

105
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:19,400
You are awake.

106
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,120
What do you want to do?

107
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,280
Let go of me.

108
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:46,520
Take a guess.

109
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:48,320
If your guess is right, I will tell you.

110
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:50,120
I don't have any time to guess.

111
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:04,840
Oops!

112
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,160
I beg you

113
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:10,880
to save me.

114
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,000
As a matter of fact,

115
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:14,720
I am not one of Jun Linyuan's people.

116
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:16,520
Then you...

117
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,480
It is

118
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:20,800
a long story.

119
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,160
I didn't expect

120
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:33,800
the Loveless Insect Venom

121
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:36,080
was activated by a person of unknown origin.

122
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,440
What is the matter, Boss Jun?

123
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:59,360
Did you regret handing
over Feng Xiaowu to Yu Mingye?

124
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:01,960
It is too late.

125
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,000
Who hit me with the stone?

126
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:30,440
To Jun Linyuan,

127
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,040
Feng Xiaowu is in my hands.

128
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,640
If you want her to stay alive,

129
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:35,720
come to meet me by the lake.

130
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:36,920
If you don't come,

131
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,240
I will let all the people across
Qianyuan Continent know that

132
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,640
you are cold-blooded and ungrateful.

133
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:47,920
From Yu Mingye.

134
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,640
Your Highness, just ignore her.

135
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,720
We must hurry to take
the Celestial Fruit to the capital.

136
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:56,960
We can't do that.

137
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:57,920
Xiaowu

138
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,720
has helped us get the Celestial Fruit.

139
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:00,880
If we leave her behind like this,

140
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,680
we will be heartless
and unreasonable persons.

141
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,800
This maybe a trick played by Yu Mingye.

142
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:10,760
His aim is not to lead us
to save Feng Xiaowu,

143
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,240
but to seize the Celestial Fruit.

144
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,160
That's right.

145
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,520
Feng Xun, Xuan Yi,

146
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,760
go check it out.

147
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:01,760
Yu Mingye!

148
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,120
How come you two are here?

149
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:09,320
Why hasn't Jun Linyuan come?

150
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:10,480
Where is Feng Xiaowu?

151
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:11,590
Hand her over.

152
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:14,280
It seems that she got it.

153
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,680
Fine. Let's have a fight.

154
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:02,720
It's a wish for victory.

155
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,040
It can make you smile.

156
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:06,440
Mu Yao.

157
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:10,160
Your Celestial Palace has special methods
to care for the immortal grass.

158
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,120
I want you to keep it now.

159
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,040
I promise I will protect
the Celestial Fruit well.

160
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:20,520
I will go check upon Feng Xun and Xuan Yi.

161
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,320
You just stay here and don't walk away.

162
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:23,400
OK.

163
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:34,600
I must protect the Celestial Fruit well

164
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,120
to make His Highness Jun rest assured.

165
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:08,600
It is boring.

166
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:09,760
Let me put it to an end.

167
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:33,960
Hand over Feng Xiaowu.

168
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,440
Then I will let you go.

169
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:36,560
Who can expect that

170
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:39,040
you, Jun Linyuan seem to be a righteous,

171
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,640
but are a shameless and base man indeed.

172
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:42,800
A person like you

173
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:43,920
has no right to say our Darknight Court

174
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,080
is heterodox and evil.

175
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:46,800
What did you mean by saying that?

176
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,280
Do you want to deny it?

177
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,680
Feng Xiaowu has told me everything.

178
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,000
My home is near the border.

179
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:34,840
I was taken to the Frozen Forest
by Jun Linyuan suddenly.

180
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,920
He said that I would be a tribute

181
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,960
to the Firecloud Giant Hawk.

182
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:42,160
Then he could seize
the Celestial Fruit awaiting a chance.

183
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:48,160
One of the 36 stratagems, murdering
a person with a borrowed knife.

184
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:55,160
I got lucky.

185
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:59,760
I secured my chastity
disguising myself as an ugly girl.

186
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,480
But they

187
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:08,480
still gave me a hard time all the way.

188
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:11,800
Heroic Sir,

189
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,400
I can see
you have extraordinary spirit energy

190
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,400
and are handsome uncommonly.

191
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:20,280
You are way better than Jun Linyuan.

192
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:23,480
I am willing to mix myself inside them

193
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:26,600
to seize the Celestial Fruit for you
to repay your kindness.

194
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:29,200
By then, you will only need
to wait for me by the lake.

195
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:32,240
Jun Linyuan will lose the Celestial Fruit.

196
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:35,360
So you will be able to dampen his spirits

197
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:40,720
to avenge poor people like me.

198
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:42,640
OK.

199
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:43,960
Stop crying.

200
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:46,840
You go seize the Celestial Fruit.

201
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:50,280
And I will deal with Jun Linyuan.

202
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,040
Nonsense!

203
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:01,800
What?

204
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:04,280
You want to deny it now?

205
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,080
Then what is

206
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:10,600
this letter about?

207
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,120
Bloody hell!

208
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:30,120
The young master of the Darknight Court

209
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:31,560
is so gullible.

210
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,680
It is unexpected that I also...

211
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,400
Come to have a look!

212
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,960
A tender-hearted person tends
to be hurt by a heartless person.

213
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:50,920
Anyway, such an end is not bad.

214
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:53,520
Farewell, Jun Linyuan.

215
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,120
You helped me a lot by taking me out.

216
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,680
Thank you, Colored Phoenix!

217
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,400
Bye-bye, Jun Linyuan.

218
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:04,280
Mu Yao.

219
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:05,760
Mu Yao.

220
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:11,480
Under the current circumstance,

221
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,520
we mustn't go back like this.

222
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:16,800
But we are acting under the pretext
of patrolling the border.

223
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,200
If we check into an inn rashly,

224
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:20,000
we will arouse
the others' suspicion for sure.

225
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,080
That person of yours

226
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:25,640
is in the Border City now, right?

227
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,120
We can ask her for help.

228
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:28,040
Who?

229
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:30,920
His fiancée

230
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:32,120
Feng Wu.

231
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:41,800
I will entrust you with it, Old Man Ba.

232
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:44,720
It is my pleasure.

233
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,040
I am also

234
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,080
looking forward to

235
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:55,200
making such high-class medicinal pills.

236
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:13,680
Go.

237
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:27,240
It takes quite a while
to make the medicinal pills.

238
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:30,680
You have to wait for three days
and three nights.

239
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,200
On the fourth day,

240
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:33,920
you can come to take the pill.

241
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:36,880
Then you can resume cultivation.

242
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:43,680
OK.

243
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:47,960
OK.

244
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:49,600
I will wait patiently.

245
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:51,000
Tell me.

246
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:52,000
What do you want to eat?

247
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:53,520
I won't say

248
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,360
what I want to eat for the time being.

249
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,280
Just now,

250
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:00,400
I saw that you were ill at ease.

251
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,160
What is the matter?

252
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:02,320
Is there anything disturbing on your mind?

253
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:05,680
I have found the Celestial Fruit.

254
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:07,120
I have nothing disturbing on my mind.

255
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:10,840
I heard that His Highness Jun
also went to the Frozen Forest.

256
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:13,080
Did you see him?

257
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:14,320
Yes, I did.

258
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:15,720
What happened after that?

259
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:19,160
After that?

260
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:20,720
Nothing happened after that.

261
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:23,560
Just like that.

262
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:29,880
His Highness Jun

263
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:33,920
is famous for being good-looking
across Qianyuan Continent.

264
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:35,840
Was your love for him rekindled

265
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,960
after you saw him?

266
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,560
He put on a poker face all along.

267
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:42,800
How could I fall for him again?

268
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:46,400
You just never say uncle.

269
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:49,000
You lass,

270
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:50,600
about what is on your mind,

271
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,920
I am very clear.

272
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,720
Back then,

273
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:00,240
back then, I am also...

274
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,440
Cut it out!

275
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:04,240
The stories

276
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:05,560
about you and the village woman Wang,

277
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:07,000
and back alley lady Shen

278
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,960
are stale news to me.

279
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:11,040
Give it to me.

280
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:12,560
Listen up.

281
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,560
You can't find excuses to deny it

282
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:17,160
when something happens to you.

283
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:20,840
There is always a reason
for you to fall for someone.

284
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:25,160
You must follow your heart.

285
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:26,440
Have you got it?

286
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:28,200
Yes, I got it,

287
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:30,520
Love Expert Ba.

288
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,960
Upon my return this time, I didn't go home.

289
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:36,000
So I am dirty from head to toe.

290
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:37,800
I will stop chatting with you.

291
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:38,720
I will go back home.

292
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,400
OK. Hurry to go.

293
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:42,040
Your mom has been waiting for you.

294
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:46,280
Three days later, I will come to fetch
the Nine Transformation Spirit Restoration pill.

295
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,360
By then, I will bring you a jug of good wine

296
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:49,640
and cook a dish to go with the wine.

297
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:50,960
OK. That's good.

298
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,480
Then I will go on telling
the story of Wu Song.

299
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:54,640
Will that make you very happy?

300
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:56,120
Yes, I will be happy.

301
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:57,400
I am looking forward to that.

302
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,120
How come this lass

303
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:04,040
knows so many stories?

304
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:23,800
I heard that the Border City
also got into trouble.

305
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:24,920
Luckily, His Highness Jun

306
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,480
and Goddess Zuo
of the Celestial Palace gave a hand.

307
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:27,800
Thus, a disaster was avoided.

308
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:28,720
Which is stronger,

309
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:30,440
the Firecloud Giant Hawk

310
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:31,560
or the Hundred Poison Beast here?

311
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,400
It is lucky that Goddess Zuo
has arrived in time.

312
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:34,800
Otherwise, we would
have got into great trouble.

313
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:38,120
Goddess Zuo?

314
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:48,340
(Zhao Ge, daughter of the leader
of the Celestial Palace)

315
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,720
Boss Jun, the Border City is just ahead.

316
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:01,640
It won't be long

317
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:03,160
before we meet Feng Wu.

318
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:05,320
Is it really that exciting?

319
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:08,000
Feng Wu is a good-for-nothing now.

320
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,720
How can she still find favor
with His Highness Jun?

321
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,760
Zuo Qingluan,
your senior sister is quite something.

322
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:14,000
But she doesn't seem
to be in favor with Boss Jun, either.

323
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:14,720
How could you?

324
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,440
Boss Jun, what should we do now?

325
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:19,600
We are strangers here.

326
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:21,440
It is extremely difficult for us
to find someone here.

327
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:24,200
Let's go to the Feng family first.

328
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:25,600
After talking so much,

329
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:26,840
you still want to see her.

330
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:35,160
It is from my Senior Sister.

331
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:42,040
She asked me to help her eradicate
the Hundred Poison Beast in Jingzhou.

332
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,680
So I won't go to the Border City with you.

333
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:45,520
Great!

334
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:48,480
Now the Celestial Fruit

335
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,360
is in the possession
of an unidentified ugly girl.

336
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:52,320
It is not the time for you to feel happy.

337
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:55,480
Your Highness Jun, I am sorry.

338
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:56,640
I gotta go now.

339
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:57,440
Just go.

340
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:03,280
We should also quicken our pace.

341
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:10,760
Come to have a look!

342
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:13,320
It is the superior-quality crock.

343
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:41,040
What is going on?

344
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:57,960
Report to you, Eldest Young Master.

345
00:29:58,560 --> 00:29:59,720
We have searched every room,

346
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:00,760
but failed to find it.

347
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,080
Young Master, it is not found.

348
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,440
Young Master, I didn't find it.

349
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,480
A group of disabled men!

350
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:08,720
Go on searching for it.

351
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:09,800
Yes, sir!

352
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:23,400
Aunt.

353
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:24,960
Where is it exactly?

354
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:26,480
Stop hiding it.

355
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:28,160
Please give it to my elder brother.

356
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:29,800
She is Feng Liu?

357
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:32,720
They are putting on airs in our home.

358
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:34,440
How could she be so cheeky
to call my mom aunt?

359
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:37,560
Could her elder brother be

360
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:40,960
my cousin Feng Yiran

361
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:42,840
mentioned by Qiu Ling?

362
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:45,520
Since my husband passed away,

363
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,080
the Phoenix Sword has been missing.

364
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,520
Now I really don't know

365
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:52,760
where the sword is.

366
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:54,440
I am afraid you have found the wrong person.

367
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:56,080
We still call you aunt

368
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:58,280
for old times' sake.

369
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:01,120
If you insist saying so,

370
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:03,920
you will make us lose face.

371
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:06,000
Miss Feng Liu,

372
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:07,480
our madam has said that she doesn't know.

373
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,080
Please stop forcing her.

374
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,440
You are just a servant girl.

375
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:12,280
This is none of your business.

376
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,240
If you dare say one more word,

377
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:16,360
I will rip up your mouth!

378
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:17,560
-How dare you!
-Qiu Ling!

379
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:22,920
The Phoenix Sword is the carry-on weapon
of the Feng family's master.

380
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:25,480
Since the former master passed away,

381
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,600
the Phoenix Sword has been in dormancy
in the old family residence.

382
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:31,000
Now it is time for it to show itself again.

383
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:34,760
If I find out you are hiding it purposefully,

384
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:37,000
I will not let you off.

385
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:42,960
Since my daughter
and I were exiled to this place,

386
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
our only wish has been to live an easy life.

387
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:48,760
We really know nothing

388
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:50,640
about the whereabouts of the Phoenix Sword.

389
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:52,840
As for taking the reins of the Feng family,

390
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:55,960
we are not interested at all.

391
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:03,000
Where is the useless girl Feng Wu?

392
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:04,920
Why hasn't she come out?

393
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:07,280
She has gone to gather herbs in the mountain.

394
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:08,960
She won't be back soon.

395
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:12,440
No wonder back then,

396
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:14,920
you agreed so readily to come back
to the old family residence.

397
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,160
You just counted the days

398
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:18,080
to wait for the Phoenix Sword
to appear again.

399
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,360
Good for you!

400
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:22,040
You are so calculating.

401
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:31,520
You are really ill-mannered.

402
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:33,320
I have been here for so long.

403
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:34,880
You didn't even serve me a cup of tea.

404
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:36,840
It is because you withheld our stipends.

405
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,920
If our young lady hadn't gathered herbs
to support the family,

406
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,520
we would have been unable to feed ourselves.

407
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:42,960
Stop standing there mumbling.

408
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:44,520
Hurry up

409
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:45,720
fetch some tea for us.

410
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:55,320
Those bad people!

411
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:57,200
How could they come to

412
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,800
insult my beautiful mom while I was away?

413
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:14,040
My Lord.

414
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:17,040
Have you completed the mission as I ordered?

415
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,000
I am incompetent

416
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:20,400
and failed to get the Celestial Fruit.

417
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:22,120
Please punish me, My Lord.

418
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:33,760
Has Jun Linyuan got it?

419
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:35,920
I didn't get it,

420
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:37,680
neither did Jun Linyuan.

421
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:38,960
I have got some clues.

422
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:40,400
I will keep tracking it down.

423
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:42,160
Try to get it as soon as possible.

424
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:45,560
We can't allow Jun Linyuan to get it.

425
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:48,680
Or we will be
in a more unfavorable position later.

426
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:49,960
Yes, My Lord!

427
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:51,320
I will set out right now.

428
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:53,040
I will definitely get the Celestial Fruit.

429
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:07,480
Qiu Ling.

430
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:12,480
My Lady, you are back.

431
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:14,040
When are you back?

432
00:34:15,150 --> 00:34:16,150
I have no time to explain it to you.

433
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:20,560
Come, come with me.

434
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:24,670
Where else can the Phoenix Sword be hidden?

435
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:26,150
Tell us

436
00:34:26,710 --> 00:34:29,630
whether there are hidden tunnels
or mechanisms here.

437
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:31,760
If there were any,

438
00:34:32,230 --> 00:34:33,960
you would have found them

439
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:35,880
since you have left no stone unturned.

440
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:39,000
That makes sense.

441
00:35:03,630 --> 00:35:04,680
Please have some tea.

442
00:35:07,220 --> 00:35:07,700
It's hot.

443
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:09,480
-I am sorry!
-Are you crazy?

444
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:12,760
What are you doing?

445
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,600
Cousin.

446
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:18,920
I am too excited to see you.

447
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:20,280
So I...

448
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:23,400
Feng Wu?

449
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,720
So you are Feng Wu.

450
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:31,280
I have been away from home
for cultivation since childhood.

451
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:33,320
When I saw you last time,
we were still children.

452
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:35,480
Feng Wu,

453
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:37,880
you have grown into such a beautiful lady.

454
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:39,720
Cousin,

455
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:42,240
many years have passed since we met.

456
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:43,800
It is unexpected that

457
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:45,960
you have grown into an impressive man.

458
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:47,520
You must have become

459
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:50,040
a medium-rank spiritual practitioner, right?

460
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:54,040
I respected you a lot.

461
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:57,360
It is good for you to say this, Feng Wu.

462
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:59,400
After I get the Phoenix Sword,

463
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:00,240
I will be

464
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:02,760
the justifiable successor of our Feng family.

465
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:05,560
By then, you can accompany me
back to the capital

466
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:06,320
to enjoy a well-off life.

467
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:07,200
Elder brother.

468
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,160
Speaking of the Phoenix Sword...

469
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:12,400
Do you know something about it?

470
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:15,160
Yes. I seem to have a vague impression of it.

471
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:17,640
When we arrived
in the old residence back then,

472
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:19,320
a steward ever mentioned it.

473
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:20,160
Where is it?

474
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:22,040
I don't know

475
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:23,040
where it is.

476
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:25,280
Let me think about it.

477
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:27,760
It seems to be...

478
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:31,040
to be...

479
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:33,560
Elder brother, don't listen to her.

480
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:35,320
-She must be mystifying you.
-Where is it?

481
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:36,200
Shut up!

482
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:40,240
I recalled where it is now.

483
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,160
It is in one of the flowerbeds

484
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:44,080
of this old residence.

485
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:46,440
Flowerbed?

486
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:51,480
But I can't remember

487
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:52,800
which flowerbed it is in exactly?

488
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:54,320
The steward didn't say.

489
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:55,480
Thank you so much, Feng Wu.

490
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:57,400
I will bear your kindness in mind.

491
00:36:58,480 --> 00:36:59,280
Attendants!

492
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:08,480
Go dig up all the flowerbeds

493
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:09,720
of this residence.

494
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:10,680
Yes, sir!

495
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:12,920
My Lady, is the Phoenix Sword

496
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:14,320
really in the flowerbed?

497
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:16,120
How should I know?

498
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:17,920
There are dozens of flowerbeds

499
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,280
in this old residence.

500
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:22,440
It will take them quite a while
to search all of them.

501
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:34,840
Landlady.

502
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:36,560
Mr. Bi.

503
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:37,680
Come in, please.

504
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:40,000
You are still a charming, landlady.

505
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:41,640
You flattered me, Mr. Bi.

506
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:43,200
Have a drink with me, landlady.

507
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:44,800
Mr. Bi, I can't drink.

508
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,680
I am an honored guest, right?

509
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,040
-Mr. Bi.
-You should drink a cup with me.

510
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:49,800
Mr. Bi, I will go fetch the wine for you.

511
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:52,240
Mr. Bi, don't do this.

512
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:54,680
Who hit me?

513
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:56,280
Who?

514
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:07,440
Go beat him, you two.

515
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:08,480
Yes, sir.

516
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:18,600
We are leaving.

517
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:19,480
Go. Go.

518
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:20,280
Wait up.

519
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:33,400
There has been
and is no bad blood between us.

520
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:35,640
Why did you sabotage my affair?

521
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:38,960
It is said that

522
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:42,240
spiritual practitioners
don't bully commoners, right?

523
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:44,320
Can you be called a commoner?

524
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:48,880
My gosh!

525
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:52,480
Which part of my body got hit?

526
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:07,840
Do you know this person?

527
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:09,640
Well,

528
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,240
