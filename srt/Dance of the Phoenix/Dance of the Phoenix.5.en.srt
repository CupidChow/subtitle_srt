=Dance of the Phoenix=

2
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:40,580
(Episode 5)

3
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,040
Do you know this person?

4
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,040
Well,

5
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:52,480
she looks kind of familiar.

6
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,360
But I don't think I know her.

7
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:55,880
Think it over.

8
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,480
Think it over?

9
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,040
I don't know her.

10
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,680
Buy me 300 candied hawthorns later.

11
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,640
I'll use them to beat people.

12
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:23,480
Let's go.

13
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,040
Your Highness,

14
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,080
Young Master Feng,

15
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,120
Young Master Xuan Yi,

16
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,400
you must be tired after a long trip.

17
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,280
Lord Bi, sorry to let you wait.

18
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,240
It's okay.

19
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,640
I rushed here

20
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:37,680
right after I heard the news.

21
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,000
I've prepared a meal

22
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,800
to welcome all of you.

23
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:41,840
Please.

24
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:42,640
Don't bother.

25
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:43,600
Lord Bi,

26
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,640
you've been in charge
of the Border City for decades.

27
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:46,920
You must know very well

28
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,640
about the city.

29
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,520
Kind of.

30
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:51,960
We won't eat here,

31
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,160
but we do need you to do us a favor.

32
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:55,840
Sure. Sure.

33
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,600
How can I help you then?

34
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,200
She is...?

35
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,560
My Lady, are you alright?

36
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:13,520
I'm fine.

37
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:18,000
Why does this Feng Yiran

38
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,520
have to come now?

39
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:22,200
He's here to find Phoenix Sword?

40
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,120
Or, did he find out

41
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,320
that I'd been secretly refining

42
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,280
Nine Transformation Spirit Restoration Pill?

43
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,400
It's impossible.

44
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,600
Old Man Ba is a trustworthy person.

45
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,800
He wouldn't have given me away.

46
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:37,760
It's true, My Lady.

47
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,720
They've searched the house for a whole day.

48
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,320
The house has been turned upside down,

49
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:42,920
but they still didn't find anything.

50
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:43,880
No.

51
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:47,000
I have to find something for him to do,

52
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:48,080
so that

53
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,920
he won't come bother us.

54
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,400
Where is

55
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:56,520
the Phoenix Sword hidden?

56
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:21,400
Cousin.

57
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,560
We've searched so long,
yet there's still no sign of the Sword.

58
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:25,680
Are you sure it's the right place?

59
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Of course, I am.

60
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,480
I remember it very clearly.

61
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,200
It should be in this flower bed.

62
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:32,720
Oh, right.

63
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:36,160
The one who was in charge left a poem then,

64
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:39,040
which is supposed to be the key
to solving the mystery.

65
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,080
Poem?

66
00:04:58,880 --> 00:04:59,640
Cousin,

67
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,120
you can't read it?

68
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:03,920
Nonsense.

69
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,640
Of course, I can.

70
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:20,480
H He Li Be B.

71
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,120
C N O F Ne.

72
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,520
Na Mg Al Si P.

73
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,480
S Cl Ar K Ca.

74
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,640
Is it a nice poem or not?

75
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:28,480
It sounds really

76
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,280
like a nice poem.

77
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:32,560
Cousin.

78
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:35,080
Look at font of the characters.
It looks like a spell.

79
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:38,440
And the structure of it
actually follows a rule.

80
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:42,800
It sends out a sense of mystery, doesn't it?

81
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,120
What you said

82
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:46,240
does make sense.

83
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:58,360
Unfortunately, I'm too dumb

84
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,240
to help you solve the problem.

85
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,240
But,

86
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,800
since you are so smart,

87
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,680
I'm sure you can solve it by your own.

88
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,160
Thank you, cousin.

89
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,280
I will study this poem

90
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:13,400
and get the Phoenix Sword
as soon as possible.

91
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:21,280
My Lady.

92
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,240
What did you write?

93
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,920
How come I don't understand it, either?

94
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,560
How would I know?

95
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,560
I just wrote it randomly.

96
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:33,720
So the Celestial Fruit is
nowhere to be found?

97
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:34,440
It's not.

98
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:36,640
His Highness has returned to the Border City

99
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:37,840
to get more information.

100
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,840
He said

101
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:42,280
he'd also visit the Feng family.

102
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,280
The Feng family?

103
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,240
Well,

104
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:49,560
I forgot

105
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:50,840
that she was there, too.

106
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:52,480
Senior Sister,

107
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:55,200
now that we've solved the problem
of the Hundred Poison Beast,

108
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,560
the most important thing right now

109
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,880
is to protect His Highness
from being taken away.

110
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,440
We should head to the Border City
as soon as possible.

111
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,240
Zhao Ge may still be in Jingzhou.

112
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,960
Let's find her first.

113
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,400
Senior Sister.

114
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:15,240
I heard the Feng family of the capital
also sent people to the Border City.

115
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,440
Please write a letter to Feng Liu

116
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,760
and ask her to keep an eye on it.

117
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,320
Okay, Senior Sister.

118
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,600
Zhao Ge,

119
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,800
where are you?

120
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,680
I didn't expect it'd be such a huge place.

121
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:45,320
Sorry that I failed in

122
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,560
welcoming you, Your Highness.

123
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,680
Am I dreaming?

124
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,880
His Highness is here to see me.

125
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:57,920
Greetings to you, Your Highness.

126
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,320
She's my sister.

127
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:00,520
She...

128
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:02,960
She is Feng Wu?

129
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:03,800
No.

130
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:04,800
She is my sixth sister.

131
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:05,920
Her name is Feng Liu.

132
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,120
I was startled.

133
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:11,000
I thought Feng Wu's face was distorted.

134
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,000
It's good that she's not her.

135
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:17,120
What are they doing here in Feng's Mansion?

136
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:20,760
Have they found out
that I am actually Feng Xiaowu?

137
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,680
Your Highness, please come in.

138
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,280
I'd better leave here soon.

139
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:40,320
Let's go.

163

Men and women
should avoid touching each other.

164
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:13,280
My Lady.

165
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:18,040
Have we met somewhere before?

166
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:20,640
Young Master, you must be kidding.

167
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,680
I'm just a low-class maid.

168
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,200
How could you possibly meet me before?

169
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:27,760
I think I just have an average face.

170
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,080
I've been staying in my room all the time.

171
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,560
It's not proper for me to meet guests.

172
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:34,000
I'll take my leave now.

173
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:35,400
Come on.

174
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:36,880
Just forget about the formality

175
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,400
and stop being so humble.

176
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:39,760
It's quite annoying.

177
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,320
I can't believe

178
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,320
that time can make so many things change.

179
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:53,520
Let's go.

180
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,400
There's no point to stay here.

181
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,400
Boss Jun, aren't you leaving?

182
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,040
With Feng Wu's situation,

183
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,720
I don't think she can help us.

184
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:14,360
Your Highness,

185
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,560
you just arrived in the Border City.

186
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,040
Let me give you a tour, okay?

187
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:17,760
No need.

188
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,040
Your...

189
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:21,720
Brother.

190
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:22,720
It's all Feng Wu's fault.

191
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,240
She scared everybody away.

192
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:28,020
Candied hawthorns.

193
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:32,620
Fresh candied hawthorns.

194
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:37,120
Say,

195
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,920
how come Feng Wu has become like this?

196
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,040
So boring.

197
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:41,880
Maybe she has

198
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:43,360
some unspeakable reasons.

199
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,000
Such as?

200
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,640
After all, she has lost her cultivation base.

201
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:48,800
Maybe

202
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,680
a life like this

203
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:51,560
is the best for her.

204
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,360
So what should we do now?

205
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:57,360
Shall we just wait for Lord Bi's report?

206
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,440
Let's search

207
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,040
for some other clues in secret.

208
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:06,320
Did Fifth Young Lady really keep

209
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,840
the medicated wine you made?

210
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:09,560
Yes.

211
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:11,880
And she also praised me for my skills.

212
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:13,120
Really?

213
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,640
But it's quite strange

214
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,200
that Fifth Young Lady hasn't

215
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,000
come for checkup for a long time.

216
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,840
I wonder what happened.

217
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,080
You don't know?

218
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,760
It's said that she's got

219
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,240
a bunch of visitors from her clan.

220
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,600
No outsiders are allowed to get in.

221
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,160
That serious?

222
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,480
Yes.

223
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:30,800
I heard there were two visitors
from the capital.

224
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,720
People call them Young Master
and Sixth Young Lady.

225
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,280
They are not only staying
in Fifth Young Lady's house,

226
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,680
but also quite overbearing.

227
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,760
They look very intimidating.

228
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:41,720
I'm worried that they'd
bully Fifth Young Lady.

229
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:44,560
Ma'am.

230
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,800
Is the Fifth Young Lady
you were talking about

231
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:47,720
Feng Wu?

232
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,200
I only know Fifth Young Lady.

233
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:52,800
I've never heard of Feng Wu.

234
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,480
She's the one who lives in an old mansion
in the suburb,

235
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,560
and she's nothing but a pretty face.

236
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,160
That's Fifth Young Lady's place.

237
00:13:58,520 --> 00:13:59,640
What do you mean?

238
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:01,120
Why did you say
that Fifth Young Lady was nothing?

239
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,320
She's quite amazing.

240
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,200
I'm just telling the truth.

241
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,120
Feng Wu is like a log now,

242
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,840
dull and boring.

243
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:08,720
Feng Xun.

244
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,680
I have something to ask.

245
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,600
Who can tell me

246
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:21,080
who's the most famous Elixir Refiner

247
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,560
in the northern Border City?

248
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,120
Old Man Ba. Old Man Ba.

249
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,560
You crazy lass.

250
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:29,560
What's with the rush?

251
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:31,160
How is the Nine Transformation
Spirit Restoration Pill coming?

252
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,360
I've told you how long it'd take.

253
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:36,000
Stop pushing me.

254
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,200
I can't wait anymore.

255
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,800
Jun Linyuan has come to find me.

256
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,400
Didn't you disguise yourself?

257
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:42,160
Have they found out

258
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,800
that you took the Celestial Fruit?

259
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:44,880
Not yet.

260
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:46,560
But they will know it sooner or later

261
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,080
if it goes on like this.

262
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:49,760
It took me so long

263
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,240
to finally get the Celestial Fruit.

264
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,840
I can't let them take it away from me.

265
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:53,240
Well...

266
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,000
Is anybody here?

267
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,040
Well...

268
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,160
Feng Wu?

269
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,800
You must be curious

270
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,920
about why I'm here.

271
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:18,040
And you must be curious

272
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,360
about why

273
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,800
I disguised myself like that.

274
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,840
I can explain.

275
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:27,160
Tell us.

276
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:32,680
You know

277
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:36,520
that my mom and I only have each other.

278
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:41,760
The Feng family didn't give us

279
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:44,040
any food or clothes.

280
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:49,600
We were so poor and had no way to survive.

281
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:51,920
Is that true?

282
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:57,080
Yes, it is.

283
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,480
It's all truth.

284
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:04,040
Thanks to Master Ba, he taught me

285
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,920
his excellent medical skills
so that I could make a living.

286
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,160
Wu

287
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,760
is such a pitiful girl.

288
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:15,360
Poor girl.

289
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,600
I see.

290
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:22,080
If I hadn't pretended to be slow,

291
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:26,200
who knows what the Feng family
would have done to me?

292
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,520
Don't cry.

293
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,360
You don't look pretty anymore when you cry.

294
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:36,880
Stop crying.

295
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,800
It'll make you look ugly.

296
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:40,600
Don't cry.

297
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:43,080
What are you doing here?

298
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,560
We knew you were here.

299
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,040
So we came to bring you back.

300
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:51,680
Bring me back?

301
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:52,640
Yes.

302
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:55,280
We'll stay at the Feng's Mansion tonight.

303
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:56,360
What do you say?

304
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:58,040
You'll let us, right?

305
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,560
Of course.

306
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:09,080
Ma'am.

307
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,880
Have you met this girl before?

308
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:13,590
No.

309
00:17:14,350 --> 00:17:16,000
Why don't you ask the beggars over there?

310
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,350
They've seen a lot of people.

311
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:25,070
What are you doing? I can't see.

312
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:26,310
I won.

313
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,160
Could you help me find a person?

314
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,360
Sure.

315
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,480
My Lady said

316
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,600
the mansion was a little small.

317
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:53,840
Your Highness,

318
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:55,480
you can check it out first

319
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:57,280
before you decide if you wanna stay.

320
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:06,520
Brother, what's going on?

321
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,720
Why is His Highness back?

322
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,360
He will stay in our mansion.

323
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:12,320
Go make the arrangement

324
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:13,440
and take good care of him.

325
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:18,480
Your Highness, Young Master Feng,
Young Master Xuan Yi,

326
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:19,840
our mansion is quite shabby.

327
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:21,440
Sorry for the inconvenience.

328
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:22,760
Please forgive us.

329
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:25,240
It's located in the southeast corner,

330
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:26,760
and close to the other residents.

331
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,240
If anything should happen,

332
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,280
a simple shout can get
the patrol's attention.

333
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:31,360
Not bad.

334
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:32,480
Yes.

335
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:35,440
The air flow

336
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:36,960
is quite smooth here.

337
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,000
It is airy.

338
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:39,560
Nice.

339
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:41,680
Let me know

340
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,200
if there's anything else you need.

341
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:44,800
Your Highness,

342
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:47,200
living under the same roof with you

343
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,400
is like a dream to me.

344
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:51,360
I hope...

345
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:53,880
I hope you can stay a few more days.

346
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:55,400
I...

347
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:57,360
Let's go.

348
00:18:58,280 --> 00:18:59,160
Come on.

349
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,680
Is this how your Feng family
entertains the guests?

350
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,200
Qiu Ling,

351
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,280
you did this on purpose.

352
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:30,320
There are many other guest rooms
in this mansion.

353
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:32,320
Why did you pick this one for His Highness?

354
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:32,840
What you did

355
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:34,520
really embarrasses the Feng family.

356
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:37,280
I do have my reasons.

357
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:39,640
This mansion has been abandoned for years.

358
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:42,520
It was even shabbier when My Lady

359
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:43,880
and My Madam first came here three years ago.

360
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:45,240
Besides,

361
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:47,480
the money sent here every month

362
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:49,120
isn't even enough for food,

363
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:52,320
let alone buying new things
or remolding the house.

364
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:54,880
The Feng family is
a time-honored cultivation family.

365
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,120
How can such a big family

366
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,520
mistreat its clansmen like this?

367
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:01,240
I...

368
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:04,800
My Lady really appreciates

369
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,600
the Feng family for their support.

370
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,520
It doesn't matter

371
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:09,520
even if she starves often.

372
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,000
We always treat our clansmen nicely

373
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,280
when they visit.

374
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,160
I just don't know

375
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:17,160
if the Feng family sees us as family.

376
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,120
The Feng family certainly
sees you guys as family.

377
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:21,240
Dad sent me over this time

378
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,800
to bring you some money actually.

379
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,680
I was going to give it to my aunt in person,

380
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:26,560
but I've been so busy recently, so...

381
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:28,560
It's so kind of you.

382
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:30,040
I knew it.

383
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:31,640
-Please calm down.
-Master Feng is a fair person.

384
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,920
He wouldn't abandon My Lady and My Madam.

385
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,960
The servants must have
made some mistakes before

386
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:37,840
and forgotten to send the money.

387
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,240
Yes.

388
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:41,280
You are right.

389
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:42,560
Then that's good.

390
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:44,200
If anything happens again, My Lady can go

391
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:46,920
to the capital and complain it
to Young Master Feng.

392
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,040
I'm sure you will teach
those people a lesson.

393
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:53,800
Me?

394
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:55,720
I heard that Young Master Feng

395
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:57,360
was warm-hearted and willing to help people.

396
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:01,720
That's right.

397
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:02,560
Just come to me.

398
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:03,360
It's no big deal.

399
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:04,760
We even slept in the wild once.

400
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,280
As long as there are no rats.

401
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,120
I'm really afraid of rats.

402
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:09,440
It's okay.

403
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:13,720
Let's just stay here.

404
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:18,340
(Feng's Mansion)

405
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:29,080
Don't you think Feng Wu is a little weird?

406
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:32,760
What do you mean?

407
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:35,400
It feels like

408
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,760
she's hiding something from us.

409
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,800
After all, we haven't met her for years.

410
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:42,720
Who knows what kinda person she's become?

411
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:51,480
You must be hungry

412
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:52,640
after a long day.

413
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:54,120
I cooked for you today.

414
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:55,160
Would you

415
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:56,280
like to try my cooking?

416
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:01,520
Sure.

417
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:09,960
Kung Pao prawns.

418
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,040
Sauteed vermicelli with minced pork.

419
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,360
Sliced Beef in Chili Oil.

420
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:13,680
Pan-seared green chili pepper.

421
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:14,720
What do you think?

422
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:15,800
Not bad, huh?

423
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:20,320
Thanks to His Highness's visit,

424
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:22,960
my cousin has given me a lot of money.

425
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:24,960
What a simple meal.

426
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:27,200
It's alright.

427
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:27,960
Let's eat.

428
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,800
Smells so good.

429
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,000
Qiu Ling, it's so tasty.

430
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:54,760
Boss Jun,

431
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:56,760
I know you've got used to a wealthy life

432
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,080
in your Junwu Divine Hall.

433
00:22:58,440 --> 00:22:59,880
But we don't expect anything fancy.

434
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:02,120
After all, we've traveled a long way
from the Frozen Forest.

435
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:03,360
I'm really starving.

436
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:19,720
How is it?

437
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:20,960
How does it taste?

438
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:22,880
Not good.

439
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:23,760
Not good at all.

440
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:33,080
Qiu Ling, it's so yummy.

441
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:39,600
Your Highness,

442
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:41,960
would you like to try?

443
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:44,800
Save your energy.

444
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:48,480
Only Xuan Yi and I can bear your cooking.

445
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:51,960
Asking him to eat this
will actually offend him.

446
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:19,280
Help me to put it on.

447
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:34,640
Turn around.

448
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:57,520
My hair.

449
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:35,040
It's so-so.

450
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:41,240
The food is a nice diversion.

451
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:42,400
My plan works.

452
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,360
Feng Wu,

453
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:46,360
your cooking is amazing.

454
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:48,160
I want to eat it every single day.

455
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:49,560
I wouldn't mind eating it for my whole life.

456
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:51,800
Boss Jun,

457
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:54,400
how about let's stay here

458
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,360
till we leave the Border City?

459
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:57,040
Feng Wu, you won't mind, right?

460
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:04,520
Who said I wouldn't mind?

461
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:05,680
Of course, I do.

462
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:10,400
And I think the way that Feng Xiaowu speaks

463
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:12,720
is quite like Feng Wu.

464
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,920
Maybe she's a local.

465
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:18,080
We should have a place to stay

466
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,640
while looking for her anyway.

467
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,360
Feng Xiaowu?

468
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:23,520
Who's Feng Xiaowu?

469
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:24,920
Just a scammer,

470
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:25,920
who stole our stuff.

471
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:27,240
We are looking for her.

472
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:30,240
Though the Border City isn't huge,

473
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:31,920
it's not small either.

474
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:33,880
So it isn't easy to find someone

475
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,080
in a city like this.

476
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:36,960
Also,

477
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:38,400
how do you know

478
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:39,760
she's a local?

479
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:42,320
What if she's not a local?

480
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:43,680
Boss Jun,

481
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:45,680
what do you say?

482
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:48,400
Alright.

483
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:50,280
Let's stay here.

484
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:05,600
Who is it?

485
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:10,200
Who's here this late?

486
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:15,240
Can't you wait till tomorrow

487
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:19,080
instead of knocking on the door
in the middle of night?

488
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:23,480
Unbelievable.

489
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:24,800
Coming.

490
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:30,200
You are...

491
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:33,720
I'm Young Master Feng

492
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:35,680
for God's sake.

493
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:37,640
Why should I prepare bed for you guys?

494
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:39,560
I'd be so embarrassed
if people knew about this.

495
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:49,800
Xuan Yi.

496
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:52,960
Xuan Yi.

497
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:56,440
What's up?

498
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,080
Don't you think

499
00:27:58,480 --> 00:27:59,680
Boss Jun is quite

500
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:00,880
strange today?

501
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:07,600
How so?

502
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,200
He didn't get angry.

503
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:11,000
Look.

504
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:12,400
We've traveled this far

505
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,760
from the capital

506
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:14,880
just for that

507
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:18,080
Celestial Fruit.

508
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,120
Now that it's lost

509
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:21,480
and the clue is gone,

510
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,240
he doesn't seem to mind at all.

511
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:25,520
Don't you find that strange?

512
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:28,120
It's...

513
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:29,760
It's not strange?

514
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:30,920
It's really strange, okay?

515
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:31,960
And

516
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:33,400
he was actually lost in thought.

517
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:36,160
His mind is actually capable
of wandering off.

518
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:37,360
I think

519
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:39,720
that Feng Xiaowu did this to you.

520
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,640
You're suspicious of everything now.

521
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:42,440
But I...

522
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:43,560
Stop it.

523
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:44,960
Just continue to prepare the bed.

524
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:46,080
I mean...

525
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:48,040
We still need to go get
more information tomorrow.

526
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:48,680
But... but... but...

527
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:51,160
We've got to find that ugly girl

528
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:52,440
before the power
of the Celestial Fruit is gone.

529
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:53,240
But...

530
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:54,800
It's an important issue.

531
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:55,960
I need you to be focused.

532
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:57,760
Forget it.

533
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:59,600
I can't get it through your thick head.

534
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:01,360
Focusing on Boss Jun is the same

535
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:03,160
as focusing on the Celestial Fruit.

536
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:04,480
I'll stop talking to you.

537
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:22,900
(Peaceful and Promising)

538
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:26,240
The bed is prepared.

539
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:27,800
Let's go to sleep.

540
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:31,800
Boss Jun,

541
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:32,920
what are you busy with?

542
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:36,880
Nothing.

543
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:42,400
So petty.

544
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,480
Xuan Yi, it's yours.

545
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:48,640
Boss Jun, it's yours.

546
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:02,280
You are afraid of rats, aren't you?

547
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:04,240
I'm just following My Lady's order.

548
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:07,400
Sorry, Young Master Feng.

549
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:09,800
What's this?

550
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:12,040
These are night gowns my mom made for us.

551
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:13,840
It's more comfortable sleeping in it.

552
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:16,420
(Powerful)

553
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:19,760
I'm asking

554
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:22,360
(Intelligent)
what's with this character?

555
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:23,720
Though I know

556
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:25,520
the word "Intelligent" flatters you too much,

557
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:28,680
(Handsome)
Boss Jun and I are both qualified for ours.

558
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:30,600
But we'll count you in anyway.

559
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:34,080
You are full of shit.

560
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:35,240
I'm not wearing it.

561
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:36,160
You...

562
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:39,880
I've just prepared bed for you.

563
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:42,080
How could you do this?

564
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:05,880
(Harmonious and Prosperous)

565
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:08,160
I didn't expect Feng Wu

566
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:09,280
to be so pretty

567
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:10,880
and a good cook as well.

568
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:12,360
Unfortunately,

569
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:14,120
the family conflict is too complicated.

570
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:15,560
That Feng Yiran

571
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:17,240
doesn't seem to be a good person.

572
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:19,400
It's such a waste

573
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:21,120
for him to practice cultivation.

574
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:23,160
Don't gossip about the Feng family

575
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:24,360
and defame them.

576
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:27,840
I'm just talking to you guys.

577
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:29,120
Boss Jun,

578
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:31,760
you are so lucky

579
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,280
to have a fiancée like her.

580
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:35,040
If I were you,

581
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:37,440
even if she didn't have any cultivation base,

582
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:39,560
I'd still marry and love her.

583
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:41,240
We should think about

584
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:43,520
how to find that ugly girl

585
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:45,000
and take the Celestial Fruit back.

586
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:47,480
It's so hard to see through people.

587
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:50,360
I can't believe she's
such a sophisticated girl.

588
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:52,480
But, somehow,

589
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:54,680
I don't think Xiaowu is that kinda person.

590
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:56,480
The fact is that she hid her identity

591
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:57,880
and stole our Celestial Fruit.

592
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:01,720
I just can't figure out

593
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:04,640
as an ordinary girl
who doesn't have any cultivation base,

594
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:07,000
why would she take such a big risk

595
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:08,240
to steal the Celestial Fruit.

596
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,600
Maybe somebody asked her to do that.

597
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:17,560
Maybe there's more to it,

598
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:19,000
and she is wronged.

599
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:20,720
Don't make a conclusion so soon.

600
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:44,200
Now, stop talking.

601
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,080
Alright.

602
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:51,880
Let's be nice to Feng Wu

603
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:53,840
while we are staying here.

604
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:56,240
In that case, I guess the Feng cousins

605
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:57,520
won't get too aggressive.

606
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,760
Though she exaggerated her situation,

607
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:03,080
I'm sure she's been bullied for a long time.

608
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:06,040
Got it.

609
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:08,800
Your Highness, you are cold outside
but warm inside.

610
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:10,720
Actually, you've been seeing her

611
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:13,240
as your fiancée, haven't you?

612
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,920
I just think she's familiar with this place.

613
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:17,560
We need her help

614
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:19,160
to find Feng Xiaowu.

615
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:11,080
Keep going.

616
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:28,710
King in Black.

617
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:31,520
You've tortured me for a whole night.

618
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:35,040
I really know nothing.

619
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:38,600
I'm just a poor old man who refines medicine.

620
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:40,400
I have nothing

621
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:42,120
but some good wine.

622
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:43,440
Yet you drank it all

623
00:34:43,630 --> 00:34:45,320
without even saving some for me.

624
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:46,630
I've asked many people in the city

625
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:48,120
before I came here.

626
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:55,600
Do you know Feng Xiaowu?

627
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:58,760
Someone said she

628
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:00,000
visited you some time ago.

629
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:05,760
I... I don't know her.

630
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:07,960
I've never met her before.

631
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:09,720
Think again.

632
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:12,360
Seriously. I haven't.

633
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:15,520
Maybe they made a mistake.

634
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:21,760
Has someone come to ask you to refine elixir

635
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:25,480
and given you something precious?

636
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:26,840
Something like

637
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:28,640
Celestial Fruit?

638
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:30,840
No.

639
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:33,200
It's okay if you don't tell.

640
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:35,400
I have a plenty of time.

641
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:39,200
I can stay here one more night.

642
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:43,400
Please don't torture me anymore.

643
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:44,720
Old man,

644
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:46,600
you must have heard about

645
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:49,440
our Darknight Court's way of doing things.

646
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:52,600
We never give up until we get what we want.

647
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:04,440
I can't believe you.

648
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:05,880
You relented just because

649
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:07,000
of a few good words.

650
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:08,080
My Lady,

651
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:09,800
it wasn't my intention.

652
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:11,920
You don't know

653
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:14,040
how long it took me

654
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:15,280
to catch the rats last night.

655
00:36:19,060 --> 00:36:24,120
(Simple and Incorruptible)

656
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:25,120
But,

657
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:28,080
I do think His Highness
truly cares about you.

658
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:31,720
I couldn't bear to hurt them.

659
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:34,600
Fine.

660
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:37,000
The Celestial Fruit is in our hands anyway.

661
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:40,200
Just let them spend one more night here.

662
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,360
But I can't let them stay long.

663
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,440
So what are you going to do?

664
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:47,360
No worry.

665
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:48,800
As one who always draws clear distinction

666
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,960
between what to gratitude and what to hate,

667
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:53,400
I won't let them to hold me back.

668
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:58,480
Your Highness,

669
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:00,200
let me be straight with you.

670
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:04,080
I really appreciate your help.

671
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:05,000
But,

672
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:06,280
could you find

673
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:07,720
another place to stay?

674
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:09,040
Why?

675
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:11,600
Because...

676
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:13,960
Because we were once engaged.

677
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:16,000
Though the marriage has been canceled,

678
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:19,120
we'd better stay away from each other.

679
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:26,440
After all, you are Crown Prince,

680
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:28,240
and I'm just a...

681
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:31,400
Say it with your mouth. Why do you hit me?

682
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:33,840
Sorry. It was an accident.

683
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:35,680
Don't force it
if you don't know how to flirt.

684
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:37,680
This is not how it shows in play.

685
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:39,000
Anyway,

686
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:40,360
to avoid unnecessary trouble

687
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:41,760
for both of us,

688
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:44,440
please find another place to stay.

689
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:51,680
You really

690
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:56,840
don't know Feng Xiaowu?

691
00:37:58,080 --> 00:37:59,160
I don't.

692
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:00,840
There's no way that I know her.

693
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,280
The Border City is big.

694
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:04,120
How can I know everybody?

695
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:07,600
I think you look quite alike that ugly girl.

696
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:13,040
Is this your way to tell me

697
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:14,240
that I'm ugly?

698
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:19,320
Anyway, we won't leave.

699
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:20,840
We need you.

700
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,960
Why me?

701
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:24,560
Because we need a guide.

702
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:26,520
-I...
-Your Highness.

703
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:31,720
Your Highness.

704
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:33,280
Lord Bi is here.

705
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:34,800
My brother is looking for you.

706
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:45,580
(Chen's Pickles)

707
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:49,560
Uncle Chen,

708
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:51,400
the rock is too heavy.

709
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:52,440
It can't be moved

710
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:53,800
just by the few of us.

711
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:55,880
It's all because of
that Hundred Poison Beast,

712
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:57,640
which always destroys stuff.

713
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:01,320
Inside are the pickles
I've preserved for about half a year.

714
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:02,360
If they are gone,

715
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:04,840
how am I supposed to do my business?

716
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:07,200
Let me help.

717
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:11,920
You?

718
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:24,520
-It's moved.
-It's up.

719
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:30,280
Miss, you are amazing.

720
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:31,360
Now, everything's fine.

721
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:41,880
Now, everything's over.

722
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:43,080
My pickles.

723
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:45,160
My pickles. What should I do?

724
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:46,720
I... I'm sorry.

725
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:48,000
I...

726
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:49,480
Sorry?

727
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:50,280
You...

728
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:52,480
Miss, you can't leave.

729
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:54,080
You've ruined my pickles.

730
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:55,520
You've got to compensate me.

731
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:57,880
I just wanted to help. I don't have money.

732
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:59,960
No money? You still can't leave.

733
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,360
What's going on?

734
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:02,080
It's good that you are here.

735
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:03,240
Please be a fair judge.

736
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:05,960
This Miss pretended to be strong

737
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:07,760
and ruined my pickles.

738
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:08,920
Then she wanted to leave.

739
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:10,120
Can you believe that?

740
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:14,360
Mu Yao.

741
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:15,440
I...

742
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:21,080
Is it enough to compensate your loss?

743
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:22,320
Yes. Yes.

744
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:23,440
It's enough.

745
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:25,440
Thank you. Thanks.

746
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:27,240
Goddess Zuo.

747
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:28,880
Zhao Ge, come with me.

748
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:31,720
Let's clean it up.

749
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:34,400
Your Highness,

750
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:35,840
this is what happened.

751
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:39,040
Someone in the city has seen
the person in the picture

752
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:41,120
visiting an Elixir Refiner's place.

753
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:42,720
Elixir Refiner?

754
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:44,520
Old Man Ba.

755
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:45,760
That's right.

756
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:48,560
Your Highness is indeed insightful.

757
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:49,640
Oh, no.

758
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:50,960
