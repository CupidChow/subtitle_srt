2
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:40,460
(Episode 14)

3
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,040
We don't yet know

4
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:45,800
who the thief is

5
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:47,120
and the thief's goal.

6
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,640
It's not appropriate

7
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:50,560
to send so many people down there.

8
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,000
After all, the real
Water Sky Vase is in there.

9
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:53,960
Then

10
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,960
do you have any suggestions?

11
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,200
If you help me keep
Water Sky Vase,

12
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:00,120
you will have my gratitude.

13
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:02,760
You all should wait here.

14
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:04,360
I will go down there alone

15
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:05,880
to lower the thief's guard.

16
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,440
You must not do that.

17
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:10,240
Your Highness Jun,
you must not take such a risk.

18
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,120
Don't worry.

19
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:12,560
Nothing will happen to me.

20
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,320
Alright then.

21
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,040
Your Highness, be careful.

22
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,240
I dare not

23
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,720
bully Feng Wu

24
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,400
again...

25
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,080
Who is this?

26
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:56,280
Isn't this Young Lady Feng?

27
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,040
You wicked woman have been

28
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,200
harassed by another of like ilk.

29
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,360
Yu Mingye does good

30
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,240
sometimes.

31
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,440
It turns out the Young Lady Feng

32
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:13,920
he referred to was you.

33
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:15,760
I'm not interested in saving you.

34
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,080
Goodbye.

35
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:19,280
You...

36
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:28,200
How come you are so quiet today?

37
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,400
Let me guess.

38
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,920
Did Boss Jun put an incantation on you?

39
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:36,000
Once you curse people,
lightning will strike you.

40
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,560
It's not a big deal.

41
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,920
Everyone loses face at some point.

42
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:08,680
But what you went through

43
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,960
was too embarrassing.

44
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,360
You...

45
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,440
Alright. Stop crying.

46
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,040
You often picked on our Feng Wu.

47
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,390
Now you have had a taste of karma.

48
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,160
You won't dare to pick on her anymore.

49
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,800
Come to think of it,

50
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,800
this is really satisfying.

51
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,200
Feng Wu! This is it!

52
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:38,400
No.

53
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:39,760
To be precise,

54
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:42,720
only its bottom is the Star Shard.

55
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,440
I must have this vase for myself.

56
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:52,520
The vase looks so simple,

57
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,880
unlike a rare treasure.

58
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,720
You fear Jun Linyuan so much?

59
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,960
Every time you saw him,
you acted like a mouse that saw a cat.

60
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,440
You lost your head.

61
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,200
I did not.

62
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:09,640
The thing is,

63
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:12,160
if he sees us together...

64
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,880
I don't want him to feel upset.

65
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,800
The two of us have a clear conscience.

66
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,560
It's his problem if he feels upset.

67
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:21,840
Or do you

68
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,440
want something to happen between us?

69
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,640
I have made things clear to you already.

70
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:27,880
Stop doing that.

71
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:28,960
And

72
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,560
we must not let him know

73
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,200
I gave you the score

74
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,360
for your birthday.

75
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,520
I don't care.

76
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:38,440
I want Jun Linyuan
to be anxious and irritated.

77
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,600
Boring!

78
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,520
Do you

79
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,400
also want this vase?

80
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:50,840
No.

81
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:53,000
I simply think it's beautiful.

82
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,880
So I'm giving it extra attention.

83
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:57,600
Really?

84
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,440
I have the same question.

85
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,560
Why... why are you...

86
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,680
It's not what you think.

87
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,320
Well,

88
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,280
did I interrupt your date?

89
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:10,320
I...

90
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,520
If you want her to live,

91
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,600
let me go.

92
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:15,360
Yes.

93
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,560
I'm held hostage by Yu Mingye.

94
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,680
Save me.

95
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,360
Enough. Drop the act.

96
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,280
I heard everything you said.

97
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:28,840
Tell me.

98
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:30,760
How are we going to end this?

99
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,440
There are people
ready to take action out there.

100
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:33,720
They are waiting for you to go up.

101
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:35,280
I will fight my way up there.

102
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,160
I'd like to see who can stop me.

103
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,320
Many cultivators
have come to Yan's Mansion today.

104
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:41,600
What do you think will happen
if you cause trouble?

105
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:42,800
Besides,

106
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,440
even if you get out,

107
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,520
Feng Wu will still be here.

108
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,120
You two are in this together.

109
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,520
Then do you have any ideas?

110
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,560
Keep acting.

111
00:06:59,000 --> 00:06:59,960
Don't use your spirit energy.

112
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,360
Otherwise, I won't know
how to explain the situation.

113
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:18,480
They are fighting.

114
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,000
Tell me.

115
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,680
Did you try to steal Water Sky Vase,

116
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:34,360
so you could give it to Wu Youdao?

117
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,640
You see through everything.

118
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,080
Go back and tell Lord Demon

119
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,560
to quit resorting to trickery.

120
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,800
The fact that you figured it out

121
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,360
proves you also want

122
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,200
to woo Wu Youdao.

123
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,560
He is a big hidden risk

124
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:08,040
for the Holy Sovereign, isn't he?

125
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:19,240
This is...

126
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,160
You won't have Water Sky Vase.

127
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,000
But you can flee.

128
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,160
What do you say?

129
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,360
Are you leaving or not?

130
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,400
What about Feng Wu?

131
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:27,360
She has got me.

132
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,400
Leave now

133
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,160
or I will change my mind.

134
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,320
Feng Wu, take care.

135
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:36,640
Go.

136
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,560
Don't misunderstand us.

137
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,800
It's not what you think.

138
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,040
Tell me the truth.

139
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,360
Are you related to Darknight Court?

140
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,320
No, absolutely not.

141
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:10,680
I just ran into him here by chance.

142
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:12,120
You two happened to barge in here as thieves.

143
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,000
Were you helping him?

144
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,680
Do you want Water Sky Vase as well?

145
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:26,720
I...

146
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:29,360
Can I explain to you later?

147
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,520
Do you know why I'm mad?

148
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,720
I did this behind your back.

149
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:37,000
Anyone would be mad.

150
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,320
What irritates me more is that

151
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,240
you didn't come to me first
when you needed help.

152
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,200
Don't overthink it.

153
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:51,200
I was a little downhearted.

154
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,080
That's why I didn't tell you.

155
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,800
Yu Mingye is a good guy.

156
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,120
Nothing could ever come into being

157
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,320
between us except friendship.

158
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:01,800
I told him so.

159
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,200
Get out and wait for me.

160
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:08,800
Don't run around.

161
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,280
Your Highness Jun, are you alright?

162
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:52,920
I'm fine.

163
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,320
But he fled.

164
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,040
The thief's spirit energy

165
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,280
is no less powerful than mine.

166
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:01,000
Good to see you safe.

167
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:01,600
What about

168
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,320
Water Sky Vase?

169
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:09,760
I accidentally broke

170
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,360
some of your collectibles

171
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,800
during the fight.

172
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:17,640
It's okay.

173
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,040
It's okay.

174
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:21,840
By the way,

175
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,000
Great Spiritual Master Yan,

176
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,480
I need to consult you about something.

177
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,520
I hope you won't mind.

178
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:29,760
Just say it.

179
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:33,380
-Why haven't Feng Wu and others come yet?
-They are on the road.

180
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,280
Feng Wu is here.

181
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,040
Feng Wu.

182
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:41,960
Why did you come so late?

183
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,640
There are plenty of delicious pastries
in Great Spiritual Master Yan's Mansion.

184
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,800
Sit down and try the pastries.

185
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,720
You are really attentive and thoughtful.

186
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,200
No wonder you are

187
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,640
an exemplary lady in the capital.

188
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:00,840
This way.

189
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:01,680
After you.

190
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:06,360
Excuse me.

191
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:09,160
I need to entertain the guests.

192
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:11,440
This way, please.

193
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:13,800
-Great Spiritual Master Yan.
-Great Spiritual Master Yan.

194
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,440
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

195
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:36,560
Great Spiritual Master Yan
refused to sell the vase

196
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,080
at a high price
or exchange the vase for another treasure.

197
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,840
It seems we need to come up with a new plan.

198
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,960
Great Spiritual Master Yan

199
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:45,280
cares about his relationship
with Madam Yan the most.

200
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:46,600
Madam Yan?

201
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,520
Do you see Concubine Xu over there?

202
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:52,680
Great Spiritual Master Yan and Madam Yan
have been married since they were young.

203
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,240
They used to be a sweet couple.

204
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,680
But Concubine Xu came to the mansion

205
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:58,080
along with all sorts of trouble.

206
00:12:59,000 --> 00:12:59,880
Some time ago,

207
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:02,080
a rumor circulated that Madam Yan's child

208
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,120
wasn't Great Spiritual Master Yan's child.

209
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,560
So a rift appeared between the couple.

210
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:10,080
No wonder Madam Yan
visited the temple alone before her delivery.

211
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:11,920
Her husband didn't go with her.

212
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:13,640
But if Great Spiritual Master Yan

213
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,040
loves his wife so much,

214
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,120
why would he suspect her?

215
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,880
Because the Yan family has a tradition.

216
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:21,000
If the patriarch has a child with his wife,

217
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,720
then the child will show
his or her spirit energy upon birth.

218
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,480
But the child is over a month old now.

219
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:27,840
And the child still shows
no sign of spirit energy.

220
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,440
The child seems to have no talent.

221
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,160
So the rumor spread around Yan's Mansion.

222
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,000
I wondered what happened

223
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:37,120
This is such an outdated belief.

224
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:41,920
I'm sorry

225
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,360
that you were bothered.

226
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,880
Let the banquet continue.

227
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:45,960
Let it continue.

228
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,560
What are you talking about,
Your Highness Jun and Feng Wu?

229
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:57,640
You look mysterious.

230
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:02,120
I'm discussing a mystery
with His Highness Jun.

231
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:04,680
Tell us about it.

232
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,140
I heard a high-rank
spiritual practitioner family

233
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:09,120
has endured for three generations.

234
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:10,680
If the patriarch has a child with his wife,

235
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,840
the child should be born with spirit energy.

236
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:16,720
I didn't know where this belief came from.

237
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:17,640
So

238
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:19,640
I asked His Highness Jun.

239
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:25,800
Cultivators know about this belief.

240
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,760
But it might not be true for everyone.

241
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,280
What do you mean?

242
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,160
Some things

243
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,200
are coincidences.

244
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:36,800
Some other things are natural law.

245
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,080
I don't understand.

246
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,440
We are not gods.

247
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:42,680
How can we prove
if something is a coincidence

248
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:43,960
or natural law?

249
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,200
Your Highness Jun,

250
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:51,160
will you help me?

251
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:57,600
Madam Yan.

252
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:00,520
Do you mind letting me test your son?

253
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,440
This isn't appropriate.

254
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:03,600
Today is...

255
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,720
It's appropriate.

256
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Feng Wu, I will give it a try.

257
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:09,480
Great Spiritual Master, forgive me.

258
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:15,800
Your Highness Jun, let's do the test
about three meridians and seven chakras.

259
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,520
A newly born child

260
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:18,840
only wants to survive.

261
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:21,000
Therefore, his root chakra
is the strongest chakra.

262
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,160
You can start from there.

263
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:23,720
And I will stimulate his brow chakra.

264
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,560
You want to open the child's three meridians?

265
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:26,800
That's right.

266
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:29,160
Miss Feng.

267
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:30,160
Great Spiritual Master Yan,

268
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:31,640
please listen to Feng Wu.

269
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:32,600
I trust her.

270
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,840
Madam Yan, don't worry.

271
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,400
I won't let the child be harmed.

272
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:57,800
Feng Wu,

273
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,760
I trust you and His Highness Jun.

274
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,800
Look. It's the spirit energy lotus.

275
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,640
It's really the spirit energy lotus.

276
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:37,120
I'm sure you all saw it.

277
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:39,160
This child has spirit energy.

278
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,480
Everyone opens their three meridians

279
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:43,880
and rotate their seven chakras
at different times.

280
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:47,960
We shouldn't believe

281
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:49,200
the rumors started by ignorant people.

282
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:50,160
It's simply

283
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,080
ridiculous.

284
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,200
Therefore,

285
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,760
our ancestors sometimes summarized truths

286
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:01,840
and sometimes summarized pure coincidences.

287
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,400
Thank you, Miss Feng Wu.

288
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:08,880
Thank you, Your Highness Jun.

289
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:11,960
Feng Wu,

290
00:17:12,350 --> 00:17:13,960
you are so impressive.

291
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:17,110
If you plan a long stay in the capital,

292
00:17:17,350 --> 00:17:19,590
let's hang out more.

293
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:21,480
Thank you for your commendation, Goddess Zuo.

294
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:47,760
You have failed repeatedly

295
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,080
these days.

296
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:52,000
Have you thought about the reason?

297
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,160
I... I have been neglectful.

298
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:55,480
From now on,

299
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:59,080
I will try harder to complete my tasks.

300
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,440
Don't assume I don't know

301
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:11,400
what you have been doing.

302
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:14,640
Instead of letting other things distract you,

303
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:18,000
you should train hard

304
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,920
to become stronger.

305
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:30,120
Give him some good medicines,

306
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:31,920
lest his work should be affected.

307
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:33,360
Yes.

308
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:53,240
If Zhao Ge hadn't interrupted us and said
she wanted to have fun on the streets,

309
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:54,880
I wouldn't have forgotten my proper business.

310
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:57,920
I should have asked
Great Spiritual Master Yan

311
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:59,360
for Water Sky Vase.

312
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:01,840
Great Spiritual Master Yan

313
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:04,320
has given me Water Sky Vase.

314
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,040
He should give it to me.

315
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:07,880
I solved Great Spiritual Master Yan's

316
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,080
serious problem.

317
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:10,600
If I hadn't

318
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,160
told you the ins and outs,

319
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,760
you wouldn't have
solved the problem so easily.

320
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,520
Since you want that vase,

321
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,600
tell me

322
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:21,640
why you want it.

323
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:24,000
Then I might give it to you.

324
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:27,840
I have my reason.

325
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:28,840
What is it?

326
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:34,400
I want a gift too.

327
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:39,320
What gift?

328
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:42,000
You gave Yu Mingye a gift.

329
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:43,560
What about me?

330
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,880
I gave him a gift because...

331
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:47,520
Because of what?

332
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:48,800
His birthday is my birthday.

333
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,000
How come he got a gift and I got nothing?

334
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:51,680
I...

335
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:55,200
I didn't know.

336
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:56,400
Besides,

337
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:58,000
nobody ever mentioned it.

338
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,440
You are Crown Prince.

339
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:02,160
A lot of people should

340
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,280
celebrate your birthday and give you gifts.

341
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:04,160
It's none of your business.

342
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,680
Now that you know it was my birthday,

343
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:10,240
what are you going to give me?

344
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:11,680
I will...

345
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:13,560
Give...

346
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:15,680
Give...

347
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:18,800
If you

348
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:20,480
pass Junwu Academy's entrance exam

349
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:21,960
and consider it a birthday gift for me,

350
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:24,240
I will give you Water Sky Vase.

351
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,280
It's fair trade,

352
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:27,680
isn't it?

353
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:29,640
At the end of the day,

354
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,440
you just don't like the fact that
my spirit energy is low,

355
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:33,320
and I am not matched for your marriage.

356
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:34,480
Alright. I will take it as your agreement.

357
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:36,080
You will take Junwu Academy's entrance exam.

358
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:37,760
I'll get going. Don't go back on your word.

359
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:38,960
But...

360
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:56,520
Jun Linyuan, you are so cunning.

361
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:58,080
Anyway,

362
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,120
I will take the entrance exam
for Water Sky Vase.

363
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,600
I won't do it for you.

364
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:08,240
Wu loves pine nut candy.

365
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:11,240
Wu's mother loves osmanthus cake.

366
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:14,640
I will bring Mr. Xuan Yi hazelnut cookies.

367
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:15,760
I...

368
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:19,320
I won't have anything.

369
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:20,960
I don't want to gain weight again.

370
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:24,920
Senior Sister.

371
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:43,120
Senior Sister.

372
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:44,920
I should go back.

373
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:46,920
If I hamper your cultivation,

374
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,760
leader won't be happy.

375
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,960
A short conversation
won't hamper my cultivation.

376
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:54,080
Where do you live now?

377
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,240
In Wu's place.

378
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,080
The Feng's Mansion in the capital?

379
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:03,040
The Feng family in the capital
isn't easygoing.

380
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:04,520
Living in their mansion

381
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:06,000
means you are at the mercy of their whims.

382
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:07,480
Zhao Ge,

383
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:09,480
you are a member of Celestial Palace.

384
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,800
Now that Celestial Palace's

385
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,600
female disciples

386
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:15,080
came to the capital

387
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,160
to prepare for Junwu Academy's entrance exam,

388
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:19,120
you might as well move in with us

389
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:21,040
to review the texts
and prepare for the exam with us.

390
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:22,040
Me?

391
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:24,800
Numerous cultivators would fight for a place

392
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:26,440
in Junwu Academy.

393
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:28,600
I'm afraid I can't do it.

394
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,600
How do you know when you have not even tried?

395
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:31,840
Besides,

396
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,080
if you get into Junwu Academy,

397
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:36,960
Master will be elated.

398
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,280
Forget it.

399
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:39,760
I can't do it.

400
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:41,040
Then

401
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:43,200
what if Feng Wu wants to take the exam?

402
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:44,600
Wu?

403
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:47,000
She successfully overcame the challenges
at Peerless Tower

404
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,360
and hogged the limelight
in Great Spiritual Master Yan's Mansion.

405
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:50,800
She looks close

406
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:53,240
to His Highness Jun.

407
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:55,800
You don't know

408
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:58,160
if she returned to the capital for success.

409
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,000
If she seeks success,

410
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:02,600
she will want to enroll in Junwu Academy.

411
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:05,240
If Wu gets into Junwu Academy

412
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,720
and restores her cultivation base,

413
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:09,960
I will be happy for her.

414
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:13,240
But if she gets into Junwu Academy,

415
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:15,240
I won't get to see her every day.

416
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:17,640
No.

417
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,880
I... I must try to pass the exam.

418
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:21,880
Then you should move in with us.

419
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:23,320
I will supervise your cultivation.

420
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:24,880
Senior Sister,

421
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,000
I don't think it's a good idea.

422
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:29,040
I'm no longer
a member of Celestial Palace.

423
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:30,120
Besides,

424
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,080
they don't want me there.

425
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:34,600
You should

426
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,920
stay away from me.

427
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,080
Why?

428
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:40,120
They may not care about you,

429
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:42,360
but I do.

430
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:44,720
We grew up together.

431
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:46,120
Have you forgotten?

432
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:48,040
Senior Sister,

433
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:50,960
after Feng Wu
ventured into Peerless Tower

434
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:52,480
and obtained the antidote for me,

435
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,400
I have done a lot of thinking.

436
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:57,120
I know I have been making progress slowly.

437
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:58,480
Leader has been dissatisfied with me.

438
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:00,560
My Senior Sisters have been
dissatisfied with me.

439
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:02,840
They think
I have disgraced Celestial Palace

440
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,520
as leader's daughter.

441
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,760
When I was poisoned

442
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:09,600
and most miserable,

443
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,480
Celestial Palace ignored me.

444
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:14,200
Celestial Palace and I

445
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,000
are a burden to each other.

446
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:22,960
It's okay.

447
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:25,000
I will live happily from now on.

448
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:26,280
Zhao Ge,

449
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:27,200
that's not true.

450
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:27,920
Senior Sister,

451
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:30,960
I know we have been friends since childhood,

452
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:34,240
but I'm completely disappointed

453
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,320
in Celestial Palace.

454
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:37,520
You have so many things to do.

455
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:39,720
Don't waste too much energy on me.

456
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:42,720
Senior Sister,

457
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:44,160
I will go back now.

458
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:47,080
Don't worry about me.

459
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:50,000
Take care.

460
00:24:58,680 --> 00:24:59,640
Zhao Ge.

461
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:01,480
That's not true.

462
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,800
I never gave you up.

463
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:06,160
I never stopped looking for
an antidote for you.

464
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:07,320
But...

465
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:24,440
What's wrong with him?

466
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,040
Young Master failed to complete

467
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:28,560
the task Lord Demon gave him.

468
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,240
So he was punished after he came back.

469
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:33,640
He just took the medicine and fell asleep.

470
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,840
Did he take a music score back?

471
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:54,200
Never mind.

472
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:55,760
Feng Wu.

473
00:25:58,480 --> 00:25:59,880
I'm not letting this pass.

474
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,040
She is mine.

475
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:22,560
You are not even allowed to dream about her.

476
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:32,480
Don't wipe it clean.

477
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:49,200
Drink.

478
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:50,600
Yes.

479
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:13,480
You are dismissed.

480
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:14,840
Yes.

481
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:28,720
Gao Wei.

482
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:31,800
You must have heard

483
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:33,840
about the capable lady

484
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:35,360
who came to the capital recently.

485
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:38,480
She overcame the challenges
at Peerless Tower.

486
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:40,920
She is the heir of the Feng family.

487
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:43,280
She is Feng Wu,
the Fifth Young Lady of the Feng family

488
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:45,240
who used to be engaged

489
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:46,120
to His Highness Jun.

490
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:49,480
She lost her Phoenix Blood

491
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:50,880
along with her cultivation base.

492
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,520
Now she

493
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:53,800
has recovered so much spirit energy.

494
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:54,880
I guess

495
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:56,400
she must have had some fortuitous adventures.

496
00:27:58,440 --> 00:27:59,360
Was Crown Prince

497
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:01,360
referring to her when he said

498
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:03,800
he had already chosen a woman

499
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,200
as his Spiritual Princess?

500
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:09,080
How much spirit energy does Feng Wu have?

501
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:11,040
Before she ventured into Peerless Tower,

502
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,320
she was already
a medium-rank spiritual practitioner.

503
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:15,840
If she becomes a
senior-rank spiritual practitioner,

504
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:18,120
she will be eligible
for Spiritual Princess's position.

505
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:22,320
I don't care if she is lucky or capable.

506
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:24,200
Jun Linyuan must not

507
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:26,280
have someone like her at his side.

508
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:28,200
Your Majesty,

509
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:29,480
according to my knowledge,

510
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:32,080
Wu Youdao will take up
the role of Junwu Academy's Supervisor.

511
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:33,840
If you have his support,

512
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,120
it will be easier for you

513
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:37,800
to win Junwu Academy over.

514
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:39,520
By then,

515
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:41,360
the students should be able to
achieve greatness in the capital,

516
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43,640
considering the forces they command.

517
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:46,320
I have an idea.

518
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:48,120
Convey my order.

519
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:51,800
Tell Zuo Qingluan to receive
Supervisor Wu outside the city gate

520
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:54,280
on behalf of the noble students.

521
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:56,840
She is a clever child.

522
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:59,520
She should know what to do.

523
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:00,320
Yes,

524
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:01,600
Your Majesty.

525
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:10,860
(Guiyuan Yard)

526
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,560
Well done. You found me.

527
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:27,440
Feng Xun told me.

528
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:29,080
He said you would be here.

529
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:30,160
If you are here

530
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,640
for Water Sky Vase,

531
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:32,720
then like I said, I will only give it to you

532
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,600
after you pass Junwu Academy's entrance exam.

533
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:37,720
Is this necessary?

534
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:39,160
You sound niggardly.

535
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:41,640
Actually, I have something for you.

536
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:42,400
Come here.

537
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:00,560
What is this?

538
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:02,280
This is a cake.

539
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:04,400
People eat this thing on their birthday.

540
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,760
Alright. Make a wish.

541
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,760
I know people would pray to the gods.

542
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:25,040
But I've never heard of
making a wish under candlelight.

543
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:27,080
It's daytime.

544
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:28,800
Why did you light a candle?

545
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:31,040
I told you to make a wish. Just do it.

546
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:32,400
Come on. Make a wish.

547
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:38,320
Done.

548
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:41,480
You made a wish already?

549
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:44,440
What wish did you make?

550
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:47,800
If I tell you,

551
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,480
my wish won't come true.

552
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:54,360
You are getting the hang of this.

553
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:56,920
By the way,

554
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:59,320
why didn't you tell me about your birthday?

555
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,480
I could have been prepared for your birthday.

556
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:03,760
It's not worth mentioning.

557
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:05,680
My birthday

558
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:08,360
is not a happy day for me.

559
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:10,840
I'm celebrating your birthday with you.

560
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:11,960
Just tell me.

561
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:20,960
A woman once lived in this world.

562
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:24,120
She was beautiful, demure, gentle, virtuous,

563
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:25,560
noble and unsullied.

564
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,160
She was admired by Junwu's people.

565
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:30,960
Why is she kneeling there?

566
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:32,040
She made a mistake.

567
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:36,960
Go help her up.

568
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:37,600
Yes.

569
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:04,840
She gave rewards and punishments fairly.

570
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:06,560
She sympathized with the people's sufferings.

571
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:09,480
Here. Drink some tea.

572
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,360
Remember

573
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:20,320
not to make that mistake again.

574
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:21,360
Yes.

575
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:23,120
She could have seen the Continent

576
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:24,520
become better and better.

577
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:25,480
But

578
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:27,160
on the day of my birth...

579
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:34,240
Xue'er.

580
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:40,320
Give me.

581
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:45,520
Look.

582
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:47,120
Our child.

583
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:50,160
Look.

584
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:54,880
I wish I could see you

585
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:58,320
in armor,

586
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:01,720
looking mighty and powerful.

587
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:08,080
You will govern Junwu well.

588
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,160
What a shame

589
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:15,160
that I won't get to see you do that.

590
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:19,640
Xue'er!

591
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:21,760
Xue'er!

592
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:23,120
Xue'er!

593
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:25,800
Xue'er!

594
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:29,640
That's your mother?

595
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:33,520
Do you know what she looked like?

596
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:35,280
I have never seen her.

597
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:37,880
When I was little,

598
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:40,680
I could stare at my mother's portrait

599
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:44,160
for a whole day.

600
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:46,680
But the portrait was too blurry.

601
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:49,160
I could only picture

602
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:51,040
the mother I imagined

603
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:53,640
in my mind again and again.

604
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:56,080
Sometimes I wondered

605
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:58,400
whether giving birth to me

606
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:01,480
was the right decision for her.

607
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:04,000
Perhaps things would be better without me.

608
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:08,560
I used to think the same.

609
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:09,960
For what

610
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:11,520
do people live?

611
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:13,640
Everyone dies eventually.

612
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:15,360
Then

613
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:16,760
my mother told me

614
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:19,560
children were
a continuation of their parents.

615
00:34:20,230 --> 00:34:21,320
They are a continuation of their parents.

616
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:23,080
We are a continuation of our parents.

617
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:25,920
All in all, true death

618
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:27,600
is not the demise of the human body,

619
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,190
but being forgotten by the world.

620
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:31,710
But

621
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:33,670
your mother has always been there

622
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:35,880
because you often think about her.

623
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:37,080
Am I right?

624
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:42,000
You are right.

625
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:44,230
Thank you.

626
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:12,960
Your Majesty.

627
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:16,040
Many things happened these days.

628
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:17,480
My mind wandered a little.

629
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:19,160
I'm sorry that I bothered you.

630
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:20,480
Please forgive me.

631
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:24,840
You have always been sensible.

632
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:27,920
I guess your troubles

633
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:29,520
have made you lose your head.

634
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:34,680
You can tell me what is bothering you.

635
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:38,440
Maybe I can give you some advice.

636
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:43,600
The other day,

637
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:45,400
I met His Highness Jun.

638
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:49,720
But he seemed to care a lot about Miss Feng.

639
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:51,440
Since I was little, Feng Wu and I

640
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:53,120
have been compared.

641
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:54,040
I...

642
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:57,840
So that is what's bothering you.

643
00:35:58,440 --> 00:35:59,800
I wondered what happened.

644
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:01,800
It seems you

645
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:03,800
are more concerned about defeating Miss Feng.

646
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:05,480
I'm sorry for showing you

647
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:06,720
my petty jealousy.

648
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:10,320
It's normal for young people
to lose their cool.

649
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:11,840
Qingluan,

650
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:13,840
you have your own advantages.

651
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:15,800
Celestial Palace supports you.

652
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:18,200
Your Great Spiritual Master's title
gives you confidence.

653
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:19,760
And you have got me

654
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:21,640
as your helper.

655
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,680
Thank you for taking pity on me.

656
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:25,360
I'm greatly grateful to you.

657
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:28,680
Have you heard of Wu Youdao?

658
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:32,640
This man has a strong cultivation base.

659
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:34,480
He will come to the capital for work.

660
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:37,000
If you learn from him,

661
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:39,400
you will cultivate more easily

662
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:42,840
and your status will improve greatly.

663
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:43,920
By then,

664
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:45,920
the gap between you and Miss Feng

665
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:47,640
will be wider.

666
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:51,960
Anyone with sense
will make the right decision.

667
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:53,480
Thank you for your advice.

668
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:56,160
Alright.

669
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,000
Let's eat.

670
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:04,920
Thank you, Your Majesty.

671
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:09,340
(Feng's Mansion)

672
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:16,720
He stinks of wine.

673
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:18,360
How much did you drink?

674
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:21,120
He is staying in your place tonight.

675
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:22,320
He

676
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:23,400
is drunk.

677
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:25,240
And you took him to my place?

678
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:27,280
He lives in Junwu Divine Hall.

679
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:28,760
How am I supposed to enter Junwu Divine Hall?

680
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:30,360
Why would I come to you otherwise?

681
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:30,920
I...

682
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:33,640
Your family is wealthy.

683
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:35,080
It's easy to find a guest room here.

684
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:37,600
Besides, he is your Boss Jun.

685
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:38,960
Yes.

686
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:45,080
Do you know

687
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:47,440
where he put Water Sky Vase?

688
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:50,440
Even if you know the location,
you can't have it.

689
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:52,040
He put a spell on the vase.

690
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:54,080
Nobody except him can touch it.

691
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:57,480
Where are you going?

692
00:37:58,720 --> 00:37:59,800
The guest room.

693
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:36,800
You...

694
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:39,520
-Let me go.
-Don't leave me.

695
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:39,920
You...

696
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:41,320
Don't leave me.

697
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:43,160
Don't leave.

698
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:45,640
Don't leave.

699
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:48,120
Don't leave.

700
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:50,640
I know.

701
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:53,000
I won't leave you.

702
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:05,040
I don't want to leave you.

703
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:07,920
But I don't know

704
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:10,080
what lies ahead.

705
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:13,560
Will you face it together with me?

706
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:43,520
Your Highness Jun,

707
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:45,600
you drank a lot last night.

708
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:46,520
You must be feeling awful.

709
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:49,240
I got breakfast for you.

710
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:50,320
Eat these foods.

711
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:51,840
Eat them and you'll feel better.

712
00:39:58,880 --> 00:39:59,960
What exactly do you want?

713
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:02,280
I want nothing.

714
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:05,400
Are you sure?

715
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:11,040
I'm worried that you might be feeling ill.

716
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:12,920
So I'm trying to serve you.

717
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:16,440
By the way,

718
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:20,280
here is your birthday gift.

719
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:31,800
Your Highness Jun.

720
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:34,160
This.

721
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:18,720
I wish I could see you

722
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:22,160
in armor,

723
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:25,800
looking mighty and powerful.

724
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:32,440
You will govern Junwu well.

725
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,160
Water Sky Vase...

726
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:49,480
I wanted to give it to you.

727
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:50,360
Really?

728
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:50,920
No.

729
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:52,720
You just said

730
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:53,720
you wanted nothing.

731
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:55,080
So let's forget about it.

732
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:56,400
No.

733
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:58,640
You promised to pass
Junwu Academy's entrance exam.

734
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:00,600
We will talk after you pass the exam.

735
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:09,000
