(Episode 11)

3
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,720
See no evil. I...

4
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,080
Um. I...

5
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:24,760
I...

6
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,240
Are you OK?

7
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:45,760
I'm good.

8
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,760
Having been cultivating since childhood,
I've got great spirit energy.

9
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,920
I wasn't hurt.

10
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,480
Sorry. I didn't mean it.

11
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,800
It was just a reflex action.

12
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,760
As a reflex,

13
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:55,680
you want to kiss me?

14
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,160
No.

15
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,160
If you want, just tell me directly.

16
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:02,560
Don't be bashful.

17
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,360
Anyhow, you'll be my Spiritual Princess.

18
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,440
No matter what you want, I'll say yes.

19
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,080
Well, you're cute.

20
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,480
Exposed by me,

21
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:11,760
you were ashamed into anger.

22
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,640
I'm not. I just...

23
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:16,480
Forget it.

24
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:17,840
It's hard to explain it clearly to you.

25
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,800
Anyhow, it wasn't as you thought.

26
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,120
Just now you said

27
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:25,840
no matter what I want, you'd say yes, right?

28
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,880
Keep your words.

29
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:36,360
Fifth Young Lady,

30
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,960
thank you for what you've done for us.

31
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:40,320
Yeah.

32
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:41,800
I really appreciate it.

33
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,160
If there is a chance,
you must come to Yan's Mansion.

34
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:46,360
And I will ask my husband
to say thanks to you personally.

35
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,920
You're welcome, Madam Yan.

36
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,560
Having given birth to a baby,
you're still very weak.

37
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,320
It's better for you to go back and rest up.

38
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:54,880
By the way,

39
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,080
I have asked the guards

40
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,360
to leave horses and food to you.

41
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,880
You'd better return to the capital
as soon as possible.

42
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:02,600
Thanks a lot.

43
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,000
What's up?

44
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,200
Didn't you say

45
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,520
no matter what I want, you would say yes?

46
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:43,880
What do you want?

47
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:46,840
A kiss!

48
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,960
Young Master Feng.
Young Master Xuan Yi.

49
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,320
Hearing that both of you came,

50
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,880
Mrs. Feng asked me to invite you there.

51
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:11,880
No, thanks.

52
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:14,840
Now that we've finished our task,
we won't go inside.

53
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,800
Madam, you're also back.

54
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,200
Take her to her room to settle in.

55
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,000
Madam. This way, please.

56
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:35,080
Thank you for your care during the journey.

57
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,200
You're welcome, Madam.

58
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,720
Please send my thanks to His Highness Jun.

59
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,960
Take it easy. I'm sure to tell him.

60
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,320
Excuse me.

61
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:00,400
You two.

62
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,520
Don't leave, please.

63
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:03,560
Mrs. Feng is still waiting for you.

64
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,680
With something important to do,

65
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:05,640
we must go.

66
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:06,400
See you.

67
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:14,200
Xuan Yi,

68
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:16,520
have you found that
the Feng Family seems a little strange?

69
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,120
I'm wondering if Feng Wu will be bullied

70
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,440
after she goes back.

71
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,200
Indeed, it's a little strange.

72
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,840
But according to Feng Wu's character,

73
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,440
she is not likely to be bullied.

74
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:25,760
It makes sense.

75
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:26,800
She's a tough girl

76
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,920
that answers blows with blows.

77
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:30,840
Let's go get something to eat.

78
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:31,720
No.

79
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,240
I need some peace.

80
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:39,880
Come on.

81
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,320
He's so boring.

82
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:44,040
I'm wondering
which girl will fall in love with him.

83
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:47,760
On the way to the capital,

84
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:49,400
maybe there won't be demonic beasts.

85
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:50,840
Going with me,

86
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,240
I'm sure you can arrive there safely.

87
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:53,480
Your Highness,

88
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:56,000
why don't we set off immediately

89
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:56,880
like Madam Yan

90
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:59,080
but stay here for a few more days?

91
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,760
Fighting with the Blood Demon Dragon,

92
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,120
I was hurt in my spirit energy.

93
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,440
So, I need to have a rest.

94
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,880
OK. I am a little tired.

95
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,280
You can also go back to have a rest.

96
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,600
Yes, Your Highness.

97
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,480
Didn't you tell Qiu Ling that

98
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,320
you had great spirit energy
and there was nothing wrong with you?

99
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:59,680
You're not a slowcoach.

100
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,160
Could it be that
you want to stay with me for longer?

101
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,600
So, you don't hurry to leave, right?

102
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:07,120
Yeah!

103
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:09,080
You...

104
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,360
You admitted it?

105
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,400
Eventually you told the truth.

106
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,960
Hurry up. Talk nicely.

107
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,560
For example...

108
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,880
I like you. I like...

109
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:19,640
you so much.

110
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:22,280
Why did you block for me?

111
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,960
Why did you block for me?

112
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:27,080
Jun Linyuan.

113
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,320
My God!

114
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,440
Is your Loveless Insect Venom detoxified?

115
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,560
You can talk normally!

116
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:44,720
Enough! Enough!

117
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:46,840
You can leave now!

118
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,320
I'm really tired.

119
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,000
I like you.

120
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,120
I like you.

121
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,640
Didn't you tell me you've
distanced yourself from His Highness Jun?

122
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,640
My lady. What do you mean by doing this?

123
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:11,480
Qiu Ling.

124
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:14,080
How did you learn to eavesdrop?

125
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:15,960
It's not good.

126
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:17,720
My lady.

127
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,480
Don't change the topic.

128
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,320
I've told you it's not as you thought.

129
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:23,520
Forget it.

130
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,280
It's a long story.

131
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,880
No matter how much you like him,
don't be too anxious.

132
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:31,720
You need to learn to play hard-to-get.

133
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:36,320
I've told you it's not as you thought.

134
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:37,160
No.

135
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,360
I can't let you do that.

136
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:41,640
We need to discuss with your mom.

137
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,280
What to discuss?

138
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,760
If so, there'll be no chance for me
to get the Wanyou Fire.

139
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,160
Anyhow,

140
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:49,080
I'm sure to kiss him.

141
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:11,840
Jun Linyuan.

142
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,000
Jun Linyuan.

143
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:16,240
Jun Linyuan. Don't run.

144
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:17,800
You...

145
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,120
Jun Linyuan.

146
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:20,000
Stop.

147
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:23,720
You hate my kissing you that much?

148
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:26,040
I just want to know why you want to kiss me,

149
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,600
but you never told me.

150
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:31,320
Do I need a reason to kiss you?

151
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:32,520
If so,

152
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:33,560
it doesn't matter who you kiss, right?

153
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:35,840
I won't kiss others.

154
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:36,800
They don't have...

155
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:37,520
What don't they have?

156
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,680
No, I mean...

157
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,080
What don't they have?

158
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:44,640
They... they are not you.

159
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,840
Previously,

160
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,720
you told me you had nothing to do with me.

161
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,440
Now you keep flirting with me.

162
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,040
Feng Wu. What on earth do you want to do?

163
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:00,680
Fine.

164
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,600
I won't kiss you, OK?

165
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,960
It's all Grandpa Ba's fault.

166
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:07,480
He said there is Wanyou Fire
in the body of Blood Demon Dragon.

167
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,880
Losing Phoenix Blood,

168
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:12,800
I was hurt in my spiritual cognition
and lost my cultivation base.

169
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,320
Though I can cultivate again
by eating the Celestial Fruit,

170
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:18,040
compared with other cultivators,

171
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,480
I am still weak.

172
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:22,040
If I can take in the Wanyou Fire...

173
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,720
What does it have to do with kissing me?

174
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:27,400
When the Blood Demon Dragon died,

175
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,040
you were the one
who had the greatest spirit energy.

176
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:31,840
It was certain that
you had swallowed the Wanyou Fire,

177
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,680
although you didn't notice it.

178
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:35,960
If I can kiss you...

179
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,720
So, you are making use of me, right?

180
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:42,920
Come on.

181
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,520
I just want you to do me a favor.

182
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,560
But I'm afraid you won't agree.

183
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:51,040
Well, I also have my own thoughts.

184
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,680
You've got enough Wanyou Fire.

185
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,160
When will you stop kissing?

186
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,680
The State of Jin still has offspring.

187
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,400
So, there must be a monarch.

188
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:51,320
Only the monarch can hold
the sacrifice ceremony for the State of Jin.

189
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,520
He was appointed by Heaven.

190
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:56,400
But the several people...

191
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:58,520
Sorry. Sorry. I have something urgent to do.

192
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:05,040
It...

193
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:06,240
It doesn't matter.

194
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,520
You just use these herbs to fool us.

195
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:45,920
Don't you feel embarrassed?

196
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,080
Yeah.

197
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:49,240
You said you were a cultivator.

198
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:51,520
With only a little spirit energy,
you can't convince us.

199
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:54,640
It took me much time to get these herbs.

200
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,760
As long as you take them,

201
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,200
you may improve your spirit energy,

202
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:00,120
and I'm sure it can build up your body.

203
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:02,680
What's the point of
building up our body by eating this?

204
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,000
Why not get
some essence of spirit animals for us?

205
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:07,440
Selling it, we can get much money.

206
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,240
The spirit animals don't do evil.

207
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:11,000
They can't be killed randomly.

208
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:11,960
Forget it.

209
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,400
We can get nothing from her.

210
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:14,600
Let's go.

211
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:15,720
Get out of the way.

212
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,000
They treat you like that.

213
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,040
Why don't you resist?

214
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,800
It's just that life got in their way.

215
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:46,720
It seems that they are not bad people.

216
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,040
It's good to be kind.

217
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,640
But kindness
without principles and bottom lines

218
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,000
is just cowardliness.

219
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,200
Outrageous.

220
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:29,440
Feng Wu even covets His Highness Jun.

221
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,600
Does she really think
she will be the Spiritual Princess?

222
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:33,560
Why can't you keep calm?

223
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:35,640
But, Senior Sister,

224
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,120
His Highness Jun is yours.

225
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:39,560
Feng Liu is really useless.

226
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,560
She even failed to prevent that woman

227
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:43,120
getting close to His Highness Jun.

228
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,280
Life is like playing chess.

229
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:46,960
Only at the last minute

230
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,080
can you know who the winner is.

231
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:52,680
Keep asking Feng Liu about

232
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,120
the improvement of Feng Wu's spirit energy.

233
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,040
Senior Sister,

234
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,160
hearing that

235
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,360
Feng Wu is intimate

236
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,080
with His Highness Jun,

237
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:05,000
why don't you care about

238
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,280
His Highness Jun's attitude

239
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:09,360
but pay attention to
Feng Wu's cultivation base?

240
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,480
His Highness Jun's attitude

241
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:12,760
doesn't matter.

242
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:15,000
What I care is

243
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:17,880
whether I can be
the Spiritual Princess eventually.

244
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:19,920
We just need to keep watch on Feng Wu.

245
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:21,920
Go to tell Master that

246
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,760
we'll leave for the capital tomorrow.

247
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:24,520
Got it.

248
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,000
Come and have a look.

249
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,400
Steamed buns!

250
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,040
Hot steamed buns!

251
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:50,800
My lady. Look!

252
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:52,400
Great changes have taken place here.

253
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:53,640
Look there.

254
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:14,680
Brother.

255
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:31,680
Who are you?

256
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:33,680
Sorry, Chief Maid.

257
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:35,680
I am Qiu Ling, Fifth Young Lady's maid.

258
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,280
I just arrived in the capital with her.

259
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,200
Now that Fifth Young Lady just came back,

260
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:41,120
where has she gone?

261
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,040
Where is she?

262
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,320
She couldn't wait to see Madam,

263
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,760
so, she left early.

264
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,400
Which Madam do you mean?

265
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:49,800
There is only one Mrs. Feng
in the Feng's Mansion.

266
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,840
She's waiting for Fifth Young Lady
in the drawing room.

267
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,320
Don't make her wait too long.

268
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:54,680
I know.

269
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,600
I'm going back to tell Fifth Young Lady.

270
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:05,680
Mom.

271
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,400
Feng Wu.

272
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:13,920
Bad-mannered.

273
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,040
Pay respect to Mrs. Feng.

274
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:25,200
Wish you good health, Mrs. Feng.

275
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,280
Chief Maid Zhao

276
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:32,200
didn't leave time for us to have a drink,

277
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:33,840
urging us to come here.

278
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,600
I think it's you who showed solicitude
to us younger generation.

279
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,680
Knowing that we just arrived from far away,

280
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:41,080
you specially asked us
to have tea here, right?

281
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:43,600
What a glib girl!

282
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:46,480
Yes, Madam.

283
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:53,880
For one thing,
we are here to talk about the old days.

284
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:55,760
For another,

285
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:57,760
as the master of the family,

286
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:00,840
I want to discuss with you
about the Phoenix Sword.

287
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,760
It turns out that
you want to talk about this.

288
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:10,920
Wu.

289
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:13,240
After all, you're a girl

290
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,280
with little spirit energy.

291
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,080
It's not convenient for you
to appear in public.

292
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:20,560
Being the inheritor of the Feng Family

293
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:21,800
is just a burden on you.

294
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:25,480
Anyhow, you will get married
and give birth in the future.

295
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:29,840
Well.

296
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,640
I happen to have no interest in

297
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:32,960
being the inheritor of the Feng Family.

298
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:41,160
You think I am not qualified

299
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,800
to be the inheritor
of the Feng Family, right?

300
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:45,560
Here you are.

301
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:49,720
Since Wu said so,

302
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,960
it's not good for us to refuse it.

303
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,160
Take it.

304
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,600
What's wrong?

305
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:22,880
I forgot to tell you

306
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:25,280
the Phoenix Sword is very spiritual.

307
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:26,520
Clearly,

308
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:28,120
it has set its mind on me.

309
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:30,320
What about making another sword

310
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:32,440
and giving you as the family heirloom?

311
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:33,600
I can

312
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:36,680
call it "small tricks sword".

313
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:38,320
It's a suitable name.

314
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,120
You really can't tell good from bad!

315
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:42,400
If you're not punished today,

316
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,680
you won't know
who is the master of our family.

317
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:53,760
I'm afraid that
I don't deserve to have your tea.

318
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,480
I'm leaving with my mom now.

319
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:57,080
You!

320
00:20:59,200 --> 00:20:59,840
Let's go.

321
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:20,860
Junwu Gate

322
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:25,140
Guanghua Hall

323
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:29,520
Your Highness.

324
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:30,960
His Majesty is here, right?

325
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:31,560
Yes.

326
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,520
Her Majesty has got an ancient book
for His Majesty recently,

327
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,920
saying that there is a recipe inside
to improve spiritual intelligence.

328
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:39,280
His Majesty is very happy these days.

329
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:52,520
Let me pay my respect, Your Majesties.

330
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:53,720
You're here.

331
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:57,840
You have been rushing
for the birthday gift for His Majesty.

332
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:58,880
Thank you for your hard work.

333
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:03,840
It's you who came up with the idea of

334
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:05,880
collecting the blessings of people, right?

335
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:12,920
You're considerate.

336
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:16,760
He always looks cold
but is actually kind-hearted.

337
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,360
I heard that you went to the Border City

338
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:22,440
and got help
from the goddess of Celestial Palace,

339
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,240
surrendering the demonic beast
together with her.

340
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:25,840
Is it true?

341
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:27,200
Yes.

342
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:30,840
What do you think of Goddess Zuo?

343
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:32,520
She has good spirit energy.

344
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:38,200
Your Majesty.

345
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:41,920
He still doesn't know the ways of the world.

346
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,760
What can we do?

347
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,200
Yuan.

348
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:48,360
You're old enough.

349
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,320
It's time to consider your marriage.

350
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,080
With good family background,

351
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,080
Zuo Qingluan is also
the goddess of Celestial Palace

352
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:56,400
with outstanding manners and appearance.

353
00:22:56,680 --> 00:23:00,240
I think she is a good match for you.

354
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:01,400
As for the Spiritual Princess,

355
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:02,840
I have a suitable choice.

356
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:08,520
He has found his love.

357
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,080
Well, you should know

358
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,400
the rules of the Junwu Clan.

359
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:15,280
Only girls become high-rank spiritual practitioner

360
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,840
are qualified for
the Spiritual Princess election contest.

361
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:21,040
I'm wondering

362
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,000
how many girls

363
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,920
have such qualifications in the capital.

364
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:27,920
I won't bother you. Your Majesty.

365
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:29,120
At the right time,

366
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:30,920
I will tell you, Your Majesties.

367
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:34,520
Darling.

368
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:37,440
He has had his own idea
since he was very young.

369
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:39,200
OK.

370
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:42,480
It's good for you to have your loved one.

371
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:44,000
You can get married as soon as possible

372
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:47,680
to take a load off her mind.

373
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:50,520
I guess

374
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:53,960
the girl whom you took a fancy to
must be extraordinary.

375
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:57,520
Her appearance, moral qualities,
family background and spirit energy

376
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:59,720
must be best of all.

377
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:03,560
Then I'll just wait for your good news.

378
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:17,860
Tongqi Pavilion

379
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:19,040
Feng Wu. Here.

380
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,400
I just sewed the clothes for you.

381
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:22,520
Try it on.

382
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:24,880
Alright. Mom.

383
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:27,760
You made it for me. It must be very suitable.

384
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,160
I haven't seen you for a long time.

385
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:32,320
Sit down to chat with me.

386
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:35,480
Do you know

387
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:38,000
why I agreed to come to the capital
with Jun Linyuan?

388
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,000
Weren't you forced by him?

389
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:45,880
I know you are not pleased these years.

390
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:47,800
You always want to
recover your cultivation base.

391
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:49,200
Not until you held

392
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:51,280
your father's sword

393
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,320
did I realize that

394
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:56,160
it was no use restraining you.

395
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:58,840
You're bound to the master of Phoenix Sword.

396
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:01,560
You should experience what you have to.

397
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:04,480
I can't make you overcautious.

398
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,160
Sorry, mom.

399
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:08,600
I'm too selfish.

400
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,240
I'm the one who's selfish.

401
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:14,920
I won't prevent you anymore.

402
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:18,000
Feng Wu.

403
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:21,360
On the way back with His Highness Jun,

404
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:23,480
he cared for me very well.

405
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:26,800
It's clear that he has a fancy to you.

406
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,200
Have you thought over to accept him?

407
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:37,040
She's really gone too far.

408
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:38,080
Mom.

409
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,280
Calm down.

410
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:41,560
Feng Wu

411
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:43,440
has been arrogant for a long time.

412
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:45,640
Don't be angry lest you fall ill.

413
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:54,000
Feng Liu.

414
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:55,200
Speaking of this,

415
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,000
I need to blame you.

416
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:58,840
I have told you early

417
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,520
to give up on His Highness Jun

418
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,360
and stop wishful thinking.

419
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:03,920
But you didn't follow my advice.

420
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:05,520
Enough.

421
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:08,680
Faced with the present situation,

422
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:10,080
what on earth can we do?

423
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,800
Feng Wu has the Phoenix Sword.

424
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
His Highness Jun also pays attention to her.

425
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:16,520
What status can we have

426
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:18,440
in this family later?

427
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:20,640
Yiran.

428
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:22,440
Go to ask about

429
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,080
the enrollment time of the Junwu Academy.

430
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:27,000
If Feng Wu

431
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,240
also wants to go there,

432
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:29,880
you must try your best to be admitted, too.

433
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:31,960
But I have learned there for a year.

434
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:33,880
It's just because
you don't have enough cultivation base

435
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:35,200
that

436
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:37,520
Feng Wu got the Phoenix Sword.

437
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:39,680
Well, mom.

438
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:55,640
Having come to the capital
as Jun Linyuan suggested,

439
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:57,520
what should I do next?

440
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:02,440
No.

441
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:03,960
I can't think of him anymore.

442
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:06,360
Master's matter is more important.

443
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:12,560
Those affectionate people
are easily hurt by those indifferent.

444
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:14,080
Having taken in Wanyou Fire,

445
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:16,240
you can come out randomly.
But don't frighten me, OK?

446
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,040
This is the Feng's Mansion.

447
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:19,640
Don't talk randomly.

448
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:22,520
As a spirit animal,
I know human emotions very well.

449
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,680
I just saw that
you were bothered by girl's load.

450
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:27,200
What are you talking about?

451
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:30,240
By the way,

452
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:32,080
what should I do next?

453
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:34,880
To what degree should I cultivate

454
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,480
to wake up my master?

455
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:38,480
Well,

456
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:40,400
it's a top secret.

457
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:42,600
Now that you've been here,

458
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:44,240
it's certain that
you will experience something good or bad.

459
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:47,000
You just need to wait patiently.

460
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:48,240
What are the good and bad things?

461
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:49,400
Make it clear.

462
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:54,480
Don't keep me guessing.

463
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:56,480
Fulfill your character setting, OK?

464
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:58,160
Didn't you tell me that

465
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:00,200
you know human emotions very well?

466
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:03,320
Hey.

467
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:04,600
Hey.

468
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,160
Liar.

469
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:18,120
My Lady, why do we come out?

470
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:21,760
Go shopping and get familiar with
the environment of the capital.

471
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:25,240
Sir, give me two strings.

472
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:26,640
OK. Wait a moment.

473
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,400
-Give it back to me.
-Here.

474
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:31,040
This way. This way.

475
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,560
Give it back to me.

476
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:34,600
My Lady.

477
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:38,640
Give it back to me.
It took me great effort to sew it.

478
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:41,560
I just want to teach you a lesson.

479
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:44,720
You promised to do things for us
but broke your words later.

480
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:46,000
Besides,

481
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,120
you stopped us from hunting in the suburbs.

482
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:49,320
How detestable you are!

483
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:51,560
I've told you the spirit animals
don't do evil.

484
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:53,080
You can't hunt and kill them randomly.

485
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:55,280
It's no use complaining about this.

486
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:56,680
Since you want to have money,

487
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:58,400
just come up with a way by yourself.

488
00:28:58,640 --> 00:28:59,640
Give it back to me.

489
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:02,840
You think what you did is justifiable, right?

490
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:06,200
Cultivators can't use their cultivation base
to hurt common people, right?

491
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:08,000
-Come to get it.
-Yeah.

492
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:09,720
Give it back to me!

493
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:10,920
Give it back to me.

494
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:13,160
What are you doing?

495
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:14,800
It's none of your business.

496
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:15,560
Give me.

497
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:18,120
Loosen your grip.

498
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:19,080
Loosen your grip. It hurts.

499
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:20,600
You...

500
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:26,320
Unexpectedly, you're also a cultivator.

501
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:28,160
If I see you bully others again,

502
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:30,160
I won't forgive you.

503
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:32,720
Did you hear

504
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:33,680
what she said?

505
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:36,760
-Yes.
-Let's go.

506
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:44,640
Here you are.

507
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:45,960
Be careful next time.

508
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:49,120
Feng Wu.

509
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
You know me?

510
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:54,080
Eventually you're back.

511
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:58,800
Feng Wu.

512
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:02,000
My Lady, she is Zhao Ge.

513
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:08,560
Feng Wu.

514
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:11,760
Here are your noodles.

515
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:13,680
Put them here.

516
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,000
Zhao Ge.

517
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:21,280
Eat slowly.

518
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:22,680
I will order more for you.

519
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:31,800
Sir.

520
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,240
I want to order two good cakes.

521
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:34,360
OK.

522
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,560
Did I really know her?

523
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:41,040
You always played with each other
when you were young.

524
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:43,480
Though

525
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:44,920
she is twice her former size,

526
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:46,600
she is really Zhao Ge.

527
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:51,080
Zhao Ge was the daughter
of the master of Celestial Palace.

528
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:53,320
Being slow-witted,

529
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,160
she was given up by her family.

530
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:07,240
Is it painful? Let me hold you.

531
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:09,960
Thank you!

532
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:13,320
With common interests,
you became good friends

533
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:14,720
and often played with each other.

534
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:19,520
Why was she so fat?

535
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,280
In order to save you, she became so.

536
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:22,680
Save me?

537
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:28,560
After your father passed away,

538
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:31,120
several forces surged around
to scramble for power and wealth.

539
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:33,160
As a female genius,

540
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:35,280
it's hard for you to avoid being envied.

541
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:37,960
Others tried every means to kill you.

542
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:40,200
Many years had passed. One day...

543
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:43,400
Zhao Ge.

544
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:51,680
Why are you eating secretly again?

545
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:10,960
Zhao Ge.

546
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:12,080
Zhao Ge.

547
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:13,280
-Zhao Ge
-Miss Zhao Ge.

548
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:14,120
Unintentionally,

549
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:16,040
she ate the cakes on your table

550
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:17,480
and was poisoned instead of you.

551
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:19,200
Then she became what she's like now.

552
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:20,840
So

553
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:22,280
she was poisoned

554
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:23,240
and became so because of me, right?

555
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:25,560
It was said that it was a strange poison
beyond the Great Wall.

556
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:26,640
It's rarely seen.

557
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:28,880
The Feng Family
looked into it for three days,

558
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:30,920
only to find nothing.

559
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:33,560
It ended up with nothing definite.

560
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:38,360
After being poisoned,

561
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:39,680
Zhao Ge went back to the Celestial Palace.

562
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,760
But nobody paid attention to her there.

563
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:45,760
Only you treated her as before.

564
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:48,680
Later we had misfortune,

565
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,360
went back to the old house of the Feng Family

566
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:51,800
and never saw her again.

567
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:55,600
Unexpectedly, we met her here.

568
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:01,840
What's up, Wu?

569
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:03,960
Is it because
I have eaten up all the noodles?

570
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:06,920
If you want to eat, I can share with you.

571
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:08,800
Just eat.

572
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:11,880
If they're not enough, I will order more.

573
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:15,200
Then I will eat them.

574
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:29,760
Wu, do you still remember this?

575
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:31,240
You gave it to me.

576
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:08,840
Zhao Ge, this is for you.

577
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:12,240
Thank you, Feng Wu. I love it so much.

578
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:13,600
You're welcome.

579
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:26,040
It doesn't matter if you forget it.

580
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:28,000
After all, many years have passed.

581
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,000
In this period,

582
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:32,710
you've suffered much, right?

583
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:34,560
No. No.

584
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:36,360
I have been to many places,

585
00:34:36,670 --> 00:34:37,920
knowing lots of people.

586
00:34:38,630 --> 00:34:40,150
My life is colorful.

587
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,400
But without you,

588
00:34:42,670 --> 00:34:44,960
I didn't know who I could share

589
00:34:45,190 --> 00:34:46,670
lots of delicious food
and interesting things with.

590
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,280
I felt a little lonely.

591
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:54,960
Well, it doesn't matter.

592
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:57,840
I've written them down here.

593
00:34:58,190 --> 00:34:59,920
If you're still interested

594
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:02,360
and would like to listen...

595
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:03,480
I'd like to.

596
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:04,920
As long as you'd like to say,

597
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:06,040
I'm all ears.

598
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:12,440
Wu. Wu.

599
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:14,880
I miss you so much.

600
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:47,600
Congratulations. Young Master.

601
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:49,360
Having cultivated alone for these days,

602
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:51,800
you've really made much progress
in your spirit energy.

603
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:54,400
It's just a small achievement.

604
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:56,960
To deal with Jun Linyuan,

605
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:58,960
it's far from enough.

606
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:01,680
Young Master, don't underestimate yourself.

607
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,080
Among the younger generation,

608
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:05,800
you're already very powerful.

609
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:10,920
I, Yu Mingye,

610
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:12,640
can only be number one.

611
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:14,440
I can't be number two.

612
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:16,280
By the way,

613
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:18,200
has Junwu Academy started to

614
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:19,800
admit students this year?

615
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:22,480
Usually, it starts during these two months.

616
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:23,680
Prepare for it.

617
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:26,280
I will take part in it this year.

618
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:28,440
Young Master,

619
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,160
why?

620
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:35,400
In this way, I can closely get
the information of the Junwu Clan

621
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:37,320
and

622
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:40,800
figure out the plan of Lord Demon.

623
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,920
But Great Spiritual Master
can be admitted without examination.

624
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:45,040
You can just go there directly. Young Master.

625
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:46,840
Since I have decided to learn there,

626
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:48,840
in the martial art examination,

627
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:52,000
I'd better get to know
the skill of other disciples.

628
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:02,800
It is still the same as before.

629
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:03,760
From today on,

630
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:05,360
if you like, just come and stay here.

631
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:07,200
And we can also chat with each other.

632
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:09,320
Will it trouble you?

633
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:11,720
If you keep talking like this,
I won't talk with you.

634
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:14,040
OK. I won't say that.

635
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:17,400
This five-treasure azalea is hard to get.

636
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:18,960
You're really thoughtful.

637
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:22,000
I love it very much.

638
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:23,800
I'm glad that you like it. Your Majesty.

639
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:25,480
I saw it on my way back to the capital

640
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:27,120
from the Celestial Palace.

641
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:28,600
I remember

642
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:31,040
there used to be a pot of azalea
in your resting place.

643
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:32,760
Caring for it very well,

644
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:35,080
you must like it very much.

645
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,640
So, I took this pot here.

646
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:38,880
Good girl.

647
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:40,680
Thank you for thinking of me all the time.

648
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:42,000
Sit down.

649
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:50,040
Why did you go back to
the Celestial Palace this time?

650
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:59,160
I have a Junior Sister

651
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:00,680
who was poisoned by a strange poison

652
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:02,800
and became swollen with a big appetite,

653
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:04,440
which bothers her very much.

654
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,720
I have been seeking antidote for her,

655
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:08,640
only to have no progress.

656
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:10,560
I went back to the Celestial Palace,

657
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:13,400
hoping to find some clues in
the ancient books and records in the palace

658
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:16,120
to see if I can detoxify for her.

659
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:20,520
I have also heard of
the poison you mentioned.

660
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:24,520
It did make a stir in the capital then.

661
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:26,680
It's a pity that it's rarely seen.

662
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:28,360
All the doctors

663
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,320
feel helpless.

664
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:33,760
I'm so happy to meet you.

665
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:35,920
When did you become so good at cooking?

666
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:37,080
Have a taste.

667
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:41,560
Madam, you first.

668
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:44,760
Zhao Ge. You haven't been here
for a long time.

669
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:46,400
Don't be ill at ease. Help yourself.

670
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:48,760
OK. Let's eat together.

671
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:56,960
Oh, Zhao Ge. You're awesome.

672
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:59,360
Where have the five bowls of noodles gone?

673
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,480
Since I was poisoned,

674
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:03,960
I have never felt that I am full.

675
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:06,440
Isn't there a way to detoxify it?

676
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:07,280
Yes.

677
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:09,680
It's said that
among the treasures of Peerless Tower,

678
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:12,360
there is Heavenly Heart Pistil
which can detoxify any kind of poison.

679
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:15,520
But I am not qualified
to make a breakthrough.

680
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:17,400
It doesn't matter. I have been used to it.

681
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,320
Peerless Tower?

682
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:21,720
Don't you know it?

683
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,200
The Peerless Tower of the capital

684
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:24,240
is said

685
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:26,040
to be an independent organization,
drifting out of the Junwu Clan

686
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:28,360
and the other three great sects.

687
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:30,240
Usually it is just a restaurant.

688
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:31,880
Only influential officials can go inside.

689
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,160
The breakthrough day falls on
the fifteenth day of each lunar month.

690
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:36,000
With skilled men guarding each floor,

691
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:37,800
challengers need to defeat all of them

692
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:38,760
to reach the top.

693
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:39,520
And then?

694
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:41,440
Then the successful challenger
can have the reward.

695
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:44,440
As long as you can break through successfully,
you can get the treasures.

696
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:45,640
But

697
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:46,960
so far,

698
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:49,680
nobody had made it.

699
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:52,520
Last time I went there,

700
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:54,080
I saw a six-feet tall man

701
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:56,440
failed to break through the first floor

702
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:58,760
and was carried out
with blood all over his body.

703
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:06,080
It's said that the food there
is extremely expensive,

704
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:08,000
just because of this mysterious background.

705
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:11,600
I'm wondering how the food tastes there.

706
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,720
However, it won't be tastier
than the food made by you.

707
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:18,600
Eat more.

708
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:19,840
OK.

709
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:24,080
