[Episode 10]

4
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:34,400
I'll give you two more days.

5
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:35,830
No more lies.

6
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:36,630
Alright.

7
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:52,040
Your Honor.

8
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:54,230
Excuse me, Dr. Hua.

9
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,360
We'd like to ask you something.

10
00:01:56,830 --> 00:01:58,440
We still have some doubts
about the case.

11
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:00,120
We need to investigate.

12
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:06,480
Okay. I'll tell everything I know.

13
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:07,510
Please.

14
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:08,440
It's okay.

15
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:09,880
We just want to know

16
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:11,440
when did you start

17
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,910
treating the Qiao family?

18
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,240
Well,

19
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,750
Shenwei and I used to be neighbors.

20
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,830
We go way back.

21
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,800
Then he married Qiao Ruhui,

22
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
so he moved to Qiao Mansion.

23
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,670
But he didn't forget his old friend.

24
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,600
He recommended me to be the doctor here.

25
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:33,390
I heard that Qiao Ruhui got pregnant

26
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:35,270
because of your extraordinary skills.

27
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:37,440
I can't take that credit.

28
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:38,630
I just happened to have

29
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:39,910
a family heirloom prescription.

30
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:41,190
Mrs. Qiao

31
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:42,670
really wanted to have a baby,

32
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,000
so she tried my prescription.

33
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:45,520
She really got pregnant.

34
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:49,030
After that,

35
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:50,270
they both trusted me a lot,

36
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:51,630
so I officially became

37
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:52,880
the doctor of the Qiao family.

38
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:56,390
It's just too bad that

39
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:57,830
she couldn't keep the baby alive.

40
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,190
After the miscarriage,

41
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:01,360
Mrs. Qiao fell seriously ill.

42
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:03,670
I had been helping her recover.

43
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:05,670
She had been through a lot.

44
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,270
She was very weak,

45
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:08,360
and the loss of her baby

46
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:11,110
caused the depression
and stagnation of qi.

47
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:13,600
She passed away.

48
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:20,160
Your prescription is so effective.

49
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:21,470
I'm sure many people

50
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:22,630
have come to you, right?

51
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:23,720
Yes.

52
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,240
Did that lady get pregnant

53
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:27,470
because of your prescription?

54
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:28,550
She...

55
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:29,880
No.

56
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:31,240
She's my cousin.

57
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:33,320
Her husband's family
has been through a hard time

58
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:34,520
and she needs money.

59
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:35,670
So,

60
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:37,160
she came to borrow money
for an emergency.

61
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,670
Do you believe it now?

62
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,670
Qiao Ruhui did die of illness.

63
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:46,470
Her fiery sister

64
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:47,360
accused her brother-in-law

65
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,910
of murdering for money for no reason.

66
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:50,030
That's ridiculous.

67
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:51,600
Think about it.

68
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,270
He Shenwei and his wife

69
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:54,360
were living well

70
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,520
with no worries about life.

71
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,600
Their relationship was also good.

72
00:03:56,830 --> 00:03:58,190
Why would he take the risk to do this?

73
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,190
How would

74
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:00,320
the death of his wife benefit him?

75
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:02,240
He's just a scholar.

76
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,240
He doesn't know how to run

77
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:04,240
a liquor distillery alone.

78
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,440
Even if he got it,

79
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,750
would his life be better?

80
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:08,270
Don't you think

81
00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:10,030
Hua Miao is a bit strange?

82
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:14,390
Haven't you noticed

83
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:15,880
anything suspicious at all?

84
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:17,510
No.

85
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:18,390
In your eyes,

86
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:19,200
everything is wrong.

87
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:20,320
Do you really think

88
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,440
Hua Miao and that woman

89
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,200
are cousins?

90
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:22,830
Yes.

91
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,320
Alright.

92
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:25,950
Hua Miao said

93
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:27,440
his cousin needed money

94
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,830
and came to borrow from him.

95
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,110
But that woman

96
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:31,040
was wearing fine jewelry

97
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,510
and clothes made of superior material.

98
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,510
If she really needs money badly,

99
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:35,880
why did she borrow from her cousin

100
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:36,440
instead of

101
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:37,830
pawning her own belongings?

102
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:50,790
Maybe she would prefer

103
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:51,790
to ask people for help

104
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:53,000
rather than suffer herself.

105
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:54,920
Even if she doesn't want to
pawn her possessions,

106
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,200
have you ever seen people borrow money

107
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:56,920
with such confidence

108
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,070
and threats?

109
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,760
It looks like she came to ask for money.

110
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,550
I'm confident.

111
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:05,600
Wait.

112
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:08,000
Even if Hua Miao was lying

113
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:09,640
and that woman came to ask for money,

114
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:10,790
it doesn't prove anything.

115
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,320
He was saving his face

116
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:13,110
and didn't want people

117
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:14,070
to know that he owed money.

118
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,040
It shows that Hua Miao is dishonest.

119
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,640
How can you believe his words?

120
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:19,070
Fine, I'm not arguing with you.

121
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,790
You always have your reasons.

122
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,920
Even if Hua Miao was lying,

123
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,230
it has nothing to do

124
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:27,830
with He Shenwei and the Qiao family.

125
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,000
[To Ruolan]

126
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:06,110
Please wait a second.

127
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,790
You're really putting on airs.

128
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:10,230
Instead of sending letters to yamen,

129
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:10,880
you asked us

130
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:11,920
to pick them up ourselves.

131
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:13,720
That's true.

132
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,920
These letters for me

133
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:16,720
are really precious

134
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,880
left by my sister.

135
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,440
If you were in my shoes,

136
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,440
would you just give them to somebody?

137
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:23,200
No, no.

138
00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:24,550
It makes sense.

139
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:26,270
It's not that far

140
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:27,160
from yamen to here.

141
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:29,440
We can wait outside

142
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,320
for a while.

143
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,110
It's okay.

144
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:32,600
Come in.

145
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:40,720
I've organized these letters

146
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,760
in chronological order.

147
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:44,040
You can read them.

148
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:45,440
Okay.

149
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,760
I only show

150
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:56,320
these letters

151
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,760
to Chief Luo.

152
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,040
Besides,

153
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:00,270
I'm not used to

154
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:01,760
having other men in my room.

155
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,110
Why is it so

156
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:11,830
stuffy in here?

157
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,720
It smells.

158
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:16,670
I'll go for a walk.

159
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:20,550
Alright.

160
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:21,950
Less distractions.

161
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:44,000
You have a lot of

162
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:44,920
intimate conversations.

163
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:47,040
A single letter can be so long.

164
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,440
Every time I wrote to my sister,

165
00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:51,110
we always had a lot to share,

166
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:52,110
as if

167
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:53,510
she were by my side.

168
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:04,110
Has your sister received any education?

169
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:06,790
Sure. How could she write
if she not?

170
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:08,480
I mean,

171
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,200
did she like reading poetry?

172
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,200
How about her writing skills?

173
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:13,640
She hasn't read a lot of poetry.

174
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,040
She just knew how to write, read,
and do accounting.

175
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:19,550
The dew on leeks,
so fragile, so fleeting.

176
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:21,550
It vanishes at dawn,
it will fall again in the morning.

177
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:23,950
But once gone, my wife never returns.

178
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:27,040
You lie buried beneath the springs,
your bones dissolving.

179
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,670
I'm lodging in the world
with snow white hair.

180
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:33,200
Unfortunately, my life is short.

181
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:35,550
Please take care of yourself
and do not grieve.

182
00:08:43,670 --> 00:08:45,110
Did you find something?

183
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:48,030
Let me double-check with you.

184
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:49,760
These letters were wrote

185
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:50,910
before her miscarriage.

186
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:52,550
These were wrote after the miscarriage,

187
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:53,320
right?

188
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:01,590
I'll write a calligraphy for you.

189
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:03,110
I'll definitely use the best...

190
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:04,910
There you are.

191
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:08,880
What do you mean?

192
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:09,910
Of course I'm here.

193
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:10,790
It's comfortable.

194
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:13,280
Chief...

195
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:14,590
Chief Luo?

196
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:16,280
You...

197
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:17,790
You're a female constable.

198
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:19,760
I'm so impressed.

199
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:21,440
Thank you.

200
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:22,760
Well.

201
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:24,470
I just saw the letters

202
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:26,350
Ruhui wrote to Ruolan in Ruolan's room.

203
00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:27,960
I think you might have kept

204
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,200
some letters from Ruolan to Ruhui.

205
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:30,350
Can I take a look?

206
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:34,110
Chief Luo, please wait a second.

207
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,470
I'll go look for them.

208
00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:43,000
He said you're pretty.

209
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:50,840
Here you are.

210
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,520
These weren't written by Ruolan.

211
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:08,960
They're all business letters.

212
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:11,080
I'm very sorry.

213
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:12,520
Those letters

214
00:10:12,590 --> 00:10:14,760
were always kept by Ruhui herself.

215
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,230
I don't know where they are.

216
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:18,110
Our mansion is quite big,

217
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:19,400
and she just passed away.

218
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:21,440
I'm still tidying the place up.

219
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:22,960
It's okay.

220
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,760
Those are private letters.

221
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:25,840
It's normal that you don't know.

222
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:27,110
Yes.

223
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:28,710
Those letters are their secrets.

224
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:29,910
Even though I'm the husband,

225
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:31,550
it's not appropriate for me to know.

226
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:39,710
See.

227
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:40,710
You trust her,

228
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:41,960
but she doesn't trust you.

229
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:45,960
What?

230
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,590
You come here to watch over me?

231
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:48,960
Just to see you off.

232
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:55,840
[Qiao Mansion]
Stop, what are you doing?

233
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:57,200
[Qiao Mansion]
Let me in.

234
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,470
We don't entertain guests today.

235
00:10:58,880 --> 00:10:59,840
I want to see Mr. He.

236
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:00,840
I need to talk to him.

237
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:01,910
You're pregnant.

238
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:02,440
What could you

239
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,230
talk to Mr. He about?

240
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,400
Go away.

241
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:05,790
What's she doing here?

242
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:09,470
Wait.

243
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:12,350
[Qiao Mansion]
Who are you?

244
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:13,760
[Qiao Mansion]
What are you doing here?

245
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,590
What did she say to you?

246
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:21,400
She said she wanted to talk to Mr. He.

247
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:23,960
Wait.

248
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:25,230
Hang on.

249
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:28,030
Who is He Shenwei to you?

250
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:29,790
Who is he to you?

251
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:33,000
Miss Qiao.

252
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:35,470
Qiu.

253
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:36,440
What are you doing here?

254
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:41,590
Miss Qiao, please calm down.

255
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:42,710
You've misunderstood.

256
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,400
She's my cousin.

257
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:45,880
Your cousin?

258
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:49,030
So why is she here

259
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:50,550
looking for He Shenwei?

260
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:53,760
No.

261
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:55,880
She came here to see me.

262
00:11:56,470 --> 00:11:57,590
I told her

263
00:11:57,590 --> 00:11:58,350
that I was coming here

264
00:11:58,350 --> 00:11:59,520
to examine Shenwei.

265
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:01,030
So she accidentally

266
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:02,230
said she came to see Shenwei.

267
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:06,350
You mean she came to our house
to see you?

268
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,150
She came to borrow money from me.

269
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:11,400
They are my witnesses.

270
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,000
Qiu.

271
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:21,440
You are so presumptuous.

272
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:23,110
I told you

273
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:24,400
that you had only two days.

274
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:25,400
But where were you?

275
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:27,150
If you can't do it,

276
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:28,550
I'll have to do it myself.

277
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,550
I'll bring the money to you today.

278
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:32,550
Just go home.

279
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:33,760
Trying to get rid of me again?

280
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:34,550
No way.

281
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:35,320
Today,

282
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,200
the three of us...

283
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:37,640
I am here right now

284
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:38,710
to discuss with Shenwei.

285
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:40,590
You know I'm living on a shoestring.

286
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,080
I don't have extra money for you.

287
00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:43,350
I can only lend you money

288
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:44,550
if Shenwei lends it to me first.

289
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:45,840
Besides,

290
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:46,790
I told you

291
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:47,840
to wait outside the mansion,

292
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,200
not to go in and look for him.

293
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:50,550
Stupid.

294
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:53,280
I'm sorry.

295
00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:55,200
My cousin doesn't know how to behave.

296
00:12:55,470 --> 00:12:56,760
Please forgive her.

297
00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:00,080
You should go back.

298
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,790
It must be inconvenient
for a pregnant woman like you

299
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:02,840
to walk around by yourself.

300
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:03,710
Shenwei will definitely

301
00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:04,470
help me with this.

302
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:05,520
Once I get the money,

303
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:06,590
I'll send it to you immediately.

304
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,150
Don't embarrass yourself.

305
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:09,840
No.

306
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:12,840
Since you're here,

307
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,440
let's just wait for He Shenwei
to come out

308
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,710
and we'll clear things up.

309
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,320
Come on,

310
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:18,550
she's pregnant.

311
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:19,200
If you hurt the baby,

312
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:19,910
can you handle it?

313
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:21,150
Mind your own business.

314
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:21,880
Ruolan.

315
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:23,230
Dr. Hua

316
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:24,550
has already explained it clearly.

317
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:26,030
Don't make it complicated.

318
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:27,440
Trust me.

319
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:33,590
I'll just go.

320
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:45,400
I just can't stand

321
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:46,550
when she bullies people,

322
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:48,080
being so aggressive.

323
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:49,760
Look what she did to a pregnant woman.

324
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:50,790
You still protect her.

325
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,440
What are you thinking about every day?

326
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:53,590
You can't tell right from wrong!

327
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,400
Could you stop nagging?

328
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:56,670
Leave me in peace.

329
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:57,960
Do you even

330
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:58,880
think of me as a friend?

331
00:13:59,000 --> 00:13:59,470
Can you

332
00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:00,790
listen to your friend seriously?

333
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:02,320
I truly treat you

334
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,080
as a close friend,

335
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,320
but you always brush me off.

336
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:08,110
Alright, I'm really sorry.

337
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:09,840
Listen,

338
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,710
stop investigating this case,

339
00:14:11,710 --> 00:14:13,590
or I won't think of you
as a friend anymore.

340
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:16,150
Can you stop

341
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:17,470
acting like a child?

342
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,200
You're being childish.

343
00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:20,470
Are you gonna help her

344
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:21,440
even if she betrays you?

345
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:22,550
I'm really confused.

346
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:24,400
How can you not distinguish
right from wrong?

347
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:25,150
What?

348
00:14:25,150 --> 00:14:25,640
What has she

349
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:26,550
done to you?

350
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:27,910
I'm telling you,

351
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,400
if you keep helping her with this case,

352
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:32,320
I'll cut ties with you.

353
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:40,960
Miss Luo,

354
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:43,470
that thing you asked me
to inquire about,

355
00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:44,230
I found out.

356
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:45,320
How is it?

357
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,350
Three months ago,

358
00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:47,280
He Shenwei

359
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:48,200
did donate to the temple

360
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,000
a certain amount of money.

361
00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:50,150
He did?

362
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:51,880
Yes, but not two hundred liang.

363
00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:53,350
It was fifty liang.

364
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:54,710
It's all over.

365
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:55,880
It's all over.

366
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,550
Now she knows about Qiu.

367
00:14:58,350 --> 00:14:59,440
Qiu is so stupid.

368
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:01,000
She shouldn't have come.

369
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:02,080
A few days ago,

370
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:02,590
I asked you

371
00:15:02,590 --> 00:15:03,840
to give her money for monthly expenses

372
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,000
and she already spent it all?

373
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:07,470
He Shenwei has always been punctual.

374
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:09,200
Did you pocket the money?

375
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:10,910
Of course not.

376
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:13,280
I care about your life.

377
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:14,110
I also

378
00:15:14,110 --> 00:15:15,470
care about the baby.

379
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,030
Now

380
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:18,110
you care about the baby, huh?

381
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:19,320
I'm telling you,

382
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,670
if the baby gets hungry

383
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:22,000
or anything goes wrong,

384
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,000
you don't expect me

385
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:23,670
for cooperation.

386
00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:24,760
Chase rainbows by yourself.

387
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:28,110
Everything was going well.

388
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:29,760
Qiao Ruolan ruined it.

389
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,150
It's been taken to court.

390
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:34,910
Pick it up.

391
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:39,640
Pick it up.

392
00:15:52,590 --> 00:15:53,910
Calm down.

393
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,520
If you expose weaknesses,

394
00:15:57,030 --> 00:15:58,230
you'll clean up the mess yourself.

395
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:01,520
Hua.

396
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:04,840
In a couple of months,

397
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:06,590
Qiu is due to give birth.

398
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:07,470
I...

399
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,590
I'm so anxious.

400
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,520
We haven't got the secret recipe yet.

401
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:14,030
Right now,

402
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:15,710
we have to be patient.

403
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:23,030
We've come this far.

404
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:25,080
Can't you just be more patient?

405
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:26,790
Once we get through this,

406
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:28,110
we'll be able to live

407
00:16:28,110 --> 00:16:29,280
a comfortable life in the future.

408
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:29,960
Stop it.

409
00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:31,910
Don't talk to me about the future.

410
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:33,000
I can hardly

411
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,030
make ends meet now.

412
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:35,590
Solve the current problem right now.

413
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:41,110
Qiu is indeed

414
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:42,350
very constrained financially.

415
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,470
How about you giving her some money

416
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:45,230
to calm her down?

417
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:48,200
You know that

418
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,030
Qiao Ruolan is always

419
00:16:49,030 --> 00:16:50,670
watching over the accountant.

420
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,320
I have no reason

421
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,440
to withdraw money.

422
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:56,280
Well...

423
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:58,150
do you have anything valuable?

424
00:16:58,350 --> 00:16:59,670
You can go to pawn it.

425
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:01,080
I have nothing valuable

426
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:02,550
right now.

427
00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:08,400
Ruihui had a pair of bracelets,

428
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:09,920
but it won't work.

429
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:11,110
If Qiao Ruolan finds out,

430
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:12,590
it'll be even harder for me to explain.

431
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Although the ruling
for the liquor distillery

432
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,070
has already been issued,

433
00:17:18,430 --> 00:17:20,000
we haven't got the secret recipe.

434
00:17:21,350 --> 00:17:22,710
I'm working on it.

435
00:17:23,190 --> 00:17:24,520
We can't fail now.

436
00:17:24,830 --> 00:17:26,560
What if you can't get the recipe?

437
00:17:27,110 --> 00:17:27,950
I can't waste

438
00:17:27,950 --> 00:17:28,920
any more time on this.

439
00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:30,800
I'll have to walk in

440
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:31,880
through the front door
of the Qiao Mansion

441
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:33,070
and ask him
to acknowledge me and my baby.

442
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:35,350
She's been experiencing
fetal movements these days,

443
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:36,830
so she's been emotional lately.

444
00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:39,430
Last night, she was seeking death,

445
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:41,040
saying you abandoned her

446
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:41,920
and the baby,

447
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:43,640
and there was no point
in living anymore.

448
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:44,640
How could I

449
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,880
abandon her?

450
00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:46,760
Hua,

451
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,160
please calm her down.

452
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:50,000
What should I do?

453
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:50,950
What...

454
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,000
Help me.

455
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:56,110
Well,

456
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:57,190
there is a way,

457
00:17:58,680 --> 00:17:59,760
as long as you are willing to do it.

458
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:02,110
You need to be patient,

459
00:18:02,710 --> 00:18:04,110
and then you'll be rich,

460
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:06,000
with a lot of money.

461
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:15,950
All this started because of Ruolan,

462
00:18:18,190 --> 00:18:20,680
so why don't we get rid of her?

463
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:22,400
Why can't I

464
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,160
control myself?

465
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:25,590
I even said I'd cut ties with her.

466
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:27,310
I really should have
talked to her nicely.

467
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:28,680
I just left her there

468
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:29,800
and came back.

469
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:30,230
It's because

470
00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:31,920
Chief Luo has a good temper.

471
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,310
She has a good temper?

472
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:34,830
You are not regretful enough.

473
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:36,230
I...

474
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:57,640
Chief Luo.

475
00:18:58,190 --> 00:18:58,830
Luo Shu.

476
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:00,190
Miss Luo.

477
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:01,400
What?

478
00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:03,160
Could you open the door?

479
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,110
I want to talk to you.

480
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:05,800
I'm going to sleep.

481
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:08,310
Right.

482
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,160
It's not convenient

483
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,560
for a young lady at night.

484
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:13,470
I understand.

485
00:19:18,430 --> 00:19:20,040
Please open the door.

486
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:21,000
I just want to

487
00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:22,310
say one thing and I'll leave,

488
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,040
or I can't sleep tonight.

489
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:25,070
Say it tomorrow.

490
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:31,470
Hey,

491
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:33,040
you're not asleep yet.

492
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,560
I didn't mean it during the day.

493
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:39,310
I just...

494
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:42,880
can't stand seeing the evil in charge

495
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:43,920
and the weak being bullied.

496
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,000
Mr. He is so kind-hearted

497
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:47,800
and has a deep affection for his wife.

498
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:48,920
But Qiao Ruolan

499
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:49,880
not only shouted abuse at him

500
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:50,880
but also hit him.

501
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,640
I also can't bear

502
00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:54,800
what she has done to that woman today.

503
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:56,000
In spite of her relationship

504
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,280
with Mr. He,

505
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,430
she's still pregnant.

506
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:00,950
I see.

507
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:02,950
Mr. Qi, please go to bed.

508
00:20:03,430 --> 00:20:04,640
Let me finish.

509
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,560
So facing someone like Qiao Ruolan,

510
00:20:08,590 --> 00:20:09,590
I really can't bear it.

511
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,040
Don't you think

512
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:12,800
we should help the weak
and punish the evil?

513
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:14,760
I'll tell you a secret.

514
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:16,400
This time,

515
00:20:16,430 --> 00:20:17,880
I set a goal for myself

516
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:20,000
to complete ten

517
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,190
chivalrous deeds.

518
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:22,640
I've completed the first one

519
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:23,560
soon after arriving in Linfen.

520
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:25,160
Mingke House.

521
00:20:25,310 --> 00:20:26,470
Do you know that place?

522
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:27,800
The ladies there

523
00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:29,230
are all as beautiful as flowers,

524
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,280
and fairy-like.

525
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:35,400
I'm gonna sleep.

526
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,040
You should leave.

527
00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:38,880
Mingke House.

528
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,000
Don't you know about Mingke House?

529
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,520
It's the most famous place of ill repute
in Linfen.

530
00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:43,160
I did something

531
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,430
earth-shattering there.

532
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:45,160
To prevent

533
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,280
an old man from succeeding,

534
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:47,110
I spent five hundred liang,

535
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:47,470
no,

536
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:48,800
five hundred and one liang,

537
00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:50,110
to bid for

538
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:51,350
the deflowering night

539
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:53,520
of the top beauty there, named Jin Nang.

540
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:56,680
What are you doing?

541
00:20:59,230 --> 00:21:00,160
What happened?

542
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:01,520
I didn't say anything wrong.

543
00:21:02,430 --> 00:21:02,920
Did you

544
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:03,680
misunderstand me?

545
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,230
It's natural that
talented gentlemen all go there.

546
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:09,640
I'm not finished yet.

547
00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:13,000
Open the door.

548
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:14,430
Why are you angry?

549
00:21:15,230 --> 00:21:16,710
Miss Luo, please open the door.

550
00:21:18,230 --> 00:21:19,000
Luo Shu.

551
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,280
I'm not finished...

552
00:21:21,310 --> 00:21:22,310
I was just closing the window.
I'm not angry.

553
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:24,400
Alright. You bid for

554
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,830
Jin Nang's deflowering night,

555
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:26,710
and then?

556
00:21:27,310 --> 00:21:28,590
I'll continue.

557
00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:30,190
This young lady Jin Nang

558
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:31,190
is breathtakingly

559
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:32,230
and devastatingly beautiful.

560
00:21:32,310 --> 00:21:33,310
She's the top performer there.

561
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:34,680
She plays the pipa skillfully.

562
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:36,280
It sounds like pearls
cascading on a jade plate.

563
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:37,190
It's amazing.

564
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:39,160
With such a charming lady,

565
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,310
how can I let her fall into

566
00:21:40,310 --> 00:21:41,950
the hands of that ugly, sneaky old man?

567
00:21:41,950 --> 00:21:42,830
So I spared no expense

568
00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:44,110
to snatch her deflowering night

569
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:45,590
from that old rascal.

570
00:21:46,230 --> 00:21:46,710
After that,

571
00:21:46,710 --> 00:21:47,950
I went to visit Jin Nang.

572
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:49,000
That's when I found out

573
00:21:49,310 --> 00:21:51,520
Jin Nang was all dolled up

574
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:52,590
in her wedding dress.

575
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:53,560
Turns out the deflowering night

576
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:55,350
is a woman's wedding night.

577
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:58,070
But I only stepped in

578
00:21:58,070 --> 00:21:58,920
to help the underdog.

579
00:21:59,190 --> 00:22:01,000
I didn't mean to take advantage of her.

580
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:01,680
Jin Nang

581
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:02,640
was very moved

582
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:03,640
after learning my intentions.

583
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:04,830
She played a piece

584
00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:05,710
for me alone on the spot,

585
00:22:05,710 --> 00:22:06,880
The Interrupted Dream.

586
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:09,880
Love once begun,

587
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:10,880
will never end.

588
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:12,590
I understand

589
00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:13,520
Jin Nang's feelings too.

590
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:14,640
But

591
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:15,680
a gentleman

592
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,190
shouldn't take advantage of a lady.

593
00:22:18,830 --> 00:22:20,190
This Jin Nang you mentioned

594
00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:21,470
seems to be wonderful.

595
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:23,280
Why don't you bring her over sometime?

596
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:24,560
I'd like to meet her.

597
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:30,400
You're so rude.

598
00:22:34,830 --> 00:22:36,190
I'll invite her out tomorrow.

599
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:37,190
You keep the appointment.

600
00:22:39,230 --> 00:22:40,230
I'll let you know.

601
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:44,020
[Qiao Mansion]

602
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:49,070
Chief Luo?

603
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,040
I'm looking for Ruolan.

604
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:52,590
She's gone to see you.

605
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:54,430
I haven't seen her.

606
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,000
Wait,

607
00:22:56,230 --> 00:22:57,520
didn't you deliver a message,

608
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:58,920
telling her to meet you by the river?

609
00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:01,680
Oh, no.

610
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:21,590
Ruolan, run!

611
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:23,880
Wait, stop!

612
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:25,560
Stop, don't run!

613
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:26,430
Stop.

614
00:23:27,070 --> 00:23:27,880
Hurry up!

615
00:23:29,310 --> 00:23:30,470
Stop!

616
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:31,470
Stop!

617
00:23:31,470 --> 00:23:32,230
Go to yamen for help!

618
00:23:32,350 --> 00:23:32,880
Okay.

619
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:35,430
Stop.

620
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:45,040
Luo Shu.

621
00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:49,280
Trying to escape, huh?

622
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:50,280
Don't move.

623
00:24:07,830 --> 00:24:08,520
I guess

624
00:24:08,590 --> 00:24:10,590
since you're from the big city,

625
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:11,640
you may not

626
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:12,800
fancy me.

627
00:24:13,110 --> 00:24:14,950
Don't you like

628
00:24:14,950 --> 00:24:16,400
the rest of ladies either?

629
00:24:16,710 --> 00:24:17,800
No, that's not true.

630
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:19,110
They're all great.

631
00:24:21,070 --> 00:24:22,880
You're here for Jin Nang, aren't you?

632
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:25,680
Last time you missed her.

633
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,040
Can't get her out of your mind?

634
00:24:27,310 --> 00:24:28,560
No.

635
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:29,520
No, I'm not.

636
00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:32,590
Jin Nang is so lucky.

637
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,040
There's always someone to help her out.

638
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:36,590
You spent a fortune on her,

639
00:24:36,710 --> 00:24:38,230
then she ran away
on her deflowering night.

640
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:40,520
She was supposed to be punished,

641
00:24:40,950 --> 00:24:42,800
but a nobleman suddenly appeared

642
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:43,800
and offered to redeem her.

643
00:24:44,710 --> 00:24:45,950
Do you know

644
00:24:45,950 --> 00:24:46,830
where she went?

645
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:50,000
I heard the noble man
has set his sights on her.

646
00:24:50,310 --> 00:24:52,310
Maybe she's already married.

647
00:24:56,230 --> 00:24:59,920
That sounds pretty good, too.

648
00:25:00,950 --> 00:25:02,230
Actually, it's not me

649
00:25:02,230 --> 00:25:03,800
who wants to see Jin Nang.

650
00:25:04,190 --> 00:25:05,800
I promised a friend of mine

651
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:06,680
who wanted to meet her.

652
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:09,640
Jin Nang isn't here,

653
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:11,230
but you have
the Five Beauties of Mingke.

654
00:25:12,190 --> 00:25:13,230
Peony

655
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:15,110
is the top beauty in Mingke House.

656
00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:18,520
No wonder her name is Peony.

657
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:22,880
What about the others?

658
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,760
Bai Yubei has porcelain skin
[*White Jade Cup]

659
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:26,190
and she can drink all night long.

660
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,560
Shan Zhui has a petite figure.
[*The pendant of a fan]

661
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:30,680
Mian Ao is the sweetest lady here.
[*Little Cotton Jacket]

662
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:32,230
She's popular among guests.

663
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:36,920
That's true, so sweet.

664
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:40,710
What about you?

665
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,160
Is Jin Lian your real name?
[*tiny feet as golden lotuses]

666
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,800
This nickname

667
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:45,400
is naturally because of my small feet.

668
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:49,350
What about Jin Nang?

669
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:51,680
Jin Nang got her name

670
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:53,560
because she's good at solving problems.

671
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:54,950
She always has brilliant ideas.

672
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:59,400
If she were here today,

673
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,760
she could definitely
cheer you up.

674
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:07,470
I guess I just don't have the fate

675
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:09,190
to meet Jin Nang.

676
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:16,830
Bro, this one is not bad.

677
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:18,400
We can sell her for a good price.

678
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:20,640
It's perfect today.

679
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:22,920
Shall we follow the old rules?

680
00:26:23,350 --> 00:26:25,190
Strip her first.

681
00:26:28,310 --> 00:26:29,680
If White Fan knows

682
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:31,350
we've kidnapped one more person,

683
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:33,470
he might blame us.

684
00:26:33,950 --> 00:26:35,190
Just kill her.

685
00:26:37,070 --> 00:26:38,430
She's not a person,

686
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:39,230
she is...

687
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:40,680
she is a treasure to us.

688
00:26:42,830 --> 00:26:44,070
You're from the White Ant.

689
00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:47,310
You know quite a bit about us.

690
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,520
Who in Linfen hasn't heard about you?

691
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:51,350
It's all about the money, right?

692
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:53,430
We're willing to pay.

693
00:26:53,830 --> 00:26:55,230
You speak boldly.

694
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,680
My brother works at the county yamen.

695
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,160
If something happens to me,

696
00:26:59,590 --> 00:27:00,710
he'll plead with the magistrate

697
00:27:00,710 --> 00:27:01,520
to investigate.

698
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,160
But if you let me go,

699
00:27:03,470 --> 00:27:04,680
I'll give you what you want.

700
00:27:06,350 --> 00:27:07,230
How much money

701
00:27:07,350 --> 00:27:08,230
can a petty official make?

702
00:27:09,310 --> 00:27:11,190
We kidnap you,

703
00:27:11,190 --> 00:27:13,160
and your brother won't find out us.

704
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:13,880
Right?

705
00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:16,070
Alright, stop chatting.

706
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:17,430
Get to the business.

707
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:19,430
Are you Qiao Ruolan?

708
00:27:21,230 --> 00:27:23,310
Write down your secret recipe

709
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:24,590
for Jinrui Liquor.

710
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:31,350
He Shenwei sent you to kidnap me?

711
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:33,880
Who's that?

712
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
We don't know him.

713
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:37,430
Don't ask for trouble.

714
00:27:37,950 --> 00:27:38,280
Write.

715
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:42,400
If you don't do it,

716
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:43,950
you'll be raped and killed.

717
00:27:45,190 --> 00:27:45,830
I'll go first.

718
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:47,520
Come on!

719
00:27:50,190 --> 00:27:50,880
Stop!

720
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:52,230
Stop!

721
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:53,430
I'll write.

722
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:55,000
Stop, I'll write.

723
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:02,590
What a bummer!

724
00:28:09,190 --> 00:28:09,800
Write!

725
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:19,160
Come on, what's the matter with you?

726
00:28:21,710 --> 00:28:23,110
If you scare me,

727
00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:24,640
I'll forget everything out of fear.

728
00:28:26,710 --> 00:28:27,640
Forget?

729
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,310
How about this?

730
00:28:33,110 --> 00:28:33,950
Qiao Ruolan,

731
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,710
if you try to drag your feet,

732
00:28:36,710 --> 00:28:38,040
I'll cut off your hand.

733
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:39,070
Write!

734
00:28:42,590 --> 00:28:43,430
I remember now.

735
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:04,710
Young Master,

736
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:06,400
you couldn't invite Jin Nang.

737
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:07,070
That's fine.

738
00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:08,070
Why did you waste money

739
00:29:08,070 --> 00:29:09,230
to invite them?

740
00:29:09,230 --> 00:29:10,560
You know nothing.

741
00:29:10,830 --> 00:29:12,430
I've made a promise.

742
00:29:13,430 --> 00:29:15,040
Who would think

743
00:29:15,070 --> 00:29:16,560
that Jin Nang isn't
at Mingke House anymore.

744
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:18,880
It doesn't matter.

745
00:29:19,950 --> 00:29:21,310
I invited the Five Beauties instead.

746
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:22,920
So what?

747
00:29:23,230 --> 00:29:24,350
Chief Luo didn't show up.

748
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:24,830
That

749
00:29:24,830 --> 00:29:26,040
is what upsets me the most.

750
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:28,880
We made an appointment today,

751
00:29:29,190 --> 00:29:30,350
but she didn't show up.

752
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:36,590
Young Master,

753
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:38,400
shall we just wrap it up?

754
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,350
Can I ask them

755
00:29:39,350 --> 00:29:40,280
to charge less?

756
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:41,470
Wrap it up.

757
00:29:42,310 --> 00:29:43,310
I'm in no mood.

758
00:29:44,230 --> 00:29:45,040
But,

759
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:46,710
pay them generously.

760
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:47,590
Don't embarrass me.

761
00:30:19,310 --> 00:30:20,430
If you touch her,

762
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:21,680
I won't write anymore.

763
00:30:22,110 --> 00:30:23,590
It's not up to you.

764
00:30:23,590 --> 00:30:24,590
Just write it down.

765
00:30:32,070 --> 00:30:32,920
You don't write, huh?

766
00:30:34,110 --> 00:30:35,310
If you don't write,

767
00:30:35,310 --> 00:30:36,400
you'll end up like that.

768
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:39,430
Okay,

769
00:30:40,070 --> 00:30:40,680
I'll do it.

770
00:30:41,190 --> 00:30:41,680
Write!

771
00:30:55,070 --> 00:30:55,950
I'm done.

772
00:30:56,070 --> 00:30:56,880
Done?

773
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:57,880
Let me see.

774
00:31:14,590 --> 00:31:15,070
Stop.

775
00:31:19,830 --> 00:31:20,760
Someone jumped into the river.

776
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:29,950
Stop.

777
00:31:30,190 --> 00:31:31,070
Shoot her!

778
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:38,000
They are river bandits.

779
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:39,280
Go to save them.

780
00:31:39,470 --> 00:31:40,230
Go!

781
00:31:40,310 --> 00:31:41,070
I offer a big reward!

782
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:42,680
Don't let those river bandits escape!

783
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:43,350
Hurry up!

784
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:44,950
Go, go!

785
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:47,920
Shoot her!

786
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:51,590
You stop!

787
00:32:02,070 --> 00:32:03,280
She's running far away!

788
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:04,640
Shoot there!

789
00:32:05,470 --> 00:32:06,350
You stop!

790
00:32:07,190 --> 00:32:08,710
Don't let that person escape too!

791
00:32:08,710 --> 00:32:09,470
Come on!

792
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:19,830
Hey, you who is shooting!

793
00:32:21,590 --> 00:32:22,430
Who are you?

794
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:28,680
Someone over there is about to drown.

795
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:32,680
Luo Shu.

796
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:34,310
Luo Shu.

797
00:32:35,830 --> 00:32:36,470
Young Master.

798
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:37,040
Mr. Qi.

799
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:37,680
Mr. Qi.

800
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:39,470
Go... go to save Young Master.

801
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,710
Hurry up!

802
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:10,320
Luo Shu.

803
00:34:13,390 --> 00:34:13,870
Luo Shu.

804
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:18,630
How could you be kidnapped by them?

805
00:34:18,910 --> 00:34:20,120
Spit it out!

806
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:21,120
It's alright.

807
00:34:22,910 --> 00:34:24,280
Young Master.

808
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:29,360
Are you okay?

809
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:30,710
Luo Shu.

810
00:34:32,710 --> 00:34:34,470
Go... go to save Ruolan.

811
00:34:34,870 --> 00:34:35,390
Ruolan.

812
00:34:38,470 --> 00:34:39,470
Isn't she Jin Nang?

813
00:34:39,470 --> 00:34:39,800
Yes.

814
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:41,670
Young Master.

815
00:34:41,710 --> 00:34:43,000
Are you alright?

816
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:43,670
Young Master.

817
00:34:47,950 --> 00:34:48,360
Lian Shu,

818
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:49,710
go get the doctor.

819
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:50,430
Okay.

820
00:34:54,470 --> 00:34:55,870
Luo Shu, wait for me.

821
00:34:57,150 --> 00:34:57,910
Come with me.

822
00:34:58,040 --> 00:34:58,910
What's going on?

823
00:35:00,950 --> 00:35:01,760
Luo Shu.

824
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:02,910
Luo Shu.

825
00:35:02,910 --> 00:35:03,670
Miss Qiao.

826
00:35:03,670 --> 00:35:05,190
Keep searching along the river bank.

827
00:35:05,190 --> 00:35:06,040
Got it.

828
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:06,840
Luo Shu.

829
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:07,950
Miss Qiao.

830
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:10,670
Keep up.

831
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:11,600
That way.

832
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:12,520
Luo Shu.

833
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:13,520
Look.

834
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:14,470
Come on.

835
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:16,360
Your Honor.

836
00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:21,760
You're injured!

837
00:35:21,870 --> 00:35:22,600
I'm fine.

838
00:35:23,190 --> 00:35:24,000
Your Honor.

839
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:25,840
Ruolan is still in the water.

840
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,040
Please save her quickly!

841
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:27,840
Alright.

842
00:35:28,230 --> 00:35:28,910
Captain Cai.

843
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:29,630
Yes!

844
00:35:29,630 --> 00:35:31,280
Send more people
to search along the river.

845
00:35:31,430 --> 00:35:32,710
Make sure to find Qiao Ruolan.

846
00:35:32,710 --> 00:35:33,670
Got it! Let's go.

847
00:35:38,150 --> 00:35:38,840
Let's go back.

848
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:00,950
Trying to escape?

849
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:15,320
Young Master, let's go.

850
00:36:34,630 --> 00:36:36,190
Mr. Qi, don't you feel bad

851
00:36:36,190 --> 00:36:37,470
for missing Jin Nang?

852
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:40,280
Yes.

853
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:41,560
What's wrong?

854
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:42,950
The lady you just saved is Jin Nang,

855
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:44,390
or you can call her Luo Shuxiang.

856
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,800
It seems that

857
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,000
you two have a connection.

858
00:36:54,470 --> 00:36:55,520
Luo Shuxiang.

859
00:36:58,320 --> 00:36:59,600
She is Jin Nang.

860
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:07,230
You're so bold.

861
00:37:07,910 --> 00:37:09,430
It's a waste not being a coroner.

862
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:11,320
Thanks for the compliment.

863
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:12,390
I prefer dealing with

864
00:37:12,390 --> 00:37:13,600
living people.

865
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:17,190
Come on.

866
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:19,150
Alright.

867
00:37:19,710 --> 00:37:20,630
Don't let your wound get wet.

868
00:37:21,190 --> 00:37:22,320
You'll be fine in a few days.

869
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:23,600
Thank you.

870
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:31,360
Your Honor. What are you doing here?

871
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:34,910
Why don't you come in?

872
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:38,080
It's a lady's bedroom.

873
00:37:38,870 --> 00:37:39,670
I'm a man...

874
00:37:40,430 --> 00:37:41,870
I'm also a man.

875
00:37:42,710 --> 00:37:43,870
Don't worry, come in.

876
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:45,630
Please come in, Your Honor.

877
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:50,080
I don't worry about you.

878
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:05,670
How...how's your wound?

879
00:38:05,870 --> 00:38:06,600
She's fine.

880
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:08,390
The arrow didn't go deep,

881
00:38:08,390 --> 00:38:09,360
so it didn't hurt the bones.

882
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:10,320
I've taken care of it.

883
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:16,870
Are you done treating?

884
00:38:17,430 --> 00:38:18,280
I'm done.

885
00:38:24,870 --> 00:38:26,120
I've finished.

886
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:32,120
I'll just leave.

887
00:38:32,870 --> 00:38:33,520
Your Honor.

888
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:33,910
Okay.

889
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:47,560
Don't stand up.

890
00:38:51,950 --> 00:38:52,760
Forgot to close the door.

891
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:54,230
Please go on.

892
00:39:04,470 --> 00:39:05,080
What's this?

893
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:06,870
It's ginger decoction.

894
00:39:06,870 --> 00:39:07,950
Drink it while it's hot.

895
00:39:08,910 --> 00:39:09,870
It'll warm you up.

896
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:12,000
Thanks, Your Honor.

897
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:19,670
If it doesn't taste good,
please forgive me.

898
00:39:20,950 --> 00:39:22,150
Why?

899
00:39:24,950 --> 00:39:27,320
I cooked it myself.

900
00:39:28,670 --> 00:39:29,760
I'm afraid you may catch a cold.

901
00:39:29,870 --> 00:39:30,670
I intended to ask Baozi

902
00:39:30,670 --> 00:39:31,760
to make it and send it over.

903
00:39:32,190 --> 00:39:32,910
But when I went to the kitchen,

904
00:39:32,910 --> 00:39:34,360
I remembered that she had a day off.

905
00:39:34,390 --> 00:39:35,760
So,

906
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:37,320
I cooked it myself.

907
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:45,950
How does it taste?

908
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:56,870
I regret

909
00:39:56,870 --> 00:39:58,150
having you work at the county yamen.

910
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:00,560
It was so dangerous today.

911
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:02,840
If Mr. Qi didn't happen to be there,

912
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:04,280
I can't imagine the consequence.

913
00:40:05,230 --> 00:40:06,560
I like being a constable

914
00:40:06,870 --> 00:40:08,280
and working at the county yamen.

915
00:40:08,870 --> 00:40:10,080
I'm so grateful

916
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:11,670
that you allow me to work here.

917
00:40:11,670 --> 00:40:13,080
But I don't want you to take risks.

918
00:40:13,870 --> 00:40:14,600
I don't want you

919
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:16,000
to get hurt.

920
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:17,870
Promise me,

921
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:19,840
if you're in danger in the future,

922
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:21,560
don't rush in alone.

923
00:40:21,950 --> 00:40:24,000
I know you're brave and smart.

924
00:40:24,230 --> 00:40:25,080
But in my heart,

925
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:26,190
you should be protected by me,

926
00:40:26,190 --> 00:40:28,040
not charging ahead for me.

927
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:32,080
Luo Shu.

928
00:40:39,950 --> 00:40:40,760
Come in.

929
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:44,120
Your Honor.

930
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:45,280
Have you found Qiao Ruolan?

931
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:46,280
No.

932
00:40:46,390 --> 00:40:47,150
I've told Wu Er

933
00:40:47,150 --> 00:40:47,950
to send more people to look for her.

934
00:40:48,950 --> 00:40:49,560
Okay.

935
00:40:49,870 --> 00:40:51,320
It's ready for you to interrogate.

936
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:53,320
Let's go.

937
00:40:53,470 --> 00:40:54,040
Got it.

938
00:41:00,950 --> 00:41:01,870
Get some rest.

939
00:41:45,190 --> 00:41:46,710
Young Master.

940
00:41:46,710 --> 00:41:47,870
Why did you spend ten liang

941
00:41:47,870 --> 00:41:48,950
at the Deyilou Resturant

942
00:41:48,950 --> 00:41:50,600
just for this bowl of ginger decoction?

943
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:51,630
You don't understand.

944
00:41:51,630 --> 00:41:52,390
Give it to me.

945
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:53,710
You can go back.

946
00:41:53,710 --> 00:41:54,560
Don't follow me.

947
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:56,320
Miss Luo,

948
00:41:57,670 --> 00:41:58,470
I'm coming in.

949
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:03,600
What are you drinking?

950
00:42:04,710 --> 00:42:05,390
Ginger decoction.

951
00:42:06,390 --> 00:42:07,560
I also get you ginger decoction

952
00:42:09,710 --> 00:42:10,520
and chicken soup.

953
00:42:21,390 --> 00:42:22,190
Today,

954
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:24,390
