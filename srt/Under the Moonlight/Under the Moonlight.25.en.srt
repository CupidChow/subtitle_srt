[Under the Moonlight]

00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,700
[Adapted from the novel
"Jin Nang" by Shui He]

3
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:33,020
[Episode 25]

4
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:35,360
The steward of the Qin family
didn't want me.

5
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:37,120
He thought I was too young.

6
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:39,000
No matter how Qin Yi pleaded,

7
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:39,910
it was useless.

8
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,360
Just then, Wuniang passed by

9
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:44,230
and took a liking to me at first sight.

10
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:45,680
She made the decision

11
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:47,870
to bring me back to her place.

12
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:51,360
At that time, I was a maid,

13
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,120
but I didn't have to do any rough work.

14
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:55,480
Every day, I just followed her

15
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:57,800
to learn the rules, needlework,

16
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,760
and music and arts.

17
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,480
Wuniang was a kind-hearted person.

18
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:03,720
She treated you

19
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:04,800
like her own daughter.

20
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:06,680
At first, I felt that way too.

21
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,110
I was very grateful.

22
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,800
But later, I realized

23
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,320
she was raising me

24
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:15,800
like a tool,

25
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:16,960
something to be refined.

26
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:19,910
Something that one day

27
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:21,910
could bring her favor

28
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,000
and make her money.

29
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,600
You all want to see me

30
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:27,600
make a fool of myself, right?

31
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:30,390
Want to see me thrown out,

32
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:31,720
leaving in tears?

33
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:35,670
Not a chance!

34
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:37,030
I have no interest

35
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:39,080
in the Qin family.

36
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,630
When I get to Mingke House,

37
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:42,800
I will naturally live

38
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,630
a life of luxury.

39
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:47,030
I'll eat well and live lavishly,

40
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:49,320
far better

41
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:50,910
than in your shabby place.

42
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:54,550
Let's go.

43
00:02:55,670 --> 00:02:57,160
Wuniang, I don't want to go.

44
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,110
Please let me stay.

45
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:01,080
I raised you,

46
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,630
so you're mine.

47
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:03,630
Wherever I go,

48
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:04,800
you must follow.

49
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,670
Got it?

50
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:06,520
Let's go.

51
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:09,470
Wuniang,
I don't want to go to the music house.

52
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,000
You ungrateful wretch!

53
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:18,160
I raised you with so much difficulty,

54
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:20,520
and you dare to despise me?

55
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,030
Get up and go.

56
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:24,160
Let's go.

57
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,110
Madam,

58
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:32,320
please let me stay, Madam.

59
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:34,190
I was bought by the Qin family.

60
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:36,750
You can't let me go, Madam.

61
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,320
It's getting late.

62
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,630
Let's send Wuniang on her way.

63
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:44,910
Sanniang!

64
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,240
Siniang!

65
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:54,630
There's not a decent person
in the Qin family.

66
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,240
Get out of here!

67
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:18,110
Ruyi,

68
00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:19,640
help me.

69
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:21,550
I don't want to go, Ruyi.

70
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:23,670
Please help me talk to Mr. Qin.

71
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:58,070
Wuniang, you should leave quickly.

72
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:00,230
Take your dirty things with you

73
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,640
and get out of here!

74
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:17,830
You wretched boy,

75
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:20,670
I should have killed you back then.

76
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,510
I shouldn't have let you live.

77
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:27,880
Go!

78
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,880
During my years with the Qin family,

79
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,390
I always regarded Qin Yi

80
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:46,880
like my own brother.

81
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,230
I thought he was the only person

82
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:50,920
I could rely on in this world.

83
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:52,040
Ruyi,

84
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,480
look what this is.

85
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:55,950
What is this?

86
00:05:56,110 --> 00:05:57,640
A sweet melon, very sweet.

87
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,550
Here, try it.

88
00:05:58,670 --> 00:05:59,480
Sweet melon?

89
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:03,600
Is it sweet?

90
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:06,950
So sweet!

91
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,510
Where did you get it?

92
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:09,950
A merchant from beyond the pass

93
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:11,440
gave it to Wuniang.

94
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:12,600
Wuniang?

95
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:14,920
So sweet!

96
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:18,510
You shameless woman!

97
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:19,760
You shameless woman!

98
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:20,950
How dare you interfere

99
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:22,670
in my business from beyond the pass?

100
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,480
I didn't do anything.

101
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,950
I'm being wronged.

102
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:27,480
I've always been loyal to you!

103
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,070
Still defiant?

104
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:28,640
I...

105
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:29,880
You're so defiant!

106
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:30,390
So defiant!

107
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:30,950
How could I possibly...?

108
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:31,950
How dare you.

109
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:32,830
Please stop, Mr. Qin.

110
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:33,640
How dare you.

111
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:35,160
Mr. Qin, please stop!

112
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:36,600
Mr. Qin!

113
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:40,000
It wasn't until I went to Mingke House

114
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:42,000
that I gradually realized

115
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:43,920
he had been using

116
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,200
my trust in him

117
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,950
to ruthlessly bring down Wuniang.

118
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,040
It was from that day

119
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:52,670
that I finally understood

120
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,070
that I can only rely on myself.

121
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:00,830
People like him

122
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:02,000
are not worth befriending.

123
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,040
Just stay away from him.

124
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:23,110
Ruyi.

125
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:24,950
Yulan!

126
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:31,670
Long time no see.

127
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:34,110
Why don't you

128
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:36,320
call me brother?

129
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:39,320
I'm an orphan. I have no brothers.

130
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:40,920
You always called me

131
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,000
brother before.

132
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,110
Yulan,

133
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:44,510
from now on,

134
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:45,950
you don't have to be afraid anymore.

135
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:46,880
Now,

136
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:48,950
I am the master of the Qin family.

137
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:52,070
Congratulations, Mr. Qin.

138
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:54,790
I came specifically to take you home.

139
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:56,760
Come with me.

140
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,880
I know you've always resented me,

141
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,230
but you should understand

142
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:09,320
that I wanted to help you back then.

143
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,950
It was just that
I didn't have the ability.

144
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,830
At that time, I was insignificant,

145
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:16,920
and one misstep

146
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,350
could have angered my father,

147
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:19,790
bringing disaster upon myself.

148
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:21,440
So I told myself

149
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:25,200
that enduring for a moment
can lead to great achievements.

150
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,000
Yulan,

151
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:29,600
could you please

152
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,950
give me another chance?

153
00:08:32,710 --> 00:08:33,710
I want to make up for these two years...

154
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:34,550
Mr. Qin,

155
00:08:35,910 --> 00:08:37,230
you owe me nothing.

156
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,910
I don't need you
to make up for anything.

157
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:44,910
I'm no longer called Yulan.

158
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:46,000
Just as

159
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,470
you are no longer Ruyi.

160
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:54,440
It's all in the past.

161
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,440
You are no longer Yulan,

162
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,230
nor are you Jin Nang.

163
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:03,280
You are now Luo Shu,

164
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,200
the one I admire most.

165
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:06,840
Rest assured,

166
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:08,590
from now on,

167
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,280
everything will get better.

168
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:22,590
Mrs. Guo.

169
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:27,080
Luo, you're here!

170
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,400
I want to ask you

171
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,550
about what happened back then.

172
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:33,230
Darling, come out!

173
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:34,320
Look who's here!

174
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:41,280
Stop! Who are you?

175
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:43,640
What are you doing?

176
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:45,150
This is Mr. Menglin.

177
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:46,590
How dare you stop him?

178
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,670
Mr. Menglin, what brings you here?

179
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,400
I came to ask you something.

180
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:53,150
Please come in.

181
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,080
What do you want to ask?

182
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:05,000
You've been in the army for a long time.

183
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,280
I want to ask you

184
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:07,150
who was in charge of military supplies

185
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:08,840
thirteen years ago.

186
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:11,550
What kind of supplies?

187
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:12,880
Petroleum.

188
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:15,790
I can't remember that.

189
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:17,550
There must be a roster.

190
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:21,230
Even if there is a roster,

191
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,760
it wouldn't be for me to see.

192
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:24,760
Who has the roster?

193
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:25,840
Take me to see him.

194
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:27,000
Mr. Menglin,

195
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,910
please don't
make things difficult for me.

196
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:29,960
Breaking the rules

197
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,840
can lead to military punishment.

198
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:34,670
How about this?

199
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:36,880
You can go and ask at home first.

200
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,080
If the governor gives you a pass,

201
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:41,000
you can investigate whoever

202
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:42,710
or whatever you want.

203
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:50,960
Take care, Mr. Menglin.

204
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:56,150
Help yourself.

205
00:10:57,550 --> 00:10:58,400
Mr. Guo,

206
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,400
thirteen years ago,

207
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,670
a few days after my house was burned,

208
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:04,280
there were several people
at the alley entrance

209
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:05,710
asking about the fire at my house.

210
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:06,960
Do you remember?

211
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,200
How could I forget?

212
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,910
The day after your house caught fire,

213
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,910
two strangers

214
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:17,400
were wandering near the ruins.

215
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,000
When they saw me,

216
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:20,320
they asked me

217
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:22,150
about the fire.

218
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,440
They even asked if anyone survived.

219
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:26,840
I thought those two

220
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,760
looked suspicious,

221
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:30,760
so I didn't tell them the truth.

222
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,710
Do you remember what they looked like?

223
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:33,790
Any distinguishing features?

224
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:37,790
What did they look like?

225
00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:42,320
It was too long ago.

226
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,670
I can't remember clearly.

227
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:47,710
The food is getting cold.

228
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,790
Luo, have a bun.

229
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:51,470
Yes.

230
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,880
Mr. and Mrs. Guo, take your time eating.

231
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:56,200
I'll leave now.

232
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,080
You should eat before you go.

233
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:58,910
No, thanks.

234
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:00,200
I'll eat the bun

235
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,790
on the way.

236
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,640
Girl, eat before you leave.

237
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:04,440
Luo,

238
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:10,230
What is it, Mr. Guo?

239
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,200
I still...

240
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:12,840
I...

241
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,670
I remember something.

242
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:21,440
But if I say it,

243
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,200
I'm afraid
it'll tarnish your father's reputation.

244
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:25,440
What is it?

245
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:26,710
I remember

246
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,640
the day your house caught fire.

247
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:33,790
Hello.

248
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:35,710
Guo.

249
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:36,440
Qingfeng.

250
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,590
What's going on?

251
00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:41,030
You've bought so many nice things.

252
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:42,230
You know what, Guo,

253
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:43,760
I won today!

254
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:45,350
You won?

255
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:46,760
A fellow worker

256
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:47,520
invited me

257
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:49,320
to play a few rounds
at Changsheng Gambling House.

258
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:50,440
Unexpectedly,

259
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:52,110
it was my first time gambling,

260
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:53,230
and I ended up winning

261
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:54,110
against all those veterans.

262
00:12:55,470 --> 00:12:56,350
That's great!

263
00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:57,760
You should take me next time.

264
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,520
I want to try my luck too.

265
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:00,440
Sure.

266
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,280
I just bought chicken and fish today.

267
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,280
Come over for a drink.

268
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:06,200
I can't.
I still have deliveries to make.

269
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,440
Alright, let's do it another day.

270
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,590
Another day.

271
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:09,280
Take care.

272
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,350
Alright.

273
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,150
Changsheng Gambling House?

274
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:16,880
Is it still around?

275
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,000
Yes, over to the east.

276
00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:20,590
Just two streets away

277
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:22,080
from our Dongjiaxiang.

278
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:29,520
Don't worry, I didn't say anything.

279
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:40,320
This is a sin.

280
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:43,470
What a good girl Luo is,

281
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,910
and we're deceiving her.

282
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:49,110
Put away your compassionate heart.

283
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,350
Our son is in their hands.

284
00:13:51,710 --> 00:13:52,960
How can we refuse to do

285
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,080
as they say?

286
00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:57,080
They have money and power.

287
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:00,470
Can ordinary people like us
afford to offend them?

288
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:01,880
But

289
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:03,760
we watched Luo grow up.

290
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:06,760
She's just like our own daughter.

291
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:09,280
She lost her parents when she was young.

292
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:12,030
She considers us family.

293
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:19,960
If you want
to cut off the Guo family's roots,

294
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:22,910
just tell her the truth.

295
00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:35,960
Bite it.

296
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:38,670
Big or small?

297
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:39,640
Once you decide, stick to it.

298
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:40,320
Hurry up!

299
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:51,960
Sir, care to play a couple of rounds?

300
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,760
No, I'm looking for someone.

301
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:54,960
Someone?

302
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,280
Who are you looking for?

303
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:57,760
The owner of the gambling house.

304
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:59,150
Please bring him out.

305
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:00,550
Looking for my boss?

306
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:01,840
Do you think

307
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:03,440
you can just meet my boss
whenever you want?

308
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:09,550
I'm here to discuss business

309
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:10,640
with your boss.

310
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:11,880
Are you trying

311
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,320
to cut off his income?

312
00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:14,280
No.

313
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:15,790
I'm sorry.

314
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:16,640
Please wait a moment.

315
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:18,200
I'll go get my boss right away.

316
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:21,470
Come on.

317
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:22,550
Come on, big or small?

318
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:23,640
Once you decide, stick to it!

319
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:24,790
Big!

320
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:29,840
That's him.

321
00:15:32,710 --> 00:15:34,280
I am the owner here.

322
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:35,710
Sir,

323
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:37,150
you have something profitable

324
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,080
to discuss with me?

325
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:40,590
It's an old matter.

326
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:42,320
I want to ask you about it.

327
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:44,400
That's easy.

328
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,880
This place is
not only a den of gold and silver,

329
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:48,110
but also a sea of information.

330
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:50,550
Anything has its price here.

331
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:51,840
Honesty guaranteed.

332
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:52,960
Good.

333
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:55,230
Thirteen years ago,

334
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:56,150
a minor official

335
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:57,230
from the granary of Taiyuanwei

336
00:15:57,230 --> 00:15:58,520
once gambled here.

337
00:15:58,760 --> 00:15:59,960
Do you still remember him?

338
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,470
Are you talking about the one

339
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:08,230
whose house caught fire after winning?

340
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,670
You still remember after so long?

341
00:16:13,710 --> 00:16:16,670
After the incident,
the officers came to ask questions,

342
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:19,000
so I do have some impression.

343
00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:20,440
Who is the owner here?

344
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:24,320
I am. What's this about?

345
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,030
Take him away!

346
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:27,320
Wait, you can't take him!

347
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:30,280
Step aside. Don't block the way!

348
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:30,960
Go!

349
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:32,400
On what grounds are you arresting me?

350
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:33,230
Let go of me!

351
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:34,640
Let go of me!

352
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:37,550
Yanjin!

353
00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:40,320
Yanjin, I need to talk...

354
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:47,760
This...

355
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:50,910
Fengzhou, you're also here.

356
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:52,400
Not only am I here,

357
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:53,840
I also know

358
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:56,030
about your unauthorized entry
into the military camp today.

359
00:16:58,150 --> 00:17:00,000
Deputy Commandant of Pingyangwei,

360
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:02,320
the son of the governor.

361
00:17:02,910 --> 00:17:04,640
What great official power you have!

362
00:17:06,350 --> 00:17:07,830
Fengzhou, calm down.

363
00:17:07,830 --> 00:17:08,760
Have some water.

364
00:17:17,350 --> 00:17:18,920
And don't rush to scold him.

365
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:20,760
Perhaps

366
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:23,000
he has some reason for it.

367
00:17:24,830 --> 00:17:25,280
Alright.

368
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:27,430
Then tell me,

369
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,280
what great reason do you have

370
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:32,230
for breaking into the garrison?

371
00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:34,430
I was trying to help a friend

372
00:17:35,310 --> 00:17:36,350
investigate an old case.

373
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:37,190
Nonsense!

374
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:41,000
What case requires
breaking into a military camp?

375
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,160
And questioning military supplies?

376
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,800
Fengzhou, I'm not being reckless.

377
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:46,310
Over a decade ago,

378
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:47,800
someone set fire to my friend's house,

379
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,560
killing her parents.

380
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:50,520
They used petroleum.

381
00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:51,830
But isn't petroleum

382
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:53,430
only available in the military camp?

383
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:54,950
Where else would I go for it?

384
00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:56,070
What fire?

385
00:17:56,190 --> 00:17:57,110
What petroleum?

386
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:59,160
Who told you about all this?

387
00:17:59,710 --> 00:18:00,830
The fire is a fact.

388
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:02,400
The petroleum is what we discovered.

389
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,110
You?

390
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:05,590
You and your friend?

391
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:06,350
Yes.

392
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:07,710
She said petroleum, and you believed it?

393
00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:08,640
I believe it!

394
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:09,350
Menglin,

395
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:10,920
the military has always

396
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:11,830
strictly controlled petroleum.

397
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:13,430
It can't just flow into civilian hands.

398
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:15,040
You're just too naive,

399
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:16,000
too easily deceived.

400
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,350
She wouldn't deceive me!

401
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:18,520
So this matter must be wrong.

402
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:19,160
It can't be wrong!

403
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:19,760
Her clues

404
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:20,520
are all accurate!

405
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:21,560
Enough.

406
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:22,950
Stop wasting time with him.

407
00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:28,310
I understand now.

408
00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:31,710
I wanted to ask for your help.

409
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:33,160
I'll handle it myself.

410
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,800
No, Menglin, you...

411
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:47,310
Luo Shu,

412
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:48,880
I was just looking for you.

413
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,160
I have urgent matters
to discuss with you.

414
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:51,190
Urgent matters?

415
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,040
I found out
about the Changsheng Gambling House.

416
00:18:53,070 --> 00:18:54,470
I was about to ask the owner

417
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:55,640
when a group of constables barged in

418
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:56,800
and forcibly took him away.

419
00:18:56,830 --> 00:18:58,000
Do you have a way for me to see him?

420
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:58,760
Constables?

421
00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:00,800
They must be from Taiyuan Yamen.

422
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:01,640
Come with me.

423
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:07,940
[Taiyuan Yamen]

424
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,880
Qi Menglin, what do you want from me?

425
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,800
Who is this?

426
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,230
This is Mr. Luo, my friend.

427
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:23,520
This is the son
of Taiyuan Prefectural Magistrate,

428
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,310
Sun Qian.

429
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:26,110
The Shanxi Provincial Administration
Commission Interrogator,

430
00:19:26,110 --> 00:19:26,830
my friend.

431
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:28,310
Nice to meet you.

432
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:29,640
Nice to meet you too.

433
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:31,590
I won't beat around the bush.

434
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:32,920
I need your help.

435
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:33,950
Go ahead.

436
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:35,470
Who went
to the Changsheng Gambling House

437
00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:36,760
and captured the owner?

438
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,160
Step forward.

439
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,230
If you confess honestly,
there will be no trouble.

440
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:47,110
Otherwise, if I find out,

441
00:19:48,110 --> 00:19:49,800
you'll lose your job.

442
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,190
Everyone else can leave now.

443
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:14,110
Qi Menglin, and Mr. Luo,

444
00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:15,280
if you have any questions,

445
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,280
feel free to ask.

446
00:20:20,310 --> 00:20:22,070
Where is the owner
of the gambling house now?

447
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:25,000
It's Mr. Zhao.

448
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:25,950
He ordered us
to go to the gambling house

449
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:26,920
and capture the owner,

450
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:28,160
then take him to the Guandi Temple

451
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,560
and hand him over to some strangers.

452
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:30,040
After that,

453
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:31,160
we never saw him again.

454
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:33,040
So you were just following orders

455
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:34,310
and know nothing of the details?

456
00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:35,000
Yes.

457
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:36,800
Mr. Zhao even gave me
five liang of silver

458
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:38,950
to treat my men to drink.

459
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:39,880
Find that prefectural judge

460
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:40,800
and get him over.

461
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:42,470
I'll wait right here.

462
00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:43,400

Good evening, Mr. Sun.

465
00:20:58,280 --> 00:20:59,310
You're not needed here.

466
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:00,640
Go back to your posts.

467
00:21:00,710 --> 00:21:01,520
Yes.

468
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:06,470
So you were the one who ordered them

469
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:07,950
to capture the gambling house owner?

470
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:09,520
Yes.

471
00:21:09,950 --> 00:21:10,920
Who asked you to do that?

472
00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:13,400

473
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:15,110

Speak quickly.

It's...

477
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,560
It's an unfamiliar drinking buddy.

Who do you think you're fooling?

479
00:21:23,230 --> 00:21:25,560
A drinking buddy,
yet not familiar at all?

480
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:27,350
He asked you to do it, and you just did?

481
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:30,190
He...

482
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:32,950
He gave me 50 liang of silver.

483
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,070
Has your boss returned?

484
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,000
He was taken away

485
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:47,710
right under your nose.

486
00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:49,040
You saw it.

487
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:51,400
You jerk!

488
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:53,070
How dare you speak to me like that!

489
00:21:53,830 --> 00:21:55,950
Well, my boss hasn't returned yet.

The kidnappers just sent a dart message,

497
00:22:39,230 --> 00:22:40,310
saying our boss is in their hands.

498
00:22:40,310 --> 00:22:41,800
They want us to ransom him.

499
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:42,560
Anything else?

00:22:42,830 --> 00:22:44,560
The guy went to pay the ransom.

501
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:47,430

502

You're welcome.

No one's answering the door.

504
00:23:01,350 --> 00:23:02,400
Did they run away again?

00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:03,710
Go!

506
00:23:07,310 --> 00:23:08,110

00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:37,710
from the granary of Taiyuanwei

532
00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:38,880

all the details you know.

He came during the day to gamble.

536
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,190
He gambled all day long.

537
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:49,560
He was on an incredible winning streak.

538
00:24:49,830 --> 00:24:50,710
When he left,

539
00:24:50,950 --> 00:24:51,950
he had pockets

540
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:53,560
full of money.

541
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,560
The next day, I heard

542
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:59,830
his house caught fire at night.

543
00:24:59,830 --> 00:25:01,920
His whole family perished in the flames.

544
00:25:02,310 --> 00:25:04,710
This news spread like wildfire.

545
00:25:04,950 --> 00:25:07,590
The officers came to ask questions.

546
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:11,040
Only then did I learn
he was named Luo Qingfeng.

547
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:13,520
He worked in the Taiyuanwei.

548
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:15,800
At that moment, I thought,

549
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:17,000
was it because

550
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,880
he won too much money

551
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:20,070
that someone

552
00:25:20,070 --> 00:25:21,230
got jealous?

553
00:25:21,710 --> 00:25:23,470
Did he often come here to gamble?

554
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:26,710
No, not really.

555
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:29,350
That day was his first time here.

556
00:25:31,350 --> 00:25:32,880
And it was also his last time.

557
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:37,070
Who brought him here?

558
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:39,430
The person who brought him

559
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:40,760
was a regular customer.

560
00:25:42,070 --> 00:25:43,710
It's strange to say,

561
00:25:44,190 --> 00:25:46,070
ever since Luo Qingfeng died,

562
00:25:46,190 --> 00:25:47,000
that person

563
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:48,640
never showed up again.

564
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:50,430
What was his name?

565
00:25:52,110 --> 00:25:53,800
I don't know his name.

566
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,190
But I do remember

567
00:25:56,470 --> 00:25:57,760
his appearance.

568
00:25:58,640 --> 00:25:59,800
He was quite tall,

569
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:01,430
with a square face,

570
00:26:01,950 --> 00:26:03,000
and somewhat dark skin.

571
00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:04,160
Where does he live?

572
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,640
How can we find him?

573
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:07,430
I don't even know his name.

574
00:26:07,470 --> 00:26:08,190
How would I know

575
00:26:08,190 --> 00:26:09,190
where he lives?

576
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:10,950
I've already told you

577
00:26:10,950 --> 00:26:12,280
everything I know.

578
00:26:13,350 --> 00:26:14,590
Do you know who kidnapped you?

579
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:16,880
I've made many enemies

580
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,560
running a gambling house.

581
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,470
How would I know who it is this time?

582
00:26:20,710 --> 00:26:22,110
I find it puzzling.

583
00:26:22,430 --> 00:26:24,590
I was clearly taken by the officers.

584
00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:25,230
Why did I end up

585
00:26:25,230 --> 00:26:26,680
in the hands of kidnappers?

586
00:26:28,350 --> 00:26:29,040
Sir,

587
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:30,350
you have to explain it.

588
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:32,430
Sir!

589
00:26:48,590 --> 00:26:49,400
Come in!

590
00:26:53,830 --> 00:26:55,160
Are you Miss Luo?

591
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:56,590
Yes.

592
00:26:56,950 --> 00:26:57,760
What is it?

593
00:26:58,310 --> 00:26:59,590
Mr. Menglin told me

594
00:26:59,590 --> 00:27:01,430
to give you these butter pastries.

595
00:27:04,070 --> 00:27:04,880
Enjoy.

596
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:05,830
Thank you.

597
00:27:20,190 --> 00:27:21,680
Where have you been for so long?

598
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:22,640
Don't ask.

599
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:26,800
Some pastries, huh?

600
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:28,560
Stop.

601
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:33,470
Rinse your mouth.

602
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:42,680
What's wrong?

603
00:27:55,830 --> 00:27:57,640
Even my place has been targeted?

604
00:27:59,280 --> 00:27:59,680
Lian...

605
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:00,350
Let's not raise any alarms.

606
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:01,350
The one delivering the pastries

607
00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:02,520
is just a stranger.

608
00:28:03,070 --> 00:28:04,160
He came in your name,

609
00:28:04,470 --> 00:28:06,070
saying they're for Miss Luo.

610
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,000
There's a mole.

611
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:19,070
Perhaps

612
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:21,470
it's because
I've made progress in my investigation.

613
00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:23,000
Someone is scared now.

614
00:28:23,190 --> 00:28:23,880
Now in the Qi family,

615
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:25,190
someone tried to poison you.

616
00:28:26,310 --> 00:28:27,350
So the events from back then

617
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:29,400
involved the Qi family as well?

618
00:28:29,590 --> 00:28:32,000
You should stay out of this matter.

619
00:28:32,190 --> 00:28:33,350
Luo Shu, let me explain.

620
00:28:33,350 --> 00:28:34,680
You were just a child back then.

621
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:36,830
No matter what the truth is,

622
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:37,920
it has nothing to do with you.

623
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,040
I don't want you to interfere.

624
00:28:40,710 --> 00:28:41,800
It'll put you in a difficult position.

625
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:42,470
No way.

626
00:28:43,070 --> 00:28:44,430
I will definitely help you
find the truth.

627
00:28:44,830 --> 00:28:45,800
Your life is in danger.

628
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:47,110
How can I just stand by?

629
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:48,680
Don't worry.

630
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:51,280
Even if it turns out
to be the Qi family's doing,

631
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:53,470
I will make sure you get an explanation.

632
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,070
This butter pastry

633
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:02,640
was

634
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,040
my favorite snack.

635
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:05,880
A few days ago,

636
00:29:06,110 --> 00:29:07,800
Qin Yi stopped me on the road

637
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:09,520
and took me to a tea house.

638
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,520
He even had this specially served.

639
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:18,470
So only Qin Yi would know

640
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:19,590
you like this.

641
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,430
Could he be the one who poisoned it?

642
00:29:22,350 --> 00:29:23,520
Qin Yi is suspicious,

643
00:29:24,070 --> 00:29:25,400
but he's very clever.

644
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,430
If he really wanted to harm me,

645
00:29:27,830 --> 00:29:28,560
he wouldn't leave

646
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:29,800
such obvious traces.

647
00:29:31,230 --> 00:29:32,520
If it wasn't Qin Yi,

648
00:29:34,070 --> 00:29:35,430
could someone else be following you?

649
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:39,190
The person who's been following me,

650
00:29:39,190 --> 00:29:40,160
watching me,

651
00:29:40,470 --> 00:29:41,880
and trying to poison me

652
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:43,430
could very well be

653
00:29:43,430 --> 00:29:44,950
someone involved in the fire back then.

654
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:46,560
At this point,

655
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:48,280
we can only lure
the snake out of its hole

656
00:29:48,350 --> 00:29:49,280
to find this person.

657
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:50,800
Lian Shu.

658
00:29:52,950 --> 00:29:53,680
Lian Shu.

659
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:54,310
Young Master.

660
00:29:54,470 --> 00:29:56,680
Tomorrow,
Luo Shu will go to Fahua Temple

661
00:29:56,710 --> 00:29:58,230
to pray for her parents' souls.

662
00:29:59,190 --> 00:30:00,590
Get the carriage ready.

663
00:30:02,190 --> 00:30:03,430
Young Master, are you going too?

664
00:30:03,830 --> 00:30:04,800
No, she's going alone.

665
00:30:05,110 --> 00:30:06,590
Have two reliable servants

666
00:30:06,590 --> 00:30:07,470
go with her.

667
00:30:08,070 --> 00:30:08,880
Yes, Young Master.

668
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:47,390
[Qi Mansion]

669
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:51,680
Mr. Qin.

670
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:02,070
Thank you, Mr. Qin.

671
00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:03,400
I'll announce your arrival.

672
00:31:22,190 --> 00:31:23,310
Please spare me!

673
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,680
Tell me, who sent you?

674
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:27,280
No one, really!

675
00:31:27,430 --> 00:31:28,310
Still being stubborn?

676
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:30,040
Do you want to die?

677
00:31:30,190 --> 00:31:31,190
No, I don't.

678
00:31:31,430 --> 00:31:33,070
What do you want me to say?

679
00:31:33,070 --> 00:31:34,310
Who is the mastermind?

680
00:31:34,710 --> 00:31:36,070
What mastermind?

681
00:31:36,110 --> 00:31:36,920
Beat him!

682
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:41,710
Don't hit me!

683
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:43,040
Spare me!

684
00:31:43,950 --> 00:31:44,560
Stop!

685
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:45,070
Spare me!

686
00:31:45,950 --> 00:31:46,640
Spare me!

687
00:31:50,110 --> 00:31:51,310
Why were you following me?

688
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:52,710
Because

689
00:31:52,950 --> 00:31:55,520
you're beautiful,

690
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:57,760
and I wanted to touch you.

691
00:31:58,040 --> 00:31:58,950
You're so bold!

692
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:00,000
Beat him up!

693
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:02,040
I won't do it again!

694
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:04,520
I really won't!

695
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:07,560
Over there!

696
00:32:08,070 --> 00:32:08,680
- Chase!
- Yes.

697
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:13,710
This jade cost me a fortune.

698
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:14,710
I got it from the minister

699
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:16,520
who loves it as well.

700
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:18,190
It's rare.

701
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:22,710
So precious.

702
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:25,350
"He is as beautiful as jade."

703
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:26,350
In my opinion,

704
00:32:26,350 --> 00:32:27,230
only you deserve

705
00:32:27,470 --> 00:32:30,160
this jade.

706
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,350
If it's about the salt permit,

707
00:32:40,710 --> 00:32:41,560
Qin,

708
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:44,040
it's better not to mention it.

709
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:52,760
But everything has its flexibility.

710
00:32:53,110 --> 00:32:54,950
How about I propose a plan?

711
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:58,590
Stop! Don't run!

712
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:01,430
Catch him! A reward of 100 liang!

713
00:33:01,430 --> 00:33:03,310
Stop! Don't run!

714
00:33:04,830 --> 00:33:05,560
Stop!

715
00:33:10,830 --> 00:33:12,590
Why aren't you running anymore?

716
00:33:16,470 --> 00:33:17,280
Lian Qi!

[One Hundred Thousand Liang]

718
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:29,350
You're really looking down

719
00:33:29,350 --> 00:33:30,470
on the Qi family.

720
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:31,310
No.

721
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:32,950
This is for you.

722
00:33:32,950 --> 00:33:33,920
Your personal share.

723
00:33:34,350 --> 00:33:35,280
A hundred thousand this year.

724
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:36,920
And a hundred thousand every year after.

725
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:38,070
I told you,

726
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:40,430
it's my father's decision.

727
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:42,230
This matter is significant.

728
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:43,800
It's not something a son like me

729
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:44,830
can decide.

730
00:33:45,350 --> 00:33:47,000
Everyone is in it for profit.

731
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:48,710
I won't have you

732
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,070
go to the Governor

733
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:51,920
and talk without any substance.

734
00:33:53,350 --> 00:33:54,430
In previous years,
the Qi and Qin families

735
00:33:54,430 --> 00:33:55,520
shared profits equally.

736
00:33:56,350 --> 00:33:57,830
How about a 60-40 split now?

737
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:04,710
What about a 70-30 split?

738
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:07,190
Is 70-30 acceptable?

739
00:34:07,230 --> 00:34:08,840
You have to let me earn a little.

Why don't you understand?

There's great turmoil in the court.

743
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:20,760
My father's withdrawal now

744
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:22,520
concerns the future of the Qi family

745
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:23,360
and its fate.

746
00:34:23,710 --> 00:34:25,190
It's not merely about profit.

00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:38,080
what am I?

You can try it.

You're used to the Qi family's tea.

00:35:05,260 --> 00:35:07,180
[One Hundred Thousand Liang]

763
00:35:13,430 --> 00:35:14,230
By the way,

764
00:35:15,470 --> 00:35:17,390
don't have any designs on Menglin.

765
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:21,390
Yanjin!

766
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:23,950
Yanjin!

767
00:35:25,150 --> 00:35:25,870
Menglin!

768
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:27,320
This...

769
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:34,470
Qin, is there anything else?

770
00:35:35,390 --> 00:35:36,560
I'll take my leave then.

771
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:47,230
Menglin, what's the matter?

772
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:48,040
Yanjin.

773
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:49,710
Did you send Lian Qi

774
00:35:49,710 --> 00:35:50,710
to follow Luo Shu?

775
00:35:55,190 --> 00:35:56,000
So,

776
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:57,360
the pastries delivered yesterday

777
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:58,600
were sent by you?

778
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,280
What pastries?

779
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:02,430
The poisoned butter pastries.

780
00:36:02,950 --> 00:36:04,150
They were sent to my place,

781
00:36:04,190 --> 00:36:06,080
specifically for Miss Luo.

782
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:07,280
I had Lian Qi

783
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:08,840
monitor your movements.

784
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:10,710
But how could you think

785
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:13,560
I would do something
so despicable as poisoning?

786
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:14,230
Isn't it because

787
00:36:14,230 --> 00:36:15,320
Luo Shu has made progress

788
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:16,150
in investigating the fire incident?

789
00:36:16,430 --> 00:36:17,080
Isn't it because

790
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:17,760
the death of Luo Shu's parents

791
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:18,320
is related to the Qi family

792
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:19,430
that you want to silence her?

793
00:36:19,430 --> 00:36:20,080
Nonsense!

794
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:24,360
How would I know about her family?

795
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,600
Why would I silence her?

796
00:36:30,470 --> 00:36:32,040
You and I are brothers.

797
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:34,230
How could you suspect me like this?

798
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:50,600
Mr. Luo,

799
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:52,910
where are you going?

800
00:36:53,630 --> 00:36:55,320
Staying here is quite bothersome,

801
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:55,670
so I thought

802
00:36:55,670 --> 00:36:57,360
it would be better to stay at an inn.

803
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:58,360
So...

804
00:36:58,430 --> 00:36:59,870
Did my young master know?

805
00:37:00,630 --> 00:37:01,910
I think he did.

806
00:37:02,950 --> 00:37:03,800
That's good.

807
00:37:03,950 --> 00:37:05,600
Otherwise, he would blame us.

808
00:37:06,670 --> 00:37:08,630
Mr. Luo, you can pack up.

809
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,430
There are fresh fruits in the kitchen.

810
00:37:10,430 --> 00:37:11,430
They're quite rare.

811
00:37:11,470 --> 00:37:12,910
I'll go get some for you.

812
00:37:21,430 --> 00:37:22,280
What I fear the most

813
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:23,120
is that the death of Luo Shu's parents

814
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:24,080
is related to the Qi family.

815
00:37:25,390 --> 00:37:26,840
But now the clues
point to the Qi family.

816
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:27,950
I must warn you, Yanjin.

817
00:37:28,230 --> 00:37:30,000
If you want to kill her,
you must kill me first.

818
00:37:30,430 --> 00:37:31,600
If Luo Shu dies,

819
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:33,630
I will not live alone.

820
00:37:35,870 --> 00:37:37,120
Let me tell you again.

821
00:37:38,670 --> 00:37:40,280
I don't know her parents.

822
00:37:40,710 --> 00:37:42,870
Their deaths
have nothing to do with the Qi family.

823
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:45,520
As for the poisoned pastries,

824
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:46,910
I have no knowledge of that either.

825
00:37:46,910 --> 00:37:47,320
Then why

826
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:48,360
ever since Luo Shu arrived in Taiyuan

827
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:49,360
and stayed at my place,

828
00:37:49,950 --> 00:37:51,360
have you had Lian Qi follow her?

829
00:37:51,870 --> 00:37:53,120
Because I can't help but worry

830
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:54,000
about my own brother.

831
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,040
He's infatuated

832
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:56,190
with a lowly woman,

833
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:57,710
almost ruining his future

834
00:37:57,710 --> 00:37:58,910
and even his life.

835
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:03,470
You spend all day

836
00:38:03,470 --> 00:38:04,430
being attentive to her,

837
00:38:04,430 --> 00:38:05,760
surrounding her completely.

838
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:07,120
I warned her

839
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:08,190
to stay away from you.

840
00:38:08,430 --> 00:38:10,230
I even urged you
not to pursue her anymore.

841
00:38:10,230 --> 00:38:11,230
Did you listen?

842
00:38:13,150 --> 00:38:16,000
She, on the other hand,
still clings to you,

843
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:18,360
and you are utterly enchanted by her.

844
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,360
How can I not be worried?

845
00:38:22,430 --> 00:38:23,120
Yanjin!

846
00:38:24,670 --> 00:38:26,000
What are you talking about?

847
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:38,280
Mr. Qin.

848
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:47,150
Take care.

849
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:53,630
Young Master!

850
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
Mr. Luo is packing his things

851
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,000
and is leaving now.

852
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:56,760
How dare you!

853
00:38:57,390 --> 00:38:58,870
You impudent girl!

854
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,470
Is this place
for you to come and go freely?

855
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:02,840
I'm sorry.

856
00:39:03,630 --> 00:39:04,430
I just...

857
00:39:04,470 --> 00:39:05,600
I saw Mr. Qin Yi

858
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:06,760
at the door just now,

859
00:39:06,950 --> 00:39:08,950
so I forgot to announce.

860
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:10,870
I think he has left by now.

861
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:12,360
Young Master,

862
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:14,560
I'll go stop Mr. Luo right now.

863
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:23,910
Just a friend.

864
00:39:24,670 --> 00:39:26,080
If she leaves, let her go.

865
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:29,840
Yanjin,

866
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:32,280
is background really that important?

867
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:33,950
Why do you judge Luo Shu's worth

868
00:39:33,950 --> 00:39:35,230
only by her background?

869
00:39:36,710 --> 00:39:37,800
What I like is her.

870
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:39,950
Her status and family

871
00:39:39,950 --> 00:39:41,150
have nothing to do with it.

872
00:39:41,230 --> 00:39:42,560
She says you're just friends.

873
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:44,470
That's called liking?

874
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:48,280
It's my unrequited love.

875
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:49,560
I'm the one in love with her,

876
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:50,470
and she knows nothing.

877
00:39:51,390 --> 00:39:52,320
It's me

878
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,040
who brought her to Taiyuan.

879
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:55,120
It's me

880
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:55,910
who tricked her
into staying at our place.

881
00:39:55,910 --> 00:39:57,230
I am the one with an ulterior motive,
not her.

882
00:39:57,230 --> 00:39:58,190
But she is destined

883
00:39:58,190 --> 00:39:58,800
not to be with us.

884
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,040
She has no prominent family background.

885
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:02,760
She has faced countless hardships

886
00:40:03,230 --> 00:40:04,910
but remains untainted.

887
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:07,120
She lives strong and free.

888
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:09,600
Such a person

889
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:11,710
is even more worthy of cherishing,

890
00:40:11,710 --> 00:40:12,800
more worthy of love.

891
00:40:14,390 --> 00:40:15,190
Yanjin,

892
00:40:16,470 --> 00:40:17,560
in my eyes,

893
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:19,470
she is the best woman

894
00:40:19,470 --> 00:40:20,600
in the world.

895
00:40:21,910 --> 00:40:23,080
One of a kind.

896
00:40:25,230 --> 00:40:26,120
Where are you going?

897
00:40:26,430 --> 00:40:27,600
Aren't you trying to drive her away?

898
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:29,470
Then I will leave with her.

899
00:40:30,230 --> 00:40:31,390
No matter where it is,

900
00:40:31,390 --> 00:40:32,320
I will go with her.

901
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:33,760
Menglin!

902
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:34,150
Let me go!

903
00:40:34,150 --> 00:40:35,360
Menglin, calm down!

904
00:40:35,870 --> 00:40:36,760
Don't act impulsively.

905
00:40:37,470 --> 00:40:38,360
I was wrong.

906
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:40,600
I'll apologize to you, okay?

907
00:40:41,710 --> 00:40:42,840
Give me a chance.

908
00:40:43,710 --> 00:40:44,430
Aren't you investigating

909
00:40:44,430 --> 00:40:45,870
the cause of her parents' deaths?

910
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:47,670
Alright.

911
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:49,670
I will help you.

912
00:40:58,040 --> 00:40:58,870
Come with me.

913
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:01,080
I told you long ago

914
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:02,710
that the Qi family
is certainly not good people.

915
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:03,470
You shouldn't trust

916
00:41:03,470 --> 00:41:04,430
Qi Menglin.

917
00:41:04,630 --> 00:41:05,520
It has nothing to do with him.

918
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,560
Even if he is unaware,

919
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:10,840
he still cannot

920
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:11,710
protect you.

921
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:13,040
You are investigating

922
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:13,950
the clues from the fire

923
00:41:13,950 --> 00:41:14,950
and your parents' deaths.

924
00:41:15,230 --> 00:41:16,560
You may have already
offended the Qi family,

925
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:17,760
making them very angry.

926
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:19,040
Come with me.

927
00:41:19,470 --> 00:41:20,800
I'll help you uncover the truth.

928
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:22,840
I'm much more reliable than Qi Menglin.

929
00:41:23,230 --> 00:41:24,230
Don't you think so?

930
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:27,430
I don't want

931
00:41:27,430 --> 00:41:28,760
to rely on anyone.

932
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:45,040
Young Master!

933
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:46,080
Young Master!

934
00:41:47,230 --> 00:41:48,230
Chief Luo has already settled

935
00:41:48,230 --> 00:41:49,000
in the inn.

936
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:49,840
According to your instructions,

937
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:51,280
the innkeeper and staff
have been informed,

938
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:53,000
and extra personnel have been sent
to protect her secretly.

939
00:41:54,150 --> 00:41:54,950
That's not enough.

940
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:57,230
At my place,

941
00:41:57,230 --> 00:41:58,470
someone tried to poison her.

942
00:41:59,000 --> 00:41:59,910
Now she is alone in the inn.

943
00:41:59,910 --> 00:42:00,950
Isn't that even more dangerous?

944
00:42:02,870 --> 00:42:03,670
Lian Shu,

945
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,360
go to the room next to Luo Shu's

946
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:06,630
and book it for me.

947
00:42:07,710 --> 00:42:08,520
Quickly!

948
00:42:09,230 --> 00:42:10,190
Yes, Young Master.

949
00:42:19,190 --> 00:42:23,040
"White Plum Blossom grows in icy winter,
blooming proudly,

950
00:42:24,430 --> 00:42:28,520
Not mixing
