00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:03,470
But I don't have enough money.

193
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:04,520
I can't afford it.

194
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,670
I'll just take my leave.

195
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:11,470
I'm not

196
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:13,320
a heartless person.

197
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:14,760
Since you're leaving,

198
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,470
I think you can

199
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:17,350
meet her

200
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,590
and say goodbye.

201
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Thank you.

202
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:29,910
Just an hour,

203
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:30,910
not even a minute more.

204
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:31,640
Go.

205
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:31,590
You've already broken off,

206
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:32,550
but you still refuse to give up on her.

207
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:35,350
That's ungallant.

208
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:38,320
You're the one who won't give up on her.

209
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,200
Even so,

210
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:42,880
there's a big difference between us.

211
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,030
You can't let go or hold on.

212
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:46,080
You want to have it all.

213
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:46,760
As for me,

214
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:49,080
I want to marry her openly.

215
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:49,670
Marry her?

216
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:50,280
Yes.

217
00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:53,350
Why do you think you can?

218
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:54,960
Because I can give her
everything she wants.

219
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,470
In my lifetime,

220
00:12:57,670 --> 00:12:58,760
I'll only marry her.

221
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:01,030
Being cautious and hesitant

222
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:02,280
is not me.

223
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,760
Even if I'm useless,

224
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:06,640
I won't give up my loved one

225
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:07,880
for fame or fortune.

226
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:10,960
I'm just following my heart.

227
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:12,840
I like her,

228
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:14,670
so I'll marry her to be my wife,

229
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:16,440
giving her proper status and protection.

230
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,000
I'm not as reckless as you,

231
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:20,590
because you're born in the Qi family.

232
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,150
You spend lavishly,

233
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:23,470
but every coin you spend

234
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:24,760
is the hard-earned money
of the common people.

235
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:26,280
You don't need to know

236
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,590
what hardships are like,

237
00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:29,440
so you don't need to be cautious.

238
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,760
You just said shamelessly

239
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:32,880
that you are not

240
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:33,910
a hesitant person.

241
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:35,520
But without

242
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:37,550
your family supporting you,

243
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:39,150
you're nobody.

244
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,840
Where would your confidence come from?

245
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:46,200
Just because I was born in the Qi family,

246
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:50,000
it'll be even harder
for me to marry her.

247
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:51,840
But I'm not afraid.

248
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:53,640
For her,

249
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:55,000
I'd overcome all kinds of difficulties.

250
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,030
I would do anything.

251
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,550
If you really care about her,

252
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:01,910
stay away from her.

253
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:03,760
If she ends up with you,

254
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:05,230
she'll eventually be dragged down.

255
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:23,000
I didn't expect you to come see me.

256
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:24,400
I thought

257
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:25,910
you'd never talk to me.

258
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:27,280
How could I?

259
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:29,150
You're my best friend.

260
00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:31,200
I've missed you.

261
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:33,230
It was all my fault.

262
00:14:33,710 --> 00:14:35,400
I almost held you back at that time.

263
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,150
Miaocui,

264
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:43,470
how have you been?

265
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:45,670
Nothing special.

266
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,550
It's the same as before,

267
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,470
no change at all.

268
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,080
Miaocui.

269
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,030
I got my removal papers.

270
00:14:58,710 --> 00:14:59,440
Really?

271
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:03,790
That's great.

272
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,840
Look at you now.

273
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:08,440
You got removal papers,

274
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:10,470
and became the chief at the yamen.

275
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,000
In the future,

276
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:14,230
no one will dare to mess with you.

277
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,000
Let's leave together.

278
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,280
I'll redeem you.

279
00:15:17,670 --> 00:15:19,440
It doesn't matter if you don't
get removal papers.

280
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:20,590
I'll support you.

281
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:27,670
Luo Shu,

282
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:31,080
do you really not despise me?

283
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:32,470
Of course not.

284
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,440
I knew it.

285
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:41,710
I know you are the best.

286
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:43,470
Then it's settled.

287
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:46,030
We rely on each other for survival,

288
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:48,110
and we leave Linfen together.

289
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:54,200
Leave here?

290
00:15:56,470 --> 00:15:57,960
Where can we go?

291
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,000
Taiyuan.

292
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,470
What's wrong, Miaocui?

293
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:07,910
Nothing.

294
00:16:09,590 --> 00:16:10,670
It's nothing.

295
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:16,960
Luo Shu,

296
00:16:17,590 --> 00:16:18,880
after you leave Linfen,

297
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,790
go as far as you can,

298
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,200
don't go back to Taiyuan.

299
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,470
Don't trust anyone,

300
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:24,520
except yourself.

301
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:26,880
Why?

302
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:30,080
You don't want to go to Taiyuan?

303
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:35,200
Where are you planning to go?

304
00:16:35,350 --> 00:16:36,470
Where else can I go?

305
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:37,840
I was

306
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:39,590
just teasing her.

307
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,110
Miaocui,

308
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,280
you've got

309
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:43,670
quite a few guests today.

310
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:44,960
Go get dressed.

311
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,550
Don't let them wait.

312
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,080
Chief Luo,

313
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,640
it's getting late.

314
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:51,640
You have your own business,

315
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:52,790
and she has her job.

316
00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:54,590
Since you've met,

317
00:16:54,590 --> 00:16:56,350
don't waste time chatting anymore.

318
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:59,150
Madam, I'm gonna...

319
00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:00,760
Mingke House is my home.

320
00:17:01,590 --> 00:17:03,000
I'm fine here.

321
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,070
I'm not going anywhere.

322
00:17:07,070 --> 00:17:08,920
You don't have to worry about me,

323
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:10,000
and you don't need to

324
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,470
come to see me again.

325
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:12,760
Everyone has their own way of living.

326
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:13,920
I'm good.

327
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:14,800
Miaocui.

328
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Just go.

329
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,880
Stop showing off in front of me.

330
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:29,760
Miaocui,

331
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,640
if you have difficulties,
go to the yamen.

332
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:33,400
Magistrate Han and people there

333
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,400
are all my friends.

334
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:36,000
They will help you seek justice.

335
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,400
You don't have to be afraid.

336
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:38,590
Chief Luo,

337
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:41,280
an hour has already passed.

338
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,430
Don't waste my time.

339
00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:13,830
How about letting Luo Shu

340
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:14,800
spend the New Year at my house?

341
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:15,310
In our free time,

342
00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:16,590
we can play Go

343
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:17,470
and read medical books,

344
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:18,430
or

345
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:19,040
we can also

346
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:20,470
talk about autopsy

347
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:22,230
and detective skills.

348
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:23,430
Stop it.

349
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:24,040
On ordinary days,

350
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:25,280
it's already exhausting

351
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,400
to tackle one case after another.

352
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:26,950
It's the New Year.

353
00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:28,430
Can't you let her have a break?

354
00:18:28,430 --> 00:18:29,590
Talk about autopsy?

355
00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:30,160
How could you come up with that?

356
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:30,950
So what now?

357
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:32,040
She can only go to your house?

358
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:33,110
Of course.

359
00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:33,920
It'll be the best choice for Luo Shu

360
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,560
to spend the New Year at my house.

361
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:36,160
Think about it.

362
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,160
On normal days,

363
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,280
Luo Shu is like

364
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:39,230
my younger sister.

365
00:18:39,230 --> 00:18:39,760
Besides,

366
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,160
my little sister Baozi

367
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,000
will keep Luo Shu company.

368
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:42,800
I'll make sure

369
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,070
she has a comfortable time.

370
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:44,640
Yeah.

371
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:45,800
I can also cook delicious food

372
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:47,000
with Miss Luo.

373
00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:47,640
Yeah.

374
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:48,470
All you care about is eating.

375
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:49,800
Stop arguing.

376
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:52,040
Luo Shu is gonna leave Linfen.

377
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:53,710
What?

378
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:54,680
Leave?

379
00:18:55,710 --> 00:18:56,400
What?

380
00:18:57,310 --> 00:18:58,110
Mr. Chen,

381
00:18:58,800 --> 00:18:59,880
you're not kidding, are you?

382
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:00,590
When have you ever seen me

383
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:01,710
kid around with you?

384
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Luo Shu can't leave.

385
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:10,830
She is

386
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:11,920
my best constable.

387
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,110
Without her,

388
00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:14,160
I couldn't have

389
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,000
solved those cases

390
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:15,830
so smoothly.

391
00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:16,560
Right.

392
00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:18,110
I've been thinking about
taking her as my student.

393
00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:19,110
She is really talented,

394
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:20,070
and that's truly exceptional.

395
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:21,680
I already treat Miss Luo

396
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:22,760
as my own sister.

397
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,160
Why is she leaving?

398
00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:25,160
When she comes back,

399
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:26,640
let's persuade her to stay.

400
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:27,280
Okay.

401
00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:29,400
You all know Luo Shu

402
00:19:29,470 --> 00:19:31,040
better than I do.

403
00:19:31,190 --> 00:19:32,640
She has made up her mind.

404
00:19:32,710 --> 00:19:34,430
Who can stop her?

405
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,760
Instead of being sad
and trying to keep her,

406
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,470
we should happily bless her,

407
00:19:38,830 --> 00:19:40,880
let her go where she wants to go

408
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,760
and live the life she wants.

409
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:54,710
Have a look.

410
00:19:55,310 --> 00:19:56,640
Delicious wheat noodles.

411
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,710
Excuse me, are you Miss Luo?

412
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:00,950
Who are you?

413
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:01,800
Sorry to bother you.

414
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:02,640
An old friend

415
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,110
wants to have a few words with you.

416
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:05,560
Old friend?

417
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:06,520
This way, please.

418
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:07,920
Let me wrap it for you.

419
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:18,950
Miss Luo.

420
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,280
Mr. Li.

421
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:21,830
Please have a seat.

422
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:26,760
Master has learned that

423
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:28,800
you have left Mingke House.

424
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:30,520
He's really happy for you.

425
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:31,950
Thanks.

426
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,520
Master sent me to

427
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:35,160
pick you up for the New Year.

428
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:38,230
Please tell Master Qin,

429
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:39,470
I'm doing well

430
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:40,920
and don't waste a thought

431
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:42,160
on me.

432
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:48,560
Carry in.

433
00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:51,760
Be careful with the liquor.

434
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:54,920
Be careful.

435
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:00,710
Luo Shu, come and help me out.

436
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:04,040
Come on, Luo Shu.

437
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:04,760
Come on.

438
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:09,280
What are you doing?

439
00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:10,400
It's for the New Year.

440
00:21:10,430 --> 00:21:11,710
I'm gonna be here for the New Year.

441
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:17,590
I can do this.

442
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,230
Let go, I can handle it.

443
00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:20,230
Come on you can't.

444
00:21:20,710 --> 00:21:21,640
Miss Luo.

445
00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:25,310
You're back.

446
00:21:25,470 --> 00:21:26,950
What are we having today?

447
00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:29,280
I made your favorite

448
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,350
oil residue stuffed buns

449
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:31,830
for you to eat on the way.

450
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:32,830
Thank you.

451
00:21:33,430 --> 00:21:34,830
I hate to let you go.

452
00:21:38,110 --> 00:21:39,110
On the way?

453
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:40,040
Where...

454
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:41,310
where are you going?

455
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,430
I bought some meat dishes
from Deyilou Resturant.

456
00:21:44,430 --> 00:21:45,000
You...

457
00:21:45,310 --> 00:21:46,110
Mr. Qi,

458
00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:48,040
are you also here to send Miss Luo off?

459
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:48,680
I...

460
00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:51,680
Dabing really

461
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:52,880
spent a lot for this meal.

462
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:54,400
Aren't you the same?

463
00:21:55,470 --> 00:21:57,110
Where are you going?

464
00:21:57,950 --> 00:21:58,760
Taiyuan.

465
00:22:02,430 --> 00:22:03,920
Lianshu, prepare the carriage.

466
00:22:04,350 --> 00:22:05,070
Yes, Young Master.

467
00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:06,190
Aren't you going to stay here

468
00:22:06,190 --> 00:22:07,190
for the New Year?

469
00:22:07,190 --> 00:22:09,000
That's because I thought you were...

470
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:11,000
Anyway,

471
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,640
my family has been asking me
to go back to Taiyuan,

472
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:13,830
so we're going the same way.

473
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:15,920
Forget about it.

474
00:22:15,950 --> 00:22:17,070
Every time we travel together,

475
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:18,350
we end up having an argument.

476
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:19,640
To avoid hurting our feelings,

477
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:20,590
it's better for us to go separately.

478
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:21,400
Don't worry,

479
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:23,000
I promise I won't talk to you.

480
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:23,830
If you don't believe me,

481
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:25,800
I'll sew my mouth shut.

482
00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:28,520
Baozi, where is your sewing basket?

483
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:29,710
What for?

484
00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:31,280
Didn't Mr. Qi just say

485
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:32,520
that he would sew his mouth shut?

486
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:33,160
I...

487
00:22:33,830 --> 00:22:34,880
Mr. Qi, wait,

488
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,070
I'll go get it for you.

489
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,310
Wait,

490
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,520
I was just kidding.

491
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:39,560
Why are you so serious?

492
00:22:40,710 --> 00:22:41,470
I was also kidding.

493
00:22:42,430 --> 00:22:43,560
Come and get it.

494
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:49,710
[Linfen Yamen]
Luo Shu, Mr. Qi, take care.

495
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:51,520
Take care, Xu.

496
00:22:52,190 --> 00:22:53,760
If you need anything,

497
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:55,040
just write to us.

498
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:56,590
Thank you, Mr. Chen.

499
00:22:59,110 --> 00:22:59,950
Commandant Qi,

500
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:03,230
protect Luo Shu.

501
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:04,950
Don't worry.

502
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,310
Miss Luo,

503
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:13,560
remember to come back to see me.

504
00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:20,310
Take care, everyone.

505
00:23:21,430 --> 00:23:22,230
I should get going.

506
00:23:23,190 --> 00:23:24,000
Take care.

507
00:23:24,190 --> 00:23:25,000
Take care.

508
00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:26,350
Take care.

509
00:23:27,710 --> 00:23:28,520
Let's go.

510
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:02,040
Luo Shu is gone.

511
00:24:33,190 --> 00:24:34,000
Lianshu,

512
00:24:34,950 --> 00:24:35,520
go.

513
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:54,220
[Taiyuan]

514
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:57,560
Excuse me, I'd like to book a room.

515
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:00,040
Sorry, all the rooms are taken.

516
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:00,950
All the rooms?

517
00:25:01,230 --> 00:25:01,920
Yes.

518
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:04,000
How about you check other inns?

519
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:06,350
Let's go check other inns.

520
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:08,280
Goodbye.

521
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:09,470
We don't need a superior room.

522
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:10,800
I'm really sorry.

523
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,000
Even the storage room is taken,

524
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,350
let alone the superior room.

525
00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:16,760
Let's go.

526
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:18,430
I'm sorry.

527
00:25:19,230 --> 00:25:20,520
You don't need to go check.

528
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:22,230
Right now in Taiyuan,

529
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:23,800
not a single room is available.

530
00:25:28,430 --> 00:25:29,280
Goodbye.

531
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:32,160
Did you do this on purpose?

532
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:35,920
What does it have to do with me?

533
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:36,710
It's the New Year.

534
00:25:36,710 --> 00:25:37,680
Everyone's gone home.

535
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:39,110
How could all inns be fully booked?

536
00:25:39,230 --> 00:25:40,470
It's prosperous here.

537
00:25:40,470 --> 00:25:41,520
Even during the New Year,

538
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:43,230
there are many people staying overnight.

539
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,230
Anyway,

540
00:25:44,230 --> 00:25:45,520
you have nowhere to go today,

541
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:46,800
how about coming home with me?

542
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:49,590
If you feel awkward,

543
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:51,160
you can give me the money

544
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:52,590
and treat my house as an inn.

545
00:25:52,590 --> 00:25:53,520
You can leave anytime you want.

546
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,070
I live in a separate garden.

547
00:25:55,070 --> 00:25:56,000
If you stay with me there,

548
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:56,760
you won't meet strange people

549
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:58,430
and won't be disturbed.

550
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:01,400
Young Master.

551
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:02,680
Young Master.

552
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:04,680
Young Master.

553
00:26:04,710 --> 00:26:05,590
Everything in the garden

554
00:26:05,590 --> 00:26:06,800
is prepared.

555
00:26:06,830 --> 00:26:08,190
The fruits and snacks
in the warm chamber

556
00:26:08,190 --> 00:26:09,040
are all set out,

557
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:10,310
just waiting for you to return.

558
00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:11,040
Good.

559
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:13,640
It's cold outside.

560
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:14,640
Don't stand here.

561
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:15,310
Let's go.

562
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:16,280
But...

563
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:17,520
You're bringing a woman back.

564
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:18,920
How will you explain to your family?

565
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:20,560
You realize you're a woman, don't you?

566
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:22,520
Look at how you're dressed.

567
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,470
When I go back,

568
00:26:24,470 --> 00:26:26,520
I'll just say you're one of my men
of Pingyangwei.

569
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:27,190
Let's go.

570
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:36,680
Mr. Menglin is back.

571
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:38,560
Go to report to Her Ladyship.

572
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:39,190
Okay.

573
00:26:49,310 --> 00:26:49,950
Be careful.

574
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,710
We've arrived, this is my home.

575
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:53,950
[Qi Mansion]
Her Ladyship sent us here

576
00:26:53,950 --> 00:26:55,070
[Qi Mansion]
to wait for you before dawn.

577
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:57,000
She has been waiting for you eagerly.

578
00:26:58,280 --> 00:26:58,950
Alright.

579
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:00,000
I'll go pay respects

580
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:00,520
to my grandmother first.

581
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:01,280
Lian Shu

582
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:02,400
will take you to my room to rest.

583
00:27:02,470 --> 00:27:03,430
I'll be back.

584
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:06,920
Chief Luo, please.

585
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:10,350
Father,

586
00:27:10,950 --> 00:27:11,590
has it really come to

587
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:13,000
the point of cutting ties?

588
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,400
Yes, Father,

589
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:17,590
our salt and iron business

590
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:19,880
hasn't had big troubles in these years.

591
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:22,310
What do you know?

592
00:27:22,710 --> 00:27:24,040
There weren't big troubles before,

593
00:27:24,710 --> 00:27:26,710
doesn't mean there
won't be any in the future.

594
00:27:28,110 --> 00:27:29,590
Cutting ties now

595
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:33,350
might already be too late.

596
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:36,280
Take a look at this letter.

597
00:27:42,430 --> 00:27:43,760
The imperial court
is about to take actions?

598
00:27:45,310 --> 00:27:47,160
Can we trust Minister Hu's words?

599
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:48,710
He and I

600
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:50,110
are sworn brothers.

601
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:51,920
Dealing with the current crisis

602
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,000
is already tricky enough.

603
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:55,680
We must stop the business immediately.

604
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:00,070
Got it.

605
00:28:01,830 --> 00:28:04,880
[Qin's Grain Shop]
Please spare some change.

606
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:11,590
Here comes your food.

607
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:12,070
Okay.

608
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:13,520
Eat this.

609
00:28:13,710 --> 00:28:14,400
Enjoy your meal.

610
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:15,430
[Qin's Grain Shop]
Try this one.

611
00:28:15,430 --> 00:28:17,190
[Qin's Grain Shop]
Have mercy on me.

612
00:28:17,190 --> 00:28:18,310
[Qin's Grain Shop]
Give me some food, please.

613
00:28:18,310 --> 00:28:19,040
Go away.

614
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:20,160
Go away.

615
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:21,950
Please give me some food.

616
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:23,070
No, go away.

617
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:26,820
[Qin's Grain Shop]

618
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:43,280
Poor little thing,

619
00:28:47,710 --> 00:28:48,950
don't cry.

620
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:51,470
Come with me.

621
00:28:52,830 --> 00:28:53,590
In my home,

622
00:28:53,590 --> 00:28:54,950
I have delicious food,

623
00:28:55,190 --> 00:28:56,680
and beautiful clothes.

624
00:28:57,310 --> 00:28:58,070
From now on,

625
00:28:58,070 --> 00:28:59,830
no one will bully you anymore.

626
00:29:19,070 --> 00:29:20,000
Over here.

627
00:29:22,950 --> 00:29:23,880
Lian Shu, you're back.

628
00:29:23,950 --> 00:29:24,830
Lian Shu, you're back.

629
00:29:24,830 --> 00:29:25,640
You're back.

630
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:26,400
Yes.

631
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,160
Lian Shu, you're back.

632
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:28,400
Lian Shu, you're back.

633
00:29:30,190 --> 00:29:31,000
Lian Shu.

634
00:29:33,830 --> 00:29:35,040
Mr. Fengzhou,

635
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:36,190
wish you all the blessings.

636
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:37,880
Is Menglin back?

637
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:39,110
Yes.

638
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:41,040
Young Master has gone
to pay respects to Her Ladyship.

639
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:45,470
Who are you?

640
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:47,800
Mr. Fengzhou,

641
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:48,950
this is Young Master's friend.

642
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:51,470
Friend?

643
00:29:52,070 --> 00:29:53,430
It's rare for this silly boy

644
00:29:53,430 --> 00:29:54,430
to make friends.

645
00:29:56,710 --> 00:29:57,520
Where are you from?

646
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:00,710
Fengzhou.

647
00:30:01,430 --> 00:30:02,230
Fengzhou.

648
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:03,760
Slow down.

649
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:04,830
Watch your manners.

650
00:30:05,310 --> 00:30:07,310
Fengzhou, how have you been recently?

651
00:30:09,350 --> 00:30:10,040
You're

652
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:11,430
the Deputy Commandant
of Pingyangwei now.

653
00:30:11,590 --> 00:30:13,160
You should be more stable
in your words and actions,

654
00:30:13,230 --> 00:30:14,310
and strive for self-improvement.

655
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:15,520
Don't make Father and me

656
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:16,350
worry about you.

657
00:30:16,350 --> 00:30:17,310
I know.

658
00:30:17,590 --> 00:30:18,430
Having a father

659
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:19,680
who nags me every day

660
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:20,640
is enough.

661
00:30:21,190 --> 00:30:21,760
As for you,

662
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:22,710
get some rest

663
00:30:22,710 --> 00:30:23,710
and stop nagging me.

664
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:25,800
You mischievous one.

665
00:30:38,950 --> 00:30:39,590
Let's go.

666
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:44,000
Young Master, you're back.

667
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:44,640
Young Master,

668
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,070
There's some freshly arrived Zisun tea.

669
00:30:46,070 --> 00:30:46,950
Let me make tea for you.

670
00:30:46,950 --> 00:30:48,470
Young Master, are you tired?

671
00:30:53,470 --> 00:30:55,190
Young Master, are you hungry?

672
00:30:55,190 --> 00:30:56,710
What did you have for lunch?

673
00:30:56,950 --> 00:30:58,040
I'm not hungry.

674
00:30:59,230 --> 00:31:00,680
Make two cups of Zisun tea.

675
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:02,040
Young Master, I want some too.

676
00:31:02,430 --> 00:31:03,230
Three cups then.

677
00:31:03,470 --> 00:31:04,350
Sit here.

678
00:31:04,590 --> 00:31:05,640
Three cups of Zisun tea.

679
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:06,640
Young Master, hot towels are here.

680
00:31:11,350 --> 00:31:13,070
Young Master, you haven't told us

681
00:31:13,070 --> 00:31:14,800
who this young lady is?

682
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:17,000
No wonder now

683
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,680
you don't even want to go home.

684
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:20,070
Turns out,

685
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:22,350
you got someone you care about outside.

686
00:31:22,350 --> 00:31:23,110
Stop it.

687
00:31:23,470 --> 00:31:24,280
Don't worry,

688
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:25,070
we're just

689
00:31:25,070 --> 00:31:27,040
chatting about it in our garden.

690
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:28,000
When we go outside,

691
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,470
we'll definitely zip our lips.

692
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:31,000
You can't say that
no matter where you are.

693
00:31:31,070 --> 00:31:32,430
She's my friend from Linfen.

694
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:33,310
You

695
00:31:33,310 --> 00:31:34,560
just serve her well.

696
00:31:35,190 --> 00:31:35,640
Alright.

697
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:36,430
Got it.

698
00:31:36,430 --> 00:31:37,880
Young Master, here's Zisun tea.

699
00:31:42,190 --> 00:31:43,000
Young Master.

700
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:45,520
Try it, it's good.

701
00:31:46,430 --> 00:31:47,230
Young Master,

702
00:31:47,310 --> 00:31:49,430
what should we call this lady?

703
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:50,640
My name is Luo Shu.

704
00:31:51,590 --> 00:31:53,190
How about

705
00:31:53,190 --> 00:31:54,280
we call her Mr. Luo?

706
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:55,310
Okay.

707
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:56,920
Go prepare the bedding for her.

708
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:57,760
She'll sleep here tonight.

709
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:01,350
In the side room.

710
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:05,040
Don't go to bed too early tonight.

711
00:32:05,350 --> 00:32:06,190
We have something fun planned.

712
00:32:10,830 --> 00:32:11,800
I'm sorry, Master.

713
00:32:11,950 --> 00:32:13,830
I screwed up the task.

714
00:32:13,830 --> 00:32:15,000
Please punish me.

715
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:16,350
Did the person from the Qi family

716
00:32:16,350 --> 00:32:17,710
really say that?

717
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:19,070
Yes.

718
00:32:19,950 --> 00:32:20,950
He said that

719
00:32:21,470 --> 00:32:22,950
this year was different.

720
00:32:23,190 --> 00:32:23,880
If we want to collect the goods,

721
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:25,830
we must have
Governor Qi's personal order.

722
00:32:26,230 --> 00:32:27,040
Or,

723
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:28,310
we won't be able to get

724
00:32:28,310 --> 00:32:29,230
a single packet of salt
or a piece of iron.

725
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:31,310
Did they take the money?

726
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:32,430
No.

727
00:32:33,230 --> 00:32:34,830
I followed old rules,

728
00:32:35,110 --> 00:32:37,000
preparing a generous gift
to their mansion.

729
00:32:49,310 --> 00:32:51,280
Times are getting tough.

730
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:53,920
It's going to be more difficult

731
00:32:54,710 --> 00:32:56,310
to do business from now on.

732
00:32:58,560 --> 00:32:59,830
What should we do?

733
00:33:02,350 --> 00:33:03,560
You may leave now.

734
00:33:05,070 --> 00:33:05,880
Got it.

735
00:33:19,070 --> 00:33:21,950
Master, here is the little girl.

736
00:33:34,590 --> 00:33:35,430
Here you are.

737
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:41,190
How does it taste?

738
00:33:43,590 --> 00:33:44,560
From now on,

739
00:33:45,110 --> 00:33:46,880
this is your home, okay?

740
00:34:02,310 --> 00:34:03,110
Yanjin.

741
00:34:03,710 --> 00:34:04,520
Yanjin.

742
00:34:04,590 --> 00:34:05,310
Yanjin.

743
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:06,680
Menglin.

744
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:08,040
Mr. Menglin.

745
00:34:08,150 --> 00:34:08,870
Lian Qi.

746
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:10,150
Yanjin.

747
00:34:10,150 --> 00:34:11,000
I heard from the family

748
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:11,710
that you're back.

749
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,150
I'm really tied up.

750
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:14,710
I was planning to see you.

751
00:34:14,710 --> 00:34:15,600
I know you're busy.

752
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:16,950
That's why I'm here to see you.

753
00:34:18,950 --> 00:34:20,280
You've been away from home for so long.

754
00:34:20,470 --> 00:34:22,430
Are you getting used to life in Linfen?

755
00:34:22,950 --> 00:34:24,470
Is Lian Shu

756
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:25,910
taking good care of you?

757
00:34:25,910 --> 00:34:26,840
Of course.

758
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:27,910
Everything is fine.

759
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:29,320
Yanjin,

760
00:34:29,710 --> 00:34:31,470
you're the busiest one all year round.

761
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:32,280
You've been working so hard.

762
00:34:32,630 --> 00:34:34,080
Father and Fengzhou

763
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:35,560
have to deal with official matters.

764
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:37,000
Now that you've also become an official,

765
00:34:37,230 --> 00:34:39,280
you and Fengzhou will
support each other in the future

766
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,190
to bring honor to our family.

767
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:41,950
I'll take care of

768
00:34:41,950 --> 00:34:43,190
these family matters

769
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:45,080
so that you won't have any worries.

770
00:34:45,390 --> 00:34:46,230
I understand.

771
00:34:46,230 --> 00:34:47,190
Thank you, Yanjin.

772
00:34:47,630 --> 00:34:48,430
Mr. Yanjin.

773
00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:52,430
Mr. Yanjin. Mr. Menglin.

774
00:34:52,870 --> 00:34:54,560
This is the gift list from
the Su family of Yongyang Trading House.

775
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:55,870
Give it to me.

776
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:02,190
An agate inkstone
with the design of sea.

777
00:35:02,470 --> 00:35:05,190
Two pairs of luminous glaze cups.

778
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:08,150
A sheep-fat white jade crescent pendant,

779
00:35:08,150 --> 00:35:10,470
glowing in the dark.

780
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:13,120
I'm not as reckless as you,

781
00:35:13,910 --> 00:35:15,150
because you're born in the Qi family.

782
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:16,800
You spend lavishly,

783
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,120
but every coin you spend

784
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:19,430
is the hard-earned money
of the common people.

785
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:20,390
You don't need to know

786
00:35:20,390 --> 00:35:21,710
what hardships are like,

787
00:35:21,710 --> 00:35:23,630
so you don't need to be cautious.

788
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:25,470
You just said shamelessly

789
00:35:25,470 --> 00:35:26,670
that you are not

790
00:35:26,670 --> 00:35:27,630
a hesitant person.

791
00:35:28,390 --> 00:35:29,150
But without

792
00:35:29,150 --> 00:35:31,280
your family supporting you,

793
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:32,870
you're nobody.

794
00:35:33,430 --> 00:35:35,360
Where would your confidence come from?

795
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:38,120
Yanjin,

796
00:35:39,190 --> 00:35:41,520
those gifts are truly generous.

797
00:35:42,470 --> 00:35:43,560
They give us every year.

798
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:44,800
If we don't accept,

799
00:35:45,430 --> 00:35:46,630
how can they feel relieved?

800
00:35:49,710 --> 00:35:50,840
Only when we accept the gifts,

801
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:52,390
will they put their minds at ease.

802
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:53,670
It's beneficial for both sides.

803
00:35:53,870 --> 00:35:54,910
If we refuse,

804
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:56,230
they will think

805
00:35:56,230 --> 00:35:58,150
that our family looks down on them

806
00:35:58,150 --> 00:35:59,390
and rejects them.

807
00:35:59,710 --> 00:36:02,000
Then they won't even enjoy the New Year.

808
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:30,630
Mr. Luo.

809
00:36:30,870 --> 00:36:32,470
Mr. Luo. It's Xue Zhu.

810
00:36:32,710 --> 00:36:34,000
Are you still awake?

811
00:36:34,470 --> 00:36:36,320
Mr. Luo, come out.

812
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:37,600
I need to talk to you.

813
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:38,910
Come out.

814
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:45,560
Happy New Year.

815
00:36:57,910 --> 00:37:00,320
Mr. Luo, it's rare for Young Master
to come back.

816
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:01,520
Let's go have some fun.

817
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:01,910
Go.

818
00:37:01,910 --> 00:37:03,120
Let's have some fun.

819
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:04,710
Let's go.

820
00:37:04,710 --> 00:37:06,040
Have some fun.

821
00:37:06,670 --> 00:37:07,470
Let's go.

822
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,080
It's rare for Young Master to come back.

823
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:10,670
So I propose

824
00:37:10,670 --> 00:37:12,630
we all make a toast to Young Master.

825
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:13,280
Cheers.

826
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:14,950
Welcome home.

827
00:37:15,470 --> 00:37:17,230
Just drinking is boring.

828
00:37:17,230 --> 00:37:18,910
How about we play dice?

829
00:37:18,910 --> 00:37:19,910
Whoever loses drinks.

830
00:37:19,910 --> 00:37:21,390
Sounds good.

831
00:37:21,390 --> 00:37:22,040
I'll go first.

832
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:26,360
Six!

833
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:27,360
Impressive.

834
00:37:27,430 --> 00:37:28,670
Mr. Luo.

835
00:37:28,670 --> 00:37:29,870
Mr. Luo, it's your turn.

836
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:36,760
One. You lost.

837
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:37,630
Mr. Luo lost.

838
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:38,670
Drink up.

839
00:37:38,670 --> 00:37:39,470
Drink.

840
00:37:39,630 --> 00:37:40,600
Drink.

841
00:37:40,870 --> 00:37:42,150
Mr. Luo, drink up.

842
00:37:42,150 --> 00:37:42,950
I'll drink for her.

843
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,560
This is Mr. Luo's punishment.

844
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:46,760
You can't do that.

845
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:48,230
You can't cheat.

846
00:37:48,430 --> 00:37:49,280
I suggest

847
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:51,040
they all have a drink.

848
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:52,280
Yeah, right.

849
00:37:52,430 --> 00:37:53,120
What kind of rule is that?

850
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,360
You can't cheat anymore.

851
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:55,520
Alright, I'll drink.

852
00:37:58,230 --> 00:38:00,000
Mr. Luo is straightforward.

853
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:00,910
So cool.

854
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:02,470
Mr. Luo is so straightforward.

855
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:07,430
Mine is the highest.

856
00:38:07,430 --> 00:38:08,520
Come on, your turn.

857
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:09,600
I'm definitely gonna lose.

858
00:38:10,390 --> 00:38:11,230
Drink.

859
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:12,670
Drink.

860
00:38:12,670 --> 00:38:13,670
Young Master, drink for me.

861
00:38:13,670 --> 00:38:14,800
Young Master, drink for her.

862
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,080
Young Master, it's not fair.

863
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,320
Mr. Luo, drink.

864
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:19,950
Let's drink.

865
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:21,000

Young Master.

910
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:25,910
You're awake.

911
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:28,710
What's your plan for today?

912
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:30,800
I want to take a walk.

913
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:33,840
I'm tied up today,

914
00:41:33,870 --> 00:41:35,760
how about Xuezhu and other girls
accompanying you?

915
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:37,080
So you won't be bored alone.

916
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:38,120
No need.

917
00:41:38,230 --> 00:41:39,670
I'll just walk around.

918
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:41,520
It'll be inconvenient for me
with someone else.

919
00:41:42,390 --> 00:41:43,470
Where are you headed?

920
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:44,390
I'll take you there.

921
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:46,120
Don't you have something to do?

922
00:41:46,630 --> 00:41:47,520
Don't delay it.

923
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:48,950
It's nothing important.

924
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:51,560
Just a bunch of friends

925
00:41:51,950 --> 00:41:52,910
asking me to hang out.

926
00:41:54,950 --> 00:41:55,710
I'm not going out

927
00:41:55,710 --> 00:41:56,800
to live it up.

928
00:41:57,390 --> 00:41:58,910
Just some old friends.

929
00:41:58,910 --> 00:41:59,950
They heard I'm back

930
00:41:59,950 --> 00:42:01,360
and want to catch up with me.

931
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:03,190
You have old friends

932
00:42:03,190 --> 00:42:04,150
in Taiyuan?

933
00:42:04,430 --> 00:42:05,520
Of course.

934
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:07,560
My father was an official here

935
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:09,000
a decade ago.

936
00:42:09,150 --> 00:42:10,150
I lived here

937
00:42:10,150 --> 00:42:11,190
for several years as well.

938
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:11,910
So,

939
00:42:11,910 --> 00:42:13,430
we kind of share a hometown.

940

[Polish Conduct and Reputation]
If you encounter any trouble,

942
00:42:20,950 --> 00:42:22,040
[Polish Conduct and Reputation]
just mention my name.

My name in Taiyuan

944
00:42:23,630 --> 00:42:24,560
[Polish Conduct and Reputation]
still carries some weight.

945
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,670

I got it, Mr. Qi.

946
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:35,230
Master, we've arrived.

947
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:55,520
