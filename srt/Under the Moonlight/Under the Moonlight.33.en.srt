"Jin Nang" by Shui He]

[Episode 33]

4
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:34,720
As a magistrate,

5
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:36,830
Han Muzhi came to Taiyuan

6
00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:38,190
to request grain for the people.

7
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:40,080
He came twice.

8
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:42,190
But what about you, Father?

9
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,800
You refused to give him any grain.

10
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:46,040
Is it really because

11
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,360
the disaster in Linfen isn't severe?

12
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:48,510
Is it really because

13
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:50,120
the relief grain hasn't arrived yet?

14
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,480
Don't you think

15
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:56,310
that your actions are out of line?

16
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:05,360
Wan,

17
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:10,000
Han Muzhi

18
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,030
is uncontrollable.

19
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:13,800
Look at what he wrote.

20
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,190
Every word shows his discontent

21
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,160
and his shame
in being associated with us.

22
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:20,520
How can someone like that

23
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,960
join our Liu family?

24
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,600
If you marry him,

25
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,390
can he treat you well?

26
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:26,830
He just doesn't want to get involved

27
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:28,550
in the tricks of the official world.

28
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:31,630
I admire and appreciate him,

29
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:32,390
for his

30
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:33,520
integrity

31
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,240
and purity.

32
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:36,880
If I have to marry someone

33
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:37,880
who's just a yes-man,

34
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,360
climbing up

35
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,880
by flattering others,

36
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,830
I'd rather stay single forever.

37
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:46,630
How outrageous!

38
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,030
If you want to ruin

39
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:55,390
my marriage to Han Muzhi,

40
00:02:57,190 --> 00:02:58,550
I'll shave my head and become a nun,

41
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:01,030

42
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:03,320
devoted to the Buddha.

Young Master.

44
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:36,630
Should I go in first

45
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:37,960
to gather some intelligence?

46
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:38,630
No.

47
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:39,800
Trying to probe now

48
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,160
is like walking into a trap.

Hurry up.

52
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,000
This way.

53
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,640
Go with Luo Shu.

54
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:23,600
I'm not here to run away.

55
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:25,790
- Young Master.
- Be careful.

56
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,070
You can really throw a punch!

59
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:35,200
What are you doing here?

60
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:36,640
Take them away.

61
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:37,270
Yes.

62
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:38,790
Do you know what happened to my family?

63
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,270
Your father and family members

64
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:41,550
have already been taken to the capital.

65
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:42,670
It's so fast.

66
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:43,950
Mr. Sun,

67
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,320
we're back this time

68
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:46,880
to get to the bottom of this

69
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,600
and find evidence
to clear the Qi family's name.

70
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:50,790
Taiyuan now

71
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:52,390

72

Trying to clear the Qi family's name

73
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:54,830
is harder than climbing to heaven.

74
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:57,200
You need to plan this carefully.

75
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:58,440
I'm from the Qi family.

76
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:00,350
Even if it costs me my life,

77
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:01,670
I won't back down.

78
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,230
If you need my help,

79
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,270
just let me know.

80
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:08,920
They've already slipped into Taiyuan.

81
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:09,640
And you didn't notice anything

82
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:10,720
from the gate tower?

83
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:12,480
I admit I'm incompetent.

84
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:13,880
You're really incompetent.

85
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,070
There are so many eyes
at the entrance of the Qi mansion,

86
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:16,550
but you

87
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:18,270
let Qi Menglin slip away.

88
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:25,230
Considering our years together,

89
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:28,160
I'll let this go this time.

90
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,350
I'll give you another chance.

91
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,670
If you mess up again,

92
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:35,270
you know the consequences.

93
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:36,950
I understand.

94
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,510
Get out.

95
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:55,390
Be careful, Young Master.

96
00:05:58,270 --> 00:05:59,070
This way.

97
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:05,270
This way, Young Master.

98
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:07,720
Watch out.

99
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:19,200
Right there.

100
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,950
Young Master, Miss Luo, please.

101
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,110
Over here.

102
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:52,760
This is your home?

103
00:06:55,230 --> 00:06:56,320
Didn't you live at my home

104
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,550
when you were a kid?

105
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:03,390
When I was a kid,

106
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:04,880
my family was so poor
that we could hardly eat.

107
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,040
My parents sold me

108
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,230
to your family.

109
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:10,110
They thought
at least I'd get enough to eat.

110
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:11,830
A few years later,

111
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,230
my parents passed away.

112
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,390
I

113
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,440
never cared about

114
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:23,510
your family.

115
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,040
It's okay.

116
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,270
That's all in the past.

117
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:30,040
Young Master,

118
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:32,070
this house has been empty for years.

119
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:33,600
No one knows here.

120
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,880
It's tough for you to stay here.

121
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:37,390
I'm sorry.

122
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:39,510
Even in this mess,

123
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:43,550
you're still with me,

124
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:44,920
through thick and thin.

125
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:52,480
And you took a beating
to protect me.

126
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,480
In the next life,

127
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:03,920
you be the master,

128
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:05,830
and I'll be your servant.

129
00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:11,600
Young Master, please spare me.

130
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:14,160
Your sweet talk is too much.

131
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,160
I have goosebumps all over.

132
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:19,390
Having a place to stay

133
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:20,600
is already great.

134
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,040
I'll go

135
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,550
buy some supplies tomorrow.

136
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:29,270
No candles.

137
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:30,670
This place hasn't been lived in
for a while.

138
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:31,510
If lights suddenly appear,

139
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:32,760
it'll attract attention.

140
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,110
The best way to stay hidden

141
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:35,440
is to keep things the same

142
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:36,910
and limit comings and goings.

143
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:55,230
What are you thinking about?

144
00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:00,440
I'm thinking

145
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,760
about how they got started.

146
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:10,880
Young Master,

147
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,790
you really need to think this through.

148
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:14,670
Misusing military grain
is a serious crime.

149
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:15,590
If you get caught,

150
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:16,960
you could lose your head.

151
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:17,910
Don't worry.

152
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:20,960
My father manages the military grain.

153
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:22,960
Even if I get caught,

154
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:25,150
he'll cover for me.

155
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,550
But what if he doesn't want

156
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:28,080
to help you?

157
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:30,400
I mean,

158
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:31,470
what if he can't

159
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:32,880
help you out?

160
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:36,080
The document is forged by me.

161
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:38,440
The grain is taken by me.

162
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,840
Even if he can't cover for me,

163
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,520
at worst, I'll lose my head.

164
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,400
It's worth

165
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:49,320
risking my life

166
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,030
to save so many others.

167
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,200
Young Master,

168
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,150
stop pretending

169
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:53,320
to be so righteous.

170
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:55,030
Aren't you doing this for Miss Luo?

171
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,150
Those aren't mutually exclusive.

172
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,200
It makes me

173
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,670
want to do this even more.

174
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,640
Young Master, what do you want?

175
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:09,960
Peace of mind.

176
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:11,880
Though I haven't been a commandant

177
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:12,790
for long,

178
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:14,670
I've seen

179
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:16,000
the suffering of the people.

180
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,470
Now that the villagers are in trouble,

181
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:20,520
how can I just stand by?

182
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:23,030
What's more,

183
00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:25,200
I've already vowed with Luo Shu

184
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,230
to be together for life.

185
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:30,200
I can't let her

186
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,590
fight this battle alone.

187
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,550
Young Master, you're so foolish.

188
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Fools have their blessings.

189
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,080
Go quickly.

190
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,000
Get the carts and boats ready

191
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:40,670
for transporting grain.

192
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:41,710
Okay.

[Governor's Warrant]

194
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,470
- Mr. Menglin.
- Mr. Menglin.

195
00:11:56,670 --> 00:11:57,670
What brings you here?

196
00:11:58,790 --> 00:12:00,030
Tonight, we're

197
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:01,280
on duty at Mr. Qi's courtyard.

198
00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:04,550
On duty? That's great!

199
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,440
You all carry on. I'm leaving.

200
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,000
Mr. Menglin,

201
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,110
how come

202
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:10,640
you're in Mr. Qi's courtyard?

203
00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:14,880
How dare you!

204
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:16,670
Who do you think you are to question me?

205
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:18,840
Forgive me, Mr. Menglin.

206
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:22,000
I'm just doing my duty.

207
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,640
Can't I just see my father?

208
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,150
But Mr. Qi said,

209
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:27,790
without his order,

210
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:29,760
no one can enter the study.

211
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:30,640
What do you mean?

212
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:31,760
Are you suspecting

213
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,110
that I'm stealing from the study?

214
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:34,470
No!

215
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:36,470
Mr. Menglin, I didn't mean that at all.

216
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:37,200
Since that's the case,

217
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,350
just get out of the way!

218
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:40,400
I wouldn't dare! This won't do.

219
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:41,790
Do you have any respect for your place?

220
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:44,320
Are you trying to bully Mr. Menglin?

221
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,350
I wouldn't dare!

222
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,200
Mr. Menglin!

223
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:53,200
Well said!

224
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:54,840
Make sure to discipline

225
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,080
these two who lack manners.

226
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,110
Mr. Menglin,

227
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,030
please don't make it hard for us.

228
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:01,280
You two are just waiting

229
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,470
for Mr. Qi to return and judge you,

230
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:03,590
right?

231
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,590
I...

232
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:09,110
I wouldn't dare!

233
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:11,030
Mr. Menglin, I offended you.

234
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:12,670
I was wrong!

235
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:14,000
We both realize our mistakes.

236
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:14,880
So hurry and leave!

237
00:13:15,710 --> 00:13:16,910
Okay! We're going!

238
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,320
Mr. Menglin, do you have something?

239
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:25,910
What could I have?

240
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:27,790
By the way,

241
00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:29,520
where's Yanjin?

242
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:31,400
Why didn't I see him with you?

243
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:33,710
Mr. Yanjin has important business today.

244
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,230
Important business?

245
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:36,440
What's that about?

246
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:38,400
I'm not sure.

247
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:39,880
Why not wait for Mr. Yanjin to come back

248
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:41,150
and ask him yourself?

249
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:42,910
No need for that.

250
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:49,440
If my father and Yanjin

251
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,280
ask about me,

252
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:51,880
just say you haven't seen me today.

253
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,080
Yes, Mr. Menglin.

254
00:13:58,910 --> 00:14:00,230
By order of Governor Qi,

255
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,670
I'm here to requisition some grain.

256
00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:10,880
Who are you?

257
00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:13,350
I'm Governor Qi's third son, Qi Menglin.

258
00:14:13,590 --> 00:14:14,280
Please, Mr. Menglin.

259
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:14,910
Wait.

260
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:18,230
What's going on here?

261
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:20,640
This is an official business.

262
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,350
Why would Governor Qi

263
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,000
send Mr. Menglin to requisition grain?

264
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,280
Besides, this document

265
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:27,200
[Governor's Warrant]
is not in the governor's handwriting.

266
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:29,840
Do you recognize
the Governor Qi's handwriting?

267
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,880
I used to be a personal retainer
of Governor Qi.

268
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,000
Then how can you

269
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,320
not recognize Mr. Menglin?

270
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,470
It's been years since we last met;

271
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:37,440
I might not recognize him.

272
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:39,550
You're overthinking it.

273
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,550
This document
has Governor Qi's official seal.

274
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:42,790
What's more,

275
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:44,670
the son of Governor Qi

276
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:46,400
is not someone we can offend.

277
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:48,470
But if something goes wrong,

278
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:49,960
we won't be able to handle it.

279
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:50,960
What are you mumbling about?

280
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:52,440
Do you want me to have my father

281
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:53,320
come in person?

282
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:56,150
I wouldn't dare.

283
00:14:56,150 --> 00:14:57,030
Hurry and get the grain.

284
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:01,550
Please, Mr. Menglin.

285
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:04,110
Commandant Qi, please.

286
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,840
Be careful, don't spill any.

287
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:15,760
Quick!

288
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:21,030
Take a couple fewer steps. Come on!

289
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Put some more effort in, hurry!

290
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:27,150
You, be careful.

291
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:29,320
Put some more effort in!

292
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:32,880
Looking at it now,

293
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,150
from forging grain requisition document

294
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:36,350
to loading the grain onto the ship,

295
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:39,550
I've interacted with four people.

296
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:43,880
Lian Shu, Lian Qi, the granary officer,

297
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:45,910
and the centurion
who made things difficult for me.

298
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:48,670
Besides Lian Shu,

299
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:50,110
only Lian Qi,

300
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,400
the granary officer,

301
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:52,400
and the centurion are left.

302
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:53,960
Lian Qi and the granary officer

303
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:54,710
are the most suspicious.

304
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:58,910
How do you figure that?

305
00:15:59,150 --> 00:16:00,550
With your status, it's irregular

306
00:16:00,670 --> 00:16:01,960
to requisition grain.

307
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:03,110
That centurion

308
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:04,350
was just doing his job,

309
00:16:04,350 --> 00:16:05,710
asking reasonable questions.

310
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:06,840
But why would the granary officer

311
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,200
speak up for you?

312
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:09,470
Is it just to

313
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:10,590
suck up to you?

314
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:14,840
That could definitely be

315
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:16,840
a possibility.

316
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:18,960
But compared to the heavy crime
of losing grain,

317
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,150
trying to win your favor

318
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:21,470
is not worth the risk.

319
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:29,470
Unusual events must have their causes.

320
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:34,280
You misused military grain,

321
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,400
and then the granary got burned.

322
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:37,960
This clearly shows

323
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,230
someone set this up.

324
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:42,400
Those who seem

325
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,640
to help you

326
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:44,960
are often the most suspicious.

327
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,550
As for Lian Shu,

328
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:47,710
and that centurion,

329
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:49,640
they're either true allies

330
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:50,960
with good intentions

331
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,080
or just neutral outsiders

332
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,670
doing their jobs.

333
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:57,790
But Lian Qi...

334
00:16:58,790 --> 00:16:59,590
Lian Qi.

335
00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:02,440
He's Yanjin's man.

336
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:03,880
Their relationship
is just like mine with Lian Shu.

337
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:06,190
He couldn't possibly be involved.

338
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,350
But since he's Yanjin's man,

339
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:10,230
why was he right there

340
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:11,880
at your father's study?

341
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:14,310
Maybe he was just passing by.

342
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:15,040
Or...

343
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:18,040
Perhaps Yanjin

344
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:19,280
sent him on an errand.

345
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:20,310
Either way,

346
00:17:21,430 --> 00:17:22,710
Lian Qi is reliable.

347
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:25,310
I hope so.

348
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:41,920
Are you scared?

349
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:50,590
Are you really going to be

350
00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:52,000
a coward who just avoids everything?

351
00:17:54,190 --> 00:17:55,950
I just don't want to become corrupt
with this bureaucracy.

352
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:57,560
Do you think

353
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,430
that if you resign
from your official post

354
00:17:59,430 --> 00:18:00,040
and become a

355
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:01,640
carefree teacher,

356
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,280
you can avoid being corrupted

357
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:05,000
and be superior to others?

358
00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:08,160
What else can I do?

359
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:10,470
Follow your father's lead

360
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:12,190
from now on

361
00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:13,800
and be

362
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,880
a puppet for the rest of my life?

363
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:17,310
Of course not.

364
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,160
Governor Qi is indeed corrupt
and abuses his power,

365
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:23,680
but my father shouldn't

366
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:25,110
use innocent lives

367
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:26,920
as weapons against his political rivals.

368
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:29,310
His actions

369
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:31,470
make me furious and disgusted.

370
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:34,310
I just hate that I'm a woman,

371
00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:36,070
unable to influence his decisions.

372
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:37,710
But you, Han Muzhi,

373
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,000
you can do what I can't.

374
00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:41,280
A real man

375
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,520
doesn't have to fight back

376
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:45,800
when insulted,

377
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:47,400
but he should understand

378
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,760
that he holds great power

379
00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:51,830
and has far-reaching ambitions.

380
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:56,880
A true avenger doesn't break his sword.

381
00:18:58,040 --> 00:18:59,190
Even with a grudge,

382
00:19:00,350 --> 00:19:01,470
he doesn't blame the innocent.

383
00:19:02,110 --> 00:19:03,800
You've read so many sages' texts.

384
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:05,350
Was it just to

385
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:06,520
gain fame?

386
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:09,190
Shouldn't you practice what you preach?

387
00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:12,640
What I value

388
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:14,520
has never been your looks

389
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:15,520
or talent.

390
00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:18,190
Others have those too.

391
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:19,710
What I see in you

392
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:21,350
is your unyielding spirit,

393
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,040
your resilience.

394
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:25,280
I saw that from the first time

395
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,470
I met you.

396
00:19:28,190 --> 00:19:29,430
Since you refuse

397
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:30,520
to become corrupt with this bureaucracy,

398
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:32,430
then you should do something

399
00:19:32,430 --> 00:19:33,640
to change it.

400
00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:36,760
But it's too late for me.

401
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:38,760
You shouldn't

402
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,350
make decisions in haste.

403
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:42,800
And you definitely shouldn't

404
00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:48,190
[To Mr. Zhao]
lose your spirit over this resignation.

405
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,960
[To Mr. Zhao]

406
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:58,160
Who really chose me back then,

407
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,830
Mr. Liu or you?

408
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:05,230
It was me.

409
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:08,350
That Han Muzhi, outstanding and unique,

410
00:20:08,830 --> 00:20:11,040
with talent, insight,

411
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:12,760
and character.

412
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:15,590
Sure, he has some talent,

413
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:19,000
but his views are just too extreme.

414
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:21,760
Someone like him

415
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:24,190
needs to be careful;

416
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:26,070
otherwise, he can easily offend others,

417
00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:27,640
which could seriously affect

418
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:29,230
his future career.

419
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,760
I believe

420
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:33,710
with Han Muzhi's character and talent,

421
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:36,000
he definitely has a bright future.

422
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:37,470
What do you know?

423
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,160
The official world is very delicate.

424
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:40,950
One wrong move,

425
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:42,350
and it's hard to recover.

426
00:20:42,430 --> 00:20:43,950
But he has you, right?

427
00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:45,110
If he becomes

428
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:46,040
my husband,

429
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:47,280
with your guidance,

430
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,800
how could he possibly go wrong?

431
00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:50,640
The key is

432
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:51,950
that his views

433
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:53,110
clash

434
00:20:53,110 --> 00:20:54,430
with mine.

435
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,710
The gentleman seeks harmony
but not uniformity.

436
00:20:58,310 --> 00:21:00,310
It's not always the best

437
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:01,590
if he listens to you on everything.

438
00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:04,160
If he doesn't listen, what use is he?

439
00:21:05,310 --> 00:21:06,760
If he ignores me,

440
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:08,590
how can he be part of our Liu family?

441
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:15,830
Have some grapes.

442
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:20,430
Have some grapes and think it over.

443
00:21:20,430 --> 00:21:21,520
Let's switch to someone else.

444
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:26,110
Father, you promised me

445
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:27,350
before

446
00:21:27,350 --> 00:21:29,160
that you'd listen to me this time
about choosing a husband.

447
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:29,950
Why are you

448
00:21:29,950 --> 00:21:31,680
hesitating now

449
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:33,310
that I've chosen Han Muzhi?

450
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:36,190
Am I choosing a son-in-law  for you,

451
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:37,160
or are you choosing

452
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:38,230
a husband for me?

453
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:41,590
Aren't they the same?

454
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:44,520
Father,

455
00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:46,830
are you really going to go back

456
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:48,310
on your word to me?

457
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:51,000
Father.

458
00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:52,190
Alright then.

459
00:21:53,190 --> 00:21:53,920
Alright.

460
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:55,280
Let's go with your choice for now.

461
00:21:55,950 --> 00:21:57,070
But we have to agree.

462
00:21:57,070 --> 00:21:58,520
We must see if this man

463
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:00,000
is someone we can shape

464
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,000
and if he's teachable.

465
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,560
He definitely is.

466
00:22:05,430 --> 00:22:06,350
Over here.

467
00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:21,310
It was so close.

468
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:23,400
It was really so close.

469
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,560
The situation is set.

470
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:40,520
Mr. Liu,
what else is there to worry about?

471
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,190
It's because Wan

472
00:22:42,950 --> 00:22:44,350
has run off to Linfen

473
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:47,160
to find Han Muzhi?

474
00:22:48,830 --> 00:22:50,070
She's grown up.

475
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:52,160
I think

476
00:22:52,310 --> 00:22:53,310
you should

477
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:55,110
settle her marriage soon.

478
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:57,470
That'll save you some worry.

479
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:58,830
Don't you think so?

480
00:22:59,430 --> 00:23:01,160
Han Muzhi is like

481
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,950
a stone in a latrine.

482
00:23:08,710 --> 00:23:09,680
There's a saying

483
00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:12,310
that I'm not sure I should share.

484
00:23:12,830 --> 00:23:14,190
But if I do,

485
00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:14,880
it might look like

486
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:17,310
I'm trying to create a rift
between you and Mr. Han.

487
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:20,680
Go ahead.

488
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:23,760
I've heard that

489
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,110
last time Qin Yi's people

490
00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:27,950
didn't catch Qi Menglin in Linfen.

491
00:23:28,230 --> 00:23:29,470
It might because

492
00:23:29,470 --> 00:23:31,310
Han Muzhi was secretly protecting him.

493
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:34,070
I heard Han Muzhi and Qi Menglin

494
00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:35,880
are quite close.

495
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,880
First, he came to Taiyuan,

496
00:23:41,110 --> 00:23:43,590
and repeatedly asked me for grain.

497
00:23:43,710 --> 00:23:45,040
He doesn't understand
what's important.

498
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:49,470
Then he submitted his resignation
to Mr. Zhao.

499
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:51,280
He's being reckless.

500
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:54,760
Now he's too close with the Qi family.

501
00:23:57,830 --> 00:23:59,350
All of this

502
00:24:00,110 --> 00:24:02,230
is really embarrassing for me.

503
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:06,560
It's tough

504
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:08,760
and really annoying.

505
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:11,280
Forgive me for speaking out of turn,

506
00:24:12,190 --> 00:24:13,520
but Han Muzhi

507
00:24:13,950 --> 00:24:15,710
hasn't even truly married

508
00:24:15,710 --> 00:24:17,280
your daughter yet.

509
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:20,110
So why worry so much?

510
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:25,040
There's still time.

511
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,310
There's still time.

512
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,110
A great fire

513
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:46,350
burned all the evidence.

514
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:48,190
Looks like

515
00:24:48,710 --> 00:24:49,800
we can only start

516
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:50,760
with that granary officer.

517
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:52,430
Let's go.

518
00:25:13,310 --> 00:25:14,160
Miss Liu.

519
00:25:16,710 --> 00:25:18,310
Did you come to see me for something?

520
00:25:19,070 --> 00:25:20,040
I received a letter from Taiyuan.

521
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:21,880
It says Mr. Liu is unwell,

522
00:25:22,110 --> 00:25:23,110
hoping you'll return quickly.

523
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:26,830
My father has always been healthy.

524
00:25:27,430 --> 00:25:28,880
How is it that just a few days
after I leave,

525
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,350
he suddenly falls ill?

526
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:39,280
Filial piety is the highest virtue.

527
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:40,880
When parents are unwell,

528
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,110
we, as children,

529
00:25:42,230 --> 00:25:43,680
should serve them by their bedside.

530
00:25:46,230 --> 00:25:47,430
I'll go back tomorrow.

531
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:51,470
I've misunderstood you in the past.

532
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:52,760
These past few days,

533
00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:54,520
thanks to your guidance,

534
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:55,590
I've learned a lot.

535
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:57,880
Compared to you,

536
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:58,430
I feel

537
00:25:58,430 --> 00:25:59,760
selfish and weak.

538
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:01,560
It puts me to shame.

539
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:03,920
Muzhi, don't belittle yourself.

540
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:06,280
Life isn't a smooth path.

541
00:26:06,590 --> 00:26:07,950
Even if your heart is set on

542
00:26:07,950 --> 00:26:09,230
pure and noble goals,

543
00:26:09,230 --> 00:26:11,070
the road will be muddy
and full of obstacles.

544
00:26:11,470 --> 00:26:13,880
Especially since you're choosing a path

545
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:15,430
that others dare not take.

546
00:26:16,310 --> 00:26:17,950
I just regret being a woman,

547
00:26:18,230 --> 00:26:19,040
limited to offering

548
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:20,310
words of comfort,

549
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:21,350
but I can't

550
00:26:21,350 --> 00:26:22,710
walk this journey with you.

551
00:26:23,430 --> 00:26:26,110
Just stay true to yourself.

552
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,190
I understand everything.

553
00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:24,830
This is a sachet I made by hand.

554
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:27,560
I put in some medicinal herbs

555
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:29,430
to help calm the mind and aid sleep.

556
00:27:30,590 --> 00:27:33,190
Muzhi, you've been
under a lot of stress lately.

557
00:27:33,710 --> 00:27:34,680
You should give it a try.

558
00:27:36,430 --> 00:27:37,230
In that case,

559
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:42,430
thank you.

560
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:54,680
So...

561
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:57,760
Goodbye.

562
00:27:58,920 --> 00:27:59,830
Goodbye.

563
00:29:32,710 --> 00:29:34,400
Will Lian Shu be in danger?

564
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:38,800
Don't worry, he should be back soon.

565
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:45,680
It's Lian Shu.

566
00:29:47,230 --> 00:29:47,920
Young Master.

567
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:48,680
How's it going?

568
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:49,800
I've figured it out.

569
00:29:49,950 --> 00:29:51,110
Mr. Sun said

570
00:29:51,310 --> 00:29:52,110
that the granary officer

571
00:29:52,110 --> 00:29:53,310
has been dead for a while.

572
00:29:53,830 --> 00:29:54,710
Dead?

573
00:29:55,430 --> 00:29:56,230
How did he die?

574
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:57,920
In the fire that night,

575
00:29:58,280 --> 00:29:59,520
he was burned beyond recognition.

576
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,430
If the granary officer was a traitor,

577
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:04,470
how could he be burned to death

578
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:05,760
in the fire?

579
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,230
The granary was heavily guarded.

580
00:30:07,470 --> 00:30:08,160
He couldn't

581
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:09,640
have started that fire alone.

582
00:30:09,950 --> 00:30:11,520
He must have been betrayed
by accomplices.

583
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:14,310
Did you find out where he lived?

584
00:30:14,710 --> 00:30:16,160
At the Dixijiao hutong.

585
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:17,070
I'll take you there.

586
00:30:17,070 --> 00:30:18,040
You don't need to go.

587
00:30:18,830 --> 00:30:19,920
It's dangerous with too many people.

588
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:21,350
I'll go with Luo Shu.

589
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:28,640
It's dry and flammable;
watch out for fire.

590
00:30:30,590 --> 00:30:34,190
It's dry and flammable;
watch out for fire.

591
00:30:40,350 --> 00:30:43,950
It's dry and flammable;
watch out for fire.

592
00:31:23,470 --> 00:31:24,190
Look!

593
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:30,070
These are all brand new.

594
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:31,640
A granary officer's

595
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:33,070
salary for a year isn't even this much.

596
00:31:33,430 --> 00:31:35,350
The more money there is,
the greater the risk.

597
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,430
It cost him his life.

598
00:31:39,470 --> 00:31:40,070
This was

599
00:31:40,070 --> 00:31:41,230
just found in the cabinet.

600
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:43,230
Yu Chun, Ru Yan.

601
00:31:43,830 --> 00:31:45,430
They sound like names of two girls.

602
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:47,070
Wait.

603
00:31:48,070 --> 00:31:49,430
Yuchun should be Yuchun Music House,

604
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:51,190
the most famous entertainment venue
in Taiyuan.

605
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:53,920
So it's

606
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:55,280
the girl Ru Yan from Yuchun Music House.

607
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:58,710
Ru Yan.

608
00:31:59,830 --> 00:32:00,430
Could she be

609
00:32:00,430 --> 00:32:01,640
the granary officer's lover?

610
00:32:02,310 --> 00:32:03,470
Does she know anything?

611
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:08,880
Let's go!

612
00:32:18,070 --> 00:32:18,400
Don't move!

613
00:32:25,590 --> 00:32:26,710
It's you after all!

614
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,470
You conspired with Mr. Liu

615
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:31,760
to trap our Qi family.

616
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:33,520
How can you say it's a trap?

617
00:32:34,190 --> 00:32:35,070
I'm just making you Qi family

618
00:32:35,070 --> 00:32:36,520
pay for your sins.

619
00:32:37,430 --> 00:32:38,470
For so many years,

620
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:40,590
your Qi family has gone unpunished.

621
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:42,350
It's about time you paid the price.

622
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:43,470
And what about you?

623
00:32:44,190 --> 00:32:45,760
How do you plan to atone?

624
00:32:46,190 --> 00:32:47,560
Regarding my parents' deaths,

625
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,830
were you truly just an outsider?

626
00:32:51,190 --> 00:32:54,760
Does it even matter?

627
00:32:55,590 --> 00:32:56,350
In the end,

628
00:32:56,350 --> 00:32:57,470
isn't it because of the Qi family?

629
00:32:57,470 --> 00:32:58,160
Shut up!

630
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,110
You still think you're

631
00:33:04,110 --> 00:33:05,880
the high-and-mighty Mr. Qi,

632
00:33:06,110 --> 00:33:07,800
who can boss me around?

633
00:33:08,350 --> 00:33:09,520
Not just you,

634
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:11,560
but even your father, Qi Zongyue,

635
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:12,950
who once

636
00:33:13,430 --> 00:33:15,350
looked down

637
00:33:15,350 --> 00:33:16,190
on me,

638
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:18,560
is now a prisoner,

639
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:20,520
trembling like a homeless dog.

640
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:24,000
Talk about karma!

641
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:27,470
Don't get too cocky.

642
00:33:28,310 --> 00:33:29,800
Your turn will come.

643
00:33:31,830 --> 00:33:33,310
How could it come to me?

644
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,070
The outcome is already decided.

645
00:33:35,230 --> 00:33:36,310
The Qi family has lost.

646
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:38,190
And I

647
00:33:38,190 --> 00:33:39,880
still have power

648
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:41,430
in Taiyuan.

649
00:33:43,470 --> 00:33:44,160
Yulan,

650
00:33:44,830 --> 00:33:46,470
look at this person next to you.

651
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:47,710
He doesn't even know

652
00:33:47,710 --> 00:33:49,070
that his death is near.

653
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:50,760
You should marry me

654
00:33:51,110 --> 00:33:52,590
and return to the Qin mansion.

655
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:54,230
Aside from revenge,

656
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:55,710
I will never have

657
00:33:55,710 --> 00:33:57,430
any ties with you.

658
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:03,280
Who was it that knelt before me,

659
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:04,230
pleading with me?

660
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:05,880
If I remember correctly,

661
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:08,120
that person was Yulan.

662
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:10,520
How can you turn your back
on me like this?

663
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:12,600
You hate me so much,

664
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:14,600
but I always

665
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,560
keep you in my heart.

666
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:18,840
How about this:

667
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:21,040
If you agree to marry me,

668
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,840
I can let him go.

669
00:34:23,950 --> 00:34:24,760
In your dreams!

670
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:30,120
You dare to lay a hand on me?

671
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:31,800
You really overestimate yourself.

672
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:33,000
Taking you down now

673
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,470
is like squashing an ant.

674
00:34:39,630 --> 00:34:40,430
Stop it!

675
00:34:41,190 --> 00:34:42,560
I said stop!

676
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:46,840
Qin Yi!

677
00:34:50,190 --> 00:34:51,000
Stop!

678
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,080
Just a word from you

679
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,230
can save his life.

680
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,040
I'll ask you one more time:

681
00:35:04,390 --> 00:35:05,840
will you marry me?

682
00:35:06,670 --> 00:35:07,710
If he dies,

683
00:35:08,470 --> 00:35:10,280
I'll go with him to the other side.

684
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:12,710
Qin Yi!

685
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:14,390
Did you hear that?

686
00:35:14,910 --> 00:35:15,950
You scoundrel!

687
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:18,230
You won't get what you want in life.

688
00:35:21,230 --> 00:35:22,360
So stubborn!

689
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:23,840
Look at

690
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:24,630
your pathetic state now.

691
00:35:24,630 --> 00:35:25,870
You're worse than a dog.

692
00:35:26,910 --> 00:35:27,670
Alright.

693
00:35:27,670 --> 00:35:29,000
Just take a good look

694
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:30,080
and see

695
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:31,710
how she becomes my woman,

696
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:33,430
leaving you in agony.

697
00:35:33,670 --> 00:35:35,000
And she'll see

698
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:36,630
how you slowly fade away

699
00:35:36,630 --> 00:35:39,000
in front of her.

700
00:35:43,950 --> 00:35:44,800
Hit him!

701
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:20,280
Withdraw!

702
00:36:29,910 --> 00:36:31,760
Qi Yanjin, Qi Menglin,

703
00:36:32,150 --> 00:36:33,760
we are sworn enemies.

704
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:34,950
Qi Menglin,

705
00:36:35,390 --> 00:36:36,430
you worthless piece of trash,

706
00:36:36,710 --> 00:36:38,320
what gives you the right
to be with Yulan?

707
00:36:38,390 --> 00:36:39,230
What gives you the right?

708
00:36:39,670 --> 00:36:40,600
What gives you the right?

709
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:45,950
What gives you the right?

710
00:36:48,710 --> 00:36:49,670
Someone!

711
00:36:59,120 --> 00:36:59,910
Mr. Qin.

712
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:05,000
Bring them in!

713
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:06,910
Yes.

714
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:22,840
Mr. Qin, they're all here.

[Renowned for Noble Character and Elegance]

716
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,960
[Harmony and Grace Hall]

717
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:48,910
Father!

718
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:51,950
You're back.

719
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:55,870
You said in your letter
that you were unwell .

720
00:37:55,870 --> 00:37:56,840
Are you feeling better?

721
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:00,190
Much better.

722
00:38:01,670 --> 00:38:03,190
See? As soon as you arrived,

723
00:38:03,190 --> 00:38:05,760
I am recovering.

724
00:38:08,430 --> 00:38:09,230
That's good.

725
00:38:09,630 --> 00:38:11,280
It's worth it for me to rush back

726
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:12,840
after receiving your letter.

727
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:18,520
Wan,

728
00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:20,360
I have a question for you.

729
00:38:22,390 --> 00:38:24,360
Did you take

730
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:26,560
Han Muzhi's resignation letter?

731
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:27,360
Yes, I did.

732
00:38:28,670 --> 00:38:29,800
I returned it

733
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:30,800
to him.

734
00:38:31,670 --> 00:38:33,910
You've got some guts.

735
00:38:34,710 --> 00:38:35,910
You dared to take away

736
00:38:35,910 --> 00:38:36,870
such an important document.

737
00:38:37,630 --> 00:38:38,800
Looks like I've spoiled you too much

738
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:40,670
these past years.

739
00:38:41,390 --> 00:38:42,120
You showed me

740
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:43,390
Han Muzhi's resignation

741
00:38:44,190 --> 00:38:45,120
just to scold him

742
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:47,040
in front of me?

743
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
Han Muzhi is going to marry me.

744
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:52,600
Everyone knows this by now.

745
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:54,910
If he resigns now,

746
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:56,230
it's like breaking off the engagement.

747
00:38:57,230 --> 00:38:59,320
Can you handle

748
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:00,520
that kind of humiliation?

749
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:05,670
It's not bad that you have

750
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:09,120
such insight.

751
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:10,870
Very good.

752
00:39:11,470 --> 00:39:12,950
I know Han Muzhi well.

753
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:14,630
He's not the type to back down

754
00:39:14,630 --> 00:39:15,630
when faced with challenges.

755
00:39:16,950 --> 00:39:17,760
Look,

756
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:19,320
you're still

757
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:21,230
defending him.

758
00:39:22,390 --> 00:39:24,000
When you chose him,

759
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:24,760
I was wondering

760
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:26,520
if he was capable.

761
00:39:26,710 --> 00:39:28,150
Now, I think the same.

762
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:29,190
He's stubborn and unyielding.

763
00:39:32,470 --> 00:39:33,360
He's just

764
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:35,840
gone against your wishes.

765
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:36,950
That's right.

766
00:39:37,630 --> 00:39:38,430
He defied me.

767
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:42,360
Mr. Liu, Qin Yi has arrived.

768
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:43,120
Let him wait.

769
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:47,120
Father, you have important matters
to attend to.

770
00:39:47,870 --> 00:39:48,870
I should take my leave.

771
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:57,870
I'm Qin Yi.

772
00:39:57,910 --> 00:39:59,120
Nice to meet you, Miss Liu.

773
00:40:04,190 --> 00:40:05,280
Let him in.

774
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:06,190
Yes.

775
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:13,080
Please.

776
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:20,760
[Harmony and Grace Hall]

777
00:40:23,190 --> 00:40:24,320
Mr. Liu.

778
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:29,320
[Harmony and Grace Hall]

779
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:32,320
What do you need

780
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:33,840
to call me here?

781
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:38,000
Did you catch them?

782
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:41,390
I've set a trap

783
00:40:41,670 --> 00:40:43,870
and caught Qi Menglin.

784
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,280
But I didn't expect

785
00:40:46,470 --> 00:40:47,630
Qi Yanjin

786
00:40:47,950 --> 00:40:49,800
to show up

787
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:50,950
with a bunch of martial experts.

788
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:52,120
In the heat of the moment,

789
00:40:53,870 --> 00:40:55,430
they managed to get away.

790
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:00,520
I'm starting to wonder

791
00:41:02,230 --> 00:41:04,230
if I overestimated you.

792
00:41:06,190 --> 00:41:07,560
Don't worry, Mr. Liu.

793
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:10,840
They are just flailing around.

794
00:41:11,910 --> 00:41:13,470
I have many eyes and ears

795
00:41:13,470 --> 00:41:14,470
in Taiyuan.

796
00:41:14,630 --> 00:41:16,520
I'll get them soon.

797
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:22,040
I hope you're not just talking big

798
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:24,120
to fool me.

799
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:25,120
I wouldn't dare.

800
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:27,470
Qin Yi,

801
00:41:29,390 --> 00:41:30,390
you should know

802
00:41:30,870 --> 00:41:32,560
that in my governor yamen,

803
00:41:32,950 --> 00:41:34,760
there are many soldiers

804
00:41:36,150 --> 00:41:38,430
eager to prove themselves.

805
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:46,560
I understand.

806
00:42:01,710 --> 00:42:02,520
We've arrived.

807
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:05,870
Take it slow.

808
00:42:11,670 --> 00:42:13,670
We're here; follow me.

809
00:42:31,470 --> 00:42:32,710
Where are we?

810
00:42:36,670 --> 00:42:37,470
Tianlong Mountain.

811
00:42:38,190 --> 00:42:40,000
Others only know
I practice alchemy and Taoism,

812
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:41,950
but they have no idea
that I also cultivate Buddhism.

813
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:45,600
It's very safe here.

814
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:46,870
In a bit,

815
00:42:46,870 --> 00:42:47,910
you can rest

816
00:42:47,910 --> 00:42:48,840
in this room.

817
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:52,080
