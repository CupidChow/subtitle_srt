"Jin Nang" by Shui He]

[Episode 19]

4
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:34,510
Lv Wanchang's family

5
00:01:34,510 --> 00:01:35,830
may not meet with them directly.

6
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:37,080
There must be someone else

7
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:38,630
setting them up.

8
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:41,550
Song might be the one behind in Hejin.

9
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:44,360
There must be a mole in Linfen Yamen.

10
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:45,590
Wait.

11
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:47,760
How could he have a connection

12
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:49,120
with the petty official in Linfen?

13
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:50,680
Mr. Yang

14
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,080
is Mr. Cai's junior.

15
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:53,760
I'm afraid that's a common thing.

16
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:56,190
Hejin and Linfen are
in the same province.

17
00:01:56,230 --> 00:01:57,190
We officials

18
00:01:57,190 --> 00:01:58,190
are all locals here,

19
00:01:58,190 --> 00:01:59,950
so many of us
are related somehow or other.

20
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:01,870
Alright,

21
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:02,630
let's arrest Song first.

22
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:03,800
Then we'll know about the other one.

23
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:04,760
No way.

24
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:05,800
Why?

25
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,080
You don't have any evidence.

26
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:08,110
Even if you

27
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:09,960
tell Hejin's magistrate the truth,

28
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:11,670
he won't believe you.

29
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:14,830
We can only look for loopholes

30
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:16,720
from those two kidnappers.

31
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:19,030
Do you have any ideas?

32
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,320
I do have one,

33
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:22,470
but...

34
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,190
Miss Luo,

35
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:27,440
why are you being so hesitant?

36
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,030
Come on, tell us.

37
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:29,960
Yeah.

38
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,190
Maybe we can help.

39
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:31,910
Right.

40
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:35,390
Think about it.

41
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:37,270
Jin Liu

42
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:38,390
could risk his own life

43
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:39,240
to get money

44
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,440
for his wife.

45
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:41,600
It means that

46
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,320
he really loved his wife, right?

47
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,110
Yes.

48
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,030
But today,

49
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:47,910
from Mrs. Jin's behavior,

50
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:49,830
she is very unkind to Jin Liu.

51
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:50,880
If we could

52
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,240
take action against her,

53
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,520
it would surely provoke Jin Liu

54
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,600
to reveal the truth.

55
00:02:55,670 --> 00:02:56,600
How to take action?

56
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:00,520
Are you gonna ask someone

57
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,320
to disguise as a rich man

58
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,470
to seduce Mrs. Jin?

59
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,720
That's a good idea.

60
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:07,750
But

61
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:09,830
who's gonna do it?

62
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,720
Don't look at me.

63
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:22,360
I can't do it.

64
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:22,960
I absolutely can't.

65
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:23,750
I don't even like her!

66
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:25,320
We didn't say you have to like her.

67
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,390
You can do it.

68
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,360
Just play with her.

69
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,600
What do you mean by that?

70
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:29,800
No, no.

71
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:31,190
You want me to seduce

72
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:31,750
another woman?

73
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:32,670
You...

74
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:35,470
You...

75
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:43,960
If you really

76
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,190
don't want to do it,

77
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:46,750
we won't force you.

78
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:48,830
We'll think of another way.

79
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,720
How do I look, Miss Luo?

80
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,190
I'm better than him, right?

81
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:14,520
Where?

82
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:16,320
Look at your big round face.

83
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,040
My big...

84
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,160
Who are you calling big round face?

85
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,350
Do you look in the mirror?

86
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:20,790
Your face looks like a basin,

87
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:21,880
and you call me big round face?

88
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,160
Look at yourself.

89
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:23,790
You big round face.

90
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:24,160
You big face.

91
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:24,720
Big round face.

92
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:25,440
You basin face.

93
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,070
Big round face.

94
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:27,670
Alright, stop it.

95
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:30,950
I know you're trying to help,

96
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,880
but you can't do this.

97
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,390
Why?

98
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:35,390
Your quality is just not right.

99
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:37,200
Not scaring her away

100
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,390
is already good enough.

101
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:40,600
It's even hard for you to succeed.

102
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:43,550
Go away.

103
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,110
If we can't find a suitable person,

104
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,230
I'll be the one

105
00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:52,720
who is disguised as the rich man.

106
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:54,480
What?

107
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,160
I'll go.

108
00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:57,390
Mr. Qi.

109
00:04:58,880 --> 00:04:59,390
Seriously?

110
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:00,230
Yes.

111
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,480
Mr. QI, you really
should have said earlier.

112
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:02,950
We wouldn't have had

113
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:04,270
to force ourselves to dress up.

114
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:05,880
If you do this,

115
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,270
you'll definitely succeed.

116
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:08,790
Let me make it clear...

117
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:09,880
Stop it.

118
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:11,200
I'm not doing this

119
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,390
for Linfen Yamen.

120
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:14,200
I just don't want Luo Shu...

121
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:17,600
Don't want to see you in a tight spot.

122
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:19,880
Alright.

123
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:20,920
I owe you

124
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,070
a big favor.

125
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:23,790
I'll go prepare for you.

126
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:24,600
Good.

127
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,230
Let me help you.

128
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,230
Don't touch me.

129
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:44,350
I was passing through here

130
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:45,790
and I seem to have lost my way.

131
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:47,160
May I

132
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,670
ask for a bowl of water, my lady?

133
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,440
Just a bowl of water,

134
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:53,510
sure.

135
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,110
Please come in.

136
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,830
Are you getting a cold?

137
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:12,000
Then you shouldn't drink cold water.

138
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:14,000
Please come inside,

139
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:17,830
and rest for a while.

140
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,480
I'll go make ginger decoction.

141
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:24,670
Thank you, my lady.

142
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,270
I can do it.

143
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,880
I can do it.

144
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:58,830
Here you are.

145
00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:00,440
It's hot. Take your time.

146
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:12,440
May I know your name?

147
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:14,790
My surname is Meng,

148
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,200
Meng Lin.

149
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:17,230
Mr. Meng.

150
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,350
Please sit down.

151
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:24,440
This ginger decoction

152
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:25,880
is really warming and refreshing.

153
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:31,350
It's been cold these days.

154
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,400
Why are you going hunting?

155
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,230
I was supposed to

156
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:37,280
hunt deer with my friends,

157
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:38,790
but we got separated.

158
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,110
I was stuck
in the mountains overnight.

159
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:41,110
I just came down.

160
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,150
Fortunately, I met you.

161
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:49,080
Do you live alone?

162
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:52,550
Yes.

163
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:55,640
I've been living alone for years,

164
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,350
all by myself.

165
00:08:59,150 --> 00:09:00,030
So is your husband

166
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:01,400
doing business outside?

167
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,030
If he's really

168
00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:05,550
a businessman,

169
00:09:05,710 --> 00:09:06,590
I must be so fortunate

170
00:09:06,590 --> 00:09:07,670
in my lifetime.

171
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,320
I'm telling you.

172
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:15,760
Don't be scared.

173
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:17,470
My husband is a

174
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:18,640
bandit who kills and robs.

175
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,000
What?

176
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,550
He's in jail now,

177
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:21,670
and will be executed after the autumn.

178
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:22,200
What?

179
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,280
You're so beautiful.

180
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,080
How could you marry such a villain?

181
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:28,400
He didn't marry me

182
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,840
with a formal wedding.

183
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:34,760
He is a villain.

184
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:37,520
He raped me
and forced me to be his wife.

185
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:42,280
I'm just a broken woman

186
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:44,840
with nowhere else to go.

187
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:46,670
I...

188
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,710
I'm so miserable.

189
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,710
Please don't cry.

190
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:52,790
My lady,

191
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:54,760
you're still young

192
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:57,230
and beautiful as Xi Shi and Diao Chan.
[*Two of the Four Ancient Beauties]

193
00:09:57,550 --> 00:09:58,470
You'll meet someone

194
00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:00,110
who loves you wholeheartedly.

195
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,400
You'll have a good life in the future.

196
00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:06,030
Mr. Meng, don't joke with me.

197
00:10:06,590 --> 00:10:08,030
I'm serious.

198
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:12,350
If what you said comes true,

199
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:15,320
it will be my good fortune.

200
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,000
I've been here for a while.

201
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:20,350
If I stay any longer,

202
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:22,000
it might be inconvenient for you.

203
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:23,670
I'll take my leave.

204
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:25,640
This silver ingot
is a token of my gratitude.

205
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:26,790
Thank you, my lady.

206
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:29,150
What are you doing?

207
00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:30,840
It's just a bowl of ginger decoction.

208
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:33,150
You don't need to do this.

209
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,080
It's a repayment

210
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,280
for your kindness.

211
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:40,230
A thousand gold coins
in return for a meal.

212
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:42,520
I'm just following the ancients.

213
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:46,840
If it's difficult for you to accept,

214
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,080
how about taking it

215
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:49,960
and treating me tonight?

216
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:53,880
Alright,

217
00:10:54,590 --> 00:10:56,910
if you say so,

218
00:10:57,550 --> 00:10:58,470
I'll prepare a fine dinner

219
00:10:58,470 --> 00:11:00,470
with good liquor and delicious dishes.

220
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:03,030
You

221
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,280
come tonight.

222
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:08,030
Alright,

223
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:11,000
I'll come back tonight

224
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,110
to ask for another bowl of water.

225
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:13,440
By then,

226
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,760
you don't regret it.

227
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:34,200
You look prettier than a girl
when you dress up like this.

228
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:36,080
Is that a compliment?

229
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:37,440
You're as handsome as Pan An,
[*One of the Four Most Handsome Men]

230
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,550
tall, elegant, and charming.

231
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:40,400
How about that?

232
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:42,550
That's better.

233
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:45,350
Help me out.

234
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:48,910
Which one?

235
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:52,350
This one.

236
00:12:01,710 --> 00:12:02,520
Look at me,

237
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,760
with this outfit,

238
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,000
how can Mrs. Jin

239
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,350
refuse me?

240
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,080
A man and a woman

241
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,760
in the room at night.

242
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:12,470
After drinking some liquor,

243
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,710
there might be...

244
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,280
You're just playing with her.

245
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,670
Don't go too far.

246
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:26,440
Don't worry.

247
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:27,960
I promise.

248
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:29,350
Nothing will happen.

249
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:33,670
What's that mean?

250
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:34,470
You gave Mrs. Jin

251
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:35,880
two liang before.

252
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:36,640
It's on me.

253
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,200
But it's more than two liang.

254
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,910
This hairpin is also on me.

255
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:42,230
When you go to see Mrs. Jin,

256
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:43,110
give it to her as a gift.

257
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:47,230
It's not a big deal.

258
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:49,440
Take it.

259
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,080
You shouldn't pay for this.

260
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:52,880
Why?

261
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:55,110
You got public money from the yamen?

262
00:12:55,670 --> 00:12:56,760
No,

263
00:12:57,590 --> 00:12:58,640
it's my own money.

264
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:02,790
So, you spend your own money

265
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:03,840
to help Han Muzhi with the case,

266
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:05,440
but you don't want my money to help you.

267
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:08,710
Han Muzhi was

268
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:09,590
so ruthless to you.

269
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:11,230
Don't tell me you still
have feelings for him.

270
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,790
I owe him.

271
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:17,030
I want to help him

272
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:18,350
solve this last case.

273
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:22,030
Then we'll be even.

274
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:23,080
I support you.

275
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,110
Pay him back as soon as possible.

276
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:26,230
But you can

277
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:28,710
continue to owe me.

278
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,080
This one is also pretty good.

279
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:51,470
Mr. Meng, here you are.

280
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:29,550
Thank you, my lady.

281
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:32,350
You heart thief.

282
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:33,470
Why are you still being polite

283
00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:34,880
at this time?

284
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,030
You can call me

285
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:40,880
Yuzhen.

286
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:45,280
Yuzhen.

287
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,400
I can tell from your accent

288
00:15:05,710 --> 00:15:07,030
that you're not local, right?

289
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:09,670
I've lived in Taiyuan

290
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:11,080
for quite some time.

291
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:12,400
Taiyuan.

292
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,280
That's a great place.

293
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:17,670
Mr. Meng.

294
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:31,230
Yuzhen,

295
00:15:32,710 --> 00:15:33,790
to be honest,

296
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:35,960
I've traveled all over the place
these years,

297
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:37,440
and seen plenty of beautiful women,

298
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,110
but I've never seen one

299
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:40,590
as endearing as you.

300
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:45,200
Really?

301
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,200
Of course.

302
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:51,640
It's really unfair.

303
00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:52,910
You shouldn't

304
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:54,320
be with such a brute

305
00:15:55,150 --> 00:15:56,000
who shoved you into

306
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:56,760
such a miserable life,

307
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:57,670
making you suffer.

308
00:15:58,520 --> 00:15:59,760
A beauty like you

309
00:16:01,590 --> 00:16:03,000
should have met me earlier.

310
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:04,790
Lin.

311
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:10,670
Yuzhen.

312
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:12,550
Now that we've met,

313
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:14,440
and here we are.

314
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:18,000
It's not too late for anything.

315
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:20,880
Let's have a drink.

316
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,320
Have a drink.

317
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:24,350
Cheers.

318
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,440
What a waste.

319
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:40,670
Lin,

320
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:43,550
don't you like me?

321
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:47,030
I like you of course.

322
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:50,960
No, no.

323
00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:54,350
Lin,

324
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:56,320
you're clearly rejecting me.

325
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,030
I'm not.

326
00:16:58,550 --> 00:16:59,400
Yuzhen,

327
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:00,670
get up.

328
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:01,760
Come on.

329
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,710
Are you hurt?

330
00:17:06,430 --> 00:17:07,680
Stand up.

331
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:09,230
Yuzhen.

332
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:11,000
I'm gonna take you back to Taiyuan.

333
00:17:12,590 --> 00:17:13,830
Once we're settled,

334
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:15,350
we can be intimate, alright?

335
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:18,350
You really want to take me
back to Taiyuan?

336
00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:20,520
Once that person dies,

337
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:21,520
we'll set off immediately.

338
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:22,680
We'll be a pair

339
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:23,920
of long-lasting spouses.

340
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:28,560
We have plenty of time ahead,

341
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:29,950
So tonight,

342
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,280
let's just drink.

343
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:34,760
Just drink.

344
00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:38,190
Come on.

345
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:45,760
Eat the head of cabbage for vegetables.

347

348
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:07,920
I wear silk,
while my husband wear brocade.

349
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:21,000
Lin, you're awake.

350
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:22,160
Yes.

351
00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:28,000
I'll go fetch water

352
00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:29,710
to help you wash up.

353
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,800
Lin, be careful on the road.

354
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:41,710
Don't alarm the neighbors.

355
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:54,520
Lin.

356
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,710
Don't forget to do something

357
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:12,710
to let the neighbors see.

358
00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:13,880
That hairpin,

359
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,590
better to give it in front of others.

360
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:48,400
Lin.

361
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,040
Yuzhen.

362
00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:50,350
Why are you back?

363
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:54,310
This is for you.

364
00:20:57,190 --> 00:20:58,000
Let me help you.

365
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:07,110
You look so beautiful.

366
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:11,190
I'm off.

367
00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:35,800
How did it go?

368
00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:40,000
You...

369
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,470
You just think about my task.

370
00:21:42,470 --> 00:21:44,470
You don't care about me.

371
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:45,680
But you're back,

372
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:46,800
aren't you?

373
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:47,680
Yes,

374
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:48,470
but I'm feeling bad.

375
00:21:49,310 --> 00:21:49,950
Why?

376
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:51,310
She hasn't bitten on your charm?

377
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:52,680
No.

378
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:53,640
She's been

379
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:54,640
hooked on my bait.

380
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:55,400
That's why I'm upset.

381
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:56,920
I am

382
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,280
such a man of integrity.

383
00:21:58,280 --> 00:21:59,070
Now I'm being

384
00:21:59,070 --> 00:21:59,880
hugged by her.

385
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:02,470
Don't you...

386
00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:05,000
Don't you mind?

387
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:06,710
I do.

388
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:08,230
You really do?

389
00:22:09,350 --> 00:22:11,230
Oh, no.

390
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:12,640
You must think I'm dirty now.

391
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:14,640
And you'll look down on me.

392
00:22:15,950 --> 00:22:17,110
Alright.

393
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:18,710
What are you thinking?

394
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:19,640
You know

395
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:20,880
my background,

396
00:22:21,230 --> 00:22:22,800
but you never look down on me,

397
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,430
and you consider me a friend, right?

398
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:26,880
I know your character.

399
00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:28,000
I know

400
00:22:28,190 --> 00:22:29,920
you're not someone
who's easily captivated by beauty.

401
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,000
I know it's difficult for you.

402
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:33,830
I really appreciate it.

403
00:22:33,830 --> 00:22:35,190
How could I look down on you?

404
00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:36,160
Really?

405
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:36,950
Really.

406
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:40,640
Alright.

407
00:22:41,950 --> 00:22:43,590
With your words,

408
00:22:44,310 --> 00:22:45,520
I'll do it again.

409
00:22:47,110 --> 00:22:48,310
Again?

410
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,590
You feel good about it?

411
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:53,160
No, I don't.

412
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:54,430
That's not what I meant.

413
00:22:54,430 --> 00:22:55,710
I get it.

414
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:56,800
What?

415
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,040
You've finished your task.

416
00:22:58,230 --> 00:22:59,710
The hairpin on your head

417
00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:00,710
was given to her.

418
00:23:00,710 --> 00:23:02,070
So you succeeded.

419
00:23:02,310 --> 00:23:04,280
Leave the rest to me.

420
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:11,350
Slow down.

421
00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:13,590
Be careful.

422
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:22,680
Excuse me, is this Zheng's house?

423
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,190
Who are you?

424
00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:32,400
Are you Zheng San's wife?

425
00:23:33,590 --> 00:23:34,640
Who are you?

426
00:23:34,950 --> 00:23:36,310
I'm from Linfen,

427
00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:37,680
Ma Tianjin's family.

428
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,430
My husband is in jail now.

429
00:23:42,710 --> 00:23:43,880
He'll be executed after the autumn.

430
00:23:44,430 --> 00:23:45,280
If you seek revenge,

431
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:46,190
go find him.

432
00:23:46,830 --> 00:23:48,160
I'm just a widow with my children,

433
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:49,920
trying to live peacefully.

434
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:51,920
Don't worry.

435
00:23:52,190 --> 00:23:53,350
I'm not here for revenge.

436
00:24:02,950 --> 00:24:04,710
Here, this is for you.

437
00:24:05,230 --> 00:24:06,040
Thank you.

438
00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:08,110
Take it.

439
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:14,710
Give it back.

440
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,040
It's alright.

441
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:17,470
They're in a stage

442
00:24:17,470 --> 00:24:18,880
of physical growth.

443
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,110
They should eat more meat.

444
00:24:20,310 --> 00:24:21,110
Thank you.

445
00:24:21,190 --> 00:24:21,880
Thank you.

446
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:22,430
Wait.

447
00:24:29,710 --> 00:24:30,470
I know

448
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:32,760
your husband didn't kill Ma Tianjin.

449
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:38,400
What are you talking about?

450
00:24:40,310 --> 00:24:41,470
Just like Jin Liu,

451
00:24:41,470 --> 00:24:43,110
he's framed and bought by someone.

452
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,710
I'm sure you know that too,

453
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:45,640
right?

454
00:24:47,830 --> 00:24:49,640
I just want justice.

455
00:24:54,190 --> 00:24:55,000
Mrs. Zheng,

456
00:24:55,950 --> 00:24:57,070
put yourself in my shoes.

457
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:58,800
If you were me,

458
00:24:59,110 --> 00:25:00,110
would you stand by

459
00:25:00,110 --> 00:25:01,110
and watch your family

460
00:25:01,110 --> 00:25:02,310
die without a clear cause

461
00:25:02,310 --> 00:25:03,920
while the murderer goes scott-free?

462
00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:12,800
I'm really sorry for your loss,

463
00:25:13,230 --> 00:25:14,470
but what's the use of

464
00:25:14,470 --> 00:25:15,430
asking these questions?

465
00:25:18,710 --> 00:25:20,350
How much silver did they offer you?

466
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:23,520
You raise two children on your own.

467
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:25,160
You have a long way to go.

468
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,350
Those money won't last you long.

469
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:31,640
If you help me

470
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:32,800
get them retract testimony

471
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,350
and find the murderer,

472
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:35,880
no matter how much they offer,

473
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:37,230
I'll double it.

474
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:52,430
You're not like Mrs. Jin

475
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,800
who's alone with no children.

476
00:25:55,070 --> 00:25:56,190
Once her husband is dead,

477
00:25:56,430 --> 00:25:57,710
she will take the money

478
00:25:57,710 --> 00:25:58,920
and live happily.

479
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:01,760
I heard

480
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:03,520
she's hooked up

481
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,800
with a rich young man recently.

482
00:26:06,710 --> 00:26:07,760
But you,

483
00:26:08,350 --> 00:26:10,280
with the same money for three people,

484
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:11,920
you have to

485
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:13,230
think about your future.

486
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:15,280
As the old saying goes,

487
00:26:15,430 --> 00:26:17,470
it's every man for himself.

488
00:26:17,950 --> 00:26:18,590
You can't

489
00:26:18,590 --> 00:26:20,280
just let her live comfortably

490
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,400
while you endure hardships, can you?

491
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:25,470
Why don't you go to talk to her?

492
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:29,920
To be honest,

493
00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:32,040
I went to see her,

494
00:26:33,110 --> 00:26:35,520
but she wouldn't help.

495
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:39,680
Even with the double money?

496
00:26:40,950 --> 00:26:42,800
She's eager for her husband
to die early,

497
00:26:43,110 --> 00:26:44,590
so she can live happily

498
00:26:44,590 --> 00:26:45,880
with that rich young man.

499
00:26:46,190 --> 00:26:47,310
For her,

500
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:49,110
if she marries that young man,

501
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:51,160
she'll have endless wealth.

502
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:53,070
Even triple the money

503
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:54,950
won't change her mind.

504
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:56,950
Mrs. Zheng,

505
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:58,830
even if you don't think about yourself,

506
00:27:00,110 --> 00:27:01,280
you really should

507
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:02,280
think about your children.

508
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:21,160
I'll come again

509
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:23,760
in a few days.

510
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:40,540
[Jail]

511
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:43,680
Mrs. Zheng, you're here too.

512
00:28:05,190 --> 00:28:05,920
You've come.

513
00:28:06,070 --> 00:28:06,760
Yes.

514
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:14,590
Why did you bring such a good meal?

515
00:28:15,350 --> 00:28:17,000
I'm dying soon.

516
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:19,000
Leave them for the kids.

517
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:20,590
Don't worry about that.

518
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:21,640
Eat up.

519
00:28:23,190 --> 00:28:23,800
Here.

520
00:28:24,310 --> 00:28:25,230
I'm so envious.

521
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:28,680
Liu.

522
00:28:28,830 --> 00:28:29,950
Come join us.

523
00:28:30,310 --> 00:28:31,110
Come here.

524
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:35,470
Thank you.

525
00:28:40,430 --> 00:28:42,040
That's your meal?

526
00:28:43,350 --> 00:28:44,680
My lazy wife

527
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:45,880
just sent me steamed buns.

528
00:28:46,190 --> 00:28:47,880
Yuzhen is really something.

529
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:50,350
How can she only consider the new
and not the old?

530
00:28:53,470 --> 00:28:55,400
What do you mean?

531
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:59,110
Nothing.

532
00:28:59,110 --> 00:29:00,430
Eat some more.

533
00:29:00,950 --> 00:29:03,040
Mrs. Zheng, what's going on?

534
00:29:11,430 --> 00:29:12,230
Liu.

535
00:29:12,470 --> 00:29:13,350
There's something

536
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:15,470
I don't know if I should say.

537
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:16,470
But I feel

538
00:29:16,470 --> 00:29:17,520
so unfair for you.

539
00:29:18,430 --> 00:29:19,640
Yuzhen

540
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:21,350
hooked up with a rich young man.

541
00:29:21,350 --> 00:29:23,000
What are you talking about?

542
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,070
That's true.

543
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:25,880
That young man gave Yuzhen

544
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:27,000
lots of jewelry.

545
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:27,800
You saw she wore

546
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:29,190
a gem-encrusted gold hairpin today.

547
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:31,000
Alright, stop it.

548
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:34,950
Let's eat.

549
00:29:37,470 --> 00:29:38,280
Jin Liu,

550
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:39,710
your wife is here.

551
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:43,430
You've come.

552
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:50,710
Here you are.

553
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:55,800
Just two steamed buns?

554
00:29:55,950 --> 00:29:57,040
We don't have vegetables at home.

555
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:06,310
Yes.

556
00:30:07,070 --> 00:30:08,760
I've done what you asked.

557
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:11,070
Don't forget your promise.

558
00:30:12,430 --> 00:30:14,040
They offered me thirty liang.

559
00:30:14,430 --> 00:30:15,710
So you need to give me sixty liang.

560
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:17,920
I want silver ingots.

561
00:30:23,710 --> 00:30:25,880
Here's a hundred liang.

562
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:52,430
You're right.

563
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:57,590
It's every man for himself.

564
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:15,680
Did you give her?

565
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:20,710
To repay Han Muzhi's favor,

566
00:31:20,710 --> 00:31:22,110
you really spent a lot.

567
00:31:23,230 --> 00:31:24,800
Stirring up trouble

568
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,160
is not what I want.

569
00:31:26,710 --> 00:31:28,070
This one hundred liang

570
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:30,070
may bring me peace of mind.

571
00:31:30,950 --> 00:31:32,470
Bring you peace of mind.

572
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:34,830
You spent one hundred liang

573
00:31:34,830 --> 00:31:35,470
for that.

574
00:31:35,470 --> 00:31:36,800
That's expensive.

575
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:38,430
May I ask you

576
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:39,310
where you got

577
00:31:39,310 --> 00:31:40,280
so much money?

578
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:42,800
I can't tell you that.

579
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,470
You really keep a low profile.

580
00:31:46,590 --> 00:31:47,350
How many things

581
00:31:47,350 --> 00:31:48,400
don't I know about you?

582
00:31:49,430 --> 00:31:51,400
Too many.

583
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:14,830
San, I'm sorry.

584
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:16,350
I'll retract testimony.

585
00:32:16,830 --> 00:32:19,280
Listen to me.

586
00:32:19,430 --> 00:32:20,230
It might not be

587
00:32:20,230 --> 00:32:22,160
what you think.

588
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:23,950
Wait for your wife to come next time
and ask her.

589
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:25,430
Make a decision after that.

590
00:32:25,430 --> 00:32:26,560
No need for that.

591
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:28,350
Your wife is honest and straightforward.

592
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:30,070
If she said it, it must be true.

593
00:32:32,110 --> 00:32:32,920
No.

594
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:35,350
I risked my life to get the money.

595
00:32:35,710 --> 00:32:37,110
She can't share it with a young man.

596
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:38,680
I'll retract testimony.

597
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,280
Liu.

598
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:41,230
I want to retract testimony.

599
00:32:41,230 --> 00:32:43,230
Is there anyone? I'll retract testimony.

600
00:32:43,470 --> 00:32:46,230
Where's the magistrate?
I'll retract testimony.

601
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:47,680
I'll retract testimony.

602
00:32:49,710 --> 00:32:50,680
Shut up.

603
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:52,470
Are you crazy?

604
00:32:52,710 --> 00:32:53,520
I'm not.

605
00:32:54,110 --> 00:32:54,920
I'm gonna retract testimony.

606
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:55,920
Keep your voice down.

607
00:32:56,350 --> 00:32:57,920
Did you get kicked in the head?

608
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:59,830
What am I gonna do if you retract?

609
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:01,800
San, don't worry.

610
00:33:02,110 --> 00:33:03,190
I'll just retract my part.

611
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:04,470
You can still take the money.

612
00:33:05,230 --> 00:33:07,560
Stop watching. Go to bed.

613
00:33:08,230 --> 00:33:09,040
Sit.

614
00:33:12,310 --> 00:33:14,280
What is wrong with you?

615
00:33:15,230 --> 00:33:16,590
You confessed together.

616
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:18,310
Do you really think

617
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:20,430
you can retract your part?

618
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:27,040
I don't care. I'm gonna retract my part.

619
00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:31,040
San, I'm sorry.

620
00:33:32,950 --> 00:33:34,950
I just can't let it go.

621
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:38,470
In my next life, I'll be your slave

622
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:39,310
to repay you.

623
00:33:41,590 --> 00:33:42,560
I'll retract testimony.

624
00:33:43,190 --> 00:33:44,400
I want to talk to the magistrate.

625
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:46,000
If you don't let me see him,

626
00:33:46,470 --> 00:33:47,430
I'll shout here.

627
00:33:47,430 --> 00:33:48,350
I'll shout loud enough for everyone.

628
00:33:48,350 --> 00:33:49,310
Shut up.

629
00:33:49,310 --> 00:33:50,000
I'll retract testimony.

630
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:50,640
Shut up.

631
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:51,400
I'll retract testimony.

632
00:33:56,470 --> 00:33:57,280
Alright.

633
00:34:00,070 --> 00:34:01,160
Do you think shouting like that

634
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:03,190
will bring the magistrate here?

635
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:04,760
Fine.

636
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,110
I'll go to invite him.

637
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:08,910
You wait here.

638
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:15,710
Shut your mouth.

639
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:30,360
Go to bed.

640
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:38,320
How is it?

641
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:38,870
He bit.

642
00:35:01,950 --> 00:35:04,600
Jin Liu.

643
00:35:07,190 --> 00:35:08,000
Get up.

644
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:11,040
The magistrate wants to interrogate you.

645
00:35:14,670 --> 00:35:15,760
Be quiet.

646
00:35:17,390 --> 00:35:18,190
Go.

647
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,910
San, I'm sorry.

648
00:35:24,910 --> 00:35:25,670
Go.

649
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:38,150
That way.

650
00:35:53,430 --> 00:35:54,560
Why is the magistrate

651
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,950
interrogating me
in the middle of the night?

652
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:58,470
Doesn't he sleep?

653
00:35:58,470 --> 00:35:59,950
You talk too much.

654
00:36:00,190 --> 00:36:01,000
Just go.

655
00:36:24,430 --> 00:36:26,000
Where is this place?

656
00:36:26,630 --> 00:36:28,230
Why isn't here even a light?

657
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:40,760
There's no need for lights
on the way to your afterlife.

658
00:36:50,390 --> 00:36:51,120
Song.

659
00:36:51,470 --> 00:36:52,560
It's really you.

660
00:36:54,470 --> 00:36:56,080
You tried to kill me?

661
00:36:56,430 --> 00:36:57,470
Even if I die,

662
00:36:57,870 --> 00:36:59,710
I'll drag you down with me.

663
00:37:06,150 --> 00:37:06,950
Your Honor,

664
00:37:07,430 --> 00:37:08,840
I didn't kill Ma Tianjin.

665
00:37:09,390 --> 00:37:10,560
I commit murder and robbery.

666
00:37:11,150 --> 00:37:12,230
I know I'll lead to a bad end.

667
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:14,910
So I just wanted to
use my worthless life

668
00:37:14,910 --> 00:37:15,560
to get some money

669
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:16,710
for my wife.

670
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:20,710
But I never expected her

671
00:37:21,390 --> 00:37:23,080
to hook up with a young man
before my death.

672
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:28,320
Who bought you to take the blame?

673
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,760
It was him.

674
00:37:31,430 --> 00:37:32,470
He coerced and threatened me.

675
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:35,120
I was blinded by greed

676
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,430
so I agreed to him.

677
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:37,950
San can testify for me.

678
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:40,630
Song.

679
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,520
You took bribes and violated the law,

680
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:45,230
and then attempted murder.

681
00:37:45,870 --> 00:37:47,430
If you're convicted,

682
00:37:48,710 --> 00:37:50,710
you'll be sentenced to death.

683
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:53,040
Your Honor, please spare my life.

684
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,600
Please spare my life.

685
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:56,630
I know you're not the head.

686
00:37:57,230 --> 00:37:58,710
There must be someone behind you,

687
00:37:58,710 --> 00:37:59,470
right?

688
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:02,760
The head will definitely
be severely punished,

689
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:04,760
but the accomplice may not.

690
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:06,390
So,

691
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:08,840
your life is in your own hands.

692
00:38:09,430 --> 00:38:11,430
Do you wanna be
the head or the accomplice?

693
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:13,520
It's up to you.

694
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,390
Song, at this point,

695
00:38:16,390 --> 00:38:17,630
what are you hesitating about?

696
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:19,560
Do you want your life or money?

697
00:38:19,950 --> 00:38:20,760
I...

698
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:22,710
Just tell the truth.

699
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:24,710
I... I confess.

700
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:26,520
It was an old man.

701
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:28,120
Last month,

702
00:38:28,470 --> 00:38:30,080
he asked me to do this.

703
00:38:30,390 --> 00:38:31,150
The testimony.

704
00:38:31,150 --> 00:38:32,840
He taught me about the testimony.

705
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:34,360
What's his name?

706
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:36,800
I don't know.

707
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:45,320
Don't play games.

708
00:38:46,430 --> 00:38:47,280
I...

709
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:50,280
I really don't know.

710
00:38:50,950 --> 00:38:51,950
All I know is that

711
00:38:52,470 --> 00:38:54,800
my teacher introduced him

712
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:56,670
as his good friend.

713
00:38:56,950 --> 00:38:58,710
He didn't want to be identified.

714
00:38:58,870 --> 00:39:00,280
So I didn't dare to ask.

715
00:39:02,430 --> 00:39:03,390
Who is your teacher?

716
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:06,800
Is he from our Linfen Yamen?

717
00:39:08,150 --> 00:39:08,950
Even if you don't say,

718
00:39:08,950 --> 00:39:10,080
we'll find out eventually.

719
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,630
We'll just take a bit more time.

720
00:39:12,230 --> 00:39:13,190
By then,

721
00:39:13,190 --> 00:39:14,360
you'll lose the chance

722
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:15,320
to get a lenient sentence.

723
00:39:15,430 --> 00:39:15,910
It's...

724
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:22,080
It's Mr. Wei from Linfen Yamen.

725
00:39:24,630 --> 00:39:25,360
Mr. Wei

726
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:26,760
has worked at the yamen for many years.

727
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,870
You don't know that old man's name.

728
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:32,600
You should remember his appearance.

729
00:39:33,950 --> 00:39:36,760
He has silver hair and a long beard.

730
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:40,080
He looks shrewd.

731
00:39:40,230 --> 00:39:41,280
Any other features?

732
00:39:41,390 --> 00:39:45,390
No, I don't think so.

733
00:39:50,190 --> 00:39:51,470
Wait, I remember that

734
00:39:51,670 --> 00:39:52,910
every time I saw him,

735
00:39:53,230 --> 00:39:54,390
he was always

736
00:39:54,390 --> 00:39:55,870
holding a small round box.

737
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:58,630
There was a woman

738
00:39:59,190 --> 00:40:00,760
holding a child on it.

739
00:40:01,430 --> 00:40:04,150
And he opened the box sometimes

740
00:40:04,190 --> 00:40:06,150
and took out some powder,

741
00:40:06,190 --> 00:40:07,910
sniffing it through his nose.

742
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:09,630
It's Snuff.

743
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:12,430
I heard that

744
00:40:12,430 --> 00:40:13,760
an western missionary
called Matteo Ricci

745
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:14,670
came across the sea.

746
00:40:15,190 --> 00:40:16,600
Among the tribute
he presented to His Majesty,

747
00:40:16,630 --> 00:40:17,670
there was Snuff.

748
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:19,080
It's a small box,

749
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:20,360
with exquisite patterns.

750
00:40:20,870 --> 00:40:22,230
It's indeed rare.

751
00:40:22,430 --> 00:40:23,630
I went to the capital

752
00:40:23,950 --> 00:40:24,910
with my father before.

753
00:40:24,910 --> 00:40:26,000
I saw it being used

754
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,120
in a noble's mansion.

755
00:40:30,950 --> 00:40:31,950
Are you alright?

756
00:40:33,910 --> 00:40:34,950
I got it.

757
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:36,320
Who?

758
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:37,430
Mr. Wu.

759
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:40,080
He's a well-known shyster in Linfen.

760
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:41,280
He's skilled at distorting facts

761
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:42,150
and helping others retract testimony.

762
00:40:42,150 --> 00:40:42,800
He succeeds every time,

763
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,150
and always makes a huge profit.

764
00:40:44,430 --> 00:40:45,390
I've seen him before.

765
00:40:45,390 --> 00:40:46,390
He was holding

766
00:40:46,390 --> 00:40:47,390
such a little thing

767
00:40:47,430 --> 00:40:49,190
and sniffing it through his nose.

768
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:51,870
Mr. Qi.

769
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:54,120
Mr. Qi, are you alright?

770
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:55,800
Mr. Qi.

771
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:56,630
So hot.

772
00:40:56,870 --> 00:40:58,120
Zhan, go get the doctor.

773
00:40:58,120 --> 00:40:58,630
Okay.

774
00:40:59,080 --> 00:40:59,870
Mr. Qi.

775
00:42:29,230 --> 00:42:30,080
You're awake.

776
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:32,520
Do you feel better?

777
00:42:32,870 --> 00:42:33,870
Yes.

778
00:42:37,390 --> 00:42:39,280
Fortunately, your fever's going down.

779
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:41,600
The doctor said you had a cold.

780
00:42:41,870 --> 00:42:43,360
It must be because
you fell into the water last time

781
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:44,190
and didn't take care of it,

782
00:42:44,190 --> 00:42:45,600
which resulted in you catching a fever.

783
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:47,800
It's my fault.

784
00:42:48,150 --> 00:42:49,230
I've been focused on the case

785
00:42:49,230 --> 00:42:50,230
that I neglected you.

786
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:52,430
I even asked you to deal with Mrs. Jin.

787
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:55,230
How can it be your fault?

788
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:57,840
I did it willingly.
