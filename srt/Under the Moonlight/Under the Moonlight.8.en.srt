[Under the Moonlight]

00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:30,060
[Adapted from the novel
"Jin Nang" by Shui He]]

3
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:33,000
[Episode 8]

4
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:35,480
Chief Luo.

5
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:39,480
Chief Luo?

6
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:52,040
Where is she?

7
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,480
Mr. Han...

8
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:08,750
Have you seen Shu?

9
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:09,720
Have you seen magistrate?

10
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,360
You can't find Shu?

11
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,240
Yeah, I've been looking for her.

12
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:17,080
went to the Mei family that night,

13
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,110
He doesn't deal

14
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:19,670
with the important drainage work,

15
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:21,270
but does a constable's job.

16
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:25,880
Do you think Feng Erlang

17
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:27,320
is innocent?

18
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:29,520
There is no evidence

19
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,390
to prove that

20
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:31,720
he didn't murder for the time being.

21
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,800
But his confession

22
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,000
shows he told us the truth.

23
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:37,190
And what Mei Hongying said

24
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:38,600
went to the Mei family that night,

25
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:41,080
So either Mei Changxiong

26
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,440
or Lu Yanru lies.

27
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:45,600
Feng Erlang

28
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,270
went to the Mei family that night,

29
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,240
but their gate wasn't locked.

30
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:50,800
Who kept the door open?

31
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,110
And who did he or she do that for?

32
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:53,750
Why was Meng Qiaosheng

33
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:55,550
naked at Hongying's bed?

34
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:57,800
And she happened to be

35
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:59,550
locked in the study all night.

36
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:00,830
And Feng Erlang

37
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:01,880
took away Meng Qiaosheng,

38
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:03,030
who got killed later.

39
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:05,030
The coincidence shows

40
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:06,880
someone did it on purpose.

41
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,080
And the murderer

42
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:11,160
must know the Mei family well.

43
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:13,000
Feng Erlang's sentence was declared.

44
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,550
The execution can't be delayed
without reason.

45
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:16,320
If we can't get new evidence

46
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,830
before the execution....

47
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,110
Shu!

48
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:23,080
Shu, wait for me!

49
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:25,110
Why didn't you

50
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:26,080
take me

51
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,160
to do the investigation?

52
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:31,270
You recently solved two cases.

53
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:32,750
I worry

54
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:33,470
you'll get too tired.

55
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:35,080
No, I don't feel tired.

56
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,320
Oh, Mr. Han,

57
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,000
Mr. Chen has been looking for you.

58
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:38,880
Please go back.

59
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:39,630
I'll support Shu

60
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:41,440
on the investigation very well.

61
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:42,830
Looking for me?

62
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:45,000
Yeah,
he has something important to report.

63
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,110
Investigating the case

64
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:48,360
can be handled by us.

65
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:50,270
Please go back now.

66
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:51,160
It can't be delayed.

67
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,830
Your Honor, there is something important.

68
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:55,600
Please go back.

69
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:02,080
Well, I'll leave the case to you.

70
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:09,600
Bye, Mr. Han.

71
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,800
Let's go for investigation.

72
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:17,440
Is Meng Qiaosheng your friend?

73
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,830
My parents aren't rich

74
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,350
but I'm from a scholar family.

75
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,350
I learned knowledge
and code of conduct as I was young.

76
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,390
I'm married,

77
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:27,790
and definitely won't know a man in private.

78
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,550
I heard

79
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:31,200
when he was teaching Mei Hongying,

80
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,830
you were there as well.

81
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:34,070
I have to do that.

82
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:36,070
Hongying is lazy

83
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:37,070
and not interested in learning.

84
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,230
I have to supervise her study.

85
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:39,350
My husband was busy all day

86
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:40,270
and rarely went home.

87
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:41,640
I had to do it.

88
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:43,320
But we'd always kept a distance

89
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:44,920
in the study.

90
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,110
Let's go to the study then.

91
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:51,640
Okay.

92
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:53,950
This way please.

93
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:56,950
This way please

94
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:04,200
Please come in.

95
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,350
This is

96
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:10,670
Mr. Meng's desk.

97
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,390
Hongying's desk and my seat
are over there.

98
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:22,350
She studied here

99
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:23,830
while I supervised her by her side.

100
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:40,070
Looks like they were written
by different persons.

101
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:42,760
The words in the beginning
were written by Hongying.

102
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:43,920
and the later part

103
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:46,160
was written by me.

104
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,230
She doesn't like studying.

105
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:50,270
But if she doesn't finish her homework,

106
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:50,760
she will

107
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,000
get a scolding from her brother.

108
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,790
[Missing you
and recalling our past for so long.
Yearning to see you here every day.
Had I known separation
could make me so sad,
I would have hoped we never met before.]

109
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:54,950
As her sister-in-law, how can I not protect her?

110
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:56,920
You took the class instead of her,

111
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,270
didn't you?

112
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,160
What do you mean?

113
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:05,270
Do you suspect

114
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:06,640
I met him in private?

115
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:10,920
I didn't mean that.

116
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:12,600
I just mentioned it unpurposely.

117
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,440
It's about my reputation.

118
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,720
You can't say it like that.

119
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:18,550
Sorry for offending you.

120
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:27,350
Look.

121
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,200
The embroidery is beautiful.

122
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,920
Do you remember this sachet?

123
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:46,760
I embroidered it.

124
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,830
We found it

125
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:50,830
in Meng Qiaosheng's house.

126
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:55,270
Oh, I know what happened.

127
00:06:56,230 --> 00:06:58,760
My husband

128
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:00,200
bought some fine silks

129
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:01,640
to make clothes for us.

130
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:03,390
Some silks were left.

131
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:04,640
Hongying wanted to make

132
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:05,480
an embroider sachet for Feng Erlang.

133
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,760
But she's not good with the skill.

134
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,550
So she asked me to make a sample.

135
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:13,200
Mr. Meng must have thought

136
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,440
that it was embroidered by Hongying

137
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,160
and took it away.

138
00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:18,070
You mean

139
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:19,920
Mr. Meng had a crush

140
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,270
on Hongying?

141
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,230
I didn't say that.

142
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:25,320
I didn't.

143
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,790
What did you say?

144
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:29,640
Hongying?

145
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:30,950
Hongying,

146
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,000
I've figured it out

147
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:35,110
that why they often

148
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:36,350
bad-mouth me all the time.

149
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:37,550
I bet you're the one who speaks ill of me!

150
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:37,920
I...

151
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:38,600
I was wondering why they knew

152
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,600
I testified in Erlang's trial.

153
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,950
Turns out you are the one
who spread the rumors.

154
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:42,440
Normally I wouldn't care

155
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,320
about the gossip.

156
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:44,830
But Erlang and I were wronged.

157
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:46,040
I would never let you off!

158
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,600
That day, Meng Qiaosheng

159
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,440
was naked at my place

160
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,600
because of you.

161
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:53,000
You're talking nonsense!

162
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,270
I bullshit?

163
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,230
You helped me every time I skipped class.

164
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:57,830
Because you two

165
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,550
could stay in private.

166
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:03,880
Hongying,

167
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:05,790
I wanted to help you.

168
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,760
Yet you slander me?

169
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:09,230
You hid Erlang's letter.

170
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:11,160
Because you feared
Changxiong would find out

171
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:12,950
I love Erlang,

172
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,440
then your affair with Qiaosheng

173
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:15,230
will be disclosed.

174
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:15,880
Is that true?

175
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:18,830
You're

176
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:19,880
talking nonsense!

177
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:21,480
Go with me to yarmen.

178
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:22,440
If you can prove you're innocent,

179
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,550
I will kowtow to apologize to you.

180
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:24,390
Otherwise,

181
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:25,350
I won't forgive you!

182
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,040
I won't let you off!

183
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:28,040
Hi, stop.

184
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,790
Okay, I'll go with you.

185
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:39,000
Yanru!

186
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:40,550
What are you doing?

187
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:41,320
Don't play tricks.

188
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,320
Open the door!

189
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:44,470
My name has been ruined by you.

190
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,110
I don't want to live.

191
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:47,400
I better die!

192
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,000
Don't threaten me by doing thus!

193
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,470
I'm not buying that.

194
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:53,030
Open the door!

195
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,200
Yanru!

196
00:08:58,760 --> 00:08:59,520
Why is it silent inside?

197
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:00,590
Yanru.

198
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:02,280
Yanru!

199
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:04,640
I...

200
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:05,710
I'll burst it open.

201
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:09,440
Can you open it?

202
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,230
Of course!

203
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,230
The door is locked from the outside.

204
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:14,080
There's only one door latch.

205
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:14,910
I can open it.

206
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:23,880
Mrs. Mei!

207
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:24,640
Yanru, come down.

208
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:25,110
Don't do this.

209
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:26,400
Don't pull her down.

210
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:26,960
It'll strangle her.

211
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:27,280
All right.

212
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:29,110
Hurry, lift her up.

213
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:29,960
Come down!

214
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,150
Yanru!

215
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:33,280
Step aside.

216
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:33,840
Yanru,

217
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,030
come down.

218
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:41,030
Yanru.

219
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:42,880
You.

220
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,880
What makes you

221
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:45,910
wanna commit suicide?

222
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:52,110
I have to die

223
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:53,520
to prove

224
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:54,640
I didn't have an affair.

225
00:09:57,350 --> 00:09:58,320
You can ask Hongying

226
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:01,440
what she said.

227
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,640
Why do you let him ask me?

228
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,030
Tell him

229
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:05,590
if you have an affair
with Meng Qiaosheng.

230
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,520
I might as well die here.

231
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:11,320
Why? You...

232
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,200
Shut up!

233
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:17,910
You trust her that much?

234
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:19,670
She's your sister-in-law

235
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,320
and my wife.

236
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:23,960
Scram!

237
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:30,880
Officers,

238
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,470
Hongying has hot temper.

239
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:33,320
She talked nonsense.

240
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,440
Don't believe what she said.

241
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:35,230
Yanru,

242
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:36,440
come on, get up.

243
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,880
You are so stupid to try to kill yourself.

244
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:45,440
Honey,

245
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:47,960
they don't believe me.

246
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:50,400
But you should believe me.

247
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:54,320
Of course, I do.

248
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:56,230
I was wronged.

249
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:59,440
I don't have an affair.

250
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:01,440
Yeah, okay.

251
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:04,230
I only want you to believe me.

252
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:08,880
Yes, I do.

253
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,520
I thought

254
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:14,440
Mrs Mei

255
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,400
and Qiaosheng

256
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:16,350
had an affair.

257
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:17,110
I never imagined

258
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:18,710
she would try to commit suicide

259
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:19,640
to prove she didn't do it.

260
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:21,320
She's quite a chaste woman.

261
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:22,880
Looks like I made a mistake.

262
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,790
You didn't.

263
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,790
I suspect

264
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:29,350
Lu Yanru had an affair with the teacher.

265
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:31,550
So I came to check it.

266
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,280
Her committing suicide

267
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,880
makes me figure out more things.

268
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:38,670
And you have the credit too.

269
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:40,590
Those poems you showed me

270
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:42,000
make me sort out

271
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
those clues.

272
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:46,150
So I have credit for it.

273
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:47,880
Yeah.

274
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:49,280
I should thank you.

275
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:50,910
How are you gonna thank me?

276
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:52,440
Let's see.

277
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:54,000
Well,

278
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:54,840
you want to thank me, right?

279
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:55,670
Don't forget it.

280
00:11:58,840 --> 00:11:59,640
Mr. Han.

281
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:00,440
Found the clue?

282
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:01,790
Wu Er visited Lu Yanru's parents' home

283
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:02,550
and came back.

284
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:03,470
He reported

285
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:04,760
she did live at her parents' home

286
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:05,910
and left the next morning.

287
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:07,230
The neighbors witnessed it.

288
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,280
Was Meng Qiaosheng crazy?

289
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:10,550
Knowing no one was in,

290
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:11,670
he still came over?

291
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:15,150
Maybe he thought

292
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:16,110
Lu Yanru was at home.

293
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,030
One of them

294
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:19,590
must be lying.

295
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,200
He's the only suspect now.

296
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,110
Mei Changxiong.

297
00:12:26,590 --> 00:12:27,350
He said

298
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:28,840
he trusted his wife.

299
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,030
But his look and reaction

300
00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:31,080
showed he lied.

301
00:12:34,590 --> 00:12:35,520
I believe you.

302
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:38,710
Captain Cai.

303
00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:39,280
Yes.

304
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:40,710
Go to the Mei family's workshop tomorrow

305
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:42,350
to investigate the places he went.

306
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:43,590
Yes.

307
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:45,350
Maybe I should go.

308
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:46,710
I will go there too.

309
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:54,960
Take care.

310
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:56,960
[Linfen Yamen]

311
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:09,840
Shu!

312
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:13,590
Why didn't you wait for me

313
00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:14,640
but went out alone?

314
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:17,280
You went to bed late last night.

315
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:18,760
So I wanted you to have a good rest.

316
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:29,350
You went to bed late last night.

317
00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:32,440
So I wanted you to have a good rest.

318
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:34,880
She indeed likes me.

319
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,110
I don't feel tired.

320
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:38,790
I'm full of energy on the case with you.

321
00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:52,150
Mr. Mei had worked here

322
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:53,280
all night.

323
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:54,880
Was he alone here?

324
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:56,670
Yeah.

325
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:57,880
But

326
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:59,280
he looked sullen

327
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:00,790
and stayed here all night.

328
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:02,590
None of us dared to talk with him.

329
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:04,880
So you didn't see him

330
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,200
stay here the whole night.

331
00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:07,670
But the light was on all night.

332
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:09,200
And he also

333
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,880
sorted a lot of leathers.

334
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:37,590
Why is there mud?

335
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:40,000
It looks like a footprint.

336
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:42,910
But it didn't

337
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:44,110
rain lately.

338
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:44,960
The road is dry

339
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,000
on our way to here.

340
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,110
That's his boat.

341
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:53,790
It's for goods transportation

342
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:54,590
and rarely used.

343
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:18,150
Look!

344
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,640
Looks like someone scratched it.

345
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:25,550
His hands curl,

346
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:27,350
with silt and bits of wood
between his fingers.

347
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:58,000
The chirping of cicadas
sounds like crying,

348
00:15:58,350 --> 00:15:59,840
while I face the pavilion
in the evening.

349
00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:04,760
Missing you
and recalling our past for so long.

350
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:08,280
Yearning to see you here every day.

351
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:13,710
Yearning to see you here every day.

352
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:17,670
Had I known separation
could make me so sad,

353
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:23,440
I would have hoped we never met before.

354
00:17:04,110 --> 00:17:05,280
He's dead.

355
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:06,950
Don't think about it.

356
00:17:08,070 --> 00:17:09,470
Can you live in peace?

357
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:12,230
Live in peace?

358
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:14,830
Ever since I married you,

359
00:17:15,710 --> 00:17:16,430
I've never lived

360
00:17:16,430 --> 00:17:17,640
a peaceful life.

361
00:17:21,830 --> 00:17:22,920
We are married.

362
00:17:24,590 --> 00:17:28,070
I offer you good food and nice dresses.

363
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:31,160
You life is better.

364
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:35,230
You think that means a good life.

365
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:39,430
I shouldn't cast pearls before swine.

366
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,430
My family had declined.

367
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:43,590
Father owed others money

368
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:44,800
and we had no choice.

369
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:45,560
Otherwise,

370
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:46,950
never would I marry such a man you.

371
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:49,640
What kind of man am I in your mind?

372
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:52,590
You're

373
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:54,400
a rough guy who is schemming.

374
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:56,590
A loser and an illiteracy.

375
00:17:58,070 --> 00:17:59,470
A macilious

376
00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:00,280
murderer!

377
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,160
You killed Mr. Meng,

378
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:10,760
didn't you?

379
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,190
And everything is plotted by you.

380
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,070
Speak!

381
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:21,950
Yes.

382
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:26,310
I killed him.

383
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:30,310
He was a poor scholar

384
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:32,830
hired by me.

385
00:18:33,430 --> 00:18:35,070
Yet he was so ungrateful

386
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:38,070
that he even seduced you!

387
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:40,950
If I didn't kill him,

388
00:18:41,710 --> 00:18:42,110
you two would

389
00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:43,800
continue making me a cuckold!

390
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,040
You could have fired him.

391
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:50,470
Why did you have to kill him!

392
00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:52,160
Why?

393
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:55,800
You know

394
00:18:59,160 --> 00:18:59,950
what he said to me?

395
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:05,000
He said Yanru's stomacher

396
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
smelled good.

397
00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:12,280
No man could stand

398
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:14,000
such a humiliation!

399
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:24,230
Why did you have to kill him?

400
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:29,590
Why?

401
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:32,680
Qiaosheng.

402
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,950
Qiaosheng!

403
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:44,680
Yanru,

404
00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:47,680
Feng Erlang will be beheaded soon.

405
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,470
It's all in the past.

406
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:53,640
Yanru, we can live a peaceful life.

407
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:55,400
I'll cherish you.

408
00:19:58,280 --> 00:19:59,310
Live with you?

409
00:20:00,430 --> 00:20:01,430
Sleeping with you,

410
00:20:01,430 --> 00:20:02,680
a murderer,

411
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:05,070
for the rest of my life?

412
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:07,110
Never!

413
00:20:08,110 --> 00:20:09,400
You murderer!

414
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:14,520
Murderer?

415
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:18,000
That's all because of you!

416
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:20,230
He was a poor scholar.

417
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:23,070
His family was destitude.

418
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,640
He was dead in poverty!

419
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:27,070
He's inferior than me!

420
00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:28,430
He's better than you.

421
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:31,040
You're nothing compared to him!

422
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:33,110
He is well-educated,

423
00:20:33,430 --> 00:20:34,590
and a gentleman.

424
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,560
He's much better than you.

425
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:39,710
I guess you love him

426
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:41,680
as he is good-looking

427
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:44,040
and favored by woman.

428
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:44,710
Exactly.

429
00:20:45,470 --> 00:20:46,070
You're a rough guy

430
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:47,710
with leather smell.

431
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,110
So I like his handsome face.

432
00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:52,000
You have nothing better than him.

433
00:20:52,590 --> 00:20:53,950
You're a hillbilly.

434
00:20:54,430 --> 00:20:55,710
Never can it be changed

435
00:20:55,710 --> 00:20:57,070
in your lifetime!

436
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:59,430
Though we're married,

437
00:20:59,710 --> 00:21:00,310
I only felt happy

438
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:02,070
when I was with him!

439
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:05,520
How dare you!

440
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:06,800
Don't you dare say it again!

441
00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:10,280
I'll strangle you!

442
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:11,950
Strangle you!

443
00:21:13,710 --> 00:21:14,710
How dare you!

444
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,560
Strangle you!

445
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,680
Good.

446
00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:21,950
Do it!

447
00:21:24,110 --> 00:21:27,800
Qiaosheng,
I'm going to meet you in heaven.

448
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:38,520
Why not strangle me?

449
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:27,830
Where are you going?

450
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:31,710
I'm going to the jail.

451
00:22:32,070 --> 00:22:32,950
Don't go.

452
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,430
Stop!

453
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:43,560
Defy me?

454
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:44,830
Let me go!

455
00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:55,040
Erlang

456
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:59,470
will be executed tomorrow.

457
00:23:00,470 --> 00:23:02,310
I'll bring him some delicious food.

458
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,310
Don't go!

459
00:23:04,310 --> 00:23:05,470
I'm still going there!

460
00:23:09,950 --> 00:23:10,760
Go inside.

461
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:12,040
No!

462
00:23:14,110 --> 00:23:15,310
Let me go.

463
00:23:15,430 --> 00:23:15,950
Go into the room!

464
00:23:15,950 --> 00:23:16,920
Let me go!

465
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:18,560
Hands off!

466
00:23:32,350 --> 00:23:34,070
For Feng Erlang,

467
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:38,070
you don't even want our home.

468
00:23:40,430 --> 00:23:41,230
Changxiong,

469
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:44,710
you leave me

470
00:23:44,710 --> 00:23:46,950
no choice.

471
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,280
If Erlang dies,

472
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:52,470
I'll die with him.

473
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:54,710
Don't you dare do it!

474
00:23:56,350 --> 00:23:57,160
Hongying,

475
00:23:58,110 --> 00:23:59,950
you're so stubborn!

476
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:02,110
Everything I did

477
00:24:02,110 --> 00:24:03,280
is for your

478
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,640
own good.

479
00:24:07,830 --> 00:24:08,800
For my own good?

480
00:24:10,430 --> 00:24:12,830
You said this again.

481
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:14,590
But

482
00:24:14,590 --> 00:24:16,310
do you know what I want?

483
00:24:17,110 --> 00:24:18,680
What you did

484
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:19,950
isn't what I want at all, okay?

485
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:23,280
I grew up with Erlang.

486
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,190
He loves me

487
00:24:25,190 --> 00:24:26,350
and I love him too.

488
00:24:28,110 --> 00:24:29,830
I'm happy being with him.

489
00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:32,560
Do you even know the happiness?

490
00:24:33,350 --> 00:24:34,190
You can't bear

491
00:24:34,190 --> 00:24:35,640
I'm happier than you are.

492
00:24:37,470 --> 00:24:38,310
Changxiong,

493
00:24:39,310 --> 00:24:40,710
you know nothing about love.

494
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:45,000
What?

495
00:24:45,710 --> 00:24:46,800
You're young,

496
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:47,800
inexperienced in life.

497
00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:51,640
Hongyong, you have a good future.

498
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:52,590
I need to make sure

499
00:24:52,590 --> 00:24:54,830
you live in the right way

500
00:24:54,830 --> 00:24:56,520
and have a better life!

501
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:58,040
How pathetic you are!

502
00:24:59,950 --> 00:25:00,830
So hilarious.

503
00:25:02,070 --> 00:25:04,310
You suffer from your vanity.

504
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,400
Your life is completely a mess

505
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,110
but you still want to control my life.

506
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:17,710
Why?

507
00:25:18,430 --> 00:25:19,590
Am I wrong?

508
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:22,920
You married

509
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:24,680
a First-Degree Scholar's daughter.

510
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:27,110
You loved her dearly.

511
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:29,350
Then what happened?

512
00:25:30,350 --> 00:25:32,280
Has she ever loved you?

513
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,400
Stop!

514
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:35,560
Stop!

515
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:38,190
Stop it.

516
00:25:39,230 --> 00:25:40,230
Stop.

517
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,070
Hongying,

518
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,230
if I agree

519
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:07,710
with you marrying

520
00:26:07,710 --> 00:26:09,070
Erlang,

521
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:12,110
won't you regret it

522
00:26:14,430 --> 00:26:15,400
if you live in poverty with him?

523
00:26:20,190 --> 00:26:21,160
No, I won't.

524
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:24,110
It's better than marrying a rich man

525
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,680
who doesn't love me at all.

526
00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:28,400
I'd rather marry Erlang.

527
00:26:28,950 --> 00:26:30,470
I can still be happy.

528
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:32,000
We don't need much money.

529
00:26:32,470 --> 00:26:33,230
If the two of us

530
00:26:33,230 --> 00:26:34,160
work hard,

531
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:35,800
our life will get better,

532
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:37,710
right?

533
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:45,110
Changxiong,

534
00:26:46,470 --> 00:26:47,310
you even improved your life

535
00:26:47,310 --> 00:26:49,350
by your own efforts.

536
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,070
But it's useless

537
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:05,680
to say it now.

538
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:28,110
I understand.

539
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,000
I just don't want you to suffer.

540
00:28:12,470 --> 00:28:13,280
Changxiong.

541
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:13,230
Maintain order!

542
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:18,600
[People's Court]

543
00:29:24,190 --> 00:29:25,040
Mei Changxiong,

544
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:27,710
confess how you killed the victim.

545
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,680
I was selling the goods that day.

546
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:34,920
Came back earlier than usual.

547
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:37,880
Mr. Chen, bye.

548
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,190
Bye.

549
00:29:42,430 --> 00:29:44,590
Erlang, give it back to me.

550
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:47,560
Mr. Mei,

551
00:29:47,830 --> 00:29:49,350
is she Hongying?

552
00:29:59,950 --> 00:30:01,640
She is supposed to have class now.

553
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:03,350
Why does she come out?

554
00:30:43,350 --> 00:30:47,880
Missing you
and recalling our past for so long.

555
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:52,400
Yearning to see you here every day.

556
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:58,880
Had I known separation
could make me so sad...

557
00:31:27,310 --> 00:31:28,110
Yanru,

558
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:30,520
I saw you...

559
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:31,230
You didn't take a shower again

560
00:31:31,230 --> 00:31:32,350
after working, right?

561
00:31:33,190 --> 00:31:34,350
I've told you many times

562
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:35,520
I don't like the smell.

563
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:37,070
Go to take a shower.

564
00:31:41,830 --> 00:31:42,640
No need.

565
00:31:43,710 --> 00:31:45,110
I have to go to work tomorrow anyway.

566
00:31:46,110 --> 00:31:48,070
Won't be back for a few days.

567
00:32:03,950 --> 00:32:05,400
I'm going to sleep in the study.

568
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,040
I'll go to the workshop.

569
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:42,430
They just

570
00:32:42,430 --> 00:32:44,800
hooked up under my nose

571
00:32:46,590 --> 00:32:48,830
and ignored me.

572
00:32:49,710 --> 00:32:50,800
It was so hard for me

573
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:52,040
those few days.

574
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:54,590
I was annoyed and perplexed.

575
00:32:58,350 --> 00:32:59,520
But then

576
00:33:01,230 --> 00:33:02,310
Feng Erlang

577
00:33:02,310 --> 00:33:03,520
came to see me.

578
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:05,350
Can we talk it over?

579
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:06,430
No need!

580
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:07,680
With his lowly status?

581
00:33:08,430 --> 00:33:09,280
He doesn't deserve her.

582
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:11,040
You tell me

583
00:33:11,230 --> 00:33:12,070
what should I do
so that I can marry her?

584
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:13,520
Mr. Zhang has come to talk

585
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:14,590
about the bride price.

586
00:33:15,310 --> 00:33:16,190
You have to offer

587
00:33:16,190 --> 00:33:17,280
more than that.

588
00:33:17,430 --> 00:33:18,830
Or you can just give up.

589
00:33:19,070 --> 00:33:20,560
Fine. How much do you want?

590
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:22,310
At least 200 liang.

591
00:33:24,110 --> 00:33:25,590
If you offer that much,

592
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,560
I can agree with your marriage.

593
00:33:30,950 --> 00:33:31,800
Wait for me.

594
00:33:32,430 --> 00:33:33,520
I'll do whatever it takes

595
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:35,190
to get the money.

596
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:45,350
Chongxiong,

597
00:33:46,230 --> 00:33:47,280
why did you do that?

598
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:50,760
You treat me

599
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:51,590
like I'm your goods.

600
00:33:52,110 --> 00:33:53,310
I'm doing this for your own good.

601
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:01,880
And how did you know

602
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:03,190
they were going to elope?

603
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:05,040
After Feng Erlang left,

604
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:06,310
I regretted what I said.

605
00:34:07,110 --> 00:34:09,040
I shouldn't have said that to him.

606
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:11,630
I feared he would

607
00:34:11,630 --> 00:34:13,430
kill others for money.

608
00:34:13,430 --> 00:34:14,840
So I went to his home

609
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:17,120
and explained it to his mother.

610
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:20,150
I told her I didn't need his money.

611
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:22,600
I just wanted Erlang

612
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:24,230
to give up on Hongying.

613
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:27,150
You're rich.

614
00:34:27,430 --> 00:34:28,800
We're not the right choice for you.

615
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:29,800
I can understand.

616
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:31,430
It's not like that.

617
00:34:31,430 --> 00:34:33,320
That's because

618
00:34:33,910 --> 00:34:35,150
they're not a good match.

619
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:37,800
Bye.

620
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:45,520
Why are you laughing?

621
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:46,430
He loves to laugh.

622
00:34:46,470 --> 00:34:47,430
Don't do this.

623
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:49,190
Why do you laugh as it's not laughable?

624
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:51,430
Go.

625
00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:03,950
Mr. Mei.

626
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:07,430
You drank a lot.

627
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:09,670
Did he tell you?

628
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:13,000
Feng Erlang is my childhood friend.

629
00:35:13,390 --> 00:35:14,390
He told me everything

630
00:35:14,390 --> 00:35:15,600
when we were drinking.

631
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:16,670
What did he say?

632
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:18,120
Mr. Mei,

633
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:20,000
on the night of the day after tomorrow,

634
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:20,760
Hongying is gonna

635
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,630
elope with Erlang.

636
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:25,600
Yanru cheated on me.

637
00:35:27,710 --> 00:35:29,560
Hongying wanted to elope.

638
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:34,000
Why did the two woman

639
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,520
I cherished

640
00:35:37,870 --> 00:35:39,430
wanna betray me?

641
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:43,040
I've been thinking about it

642
00:35:43,430 --> 00:35:45,870
and finally figured it out.

643
00:35:47,230 --> 00:35:48,390
The two men

644
00:35:48,390 --> 00:35:49,800
caused the trouble.

645
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:51,630
As soon as they disappeared,

646
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:52,710
my life

647
00:35:52,710 --> 00:35:54,280
could go back to normal.

648
00:35:54,630 --> 00:35:55,360
My family

649
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:56,760
will be intact.

650
00:35:58,950 --> 00:36:00,630
So you plotted to kill him
by Feng Erlang's hand.

651
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:19,630
Mr. Meng,

652
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:21,800
my wife doesn't feel well.

653
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:23,000
She rests inside.

654
00:36:23,150 --> 00:36:25,080
I'll supervise Hongying's study.

655
00:36:26,950 --> 00:36:28,560
You're always busy with business.

656
00:36:28,910 --> 00:36:31,760
How come you're free toady?

657
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:33,080
After watching Hongying

658
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:36,000
reading the book,

659
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,430
I'm going back to the workshop,

660
00:36:37,430 --> 00:36:38,710
and stay there all night

661
00:36:38,710 --> 00:36:39,800
to work.

662
00:36:50,230 --> 00:36:51,910
After Hongying having the class,

663
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:54,800
I locked her in the study.

664
00:37:00,190 --> 00:37:01,000
Changxiong.

665
00:37:04,710 --> 00:37:06,000
Don't come out until you finish copying.

666
00:37:06,230 --> 00:37:07,630
Why don't you let me out?

667
00:37:08,190 --> 00:37:09,120
Changxiong!

668
00:37:09,470 --> 00:37:10,870
This is bullying.

669
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:14,560
Mr. Mei,

670
00:37:14,630 --> 00:37:15,670
why do you come here

671
00:37:15,670 --> 00:37:16,470
so late tonight?

672
00:38:45,950 --> 00:38:47,080
Put it under Changxiong's door.

673
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:47,870
Okay.

674
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:58,520
[To Mei Changxiong]

675
00:39:10,190 --> 00:39:11,600
I thought

676
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:13,800
Erlang would piss off

677
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:14,870
and kill Meng Qiaosheng.

678
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:16,950
Then I wouldn't have to kill him

679
00:39:17,630 --> 00:39:19,280
but could get rid of both of them.

680
00:39:21,470 --> 00:39:22,630
Yet...

681
00:39:26,710 --> 00:39:27,760
Where is Hongying?

682
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:29,840
Where is she?

683
00:39:30,230 --> 00:39:31,080
Erlang didn't kill him

684
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:33,120
and even

685
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:35,360
watch him fleeing.

686
00:39:35,390 --> 00:39:36,430
Where is Hongying?

687
00:39:36,950 --> 00:39:38,520
Maybe Erlang didn't believe

688
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:39,430
Hongying would

689
00:39:39,430 --> 00:39:40,840
betray him.

690
00:39:43,430 --> 00:39:44,470
So I have to

691
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:48,560
kill Meng Qiaosheng myself.

692
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:05,360
Help! Help me!

693
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:49,470
I killed him.

694
00:40:50,910 --> 00:40:52,190
It has nothing to do with Feng Erlang.

695
00:40:55,630 --> 00:40:56,470
I plead guilty.
