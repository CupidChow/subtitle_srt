00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,790
Mr. Cai, what brings you here?

195
00:10:57,790 --> 00:10:58,670
It's a long story.

196
00:10:58,670 --> 00:10:59,280
Tell me.

197
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:01,000
Who sent you to follow Miss Luo?

198
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:01,880
Mr. Cai.

199
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:05,640
Go back and tell Qin Yi

200
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:07,000
to stop these little tricks.

201
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:16,960
Who is Qin Yi?

202
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:18,280
Where is Mr. Qi?

203
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:19,840
It's a long story.

204
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:20,960
Why did you

205
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,230
suddenly come to Taiyuan?

206
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:23,670
He came with me.

207
00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:26,590
Your Honor!

208
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,400
Did you suddenly come to Taiyuan

209
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:32,640
because Linfen
is starting to face a grain shortage?

210
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:36,320
The grain shortage in Linfen is severe.

211
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:37,520
We came to Taiyuan

212
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:38,960
to request relief grain.

213
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:39,790
And also to see

214
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:41,200
if there is any surplus grain available.

215
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:43,640
I just saw you being followed.

216
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:44,470
I was afraid you...

217
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:48,910
We were afraid you were in danger

218
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:49,910
so we followed you.

219
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:53,280
Thank you, Your Honor, and Mr. Cai.

220
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,080
You're welcome.

221
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:55,880
Why are you alone?

222
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,000
Where is Mr. Qi?

223
00:11:57,110 --> 00:11:58,640
His brother suddenly passed away.

224
00:11:58,640 --> 00:11:59,960
He went back to take care of things.

225
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,520
So you...

226
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:03,080
I'm staying at an inn.

227
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,760
He and I just arrived in Taiyuan.

228
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:06,590
We haven't gone to the post yet.

229
00:12:06,590 --> 00:12:07,110
Your Honor,

230
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:08,520
why don't we stay at the same inn

231
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:09,400
as Miss Luo?

232
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,400
It would be safer.

233
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:12,320
Good idea.

234
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,110
Notify all grain stores.

235
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:20,280
Hurry up and buy grain.

236
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:21,280
Cut off the grain supply.

237
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:23,440
Let those merchants know

238
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,400
I want all the grain they have.

239
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:26,960
Understood.

240
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:32,150
Master, grain prices are so high now.

241
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,080
Will those merchants

242
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,280
listen to us?

243
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:37,280
Whoever dares to sell grain privately

244
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,640
will be my enemy.

245
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:43,960
A mere magistrate of Linfen

246

wants to be a hero and save the beauty?

00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,030

Yes.

Hello, Muzhi.

00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,230
Mr. Liu.

261
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,440
You've lost quite a bit of weight.

262
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,790

Bring tea.

265
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:42,520
Mr. Liu,

266
00:14:43,710 --> 00:14:44,520
I've heard

267
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:46,030
the court's relief grain has arrived.

268
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:48,440
Not yet,

269
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:49,710
but it should be soon.

270
00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:50,880
Within a few days.

271
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:53,150
That's great news.

272
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:55,880
In that case,

273
00:14:56,030 --> 00:14:57,910
I'll stay in Taiyuan a few more days.

274
00:14:58,030 --> 00:14:59,230
Once the relief grain arrives,

275
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:01,470
I'll take it back to Linfen.

276
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,230
Muzhi,

277
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:07,320
this batch of grain

278
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:08,520
will probably be prioritized

279
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:10,030
for those counties most affected.

280
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:11,790
Your Linfen...

281
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:13,710
Mr. Liu, you may not know,

282
00:15:14,110 --> 00:15:14,880
the disaster situation in Linfen

283
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,350
is urgent and cannot wait.

284
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:17,790
Yes, indeed.

285
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:20,000
You are the magistrate of Linfen.

286
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:22,230
Of course,
you can only see Linfen's plight.

287
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:24,520
But I am the provincial governor.

288
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:26,840
I need to oversee the disaster situation
across the province.

289
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:28,880
To be honest,

290
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:29,910
due to your effective locust control,

291
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:31,350
Linfen

292
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:32,710
has actually been less affected

293
00:15:32,710 --> 00:15:34,520
among these counties.

294
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:37,910
Look at Yangqu, Shouyang, and Taigu.

295
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:39,030
Which county isn't facing

296
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:40,280
a more serious disaster?

297
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:41,280
Mr. Liu.

298
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:46,350
The impact of locusts on Linfen

299
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:47,470
is indeed not severe.

300
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,350
But the people from neighboring counties

301
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:50,520
are flooding into Linfen.

302
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,520
Currently,
the number of victims is surging,

303
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:54,030
and our food supply
is down to less than two days.

304
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:56,840
So I earnestly request you

305
00:15:57,030 --> 00:15:58,710
to allocate grain for disaster relief

306
00:15:58,760 --> 00:15:59,840
as soon as possible.

307
00:16:02,590 --> 00:16:03,400
Be patient.

308
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:06,000
Just wait a little longer.

309
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,350
When the next batch of grain arrives,

310
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:10,440
it will be prioritized for Linfen.

311
00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:12,110
I can wait,

312
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:15,080
but the victims cannot.

313
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:17,230
This matter concerns lives,

314
00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:18,670
and cannot be delayed.

315
00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:20,880
The overall situation is paramount.

316
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:23,520
The overall situation is paramount.

317
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:40,760
You are a provincial governor,

318
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:43,000
so you must act fairly.

319
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:44,470
However,

320
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:50,400
you're also my future father-in-law.

321
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:53,760
As your future son-in-law,

322
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:57,400
I beg for your leniency.

323
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:02,110
Mr. Han,

324
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,830
it's not easy

325
00:17:04,830 --> 00:17:06,310
for you to say this.

326
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:09,400
With all your pride, Mr. Han,

327
00:17:09,950 --> 00:17:11,520
have you learned

328
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,190
to bow and beg?

329
00:17:21,070 --> 00:17:21,880
Good.

330
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:25,310
Good.

331
00:17:26,830 --> 00:17:27,640
Very good.

332
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:30,040
Since you, Mr. Han,

333
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:31,680
have chosen to talk
about personal matters

334
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,710
instead of official business

335
00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:36,710
I will

336
00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:38,110
speak frankly with you.

337
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:39,760
Mr. Han,

338
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,040
you say I am delaying,

339
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:44,920
but how long

340
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:46,590
has the marriage between you and Wan

341
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:49,430
been delayed?

342
00:17:54,190 --> 00:17:56,310
Sometimes I can't help but wonder,

343
00:17:57,310 --> 00:17:59,920
did you have other intentions

344
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:03,640
in agreeing to this marriage,

345
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:04,520
Mr. Han?

346
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,230
You know very well,

347
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,430
I only have this one daughter.

348
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:14,110
My greatest wish

349
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:17,070
is to find her a good husband

350
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,560
who won't let her suffer.

351
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,470
Think carefully

352
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:24,470
about what you should do.

353
00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:26,800
Consider it seriously.

354
00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:27,920
By the way,

355
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,310
this time, the grain

356
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,350
cannot be given to you.

357
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:34,640
But there are still ways.

358
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:37,230
You can buy or borrow.

359
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:38,640
In any case,

360
00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:42,830
the lives of the victims
are the most important.

361
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,190
Somebody!

362
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:48,040
Serve Mr. Han a cup of hot tea.

363
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:11,760
Father.

364
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:12,950
Please sit.

365
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:21,160
Your brother has passed away,

366
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,280
but the Qi family's reputation

367
00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:26,800
must still be upheld.

368
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:28,110
So today,

369
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:29,710
I called you two over

370

this matter.

372
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:36,590
Regarding the arrangements
for Fengzhou's affairs,

373
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:38,800
we owe a lot to Yanjin.

374
00:20:39,470 --> 00:20:41,640
Yanjin, you're meticulous

375
00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:42,950
and organized in your work.

376

With you around,

377
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:48,760
I can rest easy.

378
00:20:49,310 --> 00:20:50,680
To be able to ease your worries

379
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,110
and contribute to the Qi family

380
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:53,520
is my duty as a son.

381
00:20:58,110 --> 00:20:59,000
What about you?

382
00:20:59,430 --> 00:21:01,190
You seem lost.

383
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:02,920
From now on,

384
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:04,590
you must be more alert,

385
00:21:04,590 --> 00:21:05,880
and work harder,

386
00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:08,880
so that you can shoulder

387
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:12,000
the responsibilities of the Qi family
in the future.

388
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:15,350
You must understand
that Fengzhou is gone,

389
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:17,470
and all the burdens

390
00:21:18,430 --> 00:21:20,430
fall on your shoulders now.

391
00:21:21,430 --> 00:21:22,880
Father, but there's also Yan...

392
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:25,040
I have already discussed

393
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,190
with the Governor
of Zhejiang and Nanzhili.

394
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:27,560
I plan to have you

395
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:29,640
marry his second legitimate daughter.

396
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:31,400
This marriage

397
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,190
benefits

398
00:21:33,230 --> 00:21:34,160
both our families.

399
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,310
I cannot marry her.

400
00:21:37,710 --> 00:21:39,520
What do you mean?

401
00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:41,760
What time is it right now?

402
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,800
Why are you still being so willful?

403
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:45,070
Marriage is a serious matter.

404
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:46,640
It is about the parents' orders

405
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:47,830
and the matchmaker's words.

406
00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:49,350
The family has been patient with you,

407
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:51,070
allowing you to play around
for so many years.

408
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,950
It's time to get serious.

409
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:54,800
Father, I really cannot marry her.

410
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:56,400
You are my son.

411
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,160
If you don't marry her, who will?

412
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,230
What about Yanjin?

413
00:21:59,310 --> 00:22:00,470
He is unmarried as well.

414
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:01,800
Though Yanjin is cultivating,

415
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:03,400
he is still a layman.

416
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,310
In terms of talent,
ability, and character,

417
00:22:05,310 --> 00:22:06,520
he surpasses me in every way.

418
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:07,710
This is simply absurd!

419
00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:09,830
Yanjin is an illegitimate son.

420
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:11,070
How could he marry

421
00:22:11,070 --> 00:22:12,310
the governor's legitimate daughter?

422
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:17,920
I don't care about the distinctions

423
00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:19,560
between legitimate and illegitimate.

424
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:20,110
When did the Qi family

425
00:22:20,110 --> 00:22:21,160
have such rules?

426
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:22,560
I only know he is my brother,

427
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:23,950
someone I admire

428
00:22:23,950 --> 00:22:25,560
and the Qi family can be proud of.

429
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:28,800
I'm telling you,

430
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:30,430
the matter is settled.

431
00:22:30,710 --> 00:22:32,590
You have to marry her,

432
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:34,760
whether you like it or not.

433
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:41,640
I am sorry,

434
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:43,310
but I cannot marry Miss Wei,

435
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:44,640
because

436
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:47,160
I have already
pledged my life to another.

437
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:49,520
Pledged your life to another?

438
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:52,040
Who?

439
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:53,950
Luo Shu.

440
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,310
She has no prominent background.

441
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:57,830
Once,

442
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,710
she was a constable in Linfen Yamen.

443
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,920
A woman as a constable?

444
00:23:02,470 --> 00:23:04,190
That's truly a strange tale.

445
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:05,800
What sort of people are her parents?

446
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:06,950
I don't believe

447
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:08,560
there could be any good family

448
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:09,920
that would let their daughter

449
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:10,920
become a lowly constable.

450
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:11,950
She has no parents.

451
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:13,880
She became a constable

452
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:14,800
through her own efforts.

453
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:16,800
But she has never wallowed in self-pity.

454
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:18,520
You will see for yourself,

455
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:19,000
she is a woman

456
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,400
who is pure despite the mud.

457
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:23,400
Pure despite the mud?

458
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:27,040
What is her background?

459
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:30,400
Tell me!

460
00:23:31,350 --> 00:23:32,160
Tell me!

461
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:40,310
You and your brother
have always been close.

462
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:42,590
Do you know about this?

463
00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:48,160
Say it!

464
00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:49,350
Say it!

465
00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:50,950
Father, I will say it!

466
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:54,520
She comes from a lowly background,

467
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:55,830
but she has already

468
00:23:55,830 --> 00:23:56,590
changed her status

469
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:58,590
and solved many major cases
at the yamen.

470
00:23:58,640 --> 00:23:59,710
Lowly background?

471
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,160
Was she from a music house?

472
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:03,400
She was merely a performer

473
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:03,950
who played music

474
00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:04,950
and sang there.

475
00:24:04,950 --> 00:24:06,350
What a wretched son you are!

476
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:08,160
You are truly infuriating me.

477
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:10,470
For the sake of a lowly woman,

478
00:24:10,470 --> 00:24:12,590
you're willing to ruin your own future

479
00:24:12,590 --> 00:24:13,710
and drag the Qi family down

480
00:24:13,710 --> 00:24:15,000
with you.

481
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:15,950
Come here!

482
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:18,430
Take this ungrateful child away!

483
00:24:18,430 --> 00:24:19,520
Beat him to death!

484
00:24:20,190 --> 00:24:21,310
If beating me will relieve your anger,

485
00:24:21,310 --> 00:24:22,280
just go ahead and beat me!

486
00:24:22,710 --> 00:24:24,070
I will definitely marry Luo Shu!

487
00:24:24,070 --> 00:24:25,760
I will marry no one but Luo Shu!

488
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:26,590
Give me!

489
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,040
You're so ungrateful!

490
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:30,190
If I don't beat you,

491
00:24:30,190 --> 00:24:32,000
I won't feel better!

492
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:33,040
I will beat you!

493
00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:34,280
I will beat you!

494
00:24:34,310 --> 00:24:35,680
I will beat you!

495
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:36,710
Stop!

496
00:24:36,830 --> 00:24:37,640
Stop!

497
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:39,800
Stop!

498
00:24:40,590 --> 00:24:41,350
Mother!

499
00:24:41,350 --> 00:24:43,680
What are you doing?

500
00:24:44,590 --> 00:24:47,040
I have already lost a grandson.

501
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:48,160
Why are you...?

502
00:24:48,950 --> 00:24:49,640
You're trying to kill

503
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:52,040
my other grandson?

504
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:54,040
Mother!

505
00:24:54,230 --> 00:24:55,280
Mother, calm down.

506
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:56,230
Please listen to me.

507
00:24:56,230 --> 00:24:57,280
He said he wants to marry

508
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:59,310
a woman of ill repute, Mother!

509
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:01,640
Luo Shu is not a woman of ill repute!

510
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:02,590
Shut up!

511
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:03,640
If you want to kill me,

512
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:04,590
just do it!

513
00:25:04,590 --> 00:25:05,710
I will definitely marry her!

514
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:06,470
Just watch me today,

515
00:25:06,470 --> 00:25:07,880
to see if I can kill you!

516
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:10,830
I'll beat you to death.

517
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,280
I'll beat...

518
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:13,160
Mother!

519
00:25:13,310 --> 00:25:13,950
Mother!

520
00:25:14,110 --> 00:25:14,710
Mother!

521
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:16,040
Mother!

522
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:16,920
Mother!

523
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:17,950
Get a doctor!

524
00:25:18,070 --> 00:25:18,950
Get a doctor!

525
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:22,400
Quick! Someone!

526
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,680
Hurry and find a doctor!

527
00:25:23,830 --> 00:25:25,160
Slow down. Be careful.

528
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:26,110
Young Master!

529
00:25:26,110 --> 00:25:27,830
Quick, go get the doctor!

530
00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:28,350
Young Master!

531
00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:29,190
Be careful!

532
00:25:29,190 --> 00:25:30,430
What happened to Young Master?

533
00:25:58,070 --> 00:25:58,880
Luo Shu!

534
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:05,950
Your Honor.

535
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:07,310
Please come in.

536
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:14,160
Please sit down.

537
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:15,430
Okay.

538
00:26:22,110 --> 00:26:24,280
What's wrong? You look unwell.

539
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:26,520
I just felt a bit anxious earlier.

540
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,000
It should be nothing serious.

541
00:26:28,470 --> 00:26:30,000
Did you go to see Mr. Liu?

542
00:26:30,110 --> 00:26:31,310
Were you able to get the relief grain?

543
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:32,560
Mr. Liu said

544
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:33,880
that the first batch of relief grain

545
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:34,470
has to be given first

546
00:26:34,470 --> 00:26:36,110
to the counties
with more severe disasters.

547
00:26:36,110 --> 00:26:37,160
Our Linfen County

548
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:38,400
will have to wait for the next batch.

549
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,430
How can this be?

550
00:26:39,710 --> 00:26:40,880
Right now, other counties' victims

551
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:41,830
are all flocking to Linfen.

552
00:26:42,070 --> 00:26:43,880
Linfen needs food the most!

553
00:26:44,350 --> 00:26:45,430
But he just gave me

554
00:26:45,430 --> 00:26:46,920
a bunch of grandiose reasons,

555
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:49,000
and even used the relief grain
to threaten me.

556
00:26:50,710 --> 00:26:52,800
What do you plan to do next?

557
00:26:53,310 --> 00:26:54,590
Are you just going back to Linfen?

558
00:26:54,590 --> 00:26:55,070
No.

559
00:26:56,070 --> 00:26:57,760
I plan to borrow
grain from the grain stores

560
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:59,070
and wealthy ones in Taiyuan.

561
00:26:59,190 --> 00:27:00,680
It's just that
the interest will be higher.

562
00:27:01,950 --> 00:27:02,590
As long as I can alleviate

563
00:27:02,590 --> 00:27:04,230
the urgent needs
of the people in Linfen,

564
00:27:04,310 --> 00:27:05,520
I'm willing to give it a try.

565
00:27:21,710 --> 00:27:22,880
- Young Master.
- Young Master.

566
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:29,310
Why am I here?

567
00:27:31,190 --> 00:27:32,000
Where's my father?

568
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:33,920
He is not here.

569
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:36,560
No,

570
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:39,110
I must talk to him.

571
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:45,280
Lian Shu, quick!

572
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:47,430
Have me carried to my father.

573
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:49,710
I cannot agree to this marriage.

574
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:50,520
Hurry.

575
00:27:50,830 --> 00:27:51,640
Young Master,

576
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:53,070
you are seriously injured.

577
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:55,040
Don't provoke his anger.

578
00:27:55,230 --> 00:27:56,560
Let's take it slow, alright?

579
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:57,310
Slow won't do!

580
00:27:58,310 --> 00:28:00,110
If we wait for a couple of days,

581
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:02,310
this marriage would be a done deal.

582
00:28:02,590 --> 00:28:03,400
Hurry!

583
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:04,430
Young Master.

584
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:05,400
Hurry!

585
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:08,520
No!

586
00:28:16,310 --> 00:28:17,110
Young Master.

587
00:28:17,310 --> 00:28:18,110
Young Master!

588
00:28:18,110 --> 00:28:19,800
Please lie back down, Young Master!

589
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,760
I will go get someone to carry you!

590
00:28:25,430 --> 00:28:26,880
Mr. Menglin wants to see his father.

591
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:28,920
I'm sorry, Mr. Menglin.

592
00:28:28,950 --> 00:28:30,230
Don't cause a fuss.

593
00:28:30,310 --> 00:28:31,350
Your father said,

594
00:28:31,350 --> 00:28:32,430
unless you apologize,

595
00:28:32,590 --> 00:28:34,430
don't even think
about leaving this courtyard.

596
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:40,560
Lian Shu, quick!

597
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:42,350
Go get Yanjin!

598
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:43,310
Young Master.

599
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:44,520
Hurry up!

600
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:45,680
Yes.

601
00:28:57,950 --> 00:28:58,760
Yanjin.

602
00:29:04,430 --> 00:29:05,880
I'm sorry for troubling you, Yanjin.

603
00:29:07,430 --> 00:29:08,230
You!

604
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:12,310
This is
from the Daoist priest of Taifu Temple.

605
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:14,000
It's good
for promoting blood circulation.

606
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:15,310
You should try it.

607
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:17,590
Yanjin.

608
00:29:20,110 --> 00:29:20,920
Yanjin.

609
00:29:22,110 --> 00:29:23,680
You've always been the kindest to me.

610
00:29:24,350 --> 00:29:25,280
I beg you.

611
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:28,640
Help me talk to Father, okay?

612
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:34,190
What am I supposed to say?

613
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:35,560
Just say

614
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:37,350
that you will take over from Fengzhou!

615
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:39,310
Yanjin,

616
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:41,280
what I said today in front of Father

617
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:42,710
was all from the heart.

618
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:45,040
I've never had big ambitions.

619
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:46,880
If the family business were in my hands,

620
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,400
it would surely be ruined.

621
00:29:49,590 --> 00:29:50,470
But Yanjin,

622
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:53,040
you are different.

623
00:29:53,470 --> 00:29:55,000
You have always been talented,

624
00:29:55,710 --> 00:29:58,070
and over the years
you have managed the family well.

625
00:29:58,920 --> 00:29:59,880
The family business should naturally be

626
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:00,920
your responsibility.

627
00:30:04,710 --> 00:30:05,950
There's a distinction
between legitimate and illegitimate.

628
00:30:05,950 --> 00:30:06,680
Yanjin,

629
00:30:08,190 --> 00:30:09,520
why do you say that?

630
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:11,190
What distinction is there?

631
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:12,160
You and Fengzhou

632
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:13,520
are both Father's sons

633
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:14,470
and my brothers.

634
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
I admire Fengzhou

635
00:30:16,110 --> 00:30:17,230
and I admire you just the same.

636
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:22,830
What you think doesn't matter.

637
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,070
Yanjin,

638
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:29,520
please at least consider talking to him.

639
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:30,310
I'm useless.

640
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:31,070
No matter what I say,

641
00:30:31,070 --> 00:30:32,000
Father won't listen.

642
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:32,760
But you are different...

643
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:33,560
Enough!

644
00:30:35,710 --> 00:30:36,560
I've told you,

645
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:39,400
I can't help you.

646
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:40,680
Good night.

647
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:42,350
What a stupid family business!

648
00:30:42,350 --> 00:30:43,470
I don't want it!

649
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:46,280
Nonsense!

650
00:30:46,950 --> 00:30:48,310
It's what others dream of.

651
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:49,470
You can obtain it

652
00:30:49,470 --> 00:30:50,280
without any effort,

653
00:30:50,430 --> 00:30:51,640
but you don't know how to cherish it.

654
00:30:52,710 --> 00:30:54,560
You really should reflect on yourself.

655
00:31:03,590 --> 00:31:04,400
In any case,

656
00:31:06,070 --> 00:31:07,560
once Father makes a decision,

657
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:10,880
I can't change it.

658
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:14,560
Yanjin, I have my own decision.

659
00:31:17,110 --> 00:31:17,920
I don't want

660
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:20,830
or deserve it.

661
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:23,470
The family business should

662
00:31:23,470 --> 00:31:24,350
be in your hands.

663
00:31:25,830 --> 00:31:27,230
No matter how many times Father asks me,

664
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:28,950
I will always give this answer.

665
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:44,070
Young Master, have some porridge.

666
00:31:45,230 --> 00:31:46,280
From today on,

667
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:48,230
don't let the kitchen

668
00:31:48,230 --> 00:31:49,640
prepare food for me anymore.

669
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:52,520
I won't eat anything

670
00:31:53,310 --> 00:31:54,520
until my father changes his mind.

671
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:01,350
Mr. Yanjin,

672
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:03,710
it's from Mr. Qin.

673
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:09,220
[To Qi Yanjin]

674
00:32:12,750 --> 00:32:13,220
[Let's meet and talk.
From Qin Yi]

675
00:32:26,350 --> 00:32:27,760
Dasheng Grain Store.

676
00:32:27,940 --> 00:32:28,310
[Dasheng Grain Store]

677
00:32:28,310 --> 00:32:29,230
[Dasheng Grain Store]
This is it.

678
00:32:29,230 --> 00:32:30,660
[Dasheng Grain Store]

679
00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:31,760
Let's go.

680
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:35,220
[Dasheng Grain Store]

681
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:36,300
[Price of Rice
One Qian Three Wen per Dou]

682
00:32:40,470 --> 00:32:42,110
Sir, do you still have grain?

683
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:43,710
No.

684
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:46,590
There's no grain in the store.
What about the warehouse?

685
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:48,400
We need a large quantity.

686
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,640
Whatever you have, we'll take it.

687
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:51,110
There's no grain anywhere.

688
00:32:51,350 --> 00:32:53,280
This year,
we haven't seen any new grain.

689
00:32:53,470 --> 00:32:54,310
Why is that?

690
00:32:54,430 --> 00:32:55,760
The grain from nearby villages

691
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:56,950
was taken by the Qin family

692
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:58,710
before it could even ripen.

693
00:32:59,190 --> 00:33:00,560
We small merchants

694
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:02,350
can only stand by and watch.

695
00:33:03,470 --> 00:33:04,470
It's the Qin family again.

696
00:33:17,110 --> 00:33:18,000
Yanjin!

697
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,640
I knew you would come.

698
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:22,710
Please.

699
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:26,710
What's the matter?

700
00:33:28,350 --> 00:33:29,160
Just say it.

701
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:30,710
Be patient, Yanjin.

702
00:33:30,710 --> 00:33:32,110
Let's eat and talk.

703
00:33:33,590 --> 00:33:34,590
It's been so many years.

704
00:33:34,590 --> 00:33:36,710
You've been handling everything

705
00:33:36,830 --> 00:33:38,430
for the Qi family alone.

706
00:33:39,110 --> 00:33:42,070
Isn't it time

707
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:43,950
to think about yourself?

708
00:33:45,230 --> 00:33:46,470
What am I supposed to think,

709
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:48,760
being neither legitimate nor firstborn?

710
00:33:49,350 --> 00:33:50,680
You shouldn't speak like that.

711
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:53,470
Yanjin, in terms of character,

712
00:33:53,470 --> 00:33:54,760
ability, and courage,

713
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:56,110
you surpass Menglin.

714
00:33:56,310 --> 00:33:57,800
Everyone can see that.

715
00:33:58,110 --> 00:33:59,040
Governor Qi

716
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:00,680
must be indecisive

717
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:01,920
between you and Menglin.

718
00:34:02,470 --> 00:34:04,590
Even if he leans towards Menglin,

719
00:34:05,350 --> 00:34:06,800
if you can achieve

720
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:07,710
something significant

721
00:34:07,710 --> 00:34:08,950
for the governor,

722
00:34:09,150 --> 00:34:10,840
and accomplish
something great for the Qi family,

723
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:13,040
his scale will surely

724
00:34:13,670 --> 00:34:16,280
tip in your favor.

725
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:17,630
Something significant?

726
00:34:18,230 --> 00:34:19,280
Great achievement?

727
00:34:21,670 --> 00:34:23,190
I know your favorite dish

728
00:34:23,190 --> 00:34:24,280
is crucian carp tofu soup,

729
00:34:24,670 --> 00:34:26,230
so I specially had the chef prepare it.

730
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:28,120
Please have a taste.

731
00:34:32,630 --> 00:34:33,800
Qin Yi,

732
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:35,870
you never make a loss.

733
00:34:37,390 --> 00:34:38,390
What is your motive?

734
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,150
If I say

735
00:34:44,150 --> 00:34:45,120
it's because of our friendship

736
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:46,320
over the years,

737
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:48,630
you wouldn't believe it.

738
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:50,430
I'm a businessman.

739
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:51,630
Of course,

740
00:34:51,630 --> 00:34:52,800
I have to consider profits.

741
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:55,230
But over the years,

742
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:57,080
my dealings with the Qi family

743
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:58,800
have really been

744
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,390
because of my relationship

745
00:35:00,870 --> 00:35:02,840
with you.

746
00:35:03,710 --> 00:35:04,840
However, Yanjin,

747
00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:07,950
would you take advantage of me

748
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:10,280
like the governor would?

749
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:15,520
It depends

750
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,280
on how you behave.

751
00:35:19,630 --> 00:35:20,600
I behave well.

752
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:22,520
Very well, indeed.

753
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:29,950
Yanjin, do you know

754
00:35:31,470 --> 00:35:33,320
that all the relief grain

755
00:35:33,670 --> 00:35:34,870
has already been allocated

756
00:35:35,230 --> 00:35:36,520
to Mr. Liu?

757
00:35:37,710 --> 00:35:38,630
So what?

758
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:41,230
If something goes wrong

759
00:35:41,710 --> 00:35:42,840
in this large granary,

760
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:43,840
or if there's an accident,

761
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:45,560
what do you think will happen?

762
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:48,470
With your grain stock,

763
00:35:49,630 --> 00:35:51,080
you could drive the prices even higher.

764
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:54,040
You're a profit-driven merchant.

765
00:35:55,910 --> 00:35:56,910
Exactly.

766
00:35:57,910 --> 00:35:59,320
I could definitely

767
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:00,360
make a fortune.

768
00:36:01,230 --> 00:36:02,520
But the biggest beneficiary

769
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:04,040
would be your Qi family.

770
00:36:04,390 --> 00:36:06,800
It would be you, Yanjin.

771
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:12,800
What's your clever plan?

772
00:36:13,230 --> 00:36:14,230
Burn

773
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:16,840
it all.

774
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:22,230
Burning government grain

775
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:24,760
is a capital offense.

776
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:28,360
The relief grain is overseen by Mr. Liu.

777
00:36:28,670 --> 00:36:29,760
If the granary burns,

778
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,630
Mr. Liu can't escape the blame.

779
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:36,280
I'm getting more confused.

780
00:36:37,390 --> 00:36:38,190
Aren't you already

781
00:36:38,190 --> 00:36:39,760
a guest of Mr. Liu?

782
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:41,600
Why suggest such a plan?

783
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:43,080
You flatter me, Yanjin.

784
00:36:43,230 --> 00:36:44,040
To be honest,

785
00:36:44,230 --> 00:36:46,000
I do have intentions
to get close to him.

786
00:36:46,430 --> 00:36:47,190
But unfortunately,

787
00:36:47,190 --> 00:36:48,710
Mr. Liu isn't interested
in forming alliances.

788
00:36:49,190 --> 00:36:49,950
Through this,

789
00:36:49,950 --> 00:36:51,390
I understand one thing:

790
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:52,760
in business,

791
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:54,600
it's better to deal with familiar faces
than strangers.

792
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:55,800
Over the years,

793
00:36:56,190 --> 00:36:57,870
I've had dealings with the Qi family,

794
00:36:58,080 --> 00:36:59,670
and we should unite
against a common enemy.

795
00:36:59,950 --> 00:37:00,840
If this plan succeeds,

796
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,150
I'd regain

797
00:37:02,150 --> 00:37:03,390
the protection of the Qi family.

798
00:37:03,670 --> 00:37:05,150
Yanjin, by helping the governor

799
00:37:05,150 --> 00:37:06,280
eliminate political adversaries,

800
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:07,150
you'd safeguard the Qi family

801
00:37:07,150 --> 00:37:08,710
and secure
the head of the family position.

802
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:10,520
Isn't that a win-win?

803
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:13,360
If things go wrong,

804
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:15,520
the Qi family could face ruin.

805
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:17,560
Yanjin, why worry

806
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:18,630
about gains and losses?

807
00:37:19,430 --> 00:37:21,360
Wealth and status
are often found in danger.

808
00:37:21,430 --> 00:37:22,910
As long as we plan carefully

809
00:37:22,910 --> 00:37:24,080
and act swiftly,

810
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:25,600
this matter will not be exposed.

811
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:26,910
Over the years,

Have we ever failed?

815
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:33,800
Yanjin, think it over.

816
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:35,840
If this succeeds,

817
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:38,470
you'll be the governor's top choice

818
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:40,000
in his heart.
