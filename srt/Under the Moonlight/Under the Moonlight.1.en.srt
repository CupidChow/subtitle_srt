[Episode 1]

4
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:33,470
Why don't we

5
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,800
just go back?

6
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:07,080
There's no one around

7
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:08,720
to guide us.

8
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:14,910
Look,

9
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,080
I think we should take off our shoes

10
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,080
and offer them.

11
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,670
Isn't this

12
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,830
a bit too bold?

13
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:29,390
What will we wear then?

14
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,270
It's too much

15
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:35,880
for my delicate feet.

16
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,360
We've come this far.

17
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,360
Let's just do whatever we need to do.

18
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:57,520
If I had known,
I wouldn't have worn these today.

19
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:01,360
Can I

20
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,470
take this pearl off

21
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:03,320
before offering them?

22
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:14,630
Later,

23
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,510
I'll buy you a better pair.

24
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:18,440
You said that.

25
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:19,480
I'll remember it.

26
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:27,790
Please bless my sister-in-law and me,

27
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,000
so we can bear children soon.

28
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:36,920
This way, please.

29
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,350
I'm your humble devotee.

30
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:43,880
My husband and I

31
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,790
have been married
for seven years with no children.

32
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:48,230
I hope you will show mercy

33
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:50,070
and grant us offspring.

34
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:53,200
Stop.

35
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:55,640
Kneel down.

36
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,040
Don't kneel to me.

37
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,200
Kneel to my master.

38
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,830
Where do you come from?

39
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:08,880
I'm Ding Bai from Linfen.

40
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:11,320
This is my sister-in-law, Li Ding.

41
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:12,550
Ding?

42
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,440
You're from the renowned Ding family?

43
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:17,950
You know my family?

44
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,600
You may offer as you wish.

45
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:29,830
But I don't have

46
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:31,000
much money on me.

47
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,720
There are more offerings
than just money.

48
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,920
My master
compassionately grants children.

49
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:03,070
He doesn't
care for these worldly possessions.

50
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:05,510
It's just to test if you are sincere.

51
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:08,040
Those without sincerity
have little connection with him

52
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:09,790
and even less with offspring.

53
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:10,920
You may leave.

54
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,160
Please don't be angry.

55
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,200
Right now,

56
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,480
we only have him to rely on.

57
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,230
If we can have a son,

58
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,040
we will offer everything we have

59
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:29,760
to him.

60
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:33,390
Please come in.

61
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:48,830
Nice to meet you.

62
00:06:58,390 --> 00:07:00,880
What troubles do you have?

63
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:02,830
Well,

64
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,440
my husband and I
have been married for three years.

65
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,040
We are deeply in love

66
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:09,830
but still have no children.

67
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:11,920
My sister-in-law

68
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:13,640
has been married for five years.

69
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:16,110
She has seen countless doctors in Linfen

70
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:17,550
and taken

71
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:18,920
many expensive medicines.

72
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:20,550
Yet her belly

73
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,510
shows no sign of life.

74
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,110
We are at our wits' end.

75
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:25,950
Please show mercy

76
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,440
and grant us children.

77
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:07,600
Ladies,

78
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:09,160
the black one is Qirong Pill,

79
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,110
and the golden one is Zhongzi Pill.

80
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:13,510
Take the Qirong Pill before bed

81
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:14,830
and the Zhongzi Pill

82
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:16,350
tomorrow morning.

83
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:18,320
My master will bless you both.

84
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:20,270
Thank you for your guidance.

85
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:22,350
Please return to your room
and pray sincerely.

86
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:24,200
Make sure to sleep before Hai hour.

87
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,760
Otherwise, the magic will fail,

88
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:26,830
and you won't have a child.

89
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:08,280
Why don't you pray in your room?

90
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:10,470
What are you doing here?

91
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:12,640
Greetings.

92
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:16,880
I came to worship the kylin.

93
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,790
I passed by earlier

94
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,960
and saw this majestic kylin.

95
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:23,230
Since this place is sacred,

96
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,350
the kylin here must be blessed.

97
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,200
So I wanted to pay my respects.

98
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:41,960
Sorry to disturb you.

99
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:43,320
I'll go back now.

100
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,440
Bad news, Brother!

101
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,320
Brother!

102
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,640
Calm down.

103
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:51,880
Aren't you going to serve the meal?

104
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:52,840
Why are you just standing there?

105
00:09:55,670 --> 00:09:56,150
Yes.

106
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,110
I'll walk you back to your room.

107
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:03,640
Thank you.

108
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:16,960
This is your room?

109
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:16,760
Master?

110
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,030
You haven't taken your medicine?

111
00:11:18,590 --> 00:11:19,400
I took it,

112
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,400
but felt nauseous and vomited.

113
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,280
It doesn't matter.

114
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:32,910
Who the hell are you?

115
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,150
I'm Ding...

116
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:34,910
Nonsense.

117
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:35,710
You came to offer incense.

118
00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:36,840
Why are you wearing shrouded clothing?

119
00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:40,960
Do you know something?

120
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:42,760
No, I don't.

121
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:44,520
You've been acting suspiciously
during the day.

122
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:45,110
Tell me.

123
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:46,320
What is your intention?

124
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:49,440
I am indeed a woman of the Ding family,

125
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,030
just not Mrs. Ding.

126
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,520
Then why are you
dressed in shrouded clothing?

127
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:56,670
It's not me who sewed it.

128
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,710
Mrs. Ding had it sewn.

129
00:11:58,760 --> 00:11:59,760
Mrs. Ding?

130
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:00,640
Why did she

131
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:01,880
have you wear shrouded clothing?

132
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:02,470
Tell me.

133
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,110
She sent me to scout,

134
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:06,200
afraid I wouldn't report truthfully,

135
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:07,840
so she had my clothes

136
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:09,030
sewn together.

137
00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:10,880
If I return

138
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,320
with my clothes intact,

139
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,080
it proves everything here is fine.

140
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,080
In that case,

141
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:17,790
you can stay here

142
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,520
and be my partner.

143
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,150
It hurts.

144
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:28,790
You...

145
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,080
It's Mrs. Ding.

146
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:39,790
She beats me every day.

147
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:42,640
Living in the Ding family,

148
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:44,910
every day feels like a year.

149
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:46,670
It's truly tormenting.

150
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:55,150
You look like an extraordinary man.

151
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,590
Please, help me.

152
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,110
Why should I help you?

153
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:27,000
Please, just let me go.

154
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,960
Don't you want a child?

155
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,030
I am here to give you one.

156
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:32,320
No!

157
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:33,910
Don't come near me!

158
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:37,840
What does this mean?

159
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:41,470
If you can help me,

160
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:42,910
this is a down payment.

161
00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:48,150
How can I help you?

162
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:53,440
Mr. Ding can no longer have children.

163
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:55,080
He knows this himself.

164
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:57,470
But Mrs. Ding still holds onto hope.

165
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,110
I manage her prescriptions.

166
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,910
Only I know this secret.

167
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:04,400
Tomorrow, I'll lure her here,

168
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:05,910
and you can deal with her then.

169
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:07,550
Once she is pregnant,

170
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:09,470
I can overthrow her

171
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,320
and take her place.

172
00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:12,960
The Ding family has no heirs.

173
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,590
When that old man

174
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:17,080
passes away in a year or so,

175
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,230
his fortune

176
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:19,470
will belong to me.

177
00:14:19,710 --> 00:14:22,230
Then, you can come down.

178
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,590
We can be together forever.

179
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:32,150
Why should I trust you?

180
00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:35,440
I'll give you an IOU.

181
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:37,280
Once it's done,

182
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:39,080
if you don't want to stay there,

183
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:40,710
just come to me with the IOU.

184
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:43,110
I will give you 500 liang of gold.

185
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,520
That's a pretty good idea.

186
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:18,880
Better than following that old man,

187
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,080
playing tricks.

188
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,710
Isn't your master all-powerful?

189
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:25,710
When I came here,

190
00:15:25,710 --> 00:15:27,110
I heard many people say

191
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,760
he is the real deity of childbearing.

192
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,280
All-powerful?

193
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:31,670
It's us,

194
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:33,280
his robust disciples.

195
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,910
We're all just deceiving women like you.

196
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:37,550
He just sits on his pedestal,

197
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:38,440
collecting donations.

198
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:39,080
Otherwise,

199
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,470
with that old body of his,

200
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:42,030
how could he do it?

201
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:44,640
He'd be delivering death.

202
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,400
So you're saying

203
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:49,880
the ones taking risks

204
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:51,470
are you disciples,

205
00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:53,470
while all the money
goes into his pockets?

206
00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:55,230
He's just an old miser,

207
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:57,440
guarding wealth like a dragon.

208
00:15:57,590 --> 00:15:59,400
Never parting with it, even in sleep.

209
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:11,840
Bring everyone in this place

210
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:12,790
to me,

211
00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:13,590
including your master.

212
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:14,550
And

213
00:16:14,590 --> 00:16:15,520
the records too.

214
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,640
Who are you?

215
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:25,200
My master is...!

216
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:27,910
You...!

217
00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:30,520
Will you do it

218
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:32,710
or not?

219
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:33,880
Yes, I will.

220
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:35,150
I will.

221
00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:38,200
Wait there!

222
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:43,760
It's them.

223
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:54,590
Why didn't you greet the official?

224
00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:57,840
Outsiders do not observe
worldly etiquette.

225
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:00,350
I commanded you to gather all disciples.

226
00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:03,590
Why are there only so few of you?

227
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:05,400
All the disciples
are in quiet meditation,

228
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,590
and cannot be disturbed.

229
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:07,710
Sir,

230
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:09,950
if you need something,

231
00:17:10,190 --> 00:17:11,760
just tell me.

232
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,040
As the deputy magistrate,

233
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:20,520
I cannot see your men?

234
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:26,310
Outsiders do not
care for worldly status.

235
00:17:26,430 --> 00:17:28,310
I hope you won't blame me.

236
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:33,430
What a good excuse for everything!

237
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,040
Your Honor.

238
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,070
Your Honor.

239
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:45,040
Greetings, Your Honor.

240
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:52,640
You have half a quarter of an hour

241
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:54,520
to gather everyone

242
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:55,560
in this place.

243
00:17:56,470 --> 00:17:57,280
Sir,

244
00:17:58,190 --> 00:17:59,430
my disciples and I

245
00:17:59,430 --> 00:18:01,000
have no idea what we did wrong

246
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:03,640
that you would come here at midnight

247
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:05,680
with weapons drawn.

248
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:08,880
I am truly wronged.

249
00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:10,310
Whether you are wronged or not,

250
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:12,350
I will find out the truth.

251
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,000
Now, call everyone over.

252
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:15,760
Do you want the constables

253
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:16,640
to do it themselves?

254
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:23,710
No.

255
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:37,800
Please, Your Honor.

256
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,040
Just ten days into your term,

257
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:49,350
and you come to stir up trouble.

258
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:06,800
I have 20 disciples under me,

259
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,710
and they are all here.

260
00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:36,190
Strip off your upper garments.

261
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:41,830
Do you hear him?

262
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:44,520
Take them off!
Not a single piece can stay.

263
00:19:46,430 --> 00:19:47,190
Are you alright?

264
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:50,070
Yes, I am.

265
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,400
How dare take advantage of me?

266
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:01,590
Shameless!

267
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:12,710
You!

268
00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:14,590
And you!

269
00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:17,000
Stand up!

270
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:26,520
About the rouge marks on both of you,

271
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:27,520
what do you have to say?

272
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:34,680
Sir,

273
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:37,640
we were just playing around
and drew on each other.

274
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:39,110
He's lying!

275
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,830
Please help me, Your Honor.

276
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:55,190
What exactly happened?

277
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,040
Tell me everything.

278
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Your Honor,

279
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,190
I was staying in my room.

280
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:03,760
In the middle of the night,

281
00:21:04,590 --> 00:21:06,000
he came in from the secret passage,

282
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:07,520
trying to commit an assault.

283
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:08,830
As a weak woman,

284
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:09,950
I had no power to resist.

285
00:21:10,190 --> 00:21:11,430
I could only quietly leave rouge marks

286
00:21:11,430 --> 00:21:12,110
on his shoulders

287
00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:14,400
and back as evidence.

288
00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:23,560
He was so pleased with himself

289
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:24,760
that he revealed

290
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:25,710
all the dirty dealings

291
00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:26,950
in this place.

292
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,310
You are lying!

293
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,350
When did I have an affair with you?

294
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,800
Sir, if you don't believe me,

295
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:33,880
you can check her.

296
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:35,640
She has sewn her inner garment tightly.

297
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,400
If you never touched me,

298
00:21:38,470 --> 00:21:39,160
how would you know

299
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,520
my inner garment is sewn tightly?

300
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:53,110
What a misfortune!

301
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:55,560
Bai Yue!

302
00:21:55,950 --> 00:21:57,040
How could you do

303
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:58,230
such a disgraceful thing?

304
00:21:58,230 --> 00:21:59,710
I'm so disappointed.

305
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:01,680
Do you realize your mistake?

306
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,920
Yes, it was a moment of folly.

307
00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:09,470
You're stupid!

308
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:11,880
So stupid!

309
00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:14,160
Sir,

310
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:17,230
it has nothing to do with the others.

311
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:20,350
This is
all the doing of this one man,

312
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:21,070
then...

313
00:22:22,310 --> 00:22:23,710
Sir, just take him back

314
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:24,950
and deal with him as you wish.

315
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:26,950
Is he the only one?

316
00:22:27,950 --> 00:22:28,710
What about him?

317
00:22:29,310 --> 00:22:31,230
Right! This man, too!

318
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:33,310
He sneaked into my room

319
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:34,830
to commit improper acts.

320
00:22:35,110 --> 00:22:36,680
Is he unrelated to the others as well?

321
00:22:39,710 --> 00:22:40,880
Your Honor,

322
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:42,640
if it were just one man,

323
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:44,070
it could be considered an isolated case.

324
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:46,190
But now, two of them are like this.

325
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:47,760
It shows that this place

326
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:49,470
is likely a den of iniquity.

327
00:22:50,190 --> 00:22:51,760
Assaulting virtuous women
is no small matter.

328
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:52,400
Your Honor,

329
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,920
we should take all the offenders

330
00:22:53,950 --> 00:22:55,350
back to the yamen.

331
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:56,760
They are not

332
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:57,590
virtuous women.

333
00:22:58,110 --> 00:22:59,470
They are courtesans from Mingke House.

334
00:23:00,590 --> 00:23:02,560
Her name is Jin Nang.

335
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:04,280
She's a well-known courtesan.

336
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:05,520
And she is

337
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,160
one of the Six Beauties of Mingke.

338
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:13,880
I really didn't expect that.

339
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,590
You self-proclaimed pure ones,

340
00:23:16,590 --> 00:23:17,800
outsiders,

341
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,800
also enjoy visiting Mingke House?

342
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:20,830
Indeed!

343
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:23,400
Perhaps you are regulars there?

344
00:23:27,590 --> 00:23:28,400
Sir,

345
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,230
my disciples

346
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:33,560
are usually well-behaved.

347
00:23:33,950 --> 00:23:35,800
It's just that today

348
00:23:36,310 --> 00:23:37,350
two rascals appeared,

349
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:39,190
damaging the reputation of my place.

350
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:42,070
Fortunately,

351
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:43,680
with your keen insight,

352
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:45,400
you swiftly exposed them.

353
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:49,040
But the other disciples and I

354
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,040
are truly innocent.

355
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:56,160
These two ladies

356
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,950
are courtesans from Mingke House,

357
00:23:57,950 --> 00:24:00,040
so it wouldn't harm their reputation.

358
00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:03,190
I earnestly request you, Sir,

359
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:04,680
to show mercy

360
00:24:05,190 --> 00:24:06,000
and help me

361
00:24:07,430 --> 00:24:08,830
cover this disgrace.

362
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:11,280
This disgrace cannot be hidden.

363
00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:14,920
Your Honor,

364
00:24:15,190 --> 00:24:15,800
just now,

365
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:17,520
this pretentious sorcerer said

366
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,040
there are only these two rascals.

367
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:20,590
But if you like,

368
00:24:20,590 --> 00:24:21,920
you can thoroughly search this place

369
00:24:22,310 --> 00:24:23,000
and see how many secret passages

370
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,230
are hidden inside.

371
00:24:26,350 --> 00:24:28,560
No, there are no more.

372
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,000
Search!

373
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:30,680
Yes.

374
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:53,000
My goodness!

375
00:24:57,350 --> 00:24:58,040
Your Honor,

376
00:24:58,040 --> 00:24:59,110
behind all wardrobes in the rooms,

377
00:24:59,110 --> 00:24:59,760
there are secret passages

378
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,110
leading to the side yard.

379
00:25:02,350 --> 00:25:03,400
What else do you have to say?

380
00:25:05,310 --> 00:25:06,110
Sir,

381
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:07,800
actually,

382
00:25:08,470 --> 00:25:10,110
this place

383
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:12,230
was rented by me

384
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:14,560
to be used as an incense hall.

385
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:17,190
As for those secret passages,

386
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,230
they might have been left
by previous owners.

387
00:25:20,230 --> 00:25:22,190
We knew nothing about them.

388
00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:24,590
These two must have

389
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:26,920
discovered this secret

390
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:28,000
by chance

391
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,590
and acted improperly.

392
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,110
The other disciples and I

393
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:35,070
really had no idea about this at all.

394
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:38,680
If he insists

395
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:39,880
that the passages
have nothing to do with him,

396
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:41,400
it cannot be definitively concluded.

397
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:42,430
This matter must be handled

398
00:25:42,470 --> 00:25:44,160
without any flaws.

399
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:45,590
Your Honor,

400
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:47,590
it would be best to call in the women

401
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:48,560
who stayed here and ask them.

402
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:50,280
Mr. Chen,

403
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,190
may I approach to speak?

404
00:25:52,230 --> 00:25:53,710
Is there anything
that cannot be said openly?

405
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:00,710
Go ahead.

406
00:26:07,070 --> 00:26:08,280
Please, show mercy

407
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:10,040
and spare those women.

408
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:11,400
What nonsense are you talking?

409
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,110
Do you still remember

410
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:15,640
how you first obtained

411
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:16,950
those clues

412
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:19,680
and why you asked us

413
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:21,160
to act as informants?

414
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:24,880
That woman was repeatedly

415
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:25,880
extorted for money by them

416
00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:27,680
and didn't dare to tell her husband.

417
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:29,310
She was truly at her wit's end

418
00:26:29,310 --> 00:26:30,520
and jumped into the river
to end her life.

419
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:32,040
Someone jumped into the river.

420
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,000
She was rescued by a passing constable,

421
00:26:35,110 --> 00:26:36,190
and that's how you learned

422
00:26:36,190 --> 00:26:37,160
the secrets of this place.

423
00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:39,280
Because past victims

424
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:40,230
were unwilling to admit

425
00:26:40,230 --> 00:26:41,310
that there were problems
with this place.

426
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:44,760
For women,

427
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:46,350
their virtue is their lifeline.

428
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:48,280
To lose that is to lose their lives.

429
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,470
If this disgrace is concealed,

430
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,160
they might still survive.

431
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:54,160
But if they're forced to speak out

432
00:26:54,590 --> 00:26:55,920
or even testify in court...

433
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:57,310
Your Honor,

434
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,400
you wouldn't want to
have more innocent souls

435
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,760
suffering under your rule, would you?

436
00:27:01,470 --> 00:27:02,680
Your Honor,

437
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:03,640
if you're going to act,

438
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:04,800
you must ensure

439
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:05,880
complete victory.

440
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:06,880
This is a battle to establish authority,

441
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:07,680
which will impact

442
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:09,470
your future control over Linfen.

443
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:10,710
Mr. Chen,

444
00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:12,590
solving this case
doesn't necessarily require

445
00:27:12,590 --> 00:27:14,040
the women's testimonies.

446
00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:16,560
You got a plan?

447
00:27:28,430 --> 00:27:29,070
Search it.

448
00:27:29,070 --> 00:27:29,560
Yes.

449
00:27:49,430 --> 00:27:51,160
He's just an old miser,

450
00:27:51,430 --> 00:27:53,430
guarding wealth like a dragon.

451
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:55,190
Never parting with it, even in sleep.

452
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:19,110
Tear it down!

453
00:28:19,110 --> 00:28:19,920
Yes.

454
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:33,800
You said the passages
were left by previous owners,

455
00:28:33,950 --> 00:28:35,000
and you knew nothing about them.

456
00:28:35,310 --> 00:28:37,000
What about all this gold,
silver and jewelry?

457
00:28:38,350 --> 00:28:40,070
You knew nothing about it, either?

458
00:28:40,310 --> 00:28:41,070
I...

459
00:28:41,070 --> 00:28:43,000
Confiscate everything and take them away!

460
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:43,640
Yes.

461
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:44,310
Stop!

462
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:49,350
Is it your property?

463
00:28:51,310 --> 00:28:54,110
Yes, it is.

464
00:28:54,110 --> 00:28:55,110
However,

465
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:58,040
all offerings were
willingly given by the patrons.

466
00:28:58,040 --> 00:28:59,310
So you are not completely ignorant

467
00:28:59,310 --> 00:29:01,000
of the secret passages.

468
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:01,950
Sir,

469
00:29:02,310 --> 00:29:03,760
I have already said,

470
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:04,880
those passages

471
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,920
were likely left by previous owners.

472
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:09,000
We didn't know anything about them.

473
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:12,680
So your disciple was not mistaken.

474
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:14,640
You really are

475
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:16,190
a greedy miser,

476
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:17,830
keeping all the gold and silver

477
00:29:17,830 --> 00:29:19,110
for yourself,

478
00:29:19,110 --> 00:29:20,710
even watching over it while you sleep.

479
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:21,830
What a pity

480
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:24,040
that your disciples

481
00:29:24,310 --> 00:29:26,350
can not get a single coin.

482
00:29:27,470 --> 00:29:28,400
So much wealth,

483
00:29:29,070 --> 00:29:29,950
for such a long time,

484
00:29:29,950 --> 00:29:31,310
and we didn't get any of it.

485
00:29:31,310 --> 00:29:32,230
So much money,

486
00:29:32,710 --> 00:29:33,920
and we knew nothing.

487
00:29:35,070 --> 00:29:35,880
Your Honor,

488
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:37,110
I saw what happened

489
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:38,430
during the day.

490
00:29:38,590 --> 00:29:40,190
Those women's offerings

491
00:29:40,190 --> 00:29:41,880
are merely the jewelry they carry.

492
00:29:42,310 --> 00:29:44,110
To accumulate so much gold and silver,

493
00:29:44,110 --> 00:29:45,110
it would take at least

494
00:29:45,110 --> 00:29:46,190
ten or twenty years.

495
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:47,800
Furthermore, in these boxes,

496
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:48,950
there are numerous land deeds.

497
00:29:49,310 --> 00:29:50,280
Who would bring deeds

498
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:51,760
to pray for children?

499
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:53,710
It must be that they

500
00:29:53,710 --> 00:29:55,110
have violated those women,

501
00:29:55,350 --> 00:29:57,040
causing them to conceive and give birth,

502
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:58,400
and then blackmailing them

503
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,470
for money.

504
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:01,830
It must be an easy job for them.

505
00:30:02,470 --> 00:30:03,110
Your Honor, you might as well

506
00:30:03,110 --> 00:30:04,710
bring them back to the yamen,

507
00:30:04,710 --> 00:30:05,350
and in the prison,

508
00:30:05,350 --> 00:30:06,520
have a good talk with them.

509
00:30:07,110 --> 00:30:07,920
I'm sure

510
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:10,310
you'll uncover many stories.

511
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:12,190
What a wicked woman you are!

512
00:30:12,190 --> 00:30:13,560
Tie them all up

513
00:30:13,950 --> 00:30:15,110
and take them back to the yamen.

514
00:30:15,110 --> 00:30:15,710
Yes.

515
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:18,920
What are you doing?

516
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:19,830
Be quiet!

517
00:30:20,350 --> 00:30:21,040
Why are you binding me?

518
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:22,160
On what basis?

519
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:22,590
Get up!

520
00:30:23,590 --> 00:30:24,160
Why are you binding me?

521
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:26,400
On what basis?

522
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:28,640
Get up quickly!

523
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:29,230
What are you doing?

524
00:30:30,350 --> 00:30:30,680
Get up!

525
00:30:35,590 --> 00:30:36,070
Lady!

526
00:30:57,350 --> 00:30:58,710
You finally woke up!

527
00:30:59,350 --> 00:31:01,230
How are you feeling?
Still uncomfortable?

528
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:03,230
Do you have a headache?
Is your chest tight?

529
00:31:04,950 --> 00:31:06,430
What happened to you?

530
00:31:06,590 --> 00:31:07,520
Why did you

531
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:08,950
suddenly faint?

532
00:31:10,430 --> 00:31:11,830
What time is it now?

533
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,400
It's already Mao hour.

534
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:14,680
Because you fainted,

535
00:31:14,710 --> 00:31:15,680
the magistrate didn't allow everyone

536
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:16,880
to leave the mountain immediately.

537
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:17,680
He insisted

538
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:19,520
that a patient
shouldn't be moved or jostled,

539
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:20,880
so we had to wait for you to wake up.

540
00:31:22,830 --> 00:31:24,920
He's got a crush on you, hasn't he?

541
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:27,000
Don't talk nonsense!

542
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:32,760
These prisoners must be accounted for.

543
00:31:36,830 --> 00:31:37,760
They're...

544
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:47,160
While you were unconscious,

545
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:47,640
I ran back

546
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:49,040
and got our shoes.

547
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,070
But you promised me

548
00:31:51,430 --> 00:31:53,040
that you would give me a better pair.

549
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:54,230
That promise must be kept.

550
00:31:55,710 --> 00:31:56,920
Oh you, really!

551
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:06,800
You're awake.

552
00:32:09,310 --> 00:32:10,160
Are you alright?

553
00:32:13,430 --> 00:32:14,760
Thank you for your concern.

554
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:16,000
I am fine now.

555
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:18,310
That's good to hear.

556
00:32:20,710 --> 00:32:22,230
Let's set out down the mountain.

557
00:32:34,950 --> 00:32:35,950
You know what?

558
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:37,230
Coming out with you

559
00:32:37,230 --> 00:32:39,190
really allows me to see the big world.

560
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:40,230
Before this,

561
00:32:40,230 --> 00:32:41,950
I was cooped up in Mingke House,

562
00:32:42,110 --> 00:32:43,680
not knowing that there were

563
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:44,470
so many exciting

564
00:32:44,470 --> 00:32:46,310
and thrilling things in the world.

565
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:49,430
It's too early to be happy.

566
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:50,950
This matter may not be over yet.

567
00:33:08,430 --> 00:33:09,000
Protect the magistrate!

568
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:58,400
Stop!

569
00:34:00,230 --> 00:34:01,800
You have the guts
to kill officials and revolt?

570
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:07,830
No.

571
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,390
I just hope

572
00:34:10,390 --> 00:34:11,520
you can let us go.

573
00:34:12,470 --> 00:34:13,600
As the saying goes,

574
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,560
cats have their way
and mice have theirs.

575
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:17,600
If you can

576
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:19,710
let us leave

577
00:34:20,230 --> 00:34:22,870
and stop messing with us,

578
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:25,910
we'll forget what happened today.

579
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:28,800
I won't cause you

580
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,040
any trouble in the future.

581
00:34:32,230 --> 00:34:33,520
What if I refuse?

582
00:34:33,630 --> 00:34:35,840
You refuse, right?

583
00:34:36,150 --> 00:34:36,950
Then today,

584
00:34:36,950 --> 00:34:39,190
you won't leave here alive.

585
00:34:40,390 --> 00:34:41,360
Everyone, go!

586
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:11,360
You pretended to faint,

587
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:12,950
deliberately wasting time.

588
00:35:12,950 --> 00:35:15,190
That's right. I was faking it.

589
00:35:15,630 --> 00:35:17,120
But you didn't disappoint me either,

590
00:35:17,230 --> 00:35:18,080
did you?

591
00:35:18,150 --> 00:35:19,320
Tie them all up

592
00:35:19,910 --> 00:35:20,950
and take them back to the yamen.

593
00:35:22,870 --> 00:35:23,360
Be quiet!

594
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:24,390
Why are you binding me?

595
00:35:24,390 --> 00:35:25,120
Be quiet!

596
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:25,760
Why are you binding me?

597
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:26,470
Be quiet!

598
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:38,320
Lady!

599
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:40,280
They have accomplices.
Be careful of ambush.

600
00:35:44,950 --> 00:35:45,950
You go down the mountain first.

601
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:47,320
Find Pingyangwei for reinforcements.

602
00:35:52,230 --> 00:35:53,390
Surrender!

603
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:55,120
You can't escape!

604
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:57,040
You want to keep us here?

605
00:35:58,390 --> 00:35:59,230
Guys,

606
00:35:59,630 --> 00:36:01,600
you are all men of blood!

607
00:36:01,670 --> 00:36:03,630
Fight them to the death!

608
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:04,710
Kill one to break even.

609
00:36:04,710 --> 00:36:05,870
Kill two and you won't lose out.

610
00:36:06,190 --> 00:36:06,870
Go!

611
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:15,360
You are really clever.

612
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,560
You never share your wealth
with your disciples,

613
00:36:17,710 --> 00:36:19,520
but want them to die for you.

614
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:21,560
Do you think
they'll be sentenced to death

615
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:22,390
like you?

616
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,430
They aren't the main culprits.

617
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,000
They were just following your orders,

618
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,360
deceived by you.

619
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:28,630
If they are taken to the yamen,

620
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:30,870
they'll just get a beating
and be released.

621
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:32,230
I can see

622
00:36:32,390 --> 00:36:34,080
you're just using them

623
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:35,800
and making them fight for you,

624
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:37,150
so you can take advantage of the chaos
and run away.

625
00:36:39,150 --> 00:36:39,430
You!

626
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:40,150
Bastard!

627
00:36:40,150 --> 00:36:40,950
Step back!

628
00:36:41,910 --> 00:36:43,390
Bastard, let her go!

629
00:36:43,390 --> 00:36:45,600
Step back! All of you!

630
00:36:46,670 --> 00:36:47,630
Don't come closer.

631
00:36:48,150 --> 00:36:49,630
Or I'll kill her!

632
00:36:49,630 --> 00:36:50,390
Fire.

633
00:36:50,390 --> 00:36:51,190
Wait!

634
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:54,600
Let her go.

635
00:36:55,230 --> 00:36:56,280
I'll be your hostage.

636
00:37:03,190 --> 00:37:04,600
Compared to her life,

637
00:37:04,870 --> 00:37:06,840
mine is worth more.

638
00:37:07,390 --> 00:37:08,120
Alright then,

639
00:37:08,910 --> 00:37:10,120
come over here.

640
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:13,000
Don't try any tricks.

641
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:14,560
Come here!

642
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:16,150
Come!

643
00:37:23,190 --> 00:37:23,910
Fire!

644
00:37:26,390 --> 00:37:28,080
Run!

645
00:37:29,710 --> 00:37:30,470
Stop!

646
00:37:49,630 --> 00:37:50,280
Captain Cai.

647
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:50,630
Yes?

648
00:37:50,630 --> 00:37:51,430
Put them in prison.

649
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:52,120
Let's go.

650
00:38:03,630 --> 00:38:04,520
This is the money

651
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:06,040
promised to you.

652
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:16,600
Not enough?

653
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,560
Thank you for your support.

654
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:26,190
Your Honor,

655
00:38:29,430 --> 00:38:30,710
I don't want the money.

656
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:32,910
I merely ask
that you fulfill your promise.

657
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:34,360
If we could solve this case,

658
00:38:34,670 --> 00:38:36,280
you promised me one request.

659
00:38:36,710 --> 00:38:38,230
I wonder if your words

660
00:38:38,470 --> 00:38:39,560
still stand.

661
00:38:40,670 --> 00:38:41,280
How dare you!

662
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:44,800
Since I have promised,
I will keep my word.

663
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:48,230
Please, Your Honor,

664
00:38:48,230 --> 00:38:49,840
help us

665
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:51,520
escape from this suffering,

666
00:38:51,710 --> 00:38:53,150
and restore our freedom.

667
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:56,800
You want to leave this lifestyle?

668
00:38:58,390 --> 00:38:58,950
Yes.

669
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:04,180
[A Day Ago]

670
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:02,120
You look amazing.

671
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:06,430
Madam, I'm not ready yet.

672
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:08,150
You don't need to do anything.

673
00:40:08,150 --> 00:40:10,430
I've prepared everything for you.

674
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:11,910
For your deflowering night,

675
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:12,870
I've spent

676
00:40:12,870 --> 00:40:14,800
all my savings.

677
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:16,870
Look at this wedding dress.

678
00:40:16,870 --> 00:40:17,870
It's made

679
00:40:17,870 --> 00:40:20,470
of the finest silk satin from Suzhou.

680
00:40:21,390 --> 00:40:22,470
And this

681
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:24,000
goldwork embroidery,

682
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:26,800
it took a lot of effort.

683
00:40:27,470 --> 00:40:28,600
Every girl's deflowering night here

684
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:29,120
is done

685
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:30,910
with such a wedding dress.

686
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,600
It's so nice of you, Madam.

687
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:35,870
Even if I'm not deflowered,

688
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:37,910
I can still earn much money for you.

689
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:39,080
Why are you so anxious

690
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:40,560
to have me deflowered?

691
00:40:41,470 --> 00:40:43,190
Why am I so anxious?

692
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:44,800
Because you're already 18.

693
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,360
At this age,
you're as beautiful as a flower,

694
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:47,800
but it can all be gone in a blink.

695
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,710
When you grow old and unattractive,

696
00:40:49,710 --> 00:40:52,230
who will want to hear you play and sing?

697
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:54,840
At least let's wait a couple of days,

698
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:56,800
so I can be better prepared.

699
00:40:58,230 --> 00:40:59,910
Are you preparing
for your deflowering night

700
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:01,560
or something else?

701
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:06,710
My girl,

702
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:08,120
with me here,

703
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:10,430
you don't need to prepare anything.

704
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:11,870
I promise

705
00:41:11,870 --> 00:41:14,190
you'll outshine everyone today,

706
00:41:14,190 --> 00:41:15,760
and become famous in Linfen.

707
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:17,760
Other girls are begging me,

708
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:18,560
and I won't

709
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:20,120
give them such a grand event.

710
00:41:20,630 --> 00:41:21,430
But...

711
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:22,710
No buts.

712
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,230
This matter is already settled.

713
00:41:24,230 --> 00:41:26,120
I've sent out the invitations.

714
00:41:26,230 --> 00:41:27,560
There's no negotiation.

715
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:31,520
Alright.

716
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:33,390
Don't be angry, Madam.

717
00:41:33,870 --> 00:41:35,080
I'll do

718
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:35,950
as you say.

719
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:40,190
Come on, put on the wedding dress,

720
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:42,600
so that all of Linfen can see

721
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:44,360
how beautiful

722
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:45,600
my girl is.

723
00:41:48,430 --> 00:41:50,150
Young Master, we should leave.

724
00:41:50,150 --> 00:41:50,910
If Master finds out

725
00:41:50,910 --> 00:41:51,470
you came here,

726
00:41:51,470 --> 00:41:52,800
he might break your legs.

727
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:55,080
If you don't say anything,
who will know?

728
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:56,840
But it's improper.

729
00:41:57,150 --> 00:41:58,120
What do you know?

730
00:41:58,190 --> 00:41:59,520
What do the stories say?

731
00:41:59,670 --> 00:42:02,190
It's all about talented gentlemen
and beautiful ladies.

732
00:42:02,430 --> 00:42:03,000
Look!

733
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:04,430
This is true elegance.

734
00:42:05,190 --> 00:42:05,870
No wonder

735
00:42:05,870 --> 00:42:07,430
she's the star of Mingke House.

736
00:42:07,670 --> 00:42:09,710
Such a grand occasion
for her deflowering night.

737
00:42:09,950 --> 00:42:12,320
Jin Nang is a charming girl.

738
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:13,150
Why does she wait

739
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:14,800
until 18 to have her deflowering night.

740
00:42:46,870 --> 00:42:47,670
Interesting.

741
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:53,080
Not "Autumn Moon Over the Han Palace,"

742
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:54,390
nor "Flute and Drum at Sunset,"

743
00:42:55,670 --> 00:42:57,230
but "Chu-Han" instead.
