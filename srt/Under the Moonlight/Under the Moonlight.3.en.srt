[Adapted from the novel "Jin Nang" by Shui He]

00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:33,020
[Episode 3]

4
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:56,230
Please forgive me, Mr. Qi.

5
00:01:56,590 --> 00:01:58,550
I was just acting
in accordance with the law.

6
00:01:58,630 --> 00:01:59,550
I hope you won't hold it against me.

7
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:01,230
I made mistakes too.

8
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:01,680
I didn't know

9
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,360
that you had Jin Nang handling the case.

10
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,310
In my haste, I acted rashly.

11
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:06,800
It was all a misunderstanding.

12
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,240
Yes, just a misunderstanding.

13
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:10,270
As the saying goes,
"No fight, no friendship."

14
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:12,240
Mr. Qi, cheers.

15
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,160
Cheers!

16
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,270
This is delicious!

17
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,800
How did you determine

18
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:24,550
my identity?

19
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:25,830
I sent a letter to Governor Qi,

20
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:26,910
inquiring about it.

21
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:30,000
So,

22
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:31,670
they know

23
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:32,720
I'm in Linfen now?

24
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,550
Did he

25
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:35,550
ask you to capture me?

26
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:36,550
This isn't a trap, is it?

27
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:38,110
Don't worry.

28
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,000
Your father said

29
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:39,910
that traveling

30
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:41,470
and seeing the world is not a bad thing.

31
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:43,240
He just asked us to look after you.

32
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,550
He didn't want you to return.

33
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:47,630
Great, that's good to hear.

34
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:51,080
Mr. Qi,

35
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:52,190
you really

36
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:53,800
snuck out of your home?

37
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:00,630
I'm not afraid of you
laughing at me anyway.

38
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:04,000
As a man,

39
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:05,520
I was raised

40
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,720
in a secluded estate.

41
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,440
I hardly ever stepped outside.

42
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:09,390
Most days,

43
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:12,470
I could only read novels and stories

44
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:13,320
to broaden my horizons.

45
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,240
However,

46
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,880
the world depicted in those stories

47
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:23,470
is where I truly long to be.

48
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:27,080
Mr. Qi, you are truly a man of passion.

49
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,360
Mr. Qi, would you like

50
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:32,750
to eat anything else?

51
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,270
This pork knuckle is great.

52
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:35,630
I'll have the kitchen
prepare another one.

53
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:36,320
Sounds good!

54
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:48,360
Your Honor.

55
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:49,830
He is entertaining a guest.

56
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:51,270
Let's discuss official matters later.

57
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:51,910
Understood.

58
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,030
Wait!

59
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:02,550
Oh,

60
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:04,550
you

61
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,110
sissy!

62
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,270
Come on, Han.

63
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:16,880
Tell him

64
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:20,000
who my father is.

65
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:24,110
His father is Governor Qi.

66
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,790
Open your eyes and see clearly.

67
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:28,270
When have I ever deceived you?

68
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:32,040
Mr. Qi,
I'm sorry for the offense that day.

69
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:33,510
I sincerely apologize.

70
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:34,160
Please forgive me.

71
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,070
I can't forgive you.

72
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:39,950
I don't think I ever provoked you.

73
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:41,480
Why did you tease me?

74
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:46,880
Han, and Chen,

75
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:48,950
didn't you say

76
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:51,110
if I travel in Linfen,

77
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:53,200
you would be willing to help me?

78
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:55,270
Yes.

79
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,350
So I need

80
00:04:57,350 --> 00:04:59,160
a local guide in Linfen, right?

81
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:01,670
I think

82
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:05,110
I'll take him.

83
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:07,880
Mr. Qi,

84
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:10,350
I don't think...

85
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:10,920
Your Honor,

86
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,320
I am willing to serve Mr. Qi.

87
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,270
Good, very good.

88
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:20,950
Tomorrow morning,

89
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:24,390
be sure to wait for me at my door.

90
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:30,790
Good morning, Mr. Qi.

91
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:38,000
You're up early.

92
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:39,950
Young Master.

93
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:47,550
You don't need to follow me today.

94
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:49,270
He's enough.

95
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:55,350
Give me the money.

96
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:00,640
Young Master!

97
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:03,640
Let's go.

98
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,480
Where are you going, Young Master?

99
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:07,790
Should I follow you?

100
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:08,510
No.

101
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,920
Please save some money, Young Master.

102
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,510
This is our own creation, Sir.

103
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:40,670
Put it on his shoulder.

104
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,200
Stand straight.

105
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:47,110
This rice is good too.

106
00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:48,110
Get me a bag of rice.

107
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:48,880
Sure!

108
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:49,760
Are you afraid

109
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:50,760
that they won't give you food?

110
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:52,160
I have money.

111
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:54,230
I'll spend it however I want.

112
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:55,000
Take it.

113
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:55,950
Here's your money.

114
00:06:58,640 --> 00:06:59,160
Let's go.

115
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,350
Why are you walking so slowly?

116
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:14,510
Come on, take a look.

117
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:16,160
Come and see.

118
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,350
Take a look.

119
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,600
Sir, what would you like?

120
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:31,110
What's the heaviest thing

121
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,880
you have here?

122
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,000
The heaviest?

123
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,390
Please follow me.

124
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:48,790
Mr. Qi,

125
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:51,000
come on, put it up here.

126
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:07,510
Where did this cart come from?

127
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,480
It's rented.

128
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,110
If I wasn't prepared well enough,

129
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:11,200
how could I ensure you

130
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,440
have a great time?

131
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:17,550
It's so boring. Let's go back.

132
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:18,550
It's still early.

133
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:19,600
Let's wander around.

134
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:20,270
For what?

135
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:21,270
What's there to see?

136
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,390
We've walked around for a while,

137
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:23,720
buying so many useless things.

138
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:25,110
I thought there would be

139
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:26,200
something new to see.

140
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:28,270
To see something new?

141
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:29,670
Come with me.

142
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:37,840
Where to?

143
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:39,910
A different world.

144
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:42,790
Aren't you most fascinated?

145
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,960
What kind of world is this?

146
00:08:58,910 --> 00:08:59,790
What are you looking at?

147
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:00,760
Move aside.

148
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:02,350
Do you think I'm looking at you?

149
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:03,710
Are you a fish?

150
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:06,520
Haven't you heard?

151
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,350
Heroic men and women often come

152
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:09,880
from the humblest of backgrounds.

153
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:11,760
This is the gathering place

154
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,200
of all kinds of people.

155
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:15,000
Really?

156
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:18,030
Didn't you say

157
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:19,110
you thought all these things

158
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:20,200
were useless?

159
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,280
Then why not

160
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:23,080
give them to those who can use them?

161
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,910
Come and see.

162
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:30,280
Mr. Qi is doing good deeds.

163
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,150
Come and see.

164
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,960
Mr. Qi is doing good deeds.

165
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,710
Everyone gets
a share of the food and oil.

166
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:47,670
Stop!

167
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:49,230
Give me one too.

168
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:54,150
Excuse me.

169
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:07,350
Grandpa, I'm hungry.

170
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,550
Don't worry.

171
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:10,320
Hey.

172
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:12,910
Sir,

173
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:15,520
we didn't get anything just now.

174
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:17,470
This child hasn't eaten for two days.

175
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:20,200
I still have some snacks here.

176
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:23,280
Thank you so much.

177
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,200
Here.

178
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:25,840
Take this.

179
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:28,790
Thanks. It's so nice of you.

180
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:29,710
Get up, please.

181
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:30,280
Thank you.

182
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:31,880
Get up. It's okay.

183
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:32,710
Get up.

184
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:33,840
It's okay.

185
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:34,640
Thank you.

186
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:35,760
Say thank you.

187
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:36,520
Thank you.

188
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:39,960
Thank you.

189
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,110
Alright, thank you.

190
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,000
Great.

191
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:49,670
It's great.

192
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,200
Being in the world

193
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,200
and doing chivalrous deeds,

194
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:52,910
today,

195
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:54,760
I robbed the rich to help the poor.

196
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:56,520
Robbed yourself?

197
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,280
I'm just being generous.

198
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,640
You are truly generous.

199
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:07,150
Let's prepare another cart.

200
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:08,400
There are still many people
who haven't received anything.

201
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:09,640
Enough.

202
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:10,840
I think your money bag

203
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,200
isn't holding much anymore.

204
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,640
Who do you look down on?

205
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:16,470
I have silver notes!

206
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:19,080
Alright,
let's talk about it another day.

207
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,200
It's just...

208
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:21,320
Let's do it today.

209
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,400
There are many people still waiting.

210
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:23,280
What to do then?

211
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:26,590
Sir, there are still fun things ahead.

212
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,670
Why don't you come with me?

213
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:29,440
What fun things?

214
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:30,710
It's fun.

215
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:31,640
Just come with me.

216
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:32,400
Then let's go.

217
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:34,280
It's getting late. Let's head back.

218
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,230
What time is it?

219
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:35,760
Why the rush?

220
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,400
Let's go have fun together!

221
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,710
The more you bet, the more you win.

222
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:40,880
Let's start betting now.

223
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:43,230
Come on,
the more you bet, the more you win.

224
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:44,350
The Brown King of Hell

225
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:46,280
versus the Black Fiend.

226
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,670
Right!
The more you bet, the more you win!

227
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:50,030
Come on, place your bets.

228
00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:51,670
The more you bet, the more you win.

229
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:53,710
Just watch, don't waste your money.

230
00:11:53,710 --> 00:11:55,110
Why are you talking like Lian Shu?

231
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,080
One copper coin.

232
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,590
I bet one copper coin.

233
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:00,440
Come on, I have it.

234
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:01,710
Come on.

235
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:03,640
I bet on the brown cock.

236
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:06,110
I bet on this brown one.

237
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:09,000
Alright, place your bets.

238
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,760
The cockfighting begins.

239
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:18,670
Bite it!

240
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:21,150
Bite it! Bite!

241
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:22,640
Yes, bite!

242
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:23,520
Bite it!

243
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:24,710
Good!

244
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:29,000
Bite it! Bite!

245
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:30,400
Bite it!

246
00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:31,030
Bite it!

247
00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:33,350
The brown one wins.

248
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:38,080
The brown cock has won.

249
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:40,150
Sir,

250
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:41,880
you are the brown cock's lucky star.

251
00:12:42,710 --> 00:12:43,640
The brown cock wins.

252
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:45,590
Let's do it again.

253
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:47,230
Come on, let's bet again.

254
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:49,400
Bet on the Brown King of Hell

255
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:51,280
or the Black Fiend.

256
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:53,960
Come on.

257
00:12:57,150 --> 00:12:58,030
The brown cock.

258
00:12:58,030 --> 00:12:58,550
Brown!

259
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:00,520
Thank you, Sir.

260
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,030
Come on.

261
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:03,960
Come on.

262
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:04,840
Come on.

263
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:08,110
The cockfighting begins.

264
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:13,320
Bite it! Bite!

265
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,110
Go!

266
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:17,080
Go!

267
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:22,030
Don't back down! Go!

268
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:31,880
The black cock wins.

269
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:36,880
The black cock has won.

270
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,030
The black cock has won.

271
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:42,520
Pay attention, Mr. Qi.

272
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:44,320
Just now, that brown cock didn't have

273
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,670
a white feather on its tail.

274
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:50,590
You switched the cock.

275
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:54,880
You're cheating.

276
00:13:56,910 --> 00:13:57,710
Guys,

277
00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:00,030
he is cheating.

278
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:00,960
This is a scam.

279
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:03,960
What are you saying?

280
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,350
Watch your mouth.

281
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:12,110
You all are in cahoots?

282
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:14,960
How dare you cause trouble here?

283
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,640
No, I didn't.

284
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:18,150
No?

285
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:19,840
Look at the table.

286
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:21,710
This is

287
00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:23,280
my family heirloom.

288
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,910
Look what you did to it.

289
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:26,840
If you don't pay for this today,

290
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:28,470
don't even think about leaving.

291
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:29,840
Pay up!

292
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:30,840
Pay up!

293
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:33,760
Don't even think about leaving.

294
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:36,910
It's just about paying, right?

295
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:39,080
You're making a fuss.

296
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:41,640
You're so tough now, huh?

297
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:45,760
Here you are.

298
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:50,710
Man,

299
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:52,760
You're trying to get rid of me

300
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:54,640
with this little money?

301
00:14:56,710 --> 00:14:58,200
Stop!

302
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:00,440
I have silver notes.

303
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:05,230
You all are ruthless.

304
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:10,710
Where's my silver notes?

305
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:12,230
Run! Why are you just standing there?

306
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,230
No money and you still want to run?

307
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,520
Run!

308
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:18,080

Run!

319
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:44,710
Run!

320
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:45,670
Run!

321
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:51,150
Stop!

322
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:03,320
Well,

The real underworld

325

has no brotherhood.

326

00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,030

What's wrong, Mr. Qi?

333
00:16:23,230 --> 00:16:24,590
You look a bit lost.

334
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:30,400
This is so thrilling!

335
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:31,840

Oh no!

338
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:39,640
If Lian Shu finds out

339
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:41,080
that I lost all the silver notes,

340
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:42,150
he'll definitely go crazy.

341
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:44,230

347
00:17:12,950 --> 00:17:13,920
Has he troubled you again?

348
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:15,950
I'll go talk to him.

349

You don't need to serve him anymore.

This is my own mess.

00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:24,160

I found a case

357
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:33,070

00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,190
the Xu Luan case
should be reinvestigated.

However, this case

Why don't I first

sort through the existing clues?

Let's do that.

370
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:54,590
This way I also have reason

371
00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:56,000
to go back and explain to Mr. Qi.

00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:33,590
it'll be effortless.

387
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:35,800
And I'll become famous in one go.

388
00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:37,350
So next time,

389
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:38,640
do we still bring that sissy along?

390
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,070
Sissy?

391
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:39,420
[File Room]

392
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,430
Welcome back, Chief Luo.

393
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:07,350
It's so late.

394
00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:08,520
Did you

395
00:20:08,590 --> 00:20:10,280
go to try a case with the magistrate?

396
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:12,800
Yes.

397
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:14,760
You can come with me tomorrow.

398
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:17,350
I won't waste time with you.

399
00:20:28,590 --> 00:20:29,040
Look,

400
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:30,680
pretty?

401
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:32,430
Yes.

402
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:38,920
When we came out of Mingke House,

403
00:20:39,470 --> 00:20:40,760
I didn't bring
a single piece of jewelry,

404
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:41,710
not even a silver ingot

405
00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:43,280
or a box of rouge.

406
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:44,800
I had to make do like this.

407
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:03,640
Here.

408
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:06,000
Take this and pawn it.

409
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,110
Buy what you want.

410
00:21:08,190 --> 00:21:09,880
You really have foresight.

411
00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:16,280
No, thanks.

412
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:18,760
This was left to you by Wuniang.

413
00:21:20,430 --> 00:21:21,430
Just take it.

414
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,190
You're my only good friend.

415
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:25,680
And you're much more important

416
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:26,520
than this hairpin.

417
00:21:31,310 --> 00:21:32,110
Get ready.

418
00:21:33,230 --> 00:21:33,760
Go.

419
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:37,800
Again.

420
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:41,920
Go.

421
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:45,160
Gather up.

422
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,110
Haven't you eaten?

423
00:21:50,430 --> 00:21:51,430
Just scratching an itch?

424
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:55,590
To catch the bandits,
you must first endure the beating.

425
00:21:56,430 --> 00:21:57,000
You.

426
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:58,680
And you.

427
00:21:59,000 --> 00:21:59,800
Come here.

428
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:02,640
Watch closely.

429
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:07,800
Come on.

430
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:13,880
Haven't you eaten?

431
00:22:14,430 --> 00:22:15,590
Haven't you eaten?

432
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:16,920
Come on.

433
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:21,430
Come on.

434
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:41,310
Did you see that?

435
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:42,310
Yes.

436
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:49,310
Miss Luo.

437
00:22:49,950 --> 00:22:51,000
Luo...

438
00:22:51,310 --> 00:22:52,950
What are you looking at?
Keep practicing.

439
00:22:53,070 --> 00:22:53,470
Yes.

440
00:22:53,590 --> 00:22:54,920
Keep practicing.

441
00:22:55,110 --> 00:22:55,920
Miss Luo.

442
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:57,680
Captain Cai,

443
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,350
can you do me a favor?

444
00:22:59,430 --> 00:23:00,400
Of course.

445
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,520
Baozi told me everything.

446
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:02,710
You can call me brother

447
00:23:02,710 --> 00:23:03,560
like Baozi.

448
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:05,110
Just tell me if you need anything.

449
00:23:06,830 --> 00:23:08,230
Thank you, Captain Cai.

450
00:23:09,230 --> 00:23:09,760
Call me brother.

451
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:11,920
Brother.

452
00:23:14,190 --> 00:23:15,070
I came today

453
00:23:15,230 --> 00:23:16,950
to discuss something

454
00:23:16,950 --> 00:23:17,680
with you and the coroner.

455
00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:21,070
Sure.

456
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,310
At Zi, Wu, Mao, and You,
pinch the middle finger.

457
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,680
At Chen, Xu, Chou, and Wei,
stretch the palm.

458
00:23:31,310 --> 00:23:32,230
What's the next line?

459
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,830
You can't remember this?

460
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:42,560
At Yin, Shen, Si, and Hai, make a fist.

461
00:23:42,590 --> 00:23:44,110
The time of death will not be mistaken.

462
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:46,110
What good

463
00:23:46,110 --> 00:23:46,830
is your head?

464
00:23:47,230 --> 00:23:48,350
Just for show, right?

465
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:50,400
You should leave it for someone

466
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,110
who needs it.

467
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:52,110
Miss Luo,

468
00:23:52,110 --> 00:23:53,160
if you have something to say,

469
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:54,310
can't you just tell me?

470
00:23:54,310 --> 00:23:55,950
Why do you have to find that freak Xu?

471
00:23:56,590 --> 00:23:57,560
You're a constable,

472
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:58,470
and he is a coroner.

473
00:23:58,470 --> 00:23:59,590
We need to talk to both.

474
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:07,070
Why?

475
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:07,880
Just put it on.

476
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:09,110
You'll understand soon.

477
00:24:23,310 --> 00:24:25,190
What do you think
you're doing as a coroner?

478
00:24:25,470 --> 00:24:26,520
You can't even smell

479
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:27,230
a hint of it.

480
00:24:27,230 --> 00:24:28,800
Is this a hint?

481
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,070
Why do I have to train you?

482
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,160
Weren't you swearing

483
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:40,230
not to come here again?

484
00:24:40,590 --> 00:24:42,000
Do you think I want to be here?

485
00:24:48,950 --> 00:24:50,110
You must be the newcomer.

486
00:24:52,230 --> 00:24:53,040
I'm...

487
00:24:56,230 --> 00:24:57,070
Don't stay here.

488
00:24:57,070 --> 00:24:58,160
I can't take it. Let's go.

489
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,760
I'm not going out.
There's light outside.

490
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:00,520
Let's go.

491
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:01,640
Put me down.

492
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,470
Captain Cai, put me down.

493
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:04,830
There's light outside. Put me...

494
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:06,950
You...

495
00:25:07,470 --> 00:25:07,800
Go.

496
00:25:10,830 --> 00:25:11,920
I'm busy right now.

497
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:13,950
If you have something to say, say it.

498
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,760
About the Xu Luan case
tried by the former magistrate,

499
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,280
do you still remember?

500
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:28,400
That night, it was raining heavily.

501
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,880
Lin Xiong came to report.

502
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:33,950
He said his wife was murdered.

503
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:43,350
Sir.

504
00:26:03,470 --> 00:26:04,680
So much blood.

505
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:07,070
Lin Xiong was clean.

506
00:26:07,070 --> 00:26:08,310
Not a trace of blood on him?

507
00:26:09,830 --> 00:26:10,760
That's right.

508
00:26:10,950 --> 00:26:13,110
He was soaked to the skin,

509
00:26:13,110 --> 00:26:14,400
but there was no blood.

510
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,350
That's strange.

511
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:18,350
So why was Xu Luan suspected?

512
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:19,560
He was a water deliveryman.

513
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:20,920
Neighbors said

514
00:26:20,950 --> 00:26:22,800
he delivered water to Lin's place

515
00:26:22,830 --> 00:26:24,520
before the murder happened.

516
00:26:25,310 --> 00:26:27,070
Delivering water late at night
is indeed unusual.

517
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:29,350
But can this be used as evidence?

518
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:32,560
The former magistrate

519
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:33,400
focused

520
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:34,760
on this point

521
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:35,680
and concluded

522
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:37,640
that Xu Luan had an affair with Lin Liu.

523
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:38,950
That's why he killed her.

524
00:26:41,430 --> 00:26:42,520
How do you see it, Mr. Xu?

525
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:45,520
I see with my eyes.

526
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,640
Am I supposed to rely on hearsay?

527
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:50,710
That day, I arrived later

528
00:26:50,710 --> 00:26:51,560
than Cai Dabing.

529
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:53,110
I got there at dawn.

530
00:27:09,710 --> 00:27:11,350
Lin Liu was stabbed over ten times,

531
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:12,590
but the fatal wound

532
00:27:12,590 --> 00:27:13,950
is only one in the heart.

533
00:27:15,310 --> 00:27:16,470
It seems the murderer

534
00:27:16,470 --> 00:27:17,280
only cut her head off

535
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:18,470
after she died.

536
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:21,070
Do you think Xu Luan is the murderer?

537
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:23,830
I'm just a coroner.

538
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,230
Does my opinion matter?

539
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,160
But you clearly have

540
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:28,230
your own judgment.

541
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:29,760
The conclusion has already been made.

542
00:27:30,310 --> 00:27:30,920
We can't

543
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:32,350
question it.

544
00:27:36,710 --> 00:27:38,590
Cutting the head takes time and effort.

545
00:27:39,830 --> 00:27:40,800
She had already

546
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:42,110
been murdered.

547
00:27:42,310 --> 00:27:43,920
Why did the murderer
take that extra step?

548
00:27:45,470 --> 00:27:46,310
Unless...

549
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:51,590
Unless he hated Lin Liu deeply.

550
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,000
After stabbing her multiple times,

551
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,190
he decapitated her.

552
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:56,470
It's clearly an act of vengeance.

553
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:58,950
You have some brains.

554
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:00,880
But I still say,

555
00:28:01,190 --> 00:28:02,880
we should follow orders.

556
00:28:04,110 --> 00:28:05,280
How the case should be decided

557
00:28:05,430 --> 00:28:06,830
is up to the officials.

558
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:11,920
Such cruelty

559
00:28:12,070 --> 00:28:13,350
must stem from deep hatred.

560
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:15,350
Yet the records say nothing of it.

561
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:17,640
They only mention
Xu Luan and Lin Liu's affair.

562
00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:19,680
There can be love turning to hate,

563
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:21,230
but why did an affair

564
00:28:21,230 --> 00:28:22,400
escalate to murder?

565
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:24,400
This should be clarified
before conviction.

566
00:28:26,310 --> 00:28:27,110
That's right.

567
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:29,310
This case has many doubts.

568
00:28:29,310 --> 00:28:30,350
It should be retried.

569
00:28:30,350 --> 00:28:30,920
No way.

570
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:32,710
The case is closed.

571
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,310
Don't create further troubles.

572
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:35,430
Mr. Chen...

573
00:28:35,430 --> 00:28:36,350
Your task

574
00:28:36,350 --> 00:28:37,520
is to organize the records,

575
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:38,640
not to investigate.

576
00:28:40,590 --> 00:28:42,110
There are still doubts in this case,

577
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,040
so it should be pursued.

578
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:44,190
This is the last case

579
00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:45,800
decided by the former magistrate.

580
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:46,710
You just took office,

581
00:28:46,710 --> 00:28:47,950
and you want to retry it.

582
00:28:47,950 --> 00:28:49,230
Will you have friends in the future?

583
00:28:49,230 --> 00:28:50,520
Do you still want your reputation?

584
00:28:50,710 --> 00:28:51,470
Did I become an official

585
00:28:51,470 --> 00:28:52,590
to make friends?

586
00:28:52,590 --> 00:28:53,830
But don't forget,

587
00:28:53,830 --> 00:28:55,520
the former magistrate has been promoted.

588
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:57,190
He's your superior now.

589
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:58,310
Do you not understand

590
00:28:58,310 --> 00:28:59,470
the stakes?

591
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:09,830
Investigate it.

592
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:10,590
Muzhi!

593
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,190
Since I've been favored by the Emperor

594
00:29:12,190 --> 00:29:14,000
to protect a region,

595
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:14,920
and to guide the people,

596
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,470
I must ensure
there are no wrongs unrighted

597
00:29:16,470 --> 00:29:17,880
and no cases left uninvestigated.

598
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:19,190
But think of the consequences.

599
00:29:19,230 --> 00:29:21,000
Right now, we have no evidence.

600
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:23,310
Everything was just her speculation.

601
00:29:23,710 --> 00:29:24,950
Mr. Chen has a point.

602
00:29:25,470 --> 00:29:26,640
I was rash.

603
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:28,310
I shouldn't have
hastily suggested a retrial.

604
00:29:29,310 --> 00:29:30,310
You don't need to overthink it.

605
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,070
As the magistrate,

606
00:29:32,230 --> 00:29:34,110
I should investigate
when there's a case.

607
00:29:36,620 --> 00:29:46,020
[Linfen Yamen]

608
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:52,640
Pretty clever.

609
00:29:53,470 --> 00:29:54,160
Why didn't you

610
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:55,640
wait outside for me today?

611
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:57,310
Sorry, Mr. Qi.

612
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:59,310
The magistrate sent me
to investigate a case.

613
00:29:59,470 --> 00:30:01,070
From now on, I can't help you.

614
00:30:01,070 --> 00:30:03,190
You're going to investigate?

615
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:04,590
What case?

616
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,110
The case of Xu Luan killing Lin Liu.

617
00:30:06,230 --> 00:30:07,560
You're investigating this case too?

618
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:08,230
No.

619
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:10,000
I was going to investigate it first.

620
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:15,310
Alright.

621
00:30:15,430 --> 00:30:16,230
Then I'll reluctantly

622
00:30:16,230 --> 00:30:17,520
let you be my assistant this time.

623
00:30:17,830 --> 00:30:18,560
Let me tell you,

624
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:20,040
you're in for a stroke of luck.

625
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,160
Last night,

626
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:21,800
I worked hard

627
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:22,920
and reviewed

628
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:23,560
103 crime-solving techniques.

629
00:30:27,430 --> 00:30:28,430
Listen,

630
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:30,110
if you can't see

631
00:30:30,110 --> 00:30:31,640
any marks on the body,

632
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:32,950
do you know what to do?

633
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:34,110
Let me tell you,

634
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:36,160
use draff and white vinegar

635
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,920
to wash and apply heat,

636
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,280
and the bruises will show up.

637
00:30:39,950 --> 00:30:41,110
The body we're going to examine

638
00:30:41,110 --> 00:30:42,350
has been buried for how long?

639
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:43,880
But that's fine.

640
00:30:43,950 --> 00:30:45,000
Even if it's rotten

641
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:45,880
down to just the bones,

642
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:47,470
there are ways to examine bones.

643
00:30:49,830 --> 00:30:50,680
Mr. Qi,

644
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:51,950
aren't you just talking big?

645
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:54,070
What's that?

646
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:55,560
Are you doubting

647
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:57,070
my ability to investigate?

648
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:59,000
No need to doubt.

649
00:30:59,070 --> 00:30:59,920
Don't even talk about killing people.

650
00:30:59,950 --> 00:31:00,560
My young master has never seen

651
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:01,950
a chicken being killed.

652
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:02,640
You...

653
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:03,280
I...

654
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:05,000
Well, we'll see.

655
00:31:05,950 --> 00:31:07,040
Don't listen to his nonsense.

656
00:31:09,350 --> 00:31:10,590
The gates are locked.

657
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:13,470
Man, have some tea.

658
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:18,680
I have a plan.

659
00:31:19,470 --> 00:31:20,280
Lian Shu,

660
00:31:21,110 --> 00:31:23,070
let's use the old trick.

661
00:31:24,190 --> 00:31:25,560
Are we climbing over again?

662
00:31:25,830 --> 00:31:26,640
Come on.

663
00:31:27,350 --> 00:31:28,680
Yes, Young Master.

664
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:30,400
Hold steady.

665
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:36,310
Be careful.

666
00:31:39,430 --> 00:31:39,920
Look.

667
00:31:40,230 --> 00:31:41,190
There's someone over there.

668
00:31:43,470 --> 00:31:43,830
Let's go.

669
00:31:47,310 --> 00:31:47,950
Luo...

670
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:50,950
Officer.

671
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:52,950
Come on.

672
00:31:52,950 --> 00:31:54,470
Please give me some tea.

673
00:31:54,470 --> 00:31:55,800
Sure, just a moment.

674
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:58,350
Lian Shu,

675
00:31:58,760 --> 00:31:59,760
help me down.

676
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:01,880
Here's a strong, fragrant cup of tea

677
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:03,040
to quench your thirst.

678
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:04,000
Thank you.

679
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:04,590
You're welcome.

680
00:32:04,590 --> 00:32:06,110
What are you doing?

681
00:32:06,110 --> 00:32:06,880
Not investigating properly,

682
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:07,880
but here you are drinking tea.

683
00:32:13,430 --> 00:32:14,190
May I ask

684
00:32:14,590 --> 00:32:15,590
how long your tea house

685
00:32:15,590 --> 00:32:16,520
has been here?

686
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:18,800
It's been quite a while.

687
00:32:19,310 --> 00:32:20,430
About seven or eight years.

688
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:21,710
Do you know Xu Luan?

689
00:32:22,310 --> 00:32:23,310
Xu Luan?

690
00:32:23,310 --> 00:32:24,800
He's just a neighbor in the street.

691
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:26,230
Of course, I know him.

692
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:31,560
Officer,

693
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:33,430
are you perhaps

694
00:32:37,350 --> 00:32:38,280
planning to reopen the case?

695
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:41,470
Do you know something about it?

696
00:32:42,110 --> 00:32:43,470
The magistrate just took office,

697
00:32:43,590 --> 00:32:45,110
and needs to reorganize the records.

698
00:32:45,190 --> 00:32:46,640
So I came to ask about the situation.

699
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:48,430
Do you know

700
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:50,070
anything about this case?

701
00:32:50,110 --> 00:32:51,880
I know quite a bit!

702
00:32:52,430 --> 00:32:53,470
That night,

703
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:55,230
I heard some noise,

704
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:56,280
so I ran out to check.

705
00:32:56,590 --> 00:32:57,710
At Lin Xiong's place,

706
00:32:58,590 --> 00:32:59,830
where you just

707
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:01,400
climbed over the wall,

708
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:03,880
the gates were wide open.

709
00:33:04,430 --> 00:33:05,520
Inside the house,

710
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:07,040
my goodness,

711
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:08,470
it was all blood!

712
00:33:09,110 --> 00:33:10,190
I've always said,

713
00:33:10,430 --> 00:33:11,160
whoever married

714
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:12,680
Liu Sanniang

715
00:33:14,190 --> 00:33:15,280
would surely have trouble

716
00:33:15,430 --> 00:33:16,430
at home.

717
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:20,560
What was wrong

718
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:21,560
with Lin Liu?

719
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:22,920
She herself

720
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:25,280
was a problem.

721
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:28,040
She flaunted her looks

722
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:30,830
and acted coy all day long.

723
00:33:30,830 --> 00:33:32,640
She strutted
back and forth on the street

724
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:33,950
like a snake,

725
00:33:34,110 --> 00:33:35,280
almost twisting herself.

726
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:37,470
She posed

727
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:39,160
and flirted with men.

728
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:41,160
Now that she's dead,

729
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:42,400
why are you still talking about this?

730
00:33:43,310 --> 00:33:45,160
Do you know something too?

731
00:33:45,230 --> 00:33:45,880
Liu Sanniang...

732
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:46,280
What?

733
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:48,470
She could do it,
but I can't talk about it?

734
00:33:48,830 --> 00:33:50,040
The officers are investigating,

735
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:50,920
not here

736
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:52,110
to listen to your nonsense, okay?

737
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,040
Which ear heard

738
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:54,000
me talking nonsense?

739
00:33:54,350 --> 00:33:54,800
Which of my words

740
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:55,710
didn't make sense?

741
00:33:55,710 --> 00:33:56,640
Look at you these days...

742
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:57,880
Is this how you investigate a case?

743
00:33:58,470 --> 00:33:59,880
We run a tea house.

744
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:01,560
What did I say?

745
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:02,470
What did you say?

746
00:34:02,470 --> 00:34:03,350
Let me tell you,

747
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:04,710
if Liu Sanniang
didn't do anything wrong,

748
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:05,950
then why did Xu Luan

749
00:34:06,190 --> 00:34:07,800
kill her and not anyone else?

750
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:08,840
I find it strange.

751
00:34:08,870 --> 00:34:10,000
Instead of scolding the killer,

752
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:10,600
you're pointing fingers

753
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:11,870
at the victim.

754
00:34:11,870 --> 00:34:13,150
It's simply ridiculous.

755
00:34:13,950 --> 00:34:15,560
I see that Liu Sanniang is dead,

756
00:34:15,870 --> 00:34:16,710
and the one most heartbroken

757
00:34:16,710 --> 00:34:17,760
is you.

758
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:18,320
What are you talking about?

759
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:19,230
I'm talking about you!

760
00:34:19,230 --> 00:34:20,280
You're simply unreasonable.

761
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:21,630
Pastries and fruits are free to eat,

762
00:34:21,630 --> 00:34:22,360
right?

763
00:34:22,630 --> 00:34:23,870
We can eat whatever we want for free?

764
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:25,520
Don't try to trick us.

765
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:26,280
Young Master.

766
00:34:26,710 --> 00:34:27,560
Don't ask us for money.

767
00:34:27,630 --> 00:34:30,120
No money, eat freely.

768
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,710
Lian Shu, go buy some snacks.

769
00:34:34,950 --> 00:34:36,520
Tea is enough, Young Master.

770
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:37,910
Come on.

771
00:34:37,910 --> 00:34:38,800
Please sit down.

772
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:42,280
Sit! No charge!

773
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:43,950
That's great.

774
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:44,870
Everyone,

775
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:46,600
please have some tea.

776
00:34:46,870 --> 00:34:49,040
This tea isn't for nothing.

777
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:50,520
It still costs money?

778
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:52,280
What are you talking about?

779
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:54,280
We just want

780
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:55,390
to have a chat with you.

781
00:34:56,870 --> 00:34:57,630
Chatting?

782
00:34:57,630 --> 00:35:00,080
Chatting is our specialty.

783
00:35:00,190 --> 00:35:01,150
We love chatting.

784
00:35:01,230 --> 00:35:01,910
Well,

785
00:35:01,910 --> 00:35:04,150
many hands make light work.

786
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:05,710
Thank you.

787
00:35:06,710 --> 00:35:08,560
It's for justice.

788
00:35:10,390 --> 00:35:11,710
Today, we're here

789
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:13,600
to talk with you

790
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:15,150
about the Lin Liu case.

791
00:35:15,470 --> 00:35:17,080
Let's eat.

792
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:18,910
Officer, let me tell you,

793
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:20,120
when this case got solved,

794
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:21,840
I made a great contribution.

795
00:35:22,670 --> 00:35:24,000
I told the constables

796
00:35:24,230 --> 00:35:25,360
that Xu Luan and Lin Liu

797
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:26,190
were having an affair.

798
00:35:26,670 --> 00:35:28,470
How did you find out?

799
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:29,430
We live

800
00:35:29,430 --> 00:35:30,840
next door to them.

801
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,670
How could I not know what was going on?

802
00:35:33,430 --> 00:35:35,560
When Lin Xiong wasn't home,

803
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:37,430
Xu Luan would go deliver water.

804
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:39,670
Those two must have something going on.

805
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:40,600
Right?

806
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:42,190
They definitely had something going on.

807
00:35:42,190 --> 00:35:43,080
Officer,

808
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:44,320
Xu Luan and Lin Xiong

809
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:45,470
were childhood friends.

810
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:47,230
Xu Luan was a sleazy guy

811
00:35:47,230 --> 00:35:48,470
who often drank too much

812
00:35:48,470 --> 00:35:49,280
and started rambling.

813
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:50,950
He didn't care about

814
00:35:50,950 --> 00:35:52,600
Lin Xiong's face.

815
00:35:52,630 --> 00:35:54,280
Gradually, their relationship

816
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:55,760
wasn't as good as it had been.

817
00:35:56,150 --> 00:35:56,910
From what I see,

818
00:35:56,910 --> 00:35:57,760
Xu Luan

819
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:59,230
looked down on Lin Xiong.

820
00:35:59,630 --> 00:36:00,470
That's right.

821
00:36:01,230 --> 00:36:02,670
My husband told me

822
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:04,870
that Xu Luan often belittled

823
00:36:04,870 --> 00:36:06,080
Lin Xiong

824
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:08,630
and had been flirting

825
00:36:08,630 --> 00:36:10,360
with his wife, Liu Sanniang.

826
00:36:10,430 --> 00:36:11,840
Xu Luan had been getting quite cozy

827
00:36:12,190 --> 00:36:13,950
with Liu Sanniang.

828
00:36:14,430 --> 00:36:16,040
If you say nothing was going on,

829
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:17,320
who would believe that?

830
00:36:17,710 --> 00:36:20,080
But you didn't know her background.

831
00:36:20,950 --> 00:36:23,150
About Liu Sanniang's background.

832
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:24,040
it was actually I

833
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:25,190
who first told everyone.

834
00:36:26,710 --> 00:36:29,670
She was a widow who remarried.

835
00:36:29,710 --> 00:36:31,670
She used to live
in the west of the city.

836
00:36:40,190 --> 00:36:42,950
Her late husband was Li Fengchun.

837
00:36:43,390 --> 00:36:44,190
I heard

838
00:36:44,190 --> 00:36:46,190
he died
while doing business away from home.

839
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:49,470
And before his body was even cold,

840
00:36:49,630 --> 00:36:51,120
she hurriedly remarried

841
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:52,320
Lin Xiong.

842
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:54,600
So I'm not wrong here.

843
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,190
As for Liu Sanniang,

844
00:36:56,190 --> 00:36:58,230
she was quite promiscuous.

845
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:04,800
Wait for me.

846
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,040
What?

847
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:25,870
What are you talking about?

848
00:37:25,870 --> 00:37:27,360
I haven't even gotten to the point yet.

849
00:37:27,470 --> 00:37:28,280
Officer,

850
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:31,000
let me tell you a shocking secret.

851
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:33,600
Liu Sanniang got married to Lin Xiong

852
00:37:33,870 --> 00:37:34,910
for only six months,

853
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:35,950
and she

854
00:37:35,950 --> 00:37:37,470
already had a son.

855
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:40,600
Everyone knows that.

856
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:42,000
The whole street knows.

857
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:42,910
Wasn't Lin Xiong

858
00:37:42,910 --> 00:37:44,670
just a nominal father?

859
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:47,390
You're mistaken there.

860
00:37:47,710 --> 00:37:48,760
How so?

861
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:50,150
I've drunk with Lin Xiong.

862
00:37:50,390 --> 00:37:51,190
When he got drunk,

863
00:37:51,190 --> 00:37:52,470
he told me everything.

864
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:54,950
While Li Fengchun was still alive,

865
00:37:54,950 --> 00:37:55,870
Liu Sanniang and Lin Xiong

866
00:37:55,870 --> 00:37:57,320
were already involved.

867
00:37:57,950 --> 00:37:59,910
That child is Lin Xiong's.

868
00:37:59,910 --> 00:38:00,950
Otherwise, why would Lin Xiong

869
00:38:00,950 --> 00:38:02,430
want a widow?

870
00:38:02,430 --> 00:38:04,280
First Lin Xiong, then Xu Luan,

871
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:06,040
who knows how many more there were?

872
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:07,360
Well, Lin Xiong

873
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:09,230
could take out five of them
in one punch,

874
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:10,840
but Xu Luan still had the guts

875
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:12,520
to fool around

876
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:13,670
with Liu Sanniang.

877
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:15,230
He must have been enchanted

878
00:38:15,230 --> 00:38:17,150
by that seductive woman.

879
00:38:17,470 --> 00:38:20,000
Sanniang, I'll help you.

880
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:22,800
I can do it.

881
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,150
Let me help you.

882
00:38:24,150 --> 00:38:25,150
No, thank you.

883
00:38:25,150 --> 00:38:25,870
Yes.

884
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:27,280
It's broad daylight. Look!

885
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:28,670
So shameless.

886
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:30,630
No,

887
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,190
thank you.

888
00:38:38,150 --> 00:38:39,800
She's smiling so seductively.

889
00:38:42,150 --> 00:38:43,040
Was Lin Xiong

890
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:44,600
being cuckolded

891
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:46,280
and still denying it?

892
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:57,600
They really have a good appetite.

893
00:38:57,950 --> 00:38:59,430
And they even took
the leftovers with them.

894
00:38:59,950 --> 00:39:01,230
Xu Luan and Liu Sanniang

895
00:39:01,230 --> 00:39:02,230
were having an affair.

896
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:05,080
So why did he kill her?

897
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:08,710
Liu Sanniang?

898
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:10,120
Yes.

899
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:12,080
You often sell goods in this area.

900
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:13,280
Did you have any contact with her?

901
00:39:14,670 --> 00:39:15,710
Of course.

902
00:39:15,870 --> 00:39:16,760
We often saw

903
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:17,800
each other.

904
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:32,630
I didn't expect her

905
00:39:32,630 --> 00:39:33,910
to be killed.

906
00:39:34,470 --> 00:39:35,760
Liu Sanniang was an honest woman.

907
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:36,800
She occasionally bought

908
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,520
some sewing supplies from me.

909
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:39,710
She didn't talk much.

910
00:39:39,910 --> 00:39:41,000
She would just buy and leave.

911
00:39:41,910 --> 00:39:44,120
I didn't have much contact with her.

912
00:39:44,150 --> 00:39:46,360
She seemed to have a good temperament,

913
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:47,320
but she didn't smile much.

914
00:39:47,630 --> 00:39:50,120
She looked like she was always troubled.

915
00:39:51,150 --> 00:39:51,950
Yes.

916
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:54,360
Whenever she came out, she looked down,

917
00:39:54,470 --> 00:39:56,000
not daring to look people in the eye.

918
00:39:57,390 --> 00:39:58,910
This widow,

919
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:00,710
she must feel a bit ashamed.

920
00:40:01,870 --> 00:40:02,670
Sanniang, let me help.

921
00:40:02,670 --> 00:40:03,630
I'll carry it for you.

922
00:40:03,670 --> 00:40:04,280
No need.

923
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:05,280
It's fine. I'll carry it.

924
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:07,760
I don't need your help.

925
00:40:17,190 --> 00:40:19,150
She usually avoided people,

926
00:40:19,670 --> 00:40:20,710
and rarely came out.

927
00:40:21,230 --> 00:40:22,080
As for Xu Luan,

928
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:24,000
he did know Lin Xiong.

929
00:40:24,190 --> 00:40:25,360
But except for delivering water,

930
00:40:25,950 --> 00:40:27,150
he seldom visited.

931
00:40:27,150 --> 00:40:28,560
Xu Luan wasn't really

932
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:29,670
a wicked person.

933
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,470
He just liked to take little advantages.

934
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:33,710
Once he owed me some money,

935
00:40:34,150 --> 00:40:34,870
and he wouldn't admit it.

936
00:40:35,230 --> 00:40:36,190
That's the kind of person he was.

937
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:39,230
If you have nothing else,

938
00:40:39,230 --> 00:40:40,470
we'll take our leave.

939
00:40:40,470 --> 00:40:41,190
Goodbye.

940
00:40:48,630 --> 00:40:49,430
Wait.

941
00:40:50,670 --> 00:40:51,470
Were these two groups

942
00:40:51,470 --> 00:40:53,150
talking about the same Liu Sanniang?

943
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:54,870
Of course.

944
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:57,040
It's just that she appeared differently

945
00:40:57,150 --> 00:40:58,670
in the eyes of different people.

946
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:10,560
Lin Xiong.

947
00:41:15,950 --> 00:41:16,870
Come in and speak.

948
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:20,000
When I reported,

949
00:41:20,430 --> 00:41:22,000
the officers came to take a look.

950
00:41:22,670 --> 00:41:24,320
Later, they took Xu Luan away.

951
00:41:24,870 --> 00:41:26,320
In about two days,

952
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:27,670
the case was decided.

953
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:30,760
They didn't even call me to testify.

954
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:33,430
So I know nothing.

955
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:38,360
Do you believe Xu Luan is the murderer?

956
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,190
I don't know.

957
00:41:43,630 --> 00:41:46,710
But from what I know of Xu Luan,

958
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,430
he doesn't have the ability to kill.

959
00:41:57,190 --> 00:41:58,560
There are rumors

960
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:00,560
that Xu Luan and Liu Sanniang

961
00:42:00,910 --> 00:42:01,800
had an affair.

962
00:42:10,870 --> 00:42:11,670
Han,

963
00:42:12,230 --> 00:42:13,430
you must reopen this case

964
00:42:13,470 --> 00:42:14,800
for a thorough investigation.

965
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:19,950
As Mr. Qi said,

966
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:21,080
compared to Xu Luan,

967
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:22,870
Lin Xiong
indeed had more motive to kill.

968
00:42:23,390 --> 00:42:24,950
Lin Liu was beautiful,

969
00:42:24,950 --> 00:42:26,360
which made her the target of gossip.

970
00:42:26,390 --> 00:42:27,360
When Lin Xiong heard

971
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:28,710
about her affair with Xu Luan,

972
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:30,360
how could he just swallow his anger?

973
00:42:30,710 --> 00:42:31,470
The former magistrate

974
00:42:31,470 --> 00:42:33,000
probably believed the rumors

975
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:34,800
and made a biased judgment.

976
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:36,190
He didn't even summon Lin Xiong

977
00:42:36,230 --> 00:42:37,870
before coercing a confession
from Xu Luan.

978
00:42:37,950 --> 00:42:39,000
But isn't your judgment

979
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,520
also biased?

980
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:44,710
Do you remember

981
00:42:44,710 --> 00:42:45,910
where I was

982
00:42:45,910 --> 00:42:46,670
working before.

983
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:48,760
If a person

984
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:50,800
spends every day
dealing with insincerity,

985
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,600
and is used to false flattery,

986
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:54,430
then they will have some ability

987
00:42:54,430 --> 00:42:55,870
to discern truth from lies.

988
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:57,390
Indeed,

989
00:42:57,840 --> 00:42:58,950
this case should be retried.
