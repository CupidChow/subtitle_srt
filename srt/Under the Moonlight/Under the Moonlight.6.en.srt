[Adapted from the novel
"Jin Nang" by Shui He]

00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:33,260
[Episode 6]

4
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:34,950
What about you?

5
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:37,310
you're useless and uneducated,

6
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:39,120
always riding
on your father's coattails,

7
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:39,830
annoying everyone,

8
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:41,120
yet feeling so pleased with yourself.

9
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:43,270
Even if we are lowly,

10
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,590
we live on our own.

11
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:45,950
But you're

12
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,310
a completely loser

13
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:48,800
under the family's protection!

14
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:49,440
I...

15
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:51,830
You!

16
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:55,680
How could you curse me?

17
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:57,400
You did such a nasty thing

18
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,440
in Yamen,

19
00:01:58,440 --> 00:01:59,480
but still try to curse me?

20
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,310
Just wait!

21
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:12,750
Thanks for helping me just now.

22
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:16,390
To deal with this sort of lowly one,

23
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:18,190
no need to reason with her.

24
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:19,080
You have to deal

25
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,630
with her as she deals with you.

26
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:21,270
Yeah.

27
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:22,750
I have to remind you.

28
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:23,910
If someone saw you

29
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:24,720
to defend

30
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,000
the two ladies of Music House,

31
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:26,670
you would be gossiped about

32
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:28,470
and get your career ruined.

33
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:30,190
I promised to protect them.

34
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:32,030
I wouldn't go back on my words.

35
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,800
Nothing else?

36
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:18,600
Young Master,

37
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,110
I've got the gong

38
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:20,240
for you.

39
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,440
What's the use of it?

40
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,470
Take it. It'll be useful.

41
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:26,910
Young Master, what are you making?

42
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,630
Is it poisonous?

43
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:30,270
Don't worry.

44
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,520
It's the refined pill

45
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,520
made by my brother's

46
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,440
Taoist friends.

47
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,160
It's non-toxic.

48
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:37,190
But

49
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:40,160
whoever eats one of them

50
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,960
will get hot all over the body

51
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,440
and feel incredibly itch.

52
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:46,190
What a terrible pill!

53
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:47,320
Could it be substandard
and discarded by someone,

54
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,750
but taken back by you?

55
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:51,910
Young Master,

56
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,670
when shall I strike this gong?

57
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,030
Knock it...

58
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,600
Knock it when I tell you to do so!

59
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:03,190
When he's most disgraced,

60
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:04,360
you knock the gong hard.

61
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:06,440
Attract everyone

62
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:07,390
in Yamen to come to see him.

63
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,160
You're horny, huh?

64
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,270
I'll make you

65
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:56,510
disgraced

66
00:04:56,510 --> 00:04:58,110
in this great way.

67
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:44,830
Go.

68
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:34,510
You bastard,

69
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:35,880
get your ass out of here!

70
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:37,720
Still don't come out?

71
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,510
Well then.

72
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,880
It's a rare edition,

73
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,600
worth ten liang silver.

74
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,670
I didn't expect he could

75
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:53,790
bear with the pill effect.

76
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:21,600
Great.

77
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:23,760
He feels hot now.

78
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:25,320
Wait!

79
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,510
Wait?

80
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:28,510
We better do it now.

81
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:30,230
Or, he might go to the street.

82
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:31,830
It'll be even better

83
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,760
as more people could see it.

84
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:35,110
Hurry.

85
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:38,880
Quick.

86
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:47,830
Hurry.

87
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:03,640
Too bad.

88
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:04,920
There's no one around.

89
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:06,480
Go call

90
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,790
some people neayby to come over.

91
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:09,830
When shall I strike the gong?

92
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,320
As soon as I shout,

93
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:12,920
you'll strike it right away.

94
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:13,920
Yes, Young Master.

95
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,000
A...

96
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:52,760
A woman?

97
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:00,880
Are you a man or a woman?

98
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:05,230
How could you be a woman?

99
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,400
No, you're a man!

100
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:11,080
None of your business!

101
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,440
If you were a woman, I...

102
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:14,960
You're definitely not a woman.

103
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,000
You must be a sissy

104
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:16,790
and have the quirk

105
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:17,640
of wearing a woman's shoes.

106
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Are you crazy?

107
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,030
Young Master has done it?

108
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,670
Go, go. Hurry up!

109
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:42,760
Something is happening.

110
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,080
Right over there.

111
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,280
Come with me.

112
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:52,640
What's happening?

113
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:53,880
Don't ask here.

114
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:56,280
Go check it now! Come on!

115
00:09:56,910 --> 00:09:57,840
Someone is dead!

116
00:09:58,470 --> 00:09:59,880
Lianshu, give me a hand!

117
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:00,590
Young Master!

118
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,710
Is he dead?

119
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:03,230
Young Master,

120
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:04,350
are you all right?

121
00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:06,000
Why is the body naked?

122
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:06,760
Young Master!

123
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,080
Hold on, please!

124
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:08,790
Young Master.

125
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:10,760
Young Master, open your eyes.

126
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:11,960
Young Master.

127
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,670
Stop yelling. He's still alive.

128
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:14,590
Go bring a carriage here.

129
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:17,000
Young Master, hold on!

130
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:19,590
Go bring a carriage here.

131
00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:21,000
Young Master,

132
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,320
look at me,

133
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,030
Young Master.

134
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:25,320
Wake up please!

135
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,150
Stop crying.

136
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:28,400
Others may think

137
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,790
it's a funeral procession.

138
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:31,200
My Young Master

139
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,840
never suffered this before.

140
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:34,840
If he dies,

141
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,910
how am I going to live?

142
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:38,670
Mr. Xu can check on him
after we go back.

143
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,280
He knows something about medicine too.

144
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:43,030
He's a post-mortem examiner!

145
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:45,350
My Young Master is not dead yet.

146
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:47,760
Then,

147
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,960
I'll call a good doctor.

148
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,910
Yes, call the best one.

149
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,840
Oh, no need to do it.

150
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,000
No need?

151
00:10:58,230 --> 00:11:00,200
I usually take care of Young Master

152
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,440
when he's sick.

153
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,200
The strange doctors

154
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,790
are not good

155
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:04,590
or trustworthy.

156
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:06,230
I can do it.

157
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:22,200
Your Honor.

158
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,110
Is it

159
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:24,670
the naked body you found in the river?

160
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:29,350
Mr. Qi found it.

161
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,350
Go get changed,

162
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:42,350
or you may catch cold.

163
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,590
Take the carriage to the mortuary.

164
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:12,910
Shu.

165
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,200
Come in.

166
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,790
Shu, I bring you hot water.

167
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:20,520
You prepare it for me.

168
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:21,280
Thank you so much!

169
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:22,550
I'll get you more.

170
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:24,150
You better take a bath.

171
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:25,590
I'm afraid you may catch cold.

172
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:26,790
No need.

173
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:27,790
Thanks for your concern.

174
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:29,470
By the way,

175
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:30,910
when I just got back,

176
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:32,350
I met Ms. Sun at the gate.

177
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:34,000
Why did she
pack her belongings and leave?

178
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:35,760
She took Madam's money in private,

179
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,400
rating on you and Miaocui.

180
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:38,550
Magistrate was angry after knowing this

181
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:40,080
and sacked her at once.

182
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:40,670
He also said

183
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:41,550
the county Yamen

184
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:42,840
will never hire her in the future!

185
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,150
Magistrate also told me

186
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:47,030
to bring you

187
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:48,440
the hot water.

188
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:51,230
He has a good heart,

189
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:52,200
and is

190
00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:54,000
very handsome.

191
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,000
I wonder

192
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,200
who will be so lucky

193
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:58,400
to be his wife.

194
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,110
Yeah.

195
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:17,840
Where is Baozi?

196
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:26,960
Stop looking.

197
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,000
Let me see.

198
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:28,760
Don't push!

199
00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:31,440
How stupid you are!

200
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:32,440
Just close

201
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:33,840
the door!

202
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,110
Let me see!

203
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:39,520
Wait! No!

204
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:40,320
You're a girl.

205
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,280
Stop going forward.

206
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,200
It's improper for you to look.

207
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,280
I wanna see it.

208
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,110
Lift me up.

209
00:13:44,110 --> 00:13:44,790
No, no!

210
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,880
Brother, lift me up.

211
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,200
Do it now. Quick.

212
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:49,400
Be careful.

213
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:51,320
Come on. One, two, three.

214
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:57,760
Everyone wanna see the corpse?

215
00:13:59,110 --> 00:13:59,910
Well then.

216
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:05,590
Baozi. Baozi!

217
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:08,350
Baozi!

218
00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:10,400
His face

219
00:14:11,710 --> 00:14:13,230
was destroyed.

220
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,470
What's wrong? Baozi?

221
00:14:18,110 --> 00:14:19,470
Shu.

222
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:22,230
His face is rotten!

223
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:24,670
It's okay.

224
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,440
We better not see the corpse.

225
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:27,880
You may have nightmares at night.

226
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:29,710
I told you not to see it.

227
00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:31,280
But you... It's alright.

228
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:32,440
Don't feel scared, okay?

229
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:33,550
I was wondering

230
00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:35,200
why I didn't see anyone
in the Yamen today.

231
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,200
Turns out you're all here.

232
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:39,910
Stop looking. Just leave!

233
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,280
It's alright. Stop crying.

234
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:46,320
Your Honor.

235
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:49,320
Come with me.

236
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:51,320
[Mortuary]

237
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:52,640
Mr. Xu.

238
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:53,350
Your Honor.

239
00:14:53,710 --> 00:14:54,710
What have you found from the autopsy?

240
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:56,790
Your Honor,

241
00:14:57,350 --> 00:14:58,280
it is a man,

242
00:14:59,150 --> 00:15:00,790
with muddy droplets
in his mouth and nose.

243
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:06,760
His hands curl,

244
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:08,640
with silt and bits of wood
between his fingers.

245
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:09,790
Water is in his stomach

246
00:15:10,030 --> 00:15:11,030
that is swollen.

247
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:13,030
I confirm he died from drowning.

248
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:20,760
When did he drown?

249
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:23,520
The skin looks wrinkled and pale.

250
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,230
I reckon he died three days ago.

251
00:15:25,710 --> 00:15:27,080
Any physical characteristics of him

252
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,640
for us to find his identity?

253
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:30,670
His face was eaten off by fish.

254
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,470
Even if his own parents are here,

255
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:33,910
I'm afraid they can't recognize him.

256
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:34,910
How come

257
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:35,760
only the flesh of his face

258
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:36,590
was eaten off

259
00:15:36,590 --> 00:15:37,760
and other flesh of his body is intact?

260
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:38,880
As far as I can gather,

261
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,350
he had had facial trauma
before he died.

262
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:41,760
The exposed flesh

263
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:43,080
could attract more fish.

264
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:47,470
What do you think?

265
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,710
The body has no clothes on.

266
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:53,710
It's unlikely
to be a suicide by drowning

267
00:15:53,710 --> 00:15:54,790
or an accidental fall into the water.

268
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,550
It's likely
that there was

269
00:15:56,710 --> 00:15:58,550
a conflict with someone,

270
00:15:58,590 --> 00:15:59,550
and he was stripped of his clothes

271
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:00,670
and thrown into the water.

272
00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:05,840
That would be attempted murder.

273
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:09,030
How could Shu be a woman?

274
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:12,200
How could Shu be a woman?

275
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,080
No way!

276
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:19,200
Young Master,

277
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,470
you've been thinking about it all day.

278
00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:21,840
You said you saw her

279
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:23,440
wearing embroidered shoes.

280
00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:25,280
What if

281
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:26,840
he is a man

282
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:28,880
and has

283
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,110
the quirk to wear them.

284
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:32,150
Mr. Qi.

285
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,200
Coming.

286
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:38,000
Mr. Qi,

287
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:40,030
you haven't been out all day.

288
00:16:40,030 --> 00:16:41,760
You got frightened yesterday?

289
00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:44,440
Mr. Han asked me

290
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:45,590
to make some food

291
00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:46,710
for you and Miss Luo.

292
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:47,670
Hang on.

293
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:51,910
What did you call Shu?

294
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,110
Miss Luo.

295
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:54,520
Miss Luo?

296
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:55,550
She's a girl,

297
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:56,710
a few years older than me.

298
00:16:56,710 --> 00:16:57,440
I always call her

299
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,030
Miss Luo.

300
00:16:58,030 --> 00:16:59,000
Impossible!

301
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:00,200
How could a woman

302
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,520
be a constable?

303
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:02,880
But she is a woman.

304
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,280
No one knows she's a woman.

305
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:05,520
Everyone in Yamen knows it.

306
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:09,070
Don't you know it?

307
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:13,000
I always thought

308
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,640
he is a sissy.

309
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:17,070
Who is the sissy you mean?

310
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:21,230
Young Master!

311
00:17:21,230 --> 00:17:22,190
How come you're

312
00:17:22,190 --> 00:17:23,000
fainted again?

313
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:23,760
Young Master.

314
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:24,520
Young Master, wake up.

315
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:25,430
What's wrong?

316
00:17:25,430 --> 00:17:26,590
He was fine just now.

317
00:17:26,830 --> 00:17:27,950
Wake up.

318
00:17:27,950 --> 00:17:29,160
Go call a doctor.

319
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:34,920
I'll do it.

320
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,680
No! no need.

321
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,230
I'll take care of him.

322
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:40,280
Don't call the doctor.

323
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:42,950
I stop by to check

324
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:44,070
if he's all right.

325
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:45,470
Since he's fine,

326
00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:46,190
I gotta go.

327
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:47,950
He's in unconscious.

328
00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:48,800
Are you sure he's okay?

329
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:50,160
Feel at ease.

330
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,040
I'm sure of it.

331
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:53,230
Let's go.

332
00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:02,110
Young Master,

333
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,350
why do you faint

334
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:04,310
after seeing Chief Luo?

335
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:06,590
Do I treat

336
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:07,560
girls well?

337
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,590
You're gentle, generous,
and considerate to them.

338
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:11,830
Every girl in Yamen thinks

339
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:13,350
you're well.

340
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:14,000
But I

341
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,230
didn't treat her friendly.

342
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:18,880
You treat her so bad

343
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:20,000
as if she is your foe.

344
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:21,310
In my mind,

345
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:22,350
woman is the most

346
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:23,830
wonderful creature in the world.

347
00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:25,800
They deserve to be more cared.

348
00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:27,000
But now

349
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:29,280
I've found

350
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:29,950
she is a woman unexpectedly.

351
00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:31,710
I'm ashamed to get on with her.

352
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:35,190
It doesn't matter you didn't know it.

353
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:36,760
Besides, Chief Luo

354
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:38,280
isn't petty.

355
00:18:38,470 --> 00:18:40,470
She even came to see you.

356
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,560
Yes, she came.

357
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:46,950
She came to see me?

358
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:48,880
Yeah.

359
00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:52,280
She even came to see me!

360
00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:54,800
So it means a lot.

361
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:56,880
Miss Luo.

362
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:00,760
What?

363
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:01,880
Morning!

364
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:05,430
You better still call me sissy.

365
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:06,520
I'm going to deal with a case.

366
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,470
If you call me Miss Luo,

367
00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:09,830
it'll hinder my work.

368
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:10,590
Handle a case?

369
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:12,590
I was just trying to help you.

370
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:13,230
Look.

371
00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:14,760
I found the body.

372
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:16,000
so I should help you.

373
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:17,590
I solved the case for you last time.

374
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:18,350
How about

375
00:19:18,470 --> 00:19:20,680
you lead the investigation this time?

376
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:22,470
Miss Luo,

377
00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:25,070
it's an exorcism charm

378
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:26,710
I got for you.

379
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:27,520
Please take it.

380
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:31,350
Miss Luo,

381
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:34,230
it's bad luck to see a dead person.

382
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:35,830
I've heard it's a good charm

383
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,680
and can get rid of your bad luck.

384
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,590
Aren't you the one who met a dead man?

385
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,160
You can keep it for yourself.

386
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,430
Don't worry, Miss Luo.

387
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:49,800
I have enough of them.

388
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:56,800
Hi, did strange things

389
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:58,070
happen recently

390
00:19:58,070 --> 00:19:59,230
around here?

391
00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:01,640
Excuse me!

392
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:02,830
Did strange things happen

393
00:20:02,830 --> 00:20:03,760
around this area please?

394
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:06,830
Sir,

395
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,400
did strange things happen
around here lately?

396
00:20:08,590 --> 00:20:09,400
No, no, no.

397
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:11,280
Stop being rude.

398
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:12,560
Let's go.

399
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:13,800
Excuse me,

400
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:14,640
did any strange things

401
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:15,640
happen around here?

402
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:17,400
Strange things?

403
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:18,470
No.

404
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:19,190
Thank you.

405
00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:21,800
No, no.

406
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:22,430
Sir,

407
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:24,560
did strange things

408
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:25,680
happen in this river area lately?

409
00:20:27,230 --> 00:20:28,190
Nothing at all?

410
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:37,560
Officer.

411
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:39,560
I recall

412
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:40,640
a strange

413
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:41,430
thing now.

414
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:43,000
Someone rented my boat

415
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:44,070
bu then never show up.

416
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:45,190
He hasn't even take the deposit back.

417
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:46,280
Who is it?

418
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:47,230
When did this person rent it?

419
00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:49,520
I remember

420
00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:52,190
his name is Feng Erlang.

421
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,520
He came to me at an evening
about three days ago.

422
00:20:54,710 --> 00:20:55,160
He was supposed to

423
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,880
return the boat early the next morning.

424
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,230
But he didn't come

425
00:20:58,230 --> 00:20:58,920
even I waited for him till noon.

426
00:20:59,350 --> 00:21:01,040
Someone saw my boat on the river

427
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:01,950
and told me.

428
00:21:02,310 --> 00:21:03,160
Where is the boat

429
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:03,880
he rented?

430
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:04,950
This one.

431
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:14,400
Be careful.

432
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:18,070
You act strangely.

433
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:19,000
What do you want?

434
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:21,760
I was just trying to help you.

435
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:41,350
Chief Luo.

436
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:42,830
Chief Luo.

437
00:21:45,190 --> 00:21:46,160
I asked all of them

438
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:47,710
but haven't got any clue.

439
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:49,110
Mr. Cai,

440
00:21:49,310 --> 00:21:50,000
check immediately

441
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,070
where Feng Erlang lives.

442
00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:51,950
Feng Erlang?

443
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:53,760
He hired a boat here three days ago.

444
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:55,400
This is probably his hairpin.

445
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,070
Are you sure?

446
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:00,040
Man is rough

447
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:01,680
while woman is delicate.

448
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:03,430
The rough texture of this hairpin

449
00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:04,040
mustn't belong

450
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:05,470
to a woman

451
00:22:05,470 --> 00:22:06,710
but a rough guy.

452
00:22:06,710 --> 00:22:07,680
Do you think so?

453
00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:08,590
Give it back to me.

454
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,430
Coming.

455
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:19,400
Ma'am.

456
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:20,880
Is this Feng Erlang's home?

457
00:22:20,950 --> 00:22:21,470
Yes.

458
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:22,760
Who are you?

459
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:26,230
We're Yamen officers.

460
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:27,710
You're his mother?

461
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:29,560
Yes, I am.

462
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:31,640
What's the matter?

463
00:22:32,190 --> 00:22:33,000
Well...

464
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:34,310
We wanna inquire him

465
00:22:34,310 --> 00:22:35,160
of something.

466
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:36,920
Is he at home?

467
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:38,040
No,

468
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:39,590
he left a few days ago.

469
00:22:39,950 --> 00:22:40,880
Didn't he tell you where he was going

470
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,400
before he left?

471
00:22:42,710 --> 00:22:43,400
He said

472
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:45,160
he went out to work with his manager.

473
00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:46,880
Who's the manager?

474
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:48,470
He's

475
00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:50,520
a shipping manger at the dock.

476
00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:52,310
Erlang works for him there.

477
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:58,310
Well,

478
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,950
what happened to him?

479
00:23:01,430 --> 00:23:02,110
We found a corpse

480
00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:03,280
from a river.

481
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,590
Take it easy.

482
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:06,160
The identity of the dead

483
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:07,430
haven't been confimed.

484
00:23:07,430 --> 00:23:07,950
That's why

485
00:23:07,950 --> 00:23:09,590
we go door to door for investigation.

486
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:12,160
He's not my son.

487
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:13,310
My son is fine.

488
00:23:13,310 --> 00:23:14,160
Not your son.

489
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:15,430
Don't worry, ma'am.

490
00:23:16,310 --> 00:23:17,110
Ma'am,

491
00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:18,520
can we go inside to check

492
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:20,040
Feng Erlang's room?

493
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:21,280
Well...

494
00:23:23,430 --> 00:23:25,040
All right, come.

495
00:24:17,190 --> 00:24:18,000
Ma'am,

496
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:19,590
can we check the cabinet?

497
00:24:21,110 --> 00:24:21,920
Okay.

498
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:40,400
Ma'am,

499
00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:42,400
is it Feng Erlang's?

500
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,230
It's Hongying's stuff.

501
00:24:48,110 --> 00:24:48,470
Her embroider skills

502
00:24:48,470 --> 00:24:49,590
are not good.

503
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:53,430
Who is Hongying?

504
00:24:54,470 --> 00:24:55,310
Her name is Mei Hongying,

505
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:56,830
my former neighbor.

506
00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:19,710
Are you done checking here?

507
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:20,680
Anything else I can help?

508
00:25:22,950 --> 00:25:25,160
Have you seen the hairpin before?

509
00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:28,470
No.

510
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:31,560
Thanks for your time.

511
00:25:32,310 --> 00:25:33,950
If Feng Erlang comes back,

512
00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:35,160
please do tell us.

513
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:37,160
Okay.

514
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,680
I haven't been out of town lately.

515
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,430
Where is Feng Erlang? Is he there?

516
00:25:50,430 --> 00:25:51,880
He quit the job a few days ago.

517
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:52,950
And his wages were settled.

518
00:25:52,950 --> 00:25:53,830
Which day he quit?

519
00:25:54,830 --> 00:25:57,190
About four days ago.

520
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:01,680
Did he say

521
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:02,760
where he was going to?

522
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:03,710
No.

523
00:26:04,430 --> 00:26:05,680
Another two young guys here

524
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:06,760
also wanted to quit yesterday.

525
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:07,520
They might

526
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:08,560
went away with him

527
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:09,560
for making money.

528
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:10,880
Where do the two men live?

529
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:11,880
I'm not sure.

530
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:18,640
Sir,

531
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:19,680
how long had Feng Erlang

532
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:20,350
worked for you?

533
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:22,920
Let me think about it.

534
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:27,680
At least four or five years.

535
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:29,230
He'd been working for me

536
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:30,560
as he was a teenager.

537
00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:34,760
You mean Erlang's family?

538
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:36,710
They fled

539
00:26:36,710 --> 00:26:38,470
from Henan province because of famine.

540
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,830
Their life has been hard.

541
00:26:41,070 --> 00:26:43,110
Erlang's dad passed away early.

542
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:45,640
His mother raised him all by herself,

543
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:46,880
which is difficult.

544
00:26:47,830 --> 00:26:50,280
Erlang is a filial son.

545
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:52,110
Does he have a girlfriend

546
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:53,070
whose name is Mei Hongying?

547
00:26:53,470 --> 00:26:56,000
We lived in the same alley.

548
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:59,110
Hongying and Erlang
were childhood sweethearts.

549
00:26:59,470 --> 00:27:00,680
It's a pity

550
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:03,160
that Hongying's brother
disagreed with their marriage.

551
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:04,160
Go away!

552
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:05,310
Get out.

553
00:27:05,310 --> 00:27:06,830
Get out!

554
00:27:06,830 --> 00:27:07,520
Stay cool.

555
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:08,470
Can we talk it over?

556
00:27:08,470 --> 00:27:09,560
No need!

557
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:11,110
Hongying and Erlang

558
00:27:11,110 --> 00:27:12,640
are a perfect match.

559
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:13,830
Nonsense!

560
00:27:14,470 --> 00:27:15,430
With his lowly status?

561
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:17,110
He doesn't deserve her.

562
00:27:17,830 --> 00:27:18,880
You tell me

563
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:19,950
what I should do

564
00:27:20,110 --> 00:27:21,040
to marry her?

565
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:22,880
I'll talk straight.

566
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:24,830
Mr. Zhang has come to talk

567
00:27:24,830 --> 00:27:26,000
about the bride price.

568
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:27,520
You have to offer

569
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:28,590
more of it.

570
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:29,950
Or you can just give up.

571
00:27:30,430 --> 00:27:31,920
Fine. How much do you want?

572
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,640
At least 200 liang.

573
00:27:35,470 --> 00:27:36,950
If you offer that much,

574
00:27:37,350 --> 00:27:39,000
I can agree with your marriage.

575
00:27:39,430 --> 00:27:40,590
Her brother

576
00:27:40,590 --> 00:27:42,190
wants her to marry a First-Degree Scholar.

577
00:27:42,190 --> 00:27:44,160
Mei Changxiong is a rough guy.

578
00:27:44,230 --> 00:27:45,350
He's made some money and vain.

579
00:27:45,350 --> 00:27:46,190
Dreams to

580
00:27:46,190 --> 00:27:47,920
climb social status.

581
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:48,950
Meng Qiaosheng is

582
00:27:49,310 --> 00:27:51,710
Mei Hongying's teacher.

583
00:27:51,710 --> 00:27:53,920
Hongying has
a relationship with Feng Erlang

584
00:27:54,070 --> 00:27:55,560
while hooks up

585
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:56,560
with Erlang too.

586
00:27:57,470 --> 00:27:58,680
Is Meng Qiaosheng

587
00:27:58,680 --> 00:27:59,800
also young?

588
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:00,830
Yeah.

589
00:28:01,190 --> 00:28:03,040
He has fair skin and gentle.

590
00:28:03,470 --> 00:28:04,400
His finger skin

591
00:28:04,430 --> 00:28:07,310
looks even more fairer than a girl's.

592
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:08,680
That's why

593
00:28:08,710 --> 00:28:09,920
Hongying fell for him.

594
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:11,470
He married

595
00:28:11,470 --> 00:28:13,640
a literate wife first.

596
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:15,590
Yet he even wanted Hongying

597
00:28:15,590 --> 00:28:16,640
to marry a scholar.

598
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:18,470
If his wife's family hadn't declined,

599
00:28:18,470 --> 00:28:19,520
she wouldn't have married him!

600
00:28:19,950 --> 00:28:21,280
You're well-informed.

601
00:28:22,230 --> 00:28:23,640
He's Meng Qiaosheng.

602
00:28:25,310 --> 00:28:26,040
Mr. Meng.

603
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:29,520
Are you gonna have a class for Hongying?

604
00:28:36,070 --> 00:28:37,040
Mei Changxiong

605
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:38,470
cherishes his wife

606
00:28:38,470 --> 00:28:39,920
so dearly

607
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:41,920
as if she's an apple of his eye.

608
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:45,110
Feng Erlang is also stupid.

609
00:28:45,230 --> 00:28:47,070
Hongying has a bad reputation.

610
00:28:47,070 --> 00:28:48,880
But he still loves her

611
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:51,590
and said he could do
whatever it takes to marry her.

612
00:28:55,470 --> 00:28:56,280
This house?

613
00:29:08,430 --> 00:29:09,230
Anyone inside?

614
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:12,160
Anyone inside?

615
00:29:20,590 --> 00:29:21,710
Come on, Shu. I'll help you in.

616
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:27,680
How rude you are!

617
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:38,430
Watch out!

618
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,280
I can protect you.

619
00:29:47,350 --> 00:29:48,160
Who are you?

620
00:29:50,470 --> 00:29:51,400
We are Yamen officers

621
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:52,880
on a case.

622
00:29:52,950 --> 00:29:54,040
Is Meng Qiaosheng inside now?

623
00:29:55,470 --> 00:29:56,350
Louder please.

624
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,880
We are Yamen officers on a case.

625
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,760
Is Meng Qiaosheng inside?

626
00:30:01,350 --> 00:30:02,160
Yamen officers?

627
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:04,880
Meng QiaoSheng?

628
00:30:05,350 --> 00:30:06,710
I don't know.

629
00:30:06,710 --> 00:30:07,760
What happened to him?

630
00:30:09,070 --> 00:30:10,520
He's related to a case.

631
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:11,470
I beg your pardon?

632
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:14,520
He's related to a case.

633
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:16,430
A case?

634
00:30:16,430 --> 00:30:17,070
Yeah.

635
00:30:17,590 --> 00:30:18,830
What's your relationship with him?

636
00:30:19,430 --> 00:30:20,710
I'm his landlord.

637
00:30:21,230 --> 00:30:23,310
He rents one of my rooms

638
00:30:23,310 --> 00:30:24,110
over there.

639
00:30:24,590 --> 00:30:26,230
When was the last time you saw him?

640
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:30,040
I went to collect his rent
the day before yesterday.

641
00:30:30,710 --> 00:30:32,040
But I didn't see him.

642
00:30:32,710 --> 00:30:33,880
How about his family circumstances?

643
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:36,830
How about his family circumstances?

644
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:41,110
He's a poor scholar.

645
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:42,520
He hasn't passed the imperial exams,

646
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:43,920
but keeps taking them.

647
00:30:44,070 --> 00:30:45,880
He didn't make any money

648
00:30:45,950 --> 00:30:46,830
but has served as a teacher

649
00:30:46,830 --> 00:30:48,280
since last year.

650
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:49,590
Now he has wages.

651
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:54,000
Have you seen the hairpin before?

652
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:58,830
It belongs to him.

653
00:30:59,000 --> 00:30:59,590
Sir,

654
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:00,920
check carefully

655
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:01,880
and tell us.

656
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:04,280
He said you have to check carefully.

657
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:06,920
Rest assured. I can confirm.

658
00:31:08,230 --> 00:31:10,640
He used to wear the peachwood hairpin.

659
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:13,560
He's good-looking

660
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:15,310
and vain.

661
00:31:15,310 --> 00:31:17,190
He usually spends a lot of time

662
00:31:17,190 --> 00:31:18,310
dressing up well

663
00:31:18,310 --> 00:31:19,470
before going out.

664
00:31:20,470 --> 00:31:21,350
It's no surprise

665
00:31:21,350 --> 00:31:22,640
that he never

666
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,680
passed the exams.

667
00:31:26,230 --> 00:31:27,590
Looks like it's him.

668
00:31:29,230 --> 00:31:30,560
Can we go take a look inside?

669
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:33,000
We wanna go in to take a look.

670
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:34,710
Okay.

671
00:31:34,710 --> 00:31:36,160
Please come in.

672
00:31:37,070 --> 00:31:37,800
I'll protect you.

673
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,160
It's a good dog

674
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:42,160
and doesn't attack people.

675
00:31:50,190 --> 00:31:51,000
What are you doing?

676
00:31:51,710 --> 00:31:52,520
I'm looking for evidence

677
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:53,520
as you found the sachet

678
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:54,590
at Feng Erlang's bed just now.

679
00:32:10,430 --> 00:32:11,110
Found it!

680
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:15,680
Look!

681
00:32:15,710 --> 00:32:16,520
What book is that?

682
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:18,680
I have the book too.

683
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:19,590
Obviously,

684
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:20,950
Meng Qiaosheng

685
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:21,950
isn't an honest man!

686
00:32:22,350 --> 00:32:23,230
It's just a book.

687
00:32:23,230 --> 00:32:24,070
Why do you say that?

688
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:25,800
Obviously,

689
00:32:25,830 --> 00:32:27,190
Mr. Qi

690
00:32:27,190 --> 00:32:28,590
isn't an honest man either.

691
00:32:30,190 --> 00:32:32,470
I'm honest, okay?

692
00:32:32,950 --> 00:32:34,280
Let's find more evidence.

693
00:32:42,590 --> 00:32:45,190
Missing you
and recalling our past for so long.

694
00:32:45,310 --> 00:32:47,470
Yearning to see you here every day.

695
00:32:47,830 --> 00:32:49,880
Had I known separation
could make me so sad,

696
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,040
I would have hoped we never met before.

697
00:32:56,470 --> 00:32:58,470
I found it. It's a great one.

698
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:00,070
Look at its!

699
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:07,880
The material of this sachet

700
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:09,430
is the same as that of Feng Erlang's.

701
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:11,430
But the embroidery work is worlds apart.

702
00:33:12,710 --> 00:33:15,350
So is

703
00:33:15,350 --> 00:33:16,160
Mei Hongying

704
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:17,400
a two-timing girl?

705
00:33:21,110 --> 00:33:22,070
Judging from the embroidery,

706
00:33:22,070 --> 00:33:23,430
she loves Meng Qiaosheng more.

707
00:33:23,430 --> 00:33:24,280
Then why does

708
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:25,560
she still date Feng Erlang?

709
00:33:31,950 --> 00:33:32,760
I know it!

710
00:33:33,710 --> 00:33:34,680
I've found the answer.

711
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:38,110
Why do you say that?

712
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:40,350
It must be

713
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:42,160
that Meng Qiaosheng and Feng Erlang

714
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:44,400
fought over Mei Hongying
out of jealousy,

715
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:46,190
and arranged to duel on the boat.

716
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:54,000
Then Erlang got Qiaosheng...

717
00:33:56,110 --> 00:33:57,000
Killed?

718
00:33:57,190 --> 00:33:57,880
Exactly.

719
00:33:59,350 --> 00:34:01,110
But why was he found
without any clothes on?

720
00:34:04,950 --> 00:34:05,830
It's getting late.

721
00:34:05,830 --> 00:34:06,680
Let's go report the work back to Yamen.

722
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:08,430
Wait.

723
00:34:08,430 --> 00:34:09,080
Wait please.

724
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:09,600
Well,

725
00:34:10,190 --> 00:34:10,840
Mr. Cai,

726
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:12,520
how far is Deyilou Resturant from here?

727
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:14,470
Are you wanna buy me liquor?

728
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:16,560
Miss Luo, I didn't treat you nicely.

729
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:18,520
How about I invite you to a dinner
to make up to you?

730
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:19,950
Let's get loaded tonight.

731
00:34:19,950 --> 00:34:20,390
Wonderful!

732
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:22,430
I'm not hungry.
I've to deal with the case.

733
00:34:22,430 --> 00:34:23,190
Don't leave.

734
00:34:23,670 --> 00:34:24,840
You'll feel hungry after going there later.

735
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:25,470
Yeah.

736
00:34:25,470 --> 00:34:27,000
You said you're gonna help me.

737
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:27,840
Yet you stop me from going back?

738
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:28,470
I...

739
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:31,360
You...

740
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:35,000
Okay. It's up to you.

741
00:34:56,950 --> 00:34:57,710
Your Honor.

742
00:34:57,710 --> 00:34:58,470
You're back.

743
00:34:59,150 --> 00:35:00,520
Captain Cai, Mr. Qi

744
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:01,520
and I were

745
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:02,190
on the case today.

746
00:35:02,190 --> 00:35:02,870
You can report it later.

747
00:35:03,630 --> 00:35:04,520
Have you had supper yet?

748
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:06,360
Not yet.

749
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:07,910
I didn't have it either.

750
00:35:08,390 --> 00:35:09,560
Let's have the meal
and talk about the case.

751
00:35:11,230 --> 00:35:11,470
Okay.

752
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:12,430
Let's go.

753
00:35:16,230 --> 00:35:17,000
We deduced

754
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,360
the dead is Meng Qiaosheng.

755
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:19,040
The murderer is Feng Erlang,

756
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:20,560
who left the boat and fled.

757
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:21,600
He killed Meng Qiaosheng

758
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:23,040
may be because they were rivals in love.

759
00:35:23,190 --> 00:35:24,600
But these are just the results we deduced.

760
00:35:24,670 --> 00:35:25,950
We still need to seek Feng Erlang out

761
00:35:25,950 --> 00:35:26,870
to find out the truth.

762
00:35:27,630 --> 00:35:28,950
I can let my men

763
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:30,080
to seek for him in the whole town.

764
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:31,630
Le's go in.

765
00:35:32,430 --> 00:35:33,390
Young Master, slow down.

766
00:35:33,390 --> 00:35:34,760
Young Master.

767
00:35:35,630 --> 00:35:36,760
Be careful, okay?

768
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:38,120
Why so rush?

769
00:35:38,150 --> 00:35:38,840
Can you stop

770
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:39,870
being careless?

771
00:35:39,870 --> 00:35:40,950
The dishes were nearly dropped.

772
00:35:41,950 --> 00:35:43,670
Look what you did, Young Master.

773
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:44,430
You ordered

774
00:35:44,430 --> 00:35:45,710
so many dishes for Chief Luo

775
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:47,040
that I can barely take them.

776
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:48,600
Isn't it a waste of money?

777
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:50,000
Stop being a miser, okay?

778
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:52,080
Young Master.

779
00:35:53,470 --> 00:35:55,230
You treat her so well suddenly.

780
00:35:55,230 --> 00:35:56,360
She might suspect

781
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:57,320
your motives.

782
00:35:57,670 --> 00:35:58,910
Well, what do you know!

783
00:35:59,430 --> 00:36:00,800
I'm going straight

784
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:01,710
and to make up with her.

785
00:36:02,190 --> 00:36:03,000
Can you

786
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,360
be generous to the food?

787
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:18,520
No soup?

788
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:20,840
Are all of them overcooked?

789
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,040
The soup is the one in the middle

790
00:36:25,470 --> 00:36:26,520
but boiled away.

791
00:36:27,910 --> 00:36:28,670
But it's not

792
00:36:28,670 --> 00:36:30,230
my fault.

793
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:32,230
You'd been delaying the dinner.

794
00:36:32,470 --> 00:36:33,870
I was worried the soup would get cold

795
00:36:33,870 --> 00:36:34,870
and heated it up many times.

796
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:36,230
But it was boiled away.

797
00:36:37,950 --> 00:36:38,670
Now Miss Luo

798
00:36:38,670 --> 00:36:39,760
has come back.

799
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:40,910
The two of you
can have the dinner together.

800
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:48,630
Here are the dishes of Deyilou Resturant.

801
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:53,520
You're having the dinner.

802
00:36:58,280 --> 00:36:59,710
But they're overcooked!

803
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:00,910
Never mind.

804
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:02,670
I have more.

805
00:37:02,710 --> 00:37:03,800
Mr. Qi, no need to do that.

806
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:05,910
It's okay. Don't worry.

807
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:12,230
Mr. Qi,

808
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:13,280
there are so many dishes.

809
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:13,710
I don't think

810
00:37:13,710 --> 00:37:15,000
Miss Luo

811
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:16,600
can eat them up.

812
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:17,670
Yeah, right.

813
00:37:17,670 --> 00:37:18,600
For these dishes,

814
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:19,840
we can call the others to eat with us.

815
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:20,910
Is it okay, Your Honor?

816
00:37:21,910 --> 00:37:22,710
Okay.

817
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:24,390
I'll call them to come.

818
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:27,080
If I had known you wanted
to treat everyone dinner,

819
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:28,000
I would have invited

820
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:28,840
the cook of Deyilou Restaurant here.

821
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:41,040
Here.

822
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:46,280
Have some duck.

823
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:52,430
I can do it myself.

824
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:09,040
Your Honor,

825
00:38:09,910 --> 00:38:11,710
didn't you say you wanted soup?

826
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:44,280
Woman's body
is usually weaker than a man's.

827
00:38:45,230 --> 00:38:46,040
Come on.

828
00:38:46,910 --> 00:38:48,470
Have some chicken soup for nourishment.

829
00:39:01,430 --> 00:39:03,150
Mr. Chen, dig up.

830
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:04,150
The dishes

831
00:39:04,150 --> 00:39:05,320
will go to waste
if we can't finish them.

832
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:06,320
It'll be terrible.

833
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:13,800
Are you done checking here?

834
00:39:14,230 --> 00:39:15,040
Anything else I can help?

835
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:16,120
Thanks for your time.

836
00:39:21,470 --> 00:39:22,280
I get it.

837
00:39:23,230 --> 00:39:24,280
Poor family

838
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:25,840
wouldn't waste the food.

839
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:27,950
You've realized something?

840
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:29,800
The Feng family

841
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:31,080
is poor.

842
00:39:31,390 --> 00:39:32,150
They weren't supposed

843
00:39:32,150 --> 00:39:33,760
to waste the food.

844
00:39:34,230 --> 00:39:35,840
But we saw Feng Erlang's mother

845
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,470
cooked a lot of food today.

846
00:39:38,910 --> 00:39:40,630
You mean Feng Erlang was in hiding

847
00:39:40,630 --> 00:39:42,040
and his mother was gonna bring him food?

848
00:39:42,150 --> 00:39:42,710
What's more,

849
00:39:42,710 --> 00:39:44,150
when we questioned her today,

850
00:39:44,230 --> 00:39:45,630
she was nervous.

851
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:48,320
Looks like we can find Feng Erlang

852
00:39:48,390 --> 00:39:49,760
if we keep an eye on his mother.

853
00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:52,280
I'll go with you!

854
00:40:16,430 --> 00:40:18,390
You came before.

855
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:20,080
Why are you here again?

856
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:24,390
Ma'am,

857
00:40:25,390 --> 00:40:26,760
we've confirmed

858
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:28,430
the dead isn't Feng Erlang.

859
00:40:31,710 --> 00:40:33,150
But he's suspected of murder.

860
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:38,320
Never will he kill anyone.

861
00:40:38,710 --> 00:40:40,950
You must be mistaken.

862
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:42,230
Don't worry.

863
00:40:42,630 --> 00:40:44,560
All we have to do now is to find him

864
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:46,000
and let him explain everything.

865
00:40:46,470 --> 00:40:47,630
But if we can't find him,

866
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:49,760
it'll get more serious.

867
00:40:49,950 --> 00:40:51,360
More serious?

868
00:40:51,870 --> 00:40:52,670
Ma'am,

869
00:40:53,710 --> 00:40:54,800
if he becomes a fugitive,

870
00:40:54,870 --> 00:40:56,630
Yamen will issue wanted posters

871
00:40:56,630 --> 00:40:57,600
to hunt him down.

872
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:59,230
Then he've to get harsher punishment.

873
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:00,840
Well.

874
00:41:00,950 --> 00:41:02,230
If you see him,

875
00:41:02,470 --> 00:41:03,800
please ask him to come to Yamen

876
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:04,910
and tell us what happened.

877
00:41:05,230 --> 00:41:06,950
It's the only way to save him.

878
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:09,910
Thanks for your time.

879
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:27,910
Will she come out for what you said?

880
00:41:28,230 --> 00:41:29,040
Let's wait and see.

881
00:41:36,150 --> 00:41:37,000
She came out.

882
00:42:31,950 --> 00:42:32,760
Erlang.

883
00:42:34,470 --> 00:42:35,280
Erlang.

884
00:42:35,630 --> 00:42:36,840
It's me. Open the door.

885
00:42:37,150 --> 00:42:37,950
Erlang.

886
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:39,950
Open the door, Erlang.

887
00:42:39,950 --> 00:42:40,600
Mother.

888
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:42,000
Open the door. It's me.

889
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:46,910
Let's go.

890
00:42:48,430 --> 00:42:49,870
You have delivered
the food this morning.

891
00:42:49,870 --> 00:42:51,950
Tell me the truth.

892
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:53,320
Did you kill someone?

893
00:42:53,470 --> 00:42:54,230
What?

894
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:56,600
The Yamen officers
came to ask you again?

895
00:42:56,670 --> 00:42:58,430
Tell me what really happened.
