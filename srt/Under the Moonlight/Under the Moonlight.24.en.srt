[Adapted from the novel
"Jin Nang" by Shui He]

00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:33,020
[Episode 24]

4
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:38,480
Yulan,

5
00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:40,550
you should have told me
that you're back in Taiyuan.

6
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:48,080
Qin, you still look so dignified.

7
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,510
Haven't seen you in a while.

8
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:52,400
I've heard that you've become

9
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,590
the Deputy Commandant in Linfen

10
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:54,760
and have made brilliant achievements.

11
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,000
Qin, you flatter me.

12
00:01:56,230 --> 00:01:57,040
Qin,

13
00:01:57,190 --> 00:01:58,400
are you here to see Yanjin?

14
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:01,720
I have something to discuss with Yanjin.

15
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,360
I'll visit you another day.

16
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:14,360
You know the richest man in Taiyuan?

17
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:16,670
Why did he call you Yulan?

18
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:25,830
Is he close to your family?

19
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:27,880
He and Yanjin

20
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,110
have been friends for many years.

21
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:30,190
He comes here a lot.

22
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:32,670
The way he talked to you,

23
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,080
it seems he is your old acquaintance.

24
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:37,360
What is your relationship with him?

25
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:39,880
I knew him before I ended up

26
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:40,830
in Mingke House.

27
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:42,550
Every time he goes to Linfen,

28
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:43,670
he visits me.

29
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:45,800
Did he give you

30
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,360
all that money?

31
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:50,000
Does he have

32
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,030
other intentions towards you?

33
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:52,750
I got the money from somewhere else.

34
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:53,630
It has nothing to do with him.

35
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,110
Go back. You don't need to see me off.

36
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:57,000
I'm just walking around.

37
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:13,670
Yanjin.

38
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,470
Qin, make yourself comfortable.

39
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:22,800
Yanjin,

40
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:25,270
you've been really busy lately.

41
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,390
The closer it gets to the New Year,

42
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:29,190
the busier I am.

43
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:30,750
I have to take care of

44
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:32,240
all those household affairs by myself.

45
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,080
I really can't spare any time.

46
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:38,750
So this time I come to see you in person

47
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:39,720
with a humble heart.

48
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:41,910
Spring is approaching,

49
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:44,000
but I haven't got the new salt permit.

50
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,190
I'm truly worried.

51
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,750
You have vast wealth.

52
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:56,750
I'm sure you have plenty of ways
to make money.

53
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:59,190
Why do you care so much

54
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:01,440
about a mere salt permit?

55
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:03,160
Yanjin, don't make fun of me.

56
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,110
We've been

57
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:05,390
doing this business for years.

58
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:07,110
Our families have maintained
a close relationship for many years.

59
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,550
Governor Qi and you

60
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:09,750
have trusted me a lot.

61
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:11,800
And I've been grateful.

62
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,110
That's why we've both

63
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:15,630
built such a fortune in recent years.

64
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,230
That's our foundation.

65
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:19,720
How can we just stop it

66
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,160
without a second thought?

67
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,790
Who would be willing to

68
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:24,350
give up such a profitable business?

69
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:25,000
But right now,

70
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,550
there are so many people watching.

71
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:27,550
One slight mistake,

72
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,480
it would be a disaster for us.

73
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,830
It's better to stop it for a while.

74
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:36,720
I know, but...

75
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,000
You're well-connected.

76
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:39,510
Your business beyond the pass

77
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,600
is booming and successful.

78
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:43,350
Do you really care about
the salt permit?

79
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:50,040
Or could it be that,

80
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,480
because of your business
beyond the pass,

81
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:56,920
you are even more
concerned about the salt permit?

82
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:02,160
Yanjin,

83
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,270
what are you talking about?

84
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:05,070
I just sell

85
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:07,350
some coarse grains and tea,

86
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:09,550
and bring back some leather
and local produce.

87
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:10,790
Those are all

88
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:12,600
small businesses,

89
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,160
not worth mentioning.

90
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:16,790
Have some tea.

91
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:19,040
Okay.

92
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,270
It tastes good.

93
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:30,160
Yanjin,

94
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,200
you know

95
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,920
my character.

96
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,110
I'm the type who fears trouble

97
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:37,550
and wouldn't dare to stir things up.

98
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,200
So I wouldn't do anything

99
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,510
that's explicitly prohibited

100
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,600
by the imperial court.

101
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,070
No matter if you did it or not,

102
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:49,600
it's off the table now.

103
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:53,950
Yanjin,

104
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:56,270
the salt permit is highly profitable.

105
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,790
are you just gonna

106
00:05:57,790 --> 00:05:59,110
let it slip away?

107
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:00,880
After all,

108
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,070
it's always the Qi family
that gets the biggest part,

109
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:04,640
while our Qin family

110
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:06,070
can only have a small portion.

111
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:09,110
Yanjin, help me out this time.

112
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,350
It's Father's decision.

113
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,350
There's nothing I can do.

114
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,200
I know you've also had a hard time.

115
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,440
Over the past ten years,

116
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,440
you've handled

117
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:33,880
every single affair within the family

118
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,720
all by yourself.

119
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:38,320
To be honest,

120
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,230
you're truly better

121
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:41,670
than your other two brothers.

122
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:43,830
If you really have ambitions

123
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:46,600
to covet the position
of head of the Qi family...

124
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:47,920
Qin, watch your words.

125
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:52,790
We are united

126
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:54,440
and share a deep bond as a family.

127
00:06:58,550 --> 00:07:00,160
I was out of line.

128
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:04,600
Please forgive me.

129
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:09,070
Well,

130
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,640
I'll take my leave now.

131
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:13,070
I'll see you around.

132
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,160
You just said

133
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,390
that you had a deep bond.

134
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:31,320
Then you should

135
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,390
take good care of Mr. Menglin.

136
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:35,880
What do you mean?

137
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:39,920
Don't you know?

138
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:42,000
He brought a lady home.

139
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:45,000
That woman is not simple.

140
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,790
I'm just reminding you.

141
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:01,670
Lian Qi.

142
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:04,720
Lian Qi.

143
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:07,760
Mr. Yanjin.

144
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,110
Go find out

145
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,920
what is the background of the woman

146
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,160
that Menglin brought back.

147
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:13,550
Got it.

148
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:21,880
Excuse me,

149
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:22,920
may I ask,

150
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:23,720
do you know

151
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,390
if there's a bun shop nearby

152
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:27,200
with a golden plaque outside?

153
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,000
I don't know.

154
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:18,000
You're back so early.

155
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:19,150
I thought

156
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:20,960
you'd be playing with your friends
till midnight.

157
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:36,550
Your cloak is cold.

158
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,350
It must be freezing outside.

159
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:48,520
Menglin, you're finally back.

160
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:51,150
Is it cold outside? Are you hungry?

161
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,280
Are you drunk?

162
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:12,400
Go change and rest.

163
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:15,710
I'm not drunk.

164
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,350
I felt bored

165
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:18,230
being with them.

166
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:19,960
So I came back to see you.

167
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:25,400
Young Master, here is sobering-up soup.

168
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:32,520
Have some soup.

169
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,080
Where did you go today?

170
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,350
I wanted to go look for the place

171
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:45,550
where I lived when I was a child.

172
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:47,790
But I was too young back then.

173
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,030
I don't remember anything.

174
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:51,470
Not even where the house was.

175
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:53,110
Think carefully.

176
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:54,640
Is there anything

177
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:55,910
stick out in your head?

178
00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:56,710
Such as

179
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:59,080
a well, a tree,

180
00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:00,030
or

181
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,280
a familiar face.

182
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:06,230
I vaguely remember

183
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:09,080
that there was a big, golden plaque

184
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,640
at the entrance of the alley.

185
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:14,200
There was a bun shop at the corner

186
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:15,710
that sold really delicious buns.

187
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,640
My father used to
buy them for me all the time.

188
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:22,760
A golden plaque

189
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:24,320
at the entrance of the alley,

190
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,640
and a delicious bun shop

191
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:26,910

and every shop has a plaque outside.

How can I find it?

197
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,150

that fewer people know

how to make butter pastries?

00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,670

to learn how to make them.

want to eat them all up.

Taste it while it's hot.

242
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:19,350
It won't taste as good when it's cold.

I remember you love sweet food,

244
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,640

the first thing I did

to make it up to me.

even when I offered to redeem you

277
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:33,910

00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:28,880
our estate this year.

383
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:29,950
Really?

384
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:30,800
They're delicious.

385
00:18:36,310 --> 00:18:36,920
Eat while it's hot.

386
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:37,830
Okay.

387
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:40,470
Grandson.

388
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,590
Mother, try this.

389
00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:46,640
This fish is pretty good.

390
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:48,590
Give it to Luo Shu.

391
00:18:50,470 --> 00:18:51,800
I just saw on the table

392
00:18:51,950 --> 00:18:54,070
that the pigeon soup and the duck
are also pretty good.

393
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:55,590
Tell people in the kitchen
to make one more

394
00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:56,230
and send to her.

395
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:57,230
Go.

396
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,110
Wait.

397
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:00,710
Take these meatballs.

398
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:02,350
Give them to Luo Shu.

399
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:03,190
Nobody's watching.

400
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:04,000
Go.

401
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:04,950
Go.

402
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,520
Where's Menglin?

403
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:14,520
Menglin,

404
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:18,310
you look like you've been scared.

405
00:19:18,310 --> 00:19:19,560
What's wrong with you?

406
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:21,520
Everyone's eating.

407
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:22,110
Why are you going there

408
00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:23,000
by yourself?

409
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:24,590
It's New Year's Eve, don't do that.

410
00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:25,880
Eat more, Menglin.

411
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:28,400
Just now, Fengzhou

412
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,400
talked about
his political achievements this year.

413
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,560
Now you're also an official,

414
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:35,350
do you fulfill your duties properly?

415
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:36,470
Tell us.

416
00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:37,920
Everyone wants to hear.

417
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:40,470
Father,

418
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:41,760
why don't you

419
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,110
ask Yanjin first?

420
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:45,760
He is not an official.

421
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
I'm asking you now.

422
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:51,920
Alright then.

423
00:19:56,190 --> 00:19:57,000
Father,

424
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,880
I really achieved something

425
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,160
as the Deputy Commandant of Pingyangwei.

426
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:03,350
In addition to leading troops
to suppress bandits,

427
00:20:03,350 --> 00:20:04,640
I've solved several major cases.

428
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,070
I'm telling you,

429
00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:08,110
those bandits,

430
00:20:08,110 --> 00:20:09,070
each more fierce than the next.

431
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:11,280
I fought them off

432
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,040
repeatedly.

433
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,760
I almost lost my life.

434
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:15,880
You're just

435
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:17,560
talking nonsense.

436
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:18,760
I'm not lying.

437
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:20,310
If you don't believe me,

438
00:20:20,310 --> 00:20:21,560
you can go check the files.

439
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:23,350
It's all written in the files.

440
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,520
I've been injured several times.

441
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,040
You... You've....

442
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:28,920
My dear.

443
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,760
Come here, come to your grandmother.

444
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,560
Where were you injured?

445
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:34,400
My dear grandson.

446
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,710
Grandmother, I'm fine now.

447
00:20:35,710 --> 00:20:37,070
I have to protect myself.

448
00:20:37,190 --> 00:20:38,350
I have to show filial piety to you.

449
00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:40,000
How could I not have known about this?

450
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,680
Why didn't you tell me?

451
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,470
Look at him.

452
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:46,710
After the New Year,

453
00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:47,950
I'll deal with you.

454
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,430
He said he'd deal with me.

455
00:20:54,350 --> 00:20:55,800
You, you don't do that.

456
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:56,640
Look at him.

457
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:57,160
Come on.

458
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:58,190
Sit down and eat more.

459
00:20:58,190 --> 00:20:58,800
Sit down.

460
00:20:59,160 --> 00:20:59,680
Come on.

461
00:21:00,190 --> 00:21:01,800
Let's eat.

462
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:03,400
Good.

463
00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:13,710
Beside the lakeside rocks,

464
00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:27,680
I will unfasten your buttons and belt.

465
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,310
I'll go back to my room first,

466
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:30,680
and then,

467
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:33,110
you sit here and cover for me.

468
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:34,560
I sit here?

469
00:21:38,350 --> 00:21:38,950
Sit.

470
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:40,520
Sit.

471
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:51,280
Yanjin.

472
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,190
Yanjin.

473
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:54,160
Where are you going
without watching the opera?

474
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:55,710
It's boring.

475
00:21:55,710 --> 00:21:56,710
I'm going back.

476
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:01,190
To see that woman surnamed Luo?

477
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:03,230
How do you know?

478
00:22:04,070 --> 00:22:05,680
Do you know her true identity?

479
00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:08,880
I do.

480
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:09,760
You do?

481
00:22:10,350 --> 00:22:11,400
Do you know

482
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,000
why she approached you?

483
00:22:12,190 --> 00:22:12,920
Yanjin.

484
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:14,470
Don't be so paranoid.

485
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:15,560
She's not who you think she is.

486
00:22:16,230 --> 00:22:16,920
I'm going back.

487
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,400
Go to watch the opera.

488
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,070
Bye.

Just tell her.

I'm flying the kite.

588
00:26:12,430 --> 00:26:13,590
I'm flying the kite.

589
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:15,430
I'm flying the kite.

590
00:26:15,430 --> 00:26:18,040
It's flying.

591
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:19,590
It's flying.

592
00:26:19,590 --> 00:26:21,110
Who flies a kite in the winter?

593
00:26:21,350 --> 00:26:22,070
Come here.

594
00:26:22,070 --> 00:26:22,950
You'll catch a cold.

595
00:26:22,950 --> 00:26:24,800
No, I want to fly the kite.

596
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:27,040
It's flying.

597
00:26:28,310 --> 00:26:29,110
It's flying.

598
00:26:29,110 --> 00:26:30,070
Come on, let her play.

599
00:26:30,070 --> 00:26:32,160
I'm flying the kite.

600
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:32,830
It's flying.

601
00:26:32,830 --> 00:26:33,950
Be careful.

602
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:36,830
I'm flying the kite.

603
00:26:37,950 --> 00:26:38,760
Excuse me,

604
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:42,920
why are you crying?

605
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:47,560
Excuse me,

606
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:51,590
who are you?

607
00:26:52,470 --> 00:26:53,230
Sorry for disturbing.

608
00:26:54,110 --> 00:26:55,190
I once lived here

609
00:26:55,190 --> 00:26:56,470
when I was young.

610
00:26:57,590 --> 00:26:58,920
If it's convenient,

611
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:00,880
can I take a look inside?

612
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:03,710
Sure.

613
00:27:37,470 --> 00:27:39,000
After that great fire,

614
00:27:41,430 --> 00:27:42,920
my home was lost.

615
00:27:45,350 --> 00:27:46,160
Great fire?

616
00:27:47,190 --> 00:27:48,110
What fire?

617
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:51,000
I can't remember the things

618
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,710
when I was young.

619
00:27:54,830 --> 00:27:56,230
But that night,

620
00:27:58,280 --> 00:27:59,920
I'll never forget.

621
00:28:00,110 --> 00:28:01,190
Here, daughter,

622
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:02,760
your favorite roasted chicken.

623
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:03,950
I want the drumstick.

624
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:04,830
Alright.

625
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:06,590
Here, take it.

626
00:28:09,310 --> 00:28:10,110
You eat too.

627
00:28:10,110 --> 00:28:10,800
Okay.

628
00:28:10,950 --> 00:28:12,430
I want this.

629
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:13,680
Here.

630
00:28:14,430 --> 00:28:15,710
I want another drumstick.

631
00:28:15,710 --> 00:28:16,190
Slow down.

632
00:28:16,190 --> 00:28:16,920
No,

633
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:18,280
you can't eat that much at night.

634
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:19,640
You'll feel uncomfortable.

635
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:20,470
No.

636
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:24,760
Listen to your mother,
you can eat tomorrow.

637
00:28:28,310 --> 00:28:29,160
How does it taste?

638
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:52,950
Father. Mother.

639
00:29:57,110 --> 00:29:58,230
Father.

640
00:30:02,710 --> 00:30:03,950
Mother.

641
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:08,710
Father.

642
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:11,070
Mother.

643
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,110
Father.

644
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:50,590
It's here.

645
00:30:53,230 --> 00:30:54,310
It's still here.

646
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:00,710
Come on, stand up straight.

647
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:04,190
One foot.

648
00:31:05,710 --> 00:31:06,590
Two feet.

649
00:31:07,950 --> 00:31:09,000
Three feet.

650
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:13,830
My daughter is already four feet tall.

651
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:16,800
I'm gonna mark this for you.

652
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:22,430
Don't move.

653
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:35,470
This...

654
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:38,830
My father marked it for me.

655
00:31:42,350 --> 00:31:43,470
Don't be sad.

656
00:31:44,350 --> 00:31:45,760
You should be happy.

657
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:47,040
You're right.

658
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:49,760
I should be happy.

659
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:54,190
Excuse me,

660
00:31:55,110 --> 00:31:55,920
do you sell this pillar?

661
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:56,520
How much?

662
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:57,280
Name your price.

663
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:57,920
Well...

664
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:58,680
Father,

665
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:01,560
will the house collapse
if we sell the pillar?

666
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:02,280
It...

667
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:05,830
Stop it.

668
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:07,560
I'm not playing around.

669
00:32:08,710 --> 00:32:09,710
This is the only trace

670
00:32:09,710 --> 00:32:10,680
left by you and your parents.

671
00:32:11,190 --> 00:32:12,710
I wanted to keep it.

672
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:15,110
No need.

673
00:32:16,230 --> 00:32:17,470
I'm already satisfied

674
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:20,040
to revisit here.

675
00:32:21,830 --> 00:32:22,680
Thank you.

676
00:32:41,590 --> 00:32:42,520
Mrs. Guo?

677
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:43,800
Luo?

678
00:32:44,350 --> 00:32:45,160
Mrs. Guo.

679
00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:46,590
You saved me back then,

680
00:32:46,590 --> 00:32:48,000
but why did you

681
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,000
rush to send me away?

682
00:32:51,190 --> 00:32:53,560
That's a long story.

683
00:32:55,110 --> 00:32:57,190
It was raining so heavily that night.

684
00:32:57,830 --> 00:32:59,950
But the rain couldn't put out the fire.

685
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:02,920
It was raining that night?

686
00:33:04,830 --> 00:33:06,680
We saw your house was on fire.

687
00:33:06,830 --> 00:33:08,520
All the neighbors came out

688
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:09,710
trying to put out the fire.

689
00:33:10,190 --> 00:33:12,160
The rain started to fall,

690
00:33:12,830 --> 00:33:14,230
getting heavier and heavier.

691
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:15,830
We all thought

692
00:33:16,110 --> 00:33:19,280
that the rain would surely
put out the fire.

693
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:20,950
Unexpectedly,

694
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:23,190
it grew even fiercer.

695
00:33:24,710 --> 00:33:27,350
I've never seen a fire

696
00:33:27,350 --> 00:33:29,760
that rain couldn't put out in my life.

697
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:33,560
My husband rescued you from the fire.

698
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:35,070
You were unconscious

699
00:33:35,070 --> 00:33:37,190
for a whole day and night.

700
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:41,160
We had originally planned

701
00:33:41,470 --> 00:33:43,280
to raise you up

702
00:33:43,710 --> 00:33:45,110
no matter how hard our life was.

703
00:33:46,350 --> 00:33:48,070
But just a few days after the fire,

704
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:49,830
he encountered some strange people

705
00:33:49,830 --> 00:33:51,800
at the entrance of the alley.

706
00:33:52,190 --> 00:33:52,920
They inquired about

707
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:54,470
the fire situation

708
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:57,310
and asked if anyone had survived.

709
00:33:58,920 --> 00:33:59,920
Who were they?

710
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:05,920
We didn't know them.

711
00:34:07,230 --> 00:34:08,870
My husband and I figured

712
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:11,560
they would eventually find us,

713
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:13,840
so we secretly took you out of the town,

714
00:34:14,390 --> 00:34:16,360
and entrusted you to his cousin.

715
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,710
But less than a month later,

716
00:34:19,150 --> 00:34:20,560
we were told that

717
00:34:21,190 --> 00:34:22,840
you were lost.

718
00:34:31,950 --> 00:34:34,080
Luo,

719
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:36,600
is this your husband?

720
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:40,150
When did you get married?

721
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:42,560
We...

722
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:43,910
We do have plans,

723
00:34:44,230 --> 00:34:45,470
but we haven't got engaged yet.

724
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:47,080
When we set a date,

725
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:48,430
We'll invite you to our wedding banquet.

726
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:50,120
Sure.

727
00:34:51,670 --> 00:34:52,910
When you get married,

728
00:34:52,910 --> 00:34:55,040
my husband and I will definitely

729
00:34:55,150 --> 00:34:56,560
go to your wedding.

730
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:57,520
Yeah.

731
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:03,080
You're quite handsome,

732
00:35:04,190 --> 00:35:05,950
worthy of you.

733
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:09,080
Don't worry, Mrs. Guo.

734
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:09,840
Even if she wanted a star,

735
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:10,670
I would pick it down for her.

736
00:35:14,470 --> 00:35:15,190
Mrs. Guo,

737
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:17,120
I'll come to visit another day.

738
00:35:17,910 --> 00:35:20,360
Luo, stay for a meal.

739
00:35:20,630 --> 00:35:21,430
No,

740
00:35:21,710 --> 00:35:23,560
I'll visit you and Mr. Guo another day.

741
00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:27,080
Take care, Mrs. Guo.

742
00:35:31,710 --> 00:35:32,870
Where are you going?

743
00:35:33,710 --> 00:35:34,630
Water couldn't put out the fire.

744
00:35:34,630 --> 00:35:35,870
It burned even fiercer.

745
00:35:36,710 --> 00:35:37,520
Unless...

746
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:38,670
Is there

747
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:39,800
any special material in the fire?

748
00:35:39,910 --> 00:35:42,040
And why did strangers

749
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:43,080
inquire about the situation

750
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:43,950
after the fire?

751
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:46,430
I want to get to the bottom of this.

752
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:47,760
I can't let my parents

753
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:48,870
die without clarity.

754
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:49,710
Of course.

755
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:51,230
I'll investigate with you.

756
00:35:54,670 --> 00:35:55,470
But it's been

757
00:35:55,470 --> 00:35:56,520
so many years.

758
00:35:56,710 --> 00:35:57,710
What are you afraid of?

759
00:35:58,150 --> 00:35:58,840
Didn't you

760
00:35:58,840 --> 00:35:59,950
solve all those

761
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:00,670
previous cases

762
00:36:00,670 --> 00:36:01,760
that were clueless?

763
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:03,230
You'll solve this one too.

764
00:36:04,950 --> 00:36:05,760
So,

765
00:36:05,950 --> 00:36:07,000
where should we start?

766
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,080
I remember

767
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:11,230
there was a strong

768
00:36:11,230 --> 00:36:12,470
burnt smell.

769
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:14,600
It was very distinctive.

770
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:16,840
I can never forget it.

771
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:19,470
Bring out

772
00:36:19,470 --> 00:36:20,280
all the fuels in your shop.

773
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:21,120
We want to burn them.

774
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:22,390
Didn't you say

775
00:36:22,390 --> 00:36:23,430
you remembered that burnt smell?

776
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:24,840
Let's smell each one of them,

777
00:36:24,910 --> 00:36:25,600
and we'll find it.

778
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:44,080
The variety in your shop is incomplete.

779
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:45,470
We have all the common stuff

780
00:36:45,470 --> 00:36:46,430
on the market.

781
00:36:46,910 --> 00:36:48,360
If you're looking for something rare,

782
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:49,190
I don't have it.

783
00:36:51,390 --> 00:36:53,080
It's okay. We'll keep looking.

784
00:36:53,710 --> 00:36:54,560
Okay.

785
00:36:55,230 --> 00:36:56,040
Goodbye.

786
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:57,150
Thanks.

787
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:11,950
I'm sorry.

788
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:13,670
Let's go.

789
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:18,760
[Closed]
Let's check other shops.

790
00:37:25,670 --> 00:37:27,840
Excuse me.

791
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:28,840
Please wait.

792
00:37:29,430 --> 00:37:30,430
What's wrong?

793
00:37:30,630 --> 00:37:32,080
I just remembered a guy.

794
00:37:32,230 --> 00:37:33,120
His shop

795
00:37:33,230 --> 00:37:34,560
might have what you're looking for.

796
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:38,120
This is the petroleum.

797
00:37:38,430 --> 00:37:39,470
Please take a look.

798
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:47,280
Mr. Zhang,

799
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:48,710
can you pour some out

800
00:37:48,710 --> 00:37:49,520
for me to burn?

801
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,430
I'm afraid I can't.

802
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:53,670
I only have a little bit left,

803
00:37:53,670 --> 00:37:54,870
and it's already been ordered.

804
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:55,870
By whom?

805
00:37:55,950 --> 00:37:56,870
How much did he pay?

806
00:37:59,230 --> 00:38:00,080
Is this enough?

807
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:01,430
It's not about the money.

808
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:03,630
This is hard to come by.

809
00:38:03,910 --> 00:38:06,120
It was specially ordered
by my regular customer.

810
00:38:06,190 --> 00:38:07,840
I had to pull a lot of strings

811
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:09,320
to get it.

812
00:38:09,430 --> 00:38:10,560
If I give it to you,

813
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:12,190
I won't be able to explain to him.

814
00:38:16,870 --> 00:38:18,430
Zhang,

815
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:19,320
listen.

816
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:20,190
It's still a while

817
00:38:20,190 --> 00:38:21,000
before the New Year is over.

818
00:38:21,230 --> 00:38:22,150
Your customer

819
00:38:22,150 --> 00:38:23,560
won't come to pick it up right now.

820
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:24,470
How about

821
00:38:24,470 --> 00:38:25,470
you sell the petroleum

822
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:27,080
to these two customers first?

823
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:27,840
I believe

824
00:38:27,950 --> 00:38:29,230
you can get more soon.

825
00:38:30,630 --> 00:38:31,910
But, I...

826
00:38:31,950 --> 00:38:33,360
Do me a favor.

827
00:38:33,390 --> 00:38:34,150
If you need any help

828
00:38:34,150 --> 00:38:35,430
in the future,

829
00:38:35,630 --> 00:38:36,520
just let me know.

830
00:38:38,910 --> 00:38:39,430
Alright.

831
00:38:39,670 --> 00:38:40,360
Since

832
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:42,000
you've put it this way,

833
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,190
I'll sell it to you two.

834
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:46,150
Thank you.

835
00:38:46,470 --> 00:38:47,800
Here is the money.

836
00:38:48,950 --> 00:38:49,560
Okay.

837
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,560
This stuff burns pretty fiercely.

838
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:03,280
Please step back a bit more.

839
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:20,560
Father.

840
00:39:21,390 --> 00:39:22,190
Mother.

841
00:39:27,630 --> 00:39:28,710
Is that the smell?

842
00:39:30,190 --> 00:39:31,000
That's it.

843
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:34,150
Mr. Zhang,

844
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:35,360
how much petroleum

845
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:36,320
do we need

846
00:39:36,390 --> 00:39:37,470
to burn down a regular house?

847
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:41,870
With such a big bucket,

848
00:39:41,870 --> 00:39:43,390
you'd need two big buckets.

849
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:45,670
But no one would

850
00:39:45,670 --> 00:39:47,390
want to use it to burn a house.

851
00:39:48,230 --> 00:39:49,800
Why? Is it too expensive?

852
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:51,520
To be honest,

853
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:53,320
the petroleum

854
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:54,560
is a military supply.

855
00:39:55,150 --> 00:39:57,150
It's hard for ordinary people to get it,

856
00:39:57,190 --> 00:39:58,040
let alone

857
00:39:58,040 --> 00:39:59,000
get that much.

858
00:40:14,950 --> 00:40:16,520
Why are you so nervous?

859
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:18,870
My house was burned down
thirteen years ago.

860
00:40:18,870 --> 00:40:20,080
Your father is the current Governor.

861
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:21,950
He should have nothing to do with it.

862
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:23,280
Thirteen years ago,

863
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:26,120
my father was in Shanxi,

864
00:40:26,670 --> 00:40:28,000
serving as the Assistant
Regional Military Commissioner.

865
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:30,630
Don't worry.

866
00:40:30,630 --> 00:40:31,230
I will find out

867
00:40:31,230 --> 00:40:32,320
the truth behind this.

868
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:33,360
For you,

869
00:40:33,470 --> 00:40:34,760
and for my family's honor.

870
00:40:36,870 --> 00:40:38,080
I'm going to Wei Suo.

871
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:40,560
It's getting late.

872
00:40:41,190 --> 00:40:42,150
Go tomorrow.

873
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:45,040
Eat more.

874
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,040
What's wrong, Yulan?

875
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:10,360
I'm full.

876
00:41:18,470 --> 00:41:20,040
How about having another drumstick?

877
00:41:24,430 --> 00:41:25,190
Master.

878
00:41:25,190 --> 00:41:25,950
Eat.

879
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:31,910
It's almost done.

880
00:41:36,670 --> 00:41:37,470
By the way,

881
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:39,320
didn't Mrs. Guo say that

882
00:41:39,950 --> 00:41:40,710
you were entrusted to

883
00:41:40,710 --> 00:41:42,600
her husband's cousin?

884
00:41:42,870 --> 00:41:43,670
Why

885
00:41:44,390 --> 00:41:45,870
did you end up at the Qin family?

886
00:41:46,230 --> 00:41:49,710
Mr. Guo's cousin was an alcoholic

887
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:53,040
who was drunk every day.

888
00:41:53,870 --> 00:41:55,280
After I went to his place,

889
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:56,870
it wasn't long before

890
00:41:57,630 --> 00:41:59,430
he sold me to a middleman

891
00:42:00,390 --> 00:42:01,630
for a few drinks.

892
00:42:04,470 --> 00:42:05,320
After that,

893
00:42:06,430 --> 00:42:07,910
I was sold to the Qin family.

894
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:12,000
The day I went to the Qin family,

895
00:42:12,870 --> 00:42:14,150
the person who took me in

896
00:42:15,870 --> 00:42:16,800
was Qin Yi.

897
00:42:57,120 --> 00:42:57,840
