[Adapted from the novel
"Jin Nang" by Shui He]

00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:33,020
[Episode 26]

4
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:37,000
Mr. Qin, we're here.

5
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:00,310
Who are you looking for?

6
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:24,110
Xu Biao.

7
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,830
I finally found you.

8
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:32,270
Who are you?

9
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:33,800
Luo Qingfeng's daughter

10
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:36,080
is currently investigating

11
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,320
her parents' cause of death.

12
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:41,190
You're from the Qi family.

13
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,030
I'm not from the Qi family.

14
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,830
I just know some truths.

15
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:51,670
I came to ask you for a favor.

16
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:54,670
I can never do anything

17
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:57,630
that betrays my conscience again.

18
00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:01,800
I deeply regret

19
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:04,600
what I did years ago.

20
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,390
It's just a small favor.

21
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,630
It won't go against your conscience.

22
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:11,670
I...

23
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:24,390
You just need to tell

24
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:25,830
Luo Qingfeng's daughter the truth.

25
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:29,600
Say that the Qi family had you

26
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:32,470
tempt Luo Qingfeng to gamble.

27
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,880
What do you want?

28
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:37,910
You want her to believe

29
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,000
the Qi family

30
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,190
killed her parents?

31
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,880
Isn't that the truth?

32
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:48,440
Why do you want to do this?

33
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:52,520
The Qi family is also my enemy.

34
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,470
They didn't just kill Luo Qingfeng.

35
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:57,240
They also destroyed my wife's family.

36
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,110
I...

37
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:01,270
Telling Luo Qingfeng's daughter
the truth

38
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:02,470
could be a way to atone.

39
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,080
Think of it as making amends.

40
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:07,910
How about this:

41
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,160
I can buy a house

42
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,470
for your family

43
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:13,000
and provide them with money monthly,

44
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,800
to ensure they have enough to live.

45
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:17,720
I'm a businessman.

46
00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:19,950
I value credit,

47
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,760
treating everyone honestly.

48
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:18,320
What's got you in such a hurry?

49
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:19,230
Mr. Yanjin,

50
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,510
Qin Yi found Xu Biao.

51
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,550
I found the one who took your father

52
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:26,640
to Changsheng Gambling House back then.

53
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:27,670
His name is Xu Biao.

54
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,160
He, like your father,

55
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,640
was a minor official
in charge of the granary.

56
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:32,160
Where is he now?

57
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,070
After the fire,

58
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:34,270
he went into hiding

59
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:35,790
and made a living doing manual labor.

60
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:37,160
Luo Shu.

61
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,510
Mr. Menglin.

62
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:43,720
What are you doing here?

63
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:45,320
Luo Shu.

64
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,350
Yanjin has found

65
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:47,920
the one who took your father
to Changsheng Gambling House.

66
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:49,600
He's already gone over there.

67
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,670
Let's hurry over.

68
00:05:58,350 --> 00:05:59,160
Yanjin.

69
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:01,670
What's the situation?

70
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:02,480
Where is he?

71
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:08,830
How did you

72
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,550
find this person?

73
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:14,070
I found out

74
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,040
that someone named Xu used
to manage petroleum

75
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:17,830
in the military,

76
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:19,640
so I asked him some questions.

77
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:22,320
He mentioned that before the fire,

78
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:24,920
he had helped

79
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:26,760
his cousin Xu Biao

80
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,270
by giving him some petroleum.

81
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:41,550
Are you alright?

82
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:51,040
Yanjin, you're really amazing.

83
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:52,320
You found Xu Biao

84
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,510
in such a short time.

85
00:06:57,270 --> 00:06:59,230
Justice will be

86
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,550
served eventually.

87
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,720
You are Xu Biao?

88
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:19,830
Yes.

89
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,790
I'm Luo Qingfeng's daughter.

90
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:23,920
I want to know

91
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:26,600
what really happened back then.

92
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:30,670
I...

93
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:32,550
I'm a sinner.

94
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:36,350
I killed Luo.

95
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,480
I have deep sins.

96
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,160
I'm worse than a beast.

97
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:43,880
Back then,

98
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:46,920
I had a good relationship with Luo.

99
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:49,510
I often heard him talk
about his family's financial struggles.

100
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,200
His wife was sick

101
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,510
but he couldn't afford a doctor.

102
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:54,880
It's all my fault.

103
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:57,510
I was too fond of gambling back then,

104
00:07:57,510 --> 00:07:59,350
so I pushed him to the gambling house

105
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:00,510
to try his luck.

106
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:01,550
But who knew

107
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,830
he had such good luck?

108
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,270
He kept winning.

109
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:07,880
He won a lot of money.

110
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:10,350
But I kept losing.

111
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:12,640
So I had a bad thought.

112
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:15,200
I sneaked into your house at night
to steal money,

113
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:17,320
but I didn't expect to alert Luo,

114
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,670
so we got into a fight.

115
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:19,790
At that Motherent, I...

116
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:22,230
I lost control

117
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:25,040
and killed both of them.

118
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,520
You killed them?

119
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,080
After that,

120
00:08:38,470 --> 00:08:41,150
I panicked.

121
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,080
I was afraid the authorities
would find out.

122
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,440
So I made it look like a fire

123
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:45,470
to destroy the evidence.

124
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:46,590
But that day,

125
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:48,150
it rained.

126
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:49,670
I couldn't start the fire.

127
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,710
Then I remembered

128
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:54,030
that at home I had some petroleum,

129
00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:55,200
which is waterproof.

130
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,400
I quickly fetched it,

131
00:08:56,710 --> 00:08:57,520
and finally,

132
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,710
I managed to ignite it.

133
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:02,790
Didn't you say

134
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:04,150
you had a good relationship
with my father?

135
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,840
How could you do this?

136
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:06,880
Was it just

137
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:07,960
for the money

138
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:10,110
that you killed
your friend's entire family?

139
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:11,960
Speak!

140
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:12,670
I...

141
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:16,760
I...

142
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:18,520
Are you sure what you just said

143
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:19,470
is the truth,

144
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,710
or is there more to it?

145
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,840
If there's more to it,

146
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,670
you need to tell us everything.

147
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:38,590
I'm a sinner.

148
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:41,000
I wronged Luo.

149
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,230
I'm a beast.

150
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:48,520
A life for a life.

151
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:50,880
I'll pay for Luo's life.

152
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,320
It has nothing to do with my family.

153
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:06,350
Yanjin, quick! Save him!

154
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,000
He's already dead.

155
00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:35,400
Father.

156
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:37,790
Mother.

157
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:41,960
Father.

158
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:43,350
Mother.

159
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:44,960
Father.

160
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:46,550
Mother.

161
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:48,590
Luo Shu.

162
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:26,840
You're awake.

163
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:28,790
Sit down quickly.

164
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:30,030
Sit down!

165
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,790
Here's some Anshen Tang;
drink it warm.

166
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:44,030
You haven't slept all night?

167
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,350
I woke up early.

168
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:49,840
After bringing it to you yesterday,

169
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:51,110
I slept in the next room

170
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,110
until morning.

171
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:55,840
Why not stay

172
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,400
in the comfort of the Qi Mansion

173
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,760
and come to the inn instead?

174
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,320
At a time like this,

175
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,760
don't even think about making me leave.

176
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:05,080
If I leave,

177
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,230
who will make you medicine?

178
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:07,710
Come on.

179
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:19,960
Does your head still hurt?

180
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:24,520
My mind is just a bit jumbled.

181
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:25,840
I keep feeling like

182
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,590
I can't escape

183
00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:29,520
from that fire.

184
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:33,230
Don't mention it.

185
00:12:33,710 --> 00:12:35,150
I'm still a bit dazed myself.

186
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:36,640
It's strange.

187
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:39,590
The murderer was suddenly found.

188
00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:41,640
And then

189
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:44,790
he suddenly died.

190
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,200
Yeah.

191
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:52,910
Something's off.

192
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:55,640
What's off?

193
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:58,110
When I was at Xu Biao's place,

194
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:00,400
I felt something was weird,

195
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:02,790
but because I was so distracted
at the time,

196
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:04,400
I didn't have time to think about it.

197
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:06,550
Looking back now,

198
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:09,550
it seems more suspicious.

199
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:11,440
What do you think?

200
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,030
Don't you think

201
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:14,840
the murderer appeared too suddenly?

202
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:15,960
Yeah.

203
00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:17,550
Your brother and Qin Yi said

204
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:18,710
they would help us find him.

205
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,440
And now, he's been found.

206
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:21,590
It was them

207
00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:22,590
who found him together.

208
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:24,670
That's a bit too coincidental, isn't it?

209
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:26,840
It is coincidental.

210
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:29,280
But both of them

211
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:30,960
know a lot of people and have influence.

212
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,000
They also have many underlings.

213
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:34,280
So it's possible.

214
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:35,670
But I still feel like

215
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:37,320
everything is going too smoothly.

216
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:38,710
It feels like

217
00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:40,640
someone is deliberately
arranging things.

218
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:42,440
Besides,

219
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:45,400
this isn't the only coincidence.

220
00:13:46,590 --> 00:13:47,350
What else?

221
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:50,030
Xu Biao said

222
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:52,280
he took my father to gamble.

223
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:55,760
Coincidentally, my father had good luck

224
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,030
and won a lot of money,

225
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:58,960
which sparked his greed.

226
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,550
He stole money and killed my parents.

227
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:05,790
When he tried to set fire,

228
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:08,440
coincidentally,
he had petroleum at home.

229
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:12,470
Is this really just a coincidence?

230
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:16,000
He confessed to me,

231
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,400
but before I could say anything,

232
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:20,280
he suddenly headbutted the wooden pillar
and died.

233
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:23,550
Why was he in such a hurry?

234
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:25,710
Was he eager to die

235
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,150
just out of guilt?

236
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:30,350
I remember his expression.

237
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:32,790
It looked like

238
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:35,110
he was scared.

239
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:36,440
A life for a life.

240
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:38,840
I'll pay for Luo's life.

241
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:40,400
It has nothing to do with my family.

242
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,960
It has nothing to do with my family.

243
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:47,030
Yes, he was afraid.

244
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,350
But what exactly was he afraid of?

245
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:52,790
What about his family?

246
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,110
Before he died,

247
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,960
he kept mentioning his family.

248
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:57,960
But inside the house,

249
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,520
he was clearly alone.

250
00:15:00,590 --> 00:15:01,470
Could it be that

251
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:03,350
the real murderer had already

252
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:04,280
kidnapped his family,

253
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:06,200
forcing him to take the blame?

254
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:49,590
Madam,

255
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:50,440
do you know

256
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:52,000
where the family next door went?

257
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:54,640
They seem to have moved away.

258
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:55,760
Moved away?

259
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,030
When did that happen?

260
00:15:57,030 --> 00:15:58,230
Last night.

261
00:15:58,840 --> 00:15:59,840
Xu Biao

262
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:01,400
died during the day.

263
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:03,440
In the middle of the night,
a carriage came

264
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:05,230
and took his wife

265
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:06,400
and kids home.

266
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:08,790
Then there was a commotion inside,

267
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:10,030
with all sorts of noises.

268
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:11,760
Not long after that,

269
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:14,030
they all left in the carriage.

270
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:15,760
Thanks.

271
00:16:18,590 --> 00:16:19,880
But that day, it rained.

272
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,400
I couldn't start the fire.

273
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:22,440
I...

274
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,910
Then I remembered

275
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:25,960
that at home I had some petroleum,

276
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:27,110
which is waterproof.

277
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:28,320
I quickly fetched it,

278
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,230
and finally,

279
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:32,080
I managed to ignite it.

280
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:36,280
The rain started after the fire was lit.

281
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:37,880
We saw your house was on fire.

282
00:16:38,590 --> 00:16:40,320
All the neighbors came out

283
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,470
trying to put out the fire.

284
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:43,470
The rain started to fall,

285
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:45,030
getting heavier and heavier.

286
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:46,520
Unexpectedly,

287
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,960
it grew even fiercer.

288
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:53,200
I've never seen a fire

289
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:55,350
that rain couldn't put out in my life.

290
00:16:58,960 --> 00:16:59,960
Someone's lying.

291
00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:00,960
Who's lying?

292
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:02,640
Either Xu Biao or Mrs. Guo

293
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:04,000
must be lying.

294
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:10,830
Miss, it's you!

295
00:17:11,710 --> 00:17:12,520
Excuse me,

296
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:13,520
have you seen

297
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:14,830
Mr. Guo and Mrs. Guo?

298
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:15,880
They're gone.

299
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:16,800
Gone?

300
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:18,280
But we just saw them

301
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:19,310
a few days ago.

302
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:20,070
How could they...?

303
00:17:20,070 --> 00:17:22,000
I heard that while they were
burning charcoal for warmth,

304
00:17:22,190 --> 00:17:24,560
their room was sealed too tightly.

305
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,040
The old couple fell asleep,

306
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,280
and never woke up.

307
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:28,950
What about their bodies?

308
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:30,350
They've already been buried.

309
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:32,470
Their son has gone away

310
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:33,680
and won't be back.

311
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:44,160
[Always In Our Hearts]

312
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:57,070
You really have a good strategy.

313
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:58,590
Not really.

314
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:01,640
It's you who're better.

315
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:03,760
You were a step ahead of me

316
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:04,880
and won a round.

317
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:09,560
I was just

318
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:11,070
reacting to your move.

319
00:18:12,310 --> 00:18:13,560
Your casual move

320
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:15,160
was so sharp and ruthless.

321
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:17,470
I really can't compare.

322
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
You know,

323
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:21,590
I come from a tough background.

324
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:23,400
I've been through a lot

325
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,680
as a kid.

326
00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:26,560
It's shaped my personality.

327
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,470
If I feel pressured,

328
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:32,430
my blood

329
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:33,950
will rush

330
00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:35,830
to my head,

331
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:39,160
and then I can't control myself.

332
00:18:58,760 --> 00:18:59,680
Check!

333
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:07,680
My father said

334
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:12,230
he'll give your Qin family
a year's worth of salt permits.

335
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:18,350
You know I'm not after that.

336
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,350
Qin Yi,

337
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,880
take care of yourself.

338
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,680
How about

339
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,000
we call it a draw?

340
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:56,110
Okay.

341
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:01,830
Luo Shu,

342
00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:03,710
after you leave Linfen,

343
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:05,680
go as far as you can,

344
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:07,040
don't go back to Taiyuan.

345
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,350
Don't trust anyone,

346
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:09,520
except yourself.

347
00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:12,520
You don't want to go to Taiyuan?

348
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,800
Where are you planning to go?

349
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:17,430
Where else can I go?

350
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:20,520
I was just teasing her.

351
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:22,230
Mingke House is my home.

352
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,310
I'm fine here.

353
00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:26,590
I'm not going anywhere.

354
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:29,070
Miaocui,

355
00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:31,350
do you know anything?

356
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:43,920
Are you okay?

357
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:00,710
Don't be discouraged.

358
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:04,160
It may seem like we've hit a dead end,

359
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:05,800
but we can find new leads.

360
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:09,470
Luo Shu, just keep investigating.

361
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:10,680
Don't worry about anyone,

362
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:11,400
including me.

363
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:14,310
Even if this matter

364
00:21:14,310 --> 00:21:16,000
really implicates Yanjin in the end,

365
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:17,710
I won't hesitate at all.

366
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:19,280
Let's leave it here.

367
00:21:20,190 --> 00:21:21,640
The murderer has confessed.

368
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:23,070
Why?

369
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:24,880
There are so many doubts now.

370
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:25,400
What they said

371
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,640
might not be true.

372
00:21:27,830 --> 00:21:29,110
I want to go back to Linfen.

373
00:21:30,110 --> 00:21:31,070
Back to Linfen?

374
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:37,590
When I was twelve,

375
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,950
Wuniang took me to Mingke House.

376
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:42,310
Two years later, she died,

377
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,400
leaving me a lot of money.

378
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:45,920
That money

379
00:21:45,950 --> 00:21:47,520
was enough for me to buy my freedom.

380
00:21:48,310 --> 00:21:49,590
But all these years,

381
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:51,230
I've tried everything,

382
00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:52,800
but I still couldn't succeed.

383
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:55,470
Every time I got close

384
00:21:55,470 --> 00:21:56,830
to the goal,

385
00:21:57,350 --> 00:21:58,520
it fell apart.

386
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,560
I feel like there's an invisible hand

387
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:03,350
manipulating my life

388
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:04,880
from behind the scenes.

389
00:22:06,470 --> 00:22:07,950
After leaving Mingke House,

390
00:22:08,430 --> 00:22:10,040
that feeling disappeared.

391
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:14,000
But recently, it's come back.

392
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:15,830
So,

393
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:19,430
you've failed again.

394
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:22,230
Going back to Linfen

395
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:24,470
might help me find new clues.

396
00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:28,000
I'll go back with you.

397
00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:32,760
Can you promise me two things?

398
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:35,230
Sure, I can promise you a hundred.

399
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:36,880
I haven't even said them yet.

400
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:37,920
Go ahead, say it.

401
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:39,590
First,

402
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:41,880
don't

403
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,470
spend money so lavishly anymore.

404
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,190
Look at all these snacks here.

405
00:22:45,190 --> 00:22:46,520
They're piling up.

406
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:48,470
As a common person

407
00:22:48,710 --> 00:22:50,040
who struggles to make a living,

408
00:22:50,430 --> 00:22:52,160
I can't stand this waste.

409
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:53,470
Okay.

410
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:55,760
From now on, I'll only buy

411
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:56,470
what you tell me to.

412
00:22:56,830 --> 00:22:57,520
Second,

413
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:59,350
you should return the room

414
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:00,920
and spend more time with your family.

415
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:03,040
Your grandmother is getting older

416
00:23:03,230 --> 00:23:04,110
and she dotes on you.

417
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,800
You should be filial to her by her side.

418
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:08,560
Don't be like me.

419
00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:11,230
My family is gone.

420
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:13,800
Even if I want to be filial,
I have no one to care for.

421
00:23:19,070 --> 00:23:20,350
I promise you everything you said.

422
00:23:21,110 --> 00:23:22,310
I'll try my best to do it.

423
00:23:24,430 --> 00:23:25,230
But right now,

424
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,310
there's no one around you but me.

425
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:29,640
No matter what you say,

426
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:30,760
I won't leave you.

427
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,520
If you miss your family,

428
00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:38,430
think of me as your family.

429
00:23:40,430 --> 00:23:41,520
If you feel homesick,

430
00:23:45,310 --> 00:23:46,590
I can give you a home too.

431
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,310
Tonight is the Lantern Festival.

432
00:23:55,590 --> 00:23:57,400
Taiyuan must be lively.

433
00:23:59,000 --> 00:23:59,800
Yeah.

434
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:01,680
The whole city is decorated
with lanterns.

435
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:02,830
There's plenty to eat and drink.

436
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:04,310
So let's go for a stroll.

437
00:24:04,830 --> 00:24:05,560
Okay!

438
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,430
You should relax a bit.

439
00:24:10,430 --> 00:24:11,560
Lian Shu, take a look.

440
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:12,640
How do I look in this?

441
00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:13,760
Great.

442
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:14,950
You look great, Young Master.

443
00:24:14,950 --> 00:24:16,070
Is it for real?

444
00:24:16,070 --> 00:24:16,800
It's for real.

445
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:17,350
Really?

446
00:24:17,350 --> 00:24:18,000
Young Master, I don't know

447
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:18,560
about other things,

448
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:20,350
but your looks are definitely great.

449
00:24:20,350 --> 00:24:21,110
You really think so?

450
00:24:21,230 --> 00:24:22,310
That's fine.

451
00:24:30,190 --> 00:24:32,680
Why are you dressed like this?

452
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:33,950
Is there a problem?

453
00:24:34,590 --> 00:24:36,070
No, but

454
00:24:36,310 --> 00:24:37,000
how can we walk

455
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,110
around the lantern festival together
as two men?

456
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:38,950
You're dressed like this.

457
00:24:38,950 --> 00:24:40,350
Am I supposed to wear women's clothes?

458
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:42,230
That's fine, Young Master.

459
00:24:42,710 --> 00:24:43,640
What are you saying?

460
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:45,520
You're not good at anything.

461
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:47,520
It's not like it's impossible.

462
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,160
Great.

463
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,110
Great.

464
00:25:26,470 --> 00:25:27,680
Flower buns!

465
00:25:27,950 --> 00:25:28,760
Come and see!

466
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:30,350
Delicious flower buns!

467
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:39,640
The east wind at night adorns
a thousand trees with blossoms,

468
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:43,040
and blows down stars like rain.

469
00:25:43,430 --> 00:25:45,830
The scent of fine steeds
and carved carriages fills the streets.

470
00:25:46,310 --> 00:25:50,070
The sound of the flute resonates,
the light from the jade pot flickers,

471
00:25:50,070 --> 00:25:52,800
and fish and dragon lanterns
dance all night long.

472
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:54,880
That's nice.

473
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:57,400
You're really impressive now.

474
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:01,230
Freshly fried rice cakes.

475
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:03,070
They are delicious!

476
00:26:03,070 --> 00:26:03,830
Two, please.

477
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,800
Boss, two of those.

478
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,350
Okay, thanks.

479
00:26:23,350 --> 00:26:24,160
Which one?

480
00:26:25,710 --> 00:26:26,520
This one.

481
00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:27,950
Let's go.

482
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,110
Excuse me.

483
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:30,110
Let's go see the acrobatics.

484
00:26:30,110 --> 00:26:31,280
Hurry up!

485
00:26:32,310 --> 00:26:33,230
- Quick.
- Okay.

486
00:26:54,950 --> 00:26:56,350
Great.

487
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:57,070

Elegant ladies adorned
with gold and silver ornaments.

492

Their laughter and soft fragrance
linger as they pass by.

493
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:20,920
I've searched for her a thousand times
among the crowd.

494
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,520
Suddenly, I turn around.

495
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:29,400

I'll be devoted to you

Great.

516
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:52,710
Lian Shu.

517
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:56,160
Get the carriage ready.
I want to go back to Linfen.

518
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:57,950
What's wrong?

519
00:28:57,950 --> 00:28:58,950
Don't ask. Just go.

520
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:00,070
Yes, Young Master.

521
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:09,760
Luo Shu,

522
00:29:12,190 --> 00:29:13,920
do you want to avoid me that much?

523
00:29:25,350 --> 00:29:26,470
Welcome back, Mr. Menglin.

524
00:29:27,430 --> 00:29:28,560
I'll go report it right away.

525
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:29,350
No need.

526
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:36,400
Greetings, Mr. Menglin.

527
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:39,560
How should we handle the matter

528
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:40,830
with Minister Hu?

529
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:42,920
Let me think about it.

530
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:45,160
I think if there's still a chance...

531
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:50,680
Come in.

532
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:02,230
Father.

533
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,400
You finally decided to come back.

534
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:07,280
What day is it today?

535
00:30:08,190 --> 00:30:09,400
Do you still remember

536
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:11,040
what I said at the family banquet?

537
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,280
Your grandmother is getting on in years.

538
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:15,430
We don't know how many more reunions

539
00:30:15,430 --> 00:30:16,680
she has left.

540
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:18,590
Tonight, because of you,

541
00:30:18,590 --> 00:30:20,070
she ended up in tears.

542
00:30:20,070 --> 00:30:21,000
I know I was wrong, Father.

543
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:22,520
I'll go apologize

544
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:25,680
to Grandmother.

545
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:26,520
No need to go.

546
00:30:27,830 --> 00:30:28,830
It's too late.

547
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:30,230
Don't disturb

548
00:30:30,230 --> 00:30:31,830
her now.

549
00:30:35,470 --> 00:30:36,950
Today, Menglin is being sensible.

550
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:38,680
He knows to apologize to you.

551
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,280
That's good.

552
00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:52,880
What's wrong?
Do you have something to say?

553
00:30:54,190 --> 00:30:56,920
Father, I plan

554
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:59,230
to leave for Linfen
first thing tomorrow morning.

555
00:30:59,710 --> 00:31:00,950
I specifically came
to ask for your permission.

556
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:04,760
The festival isn't over yet.

557
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:07,520
Why are you in such a hurry to leave?

558
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:08,560
I have urgent matters, Father.

559
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:10,110
What urgent matters
could you have?

560
00:31:12,710 --> 00:31:13,680
You've been home for days.

561
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:15,520
How many serious things
have you done?

562
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:16,310
Have you visited any confidants

563
00:31:16,310 --> 00:31:18,000
on my behalf?

564
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:19,800
And what about the household affairs

565
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:21,560
for your two elder brothers?

566
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:26,920
But still, in your  eyes,

567
00:31:27,110 --> 00:31:27,920
I'm just

568
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:28,760
a good-for-nothing.

569
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:29,640
So if that's the case,

570
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:30,680
I might as well go back to Linfen early

571
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:31,560
to avoid causing trouble for you.

572
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:32,830
You scoundrel!

573
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:34,070
Menglin,

574
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:36,110
stop messing around.

575
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:37,950
Quickly apologize to Father.

576
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:42,950
Is it that in your eyes,

577
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:45,070
if I don't visit those people,

578
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:46,710
I'm a scoundrel?

579
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:47,760
If I don't build connections,

580
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:48,590
I'm a scoundrel?

581
00:31:48,590 --> 00:31:49,520
If I don't be sociable,

582
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:50,280
I'm a scoundrel?

583
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:51,040
In Linfen,

584
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,190
I'm solving cases with my friends,

585
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:53,950
helping innocent people
clear their names,

586
00:31:53,950 --> 00:31:55,350
and bringing evildoers to justice.

587
00:31:55,350 --> 00:31:56,070
Is that scoundrel behavior too?

588
00:31:56,310 --> 00:31:57,800
You unfilial son...

589
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:59,640
Then go ahead. I'll accept it.

590
00:32:01,310 --> 00:32:02,880
Father, please calm down.

591
00:32:06,710 --> 00:32:09,230
Father, even though Menglin is stubborn,

592
00:32:09,710 --> 00:32:10,950
he has indeed matured a lot

593
00:32:10,950 --> 00:32:12,590
this year in Linfen.

594
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:14,800
But after all, he's still young.

595
00:32:15,190 --> 00:32:16,520
He's just throwing a little tantrum.

596
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:18,040
He spoke without thinking.

597
00:32:18,190 --> 00:32:19,470
Please don't be angry, Father.

598
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:28,070
Lin,

599
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:30,350
I know you've done a lot of good work

600
00:32:30,350 --> 00:32:32,160
in Linfen.

601
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:33,920
You've improved a lot

602
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:35,590
compared to before.

603
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:38,470
I'm really proud of you.

604
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:41,350
But now you've grown up.

605
00:32:41,590 --> 00:32:43,470
You're not just yourself anymore.

606
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:46,560
You're also the legitimate son
of our Qi family.

607
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:48,830
You need
to take on your responsibilities

608
00:32:48,830 --> 00:32:51,000
to our Qi family.

609
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:58,310
The current situation is unstable.

610
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:01,000
Our Qi family is
in a precarious position.

611
00:33:01,590 --> 00:33:03,280
Father is trying his best to mediate.

612
00:33:05,310 --> 00:33:09,400
A storm is brewing.

613
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:11,190
Father,

614
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:14,950
I never wanted you to know

615
00:33:14,950 --> 00:33:17,000
about these matters.

616
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:19,070
Because I,
along with your two elder brothers,

617
00:33:19,070 --> 00:33:21,190
have been holding up everything up.

618
00:33:21,350 --> 00:33:22,430
But this time

619
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:24,830
is truly unusual.

620
00:33:25,310 --> 00:33:28,230
You can no longer stand aside.

621
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:32,800
When the nest is overturned,
no egg can remain unbroken.

622
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:36,950
Father, what do you need me to do?

623
00:33:37,430 --> 00:33:38,880
From today on,

624
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:41,110
don't step out

625
00:33:41,110 --> 00:33:42,160
of this door easily.

626
00:33:42,190 --> 00:33:43,000
Father.

627
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:45,680
You are innocent and inexperienced,

628
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:46,590
so you might easily

629
00:33:46,590 --> 00:33:47,640
be used by others

630
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:48,040
as a target

631
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:49,950
against our Qi family.

632
00:33:50,310 --> 00:33:52,470
So from now on,

633
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:54,000
stay home,

634
00:33:54,190 --> 00:33:57,070
which is the biggest help
to our Qi family.

635
00:33:58,280 --> 00:33:59,160
Ultimately,

636
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:00,880
in your eyes,

637
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:01,560
I'm just

638
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:02,800
a burden and calamity for our Qi family.

639
00:34:03,070 --> 00:34:04,280
You unfilial son...

640
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:06,040
Father!

641
00:34:06,190 --> 00:34:07,000
Menglin!

642
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:08,600
Fengzhou.

643
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:12,320
Menglin,

644
00:34:13,150 --> 00:34:14,800
I've always had poor health.

645
00:34:15,390 --> 00:34:16,670
You need to help me

646
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:18,870
ease Father's burden

647
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:20,870
and contribute to our Qi family.

648
00:34:20,910 --> 00:34:21,710
Fengzhou...

649
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:26,280
Help Fengzhou back inside.

650
00:34:27,430 --> 00:34:28,840
He needs to take his medicine.

651
00:34:50,150 --> 00:34:50,950
Luo Shu.

652
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:55,230
I like you.

653
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:15,150
It's a pity

654
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:17,520
that the beauty and splendor
of this world

655
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:20,120
are just fleeting dreams.

656
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,230
They will eventually fade away.

657
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:56,760
[Linfen]

658
00:35:57,630 --> 00:35:58,520
Thank you.

659
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:12,960
[Qiao Family Inn]

660
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:21,950
Madam, are you looking for a room?

661
00:36:21,950 --> 00:36:22,600
Yes.

662
00:36:22,710 --> 00:36:23,800
How many rooms do you need?

663
00:36:23,910 --> 00:36:24,950
One room.

664
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:25,840
Got it.

665
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:29,630
Luo Shu!

666
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:32,840
It's really you.

667
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:35,150
Ruolan, what are you doing here?

668
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:36,630
To make it easier for me

669
00:36:36,630 --> 00:36:38,150
to run the liquor workshop,

670
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:40,390
my husband moved here with me.

671
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:41,520
At first,

672
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:42,910
this place was just for the convenience

673
00:36:42,910 --> 00:36:44,520
of merchants buying liquor.

674
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:46,390
I didn't expect it to keep going.

675
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:49,390
You're really quite clever.

676
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:51,320
Not really.

677
00:36:51,470 --> 00:36:53,080
I just have good luck.

678
00:36:53,230 --> 00:36:54,470
I always meet helpful people.

679
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:58,800
Aren't you going back to the yamen?

680
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:01,230
I've taken off my official robes.

681
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:02,520
This time, I'm back in Linfen

682
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:03,840
to handle some matters.

683
00:37:04,390 --> 00:37:05,280
So I need to stay outside.

684
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:06,470
Then stay with me.

685
00:37:06,630 --> 00:37:08,080
I promise

686
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:09,320
to make you comfortable.

687
00:37:09,390 --> 00:37:11,080
We can chat when we have time.

688
00:37:11,390 --> 00:37:11,950
Sounds good!

689
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:13,150
Let's go!

690
00:37:21,190 --> 00:37:22,430
Please come in.

691
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:25,870
You

692
00:37:25,870 --> 00:37:27,080
look quite familiar.

693
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:28,710
You must have been here before.

694
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:31,430
Which woman do you want to see today?

695
00:37:31,430 --> 00:37:32,280
Jin Miaocui.

696
00:37:32,950 --> 00:37:34,230
I thought you meant some top woman.

697
00:37:34,230 --> 00:37:34,840
How about...

698
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:36,190
Peony, Jin Lian.

699
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:38,600
Jin Nang, why are you back again?

700
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:40,080
Why can't you remember?

701
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:41,710
She's called Luo Shu now.

702
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:43,950
How have you been lately?

703
00:37:44,710 --> 00:37:46,360
Same old. Pretty good.

704
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:48,670
Is Miaocui inside?

705
00:37:49,470 --> 00:37:50,080
Luo Shu,

706
00:37:51,190 --> 00:37:53,600
you should go ask Madam Yu.

707
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:55,600
No need.

708
00:38:00,230 --> 00:38:03,560
Chief Luo, why are you back again?

709
00:38:04,150 --> 00:38:06,080
If you like Mingke House so much,

710
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:07,430
why did you insist

711
00:38:07,430 --> 00:38:08,360
on leaving then?

712
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:09,360
Madam Yu,

713
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:11,000
let's not

714
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,320
bring up the past.

715
00:38:12,910 --> 00:38:14,560
I just want to see Miaocui.

716
00:38:14,630 --> 00:38:16,040
You know

717
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:17,390
the rules here.

718
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:19,670
You can't just see

719
00:38:19,670 --> 00:38:21,000
anyone you want.

720
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:22,710
You have to get through me first.

721
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:26,800
As usual,

722
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:28,360
I'll buy Miaocui two hours.

723
00:38:34,230 --> 00:38:35,390
Looks like you are deliberately

724
00:38:35,390 --> 00:38:37,080
keeping me from seeing Miaocui.

725
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:39,430
I'm not someone

726
00:38:39,710 --> 00:38:41,560
who only cares about money all the time.

727
00:38:43,430 --> 00:38:44,630
So I'll use these 20 liang

728
00:38:44,870 --> 00:38:46,190
to buy two hours of you.

729
00:38:47,230 --> 00:38:48,040
How about it?

730
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:51,190
Redeem her?

731
00:38:51,950 --> 00:38:52,910
Honestly, Madam,

732
00:38:53,390 --> 00:38:54,280
when Miaocui and I

733
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:55,760
left Mingke House,

734
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:57,800
we made a promise to always

735
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:59,230
be together, never to part.

736
00:38:59,910 --> 00:39:01,800
Now that I'm free,

737
00:39:01,870 --> 00:39:03,000
Miaocui is left alone

738
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,150
at Mingke House.

739
00:39:04,390 --> 00:39:05,870
I really feel uneasy.

740
00:39:06,630 --> 00:39:07,560
So today,

741
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,840
I'm here to keep my promise.

742
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:19,670
I was wrong before.

743
00:39:20,150 --> 00:39:21,710
I shouldn't have taken Miaocui
and run away.

744
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:23,840
Now I've gathered enough money.

745
00:39:24,190 --> 00:39:25,870
I'll follow your rules

746
00:39:26,150 --> 00:39:27,600
as long as I can redeem her.

747
00:39:29,670 --> 00:39:30,870
Look at you,

748
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:32,560
making it sound like

749
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:33,910
she's the one who got hurt here.

750
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:35,910
I know you wouldn't

751
00:39:35,910 --> 00:39:37,150
mistreat anyone.

752
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:38,630
It's just that

753
00:39:38,870 --> 00:39:39,760
Miaocui

754
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:41,230
is getting older,

755
00:39:41,390 --> 00:39:42,470
and her business

756
00:39:42,470 --> 00:39:44,150
will naturally be worse than before.

757
00:39:44,630 --> 00:39:46,120
If you let her go,

758
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:46,910
it'll also

759
00:39:46,910 --> 00:39:48,320
free you from worry,

760
00:39:48,670 --> 00:39:50,040
and bring me peace of mind.

761
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:51,430
It's a win-win.

762
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:53,870
Please help me.

763
00:39:55,950 --> 00:39:58,150
Hearing this from you,

764
00:39:58,360 --> 00:39:59,320
it sounds like

765
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:01,040
I'm the one getting the better deal.

766
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:05,520
Jin Miaocui came back

767
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:06,870
with me voluntarily.

768
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:08,600
Isn't that right?

769
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:10,600
You encouraged her.

770
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:12,080
But she didn't listen to you.

771
00:40:13,870 --> 00:40:15,150
Later, you tried to persuade her

772
00:40:15,150 --> 00:40:16,040
to go with you.

773
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:18,080
She didn't listen either.

774
00:40:18,950 --> 00:40:22,390
Everyone has their own desires.

775
00:40:22,910 --> 00:40:25,320
If you want to live a hard life outside,

776
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:26,910
just live it

777
00:40:26,910 --> 00:40:27,950
honestly.

778
00:40:28,470 --> 00:40:30,520
But Jin Miaocui

779
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:32,080
enjoys it here,

780
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:33,470
living the good life

781
00:40:33,470 --> 00:40:35,230
like a little canary.

782
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:36,710
With just a wave of her hand,

783
00:40:36,710 --> 00:40:38,040
the money comes in.

784
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:40,360
So I'm telling you,

785
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:41,600
just forget about it.

786
00:40:45,150 --> 00:40:46,800
I understand what you mean.

787
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:49,600
Looks like 200 liang isn't enough.

788
00:40:56,630 --> 00:40:58,080
As long as you're willing to let her go,

789
00:40:58,390 --> 00:40:59,520
you name the price.

790
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:01,840
If it's not enough, I'll gather more.

791
00:41:26,710 --> 00:41:27,600
Take the money.

792
00:41:28,670 --> 00:41:30,280
Don't even think about redeeming her.

793
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:32,910
This money is all yours.

794
00:41:33,670 --> 00:41:35,390
Just let me see Miaocui for a moment,

795
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:36,360
is that okay?

796
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:40,000
She's out right now.

797
00:41:40,390 --> 00:41:42,320
That's fine;
I'll wait for her to return.

798
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:44,320
Do you think
Mingke House is just any place

799
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:45,910
where you can see whoever you want

800
00:41:45,910 --> 00:41:47,470
or redeem anyone you wish?

801
00:41:47,670 --> 00:41:48,430
Get out of here!

802
00:41:49,670 --> 00:41:50,840
Go on, get out!

803
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:52,280
Don't waste my time.

804
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:54,000
Get out!

805
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:54,430
Go away!

806
00:41:54,430 --> 00:41:55,040
Madam!

807
00:42:10,910 --> 00:42:11,520
Come in.

808
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:12,470
Okay.

809
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:18,520
Alright, everything's ready.

810
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,950
Do you need something?

811
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:31,840
Uh...

812
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:33,150
Do you know the constable

813
00:42:33,150 --> 00:42:34,190
named Cai?

814
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:36,230
Captain Cai. I know him.

815
00:42:36,670 --> 00:42:37,760
Are you close?

816
00:42:38,190 --> 00:42:39,150
He's my brother.

817
00:42:39,150 --> 00:42:40,150
I'm his sister.

818
00:42:40,150 --> 00:42:41,670
So do you think we're close?

819
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:43,280
What do you need him for?

820
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:44,840
That's good.

821
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:46,360
I'm here on someone's behalf

822
00:42:46,390 --> 00:42:48,040
to give your brother a message.

823
00:42:48,390 --> 00:42:50,040
You can tell me what you want to say.

824
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:51,230
I'll make sure he gets it.

825
00:42:51,470 --> 00:42:52,470
Who sent you?

826
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:54,430
It's Jin Miaocui from Mingke House.

827
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:56,000
She sent me here.

828
00:42:57,150 --> 00:42:58,120
Miaocui.
