[Episode 5]

4
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:34,160
Li Fengchun!

5
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,550
Today, you can't escape!

6
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:37,550
Escape?

7
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:39,720
I never intended to survive.

8
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:41,440
But before I die,

9
00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:44,270
I must kill that wretched child.

10
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,310
Do you have grievances?

11
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:47,160
Let's sit down and talk.

12
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:47,720
Don't move.

13
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:49,120
Don't hurt Mr. Qi.

14
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:49,510
Right...

15
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:50,040
You...

16
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,230
You can't hurt me!

17
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:52,760
I am the governor's son.

18
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:53,230
If you harm me,

19
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:54,190
you will surely die.

20
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:55,590
The governor's son?

21
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:57,950
Good.

22
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,590
Hand over

23
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:00,680
that wretched child.

24
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:03,270
Then I'll let him go.

25
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:05,360
You think I'll be threatened by you?

26
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,080
Try it.

27
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:26,190
No.

28
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,110
Let him see the child.

29
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:32,960
Be careful.

30
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:37,160
Don't come closer.

31
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:37,910
Don't speak.

32
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:44,550
Step back.

33
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,030
Step back.

34
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:55,270
Li Fengchun, don't move.

35
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:56,440
Put down the knife.

36
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:57,830
Or the punishment will be worse.

37
00:02:58,190 --> 00:02:59,030
Today,

38
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:01,830
if I can kill this wretched child,

39
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:03,960
I will die without regret.

40
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,960
Li Fengchun, look closely.

41
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:06,720
Doesn't this child's face

42
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:07,960
look just like yours?

43
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:15,670
Go!

44
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:24,320
What happened?

45
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:26,190
What's going on? I was sleeping.

46
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:27,190
What's wrong?

47
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,600
Quick, come and see.

48
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:29,800
Look.

49
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,320
You can't do it?

50
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:33,160
Feels familiar, doesn't it?

51
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:34,750
You're not mistaken.

52
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:37,160
It's a bond between father and son.

53
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:38,190
No.

54
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:41,000
I won't believe your deceit.

55
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:43,000
It's him.

56
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:43,520
Who?

57
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:44,470
Who?

58
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:46,110
Tell me, who is it?

59
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:48,240
Tell me, who the hell is it?

60
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,830
That seller of sesame candy.

61
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,030
Li Fengchun,

62
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,880
you killed an innocent woman.

63
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,390
Today, you attempt to kill

64
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:57,670
an infant in swaddling clothes.

65
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,390
You're so malicious.

66
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:00,240
Do you plead guilty?

67
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:04,600
She deserved to die.

68
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,270
She was a shameless woman.

69
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:08,750
Committing such a grave crime,

70
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,270
yet still oblivious.

71
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:12,830
I

72
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,320
barely escaped death.

73
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:23,160
Dragging a useless leg,

74
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:26,510
and crawling back from Binzhou,

75
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,040
I only wanted to see her.

76
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,950
But when I returned home,

77
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,230
I found everything had changed.

78
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,320
I inquired everywhere

79
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:00,950
only to learn

80
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,920
she had just heard of my death

81
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:07,350
and remarried.

82
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:14,230
Neighbors,

83
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,480
today my son turns one month old.

84
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:18,230
Please come and drink to the occasion.

85
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:19,880
Congratulations.

86
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:21,070
Congratulations, Lin Xiong.

87
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,270
Congratulations.

88
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,270
Congratulations.

89
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:25,920
Congratulations.

90
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,480
Help yourselves to food and drink.

91
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:28,920
Come on.

92
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,790
Today my son turns one month old.

93
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,720
Thank you all for coming.

94
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,640
Thank you for your presence, cheers!

95
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,480
Congratulations,
Lin Xiong, congratulations.

96
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,720
Let me see the child.

97
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:42,230
Please enjoy your meal.

98
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:44,270
Everyone, come look!

99
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:46,320
This child looks just like Lin Xiong.

100
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:47,920
So chubby and cute.

101
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,040
Look at those eyes,

102
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,720
they're exactly like Lin Xiong's.

103
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:52,320
He truly resembles you.

104
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,070
Of course, he's my son.

105
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:55,510
Lin Xiong.

106
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,000
Have you named him?

107
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:57,670
What's his name?

108
00:05:59,070 --> 00:05:59,670
For a one-month celebration,

109
00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:00,550
this is quite a party.

110
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:03,110
He seems to be enjoying
being a nominal father.

111
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:05,320
You know what?

112
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:06,880
That child is his.

113
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:07,790
Really?

114
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:08,510
Impossible.

115
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:10,000
She gave birth
six months after marrying.

116
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,000
You know what?

117
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:14,040
Lin Xiong told me himself.

118
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:16,390
That Liu Sanniang...

119
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:17,830
Before her husband died,

120
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:19,390
they were already involved.

121
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,510
They got together back then?

122
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:20,760
Yes.

123
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:21,950
What did you think?

124
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:23,390
She was a widow with a child.

125
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:25,070
How could Lin Xiong marry her otherwise?

126
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:26,160
No wonder.

127
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:27,510
Then,

128
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,510
I vowed

129
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:32,390
I would

130
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:34,640
kill this pair of adulterers

131
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,830
to vent my pent-up hatred.

132
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:38,720
Sesame candy.

133
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:40,670
Sweet sesame candy.

134
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,070
Sesame candy.

135
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,950
Sir, please support my business.

136
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:04,070
Buy a pack of sesame candy.

137
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,720
The kids love it.

138
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:09,110
Buy a pack.

139
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:13,040
How much?

140
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,640
Two coins a pack.

141
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:21,950
Alright.

142
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:44,880
What are you doing?

143
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:53,550
Give me the candy!

144
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:09,110
You knew you couldn't match Lin Xiong,

145
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:11,200
so you turned your blade
on the woman and child.

146
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,200
She deserved to die.

147
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,270
She humiliated me.

148
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:16,160
I couldn't kill Lin Xiong,

149
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,920
but I could kill her.

150
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,320
And that bastard in her arms.

151
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,790
I won't spare any of them.

152
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:14,350
Who?

153
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,030
Li Fengchun?

154
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:26,960
Fengchun?

155
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:29,880
Is it you?

156
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:02,110
You're alive.

157
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,910
You're alive.

158
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:12,350
I thought you were dead.

159
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,400
Where have you been?

160
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:21,150
I almost followed you to the grave.

161
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:28,320
Do you know how hard my life has been?

162
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:35,520
Why did it take you so long
to come back?

163
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:41,080
Where have you been?

164
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:43,230
What took you so long?

165
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:54,760
Isn't he on night duty?

166
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,910
Why is he back now?

167
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,550
Fengchun, come here.

168
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:04,030
You...

169
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,150
You, come here.

170
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:07,960
Fengchun,

171
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,230
just hide here.

172
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,200
Why should I hide?

173
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,440
Am I the one with something to hide?

174
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,350
Or have you done something

175
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:13,350
that you should be ashamed of?

176
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:14,230
No.

177
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:17,000
It's not what you think.

178
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:17,710
You...

179
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,150
You listen to me.

180
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:20,910
Please.

181
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:22,230
Just hide here for a moment.

182
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:23,080
Wait a second.

183
00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:24,760
I'll explain everything.

184
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:25,840
You just listen to me.

185
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,760
Wait for me.

186
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:28,590
Wait for me.

187
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:40,030
Xiong said you were home alone.

188
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:40,960
What are you doing?

189
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,320
He asked me to check on you.

190
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,110
What do you want?

191
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,400
I have liked you for a long time.

192
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,200
Just sleep with me.

193
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:45,670
You...

194
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:47,280
What are you doing?

195
00:11:58,520 --> 00:11:59,150
Fengchun.

196
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:02,470
Wretched woman.

197
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:04,280
You shameless hussy.

198
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:22,110
Wretched woman.

199
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:24,590
Wretched woman.

200
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:25,520
Wretched woman.

201
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,110
Why are the gates not bolted?

202
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:08,000
Sanniang,

203
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:09,640
why didn't you bolt the gates?

204
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:23,440
I worked hard every day

205
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,910
to provide her a good life,

206
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:28,640
almost losing my life.

207
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:31,520
But this slut

208
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:34,670
had an affair.

209
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:37,840
Not only did she
get together with Lin Xiong,

210
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,790
but she flaunted it before me,

211
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:42,910
playing lovey-dovey
with some water carrier.

212
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:45,080
I must be blind.

213
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,840
Marrying her was my mistake.

214
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:48,320
You were blind.

215
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,790
You and Liu Sanniang
had been married for years.

216
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:52,960
Didn't you know

217
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,400
what her character was like?

218
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:56,550
You heard some rumors

219
00:13:56,590 --> 00:13:58,000
and believed she cheated.

220
00:13:58,670 --> 00:13:59,880
You couldn't kill a man,

221
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:01,790
so you killed a weak woman
to vent your anger,

222
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:02,640
even attempting

223
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:03,960
to kill your own child.

224
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:05,670
Not only are you blind,

225
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,000
but you're heartless.

226
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:08,280
I don't believe it.

227
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:09,320
You don't believe it?

228
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,440
Then let him tell you.

229
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,000
Xiong.

230
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,440
Dr. Wang told me

231
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:28,280
that the widow
of the Li family was pitiful.

232
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,280
Her husband just died,

233
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:32,080
and she was pregnant.

234
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:34,030
He meant well,

235
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,400
suggesting I marry Sanniang.

236
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:40,760
This way, I could have an heir.

237
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:43,030
Later I found out

238
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,150
that Sanniang had long wanted to die.

239
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:49,230
She had already hung the rope,

240
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:51,960
but then discovered she was pregnant.

241
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:53,550
If you died,

242
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:55,320
Sanniang would fight

243
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,760
to bring your child into the world.

244
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,110
I found Sanniang truly pitiful

245
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,350
and wanted to use the child
to hide my shame,

246
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,400
so I married her.

247
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:07,030
I worried about what others might say.

248
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,910
I never thought my lies

249
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:13,030
would ultimately lead to her death.

250
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,670
Pity for her?

251
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:30,880
My child?

252
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,840
You must be lying.

253
00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:37,840
Just to clear your own name.

254
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,080
You all...

255
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:41,550
You all...

256
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:45,550
You're all deceiving me.

257
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,280
Look closely.

258
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,910
This is your own flesh and blood.

259
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,030
It's the child Liu Sanniang bore

260
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:52,320
even at the cost of her reputation.

261
00:15:52,710 --> 00:15:53,230
No!

262
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:54,400
No!

263
00:15:54,910 --> 00:15:55,320
No!

264
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:56,400
Not my child!

265
00:15:56,590 --> 00:15:57,710
Not my child!

266
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,440
No, not my child!

267
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,470
I'll kill you all!

268
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:02,200
I'll kill you all!

269
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,710
What's going on? He's going to kill?

270
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:08,030
You worthless coward!

271
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:09,150
You dare to kill,

272
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:10,110
but not to admit your mistakes?

273
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:11,230
You keep saying

274
00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:12,320
Liu Sanniang betrayed you.

275
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:13,790
But if you truly cared for her,

276
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:14,550
wouldn't you listen to her explanation

277
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:15,640
before killing her?

278
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:21,000
And you,

279
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:22,550
she was a person,

280
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:25,080
not just an object for your shame.

281
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:28,470
Is your dignity really that valuable?

282
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,150
This is a life.

283
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:32,910
A life.

284
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:37,520
You two

285
00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:39,320
are unworthy of being men.

286
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:54,030
Take him back.

287
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:54,880
Yes.

288
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:55,880
- Let's go.
- Yes.

289
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:56,400
Let's go.

290
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,350
Let me die.

291
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,030
Let me die.

292
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:10,190
I thought you were high and mighty,

293
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:11,710
but you're willing

294
00:17:11,710 --> 00:17:13,000
to stand up for a common woman.

295
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:15,520
Of course.

296
00:17:16,830 --> 00:17:18,430
I act with chivalry.

297
00:17:18,430 --> 00:17:20,040
It's normal to hate evil.

298
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:24,950
You pathetic sissy,

299
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:26,400
you play a ghost so well.

300
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:28,040
Looks like

301
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:29,230
you've never looked in the mirror.

302
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:29,880
You...

303
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:31,430
You...

304
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:32,350
Say that again.

305
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,680
The matter is settled,
yet you want to leave?

306
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:50,560
So much has happened,

307
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,160
can we stay here?

308
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:53,110
That's fine.

309
00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:54,830
Leaving here

310
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:55,830
will spare you and Suo

311
00:17:55,830 --> 00:17:57,470
from the pain of rumors.

312
00:17:58,520 --> 00:17:59,280
I will never let him

313
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,830
grow up in a place of gossip.

314
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:03,710
Since he's a child
sought with all my heart,

315
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:05,520
I will raise him well

316
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:07,950
as a way to atone for my sins.

317
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,310
You're leaving, Lin Xiong?

318
00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:21,190
Take care of the child.

319
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:22,070
Take care.

320
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:23,310
What's with his attitude?

321
00:18:24,430 --> 00:18:25,430
Xiong.

322
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,310
Xiong, what's...?

323
00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:28,430
What's...?

324
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:30,920
What's going on?

325
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,160
Let me say,

326
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:33,400
the one who killed Liu Sanniang

327
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,760
wasn't Li Fengchun,

328
00:18:35,230 --> 00:18:36,310
but Lin Xiong.

329
00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:37,470
Lin Xiong killed her?

330
00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:37,920
That's for sure.

331
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:38,430
Let me tell you,

332
00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:39,430
I even drank with him.

333
00:18:39,430 --> 00:18:40,070
If I had known earlier

334
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:41,950
that he was such a liar,

335
00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:42,430
causing

336
00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:43,710
the ruin of others' families,

337
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:44,560
I would have killed him.

338
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:45,230
What are you doing?

339
00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:46,760
Are you trying to smash my stall?

340
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:47,760
Don't talk nonsense.

341
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:48,470
Go away.

342
00:18:48,590 --> 00:18:50,640
It's such a pity for Liu Sanniang.

343
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:51,350
She was such a good woman.

344
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:52,040
Exactly.

345
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:53,230
Not only was she beautiful,

346
00:18:53,230 --> 00:18:54,310
but she worked efficiently.

347
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:56,160
The key point
is that she had a gentle nature.

348
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:56,800
Exactly.

349
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:58,520
And just like that, she's gone.

350
00:18:58,520 --> 00:18:59,800
What a shame!

351
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,350
If Liu Sanniang married me...

352
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,110
They're the main culprits.

353
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:05,520
They should have their tongues cut out.

354
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:07,430
Before, they spoke ill of Liu Sanniang,

355
00:19:07,430 --> 00:19:08,040
and now look at them,

356
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:09,560
acting all righteous.

357
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:11,350
Can you really cut their tongues?

358
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:11,830
Well,

359
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:13,710
at least scold them properly.

360
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:14,710
And then what?

361
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,350
They can change their ways?

362
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,470
Li Fengchun did kill someone.

363
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:20,680
But where's the root of it?

364
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:22,280
The root is with them.

365
00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:24,800
They gossiped and caused trouble.

366
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,520
Don't they bear any responsibility?

367
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:28,000
We should do something.

368
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:30,950
All we can do

369
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:32,830
is remind ourselves constantly

370
00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:34,000
not to become

371
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,230
one of them.

372
00:19:38,430 --> 00:19:39,680
Let me show you something.

373
00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:45,310
Is it good?

374
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:46,710
Alright then.

375
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:48,560
This matter is settled.

376
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:49,430
Let's go.

377
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:50,280
I'll take you

378
00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:51,880
to the best tavern in Linfen for a meal.

379
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:54,190
Why are you

380
00:19:54,190 --> 00:19:55,760
treating me for no reason?

381
00:19:55,950 --> 00:19:57,800
This matter is truly resolved.

382
00:19:57,830 --> 00:19:58,830
Let me tell you,

383
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,350
this is the most meaningful thing

384
00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:01,520
I've done in my life.

385
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:01,950
Of course, I have to

386
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:03,110
reward myself.

387
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:04,560
And

388
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:05,830
I need to say thank you.

389
00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:07,070
- Thank me?
- Right.

390
00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:07,950
Thank me for what?

391
00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:09,880
Thank you for helping me solve the case.

392
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:11,190
Helping you?

393
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:24,590
Oh no!

394
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:25,880
I overslept again.

395
00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:07,710
Why are you just eating for yourself

396
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:09,190
and not leaving some for me?

397
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:11,680
What time is it now?

398
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:12,950
Do I have to save you some?

399
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:16,160
Why don't you
just lie back on the couch?

400
00:22:16,430 --> 00:22:18,000
I'll feed you myself.

401
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:18,830
How about that?

402
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:21,280
You old thing,

403
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:23,040
you were quick to take money.

404
00:22:23,230 --> 00:22:25,000
If you can't learn to speak properly

405
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:26,040
and act like a person,

406
00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:27,830
quickly pay my sister back.

407
00:22:29,230 --> 00:22:30,680
You despicable thing,

408
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:32,590
you dare to act tough here?

409
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:34,310
If you want someone to serve you,

410
00:22:34,310 --> 00:22:34,880
just get back

411
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,160
to your own place!

412
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:38,640
Say one more word, I dare you.

413
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:39,470
I just said it. What of it?

414
00:22:39,470 --> 00:22:40,640
Say it again, I dare you.

415
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,110
What of it?

416
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:41,680
Say it again.

417
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:42,230
What of it?

418
00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:42,920
Say it again!

419
00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:46,190
I'm not afraid of you! What will you do?

420
00:22:46,310 --> 00:22:46,880
No, stop.

421
00:22:47,470 --> 00:22:48,310
You old hag!

422
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:49,590
You filthy thing!

423
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:51,160
Who are you calling filthy?

424
00:22:51,310 --> 00:22:52,070
Who are you calling filthy?

425
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:52,830
I'm talking about you!

426
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:54,160
You filthy thing!

427
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:56,160
How dare you act tough with me!

428
00:22:56,190 --> 00:22:57,310
Miaocui, calm down.

429
00:22:58,190 --> 00:22:58,760
She's driving me crazy.

430
00:22:58,760 --> 00:22:59,950
You'll catch a cold.

431
00:23:08,710 --> 00:23:10,110
You're laughing at me.

432
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:13,070
Even that old hag is bullying me,

433
00:23:13,070 --> 00:23:14,430
and you still laugh?

434
00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:16,310
You must be starving.

435
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:20,760
Miaocui, calm down.

436
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:21,950
I'll serve you some noodles.

437
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:23,830
Once you eat,

438
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:25,470
you won't be angry anymore.

439
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:28,800
You must be starving.

440
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:33,190
Hurry and eat while it's hot.

441
00:23:33,230 --> 00:23:33,830
Once you're full,

442
00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:34,920
you won't be angry anymore.

443
00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:40,110
It does smell good.

444
00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:41,280
Of course.

445
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:43,190
My brother loves the noodles I make.

446
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:45,520
He eats at least three bowls each meal.

447
00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:49,400
Is it tasty?

448
00:23:52,710 --> 00:23:53,590
Thank you,

449
00:23:53,950 --> 00:23:55,000
Baozi.

450
00:23:57,430 --> 00:23:58,280
Baozi,

451
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,160
how come someone as young as you

452
00:24:00,470 --> 00:24:01,520
is working here

453
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:02,520
as a cook?

454
00:24:04,350 --> 00:24:06,160
I've had a big appetite
since I was little.

455
00:24:06,190 --> 00:24:07,950
I could eat
ten steamed buns in one meal.

456
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:09,950
My parents couldn't afford to raise me,

457
00:24:09,950 --> 00:24:11,520
so they sent me here.

458
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:15,000
But you still gave me so much.

459
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:16,160
I'm fine, really.

460
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:21,430
Look,

461
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:22,560
I still have some pancakes

462
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:23,230
from a few days ago.

463
00:24:49,350 --> 00:24:51,070
You old hag!

464
00:24:53,470 --> 00:24:54,710
I'll fight you!

465
00:24:59,310 --> 00:25:00,400
I'll kill you!

466
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,280
You dare hit me?

467
00:25:21,310 --> 00:25:22,280
You're just...

468
00:25:23,110 --> 00:25:23,920
You dare hit me?

469
00:25:23,950 --> 00:25:24,950
Let me tell you,

470
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:26,430
you'll regret it one day.

471
00:25:26,470 --> 00:25:27,520
Just wait!

472
00:25:32,110 --> 00:25:33,800
Calm down.

473
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:05,430
Miaocui.

474
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:14,710
What's wrong, Miaocui?

475
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:19,230
Who has upset you again?

476
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:22,560
Miaocui.

477
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:25,800
What's going on?

478
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:32,710
You lied to me.

479
00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:35,640
You're just like
those filthy men outside,

480
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:36,880
saying nothing but lies.

481
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:38,590
What happened?

482
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:42,000
You keep saying

483
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:43,800
how great it is

484
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:45,680
outside,

485
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:47,880
but what's the reality?

486
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:51,430
I grew up in Mingke House,

487
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:53,590
and everyone there is of low status.

488
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:54,640
We never looked down

489
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,040
on each other.

490
00:26:57,190 --> 00:26:58,430
But outside,

491
00:26:58,710 --> 00:27:00,350
everyone looks down on me.

492
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:02,230
Even you do.

493
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:05,640
How could I look down on you?

494
00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:08,640
Is it that old woman?

495
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,110
Did she say something hurtful again?

496
00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:13,160
Don't take it to heart.

497
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:15,070
Once we are free...

498
00:27:15,710 --> 00:27:17,190
You can roam outside,

499
00:27:17,590 --> 00:27:19,190
and you won't have to
bear their insults.

500
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:20,710
But what about me?

501
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:22,230
Look at me.

502
00:27:22,230 --> 00:27:22,880
I'm stuck

503
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,400
in this shabby house,

504
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:25,800
staring at

505
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:27,160
that old hag's ugly face.

506
00:27:27,190 --> 00:27:28,520
I'm bullied by her every day.

507
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:31,400
You say

508
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:33,470
not to take it to heart,

509
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:35,400
but how can I not?

510
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:38,520
You make it sound easy.

511
00:27:45,710 --> 00:27:46,880
Alright,

512
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:49,470
I shouldn't have said that.

513
00:27:50,190 --> 00:27:51,110
I know.

514
00:27:52,110 --> 00:27:53,160
You've been

515
00:27:53,830 --> 00:27:55,070
having a hard time lately.

516
00:27:56,430 --> 00:27:57,430
Just hang in there a bit longer.

517
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,230
Once we gain our freedom,

518
00:27:59,430 --> 00:28:00,800
we'll leave this place immediately.

519
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,520
We'll find a better place to live.

520
00:28:04,070 --> 00:28:05,800
But what good would that do?

521
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:09,190
Even if we escape our low status,

522
00:28:10,070 --> 00:28:11,280
my bad reputation

523
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,350
will follow me forever.

524
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:15,470
They will still look down on me.

525
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:36,880
These books

526
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:37,920
are full of

527
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:38,830
useless fluff.

528
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:40,830
If I want to solve a case,

529
00:28:40,950 --> 00:28:42,830
I need to be like that sissy.

530
00:28:43,710 --> 00:28:45,880
Young Master, are you praising him?

531
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:47,680
What nonsense!

532
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:49,000
Why would I praise him?

533
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:49,800
It sounds to me

534
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:51,280
like you admire him.

535
00:28:52,430 --> 00:28:54,190
He looks like a weakling,

536
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:54,880
neither manly nor feminine.

537
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,070
Why would I admire him?

538
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:57,590
If I had spent

539
00:28:57,590 --> 00:28:58,230
just a few years

540
00:28:58,230 --> 00:28:59,350
in the yamen like him,

541
00:28:59,350 --> 00:29:00,560
I would be much better than he is.

542
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:03,190
But he's new here too.

543
00:29:08,590 --> 00:29:09,470
Did I tell you to sleep?

544
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:14,710
Open your eyes.

545
00:29:31,950 --> 00:29:32,760
You sissy.

546
00:29:33,950 --> 00:29:34,760
What a coincidence!

547
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:35,800
Not really.

548
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,680
You're staying in the main house.

549
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:38,830
This is the side courtyard.

550
00:29:38,830 --> 00:29:39,590
No matter where you go,

551
00:29:39,590 --> 00:29:40,590
you won't pass by here.

552
00:29:40,590 --> 00:29:41,350
Unless,

553
00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:42,560
you're doing it on purpose.

554
00:29:46,230 --> 00:29:47,190
For Liu Sanniang's case,

555
00:29:47,190 --> 00:29:48,400
you've done well.

556
00:29:49,430 --> 00:29:50,880
Did Han reward you?

557
00:29:52,430 --> 00:29:53,430
Don't you guys,

558
00:29:53,430 --> 00:29:54,830
have professional training?

559
00:29:54,830 --> 00:29:55,680
Does the yamen

560
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:57,110
teach you any skills for solving cases?

561
00:30:01,310 --> 00:30:02,000
You want to learn?

562
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:04,070
There really is?

563
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:10,470
What is that smell?

564
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:12,430
It is quite unique.

565
00:30:13,470 --> 00:30:14,950
Can you endure hardship, Mr. Qi?

566
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:16,950
I, Qi Menglin,

567
00:30:16,950 --> 00:30:18,110
can handle anything.

568
00:30:20,310 --> 00:30:21,110
Mr. Qi,

569
00:30:21,590 --> 00:30:22,260
this is the mortuary.

570
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:22,640
[Mortuary]
this is the mortuary.

571
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:23,160
[Mortuary]

572
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:24,060
[Mortuary]
Are you afraid to enter?

573
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:24,070
Are you afraid to enter?

574
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:26,040
If you're afraid,

575
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:27,190
you can hide behind me.

576
00:30:27,190 --> 00:30:27,950
I'll go in first.

577
00:30:30,710 --> 00:30:31,520
Wait!

578
00:30:32,430 --> 00:30:33,680
I...

579
00:30:34,230 --> 00:30:35,590
As the son of the governor,

580
00:30:36,310 --> 00:30:37,400
of course not,

581
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:39,110
I won't hide behind you.

582
00:30:39,590 --> 00:30:40,350
I'll go in first.

583
00:30:54,110 --> 00:30:55,350
You sissy, hurry in!

584
00:30:55,590 --> 00:30:56,470
What are you doing?

585
00:30:57,070 --> 00:30:57,920
Come in!

586
00:30:58,710 --> 00:30:59,760
Why did you lock the door?

587
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:00,950
Come in. Stop that now.

588
00:31:00,950 --> 00:31:01,830
Come on, you sissy.

589
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:02,590
You...

590
00:32:55,110 --> 00:32:56,190
Open the door!

591
00:32:56,190 --> 00:32:57,520
Sissy!

592
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:13,350
Help!

593
00:33:13,350 --> 00:33:14,400
You go in!

594
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:16,190
Someone! Help!

595
00:33:16,230 --> 00:33:17,000
Oh no.

596
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:17,760
Someone!

597
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:18,920
You little brat.

598
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:21,710
You think hiding here

599
00:33:21,710 --> 00:33:23,590
will keep me from dealing with you?

600
00:33:24,590 --> 00:33:26,040
How dare you kidnap me here?

601
00:33:26,230 --> 00:33:27,430
Do you know
what the consequences will be?

602
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:29,070
Don't threaten me.

603
00:33:29,350 --> 00:33:30,640
You're hiding here

604
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:31,350
because

605
00:33:31,350 --> 00:33:33,160
you haven't received
your removal papers.

606
00:33:33,830 --> 00:33:35,190
As long as you haven't been freed,

607
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:37,310
you're still mine.

608
00:33:38,710 --> 00:33:41,000
You're hoping they will support you?

609
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:42,760
The honest officials

610
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:44,760
will get entangled

611
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:45,920
with you lowly women?

612
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:47,470
Dream on.

613
00:33:49,070 --> 00:33:49,800
This time,

614
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:51,430
don't think
you can use death to threaten me.

615
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:54,760
Your life is not decided by you.

616
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,520
Gag her and take them away.

617
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:58,800
Young Master.

618
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:01,520
Young Master.

619
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:02,680
Young Master.

620
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:04,430
Young Master.

621
00:34:05,190 --> 00:34:07,230
Open the door!

622
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:08,080
Open the door!

623
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:08,670
Young Master.

624
00:34:09,230 --> 00:34:10,320
Young Master, is that you?

625
00:34:10,630 --> 00:34:11,560
Open the door.

626
00:34:15,390 --> 00:34:15,840
Young Master.

627
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:24,190
Lian Shu!

628
00:34:26,390 --> 00:34:29,080
Why didn't you come earlier?

629
00:34:30,710 --> 00:34:31,520
It's all right now.

630
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:35,600
That sissy.

631
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:37,320
That sissy.

632
00:34:37,950 --> 00:34:38,520
I'll go find him.

633
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:40,950
Let's go.

634
00:34:42,150 --> 00:34:43,520
Be quiet, you hussy.

635
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:46,120
Hurry up!

636
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:47,430
Move faster!

637
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:48,360
Stop!

638
00:34:52,710 --> 00:34:53,670
Your Honor,

639
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:56,520
I'm taking my girls back.

640
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:58,080
I didn't want to disturb you.

641
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:00,040
I'm really sorry.

642
00:35:00,630 --> 00:35:01,390
These two young ladies

643
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:02,670
have already been freed
from their status.

644
00:35:02,710 --> 00:35:03,360
Now they are

645
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:05,000
working here in the yamen,

646
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:07,040
with no ties to Mingke House anymore.

647
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:10,470
Freed from their status?

648
00:35:10,630 --> 00:35:12,630
Then show me the papers.

649
00:35:14,870 --> 00:35:16,280
The papers haven't been approved yet.

650
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:17,630
Once I have them,

651
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:18,600
I will naturally

652
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:19,760
send someone to show you.

653
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,670
Then when you have them,

654
00:35:21,910 --> 00:35:22,910
come back to redeem them.

655
00:35:23,150 --> 00:35:23,360
Let's go.

656
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:24,080
Wait!

657
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:28,910
Your Honor,

658
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:31,760
you took my two dearest girls

659
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,080
under the pretext

660
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:34,470
of solving a case.

661
00:35:34,470 --> 00:35:35,950
Now that the case is solved,

662
00:35:35,950 --> 00:35:36,840
why won't you let me

663
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:38,150
take them back?

664
00:35:38,150 --> 00:35:41,320
Are you trying to forcefully take them?

665
00:35:44,230 --> 00:35:46,150
They are valuable contributors.

666
00:35:46,630 --> 00:35:48,430
I promised to help them
gain their freedom.

667
00:35:49,430 --> 00:35:50,470
I paid good money

668
00:35:50,470 --> 00:35:51,760
to buy them.

669
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:53,800
You can't just say they're free

670
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:55,190
as if you're being generous

671
00:35:55,190 --> 00:35:56,470
with my money.

672
00:36:00,190 --> 00:36:00,760
Fine.

673
00:36:02,150 --> 00:36:03,080
Name your price.

674
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:08,360
You also saw that day,

675
00:36:08,470 --> 00:36:10,630
someone offered 501 liang

676
00:36:10,630 --> 00:36:13,000
for Jin Nang.

677
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:15,520
You're talking nonsense.

678
00:36:16,710 --> 00:36:18,430
Gold has a price, but jade is priceless,

679
00:36:18,430 --> 00:36:20,000
not to mention

680
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,360
two lovely and beautiful young ladies.

681
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:23,950
I've raised them for so long.

682
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:26,710
They are at their most valuable now.

683
00:36:28,630 --> 00:36:30,230
You are an honest official.

684
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:31,870
You can't afford that price.

685
00:36:31,870 --> 00:36:33,520
That's only normal.

686
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:36,760
If you're reluctant,

687
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,630
just visit more often

688
00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:40,320
and help them

689
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,430
with their business.

690
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:42,950
Let's go.

691
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:44,630
Wait! You can't take them away!

692
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:46,670
Why are you getting rough?

693
00:36:46,670 --> 00:36:48,430
Are you trying to forcibly take them?

694
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:57,470
Nonsense!

695
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,040
Breaking into the yamen,

696
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:00,190
are you tired of living?

697
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:01,870
Arrest her!

698
00:37:03,670 --> 00:37:04,840
Baozi, untie them.

699
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:08,600
You officials

700
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:10,080
should uphold the law.

701
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:11,560
What you're doing is robbery.

702
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:12,670
Aren't you forcing the common people

703
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:13,600
Help Miaocui.

704
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:14,910
to go down a dead-end road?

705
00:37:15,670 --> 00:37:16,760
So annoying!

706
00:37:17,950 --> 00:37:18,760
You said

707
00:37:18,870 --> 00:37:20,190
you paid good money

708
00:37:20,190 --> 00:37:21,040
for them.

709
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:22,040
How much did you spend?

710
00:37:22,950 --> 00:37:23,760
I...

711
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:26,320
Sir,

712
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:28,150
I was originally a maid
from a wealthy family.

713
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:30,320
Later,
I followed my master to Mingke House.

714
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:32,360
She never spent a single coin to buy me.

715
00:37:32,390 --> 00:37:33,360
I raised you.

716
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:34,520
Didn't I spend money?

717
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:35,230
I started

718
00:37:35,230 --> 00:37:36,560
performing at 13.

719
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:37,230
I've already earned

720
00:37:37,230 --> 00:37:38,470
plenty for you.

721
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:40,000
Since that's the case,

722
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:43,710
you can take the money

723
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,800
and leave her alone.

724
00:37:48,390 --> 00:37:50,040
Are you joking?

725
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:51,000
Someone offered

726
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,430
501 liang for Jin Nang.

727
00:37:52,430 --> 00:37:52,910
This...

728
00:37:52,910 --> 00:37:53,630
Your Honor,

729
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:56,520
please hear
the case of the brothel madam

730
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:58,360
leading a group to attack the yamen.

731
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,230
No, this...

732
00:38:00,230 --> 00:38:01,520
You can either take the money and leave,

733
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:03,360
or you can weigh

734
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,520
your own guilt.

735
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:15,560
Are you all right?

736
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:21,910
Your Honor, and Mr. Chen,

737
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:23,560
thank you for your help.

738
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:28,910
I will pay for Miaocui's ransom.

739
00:38:29,630 --> 00:38:30,760
Please name your price.

740
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:31,760
No need for that.

741
00:38:34,630 --> 00:38:35,390
I want to go back.

742
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:42,760
What are you talking about?

743
00:38:42,910 --> 00:38:44,320
We just escaped so hard.

744
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:45,840
How can you go back so easily?

745
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:49,040
Mingke House

746
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:49,910
is a hell for you,

747
00:38:51,150 --> 00:38:52,360
but for me,

748
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,080
this place is like hell.

749
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:56,470
It's only temporary here.

750
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:57,560
We can't ruin our lives

751
00:38:57,560 --> 00:38:58,390
because we can't bear

752
00:38:58,390 --> 00:38:59,800
a moment of hardship.

753
00:39:00,150 --> 00:39:01,840
Is leaving here enough?

754
00:39:04,870 --> 00:39:06,600
We'll still have to eat plain food

755
00:39:07,630 --> 00:39:08,520
and endure the disdain of others,

756
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:09,760
won't we?

757
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:12,600
At Mingke House,

758
00:39:13,630 --> 00:39:15,430
at least we have fine clothes and food.

759
00:39:17,390 --> 00:39:18,520
I, Jin Miaocui,

760
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:21,280
want to live a good life.

761
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:24,430
I don't want to struggle anymore.

762
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:26,950
You want a good life?

763
00:39:27,230 --> 00:39:28,190
I can give it to you.

764
00:39:30,670 --> 00:39:32,000
Wuniang gave me a large sum of money

765
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:33,560
before she passed away.

766
00:39:33,630 --> 00:39:34,320
It's enough for us

767
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:36,040
to live our later years without worries.

768
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:37,910
I don't want to live
a hard life anymore.

769
00:39:40,430 --> 00:39:41,040
I know

770
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:42,630
you don't want me to go back.

771
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:46,950
But can you support me for a lifetime?

772
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:49,390
Miaocui,

773
00:39:50,710 --> 00:39:52,390
we have shared hardships.

774
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:55,320
As long as I have food to eat,

775
00:39:55,710 --> 00:39:56,760
you will have too.

776
00:39:57,390 --> 00:39:58,560
If I have a piece of bread,

777
00:39:58,910 --> 00:39:59,950
I will share it with you.

778
00:40:01,230 --> 00:40:02,190
I not only want you

779
00:40:02,190 --> 00:40:03,360
to live well,

780
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:04,320
but I also want to see you

781
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:05,760
married off in style,

782
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:07,000
seeing you happy.

783
00:40:11,630 --> 00:40:12,430
Luo Shu,

784
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:14,870
I know you mean well.

785
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:17,390
But everyone

786
00:40:18,910 --> 00:40:20,360
has their own way of living.

787
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:23,760
The freedom you seek

788
00:40:24,430 --> 00:40:25,870
is not what I want.

789
00:40:27,230 --> 00:40:28,360
I know

790
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:30,040
what kind of life I can live.

791
00:40:31,670 --> 00:40:33,520
During this time away with you,

792
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:36,000
I understand even more

793
00:40:37,430 --> 00:40:39,150
where I belong.

794
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:56,280
Let's each

795
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,280
take care of ourselves.

796
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:05,360
Miaocui!

797
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:41,870
I knew it.

798
00:41:41,870 --> 00:41:43,470
You're not a good person.

799
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:44,870
I didn't expect you to be so despicable.

800
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:46,120
At such a young age,

801
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:46,910
you were flirting so openly,

802
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:48,320
and kept her in the yamen.

803
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:51,470
You're so poor.

804
00:41:51,470 --> 00:41:52,840
What could you use to support her?

805
00:41:54,230 --> 00:41:55,630
Don't tell me
you used your official title

806
00:41:55,630 --> 00:41:56,800
to deceive her.

807
00:41:57,560 --> 00:41:58,390
Now what?

808
00:41:59,000 --> 00:41:59,710
She's gone.

809
00:42:00,190 --> 00:42:01,080
You broke up.

810
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:02,120
It serves you right!

811
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:08,040
So what if I'm poor?

812
00:42:09,430 --> 00:42:11,040
So what if she's a courtesan?

813
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:14,520
Being a courtesan is about making money.

814
00:42:15,230 --> 00:42:16,630
What do you have

815
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:17,840
besides your looks?

816
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:20,360
How much do you have in your pocket?

817
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:27,230
Take this money.

818
00:42:27,470 --> 00:42:28,760
Hurry and catch up with the girl,

819
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:30,190
and make it right with her.

820
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:42,190
As for myself

821
00:42:43,390 --> 00:42:44,760
and the courtesans,

822
00:42:46,190 --> 00:42:48,040
we've ended up like this
due to misfortune.

823
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:50,150
What about you?

824
00:42:51,230 --> 00:42:52,520
You're useless and uneducated,

825
00:42:52,910 --> 00:42:54,280
always riding
on your father's coattails,

826
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:55,000
annoying everyone,

827
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,280
yet feeling so pleased with yourself.
