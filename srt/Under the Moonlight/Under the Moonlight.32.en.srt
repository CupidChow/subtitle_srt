"Jin Nang" by Shui He]

[Episode 32]

4
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:41,830
Qin.

5
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:45,360
You're punctual.

6
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:46,590
Qin,

7
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:51,310
is this all the men you've brought?

8
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:53,480
It's not about quantity, but quality.

9
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:54,800
Besides, I've already

10
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,360
got someone on the inside.

11
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:00,630
Qin, you're truly wise.

12
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:07,160
Yanjin, why do you dress like this?

13
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:13,030
Qin, today I have to trouble you

14
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:14,960
to be the leader at the forefront.

15
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,320
What do you mean?

16
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:18,600
A dozen years ago,

17
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,880
you led your men
to burn down the Luo's house,

18
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,240
achieving great merit.

19
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:24,550
Then you gained my father's trust.

20
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:25,800
Over a decade,

21
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:27,720
the Qi family's support for you

22
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:28,750
stands as proof.

23
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,720
You will lead this action today.

24
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:33,320
I promise,

25
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,550
in the future,

26
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:37,470
I will trust you
as my father did back then.

27
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:37,960
But...

28
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:38,720
Don't you want to continue

29
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,160
cooperating with our family?

30
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:42,910
You have to give something first.

31
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:50,470
Do you expect
to get something for nothing?

32
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,030
I dare not.

33
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,830
I'll leave it to you today.

34
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:57,880
Wait.

35
00:02:58,550 --> 00:02:59,360
What?

36
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:04,800
They'll change the guard in an hour.

37
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,520
That's when we can enter.

38
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:07,720
Why wasn't it

39
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:08,800
in the original plan?

40
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:09,960
I just got the information

41
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,880
from the man on the inside today.

42
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:15,670
Mr. Yanjin.

43
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:24,520
Mr. Yanjin.

44
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,000
Mr. Menglin just stole
the military grain.

45
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,910
Governor asked you
to get him back immediately.

46
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:36,830
Yanjin, do you have any difficulties?

47
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:38,800
Let's go.

48
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:39,960
Yanjin.

49
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,750
What do you think of

50
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,190
Qin Yi's plan?

51
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:51,190
I think it's worth a try.

52
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,720
Qin Yi

53
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:55,670
is indeed calculating.

54
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:05,520
This granary,

55
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:06,960
although it serves as bait,

56
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,830
is where my official fate lies.

57
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:11,000
We can't take it lightly.

58
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:14,550
[Granary]
Must set an ambush with heavy troops.

59
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:16,350
It's fine if Qi Yanjin doesn't come,

60
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:17,110
but if he comes,

61
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,920
we must catch him
in a tight encirclement.

62
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,040
I understand.

63
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,320
If Qi Yanjin

64
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,600
is captured this time,

65
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:29,110
Governor Qi's fall from power

66
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:31,600
will be a foregone conclusion.

67
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,880
Qin Yi's scheme is ingenious

68
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,390
in diverting attention.

69
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,600
Even if Qi Yanjin doesn't fall for it,
Qi Menglin will fall into our trap.

70
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:46,880
We'll profit from both sides.

71
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,110
Luo Shu,

72
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,600
I'll proceed ahead with two grain ships.

73
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,200
You and Han Muzhi return quickly.

74
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:55,350
Let's meet in Linfen

75
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,880
to distribute the grain.

76
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:57,550
Menglin.

77
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,880
How could he have two ships of grain?

78
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:05,720
Mr. Qi is so generous.

79
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:06,830
Where did he get

80
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:07,830
so much grain?

81
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:09,790
I don't know.

82
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:10,950
Could it be that

83
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:12,600
he borrowed it from his father?

84
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,270
Governor Qi is
in charge of military grain,

85
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:15,390
which cannot be used
without authorization.

86
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:17,000
Whether it's military grain or not,

87
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,070
grain ships are already on their way

88
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:19,160
to Linfen.

89
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,200
What are we waiting for?

90
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:20,760
Let's go back.

91
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,720
Let's go back to Linfen.

92
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:33,200
Young Master,

93
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,600
you stole military grain

94
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,720
for Miss Luo.

95
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:37,200
If Master finds out, he will...

96
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:37,950
That's the best.

97
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,390
He will completely disappointed in me,

98
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:42,440
so he won't force me
to inherit the family business,

99
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:45,230
nor will he force me to

100
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,480
marry the granddaughter
of some Minister.

101
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:49,160
So, Young Master,

102
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,350
you were just pretending.

103
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:51,550
I thought you

104
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:53,390
had figured out the consequences
a few days ago.

105
00:05:57,230 --> 00:05:59,040
I've always been clear about it.

106
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,790
Tired? Let's rest for a bit.

107
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:32,230
Why is there so much grain spilled?

108
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,160
What a waste.

109
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,040
Gather it up.

110
00:06:58,390 --> 00:06:59,200
Have some sleep.

111
00:07:56,830 --> 00:07:58,200
Hurry up, faster.

112
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,000
Got it.

113
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:10,600
Order!

114
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,060
[Token of Governor's House, Taiyuan]

115
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,760
Lian Qi, what are you doing here?

116
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:24,720
Does Governor Qi

117
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,790
have any instructions?

118
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:27,000
Did you two release

119
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,160
a batch of military grain today?

120
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,760
Yes. It was taken by Mr. Menglin.

121
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,070
He got the grain requisition document

122
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:32,520
stamped with
Governor Qi's official seal.

123
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:35,150
You two have caused a big trouble.

124
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:36,470
What?

125
00:08:36,670 --> 00:08:38,110
Mr. Menglin's document

126
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:38,790
was fake.

127
00:08:38,910 --> 00:08:39,550
It...

128
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:42,080
How could it be?

129
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,320
Fire.

130
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:45,590
Fire.

131
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,200
Fire.

132
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:49,320
What...

133
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:25,470
A solid dyke can collapse
because of an ant hole in it.

134
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:27,350
Qi Menglin,

135
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:30,320
thanks for helping me.

136
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,520
Hurry up, faster.

137
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:39,470
Yes.

138
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:47,350
I can make it.

139
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:49,760
I will make it.

140
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,550
Who are you on the ship?

141
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:04,960
Which yamen do you belong to?

142
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:06,590
The governor yamen.

143
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:08,230
We're ordered to catch river bandits.

144
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:10,590
We're just passing merchants.

145
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:12,350
We are in a rush,

146
00:10:12,590 --> 00:10:14,030
so we're sailing at night.

147
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:16,910
Officer, please do me a favor.

148
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:18,520
What favor?

149
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:20,030
We're on official duty.

150
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:21,350
Stop the ship immediately.

151
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:23,150
Get on the gangplank for inspection.

152
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,400
Mr. Yanjin, what should we do?

153
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:30,320
Make a dash for it.

154
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:31,230
Got it.

155
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,840
Stop. Stop the ship.

156
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:44,640
Archers, steady.

157
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:49,440
Loose.

158
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:07,280
Save people.

159
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:08,200
Come to save people.

160
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:13,350
Put out the fire.

161
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:13,960
Go.

162
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,320
Put out the fire.

163
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:19,670
Hurry up.

164
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:20,320
Put out the fire.

165
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:22,400
Go.

166
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:23,320
Put out the fire.

167
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,350
Go that way.

168
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:46,470
What happened?

169
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,320
Lian...

170
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:52,440
Lian Qi.

171
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,320
Fire.

172
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:57,440
What...

173
00:11:58,790 --> 00:11:59,880
You. You. You.

174
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:01,280
You three, each take a team.

175
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,320
Go to get fire-fighting equipment

176
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,280
to put out the fire immediately.

177
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,080
Got it.

178
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:04,960
Go.

179
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:07,520
You can go check.

180
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:08,910
We've got this covered.

181
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,000
No.

182
00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:11,640
I can't leave now.

183
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:15,000
It's so strange.

184
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:17,230
Could it be

185
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,280
that someone set the fire?

186
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:54,960
The insider that Mr. Qin mentioned,

187
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,080
is it you?

188
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:02,440
You know too much.

189
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:44,230
Liu Yiqing,

190
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:48,640
you destroyed our Qi family.

191
00:13:57,710 --> 00:13:58,440
A ship is coming from that side.

192
00:13:58,960 --> 00:13:59,880
There's a ship coming!

193
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:00,400
Let's go.

194
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,110
Got work to do, let's go.

195
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,520
There's a ship.

196
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:05,320
Look.

197
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,440
There are two ships.

198
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,440
Two ships are coming from that side.

199
00:14:07,710 --> 00:14:08,960
They sit low in the water.

200
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:10,590
It seems there are goods on the ship.

201
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,110
It seems to be grain.

202
00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:12,910
Grain?

203
00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:14,670
What do you mean by "seems"?

204
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:15,840
That is grain.

205
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,110
Yeah, it's grain.

206
00:14:18,110 --> 00:14:19,280
There's another ship behind.

207
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:20,280
It's true.

208
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:21,640
Luo Shu shouldn't have returned yet.

209
00:14:22,110 --> 00:14:23,030
Once the ship docks,

210
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,400
you go to inform Mr. Chen

211
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,230
to come and take the grain.

212
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:25,960
Got it.

213
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,470
Come on, it's the Qi family's grain.

214
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:32,670
Come here and take a look.

215
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,000
It's the grain sent by the Qi family.

216
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:40,000
The Qi family sent us grain.

217
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,200
Come here and take a look.

218
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:44,030
No rush.

219
00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:45,000
Hold on.

220
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:45,840
Excuse me.

221
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,000
Wait.

222
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,400
Everyone, please wait.

223
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:52,280
Everyone.

224
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:54,030
Everyone.

225
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:55,080
Take it easy.

226
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,590
We're going to send grain

227
00:14:56,590 --> 00:14:58,520
to the yamen for counting.

228
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,910
Please go back

229
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:01,880
and wait for notice.

230
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:03,150
Once we've finished counting,

231
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:05,230
we will inform you
to come get the grain.

232
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:10,760
Mr. Qi,

233
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:12,670
you are the savior of Linfen.

234
00:15:12,670 --> 00:15:13,840
These two ships of grain

235
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:14,550
have truly solved

236
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:16,280
Linfen's urgent need.

237
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,790
Chen, don't say that.

238
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:20,110
We want grain right now.

239
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:22,320
If you take away the grain,

240
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,670
who knows if you'll give us anymore?

241
00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:25,280
Exactly.

242
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,670
Maybe he will

243
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:28,840
hide the grain.

244
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:30,710
Everyone.

245
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,200
Listen to me.

246
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:35,030
I'm the the deputy magistrate of Linfen.

247
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:36,670
I promise.

248
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:39,030
Today or at the latest tomorrow,

249
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,910
we'll definitely distribute the grain.

250
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,280
If anyone doesn't believe it,

251
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:44,000
they can wait at the yamen's gate.

252
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:50,960
Don't believe him! Grab it!

253
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:52,030
Grab it!

254
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:57,790
Grab the grain!

255
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:01,790
Grab the grain!

256
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:08,030
It's mine, out of my way.

257
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:10,400
Out of my way.

258
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:11,320
Go up.

259
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:14,440
Everyone.

260
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,150
Everyone, stop.

261
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,520
Look what this is.

262
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:19,760
There's no grain, only rice husks.

263
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,400
Rice husks?

264
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:23,000
How could it be?

265
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,670
Where's the grain?

266
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:25,150
Check out.

267
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:26,710
Check if they are rice husks.

268
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:28,080
Rice husks.

269
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:28,760
All rice husks!

270
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:30,440
That's not grain.

271
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:32,670
How could it be?

272
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:33,760
Where's the grain?

273
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:34,230
Everyone.

274
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:36,400
It's him. This guy

275
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,910
switched our grain.

276
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:38,880
Beat him up!

277
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:39,790
Beat him up!

278
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:49,910
That's impossible.

279
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:50,880
Qi Menglin,

280
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,470
how did the grain turn into rice husks?

281
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:54,000
Come back with me to the yamen
for interrogation. Arrest him!

282
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:55,280
Move.

283
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:00,320
Lian Shu.

284
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,280
What about Lian Shu?

285
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:01,710
Don't worry.

286
00:17:01,710 --> 00:17:03,150
He'll be fine after you leave.

287
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:07,680
Yanjin.

288
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,520
You're alive!

289
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:10,920
Come on.

290
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:11,520
Father.

291
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:12,230
Sit here.

292
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:15,520
You two

293
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:17,110
guard at the doorway.

294
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:19,160
Keep a close watch.

295
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:19,560
Got it.

296
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:20,190
Go.

297
00:17:21,350 --> 00:17:23,230
Yanjin, are you alright?

298
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:25,190
Father,

299
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,470
I'm sorry I failed.

300
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:28,800
What are you talking about?

301
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:30,760
I know

302
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:32,350
you've done your best.

303
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:34,230
It's already lucky

304
00:17:34,230 --> 00:17:35,680
that you managed to escape.

305
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:38,000
If anyone's to blame,

306
00:17:39,430 --> 00:17:41,430
then blame me for being too ambitious.

307
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:43,350
I thought I could
beat them at their own game,

308
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:44,760
and settle it once and for all.

309
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:46,310
I didn't expect

310
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:50,230
to fall into a chain of stratagems.

311
00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:55,470
The Liu family is really gonna

312
00:17:55,470 --> 00:17:57,430
destroy our Qi family.

313
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:03,800
Yanjin.

314
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:08,110
Do you know

315
00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:09,110
who set fire to the granary?

316
00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:11,920
Who is it?

317
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:17,470
Lian Qi.

318
00:18:21,590 --> 00:18:22,640
Lian Qi?

319
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:24,040
Yes.

320
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:27,190
Lian Qi.

321
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:31,070
This move is so ruthless.

322
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,590
It could make our family

323
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:37,640
never rise again.

324
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:43,950
Everyone knows

325
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:47,040
that Lian Qi is one of our men.

326
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:51,000
He's your trusted aide.

327
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,830
Lian Qi has been with us for years,

328
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:58,880
but I never knew he was a spy.

329
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,430
It's my fault for being blind.

330
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,230
I put you in that place.

331
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:04,950
Yanjin.

332
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,920
How can I blame you for this?

333
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:14,190
This is our Qi family's fate.

334
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:18,710
Menglin took away the military grain.

335
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:21,800
The granary was burned down.

336
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:24,190
They'll definitely accuse me of

337
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:27,310
embezzling military grain.

338
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:32,710
The news from the capital

339
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:35,400
will arrive soon.

340
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:38,680
Yanjin.

341
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:41,430
Listen to me.

342
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:43,230
You can't stay here.

343
00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:45,000
You must leave right now.

344
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,110
Go.

345
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:46,830
No.

346
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:48,640
Let me escort you.

347
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:49,800
Let's leave together.

348
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:52,280
You escort me?

349
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:57,520
As an imperial official,

350
00:19:58,430 --> 00:20:00,400
where can I hide?

351
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:04,640
Besides, your grandmother

352
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,710
and the rest of the family are here.

353
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,430
I'm the head of the Qi family.

354
00:20:09,470 --> 00:20:11,280
I should stay

355
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,950
and face the consequences.

356
00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:17,470
I can't leave.

357
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,350
Then I'll stay with you.

358
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:25,070
No matter what happens,

359
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,400
I'll stay with you

360
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:30,070
to protect the Qi family.

361
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:41,760
Son.

362
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:45,110
With your words,

363
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:49,040
I'm already satisfied.

364
00:20:50,430 --> 00:20:52,000
Fengzhou has passed away.

365
00:20:52,590 --> 00:20:56,230
Menglin is rebellious,

366
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:57,590
but

367
00:20:58,430 --> 00:21:00,830
I can't protect him anymore.

368
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:03,230
For all these years,

369
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,880
I've supported Fengzhou

370
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,310
and spoiled Menglin,

371
00:21:08,430 --> 00:21:10,680
but neglected you.

372
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:14,430
But I know

373
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:18,230
that you've helped me the most

374
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,560
and contributed the most

375
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:21,640
to the Qi family.

376
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:26,560
I owe you too much.

377
00:21:27,310 --> 00:21:28,040
God

378
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:30,160
won't give me another chance

379
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:32,880
to make it up to you.

380
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:35,800
Father,

381
00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:40,590
I've never felt that you owe me.

382
00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:44,400
I'm so satisfied

383
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:47,070
to share your concerns

384
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:51,830
and contribute to our Qi family.

385
00:22:00,950 --> 00:22:02,430
My good son.

386
00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:17,160
Yanjin.

387
00:22:19,710 --> 00:22:21,110
The Qi family has fallen.

388
00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:30,230
We've really fallen this time.

389
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:32,950
Let me

390
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:36,070
take care of the mess.

391
00:22:36,710 --> 00:22:37,710
That's the last thing

392
00:22:37,710 --> 00:22:39,160
I can do

393
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:41,190
for the Qi family.

394
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:46,710
Yanjin, my son.

395
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,520
Promise me one thing,

396
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:50,310
okay?

397
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,190
Okay.

398
00:22:54,710 --> 00:22:57,710
Even if you have to be incognito,

399
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:01,310
you must live well

400
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:03,520
and continue

401
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,230
the family line.

402
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:06,800
Do you hear me?

403
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:12,040
In this way, even if I die,

404
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:15,560
I will have no regrets.

405
00:23:20,950 --> 00:23:21,760
Great.

406
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:26,230
Get up.

407
00:23:27,230 --> 00:23:28,040
Get up.

408
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:36,760
Go, right now.

409
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:38,400
Or it will be too late.

410
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,310
Listen to me.

411
00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:42,350
You have to leave right now.

412
00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:42,950
I know

413
00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:44,190
you're the most filial son.

414
00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:45,070
Go.

415
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:46,070
Go.

416
00:23:47,110 --> 00:23:48,040
Go.

417
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:58,560
Father.

418
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:44,800
Mr. Liu.

419
00:24:45,470 --> 00:24:48,470
Isn't Qin Yi ruthless enough?

420
00:24:50,350 --> 00:24:51,920
Qin Yi is someone

421
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:55,710
who can be used but not relied upon.

422
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:01,040
We haven't completely
wiped out the Qi family.

423
00:25:02,590 --> 00:25:04,000
It's still a hidden trouble.

424
00:25:05,310 --> 00:25:07,560
We need him to do the dirty work

425
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:09,520
for us.

426
00:25:14,830 --> 00:25:16,920
You've thought of everything.

427
00:25:21,710 --> 00:25:22,590
This.

428
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:27,590
Allocate the relief grain to Linfen.

429
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:44,340
[Relief grain]

430
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:45,640
I've finally arrived.

431
00:25:47,710 --> 00:25:48,520
Come on.

432
00:25:50,350 --> 00:25:51,160
Captain Cai.

433
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:56,520
Your Honor, Luo Shu.

434
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:57,710
Why are you here?

435
00:25:57,710 --> 00:25:58,110
How did you know

436
00:25:58,110 --> 00:25:59,310
when we would come back?

437
00:25:59,590 --> 00:26:00,280
Mr. Chen asked me

438
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:01,280
to wait for you here.

439
00:26:01,430 --> 00:26:02,560
What happened?

440
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:26,590
When I got on the ship,

441
00:26:26,590 --> 00:26:27,880
I saw grain.

442
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:30,560
But when we arrived in Linfen,
it turned into rice husks.

443
00:26:31,710 --> 00:26:32,830
I still don't understand

444
00:26:32,830 --> 00:26:33,880
what exactly happened.

445
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,000
Maybe all of this was a setup,

446
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:37,400
a conspiracy

447
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:38,430
to destroy the Qi family.

448
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:42,400
Maybe they started planning this

449
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,950
when the famine in Linfen began.

450
00:26:45,110 --> 00:26:45,920
Who are they?

451
00:26:46,310 --> 00:26:48,310
Mr. Liu and Qin Yi.

452
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,230
Mr. Liu has been

453
00:26:53,230 --> 00:26:54,190
my father's political opponent
for years.

454
00:26:55,070 --> 00:26:56,040
As for Qin Yi,

455
00:26:57,070 --> 00:26:58,430
our family cut off his source of income,

456
00:26:59,430 --> 00:27:00,350
so he wanted revenge.

457
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:01,830
We just solved

458
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:02,950
the locust plague in Linfen,

459
00:27:03,710 --> 00:27:04,760
refugees from the surrounding areas

460
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:06,760
started flooding into Linfen.

461
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:08,400
There must be someone behind this.

462
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:10,470
Magistrate Han wrote for grain
but got no response,

463
00:27:10,710 --> 00:27:12,280
so he went to Taiyuan to ask for grain.

464
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,430
But Mr. Liu kept putting him off.

465
00:27:15,830 --> 00:27:16,830
Coincidentally,

466
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:18,310
all the grain in Taiyuan

467
00:27:18,310 --> 00:27:20,190
was controlled by Qin Yi.

468
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:21,640
They knew about

469
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:22,920
your connection to Linfen.

470
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:24,520
They knew you wouldn't just stand by.

471
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:26,280
This whole setup

472
00:27:27,070 --> 00:27:28,880
was to lure you into
embezzling military grain

473
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:30,800
and framing Governor Qi.

474
00:27:32,830 --> 00:27:34,230
Just two ships of grain.

475
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:35,400
There's plenty of grain in Taiyuanwei.

476
00:27:35,830 --> 00:27:36,560
Besides,

477
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:37,830
I was helping the people.

478
00:27:39,430 --> 00:27:41,110
Even if the imperial court
investigates it,

479
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:42,110
well,

480
00:27:42,110 --> 00:27:43,110
I'll take the blame.

481
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:44,640
Trying to frame my father?

482
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:45,590
Not that easy.

483
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:49,560
Last night,

484
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,160
the granary in Taiyuanwei
was burned down.

485
00:27:52,710 --> 00:27:53,520
What?

486
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:55,920
You took away
the military grain secretly,

487
00:27:55,950 --> 00:27:56,920
the granary was burned down,

488
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:58,680
and the grain turned into rice husks

489
00:27:58,680 --> 00:27:59,680
in plain sight.

490
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:00,950
Now they can rightfully

491
00:28:00,950 --> 00:28:02,830
impeach Governor Qi for misappropriating

492
00:28:02,830 --> 00:28:04,520
and even embezzling military grain.

493
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:05,560
No.

494
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:08,160
No, I have to go back to Taiyuan.

495
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:08,920
What can you do

496
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:09,920
by going back now?

497
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,040
I took away the military grain.

498
00:28:12,350 --> 00:28:13,590
I can testify for my father.

499
00:28:13,710 --> 00:28:14,430
Mr. Liu and Qin Yi

500
00:28:14,430 --> 00:28:15,710
made such a rigorous plan.

501
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,520
They must have a backup
against the Qi family.

502
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:18,230
If you go back now,

503
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:19,230
you'll walk into their trap.

504
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:19,830
Fengzhou

505
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:20,830
was killed by them.

506
00:28:20,830 --> 00:28:22,000
Now my father is in trouble,

507
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,040
how can I stay out of it?

508
00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:23,830
Stop.

509
00:28:24,230 --> 00:28:25,000
If you go back,

510
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,310
you won't be able to
save the Qi family at all.

511
00:28:26,430 --> 00:28:27,190
You're heading

512
00:28:27,190 --> 00:28:28,680
for your doom.

513
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:35,640
Then I'll accept it.

514
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,350
That's my fate.

515
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,190
For all these years,

516
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:44,830
it's time for me

517
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:47,710
to pay for our sins.

518
00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:50,350
Fine,

519
00:28:50,950 --> 00:28:52,110
if you want to die,

520
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:53,520
I'll go with you.

521
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:55,230
I'll go back to Taiyuan with you.

522
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,880
This is none of your business.

523
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:11,000
From now on, you go your way,

524
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:13,000
I'll go mine.

525
00:29:14,070 --> 00:29:15,070
None of my business?

526
00:29:16,230 --> 00:29:17,800
Then who was it you risked your life

527
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:18,800
to take the military grain for?

528
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:19,430
I...

529
00:29:22,110 --> 00:29:22,800
Of course, I did it

530
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:23,830
for the people of Linfen.

531
00:29:24,950 --> 00:29:25,640
Since when

532
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:26,920
did you become so selfless?

533
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:29,800
So in your heart,

534
00:29:32,430 --> 00:29:33,680
I'm just a selfish

535
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:34,680
and irresponsible playboy?

536
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:35,710
You don't need to provoke me.

537
00:29:36,430 --> 00:29:37,560
I'm not leaving.

538
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:39,800
I said before

539
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:41,950
once I've set my heart on you,

540
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:45,040
I'll be with you

541
00:29:45,430 --> 00:29:46,400
till the end of my life.

542
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:51,880
I'm not worth you doing this.

543
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:57,110
Worth or not, that's for me to decide.

544
00:30:03,310 --> 00:30:04,230
Disgusting!

545
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:06,310
So disgusting.

546
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:08,640
The relief grain,
rice husks and the fire.

547
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,920
These are all his traps.

548
00:30:10,430 --> 00:30:12,110
The grain was all burned down.

549
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:13,350
There is no evidence at all.

550
00:30:13,710 --> 00:30:15,680
I'm afraid even before
the locust plague began,

551
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:17,280
Mr. Liu had already

552
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:18,710
planned everything.

553
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:23,000
What a grand scheme!

554
00:30:24,350 --> 00:30:26,000
I haven't noticed at all.

555
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:28,040
Muzhi, it's not your fault.

556
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:30,040
I know they are political opponents.

557
00:30:30,430 --> 00:30:31,190
I know Mr. Liu will

558
00:30:31,190 --> 00:30:33,000
lay hands on Governor Qi someday.

559
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,230
I also know those in high positions

560
00:30:34,230 --> 00:30:35,640
are not kind people.

561
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:37,040
But I overestimated

562
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:38,040
their bottom line.

563
00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:38,880
Meiqing.

564
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:40,430
Isn't it an official's duty

565
00:30:40,430 --> 00:30:42,280
to serve the country and the people?

566
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:43,830
In their hearts,

567
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:44,800
is playing power politics and intrigue

568
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:46,280
more important

569
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:47,230
than the lives of countless people?

570
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:48,800
Have they ever thought about

571
00:30:48,830 --> 00:30:50,800
the numerous victims in Shanxi?

572
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:51,430
This is a full

573
00:30:51,430 --> 00:30:53,350
warehouse of grain.

574
00:30:55,310 --> 00:30:57,350
It was just burned down.

575
00:30:59,430 --> 00:31:00,280
Muzhi,

576
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:03,040
now we should think about

577
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:04,640
how to solve the famine.

578
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:05,950
Without food,

579
00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:07,830
the number of people
starving to death every day

580
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,110
will only continue to increase.

581
00:31:12,830 --> 00:31:14,040
Your Honor, Mr. Chen,

582
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:17,230
Mr. Liu is distributing
the relief grain.

583
00:31:17,230 --> 00:31:18,470
The grain ships are at the ferry.

584
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:22,070
Their scheme has succeeded.

585
00:31:22,070 --> 00:31:23,560
Now they're willing to
distribute the grain.

586
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:24,710
No matter what,

587
00:31:24,710 --> 00:31:26,000
it's a good thing.

588
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,400
People will be saved.

589
00:31:29,070 --> 00:31:29,880
Luo Shu,

590
00:31:30,350 --> 00:31:31,640
how is Mr. Qi?

591
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:33,350
He's been through
such a terrible change.

592
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:34,880
It's natural he was a bit worked up.

593
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:35,470
But now

594
00:31:35,470 --> 00:31:36,830
he's calmed down.

595
00:31:37,110 --> 00:31:37,640
Okay.

596
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:39,590
I'll ask Cai Baozi

597
00:31:39,590 --> 00:31:40,350
to make some dishes

598
00:31:40,350 --> 00:31:41,280
to him.

599
00:31:41,350 --> 00:31:42,350
Thank you, Your Honor.

600
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:46,000
Just keep him in there.

601
00:31:46,350 --> 00:31:47,040
Now,

602
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:48,470
it's safer inside.

603
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:52,680
Let's go to the ferry
to take the grain.

604
00:31:56,350 --> 00:31:58,430
Everyone, look.

605
00:31:58,430 --> 00:31:59,160
The grain

606
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:00,590
is sent by Mr. Liu.

607
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:03,190
It's Mr. Liu.

608
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:05,280
Not like Governor Qi

609
00:32:05,470 --> 00:32:06,830
who stole our grain

610
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:08,000
and let us starve.

611
00:32:08,230 --> 00:32:09,230
Am I right?

612
00:32:09,230 --> 00:32:09,920
Yeah.

613
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:16,950
Miss Luo,

614
00:32:16,950 --> 00:32:18,160
I was going to find you.

615
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:19,430
Mr. Qi is gone.

616
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:20,560
Gone?

617
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:22,430
I just went to send dishes to him,

618
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:23,950
but I found that he was gone.

619
00:32:24,350 --> 00:32:25,560
Then I asked the guard

620
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:27,430
who told me that Mr. Qi had left.

621
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:32,590
Your Honor,

622
00:32:32,710 --> 00:32:33,350
do you know

623
00:32:33,350 --> 00:32:34,640
Qi Menglin has left?

624
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:44,160
I know.

625
00:32:45,950 --> 00:32:47,680
If you go back, you'll die.

626
00:32:48,590 --> 00:32:49,560
But

627
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:50,590
what's the meaning

628
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:52,920
of living like this?

629
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:55,430
At least in Linfen,

630
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:56,710
I can protect you.

631
00:32:57,520 --> 00:32:58,350
If you leave Linfen...

632
00:32:58,430 --> 00:32:59,230
Han,

633
00:33:00,710 --> 00:33:01,430
I know

634
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,520
going back to Taiyuan
means certain death.

635
00:33:07,590 --> 00:33:08,710
But I have no choice.

636
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:10,800
Have you ever thought that

637
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:11,710
if you go back,

638
00:33:11,710 --> 00:33:12,880
what about Luo Shu?

639
00:33:15,110 --> 00:33:15,920
Han,

640
00:33:19,350 --> 00:33:20,310
I asked you to come here

641
00:33:21,830 --> 00:33:23,000
because I have something important

642
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,000
to ask you for help.

643
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:28,680
Please take care of Luo Shu.

644
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:33,070
I entrust her to you.

645
00:33:35,230 --> 00:33:36,310
You love her and are worthy of her.

646
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:39,230
I can rest assured.

647
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:44,190
Stupid.

648
00:33:45,470 --> 00:33:46,400
I'll go find him.

649
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:47,110
Luo Shu.

650
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:49,560
Mr. Qi didn't mean it that way.

651
00:33:50,710 --> 00:33:51,430
If he goes back,

652
00:33:51,430 --> 00:33:52,880
he'll probably be in great danger.

653
00:33:53,230 --> 00:33:54,400
Mr. Liu must have

654
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:54,950
set up a big trap,

655
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:56,560
waiting for members of the Qi family.

656
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:57,880
If you go back,

657
00:33:58,230 --> 00:33:59,520
Qin Yi won't let you go.

658
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:04,560
Your Honor,

659
00:34:05,350 --> 00:34:06,950
I know you're trying to protect me,

660
00:34:07,830 --> 00:34:09,360
but I must go to Taiyuan.

661
00:34:09,950 --> 00:34:11,760
No matter what is ahead,

662
00:34:12,670 --> 00:34:14,320
I will go with him through it.

663
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:18,080
Have you made up your mind?

664
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:21,910
I go wherever he goes.

665
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:24,040
Okay.

666
00:34:25,150 --> 00:34:26,430
There are no boats today.

667
00:34:26,710 --> 00:34:27,600
Go tomorrow.

668
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:30,150
If you encounter any difficulties,

669
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:32,150
try to come back to Linfen.

670
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:34,430
Thanks, Your Honor.

671
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:44,180
[Taiyuan]

672
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:48,520
Master.

673
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:00,600
Lian Qi,

674
00:35:03,950 --> 00:35:05,600
I didn't expect you
to be undercover in the Qi family

675
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:06,560
for so many years.

676
00:35:07,390 --> 00:35:08,120
You've been through a lot.

677
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:10,080
Thanks to your guidance,

678
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:11,600
I've been able to gain trust

679
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:12,910
within the Qi family.

680
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:13,910
We are brothers.

681
00:35:13,910 --> 00:35:15,280
We were sold to different places
since childhood.

682
00:35:16,230 --> 00:35:18,000
With all efforts,

683
00:35:18,470 --> 00:35:19,870
I finally found you.

684
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:22,120
I thought

685
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:23,840
you were a backup

686
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:24,870
to stabilize the Qi family.

687
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:28,040
But I didn't expect you to become

688
00:35:28,390 --> 00:35:30,040
a sharp weapon against the Qi family.

689
00:35:31,470 --> 00:35:32,600
From now on,

690
00:35:32,670 --> 00:35:34,230
you and I are united,

691
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:36,040
we will be unstoppable.

692
00:35:36,630 --> 00:35:38,040
You and I are united

693
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:40,870
to destroy the Qi family.

694
00:35:46,390 --> 00:35:47,190
Peng Cheng.

695
00:35:47,430 --> 00:35:48,230
I'm here.

696
00:35:49,950 --> 00:35:51,760
I'll leave the rest to you.

697
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:53,390
Yes.

698
00:35:53,710 --> 00:35:54,760
I'll leave for Linfen right away

699
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:57,120
to kill Qi Menglin.

700
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:59,000
I know him well.

701
00:36:00,190 --> 00:36:01,800
He won't run away on his own.

702
00:36:02,430 --> 00:36:03,840
He will definitely come back.

703
00:36:04,950 --> 00:36:06,190
As for Luo Shu,

704
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,430
she will come back too.

705
00:36:10,470 --> 00:36:11,430
You may leave now.

706
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:12,390
Got it.

707
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:22,950
Where

708
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:25,280
do you think Qi Yanjin will hide?

709
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:29,710
Qi Yanjin practices cultivation
and martial arts.

710
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,470
He has some martial friends.

711
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:34,430
I think he should be

712
00:36:34,430 --> 00:36:36,280
seeking refuge
with one of his friends now.

713
00:36:36,710 --> 00:36:37,910
Then you go to

714
00:36:37,910 --> 00:36:39,600
those places to look for him.

715
00:36:40,150 --> 00:36:41,800
Once you have trace of him,

716
00:36:42,910 --> 00:36:44,040
don't take action on your own

717
00:36:45,190 --> 00:36:46,360
to avoid hurting yourself.

718
00:36:49,230 --> 00:36:50,230
Don't worry.

719
00:37:07,150 --> 00:37:08,470
Officer, please.

720
00:37:09,390 --> 00:37:10,040
Okay.

721
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,470
Please keep a closer eye on it.

722
00:37:14,470 --> 00:37:15,230
It's my duty.

723
00:37:18,430 --> 00:37:19,390
My eggs.

724
00:37:19,390 --> 00:37:20,520
You pay me.

725
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:21,280
These eggs

726
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,600
are for my husband to nourish his body.

727
00:37:23,670 --> 00:37:24,840
You can't go.

728
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:25,430
You pay me.

729
00:37:25,430 --> 00:37:25,910
You broke my eggs.

730
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:26,800
Please keep your voice down.

731
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:27,430
You pay me.

732
00:37:27,430 --> 00:37:28,000
Darling.

733
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:28,760
You pay me.

734
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:29,840
What are you doing here?

735
00:37:29,910 --> 00:37:30,710
Hey,

736
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:32,670
since the eggs are already broken,

737
00:37:32,670 --> 00:37:33,560
take this.

738
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:34,600
What are you arguing about?

739
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:38,150
Nothing.

740
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:39,230
My husband

741
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:40,430
broke this lady's

742
00:37:40,430 --> 00:37:41,320
eggs.

743
00:37:41,470 --> 00:37:43,040
We got separated
when we were out of the city.

744
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:44,080
You fool.

745
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:44,950
I've already left.

746
00:37:44,950 --> 00:37:46,430
Why did you come back to look for me?

747
00:37:47,230 --> 00:37:48,470
Look at you,

748
00:37:48,470 --> 00:37:49,710
so absent-minded,

749
00:37:49,710 --> 00:37:51,040
and easily distracted.

750
00:37:51,150 --> 00:37:52,670
You disappeared into the crowd
without a trace.

751
00:37:52,670 --> 00:37:53,560
Who is more important?

752
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:54,840
Me or rubbernecking?

753
00:37:54,870 --> 00:37:55,600
Just wait and see

754
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:56,560
what I'll do to you when we get back.

755
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:57,910
Stop it, go away.

756
00:37:58,150 --> 00:37:59,190
Got it. Let's go.

757
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:01,280
You just go.

758
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:02,280
I can handle it myself.

759
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:04,800
Do you even believe that?

760
00:38:05,430 --> 00:38:06,800
It's hard for you to show your face now.

761
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,150
How are you gonna handle it yourself?

762
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:09,520
Don't you worry that being stubborn

763
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:10,560
might delay saving your family?

764
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,430
I know you don't want to
drag me into this.

765
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:21,000
But instead of

766
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:21,840
wasting your breath with me,

767
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:23,120
you should think about

768
00:38:23,430 --> 00:38:24,190
how to investigate

769
00:38:24,190 --> 00:38:25,560
this rice husks case.

770
00:38:29,470 --> 00:38:30,390
If anything happens to me,

771
00:38:31,190 --> 00:38:31,950
I'll risk my life

772
00:38:31,950 --> 00:38:33,040
without dragging you into it.

773
00:38:34,670 --> 00:38:35,470
Don't worry,

774
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:37,670
we won't end up in that situation.

775
00:38:38,670 --> 00:38:40,080
Right now, we should think about

776
00:38:40,950 --> 00:38:41,870
how to get into the city.

777
00:39:02,190 --> 00:39:03,320
What about your dreams?

778
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:04,800
What about your ambitions?

779
00:39:05,230 --> 00:39:06,800
Such a great future.

780
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:08,040
How many people would kill for it!

781
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:09,040
But you

782
00:39:09,950 --> 00:39:12,190
want to resign.

783
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:17,120
What am I supposed to do if you leave?

784
00:39:17,470 --> 00:39:18,600
What about the people of Linfen?

785
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:20,080
Have you ever thought about that?

786
00:39:20,910 --> 00:39:21,870
Besides,

787
00:39:22,190 --> 00:39:24,000
Mr. Qi is in trouble now,

788
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,670
and Luo Shu has gone with him.

789
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:28,630
What if they need help?

790
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:30,360
With your position in the yamen,

791
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:32,150
you still have some influence.

792
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:33,760
If you were just an ordinary person,

793
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:35,560
how could you help them?

794
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:44,760
Muzhi,

795
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:45,320
are you

796
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:47,000
listening to me?

797
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:47,950
I am the magistrate,

798
00:39:48,430 --> 00:39:49,320
so what?

799
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:50,760
Who can I help?

800
00:39:50,950 --> 00:39:52,560
I know you mean well,

801
00:39:52,670 --> 00:39:53,600
but this officialdom,

802
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:54,190
I, Han Muzhi,

803
00:39:54,190 --> 00:39:56,080
can't stay in it for another day.

804
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:58,120
I've made up my mind.

805
00:39:58,390 --> 00:39:59,630
Don't persuade me anymore.

806
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:01,470
Someone.

807
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:05,910
Your Honor.

808
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:08,840
Send this letter
to the prefecture yamen.

809
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:24,560
Take a step back.

810
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:38,870
Are you moving or not?

811
00:40:40,430 --> 00:40:41,320
Just go.

812
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:43,600
Don't block the way.

813
00:40:45,390 --> 00:40:46,320
What the hell?

814
00:40:47,190 --> 00:40:47,800
You,

815
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:49,390
wait.

816
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:55,230
Open the box.

817
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:57,360
Officer,

818
00:40:57,630 --> 00:40:59,430
I'm coming into the city to sell goods.

819
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:00,710
It's all goods in here.

820
00:41:00,710 --> 00:41:02,000
Nothing else.

821
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,520
Open the box.

822
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:04,280
Open it.

823
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:05,840
Please don't.

824
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:14,470
I told you.

825
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:15,230
These are

826
00:41:15,230 --> 00:41:16,320
all women's clothes.

827
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:18,230
It's not convenient for you to see.

828
00:41:22,710 --> 00:41:23,670
Alright.

829
00:41:24,630 --> 00:41:25,840
Pick them up,

830
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:26,760
and leave.

831
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:42,910
Father.

832
00:41:47,870 --> 00:41:49,000
Take a look yourself.

833
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:51,900
[To Mr. Zhao]

834
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:57,320
This is the man you choose.

835
00:42:01,710 --> 00:42:03,150
It was sent by Prefectural Magistrate.

836
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:07,470
Should I approve his resignation

837
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:10,320
or not?

838
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:14,520
He wants to resign

839
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,840
just because of a little bit of trouble.

840
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:18,190
How can such a person

841
00:42:18,190 --> 00:42:20,280
be useful in the future?

842
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:21,840
Listen to me,

843
00:42:22,630 --> 00:42:24,280
you should reconsider

844
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:27,710
your marriage with him.

845
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:41,080
As a magistrate,

846
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:43,190
Han Muzhi came to Taiyuan

847
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:44,560
to request grain for the people.

848
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:46,430
He came twice.

849
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:48,560
But what about you, Father?

850
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:51,150
You refused to give him any grain.

851
00:42:51,430 --> 00:42:52,390
Is it really because

852
00:42:52,390 --> 00:42:53,710
the disaster in Linfen isn't severe?

853
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:54,870
Is it really because

854
00:42:54,870 --> 00:42:56,470
the relief grain hasn't arrived yet?
