[Adapted from the novel "Jin Nang" by Shui He]

00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:33,020
[Episode 18]

4
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:28,630
Let's go.

5
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:30,160
Someone, take him down.

6
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,550
I am Qi Menglin,
the Deputy Commandant of Pingyangwei.

7
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:33,960
My father is the Governor of Shanxi.

8
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:35,270
Who dares to touch me?

9
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,190
So what?

10
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,800
This is my lady's gathering.

11
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:41,000
What right do you have to disturb it?

12
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:42,750
Your lady hasn't said anything yet.

13
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,630
Who are you to speak?

14
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:46,160
A barking dog does not bite.

15
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:51,750
Mr. Qi,

16
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,160
what are you doing?

17
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:55,360
We're just here for fun.

18
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:57,190
We asked Jin Nang

19
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,630
to showcase her skills.

20
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,520
Everyone is here to enjoy.

21
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,440
We didn't mean to offend you.

22
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:04,800
Miss Liu,

23
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,550
you truly are a refined lady.

24
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:08,600
You really have good upbringing.

25
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:10,960
You haven't even married yet,

26
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:11,880
and you're already in such a hurry,

27
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:12,830
taking charge

28
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:13,910
at Magistrate Han's place.

29
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:15,030
Your father didn't teach you

30
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:15,800
about propriety and honor?

31
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,360
Do you not know
what it means to be educated and polite?

32
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:19,190
It's okay if you don't understand.

33
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,240
Just go home and learn.

34
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,360
You reckless fool.

35
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:26,030
I'm the fool?

36
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,190
You're a shrew.

37
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:32,080
Look at all of you.

38
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,390
You flatter the powerful
and kick the downed.

39
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:34,630
You're all so petty and spiteful.

40
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:37,030
You think by flattering someone,

41
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:39,030
you'll rise to greatness?

42
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,750
You think your worth will double?

43
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,960
You're all dressed up,

44
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,190
but have no insight at all.

45
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:45,800
You actually came to the yamen

46
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:48,630
to listen to a constable play music?

47
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:49,600
What a joke!

48
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:50,750
Isn't that laughable?

49
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:54,910
Those from Mingke House
are nothing but lowly.

50
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:57,440
All they can do is play music and sing.

51
00:03:57,550 --> 00:03:58,960
They just seduce men.

52
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:01,240
We're already giving her
too much credit.

53
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,830
The lotus
grows out of the mud unstained.

54
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,720
You're all just vulgar and showy people.

55
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,270
You'd be lucky
to end up in Mingke House.

56
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:09,720
You wouldn't even get

57
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:10,440
to play music or sing there.

58
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,110
Wild quails in the ditch

59
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:15,550
have no right
to laugh at the wild geese above.

60
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:21,720
If you want to play,

61
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:22,920
play for me.

62
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:24,950
No need to waste your talents.

63
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:26,950
They won't understand.

64
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:28,390
Let's go.

65
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:37,760
Aren't you the self-proclaimed

66
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:39,160
virtuous gentleman?

67
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:41,550
A virtuous gentleman wouldn't

68
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:42,550
boast so recklessly.

69
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:44,600
Don't make promises you can't keep.

70
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,230
Don't mess with those

71
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,200
you can't protect.

72
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:00,230
You want to be his concubine?

73
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:03,000
If you're not going to be his concubine,

74
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,200
why did you degrade yourself?

75
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:06,760
Facing Liu Wan, you swallowed your pride

76
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:07,920
and did whatever she said.

77
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:09,440
You were acting like

78
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:10,350
a lowly concubine

79
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:11,550
serving the main wife.

80
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:12,510
The Luo Shu I know

81
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:13,510
would never act like this.

82
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,270
Am I now

83
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:23,480
just a big joke?

84
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:29,830
Han Muzhi is a joke.

85
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,110
He couldn't even speak

86
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,440
in front of Mr. Liu's daughter.

87
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:36,070
He has no backbone at all.

88
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:39,390
If you're angry,

89
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:41,040
I can beat him up for you.

90
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:42,640
Don't blame him.

91
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,720
It's my own fault
for not seeing clearly.

92
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:48,760
If I had supported him earlier,

93
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:50,670
he wouldn't be

94
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:52,110
so conflicted and pained.

95
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,270
He's blind to what he has.

96
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:57,390
He doesn't know how to cherish you.

97
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:58,670
He will regret it for a lifetime.

98
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:01,670
For two lifetimes, three lifetimes.

99
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,000
In short,

100
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,320
anyone who doesn't cherish you

101
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:05,480
will always regret it.

102
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:24,110
Maintain order.

103
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:27,950
Who are you?

104
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:29,270
Why did you beat the drum?

105
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:31,950
Your Honor, my name is Lv Cong.

106
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:34,110
I am the son
of Lv Wanchang from this county.

107
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:36,110
My father was imprisoned

108
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:37,390
due to the case of Ma Tianjin's murder.

109
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:39,440
I'm here to seek justice for him.

110
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:48,160
I remember this case.

111
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,480
Ma Tianjin

112
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,270
was killed by a knife at night.

113
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:53,440
At that time, someone testified

114
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:55,510
that your father
had a longstanding grudge with him.

115
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,320
Thus, he was accused of murder.

116
00:06:57,670 --> 00:06:58,880
Lv Wanchang

117
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,790
has already confessed.

118
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:03,440
My father had
deep-seated grievances with Ma Tianjin.

119
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:04,600
The whole neighborhood knows.

120
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,550
Ma Tianjin died unexpectedly.

121
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,320
Everyone looked at us suspiciously.

122
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:09,920
My father had no way to defend himself.

123
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:11,790
To protect his family,

124
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:12,830
he had no choice but to confess.

125
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,200
Now I have found evidence

126
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:16,790
that can prove my father's innocence.

127
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,760
If you can't present solid proof,

128
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:20,920
don't blame me for charging you

129
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,880
with disturbing the court.

130
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:24,760
I'm here today to reopen the case,

131
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,200
and I have undeniable evidence.

132
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,230
Please take a look, Your Honor.

133
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,320
This is a notice

134
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:41,270
I obtained from my relatives

135
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:42,440
at Hejin Yamen.

136
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,040
It is copied faithfully.

137
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,110
If there are any fabrications,

138
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:47,000
I will accept punishment.

139
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,350
In Hejin County last month,

140
00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:50,720
over ten bandits were captured.

141
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:52,390
Among them, two confessed

142
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,230
that they had
broken into Ma's place to rob

143
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:55,760
and killed Ma Tianjin.

144
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,550
My father is innocent.

145
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,110
I ask you, Your Honor, to see the truth.

146
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,040
Miss Luo, are you tired?

147
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,480
Take a break. I'll do it.

148
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,160
No, thanks.

149
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:29,920
Miss Luo,

150
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,670
this work never ends.

151
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:33,280
When you're feeling down,

152
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,670
you need to take care of yourself.

153
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,470
I know.

154
00:08:36,910 --> 00:08:38,230
You always know better.

155
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:41,000
Miss Luo, just hold on a few more days.

156
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,350
Once Miss Liu leaves,

157
00:08:42,350 --> 00:08:43,320
things will settle down.

158
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:49,790
How could

159
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:50,960
such a thing happen?

160
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:53,230
And it involves Hejin County.

161
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:54,640
I'm also baffled.

162
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:56,200
When the case was tried that day,

163
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:57,280
the facts were clear.

164
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,520
Lv Wanchang confessed.

165
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:00,230
I believe

166
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:01,400
the ruling made that day

167
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,320
was appropriate.

168
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,470
It's best

169
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:05,670
to resolve this case swiftly.

170
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,080
Don't let it
escalate to the higher office.

171
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:09,910
Otherwise,

172
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:12,320
it may affect

173
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,080
your career prospects.

174
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:16,550
Yes.

175
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:20,230
Your arrival in Linfen

176
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:22,550
is just the first step in your career.

177
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:25,000
It's to build your achievements

178
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,000
to help you rise in the future.

179
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:31,710
You must distinguish between priorities.

180
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:33,350
Don't sweat the small stuff.

181
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:35,080
Those trivial matters

182
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,840
can consume a lot of energy.

183
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:38,670
If real problems arise,

184
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:39,840
like this case,

185
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:42,400
you'll dig yourself a hole.

186
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:44,080
You'll give others a reason
to take advantage of you.

187
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:45,550
It's a thankless job.

188
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:47,470
But matters concerning the people
are important,

189
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:49,440
and I just want to stand up for them.

190
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:53,440
This is all just talk for others.

191
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:56,470
If you even believe it yourself,

192
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,440
that's quite foolish.

193
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:02,790
You've been in Linfen

194
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:04,960
for over a year now.

195
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,670
Look at the cases you've handled.

196
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:10,760
Half of them are related to lust.

197
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,710
Does that sound good to you?

198
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:16,550
I also heard

199
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:21,110
that you paid to relocate
the graves of the victims

200
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:24,000
so the couple could be buried together.

201
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:25,910
That's because
this person helped the yamen

202
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:27,200
clear out the mining gang's minions.

203
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:27,910
He deserved credit.

204
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:29,200
No matter what the reason,

205
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:31,230
that's not something a magistrate

206
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:32,670
should have done.

207
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:34,710
I heard that yesterday

208
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:37,000
that reckless Mr. Qi

209
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:39,080
caused a scene at Wan's gathering

210
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,280
because of a courtesan.

211
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:42,590
Is this true?

212
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:44,030
Yes, it is.

213
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:48,880
As the magistrate of Linfen,

214
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:51,550
arguing with someone in public

215
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:53,520
is indeed not advisable.

216
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,640
However, your inaction

217
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,280
has truly

218
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:01,200
caused Wan some grievances.

219
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:04,880
You and Wan are not formally married,

220
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:06,080
but in name,

221
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:08,280
she is already your wife.

222
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:12,000
As her father,

223
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:15,080
I do not wish for my daughter

224
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,840
to suffer any more grievances.

225
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:28,080
Muzhi,

226
00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:30,790
I have always regarded you

227
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:32,670
favorably.

228
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,440
I have even considered

229
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:37,440
betrothing my daughter to you.

230
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:42,470
Do not let me down.

231
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:44,880
Yes.

232
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:53,520
Muzhi.

233
00:11:57,910 --> 00:11:59,790
What did Mr. Liu say?

234
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,550
He said everything.

235
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:05,110
He pointed out all my actions

236
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:06,000
and details of the case

237
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,710
in the yamen.

238
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:10,280
He was thorough.

239
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,350
If it weren't for my men

240
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:13,320
acting as informants,

241
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:15,230
how could he know so much?

242
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:18,440
That's not surprising.

243
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:20,110
It's always the case

244
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,640
that the magistrates come and go
while the petty officials remain.

245
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:24,710
A magistrate leaves when his term ends,

246
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:26,350
but these petty officials in the yamen

247
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:27,910
have often been there for decades,

248
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,760
even passed down through generations.

249
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,110
Naturally, they form their own factions

250
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,320
and have

251
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,520
their own
considerations and calculations.

252
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:36,470
I cannot

253
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:38,280
live under constant surveillance.

254
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:41,150
Meiqing,

255
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:44,550
I want to rectify the situation.

256
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:46,520
No, Muzhi.

257
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:50,030
Do not act rashly.

258
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,640
Otherwise, if it fails,

259
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:53,350
you might suffer for it.

260
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:58,910
Alright.

261
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:01,520
This matter

262
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:02,760
can be discussed later.

263
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:05,320
Right now, the most important thing

264
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:07,280
is to thoroughly investigate
the murder of Ma Tianjin

265
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:09,230
and the case
of Lv Wanchang's son seeking justice.

266
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:10,960
Indeed.

267
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,670
If this case is not resolved,

268
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:13,670
it will be a stain

269
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:14,760
on your tenure in Linfen.

270
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:19,230
The evidence from Lv Cong's recantation

271
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:20,470
comes from Hejin County.

272
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,350
You must send someone immediately

273
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:25,030
with my name card and travel permit

274
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:26,280
to Hejin.

275
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:28,670
Understood.

276
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,110
Welcome back, Cai.

277
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:32,320
Baozi!

278
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:34,230
Make some pancakes
for me this afternoon.

279
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,030
Tomorrow morning.

280
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:36,150
I'm going to Hejin.

281
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:37,590
I'll need food for the road.

282
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:40,030
Is it about the Ma Tianjin case?

283
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:40,880
Yes.

284
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:42,710
Now Lv Wanchang's son

285
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:44,080
is trying to clear his father's name.

286
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,280
If we don't solve it,

287
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:47,030
it might escalate to the higher office.

288
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:48,590
The magistrate could be branded

289
00:13:48,590 --> 00:13:49,790
with a name of wrongful judgment.

290
00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:51,150
That would be serious.

291
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,350
When I reviewed the case files,

292
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:56,910
I questioned Lv Wanchang in prison.

293
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,200
He was evasive,

294
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,350
agitated and restless.

295
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:00,960
When he admitted to the murder,

296
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,150
his eyes flashed with malice,

297
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:03,350
seeming like a killer.

298
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,030
Lv Wanchang

299
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:07,200
is a well-known wealthy man in Linfen,

300
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,350
arrogant and overbearing.

301
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:10,200
He isn't really a bully,

302
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,150
but he is definitely not

303
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:11,840
someone easy to deal with.

304
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:13,910
So, who is richer,

305
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:15,150
him or Ma Tianjin?

306
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,440
Of course, it's him.

307
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:17,760
Their houses are next to each other.

308
00:14:18,110 --> 00:14:18,910
The Lv family's mansion

309
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:20,110
is clearly much grander.

310
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:22,350
Given this,

311
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:25,320
if bandits were passing by to steal,

312
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,550
why would they choose the Ma family

313
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:27,760
instead of the Lv family?

314
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:29,840
Could it be that these bandits

315
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:31,710
know that Lv Wanchang
is not to be trifled with

316
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:34,150
and would prefer
to take the safer option?

317
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:35,960
How could a murderer

318
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:37,550
fear a domineering gentleman?

319
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:38,880
So,

320
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,440
it doesn't make sense

321
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,710
that the bandits killed Ma Tianjin.

322
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:45,590
But what about that notice

323
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:47,110
from Hejin?

324
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:49,550
Mr. Cai,

325
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,230
I will go with you.

326
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:52,320
This case is complicated.

327
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:53,400
I can help out

328
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:54,710
and provide some ideas.

329
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:56,150
That would be great!

330
00:14:56,150 --> 00:14:56,760
With you

331
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:58,230
and my junior from Hejin assisting,

332
00:14:58,230 --> 00:14:59,840
I feel much more confident.

333
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:03,710
But I wonder if the magistrate

334
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,230
will allow you to go.

335
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:08,280
You want to follow Captain Cai

336
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:09,470
to Hejin to investigate?

337
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:11,320
I have nothing to do in the yamen.

338
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:12,520
If I go to investigate,

339
00:15:12,590 --> 00:15:14,080
I might be of some help.

340
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:17,640
At this time, you...

341
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:20,280
Alright.

342
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,320
You can avoid some people

343
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,880
by going out for a few days.

344
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:23,880
Go ahead.

345
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,150
I will talk to Muzhi.

346
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:26,880
Thank you, Mr. Chen.

347
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,000
Luo Shu.

348
00:15:40,590 --> 00:15:41,320
Are you there?

349
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:43,590
It's me.

350
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:52,230
What are you doing?

351
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:55,710
I'm going to Hejin to investigate.

352
00:15:58,350 --> 00:15:59,080
Investigate?

353
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,230
I thought you...

354
00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:03,110
Come in.

355
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,440
My removal papers are still pending.

356
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:10,790
Recently,

357
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:12,230
I have nothing to do here anyway.

358
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:16,230
Han Muzhi really

359
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:17,440
is all talk.

360
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:20,230
He keeps delaying what he promised you.

361
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:22,110
He submitted it ages ago.

362
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:23,470
It should be coming soon.

363
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:25,230
If it was submitted long ago,

364
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:26,320
it should have been resolved by now.

365
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:27,590
If it's still pending,

366
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:29,030
there must be someone stalling it.

367
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:33,200
How about this?

368
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:34,550
I'll write a letter to my father

369
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:35,590
and ask him to look into this.

370
00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:36,710
He should be able to help you.

371
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,320
This trivial matter

372
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,880
should not trouble the governor.

373
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:41,840
The governor
is in charge of military affairs,

374
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,470
and such civil matters
are not his concern.

375
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,230
But he can still have some influence.

376
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Though my father doesn't think much

377
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,320
of the ruling Mr. Liu.

378
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:51,910
Thank you for your kindness.

379
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:53,320
But I believe

380
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,440
it will be resolved soon.

381
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,550
Did you come for something?

382
00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:00,150
I...

383
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:02,080
I'm going with you to investigate.

384
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,230
When are you leaving tomorrow?

385
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:05,640
At Chen hour.

386
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:07,710
You agree?

387
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,350
Does it matter if I disagree?

388
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:12,520
Anyway,

389
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:14,310
you...

390
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:15,590
wherever you go, I'll be with you.

391
00:17:15,590 --> 00:17:16,310
I'm leaving.

392
00:17:17,830 --> 00:17:18,830
I'll be with you.

393
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,280
I will definitely be with you.

394
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:21,400
I'll keep my promise.

395
00:17:57,830 --> 00:17:58,760
Your Honor,

396
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:00,710
is there something?

397
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:10,070
Be careful
while handling the case in Hejin.

398
00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:14,710
Alright.

399
00:19:18,470 --> 00:19:19,350
You promised me yesterday

400
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:20,710
and agreed so readily.

401
00:19:20,710 --> 00:19:22,310
I knew it was a trap.

402
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:25,950
This is too much.

403
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:35,470
Young Master!

404
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:37,280
Young Master, wait for me, Young Master!

405
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,000
Young Master!

406
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,760
Young Master, wait for me, Young Master!

407
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:40,710
Go back!

408
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,710
I have Luo Shu
taking care of me these days.

409
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:43,640
Don't worry.

410
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:44,470
Just go back.

411
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:45,760
Young Master,

412
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:46,640
I've put the money

413
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,190
in the pocket of the felt bag.

414
00:19:48,190 --> 00:19:49,230
Spend it wisely.

415
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:50,920
I know. Go back.

416
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:52,950
Young Master, you must be careful.

417
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:53,880
Just go back.

418
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:37,520
The Fen River at this time

419
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:38,710
has a beautiful scenery.

420
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,470
But compared to real famous mountains

421
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:41,110
and rivers,

422
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:42,430
it's not the same.

423
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:44,760
Mr. Qi, you sound

424
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:46,590
like someone who has roamed the world

425
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:47,800
and seen all the landscapes.

426
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:54,160
If you've seen

427
00:20:55,310 --> 00:20:57,680
the spring tide connecting to the sea,

428
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,950
the bright moon rising with the tide,

429
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:03,430
or the autumn wind brushing Weihe River,

430
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:05,160
leaves falling all over Chang'an,

431
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:08,590
or the lonely smoke
rising over the vast desert,

432
00:21:08,590 --> 00:21:10,110
the sun setting over the long river,

433
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:13,230
you'll know I'm not exaggerating.

434
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,710
Linfen

435
00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:16,760
is not worth lingering over.

436
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:20,190
The poem you recited casually...

437
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,430
I've memorized for several days.

438
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:25,000
It's not appropriate?

439
00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:26,400
Yes.

440
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:29,470
It's just a bit unusual for you.

441
00:21:31,430 --> 00:21:32,280
Then in your eyes,

442
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:33,160
what kind of person am I?

443
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:35,430
You...

444
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:39,520
Before and now...

445
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,400
You're quite different now.

446
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:44,560
That's all?

447
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:45,680
Yes.

448
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:52,190
Luo Shu is praising you.

449
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,040
Praising me?

450
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:12,110
Yesterday you didn't get any money,

451
00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:12,830
so the master

452
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:13,640
rewarded me

453
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:14,520
with a basket of meat buns,

454
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:16,000
and you aren't allowed to eat.
How dare you.

455
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:16,880
Brother,

456
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,680
you have a whole basket.

457
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:20,160
At least share one with me.

458
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:21,800
I've been hungry all night.

459
00:22:22,190 --> 00:22:23,000
No way.

460
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,350
What am I supposed to eat today?

461
00:22:27,950 --> 00:22:29,000
The same as yesterday:

462
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,110
pancakes and dried meat.

463
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:38,560
Just bear with it a little longer.

464
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:40,520
When we get to the county town,
we can eat out.

465
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:42,400
Can we trade this dried meat

466
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,760
for buns with them?

467
00:22:46,190 --> 00:22:47,400
The beggars made the buns

468
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:48,310
with their dirty hands.

469
00:22:48,430 --> 00:22:49,830
You'll have diarrhea.

470
00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:53,000
Can I trade dried meat

471
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,190
for buns with you?

472
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:57,000
Sure.

473
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:57,880
Alright.

474
00:23:01,230 --> 00:23:01,880
Here.

475
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:02,880
Here you are.

476
00:23:09,310 --> 00:23:10,190
Really delicious!

477
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:11,230
Where did you get

478
00:23:11,230 --> 00:23:12,070
so many buns?

479
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:13,160
These are from our master.

480
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:14,350
He ferried a woman across the river

481
00:23:14,350 --> 00:23:15,350
and got this as a reward.

482
00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:16,430
They're really tasty.

483
00:23:16,590 --> 00:23:17,800
Yes, they are.

484
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:20,160
Do you usually stay around here?

485
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:20,830
Not really.

486
00:23:20,950 --> 00:23:22,350
We came to meet our master.

487
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:25,950
You have liquor here?

488
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:26,950
Sell me some.

489
00:23:26,950 --> 00:23:27,830
No way.

490
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:28,280
We can't sell it.

491
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:29,310
What's wrong with just one jug?

492
00:23:29,310 --> 00:23:30,280
No way, absolutely not.

493
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:30,830
Definitely not selling.

494
00:23:30,830 --> 00:23:31,920
I'll give you money.

495
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,520
No way, absolutely not selling.

496
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:34,640
You're so stingy. Here you are.

497
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:35,830
You've had buns,

498
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:37,590
so why do you stay on our boat?

499
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:39,400
Get off.

500
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:40,710
Get off.

501
00:23:44,310 --> 00:23:45,230
Alright.

502
00:23:55,110 --> 00:23:56,640
Mr. Qi, jump off the boat!

503
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:04,350
Run!

504
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:16,310
Are you alright?

505
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:21,430
Luo Shu,

506
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:23,280
if you were a man,

507
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:24,590
I would definitely
sworn brotherhood with you.

508
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,430
Too bad you're a girl.

509
00:24:26,710 --> 00:24:27,190
I...

510
00:24:27,190 --> 00:24:27,680
You look

511
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:28,920
almost like a young lady.

512
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:31,430
You two can become

513
00:24:31,950 --> 00:24:33,040
sworn sisters then.

514
00:24:38,350 --> 00:24:39,160
What did you see

515
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:40,190
in the vat just now?

516
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:42,430
A head.

517
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:43,560
What?

518
00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:46,280
The buns I just ate

519
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:47,680
can't be made from human meat, right?

520
00:24:52,590 --> 00:24:53,350
Those two little beggars

521
00:24:53,350 --> 00:24:54,520
were eating them happily.

522
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:55,800
So they can't be human meat.

523
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,920
The body in that vat

524
00:24:58,230 --> 00:24:58,950
might

525
00:24:58,950 --> 00:25:00,040
belong to the owner of the buns.

526
00:25:04,710 --> 00:25:05,920
Those little brats

527
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:07,520
made me eat buns made from human meat.

528
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:08,640
If I get my hands on them,

529
00:25:08,830 --> 00:25:10,190
I'll skin them alive.

530
00:25:10,190 --> 00:25:10,710
When they said

531
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:11,590
that stuff earlier,

532
00:25:11,590 --> 00:25:12,760
I thought it was weird.

533
00:25:13,430 --> 00:25:14,310
Anyone

534
00:25:14,310 --> 00:25:14,950
willing to take a beggar's boat

535
00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:16,230
cross the river must not be well-off.

536
00:25:16,310 --> 00:25:17,400
Who would give away

537
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:18,640
a basket of meat buns?

538
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:20,800
They must have killed her
to take her riches.

539
00:25:21,590 --> 00:25:22,830
If we chase them now,

540
00:25:23,310 --> 00:25:24,310
we might still catch up.

541
00:25:24,430 --> 00:25:25,350
Let's grab them

542
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,920
and send them to Hejin Yamen.

543
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,160
This isn't Linfen.

544
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29,470
We'd better to stay out of trouble.

545
00:25:30,470 --> 00:25:31,070
What

546
00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:32,590
do you mean?

547
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:33,880
As a yamen officer,

548
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:35,520
when criminals slip by,

549
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:36,830
we can't ignore it.

550
00:25:39,310 --> 00:25:40,680
Those two little beggars said

551
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:42,230
they were here to fetch their teacher.

552
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:43,680
They're afraid of being punished

553
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,800
and might come back.

554
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:47,710
You hurry to the boat

555
00:25:47,710 --> 00:25:48,710
to get the luggage,

556
00:25:48,710 --> 00:25:49,950
and change your clothes
so you won't catch a cold.

557
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:52,830
Mr. Li,

558
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,560
you quickly go to Hejin Yamen for help.

559
00:25:54,710 --> 00:25:55,920
We'll wait here for them.

560
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:56,830
Okay.

561
00:26:24,470 --> 00:26:25,470
I'll pretend to cross the river

562
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:26,680
to hold those beggars up.

563
00:26:26,830 --> 00:26:27,830
No need to make it so complicated.

564
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:28,710
We can just rush up,

565
00:26:28,710 --> 00:26:29,590
and grab

566
00:26:29,590 --> 00:26:30,430
those three bad men.

567
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:31,400
That won't work.

568
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:32,760
We're not familiar with this palce,

569
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:33,760
so we can't be sure
of capturing them.

570
00:26:34,230 --> 00:26:34,680
But,

571
00:26:34,710 --> 00:26:36,230
we can't let you take the risk.

572
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,520
Didn't you say

573
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:39,310
as a yamen officer,

574
00:26:39,310 --> 00:26:40,430
when criminals slip by,

575
00:26:40,430 --> 00:26:41,830
we can't ignore it?

576
00:26:41,950 --> 00:26:42,680
Why are you trying

577
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:43,760
to stop me now?

578
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
There are plenty of ways.

579
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:46,560
I can go over

580
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:47,350
and block them.

581
00:26:47,350 --> 00:26:49,070
You're the one
who shouldn't show yourself.

582
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:50,070
As long as you stay hidden,

583
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:50,950
I'll be safe.

584
00:26:51,230 --> 00:26:52,040
Don't worry.

585
00:26:52,230 --> 00:26:53,400
Since we can handle cases

586
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,520
as dangerous as the mine,

587
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:55,470
we'll be fine this time.

588
00:26:55,470 --> 00:26:56,070
Promise me, next time...

589
00:26:56,070 --> 00:26:56,950
Look, they're coming.

590
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:03,710
Teacher!

591
00:27:14,230 --> 00:27:15,190
Be careful!

592
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:16,280
Boatman!

593
00:27:17,830 --> 00:27:18,560
Boatman!

594
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:20,920
Wait a moment, boatman.

595
00:27:21,070 --> 00:27:22,520
Could you please
take me across the river?

596
00:27:24,950 --> 00:27:26,040
Boatman,

597
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:27,350
how much for a ride

598
00:27:27,430 --> 00:27:29,190
across the river?

599
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:32,350
You want to cross the river?

600
00:27:32,470 --> 00:27:33,640
Then hop on.

601
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,040
It's just a small favor.

602
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:36,400
No charge.

603
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:38,640
How can I accept a free ride?

604
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,070
Please take some money.

605
00:27:41,950 --> 00:27:43,470
Teacher, we should hurry.

606
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:45,310
That liquor vat got smashed by someone.

607
00:27:45,310 --> 00:27:46,470
Fortunately, we ran fast.

608
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:52,190
I have urgent business.

609
00:27:52,230 --> 00:27:54,280
If you're not getting on the boat,

610
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:55,880
you can wait for another ride.

611
00:27:58,070 --> 00:28:00,400
Wait! I need to cross the river quickly.

612
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:01,430
Please help me!

613
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:03,880
What are you waiting for?

614
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:04,520
Hurry up and stop them!

615
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:05,760
She didn't say
she would get on their boat.

616
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:08,640
Stop right there!

617
00:28:09,350 --> 00:28:09,950
Stop!

618
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:12,000
Who are you?

619
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:13,920
How dare you abduct my wife!

620
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:15,560
Please, help me!

621
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:16,350
He's not my husband.

622
00:28:16,350 --> 00:28:17,520
I don't even know him!

623
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:18,190
That's nonsense!

624
00:28:18,190 --> 00:28:19,400
I paid 30 liang

625
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:20,110
for her!

626
00:28:22,590 --> 00:28:23,950
Are you all in on this scam

627
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,640
tricking me into marriage
and extorting my money?

628
00:28:26,710 --> 00:28:27,710
Listen up!

629
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:29,400
I'm a constable from the yamen.

630
00:28:29,430 --> 00:28:30,110
If you know what's good for you,

631
00:28:30,110 --> 00:28:31,350
hand her over quickly,

632
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:32,280
or I'll take you all

633
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:33,470
to jail!

634
00:28:33,830 --> 00:28:35,070
He's not a constable at all.

635
00:28:35,070 --> 00:28:36,230
He's just a kidnapper!

636
00:28:36,230 --> 00:28:37,920
He uses that uniform to trick women.

637
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:39,430
I barely escaped from him!

638
00:28:39,470 --> 00:28:40,160
Paddle the boat over here.

639
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:41,190
Hurry and give her to me!

640
00:28:41,230 --> 00:28:42,160
Hurry up! Row the boat!

641
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,000
Hand her over!

642
00:28:43,070 --> 00:28:44,000
Please!

643
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,230
Let's go! It's a trap!

644
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:05,310
Are you okay?

645
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:05,950
I'm fine.

646
00:29:06,950 --> 00:29:07,830
They're trying to run!

647
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:10,710
They won't get away. Look!

648
00:29:14,190 --> 00:29:15,000
Mr. Qi.

649
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:23,590
Hurry up!

650
00:29:23,590 --> 00:29:24,470
Good job, Mr. Qi!

651
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:26,640
Are you three okay?

652
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:27,470
We're fine.

653
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:30,520
Zhan.

654
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:31,430
Dabing!

655
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,280
Not bad!

656
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:37,160
Miss Luo, Mr. Qi,

657
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:37,680
this is

658
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:38,760
my junior Yang Zhan,

659
00:29:38,950 --> 00:29:40,070
the one I've been telling you about

660
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:41,280
and practiced martial arts with.

661
00:29:42,350 --> 00:29:43,830
Mr. Yang, nice to meet you.

662
00:29:43,830 --> 00:29:44,590
Mr. Yang.

663
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:45,800
Zhan.

664
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
This is Deputy Commandant of Pingyangwei

665
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,190
Qi Menglin.

666
00:29:49,190 --> 00:29:50,350
And this is Luo Shu,

667
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:51,680
another constable from our yamen.

668
00:29:52,950 --> 00:29:53,760
Deputy Commandant Qi.

669
00:29:56,350 --> 00:29:58,950
You have a female constable?

670
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:00,830
What's wrong with that?

671
00:30:01,310 --> 00:30:02,520
Miss Luo

672
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:03,430
is quite impressive.

673
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:04,800
Mr. Yang,

674
00:30:05,230 --> 00:30:06,880
why is everyone so happy?

675
00:30:07,310 --> 00:30:08,760
We're sorry

676
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:10,040
for making you come all this way.

677
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:11,400
Our magistrate

678
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:12,470
loves to solve bizarre cases.

679
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,760
He says it's impressive
to write it in the records,

680
00:30:15,070 --> 00:30:16,110
it attracts attention from above,

681
00:30:16,110 --> 00:30:17,430
and it helps with promotion.

682
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:19,160
Like the beggars killing someone

683
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:20,160
and hiding the body in a vat,

684
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,190
what a sensational story!

685
00:30:21,190 --> 00:30:22,710
He must be thrilled.

686
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:24,070
When he's happy,

687
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:25,710
he'll reward us.

688
00:30:27,430 --> 00:30:28,680
We came here

689
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:29,800
to investigate a case.

690
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:31,070
Right!

691
00:30:32,310 --> 00:30:33,000
Here!

692
00:30:35,230 --> 00:30:36,040
We want to see

693
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:36,880
the two criminals

694
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:37,920
who killed Ma Tianjin.

695
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:40,070
Okay.

696
00:30:40,310 --> 00:30:41,280
I'll take you

697
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:42,070
to the county jail.

698
00:30:42,070 --> 00:30:42,800
Thanks!

699
00:30:43,190 --> 00:30:43,880
Let's go.

700
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:48,280
[Jail]

701
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:49,830
Go inside.

702
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:52,230
Go in there!

703
00:30:52,430 --> 00:30:53,710
Keep an eye on them.

704
00:30:56,470 --> 00:30:56,800
Song.

705
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:58,710
Mr. Yang, what's going on here?

706
00:30:59,710 --> 00:31:00,430
They

707
00:31:00,430 --> 00:31:02,190
are from the Linfen Yamen.

708
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,190
They want to interrogate

709
00:31:03,190 --> 00:31:04,640
the criminals who killed Ma Tianjin.

710
00:31:05,470 --> 00:31:06,590
So this big case

711
00:31:06,590 --> 00:31:09,230
was discovered by them?

712
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:11,880
I'll handle this.

713
00:31:12,230 --> 00:31:13,430
I'll take them inside.

714
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:14,710
Usually,

715
00:31:14,710 --> 00:31:16,470
you're always slacking off.

716
00:31:16,710 --> 00:31:18,070
Why are you so diligent today?

717
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,430
Thanks to them,

718
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:22,160
we all got rewards.

719
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:23,680
Of course, I should work hard

720
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:25,190
to show my gratitude.

721
00:31:25,310 --> 00:31:26,640
You're quite perceptive.

722
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:28,000
Alright, hurry up.

723
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,640
This way, please.

724
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:47,590
You two, go squat

725
00:31:47,590 --> 00:31:48,350
over there.

726
00:31:49,350 --> 00:31:50,520
Quick, squat down!

727
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,680
We're from the Linfen Yamen.

728
00:31:59,950 --> 00:32:01,560
We're here for the Ma Tianjin case.

729
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:03,310
You pretty boy.

730
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:04,310
Mind your manners!

731
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:07,590
You two better behave

732
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:08,760
and answer honestly.

733
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:13,190
Did you two kill Ma Tianjin

734
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:15,310
from Linfen?

735
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:16,560
Yeah, we did.

736
00:32:16,830 --> 00:32:18,520
If not, don't claim it.

737
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:20,520
Don't let the dead die wrongfully.

738
00:32:20,710 --> 00:32:21,640
What a joke!

739
00:32:22,470 --> 00:32:23,830
We've killed so many people.

740
00:32:24,430 --> 00:32:26,160
We don't need
to take the blame for another murder?

741
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,190
I looked through the files.

742
00:32:30,230 --> 00:32:31,190
You confessed

743
00:32:31,190 --> 00:32:33,880
that killing Ma Tianjin
was a spur-of-the-moment thing.

744
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:36,310
In that case,

745
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:37,880
how come you remember his name

746
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,230
so clearly?

747
00:32:41,430 --> 00:32:42,760
His family is from Linfen,

748
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:44,000
a well-known wealthy family.

749
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:45,680
Who doesn't know his name?

750
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:47,040
Do you know

751
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:48,470
his neighbor, Lv Wanchang

752
00:32:48,470 --> 00:32:49,520
is even richer?

753
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:50,640
Yeah, we know.

754
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:51,590
So why not rob

755
00:32:51,590 --> 00:32:52,800
the richer Lv family?

756
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,160
Lv Wanchang

757
00:32:54,190 --> 00:32:56,760
usually enjoys practicing with weapons,

758
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:58,640
and he has plenty of guards at home.

759
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,160
We were afraid we couldn't handle him.

760
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:01,310
Okay.

761
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:02,710
Since you two

762
00:33:02,710 --> 00:33:04,430
killed for money,

763
00:33:04,950 --> 00:33:07,310
tell us how you did it.

764
00:33:09,310 --> 00:33:10,830
We climbed over the wall

765
00:33:11,230 --> 00:33:13,040
and sneaked into the hall.

766
00:33:13,710 --> 00:33:15,950
In the hall, there's a set

767
00:33:15,950 --> 00:33:17,230
of elm table and chairs,

768
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:19,110
and some rosewood flower stands,

769
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,280
next to which there is

770
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:23,190
a wall table inlaid with marble,

771
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:26,040
with a bronze candlestick on it.

772
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:27,160
Stop wasting time with them.

773
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:30,230
Behave and squat down!

774
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:31,470
Squat down!

775
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,070
Anyway, we've told you

776
00:33:34,070 --> 00:33:35,350
everything we need to.

777
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:37,230
Kill or torture us,

778
00:33:38,110 --> 00:33:38,920
it's up to you.

779
00:33:43,230 --> 00:33:44,400
Don't get angry, everyone.

780
00:33:45,310 --> 00:33:46,950
These two murderers

781
00:33:46,950 --> 00:33:48,590
never know how to talk nicely.

782
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:49,880
Besides,

783
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:51,640
the questioning can wait.

784
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:54,560
I think it's getting late.

785
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:56,760
How about we eat first?

786
00:34:04,470 --> 00:34:05,230
It's getting late.

787
00:34:05,230 --> 00:34:07,040
You all should head back and rest.

788
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:08,870
Sorry for the poor hospitality, goodbye.

789
00:34:08,910 --> 00:34:09,710
It's okay.

790
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:10,910
Thank you.

791
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:11,870
Let's go.

792
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:16,390
I was busy drinking earlier.

793
00:34:16,710 --> 00:34:18,230
I didn't even fill my stomach.

794
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:23,000
Let's have some wheat noodles;
it's on me.

795
00:34:23,910 --> 00:34:24,710
Let's go!

796
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:26,520
Okay!

797
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:27,120
Boss,

798
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:28,840
bring us five bowls of wheat noodles.

799
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:30,120
Add more toppings!

800
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:30,870
Okay!

801
00:34:31,390 --> 00:34:32,190
I Didn't expect

802
00:34:32,190 --> 00:34:34,230
Song to be so generous.

803
00:34:34,630 --> 00:34:37,120
Today, he is really spending a lot.

804
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:37,840
Yeah.

805
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:39,800
I was planning to treat everyone.

806
00:34:39,870 --> 00:34:41,190
I didn't expect Song

807
00:34:41,190 --> 00:34:42,840
to know the waiter here

808
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:44,080
and that he would pay the bill first.

809
00:34:44,230 --> 00:34:45,150
He really is generous.

810
00:34:45,150 --> 00:34:46,040
This meal should be

811
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:47,760
my way of being a good host.

812
00:34:48,190 --> 00:34:49,150
Here they are!

813
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:52,190
Here they are!

814
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:53,950
Song must be a regular at the tavern.

815
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:56,760
He often treats people to drinks.

816
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:58,280
That's why he's well-liked

817
00:34:58,280 --> 00:34:59,630
in the yamen.

818
00:34:59,670 --> 00:35:02,040
But he's just a jailer.

819
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:03,150
Where does he get the money?

820
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:06,800
He and many others in the yamen

821
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,560
don't live off their salaries.

822
00:35:08,910 --> 00:35:09,800
The truth is,

823
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:10,760
as long as you can get over

824
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:12,040
that moral hurdle,

825
00:35:12,470 --> 00:35:13,360
you have plenty

826
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:14,390
of ways to make money.

827
00:35:15,470 --> 00:35:16,320
What kind of ways?

828
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:18,560
Get paid to do favors
or to settle issues.

829
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,120
Isn't that corruption?

830
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:21,320
But they don't care

831
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:22,360
about right or wrong.

832
00:35:22,430 --> 00:35:24,710
With money, they can get things done.

833
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:26,870
Money can make anything happen.

834
00:35:26,870 --> 00:35:27,760
I believe that.

835
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:29,190
It's ridiculous.

836
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:31,150
Actually, in our Linfen Yamen,

837
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:32,760
there are quite a few people like that.

838
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:33,040
It's just that

839
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:34,560
our new Magistrate Han

840
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:35,600
is honest and upright.

841
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:37,080
So they've toned it down a bit.

842
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:38,910
Zhan,

843
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:40,670
the most important thing in life

844
00:35:40,670 --> 00:35:41,360
is to stick to our principles.

845
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:42,190
Do you remember how our master

846
00:35:42,190 --> 00:35:43,280
taught us?

847
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:44,840
I remember, don't worry.

848
00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:46,390
We have to be true to our conscience.

849
00:35:46,870 --> 00:35:47,670
Right.

850
00:35:47,710 --> 00:35:49,040
We can't go along with the corruption.

851
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:52,360
Eat up, Miss Luo.

852
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:55,360
Jin Liu

853
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:56,950
and Zheng San's answers

854
00:35:57,430 --> 00:35:58,430
have no loopholes.

855
00:35:59,430 --> 00:36:01,320
Their account of events
is very complete.

856
00:36:01,630 --> 00:36:02,950
This case is tricky.

857
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:05,670
No loopholes means there's a loophole.

858
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:07,910
Exactly.

859
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:09,670
They're so quick with their responses;

860
00:36:09,670 --> 00:36:10,630
they must be well-prepared.

861
00:36:11,870 --> 00:36:12,670
So let's

862
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:14,040
disrupt their routine.

863
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:15,230
Let's ask again.

864
00:36:16,430 --> 00:36:17,630
We need to think carefully

865
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:19,190
about how to question them this time.

866
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:25,670
They're in there.

867
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,000
Thanks, Mr. Yang.

868
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:29,840
It's my duty.

869
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:32,080
No need to be polite with him.

870
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:36,950
Where's Song?

871
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,390
He isn't on duty today.

872
00:36:39,470 --> 00:36:41,360
He's probably at home
drinking and having fun.

873
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:43,470
Get them the key.

874
00:36:44,390 --> 00:36:45,840
Alright, you can interrogate.

875
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:47,190
Okay, you can go take care
of your business.

876
00:36:47,190 --> 00:36:47,560
Okay.

877
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:48,230
Okay?

878
00:36:48,430 --> 00:36:49,190
Take them inside.

879
00:36:49,190 --> 00:36:49,800
Okay!

880
00:36:50,390 --> 00:36:51,080
Let's go.

881
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:03,520
We've said what needs to be said.

882
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:05,120
What do you want now?

883
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:05,870
I know

884
00:37:05,870 --> 00:37:07,520
you didn't kill Ma Tianjin.

885
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:10,190
You're taking the fall for someone else.

886
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:14,600
So tell me,

887
00:37:15,870 --> 00:37:17,040
how much did you get paid?

888
00:37:17,150 --> 00:37:18,040
You're talking nonsense.

889
00:37:18,150 --> 00:37:19,430
We killed Ma Tianjin!

890
00:37:19,870 --> 00:37:21,000
I didn't expect

891
00:37:21,710 --> 00:37:24,190
that you two bandits are quite cultured.

892
00:37:25,230 --> 00:37:26,670
In your last confession,

893
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:28,600
you knew all

894
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:29,840
about the fine collectibles

895
00:37:29,870 --> 00:37:31,430
in Ma Tianjin's house.

896
00:37:32,630 --> 00:37:34,430
We're used to robbing places.

897
00:37:34,470 --> 00:37:35,520
Of course we recognize

898
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:36,430
valuable items.

899
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:39,760
But do you know

900
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:41,670
the difference
between beech and rosewood?

901
00:37:45,670 --> 00:37:46,470
No idea?

902
00:37:48,230 --> 00:37:50,360
These two types of wood
are similar in color.

903
00:37:50,470 --> 00:37:52,230
We can only tell by the grain.

904
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:55,430
If you don't know the difference,

905
00:37:55,950 --> 00:37:56,670
how could you

906
00:37:56,670 --> 00:37:58,470
tell what the table and chairs

907
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:01,040
and flower stands were made of

908
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:02,600
in the dark?

909
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:06,360
The confession says you broke in,

910
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:07,840
but the doors and windows
of the Ma family

911
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:09,800
show no signs of being broken.

912
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:11,360
How is that possible?

913
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:12,120
Uh...

914
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:15,230
I don't get it.

915
00:38:15,230 --> 00:38:15,870
Because you

916
00:38:15,870 --> 00:38:17,230
never even entered the Ma house

917
00:38:17,230 --> 00:38:18,870
and you never killed anyone.

918
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:20,950
You're just taking the fall
for someone else.

919
00:38:20,950 --> 00:38:21,630
All your confessions

920
00:38:21,630 --> 00:38:23,390
were coached by someone.

921
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:24,760
If you're willing to reveal

922
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:25,670
the mastermind,

923
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:28,150
I can report it
to the Linfen magistrate,

924
00:38:28,190 --> 00:38:29,520
and you might earn some leniency

925
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:30,710
and get a lighter sentence.

926
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:33,600
But if you keep being stubborn,

927
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:35,150
once the truth comes out,

928
00:38:36,190 --> 00:38:37,710
you'll face even harsher charges.

929
00:38:38,390 --> 00:38:39,390
The death penalty

930
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:41,390
can either be quick

931
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:43,630
or a slow, agonizing process.

932
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:46,120
Are you still not confessing?

933
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:50,360
Actually...

934
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:51,710
Zheng San and Jin Liu...

935
00:38:55,870 --> 00:38:57,470
Just say what it is.

936
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:03,230
You're interrogating them.

937
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:06,910
Their wives came

938
00:39:06,910 --> 00:39:08,190
to bring them food.

939
00:39:08,950 --> 00:39:10,120
If you won't talk, don't eat.

940
00:39:13,150 --> 00:39:14,320
Actually, it's just

941
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:19,190
like we said.

942
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:21,120
That's how it is.

943
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:22,320
Yes.

944
00:39:22,630 --> 00:39:23,470
You should get going.

945
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:25,190
We need to see our wives.

946
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:26,040
You two...

947
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:38,390
You two, come in.

948
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:50,480
[Jail]

949
00:39:51,910 --> 00:39:52,360
They're out.

950
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:13,320
Fresh fruits!

951
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:14,320
Madam,

952
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:15,560
these are all fine jewels.

953
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:16,520
Take a look.

954
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:19,760
Red beans, yellow beans,

955
00:40:20,470 --> 00:40:21,710
green beans and millet.

956
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:32,760
Red beans, yellow beans,

957
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:33,910
green beans and millet.

958
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:36,320
Come and see

959
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:37,800
a variety of toys

960
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:38,840
and fans.

961
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:39,840
Come take a look!

962
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:41,760
Come take a look!

963
00:40:44,630 --> 00:40:46,280
Come and see.

964
00:40:46,390 --> 00:40:47,190
Come!

965
00:40:49,430 --> 00:40:51,430
Come and see.

966
00:40:51,710 --> 00:40:53,390
Come and see the fans!

967
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:00,080
Come and see.

968
00:41:00,390 --> 00:41:02,040
Come see the fans!

969
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:03,600
Come and see.

970
00:41:06,870 --> 00:41:07,870
I'll try one.

971
00:41:08,390 --> 00:41:09,320
Go ahead.

972
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:11,910
Tasty!

973
00:41:11,910 --> 00:41:12,600
Good!

974
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:13,320
Thanks!

975
00:41:13,470 --> 00:41:14,360
Madam, take care!

976
00:41:16,430 --> 00:41:17,230
Here you go.

977
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:19,360
Boss,

978
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:20,760
give me a pound of sweet liquor.

979
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:21,470
Okay!

980
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:25,800
This woman...

981
00:41:26,390 --> 00:41:27,520
Her husband's in jail

982
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:28,360
waiting for execution,

983
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,040
and she is out enjoying herself.

984
00:41:32,630 --> 00:41:33,760
Come eat!

985
00:41:41,150 --> 00:41:42,080
Chopsticks!

986
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:45,760
There's oil residue.

987
00:41:46,190 --> 00:41:47,390
And there are shredded meats too.

988
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:49,000
Yes, there are shredded meats too.

989
00:41:49,470 --> 00:41:50,470
Eat more!

990
00:41:53,190 --> 00:41:54,430
Fresh fruits!

991
00:41:54,630 --> 00:41:55,950
Sir, want some?

992
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,150
Give them a try; they're very sweet.

993
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:07,840
Song is definitely up to something.

994
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:08,910
Yes.

995
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:10,520
He's not on duty today.

996
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:11,360
He must know

997
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:12,430
we're here again,

998
00:42:12,430 --> 00:42:13,430
and he's afraid those two bandits

999
00:42:13,430 --> 00:42:14,360
might really confess.

1000
00:42:15,150 --> 00:42:16,560
Last time during the interrogation,

1001
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:17,560
he was so eager

1002
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:18,710
to hurry us to eat.

1003
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:20,120
Right.

1004
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:21,430
Song

1005
00:42:21,430 --> 00:42:22,910
has no connection to us

1006
00:42:22,910 --> 00:42:24,000
and we don't know him,

1007
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:26,230
so why is he paying

1008
00:42:26,230 --> 00:42:27,520
for our meals?

1009
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:29,600
That's strange.

1010
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:31,710
Now it seems

1011
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,280
his treating us to dinner

1012
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:34,870
is more than just being generous.

1013
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:39,710
Could it be that these two bandits

1014
00:42:39,710 --> 00:42:41,000
already have a long criminal record

1015
00:42:41,430 --> 00:42:42,430
and someone's paying them

1016
00:42:42,430 --> 00:42:43,760
to take the blame?

1017
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:47,470
Lv Wanchang's family

1018
00:42:47,470 --> 00:42:48,800
may not meet with them directly.

1019
00:42:49,230 --> 00:42:50,190
There must be someone else

1020
00:42:50,190 --> 00:42:51,760
setting them up.

1021
00:42:52,870 --> 00:42:54,670
Song might be the one behind in Hejin.

1022
00:42:55,950 --> 00:42:57,470
There must be a mole in Linfen Yamen.
