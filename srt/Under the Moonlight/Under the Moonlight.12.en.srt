[Adapted from the novel
"Jin Nang" by Shui He]

00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:33,020
[Episode 12]

4
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:15,080
Ruhui, still working on that?

5
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:15,880
Come on,

6
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:18,000
have your medicine first,

7
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,190
so that you'll get better.

8
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:21,470
I've got everything covered.

9
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:22,270
Here.

10
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,030
I don't drink it, take it away.

11
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,320
If you don't take your medicine,

12
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:27,880
how can you get better?

13
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:28,880
Come on.

14
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:34,720
Do you have a mistress outside?

15
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,030
Don't be silly.

16
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:41,110
Come on,

17
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:42,750
let's finish the medicine first,

18
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:43,440
okay?

19
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:51,320
I...

20
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:53,470
I do have a mistress.

21
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:57,800
That's because of you!

22
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:09,960
You don't trust me.

23
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:13,600
I don't have a choice.

24
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:17,000
Drink it.

25
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,080
Drink it.

26
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:19,720
Drink.

27
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:25,880
Don't spit it out.

28
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:31,110
Drink up.

29
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,390
I'll kill you, you bastard!

30
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,640
If you kill him, you'll get caught.

31
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:34,230
Is that worth it?

32
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:34,880
It is.

33
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:37,790
I have to avenge my sister.

34
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,920
The county yamen
will deal with his crimes.

35
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,000
You have to believe that

36
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,720
Magistrate Han will punish the evil.

37
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:45,830
I am guilty.

38
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:46,920
I admit it.

39
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,760
But he's the ringleader.

40
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,320
He forced me to do all this.

41
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:53,390
How dare you?

42
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:55,200
Your Honor, please.

43
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:57,110
This is all his one-sided story.

44
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,790
He's like a rabid dog,

45
00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:00,040
accusing me to get himself off.

46
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:00,880
He's not credible.

47
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:02,320
Your Honor,

48
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,000
I have a copy of his prescription
as proof.

49
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:04,950
Present it.

50
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:05,830
Yes.

51
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:31,000
Every time Hua Miao
wrote a prescription,

52
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:31,830
He tore it up afterward.

53
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:34,270
Fortunately, I kept one.

54
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:36,480
Otherwise, I'd be framed.

55
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:39,510
He can forge letters and the will,

56
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:41,670
Of course
he can forge this prescription too.

57
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:43,230
Your Honor,

58
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,040
it's not forged.

59
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,720
Hua Miao

60
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:50,440
is White Fan,
the second-in-command of the White Ant.

61
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:52,320
Didn't you capture

62
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,350
two men of the White Fan?

63
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:54,880
You can bring them for confrontation.

64
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,600
It's self-evident.

65
00:05:57,790 --> 00:05:58,720
No need.

66
00:05:59,000 --> 00:05:59,830
Even if I am the White Fan,

67
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:00,670
so what?

68
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:02,350
I haven't killed anyone
or kidnapped anyone.

69
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:03,320
What crime have I committed?

70
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,270
It's not like that.

71
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:05,320
It's not like that at all.

72
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:06,720
Your Honor,

73
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:08,510
when someone kills with a knife,

74
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,480
it's the person who committed the crime,

75
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,070
not the knife.

76
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,830
I...I am just like the knife.

77
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,550
Please spare my life.

78
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:17,600
Your Honor, please spare my life.

79
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,230
Right.

80
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:20,760
For the sake of the baby.

81
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,760
I have an unborn child.

82
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:23,670
I can't let my child

83
00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:24,670
be born without a father.

84
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,720
Our family has one descendant
for three generations in a row.

85
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,760
After I married into the Qiao family,

86
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:28,320
I never thought

87
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,830
I'd have a child with the surname He.

88
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:30,600
But now I do.

89
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,270
I can't die.

90
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:33,670
I'm gonna give him a name

91
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:34,600
with the surname He.

92
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,270
I'll teach him to read and write.

93
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,200
Right, Qiu can testify.

94
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:41,830
Qiu,

95
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,160
tell the magistrate

96
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,950
that the prescription
was written by Hua Miao.

97
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:45,950
It's all his ideas.

98
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:46,950
Tell him.

99
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:48,270
Is what he said true?

100
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:50,000
I don't know.

101
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:52,110
I wasn't involved.

102
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:53,270
I don't know

103
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,790
about the prescription you said.

104
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,440
As far as I know,

105
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:59,720
Hua Miao is just
the doctor of the Qiao family.

106
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,350
He doesn't have
any malicious intentions.

107
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:03,550
He wouldn't come up with bad ideas.

108
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:04,720
Qiu,

109
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,390
even if you don't think of me,

110
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:08,950
think of our child!

111
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:09,230
No.

112
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:09,510
He can't...

113
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:10,920
It's not your baby.

114
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,640
His surname is not He.

115
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:23,920
Whose child is this?

116
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,550
It's yours.

117
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:37,480
You've been lying to me.

118
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:46,760
How did I lie  to you?

119
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:49,230
Did I force you to like Qiu?

120
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:51,160
It was you who get obsessed with Qiu

121
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,670
at your first sight.

122
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:54,160
I couldn't stop you.

123
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:57,040
I felt pity for you,

124
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,270
so I let it happen.

125
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,070
If you had ever acted like a real man,

126
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:01,160
this child's surname would be He.

127
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,390
But are you a man?

128
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:04,510
He Shenwei,

129
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:06,390
look at yourself.

130
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:07,320
You stupid fool.

131
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:09,880
You've had a bad character
since childhood.

132
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,670
Do you think you'll get rich

133
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:13,000
and achieve greatness

134
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:14,830
by marrying into the Qiao family?

135
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,270
You're just a kept man,

136
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:19,350
with good appearance,

137
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,720
but being lecherous.

138
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:23,640
I used to flatter and pamper you,

139
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,790
thinking of you as a pig

140
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:27,790
that I would fatten up
before slaughtering.

141
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:31,040
Little did I expect
that you're not even worthy of a pig.

142
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:39,710
He has to be alive.

143
00:08:39,790 --> 00:08:40,520
We can't let him die.

144
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:41,760
I'm gonna kill you!

145
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:42,790
Save him.

146
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,590
Hurry up.

147
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,880
He Shenwei has been sentenced to death.

148
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:05,710
Hua Miao can't escape punishment either.

149
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,960
Ruhui may rest in peace now.

150
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,320
Ruhui, come get me.

151
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,000
Come on!

152
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:30,790
Slow down.

153
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:37,350
Ruhui, what's this?

154
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:41,080
This is the raw material
for brewing liquor.

155
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:44,230
Is it fun?

156
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:45,000
Yes.

157
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,080
Do you want to learn
how to brew liquor with me?

158
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:47,710
Yes.

159
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:49,470
Let me tell you.

160
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:50,200
This...

161
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:14,000
If your sister's spirit
is watching over from heaven,

162
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:16,350
she must want you to live well

163
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:18,550
and brew good liquor for her.

164
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,440
Make yourself happier,

165
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:22,470
and she'll be happy too,

166
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:23,320
right?

167
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:05,200
Do you remember now?

168
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:08,030
Who's the leader of the White Ant?

169
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:09,470
Who are the junior leaders?

170
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:10,670
Where is the den of the White Ant?

171
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:17,000
Gathering people to be bandits,

172
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:19,230
kidnapping and selling women.

173
00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:20,710
Do you know that
these are serious crimes?

174
00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:30,520
If you have the evidence,

175
00:11:31,710 --> 00:11:32,590
just pass sentence.

176
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:34,440
You don't need to come

177
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,840
and interrogate me every day.

178
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:37,030
Do you really think

179
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:38,590
I can't sentence you to death?

180
00:11:41,710 --> 00:11:42,790
No matter what,

181
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:45,000
you have to sentence me
by the laws of the Ming Dynasty.

182
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:47,320
You will suffer from your stubbornness.

183
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:54,590
The worst case scenario is death.

184
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:58,880
I'm at your disposal,

185
00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:00,640
whatever you want.

186
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:01,440
Alright.

187
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:03,110
I'll let you know.

188
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:04,760
Though your life may be spared,

189
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:05,910
the punishment will be severe.

190

00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:36,110
I've known you for so long.

381
00:22:36,110 --> 00:22:36,560
I didn't expect you

382
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:38,470
to be so brave and skilled in battle.

383
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:40,400
Come on, let me give you a toast.

384
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:42,190
Don't say that.

385
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:44,310
Some say I'm useless.

386
00:22:44,310 --> 00:22:45,800
How could you be useless?

387
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:49,590
You've taken great risks

388
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:50,950
to eliminate a major threat

389
00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:52,230
for the people of our county.

390
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,590
I hereby express my gratitude to you.

391
00:22:53,590 --> 00:22:55,430
Han, don't mention it.

392
00:22:55,430 --> 00:22:56,800
It's no big deal.

393
00:22:57,350 --> 00:22:58,350
However,

394
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:00,710
from now on, my official rank

395
00:23:00,710 --> 00:23:02,560
will be higher than yours.

396
00:23:05,470 --> 00:23:06,190
Mr. Qi,

397
00:23:06,470 --> 00:23:07,880
you've been promoted so fast,

398
00:23:08,190 --> 00:23:09,710
did you achieve a Zhuangyuan
in the imperial examination?

399
00:23:09,950 --> 00:23:11,470
Don't be silly.

400
00:23:11,470 --> 00:23:12,350
That's because

401
00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:13,680
he begged Master for days

402
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:14,560
to get this

403
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:16,280
blank official appointment document.

404
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:17,950
That's how he got the position
as Deputy Commandant of Pingyangwei

405
00:23:17,950 --> 00:23:19,760
from Shanxi Regional
Military Commission.

406
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:23,310
Is this deputy commandant position

407
00:23:23,470 --> 00:23:24,950
even higher
than that of a magistrate?

408
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:26,640
That's true.

409
00:23:26,950 --> 00:23:28,760
He is the subordinate official
of the fifth rank.

410
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:30,190
Magistrate Han is
the seventh-rank official.

411
00:23:33,190 --> 00:23:34,760
Although you got this position easily,

412
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:36,350
you did go to suppress the bandits

413
00:23:36,350 --> 00:23:37,470
for real.

414
00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:39,190
You've been to the battlefield

415
00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:40,230
and experienced life and death.

416
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:41,760
Next time when you go to
the autopsy room,

417
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:43,430
you won't be screaming anymore.

418
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,160
Commandant Qi, a toast to you.

419
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:46,230
What experience?

420
00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:47,280
Mr. Cui organized

421
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:48,350
and deployed the action.

422
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:49,710
It was also Mr. Cui

423
00:23:49,710 --> 00:23:51,400
who led the charge
to capture the leader.

424
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:52,830
He didn't even touch a sword,

425
00:23:52,830 --> 00:23:53,640
just stood back and watched.

426
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:54,880
Can you shut up?

427
00:23:57,430 --> 00:23:58,950
And almost got his face scratched
by an unexpected arrow.

428
00:24:07,310 --> 00:24:08,590
Last time I was angry

429
00:24:08,830 --> 00:24:10,280
and said some unpleasant things.

430
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:11,350
Please forgive me.

431
00:24:13,230 --> 00:24:15,310
I'll drink this as an apology.

432
00:24:16,110 --> 00:24:17,560
With no regard for your own safety,

433
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:18,590
you led troops to eliminate the bandits,

434
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:20,040
upholding justice
for the people of Linfen,

435
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:21,230
and ensuring the safety here.

436
00:24:22,230 --> 00:24:23,230
I sincerely toast to you.

437
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:31,230
I also made a mistake that day.

438
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:34,040
I'm used to being
careless and unrestrained,

439
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,430
and I let my words slip out

440
00:24:35,430 --> 00:24:36,350
without thinking.

441
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:38,710
I regretted it after that day,

442
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:39,520
but

443
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:42,280
I didn't know how to apologize.

444
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:47,040
So, are we good?

445
00:24:47,950 --> 00:24:48,590
We're good.

446
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:50,470
Alright, let's eat.

447
00:24:51,710 --> 00:24:52,400
Come on.

448
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:55,560
Chen, I toast to you.

449
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:56,800
Today,

450
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:58,590
without the lamb you brought,

451
00:24:59,070 --> 00:25:00,310
this celebration feast

452
00:25:00,350 --> 00:25:01,560
would not be so great.

453
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:02,430
Commandant Qi,

454
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:03,830
if you feel sorry,

455
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:05,710
how about treating us again sometime?

456
00:25:05,950 --> 00:25:06,710
Okay.

457
00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:07,760
Tell me what you want to eat.

458
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:08,920
Mr. Qi,

459
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:10,160
how about you treat us to an opera?

460
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,310
I heard there was a troupe from Taiyuan.

461
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:13,680
I've never seen one

462
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:15,110
in my entire life.

463
00:25:15,230 --> 00:25:16,230
From Taiyuan?

464
00:25:16,470 --> 00:25:17,350
No problem.

465
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:20,230
Great.

466
00:25:20,590 --> 00:25:21,400
Come on.

467
00:25:28,430 --> 00:25:29,800
Chen, I didn't expect

468
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:31,400
you to be a native of Linfen.

469
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:32,520
I thought you and Han

470
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:33,350
were from the same place.

471
00:25:34,070 --> 00:25:34,950
We used to

472
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,430
studied in the same school.

473
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:37,680
Unfortunately,

474
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:39,230
I wasn't as good at studying as Han

475
00:25:39,310 --> 00:25:41,070
and failed to get a Jinshi
in the imperial examination,

476
00:25:41,070 --> 00:25:42,710
so I just went home.

477
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:48,430
Since you're home,

478
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:49,310
why didn't you

479
00:25:49,310 --> 00:25:51,280
marry that young lady?

480
00:25:52,830 --> 00:25:54,230
You're not being honest.

481
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:56,190
If it weren't for your father
coming today,

482
00:25:56,190 --> 00:25:57,000
we wouldn't even know

483
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:57,830
you have a fiancee.

484
00:25:58,950 --> 00:26:00,280
What fiancee?

485
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:01,590
Yeah, Mr. Chen,

486
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:02,680
we didn't know that.

487
00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:05,470
Mr. Chen, could you tell us,

488
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:07,560
is Zao Hua pretty?

489
00:26:08,470 --> 00:26:10,760
I doubt it.

490
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:11,590
If she were pretty,

491
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:12,470
he would have married her already.

492
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:13,160
If not nice,

493
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:14,070
just shut up.

494
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:15,190
Yeah, don't say that.

495
00:26:15,190 --> 00:26:16,590
Mr. Chen, tell us.

496
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:18,430
What does Zao Hua look like?

497
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:20,070
Tell my little sister.

498
00:26:21,110 --> 00:26:22,070
She looks just like my father.

499
00:26:27,710 --> 00:26:29,000
You're so unfilial.

500
00:26:36,830 --> 00:26:38,040
I see you guys

501
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:38,800
are not hungry.

502
00:26:39,470 --> 00:26:40,040
We are.

503
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:40,880
Don't.

504
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:41,640
We're hungry.

505
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:42,280
We really are.

506
00:26:43,230 --> 00:26:43,760
Yeah.

507
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:06,830
On behalf of all the women in Linfen,

508
00:27:06,830 --> 00:27:07,800
thank you, Your Honor.

509
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:10,800
What for?

510
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:12,560
Because you can see

511
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:13,560
the sufferings of women,

512
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:14,950
and you are willing to

513
00:27:14,950 --> 00:27:15,950
stand up for them.

514
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:17,920
That is

515
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:19,640
my duty as an official.

516
00:27:21,190 --> 00:27:21,710
It's different.

517
00:27:21,830 --> 00:27:23,230
I can feel that you sincerely sympathize

518
00:27:23,230 --> 00:27:24,190
with them.

519
00:27:41,430 --> 00:27:42,920
Actually, I have another reason.

520
00:27:46,590 --> 00:27:48,470
I'm determined
to eliminate the White Ant

521
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:51,160
for the good of the people

522
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:52,880
and

523
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:55,710
for you.

524
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,430
I heard you performing yesterday.

525
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:04,920
I was upset yesterday,

526
00:28:05,070 --> 00:28:05,880
and there was no way to vent,

527
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:06,310
so I...

528
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:07,350
You worried about me.

529
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,000
You worried
that if the operation failed,

530
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:10,920
I would be implicated.

531
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:12,400
Just like how I felt
when I

532
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,950
thought of those bandits almost making me lose you forever.

533
00:28:13,950 --> 00:28:14,560
I really wanted to

534
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:16,160
cut them into pieces.

535
00:28:19,310 --> 00:28:19,880
Luo Shu,

536
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:23,560
the reason why
I am so concerned about you

537
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:25,710
is because

538
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:29,880
I like you.

539
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:34,590
What about you?

540
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:37,830
Do you want to be with me?

541
00:28:46,830 --> 00:28:48,190
You don't have to answer now.

542
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:49,710
Tomorrow,

543
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:51,520
I'll be here waiting for you

544
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:53,760
to finish this game with me.

545
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:16,070
Miss Luo,

546
00:29:16,070 --> 00:29:17,160
why aren't you eating?

547
00:29:19,590 --> 00:29:21,680
I'm not hungry. Here you are.

548
00:29:22,310 --> 00:29:23,310
Thank you, Miss Luo.

549
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:32,430
Baozi, leave us some space.

550
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:33,920
I want to talk to her.

551
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:56,280
About you and Muzhi,

552
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:58,470
I advise you to give up.

553
00:30:00,470 --> 00:30:01,560
What do you mean?

554
00:30:02,310 --> 00:30:04,760
You said you wanted
to escape from a low social status,

555
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:06,710
and work at the county yamen.

556
00:30:07,350 --> 00:30:10,110
Although it was unorthodox for me,

557
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:13,160
I wasn't completely opposed to it.

558
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:15,190
You're smart,

559
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:18,110
and it's helpful in solving cases.

560
00:30:18,590 --> 00:30:20,280
But I've been wondering,

561
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,430
you've been living a luxurious life

562
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:24,280
in Mingke House,

563
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:24,920
how can you

564
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:26,430
settle for

565
00:30:26,830 --> 00:30:28,040
the hardships here?

566
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:29,830
You do the work of a petty official,

567
00:30:30,190 --> 00:30:31,520
without an official position

568
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:32,710
or salary.

569
00:30:32,710 --> 00:30:33,710
Until recently,

570
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:35,760
I found out

571
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:37,400
you've been getting closer

572
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:38,950
to Muzhi.

573
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:42,680
Now I get it.

574
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:45,110
So you think I'm staying here

575
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:47,350
just for vanity,

576
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:48,470
and I'm trying to approach him?

577
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:50,640
Is that true?

578
00:30:52,470 --> 00:30:53,280
No.

579
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:59,830
So you really like him.

580
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,190
If that's true,

581
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:05,000
you're even more silly.

582
00:31:05,710 --> 00:31:06,950
Do you really think

583
00:31:07,430 --> 00:31:08,880
you can be with him?

584
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:11,520
Even if you become a decent citizen

585
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:13,470
and you're willing to be his concubine,

586
00:31:13,470 --> 00:31:14,230
I'm telling you,

587
00:31:14,230 --> 00:31:15,680
his future wife and father-in-law

588
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:17,160
won't accept you.

589
00:31:18,830 --> 00:31:19,640
That's true.

590
00:31:20,710 --> 00:31:23,230
Muzhi is already engaged.

591
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:25,800
His future father-in-law

592
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,280
is Liu Yiqing, our provincial governor

593
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:29,640
serving as the Deputy Right Chief Censor
of the Censorate,

594
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:30,800
the Deputy Minister of War,

595
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:32,760
as well as the second-rank official.

596
00:31:32,950 --> 00:31:34,560
Do you think he'll tolerate

597
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:35,680
a woman like you

598
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,880
entering his family?

599
00:31:38,470 --> 00:31:41,430
Besides, according to
the laws of the Ming Dynasty,

600
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:44,470
any official who marries a performer
as wife or concubine,

601
00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:45,800
shall be punished
with sixty lashes and divorce.

602
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:47,070
If Muzhi marries you,

603
00:31:47,070 --> 00:31:49,070
he'll give up his career.

604
00:31:54,590 --> 00:31:56,040
I respect Muzhi.

605
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:59,280
He's the one
who can achieve something great.

606
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:00,950
He should stand higher

607
00:32:01,110 --> 00:32:02,040
and go further,

608
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:03,760
to fulfill his ambitions.

609
00:32:04,710 --> 00:32:06,160
If you really like him,

610
00:32:07,070 --> 00:32:09,190
you shouldn't be an obstacle for him.

611
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:11,430
If

612
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:14,000
you insist on standing in his way,

613
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:18,710
I will help him cut the knot.

614
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:29,110
Don't worry.

615
00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:31,190
I know my place.

616
00:32:34,190 --> 00:32:35,160
I'm sorry,

617
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:38,560
but I know Muzhi.

618
00:32:39,350 --> 00:32:40,590
He's already fallen in love.

619
00:32:41,070 --> 00:32:44,070
I hope you can make him give up on you.

620
00:32:44,350 --> 00:32:45,310
It's good

621
00:32:46,110 --> 00:32:46,760
for him

622
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:48,520
and for you.

623
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:28,190
Cai, remember to help me

624
00:34:28,190 --> 00:34:29,280
get a good seat.

625
00:34:29,670 --> 00:34:30,470
Got it.

626
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:34,430
Your Honor.

627
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:38,670
You've been working
for the whole morning.

628
00:34:38,670 --> 00:34:39,670
Come and take a break.

629
00:34:39,950 --> 00:34:40,870
Here is your lunch.

630
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:43,360
Okay.

631
00:34:48,390 --> 00:34:49,870
I heard you mention getting a seat.

632
00:34:49,950 --> 00:34:50,840
For what?

633
00:34:50,950 --> 00:34:51,910
For watching the opera.

634
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,150
Mr. Qi is treating everyone

635
00:34:53,150 --> 00:34:54,870
to the opera this afternoon.

636
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:55,950
The opera?

637
00:34:56,710 --> 00:34:59,080
Right. He promised you last time

638
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:00,080
when we had lamb.

639
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:01,840
Would you like to join us?

640
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:03,320
No.

641
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:04,430
I have a lot of work to do.

642
00:35:05,230 --> 00:35:07,120
Just take a break this afternoon.

643
00:35:07,150 --> 00:35:08,000
Everyone's going.

644
00:35:08,910 --> 00:35:10,470
It's a pity if you don't come.

645
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:13,470
Everyone?

646
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,870
Will Luo Shu

647
00:35:16,470 --> 00:35:18,800
and Meiqing be going too?

648
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:20,280
Mr. Qi begged Miss Luo for a long time

649
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:21,600
before she agreed to go.

650
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:23,950
Okay, I got it.

651
00:35:24,950 --> 00:35:25,800
Enjoy your lunch.

652
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:32,760
Let's go.

653
00:35:36,470 --> 00:35:37,150
Have a seat.

654
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:57,360
Han.

655
00:35:58,150 --> 00:35:59,520
Chen, have a seat.

656
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,080
She won't show up, will she?

657
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:29,280
Now, please enjoy

658
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:30,390
the Legend of Purple Hairpin.

659
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,950
Great.

660
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:36,150
Great.

661
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:38,600
Here you come.

662
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:39,390
This way.

663
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:46,760
Sit here.

664
00:36:57,630 --> 00:37:13,040
With my own hands,

665
00:37:14,390 --> 00:37:33,760
I stitched battle attire for my husband.

666
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:41,230
Dear wife.

667
00:37:41,230 --> 00:37:45,630
Dear husband.

668
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:51,230
Yi.
[*The name of the husband is Li Yi.]

669
00:37:53,630 --> 00:37:59,190
Once apart,

670
00:37:59,870 --> 00:38:10,000
how shall I go on with my life?

671
00:38:11,150 --> 00:38:12,870
My dear.

672
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:17,150
How I fear the hardships of the frontier

673
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:23,910
will leave me unfit for you.

674
00:38:23,910 --> 00:38:26,390
This Li Yi is loyal and righteous.

675
00:38:28,470 --> 00:38:33,320
We will be separated for eight years,

676
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:34,120
Where are you going?

677
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:36,520
To the restroom.

678
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:48,190
and my youth will also be gone by then.

679
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:58,040
After that, you could have
a suitable consort

680
00:38:58,040 --> 00:38:59,390
to find new happiness.

681
00:38:59,390 --> 00:39:00,190
Mr. Chen.

682
00:39:00,190 --> 00:39:01,950
Have you seen this play?

683
00:39:02,710 --> 00:39:03,150
Yes.

684
00:39:04,190 --> 00:39:05,600
So what happened to them later?

685
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:06,360
Did they end up together?

686
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:10,190
No, they won't.

687
00:39:45,430 --> 00:39:46,840
You didn't come last night.

688
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,190
Did you make a decision?

689
00:39:51,710 --> 00:39:53,470
You have a promising future.

690
00:39:53,950 --> 00:39:55,520
You shouldn't be wasted on me.

691
00:39:57,390 --> 00:39:58,280
Did you know

692
00:39:58,280 --> 00:39:59,000
about my engagement?

693
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,000
Did you understand

694
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:02,000
the play just now?

695
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:04,040
Li Yi and Huo Xiaoyu

696
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:05,430
went through countless hardships

697
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:07,840
and finally ended up together.

698
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:10,470
He didn't marry Marshal Lu's daughter.

699
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:11,910
He only married Huo Xiaoyu.

700
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:14,230
I've watched this play before.

701
00:40:14,870 --> 00:40:16,000
I used to deeply admire their love

702
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,910
that defied conventional norms.

703
00:40:18,230 --> 00:40:19,840
I used to marvel

704
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:21,600
at their fiery pursuit

705
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:22,840
of happiness and freedom.

706
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:24,520
But today,

707
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:26,280
every line

708
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:28,080
makes me feel like thorns in my back.

709
00:40:28,910 --> 00:40:30,120
So I'm sure now.

710
00:40:30,950 --> 00:40:32,280
Hoping to find a soul mate

711
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:34,080
with whom I want to be for life.

712
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:36,560
That's my ideal love.

713
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:38,040
My future husband

714
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:39,710
has to give me a formal marriage.

715
00:40:39,950 --> 00:40:41,800
He can only love me for his life.

716
00:40:42,390 --> 00:40:43,670
If he couldn't,

717
00:40:44,710 --> 00:40:46,320
it's better to break up early.

718
00:40:49,950 --> 00:40:50,760
I know

719
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:52,670
such a marriage

720
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,840
is impossible between us.

721
00:40:55,390 --> 00:40:56,870
You're the Jinshi,

722
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:59,950
while I'm still in a lowly status.

723
00:41:00,430 --> 00:41:02,120
There's a huge gap between us.

724
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:05,840
I guess when you said
you wanted to be with me,

725
00:41:06,710 --> 00:41:08,670
you just wanted to take me
as your concubine.

726
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:10,630
Sorry,

727
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:12,950
I don't want to be with you.

728
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,190
Hoping to find a soul mate

729
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,280
with whom I want to be for life.

730
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:45,360
Put it there.

731
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:50,630
Your Honor,

732
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:52,760
White Ants have all confessed.

733
00:41:53,190 --> 00:41:54,520
Here are their statements.

734
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:06,910
Okay.

735
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:11,080
According to their confessions,

736
00:42:11,430 --> 00:42:13,190
Captain Cai has arrested
some of their accomplices.

737
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:14,870
Some of the missing women

738
00:42:14,870 --> 00:42:16,150
have been rescued

739
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:17,870
and returned to their families.

740
00:42:18,950 --> 00:42:20,080
What about the others?

741
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:21,430
The White Ant claims

742
00:42:21,430 --> 00:42:22,670
their biggest accomplice

743
00:42:22,670 --> 00:42:23,800
operates in secret.

744
00:42:23,870 --> 00:42:24,560
And they only want

745
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:26,000
smart and beautiful women.

746
00:42:26,470 --> 00:42:27,800
The other missing women

747
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:29,320
should have been captured by them.

748
00:42:29,670 --> 00:42:31,560
No one has seen their true face.

749
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:34,840
They must have a reason
for being so cautious.

750
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:38,430
Continue to interrogate.

751
00:42:38,910 --> 00:42:39,950
See if we can get

752
00:42:39,950 --> 00:42:41,320
any other useful clues.

753
00:42:42,910 --> 00:42:43,520
Got it.

754
00:42:44,150 --> 00:42:45,120
I'll be leaving now.
