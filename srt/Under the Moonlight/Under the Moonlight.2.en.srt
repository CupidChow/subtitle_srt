[Episode 2]

4
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:51,550
Quick, over there!

5
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:51,800
Go!

6
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:52,270
Hurry!

7
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:15,440
She really played

8
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,910
with a heroic spirit!

9
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:19,000
What kind

10
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:20,960
of hero

11
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,670
deserves such beauty.

12
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:25,190
It must be the richest one.

13
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:33,240
Great!

14
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,190
Great!

15
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,520
Great!

16
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:39,000
Everyone, quiet!

17
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:40,550
Gentlemen,

18
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:42,750
I bet you're all eager!

19
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:45,080
Then let's begin now.

20
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:46,270
Let's see

21
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:48,830
who can spend the night with Jin Nang.

22
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:50,080
I'll bid thirty liang.

23
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,110
Fifty liang!

24
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:53,550
I'll go eighty liang.

25
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:55,160
I'll bid one hundred liang.

26
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,830
I'll go one hundred and fifty liang.

27
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:58,630
One hundred and fifty liang!

28
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:59,750
One hundred and fifty liang!

29
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,390
I'll bid two hundred liang.

30
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:03,240
Two hundred liang!

31
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:05,390
Three hundred liang.

32
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,440
Three hundred liang!

33
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:10,670
The top performers at these dance halls

34
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:12,750
make no more than two hundred liang
on their first night.

35
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:13,910
Exactly!

36
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:15,670
Our master is generous.

37
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:17,110
What's it to you?

38
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:18,080
Old rascal!

39
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,830
If you don't like it, bid higher!

40
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,270
Since no one's raising the bid,

41
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:26,160
the lucky one tonight is...

42
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,470
Three hundred and one liang!

43
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:31,750
Who is that?

44
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:36,390
Three hundred and fifty liang!

45
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:38,800
Three hundred and fifty-one liang!

46
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:39,800
Three hundred and fifty-one!

47
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:42,320
Four hundred liang!

48
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,440
Four hundred liang!

49
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,110
Four hundred and one liang!

50
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:52,190
Young Master, this is silver,

51
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:53,000
not stones.

52
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,470
Go ahead and call out!

53
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,470
No matter how much you say,

54
00:03:58,550 --> 00:04:00,160
I'll still outbid you by one liang.

55
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:01,190
Are you

56
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:02,520
looking for trouble?

57
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,080
My young master is willing!

58
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,110
What's it to you?

59
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:06,830
Oh no!

60
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:07,910
Young Master!

61
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:09,160
Let's just play around!

62
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:10,360
Don't spend real money!

63
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:11,720
Sir!

64
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:12,800
No, old man!

65
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:14,830
How old are you?

66
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:15,750
I...

67
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:18,270
What's that to you?

68
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:19,920
I'm just worried about you.

69
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,070
Look at your health.

70
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:24,440
Even if you win the night,

71
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:27,390
I'm afraid your health can't take it.

72
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:34,110
Don't let fun cost you your life.

73
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:36,920
Besides,

74
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:39,920
"fun" is for talented people.

75
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:41,070
At your age,

76
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:42,480
you're about as old as their grandpa.

77
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:47,670
Five hundred liang!

78
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:54,040
Miss,

79
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,790
what are you doing?

80
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:57,760
I just heard

81
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:59,070
a rich guest was bidding high.

82
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:00,070
I wanted to take a look.

83
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,160
Jin Nang,

84
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:05,040
you should stay inside.

85
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,350
This rich guest

86
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:08,110
will come to find you soon.

87
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:19,200
Five hundred and one liang.

88
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:26,670
Do you really think

89
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:27,640
it's classy

90
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:28,880
for an old man to chase a young woman?

91
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:30,760
You want a young woman

92
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:31,640
to entertain you?

93
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:32,880
I won't let you get your way!

94
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:33,640
Right!

95
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:35,230
That old man is very bad.

96
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:36,350
We can't let him succeed.

97
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:37,480
We can't let him succeed.

98
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:42,440
What are you

99
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,040
in such a hurry for?

100
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:46,550
You're out of money,

101
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:47,390
trying to borrow some?

102
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:49,600
If you need money,
I can lend you 100 liang!

103
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:50,790
What?

104
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:52,920
Do you have money or not?

105
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:55,230
Look,

106
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:57,270
your collar is all crooked.

107
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:58,790
Could it be

108
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:00,390
that this outfit is borrowed too?

109
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:06,230
Don't go, come back!

110
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:07,320
He has no money!

111
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:13,200
Looks like tonight's winner

112
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:14,350
is me.

113
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:16,230
Thank you!

114
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,070
Thanks, thanks, thanks!

115
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,640
Congratulations, congratulations!

116
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:23,160
Thank you!

117
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:26,070
Sir, please go to the private room.

118
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,440
This way, Sir.

119
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:32,160
What are you doing?

120
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:33,830
If Jin Nang

121
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:35,320
ends up with that man,

122
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:37,350
how do we explain to the master?

123
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,950
What can I do?

124
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:42,390
This unexpected turn of events
caught me off guard.

125
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:43,200
If you

126
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,920
had kept a closer eye on her,

127
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:47,670
she wouldn't have connected
with the authorities.

128
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:48,790
And this

129
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:50,110
wouldn't have happened.

130
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:53,390
Now, go send him away.

131
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:57,720
How do I send him away?

132
00:06:58,510 --> 00:06:59,880
Figure it out yourself.

133
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:01,670
Otherwise,

134
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,950
you know what's coming.

135
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,000
Okay.

136
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:09,350
Young Master, you spent

137
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:11,320
five hundred liang just like that!

138
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:14,040
Saving the beauty in front of everyone

139
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:16,510
was worth it!

140
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,920
Sir, sorry to keep you waiting.

141
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:22,000
Are you taking me

142
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,270
to see Jin Nang?

143
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,790
Don't rush, Sir.

144
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,600
This fun night

145
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,270
can't be rushed, right?

146
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,480
Besides,

147
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,110
five hundred liang

148
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,830
isn't a small amount.

149
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:36,670
Did you really bring

150
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:38,070
so much money?

151
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,350
You're worried

152
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:45,160
I can't pay that much.

153
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,510
So you're holding me here?

154
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,720
Yes, we really can't

155
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,720
afford that much.

156
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:52,000
Let's go.

157
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:53,480
Let's go.

158
00:07:54,670 --> 00:07:55,950
You can't afford that!

159
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:59,000
That's really too bad.

160
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,760
Sir, come back next time.

161
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:01,720
Wait, wait, wait!

162
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,230
What are you talking about?

163
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:05,200
Pay up!

164
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:08,440
I really didn't bring it!

165
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,760
You stingy miser,
always causing trouble!

166
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:23,350
This is more than five hundred liang.

167
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:24,480
Look closely.

168
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:29,000
You've seen the money.

169
00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:30,480
Now it's my turn.

170
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:33,110
I need to check Jin Nang.

171
00:08:34,670 --> 00:08:35,470
Check Jin Nang?

172
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:36,320
Right.

173
00:08:36,790 --> 00:08:38,670
I want to see Jin Nang now.

174
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:42,710
Every gentleman in Linfen

175
00:08:42,710 --> 00:08:45,350
knows Jin Nang.

176
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:55,350
Could it be that you're a stranger here?

177
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,350
So what if I am?

178
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:00,230
You're bullying me!

179
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:03,520
No, no, no, how could I?

180
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,200
It's just
that you haven't met Jin Nang before.

181
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:09,670
You should definitely meet her first.

182
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:11,470
Lead the way.

183
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:13,280
Sir,

184
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,080
it's daylight.

185
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,880
Going into a lady's room

186
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,030
isn't appropriate.

187
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,520
Let me

188
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:21,110
notify her first,

189
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:22,110
then I'll bring you in.

190
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:36,520
Miss, are you alright?

191
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:44,910
This way, quick!

192
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:45,320
Go!

193
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:45,670
Hurry!

194
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:46,030
Go!

195
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,230
There's a mouse!

196
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:56,440
A mouse!

197
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:58,150
Jin Nang!

198
00:09:58,150 --> 00:09:59,280
There! There's a mouse!

199
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:00,080
A mouse!

200
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,000
Where is it?

201
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,350
It's over there, inside!

202
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:09,150
Inside!

203
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:21,280
You.

204
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:28,350
You're trying to escape?

205
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,110
Want to grab the incense burner?

206
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,710
You little brat, I won't let you escape!

207
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:56,110
Please, Sir.

208
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:28,320
Jin Nang, he is here to see you.

209
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:32,640
Come meet your groom!

210
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,840
Why are you so shy?

211
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:39,280
Hurry up!

212
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:04,670
Sir,

213
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:06,760
please sit down.

214
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:08,840
No need, I...

215
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:10,880
I'll just sit on a stool.

216
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:26,320
Sir,

217
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:30,000
how about we drink
until we're both drunk?

218
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,200
Um...

219
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:36,000
Miss, you might be misunderstanding.

220
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:37,470
I'm not like

221
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:38,200
those lechers outside.

222
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:41,440
Please don't say
it's a misunderstanding.

223
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:42,760
It's fate.

224
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:45,760
I'll definitely take good care of you.

225
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,030
Miss, miss.

226
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:49,520
I really didn't mean it like that.

227
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:50,790
I just don't want

228
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:52,960
that old man

229
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,030
to take advantage of you.

230
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:55,110
So I stepped in.

231
00:12:55,590 --> 00:12:56,910
You're really righteous.

232
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:59,080
I like this about you.

233
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:00,470
No, no, stop.

234
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:01,230
No, no, no.

235
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:02,150
Lian Shu. Lian Shu.

236
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:03,200
Lian Shu, help me!

237
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,030
Young Master!

238
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,230
Jin Nang!

239
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:07,640
How are you serving him?

240
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:08,840
Madam, I...

241
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:11,000
No, it's not her fault.

242
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:21,080
Oh no.

243
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:22,590
Sir,

244
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:25,230
you were just in a hurry

245
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:26,110
to see Jin Nang.

246
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:26,840
Why

247
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,080
are you shy now?

248
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:33,400
I wasn't even

249
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:35,320
coming for that.

250
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:37,520
I just passed by.

251
00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:40,520
After hearing Jin Nang play the pipa,

252
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:41,760
I was impressed.

253
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,200
Honestly, this five hundred liang

254
00:13:44,110 --> 00:13:47,150
is nothing to me.

255
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,400
Since five hundred liang

256
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,590
is nothing to you,

257
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:54,910
just pay up!

258
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:09,590
No!

259
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,030
It hurts, it hurts!

260
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,550
I'm in pain!

261
00:14:17,710 --> 00:14:19,470
Madam, Jin Nang's running away!

262
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:20,590
She ran!

263
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:22,230
Jin Nang's gone!

264
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:23,550
So she...

265
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,230
She is Jin Nang.

266
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:26,200
Jin Nang!

267
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,350
Take good care of them.

268
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,080
Yes!

269
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:28,840
Shut the door!

270
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,000
Old witch, how dare you trick me!

271
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:34,400
Open the door!

272
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:35,200
Sir!

273
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:36,590
Don't touch me!

274
00:14:36,590 --> 00:14:37,080
Sir!

275
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:37,710
Don't touch me!

276
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:40,110
Someone, come here!

277
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:42,840
Come here, come here!

278
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:44,200
Search for Jin Nang!

279
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:46,200
She can't escape from Mingke House!

280
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:47,230
Search for her!

281
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:48,110
You, over here!

282
00:14:48,110 --> 00:14:48,840
You, over there!

283
00:14:52,590 --> 00:14:53,280
Chase her!

284
00:14:56,670 --> 00:14:57,470
Madam!

285
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,230
She's over there!

286
00:14:59,230 --> 00:14:59,640
Chase her!

287
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:00,960
Chase, chase, chase!

288
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,640
Stop right there!

289
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:03,350
Stop!

290
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:06,350
Hurry, hurry!

291
00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:07,710
Madam!

292
00:15:07,710 --> 00:15:09,110
Don't worry about me. Just chase!

293
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:11,440
Stop!

294
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:12,030
Don't run!

295
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:14,880
Catch her!

296
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:17,640
Don't run, don't run!

297
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:18,550
Stop!

298
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:20,790
Stop! Stop!

299
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:21,710
Don't run!

300
00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:22,400
Catch her!

301
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:23,200
Keep chasing!

302
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:23,910
Stop running! Stop!

303
00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:25,110
Catch her!

304
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:26,030
Catch her!

305
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:27,110
Stop!

306
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:28,670
Stop! Don't run!

307
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:29,280
Stop!

308
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,110
Stop!

309
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:31,230
Don't run!

310
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:32,080
Sorry, sir.

311
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:32,790
Are you okay?

312
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:34,000
Get out of the way!

313
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:37,350
Madam, we got her!

314
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:38,640
We got her!

315
00:15:41,710 --> 00:15:42,790
Little brat,

316
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,590
you can really run!

317
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:46,670
Think you can escape my grip?

318
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,550
You insist on claiming my virginity.

319
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:49,320
Isn't it just to

320
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:50,640
make me earn more money for you?

321
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:52,440
As long as you're easy on me,

322
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:54,400
I'll make sure
to earn enough money for you.

323
00:15:55,110 --> 00:15:56,520
But if you force me,

324
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,350
I'd rather die!

325
00:16:00,110 --> 00:16:01,910
You dare threaten me?

326
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,840
Tie her up and take her away!

327
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:08,670
Catch her!

328
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:09,910
Catch her!

329
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,080
If you push me again,

330
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:13,080
I'll jump from here.

331
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,080
Blood will splatter everywhere,

332
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,280
and the whole Linfen will know

333
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:16,960
that Mingke House is a cursed place.

334
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,230
Let's see how you do business then.

335
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:18,790
You!

336
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:20,400
Do you want to lose everything?

337
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:26,200
You, calm down.

338
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:27,670
Don't get worked up.

339
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:28,520
Stay calm.

340
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:29,840
Come down.

341
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:31,150
Let's talk this out.

342
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:33,030
Let's talk it out.

343
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:39,350
Hold on tight!

344
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,280
Don't let go!

345
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:53,640
Hold tight, hold tight!

346
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:55,400
You guys!

347
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,640
Quick, catch her!

348
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:57,440
If she falls and gets hurt,

349
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,760
none of you will survive!

350
00:16:58,790 --> 00:16:59,590
Hurry up!

351
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:01,030
Hold tight, hold tight!

352
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,320
Get down!

353
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:05,310
Jin Nang!

354
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:09,920
What are you doing?

355
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:11,950
How dare you! The magistrate is here!

356
00:17:11,950 --> 00:17:12,710
Help her!

357
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:15,310
Oh no.

358
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:16,280
Jin Nang!

359
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:17,000
This is bad.

360
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,160
Jin Nang's in trouble outside!

361
00:17:25,950 --> 00:17:26,760
Your Honor!

362
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,560
Tonight is Jin Nang's big night.

363
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:29,520
If you take her away,

364
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,470
how can I explain this to the guest?

365
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:32,430
It's easy.

366
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,230
Tell him to come to the count hall

367
00:17:34,230 --> 00:17:35,280
and ask me for her.

368
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:37,400
That's not

369
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,710
being reasonable!

370
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:41,280
Jin Nang is one of our girls
from Mingke House.

371
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:42,430
I've taken good care of her

372
00:17:42,430 --> 00:17:43,710
and raised her well.

373
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,560
You can't just say

374
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:46,710
"take her" like that.

375
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:47,400
You're out of line!

376
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,040
How dare you
speak to the magistrate like that?

377
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:50,520
You want to take my girl

378
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:51,640
and not let me say a word?

379
00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:53,880
Magistrate Han already agreed with me.

380
00:17:54,190 --> 00:17:55,680
You know this too, right?

381
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:56,920
I don't know.

382
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,350
I don't know anything.

383
00:17:58,470 --> 00:17:59,590
If you don't know anything,

384
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:01,310
why are you
insisting on doing this today?

385
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:02,830
This was arranged

386
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:04,830
two months ago.

387
00:18:05,470 --> 00:18:07,230
You really know how to twist the truth.

388
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,190
If you really wanted to get out,

389
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:12,000
you, a man,

390
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,400
shouldn't be stopped by a door.

391
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:16,000
Sure.

392
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:18,310
A mere door can't stop me.

393
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:22,520
One, two,

394
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:25,280
go!

395
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:29,680
Young Master!

396
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:31,470
Did you fall? Hurt yourself?

397
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:33,640
I'm fine.

398
00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:36,800
Madam, why do you

399
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:37,830
keep bothering me?

400
00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:42,310
Jin Nang, I'm begging you!

401
00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:43,350
You can't leave!

402
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:44,110
If you leave,

403
00:18:44,110 --> 00:18:45,760
I won't be able to live either.

404
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:48,920
Take her away!

405
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:49,400
Yes.

406
00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:50,680
You can't let her go.

407
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,000
Let's see who dares to stop us.

408
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:03,040
Let's go!

409
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:03,950
Yes.

410
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:06,280
You can't take her away!

411
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:07,560
Can't take her away!

412
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:08,040
Your Honor!

413
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:09,560
Please, let my daughter go!

414
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:10,230
If she leaves,

415
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:11,760
I won't survive either.

416
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:14,830
Is the big shot

417
00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:15,640
interested in Jin Nang

418
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:16,950

419
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:18,880
But why did he...?

420
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:19,560
Where's Jin Nang?

421
00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:22,400
Meiqing, take them away first.

422
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:23,230
Yes.

423
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:28,520
You can't go!

424
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:29,920
Say whatever you want to say to me.

425
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:33,070
As the local official,

426
00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:34,560
you rob a woman in broad daylight.

427
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:35,760
Is there no law anymore?

428
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,310
In broad daylight,
you forcibly take a woman.

429
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:40,680
Do you have any respect for the law?

430
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:45,040
Who are you?

431
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:46,280
You're not worthy to ask my name.

432
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:47,110
As the magistrate,

433
00:19:47,110 --> 00:19:48,350
you rob a woman in daylight.

434
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:49,400
Do you have any respect for the law?

435
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:51,310
You reckless fool!

436
00:19:51,310 --> 00:19:52,310
You dare act like this
in front of the magistrate?

437
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:53,160
Let go of him!

438
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:55,680
Lian Shu!

439
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:56,640
Let go!

440
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,280
Take them all away!

441
00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:00,830
Let go!

442
00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:01,400
Behave yourself!

443
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:03,760
I'll remember your face!

444
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:06,680
I was from a good family.

445
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:08,760
But fate had other plans.

446
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,350
So I ended up in Mingke House,

447
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:11,520
reduced to such a state.

448
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:12,880
All these years,

449
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,590
I tried everything

450
00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:15,830
to escape from Mingke House.

451
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:17,430
But I never succeeded.

452
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:19,430
That day,

453
00:20:19,430 --> 00:20:20,760
Madam was trying
to arrange my first night,

454
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:22,800
and I truly had no way out.

455
00:20:23,310 --> 00:20:24,830
It was you who saved me.

456
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:26,760
Please, show mercy,

457
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:28,400
and help us

458
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,680
escape this suffering.

459
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,520
This isn't a small matter.

460
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:33,760
Let me discuss it

461
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:34,950
with the magistrate.

462
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,000
You two go back first

463
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:37,190
and wait a few days.

464
00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:39,000
What did you say?

465
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:40,520
Go back?

466
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:43,520
[Linfen Yamen]
We two sisters

467
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:44,590
only came out

468
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:45,760
after breaking ties with Madam.

469
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,560
If you send us back now,

470
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:48,640
won't it be like

471
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:49,830
sending us to our deaths?

472
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:50,310
You!

You all volunteered back then.

Mr. Chen!

475
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:00,830
Let the two ladies

476

stay at the Linfen Inn for now.

Arrange that.

478
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:05,110
Yes.

479
00:21:08,190 --> 00:21:09,400
Once I check your records

480
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,590
and everything is clear,

481
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,310
I'll apply for your removal
from the register.

482

you can clear our names,

Fine.

just wait.

If you can't wait anymore,

just have these two send a message.

496

00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:00,760
planning to get rid of us?

Are we really going to wait here

until the end?

500
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:08,110
Yes.

The sky is getting dark.

If it really doesn't work,

503
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:45,310
we might as well go back
to Mingke House.

504
00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:48,040
There, at least,

505
00:22:48,430 --> 00:22:49,110
it's a place

506
00:22:49,110 --> 00:22:51,040
to shelter from the wind and rain.

507
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:53,280
I absolutely won't go back.

508
00:22:54,710 --> 00:22:55,640
You can't be thinking

509
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:57,000
of staying here overnight?

a sister like you?

514

If you're not leaving, I will.

Now she's still outside the yamen.

520
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:01,680
Then let her come in.

521
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
She can stay in the side courtyard.

522
00:24:03,470 --> 00:24:04,800
I can't believe you thought of that.

523
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:06,400

is still part of the county yamen.

for staying here?

at the county yamen for a while?

530
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:20,470

Others won't.

00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:33,400
The constables

576
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:34,230
usually have a hard time

577
00:26:34,230 --> 00:26:35,160
accessing large mansions.

578
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:36,560
The midwives at the office of punishment

579
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:37,680
can't investigate cases.

580
00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:39,400
You have a sharp mind

581
00:26:39,950 --> 00:26:41,400
and a talent for reading people

582
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,560
better than most.

583
00:26:43,110 --> 00:26:44,430
If you really want to help,

584
00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:46,640
I wouldn't refuse.

585
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:48,920
I'd be glad to help.

586
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:50,950
You

587
00:26:51,590 --> 00:26:52,950
always find trouble for yourself.

588
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:57,350
You two, get up now.

589
00:27:00,710 --> 00:27:01,640
Be careful.

590
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,000
Then, Meiqing,

591
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,070
please arrange for the two ladies.

592
00:27:20,110 --> 00:27:20,950
You two,

593
00:27:22,430 --> 00:27:23,230
follow me.

594
00:27:25,190 --> 00:27:25,950
Let's go.

595
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,640
In the end, it wasn't in vain to kneel.

596
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:42,430
I really underestimated you before.

597
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:43,950
You've got quite the clever mind.

598
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:46,520
You're staying in the yamen now.

599
00:27:59,110 --> 00:27:59,710
You two

600
00:27:59,710 --> 00:28:00,830
can live here for now.

601
00:28:01,070 --> 00:28:02,190
Who is it? Who is it?

602
00:28:02,190 --> 00:28:03,230
At this late hour,

603
00:28:03,230 --> 00:28:04,920
can't anyone sleep?

604
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:07,830
Mr. Chen.

605
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:11,830
Mr. Chen.

606
00:28:11,830 --> 00:28:12,640
It's so late.

607
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:13,640
What

608
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:14,710
brings you here?

609
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:16,760
This is the county's midwife.

610
00:28:16,950 --> 00:28:17,760
Ms. Sun,

611
00:28:17,830 --> 00:28:19,160
please help these two ladies

612
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:20,040
settle in.

613
00:28:20,350 --> 00:28:21,280
Don't worry.

614
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:22,710
I'll take care of it.

615
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:26,800
Take care, Mr. Chen.

616
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:35,070
You two are the courtesans

617
00:28:35,070 --> 00:28:36,920
from Mingke House, right?

618
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:39,310
Thanks for your help, Ms. Sun.

619
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:45,310
This room

620
00:28:45,310 --> 00:28:46,880
hasn't been lived in for a while.

621
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,160
You'll have to clean it up.

622
00:28:48,470 --> 00:28:50,000
Didn't Mr. Chen ask you

623
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:50,920
to help us clean up?

624
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:52,310
This isn't Mingke House.

625
00:28:52,430 --> 00:28:53,880
No one is here to serve you.

626
00:28:54,430 --> 00:28:55,920
It's not a big deal.

627
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:57,280
What are you talking about?

628
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:57,950
What?

629
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,400
Did I say something wrong?

630
00:28:59,590 --> 00:29:01,110
Thanks for the guidance.

631
00:29:02,230 --> 00:29:03,950
At least you have some sense.

632
00:29:10,190 --> 00:29:11,110
Let's go inside.

633
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,560
What a dump!

634
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:26,070
Is this fit for living?

635
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:27,800
It's okay.

636
00:29:28,190 --> 00:29:29,400
It's a bit messy,

637
00:29:29,470 --> 00:29:31,040
but we can clean it up.

638
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:33,160
You always said outside

639
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:34,830
was absolutely great.

640
00:29:35,110 --> 00:29:35,950
So I decided

641
00:29:35,950 --> 00:29:37,280
to go out with you.

642
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:38,430
If we have to live like this

643
00:29:38,430 --> 00:29:40,110
all the time,

644
00:29:40,110 --> 00:29:40,760
what

645
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,590
will I do?

646
00:29:44,230 --> 00:29:46,000
We're just staying here temporarily.

647
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:47,760
Once we get the removal papers,

648
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:49,760
we can leave whenever we want.

649
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:05,710
Bug! Bug!

650
00:30:05,710 --> 00:30:06,400
What's wrong?

651
00:30:07,830 --> 00:30:09,160
This one must be dead.

652
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:24,430
You take a break.

653
00:30:24,430 --> 00:30:25,430
I can handle it myself.

654
00:30:25,430 --> 00:30:26,760
We're supposed to live together.

655
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:29,950
Why should you do all the work alone?

656
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:40,710
You two, here.

657
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:42,190
Thanks!

658
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:45,470
You old hag.

659
00:30:45,590 --> 00:30:47,310
Just let it go; don't argue with her.

660
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:51,430
You're such a fool.

661
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:53,520
She's just trying to humiliate us.

662
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:56,350
Let her do what she wants.

663
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:57,830
If we don't take it to heart,

664
00:30:57,830 --> 00:30:59,310
she can't get to us.

665
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:02,560
Come on.

666
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:03,680
Help me out here.

667
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:07,820
[Linfen Yamen]

668
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:13,680
It's on fire!

669
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:15,040
Are you

670
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:16,000
cooking

671
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,430
or setting the place on fire?

672
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:19,190
I was just

673
00:31:19,310 --> 00:31:20,520
cooking

674
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:21,920
and accidentally fell asleep.

675
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:23,680
That's a lot of smoke!

676
00:31:25,110 --> 00:31:26,400
Yeah, it is a bit smoky,

677
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:28,000
but it's not on fire.

678
00:31:28,590 --> 00:31:29,920
What else can you do?

679
00:31:31,310 --> 00:31:31,950
Don't get mad.

680
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:48,110
You must be

681
00:31:48,110 --> 00:31:49,590
the pretty girls my brother mentioned.

682
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:51,830
Your brother?

683
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:54,070
My brother is Captain Cai.

684
00:31:54,070 --> 00:31:55,350
I'm the cook at the yamen.

685
00:31:55,350 --> 00:31:56,310
They call me Baozi.

686
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:57,350
Baozi?

687
00:31:58,040 --> 00:31:59,110
Is that your real name?

688
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:01,950
My last name is Cai, first name Baozi.

689
00:32:01,950 --> 00:32:02,950
Cai Baozi.

690
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:05,470
So, do you have

691
00:32:05,470 --> 00:32:07,000
meat buns in this kitchen?

692
00:32:11,310 --> 00:32:12,110
You two haven't eaten

693
00:32:12,110 --> 00:32:12,950
since last night, right?

694
00:32:14,470 --> 00:32:15,190
Just wait a moment.

695
00:32:24,590 --> 00:32:25,640
These are the pancakes I just made.

696
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:26,350
They're still warm.

697
00:32:26,350 --> 00:32:27,160
Give them a try.

698
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:32,190
They might be a bit burnt,

699
00:32:32,190 --> 00:32:33,640
but just peel it off.

700
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,190
I'm starving right now.

701
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:43,190
Tasty?

702
00:32:46,470 --> 00:32:47,760
So good!

703
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:59,190
Mr. Chen.

704
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:03,920
Where did you get that outfit?

705
00:33:04,310 --> 00:33:05,110
I borrowed some old clothes

706
00:33:05,110 --> 00:33:06,230
from Captain Cai.

707
00:33:06,430 --> 00:33:07,230
That's nonsense!

708
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:08,430
How could he

709
00:33:08,430 --> 00:33:09,710
just give the official uniform to you?

710
00:33:10,230 --> 00:33:11,230
Don't blame him.

711
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:12,680
I thought

712
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,230
if I dressed as a woman

713
00:33:14,230 --> 00:33:15,920
and moved around the county yamen,

714
00:33:15,950 --> 00:33:17,400
there might be some gossip.

715
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:19,040
But this outfit isn't right.

716
00:33:19,350 --> 00:33:20,230
I think it looks good.

717
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:24,040
It's also convenient for doing things.

718
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:25,710
Your Honor.

719
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:28,310
Why are you here so early?

720
00:33:29,350 --> 00:33:30,950
Our diligent county magistrate

721
00:33:30,950 --> 00:33:32,400
comes an hour early every day

722
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:33,520
to handle official business.

723
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:35,190
While others wake up with roosters,

724
00:33:35,190 --> 00:33:37,160
he's the one waking us up here.

725
00:33:40,230 --> 00:33:40,920
Is this how you

726
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:42,070
talk to your superior?

727
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:43,310
It's just because

728
00:33:43,310 --> 00:33:44,470
you're my classmate.

729
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:47,310
Meiqing,

730
00:33:47,710 --> 00:33:48,640
find a fitting outfit

731
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:49,640
for Miss Luo.

732
00:33:51,430 --> 00:33:52,160
You really let her

733
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:53,230
stay here to work?

734
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:56,800
I know.

735
00:33:56,950 --> 00:33:58,280
I'll find her one shortly.

736
00:34:01,070 --> 00:34:02,160
Thanks, Your Honor.

737
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:05,000
I have something to tell you.

738
00:34:05,310 --> 00:34:06,110
Go ahead.

739
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:08,430
Now that I've left Mingke House,

740
00:34:08,710 --> 00:34:10,670
I want to say goodbye to the past.

741
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:14,120
Please give me a new name, Your Honor.

742
00:34:16,950 --> 00:34:17,560
How about we drop

743
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:19,230
the "Xiang" from your name

744
00:34:19,670 --> 00:34:21,230
and call you Luo Shu?

745
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:25,600
Thank you, Your Honor.

746
00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:31,430
Find a fitting outfit.

747
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:38,950
Is there anything else?

748
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:41,150
Mr. Chen,

749
00:34:41,710 --> 00:34:42,870
is there anything

750
00:34:42,870 --> 00:34:44,430
I can do here?

751
00:34:44,670 --> 00:34:46,230
I can handle tough jobs.

752
00:34:46,230 --> 00:34:47,000
You're not

753
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:48,870
up to something again, are you?

754
00:34:50,470 --> 00:34:51,280
I admit

755
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:53,630
I did play a few tricks

756
00:34:53,870 --> 00:34:55,710
to break free from my low status.

757
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:56,950
But that was just self-preservation;

758
00:34:56,950 --> 00:34:58,150
I had no choice.

759
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:00,520
From now on, I'll have no secrets,

760
00:35:01,430 --> 00:35:02,950
just to do my bit

761
00:35:02,950 --> 00:35:04,040
to repay the magistrate.

762
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:06,630
I'll believe you this once.

763
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:09,360
I do have something for you to do.

764
00:35:09,630 --> 00:35:10,630
The list of detained prisoners

765
00:35:10,630 --> 00:35:11,760
and their files are still unorganized.

766
00:35:11,910 --> 00:35:12,870
It's not complicated,

767
00:35:12,870 --> 00:35:13,600
but it does require attention.

768
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:14,430
Can you handle it?

769
00:35:15,470 --> 00:35:16,800
If I make a single mistake,

770
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:17,910
I'm willing to be punished.

771
00:35:18,910 --> 00:35:19,950
Come get your clothes with me.

772
00:35:47,710 --> 00:35:48,670
Someone!

773
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:50,910
Why are you arresting me?

774
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:52,870
What's the reason?

775
00:35:52,870 --> 00:35:53,950
What have I done wrong?

776
00:35:54,430 --> 00:35:56,080
You can't just throw me in jail

777
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:56,870
without questioning me.

778
00:35:56,910 --> 00:35:58,230
You're disrespecting the law!

779
00:35:58,800 --> 00:35:59,870
Let me out!

780
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:01,800
Someone, let me...!

781
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:04,040
Young Master!

782
00:36:04,470 --> 00:36:05,910
I can't stop you from yelling,

783
00:36:05,910 --> 00:36:07,230
but at least drink some rice soup

784
00:36:07,230 --> 00:36:08,120
to soothe your throat.

785
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:13,320
What is this?

786
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:14,360
It smells so earthy.

787
00:36:15,230 --> 00:36:16,120
Hey, anyone there?

788
00:36:16,190 --> 00:36:18,320
Where are the prison guards?
The jailers?

789
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:19,710
Is everyone dead?

790
00:36:19,950 --> 00:36:21,320
Hurry up! Someone!

791
00:36:21,710 --> 00:36:23,040
I want to see the magistrate!

792
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:23,800
Hurry!

793
00:36:24,710 --> 00:36:25,710
Someone!

794
00:36:26,670 --> 00:36:29,280
You're new here.

795
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:31,280
Yeah, I'm new.

796
00:36:33,910 --> 00:36:36,150
You're from Linfen too.

797
00:36:36,390 --> 00:36:37,120
That's right.

798
00:36:39,390 --> 00:36:40,230
If you

799
00:36:40,470 --> 00:36:42,560
need anything from me,

800
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:43,710
just let me know.

801
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:45,630
Thanks!

802
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:47,800
How many prisoners are here?

803
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:48,950
Someone!

804
00:36:51,190 --> 00:36:52,360
Let me out!

805
00:36:53,230 --> 00:36:56,190
Let me out!

806
00:36:56,430 --> 00:36:59,150
All the registered prisoners are here.

807
00:36:59,470 --> 00:37:01,600
If you want to check anything,

808
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:02,670
just feel free.

809
00:37:03,910 --> 00:37:05,190
Thanks, Mr. Wei.

810
00:37:05,190 --> 00:37:06,190
No problem.

811
00:37:10,430 --> 00:37:11,120
You!

812
00:37:12,470 --> 00:37:13,280
Let me out!

813
00:37:14,630 --> 00:37:15,600
Go ahead and shout.

814
00:37:15,910 --> 00:37:17,600
No matter how much you say,

815
00:37:17,630 --> 00:37:19,320
I'll still outbid you by one liang.

816
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:20,470
Five hundred and one liang!

817
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:21,950
You have

818
00:37:21,950 --> 00:37:22,870
no reason

819
00:37:22,870 --> 00:37:23,710
to arrest us.

820
00:37:24,190 --> 00:37:25,390
It's not too late

821
00:37:25,390 --> 00:37:26,600
to let us go now.

822
00:37:27,150 --> 00:37:27,870
Whether it's reasonable or not

823
00:37:27,870 --> 00:37:28,910
is not up to you.

824
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:30,760
It's not up to me.

825
00:37:31,390 --> 00:37:32,150
You get to decide?

826
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:35,150
Do you know who my dad is?

827
00:37:35,230 --> 00:37:36,120
You said it's not up to me.

828
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:45,080
Do you know who my dad is?

829
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:49,360
Who's your dad?

830
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:50,120
I don't know.

831
00:37:51,230 --> 00:37:52,040
What a coincidence!

832
00:37:52,430 --> 00:37:54,040
I don't know who your dad is either.

833
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:54,630
You!

834
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:58,760
Fine, it's okay if you don't know.

835
00:37:58,760 --> 00:37:59,710
Let me tell you.

836
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,230
I'm the little son

837
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:05,520
of Governor Qi,

838
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:06,950
Qi Menglin.

839
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:10,950
So you're Governor Qi's son?

840
00:38:10,950 --> 00:38:12,280
I'm so sorry!

841
00:38:12,430 --> 00:38:14,120
We really didn't recognize you.

842
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:14,760
How could we

843
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:15,950
lock you up in here?

844
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:18,390
It's fine.

845
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:19,840
I won't hold a grudge.

846
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:20,560
Hurry up,

847
00:38:20,950 --> 00:38:21,870
let us out.

848
00:38:23,910 --> 00:38:26,120
But I'm just a low-ranking guy.

849
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:26,950
I can't decide.

850
00:38:27,470 --> 00:38:28,190
I never said

851
00:38:28,190 --> 00:38:29,670
to just let me out right away.

852
00:38:29,670 --> 00:38:30,870
I won't make things difficult for you.

853
00:38:30,870 --> 00:38:32,600
Go find your magistrate.

854
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:35,390
Tell him to come here
and get me himself.

855
00:38:35,910 --> 00:38:36,710
Oh right,

856
00:38:37,150 --> 00:38:38,230
make sure to mention my name.

857
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:40,710
Got it! I'll remember.

858
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:47,000
With your high status,

859
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:48,710
you must not be used

860
00:38:48,710 --> 00:38:49,950
to this jail food.

861
00:38:51,390 --> 00:38:52,390
Is this even food?

862
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:53,360
I thought

863
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:54,840
you brought slop.

864
00:38:55,630 --> 00:38:56,760
It's our fault.

865
00:38:57,190 --> 00:38:58,560
I'll go get you

866
00:38:58,560 --> 00:38:59,870
some good food.

867
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,520
I can't let you go hungry.

868
00:39:02,190 --> 00:39:02,840
You

869
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:04,320
have some good sense.

870
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:07,320
You've earned it.

871
00:39:07,870 --> 00:39:10,000
Get as much food as you can.

872
00:39:10,230 --> 00:39:12,230
Whatever's left is yours.

873
00:39:16,430 --> 00:39:17,710
You're really generous.

874
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:19,080
Thanks for the reward!

875
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:20,040
No problem!

876
00:39:20,230 --> 00:39:21,040
Wait a minute.

877
00:39:22,630 --> 00:39:23,320
Uh,

878
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:26,320
bring back some meat.

879
00:39:27,190 --> 00:39:28,950
Don't worry; I'll get right on it.

880
00:39:28,950 --> 00:39:29,630
Go on.

881
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:35,670
Why aren't you
eating your rice porridge?

882
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,520
We'll have meat soon.

883
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:39,120
We'll have meat soon.

884
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:40,280
Money doesn't matter now?

885
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:42,430
Bro.

886
00:39:42,670 --> 00:39:44,000
Your dad is really the governor?

887
00:39:44,710 --> 00:39:46,000
Of course!

888
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:46,910
Absolutely!

889
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:49,710
Wait.

890
00:39:49,710 --> 00:39:50,710
What are you doing?

891
00:39:51,870 --> 00:39:52,840
Please, please!

892
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:53,870
Help me, help me!

893
00:39:53,870 --> 00:39:54,630
Wait.

894
00:39:54,710 --> 00:39:56,190
Why are you bowing?

895
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:58,320
Help me check my case!

896
00:39:58,630 --> 00:39:59,600
I'm innocent!

897
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:00,560
I don't want to die!

898
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:01,670
Don't believe him.

899
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:02,800
Young Master,

900
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,800
people like this are desperate.

901
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:06,390
They don't blink

902
00:40:06,390 --> 00:40:07,630
when they do bad things.

903
00:40:07,910 --> 00:40:09,430
Now they want to live.

904
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:11,430
I'm not like them!

905
00:40:11,430 --> 00:40:12,870
I'm really innocent!

906
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:14,520
The former magistrate

907
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:16,080
framed me for murder.

908
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:17,360
Now there's a new magistrate,

909
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:18,470
but no one listens to me.

910
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:20,390
I'm really out of options here.

911
00:40:20,390 --> 00:40:21,800
Please, be a hero;

912
00:40:22,190 --> 00:40:23,000
help me out!

913
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,520
I'm begging you, I'm begging you!

914
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:27,360
Be a hero.

915
00:40:29,190 --> 00:40:29,910
Alright.

916
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:31,760
Tell me your story

917
00:40:31,950 --> 00:40:32,630
honestly.

918
00:40:33,950 --> 00:40:34,670
Here's the thing:

919
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:35,600
just a few days ago,

920
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:36,800
I went to my friend's house

921
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:38,230
to deliver water,

922
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:39,710
and they suddenly grabbed me.

923
00:40:39,710 --> 00:40:41,120
He was fine when I went,

924
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:41,760
but the next day, he was dead.

925
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:43,040
I had nothing to do with it.

926
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:43,710
Then the former magistrate....!

927
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:54,150
What a scoundrel!

928
00:40:54,150 --> 00:40:54,910
Don't worry.

929
00:40:54,950 --> 00:40:55,910
Once I get out,

930
00:40:55,910 --> 00:40:57,230
I'll get you justice.

931
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:59,080
Thank you, thank you!

932
00:40:59,080 --> 00:40:59,840
Thanks!

933
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:03,190
Just in time, food's here!

934
00:41:03,190 --> 00:41:03,950
Let's eat together.

935
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:07,430
Sorry to keep you waiting.

936
00:41:07,910 --> 00:41:09,430
No worries, good food is worth the wait.

937
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:22,430
What do you mean?

938
00:41:23,710 --> 00:41:25,080
You don't need to thank me.

939
00:41:25,190 --> 00:41:26,430
I'm helping you out.

940
00:41:26,630 --> 00:41:28,320
I don't want you
to get into more trouble.

941
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:29,710
You got arrested

942
00:41:29,710 --> 00:41:30,870
for upsetting the magistrate.

943
00:41:31,190 --> 00:41:32,360
If there's another charge,

944
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:33,840
like bribing me,

945
00:41:34,150 --> 00:41:35,280
you might end up in here

946
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:37,040
for a few extra months.

947
00:41:37,230 --> 00:41:38,230
You're playing me.

948
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:40,080
You dare use the governor's name

949
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:41,320
to swindle me.

950
00:41:41,670 --> 00:41:43,280
I'm just messing with you.

951
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:44,950
I've been pretty lenient.

952
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:45,950
You're something.

953
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:47,360
I'll remember your face,

954
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:49,040
you sissy!

955
00:41:51,630 --> 00:41:53,000
Who are you calling sissy?

956
00:41:58,150 --> 00:41:59,470
I'm talking about you. What's up?

957
00:42:00,670 --> 00:42:01,470
Really?

958
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:02,670
Guess you've never

959
00:42:02,670 --> 00:42:04,120
looked in the mirror.

960
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:07,280
The Linfen yamen

961
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:08,320
is rotten to the core.

962
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:09,280
There's not a decent person in sight.

963
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:10,870
The magistrate is abducting women;

964
00:42:10,870 --> 00:42:12,520
the clerks are sly and crafty.

965
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:14,710
If you frame me, so be it.

966
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:15,950
But this man next door

967
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:17,230
is almost framed to death.

968
00:42:17,230 --> 00:42:18,280
If he really dies unjustly,

969
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:19,520
may heaven strike you down.

970
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:20,870
Strike you down!

971
00:42:26,910 --> 00:42:28,120
You have grievances?

972
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:32,870
You're just a lowly clerk.

973
00:42:33,670 --> 00:42:35,040
What can you do about it?

974
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:38,230
What's your name?

975
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:40,080
