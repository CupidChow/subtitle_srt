[Adapted from the novel
"Jin Nang" by Shui He]

3
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:33,020
[Episode 34]

4
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,590
I've checked

5
00:01:34,910 --> 00:01:35,950
all the temples he visited,

6
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:36,680
and the martial sects

7
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:37,950
he interacted with.

8
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:39,830
But there's still no trace of him.

9
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:42,000
A person can't just

10
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,400
disappear into thin air.

11
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:45,480
Does he have

12
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:46,590
any favorite sayings

13
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,230
or habits?

14
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:50,080
Sayings or habits...

15
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,510
He often quotes a line of poetry.

16
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:59,000
"I come to seek the Dao,
with no more to say,

17
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:01,400
Clouds in the blue sky,
water in the vase."

18
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:03,720
"I come to seek the Dao,
with no more to say,

19
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:07,270
Clouds in the blue sky,
water in the vase."

20
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:08,110
Exactly.

21
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:11,520
Recently,

22
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:13,110
it seems he's taken a liking

23
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:14,390
to collecting stone statues.

24
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:16,910
There are those of Laozi,

25
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:18,030
as well as Buddha statues.

26
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:19,470
Isn't he a follower of Daoism?

27
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:21,240
Why would he collect Buddha statues?

28
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,830
Well, I don't know about that.

29
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:33,270
"Clouds in the blue sky,
water in the vase."

30
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:36,190
Buddha statues...

31
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,240
Tianlong Mountain.

32
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:42,270
Tianlong Mountain?

33
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:44,960
It is a famous Buddhist mountain.

34
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:47,440
There are many grotto sculptures.

35
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,630
Next to it, there's a Daoist mountain

36
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:52,080
called Longshan.

37
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,630
No wonder we can't find him.

38
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,470
Turns out he's hiding

39
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:57,080
in the Buddhist mountain.

40
00:02:58,670 --> 00:02:59,630
This whole thing

41
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:02,520
is a trap set by Mr. Liu and Qin Yi

42
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,160
against the Qi family.

43
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,600
Initially, Qin Yi advised me

44
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:08,360
to burn

45
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:10,080
the relief grain managed by Mr. Liu,

46
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,960
making him unable to escape blame.

47
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,800
This way, we can take him down.

48
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:16,160
I had my doubts about Qin Yi,

49
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:17,910
but at that time,

50
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:20,160
Father was under heavy pressure
from the court.

51
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:21,880
The Qi family needed this opportunity

52
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:22,910
to turn things around.

53
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:24,960
After discussing with Father,

54
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,880
I decided to go along with the plan.

55
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:28,670
But unexpectedly,

56
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:31,110
the relief grain was merely

57
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:32,550
their diversionary tactic.

58
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:34,270
Their real goal

59
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,600
was to make you secretly divert
two ships of military grain,

60
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,160
and then burn down the granary.

61
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,830
When Father arrived,

62
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,190
it was too late.

63
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:44,000
And those two ships of grain

64
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:46,240
were replaced with rice husks.

65
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,000
Liu Yiqing's faction

66
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,360
reported to the court against Father,

67
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:51,550
accusing him of embezzling

68
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:52,600
military grain

69
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:53,960
and deliberately setting fire
to the granary

70
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:56,320
to cover up his crimes.

71
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:57,880
We found out

72
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,880
the granary officer on duty that day

73
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,270
was likely bribed.

74
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:04,910
And it's not just the granary officer
who was bribed.

75
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:07,520
The one who truly dealt

76
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,910
a fatal blow to the Qi family

77
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:10,320
was Lian Qi.

78
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,470
Lian Qi?

79
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:13,600
It really was him.

80
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,390
That day in Father's study,

81
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:17,480
I forged the grain requisition document,

82
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,670
and ran into him when I came out.

83
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:19,670
I thought

84
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:20,550
you had sent him

85
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:21,550
to keep an eye on me.

86
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:27,550
That day,

87
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:30,760
I was worried
you would go to see Miss Luo,

88
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:32,320
so I had him watch you.

89
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:35,320
I never expected

90
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:39,480
he would burn down the granary.

91
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,350
But, Yanjin,

92
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:42,110
he has followed you for so many years.

93
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:42,760
How could he...

94
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,670
That's the terrifying thing
about Qin Yi.

95
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:47,200
He had long ago placed this pawn

96
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,480
within the Qi family.

97
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:56,200
Yanjin,

98
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,350
there's an old matter
from over a decade ago.

99
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:00,670
This time,

100
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:01,790
I hope you will tell me the truth.

101
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:03,320
I know what you want to ask.

102
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:13,110
The fire at Luo's residence

103
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,880
was indeed related to the Qi family.

104
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:20,270
You're not surprised?

105
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:22,880
I suppose Qin Yi has already told you

106
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:23,720
something.

107
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:25,320
Right?

108
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:27,270
I won't easily trust his words.

109
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:29,350
I only believe my own judgment.

110
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:30,670
Over a decade ago,

111
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,510
when Father was in Taiyuan

112
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:33,550
as a command official,

113
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:34,670
he got to know the Qin family.

114
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,920
He began to exploit his position

115
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,920
to collude with the Qin family
in selling government grain.

116
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,510
Gradually, he amassed wealth.

117
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:43,670
But who would have known

118
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:44,920
this would be discovered

119
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:47,000
by a minor official
in charge of the granary?

120
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:49,480
That person was my father.

121
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:53,110
Your father was too straightforward.

122
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,040
He even tried to write a letter
to report it.

123
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:57,070
But this letter ended up

124
00:05:57,790 --> 00:05:59,720
in the hands of someone
working for my father.

125
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,160
After all, he's just a small fry.

126
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:05,950
Just give him some money
to keep him quiet

127
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:08,070
and send him far away.

128
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:10,350
One must not be too merciful.

129
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:12,670
Taiyuan is our territory.

130
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,270
We cannot allow

131
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:16,480
such dangerous people to exist.

132
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:23,230
Only the dead will keep silent.

133
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:26,670
Governor Qi,

134
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,440
Qin Yi, my adopted son,

135
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:29,920
is right.

136
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:32,670
After all, those are lives at stake.

137
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:35,200
Leave this to me.

138
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,200
It'll get done flawlessly.

139
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:32,070
Even though I've known him
for many years,

140
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:34,350
I never expected him to be so ruthless

141
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:35,950
from such a young age.

142
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:37,200
Indeed.

143
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:41,510
At that time, he was only...

144
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:42,950
Fourteen.

145
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:46,920
He was using this opportunity

146
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:49,160
to completely gain the trust of Mr. Qin.

147
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,270
A year after your family's incident,

148
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:53,160
my father was promoted to the capital.

149
00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:55,070
We also moved our entire family.

150
00:07:55,230 --> 00:07:56,920
But our properties in Shanxi

151
00:07:57,070 --> 00:07:58,510
and the relationship with the Qin family

152
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,160
needed someone to manage.

153
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:02,000
Father had me stay behind,

154
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:05,110
claiming I was focused
on cultivating my Dao

155
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:06,720
and took a master in Shanxi.

156
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:08,550
At this time, Qin Yi

157
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:11,070
had already become Mr. Qin's confidant.

158
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,440
I was in close contact with him,

159
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:15,160
and I understood

160
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,600
his character and nature,

161
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,670
his ambitions and methods.

162
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,160
Not long after that,

163
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:23,510
Mr. Qin suddenly died.

164
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,110
His death was very suspicious.

165
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:28,550
And Qin Yi became

166
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:29,760
the head of the Qin family.

167
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,440
Then what happened?

168
00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:33,640
Later, his ambitions grew larger.

169
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:34,520
In order to expand,

170
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:36,200
he dared to dabble in any business.

171
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:37,230
In recent years,

172
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:39,640
he has also violated
the court's prohibitions,

173
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:41,760
secretly selling salt and iron
beyond the pass.

174
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:44,230
My father ordered me
to repeatedly advise him,

175
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:47,280
but he feigned compliance.

176
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:48,710
If this went on,

177
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:50,440
it would surely lead to disaster.

178
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:52,200
Father told me

179
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:54,000
to cut ties with the Qin family.

180
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:57,150
Unexpectedly, this also provoked Qin Yi,

181
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,350
leading him to ally with Mr. Liu.

182
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:01,520
Thus began

183
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,030
the plot to frame the Qi family.

184
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:09,520
I've said everything I should

185
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,000
and everything I can.

186
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:15,710
You kept talking about the Qi family,

187
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:17,350
but what about the Luo family?

188
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:19,840
Where are they in all this?

189
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,640
Just because they are commoners,

190
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:23,030
they can be disregarded?

191
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:25,150
They are people,

192
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,320
just like the nobility,

193
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,320
living, breathing humans.

194
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,110
Yanjin,

195
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:30,320
over the years,

196
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:31,470
how many innocent lives

197
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:32,760
have been sacrificed?

198
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:34,710
You colluded
with officials and merchants,

199
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:35,590
lining your own pockets,

200
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:36,760
at their expense.

201
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,150
Now you turned against each other,

202
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:38,710
fighting endlessly,

203
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:40,000
and still, they are the ones who suffer.

204
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:41,400
Why, Yanjin?

205
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,110
Let's go.

206
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:45,640
Menglin,

207
00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:50,080
you and Miss Luo

208
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:53,150
should go to a place unknown to anyone,

209
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,960
and live the life you desire.

210
00:09:56,790 --> 00:09:57,710
But I cannot.

211
00:09:58,590 --> 00:09:59,710
The matters of the Qi family

212
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:01,670
still need me.

213
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,470
You can go with peace of mind.

214
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:06,840
For the sake of the Qi family,

215
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:09,960
leave behind
a continuation of our lineage.

216
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:17,790
Let's go.

217
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Luo Shu, I'm sorry.

218
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:41,110
You should leave.

219
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,230
Where do you want me to go

220
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:45,670
when you're here?

221
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,200
I don't want you to get involved

222
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:52,200
in the Qi family's troubles anymore.

223
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,350
But I'm a member of the Qi family.

224
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,230
It is in trouble now.

225
00:10:58,230 --> 00:10:59,470
I can't just stand by.

226
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:03,280
We are already bound by life and death.

227
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:04,670
Our fates are connected.

228
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,960
How can we distinguish
between you and me?

229
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,320
The Qi family was indeed involved

230
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,030
in the fire incident back then.

231
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:12,910
But the mastermind was the Qin family,

232
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:14,590
and it was Qin Yi who acted.

233
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:17,520
Why should you take the blame for them?

234
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:18,590
Why should you endure

235
00:11:18,590 --> 00:11:20,110
punishments that do not belong to you?

236
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,200
Since your enemy now

237
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,200
is also Qin Yi,

238
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,000
let's join forces

239
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,520
to seek justice together

240
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:27,110
and reveal the truth.

241
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:34,670
Yanjin.

242
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,470
Luo Shu and I have decided to stay.

243
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:47,960
Miss Luo,

244
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:50,080
the past

245
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,440
cannot be changed.

246
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:52,760
If there is a chance,

247
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,320
the Qi family will make amends.

248
00:11:57,790 --> 00:11:58,590
Mr. Yanjin,

249
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,590
let's talk about the past later.

250
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:02,640
What we need to do now is to find out

251
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,080
where the military grain has gone.

252
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,030
As long as we find it,

253
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,960
the charges
against the Qi family by Mr. Liu

254
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,110
will collapse on their own.

255
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:12,590
Alright.

256
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,280
Let's discuss

257
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:15,640
the matter of the ten carts of grain.

258
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,520
The grain

259
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:20,080
must have been loaded onto the ships.

260
00:12:20,590 --> 00:12:22,350
But when it reached the Linfen Dock,

261
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:23,230
in plain view,

262
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:24,470
it all turned into rice husks.

263
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:26,400
There is only one possibility:

264
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:28,520
the grain was switched

265
00:12:28,590 --> 00:12:29,590
during the journey.

266
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,080
I think so too.

267
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:33,670
From Taiyuan to Linfen,

268
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:34,960
there are several ports along the way.

269
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,280
Let's start investigating
from these ports.

270
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,440
We will surely find clues.

271
00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:41,880
Menglin, you may not know,

272
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,520
there are over ten ports

273
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:46,080
along the way

274
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,080
from Taiyuan to Linfen.

275
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:48,280
But right now,

276
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:49,710
Qin Yi will definitely find ways

277
00:12:49,710 --> 00:12:50,400
to search for us.

278
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:51,880
We have no chance

279
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,470
to search for the grain at every port.

280
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:55,150
Think carefully.

281
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:57,400
Did you sleep on the ship?

282
00:12:57,470 --> 00:12:59,030
When did you fall asleep,
and when did you wake up?

283
00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:14,790
The moon was facing east,

284
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:16,400
so it was a waning crescent.

285
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:18,760
It must be after midnight.

286
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:19,960
I remember

287
00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:22,440
standing at the bow of the ship,

288
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:23,640
I was full of worries,

289
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:25,470
thinking about getting to Linfen quickly

290
00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:26,760
to distribute grain to the people.

291
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,150
But suddenly,

292
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:32,080
my eyes felt sore and hard to open.

293
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:33,710
I was extremely sleepy.

294
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:36,000
Later, I realized that even Lian Shu

295
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,350
was feeling the same way.

296
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:44,760
Tired? Let's rest for a bit.

297
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,710
They replaced the grain with rice husks.

298
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:56,000
Among the boatmen,

299
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,230
there must be someone from them.

300
00:13:57,710 --> 00:13:59,670
You suddenly felt your eyes sore,

301
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:02,400
hard to open, and extremely sleepy.

302
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:04,520
This must be
due to the torches being contaminated.

303
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,030
The torches being contaminated?

304
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:09,110
You mean sleep gas?

305
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,640
I've read about it in stories before.

306
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:13,960
But if it was sleep gas,

307
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,520
why were they unaffected?

308
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:16,590
My silly brother,

309
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:19,280
if they could pull off such a trick,

310
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:21,960
they must have taken
the antidote in advance.

311
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:23,590
Did you and Lian Shu

312
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:25,150
sleep all the way to Linfen?

313
00:14:25,150 --> 00:14:25,880
No.

314
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,550
I woke up just as dawn broke,

315
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:30,200
the eastern sky
just starting to lighten.

316
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:31,880
That was around Yin hour.

317
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:34,230
There were four hours in between.

318
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:36,030
I am familiar with the water route

319
00:14:36,030 --> 00:14:36,840
from Taiyuan to Linfen.

320
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:39,790
If you departed at Hai hour,

321
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:41,520
from Zi hour to Yin hour,

322
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:43,760
[Taoyuan Ferry  Yanming Ferry]
you'd pass through these three ports.

323
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:46,110
The largest of them

324
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:47,710
is called Luosha Port.

325
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:48,840
Luosha Port?

326
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,910
They must have switched the grain

327
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,440
within those four hours.

328
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,400
They would need to hire many people.

329
00:14:55,230 --> 00:14:56,230
And Luosha Port

330
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:58,080
has more people

331
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:58,910
than the other two ports.

332
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:01,880
Alright, let's go to Luosha Port

333
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:03,200
and find the grain.

334
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,280
With Qin Yi's caution,

335
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:07,840
how could he possibly

336
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,200
leave such a large clue

337
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,350
for us to find?

338
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:16,150
What if they weren't prepared?

339
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:18,200
Exactly.

340
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,280
Even if there's only a slim chance,

341
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:21,550
we have to strive for it.

342
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:23,710
Alright.

343
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:25,670
Let's head to Luosha Port.

344
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:30,200
Mr. Qi, they're here.

345
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,080
Go guard the gate.

346
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:04,150
Catch them!

347
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:04,960
Go!

348
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:06,760
Keep up!

349
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:17,550
Stop!

350
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:25,440
Go get the horses!

351
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:26,200
Yes!

352
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:26,840
Hurry!

353
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:34,110
Where are Luo Shu and Qi Menglin?

354
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:40,710
You will never find them.

355
00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:42,040
Really?

356
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:45,520
But I've found you.

357
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:48,350
With our years of friendship,

358
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:51,710
I can find you wherever you go.

359
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,760
They are the same.

360
00:17:56,800 --> 00:18:00,680
From Taiyuan to all of Shanxi,

361
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:02,830
I have my spies everywhere.

362
00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:07,000
Do you think

363
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:09,560
you can win?

364
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,160
The Qi family
has worked with you for years,

365
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,400
yet we still discarded you like trash.

366
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:16,190
What about Mr. Liu?

367
00:18:17,190 --> 00:18:18,640
How long has he known you?

368
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:21,310
Do you think

369
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:22,880
he will treat you sincerely?

370
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:23,800
On what grounds?

371
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:26,070
Just because you helped him

372
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:27,230
with some shady work

373
00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:28,400
and essentially sworn your loyalty?

374
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:30,800
Stop dreaming.

375
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:33,160
Liu Yiqing's ambition

376
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,470
far exceeds my father's.

377
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:36,040
His heart is even darker.

378
00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:38,710
At least the Qi family is willing

379
00:18:38,710 --> 00:18:39,880
to part ways amicably with you.

380
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:40,800
He...

381
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:43,560
wouldn't be so merciful.

382
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:45,760
Don't forget,

383
00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:47,760
you betrayed the Qi family

384
00:18:48,430 --> 00:18:49,590
to ally with him.

385
00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:51,470
Do you really believe

386
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,520
he would be foolish enough
to take a traitor

387
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:54,880
as his confidant?

388
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,310
Stop deceiving yourself.

389
00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:00,400
Yanjin,

390
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:05,710
you really have a kind heart.

391
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:07,830
Even now,

392
00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:10,470
you're still thinking of me
as your friend.

393
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,400
Your father, Qi Zongyue,
is being escorted to the capital,

394
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:14,950
and he faces certain death.

395
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,710
Shouldn't you spend more time

396
00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:18,070
thinking about him?

397
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,160
Well,

398
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,590
you've been on the run for so long.

399
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:25,040
You must be trying to buy time

400
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:27,190
for the Qi family to survive.

401
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,680
But I advise you to give up.

402
00:19:30,310 --> 00:19:31,640
You're daydreaming.

403
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:38,190
Governor Qi has always favored

404
00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:40,040
his two legitimate sons.

405
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,350
You're a mere illegitimate child.

406
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,040
What's the point?

407
00:19:46,430 --> 00:19:47,430
How about this?

408
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:48,760
Tell me

409
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:50,760
the whereabouts
of Luo Shu and Qi Menglin,

410
00:19:51,430 --> 00:19:53,110
and out of our years of friendship,

411
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:58,230
I might just give you a chance to live.

412
00:20:13,230 --> 00:20:14,590
Qin Yi,

413
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:18,110
you haven't made any progress at all.

414
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:20,520
We've known each other for years,

415
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:23,710
and you've always tried
to manipulate me with status.

416
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:24,680
Do you really think

417
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:26,160
I would fall for your tricks?

418
00:20:27,230 --> 00:20:28,310
Status is something

419
00:20:29,230 --> 00:20:30,520
you should care about the most.

420
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:31,400
Qi Yanjin.

421
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:33,350
As a man who relied on schemes

422
00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:35,110
to vie for favor among women,

423
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:36,040
how could you possibly understand

424
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:38,070
the bonds of father and son,
or brotherhood?

425
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:39,800
No wonder.

426
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:42,310
You were just a dog
who begged for scraps

427
00:20:42,310 --> 00:20:43,760
in front of Mr. Qin,

428
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,470
exploiting your appearance.

429
00:20:45,470 --> 00:20:47,160
Cut his tendons and ligaments!

430
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,070
How's that?

431
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:43,640
My methods are quite efficient,
aren't they?

432
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:48,710
My present is your future.

433
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:50,680
Qin Yi,

434
00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:53,000
what other ruthless moves do you have?

435
00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:55,350
Feel free to use them.

436
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:57,470
You're still so stubborn.

437
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:00,800
Are you willing to give up your tongue?

438
00:22:02,470 --> 00:22:03,280
Knife!

439
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:08,070
Brother,

440
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:12,000
give him a quick end.

441
00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:14,230
Brother?

442
00:22:16,430 --> 00:22:18,470
So you two are brothers?

443
00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:22,070
Mercy for the weak.

444
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:25,590
Lian Qi,

445
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:27,760
tell me,

446
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,880
who treats you better,

447
00:22:30,710 --> 00:22:32,190
me or Qin Yi?

448
00:22:39,470 --> 00:22:40,280
Brother,

449
00:22:41,430 --> 00:22:42,280
come here.

450
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:45,470
Come on.

451
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:50,710
Come here.

452
00:22:50,710 --> 00:22:51,230
No, brother.

453
00:22:51,230 --> 00:22:51,880
Come here.

454
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:53,520
Come with me.

455
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:53,950
Brother!

456
00:22:53,950 --> 00:22:55,000
Come with me!

457
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,110
I'm your real brother.

458
00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:04,520
I'm teaching you how to do things now.

459
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,640
Brother, stop it!

460
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:07,470
Just stop!

461
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:08,430
Stop!

462
00:23:09,950 --> 00:23:10,470
Stop...

463
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:22,560
Brother...

464
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:25,640
Stop it...

465
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:32,310
Stop!

466
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:36,000
You!

467
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:38,350
Even you have betrayed me!

468
00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:44,000
Karma!

469
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:46,040
This is karma!

470
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:47,830
Qin Yi,

471
00:23:48,710 --> 00:23:50,230
this betrayal

472
00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:52,230
comes so swiftly.

473
00:23:53,230 --> 00:23:54,920
A rat in the gutter

474
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:58,110
only deserves to live in the gutter.

475
00:23:58,880 --> 00:23:59,680
Qin Yi,

476
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:03,040
let me tell you,

477
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:07,000
of what I possess,

478
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:11,160
you can only dream in your lifetime.

479
00:24:12,430 --> 00:24:13,070
I, Qin Yi,

480
00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:14,470
can do whatever I want.

481
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:16,000
No one can stop me.

482
00:24:17,430 --> 00:24:19,430
Not even the Emperor!

483
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:55,470
Take this.

484
00:24:55,470 --> 00:24:55,880
Yanjin.

485
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:56,590
You'll need it later.

486
00:24:56,590 --> 00:24:57,190
What are you doing?

487
00:24:57,190 --> 00:24:58,350
Menglin, there's no time!

488
00:24:58,760 --> 00:24:59,590
We'll split up.

489
00:24:59,830 --> 00:25:01,520
You two go to Luosha Port
to find evidence.

490
00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:02,160
Yanjin!

491
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:02,920
Menglin!

492
00:25:03,350 --> 00:25:04,430
I have skills.

493
00:25:04,430 --> 00:25:05,280
It'll be fine.

494
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:06,830
Miss Luo,

495
00:25:07,190 --> 00:25:08,560
please take good care of Menglin.

496
00:25:08,950 --> 00:25:09,590
I will.

497
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:10,800
Go!

498
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:17,710
At this moment,

499
00:25:17,950 --> 00:25:19,190
we must not lose focus.

500
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:21,230
Qin Yi will not back down.

501
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,230
We must stay vigilant on our journey.

502
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:24,830
Only by finding the grain

503
00:25:24,830 --> 00:25:25,880
and gathering evidence

504
00:25:26,110 --> 00:25:27,400
can we honor your brother.

505
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:38,760
Excuse me,

506
00:25:39,230 --> 00:25:40,590
I'd like to ask you something.

507
00:25:42,430 --> 00:25:43,350
About ten days ago,

508
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:44,560
did you see

509
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:46,160
two ships unloading grain here?

510
00:25:46,430 --> 00:25:47,190
No.

511
00:25:47,190 --> 00:25:48,040
I don't know.

512
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:49,470
How could you not know?

513
00:25:49,470 --> 00:25:50,230
There must have been!

514
00:25:50,230 --> 00:25:51,040
Think again.

515
00:25:51,470 --> 00:25:53,230
This dock was recently renovated.

516
00:25:53,230 --> 00:25:54,470
No one was around for a month.

517
00:25:54,590 --> 00:25:56,280
Only a few days ago
did we start shipping again.

518
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,040
We haven't worked here for a long time.

519
00:25:59,830 --> 00:26:01,070
Who are you?

520
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:02,160
Why do you ask?

521
00:26:02,350 --> 00:26:03,760
We're in the trading business.

522
00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:04,710
We thought

523
00:26:04,710 --> 00:26:06,350
we could make a big profit here,

524
00:26:06,350 --> 00:26:07,830
but it seems we've been deceived.

525
00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:09,040
There's nothing here.

526
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:11,830
Sir, do you know

527
00:26:11,950 --> 00:26:13,230
if there are other docks around?

528
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:14,110
Yes.

529
00:26:14,350 --> 00:26:15,110
There are

530
00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:15,950
five or six docks here.

531
00:26:17,430 --> 00:26:18,310
Thank you.

532
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,040
So many docks,

533
00:26:24,230 --> 00:26:25,310
we'll have to search one by one.

534
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:27,070
I'm afraid Qin Yi will catch up.

535
00:26:27,190 --> 00:26:28,230
There's no time left.

536
00:26:29,070 --> 00:26:29,760
Hey!

537
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:30,830
Wait!

538
00:26:31,110 --> 00:26:32,350
Please wait.

539
00:26:32,950 --> 00:26:34,830
Are you here to buy grain?

540
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:37,680
How did you know?

541
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:39,230
Of course I know.

542
00:26:40,710 --> 00:26:41,590
But...

543
00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:43,160
Money isn't an issue,

544
00:26:43,470 --> 00:26:44,520
but how can you prove

545
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:45,950
your information is reliable?

546
00:26:45,950 --> 00:26:46,920
Don't try to deceive us.

547
00:26:46,950 --> 00:26:48,710
If I did, let me die a terrible death!

548
00:26:48,710 --> 00:26:49,710
May lightning strike me!

549
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:51,880
There are too many scammers nowadays.

550
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:52,560
We're leaving.

551
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:54,560
Who's trying to scam you?

552
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:55,800
You can't just leave without asking!

553
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:57,800
Those guys don't know anything.

554
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:58,880
How do you know?

555
00:26:59,070 --> 00:27:00,280
Of course I know.

556
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:01,190
My cousin...

557
00:27:03,950 --> 00:27:04,880
Without money,

558
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,800
I can't tell you.

559
00:27:12,470 --> 00:27:14,040
Tell me everything you know,

560
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,800
and this is all yours.

561
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:16,800
Deal.

562
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:18,400
If you want to buy grain,

563
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,710
go to Taoyuan Ferry.

564
00:27:19,710 --> 00:27:21,310
A large batch of grain
just arrived there.

565
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:22,680
Taoyuan Ferry?

566
00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:23,560
Yes.

567
00:27:23,950 --> 00:27:25,190
You can take the water route

568
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,280
to the small dock at Taoyuan Ferry.

569
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:28,880
It will take about an hour.

570
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:30,160
Are you serious?

571
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:30,920
Yes.

572
00:27:32,070 --> 00:27:33,590
Don't you just want

573
00:27:33,590 --> 00:27:34,590
to trade some grain

574
00:27:34,590 --> 00:27:35,560
and sell it at a high price.

575
00:27:35,830 --> 00:27:37,190
When you get to Taoyuan Ferry,

576
00:27:37,190 --> 00:27:38,760
look for my cousin, Zhitou.

577
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:39,710
He will guide you.

578
00:27:40,430 --> 00:27:41,040
When we get there,

579
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:42,280
how do we find your cousin?

580
00:27:42,590 --> 00:27:43,880
Taoyuan Ferry isn't big.

581
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:44,920
Everyone at the dock

582
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:45,710
knows him.

583
00:27:45,710 --> 00:27:46,880
He often works there.

584
00:27:51,230 --> 00:27:52,830
Money!

585
00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:54,430
Thank you.

586
00:28:01,830 --> 00:28:02,520
Let's go.

Place your bets.

589
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:19,590
Excuse me,

590
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:22,190
where can I find Zhitou?

591
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:24,350
Over there.

592
00:28:24,350 --> 00:28:26,190
The shortest one is him.

593
00:28:27,430 --> 00:28:28,310
Just ahead.

[Grain]

595
00:28:30,830 --> 00:28:31,710
This is it.

596
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,230
Mr. Wang!

597
00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:38,160
Who's that?

598
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:40,590
Mr. Wang!

599
00:28:41,190 --> 00:28:42,950
This is Mr. Wang.

600
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:46,640
You're no longer needed here.

601
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:48,880
Thank you.

602
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:53,760
You are here to buy grain?

603
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:54,680
That's right.

604
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:56,760
I heard
that among the five or six docks,

605
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:58,590
you have the most stock here.

606
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:00,950
How much do you need?

607
00:29:01,190 --> 00:29:02,000
This amount.

608
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:03,280
Six dan?

609
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:10,070
Mr. Wang, are you looking down on us?

610
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:11,760
Not at all.

611
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:12,920
Forgive me.

612
00:29:13,190 --> 00:29:16,230
So you want sixty dan?

613
00:29:19,230 --> 00:29:20,520
Sixty dan is too much

614
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:21,830
for you.

615
00:29:22,070 --> 00:29:23,190
We want six hundred dan.

616
00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:25,190
Six hundred dan?

617
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:29,680
Where are you from?

618
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:33,950
I'm Meng,

619
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:35,070
from Yangcheng.

620
00:29:35,710 --> 00:29:37,760
This is Ms. Liu, from the same place.

621
00:29:38,470 --> 00:29:39,680
From Yangcheng?

622
00:29:40,950 --> 00:29:41,800
What brings you here

623
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:43,230
from Yangcheng?

624
00:29:43,710 --> 00:29:45,230
We're collecting goods along the way.

625
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:47,310
Buying and selling,
regardless of the goods.

626
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:48,920
Right now, in the Shanxi-Shaanxi area,

627
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:50,710
the most sought-after item is grain.

628
00:29:50,950 --> 00:29:52,710
We inquired when we arrived

629
00:29:52,710 --> 00:29:54,310
and learned
that you have a sufficient supply.

630
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:55,680
That's why we came here.

631
00:29:58,070 --> 00:29:59,830
You've come to the right place.

632
00:30:01,590 --> 00:30:02,400
Mr. Wang,

633
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:03,470
I heard that your grain

634
00:30:03,470 --> 00:30:04,830
arrived just a few days ago.

635
00:30:05,590 --> 00:30:06,800
I'd like to know about the source.

636
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:11,400
Who are you, exactly?

637
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,350
You're trying to extract information.

638
00:30:17,350 --> 00:30:18,520
You want to bypass me

639
00:30:19,230 --> 00:30:20,560
and go directly to the supplier,

640
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:21,350
right?

641
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:26,000
Don't be too greedy.

642
00:30:26,230 --> 00:30:27,560
Finding a source like Mr. Wang's

643
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:28,400
is not easy.

644
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:29,560
Everyone can profit.

645
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:31,000
That way, we can have a steady flow.

646
00:30:31,310 --> 00:30:32,190
Besides,

647
00:30:32,190 --> 00:30:32,800
we need to hurry

648
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:33,760
to the next place.

649
00:30:34,470 --> 00:30:36,760
She is right, I was greedy.

650
00:30:37,110 --> 00:30:39,110
Mr. Wang, name your price.

651
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:41,830
Well...

652
00:30:42,950 --> 00:30:44,040
Well...

653
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:46,590
Here's what I propose:

654
00:30:47,430 --> 00:30:49,950
How about 3000 liang for 600 dan?

655
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:55,680
Looks like Mr. Wang

656
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:57,280
wants to hold out

657
00:30:57,350 --> 00:30:58,590
for a higher price.

658
00:31:01,470 --> 00:31:02,280
Mr. Wang,

659
00:31:02,830 --> 00:31:04,230
we are straightforward people.

660
00:31:04,470 --> 00:31:05,880
We like to get to the point in business.

661
00:31:06,590 --> 00:31:08,040
Since you seem hesitant,

662
00:31:08,310 --> 00:31:09,560
we won't disturb you.

663
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:11,680
Goodbye.

664
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:15,350
Wait.

665
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:18,520
Please wait! Don't go!

666
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:19,280
You must

667
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:21,350
give me a moment to gather my thoughts!

668
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:29,520

669
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:34,070
where are you and Yulan hiding?

670
00:31:36,110 --> 00:31:36,920
In Linfen?

671
00:31:39,350 --> 00:31:40,190
Or in Taiyuan?

672
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:43,680
I don't think so.

673
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:46,680
Stubborn Yulan,

674
00:31:47,710 --> 00:31:49,280
and foolish Qi.

675
00:31:50,430 --> 00:31:51,160
You wouldn't

676
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:52,400
run away on your own.

677
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:59,230
So what are you trying to do?

678
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:02,920
What are you trying to do?

679
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:09,920
Find evidence to turn things around?

680
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,350
Find evidence?

681
00:32:16,190 --> 00:32:17,000
Not a chance.

682
00:32:20,070 --> 00:32:20,880

683
00:32:24,470 --> 00:32:25,280

684
00:32:30,110 --> 00:32:31,760
Did those two ships of grain
get destroyed?

685
00:32:34,230 --> 00:32:35,110
Yes.

686
00:32:37,950 --> 00:32:39,350
Did you see it with your own eyes?

687
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:43,470
Master,

688
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:46,190
the night the grain was swapped,

689
00:32:46,190 --> 00:32:47,400
I was anxious to return.

690
00:32:48,190 --> 00:32:49,000
I repeatedly instructed Ma Wu,

691
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,520
who stayed at Taoyuan Ferry,

692
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:52,590
to ensure that the grain was destroyed.

693
00:32:58,230 --> 00:32:59,560
You fool!

694
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:05,400
Gather the men immediately.

695
00:33:07,430 --> 00:33:09,040
I'm going to Taoyuan Ferry myself.

696
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:11,070
Yes.

697
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:12,800
Get out!

698
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:21,710
Master,

699
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:23,640
a message from Mr. Liu.

700
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:25,590
He requests your presence
for discussion.

701
00:33:26,710 --> 00:33:29,280
What a fool!

702
00:33:30,470 --> 00:33:31,880
Utterly foolish!

703
00:33:34,070 --> 00:33:35,520
Do you know the trouble

704
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:37,110
you've caused by killing Qi Yanjin?

705
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:40,110
I have no personal feud with Qi Zongyue.

706
00:33:40,110 --> 00:33:42,070
We are political rivals.
Do you understand?

707
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:45,000
It means I want to crush him,

708
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,830
and it must be justifiable.

709
00:33:47,950 --> 00:33:49,160
By doing this,

710
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:51,470
you give my enemies leverage

711
00:33:51,470 --> 00:33:52,520
in the court.

712
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:53,350
Those colleagues of mine,

00:33:53,350 --> 00:33:54,800
who are sitting on the fence,

714
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:57,280
will sympathize with him.

715
00:33:59,110 --> 00:34:00,190
You'll achieve nothing,

716
00:34:00,190 --> 00:34:01,830
but you'll ruin everything.

717
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:06,680
I'm sorry.

718
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:09,000
Qi Yanjin escaped in a carriage.

719
00:34:09,430 --> 00:34:10,390
In a moment of panic,

720
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:12,230
my men shot arrows.

721
00:34:12,230 --> 00:34:13,950
Unexpectedly,
one of them struck a vital spot.

722
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:15,470
As I was trying to save him,

723
00:34:16,430 --> 00:34:17,630
he had already drawn his last breath.

724
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:19,280
I'm...

725
00:34:20,470 --> 00:34:21,280
I'm sorry,

726
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,560
but I didn't mean to kill him.

727
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:27,470
Do you really think

728
00:34:28,670 --> 00:34:30,360
that I've been sitting in the court

729
00:34:31,950 --> 00:34:33,470
without knowing anything?

730
00:34:35,630 --> 00:34:37,670
You know better than anyone

731
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,470
how Qi Yanjin died.

732
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:48,360
Within seven days, capture Qi Menglin.

you useless fool

735
00:34:55,150 --> 00:34:57,000
should never set foot in my door again.

See him out.

737
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:11,120
I understand.

00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:47,390
Slightly later than you.

743
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:51,560
You're so capable

744
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:53,430
