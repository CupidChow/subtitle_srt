4
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,630
This case should be retried.

5
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:36,360
What she just said

6
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:37,630
is still just speculation.

7
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:40,680
We need solid evidence to retry.

8
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:42,760
Chen,

9
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:45,040
you keep opposing retrying.

10
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,120
Could it be that

11
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:48,400
you were involved

12
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,590
in the forced confession before?

13
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:50,910
Mr. Qi,

14
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:52,360
you shouldn't say that.

15
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:54,270
I'm also new here.

16
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:58,000
Don't worry, Mr. Chen.

17
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,440
Retrying isn't the same as overturning.

18
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,680
We might find some real evidence

19
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:02,720
that could prove the previous magistrate

20
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:03,590
was right.

21
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:07,590
Call to Court.

22
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:09,600
Bring Xu Luan and Lin Xiong in.

Xu Luan.

29
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:44,630
You're shouting injustice in prison,

32
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,880
Your Honor, please take my side!

33
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:51,080
I'm truly wronged!

34
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,360
I swear I'm innocent!

35
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,390
You better provide

36
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:54,520
some solid evidence.

37
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:56,190
If I find out

38
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:57,670
you're stirring up trouble
for no reason,

39
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,960
you'll face both capital

40
00:02:58,960 --> 00:02:59,960
and severe punishments.

41
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,160
Yes!

00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:03,080
I swear I'm telling the truth!

43
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:06,160
I've always been on good terms
with the Lin family.

44
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:07,390
I had no reason

45
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:08,240
to kill Sanniang.

46
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:11,830
I was just delivering water that day.

47
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,160
Sanniang,
I've brought you some water.

48
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:28,880
Xu,

49
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,190
why did you take so long?

50
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:34,830
We've been out of water
at home for a while.

51
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,190
I've been waiting for you!

52
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:39,360
Come in quickly.

53
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:54,440
But there's water here.

54
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,670
This isn't enough!

55
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,800
Xu, are you hungry?

56
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:09,800
I just cooked some hot noodles.

57
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,270
Do you want to eat some before you go?

58
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:12,110
No, no!

59
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:13,030
I can't stay.

60
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:14,800
It's late; I have to go back.

61
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:17,390
Why are you in such a hurry?

62
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,110
Where are you rushing off to?

63
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,720
You're really something.

64
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,110
Just eat some before you go.

65
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:25,640
Why are you in such a rush?

66
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:26,550
Xu,

67
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:28,670
hope to see you again soon.

68
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,000
Take care.

69
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:37,440
So you and Lin Liu

70
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,720
have an affair after all.

71
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,790
I didn't!

72
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:41,440
No!

73
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,110
Then why was she so warm to you,

74
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:44,480
not caring about appearances?

75
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:47,390
Um...

76
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:48,440
Um...

77
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:49,350
So you're

78
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:50,390
not really innocent.

79
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,550
You are the real murderer!

80
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,600
You were involved with Lin Liu,

81
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:58,920
but then things went wrong.

82
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,720
In a fit of rage, you killed her.

83
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:01,550
No, no, no!

84
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,320
I'm innocent!

85
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,270
I have no affair

86
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:05,110
with Liu San Niang.

87
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:07,000
So why did you bring her water
at midnight?

88
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:09,230
Um...

89
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,000
Take him away.

90
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:12,440
Punish him.

91
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:13,720
Throw him back in the prison.

92
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:14,350
Yes.

93
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:16,920
Spare me, Your Honor!

94
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:17,350
Spare me!

95
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:18,720
I'm telling the truth!

96
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,320
I'm being honest!

97
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:21,160
Go on.

98
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,830
That night...

99
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:33,270
Sanniang,
I've brought you some water.

100
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,270
There's plenty of water today.

101
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:35,270
The water vat is full.

102
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:36,510
Sanniang, Xiong said

103
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:37,200
you are home alone.

104
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,070
What are you doing?

105
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,670
He specifically asked me
to check on you.

106
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,040
What are you doing?

107
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,350
I have liked you for a long time.

108
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:43,550
Just say yes for me.

109
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:44,760
What are you doing?

110
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:45,110
You...

111
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:46,000
What are you doing?

112
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:50,790
Get away!

113
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:51,230
You...

114
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:53,720
Get out!

115
00:05:56,550 --> 00:05:58,440
That day, I really did

116
00:05:58,510 --> 00:05:59,880
go deliver water to their house.

117
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:01,550
I did have some bad thoughts

118
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:02,350
about Liu Sanniang.

119
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,110
I wanted to get her into my grasp.

120
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:07,000
But I really didn't kill her!

121
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:07,550
I

122
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:08,880
didn't do it!

123
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,270
I'll find out

124
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:17,270
if what you're saying is true.

125
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:19,070
Take Lin Xiong in.

126
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,440
Take Xu Luan away.

127
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,230
Yes, sir.

128
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:27,350
Xiong!

129
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,270
Xiong!

130
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:29,200
You have to save me!

131
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,350
I didn't kill her!

132
00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:32,000
All these years,

133
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,390
I've kept ...

134
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:37,070
Go.

135
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:42,670
Keep what?

136
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:43,720
His purity or what?

137
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:50,830
I am Lin Xiong.

138
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:52,320
Greetings, Your Hornor.

139
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,230
You know Xu Luan well?

140
00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:56,070
Yes.

141
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:58,640
We were childhood friends.

142
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:00,070
Is he the murderer?

143
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,440
He had no reason to kill.

144
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,270
Have you heard the rumors?

145
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:11,440
That's nonsense.

146
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:14,880
They should be punished for that.

147
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,550
But he just confessed.

148
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:17,920
He said he had eyes for

149
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,270
your wife's beauty

150
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,510
and even tried to flirt with her.

151
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:23,670
Seems like those rumors

152
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:25,510
might hold some truth.

153
00:07:39,790 --> 00:07:41,350
I'll ask you again.

154
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:43,790
Is he the murderer?

155
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,390
I...

156
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:54,830
I don't know.

157
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:55,790
If we let Xu Luan go

158
00:07:55,790 --> 00:07:57,230
and don't catch the real murderer,

159
00:07:57,350 --> 00:07:59,600
this case might just go unresolved.

160
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,550
It's entirely

161
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:06,510
up to you.

162
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,270
I first felt Lin Xiong

163
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:15,160
was acting strange

164
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,320
when I heard from Captain Cai

165
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:17,720
about what happened that night.

166
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,230
Lin Xiong came to report it,

167
00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:20,550
panicked and scared,

168
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:21,950
but showing no sign of sadness.

169
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:23,480
And he was not stained

170
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:25,320
with any blood.

171
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:27,200
Captain Cai and Mr. Xu both said

172
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:28,880
the room was covered in blood.

173
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,200
Lin Liu's body

174
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,440
was soaked in it.

175
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:32,880
As a husband,

176
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:33,960
shouldn't he

177
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:34,760
have checked on his wife

178
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,590
after seeing that?

179
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,320
If he did,

180
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,080
he would've gotten blood on him.

181
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,280
The second time,

182
00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:42,200
when we

183
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,440
questioned Lin Xiong

184
00:08:43,910 --> 00:08:45,320
about his wife's death,

185
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,590
he was very calm.

186
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:47,760
If he were

187
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,000
a slow-witted person,

188
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:49,960
it wouldn't fit.

189
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,350
When we mentioned

190
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:53,400
the gossiping neighbors,

191
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:55,440
he showed disgust.

192
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:56,150
Right.

193
00:08:56,910 --> 00:08:57,670
I still remember

194
00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:58,840
that look he had.

195
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,280
The third time was just now.

196
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,280
When I told him

197
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:07,550
Xu Luan had ill intentions

198
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:08,760
towards Lin Liu,

199
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:09,590
his reaction

200
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:11,280
was neither anger nor sadness,

201
00:09:11,710 --> 00:09:13,350
not even shock or surprise.

202
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,150
Instead, it seemed like

203
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:20,640
contempt.

204
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,470
Almost like there was a hint

205
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:24,440
of mockery.

206
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,840
But all of this is just our speculation.

207
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,200
There's definitely something off

208
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,200
about his relationship with Xu Luan.

209
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,400
If Xu Luan is the murderer,

210
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:32,200
why is Lin Xiong protecting him?

211
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,030
If Xu Luan isn't the murderer,

212
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,320
then why does Lin Xiong

213
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,670
look at him so strangely?

214
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:44,320
Lin Xiong

215
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,200
is highly suspicious.

216
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,550
Xu Luan is surely innocent.

217
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:15,460
[Linfen]

218
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:22,880
What are you here for?

219
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,520
Same reason as you.

220
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:26,350
Lin Xiong!

221
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:27,640
Lin Xiong!

222
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,550
Lin Xiong, hurry back!

223
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:32,790
Ms. Zhang's house is on fire!

224
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:34,230
It's on fire!

225
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:35,910
Is everyone okay?

226
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:37,280
Everyone's fine.

227
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,840
Just burned a bit of the side room.

228
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,030
But your kid, Suo,

229
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:41,080
seems scared.

230
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:41,710
He can't

231
00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:42,880
stop crying.

232
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:45,590
As long as everyone's okay.

233
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,080
Then let's go.

234
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:49,440
I'll have a shift change

235
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:51,350
in a bit.

236
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:53,080
What?

237
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,080
Hurry up and go.

238
00:10:57,470 --> 00:10:58,880
I'll go tell the Gatekeeper.

239
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:11,520
Here.

240
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:12,550
Hold him.

241
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,110
He got scared today.

242
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,110
He might run a fever.

243
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,840
Keep an eye on him tonight.

244
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,590
He's not that fragile,

245
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,110
and he'll be fine
after a night's sleep.

246
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:24,470
Sorry for the trouble.

247
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:25,440
No problem.

248
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,080
Why did the fire suddenly start?

249
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,350
Maybe I was careless.

250
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:32,880
Hurry back.

251
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,000
Go back.

252
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:45,710
Still warm.

253
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:47,640
Xiong!

254
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:48,880
Is your kid okay?

255
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:50,030
You're back.

256
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:53,320
As long as he's okay.

257
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:55,760
I'm telling you,

258
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,550
the Lin Xiong family

259
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:58,670
is really unlucky.

260
00:11:58,670 --> 00:11:59,520
Totally true.

261
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:00,760
Wherever the Lins go,

262
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:01,640
there's bound to be trouble.

263
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:03,230
Exactly! They're always
cause trouble everywhere.

264
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,790
Ms. Zhang is pretty unlucky.

265
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:07,520
I've got some news.

266
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:08,760
I bet no one knows this.

267
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:09,590
Spill it, spill it!

268
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:10,760
My nephew

269
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,670
was working at the yamen yesterday.

270
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:14,030
He overheard the guards saying

271
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:14,880
that Xu Luan

272
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:16,910
bribed

273
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:18,030
the new magistrate

274
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:18,710
to get his case overturned.

275
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:19,350
Is this true?

276
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:20,080
Really?

277
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:22,110
I thought it was big news.

278
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:23,470
I've heard about it

279
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:25,000
at my tea stall long ago.

280
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:25,960
I also know

281
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:27,960
that Lin Xiong killed Sanniang.

282
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,550
Really? He did it?

283
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:30,640
Absolutely.

284
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:33,080
I saw Lin Xiong being taken to the yamen

285
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,840
with my own eyes yesterday.

286
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,080
Is that true?

287
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:38,880
I heard he caught them in the act.

288
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,440
Then he personally

289
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,030
killed his wife,

290
00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:43,670
blaming it on Xu Luan.

291
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:44,910
These people are so annoying.

292
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:45,760
They know nothing,

293
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:46,840
just talking nonsense.

294
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,080
What do they have to fear?

295
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:51,030
They won't be held responsible
for mistakes.

296
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,230
True.

297
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:53,880
If they guess right,

298
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:55,470
they can boast about it.

299
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,230
Officer,

300
00:12:57,550 --> 00:12:58,880
if this case gets solved,

301
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,080
I'll be the hero.

302
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,280
Come on, just say it!

303
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,470
She's rambling.

304
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:03,590
This could be...

305
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,000
Stop crying, little one!

306
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,520
I have to get up early tomorrow.

307
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,400
Please, stop crying.

308
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:11,550
Stop crying now.

309
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:14,400
Alright, stop crying.

310
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:15,230
Stop crying.

311
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:50,790
What are you doing here?

312
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:51,280
Didn't you

313
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:52,320
go to ask Xu Luan?

314
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:53,520
It isn't as exciting as tailing someone.

315
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:54,110
Besides, I worry about you

316
00:13:54,110 --> 00:13:54,960
being alone.

317
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,470
Why are you in such a hurry?

318
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,230
Stop knocking! Stop knocking!

319
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:13,200
I won't do house calls at night.

320
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,470
Come back tomorrow morning.

321
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:16,710
Uncle, it's me!

322
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,590
It's way past midnight.

323
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:21,080
What's wrong?

324
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,350
He is burning up!

325
00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:23,320
Can you take a look?

326
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:24,470
Come in quickly!

327
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:32,790
Come on, let's get the kid undressed.

328
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,280
This is a lung heat issue.

329
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,230
He is drooling,
and his fontanelle is swollen.

330
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:52,470
These symptoms
are due to stagnation of qi and blood,

331
00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:53,470
and disharmony
of the spleen and stomach.

332
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:56,320
So he is restless.

333
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:58,910
I'll start with acupuncture
and then some medicine.

334
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:02,080
Since his mother passed,

335
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,910
he's been sick every day.

336
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:05,280
I finally get a break

337
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:06,200
from the night shift today,

338
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:08,110
but I can't even
get a good night's sleep.

339
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:10,960
Sorry to trouble you.

340
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,440
You didn't rest well tonight either.

341
00:15:13,590 --> 00:15:14,470
I'm sorry about that.

342
00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:16,000
I'm fine.

343
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,840
Looks like

344
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,880
he got scared the other day.

345
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,280
It's normal for him to get sick.

346
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:25,440
Since he was born,

347
00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:27,590
nothing but trouble.

348
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,150
I'll start with needling Baihui

349
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,440
and Fengmen acupoints.

350
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:35,640
Hold the child still.

351
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:36,960
Don't let him move around.

352
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:44,440
How much longer?

353
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:45,760
Almost done.

354
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:49,440
Come on, kid, stop crying.

355
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,080
This little one is so annoying!

356
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:56,960
You chose this path,

357
00:15:57,550 --> 00:15:58,550
so don't complain.

358
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:11,960
Doctor!

359
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,280
One of the guards has a headache.

360
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:14,640
Please prescribe him some medicine.

361
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:18,840
Aren't you Lin Xiong?

362
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:22,320
Your kid is sick?

363
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:24,440
Yeah, he suddenly started burning up
at midnight.

364
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:26,030
Uncle,

365
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,590
this is Chief Luo from the yamen.

366
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:28,640
Just wait a moment.

367
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:30,280
I'll treat the child first.

368
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,080
Okay.

369
00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:41,150
This isn't working.

370
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:42,150
Let me handle it.

371
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:43,640
Look over here.

372
00:17:04,710 --> 00:17:05,520
Thanks.

373
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:07,040
No problem.

374
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,280
My sister's kid

375
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:09,590
used to cry a lot when he was little.

376
00:17:09,590 --> 00:17:11,070
Whenever he cried,

377
00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:12,430
I would comfort him like this.

378
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:16,110
I didn't expect

379
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,160
raising a kid would be this hard.

380
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,880
This kid lost his mother young.

381
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:22,880
It's so sad.

382
00:17:23,430 --> 00:17:24,040
Raising a child

383
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:25,470
all by yourself

384
00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:26,710
is not easy.

385
00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:28,400
I still need to make a living.

386
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:30,760
I'm busy all day watching the gate

387
00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:33,280
and barely have time for him.

388
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:36,040
Sometimes I regret having him.

389
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:40,470
You're just stubborn but soft-hearted.

390
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:42,830
The medicine is ready.

391
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:44,230
One dose in the morning and evening.

392
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:46,190
Remember, simmer it on low heat.

393
00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:47,190
Thanks, Doctor.

394
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:48,350
Goodbye.

395
00:17:59,110 --> 00:18:00,040
Sir,

396
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:01,830
what happened to your colleague?

397
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:02,920
He has a headache?

398
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:05,230
Yeah, he's rolling around in pain.

399
00:18:07,230 --> 00:18:10,040
A headache can be serious.

400
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:13,160
I'll get him some calming herbs.

401
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,760
If that doesn't work,
we can try something else.

402
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,680
Alright, thanks, Doctor.

403
00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:27,400
You and Lin Xiong know each other well.

404
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:28,830
We're neighbors

405
00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:31,470
and somewhat distantly related.

406
00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:33,470
Don't you think

407
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:35,470
the kid's features

408
00:18:35,470 --> 00:18:37,230
don't resemble Lin Xiong?

409
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:43,470
I hadn't noticed that.

410
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:45,400
I just heard some gossip

411
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,760
while walking down the street.

412
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:50,520
What about your colleague?

413
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:52,160
Isn't his headache really bad?

414
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:54,310
The medicine is ready. Hurry back.

415
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:55,800
Thanks, Doctor.

416
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:03,830
You're still awake this late?

417
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:07,880
I just started feeling a bit sleepy,

418
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:09,760
but this rough bedding

419
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,070
makes my whole body ache.

420
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:12,920
Come here.

421
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:15,000
Feel this.

422
00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:16,680
How can I sleep like this?

423
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:19,000
If this were at Mingke House,

424
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,520
even the kitchen maid

425
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:21,470
wouldn't bother with it.

426
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:24,680
Come here, Cui.

427
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:26,400
Let me give you a good massage.

428
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:37,680
Miaocui.

429
00:19:39,310 --> 00:19:41,190
Do you think there are people

430
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:42,520
who don't love their own kids?

431
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:43,830
I don't have kids.

432
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:44,880
How would I know?

433
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,400
But it seems

434
00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:51,640
unlikely, right?

435
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:53,350
As for men...?

436
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,310
What's up with you tonight?

437
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,110
With all this talk about kids and men,

438
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:04,310
you're not having spring feelings,
are you?

439
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,400
You're just talking nonsense.

440
00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:13,430
When will our removal papers

441
00:20:13,430 --> 00:20:14,950
be ready?

442
00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:16,400
I don't want to stay

443
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,560
in this dump any longer.

444
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:19,680
Magistrate Han

445
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:20,760
has submitted the papers.

446
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,160
Let's be patient.

447
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:23,520
Just wait a little longer.

448
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:25,830
Alright, I'll trust you

449
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:27,070
one more time.

450
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:28,710
Get some rest early.

451
00:20:42,310 --> 00:20:45,640
It used to be lively at Mingke House.

452
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:55,040
I suspect

453
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:55,800
Lin Xiong isn't

454
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:57,110
the real father of Suo.

455
00:20:57,110 --> 00:20:57,830
Really?

456
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:00,230
What makes you think that?

457
00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:03,310
Lin Xiong's neighbors say

458
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:04,590
that Lin Xiong and Lin Liu

459
00:21:04,590 --> 00:21:05,470
were married for six months

460
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:06,830
before Suo was born.

461
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:08,710
But Lin Xiong claims

462
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:10,640
he was intimate
with Lin Liu long before,

463
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:11,920
so the kid is his.

464
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:13,830
Yet, the attitude

465
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:14,680
that he reveals unintentionally

466
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:16,000
can't be faked.

467
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,230
Last night, when Suo had a high fever,

468
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:19,920
I followed them to the medical clinic

469
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:21,160
and observed him closely.

470
00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:22,400
Lin Xiong showed no concern

471
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,520
at all.

472
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:24,710
He was just impatient

473
00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:26,110
and even a bit disgusted.

474
00:21:26,310 --> 00:21:27,110
That's not

475
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:27,950
how a real father

476
00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:29,000
reacts.

477
00:21:30,070 --> 00:21:30,880
Also,

478
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,350
the doctor

479
00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:34,000
seems to know this secret too

480
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:35,470
and is trying to keep it hidden.

481
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:39,760
How did I not notice that?

482
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:43,160
You think Xu Luan is helping Lin Xiong

483
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:44,560
keep this secret?

484
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:45,560
Yes.

485
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:48,430
This is a two-bird stone situation.

486
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:51,040
First, he gets rid of Liu Sanniang

487
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:53,280
and frames Xu Luan,

488
00:21:53,830 --> 00:21:56,110
eliminating that cheating couple.

489
00:21:56,470 --> 00:21:57,830
Lin Xiong can kill with a borrowed knife

490
00:21:57,830 --> 00:21:58,800
and get rid of the one

491
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:00,230
who knows his secret.

492
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:02,640
So why did he defend Xu Luan

493
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:03,800
in court?

494
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:08,800
He's playing hard to get.

495
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:10,070
Xu Luan can't escape the death penalty.

496
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:11,070
Lin Xiong knows this,

497
00:22:11,070 --> 00:22:12,230
so he pretends

498
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:13,160
to defend him.

499
00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:15,190
If Lin Xiong accused him of murder,

500
00:22:16,230 --> 00:22:18,000
wouldn't that expose himself?

501
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:23,680
Why would he want to

502
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:25,040
hide this secret?

503
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,280
Does he really care about Lin Liu?

504
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:30,160
Luo Shu,

505
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:32,470
what do you think?

506
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:57,520
Are you done yet?

507
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:58,710
Can I get some sleep?

508
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:03,400
Baozi!

509
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:04,680
I'm leaving now.

510
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:06,110
I'll help you chop wood later.

511
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:08,920
Cai Dabing...

512
00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:11,070
Who's that? So annoying!

513
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:16,190
Sorry, Miaocui.

514
00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:18,470
My brother didn't know
you were sleeping.

515
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,400
Next time,
we'll chop wood in the afternoon

516
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,880
and won't disturb you again.

517
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:24,400
Baozi, what are you saying?

518
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:25,350
Um...

519
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:26,950
I'm just getting up.

520
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:28,710
No wonder

521
00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:30,590
you're from Mingke House.

522
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,920
You don't get up until noon,

523
00:23:33,310 --> 00:23:34,350
saving all your energy

524
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:36,350
for the night, huh?

525
00:23:36,350 --> 00:23:37,280
What are you talking about?

526
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:40,710
I'm confused.

527
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:43,000
You live in the county yamen,

528
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,950
and who

529
00:23:44,950 --> 00:23:46,470
were you with last night?

530
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:47,400
The officials

531
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:49,230
don't come here.

532
00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:51,230
Looks like

533
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:52,310
even our rough clerks

534
00:23:52,590 --> 00:23:54,880
catch your eye.

535
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,400
What are you saying?

536
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,560
So even the courtesans at Mingke House

537
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:01,110
aren't that high-maintenance after all.

538
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:02,760
You old hag,

539
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:04,280
I'll shut you up for good.

540
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:06,040
Look at you, all tough and fierce!

541
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:07,040
You think last night

542
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:08,400
you could just sleep with any man

543
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,400
and he'd

544
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,310
support you?

545
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:11,880
Ms. Sun, stop talking.

546
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:12,950
You're just trash,

547
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:14,560
sullying this place.

548
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,950
Ms. Sun, just stop it.

549
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:18,590
Ms. Sun!

550
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:20,470
What's going on here?

551
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,310
Why are you so worked up?

552
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:27,710
Ms. Sun!

553
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:29,400
We…

554
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,430
What are you doing?

555
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:36,310
We don't stay here often,

556
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,560
so we might need some time to adjust.

557
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,110
Please bear with us.

558
00:24:40,470 --> 00:24:41,800
You're so understanding.

559
00:24:54,830 --> 00:24:55,710
What are you up to?

560
00:24:55,710 --> 00:24:56,190
Get up.

561
00:24:56,190 --> 00:24:57,070
What are you doing?

562
00:24:57,070 --> 00:24:57,560
Go.

563
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:58,430
What are you doing?

564
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,070
What do you want?

565
00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:01,310
Chief Luo.

566
00:25:01,310 --> 00:25:02,280
You're going to take me where?

567
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:04,190
Someone identified you as the murderer.

568
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,000
I'm innocent!

569
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:06,230
Go!

570
00:25:06,230 --> 00:25:07,280
I'm innocent!

571
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:08,070
You know that!

572
00:25:08,070 --> 00:25:09,430
I'm innocent!

573
00:25:09,710 --> 00:25:10,590
I didn't kill anyone!

574
00:25:10,590 --> 00:25:11,520
I swear I didn't!

575
00:25:12,230 --> 00:25:13,350
I didn't kill anyone!

576
00:25:17,710 --> 00:25:19,350
I didn't kill her!

577
00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:20,190
I didn't kill anyone!

578
00:25:20,230 --> 00:25:21,070
I'm innocent!

579
00:25:21,310 --> 00:25:22,230
You have to believe me!

580
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:23,160
I really didn't do it!

581
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:24,590
The family of the victim
identified you directly

582
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:26,640
as the murderer.

583
00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:27,920
Lin Xiong!

584
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:29,950
No, no way!

585
00:25:30,310 --> 00:25:31,040
Look closely!

586
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:33,590
This is Lin Xiong's confession.

587
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:35,920
How could he...

588
00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:37,110
No, it's impossible!

589
00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:38,110
Your Honor!

590
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:40,160
These scoundrels

591
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,350
won't confess unless you use torture.

592
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:44,230
Lin Xiong wants to harm me.

593
00:25:44,230 --> 00:25:45,230
He's framing me!

594
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:47,040
Why would he frame you?

595
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:51,230
Check if the iron is hot?

596
00:25:51,230 --> 00:25:51,880
Yes.

597
00:25:53,470 --> 00:25:54,190
No!

598
00:25:54,190 --> 00:25:55,310
No, no!

599
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:57,040
I'll say it!

600
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:58,280
He's framing me!

601
00:25:58,280 --> 00:25:59,070
He wants to silence me!

602
00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:00,110
He's framing me!

603
00:26:02,230 --> 00:26:03,590
He wants to silence you!

604
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:06,950
Looks like you know something.

605
00:26:07,950 --> 00:26:08,560
Say it.

606
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,070
You say or not?

607
00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:11,310
He's not capable in that way.

608
00:26:11,310 --> 00:26:12,640
Lin Xiong's not capable in that way.

609
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:14,110
Lin Xiong's not capable in that way.

610
00:26:15,710 --> 00:26:16,830
Only his uncle and I

611
00:26:16,830 --> 00:26:17,800
know about this.

612
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:20,110
I mean Dr. Wang, our neighbor.

613
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:22,190
Lin Xiong was injured as a child.

614
00:26:22,470 --> 00:26:23,280
I took him

615
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:24,560
to Dr. Wang for treatment.

616
00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:25,350
After that,

617
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:26,520
he couldn't perform sexually.

618
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:28,110
He married a beautiful wife,

619
00:26:28,230 --> 00:26:29,470
but she was just a decoration at home.

620
00:26:31,710 --> 00:26:33,110
You coveted Lin Liu,

621
00:26:33,230 --> 00:26:34,880
and wanted to do something immoral.

622
00:26:35,110 --> 00:26:36,830
She screamed for help and fought back.

623
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:38,520
So you panicked,

624
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:40,070
and in a rush,
killed her to silence her.

625
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:42,160
How could I have that ability?

626
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,560
I just had a couple of drinks

627
00:26:44,710 --> 00:26:46,280
and joked with Lin Xiong,

628
00:26:46,470 --> 00:26:47,830
saying if he couldn't do it,

629
00:26:47,830 --> 00:26:49,430
I could help him out

630
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:50,800
to avoiding leaving his wife

631
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,160
alone.

632
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,230
He talked a good game,

633
00:26:53,230 --> 00:26:55,070
about brothers being like family,

634
00:26:55,110 --> 00:26:56,230
and women being like clothing,

635
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,000
but behind the scenes,
he stabbed me in the back.

636
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,680
You're saying the murder

637
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:01,310
is his framing you?

638
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:02,560
Exactly.

639
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:03,680
I think

640
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:04,350
it was Lin Xiong who did it.

641
00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:05,640
I was suspicious too

642
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:07,470
because Sanniang's death was strange.

643
00:27:07,710 --> 00:27:08,680
When I left,

644
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:09,350
she was fine.

645
00:27:09,430 --> 00:27:10,560
As soon as he came back, she was dead.

646
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:11,520
He definitely killed her.

647
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:12,430
He set me up.

648
00:27:12,430 --> 00:27:13,070
He did it!

649
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:14,110
Xu Luan!

650
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:17,920
I defended you countless times,

651
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,160
and you bite me back!

652
00:27:20,830 --> 00:27:21,920
Defend me?

653
00:27:22,190 --> 00:27:24,280
Lin Xiong, you're framing me!

654
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:25,800
You want to kill me indirectly

655
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:27,950
to make me shut up, but I won't!

656
00:27:27,950 --> 00:27:29,590
You fake-hearted loser!

657
00:27:29,590 --> 00:27:30,520
I'm going to shut you up for good.

658
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:31,230
Come on!

659
00:27:31,230 --> 00:27:32,880
Let's go down together!

660
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:35,070
It was him! He killed my wife!

661
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:35,830
It was him!

662
00:27:36,950 --> 00:27:37,830
You're talking nonsense.

663
00:27:38,230 --> 00:27:39,190
Your wife.

664
00:27:39,470 --> 00:27:40,680
Did you even care about your wife?

665
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:42,160
Can you perform sexually?

666
00:27:42,190 --> 00:27:43,430
I'll kill you!

667
00:27:43,430 --> 00:27:44,230
Come on!

668
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:45,830
I'll kill you!

669
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:46,560
Lin Xiong!

670
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,000
You're not capable in that way.

671
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,110
So you're twisted inside.

672
00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:50,190
Your wife's beauty

673
00:27:50,190 --> 00:27:51,400
brought gossip.

674
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:53,560
You felt unwarranted hatred

675
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:54,110
and did something brutal,

676
00:27:54,110 --> 00:27:56,310
like killing her
and cutting off her head,

677
00:27:56,590 --> 00:27:57,560
then framed Xu Luan.

678
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:58,350
Is that right or not?

679
00:27:58,350 --> 00:27:59,110
No!

680
00:27:59,430 --> 00:28:00,640
I didn't care

681
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:01,800
if Liu Sanniang
upheld the virtue of a wife.

682
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:02,560
You don't care!

683
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:04,070
As a man,

684
00:28:04,190 --> 00:28:06,070
you didn't care

685
00:28:06,070 --> 00:28:07,190
if your wife
upheld the virtue of a wife.

686
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:12,950
Is it really true like Xu Luan said,

687
00:28:14,190 --> 00:28:15,230
you're not capable in that way?

688
00:28:21,590 --> 00:28:23,400
Your Honor, apply pressure.

689
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:26,590
Lin Xiong!

690
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:30,280
You're a man.

691
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:34,110
A real man should stand tall.

692
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,110
If you don't speak up,

693
00:28:36,470 --> 00:28:38,430
you'll just be a useless loser,

694
00:28:38,710 --> 00:28:40,310
and Xu Luan will look down on you.

695
00:28:55,710 --> 00:28:57,230
I'm really not capable in that way.

696
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,760
When I married Liu Sanniang, the widow,

697
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:04,760
I was only after

698
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:05,920
her unborn child.

699
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:09,400
I thought
as long as I covered it up well,

700
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,070
everyone would think

701
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:14,000
that was my biological child.

702
00:29:15,470 --> 00:29:16,950
Liu Sanniang knew this.

703
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:18,280
We were just

704
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:19,430
using each other.

705
00:29:20,430 --> 00:29:21,470
There was no affection involved,

706
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:25,470
let alone jealousy or resentment.

707
00:29:29,230 --> 00:29:30,430
Lin Xiong and Xu Luan

708
00:29:30,430 --> 00:29:31,800
are probably telling the truth.

709
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:32,950
But what about the murderer?

710
00:29:32,950 --> 00:29:34,110
Who is the murderer?

711
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,430
There are only three people
in this room.

712
00:29:36,430 --> 00:29:37,680
Why are you shouting

713
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:38,280
so loudly?

714
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:40,430
Why did you push to investigate
and overturn the case?

715
00:29:40,430 --> 00:29:41,350
Well now,

716
00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:42,880
a solid case has turned into a mystery.

717
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,070
How will this end?

718
00:29:44,190 --> 00:29:45,000
Your Honor!

719
00:29:46,070 --> 00:29:47,590
Your Honor, something happened!

720
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:49,760
Liu Sanniang and Ms. Zhang
have no grudges,

721
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:50,950
so why would Liu Sanniang's ghost

722
00:29:50,950 --> 00:29:52,280
is scaring her.

723
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:53,710
I think

724
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:56,280
Liu San Niang is here
looking for her child.

725
00:29:57,070 --> 00:29:59,310
Last night, Suo was here.

726
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,280
Excuse me, excuse me!

727
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:01,310
Come on, move aside!

728
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:02,040
Don't push me!

729
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:02,760
Let us through!

730
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:05,560
Officer! Officer!

731
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,190
She died

732
00:30:07,190 --> 00:30:08,230
and now wants to take the child?

733
00:30:08,230 --> 00:30:08,520
Exactly!

734
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:09,760
She wants to take Suo!

735
00:30:11,190 --> 00:30:12,760
Every time Lin Xiong is on duty,

736
00:30:13,830 --> 00:30:15,640
he asks me to look after Suo.

737
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:18,310
I thought we're all neighbors,

738
00:30:18,310 --> 00:30:20,710
so I gave him a hand.

739
00:31:06,430 --> 00:31:07,070
Who?

740
00:31:07,190 --> 00:31:08,430
Ghost!

741
00:31:09,590 --> 00:31:11,070
It must be Liu Sanniang.

742
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:12,640
She died so tragically

743
00:31:12,830 --> 00:31:14,190
that she came back as a vengeful ghost.

744
00:31:19,070 --> 00:31:20,710
She only saw a shadow,

745
00:31:20,710 --> 00:31:21,920
not clearly at all.

746
00:31:21,950 --> 00:31:22,760
It's haunted!

747
00:31:22,830 --> 00:31:23,760
I heard it's haunted!

748
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:24,520
Tell me about it!

749
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
Nothing much to say.

750
00:31:26,190 --> 00:31:27,560
There are no ghosts in this world.

751
00:31:28,310 --> 00:31:29,310
How do you know there aren't?

752
00:31:29,310 --> 00:31:31,230
If it were a ghost, why broke in?

753
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:35,760
Then it must be a thief!

754
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:37,400
But Ms. Zhang said

755
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:38,040
the shadow

756
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:39,520
went straight for Suo.

757
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:40,590
If it were a thief,

758
00:31:40,590 --> 00:31:42,310
they should've looked for money first.

759
00:31:42,310 --> 00:31:44,040
See? It's still a ghost!

760
00:31:44,350 --> 00:31:45,590
No matter if it is...

761
00:31:45,590 --> 00:31:46,310
It's a ghost.

762
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:48,800
No matter if it is human or ghost,

763
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:50,560
they got scared and ran away,

764
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:52,230
which means they didn't succeed.

765
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
They might come back.

766
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:22,310
Don't move!

767
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:23,470
Ouch! Ouch!

768
00:32:23,470 --> 00:32:24,160
Let go! Let go!

769
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:26,400
I'm on your side!

770
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:27,920
I'm on your side! Ouch!

771
00:32:27,950 --> 00:32:28,950
Ouch! Ouch!

772
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:33,070
Move aside! Move aside!

773
00:32:34,310 --> 00:32:35,230
Are you okay, Mr. Qi?

774
00:32:35,230 --> 00:32:36,470
I'll remember you.

775
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:37,560
What are you doing here?

776
00:32:37,590 --> 00:32:38,590
I came to catch a ghost!

777
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:40,000
Can you tell
if it's a person or a ghost

778
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:40,760
before catching anyone?

779
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:41,920
I'll remember you.

780
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,710
You have great skills!

781
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:46,430
Why praise me now?

782
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:47,310
Of course!

783
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:48,880
You're so tall,

784
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,190
but you climbed such a low wall

785
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:51,430
with such trouble.

786
00:32:51,430 --> 00:32:52,520
What do you know?

787
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:54,110
I saw some clues

788
00:32:54,110 --> 00:32:55,470
on the wall,

789
00:32:55,470 --> 00:32:56,710
and I just slipped accidentally.

790
00:32:56,950 --> 00:32:57,830
What clues?

791
00:32:58,310 --> 00:32:58,800
Come here!

792
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:02,470
Take a look.

793
00:33:03,710 --> 00:33:05,190
It looks like a cut from a sharp object.

794
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:07,230
The marks look fresh.

795
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:08,830
They must have been made recently.

796
00:33:10,470 --> 00:33:11,430
We've solved the case!

797
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:15,560
How did we solve it?

798
00:33:16,350 --> 00:33:17,880
Don't you know
about the notorious thief?

799
00:33:17,950 --> 00:33:19,760
What do they use to scale walls?

800
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:21,710
Sky-climbing claws!

801
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:24,830
This was caused by sky-climbing claws.

802
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:33,800
So this thief

803
00:33:34,830 --> 00:33:36,760
can only "fly" as high
as a person's height.

804
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:45,640
This is indeed

805
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:46,950
the mark of claws.

806
00:33:48,070 --> 00:33:49,110
What did I say?

807
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:51,920
This courtyard wall is low enough

808
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:53,000
for a regular person

809
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,190
to jump up and grab the top.

810
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:55,710
Why use claws?

811
00:33:55,830 --> 00:33:57,430
Maybe it's a short person.

812
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:58,470
Like you, for example.

813
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:00,040
You can't even reach the top.

814
00:34:00,350 --> 00:34:01,470
And if it's a fat person,

815
00:34:01,470 --> 00:34:03,230
they might not even be able to jump up!

816
00:34:06,950 --> 00:34:07,920
Chief Luo's not happy.

817
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:39,150
What's going on?

818
00:34:41,470 --> 00:34:44,430
A detective must be flexible.

819
00:34:57,710 --> 00:34:59,150
Flexible.

820
00:35:05,150 --> 00:35:06,280
Come up here.

821
00:35:38,190 --> 00:35:38,840
Got it!

822
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:40,280
What is it?

823
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:40,950
Take a look.

824
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:45,080
Sure enough, there's something here.

825
00:35:45,630 --> 00:35:47,040
Looks like that shadow went
to Ms. Zhang's place

826
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:48,870
specifically for Suo.

827
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:49,910
Well.

828
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:51,360
Is this really a notorious thief

829
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:52,320
or is it a ghost?

830
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:53,600
If it's a ghost,

831
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:54,630
then why does it
not just walk through walls

832
00:35:54,630 --> 00:35:55,600
instead of using claws?

833
00:35:57,670 --> 00:35:58,470
You're right.

834
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:00,150
It might really be a ghost.

835
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:21,280
What are you doing again?

836
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:23,630
Don't get it, huh?

837
00:36:23,870 --> 00:36:25,520
This is a detective's usual trick.

838
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:27,840
Imitating the criminal's actions

839
00:36:27,950 --> 00:36:29,840
can reveal

840
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:31,430
their process.

841
00:36:32,630 --> 00:36:33,710
What did you figure out?

842
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:50,600
Take a look.

843
00:36:52,390 --> 00:36:53,280
What did you find?

844
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:00,390
Looks like it's not a ghost.

845
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,040
Otherwise, there wouldn't be footprints.

846
00:37:02,670 --> 00:37:04,430
One and a half footprints.

847
00:37:05,190 --> 00:37:06,120
It must be a limp's.

848
00:37:07,630 --> 00:37:08,710
A limp?

849
00:37:13,630 --> 00:37:15,230
The person who went to Binzhou replied.

850
00:37:17,390 --> 00:37:18,320
No need to look.

851
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:19,560
According to the Binzhou Yamen,

852
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:21,040
Li Fengchun is dead.

853
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:26,040
Li Fengchun was with a merchant group

854
00:37:26,190 --> 00:37:27,910
when they were attacked
by bandits in Binzhou.

855
00:37:27,910 --> 00:37:29,710
He was severely injured
and fell off a cliff.

856
00:37:30,150 --> 00:37:31,600
His body wasn't found.

857
00:37:32,910 --> 00:37:34,390
Since that,

858
00:37:34,430 --> 00:37:35,760
how can Binzhou Yamen claim

859
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:36,630
he's dead?

860
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:39,390
He was severely injured
and fell off a cliff.

861
00:37:39,950 --> 00:37:40,800
It's strange if he didn't die.

862
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:43,470
Someone witnessed

863
00:37:43,470 --> 00:37:44,950
Li Fengchun fall off the cliff.

864
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:46,630
They say that cliff is dangerous.

865
00:37:46,910 --> 00:37:48,840
After falling,
survival is nearly impossible.

866
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:50,710
The Binzhou Yamen sent people
to search but found nothing,

867
00:37:50,710 --> 00:37:51,870
so they concluded he was dead.

868
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:54,230
But the absence of a body

869
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:55,430
is indeed

870
00:37:55,630 --> 00:37:57,150
suspicious.

871
00:37:58,280 --> 00:37:59,360
I believe

872
00:37:59,470 --> 00:38:01,040
Li Fengchun is still a suspect.

873
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:02,560
Even if the chances are slim.

874
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:06,710
There's still a chance

875
00:38:06,710 --> 00:38:07,520
he became a vengeful ghost.

876
00:38:08,150 --> 00:38:09,600
There are no ghosts in this world,

877
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,630
only human hearts with hidden motives.

878
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:13,870
What made you think

879
00:38:13,870 --> 00:38:15,390
Li Fengchun is the murderer?

880
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:17,840
People act for a reason.

881
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:19,950
It comes from the heart and emotions.

882
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:21,280
Liu Sanniang was clearly

883
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:22,630
murdered with a knife.

884
00:38:22,870 --> 00:38:23,600
Yet the murderer

885
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:24,670
stabbed her

886
00:38:24,670 --> 00:38:25,760
multiple times

887
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,280
and even decapitated her.

888
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:29,560
Such extreme rage

889
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:31,760
shows the murderer's

890
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:32,870
intense hatred.

891
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:36,190
Xu Luan has feelings for her,

892
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:40,120
while Lin Xiong is indifferent.

893
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:42,080
So, I was wondering

894
00:38:42,710 --> 00:38:44,080
who would hate Liu Sanniang

895
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:45,150
the most.

896
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:48,320
Go.

897
00:38:48,390 --> 00:38:49,360
Gather everyone here.

898
00:38:49,950 --> 00:38:51,470
Young Master,
this isn't an investigation.

899
00:38:51,470 --> 00:38:53,120
This is more like a charity event.

900
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:54,150
What are you babbling about?

901
00:38:54,150 --> 00:38:55,000
Hurry up!

902
00:38:55,470 --> 00:38:56,430
Yes, Young Master.

903
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:08,470
Big news! Big news!

904
00:39:08,470 --> 00:39:09,560
Liu Sanniang is dead!

905
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:11,360
And then the vengeful ghost is coming!

906
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:12,800
Just the other night,

907
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:14,000
I passed by the Lin family's door

908
00:39:14,430 --> 00:39:15,470
and saw a shadow.

909
00:39:15,470 --> 00:39:16,870
It had long hair.

910
00:39:16,870 --> 00:39:18,560
It was floating away.

911
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:20,150
Its nails were all curved.

912
00:39:20,230 --> 00:39:21,320
The vengeful ghost

913
00:39:21,910 --> 00:39:23,080
was dressed in red,

914
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:24,950
with blood oozing from seven orifices!

915
00:39:27,230 --> 00:39:28,040
I'm so scared!

916
00:39:28,190 --> 00:39:29,870
That kid was taken away!

917
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,080
This red-dressed ghost

918
00:39:31,150 --> 00:39:32,470
died with a grievance.

919
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:33,470
Liu Sanniang...

920
00:39:33,470 --> 00:39:34,190
They all jump

921
00:39:34,190 --> 00:39:35,710
to conclusions.

922
00:39:35,910 --> 00:39:37,320
Some dare to speak;
some dare to believe.

923
00:39:37,670 --> 00:39:38,230
It's like

924
00:39:38,230 --> 00:39:39,760
they've experienced it themselves.

925
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:41,800
The more they spread the rumors,

926
00:39:42,230 --> 00:39:43,600
the greater the chance

927
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:44,390
of seeing a ghost at night.

928
00:39:51,470 --> 00:39:52,800
Open!

929
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:57,000
What's going on?

930
00:39:57,910 --> 00:39:59,430
Can he help?

931
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:03,710
Yuqing has summoned you,

932
00:40:03,910 --> 00:40:05,360
stand before the altar.

933
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:06,910
Hurry, as the law commands!

934
00:40:08,230 --> 00:40:09,040
It's appearing!

935
00:40:09,950 --> 00:40:11,560
The ghost is here!

936
00:40:11,950 --> 00:40:13,360
It's Liu Sanniang's vengeful ghost.

937
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:14,080
It's appearing!

938
00:40:17,710 --> 00:40:19,320
It's gone again!

939
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:21,040
You can't escape!

940
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:22,390
The sorcerer has gone in!

941
00:40:25,470 --> 00:40:26,120
Look!

942
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:27,320
The sorcerer is fighting it!

943
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:28,280
They're fighting!

944
00:40:28,630 --> 00:40:29,360
Can the sorcerer

945
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:30,560
win against the ghost?

946
00:40:30,670 --> 00:40:31,520
Definitely!

947
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:32,670
Hope he can win!

948
00:40:34,910 --> 00:40:35,630
Look, look!

949
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:37,600
The sorcerer is out!

950
00:40:39,950 --> 00:40:41,520
Master!

951
00:40:41,910 --> 00:40:43,520
Master, be careful!

952
00:40:44,230 --> 00:40:45,150
Master, how's it going?

953
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:46,870
This ghost has deep resentment

954
00:40:46,870 --> 00:40:47,910
and strong karma.

955
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:49,360
If I force it out,

956
00:40:49,710 --> 00:40:51,000
it might backfire.

957
00:40:51,430 --> 00:40:52,870
I might not be able to handle it.

958
00:40:53,150 --> 00:40:54,120
Even you

959
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:55,430
can't deal with that female ghost.

960
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:57,710
Looks like this ghost is truly powerful.

961
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:02,040
What should we do now?

962
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:03,080
You two

963
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:04,390
should leave.

964
00:41:04,470 --> 00:41:05,760
Your lives are more important.

965
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:07,320
Yes!

966
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:08,800
Don't get us involved!

967
00:41:09,190 --> 00:41:10,080
Just go!

968
00:41:10,390 --> 00:41:11,150
You need to leave!

969
00:41:11,150 --> 00:41:11,910
Hurry and go!

970
00:41:11,910 --> 00:41:13,230
Don't get us involved!

971
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:14,870
Tomorrow,

972
00:41:17,150 --> 00:41:18,710
I'll take my child back home

973
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:20,840
and won't come back.

974
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:21,470
You need to leave!

975
00:41:21,470 --> 00:41:22,430
Don't come back!

976
00:41:22,430 --> 00:41:23,910
Please don't return!

977
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:25,600
Don't come back!

978
00:41:25,870 --> 00:41:28,190
Don't drag us down!

979
00:41:57,670 --> 00:42:01,760
I died so miserably.

980
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:05,910
We were once husband and wife.

981
00:42:06,670 --> 00:42:10,870
Why did you have to take my life?

982
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:12,080
Shut up!

983
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:13,520
You shameless woman!

984
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:16,000
Even if I kill you a thousand times,

985
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:18,600
it still wouldn't ease my hatred.

986
00:42:18,710 --> 00:42:20,360
Got him! Got him!

987
00:42:21,670 --> 00:42:22,470
Be careful!

988
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:25,230
Put the knife down!

989
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:26,080
Get out!

990
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:31,630
Step back!

991
00:42:37,710 --> 00:42:38,560
Li Fengchun!

992
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:42,390
I never expected

993
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:45,000
to end up like this,

994
00:42:45,470 --> 00:42:47,000
yet you can still recognize me.

995
00:42:52,150 --> 00:42:53,000
Li Fengchun!

996
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:55,390
Today, you can't escape!

997
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:56,390
Escape?

998
00:42:57,080 --> 00:42:58,560
I never intended to survive.
