[Episode 16]

4
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,480
What's going on?

5
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:48,870
Maybe one
of the abandoned mines collapsed.

6
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:50,400
Oh no.

7
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,080
Luo Shu and Commandant Qi
are still inside.

8
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,830
Young Master! Young Master!

9
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:54,870
Young Master!

10
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:13,910
My legs!

11
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:14,960
Get up!

12
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:15,550
Slowly.

13
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:19,030
Don't be scared.

14
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,240
The mine ahead has exploded.

15
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,360
We're fine here.

16
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:24,520
Mr. Wang saved us.

17
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:26,800
Don't worry.

18
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,270
We've already sent word

19
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:29,630
to the authorities.

20
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:31,360
Someone will come to rescue us.

21
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:32,880
Right now, all we can do

22
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:34,440
is conserve our energy.

23
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:38,240
Luo Shu!

24
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:39,360
Young Master!

25
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:40,320
Luo Shu!

26
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:42,550
Luo Shu!

27
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:44,520
- Luo Shu!
- Mr. Qi!

28
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:45,390
Luo Shu!

29
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:46,270
Young Master!

30
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:47,390
- Luo Shu!
- Commandant Qi!

31
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:48,550
Hurry, move!

32
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:51,830
Young Master!

33
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:55,800
Young Master!

34
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:04,960
No way!

35
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:06,270
This is the worst part

36
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:07,360
of the collapse zone!

37
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,320
Hurry, move!

38
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,600
Is there another entrance?

39
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:11,360
Get those two over here!

40
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:17,750
Is there

41
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,320
another entrance?

42
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:21,320
This is just an abandoned mine.

43
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,000
No more entrances.

44
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:25,030
Any others?

45
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:26,600
Any at all?

46
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:29,270
Is there any other entrance?

47
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:32,240
Tell me!

48
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:34,190
Tell me!

49
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:37,320
Please stop.

50
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,470
It will collapse.

51
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,080
If you're really starving,

52
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:12,030
just take a bite.

53
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:28,760
Tastes good.

54
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:30,790
Better than delicacies!

55
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:32,510
You're joking.

56
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:33,720
I'm not joking.

57
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,040
Are you regretting it now?

58
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:40,390
Regret what?

59
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:41,720
This case,

60
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,070
you've suffered so much.

61
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,480
And now you're stuck here.

62
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:47,830
You could have easily

63
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:49,000
not come along.

64
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:51,000
I'd regret not coming!

65
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:54,440
Because I'd be worried
about you every day,

66
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:56,830
wondering

67
00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:00,070
if you could solve the case.

68
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:04,320
Don't worry.

69
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,320
Mr. Wang won't die in vain.

70
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:07,440
We will definitely

71
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,640
catch those bad guys.

72
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:13,790
I'm

73
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:15,200
the Deputy Commandant of Pingyangwei!

74
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:17,160
In matters like this,

75
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,480
it's my responsibility.

76
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,440
Ever since I started
wandering the world,

77
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:22,440
I set a goal for myself

78
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,230
to do ten heroic deeds.

79
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:25,720
You know that.

80
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,320
What you're doing now

81
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,200
counts

82
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,920
as ten heroic deeds.

83
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,000
Really?

84
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:39,320
It's great now.

85
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:48,830
Everyone, stay safe!

86
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:53,160
Wu Er!

87
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:54,880
Wu Er! Wu Er!

88
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,390
Your Honor!

89
00:05:56,510 --> 00:05:57,790
Take that shepherd boy with you.

90
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,920
and search carefully around the mine.

91
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,480
If you find an entrance,
report it immediately.

92
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,200
Yes.

93
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:05,070
Everyone, be careful!

94
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,390
Give it to me.

95
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:07,350
Give me!

96
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,510
Slow down, Your Honor!

97
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,920
Everyone, work harder!

98
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:16,230
Give me!

99
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,040
Everyone, stay safe!

100
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:30,480
Your Honor!

101
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:32,000
Your Honor!

102
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:34,670
Come on, give it to me!

103
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:35,350
I found something!

104
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:36,000
What is it?

105
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:36,440
I'm not sure

106
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:37,390
if it counts as an entrance.

107
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:38,040
It's really small.

108
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:38,790
Where is it?

109
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,350
It's halfway up the hill.

110
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:43,880
Captain Cai!

111
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:45,720
I'll leave some people

112
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,040
with you to continue clearing up here.

113
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:48,950
The rest, follow me.

114
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:49,640
Okay.

115
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:51,670
Everyone else, keep clearing up.

116
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:53,160
Okay, hurry up.

117
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:08,200
Your Honor, it's right here.

118
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:11,830
This is a vertical shaft.

119
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:13,600
Come here.

120
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:17,950
What's it like down there?

121
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:18,950
It's a big space.

122
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:20,040
It's quite spacious below.

123
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:21,040
Can it connect

124
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,110
to my young master's place?

125
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:25,880
You guys wait here.

126
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,070
I'll go check it out.

127
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,510
Do you think

128
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:48,640
we can escape?

129
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,230
We definitely can.

130
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:56,950
I trust Zao Hua.

131
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,350
I trust Mr. Chen.

132
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:01,880
I trust

133
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,000
Magistrate Han.

134
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:06,230
They will

135
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:07,760
definitely save us.

136
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:11,640
That's good.

137
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,270
Actually,

138
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:26,200
even if we can't escape,

139
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,110
I won't lose anything.

140
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:33,320
What are you talking about?

141
00:08:35,470 --> 00:08:36,880
I'd be the one losing out.

142
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:42,910
I haven't gotten my removal papers.

143
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:45,320
I haven't lived

144
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:47,110
the life I truly want.

145
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:49,840
I haven't even married yet.

146
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:53,400
There are so many things I want to do,

147
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,640
but I haven't done them yet.

148
00:08:56,590 --> 00:08:57,880
Do you think I'm losing out?

149
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:01,230
Yeah, you are.

150
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,550
Don't be afraid.

151
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:09,550
Trust me.

152
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:11,000
I will keep you safe.

153
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,440
I trust you.

154
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:15,030
You'll keep me safe.

155
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:21,150
But you're stuck here too.

156
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,150
How can you keep me safe?

157
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:26,230
My grandma always says

158
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:27,470
I'm a lucky person.

159
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:31,200
I'll share some of my luck with you.

160
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,200
We will definitely escape.

161
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:51,320
Your Honor,

162
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:53,030
this is also a dead shaft.

163
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,110
It doesn't connect

164
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:54,910
to the one below.

165
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:57,790
Maybe if we dig a bit,
we can connect them.

166
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:07,280
Come on.

167
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,230
Dig in this direction.

168
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:19,550
Everyone,

169
00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:21,640
let's get energized.

170
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:23,590
This is a matter of life and death.

171
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:27,880
Sir, help me out, please!

172
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:31,880
It's a matter of life and death!

173
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:32,670
Please, help!

174
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:37,470
I have silver notes!

175
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:38,470
I have silver notes!

176
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,520
If you save my young master,

177
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:42,590
everyone

178
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:44,280
will get 50 liang.

179
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:45,640
Fifty liang each.

180
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:46,590
A hundred liang!

181
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:47,520
A hundred liang!

182
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:48,550
Not only that,

183
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,150
I'll also advocate
for your merits.

184
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,590
Come on, everyone, get moving!

185
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:54,200
Get moving!

186
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,150
There's money and rewards!

187
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:55,550
Come on!

188
00:10:55,550 --> 00:10:56,790
Quick, get moving, dig!

189
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:57,910
There's money and rewards!

190
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:11,640
Be careful!

191
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,470
Pull with all your strength!

192
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:33,790
Luo Shu!

193
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:36,880
Luo Shu, don't sleep!

194
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:40,030
Luo Shu!

195
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:41,080
I'm so sleepy.

196
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:42,790
Wake up; you can't sleep!

197
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:44,400
You can't sleep!

198
00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:46,110
Listen,

199
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,400
someone's coming to save us!

200
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:49,670
Listen!

201
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:53,440
I didn't hear anything.

202
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:55,760
You're lying again.

203
00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:00,280
Luo Shu!

204
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,790
Chat with me.

205
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:14,030
Okay.

206
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,910
What do you want to chat about?

207
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,000
Let's talk

208
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,350
about what kind of man you like.

209
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:22,470
Boring.

210
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,470
If I asked you this normally,

211
00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:28,960
you'd have driven me away by now.

212
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,080
But you can't drive me away now.

213
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:34,150
Just tell me about it.

214
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:38,910
I want to see where he falls short
compared to me.

215
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:43,710
He

216
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:48,640
is warm and gentle,

217
00:12:51,710 --> 00:12:53,710
honest and upright,

218
00:12:55,790 --> 00:12:57,200
and fiercely hates evil.

219
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:00,470
What a true man should do?

220
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,280
Respect heaven and earth.

221
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:04,030
Serve the people.

222
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:05,880
Inherit the classics of the sages.

223
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,760
Build peace for the world.

224
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:09,150
What a great ambition!

225
00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:10,960
Impressive.

226
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:20,110
She can't be talking about me, right?

227
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:23,350
I, Qi Menglin,
the Deputy Commandant of Pingyangwei,

228
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:25,200
led the troops to eliminate bandits

229
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,280
and returned in triumph,

230
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:30,400
so I'm here to report back to you.

231
00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:42,710
He has the common people in his heart,

232
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:48,910
being genuine and carefree,

233
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:53,350
never indecisive

234
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:55,670
for the sake of worldly gains.

235
00:13:56,110 --> 00:13:56,880
Did I become an official

236
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,080
to make friends?

237
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,350
But don't forget,

238
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:01,080
the former magistrate has been promoted.

239
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,790
He's your superior now.

240
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:03,880
Do you not understand

241
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,030
the stakes?

242
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:06,670
Since I've been favored by the Emperor

243
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:08,400
to protect a region,

244
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,400
and to guide the people,

245
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:10,910
I must ensure
there are no wrongs unrighted

246
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:12,520
and no cases left uninvestigated.

247
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:14,790
It sounds just like me.

248
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,670
Come and see.

249
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:19,440
Mr. Qi is doing good deeds.

250
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,200
Everyone gets
a share of the food and oil.

251
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:26,640
It's great.

252
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:27,880
Being in the world

253
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:28,910
and doing chivalrous deeds,

254
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:29,590
today,

255
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:31,350
I robbed the rich to help the poor.

256
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:37,200
Whenever I'm sick,

257
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:40,880
he always comes to see me.

258
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:42,670
It's ginger decoction.

259
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:43,910
Drink it while it's hot.

260
00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:48,790
If it doesn't taste good,
please forgive me.

261
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:51,400
Why?

262
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:55,880
I cooked it myself.

263
00:14:56,790 --> 00:14:59,080
Whenever I'm in danger,

264
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,150
he always shows up in time.

265
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,550
Step back! All of you!

266
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,150
Let her go.

267
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:08,840
I'll be your hostage.

268
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:19,200
Jin Nang!

269
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:20,910
Help her!

270
00:15:33,790 --> 00:15:34,960
That's me!

271
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,280
Luo Shu.

272
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:40,200
Luo Shu.

273
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:51,590
Today,

274
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:52,670
thank you for saving my life.

275
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:55,670
Looks like

276
00:15:59,590 --> 00:16:01,440
you really admire him.

277
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:07,080
Then why don't you

278
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,350
tell him how you feel?

279
00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:11,590
What's his name?

280
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:13,080
Can I know him?

281
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:16,320
I...

282
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:20,470
Luo Shu.

283
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,080
Luo Shu.

284
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:23,470
Don't sleep!

285
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:25,080
Luo Shu!

286
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:26,840
Wake up!

287
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:28,640
You tell me

288
00:16:28,710 --> 00:16:30,520
what that man's name is!

289
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:31,550
Hurry!

290
00:16:32,350 --> 00:16:33,150
Luo Shu.

291
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,440
Luo Shu, tell me quickly

292
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:37,790
what that man's name is.

293
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,760
Or else there really won't be a chance.

294
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:50,790
Sir,

295
00:16:52,030 --> 00:16:53,400
hold on a bit longer.

296
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:55,350
Hold on a bit longer.

297
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:57,350
We can't get through to the other side.

298
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,710
Sir!

299
00:17:06,830 --> 00:17:07,710
Hold on a bit longer!

300
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:13,950
I'll give you all these silver notes.

301
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:15,430
Just hold on a bit longer!

302
00:17:17,110 --> 00:17:17,950
Forget it.

303
00:17:19,070 --> 00:17:20,800
We might live to earn,

304
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:22,760
but won't live to spend it.

305
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:23,590
Exactly.

306
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:25,950
Try again.

307
00:17:26,190 --> 00:17:27,560
Sir!

308
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:33,680
Your Honor!

309
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:35,000
Everyone can't hold on anymore.

310
00:17:35,710 --> 00:17:36,400
Could it be

311
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,430
that we dug in the wrong direction?

312
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:40,280
This isn't working.

313
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:41,800
How about we go out

314
00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:43,350
and team up with Captain Cai

315
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:44,950
to put in some effort over there?

316
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:46,430
At least that direction

317
00:17:46,430 --> 00:17:47,640
can't be wrong.

318
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:01,680
If you can't hold on,

319
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:05,710
just retreat.

320
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:10,310
Retreat.

321
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:17,760
Hurry up!

322
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:02,560
Clear!

323
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:12,950
Luo Shu!

324
00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:14,640
Someone's here to rescue us!

325
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,190
Really, someone's coming to save us!

326
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:18,310
Listen! I'm not lying this time.

327
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:19,560
Someone's really coming!

328
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:21,560
Clear!

329
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:40,920
We're here!

330
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:44,590
We're over here!

331
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,680
Wake up!

332
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:49,350
We're over here!

333
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:09,920
Luo Shu!

334
00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:12,280
Luo Shu! Luo Shu!

335
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,400
Help!

336
00:20:15,950 --> 00:20:17,190
They're inside.

337
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:18,880
They are still alive.

338
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,230
Help!

339
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:38,230
It's clear! It's clear!

340
00:20:38,430 --> 00:20:40,040
It's clear! It's clear!

341
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:41,590
Young Master!

342
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:42,830
Is that you, Young Master?

343
00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:44,110
Are you alive?

344
00:20:44,190 --> 00:20:45,560
We're all alive.

345
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:46,560
Alive!

346
00:20:57,430 --> 00:20:58,230
Luo Shu!

347
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:15,520
I knew you would come.

348
00:21:32,710 --> 00:21:33,920
Hoping to find a soul mate

349
00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:36,230
with whom I want to be for life.

350
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:55,280
Meiqing!

351
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:57,230
You've been here

352
00:23:57,230 --> 00:23:58,350
for a whole day and night,

353
00:23:59,190 --> 00:24:00,160
not eating or drinking.

354
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:01,560
This can't go on.

355
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:03,040
You should go home tomorrow

356
00:24:03,430 --> 00:24:04,350
and take a break for a few days.

357
00:24:05,950 --> 00:24:08,190
Take Zao Hua back to Mantian Ridge,

358
00:24:09,230 --> 00:24:10,710
and spend time with your father.

359
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:24,640
Muzhi.

360
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,520
I used to think

361
00:24:31,950 --> 00:24:33,400
that as a true man,

362
00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:35,800
we should have lofty ambitions

363
00:24:36,710 --> 00:24:38,110
and achieve

364
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:40,950
something great

365
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:44,350
to not waste a lifetime of learning.

366
00:24:46,590 --> 00:24:47,950
But now

367
00:24:49,430 --> 00:24:50,830
I understand

368
00:24:52,430 --> 00:24:54,230
life is only a few decades long,

369
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:58,040
and we should live for ourselves once.

370
00:25:02,110 --> 00:25:03,520
If you meet someone

371
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:06,000
you truly like,

372
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:10,520
you shouldn't let her go.

373
00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:20,400
Luo Shu turned you down before

374
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,110
because I went to find her.

375
00:25:24,950 --> 00:25:25,760
She

376
00:25:27,190 --> 00:25:28,640
really does care about you.

377
00:25:31,110 --> 00:25:32,640
For your future,

378
00:25:33,830 --> 00:25:35,470
she chose to let go.

379
00:25:37,470 --> 00:25:39,230
Now I can understand

380
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:46,430
how much pain

381
00:25:47,430 --> 00:25:48,470
she felt back then.

382
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:55,470
Doumiao,

383
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:56,880
how did you meet

384
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:57,830
Mr. Wang

385
00:25:57,830 --> 00:25:59,000
and Dongmei?

386
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:00,430
A few years ago,

387
00:26:00,590 --> 00:26:02,400
my sister was kidnapped
by the White Ant.

388
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:04,400
I chased after them
and found this place,

389
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,070
where I met Dongmei.

390
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:07,520
She was the cook at the mine.

391
00:26:08,070 --> 00:26:08,880
She has a good heart.

392
00:26:09,070 --> 00:26:10,430
Not only did she take me in,

393
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:11,400
but she also wanted to help me rescue

394
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:13,000
my sister and the other women.

395
00:26:14,230 --> 00:26:17,520
But then she was discovered
by Qian Dayou.

396
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,950
Looks like Mr. Wang is fulfilling

397
00:26:23,950 --> 00:26:25,310
Dongmei's last wish.

398
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,430
I want to avenge my sister.

399
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,520
Mao wants to avenge Dongmei too.

400
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:31,710
We've been relying

401
00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:33,560
on each other all these years.

402
00:26:34,230 --> 00:26:35,830
Then why didn't you report it?

403
00:26:35,950 --> 00:26:37,000
We did.

404
00:26:37,350 --> 00:26:38,160
The previous magistrate

405
00:26:38,190 --> 00:26:39,880
was in cahoots with Qian Dayou

406
00:26:40,190 --> 00:26:41,640
and didn't take this case.

407
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:42,800
Mao has been hiding his identity,

408
00:26:42,830 --> 00:26:43,830
sneaking into the mine

409
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:45,430
to find a chance

410
00:26:45,430 --> 00:26:46,800
to avenge Dongmei

411
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:48,160
and to rescue

412
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:49,280
those poor women.

413
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:51,590
When Dongmei was around,

414
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:54,110
Mao came to the mine a couple of times.

415
00:26:54,470 --> 00:26:56,000
To avoid being recognized,

416
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:57,070
he

417
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:00,350
even went as far as
to mutilate his own face.

418
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:31,320
[The Tomb of Wang Mao and Dongmei]

419
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:41,110
Mao,

420
00:27:42,230 --> 00:27:43,920
you finally reunited with Dongmei.

421
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:45,760
Are you happy?

422
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:48,470
Qian Dayou has been sentenced

423
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:49,830
to death.

424
00:27:50,430 --> 00:27:51,800
Eunuch Zhang can't escape either.

425
00:27:52,710 --> 00:27:54,830
[The Tomb of Wang Mao and Dongmei]
Your revenge is settled.

426
00:27:55,110 --> 00:27:57,280
Dongmei's revenge is settled too.

427
00:28:00,190 --> 00:28:01,000
Mr. Wang,

428
00:28:02,110 --> 00:28:03,430
you can finally rest.

429
00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:24,350
Your Honor.

430
00:28:24,350 --> 00:28:26,000
Can I come in and say a few words?

431
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:44,800
Did you hear

432
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:46,110
what I said that day?

433
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
What did you say?

434
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:51,000
I didn't hear anything.

435
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,070
I like you.

436
00:28:53,070 --> 00:28:54,190
I want to stay with you till old age.

437
00:29:01,470 --> 00:29:03,590
That day was just like this.

438
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:06,800
You saw me after the disaster,

439
00:29:07,950 --> 00:29:08,950
so you couldn't control your emotions.

440
00:29:09,830 --> 00:29:10,880
Why take it too seriously?

441
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:12,800
I saw you after the disaster,

442
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:15,070
so my feelings are genuine.

443
00:29:16,350 --> 00:29:17,880
Stop speaking insincerely.

444
00:29:23,110 --> 00:29:24,760
Last time you rejected me,

445
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:27,640
was it because
you didn't have feelings for me,

446
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:29,920
or did Meiqing tell you

447
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:31,000
something?

448
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:33,430
You and I are worlds apart.

449
00:29:33,590 --> 00:29:34,040
Yes,

450
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:37,520
we are worlds apart.

451
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:43,350
Even in despair,

452
00:29:43,590 --> 00:29:44,800
you won't give up,

453
00:29:45,430 --> 00:29:46,160
determined to take

454
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:47,680
your destiny into your own hands.

455
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:49,470
But what about me?

456
00:29:49,950 --> 00:29:50,710
I'm just

457
00:29:50,710 --> 00:29:52,280
a weak and useless son-in-law.

458
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:53,590
Don't say that.

459
00:29:54,430 --> 00:29:57,110
I know you have great ambitions.

460
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,040
When I was a child,
my family once

461
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:00,070
arranged my marriage.

462
00:30:00,830 --> 00:30:01,800
But when the other party learned

463
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,310
that Mr. Liu
had taken an interest in me,

464
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:05,760
they came to cancel the engagement.

465
00:30:06,350 --> 00:30:07,310
Though I felt

466
00:30:07,310 --> 00:30:08,400
it shouldn't be like this,

467
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:11,000
I didn't say anything.

468
00:30:14,190 --> 00:30:14,950
I actually look down

469
00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:15,830
on myself like this.

470
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:19,430
But I tried to convince myself

471
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:21,230
that the process doesn't matter.

472
00:30:21,230 --> 00:30:22,590
What matters is the outcome.

473
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:24,230
As long as I can achieve my ideals,

474
00:30:25,430 --> 00:30:27,230
what does it matter
if I'm a son-in-law Mr. Liu picked?

475
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,280
In the official world,

476
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:31,640
having connections
makes everything easier.

477
00:30:32,590 --> 00:30:33,680
I had planned

478
00:30:34,470 --> 00:30:35,920
to give up romantic love in this life,

479
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,070
seeking only the great path.

480
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:41,070
But I happened to meet you.

481
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,190
If it weren't for divine mercy that day,

482
00:30:44,350 --> 00:30:46,040
you and I would be worlds apart.

483
00:30:47,110 --> 00:30:47,800
Luo Shu,

484
00:30:50,230 --> 00:30:51,680
I don't want to be timid anymore.

485
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:53,760
I want to break off the engagement.

486
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:56,110
I want to be with you until old age.

487
00:30:58,190 --> 00:30:59,280
Hearing you say that,

488
00:31:01,310 --> 00:31:02,640
I already feel very content.

489
00:31:03,710 --> 00:31:05,280
But you absolutely can't do that.

490
00:31:06,590 --> 00:31:08,350
If you offend Mr. Liu for my sake,

491
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,640
what will your future career look like?

492
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:11,760
It's all about effort.

493
00:31:13,070 --> 00:31:14,760
I'm willing to take the risk for you.

494
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:26,400
This is a bracelet

495
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,710
my mother left for me.

496
00:31:28,350 --> 00:31:29,950
I've always kept it with me.

497
00:31:31,230 --> 00:31:33,040
Now I realize

498
00:31:33,470 --> 00:31:34,400
I only want to give it to

499
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,950
the one I truly love.

500
00:31:38,070 --> 00:31:40,160

to take a gamble with me?

Young Master!

519
00:33:24,830 --> 00:33:26,430
Here, give it a try!

520
00:33:36,470 --> 00:33:37,280
How is it?

521
00:33:39,110 --> 00:33:39,920
Delicious.

522
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:54,040
Young Master, should we head back now?

523
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:54,920
If you keep swinging like this,

524
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:56,640
you'll wear your shoulder out.

525
00:33:58,190 --> 00:33:59,640
Can you stop worrying about me?

526
00:34:00,310 --> 00:34:01,950
I'm just looking out for you.

527
00:34:06,070 --> 00:34:06,800
Young Master,

528
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:07,520
if something's

529
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:08,320
bothering you,

530
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:09,230
just talk to me.

531
00:34:09,230 --> 00:34:10,430
Don't hold it in.

532
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,190
Why would I be upset?

533
00:34:12,430 --> 00:34:13,710
Do I need to be upset?

534
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:15,390
Is there any reason for me to be upset?

535
00:34:15,870 --> 00:34:16,430
No.

536
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:17,190
Young Master,

537
00:34:17,190 --> 00:34:19,000
you're the son of Governor Qi,

538
00:34:19,390 --> 00:34:20,320
the Deputy Commandant of Pingyangwei.

539
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:21,280
As long as you want,

540
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:22,190
you'll have many women around you.

541
00:34:22,190 --> 00:34:23,760
No need to stick to just one.

542
00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:25,280
What are you talking about?

543
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:35,710
Let's go.

544
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,040
Young Master, where are we headed?

545
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:39,520
We should enjoy life while we can.

546
00:34:40,470 --> 00:34:41,670
Let's go drink with my friends.

547
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:42,870
Sounds good!

548
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,800
The scenery in the South
is different from the North.

549
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:47,870
The food of Jiangnan

550
00:34:47,870 --> 00:34:49,150
is also different from Shanxi.

551
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:52,280
One day, we'll go back together

552
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:54,430
to where I grew up.

553
00:34:54,710 --> 00:34:56,560
The food and scenery there

554
00:34:57,150 --> 00:34:58,430
will definitely impress you.

555
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:18,390
When I was six,

556
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:20,320
my parents passed away

557
00:35:20,470 --> 00:35:21,560
and I fell into slavery.

558
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,150
At twelve, more misfortune hit,

559
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,560
and I was sent to Mingke House.

560
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:28,950
From that moment on,

561
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:29,950
my fate

562
00:35:29,950 --> 00:35:31,910
was no longer in my hands.

563
00:35:33,470 --> 00:35:34,520
To survive,

564
00:35:35,230 --> 00:35:36,760
I had to be cautious at all times,

565
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:38,430
watching people's reactions,

566
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:40,150
navigating around them.

567
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:42,520
The madam guarded me more than a thief.

568
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:44,390
Not to mention the South,

569
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,280
even the scenery of Linfen,

570
00:35:46,630 --> 00:35:48,080
I hardly got to see.

571
00:35:50,630 --> 00:35:52,560
I don't want to live like this forever.

572
00:35:54,470 --> 00:35:55,470
I can't accept it.

573
00:35:56,470 --> 00:35:57,080
All these years,

574
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:58,800
I've only had one thought.

575
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:00,560
That's to escape my lowly status

576
00:36:00,670 --> 00:36:01,760
and break free from this life.

577
00:36:04,390 --> 00:36:05,360
I hope that one day,

578
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:06,870
when I

579
00:36:06,870 --> 00:36:08,670
regain my freedom,

580
00:36:09,710 --> 00:36:11,560
I can truly be myself,

581
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:14,320
no longer a servant to others,

582
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:16,320
nor a tool for anyone.

583
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:18,190
At that time,

584
00:36:19,390 --> 00:36:21,870
I can go wherever I want.

585
00:36:22,870 --> 00:36:24,430
Whether it's the Southern scenery

586
00:36:24,710 --> 00:36:25,910
or your hometown,

587
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:27,710
I'll definitely check it out.

588
00:36:29,470 --> 00:36:30,150
Okay!

589
00:36:31,150 --> 00:36:32,230
The application for your removal papers

590
00:36:32,230 --> 00:36:33,710
have been submitted for a while.

591
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:34,800
In these days,

592
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,190
there should be a response soon.

593
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:38,040
Just stay calm.

594
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:39,800
I'll do my best

595
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,280
to make your wish come true.

596
00:36:44,190 --> 00:36:44,870
Cheers!

597
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:45,800
Cheers!

598
00:36:46,150 --> 00:36:46,560
Cheers!

599
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:47,910
Cheers!

600
00:36:49,630 --> 00:36:50,430
Everyone,

601
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,320
today our mission is simple:

602
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:53,360
relax

603
00:36:53,430 --> 00:36:54,670
and enjoy your food and drinks!

604
00:36:54,670 --> 00:36:56,120
Okay!

605
00:36:57,870 --> 00:36:59,470
Come on, pour the drinks!

606
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,390
Eat up!

607
00:37:00,390 --> 00:37:01,150
Everyone,

608
00:37:01,710 --> 00:37:04,120
Commandant Qi
doesn't mind our roughness,

609
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:06,670
and is willing to treat us as brothers.

610
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:07,760
Usually,

611
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:09,280
he treats us to food and drinks.

612
00:37:09,430 --> 00:37:11,150
We all respect you.

613
00:37:11,150 --> 00:37:12,120
So, everyone,

614
00:37:12,390 --> 00:37:13,190
let's

615
00:37:13,230 --> 00:37:14,230
toast to Commandant Qi!

616
00:37:14,230 --> 00:37:16,120
Okay. Cheers!

617
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:17,280
Everyone, cheers!

618
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:19,120
Cheers!

619
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:24,520
I'd like to toast to you.

620
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:25,390
Come on, drink up!

621
00:37:25,390 --> 00:37:26,040
Let's go!

622
00:37:27,710 --> 00:37:29,080
I'd like to toast to you.

623
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:29,800
Come on. Drink up!

624
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:30,840
Take it easy on the drinks!

625
00:37:34,470 --> 00:37:35,950
Fill it up!

626
00:37:36,430 --> 00:37:37,560
Drink, drink, drink!

627
00:37:37,710 --> 00:37:38,520
Come on!

628
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:39,080
Fill it up!

629
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:40,670
Down it, down it, down it!

630
00:37:41,630 --> 00:37:42,910
Down it! Drink!

631
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:45,870
Drink up, drink up!

632
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:47,390
Pour the drinks!

633
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,150
We're a couple now.

634
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:26,710
Come on!

635
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:33,150
Don't get involved
in this kind of thing.

636
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:52,670
What's on my face?

637
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,670
The scenery by the Fen River
is beautiful.

638
00:38:59,950 --> 00:39:02,040
How about we go together tomorrow?

639
00:39:03,630 --> 00:39:04,430
Sounds good!

640
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:08,760
Young Master, Young Master!

641
00:39:09,630 --> 00:39:10,430
Young Master!

642
00:39:10,670 --> 00:39:11,870
Spit it out and it'll be fine.

643
00:39:11,870 --> 00:39:12,670
Spit it out.

644
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:15,470
I told you

645
00:39:15,470 --> 00:39:16,430
not to drink

646
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:17,520
so much.

647
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:18,760
But you insisted on drinking.

648
00:39:20,950 --> 00:39:22,080
Next time, do not drink, okay?

649
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:23,000
Do not drink next time.

650
00:39:30,950 --> 00:39:32,390
I miss Luo Shu.

651
00:39:34,870 --> 00:39:36,040
I miss Luo Shu.

652
00:39:57,430 --> 00:39:58,230
Mr. Chen.

653
00:40:00,870 --> 00:40:01,710
Are you looking for Magistrate Han?

654
00:40:02,710 --> 00:40:03,840
He went to the county school.

655
00:40:04,230 --> 00:40:05,150
What's he doing there?

656
00:40:05,470 --> 00:40:06,950
A new group of students arrived,

657
00:40:06,950 --> 00:40:08,150
and he was asked
to lead their initiation ceremony.

658
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:11,040
Come and see the rice and flour!

659
00:40:12,430 --> 00:40:13,630
Rice and flour!

660
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:16,670
Rice and flour!

661
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:23,910
Come and see the rice and flour!

662
00:40:24,430 --> 00:40:26,040
Come, sir, want to buy some rice?

663
00:40:31,710 --> 00:40:33,710
Young Master, Young Master!

664
00:40:35,470 --> 00:40:36,320
What's wrong with you?

665
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:40,120
If I were

666
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:43,150
to make you carry two sacks of grain,

667
00:40:43,230 --> 00:40:44,320
two sacks of beans,

668
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,390
and two bottles of rapeseed oil,

669
00:40:49,710 --> 00:40:51,390
would you feel tired?

670
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:54,800
Young Master, what do you want to do?

671
00:40:57,710 --> 00:40:58,560
Laozi said,

672
00:40:58,710 --> 00:41:00,150
[Lize Academy]
"A sage has no fixed mind,

673
00:41:00,430 --> 00:41:02,230
and he considers the people's mind
as his own."

674
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:03,630
Mencius said,

675
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:06,080
"The people are the priority,
the state second,

676
00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:07,190
the ruler is the least important."

677
00:41:07,670 --> 00:41:08,670
Xunzi also said,

678
00:41:08,870 --> 00:41:10,630
"The ruler is the boat,

679
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:12,470
and the people are the water.

680
00:41:12,630 --> 00:41:14,390
Water can carry a boat or capsize it."

681
00:41:14,670 --> 00:41:15,470
In the sage's books,

682
00:41:15,470 --> 00:41:16,800
there are ways to govern,

683
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:17,950
and principles for a stable state.

684
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:19,910
But to truly understand their meaning,

685
00:41:19,910 --> 00:41:21,560
one must to be an official

686
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:22,760
to govern a region.

687
00:41:23,390 --> 00:41:25,840
Only then can one know
the weight of the people,

688
00:41:25,870 --> 00:41:27,120
and the people's suffering.

689
00:41:27,390 --> 00:41:28,520
If you read the sages' texts

690
00:41:28,710 --> 00:41:29,800
but do not apply them to practical use,

691
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:31,120
it is just talk without action,

692
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:32,320
and it's hard to grasp the true meaning.

693
00:41:32,710 --> 00:41:34,630
Even if you study
for ten years through hardships,

694
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:36,520
it would all be in vain.

695
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:37,870
Good.

696
00:41:39,630 --> 00:41:40,360
Sir,

697
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:42,630
what's the use of studying the sages?

698
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,840
Is it just for fame and wealth?

699
00:41:45,190 --> 00:41:46,000
Good question.

700
00:41:47,950 --> 00:41:48,950
What's the use of studying?

701
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,430
Today, I'll tell you all.

702
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:51,600
Reading the sages' texts

703
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:52,000
can lead

704
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,840
to a hundred or a thousand pursuits.

705
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:55,840
But it cannot be just
for fame and wealth.

706
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,670
A true man, born in this world,

707
00:41:57,670 --> 00:41:59,470
is meant for great responsibilities.

708
00:41:59,630 --> 00:42:00,870
He should have lofty ambitions,

709
00:42:00,870 --> 00:42:02,520
endure hardships, and achieve greatness,

710
00:42:02,630 --> 00:42:04,190
making a name in history.

711
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:06,000
Never waste your youth

712
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:07,320
by just living to survive.

713
00:42:10,390 --> 00:42:11,470
Today, I'm lucky

714
00:42:11,710 --> 00:42:13,710
to see you teach the students.

715
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:15,840
You truly have a remarkable presence

716
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:16,950
and are truly a pillar of talent.

717
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:19,280
You're teasing me again.

718
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:20,710
I wouldn't dare.

719
00:42:21,630 --> 00:42:23,360
I didn't expect the riverside

720
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:25,190
to be so peaceful and pleasant.

721
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:27,430
Do you like it?

722
00:42:27,710 --> 00:42:29,600
In the future,
I'll come with you more often.

723
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:32,390
You are the magistrate.

724
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:34,120
The livelihoods of the people

725
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:35,120
depend on you.

726
00:42:36,230 --> 00:42:37,670
I do not expect
to be with you every moment.

727
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:40,360
I just want to cherish the present.

728
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:46,470
"If love between both sides
can last for aye,

729
00:42:47,150 --> 00:42:48,710
Why need they
stay together night and day?"

730
00:42:50,150 --> 00:42:51,230
Compared to that,

731
00:42:51,230 --> 00:42:52,390
I prefer this line:

732
00:42:52,430 --> 00:42:54,120
"When Autumn's Golden wind
embraces Dew of Jades,

733
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:56,080
All the love scenes on earth,
however many, fade."
