[Episode 7]

4
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:34,760
Tell me what really happened.

5
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:36,190
If you didn't commit murder,

6
00:01:36,190 --> 00:01:37,870
you can explain it to yamen.

7
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:41,440
But I can't...

8
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:45,270
Grab your stuff and flee.

9
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,760
Come on, leave.

10
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:49,720
Where to go, Mother?

11
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:50,550
They haven't wanted

12
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:51,550
you yet.

13
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:52,760
Leave Linfen now.

14
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:54,120
How will you make a living if I leave?

15
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,480
I can't leave you alone.

16
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:56,510
Don't worry about me.

17
00:01:56,510 --> 00:01:57,870
I can live on my own.

18
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:58,950
You must stay alive.

19
00:01:58,950 --> 00:01:59,950
That's all I want.

20
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:02,000
Leave. Leave now!

21
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:02,950
Hurry!

22
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:06,440
Mother,

23
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,110
sorry for this.

24
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:12,110
I'll come back

25
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:14,190
to take care of you
a couple of years later.

26
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,000
Feng Erlang, you can't leave.

27
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:18,630
Come with us.

28
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,080
Come!

29
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:22,750
Erlang,

30
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:23,830
Erlang, run!

31
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,320
Run!

32
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:25,750
Mother!

33
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:26,320
Run, Erlang!

34
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,270
Go arrest him!

35
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:30,000
You can't go. Stop!

36
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:31,390
Don't fight here.

37
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:32,240
You women don't fight.

38
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,110
This is so rude.

39
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:34,190
Only we men fight.

40
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:35,110
Chase him!

41
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:36,550
Go, go, go.

42
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:37,670
Protect yourself.

43
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:39,960
Don't go! Stop.

44
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:54,320
Stop!

45
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:56,470
Stop!

46
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:59,630
He is over there!

47
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:12,390
Look what you did!

48
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:12,880
Sorry.

49
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:13,830
Damn you!

50
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,320
Freeze!

51
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:23,270
Young Master.

52
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,080
Lian Shu, compensate her!

53
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,160
Compensate me!

54
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:50,880
Go!

55
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:08,240
Young Master.

56
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:08,670
Quick!

57
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:10,160
Get a rope to strap him. Come on!

58
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:11,550
Rope.

59
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:12,750
Young Master, be careful!

60
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,240
Hello.

61
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:17,640
Young Master, hang in there.

62
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,200
I can't!

63
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,320
Hang in there.

64
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,830
Can anyone give me a rope

65
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:24,070
to do us a favor?

66
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:25,600
We yamen officers
are arresting the suspect.

67
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:28,000
Please bring a rope here.

68
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:29,000
Here!

69
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:29,320
Where's the suspect?

70
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:29,880
Where is it?

71
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:30,950
It's in there.

72
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:31,830
Hurry!

73
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,270
Go, go, go.

74
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,440
Quick!

75
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,880
Tie him up tightly!

76
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:39,350
Make sure he can't escape.

77
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:41,440
Tie him up tightly!

78
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:42,760
Make sure he has no chance to escape.

79
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,070
Tie him up tightly!

80
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,640
Harder!

81
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:47,350
You tied the wrong one.

82
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:49,440
He's my Young Master.

83
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:50,550
Young Master, just a minute.

84
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:51,720
They'll untie you now.

85
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,070
Quick! Untie him!

86
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,350
Move aside!

87
00:04:56,550 --> 00:04:57,510
Quick, untie him!

88
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:58,790
Untie my Young Master.

89
00:04:58,790 --> 00:04:59,480
Untie him.

90
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,320
Do it now!

91
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,040
Hurry, do it.

92
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:03,040
Hurry.

93
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,760
Untie him. Come on.

94
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:06,390
Help me up!

95
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:07,790
Help me up please.

96
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:08,440
Go!

97
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:09,880
Hurry!

98
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:26,350
Young Master,

99
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:28,040
your clothes is dirty.

100
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:29,480
It's dusty.

101
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,480
Sorry for this, Young Master.

102
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,550
You pat me too harder.

103
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:43,110
Is your ankle okay?

104
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:44,440
I'm alright.

105
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,670
Here, come.

106
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:48,600
Why?

107
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,040
I'll carry you.

108
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:50,950
Come on up.

109
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,040
I'll walk.

110
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:53,920
You're injured.

111
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,160
Don't be stubborn. Let me carry you.

112
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,440
No need.

113
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,160
Come on.

114
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,480
Sir, stop.

115
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:05,160
Please stop.

116
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,270
Sir,

117
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:11,480

118
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:12,790

119
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,390
Come on up.

120
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:17,670
Thank you.

121
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,600
Come on, I'll help you.

122
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:24,880
You?

123
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,160
You can come up too.

124
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:32,920
Young Master.

125
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:39,440
Sit tight.

126
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:10,200
What happened to your hand?

127
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:12,200
It's okay. I'm fine.

128
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,000
Young Master.

129
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,790
You're badly hurt.

130
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:17,550
Just a small injury.

131
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:18,950
It's serious.

132
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:20,200
You're bleeding.

133
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,480
It doesn't matter.

134
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:22,600
Not need to get worried.

135
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,760
It's not a big deal.

136
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:29,070
Sir,

137
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,000

138
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,160
of your liquor?

139
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,200
Okay, just take it.

140
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:32,920
Thank you.

141
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:36,440
Lian Shu,

142
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:37,670
move your Young Master's hand

143
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:38,510
closer to me.

144
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,670
It hurts.

145
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:42,670
You've to endure it.

146
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,600
It's not a big deal.

147
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,270
Have my bones got hurt?

148
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:56,390
Stop!

149
00:07:57,230 --> 00:07:58,950
Just stop!

150
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:01,510
Don't touch it!

151
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,550
A small wound.

152
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:05,320
Eatting some nutritious food

153
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:06,600
will help you get recovered soon.

154
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:10,790
Gently please!

155
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:15,270
Gently,

156
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:19,230
please.

157
00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:24,600
You!

158
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:26,830
Thanks a lot.

159
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:38,790
Get off.

160
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:41,910
Come on.

161
00:08:41,910 --> 00:08:42,670
What are you doing?

162
00:08:42,710 --> 00:08:43,520
You ankle is sprained.

163
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:44,440
I'll help you come down.

164
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,000
Get away. Don't touch me.

165
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,080
Didn't you just touch my hand?

166
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:47,640
Don't worry.

167
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:24,760
Maintain order!

168
00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:31,710
Bring the suspect over.

169
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:41,960
Feng Erlang!

170
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:44,080
Why did you kill Meng Qiaosheng?

171
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,150
I didn't kill him.

172
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:48,030
You rented a boat five days ago,

173
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:50,710
killed him on it,
threw his body in the river

174
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:51,910
and abandoned the boat.

175
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:53,110
Did you do it or not?

176
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:53,910
I didn't do it.

177
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,030
There was a witness

178
00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:56,520
of you renting the boat.

179
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:57,710
Yes, I rent it.

180
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,670
Renting it isn't against the law, is it?

181
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:04,080
And I didn't know Meng Qiaosheng.

182
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,880
Are you sure of that?

183
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,200
Then his hairpin was found

184
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,080
on the boat you rent?

185
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:19,150
I didn't kill him anyway.

186
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:20,640
So why were you running away

187
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:22,520
when you saw yamen officers?

188
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:24,520
I feared I couldn't explain clearly
what happened.

189
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:26,470
Your lie

190
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:28,320
proves you're guilty.

191
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:33,440
Yeah,

192
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,760
I rented the boat

193
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:37,590
and also met Meng Qiaosheng.

194
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:39,670
But I didn't kill him.

195
00:10:39,710 --> 00:10:41,470
Was he on your boat at that day?

196
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:41,910
Yes.

197
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:42,790
How come he was on it?

198
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:45,280
He got it on himself.

199
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,400
It's a lie!

200
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:54,550
I abducted him to the boat.

201
00:10:54,590 --> 00:10:55,440
Why did you do that?

202
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,710
Where did you abduct him?

203
00:10:59,000 --> 00:10:59,790
I don't know.

204
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:00,960
You don't now?

205
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:03,350
You know it as you killed him.

206
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:06,350
I didn't kill him!

207
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:09,470
I...

208
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:11,470
I punched him a few times.

209
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,350
Maybe I did it too hard.

210
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,150
I just kicked him.

211
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:15,960
Feng Erlang,

212
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:19,520
you beat him till he was badly injured

213
00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:21,350
and then threw this body into the river.

214
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:22,670
So you commited murder.

215
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:24,280
He jumped into it

216
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:26,080
and was fine when he swam away.

217
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,230
Feng Erlang,

218
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:38,590
so you've admitted

219
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:42,440
the kidnapping of Meng Qiaosheng.

220
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,710
And you beat him

221
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:46,110
and he fell into the water.

222
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,200
Is it true?

223
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:50,910
Yes.

224
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:53,440
Meng Qiaosheng died from drowning

225
00:11:53,710 --> 00:11:55,470
according to the examination
of the post-mortem examiner.

226
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,320
You kidnapped him to the boat,

227
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:59,470
so you're guilty of his death.

228
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:00,670
Do you stilll defend yourself?

229
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:06,880
No.

230
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:09,400
You'll be sentenced to death for murder.

231
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:13,000
Feng Erlang, you admit the crime, right?

232
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,080
Shall we close the case?

233
00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:32,110
Do you think it can be closed?

234
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:36,280
He already admitted it himself.

235
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,230
You're the the county magistrate.

236
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:39,710
Better not waste the time

237
00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:41,400
on this trivial case.

238
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:44,110
It won't waste the time.

239
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:45,840
What do you think about the case?

240
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:48,670
Feng Erlang hid

241
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:49,910
the most critical information.

242
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:51,230
Yes.

243
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:53,840
It must be very important to him.

244
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,080
To conceal it,

245
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,960
he even committed the murder.

246
00:12:57,150 --> 00:12:58,640
We need to find out

247
00:12:58,640 --> 00:12:59,320
where he kidnapped

248
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,550
Meng Qiaosheng.

249
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:01,470
Then

250
00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:02,840
the truth will be revealed.

251
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:06,200
He has admitted the crime.

252
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,150
Why do you exculpate for him?

253
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:11,880
What do you think?

254
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:13,880
Feng Erlang and Meng Qiaosheng

255
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:15,230
had the feud

256
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:17,000
because of Meing Hongying.

257
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,200
We need to find the clue

258
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,910
from her.

259
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:32,910
You!

260
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,000
Why are you wearing a dress?

261
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:39,960
Oh, are you

262
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,320
going to...

263
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,030
I'm going to
the Mei family's house on the case.

264
00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:44,760
No need to go with me.

265
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,440
I'm going to meet
the womenfolk of their family.

266
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,550
So I wear the dress

267
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:49,520
as the maid of Mr. Han.

268
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:51,440
You're a man.

269
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,080
It's improper for you to come.

270
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:52,790
Oh, no.

271
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,440
You go there as a maid.

272
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:57,320
I can go as a servant.

273
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:05,880
Young Master, better not do this.

274
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:07,440
My clothes size is smaller.

275
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:17,910
Watch your words and behave yourself

276
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:19,350
at their home.

277
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:20,200
No worries.

278
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,710
I'll keep silent.

279
00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:40,350
Who are you?

280
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:42,030
We are servants

281
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:43,230
of yamen.

282
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,080
Wanna inquire of Mei Hongying

283
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,280
about something.

284
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:46,150
Hongying?

285
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:47,670
What's the matter?

286
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,000
Is she at home?

287
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,440
She can't meet you now.

288
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:56,440
Honey!

289
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:58,440
What's up?

290
00:14:58,910 --> 00:14:59,960
What are you doing? Hongying!

291
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:01,590
Honey!

292
00:15:01,590 --> 00:15:02,000
What's up?

293
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:02,670
Honey!

294
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:04,550
Where are you going?

295
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:06,030
Where's Erlang? I'll go find him.

296
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:07,030
Don't go.

297
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:07,590
Go back to your room.

298
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:08,640
Release me!

299
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:09,590
Why did you let her out?

300
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:10,790
She wanted to drink water.

301
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:11,640
I was bringing it to her.

302
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:13,150
But she ran out
the moment I opened the door.

303
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:14,470
Let me go!

304
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:15,350
Is your head alright?

305
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:17,440
It got hit by the door.

306
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,320
Apologize to her!

307
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,590
No! Let me go.

308
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:20,110
Don't go.

309
00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:21,590
I do this for your own good.

310
00:15:23,470 --> 00:15:25,880
Excuse me, are you Mei Hongying?

311
00:15:28,030 --> 00:15:29,550
Yes, I am. Who you are?

312
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:31,470
We're from yarmen.

313
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:33,790
Wanna ask you something.

314
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:36,200
Why?

315
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,590
You just mentioned Erlang.

316
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:44,400
Do you mean Feng Erlang?

317
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:46,440
You know him?

318
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:48,550
What happened to him?

319
00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:50,200
He's

320
00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:52,000
the suspect of a murder case.

321
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:55,470
Murder case?

322
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:57,550
Impossible.

323
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,280
A body was found

324
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:00,760
in Fen River.

325
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:03,640
We found the dead is Meng Qiaosheng.

326
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:06,110
And the suspect is Feng Erlang.

327
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:09,150
No way.

328
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:10,590
Never will Erlang kill anyone.

329
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,030
I've heard

330
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:14,550
the two of them are your suitors.

331
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:16,230
Do you know anything about the case?

332
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:17,150
I...

333
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:18,030
Nonsense!

334
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:19,110
Some people always

335
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:20,640
bad-mouth my family.

336
00:16:20,710 --> 00:16:22,150
She doesn't know them,

337
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:22,840
okay?

338
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:23,520
Go inside.

339
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:24,760
Don't touch me.

340
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:25,760
Is Erlang

341
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:26,880
arrested by you?

342
00:16:26,910 --> 00:16:27,880
Take me to see him.

343
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:29,000
Never will he kill anyone.

344
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:30,790
He has admitted

345
00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:32,080
kidnapping Meng Qiaosheng

346
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:33,080
and beat him too.

347
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:34,910
If there is no new evidence,

348
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:36,350
we can only assume

349
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:38,200
Meng Qiaosheng died because of him.

350
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:39,880
Impossible.

351
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:42,470
Erlang has no grudge against Mr. Meng.

352
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:43,550
They have no relationship at all.

353
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:44,960
Erlang couldn't have killed him.

354
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:50,080
We asked Feng Erlang

355
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:51,790
to tell us the truth

356
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:53,470
if he didn't kill him.

357
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:55,640
But he hasn't said anything about it.

358
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:57,760
If he still refuses to talk about it,

359
00:16:58,550 --> 00:16:59,840
he'll

360
00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:02,000
be charged of murder.

361
00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:05,590
Please take me to see him.

362
00:17:05,590 --> 00:17:07,310
I have a lot to say to him.

363
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:14,190
Now he's on death row.

364
00:17:15,430 --> 00:17:16,920
You'll never see him again

365
00:17:24,190 --> 00:17:25,040
unless you...

366
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:28,160
What?

367
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:29,800
Unless you testify

368
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:32,000
for him in the trial.

369
00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:33,310
Then I'll do that.

370
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,760
No!

371
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:35,880
You are unmarried.

372
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,160
You'll be gossiped about.

373
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:37,950
Go back to the room.

374
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:40,110
I don't care! I'm going there.

375
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:40,680
You!

376
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:41,310
Let's go!

377
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:43,800
Come back!

378
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:47,680
Court trial starts!

379
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:52,830
[People's Court ]
Maintain order!

380
00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:04,640
Bring the suspect.

381
00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:10,040
Hongying!

382
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:15,920
What the hell did you do?

383
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:18,070
I've never even spoken to Mr. Meng.

384
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:19,400
Why did you kidnap him?

385
00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:21,280
Why do you cause the trouble?

386
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,560
You were supposed
to take me away that day.

387
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:29,160
Why did you stand me up?

388
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:30,760
Why?

389
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:32,520
Why would you lie to me?

390
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:33,560
I didn't stand you up.

391
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:34,800
Stop denying!

392
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,040
I'd been waiting for you
all night that day.

393
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:41,830
And many days have passed.

394
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:43,280
Yet you didn't even come, okay?

395
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:47,160
Feng Erlang,

396
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:48,950
you mean

397
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:50,800
you went to the Mei family
that night.

398
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:51,800
Then why didn't you

399
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,280
meet Mei Hongying?

400
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,640
And how did you kidnap Meng Qiaosheng?

401
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:00,880
Speak.

402
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:02,760
Speak!

403
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:05,950
Feng Erlang,

404
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:07,920
I'm gonna ask you again.

405
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,070
Did you beat Meng Qiaosheng?

406
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:15,880
I did.

407
00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:16,950
Was his face wounded

408
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:18,800
by your beating?

409
00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:22,350
Yes, perhaps. I can't remember.

410
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:23,640
Where did you abduct him

411
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:25,310
and why did you beat him?

412
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:30,640
Say it.

413
00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:32,880
Feng Erlang,

414
00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:34,760
this is

415
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:36,560
your last chance to defend.

416
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,000
If you don't tell us

417
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,040
the truth,

418
00:19:39,310 --> 00:19:40,470
or have new evidence

419
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:41,000
to prove

420
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,190
you didn't kill him,

421
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:45,520
you'll be sentenced to death

422
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:46,880
in obedience to the law.

423
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:51,520
Say something.

424
00:19:53,470 --> 00:19:54,350
I'll support you

425
00:19:54,350 --> 00:19:55,760
no matter what happened.

426
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:57,070
You may be sentenced to death.

427
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:58,470
Say something please!

428
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,350
There are witness

429
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,800
and evidence

430
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:07,680
against Feng Erland.

431
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:09,230
Feng Erlang said he was not guilty

432
00:20:09,230 --> 00:20:10,830
but couldn't prove his innocence.

433
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:12,280
I delcare he is

434
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:14,590
sentenced to death

435
00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:17,350
and will be taken
to Ministry of Justice after ten days

436
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,590
and be executed.

437
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:24,830
The trial is conclueded.

438
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:26,920
Hongying.

439
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:29,590
Hongying.

440
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:30,280
Erlang.

441
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:30,920
Hongying!

442
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:31,640
Erlang.

443
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:32,830
Hongying!

444
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,070
Miss Luo,

445
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:39,680
please help Erlang.

446
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,350
He wouldn't kill anyone.

447
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,040
You believe he didn't kill.

448
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:44,920
I believe him.

449
00:20:45,430 --> 00:20:46,230
Miss Luo,

450
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:47,710
Erlang is

451
00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:48,710
a rough man

452
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:50,350
but very kind-hearted.

453
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,190
I grew up with him.

454
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:53,590
I know him very well.

455
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:54,920
So he must be innocent.

456
00:20:56,110 --> 00:20:57,830
He might not kill him.

457
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,350
But he wouldn't explain what happened.

458
00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:00,880
To find out the truth

459
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:01,920
in ten days

460
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:03,350
isn't an easy task.

461
00:21:04,190 --> 00:21:05,880
He must have been threatened

462
00:21:06,590 --> 00:21:08,190
or there is something he can't say.

463
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:09,680
So he can't tell the truth

464
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:10,560
to the magistrate.

465
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:12,190
I believe he wouldn't kill anyone.

466
00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:14,070
Please help him!

467
00:21:14,070 --> 00:21:15,280
Stand up please, Hongying.

468
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:19,830
I promise you

469
00:21:20,590 --> 00:21:21,950
to try my best to find out the truth

470
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,520
before he is taken
to the Ministry of Justice.

471
00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:27,040
But you have to support me.

472
00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:28,880
Sure.

473
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,110
Could you please

474
00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:42,070
plead the officers

475
00:21:42,350 --> 00:21:44,020
not to let others know
that Hongying testifying

476
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:44,920
in the trial today?

477
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:47,110
Don't worry.

478
00:21:47,430 --> 00:21:48,920
Before Hongying came,

479
00:21:49,070 --> 00:21:50,640
the magistrate
had ordered everyone in the court

480
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:51,760
to keep everything

481
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,160
as a secret.

482
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,760
Thank you for your efforts

483
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,350
to protect Hongying's name.

484
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:00,880
By the way,

485
00:22:01,230 --> 00:22:02,920
were both of you at home

486
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:04,560
at that night five days ago?

487
00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:06,230
Five days ago?

488
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:10,430
My wife went back to her mother's house.

489
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:12,590
I was working in the workshop all night.

490
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:15,310
I'm leaving.

491
00:22:16,430 --> 00:22:17,310
Bye.

492
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,190
Coming.

493
00:22:35,710 --> 00:22:37,110
The delicious and warm

494
00:22:37,110 --> 00:22:38,350
white fungus soup with lotus seeds.

495
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,800
My wife made it for you.

496
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,160
Drink some

497
00:22:43,310 --> 00:22:44,520
while it's warm.

498
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,520
It's your favorite date.

499
00:22:48,310 --> 00:22:49,880
Eat one.

500
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:52,110
Don't pretend it here.

501
00:22:56,430 --> 00:22:57,880
I just want you eat some food.

502
00:23:05,190 --> 00:23:06,920
Erlang is about to be executed.

503
00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:08,950
You are happy

504
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,040
to see it, right?

505
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,680
Relax.

506
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:18,280
Sit down.

507
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:19,800
Just sit down. Okay?

508
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:26,830
Hongying, you know what?

509
00:23:27,470 --> 00:23:29,710
Erlang's choice to murder

510
00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:32,310
hows he never cared about you.

511
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,310
Why do you still

512
00:23:34,310 --> 00:23:35,310
care about him?

513
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:37,040
Erlang didn't kill anyone.

514
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:38,710
He's innocent.

515
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,590
Silly girl.

516
00:23:42,710 --> 00:23:44,000
You don't even care about your name

517
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,040
to stand up for him.

518
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:47,350
Is it worth it?

519
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:48,040
Certainly yes!

520
00:23:48,950 --> 00:23:50,760
You're vain,

521
00:23:51,070 --> 00:23:51,880
look down on Erlang,

522
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:53,430
and keep us from being together.

523
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:54,760
All of this got him

524
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:56,000
into this trouble.

525
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:58,920
You earned some money,

526
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:00,040
and married
a First-Degree Scholar's daughter.

527
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:01,040
Now you think

528
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:01,760
you're noble?

529
00:24:02,470 --> 00:24:03,520
You were poor before.

530
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,110
Don't you remember?

531
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:06,760
Just because

532
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:08,430
I was once poor,

533
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,590
I know how miserable it is

534
00:24:10,590 --> 00:24:11,880
to live

535
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:12,800
in poverty.

536
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:15,470
I don't want you marry a poor guy.

537
00:24:17,230 --> 00:24:18,110
I know

538
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,470
you and Erlang grew up together.

539
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:21,230
I can understand

540
00:24:21,230 --> 00:24:23,230
you two have feelings for each other.

541
00:24:23,230 --> 00:24:25,640
But that's not enough.

542
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:28,160
You need money

543
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,760
to make a living.

544
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:31,680
If you marry him,

545
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:32,950
with his mere wages,

546
00:24:32,950 --> 00:24:33,920
to support your life,

547
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:35,070
you may

548
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:36,880
even suffer starvation.

549
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:39,590
When you have kids,

550
00:24:39,950 --> 00:24:41,640
they'll grow up in that poor area.

551
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,430
That's what you want?

552
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Changxiong, I want to know

553
00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:50,430
if Erlang

554
00:24:50,430 --> 00:24:52,000
came to our house that night.

555
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,430
I don't know, okay?

556
00:24:56,350 --> 00:24:57,160
I was working

557
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:58,800
in the workshop all night.

558
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:00,640
But Erlang said he came here.

559
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:02,470
He wouldn't

560
00:25:02,470 --> 00:25:03,920
lie to me.

561
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:06,640
I know something must happen.

562
00:25:08,110 --> 00:25:09,520
No need to overthink it.

563
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,400
The magistrate will find it out.

564
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:16,070
I'll get you another bowl of soup.

565
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:18,310
Ten days.

566
00:25:20,590 --> 00:25:22,760
It's only ten days away.

567
00:25:49,190 --> 00:25:50,520
Shu,

568
00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:54,400
you are hungry?

569
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:56,800
Wait.

570
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:08,160
They're cold.

571
00:26:08,190 --> 00:26:09,560
I'll go heat them up.

572
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:12,160
I can help you.

573
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,350
Shu,

574
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:19,190
how come you wanna bake the buns?

575
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:20,590
When I was little,

576
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:22,350
I loved to eat baked buns.

577
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:32,710
Mr. Luo, you're back.

578
00:26:32,710 --> 00:26:33,160
Have a good business.

579
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:36,560
Steamed buns.

580
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:38,070
Hot steamed buns.

581
00:26:39,350 --> 00:26:40,800
Sir, I wants two buns.

582
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:41,680
Okay.

583
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:49,830
Father.

584
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,280
I was working the case
and passing by

585
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:15,190
the Mei family's house this morning.

586
00:27:15,230 --> 00:27:16,800
Noticed Mei Hongying testifying
in the court

587
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:18,470
has been known by the neighborhood.

588
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:20,430
They said

589
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:21,520
she hook up with Feng Erlang

590
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:22,430
and Meng Qiaosheng.

591
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:23,800
The two of them got jealous

592
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:24,710
and started to fight.

593
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:26,160
And then Meng Qiaosheng was found dead.

594
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,000
I ordered everyone in the court
to keep it a secret.

595
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:30,470
I confirmed with our men

596
00:27:30,470 --> 00:27:31,640
that they didn't leak it out.

597
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:33,560
But no one saw me

598
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:34,350
going out

599
00:27:34,350 --> 00:27:35,560
from their home.

600
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:37,230
And I was wearing a dress.

601
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:38,560
Even if someone saw it,

602
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:39,110
they wouldn't know

603
00:27:39,110 --> 00:27:40,160
I'm from yamen.

604
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:43,000
I think I got the clue.

605
00:27:44,590 --> 00:27:45,760
The Mei family is related to it.

606
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:49,110
I'll go inquire them with you again.

607
00:27:56,070 --> 00:27:57,280
You honor, you don't

608
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:58,590
have to go there.

609
00:27:59,110 --> 00:27:59,920
Why?

610
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:02,680
The two of you went there
as a maid and a servant.

611
00:28:04,070 --> 00:28:05,710
I can go as a yamen adviser.

612
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:13,830
Sir, here is your shumai.

613
00:28:16,430 --> 00:28:17,350
Looks like Baozi needs

614
00:28:17,350 --> 00:28:18,760
to improve her cooking skills.

615
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:19,920
You're still starving.

616
00:28:21,070 --> 00:28:21,880
It's not like that.

617
00:28:22,710 --> 00:28:23,880
Let's go.

618
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:25,950
The lamb shumai

619
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:27,520
smells so good.

620
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,680
If you want to eat,

621
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:30,680
we can go

622
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:31,590
eat some.

623
00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:33,710
Better not. We're on the case.

624
00:28:42,310 --> 00:28:44,430
Actually,

625
00:28:44,710 --> 00:28:45,880
I'm good at making shumai.

626
00:28:47,710 --> 00:28:48,520
Really?

627
00:28:49,190 --> 00:28:50,680
If you want to eat them,

628
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:51,880
I'll make some for you.

629
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:55,000
I didn't expect you could cook.

630
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:57,470
When I was 12,

631
00:28:57,470 --> 00:28:58,640
I worked in Mingke House.

632
00:28:58,800 --> 00:28:59,590
Before that

633
00:28:59,590 --> 00:29:01,590
I worked as a maid in a big family.

634
00:29:01,590 --> 00:29:03,400
Learned some cooking skills.

635
00:29:04,110 --> 00:29:05,160
What about

636
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:06,230
when you were little?

637
00:29:08,710 --> 00:29:10,920
Home-brewed Fen Liquor.

638
00:29:11,230 --> 00:29:12,560
Take a look.

639
00:29:15,470 --> 00:29:16,310
I indeed

640
00:29:16,310 --> 00:29:18,190
wanted to eat shumai just now.

641
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:22,800
Please cook some for me.

642
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:24,110
Okay.

643
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:26,520
Hongying did it.

644
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:27,760
Why can't I talk about it?

645
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:28,400
And,

646
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:29,830
I told the truth.

647
00:29:29,830 --> 00:29:31,230
Am I right, everyone?

648
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:32,590
Yeah, that's right.

649
00:29:32,710 --> 00:29:33,920
Hongying didn't do that!

650
00:29:34,190 --> 00:29:35,350
You always slander her,

651
00:29:35,350 --> 00:29:36,310
you gossip monger!

652
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:38,400
Don't you dare speak ill of her!

653
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,680
Hongying is a slut!

654
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:39,950
Yeah, she's a slut.

655
00:29:39,950 --> 00:29:40,640
What?

656
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:41,110
She's a slut!

657
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:41,640
She's a slut.

658
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:42,950
I'll tear your tongue off!

659
00:29:42,950 --> 00:29:44,110
Hands off!

660
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:46,760
Help me!

661
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:48,190
Stop!

662
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:50,920
He's bullying me.

663
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:53,760
You're just in time.

664
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:55,640
Why did you leak out the news

665
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:56,800
of Hongying testifying in the court?

666
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:59,920
We didn't.

667
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:00,880
But they...

668
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:07,160
You two go to yamen

669
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:08,590
and explain to me
who told you the gossip later.

670
00:30:09,230 --> 00:30:10,160
Oh, we'll never

671
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:11,400
gossip about it.

672
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:12,160
We dare not

673
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:13,070
do this again.

674
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:13,920
Go.

675
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:16,310
Don't go! Tell me why you said that!

676
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:18,920
Go, go.

677
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:20,880
We ordered everyone
in the court to keep it secret.

678
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:23,230
And Captain Cai
confirmed with them many times.

679
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:24,560
None of the workers in yamen

680
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:26,190
will leak it out.

681
00:30:26,190 --> 00:30:27,680
I can guarantee that.

682
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:29,110
Who else would do that?

683
00:30:29,710 --> 00:30:30,590
Do you have

684
00:30:31,430 --> 00:30:32,430
any servants?

685
00:30:33,310 --> 00:30:34,400
We have two before.

686
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:35,880
A maidservant

687
00:30:35,950 --> 00:30:37,280
has been away for over two months.

688
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:38,880
And a long-term hired laborer

689
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,400
was taken by him
to the workshop to work

690
00:30:40,430 --> 00:30:41,160
and hasn't been back

691
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:42,110
for over a month.

692
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:45,430
Have you two

693
00:30:45,430 --> 00:30:46,430
ever talked about that to outsiders?

694
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:47,710
No.

695
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,400
It's harmful to Hongying's name.

696
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:50,560
How could we possibly

697
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:51,710
talk about it with an outsider?

698
00:30:52,190 --> 00:30:53,400
What do you mean?

699
00:30:54,070 --> 00:30:54,800
Do you suspect

700
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:56,070
someone in my family leak it out?

701
00:30:56,190 --> 00:30:57,400
Or my wife and I

702
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:58,520
try to harm Hongying?

703
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:00,040
We just want to ask you to know more,

704
00:31:00,070 --> 00:31:01,400
not suspecting you.

705
00:31:01,710 --> 00:31:02,520
Changxiong.

706
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:04,590
Changxiong.

707
00:31:10,190 --> 00:31:10,880
Your Honor.

708
00:31:14,070 --> 00:31:15,070
Are you the magistrate?

709
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,470
Sorry for our

710
00:31:18,470 --> 00:31:19,710
ignorance.

711
00:31:19,710 --> 00:31:20,560
Please forgive us.

712
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:26,520
It's all right. Stand up.

713
00:31:26,830 --> 00:31:28,590
I wear casual clothes today.

714
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:30,280
Your Honor,

715
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,040
are there any new clues?

716
00:31:32,230 --> 00:31:33,400
You've found Erlang is innocent, right?

717
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:34,760
Hongying, stay cool.

718
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:35,920
We're looking into it,

719
00:31:35,950 --> 00:31:37,430
but haven't got new clues yet.

720
00:31:38,310 --> 00:31:39,110
Stay cool?

721
00:31:39,710 --> 00:31:40,830
How could I stay cool?

722
00:31:41,310 --> 00:31:42,710
Erlang will be executed soon!

723
00:31:43,430 --> 00:31:44,230
Your Honor,

724
00:31:44,430 --> 00:31:45,520
could I go visit him please?

725
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:47,710
Death row must be cold and damp.

726
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:49,280
I want to bring him bedclothes.

727
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:50,310
Hongying!

728
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:53,230
Don't cause trouble.

729
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:56,800
Your Honor,

730
00:31:57,310 --> 00:31:58,430
Hongying's name has been harmed

731
00:31:58,430 --> 00:31:59,560
after testifying

732
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:00,520
in the trial.

733
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:02,280
Please stop her
from going to death row again.

734
00:32:03,590 --> 00:32:05,430
Your Honor, please let me go.

735
00:32:05,430 --> 00:32:06,710
I must go to see him.

736
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:08,350
Please!

737
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:40,880
Erlang.

738
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:44,070
Erlang.

739
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:47,000
Erlang.

740
00:32:47,710 --> 00:32:48,400
Hongying.

741
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:55,230
Could you let me in please?

742
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:56,310
It's already

743
00:32:56,310 --> 00:32:57,680
an exception for you to come.

744
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:02,310
Are you all right?

745
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:07,560
Here.

746
00:33:08,470 --> 00:33:10,070
I brought your favorite food.

747
00:33:14,230 --> 00:33:15,230
No rush!

748
00:33:18,350 --> 00:33:19,920
Eat carefully.

749
00:33:24,470 --> 00:33:25,280
Just eat it.

750
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:27,590
Then

751
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:29,000
please tell us

752
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,350
the truth.

753
00:33:30,710 --> 00:33:31,950
I'll clear you of all suspicion.

754
00:33:39,430 --> 00:33:40,230
Eat more.

755
00:33:42,430 --> 00:33:43,230
No?

756
00:33:44,950 --> 00:33:46,560
Okay, I'll put it away.

757
00:33:47,590 --> 00:33:48,520
You can speak.

758
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:51,880
What could I say?

759
00:33:52,070 --> 00:33:53,280
What are you hiding?

760
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:55,160
and why do you hide it?

761
00:33:55,710 --> 00:33:57,310
You were supposed
to come to meet you that day.

762
00:33:57,470 --> 00:33:58,590
But why did you kidnap him?

763
00:34:01,190 --> 00:34:02,470
I have nothing to say.

764
00:34:05,230 --> 00:34:06,040
Erlang,

765
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:07,950
Miss Luo is kind.

766
00:34:08,150 --> 00:34:09,230
I trust her.

767
00:34:09,230 --> 00:34:10,470
She's helping us.

768
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:13,150
Erlang,

769
00:34:13,430 --> 00:34:14,600
what the hell are you hiding?

770
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:15,520
Say it!

771
00:34:15,630 --> 00:34:16,470
Why didn't you

772
00:34:16,470 --> 00:34:17,390
tell the truth to the magistrate?

773
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:21,360
I did it for you.

774
00:34:21,870 --> 00:34:22,800
For me?

775
00:34:23,910 --> 00:34:24,840
Explain to me.

776
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,190
Why you said you did it for me?

777
00:34:26,630 --> 00:34:28,710
You are the one who stood me up.

778
00:34:28,710 --> 00:34:29,520
Nonsense!

779
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:30,630
I'd been waiting

780
00:34:30,630 --> 00:34:31,760
for you all night.

781
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:32,800
Yet you didn't show up.

782
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:34,470
Why did you go kidnap Meng Qiaosheng?

783
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:35,710
If I hadn't been to your home,

784
00:34:35,710 --> 00:34:36,710
I couldn't have kidnapped him

785
00:34:36,710 --> 00:34:37,840
from your bed!

786
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:40,430
What?

787
00:34:41,870 --> 00:34:42,870
From my bed?

788
00:34:45,190 --> 00:34:46,040
No way!

789
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:48,000
Never would he be in my bed!

790
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:48,910
I didn't expect

791
00:34:48,910 --> 00:34:49,670
you're a liar!

792
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:50,760
I'm not lying.

793
00:34:53,710 --> 00:34:54,520
Hongying,

794
00:34:55,470 --> 00:34:56,190
Changxiong

795
00:34:56,190 --> 00:34:57,520
locked you in the study that night.

796
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:59,190
You never went back to your room,

797
00:34:59,190 --> 00:34:59,870
right?

798
00:35:01,870 --> 00:35:02,710
So you didn't even know

799
00:35:02,710 --> 00:35:04,080
if Meng Qiaosheng

800
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:05,190
was in your bed

801
00:35:05,190 --> 00:35:07,080
or not. right?

802
00:35:07,470 --> 00:35:08,280
Yes.

803
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,760
But it was not possible

804
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:11,910
for him to be in my bed.

805
00:35:12,150 --> 00:35:12,600
Get it.

806
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,040
Feng Erlang, go on.

807
00:35:17,870 --> 00:35:18,670
Speak.

808
00:35:19,390 --> 00:35:20,280
All right.

809
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:22,120
That night

810
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:24,230
I asked Niu and San...

811
00:35:27,950 --> 00:35:28,560
Here it is.

812
00:35:28,630 --> 00:35:29,520
Let's go then.

813
00:35:31,190 --> 00:35:33,280
What's up?

814
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:34,000
We can climb the wall.

815
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:35,360
No need.

816
00:35:39,190 --> 00:35:40,910
It's...

817
00:35:41,190 --> 00:35:42,910
Hongying doesn't lock the door.

818
00:35:42,910 --> 00:35:44,000
I forget it.

819
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:06,040
Hongying, I'm here to take you away.

820
00:36:13,230 --> 00:36:13,840
Niu.

821
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:15,430
Coming.

822
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:16,320
Lend me a hand.

823
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:17,600
You can't carry on your own?

824
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:19,800
Let me help you.

825
00:36:22,670 --> 00:36:23,600
Be careful.

826
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:25,230
She is too heavy.

827
00:36:25,230 --> 00:36:26,000
Come on.

828
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:36,150
Put it under Changxiong's door.

829
00:36:36,150 --> 00:36:36,870
Okay.

830
00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:47,360
I didn't expect we could succeed easily.

831
00:36:47,470 --> 00:36:48,280
Hongying.

832
00:36:48,950 --> 00:36:50,120
Hongying,

833
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:51,320
we came out.

834
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:53,230
Hongying, say something.

835
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,630
She must be shy.

836
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:57,120
- Go.
- Go.

837
00:37:06,430 --> 00:37:07,230
Hongying.

838
00:37:09,470 --> 00:37:10,280
Hongying.

839
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:12,230
Hongying!

840
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:14,870
She must feel shy!

841
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:19,670
Hongying,

842
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:21,390
you can come out.

843
00:37:26,430 --> 00:37:27,390
Meng Qiaosheng!

844
00:37:32,950 --> 00:37:34,710
Who are you?

845
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:36,320
How come I'm here?

846
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:39,230
Why are you in her bed?

847
00:37:39,950 --> 00:37:40,950
What did you do to Ying?

848
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:42,470
What did you do to Ying?

849
00:37:42,670 --> 00:37:43,600
I have no idea!

850
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:44,390
Where is Hongying?

851
00:37:44,870 --> 00:37:45,560
Where is she?

852
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:46,190
I have no idea!

853
00:37:46,190 --> 00:37:46,870
Where is she?

854
00:37:46,870 --> 00:37:48,150
What did you do to her?

855
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:50,040
What happened?

856
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:51,600
What did you do?

857
00:37:51,950 --> 00:37:54,080
Where's she?

858
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:55,280
Speak!

859
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:05,080
Where's she?

860
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:09,320
That's what happened.

861
00:38:10,430 --> 00:38:11,950
I promise

862
00:38:11,950 --> 00:38:13,080
everything I said is true!

863
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:16,520
How is that even possible?

864
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:19,710
This is so strange.

865
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:20,950
Then why didn't you

866
00:38:20,950 --> 00:38:21,950
go ask her afterwards?

867
00:38:22,150 --> 00:38:22,800
Yeah?

868
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,040
I went there every day.

869
00:38:24,670 --> 00:38:26,040
But the gate

870
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:27,800
was always closed.

871
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:30,080
Hongying.

872
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:32,320
Tell me.

873
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:36,710
Why was Meng Qiaosheng naked

874
00:38:36,710 --> 00:38:37,390
in your bed?

875
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:38,840
I...

876
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:40,360
I don't know.

877
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:40,840
I was locked

878
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:42,080
in the study by Changxiong.

879
00:38:43,630 --> 00:38:44,430
I can't believe

880
00:38:44,470 --> 00:38:45,760
what you wrote is so lame.

881
00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:48,190
If you don't study hard,

882
00:38:48,190 --> 00:38:50,150
you'll not be able

883
00:38:59,870 --> 00:39:00,670
to marry a good husband.

884
00:39:04,910 --> 00:39:06,230
You're not going anywhere.

885
00:39:06,430 --> 00:39:07,950
Stay in the study to copy it.

886
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:18,870
And concentrate.

887
00:39:20,390 --> 00:39:21,360
Copy a thousand ones!

888
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:24,630
A thousand copies.

889
00:39:25,230 --> 00:39:26,600
That's too many, Changxiong!

890
00:39:35,150 --> 00:39:35,950
Changxiong.

891
00:39:37,430 --> 00:39:38,080
Changxiong!

892
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:46,470
I can copy it,

893
00:39:46,470 --> 00:39:47,630
but don't lock the door.

894
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:49,710
If I don't do this, you will go out.

895
00:39:49,710 --> 00:39:51,230
I won't go out.

896
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:52,520
Don't go out until you finish copying.

897
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,150
You can't do this!

898
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:58,000
Changxiong!

899
00:39:58,800 --> 00:39:59,950
Open the door.

900
00:40:00,230 --> 00:40:01,430
Or I will burst the door open!

901
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:04,000
Do it then.

902
00:40:06,870 --> 00:40:09,000
Changxiong, open the door!

903
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:10,560
Changxiong!

904
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:12,280
This is bullying.

905
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:15,470
I'll manage to get out of here.

906
00:40:22,470 --> 00:40:23,230
Why did you also

907
00:40:23,230 --> 00:40:24,230
lock the windows?

908
00:40:28,870 --> 00:40:29,840
Changxiong!

909
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,000
Open it!

910
00:40:33,150 --> 00:40:34,120
Help me!

911
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:36,840
Changxiong and her wife

912
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:39,760
went out that night.

913
00:40:50,670 --> 00:40:52,600
Why don't you come?

914
00:41:06,390 --> 00:41:08,230
Why don't you come?

915
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:17,840
I didn't come out

916
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:19,190
until Changxiong came back

917
00:41:19,190 --> 00:41:20,360
from the workshop the next day.

918
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:22,280
I wanted to ask him

919
00:41:23,190 --> 00:41:24,230
if you had been here.

920
00:41:24,230 --> 00:41:25,360
So I tried to get the information
by asking him something else.

921
00:41:25,670 --> 00:41:26,840
But I spilled the beans

922
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:28,800
unintentionally that

923
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,280
you would come
to take me out secretly.

924
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:31,800
He got angry

925
00:41:31,950 --> 00:41:33,190
and locked me in again.

926
00:41:33,910 --> 00:41:35,040
But I didn't hear

927
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:35,670
anything happened

928
00:41:35,670 --> 00:41:36,710
that night.

929
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:38,000
Besides,

930
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:39,670
where is the letter?

931
00:41:40,190 --> 00:41:41,320
Where is it?

932
00:41:42,430 --> 00:41:43,390
What's the letter about?

933
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:47,390
I wrote the letter
to Changxiong for Erlang.

934
00:41:49,430 --> 00:41:50,710
It wrote

935
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:52,630
Erland would come to take me away.

936
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:54,470
And we would come

937
00:41:54,870 --> 00:41:56,120
to apologize to him after a period.

938
00:42:05,910 --> 00:42:06,560
Hands off!

939
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:07,950
Don't do this!

940
00:42:08,190 --> 00:42:09,000
What are you doing?

941
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:10,670
Erlang!

942
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:14,000
Hongying,

943
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:16,710
I got you wrong.

944
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:24,150
Hongying,

945
00:42:24,950 --> 00:42:26,630
Feng Erlang got you wrong.

946
00:42:27,150 --> 00:42:28,390
But he still

947
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:30,190
believes you.

948
00:42:31,190 --> 00:42:32,910
To protect your name,

949
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:35,520
he didn't tell the truth in the trial

950
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:37,520
even if he would be executed.

951
00:42:39,870 --> 00:42:40,630
Miss Luo,

952
00:42:41,390 --> 00:42:42,560
I beg you.

953
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:44,630
Please plead the magistrate for him.

954
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:46,710
He must be innocent.

955
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:49,150
Please help me.

956
00:42:49,910 --> 00:42:50,710
Rest assured.

957
00:42:51,470 --> 00:42:53,040
The magistrate won't
punish the wrong one.

958
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:55,800
But we have to get the evidence

959
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:57,910
to prove his innocence.
