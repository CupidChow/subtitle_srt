00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,080
No need, Qi Menglin.

5
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:37,310
I am truly disappointed in you.

6
00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:40,360
Luo Shu,

7
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:42,510
let's go meet my father now.

8
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:43,510
I'll show him

9
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:44,230
that the woman I want to marry

10
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:45,870
is the best in the world.

11
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:46,830
My father has always...

12
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:47,720
Why?

13
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:50,510
What does it
have to do with your father?

14
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:52,830
I am disappointed in you.

15
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:55,160
How are you gonna convince your father?

16
00:01:55,910 --> 00:01:56,950
Hunger strike?

17
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,040
Or waiting for someone's pity?

18
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:01,190
Look at you now.

19
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:02,270
I thought

20
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:03,550
after all these experiences,

21
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:04,720
you would have become a man

22
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:05,440
with responsibility

23
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,760
who could be relied on.

24
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:08,830
But now it seems

25
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:09,880
you're still

26
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,390
an immature coward.

27
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:12,880
Qi Menglin,

28
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:14,190
you're making me look down on you.

29
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:16,470
You said you wanted to protect me.

30
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:18,080
But when your father hit you,

31
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:18,910
you refused to eat and drink,

32
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:20,030
making a scene.

33
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:22,720
How are you gonna protect me?

34
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:23,630
With your

35
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:25,160
weak body?

36
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,800
I won't marry someone like you.

37
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,390
Lian Shu,

38
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:33,720
if he is

39
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,160
still like this,

40
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,470
you don't need to come and tell me.

41
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:39,550
I don't care if he wants to die.

Mr. Qin.

Sorry for disturbing you

51
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:37,270
Serve tea.

00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:41,960

53

Mr. Qin...

54

This is the
highest-quality Longjing this year.

55

Magistrate Han, try it.

56
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:53,630
Okay.

57
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,080
Good tea.

58
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:03,720
Thank you for your hospitality.

59
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,110
You're the guest of honor.

60
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:06,110
It's my pleasure,

61
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:07,190
of course.

62
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:10,030
Mr. Qin,

63
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,600
the reason for my visit

64
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,270
is that I wish to purchase some grain

65
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:15,720
from you.

66
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,550
Are you short of grain at home?

67
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,350
I'll send someone

68
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:22,070
to deliver a few dans to your mansion.

69
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:23,200
No.

70
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:25,640
Actually,

71
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:28,070
Linfen under my governance

72
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:29,200
has suffered from
a locust plague this year.

73
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,160
Tens of thousands of people
are starving.

74
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:33,390
So I've come here

75
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:34,550
to talk to you

76
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:35,720
about a deal.

77
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,200
Can you

78
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,670
sell me some grain?

79
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,070
You are indeed

80
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:44,950
Mr Liu's ideal son-in-law.

81
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
So generous.

82
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:49,200
Tens of thousands of dans of grain.

83
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:50,640
I do have that much.

84
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,270
But if you want to buy grain,

85
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:57,720
do you have enough money?

86
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,480
I can draft a loan acknowledgment

87
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,070
stamped with the official seal.

88
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:03,510
When the harvest comes next year,

89
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:05,160
I'll pay you back double.

90
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:07,480
I'm a merchant.

91
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:09,670
I only take money.

92
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:20,390
You know the relationship

93
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:21,480
between Mr. Liu and me.

94
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:23,440
You wouldn't turn down

95
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,270
Mr. Liu's favor, would you?

96
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,880
I would never

97
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,200
neglect Mr. Liu's favor.

98
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:33,920
However,

99
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:34,670
if you could ask Mr. Liu

100
00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:35,920
to inform me in person,

101
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,480
I would appreciate it.

102
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,510
I...

103
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:41,200
Is there any difficulty?

104
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:48,600
Or I can

105
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,110
give you some advice.

106
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,510
I'm all ears.

107
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:55,160
Ask Luo Shu to come for grain.

108
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:57,920
I know

109
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:01,760
that you two share a close friendship,

110
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,920
but you also know

111
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:06,200
that Luo Shu and I
have known each other since childhood,

112
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:07,640
like siblings.

113
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:09,510
If she's willing to come,

114
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,070
perhaps I could help you.

115
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:16,200
In that case,

116
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:20,200
I'll take my leave.

117
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:27,420
[Longtai Inn]

118
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:48,200
Your Honor.

119
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:50,880
Luo Shu.

120
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:53,670
You two at least eat something.

121
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:58,440
What have you got?

122
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:59,760
How's Mr. Qi?

123
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:10,390
Don't worry.

124
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:12,830
You know his character.

125
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:14,760
He won't fall so easily.

126
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:16,480
He'll recover soon.

127
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:17,670
I think so.

128
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:19,110
Mr. Qi

129
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:20,320
seems to be unreliable,

130
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:22,110
but he's quite dependable.

131
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:24,350
He has a chivalrous spirit.

132
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:27,670
What's your next plan?

133
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,040
I don't know yet.

134
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,480
We went to the countryside

135
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,390
and spent the whole day there.

136
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:34,950
The situation is
just the same as in the city.

137
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:36,270
People have no grain.

138
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,550
After returning back,

139
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:40,040
we went to the Qin family
to ask for grain.

140
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:40,920
However,

141
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:41,760
that guy

142
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:43,270
threatened us with the grain.

143
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:43,950
He even wanted you...

144
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:45,720
He even didn't want to sell to us.

145
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:58,070
It seems that we can't

146
00:07:58,070 --> 00:07:59,510
get grain from the people.

147
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:01,920
I'll go to see Mr. Liu tomorrow.

148
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:03,350
I'll make him
allocate relief grain to me,

149
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:04,600
no matter what.

150
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:06,670
Otherwise,

151
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,270
I'll have no face

152
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:09,880
to serve as the magistrate of Linfen.

153
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,230
Luo Shu, you don't know about it.

154
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:12,880
Magistrate Han and I

155
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:14,200
went to the countryside
to ask for grain.

156
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,230
Some people laughed at us,

157
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:16,230
some were hypocritical,

158
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:17,510
and some even thought we were frauds,

159
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:18,480
and wanted to unleash dogs on us.

160
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,070
Fortunately, I stopped...

161
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:19,950
Why are you saying those things?

162
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:27,760
Luo Shu.

163
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:31,230
Luo Shu.

164
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:34,150
What are you thinking?

165
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,440
I'm thinking that

166
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:39,590
you've

167
00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:41,080
come to Taiyuan
specially to ask for grain.

168
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:43,280
Why did Mr. Liu refuse you?

169
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:45,670
And at this very moment,

170
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:46,550
all the grain in the market

171
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:47,910
has been monopolized by Qin Yi.

172
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:49,790
Magistrate Han offended Miss Liu,

173
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:51,960
so Mr. Liu wanted to
avenge his daughter.

174
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,280
As for Qin Yi,

175
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:54,640
he is

176
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:55,880
greedy and mercenary.

177
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:56,910
He just wants to sell grain
at high prices

178
00:08:56,910 --> 00:08:58,200
and make a huge profit.

179
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:01,710
Qin Yi is hoarding grain
on a large scale

180
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:02,790
and raising prices.

181
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,790
Mr. Liu has relief grain,

182
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:05,960
but he's keeping it.

183
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,590
It cannot be a coincidence.

184
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,200
Young Master, slow down,
don't choke yourself.

185
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:22,670
Young Master.

186
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,590
Young Master, what are you doing?

187
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,640
Can't you see what I'm doing?

188
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:34,910
I can.

189
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:36,550
I'm just surprised.

190
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,590
How's Luo Shu?

191
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:41,640
Young Master,

192
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:42,790
if you have anything

193
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:43,550
on your mind,

194
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:44,520
just tell us.

195
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:46,150
Don't keep it to yourself.

196
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:48,080
What Miss Luo said today

197
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,670
was a bit harsh,

198
00:09:49,710 --> 00:09:50,910
but that's because you disappointed her
by harming yourself.

199
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:51,470
I'm asking you,

200
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:53,230
how's Luo Shu right now?

201
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:54,150
Miss Luo

202
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:55,710
is living with Magistrate Han now.

203
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:57,670
No...

204
00:09:57,910 --> 00:09:59,440
Lian Shu, clarify it.

205
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,080
I know, I'm sorry.

206
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:01,840
Young Master,

207
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,150
Luo Shu is staying

208
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:04,000
at the same inn

209
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,640
with Magistrate Han and Captain Cai.

210
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:13,030
Han Muzhi and Cai Dabing are also here?

211
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,080
Young Master,

212
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:16,320
is Magistrate Han

213
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,880
coming to pursue Luo Shu?

214
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:20,670
His coming to Taiyuan

215
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:22,000
has nothing to do with Luo Shu.

216
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:22,960
Is this the first day

217
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:23,840
you've known her?

218
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:24,960
Don't you know
what kind of person she is?

219
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,550
You've known her for so long.

220
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:27,910
She's always been decisive

221
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:29,150
and resolute.

222
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:32,350
Since she promised me,

223
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:34,320
she won't look back.

224
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:36,200
Definitely not.

225
00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:38,440
She promised to be with you,

226
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,960
and you two were so affectionate.

227
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:40,790
But today,

228
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:42,030
she still scolded you harshly.

229
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,320
That's because she cares about me,

230
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,350
doesn't want me to get hurt,

231
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:48,230
and motivates me
to pull myself together.

232
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:50,440
I feel like you asked for a scolding.

233
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,280
I need to cheer up

234
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,150
and get recovered.

235
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:55,790
I can't let Luo Shu

236
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:56,910
cry for me again.

237
00:10:58,760 --> 00:10:59,880
I've made up my mind.

238
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,200
Since Father doesn't

239
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,110
approve of me marrying Luo Shu,

240
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:04,790
I'll leave home

241
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,550
and live a secluded life with her.

242
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:09,960
No.

243
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:10,440
Young Master.

244
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,000
You still haven't considered
the consequences.

245
00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:12,710
But right now

246
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:13,910
I can't leave.

247
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:17,880
I must find out

248
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:20,400
why Luo Shu's parents

249
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,760
died.

250
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:23,400
I promised her

251
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:24,400
I'd give her an answer.

252
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:25,520
Young Master.

253
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:28,320
Don't think about leaving first.

254
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:29,670
Just think about

255
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:30,550
how to make Master

256
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:31,440
remove the guards

257
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,000
at the gate of Duoxi Garden,

258
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,550
so that you can leave Duoxi Garden

259
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:35,520
for now.

260
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,280
I don't need you to tell me that.

261
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,320
Grandmother came

262
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,470
this noon.

263
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:43,710
Young Master.

264
00:11:43,710 --> 00:11:44,550
Did you ask Her Ladyship

265
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:45,520
to plead for you?

266
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:46,960
Plead for me?

267
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:48,520
No. She went to scold

268
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:49,840
her own son.

269
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:51,670
There is always one thing
to overcome another.

270
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:53,760
Her Ladyship really loves you.

271
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:56,320
Young Master, take your time.

When will Mr. Liu be free to see me?

I don't know.

Your future son-in-law came.

Are you really going to

284
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:15,710
leave him waiting?

285
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:18,710
It's not that easy

286
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:20,030
to be my future son-in-law.

287
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:21,790
I still need to see

288
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:23,400
if he's qualified.

289

is truly profound.

292
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:34,280
He's waiting in the main hall.

293

He's here.

294
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,000
I'm gonna see him.

295
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:38,710
Miss Liu.

296
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:40,640
We should wait for a while.

297
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:42,320
Magistrate Han came to see Master

298
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,710
for something important.

299
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:05,440
Magistrate Han.

300
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,470
Is Mr. Liu about to see me?

301
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,350
Mr. Liu and Mr. Zhao

302
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:12,150
haven't finished their discussion.

303
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:13,400
He specially asked me

304
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,000
to inform you

305
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:17,520
that it's getting late today,

306
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:18,230
so he won't see you.

307
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:20,760
As for relief grain,

308
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:22,030
please don't worry.

he will consider the situation

311
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:28,960
and allocate grain to Linfen
sooner or later.

312
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:32,110

Please come with me.

00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,550
Magistrate Han offended Miss Liu,

319
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,470
so Mr. Liu wanted to
avenge his daughter.

320
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:00,590
Okay.

still for the relief grain?

00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:01,880
You already know, then why do you ask?

339
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:03,640
Did my father
make it hard for you again?

340
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,320
I was the one who broke promise first.

I'll be frank.

Ask him to show mercy

357
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:46,960
and allocate grain to Linfen.

00:16:50,590 --> 00:16:52,200
As for what I owe you,

359
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:54,710
I will definitely repay you.

360
00:16:55,590 --> 00:16:56,400
If you still

361
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:57,400
have any complaints about me,

come at me.

Don't get the people of Linfen involved.

364
00:17:09,710 --> 00:17:10,710
So, you think

365
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:12,590
my father won't send grain to Linfen

366
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:14,950
because you broke the engagement.

367
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:20,040
It's me using this to blackmail
and take revenge on you.

369
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,880
although I am just a woman,

I'm reasonable.

371
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:32,920
I would not,

372
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:34,640
and I disdain to do such things.

373
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:36,950
If you want to break the engagement,

374
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:40,430
you don't need to
humiliate me like this.

376
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:47,880
I will speak to my father

You've come.

380
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:11,470
Haven't you already
got the relief grain?

381
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,520
When do you plan to allocate to Linfen?

382
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,040
Did Han Muzhi come to see you?

383
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:20,070
Father, I know

384
00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:21,190
you won't make exceptions.

385
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:23,350
You don't want others to say
that you favor him.

386
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,160
But this famine in Linfen

387
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,230
is severe.

388
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,920
You can't neglect
the suffering of the people

389
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:29,350
just for your own reputation.

390
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:30,920
That's absurd.

391
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:32,920
That's a matter of politics,

392
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,350
not something you can meddle in.

393
00:18:35,470 --> 00:18:36,310
Father.

394
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,190
Alright,

395
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:40,880
I know

396
00:18:41,710 --> 00:18:43,070
you're worried that

397
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:44,640
this will affect your marriage,

398
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:45,350
right?

399
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:47,590
But let me tell you,

400
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:48,800
if Han Muzhi

401
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:50,920
blames you for this,

402
00:18:51,470 --> 00:18:52,920
then you're blind

403
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:53,950
and choose the wrong person.

404
00:18:54,430 --> 00:18:56,400
Such a person has no chance

405
00:18:56,950 --> 00:18:58,040
to enter our Liu family.

406
00:18:58,950 --> 00:19:00,680
But there are so many people in Linfen

407
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:01,950
who don't have food.

408
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,400
I know what I'm doing, okay?

409
00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:09,710
I know what I'm doing.

410
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:36,880
Each seed that's sown in spring.

411
00:19:39,310 --> 00:19:42,520
Will make autumn yields high.

412
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:48,800
What will fertile fields bring?

413
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:58,710
Of hunger peasants die.

414
00:20:00,710 --> 00:20:03,110
What will fertile fields bring?

415
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:06,920
Of hunger peasants die.

416
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:30,110
Your Honor, stop drinking.

417
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:32,470
Let me help you inside.

418
00:20:33,430 --> 00:20:35,640
Don't help me.

419
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:37,000
What's the use?

420
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:38,590
Your Honor,

421
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:41,830
does drinking really solve problems?

422
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:44,830
Mr. Liu won't allocate relief grain.

423
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:46,430
We'll think of

424
00:20:46,430 --> 00:20:47,920
other solutions.

425
00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:53,760
I, Han Muzhi,

426
00:20:55,230 --> 00:20:57,590
with ten years of diligent study,

427
00:20:59,070 --> 00:21:01,680
I once dreamed of riding
in the spring breeze

428
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:03,590
and seeing the prosperity
of the capital.

429
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:10,710
Until the emperor personally
picked me as Jinshi,

430
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:14,560
and Ministry of Personnel appointed me
as the magistrate of Linfen.

431
00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:22,230
I, Han Muzhi,

432
00:21:23,230 --> 00:21:25,040
do not seek big political achievements,

433
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:29,400
only want to ensure that
the people under my governance

434
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,190
have enough to eat and wear.

435
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,710
For this,

436
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:36,110
I had to give up

437
00:21:36,110 --> 00:21:38,590
the woman I love.

438
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,880
I'd rather let Luo Shu

439
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:48,950
and myself down

440
00:21:50,590 --> 00:21:53,310
than let the imperial court
and the people down.

441
00:21:53,310 --> 00:21:54,560
But now,

442
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:57,880
my people are starving,

443
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:59,310
and desperate.

444
00:21:59,310 --> 00:22:01,160
What am I contributing

445
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:02,470
as the magistrate?

446
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:04,830
To deal with the locust plague,

447
00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:08,190
I have to ask Pingyangwei for help.

448
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:12,280
To deal with the famine,
I have to borrow grain from the gentry.

449
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:14,830
Even to get removal papers,

450
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:16,000
I have to ask for help.

451
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:35,830
What's even ridiculous is,

452
00:22:36,470 --> 00:22:39,280
I pride myself on
being an upright person,

453
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,560
but today I suspected Miss Liu

454
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:43,350
with a mean heart.

455
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:45,830
How can I...

456
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:49,110
How can I face you all?

457
00:22:49,110 --> 00:22:50,430
How can I face my people?

458
00:22:51,110 --> 00:22:51,920
Your Honor.

459
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:53,350
Wait.

460
00:22:54,350 --> 00:22:55,160
Your Honor.

461
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:57,040
Why is he so drunk?

462
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:57,830
Leave me alone.

463
00:22:57,830 --> 00:22:58,950
I'm not drunk.

464
00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:01,430
I just don't have time.

465
00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:04,000
Captain Cai,

466
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:08,040
I don't have time.

467
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:10,350
The people of Linfen are waiting for me.

468
00:23:10,350 --> 00:23:11,230
Your Honor.

469
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:19,310
Each of those barn hamsters
is about the size of a dou.

470
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:20,310
Don't.

471
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,590
They are not man-shy
because they in government barns stay.

472
00:23:22,590 --> 00:23:23,310
Your Honor.

473
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:24,950
Your Honor, stop it.

474
00:23:24,950 --> 00:23:28,070
At the same time
all soldiers and civilians are hungry.

475
00:23:28,070 --> 00:23:29,590
Please stop it.

476
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:32,070
Who lets them eat government grain
at their will day by day?

477
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:32,830
Your Honor.

478
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:41,740
[Qin Mansion]

479
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:47,580
[Qin Mansion]

480
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:52,180
[Qin Mansion]

481
00:23:52,590 --> 00:23:53,400
Don't be afraid.

482
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:10,220
[Qin Mansion]

483
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:15,980
[Qin Mansion]

484
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:38,500
[Renowned for Noble Character
and Elegance]

485
00:25:07,310 --> 00:25:08,310
I thought

486
00:25:11,190 --> 00:25:12,920
I scared you last time

487
00:25:14,470 --> 00:25:16,560
and you didn't want to see me again.

488
00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:23,830
It seems I thought too much.

489
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:25,110
I'm still in your heart,

490
00:25:25,110 --> 00:25:26,400
right, Yulan?

491
00:25:34,310 --> 00:25:36,520
The severe famine in Linfen
caused great hardship among the people.

492
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:38,520
Mr. Qin,

493
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,190
please sell your surplus grain

494
00:25:40,430 --> 00:25:42,880
to help the people of Linfen
get through this difficult time.

495
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:45,110
So you're here to ask for grain.

496
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:48,760
Isn't this

497
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:50,310
the magistrate's duty?

498
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:51,400
What?

499
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:55,430
Did Han Muzhi send you to ask me?

500
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:57,760
This Han Muzhi

501
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,040
is quite interesting.

502
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:00,520
Last time,

503
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:02,280
he left angrily in front of me.

504
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:02,830
I thought

505
00:26:02,830 --> 00:26:04,560
he wouldn't agree to my conditions.

506
00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:06,070
Now it seems that

507
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,230
he is a coward who relies on women.

508
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,590
It wasn't Magistrate Han who sent me.

509
00:26:11,950 --> 00:26:13,160
I came voluntarily.

510
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:17,400
I know,

511
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:20,070
he helped you

512
00:26:20,070 --> 00:26:21,190
to leave Mingke House.

513
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:24,430
Are you just grateful to him,

514
00:26:25,230 --> 00:26:26,640
or do you have
residual feelings for him?

515
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:29,590
I've lived in Linfen for a long time

516
00:26:30,110 --> 00:26:31,680
and once worked at the yamen.

517
00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:33,400
I don't want to

518
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:34,760
see the people suffer.

519
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:43,950
Does Mr. Menglin know about

520
00:26:45,110 --> 00:26:46,350
your feelings towards Han Muzhi?

521
00:26:47,430 --> 00:26:48,710
Isn't he madly

522
00:26:48,710 --> 00:26:50,040
in love with you?

523
00:26:50,190 --> 00:26:51,000
How can he not care about

524
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,710
the man in your heart?

525
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:57,350
Oh, look at me.

526
00:26:57,350 --> 00:26:58,520
How could I forget

527
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,280
that Mr. Menglin and you

528
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:03,430
have a blood feud?

529
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,950
So it doesn't matter to you

530
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:08,920
about what he thinks now.

531
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:10,920
Mr. Qin,

532
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:13,040
please help the people of Linfen.

533
00:27:17,110 --> 00:27:18,640
You truly have a kind heart.

534
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:22,760
But I don't.

535
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:24,950
I am

536
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,110
just a

537
00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:28,920
greedy merchant.

538
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:31,350
I only care about two things.

539
00:27:33,070 --> 00:27:33,880
Money,

540
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:37,470
and you.

541
00:27:42,310 --> 00:27:44,190
Is it really about money?

542
00:27:45,110 --> 00:27:46,760
The disaster in Shanxi is so severe

543
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,590
that the imperial court
won't just stand by.

544
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:50,190
Once the disaster eases,

545
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,230
what are you gonna do

546
00:27:51,230 --> 00:27:52,430
with your surplus grain?

547
00:27:53,310 --> 00:27:54,430
You're a merchant.

548
00:27:54,830 --> 00:27:56,310
You won't do
the business of losing money.

549
00:27:56,830 --> 00:27:57,950
If you want to make money,

550
00:27:58,470 --> 00:27:59,830
now is the best chance

551
00:27:59,830 --> 00:28:01,000
to make a huge profit.

552
00:28:01,590 --> 00:28:02,400
Or,

553
00:28:03,110 --> 00:28:03,950
do you think

554
00:28:03,950 --> 00:28:05,920
that no matter how
the disaster develops,

555
00:28:06,190 --> 00:28:08,280
you will still benefit?

556
00:28:09,190 --> 00:28:10,430
Then what you want

557
00:28:10,950 --> 00:28:12,640
is not just money.

558
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:13,280
After all these years,

559
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:14,520
you still care about me.

560
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:15,710
Are you afraid I'll lose money?

561
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,880
I have no intention of snooping on you.

562
00:28:20,190 --> 00:28:23,350
I just want you to sell grain to Linfen.

563
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:36,160
Buying grain requires money.

564
00:28:37,230 --> 00:28:38,230
Do you have money?

565
00:28:39,470 --> 00:28:40,640
Does Han Muzhi

566
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,070
have money?

567
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:44,800
I do.

568
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:48,430
You do?

569
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:50,830
It seems that Wuniang

570
00:28:51,110 --> 00:28:52,230
had saved quite a bit of money

571
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:53,680
in the Qin family.

572
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:55,640
I wonder

573
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:57,280
how many things

574
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:58,950
she had obtained from the late Mr. Qin.

575
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:03,950
Alright then.

576
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:05,920
Are you willing to sell grain?

577
00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:08,400
I didn't say that.

578
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:14,310
I'm just telling you

579
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,590
whether to sell or not

580
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:19,560
is up to me.

581
00:29:20,470 --> 00:29:21,560
What do you want

582
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:22,680
exactly?

583
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:27,560
Do you remember?

584
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:30,590
I often knelt there when I was a kid.

585
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:32,830
It was like a routine.

586
00:29:34,590 --> 00:29:36,000
Things have changed now.

587
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:38,520
Now I'd like

588
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:39,950
to see people kneel in front of me.

589
00:29:41,430 --> 00:29:42,710
Why don't you try

590
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:44,880
kneeling in front of me and begging me?

591
00:29:45,830 --> 00:29:47,470
Maybe I'll consider your request.

592
00:30:05,310 --> 00:30:06,470
Mr. Qin,

593
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:08,950
I beg you to have mercy
on the people of Linfen.

594
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,560
Who are the people of Linfen?

595
00:30:13,190 --> 00:30:14,310
I don't know them.

596
00:30:16,190 --> 00:30:17,400
I only know you.

597
00:30:19,070 --> 00:30:22,640
Mr. Qin, I beg you to have mercy on me.

598
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:25,190
Who are you?

599
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:27,310
Luo Shu.

600
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:29,640
I don't know Luo Shu.

601
00:30:30,350 --> 00:30:31,590
Let me ask you again.

602
00:30:31,590 --> 00:30:32,830
Who are you?

603
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:36,070
Who are you?

604
00:30:37,470 --> 00:30:38,280
Yulan.

605
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:40,430
Speak louder, I can't hear you.

606
00:30:42,230 --> 00:30:43,040
Yulan.

607
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:54,710
If Han Muzhi

608
00:30:54,710 --> 00:30:56,400
and Qi Menglin

609
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:58,350
were to see you

610
00:30:58,350 --> 00:30:59,400
kneeling in front of me now,

611
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,800
what would they think?

612
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:05,880
But I don't care at all.

613
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:08,710
An incompetent magistrate,

614
00:31:08,710 --> 00:31:10,160
and a useless nobleman.

615
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:11,950
A perfect pair of losers.

616
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:14,280
What could they compete with me for?

617
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:15,640
What are they better than me at?

618
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:17,590
What do you see in them?

619
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,110
Mr. Qin, please help them

620
00:31:22,110 --> 00:31:23,190
to get through this difficult time.

621
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:26,110
I will never forget your kindness.

622
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:44,350
I can give you the grain,

623
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:47,710
but you have to promise me one thing.

624
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:56,760
Marry me.

625
00:32:00,190 --> 00:32:01,190
Marry me

626
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,880
and be the mistress of the Qin family.

627
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:06,830
From now on,

628
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,400
my money will be your money,

629
00:32:10,190 --> 00:32:11,920
my grain will be your grain,

630
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:14,800
and everything I have
will belong to you.

631
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:17,160
You can use it however you want.

632
00:32:18,830 --> 00:32:20,590
Even if this is a deal,

633
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:23,280
isn't it worth considering?

634
00:32:26,190 --> 00:32:27,000
Wait.

635
00:32:42,070 --> 00:32:43,520
If you leave like this,

636
00:32:45,190 --> 00:32:46,520
you may regret.

637
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:49,800
How about this,

638
00:32:50,470 --> 00:32:51,710
I'll give you three days

639
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,520
to think it over.

640
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:55,400
If I don't receive your reply

641
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:56,710
within three days,

642
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:59,830
Han Muzhi won't get

643
00:32:59,830 --> 00:33:01,590
a single grain from me.

644
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:25,230
Young Master.

645
00:33:25,230 --> 00:33:26,560
After eating,

646
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:28,400
you've recovered a lot.

647
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:30,590
I have to

648
00:33:30,590 --> 00:33:31,400
take care of myself.

649
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:33,110
Luo Shu can't live without me.

650
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:35,310
It's you who can't live without Luo Shu.

651
00:33:36,110 --> 00:33:37,160
Isn't it the same thing?

652
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:39,190
Yes.

653
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:41,590
Yanjin.

654
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:42,830
What are you doing here?

655
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:45,430
I've come

656
00:33:45,430 --> 00:33:46,950
to see how you're recovering.

657
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:50,430
Look, I'm much better now.

658
00:33:51,430 --> 00:33:52,310
Weren't you

659
00:33:52,310 --> 00:33:53,710
on a hunger strike a few days ago?

660
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:54,920
Have you come around now?

661
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:56,920
Yes.

662
00:33:57,430 --> 00:33:58,400
Luo Shu is right.

663
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:00,310
Hurting myself won't solve any problems.

664
00:34:00,310 --> 00:34:01,560
As long as I take action,

665
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:02,760
there's always a way out.

666
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,160
At least I need to be in good health.

667
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:05,110
Luo Shu.

668
00:34:05,110 --> 00:34:06,280
All you think about is Luo Shu.

669
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:07,430
You still won't give up?

670
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:08,760
I heard that

671
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:11,040
she came last time
to scold you severely.

672
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:13,000
It seems that
she wants to cut ties with you.

673
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,520
I didn't take it seriously.

674
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:16,470
She said that to make me
pull myself together.

675
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:17,670
What she said

676
00:34:17,670 --> 00:34:19,040
was to make you pull yourself together.

677
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:19,430
What I said...

678
00:34:19,430 --> 00:34:20,280
Yanjin,

679
00:34:21,230 --> 00:34:22,800
do you come here to scold me?

680
00:34:23,630 --> 00:34:24,950
I'm busy, okay?

681
00:34:25,670 --> 00:34:27,760
Father asked you to see him.

682
00:34:28,710 --> 00:34:30,150
I'm going.

683
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:56,430
I am unfilial.

684
00:34:57,390 --> 00:34:58,280
I'm sorry.

685
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:00,000
Since I was young,

686
00:35:00,190 --> 00:35:01,950
you've always given me
whatever I've asked for.

687
00:35:02,670 --> 00:35:03,520
But

688
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:06,280
I haven't shared your burdens

689
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:08,910
or contributed to our Qi family.

690
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,000
Fengzhou has just passed away.

691
00:35:11,630 --> 00:35:13,190
Not only did I fail to understand you,

692
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:14,430
but I also argued with you.

693
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:17,430
These days,

694
00:35:17,430 --> 00:35:18,520
I've been reflecting on myself.

695
00:35:19,390 --> 00:35:22,150
I was so unreasonable.

696
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:23,360
I'm sorry.

697
00:35:32,430 --> 00:35:34,520
Get up.

698
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:36,040
That's enough for me.

699
00:35:38,230 --> 00:35:39,190
Sit there.

700
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:41,120
Come here.

701
00:35:41,630 --> 00:35:42,840
That day,

702
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:45,950
I hit you a bit too hard.

703
00:35:46,190 --> 00:35:46,800
No.

704
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:47,560
Do you hurt?

705
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:49,670
If I hadn't

706
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:51,840
argued with you that day,

707
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:53,950
you wouldn't have punished me.

708
00:35:59,950 --> 00:36:00,840
You,

709
00:36:01,670 --> 00:36:04,080
you've really been spoiled

710
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:05,320
by me.

711
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,230
I always thought that

712
00:36:07,230 --> 00:36:08,950
since you have two older brothers,

713
00:36:09,150 --> 00:36:10,320
I wouldn't force you

714
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:11,560
to do anything.

715
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:13,630
As long as you didn't do anything wrong,

716
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:15,120
you could do whatever you wanted.

717
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:16,390
As long as you were content

718
00:36:16,470 --> 00:36:18,390
and happy.

719
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:21,000
But things are different now.

720
00:36:21,390 --> 00:36:23,040
Fengzhou has passed away.

721
00:36:24,190 --> 00:36:25,910
And I don't know when

722
00:36:25,910 --> 00:36:26,430
I...

723
00:36:26,430 --> 00:36:27,080
Father,

724
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:28,470
don't say that.

725
00:36:29,390 --> 00:36:32,120
I'll listen to you from now on.

726
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:36,120
Will you really listen to me?

727
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:39,470
I'll work hard.

728
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,280
Alright.

729
00:36:42,910 --> 00:36:44,150
Good.

730
00:36:44,470 --> 00:36:46,560
I'll remove the guards

731
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:48,670
at the gate of your garden.

732
00:36:49,190 --> 00:36:49,760
And then,

733
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:51,080
you go to visit your grandmother.

734
00:36:51,430 --> 00:36:52,320
Also,

735
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:53,800
say something nice for me

736
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:55,280
in front of her.

737
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:57,840
Your grandmother has been

738
00:36:58,470 --> 00:37:00,080
coming to scold me these days.

739
00:37:01,150 --> 00:37:02,080
Don't worry, Father.

740
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:04,080
I'm the best at

741
00:37:04,190 --> 00:37:05,230
making grandmother happy.

742
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:07,300
[A Home From Home]

743
00:37:16,910 --> 00:37:17,710
[Longtai Inn]
Captain Cai.

744
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:19,870
Who are you?

745
00:37:20,670 --> 00:37:22,080
I'm a subordinate of Mr. Qin.

746
00:37:22,190 --> 00:37:23,430
Last time, you and Magistrate Han

747
00:37:23,430 --> 00:37:25,230
came to our mansion to ask for grain.

748
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:28,040
I remember now.

749
00:37:28,470 --> 00:37:29,280
What?

750
00:37:29,710 --> 00:37:30,280
Is he willing to

751
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:31,390
sell us grain now?

752
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:32,360
No.

753
00:37:32,630 --> 00:37:33,670
Mr. Qin

754
00:37:33,670 --> 00:37:35,470
sent me to ask Miss Luo

755
00:37:35,470 --> 00:37:36,120
whether she needs

756
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:37,430
any jewelry or clothing.

757
00:37:37,430 --> 00:37:38,430
Just let us know.

758
00:37:38,430 --> 00:37:40,560
After all, it's our Qin family
who is marrying her,

00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:41,800
she can't look too shabby.

760
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:42,670
What?

761
00:37:43,870 --> 00:37:45,630
Marrying who?

762
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:47,000
Wait,

763
00:37:47,150 --> 00:37:48,360
what do you mean?

764
00:37:48,670 --> 00:37:49,760
I'm saying that

765
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:50,910
Mr. Qin

766
00:37:50,910 --> 00:37:52,430
is going to marry Miss Luo.

767
00:37:52,470 --> 00:37:54,080
I'm gonna ask her
if she needs anything else,

768
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:55,800
but since I happened to meet you,

769
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:57,840
please deliver the message,

770
00:37:58,120 --> 00:37:58,630
thank you.

[Longtai Inn]

772
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:05,950
Luo Shu,

773
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:07,630
don't you know

774
00:38:07,870 --> 00:38:08,910
what kind of person he is?

775
00:38:09,150 --> 00:38:09,840
How could you

776
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:11,840
marry him?

777
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:17,430
If that man hadn't come to ask you,

778
00:38:17,630 --> 00:38:18,190
wouldn't you

779
00:38:18,190 --> 00:38:19,710
even plan to tell us?

[Longtai Inn]

781
00:38:27,950 --> 00:38:29,560
Even if there is no other way now,

782
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:30,800
I would never agree

783
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:32,280
to let you trade yourself for grain.

784
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:34,670
If I can

785
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:36,910
trade myself for
tens of thousands of dans of grain,

786
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:38,840
I'm willing to do it.

787
00:38:39,950 --> 00:38:40,840
Qin Yi is a scoundrel.

788
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:42,040
Even if you marry him,

789
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:43,600
he may not give us the grain.

790
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:44,710
Captain Cai is right.

791
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:46,910
You know Qin Yi.

792
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,710
He is slick and not trustworthy,

793
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:49,910
and he's vicious.

794
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:51,120
How can you believe

795
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:52,280
someone like that?

796
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:53,630
But that's the only way.

797
00:38:53,630 --> 00:38:55,040
That's the only solution.

798
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:57,800
For the sake of the people of Linfen,

799
00:38:58,320 --> 00:38:59,230
I'm willing to try.

800
00:38:59,230 --> 00:39:00,190
What you just said

801
00:39:00,190 --> 00:39:01,950
is my responsibility as an official.

802

You are a woman,

00:39:03,950 --> 00:39:04,430
this is not

something you should bear.

805
00:39:06,390 --> 00:39:07,190
Besides,

00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:09,280
I'm the magistrate of Linfen.

Your Honor, don't blame yourself.

808
00:39:14,190 --> 00:39:15,360
This has nothing to do with you.

809

How can the affairs of the people

If you marry Qin Yi,

814
00:39:26,870 --> 00:39:28,040
what is he gonna do?

please keep it a secret for me.

Don't worry.

Why can't you

832
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:30,710
Shut up.

military and political affairs

835
00:40:34,630 --> 00:40:36,360
are not for you to gossip about.

836
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:37,760
What exactly have you learned

this year?

838
00:40:39,710 --> 00:40:41,560
Have you learned the way
of being an official

839
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:42,670
and a decent human?

840
00:40:42,670 --> 00:40:43,360

you haven't

made any progress at all.

843
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:47,520
All I know is that

00:40:47,870 --> 00:40:48,560
the grain

845
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:49,800
is produced by the people.

00:40:50,190 --> 00:40:51,470
Now that they are in trouble,

847
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:52,520
why can't we lend grain

848
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:53,630
to help them survive the famine?

849
00:40:53,630 --> 00:40:54,840
Why not?

00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:58,150
What is

851
00:40:58,150 --> 00:40:58,840
exactly going on

852
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:00,710
in your head?

853
00:41:02,190 --> 00:41:04,190
You are just

854
00:41:04,190 --> 00:41:05,190
so stupid.

856
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:08,390
is Han Muzhi, right?

857

Who is he?

858
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:13,000
He is Liu Yiqing's future son-in-law.

859

The relief grain

860
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:15,760
is in Liu Yiqing's hands now.

861

The relief grain

862
00:41:16,710 --> 00:41:18,630
is the vital sustenance

863
00:41:18,630 --> 00:41:19,910
that keeps people alive.

864
00:41:19,950 --> 00:41:21,230
Now, one side refuses to allocate,

865
00:41:21,230 --> 00:41:22,320
while the other side begs for it.

866
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:24,230
I want to see how this father-son pair

867
00:41:24,230 --> 00:41:25,840
will end up.

868
00:41:25,950 --> 00:41:27,320
Do you understand?

869
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:28,950
Facing the suffering of the people,

870
00:41:29,390 --> 00:41:30,950
you just choose to stand by?

871
00:41:31,230 --> 00:41:32,120
This is a crucial moment.

872
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:32,710
As the Governor,

873
00:41:32,710 --> 00:41:33,470
you have the authority
to use military grain

874
00:41:33,470 --> 00:41:34,280
to stabilize the home front.

875
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:35,670
That's silly.

876
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:38,000
Go back to your room.

877
00:41:38,910 --> 00:41:39,710
Go back.

878
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:47,430

Please eat some.

882

If you don't eat,

883
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:04,870
you won't have the energy
to pursue Miss Luo.

884
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:05,670
Get out.

885
