[Episode 21]

4
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:36,630
How dare you!

5
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:37,630
How dare you tie me up!

6
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:42,040
Who is he?

7
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:44,270
He is...

8
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,270
This is the son of Governor Qi,

9
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:50,120
Mr. Qi,
the Deputy Commandant of Pingyangwei.

10
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:53,270
He's here looking for Miss Luo.

11
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:55,360
They are both my friends.

12
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:57,120
The servants just misunderstood.

13
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:59,400
Right, we're all friends.

14
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:01,720
Who are you?

15
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:07,800
I am Zhou Xian,
the county school instructor of Linfen.

16
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:09,670
I didn't recognize you.

17
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,320
Please forgive me.

18
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:12,520
Forgive me.

19
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:16,160
You damn fools...

20
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,830
How could you capture Mr. Qi?

21
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,910
Mr. Zhou, it's a misunderstanding!

22
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:20,470
We saw

23
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:21,440
Mr. Qi riding on the wall,

24
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,240
so we grabbed him.

25
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:22,880
I...

26
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:24,440
Mr. Qi was anxious to find me.

27
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:25,800
That's why this happened.

28
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:26,880
I knocked on your door.

29
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:28,030
Why didn't you open it?

30
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,110
Exactly!

31
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:31,800
You servants

32
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,030
can't even recognize Mr. Qi.

33
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:34,320
Hurry up and get out of here.

34
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,270
Yes!

35
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:40,360
It's a misunderstanding.

36
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:43,470
Commandant Qi, you're very magnanimous.

37
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:45,750
Don't take it to heart.

38
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,880
But that thing

39
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:53,270
was really found

40
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:55,000
in Mrs. Zhou's room.

41
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,470
It doesn't belong to Commandant Qi...

42
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:57,030
Xian,

43
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:57,800
I truly didn't do

44
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,910
to wrong you.

45
00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:00,110
You have to believe me. I...

46
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:01,270
Enough with the noise!

47
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,600
Mr. Qi.

48
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:09,390
Sorry for my family drama.

49
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:11,030
It's rare for you to visit.

50
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:12,110
Let me

51
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:13,320
prepare a feast for you

52
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:14,670
to show my apologies.

53
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:15,880
Xian,

54
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,720
I need to talk with Miss Luo

55
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:18,830
and Mr. Qi.

56
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:22,320
Okay! Go ahead and chat.

57
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:24,080
Mr. Qi.

58
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:28,000
If you need anything, just let me know.

59
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:34,750
Take care of your household matters.

60
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:36,270
Yes!

61
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,600
There are outsiders here.

62
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:56,080
I can't ask too much.

63
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:01,550
But about today's incident,

64
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:05,080
you must give me an explanation.

65
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:08,470
I didn't do it.

66
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,470
How can I explain that to you?

67
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,160
Well, this...

68
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,160
Xian.

69
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:14,440
Calm down!

70
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,720
Our son will wake up from his nap soon.

71
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,670
He'll definitely be clamoring for you.

72
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,160
Let's head back for now.

73
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,830
I was wrong earlier.

74
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:13,950
I apologize again, Miss Luo.

75
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,880
Miss Liu,
you don't need to be so formal.

76
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:22,110
Today, my relatives

77
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:23,830
offended Mr. Qi.

78
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:25,830
I apologize on their behalf.

79
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:31,200
Today, for Luo Shu's sake,

80
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,440
I won't hold it against you.

81
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:34,320
But if you bully Luo Shu again,

82
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:35,720
I won't be

83
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:36,760
so easy to deal with next time.

84
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:40,670
Let's go.

85
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:41,200
Wait!

86
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:43,640
I've heard

87
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:45,390
that you're skilled in investigations.

88
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,790
Can I ask for your advice?

89
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,230
Okay!

90
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,440
Can I invite you

91
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,720
to stay here for a few days?

92
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,270
It'll be easier for me
to consult with you.

93
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,510
Miss Liu.

94
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,070
You use Luo Shu when needed,

95
00:05:57,070 --> 00:05:58,230
but ignore her when not.

96
00:05:58,920 --> 00:05:59,950
For investigating,

97
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:01,790
shouldn't you be asking Han Muzhi?

98
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:07,600
It's obvious

99
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:09,600
that Wenyin is being framed.

100
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,720
But I don't know how to help her.

101
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,950
She's a refined lady

102
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,320
with a reserved temperament.

103
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:17,790
If this isn't cleared up,

104
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:19,230
her future will...

105
00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:20,760
Honestly, I can see it.

106
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:22,640
She doesn't seem like the type

107
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,040
to do something like that.

108
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:25,830
You're really good at investigations.

109
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,160
Please help me.

110
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:31,270
It depends on who.

111
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,070
You're so capable.

112
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:34,320
You can handle it yourself.

113
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:38,000
I will help you
get to the bottom of this case.

114
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:39,510
It's my responsibility.

115
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:40,640
What are you doing?

116
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,670
This isn't your concern.

117
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:44,350
It shouldn't be my problem.

118
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,320
But you jumped over the wall to find me,

119
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,320
and caused such a big misunderstanding.

120
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:49,510
So now it involves me.

121
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:50,320
I...

122
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:54,350
Fine.

123
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,160
Since you stay,

124
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,600
I won't leave either.

125
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,790
Are you worried your reputation

126
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:06,000
isn't ruined enough?

127
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,000
What if

128
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:08,790
you're alone here

129
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:11,070
and someone

130
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:11,790
bullies you again?

131
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:15,070
Don't worry, Mr. Qi.

132
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:17,880
I need Miss Luo's help.

133
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:20,200
I make sure she will be treated well.

134
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,110
Can you do me a favor?

135
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:24,950
What do you need?

136
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:26,390
Help me take a leave from the yamen.

137
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:27,920
Just say I'm at a friend's place

138
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:28,920
for a few days.

139
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,110
I won't be back for now.

140
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,720
You also want me to help you take leave?

141
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:32,830
Well, I owe you

142
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:33,880
a lot of favors.

143
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:34,950
This counts as one.

144
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,440
The more you owe me, the better.

145
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:39,920
Besides,

146
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,320
staying away from Han Muzhi
for a few days

147
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:41,950
is good.

148
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:43,720
What do you say?

149
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:46,480
Then...

150
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,040
Since that's the case,

151
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,040
I'll

152
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,070
help you out.

153
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:52,440
And...

154
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,320
Don't mention Miss Liu,

155
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,670
especially not to Magistrate Han.

156
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:00,920
I warn you,

157
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,000
you must treat Luo Shu well.

158
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,880
If she gets hurt again,

159
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:06,510
I won't let you off easily.

160
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:13,070
Yue is so aggressive.

161
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:15,110
I have no evidence,

162
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:17,000
so I can only let her slander me.

163
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:18,720
I can never

164
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,950
clear my name.

165
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:22,070
Though Yue is a concubine,

166
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:24,230
she acts without restraint.

167
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:26,200
What's the reason for this?

168
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:31,600
It's my fault.

169
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,760
After marrying into the Zhou family
for so many years,

170
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,910
I haven't had a child.

171
00:08:38,590 --> 00:08:39,760
But Yue

172
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,280
bore the only son

173
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,550
for the Zhou family.

174
00:08:43,550 --> 00:08:45,000
Of course, she's bold.

175
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,550
But you're his wife.

176
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:51,760
She grew up with Xian.

177
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:54,150
I'm the outsider here.

178
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:56,200
How could I compete

179
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:58,080
with their childhood bond?

180
00:08:58,910 --> 00:09:00,280
Did you know about this earlier?

181
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,470
After two years of marriage
into the Zhou family,

182
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:07,320
I still have no children.

183
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,230
So Zhou Xian suggested
taking a concubine.

184
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,350
Though I was unwilling,

185
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:15,960
for the sake of the Zhou family,

186
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:18,350
for Xian,

187
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,840
I had to compromise.

188
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:23,030
After Xian took her in,

189
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:25,790
I found out

190
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:30,760
she and Xian had been betrothed before.

191
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:32,520
After breaking off the engagement,

192
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,280
Xian came to my family to propose.

193
00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:38,350
Once she moved in,

194
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,000
Xian showered her with affection,

195
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,790
while he was cold to me.

196
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,230
Last year, my father passed away,

197
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,030
and she had a son.

198
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,670
So my life in the Zhou family...

199
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:56,550
I know he married me

200
00:09:57,710 --> 00:09:59,640
because my father was an official,

201
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,910
which is beneficial for his career.

202
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:05,150
But now, things have changed.

203
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,910
All I can do

204
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:09,590
is live

205
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:11,440
by his moods.

206
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:12,960
If you keep putting up with her,

207
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:14,670
you'll just encourage her

208
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:16,910
to think you're weak
and easy to bully.

209
00:10:26,590 --> 00:10:27,670
I used to think

210
00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:29,640
I could just put up with it,

211
00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:31,640
keep my distance,

212
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:32,710
and let it go.

213
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:34,550
But now,

214
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:37,710
she's actually trying to

215
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:39,280
do anything to get the wife position.

216
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:42,440
She even wants Zhou Xian to divorce me.

217
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:45,710
If I keep putting up with this,

218
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:48,440
I might end up not only being thrown out

219
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:52,440
but also living in shame.

220
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:55,760
Miss Luo,

221
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,470
Wenyin has already
suffered too much.

222
00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:01,760
So I'm counting on you for this.

223
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:08,230
To prove your innocence,

224
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:11,470
we first need to find out
who the man is.

225
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,000
At that time, Madam was taking a nap,

226
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:21,280
and I came back from outside

227
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:23,200
with some embroidery patterns.

228
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,670
Did you see what the person looked like?

229
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:30,910
I was too far away

230
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:32,470
to see his face clearly.

231
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:35,320
But I felt he was tall

232
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:36,910
and very agile.

233
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,640
This person could sneak into your room

234
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:41,590
to leave the underwear,

235
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,280
so he must have planned it beforehand.

236
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:46,000
He even chose the time
when you were napping.

237
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,670
It shows he knows

238
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:48,790
the inner courtyard well.

239
00:11:53,150 --> 00:11:54,470
Who usually has access

240
00:11:54,470 --> 00:11:55,640
to the inner courtyard?

241
00:11:56,030 --> 00:11:57,350
We've sent people to look around,

242
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:58,880
but we can't find Luo Shu anywhere.

243
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:01,200
Where could Luo Shu have gone?

244
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:03,280
Send out more people to look for her.

245
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:04,710
Don't come back until you find her.

246
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:05,840
Yes.

247
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:06,470
Stop looking for her.

248
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:08,960
Mr. Qi.

249
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:09,640
Magistrate Han.

250
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,550
I'm here to take leave for Luo Shu.

251
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:13,400
Where is she?

252
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,200
She's at a friend's place.

253
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,320
She said she'll be away for a few days.

254
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,230
What friend?

255
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:18,110
Maybe someone she knew before.

256
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:18,960
I'm not sure.

257
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:21,470
Anyway, I brought the message.

258
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:24,320
I have other things to do,
so I'll go now.

259
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:28,590
What were you doing

260
00:12:28,590 --> 00:12:29,440
at noon?

261
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,280
I was planting flowers.

262
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:31,550
After planting,

263
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:32,910
I went to eat.

264
00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:33,640
We had lunch at home

265
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:35,110
and then

266
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:36,350
came to work.

267
00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:36,790
Same here.

268
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:38,110
I was with my master.

269
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:39,710
I was fixing the roof
of the west courtyard.

270
00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:40,790
The roof was leaking,

271
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:42,280
so I added a few tiles.

272
00:12:42,590 --> 00:12:43,590
This isn't that person either.

273
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:55,080
How about it?

274
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,640
Have you found anything?

275
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,320
If this man

276
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,960
was indeed sent by Yue,

277
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:08,550
even if he hasn't entered
the inner courtyard,

278
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,400
Yue would tell him

279
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:11,590
about the situation inside.

280
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,590
But that makes it too broad.

281
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:15,080
There's no way to trace it.

282
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:17,840
Do you know

283
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,590
any men who are close with Yue?

284
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,320
I heard from the cook

285
00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:26,320
that Yue

286
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,670
arranged for a distant cousin

287
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:29,230
to be a groom in the house.

288
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:30,910
What's this person like?

289
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:32,670
Tall and strong.

290
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:40,150
This is the stable.

291
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:43,200
Where did everyone go?

292
00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:44,150
I'm coming.

293
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,000
I'm here.

294
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:49,400
Miss,

295
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:51,080
is Mrs. Zhou needing the carriage?

296
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:53,150
These two young ladies are here
on Mrs. Zhou's orders

297
00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:54,200
to ask you some questions.

298
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,440
Is there a tall,

299
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:58,000
strong groom here?

300
00:13:58,150 --> 00:13:59,910
Yes, Niu Dali.

301
00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:01,110
Where is he?

302
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:01,670
He...

303
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:03,550
He's out drinking.

304
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,080
Wait a moment, please.

305
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:06,520
We're about to switch shifts,

306
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:07,550
and he will be back soon.

307
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,030
Look, he's back.

308
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:11,200
Dali!

309
00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:15,230
You went drinking again?

310
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:15,960
What's going on?

311
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,670
These young ladies
have some questions for you.

312
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:18,520
Quick!

313
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:19,470
Go away!

314
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:31,320
Where were you at noon?

315
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:35,230
I was out drinking.

316
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:36,520
Is there a problem?

317
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,230
There was a burglar.

318
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:45,280
We are here to investigate.

319
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:47,280
Why me?

320
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:48,280
I wasn't even there.

321
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,760
Bao, it's time to eat!

322
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:10,440
Come on, you eat too.

323
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,110
Thanks, Xian.

324
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:13,520
It's hot!

325
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:15,670
By the way,

326
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:16,910
a few days ago,

327
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:19,470
I asked you to check your family's shops

328
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:21,590
for a good Duan inkstone.

329
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:22,640
Have you found one?

330
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:24,470
Don't worry, Xian.

331
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:25,110
I've already

332
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:26,640
told my dad to keep an eye out.

333
00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:28,470
This is about your future,

334
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:29,790
so I asked him to make sure it's done.

335
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:31,350
My dad

336
00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:33,110
will definitely bring one back

337
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,350
on his trip to buy supplies.

338
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:37,710
Good.

339
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:40,000
Magistrate Han

340
00:15:40,110 --> 00:15:41,640
is a successful Jinshi appointed

341
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:42,790
by His Majesty.

342
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,590
Last time, he taught at the school.

343
00:15:44,590 --> 00:15:46,760
He was so impressive.

344
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:48,230
He'll surely appreciate this gift.

345
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:50,880
Luckily, we already

346
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,110
have a connection.

347
00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:53,230
If we give him

348
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:54,790
a nice inkstone,

349
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,000
our friendship

350
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,320
will deepen.

351
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:58,790
That would be great!

352
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:01,550
Actually, Wan is Magistrate Han...

353
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:02,320
Bao,

354
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:04,030
why haven't you eaten yet?

355
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,350
It's really hot.

356
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:06,200
It's hot, right?

357
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:07,280
How about

358
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:09,000
letting your dad blow on it for you?

359
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:09,670
Okay.

360
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,470
Come on,

361
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:13,960
let me feed you.

362
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:16,080
I'm coming.

363
00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:18,840
You've become so heavy now.

364
00:16:21,710 --> 00:16:22,350
Give it to me.

365
00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:24,440
Here.

366
00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:26,280
Blow on it.

367
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:27,880
Why didn't I see Zi Yan

368
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:29,280
serving you today?

369
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:31,320
I had her do a few things.

370
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:33,400
I heard that

371
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:35,790
Miss Liu's friend hasn't left yet.

372
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:38,400
She's asking around the house.

373
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:43,760
You let an outsider

374
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,350
dig into our family matters?

375
00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:49,110
You want an explanation,

376
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:50,960
so I need to investigate first.

377
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:52,960
Wan and Miss Luo

378
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,230
both stayed willingly.

379
00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:56,320
I want to hear your explanation.

380
00:16:58,960 --> 00:16:59,910
Are you suggesting

381
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:01,320
I should just admit it?

382
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:03,910
But how can I admit to something

383
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:05,590
I didn't do?

384
00:17:08,590 --> 00:17:09,400
Fine.

385
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:12,040
Let me be clear here.

386
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:13,950
Right now is a critical time

387
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:15,110
for my promotion.

388
00:17:16,070 --> 00:17:17,560
If you stir up trouble

389
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:19,070
and cause a scene,

390
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:21,280
I won't let you off the hook.

391
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:26,590
Come on, son.

392
00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:28,230
Keep eating.

393
00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:29,110
Open wide.

394
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:30,680
You blow on it for me.

395
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:42,520
How's it going?

396
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:43,680
Madam, I found it.

397
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:44,070
I found

398
00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:45,400
the tavern that Dali often visits,

399
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,520
and the shopkeeper knows him.

400
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:48,680
He said Dali often

401
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:49,760
drinks there at noon.

402
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:50,680
But today,

403
00:17:51,190 --> 00:17:52,800
he arrived later than usual.

404
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:56,110
It must be him!

405
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:00,190
What does he drink at the tavern?

406
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:01,230
The shopkeeper said

407
00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:02,760
he only drinks the finest liquor,

408
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:03,760
spending quite generously.

409
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:05,110
How can a servant

410
00:18:05,430 --> 00:18:06,880
buy such good liquor?

411
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:07,920
He must have received

412
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,160
some favors from Yue.

413
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:11,070
It's definitely suspicious.

414
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:12,710
But this is all just speculation.

415
00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:14,400
To have solid proof,

416
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:15,520
we need Dali

417
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,430
to confess.

418
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,280
He's related to Yue.

419
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:19,680
There's no way he'll admit it.

420
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:21,160
Madam, don't worry.

421
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:23,110
As long as he did it,

422
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:24,880
we'll find a way to make him talk.

423
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:29,070
Wenyin, how about

424
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:30,640
we go straight to the authorities?

425
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:31,710
Absolutely not!

426
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:33,680
If they find out,

427
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:35,400
it will definitely
affect Xian's promotion.

428
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:36,920
I'm afraid that by then,

429
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,920
even if I haven't done it,

430
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:41,070
he will still divorce me.

431
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:09,880
Lian Shu, prepare the carriage.

432
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,400
Young Master, we've arrived.

433
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:41,160
Young Master!

434
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,190
Shall we just wait here?

435
00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:45,070
Yes, we'll just wait.

436
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,110
Only this way can I feel at ease.

437
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:50,800
If anyone bullies Luo Shu,

438
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:52,310
we'll rush in to help her.

439
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:56,280
Got it.

440
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:06,000
Miss Luo!

441
00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:08,520
Miss Luo!

442
00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:15,280
Something happened!

443
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,470
He died suddenly!

444
00:20:16,470 --> 00:20:17,110
Is that right?

445
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:18,710
He seemed fine yesterday.

446
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:19,710
Didn't he bully you

447
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:20,430
a few days ago?

448
00:20:20,430 --> 00:20:21,160
Xian,

449
00:20:21,230 --> 00:20:22,560
what happened here?

450
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:23,470
How did this happen?

451
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,430
How can he die suddenly?

452
00:20:29,430 --> 00:20:31,350
He didn't seem like someone
who would take his own life.

453
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:32,400
How can he die suddenly?

454
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:32,950
Is that right?

455
00:20:32,950 --> 00:20:34,190
He was fine yesterday.

456
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:35,560
Didn't he

457
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:36,400
bully you yesterday?

458
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:36,920
Yeah.

459
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:38,470
He didn't seem like someone
who would take his own life.

460
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:43,590
Could the underwear on Mrs Zhou's bed

461
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:45,470
belong to him?

462
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:46,760
What are you talking about?

463
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:47,680
Don't believe her.

464
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,560
No wonder I heard someone say

465
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,520
they saw him sneaking around

466
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,920
near the inner courtyard.

467
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,160
What nonsense are you saying?

468
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:54,640
No!

469
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,040
Then tell me,

470
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,520
how could a healthy person

471
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,710
choose to take his own life?

472
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:00,560
Could it be

473
00:21:01,350 --> 00:21:02,710
that someone forced him to?

474
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:04,760
How can you slander me like this?

475
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,520
Madam, I didn't say

476
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:08,040
you forced him to die!

477
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:09,040
Are you

478
00:21:09,710 --> 00:21:11,000
feeling guilty?

479
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:12,830
Xian!

480
00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:14,920
She's making a scene
and smearing my reputation!

481
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:15,950
I'm not!

482
00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:17,280
Alright, stop arguing.

483
00:21:19,590 --> 00:21:20,470
Xian,

484
00:21:20,830 --> 00:21:22,040
as your wife,

485
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:24,040
she failed to bear any children
for the Zhou family.

486
00:21:24,430 --> 00:21:26,190
You've tolerated
so much for your future,

487
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:27,560
but now she's done

488
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:28,710
something like this!

489
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:29,640
Xian,

490
00:21:30,110 --> 00:21:31,760
you can't tolerate this any longer!

491
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:32,560
Enough!

492
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:34,400
Whose wife or concubine

493
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,470
would act like you two,

494
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:36,950
quarreling every day?

495
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:37,880
Must you create trouble

496
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:38,950
at a time like this?

497
00:21:45,310 --> 00:21:46,190
What happened today

498
00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:48,830
stays among us.

499
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,190
Anyone who leaks it
will face severe consequences.

500
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:53,310
Yes.

501
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,350
Is it nice to have a body
hanging around?

502
00:21:56,350 --> 00:21:57,430
Get it down right now!

503
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:58,920
Quick!

504
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:02,640
Hurry, call his family over

505
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:03,470
and take him away.

506
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:05,760
Say he hanged himself.

507
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:10,760
Why are you just standing there?

508
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:12,160
Wasn't he your family?

509
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:13,800
Yes.

510
00:22:14,230 --> 00:22:15,920
I'll send someone
to inform them right away.

511
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:27,800
What's going on?

512
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:30,070
I saw Luo Shu trying to sneak away.

513
00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:30,640
She must think

514
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,000
she's unable to solve the case,

515
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:32,800
feeling guilty.

516
00:22:41,950 --> 00:22:42,800
Miss Liu,

517
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,110
I saw you two

518
00:22:44,110 --> 00:22:45,230
talking inside,

519
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:46,470
so I didn't want to interrupt.

520
00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:47,110
I'm heading back to the yamen...

521
00:22:47,110 --> 00:22:47,800
Looks like

522
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,520
you think that with Niu Dali dead,

523
00:22:50,830 --> 00:22:52,280
there's no hope left.

524
00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:54,880
Forget it.

525
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:58,040
If you want to leave, go ahead.

526
00:22:58,280 --> 00:22:59,230
You misunderstood.

527
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:01,710
I think his death

528
00:23:01,710 --> 00:23:02,680
is suspicious.

529
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,070
I don't think he killed himself.

530
00:23:09,310 --> 00:23:10,880
How can a healthy person

531
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,280
die suddenly?

532
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:12,880
Exactly.

533
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:13,950
He's really out of luck.

534
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:15,040
The shoe on the ground

535
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:17,160
doesn't look like it fell off naturally
when he hanged himself.

536
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:18,760
The stains on his heels

537
00:23:18,950 --> 00:23:20,880
indicate that he might
have been dragged after death.

538
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,830
I also find it suspicious.

539
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,350
How could he commit suicide

540
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,470
right after we found him?

541
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:29,040
So the priority now

542
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:30,520
is to call in the coroner
for an autopsy.

543
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:36,110
I need to hurry back to the yamen.

544
00:23:36,430 --> 00:23:37,880
If I'm late, the body might be moved.

545
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:39,590
I won't leave

546
00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:40,880
until the case is solved.

547
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:42,470
As a woman,

548
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,070
I want to help your cousin too.

549
00:23:46,430 --> 00:23:49,430
Zhou Xian doesn't want this to blow up,

550
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:51,190
so he won't let the coroner in.

551
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:53,880
He'll also take it out on my cousin.

552
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Let me think about it.

553
00:24:14,070 --> 00:24:14,470
What are you doing?

554
00:24:14,470 --> 00:24:15,000
Young Master!

555
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:16,950
You're drooling!

556
00:24:17,310 --> 00:24:18,110
What's wrong, Young Master?

557
00:24:18,110 --> 00:24:18,710
Did you fall asleep

558
00:24:18,710 --> 00:24:20,070
after watching all night?

559
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,070
Go check it out!

560
00:24:42,350 --> 00:24:43,070
Luo Shu!

561
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:46,430
What are you doing here?

562
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:48,520
My young master is worried about you.

563
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:49,110
I stayed there with him

564
00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:50,520
for the night.

565
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:51,160
Get lost!

566
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:52,310
Alright then!

567
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,470
Have you finished up?
I'll take you back.

568
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:58,680
Not yet.

569
00:25:04,350 --> 00:25:05,110
I...

570
00:25:05,110 --> 00:25:06,430
Do I have something on my face?

571
00:25:07,350 --> 00:25:08,430
Can you help me out again?

572
00:25:08,830 --> 00:25:09,640
Sure.

573
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:40,430
Who is it?

574
00:26:00,950 --> 00:26:01,760
Who is it?

575
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,920
Who? Who is it?

576
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:43,640
It's unfair!

577
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:02,190
It's so unfair!

578
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:24,950
Have you heard the back yard was haunted?

579
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:26,310
So scary!

580
00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:27,880
Enough already, stop talking.

581
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:28,760
Let's get out of here!

582
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:29,560
It's haunted!

583
00:27:32,430 --> 00:27:33,310
So scary!

584
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:37,830
Who's making noise outside?

585
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:41,000
Mr. Zhou, and Yue!

586
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:41,830
It's a big deal!

587
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:43,350
Last night...

588
00:27:43,470 --> 00:27:44,520
Tell us quickly!

589
00:27:44,590 --> 00:27:45,400
Speak up!

590
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,760
Everyone is saying

591
00:27:47,830 --> 00:27:50,110
that Niu Dali died wronged,

592
00:27:50,470 --> 00:27:51,950
and last night
he turned into a vengeful ghost

593
00:27:52,950 --> 00:27:53,880
and came back!

594
00:27:54,190 --> 00:27:55,000
What?

595
00:27:56,830 --> 00:27:57,640
Change clothes!

596
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:59,950
If there's a grievance,
there's a reason!

597
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:02,800
If you really have a grievance,

598
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:04,880
you should find
the right person to blame.

599
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,760
Don't scare me!

600
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:08,350
I'll burn more joss paper for you.

601
00:28:08,950 --> 00:28:10,710
Just don't come after me!

602
00:28:12,710 --> 00:28:13,470
I've already said,

603
00:28:13,470 --> 00:28:14,710
no one is allowed to mention this again!

604
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:15,560
Mr. Zhou!

605
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:17,110
There's a ghost, Mr. Zhou!

606
00:28:17,110 --> 00:28:17,680
Mr. Zhou, there's a ghost!

607
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:18,310
What a mess!

608
00:28:18,310 --> 00:28:19,310
Hurry and drag him away!

609
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:21,310
Mr. Zhou, there really is a ghost!

610
00:28:21,310 --> 00:28:22,760
There's really a ghost, Mr. Zhou!

611
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:23,950
There's a ghost!

612
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:28,350
When are Yue's family coming?

613
00:28:28,710 --> 00:28:29,800
They said they'd arrive tomorrow.

614
00:28:35,350 --> 00:28:37,280
Ladies, please head back.

615
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:39,230
The atmosphere here is too heavy.

616
00:28:39,710 --> 00:28:41,040
I heard that last night,

617
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:42,800
Niu Dali's vengeful spirit came back?

618
00:28:44,350 --> 00:28:45,950
That's just
a misunderstanding by the servants.

619
00:28:45,950 --> 00:28:46,680
Nonsense!

620
00:28:47,070 --> 00:28:48,400
Don't take it seriously, ladies.

621
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,560
But the rumor sounds so convincing.

622
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,110
It's hard not to believe it.

623
00:28:56,430 --> 00:28:57,400
This is easy.

624
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:58,190
Leave it to me.

625
00:28:58,400 --> 00:28:59,110
What do you want to do?

626
00:28:59,350 --> 00:28:59,880
I read

627
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,680
about a trick in a magazine before.

628
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,280
It's a street con.

629
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:03,800
It says

630
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:04,920
if you smear eel blood

631
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,470
on the door at night,

632
00:29:06,470 --> 00:29:07,880
bats within a li

633
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:08,950
will come.

634
00:29:09,110 --> 00:29:09,880
You know that?

635
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:11,040
The sound of bats hitting the door

636
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,400
sounds just like knocking.

637
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,350
When the owners hear it,

638
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:14,640
they think someone is knocking.

639
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:15,470
When they open the door,

640
00:29:15,830 --> 00:29:16,830
the bats scatter.

641
00:29:17,070 --> 00:29:17,950
There's nobody outside,

642
00:29:17,950 --> 00:29:19,040
and with blood on the door,

643
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:20,710
they'll think it's haunted.

644
00:29:21,070 --> 00:29:21,920
After that,

645
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:23,350
all the con artists

646
00:29:23,350 --> 00:29:24,760
will pretend to be sorcerers,

647
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:26,560
coming to exorcise and extort money.

648
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:28,830
Great idea!

649
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:29,560
Let me tell you,

650
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:31,000
there's something even crazier.

651
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:37,640
Once you finish this ghost act,

652
00:29:37,710 --> 00:29:38,680
and they believe it,

653
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:39,590
then we can get Mr. Xu over

654
00:29:39,590 --> 00:29:40,520
to exorcise and perform rituals.

655
00:29:40,950 --> 00:29:42,400
I know a talented person.

656
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:45,160
How about
we ask him to come and do the rituals?

657
00:29:45,310 --> 00:29:46,760
He can definitely bring peace to you.

658
00:29:47,710 --> 00:29:49,350
We should avoid
talking about such things.

659
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:51,680
Miss Liu,
you're from a scholarly family.

660
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:52,950
How can you believe in these things?

661
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:55,560
Mr. Zhou,

662
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:57,680
may I add something?

663
00:29:57,950 --> 00:29:59,000
Miss Luo, please go ahead.

664
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:01,590
Mr. Zhou reads the classics,

665
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:03,920
and it's true that we shouldn't
believe in these things.

666
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,310
But Niu Dali's death

667
00:30:05,310 --> 00:30:06,560
is indeed suspicious.

668
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:08,400
Now another groom

669
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:09,920
has gone mad overnight.

670
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:11,640
If we ignore it,

671
00:30:11,830 --> 00:30:13,680
the people here will be anxious.

672
00:30:15,350 --> 00:30:16,590
For extraordinary matters,

673
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:18,350
we need extraordinary measures.

674
00:30:19,110 --> 00:30:20,560
We should also give all the weak here

675
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:21,590
some peace of mind.

676
00:30:23,070 --> 00:30:23,830
Right?

677
00:30:31,590 --> 00:30:32,470
But I wonder

678
00:30:32,470 --> 00:30:34,350
what kind of abilities

679
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:36,760
this talented person has.

680
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,800
My father's subordinate
has asked him for help before,

681
00:30:39,470 --> 00:30:40,760
so he does have some skills.

682
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:48,590
Thanks for your help, Miss Liu.

683
00:31:06,470 --> 00:31:09,280
Feet on the ground, head to the sky,

684
00:31:09,470 --> 00:31:12,040
with righteousness in my heart.

685
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:15,160
Every cause has its effect.

686
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:18,470
Evil in the world cannot be tolerated.

687
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:27,160
I will draw symbols on this body

688
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:29,280
to seal its vengeful energy.

689
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:34,400
The vengeful energy is strong.

690
00:31:35,470 --> 00:31:37,110
Everyone must stay away.

691
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:06,070
Someone is feeling guilty,

692
00:32:06,470 --> 00:32:07,830
worried her affair would be exposed.

693
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:09,190
That's why she took the risk

694
00:32:09,190 --> 00:32:10,590
to murder her lover.

695
00:32:10,710 --> 00:32:11,520
Yue.

696
00:32:11,710 --> 00:32:13,520
It's not certain who is feeling guilty.

697
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:14,920
As for the affair,

698
00:32:15,110 --> 00:32:15,800
it could be

699
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:18,190
someone related to Niu Dali

700
00:32:18,230 --> 00:32:19,230
tried to frame my cousin.

701
00:32:19,430 --> 00:32:20,920
Now the suspicion has fallen on her.

702
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:21,920
She is scared,

703
00:32:22,430 --> 00:32:25,070
so she decided to silence him.

704
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:26,190
You're talking nonsense!

705
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:28,070
What am I framing her for?

706
00:32:28,590 --> 00:32:29,520
That underwear

707
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:30,230
was definitely found

708
00:32:30,230 --> 00:32:31,230
under Mrs. Zhou's

709
00:32:31,230 --> 00:32:32,160
mattress.

710
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,310
Then report it to the authorities!

711
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:35,350
Let the officials come and investigate.

712
00:32:35,350 --> 00:32:36,680
It'll save us some trouble.

713
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:38,160
Report it to the authorities?

714
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:40,310
We can't let this scandal

715
00:32:40,310 --> 00:32:41,880
go to the officials.

716
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:42,830
How could we

717
00:32:42,950 --> 00:32:44,560
let everyone in Linfen know

718
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:45,350
that Mrs. Zhou is involved

719
00:32:45,350 --> 00:32:46,430
in murder and affairs?

720
00:32:47,310 --> 00:32:48,110
Mr. Zhou,

721
00:32:48,110 --> 00:32:48,800
the Zhou family

722
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,110
can't lose face like this.

723
00:32:50,110 --> 00:32:51,110
Let's stop talking about it.

724
00:32:51,710 --> 00:32:54,310
That groom committed suicide.

725
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:55,950
No one is to investigate further.

726
00:32:58,070 --> 00:32:58,880
Mr. Zhou.

727
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:00,110
Wenyin.

728
00:33:00,110 --> 00:33:00,800
Madam.

729
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:09,880
It must be her.

730
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:12,280
Other thieves steal things,

731
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,000
but she hid things

732
00:33:14,110 --> 00:33:15,710
under your mattress.

733
00:33:16,310 --> 00:33:17,800
I wonder how much

734
00:33:18,110 --> 00:33:19,470
Niu Dali got from her.

735
00:33:21,430 --> 00:33:22,230
Miss Luo,

736
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:24,880
I remembered something strange.

737
00:33:25,350 --> 00:33:26,310
Madam, please go ahead.

738
00:33:29,310 --> 00:33:30,190
Last month,

739
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:31,640
when I passed by

740
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:33,190
Yue's courtyard,

741
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:35,680
I saw her arguing

742
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,190
with Niu Dali.

743
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:39,880
Their relationship looked strange.

744
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:41,950
They didn't look like
master and servant,

745
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:44,710
or relatives.

746
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:47,680
She had been hiring someone then?

747
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:49,070
Or maybe

748
00:33:49,430 --> 00:33:52,040
Niu Dali had an affair with her?

749
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:56,680
Miss Luo,

750
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:57,830
I really don't know

751
00:33:57,830 --> 00:33:59,000
what to do now.

752
00:33:59,350 --> 00:34:01,070
Please reveal
your identity as a constable

753
00:34:01,070 --> 00:34:02,640
and arrest that woman.

754
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:03,880
You have to help me!

755
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:05,190
Yes,

756
00:34:05,430 --> 00:34:06,920
let's just arrest her.

757
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:09,520
Right now, it's all just speculation.

758
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,280
You're already in trouble.

759
00:34:11,710 --> 00:34:13,120
Just one person's word

760
00:34:13,150 --> 00:34:14,470
can't be taken as evidence.

761
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:16,840
So what should I do?

762
00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:19,470
Tomorrow, I'll look for a chance

763
00:34:19,470 --> 00:34:21,230
to check the groom's belongings.

764
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:22,560
Maybe there's a clue.

765
00:34:37,190 --> 00:34:37,910
Your Honor.

766
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:39,390
Where have you been?

767
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:41,360
I...

768
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:42,320
You went to see Luo Shu?

769
00:34:43,230 --> 00:34:43,800
Yes.

770
00:34:44,390 --> 00:34:45,320
Mr. Qi

771
00:34:45,630 --> 00:34:46,840
came to ask for leave for Luo Shu

772
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:48,760
and then sneakily called you over.

773
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:50,280
What are you up to?

774
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:55,630
I'm helping her
investigate the Zhou family case.

775
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:08,600
Your Honor, I didn't expect you to come.

776
00:35:08,950 --> 00:35:10,360
I should have welcomed you properly.

777
00:35:12,470 --> 00:35:13,600
Please have some tea.

778
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:29,520
I'm sorry

779
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:30,670
for the sudden visit.

780
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:32,670
I hope you can forgive me.

781
00:35:32,670 --> 00:35:33,470
Not at all.

782
00:35:34,430 --> 00:35:36,320
Last time you taught at the school,

783
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:38,520
I felt enlightened.

784
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:39,670
and benefited greatly.

785
00:35:39,950 --> 00:35:41,760
I was hoping you would come to visit.

786
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:46,470
But,

787
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:49,670
I wonder what you want

788
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:50,760
with Miss Liu.

789
00:35:57,630 --> 00:35:58,630
She's here.

790
00:36:10,870 --> 00:36:11,760
Miss Liu and I

791
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,320
have some personal matters to discuss.

792
00:36:18,190 --> 00:36:19,000
In that case,

793
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,430
I won't disturb you.

794
00:36:21,190 --> 00:36:22,760
Feel free to tell me
if you need anything.

795
00:36:40,230 --> 00:36:41,910
The magistrate is your cousin's fiancé?

796
00:36:41,910 --> 00:36:42,360
Such big news,

797
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:43,150
why have you never

798
00:36:43,150 --> 00:36:44,040
mentioned it to me?

799
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:45,360
Well,

800
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:47,120
this engagement
was just settled last year.

801
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:48,320
Besides, you've never been one

802
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:49,600
to chat with me.

803
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:50,870
How would I have had the chance

804
00:36:50,870 --> 00:36:52,080
to bring it up?

805
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:55,670
What can I say about you?

806
00:37:10,950 --> 00:37:12,040
Since you're still in Linfen,

807
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:13,280
why didn't you tell me?

808
00:37:13,470 --> 00:37:14,800
I was supposed to go back to Taiyuan

809
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,150
with my father.

810
00:37:16,710 --> 00:37:18,000
But my cousin
couldn't bear to see me go,

811
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,390
so she asked me to stay a few more days.

812
00:37:20,390 --> 00:37:22,360
You're busy
with official duties every day.

813
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:23,430
This little matter

814
00:37:23,430 --> 00:37:24,840
shouldn't bother you.

815
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:28,360
You and I have an agreement.

816
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:29,630
She doesn't know about it,

817
00:37:29,670 --> 00:37:31,150
so why are you
making things difficult for her?

818
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:32,630
You think

819
00:37:32,630 --> 00:37:33,670
I'm the one causing her trouble?

820
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:37,190
I'm the one who broke the agreement.

821
00:37:37,390 --> 00:37:38,150
If you're unhappy,

822
00:37:38,150 --> 00:37:39,190
you can come to me.

823
00:37:39,950 --> 00:37:41,670
There's no need to hold her back.

824
00:37:43,230 --> 00:37:43,910
Your Honor.

825
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:47,150
Luo Shu.

826
00:37:48,470 --> 00:37:50,120
I volunteered to help.

827
00:37:51,430 --> 00:37:52,150
How are you doing?

828
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:53,760
I'm doing just fine.

829
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:55,230
Mrs. Zhou has recently

830
00:37:55,230 --> 00:37:56,670
suffered an injustice.

831
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:57,600
It's not appropriate to discuss

832
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:59,040
women's matters with men.

833
00:37:59,470 --> 00:38:00,560
Miss Liu only knows me here

834
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:02,000
as a woman.

835
00:38:02,470 --> 00:38:03,870
It just so happens I'm a constable,

836
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:06,040
so she asked me in secret

837
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:07,320
for my opinion.

838
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:09,390
Of course, I'm willing to help.

839
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,280
You really don't need
to compromise yourself.

840
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,560
Miss Liu has treated me very well.

841
00:38:16,950 --> 00:38:18,520
You misunderstood her.

842
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:31,120
If that's the case,

843
00:38:32,470 --> 00:38:33,360
do as you wish.

844
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:42,800
Miss Liu and Wenyin are very close.

845
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:44,840
She often stays at my place.

846
00:38:51,230 --> 00:38:52,390
Recently, I've been

847
00:38:52,430 --> 00:38:54,390
reading Mr. Shouren's works again.

848
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:56,190
I have many questions.

849
00:38:56,670 --> 00:38:59,280
I wonder if I could ask you for guidance

850
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:00,800
when you have time.

851
00:39:01,710 --> 00:39:03,950
Sure, I'll take my leave for now.

852
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:07,560
Madam,

853
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:09,230
the magistrate is engaged to Liu Wan.

854
00:39:16,230 --> 00:39:17,430
He married Xue Wenyin

855
00:39:17,430 --> 00:39:18,870
just to get into office.

856
00:39:20,870 --> 00:39:21,840
Now his brother-in-law

857
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:23,150
is his superior.

858
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:26,710
He definitely won't divorce her.

859
00:39:34,430 --> 00:39:35,430
That bed inside

860
00:39:35,430 --> 00:39:36,760
belonged to Niu Dali.

861
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:37,870
All of his things

862
00:39:37,870 --> 00:39:38,910
are right there.

863
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:31,800
Why did a groom

864
00:40:31,870 --> 00:40:33,120
have so much money?

865
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:37,280
This box has some clothes in it,

866
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:38,230
but nothing else.

867
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:40,670
This was found here.

868
00:40:41,190 --> 00:40:42,080
What is it?

869
00:40:53,470 --> 00:40:54,840
The black one is Qirong Pill,

870
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:56,520
and the golden one is Zhongzi Pill.

871
00:40:58,630 --> 00:41:00,360
Was he from the incense hall?

872
00:41:05,230 --> 00:41:07,430
What kind of place is the incense hall?

873
00:41:08,190 --> 00:41:08,910
A group of bandits

874
00:41:08,910 --> 00:41:10,430
pretending to be sorcerers.

875
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,040
They used drugs on women

876
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:12,910
who went to seek help.

877
00:41:13,230 --> 00:41:15,560
Afterward,
they continued to extort money.

878
00:41:15,870 --> 00:41:16,670
Right.

879
00:41:17,430 --> 00:41:19,230
She did go to an incense hall

880
00:41:19,390 --> 00:41:20,760
deep in the mountains.

881
00:41:21,430 --> 00:41:23,040
Not long after that, she got pregnant.

882
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:23,760
I found it.

883
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:26,120
This is the Zhous' servant roster.

884
00:41:26,390 --> 00:41:27,320
I checked.

885
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:28,390
Niu Dali

886
00:41:28,870 --> 00:41:30,190
came here

887
00:41:30,190 --> 00:41:30,870
not long after the incense hall

888
00:41:30,870 --> 00:41:32,150
was wiped out.

889
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:33,630
So it means

890
00:41:34,390 --> 00:41:36,470
Yue is a victim of the incense hall,

891
00:41:36,950 --> 00:41:38,710
and Niu Dali is a fugitive.

892
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:42,150
No wonder

893
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:44,800
when Zhou Xian asked her

894
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:46,190
to notify his family
to collect the body,

895
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:47,950
she reacted that way.

896
00:41:47,950 --> 00:41:49,230
Call his family over

897
00:41:49,230 --> 00:41:50,080
and take him away.

898
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:52,470
Say he hanged himself.

899
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:56,520
Why are you just standing there?

900
00:41:56,870 --> 00:41:58,190
Wasn't he your family?

901
00:41:59,080 --> 00:41:59,870
Yes.

902
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:02,000
I'll send someone
to inform them right away.

903
00:42:03,230 --> 00:42:04,430
If I'm not mistaken,

904
00:42:04,710 --> 00:42:06,150
When Yue went to the incense hall,

905
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:06,870
she was violated

906
00:42:06,870 --> 00:42:08,230
by Niu Dali.

907
00:42:08,390 --> 00:42:10,150
And she was forced to give her address.

908
00:42:10,870 --> 00:42:11,670
Later,

909
00:42:12,230 --> 00:42:14,000
the incense hall was wiped out

910
00:42:14,470 --> 00:42:16,000
and Niu Dali escaped.

911
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:17,910
To avoid capture,

912
00:42:18,430 --> 00:42:19,840
he sought out Yue,

913
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:22,630
threatening her
to forge an identity for him

914
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:24,560
to get him into the Zhous' place.

915
00:42:27,950 --> 00:42:29,000
It must be so.

916
00:42:29,390 --> 00:42:30,910
The money Niu Dali had

917
00:42:30,950 --> 00:42:32,840
must have been extorted from Yue.

918
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:35,120
Yue forced him to frame you,

919
00:42:35,190 --> 00:42:36,320
and he didn't dare refuse.

920
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:37,430
Both of them

921
00:42:37,430 --> 00:42:39,000
held each other's secrets,

922
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:40,390
mutually wary.

923
00:42:40,910 --> 00:42:42,360
Perhaps Niu Dali

924
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:44,710
used that dirty business from before

925
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:46,040
to blackmail Yue again,

926
00:42:46,950 --> 00:42:48,150
and she couldn't take it anymore,

927
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:49,430
so she killed him.

928
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:53,670
Heaven has eyes;
evil gets its comeuppance.

929
00:42:53,910 --> 00:42:54,910
Evil gets its comeuppance.

930
00:42:55,950 --> 00:42:57,430
Justice will prevail.
