[Episode 14]

4
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,550
What are you doing up at this hour?

5
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:43,630
I'm just looking for something
to keep warm.

6
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:44,630
Who's there?

7
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:46,510
Who's chatting

8
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:47,550
over there?

9
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,190
Yue, it's you!

10
00:01:54,910 --> 00:01:56,160
What are you doing here so late?

11
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:00,800
It's pitch black.

12
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:01,630
Why did you come out?

13
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:04,440
The wind's howling in the woodshed.

14
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:05,550
I'm too cold to sleep.

15
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,440
So I came out to find something warm.

16
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:09,470
You're such a hassle.

17
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:10,080
Get lost.

18
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:20,440
Yue!

19
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:23,550
What do you want from me?

20
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,520
Did Wang Mao give you a hard time?

21
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,550
I didn't expect to see him here.

22
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:35,550
Who?

23
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:36,800
Bai Yue.

24
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,800
Yue, don't say that.

25
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,440
You and Gou

26
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,880
are big deal people.

27
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,270
Getting women should be easy for you.

28
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,550
So why are you coming to me?

29
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:48,030
That man next to Wang Mao
is Bai Yue, right?

30
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,750
I just go down the mountain
every now and then

31
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:52,960
to buy some groceries.

32
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:54,910
When it comes to getting women,

33
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,110
I'm way off.

34
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:59,960
I know Qian Sigou came to see you.

35
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,390
It's about this too.

36
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:03,390
The yamen
recently raided the secret route

37
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:05,270
Sigou used for kidnapping women.

38
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,110
Now he's out of supplies.

39
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:07,190
if I were

40
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,270
still in incense hall,

41
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,190
getting a pretty woman

42
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:12,750
would be easy.

43
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:14,600
But now,

44
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,080
I'm wanted by the yamen,

45
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,320
and the incense hall is no more.

46
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:19,360
So I can only hide in this mine.

47
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,550
Things are different now.

48
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,800
So when it comes to getting women,

49
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,320
I have to rely on you.

50
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,110
Come on,

51
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:32,080
you know

52
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,320
how Gou is.

53
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:34,600
He's always

54
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,600
on top of this stuff.

55
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:37,270
If I get a woman,

56
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:38,080
and do not share with him,

57
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:40,520
I won't be able to explain it to him.

58
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,550
You gave him the woman,

59
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:46,110
so that's settled, right?

60
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,320
But what do you

61
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,390
get out of it?

62
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,320
I...

63
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,440
Qian Sigou already has

64
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,360
Qian Dasong and Qian Jintian,

65
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,550
two tough guys with him.

66
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:55,160
Why would he speak up for you?

67
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,390
He just wants to use you.

68
00:03:57,470 --> 00:03:58,190
Once he's done with you,

69
00:03:58,190 --> 00:03:59,670
you're just trash.

70
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:01,550
Who's going to see you as a friend then?

71
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,000
Don't forget,

72
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:04,960
you're playing

73
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,960
with fire.

74
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:09,320
In the end,

75
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:11,000
you'll just be discarded like trash.

76
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:13,910
Yue,

77
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:15,910
what

78
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:18,670
can you offer me?

79
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,510
To Dayou,

80
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:22,440
I can't match

81
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:24,320
up to Qian Sigou,

82
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:25,670
But I

83
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:28,270
do genuinely consider you a friend.

84
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:29,880
Yeah.

85
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:30,950
You need to rely on Qian to survive

86
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:32,070
in the mine.

87
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,070
I need a chance

88
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:34,830
to prove myself to Dayou.

89
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:35,880
Of course,

90
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:38,480
I need to cultivate

91
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:40,830
my own loyal followers.

92
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:42,440
If we join forces,

93
00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:44,110
we can both get what we need.

94
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:46,000
Once I'm in a good position,

95
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,790
you won't have to serve anyone anymore.

96
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,320
Qian Sigou and his crew

97
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,230
will have to think twice.

98
00:04:52,670 --> 00:04:54,230
Are you going to keep your word?

99
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:55,510
I swear on my life.

100
00:04:58,070 --> 00:04:58,920
I'm with you.

101
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,230
True friend.

102
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:04,600
I'll wait for your message.

103
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,110
Alright.

104
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:07,230
I'm off.

105
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:14,040
Where did that woman come from?

106
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:17,550
Yue!

107
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:19,350
You mean the ugly one?

108
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:20,640
I hired her as a helper.

109
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:21,720
She just got here a couple of days ago.

110
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,790
You should be cautious,

111
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:25,790
especially with people

112
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:26,950
of unknown origin.

113
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,390
You need to check them carefully.

114
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,510
Don't worry, Yue.

115
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,920
I'm very thorough.

116
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:32,550
I'm off.

117
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:33,600
Take care.

118
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:36,760
They've kidnapped

119
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:37,320
so many women already.

120
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:38,110
Isn't that enough?

121
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:39,950
Maybe they have some special use.

122
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,510
They're too bold.

123
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:43,160
We can't let this go.

124
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:45,070
We need to inform Han Muzhi ASAP.

125
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:46,950
There will be more women
going missing soon.

126
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:48,760
That storeroom is suspicious.

127
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:49,830
What's the issue?

128
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:51,550
I heard noises inside.

129
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:52,830
Someone's locked in there.

130
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:53,950
Not sure yet.

131
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:55,200
We need to find a chance
to check it out.

132
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,110
Wang Mao is here.

133
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:08,510
We're a couple now.

134
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,270
Mao.

135
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,270
Stop wandering around outside.

136
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:27,790
Did you hear me?

137
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:30,640
I heard you.

138
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:39,950
Thanks, Mao.

139
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:43,270
Keep sleeping.

140
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:52,640
This night

141
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:55,600
was too intense.

142
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,000
I...

143
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,350
Why are you pushing me?

144
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:25,550
You were out of line.

145
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:27,320
Wasn't that you

146
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,200
who pulled me up earlier?

147
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,110
And what about now?

148
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,830
You can't half-ass a show.

149
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:33,480
What if Wang Mao

150
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,510
comes back?

151
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,270
Have all the people for Mantian Ridge

152
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:03,230
arranged?

153
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:04,160
It's all set.

154
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:04,790
Twenty people,

155
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:06,550
all strong and skilled.

156
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:06,950
Good.

157
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,110
Let them rest early tonight.

158
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:10,790
We'll head out tomorrow morning.

159
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:12,160
Yes.

160
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,110
Wait a second.

161
00:08:13,390 --> 00:08:14,200
What do you mean

162
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:16,160
we'll head out tomorrow morning?

163
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,040
I mean

164
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,720
I should be the one to go this time.

165
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:27,440
No way.

166
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:28,790
How can you go?

167
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:29,920
Zao Hua is my wife.

168
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:30,480
Then what about

169
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,200
Qian Dayou?

170
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,000
You said he was too arrogant.

171
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,350
You're just a deputy magistrate.

172
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:38,440
I'm worried you can't handle him.

173
00:08:38,590 --> 00:08:39,400
Muzhi,

174
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,400
this mission's success

175
00:08:41,470 --> 00:08:43,200
depends on you convincing Mr. Liu

176
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,790
and getting the censorial officials
on our side

177
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:46,000
to impeach Eunuch Zhang.

178
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:47,760
Only you can do it.

179
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:48,880
Our safety

180
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,150
depends on it.

181
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:53,110
I understand your intentions.

182
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:55,280
But don't let emotions
cloud your judgment.

183
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,670
Think about the bigger picture.

184
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:03,520
Well.

185
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,200
You all must be careful.

186
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,080
Don't worry.

187
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,110
Meiqing.

188
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:19,150
Take good care of Luo Shu.

189
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:23,320
Okay.

190
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,320
What are you doing?

191
00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:39,550
Look at this.

192
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,760
Isn't this that kid who herds sheep?

193
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,470
Here, take this.

194
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:48,150
Alright, go on.

195
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:54,440
He's gone too.

196
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:10,000
You blind idiots.

197
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:12,880
You don't know who he is?

198
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:17,710
I didn't recognize you.

199
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,910
Mr Chen, if you have any orders,

200
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:22,440
I will certainly comply.

201
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:23,760
That's fine.

202
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:26,520
Hand over my fiancée.

203
00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:28,840
What?

204
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:29,790
His fiancée?

205
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:31,200
The mine is full of men.

206
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,960
He came here
looking for his fiancée?

207
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,790
How can I

208
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,790
hand your fiancée over?

209
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:39,590
A few days ago,
my fiancée went missing.

210
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:41,000
Someone found her belongings

211
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,710
at your mine.

212
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:47,550
So you tell me,

213
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,470
should I come here to look for her?

214
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,470
I'm so wronged!

215
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:52,590
I haven't seen a single hair

216
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:53,840
of her.

217
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:54,710
You haven't?

218
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:57,230
With all those thugs in your mine,

219
00:10:57,550 --> 00:10:59,000
can you guarantee

220
00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:00,520
their actions?

221
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,000
Mr. Chen,

222
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:11,840
what should I do

223
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:14,590
to make you believe me?

224
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:15,960
A search will tell you.

225
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:16,790
Search.

226
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:17,520
Wait a second.

227
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:23,840
Mr. Chen,

228
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,760
last time you disguised as a merchant

229
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:26,910
and wandered around my mine.

230
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:28,670
Now you want to search my mine

231
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:29,790
over a single item?

232
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:31,790
What do you really want?

233
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:35,320
If you are tight on money,

234
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:37,110
just say the word.

235
00:11:37,150 --> 00:11:38,590
I'm a reasonable man.

236
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:39,760
You're overthinking it.

237
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,840
Mr. Qian, you keep obstructing me.

238
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:44,440
Is there

239
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:46,200
truly something fishy here?

240
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:48,280
Search for me.

241
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:49,840
Guys, search!

242
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:50,710
Yes!

243
00:11:58,880 --> 00:11:59,670
Mr. Chen.

244
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:14,910
What's the result?

245
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:18,150
Mr. Chen, we've searched everywhere.

246
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:18,790
Nothing unusual.

247
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,710
It's a misunderstanding.

248
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:28,710
Mr. Chen,

249
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:30,520
I told you there's nothing, right?

250
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:31,670
Now do you believe me?

251
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:32,910
You should

252
00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:34,400
look elsewhere

253
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:35,550
for your fiancée.

254
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:36,840
Go find her somewhere else.

255
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:38,670
Go look for her elsewhere.

256
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,760
Find her somewhere else.

257
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,470
Go look for her elsewhere.

258
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:45,030
You won't find her here.

259
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:46,470
No need to rush.

260
00:12:47,150 --> 00:12:48,470
Once I finish my business,

261
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:49,670
I'll look elsewhere.

262
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,110
Business?

263
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:54,280
What business

264
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:56,230
do you have at my mine?

265
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:06,030
By order of Magistrate Han,

266
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,280
I am here to audit the accounts
of Mantian Ridge Coal Mine.

267
00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:16,200
Mr. Chen, this mine

268
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:18,470
is under Eunuch Zhang's control.

269
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:20,110
His Majesty has issued a decree.

270
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:21,440
Taxes from the mine

271
00:13:21,470 --> 00:13:23,110
are collected by local yamen.

272
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,790
Have you paid a single liang of silver?

273
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:26,350
The previous magistrate...

274
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:27,280
Listen carefully,

275
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:28,790
the current magistrate
is Magistrate Han.

276
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:30,840
He does everything in accordance
with His Majesty's orders

277
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:32,590
and the laws of the court.

278
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:36,080
We'll be staying at the mine's inn.

279
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,320
You have half an hour

280
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:40,030
to bring all the accounts to me.

281
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:45,440
Mr. Chen,

282
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,960
are you trying

283
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,110
to go against Eunuch Zhang?

284
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:51,280
I'm just doing my job.

285
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:52,150
Alright.

286
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:55,030
If you want to stay, I won't stop you.

287
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:56,640
But this mine

288
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:58,440
often has little accidents.

289
00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:01,550
When you and your subordinates

290
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:02,960
roam around,

291
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:06,840
if you get hurt, disabled,

292
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:08,670
or worse,

293
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,670
don't blame me.

294
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:13,350
Are you threatening me?

295
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:14,840
Not at all.

296
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:18,230
I'm just giving you a friendly warning.

297
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:20,200
Half an hour isn't long.

298
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,640
You should hurry

299
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,150
with the accounts.

300
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:24,350
Let's go.

301
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:35,640
Get to work.

302
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:36,840
Don't slack off!

303
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:39,280
Work, work, work!

304
00:14:47,230 --> 00:14:48,880
You four stay here.

305
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,470
The rest of you, go search over there.

306
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:51,110
Yes.

307
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,320
Watch them closely.

308
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:03,350
Don't let them run away.

309
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:04,400
Yes.

310
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:08,590
What should we do?

311
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:10,000
We don't

312
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,520
have any chance to get in.

313
00:15:12,590 --> 00:15:13,350
Mr. Chen

314
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:14,760
just saw us.

315
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:15,640
He'll definitely look for a chance

316
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:16,760
to meet up with us.

317
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:23,470
Get to work.

318
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:33,790
Captain Cai!

319
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:35,960
Mr. Qi and Luo Shu

320
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,440
were just in the crowd.

321
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,910
You need to find a way to meet them.

322
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:39,960
Yes.

323
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:57,200
Officer,

324
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:58,440
where are you going?

325
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:00,110
It is none of your business.

326
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,520
You dare block my way?

327
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:03,760
Get lost!

328
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:07,670
Um...

329
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:13,350
Captain Cai is out.

330
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,080
He's out.

331
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:29,960
Go over there.

332
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:15,830
Qian Yue,

333
00:17:16,590 --> 00:17:17,680
you used to be

334
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:19,160
in the women's business.

335
00:17:19,430 --> 00:17:21,160
Tell me the truth, was it you?

336
00:17:22,110 --> 00:17:22,920
Uncle,

337
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,800
I'm a wanted man.

338
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,590
I don't even dare to step outside.

339
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,350
Where would I find those women?

340
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:30,470
Since I got to this mine,

341
00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:31,920
I haven't gone out at all.

342
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:44,950
No.

343
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:46,350
Since the White Ant was taken down,

344
00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:48,000
none of us have left.

345
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:49,280
Dayou, I swear,

346
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:50,950
if I had kidnapped that woman,

347
00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:52,310
let the heavens strike me down!

348
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:53,230
Right?

349
00:17:56,430 --> 00:17:58,000
I didn't! I swear!

350
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:03,280
I swear

351
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:05,070
I haven't gone out.

352
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:06,680
Haven't gone out.

353
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:12,400
So who did it

354
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,920
to harm me!

355
00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:18,920
I'm telling you,

356
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,040
that Mr. Chen

357
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:24,560
won't leave these days.

358
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:27,830
You all better be careful.

359
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:30,830
And you,

360
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:32,920
don't think because you're handsome,

361
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:34,160
you can show your face everywhere.

362
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,760
If the yamen pin a charge

363
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,070
of harboring a criminal on me,

364
00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:38,160
I'm doomed.

365
00:18:38,830 --> 00:18:40,040
Yes, Uncle.

366
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:41,350
I'll definitely hide well.

367
00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:46,040
Dayou,

368
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:48,190
what about the person
Eunuch Zhang wants?

369
00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:49,280
Should we still look for her?

370
00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:52,560
It's a sensitive time right now.

371
00:18:53,230 --> 00:18:55,310
Maybe we should lay low.

372
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,590
Yeah, lay low.

373
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:58,430
Take it easy.

374
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,400
Keep looking.

375
00:19:05,430 --> 00:19:06,560
Not only look for her,

376
00:19:06,590 --> 00:19:08,280
we need to find her quickly.

377
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:10,680
Now, at this sensitive time,

378
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,430
we can't afford to neglect Eunuch Zhang.

379
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:14,430
Without his support,

380
00:19:14,430 --> 00:19:15,560
we'll all be finished

381
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:17,310
and won't be able
to get through this hurdle.

382
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:19,070
Quick, send a message to Eunuch Zhang.

383
00:19:19,190 --> 00:19:21,280
Tell him Mr. Chen
is checking the accounts.

384
00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:22,520
Yes.

385
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,310
What are you waiting? Just go!

386
00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:25,070
I'll go now.

387
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:54,280
Wang Mao!

388
00:19:58,710 --> 00:19:59,470
Gou, Yue,

389
00:19:59,470 --> 00:20:00,640
you came to get the food yourself?

390
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:03,160
Did the human trafficker reply?

391
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:06,230
Not yet.

392
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:07,920
I'm anxious too.

393
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,230
There's no point in being anxious.

394
00:20:09,230 --> 00:20:09,920
You should hurry him up.

395
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,070
Dayou is waiting.

396
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:12,640
The food in the pot is for the women.

397
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:13,760
The separate bowl

398
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:14,640
is for whom?

399
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:16,680
Let me check.

400
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,070
Yes, Gou.

401
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:22,160
Finding a woman shouldn't be hard,

402
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:24,640
but why do you need a tough one?

403
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,230
A tough one doesn't listen

404
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:28,710
and might not sell well later.

405
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,350
She isn't for sale,

406
00:20:30,350 --> 00:20:31,640
but she's meant to be a gift to someone,

407
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:32,830
tailored to their preferences.

408
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:35,400
Such an important matter!

409
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,070
Okay, I'll keep a close eye on it.

410
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:38,430
I'll let you know if I hear anything.

411
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:39,590
Wang Mao, listen up.

412
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:42,040
Get this done as soon as you can.

413
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:42,680
Then we can speak

414
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:44,590
to Dayou on your behalf.

415
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:45,710
Okay, got it.

416
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:49,640
Alright, We're off.

417
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:50,160
Okay!

418
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:51,160
Come back!

419
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:51,920
Take care!

420
00:20:58,640 --> 00:20:59,310
You two,

421
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:00,800
go clean the manure.

422
00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:02,230
Clean the manure.

423
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:03,760
Mao,

424
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:05,830
we can cook dinner first.

425
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:06,760
Cleaning can wait.

426
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:07,880
It won't take long.

427
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:09,470
Just do what I say.

428
00:21:09,590 --> 00:21:10,760
No need for so much talk.

429
00:21:11,190 --> 00:21:12,000
Go!

430
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:13,520
Let's go!

431
00:21:15,230 --> 00:21:16,160
Stop by the pigpen

432
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:17,230
and feed the pigs.

433
00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:17,920
Okay.

434
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:22,710
Stop right there.

435
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:39,230
Turn around.

436
00:21:41,190 --> 00:21:42,520
I'm ugly.

437
00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:44,040
I didn't want to scare you.

438
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:46,710
Turn around, hurry up!

439
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:56,880
Sorry, sorry!

440
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:57,760
What are you doing?

441
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:58,520
Sorry, let me wipe that.

442
00:21:58,520 --> 00:21:59,350
Let me wipe it.

443
00:21:59,350 --> 00:22:00,310
I'll get a cloth.

444
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:01,430
What are you doing?

445
00:22:01,470 --> 00:22:02,400
Be careful!

446
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,190
Get lost!

447
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:07,920
Yue!

448
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:09,470
Yue!

449
00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:11,350
Why are you back?

450
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:15,560
Yue, did you need something?

451
00:22:21,430 --> 00:22:22,800
What's this about?

452
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:24,800
Take these for now.

453
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,000
There will be more later.

454
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:28,280
We've got some clues

455
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:30,280
on the tough woman.

456
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,560
Thanks for your help.

457
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,430
Let me know when you find her.

458
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:34,640
Don't worry, Yue.

459
00:22:35,070 --> 00:22:35,830
I'm off.

460
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:36,470
Okay!

461
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:39,160
Take care, Yue.

462
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:42,280
Hurry up and finish before cleaning.

463
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:50,830
No way.

464
00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:54,000
That was a close call.

465
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:55,800
Lucky to get past it.

466
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:56,760
What if it happens again?

467
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:57,950
Will we be that lucky again?

468
00:22:58,310 --> 00:22:58,920
No, no, no!

469
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,230
It's too dangerous.

470
00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:01,880
You should head back.

471
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:02,350
Even meeting with Mr. Chen

472
00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:04,110
would be fine.

473
00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:08,280
I'm talking to you!

474
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:11,560
Don't you feel

475
00:23:12,230 --> 00:23:13,040
Wang Mao is purposely

476
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:14,190
sending us away?

477
00:23:14,190 --> 00:23:15,000
I didn't mention that.

478
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:15,880
The important thing now is...

479
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,280
What his motive is.

480
00:23:17,950 --> 00:23:18,830
I need to check it out.

481
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:22,640
You're a woman.

482
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:24,310
Why are you acting so reckless?

483
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:26,400
Zao Hua.

484
00:26:38,190 --> 00:26:38,710
Zao Hua.

485
00:26:39,470 --> 00:26:40,000
Zao Hua.

486
00:26:50,230 --> 00:26:51,070
Don't worry.

487
00:26:51,230 --> 00:26:52,000
We'll find a way

488
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:52,680
to get you out.

489
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:43,710
Is Wang Mao here?

490
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:45,590
Yes, he is.

491
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:47,070
Take me to him.

492
00:27:49,350 --> 00:27:50,160
Wang Mao!

493
00:27:51,310 --> 00:27:52,710
Wang Mao!

494
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:54,590
Wang Mao, Wang Mao!

495
00:27:59,230 --> 00:28:00,400
Aren't you supposed
to be cleaning manure?

496
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:01,230
Why are you back?

497
00:28:02,110 --> 00:28:03,880
I suddenly had a bad stomach ache.

498
00:28:04,190 --> 00:28:05,640
So I came back for some water.

499
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:12,190
What's going on?

500
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:13,950
I came to get the food

501
00:28:13,950 --> 00:28:15,110
for the yamen officials.

502
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:15,950
It's not ready yet.

503
00:28:15,950 --> 00:28:17,310
There are several batches today.

504
00:28:17,310 --> 00:28:18,760
They need to come in turns.

505
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:19,470
Right?

506
00:28:19,470 --> 00:28:20,230
Just wait a bit.

507
00:28:20,230 --> 00:28:21,350
Make it quick, though.

508
00:28:21,350 --> 00:28:21,830
Alright, alright.

509
00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:23,190
The officials are waiting over there.

510
00:28:24,230 --> 00:28:25,040
Where are you going?

511
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,430
I'm going back to clean manure.

512
00:28:26,430 --> 00:28:27,190
What manure are you cleaning?

513
00:28:27,190 --> 00:28:28,470
Can't you see I'm swamped?

514
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:29,350
Come help me out.

515
00:28:39,230 --> 00:28:39,710
Here.

516
00:28:46,310 --> 00:28:47,590
Can't carry all this, can you?

517
00:28:47,590 --> 00:28:48,880
Let me help you with some.

518
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:49,470
Okay!

519
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:51,950
You still need

520
00:28:51,950 --> 00:28:53,310
to come with me to the mine
to distribute food.

521
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,000
If we're late,

522
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,000
the miners won't let us off easy.

523
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:02,800
Okay.

524
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:03,520
Go back.

525
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:10,070
Get in and work.

526
00:29:26,430 --> 00:29:27,400
The food's here!

527
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:30,000
The food's served!

528
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:30,830
The food's here!

529
00:29:35,950 --> 00:29:37,000
One at a time!

530
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:37,800
Where are you going?

531
00:29:41,590 --> 00:29:42,470
Help me out.

532
00:29:59,430 --> 00:30:00,040
You're back!

533
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:01,110
Stay away from me.

534
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:03,190
I smell terrible, really bad.

535
00:30:03,430 --> 00:30:04,560
You'll choke on it!

536
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:07,470
I found Zao Hua!

537
00:30:08,350 --> 00:30:09,040
Really?

538
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:10,110
Where?

539
00:30:10,190 --> 00:30:11,590
In the cellar of the storeroom.

540
00:30:12,350 --> 00:30:13,310
Just as We thought.

541
00:30:14,070 --> 00:30:15,430
Let's go rescue her tonight!

542
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:18,830
We should contact Mr. Chen first.

543
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:22,710
Thanks for your hard work.

544
00:30:24,310 --> 00:30:25,110
Thank you.

545
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:27,070
Thank me?

546
00:30:27,230 --> 00:30:27,950
If it weren't for you

547
00:30:27,950 --> 00:30:28,760
dumping a bucket of pig feed

548
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:30,160
on Bai Yue,

549
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:31,880
I might have been discovered.

550
00:30:33,590 --> 00:30:34,680
You're becoming more thorough

551
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:35,950
in what you do.

552
00:30:36,590 --> 00:30:37,520
You're almost like

553
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:38,800
a Deputy Commandant now.

554
00:30:39,230 --> 00:30:40,310
Of course.

555
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,040
Remember last time?

556
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:43,190
At the mine,

557
00:30:43,190 --> 00:30:44,400
when we were meeting with Captain Cai?

558
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:45,560
If I hadn't spotted the two men first,

559
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:46,560
we would've been caught.

560
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:47,280
It really stinks.

561
00:30:49,110 --> 00:30:49,830
Yeah, it stinks.

562
00:30:49,950 --> 00:30:50,920
It's really bad.

563
00:31:04,430 --> 00:31:05,590
He's finally back.

564
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:07,430
I couldn't find a chance during the day.

565
00:31:07,710 --> 00:31:09,110
Now I'm off to see Mr. Chen.

566
00:31:09,310 --> 00:31:10,400
Keep an eye on Wang Mao.

567
00:31:10,430 --> 00:31:11,350
Don't let him find out

568
00:31:11,350 --> 00:31:12,000
that I'm gone.

569
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:12,590
Okay.

570
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:15,760
Be careful.

571
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:41,310
We didn't find Zao Hua

572
00:31:41,430 --> 00:31:42,830
nor did we get in touch with Luo Shu.

573
00:31:42,950 --> 00:31:43,800
So, are we left with no choice

574
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:45,350
but to start with these ledgers?

575
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:47,590
Since Qian Dayou
can send the ledgers over,

576
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:49,190
he must have tampered with them.

577
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,190
We can't find anything.

578
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:56,680
Then,

579
00:31:57,350 --> 00:31:58,680
tomorrow the others and I

580
00:31:58,680 --> 00:31:59,110
will split up

581
00:31:59,110 --> 00:32:00,280
to search for Luo Shu at the mine.

582
00:32:03,310 --> 00:32:04,590
With Luo Shu's smarts,

583
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:05,950
since she knows we're here,

584
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:07,880
she'll find a way to contact us.

585
00:32:08,710 --> 00:32:11,430
What if she ran into trouble?

586
00:32:23,070 --> 00:32:23,880
Captain Cai!

587
00:32:24,470 --> 00:32:25,880
Looks like you need
to take a few men out

588
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:27,040
to stir things up.

589
00:32:27,470 --> 00:32:28,000
Okay.

590
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:42,070
What's going on?

591
00:32:42,070 --> 00:32:42,680
Officers,

592
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:44,000
where are you headed?

593
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:44,710
Do we need

594
00:32:44,710 --> 00:32:45,760
to report to you?

595
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:46,880
I'm just following orders.

596
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:48,310
Whose orders are you following?

597
00:32:48,310 --> 00:32:48,880
Move aside.

598
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,280
Don't make it hard for us.

599
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:51,190
What's the deal?

600
00:32:51,710 --> 00:32:53,040
Today, we just feel frustrated,

601
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:54,310
and we're going
to make things difficult for you.

602
00:32:54,310 --> 00:32:54,830
Move aside!

603
00:32:54,830 --> 00:32:55,470
Step aside!

604
00:32:55,470 --> 00:32:56,680
Why are you so aggressive?

605
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:58,230
Why are you yelling like that?

606
00:32:58,560 --> 00:32:59,400
Step aside!

607
00:32:59,470 --> 00:33:00,000
What's going on?

608
00:33:00,310 --> 00:33:00,830
What's up?

609
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:01,680
Who dares stop me?

610
00:33:07,470 --> 00:33:08,310
Why are you so fierce?

611
00:33:08,310 --> 00:33:09,590
I'm fierce with you, so what?

612
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:10,830
Do you know whose turf is this?

613
00:33:10,830 --> 00:33:11,590
I don't care.

614
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:12,760
Do you even know who I am?

615
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:15,760
Not satisfied?

616
00:33:15,950 --> 00:33:16,830
If you're not,
let's take it somewhere else

617
00:33:16,830 --> 00:33:17,590
and have a go.

618
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:23,230
I'm scared of you?

619
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:31,040
I found Zao Hua!

620
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:31,950
Where is she?

621
00:33:32,350 --> 00:33:33,400
In the cellar.

622
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:34,470
I'll rally some people right now

623
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:35,520
to rescue everyone

624
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:36,310
and catch Qian Dayou,

625
00:33:36,310 --> 00:33:37,310
that scoundrel.

626
00:33:37,310 --> 00:33:38,000
No, we can't.

627
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:39,830
The cellar only has her.

628
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:41,640
What about the others?

629
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:43,070
I don't know where they are.

630
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:44,190
But if we keep an eye

631
00:33:44,190 --> 00:33:45,800
on Qian Sigou delivering food
to the women,

632
00:33:45,830 --> 00:33:47,160
we'll surely find them.

633
00:33:53,950 --> 00:33:55,310
Actually, rescuing Zao Hua first

634
00:33:55,310 --> 00:33:56,230
isn't a bad idea.

635
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:58,160
It might shock Qian Dayou,

636
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:00,280
and then we can catch Qian Sigou
and the others

637
00:34:00,350 --> 00:34:01,110
to force them to confess.

638
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:05,680
No.

639
00:34:06,310 --> 00:34:07,400
We can't act recklessly.

640
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,360
Muzhi is under pressure this time,

641
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:13,710
taking big risks.

642
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,430
What if Sigou and his crew

643
00:34:15,430 --> 00:34:16,520
stick to their story?

644
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:18,120
And if we can't find

645
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:19,390
the other kidnapped women,

646
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:21,950
we'll be in a tough spot.

647
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:26,910
Qi Menglin and I

648
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:28,800
will keep an eye on Zao Hua's situation.

649
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:30,120
She's safe for now.

650
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,120
By the way,

651
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:35,080
why does Qian Dayou

652
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:35,710
want to hide Zaohua

653
00:34:35,710 --> 00:34:36,950
and the others

654
00:34:36,950 --> 00:34:38,190
separately?

655
00:34:39,670 --> 00:34:41,230
It's not Qian Dayou
who kidnapped Zao Hua.

656
00:34:41,630 --> 00:34:42,520
It was Wang Mao.

657
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:43,430
What?

658
00:34:43,710 --> 00:34:44,630
Wang Mao?

659
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:17,430
We're a couple now.

660
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:46,800
Qian Dayou provides beautiful women

661
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,080
for Eunuch Zhang

662
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:49,560
to please the powerful,

663
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:50,520
securing his position.

664
00:35:50,630 --> 00:35:51,390
And Eunuch Zhang

665
00:35:51,390 --> 00:35:52,760
offers him protection,

666
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:53,760
keeping him wealthy.

667
00:35:55,910 --> 00:35:57,040
If that's true,

668
00:35:57,470 --> 00:35:58,430
we might find

669
00:35:58,430 --> 00:35:59,360
crucial evidence

670
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:01,120
to help Muzhi make progress.

671
00:36:02,390 --> 00:36:03,320
But why

672
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:04,760
did Wang Mao kidnap Zao Hua?

673
00:36:06,630 --> 00:36:07,190
Maybe it's because

674
00:36:07,190 --> 00:36:09,040
he heard from Qian Sigou

675
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,120
that Qian Dayou wants

676
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:11,560
a beautiful and fierce woman,

677
00:36:11,710 --> 00:36:12,600
and thought he had

678
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:14,040
a chance to make a name for himself.

679
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:15,280
And Zao Hua

680
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:17,000
who often herds sheep on Mantian Ridge,

681
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:18,230
is beautiful and fierce,

682
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:19,360
so she caught his eye.

683
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:21,280
If that's the case,

684
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:23,280
trying to leverage Zao Hua's situation

685
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,600
against Qian Dayou

686
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:27,000
would be risky.

687
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,280
Tomorrow, let Captain Cai

688
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:29,870
send someone to keep an eye
on Qian Sigou.

689
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:30,950
Follow the leads

690
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:31,840
and see if we can find

691
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:33,360
the hiding place of the missing women.

692
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:35,710
Alright, I'll handle that.

693
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:36,600
By the way,

694
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:39,670
there's someone hiding in this mine

695
00:36:39,670 --> 00:36:40,870
we didn't expect.

696
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:43,000
Who?

697
00:36:43,230 --> 00:36:44,000
Do you remember

698
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:44,600
the first case

699
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:45,600
we worked on together?

700
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:46,520
The incense hall case?

701
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:47,600
Right.

702
00:36:47,870 --> 00:36:49,470
It's that runaway disciple,

703
00:36:49,470 --> 00:36:50,000
Bai Yue.

704
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,560
What? Bai Yue is in the mine?

705
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:55,390
Then you can't go back.

706
00:36:55,390 --> 00:36:56,080
It's too dangerous.

707
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:57,230
You need to get out fast.

708
00:36:57,230 --> 00:36:57,910
No way.

709
00:36:58,150 --> 00:36:59,120
If I leave,

710
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:00,080
what about Zao Hua?

711
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:01,560
What about the other kidnapped women?

712
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:02,710
I can't let everything fail

713
00:37:02,710 --> 00:37:03,710
just because of me.

714
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:05,150
But he'll recognize you.

715
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:06,800
Don't worry.

716
00:37:07,190 --> 00:37:08,600
With how I look now,

717
00:37:08,630 --> 00:37:09,360
he won't recognize me

718
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:10,430
for a while.

719
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,320
You mustn't take risks.

720
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:13,470
If there's danger,

721
00:37:13,470 --> 00:37:14,430
run to me quickly.

722
00:37:14,430 --> 00:37:15,760
At least I can protect you.

723
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:17,360
If something happens to you,

724
00:37:17,470 --> 00:37:18,910
I won't be able to explain it to Muzhi.

725
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:22,870
Bai Yue.

726
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:25,760
With such a great opportunity,

727
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:28,390
I should go find Qian Dayou tomorrow

728
00:37:28,390 --> 00:37:29,320
for a drink.

729
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:30,320
Drink.

730
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:31,870
Qian Dayou has been

731
00:37:31,870 --> 00:37:32,800
very wary of me lately.

732
00:37:32,910 --> 00:37:34,560
It shows his panic.

733
00:37:34,630 --> 00:37:35,600
Hiding a fugitive

734
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:37,040
is his soft spot right now.

735
00:37:37,390 --> 00:37:38,320
So,

736
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:39,560
it's the perfect time to lure him

737
00:37:39,710 --> 00:37:40,760
and apply pressure,

738
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:41,760
completely disrupting him

739
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:42,630
and forcing him to slip up.

740
00:37:43,390 --> 00:37:45,000
You're truly strategic.

741
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:46,080
You can rest assured.

742
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:47,670
I'll keep a close watch on Zao Hua.

743
00:37:47,670 --> 00:37:48,760
I won't let anything happen to her.

744
00:37:49,910 --> 00:37:50,600
Thank you.

745
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,000
I'll take my leave now.

746
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:54,600
Luo Shu.

747
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:57,630
I'm sorry.

748
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:02,630
I've hindered you and Muzhi.

749
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:04,600
You didn't resent me at all,

750
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:06,120
and you're willing

751
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:07,630
to risk it to help me save Zao Hua.

752
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:10,520
I truly...

753
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:11,230
We were just

754
00:38:11,230 --> 00:38:12,760
doing what we should.

755
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:14,800
Actually,

756
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:16,870
you really care about Zao Hua,

757
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:17,710
right?

758
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:46,430
I was wondering
why you looked so familiar.

759
00:39:46,950 --> 00:39:48,600
It's really you!

760
00:39:50,470 --> 00:39:51,080
You!

761
00:39:52,630 --> 00:39:53,840
Let me go!

762
00:39:54,150 --> 00:39:55,840
I'll act like I never saw you.

763
00:39:56,230 --> 00:39:57,870
I won't report you.

764
00:39:58,670 --> 00:39:59,670
It's been a while.

765
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,430
You're still such a good liar, huh?

766
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:04,760
You ruined incense hall,

767
00:40:04,950 --> 00:40:06,600
and now I'm a fugitive.

768
00:40:06,670 --> 00:40:08,280
I didn't expect

769
00:40:08,910 --> 00:40:10,320
that you would fall right into my hands.

770
00:40:10,670 --> 00:40:12,360
Thank god!

771
00:40:15,190 --> 00:40:16,760
I'll hand you over to Qian Dayou.

772
00:40:16,910 --> 00:40:17,760
Tell him

773
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:19,870
you're a spy sent by the yamen.

774
00:40:19,870 --> 00:40:21,670
What do you think he'll do to you?

775
00:40:21,870 --> 00:40:23,840
Will he reward me for this?

776
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:25,910
I'll make you

777
00:40:25,910 --> 00:40:27,870
pay back everything you owe me.

778
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:29,390
I'm going to make you pay.

779
00:42:30,950 --> 00:42:32,080
This kind of skull fracture

780
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:33,710
with no other wounds

781
00:42:33,950 --> 00:42:34,910
can be determined to be

782
00:42:34,910 --> 00:42:36,630
caused by blunt force trauma.

783
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,470
Where have you been?

784
00:42:44,630 --> 00:42:45,760
You scared me!

785
00:42:46,710 --> 00:42:48,040
You really had me worried.

786
00:42:49,230 --> 00:42:50,320
If you were any later,

787
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:51,760
I would've gone looking for Mr. Chen.

788
00:42:52,670 --> 00:42:53,470
Where's your false teeth?

789
00:42:55,190 --> 00:42:56,230
Bai Yue is dead.

790
00:42:56,710 --> 00:42:57,600
