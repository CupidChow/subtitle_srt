[Episode 9]

4
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:39,440
Miss Luo,

5
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:40,440
let me cook it for you.

6
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,000
It's okay. I can do it.

7
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:15,240
You're cooking?

8
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,880
No need to cook a lot.

9
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,190
I only need one or two of them.

10
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,750
I can't eat them up alone.

11
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:29,670
How do you know

12
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:30,800
I like eating shumai.

13
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,190
Did you ask Lian Shu about it?

14
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:36,600
No.

15
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:39,670
Take some since you like Shumai.

16
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,520
Mr. Han, you're here in time

17
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:45,240
and so lucky.

18
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,030
Hurry.

19
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,880
Shu cooked many dishes

20
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,550
to thank me.

21
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:50,910
I can't eat them up alone.

22
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:51,880
Let's share the food together.

23
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:17,830
Your Honor, please have a seat.

24
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,160
Take a seat. Don't stand on cerenomy.

25
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:25,270
Thanks for your hard work.

26
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,630
How does it taste?

27
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:54,910
Very tasty.

28
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,190
So good!

29
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,320
I can eat five plates of them.

30
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,110
Yummy.

31
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,600
That's good.

32
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,320
Try some.

33
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,790
It may be hurt.

34
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,070
Bear with it.

35
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:20,830
A small wound.

36
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:23,160
Eating some nutritious food
will get you recovered soon.

37
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,200
You're cooking?

38
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,200
You cook so much food.

39
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,600
No need.

40
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:37,110
I can't eat them up alone.

41
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:38,320
How do you know

42
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,640
I like eatting Shumai?

43
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:41,110
Did you ask Lian Shu about it?

44
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,230
She must have a crush on me.

45
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,390
Who has a crush on you?

46
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:54,550
Who else could it be?

47
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,110
Of course it's Shu.

48
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:01,880
If Chief Luo

49
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:02,830
hears what you said,

50
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:04,510
she'll think you're muddled again.

51
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:06,790
What do you know?

52
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,760
I'm sure

53
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,070
she likes me.

54
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:50,600
Great.

55
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:53,640
It's a crucial step

56
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:55,230
that gets me

57
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:56,160
out of danger.

58
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:57,550
Your Honor.

59
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:00,720
You can play chess too?

60
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,640
Shall we play a game?

61
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:09,510
Okay.

62
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:13,600
Your papers of you cutting ties
with the old identity

63
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,720
will be issued soon.

64
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:16,510
What are your plans for the future?

65
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,200
I haven't decided yet.

66
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:22,230
I'll see how it goes.

67
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:25,830
Just tell me

68
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:27,070
whatever your problem is.

69
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,670
I'll help you

70
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:30,830
as long as I'm capable to handle it.

71
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,320
Thank you.

72
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:39,760
You can call my name

73
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:41,200
when we stay alone.

74
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,390
Your Honor,

75
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:46,510
that's not appropriate.

76
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:47,880
It's alright.

77
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:50,160
I treat you as my friend.

78
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:52,670
So we're equal

79
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:53,550
in status as friends.

80
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,200
What is on your mind?

81
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:05,160
I'm lucky to have you

82
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:07,830
treat me equally.

83
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,790
But Mei Changxiong

84
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:12,640
is the unlucky one.

85
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,720
You still think about
the case of the Mei Family?

86
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,670
His neighbors think

87
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:22,270
he's a rough trader,

88
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:23,270
not a good match

89
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:24,760
for a woman from a family of scholar.

90
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,550
It serves him right.

91
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:28,760
But he only wishes

92
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,110
to improve his social status

93
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:31,640
by his own efforts.

94
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,320
Is there anything wrong with that?

95
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,230
To have a better social status,

96
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:37,480
he works hard for it.

97
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,040
Nothing is wrong with that.

98
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:41,390
But Mei Changxiong

99
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:42,600
shouldn't put status

100
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:44,600
above the real happiness.

101
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,110
And he shouldn't run

102
00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:48,110
after the less important things.

103
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,480
One cannot serve God and Mammon.

104
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:54,350
For the name and love,

105
00:07:55,230 --> 00:07:56,720
which one do you think

106
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:58,390
is more important?

107
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,040
Giving up love for name,

108
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:06,230
one's life will be hard.

109
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:08,670
Giving up name for love

110
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,350
is also not the choice for a true man.

111
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,720
What a true man should do?

112
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,510
Respect heaven and earth.

113
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,270
Serve the people.

114
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,230
Inherit the classics of the sages.

115
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:20,070
Build peace for the world.

116
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,390
What a great ambition!

117
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:25,230
Impressive.

118
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:27,480
Watch your step.

119
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:56,320
I've lost.

120
00:08:58,110 --> 00:08:59,080
You aways

121
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,960
make me suprised.

122
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:03,200
You play so well.

123
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:05,350
Must have trained this before.

124
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,000
When I was at Mingke House,

125
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:09,440
I was taught to play it.

126
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,110
If I had free time,

127
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,000
I also read chess books.

128
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,840
I've heard you're good
at playing instruments,

129
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,320
especially pipa.

130
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,150
But you never

131
00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:25,840
play it here.

132
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,790
I used to play it

133
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:32,320
to please others,

134
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,840
not for myself.

135
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:37,470
So I don't want to play it anymore.

136
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,200
Well,

137
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,880
be my audience now.

138
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,440
I'll play the flute for you.

139
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:48,030
Sit down.

140
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,200
Don't laugh at me

141
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,150
if I don't play it well.

142
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:55,910
Nail the coffin.

143
00:10:56,710 --> 00:11:00,670
Encoffin the body.

144
00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:08,230
Leave!

145
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:09,640
Stop!

146
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,280
Move aside!

147
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:12,790
Move!

148
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:15,320
You bastards!

149
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,840
Don't touch my sister's coffin!

150
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,840
It's less than three days.

151
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,760
Yet you want to bury her in a rush!

152
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,640
[Linfen Yamen]
Help me!

153
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,710
Please hold justice

154
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,760
for me!

155
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,440
Ruolan, what are you doing?

156
00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:46,230
I'm begging you.

157
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,550
Get Ruhui buried in time!

158
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,030
Well,

159
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:54,350
the villain complains first.

160
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:56,280
How scheming you are!

161
00:11:56,670 --> 00:11:58,280
What do you want, Ruolan?

162
00:11:58,470 --> 00:11:59,670
Just talk to me, okay?

163
00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:00,960
Piss off!

164
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:03,110
You villain!

165
00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:08,960
Your Honor,

166
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,640
I'm Qiao Ruolan.

167
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:12,910
Today, I'm suing He Shenwei

168
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:14,760
for murdering his wife.

169
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:16,280
You!

170
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:17,200
You!

171
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:18,590
Ridiculous!

172
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,350
I've loved your sister for years.

173
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:21,590
We didn't even have quarrels.

174
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:23,710
You're talking nonsense!

175
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:26,080
You said your sister

176
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,350
was killed by him.

177
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:28,350
Have you got evidence?

178
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:29,440
Not yet.

179
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:32,640
That's why I request the autopsy.

180
00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:33,710
No!

181
00:12:33,710 --> 00:12:34,350
Well,

182
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,030
she is dead.

183
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:37,960
It's improper to open the coffin.

184
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:38,840
Yet

185
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:40,590
you even need an autopsy.

186
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,590
Ruhui would prefer

187
00:12:42,590 --> 00:12:43,760
to rest in peace.

188
00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:45,790
How could you

189
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,710
do this to her?

190
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:48,880
Keep lying.

191
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:51,150
You didn't shed tears just now.

192
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,640
Now you get anxious?

193
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,710
If you didn't murder her,

194
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:56,150
you wouldn't fear me to do this!

195
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,520
Please open the coffin for autopsy!

196
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:01,670
Since there is a suspicion,

197
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:02,440
just do it!

198
00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:04,110
The truth can be known
after checking it.

199
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:05,150
Oh.

200
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,280
No.

201
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:10,840
Do as Mr. Qi said.

202
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:12,200
Open it!

203
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:14,350
No.

204
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:14,960
Sir,

205
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,000
stop!

206
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,790
Don't do this.

207
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:21,320
Ruhui,

208
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:24,080
I'm sorry.

209
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:26,350
Sorry for the humiliation.

210
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:29,710
I'll die with you!

211
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:34,710
Save him! Quick!

212
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:48,880
Let's do it.

213
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:02,910
What is the result?

214
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:04,880
Your Honor,

215
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:06,640
the deceased looks haggard,

216
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:07,520
with yellowing eyes.

217
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:08,440
No suspicious items

218
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,320
were found in her body.

219
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,400
She had chronic illness lying in bed

220
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:12,760
with an exhausted body

221
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,840
and died from it.

222
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:15,670
In short,

223
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:17,440
it shouldn't be a murder.

224
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:19,400
You don't think so?

225
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,400
Have you examined it carefully?

226
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:22,520
Does she have internal injuries?

227
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:23,640
Was she poisoned?

228
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:25,200
Have you all checked it thoroughly?

229
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:26,400
Thank you.

230
00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:31,280
Ruolan, I beg you.

231
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:32,520
Please!

232
00:14:33,590 --> 00:14:35,350
Let her rest in peace, okay?

233
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:36,840
Ruhui has suffered a lot

234
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,520
from the illness.

235
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:40,230
She has passed away

236
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:42,230
yet you want her body to be examined.

237
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:44,150
How could you do this?

238
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,200
What are you trying to achieve

239
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:45,910
by pushing for this?

240
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:47,110
Tell me?

241
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,840
What do I want?

242
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:50,030
He Shenwei,

243
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:52,030
She died strangely.

244
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:54,000
Think you can get what you want?

245
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:56,550
I'm still alive.

246
00:14:56,710 --> 00:14:57,960
The Qiao family's liquor workshop

247
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:58,640
will never

248
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:00,550
be handered over to you,
a matriloca guy.

249
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:03,000
Turns out he's a matrilocal one.

250
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:04,400
I didn't know this.

251
00:15:05,470 --> 00:15:07,000
Qiao Family Liquor Workshop

252
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,110
is the most famous old brand
of Linfen Town.

253
00:15:08,230 --> 00:15:09,350
The deceased is Qiao Ruhui,

254
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:10,320
the owner of the whokshop.

255
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:13,640
He Shenwei is her husband.

256
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:16,150
It's okay to be a matrilocal husband.

257
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,400
Is she here to seize the workshop?

258
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:20,400
She's dead.

259
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:22,760
My life is boring.

260
00:15:23,550 --> 00:15:25,030
I might as well die with her.

261
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:27,320
But I can't let her down.

262
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:30,470
I need to fulfill her wishes

263
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,710
to run

264
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,030
the liquor workshop well.

265
00:15:38,590 --> 00:15:39,960
This is the will Ruhui left.

266
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:42,030
Please check it, Your Honor.

267
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:54,340
[Impartial and Righteous]

268
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:00,910
I dreamed that Ruolan

269
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,440
was still at home last night.

270
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:06,030
Seeing the light without her around,

271
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:08,280
I'm speechless
and shedding tears after waking up.

272
00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:10,000
Things can change unexpectedly.

273
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:11,760
I never imagined it was my last chance

274
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,550
to see my sister on her wedding day.

275
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:15,080
My old illness has been incurable

276
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:16,590
since the miscarriage.

277
00:16:16,590 --> 00:16:18,550
Luckily, my husband attends me

278
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:20,670
day and night by my side.

279
00:16:20,910 --> 00:16:23,470
I can only wish to repay him
in the next life.

280
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:25,000
My life is short.

281
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:26,590
May we live together in the next life.

282
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:28,550
I inherited
the family business as a child.

283
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:30,520
I worked day and night,

284
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,790
but getting seriously ill.

285
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:34,640
I can't give birth to a baby

286
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,670
to enjoy the joy.

287
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:38,150
What's pity!

288
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:39,590
But then I realize

289
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:41,230
that we run the workshop

290
00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:42,670
wholeheartedly.

291
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:44,840
Isn't it like raising our child?

292
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:45,880
So in my mind

293
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:48,200
the workshop is our child.

294
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:50,960
[Will]
The dew on leeks,
so fragile, so fleeting.

295
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:52,880
It vanishes at dawn,
it will fall again in the morning.

296
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:55,520
But once gone, my wife never returns.

297
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:58,350
You lie buried beneath the springs,
your bones dissolving.

298
00:16:59,110 --> 00:17:01,030
I'm lodging in the world
with snow white hair.

299
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:04,520
Unfortunately, my life is short.

300
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,070
Please take care of yourself
and do not grieve.

301
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:08,800
I'll entrust the workshop to you.

302
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:09,880
Hope you can run it well.

303
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:13,230
Then I can rest in peace.

304
00:17:18,350 --> 00:17:19,160
Her sister's dead.

305
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,040
How could she laugh here?

306
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,070
Qiao Ruolan,

307
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:24,350
have you read the will?

308
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:25,800
Yes.

309
00:17:25,830 --> 00:17:26,640
Do you know

310
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:27,920
your sister's handwriting?

311
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:29,950
Was it written by her?

312
00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:31,000
It's her handwriting.

313
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,160
So what?

314
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:33,350
If someone

315
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:35,280
forced her to write it with a knife,

316
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,350
she had to write it

317
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:37,760
unwillingly.

318
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:39,350
Watch your words!

319
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:40,070
Your Honor,

320
00:17:40,430 --> 00:17:43,000
our workshop has been run
for five generations.

321
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:44,920
All of us worked diligently to run it.

322
00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:46,560
The martilocal guy

323
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:47,920
only married my sister for a few years.

324
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:49,000
He claimed

325
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,800
to run the workshop.

326
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,760
You're bold and ashamed!

327
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:54,310
I didn't claimed it.

328
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,040
Your sister said that.

329
00:17:56,190 --> 00:17:57,760
She and I

330
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:58,160
ran it together...

331
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:58,710
Pah!

332
00:17:58,830 --> 00:18:00,470
My parents left the workshop

333
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:01,950
to my sister and I when they passed away.

334
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:03,560
And now my sister is dead.

335
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:05,110
I'm the one to inherit it,

336
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:06,280
not you!

337
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:07,000
Qiao Ruolan,

338
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:08,830
do you have

339
00:18:09,470 --> 00:18:10,590
a will of it?

340
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:13,430
No.

341
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:14,560
But my sister and I

342
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:15,830
remember what my parents said.

343
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,040
When they passed away,

344
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:19,520
you were only five years old.

345
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,000
But I remember it.

346
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,680
You have no proof.

347
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:24,560
But your brother-in-law

348
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:25,520
has your sister's letter

349
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:26,830
as the proof.

350
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:27,310
But the letter...

351
00:18:27,310 --> 00:18:29,430
You got a dowry when you got married?

352
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:33,430
Ruhui treated her well.

353
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,280
It's a generous sum.

354
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:36,920
The dowry

355
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:40,000
is worth half
of the property of the workshop.

356
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:41,430
Qiao Ruolan,

357
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:42,950
your sister gave

358
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:44,230
the rich dowry to you.

359
00:18:44,430 --> 00:18:45,350
They're

360
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:47,400
part of the family property.

361
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,160
You have no right
to inherit the rest part.

362
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:51,880
After all, the owner

363
00:18:51,950 --> 00:18:53,000
is your sister.

364
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:00,350
Ridiculous!

365
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:02,520
Do you decide

366
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:04,040
to let him

367
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:05,310
inherit it?

368
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:06,760
He is the

369
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:08,040
only legal one to inherit it

370
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:10,070
unless you can come up
with new evidence.

371
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:11,350
But he's just a son-in-law.

372
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:12,560
According to the laws,

373
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:14,350
a son-in-law
has the right of inheritance, too.

374
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:23,350
I declare

375
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:24,830
Qiao Family Liquor Workshop

376
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,830
will be inherited by He Shenwei,

377
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:28,070
Qiao Ruhui's husband.

378
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:29,950
He Shenwei only has the right to run,

379
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:31,040
not to distribute.

380
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:33,070
He is not allowed to sell it.

381
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:34,800
Qiao Ruolan,

382
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,430
from now on

383
00:19:36,430 --> 00:19:38,280
you can't step in the operation
of the workshop.

384
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:39,560
And,

385
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:41,590
let Qiao Ruhui be buried

386
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:43,430
as soon as possible.

387
00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:45,470
Thanks, Your Honor.

388
00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:47,400
Thanks a lot!

389
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:49,830
It's not right.

390
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:52,350
This is the Qiao family's property.

391
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:53,760
Mr. He can't have it.

392
00:19:53,950 --> 00:19:56,160
Yeah, it's not right.

393
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,590
This is her family's property.

394
00:19:58,800 --> 00:19:59,520
Qiao Ruolan,

395
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:01,590
do you have any objection?

396
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:02,680
No.

397
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:04,710
He can take it.

398
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,310
But how did my sister die?

399
00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:09,190
Since you won't give me justice,

400
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,070
I'll investigate it myself,

401
00:20:11,230 --> 00:20:12,680
even if it costs me

402
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:14,280
my life.

403
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,310
Miss Luo.

404
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:01,710
Your Honor.

405
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:05,950
You still haven't gone to bed?

406
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:07,350
Take a seat.

407
00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:17,040
Are you worrying about something?

408
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:19,920
Did I declare the verdict

409
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:21,040
in hasty today?

410
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:22,400
Are you concerning
about what Qiao Ruolan said

411
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,680
before she left.

412
00:21:23,830 --> 00:21:24,470
Yes.

413
00:21:25,950 --> 00:21:27,350
She said it

414
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:28,760
unyieldingly.

415
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:30,280
It shows

416
00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:31,830
what she wants is not the workshop.

417
00:21:32,230 --> 00:21:33,950
But from the evidence so far,

418
00:21:34,430 --> 00:21:36,310
there is nothing wrong
with your judgment.

419
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,280
Her insolence

420
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:40,230
made me annoyed.

421
00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:43,310
She called him matrilocal guy,

422
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:45,560
looking down on him.

423
00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:47,520
It's annoying.

424
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,070
They don't have equal family background.

425
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:52,520
A matrilocal one is unvalued,

426
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,070
always not receiving

427
00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:55,000
the respect

428
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,040
in his wife's home.

429
00:21:56,310 --> 00:21:57,920
Then conjugal relations will be harmed.

430
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:00,470
It's good if He Shengwei

431
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:02,560
is deeply in love

432
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,040
with Qiao Ruhui.

433
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:06,800
Even if Qiao Ruolan looks down on him,

434
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,230
she still has
to fulfill her sister's wishes.

435
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:12,880
You don't think so?

436
00:22:14,230 --> 00:22:15,040
Back in the days

437
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,000
I studied with Meiqing,

438
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:18,710
we discussed a poem of Bai Juyi

439
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:19,800
for days.

440
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,000
Which one?

441
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:24,470
Who says the lives
of these birds are insignificant?

442
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:27,310
They have flesh and blood
just like humans. ‌

443
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,230
Don't hit a tree bird.

444
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:33,040
Her babies are waiting
in the nest for her return.

445
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,000
Sir,

446
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:44,880
Mr. He's been beaten again.

447
00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:45,950
Please get justice

448
00:22:45,950 --> 00:22:47,520
for him.

449
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:48,560
Don't go!

450
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:49,680
Please!

451
00:22:49,950 --> 00:22:50,920
Don't go.

452
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:52,040
I'll treat you well.

453
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:52,800
I beg you.

454
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:54,560
Please stay.

455
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:55,640
What's up?

456
00:22:56,950 --> 00:22:57,920
What are you doing?

457
00:22:58,310 --> 00:23:00,070
It has been awarded
to your brother-in-law.

458
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:00,710
Are you trying

459
00:23:00,710 --> 00:23:02,400
to defy the ruling?

460
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:03,520
I haven't taken anything

461
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:04,640
from here.

462
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,230
But you're taking

463
00:23:06,230 --> 00:23:07,560
the workers away.

464
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,070
I didn't force

465
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:10,400
them to leave.

466
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:14,190
Tell the yamen officers

467
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,710
if I forced you to leave or not.

468
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:16,680
No!

469
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:18,430
But you agreed

470
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:19,350
to double their pay

471
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:20,070
to lure them away.

472
00:23:20,070 --> 00:23:22,040
Or they wouldn't leave.

473
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:23,560
Ruolan, I beg you.

474
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:24,830
Don't do this.

475
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:26,040
You're

476
00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:27,830
not ruining my workshop,

477
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:29,560
but your sister's.

478
00:23:30,190 --> 00:23:31,110
That's

479
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,680
what she cherished.

480
00:23:33,430 --> 00:23:34,350
Please tell us more.

481
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:38,920
Sir,

482
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:41,070
we have a famous brand

483
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:43,190
called Jinrui Liquor.

484
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:46,070
It has strict requirement to make it.

485
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:47,880
The stove must be opened

486
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:48,880
on White Dew.

487
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:50,310
But it's

488
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:51,830
ten days away.

489
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:53,400
How am I supposed

490
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:54,470
to find the laborers

491
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:56,280
and teach them
to make it in a short time?

492
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:57,310
If I fail to make

493
00:23:57,310 --> 00:23:58,710
the Jinrui Liquor,

494
00:23:59,830 --> 00:24:02,160
the family's brand will be ruined.

495
00:24:02,710 --> 00:24:03,950
Ruhui's effort will

496
00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:05,950
go to waste.

497
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:09,230
If I let them

498
00:24:09,230 --> 00:24:10,310
stay here,

499
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:11,880
you can't make the liquor.

500
00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:13,430
Why?

501
00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:15,590
There is

502
00:24:15,590 --> 00:24:16,880
a recipe to make it.

503
00:24:16,950 --> 00:24:18,430
Only the member
of the Qiao family knows it,

504
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:19,830
not Mr. He.

505
00:24:22,350 --> 00:24:23,190
He Shenwei,

506
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:24,920
you claimed Ruhui left

507
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:26,880
the workshop to you.

508
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:27,470
So why didn't she

509
00:24:27,470 --> 00:24:28,800
tell you the recipe?

510
00:24:33,710 --> 00:24:34,680
Maybe she...

511
00:24:35,070 --> 00:24:35,520
Go!

512
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:36,710
Miss Qiao, we haven't done talking.

513
00:24:36,710 --> 00:24:37,560
None of your business!

514
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:38,680
Don't leave.

515
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:39,280
You're

516
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:40,110
so rude!

517
00:24:40,110 --> 00:24:40,880
Please stay.

518
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,280
I'm begging you. Don't go.

519
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:43,640
Don't go!

520
00:24:44,070 --> 00:24:44,880
You!

521
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:48,760
You shameless bitch!

522
00:24:49,830 --> 00:24:51,560
Bully the honest.

523
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:52,830
Hog the secret recipe.

524
00:24:53,310 --> 00:24:54,230
Sir,

525
00:24:54,590 --> 00:24:55,110
the magistrate

526
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:56,590
gave the verdict.

527
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,160
You have to help us.

528
00:24:58,280 --> 00:24:59,000
Don't worry.

529
00:24:59,110 --> 00:25:00,470
We'll support you.

530
00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:01,680
Right? Chief Luo.

531
00:25:03,190 --> 00:25:03,760
Right.

532
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:06,800
There is always a way out.

533
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:07,800
We still have ten days

534
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:08,760
to deal with it.

535
00:25:11,950 --> 00:25:12,800
Chief Luo.

536
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:16,710
Wait for me.

537
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,160
Where are you going?

538
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:21,350
Aren't we supposed

539
00:25:21,350 --> 00:25:22,760
to talk about how to save the workshop?

540
00:25:22,830 --> 00:25:23,760
I'll go find Miss Qiao.

541
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:25,430
Why?

542
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:27,160
She clearly defies the verdict,

543
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:28,160
and acts recklessly,

544
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29,350
trying to damage the liquor worship.

545
00:25:29,430 --> 00:25:30,000
As she can't

546
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,110
own it,

547
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:32,230
she wants to destroy it.

548
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:33,190
It's terrible.

549
00:25:33,190 --> 00:25:34,190
So I'm going to persuade her.

550
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:36,000
It's not helpful to do that.

551
00:25:36,590 --> 00:25:37,590
Your advice might help

552
00:25:37,590 --> 00:25:38,430
the reasonable people.

553
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:39,680
But she is

554
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:40,280
an unreasonable one.

555
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:41,520
No need to persuade her.

556
00:25:42,310 --> 00:25:43,230
Miss Qiao

557
00:25:43,230 --> 00:25:44,760
despises him

558
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:45,760
and always calls him

559
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:46,830
a matrilocal one.

560
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,280
Though she looks down on him,

561
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,160
he's her brother-in-law,

562
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:50,310
loving her sister for many years.

563
00:25:50,310 --> 00:25:51,430
She should respect him.

564
00:25:53,230 --> 00:25:53,590
Hey.

565
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:56,580
[Good Weather for Bumper Harvest]

566
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,280
You better not enter.

567
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:01,560
She won't tell me if you go in.

568
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,000
I might go with you

569
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:03,520
in case she...

570
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,190
No!

571
00:26:06,470 --> 00:26:06,800
Fine.

572
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:09,110
I'll walk around in the neighborhood.

573
00:26:09,310 --> 00:26:10,520
Don't worry about me.

574
00:26:12,110 --> 00:26:13,110
Be careful.

575
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:16,350
Sir,

576
00:26:16,350 --> 00:26:17,640
you should be careful later.

577
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:18,800
If this wicked woman throws a temper,

578
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:20,470
she might hit you well.

579
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:21,640
Is your Young Lady

580
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:22,350
so hot-tempered?

581
00:26:22,350 --> 00:26:23,280
Young Lady?

582
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:24,590
I never served her.

583
00:26:24,830 --> 00:26:25,830
You're new here?

584
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:26,920
I've been here for two years.

585
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:28,560
She had married when I came.

586
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:29,400
Mrs. Qiao is

587
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,640
so gentle and friendly.

588
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,230
But her sister

589
00:26:32,230 --> 00:26:33,310
is so wicked.

590
00:26:33,310 --> 00:26:34,160
She came back

591
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:35,310
to get the workshop this time.

592
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:37,110
You have to believe me.

593
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:38,470
Mrs. Qiao had been ill for so long.

594
00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:39,950
Yet she never came back to see her.

595
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,760
She's ashamed to say
she loves Mrs. Qiao,

596
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:43,710
and even dared hit Mr. He.

597
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:46,110
Did Mr. He treat his wife well?

598
00:26:46,110 --> 00:26:47,520
It's definitely very well.

599
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:48,310
When Mrs. Qiao was ill,

600
00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:49,800
Mr. He served her all the while.

601
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,070
To pray for her,

602
00:26:51,070 --> 00:26:51,920
he also donated

603
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:53,470
200 liang for merit.

604
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:56,000
He did have a heart.

605
00:26:56,230 --> 00:26:56,710
This way.

606
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:59,000
Here we are.

607
00:26:59,350 --> 00:27:00,590
Go in yourself please.

608
00:27:00,590 --> 00:27:01,590
I'm going back.

609
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:03,230
Came to bring

610
00:27:03,230 --> 00:27:04,640
food for your master.

611
00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:06,640
This is the Qiao family's residence.

612
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:08,560
I only serve Miss Qiao.

613
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,190
You're Miss Qiao's maid.

614
00:27:23,470 --> 00:27:25,470
How come you are doing the hard work?

615
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:27,000
It's okay, Ms. Wang.

616
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:29,040
I can heat up water.

617
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:30,520
It's been hard for you.

618
00:27:31,230 --> 00:27:32,230
Outrageous!

619
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:33,680
He doesn't even

620
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:34,760
arrange the servant.

621
00:27:35,470 --> 00:27:36,070
Take it.

622
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:37,350
Hurry to let Miss Qiao

623
00:27:37,590 --> 00:27:39,280
to have the meal before it gets cool.

624
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:40,640
Ms. Wang is the kindest.

625
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:41,560
I was just going out

626
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:42,760
to buy some food for Miss Qiao.

627
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:45,800
Oh, no need.

628
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:47,830
Our old servants are still here.

629
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:50,000
We'll bring Miss Qiao food.

630
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:51,470
She worries to get you implicated

631
00:27:51,470 --> 00:27:52,920
and cause you trouble.

632
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:54,920
Ms. Wang is here.

633
00:27:55,110 --> 00:27:57,230
Why not come in?

634
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:58,710
I gotta go.

635
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:00,110
Have much stuff to do.

636
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:01,590
I just wanna bring you the meal.

637
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:02,950
Eat some.

638
00:28:02,950 --> 00:28:03,920
I'm leaving.

639
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:05,160
I'll see you off. Go.

640
00:28:07,190 --> 00:28:08,560
No need.

641
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:09,920
Go have the meal.

642
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:10,950
I'm leaving.

643
00:28:11,830 --> 00:28:13,230
Bye.

644
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:27,950
Why?

645
00:28:28,310 --> 00:28:29,710
Sir,

646
00:28:29,710 --> 00:28:31,040
you wanna come into my room?

647
00:28:32,070 --> 00:28:33,000
Take a closer look.

648
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:40,760
A women constable

649
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:41,920
in yamen?

650
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:44,830
You came here.

651
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:47,000
I bet He Shenwei
gave you a lot of money.

652
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:47,920
You even came to my home

653
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:48,920
to persuade me.

654
00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:50,680
You don't run the liquor workshop,

655
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:52,230
but double the pay to take

656
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:53,280
the workers away.

657
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:54,590
What you did

658
00:28:54,590 --> 00:28:55,920
shows what you care

659
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:58,230
isn't the property

660
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:00,560
but the reason for your sister's death.

661
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,190
As soon as

662
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:09,110
I knew her death,

663
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:11,430
I was in shock.

664
00:29:13,310 --> 00:29:15,040
Hadn't she been sick for a long time?

665
00:29:15,430 --> 00:29:15,800
How come

666
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:17,350
you were not prepared mentally?

667
00:29:17,710 --> 00:29:19,950
I didn't even know she was sick

668
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,760
until I got back the family.

669
00:29:23,350 --> 00:29:25,000
She had been sick in bed for a year

670
00:29:25,710 --> 00:29:27,680
but never told me.

671
00:29:29,110 --> 00:29:30,640
Did you two keep in touch?

672
00:29:33,590 --> 00:29:35,230
We grew up together

673
00:29:35,710 --> 00:29:36,950
and had affection for each other.

674
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:39,070
After I got married,

675
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:41,040
we also kept writing letters
to each other.

676
00:29:41,190 --> 00:29:43,160
We talked about everything.

677
00:29:43,430 --> 00:29:44,160
But she didn't

678
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:45,470
tell me she was ill.

679
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:49,350
She probably

680
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,470
didn't want you to worry her.

681
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:53,640
If she got sick occasionally,

682
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:55,070
she might keep it from me.

683
00:29:55,310 --> 00:29:57,160
But she was terribly ill.

684
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,830
Even if she didn't tell me,

685
00:29:58,830 --> 00:29:59,560
shouldn't her husband

686
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:00,950
inform me in time?

687
00:30:00,950 --> 00:30:02,000
But he only

688
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:02,800
informed me her death.

689
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:06,400
A few days ago,

690
00:30:07,230 --> 00:30:08,470
I looked forward

691
00:30:08,710 --> 00:30:10,560
to hearing from my sister.

692
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:12,560
But I only received

693
00:30:13,310 --> 00:30:15,230
her death news in the end.

694
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:19,070
He Shenwei had the will,

695
00:30:19,430 --> 00:30:21,520
saying Ruhui left the workshop to him.

696
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:23,880
Asked me the recipe of Jinrui Liquor.

697
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:26,680
Our family business
has been thriving for generations

698
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:28,310
depending on this recipe.

699
00:30:28,950 --> 00:30:30,160
If Ruhui wished

700
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:31,640
to leave the workshop to him,

701
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:33,800
she would give the recipe to him.

702
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:35,590
Do you believe

703
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:37,280
what he said

704
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:38,800
and the will?

705
00:30:40,710 --> 00:30:41,640
How did he marry

706
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:42,830
your sister?

707
00:30:47,190 --> 00:30:50,040
I was young when my parents died.

708
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:53,280
My sister was still a teenager.

709
00:30:54,190 --> 00:30:56,230
But she supported the family by herself,

710
00:30:57,110 --> 00:30:58,710
raised me up,

711
00:30:59,110 --> 00:31:00,520
and ran the business.

712
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:02,000
That's why

713
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,070
she didn't get married

714
00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:04,310
in time.

715
00:31:05,110 --> 00:31:06,520
She would rather suffer herself

716
00:31:07,190 --> 00:31:08,430
for me to live better.

717
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:12,110
When I was 16,

718
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:14,190
Mr. Sun let a matchmaker

719
00:31:14,190 --> 00:31:16,070
to propose a marriage.

720
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:17,830
Ruhui knew

721
00:31:18,590 --> 00:31:20,400
I like Mr. Sun.

722
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:23,070
She accepted the propose on the spot.

723
00:31:24,310 --> 00:31:25,590
But I didn't agree.

724
00:31:26,230 --> 00:31:27,310
You didn't want her

725
00:31:27,310 --> 00:31:28,680
to stay in the family alone.

726
00:31:30,590 --> 00:31:31,590
To make me agree

727
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:33,070
to get married,

728
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:35,920
she decided to find
a matrilocal husband.

729
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:40,230
But good men rarely would want to be

730
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,470
a matrilocal husband.

731
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:44,760
After selection,

732
00:31:44,990 --> 00:31:46,520
she found He Shenwei was educated

733
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:48,320
and looked honest,

734
00:31:48,870 --> 00:31:50,440
so she chose him.

735
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:52,230
But I worried

736
00:31:52,590 --> 00:31:54,040
she wouldn't be happy.

737
00:31:55,050 --> 00:31:56,100
Give me two of them.

738
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,190
How many times has this been？

739
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:00,790
Sir,

740
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,200
this is the fifth one.

741
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:05,880
The fifth one but so terrible?

742
00:32:06,270 --> 00:32:07,240
Can you write it well or not?

743
00:32:07,310 --> 00:32:07,760
I...

744
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:08,880
If it's not okay,

745
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,000
I can write more.

746
00:32:10,910 --> 00:32:11,720
Quick!

747
00:32:11,910 --> 00:32:12,910
If you still write the lame one,

748
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:14,480
don't do business here.

749
00:32:14,790 --> 00:32:16,790
I'll write it now.

750
00:32:23,550 --> 00:32:24,080
So lame!

751
00:32:39,150 --> 00:32:41,310
The words are nice.

752
00:33:04,790 --> 00:33:06,390
I bring you the white fungus soup.

753
00:33:08,230 --> 00:33:10,190
You check up account at night again?

754
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:11,900
Take care of your eyes.

755
00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:13,230
I've reminded you many times,

756
00:33:13,230 --> 00:33:14,190
yet you still do this.

757
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:16,140
It's amost done.

758
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:21,380
Well, better make the wick lighter.

759
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:25,780
All right.

760
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:27,500
You are the kindest to me.

761
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:29,230
Come on.

762
00:33:29,710 --> 00:33:30,550
Drink the soup.

763
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:31,900
I'll do the work for you.

764
00:33:33,070 --> 00:33:33,470
Here.

765
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:41,470
What did you do today?

766
00:33:44,550 --> 00:33:45,950
I didn't go out today.

767
00:33:46,070 --> 00:33:47,470
I was at home all day.

768
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:51,310
Didn't you go watch him secretly?

769
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:56,430
Ruhui,

770
00:33:57,310 --> 00:33:59,190
will you pick him to be your husband?

771
00:34:02,350 --> 00:34:03,230
Yeah.

772
00:34:04,190 --> 00:34:06,190
It's okay if he lives the life diligently.

773
00:34:07,430 --> 00:34:09,260
He was educated.

774
00:34:09,310 --> 00:34:10,500
When he comes to our family,

775
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:12,700
he can share the burden with me.

776
00:34:14,740 --> 00:34:17,070
His body looks weaker.

777
00:34:17,670 --> 00:34:19,070
But looks like he has a good temper

778
00:34:19,310 --> 00:34:20,420
and he is honest.

779
00:34:20,870 --> 00:34:21,670
The point is,

780
00:34:22,070 --> 00:34:23,420
he won't bully you.

781
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:26,780
I'll listen to your advice.

782
00:34:27,350 --> 00:34:28,980
I trust your judgement.

783
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:30,700
Let's make up the mind.

784
00:34:33,670 --> 00:34:34,500
Drink some soup.

785
00:34:35,910 --> 00:34:37,350
Then I'll gulp it in.

786
00:34:37,350 --> 00:34:38,390
Sure.

787
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:40,150
I can open my mouth widely.

788
00:34:40,740 --> 00:34:41,670
Really?

789
00:34:42,830 --> 00:34:44,020
Be careful.

790
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:45,110
It's hot.

791
00:34:46,740 --> 00:34:48,220
If I could make the choice again,

792
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:50,350
I'd rather to make her

793
00:34:50,350 --> 00:34:51,980
find the one she loves.

794
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:54,020
I'd run the family business.

795
00:34:55,350 --> 00:34:56,740
But it's too late.

796
00:34:57,870 --> 00:34:59,110
The only thing I can do

797
00:35:00,110 --> 00:35:00,630
is to get justice

798
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:04,550
for my sister.

799
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:07,390
I'll get to the bottom of it.

800
00:35:08,310 --> 00:35:09,350
If your sister died

801
00:35:09,350 --> 00:35:10,390
for other reasons,

802
00:35:10,870 --> 00:35:11,630
the magistrate

803
00:35:11,630 --> 00:35:13,220
will get justice for her.

804
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:15,460
But if He Shenwei

805
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:16,740
is innocent,

806
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:18,670
you should let it go.

807
00:35:19,110 --> 00:35:20,550
Don't give him a hard time.

808
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:22,670
If he really is innocent,

809
00:35:23,110 --> 00:35:24,830
I'll give him the workshop

810
00:35:24,830 --> 00:35:25,910
and the recipe.

811
00:35:26,150 --> 00:35:27,780
And I will apologize to him.

812
00:35:29,350 --> 00:35:30,220
You promise.

813
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:31,830
Yes.

814
00:35:33,910 --> 00:35:34,780
How are you gonna investigate it?

815
00:35:36,390 --> 00:35:37,870
I'll talk with He Shenwei.

816
00:35:44,170 --> 00:35:44,210
[Great Scenery with Water]

817
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:54,260
His courtyard is ahead.

818
00:35:54,350 --> 00:35:55,740
I won't go.

819
00:35:55,740 --> 00:35:57,180
Please go there yourself.

820
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:16,390
What are you doing here?

821
00:36:17,310 --> 00:36:17,740
I...

822
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:19,350
I snuck in here.

823
00:36:19,350 --> 00:36:20,150
Are you Ok?

824
00:36:22,150 --> 00:36:22,940
Who's that?

825
00:36:28,390 --> 00:36:28,670
Chief Luo...

826
00:36:28,830 --> 00:36:29,910
Please sit.

827
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:30,830
You go on.

828
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:32,420
Yeah. No need to stand up.

829
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:33,350
Apply your medicine first.

830
00:36:34,110 --> 00:36:34,460
Done.

831
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:35,550
I'll come again

832
00:36:35,550 --> 00:36:36,460
to apply the medicine tomorrow.

833
00:36:37,150 --> 00:36:37,630
Thank you.

834
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:45,220
This is Dr. Hua.

835
00:36:45,550 --> 00:36:47,020
He treats the illness of my family.

836
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:50,310
Bye.

837
00:36:53,910 --> 00:36:54,830
This way please.

838
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:55,980
Okay.

839
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:02,070
Have a seat.

840
00:37:07,780 --> 00:37:08,590
Thanks.

841
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:13,670
By the way,

842
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:15,550
did she talk to you peacefully?

843
00:37:15,550 --> 00:37:16,630
Did she hit you?

844
00:37:18,630 --> 00:37:19,780
She was friendly.

845
00:37:22,150 --> 00:37:22,780
What

846
00:37:23,350 --> 00:37:24,460
did she say?

847
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:28,500
She said Ruhui had been ill
for over a year,

848
00:37:28,590 --> 00:37:30,420
but never told her.

849
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:31,420
She's suspicious of it.

850
00:37:33,910 --> 00:37:34,980
I persuaded Ruhui to tell her.

851
00:37:35,590 --> 00:37:37,260
But she refused

852
00:37:38,350 --> 00:37:39,590
as she feared

853
00:37:40,180 --> 00:37:41,310
Ruolan might get worried.

854
00:37:41,910 --> 00:37:42,780
Ruhui

855
00:37:43,110 --> 00:37:43,910
always bore the burden

856
00:37:43,910 --> 00:37:45,180
by herself.

857
00:37:46,150 --> 00:37:47,830
She loved her sister the most.

858
00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:50,630
How did Ruhui fall ill?

859
00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:53,420
She

860
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:54,630
had been ill

861
00:37:54,630 --> 00:37:55,830
since she was young

862
00:37:56,150 --> 00:37:57,630
due to the family burden to her.

863
00:37:58,260 --> 00:37:59,220
After we got married,

864
00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:00,870
she didn't get pregnant for a long time.

865
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:03,870
Doctors treated her said

866
00:38:03,870 --> 00:38:04,870
she shouldn't carry a baby

867
00:38:04,870 --> 00:38:07,420
with her body condition.

868
00:38:08,740 --> 00:38:09,460
I told her

869
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:11,350
we can live

870
00:38:11,350 --> 00:38:12,420
without a baby.

871
00:38:12,830 --> 00:38:14,220
But she was determined

872
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:15,390
to have a baby with me.

873
00:38:15,390 --> 00:38:17,630
She said a family with no children

874
00:38:17,630 --> 00:38:19,180
wasn't perfect.

875
00:38:20,180 --> 00:38:22,910
Then she finally got pregnant.

876
00:38:23,670 --> 00:38:24,910
We were very happy.

877
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:29,630
But the baby

878
00:38:31,590 --> 00:38:32,630
was miscarried.

879
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:36,180
Her body condition worsened

880
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:38,630
due to the miscarriage.

881
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:41,980
It was all my fault.

882
00:38:42,740 --> 00:38:44,310
I should have stopped her

883
00:38:44,310 --> 00:38:45,220
from carrying the baby

884
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:46,310
in the beginning.

885
00:38:46,310 --> 00:38:46,910
I should have prevented her

886
00:38:46,910 --> 00:38:48,110
from taking the risk.

887
00:38:48,110 --> 00:38:48,460
I...

888
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:49,110
Mr. He,

889
00:38:50,670 --> 00:38:52,220
she loved you so much.

890
00:38:52,220 --> 00:38:53,910
That's why
she was willing to take the risk.

891
00:38:54,350 --> 00:38:55,220
Don't blame yourself.

892
00:38:56,220 --> 00:38:56,630
Yeah.

893
00:38:56,980 --> 00:38:58,020
It's not your fault.

894
00:38:59,910 --> 00:39:00,590
But

895
00:39:01,150 --> 00:39:02,630
why didn't she tell you

896
00:39:03,020 --> 00:39:04,630
the recipe of Jinrui Liquor?

897
00:39:07,390 --> 00:39:08,940
Maybe he couldn't find a chance to tell me.

898
00:39:10,780 --> 00:39:12,310
She was serious ill

899
00:39:13,110 --> 00:39:14,420
before she died.

900
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:15,910
She was confused

901
00:39:15,910 --> 00:39:17,420
and could barely speak.

902
00:39:19,150 --> 00:39:20,550
How did she leave the will?

903
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:24,070
Will?

904
00:39:24,910 --> 00:39:25,940
After she died,

905
00:39:26,830 --> 00:39:28,420
I found the will

906
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:29,780
when I sorted her belongings.

907
00:39:31,110 --> 00:39:31,780
What a liar

908
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:33,220
you are!

909
00:39:33,220 --> 00:39:33,870
If she could

910
00:39:33,870 --> 00:39:35,260
write the will,

911
00:39:35,260 --> 00:39:36,550
she could have written the recipe!

912
00:39:36,550 --> 00:39:37,070
You termagant!

913
00:39:37,070 --> 00:39:38,180
You were even eavesdropping outside.

914
00:39:38,180 --> 00:39:39,350
Wanna hit him again?

915
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:41,760
You are lying. Just go on!

916
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:43,870
We yamen officers must stop you

917
00:39:43,870 --> 00:39:45,150
from doing it today!

918
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:48,400
You Yamen officers

919
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:49,990
hold the justice like that?

920
00:39:49,990 --> 00:39:50,600
Yes.

921
00:39:50,790 --> 00:39:51,840
We protect the weak,

922
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:52,640
not a wicked woman like you.

923
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:53,430
Shut up!

924
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:57,990
Hands off!

925
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:02,270
You still don't believe me.

926
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:03,750
Your colleague blames me.

927
00:40:03,790 --> 00:40:04,990
How am I supposed to trust you?

928
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:06,560
Mr. Qi isn't a yamen officer,

929
00:40:06,750 --> 00:40:08,080
but the magistrate's friend.

930
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:09,680
He keens on handing cases.

931
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:10,710
So he came with me today.

932
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:13,030
What he said doesn't represent
the stand of yamen.

933
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:14,790
Don't take it seriously.

934
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:19,120
You told me that you and your sister

935
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:20,120
wrote letters to each other frequently.

936
00:40:20,750 --> 00:40:22,270
May I see those letters?

937
00:40:23,190 --> 00:40:24,360
I just want to check them

938
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:25,950
as I have some questions.

939
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:29,190
What questions?

940
00:40:30,190 --> 00:40:30,990
They're about

941
00:40:31,030 --> 00:40:32,710
when she miscarried

942
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:34,790
and how her health condition was
after it?

943
00:40:35,270 --> 00:40:35,990
Besides,

944
00:40:35,990 --> 00:40:37,160
her body was so weak.

945
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:38,470
Why did she insist on having a baby?

946
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:41,430
Well, it's not

947
00:40:41,430 --> 00:40:42,320
what He Shenwei said,

948
00:40:42,790 --> 00:40:43,840
and not for him.

949
00:40:44,190 --> 00:40:46,030
She wanted a baby

950
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:46,790
because she felt

951
00:40:46,790 --> 00:40:48,640
a baby was her only hope.

952
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:51,790
It was hard for her getting pregnant.

953
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:53,640
And then how did she conceive it later?

954
00:40:54,990 --> 00:40:56,880
She got a prescription.

955
00:40:57,560 --> 00:40:58,510
Who gave it to her?

956
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:00,510
The doctor came here just now.

957
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:01,560
He is Hua Miao.

958
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:03,080
He came to treat her

959
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:04,990
after I got married.

960
00:41:05,030 --> 00:41:06,430
In Ruhui's letters to me,

961
00:41:06,470 --> 00:41:07,680
his name was mentioned many times.

962
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,510
She was very grateful to him

963
00:41:09,790 --> 00:41:11,190
as he made the prescription for her.

964
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:12,840
These are all clues.

965
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:14,680
So

966
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:16,270
may I see those letters?

967
00:41:21,710 --> 00:41:23,600
I'll sent someone
back to my house to get them.

968
00:41:24,510 --> 00:41:25,270
You mean

969
00:41:25,270 --> 00:41:26,600
no progress has been made,

970
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:28,320
but you've got some clues.

971
00:41:28,950 --> 00:41:29,750
Yes.

972
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:31,840
Qiao Ruolan will get the letters for me.

973
00:41:32,230 --> 00:41:33,360
I'm gonna visit

974
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:34,120
Dr. Hua tomorrow.

975
00:41:39,270 --> 00:41:40,360
Can I help you?

976
00:41:41,190 --> 00:41:42,880
You wanna go with me as an adviser?

977
00:41:43,430 --> 00:41:44,510
Yes, why not?

978
00:41:44,990 --> 00:41:45,920
At the worst

979
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:46,710
Mr. Chen will nag me for this

980
00:41:46,710 --> 00:41:48,030
for a while after I return.

981
00:41:49,270 --> 00:41:50,920
No need. I can handle it.

982
00:41:51,030 --> 00:41:51,880
What matters is not making him

983
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:53,600
nag you again.

984
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:55,950
Then you must be careful.

985
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:57,560
Just investigate it.

986
00:41:57,750 --> 00:41:59,120
and tell me

987
00:41:59,120 --> 00:41:59,840
if you need me to lend you a hand.

988
00:42:11,710 --> 00:42:13,080
Are you in a rush?

989
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:20,270
It's not convenient to go out.

990
00:42:20,270 --> 00:42:21,510
Just stay inside, okay?

991
00:42:21,510 --> 00:42:22,320
No.

992
00:42:33,790 --> 00:42:35,470
We need the money to do many things.

993
00:42:35,470 --> 00:42:36,230
Today you will...

994
00:42:38,270 --> 00:42:39,080
Excuse me.

995
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:40,710
Excuse me.

996
00:42:41,470 --> 00:42:42,080
Go back.

997
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:43,120
Don't worry about the money.

998
00:42:44,430 --> 00:42:45,560
I'll give you two more days.

999
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:46,990
Don't you ever lie to me again.

1000
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:47,790
