[Under the Moonlight]

00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,700
[Adapted from the novel "Jin Nang" by Shui He]

3
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:33,020
[Episode 13]

4
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,080
She has left.

5
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:47,720
So stop dwelling on it.

6
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,360
The deeper you sink in,
the more it will hurt.

7
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,230
She already knows about the engagement

8
00:01:58,870 --> 00:01:59,870
between Liu Wan and me.

9
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:03,440
What's meant to happen will happen.

10
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:05,950
It's better to end it now.

11
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,120
You and her

12
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:09,190
are from completely different worlds.

13
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:12,800
But I have feelings...

14
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:14,360
I know you like her,

15
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:16,000
but what does that change?

16
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,880
Are you going to ask Mr. Liu

17
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,190
to cancel the engagement?

18
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:23,520
Muzhi,

19
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,720
you are meant for greater things.

20
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:27,030
How can you let personal feelings

21
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:28,440
ruin your career?

22
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,470
What is Luo Shu's status?

23
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:32,080
And what is yours?

24
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:33,440
You can accept her,

25
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:34,630
but will Liu Wan and Mr. Liu

26
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,030
tolerate her?

27
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,520
In your eyes,

28
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:39,800
if a man's future is hindered,

29
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:40,830
it's not because he's useless,

30
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:42,440
but rather because a woman
has held him back.

31
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,800
You're talking about doing great things,

32
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:45,720
but he can't even protect

33
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:46,160
the woman he likes.

34
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,190
What great things can he achieve?

35
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:48,360
To me,

36
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,270
he's just a heartless,

37
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:50,270
hypocritical man.

38
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:52,910
What kind of man

39
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:54,160
can stand tall

40
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:55,240
when he doesn't even count as a man?

41
00:02:58,670 --> 00:02:59,550
Don't blame it

42
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:00,520
on women.

43
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:11,080
This is a document from Pingyangwei

44
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,440
about assisting you
to eliminate bandits.

45
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,160
Remember to sign it.

46
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:24,880
What did I say wrong?

47
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,550
Why was he scolding me?

48
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:29,800
He was scolding me.

49
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:33,030
How can he say that about Luo Shu?

50
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,320
Talking bad about women
behind their backs,

51
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,240
what kind of man is that?

52
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,390
So you're angry

53
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:39,800
for Chief Luo?

54
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,080
I just can't stand it

55
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:41,630
when people slander her.

56
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:42,910
I get angry
when I hear someone speak ill of her.

57
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:43,550
So you really care

58
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:44,750
about Chief Luo.

59
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:48,240
What do you know?

60
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:50,000
One must have a sense of justice, okay?

61
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,630
You're right.

62
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,390
Why does Mr. Chen

63
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:56,910
not want to go home?

64
00:03:58,750 --> 00:03:59,880
I'm talking to you!

65
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,160
Are you stupid?

66
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:01,880
If he goes home,

67
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:03,190
it's like a sheep
entering a tiger's den.

68
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:04,190
Think about it.

69
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:06,320
Mr. Chen

70
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:07,440
spends all year at the office,

71
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:08,800
claiming to be busy with work,

72
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:09,360
but actually,

73
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,720
he's avoiding his fiancée.

74
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,550
So what do you think

75
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:15,030
she looks like?

76
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:16,390
Didn't I tell you?

77
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,230
She looks just like Chen Senior.

78
00:04:19,270 --> 00:04:20,880
No, that's not right.

79
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,760
You can't say that
just because she's not good-looking,

80
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:24,320
you should just break off the engagement

81
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,480
after so many years.

82
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:28,550
They say you should marry wisely,

83
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,440
and take a concubine for looks.

84
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,200
So,

85
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:32,000
when marrying,

86
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,160
looks are secondary.

87
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,200
What's important?

88
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:38,230
What's important is matching families

89
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,670
and shared interests.

90
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:40,950
Just think,

91
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:42,760
what status does Mr. Chen have?

92
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:43,790
What knowledge does he possess?

93
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,440
For him to take notice,

94
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:46,640
not just any lady will do.

95
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:48,200
She should be a refined woman,

96
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,110
not just any

97
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:50,160
shepherd girl.

98
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:50,640
Wait a minute.

99
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:51,270
So you...

100
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:52,270
Mr. Qi.

101
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:54,200
What's wrong with a shepherd girl?

102
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:55,550
What's wrong with a shepherd girl?

103
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:56,270
Since you're engaged,

104
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:57,550
you can't let her down.

105
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:58,880
Have you eaten?

106
00:04:58,880 --> 00:04:59,320
What?

107
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:00,110
All you do is eating all day.

108
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:00,830
Shut up.

109
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:01,480
That Chen Meiqing

110
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,440
is no good.

111
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,920
Not only does he encourage others
to step on the weak,

112
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,110
but he also practices what he preaches.

113
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,110
Mr. Qi,

114
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,720
what did Mr. Chen do to offend you?

115
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:18,510
You all

116
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:20,760
want to know

117
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:22,200
what Zao Hua looks like?

118
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:24,880
Yes.

119
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:25,640
Just wait.

120
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:27,350
I'll bring her over.

121
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31,640
I'll bring Zao Hua over,

122
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:32,550
and see how Chen Meiqing

123
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:33,510
will handle this.

124
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:35,830
What are you worried about?

125
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:37,790
I will

126
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:38,720
tear your face apart

127
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:40,920
to vent my anger
for Luo Shu and Zao Hua.

128
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,350
Young Master,

129
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,110
you don't know Zao Hua.

130
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:45,670
But I know Chen Meiqing.

131
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,480
I must let Zao Hua

132
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:49,200
see Chen Meiqing's true colors

133
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:50,440
and not fall for his tricks.

134
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,510
Young Master.

135
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:52,880
What?

136
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,640
We aren't staying here anymore?

137
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:02,220
[Linfen Yamen]

138
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:08,140
[Linfen Yamen]

139
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,270
Qian Dayou,
the mine owner of Mantian Ridge,

140
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:21,070
is in league with the White Ants.

141
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:22,950
Where's the messenger?

142
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:24,320
I haven't seen him.

143
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:26,040
You can leave.

144
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,040
What do you think?

145
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:33,270
This letter has no signature,

146
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:34,760
and the evidence inside is insufficient.

147
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:35,760
It's hard to tell if it's true or false.

148
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:36,640
I think

149
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:38,790
it's likely to be true.

150
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,270
Do you know Qian Dayou?

151
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:46,830
Qian Dayou is a local tyrant.

152
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,760
He has been mining
in Mantian Ridge for years.

153
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,830
Behind him is Eunuch Zhang,
the mine supervisor.

154
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,510
Previously,
the imperial court issued an edict,

155
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:53,600
saying that mining taxes

156
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,000
should be paid to the local government.

157
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:55,950
The former magistrate

158
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:57,640
sent someone to negotiate with him,

159
00:06:57,830 --> 00:06:58,720
but he actually told the magistrate

160
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,480
to go find Eunuch Zhang for money.

161
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:01,880
That's outrageous.

162
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,440
The mine supervision and taxation
are indeed harsh policies.

163
00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:05,350
Be cautious.

164
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,110
Those eunuchs

165
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:07,440
are appointed by the Emperor.

166
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,350
It's a fact
that they extort and oppress,

167
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:09,880
plundering the people's wealth.

168
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:10,600
Muzhi.

169
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,720
The current situation is unclear.

170
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,070
I believe it's unwise to act rashly.

171
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:20,070
Instead,
we should conceal our identities

172
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:21,550
and investigate the mine.

173
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:28,550
Who are you?

174
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:35,830
Who are you?

175
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,230
Stop! Don't come any closer!

176
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,110
Hurry up! Get out of here!

177
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,270
Hello,

178
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:44,320
we are merchants from out of town.

179
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:45,480
We come here

180
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,830
to buy some coal.

181
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,550
Please inform the owner.

182
00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:50,000
Just wait.

183
00:07:51,790 --> 00:07:52,600
Keep an eye out.

184
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,550
Who wants to buy coal?

185
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,160
May I ask who you are?

186
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:17,830
This is our mine owner.

187
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:20,160
I'm Qian Dayou.

188
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:22,920
Mr. Qian, it's a pleasure to meet you.

189
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
What is your name?

190
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:29,350
Where are you from?

191
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,760
I'm Chen from Yangcheng,

192
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,280
in the iron smelting business.

193
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,840
I need a large amount of coal.

194
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:40,110
From Yangcheng?

195
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:42,000
What brings you to Linfen

196
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,080
to buy coal?

197
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:45,200
Mr. Qian, you may not know,

198
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,400
but there's a demand
for 100,000 iron materials

199
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:49,030
to produce weapons
for various places in Shaanxi.

200
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:51,030
I have taken on some orders,

201
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:52,910
but the coal supply in Yangcheng

202
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:55,230
is limited.

203
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:57,710
I heard that the coal from Linfen

204
00:08:57,710 --> 00:08:59,590
is good quality and reasonably priced,

205
00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:01,200
so I came to check it out.

206
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,110
You've come to the right place.

207
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,440
In this area,

208
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:10,710
my coal

209
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:12,110
is the best quality.

210
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,200
That's great to hear.

211
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:16,590
But I need a large quantity,

212
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:19,110
and your mine might be too small.

213
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:22,000
We can provide as much as you need.

214
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:25,350
I wonder if you could let us

215
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:27,200
visit your mine.

216
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,470
It would help

217
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,320
to see it in person.

218
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:38,000
Of course.

219
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:39,880
Please.

220
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:40,790
After you.

221
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,840
This should be Mantian Ridge.

222
00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:55,840
Young Master,

223
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,880
where are we supposed to find Zao Hua?

224
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:00,150
Listen.

225
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Someone is singing.

226
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:14,910
Look, it's lively here.

227
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:15,760
Indeed.

228
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,550
Over there, hurry!

229
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,230
Quickly!

230
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,200
And over there too.

231
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:35,350
Take a look.

232
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:42,280
I'm longing for a kiss.

233
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:45,960
My wrist feels so soft, yah hoo hey!

234
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,710
Picking up a pair of chopsticks,

235
00:10:49,710 --> 00:10:54,080
I can't even hold a bowl, yah er yo!

236
00:10:56,110 --> 00:10:56,910
Lian Shu,

237
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,110
wait here.

238
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:03,520
Zao Hua.

239
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,550
Erniu is quite handsome.

240
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:06,590
Don't you like him?

241
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:07,470
Just him?

242
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,840
Better give up on that idea.

243
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,470
You all

244
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:15,840
aren't even worth

245
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:16,590
his toes.

246
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,470
Dare to dream here?

247
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:19,320
Hurry and get lost!

248
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:20,670
Get away from me!

249
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:21,710
Zao Hua.

250
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:24,230
Where did this scoundrel come from?

251
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:24,710
Go away!

252
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:26,110
No, it's a misunderstanding.

253
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:27,760
I'm a friend of Chen Meiqing.

254
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:29,440
Chen Meiqing?

255
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,350
You know Chen Meiqing?

256
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:32,080
Yes.

257
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,400
We see each other often.

258
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,000
So, what brings you here?

259
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:36,840
I'm here to tell you

260
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:38,400
Chen Meiqing

261
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:39,550
isn't a good man.

262
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:40,910
He's not suitable for you at all.

263
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:41,640
He doesn't deserve you.

264
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:42,670
You two should break up soon.

265
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,790
How dare you talk such nonsense here?

266
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:45,840
I'll hit you.

267
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:46,320
No...

268
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:46,880
You, come here!

269
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:48,400
Let me explain to you.

270
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,440
I'm speaking for your good.

271
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:50,710
I mean well.

272
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:52,230
I'm worried you'll be bullied.

273
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,400
You're such a nice girl.

274
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:53,960
Look

275
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:54,910
how he treats you.

276
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:56,520
What time is it?

277
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:57,550
Why hasn't the food arrived yet?

278
00:11:57,710 --> 00:11:58,320
Food

279
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,550
is getting later and later.

280
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:02,200
What's Wang Mao up to?

281
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,150
What's wrong with him?

282
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:04,840
Food's here!

283
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:06,150
Food's here!

284
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:08,230
Come on.

285
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:10,760
Hurry.

286
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:12,910
Wang Mao,

287
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:14,320
you're getting later every day.

288
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,520
We're starving here.

289
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,230
I'm the only one in the kitchen.

290
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:18,280
I can't keep up.

291
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:19,030
Excuse me, move aside.

292
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:20,080
Let me through.

293
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:23,520
You all act like starving ghosts.

294
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:25,230
You don't even know how to behave.

295
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:27,150
If you need help, hire someone.

296
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,550
It's been so long already.

297
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:29,640
I'm looking.

298
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:30,590
I need to find someone

299
00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:31,790
who's honest and hardworking.

300
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:32,790
If I hire someone

301
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:33,520
with sticky fingers,

302
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:34,520
I'll have to kick them out.

303
00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:36,670
Just make it quick.

304
00:12:36,710 --> 00:12:37,320
Here.

305
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,110
Come on.

306
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:39,910
Come on.

307
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:41,230
No shoving.

308
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:42,030
Don't rush.

309
00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:42,710
Mr. Chen,

310
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:44,910
you've seen the mine.

311
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,590
Are you satisfied?

312
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:50,710
They say
this place is rich and prosperous.

313
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:53,320
Is this coal mining?

314
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:55,670
It's like digging for silver.

315
00:12:57,150 --> 00:12:58,030
You flatter me.

316
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:01,880
I've heard
there are robbers rampant around here.

317
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:03,230
No wonder.

318
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:04,840
A single robbery here

319
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,320
would yield everything.

320
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:09,840
And what about those White Ants?

321
00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:10,880
They're the fiercest.

322
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:11,760
Mr. Chen.

323
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:14,790
You've seen the mine.

324
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:16,640
You can rest assured now.

325
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:19,280
Shall we go inside and discuss the deal?

326
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,440
I haven't even seen the pit.

327
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:22,790
Just buy the coal.

328
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:24,000
What do you need to see the pit for?

329
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:26,280
Whether the coal is good or not,

330
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,670
you can't fake it in the pit.

331
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:28,470
I need to see it.

332
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:29,200
Mr. Chen.

333
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,320
I can see you're not

334
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:35,520
really wanting to do business.

335
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:38,710
I won't do your business anymore.

336
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:41,670
Show him out!

337
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:43,350
Mr. Qian.

338
00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:45,880
Let's go.

339
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:48,880
Let's go.

340
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:55,280
Chen Meiqing!

341
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:56,470
Where's Chen Meiqing?

342
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:57,470
Tell him to come out.

343
00:13:57,550 --> 00:13:59,790
Chen Meiqing, come out!

344
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,200
Let my young master go.

345
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,320
I'll trade places with him, alright?

346
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,150
You come out.

347
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:04,840
Easy! It hurts.

348
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:05,400
Chen Meiqing!

349
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:07,030
Get out here!

350
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:07,840
Easy! It hurts.

351
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:08,080
Lady.

352
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:08,590
Chen Meiqing.

353
00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:09,440
Who is that?

354
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,670
Do you know where Chen Meiqing is?

355
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:11,960
Young Master.

356
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:13,470
Mr. Xu!

357
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:15,320
Captain Cai, Cai Baozi!

358
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,470
I brought her over for you.

359
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:17,000
Come on.

360
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:19,110
Where is Chen Meiqing?

361
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:21,150
Do you know where Chen Meiqing is?

362
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:22,200
Who?

363
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:22,710
Chen Meiqing!

364
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:23,520
Chen Meiqing!

365
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:24,590
Come out here

366
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:25,470
and talk to me.

367
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:26,550
Come out and talk to her.

368
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:28,760
Chen Meiqing. Where is he?

369
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:29,760
Tell him to come out.

370
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:30,470
Chen Meiqing!

371
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:32,030
Come out!

372
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:33,280
You got someone here to mediate.

373
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,350
What do you mean by that?

374
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:35,030
Come out!

375
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:35,880
Just let go...

376
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:36,590
Zao Hua!

377
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:37,350
Mr. Chen.

378
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:39,280
What are you doing?

379
00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:40,520
This is the yamen.

380
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:41,640
Chen Meiqing,

381
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:43,910
how did you end up like this?

382
00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:47,110
You finally came out to see me.

383
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:48,550
Zao Hua,

384
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:49,880
whatever the matter is, let's go back...

385
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:50,670
Go back where?

386
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:51,840
Right here!

387
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:53,440
Let your colleagues

388
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,440
judge this matter too.

389
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:56,470
You can't just
back out of the engagement

390
00:14:56,470 --> 00:14:58,030
that was arranged since childhood!

391
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:58,790
My lady!

392
00:14:58,790 --> 00:14:59,960
Don't embarrass me here,

393
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:00,640
alright?

394
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:02,880
Chen Meiqing,

395
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:05,000
you're looking down on me now,

396
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:05,710
right?

397
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,520
You were so good when we were kids.

398
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,280
Why have you changed

399
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:11,110
into this?

400
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,110
I treated you well when we were kids

401
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:13,760
because I saw you as my sister.

402
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,400
But now you want to marry me.

403
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:16,030
That's...

404
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,470
That's not happening.
You might as well give up.

405
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,710
You never intended to marry me.

406
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:25,760
Right?

407
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:31,150
Move aside!

408
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:33,350
Mr. Chen,

409
00:15:33,790 --> 00:15:35,200
Zao Hua is so beautiful.

410
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,030
You wouldn't marry her
even looking like this?

411
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:38,030
You really want to marry a fairy?

412
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:38,880
That's right!

413
00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:46,150
You know what?

414
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:47,640
She was saved by my father.

415
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:49,470
A woman who was about to give birth

416
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:50,590
fainted at my doorstep.

417
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,350
My father spent half a sheep

418
00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:53,470
to hire a midwife.

419
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:54,320
But this woman

420
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,590
passed away

421
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:56,760
after giving birth to a girl.

422
00:15:57,110 --> 00:15:58,640
My father felt bad
about that half a sheep.

423
00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:00,350
Blinded by grief,

424
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,590
he decided to raise her

425
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:02,840
so she can be my wife.

426
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,670
How wonderful childhood sweethearts are!

427
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:05,400
Exactly.

428
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:06,910
So many people want to marry
their childhood sweetheart,

429
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:07,590
but they can't manage it.

430
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:09,030
I raised her on goat's milk.

431
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:10,520
Closer than a real sister.

432
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:11,640
To me,

433
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:14,030
marrying her would be incest.

434
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:15,400
You're just making excuses.

435
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:17,150
Find a more reasonable one, will you?

436
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:18,230
A gentleman thinks with purity.

437
00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:19,910
A scholar must focus on his studies.

438
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:21,150
Even scholars say,

439
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:23,030
there are three unfilial acts,
of which having no heirs is the worst.

440
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:24,590
I will naturally marry.

441
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:26,080
But I absolutely cannot marry a woman

442
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,670
who disturbs my peace of mind.

443
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:28,670
If your mind isn't calm,

444
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:30,000
you can't blame others.

445
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:32,440
In short,

446
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:33,230
I can never be with Zao Hua.

447
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:34,550
If any of you are interested,

448
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:35,880
feel free to come and propose.

449
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:39,440
I'll supplement the bride price.

450
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:43,960
It seems Qian Dayou is

451
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:46,520
the chief accomplice of the White Ants.

452
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:48,400
Those missing women

453
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:50,710
must be hidden in the mine.

454
00:16:51,030 --> 00:16:52,400
There's one thing I find puzzling.

455
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:54,640
Qian Dayou owns the mine.

456
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:55,910
Why would he get involved
with the White Ants

457
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:57,910
in human trafficking?

458
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:00,590
Could it be to make more money?

459
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,280
Human trafficking is a lot of trouble

460
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:04,760
compared to mining.

461
00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:06,110
Could it be

462
00:17:06,110 --> 00:17:07,310
that the White Ants are forcing him?

463
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,680
Let's not think too much about it.

464
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:10,470
We need to rescue those girls first.

465
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:11,950
Exactly.

466
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:14,880
And since this mine

467
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,430
is under Eunuch Zhang's control,

468
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:17,520
if we really

469
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:18,590
find something,

470
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,160
it might be a breakthrough.

471
00:17:20,190 --> 00:17:20,520
Muzhi,

472
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:22,280
you mustn't act rashly.

473
00:17:22,590 --> 00:17:23,560
The mining authorities are powerful.

474
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:24,590
You can't take them on alone.

475
00:17:24,590 --> 00:17:26,110
I cannot do it alone.

476
00:17:26,110 --> 00:17:27,160
Then leave it to those

477
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,760
in high positions to handle.

478
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:29,830
You're just a magistrate.

479
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:30,640
Stay out of it.

480
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,520
Why are you always

481
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:36,430
backing down?

482
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:37,520
It's fine

483
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:38,070
if you want to be a coward.

484
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:39,310
But why stop others from trying?

485
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:44,000
Since ten years ago

486
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,680
when the Emperor sent the tax collectors

487
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:46,640
to various places,

488
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:47,680
those eunuchs

489
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:49,400
have taken advantage of the situation,
exploiting and oppressing.

490
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:51,310
They have incited public outrage.

491
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:53,680
They should have been removed long ago.

492
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,830
Mr. Liu has also sent me news,

493
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:58,160
saying there will be
movement from the court.

494
00:17:58,350 --> 00:17:59,830
How can I just sit and watch?

495
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:02,520
What are your thoughts?

496
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:03,430
Two options.

497
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:06,070
First, I can report this matter.

498
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:07,710
Wait for Mr. Liu's decision,

499
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,400
cooperate with him and act accordingly.

500
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:10,350
Second,

501
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:11,640
take the initiative, gather evidence,

502
00:18:12,310 --> 00:18:13,000
and see if we can

503
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,640
use Qian Dayou

504
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,350
to bring down Eunuch Zhang.

505
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:17,400
That could open the situation.

506
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:18,400
First option.

507
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:20,640
Let's go with the first option.

508
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:31,230
Indeed, the first option is better.

509
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:35,860
[Linfen Yamen]

510
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:45,310
You finally arrived.

511
00:18:45,310 --> 00:18:46,710
Something has happened.

512
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:47,880
Father, what is it?

513
00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:49,800
Zao Hua is missing.

514
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,110
She went out
to tend the sheep yesterday,

515
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:53,640
and the sheep returned at night.

516
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:55,000
But she didn't come back.

517
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:57,680
She must be sulking at me,

518
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:58,710
pretending to run away from home.

519
00:18:58,710 --> 00:18:59,800
That's impossible!

520
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:01,590
Doumiao, tell him.

521
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:02,640
I... I'm scared.

522
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:04,230
Don't be afraid.

523
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:05,070
We're in the yamen now.

524
00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:05,880
Just tell him.

525
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:06,710
I...

526
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,070
I'm the one
tending sheep at Qian Dayou's mine.

527
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:10,560
Today at the mine,

528
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:11,710
I found this.

529
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:16,560
This is Zao Hua's.

530
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:20,000
Zao Hua...

531
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,310
Something happened to Zao Hua.

532
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:23,520
The report and Zao Hua's disappearance

533
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,920
point directly to the mine.

534
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:27,000
It seems like someone
is manipulating this from behind.

535
00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:28,310
It's too coincidental.

536
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,310
Looks like someone is eager

537
00:19:30,310 --> 00:19:31,560
to get us to investigate.

538
00:19:36,430 --> 00:19:37,350
Rescuing her is the priority.

539
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:38,350
Now we can only

540
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:39,560
choose the second option.

541
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:40,950
Meiqing.

542
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:42,880
Meiqing!

543
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:47,590
Take more people

544
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,710
to search for Zao Hua
at the mine in Mantian Ridge.

545
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:51,280
No!

546
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:52,950
These matters are interconnected.

547
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:54,230
It seems like someone is guiding us.

548
00:19:54,310 --> 00:19:55,830
Taking people there,
I don't mind if I get caught.

549
00:19:55,950 --> 00:19:56,760
What if it's a trap

550
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:57,760
set for you?

551
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,470
What if it's a trap?

552
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:00,950
As long as we can use this opportunity

553
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:01,560
to rescue Zao Hua,

554
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:02,430
to save those girls,

555
00:20:02,430 --> 00:20:03,830
and gather evidence
against Eunuch Zhang,

556
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:05,430
that would be a huge benefit.

557
00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:07,520
I can't
let my family matters affect this.

558
00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:09,160
It's not just for you.

559
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:11,230
The one who strikes first wins.

560
00:20:11,230 --> 00:20:12,760
The one who reacts is at a disadvantage.

561
00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:15,160
This time, trust me.

562
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:17,430
Your Honor,

563
00:20:18,190 --> 00:20:19,560
Qian Dayou is vigilant.

564
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:21,070
Once he discovers
the officials arriving,

565
00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:22,160
he will surely flee quickly

566
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:23,190
or hide evidence.

567
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:24,680
It's better for me to take the lead.

568
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:25,680
I'll go undercover in the mine,

569
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,160
while Mr. Chen works openly.

570
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,160
We can coordinate.

571
00:20:28,190 --> 00:20:29,640
It might yield better results.

572
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:31,000
No way, that's too dangerous.

573
00:20:32,350 --> 00:20:33,680
You've already been there once.

574
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:34,640
What if you get discovered?

575
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:35,760
The consequences would be unimaginable.

576
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,190
The other day,
I was at the end of the line.

577
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:38,680
Qian Dayou and his men

578
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:39,680
didn't even look at me.

579
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,590
This time,
I'll disguise myself as a woman,

580
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:42,880
pretending to be a refugee.

581
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:43,950
They won't discover me.

582
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:44,880
That's even worse.

583
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:46,920
You're a woman going alone.

584
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:48,190
Isn't that like a lamb
walking into a tiger's den?

585
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:54,160
I'll go with her.

586
00:20:55,190 --> 00:20:56,000
I've handled cases with Luo Shu

587
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,190
more than once or twice.

588
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,640
Our teamwork

589
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:00,160
is unmatched.

590
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:01,110
Mr. Qi,

591
00:21:01,350 --> 00:21:02,350
this is not a game.

592
00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:03,590
I'm now the commandant.

593
00:21:04,710 --> 00:21:06,350
With this identity as my protection,

594
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:07,710
if something goes wrong,

595
00:21:07,710 --> 00:21:08,430
I can reveal my identity.

596
00:21:08,430 --> 00:21:09,160
Who would dare touch me?

597
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,880
If the bandits really get ruthless,

598
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:11,680
who cares

599
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:12,800
what your identity is?

600
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:13,710
Do you have

601
00:21:13,710 --> 00:21:14,640
any other ideas?

602
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:24,640
Mr. Qi.

603
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:27,880
Magistrate Han,

604
00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:29,000
take a look.

605
00:21:29,310 --> 00:21:30,590
How do I look in this outfit?

606
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,070
Mr. Qi,

607
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:34,920
it is dangerous.

608
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:35,920
I hope

609
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,190
you'll take good care of Luo Shu.

610
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:43,950
Magistrate Han,

611
00:21:43,950 --> 00:21:45,230
if you truly cares for her,

612
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:47,470
you should
go through fire and water with her.

613
00:21:47,950 --> 00:21:50,400
Don't think you can just sit
comfortably in your high seat.

614
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:53,590
See you.

615
00:22:01,430 --> 00:22:02,160
Mr. Xu.

616
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:07,520
Wait a minute.

617
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:11,310
You're Luo Shu?

618
00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:15,000
You look so ugly.

619
00:22:15,950 --> 00:22:16,710
How's that?

620
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:17,590
Come here.

621
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:20,800
Look at your delicate skin.

622
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,310
You don't look like a refugee at all.

623
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,000
Put some more on your neck.

624
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:32,640
Hurry up!

625
00:22:33,190 --> 00:22:34,230
Okay...

626
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:38,560
Put on some more.

627
00:22:39,230 --> 00:22:39,920
Okay.

628
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,350
This is about right.

629
00:22:42,430 --> 00:22:43,430
I think you need

630
00:22:43,430 --> 00:22:44,190
a little something too.

631
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:45,310
What's that?

632
00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:51,230
What is it?

633
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:53,350
This mole

634
00:22:53,350 --> 00:22:54,560
looks quite realistic.

635
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:56,280
But what if it falls off
and gives us away?

636
00:22:56,350 --> 00:22:57,040
Don't stick it on.

637
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:05,920
Don't stick it on.

638
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,470
Why hasn't the cook arrived yet?

639
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:21,310
Don't worry.

640
00:23:21,950 --> 00:23:22,880
This is his only way

641
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:23,880
back to the mine.

642
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:25,520
Then we'll

643
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:26,760
call each other siblings.

644
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,680
I'll pretend
to faint from hunger and roll down.

645
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:29,880
You just beg him,

646
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:31,470
say we're refugees,

647
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:33,000
and ask him to give us something to eat.

648
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,110
You don't trust my acting skills?

649
00:23:36,190 --> 00:23:37,710
But don't roll down yourself.

650
00:23:37,710 --> 00:23:38,350
It's too dangerous.

651
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:39,470
I'll roll down in a bit.

652
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:42,760
Here he comes.

653
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:45,350
I'll go first.

654
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:45,950
Don't mess it up.

655
00:23:47,110 --> 00:23:47,680
You...

656
00:23:55,950 --> 00:23:56,470
Darling!

657
00:23:56,710 --> 00:23:57,560
Darling!

658
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:58,590
Are you okay?

659
00:23:58,590 --> 00:23:59,310
Darling!

660
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:01,000
Does it hurt?

661
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:01,560
Get up.

662
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:03,000
I'm starving.

663
00:24:03,070 --> 00:24:04,640
We aren't going to die here, are we?

664
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:05,230
No.

665
00:24:05,230 --> 00:24:05,880
I'll do something.

666
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:06,710
I'll think of something.

667
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:07,400
Get up.

668
00:24:09,310 --> 00:24:10,190
Come on, get up.

669
00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:13,710
What's going on here?

670
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:15,000
Sir.

671
00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:16,230
Sir, help us.

672
00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:17,880
Sir, please.

673
00:24:17,950 --> 00:24:19,000
Help us, please.

674
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,110
We're starving.

675
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:21,160
Sir.

676
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,230
Why are you so starving?

677
00:24:22,230 --> 00:24:22,920
Sir, we haven't eaten

678
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,400
for more than three days.

679
00:24:24,590 --> 00:24:25,680
Please give us something to eat.

680
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:27,070
I don't have anything to eat either.

681
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:28,070
Sir.

682
00:24:28,110 --> 00:24:29,830
But you have a cart full of stuff.

683
00:24:29,830 --> 00:24:30,430
Please give us something.

684
00:24:30,430 --> 00:24:31,880
That's all raw. It's inedible.

685
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,070
At least give us something to eat!

686
00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:35,950
Sir, I don't mind dying,

687
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:38,160
but my wife just got pregnant, Sir!

688
00:24:38,950 --> 00:24:39,760
Alright.

689
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:41,710
Alright then.

690
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:43,160
Come with me.

691
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:44,800
Thank you, Sir. Thank you.

692
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:46,190
Thank you, Sir. Thank you.

693
00:24:46,310 --> 00:24:47,230
Darling!

694
00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:50,310
Thank you.

695
00:24:50,310 --> 00:24:50,800
We're saved.

696
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:51,880
Get up.

697
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:55,110
Let's go find you something to eat.

698
00:24:55,230 --> 00:24:55,710
Thank you.

699
00:24:55,710 --> 00:24:56,190
Thank you, Sir.

700
00:24:56,350 --> 00:24:56,830
Thank you, Sir.

701
00:24:56,830 --> 00:24:57,190
Thank you.

702
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:12,560
Okay.

703
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:13,800
Just a moment.

704
00:25:29,950 --> 00:25:30,880
Here you are.

705
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:39,880
Eat quickly.

706
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:40,830
Finish it and leave.

707
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:42,560
Sir.

708
00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:44,560
You're such a good person.

709
00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:46,920
Please help us find a way to survive

710
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:47,710
in the mine.

711
00:25:47,710 --> 00:25:48,920
We can do anything.

712
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:50,110
You're wanting more?

713
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,520
Where do you come from?

714
00:25:54,230 --> 00:25:55,880
We used to run a food stall.

715
00:25:56,190 --> 00:25:57,230
We were cheated out of our business.

716
00:25:57,830 --> 00:25:58,800
We're really at our wits' end.

717
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,470
We wanted to go to a distant cousin.

718
00:26:00,590 --> 00:26:01,640
But then we found out

719
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,280
he's no longer with us.

720
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:04,950
We really don't know where to go.

721
00:26:04,950 --> 00:26:06,110
We can only beg along the way.

722
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:07,190
Sir,

723
00:26:07,350 --> 00:26:08,710
please take us in.

724
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:10,280
I used to be a cook.

725
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:11,350
I'm quite skilled.

726
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,000
Cooking isn't necessary.

727
00:26:14,470 --> 00:26:16,520
I need laborers for heavy work.

728
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:17,000
You two...

729
00:26:17,110 --> 00:26:17,830
We can do it.

730
00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:19,000
We... we can do anything.

731
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:20,880
Here, you must listen to me.

732
00:26:21,110 --> 00:26:21,800
Okay.

733
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,920
Sir, you've taken us in

734
00:26:23,950 --> 00:26:25,190
and saved us.

735
00:26:25,230 --> 00:26:26,280
We will definitely listen to you.

736
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:29,070
Come on.

737
00:26:29,070 --> 00:26:30,430
You two unload the vegetables.

738
00:26:32,830 --> 00:26:33,760
Take them to the kitchen.

739
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:01,190
Get out of the way!

740
00:27:03,110 --> 00:27:04,280
You don't seem very capable.

741
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:05,590
You two go wash the vegetables.

742
00:27:21,470 --> 00:27:22,160
Let me do it.

743
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,110
You can pick the vegetables.
The water is cold.

744
00:28:08,710 --> 00:28:09,470
Don't have the fire too high.

745
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:54,470
Wang Mao.

746
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:58,430
Hello, Gou.

747
00:28:59,710 --> 00:29:00,520
Welcome.

748
00:29:00,950 --> 00:29:02,350
What brings you here?

749
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,310
There's too much smoke inside.
Let's talk outside.

750
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:10,710
You've got newcomers here.

751
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:13,070
I can't manage everything on my own.

752
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:14,800
Those at the mine always complain to me.

753
00:29:15,470 --> 00:29:16,350
How's it going?

754
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:17,760
Have you gone to see the middleman?

755
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,430
Yes, he's keeping an eye on things.

756
00:29:20,470 --> 00:29:21,280
Gou,

757
00:29:21,590 --> 00:29:22,800
are you really going to buy directly?

758
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:25,430
If there's a suitable one,
I'll definitely buy.

759
00:29:25,470 --> 00:29:26,350
You know,

760
00:29:26,470 --> 00:29:27,710
we can't rely on the White Ants anymore.

761
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:29,430
Dayou is pushing us hard.

762
00:29:29,430 --> 00:29:30,680
We can't get out.

763
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,920
Just help me find someone suitable,

764
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:34,230
and I'll make sure you get paid well.

765
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:38,560
It's not about the money.

766
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:39,830
Gou, you know

767
00:29:39,830 --> 00:29:40,880
what I want.

768
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,760
You know it well.

769
00:29:42,950 --> 00:29:43,680
Dayou only accepts

770
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:45,160
the Qians.

771
00:29:45,590 --> 00:29:46,920
This matter depends on human effort.

772
00:29:47,070 --> 00:29:48,160
Please speak well of me

773
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,520
in front of the boss.

774
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:51,430
Then maybe this matter will work out.

775
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:52,350
Alright.

776
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:54,560
If you can help me find someone good,

777
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,000
you'll relieve my urgency.

778
00:29:56,190 --> 00:29:57,800
Leave it to me.

779
00:29:57,830 --> 00:29:58,760
Rest assured, Gou.

780
00:29:59,040 --> 00:29:59,560
Alright.

781
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:01,190
Notify me immediately if there's news.

782
00:30:01,190 --> 00:30:02,470
Okay, I will.

783
00:30:09,590 --> 00:30:10,880
Take care, Gou.

784
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:26,070
I'll do it.

785
00:30:26,070 --> 00:30:26,710
Can you handle it?

786
00:30:26,710 --> 00:30:27,560
I can.

787
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:29,280
Of course.

788
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:30,280
I can!

789
00:30:36,190 --> 00:30:37,350
Do you remember how to get there?

790
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:38,350
Yes, I do.

791
00:30:39,430 --> 00:30:40,160
Hurry up.

792
00:30:40,590 --> 00:30:41,310
Okay.

793
00:30:41,310 --> 00:30:42,310
Be careful. Don't spill it.

794
00:30:42,310 --> 00:30:42,710
Okay.

795
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:49,000
Do you think

796
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:51,160
going undercover like this will help?

797
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:52,830
Wang Mao wouldn't let us

798
00:30:52,830 --> 00:30:53,590
take it easy.

799
00:30:53,590 --> 00:30:54,640
He just makes us work.

800
00:30:55,350 --> 00:30:56,710
When do we have time to find clues?

801
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:58,590
Of course.

802
00:30:58,590 --> 00:30:59,830
I've already found something.

803
00:31:00,190 --> 00:31:01,110
Really?

804
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:03,110
What is it?

805
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:04,520
The food given to the miners

806
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:05,760
is all coarse stuff from large pots.

807
00:31:05,950 --> 00:31:07,190
But Wang Mao cooked

808
00:31:07,190 --> 00:31:08,190
a separate small pot of fine food.

809
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:09,040
Fine food?

810
00:31:10,110 --> 00:31:11,430
Isn't that what's in this box?

811
00:31:11,590 --> 00:31:12,160
I think

812
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:13,400
it's for Qian Dayou and the others.

813
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:14,560
This box

814
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:15,800
only has enough for four people.

815
00:31:16,190 --> 00:31:17,430
But that small pot of fine food

816
00:31:17,430 --> 00:31:18,830
is enough for ten people.

817
00:31:18,830 --> 00:31:20,590
And I heard Gou

818
00:31:20,590 --> 00:31:22,110
whispering with Wang Mao.

819
00:31:22,350 --> 00:31:24,160
He mentioned something about White Ants.

820
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:27,230
So,

821
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:29,520
you suspect

822
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,230
that food is for the girls?

823
00:31:34,710 --> 00:31:36,190
I think Wang Mao is very suspicious.

824
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:38,680
Do you think Wang Mao...?

825
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:45,710
He's a bad guy?

826
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:48,880
Do you want more?

827
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:50,070
Come on, have more.

828
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:50,950
Give me one.

829
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:53,230
There are still some corn buns.
Do you want more?

830
00:31:54,470 --> 00:31:55,680
Thank you.

831
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:58,110
Eating enough
gives the strength to work.

832
00:31:58,110 --> 00:31:58,800
Thank you.

833
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:00,470
Thank you.

834
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:04,830
Guys,

835
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:07,640
is working in the mine profitable?

836
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:08,520
If it were profitable,

837
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:09,310
I wouldn't be in the kitchen.

838
00:32:09,310 --> 00:32:10,520
I'd dig coal with you.

839
00:32:10,590 --> 00:32:11,590
What's the point?

840
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:12,880
Just enough to eat.

841
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:14,000
Working all day is exhausting.

842
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:14,880
No.

843
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:17,350
I see those two foremen over there.

844
00:32:17,350 --> 00:32:18,310
They seem to be dressed

845
00:32:18,310 --> 00:32:19,310
quite nicely.

846
00:32:19,350 --> 00:32:20,040
Foremen?

847
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:21,230
Not just those two.

848
00:32:21,590 --> 00:32:22,680
There are four of them.

849
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,760
Qian Sigou, Qian Jintian,

850
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:26,040
Qian Dasong, and Qian Yue.

851
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:27,280
They are all relatives of the boss.

852
00:32:27,590 --> 00:32:29,190
They usually serve the boss.

853
00:32:29,310 --> 00:32:30,640
As long as the boss is happy,

854
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,000
they can get rich too.

855
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:33,000
Exactly.

856
00:32:33,310 --> 00:32:34,000
No worries.

857
00:32:34,230 --> 00:32:35,110
Let's fill

858
00:32:35,110 --> 00:32:35,830
our stomachs first.

859
00:32:35,830 --> 00:32:37,190
Okay, thanks.

860
00:32:37,310 --> 00:32:37,800
Here.

861
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:38,880
Thank you.

862
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:39,590
No problem.

863
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:40,710
Have more.

864
00:32:42,590 --> 00:32:44,280
I heard the new magistrate

865
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:45,520
is a hot-headed rookie.

866
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:46,680
He won't take no for an answer.

867
00:32:49,070 --> 00:32:50,560
There must be someone behind him.

868
00:32:51,230 --> 00:32:53,040
Otherwise,
how could he be sent to Pingyangwei

869
00:32:53,590 --> 00:32:55,070
to deal with the White Ants?

870
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:56,160
Alright.

871
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:57,230
Dayou has ordered.

872
00:32:57,430 --> 00:32:58,920
We need to keep a close watch.

873
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:00,070
Don't let anything slip.

874
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:01,680
Understood.

875
00:33:02,590 --> 00:33:03,760
Those who came to buy coal

876
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:05,760
a few days ago

877
00:33:05,950 --> 00:33:07,760
looked like trouble.

878
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:10,000
Dayou is worried about trouble.

879
00:33:10,710 --> 00:33:13,400
What trouble could come from this mine?

880
00:33:14,070 --> 00:33:15,400
Just pay attention
to those unfamiliar faces.

881
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:16,110
That will do.

882
00:33:20,430 --> 00:33:23,160
This ugly woman looks unfamiliar.

883
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:26,800
Sir,

884
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,560
I work in the kitchen

885
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:29,920
for Wang Mao.

886
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:30,680
Wang Mao?

887
00:33:31,230 --> 00:33:32,040
I saw her

888
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:32,710
at Wang Mao's today.

889
00:33:33,950 --> 00:33:35,040
He's just a cook.

890
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:36,310
When did he get subordinates?

891
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:38,830
Yue, did you eat?

892
00:33:39,070 --> 00:33:40,110
No, I didn't.

893
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,400
I've had an upset stomach all day.

894
00:33:49,190 --> 00:33:51,400
Why don't you pray in your room?

895
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:54,040
What are you doing here?

896
00:33:54,310 --> 00:33:56,070
You've been acting suspiciously
during the day.

897
00:33:56,070 --> 00:33:56,710
Tell me.

898
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:57,880
What is your intention?

899
00:34:02,710 --> 00:34:03,800
Come on.

900
00:34:08,910 --> 00:34:09,710
Wait a moment.

901
00:34:15,430 --> 00:34:16,120
Where are my chopsticks?

902
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:31,360
What's wrong?

903
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:33,800
Why are you staring at that ugly woman?

904
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:35,040
Are you craving women?

905
00:34:36,950 --> 00:34:38,560
Let's eat.

906
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:39,520
Are you sure?

907
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:40,870
Yes, I am.

908
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:41,630
It's him.

909
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:43,800
They call him Qian Yue,

910
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:45,560
but I know he is Bai Yue.

911
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:46,360
Now that you know

912
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:47,600
he's a fugitive
from the incense hall case,

913
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:48,120
why not

914
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:48,910
tell Han Muzhi

915
00:34:48,910 --> 00:34:50,190
to have him arrested?

916
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:52,120
It's dangerous for us

917
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:53,040
to stay here.

918
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:55,190
No, we can't act rashly.

919
00:34:55,470 --> 00:34:56,230
But we can't just wait...

920
00:34:59,950 --> 00:35:00,760
Mr. Wang,

921
00:35:01,710 --> 00:35:03,280
are you helping us settle in?

922
00:35:04,630 --> 00:35:05,360
Come with me.

923
00:35:22,870 --> 00:35:23,670
Is this the place?

924
00:35:24,670 --> 00:35:25,190
Yes.

925
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:30,190
Where's the bed?

926
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:33,320
You set it up yourself.

927
00:35:33,430 --> 00:35:35,000
Is this even a place for people?

928
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,190
You're being too unreasonable.

929
00:35:36,190 --> 00:35:37,120
There are clearly vacant rooms.

930
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:38,000
Isn't this unfair?

931
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:38,520
Why not let us

932
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:39,320
stay there?

933
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,190
This place is nice.

934
00:35:41,390 --> 00:35:42,760
It doesn't leak wind or rain.

935
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:43,630
It's better than us

936
00:35:43,630 --> 00:35:44,950
sleeping outside.

937
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:46,520
You go outside

938
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:47,760
and find some straw.

939
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,390
It'll be warm enough on top.

940
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:52,150
Go on.

941
00:35:56,950 --> 00:35:58,670
He has a child's temperament.

942
00:35:58,670 --> 00:36:00,120
Please don't take offense.

943
00:36:30,710 --> 00:36:31,910
You sleep on the bed,

944
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:33,230
I'll sleep on the floor.

945
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,800
You haven't been in a woodshed

946
00:36:37,710 --> 00:36:39,040
or slept on a door plank.

947
00:36:39,710 --> 00:36:41,000
Though it's not as comfortable as a bed,

948
00:36:41,230 --> 00:36:42,520
you can give it a try.

949
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:44,320
It might be a different experience.

950
00:36:44,670 --> 00:36:45,630
You... It's alright.

951
00:36:45,630 --> 00:36:46,430
Have a rest.

952
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:47,600
Just sit down.

953
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:49,230
I...

954
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:51,280
Being strong and full of energy,

955
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:52,280
I can sleep anywhere.

956
00:36:53,430 --> 00:36:54,470
Weren't you just saying

957
00:36:54,470 --> 00:36:55,670
you wanted a bed?

958
00:36:55,670 --> 00:36:56,910
I was worried you would get cold.

959
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:02,120
It's chilly in the late autumn.

960
00:37:02,230 --> 00:37:02,840
What if a girl like you

961
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:04,000
gets cold?

962
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:08,000
Then we can take turns.

963
00:37:08,190 --> 00:37:09,000
You sleep first.

964
00:37:09,150 --> 00:37:10,390
I'll wake you up in two hours.

965
00:37:10,870 --> 00:37:12,670
Let's not make it complicated.

966
00:37:13,230 --> 00:37:14,430
Then no one will sleep well.

967
00:37:14,430 --> 00:37:15,230
Look,

968
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:16,230
there's so much straw.

969
00:37:16,230 --> 00:37:17,320
I'll spread it on the floor.

970
00:37:18,150 --> 00:37:19,760
It'll be much more comfortable
than your bed.

971
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:45,230
What are you drawing?

972
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:46,950
A map.

973
00:37:47,430 --> 00:37:48,840
Just organizing my thoughts.

974
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:50,710
This is

975
00:37:50,710 --> 00:37:52,280
the mining area where we deliver meals.

976
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:54,280
Workers come in and out here.

977
00:37:54,390 --> 00:37:56,000
They wouldn't hide the girls here.

978
00:37:58,670 --> 00:38:00,040
But this mine is so large...

979
00:38:06,710 --> 00:38:08,430
We still need to explore more.

980
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,520
Are you really going
to sleep on the floor?

981
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:20,800
Of course.

982
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:33,600
To be fair,

983
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:34,710
you should have the quilt.

984
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:41,320
Why don't we

985
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:44,600
share the quilt?

986
00:38:45,390 --> 00:38:47,080
You never have a serious moment, do you?

987
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:48,950
I'm just worried you'll get cold.

988
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:51,000
I don't mean anything else.

989
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:51,760
Keep it.

990
00:38:52,190 --> 00:38:53,390
I'll manage with this.

991
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:18,910
Luo Shu.

992
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:23,520
Luo Shu, are you asleep?

993
00:39:24,710 --> 00:39:25,520
What's wrong?

994
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:32,320
I keep thinking and I'm still worried.

995
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:33,710
What if in the future,

996
00:39:33,710 --> 00:39:34,560
you see that Bai Yue again?

997
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:35,470
What will you do?

998
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:37,840
How about this?

999
00:39:38,230 --> 00:39:39,560
You can go back tomorrow.

1000
00:39:40,150 --> 00:39:41,360
I'll stay here.

1001
00:39:42,470 --> 00:39:43,390
No way.

1002
00:39:43,870 --> 00:39:45,760
Bai Yue saw me today.

1003
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:47,950
If I suddenly leave like this,

1004
00:39:48,230 --> 00:39:50,040
it will definitely raise his suspicion.

1005
00:39:51,630 --> 00:39:52,560
It's fine.

1006
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:54,910
In my current state,

1007
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:56,230
even if I stand in front of him,

1008
00:39:56,230 --> 00:39:57,390
he won't recognize me.

1009
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:59,150
Don't worry.

1010
00:39:59,190 --> 00:40:00,600
I'll be careful.

1011
00:40:16,670 --> 00:40:19,760
I saw your hands today.

1012
00:40:23,430 --> 00:40:25,040
The work here is dirty and exhausting.

1013
00:40:25,470 --> 00:40:26,630
If you can't handle it anymore...

1014
00:40:26,630 --> 00:40:27,630
I can.

1015
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:32,840
Wherever you are, I'll be there too.

1016
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:14,430
What are you looking at?

1017
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:17,560
Why aren't you sleeping?

1018
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:18,710
What are you staring at?

1019
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:28,950
Your makeup is so ugly.

1020
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:30,910
Who are you scaring?

1021
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:32,800
Didn't you say

1022
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,390
the uglier it is, the better?

1023
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:36,520
Now you can relax, right?

1024
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:38,390
Bai Yue won't recognize me.

1025
00:41:46,190 --> 00:41:47,000
Good night.

1026
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,760
