A vegetable delivery man told me.

5
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:37,000
[Linfen Yamen]
I don't know what's going on.

6
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,360
[Linfen Yamen]
Let's go find Miaocui.

7
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:39,800

10
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:43,950
What brings you back?

11
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:44,550
Mr. Cai,

12
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:45,550
I have something to ask you.

13
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:47,190
Miss Luo, hold on a second.

14
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:48,720
Miaocui might be in trouble.

15
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:50,160
What happened?

16
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:51,590
Someone delivered a message,

17
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:52,760
saying that Miss Jin had a tough time

18
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:53,550
in Mingke House

19
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:54,550
and asked us to save her.

20
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:55,630
Miaocui asked him to deliver a message

21
00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:56,270
to Cai.

22
00:01:56,270 --> 00:01:56,910
Yes.

23
00:01:58,230 --> 00:01:59,040
You just said

24
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:00,800
a vegetable delivery man
sent you the message?

25
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:03,040
Oh, no.

26
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:04,870
What happened to Miaocui?

27
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,040
I just went to Mingke House
to look for Miaocui,

28
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:08,910
but Madam Yu threw me out.

29
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:10,320
Before I went to Taiyuan,

30
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,000
I told her

31
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:11,670
if she was in trouble,

32
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:13,440
she could come here for help.

33
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:14,830
I didn't expect she sent the message

34
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:15,470
in this way.

35
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:16,470
She must be in trouble.

36

37
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:19,320
Wait, you stay here.

38
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,080
We'll go.

39
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:20,880
Let's go.

40
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:22,000
Mr. Cai, I...

41
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,320
You're not an official anymore,

42
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,800
and you just got kicked out.

43
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:26,440
It might be counter-productive
for you to go.

44
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:28,110
Baozi, you stay here with Miss Luo.

45
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:28,960

Cut the crap. Where is she?

78
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,440
I'll ask her myself when I see her.

79

I'm afraid you can't.

stay in your room.

Thank you for your kindness.

134

Why didn't you

139

bring Miaocui back?

a document.

143
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:24,040
We were in a rush

144
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:24,760
and we forgot about it.

145

She is so cunning.

151
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:36,270
She knows that
without the official document,

152
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:37,790
they cannot arrest people.

153
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,110
But right now,

154
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,600
we know nothing

about Miss Jin's situation,

156

and we don't have

157
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:43,390
any evidence of her being persecuted.

158
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:45,270
If we insist on issuing the document,

159
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:47,390
we might provoke the people behind her

160
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:48,390
and be accused of using power
for personal gain.

161
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:49,350
Even so,

162
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:50,950
I have to do it.

163
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:52,320
Your Honor,

164
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:54,600
Mr. Chen is right.

165
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:56,270
Miaocui's situation is unclear.

166
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:57,670
It's all our speculation.

167
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:59,720
If you get implicated because of this,

168
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:01,720
I won't forgive myself.

169
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,480
What should we do now?

170
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,270
We could find

171
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:08,270
a new face

172
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:09,160
to pretend to be a guest

173
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,270
and check things out.

174
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:12,000
It's...

175
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:24,160
No.

176
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,350
That's Music House.

177

If my wife finds out,

178
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:28,480
you will have to find another coroner

179
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,440
to collect my body.

180
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:30,720
I can't do this.

181

My brother can do this.

182

He can do it.

183
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,390
I can't go there.

She knows me.

186
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:45,350
You're right.

187
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,200
I'm sorry.

188
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:50,160
Let's think of another way.

189
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:52,270
I have an idea.

190
00:07:59,440 --> 00:07:59,950
Lian Shu can go.

[Linfen Yamen]
Why can't Lian Shu go?

192

You've always been rational.

00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:07,350
did you come to the wrong door?

222
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:10,200
No.

Why are you here?

sudden death during the intercourse.

00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Where's the body?

283
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:14,960

are you gonna kill me?

289
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,670
When girls from the side courtyard died,

290
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,790
you always wrapped their bodies
in an old straw mat

291
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:26,320
and threw them away
at the mass grave out of town.

292
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:28,640
The gate is about to close.

293
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,640
Why are you in such a rush to do this?

294
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,590
What are you trying to conceal?

295
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:35,790
I didn't conceal anything.

296
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:38,110
I have to do business.

297
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:39,790
You want me to leave the body here,

298
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:41,350

299
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,030
You're lying.

300
00:11:43,710 --> 00:11:45,670
You've been lying from beginning to end.

301
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:47,760
Miaocui was one of top girls

302
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,280
in Mingke House.

303
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:52,640
How could you let her
go to the side courtyard?

304
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,880
Just to torture her?

305
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:57,520
She willingly came back

306
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:59,150
to Mingke House with you.

307
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,910
You raised her.

308
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:03,840
Why won't you leave her alone?

309
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:07,790
I have to set an example.

310
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:12,000

if they try to run away.

313
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:19,640
You encouraged Miaocui to escape.

314
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:22,470
You killed her.

315
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:24,110

00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,280
before offering them?

325
00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:07,550

Starving yourself

339
00:17:22,430 --> 00:17:24,680

Don't be stubborn.

You don't yield,
even though you've been caught.

345
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,040
Why are you asking for trouble?

346
00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:46,230
If I get a chance next time,
I'll run away again.

347
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:47,920
Then you should eat.

348
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:48,760

00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:49,680

starving yourself

353

won't hurt Madam.

00:17:54,830 --> 00:17:55,800

00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:18,830

held onto her

and didn't let her go back to Mingke House,

363
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:27,520

364
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,110
be alive today.

365
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:33,680
Madam Yu was right.

366
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,470
I killed her.

367
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:39,160
How could you

368
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,190
actually believe her words?

369
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:41,430
Everyone could see that

370
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:41,950

371
00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:43,160
was trying to bring you down.

372
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:44,640
You can't let her get her way.

373
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:47,110
I took her out of there,

374
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,920
but I didn't take care of her.

375
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:52,400
I let her go back to that hell.

376
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:56,710
She even had to

377
00:18:57,830 --> 00:18:59,230
suffer for me.

378
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:03,950
Qi Menglin.

379
00:19:06,430 --> 00:19:07,800
Miaocui is dead.

380
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,430
She's really dead.

381
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:17,800
I'll never see her again.

382
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:22,470
I'll never see her again.

383
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:23,710
I'm here.

384
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:26,950
I'll never see her again.

385
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,710
I'm here.

386
00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:42,160
I'm here, Luo Shu.

387
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:45,020
[Mortuary]

388
00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:46,160
I'm here.

389
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:48,560
I'm here.

390
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:04,340
[Mortuary]

391
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Before Miss Jin died,

392
00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:12,950
she was already very weak.

393
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:15,040
It was hanging on by a thread.

394
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:17,950
But she didn't die of natural causes.

395
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:20,160
She was strangled to death.

396
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:30,950
I found traces of human skin

397
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:32,920
under her fingernails,

398
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:35,470
which were likely scratched off

399
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:36,830
from the murderer

400
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,760
when she struggled before her death.

401
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:40,680
That could be the last guest.

402
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:42,310
Lian Shu

403
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:44,350
saw him running out screaming,

404
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:45,710
covered with blood.

405
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:47,400
But

406
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:49,640
if he really killed her,

407
00:20:50,430 --> 00:20:52,040
why did he scream?

408
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,280
As if afraid that others wouldn't know?

409
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:56,680
Maybe he didn't mean to kill her.

410
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:57,830
It was an accident.

411
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,160
That's possible.

412
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:03,880
Some guests have kinky behavior.

413
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,070
They like to do violence.

414
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,190
He's even worse than an animal.

415
00:21:12,430 --> 00:21:13,230
Where are you going?

416
00:21:14,310 --> 00:21:15,350
I'm gonna go to ask

417
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,000
who that person is.

418
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:18,430
Let me go.

419
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:19,710
That procuress

420
00:21:19,710 --> 00:21:20,800
is obviously against you.

421
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:22,560
You won't find out anything.

422
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:30,640
Leave it to me.

423
00:21:31,710 --> 00:21:33,000
Tomorrow morning,

424
00:21:34,230 --> 00:21:35,590

00:21:54,190 --> 00:21:55,920
What a dump!

427
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:58,040
Is this fit for living?

428
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:01,590
You take a break.

429
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:03,280
We're supposed to live together.

430
00:22:04,310 --> 00:22:06,430
Why should you do all the work alone?

431
00:22:29,230 --> 00:22:31,000
Your Honor, Mr. Chen.

432
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,470
I'm sorry

433
00:22:39,430 --> 00:22:40,310
for Jin Miaocui.

434
00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:42,520
Thank you for your concern.

435
00:22:43,310 --> 00:22:44,350
I came to ask you a favor.

436
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:45,230
Go ahead.

437
00:22:45,830 --> 00:22:46,640
I want to find out

438
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,040
the truth behind Miaocui's death.

439
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:49,280
But I'm not

440

take charge of this case.

to the side courtyard of Mingke House.

Don't come after me.

Stop it.

461
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:50,590
I didn't mean it.

462
00:23:50,710 --> 00:23:51,640
I didn't do it on purpose.

463
00:23:51,710 --> 00:23:53,040
I didn't know she would die like that.

464
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:54,040
She died in front of you.

465
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:55,000
You didn't mean it?

466
00:23:55,070 --> 00:23:56,470
You monster.

467
00:23:56,950 --> 00:23:58,230
Miss Jin had no quarrel with you.

468
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,310
Why did you kill her?

469
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:00,160
Why did you kill her?

470
00:24:00,430 --> 00:24:01,160
Why?

471
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:06,160
I had no quarrel with her,

472
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:08,830
how would I kill her?

473
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:11,190
Actually, I didn't do anything

474
00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:12,070
out of line.

475
00:24:12,430 --> 00:24:13,590
What did you do?

476
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:14,680
Say it.

477
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:16,000
Did you strangle Miss Jin to death?

478
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:16,400
Say it.

479
00:24:16,710 --> 00:24:17,520
Did you do that?

480
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:18,590
Strangle her to death?

481
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:19,680
No.

482
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:22,230

483
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:23,830

00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:26,350
I swear to God,

485
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:28,350
I didn't kill her on purpose.

486
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:29,950
I didn't strangle her either!

487
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:33,350
What happened in Jin Miaocui's room

488
00:24:33,350 --> 00:24:34,800
that day?

489
00:24:36,110 --> 00:24:38,040
Tell me without omitting anything.

490
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,190
Say it.

491
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:43,430
Alright, I'll say.

492
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:47,710
Back then I opened the door.

493
00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:49,920
Miaocui.

494
00:24:57,590 --> 00:24:58,430
Oh my goodness.

495
00:24:58,470 --> 00:24:59,160
Oh no.

496
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:05,230
When you left,

497
00:25:06,350 --> 00:25:07,710
was Miss Jin alive or dead?

498
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:11,680
When I left,

499
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:15,280
Miss Jin was weak,

500
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:17,110
but she was still breathing.

501
00:25:19,590 --> 00:25:21,230
Please don't arrest me.

502
00:25:22,110 --> 00:25:23,280
I didn't kill her.

503
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:24,590
It wasn't me.

504
00:25:24,830 --> 00:25:26,110
It wasn't me.

505
00:25:26,310 --> 00:25:27,230
I didn't kill her.

506
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,190
It wasn't me.

507
00:25:33,310 --> 00:25:34,640
If Guo Xing isn't the murderer,

508
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:42,110
Madam Yu

509
00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:44,190
will be the most suspicious.

510
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:45,110
She?

511
00:25:47,470 --> 00:25:48,430
Miaocui

512
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,470
was the cash cow of Mingke House.

513
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,040
Madam Yu could have used
plenty of methods

514
00:25:53,950 --> 00:25:56,160
to punish her to set an example.

515
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:58,160
Madam Yu

516
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:59,430
likes nothing but money.

517
00:26:00,190 --> 00:26:01,520
She wouldn't choose a method

518
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:03,400
to prevent her from making money.

519
00:26:05,590 --> 00:26:08,190
When I went to look for Miaocui
that day,

520
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:09,760
she concealed

521
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:10,800
Miaocui's situation from me.

522
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,190
She was extremely nervous
when she saw me.

523
00:26:13,470 --> 00:26:15,040
She was obviously covering something up.

524
00:26:16,590 --> 00:26:18,040
As long as you're willing to let her go,

525
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:19,230
you name the price.

526
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,470
If it's not enough, I'll gather more.

527
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:26,710
Take the money.

528
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:29,430
Don't even think about redeeming her.

529
00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:32,520
This money is all yours.

530
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:35,070
Just let me see Miaocui for a moment,

531
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:36,070
is that okay?

532
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:39,400
She's out right now.

533
00:26:41,310 --> 00:26:42,920
When she saw us last night,

534
00:26:43,190 --> 00:26:44,280
she was frightened.

535
00:26:44,590 --> 00:26:46,400
That reaction can't be faked.

536
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:47,430
Get out.

537
00:26:50,190 --> 00:26:51,000
Don't run.

538
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:59,000
Where is she? Where's Miaocui?

539
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:01,590
Miaocui?

540
00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:05,040
She's dead.

541
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:08,350
What was she afraid of?

542
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:11,310
Officer, why are you back?

543
00:27:11,310 --> 00:27:12,000
Get out of my way.

544
00:27:12,350 --> 00:27:13,560
Where is Madam?

545
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:14,350
Madam.

546
00:27:14,350 --> 00:27:15,070
Who's looking for me?

547
00:27:15,470 --> 00:27:17,590
It's okay. Everyone, keep going.

548
00:27:19,830 --> 00:27:21,400
Let's go talk inside.

549
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:25,350
No need.

550
00:27:25,350 --> 00:27:26,470
Let's just go talk in the yamen.

551
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:28,230
Why should I go to the yamen?

552
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:29,680
We suspect you killed Jin Miaocui.

553
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:32,230
She's dead?

554
00:27:32,230 --> 00:27:33,430
Madam killed her?

555
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,800
It's a misunderstanding.

556
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:37,590
A misunderstanding.

557
00:27:37,590 --> 00:27:38,800
She died in Mingke House.

558
00:27:39,350 --> 00:27:40,520
You can't get out of it.

559
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:41,590
You slander me.

560
00:27:41,590 --> 00:27:42,110
Go.

561
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:46,640
Behave.

562
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,000
I'm innocent.

563
00:28:05,590 --> 00:28:06,800
I told you

564
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:08,280
I didn't kill her.

565
00:28:08,590 --> 00:28:10,160
Then how do you explain
the injury on your hand?

566
00:28:10,590 --> 00:28:12,470
I scratched it myself.

567
00:28:13,950 --> 00:28:15,520
If you have evidence,

568
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:17,350
bring me to the court.

569
00:28:17,350 --> 00:28:18,110
What's the meaning of

570
00:28:18,110 --> 00:28:19,430
keeping me here?

571
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:21,710
Are you trying to take revenge
personally

572
00:28:21,710 --> 00:28:22,640
and force a confession through torture?

573
00:28:23,350 --> 00:28:24,800
I don't think she's the murderer.

574
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:27,470
Based on the choking marks,

575
00:28:27,710 --> 00:28:28,680
the murderer is either

576
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:30,040
a woman with large hands and feet,

577
00:28:30,230 --> 00:28:31,280
or a man.

578
00:28:31,830 --> 00:28:33,310
Her hands are small and slender,

579
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:35,160
not matching those marks.

580
00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:37,760
Do you hear that?

581
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:39,520
He's on your side.

582
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:41,560
He said I didn't kill her.

583
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:42,830
It wasn't me.

584
00:28:43,350 --> 00:28:44,160
You.

585
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:46,190
You're an ingrate.

586
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:48,800
I raised you with good food and clothes,

587
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:50,430
but you bit the hand that feeds you.

588
00:28:50,430 --> 00:28:51,230
Come on,

590
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:54,920
Why did you bluff?

591
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:56,950
Are you feeling guilty?

592
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:58,710
Guilty?

593
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:00,640
I don't feel guilty at all.

594
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:02,590
I have done nothing wrong.

595
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,710
Ordering someone to kill is also murder.

596

Those servants in the Mingke House,

597
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:08,400
who dares not follow your orders?

598
00:29:09,070 --> 00:29:10,470

I'll sue you to
the prefectural magistrate.

604
00:29:15,710 --> 00:29:16,950
The magistrate personally ordered us

605
00:29:17,470 --> 00:29:18,190
to thoroughly investigate

606
00:29:18,190 --> 00:29:19,430
this murder case.

You want to sue
to the prefectural magistrate?

609
00:29:24,830 --> 00:29:25,640
What?

610
00:29:26,110 --> 00:29:27,710
Is there anyone backing you up?

If I tell you, you'll be scared.

to secretly send a letter
to the yamen.

647
00:32:08,590 --> 00:32:10,680

and don't take it to heart.

762
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:23,040
Madam,

763
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:25,040
about the thing you promised,

764
00:37:25,150 --> 00:37:26,390
you can go back to find it,

765
00:37:26,390 --> 00:37:27,560
I'll come to pick it up tomorrow.

766
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:29,280
What?

767
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:30,840
What did I promise you?

768
00:37:47,470 --> 00:37:49,600
I didn't reveal a single word.

769
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:51,280
I swear.

770
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:52,800
If I betray you

771
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,390
and Master,

772
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:55,950
I'll be struck by lightning

773
00:37:55,950 --> 00:37:57,080
and meet a terrible end.

774
00:37:57,430 --> 00:37:58,470
The county jail

775
00:37:58,670 --> 00:37:59,390
is a place

776
00:37:59,390 --> 00:38:02,040
where people suffer great pain.

777
00:38:02,390 --> 00:38:03,800
You've been in jail for days.

778
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:05,710
How did you manage

779
00:38:05,710 --> 00:38:06,630
to come back

780
00:38:06,630 --> 00:38:08,150
unharmed?

781
00:38:08,670 --> 00:38:10,150
I...

782
00:38:10,430 --> 00:38:11,560
I'd rather die than confess.

783
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:12,670
They couldn't do anything to me,

784
00:38:12,670 --> 00:38:14,080
so they sent me back.

785
00:38:14,390 --> 00:38:15,230
Really?

786
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:18,360
Mr. Li,

787
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:19,760
I would never

788
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:21,150
betray you and Master.

789
00:38:21,150 --> 00:38:22,040
You have to believe me.

790
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:23,320
Please believe me.

791
00:38:28,910 --> 00:38:30,520
Get up.

792
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:31,950
Stand up.

793
00:38:35,670 --> 00:38:37,120
I appreciate

794
00:38:37,390 --> 00:38:39,320
what you have done.

795
00:38:40,670 --> 00:38:41,520
Don't worry.

796
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:03,100
[If you want to stay alive,
cooperate with me.]

797
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:07,800
I didn't say anything.

798
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:09,630
Why do you want to kill me?

799
00:40:10,390 --> 00:40:11,910
Mr. Li said that

800
00:40:12,150 --> 00:40:14,190
only the dead can keep secrets.

801
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:16,120
Keep all the secrets

802
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:17,800
buried deep inside.

803
00:40:27,950 --> 00:40:28,760
Don't run.

804
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:31,560
Chase him.

805
00:40:41,150 --> 00:40:42,430
Don't kill me.

806
00:40:47,190 --> 00:40:49,000
Jin Nang.

807
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:49,630
No matter

808
00:40:49,630 --> 00:40:51,190
who frightens you,

809
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:53,800
they don't want you to live anymore.

810
00:40:56,150 --> 00:40:57,360
We didn't lie to you, did we?

811
00:40:58,910 --> 00:40:59,950
If it weren't for us today,

812
00:41:00,390 --> 00:41:01,910
you would already be dead.

813
00:41:03,190 --> 00:41:04,040
Tell us

814
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:05,760
everything you know.

815
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:10,760
Okay, I'll say.

816
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:12,870
Who was that person just now?

817
00:41:14,430 --> 00:41:15,280
Que Si.

818
00:41:16,630 --> 00:41:18,120
It was Que Si.

819
00:41:21,630 --> 00:41:23,120
He works for Mr. Li.

820
00:41:23,670 --> 00:41:26,150
Mr. Li is the real head

821
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:28,040
of Mingke House.

822
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:30,870
Don't worry,

823
00:41:30,910 --> 00:41:32,230
I can handle it.

824
00:41:32,230 --> 00:41:33,430
I won't let them

825
00:41:33,430 --> 00:41:34,760
make any mistakes again.

826
00:41:34,910 --> 00:41:36,190
You better.

827
00:41:37,150 --> 00:41:38,840
If there's anything wrong,

828
00:41:39,470 --> 00:41:42,670
my men won't show mercy.

829
00:41:43,950 --> 00:41:45,040
Mr. Li.

830
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:48,190
Jin Nang,

831
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:50,080
do you remember?

832
00:41:50,470 --> 00:41:51,470
When you were young,

833
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:53,000
I was competing with Wuniang

834
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:54,910
for the position of Madam.

835
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:57,080
I remember.

836
00:41:57,630 --> 00:41:59,320
We fought fiercely.

837
00:41:59,950 --> 00:42:03,560
Wuniang was more cunning

838
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:05,230
and ruthless than me,

839
00:42:05,910 --> 00:42:06,910
but finally,

840
00:42:07,430 --> 00:42:08,560
it was me

841
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:10,000
who got the position of Madam.

842
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:11,390
It's simple.

843
00:42:12,950 --> 00:42:15,670
Mr. Li thought I was obedient

844
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:17,390
and easy to be controlled.

845
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:28,120
Wuniang, time for your medicine.

846
00:42:35,430 --> 00:42:38,910
Yuniang, you won't have a good end.

847
00:42:40,150 --> 00:42:41,470
You won't have a good end.

848
00:42:47,430 --> 00:42:48,800
Wuniang...

849
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:55,280
Wuniang's death…

850
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:57,630
Of course they killed her.
