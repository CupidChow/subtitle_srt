00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,000
For the common people, it's a disaster.

5
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:40,950
But for us, it's a great opportunity.

6
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:44,040
Gather everyone immediately

7
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:47,040
and buy up as much grain

8
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,000
as you can from the market.

9
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,120
Stock it up.

10
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:52,270
I'll let you know

Yes, Mr. Qin.

14
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:03,910
Mr. Qin.

15
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:05,630
Que Si is back.

16
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:07,440
Let him in.

Yes.

I'm useless.

19
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:26,270
I messed up the task you gave me.

20
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,520
Please punish me.

21
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:29,880
Punish you?

22
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,320
How do you think I should punish you?

Mr. Qin.

You messed up my task

27

and have no excuses.

28
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,110

You messed up something important,

and I shouldn't let you off easy.

32
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:31,470
But you've been with me for years,

your ruthlessness.

There's another major task

that needs you to do.

37
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,000
So I'll put this mistake of yours aside.

38

You can make amends.

39

Thank you, Mr. Qin.

Mr. Qin, with the current disaster,

132
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:11,280
a major famine will surely follow.

133
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:13,230
It's not that we don't want
to lend grain.

134
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:15,000
It's just that we don't have enough
at home.

135
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,840
It looks like this year's crops
are ruined.

136

Even if

140
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:23,150
we have any grain left,

141
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:23,960
we'll need

142
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,230
to take care of our families first.

143
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:26,710
Exactly.

144
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:27,840
We hope you understand, Mr. Qin.

145
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:28,640

146
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:29,440

Please understand, Mr. Qin.

149

We need your understanding.

150

Please take a seat.

151
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:44,000
During this unusual time,

152
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,550
it's natural

153
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:47,030
that you have these concerns.

154
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,080
I want to make it clear.

155
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:52,110
The yamen is borrowing grain,

156
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:53,790
not taking it by force.

157
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,710
There's a saying,

158
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:01,150
“Good manners in borrowing and returning

159
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:02,280
avoid problems later.”

160
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,080
Exactly, exactly.

161
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:04,400
I can

162
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,470
assure you all

163
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:07,840
that any grain borrowed

164
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,150
will be repaid in full,

165
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:10,670
with interest.

166
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:13,030
The repayment won't be next year

167
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,520
or the year after.

168
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:18,200
It will be within three months.

169
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:20,280
I will definitely repay it.

170
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:22,080
Three months?

171
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,000
That's impossible, Mr. Han.

172
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,230
In three months,
the disaster will still be severe.

173
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:28,520
How can you repay the grain?

174
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:30,640
Exactly.

175
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:31,760
Exactly. Three months?

176
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:35,640
The court is already aware
of the disaster in Shanxi.

177
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:39,000
Two days ago, I submitted a petition

178
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:40,880
to Mr. Liu, the provincial governor,

179
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:42,550
and Mr. Zhao,
the administrative commissioner.

180
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:44,840
Once the relief grain from the court

181
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,320
is distributed,

182
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,670
I will prioritize repaying you all.

183
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,880
Even if the court
allocates relief grain,

184
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:54,320
there are many counties in Shanxi

185
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,350
that have been affected.

186
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:57,000
How could the provincial governor

187
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,030
give priority to Linfen?

188
00:10:59,030 --> 00:11:00,520
Exactly.

189
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,550
You can be assured of this.

190
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:06,880
Linfen was the first to be affected.

191
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,910
The situation here is the worst.

192
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:12,280
Mr. Liu will definitely
understand our needs

193
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,640
and help us in our time of crisis.

194
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,590
What grain is available?

195
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:20,880
How could we get priority?

196
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:32,000
Well then,

197
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,150
those willing to lend grain,

198
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:39,960
I

199
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:42,400
will not only thank you
on behalf of the people of Linfen,

200
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:44,000
but I will also honor the lenders
with a merit stele.

201
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,110
Their names will be remembered forever.

202
00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:47,710
I will also petition the court

203
00:11:47,710 --> 00:11:49,320
to exempt you from taxes for two years.

204
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:52,320
For those who don't want to lend,

205
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,200
please enjoy this cup of tea,

206
00:11:54,470 --> 00:11:55,640
and feel free to leave.

207
00:11:56,030 --> 00:11:56,790
From now on,

208
00:11:56,790 --> 00:11:58,230
in Linfen,

209
00:11:58,230 --> 00:11:59,200
I will handle everything
according to the rules.

210
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,230
I will not show any favoritism.

211
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:10,670
Repay us the principal and interest.

212
00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:12,280
And tax exemptions are possible.

213
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:14,840
Mr. Han, is that for real?

214
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:16,030
I,

215
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:18,200
as the magistrate of Linfen,

216
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,710
am willing to issue a promissory note,

217
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:20,910
and put my official seal on it.

218
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:21,790
How about that?

219
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:23,590
With an official seal too?

220
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:25,080
Great, Mr. Han!

221
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:25,960
Mr. Han, good.

222
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:27,550
With such integrity, Mr. Han,

223
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:28,840
what do we have to fear?

224
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:29,280
Right?

225
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:30,520
We have nothing to fear now.

226
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:32,000
Now we can relax.

227
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,200
Exactly, thank you, Mr. Han!

228
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,230
The grain will just sit there anyway.

229
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:36,000
Isn't that right?

230
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:38,520
Alright, I agree!

231
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:39,840
Mr. Han. I agree.

232
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,440
I'll lend some too.

233
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:51,590
Father!

234
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:53,960
You're here.

235
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,280
You've been busy all day.

236
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:58,590
Have a cup of tea and take a break.

237
00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:00,840
If you hadn't mentioned it,

238
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:01,840
I wouldn't have noticed.

239
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:02,790
But now that you say it,

240
00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:04,760
I do feel a bit tired.

241
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:10,640
Father,

242
00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:12,670
how's the locust situation?

243
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:15,790
That's not something
you should ask about.

244
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,280
Just asking.

245
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,790
You can't even ask.

246
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,880
Mr. Qin, he has arrived.

247
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:28,230
Let him in.

248
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:28,910
Yes.

249
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:30,230
A guest has come.

250
00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:32,030
Then I won't disturb you, Father.

251
00:13:43,470 --> 00:13:44,030
[Harmony and Grace Hall]
Miss Liu.

252
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:58,000
Mr. Liu, he has arrived.

253
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,320
I am Qin Yi.

254
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:04,320
Greetings, Mr. Liu.

255
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,960
Since it's Mr. Zhao who recommended him,

256
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:08,760
get him a seat.

257
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:09,520
Yes.

258
00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:12,910
Thank you, Mr. Liu.

259
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:21,470
Please.

260
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,910
You've put in so much effort

261
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,440
just to see me.

262
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:05,960
What's your aim?

263
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,000
Just say it.

264
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:12,790
I wouldn't dare deceive you, Mr. Liu.

265
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:16,030
I've stockpiled a large amount of grain.

266
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:21,710
For charity?

267
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:23,030
Good.

268
00:15:23,550 --> 00:15:24,550
So, do you want

269
00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:26,670
to donate it to the governor yamen

270
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:29,000
or to the county yamens?

271
00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:34,280
Mr. Liu, you're joking.

272
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:36,400
I'm a businessman.

273
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:37,670
I seek profit.

274
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:39,670
Profit.

275
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:45,550
What does your pursuit of profit
have to do with me?

276
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,440
If you

277
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:51,320
can delay the relief grain distribution

278
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:52,670
by one month,

279
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:55,030
I can sell my grain

280
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:56,230
at a high price.

281
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:57,470
I'll gladly give

282
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:58,960
eighty percent of the profits

283
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,400
to your yamen

284
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:01,710
for expenses.

285
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:04,000
How bold!

286
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:09,840
Do you know
that delaying relief grain by a month

287
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,880
will cause many victims to die?

288
00:16:12,590 --> 00:16:13,400
Just half a month.

289
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:15,520
Half a month is enough.

290
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:25,200
You've gone through all this trouble

291
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:28,110
just for a 20% profit?

292
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,230
Is it worth it?

293
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:35,110
Mr. Liu,

294
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:36,590
I'll speak frankly.

295
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:38,790
I've had dealings
with the Qi family for years.

296
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,790
Now, the cooperation
between the Qi and Qin families

297
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:42,150
has reached a dead end.

298
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:43,320
I'd like

299
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,520
to serve you.

300
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:50,470
The Qi family?

301
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:53,400
Which Qi family?

302
00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:56,320
I mean the Governor, Qi Zongyue.

303
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:03,000
Alright.

304
00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:06,520
Seems I underestimated you.

305
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:09,920
Get up.

306
00:17:11,350 --> 00:17:13,110
Tell me about your relationship
with the Qi family.

307
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,070
Okay.

308
00:17:16,430 --> 00:17:18,560
How's Fengzhou doing?

309
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,400
I visited him yesterday.

310
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,040
His health

311
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:25,430
is getting worse.

312
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:35,760
Given Fengzhou's health issues,

313
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:39,470
you should take on more responsibilities

314
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:41,520
for the family affairs from now on,

315
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:43,800
and slowly handle

316
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:45,590
the outside matters as well.

317
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:50,590
Yes, Father.

318
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,560
This past year,

319
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,430
the drought and locusts

320
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,430
made life unbearable.

321
00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:01,880
Tomorrow,
I'm heading north for a patrol mission.

322
00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:03,830
While I'm away,

323
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:07,230
keep a close eye

324
00:18:07,950 --> 00:18:09,950
on Liu and Zhao's families.

325
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,800
Alright, I've got it. Father.

326
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,110
Have you heard from Menglin?

327
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:22,160
That troublemaker...

328
00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:25,400
You know quite a bit

329
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:27,000
about the Qi family.

330
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,950
I'll tell you everything I know,
Mr. Liu.

331
00:18:35,310 --> 00:18:36,110
Someone!

332
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:39,430
Mr. Liu.

333
00:18:39,470 --> 00:18:40,800
The guest has been here a while,

334
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:41,830
and no tea has been served.

335
00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:43,640
You've got no sense of decorum!

336
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:44,710
Yes.

337
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,710
Thank you, Mr. Liu.

338
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:53,400
About the relief grain you mentioned,

339
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,110
I'll think it over.

340
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:58,800
After all,
coordinating grain distribution

341
00:18:58,830 --> 00:19:00,400
takes time.

342
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:01,710
You're wise, Mr. Liu.

343
00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:03,230
But,

344
00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:07,000
it's not easy for you to make money.

345
00:19:07,070 --> 00:19:09,000
You should keep more for yourself.

346
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,160
You see,

347
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,040
I don't have many people here.

348
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:13,920
It won't take much.

349
00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:16,190
Thanks for your understanding, Mr. Liu.

350
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:18,710
I'm very grateful.

351
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,310
I won't forget it.

352
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:25,000
Locusts...

353
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:27,920
It's a disaster,
but it's also an opportunity.

354
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,470
When the opportunity arises,
we must seize it.

355
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:32,280
So,

356
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:36,190
maybe you should do more

357
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:38,560
for the Qi family.

358
00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:43,350
Don't worry, Mr. Liu.

359
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:45,520
I won't let you down.

360
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:51,110
Serve the tea.

361
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,070
It's gone.

362
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,400
All gone!

363
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:19,950
No one's managing this?

364
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:22,310
Oh my God!

365
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:26,190
Open your eyes and see!

366
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:29,310
Look at our crops.

367
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:32,880
They're in such a terrible state!

368
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,880
My god!

369
00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:42,000
Look at our crops.

370
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:43,110
This is the most real aspect

371
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:44,470
of human life.

372
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:48,040
Look at how they've been ruined!

373
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:52,560
Your hands...

374
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,710
Compared to their suffering,

375
00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:01,160
my injuries are nothing.

376
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,400
Dabing, it's time to eat!

377
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:49,230
Why is it all just watery?

378
00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:51,400
Magistrate Han took all the grain

379
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,920
to exchange for locusts.

380
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:54,230
How can there be anything dry left?

381
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:56,310
In a couple of days,
we won't even have this watery stuff.

382
00:21:56,350 --> 00:21:58,040
I'll go call Magistrate Han, Mr. Chen,

383
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:59,470
and Mr. Qi to join us to eat.

384
00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:01,160
Mr. Cai.

385
00:22:01,590 --> 00:22:02,760
You've worked for ages.

386
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:03,590
You two eat first.

387
00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:04,680
I'll go get them.

388
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:05,800
Okay.

389
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,000
Mr. Qi,

390
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,190
thanks for your support.

391
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:14,070
No need to thank me.

392
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:16,280
I'm not doing this for you.

393
00:22:18,110 --> 00:22:20,070
I know, you're doing it for Luo Shu.

394
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:22,040
It's not just for her.

395
00:22:22,470 --> 00:22:23,880
It's for the people of Linfen too.

396
00:22:24,430 --> 00:22:25,230
To be honest,

397
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,110
when you were using military grain

398
00:22:27,110 --> 00:22:29,110
to encourage people
to exchange locusts for grain,

399
00:22:29,470 --> 00:22:31,000
that kind of courage and responsibility

400
00:22:31,430 --> 00:22:33,190
really makes me feel ashamed.

401
00:22:34,830 --> 00:22:35,640
I know.

402
00:22:37,310 --> 00:22:39,350
Misusing military grain
is a serious crime.

403
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:41,880
But when danger comes,
I will be ready to act.

404
00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:43,880
Not to mention the danger
Luo Shu was in at the time,

405
00:22:44,110 --> 00:22:45,110
the grain itself belongs

406
00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:46,680
to the farmers
who worked hard to grow it.

407
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:47,920
We're just returning what we've taken

408
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:48,830
from the people to serve them.

409
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:51,520
We can't let those

410
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,070
who toil in the fields starve.

411
00:22:55,470 --> 00:22:56,760
Your good intentions

412
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:58,310
are definitely not wrong.

413
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:00,590
But a nation has its laws,
and a family has its rules.

414
00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:02,520
If you don't follow these rules,

415
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:03,680
you'll

416
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,040
regret it later.

417
00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:06,350
Thanks for the reminder.

418
00:23:07,950 --> 00:23:09,470
But I am tough.

419
00:23:09,950 --> 00:23:11,920
I can handle any trouble
that comes my way.

420
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:12,920
What about Luo Shu?

421
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,950
Can you bear to let her get involved

422
00:23:14,950 --> 00:23:16,800
and suffer alongside you later?

423
00:23:17,430 --> 00:23:18,400
If you don't want that,

424
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:20,400
keep your distance from her.

425
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:23,470
I'm willing to suffer with him.

426
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:57,680
Um...

427
00:23:59,830 --> 00:24:01,800
Does what you just said

428
00:24:02,350 --> 00:24:03,430
still count?

429
00:24:04,430 --> 00:24:05,590
What?

430
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:07,800
Don't try to backtrack.

431
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:08,640
I clearly heard you say

432
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:09,680
you're willing to suffer with...

433
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:10,950
Don't bring that up again.

434
00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:13,280
That was just under pressure.

435
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:14,520
I didn't want to see you struggle,

436
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:15,920
so I went along with the act.

437
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:16,830
That doesn't count.

438
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:18,070
But I wasn't acting.

439
00:24:18,830 --> 00:24:19,640
Luo Shu,

440
00:24:19,950 --> 00:24:21,920
everything I said came from the heart.

441
00:24:22,430 --> 00:24:23,830
Since I'm in love with you,

442
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:27,110
I will never let you down.

443
00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:29,190
Anyway, I

444
00:24:29,190 --> 00:24:30,190
have made up my mind about you.

445
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:31,280
I'll marry no one

446
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:32,110
but you.

447
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:33,800
If you're willing,

448
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:34,710
I'll marry you properly,

449
00:24:34,710 --> 00:24:36,040
carrying you home
in a grand sedan chair.

450
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,470
I'll be your lifelong partner.

451
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:39,830
If you're not willing,

452
00:24:40,950 --> 00:24:41,880
I'll wait for you.

453
00:24:42,710 --> 00:24:43,830
I'll wait a lifetime if I must.

454
00:24:47,310 --> 00:24:48,110
Qi Menglin,

455
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:51,160
do you truly dare to marry me?

456
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:52,470
Yes.

457
00:24:55,430 --> 00:24:56,230
Alright.

458
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:00,920
If you do, I'll marry you.

459
00:25:02,590 --> 00:25:04,350
I'm looking forward
to your grand sedan chair.

460
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:07,560
Then I'll go

461
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:08,640
to resign from my post in Pingyangwei.

462
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:09,760
We'll go back to Taiyuan.

463
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:12,760

Qiao Si has arrived.

00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:31,190
Greetings, Mr. Qin.

530
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:41,310
I need you to do two things for me.

531
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:43,230
What do you need?

532
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:45,470
Spread the word

533
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:46,950
around Linfen's surrounding counties

534
00:30:46,950 --> 00:30:48,680
that Linfen has grain.

535
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:51,280
Arrange for people to go to Linfen

536
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:53,520
to get the local gentry

537
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:56,880
to ask Han Muzhi for grain.

538
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:58,190
Yes.

539
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:07,680
How's that thing going?

540
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,350
Everything's been done

541
00:31:09,350 --> 00:31:10,190
as you planned.

542
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:12,560
The person has passed away.

543
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:15,830
What a pity.

544
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:18,950
They should be back soon, right?

545
00:31:19,310 --> 00:31:20,920
Within the next couple of days.

546
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:24,160
They're returning just in time.

547
00:31:28,230 --> 00:31:30,590
Lian Shu, you go back and settle in.

548
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:35,080
[Taiyuan]

549
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:37,590
Please come in.

550
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:47,400
Are your windows secure?

551
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:49,000
Is there someone on duty at night?

552
00:31:52,430 --> 00:31:53,230
In this hot summer,

553
00:31:53,230 --> 00:31:54,350
how can you use a cotton blanket?

554
00:31:54,350 --> 00:31:55,160
It's suffocating,

555
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:56,280
not breathable at all.

556
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,310
Do you have any silk ones?

557
00:31:59,950 --> 00:32:01,070
Besides this,

558
00:32:01,070 --> 00:32:01,920
this blanket lining won't do.

559
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:02,880
It's too rough.

560
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:04,560
And what about the pillows?

561
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:07,350
Do you have any medicine pillows
for sleep?

562
00:32:08,070 --> 00:32:08,880
Young Master,

563
00:32:08,950 --> 00:32:09,760
our inn

564
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:11,070
has been running for five or six years.

565
00:32:11,070 --> 00:32:12,560
We've never had any issues.

566
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:13,190
Also,

567
00:32:13,190 --> 00:32:14,880
the valuable items you want

568
00:32:14,950 --> 00:32:16,070
are not something

569
00:32:16,070 --> 00:32:16,880
a regular inn has.

570
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:18,520
What kind of inn are you running?

571
00:32:20,590 --> 00:32:22,350
Come stay at Duoxi Garden with me.

572
00:32:22,350 --> 00:32:23,710
I'm very satisfied with this place.

573
00:32:24,350 --> 00:32:25,040
Could you please,

574
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:26,520
bring me some hot water?

575
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:27,680
Okay!

576
00:32:32,070 --> 00:32:33,470
Why did you stay here?

577
00:32:33,710 --> 00:32:34,710
Duoxi Garden is

578
00:32:34,710 --> 00:32:36,040
in the governor's house.

579
00:32:36,430 --> 00:32:37,470
And you didn't inform your family

580
00:32:37,470 --> 00:32:38,520
about our situation.

581
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:40,160
If I rashly go back with you,

582
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:41,520
won't that give people something
to gossip about?

583
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:42,640
And it's not proper.

584
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:43,710
But if you're here alone,

585
00:32:43,710 --> 00:32:44,920
I'll worried about you.

586
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:46,800
Didn't you say you'd help me uncover

587
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:48,520
the truth about the fire years ago?

588
00:32:48,710 --> 00:32:50,160
I have to stay here

589
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:51,350
to make something happen

590
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:52,920
and get closer to the truth.

591
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:54,400
We have to find out the truth for sure.

592
00:32:54,430 --> 00:32:56,070
But your safety can't be ignored.

593
00:32:56,950 --> 00:32:57,680
I absolutely can't

594
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:58,950
let you face danger alone.

595
00:33:00,190 --> 00:33:01,350
You used

596
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,350
to handle everything alone.

597
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:05,160
But now it's different.

598
00:33:05,470 --> 00:33:06,710
Our fates are tied together.

599
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:07,920
We share life and death.

600
00:33:08,470 --> 00:33:09,280
With me around,

601
00:33:09,830 --> 00:33:11,160
I will never let you

602
00:33:11,350 --> 00:33:12,470
be in danger.

603
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:14,190
I understand.

604
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,470
Young Master!

605
00:33:17,950 --> 00:33:18,760
Young Master!

606
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:21,680
Mr. Fengzhou

607
00:33:23,110 --> 00:33:23,920
has passed away.

608
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:31,830
Get out of the way!

609
00:33:32,350 --> 00:33:32,950
Mr. Menglin!

610
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:37,800
[Qi Mansion]

611
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:02,920
Fengzhou!

612
00:34:06,470 --> 00:34:07,190
Fengzhou!

613
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:13,150
Fengzhou!

614
00:34:18,870 --> 00:34:19,670
Menglin!

615
00:34:21,670 --> 00:34:23,190
Pull yourself together.

616
00:34:23,190 --> 00:34:24,910
It's not time to cry yet.

617
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:26,870
Yanjin.

618
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:38,040
Yanjin.

619
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:54,000
They say Fengzhou is too weak and sick

620
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,670
to perform,

621
00:34:57,190 --> 00:35:00,670
and that his wife
is cheating with the gardener.

622
00:35:00,670 --> 00:35:02,190
I can't believe it.

623
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:03,840
Even in this grand house,

624
00:35:03,910 --> 00:35:05,710
there are such dirty things.

625
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:09,390
You are easily surprised,

626
00:35:09,390 --> 00:35:10,520
easily surprised.

627
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:12,430
The young mistress of the Qi family

628
00:35:12,430 --> 00:35:14,150
and the gardener...

629
00:35:17,190 --> 00:35:18,430
Is that true?

630
00:35:18,430 --> 00:35:19,430
It is true.

631
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:20,430
You know,

632
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,520
Fengzhou has a fiery temper.

633
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:23,600
His illness

634
00:35:23,630 --> 00:35:25,320
can't handle sudden stress.

635
00:35:25,870 --> 00:35:27,280
Rumors can be deadlier than arrows.

636
00:35:27,710 --> 00:35:28,520
This arrow

637
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,320
was definitely aimed by someone.

638
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:31,800
What a dirty deal!

639
00:35:32,470 --> 00:35:33,280
Clearly,

640
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:36,080
someone has their eye on our Qi family.

641
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:38,430
By the way, Menglin,

642
00:35:39,230 --> 00:35:40,800
I hadn't even sent you the death notice,

643
00:35:41,190 --> 00:35:42,520
yet you had already returned to Taiyuan.

644
00:35:42,950 --> 00:35:44,230
What happened?

645
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:49,150
I came back with Luo Shu.

646
00:35:49,150 --> 00:35:49,870
Luo Shu?

647
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:52,430
Luo Shu, always Luo Shu.

648
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:54,630
Menglin,

649
00:35:55,710 --> 00:35:57,470
why are you so obsessed?

650
00:35:57,470 --> 00:35:58,150
Yanjin,

651
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:00,760
my relationship with Luo Shu

652
00:36:01,430 --> 00:36:02,870
is not the right time to discuss now.

653
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:04,120
But I still want an answer

654
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:05,150
from you.

655
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:06,870
Is the death of Luo Shu's parents

656
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:09,520
connected

657
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:10,670
to our Qi family?

658
00:36:11,470 --> 00:36:13,150
I'll tell you one last time.

659
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:16,150
This matter with the Luo family

660
00:36:17,230 --> 00:36:19,840
has nothing to do with our Qi family.

661
00:36:25,150 --> 00:36:26,470
Then it must be Qin Yi.

662
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:28,630
Yanjin,

663
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:31,600
you know him better than we do.

664
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:33,360
Do you think

665
00:36:33,710 --> 00:36:34,870
he could be behind this?

666
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:36,470
This time going to Linfen,

667
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,670
all the clues point to Qin Yi.

668
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:40,230
What's even more surprising is

669
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:41,840
that all these years,

670
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:44,040
Qin Yi has been secretly

671
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:45,150
controlling Luo Shu,

672
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:46,360
keeping her under house arrest

673
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,120
and preventing her
from redeeming herself.

674
00:36:50,190 --> 00:36:51,230
Now that you mention it,

675
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:53,150
you really nailed it.

676
00:36:53,910 --> 00:36:55,560
Father cut off Qin Yi's access
to wealth,

677
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:57,230
so he can't gain anything

678
00:36:57,230 --> 00:36:58,470
from our Qi family anymore.

679
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,520
He must hold a grudge against us.

680
00:37:03,470 --> 00:37:04,280
So you're saying

681
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:06,520
the rumors were spread by Qin Yi?

682
00:37:06,710 --> 00:37:08,280
It's possible.

683
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:11,000
This man can do

684
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,080
anything dirty.

685
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:13,670
He's shameless.

686
00:37:14,430 --> 00:37:15,230
Yanjin,

687
00:37:15,950 --> 00:37:16,800
why don't we send troops

688
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:17,800
and capture him?

689
00:37:17,870 --> 00:37:19,360
We'll settle all the scores at once.

690
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:21,910
Qin Yi is sneaky and cunning,

691
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:23,760
not something you can easily imagine.

692
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:25,080
Besides, we don't have

693
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:26,150
solid evidence.

694
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:28,280
Let's wait for Father to come back.

695
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:35,600
Yulan.

696
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,430
I brought you some food.

697
00:37:38,430 --> 00:37:39,840
How can I be turned away?

698
00:37:46,150 --> 00:37:47,800
You're watching me all the time

699
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:49,870
just to deliver food?

700
00:37:50,470 --> 00:37:51,280
Yulan.

701
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,840
You really hurt my feelings.

702
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:55,670
Is it wrong to be nice

703
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:57,000
to someone I like?

704
00:38:00,630 --> 00:38:01,320
Look,

705
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:02,800
I brought you something.

706
00:38:08,870 --> 00:38:10,080
Did you come back

707
00:38:10,710 --> 00:38:12,000
to marry

708
00:38:12,710 --> 00:38:14,040
Qi Menglin?

709
00:38:19,190 --> 00:38:20,630
I advise you not to.

710
00:38:21,710 --> 00:38:22,950
You'll regret it.

711
00:38:23,710 --> 00:38:25,950
The Qi family killed your father;

712
00:38:26,430 --> 00:38:27,430
you surely can't

713
00:38:27,670 --> 00:38:29,230
marry your enemy, can you?

714
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:31,080
Did the Qi family kill my parents,

715
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:32,870
or was it you?

716
00:38:33,430 --> 00:38:34,560
Of course it was the Qi family.

717
00:38:35,430 --> 00:38:36,600
How could Governor Qi

718
00:38:36,910 --> 00:38:37,670
be at odds with a minor official

719
00:38:37,670 --> 00:38:39,230
from the granary?

720
00:38:39,230 --> 00:38:41,080
He wasn't the governor back then.

721
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:42,080
When I investigated

722
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:43,360
the cause of my parents' death,

723
00:38:43,670 --> 00:38:45,630
you were the one guiding me

724
00:38:45,670 --> 00:38:47,000
and giving me clues.

725
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,150
You put those so-called pieces
of evidence

726
00:38:48,150 --> 00:38:48,910
in front of me.

727
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:49,800
Wasn't that to help you?

728
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:50,910
What nonsense!

729
00:38:51,870 --> 00:38:53,430
If you hadn't personally experienced it

730
00:38:53,430 --> 00:38:54,520
and done it yourself,

731
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:56,390
how would you know so much?

732
00:38:57,710 --> 00:38:59,520
Yes, I experienced it back then,

733
00:38:59,870 --> 00:39:01,120
but think about it.

734
00:39:01,150 --> 00:39:02,430
How old was I then?

735
00:39:02,870 --> 00:39:04,040
A fourteen-year-old kid

736
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:05,910
could only be a follower,

737
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:07,520
running errands for Mr. Qin.

738
00:39:07,910 --> 00:39:09,120
When the incident happened,

739
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:10,320
what could I do but watch?

740
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:11,760
So you admit

741
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:12,950
the Qin family was involved?

742
00:39:14,190 --> 00:39:15,000
Yulan,

743
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:16,470
you're smart enough

744
00:39:16,470 --> 00:39:17,670
to see through this, right?

745
00:39:17,870 --> 00:39:18,630
In front of the Qi family,

746
00:39:18,630 --> 00:39:20,230
the Qin family has no choice
but to obey.

747
00:39:20,670 --> 00:39:21,950
All along, it's been the Qi family

748
00:39:21,950 --> 00:39:22,910
that wanted to kill your father.

749
00:39:23,150 --> 00:39:23,800
I've made that clear to you

750
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:25,150
a long time ago.

751
00:39:25,150 --> 00:39:26,150
You just don't want to accept

752
00:39:26,150 --> 00:39:27,000
this fact.

753
00:39:27,390 --> 00:39:28,870
You've investigated for so long.

754
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:30,630
What was Qi Yanjin doing?

755
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,230
Why did Xu Biao suddenly die?

756
00:39:32,230 --> 00:39:33,670
Don't you find that strange?

757
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:34,950
I just didn't want you

758
00:39:34,950 --> 00:39:36,560
to be kept in the dark.

759
00:39:39,430 --> 00:39:40,230
Yulan,

760
00:39:43,470 --> 00:39:44,600
don't you want to know

761
00:39:44,870 --> 00:39:46,760
what really happened back then?

762
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:48,630
I'll tell you right now.

763
00:39:49,630 --> 00:39:52,040
That day, I saw with my own eyes

764
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:53,840
the Qi family's servants

765
00:39:54,190 --> 00:39:56,470
spreading petroleum all over the yard.

766
00:39:56,950 --> 00:39:58,600
In the end, they threw a torch

767
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,320
and burned your parents alive.

768
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:04,470
After that, I felt pity

769
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:06,630
and knelt down,

770
00:40:06,630 --> 00:40:08,080
begging them to spare your life.

771
00:40:09,670 --> 00:40:11,470
I saved your life.

772
00:40:11,870 --> 00:40:12,670
But I can't

773
00:40:12,670 --> 00:40:14,320
take you back
to the Qin family right away.

774
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:16,360
I'm afraid your identity
will be exposed.

775
00:40:16,670 --> 00:40:17,320
Mr. Qin

776
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:18,760
would never accept you.

777
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:19,600
I have no choice.

778
00:40:20,150 --> 00:40:21,320
I can only let you

779
00:40:21,470 --> 00:40:23,000
stay temporarily at your neighbor's.

780
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:25,120
Later, I pretended

781
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:26,080
to buy you over

782
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:29,430
and only then dared to bring you
into the Qin family.

783
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:31,870
Why do you all

784
00:40:31,870 --> 00:40:33,360
want to kill my father?

785
00:40:35,870 --> 00:40:36,910
It didn't include me.

786
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:38,950
It was them.

787
00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:40,190
You can

788
00:40:40,190 --> 00:40:41,710
ask Qi Menglin about this.

789
00:40:41,870 --> 00:40:42,670
Let him ask his father

790
00:40:42,670 --> 00:40:43,710
and his elder brother

791
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:45,840
why they wanted to wipe you out.

792
00:40:47,910 --> 00:40:48,710
No, wait.

793
00:40:52,670 --> 00:40:53,670
You probably won't have a chance

794
00:40:53,670 --> 00:40:54,950
to see Qi Menglin again.

795
00:40:55,670 --> 00:40:57,560
As a low-born performer

796
00:40:58,870 --> 00:41:00,760
or the daughter of the minor official,
Luo Qingfeng,

797
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:02,000
you wouldn't be accepted

798
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,560
by the Qi family.

799
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:05,000
They would never allow Qi Menglin

800
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:07,230
to marry you.

801
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,080
What can you do?

802
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:11,840
Yulan,

803
00:41:13,150 --> 00:41:14,390
I'm the only one in this world

804
00:41:14,390 --> 00:41:15,430
who loves you the most.

805
00:41:16,230 --> 00:41:17,840
I genuinely want to marry you.

806
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:20,630
Do you remember?

807
00:41:22,390 --> 00:41:24,000
As soon as I became the master
of the Qin family,

808
00:41:24,470 --> 00:41:25,520
I came to find you

809
00:41:25,710 --> 00:41:27,000
to buy your freedom.

810
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:28,560
You were still young then,

811
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:29,280
but that's okay.

812
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:30,280
I could wait for you,

813
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:31,360
slowly nurture you

814
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:32,950
to become the mistress
of the Qin family.

815
00:41:33,630 --> 00:41:34,430
But what about you?

816
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:35,950
You rejected me.

817
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:38,190
I didn't want to force you,

818
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:39,670
so I let you

819
00:41:39,670 --> 00:41:41,190
stay in Mingke House,

820
00:41:41,670 --> 00:41:42,950
waiting for you to change your mind.

821
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:44,080
Think about it.

822
00:41:45,190 --> 00:41:46,280
Weren't you living

823
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:48,150
a life of luxury in Mingke House?

824
00:41:48,190 --> 00:41:49,150
Who made it hard for you?

825
00:41:49,150 --> 00:41:50,320
Who bullied you?

826
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:51,840
Think again.

827
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:53,360
Which girl in Mingke House

828
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:55,000
is still not deflowered at eighteen?

829
00:41:55,190 --> 00:41:56,430
I did so much for you,

830
00:41:57,470 --> 00:41:59,040
and you just ignore it?

831
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:00,360
But you killed Wuniang

832
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:01,320
and Jin Miaocui.

833
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:04,870
Wuniang.

834
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:07,870
Wuniang.

835
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:09,950
She deserved it.

836
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:12,040
If it weren't for

837
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:13,520
her raising you for so many years,

838
00:42:13,870 --> 00:42:15,280
I would have made her suffer more.

839
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:18,150
As for the girl named Jin,

840
00:42:19,470 --> 00:42:20,950
it's indeed a pity.

841
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:23,520
I'm sorry, Yulan.

842
00:42:24,670 --> 00:42:25,670
But she knew

843
00:42:25,670 --> 00:42:27,000
a secret she shouldn't know.

844
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:28,870
I can't let her

845
00:42:28,870 --> 00:42:29,950
tip you off

846
00:42:29,950 --> 00:42:31,150
and stir up trouble.

847
00:42:31,950 --> 00:42:32,630
I can't let her

848
00:42:32,630 --> 00:42:33,710
speak ill

849
00:42:33,710 --> 00:42:34,390
and tarnish

850
00:42:34,390 --> 00:42:36,280
my pure and beautiful image

851
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:38,120
in your heart.

852
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:40,150
Only the dead

853
00:42:40,150 --> 00:42:41,600
will stay quiet forever.

854
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:43,360
Yulan,

855
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:46,280
my whole heart

856
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:48,470
is with you.

857
00:42:48,470 --> 00:42:49,600
But she's my only family

858
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:50,800
in this world.

859
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:52,950
She means nothing.
