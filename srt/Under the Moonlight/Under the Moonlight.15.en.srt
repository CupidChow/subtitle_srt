[Episode 15]

4
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:34,800
Bai Yue is dead.

5
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:36,160
Really?

6
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:37,440
How did he die?

7
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,630
He must have been killed.

8
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:41,360
Found in a pit.

9
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:44,590
This is bad.

10
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:46,310
Very bad.

11
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:47,480
What will happen

12
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:47,950
if they find out tomorrow?

13
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:48,510
Qian Dayou

14
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:49,910
will definitely not let it go.

15
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:51,760
It should take some time to find out.

16
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:52,830
Why?

17
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:54,760
That's an abandoned pit.

18
00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:55,510
Before I left,

19
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:57,160
I cleaned up all the blood.

20
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:02,480
Bai Yue...

21
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:04,480
Did he do something to you?

22
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:05,480
Does it hurt?

23
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,870
No, how did Bai Yue die?

24
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:07,440
Tell me.

25
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,360
Tell me everything.

26
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:09,320
I'm standing here

27
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,670
just fine, aren't I?

28
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:12,240
Bai Yue is dead.

29
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,720
We must be safer now.

30
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:15,000
Don't be anxious.

31
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,390
Let me explain slowly.

32
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:19,110
Does Mr. Chen know about this?

33
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,550
How did this bed get broken?

34
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:36,240
Dayou,

35
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:37,720
Qian Yue is missing.

36
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,720
When did this happen?

37
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,800
He didn't come back to sleep last night.

38
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:52,360
Hurry and find him.

39
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:53,470
If the authorities find out,

40
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:54,360
it will be a problem.

41
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:55,720
Yes.

42
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:02,080
Mr. Qian, Mr. Chen wants to see you.

43
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:03,320
He wants to see me?

44
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,390
Today, I'm treating.

45
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:10,110
I've troubled you to take care of it.

46
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:11,270
I feel

47
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:12,830
very guilty about this.

48
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,390
No, Mr. Chen.

49
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:19,110
It's my pleasure.

50
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:23,160
Mr. Qian, cheers.

51
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:24,800
Cheers, Mr. Chen.

52
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:33,080
Mr. Qian,

53
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:35,360
the liquor from Xinghua Village
is quite strong.

54
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:36,470
Refreshing.

55
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,110
Mr. Chen,

56
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,600
if you like it,

57
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:42,470
there's plenty more.

58
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:46,910
Leave us alone.

59
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:48,270
Alright.

60
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:50,440
Mr. Qian,

61
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:53,550
the situation right now isn't very good.

62
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:59,520
I don't quite understand your meaning.

63
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:08,440
Read this letter.

64
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:15,960
It's clearly written in black and white.

65
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:17,480
It says you colluded with the White Ants

66
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:19,160
to traffic in women.

67
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,480
This is slander.

68
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,670
I never did that!

69
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:36,760
Whether you did or not,
don't rush to defend yourself.

70
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:39,160
As the saying goes,
"There's no smoke without fire."

71
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:40,000
To be honest,

72
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:40,760
this letter

73
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,950
was sent to the yamen

74
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:44,350
by one of your men.

75
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,950
That's impossible!

76
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:47,670
What's impossible about it?

77
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:50,390
Eunuch Zhang is using his position
for personal gain,

78
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:51,480
lining his own pockets.

79
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,390
Even if you

80
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:54,270
haven't heard a thing,

81
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:56,040
you should know

82
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,110
what's going on

83
00:04:57,110 --> 00:04:58,600
with the accounts from this mine.

84
00:04:58,790 --> 00:04:59,600
Think about it.

85
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:00,480
Since I can

86
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,920
come and check your accounts openly,

87
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,000
can Eunuch Zhang keep his position

88
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,320
as the mine supervisor?

89
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:13,550
Once Eunuch Zhang falls,

90
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:15,270
what will happen

91
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:17,070
to those who follow him?

92
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,480
I don't have to tell you that, right?

93
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:20,270
I don't believe it.

94
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,200
Eunuch Zhang

95
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,440
is not someone who can just fall.

96
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:26,390
You really are loyal

97
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:27,440
to Eunuch Zhang.

98
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,480
But you can't be sure

99
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,920
that one of your guilty associates

100
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:33,640
wouldn't report you to the authorities

101
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:35,670
in order to atone for his wrongdoings.

102
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:39,160
If someone really did that,

103
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:41,000
would you still need to find evidence

104
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:41,760
in this mine?

105
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,830
Who said I was here to find evidence?

106
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:44,790
I'm here

107
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:49,000
just to give you an opportunity.

108
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:52,160
Compared to those wanted bandits,

109
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,350
you are certainly more valuable.

110
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:55,350
Me?

111
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,200
I don't quite understand.

112
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,320
What value do I have?

113
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,880
Those who know the times are wise.

114
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,790
There are more supporters in this world

115
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:07,200
than just Eunuch Zhang.

116
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:17,040
Do you think

117
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,880
Mr. Han is clearing out the White Ants

118
00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:21,270
for the people's sake?
Don't be ridiculous.

119
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:23,510
It's just to make his achievements
look good.

120
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,920
Now that the prime culprits are caught,

121
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:25,830
and he gets the credit,

122
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:28,110
he won't care who the accomplices are.

123
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,950
To arrest you for a few women,

124
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:31,270
is that really necessary?

125
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:33,320
Then why did you bring these men...?

126
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,880
What's the point of being an official?

127
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:42,950
To gain something tangible.

128
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,230
If you're willing
to give Eunuch Zhang something,

129
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:47,270
why not give it to us?

130
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:48,670
We are scholars.

131
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:49,830
We have much more integrity

132
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:51,440
than a eunuch.

133
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:04,350
You scared me to death.

134
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:10,270
You should have said that earlier!

135
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:14,200
I told you when you arrived

136
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:17,110
that I am an understanding man,

137
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:19,160
so you can tell me

138
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,350
what you want.

139
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,160
This is not something

140
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,390
that can be openly discussed.

141
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:29,950
Here's the deal.

142
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,920
Mr. Qian, think it over.

143
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:34,110
You can't play both sides.

144
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:42,920
Mr. Han truly wants to protect me?

145
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,760
As long as you cooperate sincerely.

146
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:49,160
If you report Eunuch Zhang,

147
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:51,040
Mr. Han is even willing

148
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:53,920
to ask Mr. Liu, his future father-in-law

149
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:56,480
to petition the court for your merit.

150
00:07:58,830 --> 00:07:59,640
But

151
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,880
my fiancée was truly

152
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:04,880
taken away

153
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:05,670
by your man.

154
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:07,830
You must help me resolve this.

155
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:10,350
Return her to me safe and sound.

156
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:11,510
I care only about her.

157
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:12,760
I don't care if other women

158
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:13,550
live or die.

159
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:16,790
Her safety is your safety.

160
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:17,670
Otherwise, don't blame me

161
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:19,200
for disregarding your usefulness.

162
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,230
Just for harboring a fugitive,

163
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:23,000
I could have your mine

164
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,200
completely investigated.

165
00:08:37,230 --> 00:08:38,030
Close the door!

166
00:08:43,550 --> 00:08:44,350
Tell me,

167
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:46,910
that fool Qian Yue,

168
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:48,150
can't he be found?

169
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:49,280
No.

170
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,320
I think he might have run away.

171
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:53,320
I...

172
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:55,110
I get angry just seeing you.

173
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:00,670
Listen,

174
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,790
I took him in,

175
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,840
and he betrayed me.

176
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,280
I feel disappointed!

177
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,000
Keep looking.

178
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:14,320
He kidnapped
the deputy magistrate's fiancée.

179
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:14,840
With a woman,

180
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:15,910
where can he run?

181
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:18,080
He must be hiding

182
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,640
somewhere.

183
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,000
It's him!

184
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:21,910
He kidnapped
the deputy magistrate's woman

185
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:23,000
and framed us.

186
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:24,590
He's truly a piece of work.

187
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:28,280
Dayou,

188
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:30,030
are you really going
to rely on the authorities?

189
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:30,790
Fool!

190
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:33,200
I've told you so many times.

191
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:36,320
Don't loose the falcon
until you see the hare.

192
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:38,080
It depends on Eunuch Zhang's situation

193
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,110
to decide.

194
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:41,030
I usually tell you to read more,

195
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:42,880
and who listens to me?

196
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:45,710
You, tell me,

197
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:47,840
have the women Eunuch Zhang wanted

198
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,080
been secured yet?

199
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:50,960
Almost there!

200
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:51,790
Useless!

201
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,000
You can't even find a few women.

202
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:54,960
What can you do?

203
00:09:57,110 --> 00:09:58,590
I'm talking about them, not you?

204
00:09:58,590 --> 00:09:59,840
Don't pretend you can't hear me.

205
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:01,840
You three,

206
00:10:02,590 --> 00:10:03,840
remember this.

207
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,000
If the women Eunuch Zhang wanted

208
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:06,880
are not secured,

209
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:07,440
you three

210
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,760
will all go mine coal.

211
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:10,760
Get lost!

212
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:28,440
Gou, what do you think?

213
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:29,670
Let me tell you,

214
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:30,880
if it weren't for Dayou pushing me,

215
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,080
I would have kept her for myself.

216
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:33,440
Well,

217
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:34,670
you can rest assured.

218
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:36,110
I'll speak well of you
in front of Dayou.

219
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:37,000
Thank you, Gou.

220
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:41,320
Take care.

221
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:49,230
Dayou,

222
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:50,710
I've brought the woman to you.

223
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,710
She's as beautiful as a fairy
and fiery as a flame.

224
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:54,520
Eunuch Zhang will definitely like her.

225
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:55,910
Already?

226
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:57,470
Where did you get her?

227
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:59,320
I just bought her from a middleman.

228
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,000
It wasn't easy.

229
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:01,470
Let me tell you,

230
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:02,640
this woman is truly one in a hundred,

231
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,320
no, one in ten thousand.

232
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:06,470
Where is she?

233
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,470
We can't draw attention during the day.

234
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:09,440
She's locked up in the pit.

235
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,400
Well done.

236
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:12,150
Eunuch Zhang has sent someone here.

237
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:13,960
What did I say?

238
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:15,470
Is the hat straight?

239
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:16,550
Yes, it is.

240
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:17,640
Let's go.

241
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,150
Eunuch Huang,

242
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,280
you could've sent a message.

243
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:28,520
I didn't expect you to come in person.

244
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:29,470
I came in person

245
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:31,440
for a reason.

246
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:34,230
Please.

247
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,520
Have some tea.

248
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:49,080
You said
they came to check the accounts.

249
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:51,030
The books have been handed over?

250
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,350
How could that be?

251
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:55,790
I've created a pile of fake accounts.

252
00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:57,000
Let them check.

253
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:58,670
Good.

254
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,030
Very good.

255
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:01,910
I came this time

256
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:02,640
because of the instructions

257
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,590
from my godfather.

258
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:05,960
I'm here
to settle the accounts with you.

259
00:12:06,590 --> 00:12:07,280
You should bring

260
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,790
this year's account books

261
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:10,350
and check them with me.

262
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:13,150
If there are no issues,
they can be destroyed.

263
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:14,760
Settle the accounts?

264
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:17,150
Isn't it a bit early for that?

265
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,400
It's usually in the twelfth month.

266
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:19,320
My godfather has his reasons

267
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,910
for doing this.

268
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,280
Do I really need to explain to you?

269
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,080
No.

270
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:28,000
I'll have someone prepare it right away.

271
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:30,550
That's very good.

272
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:34,440
Have some tea.

273
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:40,110
Is there anything else

274
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:42,760
from Eunuch Zhang for me?

275
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:44,200
Any other instructions?

276
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:51,110
What other instructions could there be?

277
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,590
He said you were too impatient.

278
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,670
A deputy magistrate came,

279
00:12:55,670 --> 00:12:56,880
and you got scared.

280
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,520
You thought the sky was falling.

281
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,400
With your little courage,

282
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:02,350
what can my godfather trust you with

283
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:04,200
in the future?

284
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,400
It's because

285
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,520
I'm afraid of saying or doing

286
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:09,230
something wrong,

287
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:10,230
causing trouble

288
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:10,910
for Eunuch Zhang.

289
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:12,110
Enough.

290
00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:13,910
What happened in the past

291
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,590
is how it is now.

292
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:17,200
Be braver.

293
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,030
At most, you can just drive him away.

294
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,110
He won't leave.

295
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:24,640
Think of a way to make him leave.

296
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:26,150
You have

297
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:27,000
plenty of strong men

298
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,640
in your mine, right?

299
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,150
Can't they

300
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:31,350
get rid of those few

301
00:13:31,590 --> 00:13:32,760
from the yamen?

302
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,760
Let me tell you today,

303
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:41,200
as long as you don't kill
the deputy magistrate,

304
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:44,150
even if a few lives are lost,

305
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:46,880
my godfather can still protect you.

306
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:49,230
Good.

307
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:53,000
In that case,

308
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:54,230
I feel reassured.

309
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:00,880
It's been a while

310
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,440
since I've seen Eunuch Zhang.

311
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:05,910
I wonder if he is well.

312
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:08,590
He's in good health.

313
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:14,640
But how is he otherwise?

314
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,670
What do you mean by that?

315
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,110
I mean nothing much.

316
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:24,350
It's just that I heard some rumors

317
00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:25,710
in the yamen.

318
00:14:25,710 --> 00:14:27,280
They say
the Emperor is going to crack down...

319
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,110
Fool!

320
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:33,640
You believe such nonsense?

321
00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:36,880
I was stupid.

322
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,280
I shouldn't have said that.

323
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,520
Please don't be angry, Eunuch Huang.

324
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:41,520
I was scared

325
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:42,320
by the deputy magistrate.

326
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,280
He said things

327
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:45,030
that troubled me.

328
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:48,150
But now that you have arrived,

329
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:49,590
I feel reassured.

330
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:55,030
Rest assured,

331
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,400
my godfather will live forever.

332
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:58,440
Exactly!

333
00:14:59,350 --> 00:15:01,470
Eunuch Zhang must live forever.

334
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:04,200
Now that you're here,

335
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:06,030
do you want to take her with you?

336
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:07,790
No, I don't.

337
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:09,840
What you found

338
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:10,640
is just

339
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:12,000
a bunch of low-quality girls.

340
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,790
Nothing worth my godfather's attention.

341
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:15,000
Just get rid of her.

342
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:16,440
Eunuch Huang,

343
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:17,200
you know what?

344
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,790
This one is the best of the best.

345
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:20,710
She has a fierce temper!

346
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:21,790
I said no.

347
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:22,550
Why are you...

348
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:27,880
Alright then.

349
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:30,150
Let's go check her first.

350
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:32,670
Please, Eunuch Huang.

351
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,840
I just don't like coming to your pit.

352
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,200
It's filthy here.

353
00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:46,400
Which one is she?

354
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:47,150
Over here, Eunuch Huang.

355
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:48,400
This one.

356
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:10,400
Mr. Wang,

357
00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:12,760
where are you going at this hour?

358
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:16,840
No more pretending?

359
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:19,790
You are spies from the yamen.

360
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:20,880
I've known for a while.

361
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:21,960
In this case,

362
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:23,840
why don't you release her?

363
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:24,880
Release her?

364
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,470
Stop dreaming.

365
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:28,080
The corrupt officials are heartless,

366
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,230
why should I be righteous?

367
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,470
We've torn off the mask.

368
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,670
Then it's all or nothing.

369
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,710
If we go down, we'll take you with us.

370
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,520
Wouldn't that benefit Qian Dayou?

371
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:39,440
When I helped you infiltrate the mine,

372
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,670
it was to facilitate your actions.

373
00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:44,000
It was so you could

374
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:45,710
take down Qian Dayou's den.

375
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:47,840
I was stupid,

376
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,470
believing the yamen officers

377
00:16:49,470 --> 00:16:51,320
would seek justice and eliminate harm.

378
00:16:56,670 --> 00:16:57,440
So it was you

379
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,000
who sent the secret letter to the yamen.

380
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:01,760
And you were the one
who saved me that night.

381
00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:04,110
You tried to draw the officials

382
00:17:04,110 --> 00:17:05,590
to investigate Qian Dayou.

383
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:06,430
But why now

384
00:17:06,430 --> 00:17:07,640
are you turning against us?

385
00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:11,590
You are in cahoots with Qian Dayou.

386
00:17:11,590 --> 00:17:12,950
You are not here to handle the case.

387
00:17:12,950 --> 00:17:14,040
We infiltrated the mine

388
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:15,160
to investigate

389
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,190
Qian Dayou's kidnapping of women,

390
00:17:16,190 --> 00:17:18,350
colluding with the mine supervisor
to trade people.

391
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:19,470
Mr. Chen and the others came

392
00:17:19,470 --> 00:17:20,230
for the same reason.

393
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:20,950
Nonsense!

394
00:17:21,070 --> 00:17:22,830
Mr. Chen and Qian Dayou

395
00:17:22,830 --> 00:17:24,520
are just discussing
how to split the money,

396
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:25,760
and how to cover things up.

397
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:26,920
Since he only cares

398
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:27,950
about his own woman

399
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,760
and ignores the lives of other women,

400
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,430
I'll let him experience

401
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:32,560
the pain of losing her.

402
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:33,310
Wait a moment.

403
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:34,520
You misunderstood.

404
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:36,520
Mr. Chen is deceiving Qian Dayou.

405
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:37,280
It's to extract

406
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,950
evidence of his collusion
with Eunuch Zhang.

407
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:42,800
Don't move!

408
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,070
If you move again, I'll stab you.

409
00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:47,230
You two liars,

410
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:48,590
spouting nonsense.

411
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:50,190
Why should I believe you?

412
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:57,520
Mr. Wang,

413
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,520
calm down and think.

414
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:02,640
If we weren't

415
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,000
sincerely investigating,

416
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:05,230
why would we

417
00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:06,640
disguise ourselves and hide here?

418
00:18:07,430 --> 00:18:08,160
If Mr. Chen

419
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,070
was truly in cahoots with Qian Dayou,

420
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:11,590
why would Qian Dayou

421
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:13,110
send someone to watch him?

422
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:14,680
Think again.

423
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:16,230
Since we know

424
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:17,760
who is in this bag,

425
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,000
Mr. Chen must know too.

426
00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:21,230
If his concern

427
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:22,520
was only for his fiancée,

428
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:25,000
why wouldn't he
bring soldiers to save her?

429
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:27,350
He'd rather let his fiancée

430
00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:28,950
be in danger

431
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:29,880
than alert Qian Dayou,

432
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:31,400
in order to gather more evidence

433
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,920
and take down all the villains.

434
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:35,520
Mr. Wang,

435
00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:37,680
Zao Hua is innocent.

436
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,190
If you hand her over to Qian Dayou,

437
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:42,190
what's the difference

438
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:44,950
between you and them?

439
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,110
Do you know

440
00:18:48,110 --> 00:18:49,230
why Qian Yue hates me so deeply?

441
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:52,110
It's because I once used myself as bait

442
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:54,470
to help the authorities
crack the incense hall case,

443
00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:56,280
turning him into a fugitive.

444
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:58,640
If you hadn't saved me that day,

445
00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:01,190
I would have died at his hands.

446
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,000
Mr. Wang,

447
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:04,560
we're not doing this

448
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:06,830
to team up with evil,

449
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:09,070
but to uphold righteousness.

450
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:30,190
Zao Hua,

451
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:32,800
I owe you an apology.

452
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:33,830
I've caused you suffering.

453
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:35,110
I deserve to die.

454
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:39,880
What should we do about this?

455
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:41,710
You can punish me however you want.

456
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,070
You can send me to the authorities,

457
00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:44,310
I won't say a word.

458
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,230
The officials are right here.

459
00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:47,710
I don't even need to report you.

460
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,040
I want you to help them,

461
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:53,430
and also Mei,

462
00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:54,070
to capture

463
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:55,280
Qian Dayou and his gang.

464
00:19:58,190 --> 00:19:59,710
You're truly remarkable, Zao Hua.

465
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:01,520
No wonder you're Mr. Chen's fiancée.

466
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:03,520
Mr. Wang,

467
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:04,880
will you do it or not?

468
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:06,110
Yes, I will.

469
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:07,350
As long as we can get rid

470
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:08,680
of Qian Dayou and his gang of bandits,

471
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:09,880
I'll do anything.

472
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:11,190
Alright.

473
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:13,680
What should we do next?

474
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:16,470
Zao Hua,

475
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,040
go inform Mr. Chen

476
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:19,070
to gather people

477
00:20:19,070 --> 00:20:19,950
and get ready to move.

478
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:20,800
Okay.

479
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,470
No, Zao Hua

480
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:23,830
is not familiar with the mine.

481
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:25,000
She can't go alone.

482
00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:26,040
How about this?

483
00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:28,430
I'll have Doumiao guide her.

484
00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:30,880
Mr. Wang,

485
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,400
you and Mr. Qi

486
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,800
follow the clues I left

487
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:34,560
to find

488
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:35,880
the location of the hidden women.

489
00:20:36,590 --> 00:20:37,760
How did you leave clues?

490
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:41,640
I'll take Zao Hua's place.

491
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:43,880
No way.

492
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:44,710
No.

493
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:45,800
I don't agree. You can't.

494
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:46,560
No way.

495
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:47,760
You can't go in my place.

496
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:50,160
Listen to me.

497
00:20:51,230 --> 00:20:52,950
After Mr. Wang offers me to Qian Sigou,

498
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:54,560
Qian Sigou will definitely take me

499
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:55,830
to where the women are held.

500
00:20:56,110 --> 00:20:57,640
Along the way,
I'll be dropping blighted grains.

501
00:20:58,110 --> 00:20:59,800
You can follow the clues I leave

502
00:21:00,110 --> 00:21:01,760
to find out where they are kept.

503
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,590
When Mr. Chen arrives,

504
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:04,760
you all meet up

505
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:06,000
and come to rescue us.

506
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,430
As long as we find the kidnapped women,

507
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:09,880
that'll be proof,

508
00:21:10,190 --> 00:21:11,430
and we can pry the truth out
of Qian Dayou.

509
00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:13,520
As long as he confesses,

510
00:21:13,710 --> 00:21:15,400
Eunuch Zhang will have nowhere to run.

511
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:18,110
That's a good idea.

512
00:21:24,430 --> 00:21:26,160
No, it's too dangerous.

513
00:21:26,310 --> 00:21:27,560
What do you suggest?

514
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,470
I won't let you take this risk alone.

515
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,400
But if we don't send someone,

516
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,880
it'll be all for nothing.

517
00:21:34,950 --> 00:21:35,520
Are you really

518
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:36,950
going to send Zao Hua?

519
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:39,350
Let me go.

520
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:42,070
You're a man; how can you go?

521
00:21:42,350 --> 00:21:44,160
Qian Sigou isn't stupid.

522
00:21:44,190 --> 00:21:45,880
He'll definitely check.

523
00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:48,110
There's no way for us
to slip through this time.

524
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:50,430
Actually, there's no

525
00:21:50,430 --> 00:21:51,520
real danger.

526
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:53,640
You and Mr. Wang will follow us closely,

527
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:55,230
and Mr. Chen will arrive soon.

528
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:57,800
I'll get this credit for free.

529
00:21:59,350 --> 00:22:00,400
I trust you.

530
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,160
You'll keep me safe.

531
00:22:04,710 --> 00:22:06,560
Look, she's a real gem.

532
00:22:06,710 --> 00:22:07,430
Dayou

533
00:22:07,430 --> 00:22:08,280
spent a lot

534
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:08,800
of money

535
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:09,950
and I put in a ton of effort

536
00:22:09,950 --> 00:22:11,680
to get her.

537
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:13,430
Check her out.

538
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:26,590
Eunuch Huang,

539
00:22:27,470 --> 00:22:29,040
do you think Eunuch Zhang

540
00:22:29,430 --> 00:22:30,710
will be satisfied?

541
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,430
Satisfied? Nonsense.

542
00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:34,000
She's half dead.

543
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:39,070
Hurry.

544
00:22:42,950 --> 00:22:44,040
Qian Dayou,

545
00:22:44,190 --> 00:22:45,830
how dare you bring a woman like this

546
00:22:45,830 --> 00:22:46,760
to my godfather?

547
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,950
Are you trying to harm him?

548
00:22:49,230 --> 00:22:50,520
Isn't that the type he likes?

549
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:51,350
Shut up.

550
00:22:52,950 --> 00:22:54,430
Kill her.

551
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:55,640
Quick, kill her.

552
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:56,310
No.

553
00:22:56,710 --> 00:22:57,470
Get rid

554
00:22:57,470 --> 00:22:58,710
of these women,

555
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:00,000
with no one behind.

556
00:23:00,110 --> 00:23:00,830
But, Eunuch Huang...

557
00:23:00,830 --> 00:23:01,830
We haven't even...

558
00:23:01,830 --> 00:23:03,110
It's such a pity, Eunuch Zhang.

559
00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:04,070
Stop talking nonsense.

560
00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:05,000
Listen to Eunuch Huang.

561
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,640
Yes.

562
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:07,430
Dayou.

563
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:08,400
Dayou!

564
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:09,560
What are you shouting for?

565
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:11,040
What are you shouting for?
Someone's dead?

566
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:12,590
Someone's dead!

567
00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:15,110
Qian Yue is dead.

568
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:17,040
Who died?

569
00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:18,590
Qian Yue.

570
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:20,230
Qian Yue is dead?

571
00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:23,110
Wasn't he the one who sold me out?

572
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:24,920
What about Mr. Chen's wife?

573
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:26,160
Where's Mr. Chen's wife?

574
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:27,590
I don't know.

575
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:29,160
I am Mr. Chen's wife.

576
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:31,590
If you dare kill me,

577
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:33,310
just wait for him to come for revenge.

578
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:37,880
You...

579
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,350
That's impossible.

580
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,070
You've only been here a few days.

581
00:23:41,190 --> 00:23:41,920
I've been here

582
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,280
for quite a while already.

583
00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:44,470
You can ask him if you don't believe me.

584
00:23:46,710 --> 00:23:48,590
Dayou, I don't know!

585
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:49,950
Qian Dayou,

586
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:53,070
how dare you kidnap Mr. Chen's wife

587
00:23:53,430 --> 00:23:56,230
and try to trick me
into sending her to my godfather?

588
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,830
What are you up to?

589
00:23:58,830 --> 00:24:00,310
I don't know!

590
00:24:00,310 --> 00:24:01,350
You don't know!

591
00:24:01,710 --> 00:24:03,000
Then what's going on here?

592
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:05,710
Are you trying to betray my godfather?

593
00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:09,280
You fool, was it you?

594
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:10,000
Dayou.

595
00:24:10,470 --> 00:24:11,830
Did you sell me out?

596
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:12,920
No, no, Dayou!

597
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:13,710
I...

598
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:15,590
She was sent here by Wang Mao!

599
00:24:15,590 --> 00:24:16,230
Wang Mao.

600
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:17,470
It's Wang Mao!

601
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,110
Who's Wang Mao?

602
00:24:19,310 --> 00:24:20,430
The cook at the mine.

603
00:24:20,430 --> 00:24:21,640
Dayou, I panicked;

604
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:22,950
I was tricked by him!

605
00:24:22,950 --> 00:24:23,640
Get lost!

606
00:24:24,950 --> 00:24:25,640
Wang Mao!

607
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:27,230
Wang Mao!

608
00:24:27,350 --> 00:24:28,470
It must be Wang Mao.

609
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:29,520
He's the one

610
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:30,640
who led the officers here.

611
00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:31,760
Then what are you

612
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:33,070
waiting for?

613
00:24:33,350 --> 00:24:34,590
Go now!

614
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:35,710
Yes!

615
00:24:35,710 --> 00:24:36,520
Hurry up!

616
00:24:37,230 --> 00:24:38,110
Get rid of them!

617
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:40,000
Really?

618
00:25:04,230 --> 00:25:05,040
Zao Hua,

619
00:25:05,590 --> 00:25:07,280
should I go distract them?

620
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,280
There are so many people here.

621
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:10,590
How will you distract them?

622
00:25:11,190 --> 00:25:12,000
Who is it?

623
00:25:13,350 --> 00:25:14,160
Zao Hua.

624
00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:41,560
Honestly,

625
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:43,640
I really don't want to kill you.

626
00:25:44,430 --> 00:25:45,760
It would be a pity.

627
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,590
Don't hold a grudge against me.

628
00:25:52,310 --> 00:25:53,640
I'm also not in control.

629
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:01,880
For safety's sake,

630
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:02,920
I'll tie your hands and feet

631
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:04,000
with a slipknot.

632
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:06,430
If something happens, you can escape.

633
00:26:12,350 --> 00:26:13,880
You dare slap me?

634
00:26:18,430 --> 00:26:20,800
You're quite something.

635
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:23,190
But it won't help you.

636
00:26:33,350 --> 00:26:34,160
Are you okay?

637
00:26:34,190 --> 00:26:35,000
I'm fine.

638
00:26:37,310 --> 00:26:39,160
Quick, find the keys
and unlock the chains.

639
00:26:39,190 --> 00:26:40,470
I'll help you get free.

640
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:46,680
Thank you.

641
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:47,110
Hurry up.

642
00:26:47,110 --> 00:26:47,920
Thank you.

643
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:55,350
Luo Shu!

644
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:57,880
No keys!

645
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:10,190
Search!

646
00:27:10,310 --> 00:27:10,800
Yes!

647
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:11,430
Go!

648
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:22,680
Where did those two

649
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:23,310
new laborers go?

650
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:27,190
They must be in cahoots!

651
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:29,350
You fools!

652
00:27:29,350 --> 00:27:30,560
It's obvious you fell for their trick

653
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:32,070
to lure you away.

654
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:33,950
Hurry up!

655
00:27:34,190 --> 00:27:35,070
If those men

656
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:36,400
make any rash moves,

657
00:27:36,430 --> 00:27:37,520
grab your weapons and go after them.

658
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:38,190
Dayou!

659
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:39,400
These guys don't know when to hold back.

660
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:40,350
What if someone gets hurt?

661
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:43,070
It's not just about hurting them.

662
00:27:43,350 --> 00:27:44,680
Even if someone dies,

663
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:46,640
my godfather will cover for you.

664
00:27:47,230 --> 00:27:48,950
Listen to Eunuch Huang; just do it.

665
00:27:48,950 --> 00:27:49,710
Hurry up!

666
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:50,350
Go!

667
00:27:50,350 --> 00:27:51,110
Let's go!

668
00:27:51,470 --> 00:27:52,230
Go, go!

669
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,760
Captain Cai, send someone

670
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,430
to escort Zao Hua
and Doumiao down the mountain

671
00:28:05,590 --> 00:28:06,710
to seek help from Magistrate Han.

672
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:07,880
Understood. Let's go!

673
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:08,640
I'm not leaving.

674
00:28:08,710 --> 00:28:09,830
I want to be with you.

675
00:28:09,830 --> 00:28:10,560
That's nonsense.

676
00:28:10,710 --> 00:28:12,110
I'll gather people
to rescue Luo Shu and the others.

677
00:28:12,110 --> 00:28:13,000
What are you following me for?

678
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,590
I'm going with you to save them!

679
00:28:14,590 --> 00:28:15,070
You...

680
00:28:15,710 --> 00:28:16,880
Isn't the trouble you've caused me

681
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:17,830
enough?

682
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:19,760
Please don't make it worse.

683
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:21,640
If you really want to help me,

684
00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:23,190
go down the mountain
and bring reinforcements.

685
00:28:23,190 --> 00:28:24,000
If you don't want to help,

686
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,470
just walk away.

687
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:27,950
Fine.

688
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:29,280
Doumiao,

689
00:28:29,590 --> 00:28:30,350
let's go.

690
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:47,920
Qian Dayou!

691
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:49,520
Go get them!

692
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:00,680
Step aside!

693
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:01,950
Right here!

694
00:29:06,110 --> 00:29:07,160
Looks like we've hit a tough spot.

695
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:08,760
Everyone, don't be scared!

696
00:29:09,190 --> 00:29:10,400
Wu went back to send a message.

697
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:11,560
Reinforcements will be here soon.

698
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:15,950
Mr. Chen,

699
00:29:15,950 --> 00:29:17,350
where are you headed?

700
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:18,950
Are you planning

701
00:29:19,230 --> 00:29:20,680
to harm us with weapons?

702
00:29:20,710 --> 00:29:21,800
We wouldn't dare!

703
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:22,880
I just wanted to ask

704
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,190
why are you

705
00:29:25,190 --> 00:29:26,590
at our mine

706
00:29:26,830 --> 00:29:28,230
with so many people?

707
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:29,470
Are you going
to let us earn a living or not?

708
00:29:29,470 --> 00:29:30,430
Yeah!

709
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:31,760
Is this necessary?

710
00:29:31,830 --> 00:29:32,800
You better get lost!

711
00:29:35,590 --> 00:29:36,760
We're on official business.

712
00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:38,280
You and your people better step aside!

713
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:40,310
Otherwise, you'll all be taken to jail.

714
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:49,590
Let's see if you have

715
00:29:49,590 --> 00:29:51,230
what it takes.

716
00:30:00,710 --> 00:30:01,400
Go!

717
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:07,400
Hit them hard!

718
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:10,880
Tell me,

719
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:13,640
why did you sell me out?

720
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:15,710
You killed my wife, Dongmei.

721
00:30:16,190 --> 00:30:18,310
I wish I could eat your flesh

722
00:30:18,310 --> 00:30:19,160
and drink your blood.

723
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:20,710
I'll tear you to pieces!

724
00:30:22,190 --> 00:30:23,190
Who's Dongmei?

725
00:30:23,350 --> 00:30:24,160
Dongmei…

726
00:30:25,430 --> 00:30:26,950
There was a woman before

727
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:28,400
who was quite pretty.

728
00:30:28,470 --> 00:30:30,230
You said she ate your food

729
00:30:30,310 --> 00:30:31,470
and wanted to break your pots.

730
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:32,800
So you got rid of her

731
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:33,950
and gave her to us.

732
00:30:34,070 --> 00:30:34,880
What happened next?

733
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:36,110
We spent three days and three nights

734
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,680
with her,

735
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,400
and then we buried her.

736
00:30:39,710 --> 00:30:41,230
I'll kill you!

737
00:30:43,350 --> 00:30:44,640
You beasts!

738
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:45,830
You're worse than animals!

739
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:49,590
Who you are?

740
00:30:54,110 --> 00:30:55,430
Who hit me?

741
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:57,070
I did.

742
00:30:59,710 --> 00:31:01,190
I'll stab you!

743
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:03,350
I have something for you at my waist.

744
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:06,430
For me?

745
00:31:06,590 --> 00:31:07,310
For you.

746
00:31:20,230 --> 00:31:21,950
What is this thing?

747
00:31:21,950 --> 00:31:23,950
If you don't understand it,
just hand it over.

748
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,280
Deputy Commandant of Pingyangwei.

749
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:33,800
Where did you find this?

750
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:34,800
Go on, see if you can find it!

751
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:36,800
I'm from the Qi family.

752
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:40,800
My father is the Governor of Shanxi.

753
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:48,280
You're

754
00:31:48,830 --> 00:31:50,800
Governor Qi's son?

755
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:53,950
You'd better let us go quickly.

756
00:31:55,230 --> 00:31:56,680
Mr. Qian!

757
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:58,640
Mr. Chen brought a group of people

758
00:31:58,640 --> 00:31:59,710
and surrounded us!

759
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:00,640
Where's Sigou?

760
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:01,680
Gou took people

761
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:03,830
to fight the officers.

762
00:32:03,950 --> 00:32:04,560
Get lost!

763
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:07,950
Qian Dayou!

764
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,310
Who are you guys capturing?

765
00:32:12,950 --> 00:32:13,950
Mr. Qian,

766
00:32:14,470 --> 00:32:16,000
you're already at the end of your rope.

767
00:32:16,430 --> 00:32:17,350
The more you resist,

768
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:19,110
the worse your crimes will be.

769
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:21,040
His Majesty has made up his mind

770
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:23,070
to severely punish corrupt officials.

771
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:24,640
Your backer, Eunuch Zhang,

772
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:26,190
can't even protect himself anymore,

773
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:27,350
let alone protect you.

774
00:32:27,350 --> 00:32:28,160
You're talking nonsense!

775
00:32:28,470 --> 00:32:30,190
My godfather is rock solid.

776
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:32,110
As soon as he heard the slightest rumor,

777
00:32:32,110 --> 00:32:33,400
he sent you to check it out.

778
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:34,880
Isn't that a sign
that he's feeling guilty?

779
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:36,880
I think he's so scared

780
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:38,470
that he sent you
to destroy the evidence.

781
00:32:38,470 --> 00:32:39,190
Qian Dayou,

782
00:32:39,830 --> 00:32:40,830
let us go,

783
00:32:41,470 --> 00:32:42,470
and I'll spare your life.

784
00:32:43,070 --> 00:32:43,920
He's talking nonsense.

785
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:45,590
Qian Dayou,

786
00:32:46,190 --> 00:32:47,560
if you let them go,

787
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:49,230
you'll be in big trouble.

788
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:50,560
Think about it.

789
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:51,190
Not only did you

790
00:32:51,190 --> 00:32:52,350
kidnap Mr. Chen's wife,

791
00:32:52,350 --> 00:32:54,070
but you also
assaulted Governor Qi's son.

792
00:32:54,070 --> 00:32:55,950
Who do you think
will let you off the hook?

793
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:56,830
Qian Dayou,

794
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:58,230
I just got some bruises,

795
00:32:58,710 --> 00:33:00,040
and I won't hold it against you.

796
00:33:00,430 --> 00:33:01,230
Let us go.

797
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:03,350
Qian Dayou, do you believe it?

798
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:04,920
Do you dare believe it?

799
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:05,830
Don't you know

800
00:33:05,830 --> 00:33:07,470
what you've done?

801
00:33:07,710 --> 00:33:08,640
Count it up.

802
00:33:08,710 --> 00:33:09,920
Even if you had ten heads,

803
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:11,190
it wouldn't be enough to chop off!

804
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:13,070
Do you think the yamen

805
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:14,470
and Governor Qi

806
00:33:14,470 --> 00:33:15,560
will let you off?

807
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:19,920
You have no way out now.

808
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:23,710
Your only support is my godfather.

809
00:33:24,470 --> 00:33:26,680
Qian Dayou, let us go.

810
00:33:27,230 --> 00:33:28,040
Qian Dayou...

811
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:29,230
Shut up!

812
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:57,590
Eunuch Huang,

813
00:33:58,070 --> 00:33:59,000
I'm sorry.

814
00:34:00,070 --> 00:34:01,830
I was scared by them just now.

815
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:05,920
What should I do now?

816
00:34:17,910 --> 00:34:19,360
It's remote here.

817
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:21,840
Kill them.

818
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:24,080
No one will know.

819
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:26,080
But they are from the yamen.

820
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:27,870
So what if they are?

821
00:34:28,630 --> 00:34:30,560
We can blow up the mine

822
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:31,760
and bury them.

823
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,600
Even if the authorities investigate,
we won't be worried.

824
00:34:35,230 --> 00:34:37,760
We'll just say

825
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,710
it was a mining accident.

826
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:41,600
What can they do?

827
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:44,280
Trust me.

828
00:34:44,670 --> 00:34:46,800
My godfather can't be brought down.

829
00:34:47,230 --> 00:34:48,760
As long as my godfather is around,

830
00:34:48,950 --> 00:34:50,190
I don't think anyone

831
00:34:50,190 --> 00:34:51,630
will lay a finger on you.

832
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,230
Since it's come to this,

833
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:47,670
we should

834
00:35:47,670 --> 00:35:49,360
kill Mr. Chen too.

835
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:50,150
It'll save us trouble.

836
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:52,760
Eunuch Huang, that's a major crime!

837
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:56,430
Kill.

838
00:35:56,630 --> 00:35:57,390
Kill!

839
00:35:57,710 --> 00:35:58,320
Kill them all!

840
00:36:06,470 --> 00:36:07,150
Eunuch Huang!

841
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:27,800
Attacking or harming imperial officials

842
00:36:28,430 --> 00:36:29,230
is a capital crime.

843
00:36:29,470 --> 00:36:30,760
You all must die.

844
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:32,670
If the sky falls,

845
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:34,120
someone tall will hold it up.

846
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:34,760
I'm not afraid of anything.

847
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:36,950
I'm the deputy magistrate of Linfen.

848
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:38,430
Who dares to touch me?

849
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:42,670
What's a deputy magistrate?

850
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,520
This mine is owned by the Qian family.

851
00:36:44,870 --> 00:36:46,360
We only recognize our mine owner,

852
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:47,320
Qian Dayou!

853
00:36:49,670 --> 00:36:50,630
Prepare to die!

854
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:55,320
Be careful!

855
00:37:15,230 --> 00:37:16,560
Zao Hua!

856
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,560
Mei!

857
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:35,910
Zao Hua!

858
00:37:56,470 --> 00:37:57,800
Mei!

859
00:37:59,000 --> 00:37:59,870
Zao Hua!

860
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:18,670
Meiqing!

861
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:22,430
Meiqing!

862
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:38,190
Don't cry.

863
00:38:45,710 --> 00:38:48,800
I always hit you, scold you,

864
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:50,800
and be harsh with you.

865
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:53,600
But that's all

866
00:38:54,150 --> 00:38:56,080
because I want you to stay with me.

867
00:39:00,230 --> 00:39:03,600
I want to spend more time with you.

868
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:05,430
From now on, I'll listen to you.

869
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:09,000
Please don't drive me away.

870
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:10,630
Okay?

871
00:39:11,230 --> 00:39:12,320
Alright.

872
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:13,800
I won't drive you away anymore.

873
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:15,190
Never again.

874
00:39:15,190 --> 00:39:16,080
I promise

875
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:17,630
I'll always be with you,

876
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,600
and protect you.

877
00:39:22,230 --> 00:39:23,120
So...

878
00:39:24,910 --> 00:39:25,910
Mei,

879
00:39:27,910 --> 00:39:29,190
do I look

880
00:39:29,190 --> 00:39:30,670
really ugly right now?

881
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:33,000
Not ugly, not ugly.

882
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:35,520
You're the prettiest

883
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:36,470
in our family.

884
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:43,950
Mei, I...

885
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:46,800
I'm so cold.

886
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:50,950
Hold me tight.

887
00:39:50,950 --> 00:39:51,870
Okay, okay.

888
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:53,430
I'm holding you.

889
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:54,520
Hold me tight.

890
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:55,390
Okay, okay.

891
00:40:19,390 --> 00:40:21,360
Zao Hua!

892
00:40:31,710 --> 00:40:32,430
Where is everyone?

893
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:33,390
Where is everyone?

894
00:40:33,870 --> 00:40:34,910
What people?

895
00:40:34,950 --> 00:40:35,840
Luo Shu.

896
00:40:36,150 --> 00:40:37,360
And my young master.

897
00:40:37,470 --> 00:40:38,630
And my young master.

898
00:40:38,630 --> 00:40:39,870
I don't know your young master.

899
00:40:39,870 --> 00:40:40,360
I don't know.

900
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:40,950
Not saying?

901
00:40:42,190 --> 00:40:43,670
If you don't say, we'll kill you all.

902
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:45,600
Eunuch Huang.

903
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:47,190
You be quiet!

904
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:48,800
Your Honor!

905
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:50,280
Your Honor!

906
00:40:50,430 --> 00:40:51,560
Your Honor, I found

907
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:52,710
the trace left by Luo Shu.

908
00:40:52,710 --> 00:40:53,430
It's over there.

909
00:40:58,710 --> 00:40:59,760
Qi Menglin,

910
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,560
take down that light above your head.

911
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:17,120
Mao, kick it over.

912
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:20,600
Hurry!

913
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:29,190
Mao!

914
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:30,560
Dongmei,

915
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,670
I'll definitely get them out.

916
00:42:04,630 --> 00:42:05,280
Thank you.

917
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:05,760
Hurry up!

918
00:42:21,870 --> 00:42:22,320
Quick!

919
00:42:23,430 --> 00:42:23,670
Keep up!

920
00:42:31,710 --> 00:42:32,230
Hurry!

921
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:37,670
Not good, there's gunpowder!

922
00:42:37,670 --> 00:42:38,560
Run back!

923
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:39,560
Quick!

924
00:42:39,910 --> 00:42:40,600
Hurry!

925
00:42:52,710 --> 00:42:53,910
Dongmei!
