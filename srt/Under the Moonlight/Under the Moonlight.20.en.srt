Are you hungry?

5
00:01:35,230 --> 00:01:36,590
I asked them to make some porridge.

6
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:37,510
Let me go get for you.

7
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:40,270
What?

8
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:42,270
I...

9
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:45,480
I don't have much of an appetite.

10
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,040
You can't be like this!

11
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,510

21
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:24,720
Don't you worry about...?

22
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:26,800
I'm fine.

23
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:29,550

24
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:30,750

27
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:35,600
I have to face it.

28
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,240
I'm not

29
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,390

32
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,190
there's one more thing I need to do.

33
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:50,030
Okay.

39

You're quite loyal and righteous.

44

45
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,670
Hope it bring me peace of mind.

48
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:11,830

00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,910
you only owe me.

51

I don't want silver notes.

52
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:19,720
I'll give you silver ingots.

53
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:20,720
I don't want them either.

54
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:21,830
What do you want then?

55
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:24,550
I want you to owe me.

56
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:28,110
Aren't you afraid I'll run away someday,

57
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,230

58
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:29,950

59
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:30,830
I'm not afraid.

60
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:32,640
If you run away,
I'll travel all over the place

61
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:33,040

62
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:33,920

To satisfy your cravings.

66
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:16,440
It was for the buns

67
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,390
that you fell into the water

68
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:18,160

69
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:21,070
Slow down.

70
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:21,790

00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:23,160
You can't eat too greasy food.

72
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:25,440
Come on, I'm a military officer.

73
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:28,600

74
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:29,920

76
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:39,790
You're nice to me too.

77
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,600
After the mining case,

78
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,110
we are sworn friends right now.

79
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:45,790
Yes.

80
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:47,510
As the old saying goes,

81
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:49,790
it takes a hundred years
to ride in the same boat,

82
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:51,600
and a thousand
to sleep on a pillow for two.

83
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,350
We've not only
traveled in the same boat,

84
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:54,640
but also shared a pillow.

85
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:56,320
Coupled with our
going through thick and thin,

86
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,200

Han Muzhi and you don't have

92
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:07,600
this kind of connection.

93
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:09,160
Maybe in your past life,

94
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,600
you made a big mistake

95
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,320
and owed him a favor,

96
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,390
and now you need to repay him.

97
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:14,040
Who made a big mistake?

98
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:15,200
You.

gauging people's mind
and associating with countless people,

103
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:22,390
how could you fall for someone

104
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:23,000
like Han Muzhi,

105
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,790

00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:26,480
Am I right?

108
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:29,830
Mr. Qi,
I don't care if you say that about me.

109
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:31,670
It's true that I was from Mingke House,

110
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:32,720
but to say that Magistrate Han

111
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:33,830
would do whatever it takes
to get promoted

112
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:35,270
is spreading rumors behind his back.

113
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:37,070
That's rather ungallant.

114
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,510
How did I spread rumors?

115
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:42,440
He broke off an engagement

116
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:43,480
to curry favor

117
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,110
with Mr. Liu.

118
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:45,670
Didn't he do it to get promoted?

119
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:46,950
Then he used sweet talk

120
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:47,950
to trick you into falling for him.

121
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,110
When Mr. Liu and his daughter came,

122
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:49,920
he was submissive

123
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,200
and evasive.

124
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,390
What kind of man would do that?

125
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,670
He has his own difficulties.

126
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:54,880
We're not in his place,

127
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:55,720
so we don't understand.

128
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,350
He's been so indifferent to you.

129
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:58,440
Why do you defend him?

130
00:06:59,000 --> 00:06:59,600
In this world,

131
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,670
there are plenty of good men.

132
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:01,160
Why must you

133
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,550
stick to just one option with him?

134
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:03,920
What I do has nothing to do with you.

135
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:05,000
Mind your own business.

00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:39,440

Captain Cai told me.

145
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,160
He said

146
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,790
you fell ill in Hejin.

147
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:07,640

150
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,640
that I might miss you along the way.

151
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:13,600
So I've been waiting here.

152

154
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:20,000
Nothing, I just had a cold.

155
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,040
How can a cold

156
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,200
be nothing?

157
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,390

158

00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,000
Thank you.

194
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,000
Luo Shu,

195
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:24,150
there is something
Muzhi didn't tell you

196
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:27,150
but I think you should know.

197
00:11:32,590 --> 00:11:33,320
Miss Liu.

198
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:50,550
This is Luo Shu's removal papers.

199
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:59,000
Why do you have it?

200
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:01,910
If you insist on marrying her,

201
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:06,400
then she can only be of low status
for her whole life.

202
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:09,520
With my status,

203
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:11,760
I will not accept
breaking off the engagement.

204
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:13,280
You,

205
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:15,280
or freedom.

206
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,760
She has to make a choice.

207
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:21,080
If this removal papers

208
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,030
is really important to her,

209
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,790
I'm sure she'll be willing to

210
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:27,080
pay a price for it.

211
00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:29,960
Or

212
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,590
do you think she will give up

213
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,550
her freedom

214
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:38,520
for you?

215
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:46,200
I'm not saying for some purpose,

216
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:47,590
and I don't want to change anything.

217
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:48,550
I just don't want you

218
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:50,760
to misunderstand Muzhi.

219

[Linfen Yamen]

221
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:11,350
Bring Mr. Wu up.

[Impartial and Righteous]

223
00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:22,960
Your Honor,

224
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,440
I wonder

225
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:27,320
why you summoned me to the court hall.

226
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:28,440
Lv Cong,

227
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:30,960
tell the truth.

228
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:32,710
Yes, Your Honor.

229
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:36,840
That day, Mr. Wu came to me

230
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,640
and said he could
help my father to overturn.

232
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:40,350
[Impartial and Righteous]
I really wanted to save my father,

233
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:41,200
[Impartial and Righteous]
so I agreed

234
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:42,670
and gave him a large amount of money.

235
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:45,350
After that, there were two scapegoats

236
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:46,520
in Hejin County Jail.

237
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,880
Mr. Wu said everything was settled.

238
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:49,840
He asked me

239
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,470
to take the notice he got from Hejin

240
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:54,230
and beat the drum
outside the court here.

241
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:55,840
Mr. Wu.

242
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,110
Do you plead guilty?

243
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:02,910
I'm just an old man

244
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:05,350
who knows how to read.

245
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,230
How could I have the ability

246
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:09,280
to overturn for someone?

247
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:10,670
Do you know Song

248
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,520
in Hejin County Jail?

249
00:15:13,710 --> 00:15:14,440
Yes.

250
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:16,670
He confessed

251
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,470
that you went to see him last month,

252
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:21,280
abetting him to get two bandits
for collusion.

253
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,080
That's a slander.

254
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,200
He's so vicious.

255
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:26,320
I had a relapse last month

256
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,760
and had been bedridden at home.

257
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,670
I didn't go to Hejin last month.

258
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:33,840
This is Jailer Song's testimony.

259
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,960
Do you want to see it yourself?

260
00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:37,710
I also have witnesses.

261
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:40,400
My wife, neighbors,

262
00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:42,550

263
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:44,840

my husband

266
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:50,760
was indeed ill last month.

267
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:52,280
I can testify.

268
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:53,110
Every morning,

269
00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:54,520
I saw Mrs. Wu

270
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:55,710
pouring out medicine dregs at the door.

271
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:56,910
Mr. Wu bought medicine

272
00:15:56,910 --> 00:15:58,320
from my pharmacy last month.

273
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,400
He had cold-dampness syndrome.

274
00:15:59,590 --> 00:16:00,200
Your Honor,

275
00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:03,440
to clear themselves,

276
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:05,230
these two framed me,

277
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:06,840
an old man nearing the end of life.

278
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:08,590

please punish them for false accusation.

You!

You distort the facts!

283
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:19,000
It was you.

284
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,520
With the sky above as my witness,

please restore my innocence

287
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:25,760
and uphold justice today.

291
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:33,840
You're so experienced and astute.

292
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:37,350
Your Honor,

293
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,760
I was ordered to investigate,

294
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:40,520
so I have some questions for Mr. Wu.

295
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,790
How dare you!

296
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:44,230
How can a woman

297
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,880
speak in court?

298
00:16:46,030 --> 00:16:49,110
Since when did a woman
become a constable?

299
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,350
This is the court hall.

300
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:53,640
You're in no position to say that.

301
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:57,200
Just ask.

302
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:59,350
You better answer honestly.

303
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:01,280
Alright.

304
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:05,880
You said you've never been to Hejin.

305
00:17:06,070 --> 00:17:06,880
Is that true?

306
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:08,920
Yes.

307
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,520
So you haven't seen

308
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:12,230
those two bandits in jail either.

309
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,520
Have you seen them or not?

310
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:19,400
Of course not.

311
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:24,640
But they said

312
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,190
they've seen you in jail.

313
00:17:26,430 --> 00:17:27,950
You promised

314
00:17:27,950 --> 00:17:29,350
to give their families money

315
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:31,350
as long as they could
take the blame for Lv Wanchang.

316
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,680
They slandered me.

317
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:34,760
Their words are doubtful.

318
00:17:35,310 --> 00:17:36,880
But both the bandits and Jailer Song

319
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,070
confessed that

320
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:40,160
the person they saw

321
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,190
was holding a Snuff,

322
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,110
sniffing it through his nose

323
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:45,160
sometimes.

324
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50,760
Although Snuff is rare,

325
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:52,950
it's not unique.

326
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:55,400
Many high-ranking officials

327
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,400
have it.

328
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,710
But in Linfen and Hejin,

329
00:17:57,710 --> 00:17:58,830
can you find another person

330
00:17:58,830 --> 00:18:00,190
who has one,

331
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,040
especially with a blonde-hair woman portrait

332
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:05,280
on the box?

333
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,830
Search him.

334
00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:08,920
Got it.

335
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:13,710
You...

336
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:14,680
You...

337
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:18,430
Your Honor.

338
00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:21,680
You went to see
the bandits and the jailer,

339
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:23,230
and you didn't forget to take a puff.

340
00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:25,710
That thing rots your brain indeed.

341
00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:28,470
It was this Snuff

342
00:18:28,830 --> 00:18:30,070
that got you caught off guard

343
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:31,040
and showed your weakness.

344
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:34,040
Bandits' words aren't credible.

345
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,350
How could this Snuff

346
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:38,160
become the evidence?

347
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:40,280
That's ridiculous.

348
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:43,590
You have no evidence at all.

349
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:46,230
This is false accusation.

350
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:47,430
I can prove it.

351
00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:01,070
Enjoy your meal, please.

352
00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:14,000
Are all the dishes ready?

353
00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:14,880
Yes.

354
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:15,800
Alright.

355
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,110
Please.

356
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,520
How dare I let Your Honor

357
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:19,560
pour liquor personally?

358
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:20,590
Please let me do it.

359
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:20,920
Okay.

360
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
What kind of future

361
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,350
did Mr. Liu promise you

362
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:26,680
to make you spy on me

363
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:28,760
so diligently for him?

364
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:33,190
Your Honor, I'm terrified.

365
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:38,350
What are you talking about?

366
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:41,430
I'm just a minor official.

367
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:42,920
How dare I be close

368
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:43,920
to Mr. Liu?

369
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:45,590
You're right.

370
00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:47,310
Mr. Liu is the second-rank official.

371
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:47,830
How could he

372
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:49,590
be close to

373
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:50,470
an insignificant minor official,

374
00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:52,160
not to mention offering him promotion?

375
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:53,310
That's true.

376
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:55,470
Mr. Liu only uses him when needed

377
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:56,920
and gets rid of him when not.

378
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:02,070
These years you must have gained a lot

379
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:03,310
by abusing your position.

380
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:06,640
I don't quite understand.

381
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:08,040
Oh?

382
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,710
So you want me to make it clear.

383
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,310
Before you got promoted,

384
00:20:13,430 --> 00:20:14,920
you were in charge of jail.

385
00:20:15,470 --> 00:20:16,800
How many benefits did you get?

386
00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:18,880
How many wrongful convictions
did you make?

387
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:20,640
Do you need me

388
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:21,880
to list them out for you?

389
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:28,950
Your Honor, I'm innocent.

390
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:29,710
Innocent?

391
00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:31,110
Last month,

392
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:33,280
you introduced Mr. Wu

393
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,430
to Song Chang,

394
00:20:34,430 --> 00:20:36,560
your student
who works in Hejin County Jail.

395
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:39,400
You asked him to abet bandits
to give false testimony

396
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:41,190
to take the blame for Lv Wanchang.

397
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:42,350
Are you innocent?

398
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:45,000
Your Honor,

399
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:49,040
it's true that

400
00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:51,190
I taught Song Chang when he was young,

401
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:52,710
but I haven't had contact

402
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:54,230
with him these years.

403
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:56,430
I didn't know

404
00:20:56,430 --> 00:20:57,430
that he would do such a thing.

405
00:20:57,430 --> 00:20:58,400
How dare he!

406
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:03,070
You don't want to admit.

407
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:04,520
I won't force you.

408
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,920
Since we're in a restaurant today,

409
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:07,680
let's eat.

410
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:10,280
We'll leave the official business

411
00:21:11,310 --> 00:21:12,190
to the county yamen.

412
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:18,040
You're an official,

413
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:19,680
but you're not appointed
by the imperial court.

414
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:20,950
You got promoted

415
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:21,880
from a petty official.

416
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:23,310
Your promotion and dismissal

417
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:25,070
are always
in the hands of Magistrate Han.

418
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:26,160
Don't say

419
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,830
that you're not close to Mr. Liu.

420
00:21:27,830 --> 00:21:29,160
Even if you were,

421
00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:32,880
he couldn't step in to help you out
whenever he wants.

422
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:40,280
Your Honor.

423
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:41,710
I've served in the yamen

424
00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:43,160
for a lifetime.

425
00:21:43,230 --> 00:21:45,640
Even if I get no credit,
I have put in a lot of hard work.

426
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:50,350
Mr. Wei,

427
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:52,070
get up.

428
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,070
Sit down.

429
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:58,640
You've served in the yamen
for so many years,

430
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,800
and you're about to retire.

431
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:05,040
Don't you want

432
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:06,470
a satisfactory ending of your career?

433
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:15,040
What do you mean?

434
00:22:15,190 --> 00:22:16,560
It's simple.

435
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:18,310
If you sincerely repent,

436
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:20,470
and make up for it,

437
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:22,400
your past crimes will be forgiven.

438
00:22:22,430 --> 00:22:24,280
You can retire with honor.

439
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,000
But if you don't do it,

440
00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:27,160
I can bring up

441
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:28,920
all your past crimes

442
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:31,760
and deal with them according to the law.

443
00:22:36,710 --> 00:22:37,520
Your Honor,

444
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:40,470
I made a mistake.

445
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:46,350
Mr. Wu said

446
00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:48,920
he wanted to build connections in Hejin,

447
00:22:49,110 --> 00:22:51,040
so I introduced my student Song Chang

448
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:52,310
to him.

449
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:54,880
I never expected him

450
00:22:55,310 --> 00:22:56,110
to be...

451
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:58,800
so bold

452
00:22:59,190 --> 00:23:00,400
to bribe Song Chang

453
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,830
to distort the facts

454
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:04,590
and commit such a crime.

455
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:08,110
I failed to discipline my student.

456
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,040
Your Honor,

457
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:12,830
please punish both of us.

458
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:22,400
I feel ashamed to face Your Honor

459
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:25,040
and the laws of the Ming Dynasty.

460
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:27,070
All I can do is

461
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:29,520
resigning.

462
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:33,310
Mr. Wu,

463
00:23:34,430 --> 00:23:36,070
do you have anything else to say?

464
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:43,560
We managed to
kill three birds with one stone,

465
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:45,430
clearing your name of a misjudgment,

466
00:23:45,430 --> 00:23:46,280
striking down

467
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:47,710
shysters like Mr. Wu,

468
00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:50,070
and making an example out of Mr. Wei

469
00:23:50,070 --> 00:23:50,830
to warn all petty officials

470
00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:51,800
within the yamen.

471
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:52,560
I feel so good.

472
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:10,160
Muzhi.

473
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:13,400
What are you thinking about?

474
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:15,710
Meiqing,

475
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:20,350
if I had solved

476
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:22,920
the spy arranged by Mr. Liu sooner,

477
00:24:27,710 --> 00:24:28,830
would Luo Shu and I

478
00:24:28,830 --> 00:24:29,920
have ended up differently?

479
00:24:33,310 --> 00:24:34,680
It has passed.

480
00:24:35,710 --> 00:24:37,310
Don't look back.

481
00:24:41,430 --> 00:24:42,230
I know.

482
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:10,350
Your Honor.

483
00:25:16,830 --> 00:25:17,350
I thought

484
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:18,880
you would never come here again.

485
00:25:28,310 --> 00:25:29,110
What are you doing?

486
00:25:30,830 --> 00:25:32,590
This is a dead group.
[Concept in the game of Go]

487
00:26:05,710 --> 00:26:06,710
Thank you

488
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:09,190
for helping me gain freedom.

489
00:26:36,070 --> 00:26:37,070
Actually, that day

490
00:26:38,190 --> 00:26:39,560
we just coincidentally made

491
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:41,000
the same choice.

492
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:43,800
If you let me choose,

493
00:26:44,830 --> 00:26:46,160
I'd also choose freedom.

494
00:26:46,830 --> 00:26:48,190
Don't blame yourself.

495
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,470
You owe me nothing.

496
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:53,430
I should thank you.

497
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:11,110
What's your plan for the future?

498
00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:15,110
For all these years,

499
00:27:16,190 --> 00:27:17,800
my only wish

500
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:19,520
was to leave Mingke House

501
00:27:19,950 --> 00:27:21,160
and have freedom.

502
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,950
Now that my wish has come true,

503
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,640
I feel a bit lost.

504
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:29,520
I don't know what to do next.

505
00:27:32,710 --> 00:27:33,920
Do you like here?

506
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:35,710
Do you like your current life?

507
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:37,800
Of course, I do.

508
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:38,880
If you do,

509
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:40,920
don't think too much.

510
00:27:42,950 --> 00:27:44,830
I do like my life in here,

511
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:46,400
and I enjoy investigating cases.

512
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:48,590
But staying here

513
00:27:48,590 --> 00:27:50,040
was expedient.

514
00:27:50,590 --> 00:27:52,110
Now I should leave.

515
00:27:52,950 --> 00:27:54,590
Besides, I'm not suited for it.

516
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:55,400
You are.

517
00:27:57,230 --> 00:27:58,680
You have talent and passion.

518
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:00,070
No one will do it better than you.

519
00:28:02,230 --> 00:28:03,040
Thank you,

520
00:28:03,710 --> 00:28:04,430
but...

521
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:05,680
There's no but.

522
00:28:08,470 --> 00:28:09,280
Stay.

523
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:11,520
I really hope

524
00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:13,160
you can become a part of the yamen,

525
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,040
as long as you don't mind

526
00:28:16,430 --> 00:28:17,430
starting out

527
00:28:17,430 --> 00:28:19,160
as a petty official.

528
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:21,950
Of course, I don't mind.

529
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:23,280
I'd love it.

530
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:24,560
Alright.

531
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:26,400
Starting tomorrow,

532
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:27,920
you'll be a registered constable

533
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:29,280
in Linfen.

534
00:28:31,350 --> 00:28:32,310
Thank you, Your Honor.

535
00:28:32,830 --> 00:28:34,680
I won't let you down.

536
00:28:35,430 --> 00:28:36,160
Good.

537
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:21,350
Muzhi,

538
00:29:22,110 --> 00:29:23,710
don't you forget that

539
00:29:23,710 --> 00:29:24,680
Liu Wan also had another condition?

540
00:29:25,590 --> 00:29:26,590
Giving up this relationship

541
00:29:26,590 --> 00:29:27,830
is the biggest concession

542
00:29:27,830 --> 00:29:29,040
I can make.

543
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,110
Luo Shu has talent.

544
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:35,400
She should do

545
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:36,680
what she is good at.

546
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:39,280
It's also good for the yamen.

547
00:29:39,470 --> 00:29:41,280
Can you say
you have no ulterior motives?

548
00:29:43,110 --> 00:29:45,310
It's impossible for you two
to be together.

549
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:47,190
Why do you do that?

550
00:29:51,430 --> 00:29:52,230
Meiqing,

551
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:58,800
I just want to

552
00:30:02,950 --> 00:30:04,350
be a little closer to her.

553
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:15,310
Six.

554
00:30:16,350 --> 00:30:17,160
Seven.

555
00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:19,000
Eight.

556
00:30:20,710 --> 00:30:21,280
One.

557
00:30:23,470 --> 00:30:24,040
Two.

558
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:26,830
Three.

559
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:29,040
Four.

560
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:31,430
Five.

561
00:30:33,950 --> 00:30:34,590
Six.

562
00:30:35,310 --> 00:30:37,000
Young Master,
you've just recovered from illness.

563
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,470
You can't handle such training.

564
00:30:38,950 --> 00:30:40,160
How about taking a break?

565
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:40,830
Have some tea.

566
00:30:45,070 --> 00:30:46,590
When you need to apply knowledge,
you wish you'd read more.

567
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:49,230
When you're sick,
you wish you'd stay fit.

568
00:30:49,950 --> 00:30:51,160
Especially after a serious illness,

569
00:30:51,590 --> 00:30:52,800
I need to exercise more.

570
00:30:53,110 --> 00:30:54,110
Yes, Young Master.

571
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:55,760
As a leader,

572
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,160
I must lead by example.

573
00:30:57,710 --> 00:30:59,160
Slow down, it's hot.

574
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:00,800
Report!

575
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:03,920
Commandant Qi, something's wrong.

576
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,400
Two villages by Fen River

577
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:06,560
are fighting over water.

578
00:31:08,350 --> 00:31:09,830
Your Honor, two villages are fighting,

579
00:31:09,830 --> 00:31:11,230
it could turn deadly.

580
00:31:11,310 --> 00:31:12,680
Shall we send troops?

581
00:31:13,350 --> 00:31:14,400
Is that our responsibility?

582
00:31:14,470 --> 00:31:15,070
Technically,

583
00:31:15,070 --> 00:31:16,230
it's Linfen Yamen's business.

584
00:31:16,350 --> 00:31:17,950
Since we're stationed here,

585
00:31:17,950 --> 00:31:18,830
we have a duty to assist.

586
00:31:18,950 --> 00:31:19,880
When I came back,

587
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:20,920
the constables from the yamen

588
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,040
were already there.

589
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:23,950
Luo Shu, oh no.

590
00:31:23,950 --> 00:31:24,950
Form up!

591
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:25,760
Form up!

592
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:37,950
Stop it.

593
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:38,950
Guys,

594
00:31:39,070 --> 00:31:40,000
catch the head!

595
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,560
Arrest anyone who resists.

596
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:42,040
Got it.

597
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:45,880
Mr. Qi.

598
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:47,470
Mr. Qi,

599
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:48,950
you are so fast.

600
00:31:49,070 --> 00:31:49,880
Where's Luo Shu?

601
00:31:50,470 --> 00:31:51,560
Didn't she go to get you

602
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:52,520
for reinforcement?

603
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:53,830
I didn't see her.

604
00:31:54,470 --> 00:31:56,230
Where could she go?

605
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:13,430
Come on.

606
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:14,400
Open your mouth.

607
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:25,230
Come in.

608
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:29,190
Open the door.

609
00:33:30,430 --> 00:33:31,160
Open the door.

610
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:34,400
Open the door!

611
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:51,190
It's you.

612
00:33:51,350 --> 00:33:53,920
Didn't expect me
to still be in Linfen, huh?

613
00:33:54,230 --> 00:33:56,190
You're a lady from a prestigious family.

614
00:33:56,590 --> 00:33:58,280
I didn't expect you

615
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,640
do something like this.

616
00:34:01,190 --> 00:34:02,110
Did I show too much mercy

617
00:34:02,110 --> 00:34:03,430
to you last time,

618
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:04,760
making you think

619
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:06,110
I'm a pushover?

620
00:34:06,470 --> 00:34:08,120
Although I'm of low status,

621
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:10,320
I will not tolerate being threatened.

622
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:12,910
What exactly do you want to do?

623
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:13,800
Please speak frankly.

624
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:15,390
Are you really knowing nothing of it

625
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:18,000
or just pretending to be?

626
00:34:18,670 --> 00:34:20,560
Do you think you've got removal papers

627
00:34:20,710 --> 00:34:22,230
and you can do whatever you want,

628
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:23,630
breaking promise,

629
00:34:23,910 --> 00:34:25,000
and keep staying in the yamen

630
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,000
to approach Muzhi?

631
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:27,600
I'm telling you,

632
00:34:28,230 --> 00:34:29,520
I can help you remove your status,

633
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:31,560
and naturally, I have ways

634
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,560
to make you a low-status person again.

635
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:35,870
What do you mean by breaking promise?

636
00:34:35,870 --> 00:34:36,870
Don't play dumb.

637
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:40,120
Muzhi promised me that

638
00:34:40,670 --> 00:34:42,390
as long as I gave you removal papers,

639
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,320
he would break off with you,

640
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:46,120
and ask you to leave the yamen.

641
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:53,870
I didn't know about this.

642
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:55,760
How could you not know?

643
00:34:55,950 --> 00:34:57,630
You just don't want to let go.

644
00:34:57,950 --> 00:34:59,230
Now that you know,

645
00:34:59,390 --> 00:35:00,320
what are you going to do?

646
00:35:03,190 --> 00:35:04,430
I'll leave as soon as possible.

647
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:08,360
Really?

648
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:10,430
I'm leaving the yamen

649
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,870
to keep Magistrate Han's promise,

650
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:15,190
not because I've done something wrong.

651
00:35:15,710 --> 00:35:16,630
There's nothing between

652
00:35:16,630 --> 00:35:17,800
me and Magistrate Han.

653
00:35:18,470 --> 00:35:19,630
I stayed at the yamen

654
00:35:19,670 --> 00:35:20,360
just because

655
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:21,520
I like my life

656
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:22,430
and my job here.

657
00:35:37,230 --> 00:35:37,870
Who's there?

658
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:39,190
Someone!

659
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:40,800
Thief!

660
00:35:41,230 --> 00:35:42,080
Catch the thief!

661
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:43,000
- Madam. - Zi Yan.

662
00:35:43,230 --> 00:35:44,000
Madam, are you okay?

663
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:44,710
Catch the thief!

664
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:45,630
What happened?

665
00:35:45,630 --> 00:35:47,280
What are you doing here?
Catch the thief.

666
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:47,910
That way.

667
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:48,430
Got it.

668
00:35:48,430 --> 00:35:49,190
Hurry up.

669
00:35:50,430 --> 00:35:51,120
Don't worry.

670
00:35:51,430 --> 00:35:52,360
It's okay.

671
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:01,360
Why do you look like this?

672
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:04,080
Even if my people were rude,

673
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:06,190
they wouldn't make you like this.

674
00:36:06,470 --> 00:36:07,840
Villagers fought over water,

675
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,430
so we went to mediate on the spot.

676
00:36:09,710 --> 00:36:10,870
I encountered some reckless ones.

677
00:36:10,870 --> 00:36:12,470
It was inevitable to end up like this.

678
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:14,230
There was no time
to care about my appearance.

679
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:16,630
This is the life you like?

680
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:18,840
Yes.

681
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:21,080
I use my own hands

682
00:36:21,190 --> 00:36:23,000
to do what I can.

683
00:36:23,430 --> 00:36:24,230
Every day,

684
00:36:24,950 --> 00:36:26,470
it makes me feel fulfilled.

685
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:30,040
You probably don't understand.

686
00:36:32,670 --> 00:36:34,150
I have official duties,

687
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:35,150
please...

688
00:36:35,150 --> 00:36:37,150
Catch the thief.

689
00:36:37,190 --> 00:36:38,000
Let me go.

690
00:36:38,430 --> 00:36:38,950
Let me go.

691
00:36:38,950 --> 00:36:39,910
Hand over her.

692
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:40,950
Hand over Luo Shu.

693
00:36:40,950 --> 00:36:41,710
Where is Luo Shu?

694
00:36:41,710 --> 00:36:42,910
Do you know who I am?

695
00:36:43,470 --> 00:36:44,280
Hold him down!

696
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:45,000
How dare you.

697
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:45,560
Hold him down!

698
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:46,600
Do you know who I am?

699
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:47,390
Let me go.

700
00:36:47,390 --> 00:36:48,120
How dare you.

701
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:50,430
Madam, we caught the thief.

702
00:36:50,630 --> 00:36:51,360
Watch her.

703
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:52,000
Yes.

704
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:54,080
Let me go!

705
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:54,600
Hold him down!

706
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:55,360
Let me go!

707
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:56,600
How dare you tie me up!

708
00:36:56,870 --> 00:36:58,520
He is the thief?

709
00:36:58,560 --> 00:36:59,360
Madam,

710
00:36:59,390 --> 00:37:01,190
this thief was sitting astride the wall,

711
00:37:01,190 --> 00:37:01,910
so we caught him.

712
00:37:01,910 --> 00:37:02,840
Who are you calling a thief?

713
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:03,520
All you know

714
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:04,520
is about claiming credit.

715
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:05,560
So money-grubbing.

716
00:37:05,670 --> 00:37:06,710
Do you know who you are?

717
00:37:06,710 --> 00:37:07,600
Do you know who I am?

718
00:37:09,950 --> 00:37:10,840
I remember you.

719
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:13,360
Hurry up and hand over her.

720
00:37:14,870 --> 00:37:15,630
Who?

721
00:37:15,630 --> 00:37:16,760
Play dumb with me, huh?

722
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,000
Hand over Luo Shu.

723
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:18,760
Hurry up,

724
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,040
or I'll make you sorry.

725
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:21,040
You,

726
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:22,080
I've remembered your face.

727
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:23,670
Miss Liu, what should we do?

728
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,950
I heard there was a thief in your room.

729
00:37:29,230 --> 00:37:29,910
You rely on

730
00:37:29,910 --> 00:37:31,280
the support of Mr. Liu,

731
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:32,470
disregarding the law.

732
00:37:32,470 --> 00:37:34,520
You kidnapped a woman in broad daylight.

733
00:37:34,630 --> 00:37:35,390
Do you know who I am?

734
00:37:35,390 --> 00:37:35,870
Can you keep it down?

735
00:37:35,870 --> 00:37:36,670
Why should I keep down?

736
00:37:36,670 --> 00:37:37,320
Can you stop talking?

737
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:38,230
Stop talking?

738
00:37:38,230 --> 00:37:39,080
Hand over Luo Shu.

739
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:39,910
How dare you tie me up!

740
00:37:39,910 --> 00:37:40,360
Gag him.

741
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:40,840
How dare you.

742
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:42,080
Hurry up.

743
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:44,710
Master is here.

744
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,600
Is he the thief?

745
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:06,910
He...

746
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:09,360
He doesn't look like a thief.

747
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:14,630
Madam,

748
00:38:14,870 --> 00:38:15,670
you can't judge a thief

749
00:38:15,670 --> 00:38:17,080
only by his appearance.

750
00:38:17,390 --> 00:38:18,430
Since there was a thief,

751
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:20,230
you better go and check

752
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:21,430
to make sure nothing is missed.

753
00:38:24,390 --> 00:38:25,470
You're right.

754
00:38:25,670 --> 00:38:26,470
Zi Yan.

755
00:38:27,670 --> 00:38:28,800
I'll go help.

756
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:31,360
You don't have to bother.

757
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:33,080
Don't mention it.

758
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:34,120
Shuang.

759
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:36,000
Wenyin,

760
00:38:37,670 --> 00:38:38,870
Yue means well.

761
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:49,150
Hold him.

762
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:03,520
Can...

763
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,120
Can you do me a favor?

764
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:08,190
You kidnapped me.

765
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:09,760
What can I help you with?

766
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:10,840
Miss Liu,

767
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:12,120
you don't need to...

768
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:13,520
Shut up and untie her.

769
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:14,630
Got it.

770
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:20,080
It was my fault to bring you here.

771
00:39:21,390 --> 00:39:22,430
I apologize.

772
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:28,150
But this is urgent.

773
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:30,470
Mr. Qi is here to look for you.

774
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:33,430
My cousin's mansion

775
00:39:33,430 --> 00:39:34,670
seems to have been broken into.

776
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:36,870
Mr. Qi was mistaken for a thief

777
00:39:36,870 --> 00:39:37,800
and caught.

778
00:39:38,230 --> 00:39:41,230
I brought you here without telling them.

779
00:39:42,150 --> 00:39:43,320
Now they mistakenly

780
00:39:43,670 --> 00:39:45,000
captured Mr. Qi.

781
00:39:45,670 --> 00:39:46,470
If Mr. Qi

782
00:39:46,470 --> 00:39:47,470
makes a fuss,

783
00:39:47,870 --> 00:39:49,360
it might cause trouble

784
00:39:49,390 --> 00:39:50,280
for my cousin and her husband.

785
00:39:53,190 --> 00:39:53,910
I...

786
00:39:55,470 --> 00:39:56,470
I want to...

787
00:39:56,670 --> 00:39:57,840
invite me here for a chat.

788
00:40:00,430 --> 00:40:01,230
Wait.

789
00:40:03,630 --> 00:40:06,560
You can't go out like this.

790
00:40:07,630 --> 00:40:08,430
He Xiang,

791
00:40:08,910 --> 00:40:10,150
go find one of my clothes

792
00:40:10,150 --> 00:40:11,230
and help Miss Luo to change.

793
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:12,390
Got it.

794
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,670
Why are you so nervous?

795
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:25,910
I'm afraid that someone

796
00:40:25,950 --> 00:40:27,120
is not here to look for something,

797
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,470
but to stuff something in.

798
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:37,670
Please forgive me.

799
00:40:37,910 --> 00:40:39,670
I found Master's underclothes.

800
00:40:46,150 --> 00:40:46,670
This...

801
00:40:46,670 --> 00:40:47,190
It...

802
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:48,470
It's not

803
00:40:48,470 --> 00:40:50,120
Master's underclothes.

804
00:40:51,950 --> 00:40:52,800
Master, look,

805
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:55,560
It doesn't seem like
the fabric you usually wear.

806
00:40:58,630 --> 00:40:59,430
Madam.

807
00:40:59,870 --> 00:41:01,320
Whose is this?

808
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:04,910
I don't know.

809
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:06,000
I don't know how this thing

810
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,390
got into my room.

811
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:09,320
What do you mean, Madam?

812
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:09,800
Are you saying

813
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,190
Shuang put it here?

814
00:41:11,390 --> 00:41:11,870
You...

815
00:41:11,870 --> 00:41:13,080
But you just saw it,

816
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:13,520
she didn't

817
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:14,760
have anything in her hands.

818
00:41:16,870 --> 00:41:17,670
Xian.

819
00:41:17,910 --> 00:41:18,630
I really don't know

820
00:41:18,630 --> 00:41:19,600
whose this is?

821
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:21,630
I really don't know.

822
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:25,430
I know.

823
00:41:26,190 --> 00:41:26,760
I...

824
00:41:27,230 --> 00:41:27,910
Xian.

825
00:41:30,150 --> 00:41:30,950
Xian.

826
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:33,150
Wait.

827
00:41:33,630 --> 00:41:35,280
Don't.

828
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:36,470
Stop.

829
00:41:36,470 --> 00:41:37,950
Is it his?

830
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:39,320
No.

831
00:41:39,630 --> 00:41:41,080
It's not what you think.

832
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:41,840
Master,

833
00:41:42,150 --> 00:41:43,360
no wonder she is so nervous

834
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:44,560
and says he's not a thief.

835
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:45,360
She protects him so much

836
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:46,870
in front of you.

837
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:49,280
It seems that
they have a deep connection.

838
00:41:51,150 --> 00:41:52,710
How dare you!

839
00:41:53,910 --> 00:41:54,430
Don't.

840
00:41:54,430 --> 00:41:55,430
Drag this damn thief away.

841
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:58,760
Beat him to death.

842
00:41:58,760 --> 00:41:59,710
Beat him

843
00:41:59,710 --> 00:42:00,190
Don't.

844
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:01,470
to death.

845
00:42:01,950 --> 00:42:02,840
It's a misunderstanding!

846
00:42:05,870 --> 00:42:07,040
He's not a thief.

847
00:42:07,230 --> 00:42:08,150
He's here to see me.

848
00:42:22,670 --> 00:42:24,040
Sorry to disturb you.

849
00:42:25,870 --> 00:42:26,520
Who is this lady?

850
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,430
This is Miss Luo.

851
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:30,630
She's my...

852
00:42:32,670 --> 00:42:33,560
close friend.

853
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:37,800
I didn't expect

854
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:39,430
that you'd be home today.

855
00:42:39,470 --> 00:42:40,910
I thought you were out.

856
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:42,910
Let him go.

857
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,080
Let go.

858
00:42:51,710 --> 00:42:52,870
How dare you!

859
00:42:52,870 --> 00:42:53,870
How dare you tie me up!
