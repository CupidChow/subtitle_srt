[Episode 22]

4
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:36,550
Come on, hurry up!

5
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:49,310
Quickly, be more efficient!

6
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:55,080
Faster!

7
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,190
Thank you. Just go.

8
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:13,750
After the verdict,
those from the incense hall

9
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:15,830
have been locked up in the jail.

10
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:17,750
Are you planning

11
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,030
to take Niu Dali's body

12
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:20,080
to the yamen

13
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:21,360
for identification?

14
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,390
Madam.

15
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:24,830
Madam, it's bad news!

16
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,240
Bad news, Madam!

17
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:27,630
Niu Dali's body

18
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:29,550
has been taken away by his family.

19
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:30,830
- What?
- What?

20
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,160
Qi Menglin!

21
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:45,720
Qi Menglin!

22
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:47,240
Wake up!

23
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:49,390
Niu Dali's body has been taken away!

24
00:02:58,390 --> 00:02:59,190
Come on!

25
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,320
Hold on to me.

26
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,520
Young Master, be careful!

27
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,190
Let's go!

28
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,030
Do you know this man?

29
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,160
Yes.

30
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:38,960
He was once

31
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,630
my disciple.

32
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:45,750
His name was Lisheng.

33
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,190
Just as I thought.

34
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:48,630
Let's go.

35
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:49,470
Wait!

36
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:51,080
Chief Luo,

37
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:53,110
I suppose this counts

38
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:54,240
as meritorious service, right?

39
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:56,750
Can you plead for me with the higher-ups

40
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:59,110
to spare me from the death penalty?

41
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:01,000
Stop talking nonsense. Let's go!

42
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:02,390
Chief Luo,

43
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:04,360
I haven't killed anyone or set fires.

44
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:05,830
I shouldn't be sentenced to death!

45
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,000
Let me go!

46
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:08,600
Chief Luo!

47
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:12,030
Earlier,

48
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:13,630
our deductions were indeed correct.

49
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:16,040
Niu Dali and Yue

50
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:17,760
have a secret.

51
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:19,920
Yue killed Niu Dali

52
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:21,070
to end everything.

53
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,070
Do you still have doubts?

54
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,110
Are you thinking

55
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,640
that a weak woman like Yue

56
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:30,390
couldn't possibly kill

57
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:31,670
a strong man like Niu Dali?

58
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,760
It's not impossible for one person.

59
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:36,720
Mr. Xu found

60
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,040
bruising on the back of the head

61
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,670
from a heavy blow.

62
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:40,920
It's likely the murderer

63
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,200
attacked Niu Dali from behind

64
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:44,230
when he was caught off guard,

65
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:45,670
and then dragged him into the stable.

66
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,950
By tying one end of a rope

67
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:58,480
around Niu Dali's neck

68
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,510
and the other end to a horse,

69
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:02,160
using the horse

70
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,510
to lift the body,

71
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:05,440
it can create the illusion of suicide.

72
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:28,200
There's no time to lose.

73
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:29,320
We need to notify the yamen

74
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,200
to come and arrest her.

75
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,600
I was just analyzing

76
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,000
the murder method of the killer.

77
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:34,790
I didn't say

78
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:36,000
that she must be the real killer.

79
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,270
She does have the potential to kill,

80
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:39,550
but I still feel

81
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:41,110
there are some inconsistencies.

82
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,110
She has the intent to kill

83
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,320
and the strength to do so.

84
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,760
What's still inconsistent?

85
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,000
Yue only wanted

86
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,270
to frame Mrs. Zhou for infidelity,

87
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,640
creating grounds for divorce.

88
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,640
Her objective has been achieved.

89
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:52,830
Killing Niu Dali

90
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:54,160
would only complicate things.

91
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:56,040
Why would she go to such lengths?

92
00:05:56,670 --> 00:05:57,670
She sensed

93
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,110
that we found out about Niu Dali.

94
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:00,830
Seeing that her secret
was about to come to light,

95
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:03,110
isn't it normal for her to silence him?

96
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:04,440
Taking the risk to kill

97
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,550
or paying him off

98
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:06,790
to hide for a while,

99
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:08,350
which would you choose?

100
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:10,950
Hiding would still result

101
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,390
in a manhunt.

102
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,160
If he was caught and brought back,

103
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,510
her secret with Niu Dali

104
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:16,600
would be exposed.

105
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:17,880
If Zhou Xian

106
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:19,720
learns that his son

107
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:20,950
is not his biological child,

108
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,670
Yue's fate is clear.

109
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,790
Thus, she killed Niu Dali

110
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,350
to completely eliminate

111
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:29,070
the potential threat

112
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:30,790
from that man,

113
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:32,600
and to escape

114
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,230
from the endless extortion.

115
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:36,040
This is the reason

116
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,790
why Yue decided

117
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:39,200
to kill Niu Dali.

118
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,480
That makes sense.

119
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:43,880
Then please, Miss Luo,

120
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:44,880
hurry back to the yamen

121
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:45,920
and bring people to make arrests.

122
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,510
Do you know why the incense hall case

123
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:50,920
has been kept under wraps?

124
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:52,160
Why?

125
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:53,350
Because it concerns the reputation

126
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:54,720
of many victimized women.

127
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,830
If it were made public,

128
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,390
many of them might not survive.

129
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,720
If we openly arrest Yue for questioning,

130
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,440
it would inevitably expose

131
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,600
the secrets of the incense hall case.

132
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,480
Miss Liu, you're well-educated,

133
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:08,040
so I'm sure you understands

134
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,390
the magistrate's concerns.

135
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:14,390
What should we do?

136
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:22,670
Should we let that wretch go?

137
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,830
We need a more secure plan.

138
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:27,720
She is pressing me hard.

139
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:29,000
I have no way out.

140
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:30,270
Now the truth is out,

141
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:31,790
are we just going to let her be?

142
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:32,920
Don't worry.

143
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:34,390
Since I promised you,

144
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:36,000
I will ensure you are not wronged.

145
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:37,720
Let me think.

146
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,110
No need.

147
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:43,720
Carrying this disgrace

148
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,000
for another day

149
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:47,760
is worse than death.

150
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:53,350
I know you're worried about Mr. Han.

151
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,480
Though I have a husband,

152
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:57,270
he is as good as nonexistent.

153
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,320
Living on

154
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:00,880
has no meaning anymore.

155
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:03,920
Wenyin, don't do anything foolish.

156
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:06,110
What's wrong?

157
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:07,320
Nothing.

158
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,110
Let me see.

159
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:11,830
What happened?

160
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:17,320
Zhou Xian hit you?

161
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:18,640
Stop asking.

162
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:28,830
Cai,
I should have welcomed you properly.

163
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:30,830
There's no need for formality, Mr. Zhou.

164
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:31,920
Miss Liu reported to the authorities

165
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,550
that a murder
occurred at your residence.

166
00:08:33,790 --> 00:08:35,550
We are here to investigate.

167
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,150
But my home is peaceful.

168
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:41,550
There's no murder here.

169
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:43,640
Is there a mistake?

170
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:50,640
I reported it.

171
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,150
The groom died strangely.

172
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:53,200
Life and death are serious matters.

173
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,150
Shouldn't the officers

174
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:55,200
come to investigate?

175
00:08:58,150 --> 00:08:59,440
Cai, I remember now.

176
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,400
A few days ago, my groom

177
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:03,710
indeed hanged himself in the stable.

178
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:06,110
All of them witnessed it.

179
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:07,910
How can this be considered a murder?

180
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:11,030
My cousin is naive,

181
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:12,910
making a mountain out of a molehill.

182
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,760
Cai, don't take it seriously.

183
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:20,110
Niu Dali didn't commit suicide.

184
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,080
This was a murder disguised as hanging.

185
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:23,110
The murderer

186
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:25,080
is right here.

187
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,280
Miss Liu, why are you looking at me?

188
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,640
What does this have to do with me?

189
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:31,400
Does it have nothing to do with you?

190
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:32,910
You know the answer.

191
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:33,960
I...

192
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,670
Go persuade your cousin

193
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:40,520
to send the officers away.

194
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:41,880
If this escalates,

195
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,200
it won't be good for anyone.

196
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:52,760
Wenyin.

197
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,200
Wan.

198
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:56,470
Let's just forget it.

199
00:09:56,910 --> 00:09:58,470
For the sake of Xian's reputation.

200
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:05,590
Xian is a learned man.

201
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,400
He would never tarnish
the name of the wise.

202
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,790
He wouldn't confuse right and wrong,

203
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:10,960
or turn black into white.

204
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,030
He wouldn't condone evil.

205
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:13,880
You...

206
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:15,520
Arrest her! What are you waiting for?

207
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:16,880
Arrest her!

208
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:17,640
What?

209
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:18,400
Wait!

210
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,910
Xian, I haven't done anything!

211
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:21,320
Don't let them arrest me, Xian!

212
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:24,000
She is my concubine.

213
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:25,960
You have no evidence.

214
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,080
On what grounds are you arresting her?

215
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,150
It's necessary for the investigation.

216
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:29,880
Please understand, Mr. Zhou.

217
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:30,760
Xian,

218
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:32,880
she is currently a suspect.

219
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,400
The authorities
need to take her in for questioning.

220
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:35,550
Isn't that only right?

221
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:36,590
You are obstructing this,

222
00:10:36,590 --> 00:10:37,470
and that is wrong.

223
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:38,590
Is there any evidence?

224
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:40,880
Why are you just standing there?

225
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:42,670
As the mistress,

226
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:44,320
you should manage your cousin.

227
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:45,710
Maintaining family honor

228
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:46,760
is your responsibility.

229
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:47,440
Will you just watch

230
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,550
as they arrest her?

231
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:50,880
Are you so unwilling

232
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:51,880
to see her suffer?

233
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,280
You can't even bear

234
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:53,880
to let her go to the authorities?

235
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:54,640
Shut up!

236
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:55,840
The Zhou family is of scholarly descent.

237
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,080
How can we get involved in a lawsuit?

238
00:10:58,710 --> 00:10:59,520
Xian,

239
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:01,150
even if you don't care for me,

240
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:02,440
you must think of our son.

241
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:04,110
He can't be without me.

242
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,230
Wenyin.

243
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:14,150
Wenyin,

244
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:15,670
the child is still young.

245
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:17,200
He needs his mother.

246
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,840
Don't let them take her away.

247
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:21,470
I'm begging you.

248
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:22,960
You can't let them take her.

249
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:25,280
I'm begging you.

250
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:27,910
Please, I beg you.

251
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,230
Do you know

252
00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:37,710
that the son you treasure

253
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,030
is likely not your own?

254
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:40,000
You're talking nonsense!

255
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:40,710
What are you doing?

256
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:41,320
You're talking nonsense!

257
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:42,280
What are you doing?

258
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,440
Mr. Zhou, calm down.

259
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:45,960
How about both sides take a step back?

260
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,000
No need to take her
to the yamen for questioning.

261
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:49,760
How about we question her here?

262
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:56,470
Thank you, Miss Luo.

263
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:00,280
The Zhou family
walks upright and sits straight.

264
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,710
There's nothing shameful.

265
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:03,960
Please.

266
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:14,670
What is your relationship

267
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:16,110
with Niu Dali?

268
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:18,550
He...

269
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:21,760
he is just a distant cousin.

270
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:23,670
There's nothing between us.

271
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:24,440
You once went

272
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:26,400
to the incense hall in Xiandonggou
to seek a child.

273
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:28,080
Is that true?

274
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:29,710
The incense hall?

275
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:33,400
I have been there.

276
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,200
Xian knows this as well.

277
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,320
It really was effective.

278
00:12:37,710 --> 00:12:39,470
Afterwards, I became pregnant.

279
00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:41,350
I've always told Xian

280
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:42,640
that I wanted to go back to give thanks.

281
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,230
I indeed know about this.

282
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:48,440
What's wrong with it?

283
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:54,220
[Cases in Linfen, Pingyang Volume 18]

284
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:55,880
That incense hall

285
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,960
is not a legitimate place.

286
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,910
It's a group of bandits in disguise,

287
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:02,110
secretly coercing women seeking children

288
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,640
to extort money.

289
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:05,640
Last year,

290
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:08,550
the yamen wiped them out.

291
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,230
Although it was kept confidential,

292
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:11,840
the records

293
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,670
clearly state it.

294
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,670
Your groom, Niu Dali,

295
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:18,790
was originally named Niu Lisheng.

296
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,880
He was a remnant of the bandits.

297
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:25,110
But what does that prove?

298
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:26,760
It proves that Yue's son

299
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,150
is not yours.

300
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:29,230
It is very likely

301
00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:31,230
that he is Niu Dali's child.

302
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,960
Though this isn't a court,

303
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:35,520
there are officials
asking questions here.

304
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:38,030
Wan, don't speak carelessly.

305
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:42,440
What do you have to say?

306
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:44,400
You're talking nonsense!

307
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:45,640
You all are talking nonsense!

308
00:13:45,710 --> 00:13:47,080
Xian!

309
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,640
They are lying, Xian!

310
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:49,910
I haven't done anything!

311
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:50,640
Xian!

312
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:51,670
The child is yours!

313
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:52,790
He really is yours, Xian!

314
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:54,150
Miss Liu is slandering me.

315
00:13:54,150 --> 00:13:55,470
You have to believe me!

316
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,350
As for Niu Dali's death,

317
00:13:57,350 --> 00:13:58,670
it has nothing to do with you?

318
00:13:58,670 --> 00:13:59,590
Of course.

319
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:00,910
I didn't kill him.

320
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:03,000
Then I'll ask you again.

321
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:05,670
What is your relationship with Niu Dali?

322
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:07,400
Are you really just distant relatives,

323
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,080
or did you meet him

324
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,670
when you were seeking a child
at the incense hall?

325
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:16,760
We're

326
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,550
distant relatives.

327
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,030
Was it you who had Niu Dali's body

328
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:22,880
taken away by his family?

329
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:26,400
Yes.

330
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,440
But they confessed

331
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,440
that they are not actually
Niu Dali's relatives.

332
00:14:30,030 --> 00:14:31,200
It was you who paid them

333
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,790
to bury the body.

334
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:35,280
Captain Cai.

335
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,760
Why not send someone to the yamen

336
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:38,350
to summon Niu Dali's

337
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:39,640
family members

338
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:40,640
for questioning?

339
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:41,400
That works.

340
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:42,080
Xian.

341
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:45,840
Cai,

342
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:49,230
there's no rush.

343
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:50,670
It's already mealtime.

344
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:53,080
Why don't we all take a break first

345
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,520
and enjoy the meal?

346
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,030
We can continue the questioning later.

347
00:14:58,470 --> 00:14:59,280
What do you think?

348
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:01,910
That sounds good.

349
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:03,880
Let's listen to Mr. Zhou

350
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:05,030
and eat first.

351
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:09,880
Prepare the food.

352
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:16,550
Why are you...?

353
00:15:37,590 --> 00:15:38,400
Xian.

354
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:40,640
Yue.

355
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:43,470
Is the child

356
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:46,910
mine?

357
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:52,230
Xian,

358
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:54,030
I'm doing all this for you,

359
00:15:54,030 --> 00:15:55,550
for the Zhou family!

360
00:15:57,150 --> 00:15:59,110
We've loved each other
for so many years,

361
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:02,520
growing up together, living in harmony.

362
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:05,840
But we just don't have children.

363
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:07,670
All these years,

364
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,280
I've always wanted

365
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:10,590
a child of our own.

366
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:12,790
Our child, Xian.

367
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,320
Yue, tell me,

368
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:18,030
is the child mine?

369
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:25,350
Is the child mine?

370
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:32,880
The Zhou family

371
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:34,840
has been passed down
for eight generations.

372
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,030
It cannot end

373
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:39,030
with me.

374
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,520
The child is mine, isn't he?

375
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:46,960
Isn't he?

376
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:52,150
Is the child yours?

377
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:55,760
Don't you know the answer?

378
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:57,400
All these years,

379
00:16:58,350 --> 00:16:59,230
besides me,

380
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:01,200
of your legal wife,

381
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:01,960
and those women

382
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:03,320
you secretly keep,

383
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,520
which got pregnant?

384
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:05,520
Why don't you think

385
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:06,920
maybe it's you who are incapable?

386
00:17:12,070 --> 00:17:14,070
Help!

387
00:17:14,070 --> 00:17:15,000
You shameless woman!

388
00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:15,880
Help!

389
00:17:16,950 --> 00:17:18,110
Help!

390
00:17:18,590 --> 00:17:19,590
I'll kill you!

391
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,230
You shameless woman!

392
00:17:23,430 --> 00:17:25,230
Help!

393
00:17:25,350 --> 00:17:26,470
Stop!

394
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:35,400
You all...

395
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:37,040
You were eavesdropping?

396
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,920
Is what she said true?

397
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:41,760
You shameless woman.

398
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:44,040
She's just talking nonsense.

399
00:17:45,310 --> 00:17:46,350
How can you believe her?

400
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:49,880
Yes,

401
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:52,830
I am indeed shameless,

402
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:55,470
because of you,

403
00:17:55,470 --> 00:17:57,280
this hypocritical, selfish scholar

404
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,280
who has bewitched me.

405
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,830
I ignored my father's opposition,

406
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:03,760
supporting your studies and exams,

407
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,560
and spending money
to pave the way for you.

408
00:18:06,310 --> 00:18:07,310
But you?

409
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,280
Once you gained your official status,

410
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,230
you quickly married
a lady from a good family.

411
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:15,230
For you, I willingly became a concubine.

412
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:17,160
I went to the incense hall

413
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:19,070
to pray for a child,

414
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,190
but I was sullied by someone else.

415
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:26,190
This led to Niu Dali

416
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:27,590
having leverage over me.

417
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:29,710
He kept

418
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:31,590
harassing and threatening me.

419
00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:34,760
So you admit to colluding with Niu Dali

420
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:36,400
to frame Mrs. Zhou for infidelity?

421
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:38,760
Yes,

422
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:40,350
but that was because

423
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:42,110
I believed his lies.

424
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:44,520
He kept telling me

425
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:47,520
that he wanted to elevate my status,

426
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:48,880
but he was struggling to find

427
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,310
a reason to divorce.

428
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:53,590
To act rashly would only bring scandal.

429
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:57,920
I've come to trust him.

430
00:18:58,470 --> 00:18:59,800
Since you want a reason,

431
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,920
I'll give you one.

432
00:19:02,110 --> 00:19:02,800
But I've been sincere

433
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,280
with you.

434
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:06,710
Now you're heartless.

435
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,680
My love has been wasted.

436
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:12,710
If you really loved and protected me,

437
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:14,000
why did you

438
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,230
betray me and marry her?

439
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:18,110
Is that just because she's the daughter
of an official,

440
00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:20,710
who could help you advance,

441
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:23,190
while I'm just the daughter
of a merchant?

442
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:24,830
Zhou Xian,

443
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,040
you keep deceiving me,

444
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,590
making me compromise.

445
00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:30,110
You said one day

446
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:31,950
I'd be your only wife.

447
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:34,280
I believed it all.

448
00:19:34,430 --> 00:19:35,950
Now it all feels like a lie,

449
00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:36,760
just deception,

450
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:38,160
all of it fake.

451
00:19:38,430 --> 00:19:39,800
Zhou Xian,

452
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,950
you're nothing but a fraud.

453
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:53,470
Xue Wenyin.

454
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:59,350
I was too foolish.

455
00:20:00,430 --> 00:20:02,040
I was so focused on competing with you,

456
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:05,280
thinking that if I brought you down,

457
00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:08,280
I'd win.

458
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,520
But I never saw

459
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:13,800
his true nature.

460
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:15,640
He...

461
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:17,040
He

462
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:18,310
is incapable of loving anyone.

463
00:20:18,310 --> 00:20:19,470
He only loves himself.

464
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:20,760
Shut up!

465
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,800
I want to divorce you!

466
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:24,560
I want to divorce you.

467
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:25,310
Divorce me then.

468
00:20:25,310 --> 00:20:25,760
You want to divorce me?

469
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,160
I don't want to be with you anymore.

470
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:30,560
Arrest her!

471
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:32,830
Cai,

472
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,800
bring this murderer to justice!

473
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:35,160
I didn't...

474
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:36,000
Arrest her!

475
00:20:36,350 --> 00:20:37,160
I didn't!

476
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:37,920
I didn't kill anyone!

477
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:39,110
I really didn't!

478
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:40,160
Stop your nonsense!

479
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:41,350
Didn't you

480
00:20:41,350 --> 00:20:42,710
hire those two people?

481
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:44,830
If you didn't kill him,

482
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,950
why are you nervous?

483
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,470
Why did you
want to destroy the evidence?

484
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,230
It was him, Zhou Xian!

485
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:53,110
Zhou Xian told me to find someone

486
00:20:53,110 --> 00:20:54,640
to get rid of the body quickly.

487
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:56,430
I was just afraid

488
00:20:56,430 --> 00:20:57,560
that the secret of the incense hall
would be exposed,

489
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:59,590
and I didn't want you
to investigate further.

490
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:01,950
I really didn't kill him!

491
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:03,800
If I had that courage,

492
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:04,950
I would have killed him long ago.

493
00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:07,000
How could he keep blackmailing me?

494
00:21:14,430 --> 00:21:15,230
Mr. Zhou,

495
00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:17,760
we've checked everything needed.

496
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:19,110
Let's call it a day for today.

497
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:21,430
What did you say?

498
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:22,950
You...

499
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:23,920
You won't take

500
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:25,040
this murderer away?

501
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:27,640
The case isn't closed yet.

502
00:21:28,590 --> 00:21:30,350
For now, let her stay in the mansion,

503
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:31,800
and just make sure
she doesn't move around.

504
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:39,760
Then I'm leaving.

505
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:43,760
What kind of reasoning is this?

506
00:21:43,950 --> 00:21:45,800
We don't have enough evidence,
so we can't arrest her.

507
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,070
Cai.

508
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:49,880
You and your men go back first,

509
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:50,880
and wait for my news.

510
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:52,350
Okay.

511
00:21:52,590 --> 00:21:53,400
Officer.

512
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:58,590
Madam.

513
00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:14,070
Blaming me won't help.

514
00:22:14,590 --> 00:22:16,230
She definitely has a motive.

515
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:17,680
But where's the weapon?

516
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:18,800
Where is it?

517
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:20,310
She refuses to confess.

518
00:22:20,310 --> 00:22:21,800
We need physical evidence.

519
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:23,230
Otherwise,
Magistrate Han won't close the case.

520
00:22:23,230 --> 00:22:23,760
If we can't

521
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:24,950
find the weapon,

522
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:26,310
we won't be able to do anything.

523
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,280
We need both witnesses
and physical evidence

524
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:29,190
to close the case.

525
00:22:30,430 --> 00:22:31,470
Don't rush.

526
00:22:31,710 --> 00:22:32,920
Think carefully

527
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:33,760
and see if there are

528
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:35,310
any clues we've missed.

529
00:22:40,950 --> 00:22:42,590
Is there anything I can do?

530
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,110
Madam, since you're involved,

531
00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:46,110
it's not convenient.

532
00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:47,800
Just leave it to us.

533
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:54,880
We checked the wound

534
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:55,830
on Niu Dali's head.

535
00:22:55,950 --> 00:22:57,310
It was caused by a blunt object.

536
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
The injury isn't big,

537
00:22:59,230 --> 00:23:00,920
about the size of a fist.

538
00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:02,230
But it's somewhat heavy.

539
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,640
What do you think it could be?

540
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:09,830
A inkstone?

541
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:12,350
No.

542
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:15,000
Yue can't read much.

543
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:15,920
There's no inkstone

544
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:17,160
in her room.

545
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:19,710
A vase?

546
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:21,680
No.

547
00:23:22,230 --> 00:23:23,280
Vases break easily.

548
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:24,680
Besides leaving bruises,

549
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:26,280
it would have cut the skin.

550
00:23:38,110 --> 00:23:39,230
Could it be...

551
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:42,800
An incense burner?

552
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:45,040
Let's search her room

553
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:45,830
tomorrow.

554
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:47,000
If we find it,

555
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:48,160
we can close the case.

556
00:24:18,110 --> 00:24:18,920
Who's there?

557
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,160
Wenyin.

558
00:24:28,110 --> 00:24:29,310
It's really you.

559
00:24:31,350 --> 00:24:32,040
Why won't you

560
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:33,350
arrest her?

561
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,830
She hasn't confessed to the murder.

562
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:36,280
Plus, we still don't have

563
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:37,760
direct witness or physical evidence.

564
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:39,560
Murder is a capital offense;

565
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:41,280
no one would admit to it easily.

566
00:24:42,430 --> 00:24:43,950
You should take her back
and interrogate her strictly.

567
00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:45,160
I don't believe she won't confess.

568
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,400
But I think

569
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,310
she was speaking the truth just now.

570
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,070
You...

571
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:50,710
It's ridiculous.

572
00:24:53,110 --> 00:24:54,520
You can't be feeling sorry for her

573
00:24:54,590 --> 00:24:55,800
and want to protect her?

574
00:24:57,590 --> 00:24:58,520
If she wanted to kill him,

575
00:24:58,520 --> 00:24:59,590
she would have done it already.

576
00:25:00,310 --> 00:25:01,800
Being forced to let him stay
in the mansion

577
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:02,830
is riskier.

578
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:05,040
My instincts tell me

579
00:25:05,950 --> 00:25:07,310
the real murderer is someone else.

580
00:25:08,310 --> 00:25:10,000
Alright, then tell me,

581
00:25:10,230 --> 00:25:11,160
who is the murderer?

582
00:25:13,310 --> 00:25:14,470
If Yue goes to jail,

583
00:25:15,590 --> 00:25:17,310
who do you think will benefit?

584
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:22,070
Are you suspecting Wenyin?

585
00:25:22,590 --> 00:25:23,800
How could that be?

586
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,640
I've figured it out.

587
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:32,160
From the start,

588
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,470
you never intended to help me.

589
00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:37,640
So you're this malicious.

590
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:39,950
How about we make a bet?

591
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:41,680
What kind of bet?

592
00:25:42,590 --> 00:25:44,280
Do you dare to play along with me?

593
00:25:54,110 --> 00:25:56,000
You figured I would eavesdrop,

594
00:25:56,350 --> 00:25:58,160
so you're deliberately
making up a weapon

595
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,800
to trap me, right?

596
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:03,560
Sorry.

597
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,560
The victim
had slight scratch marks on the neck,

598
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:08,350
and the back of his head
had a heavy blow.

599
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:10,110
But none were fatal.

600
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:12,470
The victim was strangled.

601
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:13,470
It wasn't a suicide.

602
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:15,190
Because usually, hangings

603
00:26:15,190 --> 00:26:17,160
show marks in the front of the neck.

604
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:18,760
But the victim has marks

605
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:19,640
all around.

606
00:26:20,110 --> 00:26:20,920
This shows

607
00:26:21,950 --> 00:26:23,350
that someone strangled him.

608
00:26:28,590 --> 00:26:30,310
I did kill Niu Dali.

609
00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:32,830
Wenyin, why did you?

610
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:37,640
There must be
some misunderstanding in this,

611
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:38,470
right?

612
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:41,950
You must have your reasons.

613
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:44,110
Right?

614
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:51,590
Madam, things have come to this.

615
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:53,950
Please tell the truth.

616
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:58,680
I know

617
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:01,680
that Yue bribed Niu Dali

618
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:03,160
to frame me.

619
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:06,760
But I don't have solid evidence.

620
00:27:07,950 --> 00:27:09,950
Zhou Xian won't believe me.

621
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:12,640
So I thought

622
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:17,350
now that Yue could bribe Niu Dali,

623
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:19,680
if I offered him more,

624
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:21,310
maybe

625
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:23,470
Niu Dali would tell the truth

626
00:27:23,470 --> 00:27:24,680
in front of Zhou Xian.

627
00:27:28,110 --> 00:27:29,800
I was too naive.

628
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:48,310
Miss Liu

629
00:27:48,310 --> 00:27:49,680
has traced it back to me.

630
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:51,160
You need to find a way.

631
00:27:52,590 --> 00:27:54,520
Don't worry; I have a plan.

632
00:27:55,230 --> 00:27:56,040
What's the plan?

633
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:57,400
Tomorrow morning,

634
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:58,830
ask the steward for leave,

635
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:00,400
telling him your father is seriously ill

636
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:01,470
and you need to go home.

637
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:04,070
If you're not here,

638
00:28:04,470 --> 00:28:05,710
they won't be able to investigate.

639
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:09,280
Are you trying to get rid of me?

640
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:10,680
No!

641
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:11,590
I'm right here.

642
00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:12,160
Where would I go?

643
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,280
How could I possibly get rid of you?

644
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:14,680
I'm just telling you to go back

645
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:15,710
and lay low for a while.

646
00:28:15,830 --> 00:28:16,880
Once this blows over,

647
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:17,710
you can come back.

648
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:19,880
That's different

649
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:20,830
from what you said before.

650
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:22,310
You should offer me more money.

651
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:28,400
Give them to me.

652
00:28:35,110 --> 00:28:36,400
This is better.

653
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:15,560
Who's there?

654
00:29:18,110 --> 00:29:18,760
Who?

655
00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:21,230
Come out!

656
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:31,040
I heard

657
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:32,640
what you said.

658
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:38,310
I want to make a deal with you.

659
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:47,710
What kind of deal?

660
00:29:50,230 --> 00:29:52,230
How much is Yue paying you

661
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:53,560
to set me up?

662
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:55,400
If you agree

663
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:57,280
to tell the truth in front of Mr. Zhou,

664
00:29:57,710 --> 00:29:59,160
I'll give you double.

665
00:30:03,830 --> 00:30:04,800
Is this enough?

666
00:30:14,070 --> 00:30:15,470
This little bit of money?

667
00:30:16,350 --> 00:30:17,880
You can keep it yourself.

668
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:19,800
I don't care.

669
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:21,680
Then how much do you want?

670
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:27,560
To be honest,

671
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:30,400
once Yue becomes the mistress
of the Zhou family,

672
00:30:30,950 --> 00:30:31,880
the Zhou family's money

673
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:34,640
will be at my disposal.

674
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:36,800
Be clear about this.

675
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:37,160
Let go.

676
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:38,070
How much do you want? Just say it.

677
00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:38,800
Let me go!

678
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:39,920
I'm asking how much you want!

679
00:30:40,470 --> 00:30:41,110
Let me go!

680
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:51,430
Madam!

681
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:57,190
You're still looking good.

682
00:30:57,310 --> 00:30:58,280
What do you want?

683
00:30:58,710 --> 00:31:00,350
I want to sleep with you

684
00:31:00,430 --> 00:31:01,350
and have some fun.

685
00:31:01,350 --> 00:31:02,430
Somebody!

686
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:07,760
You dare slap me?

687
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:08,800
Help!

688
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,040
You dare slap me?

689
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:14,160
I want to sleep with you.

690
00:31:14,470 --> 00:31:15,800
I'll help you

691
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:17,190
have a baby today.

692
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:18,470
Then you can

693
00:31:18,470 --> 00:31:20,350
compete for my favor with Yue.

694
00:31:20,430 --> 00:31:21,280
Help!

695
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:28,000
You dare kick me?

696
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:28,680
Help!

697
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:55,110
Niu Dali!

698
00:31:57,590 --> 00:31:58,470
Niu Dali!

699
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:04,880
Someone!

700
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:15,070
Zhou Xian and Yue insulted me.

701
00:32:16,190 --> 00:32:17,000
I endured it.

702
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:20,470
But Niu Dali,

703
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:23,110
a mere servant,

704
00:32:23,110 --> 00:32:24,400
dared to insult me too.

705
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:26,680
How can I endure this?

706
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,560
So I muddled through

707
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:02,830
and killed Niu Dali.

708
00:33:04,230 --> 00:33:05,230
I didn't expect...

709
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:07,800
I didn't expect

710
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:09,310
that she'd use Niu Dali's death

711
00:33:09,310 --> 00:33:10,520
to make a fuss.

712
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,190
It's okay.

713
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:20,950
Since she

714
00:33:20,950 --> 00:33:23,000
can frame me,

715
00:33:25,710 --> 00:33:27,760
I can pay her back

716
00:33:28,430 --> 00:33:30,110
in kind.

717
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:33,280
So you misled us,

718
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:34,590
making us think

719
00:33:34,590 --> 00:33:36,350
she's the real murderer.

720
00:33:36,350 --> 00:33:37,800
I had no choice.

721
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:39,920
My father has passed away.

722
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:41,710
In the Zhou Mansion,

723
00:33:42,230 --> 00:33:44,070
I'm living in such humiliation.

724
00:33:45,310 --> 00:33:46,920
It's better to end it all.

725
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:57,710
A life for a life.

726
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:00,560
Take me with you.

727
00:34:05,350 --> 00:34:06,160
Miss Luo,

728
00:34:07,110 --> 00:34:10,040
what will Wenyin be charged with?

729
00:34:13,670 --> 00:34:14,630
She is guilty,

730
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:16,470
but not death.

731
00:34:17,870 --> 00:34:19,630
After all,
Niu Dali attempted to rape her first.

732
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:31,560
Wenyin,

733
00:34:33,470 --> 00:34:35,320
is it worth it

734
00:34:36,150 --> 00:34:37,080
for someone like Zhou Xian?

735
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:48,390
Yes.

736
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:51,760
Is it worth it?

737
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:56,040
Wenyin!

738
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:41,910
You won.

739
00:36:43,950 --> 00:36:44,670
No,

740
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:46,670
there are no winners.

741
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:48,710
We all lose.

742
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:51,120
Actually,

743
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:56,560
you, Wenyin, and I

744
00:36:57,670 --> 00:36:59,120
are all the same.

745
00:36:59,910 --> 00:37:01,840
What we want in love and marriage

746
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:04,760
is to have someone
to share our lives with,

747
00:37:05,230 --> 00:37:06,910
without a third party involved.

748
00:37:07,670 --> 00:37:08,430
We're unwilling to get caught up

749
00:37:08,430 --> 00:37:09,800
in all these entanglements

750
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:10,910
and lose ourselves.

751
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,430
Otherwise, we'd rather die.

752
00:37:17,230 --> 00:37:18,280
So, Miss Liu,

753
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,040
you can rest assured.

754
00:37:20,630 --> 00:37:23,080
I'll keep my promise to you.

755
00:37:25,190 --> 00:37:26,360
If there's nothing else,

756
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:27,910
I'll take my leave.

757
00:37:29,710 --> 00:37:30,520
Wait a moment.

758
00:37:37,710 --> 00:37:38,520
Earlier,

759
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:40,950
I misunderstood you deeply.

760
00:37:42,950 --> 00:37:44,080
After this incident,

761
00:37:45,670 --> 00:37:47,430
I truly understand you now.

762
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:49,870
If you don't want to leave,

763
00:37:50,150 --> 00:37:51,150
just stay.

764
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:55,870
Thank you for trusting me.

765
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:58,120
But after this,

766
00:37:58,600 --> 00:37:59,760
my mind is made up.

767
00:38:00,950 --> 00:38:02,430
I'll leave the yamen soon,

768
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:03,800
and leave Linfen.

769
00:38:05,150 --> 00:38:06,320
Where do you plan to go?

770
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:10,760
Anywhere I want to go.

771
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:13,760
To see the spring river meet the sea,

772
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,560
and the bright moon
rising with the tide.

773
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:17,670
To watch autumn winds
sweep the Weihe River,

774
00:38:18,430 --> 00:38:19,670
and leaves falling all over Chang'an.

775
00:38:20,630 --> 00:38:21,470
To the frontier,

776
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:23,430
to see the smoke rising in the desert,

777
00:38:23,430 --> 00:38:24,560
and the sun setting over the river.

778
00:38:25,150 --> 00:38:27,320
There are so many possibilities.

779
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:30,840
You live like the wind,

780
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:33,600
full of dreams,

781
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:37,230
free and easygoing.

782
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:39,710
And I...

783
00:38:40,870 --> 00:38:42,230
I'm like a tree.

784
00:38:43,230 --> 00:38:44,800
In this life,

785
00:38:45,430 --> 00:38:46,320
I can only

786
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:47,870
to guard this piece of land.

787
00:38:48,950 --> 00:38:50,230
So what I can do

788
00:38:51,190 --> 00:38:52,800
is to hold on tightly

789
00:38:53,150 --> 00:38:54,710
to the person in front of me,

790
00:38:55,430 --> 00:38:56,430

791

792
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:00,470
grabbing hold of the ground beneath it.

793
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:04,910
For you,

794
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:06,600
this is not just

795
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:08,280
a matter of parental arrangement
or matchmaking.

796
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:11,560
It's also your own choice.

797
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:18,670
Even you can see that.

798
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:21,560
But he has no idea.

799
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:24,150
If you truly like Magistrate Han,

800
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:26,760
why not just tell him directly?

801
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,800
No one is truly free in this world.

802
00:39:30,710 --> 00:39:32,000
Everyone is to some extent

803
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,150
controlled by fate.

804
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:37,150
So we can't give up our initiative

805
00:39:37,910 --> 00:39:39,670
or our right to choose.

806
00:39:40,190 --> 00:39:41,000
Otherwise,

807
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:43,870
we'll really be bowing to fate.

808

If we hadn't met

809
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:50,390
in this way,

810
00:39:51,710 --> 00:39:53,390
perhaps we could have become confidants.

811
00:39:55,870 --> 00:39:56,840
Life is long,

812
00:39:57,670 --> 00:40:00,120

she and I are quite similar.
