[Episode 28]

4
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:36,720
Wuniang's death…

5
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,080
Of course they killed her.

6
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:43,160
What am I?

7
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:46,040
Just a puppet.

8
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:47,760
They tell me what to do,

9
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:48,680
and I do it.

10
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,190
All these years,

11
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:04,000
I've tried every way to redeem myself,

12
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,720
but failed in the end.

13
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:09,630
It was all arranged by him
from the shadows.

14
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:15,600
No.

15
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:18,830
Jin Nang.

16
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,910
They've calculated everything,

17
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:22,830
but they never expected

18
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:25,240
you'd use the magistrate
to remove low status.

19
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:27,440
They asked me to bribe the matchmaker

20
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,520
to bring you back.

21
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,390
But in the end...

22
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:32,550
But...

23
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,240
But in the end,

24
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:37,600
all I brought back

25
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:39,750
was Jin Miaocui.

26
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:44,830
You can never make

27
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:45,910
but always break.

28
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:49,190
I've tried everything.

29
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,240
I bribed that matchmaker,

30
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,110
but she just

31
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:53,800
dared not lay a hand on Jin Nang.

32
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,550
She tortured Jin Miaocui all day

33
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:57,080
just to fulfill her duty.

34
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,160
I had no choice

35
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:00,110
but to go get her myself.

36
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:02,440
But that's the yamen after all.

37
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,550
The magistrate was protecting her.

38
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,830
What do you expect me to do?

39
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:08,080
Are you trying to follow in

40
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,470
the footsteps of the late Wuniang?

41
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:13,440
No.

42
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,670
She's Master's woman.

43
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:17,750
Master keeps her in Mingke House

44
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:20,080
just to break her spirit.

45
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:23,190
Now she has run away.

46
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:26,320
You go to explain to Master yourself.

47
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:29,520
Mr. Li, please.

48
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:30,360
I know

49
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,160
Master's temper.

50
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,160
Please help me this time.

51
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,600
Help me get through it.

52
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,720
I'm begging you.

53
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:39,600
Do you really think I can do that?

54
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:43,190
It was you who let her
escape to the yamen.

55
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:45,670
Think about it.

56
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,720
Think about how you'll be buried.

57
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,240
Who is it?

58
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:04,910
Who are you?

59
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,030
I'm Mulan.

60
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:08,800
What did you hear just now?

61
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:12,550
Go away.

62
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:19,920
Train her well.

63
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:22,550
Maybe she can help you

64
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:23,350
get through this.

65
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,320
Don't you think

66
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,230
she looks a bit like her?

67
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:33,920
She does resemble Jin Nang a bit.

68
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:35,550
After Jin Nang,

69
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:37,200
she is Master's favorite

70
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,270
now.

71
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:41,200
I'm leaving her in your hands.

72
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:43,760
Train her in speech, behavior and dress.

73
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:45,160
The more she resembles Jin Nang,

74
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:47,550
the more likely you are
to get through it.

75
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:48,440
Otherwise...

76
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,230
I understand.

77
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:53,200
I'll definitely
train her well for Master.

78
00:04:57,350 --> 00:04:58,160
Then?

79
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:00,040
Say it.

80
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:04,760
And then I

81
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,160
noticed that Jin Miaocui

82
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,670
was getting close to Mulan.

83
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:09,270
That aroused my suspicion.

84
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:11,720
You came to see Jin Miaocui
before the New Year.

85
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,550
If I hadn't burst in

86
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:14,600
and interrupted you,

87
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,070
maybe

88
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:18,350
you would have known the truth by then.

89
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:19,720
After that,

90
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:20,550
I sent someone

91
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:22,440
to keep a constant eye on Jin Miaocui.

92
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:24,830
She might have noticed,

93
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,230
so she asked Mian Ao

94
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:28,160
to send a letter to the yamen.

95
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,110
I stopped Mian Ao.

96
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:32,640
After reading the letter, I found out

97
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:35,830
the eavesdropper that day

98
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:37,160
was indeed Jin Miaocui.

99
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,510
I told Mr. Li about this...

100
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:42,510
I told Mr. Li about it.

101
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:44,070
He wanted to kill her immediately.

102
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:46,510
It was me...

103
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:47,790
Jin Nang, it was me...

104
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:49,670
I risked my life to protect them.

105
00:05:49,670 --> 00:05:51,230
Then you were so kind-hearted.

106
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:53,950
You put Miaocui in the side courtyard,

107
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:55,070
subjecting her

108
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:55,790
to endless humiliation.

109
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:57,480
Aren't you afraid of going to hell?

110
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:58,790
I...

111
00:05:58,790 --> 00:05:59,670
Since you threw Miss Jin

112
00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:00,600
in the side courtyard,

113
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:02,320
why did you kill her?

114
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:04,320
I can't protect them anymore.

115
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,760
After you came,

116
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:07,880
you wanted to see her and redeem her.

117
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:08,550
I knew

118
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:09,070
Jin Miaocui

119
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:10,720
must have sent you message.

120
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:17,830
Madam Yu.

121
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:20,510
What has Jin Miaocui done now?

122
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:21,640
Madam,

123
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:22,790
a delivery man

124
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:24,440
who saw Jin Miaocui yesterday,

125
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:26,200
came again.

126
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:27,790
I kept an eye out,

127
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,510
hiding behind the door

128
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:30,830
to overheard a bit.

129
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:32,110
It seems that

130
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:33,600
he sent a letter for her

131
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,480
and came back for money.

132
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:40,600
I know.

133
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:44,230
Jin Miaocui should have died long ago.

134
00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:48,040
Miaocui.

135
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:50,950
It's been a while.

136
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:02,270
Wait for another half an hour.

137
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:03,920
If the man inside hasn't come out yet,

138
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:04,950
you go to call him out.

139
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:07,640
But...

140
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,070
Something's wrong.

141
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:11,230
Oh no, something's wrong.

142
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,200
What happened?

143
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:13,920
What is it?

144
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,230
Let's go check.

145
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:17,040
What happened?

146
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,160
It's nothing, go back.

147
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:18,830
Please go back.

148
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:19,950
Let's go.

149
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:21,720
Go.

150
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:36,950
You go to kill her.

151
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:39,160
I...

152
00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:42,550
I can't.

153
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,910
I'm sorry.

154
00:08:43,910 --> 00:08:45,760
Jin Nang.

155
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:47,440
I'm sorry.

156
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,590
Jin Nang, I don't want to die.

157
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:49,670
I beg you.

158
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,640
I don't want to end up like Wuniang.

159
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:52,880
I saw

160
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,110
how Wuniang died.

161
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:55,840
The day Wuniang died,

162
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:56,590
I saw

163
00:08:56,590 --> 00:08:58,320
the young head of the Qin family.

164
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,350
Wuniang's death

165
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,840
was orchestrated by him.

166
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,960
Even now, when I think of his smile,

167
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:06,280
I feel...

168
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,000
Jin Nang.

169
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:11,960
They made me to do all of this.

170
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:14,230
If I didn't listen to them,

171
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,840
I would have died

172
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:16,710
even worse than Wuniang.

173
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:18,350
Please, I don't want to die.

174
00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:20,590
Please save me.

175
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,910
You devil woman.
How dare you beg for mercy?

176
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,520
Jin Nang.

177
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:32,520
Save me.

178
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:32,910
Get away.

179
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:33,550
Save me.

180
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:37,790
I don't want to die.

The Qin family Madam Yu just mentioned,

184
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,520
is it the same Qin family as Qin Yi's?

185
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,230
I always thought

186
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,590
I couldn't escape

187
00:10:12,590 --> 00:10:13,640

all of this

193
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:25,760
was being manipulated
by him from the shadows.

194
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:29,910
You don't understand.

195
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,520
Why did he do this?

196
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:34,790
Why?

197
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:37,670
I don't understand.

198
00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:39,790
We'll ask him face to face.

199
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:43,440
After we finish this,

200
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:44,640
we'll go back to Taiyuan

201
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:46,550
and confront him.

202
00:10:48,110 --> 00:10:48,910
Mr. Qi.

203
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:50,760
Did you catch him?

204
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:51,960
I chased him

205
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,150
all the way

206
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,350
into a bank,

207
00:10:54,590 --> 00:10:55,520
but I didn't find him

208
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:56,230
in there.

209
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:57,440
He escaped.

210
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,670
We've interrogated Mr. Li.

211
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:04,790
He denied everything Madam Yu said.

212
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:05,840
He insisted

213
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,550
the bank was just robbed yesterday.

214
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:08,960
He never saw

215
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,320
or knew Que Si.

216
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:14,030
Issue an arrest warrant immediately

217
00:11:14,030 --> 00:11:15,150
for Que Si.

218
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:17,280
But until Que Si is caught,

219
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:18,440
we have no evidence

220
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:20,350
against Mr. Li.

221
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:29,760
Since he runs a bank and a casino,

222
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,110
there must be some

223
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:32,350
dirty deeds going on.

224
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:34,640
If we can find evidence,

225
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:36,590
there will definitely be a way
to bring him to justice.

226
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,960
We have to plan this carefully.

227
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,110
It can't be done...

228
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,230
Thank you for your kindness.

229
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:47,520
Just leave it at that for now.

230
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:48,200
I already know

231
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,520
who is behind this.

232
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:50,790
I will settle

233
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:52,400
all the old and new scores with him.

234
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:55,280
Now that Miaocui has died far from home,

235
00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:57,030
I'm her only family.

236
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:59,150
In her lifetime,

237
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:01,320
she didn't live with dignity.

238
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,790
I want to make it up to her.

239
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:05,880
What do you want to do?

240
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:09,670
I want to release
Miaocui's soul from purgatory.

241
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,110
I want to give her a grand funeral.

242
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:16,110
The murder of Jin Miaocui

243
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:17,910
has become known all over the town.

244
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:19,710
Everyone is rubbernecking now.

245
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:21,790
Holding a grand funeral at this time

246
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:23,520
will only bring you controversy.

247
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:24,280
That's right.

248
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,150
Leave it

249
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:26,350
to us.

250
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:28,080
I'll send someone to bury her properly.

251
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,470
That's why

252
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:31,960
I want to hold this funeral even more.

253
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,350
I want to clear her name.

254
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:36,030
She is a performer.

255
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:38,080
What's the use of clearing her name?

256
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:40,110
Does where she comes from

257
00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:40,520
define

258
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:41,840
who she is?

259
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,320
Alright, so we step back.

260
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:46,350
You hold a funeral for her

261
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:47,400
in what capacity?

262
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:50,150
Friend.

263
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:51,440
But...

264
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:53,840
If you do that,

265
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:56,520
your old identity
will be known to everyone.

266
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:58,470
You've finally removed low status,

267
00:12:58,520 --> 00:12:59,880
you can't get involved

268
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:01,110
with Mingke House again.

269
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,550
I was born from the squalid mud,

270
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,840
why should I care its dirtiness?

271
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:14,880
Then we'll do it in my name.

272
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:16,960
Personally,

273
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:18,230
Luo Shu's friend

274
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:19,150
is my friend.

275
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:21,840
It's natural to hold a funeral
for a friend.

276
00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:23,400
Officially,

277
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:25,150
Jin Miaocui was the victim.

278
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,350
Why is it

279
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:29,350
that the killer

280
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:30,670
can openly do business,

281
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:31,230
while the killed

282
00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:32,670
must be buried secretly?

283
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:48,620
[The spirit tablet
of my deceased friend Jin Miaocui]

284
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,350
Didn't you say you were leaving?

285
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,440
You're just going
to freeze and starve here.

286
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,640
Where else can I go?

287
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:29,470
Still smiling? Cold, huh?

288
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:31,150
Come here.

289
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:42,880
Luo Shu.

290
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:46,400
Miaocui.

291
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:50,960
Come here.

292
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,080
Luo Shu.

293
00:14:57,670 --> 00:14:58,440
I heard a secret

294
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,760
about you.

295
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:01,350
I have to tell you.

296
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,230
For all these years,

297
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,400
you've tried to
leave Mingke House many times,

298
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:07,320
but always failed in the end.

299
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,470
Actually someone has been
secretly hindering you.

300
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:13,320
That person seems to be very powerful.

301
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:15,110
Even Madam is afraid of him.

302
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:17,280
I didn't know who it was,

303
00:15:17,670 --> 00:15:19,520
but I was afraid you might be set up.

304
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:20,710
So,

305
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:22,230
I investigated secretly.

306
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:23,880
Sure enough,

307
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:24,960
A girl named Mulan

308
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,200
came to Mingke House.

309
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:28,280
She was sent by that person.

310
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:30,470
I deliberately befriended her.

311
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,000
She told me

312
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,760
the Master's name is Qin Yi.

313
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:43,150
Miaocui.

314
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:47,200
I'm sorry.

315
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,960
When I took you away from Mingke House,

316
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:53,110
I didn't consider

317
00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:54,110
your feelings at all.

318
00:15:55,670 --> 00:15:57,000
I didn't realize

319
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:59,670
how tough it was for you.

320
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,840
Did you decide to go back

321
00:16:04,350 --> 00:16:07,030
to not hold me back?

322
00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:11,550
I'm sorry.

323
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,230
It's all my fault.

324
00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:20,760
I often wonder,

325
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,110
if we had never met

326
00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:23,590
in the beginning,

327
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:26,590
maybe all of this

328
00:16:26,590 --> 00:16:28,230
would never have happened.

329
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:31,000
If I had a choice,

330
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:33,350
I'd rather not know

331
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:34,590
who that person is.

332
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:37,840
I'd rather bear this sin

333
00:16:38,590 --> 00:16:39,840
for you,

334
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:42,840
as long as you can be alive.

335
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,200
Luo Shu.

336
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:50,590
There is one thing

337
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:53,320
I regret the least in my life,

338
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:56,030
which is becoming your best friend.

339
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:59,230
Actually, last time we met

340
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:00,320
wasn't pleasant.

341
00:17:01,590 --> 00:17:04,160
But you were not mad at me, right?

342
00:17:05,350 --> 00:17:07,070
Do you know how much I envy you?

343
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:10,560
I wish I could be as brave as you.

344
00:17:11,070 --> 00:17:13,800
Unfortunately, I'm not you.

345
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,430
But going back to Mingke House

346
00:17:18,430 --> 00:17:20,040
was my own decision.

347
00:17:20,070 --> 00:17:21,560
You can't blame yourself anymore.

348
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:22,430
Do you hear me?

349
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,110
Although it's not a nice place,

350
00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:26,800
I, Jin Miaocui,

351
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:28,590
can support myself.

352
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:30,880
You are like a swan
ready to spread its wings and fly,

353
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:34,070
while I'm just a canary.

354
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:36,230
Without that birdcage,

355
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:37,160
I don't know

356
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,710
how to survive.

357
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:42,070
In the future,

358
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:43,800
you're going to fly freely

359
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:46,110
and also see

360
00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:47,830
the beautiful scenery of this world
for me.

361
00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:54,950
I promise you.

362
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,160
From now on,

363
00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:01,190
I'll see all the beautiful sights
of this world

364
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:04,110
for both of us,

365
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:07,920
and I'll live well, in a happy way.

366
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:11,190
In our next life,

367
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,110
we'll still be best friends.

[The spirit tablet

[In memory of Jin Miaocui]

370
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:08,760
So she is

371
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:10,520
the top performer at Mingke House.

372
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:12,470

375
00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:15,680
I won't let her serve me.

376

After two months of treatment,

380
00:20:59,350 --> 00:21:00,950
her condition has improved a lot,

381

but she still needs to rest and recover.

382
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:05,000
How much longer do I have to lie down?

383
00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:06,640
I've been lying down for so long.

384
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,800
You got stagnation of liver qi
and the anxiety affected your heart,

385
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,230
plus overexertion

386
00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:11,350
has damaged your internal organs.

387
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:12,800
It's fortunate enough

388
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,520
to just got a serious illness.

389
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:16,230
You can't rush it.

390
00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:20,160
Make sure she takes the medicine
on time

391
00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:23,880
and rests properly.

392
00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:25,470
Goodbye.

393
00:21:25,470 --> 00:21:26,400
Thanks, doctor.

394
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:27,880
Thank you.

395
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:39,920
Why are you up?

396
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:41,110
Are you just ignoring

397
00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:42,160
what the doctor said?

398
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:44,190
I feel better today.

399
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:45,560
I have some energy too.

400
00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:52,280
You're in good condition today.

401
00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:54,880
So can I

402
00:21:54,950 --> 00:21:56,590
have some meat dishes?

403
00:21:56,590 --> 00:21:57,310
No.

404
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:58,640
Doctor said

405
00:21:58,640 --> 00:21:59,880
you should have some light dishes.

406
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:00,880
I've been sick for so long,

407
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,430
eating light dishes every day.

408
00:22:02,430 --> 00:22:03,040
I might as well

409
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:04,190
become a nun.

410
00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:05,470
No, you can't.

411
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:09,040
Alright,

412
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:10,400
what do you want to eat?

413
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,680
I'll ask Lian Shu to buy for you.

414
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:15,110
I want to have

415
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:17,800
Fried Boiled Pork, chicken soup,

416
00:22:18,830 --> 00:22:21,430
deep-fried cake, and wheat noodles.

417
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,160
It's...

418
00:22:37,470 --> 00:22:38,760
Oh, no.

419
00:22:39,230 --> 00:22:41,190
How am I supposed to live?

420
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:45,190
This is...

421
00:22:47,710 --> 00:22:48,760
God of Locusts,

422
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:51,190
please don't do this to me.

423
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:53,920
Please leave my field.

424
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,400
Please.

425
00:22:57,230 --> 00:22:58,070
Sun.

426
00:22:58,310 --> 00:22:59,470
Come on, Sun.

427
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:00,520
Stop it.

428
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:01,710
Come with us.

429
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,400
We found the one
who angered God of Locusts.

430
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,350
Come with us.

431
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:05,590
Let's go.

432
00:23:06,830 --> 00:23:07,400
Go.

433
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:08,470
Go.

434
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:09,430
Go.

435
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:21,040
We must mobilize the farmers

436
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:22,070
to harvest the crops quickly.

437
00:23:23,190 --> 00:23:24,470
Or the locust plague will spread,

438
00:23:24,710 --> 00:23:26,350
causing great losses to people.

439
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:30,710
Your Honor, look over there.

440
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:43,110
Eliminating locusts cannot be delayed.

441
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:45,190
We must act immediately.

442
00:23:45,310 --> 00:23:46,110
Eliminating locusts?

443
00:23:46,830 --> 00:23:47,880
People may not cooperate.

444
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:48,950
In their eyes,

445
00:23:48,950 --> 00:23:50,230
these locusts cannot be offended.

446
00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:51,310
Stupid.

447
00:23:51,950 --> 00:23:52,710
When I first took office here,

448
00:23:52,710 --> 00:23:54,190
I flipped through the county chronicles,

449
00:23:54,190 --> 00:23:56,280
and found that several
previous magistrates had led people

450
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:58,230
in sacrificing to the locusts.
That's ridiculous.

451
00:23:58,230 --> 00:23:58,880
That was true.

452
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,800
They held grand sacrifices
whenever there was a locust plague.

453
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:01,880
Over time,

454
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,830
locusts have become the God of Locusts.

455
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:05,310
Locusts are a great disaster.

456
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:06,800
How can they be treated like gods?

457
00:24:06,830 --> 00:24:07,430
People don't understand

458
00:24:07,430 --> 00:24:09,040
no matter how you explain to them.

459
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:10,560
Previous magistrates

460
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:11,950
had to follow the will of the people.

461
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:13,640
Otherwise it would be hard
for them to govern people.

462
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:15,070
What follow the will of the people?

463
00:24:15,590 --> 00:24:16,950
They just didn't want to take actions.

464
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:18,950
As an official in charge,

465
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,800
one should lead the people
on behalf of the emperor,

466
00:24:22,310 --> 00:24:23,400
showing benevolent governance.

467
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:24,710
How can one fail to
distinguish right from wrong

468
00:24:24,710 --> 00:24:25,760
and fool the common people?

469
00:24:27,110 --> 00:24:27,920
Your Honor.

470
00:24:29,590 --> 00:24:30,400
Your Honor.

471
00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:31,310
Your Honor.

472
00:24:31,310 --> 00:24:32,040
What happened?

473
00:24:33,190 --> 00:24:34,430
Your Honor.

474
00:24:34,430 --> 00:24:35,400
I brought two guys

475
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,400
to inspect the situation in the fields

476
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,160
near graves.

477
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:38,310
We found a group of farmers

478
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:39,160
digging up Jin Miaocui's grave.

479
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:42,040
Let's go check.

480
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:47,880
Everyone,

481
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:50,160
we're in trouble

482
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,160
because of

483
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:52,590
this woman's grand funeral.

484
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:53,800
Let's open the coffin,

485
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:54,880
pull her out and whip her body

486
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,040
to appease the anger
of the God of Locusts.

487
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:56,680
Yes.

488
00:24:59,000 --> 00:24:59,800
Let's do it.

489
00:25:00,430 --> 00:25:01,110
Lift it out.

490
00:25:01,110 --> 00:25:01,710
Stop.

491
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:02,760
Put the coffin down.

492
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:03,680
Stop!

493
00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:08,470
Your Honor, the God of Locusts is angry.

494
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:10,520
Please give the order
to remove the root of the disaster.

495
00:25:10,830 --> 00:25:11,680
Your Honor.

496
00:25:11,950 --> 00:25:13,560
Please do justice.

497
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:14,470
What God of Locusts?

498
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,070
What root of the disaster?

499
00:25:16,110 --> 00:25:17,280
That's absurd.

500
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:19,590
I'm telling you,

501
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,350
the only way

502
00:25:21,350 --> 00:25:22,110
to save your crops

503
00:25:22,110 --> 00:25:23,430
is to eliminate locusts
as soon as possible.

504
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:25,590
You dig up coffin

505
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:26,760
and cause trouble.

506
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:28,040
That's not tolerated by law.

507
00:25:30,350 --> 00:25:31,430
I see.

508
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:33,560
Those two people who buried this woman

509
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:35,070
have connections in the yamen.

510
00:25:35,590 --> 00:25:38,000
Are you going to act with partiality?

511
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:39,040
Yeah.

512
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:40,310
That's right.

513
00:25:40,310 --> 00:25:42,230
Why does a woman from Mingke House

514
00:25:42,230 --> 00:25:43,920
get such a grand burial?

515
00:25:44,190 --> 00:25:45,880
What they've done

516
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:47,350
is shameless and faceless,

517
00:25:47,470 --> 00:25:48,880
pissing the God of Locusts off.

518
00:25:49,110 --> 00:25:51,800
This is punishment for us in Linfen!

519
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:52,430
Yeah.

520
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:55,710
The yamen won't help us.

521
00:25:55,710 --> 00:25:57,040
We have to save ourselves.

522
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:57,760
Let's go.

523
00:25:57,830 --> 00:25:58,710
We'll help.

524
00:25:59,110 --> 00:26:00,110
Stop it.

525
00:26:00,110 --> 00:26:01,190
Don't be impulsive.

526
00:26:01,190 --> 00:26:01,950
Come on.

527
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,430
Listen to me.

528
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,000
Magistrate Han has no intention
of acting with partiality.

529
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,040
Calm down, listen to me.

530
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:07,310
The only way to solve the problem

531
00:26:07,310 --> 00:26:08,430
is to eliminate locusts.

532
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:10,000
Calm down.

533
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:10,760
Stop.

534
00:26:11,110 --> 00:26:12,110
What you're doing right now

535
00:26:12,110 --> 00:26:13,590
is meaningless.

536
00:26:13,950 --> 00:26:14,760
Listen to me.

537
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:15,560
Calm down.

538
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:17,430
The only way to solve the problem

539
00:26:17,430 --> 00:26:18,560
is to eliminate locusts.

540
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:26,470
What's wrong?

541
00:26:27,070 --> 00:26:28,430
You don't like these dishes?

542
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:34,800
I just suddenly thought of Miaocui.

543
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:36,680
It's all my fault.

544
00:26:37,230 --> 00:26:39,040
I haven't visited her for so long.

545
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:40,800
Tomorrow, I want to...

546
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:41,470
Tomorrow,

547
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:42,710
I'll go with you

548
00:26:42,710 --> 00:26:44,070
to visit Miss Jin's grave.

549
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:45,710
You can talk to her.

550
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:48,310
But,

551
00:26:48,830 --> 00:26:50,230
you can't be sad anymore.

552
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:52,520
Miss Jin is gone.

553
00:26:53,230 --> 00:26:54,560
You have to take care of yourself.

554
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:56,640
When all this is over,

555
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:57,830
we'll go back to Taiyuan.

556
00:26:59,190 --> 00:27:00,350
Leave this sad place behind.

557
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:04,070
Yes, go back to Taiyuan.

558
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:07,040
It's time to go back.

559
00:27:19,430 --> 00:27:20,230
Luo Shu.

560
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:23,920
I know what you're thinking.

561
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:25,920
About that great fire,

562
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,070
I can't say for sure

563
00:27:27,070 --> 00:27:28,470
that our family
had nothing to do with it.

564
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:29,920
But after I return to Taiyuan,

565
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:31,590
I'll definitely help you

566
00:27:31,590 --> 00:27:32,920
get to the bottom of this.

567
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:35,560
Whether it's the Qi family or Qin Yi,

568
00:27:36,110 --> 00:27:37,400
whoever the real murderer is,

569
00:27:38,830 --> 00:27:40,160
I'll give you an answer.

570
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:45,710
Let's eat.

571
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:06,230
Drink it while it's hot.

572
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:25,710
The God of Locusts descends
with boundless power.

573
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,430
The God of Locusts descends
with boundless power.

574
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:33,160
The God of Locusts descends
with boundless power.

575
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:36,830
The God of Locusts descends
with boundless power.

576
00:28:37,190 --> 00:28:39,000
Young Master, someone's looking for you.

577
00:28:40,950 --> 00:28:41,760
Deputy Commandant,

578
00:28:42,110 --> 00:28:43,640
Commandant asked you
to go back to Wei Suo right now.

579
00:28:44,430 --> 00:28:47,710
The God of Locusts descends
with boundless power.

580
00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:50,400
Captain Li.

581
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:51,040
Yes.

582
00:28:51,190 --> 00:28:52,110
Post notices,

583
00:28:52,110 --> 00:28:54,160
calling on all people in the county
to eliminate locusts.

584
00:28:54,430 --> 00:28:55,230
And,

585
00:28:55,230 --> 00:28:56,880
set out to all townships immediately

586
00:28:57,190 --> 00:28:59,470
and summon the township heads
and li heads to the yamen.

587
00:28:59,710 --> 00:29:00,520
Got it.

588
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,430
Send someone to guard Miss Jin's grave.

589
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,760
If anyone dares to dig it up again,

590
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
arrest them.

591
00:29:12,430 --> 00:29:13,230
Okay.

592
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:17,310
[Integrity, prudence and diligence]

593
00:29:17,310 --> 00:29:19,880
[Integrity, prudence and diligence]
Locusts are a major pest in the fields,

594
00:29:20,070 --> 00:29:21,400
not gods at all.

595
00:29:21,710 --> 00:29:24,230
A locust plague
has suddenly broken out in Linfen.

596
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:25,880
Our crops are in danger.

597
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,230
It's urgent to eliminate locusts.

598
00:29:28,230 --> 00:29:28,920
Eliminate locusts?

599
00:29:29,430 --> 00:29:30,760
Here are methods to eliminate locusts.

600
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,350
Set up nets to catch and kill them.

601
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:35,880
Or use fire to burn them.

602
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:37,430
We can't do that.

603
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:38,520
This...

604
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:40,350
The God of Locusts will be more angry.

605
00:29:42,230 --> 00:29:43,230
This magistrate

606
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:44,640
is obviously a bookworm.

607
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,710
He doesn't know
the power of the God of Locusts.

608
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,520
We can't listen to him.

609
00:29:48,590 --> 00:29:49,230
Yes.

610
00:29:49,230 --> 00:29:50,950
We can't listen to him.

611
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:54,000
Your Honor,

612
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:56,350
on behalf of
the people of surrounding villages

613
00:29:56,350 --> 00:29:57,680
and the people of Linfen,

614
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:59,830
I beg you to withdraw the notice

615
00:29:59,950 --> 00:30:01,070
and set up an altar

616
00:30:01,070 --> 00:30:03,000
to apologize to the God of Locusts

617
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:04,710
and bless the people of Linfen

618
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:06,280
to overcome this difficult time.

619
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:07,430
To overcome this difficult time.

620
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:11,280
Please get up.

621
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:12,680
[People's Court]
Everyone, please get up.

622
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:13,800
[People's Court]
Listen to me.

623
00:30:16,830 --> 00:30:18,000
Listen to me, everyone.

624
00:30:19,070 --> 00:30:19,680
The locust plague has broken out

625
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:21,430
is not because
the God of Locusts is angry.

626
00:30:21,950 --> 00:30:23,000
There was a severe drought last year,

627
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,470
followed by an unusually warm winter.

628
00:30:24,470 --> 00:30:26,560
It has led to a plague of locusts.

629
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:28,350
With a year of hard work,

630
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:31,350
your crops are going to be ruined by pests.

631
00:30:31,710 --> 00:30:32,830
Are you willing to accept that?

632
00:30:35,470 --> 00:30:37,190
If you want to save your crops

633
00:30:37,190 --> 00:30:38,430
and reduce some losses,

634
00:30:38,430 --> 00:30:39,640
listen to me.

635
00:30:40,310 --> 00:30:41,760
Let's eliminate locusts.

636
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:44,640
No, we can't do this.

637
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:45,880
Your Honor.

638
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:47,830
You're not a local here.

639
00:30:47,830 --> 00:30:50,400
You don't know the power
of the God of Locusts.

640
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:51,160
Yes, Your Honor,

641
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:53,040
you don't know the power
of the God of Locusts.

642
00:30:56,070 --> 00:30:58,280
Your Honor, you can't do this.

643
00:30:58,280 --> 00:30:58,760
Your Honor.

644
00:30:59,040 --> 00:30:59,520
Your Honor.

645
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:02,230
Your Honor.

646
00:31:02,950 --> 00:31:03,680
Shut up.

647
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,640
Whoever tries to mislead people

648
00:31:09,350 --> 00:31:10,400
and resist eliminating locusts,

649
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:12,400
will be relieved of their duties

650
00:31:12,710 --> 00:31:13,830
as township heads or li heads,

651
00:31:14,230 --> 00:31:16,280
and prosecuted according to
the laws of the Ming Dynasty.

652
00:31:17,190 --> 00:31:18,000
Now,

653
00:31:18,070 --> 00:31:19,680
you go back

654
00:31:19,710 --> 00:31:21,000
and lead your people
to eliminate locusts

655
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,470
according to the methods in the notice.

656
00:31:22,710 --> 00:31:23,760
If you neglect your duties,

657
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:25,400
I won't tolerate anymore.

658
00:31:27,830 --> 00:31:28,520
Your Honor.

659
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:29,760
What should we do?

660
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:31,350
Your Honor.

661
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:33,560
Post another notice.

662
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:34,560
Another one?

663
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:36,760
Those people are unwilling to do it.

664
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:37,830
Relying on them to eliminate locusts,

665
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:39,230
then all the crops in Linfen

666
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:40,430
will be destroyed.

667
00:31:41,470 --> 00:31:43,590
Do you mean to recruit
those who have lost their fields

668
00:31:43,590 --> 00:31:44,560
to eliminate locusts?

669
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:45,280
That's right.

670
00:31:47,430 --> 00:31:48,470
Just write that

671
00:31:49,070 --> 00:31:51,760
the yamen is recruiting volunteers

672
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:52,520
to eliminate locusts,

673
00:31:54,070 --> 00:31:55,310
with pay and meals provided.

674
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:56,520
Okay.

675
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:00,430
Is Luo Shu here?

676
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,280
It's me, Ruolan.

677
00:32:06,710 --> 00:32:08,430
Ruolan, come in.

678
00:32:09,350 --> 00:32:10,190
I see you're

679
00:32:10,190 --> 00:32:11,430
looking better these days.

680
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:12,070
This

681
00:32:12,070 --> 00:32:13,230
is a vat of Jinrui Liquor

682
00:32:13,230 --> 00:32:14,430
I saved from last year.

683
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:17,070
It's of a warm nature
and can nourish the stomach.

684
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:18,070
Try it.

685
00:32:19,350 --> 00:32:21,160
I've been disturbing you these days.

686
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:22,880
Don't say that.

687
00:32:22,950 --> 00:32:24,040
I'm so glad

688
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:25,470
that you live here.

689
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:29,160
But if you like this liquor,

690
00:32:29,190 --> 00:32:30,470
keep it and enjoy it slowly.

691
00:32:30,830 --> 00:32:32,040
We don't know

692
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:32,800
if we'll have grain

693
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:34,070
to brew more in the future.

694
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:35,400
No grain?

695
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:36,760
Don't you know?

696
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:38,880
It's been severely dry

697
00:32:39,070 --> 00:32:40,400
from last winter.

698
00:32:40,830 --> 00:32:42,520
Now there are locusts
all over the fields,

699
00:32:42,590 --> 00:32:44,110
eating up the crops.

700
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:45,920
Where can we get grain to brew liquor?

701
00:32:46,470 --> 00:32:47,280
Locusts?

702
00:32:48,190 --> 00:32:50,830
I heard that Magistrate Han
issued a notice

703
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:53,160
to recruit people to eliminate locusts.

704
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:54,950
But there are few respondents.

705
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:57,000
Everyone is afraid of
offending the God of Locusts.

706
00:32:57,430 --> 00:32:59,640
So Magistrate Han
had to post another notice

707
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:01,190
to recruit volunteers

708
00:33:01,190 --> 00:33:02,950
to form a pest eradication team.

709
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:07,000
I didn't know the locust plague
had become this severe.

710
00:33:07,190 --> 00:33:08,160
This locust plague

711
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:09,880
is a disaster

712
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,040
for the people of Linfen.

713
00:33:12,310 --> 00:33:14,110
I'll go to the yamen to ask about it.

714
00:33:14,230 --> 00:33:15,070
I'll take you there.

715
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:17,470
Where is she?

716
00:33:17,470 --> 00:33:18,160
Here she is.

717
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:19,710
Who are you? What are you doing?

718
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:20,760
We're looking for her.

719
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,000
She's also from Mingke House.

720
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:22,920
It was she who held the funeral

721
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:23,800
for that woman.

722
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:25,400
Take her away.

723
00:33:26,590 --> 00:33:27,350
Let go.

724
00:33:27,950 --> 00:33:28,830
Take her away.

725
00:33:29,430 --> 00:33:30,040
Luo Shu.

726
00:33:30,230 --> 00:33:31,830
The situation of the locust plague
is worsening.

727
00:33:32,070 --> 00:33:33,350
I have two requests.

728
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:34,680
First of all,

729
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:36,230
please dispatch reinforcements
from Pingyangwei.

730
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:37,560
Second,

731
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:39,800
famine will undoubtedly strike soon.

732
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:42,280
Please allocate funds and grain
for disaster relief

733
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:44,640
to save the people of Linfen
from their suffering.

734
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:45,710
Muzhi.

735
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:47,710
Dozens of people have come to volunteer.

736
00:33:49,230 --> 00:33:50,680
But that's far from enough.

737
00:33:51,110 --> 00:33:52,350
Since we have some volunteers right now,

738
00:33:52,350 --> 00:33:53,400
we should take action,

739
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:55,110
eliminating locusts
while continuing to recruit.

740
00:33:55,350 --> 00:33:56,160
Your Honor,

741
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:57,350
Your Honor.

742
00:33:57,350 --> 00:33:58,590
Luo Shu has been taken.

743
00:33:58,640 --> 00:33:59,430
What?

744
00:34:28,430 --> 00:34:29,320
Everyone.

745
00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:31,630
Someone has committed a sin

746
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:34,430
by holding a grand funeral to a performer,

747
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:36,430
which angered the heavens.

748
00:34:37,230 --> 00:34:38,910
God of Locusts sent troops

749
00:34:39,470 --> 00:34:41,520
to punish us.

750
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:43,870
This is the culprit.

751
00:34:44,190 --> 00:34:46,800
Today, we'll use her blood

752
00:34:47,150 --> 00:34:47,950
to sacrifice to the heavens.

753
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:49,360
To the God of Locusts.

754
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:52,000
To Heaven. To the God of Locusts.

755
00:34:52,150 --> 00:34:54,190
To Heaven. To the God of Locusts.

756
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:56,840
To Heaven. To the God of Locusts.

757
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:59,520
To Heaven. To the God of Locusts.

758
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:01,630
To Heaven. To the God of Locusts.

759
00:35:01,630 --> 00:35:02,470
Stop.

760
00:35:02,470 --> 00:35:05,630
To Heaven. To the God of Locusts.

761
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:08,800
Get out of the way.

762
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:10,080
Get out.

763
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:13,360
Captain Cai.

764
00:35:19,910 --> 00:35:20,800
Let's go.

765
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:22,520
You can't take her away.

766
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:23,080
Your Honor.

767
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:24,560
You can't take her away.

768
00:35:24,670 --> 00:35:25,430
Your Honor.

769
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:27,230
She's the sacrifice.

770
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:28,710
If you take her away,

771
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,760
you'll offend the heavens.

772
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,150
Stop spreading rumors.

773
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:33,910
Arrest him.

774
00:35:33,910 --> 00:35:34,560
Got it.

775
00:35:35,390 --> 00:35:36,120
Your Honor.

776
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:38,760
Sacrificing is the only way

777
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:40,560
to save our crops.

778
00:35:40,950 --> 00:35:41,910
If we don't sacrifice,

779
00:35:42,470 --> 00:35:43,840
the troops of the God of Locusts

780
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:45,710
will eat all crops

781
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:47,280
in the fields.

782
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:48,560
We will all

783
00:35:48,630 --> 00:35:50,670
starve to death.

784
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:56,800
We don't want to kill people,

785
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:59,280
but we have to

786
00:35:59,630 --> 00:36:00,670
keep our families alive.

787
00:36:00,670 --> 00:36:03,080
Yeah.

788
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:04,120
Today,

789
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:05,760
we must use this woman's blood

790
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,120
to sacrifice to the God of Locusts.

791
00:36:07,630 --> 00:36:09,390
Sacrifice!

792
00:36:09,390 --> 00:36:10,630
Do you really think

793
00:36:11,150 --> 00:36:12,470
a woman's blood

794
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:14,630
can get rid of

795
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:15,390
all those locusts?

796
00:36:15,670 --> 00:36:17,360
It's better than starving to death.

797
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:18,520
If you don't want to starve,

798
00:36:18,950 --> 00:36:20,840
join us to eliminate locusts.

799
00:36:21,150 --> 00:36:22,520
Eliminate locusts?

800
00:36:23,470 --> 00:36:25,950
Without crops, we'll lose our lives.

801
00:36:25,950 --> 00:36:27,710
If we have to die, we should die together.

802
00:36:27,710 --> 00:36:29,760
Right, die together.

803
00:36:30,630 --> 00:36:31,670
Take Luo Shu leave here.

804
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:33,950
Let's go, Luo Shu.

805
00:36:33,950 --> 00:36:36,840
Die together.

806
00:36:38,150 --> 00:36:39,120
Everyone,

807
00:36:40,150 --> 00:36:41,390
if my blood

808
00:36:41,710 --> 00:36:43,630
can prove Magistrate Han's words,

809
00:36:44,190 --> 00:36:45,670
can awaken everyone
to unite and exterminate locusts,

810
00:36:46,470 --> 00:36:47,710
I am willing to give it a try.

811
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:53,520
No!

812
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:59,390
This foolish act cannot be indulged.

813
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:01,710
You don't need to do that.

814
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:03,080
I...

815
00:37:04,150 --> 00:37:04,950
Get out of the way.

816
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:06,560
Get out of the way.

817
00:37:10,190 --> 00:37:10,870
Get out of the way.

818
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:18,120
Luo Shu, are you okay?

819
00:37:22,430 --> 00:37:23,520
Listen,

820
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:24,950
about this incident,

821
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:26,870
considering your ignorance,

822
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:27,670
I'll give you a chance

823
00:37:27,670 --> 00:37:29,280
to make it up.

824
00:37:29,670 --> 00:37:30,470
You can

825
00:37:30,470 --> 00:37:32,040
join our pest eradication team

826
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:33,320
to make it up for what you have done.

827
00:37:35,150 --> 00:37:36,080
Well,

828
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:37,150
you just put us in jail.

829
00:37:37,150 --> 00:37:38,710
We can't offend the God of Locusts.

830
00:37:38,710 --> 00:37:39,430
Yeah.

831
00:37:39,430 --> 00:37:40,710
We can't offend the God of Locusts.

832
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,000
Arrest us if you want.

833
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,390
At least we have meals in jail.

834
00:37:43,390 --> 00:37:45,120
It's better than starving to death.

835
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:45,560
Yeah.

836
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:47,760
They just use the God of Locusts
as an excuse.

837
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:49,910
They're just scared of not having grain.

838
00:37:50,430 --> 00:37:51,520
We'll give them grain.

839
00:37:52,630 --> 00:37:53,760
Let's exchange locusts for grain.

840
00:37:54,870 --> 00:37:56,320
But, we don't have...

841
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:58,520
Han, you just arrange for them

842
00:37:58,760 --> 00:37:59,800
to eliminate locusts.

843
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:01,870
They can take locust carcasses

844
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:03,470
to Pingyangwei for grain.

845
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:06,280
You're gonna use military grain?

846
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,280
No.

847
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:09,280
Using military grain without permission

848
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:10,840
is a capital offence.

849
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:11,470
Han,

850
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:13,190
look at them right now.

851
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:15,910
Nothing is important
than eliminating locusts.

852
00:38:18,430 --> 00:38:19,360
Thanks for reminding me,

853
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:22,600
but I think

854
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:24,710
I can get grain.

855
00:38:28,630 --> 00:38:29,910
Listen up,

856
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:31,470
from today on,

857
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:34,120
we'll exchange locusts for grain
in Linfen.

858
00:38:34,630 --> 00:38:36,430
Exchange locusts for grain?
Never heard of it.

859
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:38,120
The more locusts you kill,

860
00:38:38,430 --> 00:38:40,280
the more food you'll get.

861
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:41,630
The more food you have,

862
00:38:41,630 --> 00:38:43,390
the less likely your family will starve.

863
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:45,280
If anyone still takes these locusts

864
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:47,040
as the God of Locusts,

865
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:48,710
just go ahead.

866
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:50,190
I'd like to see

867
00:38:50,230 --> 00:38:51,600
if the God of Locusts

868
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:53,150
can really bring you food.

869
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,360
I keep my word.

870
00:38:55,630 --> 00:38:57,190
One dou of locust carcasses

871
00:38:57,230 --> 00:38:58,870
can exchange for one sheng of grain.

872
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:03,390
Your Honor,

873
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:05,120
you're not cheating us, are you?

874
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:06,630
Yeah, are you cheating us?

875
00:39:06,630 --> 00:39:07,870
Is that true?

876
00:39:08,150 --> 00:39:09,520
Where do we exchange?

877
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:11,630
I'll find a place to post the notice

878
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,080
and let everyone in the county know.

879
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,470
We can survive now.

880
00:39:16,470 --> 00:39:18,080
What if we catch

881
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:19,390
one dan of locusts?

882
00:39:19,470 --> 00:39:21,950
Then you'll get one dou of grain.

883
00:39:22,630 --> 00:39:23,560
One dou?

884
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:31,190
Thank you, Your Honor.

885
00:39:31,710 --> 00:39:33,120
I'll prepare the grain

886
00:39:33,230 --> 00:39:34,040
and wait for you all.

887
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:34,670
Great.

888
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:44,120
It seems that this locust plague

889
00:39:44,910 --> 00:39:46,950
has become an opportunity.

890
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:48,560
Exactly.

891
00:39:49,870 --> 00:39:51,670
Mr. Liu, you've planning for years.

892
00:39:51,910 --> 00:39:52,670
What you need

893
00:39:52,670 --> 00:39:54,840
is just such a pretext, isn't it?

894
00:39:57,910 --> 00:39:59,710
We still need to plan carefully.

895
00:40:01,430 --> 00:40:03,950
By the way, Qin Yi

896
00:40:03,950 --> 00:40:05,630
has been talking to me

897
00:40:05,710 --> 00:40:07,360
many times.

898
00:40:07,430 --> 00:40:09,080
He wants to see you.

899
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:12,120
Let him wait a little longer.

900
00:40:13,950 --> 00:40:15,000
Find out

901
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:16,040
the relationship

902
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:17,520
between him and the Qi family.

903
00:40:17,670 --> 00:40:19,000
I understand.

904
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:21,470
Here

905
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:24,150
I have a letter

906
00:40:24,150 --> 00:40:25,120
from the magistrate of Linfen.

907
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:27,630
He's asking for money and food.

908
00:40:28,870 --> 00:40:30,360
You're in charge of these things.

909
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:32,120
Take a careful look.

910
00:40:34,430 --> 00:40:35,800
The disaster in Linfen

911
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:37,320
is truly serious.

912
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:39,950
Magistrate Han is really desperate.

913
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:41,190
But I heard

914
00:40:41,190 --> 00:40:43,430
he has achieved
political achievements in Linfen

915
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:46,120
because of

916
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:47,670
your excellent guidance.

917
00:40:49,630 --> 00:40:51,040
I'll get something to eat for Father.

918
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:55,560
Father.

919
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:58,150
Mr. Zhao is also here.

920
00:40:59,000 --> 00:40:59,800
Perfect timing.

921
00:41:00,230 --> 00:41:01,800
Please try the snacks I made for Father.

922
00:41:03,710 --> 00:41:05,910
Wan, you're so skilled.

923
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:08,710
I'm fortunate to be able to enjoy them.

924
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:11,120
You've basically

925
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:12,670
watched Wan grow up.

926
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:13,670
Don't say that.

927
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:14,840
Alright.

928
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:20,040
I've heard that
there has been a locust plague.

929
00:41:20,230 --> 00:41:21,710
Many people's grain

930
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:23,150
have been destroyed.

931
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:26,080
Father, Mr. Zhao,

932
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:28,390
you've been working so hard.

933
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:30,710
The lives and property

934
00:41:30,710 --> 00:41:31,760
of tens of thousands of people in Shanxi

935
00:41:32,470 --> 00:41:34,360
rest on your shoulders.

936
00:41:35,150 --> 00:41:37,520
Wan is truly well-read.

937
00:41:38,230 --> 00:41:40,390
You can share your father's concerns.

938
00:41:41,230 --> 00:41:42,320
Zhao and I

939
00:41:42,630 --> 00:41:44,120
are talking about this.

940
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:46,910
I only wish I were a man,

941
00:41:46,950 --> 00:41:48,280
so I could share your burdens

942
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:49,430
and contribute to the imperial court.

943
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:52,910
You're a girl.

944
00:41:52,910 --> 00:41:54,760
Being well-read, well-mannered,

945
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:55,840
and able to raise children

946
00:41:56,190 --> 00:41:57,360
is enough.

947
00:41:59,230 --> 00:42:00,630
You are right.

948
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:03,600
I heard that locusts

949
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:05,710
entered Shanxi from the southwest,

950
00:42:06,710 --> 00:42:08,470
so the disaster under Muzhi's governance

951
00:42:08,670 --> 00:42:09,800
must be severe.

952
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:14,430
It caused widespread disaster.

953
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:17,080
We will consider relief efforts.

954
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:19,520
Mr. Zhao, you're the
administrative commissioner.

955
00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:20,430
You won't ignore it,

956
00:42:20,430 --> 00:42:21,600
will you?

957
00:42:22,950 --> 00:42:24,190
For the people of Linfen,

958
00:42:24,190 --> 00:42:25,600
and on behalf of Muzhi,

959
00:42:26,190 --> 00:42:27,520
I'm here to thank you in advance.

960
00:42:27,630 --> 00:42:28,430
Don't do this.

961
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:31,040
I'll try my best.

962
00:42:33,150 --> 00:42:33,950
Wan,

963
00:42:34,910 --> 00:42:36,230
don't put Zhao in that position.

964
00:42:38,390 --> 00:42:39,670
We have important things to discuss.

965
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:42,320
I'll leave now, Father.

966
00:42:54,230 --> 00:42:54,630
She...

967
00:42:56,870 --> 00:42:57,520
She's been spoiled.
