[Episode 35]

4
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:50,720
Take a nap.

5
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:52,950
We have a lot to do later.

6
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:56,870
Thank you, Luo Shu.

7
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,080
Without you,

8
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:01,400
I don't know

9
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,590
if I could have made it this far.

10
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,760
It's your heart that supports you.

11
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:07,480
Even though

12
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:09,160
it doesn't help
clear the name of your family,

13
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:10,670
you still choose to

14
00:02:10,670 --> 00:02:11,830
buy the grain

15
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:13,030
and return it to the people.

16
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:15,960
The righteousness within you

17
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,910
also supports me.

18
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,000
I don't know

19
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:27,520
how much longer I can hold on.

20
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,080
As long as you still breathe,

21
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,720
you should hold on till the end.

22
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:36,630
I'll stay with you.

23
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:44,750
With you by my side,

24
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:47,030
I'll die without regrets.

25
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:48,320
Say "Pei".

26
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,800
Never think about dying.

27
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:52,270
You should believe
that justice will prevail.

28
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:54,000
Will it work?

29
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,880
Of course. Come on.

30
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:57,550
Pei.

31
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,830
Master.

32
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:06,800
Master, I'm sorry.

33
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,110
I'm sorry.

34
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:09,270
I was deceived.

35
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:10,360
I dare not do it again, Master.

36
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,670
Please spare my life.

37
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:13,190
Where did you sell the grain?

38
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:14,630
Taoyuan Ferry.

39
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:15,830
It's close to here, Master.

40
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:16,470
I can take you there.

41
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:17,670
We'll get it back.

42
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:18,750
We'll get it back.

43
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:20,110
Please spare me, Master.

44
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:21,880
Please spare me, Master.

45
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:34,440
There are ships.

46
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,080
Regional Military Commissioner orders

47
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:45,670
to arrest for Qi Menglin,

48
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:48,440
former Deputy Commandant of Pingyangwei,
throughout the province.

49
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:51,320
I hope they've gone far away.

50
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,110
Your Honor.

51
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:55,630
Your Honor, Mr. Chen.

52
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:56,750
What's going on?

53
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:58,390
Luo Shu and Mr. Qi are back.

54
00:03:59,000 --> 00:03:59,750
Back?

55
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:00,440
Yes.

56
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:01,470
Where are they?

57
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:02,240
At the dock.

58
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,270
They brought back two ships of grain

59
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:04,320
and said they wanted to distribute.

60
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:05,270
Distribute grain?

61
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:10,440
What's going on?

62
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:11,670
Look at the grain in the back.

63
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:12,910
Are they really gonna distribute grain?

64
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:14,440
They're not cheating us again, are they?

65
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:15,360
Yeah.

66
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,950
How dare you show up again.

67
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:17,760
That's right.

68
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:19,830
Listen to me.

69
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,160
It's really grain.

70
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,160
For real?

71
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:24,390
Is it real?

72
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:25,510
You cheated us last time.

73
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:26,000
How dare you come again.

74
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,230
Are you gonna cheat us again?

75
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:29,880
Who's gonna believe it.

76
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:31,600
Look.

77
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:33,920
It's real.

78
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,350
It's different.

79
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:36,510
It's different than the last time.

80
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:38,040
It's grain.

81
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,320
It's different.

82
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:41,510
He's coming.

83
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:42,600
Everyone.

84
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:43,880
This is the grain

85
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,040
I promised to distribute last time.

86
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:46,040
I didn't expect

87
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,880
it was switched on the way.

88
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,230
But thankfully,

89
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:50,440
we found it again.

90
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:52,000
This time,

91
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:52,790
we'll distribute to you.

92
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:54,600
Who exactly

93
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,880
switched the grain?

94
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:56,550
Yeah.

95
00:04:56,550 --> 00:04:58,000
Tell us.

96
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,160
We haven't found the evidence.

97
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:00,510
The only thing we can do now

98
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:02,200
is to distribute the grain to you.

99
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:04,550
If you don't say,

100
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:05,950
we won't take the grain.

101
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:07,720
The origin is unknown.

102
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,270
It won't be poisonous, will it?

103
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:09,720
Yeah.

104
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,040
Yeah.

105
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:11,880
Tell us.

106
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,320
Where did you get the grain?

107
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:14,640
Who switched it?

108
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:16,270
And how did you find it?

109
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:18,480
Yes, say it.

110
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,040
It's Liu Yiqing,
Shanxi provincial governor.

111
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:21,950
Who is it? Liu Yiqing?

112
00:05:22,670 --> 00:05:23,600
I'm Luo Shu,

113
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:25,920
the former constable of the yamen.

114
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:28,160
I recognize her.

115
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:29,790
She's the only female constable
in the yamen.

116
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:31,200
She's solved many cases.

117
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,110
So tell us,

118
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:33,390
what happened exactly?

119
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:35,510
Mr. Liu has been Governor Qi's

120
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:36,920
political opponent for years.

121
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,230
Mr. Liu has been waiting for a chance
to destroy the Qi family.

122
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:40,920
This famine

123
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:42,510
became his opportunity.

124
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:45,110
Magistrate Han went to Taiyuan

125
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,720
to beg for relief grain repeatedly,

126
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,230
but he kept pulling off

127
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:49,670
and refused to allocate the grain.

128
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,600
After learning about this,

129
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:53,390
Mr. Qi took two ships

130
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:54,390
of military grain

131
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:55,790
from his father's granary,

132
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:56,760
and sent them to Linfen.

133
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:58,270
However,

134
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,880
Mr. Liu's accomplice

135
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:01,830
Qin Yi, the richest man in Shanxi,

136
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:03,480
manipulated

137
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,230
and switched the grain with rice husks,

138
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:07,070
which were what you saw before.

139
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:10,040
So evil.

140
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,000
So how did you

141
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,640
find the grain?

142
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:15,510
Do you know Taoyuan Ferry?

143
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:17,670
I know that place.

144
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:19,600
It's a small dock.

145
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:21,480
Next to Luosha Port.

146
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:22,600
Are you talking about

147
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,160
the Taoyuan Ferry at Luosha Port?

148
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:24,830
Yes.

149
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:26,440
That's where

150
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:27,600
we found the military grain

151
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,230
being sold at a high price

152
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:30,270
by a heartless merchant.

153
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:33,440
Look.

154
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:35,760
[Military Grain]
This is what we found

155
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,510
[Military Grain]
in the granary at Taoyuan Ferry.

156
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,270
I know it.

157
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:40,070
It's the same as the bags

158
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:41,270
that were filled with
rice husks last time.

159
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:42,320
[Military Grain]
This is it.

160
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:43,390
I recognize it.

161
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:44,880
Whether you believe us or not,

162
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:46,790
the grain in these two ships

163
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,110
is what I promised

164
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:49,040
to distribute before.

165
00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:50,600
Now we've found it.

166
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:52,230
Please take your grain and go home.

167
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:54,550
I believe him.

168
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,040
It's him.

169
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,920
He helped us to eliminate locusts.

170
00:06:58,110 --> 00:07:00,000
I trust him because of that.

171
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:00,790
That's true.

172
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:01,720
He led the troops

173
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:02,920
to help us eliminate locusts.

174
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,200
He's the
Deputy Commandant of Pingyangwei.

175
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:06,550
Yeah, the Exchange Locusts for Grain

176
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:07,440
was put forward by

177
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,390
Commandant Qi and Magistrate Han.

178
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,200
This method

179
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,510
helped us get rid of locusts

180
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,550
and earn food.

181
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:15,040
I recognize him now.

182
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,670
He sent troops of Pingyangwei

183
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:17,510
to help us.

184
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:18,350
If it weren't for him,

185
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:19,110
our grain

186
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:20,320
would have been destroyed by locusts.

187
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,320
That's him.

188
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,640
We believe you.

189
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,200
We believe you.

190
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:25,790
We believe you.

191
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,670
We believe you.

192
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:28,510
Thank you.

193
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:31,200
We believe you.

194
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:34,390
Thank you.

195
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:36,830
Captain Cai,

196
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,160
aren't we here to arrest them?

197
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,200
Why haven't we made a move?

198
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:40,350
No rush.

199
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:41,830
Magistrate Han said

200
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:43,110
we couldn't disturb people.

201
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,040
Please line up.

202
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,110
Line up.

203
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:53,510
Everyone will get some.

204
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:07,670
Master, someone's distributing grain
on the shore.

205
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:14,640
Dock the ship.

206
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:15,760
Got it.

207
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:17,640
Hurry up. Dock the ship.

208
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,040
Line up, everyone.

209
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:25,790
The Qi family is distributing grain.

210
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:26,760
Thank you.

211
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:32,150
Please line up. You'll all get some.

212
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:33,670
Don't worry.

213
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:35,470
Go.

214
00:08:35,470 --> 00:08:36,110
Got it.

215
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:36,840
Follow me.

216
00:08:37,790 --> 00:08:38,350
Stop.

217
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:41,670
Miss Luo, come with me.

218
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:43,960
Hurry up.

219
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:44,960
Go, go.

220
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,110
Aren't we afraid of
disturbing people now?

221
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:49,590
Stop.

222
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:53,080
Move.

223
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:55,910
Where are they?

224
00:08:56,350 --> 00:08:57,150
Where are they?

225
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:00,910
That way, chase them.

226
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:02,110
Go.

227
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:06,960
It seems that

228
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:07,790
Qin Yi

229
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:08,960
won't give up easily.

230
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:10,710
Regional Military Commissioner
has issued

231
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:12,030
arrest warrants to all prefectures.

232
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:13,110
Now if Mr. Qi

233
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:14,400
steps out of the yamen,

234
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:15,760
he will be in danger.

235
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:22,470
You just hide in the yamen.

236
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:24,840
As long as I'm the magistrate of Linfen,

237
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:26,230
I'll ensure your safety.

238
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:28,910
We can't hide forever.

239
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:30,350
We still have to find evidence.

240
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:32,440
Mr. Cai,

241
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,110
can you find someone

242
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:35,000
to help me send a letter?

243
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:35,710
Okay.

244
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:53,590
Mr. Cai,

245
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,230
please send someone
to Taiyuan right away

246
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:56,150
to this place

247
00:09:56,710 --> 00:09:57,710
and give this letter to Lian Shu.

248
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:58,760
Okay.

249
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:08,350
What are you doing?

250
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:10,640
Han, you've helped me a lot.

251
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:13,320
I don't know how to repay you.

252
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:15,640
Don't say that.

253
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:17,840
You and Luo Shu

254
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,230
have done so much for the yamen

255
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:20,150
and the people of Linfen.

256
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:21,840
Besides, this time

257
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,110
you've ended up in this situation

258
00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:24,350
because of the people of Linfen.

259
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:25,640
Your Honor.

260
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:27,320
Your Honor, we're in trouble.

261
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,710
A group of people

262
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:30,670
have surrounded the gate,

263
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:31,280
and demanded that

264
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,320
we hand over Mr. Qi

265
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,230
and Miss Luo.

266
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:35,320
It's Qin Yi.

267
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:39,590
Here comes the magistrate.

268
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:53,440
Look at you, Mr. Qin,

269
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:55,590
are you gonna besiege the yamen?

270
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:58,030
Magistrate Han, you're overthinking it.

271
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,200
I'm here on behalf of Mr. Liu

272
00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:01,960
to arrest imperial fugitive Qi Menglin,

273
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:04,000
the remnant of the Qi family.

274
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:07,960
May I kindly request your cooperation?

275
00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:09,400
How do you know he's here?

276
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:11,470
I saw him with my own eyes.

277
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:15,320
The carriage is parked behind the yamen.

278
00:11:15,710 --> 00:11:16,910
He is here.

279
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:19,840
Let me ask you.

280
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,280
What is your official title?

281
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:23,400
What rank are you?

282
00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:24,710
Do you have the official document

283
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:25,880
issued by the governor yamen?

284
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:28,350
I don't know about that.

285
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,470
All I have is

286
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:31,960
Mr. Liu's word of command.

287
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:34,230
If you don't believe it,

288
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:35,910
just hand over him

289
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,350
and come with me to Taiyuan

290
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:39,880
to verify with Mr. Liu in person.

291
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:43,710
Ridiculous.

292
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:45,880
You're neither an official

293
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:46,880
nor do you have the document.

294
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:47,910
You just come to Linfen Yamen

295
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:49,910
to arrest someone
with a word of command.

296
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:52,640
Where is the justice?

297
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,470
So,

298
00:11:56,670 --> 00:11:57,640
you're not handing him over.

299
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:58,760
Of course not.

300
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,110
If you're not happy about it,

301
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,350
just storm into and arrest him yourself.

302
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:09,350
Confronting the authorities
is akin to treason.

303
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:11,080
It's a capital crime.

304
00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:12,470
I want to see

305
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:13,590
who dares to protect you.

306
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:15,440
Move aside.

307
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:19,030
Please.

308
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:28,880
Alright.

309
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:33,590
You all stay here and keep watch.

310
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:34,280
Got it.

311
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,590
I want to see

312
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,520
if Qi Menglin can hide

313
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,440
in this small yamen temporarily,

314
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,840
or if he can hide here forever.

315
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:43,550
Mr. Qin, suit yourself.

316
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,150
Close the gate.

317
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:45,790
Let's go.

318
00:12:57,670 --> 00:12:59,670
Keep a close eye on everything.

319
00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:00,520
Got it.

320
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:08,440
Mr. Liu,

321
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:09,640
Qi Menglin

322
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:10,840
is hiding in the Linfen Yamen.

323
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:13,320
Qin Yi can't do anything about it.

324
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:18,840
It's truly tough.

325
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:24,000
How about eliminating them all?

326
00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:25,400
What?

327
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:30,350
You're not kidding, right?

328
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:32,110
I'm slow-witted.

329
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:34,030
Please enlighten me.

330
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,400
Qin Yi

331
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:41,400
is too ruthless.

332
00:13:43,470 --> 00:13:45,280
As for the man in the yamen,

333
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:47,910
as long as he's alive,

334
00:13:48,590 --> 00:13:50,670
my daughter won't give him up.

335
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,110
In the end,

336
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:54,550
not only will my beloved daughter

337
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:55,640
become his woman,

338
00:13:56,590 --> 00:13:58,840
but I will also be subject to his control.

339
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:03,470
That's a trouble.

340
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,200
Really tough.

341
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:08,760
You mean to

342
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:10,840
let Qin Yi and Han Muzhi

343
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,640
fight to the death?

344
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,470
Whoever lives or dies,

345
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:18,230
it'll be convenient for us to

346
00:14:18,710 --> 00:14:19,910
eliminate both threats.

347
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:25,760
Mr. Zhao.

348
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,470
That's a good idea.

349
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:34,550
Mr. Liu, I understand.

350
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,820
[Li's Bank]

351
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:47,670
Eliminate Han?

352
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:50,790
What does that mean?

353
00:14:52,590 --> 00:14:54,670
I suppose it means to ask you

354
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,590
to kill Han Muzhi.

355
00:14:57,470 --> 00:14:59,200
But I'm catching Qi Menglin right now.

356
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,350
I have no time.

357
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,590
What should I do?

358
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:04,840
This is Mr. Liu's order

359
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,150
for you.

360
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:07,710
Why are you asking me, Mr. Qin?

361
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:08,840
Peng Cheng,

362
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:11,400
You think

363
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,000
just because Mr. Liu has your back,

364
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:15,000
you can replace me, don't you?

365
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,280
If one day

366
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:18,790
you're in my position,

367
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:20,440
Mr. Liu will let

368
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:22,880
another one replace you.

369
00:15:24,030 --> 00:15:25,400
You know it, right?

370
00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:29,670
How about I give you some advice.

371
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:31,960
It'll benefit both of us.

372
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:33,590
You should know that

373
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,440
Mr. Liu asked me to kill Han Muzhi

374
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:38,520
just to kill two birds with one stone.

375
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:39,790
He wants to use my hand

376
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:41,670
to kill his disobedient son-in-law

377
00:15:42,030 --> 00:15:43,320
and pin the murder

378
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:44,520
on me.

379
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:45,880
As for

380
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:47,230
why he wants to do this,

381
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:50,030
I'm sure you know that, too.

382
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:51,840
After all,

383
00:15:52,590 --> 00:15:54,350
I defected from the Qi family.

384
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:57,150
He has never trusted me.

385
00:15:58,520 --> 00:15:59,880
But since I'm still useful,

386
00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:02,710
so he's using me for now.

387
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,110
You really

388
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:08,550

389
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:10,280
So what are you gonna do?

390
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,960
I want you to do it.

391
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,590
You really are calculating.

392
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:23,200
You want me to kill Magistrate Han,

393
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,910
making me your scapegoat.

394
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:25,960
Wrong.

395
00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:29,400
Killing Han Muzhi doesn't
mean your death.

396
00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:30,960
To be honest,

397
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,960
in Shanxi,

398
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:34,880
whoever Mr. Liu wants dead,

399
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:35,640
dies.

400
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:37,590
Whoever he wants to live, lives.

401
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,320
If I kill Han Muzhi,

402
00:16:40,350 --> 00:16:41,200
I'll definitely die.

403
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,760
But if you do it,

404
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:45,910
you won't die,

405
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:48,840
you'll even be rewarded.

406
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,880
Even if I kill Han Muzhi,

407
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:03,200
and Mr. Liu can protect me,

408
00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:05,040
but why would I

409
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:07,110
take the hit for you?

410
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:11,000
When the birds are gone,
the bow is stored.

411
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:13,400
Don't you understand

412
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,470
the meaning of that?

413
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:19,560
If I die,

414
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:22,230
you'll be the next.

415
00:17:23,190 --> 00:17:24,160
If I don't die,

416
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,280
you still have your value,

417
00:17:26,950 --> 00:17:28,400
keeping an eye on me for Mr. Liu

418
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:29,590
and balancing me.

419
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:33,110
In such a big place like Shanxi,

420
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:35,230
the more power Mr. Liu has,

421
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:36,590
the more business opportunities
there are.

422
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:39,110
I can't take them all.

423
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:41,280
Instead of turning our swords
against each other,

424
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,760
why don't we

425
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:44,830
appear to balance each other,

426
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:48,430
but secretly work together?

427
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:49,920
By then,

428
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:51,400
if Mr. Liu wants to

429
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:52,710
kill either of us,

430
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:55,000
he'll have to think twice.

431
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:02,950
But if I fail...

00:26:36,830 --> 00:26:37,640
Medicine?

578
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:40,040
No, I have to go find her.

579
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,310
Are you sure you can?

580
00:26:48,350 --> 00:26:48,880
Go.

581
00:26:55,470 --> 00:26:56,280
Behave.

582
00:26:58,230 --> 00:26:59,110
Don't move.

583
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:01,470
Master, I got one.

584
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:23,560
Master.

585
00:27:23,590 --> 00:27:24,760
Great job.

586
00:27:25,430 --> 00:27:26,310
You may leave now.

587
00:27:27,070 --> 00:27:28,000
Yes, Master.

588
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:32,800
Sorry about that.

589
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:34,560
Coming back to this place again,

590
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:37,070
are you still familiar
with everything here?

591
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:40,000
What happened
to the people in Mingke House?

592
00:27:40,830 --> 00:27:41,560
You don't think

593
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:42,800
I killed them, do you?

594
00:27:43,470 --> 00:27:45,040
How can I do that?

595
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:47,400
They are so obedient.

596
00:27:47,950 --> 00:27:49,160
The only one who isn't obedient

597
00:27:50,590 --> 00:27:51,470
is you.

598
00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:55,310
How could you be so disobedient?

599
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,190
Yulan.

600
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:14,060
[Closed]

601
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:29,830
Buddy.

602
00:28:30,230 --> 00:28:31,040
Buddy.

603
00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:34,400
Have you seen a young girl

604
00:28:34,470 --> 00:28:35,590
come here to get medicine?

605
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:40,760
Are you Mr. Qi who distributed grain?

606
00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:44,000
Have you seen her?

607
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:46,400
Where did she go?

608
00:28:46,710 --> 00:28:47,950
She was caught

609
00:28:47,950 --> 00:28:48,800
by Lai Er and his men.

610
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:49,680
Lai Er

611
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:51,160
is the head of the hooligans here.

612
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:52,040
She was caught?

613
00:28:52,590 --> 00:28:53,680
Which direction did they go?

614
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:55,160
Over there.

615
00:28:57,070 --> 00:28:57,800
Thanks.

616
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:01,760
Don't be so stubborn.

617
00:29:03,430 --> 00:29:04,880
The Qi family is doomed.

618
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:06,470
Now tell me

619
00:29:06,470 --> 00:29:08,640
where Qi Menglin is.

620
00:29:08,710 --> 00:29:10,800
I will forgive you.

621
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,560
The mistress of the Qin family

622
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:14,000
will still be you.

623
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:16,470
Do you think

624
00:29:16,470 --> 00:29:18,110
the Qin family can survive?

625
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:20,400
People in Linfen

626
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:21,230
all know

627
00:29:21,590 --> 00:29:23,000
that you colluded with Mr. Liu

628
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,560
to switch the grain.

629
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:26,640
Why are you still so stubborn?

630
00:29:28,310 --> 00:29:29,880
Who cares about those people?

631
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:32,110
Who cares about what they think and say?

632
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:35,950
Are you trying to
incite public resentment

633
00:29:36,070 --> 00:29:37,710
to help clear the name of the Qi family?

634
00:29:40,430 --> 00:29:42,430
That's too far-fetched.

635
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:45,400
If public opinion is useless,

636
00:29:46,350 --> 00:29:47,110
why did Mr. Liu

637
00:29:47,110 --> 00:29:49,350
use the famine to set the trap?

638
00:29:55,310 --> 00:29:56,640
What do you think you are

639
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:57,710
in Mr. Liu's eyes?

640
00:29:58,110 --> 00:29:59,280
An ally?

641
00:29:59,350 --> 00:30:00,280
I'm telling you.

642
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:02,400
You're not even a pawn.

643
00:30:03,430 --> 00:30:05,310
You've worked with the Qi family
these years,

644
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:06,880
handling countless

645
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,190
dirty deeds for them.

646
00:30:08,350 --> 00:30:10,040
In the name of Governor Qi,

647
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:11,590
you've committed numerous crimes.

648
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:12,710
You're

649
00:30:12,710 --> 00:30:14,310
the greatest evidence
of the Qi family's crimes.

650
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,560
If Mr. Liu wants to
destroy the Qi family completely,

651
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,000
he will eventually

652
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,350
kill you.

653
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:20,310
Shut up.

654
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:21,000
What do you take me for?

655
00:31:22,590 --> 00:31:23,350
I'll get

656
00:31:23,350 --> 00:31:24,470
whatever I want,

657
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:25,880
including you.

658
00:31:26,710 --> 00:31:28,680
Selling your deflowering night

659
00:31:29,350 --> 00:31:30,560
was just an excuse

660
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:33,070
to scare you.

661
00:31:33,710 --> 00:31:35,110
How could I really do that?

662
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:37,640
I care about you so much.

663
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:38,710
How can I let you

664
00:31:38,710 --> 00:31:40,400
fall into someone else's hands?

665
00:31:40,470 --> 00:31:41,830
You can only belong to me.

666
00:31:42,110 --> 00:31:43,190
You can only be mine.

667
00:32:02,070 --> 00:32:02,760
You really

668
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:04,560
don't know how to cherish a man.

669
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:11,280
Trying to run away?

670
00:32:14,070 --> 00:32:15,640
Where do you think you can go?

671
00:32:17,590 --> 00:32:18,800
If you run away,

672
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:21,430
Qi Menglin won't come.

673
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:23,590
You miscalculated.

674
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:24,950
He won't come.

675
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:26,760
If he really doesn't come,

676
00:32:32,430 --> 00:32:33,350
all of this

677
00:32:33,350 --> 00:32:34,800
will be in vain.

678
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,160
Today, I'll make a bet with you.

679
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:45,040
Let's see who will win.

680
00:32:45,710 --> 00:32:46,680
Let her go.

681
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:53,040
We were just talking about you.

682
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:54,430
Here you are.

683
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:57,880
Don't come here.

684
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:59,000
Go.

685
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:00,920
Mr. Menglin,

686
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:02,400
you really haven't let me down.

687
00:33:06,470 --> 00:33:07,280
Qin Yi,

688
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:11,110
how about we make a deal?

689
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:12,160
Deal?

690
00:33:13,430 --> 00:33:14,590
Today,

691
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:17,230
what do you have to trade with me?

692
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:21,590
My life.

693
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:30,110
Your life?

694
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:33,230
He said he'll trade his life.

695
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:37,000
What do you want me to do?

696
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:38,830
Take my life,

697
00:33:39,470 --> 00:33:40,280
and let her go.

698
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:41,590
Qi Menglin.

699
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:44,950
I thought that

700
00:33:44,950 --> 00:33:46,920
being with you till the end of our lives
would be perfection.

701
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:50,070
But now,

702
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:54,430
I just want you to live well.

703
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:57,160
So touching.

704
00:34:03,830 --> 00:34:04,880
Qin Yi.

705
00:34:05,310 --> 00:34:06,590
Even if you kill him,

706
00:34:06,710 --> 00:34:07,830
Mr. Liu still won't

707
00:34:07,830 --> 00:34:08,840
spare you.

708
00:34:09,950 --> 00:34:10,760
Really?

709
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:12,520
Yulan,

710
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:14,710
you are so heartless.

711
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:17,600
Qin Yi, let her go.

712
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:20,120
Why should I let her go?

713
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:22,120
Who do you think you are

714
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:23,280
to negotiate with me?

715
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,390
Negotiate what?

716
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:26,630
Your life is mine now.

717
00:34:27,950 --> 00:34:29,190
Yulan is also mine.

718
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:30,360
Did I say

719
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:31,760
that I want to make a deal with you?

720
00:34:34,430 --> 00:34:35,840
But I can show you

721
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:39,910
how obedient Yulan is

722
00:34:39,910 --> 00:34:41,190
in my arms.

723
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:45,560
Let her go!

724
00:34:51,430 --> 00:34:53,230
Do you regret it now,

725
00:34:53,230 --> 00:34:54,190
huh?

726
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:55,840
This fool

727
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:57,630
is too naive to think that his death

728
00:34:57,630 --> 00:34:58,760
can save your life.

729
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:00,280
But this fool,

730
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:01,520
he is indeed our future.

731
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:02,600
Only when he dies,

732
00:35:02,870 --> 00:35:04,040
can we survive.

733
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,840
Master.

734
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:09,190
Master, we're in trouble.

735
00:35:09,230 --> 00:35:09,870
Magistrate Han

736
00:35:09,870 --> 00:35:11,280
is coming here

737
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,470
with a large group of constables.

738
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:15,430
Seal the door immediately.

739
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:16,600
Hurry up, you

740
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:17,520
go to seal the door.

741
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:18,190
Got it.

742
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:20,190
Seal the door.

743
00:35:20,870 --> 00:35:21,430
Hurry up.

744
00:35:22,230 --> 00:35:23,800
Guys, the officials are coming,

745
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:24,670
let's go.

746
00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:26,470
Surround Mingke House.

747
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:28,520
Arrest anyone who tries to stop.

748
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:33,080
Qin Yi.

749
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:34,710
You took advantage of the famine,

750
00:35:34,710 --> 00:35:36,560
controlling the grain prices,
monopolizing the grain sources,

751
00:35:36,670 --> 00:35:38,710
and selling military grain.
Your crimes are unforgivable.

752
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:40,280
Three Provincial Commissions

753
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:41,760
have issued arrest warrants for you.

754
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:46,390
Qin Yi, surrender now!

755
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:48,760
I told you,

756
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:51,280
Mr. Liu won't spare you.

757
00:35:53,230 --> 00:35:55,560
That's impossible. I'm still useful.

758
00:35:55,950 --> 00:35:57,390
They won't kill me so soon.

759
00:35:57,910 --> 00:35:58,840
Just Han Muzhi

760
00:35:58,840 --> 00:35:59,950
and a few constables want to arrest me?

761
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,230
No way.

762
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:03,710
Han Muzhi,

763
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:06,230
you're openly shielding
the remnant of the Qi family.

764
00:36:06,390 --> 00:36:08,230
You fabricated orders
from the Three Provincial Commissions,

765
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:09,560
trying to confuse people.

766
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:12,670
Are you gonna defy Mr. Liu's order?

767
00:36:12,710 --> 00:36:14,710
