[Bless and Protect People Extensively]

190
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:01,540
[People's Court]

191
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:02,640
Your Excellencies,

192
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,670
I intended

193
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:06,550
to handle the matters in Linfen

194
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:07,840
and then rush to Taiyuan

195
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,520
to welcome you.

196
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:10,550
I didn't expect you

197
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:11,640
to suddenly arrive

198
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:13,640
in Linfen.

199
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:17,080
Mr. Liu,
there's no need for pleasantries.

200
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:18,760
We are here

201
00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:20,350
on imperial orders

202
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:23,520
to investigate
the disaster relief situation in Shanxi,

203
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:26,110
as well as the case
of stolen military grain

204
00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:27,790
and burned granary of Taiyuanwei.

205
00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:30,670
Mr. Liu, a few days ago,
you submitted a report

206
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:33,470
about Magistrate Han Muzhi's actions,

207
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:35,080
which the Emperor has reviewed

208
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:38,200
and has ordered us
to investigate thoroughly.

209
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:41,080
Please conduct a thorough investigation.

210
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:45,110
Where is Han Muzhi?

211
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:48,000
Han Muzhi?

212
00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:50,910
He bears heavy crimes
and shows no remorse,

213
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:52,400
and even defies superior orders.

214
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:53,320
I have already

215
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,790
brought out
the Imperial Banner and Tablet

216
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:56,000
to detain him.

217
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:57,880
He is awaiting execution.

218
00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:01,320
Bring Han Muzhi to the court.

219
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:05,180
[People's Court]

220
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:13,200
Greetings, Your Excellencies.

221
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,320
Han Muzhi,

222
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:16,550
in this year of disaster,

223
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:18,590
has anyone in Linfen starved to death?

224
00:15:19,470 --> 00:15:20,230
Yes.

225
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:21,200
How many?

226
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,670
Three hundred twenty-nine people.

227
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:24,110
So many people starved to death.

228
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:25,200
Do you know your crime?

229
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,320
Yes, I do.

230
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:28,350
I am the magistrate of Linfen.

231
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,520
Even if one commoner starves to death,

232
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,320
it is my fault.

233
00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:34,550
How could so many people starve?

234
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:36,470
The relief grain from the court

235
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,470
wasn't sent to you in full?

236
00:15:40,110 --> 00:15:41,790
I have a major case

237
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:43,520
to report.

238
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:44,880
What case? Go ahead!

239
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:47,550
The reason why so many people

240
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:48,910
starved to death in Linfen

241
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,110
is all due to the governor of Shanxi,

242
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:52,520
Mr. Liu.

243
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:54,030
Nonsense!

244
00:15:54,550 --> 00:15:55,320
How dare you

245
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:57,230
falsely accuse an imperial official?

246
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,760
Mr. Zhao, please remain calm.

247
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,640
Let's hear what he has to say.

248
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:03,400
If it truly is slander,

249
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:06,440
the imperial court
will not let him off lightly.

250
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:10,910
Han Muzhi,

251
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:13,230
you should come clean.

252
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,200
The root cause of the deaths

253
00:16:15,590 --> 00:16:16,590
of the victims in Linfen

254
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:18,280
is the struggle

255
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:19,320
between Mr. Liu and Governor Qi.

256
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:22,200
Mr. Liu took advantage of the disaster

257
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,590
to frame Governor Qi.

258
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:26,320
Nonsense!

259
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:28,110
Keep talking.

260
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:30,080
All of you know

261
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:31,910
that this year
has been a disaster in Shanxi,

262
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:32,960
and Linfen is the worst affected.

263
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:35,320
I organized people
to eliminate the locusts

264
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:37,080
and wrote to the provincial office,

265
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,710
requesting grain for disaster relief.

266
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,550
But it was like sinking into the sea.

267
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:42,640
The relief grain was delayed.

268
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,230
At this time,

269
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:46,080
victims from surrounding counties

270
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,400
flocked to Linfen.

271
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,710
I traveled all the way to Taiyuan,

272
00:16:49,710 --> 00:16:52,150
several times asking Mr. Liu for grain,

273
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:53,790
but he always made excuses.

274
00:16:54,590 --> 00:16:55,710
Meanwhile,

275
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:56,910
the merchant Qin Yi,

276
00:16:57,110 --> 00:16:59,670
who colluded with Mr. Liu,

277
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:01,150
monopolized the grain supply,

278
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,280
resulting in my inability

279
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:04,040
to secure even a grain of rice.

280
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:05,880
You're so ungrateful!

281
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:07,520
Mr. Liu betrothed

282
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,680
his beloved daughter to you,

283
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:10,800
yet you're trying frame him like this?

284
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:11,430
Silence!

285
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:13,520
If anyone makes a noise again,

286
00:17:13,590 --> 00:17:14,560
throw them out!

287
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:15,760
Yes.

288
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:20,430
Governor Qi's son, Qi Menglin,

289
00:17:20,950 --> 00:17:22,830
once served
as the Deputy Commandant of Pingyangwei,

290
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,110
stationed in Linfen.

291
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:25,680
Unable to bear

292
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:27,800
watching the people of Linfen
starve to death,

293
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,350
he used Governor Qi's name

294
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:31,430
to secretly transport
two ships of military grain.

295
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:33,640
He planned to deliver it to Linfen

296
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:35,470
to alleviate
the urgent needs of the people.

297
00:17:35,710 --> 00:17:37,040
However, during transport,

298
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:38,230
the shipment was swapped.

299
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:40,190
By the time it arrived in Linfen,

300
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:42,190
it had turned
into two ships of rice husks.

301
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:43,800
That very night,

302
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,470
the granary of Taiyuanwei

303
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:47,590
was set ablaze.

304
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:51,000
Do you know who swapped the grain?

305
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:53,430
Who destroyed the granary?

306
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:54,760
It was Qin Yi.

307
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,710
But Qin Yi
had another mastermind behind him.

308
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:58,880
Who was the mastermind?

309
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,070
Whoever benefits
by bringing down Governor Qi

310
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:03,400
is the one behind it.

311
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,190
Are you implying that it's Liu Yiqing?

312
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,190
Exactly.

313
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,310
Your Excellencies,

314
00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:21,230
what Han Muzhi just said

315
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:23,310
is all nonsense.

316
00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:25,520
Qin Yi and Governor Qi

317
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:26,560
have colluded for years,

318
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:28,920
trafficking military grain,
salt, and iron.

319
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:30,880
Taking advantage of this disaster

320
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,830
in Shanxi,

321
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,350
they stole from their own.

322
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,230
They emptied

323
00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:37,230
the granary of Taiyuanwei,

324
00:18:37,230 --> 00:18:38,640
and fearing
the court would discover this,

325
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:41,830
they set fire to cover their tracks.

326
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:45,350
I implore you to investigate thoroughly.

327
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:46,920
Qin Yi?

328
00:18:48,430 --> 00:18:49,280
So you're saying

329
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,560
he is the key to this case?

330
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:53,560
Where is Qin Yi now?

331
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:55,000
Bring him up!

332
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:57,520
Han Muzhi,

333
00:18:58,110 --> 00:18:59,470
you just said

334
00:18:59,710 --> 00:19:01,070
that Qin Yi colluded with me,

335
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:03,710
but where is Qin Yi now?

336
00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:05,430
You know well.

337
00:19:07,430 --> 00:19:08,830
Qin Yi is dead.

338
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:13,400
What a perfect excuse for no evidence!

339
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:15,590
Though Qin Yi is dead,

340
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,070
there may still be witnesses.

341
00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:21,950
Call the Shanxi Provincial
Administration Commission Interrogator,

342
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:23,070
Sun Qian.

343
00:19:28,430 --> 00:19:29,110
I am Sun Qian,

344
00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:31,680
the Shanxi Provincial
Administration Commission Interrogator.

345
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:32,880
Greetings, Your Excellencies,

346
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:34,070
Mr. Liu,

347
00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:35,310
and Mr. Zhao.

348
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:36,560
Sun Qian,

349
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,230
you led us here,

350
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:41,040
claiming to know about the case.

351
00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:42,560
So, speak up now.

352
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,280
Your Excellency,

353
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,560
the fire at the granary of Taiyuanwei

354
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:48,680
was caused by Lian Qi.

355
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,070
He was a spy

356
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:51,710
who Qin Yi planted

357
00:19:51,710 --> 00:19:53,430
in the Qi Mansion years ago.

358
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:54,950
Where is Lian Qi now?

359
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:56,400
He is dead.

360
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:57,400
That man

361
00:19:57,590 --> 00:19:59,000
was Qin Yi's brother.

362
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,400
What does this prove?

363
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:02,520
Sun Qian,

364
00:20:02,710 --> 00:20:03,950
before the envoys,

365
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,640
you can't ramble on.

366
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:06,800
Your Excellencies,

367
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:07,710
there is still a witness

368
00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:08,680
waiting outside.

369
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:10,680
I request to summon her.

370
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,350
What is her name?

371
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,520
Her name is Ru Yan.

372
00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:15,470
Summon her.

373
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:18,070
Summon Ru Yan to the court.

374
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:28,520
I am Ru Yan.

375
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:30,000
Greetings, Your Excellencies.

376
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:33,190
That day, Qi Menglin

377
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:34,470
falsely claimed
to hold the orders of Governor Qi

378
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:35,590
to get grain from the granary.

379
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:37,280
This was already against the law.

380
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:38,310
But Qin Yi

381
00:20:38,310 --> 00:20:40,070
had already bribed the granary officer,

382
00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:41,760
which allowed Qi Menglin

383
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,230
to successfully transport the grain.

384
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:44,470
However,

385
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:46,280
the granary officer
was already silenced.

386
00:20:47,310 --> 00:20:48,110
Ru Yan,

387
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:50,110
please tell us everything you know.

388
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:52,310
Your Excellency,

389
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:54,110
I was indeed

390
00:20:54,110 --> 00:20:55,560
the lover of that granary officer.

391
00:20:56,190 --> 00:20:57,590
He once told me

392
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:59,070
that Qin Yi

393
00:20:59,110 --> 00:21:00,590
gave him a large sum of money

394
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,110
to do something significant.

395
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:05,070
He also said that once this was done,

396
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,230
he would redeem me.

397
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:07,470
Redeem you?

398
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:11,560
I am a musician from Yuchun Music House.

399
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:14,520
A person of such lowly status

400
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:16,160
can meet the imperial envoys?

401
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:18,800
What good fortune!

402
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:22,160
Even if it was Qin Yi

403
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:23,230
who had the grain swapped

404
00:21:23,230 --> 00:21:24,800
and the granary burned,

405
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:27,430
what does that have to do with me?

406
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:29,760
Han Muzhi,

407
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:32,350
if you have no evidence

408
00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:33,430
and are just speaking nonsense,

409
00:21:34,070 --> 00:21:35,710
besides neglecting the relief efforts,

410
00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:37,430
and defying superior orders,

411
00:21:37,950 --> 00:21:40,230
I will also charge you

412
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,230
with the crime
of slandering your superior.

413
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:45,590
Han Muzhi, and Sun Qian,

414
00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:47,710
do you have

415
00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:48,950
any evidence or witnesses

416
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:51,590
to prove that Mr. Liu and Qin Yi

417
00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:53,000
colluded to frame the Qi family?

418
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:54,880
Qin Yi had a henchman

419
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:56,040
named Peng Cheng,

420
00:21:56,470 --> 00:21:57,190
who not only knew

421
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:58,230
all the illegal things

422
00:21:58,230 --> 00:21:59,760
Qin Yi did,

423
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:01,430
but was also instructed

424
00:22:01,430 --> 00:22:02,590
to assassinate me.

425
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:04,590
Fortunately, I captured him,

426
00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:06,350
and he is in the jail here.

427
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,070
Bring Peng Cheng up!

428
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:14,070
Your Excellencies,
this person does exist.

429
00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:15,920
However, Peng Cheng

430
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:17,920
suddenly fell ill in prison.

431
00:22:18,110 --> 00:22:19,000
He is dead.

432
00:22:19,310 --> 00:22:21,590
Was it indeed sudden illness,

433
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:24,590
or was it a murder to silence him?

434
00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:25,760
It was sudden illness.

435
00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:27,800
It really was.

436
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:38,070
Your Excellency,

437
00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:39,000
there is a woman outside,

438
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:39,880
who claims to be Luo Shu.

439
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:40,430
She is beating the drum,

440
00:22:40,430 --> 00:22:41,400
saying she has important information.

441
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:42,830
She also has a witness with her.

442
00:22:44,350 --> 00:22:45,400
Your Excellency,

443
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:46,680
Luo Shu was a constable

444
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:48,190
at the Linfen Yamen.

445
00:22:48,190 --> 00:22:49,190
She has assisted me

446
00:22:49,190 --> 00:22:50,310
in solving many cases,

447
00:22:50,310 --> 00:22:52,190
and is well-regarded in Linfen.

448
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:53,400
A female constable?

449
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:54,280
Bring her up.

450
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:54,880
Yes.

451
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:12,110
I'm Luo Shu.

452
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:13,230
Greetings, Your Excellency.

453
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:14,800
Your Excellency.

454
00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:15,920
This is

455
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:17,230
the person you're looking for,
Peng Cheng.

456
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:24,880
Xu.

457
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:26,640
This won't harm him, right?

458
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:27,400
Don't worry.

459
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:29,400
He'll wake up in 24 hours.

460
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:32,830
Mr. Zhao.

461
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:36,040
You just said Peng Cheng died in jail

462
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:38,040
from a sudden severe illness

463
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,160
What about now?

464
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,310
Is he alive again?

465
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,070
Your Excellency,

466
00:23:43,310 --> 00:23:44,830
I have never had any severe illness.

467
00:23:45,310 --> 00:23:47,760
Someone just wanted to silence me.

468
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,430
Luckily, I survived.

469
00:24:01,230 --> 00:24:02,920
I'm sure you've heard

470
00:24:03,190 --> 00:24:04,040
that Qin Yi is dead.

471
00:24:05,590 --> 00:24:06,470
So what?

472
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,920
Do you want to take his place?

473
00:24:09,430 --> 00:24:10,560
Qin Yi's fate today

474
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:11,880
could be yours tomorrow.

475
00:24:12,590 --> 00:24:14,400
And you're in jail now.

476
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:16,520
Mr. Liu definitely won't save you.

477
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:18,190
He'll just want to eliminate you.

478
00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:20,710
If you want to live,

479
00:24:21,310 --> 00:24:22,430
I can help you.

480
00:24:26,070 --> 00:24:27,160
You, Mr. Qi,

481
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:28,230
and Han Muzhi

482
00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:29,400
are all in danger.

483
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,680
Why should I believe your nonsense?

484
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:33,110
Your life is your own.

485
00:24:33,470 --> 00:24:34,590
It's up to you.

486
00:24:35,590 --> 00:24:37,000
Let's take a gamble.

487
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:41,000
Take this, and you'll look dead.

488
00:24:41,310 --> 00:24:43,190
You'll wake up in 24 hours.

489
00:24:43,350 --> 00:24:46,110
Whether to gamble or not,
it's your call.

490
00:24:54,590 --> 00:24:56,280
Zhao Gongming wants to kill me.

491
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:57,430
Don't frame me.

492
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,160
When did I ever

493
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:00,760
lift a finger?

494
00:25:02,070 --> 00:25:03,110
You

495
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:04,800
are just a tool for murder.

496
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:07,280
The real one who wants to silence me

497
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:10,950
is Mr. Liu.

498
00:25:12,830 --> 00:25:13,710
Mr. Liu,

499
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:16,190
do you have anything to say?

500
00:25:20,430 --> 00:25:23,310
I did send Mr. Zhao

501
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:25,280
to the jail.

502
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:28,710
But I just wanted to see

503
00:25:29,230 --> 00:25:31,070
if the one who tried
to kill Magistrate Han

504
00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:33,070
was okay.

505
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,830
After all, such a major criminal

506
00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:38,590
needs to be escorted
to the capital for trial.

507
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:40,920
If he died here,

508
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:42,640
it would be a problem for me.

509
00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:43,470
He's lying.

510
00:25:43,470 --> 00:25:44,430
You're out of line.

511
00:25:46,190 --> 00:25:47,400
Your Excellencies,

512
00:25:47,710 --> 00:25:49,000
the assassination of Magistrate Han

513
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:51,040
was ordered by Mr. Liu.

514
00:25:52,430 --> 00:25:55,470
I was once under Qin Yi,

515
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:57,000
but later switched to Mr. Liu.

516
00:25:57,590 --> 00:25:58,920
I know everything about the collusion

517
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:00,230
between Qin Yi and Liu.

518
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:02,000
Then tell us everything

519
00:26:02,190 --> 00:26:03,280
straight up.

520
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:04,920
Your Excellencies,

521
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:07,520
Qin Yi

522
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:09,760
has worked with the Qi family for years

523
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:11,680
to sell salt, iron, and grain.

524
00:26:12,190 --> 00:26:14,680
Later, he got bolder,

525
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:17,230
selling goods secretly to the border.

526
00:26:17,230 --> 00:26:19,070
Governor Qi worried about the fire
coming to him

527
00:26:20,190 --> 00:26:22,190
and cut ties with Qin Yi.

528
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,110
Qin Yi, not willing to let go,

529
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,040
was resentful,

530
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,350
so he turned to Mr. Liu.

531
00:26:28,710 --> 00:26:29,830
As a sign of loyalty,

532
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:32,230
Qin Yi personally planned

533
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:33,950
the use of rice husks for military grain

534
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:35,920
and the burning of the granary.

535
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:39,400
Then Mr. Liu worried Qin Yi

536
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:40,520
might become too powerful,

537
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:41,950
so he pulled me in.

538
00:26:42,190 --> 00:26:44,800
He promised to support me
to replace Qin Yi.

539
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:45,950
Mr. Liu.

540
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:48,430
Your Excellency.

541
00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:53,920
This man was locked up
in the Linfen jail.

542
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:56,560
He must have been turned

543
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:57,920
by Han Muzhi and his associates.

544
00:26:58,710 --> 00:27:01,280
That's why he's framing me.

545
00:27:01,430 --> 00:27:03,400
No, I'm not framing him.

546
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:05,680
Mr. Liu is the real culprit.

547
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:07,430
You say I'm the culprit,

548
00:27:07,430 --> 00:27:08,520
is that really true?

549
00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:11,350
You say I told you

550
00:27:11,350 --> 00:27:12,880
to assassinate Han Muzhi.

551
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,880
So I'm the mastermind now?

552
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:16,350
Where's the evidence?

553
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:18,070
Where's the evidence?

554
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,310
Your Excellencies,

555
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:21,160
Peng Cheng is the evidence.

556
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:23,160
Everything I said is true.

557
00:27:24,110 --> 00:27:25,520
If any part is false,

558
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:27,430
I'll accept any punishment.

559
00:27:27,430 --> 00:27:29,230
This is baseless, Your Excellency.

560
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:31,350
If you take

561
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:32,680
his one-sided words as the truth

562
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
and ruin my reputation,

563
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:37,160
I'll have to submit a memorial

564
00:27:37,350 --> 00:27:39,070
to His Majesty for a ruling.

565
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:42,280
After all, life is minor,

566
00:27:42,950 --> 00:27:44,310
but reputation is crucial.

567
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:51,470
Peng Cheng can be a witness.

568
00:27:51,950 --> 00:27:54,880
Do you have any physical evidence?

569
00:27:57,230 --> 00:27:58,350
Your Excellency,

570
00:27:58,950 --> 00:28:01,160
I have done my best,

571
00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:02,880
but my power is limited.

572
00:28:04,070 --> 00:28:05,590
I urge you to investigate thoroughly.

573
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,280
Then, the reality will show itself.

574
00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:09,280
Justice has long arms.

575
00:28:09,710 --> 00:28:11,710
The truth will be revealed one day.

576
00:28:11,710 --> 00:28:13,280
Just say it directly.

577
00:28:13,430 --> 00:28:14,680
You either have it,

578
00:28:14,950 --> 00:28:16,430
or you don't.

579
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:17,520
Han Muzhi,

580
00:28:18,310 --> 00:28:20,160
don't mislead

581
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,430
the court.

582
00:28:22,590 --> 00:28:23,470
I have evidence.

583
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:39,800
Wan, what are you doing here?

584
00:28:41,950 --> 00:28:43,680
This is court. No nonsense allowed.

585
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:45,070
Go home.

586
00:28:46,310 --> 00:28:47,040
Your Excellency.

587
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:48,160
This is...

588
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,000
Your Excellencies,

589
00:28:51,110 --> 00:28:52,230
I am Liu Wan,

590
00:28:52,950 --> 00:28:55,560
daughter of Liu Yiqing,
the Shanxi provincial governor.

591
00:28:57,590 --> 00:28:58,400
Miss Liu,

592
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:00,230
what do you have to say?

593
00:29:00,470 --> 00:29:01,350
Speak boldly.

594
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:09,680
Father,

595
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:13,070
please allow me to bow to you.

596
00:29:16,350 --> 00:29:17,160
Wan.

597
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:21,470
I am unfilial,

598
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:25,560
and I don't dare to ask
for your forgiveness.

599
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,760
But regarding today's matter,

600
00:29:28,190 --> 00:29:29,800
if I keep silent,

601
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,110
and don't report what I know,

602
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:33,560
I fear that later on

603
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:35,430
you will only trapped deeper,

604
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:37,160
causing harm to yourself and the people.

605
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,880
Even if you have power and wealth,

606
00:29:41,430 --> 00:29:43,310
what good is it

607
00:29:43,710 --> 00:29:45,110
if you can't have a single day of peace?

608
00:29:46,470 --> 00:29:47,110
Father,

609
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,520
you've always doted on me.

610
00:29:50,350 --> 00:29:52,280
Please listen to me this time.

611
00:29:53,950 --> 00:29:55,280
I'm willing to share the blame

612
00:29:55,830 --> 00:29:57,280
with you.

613
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,520
I just hope

614
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:01,830
you can turn over a new leaf,

615
00:30:02,230 --> 00:30:03,230
and stop before it's too late.

616
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:05,880
Be unburdened by guilt

617
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:08,110
and stay pure.

618
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:39,590
All matters in Shanxi have been exposed.

619
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:41,160
The Emperor is furious

620
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:42,800
and severe punishments await.

621
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:44,830
Though Qin Yi perished in the fire,

622
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:46,640
he engaged in smuggling salt and iron,

623
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:47,920
colluded with the enemy,

624
00:30:48,190 --> 00:30:49,590
and committed acts of rebellion.

625
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:51,280
His crimes were serious.

626
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:53,950
Hence, his property was confiscated
and turned over to the treasury.

627
00:30:54,470 --> 00:30:56,110
Qi Zongyue, the Xuanfu-Datong Governor,

628
00:30:56,310 --> 00:30:57,190
colluded with unscrupulous merchants,

629
00:30:57,190 --> 00:30:59,000
[Bless and Protect People Extensively]
and engaged in embezzlement.

630
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:00,590
So he was lawfully dismissed
and investigated.

631
00:31:00,590 --> 00:31:02,950
His property was confiscated,
and he was exiled 8,000 li.

632
00:31:03,310 --> 00:31:04,880
Liu Yiqing,
the Shanxi provincial governor,

633
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:07,070
colluded with Zhao Gongming,
the administrative commissioner,

634
00:31:07,110 --> 00:31:09,280
abused power for personal gain,
defied orders to provide relief,

635
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:10,830
and carried out unauthorized punishments
and executions.

636
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:12,920
Since Liu Yiqing had served
a long time on the frontier

637
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:14,590
and could be reformed,

638
00:31:14,710 --> 00:31:16,520
and his daughter,
Wan, showed filial piety

639
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:17,680
and understood righteousness,

640
00:31:17,950 --> 00:31:19,230
he was granted special leniency

641
00:31:19,350 --> 00:31:20,760
and spared from death

642
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:21,880
but he lost his position,

643
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:22,900
received 20 lashes,

644
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:24,470
[Linfen]
and was exiled 3,000 li.

645
00:31:24,470 --> 00:31:26,190
Zhao Gongming received 100 lashes

646
00:31:26,190 --> 00:31:28,680
and was reduced to commoner status,
never to hold office again.

647
00:31:29,070 --> 00:31:30,590
[Good Weather for Bumper Harvest]
Qi Menglin forged the document

648
00:31:30,590 --> 00:31:31,640
and privately released military grain.

649
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:33,000
Though illegal,

650
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,470
his actions were to save the people,

651
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:35,950
so this was considered.

652
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,560
The Emperor specially decreed
to exempt him from death,

653
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:40,280
and he was exiled 2,000 li.

654
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,310
Han Muzhi, the magistrate of Linfen,

655
00:31:42,350 --> 00:31:43,470
couldn't help the people effectively,

656
00:31:43,470 --> 00:31:45,110
but he did try his best as an official

657
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:46,310
to serve the people.

658
00:31:46,310 --> 00:31:48,710
In the end,
he was spared from punishment.

659

[Two Years Later, Somewhere]

660
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:38,280
Mr. Han.

661
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:52,400
Two years.

662
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:56,230
I've been looking for you for two years.

663
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:00,710
How have you been?

664
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:07,800
Your father has been gone
for over a year.

665
00:33:09,230 --> 00:33:11,040
He was always proud.

666
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:15,160
After that day,
he fell ill and never recovered.

667
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:17,710
As his daughter,

668
00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:19,950
I let him down

669
00:33:19,950 --> 00:33:21,400
in the end.

670
00:33:24,950 --> 00:33:26,070
It's nice here,

671
00:33:26,830 --> 00:33:27,800
very quiet.

672
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:30,710
I recite scriptures
for my father every day,

673
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:32,430
and it has helped me find peace.

674
00:33:33,350 --> 00:33:34,710
Mr. Han, don't worry.

675
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:41,760
I'm heading to the capital.

676
00:33:45,950 --> 00:33:47,520
Congratulations on your promotion.

677
00:33:52,350 --> 00:33:53,880
If there's nothing else,

678
00:33:54,830 --> 00:33:56,160
you can go back.

679
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:02,710
This is the sachet you gave me that day.

680
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:05,590
I've kept it

681
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:07,560
with me.

682
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:17,150
When we first met
and got to know each other,

683
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:22,520
our feelings just developed naturally,

684
00:34:23,870 --> 00:34:24,870
and they run deep.

685
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,560
If you can't untie the knot
in your heart,

686
00:34:31,470 --> 00:34:32,470
I'll wait for you.

687

If I can't wait for you in this life,

00:34:38,670 --> 00:34:39,710
then in the next.

Where is Magistrate Han?

the food will get cold.

00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:13,840
Yeah.

00:35:13,870 --> 00:35:14,630
We're waiting for him to come back

so we can see him off
and have New Year's Eve dinner together.

Magistrate Han said

699
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:18,870
we don't need to wait for him.

700
00:35:19,710 --> 00:35:20,470
How can that be?

701
00:35:20,470 --> 00:35:22,120
This New Year's Eve dinner
is for reunion.

702
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,470
It won't be complete without him.

703
00:35:23,470 --> 00:35:24,800
Why are you complaining?

704
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:25,600
Magistrate Han has

705
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:26,760
his own wishes to fulfill.

706
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,120
Let's hope he gets what he wants.

708
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:31,520
Alright then.

in the kitchen.

if Mrs. Qi hadn't managed

750
00:37:07,950 --> 00:37:09,040
everything here,

751
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:10,430
you wouldn't be so comfortable now.

752
00:37:10,950 --> 00:37:12,520
You'd have been sent to the frontier.

753
00:37:12,710 --> 00:37:13,870
Shut your mouth!

754
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:15,430
If I knew you were so chatty,

755
00:37:15,910 --> 00:37:16,710
I wouldn't have

756
00:37:16,870 --> 00:37:17,600
let her

757
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:18,360
bring you over.

758
00:37:20,150 --> 00:37:20,950
Take it!

759
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:29,950
Mr. Qi!

760
00:37:29,950 --> 00:37:30,800
Mr. Wang!

761
00:37:31,230 --> 00:37:32,520
I was just looking for you.

762
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:33,230
Really?

763
00:37:34,190 --> 00:37:35,630
Here, take it inside.

764
00:37:36,950 --> 00:37:37,760
Mr. Qi,

765
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:39,870
I feel like

766
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:41,760
Mrs. Qi will be back

767
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:43,150
soon.

768
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:43,910
Yes.

769
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:44,670
Just wait.

770
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:45,870
I have something here.

771
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:50,280
It's all good.

772
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:51,080
I'll take care of it.

773
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:51,670
This is...

774
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,520
I saved some charcoal

775
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:56,600
for Mrs. Qi.

776
00:37:56,710 --> 00:37:57,600
You can burn it worry-free.

777
00:37:57,870 --> 00:37:59,760
Not a bit of smoke will rise.

778
00:38:00,670 --> 00:38:01,430
Thanks a lot!

779
00:38:01,430 --> 00:38:02,150
No problem!

780
00:38:02,430 --> 00:38:03,080
What's this?

781
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:03,760
Here.

782
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:04,390
No.

783
00:38:04,390 --> 00:38:05,000
Take it.

784
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:05,360
No.

785
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:06,080
Take it.

786
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:06,560
How can I...?

787
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:07,000
Take it.

788
00:38:08,390 --> 00:38:09,320
Look at you.

789
00:38:09,710 --> 00:38:10,710
You're so strong!

790
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:13,230
You've got me beat.

791
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:16,430
What I mean is,

792
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,800
when you first came here,

793
00:38:18,870 --> 00:38:21,950
you were barely hanging on,

794
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:24,190
so skinny, like a little chick.

795
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:25,800
You could hardly walk straight.

796
00:38:25,950 --> 00:38:27,280
Luckily, Mrs. Qi

797
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:28,470
bought you

798
00:38:28,470 --> 00:38:29,760
all those expensive medicinal herbs,

799
00:38:30,190 --> 00:38:32,800
like ginseng and deer antler.

800
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:33,230
Yeah.

801
00:38:33,230 --> 00:38:34,150
And that...

802
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:35,390
Liaodong sea cucumber.

803
00:38:35,390 --> 00:38:36,320
Exactly!

804
00:38:36,870 --> 00:38:38,870
She kept nourishing you
more like a waterfall.

805
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:41,800
You've gone through quite a bit
of good stuff.

806
00:38:43,630 --> 00:38:44,870
You look so strong now!

807
00:38:46,910 --> 00:38:47,710
Mr. Wang,

808
00:38:48,710 --> 00:38:49,760
what do you want to say?

809
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:52,600
I just want to chat with you.

810
00:38:53,630 --> 00:38:55,470
You're a lucky man.

811
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:56,320
Yeah!

812
00:38:56,630 --> 00:38:57,840
You must have good ancestors.

813
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:59,190
So you got

814
00:38:59,190 --> 00:39:00,000
such a great wife!

815
00:39:00,390 --> 00:39:02,280
She's amazing, treats you well,

816
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:04,670
and she knows how to make money.

817
00:39:05,470 --> 00:39:07,150
Look at how well

818
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:09,470
her business is doing!

819
00:39:13,910 --> 00:39:14,710
Just get to the point.

820
00:39:16,670 --> 00:39:17,910
Alright, I'll be direct.

821
00:39:17,950 --> 00:39:18,760
Go ahead.

822
00:39:19,670 --> 00:39:23,150
My wife has been feeling
a bit weak lately,

823
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:26,520
and I wanted
to ask Mrs. Qi for a ginseng.

824
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:28,040
Is that okay?

825
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:30,080
I thought it was a big deal.

826
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:30,950
You don't even need to ask her.

827
00:39:30,950 --> 00:39:32,120
I have some great ginseng at my place.

828
00:39:32,230 --> 00:39:33,040
Really?

829
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:33,630
I'll have Lian Shu

830
00:39:33,630 --> 00:39:34,230
bring it over.

831
00:39:34,230 --> 00:39:35,520
Thanks, Mr. Qi.

832
00:39:36,430 --> 00:39:37,230
Mr. Qi!

833
00:39:37,430 --> 00:39:38,430
Charcoal!

834
00:39:39,390 --> 00:39:40,230
Oh, I forgot!

835
00:39:40,710 --> 00:39:41,430
What are you doing?

836
00:39:41,430 --> 00:39:42,360
Put it away!

837
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:43,080
Put it away!

838
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:43,710
No.

839
00:39:43,710 --> 00:39:44,190
I'll bring you the ginseng

840
00:39:44,190 --> 00:39:44,950
later!

841
00:39:47,710 --> 00:39:49,150
He's really a good person!

842
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:06,320
Young Master!

843
00:40:08,390 --> 00:40:09,320
Luo Shu is back?

844
00:40:09,670 --> 00:40:10,470
Not yet.

845
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:12,150
But it's snowing outside,

846
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:13,470
pretty hard.

847
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:20,150
Young Master,

848
00:40:20,910 --> 00:40:21,840
do you think Mrs. Qi

849
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:22,760
will come back today?

850
00:40:26,710 --> 00:40:27,600
Maybe it's better if she doesn't.

851
00:40:29,390 --> 00:40:30,800
With this heavy snow, she might freeze.

852
00:40:33,390 --> 00:40:34,870
But you're always

853
00:40:34,870 --> 00:40:36,280
either worrying about your father

854
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:37,760
or anxiously waiting

855
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:38,950
