00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:28,320
[Under the Moonlight]

2
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,700
[Adapted from the novel "Jin Nang" by Shui He]

3
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:33,020
[Episode 17]

4
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,040
You are the magistrate.

5
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:36,760
The livelihoods of the people

6
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:37,760
depend on you.

7
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:40,310
I do not expect
to be with you every moment.

8
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:43,000
I just want to cherish the present.

9
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:49,120
"If love between both sides
can last for aye,

10
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,360
Why need they
stay together night and day?"

11
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:53,870
Compared to that,

12
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:55,040
I prefer this line:

13
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:56,760
"When Autumn's Golden wind
embraces Dew of Jades,

14
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:58,720
All the love scenes on earth,
however many, fade."

15
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,440
In truth,
Qin Shaoyou could write graceful verses,

16
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,190
yet he also cared for the people.

17
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,510
At a young age, he wrote

18
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:08,960
the poem about Guo Ziyi
riding out alone to face the enemy.

19
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:11,750
Later, with Su Shi's encouragement,

20
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:13,630
even after failing twice,

21
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:15,190
he did not lose his ambition.

22
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:17,240
In the end, he achieved his wish,

23
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,470
becoming a successful candidate.

24
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:20,520
And then?

25
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:22,600
Later on,

26
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:24,910
thanks to Su Shi's recommendation,

27
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:27,030
Qin Shaoyou was promoted
from a clerk in Dinghai

28
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:28,360
to a professor in Caizhou,

29
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:29,960
and then to a doctor
at the Imperial Academy.

30
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:32,110
Later, he moved to the Palace Library.

31
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,160
It seems that for a thoroughbred

32
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,320
to gallop freely,

33
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:37,440
it needs a discerning connoisseur.

34
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,360
That is only natural.

35
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,190
I am not a thoroughbred,

36
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:48,910
and I don't need any connoisseur.

37
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:51,320
I only wish to do my best

38
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:53,190
to do something practical
for the people.

39
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,550
Even if I end up

40
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:55,550
as a minor official,

41
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:56,910
I would still find joy in it.

42
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:01,080
As long as I have you by my side,
that's enough.

43
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:05,630
What?

44
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,830
The magistrate has left with Miss Luo?

45
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,440
What are they doing?

46
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:11,520
How do you know this?

47
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,160
Of course, they're out for a date.

48
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:14,630
Could they be solving a case?

49
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:16,960
I heard it from the coachman, Sun.

50
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,880
After finishing his class at the school,

51
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,720
the magistrate let Sun back

52
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:23,600
and personally drove Luo Shu away.

53
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:24,630
So it seems

54
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,110
he really wants to be

55
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:26,800
with Miss Luo.

56
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,190
They are a match made in heaven.

57
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,160
That's wonderful!

58
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:36,630
Well, not necessarily.

59
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:39,600
I heard
that the magistrate is already engaged

60
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,670
to Mr. Liu's daughter.

61
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,720
So what if he's engaged?

62
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,240
That doesn't mean
they're officially married yet.

63
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,670
They can just break off the engagement.

64
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,000
It's not as simple as you say.

65
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:49,080
Just think about it.

66
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,830
Being the son-in-law of Mr. Liu,

67
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:51,720
what a promising future!

68
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:52,670
And marrying a commoner,

69
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:53,800
what kind of future is that?

70
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:55,600
Moreover,

71
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:57,190
the removal papers are still pending.

72
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,320
Miss Luo is beautiful, kind-hearted,

73
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,190
and clever.

74
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,720
She is not inferior
to the governor's daughter.

75
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,830
"You are so tender,
though of pale, light yellow hue;

76
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:28,390
Far from caress of heart and hand,
fragrant are you."

77
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:36,600
"How can you need
the color of rose or green jade?

78
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,350
Beside you
there're no beautiful flowers but fade."

79
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,320
Baozi,

80
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,720
you are so naive.

81
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:01,480
What is most important for a man?

82
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:02,950
It's his career, his future.

83
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:04,830
My sister is just a young girl.

84
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:05,950
That's not called naivety.

85
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:07,040
That's called innocence.

86
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,320
Moreover, my sister isn't wrong.

87
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,070
As for Miss Luo,

88
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:11,600
she stands out among women.

89
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:17,110
Aren't you being too idle?

90
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,510
Daring to gossip
about the magistrate's personal matters?

91
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,040
Mr. Chen, you've finally returned!

92
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,440
Let me get you some utensils.

93
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:25,830
Didn't you go home to rest?

94
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:27,070
Why not stay at home

95
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:27,950
a few more days?

96
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:29,830
I finished
taking care of things at home.

97
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:31,950
I need to focus again.

98
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:33,950
There's a pile of official duties here.

99
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,600
I can't relax at home.

100
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,480
Right, that makes sense.

101
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:39,000
These matters, big and small,

102
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,230
truly need you.

103
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:41,790
Don't flatter me with nice words.

104
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,270
From now on,

105
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:45,000
no one is allowed to gossip
about the magistrate behind his back.

106
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:46,670
Alright.

107
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:48,040
Please take a seat.

108
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:49,790
Please forgive us, Mr. Chen.

109
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,720
We are just concerned

110
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,230
about Miss Luo and the magistrate.

111
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:54,070
Exactly.

112
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,320
The magistrate

113
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,550
has always been kind to us.

114
00:05:56,550 --> 00:05:58,000
Miss Luo has a good personality.

115
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,640
She feels like family to us.

116
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:00,550
We all hope

117
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:02,000
for a good outcome for her.

118
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:02,510
Right?

119
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:03,270
Right?

120
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:08,790
Everyone has their own choices,

121
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:12,160
and should bear
the consequences of those choices.

122
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:17,550
Mr. Han

123
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:19,480
is indeed knowledgeable and capable.

124
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:22,230
Listening to him today

125
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:23,790
is worth ten years of study.

126
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:25,760
Mr. Han

127
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,230
is a two-time top scholar

128
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:28,110
appointed by the Emperor.

129
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:29,230
Back in the day,

130
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:31,160
he was riding high on success,

131
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:33,000
seeing all the flowers
in the capital in a single day.

132
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:33,880
Indeed!

133
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:36,720
Now it's even more impressive.

134
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:38,000
He governs a region,

135
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,600
with a boundless future.

136
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,600
Well said.

137
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,950
Who knows how many scholars envy him,

138
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:44,790
[The Story of the Pipa]
and how many women admire him?

Gentlemen,

141
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,230
what would you like to drink?

142
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,040
A pot of large-leaf tea.

143
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:54,550
Sure, please wait a moment.

144
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:58,110
Young Master, just ahead

145
00:06:58,110 --> 00:06:59,440
is the entrance to the yamen.

146
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:00,720
Are you looking for Chief Luo?

147
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,950
Who said I'm looking for her?

148
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:03,390
I'm going to visit my old friends

149
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:04,670
like Captain Cai, Cai Baozi, and Mr. Xu.

150
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,920
Chief Luo is also your old friend.

151
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:25,640
Are we going or not, Young Master?

152
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:32,510
Let's go back.

153
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:43,460
[Dear Mr. Liu]

154
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,480
Dear Mr. Liu,

155
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:01,510
I have received your favor,

156
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:03,480
and was invited to be your son-in-law.

157
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:06,350
I am just a humble scholar,

158
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:07,600
unworthy of it.

159
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:34,030
Young Master,

160
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:36,080
this is a treasured edition.

161
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:37,550
If you burn it today,

162
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:39,000
you won't be able to buy it again.

163
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,440
Starting tomorrow,

164
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:56,080
I will no longer read stories.

165
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,440
I will study hard.

166
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,000
I don't believe

167
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,790
only that guy named Han

168
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,710
can do it.

169
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:03,790
I can do it too.

170
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:07,470
Young Master,
you really want to study hard?

171
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:08,280
Yes.

172
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,790
But you still need to buy books.

173
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,760
Bad news, Muzhi.

174
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:18,110
Read it yourself.

175
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:26,620
[To Han Muzhi]

176
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:46,640
Mr. Liu is inspecting
the water management in the province.

177
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:48,880
He will soon arrive in Linfen.

178
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,400
He wants you to report

179
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,110
on the case
of the Mantian Ridge Coal Mine.

180
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:54,200
He intends to take away
witnesses for the Eunuch Zhang case.

181
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:57,350
There's no need
to arrange special lodging for him.

182
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:59,400
He can stay at the yamen.

183
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:01,790
This is not good.

184
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:10,080
Since Mr. Liu claims

185
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,320
to be here for official business,

186
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:14,150
we should receive him fairly.

187
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:15,960
But since he'll stay at the yamen,

188
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:16,910
it's not just

189
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:18,230
a simple matter.

190
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:19,910
Your future father-in-law

191
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:21,590
has never been easy to deal with.

192
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:23,440
He might have heard something,

193
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,470
and is on alert.

194
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,200
Miss Luo,

195
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:37,440
where did you and the magistrate

196
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,550
go for fun yesterday?

197
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,280
How do you know?

198
00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:41,470
Not just me,

199
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:42,790
the whole yamen knows.

200
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:45,000
But we all like

201
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,350
that you are with the magistrate.

202
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:53,230
But Mr. Qi hasn't been here

203
00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:54,440
for a long time.

204
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:55,960
Aren't you tired of his chatter?

205
00:10:56,470 --> 00:10:57,880
Although Mr. Qi talks a lot,

206
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:59,110
he is still quite a good person.

207
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:03,760
Your Honor.

208
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,400
Are you hungry, Your Honor?

209
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:10,440
The meal isn't ready yet.

210
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:12,640
I'm not hungry.

211
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:14,000
I came to find Luo Shu.

212
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,320
You have something to discuss with me?

213
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:35,880
Mr. Liu is coming to Linfen.

214
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,230
He will stay at the yamen.

215
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,470
He's here to inspect water management

216
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,320
and investigate the Eunuch Zhang case

217
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:44,840
related to Qian Dayou.

218
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,590
If he asks about personal matters,

219
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:49,880
I will explain to him.

220
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:51,960
You and his daughter...

221
00:11:52,590 --> 00:11:53,710
If he asks about personal matters,

222
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:54,710
it's to be expected.

223
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:01,880
About the cancellation
of the engagement,

224
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:03,670
I will talk with him.

225
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:06,710
You are the magistrate.

226
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:08,670
You are the father figure of Linfen.

227
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,320
Public matters are of utmost importance.

228
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,400
"He who possesses true courage
in the world

229
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:18,030
will confront sudden occurrences..."

230
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:20,150
"The so-called heroes of ancient times

231
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:22,000
must have had extraordinary integrity.

232
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:25,280
There are things
that ordinary people cannot bear.

233
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:28,440
A common man,
when insulted, will draw his sword

234
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,520
and fight..."

235
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:32,960
"...and have far-reaching aspirations."

236
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:44,260
[Linfen Yamen]

237
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:56,760
Greetings, Mr. Liu.

238
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:06,910
Greetings,

239
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:08,550
Mr. Liu.

240
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:11,230
No need for formalities.

241
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:18,000
Mr. Liu, you've traveled a long way.
Please.

242
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:40,110
Wan is here

243
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,640
to visit someone.

244
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,590
She has a close cousin

245
00:13:51,710 --> 00:13:52,910
who married into Linfen.

246
00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:55,910
Since Wan is here,

247
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,880
let's discuss

248
00:13:58,880 --> 00:13:59,840
setting a wedding date

249
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:00,710
for you two.

250
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:03,150
Mr. Liu,

251
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:04,670
let's come in and talk.

252
00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:05,880
The refreshments are ready.

253
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:12,880
Please.

254
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:36,320
Is Luo Shu alright?

255
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:38,000
How could she be alright?

256
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:40,230
At this point, it's all fate.

257
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:50,910
Muzhi,

258
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:53,350
you haven't been in office long,

259
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:54,760
but you've done well.

260
00:14:55,470 --> 00:14:56,200
You've eliminated

261
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,710
the threats
that plagued Linfen for many years.

262
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,200
More importantly,

263
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:03,320
you've collected evidence
against the eunuch faction.

264
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:04,350
That's good.

265
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:06,000
Very good.

266
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:08,520
These are my duties.

267
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,590
However, there are some matters

268
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:13,910
that you should not meddle in.

269
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:16,670
Like those long-settled

270
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:17,590
old cases.

271
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:19,230
Why do you have to dig them up?

272
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:22,230
It won't help you with your promotion.

273
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:23,550
And it might make others think

274
00:15:23,550 --> 00:15:24,440
you only

275
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:25,880
get entangled

276
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:27,030
in trivial matters,

277
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:29,880
lacking vision and perspective.

278
00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:40,080
I heard

279
00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:42,320
that Mr. Qi

280
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,350
from Pingyangwei

281
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:44,760
also participated in this case.

282
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,910
What is his character like?

283
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:51,280
I've had some dealings with Mr. Qi

284
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:53,030
due to work,

285
00:15:53,590 --> 00:15:55,200
but I don't know him very well.

286
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:00,880
But I heard

287
00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:03,320
that you two are quite close.

288
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:11,960
If they truly are close,

289
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,030
that might be a good thing.

290
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:21,710
What do you mean by that, Wan?

291
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:23,590
Father,

292
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,760
my cousin and I

293
00:16:25,910 --> 00:16:26,670
were very close

294
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:28,000
before she married.

295
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,910
She told me everything.

296
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:31,280
At that time,

297
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:33,840
I even knew

298
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:35,320
what her mother and father argued about.

299
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,710
After all, we are family.

300
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:39,150
So close-knit.

301
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:40,790
Naturally, I knew more

302
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,400
than outsiders.

303
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:50,200
Alright.

304
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:53,000
You can get close to Mr. Qi.

305
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:55,230
It's fine.

306
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:58,440
Yes.

307
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,110
It's just that his father

308
00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:03,000
is quite difficult to deal with.

309
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:06,470
Mr. Qi is quite unruly.

310
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:08,310
I've heard about that for a long time.

311
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:09,830
As the saying goes,

312
00:17:09,830 --> 00:17:12,350
A solid dyke can collapse
because of an ant hole in it.

313
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Who knows, years down the line,

314
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:18,190
he might become that ant hole.

315
00:17:19,070 --> 00:17:19,950
Muzhi,

316
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:21,800
being an official,

317
00:17:22,230 --> 00:17:24,710
ability is just one aspect.

318
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:27,400
More importantly, it's about perception.

319
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:30,280
If you align with the wrong person,

320
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:32,680
it's either a dead end for promotion

321
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:35,070
or you might lose your head.

322
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,430
Every year, there are exams;

323
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:39,950
every year, someone tops the list,

324
00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:42,110
but the actual posts are so few.

325
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:43,710
If you can't seize the opportunity,

326
00:17:43,710 --> 00:17:45,830
it will belong to someone else.

327
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:50,880
You are not an outsider.

328
00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:52,070
I speak these words

329
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,590
in all honesty for you.

330
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:02,430
Thank you for your guidance, Mr. Liu.

331
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:09,590
"...must have had
extraordinary integrity.

332
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,950
There are things
that ordinary people cannot bear.

333
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,880
A common man,
when insulted, will draw his sword

334
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:17,950
and fight..."

335
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:19,160
Young Master.

336
00:18:20,590 --> 00:18:21,310
Mr. Qi.

337
00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:27,190
Mr. Qi,

338
00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:29,000
what are you doing?

339
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:31,830
This is called "Hanging from the Beam,
Thorns in the Thigh."

340
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,880
My young master is determined to strive.

341
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:36,680
I know, this scene is in the play.

342
00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:37,640
Impressive.

343
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:39,040
How is everyone, Captain Cai?

344
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:40,160
You came specifically to find me?

345
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:41,160
Not really.

346
00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:44,160
Sort of.

347
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,680
Some official business has been settled.

348
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:47,560
Haven't you

349
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:49,040
been away from the yamen for a while?

350
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:50,880
Before I came, Baozi made some buns

351
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:51,830
for you.

352
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:53,520
She said you love the buns

353
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:54,680
that she makes for you.

354
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:56,760
Thank you!

355
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:57,230
Come on.

356
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:03,680
How is it?

357
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:06,230
Indeed, the buns that Baozi makes

358
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:07,040
are so delicious.

359
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:10,160
Thanks!

360
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:11,190
Lian Shu, hurry!

361
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:11,950
Bring the osmanthus cakes

362
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:13,160
my mother sent from Taiyuan.

363
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,160
Get a box, quickly!

364
00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:14,950
No, thanks.

365
00:19:14,950 --> 00:19:15,680
Two boxes!

366
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:16,190
Give them all to him!

367
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:16,800
That's too many.

368
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:17,470
I can't take them.

369
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:18,430
They're not for you.

370
00:19:18,430 --> 00:19:19,310
They're for Baozi.

371
00:19:19,310 --> 00:19:20,160
If Baozi

372
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:20,560
can't finish them,

373
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:21,430
share them with Luo...

374
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:23,880
no, with others.

375
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:26,230
Alright.

376
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:27,680
Thank you, Mr. Qi!

377
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:28,640
No problem.

378
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:34,070
Why don't you
come back to the yamen with me?

379
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,920
If I go back,
I'll just be looked down upon.

380
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:43,560
That...

381
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:44,430
I won't feel comfortable.

382
00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:45,310
So I won't go back.

383
00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:49,470
You need to go back to help Luo Shu.

384
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:55,950
What happened to Luo Shu?

385
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:58,680
Mr. Liu

386
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,190
brought his daughter here.

387
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:01,310
I heard

388
00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:03,520
they seem to be discussing
the wedding date.

389
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:05,680
You know, Luo Shu and the magistrate...

390
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:10,110
Anyway,

391
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:11,920
Luo Shu is feeling
very troubled right now.

392
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,310
You usually work with her on cases.

393
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:15,280
You can talk to her.

394
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,310
Come back with me.

395
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:19,400
You can comfort her.

396
00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:28,000
What's wrong, Mr. Qi?

397
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:31,800
I still won't go.

398
00:20:32,950 --> 00:20:33,760
Why not?

399
00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:40,560
To avoid people saying
I'm taking advantage of her misfortune.

400
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:48,950
Luo Shu.

401
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:53,680
Mr. Chen.

402
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:58,230
You're feeling uneasy, right?

403
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:01,830
What was meant to happen

404
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:03,350
will always happen.

405
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:05,040
Right now,

406
00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:07,470
he's stuck between two fires.

407
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,070
One side is you,

408
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,000
and the other is Mr. Liu.

409
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:13,430
This hurdle is tough to overcome.

410
00:21:15,310 --> 00:21:16,160
I know.

411
00:21:16,950 --> 00:21:18,190
Matters of the heart

412
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:19,710
depend on one's own feelings.

413
00:21:19,710 --> 00:21:21,160
Others can't decide.

414
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:24,520
Thank you for your comfort.

415
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:27,230
There haven't been
many cases these days.

416
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:29,280
You should go out more.

417
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,110
Clear your mind.

418
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,920
Consider it a break for yourself.

419
00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:34,000
Alright.

420
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:36,950
You've been on the road today,

421
00:21:36,950 --> 00:21:38,070
bumping around for quite a while.

422
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,160
You must be tired.

423
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:40,800
It's better to rest early today.

424
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,470
I will discuss things
in detail with you tomorrow.

425
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:43,710
Sounds good.

426
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:46,680
I'll see you off.

427
00:21:47,310 --> 00:21:48,160
No need.

428
00:21:49,230 --> 00:21:50,230
Wan is here.

429
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:51,590
You two can talk.

430
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:53,830
My daughter

431
00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:55,710
has always had her own ideas.

432
00:21:56,070 --> 00:21:57,520
Since you're both together,

433
00:21:58,070 --> 00:21:59,160
you might as well discuss

434
00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:01,680
the wedding date.

435
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:10,560
Muzhi,

436
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:13,430
my father has high hopes for you.

437
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:15,110
He hopes you can achieve great things,

438
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:17,430
so he's been a bit strict.

439
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:19,280
Please don't take it to heart.

440
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:22,000
Mr. Liu means well.

441
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:23,430
I understand.

442
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,280
You don't have to call him "Mr. Liu."

443
00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:27,160
After all,

444
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,430
we've been engaged.

445
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:35,400
When do you think

446
00:22:35,950 --> 00:22:38,000
is a good time for the wedding?

447
00:22:39,470 --> 00:22:41,310
My father thinks spring is suitable,

448
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:42,280
but I feel

449
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:44,110
it might be a bit rushed.

450
00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:45,640
Muzhi,

451
00:22:46,070 --> 00:22:46,920
what do you think?

452
00:22:49,430 --> 00:22:50,470
I have no opinion.

453
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:55,470
You can go back to your official duties.

454
00:22:56,430 --> 00:22:58,800
I can take care of these matters.

455
00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:01,520
Thank you.

456
00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:06,160
By the way, Muzhi,

457
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:11,110
I've heard you specifically requested

458
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,830
to have a Luo girl
removed from the registry.

459
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,160
Is that true?

460
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:20,880
Previously, to solve a major case,

461
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,400
I had this girl act as an informant.

462
00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:24,880
She took great risks
and made significant contributions.

463
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:26,280
The yamen should reward her.

464
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:28,950
Since she wanted
to be removed from the register,

465
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:30,520
I decided to support her request.

466
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
I see.

467
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:36,470
I have official business to attend to.

468
00:23:36,710 --> 00:23:37,680
I'll take my leave.

469
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:50,230
You should inquire

470
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:51,590
if there's a constable named Luo

471
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:54,000
in the yamen.

472
00:23:55,230 --> 00:23:56,040
Miss Liu,

473
00:23:56,230 --> 00:23:57,920
isn't that Luo a woman?

474
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:59,110
Why are you looking for a constable?

475
00:24:00,310 --> 00:24:02,070
I've seen all the official documents

476
00:24:02,430 --> 00:24:03,800
he submitted to my father.

477
00:24:04,830 --> 00:24:05,880
The constable named Luo

478
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:07,680
has been mentioned more than once

479
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,230
in the case files.

480
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:12,950
Both of them share the surname Luo.

481
00:24:13,430 --> 00:24:14,560
What a coincidence!

482
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:16,640
But Luo is not a common surname.

483
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:19,830
I suspect these two

484
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:22,310
might have a family connection.

485
00:24:24,110 --> 00:24:25,560
Find out the background of Constable Luo

486
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:26,830
for me.

487
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:27,520
Yes.

488
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:29,070
Do you know who to ask?

489
00:24:29,190 --> 00:24:29,830
Yes, I do.

490
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,590
Be careful in your actions.

491
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:33,680
Don't let others notice.

492
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:35,230
Especially Muzhi.

493
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:35,950
Understood.

494
00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:02,310
Why are you here?

495
00:25:03,190 --> 00:25:04,590
I didn't know she would come too.

496
00:25:05,590 --> 00:25:06,400
Don't be afraid.

497
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:08,400
I'll explain everything to her.

498
00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:10,470
I have nothing to lose.

499
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:11,800
So I'm not afraid.

500
00:25:13,070 --> 00:25:14,190
I'm just worried about you.

501
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,070
Don't worry about me.

502
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:18,640
I've drafted the annulment letter.

503
00:25:19,070 --> 00:25:20,160
In the coming days, I'll find a chance

504
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:21,070
to resolve this matter.

505
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,310
No rush.

506
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:23,710
Please don't

507
00:25:23,710 --> 00:25:24,950
act on impulse.

508
00:25:25,110 --> 00:25:26,070
At this critical moment,

509
00:25:26,070 --> 00:25:27,710
don't hastily go to Mr. Liu
to break off the engagement.

510
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:28,920
I know what I'm doing.

511
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:33,000
I'm just sorry for you.

512
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:36,400
If she gives you a hard time,

513
00:25:37,190 --> 00:25:38,310
just come to me.

514
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:39,640
You don't have to face it alone.

515
00:25:41,230 --> 00:25:41,830
I know.

516
00:25:56,590 --> 00:25:58,000
Miss Liu, I found out.

517
00:25:58,230 --> 00:25:59,520
There is indeed a Chief Luo.

518
00:26:08,350 --> 00:26:09,430
Miss...

519
00:26:09,430 --> 00:26:10,190
You're

520
00:26:10,190 --> 00:26:11,710
the cook in the yamen, right?

521
00:26:12,350 --> 00:26:13,310
My lady

522
00:26:13,310 --> 00:26:15,040
wants to borrow your kitchen.

523
00:26:15,350 --> 00:26:16,760
Miss Liu,

524
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,350
haven't you had breakfast yet?

525
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,710
Breakfast will be ready soon.

526
00:26:20,470 --> 00:26:21,800
Yesterday's journey was tiring,

527
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:23,190
so I want to make some sweet soup

528
00:26:23,190 --> 00:26:24,640
to refresh my father.

529
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:26,950
I also want to invite Magistrate Han

530
00:26:26,950 --> 00:26:27,950
to taste it together.

531
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:30,430
I wonder if I can borrow the kitchen.

532
00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:31,920
Feel free to use it.

533
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:36,190
Shouldn't this side courtyard
be for the matchmakers

534
00:26:36,190 --> 00:26:37,830
and the female cooks?

535
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:40,070
How could a man be allowed in?

536
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,950
This must be Chief Luo, right?

537
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:47,590
Even if he's a constable

538
00:26:47,590 --> 00:26:48,640
it's not quite proper.

539
00:26:48,950 --> 00:26:50,110
It's improper behavior.

540
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:54,160
Chief Luo is actually a woman,

541
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:55,710
so it's perfectly fine.

542
00:27:17,470 --> 00:27:19,040
The person you asked me to inquire about

543
00:27:19,230 --> 00:27:20,920
is well known.

544
00:27:21,190 --> 00:27:23,000
Everyone in the yamen knows her.

545
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:24,110
Really?

546
00:27:24,590 --> 00:27:26,950
Luo Shu's real name is Luo Shuxiang.

547
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:29,800
She used to be a performer
from Mingke House.

548
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:31,920
Her stage name was "Jin Nang."

549
00:27:33,070 --> 00:27:35,110
She helped the yamen with a case,

550
00:27:35,430 --> 00:27:37,560
and the yamen made an exception
to remove her from the register.

551
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:40,560
But somehow,

552
00:27:40,590 --> 00:27:41,830
she got a job

553
00:27:42,110 --> 00:27:43,520
at the yamen,

554
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:44,680
becoming Chief Luo.

555
00:27:54,190 --> 00:27:56,760
My lady wants to see you

556
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:58,190
in the inner courtyard.

557
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:02,300
[Linfen]

558
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:04,100
[Linfen Yamen]

559
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:06,430
What should I call you?

560
00:28:07,110 --> 00:28:09,110
Should I call you Chief Luo

561
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:10,950
or Miss Luo?

562
00:28:12,350 --> 00:28:13,520
Just call me Luo Shu.

563
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:14,680
That's what everyone calls me.

564
00:28:28,350 --> 00:28:29,160
Oh no.

565
00:28:56,190 --> 00:28:57,070
Chief Luo.

566
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,310
Please sit down.

567
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:11,760
Normally,

568
00:29:12,430 --> 00:29:14,040
the yamen has many affairs to attend to.

569
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:16,230
I'm worried that my sudden invitation

570
00:29:16,470 --> 00:29:18,040
might delay your important work.

571
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:20,310
I just find myself

572
00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:21,880
feeling quite bored and restless
in the inner courtyard,

573
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:23,350
and can't find other women to talk to.

574
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:24,920
I've heard

575
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:27,920
that you are skilled in music,
chess, calligraphy, and painting,

576
00:29:28,430 --> 00:29:30,400
so I wanted to invite you for a chat

577
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:31,560
to relieve my boredom.

578
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:33,560
Miss Liu, you're too kind.

579
00:29:34,110 --> 00:29:35,400
Our statuses are different,

580
00:29:35,950 --> 00:29:36,950
so technically,

581
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:38,590
I shouldn't be in the inner courtyard,

582
00:29:38,950 --> 00:29:40,400
and I definitely shouldn't
be sitting with you.

583
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:43,040
Miss Luo,

584
00:29:43,710 --> 00:29:45,160
why are you being so formal?

585
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:46,950
We are both women,

586
00:29:47,590 --> 00:29:49,230
so there's no need
to be overly concerned

587
00:29:49,230 --> 00:29:50,520
about status.

588
00:29:58,280 --> 00:29:59,070
Over here.

589
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:03,800
Muzhi.

590
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:05,110
What's wrong?

591
00:30:09,190 --> 00:30:11,000
Luo Shu went with Miss Liu's maid

592
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,070
to the inner courtyard.

593
00:30:13,470 --> 00:30:14,280
When was that?

594
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:15,280
Just now.

595
00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:21,280
If it's a curse,

596
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:23,920
it cannot be avoided.

597
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:25,800
You don't need to be so nervous.

598
00:30:26,470 --> 00:30:27,710
Today, I called you over

599
00:30:27,830 --> 00:30:29,470
to give you a gift.

600
00:30:47,830 --> 00:30:49,680
My lady presents you with a sachet.

601
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:51,680
Express your gratitude and accept it.

602
00:30:52,070 --> 00:30:52,880
That is something

603
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:54,920
I specially prepared for you.

604
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:57,000
I wonder if you'll like it.

605
00:31:08,310 --> 00:31:09,230
Muzhi has arrived.

606
00:31:13,190 --> 00:31:15,110
You're really something, Jin Nang.

607
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:16,920
No sooner had I invited you here

608
00:31:17,310 --> 00:31:18,880
than Magistrate Han arrived.

609
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:21,310
Jin Nang,

610
00:31:21,950 --> 00:31:23,760
it shows how popular you were

611
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,400
at Mingke House.

612
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,160
Thank you, Miss Liu.

613
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:30,830
I really like it.

614
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:47,760
I still have a case
to discuss with Constable Luo,

615
00:31:48,830 --> 00:31:49,760
so I'll take my leave now.

616
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:52,800
Mr. Han!

617
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:55,190
What's wrong with him?

618
00:31:55,190 --> 00:31:56,800
All for someone from a music house.

619
00:32:08,350 --> 00:32:09,760
Haven't I told you before?

620
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:11,680
When such things happen,

621
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:12,350
come to me first.

622
00:32:12,350 --> 00:32:13,760
Don't face it alone.

623
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:15,830
Miss Liu hasn't

624
00:32:15,830 --> 00:32:16,800
treated me badly.

625
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:17,640
You're still putting on a brave face.

626
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:24,110
I will definitely protect you.

627
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:25,520
Trust me.

628
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:29,640
Of course I trust you.

629
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:32,640
I believe in your sincerity towards me.

630
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:34,400
With such sincerity,

631
00:32:35,070 --> 00:32:36,470
even if it's just for a moment,

632
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,190
I would be content.

633
00:32:40,350 --> 00:32:41,520
But perhaps

634
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:44,560
we shouldn't go against the current.

635
00:32:46,350 --> 00:32:47,950
You've endured ten years of hard study,

636
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,230
and finally achieved

637
00:32:49,230 --> 00:32:50,430
today's situation.

638
00:32:50,950 --> 00:32:51,950
You can finally realize

639
00:32:51,950 --> 00:32:53,470
your ideals and ambitions.

640
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:55,520
If you were to ruin your future
because of me...

641
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:56,400
What future is that?

642
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:59,680
Is it a future
gained by being a son-in-law?

643
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:03,280
I often find myself ridiculous,

644
00:33:03,830 --> 00:33:05,680
despising the identity
of a son-in-law under the exam scroll,

645
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:07,590
yet shamelessly enjoying

646
00:33:07,590 --> 00:33:09,280
the conveniences that come with it.

647
00:33:10,470 --> 00:33:12,000
I have great ambitions,

648
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:14,110
wanting to serve the country,

649
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:15,590
to do something for the court

650
00:33:15,590 --> 00:33:16,560
and the people.

651
00:33:17,110 --> 00:33:17,920
But every time I think

652
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:19,230
about how even if I hold
a high position in the future,

653
00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:19,880
it won't be due to

654
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:21,310
my talent and abilities,

655
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:23,350
I feel

656
00:33:23,350 --> 00:33:24,880
that everything is meaningless.

657
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:27,160
For the sake of my future,

658
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:29,710
I have given up too much.

659
00:33:32,830 --> 00:33:33,920
Now,
the only thing that allows me to feel

660
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:35,920
that refreshing current inside is you.

661
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:39,190
If I were to lose you again,

662
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:42,400
I couldn't even imagine.

663
00:33:44,190 --> 00:33:45,400
Perhaps by that time,

664
00:33:46,070 --> 00:33:47,830
there will be no more
Han Muzhi in this world,

665
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:50,950
only a son-in-law under the exam scroll.

666
00:33:53,070 --> 00:33:53,880
Muzhi.

667
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:57,830
Luo Shu.

668
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:01,470
Actually,
both Liu Wan and I are the same.

669
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:02,760
We're not in control of our own lives.

670
00:34:03,350 --> 00:34:04,280
A word from Mr. Liu

671
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:05,680
determined our futures.

672
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:09,600
I want to talk things over with her.

673
00:34:09,950 --> 00:34:11,230
She will definitely
call off the engagement.

674
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:12,870
But I feel

675
00:34:13,710 --> 00:34:15,390
that Miss Liu does care for you.

676
00:34:16,470 --> 00:34:17,520
What she cares about is

677
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:19,000
following her father's wishes,

678
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,800
not about me as a person.

679
00:34:24,430 --> 00:34:25,230
Wait for me.

680
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,470
You must have seen

681
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:42,230
that I have feelings for Luo Shu.

682
00:34:50,190 --> 00:34:52,710
The laws state clearly:

683
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:56,840
Any official who marries a performer
as a wife or concubine

684
00:34:57,430 --> 00:34:58,230
will be punished with sixty strokes

685
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:00,150
and divorced.

686
00:35:00,390 --> 00:35:01,910
I have submitted a request
to remove her from the register.

687
00:35:05,710 --> 00:35:07,080
Even if she is removed
from the register,

688
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:09,230
her background

689
00:35:09,430 --> 00:35:10,840
cannot be changed.

690
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:13,150
If you take her as a concubine,

691
00:35:13,630 --> 00:35:15,320
aren't you afraid
of being ridiculed by your peers?

692
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:18,390
Aren't you afraid
of ruining your bright future?

693
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,320
Miss Liu,

694
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:27,320
I don't intend
to take her as a concubine.

695
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:30,520
This engagement

696
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:32,600
is not voluntary for either of us.

697
00:35:33,630 --> 00:35:34,760
Have you ever thought about it?

698
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:36,360
Maybe we were meant to have

699
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:37,430
different lives.

700
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:39,800
With your background,

701
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:41,120
appearance, and talents,

702
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:42,520
even marrying the son of a minister

703
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:43,630
or a noble

704
00:35:43,870 --> 00:35:44,910
would be fine.

705
00:35:46,430 --> 00:35:47,320
I came today

706
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:48,280
to discuss with you...

707
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:49,080
Enough.

708
00:35:51,230 --> 00:35:51,910
I thought

709
00:35:51,910 --> 00:35:53,280
it wouldn't come to this.

710
00:35:55,190 --> 00:35:56,000
He Xiang,

711
00:35:57,870 --> 00:35:59,040
bring that thing over.

712
00:35:59,040 --> 00:35:59,840
Yes.

713
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:22,120
Wait, Magistrate Han.

714
00:36:24,150 --> 00:36:25,430
Mr. Liu wants to see you.

715
00:36:49,950 --> 00:36:50,870
Miss Luo,

716
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:52,760
how do you like
the new dishes I learned to make?

717
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:53,560
Are they delicious?

718
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,040
Then eat more.

719
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:02,150
Luo Shu.

720
00:37:04,910 --> 00:37:05,910
Come here.

721
00:37:19,950 --> 00:37:21,280
Tomorrow, my lady

722
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,670
will hold a gathering
in the inner courtyard.

723
00:37:22,910 --> 00:37:24,600
You must attend on time.

724
00:37:32,230 --> 00:37:33,870
Should we inform the magistrate?

725
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:37,190
I don't think it's necessary.

726
00:37:37,190 --> 00:37:37,950
Miss Liu

727
00:37:37,950 --> 00:37:38,950
inviting Miss Luo

728
00:37:38,950 --> 00:37:40,080
to the gathering

729
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:41,870
might mean
she's willing to accept Miss Luo.

730
00:37:42,470 --> 00:37:43,150
They'll both

731
00:37:43,150 --> 00:37:44,190
marry the magistrate?

732
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:04,430
The Emperor values water management.

733
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:05,870
Make sure

734
00:38:05,870 --> 00:38:07,670
you keep this in mind.

735
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:09,950
You cannot allow any mistakes

736
00:38:10,430 --> 00:38:11,950
during your term.

737
00:38:12,630 --> 00:38:13,430
I know.

738
00:38:14,710 --> 00:38:16,080
What's your plan for tomorrow?

739
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:17,430
Tomorrow morning,

740
00:38:17,430 --> 00:38:19,320
I'll go with you to inspect the dam.

741
00:38:19,470 --> 00:38:20,280
Alright.

742
00:38:26,060 --> 00:38:27,940
[Invitation]

743
00:38:35,190 --> 00:38:36,000
She's here.

744
00:38:42,470 --> 00:38:43,280
Welcome.

745
00:38:45,230 --> 00:38:46,560
Allow me to introduce.

746
00:38:46,670 --> 00:38:48,230
This is Jin Nang.

747
00:38:48,390 --> 00:38:49,800
She is quite a celebrity in Linfen.

748
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:52,910
She was once
the top performer at Mingke House.

749
00:38:56,390 --> 00:38:58,280
I've heard

750
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:00,320
that she's quite skilled in music

751
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:02,470
and envied by all for her beauty.

752
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:04,710
Today, we are fortunate to have her

753
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:05,800
to entertain us.

754
00:39:15,470 --> 00:39:17,760
Jin Nang, please.

755
00:39:25,670 --> 00:39:26,470
Please.

756
00:40:37,710 --> 00:40:40,120
Wuniang,
I don't want to go to the music house.

757
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:44,320
Get up and go.

758
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:45,390
Let's go.

759
00:40:47,670 --> 00:40:48,470
Madam,

760
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:50,630
please let me stay, Madam.

761
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:10,800
Ruyi.

762
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,190
Ruyi, help me.

763
00:41:13,470 --> 00:41:15,190
I don't want to go, Ruyi.

764
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:36,280
I wonder what rare dishes

765
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:37,910
will be at this gathering.

766
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:54,150
It's rare to have Jin Nang here.

767
00:41:54,430 --> 00:41:56,080
We must enjoy ourselves.

768
00:41:56,670 --> 00:41:57,950
If you have any requests,

769
00:41:57,950 --> 00:41:58,950
just tell her.

770
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:00,840
Then let's have another one.

771
00:42:00,910 --> 00:42:02,190
"The Moon
over the River on a Spring Night."

772
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:04,120
"The Moon on High."

773
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:05,670
And also "On the Frontier."

774
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,040
