[Episode 11]

4
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:34,360
Drink mine. Trust me.

5
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:34,720
I'm fine.

6
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:35,310
Drink mine.

7
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:35,950
Trust me.

8
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:47,080
It spilled.

9
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:48,630
It's fine.

10
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:50,550
You can drink mine now.

11
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:52,830
It contains red dates and goji berries,

12
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:53,510
and other ingredients.

13
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,510
Drink it to warm up.

14
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:56,800
Then have some chicken soup

15
00:01:57,510 --> 00:01:58,400
to nourish your body.

16
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:02,120
Please sit.

17
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,480
Be careful.

18
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,270
Thanks.

19
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:18,670
Have a try.

20
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,440
Is your name Luo Shu

21
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,720
or Luo Shuxiang?

22
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:36,830
What do you mean?

23
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,440
Jin Nang.

24
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:40,800
I didn't expect you

25
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,080
to be Jin Nang from Mingke House.

26
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,470
We have quite a connection, don't we?

27
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,000
I thought you were so far away,

28
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:47,520
but you are right in front of me.

29
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:49,600
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

30
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:50,440
You even deliberately let me

31
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,440
introduce you to Jin Nang.

32
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,880
You just wanted to embarrass me, right?

33
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,190
I went to Mingke House

34
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:55,470
in the morning to invite Jin Nang,

35
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:57,550
sorry, Miss Luo.

36
00:02:58,830 --> 00:02:59,670
But when I got there,

37
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:00,030
they said

38
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:01,360
Miss Luo had redeemed herself.

39
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:03,670
I thought, since I was there,

40
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:04,800
I didn't want to

41
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,750
let you down,

42
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:07,360
so I invited

43
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,880
the Five Beauties of Mingke.

44
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,800
They were all on the boat just now.

45
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:13,670
Why didn't you say hi to them?

46
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:15,800
Right,

47
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,440
you were scared just now.

48
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:18,550
By the way,

49
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:20,360
you recognized me

50
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:21,880
in the jail that day,

51
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:22,390
didn't you?

52
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:24,470
I did.

53
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:25,750
Then why didn't you say it?

54
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,750
Why would I do that?

55
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:29,630
Mr. Qi, thanks for reminding me

56
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:31,630
of my origin in the Music House

57
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,470
and that I am lowborn.

58
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:34,190
No.

59
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:34,550
Why do you think

60
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:35,910
I changed my name,

61
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,880
and disguised myself as a man?

62
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:38,630
Why do you think

63
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:40,240
I became a constable?

64
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:42,080
It's because I don't want to
have connection

65
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,390
with my past anymore.

66
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:45,600
Yet you keep reminding me,

67
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,320
forcing me to admit

68
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:47,750
that I am from the Music House.

69
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,000
I didn't mean to degrade you.

70
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,670
I just think it's amazing
that we have this connection.

71
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:53,270
Mr. Qi, you're so precious.

72
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,240
How could we have a connection?

73
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,160
Just get out of here.

74
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,440
Someone as lowly as me

75
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:01,470
will taint your reputation.

76
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:03,270
I...

77
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:05,470
I didn't say anything

78
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:06,750
and you just get mad out of the blue.

79
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:08,630
What did I say to insult you?

80
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:10,470
You just tell me.

81
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:11,830
I really don't understand

82
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,030
why you get angry.

83
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,910
With your noble status,

84
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:16,440
you will never understand

85
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,670
the thoughts of us lowly folk.

86
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:19,640
If I really thought you that way,

87
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:20,440
I wouldn't have spent

88
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,550
five hundred and one liang for you.

89
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:25,160
You are wealthy,

90
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,160
of course

91
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,160
you don't care about

92
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:27,880
five hundred and one liang.

93
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,320
That's not what I meant.

94
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:31,230
I was a performer in the Music House.

95
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,480
I had no choice.

96
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,720
I once ended up in Mingke House.

97
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:39,670
God was unfair.

98
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:41,230
God was being unfair to you.

99
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:42,110
I was not.

100
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:43,040
Don't get angry with me.

101
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,160
I sympathize with you.

102
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,670
I don't need that.

103
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:48,720
Mind your own business.

104
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:50,480
You're just gold without
and rubbish within.

105
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,720
A worthless good-for-nothing.

106
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:52,550
I...

107
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:54,440
You call me good-for-nothing?

108
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:57,040
Although you have a noble status,

109
00:04:57,110 --> 00:04:58,510
you use your father's name,

110
00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:00,230
showing off in public and
spending lavishly.

111
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,830
You have no ambition, no knowledge,

112
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:02,880
yet always feel self-satisfied.

113
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:04,110
People like you

114
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:05,200
are so pathetic.

115
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,110
White Fan.

116
00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:35,760
The woman we kidnapped additionally

117
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:36,670
has been rescued,

118
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:38,550
but Qiao Ruolan has not been found yet.

119
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:40,720
Are you sure?

120
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,230
Yes.

121
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:42,270
I hid nearby for a long time

122
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:43,320
to observe.

123
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,950
What about Bai Er?

124
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,920
You don't need to worry about them.

125
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,480
Leave the city and hide.

126
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:57,670
Got it.

[The secret recipe of Jinrui Liquor]

128
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,350
Qiao Ruolan should have drowned already.

129
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:10,000
Great, great.

130
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:16,230
Now that she's dead,

131
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,320
no one will cause me trouble anymore.

132
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:21,830
With this secret recipe,

133
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:23,440
the liquor distillery

134
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,670
will truly be my cash cow.

135
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:31,000
By then...

136
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:33,790
What, yours?

137
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:35,230
This secret recipe.

138
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:36,390
I had to sacrifice two of my men

139
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:36,880
to get it.

140
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:39,830
It's time to start the brewing process.

141
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,200
Take over the business

142
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,830
completely

143
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:45,720
to avoid complications.

144
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:46,640
Okay.

145
00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:50,790
Will they

146
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:51,920
snitch on you?

147
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:55,350
They don't know anything.

148
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:56,550
Okay.

149
00:06:57,550 --> 00:06:58,880
Good.

150
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:15,350
Say it or not?

151
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:16,920
Say it or not?

152
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:18,790
Say it!

153
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,760
Your Honor, please.

154
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:23,000
I'll confess!

155
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:24,480
Say it.

156
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:26,040
We are indeed

157
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:27,670
from the White Ant.

158
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,320
Normally,

159
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,350
we are decent boatmen.

160
00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:34,040
When we receive an order,

161
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:35,350
we follow through on it.

162
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:36,790
Have you been involved in
murder, robbery,

163
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,760
and trafficking in women?

164
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,160
We haven't killed anyone.

165
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,000
Just kidnapped women.

166
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:47,390
Kidnapped women?

167
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:49,040
Hit!

168
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:57,510
Please.

169
00:07:57,790 --> 00:07:59,600
Please stop, Your Honor.

170
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:02,600
Tell me, who sent you to do this?

171
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:03,760
White Fan.

172
00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:04,920
Who's White Fan?

173
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,720
White Fan is White Fan.

174
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:07,950
Hit!

175
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,270
White Fan

176
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:11,070
is second in charge in the White Ant.

177
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:13,920
We don't usually see him.

178
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,440
All we know is his name,

179
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:18,510
nothing else.

180
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:20,790
Alright.

181
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,390
Who put his hands

182
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:31,550
on our female constable today?

183
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:33,590
Say it!

184
00:08:34,910 --> 00:08:36,470
It was him!

185
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:37,910
I didn't do anything!

186
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:38,710
I...

187
00:08:40,350 --> 00:08:40,840
No.

188
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:44,280
It wasn't me.

189
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,400
Take him back to the jail.

190
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,350
He stays.

191
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:54,000
Continue.

192
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,150
Your Honor, please spare me.

193
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,790
I wasn't me, Your Honor.

194
00:08:58,110 --> 00:08:59,110
Please, Your Honor.

195
00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:00,320
I don't know anything!

196
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:00,910
Your Honor.

197
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:05,910
Muzhi.

198
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,110
You're the magistrate.

199
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:08,350
How can you interrogate criminals,

200
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:09,880
especially in the jail?

201
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:11,790
What's the background of the White Ant?

202
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,080
Nothing special.

203
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,550
Just a bunch of gangsters,

204
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:18,030
specializing in kidnapping women.

205
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:21,150
They make a living like ordinary people
in normal days.

206
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,200
It's difficult to distinguish them,

207
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:25,230
not to mention suppressing them.

208
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:26,670
Actually,

209
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:29,080
they've been terrorizing in Linfen

210
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,520
for over a decade.

211
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:31,960
Over a decade?

212
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:33,880
And no one has brought them to justice?

213
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,320
About six years ago,

214
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,440
a provincial governor
wanted to clean them up.

215
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,910
He came to Linfen to supervise.

216
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,590
Dozens of White Ants

217
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:42,030
were waiting in ambush
on a bustling street.

218
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:43,760
When his carriage passed by,

219
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,030
they swarmed out.

220
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:46,470
Before the officials could react,

221
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:48,590
the provincial governor was pulled off

222
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,960
and got a series of slaps in the face.

223
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:52,880
His face swelled up like a pig's head.

224
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:55,320
Then they scattered in an instant.

225
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:56,910
The provincial governor

226
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:58,440
not only lost his hearing,

227
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,080
but also couldn't continue his duty.

228
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,590
He had to retire

229
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:04,520
and became a complete laughingstock.

230
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:08,030
I've heard about that.

231
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:09,280
So,

232
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:10,550
don't think about

233
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:11,640
capturing them anymore.

234
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:17,520
That's ridiculous.

235
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:20,910
She pushed me too far.

236
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:22,880
Why did she scold me?

237
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,910
You insulted her first.

238
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:26,840
What?

239
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,200
I said you were right.

240
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:30,520
She wronged me.

241
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:32,590
When did I ever treat people differently
because of their status?

242
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:33,150
Over time,

243
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:34,440
she'll know how great you are.

244
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,280
Of course.

245
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:37,840
Scold me, huh?

246
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,200
Alright,

247
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:40,910
you better do not regret.

248
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:44,280
Yeah.

249
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,790
I'll leave.

250
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:48,400
Let's see what she'll do without me.

251
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:49,960
Lian Shu,

252
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:51,670
go to tell everyone in the county yamen,

253
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:53,150
especially the one surnamed Luo,

254
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:54,880
that I'm gonna leave Linfen

255
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:55,960
and will never come back.

256
00:10:57,230 --> 00:10:58,470
Young Master, are you serious?

257
00:10:58,960 --> 00:10:59,880
Just go.

258
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:08,660
[Linfen Yamen]

259
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:13,960
Young Master.

260
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:15,280
How's it?

261
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:16,670
What's her reaction?

262
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:17,960
She said, "Oh."

263
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:18,960
Oh?

264
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:19,640
Oh.

265
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:20,760
Oh?

266
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,030
That's it? Then what?

267
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:23,840
Then I came back.

268
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:29,960
She pushed me too far.

269
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:33,760
Great. You want to stay cool, huh?

270
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:34,790
I can also be cool.

271
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:37,400
Lian Shu, go to pack up.

272
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:38,840
Yes, Young Master.

273
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:40,760
Lian Shu,

274
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:43,150
make sure you've packed up everything.

275
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,640
My hairpin,

276
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:46,710
put it away.

277
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:48,080
And those Liulin Red Dates,

278
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:48,910
pack them up too.

279
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,840
I'll give to the girls at home

280
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,000
and let them have a good taste.

281
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:54,280
And the horse,

282
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:56,790
make sure it's well-fed.

283
00:11:57,230 --> 00:11:59,000
We'll have a long ride

284
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,150
back to Taiyuan tomorrow.

285
00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:03,470
Young Master,

286
00:12:03,710 --> 00:12:05,440
I don't think they can hear you.

287
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:08,910
Just pack up.

288
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:14,960
I'm getting hypoxic.

289
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:17,710
I will leave.

290
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:19,200
Our men

291
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,760
are still searching
along the river bank.

292
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:22,440
Your Honor,

293
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:23,670
we've searched all night,

294
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:24,840
but still haven't found Qiao Ruolan.

295
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,670
That's not a good sign.

296
00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:30,670
Send more people.
Expand the search area.

297
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:31,640
Keep searching.

298
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:32,710
Got it.

299
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,080
She will come.

300
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,440
She will come.

301
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,440
She will.

302
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:44,640
I knew it.

303
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,080
Mr. Qi.

304
00:12:49,710 --> 00:12:50,350
This is for you.

305
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,030
Did Luo Shu send you here?

306
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:54,030
No.

307
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:56,000
I heard that you're leaving,

308
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,470
so I made some pancakes

309
00:12:57,470 --> 00:12:58,520
for you to eat on the road.

310
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:02,400
Don't forget to eat.

311
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,350
Thank you.

312
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:06,030
She really knows how to stay calm.

313
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,230
I knew it.

314
00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:12,200
Mr. Qi.

315
00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:16,710
I heard that you're leaving,

316
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,670
so I called a carriage for you
in the name of the yamen.

317
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:22,000
Thank you.

318
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:32,910
I can't lose patience.

319
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:35,590
I'm the most composed man.

320
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:42,080
There you are.

321
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,000
Mr. Qi,

322
00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:44,030
I heard that you're leaving.

323
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:45,110
You have such delicate skin.

324
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:46,150
Be careful of the sun on the road.

325
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:46,760
Okay.

326
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:47,320
Take care.

327
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:47,880
You too.

328
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,280
Anyway,

329
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:04,790
we've solved

330
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:06,710
several cases together.

331
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:12,760
Why didn't she try to keep me?

332
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:44,760
Young Master, shall we?

333
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,030
Mr. Qi, you're leaving.

334
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,230
I'm here to say goodbye.

335
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,470
Have a safe journey.

336
00:15:00,590 --> 00:15:02,550
Please give our regards to your father.

337
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:04,710
Okay.

338
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,320
It's ready, Young Master.

339
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,350
We can go now.

340
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:22,280
Let's go back.

341
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:32,400
Lian Shu,

342
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:34,320
you've known it.

343
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,350
She never liked me,

344
00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:35,960
right?

345
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,710
Young Master, think in another way.

346
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,200
You've got

347
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:41,840
plenty of people like you.

348
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,110
You don't have to care about her.

349
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:44,670
Besides,

350
00:15:44,670 --> 00:15:45,840
when we get back home,

351
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:47,030
those ladies

352
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:49,280
will all treat you like a treasure.

353
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:51,760
That's different.

354
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
I heard from Baozi

355
00:15:55,590 --> 00:15:57,150
that you had an argument with Mr. Qi.

356
00:15:58,670 --> 00:15:59,280
No wonder

357
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:00,550
you didn't go to say goodbye.

358
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:03,400
It's not because of that.

359
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:05,030
Then why?

360
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:07,790
I'm afraid that if I go to say goodbye,

361
00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:09,200
it'll be complicated.

362
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:10,320
He might not want to leave

363
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,350
when he sees me.

364
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,320
If he doesn't want to leave,
he can stay.

365
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:15,760
Actually,

366
00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:17,230
I think Mr. Qi is fun.

367
00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:19,880
He's too impulsive,

368
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:20,440
and so unworldly

369
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:22,000
with a sheltered life.

370
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:23,760
It's dangerous for him
to travel outside.

371
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:25,150
It's better for him to go back home.

372
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,030
I've sent someone

373
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,080
to deliver Ruolan's obituary notice
to her husband's family.

374
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,230
Although

375
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:36,150
Ruolan was married,

376
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:38,470
this mansion

377
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,440
is still her home.

378
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:43,200
Before her husband arrives,

379
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:45,400
I will do

380
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,790
whatever I can.

381
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:49,640
You're thoughtful.

382
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:55,710
Both of them have passed away,

383
00:16:57,470 --> 00:16:58,960
perhaps they won't feel lonely.

384
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:01,960
I regret it.

385
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:05,640
I shouldn't have argued with her.

386
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:07,470
If I had given her what she wanted,

387
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:08,430
maybe

388
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,400
she wouldn't have run around,

389
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,680
and she wouldn't have
met with misfortune.

390
00:17:13,830 --> 00:17:15,160
I am sorry for your loss.

391
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,830
What's your plan in the future?

392
00:17:23,590 --> 00:17:25,190
I said

393
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,800
that I wanted to fulfill Ruhui's wish,

394
00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:30,110
running this liquor distillery well.

395
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:32,110
But now,

396
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:34,280
Ruhui's gone,

397
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:36,760
Ruolan's gone,

398
00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:38,830
and even the secret recipe is gone.

399
00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:42,000
I'll never make Jinrui Liquor again.

400
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,830
I'm so useless.

401
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:47,350
What...what can I do?

402
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:48,880
I'm so useless.

403
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:50,950
There will always be a way.

404
00:17:54,070 --> 00:17:55,920
I'll just play it by ear.

405
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:56,760
Mr. He.

406
00:17:58,710 --> 00:17:59,470
Mr. He,

407
00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:00,710
I just went through
Mrs. Qiao's belongings

408
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:01,680
and found another letter.

409
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:02,520
It was for you.

410
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:04,590
Give it to me.

411
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:10,780
[Qiao's Jinrui Liquor]

412
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:15,070
The recipe! The secret recipe!

413
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:16,680
Ruhui really left the recipe

414
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:17,560
to me.

415
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:21,880
Thank goodness!

416
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:23,160
Thank you.

417
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:24,830
Ruhui,

418
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:26,070
I won't

419
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:27,470
let you down.

420
00:18:30,430 --> 00:18:31,230
Congratulations.

421
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:33,680
All is well that ends well.

422
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:37,310
When the Jinrui Liquor
is brewed this year,

423
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:38,040
please remember

424
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:39,160
to invite us for a drink.

425
00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:41,680
Sure.

426
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:43,920
Goodbye.

427
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:44,800
Goodbye.

428
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:46,400
Forgive me for not seeing you off.

429
00:18:54,190 --> 00:18:56,040
Thanks to you, Hua,

430
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,470
otherwise we would have lost everything.

431
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,230
It's not settled yet.

432
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,190
Only by brewing the Jinrui Liquor,

433
00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:05,280
can there be a constant stream of money

434
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,230
flowing into our pockets.

435
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:07,590
Stay calm.

436
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:10,880
Yes, you're right.

437
00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:12,640
I need to hurry up to brew the liquor.

438
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:15,880
By the way,

439
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:17,040
Qiu

440
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:18,310
is due to give birth soon.

441
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:19,400
Aren't you supposed to

442
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,640
bring her into the mansion?

443
00:19:22,310 --> 00:19:23,680
Now?

444
00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:25,000
It's...

445
00:19:26,710 --> 00:19:27,800
not appropriate.

446
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,160
What's inappropriate about?

447
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,430
Qiao Ruolan is dead.

448
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:32,680
We also got the secret recipe.

449
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:34,280
No one blocks your way.

450
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:38,830
Yeah.

451
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:41,590
The mansion and the liquor distillery

452
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:44,070
will all belong to me.

453
00:20:32,950 --> 00:20:34,110
Slow down.

454
00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:35,760
Don't harm the baby.

455
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:36,710
Be careful.

456
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:51,880
Be careful.

457
00:20:52,070 --> 00:20:52,880
Take your time.

458
00:20:57,110 --> 00:20:57,920
Do you like it?

459
00:20:58,230 --> 00:21:00,400
Yes.

460
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:02,710
Actually,

461
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,160
I just want you

462
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:07,070
to stay with me and the baby.

463
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,950
That's all I want.

464
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:13,760
I'm right here with you now.

465
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:16,280
From now on,

466
00:21:16,430 --> 00:21:18,470
I'll be with you every day.

467
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:23,800
Darling,

468
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:26,880
you're so nice to me.

469
00:21:27,470 --> 00:21:29,830
What good deeds did I do in my past life

470
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:31,520
to deserve such fortune?

471
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:38,680

472
00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:40,400
one night cooler than the last it goes.

473
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:43,230
As White Dew meets autumn breeze,

474
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:45,190
one night cooler than the last it goes.

475
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:50,520
Today, we start brewing Jinrui Liquor.

476
00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:54,310
I, He Shenwei,
am here with sincere prayers.

477
00:21:54,710 --> 00:21:57,830
Please exert your power
to oversee what is under your guidance.

478
00:21:58,070 --> 00:22:01,310
May our wishes be fulfilled
without regrets.

[The Spirit Tablet of Ancestor Du Kang]
[*The brewing master]

480
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:22,520
Open the cellar!

Open the cellar!

Quickly.

Congratulations, Mr. He!

Congratulations!

Thank you!

487
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:05,640
It's all thanks to you, Mr. He.

488
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:07,230
We were worried

489
00:24:07,230 --> 00:24:08,000
we wouldn't get to taste

490
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,070
Jinrui Liquor this year.

491
00:24:09,070 --> 00:24:10,400
I'm not talented,

492
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:10,920
but I can't

493
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:12,560
dishonor the century-old brand

494
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:13,710
of our liquor distillery.

495
00:24:14,350 --> 00:24:16,160
Please come in.

496
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:16,880
Please.

497
00:24:22,190 --> 00:24:22,640
Here.

498
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:23,280
Please.

499
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:24,560
Everyone,

500
00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:26,190
these are Jinrui Liquor

501
00:24:26,190 --> 00:24:27,800
brewed this year.

502
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:29,520
You can send people

503
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:30,760
to check and pick up the goods.

504
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:31,520
Mr. He,

505
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:33,040
we have a small request.

506
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:33,880
Please feel free to say.

507
00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:35,590
Could you please open a jar

508
00:24:35,590 --> 00:24:36,350
and let us have a taste?

509
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:37,070
Yes.

510
00:24:37,070 --> 00:24:38,280
Yeah. Let us have a taste.

511
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:39,230
So,

512
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:41,310
you don't trust me.

513
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:43,800
No, I didn't mean it.

514
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:44,920
It's just that we all know

515
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:45,950
this is your first time

516
00:24:45,950 --> 00:24:47,110
to supervise the brewing of
Jinrui Liquor.

517
00:24:47,230 --> 00:24:48,590
It's really memorable,

518
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:49,590
so we all want to

519
00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:50,760
have a sip.

520
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:51,640
Share in the joy.

521
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:52,950
Yeah, share in the joy.

522
00:24:53,230 --> 00:24:54,070
Share in the joy.

523
00:24:54,430 --> 00:24:55,760
Yes, let us have a sip.

524
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:56,400
Okay.

525
00:24:57,110 --> 00:24:58,000
Today,

526
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:00,160
let's all have a drink together.

527
00:25:00,430 --> 00:25:02,950
You will also be my witnesses.

528
00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:04,230
Okay!

529
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:21,110
Please.

530
00:25:21,350 --> 00:25:22,640
Thanks, Mr. He.

531
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:24,800
Let's taste it.

532
00:25:25,430 --> 00:25:26,830
The color is not right.

533
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:28,880
Isn't Jinrui Liquor

534
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,830
supposed to be golden yellow,
like that of a tulip?

535
00:25:30,830 --> 00:25:31,160
Yeah.

536
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:33,000
Why is it brown?

537
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:34,280
Why?

538
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:36,190
And there's no fragrance
when the jar is opened.

539
00:25:39,590 --> 00:25:40,920
Don't worry, everyone.

540
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,040
The taste

541
00:25:42,110 --> 00:25:43,430
will be great.

542
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,560
Let's drink together.

543
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:47,430
Please taste it.

544
00:25:47,430 --> 00:25:48,230
Alright.

545
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:49,710
Come on.

546
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:56,710
What is this?

547
00:25:56,950 --> 00:25:58,310
Are you trying to fool us?

548
00:25:58,310 --> 00:25:59,560
This is not Jinrui Liquor at all.

549
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:00,070
We want

550
00:26:00,070 --> 00:26:01,230
Jinrui Liquor.

551
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:05,520
Refund!

552
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:06,310
Let me explain.

553
00:26:06,830 --> 00:26:08,230
Refund! Refund!

554
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:09,640
Let me explain!

555
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,280
Refund!

556
00:26:11,310 --> 00:26:13,160
You're trying to fool us!

557
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:18,520
They're convinced

558
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:19,920
that I can't brew Jinrui Liquor.

559
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:21,640
They are waiting to see me fail

560
00:26:21,710 --> 00:26:23,160
and lose money.

561
00:26:24,070 --> 00:26:25,000
Now,

562
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:26,950
the secret recipe is fake.

563
00:26:27,070 --> 00:26:29,560
Jinrui Liquor is completely gone.

564
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:31,680
Calm down.

565
00:26:32,710 --> 00:26:34,310
You still got the liquor distillery.

566
00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:36,640
Without Jinrui Liquor,

567
00:26:37,070 --> 00:26:38,430
you can sell the distillery.

568
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:39,400
Hua, I can't do that.

569
00:26:40,110 --> 00:26:41,310
If I sell the distillery,

570
00:26:41,430 --> 00:26:43,160
I'll have nothing left.

571
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:46,560
You had nothing to begin with.

572
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:48,190
At this point,

573
00:26:48,430 --> 00:26:49,880
do you have any other choices?

574
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:51,470
No.

575
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:53,110
No way.

576
00:26:53,310 --> 00:26:54,400
The liquor distillery

577
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:55,280
was awarded to me,

578
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:56,880
but...

579
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,190
I wasn't allowed to sell it.

580
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:00,070
I can't

581
00:27:00,070 --> 00:27:01,560
cause trouble anymore.

582
00:27:14,950 --> 00:27:16,110
If you agree to sell,

583
00:27:17,190 --> 00:27:18,470
I'll find another solution for you.

584
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:19,400
Another solution?

585
00:27:19,950 --> 00:27:20,800
Will that work?

586
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:22,070
If it wasn't because

587
00:27:23,230 --> 00:27:24,470
you messed things up

588
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:25,760
and killed Qiao Ruolan,

589
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:27,310
would we be in such
a passive situation now?

590
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,280
If it weren't for me,

591
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:30,230
you would have been

592
00:27:30,430 --> 00:27:31,710
kicked out by Qiao Ruolan right now.

593
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,190
Hua,

594
00:27:36,430 --> 00:27:37,400
when Ruhui was alive,

595
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:38,830
the Qiao family made a good fortune.

596
00:27:38,830 --> 00:27:39,400
I also

597
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:41,000
had a comfortable life in here.

598
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:42,880
But you had to push me

599
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,110
to go for big wealth.

600
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,400
You said you were White Fan,

601
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:47,230
the wisest guy in Linfen,

602
00:27:47,430 --> 00:27:48,190
and there was nothing

603
00:27:48,190 --> 00:27:49,070
White Ants can't accomplish.

604
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:51,710
You're just a rabble.

605
00:27:52,830 --> 00:27:53,590
Before killing her,

606
00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:54,800
how could you not have verified

607
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:57,000
whether the secret recipe
was fake or not?

608
00:27:57,110 --> 00:27:58,830
Can you tell if it's fake or not?

609
00:27:58,830 --> 00:27:59,310
I...

610
00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:00,470
You used to

611
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:02,160
share a bed with Qiao Ruhui.

612
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,520
If you were capable,

613
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:06,040
would she treat you like a thief?

614
00:28:06,190 --> 00:28:06,760
Would she

615
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:07,950
keep the secret recipe from you?

616
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:08,680
I'm useless,

617
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:09,880
but I'm still
the head of the Qiao family.

618
00:28:10,110 --> 00:28:10,800
You still have to

619
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:11,760
curry favor with me,

620
00:28:11,830 --> 00:28:13,040
begging me to make you rich.

621
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:14,470
You make me rich?

622
00:28:17,430 --> 00:28:18,680
I'm telling you,

623
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:19,590
You are a

624
00:28:19,590 --> 00:28:21,560
complete idiot.

625
00:28:22,590 --> 00:28:23,040
I...

626
00:28:56,590 --> 00:28:57,920
Help!

627
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:59,920
Catch the thief.

628
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:01,560
Catch the thief!

629
00:29:02,350 --> 00:29:04,640
Catch the thief!

630
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,640
Catch the thief.

631
00:29:06,950 --> 00:29:07,920
She's a thief!

632
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:09,160
Thief!

633
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:09,680
Let go.

634
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:10,040
Thief!

635
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:10,680
Let go.

636
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:11,560
Catch the thief.

637
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:14,800
What's going on?

638
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:17,560
Qiu.

639
00:29:18,190 --> 00:29:20,230
Mr. He, this woman is a thief.

640
00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:21,230
I saw her

641
00:29:21,230 --> 00:29:22,680
stealing from the study.

642
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:24,920
No, I didn't.

643
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:26,680
I didn't.

644
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:27,830
Oh?

645
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:29,920
Then what's in your hand?

646
00:29:32,470 --> 00:29:33,400
What did you take?

647
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:35,000
What is it?

648
00:29:40,110 --> 00:29:40,920
You son of a...

649
00:29:43,110 --> 00:29:43,710
Mr. He.

650
00:29:44,710 --> 00:29:46,110
what should we do with this thief?

651
00:29:46,310 --> 00:29:47,350
I'm not a thief!

652
00:29:48,590 --> 00:29:49,400
Darling,

653
00:29:49,590 --> 00:29:50,830
won't you say something

654
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:51,920
for me and the baby?

655
00:29:54,590 --> 00:29:55,470
You want to know if she's a thief?

656
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:57,230
Just interrogate her.

657
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:58,920
Mr. He, don't worry.

658
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:01,160
The county yamen will uphold justice,

659
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:02,230
and will not

660
00:30:02,230 --> 00:30:03,680
let any bad person go.

661
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:06,830
Mr. He.

662
00:30:07,110 --> 00:30:08,560
Mr. He. We're in trouble.

663
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:10,350
What happened?

664
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:12,230
Mr. He.

665
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:13,920
The magistrate is here with his men.

666
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:21,680
Your Honor,

667
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:22,230
there's a carriage

668
00:30:22,230 --> 00:30:23,310
parked outside the back door.

669
00:30:23,310 --> 00:30:24,350
It could be the accomplice.

670
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:25,800
So I took the initiative to arrest him.

671
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:26,710
Bring him up.

672
00:30:26,710 --> 00:30:27,430
Got it.

673
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:28,920
Bring him up.

674
00:30:37,830 --> 00:30:38,710
Dr. Hua,

675
00:30:39,350 --> 00:30:40,230
you're waiting for Qiu,

676
00:30:40,230 --> 00:30:41,560
aren't you?

677
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,190
How could you two

678
00:30:44,190 --> 00:30:45,230
treat me like this?

679
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:47,310
You are so heartless.

680
00:30:47,350 --> 00:30:48,040
Shut up!

681
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:50,350
They will

682
00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:51,920
explain themselves later.

683
00:30:52,710 --> 00:30:53,710
He Shenwei,

684
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:56,000
clear up your own affairs first.

685
00:30:57,110 --> 00:30:57,920
Your Honor,

686
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:01,070
what do you mean?

687
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:03,190
I have nothing to confess.

688
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:04,110
Didn't you say

689
00:31:04,110 --> 00:31:05,880
that your relationship with Qiao Ruhui
was strong as gold,

690
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:07,000
and you were a devoted couple?

691
00:31:08,830 --> 00:31:09,520
Yes.

692
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:10,000
Then why,

693
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,680
less than a month
after your wife passed away,

694
00:31:11,950 --> 00:31:13,400
has your pregnant mistress

695
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:14,590
moved into the Qiao Mansion?

696
00:31:15,590 --> 00:31:16,230
I...

697
00:31:16,230 --> 00:31:17,800
You've been
having an affair with this woman.

698
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:19,070
No.

699
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:23,590
I was drunk,

700
00:31:24,110 --> 00:31:25,350
and made a mistake.

701
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:28,310
Then I thought
that the baby was innocent,

702
00:31:28,310 --> 00:31:30,880
so I brought her into the mansion.

703
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:31,880
Did your deceased wife

704
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:33,280
know about this?

705
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:36,280
No.

706
00:31:36,350 --> 00:31:37,230
Was she really sick for a long time

707
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:38,590
because of her illness?

708
00:31:39,070 --> 00:31:40,000
Or was there something else

709
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:40,880
that you were hiding?

710
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:42,350
Was that will

711
00:31:42,350 --> 00:31:43,640
really written by Qiao Ruhui?

712
00:31:43,830 --> 00:31:45,920
Or did you force her to do so?

713
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:49,880
Did you kill

714
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:51,160
Qiao Ruhui?

715
00:31:51,430 --> 00:31:52,830
No, no.

716
00:31:52,830 --> 00:31:53,400
Say it!

717
00:31:53,430 --> 00:31:54,880
I...

718
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:55,830
I just...

719
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:57,230
I...

720
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:58,310
Your Honor,

721
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:01,760
Qiao Ruhui died of illness.

722
00:32:02,590 --> 00:32:04,400
I used to examine her.

723
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:07,160
She was deficient in qi and blood
after a miscarriage.

724
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:08,950
Her condition worsened
in an unexpected way,

725
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:10,110
and eventually passed away
due to weakness.

726
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:12,230
Yes.

727
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:14,110
Dr. Hua is right.

728
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:15,950
She died of illness.

729
00:32:16,230 --> 00:32:18,830
You can't frame an innocent person.

730
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:19,710
Your Honor,

731
00:32:20,190 --> 00:32:22,710
do you have evidence?

732
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:24,950
You can't just force a confession.

733
00:32:28,230 --> 00:32:30,000
These letters are the evidence.

734
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:32,190
They're all forged by him.

735
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:33,880
You...

736
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:35,070
You're slinging mud at me.

737
00:32:35,070 --> 00:32:36,000
I didn't do it.

738
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,040
You're good at calligraphy

739
00:32:37,710 --> 00:32:39,430
and can imitate
styles of famous calligraphers.

740
00:32:39,950 --> 00:32:41,000
It was a piece of cake for you

741
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,190
to imitate Ruhui's handwriting.

742
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:43,760
But you couldn't

743
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:44,680
imitate her tone,

744
00:32:45,070 --> 00:32:45,800
nor could you imitate

745
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:47,760
the intimacy between her and her sister.

746
00:32:48,310 --> 00:32:50,760
You forged

747
00:32:51,070 --> 00:32:52,400
these letters and her will.

748
00:32:53,470 --> 00:32:55,400
You're making up stories.

749
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:56,760
These were

750
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:58,160
all written by Ruhui.

751
00:32:58,520 --> 00:32:59,070
Alright.

752
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:00,800
What about the secret recipe?

753
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:02,680
Did she write it to you?

754
00:33:03,070 --> 00:33:04,430
Then why did she leave you

755
00:33:04,430 --> 00:33:05,430
a fake recipe?

756
00:33:06,310 --> 00:33:07,110
The secret recipe.

757
00:33:08,190 --> 00:33:09,680
You were there that day.

758
00:33:10,110 --> 00:33:11,590
You know how I got it.

759
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:13,430
How was I supposed to know

760
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:14,560
that the secret recipe was fake?

761
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:15,400
Just stop it!

762
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:17,350
Today, I'm gonna show you

763
00:33:17,710 --> 00:33:19,310
the overwhelming evidence.

764
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:21,070
Come in.

765
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:03,110
Didn't expect it, huh?

766
00:34:04,430 --> 00:34:05,470
I'm not dead.

767
00:34:13,910 --> 00:34:15,430
Luo Shu, are you alright?

768
00:34:15,950 --> 00:34:16,760
You go first.

769
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:18,040
I can't

770
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:19,280
leave you here alone.

771
00:34:19,430 --> 00:34:20,520
I'll go find you.

772
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:21,360
Trust me.

773
00:34:26,950 --> 00:34:28,710
Ruolan should be safe now.

774
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:31,280
You distracted people's attention
away from her.

775
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:34,000
I need to go find her
as soon as possible.

776
00:34:34,390 --> 00:34:35,320
But please,

777
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:36,630
order to continue the search

778
00:34:36,630 --> 00:34:37,280
and spread the news that

779
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:38,950
she has drowned in the Fen River.

780
00:34:38,950 --> 00:34:39,600
Okay.

781
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:42,320
Let's devise a plan to mislead them,

782
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:44,870
so as to uncover the truth.

783
00:34:46,870 --> 00:34:47,760
I told you.

784
00:34:48,630 --> 00:34:49,870
How could something

785
00:34:49,870 --> 00:34:50,870
written under threat

786
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:52,840
possibly be true?

787
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:55,190
After you got the fake recipe

788
00:34:55,190 --> 00:34:56,670
from the White Ant,

789
00:34:56,910 --> 00:34:58,080
you imitated Ruhui's handwriting

790
00:34:58,080 --> 00:34:59,670
to make a copy,

791
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:00,840
and asked the maid

792
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:02,430
to pretend
you got the recipe unexpectedly

793
00:35:02,430 --> 00:35:03,950
in front of us.

794
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,600
Am I right?

795
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:07,150
Your Honor, please spare my life.

796
00:35:07,150 --> 00:35:09,230
I'm really sorry.

797
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:11,360
Mr. He made me do this.

798
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:11,950
You...

799
00:35:11,950 --> 00:35:14,280
He Shenwei. Hua Miao.

800
00:35:14,950 --> 00:35:15,630
You two

801
00:35:15,630 --> 00:35:17,040
murdered Qiao Ruhui,

802
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,560
and kidnapped Qiao Ruolan.

803
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:19,710
Do you plead guilty?

804
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:21,080
I...

805
00:35:21,190 --> 00:35:22,000
Your Honor,

806
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:24,600
I don't know what crime I've committed.

807
00:35:25,430 --> 00:35:26,710
I'm just a doctor.

808
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:29,150
I only cure people. I don't kill them.

809
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:30,600
Did you

810
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:32,870
change Qiao Ruhui's prescription?

811
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:38,150
The prescriptions I made for Mrs. Qiao

812
00:35:38,150 --> 00:35:39,190
all have copies kept.

813
00:35:39,430 --> 00:35:40,800
People in the pharmacy can testify.

814
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:43,470
The medicines I prescribed were
to circulate blood and dissipate stasis,

815
00:35:43,630 --> 00:35:44,910
as well as to nourish yin and tonify qi.

816
00:35:44,910 --> 00:35:45,870
You can go to verify.

817
00:35:46,910 --> 00:35:48,320
How could it be murder?

818
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:49,630
Besides,

819
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:52,040
I only diagnose and prescribe.

820
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:53,320
It was always Mr. He

821
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:56,910
to fill the prescription.

822
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:59,950
So you're saying that

823
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:01,190
you didn't collaborate
with the White Ant

824
00:36:01,470 --> 00:36:03,390
to kidnap Qiao Ruolan and force her

825
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:04,710
to write down the secret recipe?

826
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,000
What is White Ant?

827
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:08,430
I don't understand.

828
00:36:09,190 --> 00:36:10,520
I've never done

829
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:11,760
anything illegal.

830
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:15,430
Then why did you come here tonight?

831
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:17,870
My cousin said

832
00:36:17,870 --> 00:36:19,150
she had an argument with Shenwei.

833
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:20,320
she was so angry

834
00:36:20,430 --> 00:36:21,760
that she wanted to go back for a while.

835
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:24,000
I was worried about her pregnancy

836
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,040
and the inconvenience of walking,

837
00:36:25,150 --> 00:36:26,840
so I borrowed a carriage

838
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:27,950
to pick her up.

839
00:36:30,430 --> 00:36:30,950
Your Honor,

840
00:36:31,710 --> 00:36:33,430
it seems Dr. Hua is innocent.

841
00:36:34,190 --> 00:36:35,280
Collaborating with the White Ant,

842
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,560
murdering Qiao Ruhui,

843
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:37,670
and kidnapping Qiao Ruolan,

844
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:39,040
these are serious crimes.

845
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,360
Someone has to take responsibility.

846
00:36:40,470 --> 00:36:41,430
Of course.

847
00:36:42,390 --> 00:36:43,190
He Shenwei,

848
00:36:44,150 --> 00:36:45,390
No, it wasn't me.

849
00:36:45,390 --> 00:36:46,520
I didn't do it!

850
00:36:46,670 --> 00:36:47,560
I didn't do it!

851
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,520
Qiao Ruhui has just passed away.

852
00:36:49,710 --> 00:36:50,870
As for you, a son-in-law,

853
00:36:50,870 --> 00:36:52,280
there are already rumors.

854
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:54,230
At this time,

855
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:55,870
you brought your pregnant mistress

856
00:36:55,870 --> 00:36:57,120
into the mansion.

857
00:36:57,630 --> 00:36:58,950
Isn't it obvious to everyone

858
00:36:58,950 --> 00:37:00,360
that you betrayed your wife?

859
00:37:00,670 --> 00:37:01,360
Qiu

860
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:02,670
is due to give birth soon.

861
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:03,710
Aren't you supposed to

862
00:37:03,710 --> 00:37:05,040
bring her into the mansion?

863
00:37:06,630 --> 00:37:08,000
Now?

864
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:09,390
It's...

865
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:12,150
not appropriate.

866
00:37:15,710 --> 00:37:17,080
What do you think you can get?

867
00:37:17,390 --> 00:37:18,080
You'll have nothing left

868
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:18,950
after she takes

869
00:37:18,950 --> 00:37:20,360
all your money tonight.

870
00:37:20,670 --> 00:37:21,600
You'll have nothing left

871
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:22,710
after she renames

872
00:37:22,710 --> 00:37:23,710
the liquor distillery in the future.

873
00:37:26,190 --> 00:37:28,870
Hua Miao, you're so vicious.

874
00:37:29,390 --> 00:37:30,470
You set me up!

875
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:34,190
Your Honor, I confess.

876
00:37:34,470 --> 00:37:35,360
I'll tell everything.

877
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,150
The murder and kidnapping

878
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:38,710
were all Hua Miao's ideas.

879
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:39,120
You...

880
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:40,760
You slander me!

881
00:37:41,390 --> 00:37:42,800
Since I married into the Qiao family,

882
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:45,230
he had been up to no good,

883
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:47,630
approaching me

884
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:48,600
and misleading me.

885
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:49,870
He tried to split me off from Ruhui.

886
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:50,800
It's all him!

887
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:53,390
Your Honor, I...

888
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:56,390
Ruhui had just suffered a miscarriage.

889
00:37:57,560 --> 00:37:58,600
The doctor said

890
00:37:58,950 --> 00:38:00,710
she couldn't have children anymore.

891
00:38:01,950 --> 00:38:04,280
I was heartbroken.

892
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:06,230
Do you really think

893
00:38:06,230 --> 00:38:07,870
she wants to have a child with you?

894
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:14,080
Since you married into the Qiao family,

895
00:38:14,710 --> 00:38:16,560
when has she ever
looked at you with respect?

896
00:38:16,870 --> 00:38:17,950
Not to mention her,

897
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:19,280
even the servants of the family

898
00:38:19,470 --> 00:38:20,910
and the workers
in the liquor distillery,

899
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:22,800
who has ever treated you as the Master?

900
00:38:24,910 --> 00:38:25,760
Do you know why

901
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:27,320
she was so desperate to have a child?

902
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:29,600
She wanted

903
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:30,800
an heir for herself.

904
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:34,000
The baby's surname will be Qiao,

905
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:34,910
not He.

906
00:38:35,950 --> 00:38:37,390
Now she can't have children anymore.

907
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:39,150
In a few years,

908
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:41,280
she'll adopt one

909
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:42,470
from her little sister.

910
00:38:43,710 --> 00:38:44,520
By then,

911
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:47,280
you'll be raising someone else's child.

912
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:50,870
With all your life,

913
00:38:50,950 --> 00:38:51,760
in the end,

914
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:53,390
you'll still be

915
00:38:53,390 --> 00:38:55,190
a poor devil with nothing.

916
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,630
No, that's not true.

917
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:10,150
Don't you want to be

918
00:39:10,150 --> 00:39:11,630
a real man?

919
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:16,120
Don't you want to have your own child?

920
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:17,840
Me?

921
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:22,870
Therefore,

922
00:39:23,470 --> 00:39:25,120
I started an affair with Qiu.

923
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
He kept hinting at me

924
00:39:28,230 --> 00:39:29,520
to get rid of Ruhui.

925
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:32,120
I shouldn't have let Qiu be with you.

926
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:41,080
Hua, I will treat her well.

927
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:45,360
You can't even marry her.

928
00:39:45,870 --> 00:39:46,910
How can you treat her well?

929
00:39:47,390 --> 00:39:49,000
I also want to
bring her into the mansion,

930
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:50,280
but you know that

931
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:51,190
Ruhui will never

932
00:39:51,190 --> 00:39:52,430
allow me to take a concubine.

933
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:56,360
What if she's gone someday?

934
00:40:02,910 --> 00:40:04,670
She looks sick and weak.

935
00:40:04,950 --> 00:40:07,600
She might not make it through.

936
00:40:08,470 --> 00:40:09,950
If she's really gone,

937
00:40:10,670 --> 00:40:12,080
will you marry Qiu?

938
00:40:14,910 --> 00:40:16,520
Yes.

939
00:40:16,950 --> 00:40:17,760
Of course, I will.

940
00:40:18,950 --> 00:40:20,280
But...

941
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:20,840
Alright,

942
00:40:23,870 --> 00:40:25,320
that is enough.

943
00:40:25,910 --> 00:40:27,040
Hua Miao prepared the medicine

944
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,230
and asked me to give it to Ruhui.

945
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:31,320
He said those medicines

946
00:40:31,470 --> 00:40:32,950
looked nothing wrong on the surface,

947
00:40:33,710 --> 00:40:36,390
but they were incompatible
with Ruhui's constitution,

948
00:40:37,150 --> 00:40:39,000
making her weaker.

949
00:40:39,870 --> 00:40:40,800
After taking for a year or so,

950
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:41,800
she would be gone.

951
00:40:42,230 --> 00:40:42,910
By then,

952
00:40:42,910 --> 00:40:44,560
everyone would think

953
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:46,670
that she had died of illness.

954
00:40:53,870 --> 00:40:55,390
Ruhui,

955
00:40:57,230 --> 00:40:58,470
drink it while it's hot.

956
00:40:58,600 --> 00:40:59,430
No.

957
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,080
I've been drinking it for so long,

958
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:03,600
but I don't feel any better.

959
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,120
Don't worry.

960
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:08,320
Dr. Hua is skillful,

961
00:41:08,430 --> 00:41:09,870
you'll get better soon.

962
00:41:11,150 --> 00:41:12,360
Come on, drink it.

963
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:13,280
Wait,

964
00:41:16,630 --> 00:41:18,840
there is an expenditure of 200 liang
in the account.

965
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:21,040
What did you use it for?

966
00:41:22,870 --> 00:41:24,470
I donated it to the temple

967
00:41:24,630 --> 00:41:25,600
for your blessings.

968
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:28,950
What about this?

969
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:32,760
What?

970
00:41:33,910 --> 00:41:36,670
These...

971
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:39,360
I probably...

972
00:41:46,630 --> 00:41:47,320
I...

973
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:48,630
I'll go heat the medicine for you.

974
00:41:50,710 --> 00:41:52,150
Ruhui is clever

975
00:41:53,190 --> 00:41:54,360
and she noticed.

976
00:41:54,910 --> 00:41:55,560
I found out

977
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:57,280
she wrote
to her little sister for help,

978
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:00,320
so I intercepted the letter.

979
00:42:14,580 --> 00:42:16,460
[Ruolan, I need to talk to you.]

980
00:42:17,780 --> 00:42:19,180
[Ruhui]

981
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:33,460
[To Ruolan]

982
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:47,150
Hua, what should we do?

983
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:48,950
She might have noticed.

984
00:42:48,950 --> 00:42:50,560
She wanted to kick me out.

985
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:52,230
If her sister finds out too,

986
00:42:52,230 --> 00:42:52,670
then I...

987
00:42:52,670 --> 00:42:54,000
Let her have this medicine.

988
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:57,520
It'll be over for good.
