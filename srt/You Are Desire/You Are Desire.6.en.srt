<i>[Episode 6: I Want to Know Your Secret]</i>

19
00:01:33,754 --> 00:01:35,111
But

20
00:01:35,111 --> 00:01:37,151
I warn you, new friends of hers,

21
00:01:37,151 --> 00:01:39,351
if she gets bullied again in the future,

22
00:01:39,351 --> 00:01:40,490
I will still come.

23
00:01:43,411 --> 00:01:44,448
Don't worry.

24
00:01:45,051 --> 00:01:46,304
We won't give you that chance.

25
00:01:49,536 --> 00:01:50,592
Bye.

26
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,288
Bye.

27
00:01:54,891 --> 00:01:56,591
I knew Juan was the best,

28
00:01:56,591 --> 00:01:58,720
making him lose badly
and never have the guts to show up again.

29
00:02:10,011 --> 00:02:11,360
Where are you going?

30
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:17,760
I-I-I got a dormitory at the school.

31
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,104
I'm moving in today.

32
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:22,848
You're not going to come back?

33
00:02:23,834 --> 00:02:24,896
No.

34
00:02:26,075 --> 00:02:27,075
Your dad agreed?

35
00:02:27,755 --> 00:02:29,554
He agreed, or else how could I have applied?

36
00:02:31,075 --> 00:02:32,195
Your dad signed for you?

37
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:33,854
You didn't sign for me,

38
00:02:33,854 --> 00:02:35,015
and you didn't let me ask someone else.

39
00:02:35,015 --> 00:02:36,064
Someone else?

40
00:02:38,755 --> 00:02:40,155
You asked someone else to sign for your dad?

41
00:02:40,155 --> 00:02:41,515
Well, you don't have to worry about it.

42
00:02:41,515 --> 00:02:42,775
Anyway, from today on,

43
00:02:42,775 --> 00:02:44,035
I won't be living here.

44
00:02:44,035 --> 00:02:46,374
Let's write off our past.

45
00:02:46,374 --> 00:02:48,755
What are you talking about?

46
00:02:48,755 --> 00:02:50,215
Isn't this what you wanted?

47
00:02:50,215 --> 00:02:51,975
From now on, you'll live here by yourself.

48
00:02:51,975 --> 00:02:53,955
We won't need to look at each other
unpleasantly.

49
00:02:58,688 --> 00:02:59,776
Here you go.

50
00:03:00,448 --> 00:03:01,504
Wait a minute.

51
00:03:04,394 --> 00:03:05,408
You keep this.

52
00:03:06,315 --> 00:03:07,840
I don't want you back to bother me again.

53
00:03:17,216 --> 00:03:18,272
Thanks.

54
00:03:35,714 --> 00:03:37,795
Why did they assign so much homework again?

55
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:41,555
A perfectly good National Day holiday

56
00:03:41,555 --> 00:03:43,075
is ruined by this damn paper.

57
00:03:44,864 --> 00:03:47,035
Planning another monthly pop quiz, aren't they?

58
00:03:47,035 --> 00:03:48,755
After National Day, it's midterms.

59
00:03:49,344 --> 00:03:50,434
So annoying.

60
00:03:52,915 --> 00:03:55,715
Juan, let's go relax

61
00:03:55,715 --> 00:03:56,995
during this seven-day National Day holiday.

62
00:03:56,995 --> 00:03:58,154
Let's invite He Songnan.

63
00:03:58,674 --> 00:04:01,195
The holidays are when business is best.

64
00:04:01,195 --> 00:04:02,235
I have to mind the shop.

65
00:04:02,755 --> 00:04:03,874
You're such a downer.

66
00:04:04,512 --> 00:04:05,514
What about you?

67
00:04:05,514 --> 00:04:07,255
I don't want a holiday. I just want to study.

68
00:04:07,255 --> 00:04:08,355
Studying makes me happy.

69
00:04:13,115 --> 00:04:14,515
You two are going to waste

70
00:04:15,154 --> 00:04:16,794
the good seven days.

71
00:04:18,464 --> 00:04:19,635
Li Lin,

72
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,254
Li Lin, let's…

73
00:04:22,254 --> 00:04:23,315
May ask you a problem?

74
00:04:24,234 --> 00:04:25,248
It's this one.

75
00:04:26,592 --> 00:04:28,755
I'll write you a formula,
and you'll understand.

76
00:04:31,515 --> 00:04:33,155
I knew you were the go-to person.

77
00:04:33,155 --> 00:04:34,675
- Thank you.
- It's nothing.

78
00:04:36,714 --> 00:04:38,115
I'll be in the shop during the holiday.

79
00:04:39,264 --> 00:04:41,995
If you're bored, you can come.

80
00:04:52,755 --> 00:04:54,795
The teachers can't notice this color, right?

81
00:04:54,795 --> 00:04:56,034
So pretty.

82
00:04:56,034 --> 00:04:57,414
You're really smart.

83
00:04:57,414 --> 00:04:59,695
This color makes your nails shiny,

84
00:04:59,695 --> 00:05:01,472
and the teachers will definitely not notice.

85
00:05:11,914 --> 00:05:14,560
By the way, my dad got me an open ticket.

86
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,014
I can go wherever I want,

87
00:05:16,014 --> 00:05:17,915
but I find domestic travel too boring.

88
00:05:17,915 --> 00:05:20,256
I'm thinking about going to Iceland

89
00:05:20,256 --> 00:05:21,335
or New Zealand.

90
00:05:21,335 --> 00:05:22,735
The time is too short.

91
00:05:22,735 --> 00:05:24,835
If I had a month,
that would be enough to have fun.

92
00:05:24,835 --> 00:05:27,354
I really envy you for having such a good dad.

93
00:05:28,274 --> 00:05:31,435
Like me. I can only play around locally.

94
00:05:32,555 --> 00:05:34,794
Xu Ruyi, where are you planning
to go for the holiday?

95
00:05:36,034 --> 00:05:40,375
I-I-I'll just read in the dorm.

96
00:05:40,375 --> 00:05:41,474
Reading?

97
00:05:42,354 --> 00:05:43,654
What era is it?

98
00:05:43,654 --> 00:05:45,555
There are still people in the dorm
during the holiday.

99
00:05:45,555 --> 00:05:47,355
No wonder you don't have friends.

100
00:05:47,355 --> 00:05:48,794
I am her friend.

101
00:05:50,555 --> 00:05:51,935
Whether she wants to travel or read,

102
00:05:51,935 --> 00:05:53,154
isn't it all her freedom?

103
00:05:53,696 --> 00:05:55,035
I didn't say anything about you.

104
00:05:55,035 --> 00:05:56,194
Why are you butting in?

105
00:05:56,194 --> 00:05:57,695
I'm not accusing you. What are you mad about?

106
00:05:57,695 --> 00:05:59,808
Lin Yujing, why are you everywhere?

107
00:05:59,808 --> 00:06:00,955
What's it to you?

108
00:06:02,115 --> 00:06:03,354
Never mind.

109
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,315
Annoying.

110
00:06:16,195 --> 00:06:17,255
Don't mind them.

111
00:06:17,255 --> 00:06:19,095
Let them say whatever they want.

112
00:06:19,095 --> 00:06:20,115
You just ignore them.

113
00:06:20,675 --> 00:06:23,195
Actually, there are
quite a few fun places in Pucheng.

114
00:06:23,195 --> 00:06:24,594
We can go visit them together.

115
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,336
Okay.

116
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,632
Hello?

117
00:06:37,632 --> 00:06:39,264
<i>Where are you?</i>

118
00:06:39,264 --> 00:06:40,715
I'm at school.

119
00:06:40,715 --> 00:06:42,315
What's wrong, suddenly calling me?

120
00:06:43,264 --> 00:06:44,615
<i>Your dad is coming back.</i>

121
00:06:44,615 --> 00:06:45,794
<i>You'd better come back now.</i>

122
00:06:48,896 --> 00:06:49,984
Got it.

123
00:07:07,115 --> 00:07:08,755
How come they're not at home so late?

124
00:07:10,304 --> 00:07:11,875
I'll call Mingxiu.

125
00:07:20,576 --> 00:07:22,432
<i>Are you Lin Yujing's father?</i>

126
00:07:22,944 --> 00:07:24,275
Yes, I am.

127
00:07:24,275 --> 00:07:26,880
<i>Lin Yujing took a leave of absence today</i>

128
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,055
<i>and didn't stay at school.</i>

129
00:07:28,055 --> 00:07:31,394
<i>Please confirm
whether she has returned home on time.</i>

130
00:07:46,995 --> 00:07:49,075
Where have you been?
Why did you come back so late?

131
00:07:49,075 --> 00:07:50,455
Why did you come back early?

132
00:07:50,455 --> 00:07:51,515
I'm asking you.

133
00:07:52,034 --> 00:07:53,515
Why did you come back so late?

134
00:07:53,515 --> 00:07:55,234
I had dinner with my classmates.

135
00:07:57,856 --> 00:07:58,912
Come with me.

136
00:08:11,635 --> 00:08:12,755
Your head teacher contacted me.

137
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,515
Why are you living at school behind my back?

138
00:08:16,032 --> 00:08:17,215
Didn't I tell you?

139
00:08:17,215 --> 00:08:18,274
I don't allow you to live at school.

140
00:08:19,515 --> 00:08:20,635
All our classmates live at school.

141
00:08:21,315 --> 00:08:22,315
It's more efficient for studying.

142
00:08:23,115 --> 00:08:24,315
Don't argue.

143
00:08:24,315 --> 00:08:25,554
Tell me honestly.

144
00:08:25,554 --> 00:08:26,955
Who gave you this idea?

145
00:08:26,955 --> 00:08:30,035
Impersonating me,
signing on the school lodging form.

146
00:08:31,136 --> 00:08:32,255
Tell me who it was.

147
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:33,856
I'm going to report it to the school.

148
00:08:33,856 --> 00:08:35,008
You don't tell me?

149
00:08:35,552 --> 00:08:36,915
I'll tell your head teacher now

150
00:08:36,915 --> 00:08:37,955
you won't live in the dorm.

151
00:08:37,955 --> 00:08:39,594
I'll do it whether you agree or not.

152
00:08:40,474 --> 00:08:41,575
I don't want to live here.

153
00:08:41,575 --> 00:08:42,912
I don't want to live with you.

154
00:08:42,912 --> 00:08:43,934
Say it again.

155
00:08:43,934 --> 00:08:45,054
I don't want to live here.

156
00:08:45,054 --> 00:08:46,095
This is not my home.

157
00:08:46,095 --> 00:08:47,114
I am your dad.

158
00:08:47,955 --> 00:08:49,815
Where I live, that's your home.

159
00:08:49,815 --> 00:08:51,095
But I don't have the surname Guan or Meng.

160
00:08:51,095 --> 00:08:52,155
What your surname is doesn't matter.

161
00:08:52,155 --> 00:08:53,874
You must live here.
You're not allowed to go anywhere else.

162
00:08:54,912 --> 00:08:57,235
When you were with my mom,
you started to be a kept man.

163
00:08:57,235 --> 00:08:59,434
You're just used to mooching off others.

164
00:08:59,434 --> 00:09:00,864
I don't want to follow you.

165
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,035
You're going too far.

166
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:10,555
- You're too disrespectful.
- Yes.

167
00:09:11,328 --> 00:09:12,435
I'm disrespectful.

168
00:09:13,035 --> 00:09:14,995
That's because you've never disciplined me.

169
00:09:14,995 --> 00:09:16,795
- You're talking back again.
- Enough.

170
00:09:24,435 --> 00:09:25,975
I agreed to her living at school

171
00:09:25,975 --> 00:09:27,072
and signed.

172
00:09:27,072 --> 00:09:28,835
We had a fight before,
and our relationship wasn't good,

173
00:09:28,835 --> 00:09:30,112
so when she said she wanted to live at school,

174
00:09:30,112 --> 00:09:31,655
I signed for her.

175
00:09:31,655 --> 00:09:33,155
Your quarrels give me a headache.

176
00:09:36,594 --> 00:09:37,600
Lin Yujing,

177
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,714
don't you have things to do at school?
Get going now.

178
00:09:41,536 --> 00:09:43,155
Stop, Lin…

179
00:10:39,114 --> 00:10:40,514
What are you doing sitting here alone?

180
00:10:44,736 --> 00:10:46,155
What happened to your face?

181
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:49,795
Who hit you?

182
00:10:51,584 --> 00:10:52,915
Let's have a fight.

183
00:10:55,275 --> 00:10:56,694
I'm very unhappy right now.

184
00:10:56,694 --> 00:10:58,035
Let's have a fight, just the two of us.

185
00:11:03,776 --> 00:11:04,928
I just want to fight someone.

186
00:11:04,928 --> 00:11:05,955
Will you fight with me or not?

187
00:11:05,955 --> 00:11:07,315
If you don't, I'll find someone else.

188
00:11:10,915 --> 00:11:12,494
Fight. No problem. I'll fight with you.

189
00:11:12,494 --> 00:11:13,514
Fight any way you want.

190
00:11:14,784 --> 00:11:16,315
B-B-But can you

191
00:11:17,504 --> 00:11:18,560
not cry?

192
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,594
Eat.

193
00:11:43,072 --> 00:11:44,715
Why didn't you dodge?

194
00:11:44,715 --> 00:11:46,234
I couldn't dodge it.

195
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,120
Does it hurt?

196
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,634
It's okay. I don't feel much.

197
00:11:55,488 --> 00:11:57,395
You're like this and still don't feel it?

198
00:12:00,874 --> 00:12:02,714
It does affect your looks a bit.

199
00:12:03,315 --> 00:12:04,474
Let me put a band-aid on for you.

200
00:12:06,195 --> 00:12:07,294
For this wound of mine,

201
00:12:07,294 --> 00:12:09,555
you'd have to line up three of them
to cover it.

202
00:12:11,075 --> 00:12:12,255
I see a pharmacy ahead.

203
00:12:12,255 --> 00:12:13,395
How about I buy you a roll of gauze

204
00:12:13,395 --> 00:12:14,755
and wrap it around your head?

205
00:12:14,755 --> 00:12:17,408
You'll look like a tough guy
with a story, pretty fierce.

206
00:12:17,408 --> 00:12:18,915
Okay, that's enough.

207
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:20,768
Eat now.

208
00:12:21,312 --> 00:12:22,752
I'm already pretty fierce.

209
00:12:45,504 --> 00:12:46,675
Do you think

210
00:12:47,634 --> 00:12:49,855
this city is too dark?

211
00:12:49,855 --> 00:12:51,675
There's not a single star.

212
00:13:16,608 --> 00:13:17,974
How about this?

213
00:13:17,974 --> 00:13:19,335
I'll punch you too.

214
00:13:19,335 --> 00:13:20,934
You'll see stars right away.

215
00:13:20,934 --> 00:13:22,080
How about it?

216
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,114
I'm going back.

217
00:13:49,114 --> 00:13:51,435
Thanks for today.

218
00:13:52,736 --> 00:13:53,994
Have a good rest.

219
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,035
Lin Yujing,

220
00:14:00,994 --> 00:14:02,075
Um,

221
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,315
tomorrow,

222
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:06,944
do you want to go out and play together?

223
00:14:06,944 --> 00:14:08,160
Where to play?

224
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,554
I-I-I haven't decided yet.

225
00:14:09,554 --> 00:14:10,574
I'll let you know when it's decided.

226
00:14:10,574 --> 00:14:12,435
How about we invite Xu Ruyi to join us?

227
00:14:12,992 --> 00:14:14,048
No problem.

228
00:14:14,675 --> 00:14:16,195
Then I'll go back, bye.

229
00:14:17,024 --> 00:14:18,048
Bye.

230
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:31,955
Hey, He Songnan.

231
00:14:32,795 --> 00:14:34,234
I have something to discuss with you.

232
00:14:39,315 --> 00:14:40,914
I talked to Shen Juan.

233
00:14:40,914 --> 00:14:42,354
We're going out to play tomorrow.

234
00:14:43,114 --> 00:14:45,554
Then s-s-should I go?

235
00:14:45,554 --> 00:14:46,595
What's wrong with it?

236
00:14:46,595 --> 00:14:47,675
It's better to have everyone together.

237
00:14:49,514 --> 00:14:51,795
Okay, then I'll go with you.

238
00:14:57,275 --> 00:14:58,674
It's settled.

239
00:14:58,674 --> 00:14:59,855
We decided to go to the farm

240
00:14:59,855 --> 00:15:01,440
<i>and plan to stay for two days and one night.</i>

241
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,095
<i>Pack your stuff.</i>

242
00:15:03,095 --> 00:15:04,435
<i>I'll pick you up early tomorrow.</i>

243
00:15:05,035 --> 00:15:07,895
Okay. See you tomorrow, bye.

244
00:15:07,895 --> 00:15:08,955
<i>See you tomorrow.</i>

245
00:15:12,195 --> 00:15:13,995
Shen Juan said we'd go to the farm tomorrow

246
00:15:13,995 --> 00:15:15,475
and stay there for two days and one night.

247
00:15:15,475 --> 00:15:16,714
Farm?

248
00:15:16,714 --> 00:15:18,315
I've never been to a farm.

249
00:15:18,315 --> 00:15:19,514
Me neither.

250
00:15:30,432 --> 00:15:31,488
<i>Cuihua.</i>

251
00:15:32,874 --> 00:15:33,955
<i>Tiezhu.</i>

252
00:15:33,955 --> 00:15:35,755
<i>You've raised these geese quite well.</i>

253
00:15:35,755 --> 00:15:36,995
<i>You're not bad at raising cattle, too.</i>

254
00:15:36,995 --> 00:15:39,475
<i>Can I have a couple for the New Year?</i>

255
00:15:39,475 --> 00:15:40,544
<i>Sure thing.</i>

256
00:15:51,616 --> 00:15:52,754
Lin Yujing.

257
00:16:00,675 --> 00:16:02,354
<i>I'm downstairs at your dorm.</i>

258
00:16:02,944 --> 00:16:04,000
Okay.

259
00:16:14,528 --> 00:16:15,714
Why are you here?

260
00:16:17,664 --> 00:16:19,474
My mom asked me to bring you some oranges.

261
00:16:20,672 --> 00:16:21,760
Thanks.

262
00:16:22,395 --> 00:16:24,555
What's going on with you and your dad?

263
00:16:25,435 --> 00:16:26,915
Just what you saw.

264
00:16:28,416 --> 00:16:29,874
Does he often hit you like this?

265
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,234
This is the first time.

266
00:16:33,795 --> 00:16:36,555
Before, he didn't pay much attention to me.

267
00:16:43,616 --> 00:16:45,315
Just now, I wasn't helping you.

268
00:16:45,315 --> 00:16:47,075
I just couldn't stand him hitting you.

269
00:16:49,114 --> 00:16:51,114
I see. Thank you, Mingxiu.

270
00:16:54,432 --> 00:16:56,695
Can you not use such a disgusting tone

271
00:16:56,695 --> 00:16:57,995
when you talk to me?

272
00:16:57,995 --> 00:16:59,635
This time, I'm sincere.

273
00:17:03,474 --> 00:17:05,074
Where are you going
if you don't go home this holiday?

274
00:17:06,074 --> 00:17:07,374
Probably going out with classmates.

275
00:17:07,374 --> 00:17:08,915
Where to and for how long?

276
00:17:09,675 --> 00:17:11,395
To a farm, for two days and one night.

277
00:17:11,395 --> 00:17:12,794
Going so far and staying overnight?

278
00:17:13,568 --> 00:17:15,634
Wait, you guys are
all underage high school students.

279
00:17:15,634 --> 00:17:16,896
How can you go without an adult?

280
00:17:16,896 --> 00:17:17,920
Can you guarantee safety?

281
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:19,835
Then, why don't you come with us?

282
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,274
I have to look at my schedule.

283
00:17:24,274 --> 00:17:25,355
I may not have time.

284
00:17:26,835 --> 00:17:28,755
We rarely get to go out.

285
00:17:28,755 --> 00:17:30,274
And the car hasn't been booked yet.

286
00:17:30,274 --> 00:17:31,635
Could you drive us?

287
00:17:34,675 --> 00:17:37,760
Well, then, I'll reluctantly agree

288
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,875
to be your guardian.

289
00:17:40,384 --> 00:17:41,595
But just to say upfront,

290
00:17:42,176 --> 00:17:43,715
you guys don't go too wild.

291
00:17:43,715 --> 00:17:44,915
Early to bed, early to rise, got it?

292
00:17:44,915 --> 00:17:47,074
Don't worry. You're there, aren't you?

293
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:50,554
I'm going back now.

294
00:17:51,392 --> 00:17:52,448
Bye.

295
00:17:53,024 --> 00:17:54,314
I'll come to pick you up tomorrow.

296
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:07,616
Shen Juan,

297
00:18:09,635 --> 00:18:11,714
let me introduce you.
This is my good friend Xu Ruyi.

298
00:18:12,234 --> 00:18:13,675
This is Shen Juan's friend He Songnan.

299
00:18:13,675 --> 00:18:14,795
He's from our school too.

300
00:18:14,795 --> 00:18:16,128
Hello.

301
00:18:16,704 --> 00:18:17,824
Hello, junior sister.

302
00:18:20,034 --> 00:18:21,875
Did you say you booked a car?

303
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:23,794
It should be arriving soon.

304
00:18:24,608 --> 00:18:25,664
It's here.

305
00:18:36,595 --> 00:18:38,848
How's that? I arrived just in time, right?

306
00:18:38,848 --> 00:18:40,195
Right on time.

307
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,335
These are my classmates.

308
00:18:43,335 --> 00:18:44,435
This is my brother.

309
00:18:46,752 --> 00:18:48,675
Hello, my name is Shen Juan.

310
00:18:50,496 --> 00:18:51,872
Hello, Mr. Lin.

311
00:18:51,872 --> 00:18:53,274
My brother's surname is Fu.

312
00:18:54,848 --> 00:18:56,288
Let's go. Get in the car.

313
00:18:57,088 --> 00:18:58,112
Let's go.

314
00:18:58,112 --> 00:18:59,395
Junior sister, let me help you with your bag.

315
00:19:07,595 --> 00:19:09,888
Lin Yujing, you think I'm your chauffeur?

316
00:19:09,888 --> 00:19:10,976
Come sit in the front.

317
00:19:31,872 --> 00:19:32,875
Thanks.

318
00:19:33,792 --> 00:19:34,848
Thanks.

319
00:19:35,904 --> 00:19:37,395
Try it. It's sweet.

320
00:19:38,208 --> 00:19:39,435
You can't eat.

321
00:19:42,272 --> 00:19:43,395
I don't know the way.

322
00:19:43,395 --> 00:19:44,695
You have to remind me how to go.

323
00:19:44,695 --> 00:19:46,195
Eating is distracting.

324
00:19:46,835 --> 00:19:48,395
Don't you have a navigation app on your phone?

325
00:19:49,835 --> 00:19:51,794
It is prone to errors.

326
00:19:54,514 --> 00:19:56,714
Alright, I'll keep an eye out for you.

327
00:20:06,144 --> 00:20:07,695
Up ahead, we're going to get on the freeway.

328
00:20:07,695 --> 00:20:08,736
Change lanes in advance.

329
00:20:27,474 --> 00:20:28,994
Here we are.

330
00:20:34,528 --> 00:20:36,352
Isn't the scenery here nice?

331
00:20:36,352 --> 00:20:37,474
Not bad.

332
00:20:41,312 --> 00:20:43,552
This is not quite like the farm I imagined.

333
00:20:43,552 --> 00:20:45,335
What did you imagine?

334
00:20:45,335 --> 00:20:47,494
I thought I would be carrying a hoe,
wearing a headscarf

335
00:20:47,494 --> 00:20:48,775
and have mud all over my face and body.

336
00:20:48,775 --> 00:20:49,915
It's good I brought you here this time.

337
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:52,195
To show you
what an eco-friendly, new-age farm looks like.

338
00:20:53,635 --> 00:20:54,635
Let's walk that way.

339
00:20:57,115 --> 00:20:58,315
How come you have the keys here?

340
00:20:58,315 --> 00:20:59,654
Don't tell me it's opened by your family.

341
00:20:59,654 --> 00:21:00,655
It really is my family's.

342
00:21:00,655 --> 00:21:01,728
It's run by my parents.

343
00:21:01,728 --> 00:21:03,554
Here, the girls' room.

344
00:21:04,355 --> 00:21:06,714
Not bad. He Songnan, you're quite low-key.

345
00:21:07,395 --> 00:21:09,455
I've never had a holiday out here.

346
00:21:09,455 --> 00:21:10,875
This place is really good.

347
00:21:10,875 --> 00:21:12,075
It must have been hard
to book for the National Day.

348
00:21:12,075 --> 00:21:13,335
Thanks to you.

349
00:21:13,335 --> 00:21:14,915
You should say thank you to Juan.

350
00:21:16,794 --> 00:21:18,656
He wanted to bring everyone out for fun,

351
00:21:18,656 --> 00:21:19,715
to see the scenery

352
00:21:19,715 --> 00:21:21,754
and to relax, and he thought of this place.

353
00:21:21,754 --> 00:21:23,595
Are you feeling pretty good?

354
00:21:24,435 --> 00:21:26,134
I've put away your things for you.

355
00:21:26,134 --> 00:21:28,374
There are a lot of recreational facilities here
to play with.

356
00:21:28,374 --> 00:21:30,144
Put down your luggage, clean up a bit
and then we'll go play.

357
00:21:30,144 --> 00:21:31,235
Okay.

358
00:21:31,235 --> 00:21:32,714
Let's go to your rooms.

359
00:21:42,624 --> 00:21:45,115
Mom, don't worry about me.

360
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,714
I just came to a farm with friends,

361
00:21:52,384 --> 00:21:54,055
and I miss home now.

362
00:21:54,055 --> 00:21:55,395
Don't worry about me.

363
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,074
Bye.

364
00:22:03,648 --> 00:22:04,794
Senior.

365
00:22:07,968 --> 00:22:10,752
The temperature here
drops quite a bit at night.

366
00:22:10,752 --> 00:22:12,074
I'm here to bring you a blanket.

367
00:22:13,408 --> 00:22:14,656
Thank you.

368
00:22:18,074 --> 00:22:19,675
They've all gone out to play.

369
00:22:20,195 --> 00:22:22,274
How about I show you around?

370
00:22:24,864 --> 00:22:26,474
- Okay.
- Okay.

371
00:22:29,696 --> 00:22:30,875
Hello.

372
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,635
Can the two of you cheer up a bit?

373
00:22:34,435 --> 00:22:35,456
Shen Juan.

374
00:22:36,832 --> 00:22:37,975
Mingxiu,

375
00:22:37,975 --> 00:22:39,754
can you stop playing with your phone?

376
00:22:40,864 --> 00:22:42,304
You both take a picture together.

377
00:22:42,816 --> 00:22:44,595
Take a photo. Come on.

378
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,168
Three, two, one.

379
00:22:47,168 --> 00:22:48,274
Smile.

380
00:22:54,272 --> 00:22:55,634
You two look at each other.

381
00:22:55,634 --> 00:22:56,675
Take another one.

382
00:22:58,944 --> 00:23:00,495
Three, two, one.

383
00:23:00,495 --> 00:23:01,504
Eye contact.

384
00:23:03,904 --> 00:23:05,024
Excuse me.

385
00:23:05,024 --> 00:23:06,475
Mum, higher.

386
00:23:06,475 --> 00:23:07,520
Fun, right?

387
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:09,568
Yes.

388
00:23:10,784 --> 00:23:11,915
Even higher.

389
00:23:11,915 --> 00:23:12,928
Okay.

390
00:23:43,904 --> 00:23:44,994
Excuse me.

391
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:48,800
Let's continue.

392
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:50,994
Okay.

393
00:23:52,288 --> 00:23:54,575
Wait. Stop.

394
00:23:54,575 --> 00:23:55,994
Who'd stop as you say?

395
00:24:08,704 --> 00:24:10,034
Sorry, Mingxiu.

396
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:14,816
It doesn't stack like that. Let me do it.

397
00:25:15,392 --> 00:25:17,735
You need to find some sticks of similar length.

398
00:25:17,735 --> 00:25:19,195
And then stack them up.

399
00:25:19,195 --> 00:25:22,115
It will form a very stable cone.

400
00:25:22,115 --> 00:25:23,475
These gaps in the middle

401
00:25:23,475 --> 00:25:25,414
will allow the air to circulate better.

402
00:25:25,414 --> 00:25:27,794
This way, it helps to burn fully.

403
00:25:35,386 --> 00:25:38,010
<i>[Dr. Gu]</i>

404
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,554
Shen Juan, you got a call.

405
00:25:54,272 --> 00:25:55,815
Do you know how to do it?

406
00:25:55,815 --> 00:25:56,864
I'll help you.

407
00:26:04,352 --> 00:26:05,355
Come on.

408
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,315
Be careful.

409
00:26:36,315 --> 00:26:37,675
They peck very painfully.

410
00:26:45,216 --> 00:26:46,675
You know how to feed geese?

411
00:26:47,328 --> 00:26:48,575
When I was a kid,
my family lived in the countryside,

412
00:26:48,575 --> 00:26:49,755
and we raised geese.

413
00:26:49,755 --> 00:26:51,074
This is the feed we used.

414
00:26:53,274 --> 00:26:55,274
You used to live in the countryside too?

415
00:26:56,992 --> 00:26:59,354
I remember when I was little, every summer,

416
00:26:59,354 --> 00:27:01,195
I would often sneak out
in the middle of the night

417
00:27:01,195 --> 00:27:03,675
and lie down in the feed shack.

418
00:27:04,608 --> 00:27:07,535
There was a hole in its roof,

419
00:27:07,535 --> 00:27:09,195
through which I could see the moon.

420
00:27:10,635 --> 00:27:13,215
When I was a kid, my family had a hut too.

421
00:27:13,215 --> 00:27:14,714
And there was a hole in the roof too.

422
00:27:15,776 --> 00:27:16,994
Could you see the moon too?

423
00:27:21,184 --> 00:27:22,304
I'll do it this time.

424
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,135
Can you do it?

425
00:27:24,135 --> 00:27:25,875
Sure. Give me.

426
00:27:28,992 --> 00:27:30,495
It's simple.

427
00:27:30,495 --> 00:27:31,714
We're back.

428
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:33,792
You're back.

429
00:27:33,792 --> 00:27:35,136
We bought a lot of food.

430
00:27:35,136 --> 00:27:36,554
So much.

431
00:27:38,336 --> 00:27:39,455
Do we take it out?

432
00:27:39,455 --> 00:27:40,512
Let's spread it out.

433
00:28:00,064 --> 00:28:01,195
Let me do it.

434
00:28:13,435 --> 00:28:15,355
After setting it up like this,

435
00:28:15,355 --> 00:28:16,714
the fire is quite vigorous.

436
00:28:18,074 --> 00:28:19,615
My dad taught me before.

437
00:28:19,615 --> 00:28:21,314
I haven't done it for a long time.

438
00:28:29,152 --> 00:28:30,304
Wipe your sweat.

439
00:28:31,232 --> 00:28:32,355
Thanks.

440
00:28:32,355 --> 00:28:33,434
Thanks.

441
00:28:33,434 --> 00:28:35,115
You two work well together.

442
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:46,675
You signed her boarding school application,
right?

443
00:28:50,176 --> 00:28:52,234
Do you know she got beaten because of that?

444
00:28:56,195 --> 00:28:57,615
I ran into her yesterday.

445
00:28:57,615 --> 00:28:59,055
She didn't tell me,

446
00:28:59,055 --> 00:29:00,314
but I guessed it.

447
00:29:05,696 --> 00:29:06,752
I'm sorry.

448
00:29:09,714 --> 00:29:11,115
Actually, the person who should apologize

449
00:29:12,794 --> 00:29:13,994
is me.

450
00:29:15,955 --> 00:29:17,875
She and I are not real siblings. Do you know?

451
00:29:19,776 --> 00:29:21,795
She has never treated me as a brother.

452
00:29:21,795 --> 00:29:23,595
And I have never treated her as a sister.

453
00:29:27,744 --> 00:29:30,595
Until yesterday when I saw her being beaten.

454
00:29:30,595 --> 00:29:32,994
For the first time,
I felt like I was her brother.

455
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,034
But I'm not a competent brother.

456
00:29:38,835 --> 00:29:40,754
That day she asked me to sign for her.

457
00:29:41,504 --> 00:29:43,552
She wanted to escape from our terrible home.

458
00:29:44,064 --> 00:29:45,274
I didn't agree to help her.

459
00:29:46,595 --> 00:29:47,835
It's good that you helped her.

460
00:29:52,034 --> 00:29:54,514
You specially arranged this trip
for her, right?

461
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,595
Shen Juan,

462
00:30:06,195 --> 00:30:09,152
as her brother, I lack experience.

463
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:11,395
I'm glad she has friends like you.

464
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,144
Thank you.

465
00:30:19,955 --> 00:30:21,135
What are you two talking about?

466
00:30:21,135 --> 00:30:22,336
Come over and eat.

467
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:26,912
Let's go.

468
00:30:38,656 --> 00:30:39,776
You.

469
00:30:40,864 --> 00:30:41,888
I…

470
00:30:42,635 --> 00:30:44,255
don't know how to play truth or dare.

471
00:30:44,255 --> 00:30:45,664
It's just a very simple game.

472
00:30:45,664 --> 00:30:46,754
Pick one at random.

473
00:30:46,754 --> 00:30:48,274
You'll get it after one round.

474
00:30:49,792 --> 00:30:52,195
Then I choose truth.

475
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,395
Alright, let me ask.

476
00:30:55,435 --> 00:30:57,155
What's the happiest thing for you?

477
00:30:58,234 --> 00:30:59,495
The happiest thing

478
00:30:59,495 --> 00:31:01,755
is hanging out with you guys today.

479
00:31:01,755 --> 00:31:02,935
Yeah, it's so fun.

480
00:31:02,935 --> 00:31:03,955
Come on, next.

481
00:31:04,875 --> 00:31:06,235
We haven't even asked yet.

482
00:31:06,235 --> 00:31:07,595
You're letting her off too easy.

483
00:31:10,112 --> 00:31:11,635
L-L-Let me drink one for her.

484
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:13,314
Hold on.

485
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:17,034
How can you drink this?

486
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:19,584
So cruel.

487
00:31:19,584 --> 00:31:20,875
Juan, what's going on with you?

488
00:31:20,875 --> 00:31:22,355
Drink a lot.

489
00:31:23,274 --> 00:31:24,714
Bottoms up, you have to finish it.

490
00:31:27,232 --> 00:31:28,234
Let's applaud you.

491
00:31:29,216 --> 00:31:30,715
Good.

492
00:31:30,715 --> 00:31:32,015
Next one.

493
00:31:32,015 --> 00:31:33,184
Come on.

494
00:31:33,184 --> 00:31:34,272
Go.

495
00:31:37,952 --> 00:31:40,128
You, truth or dare?

496
00:31:40,128 --> 00:31:41,175
Dare.

497
00:31:41,175 --> 00:31:42,208
I'll drink that beverage.

498
00:31:42,208 --> 00:31:44,075
No, you're an adult.

499
00:31:44,075 --> 00:31:45,514
Of course, you have to drink alcohol.

500
00:31:46,176 --> 00:31:47,474
You have to drink half.

501
00:31:48,032 --> 00:31:50,208
- An adult should drink like an adult.
- Exactly.

502
00:31:50,208 --> 00:31:51,395
Drink a lot, Mingxiu.

503
00:31:52,875 --> 00:31:54,155
- Good.
- Come on, continue.

504
00:31:56,274 --> 00:31:57,632
I choose dare.

505
00:31:57,632 --> 00:31:58,720
Juan,

506
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:01,195
you think of one for her.

507
00:32:02,714 --> 00:32:04,115
Then…

508
00:32:06,144 --> 00:32:07,435
take a sip of the beverage.

509
00:32:10,208 --> 00:32:11,595
Compared to Juan,

510
00:32:11,595 --> 00:32:13,875
I was not going easy on her, right?

511
00:32:15,034 --> 00:32:16,234
Next one.

512
00:32:17,216 --> 00:32:18,335
Alright.

513
00:32:18,335 --> 00:32:19,395
Come on, let's drink together.

514
00:32:19,395 --> 00:32:20,675
Cheers.

515
00:32:21,435 --> 00:32:23,008
Come on, let's all drink.

516
00:32:23,008 --> 00:32:24,155
Bottoms up.

517
00:32:47,936 --> 00:32:48,995
It's still you.

518
00:32:48,995 --> 00:32:50,315
No, you drank the wrong one.

519
00:32:50,315 --> 00:32:51,635
This one contains alcohol.

520
00:32:52,768 --> 00:32:54,144
You don't. Stop drinking.

521
00:32:54,144 --> 00:32:55,274
Stop drinking.

522
00:32:55,776 --> 00:32:57,600
Why is it never your turn?

523
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,635
Wait.

524
00:33:01,568 --> 00:33:03,055
It's your turn. Choose.

525
00:33:03,055 --> 00:33:04,192
Juan, it's your turn.

526
00:33:04,192 --> 00:33:05,474
Let me do it.

527
00:33:06,112 --> 00:33:07,274
Truth.

528
00:33:08,288 --> 00:33:09,474
Lin Yujing,

529
00:33:10,835 --> 00:33:14,595
do you really dislike me a lot?

530
00:33:17,632 --> 00:33:18,688
Yes.

531
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:21,234
Then do you really dislike me too?

532
00:33:23,712 --> 00:33:24,835
No.

533
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:28,512
Liar, drink.

534
00:33:28,512 --> 00:33:29,536
Drink now.

535
00:33:29,536 --> 00:33:30,595
I told the truth.

536
00:33:30,595 --> 00:33:32,514
Why do I have to drink?

537
00:33:33,152 --> 00:33:34,475
What am I drinking for?

538
00:33:34,475 --> 00:33:36,416
You clearly really dislike me.

539
00:33:36,416 --> 00:33:37,514
What are you even saying?

540
00:33:37,514 --> 00:33:39,616
If I disliked you, I wouldn't be here with you.

541
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:41,835
I wouldn't be here with you at all.

542
00:33:41,835 --> 00:33:44,235
If you can't drink, then don't.

543
00:33:44,235 --> 00:33:45,395
You.

544
00:33:46,624 --> 00:33:48,915
Juan, should we take him back first?

545
00:33:53,274 --> 00:33:54,794
It's okay.

546
00:33:57,234 --> 00:33:58,875
I'm not drunk.

547
00:33:58,875 --> 00:34:00,875
Y-Y-You haven't told the truth.

548
00:34:00,875 --> 00:34:02,395
You can't leave.

549
00:34:02,395 --> 00:34:03,515
Too drunk.

550
00:34:03,515 --> 00:34:04,554
I can still drink.

551
00:34:04,554 --> 00:34:06,144
Take his phone and key.

552
00:34:06,144 --> 00:34:08,800
- Alright.
- Just a couple of sips.

553
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:09,824
We'll be back soon.

554
00:34:09,824 --> 00:34:10,848
Alright.

555
00:34:12,355 --> 00:34:14,395
You haven't said your true words yet.

556
00:34:57,952 --> 00:34:59,168
Honey water.

557
00:35:05,554 --> 00:35:06,875
Did I drink too much?

558
00:35:06,875 --> 00:35:08,074
Where are they?

559
00:35:09,114 --> 00:35:10,354
Your brother drank too much too.

560
00:35:10,354 --> 00:35:12,654
You two just asked each other

561
00:35:12,654 --> 00:35:14,474
over ten times whether you dislike each other.

562
00:35:16,315 --> 00:35:17,994
It was so embarrassing.

563
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:25,594
Is your head still dizzy?

564
00:35:29,536 --> 00:35:31,074
I'll take you somewhere. Let's go.

565
00:35:37,355 --> 00:35:39,215
This place is so dark.

566
00:35:39,215 --> 00:35:40,395
Where are we going?

567
00:35:42,656 --> 00:35:43,955
Just follow me.

568
00:35:51,552 --> 00:35:52,608
We've arrived.

569
00:35:56,074 --> 00:35:57,355
What is this?

570
00:35:58,240 --> 00:35:59,554
It should be about right.

571
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:02,715
Five, four,

572
00:36:03,296 --> 00:36:05,275
three, two,

573
00:36:06,048 --> 00:36:07,104
one.

574
00:36:14,634 --> 00:36:16,455
No, it shouldn't be. What's going on?

575
00:36:16,455 --> 00:36:17,594
Isn't it…?

576
00:36:18,464 --> 00:36:19,795
Isn't it time yet?

577
00:36:48,594 --> 00:36:49,795
It's so beautiful.

578
00:36:51,872 --> 00:36:53,114
You said before

579
00:36:54,144 --> 00:36:55,915
there were no stars in this city.

580
00:36:58,272 --> 00:36:59,514
But I know

581
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:01,715
the stars here are the brightest.

582
00:37:07,392 --> 00:37:10,368
The stars here light up every night
at eight o'clock on the dot.

583
00:37:10,976 --> 00:37:12,715
So we came quite on time.

584
00:37:14,994 --> 00:37:16,735
I hit you before.

585
00:37:16,735 --> 00:37:18,194
And you still brought me to see the stars.

586
00:37:19,072 --> 00:37:22,235
With you saying this,
my head starts to hurt again.

587
00:37:25,472 --> 00:37:26,674
I'm sorry.

588
00:37:27,616 --> 00:37:29,594
I was in a bad mood that day.

589
00:37:30,275 --> 00:37:31,755
Something happened at home.

590
00:37:32,928 --> 00:37:35,104
I wanted to live in the school dormitory,
but my dad wouldn't let me.

591
00:37:35,616 --> 00:37:36,736
So I came to you for your signature.

592
00:37:36,736 --> 00:37:37,760
I know.

593
00:37:41,824 --> 00:37:43,235
But next time,

594
00:37:43,235 --> 00:37:44,715
before you hit me,

595
00:37:46,048 --> 00:37:47,795
could you let me be ready for it?

596
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:01,056
Shen Juan,

597
00:38:02,496 --> 00:38:04,875
I've told you my secret.

598
00:38:06,016 --> 00:38:07,034
Then,

599
00:38:08,994 --> 00:38:10,275
what about your secrets?

600
00:38:36,064 --> 00:38:37,114
<i>Are you awake?</i>

601
00:38:38,795 --> 00:38:39,915
<i>I'm waiting outside.</i>

602
00:38:53,632 --> 00:38:56,114
What did you call me out so early for?

603
00:38:56,864 --> 00:38:58,674
Did you forget what you asked me yesterday?

604
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:04,474
It's okay.

605
00:39:05,088 --> 00:39:06,176
I'll take you.

606
00:39:17,312 --> 00:39:18,994
Why did you bring me here?

607
00:39:20,992 --> 00:39:22,795
Don't you want to know my secret?

608
00:39:24,355 --> 00:39:25,695
Since it's a secret,

609
00:39:25,695 --> 00:39:27,194
maybe it's better not to know.

610
00:39:48,224 --> 00:39:49,675
This is my uncle.

611
00:39:49,675 --> 00:39:50,994
His name is Luo Qinghe.

612
00:39:52,194 --> 00:39:53,715
He's the real owner of the silver shop.

613
00:39:55,776 --> 00:39:57,995
Uncle, this is Lin Yujing.

614
00:39:57,995 --> 00:39:59,275
She's my desk mate.

615
00:39:59,275 --> 00:40:01,935
The girl I told you before,
who protected our shop.

616
00:40:01,935 --> 00:40:03,136
I brought her to see you.

617
00:40:03,136 --> 00:40:04,154
Your uncle--

618
00:40:04,154 --> 00:40:06,315
He's been lying here for a long time.

619
00:40:07,435 --> 00:40:10,875
The doctor said the chances of him waking up
are less than ten percent.

620
00:40:12,384 --> 00:40:13,835
But I just don't believe it.

621
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:16,275
I believe as long as I talk to him every day,

622
00:40:16,832 --> 00:40:18,315
he will wake up.

623
00:40:22,114 --> 00:40:25,088
So all your previous tardiness and leaves

624
00:40:25,088 --> 00:40:26,464
were all to take care of your uncle.

625
00:40:26,464 --> 00:40:27,712
Correct.

626
00:40:27,712 --> 00:40:29,856
I was raised by my uncle.

627
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:33,634
So whenever I have time, I come to see him.

628
00:40:43,474 --> 00:40:46,094
<i>Sorry, this is a display item.
It's not for sale.</i>

629
00:40:46,094 --> 00:40:47,415
<i>Actually, I'm a bit curious.</i>

630
00:40:47,415 --> 00:40:49,514
<i>Why can't the items
in the display case be sold?</i>

631
00:40:50,336 --> 00:40:51,552
<i>You don't need to know about that.</i>

632
00:40:51,552 --> 00:40:52,594
<i>How about this?</i>

633
00:40:53,376 --> 00:40:55,936
<i>I'll melt down the pieces I made before.</i>

634
00:40:55,936 --> 00:40:56,994
<i>Juan,</i>

635
00:40:58,368 --> 00:40:59,594
<i>are you sure?</i>

636
00:41:03,104 --> 00:41:05,574
<i>You stay up late at night
working for this shop,</i>

637
00:41:05,574 --> 00:41:07,456
<i>arrive late to school and sleep in class.</i>

638
00:41:07,456 --> 00:41:08,480
<i>Shen Juan,</i>

639
00:41:09,312 --> 00:41:10,795
<i>you're still a child.</i>

640
00:41:11,315 --> 00:41:12,474
<i>Don't carry such a heavy burden</i>

641
00:41:12,474 --> 00:41:14,034
<i>on yourself.</i>

642
00:41:18,848 --> 00:41:21,856
Do you remember the dragon fruit garden
I took you to yesterday?

643
00:41:28,256 --> 00:41:29,664
My uncle took me there too

644
00:41:31,456 --> 00:41:32,875
after my mom passed away.

645
00:41:38,944 --> 00:41:40,154
He told me

646
00:41:42,112 --> 00:41:44,634
my mom became a star in the sky to be with me.

647
00:41:47,008 --> 00:41:48,474
But after people die,

648
00:41:49,056 --> 00:41:50,594
how can they become stars?

649
00:41:52,608 --> 00:41:55,074
He was just comforting me.

650
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:10,656
But when the starry sea lights up--

651
00:42:10,656 --> 00:42:12,835
It seems like all the gloom can be dispelled.

652
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:32,192
<i>That night, when the starry sea lit up
before my eyes,</i>

653
00:42:32,192 --> 00:42:34,720
<i>you looked at me with clear eyes,</i>

654
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:37,888
<i>as if a gentle light penetrated the gloom,</i>

655
00:42:37,888 --> 00:42:39,334
<i>scattering and falling onto my heart.</i>

656
00:42:39,334 --> 00:42:41,495
<i>There're words
I've been hiding in my heart for a long time.</i>

657
00:42:41,495 --> 00:42:42,560
<i>I want to tell you.</i>

658
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:45,056
<i>It's you who drove away the loneliness
in my heart</i>

659
00:42:45,056 --> 00:42:46,688
<i>and lit up the entire night sky.</i>

660
00:42:59,290 --> 00:43:03,834
<i>♫ Love sprouts in my palm ♫</i>

661
00:43:05,146 --> 00:43:08,986
<i>♫ Yet worried linger within my eyes ♫</i>

662
00:43:10,778 --> 00:43:15,354
<i>♫ Our story hasn't ended ♫</i>

663
00:43:16,282 --> 00:43:19,962
<i>♫ So where are we now ♫</i>

664
00:43:21,786 --> 00:43:27,450
<i>♫ I want to hug you so badly ♫</i>

665
00:43:27,450 --> 00:43:31,514
<i>♫ I want to become better with you ♫</i>

666
00:43:32,762 --> 00:43:37,626
<i>♫ The youth we shared ♫</i>

667
00:43:37,626 --> 00:43:43,674
<i>♫ Turned into a rainbow within my heart ♫</i>

668
00:43:44,186 --> 00:43:49,754
<i>♫ I really want to warm you ♫</i>

669
00:43:49,754 --> 00:43:51,642
<i>♫ I want to share with you ♫</i>

670
00:43:51,642 --> 00:43:56,314
<i>♫ The beauty of the world ♫</i>

671
00:43:57,198 --> 00:43:59,418
<i>♫ We promised ♫</i>

672
00:43:59,994 --> 00:44:05,690
<i>♫ To never be apart ♫</i>

673
00:44:06,426 --> 00:44:12,128
<i>♫ Do you want to hear me sing ♫</i>

674
00:44:12,128 --> 00:44:16,890
<i>♫ The wind chime swaying in my heart ♫</i>

675
00:44:17,434 --> 00:44:21,658
<i>♫ Is a wish ♫</i>

676
00:44:22,394 --> 00:44:28,282
<i>♫ I secretly made for you ♫</i>

677
00:44:28,826 --> 00:44:34,362
<i>♫ I want to plant ♫</i>

678
00:44:34,362 --> 00:44:36,250
<i>♫ A red maple forest ♫</i>

679
00:44:36,250 --> 00:44:40,858
<i>♫ To dye the whole mountain red ♫</i>

680
00:44:41,786 --> 00:44:44,026
<i>♫ The sky after the rain ♫</i>

681
00:44:44,666 --> 00:44:49,594
<i>♫ Was painted by our brilliant dreams ♫</i>

682
00:44:56,474 --> 00:45:01,242
<i>♫ Time is a flower of dream ♫</i>

683
00:45:02,074 --> 00:45:07,160
<i>♫ You've already collected it ♫</i>

684
00:45:08,090 --> 00:45:12,090
<i>♫ When we all become better ♫</i>

685
00:45:13,562 --> 00:45:17,690
<i>♫ We'll see the best of the world together ♫</i>
