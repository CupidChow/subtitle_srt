Can you sit with me for a while?

21
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:07,350
I've given my uncle's manuscripts

22
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:08,512
and his shop

23
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,790
to Nie Xinghe.

24
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:14,149
That was my uncle's wish.

25
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:17,510
I learned it from Zhou Hang.

26
00:02:21,389 --> 00:02:23,550
Nie Xinghe must not have thought

27
00:02:24,189 --> 00:02:26,510
he had misunderstood your uncle a lot.

28
00:02:30,389 --> 00:02:32,030
You gave the shop to him,

29
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:34,230
and you're not feeling good, are you?

30
00:02:40,629 --> 00:02:42,230
Actually,

31
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:45,269
the moment I knew the real reason
why my uncle went to Chongming,

32
00:02:45,269 --> 00:02:46,990
my heart was filled with hatred for Nie Xinghe.

33
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:49,910
But I also know

34
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:52,430
it's pointless

35
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:53,830
to pursue it now.

36
00:02:55,109 --> 00:02:57,030
I won't easily forgive

37
00:02:57,629 --> 00:02:59,149
and let go of all this.

38

39
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:15,909

40
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:19,389
Because that was his wish.

00:03:22,387 --> 00:03:23,507
I believe

42
00:03:24,083 --> 00:03:26,230
he would approve of it too.

What have you been up to all morning?

44
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:04,789
An important thing.

00:04:11,429 --> 00:04:13,230
What do you really feel about my brother?

48
00:04:15,189 --> 00:04:16,709
I confessed to him

49
00:04:16,709 --> 00:04:17,990
and got rejected.

50
00:04:18,990 --> 00:04:20,370
My brother has been single for so long,

51
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:22,430
and h-h-he's just a bit slow.

52
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:23,859
But sometimes, what he says--

53
00:04:23,859 --> 00:04:25,169
But do you know it?

54
00:04:25,169 --> 00:04:27,430
He rejected me very seriously.

55
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:29,350
He even made a PowerPoint presentation for me.

56
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:32,864
T-T-This is quite like his style.

57
00:04:32,864 --> 00:04:36,147
I just really like his stubbornness.

58
00:04:36,147 --> 00:04:37,683
My taste is definitely good.

59
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:40,390
Don't worry.

61
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:45,590

62
00:04:46,669 --> 00:04:47,909

96

You really don't know the reason?

97

I've sent you emails and messages,
but you didn't reply.

00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,640

Today we'll be discussing

152
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,520
the marketing that a car brand has done before.

153
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:44,719
This car brand made an advertisement

154
00:11:44,719 --> 00:11:48,180
and heavily promoted it
on a social media platform.

155
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:50,779
But the market response was particularly poor.

156
00:11:50,779 --> 00:11:53,360
Almost not even covering the marketing costs.

157
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,800
Who would like to share their thoughts

158
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,339
on the reason?

159
00:12:05,379 --> 00:12:07,379
Do you want to?

160
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:14,560
This car brand's advertisement

161
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,680
was launched on a social media platform.

162
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:18,299
The audience of this platform

163
00:12:18,299 --> 00:12:20,060
is around 20 to 30 years old,

164
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:22,239
meaning most of them are not yet married

165
00:12:22,239 --> 00:12:23,840
or have just gotten married.

166
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,601
But its marketing plan

167
00:12:25,601 --> 00:12:27,440
mainly revolved around family outings.

168
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:30,140
So I think there was a bit of a mismatch here.

169
00:12:30,819 --> 00:12:32,740
And secondly,

170
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:34,600
the language used to promote engine advantages

171
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:35,900
was a bit too professional

172
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:37,540
to understand

173
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:40,620
and might not resonate with average consumers.

174
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:45,379
What are your ideas for improvement?

175
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:51,120
I think they can use more interesting

176
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,759
or more creative forms of advertising

177
00:12:52,759 --> 00:12:54,080
combined with cars

178
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:56,120
to attract more young people.

179
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:58,561
Like shooting.

180
00:12:59,179 --> 00:13:00,179
Shooting?

181
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:03,420
Shooting is a competitive sport.

182
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:05,040
There's a type of shooting called rapid fire,

183
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,100
which determines the winner
in just a few seconds.

184
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:08,540
I think the sport

185
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:11,140
perfectly fits the zero-delay feature
of this car's engine.

186
00:13:11,859 --> 00:13:13,239
If paired with the right slogan,

187
00:13:13,239 --> 00:13:14,699
the effect should be pretty good.

188
00:13:15,739 --> 00:13:17,953
You're combining the characteristics
of the shooting sport

189
00:13:17,953 --> 00:13:20,481
with the performance of a car's engine.

190
00:13:25,569 --> 00:13:26,859
That's interesting.

191
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:30,140
Please sit.

192
00:13:30,779 --> 00:13:33,500
Well, that's all for today's class.

193
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:34,640
When you get home,

194
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:37,360
summarize your own insights.

195
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,420
Hand them in tomorrow.

196
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:40,739
Okay, class is dismissed.

197
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:49,740
I remember it now.

198
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:51,260
You are Lin Yujing.

199
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:52,820
You did a good job

200
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:55,459
in the last marketing competition.

201
00:13:55,459 --> 00:13:56,993
Thank you for your encouragement.

202
00:13:56,993 --> 00:13:58,272
I don't have much experience.

203
00:13:58,272 --> 00:13:59,827
I just expressed my ideas.

204
00:13:59,827 --> 00:14:02,447
No, you have a great understanding
of marketing.

205
00:14:02,447 --> 00:14:04,067
What's your major?

206
00:14:04,067 --> 00:14:05,546
I'm in the Finance Department.

207
00:14:06,146 --> 00:14:07,727
Such a good talent.

208
00:14:07,727 --> 00:14:11,146
What a pity that you're not a marketing major.

209
00:14:12,106 --> 00:14:13,707
Keep it up.

210
00:14:25,267 --> 00:14:26,586
<i>I'm Nie Xinghe.</i>

211
00:14:27,827 --> 00:14:29,146
Can we meet?

212
00:15:09,026 --> 00:15:10,586
You've packed everything.

213
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,624
Okay.

214
00:15:19,387 --> 00:15:20,806
The house is well maintained.

215
00:15:20,806 --> 00:15:22,146
As we agreed,

216
00:15:22,867 --> 00:15:24,326
I won't refund the deposit.

217
00:15:24,326 --> 00:15:26,066
It will cover your last month's rent.

218
00:16:19,546 --> 00:16:21,952
<i>[Qinghe Silverware]</i>

219
00:16:21,952 --> 00:16:22,986
Master,

220
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:25,307
I'm leaving.

221
00:16:26,666 --> 00:16:29,927
I plan to follow the route you traveled
when you were young

222
00:16:29,927 --> 00:16:31,827
and enhance my skills.

223
00:16:33,267 --> 00:16:34,666
But don't worry.

224
00:16:36,227 --> 00:16:38,146
Qinghe Silverware is your dream

225
00:16:38,747 --> 00:16:40,066
and also mine

226
00:16:41,307 --> 00:16:42,546
and my home.

227
00:16:45,666 --> 00:16:47,907
I will definitely come back
and hang up the sign again.

228
00:17:10,626 --> 00:17:12,466
I hope by that time,

229
00:17:13,466 --> 00:17:15,747
I've had the confidence to ask you,

230
00:17:17,056 --> 00:17:18,106
"So

231
00:17:19,347 --> 00:17:21,847
did the little boy you picked up years ago

232
00:17:21,847 --> 00:17:23,747
live up to your expectations?"

233
00:17:36,403 --> 00:17:37,503
I'm here

234
00:17:37,503 --> 00:17:38,963
to ask you for a favor.

235
00:17:41,642 --> 00:17:44,043
I plan to leave Pucheng for a while.

236
00:17:52,243 --> 00:17:53,282
Please deliver this starry sky lamp

237
00:17:55,083 --> 00:17:56,243
to Shen Juan for me.

238
00:17:57,043 --> 00:17:58,083
Let him keep it safe for me for now.

239
00:18:03,603 --> 00:18:05,043
Also, convey a message to him for me.

240
00:18:05,883 --> 00:18:06,971
Tell him

241
00:18:08,122 --> 00:18:09,523
I haven't forgotten Master's words

242
00:18:11,483 --> 00:18:12,882
and that Qinghe Silverware won't collapse.

243
00:18:14,002 --> 00:18:15,203
Why don't you tell him yourself?

244
00:18:19,562 --> 00:18:20,571
There's no need for that.

245
00:18:29,803 --> 00:18:30,875
By the way,

246
00:18:32,842 --> 00:18:34,602
I'm sorry that I sent those things

247
00:18:36,842 --> 00:18:37,915
to your mom.

248
00:18:47,162 --> 00:18:48,602
He left only these words

249
00:18:49,282 --> 00:18:50,403
and this starry sky lamp.

250
00:18:51,763 --> 00:18:53,442
Hope he has really figured it out.

251
00:20:19,403 --> 00:20:21,003
See what he sent. "Are you free tomorrow?

252
00:20:21,003 --> 00:20:22,323
I have something to tell you."

253
00:20:22,922 --> 00:20:24,982
Isn't he just taking advantage
of my affection for him?

254
00:20:24,982 --> 00:20:26,883
Thinking that I will come over
just because he wants me to?

255
00:20:27,523 --> 00:20:29,042
That's not quite right.

256
00:20:29,682 --> 00:20:31,043
He is just asking you,

257
00:20:31,043 --> 00:20:32,183
not commanding you.

258
00:20:32,183 --> 00:20:34,702
Besides,
you didn't even respond to him, did you?

259
00:20:34,702 --> 00:20:36,723
Because he was wrong.

260
00:20:36,723 --> 00:20:38,023
I know

261
00:20:38,023 --> 00:20:39,203
he is just a block of ice.

262
00:20:39,883 --> 00:20:42,203
But I thought that I would melt him one day.

263
00:20:42,883 --> 00:20:44,223
But I didn't expect that he was not just ice

264
00:20:44,223 --> 00:20:45,242
but also a refrigerator.

265
00:20:45,763 --> 00:20:46,903
Before I could melt him,

266
00:20:46,903 --> 00:20:48,083
he froze me to death.

267
00:20:49,602 --> 00:20:50,783
You are even laughing at me.

268
00:20:50,783 --> 00:20:51,922
I won't.

269
00:20:52,563 --> 00:20:55,563
Eat some meat.
Why not drown your sorrows in food?

270
00:21:02,323 --> 00:21:04,482
It doesn't matter if he's a refrigerator.

271
00:21:05,403 --> 00:21:06,482
I can cut off the power.

272
00:21:07,602 --> 00:21:09,643
But he can't hand the socket over
to someone else.

273
00:21:16,722 --> 00:21:19,003
Don't be sad. Your refrigerator is calling.

274
00:21:20,403 --> 00:21:21,842
Do I have to answer his call?

275
00:21:23,443 --> 00:21:25,242
Alright, then we'll ignore him.

276
00:21:26,282 --> 00:21:27,403
I'll hang up for you.

277
00:21:34,922 --> 00:21:36,842
Why aren't you replying to my WeChat messages?

278
00:21:37,443 --> 00:21:38,491
What's up?

279
00:21:39,403 --> 00:21:40,475
Have you been drinking?

280
00:21:41,042 --> 00:21:42,043
Where are you?

281
00:21:42,043 --> 00:21:43,682
At the crossroad skewer shop.

282
00:21:44,523 --> 00:21:45,602
<i>Wait for me. I'll be right there.</i>

283
00:22:00,282 --> 00:22:01,482
He's really a blockhead.

284
00:22:02,123 --> 00:22:03,563
He's really a blockhead.

285
00:22:03,563 --> 00:22:05,003
You are now fed up with him.

286
00:22:05,003 --> 00:22:06,323
But who told me

287
00:22:06,883 --> 00:22:08,103
she just liked

288
00:22:08,103 --> 00:22:09,623
dedicated and serious men

289
00:22:09,623 --> 00:22:11,802
devoted to their careers?

290
00:22:21,282 --> 00:22:22,403
Is that the man?

291
00:22:22,403 --> 00:22:23,823
He is quite handsome.

292
00:22:23,823 --> 00:22:25,643
No wonder you're attracted to him.

293
00:22:31,403 --> 00:22:32,963
This is my roommate, Little Mushroom.

294
00:22:33,482 --> 00:22:34,491
Hello.

295
00:22:35,123 --> 00:22:36,323
This is lawyer Fu Mingxiu.

296
00:22:38,003 --> 00:22:39,323
Why did you drink so much?

297
00:22:39,323 --> 00:22:41,323
I'm not your intern anymore.

298
00:22:41,323 --> 00:22:42,443
Why do you care?

299
00:22:46,643 --> 00:22:48,682
Don't just stand. Please sit down.

300
00:23:06,482 --> 00:23:07,842
What did you come to see me for?

301
00:23:11,883 --> 00:23:13,362
I just wanted to tell you

302
00:23:13,362 --> 00:23:15,083
the person yesterday was my client

303
00:23:15,963 --> 00:23:18,203
and that the capsule toy was a gift
she was going to give her son.

304
00:23:18,722 --> 00:23:20,282
Why are you telling me this?

305
00:23:21,042 --> 00:23:22,602
Because I don't want you to misunderstand.

306
00:23:26,362 --> 00:23:28,363
Why don't you want me to misunderstand?

307
00:23:28,363 --> 00:23:29,443
Because…

308
00:23:35,362 --> 00:23:37,443
because no one likes to be misunderstood.

309
00:23:40,842 --> 00:23:41,883
Okay.

310
00:23:43,003 --> 00:23:44,242
I won't misunderstand you.

311
00:23:44,802 --> 00:23:45,819
You can go back now.

312
00:23:49,802 --> 00:23:51,303
I explained to you,

313
00:23:51,303 --> 00:23:52,483
but you didn't reply to my message.

314
00:23:52,483 --> 00:23:54,563
But if I didn't explain, you would be unhappy.

315
00:23:54,563 --> 00:23:55,963
So what do you want me to do?

316
00:23:58,883 --> 00:24:00,023
I'm leaving.

317
00:24:00,023 --> 00:24:01,023
Little Mushroom,

318
00:24:01,023 --> 00:24:02,842
you take a cab back later.

319
00:24:05,802 --> 00:24:06,875
Excuse me.

320
00:24:30,842 --> 00:24:33,523
<i>[I think
Gu Xia has a chance with your brother.]</i>

321
00:24:44,322 --> 00:24:46,302
Single square with one foot
and double square with both feet.

322
00:24:46,302 --> 00:24:47,403
One foot.

323
00:24:47,403 --> 00:24:48,475
Again.

324
00:24:50,282 --> 00:24:51,882
I'm not bad at this, am I?

325
00:24:51,882 --> 00:24:53,403
I'm not worse than you, am I?

326
00:24:55,843 --> 00:24:58,003
Yes, you're much better than me.

327
00:25:00,123 --> 00:25:02,463
It was wrong of me to record a video

328
00:25:02,463 --> 00:25:03,723
of you last time to threaten you.

329
00:25:05,042 --> 00:25:06,562
I just made a fool of myself too.

330
00:25:07,082 --> 00:25:08,243
We're even now.

331
00:25:12,082 --> 00:25:13,603
Don't drink so much next time.

332
00:25:20,202 --> 00:25:21,403
It's all because of you.

333
00:25:42,003 --> 00:25:43,003
Mr. Fu,

334
00:25:45,363 --> 00:25:46,503
sometimes,

335
00:25:46,503 --> 00:25:48,442
I really don't know what you're thinking about.

336
00:25:49,403 --> 00:25:50,603
I really like you.

337
00:25:50,603 --> 00:25:51,723
I really want to pursue you.

338
00:25:52,322 --> 00:25:53,723
Am I making things difficult for you?

339
00:25:58,523 --> 00:25:59,562
No, you're not.

340
00:26:01,082 --> 00:26:02,162
It's just unexpected.

341
00:26:05,162 --> 00:26:06,563
I'm not good

342
00:26:06,563 --> 00:26:08,003
with unexpected stuff.

343
00:26:11,962 --> 00:26:14,243
You've known Lin Yujing for quite a long time,

344
00:26:16,123 --> 00:26:17,922
so you should know about my family situation.

345
00:26:23,843 --> 00:26:24,962
In my senior year of high school,

346
00:26:27,243 --> 00:26:28,411
my dad

347
00:26:29,202 --> 00:26:32,162
suddenly had a brain hemorrhage
and passed away.

348
00:26:35,123 --> 00:26:36,503
In the morning, we were still

349
00:26:36,503 --> 00:26:37,802
eating breakfast together,

350
00:26:37,802 --> 00:26:39,162
chatting and laughing.

351
00:26:40,202 --> 00:26:41,243
In the afternoon,

352
00:26:41,962 --> 00:26:43,363
he was covered with a white cloth.

353
00:26:46,802 --> 00:26:48,082
Have you ever felt that?

354
00:26:49,523 --> 00:26:50,603
A thing

355
00:26:50,603 --> 00:26:53,042
happens so suddenly

356
00:26:54,603 --> 00:26:56,122
and leaves you

357
00:26:56,122 --> 00:26:57,622
completely unprepared

358
00:26:57,622 --> 00:26:59,202
and powerless?

359
00:27:02,883 --> 00:27:04,962
I really hate that feeling.

360
00:27:13,123 --> 00:27:14,203
Don't worry,

361
00:27:14,802 --> 00:27:16,003
I'm fine now.

362
00:27:19,363 --> 00:27:21,003
When choosing my college major,

363
00:27:21,763 --> 00:27:23,403
I insisted on choosing law

364
00:27:24,363 --> 00:27:25,543
because I thought

365
00:27:25,543 --> 00:27:26,682
it was like hopscotch.

366
00:27:27,202 --> 00:27:28,403
It has a fixed framework.

367
00:27:29,802 --> 00:27:31,003
As long as you're well prepared,

368
00:27:32,483 --> 00:27:34,003
no surprises will happen.

369
00:27:43,483 --> 00:27:45,523
But life is not hopscotch,

370
00:27:46,403 --> 00:27:47,547
nor is it law.

371
00:27:48,562 --> 00:27:51,442
There will always be surprises
and opportunities.

372
00:27:52,162 --> 00:27:54,843
It's always full of uncertainties.

373
00:27:57,202 --> 00:27:58,682
Yes,

374
00:27:58,682 --> 00:27:59,682
just like you.

375
00:28:06,483 --> 00:28:07,723
Now you're only a freshman,

376
00:28:08,403 --> 00:28:09,467
still very young.

377
00:28:10,562 --> 00:28:12,863
You've never even stepped out
of the university gate.

378
00:28:12,863 --> 00:28:13,963
You haven't really seen

379
00:28:13,963 --> 00:28:15,403
the outside world.

380
00:28:16,843 --> 00:28:18,003
How can you be so sure

381
00:28:18,802 --> 00:28:19,922
that you won't meet

382
00:28:20,723 --> 00:28:21,843
someone you like more in the future?

383
00:28:32,723 --> 00:28:34,682
Right now I'm not,

384
00:28:35,282 --> 00:28:36,403
but you can't reject me

385
00:28:36,403 --> 00:28:37,603
just because of that.

386
00:28:39,162 --> 00:28:42,083
I can't wait for 30 or 50 years

387
00:28:42,083 --> 00:28:43,363
until my hair has turned white

388
00:28:43,363 --> 00:28:44,623
and I've lost all my teeth,

389
00:28:44,623 --> 00:28:45,643
then squint at you

390
00:28:46,523 --> 00:28:47,962
and say,

391
00:28:48,922 --> 00:28:50,322
"Mr. Fu,

392
00:28:50,922 --> 00:28:53,042
I've thought for a lifetime.

393
00:28:53,723 --> 00:28:56,363
I really only like you.

394
00:28:57,082 --> 00:28:58,682
Be with me, okay?"

395
00:28:59,523 --> 00:29:00,763
That's impossible, right?

396
00:29:10,723 --> 00:29:11,771
Gu Xia,

397
00:29:13,322 --> 00:29:14,682
what do you like about me?

398
00:29:25,403 --> 00:29:27,162
Actually, I don't know.

399
00:29:28,922 --> 00:29:30,123
But

400
00:29:31,442 --> 00:29:33,003
when I'm with you,

401
00:29:34,123 --> 00:29:35,123
I want to look at you.

402
00:29:36,442 --> 00:29:38,123
When I'm not with you,

403
00:29:39,162 --> 00:29:41,162
I try to see you.

404
00:29:44,763 --> 00:29:45,883
Isn't it silly?

405
00:29:46,562 --> 00:29:48,063
I don't know.

406
00:29:48,063 --> 00:29:49,403
But I feel like

407
00:29:51,643 --> 00:29:52,883
this is what liking someone feels like.

408
00:29:57,643 --> 00:29:58,747
What about you?

409
00:30:02,403 --> 00:30:03,483
Do you have

410
00:30:06,082 --> 00:30:07,131
this kind of feeling

411
00:30:08,883 --> 00:30:10,162
for me

412
00:30:10,162 --> 00:30:11,883
even if it's just a little?

413
00:30:14,715 --> 00:30:19,856
<i>♫ Time is a flower of dream ♫</i>

414
00:30:20,795 --> 00:30:24,973
<i>♫ With countless words left unsaid ♫</i>

415
00:30:26,304 --> 00:30:30,317
<i>♫ That night you waited for me ♫</i>

416
00:30:33,483 --> 00:30:34,883
Look.

417
00:30:34,883 --> 00:30:36,042
The stars in the sky.

418
00:30:41,042 --> 00:30:43,112
And my star?

419
00:30:43,112 --> 00:30:47,262
<i>♫ Yet worried linger within my eyes ♫</i>

420
00:30:48,859 --> 00:30:52,685
<i>♫ Our story hasn't ended ♫</i>

421
00:30:54,239 --> 00:30:58,014
<i>♫ So where are we now ♫</i>

422
00:30:59,739 --> 00:31:04,840
<i>♫ I want to hug you so badly ♫</i>

423
00:31:05,371 --> 00:31:09,930
<i>♫ I want to become better with you ♫</i>

424
00:31:10,917 --> 00:31:14,951
<i>♫ The youth we shared ♫</i>

425
00:31:15,483 --> 00:31:21,560
<i>♫ Turned into a rainbow within my heart ♫</i>

426
00:31:22,112 --> 00:31:27,167
<i>♫ I really want to warm you ♫</i>

427
00:31:27,674 --> 00:31:34,334
<i>♫ I want to share with you
the beauty of the world ♫</i>

428
00:31:35,250 --> 00:31:37,563
<i>♫ We promised ♫</i>

429
00:31:37,563 --> 00:31:43,893
<i>♫ To never be apart ♫</i>

430
00:32:07,867 --> 00:32:08,923
<i>Look.</i>

431
00:32:18,763 --> 00:32:19,835
Awake already?

432
00:32:22,763 --> 00:32:24,003
Good morning, Mr. Fu.

433
00:32:27,442 --> 00:32:28,463
It was too late yesterday.

434
00:32:28,463 --> 00:32:29,843
Your dormitory was locked,

435
00:32:29,843 --> 00:32:32,003
so I brought you to my office.

436
00:32:35,082 --> 00:32:36,091
But don't worry.

437
00:32:36,843 --> 00:32:38,463
I've already talked to Lin Yujing.

438
00:32:38,463 --> 00:32:39,723
They all know it?

439
00:32:39,723 --> 00:32:41,523
You didn't go back all night.
I had to tell them.

440
00:32:43,363 --> 00:32:44,843
And last night your roommate

441
00:32:44,843 --> 00:32:46,403
saw the two of us leave together.

442
00:32:47,763 --> 00:32:48,827
So

443
00:32:49,523 --> 00:32:51,003
sorry for the trouble last night.

444
00:32:52,843 --> 00:32:54,703
You do your work. I'm leaving.

445
00:32:54,703 --> 00:32:55,707
Wait.

446
00:32:58,723 --> 00:33:00,003
I will take you somewhere.

447
00:33:10,242 --> 00:33:11,563
Why did you bring me here?

448
00:33:13,603 --> 00:33:14,603
Last time you said

449
00:33:14,603 --> 00:33:15,762
you didn't think about what to wish for.

450
00:33:16,442 --> 00:33:18,083
It's a bit regretful not to hang a lock.

451
00:33:19,083 --> 00:33:20,183
I looked it up.

452
00:33:20,183 --> 00:33:22,442
The love lock only makes sense
when two are hung together.

453
00:33:23,323 --> 00:33:24,363
So

454
00:33:24,363 --> 00:33:25,603
I want to do it again.

455
00:33:26,843 --> 00:33:27,843
What does it mean?

456
00:33:31,482 --> 00:33:33,162
I read the presentation you gave me.

457
00:33:33,722 --> 00:33:36,762
This time, I think your analysis makes sense.

458
00:33:37,922 --> 00:33:39,442
Actually,

459
00:33:39,442 --> 00:33:41,603
this is quite ridiculous.

460
00:33:44,123 --> 00:33:45,147
You're right.

461
00:33:45,803 --> 00:33:47,163
In some ways,

462
00:33:47,163 --> 00:33:48,283
I am as blunt as a piece of wood.

463
00:33:49,162 --> 00:33:50,363
It's clearly a matter of relationship.

464
00:33:51,123 --> 00:33:52,803
But I used the logical thinking

465
00:33:53,442 --> 00:33:55,242
from work,

466
00:33:56,323 --> 00:33:57,943
and because of that,

467
00:33:57,943 --> 00:33:59,403
I made that ridiculous presentation.

468
00:34:00,002 --> 00:34:01,179
It's good that you know it.

469
00:34:01,962 --> 00:34:02,962
I also figured it out.

470
00:34:04,722 --> 00:34:06,303
Even if I list

471
00:34:06,303 --> 00:34:08,202
a thousand reasons
why we should not be together,

472
00:34:08,202 --> 00:34:09,682
it can't beat one sentence,

473
00:34:19,162 --> 00:34:20,202
"I like you".

474
00:34:26,563 --> 00:34:27,603
Yesterday,

475
00:34:28,283 --> 00:34:30,762
I recalled every bit of our time together.

476
00:34:39,002 --> 00:34:40,283
I am now completely sure.

477
00:34:42,002 --> 00:34:43,067
Gu Xia,

478
00:34:43,722 --> 00:34:44,762
I'm into you.

479
00:34:47,002 --> 00:34:48,043
I don't want to miss you.

480
00:34:48,682 --> 00:34:50,043
Even if in the future--

481
00:34:50,043 --> 00:34:51,283
There is no "even if".

482
00:34:52,722 --> 00:34:53,922
Let's enjoy the present.

483
00:35:19,283 --> 00:35:20,423
I bought two locks.

484
00:35:20,423 --> 00:35:21,482
Let's hang them.

485
00:35:24,043 --> 00:35:26,242
Actually, I already did it last time.

486
00:35:36,242 --> 00:35:37,243
Let's go.

487
00:35:43,403 --> 00:35:44,962
Seems this lock is quite effective.

488
00:36:27,643 --> 00:36:28,803
What are you doing?

489
00:36:30,242 --> 00:36:31,563
Don't stare at me like this.

490
00:36:38,242 --> 00:36:41,143
Alright, I'll be honest with you.

491
00:36:41,143 --> 00:36:42,283
I am with your brother,

492
00:36:42,922 --> 00:36:44,803
and he confessed it.

493
00:36:45,843 --> 00:36:46,982
From your radiant face,

494
00:36:46,982 --> 00:36:48,027
I guessed it.

495
00:36:48,563 --> 00:36:50,962
Congratulations, you finally got together.

496
00:36:57,922 --> 00:37:00,063
- What are you doing?
- Mocking him.

497
00:37:00,063 --> 00:37:01,482
The one who couldn't resist it

498
00:37:01,482 --> 00:37:02,803
- Don't.
- with all his talk of rationality.

499
00:37:02,803 --> 00:37:05,043
Don't do that. He's shy. He can't take it.

500
00:37:06,843 --> 00:37:07,883
You're already worried about him.

501
00:37:09,722 --> 00:37:10,843
Alright.

502
00:37:13,242 --> 00:37:14,482
What were you just looking at?

503
00:37:15,363 --> 00:37:16,363
You seemed very focused.

504
00:37:19,123 --> 00:37:21,762
The enrollment guide
for the Financial Innovation Class.

505
00:37:24,244 --> 00:37:25,464
<i>I once thought</i>

506
00:37:25,464 --> 00:37:27,504
<i>that dreams were birds with wings,</i>

507
00:37:27,504 --> 00:37:28,684
<i>hard to find.</i>

508
00:37:29,803 --> 00:37:31,744
<i>When I found my dream,</i>

509
00:37:31,744 --> 00:37:33,683
<i>I realized it was in the palm of my hand,</i>

510
00:37:33,683 --> 00:37:34,963
<i>waiting for me to unfold.</i>

511
00:37:36,244 --> 00:37:38,524
<i>I am no longer
a child being disciplined or told</i>

512
00:37:38,524 --> 00:37:40,244
<i>what I should do.</i>

513
00:37:41,003 --> 00:37:42,283
<i>I have my own life path.</i>

514
00:37:42,923 --> 00:37:44,843
<i>I am going to chase my dream
without holding back.</i>
