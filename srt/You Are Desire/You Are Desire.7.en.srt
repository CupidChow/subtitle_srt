00:01:35,396 --> 00:01:36,476
My uncle said

20
00:01:38,597 --> 00:01:40,836
my mom turned into a star
in the sky, watching me.

21
00:01:43,476 --> 00:01:44,597
But after people die,

22
00:01:45,437 --> 00:01:46,877
how can they become stars?

23
00:01:49,116 --> 00:01:51,477
It's nothing but his comforting words.

24
00:02:05,597 --> 00:02:07,156
But when the sea of stars lights up--

25
00:02:07,156 --> 00:02:09,116
It seems like all gloom can be dispelled.

26
00:02:30,196 --> 00:02:33,357
Hello, my name is Lin Yujing.

27
00:02:33,997 --> 00:02:35,236
I'm Shen Juan's desk mate.

28
00:02:43,076 --> 00:02:46,016
I'll make sure he studies hard

29
00:02:46,016 --> 00:02:47,516
and ensure his graduation.

30
00:02:52,357 --> 00:02:55,557
Uncle, can you hear her?

31
00:02:56,676 --> 00:02:59,796
If I can't graduate, it's all her fault.

32
00:03:04,676 --> 00:03:07,096
Shen Juan, sign papers at the nurse station.

33
00:03:07,096 --> 00:03:09,617
Okay, let's go.

34
00:03:09,617 --> 00:03:10,997
Goodbye.

35
00:03:10,997 --> 00:03:12,956
I will often come to see you.

36
00:03:27,197 --> 00:03:30,517
Shen Juan, sign your uncle's medical report.

37
00:03:30,517 --> 00:03:31,552
Okay.

38
00:03:32,956 --> 00:03:34,837
There's an infection in your uncle's lungs.

39
00:03:34,837 --> 00:03:36,296
But don't worry too much.

40
00:03:36,296 --> 00:03:37,497
We will do our best

41
00:03:37,497 --> 00:03:38,517
to make his vital signs stable.

42
00:03:38,517 --> 00:03:39,636
Okay, thanks.

43
00:03:40,596 --> 00:03:42,437
By the way, a boy about your age

44
00:03:42,437 --> 00:03:43,797
came yesterday.

45
00:03:45,312 --> 00:03:46,496
Did you let him in?

46
00:03:46,496 --> 00:03:47,757
We didn't.

47
00:03:47,757 --> 00:03:50,596
Dr. Gu instructed us not to let strangers in.

48
00:03:52,384 --> 00:03:53,437
Okay, thanks.

49
00:03:53,437 --> 00:03:55,917
Next time he comes, please let me know.

50
00:03:55,917 --> 00:03:56,960
Okay.

51
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,080
Thanks.

52
00:03:59,392 --> 00:04:00,557
Let's go.

53
00:04:01,876 --> 00:04:03,636
Do you know the guy she just mentioned?

54
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:06,720
He…

55
00:04:11,997 --> 00:04:13,120
<i>Where are you, Lin Yujing?</i>

56
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,277
My brother.

57
00:04:14,277 --> 00:04:15,596
You disappeared early in the morning.

58
00:04:16,436 --> 00:04:18,756
<i>I'm your guardian now.</i>

59
00:04:18,756 --> 00:04:20,277
You just left without telling me?

60
00:04:20,277 --> 00:04:21,916
I'm already at your school entrance.

61
00:04:25,036 --> 00:04:26,144
<i>It's Shen Juan.</i>

62
00:04:34,957 --> 00:04:36,557
It's you.

63
00:04:36,557 --> 00:04:38,356
<i>Where are you guys now?</i>

64
00:04:39,196 --> 00:04:41,636
We're in downtown,
and I'll send her back later.

65
00:04:42,677 --> 00:04:43,797
<i>Okay, you tell her</i>

66
00:04:43,797 --> 00:04:45,577
<i>I'm at the school entrance to pick her up.</i>

67
00:04:45,577 --> 00:04:47,356
There's something at home.

68
00:04:48,316 --> 00:04:49,376
<i>Okay.</i>

69
00:04:52,717 --> 00:04:55,517
Your brother said there's something at home.

70
00:04:56,997 --> 00:04:58,597
What will come will come.

71
00:04:58,597 --> 00:05:00,237
Let's go back.

72
00:05:14,837 --> 00:05:16,497
You kept me waiting.

73
00:05:16,497 --> 00:05:17,837
You're really troublesome.

74
00:05:17,837 --> 00:05:18,837
Get in now.

75
00:05:19,517 --> 00:05:20,797
Aren't I here now?

76
00:05:20,797 --> 00:05:21,817
Get in the car.

77
00:05:21,817 --> 00:05:22,857
Lin Yujing.

78
00:05:22,857 --> 00:05:24,517
Call me if something happens.

79
00:05:25,837 --> 00:05:26,956
What could happen?

80
00:05:26,956 --> 00:05:28,077
Can't I help her?

81
00:05:28,717 --> 00:05:29,824
Get in the car.

82
00:05:32,797 --> 00:05:33,920
Bye.

83
00:05:48,877 --> 00:05:51,857
You've been paying extra attention
to your deskmate recently.

84
00:05:51,857 --> 00:05:53,277
Just a reminder,

85
00:05:53,277 --> 00:05:55,116
studying well is your job.

86
00:05:56,236 --> 00:05:58,017
Did Meng Weiguo ask me to go back?

87
00:05:58,017 --> 00:06:00,057
What for? To lecture me again?

88
00:06:00,057 --> 00:06:02,197
Don't you check our family's WeChat group?

89
00:06:03,676 --> 00:06:05,996
Your dad bought your favorite roast duck.

90
00:06:06,517 --> 00:06:08,077
There's probably something up.

91
00:06:15,637 --> 00:06:18,937
Your dad has been upset
about you boarding at school.

92
00:06:18,937 --> 00:06:21,356
Most likely, he wants you to move back home.

93
00:06:24,156 --> 00:06:25,437
I don't understand.

94
00:06:25,437 --> 00:06:27,116
Why does he insist on this

95
00:06:27,116 --> 00:06:28,676
given your relationship?

96
00:06:29,197 --> 00:06:30,576
What's not to get?

97
00:06:30,576 --> 00:06:31,697
He wants to establish his image

98
00:06:31,697 --> 00:06:33,116
in front of you and your mom.

99
00:06:36,236 --> 00:06:37,637
So, have you thought about what to do?

100
00:06:39,397 --> 00:06:40,996
Actually, there is a way.

101
00:06:41,996 --> 00:06:43,036
It's just…

102
00:06:45,036 --> 00:06:46,117
just what?

103
00:06:46,117 --> 00:06:48,197
It's just that I need your help.

104
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,837
Are you ready?

105
00:07:02,236 --> 00:07:03,796
I won't hold back later.

106
00:07:03,796 --> 00:07:05,397
Neither will I.

107
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,096
Five,

108
00:07:08,096 --> 00:07:09,256
four,

109
00:07:09,256 --> 00:07:10,356
three,

110
00:07:10,356 --> 00:07:11,357
two,

111
00:07:11,357 --> 00:07:13,036
one, start.

112
00:07:16,197 --> 00:07:17,557
Fu Mingxiu, tell me.

113
00:07:17,557 --> 00:07:20,337
Are you mute? Don't give me that attitude.

114
00:07:20,337 --> 00:07:21,697
Let's make it clear.

115
00:07:21,697 --> 00:07:23,136
What did I do to annoy you?

116
00:07:23,136 --> 00:07:24,160
Tell me why?

117
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,116
I hate you without reason.

118
00:07:27,317 --> 00:07:29,717
What's going on? Stop arguing.

119
00:07:35,116 --> 00:07:37,056
Ever since you and your father moved in,

120
00:07:37,056 --> 00:07:38,637
this house has been full of fighting.

121
00:07:38,637 --> 00:07:40,036
It's seriously disturbing my life.

122
00:07:40,637 --> 00:07:42,277
Your dad and my mom

123
00:07:42,277 --> 00:07:43,997
are legally married.

124
00:07:43,997 --> 00:07:46,736
But you and I have no blood relation

125
00:07:46,736 --> 00:07:48,717
or emotional foundation.

126
00:07:48,717 --> 00:07:50,017
So, I don't have to put up with you,

127
00:07:50,017 --> 00:07:52,076
and I have no obligation to like you.

128
00:07:52,076 --> 00:07:53,077
Do you understand?

129
00:07:54,156 --> 00:07:56,437
Dad, you heard him.

130
00:07:56,437 --> 00:07:58,356
This home has never welcomed me.

131
00:08:01,277 --> 00:08:02,637
Y-Your brother…

132
00:08:02,637 --> 00:08:04,817
- He didn't mean it.
- I meant it.

133
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:06,077
Fu Mingxiu, don't go too far.

134
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,197
Food's ready.

135
00:08:11,637 --> 00:08:13,517
Let's eat first.

136
00:08:13,517 --> 00:08:14,796
Let's eat.

137
00:08:39,317 --> 00:08:41,156
Mingxiu, have a shrimp.

138
00:08:43,072 --> 00:08:44,197
Mingxiu,

139
00:08:45,796 --> 00:08:47,397
Yujing is still young.

140
00:08:48,277 --> 00:08:50,437
It's always inconvenient

141
00:08:50,437 --> 00:08:52,156
for a girl to live at school.

142
00:08:53,877 --> 00:08:57,497
No matter what, we are still a family,

143
00:08:57,497 --> 00:08:58,556
right?

144
00:08:59,317 --> 00:09:00,837
She's not my family.

145
00:09:02,517 --> 00:09:04,517
I can't live under the same roof as her.

146
00:09:09,116 --> 00:09:10,197
You are her brother,

147
00:09:10,197 --> 00:09:12,877
and she's your younger sister.
You're maturer than her.

148
00:09:13,517 --> 00:09:15,457
If Yujing does something wrong,

149
00:09:15,457 --> 00:09:18,877
you should be more forgiving, alright?

150
00:09:20,236 --> 00:09:21,236
Yujing,

151
00:09:21,236 --> 00:09:23,356
why don't you apologize to Mingxiu first?

152
00:09:25,556 --> 00:09:27,097
He started it.

153
00:09:27,097 --> 00:09:28,116
Why should I apologize?

154
00:09:29,757 --> 00:09:32,236
How can you be so stubborn?

155
00:09:37,476 --> 00:09:38,676
Have you finished?

156
00:09:39,437 --> 00:09:40,437
I'll clean up the table.

157
00:10:02,476 --> 00:10:04,356
<i>Is everything going smoothly?</i>

158
00:10:07,516 --> 00:10:09,797
<i>Yes, don't worry.</i>

159
00:10:16,448 --> 00:10:17,596
Come in.

160
00:10:24,576 --> 00:10:25,717
What are you doing?

161
00:10:31,037 --> 00:10:33,376
Where is all your stuff?

162
00:10:33,376 --> 00:10:35,197
Just say what you want to say.

163
00:10:37,077 --> 00:10:38,208
Here's the thing.

164
00:10:39,197 --> 00:10:41,437
We have discussed it.

165
00:10:41,437 --> 00:10:42,777
And she thought

166
00:10:42,777 --> 00:10:44,636
we should

167
00:10:45,157 --> 00:10:46,236
respect your decisions.

168
00:10:47,557 --> 00:10:49,597
If you want to live at school,

169
00:10:49,597 --> 00:10:50,677
it's not impossible.

170
00:10:55,437 --> 00:10:58,257
I got it. I'll go back to school today.

171
00:10:58,257 --> 00:10:59,636
Going back today?

172
00:10:59,636 --> 00:11:00,917
Why are you in such a rush?

173
00:11:01,876 --> 00:11:03,756
I've already moved my stuff to school.

174
00:11:10,197 --> 00:11:12,476
Yujing, here's the thing.

175
00:11:13,516 --> 00:11:14,736
You're living at school,

176
00:11:14,736 --> 00:11:15,957
but it's just temporary.

177
00:11:17,396 --> 00:11:19,837
Once everyone gets used to it,

178
00:11:20,717 --> 00:11:22,077
you can move back here.

179
00:11:22,837 --> 00:11:23,897
After all, living at home

180
00:11:23,897 --> 00:11:26,116
is much better than at school, isn't it?

181
00:11:29,837 --> 00:11:32,837
I left in a hurry before,

182
00:11:33,516 --> 00:11:36,077
so I didn't have time to buy a lot of things.

183
00:11:47,584 --> 00:11:48,857
I've transferred some money to you.

184
00:11:48,857 --> 00:11:50,016
Thanks.

185
00:11:57,116 --> 00:12:00,037
Take care of yourself at school,

186
00:12:00,037 --> 00:12:01,037
and be safe.

187
00:12:33,596 --> 00:12:34,936
Not bad, movie star.

188
00:12:34,936 --> 00:12:36,496
I feel like you've fully embodied

189
00:12:36,496 --> 00:12:38,396
an arrogant and domineering young master.

190
00:12:39,837 --> 00:12:41,477
You're not bad either.

191
00:12:41,477 --> 00:12:43,756
You acted like a helpless weak victim.

192
00:12:46,037 --> 00:12:47,276
Anyway,

193
00:12:48,317 --> 00:12:50,217
if you're not happy living at school,

194
00:12:50,217 --> 00:12:51,696
I can do a different role at any time.

195
00:12:51,696 --> 00:12:53,157
I'll act out another scene with you.

196
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,488
Don't worry.

197
00:13:03,677 --> 00:13:04,877
Is it in that direction?

198
00:13:04,877 --> 00:13:06,756
Yes, I thought it was in your building.

199
00:13:17,236 --> 00:13:18,876
Gu Xia, you're back.

200
00:13:19,717 --> 00:13:22,116
Oh my, you bought so much stuff again.

201
00:13:23,077 --> 00:13:24,817
Xu Ruyi, this is for you.

202
00:13:24,817 --> 00:13:26,597
Orange chocolate from Jeju Island.

203
00:13:26,597 --> 00:13:27,797
Thank you.

204
00:13:32,476 --> 00:13:34,057
Shiqi, I bought facial mask for you.

205
00:13:34,057 --> 00:13:35,648
Thank you.

206
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:36,876
Did you have fun in Korea?

207
00:13:36,876 --> 00:13:38,337
It was okay.

208
00:13:38,337 --> 00:13:39,417
My skincare products were all used up.

209
00:13:39,417 --> 00:13:40,516
That's why I had this journey.

210
00:13:42,276 --> 00:13:44,437
Xu Ruyi, where did you go during your vacation?

211
00:13:45,077 --> 00:13:47,677
I went to a farm with Lin Yujing.

212
00:13:47,677 --> 00:13:48,717
A farm?

213
00:13:49,317 --> 00:13:50,677
Isn't your home on a farm?

214
00:13:50,677 --> 00:13:51,957
Why go there?

215
00:13:51,957 --> 00:13:53,837
My home is in the countryside,

216
00:13:53,837 --> 00:13:55,217
not on a farm.

217
00:13:55,217 --> 00:13:57,477
What's the difference?

218
00:13:57,477 --> 00:13:58,496
I think it's a better idea

219
00:13:58,496 --> 00:14:00,097
for you to do homework in the dorm.

220
00:14:00,097 --> 00:14:01,116
Exactly.

221
00:14:02,197 --> 00:14:04,157
You made the dorm messy again.

222
00:14:04,157 --> 00:14:05,697
We'll be marked down for it.

223
00:14:05,697 --> 00:14:07,116
I'll clean it up in a bit.

224
00:14:12,292 --> 00:14:14,460
<i>[Pucheng Intercontinental Hotel]</i>

225
00:14:15,157 --> 00:14:19,557
You had a happy holiday abroad, didn't you?

226
00:14:20,437 --> 00:14:21,557
Lin Yujing!

227
00:14:43,396 --> 00:14:45,417
You're too nice.

228
00:14:45,417 --> 00:14:47,217
You can't always swallow your anger.

229
00:14:47,217 --> 00:14:48,316
If someone bullies you,

230
00:14:48,316 --> 00:14:49,396
you should fight back.

231
00:14:53,996 --> 00:14:55,577
There are ten minutes left
before the dorm is closed.

232
00:14:55,577 --> 00:14:57,116
She doesn't reply to my messages.

233
00:14:58,476 --> 00:14:59,917
Could something have happened to her?

234
00:15:07,396 --> 00:15:09,177
She still doesn't answer your call?

235
00:15:09,177 --> 00:15:11,017
Hurry up. The door is about to close.

236
00:15:11,017 --> 00:15:12,416
Let's split up and search.

237
00:15:12,416 --> 00:15:13,897
Keep in touch if anyone finds her.

238
00:15:13,897 --> 00:15:15,264
Okay.

239
00:15:22,356 --> 00:15:24,077
You always trick me.

240
00:15:24,717 --> 00:15:26,837
You tell me how many times has it been.

241
00:15:27,677 --> 00:15:28,677
The hotel was already booked,

242
00:15:28,677 --> 00:15:29,837
but where were you guys?

243
00:15:30,797 --> 00:15:32,017
I found her.

244
00:15:32,017 --> 00:15:34,037
You guys go back first. Don't worry.

245
00:15:36,276 --> 00:15:37,897
Is everything more important than me?

246
00:15:37,897 --> 00:15:39,717
Work is always more important than me.

247
00:15:39,717 --> 00:15:41,197
I don't want to hear your explanations.

248
00:15:41,197 --> 00:15:42,636
You didn't show up, anyway.

249
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:45,516
You don't care about me at all.

250
00:15:57,236 --> 00:15:59,116
Did you hear everything I just said?

251
00:16:05,037 --> 00:16:06,197
Don't cry.

252
00:16:06,717 --> 00:16:08,116
The dorm will close in three minutes.

253
00:16:08,756 --> 00:16:10,437
Hurry back if you don't want to be locked out.

254
00:16:17,396 --> 00:16:18,636
Come on.

255
00:16:30,957 --> 00:16:32,116
Lin Yujing,

256
00:16:32,116 --> 00:16:34,157
don't tell anyone about tonight.

257
00:16:34,157 --> 00:16:35,236
What if I do?

258
00:16:38,157 --> 00:16:39,717
You're overthinking.

259
00:16:39,717 --> 00:16:40,717
I didn't

260
00:16:40,717 --> 00:16:41,876
hear anything.

261
00:16:53,876 --> 00:16:54,944
Catch it.

262
00:16:55,876 --> 00:16:56,896
Pass it to me.

263
00:17:03,197 --> 00:17:04,476
You guys are really unkind.

264
00:17:05,472 --> 00:17:06,657
Going to the farm is one thing,

265
00:17:06,657 --> 00:17:08,577
but why you took so many pictures?

266
00:17:08,577 --> 00:17:10,236
Look how happy He Songnan was.

267
00:17:11,396 --> 00:17:12,677
What made him so happy?

268
00:17:17,236 --> 00:17:19,236
Why are you doing papers?

269
00:17:20,077 --> 00:17:22,257
Shen Juan said his uncle
hasn't been going to the shop lately.

270
00:17:22,257 --> 00:17:24,317
I've been helping at his shop,
but it takes time.

271
00:17:26,516 --> 00:17:28,797
You're really a good desk mate for Juan.

272
00:17:31,356 --> 00:17:33,857
Let me copy your homework later.

273
00:17:33,857 --> 00:17:35,897
Consider it as a way

274
00:17:35,897 --> 00:17:38,316
to soothe my broken heart
for not going with you guys

275
00:17:38,316 --> 00:17:39,317
How is it?

276
00:17:43,276 --> 00:17:45,077
You wish.

277
00:17:50,717 --> 00:17:52,677
What happened between you and Gu Xia?

278
00:17:52,677 --> 00:17:53,957
She was always looking at you.

279
00:17:56,276 --> 00:17:58,037
Did you have a fight?

280
00:17:58,557 --> 00:18:01,276
Do you need me to mediate for you?

281
00:18:02,917 --> 00:18:05,276
I just love to serve my classmates.

282
00:18:06,276 --> 00:18:08,357
She was looking in this direction

283
00:18:08,357 --> 00:18:09,757
probably because there's something

284
00:18:09,757 --> 00:18:10,876
stuck on your mouth.

285
00:18:22,624 --> 00:18:23,744
Do it now.

286
00:18:33,836 --> 00:18:35,097
Lin Yujing.

287
00:18:35,097 --> 00:18:36,657
I want to ask you a question.

288
00:18:36,657 --> 00:18:37,792
Go ahead.

289
00:18:38,397 --> 00:18:39,476
It's this one.

290
00:18:40,117 --> 00:18:41,137
I think

291
00:18:41,137 --> 00:18:42,397
you might have confused the words.

292
00:18:42,397 --> 00:18:44,056
You could try the association method

293
00:18:44,056 --> 00:18:45,316
to remember words.

294
00:18:46,677 --> 00:18:47,677
I

295
00:18:48,236 --> 00:18:49,397
appreciate it.

296
00:18:50,397 --> 00:18:52,288
So you deserve

297
00:18:52,288 --> 00:18:53,417
a round of applause.

298
00:18:53,417 --> 00:18:55,097
Yes, that's the idea.

299
00:18:55,097 --> 00:18:56,817
You're picking this up quite quickly.

300
00:18:56,817 --> 00:18:58,877
You spend more time to ponder over it.

301
00:18:59,437 --> 00:19:02,217
Alright, I will, thank you.

302
00:19:02,217 --> 00:19:03,392
No problem.

303
00:19:08,276 --> 00:19:09,440
Let's go.

304
00:19:11,197 --> 00:19:12,512
Lin Yujing.

305
00:19:14,117 --> 00:19:16,036
Is this endless?

306
00:19:19,276 --> 00:19:20,597
You go to the cafeteria.

307
00:19:20,597 --> 00:19:21,877
I took leave to go home.

308
00:19:23,316 --> 00:19:24,640
Okay.

309
00:19:32,076 --> 00:19:33,076
Why are you laughing?

310
00:19:33,917 --> 00:19:35,836
You promised secrecy.

311
00:19:36,796 --> 00:19:37,997
What did I promise you?

312
00:19:37,997 --> 00:19:39,168
What?

313
00:19:41,437 --> 00:19:42,497
I'm just teasing you.

314
00:19:42,497 --> 00:19:44,197
I've never told anyone.

315
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:46,737
Really?

316
00:19:46,737 --> 00:19:47,968
Yeah.

317
00:19:48,957 --> 00:19:51,077
Every family has its own difficulties.

318
00:19:51,077 --> 00:19:53,037
And it's hard to change parents' decisions.

319
00:19:53,037 --> 00:19:54,236
I understand.

320
00:19:54,756 --> 00:19:56,656
So I will never tell anyone about you.

321
00:19:56,656 --> 00:19:57,796
Don't worry.

322
00:20:01,157 --> 00:20:02,357
You need to swear to me.

323
00:20:07,357 --> 00:20:08,396
I swear.

324
00:20:08,396 --> 00:20:10,437
If I tell your secret to others,

325
00:20:10,437 --> 00:20:13,057
you'll know all my secrets.

326
00:20:13,057 --> 00:20:14,556
Who wants to know your secrets?

327
00:20:15,117 --> 00:20:17,157
I've sworn, rest assured.

328
00:20:30,236 --> 00:20:31,277
Why are you here?

329
00:20:31,277 --> 00:20:32,717
Isn't it because of you?

330
00:20:32,717 --> 00:20:34,837
The biology homework needs two people.

331
00:20:34,837 --> 00:20:36,257
I can't do it without you.

332
00:20:36,257 --> 00:20:38,036
So I asked for leave from Liu.

333
00:20:40,556 --> 00:20:41,728
Let's go.

334
00:20:44,276 --> 00:20:46,337
I still have to tutor you.

335
00:20:46,337 --> 00:20:47,877
I can't break my promise to your uncle.

336
00:20:50,516 --> 00:20:52,157
Thank you so much.

337
00:20:53,556 --> 00:20:54,877
I will do will

338
00:20:54,877 --> 00:20:56,497
in the midterm exam.

339
00:20:56,497 --> 00:20:58,076
I can't let you down.

340
00:20:58,796 --> 00:21:01,597
Alright, your favorite peach flavor.

341
00:21:01,597 --> 00:21:03,756
Don't win me again in the exam.

342
00:21:06,357 --> 00:21:07,584
I'll think about it.

343
00:22:26,677 --> 00:22:27,817
Kitty.

344
00:22:27,817 --> 00:22:28,996
Why are you here?

345
00:22:30,476 --> 00:22:32,497
Didn't your dad feed you?

346
00:22:32,497 --> 00:22:33,756
Come with me.

347
00:22:40,824 --> 00:22:42,717
<i>[Dr. Gu]</i>

348
00:22:42,717 --> 00:22:44,776
You go in first. I'll answer a call.

349
00:22:44,776 --> 00:22:45,824
Okay.

350
00:22:50,476 --> 00:22:51,877
I'll go get you some food.

351
00:23:06,756 --> 00:23:10,237
<i>Shen Juan,
your uncle's organs are failing faster</i>

352
00:23:10,237 --> 00:23:12,197
<i>than we predicted.</i>

353
00:23:12,197 --> 00:23:14,077
He was fine when I went to see him.

354
00:23:14,077 --> 00:23:15,236
How could he suddenly be like this?

355
00:23:16,076 --> 00:23:19,036
<i>Once organ failure occurs,
it's hard to reverse.</i>

356
00:23:19,036 --> 00:23:22,197
<i>The hospital suggests the guardian should come.</i>

357
00:23:28,021 --> 00:23:32,369
<i>[Dad]</i>

358
00:23:34,666 --> 00:23:39,892
<i>[Dad]</i>

359
00:24:11,677 --> 00:24:12,797
Who are you?

360
00:24:12,797 --> 00:24:14,036
Who am I?

361
00:24:14,677 --> 00:24:16,516
Hasn't Shen Juan told you?

362
00:24:22,957 --> 00:24:23,996
Long time no see.

363
00:24:24,556 --> 00:24:25,717
Nie Xinghe.

364
00:24:27,936 --> 00:24:29,057
How did you get in?

365
00:24:29,057 --> 00:24:31,357
You don't need to know that.

366
00:24:31,357 --> 00:24:33,637
Anyway, this shop isn't just yours.

367
00:24:43,597 --> 00:24:44,597
You went to the hospital?

368
00:24:45,276 --> 00:24:46,717
Can't I go see him?

369
00:24:54,957 --> 00:24:56,516
Haven't I told you

370
00:24:57,157 --> 00:24:58,577
I don't want to see you again?

371
00:24:58,577 --> 00:25:00,117
Now you see me.

372
00:25:00,117 --> 00:25:01,677
What can you do?

373
00:25:02,957 --> 00:25:04,877
Hit me again?

374
00:25:10,276 --> 00:25:11,516
Shen Juan, calm down.

375
00:25:13,036 --> 00:25:14,217
Hit me if you dare.

376
00:25:14,217 --> 00:25:15,357
Come on.

377
00:25:15,357 --> 00:25:16,796
Shut up.

378
00:25:16,796 --> 00:25:17,936
Shen Juan, you can't.

379
00:25:17,936 --> 00:25:19,836
Do you want to be suspended again?

380
00:25:27,917 --> 00:25:29,184
Shen Juan.

381
00:25:30,357 --> 00:25:31,637
What is she to you?

382
00:25:33,236 --> 00:25:34,717
Remember what this place is?

383
00:25:35,437 --> 00:25:36,796
How can you let anyone in?

384
00:25:44,236 --> 00:25:45,476
Anyone can come here,

385
00:25:46,197 --> 00:25:47,397
except you.

386
00:25:47,397 --> 00:25:48,777
Let go.

387
00:25:48,777 --> 00:25:49,817
I don't know who you are,

388
00:25:49,817 --> 00:25:51,037
and I'm not interested.

389
00:25:51,037 --> 00:25:52,117
Please leave.

390
00:25:54,276 --> 00:25:55,357
Get out.

391
00:26:00,597 --> 00:26:02,137
Didn't I tell you not to fight?

392
00:26:02,137 --> 00:26:04,117
How do you study and do silverwork?

393
00:26:05,088 --> 00:26:06,217
Shen Juan.

394
00:26:06,217 --> 00:26:07,316
Leave me alone.

395
00:26:15,556 --> 00:26:17,516
Have you lost something?

396
00:26:23,476 --> 00:26:24,717
My uncle's manuscript is gone.

397
00:26:25,236 --> 00:26:26,437
Let me bandage your hand first.

398
00:26:29,117 --> 00:26:30,117
Shen Juan.

399
00:26:45,357 --> 00:26:46,437
Here's your medicine.

400
00:26:46,437 --> 00:26:47,476
Thank you.

401
00:27:22,490 --> 00:27:27,740
<i>[Bandage]</i>

402
00:27:54,756 --> 00:27:56,236
Did Shen Juan have a fight?

403
00:27:56,796 --> 00:27:59,017
Don't make things up. He's a top student now.

404
00:27:59,017 --> 00:28:00,036
Morning.

405
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:14,597
What happened to your hand?

406
00:28:18,784 --> 00:28:19,796
It's scratched by a cat.

407
00:28:20,357 --> 00:28:21,408
A cat?

408
00:28:23,756 --> 00:28:26,036
You mean that stray cat?

409
00:28:26,677 --> 00:28:28,437
Didn't Juan treat it well?

410
00:28:28,437 --> 00:28:29,877
Providing it with food, water,

411
00:28:29,877 --> 00:28:30,896
and even shelter.

412
00:28:30,896 --> 00:28:32,496
If I were you, I would throw it out.

413
00:28:32,496 --> 00:28:33,597
Don't criticize that cat.

414
00:28:34,157 --> 00:28:35,677
It can behave much better than someone.

415
00:28:44,717 --> 00:28:45,997
I haven't had breakfast yet.

416
00:28:45,997 --> 00:28:47,117
I'm hungry and thirsty.

417
00:28:48,597 --> 00:28:49,717
Are you kidding?

418
00:28:49,717 --> 00:28:50,877
you just

419
00:28:50,877 --> 00:28:52,217
ate my breakfast.

420
00:28:52,217 --> 00:28:53,236
Shut up.

421
00:29:05,236 --> 00:29:06,476
Good morning, everyone.

422
00:29:07,397 --> 00:29:10,357
Good morning, Miss Xia.

423
00:29:10,357 --> 00:29:11,437
Alright.

424
00:29:11,437 --> 00:29:12,957
Class is starting. Please sit down.

425
00:29:14,996 --> 00:29:16,397
Open your textbooks, please.

426
00:29:16,957 --> 00:29:19,317
Translation is a key point for the exam.

427
00:29:19,317 --> 00:29:20,536
The reason

428
00:29:20,536 --> 00:29:21,817
why you lost marks before

429
00:29:21,817 --> 00:29:25,017
is that there's an issue with the transition

430
00:29:25,017 --> 00:29:26,437
between Chinese and English thinking,

431
00:29:26,437 --> 00:29:27,816
leading to grammatical errors.

432
00:29:27,816 --> 00:29:29,217
Look at this example sentence.

433
00:29:29,217 --> 00:29:31,337
If people don't take action

434
00:29:31,337 --> 00:29:32,496
and adopt effective measures

435
00:29:32,496 --> 00:29:33,597
to protect wild animals,

436
00:29:33,597 --> 00:29:34,877
an increasing number of them

437
00:29:34,877 --> 00:29:35,877
will die out.

438
00:29:35,877 --> 00:29:37,357
How should this sentence be translated?

439
00:29:40,357 --> 00:29:41,472
Shen Juan.

440
00:29:44,036 --> 00:29:45,184
Shen Juan.

441
00:29:50,996 --> 00:29:52,996
How would you translate this sentence?

442
00:30:08,836 --> 00:30:10,497
Don't think that because you have good grades,

443
00:30:10,497 --> 00:30:12,477
you can neglect to listen attentively in class.

444
00:30:12,477 --> 00:30:13,677
Please sit down.

445
00:30:15,357 --> 00:30:17,737
Let me explain.

446
00:30:17,737 --> 00:30:19,877
If people don't take action

447
00:30:19,877 --> 00:30:21,536
and adopt effective measures

448
00:30:21,536 --> 00:30:23,936
to protect wild animals,

449
00:30:23,936 --> 00:30:25,877
an increasing number of them

450
00:30:25,877 --> 00:30:27,156
will die out.

451
00:30:27,156 --> 00:30:28,256
When translating

452
00:30:28,256 --> 00:30:29,717
this kind of texts,

453
00:30:29,717 --> 00:30:31,637
you should pay attention to the use of grammar.

454
00:30:35,917 --> 00:30:37,957
Alright, remember this word.

455
00:30:37,957 --> 00:30:39,637
That's it for today's class.

456
00:30:39,637 --> 00:30:40,992
Class dismissed.

457
00:30:42,756 --> 00:30:46,276
See you, Miss Xia.

458
00:30:46,276 --> 00:30:47,316
See you.

459
00:30:54,796 --> 00:30:56,064
Lin Yujing.

460
00:30:57,036 --> 00:30:58,076
What happened between you two?

461
00:31:10,357 --> 00:31:11,417
Why are you alone?

462
00:31:11,417 --> 00:31:12,556
Where's Juan and Lin Yujing?

463
00:31:15,157 --> 00:31:16,877
They act strange today.

464
00:31:18,917 --> 00:31:20,197
They looked good

465
00:31:20,197 --> 00:31:21,457
at the farm.

466
00:31:21,457 --> 00:31:23,097
The two of them left early.

467
00:31:23,097 --> 00:31:25,437
Please don't mention the farm.

468
00:31:27,437 --> 00:31:28,877
They were like this this morning.

469
00:31:28,877 --> 00:31:31,037
Juan bought Lin Yujing breakfast.

470
00:31:31,037 --> 00:31:32,217
So what?

471
00:31:32,217 --> 00:31:33,217
For the whole morning,

472
00:31:33,217 --> 00:31:35,357
Lin Yujing barely spoke to Juan.

473
00:31:36,316 --> 00:31:37,937
She said something

474
00:31:37,937 --> 00:31:39,717
like, cats behave better than someone.

475
00:31:41,076 --> 00:31:42,417
Did Juan upset her?

476
00:31:42,417 --> 00:31:43,616
Who knows?

477
00:31:44,717 --> 00:31:46,117
They clearly quarreled.

478
00:32:08,236 --> 00:32:10,717
<i>Yesterday, a boy about your age came by.</i>

479
00:32:11,236 --> 00:32:12,337
<i>Did you let him in?</i>

480
00:32:12,337 --> 00:32:13,397
<i>No, we didn't.</i>

481
00:32:13,397 --> 00:32:14,477
<i>Dr. Gu instructed us</i>

482
00:32:14,477 --> 00:32:15,877
<i>not to let strangers in.</i>

483
00:32:15,877 --> 00:32:17,036
<i>Long time no see.</i>

484
00:32:17,717 --> 00:32:19,036
<i>Nie Xinghe.</i>

485
00:33:11,036 --> 00:33:12,288
<i>Are you okay?</i>

486
00:33:49,756 --> 00:33:51,197
What's up?

487
00:33:51,197 --> 00:33:52,577
Do you two

488
00:33:52,577 --> 00:33:53,657
know Nie Xinghe?

489
00:33:53,657 --> 00:33:56,837
What? Nie Xinghe? Where is he?

490
00:33:56,837 --> 00:33:58,157
You've met him?

491
00:33:59,036 --> 00:34:00,437
I ran into him with Shen Juan

492
00:34:00,437 --> 00:34:02,057
when he was stealing in the store.

493
00:34:02,057 --> 00:34:03,557
Who is he exactly?

494
00:34:03,557 --> 00:34:05,717
Why was Shen Juan so mad when he saw him?

495
00:34:06,316 --> 00:34:08,877
So, Juan's hand was not scratched by a cat?

496
00:34:08,877 --> 00:34:10,357
Nie Xinghe hit Shen Juan?

497
00:34:10,357 --> 00:34:11,617
He didn't.

498
00:34:11,617 --> 00:34:14,276
Shen Juan wanted to hit him, but I stopped him.

499
00:34:14,276 --> 00:34:16,036
As a result, Shen Juan punched the mirror.

500
00:34:16,036 --> 00:34:17,317
Why did you stop him?

501
00:34:17,317 --> 00:34:18,697
Nie Xinghe deserved to be beaten.

502
00:34:18,697 --> 00:34:20,597
You heard of Juan's bully rumor, right?

503
00:34:21,157 --> 00:34:22,237
Shen Juan had to repeat a grade

504
00:34:22,237 --> 00:34:23,817
because of Nie Xinghe.

505
00:34:23,817 --> 00:34:25,477
He went to Juan

506
00:34:25,477 --> 00:34:26,597
to provoke him.

507
00:34:26,597 --> 00:34:28,497
That's why Juan hit him.

508
00:34:28,497 --> 00:34:29,597
After that, he played the victim

509
00:34:29,597 --> 00:34:30,737
and made a big fuss

510
00:34:30,737 --> 00:34:31,897
to force the school to punish him.

511
00:34:31,897 --> 00:34:33,077
You saw him, right?

512
00:34:33,077 --> 00:34:35,197
He's fine now, isn't he?

513
00:34:35,197 --> 00:34:36,776
People say he was in a vegetative state

514
00:34:36,776 --> 00:34:38,477
or hospitalized with wounds.

515
00:34:38,477 --> 00:34:39,677
It's all nonsense.

516
00:34:39,677 --> 00:34:40,977
I warn you.

517
00:34:40,977 --> 00:34:42,016
No matter what Nie Xinghe says or does,

518
00:34:42,016 --> 00:34:43,077
you must not believe him.

519
00:34:43,077 --> 00:34:45,097
He just wants Shen Juan to have a hard time.

520
00:34:45,097 --> 00:34:47,036
He's happy for that.

521
00:35:04,388 --> 00:35:07,884
<i>[Peanuts]</i>

522
00:35:24,745 --> 00:35:31,700
<i>[Shen Tiezhu]
[Are you in the store?]</i>

523
00:36:18,677 --> 00:36:19,744
Come in.

524
00:36:44,117 --> 00:36:45,152
Sit.

525
00:36:46,796 --> 00:36:49,117
I just came by to see you.

526
00:37:02,077 --> 00:37:04,997
I've used this medicine. My injury is better.

527
00:37:08,704 --> 00:37:09,796
Give me your hand.

528
00:38:16,836 --> 00:38:17,877
Shen Juan.

529
00:38:17,877 --> 00:38:19,157
Your birthday is coming.

530
00:38:47,077 --> 00:38:48,697
I saw the picture on the wall.

531
00:38:48,697 --> 00:38:50,817
Shen Juan's birthday is November 16th.

532
00:38:50,817 --> 00:38:52,956
It's coming soon. Do you have any thoughts?

533
00:38:54,717 --> 00:38:56,056
You two are good?

534
00:38:56,056 --> 00:38:58,037
You started caring about Juan's birthday.

535
00:38:58,037 --> 00:38:59,717
Could you keep your voice down?

536
00:39:08,756 --> 00:39:10,276
I haven't celebrated my birthday
for many years.

537
00:39:10,276 --> 00:39:12,317
It's different this time.

538
00:39:12,317 --> 00:39:13,737
Your 18th birthday.

539
00:39:13,737 --> 00:39:15,437
After that, you'll be a real man.

540
00:39:15,437 --> 00:39:17,756
Yes, we should celebrate it.

541
00:39:22,037 --> 00:39:23,137
Do you have any ideas?

542
00:39:23,137 --> 00:39:24,637
You come up with an idea, and I'll act on it.

543
00:39:25,356 --> 00:39:27,236
Do you have any thoughts?

544
00:39:30,717 --> 00:39:32,077
If you really want to celebrate,

545
00:39:33,276 --> 00:39:34,577
why don't you all come to the store.

546
00:39:34,577 --> 00:39:36,316
I'll ask my uncle

547
00:39:36,316 --> 00:39:37,557
to make you hot pot.

548
00:39:46,756 --> 00:39:48,000
Catch it.

549
00:39:48,796 --> 00:39:49,984
Pass it to me.

550
00:40:02,836 --> 00:40:03,904
Hi.

551
00:40:05,197 --> 00:40:08,356
Why do we meet here without Juan?

552
00:40:08,356 --> 00:40:09,577
He is not allowed

553
00:40:09,577 --> 00:40:10,796
to attend this meeting.

554
00:40:12,557 --> 00:40:14,117
What's going on?

555
00:40:15,597 --> 00:40:17,097
Shen Juan's birthday is coming.

556
00:40:17,097 --> 00:40:18,296
He's turning 18 years old.

557
00:40:18,296 --> 00:40:19,357
It's an important.

558
00:40:19,357 --> 00:40:20,657
As his friends,

559
00:40:20,657 --> 00:40:22,796
shouldn't we throw him a unique birthday party?

560
00:40:24,637 --> 00:40:25,920
That's it?

561
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:28,116
You can celebrate it for him alone.

562
00:40:28,116 --> 00:40:29,997
- Me?
- Yeah, you.

563
00:40:29,997 --> 00:40:31,837
Stop it.

564
00:40:31,837 --> 00:40:32,936
He's never

565
00:40:32,936 --> 00:40:34,037
celebrated his birthday in the past.

566
00:40:34,037 --> 00:40:35,157
If he's going to celebrate this time,

567
00:40:35,157 --> 00:40:36,637
we have to make up for all the previous ones.

568
00:40:37,236 --> 00:40:38,557
In a word,

569
00:40:38,557 --> 00:40:39,797
we must celebrate it grandly.

570
00:40:39,797 --> 00:40:42,537
A grand celebration, right?

571
00:40:42,537 --> 00:40:44,437
Does Juan know about this?

572
00:40:44,437 --> 00:40:46,816
When we suggested to celebrate his birthday,
he pretended not to hear.

573
00:40:46,816 --> 00:40:48,757
He knew and agreed.

574
00:40:48,757 --> 00:40:50,457
He suggested to eat hot pot in the store.

575
00:40:50,457 --> 00:40:51,744
Really?

576
00:40:52,916 --> 00:40:54,237
You've got some influence.

577
00:40:54,237 --> 00:40:55,537
So, I asked you two here

578
00:40:55,537 --> 00:40:56,776
to discuss it.

579
00:40:56,776 --> 00:40:58,077
We can eat hot pot at any time.

580
00:40:58,077 --> 00:40:59,436
Shouldn't birthdays be a bit special?

581
00:40:59,997 --> 00:41:01,517
We need to think about it.

582
00:41:01,517 --> 00:41:03,497
I had an idea

583
00:41:03,497 --> 00:41:04,517
after pondering it

584
00:41:05,236 --> 00:41:06,457
all night yesterday.

585
00:41:06,457 --> 00:41:07,876
It's quite a surprise.

586
00:41:13,876 --> 00:41:16,677
<i>Shen Juan, help.</i>

587
00:41:18,477 --> 00:41:20,916

00:41:42,916 --> 00:41:44,037
