Water, Little Mushroom.

20
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:47,900
I want water.

21
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:50,560
Here it is. Honey water.

22
00:01:51,744 --> 00:01:53,040
Thank you.

23
00:01:54,719 --> 00:01:56,519
It is good for hangovers. Drink more.

24
00:01:59,079 --> 00:02:01,319
How were you with Shen Juan yesterday?

25
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:05,536
Shen Juan?

26
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,659
Weren't we at the karaoke?

27
00:02:08,659 --> 00:02:10,160
How could I be with him?

28
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,360
You don't remember?

29
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,500
It was a mess last night.

30
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:15,880
Gu Xia

31
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,080
and you got drunk.

32
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:19,060
And you disappeared
while I was taking care of her.

33
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:20,639
In the end, Shen Juan sent you back.

34
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:29,000
<i>Shen Juan.</i>

35
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,260
<i>Why are you ignoring me?</i>

36
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:32,920
<i>Shen Juan, come quickly.</i>

37
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,520
<i>Lin Yujing got drunk.</i>

38
00:02:39,319 --> 00:02:40,360
You forgot everything?

39
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,340
You drank too much last night.

40
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:44,560
You video called Shen Juan.

41
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,840
She even scolded him for you.

42
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:50,719
How could I?

43
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,319
I just said a few words.

44
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:55,400
<i>Shen Juan.</i>

45
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,860
<i>Shen Juan?</i>

46
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:59,560
<i>Wait, I'll play "Are You a Man?" for you.</i>

47
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,639
<i>Are you are a man? I'll play it.</i>

48
00:03:03,639 --> 00:03:04,720
You must know

49
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:05,920
that wasn't a personal attack.

50
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,319
Okay, don't interrupt.

51
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:08,360
The point is,

52
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:10,719
where did you two have been?

53
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,599
<i>Shen Juan.</i>

54
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:16,599
<i>You know what?</i>

55
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:19,960
<i>I really miss you.</i>

56
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,419
When he sent me back yesterday,

57
00:03:25,419 --> 00:03:27,260
what did he say

58
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:28,660
or what was his expression?

59
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:30,000
It was too dark last night.

60
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,120
I don't know.

61
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,840
You really forgot everything?

62
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:42,780
I have to go to class.

63
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:44,560
The honey water is here. Remember to drink it.

64
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,792
Lin Yujing.

65
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,740
Look, he's so handsome.

66
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:11,840
So handsome.

67
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,800
What brought you here?

68
00:04:17,319 --> 00:04:18,759
You don't even call me brother when you see me?

69
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,620
Brother, what brought you here?

70
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:23,600
You texted
that you got into Pucheng University.

71
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,700
Then I got no news from you anymore.

72
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:26,400
Why didn't you tell me you came back?

73
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,319
I know you're very busy.

74
00:04:28,319 --> 00:04:29,480
I had no chance to tell you.

75
00:04:30,319 --> 00:04:31,519
That's your excuse.

76
00:04:34,439 --> 00:04:35,940
I'm going to meet a client nearby.

77
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:38,279
So I drop in on you before that.

78
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:40,260
Brother, there are

79
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:41,780
many different fruits in this world.

80
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:43,120
Don't be picky.

81
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,280
What are you doing?

82
00:04:50,199 --> 00:04:52,720
Don't move.
There's something stuck on your hair.

83
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,680
How about I treat you to a meal?

84
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,020
Didn't I say I'll meet a client later?

85
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:00,220
I'll go back. Bye.

86
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:01,600
Come back.

87
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,360
Strange.

88
00:05:14,816 --> 00:05:15,879
<i>Where are you?</i>

89
00:05:16,519 --> 00:05:18,500
I'm outside. It's not convenient to talk.

90
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,000
I'll hang up first and call you back later.

91
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,880
Look back.

92
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,680
What a coincidence.

93
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:32,759
It's not a coincidence. I'm looking for you.

94
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:39,399
For hangovers.

95
00:05:39,399 --> 00:05:40,800
Thanks.

96
00:05:42,199 --> 00:05:43,340
Little Mushroom told me

97
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:44,560
you sent me back yesterday.

98
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:47,760
I didn't do anything out of line, did I?

99
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,140
I seem to have a blackout.

100
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:50,600
I can't quite remember.

101
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:54,100
You did something to me last night.

102
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:55,360
Impossible. I didn't hit you.

103
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,000
If you can't hold your liquor, drink less.

104
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,040
It affects your memory.

105
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,279
I have something to do. I have to go.

106
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,439
May you avoid me next time.

107
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,180
This place is really nice.

108
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:39,420
How did you find this place?

109
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:41,660
We have a high school classmate
named Wang Yiyang.

110
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:43,280
He likes to make short videos.

111
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,799
Sometimes he visits restaurants.

112
00:06:44,799 --> 00:06:46,180
I saw his video about this place.

113
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:47,299
So I wanted to bring you guys here.

114
00:06:47,299 --> 00:06:49,399
That's interesting. Is he also from our school?

115
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:52,120
His grades were average, so he didn't get in.

116
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,600
But he's with us in the same university town.

117
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,480
How come I've never heard of him from you?

118
00:06:58,759 --> 00:07:00,200
But come to think of it,

119
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,759
I think I've only heard you mention Shen Juan.

120
00:07:03,839 --> 00:07:05,000
Gu Xia also never mentioned him.

121
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,240
Lin Yujing, don't use me as a shield.

122
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:10,020
Can my relationship
with them be the same as yours?

123
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:11,740
Of course it's not the same.

124
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:12,840
Lin Yujing.

125
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,900
Does he have a girlfriend?

126
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:16,288
He doesn't.

127
00:07:20,279 --> 00:07:22,480
How do you know that?

128
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,799
I heard

129
00:07:23,799 --> 00:07:25,220
the girls chasing Shen Juan have lined up

130
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:26,600
from the dormitory door

131
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,720
to the school gate.

132
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,960
If one day,

133
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:31,080
he gets a girlfriend,

134
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,360
you must not regret it.

135
00:07:33,639 --> 00:07:35,920
I wonder

136
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,560
what Shen Juan's type is.

137
00:07:41,439 --> 00:07:42,680
When it comes to love,

138
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,880
only the person involved knows it best.

139
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,160
Eat your food, Little Mushroom.

140
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,240
Don't worry about it.

141
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,620
Let's say,

142
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:58,040
if he has a girlfriend,

143
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,160
will he

144
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,840
be showing off all the time?

145
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:02,304
He won't.

146
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,540
Well,

147
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:06,279
he's not that kind of person.

148
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,340
She just gave an example.

149
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:11,740
The point is,

150
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:12,900
if Shen Juan falls in love,

151
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:14,304
will you be unhappy?

152
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,720
Why would I?

153
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,400
I'd be too happy for him.

154
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,799
If it really happens,

155
00:08:19,799 --> 00:08:22,160
I'll light firecrackers to celebrate for him.

156
00:08:22,759 --> 00:08:23,800
You said it.

157
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,520
We both heard you.

158
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,720
Yeah.

159
00:08:42,679 --> 00:08:43,899
<i>When it comes to love,</i>

160
00:08:43,899 --> 00:08:45,799
<i>only the person involved knows it best.</i>

161
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,808
<i>Are you there?</i>

162
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:12,200
<i>Hey, I have a question. What's your type?</i>

163
00:09:14,105 --> 00:09:16,510
<i>[Lin Yujing]</i>

164
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,799
What's going on?

165
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,080
He Songnan,

166
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,080
I have a question for you.

167
00:09:31,159 --> 00:09:32,160
Suppose

168
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,440
a girl refused you yesterday,

169
00:09:35,104 --> 00:09:36,280
but today she just asked you

170
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:37,940
what your type is.

171
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:38,960
What does she mean?

172
00:09:42,799 --> 00:09:44,479
Why is this person so tangled?

173
00:09:44,479 --> 00:09:45,819
She's fickle,

174
00:09:45,819 --> 00:09:47,000
like the weather.

175
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,960
If she doesn't like you, just say it, right?

176
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:53,679
But, it's not necessarily.

177
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,920
If she really doesn't like you,

178
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,339
she wouldn't ask you about your type.

179
00:09:57,339 --> 00:09:58,920
If that girl really likes you,

180
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:01,519
she might be too embarrassed to admit it.

181
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,100
Why did I

182
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:40,399
ask him this question?

183
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,759
Awesome.

184
00:10:46,759 --> 00:10:47,899
I got

185
00:10:47,899 --> 00:10:49,960
a steak buffet ticket worth 40 yuan.

186
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,020
This is a popular restaurant.

187
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:54,320
There are always a lot of people in line.

188
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,000
Are you guys going with me?

189
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,519
How many tickets did you get?

190
00:10:58,519 --> 00:11:00,360
Three.

191
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,700
So, are you going?

192
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:02,976
I'll go.

193
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,860
Lin Yujing, get up.

194
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:11,120
We'll dress up beautifully and go for food.

195
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,799
Lin Yujing, get up right now.

196
00:11:21,759 --> 00:11:23,600
I feel so good.

197
00:11:28,799 --> 00:11:30,080
<i>May you avoid me next time.</i>

198
00:11:33,039 --> 00:11:34,340
Lin Yujing has got a good appetite.

199
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:35,399
I'll go get you more meat.

200
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,060
Don't. If you eat too much,

201
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:39,360
be careful you don't digest it well later.

202
00:11:39,879 --> 00:11:41,960
No worries.
I'll buy you some yogurt to help digest.

203
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,180
You can still eat?

204
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:44,544
Get the meat.

205
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:10,900
You've been staring at that guy.

206
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:11,979
Why?

207
00:12:11,979 --> 00:12:13,120
Is he your type?

208
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:15,008
No.

209
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:28,720
(No Comment)

210
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,200
You didn't have lunch?

211
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,632
Neither did I.

212
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:43,920
I thought you were full

213
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,440
from looking at handsome guys.

214
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,159
I'll treat you.

215
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:10,679
Did you receive the message
I sent you yesterday?

216
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,879
Do you understand what I mean?

217
00:13:19,039 --> 00:13:20,080
What do you mean?

218
00:13:22,799 --> 00:13:24,100
Never mind, if you don't want to talk about it.

219
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:25,504
Just pretend I didn't ask.

220
00:13:51,399 --> 00:13:53,279
What took Lin Yujing so long to buy yogurt?

221
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:06,740
Why are you guys here?

222
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:08,679
We're here to buy yogurt.

223
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,600
Seems like we came at a bad time.

224
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,559
You need this now, right?

225
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,919
Thank you.

226
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,860
Did you hear that the student union

227
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:36,280
is hosting a freshman basketball game tomorrow?

228
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:38,539
It's the Finance Department
versus the Physics Department.

229
00:14:38,539 --> 00:14:40,280
The Physics Department
has many handsome guys this year,

230
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:41,900
especially Shen Juan.

231
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:42,960
He's really handsome.

232
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:46,220
There's a freshman basketball game tomorrow.

233
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:48,140
Your department is playing
against the Physics Department.

234
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:49,320
Which side do you hope wins?

235
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,320
Well,

236
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,480
The Finance Department, of course.

237
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:52,600
I hope you're not lying.

238
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,680
I'm afraid what you said

239
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:58,380
might hurt someone's feelings.

240
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:00,000
What do you mean?

241
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,200
When I was checking out
at the convenience store,

242
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:04,099
I picked up a bracelet fell out of his pocket.

243
00:15:04,099 --> 00:15:05,480
It's a woman's bracelet.

244
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:16,704
<i>You dropped something.</i>

245
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:20,320
<i>Thank you.</i>

246
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:23,440
Who do you think he's giving it to?

247
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:26,180
Seems like we came at a bad time.

248
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:27,919
We messed up someone's plan.

249
00:15:28,919 --> 00:15:31,000
He's not the kind of guy
who gives gifts to others.

250
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,539
Think about it. If not for you,

251
00:15:33,539 --> 00:15:34,960
who else could he give it to?

252
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:59,180
So handsome.

253
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:01,699
So handsome. So handsome.

254
00:16:01,699 --> 00:16:03,000
So handsome.

255
00:16:04,879 --> 00:16:06,180
He's so cute.

256
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:07,328
So amazing.

257
00:16:15,799 --> 00:16:16,940
Amazing.

258
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:17,980
Yeah, so handsome.

259
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:19,264
He's coming over.

260
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,424
What a coincidence.

261
00:16:24,799 --> 00:16:27,080
I'm playing against your department.
Is that a coincidence?

262
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,240
Shen Juan, the game is about to start.

263
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,336
So handsome.

264
00:16:45,639 --> 00:16:47,559
Don't you want to know why I join this game?

265
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,600
Why?

266
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,320
Because I want

267
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,759
to know who you will cheer for.

268
00:17:01,314 --> 00:17:02,600

Awesome! Go!

290
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:02,480
Little Mushroom,

291
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:03,860
help me out.

292
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:04,960
Which one

293
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,520
looks more mature?

294
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,000
Why do you want to look mature?

295
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,380
It's my dad.

296
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:10,880
He insists on me doing an internship.

297
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,420
Forget about the clothes for now,

298
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:14,640
Look at this post.

299
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:17,472
What's wrong?

300
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:20,256
Look.

301
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:24,199
<i>Shen Juan has a great body.</i>

302
00:19:24,199 --> 00:19:25,880
<i>His basketball moves are great.</i>

303
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:29,359
<i>Girls, I'm going to watch the game.
Who's coming with me?</i>

304
00:19:30,519 --> 00:19:32,660
Has Lin Yujing been there?

305
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:34,279
We have to go support her.

306
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,544
Let's go.

307
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:41,480
Go. Awesome!

308
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:43,319
Go. Awesome!

309
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:51,680
Defense!

310
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:54,880
Good shot!

311
00:19:55,559 --> 00:19:57,439
Lin Yujing, which department
are you cheering for?

312
00:19:57,439 --> 00:19:59,200
Why are you cheering
when the Physics Department scores?

313
00:19:59,799 --> 00:20:01,120
Friendship first, competition second.

314
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:03,000
We should cheer no matter who scores.

315
00:20:03,584 --> 00:20:04,900
Defense!

316
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:06,140
Come on!

317
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:07,456
Defense!

318
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:09,960
Well played.

319
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:12,576
Awesome!

320
00:20:23,712 --> 00:20:24,839
Lin Yujing.

321
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:27,136
Thanks.

322
00:20:27,799 --> 00:20:29,160
It's not for you.

323
00:20:36,079 --> 00:20:37,312
Shen Juan.

324
00:20:40,079 --> 00:20:41,440
That three-pointer just now was amazing.

325
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:45,240
She's Zhu, the school beauty
of the Physics Department.

326
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:48,140
I heard a lot of boys are chasing her.

327
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:49,280
And

328
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,599
she doesn't have a boyfriend.

329
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,579
Look at Shen Juan and Zhu.

330
00:20:52,579 --> 00:20:53,740
What a perfect match.

331
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:55,839
Yeah, older woman-younger man relationships
are in trend now.

332
00:20:58,319 --> 00:20:59,616
I got you water.

333
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,520
Thank you.

334
00:21:06,208 --> 00:21:07,359
Here you go.

335
00:21:09,079 --> 00:21:10,759
This is bad. Let's go.

336
00:21:12,288 --> 00:21:13,480
Lin Yujing!

337
00:21:30,279 --> 00:21:32,640
Sweetie, don't take it out on the bear.

338
00:21:33,279 --> 00:21:34,280
It's just a bottle of water.

339
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:35,720
You can buy him more.

340
00:21:36,279 --> 00:21:37,720
Is this about a bottle of water?

341
00:21:39,136 --> 00:21:40,240
You played well.

342
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:41,400
- Bye.
- Bye.

343
00:21:43,279 --> 00:21:45,740
Shen Juan, can I have your WeChat?

344
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:46,940
Sorry.

345
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:48,039
My girlfriend won't allow it.

346
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:05,960
<i>Let's eat together.</i>

347
00:22:17,759 --> 00:22:19,500
<i>You wanted someone to cheer for you, right?</i>

348
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:21,360
<i>Now you have many girlfriends cheering for you.</i>

349
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:23,680
<i>You go eat with them. I won't disturb.</i>

350
00:22:25,839 --> 00:22:27,008
Are you jealous?

351
00:22:28,039 --> 00:22:29,320
Your affection can't be hidden anymore.

352
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:30,840
What are you talking about?

353
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:32,620
You said you didn't like Shen Juan.

354
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:34,320
So why are you jealous now?

355
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:35,860
I remember when we were eating that day,

356
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:37,080
someone said

357
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:38,780
if Shen Juan started dating,

358
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:40,160
she would set off fireworks to celebrate.

359
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:41,380
Given the current situation,

360
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:42,840
you can start preparing it now.

361
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:44,280
Yeah, I'm jealous.

362
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:46,319
Look how happy he was
when that girl gave him water.

363
00:22:46,319 --> 00:22:47,880
He can't get enough water from her.

364
00:22:50,519 --> 00:22:52,539
With my experience

365
00:22:52,539 --> 00:22:53,799
of watching romance movies,

366
00:22:54,359 --> 00:22:56,519
I can tell you this,

367
00:22:56,519 --> 00:22:57,860
no one can step

368
00:22:57,860 --> 00:22:59,119
between Shen Juan and you.

369
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:01,000
You two were desk mates in high school.

370
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,380
But if you don't

371
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:05,020
express your feelings

372
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:07,240
other girls will

373
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:08,799
take advantage of the situation.

374
00:23:09,599 --> 00:23:10,880
Don't scare her.

375
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:35,712
Hello.

376
00:23:37,759 --> 00:23:39,160
This is fixed. Take a look.

377
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:45,360
Isn't that bracelet the one

378
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,400
that fell out his pocket before?

379
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,860
Can you help me with it?

380
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:49,080
I thought it was a gift for you.

381
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:50,140
Why did he give it to her?

382
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:51,584
Thank you.

383
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,460
<i>You should keep your bracelet safe.</i>

384
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:17,460
<i>Juan stayed up three nights</i>

385
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:18,720
<i>in a row to fix your bracelet.</i>

386
00:24:39,079 --> 00:24:40,579
Has Shen Juan

387
00:24:40,579 --> 00:24:42,440
been really stolen away by her?

388
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:45,279
She's not as pretty as you.

389
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,160
So are we still going out?

390
00:24:49,079 --> 00:24:50,480
It feels a bit awkward to bump into them.

391
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:54,080
Let's not go.

392
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:15,560
<i>Shen Juan, Zhu and you seem close.</i>

393
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:17,620
<i>She gave you water,
and you gave her a bracelet.</i>

394
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:19,160
<i>What's your relationship?</i>

395
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:21,000
<i>Do what you should do.</i>

396
00:25:43,799 --> 00:25:46,359
<i>I have something to say to you.
Meet me downstairs at the dorm.</i>

397
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:13,856
Here you are.

398
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:16,920
What's wrong with you?

399
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:19,400
You didn't answer my calls.
Why are you avoiding me?

400
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:30,440
Come on. I'll take you somewhere.

401
00:26:35,319 --> 00:26:36,440
I have something to say.

402
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:38,848
Let's go.

403
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:13,824
Let's go.

404
00:27:14,425 --> 00:27:17,965
<i>♫ When a ray of light shines in my life ♫</i>

405
00:27:17,965 --> 00:27:21,376
<i>♫ It lights up the direction
where my heart follows ♫</i>

406
00:27:21,376 --> 00:27:24,608
<i>♫ We always have our doubts ♫</i>

407
00:27:24,608 --> 00:27:28,000
<i>♫ But life always needs to set sail ♫</i>

408
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,816
<i>♫ When you sit beside me ♫</i>

409
00:27:30,816 --> 00:27:34,672
<i>♫ Asking me where home is ♫</i>

410
00:27:34,672 --> 00:27:40,411
<i>♫ I point to a star in the night sky ♫</i>

411
00:27:40,411 --> 00:27:47,471
<i>♫ That's where it guides us ♫</i>

412
00:27:50,489 --> 00:27:54,842
<i>♫ You are the weary bird in my palm ♫</i>

413
00:27:54,842 --> 00:27:57,888
<i>♫ I can't bear to let you fly far away ♫</i>

414
00:27:57,888 --> 00:28:00,800
<i>♫ I am the paper boat in your heart ♫</i>

415
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:04,617
<i>♫ And you are my only harbor ♫</i>

416
00:28:04,617 --> 00:28:08,162
<i>♫ Time is the sand
slipping through my fingers ♫</i>

417
00:28:08,162 --> 00:28:10,400
<i>♫ I play the flute of youth ♫</i>

418
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:12,240
Let's go in and have a look.

419
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:14,944
The old place?

420
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,328
Come up.

421
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:29,240
Didn't you say
you've never climbed over the wall?

422
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:39,240
<i>Can you get down from there?</i>

423
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,000
<i>Don't talk about this to others.</i>

424
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,880
<i>Can you be a school bully
if you never climb a wall?</i>

425
00:29:06,359 --> 00:29:08,039
<i>[Scoreboard]</i>

426
00:29:08,039 --> 00:29:09,240
<i>Shen Juan.</i>

427
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:10,960
<i>Is this just okay?</i>

428
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,664
<i>It's okay.</i>

429
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:19,584
Let's go.

430
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:34,464
Look at this.

431
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:55,232
Let's go.

432
00:30:10,176 --> 00:30:11,480
Why are you here?

433
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:12,820
Isn't it your fault?

434
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:14,959
Biology homework requires two people to do.

435
00:30:14,959 --> 00:30:16,419
I can't do it without you.

436
00:30:16,419 --> 00:30:18,079
So I also asked Liu for leave.

437
00:31:20,026 --> 00:31:25,992
<i>♫ Time is a flower of dream ♫</i>

438
00:31:25,992 --> 00:31:31,179
<i>♫ With endless words to say ♫</i>

439
00:31:31,179 --> 00:31:36,956
<i>♫ You waited for me that night ♫</i>

440
00:31:36,956 --> 00:31:42,272
<i>♫ Saying the stars are bright ♫</i>

441
00:31:42,272 --> 00:31:46,759
<i>♫ Love sprouts in my palm ♫</i>

442
00:31:46,759 --> 00:31:50,119
<i>You should help each other. Go on.</i>

443
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:54,680
<i>Our class is good.</i>

444
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:00,240
<i>What are you writing?</i>

445
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:01,480
<i>Extracurricular notes.</i>

446
00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:04,160
<i>You should write more about the class.</i>

447
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:06,839
<i>Your grades have slipped a bit recently.</i>

448
00:32:08,759 --> 00:32:10,319
<i>Put it away. Class will start soon.</i>

449
00:32:10,319 --> 00:32:15,808
<i>♫ I want to become better with you ♫</i>

450
00:32:15,808 --> 00:32:20,723
<i>♫ The youth we shared ♫</i>

451
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:24,820
Remember the boy who stared at you?

452
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:26,319
You kicked his ball away.

453
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:28,480
He shouldn't have a crush on you.

454
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:32,720
<i>♫ I really want to warm you ♫</i>

455
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:39,610
<i>♫ I want to see the most beautiful scenery
with you ♫</i>

456
00:32:39,610 --> 00:32:42,624
<i>♫ We promised ♫</i>

457
00:32:44,130 --> 00:32:49,952
<i>♫ To never be apart ♫</i>

458
00:33:02,106 --> 00:33:07,680
<i>♫ Time is a flower of dream ♫</i>

459
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:13,521
<i>♫ You've already collected it ♫</i>

460
00:33:13,521 --> 00:33:19,025
<i>♫ When we all become better ♫</i>

461
00:33:19,025 --> 00:33:23,771
<i>♫ We'll see the best of the world together ♫</i>

462
00:33:26,079 --> 00:33:27,680
It's quite beautiful here at night.

463
00:33:38,319 --> 00:33:40,180
Actually, since I left here,

464
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:42,080
I've been missing our school days together.

465
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:43,340
So I decided

466
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:45,279
when I had time, I'd come back.

467
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,440
I also wanted to come back.

468
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:50,592
With you.

469
00:33:58,592 --> 00:33:59,720
- I…
- You…

470
00:34:07,319 --> 00:34:08,840
About Zhu's bracelet,

471
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:11,239
He Songnan asked me to fix it for her.

472
00:34:12,039 --> 00:34:13,280
She gave me water

473
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:15,079
to thank me.

474
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:24,599
Actually, I also have something to tell you.

475
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:26,699
I remember what I said

476
00:34:26,699 --> 00:34:30,320
when I was drunk that night.

477
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:33,248
I know.

478
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:36,680
Whatever I'm going to say,

479
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:38,000
don't get mad at me.

480
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,280
I just want to tell you what I'm thinking.

481
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:44,159
Before coming back,

482
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:46,400
I was a little scared.

483
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:50,580
I thought we hadn't seen each other
for a year and a half.

484
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:51,900
I was afraid if we met again,

485
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:53,119
would we feel unfamiliar

486
00:34:53,719 --> 00:34:54,920
or awkward?

487
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:58,440
I have confidence in you,

488
00:34:59,199 --> 00:35:01,760
but I don't have it in myself.

489
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,224
Lin Yujing.

490
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:07,039
Am I that scary?

491
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:13,480
Why is Miss Lin so unconfident now?

492
00:35:19,199 --> 00:35:22,180
You asked me a question before.

493
00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:23,400
I haven't answered you yet.

494
00:35:25,039 --> 00:35:26,599
You asked what my type is.

495
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:30,688
I know my type.

496
00:35:45,199 --> 00:35:46,304
Shen Juan.

497
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:49,000
Well,

498
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,719
do you want a girlfriend?

499
00:35:58,639 --> 00:36:00,400
I mean if you--

500
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:06,760
Confession

501
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:09,400
should be done by me.

502
00:36:16,761 --> 00:36:20,864
<i>♫ The dusk awakens ♫</i>

503
00:36:20,864 --> 00:36:24,352
<i>♫ The slumber of the whales ♫</i>

504
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:27,159
Well, that night,

505
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:29,599
what else did you say to me?

506
00:36:34,528 --> 00:36:35,639
I said…

507
00:36:37,559 --> 00:36:38,800
<i>I miss you too.</i>

508
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:43,000
I miss you too.

509
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:48,320
<i>♫ Happiness and sorrow come and go ♫</i>

510
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:53,920
<i>♫ As my memories dance along the clouds ♫</i>

511
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:59,215
<i>♫ I still remember ♫</i>

512
00:36:59,215 --> 00:37:05,344
<i>♫ Please wait for me at the horizon ♫</i>

513
00:37:05,344 --> 00:37:10,927
<i>♫ We'll watch the sunset together ♫</i>

514
00:37:10,927 --> 00:37:16,559
<i>♫ Whose dream hasn't been beautiful ♫</i>

515
00:37:16,559 --> 00:37:21,519
<i>♫ When have I ever been myself ♫</i>

516
00:37:21,519 --> 00:37:27,712
<i>♫ Wait for me at the end of the daydream ♫</i>

517
00:37:27,712 --> 00:37:33,734
<i>♫ Who has wandered within it ♫</i>

518
00:37:33,734 --> 00:37:39,140
<i>♫ Life is nothing more than fantasy ♫</i>

519
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:44,367
<i>♫ I am still me ♫</i>

520
00:37:54,159 --> 00:37:55,424
Come on.

521
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,280
Your ears are red.

522
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:04,440
The wind is too strong here.

523
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:05,679
It makes my ears read.

524
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:11,320
The wind is indeed strong.

525
00:38:14,199 --> 00:38:17,219
It's getting late. How about I send you back?

526
00:38:17,219 --> 00:38:20,280
No need. The school is quite far from the shop.

527
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:21,679
It would be too much trouble for you.

528
00:38:22,559 --> 00:38:25,359
Your uncle is not worried about you now,

529
00:38:25,359 --> 00:38:26,800
but you should still go home early.

530
00:38:27,679 --> 00:38:30,360
It's fine. He has gone back to his hometown.

531
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:36,760
The shop was closed.

532
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:38,420
I'm living at home now.

533
00:38:38,420 --> 00:38:41,760
Closed? Was business not good?

534
00:38:42,639 --> 00:38:43,760
That's not the reason.

535
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,159
Not long after you left,

536
00:38:51,719 --> 00:38:53,000
Uncle Qinghe passed away.

537
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:57,540
I took a few months off from school.

538
00:38:57,540 --> 00:38:58,639
I closed the shop

539
00:38:59,199 --> 00:39:01,619
and studied hard

540
00:39:01,619 --> 00:39:05,740
to make up missed lessons. Otherwise--

541
00:39:05,740 --> 00:39:06,976
I'm sorry.

542
00:39:09,679 --> 00:39:11,360
But in the future, I'll spend more time

543
00:39:12,239 --> 00:39:13,300
with you to make up

544
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:14,360
for our lost time.

545
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:19,616
Okay.

546
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:23,760
- Say it again, and I'll record it.
- Recording?

547
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:25,119
Yeah, I'll save it.

548
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:28,140
If we ever argue in the future,

549
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:29,440
I'll play it for you.

550
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:30,920
You're thinking about arguing now.

551
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:32,639
If you don't provoke me,
how can I argue with you?

552
00:39:35,199 --> 00:39:36,384
I'm just teasing you.

553
00:39:38,599 --> 00:39:40,719
Don't worry.

554
00:39:41,679 --> 00:39:43,400
I won't give you a chance to argue with me.

555
00:39:44,679 --> 00:39:46,360
You asked me about the score before.

556
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:49,840
I can't compromise on the score,

557
00:39:51,559 --> 00:39:52,639
but in the future,

558
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:55,239
I can compromise

559
00:39:56,639 --> 00:39:57,719
on everything else.

560
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:00,512
Keep your word.

561
00:40:15,199 --> 00:40:16,288
Let's go.

562
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:32,079
- You deserve better.
- Yes.

563
00:40:35,199 --> 00:40:36,960
Lin Yujing, you're finally back.

564
00:40:37,519 --> 00:40:39,239
Hurry, sit down.

565
00:40:39,239 --> 00:40:40,720
You must persuade her.

566
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:42,280
Only you can empathize with her.

567
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:43,559
What happened to her?

568
00:40:43,559 --> 00:40:44,559
She broke up with her boyfriend.

569
00:40:44,559 --> 00:40:46,439
Her boyfriend cheated on her with a senior.

570
00:40:46,439 --> 00:40:47,559
Besides,

571
00:40:47,559 --> 00:40:48,679
you two are

572
00:40:48,679 --> 00:40:50,200
in the same situation.

573
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:51,320
Her ex-boyfriend was also her deskmate

574
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:52,480
in high school.

575
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:53,840
And they're in the same school now.

576
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:55,776
Little Mushroom.

577
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:00,079
Don't be sad.

578
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:02,100
A word of advice.

579
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:03,620
You must stay away from men.

580
00:41:03,620 --> 00:41:06,040
Otherwise, you'll be unhappy.

581
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:07,560
Especially at this time,

582
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:08,780
girls need

583
00:41:08,780 --> 00:41:10,640
to love ourselves more.

584
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:12,039
Isn't that right, Lin Yujing?

585
00:41:14,848 --> 00:41:16,128
Yes.

586
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,559
Don't cry.

587
00:41:20,559 --> 00:41:21,719
Don't cry.

588
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:23,900
Why it happened to me?

589
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:26,199
Why?

590
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:38,720
Deskmate, can I discuss something with you?

591
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:40,064
What did you call me?

592
00:41:42,119 --> 00:41:43,199
Boyfriend.

593
00:41:45,024 --> 00:41:46,360
Go ahead, my girlfriend.

594
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:48,500
Can we keep our relationship

595
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:50,119
a secret for now?

596
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:54,320
<i>My roommate just broke up and is very upset.</i>

597
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:57,559
I'm afraid it will be an irritation to her.

598
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:01,379
Well,

599
00:42:01,379 --> 00:42:03,059
if we don't announce it,

600
00:42:03,059 --> 00:42:07,679
it means we can't hold hands and…

601
00:42:07,679 --> 00:42:08,740
Not exactly.

602
00:42:08,740 --> 00:42:10,919
We can't be open about it at school,

603
00:42:10,919 --> 00:42:12,199
but it's fine in private.

604
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:18,300
If you keep silent, I'll take it as a yes.

605
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:19,320
No, well,

606
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:20,820
there should be a time limit, right?

607
00:42:20,820 --> 00:42:22,120
We can't always be like this.

608
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:23,319
No.

609
00:42:23,319 --> 00:42:24,920
She just broke up.

610
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:26,399
She'll be fine after a while.

611
00:42:26,399 --> 00:42:27,880
Then we can announce it.

612
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:31,719
<i>Don't worry. I won't make you wait too long.</i>

613
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:39,639
<i>You didn't hear me saying I miss you.</i>

614
00:42:40,639 --> 00:42:42,639
<i>Let me say it to you formally again.</i>

615
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:48,239
<i>I miss you, and I like you.</i>

616
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:50,840
<i>I want to be with you.</i>

617
00:43:02,105 --> 00:43:06,649
<i>♫ Love sprouts in my palm ♫</i>

618
00:43:07,961 --> 00:43:11,801
<i>♫ Yet worried linger within my eyes ♫</i>

619
00:43:13,593 --> 00:43:18,169
<i>♫ Our story hasn't ended ♫</i>

620
00:43:19,097 --> 00:43:22,777
<i>♫ So where are we now ♫</i>

621
00:43:24,601 --> 00:43:30,265
<i>♫ I want to hug you so badly ♫</i>

622
00:43:30,265 --> 00:43:34,329
<i>♫ I want to become better with you ♫</i>

623
00:43:35,577 --> 00:43:40,441
<i>♫ The youth we shared ♫</i>

624
00:43:40,441 --> 00:43:46,489
<i>♫ Turned into a rainbow within my heart ♫</i>

625
00:43:47,001 --> 00:43:52,569
<i>♫ I really want to warm you ♫</i>

626
00:43:52,569 --> 00:43:54,457
<i>♫ I want to share with you ♫</i>

627
00:43:54,457 --> 00:43:59,129
<i>♫ The beauty of the world ♫</i>

628
00:44:00,013 --> 00:44:02,233
<i>♫ We promised ♫</i>

629
00:44:02,809 --> 00:44:08,505
<i>♫ To never be apart ♫</i>

630
00:44:09,241 --> 00:44:14,943
<i>♫ Do you want to hear me sing ♫</i>

631
00:44:14,943 --> 00:44:19,705
<i>♫ The wind chime swaying in my heart ♫</i>

632
00:44:20,249 --> 00:44:24,473
<i>♫ Is a wish ♫</i>

633
00:44:25,209 --> 00:44:31,097
<i>♫ I secretly made for you ♫</i>

634
00:44:31,641 --> 00:44:37,177
<i>♫ I want to plant ♫</i>

635
00:44:37,177 --> 00:44:39,065
<i>♫ A red maple forest ♫</i>

636
00:44:39,065 --> 00:44:43,673
<i>♫ To dye the whole mountain red ♫</i>

637
00:44:44,601 --> 00:44:46,841
<i>♫ The sky after the rain ♫</i>

638
00:44:47,481 --> 00:44:52,409
<i>♫ Was painted by our brilliant dreams ♫</i>

639
00:44:59,289 --> 00:45:04,057
<i>♫ Time is a flower of dream ♫</i>

640
00:45:04,889 --> 00:45:09,975
<i>♫ You've already collected it ♫</i>

641
00:45:10,905 --> 00:45:14,905
<i>♫ When we all become better ♫</i>

642
00:45:16,377 --> 00:45:20,505
<i>♫ We'll see the best of the world together ♫</i>
