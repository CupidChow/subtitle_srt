the number of individuals

The concept of population density

is the focus of this topic. Remember this.

30

Population density is one

Come to my office after class.

32

When investigating a population with a smaller distribution range and larger individuals,

33
00:03:39,574 --> 00:03:41,434
you can calculate one by one.

34
00:03:41,434 --> 00:03:44,874

arrange a DIY date on the weekend,

like pottery or digital oil painting.

97
00:07:21,394 --> 00:07:24,213

will eliminate the awkwardness.

00:08:13,014 --> 00:08:15,020
We have to go to school during the day.

113
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:16,673
We can only open in the evenings and weekends.

114
00:08:16,673 --> 00:08:17,856
So we need to attract customers

115
00:08:17,856 --> 00:08:19,533
who have the same free time as us.

116
00:08:19,533 --> 00:08:20,614
I did a little research online.

117
00:08:20,614 --> 00:08:21,834
DIY is pretty popular right now.

118
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:24,553
Like handcrafted pottery, leather goods,
digital oil paintings, etc.

119
00:08:24,553 --> 00:08:26,336
So, we can create a DIY silverware shop.

120
00:08:26,336 --> 00:08:27,734
I think people would be quite interested.

121
00:08:27,734 --> 00:08:29,714
You think.

122
00:08:29,714 --> 00:08:33,394
How confident are you to make such a big move?

123
00:08:33,394 --> 00:08:35,556
"I think" is just a euphemism.

124
00:08:35,556 --> 00:08:37,954
I'm quite confident in my market research.

125
00:08:37,954 --> 00:08:39,234
And when customer traffic increases,

126
00:08:39,234 --> 00:08:41,060
the finished products in the shop will sell.

127
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:44,054
The feasibility analysis is at the end. Take a look.

128
00:08:44,054 --> 00:08:46,953
This looks quite interesting.

129
00:08:46,953 --> 00:08:49,348

130
00:08:58,394 --> 00:09:00,473
I think

131
00:09:02,088 --> 00:09:04,234
we can give it a try.

134
00:09:11,994 --> 00:09:13,553

Feel free to take a look.

181
00:12:53,273 --> 00:12:54,980
Okay.

182
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:57,274
I like this one.

183
00:12:58,433 --> 00:13:00,173
How much is this?

184
00:13:00,173 --> 00:13:01,953
I'm not quite sure about it.

185
00:13:01,953 --> 00:13:04,288
Let me ask the owner for you.

186
00:13:06,673 --> 00:13:08,256
Sorry, this is a display item.

187
00:13:08,256 --> 00:13:09,280
It's not for sale.

188
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:11,872
But she just said we could choose freely.

189
00:13:11,872 --> 00:13:13,376
Why is it not allowed now?

190
00:13:13,376 --> 00:13:16,553
I'm sorry. She's unclear about the situation.

191
00:13:16,553 --> 00:13:19,008
How about this? If you like it, tell me,

192
00:13:19,008 --> 00:13:20,114
and I can make an identical one for you.

193
00:13:20,114 --> 00:13:21,216
But that means we have to wait.

194
00:13:21,216 --> 00:13:22,532
I hate waiting.

195
00:13:22,532 --> 00:13:24,754
I want this ready-made one now.

196
00:13:24,754 --> 00:13:27,234
Besides, if you're not going to sell it,
why display it?

197
00:13:27,234 --> 00:13:29,354
It's not an artwork, right?

198
00:13:29,354 --> 00:13:31,012
Don't beat around the bush.

199
00:13:31,012 --> 00:13:32,073
If you want to increase the price, just say it.

200
00:13:32,073 --> 00:13:33,154
This is not a matter of price.

201
00:13:33,154 --> 00:13:34,313
Sorry.

202
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:36,128
This is my fault for not making it clear.

203
00:13:36,128 --> 00:13:37,514
Would you like to take a look at the others?

204
00:13:37,514 --> 00:13:38,624
We have them in stock.

205
00:13:38,624 --> 00:13:40,773
But I just like this one.

206
00:13:40,773 --> 00:13:42,953
I've told you this can't be sold.

207
00:13:42,953 --> 00:13:44,192
Just refund it.

208
00:13:44,192 --> 00:13:46,316
What's your attitude?

209
00:13:46,316 --> 00:13:49,012
This little shop of yours sells these commonplace things.

210
00:13:49,012 --> 00:13:51,354
You should be grateful that we're willing to buy it.

211
00:13:51,354 --> 00:13:52,576
What did you say?

212
00:13:52,576 --> 00:13:53,728
Say that again.

213
00:13:53,728 --> 00:13:54,793
Shen Juan.

214
00:13:54,793 --> 00:13:56,034
Sorry about that. He's in a bad mood today.

215
00:13:56,034 --> 00:13:57,214
We'll refund you in a bit.

216
00:13:57,214 --> 00:13:59,673
That's all right.

217
00:14:07,553 --> 00:14:09,354
We had a total of eleven customers today.

218
00:14:09,354 --> 00:14:10,368
Only three finished their purchases.

219
00:14:10,368 --> 00:14:11,793
Those two directly got a full refund.

220
00:14:11,793 --> 00:14:12,994
And for some who didn't finish,

221
00:14:12,994 --> 00:14:14,728
we gave them a 50 percent discount.

222
00:14:14,728 --> 00:14:17,514
Didn't we sell some jewelry too?

223
00:14:17,514 --> 00:14:19,584
We sold two necklaces and a ring.

224
00:14:19,584 --> 00:14:21,728
Let me calculate the turnover.

225
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:27,533
2,328.

226
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:30,248
We're still in the red by 107.

227
00:14:30,933 --> 00:14:31,872
But it's not too bad.

228
00:14:31,872 --> 00:14:33,073
If we keep this trend,

229
00:14:33,073 --> 00:14:34,432
we could be profitable tomorrow.

230
00:14:34,432 --> 00:14:35,793
We can't be profitable.

231
00:14:35,793 --> 00:14:38,116
All of tomorrow's appointments were canceled.

232
00:14:38,116 --> 00:14:39,464
Why?

233
00:14:39,464 --> 00:14:41,673
That young couple
who came to the store this afternoon

234
00:14:41,673 --> 00:14:43,428
left us more than a dozen bad reviews.

235
00:14:43,428 --> 00:14:46,434
People who had appointments canceled
after seeing them.

236
00:14:52,394 --> 00:14:53,892
Actually, I'm a bit curious too.

237
00:14:53,892 --> 00:14:57,000
Why can't the items
in the display case be sold?

238
00:14:57,953 --> 00:15:00,004
You don't need to know about that.

239
00:15:00,004 --> 00:15:01,896
I'm not trying to pry.

240
00:15:01,896 --> 00:15:03,872
I just think we're in a partnership,

241
00:15:03,872 --> 00:15:05,073
but you're not telling me anything.

242
00:15:05,073 --> 00:15:08,573
Will there be situations like this
in the future?

243
00:15:08,573 --> 00:15:11,236
Then after all the hustle,
all we get will be bad reviews.

244
00:15:13,484 --> 00:15:14,968
Wang Yiyang,

245
00:15:14,968 --> 00:15:17,056
go put away the things in the case.

246
00:15:17,056 --> 00:15:20,804
Okay, I'll go do it.

247
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:27,552
Don't be mad.

248
00:15:27,552 --> 00:15:29,348
Actually, it's pretty good to put things away.

249
00:15:29,348 --> 00:15:30,688
It solves the problem at the root.

250
00:15:30,688 --> 00:15:31,813
I'm not angry.

251
00:15:31,813 --> 00:15:33,454
I believe in a transparent partnership.

252
00:15:33,454 --> 00:15:36,200
Otherwise, who knows
how many more taboos there are?

253
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:40,756
Thank you for your hard work.

254
00:15:40,756 --> 00:15:42,394
How much should I compensate you?

255
00:15:42,394 --> 00:15:46,033
This partnership is over.

256
00:15:47,114 --> 00:15:49,152
You think it's about money?

257
00:15:49,152 --> 00:15:51,114
I just think after all of us working so hard,

258
00:15:51,114 --> 00:15:53,374
why should we give up?

259
00:15:59,994 --> 00:16:01,994
I'm sorry.

260
00:16:01,994 --> 00:16:04,073
Let's just leave it at that.

261
00:16:05,313 --> 00:16:07,354
It's your own business anyway.

262
00:16:07,354 --> 00:16:08,914
If you don't want to do it,

263
00:16:08,914 --> 00:16:10,552
then let it be.

264
00:16:12,713 --> 00:16:14,524
Lin Yujing,

265
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:36,384
Juan,

266
00:16:36,384 --> 00:16:38,473
how about we set up a stall
at the night market?

267
00:16:38,473 --> 00:16:40,994
Forget it.

268
00:16:40,994 --> 00:16:42,973
He has to take
the college entrance exam this year.

269
00:16:42,973 --> 00:16:45,234
He doesn't have that much time
to spend with us.

270
00:16:45,234 --> 00:16:46,528
You have your own things to do too.

271
00:16:46,528 --> 00:16:48,388
What are you talking about?

272
00:16:48,388 --> 00:16:51,394
The silverware store is everyone's business.

273
00:16:51,394 --> 00:16:54,073
What are you guys discussing?

274
00:16:54,994 --> 00:16:57,412
Discussing how to run the shop. Do you know?

275
00:16:57,412 --> 00:16:58,784
Then you have to tell me first.

276
00:16:58,784 --> 00:17:00,953
What if I know?

277
00:17:00,953 --> 00:17:02,834
Our silverware store
is not doing well right now.

278
00:17:02,834 --> 00:17:04,484
We're trying to find ways to attract customers.

279
00:17:04,484 --> 00:17:06,368
Do you have any ideas?

280
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:11,373
This problem is a bit difficult.

281
00:17:11,373 --> 00:17:14,033
Lin Yujing, help us think, will you?

282
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:16,354
What does it have to do with me?

283
00:17:20,096 --> 00:17:21,084
You guys--

284
00:17:21,084 --> 00:17:22,916
Okay.

285
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:24,192
You drink.

286
00:17:24,192 --> 00:17:27,448
We'll think of something ourselves. Be good.

287
00:17:28,896 --> 00:17:30,594
Juan,

288
00:17:30,594 --> 00:17:33,853
shall we go to see He Songnan at lunch later?

289
00:17:33,853 --> 00:17:36,072
No need to bother.

290
00:17:36,072 --> 00:17:37,474
I did a quick calculation.

291
00:17:37,513 --> 00:17:40,354
I can sell the store's inventory
as raw materials.

292
00:17:40,354 --> 00:17:41,494
It just covers the rent.

293
00:17:41,494 --> 00:17:42,752
Is that okay?

294
00:17:42,752 --> 00:17:45,233
Are you going to stop doing business?

295
00:17:59,454 --> 00:18:01,084
Lin Yujing.

296
00:18:02,212 --> 00:18:03,836
What's up?

297
00:18:04,953 --> 00:18:07,114
We can still be friends.

298
00:18:07,114 --> 00:18:08,734
Don't be so distant.

299
00:18:08,734 --> 00:18:10,432
Why aren't you wearing your bracelet?

300
00:18:10,432 --> 00:18:12,893
Afraid of breaking it again?

301
00:18:12,893 --> 00:18:14,673
You really should take good care of it.

302
00:18:14,673 --> 00:18:17,372
Juan spent three nights repairing it for you.

303
00:18:17,372 --> 00:18:19,136
He didn't need to be so meticulous,

304
00:18:19,136 --> 00:18:20,394
but Juan said

305
00:18:20,394 --> 00:18:22,688
even though he didn't know the special story
behind your bracelet,

306
00:18:22,688 --> 00:18:24,633
he could tell that you cared about it a lot.

307
00:18:24,633 --> 00:18:26,473
It must hold special significance for you.

308
00:18:26,473 --> 00:18:27,794
So Juan put a lot of effort into it,

309
00:18:27,794 --> 00:18:29,632
trying to restore it to its original state,

310
00:18:29,632 --> 00:18:32,513
without any signs of damage.

311
00:18:36,033 --> 00:18:37,354
He's such a person.

312
00:18:37,354 --> 00:18:40,040
Once it comes to silver jewelry, he gets bull-headed.

313
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:42,053
He's got a lot going on too,

314
00:18:42,053 --> 00:18:44,576
so don't take some of his actions to heart.

315
00:18:44,576 --> 00:18:47,993
He didn't ask you about the bracelet, did he?

316
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,424
Okay then.

317
00:18:51,424 --> 00:18:53,673
I'm leaving.

318
00:18:53,673 --> 00:18:56,633
Welcome back to the store for hotpot.

319
00:18:56,633 --> 00:18:58,040
Bye.

Silverware is magical.

347
00:21:23,808 --> 00:21:27,634
It accompanies a person through a long time.

348
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:32,914
Juan, look at this.

349
00:21:36,470 --> 00:21:40,704
Gradually, you will find it's not only a piece of jewelry

350
00:21:40,704 --> 00:21:43,933
but also a box full of countless memories.

351
00:21:43,933 --> 00:21:46,594
This is the philosophy of Qinghe Silverware.

352
00:21:46,594 --> 00:21:50,073
Here, each piece of silver symbolizes some emotion.

353
00:21:50,073 --> 00:21:54,916
Qinghe Silverware is waiting for you to record your story.

354
00:21:57,430 --> 00:21:59,513
This is written by Lin Yujing, right?

355
00:22:10,170 --> 00:22:11,956
Lin Yujing.

356
00:22:14,150 --> 00:22:17,950
We were just about to ask you. Did you write this post?

357
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:21,388

Since it's effective, shall we continue?

359
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:32,156
Of course.

360
00:22:32,156 --> 00:22:37,248
That's great. With the promotional post, we will definitely make a comeback in the later stage.

361
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:43,112
But there's a question. It seems we are running short on silver.

362
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:50,348
How about this? I'll melt down the pieces I made before.

363
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,352
Juan,

364
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:02,940
are you sure?

365
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:20,988
Lin Yujing,

366
00:24:22,150 --> 00:24:23,772
thank you.

367
00:24:27,910 --> 00:24:29,828
You're welcome.

368
00:24:29,828 --> 00:24:34,192
This is my first time hosting such an event. I don't have much experience.

369
00:24:34,192 --> 00:24:36,384
I shouldn't have been so impulsive before.

370
00:24:36,384 --> 00:24:44,252
But then I thought each of these handmade silver ornaments should have its own meaning.

371
00:24:44,252 --> 00:24:50,094
So even if you told me, I might not be able to fully understand, right?

372
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:07,648
It's okay. It's all the same.

373
00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:15,674
Your bracelet is a very old style. It's not something you'd pick for yourself.

374
00:25:15,674 --> 00:25:19,694
It must have been given by someone important.

375
00:25:24,270 --> 00:25:26,513
It was from my mom.

376
00:25:26,513 --> 00:25:29,640
Back then, I just found it ordinary.

377
00:25:30,530 --> 00:25:35,073
But now, it's all I have left.

378
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:44,234
It's getting late. I still have to post. I'm leaving.

379
00:25:44,234 --> 00:25:47,514
- I'll walk you home. 
 - It's okay. I'll just go back by myself.

380
00:25:47,514 --> 00:25:50,113
- Bye. 
 - Take care.

381
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:03,588
I hope it's not the case that no one will come.

382
00:26:03,588 --> 00:26:08,528
That's impossible. The post I made yesterday
had a decent amount of views.

383
00:26:08,528 --> 00:26:10,660
Let's wait a bit longer.

384
00:26:18,230 --> 00:26:21,810
Welcome. Please come in.

385
00:26:22,390 --> 00:26:24,693
Please come in.

386
00:26:46,670 --> 00:26:49,193
This is really ugly.

387
00:26:49,193 --> 00:26:52,800
It seems we have no talent for craftsmanship.

388
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:56,264
It does seem a bit ugly.

389
00:26:56,930 --> 00:26:59,912
I feel like even if I finished it,
you wouldn't wear it. Let's leave then.

390
00:26:59,912 --> 00:27:02,720
I'll buy you one.

391
00:27:03,870 --> 00:27:07,896
Hello, we don't want to do it anymore. Can we get the bill?

392
00:27:07,896 --> 00:27:11,384
Aren't you going to try again? You're almost done. What a pity.

393
00:27:11,384 --> 00:27:13,956
Forget it. We're too clumsy. We can't do it right.

394
00:27:13,956 --> 00:27:17,273
But the things you make yourself have a different meaning.

395
00:27:17,273 --> 00:27:18,904
That's true.

396
00:27:27,810 --> 00:27:30,373
Actually, you guys did pretty well.

397
00:27:31,550 --> 00:27:36,034
Handmade silverware is not about how uniform or perfect the texture is.

398
00:27:36,034 --> 00:27:40,554
What really matters is that it's handmade and unique in the world.

399
00:27:40,554 --> 00:27:44,388
Like this feather. It belongs only to the two of you.

400
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:55,300
How about this? I'll make some minor adjustments and polish it first for you, okay?

401
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:58,092
- Alright. 
 - Okay, this way please.

402
00:28:10,750 --> 00:28:13,314
It really does seem a bit different.

403
00:28:16,090 --> 00:28:17,993
It's quite nice.

404
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,874
Isn't it?

405
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:33,280
<i>[Weekend Artisan]</i>

406
00:28:46,570 --> 00:28:49,813
See yourself out. Bye.

407
00:28:51,710 --> 00:28:55,933
Great, not only did we cover the rent this time, but we also have working capital.

408
00:28:55,933 --> 00:28:59,334
Boss, don't forget me when you get rich. Don't forget my five percent.

409
00:28:59,334 --> 00:29:02,454
What does this have to do with you, and five percent?

410
00:29:02,454 --> 00:29:06,073
I am the founder of the DIY silverware shop. You don't accept that?

411
00:29:07,390 --> 00:29:08,576
Half accepted.

412
00:29:08,576 --> 00:29:10,632
At this rate, we could even start a branch.

413
00:29:10,632 --> 00:29:13,913
Shouldn't we have a feast to celebrate? Your treat.

414
00:29:13,913 --> 00:29:16,048
- I agree. 
 - I agree too.

415
00:29:16,048 --> 00:29:18,573
Sure enough, you're all here.

416
00:29:24,310 --> 00:29:28,600
Mr. Liu, you're here to buy silverware
for your wife, too?

417
00:29:30,910 --> 00:29:33,433
You really think I don't use the Internet?

418
00:29:34,630 --> 00:29:37,060
I know all about everything you do.

419
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:41,780
Should I, perhaps, invite your parents to school

420
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:45,634
and praise you properly in front of them?

421
00:29:45,634 --> 00:29:47,712
Mr. Liu, we know we were wrong.

422
00:29:47,712 --> 00:29:51,260
As students, in class you sleep and play with your phones

423
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:54,614
and do these things unrelated to study
after school.

424
00:29:54,614 --> 00:29:58,092
The monthly exam is coming soon. The other students are all studying hard.

425
00:29:58,092 --> 00:29:59,996
What are you doing?

426
00:30:02,310 --> 00:30:05,528
Stop all these things.

427
00:30:05,528 --> 00:30:09,930
If your grades slip in this monthly exam,

428
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:12,316
let me tell you,

429
00:30:13,590 --> 00:30:17,290
I will invite your parents to school

430
00:30:18,033 --> 00:30:20,833
and tell them everything about you.

431
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:25,774
Aren't you going home yet?

432
00:30:25,774 --> 00:30:29,074
- Mr. Liu.
- Okay, Mr. Liu. W-W-We're sorry.

433
00:30:45,470 --> 00:30:47,793
How do you and Shen Juan perform in grades?

434
00:30:47,793 --> 00:30:49,548
I'm so-so.

435
00:30:49,548 --> 00:30:51,936
So-so. Your words are too broad.

436
00:30:51,936 --> 00:30:56,344
Don't underestimate me. Let me show you the paper I did best.

437
00:30:56,344 --> 00:31:01,293
No need. I'll look at it tomorrow morning. I'm afraid if I look at it now, I'll have nightmares.

438
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:08,194
Oh, right. I forgot to take pictures of the accessories in the shop. I'll go back and take some now.

439
00:31:08,194 --> 00:31:11,954
I'll take advantage of the current popularity to do a second round of publicity. You guys go back first.

440
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:31,753
I have learned a bit

441
00:31:33,710 --> 00:31:35,494
about your family situation.

442
00:31:36,950 --> 00:31:39,513
I had a chat with your dad.

443
00:31:40,910 --> 00:31:45,714
You stay up late at night working for this shop, arrive late to school and sleep in class.

444
00:31:45,714 --> 00:31:47,520
Shen Juan,

445
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:49,334
you're still a child.

446
00:31:49,334 --> 00:31:53,094
Don't put such a heavy burden on yourself.

447
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:03,144
Mr. Liu,

448
00:32:03,144 --> 00:32:06,956
don't worry. I won't neglect my studies.

449
00:32:06,956 --> 00:32:08,832
I'm not only worried

450
00:32:10,290 --> 00:32:13,454
about your studies.

451
00:32:13,454 --> 00:32:16,864
I'm also worried
that your body can't handle it.

452
00:32:27,190 --> 00:32:29,116
Take care of yourself.

453
00:33:16,333 --> 00:33:18,634
<i>You stay up late at night
working for this shop,</i>

454
00:33:18,634 --> 00:33:20,573
<i>arrive late to school and sleep in class.</i>

455
00:33:20,573 --> 00:33:24,188
<i>Shen Juan, you're still a child.</i>

456
00:33:24,288 --> 00:33:25,394
<i>Don't put such a heavy burden on yourself.</i>

457
00:33:25,394 --> 00:33:27,074
<i>on yourself.</i>

458
00:34:34,308 --> 00:34:36,328
Good morning.

459
00:34:37,448 --> 00:34:38,872
Good morning.

460
00:34:52,964 --> 00:34:54,920
I'm leaving.

461
00:35:00,288 --> 00:35:02,633
There's still breakfast in the kitchen.

462
00:35:02,633 --> 00:35:04,300
Aren't you eating?

463
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:05,913
I'm in a rush.

464
00:35:34,653 --> 00:35:36,080
Where's Wang Yiyang?

465
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:37,614
Inside.

466
00:35:47,268 --> 00:35:49,224
Let's go.

467
00:36:07,553 --> 00:36:09,840
Wang Yiyang, let's go.

468
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:11,953
We're going to be late.

469
00:36:36,833 --> 00:36:39,314
Pay attention in class.

470
00:36:41,028 --> 00:36:42,934
The sun is rising in the west.

471
00:36:42,934 --> 00:36:45,800
You're urging others to study.

472
00:36:47,033 --> 00:36:50,354
Aren't you the most serious one in class?

473
00:36:50,354 --> 00:36:51,633
The monthly exam is coming up.

474
00:36:51,633 --> 00:36:54,733
You pay attention to the class and don't hold us back.

475
00:36:54,733 --> 00:36:56,834
Us?

476
00:36:56,834 --> 00:36:58,753
Don't hold us back.

477
00:37:04,996 --> 00:37:06,784
Wang Yiyang,

478
00:37:08,553 --> 00:37:10,633
Wang Yiyang.

479
00:37:20,653 --> 00:37:24,016
You're zoning out in class. Come to the front.

480
00:37:25,553 --> 00:37:28,173
Can I not go there?

481
00:37:28,173 --> 00:37:30,052
Bring your book over.

482
00:37:34,144 --> 00:37:36,174
What are you laughing at?

483
00:37:36,993 --> 00:37:39,453
Wang Yiyang seems strange today.

484
00:37:39,453 --> 00:37:42,693
He probably had a nightmare last night.

485
00:37:42,693 --> 00:37:44,260
You're still wearing your hat in class.

486
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:45,636
Look at the rest of the class.

487
00:37:45,636 --> 00:37:47,674
Who's like you?

488
00:37:47,674 --> 00:37:49,632
Take off your hat.

489
00:37:52,213 --> 00:37:53,888
What's with this mask?

490
00:37:53,888 --> 00:37:55,396
Take off the mask, too.

491
00:37:55,396 --> 00:37:58,648
Turn around and face everyone.

492
00:38:18,686 --> 00:38:21,178
<i>[Eight hours ago]</i>

493
00:38:23,053 --> 00:38:28,380
Folks, today I'll bring you a rap I just learned.

494
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:31,064
Three.

495
00:38:44,352 --> 00:38:47,154
Wang Yiyang, you brat.

496
00:38:47,154 --> 00:38:48,414
You're playing with your phone again.

497
00:38:48,414 --> 00:38:50,774
Can't you read more books?

498
00:38:50,774 --> 00:38:52,053
Look at your room.

499
00:38:52,053 --> 00:38:53,554
What a mess.

500
00:38:53,554 --> 00:38:56,573
Which one of these is related to study?

501
00:38:56,573 --> 00:38:58,693
What era is it now?

502
00:38:58,693 --> 00:39:01,144
It's not only about going to university.

503
00:39:01,144 --> 00:39:04,213
See how much money people can make from an online shop.

504
00:39:04,213 --> 00:39:06,853
And live streaming, becoming a rapper.

505
00:39:07,496 --> 00:39:08,416
Rap what?

506
00:39:08,416 --> 00:39:09,700
Rapper.

507
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:11,073
Rap, do you know?

508
00:39:11,073 --> 00:39:13,156
Come here.

509
00:39:13,156 --> 00:39:14,176
I want to be a rapper.

510
00:39:14,176 --> 00:39:16,993
- Say it again.
- I want to be a rapper.

511
00:39:16,993 --> 00:39:19,633
You brat, how dare you!

512
00:39:20,996 --> 00:39:22,733
Look,

513
00:39:23,253 --> 00:39:25,236
I'm a big boy and he still hits me.

514
00:39:25,236 --> 00:39:27,194
No respect at all.

515
00:39:31,094 --> 00:39:33,574
My pocket money,

516
00:39:33,574 --> 00:39:35,556
my scholarship,

517
00:39:35,556 --> 00:39:38,334
my limited-edition sneakers,

518
00:39:38,334 --> 00:39:41,996
all gone.

519
00:39:43,253 --> 00:39:45,800
For your face. Don't drink.

520
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:48,213
I suggest you focus on the upcoming exam.

521
00:39:48,213 --> 00:39:51,584
If you screw up again, your dad will settle the new and old scores together.

522
00:39:51,584 --> 00:39:54,260
You're going to get a new slap
on the right cheek.

523
00:39:54,260 --> 00:39:56,932
The monthly exam is not all bad.

524
00:39:56,932 --> 00:39:58,112
With the exam, there's a ranking.

525
00:39:58,112 --> 00:40:00,394
With ranking, there's a scholarship.

526
00:40:00,394 --> 00:40:01,856
Don't think about getting into the top ten
in the grade.

527
00:40:01,856 --> 00:40:03,294
But the bottom ten is possible.

528
00:40:03,294 --> 00:40:04,996
There's a scholarship for the monthly exam?

529
00:40:04,996 --> 00:40:07,048
Tell me about it.

530
00:40:08,134 --> 00:40:11,204
In order to encourage students to study hard

531
00:40:11,204 --> 00:40:12,704
and achieve excellent results,

532
00:40:12,704 --> 00:40:14,454
our school has scholarships
for every major exam.

533
00:40:14,454 --> 00:40:15,908
As long as you rank in the top ten
of the grade…

534
00:40:15,908 --> 00:40:17,894
Right, if you rank first in our class,

535
00:40:17,894 --> 00:40:19,173
there's a high probability
of getting a scholarship.

536
00:40:19,173 --> 00:40:21,380
So how many points
does the first place usually get?

537
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:23,633
Do you have the report card from last semester?

538
00:40:23,633 --> 00:40:25,434
Can I take a look at it?

539
00:40:25,434 --> 00:40:27,714
You want a scholarship?

540
00:40:29,668 --> 00:40:32,924
Look, her eyes light up at the mention of money.

541
00:40:32,924 --> 00:40:35,314
She must be after the scholarship.

542
00:40:35,314 --> 00:40:37,860
Who doesn't want a scholarship?

543
00:40:39,456 --> 00:40:41,373
Is there?

544
00:40:41,373 --> 00:40:42,968
There is.

545
00:40:52,654 --> 00:40:56,413
I can still hope to rank first
if I work harder.

546
00:40:58,874 --> 00:41:01,894
Wang Yiyang, your grades are too bad.

547
00:41:01,894 --> 00:41:03,974
You didn't even pass physics.

548
00:41:03,974 --> 00:41:06,112
You had to remind me?

549
00:41:07,553 --> 00:41:09,120
My dad told me

550
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:11,774
if I failed again this semester,

551
00:41:11,774 --> 00:41:13,056
my shoes

552
00:41:13,056 --> 00:41:14,834
and my money

553
00:41:14,834 --> 00:41:17,014
would all be gone.

554
00:41:17,014 --> 00:41:19,168
You're already thinking about defeat
before the battle.

555
00:41:19,168 --> 00:41:20,516
It would be strange if you do well.

556
00:41:20,516 --> 00:41:22,132
I don't want to do well?

557
00:41:22,132 --> 00:41:24,453
Or is it that I can't?

558
00:41:25,220 --> 00:41:29,076
Juan, please help me.

559
00:41:29,076 --> 00:41:31,194
You're asking him?

560
00:41:31,194 --> 00:41:33,214
His name is not even on the list.

561
00:41:33,214 --> 00:41:35,834
How are your grades?

562
00:41:37,314 --> 00:41:40,953
My grades are okay.

563
00:41:40,953 --> 00:41:46,113
Is your first lesson in society learning how to brag?

564
00:41:48,796 --> 00:41:51,433
Here, Li Lin.

565
00:41:56,533 --> 00:41:58,874
Shen, desk mates should stick together,

566
00:41:58,874 --> 00:42:00,356
so we should study together

567
00:42:00,356 --> 00:42:02,412
and make progress together.

568
00:42:02,412 --> 00:42:04,194
Morning, everyone.

569
00:42:04,714 --> 00:42:08,772
Good morning, sir.

570
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:12,344
How are we going to stick together?

571
00:42:12,344 --> 00:42:13,908
Sit.

572
00:42:15,674 --> 00:42:18,433
Let's start the class.

573
00:42:20,772 --> 00:42:23,474
<i>This world is tumultuous and chaotic.</i>

574
00:42:23,474 --> 00:42:25,316
<i>I peek into your pain.</i>

575
00:42:25,316 --> 00:42:27,493
<i>You witness my distress.</i>

576
00:42:27,493 --> 00:42:32,410
<i>I'm glad to be with you to complete this youthful adventure.</i>

577
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:48,052
<i>♫ Love sprouts in my palm ♫</i>

578
00:42:48,964 --> 00:42:53,704
<i>♫ Yet worried linger within my eyes ♫</i>

579
00:42:54,496 --> 00:42:59,972
<i>♫ Our story hasn't ended ♫</i>

580
00:42:59,972 --> 00:43:04,680
<i>♫ So where are we now ♫</i>

581
00:43:05,504 --> 00:43:11,168
<i>♫ I want to hug you so badly ♫</i>

582
00:43:11,168 --> 00:43:16,532
<i>♫ I want to become better with you ♫</i>

583
00:43:16,532 --> 00:43:21,444
<i>♫ The youth we shared ♫</i>

584
00:43:21,444 --> 00:43:27,892
<i>♫ Turned into a rainbow within my heart ♫</i>

585
00:43:27,892 --> 00:43:33,572
<i>♫ I really want to warm you ♫</i>

586
00:43:33,572 --> 00:43:40,960
<i>♫ I want to share with you  The beauty of the world ♫</i>

587
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:50,136
<i>♫ We promised To never be apart ♫</i>

588
00:43:50,136 --> 00:43:55,946
<i>♫ Do you want to hear me sing ♫</i>

589
00:43:55,946 --> 00:44:01,108
<i>♫ The wind chime swaying in my heart ♫</i>

590
00:44:01,108 --> 00:44:12,576
<i>♫ Is a wish I secretly made for you ♫</i>

591
00:44:12,576 --> 00:44:18,180
<i>♫ I want to plant ♫</i>

592
00:44:18,180 --> 00:44:25,568
<i>♫ A red maple forest To dye the whole mountain red ♫</i>

593
00:44:25,568 --> 00:44:34,444
<i>♫ The sky after the rain Was painted by our brilliant dreams ♫</i>

594
00:44:40,292 --> 00:44:45,892
<i>♫ Time is a flower of dream ♫</i>

595
00:44:45,892 --> 00:44:51,078
<i>♫ You've already collected it ♫</i>

596
00:44:51,808 --> 00:44:57,308
<i>♫ When we all become better ♫</i>

597
00:44:57,308 --> 00:45:02,308
<i>♫ We'll see the best of the world together ♫</i>
