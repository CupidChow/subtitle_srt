19
00:01:34,304 --> 00:01:35,488
Where's your application form?

20
00:01:36,603 --> 00:01:37,722
What application form?

21
00:01:39,963 --> 00:01:41,423
You have to fill in this application form

22
00:01:41,423 --> 00:01:43,123
and ask your parent to sign it.

23
00:01:46,603 --> 00:01:47,682
My parent?

24
00:01:47,682 --> 00:01:49,742
Without parental consent,
you're not allowed to live in the dormitory.

25
00:01:49,742 --> 00:01:51,123
Don't you know about it?

26
00:01:54,002 --> 00:01:55,104
Okay.

27
00:02:35,243 --> 00:02:36,704
This case is very important.

28
00:02:36,704 --> 00:02:38,848
But now, the existing evidence is
quite unfavorable to us.

29
00:02:39,562 --> 00:02:42,170
I plan to talk to
the parties involved tomorrow.

30
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:43,770
Help me prepare more materials.

31
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:55,808
What's wrong?

32
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:06,528
Hey, brother.

33
00:03:07,866 --> 00:03:09,086
Just spill it.

34
00:03:09,086 --> 00:03:11,968
Care to spare me a few minutes?

35
00:03:13,664 --> 00:03:14,720
You'll have two minutes.

36
00:03:15,274 --> 00:03:16,994
- You!
- One minute left.

37
00:03:18,522 --> 00:03:20,096
Okay, I'll make it quick.

38
00:03:20,096 --> 00:03:21,248
I want to live on campus,

39
00:03:21,248 --> 00:03:22,304
but I need parental consent.

40
00:03:22,304 --> 00:03:23,362
Can you sign my form? Thanks.

41
00:03:25,842 --> 00:03:26,962
Why don't you ask your dad?

42
00:03:26,962 --> 00:03:28,661
He's not at home.

43
00:03:28,661 --> 00:03:29,982
You can have your dad sign it

44
00:03:29,982 --> 00:03:31,041
and upload a scanned copy.

45
00:03:33,281 --> 00:03:34,282
If I could do that,

46
00:03:34,282 --> 00:03:35,661
I would have done it a long time ago.

47
00:03:35,661 --> 00:03:37,682
Brother, can you sign it?

48
00:03:38,432 --> 00:03:39,488
No.

49
00:03:41,842 --> 00:03:43,962
Don't you want me to move out?

50
00:03:43,962 --> 00:03:46,242
Just sign it, and I'll leave immediately.

51
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,601
That's a different matter.

52
00:03:53,281 --> 00:03:54,521
Your dad is your guardian,

53
00:03:54,521 --> 00:03:56,001
so only he can sign this form.

54
00:03:56,802 --> 00:03:57,902
I don't have the right.

55
00:03:57,902 --> 00:03:59,402
So,

56
00:03:59,402 --> 00:04:00,962
you're not going to help me. Right?

57
00:04:02,161 --> 00:04:03,482
I don't have the right to help you.

58
00:04:03,482 --> 00:04:05,856
Okay then, I won't bother you.

59
00:04:19,322 --> 00:04:21,402
<i>If you won't apply for that scholarship,</i>

60
00:04:21,402 --> 00:04:22,422
<i>can you let me have it?</i>

61
00:04:22,422 --> 00:04:23,701
<i>How do you know I'm not applying?</i>

62
00:04:23,701 --> 00:04:25,202
<i>It's such a good opportunity.</i>

63
00:04:25,202 --> 00:04:26,442
<i>I certainly can't waste it.</i>

64
00:04:26,442 --> 00:04:28,762
<i>Isn't there only one scholarship slot?</i>

65
00:04:28,762 --> 00:04:29,962
<i>How would I have it?</i>

66
00:04:30,481 --> 00:04:32,262
<i>Shen Juan gave up his spot,</i>

67
00:04:32,262 --> 00:04:34,041
<i>so it's yours now.</i>

68
00:04:48,801 --> 00:04:51,282
Shen Juan, I received the scholarship.

69
00:04:51,282 --> 00:04:52,544
Thank you.

70
00:04:52,544 --> 00:04:54,801
You're welcome, Lin Cuihua.

71
00:04:55,642 --> 00:04:56,882
You can use your scholarship

72
00:04:56,882 --> 00:05:00,361
to make your village look fancier.

73
00:05:04,402 --> 00:05:05,801
So, about the monthly exam,

74
00:05:07,041 --> 00:05:08,742
can we consider it settled?

75
00:05:08,742 --> 00:05:10,082
Class, it's time for the lesson.

76
00:05:11,281 --> 00:05:13,202
Please take out your monthly exam papers.

77
00:05:15,161 --> 00:05:17,582
All of you did well in this month's exam,

78
00:05:17,582 --> 00:05:19,402
especially Lin Yujing.

79
00:05:20,281 --> 00:05:22,682
I've already checked everyone's paper.

80
00:05:22,682 --> 00:05:25,382
Most mistakes are from the cloze test.

81
00:05:25,382 --> 00:05:26,582
For example,

82
00:05:29,921 --> 00:05:31,142
this question has four options.

83
00:05:31,142 --> 00:05:33,002
Everyone gets confused easily.

84
00:05:34,121 --> 00:05:35,842
When dealing with this kind of questions,

85
00:05:35,842 --> 00:05:37,241
there's a specific technique.

86
00:05:38,481 --> 00:05:41,361
Firstly, make sure
to read the context carefully

87
00:05:41,361 --> 00:05:42,882
and understand the main idea of the article.

88
00:05:43,681 --> 00:05:45,161
This is the basis for
answering these questions.

89
00:05:46,041 --> 00:05:47,601
When you do your exercises,

90
00:05:48,241 --> 00:05:49,541
if you can't understand
the meaning of an article,

91
00:05:49,541 --> 00:05:50,962
read it several times more.

92
00:05:52,082 --> 00:05:54,481
Your abilities will improve

93
00:05:55,281 --> 00:05:57,442
only if you can answer the questions
after understanding the article.

94
00:05:58,688 --> 00:05:59,776
Secondly,

95
00:06:00,322 --> 00:06:02,681
you should learn more phrases and sentences

96
00:06:03,241 --> 00:06:05,082
and master their collocation.

97
00:06:05,842 --> 00:06:07,241
As you learn more, you'll make fewer mistakes.

98
00:06:08,202 --> 00:06:09,721
Here's a method.

99
00:06:10,656 --> 00:06:11,776
During the exam,

100
00:06:11,776 --> 00:06:14,681
if you really can't decide
which option to choose,

101
00:06:15,562 --> 00:06:18,464
combine the optional choices into the article

102
00:06:19,041 --> 00:06:20,921
and read the context again.

103
00:06:21,882 --> 00:06:24,842
This can help you choose the correct option.

104
00:06:54,481 --> 00:06:55,712
Shen Juan.

105
00:06:58,402 --> 00:06:59,681
My dear deskmate.

106
00:07:02,368 --> 00:07:03,584
Don't be creepy.

107
00:07:04,762 --> 00:07:05,942
Help me out, will you?

108
00:07:05,942 --> 00:07:07,840
Can you help me sign this form?

109
00:07:11,322 --> 00:07:13,792
Lin Cuihua, you are asking for a favor again.

110
00:07:14,762 --> 00:07:15,942
Alas, I was born poor.

111
00:07:15,942 --> 00:07:17,920
My heartless dad doesn't care about me.

112
00:07:18,481 --> 00:07:19,922
So, if you sign for me,

113
00:07:19,922 --> 00:07:21,152
we'll call it even.

114
00:07:23,082 --> 00:07:24,882
Whose name should I sign? Mine?

115
00:07:24,882 --> 00:07:26,181
My dad's, of course.

116
00:07:26,181 --> 00:07:28,041
So you want me to be your dad?

117
00:07:29,281 --> 00:07:31,301
Shen Juan, I'm serious!

118
00:07:31,301 --> 00:07:33,161
Lin Yujing, someone's looking for you.

119
00:08:18,522 --> 00:08:19,541
<i>[Big news!]</i>

120
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:21,962
<i>[We will have an inter-school sports meet
with Puhua next week!]</i>

121
00:08:23,082 --> 00:08:25,702
<i>[Puhua is the best high school in Pucheng.]</i>

122
00:08:25,702 --> 00:08:27,462
<i>[All the talented students in Pucheng]</i>

123
00:08:27,462 --> 00:08:29,042
<i>[are studying in Puhua High School.]</i>

124
00:08:29,042 --> 00:08:31,182
<i>[What's the point of
competing with them on a sports meet?]</i>

125
00:08:31,182 --> 00:08:32,602
<i>[Don't be so pathetic.]</i>

126
00:08:32,602 --> 00:08:34,262
<i>[We have advantages too!]</i>

127
00:08:34,262 --> 00:08:35,842
<i>[I'll find out
what Puhua students are talking about.]</i>

128
00:08:37,641 --> 00:08:39,282
<i>[We'll definitely
win the track and field events this year.]</i>

129
00:08:39,282 --> 00:08:40,801
<i>[Lu Yao can make sure of it.]</i>

130
00:08:40,801 --> 00:08:42,501
<i>[What I'm concerned about now is]</i>

131
00:08:42,501 --> 00:08:44,802
<i>[can Lu Yao break our school record?]</i>

132
00:08:45,601 --> 00:08:46,742
<i>[Of course!]</i>

133
00:08:46,742 --> 00:08:48,561
<i>[Our track and field team is very strong,]</i>

134
00:08:48,561 --> 00:08:50,641
<i>[but since it's an away game,
the conditions might be a bit tough.]</i>

135
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:07,121
<i>This is my friend, Lu Yao.</i>

136
00:09:08,282 --> 00:09:09,442
<i>This is my deskmate, Shen Juan.</i>

137
00:09:17,042 --> 00:09:18,080
Still awake?

138
00:09:18,601 --> 00:09:19,601
I'm going to sleep now.

139
00:09:21,001 --> 00:09:22,321
Don't push yourself too hard.

140
00:09:22,321 --> 00:09:24,562
Rest early.
Don't you have to wake up early tomorrow?

141
00:09:25,562 --> 00:09:27,382
Okay, I will. Rest well.

142
00:09:27,382 --> 00:09:28,448
Lock the door.

143
00:09:28,448 --> 00:09:29,521
Okay.

144
00:09:44,641 --> 00:09:45,682
Everyone, quiet down.

145
00:09:46,202 --> 00:09:47,542
I have an announcement.

146
00:09:47,542 --> 00:09:50,602
You all know about
the sports meet with Puhua, right?

147
00:09:50,602 --> 00:09:53,802
I would like to pick some students
who are good at sports.

148
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,000
Any volunteers?

149
00:09:57,202 --> 00:09:58,661
I'll do long jump.

150
00:09:58,661 --> 00:10:00,288
Then I'll sign up for high jump.

151
00:10:04,992 --> 00:10:06,080
Anyone else?

152
00:10:09,401 --> 00:10:11,822
This is our last sports meet in high school.

153
00:10:11,822 --> 00:10:13,442
I hope everyone can be more enthusiastic.

154
00:10:13,442 --> 00:10:15,222
There are still many slots for
track and field events.

155
00:10:15,222 --> 00:10:16,641
Any volunteers?

156
00:10:18,082 --> 00:10:19,102
I heard that

157
00:10:19,102 --> 00:10:22,202
the athletes from Puhua High School
are all their best ones.

158
00:10:22,202 --> 00:10:23,462
Especially their ace,

159
00:10:23,462 --> 00:10:24,522
Lu Yao.

160
00:10:24,522 --> 00:10:26,282
He's participating in
several track and field events.

161
00:10:26,282 --> 00:10:27,722
If he joins the game, I'll give up.

162
00:10:27,722 --> 00:10:28,802
I won't embarrass myself.

163
00:10:29,842 --> 00:10:30,922
I mean, that's Lu Yao!

164
00:10:30,922 --> 00:10:32,482
Nobody would want to challenge him.

165
00:10:32,482 --> 00:10:34,242
He's a star at Puhua High School.

166
00:10:34,242 --> 00:10:36,522
They said he's a handsome guy with good grades.

167
00:10:36,522 --> 00:10:37,761
He's basically good at everything!

168
00:10:39,721 --> 00:10:42,442
It's okay. You can come to sign up
when you've made up your mind.

169
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,322
Juan,

170
00:10:49,881 --> 00:10:52,022
this is a once-in-a-century duel!

171
00:10:52,022 --> 00:10:53,362
Are you interested?

172
00:10:53,362 --> 00:10:54,941
What's so good about Lu Yao?

173
00:10:54,941 --> 00:10:57,202
We have Shen Juan!

174
00:10:57,202 --> 00:10:59,562
Juan, time to teach them a lesson.

175
00:11:00,448 --> 00:11:01,504
I'm not interested.

176
00:11:02,912 --> 00:11:06,302
When has Juan ever gone to sports field

177
00:11:06,302 --> 00:11:07,922
except when playing basketball
and doing group exercises?

178
00:11:07,922 --> 00:11:10,401
Well, there's no table on the sports field
to let him sleep on.

179
00:11:11,401 --> 00:11:12,702
Are you going to sign up, then?

180
00:11:12,702 --> 00:11:14,142
Go ahead! Come on!

181
00:11:14,142 --> 00:11:15,168
Me?

182
00:11:17,641 --> 00:11:18,761
If Shen Juan signs up, I'll follow him.

183
00:11:34,322 --> 00:11:35,601
Why are you here again?

184
00:11:37,601 --> 00:11:39,322
I'm here to check on your sports field.

185
00:11:40,322 --> 00:11:42,400
Can't you even come up with a new excuse?
You said that last time.

186
00:11:43,881 --> 00:11:45,001
What is it?

187
00:11:45,001 --> 00:11:47,581
Our school is recruiting for
a minority language specialty class.

188
00:11:47,581 --> 00:11:49,562
With your French level,
you can definitely get in.

189
00:11:52,521 --> 00:11:53,681
Our Puhua High School,

190
00:11:53,681 --> 00:11:55,421
is the ace of private schools.

191
00:11:55,421 --> 00:11:56,422
What do you mean?

192
00:11:56,422 --> 00:11:58,080
Do you want me to transfer there?

193
00:11:59,904 --> 00:12:01,042
I already asked them.

194
00:12:01,042 --> 00:12:03,741
This specialty class has a preferential policy.

195
00:12:03,741 --> 00:12:05,801
Not only can you get free accommodation,

196
00:12:05,801 --> 00:12:08,622
but you can also
get a high amount of scholarships

197
00:12:08,622 --> 00:12:10,202
if you can become the top three of your class.

198
00:12:10,202 --> 00:12:11,322
See? If you join this class,

199
00:12:11,322 --> 00:12:13,301
you won't need to worry about
money and accommodation, right?

200
00:12:13,301 --> 00:12:15,232
You'll be out of your dad's control.

201
00:12:17,024 --> 00:12:18,048
Here. Take it.

202
00:12:23,842 --> 00:12:24,902
Who is this boy?

203
00:12:24,902 --> 00:12:26,622
Why isn't he wearing our school uniform?

204
00:12:26,622 --> 00:12:27,902
He's quite handsome, though.

205
00:12:27,902 --> 00:12:29,202
Is he from our school?

206
00:12:29,202 --> 00:12:30,382
How come I've never seen him before?

207
00:12:30,382 --> 00:12:31,424
Do me a favor, will you?

208
00:12:32,042 --> 00:12:34,282
I need a set of uniform.

209
00:12:34,816 --> 00:12:35,842
What do you want to do?

210
00:12:36,601 --> 00:12:37,942
I want to keep a low profile.

211
00:12:37,942 --> 00:12:39,802
You don't want everyone to notice me, right?

212
00:12:40,922 --> 00:12:42,842
Okay, wait here.

213
00:13:12,562 --> 00:13:14,002
That guy is so handsome!

214
00:13:14,002 --> 00:13:15,322
Although you're wearing our school uniform,

215
00:13:15,322 --> 00:13:16,562
you're still quite noticeable.

216
00:13:26,881 --> 00:13:27,982
So why did you want our uniform?

217
00:13:27,982 --> 00:13:30,222
You're not trying to sneak in
and scout us, are you?

218
00:13:30,222 --> 00:13:31,962
I won't collude with the enemy.

219
00:13:32,601 --> 00:13:35,162
Anyway, we'll soon become schoolmates.

220
00:13:35,162 --> 00:13:36,384
I'm not your enemy.

221
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,562
No way. I won't be your schoolmate.

222
00:13:47,481 --> 00:13:48,576
Where's my uniform?

223
00:13:59,802 --> 00:14:01,922
Puhua Admissions Brochure?

224
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:03,922
Why does Lin Yujing have this?

225
00:14:13,888 --> 00:14:15,042
Hold on.

226
00:14:15,042 --> 00:14:16,721
Lin Yujing has just transferred here,
and she's already leaving?

227
00:14:17,856 --> 00:14:18,922
Hey, let me tell you.

228
00:14:18,922 --> 00:14:20,582
Someone is running around the sports field
as fast as lightning.

229
00:14:20,582 --> 00:14:21,722
Looks like he's trained.

230
00:14:21,722 --> 00:14:23,362
I think he's a freshman.

231
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:24,822
What freshman?

232
00:14:24,822 --> 00:14:26,162
Seems like he's from Puhua.

233
00:14:26,721 --> 00:14:28,002
Let's go! Let's go check it out.

234
00:14:28,002 --> 00:14:29,322
Come on! Hurry!

235
00:14:29,881 --> 00:14:30,962
- Let's follow them.
- Wait for me!

236
00:14:30,962 --> 00:14:32,064
Let's go!

237
00:14:39,552 --> 00:14:40,672
Thanks.

238
00:14:41,322 --> 00:14:43,102
You really are here to scout us.

239
00:14:43,102 --> 00:14:45,402
You even showed off in our uniform!

240
00:14:45,402 --> 00:14:46,601
We can't be friends anymore.

241
00:14:47,802 --> 00:14:49,922
Come on. I need to learn about my enemy
before securing the victory.

242
00:14:49,922 --> 00:14:51,522
You saw the game just now.

243
00:14:51,522 --> 00:14:54,560
Your school is far behind mine.

244
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,584
See?

245
00:14:55,584 --> 00:14:56,922
You're wasting your time here.

246
00:14:56,922 --> 00:14:58,842
Well, I'll make this decision for you.

247
00:14:58,842 --> 00:15:00,562
You'll transfer to
Puhua High School right away.

248
00:15:01,216 --> 00:15:02,241
Huh, that's funny.

249
00:15:10,528 --> 00:15:11,802
Hey, my friend. We meet again!

250
00:15:14,241 --> 00:15:15,361
Well, we're not friends.

251
00:15:16,121 --> 00:15:17,521
You look down on our school.

252
00:15:18,162 --> 00:15:19,442
Why would I be friends with you?

253
00:15:20,361 --> 00:15:21,401
Juan is right.

254
00:15:22,121 --> 00:15:24,282
Why is an outsider wandering around our school?

255
00:15:24,842 --> 00:15:25,862
What a show-off.

256
00:15:25,862 --> 00:15:27,322
And why are you wearing our uniform?

257
00:15:29,562 --> 00:15:30,902
Wait, isn't that my uniform?

258
00:15:30,902 --> 00:15:33,322
Uh, I took it. He needs it for a while.

259
00:15:33,322 --> 00:15:34,601
I'll give it back to you after he leaves.

260
00:15:38,496 --> 00:15:40,641
You look quite familiar.

261
00:15:42,368 --> 00:15:43,802
Oh, I remember now.

262
00:15:43,802 --> 00:15:45,301
I've seen your photo.

263
00:15:45,301 --> 00:15:47,061
Aren't you Lu Yao from Puhua High School?

264
00:15:47,061 --> 00:15:48,701
Could you keep it down?

265
00:15:48,701 --> 00:15:50,922
You competed with
our track and field team just now, didn't you?

266
00:15:52,282 --> 00:15:53,402
And you, Lin Yujing!

267
00:15:53,402 --> 00:15:55,441
How could you betray us
and side with the enemy?

268
00:15:55,441 --> 00:15:56,721
Whose side are you on?

269
00:15:59,121 --> 00:16:01,202
I asked Lin Yujing to get me this uniform.

270
00:16:01,202 --> 00:16:03,520
She didn't help me on purpose. Don't blame her.

271
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:06,222
If what I just said is a bit too much,

272
00:16:06,222 --> 00:16:07,421
I apologize.

273
00:16:07,421 --> 00:16:09,262
After all, friendship comes first.

274
00:16:09,262 --> 00:16:11,282
If you feel offended,

275
00:16:11,802 --> 00:16:14,362
I'll treat you to a meal later.

276
00:16:14,362 --> 00:16:17,121
Alright, no need. I'm afraid we might throw up.

277
00:16:17,721 --> 00:16:18,782
You know what?

278
00:16:18,782 --> 00:16:21,322
Winning those guys can't make you a hero.

279
00:16:21,322 --> 00:16:23,241
Our Liying Middle School has more talents.

280
00:16:23,842 --> 00:16:24,962
When the sport meet officially begins,

281
00:16:24,962 --> 00:16:26,062
Juan will…

282
00:16:26,062 --> 00:16:27,264
Juan?

283
00:16:29,001 --> 00:16:31,401
If you're done with your business,
hurry up and leave.

284
00:16:32,682 --> 00:16:33,922
The next time you come,

285
00:16:33,922 --> 00:16:35,802
don't casually judge your friend's school.

286
00:16:38,962 --> 00:16:40,736
And don't make reckless decisions for her.

287
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,592
Alright.

288
00:16:46,592 --> 00:16:50,821
Since you think what I said earlier was unfair,

289
00:16:50,821 --> 00:16:52,402
then I'll see you on the field.

290
00:16:52,402 --> 00:16:55,162
Since this is an inter-school sport meet,

291
00:16:55,682 --> 00:16:59,562
I'd love to see
which of you is worthy to be my opponent.

292
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:07,641
We'll see.

293
00:17:15,961 --> 00:17:18,048
You should probably go. I'll walk you out.

294
00:17:36,042 --> 00:17:37,641
So smelly.

295
00:17:48,881 --> 00:17:50,182
Here we are. I need to go back now.

296
00:17:50,182 --> 00:17:51,296
I have a class later.

297
00:17:55,424 --> 00:17:56,512
Lin Yujing,

298
00:17:58,762 --> 00:18:02,161
I didn't mean to make decisions for you.

299
00:18:02,681 --> 00:18:06,842
I just believe that this is a good opportunity.

300
00:18:06,842 --> 00:18:07,936
So, I don't want you to miss it.

301
00:18:10,562 --> 00:18:11,712
I'll think about it.

302
00:18:13,248 --> 00:18:14,462
Okay, I'm leaving.

303
00:18:14,462 --> 00:18:15,641
- Bye.
- Bye.

304
00:18:34,641 --> 00:18:35,862
Who is this guy? He's amazing!

305
00:18:35,862 --> 00:18:37,042
Is he from our school?

306
00:18:37,681 --> 00:18:39,722
No, he's Lu Yao from Puhua.

307
00:18:39,722 --> 00:18:41,301
Why did he come to our school?

308
00:18:41,301 --> 00:18:42,722
And he was wearing our school uniform.

309
00:18:43,282 --> 00:18:44,802
Could he be here to scout the site in advance?

310
00:18:45,802 --> 00:18:47,522
Class, quiet down, please.

311
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:50,042
Come on. Back to your seats.

312
00:18:50,681 --> 00:18:53,522
I'll talk about
the registration for this sports meet.

313
00:18:53,522 --> 00:18:54,842
Now,

314
00:18:54,842 --> 00:18:56,781
the other events
have almost all been registered for,

315
00:18:56,781 --> 00:18:58,762
except for the men's 3000-meter run.

316
00:18:59,322 --> 00:19:01,562
Our track and field team
has already registered,

317
00:19:01,562 --> 00:19:03,222
but it's still not enough.

318
00:19:03,222 --> 00:19:06,422
So now, each class
must choose someone to sign up for this match.

319
00:19:06,422 --> 00:19:08,224
Any volunteers?

320
00:19:16,042 --> 00:19:18,528
We might lose, but we can't lose our dignity!

321
00:19:18,528 --> 00:19:20,322
If we don't even have someone to participate,

322
00:19:20,322 --> 00:19:21,961
they'll laugh at us.

323
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,560
Shen Juan.

324
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:28,192
- Hello, sir.
- Three…

325
00:19:29,522 --> 00:19:30,822
During the last sports meet,

326
00:19:30,822 --> 00:19:32,682
Lu Yao participated in all the running events.

327
00:19:32,682 --> 00:19:34,162
Come on, guys!

328
00:19:34,162 --> 00:19:35,442
After watching that video just now,

329
00:19:35,442 --> 00:19:37,521
I have to admit that this guy is so talented.

330
00:19:37,521 --> 00:19:38,762
No wonder he's from Puhua High School.

331
00:19:39,762 --> 00:19:41,802
But he was wearing our school uniform.

332
00:19:41,802 --> 00:19:43,122
He must have a close friend in our school.

333
00:19:43,122 --> 00:19:44,401
It must be that person who let him in!

334
00:19:45,042 --> 00:19:46,882
I heard it was a girl.

335
00:19:46,882 --> 00:19:48,761
Well, they must be quite close.

336
00:19:48,761 --> 00:19:50,592
She definitely wants to see Lu Yao win.

337
00:19:53,002 --> 00:19:54,482
Everyone, stop discussing.

338
00:19:55,282 --> 00:19:57,401
You should all consider about it carefully.

339
00:19:58,441 --> 00:19:59,744
If you can do it, don't waste your talent!

340
00:20:00,681 --> 00:20:01,702
Okay?

341
00:20:01,702 --> 00:20:02,816
I'll sign up.

342
00:20:07,264 --> 00:20:09,802
- Why did he suddenly sign up?
- I wonder the same.

343
00:20:09,802 --> 00:20:11,104
I have no idea.

344
00:20:15,282 --> 00:20:18,362
Good! Shen Juan, you represent our class

345
00:20:18,362 --> 00:20:19,961
to participate in
the men's 3000-meter long run.

346
00:20:25,161 --> 00:20:28,032
Don't forget what you said before.

347
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:34,720
Sir!

348
00:20:36,192 --> 00:20:37,361
I'll sign up as well.

349
00:20:38,272 --> 00:20:40,482
Good! Well done.

350
00:20:48,121 --> 00:20:50,401
Wang Yiyang told me that
you signed up for the 3000-meter run.

351
00:20:50,961 --> 00:20:52,742
Aren't you uninterested in sports meet?

352
00:20:52,742 --> 00:20:53,962
Why did you suddenly sign up?

353
00:20:53,962 --> 00:20:55,121
I just want to give it a try.

354
00:20:57,921 --> 00:21:00,928
Could it be because of Lin Yujing?

355
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:29,920
It has nothing to do with her.

356
00:21:33,601 --> 00:21:34,601
What about Lu Yao?

357
00:21:35,201 --> 00:21:36,322
He's almost replacing you now,

358
00:21:36,322 --> 00:21:38,122
becoming the talk of our school.

359
00:21:38,122 --> 00:21:39,582
Even I've heard of it.

360
00:21:39,582 --> 00:21:41,642
He snuck in wearing our school uniform
and dominated the sports field.

361
00:21:41,642 --> 00:21:44,161
The track team has begun
pre-competition training because of him.

362
00:21:49,322 --> 00:21:51,422
You didn't sign up because of this, did you?

363
00:21:51,422 --> 00:21:53,961
You were irritated,
so you decided to compete for your deskmate.

364
00:22:02,842 --> 00:22:03,842
Why aren't you practicing yet?

365
00:22:04,401 --> 00:22:06,082
I've finished running 1500 meters.

366
00:22:06,681 --> 00:22:07,802
I'm almost exhausted.

367
00:22:11,872 --> 00:22:12,962
What are you up to?

368
00:22:12,962 --> 00:22:14,048
Leg stretching.

369
00:22:35,002 --> 00:22:36,320
Have you eaten yet?

370
00:22:41,842 --> 00:22:42,848
Let's eat together.

371
00:22:56,762 --> 00:22:58,061
Is it bad?

372
00:22:58,061 --> 00:22:59,842
No, it's quite delicious.

373
00:23:01,562 --> 00:23:03,042
Okay, have some more, then.

374
00:23:03,722 --> 00:23:06,681
If you can't finish it,
I can only feed it to the cat.

375
00:23:19,681 --> 00:23:21,401
Are you really planning to move out?

376
00:23:24,681 --> 00:23:26,262
I haven't thought it through yet.

377
00:23:26,262 --> 00:23:27,601
Thanks for caring.

378
00:24:04,601 --> 00:24:06,482
<i>[Have you decided to transfer to my school?]</i>

379
00:24:06,482 --> 00:24:08,512
<i>[You can go through the process
after the sports meet is over.]</i>

380
00:24:40,544 --> 00:24:41,641
Shen Juan.

381
00:24:55,042 --> 00:24:57,482
Thank you for signing my form.

382
00:25:06,592 --> 00:25:07,681
Are you going to Puhua?

383
00:25:08,641 --> 00:25:09,722
How did you know?

384
00:25:11,042 --> 00:25:13,002
I saw the Puhua admission brochure.

385
00:25:14,848 --> 00:25:16,002
Lu Yao gave it to you.

386
00:25:24,042 --> 00:25:27,040
Shen Juan, where do you live?

387
00:25:32,288 --> 00:25:33,361
This silverware store?

388
00:25:37,056 --> 00:25:38,080
What about you?

389
00:25:40,401 --> 00:25:41,961
I used to live in Huaicheng.

390
00:25:42,842 --> 00:25:45,641
But now, I don't know.

391
00:25:46,482 --> 00:25:47,802
What about your dad's home?

392
00:25:50,082 --> 00:25:51,121
My dad?

393
00:25:52,842 --> 00:25:55,562
Do you know the feeling of
Harry Potter living at his aunt's house?

394
00:25:58,681 --> 00:26:01,102
Anyway, I just don't want to see my dad.

395
00:26:01,102 --> 00:26:02,562
And I don't want to go to that home.

396
00:26:03,232 --> 00:26:04,762
Can't quite understand, right?

397
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,201
Actually, I can.

398
00:26:14,048 --> 00:26:17,242
Not everyone in the world is
close to their parents.

399
00:26:22,161 --> 00:26:23,541
Anyway, I thought about it.

400
00:26:23,541 --> 00:26:25,262
Going to Puhua can indeed
get me away from my dad,

401
00:26:25,262 --> 00:26:26,752
and I won't have to live off others.

402
00:26:27,361 --> 00:26:29,401
But I haven't decided yet.

403
00:26:38,881 --> 00:26:40,082
If you really want to go,

404
00:26:41,401 --> 00:26:42,681
you only need to make up your mind.

405
00:26:54,881 --> 00:26:57,442
Shen Juan, the sports meet starts tomorrow.

406
00:26:57,442 --> 00:26:58,560
Lin Yujing.

407
00:26:59,441 --> 00:27:00,441
What's wrong?

408
00:27:06,016 --> 00:27:07,322
It's getting late.

409
00:27:08,544 --> 00:27:09,802
I'm going back.

410
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:11,776
See you tomorrow.

411
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,802
See you tomorrow.

412
00:27:31,601 --> 00:27:32,672
<i>Lin Yujing,</i>

413
00:27:34,361 --> 00:27:37,024
<i>will you cheer for me tomorrow?</i>

414
00:27:45,921 --> 00:27:47,882
Puhua, fighting!

415
00:27:47,882 --> 00:27:54,362
Puhua, fighting!

416
00:27:54,362 --> 00:28:00,802
Puhua, fighting!

417
00:28:02,482 --> 00:28:03,742
Come on! Cheer up!

418
00:28:03,742 --> 00:28:05,322
Let's cheer for our class.

419
00:28:06,432 --> 00:28:07,482
Hey, stop chatting!

420
00:28:07,482 --> 00:28:10,002
Here, I'll do it. Hey, you! Stand up!

421
00:28:10,002 --> 00:28:11,040
Get up!

422
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:12,961
Hey, you! Cheer for our athletes. Hurry!

423
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:15,242
- Fighting!
- Come on!

424
00:28:15,808 --> 00:28:17,641
Go, Liying!

425
00:28:17,641 --> 00:28:19,621
Go, go, go!

426
00:28:19,621 --> 00:28:21,622
Go, Liying!

427
00:28:21,622 --> 00:28:24,282
Go. Go for it.

428
00:28:24,282 --> 00:28:26,144
Alas, never mind.

429
00:28:34,121 --> 00:28:37,056
Congratulations to Lu Yao
for winning the men's 1000-meter final.

430
00:28:37,658 --> 00:28:40,128
<i>[Puhua's Ace]</i>

431
00:28:40,128 --> 00:28:42,582
Second place,
Zhao Tianming from Puhua High School.

432
00:28:42,582 --> 00:28:45,082
Third place,
Wang Xiaoqiang from Puhua High School.

433
00:28:46,432 --> 00:28:47,488
Geez!

434
00:28:47,488 --> 00:28:49,842
Puhua High School has dominated
the track and field competition.

435
00:28:49,842 --> 00:28:51,022
What are we still competing for?

436
00:28:51,022 --> 00:28:52,382
Don't be so pathetic.

437
00:28:52,382 --> 00:28:54,342
The competition hasn't even started yet.
How can you be so sure?

438
00:28:54,342 --> 00:28:56,242
We have to do our best!

439
00:28:56,242 --> 00:28:58,361
At least we have to do it for our school!

440
00:28:59,282 --> 00:29:00,782
Well done, Lu Yao. Congratulations.

441
00:29:00,782 --> 00:29:01,862
You're the best.

442
00:29:01,862 --> 00:29:04,722
You're awesome! So cool!

443
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:11,456
Lin Yujing!

444
00:29:12,762 --> 00:29:13,802
He's calling Lin Yujing.

445
00:29:14,562 --> 00:29:15,641
Who is Lin Yujing?

446
00:29:20,448 --> 00:29:21,641
Do they know each other?

447
00:29:31,522 --> 00:29:34,642
<i>The next event is the men's 3000-meter run.</i>

448
00:29:34,642 --> 00:29:36,742
<i>Athletes, please proceed to the check-in area.</i>

449
00:29:36,742 --> 00:29:37,921
Let's go. It's our turn.

450
00:29:40,881 --> 00:29:42,522
Fighting! Do your best!

451
00:29:50,282 --> 00:29:52,361
Everyone, stand up and cheer for them.

452
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:54,802
Fighting!

453
00:29:54,802 --> 00:29:56,482
Go for it! Go!

454
00:29:56,482 --> 00:29:58,382
Go, Liying!

455
00:29:58,382 --> 00:29:59,522
Fighting!

456
00:30:09,762 --> 00:30:11,622
Lu Yao, you just finished the 1000 meters.

457
00:30:11,622 --> 00:30:13,182
Don't push yourself too hard anymore.

458
00:30:13,182 --> 00:30:14,562
Beating them is like a piece of cake.

459
00:30:15,082 --> 00:30:16,401
The first three places are definitely ours.

460
00:30:16,961 --> 00:30:20,041
Exactly. It will be easy to defeat them.

461
00:30:20,041 --> 00:30:22,222
But, after all, this is their school.

462
00:30:22,222 --> 00:30:23,801
Let's not crush their dignity.

463
00:30:23,801 --> 00:30:25,641
Let's give them a chance to prove themselves.

464
00:30:25,641 --> 00:30:27,342
How does that saying go?

465
00:30:27,342 --> 00:30:30,080
Friendship comes first, right?

466
00:30:38,482 --> 00:30:41,602
They're so arrogant.
The competition hasn't started yet.

467
00:30:41,602 --> 00:30:43,202
I'd love to see them lose.

468
00:30:43,202 --> 00:30:44,642
Just face it.

469
00:30:44,642 --> 00:30:46,381
Puhua's track and field team is their ace,

470
00:30:46,381 --> 00:30:48,342
and Lu Yao is the ace among aces.

471
00:30:48,342 --> 00:30:49,362
How can we possibly win?

472
00:30:49,362 --> 00:30:50,862
What if we perform well?

473
00:30:50,862 --> 00:30:52,361
What if we're lucky?

474
00:30:52,921 --> 00:30:55,082
It's not impossible to turn the table.

475
00:30:55,601 --> 00:30:57,322
Our members who are majored in 3000-meter run

476
00:30:57,322 --> 00:30:58,521
are all injured.

477
00:30:58,521 --> 00:30:59,762
Now it's just us.

478
00:30:59,762 --> 00:31:01,282
You think we can turn the table? How?

479
00:31:09,921 --> 00:31:11,042
What should we do, Juan?

480
00:31:13,401 --> 00:31:14,722
If we don't want to lose,

481
00:31:16,042 --> 00:31:17,201
we have to come up with a plan.

482
00:31:18,961 --> 00:31:24,842
Go for it, Liying.

483
00:31:38,002 --> 00:31:40,021
Can't you go back to your lane?

484
00:31:40,021 --> 00:31:41,728
Why are you standing in mine?

485
00:31:42,722 --> 00:31:44,282
You're even in the inner lane!

486
00:31:44,282 --> 00:31:46,401
What's wrong?
Are you going to get first place?

487
00:31:46,921 --> 00:31:48,442
Huh. You were in my lane,
and now you're the one to talk.

488
00:31:48,442 --> 00:31:50,401
- I…
- Yuchen, the competition is starting.

489
00:31:50,401 --> 00:31:51,424
Go to your lane and get ready.

490
00:31:53,121 --> 00:31:54,961
I'll teach you a lesson.

491
00:31:56,441 --> 00:31:58,021
All players, get ready.

492
00:31:58,021 --> 00:32:03,601
Fighting! Go for it!

493
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:08,401
Go! Go!

494
00:32:17,641 --> 00:32:19,682
Wait, what's going on?

495
00:32:19,682 --> 00:32:21,601
How did Wang Yiyang become the first place?

496
00:32:22,401 --> 00:32:25,302
Could it be that
he has improved within a few days?

497
00:32:25,302 --> 00:32:26,562
That can't be.

498
00:32:26,562 --> 00:32:28,842
Why has Shen Juan fallen behind?

499
00:32:42,722 --> 00:32:44,921
Go, Wang Yiyang!

500
00:32:46,161 --> 00:32:47,161
I knew it.

501
00:32:47,161 --> 00:32:49,302
He shouldn't have run that fast
at the beginning!

502
00:32:49,302 --> 00:32:50,842
And now,
he became exhausted before the finish line!

503
00:32:53,322 --> 00:32:55,401
Wang Yiyang, I'll take over.

504
00:33:02,368 --> 00:33:04,242
Look, he's rushing up again.

505
00:33:07,104 --> 00:33:08,192
Go for it, Wang Yiyang!

506
00:33:08,192 --> 00:33:09,504
Go, Wang Yiyang!

507
00:33:09,504 --> 00:33:11,242
Go for it! Go!

508
00:33:11,242 --> 00:33:16,201
Go, Wang Yiyang!

509
00:33:35,842 --> 00:33:39,632
Go, Wang Yiyang!

510
00:33:39,632 --> 00:33:43,201
Go, Wang Yiyang!

511
00:33:44,121 --> 00:33:49,440
Go, Wang Yiyang!

512
00:33:50,208 --> 00:33:51,881
Wang Yiyang, are you okay?

513
00:33:57,401 --> 00:33:58,496
Go for it!

514
00:34:05,056 --> 00:34:07,041
Look, Shen Juan is rushing up.

515
00:34:10,961 --> 00:34:12,262
This should be his strategy.

516
00:34:12,262 --> 00:34:13,502
Strategy?

517
00:34:13,502 --> 00:34:15,062
At the beginning,
Wang Yiyang rushed to the first place,

518
00:34:15,062 --> 00:34:16,302
draining their energy.

519
00:34:16,302 --> 00:34:17,322
Then, Shen Juan could catch up with them.

520
00:34:19,481 --> 00:34:25,521
Go, Shen Juan!

521
00:34:25,521 --> 00:34:29,162
Go, Shen Juan!

522
00:35:07,722 --> 00:35:12,742
Go, Shen Juan!

523
00:35:12,742 --> 00:35:17,742
Go, Shen Juan!

524
00:35:17,742 --> 00:35:21,162
Go, Shen Juan!

525
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,008
<i>Lin Yujing,</i>

526
00:35:32,096 --> 00:35:34,802
<i>will you cheer for me tomorrow?</i>

527
00:35:42,122 --> 00:35:46,336
Go, Shen Juan!

528
00:35:46,336 --> 00:35:52,302
Go, Shen Juan!

529
00:35:52,302 --> 00:35:57,952
Go, Shen Juan!

530
00:35:57,952 --> 00:36:03,242
Go, Shen Juan!

531
00:36:03,242 --> 00:36:06,481
Go, Shen Juan!

532
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:32,064
Congratulations to Shen Juan
from Liying Middle School

533
00:36:32,064 --> 00:36:34,162
for winning the men's 3000-meter long run!

534
00:36:35,602 --> 00:36:37,622
How could Shen Juan have beaten Lu Yao?

535
00:36:37,622 --> 00:36:38,701
Incredible.

536
00:36:38,701 --> 00:36:39,902
He was just lucky.

537
00:36:39,902 --> 00:36:41,282
There's nothing to be surprised about.

538
00:36:41,282 --> 00:36:42,401
What are you talking about?

539
00:36:43,961 --> 00:36:47,520
Juan used to be…

540
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:48,722
Alright, just stop talking.

541
00:36:49,472 --> 00:36:50,496
You need to rest.

542
00:36:53,961 --> 00:36:55,062
Not bad.

543
00:36:55,062 --> 00:36:56,342
I didn't expect you to be so good.

544
00:36:56,342 --> 00:36:58,322
My bad. I underestimated you.

545
00:36:59,001 --> 00:37:00,282
You participated in so many matches in a row,

546
00:37:01,041 --> 00:37:02,162
and still won second place.

547
00:37:02,802 --> 00:37:03,962
You're not bad either.

548
00:37:03,962 --> 00:37:05,202
Next time, when you're at your best,

549
00:37:06,081 --> 00:37:08,441
we'll find a chance to compete again.

550
00:37:09,282 --> 00:37:11,361
Sure. Until next time.

551
00:37:20,096 --> 00:37:21,504
Good job, Yao.

552
00:37:24,128 --> 00:37:25,408
Shen Juan,

553
00:37:25,408 --> 00:37:26,481
thanks.

554
00:37:26,481 --> 00:37:28,032
Shen Juan! You're amazing!

555
00:37:28,032 --> 00:37:30,144
You're so cool.

556
00:37:30,144 --> 00:37:32,162
You won! That was awesome!

557
00:37:33,202 --> 00:37:34,222
Have some water.

558
00:37:34,222 --> 00:37:35,642
Here, have a drink.

559
00:37:39,481 --> 00:37:40,502
You did an excellent job!

560
00:37:40,502 --> 00:37:42,481
You're so good!

561
00:37:43,104 --> 00:37:44,602
Excuse me, let me through.

562
00:37:44,602 --> 00:37:46,162
- Good job!
- You did well!

563
00:38:04,544 --> 00:38:05,600
Thank you.

564
00:38:15,762 --> 00:38:17,762
So you had planned with Wang Yiyang
before the match started.

565
00:38:17,762 --> 00:38:19,322
That's why he ran so fast at the beginning.

566
00:38:21,001 --> 00:38:22,112
You figured it out?

567
00:38:27,648 --> 00:38:28,736
Lin Yujing.

568
00:38:30,912 --> 00:38:32,242
Thank you for cheering for me.

569
00:38:43,521 --> 00:38:45,722
I've already submitted
my accommodation application.

570
00:38:50,921 --> 00:38:52,001
I've made up my mind.

571
00:38:52,561 --> 00:38:53,600
I'm not leaving.

572
00:38:57,762 --> 00:39:00,181
Puhua can indeed
solve my accommodation problem,

573
00:39:00,181 --> 00:39:01,642
and there's also a scholarship.

574
00:39:01,642 --> 00:39:04,122
So, I really did consider
whether to accept this opportunity.

575
00:39:05,162 --> 00:39:07,001
Then why don't you want to leave now?

576
00:39:16,202 --> 00:39:18,222
Because when I first came to Liying,

577
00:39:18,222 --> 00:39:19,921
I found everything here very unfamiliar.

578
00:39:19,921 --> 00:39:21,502
I didn't know anyone.

579
00:39:21,502 --> 00:39:23,441
At that time, I didn't like it here.

580
00:39:23,441 --> 00:39:25,042
But now,

581
00:39:25,042 --> 00:39:26,961
I feel a sense of belonging.

582
00:39:27,682 --> 00:39:30,881
It's a very comforting, very warm feeling.

583
00:39:31,682 --> 00:39:33,481
And I've met a bunch of friends like you all.

584
00:39:34,162 --> 00:39:36,441
So, I want to stay.

585
00:39:41,722 --> 00:39:43,222
The accommodation issue has been resolved.

586
00:39:43,222 --> 00:39:45,222
Xu Ruyi said I could move to their dorm.

587
00:39:45,222 --> 00:39:46,682
I'll move over tonight.

588
00:39:50,202 --> 00:39:51,360
Miss Lin,

589
00:39:55,561 --> 00:39:56,640
I guess,

590
00:39:58,722 --> 00:39:59,840
we'll see more of each other in the future.

591
00:40:31,802 --> 00:40:32,881
Hey, why are you still here?

592
00:40:35,202 --> 00:40:38,561
How's your school transfer decision going?

593
00:40:39,242 --> 00:40:41,001
I've decided. I won't do it.

594
00:40:41,561 --> 00:40:42,862
I know you're trying to look out for me.

595
00:40:42,862 --> 00:40:44,064
But…

596
00:40:44,704 --> 00:40:45,792
I know.

597
00:40:46,961 --> 00:40:49,242
I suggested you transfer before

598
00:40:49,242 --> 00:40:51,232
because I was afraid that
you wouldn't like it here.

599
00:40:52,602 --> 00:40:53,922
But now,

600
00:40:53,922 --> 00:40:55,122
it seems that you're doing just fine.

601
00:40:56,202 --> 00:40:57,322
Why are you still here?

602
00:40:58,802 --> 00:41:00,081
I got off the bus to get some fresh air.

603
00:41:02,282 --> 00:41:05,024
You disappeared after the match.

604
00:41:05,682 --> 00:41:07,872
What's the matter? Are you exhausted?

605
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:10,342
How about we race again?

606
00:41:10,342 --> 00:41:11,342
Sure.

607
00:41:11,342 --> 00:41:12,602
That's enough, both of you!

608
00:41:15,762 --> 00:41:18,521
Maybe I'll invite you to our school
to show you around in a few days.

609
00:41:24,722 --> 00:41:27,441
Don't worry. I won't ask you to transfer again.

610
00:41:29,602 --> 00:41:31,182
Seeing that you've made friends here,

611
00:41:31,182 --> 00:41:32,262
and that you're not being bullied,

612
00:41:32,262 --> 00:41:33,361
I'm relieved.

613
00:41:35,001 --> 00:41:36,561
We should feel lucky that she didn't bully us.

614
00:41:38,041 --> 00:41:41,302
However, I need to warn you guys.

615
00:41:41,302 --> 00:41:43,481
If she gets bullied again in the future,

616
00:41:43,481 --> 00:41:44,682
I will come back.

617
00:41:47,392 --> 00:41:48,416
Don't worry.

618
00:41:49,082 --> 00:41:50,336
We won't give you that chance.

619
00:41:56,122 --> 00:41:58,282
Alright, that's enough. I'm leaving now.

620
00:41:58,921 --> 00:42:00,041
- Bye.
- See you.

621
00:42:06,361 --> 00:42:08,622
See? I told you Juan is awesome.

622
00:42:08,622 --> 00:42:10,501
Next time, he'll suffer such a miserable lost
that he will never show up in Liying again!

623
00:42:10,501 --> 00:42:11,702
Stop babbling.

624
00:42:11,702 --> 00:42:14,001
He's my friend. Let's go.

625
00:42:15,921 --> 00:42:16,921
Alright.

626
00:42:20,242 --> 00:42:22,462
<i>A clear path lies before me.</i>

627
00:42:22,462 --> 00:42:24,081
<i>All I need is to step forward.</i>

628
00:42:24,722 --> 00:42:26,842
<i>The light in your eyes illuminated me,</i>

629
00:42:26,842 --> 00:42:28,602
<i>giving me the strength to face my future.</i>

630
00:42:41,818 --> 00:42:46,362
<i>♫ Love sprouts in my palm ♫</i>

631
00:42:47,674 --> 00:42:51,514
<i>♫ Yet worried linger within my eyes ♫</i>

632
00:42:53,306 --> 00:42:57,882
<i>♫ Our story hasn't ended ♫</i>

633
00:42:58,810 --> 00:43:02,490
<i>♫ So where are we now ♫</i>

634
00:43:04,314 --> 00:43:09,978
<i>♫ I want to hug you so badly ♫</i>

635
00:43:09,978 --> 00:43:14,042
<i>♫ I want to become better with you ♫</i>

636
00:43:15,290 --> 00:43:20,154
<i>♫ The youth we shared ♫</i>

637
00:43:20,154 --> 00:43:26,202
<i>♫ Turned into a rainbow within my heart ♫</i>

638
00:43:26,714 --> 00:43:32,282
<i>♫ I really want to warm you ♫</i>

639
00:43:32,282 --> 00:43:34,170
<i>♫ I want to share with you ♫</i>

640
00:43:34,170 --> 00:43:38,842
<i>♫ the beauty of the world ♫</i>

641
00:43:39,726 --> 00:43:41,946
<i>♫ We promised ♫</i>

642
00:43:42,522 --> 00:43:48,218
<i>♫ To never be apart ♫</i>

643
00:43:48,954 --> 00:43:54,656
<i>♫ Do you want to hear me sing ♫</i>

644
00:43:54,656 --> 00:43:59,418
<i>♫ The wind chime swaying in my heart ♫</i>

645
00:43:59,962 --> 00:44:04,186
<i>♫ Is a wish ♫</i>

646
00:44:04,922 --> 00:44:10,810
<i>♫ I secretly made for you ♫</i>

647
00:44:11,354 --> 00:44:16,890
<i>♫ I want to plant ♫</i>

648
00:44:16,890 --> 00:44:18,778
<i>♫ a red maple forest ♫</i>

649
00:44:18,778 --> 00:44:23,386
<i>♫ To dye the whole mountain red ♫</i>

650
00:44:24,314 --> 00:44:26,554
<i>♫ The sky after the rain ♫</i>

651
00:44:27,194 --> 00:44:32,122
<i>♫ Was painted by our brilliant dreams ♫</i>

652
00:44:39,002 --> 00:44:43,770
<i>♫ Time is a flower of dream ♫</i>

653
00:44:44,602 --> 00:44:49,688
<i>♫ You've already collected it ♫</i>

654
00:44:50,618 --> 00:44:54,618
<i>♫ When we all become better ♫</i>

655
00:44:56,090 --> 00:45:00,218
<i>♫ We'll see the best of the world together ♫</i>
