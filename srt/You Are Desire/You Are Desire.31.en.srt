1
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:11,319
Just wait and see.

2
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:13,159
The car I rented

3
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:14,599
is exceptionally cool.

4
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:16,599
This will definitely be a

5
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:18,599
memorable graduation trip.

6
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:20,239
It's so sunny!

7
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:26,879
Is this what you call cool?

8
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:29,159
This car is truly impressive.

9
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:29,959
Yes, with so many of us,

10
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:31,199
how do you plan to arrange it?

11
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:32,359
Big brother,

12
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:34,279
Where did you get it from?

13
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:35,759
You had this car brought here?

14
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:38,599
I was going to ask you

15
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:39,279
how you managed to talk to

16
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:40,559
the owner of the car shop.

17
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:42,519
I was thinking of getting a seven-seater business car,

18
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:43,399
but the owner insisted

19
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:44,439
that this was the car I wanted.

20
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:47,279
I said I wanted the coolest car.

21
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:47,679
Who would have known

22
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:48,919
he would bring me this?

23
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:50,599
I have an idea.

24
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:01,599
You really are like a brother to me.

25
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:03,439
I've tried to invite you for a meal before,

26
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:04,879
but you kept making excuses.

27
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:06,359
Now, when my wife calls, you come running.

28
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:07,559
Lin Yuqing!

29
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:41,399
We're here!

30
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:44,519
Let's go!

31
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:52,919
This place looks really nice.

32
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:53,599
I think it's even better than the island we went to last time.

33
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:54,639
Wang Yang finally did something reliable for once.

34
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,439
How did you two end up like this?

35
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,079
Ask him.

36
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,079
He insisted on putting sunflowers at the back,

37
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,239
and it messed up my hair.

38
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:13,919
It's all because of you.

39
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,239
You just had to rent some kind of convertible.

40
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,239
Alright, alright.

41
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,519
Stop arguing, you two.

42
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,439
Look!

43
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,719
Let's go, let's have some fun!

44
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,119
Let's go!

45
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:24,999
Let's go!

46
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:47,399
Lawyer Fu.

47
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,479
Why did you splash me?

48
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,199
My brother splashed me.

49
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,399
I'll avenge you.

50
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,119
Looks like I have to join you guys.

51
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:08,879
Don't run!

52
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,519
Wang Yang!

53
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,239
Splashing Wang Yang! Splashing Wang Yang!

54
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,319
What's going on?

56
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,719
You're ganging up on me, huh?

57
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,559
Who told you to rent that convertible?

58
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:56,079
You seem quite comfortable.

59
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,279
Now you know how amazing we are.

60
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:58,839
If you're uncomfortable, just say it.

61
00:03:58,880 --> 00:03:59,879
Don't pretend.

62
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,119
I'm pretty comfortable. You guys go ahead.

63
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,239
It's raining! It's raining! It's raining!

64
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,559
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

65
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:11,279
Big brother,

66
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,439
Wait for me.

67
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,999
Get me out of here!

68
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,479
Is my hair okay?

69
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,319
It's fine.

70
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,359
It's alright.

71
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,879
Is Wang Yang doing okay?

72
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:33,839
What do you think?

73
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,799
Look, a rainbow!

74
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,639
A rainbow after the rain!

75
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:50,959
It's for everyone!

76
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,559
May everyone who sees it have good luck.

77
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,959
Come on, let's take a selfie.

78
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,399
Sure, let's go.

79
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:07,919
What should we have for dinner tonight?

80
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:08,959
The graduation trip planner,

81
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:09,839
how have you arranged it?

82
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,719
I've reserved a barbecue grill

83
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:12,759
at the barbecue restaurant.

84
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:13,759
We'll have a barbecue tonight.

85
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,039
Sounds good.

86
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:15,799
Great!

87
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,039
Then Shen Juan and I will buy the ingredients,

88
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,439
and Ruyi and I will get drinks.

89
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,479
What about us?

90
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,759
Your mission is very important.

91
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:23,679
You'll help me carry

92
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:24,599
the barbecue grill.

93
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,519
I'll go and bring the car over first.

94
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:28,239
Let's go.

95
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:29,119
Let's go, come on.

96
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:29,919
Let's go.

97
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:46,639
We're here.

98
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,559
You guys go ahead.

99
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,919
I'll take a call and join you in a moment.

100
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:56,719
Hello.

101
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,119
May I speak with Miss Gu Xia, please?

102
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,719
Yes, this is she.

103
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,959
This is the Fengtian Law Firm.

104
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,319
I'm sorry to inform you

105
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:04,999
that because you don't have

106
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:06,399
a legal professional qualification certificate,

107
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,639
we're unable to hire you.

108
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,159
We hope there may be an opportunity

109
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,039
to work together in the future.

110
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,359
Alright.

111
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:13,479
Thank you.

112
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:22,599
What's wrong?

113
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:23,519
Nothing.

114
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,599
Let's go upstairs and get the stuff.

115
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:34,839
Let's go, Ruyi.

116
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,919
Let's have a chat.

117
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:40,359
Alright.

118
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:45,719
Come on.

119
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:49,999
Do you remember those sunflowers?

120
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:51,999
Do you still recall

121
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,799
the sunflowers we planted

122
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,319
in the experimental field at the agricultural university?

123
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:56,999
The two I brought today

124
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:57,839
should be their descendants.

125
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,199
I never imagined that

126
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,159
you'd still remember after three years.

127
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:04,199
I've kept those seeds with me.

128
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,959
On my first day at my current job,

129
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,279
I planted them

130
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,119
by the side of my experimental field.

131
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,079
Since then,

132
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,399
have you continued to plant sunflowers?

133
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,639
Yes.

134
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,119
Because they're a symbol

135
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,279
of our mutual understanding.

136
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,079
I'll keep planting them.

137
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:20,559
That's wonderful.

138
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,879
I hope you keep planting

139
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,599
sunflowers.

140
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:32,239
There's something I want to tell you.

141
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,559
My parents hope

142
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:40,239
that I go back to our hometown

143
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,559
They think

144
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,599
the work and life there

145
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,799
might be a bit easier

146
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:04,959
What do you think?

147
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:11,879
Do you want to stay?

148
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,079
Or...

149
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,039
Before...

150
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,199
When I graduated from college,

151
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:32,759
it was you

152
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:36,119
who supported and took care of me,

153
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,399
found a place for me to live,

154
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,639
and gave me advice on daily life.

155
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,519
I've always hoped that one day,

156
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:45,759
I could also be your support.

157
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:47,759
But Ruyi,

158
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:51,639
I respect your decision.

159
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,239
You don't need to consider me.

160
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:57,639
Just follow your heart.

161
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,199
That's all that matters.

162
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:12,479
It's okay.

163
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:14,679
Take your time to think about it.

164
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:16,879
Let's head back for now.

165
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:22,759
Let's go.

166
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:26,159
I'll help you carry it.

167
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:26,839
It's alright.

168
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,519
These four years passed by so quickly.

169
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:36,759
After the graduation trip ends,

170
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:38,919
everyone will go their separate ways.

171
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,279
I really love it when we all gather

172
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,519
and have a lively time together,

173
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:43,719
just like today.

174
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:45,639
But in the future,

175
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,519
I wonder if we'll still have

176
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:52,439
opportunities like this.

177
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,679
After graduation,

178
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:56,639
we'll all go our own ways,

179
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,039
but it doesn't mean

180
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,119
our friendship will end.

181
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:00,599
Everyone will remember

182
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:02,199
these unforgettable memories

183
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:03,839
and the things we did together.

184
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:04,879
Even if in the future,

185
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,159
we have fewer chances to meet,

186
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,239
I believe that

187
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,039
the next time we meet,

188
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,679
it'll be just like today.

189
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,759
There's something

190
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,759
I've always wanted to tell you.

191
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:53,879
You two, stop chatting.

192
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:54,839
Come over and help.

193
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:55,959
Hurry up.

194
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:57,679
Coming.

195
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:58,799
Let's go.

196
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:09,999
We seem to

197
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,279
have one more task to do.

198
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:12,999
We've eaten and had fun,

199
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,079
what else is there to do?

200
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,199
Yell "Hai".

201
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,559
Does anyone still yell "Hai" these days?

202
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,439
Of course!

203
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:19,599
I don't want to delay graduating anymore.

204
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,519
Feels great! Let me try.

205
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,119
I'm passing the bar exam for sure!

207
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,399
I'm getting my lawyer's license!

208
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:39,919
Lose the case, get lost!

209
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:42,839
Get out of the shared apartment!

210
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:44,719
Team Leader Chen, get lost!


211
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,399
I want to join the national team

212
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:48,279
and win the championship.

213
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,239
I hope

214
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,359
to take control of my own life.

215
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,239
And I also hope

216
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:57,839
that everyone's wishes can come true.

217
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:01,439
We

218
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:04,839
have graduated.

219
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:07,399
Let's go catch some jellyfish together.

220
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,759
Let's go!

221
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,519
Just drinking is too boring.

222
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,399
Let's play a game.

223
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:27,679
This one

224
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:29,359
is called Venus Flytrap.

225
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:30,279
We

226
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,559
take turns pressing its teeth.

227
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,199
There's a certain probability

228
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,119
of getting bitten.

229
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,319
If you get bitten,

230
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,359
you draw a card

231
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:37,999
from this deck

232
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,279
to complete the punishment. How about it?

233
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,719
Okay, okay, good.

234
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:41,999
I'll go first.

235
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,239
Wait, wait, wait.

236
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,319
Dance a little for us.

237
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:58,519
How about it?

238
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:01,399
Dance a little, dance a little, dance a little.

239
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,159
Don't cheat!

240
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,239
Dance a little, dance a little.

241
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:03,839
Dance a little.

242
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:04,559
Dance a little, dance a little.

243
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:07,959
Don't laugh, everyone, don't laugh.

244
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:08,799
Don't laugh.

245
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:18,999
Like this, like this, like this.

246
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:19,959
Doesn't count, doesn't count.

247
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,199
A bit longer, a bit longer.

248
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:22,919
Alright, alright, that's enough.

249
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:28,639
Lin Yu Jing, Lin Yu Jing.

250
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:32,239
Drink a mixed drink

251
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:35,359
made by everyone here.

252
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:37,759
I'll go first.

253
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:38,839
What do I drink?

254
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:41,439
Just pour some beer into the mix, alright?

255
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:46,359
Why?

256
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:47,839
I'll drink for her.

257
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:52,759
In this situation now,

258
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:53,399
it reminds me of the time

259
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:54,799
when we played Truth or Dare on the farm.

260
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:55,799
You remember the

261
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:56,959
Devil's Drink you made for me?

262
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,039
At the time, you

263
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,119
deliberately went easy on Xu Ruyi.

264
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,319
You even drank her share of the drink.

265
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,639
You deserved that punishment.

266
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:05,559
If we're going to put it that way,

267
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:06,359
then at that time,

268
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,799
you must have had feelings for Xu Ruyi.

269
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,399
Is that so?

271
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,039
Alright, alright, another one.

272
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:13,839
I'll go first, I'll go first, I'll go first.

273
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:14,359
It's your turn.

274
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,799
Come on, it's your turn, it's your turn.

275
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:16,919
It's your turn.

276
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:23,039
Then I'll draw one for you.

277
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:29,319
Give a heartfelt statement.

278
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:40,519
As for me,

279
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:44,119
I want to be a video blogger.

280
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,119
I don't really like going to those places.

281
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,119
Following a routine

282
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,959
and a systematic

283
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:51,799
way of life

284
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,999
I don't even know if this path

285
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:56,559
is right or not.

286
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:06,239
It's alright, Wang Yiyang.

287
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:09,719
Actually, this year

288
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,079
has been quite tough for me too.

289
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:14,879
I applied to many companies

290
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:16,599
but got rejected from all of them.

291
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,399
I see my classmates around me

292
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:19,399
all finding their paths,

293
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:21,439
while I'm here

294
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,719
having failed the judicial exam.

295
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:26,519
But I believe that I will pass this year.

296
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:27,719
I believe

298
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,359
that you will pass for sure.

299
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,919
Seeing how hardworking and brave you all are,

300
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:41,959
I've made up my mind too.

301
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:43,839
I've decided

302
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,839
to stay in Pucheng.

303
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,999
I will work hard.

304
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,399
I don't want to give up

305
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,559
and go back to my hometown.

306
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,399
Let's all work hard together.

307
00:15:58,800 --> 00:15:59,999
I feel

308
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:01,959
so happy to have met all of you.

309
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:15,039
Let's have a drink together.

310
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:17,199
Come on, come on.

311
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:19,919
To

312
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,039
a bright future,

313
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,399
to a promising journey,

314
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:24,919
to success in exams,

315
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:25,999
smooth sailing,

316
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,159
marching forward boldly,

317
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:28,479
rise, rise, rise,

318
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:29,719
and be on fire!

319
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,199
So here's to

320
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:32,199
each of our shining futures,

321
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,239
sparkling brightly.

322
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,719
Cheers!

323
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,079
Why did you bring me here so early?

324
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:12,999
What's going on?

325
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:15,119
Look ahead.

326
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:17,399
I brought you here

327
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:19,039
because I wanted to show you

328
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:19,959
this lighthouse.

329
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:24,239
Is there something special about it?

330
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:27,919
Follow me.

331
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:38,079
Can you tell me now

332
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:38,879
why you brought me here?

333
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:39,839
I heard that you can see whales

334
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,639
in the sea here.

335
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,519
Is that true or not?

336
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:44,759
Let's wait and see.

337
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:57,759
Actually,

339
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:00,559
I originally wanted to tell you

340
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,359
that I received an offer from Hu Zhongquan's team.

341
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:03,359
Employment notice.

342
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,399
But you'll be working in Huaicheng.

343
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:06,359
I know.

344
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,079
I found out by chance too.

345
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:13,639
About you going to Huaicheng.

346
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:15,599
I understand too.

347
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:17,599
For you,

348
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:18,999
it's a great opportunity.

349
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:21,079
If you don't go,

350
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,319
you'll regret it later.

351
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,639
If you choose to stay in Pucheng,

352
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:28,559
I'll still advise you to go.

353
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:33,799
Do you remember

354
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:35,999
when we were in high school,

355
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:39,039
the time we were apart?

356
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:41,319
You wrote an essay

357
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:42,639
about farewell.

358
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:46,919
I only saw it later,

359
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,159
and then I understood.

360
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:51,679
Farewell

361
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:54,479
is for a better reunion.

362
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:00,999
Actually, being able to meet you

363
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,359
and be with you,

364
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:05,399
I feel like fate

365
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,639
has been kind to me.

366
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:10,439
There's nothing I regret.

367
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,559
I'm giving you this whale necklace

368
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:33,919
hoping you can be like a whale,

369
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:36,239
freely choosing the sky

370
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:37,199
or the ocean.

371
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:39,559
Free and easy,

372
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:41,439
carefree.

373
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:44,239
To do what you want.

374
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:48,759
Our relationship

375
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:51,159
won't become a constraint for you.

376
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,039
Whether you go to Huaicheng in the future

377
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:01,679
or stay in Pucheng,

378
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,279
or go somewhere else,

379
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:05,799
I think it doesn't matter.

380
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:08,359
What's important is

381
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:13,439
that in the end,

382
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:14,959
we'll both come back

383
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,039
to each other.

384
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,279
You're called Shen Juan.

385
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:09,159
What's up?

386
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:13,799
You actually have a cat.

387
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:14,919
It's pretty cute.

388
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:19,679
My real name is Lin Cuihua, actually.

389
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,199
My actual name is

390
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:22,999
Shen Tiezhu.

391
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:31,759
Your birthday is coming up.

392
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:35,719
We don't really need

393
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:36,759
everyone to understand.

394
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,879
As long as the people around you understand.

395
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,399
You even learned how to shoot?

396
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,279
You must be pretty skilled.

397
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,159
You really want to know everything.

398
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:51,319
Only a curious person would want to know.

399
00:21:58,360 --> 00:21:59,359
Happy birthday.

400
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:01,239
Is it still in time for me to make a wish?

401
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:03,159
We both got into Pudong University.

402
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:04,159
Great!

403
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:05,199
Then it's settled.

404
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,759
Four more years as classmates.

405
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:12,919
Eight, seven, six, five.

406
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:17,199
Four, three, two.

407
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,839
Happy New Year.

408
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,199
Lin Yujing.

409
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:24,399
Farewell.

410
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,479
A word always associated with sadness.

411
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:27,319
Helpless, as if enduring a harsh winter

412
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:30,159
Only then do we realize the value of a warm spring.

413
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:32,719
All these little moments

414
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:34,559
That we've never paid attention to

415
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:35,679
Glisten with the touch of farewell.

416
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,799
Do you

417
00:22:38,519 --> 00:22:39,959
need a girlfriend?

418
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:41,479
Confessions like this

419
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,319
Should be my job.

422
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:00,719
The night is just a process.

423
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:01,999
The sun

424
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:03,639
Will always rise.

425
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:01,759
I see

426
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:03,919
The end of my daydreams is you.

427
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,119
From now on, it's all brightness.

428
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,759
You are all I desire

429
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:09,759
and fantasize about.
