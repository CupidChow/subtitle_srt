- Don't.
- with all his talk of rationality.

30
00:02:26,181 --> 00:02:28,421
Don't do that. He's shy. He can't take it.

Our counselor mentioned it to me.

38
00:02:50,221 --> 00:02:52,181
Students ranked in the top five
in our major have to enter.

The Finance Department is the crown jewel
of our university.

41
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:58,860
This is definitely

42
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:00,820
the cream of the crop.

43

A teacher from the Sports School talked to me
a few days ago.

65
00:05:54,221 --> 00:05:56,701
The school is very satisfied
with our performance in the competition.

66
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:59,340
As the captain,

67
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:01,661
I was given a postgraduate place
in the Sports School.

68
00:06:03,981 --> 00:06:05,181
If I accept, I have to go there

69
00:06:06,221 --> 00:06:07,701
as soon as I graduate in the fourth year,

70
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:11,221
and I can't touch a gun anymore.

71
00:06:15,741 --> 00:06:16,781
So,

72
00:06:18,461 --> 00:06:19,501
you've already made up your mind.

73
00:06:23,661 --> 00:06:24,685
I accepted.

74
00:06:27,949 --> 00:06:28,997
It was my choice.

75
00:06:29,949 --> 00:06:31,028
There's nothing to regret.

00:06:44,629 --> 00:06:46,389
I've been on our shooting team for three years.

77
00:06:47,709 --> 00:06:48,805
I can say without shame

78
00:06:49,869 --> 00:06:50,981
that I've done my best.

79
00:06:54,949 --> 00:06:56,389
But I haven't won

80
00:06:56,389 --> 00:06:58,268
a single individual medal.

81
00:07:04,869 --> 00:07:06,228
I see my limits.

82
00:07:08,109 --> 00:07:09,109
I think it's important

83
00:07:09,828 --> 00:07:10,949
for a person to know themselves.

84
00:07:12,629 --> 00:07:13,869
Rather than hanging on
to the competitive field,

85
00:07:15,709 --> 00:07:16,988
why don't I start on a new path?

86
00:07:26,149 --> 00:07:28,069
Do you look down on me?

87
00:07:28,069 --> 00:07:29,093
Do you think

88
00:07:30,068 --> 00:07:31,141
that I'm getting cold feet?

89
00:07:38,629 --> 00:07:39,869
We're both athletes.

90
00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:42,869
The field is like a battlefield.

92
00:07:46,909 --> 00:07:48,228

I know I was right about you.

97
00:08:07,468 --> 00:08:09,289
My biggest regret

98
00:08:09,289 --> 00:08:10,949
is not leading our shooting team
to win a gold medal.

99
00:08:12,748 --> 00:08:14,028
But in the coming year,

100
00:08:14,028 --> 00:08:15,349
there will be no team competitions.

101

00:08:18,988 --> 00:08:20,969
the heavy responsibility

103
00:08:20,969 --> 00:08:22,268

117
00:10:05,749 --> 00:10:07,008

00:10:17,889 --> 00:10:19,909

124
00:10:19,909 --> 00:10:21,429
that I translated some cases
for my senior Wang Han?

125
00:10:22,548 --> 00:10:24,089
She did one of those,

126
00:10:24,089 --> 00:10:25,908
in which a company

127
00:10:25,908 --> 00:10:27,689
being besieged by several industry giants

128
00:10:27,689 --> 00:10:28,869
and about to go bankrupt

129
00:10:29,429 --> 00:10:30,869
made a great comeback

130
00:10:30,869 --> 00:10:32,429
all because of her brilliant idea.

131
00:10:32,429 --> 00:10:33,788
I was so impressed when I read it.

132
00:10:35,228 --> 00:10:37,149
And after reading this autobiography,

133
00:10:37,788 --> 00:10:39,709
I found out
she was actually a very bold person.

134
00:10:40,709 --> 00:10:42,309
She didn't major in marketing at first.

135
00:10:42,309 --> 00:10:43,709
She was a computer science major.

136
00:10:44,349 --> 00:10:45,629
She had no one around to support her
when she decided to quit school

137
00:10:45,629 --> 00:10:47,309
and retake her exams.

138
00:10:47,309 --> 00:10:48,849
But she still withstood the pressure

139
00:10:48,849 --> 00:10:50,449
and pursued her dream.

140
00:10:50,449 --> 00:10:52,268
It seems she has become your idol,

141
00:10:53,429 --> 00:10:54,828
Sort of.

142
00:10:54,828 --> 00:10:56,669
She'll give a lecture at our school on Friday.

143

Let's go.

164
00:13:08,709 --> 00:13:10,829

169
00:13:58,189 --> 00:13:59,237
Let me.

170
00:14:19,828 --> 00:14:20,837
Whales

To touch the sky,

175
00:14:31,629 --> 00:14:32,949
they can leap out of the water.

176
00:14:34,589 --> 00:14:36,428
No matter how much energy it consumes,

177
00:14:36,428 --> 00:14:37,748
it's worth it.

178
00:14:39,589 --> 00:14:40,669

00:15:02,148 --> 00:15:03,869
So there's nothing to be confused about.

187
00:15:04,668 --> 00:15:06,468
Whether you choose the sky or the sea,

188
00:15:08,549 --> 00:15:10,109
I believe you can do well.

189
00:15:15,428 --> 00:15:16,948
No matter what choice you make,

190
00:15:20,668 --> 00:15:21,765
I support you.

191
00:15:26,605 --> 00:15:32,181
<i>♫ Whose dream hasn't been beautiful ♫</i>

192
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:36,180
<i>♫ When have I ever been myself ♫</i>

193
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:42,868
<i>♫ Wait for me at the end of the daydream ♫</i>

194
00:15:43,393 --> 00:15:46,772
<i>♫ Who has wandered within it ♫</i>

195
00:15:49,009 --> 00:15:54,379
<i>♫ Life is nothing more than fantasy ♫</i>

196
00:15:54,379 --> 00:15:59,494
<i>♫ I am still me ♫</i>

197
00:16:19,404 --> 00:16:20,924
Hello, everyone.

198
00:16:20,924 --> 00:16:22,564
My name is Hu Zhongquan.

199
00:16:29,324 --> 00:16:30,924
I'm glad

200
00:16:30,924 --> 00:16:32,123
you're here to listen to my lecture.

201
00:16:40,964 --> 00:16:42,544
Marketing is a science

202
00:16:42,544 --> 00:16:44,083
and also an art.

203
00:16:50,123 --> 00:16:52,004
An art that serves customers and clients.

204
00:16:52,643 --> 00:16:55,004
It mixes logic with emotion.

205
00:16:55,803 --> 00:16:57,584
It requires us to cleverly apply

206
00:16:57,584 --> 00:16:59,464
our daily life experiences

207
00:16:59,464 --> 00:17:01,243
and insights

208
00:17:02,243 --> 00:17:04,584
and to capture, to design,

209
00:17:04,584 --> 00:17:05,984
to convey

210
00:17:05,984 --> 00:17:08,324
the most touching moments.

211
00:17:10,004 --> 00:17:12,324
Okay, that's all for my sharing.

212
00:17:13,404 --> 00:17:14,763
Finally,

213
00:17:14,763 --> 00:17:15,924
you can ask me a question.

214
00:17:15,924 --> 00:17:18,324
Any questions?

215
00:17:24,603 --> 00:17:26,603
The girl in the fourth row on the right.

216
00:17:27,243 --> 00:17:28,584
You can ask while sitting.

217
00:17:28,584 --> 00:17:29,683
Professor Hu,

218
00:17:29,683 --> 00:17:31,403
I've read your autobiography before.

219
00:17:31,403 --> 00:17:33,223
I know you dropped out

220
00:17:33,223 --> 00:17:34,324
to re-study marketing.

221
00:17:34,844 --> 00:17:37,004
I think it took a lot of courage.

222
00:17:37,004 --> 00:17:38,484
May I ask you what prompted you

223
00:17:38,484 --> 00:17:39,723
to make such a decision?

224
00:17:40,364 --> 00:17:41,444
Your question

225
00:17:41,444 --> 00:17:44,004
reminds me of my college days.

226
00:17:45,404 --> 00:17:46,797
In our time,

227
00:17:46,797 --> 00:17:49,117
the school didn't have a system
for transferring departments.

228
00:17:50,036 --> 00:17:53,437
I remember at that time,

229
00:17:53,437 --> 00:17:54,476
many people

230
00:17:54,476 --> 00:17:55,777
advised me not to be impulsive.

231
00:17:55,777 --> 00:17:57,876
They said
I was studying the most popular major.

232
00:17:58,717 --> 00:18:00,037
Why did I have to take the risk

233
00:18:00,037 --> 00:18:02,277
to do something uncertain?

234
00:18:24,277 --> 00:18:26,396
Pour your passion into your dreams

235
00:18:26,396 --> 00:18:28,036
and strive to make them come true,

236
00:18:28,637 --> 00:18:31,597
Don't make yourself regret it. Keep going.

237
00:19:21,157 --> 00:19:22,173
Shen Juan,

238
00:19:23,277 --> 00:19:25,516
I've decided. I'm applying for a transfer.

239
00:19:27,597 --> 00:19:28,701
I support you.

240
00:19:29,316 --> 00:19:30,429
You're not surprised?

241
00:19:30,996 --> 00:19:31,997
Not surprised.

242
00:19:32,757 --> 00:19:34,517
I went to Professor Hu's lecture.

243
00:19:34,517 --> 00:19:37,156
She said people should choose what they love

244
00:19:37,156 --> 00:19:39,317
and what gives them a sense of accomplishment.

245
00:19:39,317 --> 00:19:40,677
Don't let yourself regret it.

246
00:19:42,277 --> 00:19:43,857
The thing I'm proudest of

247
00:19:43,857 --> 00:19:46,257
is organizing the Daydreamer exhibition
for your uncle.

248
00:19:46,257 --> 00:19:47,937
I think though it's tiring

249
00:19:47,937 --> 00:19:49,117
to struggle together,

250
00:19:49,117 --> 00:19:50,197
it's fun.

251
00:19:51,157 --> 00:19:53,057
And when I saw the moved expressions
on the faces of those

252
00:19:53,057 --> 00:19:54,597
who came to the exhibition,

253
00:19:55,277 --> 00:19:56,637
I found what I did

254
00:19:56,637 --> 00:19:57,757
very meaningful.

255
00:20:02,117 --> 00:20:03,197
Just like you said,

256
00:20:04,436 --> 00:20:06,717
whales can dive into the sea
to find the other shore

257
00:20:07,516 --> 00:20:08,757
or leap into the sky

258
00:20:08,757 --> 00:20:09,876
to seek the light.

259
00:20:11,277 --> 00:20:12,413
I'll back you up.

260
00:20:16,476 --> 00:20:17,797
Here.

261
00:20:17,797 --> 00:20:19,157
What's this?

262
00:20:19,157 --> 00:20:20,237
Didn't you go there late?

263
00:20:20,757 --> 00:20:21,916
Professor Hu

264
00:20:21,916 --> 00:20:24,077
discussed some very popular marketing cases
in the first half.

265
00:20:24,677 --> 00:20:26,176
I thought you'd want to hear.

266
00:20:26,176 --> 00:20:27,677
You were there yesterday too?

267
00:20:29,261 --> 00:20:31,062
I didn't want you to miss important things.

268
00:20:33,821 --> 00:20:34,982
I won't let you down.

269
00:20:36,701 --> 00:20:37,861
My little whale

270
00:20:38,502 --> 00:20:40,022
has never let me down.

271
00:20:45,821 --> 00:20:47,301
Mom,

272
00:20:47,301 --> 00:20:48,422
I plan to

273
00:20:48,982 --> 00:20:50,822
transfer to the Marketing Department.

274
00:20:50,822 --> 00:20:52,442
<i>If you've thought it through,</i>

275
00:20:52,442 --> 00:20:53,802
<i>prepare well.</i>

276
00:20:53,802 --> 00:20:54,942
So

277
00:20:54,942 --> 00:20:56,022
you agree?

278
00:20:57,341 --> 00:20:58,982
<i>I told you it last time.</i>

279
00:20:58,982 --> 00:21:00,762
<i>Your life is up to you.</i>

280
00:21:00,762 --> 00:21:02,442
<i>Since you've decided,</i>

281
00:21:02,442 --> 00:21:03,602
<i>then do it.</i>

282
00:21:03,602 --> 00:21:05,062
<i>I have no objections.</i>

283
00:21:07,142 --> 00:21:08,221
Thank you, Mom.

284
00:21:13,181 --> 00:21:14,282
You are here.

285
00:21:14,282 --> 00:21:15,802
We were looking for you.

286
00:21:15,802 --> 00:21:18,062
A great piece of news for you.

287
00:21:20,821 --> 00:21:22,741
You passed the written test
for the Financial Innovation Class,

288
00:21:22,741 --> 00:21:25,142
and your ranking is quite high.

289
00:21:27,462 --> 00:21:28,502
Lin Yujing,

290
00:21:28,502 --> 00:21:29,982
why aren't you happy at all?

291
00:21:31,062 --> 00:21:32,762
I'm not going to that class.

292
00:21:32,762 --> 00:21:34,181
I've decided to transfer.

293
00:21:34,942 --> 00:21:36,022
Not going?

294
00:21:37,102 --> 00:21:38,861
That is the Financial Innovation Class.

295
00:21:39,462 --> 00:21:40,622
Are you sure you've thought it through?

296
00:21:41,701 --> 00:21:43,822
Although it's a bit of a pity to give up,

297
00:21:43,822 --> 00:21:46,102
I think we should follow our heart

298
00:21:46,102 --> 00:21:47,901
and choose a major that we really like.

299
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:53,501
Okay then.

300
00:21:53,501 --> 00:21:55,761
Anyway,
you've always taken the road less traveled.

301
00:21:55,761 --> 00:21:57,741
Whatever decision you make, I support you.

302
00:22:08,942 --> 00:22:10,942
Everyone, time to enter the examination room.

303
00:22:37,301 --> 00:22:39,081
This is our team's flag.

304
00:22:39,081 --> 00:22:40,150
Keep it well.

305
00:22:43,462 --> 00:22:44,662
These are the shooting characteristics

306
00:22:45,261 --> 00:22:46,762
and training plans of our players

307
00:22:46,762 --> 00:22:48,062
that I compiled at Coach Lei's request.

308
00:22:50,622 --> 00:22:51,670
Captain, trust me.

309
00:22:52,462 --> 00:22:53,581
I will lead our shooting team

310
00:22:53,581 --> 00:22:54,861
just like you.

311
00:23:01,701 --> 00:23:02,710
Alright.

312
00:23:04,221 --> 00:23:05,701
From this day forward,

313
00:23:05,701 --> 00:23:07,462
Shen Juan is our shooting team's captain.

314
00:23:08,462 --> 00:23:09,542
Our next target

315
00:23:09,542 --> 00:23:11,942
is the medal
for the East China University Championship.

316
00:23:12,662 --> 00:23:13,722
Does everyone have confidence?

317
00:23:13,722 --> 00:23:15,002
Yes.

318
00:23:15,002 --> 00:23:16,741
- Louder.
- Yes!

319
00:23:24,102 --> 00:23:25,162
Has the result come out?

320
00:23:25,162 --> 00:23:26,222
How is it?

321
00:23:26,222 --> 00:23:27,261
Did you pass?

322
00:23:28,341 --> 00:23:29,366
Yes, I did.

323
00:24:53,759 --> 00:24:54,800
Hey, champion!

324
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:56,496
Hello!

325
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,600
It's so cool.

326
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,200
When I was watching the game with Wang Yiyang,

327
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,560
we all lost our voices from cheering.

328
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:10,192
You're not bad either.

329
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:12,380
Your group won the first prize in

330
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:13,759
the National University Marketing Competition.

331
00:25:14,479 --> 00:25:15,536
And you won the Elite Award.

332
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:18,519
Look, there are still a few spots here.

333
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:21,120
Why not put your trophy here, too?

334
00:25:23,639 --> 00:25:25,059
I'll pass.

335
00:25:25,059 --> 00:25:27,359
I'll wait until
I have my own marketing company.

336
00:25:29,519 --> 00:25:30,799
Alright.

337
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:31,856
I'll wait.

338
00:25:34,359 --> 00:25:35,460
Now that you're the champion,

339
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:37,440
I guess you'll surely
be accepted by the provincial team.

340
00:25:38,479 --> 00:25:40,639
Yes. I came back this time to
sign the agreement with the provincial team.

341
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:42,840
I'll see if there's any nice restaurant nearby.

342
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,859
Let's have a meal

343
00:25:44,859 --> 00:25:46,080
to celebrate the start of
your professional career.

344
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:48,000
You're getting one step closer to your dream!

345
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:52,336
Well, that's quite dazzling.

346
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,760
We'll have a steamed crab,

347
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,880
a plate of shrimp,

348
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:04,139
a serving of clams,

349
00:26:04,139 --> 00:26:05,168
and two sodas.

350
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:07,480
Please wait a moment. Coming right up.

351
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:08,496
Thank you.

352
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,120
Why are you so happy today?

353
00:26:12,639 --> 00:26:13,780
Do you remember

354
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:15,080
Professor Hu Zhongquan?
The one that came to our university

355
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:16,460
to give us a lecture.

356
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:17,960
Sure. That's your idol.

357
00:26:18,479 --> 00:26:20,420
They saw the plan I made for the competition

358
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:22,279
and wanted to invite me to join their team.

359
00:26:22,279 --> 00:26:23,639
They arranged an interview for me.

360
00:26:23,639 --> 00:26:25,600
When are you going, Miss Lin?
I'll give you a ride.

361
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:26,680
Friday afternoon.

362
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:29,040
Friday?

363
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:33,000
I have to attend
the retirement ceremony on Friday.

364
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,064
Really?

365
00:26:34,639 --> 00:26:35,740
Then I'll go through the interview
as soon as possible.

366
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:36,860
I'll try to get back in time.

367
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:38,900
No need. Just focus on your interview.

368
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:40,160
You should try your best

369
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:41,160
to get this job in one go.

370
00:26:43,359 --> 00:26:44,999
Here you are. Your seafood is here.

371
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:47,152
Thank you.

372
00:26:55,799 --> 00:26:57,060
You know it, don't you?

373
00:26:57,060 --> 00:26:58,064
I don't like ginger.

374
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:02,439
I do, but the crab is cold-natured,

375
00:27:02,999 --> 00:27:04,799
so it has to be eaten with ginger.

376
00:27:05,439 --> 00:27:07,400
Says who?

377
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:09,328
Here. Eat it.

378
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:14,839
Girl, your husband is right.

379
00:27:14,839 --> 00:27:16,679
The crab has to be eaten with ginger.

380
00:27:18,439 --> 00:27:19,500
Sir, actually, we…

381
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:21,080
Sir,

382
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:23,020
we get it. Thank you.

383
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:24,679
This crab is delicious.

384
00:27:25,559 --> 00:27:26,559
Please enjoy

385
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,439
How do you know their crab is delicious
without eating it?

386
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:35,664
Now I do.

387
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:38,720
I never noticed this road is so romantic.

388
00:27:41,359 --> 00:27:42,640
Maybe because we're about to graduate.

389
00:27:43,879 --> 00:27:45,640
The scenery is the same,
but our moods are different.

390
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:48,208
Shen Juan.

391
00:27:48,879 --> 00:27:50,119
I have something for you.

392
00:27:53,239 --> 00:27:54,288
Look.

393
00:28:04,239 --> 00:28:05,999
This is the schedule I made for you.

394
00:28:07,439 --> 00:28:08,740
The dates for your trainings

395
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:09,800
and the competitions

396
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:10,940
are all written on it.

397
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:12,200
After you start your training,

398
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:13,820
we can still meet on weekends.

399
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:15,360
After you finish the competition,

400
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,499
there should be a holiday.

401
00:28:16,499 --> 00:28:18,139
We can apply for annual leave in advance.

402
00:28:18,139 --> 00:28:19,320
By then, we can travel together.

403
00:28:20,679 --> 00:28:23,119
As you wish. I'm fine with any arrangement.

404
00:28:26,239 --> 00:28:27,239
Okay, then. I'll take this for now.

405
00:28:28,479 --> 00:28:29,488
And your bag.

406
00:28:32,039 --> 00:28:33,720
Turn around. Hurry.

407
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:40,720
I'll arrange you to carry me home now.

408
00:28:41,879 --> 00:28:43,960
Alright. Sit tight.

409
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:49,616
Slow down! Slow down!

410
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:51,879
Let's go!

411
00:28:52,479 --> 00:28:53,552
Charge!

412
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,520
Congratulations.

413
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:16,039
You've officially started
your professional career.

414
00:29:19,359 --> 00:29:20,400
Coach Lei,

415
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:22,096
thank you.

416
00:29:22,679 --> 00:29:23,856
Over these years,

417
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:26,320
I've learned a lot from you.

418
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:29,700
It's your own hard work

419
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:30,999
that has brought you these achievements.

420
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:34,192
As your coach,

421
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:37,080
I have taught you every skill.

422
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:38,960
But I still want to nag a bit.

423
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:42,300
No matter what kind of competition
you'll participate in the future,

424
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:43,600
you must give it your all.

425
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:47,400
Remember, you're from
the Pucheng University Shooting Team.

426
00:29:50,119 --> 00:29:51,152
I will.

427
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:55,359
Today is your last shot at Pucheng University.

428
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,119
After this shot,

429
00:29:58,119 --> 00:29:59,120
your sports career at our school

430
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:00,200
will officially come to an end.

431
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:03,632
Are you ready?

432
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:08,752
Yes.

433
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:11,760
Come on, then.

434
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:37,616
Get ready.

435
00:31:13,159 --> 00:31:14,224
Check the firearms.

436
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,519
Turn in the bullets.

437
00:32:04,879 --> 00:32:05,920
Return the gun case.

438
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:12,624
Return to the team.

439
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:40,740
All the members of
Pucheng University Shooting Team, Grade 2017,

440
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:42,119
your retirement ceremony is completed.

441
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:48,159
I wish you a bright future.

442
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:03,399
I don't have further questions now.

443
00:33:03,399 --> 00:33:04,800
Thank you for your affirmation.

444
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:07,759
I'm looking forward to your joining.
See you in Huaicheng.

445
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:09,872
Huaicheng?

446
00:33:10,999 --> 00:33:12,740
Do I need to work in Huaicheng?

447
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:14,220
Yes, because marketing

448
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:16,379
is the core position of our entire team.

449
00:33:16,379 --> 00:33:17,960
So your work location will be in Huaicheng.

450
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:22,480
How about this? I'll send a

451
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:23,680
job offer to your email tonight.

452
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:25,100
Then you can consider it.

453
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:27,439
Can you give me a reply
by the end of the month?

454
00:33:27,439 --> 00:33:29,080
Okay, I'll reply as soon as possible.

455
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:44,560
Let's go, Rong Huai.

456
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:47,760
Aren't you going back?

457
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:59,080
I don't know what happened to me lately.

458
00:34:00,239 --> 00:34:01,379
Whenever I fell asleep,

459
00:34:01,379 --> 00:34:02,700
I would dream about us when we

460
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:03,920
lived in the dormitory of
the city team back then.

461
00:34:10,999 --> 00:34:12,060
Maybe it's because

462
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:14,080
my professional career is about to end.

463
00:34:16,399 --> 00:34:17,456
Do you still remember

464
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:20,680
the sugar-fried chestnuts
at the city team's gate were delicious?

465
00:34:21,399 --> 00:34:22,416
Sure.

466
00:34:23,239 --> 00:34:26,679
I also remember that
whenever you were homesick and crying,

467
00:34:26,679 --> 00:34:28,639
Coach Xu always comforted you
with those chestnuts.

468
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:36,159
Can't you remember some of my glorious moments?

469
00:34:38,359 --> 00:34:39,376
Certainly.

470
00:34:41,399 --> 00:34:42,720
You've been

471
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:46,159
working hard and doing your best.

472
00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:50,079
You've given a lot

473
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:51,239
for your shooting dream.

474
00:34:52,519 --> 00:34:53,584
Not only me,

475
00:34:54,759 --> 00:34:55,840
but also Coach Lei,

476
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:58,119
we all see your effort.

477
00:35:03,879 --> 00:35:04,999
I really don't want to leave.

478
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:11,440
I've long been used to
getting up early and training late every day.

479
00:35:14,479 --> 00:35:16,399
I'm also used to
standing on the shooting field with a gun.

480
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:19,600
I'm even more used to
fighting side by side with you.

481
00:35:21,239 --> 00:35:23,800
I know I haven't achieved
any remarkable results.

482
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:27,600
But my ten-year sports career

483
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:29,119
is already a part of me.

484
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:45,340
If I have the chance, I would still like to

485
00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:46,399
fight with you side by side.

486
00:35:47,639 --> 00:35:48,688
But I know

487
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:50,928
I won't have a chance again.

488
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:53,320
It's so hard to become a professional athlete.

489
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:55,620
Even Ning Yuan couldn't make it,

490
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:56,759
let alone me.

491
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:02,159
My professional career ends here.

492
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:06,896
But you, Shen Juan,

493
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,279
you must

494
00:36:10,279 --> 00:36:11,519
keep going and do your best.

495
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:16,336
In the future,

496
00:36:16,999 --> 00:36:18,720
I'm going to be a sports journalist.

497
00:36:19,639 --> 00:36:20,720
Maybe one day,

498
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,279
I can commentate on your game.

499
00:36:23,239 --> 00:36:25,220
By then, I can point to

500
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:27,159
the most shining star on the field

501
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:28,784
and tell everyone,

502
00:36:29,399 --> 00:36:30,879
"That's Shen Juan!

503
00:36:30,879 --> 00:36:31,888
He's the champion.

504
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:33,904
He's my senior

505
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:38,560
and also the best rapid-fire athlete."

506
00:36:51,391 --> 00:36:53,955
<i>[Job Offer]</i>

507
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:04,320
Why didn't you tell me when you came?

508
00:37:06,359 --> 00:37:08,080
I saw you talking to Rong Huai,

509
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:09,239
so I came out to wait for you.

510
00:37:12,879 --> 00:37:14,200
By the way,

511
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:15,280
how was your day today?

512
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:16,336
Is everything going smoothly?

513
00:37:19,239 --> 00:37:20,440
Rong Huai…

514
00:37:24,519 --> 00:37:25,648
Are you okay?

515
00:37:28,519 --> 00:37:29,584
I'm fine.

516
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:32,360
Competitive sports

517
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:33,720
are like climbing up a tall mountain.

518
00:37:34,479 --> 00:37:36,320
The higher you climb,
the fewer people there are.

519
00:37:37,639 --> 00:37:39,639
From the moment
I decided to embark on this path,

520
00:37:41,279 --> 00:37:42,400
I was already prepared

521
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:43,560
for the farewells.

522
00:37:53,613 --> 00:37:54,932
<i>When I heard them say,</i>

523
00:37:55,493 --> 00:37:57,053
<i>"Juan, wake up. We have a customer."</i>

524
00:37:58,772 --> 00:38:00,352
<i>My eyes instantly turned red.</i>

525
00:38:01,653 --> 00:38:03,252
<i>As if the past</i>

526
00:38:03,252 --> 00:38:04,332
<i>has once again returned.</i>

527
00:38:06,412 --> 00:38:08,173
<i>We carried our school bags together.</i>

528
00:38:08,173 --> 00:38:10,252
<i>We rode bicycles while chasing each other.</i>

529
00:38:11,292 --> 00:38:12,372
<i>And we laughed all the way.</i>

530
00:38:13,812 --> 00:38:15,212
<i>Time flew by,</i>

531
00:38:16,013 --> 00:38:18,493
<i>and we are about to enter
the world called society.</i>

532
00:38:20,613 --> 00:38:21,693
<i>And at this moment, we can still sit</i>

533
00:38:21,693 --> 00:38:22,812
<i>next to each other,</i>

534
00:38:23,533 --> 00:38:24,732
<i>punching each other's shoulders,</i>

535
00:38:25,533 --> 00:38:27,093
<i>while howling the tunes
that nobody could recognize.</i>

536
00:38:28,533 --> 00:38:29,852
<i>With teary eyes, we said,</i>

537
00:38:33,053 --> 00:38:34,093
<i>"It's so good to have you guys around."</i>

538
00:38:46,317 --> 00:38:50,861
<i>♫ Love sprouts in my palm ♫</i>

539
00:38:52,173 --> 00:38:56,013
<i>♫ Yet worried linger within my eyes ♫</i>

00:39:31,213 --> 00:39:36,781

547
00:39:36,781 --> 00:39:38,669

00:40:04,461 --> 00:40:08,685
<i>♫ Is a wish ♫</i>

554
00:40:09,421 --> 00:40:15,309
<i>♫ I secretly made for you ♫</i>

555
00:40:15,853 --> 00:40:21,389
<i>♫ I want to plant ♫</i>

556
00:40:21,389 --> 00:40:23,277
<i>♫ A red maple forest ♫</i>

557
00:40:23,277 --> 00:40:27,885
<i>♫ To dye the whole mountain red ♫</i>

558
00:40:28,813 --> 00:40:31,053
<i>♫ The sky after the rain ♫</i>

559
00:40:31,693 --> 00:40:36,621
<i>♫ Was painted by our brilliant dreams ♫</i>

560
00:40:43,501 --> 00:40:48,269
<i>♫ Time is a flower of dream ♫</i>

561
00:40:49,101 --> 00:40:54,187
<i>♫ You've already collected it ♫</i>

562
00:40:55,117 --> 00:40:59,117
<i>♫ When we all become better ♫</i>

563
00:41:00,589 --> 00:41:04,717
<i>♫ We'll see the best of the world together ♫</i>
