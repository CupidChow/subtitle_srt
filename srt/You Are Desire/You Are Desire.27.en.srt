00:01:35,668 --> 00:01:37,449
Mr. Hu, I assure you,

20
00:01:37,449 --> 00:01:39,229
every piece of jewelry you bought from me

21
00:01:39,229 --> 00:01:40,468
is an original creation by my master,

22
00:01:40,988 --> 00:01:42,069
not a plagiarism.

23
00:01:42,789 --> 00:01:44,468
<i>Your online store has been shut down.</i>

24
00:01:44,468 --> 00:01:45,629
<i>Isn't it because of plagiarism?</i>

25
00:01:46,468 --> 00:01:47,789
<i>Give me back my deposit quickly.</i>

26
00:01:47,789 --> 00:01:50,228
<i>Otherwise, I will come with my men
in person to collect it tomorrow. Hurry up!</i>

27
00:01:58,685 --> 00:02:00,789
Where's your rent?
You said you would pay today.

28
00:02:01,428 --> 00:02:02,525
When are you going to give it to me?

29
00:02:03,229 --> 00:02:05,429
Sir, can you give me one more week?

30
00:02:05,429 --> 00:02:06,468
Another week?

31
00:02:07,148 --> 00:02:08,389
How long have you been dragging this on?

32
00:02:11,148 --> 00:02:13,708
It's just the business has been
really bad lately.

33
00:02:16,549 --> 00:02:18,429
That's just an excuse.

34
00:02:18,429 --> 00:02:19,988
The previous tenant, Shen Juan,

35
00:02:20,629 --> 00:02:21,829
was just a student.

36
00:02:22,468 --> 00:02:23,669
He was studying while earning rent.

37
00:02:23,669 --> 00:02:24,849
He lived quite a tough life as well,

38
00:02:24,849 --> 00:02:26,629
but he never owed me a day's rent.

39
00:02:26,629 --> 00:02:28,689
I don't think you're broke.

40
00:02:28,689 --> 00:02:29,829
You're just shameless.

41
00:02:33,373 --> 00:02:34,748
Say that again!

42
00:02:36,109 --> 00:02:37,468
Why so aggressive?

43
00:02:37,468 --> 00:02:40,069
Do you think you're in the right
for not paying the rent?

44
00:02:40,069 --> 00:02:41,069
Get out!

45
00:02:41,725 --> 00:02:42,869
Out!

46
00:02:45,069 --> 00:02:47,489
Fine, don't you dare come out.

47
00:02:47,489 --> 00:02:49,069
I'll find someone to change the lock tomorrow.

48
00:03:04,275 --> 00:03:05,363
Lin Yujing.

49
00:03:06,259 --> 00:03:07,419
Senior.

50
00:03:07,419 --> 00:03:09,218
I was just thinking about calling you.

51
00:03:09,218 --> 00:03:10,291
What a coincidence!

52
00:03:10,291 --> 00:03:11,315
What's up?

53
00:03:11,315 --> 00:03:13,499
Are you interested in helping me

54
00:03:13,499 --> 00:03:14,707
translate some documents for Professor Han?

55
00:03:15,659 --> 00:03:16,883
Translate?

56
00:03:19,818 --> 00:03:21,519
Professor Han is the dean of our department.

57
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:22,859
He was the judge who praised you

58
00:03:22,859 --> 00:03:24,899
at the last marketing competition.

59
00:03:24,899 --> 00:03:26,611
He has a project that

60
00:03:26,611 --> 00:03:29,039
needs to translate
some classic foreign marketing cases.

61
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:31,419
So, he asked me to find a few students
who are good at English to do it together.

62
00:03:33,058 --> 00:03:34,059
Senior,

63
00:03:34,059 --> 00:03:36,418
I've never systematically studied
marketing theory.

64
00:03:36,418 --> 00:03:38,359
For something this specialized,

65
00:03:38,359 --> 00:03:40,559
wouldn't it be better to
ask the seniors in your department?

66
00:03:40,559 --> 00:03:42,218
Yes, but you're different.

67
00:03:42,218 --> 00:03:44,159
In the last competition, you eliminated

68
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:45,979
all the top students from our major.

69
00:03:45,979 --> 00:03:47,679
Moreover, I heard that

70
00:03:47,679 --> 00:03:50,099
you were first in the English
proficiency test for the whole school.

71
00:03:50,099 --> 00:03:52,899
There's no reason for
not asking you to join this subject.

72
00:03:54,419 --> 00:03:55,795
Okay, I'll give it a try.

73
00:03:55,795 --> 00:03:56,818
That's more like it.

74
00:03:56,818 --> 00:03:57,899
I believe you can do it.

75
00:04:05,683 --> 00:04:07,699
Okay, I got it.

76
00:04:10,538 --> 00:04:12,739
Did something happen to Shen Juan?

77
00:04:13,659 --> 00:04:15,659
The Student Union just received a notification.

78
00:04:16,179 --> 00:04:18,519
It said that Luo Qinghe, the artist from
the last exhibition you organized,

79
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:19,839
is suspected of plagiarism.

80
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:22,139
They asked us to delete the related articles.

81
00:04:22,139 --> 00:04:23,899
Is there some misunderstanding?

82
00:04:24,618 --> 00:04:27,040
Senior, could you send me that notification?

83
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,371
Sure.

84
00:04:36,096 --> 00:04:38,739
What happened?

85
00:04:38,739 --> 00:04:40,519
I heard from the Student Union that
they received a notice,

86
00:04:40,519 --> 00:04:42,019
saying your uncle plagiarized.

87
00:04:42,019 --> 00:04:43,399
I was just about to find you.

88
00:04:43,399 --> 00:04:44,699
This case is a bit tricky.

89
00:04:45,419 --> 00:04:46,499
I want to ask your brother for help.

90
00:04:47,139 --> 00:04:48,379
Let's meet at the school gate.

91
00:04:48,379 --> 00:04:49,491
I'll come to you.

92
00:04:54,995 --> 00:04:56,535
Given the current situation,

93
00:04:56,535 --> 00:04:58,155
the patent ownership
the other party applied for

94
00:04:58,155 --> 00:04:59,474
is indeed authentic and valid.

95
00:04:59,474 --> 00:05:01,235
Since the other party insists

96
00:05:01,235 --> 00:05:03,195
that he visited your uncle on April 19th

97
00:05:03,195 --> 00:05:05,135
with his design draft,

98
00:05:05,135 --> 00:05:06,915
then what we need to do is already clear.

99
00:05:07,715 --> 00:05:08,835
We just need to prove

100
00:05:08,835 --> 00:05:11,255
that the Galaxy Bird

101
00:05:11,255 --> 00:05:12,594
was designed before April 19th

102
00:05:13,274 --> 00:05:16,074
or find the receipt before that day.

103
00:05:16,955 --> 00:05:19,594
Then, we can use the fact that
Feng Li visited your uncle

104
00:05:19,594 --> 00:05:21,683
to counter them with plagiarism.

105
00:05:21,683 --> 00:05:23,403
There is another issue now,

106
00:05:24,044 --> 00:05:25,244
which is the timing.

107
00:05:27,004 --> 00:05:28,123
The first time Feng Li found me,

108
00:05:28,643 --> 00:05:30,543
he told me he wanted to
enter the domestic market.

109
00:05:30,543 --> 00:05:31,924
He emphasized to me today that

110
00:05:31,924 --> 00:05:33,004
he would only give me two days.

111
00:05:33,804 --> 00:05:35,724
I'm worried that they will soon

112
00:05:35,724 --> 00:05:37,843
launch the so-called Hanhaiji domestically.

113
00:05:39,644 --> 00:05:40,796
In that case,

114
00:05:40,796 --> 00:05:42,364
you two go back and look for evidence first.

115
00:05:42,364 --> 00:05:43,603
As soon as there's a clue,
notify me immediately.

116
00:05:46,644 --> 00:05:48,805
Find an order in all these files?

117
00:05:49,325 --> 00:05:50,813
Isn't this like finding a needle in a haystack?

118
00:05:56,445 --> 00:05:57,725
Is this it?

119
00:06:01,604 --> 00:06:03,285
But all the key information is gone.

120
00:06:03,285 --> 00:06:04,637
How are we supposed to find it?

121
00:06:06,813 --> 00:06:09,024
This order is from before April 19th.

122
00:06:09,024 --> 00:06:10,065
That is to say,

123
00:06:10,065 --> 00:06:11,885
if we can get in touch with this Zhou Hang,

124
00:06:11,885 --> 00:06:13,185
the problem can be solved.

125
00:06:13,185 --> 00:06:14,525
Zhou Hang?

126
00:06:14,525 --> 00:06:16,725
Juan, do you have
any impression of this person?

127
00:06:18,765 --> 00:06:21,185
I was preparing for
the competition at that time,

128
00:06:21,185 --> 00:06:22,653
I didn't have time to go back to
the silverware shop.

129
00:06:26,717 --> 00:06:28,125
I'll ask Nie Xinghe.

130
00:07:55,603 --> 00:07:56,707
What are you looking at?

131
00:07:57,667 --> 00:08:00,247
Didn't we fail to find any transaction records
in your uncle's email?

132
00:08:00,247 --> 00:08:02,427
So I'm just browsing around online,

133
00:08:02,427 --> 00:08:05,507
trying to find some useful clues.

134
00:08:12,723 --> 00:08:14,546
Galaxy Bird.

135
00:08:15,795 --> 00:08:16,826
What's wrong?

136
00:08:17,875 --> 00:08:19,187
Nothing.

137
00:08:19,187 --> 00:08:20,407
I was just thinking

138
00:08:20,407 --> 00:08:22,586
don't people usually bird-watch
during the day?

139
00:08:22,586 --> 00:08:24,227
And in many art works,

140
00:08:24,227 --> 00:08:26,227
birds are often combined with
blue sky and white clouds.

141
00:08:26,947 --> 00:08:28,427
Why would your uncle associate it with

142
00:08:28,427 --> 00:08:30,035
the galaxy?

143
00:08:32,467 --> 00:08:33,786
Actually, this design

144
00:08:35,146 --> 00:08:36,659
is related to me and Nie Xinghe.

145
00:08:38,626 --> 00:08:40,267
We are about the same age,

146
00:08:41,306 --> 00:08:43,586
and we had a good relationship back then.

147
00:08:44,467 --> 00:08:46,327
After I began to learn rapid firing,

148
00:08:46,327 --> 00:08:47,586
he became upset,

149
00:08:48,667 --> 00:08:50,099
always cold and cynical towards me.

150
00:08:51,443 --> 00:08:53,707
But at that time, I didn't understand why,

151
00:08:54,786 --> 00:08:57,203
so we had several big fights.

152
00:08:58,106 --> 00:08:59,347
Now I think about it,

153
00:09:00,723 --> 00:09:02,666
it was because I was too busy with training,

154
00:09:03,387 --> 00:09:04,546
I didn't have time to go back to the shop.

155
00:09:05,203 --> 00:09:06,387
Uncle was very upset,

156
00:09:08,467 --> 00:09:10,347
so he designed the Galaxy Bird,

157
00:09:11,251 --> 00:09:12,867
hoping that we could reconcile

158
00:09:13,459 --> 00:09:14,579
and get along well.

159
00:09:15,635 --> 00:09:17,907
So this bird represents you,

160
00:09:18,746 --> 00:09:21,507
and the galaxy represents Nie Xinghe.

161
00:09:24,546 --> 00:09:26,147
Is it possible

162
00:09:26,147 --> 00:09:28,547
that Zhou Hang is not his real name?

163
00:09:28,547 --> 00:09:31,126
It's probably just an image or association.

164
00:09:31,126 --> 00:09:33,139
And it's actually a pen name or a username.

165
00:09:33,139 --> 00:09:34,176
It is indeed possible.

166
00:09:34,176 --> 00:09:37,016
Uncle often visited several forums,

167
00:09:37,016 --> 00:09:38,415
and there were users placing orders.

168
00:09:39,816 --> 00:09:41,535
Maybe Zhou Hang is one of them.

169
00:09:42,136 --> 00:09:43,176
Let's look for it.

170
00:10:19,091 --> 00:10:21,519
Juan, bad news.

171
00:10:22,035 --> 00:10:23,959
I joined a marketing group earlier,

172
00:10:23,959 --> 00:10:25,715
and they put out a task for a draft.

173
00:10:25,715 --> 00:10:27,515
The client is the Lifeng Jewelry you mentioned.

174
00:10:27,515 --> 00:10:30,235
They are trying to hype up
their product's domestic launch.

175
00:10:30,235 --> 00:10:32,895
The first round is to hype up that
Qinghe Silverware copied their design.

176
00:10:33,774 --> 00:10:35,415
The release time is tomorrow afternoon at two.

177
00:10:36,819 --> 00:10:38,895
These people obviously came prepared.

178
00:10:38,895 --> 00:10:40,455
They want to monopolize your uncle's design

179
00:10:40,455 --> 00:10:41,515
and ruin his reputation.

180
00:10:42,554 --> 00:10:44,855
We have to solve this issue
before the press release.

181
00:10:44,855 --> 00:10:47,275
Otherwise, even reaching Zhou Hang
will be of no use.

182
00:10:47,955 --> 00:10:49,715
There's nothing we can do right now.

183
00:10:49,715 --> 00:10:50,867
Let's keep looking.

184
00:10:50,867 --> 00:10:51,923
Alright.

185
00:11:02,867 --> 00:11:04,259
Everyone, take a rest,

186
00:11:04,259 --> 00:11:06,067
Have a drink!

187
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:20,635
Look at this.

188
00:11:24,356 --> 00:11:25,696
Look at this shooting angle.

189
00:11:25,696 --> 00:11:27,556
It's like Zhou Hang took the photo right
outside his own house.

190
00:11:27,556 --> 00:11:29,684
Could he live right across from this address?

191
00:11:29,684 --> 00:11:31,924
His online profile says he's from Chongming.

192
00:11:32,516 --> 00:11:33,956
Chongming.

193
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:37,956
There really is a place
called No.38 Garden Street.

194
00:11:38,468 --> 00:11:40,228
We finally found his hideout.

195
00:11:40,228 --> 00:11:42,092
Time is pressing. I'll head to Chongming first.

196
00:11:42,092 --> 00:11:43,148
I'll go with you.

197
00:11:43,148 --> 00:11:44,236
Alright.

198
00:11:44,236 --> 00:11:45,412
You two can go back.

199
00:11:45,412 --> 00:11:47,020
We'll let you know immediately
if there's any news.

200
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:49,676
- If there's any issue, call us.
- Alright.

201
00:12:02,359 --> 00:12:03,447
This is the place.

202
00:12:11,927 --> 00:12:13,143
Ring the doorbell.

203
00:12:16,919 --> 00:12:19,283
The photo on the forum
was posted three years ago.

204
00:12:19,283 --> 00:12:20,522
No one's home.

205
00:12:20,522 --> 00:12:22,143
Perhaps they don't live here anymore?

206
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:24,223
Should we ask the neighbors?

207
00:12:31,351 --> 00:12:32,923
<i>I have found Zhou Hang.</i>

208
00:12:32,923 --> 00:12:34,983
<i>I've obtained the proof from him.</i>

209
00:12:34,983 --> 00:12:36,263
Come to the silverware shop.

210
00:12:39,142 --> 00:12:41,335
Nie Xinghe told me he found Zhou Hang.

211
00:12:41,335 --> 00:12:42,963
He asked me to return to the silverware shop.

212
00:12:42,963 --> 00:12:45,263
Didn't he say
he didn't know this person before?

213
00:12:45,815 --> 00:12:46,999
Anyway,

214
00:12:47,428 --> 00:12:49,022
let's go back first.

215
00:12:57,333 --> 00:13:02,359
<i>[Document Bag]</i>

216
00:13:08,599 --> 00:13:09,995
<i>After talking with you on the phone,</i>

217
00:13:09,995 --> 00:13:11,959
<i>I've organized all the emails and manuscripts</i>

218
00:13:11,959 --> 00:13:13,047
<i>your master sent me.</i>

219
00:13:13,047 --> 00:13:14,487
<i>They're all here. Have a check.</i>

220
00:13:22,039 --> 00:13:23,447
<i>Thank you so much.</i>

221
00:13:23,447 --> 00:13:24,894
<i>No need to be formal with me.</i>

222
00:13:26,894 --> 00:13:28,574
<i>Such a tragic loss of talent.</i>

223
00:14:13,047 --> 00:14:15,774
<i>Xinghe,
here are the Chongming cakes I bought for you.</i>

224
00:14:17,015 --> 00:14:18,654
<i>Thanks, Master.</i>

225
00:14:20,375 --> 00:14:21,815
<i>What are you doing?</i>

226
00:14:25,495 --> 00:14:26,871
<i>You're getting better and better at it.</i>

227
00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:29,143
<i>You're quite talented.</i>

228
00:14:31,479 --> 00:14:34,774
<i>I had planned to give it to you
after I finished carving it.</i>

229
00:14:35,319 --> 00:14:39,534
<i>Would you like to learn silverware crafting
with me in the future?</i>

230
00:14:44,567 --> 00:14:45,943
<i>Your name is Xinghe.</i>

231
00:14:46,615 --> 00:14:49,334
<i>This starry sky is perfect for you.</i>

232
00:14:51,255 --> 00:14:52,574
<i>From now on,</i>

233
00:14:53,079 --> 00:14:55,014
<i>make this place your home.</i>

234
00:15:36,087 --> 00:15:37,115
I can fix it.

235
00:15:37,115 --> 00:15:38,574
I can fix it.

236
00:15:40,774 --> 00:15:42,654
I can.

237
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:48,183
I can.

238
00:15:48,791 --> 00:15:50,654
I… It's alright.

239
00:15:57,527 --> 00:15:59,335
Nie Xinghe already found Zhou Hang,

240
00:15:59,335 --> 00:16:00,375
but he didn't tell you.

241
00:16:00,951 --> 00:16:02,974
I think there's more to this.

242
00:16:05,015 --> 00:16:06,574
I'll go in and talk to him myself.

243
00:16:07,287 --> 00:16:09,635
No matter what, we must find proof

244
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:11,134
to clear my uncle's name.

245
00:16:14,647 --> 00:16:16,214
Wait for me outside.

246
00:16:37,591 --> 00:16:38,774
Where's the evidence?

247
00:17:10,103 --> 00:17:11,295
Zhou Hang has been found.

248
00:17:11,295 --> 00:17:12,594
His real name is Xu Ning.

249
00:17:12,594 --> 00:17:13,975
And I've sent you the evidence.

250
00:17:13,975 --> 00:17:15,543
Take a look to see if it can be useful.

251
00:17:16,471 --> 00:17:18,574
The rest is up to you.

252
00:17:19,127 --> 00:17:20,295
Alright, goodbye.

253
00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:28,454
Aren't you curious

254
00:17:29,303 --> 00:17:31,894
how I found Zhou Hang before you did?

255
00:17:45,047 --> 00:17:46,615
I do have a lot of questions.

256
00:17:48,695 --> 00:17:50,974
Why didn't you tell me
when you found Zhou Hang?

257
00:17:51,607 --> 00:17:54,794
Why is there an email archive at Zhou Hang's

258
00:17:54,794 --> 00:17:56,094
but not at my uncle's?

259
00:17:56,887 --> 00:17:58,175
What did you do exactly?

260
00:18:01,335 --> 00:18:03,015
I know what you're thinking.

261
00:18:04,023 --> 00:18:05,175
That's right.

262
00:18:05,911 --> 00:18:08,454
The master's emails were deleted by me.

263
00:18:10,231 --> 00:18:13,623
But I bet you can't guess why I did it.

264
00:18:16,055 --> 00:18:17,454
On May 5,

265
00:18:18,647 --> 00:18:20,032
the master was supposed to stay home.

266
00:18:21,248 --> 00:18:22,841
<i>Hello? Are you Zhou Hang?</i>

267
00:18:22,841 --> 00:18:24,920
<i>This is Qinghe Silverware.</i>

268
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:27,801
<i>The Galaxy Bird you ordered is ready.</i>

269
00:18:27,801 --> 00:18:29,541
<i>My master asked me to confirm with you</i>

270
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:31,125
<i>the delivery address and time.</i>

271
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:36,601
<i>My address is 29th Garden Street, Chongming.</i>

272
00:18:36,601 --> 00:18:39,081
<i>As for the time, it has to be after the 8th.</i>

273
00:18:39,081 --> 00:18:41,001
<i>I'm going on a business trip tomorrow</i>

274
00:18:41,001 --> 00:18:42,241
<i>and won't be back until the 8th.</i>

275
00:18:42,241 --> 00:18:43,381
<i>No problem.</i>

276
00:18:59,375 --> 00:19:03,663
<i>[National Youth Shooting Championship]</i>

277
00:19:19,573 --> 00:19:22,220
<i>Master, I've contacted Zhou Hang.</i>

278
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:24,260
<i>He has scheduled the delivery
for the 5th of May.</i>

279
00:19:25,376 --> 00:19:27,581
<i>Good. I'll do the delivery.</i>

280
00:19:30,931 --> 00:19:32,819
I didn't want him to see your competition,

281
00:19:34,291 --> 00:19:36,059
so I lied to him,

282
00:19:37,171 --> 00:19:40,538
telling him Zhou Hang wanted him

283
00:19:41,043 --> 00:19:42,859
to deliver the Galaxy Bird
to Chongming that day.

284
00:19:43,987 --> 00:19:45,339
He went.

285
00:19:48,851 --> 00:19:50,099
Why?

286
00:19:54,259 --> 00:19:56,738
Because he always put you first.

287
00:19:59,091 --> 00:20:01,099
No matter how important his matters were,

288
00:20:01,651 --> 00:20:03,059
if you needed him,

289
00:20:03,059 --> 00:20:05,907
he would drop everything and rush to your side.

290
00:20:09,619 --> 00:20:11,378
So I had to keep him occupied

291
00:20:12,531 --> 00:20:14,339
to make him go far away,

292
00:20:14,867 --> 00:20:17,219
then he couldn't come back
and watch your competition.

293
00:20:20,659 --> 00:20:22,459
If you hadn't lied,

294
00:20:23,443 --> 00:20:25,339
he wouldn't have been in a rush to get back,

295
00:20:25,939 --> 00:20:27,498
and he wouldn't have had the accident.

296
00:20:29,843 --> 00:20:30,939
No.

297
00:20:33,011 --> 00:20:35,299
Actually, on his way there that day,

298
00:20:36,211 --> 00:20:39,018
the master had already talked to Zhou Hang
on the phone.

299
00:20:39,603 --> 00:20:41,018
He knew everything.

300
00:20:42,323 --> 00:20:43,923
He knew I lied,

301
00:20:47,155 --> 00:20:48,755
but he still went.

302
00:21:00,979 --> 00:21:03,339
All because he wanted to buy me
Chongming cakes.

303
00:21:03,923 --> 00:21:06,619
<i>That morning, he called me,</i>

304
00:21:06,619 --> 00:21:08,179
<i>saying he would deliver the goods.</i>

305
00:21:08,819 --> 00:21:11,838
<i>I said, "I told your apprentice already."</i>

306
00:21:11,838 --> 00:21:13,738
<i>"You could come again after May 8."</i>

307
00:21:14,739 --> 00:21:17,099
<i>He replied since he was here,</i>

308
00:21:17,099 --> 00:21:18,599
<i>he couldn't go back empty-handed.</i>

309
00:21:18,599 --> 00:21:20,498
<i>He also asked me
which shop had good Chongming cake.</i>

310
00:21:21,258 --> 00:21:24,399
<i>He told me
his little apprentice especially liked it.</i>

311
00:21:24,399 --> 00:21:26,138
<i>I guess he was buying it for you.</i>

312
00:21:28,371 --> 00:21:29,898
Just

313
00:21:32,019 --> 00:21:33,738
because of a ridiculous Chongming cake.

314
00:21:55,117 --> 00:21:56,477
Your uncle, who loved you the most,

315
00:21:57,558 --> 00:21:58,997
knew I lied to him,

316
00:22:00,918 --> 00:22:03,877
but he still went to buy the cake for me.

317
00:22:06,558 --> 00:22:07,597
So

318
00:22:09,597 --> 00:22:11,637
did he hurt himself?

319
00:22:19,891 --> 00:22:20,915
Shut up.

320
00:22:20,915 --> 00:22:22,117
You shut up.

321
00:22:26,877 --> 00:22:27,958
What?

322
00:22:28,517 --> 00:22:29,597
Are you disappointed?

323
00:22:30,198 --> 00:22:31,477
And heartbroken?

324
00:22:33,139 --> 00:22:35,357
The master went to Chongming for me.

325
00:22:37,237 --> 00:22:38,558
It was for me.

326
00:22:47,117 --> 00:22:48,277
Nie Xinghe,

327
00:22:49,397 --> 00:22:50,877
I know you want me to hit you

328
00:22:51,877 --> 00:22:53,357
to make you feel a little better.

329
00:22:55,438 --> 00:22:56,757
But I won't do that.

330
00:22:58,597 --> 00:22:59,798
I won't let you get what you want.

331
00:23:23,198 --> 00:23:24,237
Let's go.

332
00:24:14,931 --> 00:24:16,198
I'm fine.

333
00:24:20,531 --> 00:24:22,038
Let's go back.

334
00:24:22,038 --> 00:24:23,357
Your brother is still waiting for us.

335
00:24:24,115 --> 00:24:25,237
Let's go.

336
00:25:24,477 --> 00:25:26,038
It's all my fault.

337
00:25:26,739 --> 00:25:28,637
It's all my fault.

338
00:25:36,397 --> 00:25:38,483
I've already finished collecting evidence
from Zhou Hang.

339
00:25:38,483 --> 00:25:40,498
We now have enough evidence

340
00:25:40,498 --> 00:25:42,518
to have Feng Li withdraw the release.

341
00:25:42,518 --> 00:25:44,918
I have an appointment
with Feng Li's lawyer tomorrow.

342
00:25:45,477 --> 00:25:47,118
And you come too.

343
00:25:47,118 --> 00:25:49,577
Think about your demands.

344
00:25:49,577 --> 00:25:51,298
I will try to make them agree.

345
00:25:51,298 --> 00:25:54,451
I just want to regain my uncle's rights.

346
00:25:57,558 --> 00:25:59,859
Zhou Hang sent me all the emails he exchanged

347
00:25:59,859 --> 00:26:00,958
with your uncle,

348
00:26:00,958 --> 00:26:03,318
including the ones related to the Galaxy Bird.

349
00:26:03,318 --> 00:26:04,778
You'd better keep this

350
00:26:04,778 --> 00:26:06,678
in case anything happens in the future,

351
00:26:06,678 --> 00:26:07,918
and it can be used as evidence then.

352
00:26:10,038 --> 00:26:11,278
I'm leaving.

353
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:12,838
See you at the law firm tomorrow.

354
00:26:12,838 --> 00:26:13,838
Okay.

355
00:26:16,117 --> 00:26:17,357
Don't worry about Shen Juan's case.

356
00:26:17,958 --> 00:26:18,998
Our evidence is solid.

357
00:26:18,998 --> 00:26:20,218
We have a high chance of winning.

358
00:26:20,218 --> 00:26:21,358
I know.

359
00:26:21,358 --> 00:26:23,118
It's just that after he saw Nie Xinghe today,

360
00:26:23,118 --> 00:26:24,677
he was not looking good.

361
00:26:24,677 --> 00:26:26,498
I think something must have happened.

362
00:26:26,498 --> 00:26:27,571
He didn't want to say,

363
00:26:27,571 --> 00:26:28,838
so I didn't ask.

364
00:26:29,427 --> 00:26:30,483
Don't worry.

365
00:26:30,483 --> 00:26:31,537
He will tell you

366
00:26:31,537 --> 00:26:32,877
when he wants to.

367
00:26:34,707 --> 00:26:35,795
Lin Yujing,

368
00:26:42,078 --> 00:26:43,517
there's something I want to tell you.

369
00:26:47,357 --> 00:26:49,158
Gu Xia confessed to me,

370
00:26:50,357 --> 00:26:51,757
but I rejected her.

371
00:26:55,678 --> 00:26:56,997
She hasn't told you yet?

372
00:26:58,558 --> 00:27:00,477
Has she been okay lately?

373
00:27:01,958 --> 00:27:03,518
I've been busy with Shen Juan's case recently,

374
00:27:03,518 --> 00:27:04,958
and I haven't had time to care about her.

375
00:27:05,757 --> 00:27:07,283
You've already rejected her.

376
00:27:07,283 --> 00:27:09,198
Why do you care if she's doing well or not?

377
00:27:11,637 --> 00:27:13,838
I don't want her to be hurt because of me.

378
00:27:14,637 --> 00:27:17,043
After all, she's your friend, isn't she?

379
00:27:17,043 --> 00:27:19,318
Is it just because she is my friend?

380
00:27:19,918 --> 00:27:20,918
What about you?

381
00:27:20,918 --> 00:27:22,718
Do you have no feelings for her at all?

382
00:27:24,438 --> 00:27:26,278
From a rational perspective,

383
00:27:26,278 --> 00:27:27,898
I don't think we are suitable for each other.

384
00:27:27,898 --> 00:27:29,678
What about from an emotional perspective?

385
00:27:32,718 --> 00:27:36,198
Mingxiu, I know you're rational and cautious.

386
00:27:36,997 --> 00:27:38,778
But love isn't a lawsuit.

387
00:27:38,778 --> 00:27:40,358
You can't measure it with rationality.

388
00:27:42,198 --> 00:27:44,077
I think you need to figure out for yourself

389
00:27:44,678 --> 00:27:46,003
whether you like her or not.

390
00:27:58,517 --> 00:28:00,458
Thanks to you this time,

391
00:28:00,458 --> 00:28:02,198
this issue was successfully resolved.

392
00:28:03,718 --> 00:28:05,043
Don't mention it.

393
00:28:05,043 --> 00:28:08,358
I was just doing this favor for Lin Yujing.

394
00:28:11,237 --> 00:28:12,557
You keep this agreement.

395
00:28:13,118 --> 00:28:16,438
I've got other stuff to do. I have to go.

396
00:28:16,997 --> 00:28:19,598
Okay, I'll treat you to a meal next time.

397
00:28:28,211 --> 00:28:31,667
<i>[Agreement]</i>

398
00:28:35,918 --> 00:28:38,638
<i>[All is well. A complete victory.]</i>

399
00:28:47,477 --> 00:28:48,557
Senior,

400
00:28:52,878 --> 00:28:55,878
Senior, Lifeng Jewelry has agreed to apologize.

401
00:28:56,398 --> 00:28:57,958
Once the apology letter arrives,

402
00:28:58,878 --> 00:29:01,837
can our public account be restored?

403
00:29:03,557 --> 00:29:06,118
Okay, I'll coordinate it.

404
00:29:07,443 --> 00:29:08,467
Didn't you ask me here

405
00:29:08,467 --> 00:29:10,837
to see your translated materials?

406
00:29:12,797 --> 00:29:13,978
I have translated it.

407
00:29:13,978 --> 00:29:15,158
You take a look.

408
00:29:20,557 --> 00:29:21,858
Your translation is very good.

409
00:29:21,858 --> 00:29:24,358
For a first translation,
this is already very good.

410
00:29:25,158 --> 00:29:27,558
Combining the Doctrine of the Mean
into marketing theory.

411
00:29:27,558 --> 00:29:29,517
I've never seen anything like this before.

412
00:29:30,118 --> 00:29:32,037
This was proposed by Professor Hu Zhongquan.

413
00:29:32,037 --> 00:29:34,158
She is a master in the marketing field.

414
00:29:34,718 --> 00:29:36,357
Sounds pretty interesting,

415
00:29:36,357 --> 00:29:37,958
I'll look into it more when I get back.

416
00:29:38,757 --> 00:29:40,557
I've never seen you so interested.

417
00:29:41,237 --> 00:29:44,298
By the way,
there is a student salon on Wednesday.

418
00:29:44,298 --> 00:29:46,517
It's organized by our department head,
Professor Han.

419
00:29:47,077 --> 00:29:49,958
It's mainly about the analysis
of some marketing cases.

420
00:29:49,958 --> 00:29:51,198
Would you like to come and listen?

421
00:29:53,299 --> 00:29:54,451
Okay.

422
00:30:14,829 --> 00:30:17,965
<i>[Go for it, Juan.]</i>

423
00:31:51,997 --> 00:31:53,918
This is the agreement I signed with Feng Li.

424
00:31:55,037 --> 00:31:56,518
He will issue a public apology

425
00:31:56,518 --> 00:31:57,918
to my uncle

426
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:03,638
and withdraw the application
for a patent of the silverware design.

427
00:32:04,557 --> 00:32:06,198
The money earned from the Galaxy Bird

428
00:32:06,198 --> 00:32:09,158
will all be donated to
the Original Silverware Foundation.

429
00:32:09,918 --> 00:32:11,638
You don't have to tell me that.

430
00:32:14,037 --> 00:32:15,317
I think you should know.

431
00:32:19,317 --> 00:32:20,918
It has nothing to do with me anymore.

432
00:32:22,037 --> 00:32:24,358
I have decided to close this shop

433
00:32:24,947 --> 00:32:26,163
and leave here.

434
00:32:31,918 --> 00:32:33,139
Look at this first.

435
00:32:33,139 --> 00:32:35,438
These are the words my uncle failed to tell you

436
00:32:35,438 --> 00:32:37,678
in person.

437
00:32:49,678 --> 00:32:51,758
<i>Zhou Hang, I want to know something</i>

438
00:32:51,758 --> 00:32:52,938
<i>about the procedures</i>

439
00:32:52,938 --> 00:32:54,638
<i>for adding a partner to the studio.</i>

440
00:32:54,638 --> 00:32:55,958
<i>I'll go to ask someone.</i>

441
00:32:55,958 --> 00:32:57,558
<i>Why did you suddenly ask this?</i>

442
00:32:57,558 --> 00:32:59,518
<i>I've been considering it for a long time.</i>

443
00:32:59,518 --> 00:33:01,838
<i>I plan to add my apprentice's name
to the partners</i>

444
00:33:01,838 --> 00:33:03,757
<i>when he turns 18.</i>

445
00:33:04,398 --> 00:33:06,098
<i>I only took in such an apprentice.</i>

446
00:33:06,098 --> 00:33:09,018
<i>He's been having a hard time.</i>

447
00:33:09,018 --> 00:33:11,038
<i>I hope to give him some sense of belonging.</i>

448
00:33:11,038 --> 00:33:12,278
<i>Parents love their children</i>

449
00:33:12,278 --> 00:33:13,638
<i>and plan for them in the long run.</i>

450
00:33:14,237 --> 00:33:16,819
<i>You're almost a parent to him.</i>

451
00:33:16,819 --> 00:33:19,018
<i>That kid really likes making silverware,</i>

452
00:33:19,018 --> 00:33:20,138
<i>and he has talent.</i>

453
00:33:20,138 --> 00:33:21,318
<i>When he grows up,</i>

454
00:33:21,318 --> 00:33:24,598
<i>I'll hand over my shop to him if he wants.</i>

455
00:33:25,237 --> 00:33:26,398
You always think

456
00:33:27,635 --> 00:33:29,139
that my uncle favored me more

457
00:33:30,517 --> 00:33:32,158
and wanted to leave the shop to me.

458
00:33:34,158 --> 00:33:35,398
But in the end,

459
00:33:36,997 --> 00:33:39,187
the one he wanted to entrust the shop to

460
00:33:39,891 --> 00:33:41,075
was you.

461
00:33:42,398 --> 00:33:44,158
Due to your own inferiority

462
00:33:44,757 --> 00:33:45,837
and stubbornness,

463
00:33:46,477 --> 00:33:47,598
you misunderstood him.

464
00:33:49,198 --> 00:33:50,358
He never cared less for you

465
00:33:52,198 --> 00:33:53,517
than he did for me.

466
00:33:58,557 --> 00:33:59,878
If that's true,

467
00:34:00,918 --> 00:34:03,037
why has Master never told me?

468
00:34:06,118 --> 00:34:07,338
He hoped we would do

469
00:34:07,338 --> 00:34:09,158
what we liked to do.

470
00:34:10,438 --> 00:34:11,718
I liked shooting,

471
00:34:12,557 --> 00:34:13,997
so he supported me in it.

472
00:34:15,118 --> 00:34:16,478
He also hoped that you could find

473
00:34:16,478 --> 00:34:18,277
what you liked to do.

474
00:34:19,958 --> 00:34:21,878
Even though you liked making silverware,

475
00:34:22,878 --> 00:34:25,417
he didn't want you

476
00:34:25,417 --> 00:34:26,878
tied to the shop.

477
00:34:39,797 --> 00:34:41,477
I'll respect his wish.

478
00:34:42,398 --> 00:34:43,918
His design drafts

479
00:34:44,755 --> 00:34:46,178
and his shop.

480
00:34:46,178 --> 00:34:47,598
I'll give them all to you.

481
00:34:48,997 --> 00:34:51,837
The rest is up to you.

482
00:34:56,277 --> 00:34:57,797
Giving the shop to me.

483
00:35:00,557 --> 00:35:01,797
Don't you mind it?

484
00:35:08,118 --> 00:35:10,277
I've never thought about fighting
with you for anything.

485
00:35:11,878 --> 00:35:13,398
I'm doing this

486
00:35:14,237 --> 00:35:15,958
not because I have forgiven you.

487
00:35:17,757 --> 00:35:19,797
I just want to fulfill my uncle's wish.

488
00:35:21,843 --> 00:35:23,477
Don't disappoint him anymore.

489
00:35:51,517 --> 00:35:54,931
<i>[Luo Qinghe]</i>

490
00:36:46,899 --> 00:36:48,399
<i>For a long time,</i>

491
00:36:48,399 --> 00:36:49,625
<i>I couldn't accept</i>

492
00:36:49,625 --> 00:36:52,339
<i>the death of my most important person.</i>

493
00:36:53,939 --> 00:36:56,100
<i>I locked myself in a room,</i>

494
00:36:56,953 --> 00:36:59,939
<i>as if I was imprisoning myself.</i>

495
00:37:00,985 --> 00:37:04,100
<i>Someone pulled me out of it</i>

496
00:37:04,921 --> 00:37:06,859
<i>and woke me from the nightmare.</i>

497
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:09,979
<i>I should really move on now</i>

498
00:37:10,899 --> 00:37:14,100
