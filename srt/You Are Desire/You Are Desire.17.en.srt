seems to be something I've never seen before.

00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:54,079
give me a hand!

00:02:15,199 --> 00:02:16,759
come help. I can't hold it any longer.

32
00:02:16,759 --> 00:02:18,159
The box is stuck.

00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:19,319
I'm coming.

34
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,759
I can't do it anymore.

<i>You wild child.</i>

00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,599
<i>Wild child.</i>

44
00:03:33,719 --> 00:03:34,759
<i>What are you doing?</i>

45
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,720
Young lady,

46
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:36,920
the stuff is all here.

47
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,160
Thank you very much.

48
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,240
- Thank you for your hard work.
- Thank you.

49
00:05:03,648 --> 00:05:04,759
I want to make a display case

50
00:05:04,759 --> 00:05:05,759
to put here.

51
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:06,839
And then display

52
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:08,279
some of my uncle's works

53
00:05:08,279 --> 00:05:09,280
that have never been exhibited before.

54
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,656
That's a good idea.

55
00:05:10,656 --> 00:05:12,192
Let's make it all glass.

56
00:05:12,192 --> 00:05:13,279
It will perfectly highlight

57
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:14,480
the beauty of his works.

58
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,879
But before that,

59
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,680
I have something else to do.

60
00:05:24,896 --> 00:05:28,224
<i>[Qinghe Silverware]</i>

61
00:05:38,439 --> 00:05:39,648
Actually, the first time I saw you

62
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,279
was not in the silverware shop.

63
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,519
Back then, I just arrived in this city

64
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,920
and was listening to my dad's nagging
in his car.

65
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,319
I was so annoyed.

66
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:51,160
Then I saw you riding past
with this signboard on your back,

67
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,959
and you even scratched my dad's car.

68
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:57,079
So I visited your shop the next day.

69
00:05:58,848 --> 00:05:59,936
Look,

70
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:04,040
I already had an impression of you
before you knew me.

71
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,399
- Hello.
- Sir, hello.

72
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,600
Are you renting or buying a house?

73
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,720
Renting.

74
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,839
The empty shop

75
00:06:35,839 --> 00:06:37,440
on the street up front.

76
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,496
I want to rent it.

77
00:06:38,496 --> 00:06:39,616
Are you talking about that one?

78
00:06:39,616 --> 00:06:40,720
That one is not for rent.

79
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,160
The tenant came over today.

80
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,920
He said he was going to reopen the shop.

81
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,240
You're back so soon.

82
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:06,279
Hello, we meet again.

83
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:11,120
We haven't opened yet. You should leave.

84
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,240
Didn't Shen Juan tell you?

85
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:20,639
Right, he's got no right

86
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:23,968
to tell you who I am.

87
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,439
I am the apprentice

88
00:07:26,439 --> 00:07:27,439
of Luo Qinghe,

89
00:07:27,439 --> 00:07:28,960
the real owner of this shop.

90
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,279
I used to live here.

91
00:07:32,199 --> 00:07:33,199
Do you want to chat?

92
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:35,959
Like

93
00:07:35,959 --> 00:07:38,656
Shen Juan's past that you don't know.

94
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:42,279
If I want to know, I'll ask myself.

95
00:07:42,839 --> 00:07:43,872
I don't need you to bother.

96
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:47,160
But I bet

97
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,736
he wouldn't dare tell you.

98
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:50,912
Why don't you ask him

99
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,759
how my master,

100
00:07:52,759 --> 00:07:54,480
who was also his uncle,

101
00:07:55,079 --> 00:07:56,439
got into a car accident?

102
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:58,519
See if he will tell you.

103
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:00,639
Please leave.

104
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:02,120
It was Shen Juan's fault

105
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,480
that Luo Qinghe had an accident.

106
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:16,040
You dare to come here. Shut up.

107
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:17,720
Did I say something wrong?

108
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:20,600
Isn't it true that you caused
your uncle's death?

109
00:08:21,639 --> 00:08:22,759
And you still don't want to admit it?

110
00:08:22,759 --> 00:08:24,896
Shen Juan.

111
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,480
Get out.

112
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:45,000
Even if you beat me to death,

113
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,832
the fact that you caused your uncle's death

114
00:08:48,832 --> 00:08:50,480
won't change.

115
00:08:51,679 --> 00:08:52,736
Shen Juan,

116
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:54,919
you owe him for the rest of your life.

117
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:56,559
You can never fully repay it.

118
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,240
When I was eight,

119
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:29,360
my parents went to Africa for aid construction.

120
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,080
My mom didn't want me to suffer with them,

121
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,240
so she sent me to my uncle's side.

122
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,919
My uncle had just returned from Guangzhou.

123
00:09:48,576 --> 00:09:50,480
<i>[Qinghe Silverware]</i>
And then he opened this silverware shop.

124
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,399
<i>Qinghe,</i>

125
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:56,576
<i>from now on, the kid is in your hands.</i>

126
00:09:56,576 --> 00:09:57,696
<i>Call him uncle.</i>

127
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,648
<i>It's okay.</i>

128
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,280
Afterward,

129
00:10:14,159 --> 00:10:16,399
I lived with him the whole time.

130
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:18,360
He was an artist.

131
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,600
He used what he was best at

132
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,664
to take care of me.

133
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,448
That is,

134
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,559
he had me learn silverware making with him

135
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,159
to inherit his craft.

136
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:36,080
My uncle was someone

137
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,200
who lived in his own world,

138
00:10:39,399 --> 00:10:40,960
focusing on what he loved.

139
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,640
Maybe others found it hard

140
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:45,679
to understand him.

141
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,288
But he was a very kind man

142
00:10:48,879 --> 00:10:50,519
at heart.

143
00:10:52,448 --> 00:10:54,639
He adopted the homeless Nie Xinghe.

144
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:58,559
Nie Xinghe lost his mom when he was young.

145
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,440
His dad owed money and ran away,

146
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,200
leaving him and his grandma
to rely on each other.

147
00:11:05,159 --> 00:11:06,720
People often came to his house
to collect debts,

148
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:08,720
making it impossible for him to return home.

149
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,559
He could only hide
in my uncle's silverware shop.

150
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:15,759
It was my uncle's tolerance and patience

151
00:11:16,559 --> 00:11:17,919
that slowly changed him,

152
00:11:19,159 --> 00:11:21,480
giving him a normal life.

153
00:11:23,039 --> 00:11:24,200
But in the end,

154
00:11:25,879 --> 00:11:27,559
my uncle probably never expected

155
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:32,519
to be harmed by the two kids he raised himself.

156
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:36,840
It all started

157
00:11:38,519 --> 00:11:39,600
with the tryout

158
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,320
for a youth shooting team.

159
00:11:43,028 --> 00:11:45,464
<i>[Youth Shooting Range]</i>

160
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:08,224
<i>[Shen Juan 29, Zhang Li 26, Hu Hao 22]
The one selected for the city's youth team is</i>

161
00:12:08,224 --> 00:12:09,248
<i>Shen Juan.</i>

162
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:14,120
- Hurry up.
- Wait for me.

163
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:20,992
Go.

164
00:12:26,559 --> 00:12:27,584
Wait for me.

165
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:30,304
So

166
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:32,639
my uncle sent me to the shooting team.

167
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,528
At that time,

168
00:12:34,528 --> 00:12:36,360
I didn't notice his feeling of loss.

169
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:44,559
The training life of the shooting team

170
00:12:44,559 --> 00:12:45,559
was an experience

171
00:12:45,559 --> 00:12:47,159
I'd never had before.

172
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:50,592
I liked it

173
00:12:50,592 --> 00:12:51,759
and enjoyed it very much.

174
00:12:53,799 --> 00:12:54,879
At that time,

175
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,559
my uncle often texted me,

176
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,424
asking how my training was going.

177
00:12:59,424 --> 00:13:00,736
<i>Uncle, you've worked hard.</i>

178
00:13:00,736 --> 00:13:03,320
He would also share some
of his new works with me.

179
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,544
<i>Thanks, Juan.</i>

180
00:13:04,544 --> 00:13:07,720
But I was so focused on training,

181
00:13:08,879 --> 00:13:12,180
So my contact with him gradually decreased.

182
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:14,080
After I joined the shooting team,

183
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:16,120
only Nie Xinghe was left

184
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:17,360
to accompany my uncle.

185
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,360
<i>You did really well.</i>

186
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:28,240
Actually, I had long noticed
Nie Xinghe's dissatisfaction with me,

187
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:31,960
but I didn't care about it at that time.

188
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,592
Gradually,

189
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,360
I forgot the original agreement with my uncle

190
00:13:38,559 --> 00:13:40,120
to inherit his craft

191
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,240
and make Qinghe Silverware

192
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,799
a century-old shop.

193
00:13:47,799 --> 00:13:49,120
When I was in ninth grade,

194
00:13:50,519 --> 00:13:51,960
I finally advanced to the provincial team

195
00:13:52,879 --> 00:13:55,000
and got the qualification
to participate in the national championship.

196
00:13:56,679 --> 00:13:57,984
The first thing I did

197
00:13:57,984 --> 00:14:00,512
was to tell my uncle the good news.

198
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,104
<i>Uncle,</i>

199
00:14:03,104 --> 00:14:04,320
<i>I've been selected

<i>the National Youth Shooting Championship.</i>

201
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:08,399

202

<i>[Message From Uncle]</i>

204
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,080
On the day of the competition,

205
00:14:24,519 --> 00:14:25,960
the seat I reserved for my uncle

206
00:14:26,919 --> 00:14:28,120
remained vacant throughout.

207
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,840
I thought my uncle was busy,

208
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:33,600
so I gave him a call.

209
00:14:34,279 --> 00:14:37,519
But it seemed he had forgotten about it.

210
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,879
<i>If I'd known,
I wouldn't have reserved the ticket.</i>

211
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,120
<i>Among the seating area
for the relatives and friends,</i>

212
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,639
<i>only your seat is unoccupied.</i>

213
00:14:48,039 --> 00:14:51,296
He could hear my anger over the phone,

214
00:14:52,039 --> 00:14:54,879
so he promised to rush over immediately.

215
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:59,360
<i>Juan, I'm sorry. I'll be there soon.</i>

216
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,720
<i>I promise I'll be there for the finals.</i>

217
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:07,480
<i>This round will determine the champion
of the match.</i>

218
00:15:25,559 --> 00:15:26,639
That day, it was raining heavily.

219
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,840
But because he was in a rush to get here,

220
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:31,080
my uncle was driving too fast.

221
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:34,799
And three kilometers from the venue,

222
00:15:35,799 --> 00:15:36,840
an accident still happened.

00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,360
<i>Congratulations to Shen Juan for becoming</i>

00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
<i>The text messages are gone.</i>

229
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:14,720
<i>The ticket wasn't on my uncle either.</i>

230
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:16,960
<i>He didn't forget</i>

<i>So what?</i>

238
00:18:15,359 --> 00:18:17,680
<i>You damned. It's all because of you.</i>

239
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:23,136

00:18:23,136 --> 00:18:25,440

<i>It's all your fault.</i>

250

Because of the fight,

251
00:19:29,079 --> 00:19:30,519
I was disciplined by the school

252
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,480
and suspended for a year.

253
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:38,640
After that,

254
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,079
I never saw Nie Xinghe again.

255
00:19:48,759 --> 00:19:50,160
Actually, he was right.

256
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:52,599
It rained so heavily that day.

257
00:19:56,119 --> 00:19:58,559
If I hadn't insisted on my uncle coming
to watch my competition,

258
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,759
he wouldn't have had the accident.

259
00:20:06,519 --> 00:20:07,799
He wouldn't have…

260
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:21,760
I'm okay.

261
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:26,039
Actually, it's quite good now.

262
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:30,799
Just like the decision

263
00:20:31,559 --> 00:20:32,880
my uncle made at the beginning

264
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:35,640
to have me inherit the silverware shop.

265
00:20:49,519 --> 00:20:50,528
It's okay.

266
00:20:53,279 --> 00:20:54,599
Nothing can defeat me.

- Hello.
- Thanks.

- The introduction to the competition…
- Over there.

280
00:22:25,312 --> 00:22:27,640
- No, I'm asking for a friend.
- We have it here too.

281
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:32,119
- This one, right?
- We'll have very authoritative judges.

282
00:22:32,119 --> 00:22:33,119
Okay, I'll make a note of it.

283
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:36,800
- We're late. Hurry up.
- Go.

<i>Alright.</i>

289
00:22:51,759 --> 00:22:53,519
For the reopening

290
00:22:53,519 --> 00:22:55,008
of the silverware shop,

291
00:22:55,008 --> 00:22:56,640
I thought of a decent marketing plan.

292
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:59,640
We could hold an exhibition
of your uncle's works.

293
00:23:01,359 --> 00:23:03,424
Sounds like a decent idea.

294
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:05,248
But holding an exhibition requires funds,

295
00:23:05,248 --> 00:23:09,152
equipment and a venue which won't be cheap.

296
00:23:09,152 --> 00:23:10,160
Say it.

297
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:11,279
Have you already thought it all through?

298
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:15,839
The Marketing Competition?

299
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,464
The winners of this competition

300
00:23:18,464 --> 00:23:20,440
can monetize their design exhibitions.

301
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,464
In other words, if we win,

302
00:23:22,464 --> 00:23:24,224
we can use the school's exhibition hall

303
00:23:24,224 --> 00:23:25,440
to hold an exhibition of your uncle's works.

304
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,480
And the Student Union will cover the costs.

305
00:23:28,039 --> 00:23:30,304
But most of the competition teams
in the Student Union

306
00:23:30,304 --> 00:23:33,504
are composed of experienced seniors
with professional knowledge.

307
00:23:33,504 --> 00:23:35,456
If we, as amateurs, participate in this,

308
00:23:35,456 --> 00:23:36,960
we may just be also-rans

309
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:40,256
and might not even pass the preliminary round.

310
00:23:40,256 --> 00:23:43,440
What's so difficult about that?
Is it harder than the college entrance exam?

311
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,952
We've made it through the fierce competition
of the college entrance exam.

312
00:23:45,952 --> 00:23:47,240
Are we afraid of this?

313
00:23:58,816 --> 00:23:59,968
Let's assign tasks.

314
00:23:59,968 --> 00:24:01,312
Alright.

315
00:24:01,312 --> 00:24:03,480
This time, I must perform well.

316
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:08,832
- You'll be shooting the works. It's tough.
- Okay.

317
00:24:08,832 --> 00:24:12,512
- He, can you handle logistics and outreach?
- No problem.

318
00:24:12,512 --> 00:24:14,592
I'll be in charge of assistance
and filling in gaps.

319
00:24:14,592 --> 00:24:18,119
Well, the most important part
of this project is your uncle's works.

320
00:24:18,119 --> 00:24:20,576
You know the value of his works

321
00:24:20,576 --> 00:24:21,920
and his story better than we do.

322
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:24,960
So you're more qualified than anyone
to be the project planner.

323
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,319
The materials are almost prepared.

324
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:40,512
It's definitely enough
for the preliminary round.

325
00:24:40,512 --> 00:24:43,104
But it's necessary for us to be more prepared

326
00:24:43,104 --> 00:24:45,039
because the final round is quite close
to the preliminary round.

327
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:48,680
Don't worry about the materials.

328

to our hometown this weekend?

There are many of my uncle's early works there.

330

We can also learn more from my other uncle.

There was a very famous haunted house nearby.

363
00:28:18,359 --> 00:28:19,488
Haunted house?

364
00:28:20,279 --> 00:28:21,279
That's what it was called,

365
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:23,400
but actually, it was just a scavenger old lady
who lived there.

366
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:26,000
The kids around there mistook her for a ghost.

367
00:28:27,319 --> 00:28:29,376
We went to explore the haunted house at night

368
00:28:29,376 --> 00:28:30,680
and scared the old lady.

369
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:33,599
When my uncle knew it,
he took us to apologize to her.

370
00:28:34,359 --> 00:28:36,480
But Nie Xinghe was terrified

371
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:39,200
and had nightmares every night.

372
00:28:40,039 --> 00:28:41,480
So my uncle made this silver ornament.

373
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:44,480
He told us

374
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:46,480
the old woman was even more beautiful

375
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:49,480
than the girl on this when she was young.

376
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:52,680
Just as expected from him.

377
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:54,640
It feels like

378
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,000
he was a magician.

379
00:28:57,039 --> 00:28:58,960
What he made was not silverware,

380
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:00,720
but magical tools.

381
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:03,240
Even nightmares
could be turned into sweet dreams.

382
00:29:09,759 --> 00:29:12,279
<i>Today is the deadline for the competition.
Don't be late, everyone.</i>

383
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:15,799
<i>How could it be possible?
I just got on the bus.</i>

384
00:29:16,319 --> 00:29:17,799
<i>I'm already downstairs at Juan's house.</i>

385
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:23,559
Good.

386
00:30:23,559 --> 00:30:25,000
Come and take a look at this.

387
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,136
I think…

388
00:30:27,136 --> 00:30:29,559
I think
the third and the fifth pictures are better.

389
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:32,480
This one is good.

390
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:33,880
I think so too.

391
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:35,000
Now we just need a name.

392
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,279
I've thought about the name.

393
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,080
You've thought about it already?

394
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,400
Daydreamer.

395
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:57,240
<i>The works of this artist are whimsical,</i>

396
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:59,480
<i>yet it gives a sense</i>

397
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:01,359
<i>of endless and mysterious power.</i>

398
00:31:02,759 --> 00:31:03,960
<i>His works</i>

399
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:05,400
<i>never chase trends</i>

400
00:31:06,319 --> 00:31:07,839
<i>because what he seeks is</i>

401
00:31:08,359 --> 00:31:09,400
<i>the balance</i>

402
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:10,592
<i>between two opposing things.</i>

403
00:31:11,839 --> 00:31:13,279
<i>So our participation this time</i>

404
00:31:13,839 --> 00:31:15,160
<i>is dedicated to commemorating</i>

405
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:17,359
<i>this artist who used his own life</i>

406
00:31:18,119 --> 00:31:20,160
<i>to light up others' dreams.</i>

407
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,079
<i>Luo Qinghe.</i>

408
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:34,400
- Here you are.
- Here you are.

409
00:31:47,759 --> 00:31:49,200
<i>Hello, am I speaking with Lin Yujing?</i>

410
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:51,279
Yes, it's me.

411
00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:53,079
<i>This is the Student Union
of the School of Economics and Management.</i>

412
00:31:54,759 --> 00:31:56,240
Wait a second. Please go ahead.

413
00:31:58,799 --> 00:31:59,872
<i>Congratulations.</i>

414
00:31:59,872 --> 00:32:03,200
<i>Your team has made it to the final
of the Marketing Competition.</i>

415
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:05,824
<i>Submit the detailed plan to the Student Union
before next Thursday.</i>

416
00:32:05,824 --> 00:32:07,640
<i>Wait to compete with the other three teams.</i>

417
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:11,279
- Okay. We will definitely prepare well.
<i>- Alright.</i>

418
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:12,480
We really won!

419
00:32:19,839 --> 00:32:22,624
I told you. Gold will always shine.

420
00:32:22,624 --> 00:32:25,440
We were bound to win. Who else if not us?

421
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:28,288
Especially since the two smartest brains
are here,

422
00:32:28,288 --> 00:32:29,559
how could we lose?

423
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:33,759
To sincerely thank everyone,

424
00:32:34,759 --> 00:32:35,839
I'm treating you all tonight.

425
00:32:37,599 --> 00:32:39,279
You put it back.

426
00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:41,039
- No problem.
- Hurry up.

427
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:53,039
The final competition

428
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:54,640
will be in the form of speeches.

429
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:57,696
Your content is very sincere and warm.

430
00:32:57,696 --> 00:32:58,720
I like it a lot.

431
00:32:59,359 --> 00:33:01,248
However, those who can make it to the final

432
00:33:01,248 --> 00:33:03,839
are all elite teams from the school.

433
00:33:03,839 --> 00:33:05,319
You must not underestimate them

434
00:33:06,039 --> 00:33:07,680
and prepare well with your partner.

435
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,799
Yes, I will.

436
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:30,912
Lin Yujing.

437
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:37,480
What's wrong?

438
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:38,799
About Shen Juan's returning to the team…

439
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:43,936
This matter can't be rushed.

440
00:33:43,936 --> 00:33:45,248
Let's first focus on the exhibition.

441
00:33:45,248 --> 00:33:46,308
If it is successful,

442
00:33:46,308 --> 00:33:48,288
it can be considered as realizing
his uncle's dream

443
00:33:48,288 --> 00:33:50,200
and maybe he will be able
to let go of the burden.

444
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:53,440
Then we'll try to figure out
how to get him back on the field.

445
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:02,816
Shen Juan.

446
00:34:02,816 --> 00:34:03,840
Shen Juan.

447
00:34:21,039 --> 00:34:22,440
Can you not get angry first?

448
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:26,360
I'm not angry.

449
00:34:27,639 --> 00:34:29,440
I've made it clear to Rong Huai.

450
00:34:31,239 --> 00:34:32,559
What's past is past.

451
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:35,000
I don't like rapid-fire shooting either.

452
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:40,000
And I don't need you to decide for me.

453
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:46,320
I'm not deciding for you.

454
00:34:50,039 --> 00:34:51,552
From childhood to adulthood,

455
00:34:51,552 --> 00:34:52,920
everything has been arranged for me by others.

456
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:56,559
The only decision I made myself

457
00:34:56,559 --> 00:34:57,559
was to attend Pucheng University

458
00:34:58,320 --> 00:34:59,480
and return to your side.

459
00:35:04,039 --> 00:35:06,599
I just can't believe
that you don't love shooting anymore.

460
00:35:09,719 --> 00:35:10,880
That day at your house,

461
00:35:12,239 --> 00:35:14,239
I accidentally went into your room.

462
00:35:15,199 --> 00:35:19,920
I saw that the walls were full of your awards,
trophies, model guns

463
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:21,760
and your picture when you won.

464
00:35:22,519 --> 00:35:25,079
You looked so happy in that.

465
00:35:25,079 --> 00:35:26,599
There were stars in your eyes.

466
00:35:27,159 --> 00:35:28,800
So I just can't believe

467
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:30,944
you would give up something

468
00:35:30,944 --> 00:35:32,519
you've loved for so long that easily.

469
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:35,039
You want to help your uncle realize his dream.

470
00:35:35,039 --> 00:35:37,856
Can't you also give your dream a chance?

471
00:35:37,856 --> 00:35:39,199
Don't leave any regrets.

472
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:43,599
<i>If you hadn't insisted on learning shooting,</i>

473
00:35:44,119 --> 00:35:47,648
<i>if you hadn't insisted on him going
to watch your damn competition…</i>

474
00:35:47,648 --> 00:35:49,079
<i>It's all your fault.</i>

475
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:51,480
There are no regrets.

476
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,199
Because of me, my uncle…

477
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:09,079
In the face of death,

478
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:12,320
other things are not important in comparison.

479
00:36:13,519 --> 00:36:14,679
How are they not important?

480
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:18,079
Do you want to stay in the same place
for the rest of your life because of guilt?

481
00:36:19,199 --> 00:36:22,440
Shen Juan, have you ever thought about it?

482
00:36:23,519 --> 00:36:25,360
Would your uncle want to see you like this?

483
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:22,360
<i>What are you carving?</i>

484
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:25,280
<i>A crop circle.</i>

485
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:27,400
<i>Sci-fi novels say crop circles are symbols</i>

486
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:29,632
<i>that can open wormholes</i>

487
00:37:29,632 --> 00:37:32,320
<i>which can help people travel through time.</i>

488
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:36,704
<i>I want to go to the future to see</i>

489
00:37:36,704 --> 00:37:38,599
<i>what kind of adult I'll become.</i>

490
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:41,000
<i>So what do you think</i>

491
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:44,719
<i>your future self would look like?</i>

492
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:47,079
<i>I…</i>

493
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:50,400
<i>haven't decided yet.</i>

494
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:55,264
<i>Juan, do you want to inherit</i>

495
00:37:55,264 --> 00:37:56,760
<i>my silver jewelry shop?</i>

496
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:05,960
<i>Juan, you're really talented.</i>

497
00:38:08,639 --> 00:38:09,696
<i>Keep it up.</i>

498
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:40,928
Lin Yujing,

499
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:42,760
aren't you and Shen Juan going

500
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:44,256
to his uncle's house tomorrow?

501
00:38:44,256 --> 00:38:45,376
Have you packed your things?

502
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:47,488
It's over there.

503
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:52,280
You're going to his uncle's house
with just this bag?

504
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:56,832
Tomorrow will be the first time you've met
his family since you got together.

505
00:38:56,832 --> 00:38:58,239
You'd better dress up.

506
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:03,584
Let me think.

507
00:39:03,584 --> 00:39:04,599
Dress well.

508
00:39:09,216 --> 00:39:12,480
<i>[We're going to the old house tomorrow.
See you at the station at eight.]</i>

509
00:39:22,144 --> 00:39:26,800
<i>[Entrance, Ticket Office]</i>

510
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:28,760
<i>The train is almost leaving.</i>

511
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:31,239
<i>He's not still angry and not coming, right?</i>

512
00:39:34,519 --> 00:39:35,744
Lin Yujing,

513
00:39:38,159 --> 00:39:40,000
the ticket machine was broken, so I'm late.

514
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:43,079
Let's hurry and get on the train.

515
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:05,216
Just the two of you?

516
00:40:05,216 --> 00:40:07,039
Where are Wang Yiyang and He Songnan?

517
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:09,119
They both have things to do and couldn't come.

518
00:40:11,199 --> 00:40:13,719
They couldn't come.

519
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:18,760
Lin, I'm glad you came.

520
00:40:20,039 --> 00:40:21,920
I'm very happy, too.

521
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,079
Let's go to my home.

522
00:40:24,719 --> 00:40:25,920
Let's go to our home.

523
00:40:31,519 --> 00:40:33,152
This is our village.

524
00:40:33,152 --> 00:40:36,400
Shen Juan's mom and Qinghe grew up here.

525
00:40:37,719 --> 00:40:40,800
You both must be tired from the journey.
Take a rest when we get back.

526
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,400
Shen Juan, take Lin

527
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:43,712
for a good walk around tomorrow.

528
00:40:43,712 --> 00:40:44,736
Okay.

529
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:47,039
This place is so beautiful.

530
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:53,199
When Qinghe was young,
he would draw on this beach.

531
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:56,679
Sometimes he would draw for an entire day,
not even coming home to eat.

532
00:41:02,496 --> 00:41:05,696
<i>[Aguo Seafood]</i>

533
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,008
Lin,

534
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:13,472
if the pillow is too low for you,

535
00:41:13,472 --> 00:41:15,552
you can get another one

536
00:41:15,552 --> 00:41:17,152
from the top of the wardrobe.

537
00:41:17,152 --> 00:41:18,272
Okay.

538
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:24,559
Got it, sir.

539
00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:26,760
- Go to sleep now.
- Good night.

540
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:28,000
<i>You said with a smile,</i>

541
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,079
<i>"I'm doing fine."</i>

542
00:42:30,239 --> 00:42:31,360
<i>But what I saw was a soul</i>

543
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:33,239
<i>licking its wounds alone.</i>

544
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:35,639
<i>Stubbornly holding onto a memory,</i>

545
00:42:36,599 --> 00:42:38,159
<i>carrying someone's future on its back,</i>

546
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:42,159
<i>yet forgetting to find itself.</i>

547
00:42:53,402 --> 00:42:57,946
<i>♫ Love sprouts in my palm ♫</i>

548
00:42:59,258 --> 00:43:03,098
<i>♫ Yet worried linger within my eyes ♫</i>

549
00:43:04,890 --> 00:43:09,466
<i>♫ Our story hasn't ended ♫</i>

550
00:43:10,394 --> 00:43:14,074
<i>♫ So where are we now ♫</i>

551
00:43:15,898 --> 00:43:21,562
<i>♫ I want to hug you so badly ♫</i>

552
00:43:21,562 --> 00:43:25,626
<i>♫ I want to become better with you ♫</i>

553
00:43:26,874 --> 00:43:31,738
<i>♫ The youth we shared ♫</i>

554
00:43:31,738 --> 00:43:37,786
<i>♫ Turned into a rainbow within my heart ♫</i>

555
00:43:38,298 --> 00:43:43,866
<i>♫ I really want to warm you ♫</i>

556
00:43:43,866 --> 00:43:45,754
<i>♫ I want to share with you ♫</i>

557
00:43:45,754 --> 00:43:50,426
<i>♫ The beauty of the world ♫</i>

558
00:43:51,310 --> 00:43:53,530
<i>♫ We promised ♫</i>

559
00:43:54,106 --> 00:43:59,802
<i>♫ To never be apart ♫</i>

560
00:44:00,538 --> 00:44:06,240
<i>♫ Do you want to hear me sing ♫</i>

561
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:11,002
<i>♫ The wind chime swaying in my heart ♫</i>

562
00:44:11,546 --> 00:44:15,770
<i>♫ Is a wish ♫</i>

563
00:44:16,506 --> 00:44:22,394
<i>♫ I secretly made for you ♫</i>

564
00:44:22,938 --> 00:44:28,474
<i>♫ I want to plant ♫</i>

565
00:44:28,474 --> 00:44:30,362
<i>♫ A red maple forest ♫</i>

566
00:44:30,362 --> 00:44:34,970
<i>♫ To dye the whole mountain red ♫</i>

567
00:44:35,898 --> 00:44:38,138
<i>♫ The sky after the rain ♫</i>

568
00:44:38,778 --> 00:44:43,706
<i>♫ Was painted by our brilliant dreams ♫</i>

569
00:44:50,586 --> 00:44:55,354
<i>♫ Time is a flower of dream ♫</i>

570
00:44:56,186 --> 00:45:01,272
<i>♫ You've already collected it ♫</i>

571
00:45:02,202 --> 00:45:06,202
<i>♫ When we all become better ♫</i>

572
00:45:07,674 --> 00:45:11,802
<i>♫ We'll see the best of the world together ♫</i>
