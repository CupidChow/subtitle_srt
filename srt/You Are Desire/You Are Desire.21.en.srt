Awake now?

20
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,079
Don't take advantage of my being sick
to bully me.

21
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,328
That's better.

22
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,536
Your fever's gone.

23
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,400
Take your medicine later.

24
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,496
Then get some more sleep.

25
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,439
You didn't get much rest yesterday, did you?

26
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,479
Aren't you going to take the day off today?

27
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,719
The National University Games is coming up.

28
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,960
I can't miss team practice

29
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,056
or assignments.

30
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,000
I'll go to the shooting team later.

31
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,960
You just rest well at home.

32
00:03:07,879 --> 00:03:08,879
Don't make me worry anymore.

33
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,208
I'm leaving now.

35
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,639
That's today's training. You get it?

36
00:04:13,639 --> 00:04:14,848
Yes.

37
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,800
Sorry, coach, I'm late.

38
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,199
Why are you late?

39
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:28,680
Sorry.

40
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:29,680
There won't be a next time.

41
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,424
The competition is about to start.

42
00:04:32,319 --> 00:04:34,120
This is the final stage,
the most important time.

43
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,120
We must give it our all.

44
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:38,304
No one can slack off. Understand it?

45
00:04:38,304 --> 00:04:39,616
Yes.

46
00:04:42,279 --> 00:04:43,552
I don't care what your reason is.

47
00:04:43,552 --> 00:04:44,720
If you're late again,

48
00:04:45,319 --> 00:04:46,439
you will be disqualified.

49
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:50,816
Yes.

50
00:04:50,816 --> 00:04:52,079
Go out and run ten laps before coming back in.

51
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:57,888
Go to train.

52
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,120
What are you here for?

53
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,800
The environment of this university is good.

54
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,160
You're really lucky.

55
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,959
Have you forgotten

56
00:05:57,959 --> 00:05:59,959
how my master had his accident?

57
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,920
How can you have the face

58
00:06:03,839 --> 00:06:05,312
to return to the shooting field

59
00:06:05,312 --> 00:06:06,959
and chase your so-called dream?

60
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:14,176
Is this what you came here

61
00:06:14,176 --> 00:06:15,279
to tell me?

62
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,720
I'm afraid if I don't remind you,

63
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,480
you will completely forget.

64
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:24,680
This is my business,

65
00:06:25,639 --> 00:06:26,959
and it's none of your concern.

66
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,079
Professor,

67
00:06:58,079 --> 00:07:00,279
is there a problem with my term paper?

68
00:07:00,839 --> 00:07:03,639
Your topic selection
and viewpoints this time are quite good.

69
00:07:04,256 --> 00:07:06,399
The legal study of cyberspace.

70
00:07:07,079 --> 00:07:08,120
I've read it

71
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:10,519
and think you should delve deeper
into this topic.

72
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,279
Try to produce an academic paper

73
00:07:13,279 --> 00:07:14,519
to represent our law school
in the Freshman Cup paper competition.

74
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:20,319
Actually,
you don't need to write too many viewpoints.

75
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:24,416
You can start with a few practical, hot topics.

76
00:07:24,416 --> 00:07:26,959
I see from your paper

77
00:07:26,959 --> 00:07:28,224
that you have done a deep study on this topic.

78
00:07:28,224 --> 00:07:31,424
It shouldn't be a problem for you
to represent our school in the competition.

79
00:07:31,424 --> 00:07:33,439
Submit it when the next semester starts.

80
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:35,936
Okay.

81
00:07:35,936 --> 00:07:37,279
I will do my best.

85
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:17,120

What's so great about you?

89
00:08:23,872 --> 00:08:25,720
I'll just do it myself.

90
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:15,399
Forget it. If I don't understand, just ask.

91
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,879
Especially when seeking advice
from professionals.

92
00:09:17,879 --> 00:09:19,159
There's nothing shameful about it.

What's the matter?

97
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:10,320
You've been to Huaicheng
to see me so many times?

98
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:25,679
After you transferred schools,

99
00:12:26,919 --> 00:12:27,960
I talked to Liu.

100
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:31,279
He told me
you were studying at Huaicheng High School.

101
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:34,759
I wanted to see you,

102
00:12:34,759 --> 00:12:35,968
so I went to find you.

103
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,919
Why didn't you tell me?

104
00:12:42,559 --> 00:12:44,639
Weren't you afraid that I wouldn't come back?

105
00:12:50,799 --> 00:12:51,808
You wouldn't.

106
00:12:53,159 --> 00:12:54,320
I knew you would come back.

107
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,320
I wanted to wait for you
to come back on your own.

108
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,312
Can you tell me now

109
00:13:09,312 --> 00:13:10,919
what exactly happened last night?

110
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,240
Actually, it's nothing much.

111
00:13:16,919 --> 00:13:18,720
Just like what they show on TV dramas.

112
00:13:19,679 --> 00:13:21,480
A mother who's frustrated with her daughter

113
00:13:22,519 --> 00:13:24,120
wants her daughter to listen to her

114
00:13:24,759 --> 00:13:27,120
and be what she wants her to be.

115
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,919
However, the child has her own thoughts

116
00:13:31,879 --> 00:13:33,559
and wants to live her own life.

117
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:36,159
So when they meet, they argue.

118
00:13:38,679 --> 00:13:40,320
That's the kind
of relationship I have with my mom.

119
00:13:41,879 --> 00:13:42,912
I've been wanting to change

120
00:13:42,912 --> 00:13:45,679
our hurtful way of communication.

121
00:13:47,639 --> 00:13:49,120
I thought once I went to college

122
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,679
and turned 18,

123
00:13:50,679 --> 00:13:52,559
all the terrible things would get better.

124
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,136
I went back to Pucheng for college,

125
00:13:55,136 --> 00:13:56,919
and I could live the life I wanted.

126
00:13:57,919 --> 00:14:00,000
All I wanted was her approval
and understanding.

127
00:14:01,879 --> 00:14:03,039
But this meeting

128
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,399
made me realize my thoughts were too naive.

129
00:14:07,879 --> 00:14:09,200
My mom will never change.

130
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,000
She's still the same.

131
00:14:11,639 --> 00:14:14,200
If it's not the path she chose, it's wrong.

132
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,519
I must listen to her.

133
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:20,120
She doesn't consider what's best for me.

134
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,000
She just wants me to be an obedient puppet.

135
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,320
Now, I'm with you.

136
00:14:44,879 --> 00:14:46,519
No matter what happens in the future,

137
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,679
I'll face it with you.

138
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:15,600
Actually, you didn't need to rush back here.

139
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,120
I've been training intensively recently

140
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,272
and staying in the dorm.

141
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,360
Didn't I move here because of you?

142
00:15:21,039 --> 00:15:22,720
It's more convenient for you,
and you don't have to go back and forth.

143
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,080
Alright, I'll listen to you.

144
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:29,080
Then I'll go back.

145
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,440
Rest early after you finish training.

146
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,679
- Go ahead.
- Bye.

147
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,720
Mr. Fu,

148
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,039
Mr. Fu,

149
00:16:02,039 --> 00:16:03,279
didn't you see me?

150
00:16:06,879 --> 00:16:08,416
What's the matter?

151
00:16:08,416 --> 00:16:09,600
I…

152
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,039
Just like I mentioned earlier,

153
00:16:11,039 --> 00:16:13,240
I would like you to guide me on my thesis.

154
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:16,240
You are the most knowledgeable,

155
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:19,552
experienced and helpful person I know.

156
00:16:19,552 --> 00:16:22,144
I believe you would be willing to teach

157
00:16:22,144 --> 00:16:23,399
and help me solve my problems.

158
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,679
If I remember correctly,

159
00:16:27,679 --> 00:16:30,519
I just declined your request
for thesis guidance.

160
00:16:30,519 --> 00:16:31,872
Why are you still here?

161
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:36,480
I thought
seeing face to face might make you reconsider.

162
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:39,240
Maybe if you're in a good mood today,
you might agree.

163
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:41,888
You've been working hard.
I've prepared sparkling water for you.

164
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,840
Got it. I'll be right there.

165
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:02,016
Please wait a moment.

166
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:05,039
I've got stuff to do. I'm leaving.

167
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:06,272
You should go back.

168
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:08,359
Wait for me there.

169
00:17:08,359 --> 00:17:09,720
Remember to drink water.

170
00:17:19,279 --> 00:17:20,440
Let's gather around.

171
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,079
I have something to tell everyone.

172
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:24,039
The National University Games
is about to start.

173
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:27,440
So we've decided to let everyone go
to Jiangcheng for closed training.

174
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:29,559
Since the National University Games
is also held in Jiangcheng,

175
00:17:29,559 --> 00:17:30,816
we can familiarize ourselves
with the environment.

176
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:34,599
The number of people in the other groups
just meets the team competition requirements,

177
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:36,279
so they all can participate.

178
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,920
But in our men's 25m rapid-fire group,
we have six members.

179
00:17:40,519 --> 00:17:41,568
Only three spots.

180
00:17:42,319 --> 00:17:43,744
Three.

181
00:17:43,744 --> 00:17:46,160
It means three of you will not be able to go.

182
00:17:46,759 --> 00:17:48,880
So Coach Yu and I have discussed this.

183
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,519
We will have an internal selection match
the day after tomorrow.

184
00:17:50,519 --> 00:17:53,119
The top three can just participate.

185
00:17:53,119 --> 00:17:54,839
The team participating in the training
with us this time is

186
00:17:54,839 --> 00:17:56,279
the Jiangcheng University Shooting Team.

187
00:17:57,039 --> 00:18:00,279
The results will tell who qualifies.

188
00:18:00,279 --> 00:18:01,408
Go to train.

189
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:13,799
Jiangcheng University Shooting Team.

190
00:18:13,799 --> 00:18:16,256
That's an ace team
that has won several championships.

191
00:18:16,256 --> 00:18:17,799
National University Games 25m rapid-fire,

192
00:18:17,799 --> 00:18:19,440
defending champion in the team competition,

193
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,480
three-time national champion,

194
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:21,640
youth group champion

195
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:23,480
and the champion of various school leagues.

196
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:24,960
That's quite a reputation.

197
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,464
Are you from Pucheng University
or Jiangcheng University?

198
00:18:26,464 --> 00:18:27,640
You seem to like Jiangcheng University a lot.

199
00:18:28,519 --> 00:18:31,119
If you have time to build up others' morale
and damage your own,

200
00:18:31,119 --> 00:18:32,880
you might as well spend some time
honing your own skills.

201
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:37,759
Why did you stop talking?

202
00:18:38,519 --> 00:18:40,079
You're not helping me
with noise training anymore?

203
00:18:41,359 --> 00:18:42,400
Noise training.

204
00:18:43,119 --> 00:18:45,632
Right, you know my good intentions.

205
00:18:45,632 --> 00:18:46,816
Captain, don't worry.

206
00:18:46,816 --> 00:18:48,319
I'll train hard during the intensive training,

207
00:18:48,319 --> 00:18:49,568
and I won't hold our team back.

208
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,279
Besides,

209
00:18:51,279 --> 00:18:52,559
we've still got you

210
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:54,176
and the captain in our team, right?

211
00:18:54,176 --> 00:18:55,200
We'll make it.

212
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:16,000
<i>[Don't forget to take your medicine.]</i>

213
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:20,160
<i>[I know. I've taken it already.]</i>

214
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,064
Mr. Cui.

215
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:51,264
I just happened to be
on a business trip to Pucheng

216
00:19:51,264 --> 00:19:52,319
and dropped by to see you.

217
00:19:53,599 --> 00:19:54,839
My mom asked you to come, didn't she?

218
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:00,960
You suddenly left Huaicheng,
and Ms. Lin was very worried about you.

219
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,160
So she specifically asked me
to come and see you.

220
00:20:04,839 --> 00:20:06,920
You're on holiday,
and there's hardly anyone at school.

221
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:07,968
Why don't you

222
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:09,920
come back with me?

223
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:12,480
No need to bother you, Mr. Cui.

224
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,720
I've got things to do at school,
so I won't go back for now.

225
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:15,776
Goodbye, Mr. Cui.

226
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:18,976
And, Mr. Cui,

227
00:20:18,976 --> 00:20:20,279
please tell my mom for me

228
00:20:20,839 --> 00:20:23,319
I am an adult now
and that I can take care of myself.

229
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:25,728
I'm leaving.

230
00:20:30,907 --> 00:20:31,960
<i>[Specialist Clinic]</i>

231
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:33,200
The examination report is out.

232
00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:35,039
Your hemangioma

233
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:36,672
is still growing.

234
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:40,200
If it continues at this rate,
it would rupture at any time.

235
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:44,288
I've told you to have it surgically removed
as soon as possible.

236
00:20:44,288 --> 00:20:46,519
The longer you delay, the greater the risk.

237
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,888
You need to make a decision
as soon as possible.

238
00:21:10,464 --> 00:21:13,440
<i>Ms. Lin, Yu has already arrived at school.</i>

239
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,599
<i>But she doesn't want to return
to Huaicheng for the time being.</i>

240
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:18,839
It's fine, as long as she's at school.

241
00:21:19,359 --> 00:21:20,519
No need to bring her back.

242
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,384
Looking forward to your next visit.

243
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:37,504
Take care.

244
00:21:42,319 --> 00:21:43,360
Mr. Fu.

245
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:51,744
Why are you here again?

246
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:53,984
I've been here all along. I didn't leave.

247
00:21:53,984 --> 00:21:55,039
Isn't that sincere enough?

248
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:58,880
Persistent

249
00:22:00,039 --> 00:22:01,440
and commendable.

250
00:22:02,079 --> 00:22:03,319
Why did you drink so much?

251
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:05,720
I didn't drink much.

252
00:22:08,599 --> 00:22:10,279
Don't drink when you need to drive.

253
00:22:10,279 --> 00:22:11,720
Don't drive if you're drunk.

254
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:16,000
I would never knowingly break the law.

255
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,519
What you're saying? Be careful.

256
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:23,456
Mr. Fu, where do you live?

257
00:22:23,456 --> 00:22:24,960
I'll call a taxi to take you home.

258
00:22:42,759 --> 00:22:43,936
Mr. Fu,

259
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:46,016
Mr. Fu,

260
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:47,104
Mr. Fu,

261
00:22:48,119 --> 00:22:49,184
Mr. Fu.

262
00:22:51,799 --> 00:22:53,079
Let's play hopscotch together.

263
00:22:57,359 --> 00:22:59,712
- Can you do it?
- I can't.

264
00:22:59,712 --> 00:23:01,480
- Can you?
- No.

265
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:02,519
You can't, but I can.

266
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:06,200
I can.

267
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:12,480
Alright.

268
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:21,319
One square with one foot.

269
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,559
Two squares with both feet.

270
00:23:23,559 --> 00:23:24,608
Be careful.

271
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,304
Be careful.

272
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,048
Again.

273
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,352
- Do you know who I am?
- Who are you?

274
00:23:52,352 --> 00:23:55,519
I am the legal king of Pucheng.

275
00:23:55,519 --> 00:23:56,576
The legal king.

276
00:23:56,576 --> 00:23:58,599
I'll do it again.

277
00:23:58,599 --> 00:23:59,759
The legal king.

278
00:23:59,759 --> 00:24:02,640
- Can you help me with my thesis?
- Later.

279
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:03,759
Can you help me?

280
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,160
One square.

281
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,799
Two squares.

282
00:24:07,799 --> 00:24:09,056
One square.

283
00:25:03,559 --> 00:25:04,640
Secretary Cui,

284
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:06,480
please look into something for me.

285
00:25:33,119 --> 00:25:34,720
<i>Can you help me with my thesis?</i>

286
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,224
<i>The legal king.</i>

287
00:25:36,224 --> 00:25:37,376
<i>Later.</i>

288
00:25:38,079 --> 00:25:39,136
<i>I'll do it again.</i>

289
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:45,960
<i>One square with one foot. Two…</i>

290
00:25:48,079 --> 00:25:49,079
<i>Who are you?</i>

291
00:25:49,079 --> 00:25:52,119
<i>I am the legal king of Pucheng.</i>

292
00:26:06,319 --> 00:26:09,319
- Mr. Fu.
- Filming videos without the consent

293
00:26:09,319 --> 00:26:10,640
of the parties involved is an infringement.

294
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:11,880
I advise you to delete it immediately.

295
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:14,176
Otherwise,
I will reserve the right to take legal action.

296
00:26:14,176 --> 00:26:15,200
I can delete it.

297
00:26:15,759 --> 00:26:18,144
<i>But the premise is
that you help me with my thesis.</i>

298
00:26:18,144 --> 00:26:19,359
This is a threat.

299
00:26:19,359 --> 00:26:20,759
Am I the kind of person
who would be intimidated into submission?

300
00:26:20,759 --> 00:26:23,039
Coincidentally, I am not either.

301
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:26,640
Oh, right. I just thought of something.

302
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,992
<i>When I interned at the law firm before,</i>

303
00:26:28,992 --> 00:26:30,519
<i>I didn't quit the work group.</i>

304
00:26:30,519 --> 00:26:31,920
If you don't agree

305
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:33,599
to help me soon,

306
00:26:33,599 --> 00:26:35,759
<i>I might accidentally post the video</i>

307
00:26:36,359 --> 00:26:37,480
to the group.

308
00:26:42,319 --> 00:26:43,759
Alright, then…

309
00:26:43,759 --> 00:26:46,079
you can text me your thesis topic first.

310
00:26:46,079 --> 00:26:47,640
Okay, right away.

311
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:01,720
<i>[Stage training results]</i>
The results are out.

312
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,119
Let's go take a look.

313
00:27:05,519 --> 00:27:07,104
I rank second.

314
00:27:07,104 --> 00:27:08,128
What do you think?

315
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:21,920
We waited for so long,

316
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:24,000
but the rapid-fire group's results
are still unchanged.

317
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,720
In my opinion,
the preliminary competition held by Coach Lei

318
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:27,960
is totally unnecessary.

319
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:30,079
It would save more time
to just go by the grades.

320
00:27:30,079 --> 00:27:31,880
Can daily training and competition be the same?

321
00:27:32,519 --> 00:27:34,976
Although in terms of scores,
Shen Juan is two points behind Chang,

322
00:27:34,976 --> 00:27:36,880
their gap is constantly narrowing.

323
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:39,079
And in terms of total rings,
Shen Juan has already surpassed him.

324
00:27:39,799 --> 00:27:41,359
High total rings don't matter.

325
00:27:41,359 --> 00:27:43,552
The rapid-fire event is not the same
as the slow-fire one.

326
00:27:43,552 --> 00:27:44,832
It's about the hit rate.

327
00:27:44,832 --> 00:27:46,880
And in the internal competition,

328
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,279
Shen Juan never won once.

329
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:50,400
Exactly.

330
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,359
If Shen Juan was given another 15 days,

331
00:27:52,359 --> 00:27:53,359
he would be selected

332
00:27:53,359 --> 00:27:54,720
for sure.

333
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,400
But the selection competition is tomorrow.

334
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:58,039
Sorry, he doesn't have a chance.

335
00:27:59,319 --> 00:28:02,039
Things on the field can change in an instant.
Who can say for sure?

336
00:28:02,039 --> 00:28:04,160
I believe Shen Juan can get into the top three.

337
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,216
Let's make a bet

338
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:08,000
just on who can make it
to the selection competition.

339
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,599
The loser will be on duty for the winner.

340
00:28:09,599 --> 00:28:12,000
Okay. You're on.

341
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,200
Stop talking. He's here.

342
00:28:14,079 --> 00:28:15,136
Chang.

343
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:48,599
Don't stand here and watch. Go practice.

344
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:53,440
Who do you think will win tomorrow,
me or Shen Juan?

345
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,592
We'll know once we compete.

346
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,039
I'm a senior now.

347
00:28:58,039 --> 00:29:00,319
This will be my last time
to play for Pucheng University.

348
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:02,880
So I don't want to lose,

349
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:03,920
and I can't lose.

350
00:29:05,319 --> 00:29:07,400
I must secure this opportunity

351
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:08,920
to attend this training camp.

352
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:11,720
So train hard
and take the competition seriously.

353
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:12,880
What's with the drama here?

354
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:16,680
If you want to win,

355
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:19,119
what you should think about isn't
how not to lose to others

356
00:29:20,039 --> 00:29:21,880
but how to overcome yourself.

357
00:29:23,519 --> 00:29:24,880
That's how the strong ones think.

358
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,440
Shen Juan, please help me.

359
00:30:06,079 --> 00:30:07,456
Right here.

360
00:30:12,039 --> 00:30:13,440
It's okay.

361
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:14,680
- Thanks.
- Not at all.

362
00:30:15,839 --> 00:30:18,039
Shen Juan, did you hear me making a bet?

363
00:30:18,039 --> 00:30:19,480
I bet you will be in the top three tomorrow.

364
00:30:20,519 --> 00:30:23,456
Selection is based on performance, not bets.

365
00:30:23,456 --> 00:30:24,799
But betting is important, too.

366
00:30:24,799 --> 00:30:26,240
It represents what the people support.

367
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,799
Anyway, I've already said it.

368
00:30:27,799 --> 00:30:29,920
I'm sure you can outperform Chang tomorrow.

369
00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:31,680
I have faith in you.

370
00:30:33,319 --> 00:30:37,359
Our shooting team was also good in the past.

371
00:30:37,359 --> 00:30:38,920
But in recent years, talents have dwindled,

372
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,400
so we've been surpassed.

373
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:42,200
However, Coach Lei never gave up.

374
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:43,599
He recruited the captain two years ago

375
00:30:43,599 --> 00:30:45,319
and added you to the team this year.

376
00:30:45,319 --> 00:30:46,960
He wants to start with the rapid-fire group

377
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,480
to invigorate the whole shooting team.

378
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:49,504
I understand.

379
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:51,680
Coach Lei has placed

380
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:52,680
the hope of our shooting team's success

381
00:30:53,319 --> 00:30:55,359
on the 25m rapid-fire project.

382
00:30:56,119 --> 00:30:57,440
So Shen Juan,

383
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:58,480
you now have

384
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:00,319
a heavy responsibility.

385
00:31:00,319 --> 00:31:01,359
If we can't get some results

386
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:02,920
in the National University Games,

387
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:04,599
the budget for the entire shooting team
for the second half of the year

388
00:31:04,599 --> 00:31:06,079
will be cut.

389
00:31:06,079 --> 00:31:08,079
But there's one thing I've never understood.

390
00:31:08,079 --> 00:31:09,279
Why should we train together

391
00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:11,319
with Jiangcheng University's team?

392
00:31:11,319 --> 00:31:12,992
The gap in strength is so big.

393
00:31:12,992 --> 00:31:14,920
Isn't this like handing our confidence to them

394
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:16,000
to be trampled on?

395
00:31:17,119 --> 00:31:19,359
Has Coach Lei given up completely?

396
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,240
He hasn't given up.

397
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:25,039
He hopes

398
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:27,000
that we can face the gap
between us and the strong teams

399
00:31:27,839 --> 00:31:29,160
and not shy away when facing them.

400
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:30,240
Only then will we have a chance to win.

401
00:31:31,599 --> 00:31:32,799
You're right.

402
00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:34,160
We have a long way to go

403
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:35,200
to revive our shooting team.

404
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,288
It's up to you now.

405
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:44,640
Today's test

406
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,319
will follow the rules of the final.

407
00:31:46,319 --> 00:31:49,160
After three rounds of four-second shooting,
the last place will be eliminated.

408
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:51,640
The top three will become the selected players
for the official game

409
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:53,240
and directly join the training camp.

410
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:55,039
Get ready. The game begins now. Come on.

411
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:13,440
The first round of shooting starts.

412
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:23,904
Ready.

413
00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:45,600
The first round ends.

414
00:32:46,122 --> 00:32:47,552
<i>[Ning Yuan, Cheng Lei, Chang Zhiqi,
Zeng Xin, Shen Juan, Tang Qi]</i>

415
00:32:52,839 --> 00:32:53,839
The second round starts.

416
00:32:59,319 --> 00:33:00,480
Ready.

417
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:22,720
The third round starts.

418
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:34,119
Elimination starts from this round.

419
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:36,640
The fourth round starts.

420
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,039
Go, Shen Juan!

421
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:53,024
Ready.

422
00:34:17,079 --> 00:34:18,880
Great, he's caught up.

423
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:21,344
But he's still at the bottom.

424
00:34:21,344 --> 00:34:22,599
There are two more rounds of elimination.

425
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:26,039
The fourth round ends. Player A is eliminated.

426
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,224
The fifth round begins.

427
00:34:32,039 --> 00:34:33,056
Ready.

428
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:42,880
You've overtaken him!

429
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:44,159
Good job, Shen Juan.

430
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:45,360
He is really lucky.

431
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:47,079
What's there to say?

432
00:34:47,079 --> 00:34:49,024
Luck is also a part of strength.

433
00:34:49,024 --> 00:34:51,000
Fine, I hope he keeps the strength

434
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,239
in the next round.

435
00:34:53,559 --> 00:34:54,880
Player D is eliminated.

436
00:34:55,559 --> 00:34:56,840
The final round begins.

437
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:01,856
Ready.

438
00:35:24,039 --> 00:35:25,120
Ready.

439
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:44,760
Great, Shen Juan.

440
00:35:51,639 --> 00:35:53,360
Player E is eliminated.

441
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:54,360
The game is over.

442
00:36:03,679 --> 00:36:05,119
The game results are out.

443
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:07,159
According to the results,

444
00:36:07,159 --> 00:36:08,320
the top three players are

445
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,400
Ning Yuan, Cheng Lei

446
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:10,559
and Shen Juan.

447
00:36:10,559 --> 00:36:12,559
Go to prepare.
We'll set off for Jiangcheng tomorrow

448
00:36:12,559 --> 00:36:14,119
to attend the closed training camp.

449
00:36:14,119 --> 00:36:15,559
Coach,

450
00:36:15,559 --> 00:36:19,000
I want to have another match with Shen Juan.

451
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,880
He always ranked fourth or fifth before,
never entering the top three.

452
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:23,040
He has never won against me.

453
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:26,639
So this victory of his
can only be attributed to luck.

454
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:28,519
I can't accept it.

455
00:36:30,519 --> 00:36:31,559
I don't think it's necessary.

456
00:36:32,119 --> 00:36:34,400
You lost the match
because you had a problem with your attitude.

457
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,800
He was behind, but he finally caught up.

458
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:39,280
It proves that he's mentally superior to you.

459
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:41,159
A match is a match.

460
00:36:41,159 --> 00:36:42,440
There's no such thing as a do-over.

461
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:43,679
Only with strong mental quality

462
00:36:43,679 --> 00:36:45,039
can one go all the way.

463
00:36:45,039 --> 00:36:46,048
Do you understand?

464
00:36:49,519 --> 00:36:50,528
Dismissed.

465
00:36:58,519 --> 00:36:59,800
<i>[Is it over? How did it go?]</i>

466
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,679
<i>[Juan, answer me.]</i>

467
00:37:02,679 --> 00:37:04,320
<i>[Did it go smoothly?
How many kills did you get?]</i>

468
00:37:05,679 --> 00:37:06,920
<i>[I'm going for closed training tomorrow.]</i>

469
00:37:16,719 --> 00:37:19,280
How is it? When are you leaving for Jiangcheng?

470
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:20,352
I'm waiting for the notice.

471
00:37:21,199 --> 00:37:23,320
Why aren't you surprised at all
that I made it to the selection match?

472
00:37:25,159 --> 00:37:26,880
Why should I be surprised?

473
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:28,280
My sixth sense told me

474
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:29,440
you would definitely do it.

475
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:37,239
I've arrived at the dormitory. I'm hanging up.

476
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:41,880
Mr. Cui,

477
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:43,159
why are you here?

478
00:37:43,159 --> 00:37:44,416
Ms. Lin is in Pucheng.

479
00:37:44,416 --> 00:37:45,600
She wants to see you.

480
00:37:54,679 --> 00:37:55,840
I know what you want to talk about.

481
00:37:57,159 --> 00:37:58,599
I've made it very clear last time.

482
00:37:58,599 --> 00:38:00,119
I won't break up with him.

483
00:38:00,119 --> 00:38:01,216
Not breaking up.

484
00:38:06,119 --> 00:38:08,320
So you're going to stay with such a man?

485
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:12,599
I've had people investigate.

486
00:38:12,599 --> 00:38:15,000
Shen Juan performed very poorly in high school.

487
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,280
In the first year of high school,
he even sent someone to the hospital.

488
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:19,280
He was disciplined by the school and suspended.

489
00:38:20,719 --> 00:38:21,800
What do you like

490
00:38:22,519 --> 00:38:23,880
about such a person?

491
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:25,440
I know what kind of person he is.

492
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:28,400
I knew it from the first day I met him.

493
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:29,679
And no matter what kind of person he is,

494
00:38:29,679 --> 00:38:30,719
I like him.

495
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:33,800
Isn't it too much for you

496
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:34,880
to investigate him in private?

497
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:36,992
Too much?

498
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:39,119
If I don't do this,

499
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:40,920
can you honestly tell me everything?

500
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:42,599
Is such a person worth your affection?

501
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:44,320
I've raised you all these years,

502
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:45,840
and you're willingly degrading yourself.

503
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:55,639
This is the information
for the exchange student program.

504
00:38:55,639 --> 00:38:56,760
Read it as soon as possible.

505
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:57,960
You're going abroad after the school starts.

506
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:00,719
How many times have I said it?
I'm not going abroad.

507
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:02,760
Can I choose my own way?

508
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:05,599
How are you going to choose?
Tell me, how are you going to choose?

509
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:07,559
You're just wasting your time.

510
00:39:07,559 --> 00:39:09,000
You'll regret this in the future.

511
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,519
Even if I regret it, it's my own business.

512
00:39:11,159 --> 00:39:12,199
It's none of your business.

513
00:39:34,639 --> 00:39:36,000
Miss, please stop.

514
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,599
What disease

515
00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:38,800
does the patient have

516
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:39,800
or what medication can't be used?

517
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:42,840
I-I-I don't know.

518
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:45,480
Then you go pay the fee first.

519
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:46,496
Okay.

520
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:00,384
<i>[Insufficient funds in the bank card.]</i>

521
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,159
Wait a moment.

522
00:40:09,056 --> 00:40:11,296
<i>[Shen Juan]</i>

523
00:40:17,024 --> 00:40:19,328
<i>[Fu Mingxiu]</i>

524
00:40:32,559 --> 00:40:33,960
Don't worry. I'll be right there.

525
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:43,392
Lin Yujing,

526
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:45,280
how is she?

527
00:40:46,239 --> 00:40:47,639
She's still in the emergency room.

528
00:40:51,159 --> 00:40:53,119
Don't worry. Don't scare yourself.

529
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:56,159
Let's wait for the doctor's diagnosis.

530
00:40:58,360 --> 00:40:59,719
Give me your mom's ID card.

531
00:40:59,719 --> 00:41:00,896
I'll go pay the fee.

532
00:41:04,119 --> 00:41:05,120
Don't worry.

533
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:18,079
Doctor, how is my mom doing?

534
00:41:18,079 --> 00:41:19,599
The patient has internal bleeding,

535
00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:21,280
but we've stopped it with fluids.

536
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:22,559
Because the medication she used

537
00:41:22,559 --> 00:41:23,800
contained sedative ingredients,

538
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:25,119
she probably won't wake up until tonight.

539
00:41:25,679 --> 00:41:27,280
You can visit her
after she's transferred to the ward.

540
00:41:28,559 --> 00:41:30,760
What caused the internal bleeding?

541
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:33,480
The situation is quite special.

542
00:41:34,159 --> 00:41:35,199
Come to my office with me.

543
00:41:40,239 --> 00:41:42,360
There's a hemangioma on the liver.

544
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:46,039
Normally, it wouldn't cause any pain,

545
00:41:46,039 --> 00:41:47,480
but this one has grown too large.

546
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:49,472
Look,

547
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:52,239
it's already pressing against the organs,

548
00:41:52,239 --> 00:41:54,119
and it could rupture at any time.

549
00:41:54,119 --> 00:41:55,320
It has to be removed as soon as possible.

550
00:41:57,239 --> 00:42:00,360
Actually, this is not a complicated surgery,

551
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:01,679
but

552
00:42:01,679 --> 00:42:04,599
the location of the hemangioma is not good.
It's close to the aorta.

553
00:42:06,519 --> 00:42:08,039
The surgery is quite risky.

554
00:42:08,559 --> 00:42:10,320
You need to be mentally prepared.

555
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:16,960
<i>How long it takes</i>

556
00:42:17,519 --> 00:42:18,760
<i>to be a real adult?</i>

557
00:42:20,039 --> 00:42:22,199
<i>For us when we were young,</i>

558
00:42:22,199 --> 00:42:25,199
<i>every minute of growing up
seemed particularly long.</i>

559
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:28,000
<i>But sometimes,</i>

560
00:42:28,519 --> 00:42:30,360
<i>it comes just in a flash</i>

561
00:42:42,213 --> 00:42:46,757
<i>♫ Love sprouts in my palm ♫</i>

562
00:42:48,069 --> 00:42:51,909
<i>♫ Yet worried linger within my eyes ♫</i>

563
00:42:53,701 --> 00:42:58,277
<i>♫ Our story hasn't ended ♫</i>

564
00:42:59,205 --> 00:43:02,885
<i>♫ So where are we now ♫</i>

565
00:43:04,709 --> 00:43:10,373
<i>♫ I want to hug you so badly ♫</i>

566
00:43:10,373 --> 00:43:14,437
<i>♫ I want to become better with you ♫</i>

567
00:43:15,685 --> 00:43:20,549
<i>♫ The youth we shared ♫</i>

568
00:43:20,549 --> 00:43:26,597
<i>♫ Turned into a rainbow within my heart ♫</i>

569
00:43:27,109 --> 00:43:32,677
<i>♫ I really want to warm you ♫</i>

570
00:43:32,677 --> 00:43:34,565
<i>♫ I want to share with you ♫</i>

571
00:43:34,565 --> 00:43:39,237
<i>♫ The beauty of the world ♫</i>

572
00:43:40,121 --> 00:43:42,341
<i>♫ We promised ♫</i>

573
00:43:42,917 --> 00:43:48,613
<i>♫ To never be apart ♫</i>

574
00:43:49,349 --> 00:43:55,051
<i>♫ Do you want to hear me sing ♫</i>

575
00:43:55,051 --> 00:43:59,813
<i>♫ The wind chime swaying in my heart ♫</i>

576
00:44:00,357 --> 00:44:04,581
<i>♫ Is a wish ♫</i>

577
00:44:05,317 --> 00:44:11,205
<i>♫ I secretly made for you ♫</i>

578
00:44:11,749 --> 00:44:17,285
<i>♫ I want to plant ♫</i>

579
00:44:17,285 --> 00:44:19,173
<i>♫ A red maple forest ♫</i>

580
00:44:19,173 --> 00:44:23,781
<i>♫ To dye the whole mountain red ♫</i>

581
00:44:24,709 --> 00:44:26,949
<i>♫ The sky after the rain ♫</i>

582
00:44:27,589 --> 00:44:32,517
<i>♫ Was painted by our brilliant dreams ♫</i>

583
00:44:39,397 --> 00:44:44,165
<i>♫ Time is a flower of dream ♫</i>

584
00:44:44,997 --> 00:44:50,083
<i>♫ You've already collected it ♫</i>

585
00:44:51,013 --> 00:44:55,013
<i>♫ When we all become better ♫</i>

586
00:44:56,485 --> 00:45:00,613
<i>♫ We'll see the best of the world together ♫</i>
