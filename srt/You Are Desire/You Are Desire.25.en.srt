<i>[Episode 25 I Follow My Own Path]</i>

19
00:01:34,195 --> 00:01:35,875
After doing so many bad things,

20
00:01:35,875 --> 00:01:37,715
you have the audacity to put this photo
on the table.

21
00:01:40,554 --> 00:01:41,554
I understand now.

22
00:01:42,354 --> 00:01:44,195
Shen Juan himself doesn't dare to face me,

23
00:01:44,794 --> 00:01:45,995
so he found you

24
00:01:46,514 --> 00:01:47,594
to stand up for him.

25
00:01:49,274 --> 00:01:50,307
You're overthinking.

26
00:01:50,995 --> 00:01:52,594
Shen Juan doesn't even know about this.

27
00:01:53,314 --> 00:01:54,915
I came here

28
00:01:54,915 --> 00:01:57,074
because we still have an old score to settle.

29
00:02:04,715 --> 00:02:07,155
You sent the disciplinary notice
of Shen Juan to my mom, right?

30
00:02:07,834 --> 00:02:09,114
What were you playing at?

31
00:02:11,955 --> 00:02:13,123
I was just trying to help.

32
00:02:13,635 --> 00:02:15,074
I kindly reminded your mom

33
00:02:16,114 --> 00:02:17,875
to see clearly as soon as possible

34
00:02:17,875 --> 00:02:20,475
the kind of person her daughter was dating

35
00:02:21,074 --> 00:02:23,314
so that she would not be deceived

36
00:02:23,314 --> 00:02:26,235
or see her own daughter sinking into misery.

37
00:02:26,915 --> 00:02:29,155
Shen Juan is upright and innocent.

38
00:02:29,155 --> 00:02:30,675
I know him best.

39
00:02:30,675 --> 00:02:31,875
I don't need you to distort the truth.

40
00:02:32,875 --> 00:02:36,114
As for you, you're like a rat in the sewer,

41
00:02:36,114 --> 00:02:38,834
only capable of doing bad things
behind people's backs. How disgusting.

42
00:02:39,754 --> 00:02:41,235
Shen Juan is upright and innocent.

43
00:02:42,995 --> 00:02:44,579
Then who was the one who killed my master?

44
00:02:45,155 --> 00:02:46,514
And who was the one who hit me?

45
00:02:47,114 --> 00:02:48,483
I told everyone what he did.

46
00:02:48,483 --> 00:02:49,554
What did I do wrong?

47
00:02:58,074 --> 00:02:59,435
I grew up

48
00:02:59,435 --> 00:03:00,754
with my uncle,

49
00:03:01,475 --> 00:03:03,754
and he was the most important person to me.

50
00:03:05,074 --> 00:03:06,371
Back in the day,

51
00:03:06,371 --> 00:03:07,875
in order to rush
to see my shooting competition,

52
00:03:08,675 --> 00:03:09,731
he had a car accident

53
00:03:10,354 --> 00:03:11,354
and became a vegetable.

54
00:03:13,274 --> 00:03:15,274
In the end, I found out that this accident

55
00:03:16,354 --> 00:03:17,675
was related to a person.

56
00:03:19,274 --> 00:03:21,875
So I lost control and hit him.

57
00:03:21,875 --> 00:03:24,514
In other words, under extreme emotions,

58
00:03:24,514 --> 00:03:25,955
you do have overreactions.

59
00:03:32,074 --> 00:03:33,155
Yes.

60
00:03:34,635 --> 00:03:36,715
I admit I didn't control my emotions well,

61
00:03:37,875 --> 00:03:38,915
but it only happened once.

62
00:03:40,354 --> 00:03:41,411
You're honest.

63
00:03:42,195 --> 00:03:44,771
But how can you guarantee
it won't happen again?

64
00:03:45,314 --> 00:03:46,979
After all, firearms are involved.

65
00:03:47,514 --> 00:03:49,435
The risk is quite high.

66
00:03:53,675 --> 00:03:55,074
I've overcome my negative emotions.

67
00:03:55,834 --> 00:03:57,034
When my uncle passed away,

68
00:03:58,395 --> 00:03:59,395
I didn't get angry

69
00:04:00,235 --> 00:04:01,507
or feel rage

70
00:04:01,507 --> 00:04:02,635
or despair.

71
00:04:04,554 --> 00:04:05,603
It was because of someone

72
00:04:07,235 --> 00:04:08,354
I'd met.

73
00:04:09,475 --> 00:04:11,195
When I once gave up on myself,

74
00:04:12,715 --> 00:04:14,074
she ignored my resistance

75
00:04:15,395 --> 00:04:17,155
and pulled me out of my downfall.

76
00:04:20,915 --> 00:04:22,314
It was she who showed me

77
00:04:23,715 --> 00:04:25,074
there were still many people caring about me

78
00:04:26,475 --> 00:04:27,675
and many things

79
00:04:28,274 --> 00:04:29,274
worth cherishing.

80
00:04:30,435 --> 00:04:33,155
So why did you leave the shooting team

81
00:04:33,155 --> 00:04:34,475
and then return to it?

82
00:04:39,314 --> 00:04:40,594
Because at that time I thought

83
00:04:42,274 --> 00:04:43,779
it was my persistence in shooting

84
00:04:44,354 --> 00:04:45,955
that caused my uncle's car accident.

85
00:04:47,034 --> 00:04:49,155
I didn't have the face
to pick up the gun again.

86
00:04:51,155 --> 00:04:52,354
But the person I just mentioned

87
00:04:54,354 --> 00:04:56,435
let me know that in fact, my uncle

88
00:04:56,435 --> 00:04:58,354
had always been supporting me
to continue shooting.

89
00:04:59,155 --> 00:05:00,227
So I came back.

90
00:05:01,354 --> 00:05:02,594
It's that simple?

91
00:05:04,155 --> 00:05:05,187
Yes.

92
00:05:06,435 --> 00:05:08,314
You should be clear about what you have done.

93
00:05:09,675 --> 00:05:10,675
You're unable to face it,

94
00:05:11,354 --> 00:05:12,995
so you want to blame everything on Shen Juan.

95
00:05:14,034 --> 00:05:15,274
You suffer

96
00:05:15,274 --> 00:05:16,514
and also drag Shen Juan down with you.

97
00:05:17,435 --> 00:05:19,074
When I see you, I think of a saying,

98
00:05:20,554 --> 00:05:22,034
hateful people

99
00:05:22,034 --> 00:05:23,794
do indeed have pitiful aspects.

100
00:05:25,834 --> 00:05:27,011
Pity me?

101
00:05:27,875 --> 00:05:29,514
Pity Shen Juan first.

102
00:05:30,915 --> 00:05:33,074
The person who was suspended
and expelled from the provincial team

103
00:05:33,074 --> 00:05:34,114
is not me.

104
00:05:35,034 --> 00:05:37,594
But in the end, Shen Juan deserved it.

105
00:05:39,034 --> 00:05:40,274
People should not do wrong things.

106
00:05:41,354 --> 00:05:44,274
If they do, they should pay the price.

107
00:05:44,274 --> 00:05:45,347
That is correct.

108
00:05:46,754 --> 00:05:48,074
If a person does something wrong,

109
00:05:49,114 --> 00:05:50,514
they must bear the consequences.

110
00:06:05,155 --> 00:06:06,371
<i>May I ask if this is Mr. Nie Xinghe?</i>

111
00:06:06,955 --> 00:06:07,971
It's me.

112
00:06:20,834 --> 00:06:22,235
Shooting itself

113
00:06:22,235 --> 00:06:23,435
has nothing to do with dangerous violence.

114
00:06:24,395 --> 00:06:26,114
On the contrary, it requires

115
00:06:26,114 --> 00:06:27,514
a very stable psychological state.

116
00:06:28,475 --> 00:06:29,915
If a person

117
00:06:29,915 --> 00:06:31,955
is not stable or calm,

118
00:06:32,794 --> 00:06:34,314
then they definitely can't hit the target.

119
00:06:35,274 --> 00:06:37,395
If there's something wrong
with my mental health,

120
00:06:37,395 --> 00:06:38,915
the rapid-fire team wouldn't give me a chance.

121
00:06:41,875 --> 00:06:43,034
Rapid-fire is my dream,

122
00:06:44,234 --> 00:06:46,154
and it's my promise to those who care about me.

123
00:06:47,554 --> 00:06:48,915
Please give me one chance.

124
00:06:50,435 --> 00:06:52,194
I've already wasted
the most precious four years.

125
00:06:52,755 --> 00:06:54,435
I don't want to waste another minute or second.

126
00:06:58,955 --> 00:07:01,234
I think this young man is not bad.

127
00:07:03,114 --> 00:07:04,795
- What?
<i>- After verification,</i>

128
00:07:04,795 --> 00:07:05,875
<i>you indeed did not provide</i>

129
00:07:05,875 --> 00:07:07,395
<i>trademark use authorization.</i>

130
00:07:07,395 --> 00:07:09,435
<i>Please promptly submit the information,</i>

131
00:07:09,459 --> 00:07:11,339
<i>or we will close your online store</i>

132
00:07:11,339 --> 00:07:12,419
<i>within 48 hours.</i>

133
00:07:16,138 --> 00:07:17,328
You did it,

134
00:07:17,328 --> 00:07:18,698
right?

135
00:07:19,779 --> 00:07:20,979
So what?

136
00:07:21,698 --> 00:07:22,939
Didn't you just say that?

137
00:07:23,779 --> 00:07:24,979
After people make mistakes,

138
00:07:24,979 --> 00:07:26,019
they have to bear the consequences.

139
00:07:26,939 --> 00:07:28,939
Besides,
Shen Juan is the rightful heir of Luo Qinghe.

140
00:07:29,538 --> 00:07:31,131
Without his permission,

141
00:07:31,131 --> 00:07:32,779
what right do you have
to register the trademark?

142
00:07:32,779 --> 00:07:34,139
This trademark was my master's.

143
00:07:34,698 --> 00:07:36,859
How can you judge my relationship
with my master?

144
00:07:36,859 --> 00:07:39,058
Then what right do you have
to meddle in my relationship with my mother?

145
00:07:48,379 --> 00:07:49,658
Does Shen Juan know

146
00:07:50,538 --> 00:07:52,019
what you're doing?

147
00:08:01,499 --> 00:08:02,939
That's exactly what I intended.

148
00:08:12,538 --> 00:08:14,738
Qinghe Silverware is my master's store.

149
00:08:15,499 --> 00:08:17,698
What right do you have to deprive me
of reopening it?

150
00:08:18,258 --> 00:08:19,618
For your shooting career,

151
00:08:20,178 --> 00:08:21,499
you just shut down the store.

152
00:08:22,058 --> 00:08:23,138
If I hadn't bought

153
00:08:23,138 --> 00:08:24,258
the store,

154
00:08:25,019 --> 00:08:26,538
my master's hard work
would have been long gone.

155
00:08:27,738 --> 00:08:28,819
If my uncle was still alive,

156
00:08:30,218 --> 00:08:31,859
would you dare to tell him what you've done?

157
00:08:36,299 --> 00:08:37,299
His wish

158
00:08:38,538 --> 00:08:40,019
wasn't that we inherited the silverware store

159
00:08:41,058 --> 00:08:42,899
but that we pursued our dreams.

160
00:08:45,379 --> 00:08:46,819
He was kind all his life.

161
00:08:47,899 --> 00:08:50,738
He drew inspiration
from the beauty of the world.

162
00:08:52,339 --> 00:08:53,698
But what you're doing now

163
00:08:54,618 --> 00:08:55,867
is completely against his will.

164
00:08:56,459 --> 00:08:57,819
You're not worthy of being his disciple,

165
00:08:58,339 --> 00:08:59,538
using his designs,

166
00:09:00,138 --> 00:09:02,379
let alone inheriting
the Qinghe Silverware trademark.

167
00:09:11,499 --> 00:09:13,299
If you still consider yourself his disciple,

168
00:09:14,339 --> 00:09:15,618
I advise you to get back on track.

169
00:09:22,459 --> 00:09:23,611
Let's go.

170
00:09:40,058 --> 00:09:41,379
After this incident,

171
00:09:41,379 --> 00:09:42,979
Nie Xinghe would stop causing us trouble,
right?

172
00:09:43,538 --> 00:09:45,899
The online store is closed,
and he'll have a lot of things to deal with.

173
00:09:45,899 --> 00:09:47,859
I guess he'd calm down a bit during this time.

174
00:09:49,299 --> 00:09:50,299
Go back.

175
00:09:52,499 --> 00:09:54,098
What are you going to do about the suspension?

176
00:09:55,138 --> 00:09:56,155
I'll wait for the school's notice.

177
00:09:57,299 --> 00:09:59,058
I've said everything
that needs to be said at the meeting.

178
00:10:00,258 --> 00:10:01,339
You've had it tough too,

179
00:10:02,299 --> 00:10:03,547
having to take care of your mom

180
00:10:03,547 --> 00:10:04,618
and also worrying about me.

181
00:10:05,419 --> 00:10:08,138
Didn't we agree to face everything together?

182
00:10:08,658 --> 00:10:10,555
My mom will be discharged soon.
I'll have some time.

183
00:10:11,098 --> 00:10:12,819
Shall we go relax ourselves?

184
00:10:13,698 --> 00:10:14,715
Okay.

185
00:10:15,895 --> 00:10:17,890
<i>[Inpatient Department]</i>

186
00:10:19,899 --> 00:10:21,051
I'll go with you.

187
00:10:21,779 --> 00:10:23,003
You just wait here.

188
00:10:23,003 --> 00:10:24,819
I'll put the stuff in the car
and come pick you up.

189
00:10:36,058 --> 00:10:37,538
The car I ordered is downstairs.

190
00:10:37,538 --> 00:10:38,538
I've visited the hotel
where your mom will stay,

191
00:10:38,538 --> 00:10:39,859
and the place is good.

192
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:43,058
It's great to have you here.

193
00:10:44,499 --> 00:10:46,058
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

194
00:10:55,178 --> 00:10:58,258
Mom, Mr. Cui has already booked
your ticket back to Huaicheng.

195
00:10:58,258 --> 00:10:59,538
He will come to pick you up.

196
00:11:00,379 --> 00:11:01,538
I know.

197
00:11:01,538 --> 00:11:02,618
Stop tidying up and come here.

198
00:11:02,618 --> 00:11:03,698
I want to talk to you.

199
00:11:12,538 --> 00:11:13,698
I saw Shen Juan

200
00:11:14,419 --> 00:11:15,459
at the hospital today.

201
00:11:16,658 --> 00:11:19,867
I know the reason
my previous check-ups went so smoothly

202
00:11:20,443 --> 00:11:22,178
was because he made a medical appointment early

203
00:11:23,979 --> 00:11:25,019
and it helped a lot.

204
00:11:27,138 --> 00:11:28,538
I used to

205
00:11:28,538 --> 00:11:29,627
have a bad opinion of Shen Juan.

206
00:11:30,339 --> 00:11:31,819
Unexpectedly,

207
00:11:31,819 --> 00:11:33,098
he doesn't evade when faced with problems

208
00:11:34,098 --> 00:11:35,258
and is so resolute.

209
00:11:38,218 --> 00:11:40,258
Those comments about him
on the Internet are rumors,

210
00:11:40,939 --> 00:11:42,658
mostly misunderstandings.

211
00:11:43,859 --> 00:11:44,955
If you get to know him a bit more,

212
00:11:45,499 --> 00:11:46,555
you'll actually find

213
00:11:47,138 --> 00:11:48,779
he's a really good person.

214
00:11:50,658 --> 00:11:51,739
Yes,

215
00:11:54,939 --> 00:11:56,939
he's more responsible than Meng Weiguo.

216
00:12:03,939 --> 00:12:06,058
I was at your age too

217
00:12:06,899 --> 00:12:08,138
when I met Meng Weiguo.

218
00:12:09,058 --> 00:12:10,459
At that time,

219
00:12:11,058 --> 00:12:12,138
I was a naive freshman.

220
00:12:13,299 --> 00:12:14,658
And

221
00:12:16,779 --> 00:12:17,819
because I was shallow,

222
00:12:17,819 --> 00:12:19,538
I was attracted by his appearance.

223
00:12:21,379 --> 00:12:22,738
Back then, I brought Meng Weiguo

224
00:12:22,738 --> 00:12:23,819
to meet your grandfather.

225
00:12:24,738 --> 00:12:26,939
He didn't agree with us being together,

226
00:12:26,939 --> 00:12:28,019
but I insisted.

227
00:12:28,618 --> 00:12:29,698
I was silly.

228
00:12:29,698 --> 00:12:31,138
I thought that for him,

229
00:12:31,138 --> 00:12:32,698
even if I lost the whole world,

230
00:12:34,138 --> 00:12:35,339
that was what love is.

231
00:12:39,459 --> 00:12:40,698
Later, we got married.

232
00:12:41,419 --> 00:12:43,819
I was extremely busy with work every day,

233
00:12:44,979 --> 00:12:47,339
pressuring myself a lot.

234
00:12:48,339 --> 00:12:49,939
I thought he would support me.

235
00:12:51,218 --> 00:12:52,283
Unexpectedly,

236
00:12:52,979 --> 00:12:56,098
he was totally lost in his fantasy
of being a writer.

237
00:12:57,419 --> 00:12:58,738
He thought I was vulgar.

238
00:13:00,779 --> 00:13:02,379
We couldn't communicate at all.

239
00:13:03,459 --> 00:13:04,658
After getting married,

240
00:13:06,178 --> 00:13:07,218
Meng Weiguo

241
00:13:07,218 --> 00:13:08,299
never walked up to your grandfather

242
00:13:10,939 --> 00:13:12,459
to say

243
00:13:12,459 --> 00:13:14,339
he loved me

244
00:13:14,339 --> 00:13:15,451
and would strive for our future.

245
00:13:20,379 --> 00:13:21,859
But Shen Juan is different.

246
00:13:23,258 --> 00:13:24,658
He came up to me,

247
00:13:25,738 --> 00:13:27,058
saying he would give you a future.

248
00:13:28,939 --> 00:13:30,299
The you in his eyes

249
00:13:31,299 --> 00:13:32,859
and the you I know

250
00:13:32,859 --> 00:13:34,258
are completely different.

251
00:13:41,459 --> 00:13:43,138
He said that you had a lot of ideas,

252
00:13:43,939 --> 00:13:45,098
and when faced with problems,

253
00:13:45,098 --> 00:13:46,459
you always shouldered them yourself,

254
00:13:47,459 --> 00:13:48,538
never asking for help.

255
00:13:50,339 --> 00:13:51,899
That was the moment I realized

256
00:13:53,939 --> 00:13:55,178
that you had grown up.

257
00:14:03,316 --> 00:14:04,405
Yu.

258
00:14:05,116 --> 00:14:06,476
I used to think

259
00:14:07,316 --> 00:14:08,517
that you were still a child.

260
00:14:11,276 --> 00:14:13,077
I was afraid that you'd be fooled,

261
00:14:13,077 --> 00:14:15,157
so I arranged everything for you.

262
00:14:16,196 --> 00:14:17,556
Now, I can finally rest assured.

263
00:14:19,797 --> 00:14:21,116
I was overthinking.

264
00:14:22,437 --> 00:14:23,756
You've grown up.

265
00:14:25,676 --> 00:14:27,597
It's time for me to let go.

266
00:14:32,157 --> 00:14:33,877
From now on,

267
00:14:33,877 --> 00:14:35,357
I won't meddle in your affairs.

268
00:14:36,436 --> 00:14:37,676
I hope

269
00:14:39,436 --> 00:14:41,077
you can think carefully

270
00:14:42,276 --> 00:14:43,757
about which path to take

271
00:14:43,757 --> 00:14:44,757
in the future.

272
00:14:48,317 --> 00:14:49,333
Mom,

273
00:14:50,396 --> 00:14:51,396
I will think

274
00:14:52,237 --> 00:14:53,876
about my future carefully.

275
00:15:11,517 --> 00:15:13,237
This is a gift for the Guan family.

276
00:15:15,197 --> 00:15:16,637
Thank Meng Weiguo for me.

277
00:15:17,156 --> 00:15:18,517
I've settled my debts with him.

278
00:15:19,797 --> 00:15:22,396
No matter how you get on with him,

279
00:15:23,477 --> 00:15:24,477
it's up to you.

280
00:15:28,596 --> 00:15:29,813
Mom,

281
00:15:31,716 --> 00:15:33,917
can I give you a hug?

282
00:15:44,596 --> 00:15:45,685
Mom,

283
00:15:46,317 --> 00:15:48,917
you're the most important person
in the world to me.

284
00:15:49,556 --> 00:15:51,477
I will surely work hard in the future.

285
00:15:52,556 --> 00:15:54,116
You take care of yourself.

286
00:15:55,357 --> 00:15:56,957
You can argue with me

287
00:15:56,957 --> 00:15:58,197
and scold me,

288
00:15:58,957 --> 00:16:00,021
but,

289
00:16:01,556 --> 00:16:03,357
I can't loss you.

290
00:16:20,156 --> 00:16:21,276
Take care of yourself.

291
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:26,421
I'm leaving.

292
00:16:35,037 --> 00:16:36,085
Go back.

293
00:17:09,236 --> 00:17:11,276
<i>When we're free,</i>

294
00:17:11,276 --> 00:17:12,716
<i>we can have meals</i>

295
00:17:12,716 --> 00:17:14,117
<i>and even open gashapon together.</i>

296
00:17:20,156 --> 00:17:21,333
You're back.

297
00:17:30,317 --> 00:17:31,317
Lin Yujing.

298
00:17:32,836 --> 00:17:34,677
I have something to ask you.

299
00:17:35,396 --> 00:17:36,405
What is it?

300
00:17:36,916 --> 00:17:38,356
Well,

301
00:17:38,356 --> 00:17:40,036
what is your brother's favorite food?

302
00:17:43,757 --> 00:17:45,916
As far as I know, he's not picky.

303
00:17:48,877 --> 00:17:50,757
Does he have any hobbies?

304
00:17:50,757 --> 00:17:52,693
He always works,

305
00:17:52,693 --> 00:17:54,077
without particular hobbies.

306
00:17:55,557 --> 00:17:56,757
Is he that boring?

307
00:17:58,957 --> 00:18:01,036
Has he ever mentioned where he wants to go?

308
00:18:01,716 --> 00:18:03,117
Gu Xia,

309
00:18:03,117 --> 00:18:05,276
how much information are you trying
to get out of me for free?

310
00:18:09,036 --> 00:18:10,077
Please.

311
00:18:10,077 --> 00:18:11,517
For me?

312
00:18:11,517 --> 00:18:12,997
Didn't you say when I want information,

313
00:18:12,997 --> 00:18:14,117
I have to treat you well?

314
00:18:15,036 --> 00:18:16,677
You have to make me happy.

315
00:18:16,677 --> 00:18:18,276
After that, I can help you.

316
00:18:18,997 --> 00:18:21,716
Okay, this beverage is for you.

317
00:18:21,716 --> 00:18:22,957
I'll buy you nice snacks later.

318
00:18:23,677 --> 00:18:24,836
Can you help me now?

319
00:18:26,716 --> 00:18:27,893
Let me think about it.

320
00:18:33,396 --> 00:18:35,197
- Fine.
- You're going to call him?

321
00:18:36,156 --> 00:18:37,173
Right now?

322
00:18:38,197 --> 00:18:39,221
It's answered.

323
00:18:39,796 --> 00:18:41,173
Brother.

324
00:18:41,173 --> 00:18:42,557
My mom went back to Huaicheng today.

325
00:18:42,557 --> 00:18:43,637
Will you be at home tomorrow?

326
00:18:43,637 --> 00:18:44,957
Can I see you at home?

327
00:18:46,677 --> 00:18:48,156
Okay, see you tomorrow.

328
00:18:48,156 --> 00:18:49,269
Bye.

329
00:18:51,677 --> 00:18:52,997
Lin Yujing.

330
00:18:52,997 --> 00:18:54,101
You did that on purpose.

331
00:19:01,596 --> 00:19:03,036
Coming.

332
00:19:07,156 --> 00:19:08,517
- Yujing.
- Aunt Guan.

333
00:19:08,517 --> 00:19:09,525
Come in.

334
00:19:11,716 --> 00:19:13,197
Give me your backpack.

335
00:19:13,197 --> 00:19:14,197
Thank you.

336
00:19:16,036 --> 00:19:18,557
Aunt Guan, this is a gift from my mom.

337
00:19:18,557 --> 00:19:20,197
Thank you for helping to find the doctor,

338
00:19:20,916 --> 00:19:22,557
and my brother also helped a lot.

339
00:19:22,557 --> 00:19:23,637
I really appreciate it.

340
00:19:24,476 --> 00:19:25,476
We're family.

341
00:19:25,476 --> 00:19:27,061
No need of the formality.

342
00:19:27,061 --> 00:19:28,085
Where's my dad?

343
00:19:28,796 --> 00:19:29,957
He's cooking in the kitchen.

344
00:19:31,356 --> 00:19:32,796
He used to just give orders,

345
00:19:32,796 --> 00:19:34,396
but today he's cooking himself.

346
00:19:34,396 --> 00:19:35,596
You should eat more later.

347
00:19:48,356 --> 00:19:49,476
Brother.

348
00:19:49,476 --> 00:19:51,796
Gu Xia let me say hello for her.

349
00:19:54,156 --> 00:19:55,677
Alright,

350
00:19:56,276 --> 00:19:58,077
but why do you give me that look?

351
00:19:59,517 --> 00:20:01,156
Nothing.

352
00:20:01,156 --> 00:20:02,836
I wonder what you're thinking.

353
00:20:04,317 --> 00:20:06,036
What do you mean

354
00:20:06,036 --> 00:20:07,276
by that?

355
00:20:07,276 --> 00:20:09,156
If you have nothing to talk about,
you get some air here.

356
00:20:09,156 --> 00:20:10,276
I have things to do.

357
00:20:10,276 --> 00:20:12,197
No, I haven't finished yet.

358
00:20:13,437 --> 00:20:15,317
If you want to ask Gu Xia out,

359
00:20:15,317 --> 00:20:16,637
you have to seize the opportunity.

360
00:20:16,637 --> 00:20:17,653
Now is a good time.

361
00:20:19,637 --> 00:20:20,836
What do you mean?

362
00:20:20,836 --> 00:20:21,997
Why would I ask her out?

363
00:20:23,557 --> 00:20:24,661
Gu Xia is popular

364
00:20:24,661 --> 00:20:26,077
at school.

365
00:20:26,077 --> 00:20:28,036
If you don't seize the opportunity now,
there won't be one in the future.

366
00:20:35,036 --> 00:20:36,877
What does it have to do with me?

367
00:20:40,957 --> 00:20:43,356
When are you free lately?

368
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:46,596
Why?

369
00:20:46,596 --> 00:20:48,836
You just did me a big favor

370
00:20:48,836 --> 00:20:50,916
when my mom was ill.

371
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:51,989
I want to treat you to a meal.

372
00:20:52,596 --> 00:20:53,596
I'm glad to hear that.

373
00:20:54,677 --> 00:20:56,476
Okay, just let me know when you're free.

374
00:20:56,476 --> 00:20:57,525
Deal.

375
00:20:58,036 --> 00:20:59,276
Mingxiu, Yujing.

376
00:20:59,276 --> 00:21:00,397
Dinner is ready.

377
00:21:01,197 --> 00:21:02,197
Okay.

378
00:21:06,917 --> 00:21:08,213
- Give it to me.
- You stay out of this.

379
00:21:08,213 --> 00:21:09,237
You sit.

380
00:21:11,317 --> 00:21:13,236
Mingxiu, your coffee is good.

381
00:21:13,236 --> 00:21:14,421
You make us some coffee.

382
00:21:17,476 --> 00:21:18,517
Okay.

383
00:21:19,236 --> 00:21:21,037
Yujing, I'll go and get you some fruit.

384
00:21:21,636 --> 00:21:22,716
- Thank you.
- You're so kind.

385
00:21:29,917 --> 00:21:30,965
Dad,

386
00:21:32,596 --> 00:21:34,756
I have something to tell you.

387
00:21:45,917 --> 00:21:47,197
This room has been kept for you,

388
00:21:47,996 --> 00:21:49,116
and nothing has been moved.

389
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:52,797
Dad,

390
00:21:52,797 --> 00:21:54,261
thank you.

391
00:21:54,261 --> 00:21:56,197
If it weren't for you finding Dr. He,

392
00:21:56,197 --> 00:21:58,037
my mom's surgery
wouldn't have gone so smoothly.

393
00:21:59,836 --> 00:22:00,996
Actually, I didn't do much.

394
00:22:01,836 --> 00:22:02,836
Dr. He is a friend

395
00:22:02,836 --> 00:22:04,317
of your Aunt Guan.

396
00:22:04,876 --> 00:22:06,756
She helped me because of you.

397
00:22:07,437 --> 00:22:08,557
My mom wanted me

398
00:22:08,557 --> 00:22:10,317
to thank you on her behalf.

399
00:22:12,197 --> 00:22:13,236
She never changes.

400
00:22:14,476 --> 00:22:15,605
When thanking me,

401
00:22:16,116 --> 00:22:17,557
she needs you to relay the message.

402
00:22:21,876 --> 00:22:23,037
She also said

403
00:22:24,356 --> 00:22:26,077
you two are even.

404
00:22:33,476 --> 00:22:34,549
Dad,

405
00:22:35,236 --> 00:22:36,397
shouldn't we

406
00:22:36,397 --> 00:22:37,836
move on too?

407
00:22:44,476 --> 00:22:45,621
By the way,

408
00:22:47,836 --> 00:22:49,197
I opened a bank account for you.

409
00:22:50,037 --> 00:22:51,116
The password is your birthday.

410
00:22:53,437 --> 00:22:55,277
There are many expenses in college.

411
00:22:56,356 --> 00:22:57,957
Rest assured, this is my secret money.

412
00:23:05,317 --> 00:23:06,557
You still can't forgive me?

413
00:23:09,277 --> 00:23:10,677
Well,

414
00:23:10,677 --> 00:23:12,277
if there was anything I did wrong before,

415
00:23:13,876 --> 00:23:15,116
I will apologize to you.

416
00:23:19,957 --> 00:23:21,077
Take it.

417
00:23:27,957 --> 00:23:29,356
Dad,

418
00:23:29,356 --> 00:23:30,876
I'm not short of money now.

419
00:23:36,476 --> 00:23:37,516
In fact,

420
00:23:37,516 --> 00:23:38,996
I also did wrong in the past.

421
00:23:39,876 --> 00:23:41,429
I had my issues.

422
00:23:41,429 --> 00:23:42,485
I won't repeat them.

423
00:23:43,437 --> 00:23:45,756
I promise I will come home more often.

424
00:23:45,756 --> 00:23:46,837
Alright?

425
00:23:50,397 --> 00:23:51,445
Yujing.

426
00:23:52,157 --> 00:23:53,173
Coming.

427
00:23:54,557 --> 00:23:56,356
If you want to eat anything,
tell me in advance.

428
00:23:57,277 --> 00:23:58,293
I will cook for you.

429
00:23:58,836 --> 00:24:00,596
Okay. Let's go.

430
00:24:18,876 --> 00:24:20,876
Hello, my name is He Songnan.

431
00:24:21,397 --> 00:24:23,277
I'm Xu Ruyi's boyfriend.

432
00:24:23,277 --> 00:24:25,037
Well, let's not talk here.

433
00:24:25,037 --> 00:24:26,116
Let's go in first.

434
00:24:26,116 --> 00:24:27,236
- Okay.
- Sure.

435
00:24:30,636 --> 00:24:31,716
We will go in first.

436
00:24:31,716 --> 00:24:32,725
Okay.

437
00:24:35,516 --> 00:24:37,797
I'm sorry to cost tonight.

438
00:24:38,836 --> 00:24:39,925
Well,

439
00:24:41,716 --> 00:24:42,836
this place looks expensive.

440
00:24:43,677 --> 00:24:44,789
I'm nice to your roommates,

441
00:24:44,789 --> 00:24:45,836
so if anything happens to you,

442
00:24:45,836 --> 00:24:47,636
they can inform me.

443
00:24:47,636 --> 00:24:49,077
And I get a discount at this restaurant.

444
00:24:49,077 --> 00:24:50,636
Don't worry. It won't cost me much.

445
00:24:52,557 --> 00:24:53,621
Well, alright.

446
00:24:54,917 --> 00:24:56,157
Then let's split the bill.

447
00:24:57,197 --> 00:24:58,229
Is that okay?

448
00:24:58,756 --> 00:24:59,917
Okay, no problem.

449
00:25:01,516 --> 00:25:02,557
Let's go in then.

450
00:25:02,557 --> 00:25:03,605
Sure.

451
00:25:15,397 --> 00:25:16,836
We had a great time today.

452
00:25:16,836 --> 00:25:18,957
Thank you for the dinner.

453
00:25:19,876 --> 00:25:22,197
You're welcome, and I should thank you

454
00:25:22,197 --> 00:25:23,756
for taking care of Ruyi.

455
00:25:23,756 --> 00:25:24,789
Don't worry.

456
00:25:24,789 --> 00:25:26,636
We will take good care of Ruyi for you.

457
00:25:27,356 --> 00:25:28,677
We won't disturb you anymore.

458
00:25:28,677 --> 00:25:29,797
Bye.

459
00:25:34,236 --> 00:25:36,077
Why did you pay the bill by yourself just now?

460
00:25:36,077 --> 00:25:37,109
How much was it?

461
00:25:40,476 --> 00:25:42,516
Only 355 for four people?

462
00:25:42,516 --> 00:25:43,557
Right, it's not expensive.

463
00:25:44,756 --> 00:25:46,197
I'll transfer money to you.

464
00:25:46,197 --> 00:25:47,236
We agreed to split it.

465
00:25:47,236 --> 00:25:48,317
No rush.

466
00:25:48,317 --> 00:25:49,876
I'll see you every weekend from now on,

467
00:25:49,876 --> 00:25:51,677
and you can treat me to a milk tea each time.

468
00:25:51,677 --> 00:25:52,725
You can pay me back slowly.

469
00:25:54,356 --> 00:25:55,445
Well, alright.

470
00:25:55,957 --> 00:25:57,797
I have to go.

471
00:25:58,356 --> 00:25:59,477
Okay.

472
00:26:12,277 --> 00:26:14,356
He's so handsome. I think he's a good man.

473
00:26:14,356 --> 00:26:16,157
She's back.

474
00:26:17,317 --> 00:26:18,357
Ask her.

475
00:26:19,356 --> 00:26:21,317
After our unanimous review,

476
00:26:21,317 --> 00:26:22,917
your boyfriend has passed our test.

477
00:26:23,557 --> 00:26:25,077
He's reliable and considerate.

478
00:26:25,077 --> 00:26:26,277
He's very attentive to you.

479
00:26:26,957 --> 00:26:28,116
And he's generous.

480
00:26:28,917 --> 00:26:30,037
It's hard

481
00:26:30,037 --> 00:26:31,836
to find such a good boyfriend.

482
00:26:32,397 --> 00:26:33,957
The food was really delicious.

483
00:26:35,236 --> 00:26:37,157
I've been wanting to try it.

484
00:26:37,157 --> 00:26:38,236
It's too expensive.

485
00:26:39,157 --> 00:26:40,797
After we ordered so many dishes,

486
00:26:40,797 --> 00:26:42,965
your boyfriend didn't even frown.

487
00:26:42,965 --> 00:26:44,157
He's really a good person.

488
00:26:44,157 --> 00:26:45,996
That restaurant has a group discount.

489
00:26:45,996 --> 00:26:47,957
If you want, we can eat again.

490
00:26:48,596 --> 00:26:49,717
Group discount?

491
00:26:50,356 --> 00:26:51,476
Impossible.

492
00:26:51,476 --> 00:26:53,596
I've been following that restaurant.

493
00:26:53,596 --> 00:26:55,836
There's no such group discount.

494
00:27:17,197 --> 00:27:18,317
Hello.

495
00:27:18,317 --> 00:27:20,397
May I ask how much the table ten

496
00:27:20,397 --> 00:27:21,636
spent?

497
00:27:40,356 --> 00:27:41,685
<i>I just found out</i>

498
00:27:41,685 --> 00:27:43,996
<i>that today's meal cost you 1355.</i>

499
00:27:43,996 --> 00:27:46,317
<i>I'm sorry for costing you so much.</i>

500
00:27:46,317 --> 00:27:47,557
<i>I'll transfer 500 to you first.</i>

501
00:27:47,557 --> 00:27:48,677
<i>As for the rest of money,</i>

502
00:27:48,677 --> 00:27:49,996
<i>I'll transfer it to you</i>

503
00:27:49,996 --> 00:27:51,061
<i>when I get my part-time job wages.</i>

504
00:27:54,476 --> 00:27:55,797
Ruyi,

505
00:27:55,797 --> 00:27:57,116
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

506
00:27:57,116 --> 00:27:58,516
<i>I didn't mean to deceive you.</i>

507
00:28:00,157 --> 00:28:01,596
I didn't expect

508
00:28:01,596 --> 00:28:03,957
this meal would cost you so much.

509
00:28:03,957 --> 00:28:05,516
I chose this restaurant,

510
00:28:05,516 --> 00:28:06,716
and tonight was my treat.

511
00:28:07,277 --> 00:28:09,397
I'm your boyfriend. That's what I should do.

512
00:28:11,236 --> 00:28:13,476
We agreed to split the bill before,

513
00:28:13,476 --> 00:28:14,716
so you must accept my money.

514
00:28:16,957 --> 00:28:18,101
Okay.

515
00:28:35,596 --> 00:28:36,957
I know I shouldn't lie to her.

516
00:28:37,677 --> 00:28:38,797
I apologized to her.

517
00:28:39,557 --> 00:28:40,677
Even if she argues with me

518
00:28:40,677 --> 00:28:41,797
or scolds me, that's okay.

519
00:28:42,476 --> 00:28:43,917
But she apologized first.

520
00:28:45,516 --> 00:28:46,596
What does it mean

521
00:28:46,596 --> 00:28:48,236
for us to apologize to each other?

522
00:28:54,476 --> 00:28:55,677
Why are you not speaking?

523
00:28:58,636 --> 00:29:00,157
Whatever you want to say, just say it to me.

524
00:29:00,756 --> 00:29:01,813
I'm listening.

525
00:29:05,037 --> 00:29:06,157
I'm not worried to argue,

526
00:29:06,876 --> 00:29:08,317
but I'm just afraid she gets silent.

527
00:29:08,317 --> 00:29:09,397
She keeps everything in her heart.

528
00:29:09,397 --> 00:29:10,996
I don't even know what she's thinking.

529
00:29:15,957 --> 00:29:17,077
I'm telling you.

530
00:29:19,197 --> 00:29:20,476
Since you like her

531
00:29:21,836 --> 00:29:23,356
and want to be with her,

532
00:29:25,037 --> 00:29:27,157
you have to put yourself in her shoes.

533
00:29:27,157 --> 00:29:29,716
You two should try to understand each other.

534
00:29:30,596 --> 00:29:31,765
Got it?

535
00:29:37,437 --> 00:29:38,453
Come on.

536
00:29:48,957 --> 00:29:50,005
I'm back.

537
00:29:53,637 --> 00:29:54,677
What are you doing?

538
00:29:57,437 --> 00:29:58,957
You want to hang out?

539
00:29:58,957 --> 00:30:00,877
I want to hang out
with Shen Juan on the weekend.

540
00:30:01,556 --> 00:30:02,996
This is your first time
hanging out together, right?

541
00:30:03,597 --> 00:30:05,357
You should pick a fun place.

542
00:30:05,357 --> 00:30:06,877
I know a restaurant

543
00:30:06,877 --> 00:30:08,117
on top of a mountain outside the city.

544
00:30:08,117 --> 00:30:09,236
I'll send you the location.

545
00:30:09,236 --> 00:30:10,485
The scenery there is really good.

546
00:30:10,485 --> 00:30:12,117
You can see the entire cityscape.

547
00:30:12,117 --> 00:30:13,117
It's very romantic.

548
00:30:13,917 --> 00:30:14,997
Did you receive it?

549
00:30:18,677 --> 00:30:19,917
It's pretty romantic,

550
00:30:22,157 --> 00:30:24,637
but I want to find a place
where you can shop and play.

551
00:30:25,637 --> 00:30:27,437
A place to shop and play…

552
00:30:30,917 --> 00:30:32,236
How about this one?

553
00:30:32,236 --> 00:30:34,293
Nanfeng Island. I've been there before.

554
00:30:34,293 --> 00:30:36,036
It's convenient to get there from Pucheng.

555
00:30:36,036 --> 00:30:38,236
There's a really artistic street

556
00:30:38,236 --> 00:30:40,516
full of craft workshops and pottery galleries.

557
00:30:40,516 --> 00:30:42,677
Look, it's perfect for couples.

558
00:30:43,236 --> 00:30:44,316
Looks nice.

559
00:30:44,917 --> 00:30:46,837
We'll go here. Thanks for your recommendation.

560
00:30:49,996 --> 00:30:51,117
Let me give you a surprise.

561
00:30:52,677 --> 00:30:53,749
What surprise?

562
00:31:11,236 --> 00:31:13,397
I got you snacks.

563
00:31:15,076 --> 00:31:16,157
You grab the opportunity.

564
00:31:17,197 --> 00:31:18,197
No problem.

565
00:31:39,397 --> 00:31:40,437
Mr. Fu.

566
00:31:40,437 --> 00:31:41,756
What a coincidence.

567
00:31:41,756 --> 00:31:42,917
You're also here to climb the mountain?

568
00:31:44,316 --> 00:31:45,316
Why are you here?

569
00:31:46,437 --> 00:31:47,516
Are you waiting for someone?

570
00:31:48,516 --> 00:31:50,597
It's already late.

571
00:31:50,597 --> 00:31:52,397
Got stood up, huh?

572
00:31:53,157 --> 00:31:54,837
Don't be silly.

573
00:32:01,197 --> 00:32:03,837
<i>I can't make it. I have something else to do.</i>

574
00:32:03,837 --> 00:32:05,813
<i>This restaurant is hard to book.</i>

575
00:32:05,813 --> 00:32:06,917
<i>You eat by yourself.</i>

576
00:32:08,877 --> 00:32:10,756
I don't mind if someone wants
to climb the mountain with me.

577
00:32:13,276 --> 00:32:14,597
I'll climb alone.

578
00:32:14,597 --> 00:32:15,597
Okay.

579
00:32:15,597 --> 00:32:17,556
I'll follow behind you.

580
00:32:23,437 --> 00:32:24,533
<i>We've met now.</i>

581
00:32:28,516 --> 00:32:30,677
<i>The rest is up to you.</i>

582
00:32:38,837 --> 00:32:40,357
Why didn't you
answer your brother's call just now?

583
00:32:41,117 --> 00:32:42,837
A good helper knows

584
00:32:42,837 --> 00:32:43,877
when to appear

585
00:32:43,877 --> 00:32:45,036
and when not to.

586
00:32:46,397 --> 00:32:47,445
I'm sorry.

587
00:32:48,397 --> 00:32:49,996
There's a problem with our system.

588
00:32:49,996 --> 00:32:51,796
The room you booked is already occupied,

589
00:32:52,796 --> 00:32:54,236
and we have no other empty rooms.

590
00:32:58,877 --> 00:33:00,996
The island is hosting a tourism festival,

591
00:33:00,996 --> 00:33:02,437
so a lot of travelers is rushing in.

592
00:33:02,437 --> 00:33:03,957
All the hotels on the island are full.

593
00:33:04,677 --> 00:33:05,717
I'm really sorry.

594
00:33:09,236 --> 00:33:11,117
So, should we go back?

595
00:33:13,036 --> 00:33:14,516
However, there is a tent

596
00:33:14,516 --> 00:33:15,957
on the beach.

597
00:33:15,957 --> 00:33:17,516
If you don't mind,

598
00:33:17,516 --> 00:33:18,597
I'll let you stay for free

599
00:33:19,637 --> 00:33:21,516
and notify you when there's a room tomorrow.

600
00:33:21,516 --> 00:33:22,613
Only one tent?

601
00:33:39,076 --> 00:33:41,996
Lin Yujing didn't tell me
I have to climb the mountain for dinner?

602
00:33:44,556 --> 00:33:47,877
It's okay. There's a good restaurant
on top of the mountain.

603
00:33:47,877 --> 00:33:49,236
Lin Yujing

604
00:33:49,236 --> 00:33:51,076
should have come with me.

605
00:33:51,076 --> 00:33:52,341
Luckily, she didn't come today,

606
00:33:52,341 --> 00:33:53,516
or, we wouldn't be able to make it.

607
00:33:54,276 --> 00:33:56,117
You guys just lack exercise.

608
00:33:56,796 --> 00:33:57,957
Look.

609
00:33:57,957 --> 00:33:59,877
The old couple ahead
are climbing faster than you.

610
00:34:04,917 --> 00:34:05,973
Mr. Fu.

611
00:34:07,197 --> 00:34:08,716
I'm really tired.

612
00:34:08,716 --> 00:34:09,781
Can't climb any more.

613
00:34:12,556 --> 00:34:14,917
Then I'll hold you.

614
00:34:14,917 --> 00:34:15,957
Fine.

615
00:34:37,036 --> 00:34:38,069
My legs are about to break.

616
00:34:38,677 --> 00:34:40,157
I won't be able to walk tomorrow.

617
00:34:49,756 --> 00:34:51,637
You sure your legs are about to break?

618
00:34:59,117 --> 00:35:01,197
Hi, do you want to buy a love lock?

619
00:35:01,197 --> 00:35:03,236
It helps fulfill your wishes.

620
00:35:03,236 --> 00:35:06,877
Lovers who hang love locks
will be together forever.

621
00:35:06,877 --> 00:35:07,893
We are not a couple.

622
00:35:08,397 --> 00:35:09,597
We're just climbing the mountain together.

623
00:35:10,877 --> 00:35:12,236
I see.

624
00:35:12,236 --> 00:35:13,677
You two can buy a lock together.

625
00:35:13,677 --> 00:35:15,276
How much is it? I'll buy it.

626
00:35:15,276 --> 00:35:16,277
100 yuan.

627
00:35:20,357 --> 00:35:21,365
Done.

628
00:35:22,957 --> 00:35:24,021
Thank you.

629
00:35:25,316 --> 00:35:27,117
Just make one wish. It works.

630
00:35:27,716 --> 00:35:29,556
It's not just for couples.

631
00:35:36,357 --> 00:35:37,556
Write down your wish.

632
00:36:22,996 --> 00:36:24,021
Aren't you going to hang one?

633
00:36:25,516 --> 00:36:27,036
I haven't thought about what wish to make.

634
00:36:27,036 --> 00:36:28,157
I'll hang it later.

635
00:36:30,677 --> 00:36:32,837
The restaurant at the top
of the mountain is pretty good.

636
00:36:33,357 --> 00:36:35,957
I'm too tired.
If I don't eat anything, I can't climb down.

637
00:36:37,756 --> 00:36:40,981
I've made a reservation in that restaurant.

638
00:36:40,981 --> 00:36:42,516
Thanks for your treat.

639
00:37:00,662 --> 00:37:05,941
<i>[Fu Mingxiu, Gu Xia]</i>

640
00:37:23,357 --> 00:37:26,076
I'll find another place to sleep tonight?

641
00:37:26,837 --> 00:37:28,716
No, since we came out together,

642
00:37:28,716 --> 00:37:29,716
let's do things together.

643
00:37:30,597 --> 00:37:32,637
This tent has enough room for two people.

644
00:37:36,036 --> 00:37:37,357
Let's go and play.

645
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:03,061
<i>I used to love the night,</i>

646
00:39:03,820 --> 00:39:05,180
<i>sitting alone quietly</i>

647
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:08,380
<i>and polishing the silver ornament.</i>

648
00:39:09,141 --> 00:39:11,260
<i>I throw away worries in the past.</i>

649
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:13,780
<i>Now that I have you,</i>

650
00:39:15,061 --> 00:39:16,541
<i>I prefer to see the light.</i>

651
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:18,461
<i>I take you to watch the sunrise,</i>

652
00:39:19,021 --> 00:39:21,141
<i>seeing the sun rising from the sea.</i>

653
00:39:22,421 --> 00:39:23,660
<i>It looks as shining</i>

654
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:25,349
<i>as our future.</i>

655
00:39:40,938 --> 00:39:45,482

00:39:46,794 --> 00:39:50,634

00:40:19,274 --> 00:40:25,322
