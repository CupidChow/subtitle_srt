19
00:02:35,376 --> 00:02:36,400
Fu Mingxiu.

20
00:02:40,896 --> 00:02:42,176
Let's go.

21
00:02:42,176 --> 00:02:43,216
Come on.

22
00:03:33,295 --> 00:03:34,352
Mr. Fu.

23
00:03:35,416 --> 00:03:37,616
When you gave me the gashapon before,

24
00:03:37,616 --> 00:03:39,336
you said we could have a meal

25
00:03:39,336 --> 00:03:40,376
and play with gashapon together.

26
00:03:40,935 --> 00:03:42,032
Is that still valid?

27
00:03:45,616 --> 00:03:46,640
It is.

28
00:03:47,975 --> 00:03:49,656
Actually,

29
00:03:49,656 --> 00:03:51,576
I asked Lin Yujing to ask you out for me.

30
00:03:55,215 --> 00:03:56,856
We can climb mountains and have a meal.

31
00:03:57,975 --> 00:04:00,495
Just be direct

32
00:04:01,215 --> 00:04:02,455
I'll say it directly.

33
00:04:04,215 --> 00:04:05,336
Mr. Fu.

34
00:04:05,336 --> 00:04:07,295
I like you, so I want to chase you.

35
00:04:10,576 --> 00:04:11,600
Are you okay?

36
00:04:13,656 --> 00:04:14,672
I can do it myself.

37
00:04:15,656 --> 00:04:17,735
You don't need to be shy. I'll help you down.

38
00:04:19,816 --> 00:04:22,656
I'm not shy. I can do it myself.

39
00:04:33,576 --> 00:04:34,576
Ruyi.

40
00:04:38,935 --> 00:04:41,695
I've been texting you, but you never replied.

41
00:04:42,215 --> 00:04:43,775
I thought you were still angry with me.

42
00:04:44,695 --> 00:04:46,096
Why are you suddenly here?

43
00:04:47,416 --> 00:04:49,735
- I--
- I don't mean you shouldn't come.

44
00:04:50,272 --> 00:04:52,096
I mean,

45
00:04:52,096 --> 00:04:53,896
if you have something, I can go to you.

46
00:04:55,856 --> 00:04:56,935
I'm not angry.

47
00:04:57,695 --> 00:04:59,975
I've been thinking about the things between us.

48
00:05:01,576 --> 00:05:04,455
I need to say something to you in person.

49
00:05:06,535 --> 00:05:07,535
You always came

50
00:05:07,535 --> 00:05:08,775
to my school to find me.

51
00:05:09,495 --> 00:05:11,576
Today it's my turn to come to find you.

52
00:05:11,576 --> 00:05:13,735
I also want to see your usual life

53
00:05:13,735 --> 00:05:14,896
and study environment.

54
00:05:15,576 --> 00:05:18,336
And your experimental field
where you grow small tomatoes.

55
00:05:20,656 --> 00:05:21,840
I'll show it to you.

56
00:05:24,416 --> 00:05:25,856
Was it hot in the bus?

57
00:05:25,856 --> 00:05:26,896
It's fine.

58
00:05:28,096 --> 00:05:29,104
Over here.

59
00:05:31,136 --> 00:05:32,208
Be careful.

60
00:05:32,816 --> 00:05:34,295
I'm responsible for this place.

61
00:05:35,816 --> 00:05:38,176
This is where you plant tomatoes?

62
00:05:38,176 --> 00:05:39,248
Yes.

63
00:05:41,816 --> 00:05:44,295
Can you plant other things here?

64
00:05:44,295 --> 00:05:46,656
Yes, the soil has been fertilized.

65
00:05:46,656 --> 00:05:47,816
You can plant whatever you want.

66
00:05:55,295 --> 00:05:56,576
They are sunflower seeds.

67
00:05:57,975 --> 00:05:58,975
I want

68
00:05:58,975 --> 00:06:00,056
to plant them with you.

69
00:06:01,176 --> 00:06:03,176
Okay, let's do it together.

70
00:06:03,176 --> 00:06:04,240
Okay.

71
00:06:07,096 --> 00:06:08,775
I'll dig the soil, and you plant the seeds.

72
00:06:12,896 --> 00:06:14,288
Don't get your hands dirty.

73
00:06:14,288 --> 00:06:15,376
It's okay.

74
00:06:17,535 --> 00:06:19,056
I used to live in the countryside.

75
00:06:19,056 --> 00:06:21,416
There was a large sunflower field
in the backyard.

76
00:06:21,416 --> 00:06:23,215
I often took sunflower seeds

77
00:06:23,215 --> 00:06:24,272
to eat.

78
00:06:40,096 --> 00:06:41,816
- There's one last one.
- Okay.

79
00:06:59,935 --> 00:07:03,656
Ruyi, I really shouldn't have lied

80
00:07:04,576 --> 00:07:05,896
to you.

81
00:07:11,176 --> 00:07:12,255
Look at these seedlings.

82
00:07:13,056 --> 00:07:14,975
Although they are the same type,

83
00:07:15,695 --> 00:07:17,616
because of different growing environments,

84
00:07:17,616 --> 00:07:19,376
the fruits they produce are different.

85
00:07:20,336 --> 00:07:21,656
We're the same.

86
00:07:22,896 --> 00:07:25,056
We grew up in different places,

87
00:07:25,056 --> 00:07:26,960
and our ways and thoughts are different.

88
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,096
This is normal

89
00:07:28,695 --> 00:07:29,776
and hard to change.

90
00:07:33,376 --> 00:07:35,416
I've been thinking a lot these days.

91
00:07:37,136 --> 00:07:39,416
We can't remove these differences,

92
00:07:40,056 --> 00:07:41,215
but,

93
00:07:41,215 --> 00:07:43,616
can't we find a middle ground?

94
00:07:44,656 --> 00:07:46,535
In that way, you're comfortable,

95
00:07:47,176 --> 00:07:48,455
and I won't feel so awkward.

96
00:07:53,248 --> 00:07:56,255
It might take a while to work out.

97
00:07:59,024 --> 00:08:00,168
However,

98
00:08:02,824 --> 00:08:04,264
I want to give it a try.

99
00:08:06,984 --> 00:08:08,008
Deal.

100
00:08:16,183 --> 00:08:17,224
Ruyi.

101
00:08:18,304 --> 00:08:19,336
Don't worry.

102
00:08:20,096 --> 00:08:21,984
I will take good care of these sunflowers

103
00:08:25,056 --> 00:08:26,440
and you.

104
00:08:51,792 --> 00:08:52,816
Shen Juan.

105
00:08:53,631 --> 00:08:55,672
I'm done. You can come in.

106
00:09:43,192 --> 00:09:44,351
Good night.

107
00:09:44,351 --> 00:09:45,456
Good night.

108
00:10:17,991 --> 00:10:19,056
Can't sleep?

109
00:10:20,911 --> 00:10:22,431
The sound of the waves is loud.

110
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:35,680
Morning.

111
00:11:42,439 --> 00:11:43,456
Morning.

112
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:47,584
Let's go.

113
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,152
To watch the sunrise.

114
00:12:03,479 --> 00:12:05,120
Actually,

115
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,040
I never looked forward
to seeing the sunrise before.

116
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,319
I thought every day's sunrise was the same.

117
00:12:11,319 --> 00:12:12,359
There's no difference.

118
00:12:14,319 --> 00:12:15,600
Now I'm looking at you.

119
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,640
You have a grand dream.

120
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,240
It seems like

121
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,600
you're a little closer
to your dream day by day.

122
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:27,279
This feeling is particularly beautiful.

123
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:31,808
You know what?

124
00:12:33,319 --> 00:12:34,999
After you talked with my mom,

125
00:12:34,999 --> 00:12:36,680
it actually had a big impact on her.

126
00:12:37,999 --> 00:12:39,439
She completely changed her view of you

127
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:41,399
and me.

128
00:12:42,999 --> 00:12:44,760
All of a sudden, she let go of me.

129
00:12:45,696 --> 00:12:47,399
Let me choose the path

130
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:48,480
I want to take.

131
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:51,799
I've been

132
00:12:51,799 --> 00:12:52,879
looking forward to it.

133
00:12:54,799 --> 00:12:56,240
But when it really happens,

134
00:12:57,359 --> 00:12:59,319
I suddenly felt a bit empty inside,

135
00:13:01,799 --> 00:13:03,520
because I don't know what to do

136
00:13:05,479 --> 00:13:07,080
and what I want to be.

137
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:09,632
It seems like

138
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:12,080
I've never really thought about it.

139
00:13:25,879 --> 00:13:26,880
Being confused is a stage

140
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,120
we must go through in life.

141
00:13:30,879 --> 00:13:33,439
I will feel frustrated and bad,

142
00:13:37,319 --> 00:13:39,040
But I won't give up like I used to.

143
00:13:42,479 --> 00:13:43,520
Do you remember

144
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,799
what you said the first time you talked

145
00:13:46,359 --> 00:13:47,360
to me about shooting?

146
00:13:47,959 --> 00:13:49,479
<i>No matter what happens,</i>

147
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,560
<i>go for what you love,</i>

148
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,720
<i>and strive for what you want.</i>

149
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,359
<i>Whatever the result is,</i>

150
00:13:58,760 --> 00:13:59,799
<i>don't be afraid</i>

151
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:01,696
<i>or escape.</i>

152
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,160
Now,

153
00:14:06,359 --> 00:14:09,160
I want to repeat it to you.

154
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,112
Don't be scared.

155
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,680
I'll always be by your side.

<i>the night is just a process.</i>

167
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:26,879
Handmade Workshop.

168
00:15:28,256 --> 00:15:30,279
I drew it myself.

169
00:15:30,879 --> 00:15:32,120
When I watched the competition before,

170
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:34,600
I noticed many contestants
had their own patterns on their guns,

171
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,959
but you didn't have.

172
00:15:35,959 --> 00:15:38,399
So I've been wanting to make it with you

173
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:40,160
It's embed on your gun

174
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,839
to accompany you in every competition.

175
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:58,240
I tried my best,

176
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,520
but I still failed.

177
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,080
It's okay.

178
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,136
How is it?

179
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:34,640
You're quite amazing.

180
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:35,808
You made it better.

181
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:38,799
Let me polish it a bit.

182
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:42,160
Wait a minute.

183
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,359
I want to add something else.

184
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:00,160
Is it okay?

185
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:23,328
I'm a bit hungry.

186
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,160
What do you want to eat?

187
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,208
Let me think.

188
00:17:32,319 --> 00:17:33,600
<i>Shen Juan.</i>

189
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,200
<i>The school has figured things out.</i>

190
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,560
<i>Starting from tomorrow,</i>

191
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:38,080
<i>you can return to the team for training.</i>

192
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,192
Thank you, Coach Lei.

193
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,592
What's wrong?

194
00:17:44,359 --> 00:17:45,720
I can go back to the team for training.

195
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:47,520
Really?

196
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,359
See, your effort pays off.

197
00:17:58,832 --> 00:18:00,393
Hurry! Hurry!

198
00:18:00,393 --> 00:18:01,777
Shen Juan is vindicated

199
00:18:01,777 --> 00:18:02,892
and is resuming training today.

200
00:18:02,892 --> 00:18:04,133
You guys stand closer later,

201
00:18:04,133 --> 00:18:05,293
and I'll hide behind you.

202
00:18:05,293 --> 00:18:07,092
When he comes, I'll set off the firecracker

203
00:18:07,092 --> 00:18:08,624
to celebrate for him.

204
00:18:08,624 --> 00:18:09,663
Stop what you're doing.

205
00:18:10,183 --> 00:18:11,223
He's already here.

206
00:18:13,343 --> 00:18:15,904
Shen Juan, why did you come so early?

207
00:18:16,464 --> 00:18:17,703
My surprise is wasted.

208
00:18:17,703 --> 00:18:18,984
What surprise?

209
00:18:21,663 --> 00:18:22,864
Well,

210
00:18:22,864 --> 00:18:24,423
at least your surprise wasn't prepared in vain.

211
00:18:28,944 --> 00:18:30,264
This is not a surprise at all.

212
00:18:31,304 --> 00:18:32,423
It's a fright.

213
00:18:49,343 --> 00:18:50,923
Don't regret missing

214
00:18:50,923 --> 00:18:52,328
the provincial team's training this time.

215
00:18:52,328 --> 00:18:53,424
Keep up the good work,

216
00:18:53,424 --> 00:18:54,863
and there will be more opportunities
in the future.

217
00:19:06,944 --> 00:19:08,024
Here. Hurry up!

218
00:19:12,264 --> 00:19:13,624
Clean up the confetti over there.

219
00:20:06,464 --> 00:20:07,656
Gather around, everyone.

220
00:20:07,656 --> 00:20:08,904
The training starts now.

221
00:20:35,335 --> 00:20:37,816
<i>Mr. Fu, I like you. I want to pursue you.</i>

222
00:20:39,575 --> 00:20:40,736
<i>Are you okay?</i>

223
00:20:59,098 --> 00:21:01,178
<i>[University Student]</i>

224
00:21:09,696 --> 00:21:12,576
<i>[Mr. Fu, how's your foot?]</i>

225
00:21:12,576 --> 00:21:13,824
<i>[Is it still hurting?]</i>

226
00:21:18,056 --> 00:21:20,016
<i>[I'm serious about what I said.]</i>

227
00:21:20,855 --> 00:21:21,935
<i>[I hope you can…]</i>

228
00:21:23,976 --> 00:21:25,196
Are you free now?

229
00:21:25,196 --> 00:21:26,456
Can we meet up?

230
00:21:26,976 --> 00:21:28,160
Sure.

231
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:29,736
See you later.

232
00:21:30,256 --> 00:21:31,696
<i>Okay, bye.</i>

233
00:21:34,095 --> 00:21:35,296
What's up? Whose call is it?

234
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:37,408
Mr. Fu's.

235
00:21:38,048 --> 00:21:39,056
That's good!

236
00:21:39,056 --> 00:21:40,376
He took the initiative to contact you.

237
00:21:40,376 --> 00:21:41,935
What's the situation between you two now?

238
00:21:42,655 --> 00:21:43,655
I…

239
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,575
I confessed to him when
we climbed the mountain the other day.

240
00:21:48,976 --> 00:21:50,240
You confessed?

241
00:21:51,655 --> 00:21:53,216
That's so you.

242
00:21:53,216 --> 00:21:54,720
So, how did it go? How did he react?

243
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:55,736
Did he agree?

244
00:21:56,256 --> 00:21:57,296
He was very shocked.

245
00:21:57,976 --> 00:21:59,072
And then,

246
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:01,016
he sprained his ankle.

247
00:22:03,135 --> 00:22:04,156
He sprained his ankle?

248
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:06,216
Did you scare him by being too straightforward?

249
00:22:06,216 --> 00:22:07,496
But I have to admire your progress.

250
00:22:07,496 --> 00:22:09,984
With my respect!

251
00:22:11,175 --> 00:22:14,876
I just blurted it out that day out of impulse.

252
00:22:14,876 --> 00:22:16,576
He just asked me to meet up.

253
00:22:16,576 --> 00:22:18,296
He probably wants to talk about this.

254
00:22:19,375 --> 00:22:20,476
I'm not sure if he'll refuse

255
00:22:20,476 --> 00:22:21,496
or agree.

256
00:22:27,808 --> 00:22:29,015
Go for it!

257
00:22:29,536 --> 00:22:30,624
I will.

258
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,241
You must be Shen Juan.

259
00:22:39,241 --> 00:22:40,341
And you are…

260
00:22:40,341 --> 00:22:41,521
I am Feng Li.

261
00:22:41,521 --> 00:22:43,001
A friend of your uncle.

262
00:22:47,081 --> 00:22:48,161
Sorry for my sudden visit.

263
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:52,361
I just returned from abroad.

264
00:22:52,361 --> 00:22:53,840
I saw the report on

265
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:56,061
the Daydreamer Silverware Exhibition online.

266
00:22:56,061 --> 00:22:58,241
So, I checked the information and came here.

267
00:22:59,721 --> 00:23:01,281
I'm not only your uncle's friend,

268
00:23:01,281 --> 00:23:02,361
but also his senior.

269
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:04,320
Although I'm only one year ahead of him,

270
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:06,421
I've always regarded him as a role model

271
00:23:06,421 --> 00:23:07,761
in terms of artistic creation.

272
00:23:12,113 --> 00:23:13,241
This bracelet is your uncle's work

273
00:23:13,241 --> 00:23:16,900
that won the New Talent Design Award.

274
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:19,041
He was only a sophomore then.

275
00:23:19,041 --> 00:23:21,201
And he was the youngest winner in history.

276
00:23:21,201 --> 00:23:23,221
So, the school made an exception
and put his work on the school's magazine cover

277
00:23:23,221 --> 00:23:27,241
which only features works of
well-known teachers.

278
00:23:28,017 --> 00:23:29,393
To be honest,

279
00:23:29,393 --> 00:23:30,961
seeing you organize an exhibition for him,

280
00:23:30,961 --> 00:23:32,201
I'm really happy.

281
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,280
We share the same thoughts.

282
00:23:35,081 --> 00:23:38,041
Qinghe's talent deserves
to be seen by more people.

283
00:23:40,337 --> 00:23:41,441
Thank you.

284
00:23:41,441 --> 00:23:42,481
Don't mention it.

285
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,881
Anyone who has seen his work

286
00:23:44,881 --> 00:23:46,560
will definitely appreciate him.

287
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:49,481
I'm here for that reason too.

288
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:52,881
I hope you can authorize Qinghe's design

289
00:23:52,881 --> 00:23:54,141
to my company,

290
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:55,377
Lifeng Jewelry.

291
00:23:55,377 --> 00:23:58,400
I will not let your uncle's hard work
go to waste.

292
00:24:00,241 --> 00:24:03,041
My company has been operating abroad for years.

293
00:24:03,641 --> 00:24:05,801
Last year we held a brand exhibition in Europe,

294
00:24:05,801 --> 00:24:07,521
which received a positive response
in the industry.

295
00:24:08,201 --> 00:24:10,620
We want to seize this opportunity
to enter the domestic market.

296
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:12,981
We have sophisticated
industrial production equipment

297
00:24:12,981 --> 00:24:14,781
and rich brand marketing experience.

298
00:24:14,781 --> 00:24:18,929
We believe we can successfully
promote Qinghe's design.

299
00:24:20,361 --> 00:24:21,560
If you're willing to cooperate,

300
00:24:22,081 --> 00:24:24,560
I will treat your uncle's work with care.

301
00:24:26,801 --> 00:24:29,921
Although he's gone forever,

302
00:24:30,641 --> 00:24:32,421
his works deserve to be passed on

303
00:24:32,421 --> 00:24:33,560
and let more people appreciate them.

304
00:24:34,641 --> 00:24:36,641
Thank you so much
for appreciating my uncle's works,

305
00:24:37,201 --> 00:24:38,840
but I can't cooperate with you.

306
00:24:42,027 --> 00:24:43,723
<i>[Feng Li]</i>

307
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:48,581
Not only will we promote Qinghe Silverware,

308
00:24:48,581 --> 00:24:50,840
but we will also offer you favorable terms.

309
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:52,801
It's not about the terms.

310
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:57,000
Look at this bracelet.

311
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:00,201
Every tiny detail has hidden patterns.

312
00:25:00,801 --> 00:25:01,881
I can imagine

313
00:25:01,881 --> 00:25:04,481
how much time my uncle spent
polishing and forging it

314
00:25:05,241 --> 00:25:07,000
to make it shine like this.

315
00:25:07,521 --> 00:25:10,000
My uncle's works are friends of time.

316
00:25:10,961 --> 00:25:12,560
They cannot be replaced by industrial machines.

317
00:25:13,761 --> 00:25:15,181
You don't have to worry about that.

318
00:25:15,181 --> 00:25:16,961
If my production process
can't meet the requirements,

319
00:25:16,961 --> 00:25:18,121
I wouldn't have come to you.

320
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,301
Rest assured.

321
00:25:20,301 --> 00:25:22,061
I won't change a single bit of his design,

322
00:25:22,061 --> 00:25:23,801
and will try my best to restore it.

323
00:25:23,801 --> 00:25:26,001
But the spirit of my uncle's works
can't be restored.

324
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:29,920
He spent his whole life focusing on handmade,

325
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:32,920
giving each piece a unique meaning.

326
00:25:38,561 --> 00:25:40,049
I don't want to go against his will.

327
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:46,193
Okay, then.

328
00:25:46,193 --> 00:25:48,800
But I still hope you can reconsider.

329
00:25:55,665 --> 00:25:57,001
Okay.

330
00:26:16,913 --> 00:26:18,001
Mr. Huang,

331
00:26:18,897 --> 00:26:20,280
that brat is too stubborn.

332
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:23,160
Let's proceed with our backup plan.

333
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:51,792
Mr. Fu,

334
00:26:54,672 --> 00:26:55,888
you came here so early.

335
00:26:55,888 --> 00:26:57,791
I'm used to arriving early.

336
00:26:58,952 --> 00:27:00,712
Are you ready to accept my confession?

337
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,452
Gu,

338
00:27:13,452 --> 00:27:15,192
based on your previous confession,

339
00:27:15,712 --> 00:27:18,072
I collected some related information

340
00:27:18,072 --> 00:27:19,712
and did some case analysis.

341
00:27:21,152 --> 00:27:23,112
Here's the feasibility analysis of us dating.

342
00:27:25,616 --> 00:27:29,072
First, here's a bar chart
showing our daily time distribution.

343
00:27:29,072 --> 00:27:30,378
As shown in the chart,

344
00:27:30,378 --> 00:27:32,554
your free time is mostly between

345
00:27:32,554 --> 00:27:34,072
eleven to one in the afternoon,

346
00:27:34,072 --> 00:27:35,691
four to five in the afternoon,

347
00:27:35,691 --> 00:27:37,452
and after eight at night.

348
00:27:37,452 --> 00:27:39,212
But usually at these times,

349
00:27:39,212 --> 00:27:41,192
I'm in meetings, in court,

350
00:27:41,192 --> 00:27:42,372
or working overtime.

351
00:27:42,372 --> 00:27:45,572
So, our overlapping time is very little.

352
00:27:45,572 --> 00:27:47,671
If there's no time,
we can make some time for each other.

353
00:27:47,671 --> 00:27:49,612
Besides, true love isn't related to

354
00:27:49,612 --> 00:27:51,271
having free time or not.

355
00:27:57,136 --> 00:27:58,512
And this one.

356
00:27:58,512 --> 00:27:59,772
In the next four years,

357
00:27:59,772 --> 00:28:01,672
our life plans are

358
00:28:01,672 --> 00:28:02,772
completely different.

359
00:28:02,772 --> 00:28:04,031
Different stages of life will cause

360
00:28:04,031 --> 00:28:06,252
our common topics to decrease.

361
00:28:06,252 --> 00:28:07,271
And we might even have

362
00:28:08,192 --> 00:28:09,432
conflict in values.

363
00:28:10,071 --> 00:28:11,920
So your conclusion is

364
00:28:12,511 --> 00:28:14,312
workers can only date workers,

365
00:28:14,312 --> 00:28:16,012
while students can only date students.

366
00:28:16,012 --> 00:28:17,692
Otherwise, their relationship
won't last long, right?

367
00:28:17,692 --> 00:28:19,031
Do you have data to support your conclusion?

368
00:28:22,672 --> 00:28:24,192
Sure. Look.

369
00:28:24,192 --> 00:28:25,572
I did some case analysis.

370
00:28:25,572 --> 00:28:27,972
Uh, these are the analysis of

371
00:28:27,972 --> 00:28:29,972
the age difference and the success rate of

372
00:28:29,972 --> 00:28:31,952
long-distance relationships. Look.

373
00:28:31,952 --> 00:28:33,732
The age difference
with the highest success rate is

374
00:28:33,732 --> 00:28:36,240
between three to five years.

375
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:38,092
On the contrary, the bigger the age difference,

376
00:28:38,092 --> 00:28:40,551
the more likely
irreconcilable conflicts will arise.

377
00:28:54,472 --> 00:28:55,991
You went to all this trouble

378
00:28:55,991 --> 00:28:57,392
just to tell me that

379
00:28:57,392 --> 00:28:59,352
we're not a good match?

380
00:29:04,192 --> 00:29:05,511
Do you have other evidence?

381
00:29:10,271 --> 00:29:13,432
I-I think, for now,

382
00:29:13,991 --> 00:29:16,031
you should focus more on your studies.

383
00:29:17,672 --> 00:29:18,991
And I'm not quite clear

384
00:29:20,031 --> 00:29:21,712
about relationships,

385
00:29:22,751 --> 00:29:23,912
so I can't make a decision rashly.

386
00:29:24,472 --> 00:29:25,952
Otherwise, it would be irresponsible to you.

387
00:29:34,672 --> 00:29:36,512
But you even made a slides.

388
00:29:36,512 --> 00:29:37,616
You're quite serious.

389
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:39,991
Do you have anything else…

390
00:29:48,528 --> 00:29:49,584
What's wrong?

391
00:29:50,171 --> 00:29:51,899
Calm down. Wait for me at the office.

392
00:29:51,899 --> 00:29:53,136
I'll be right over.

393
00:29:54,472 --> 00:29:56,152
Lin Yujing needs me. Let's…

394
00:29:59,067 --> 00:30:02,031
Let's talk about our matter some other time.

395
00:30:04,848 --> 00:30:06,064
I'm leaving now.

396
00:30:25,323 --> 00:30:26,524
This way, please.

397
00:30:37,044 --> 00:30:38,323
Let me introduce myself.

398
00:30:39,404 --> 00:30:40,544
I am Huang Yuming.

399
00:30:40,544 --> 00:30:42,503
Do you have any questions about

400
00:30:42,503 --> 00:30:43,963
the lawyer's letter that I sent you?

401
00:30:43,963 --> 00:30:45,503
I can answer them.

402
00:30:45,503 --> 00:30:47,644
Shouldn't you explain to me first?

403
00:30:48,563 --> 00:30:50,023
What does this lawyer's letter mean?

404
00:30:50,023 --> 00:30:51,284
The Galaxy Bird

405
00:30:51,884 --> 00:30:53,484
is my master's work.

406
00:30:54,284 --> 00:30:56,843
How did it become your client's
intellectual property?

407
00:30:57,764 --> 00:30:59,704
Mr. Nie, don't rush.

408
00:30:59,704 --> 00:31:01,076
Let's take it step by step.

409
00:31:01,076 --> 00:31:03,044
Take a look at this.

410
00:31:10,404 --> 00:31:13,783
Mr. Nie, is this Galaxy Bird silverware

411
00:31:13,783 --> 00:31:16,083
a product of your online store?

412
00:31:16,603 --> 00:31:17,803
You already know the answer.

413
00:31:19,524 --> 00:31:22,024
On the Galaxy Bird's product details page,

414
00:31:22,024 --> 00:31:24,004
the designer is written as

415
00:31:24,004 --> 00:31:25,044
Luo Qinghe.

416
00:31:25,044 --> 00:31:26,964
That is, your uncle.

417
00:31:26,964 --> 00:31:28,124
Is that correct?

418
00:31:29,236 --> 00:31:30,404
Yes.

419
00:31:30,404 --> 00:31:31,636
Good.

420
00:31:31,636 --> 00:31:34,580
Then please look at this document.

421
00:31:40,044 --> 00:31:41,724
My client, Mr. Feng Li,

422
00:31:41,724 --> 00:31:44,756
owns the intellectual property of
this Hanhaiji series design.

423
00:31:44,756 --> 00:31:47,804
And according to the verification,

424
00:31:47,804 --> 00:31:48,984
the Galaxy Bird of Mr. Nie's online store

425
00:31:48,984 --> 00:31:50,580
is 95% similar

426
00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:52,764
to my client's design.

427
00:31:53,484 --> 00:31:55,803
So it has constituted patent infringement.

428
00:31:58,004 --> 00:32:01,504
Mr. Shen,
you're the inheritor of Qinghe Silverware.

429
00:32:01,504 --> 00:32:02,964
You also admitted that

430
00:32:02,964 --> 00:32:05,603
the design of Galaxy Bird
comes from Luo Qinghe.

431
00:32:06,563 --> 00:32:08,064
So we can confirm that

432
00:32:08,064 --> 00:32:10,164
the plagiarism also comes from

433
00:32:10,164 --> 00:32:11,843
the late designer Luo Qinghe.

434
00:32:12,803 --> 00:32:14,124
What nonsense are you talking about?

435
00:32:14,124 --> 00:32:16,664
I watched my master design
the Galaxy Bird with my own eyes.

436
00:32:16,664 --> 00:32:17,963
How could it be plagiarism?

437
00:32:18,683 --> 00:32:20,664
You must have stolen his design!

438
00:32:20,664 --> 00:32:21,883
Mr. Nie,

439
00:32:21,883 --> 00:32:23,444
only the evidence can determine

440
00:32:23,444 --> 00:32:24,763
who is the real plagiarist,

441
00:32:24,763 --> 00:32:26,304
not your memory.

442
00:32:26,304 --> 00:32:27,884
I opened the online store.

443
00:32:28,564 --> 00:32:29,763
I made those silverwares

444
00:32:29,763 --> 00:32:31,188
and sold them.

445
00:32:31,188 --> 00:32:33,384
It has nothing to do with Shen Juan.

446
00:32:33,384 --> 00:32:35,644
Let him go. I'll talk to you.

447
00:32:39,124 --> 00:32:40,596
Mr. Shen,

448
00:32:40,596 --> 00:32:42,364
design is the soul of artwork.

449
00:32:42,923 --> 00:32:44,204
And after such an incident,

450
00:32:44,204 --> 00:32:46,003
my client is very angry.

451
00:32:46,003 --> 00:32:48,084
Before I came, he instructed me that

452
00:32:48,084 --> 00:32:51,124
I must pursue this matter and find a solution.

453
00:32:55,244 --> 00:32:56,843
But during the process of

454
00:32:57,764 --> 00:33:01,224
applying for the patent for Hanhaiji,

455
00:33:01,224 --> 00:33:03,584
my uncle became a vegetable
due to a car accident.

456
00:33:03,584 --> 00:33:05,524
Until his death, he never woke up.

457
00:33:05,524 --> 00:33:06,963
Now, please tell me,

458
00:33:08,532 --> 00:33:10,284
how could my uncle plagiarize

459
00:33:19,531 --> 00:33:21,283
Mr. Feng, they…

460
00:33:21,283 --> 00:33:22,622
It's okay. You may leave now.

461
00:33:22,622 --> 00:33:23,683
I'll handle this.

462
00:33:24,683 --> 00:33:25,962
Okay.

463
00:33:26,842 --> 00:33:28,243
Come on. Sit.

464
00:33:28,243 --> 00:33:29,482
I can explain this matter.

465
00:33:32,002 --> 00:33:33,563
Before your uncle had that accident,

466
00:33:35,043 --> 00:33:36,603
I had been to Qinghe Silverware

467
00:33:36,603 --> 00:33:37,842
to visit your uncle.

468
00:33:38,496 --> 00:33:41,323
That day, I was carrying my design album,

469
00:33:42,043 --> 00:33:43,323
and I got a bit drunk.

470
00:33:43,323 --> 00:33:45,643
I know Qinghe didn't mean to steal my design.

471
00:33:48,362 --> 00:33:49,602
The deceased is gone.

472
00:33:50,443 --> 00:33:53,023
I don't want to comment on this matter anymore.

473
00:33:53,023 --> 00:33:54,347
You don't want to?

474
00:33:58,882 --> 00:34:00,283
But haven't you said enough?

475
00:34:05,842 --> 00:34:07,563
You're just distorting the fact

476
00:34:08,643 --> 00:34:10,283
because my master
can't expose your lies anymore.

477
00:34:11,403 --> 00:34:12,803
You said you visited my uncle?

478
00:34:13,387 --> 00:34:14,411
When?

479
00:34:15,002 --> 00:34:16,242
April 19th.

480
00:34:17,082 --> 00:34:19,403
That was the last time I saw him.

481
00:34:19,403 --> 00:34:20,682
You know what I want.

482
00:34:20,682 --> 00:34:22,203
It was supposed to be a win-win situation.

483
00:34:22,203 --> 00:34:25,602
But now, not only will others be involved,

484
00:34:25,602 --> 00:34:27,882
your uncle's reputation will also be affected.

485
00:34:28,762 --> 00:34:30,363
But as long as you change your mind,

486
00:34:30,363 --> 00:34:32,443
we can still talk about cooperation.

487
00:34:39,723 --> 00:34:41,082
I will not cooperate with you.

488
00:34:42,043 --> 00:34:43,523
A person as despicable as you

489
00:34:44,842 --> 00:34:46,523
will only tarnish my uncle's work.

490
00:34:47,242 --> 00:34:49,082
One should not act on impulse.

491
00:34:50,635 --> 00:34:52,683
Mr. Huang already showed you the evidence.

492
00:34:53,283 --> 00:34:54,482
I'm in control.

493
00:34:55,283 --> 00:34:57,362
With a little manipulation in public opinion,

494
00:34:58,203 --> 00:34:59,842
even without a full lawsuit,

495
00:35:00,882 --> 00:35:03,403
your uncle's reputation will be ruined.

496
00:35:09,563 --> 00:35:11,163
I will give you two more days.

497
00:35:11,835 --> 00:35:13,443
This is the last chance.

498
00:35:21,643 --> 00:35:22,971
Mr. Feng,

499
00:35:22,971 --> 00:35:25,303
I guess they won't agree so easily.

500
00:35:25,303 --> 00:35:27,043
Should I release some news

501
00:35:27,043 --> 00:35:28,283
to give them some pressure?

502
00:35:30,555 --> 00:35:31,763
Yeah. Go ahead.

503
00:35:31,763 --> 00:35:32,795
Okay.

504
00:35:47,595 --> 00:35:48,807
<i>Hello?</i>

505
00:35:48,807 --> 00:35:50,026
<i>What's wrong?</i>

506
00:35:50,026 --> 00:35:51,787
<i>It's only been a few years
and you already can't recognize me?</i>

507
00:35:59,691 --> 00:36:00,906
<i>Feng Li!</i>

508
00:36:00,906 --> 00:36:01,987
<i>Qinghe!</i>

509
00:36:01,987 --> 00:36:03,051
<i>Come in!</i>

510
00:36:12,906 --> 00:36:15,866
<i>You really haven't changed at all.</i>

511
00:36:17,547 --> 00:36:20,667
<i>Let's have a drink.</i>

512
00:36:20,667 --> 00:36:22,527
<i>Feng Li, I really can't drink,</i>

513
00:36:22,527 --> 00:36:23,547
<i>I get drunk easily.</i>

514
00:36:46,347 --> 00:36:47,627
<i>Qinghe?</i>

515
00:36:48,843 --> 00:36:49,906
<i>Qinghe?</i>

516
00:36:54,547 --> 00:36:55,747
<i>You're so bad at this.</i>

517
00:37:00,491 --> 00:37:02,467
<i>Come on. Let me help you.</i>

518
00:37:05,426 --> 00:37:07,626
<i>Here. Sit still.</i>

519
00:37:08,139 --> 00:37:09,195
<i>Don't fall.</i>

520
00:37:28,843 --> 00:37:29,963
<i>Qinghe?</i>

521
00:37:32,011 --> 00:37:33,195
<i>Qinghe?</i>

522
00:37:57,931 --> 00:37:58,987
Shen Juan,

523
00:38:00,203 --> 00:38:01,323
you'd better explain.

524
00:38:02,724 --> 00:38:05,484
What is the cooperation
Feng Li mentioned earlier?

525
00:38:08,683 --> 00:38:10,964
He plans to mass-produce
my uncle's design drafts.

526
00:38:12,084 --> 00:38:14,644
He came to me for authorization before.

527
00:38:15,796 --> 00:38:17,004
I did not agree.

528
00:38:17,724 --> 00:38:19,604
So, he came up with another plan
to threaten me.

529
00:38:20,364 --> 00:38:21,443
So,

530
00:38:22,563 --> 00:38:25,044
he got this chance because

531
00:38:25,044 --> 00:38:26,644
I sold the Galaxy Bird online.

532
00:38:31,803 --> 00:38:33,064
You don't need to worry about this.

533
00:38:33,064 --> 00:38:34,584
I will take responsibility for my actions.

534
00:38:34,584 --> 00:38:36,004
I will explain it to them.

535
00:38:36,964 --> 00:38:38,228
How?

536
00:38:39,124 --> 00:38:40,436
Can't you see?

537
00:38:40,436 --> 00:38:42,124
Feng Li is targeting me.

538
00:38:44,403 --> 00:38:46,004
I will handle the rest.

539
00:38:46,563 --> 00:38:47,803
Whether it's my uncle's reputation

540
00:38:49,012 --> 00:38:50,283
or his design,

541
00:38:51,124 --> 00:38:52,244
I will keep them intact.

542
00:38:53,236 --> 00:38:54,444
Don't interfere.

543
00:38:54,444 --> 00:38:55,508
Why?

544
00:39:00,084 --> 00:39:02,563
Why should you bear
the consequences of my actions?

545
00:39:03,443 --> 00:39:04,764
It's just like before.

546
00:39:05,604 --> 00:39:07,524
I don't even have the right
to take responsibility on my own.

547
00:39:07,524 --> 00:39:09,084
You just take over everything. Everything!

548
00:39:12,203 --> 00:39:13,244
Nie Xinghe,

549
00:39:14,964 --> 00:39:16,403
you don't understand my uncle at all.

550
00:39:18,163 --> 00:39:19,323
If my uncle were still alive

551
00:39:20,403 --> 00:39:21,803
and knew what you are like now,

552
00:39:23,244 --> 00:39:24,563
he would be very disappointed.

553
00:39:39,179 --> 00:39:40,460
<i>I noticed you've changed.</i>

554
00:39:41,139 --> 00:39:42,340
<i>You've become more cheerful.</i>

555
00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:43,800
<i>You've become more easy-going.</i>

556
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:45,300
<i>And you're no longer alone.</i>

557
00:39:46,299 --> 00:39:48,259
<i>I spotted you instantly in the crowd,</i>

558
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:50,420
<i>shining so brightly that you lit up everyone.</i>

559
00:39:51,348 --> 00:39:55,620
<i>So, I won't allow any darkness to engulf you.</i>

560
00:39:55,620 --> 00:39:57,339
<i>I won't let any bad guys harm you.</i>

561
00:39:58,460 --> 00:39:59,860
<i>I will protect you.</i>

562
00:40:13,742 --> 00:40:18,286
<i>♫ Love sprouts in my palm ♫</i>

563
00:40:19,598 --> 00:40:23,438
<i>♫ Yet worried linger within my eyes ♫</i>

564
00:40:25,230 --> 00:40:29,806
<i>♫ Our story hasn't ended ♫</i>

565
00:40:30,734 --> 00:40:34,414
<i>♫ So where are we now ♫</i>

566
00:40:36,238 --> 00:40:41,902
<i>♫ I want to hug you so badly ♫</i>

567
00:40:41,902 --> 00:40:45,966
<i>♫ I want to become better with you ♫</i>

568
00:40:47,214 --> 00:40:52,078
<i>♫ The youth we shared ♫</i>

569
00:40:52,078 --> 00:40:58,126
<i>♫ Turned into a rainbow within my heart ♫</i>

570
00:40:58,638 --> 00:41:04,206
<i>♫ I really want to warm you ♫</i>

571
00:41:04,206 --> 00:41:06,094
<i>♫ I want to share with you ♫</i>

572
00:41:06,094 --> 00:41:10,766
<i>♫ The beauty of the world ♫</i>

573
00:41:11,650 --> 00:41:13,870
<i>♫ We promised ♫</i>

574
00:41:14,446 --> 00:41:20,142
<i>♫ To never be apart ♫</i>

575
00:41:20,878 --> 00:41:26,580
<i>♫ Do you want to hear me sing ♫</i>

576
00:41:26,580 --> 00:41:31,342
<i>♫ The wind chime swaying in my heart ♫</i>

577
00:41:31,886 --> 00:41:36,110
<i>♫ Is a wish ♫</i>

578
00:41:36,846 --> 00:41:42,734
<i>♫ I secretly made for you ♫</i>

579
00:41:43,278 --> 00:41:48,814
<i>♫ I want to plant ♫</i>

580
00:41:48,814 --> 00:41:50,702
<i>♫ A red maple forest ♫</i>

581
00:41:50,702 --> 00:41:55,310
<i>♫ To dye the whole mountain red ♫</i>

582
00:41:56,238 --> 00:41:58,478
<i>♫ The sky after the rain ♫</i>

583
00:41:59,118 --> 00:42:04,046
<i>♫ Was painted by our brilliant dreams ♫</i>

584
00:42:10,926 --> 00:42:15,694
<i>♫ Time is a flower of dream ♫</i>

585
00:42:16,526 --> 00:42:21,612
<i>♫ You've already collected it ♫</i>

586
00:42:22,542 --> 00:42:26,542
<i>♫ When we all become better ♫</i>

587
00:42:28,014 --> 00:42:32,142
<i>♫ We'll see the best of the world together ♫</i>
