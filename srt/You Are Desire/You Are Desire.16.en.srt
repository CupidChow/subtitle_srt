No matter what happens,

00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:39,079
you should do it if you like it.

21
00:01:39,719 --> 00:01:41,000
You should strive for what you want.

No matter the outcome,

23
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:47,280
don't be afraid and don't hide from it.

After all, you can do anything you want, right?

25
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,960
Didn't you know
you could retrieve customer addresses

26
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,639
from the back end and print them directly?

27
00:02:39,639 --> 00:02:41,000
Mr. Fu.

28
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,120
I was almost done.

29
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,439
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

30
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,479
This is the most basic work in the law firm.

31
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:48,080
And it's common knowledge
about sending express mail.

32

You didn't finish an easy job all afternoon.

33
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,960
Just redo it.

34
00:03:21,319 --> 00:03:22,639
How was your first day at work?

35
00:03:23,719 --> 00:03:24,759
Where's Little Mushroom?

36
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,199
She went to the Student Union
and hasn't come back yet.

37
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:30,159
What did you suffer at work?

38
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:31,560
Guess what?

39
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,759
You were right.

40
00:03:32,759 --> 00:03:34,599
I was really late this morning.

41
00:03:34,599 --> 00:03:37,120
And I embarrassed myself in front of my boss.

42
00:03:38,336 --> 00:03:40,520
How could you laugh?

43
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:43,800
But I've never seen such a vindictive person.

44
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,039
I busied myself all afternoon,

45
00:03:45,039 --> 00:03:46,319
but he gave me no advice.

46
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:48,000
They blamed me
for not knowing how to check the backend.

47
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,039
If I knew everything, why would I be an intern?

48
00:03:50,039 --> 00:03:51,240
I could be the boss.

49
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:54,039
Is he trying to mess with me

50
00:03:54,039 --> 00:03:55,072
on purpose?

51
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:58,199
Your feet are blistered.
You've been running around all day?

52
00:03:58,199 --> 00:03:59,759
Not really.

53
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:02,000
I ran over in a hurry this morning.

54
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,280
And my phone ran out of battery
when I got off work.

55
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:06,360
No empty seats on the bus,
so I had to stand all the way.

56
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,960
You should already know

57
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,280
how hard life is.

58
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,800
Capitalists are the root of all evil.

59
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:16,240
How about you quit and stay in school?

60
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:20,439
No, I'm determined to do this job well.

61
00:04:20,439 --> 00:04:22,279
I will make him look at me differently.

62
00:04:22,279 --> 00:04:24,120
Okay, I believe you.

63
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,800
I'm going to take my makeup off.

64
00:04:42,079 --> 00:04:43,199
Hello, guys.

00:04:44,079 --> 00:04:47,120
Today, to review this store for you,

66
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,680
I got up early and crossed Pucheng to get here.

67
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,160
If you don't follow me now,

68
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,439
isn't that a bit too much?

69
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,399

00:04:57,319 --> 00:04:58,920

<i>How is that possible?</i>

<i>It's hard to know a person well.</i>

77
00:05:09,839 --> 00:05:12,199
What jerk? Watch your language.

78
00:05:12,199 --> 00:05:13,680

79
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,720

85
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,600
I've also been cheated

86
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,560
in a relationship.

87
00:05:52,399 --> 00:05:54,079
I hope to meet

88
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,319
and talk with you.

89
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:00,879
Please help me expose this cheater.

90
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:06,920
What? Wang Yiyang invited us to dinner?

91
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,680
And through you?

92
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,199
When did you two get acquainted?

93
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:12,896
When did you add each other on WeChat?

94
00:06:12,896 --> 00:06:14,360
We didn't.

95
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,879
Wang Yiyang wants

96
00:06:15,879 --> 00:06:17,800
to delete the post for Shen Juan.

97
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,800
So, he pretended to be heartbroken

98
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,399
and wanted to meet me.

99
00:06:21,399 --> 00:06:22,800
So, you two met?

100
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:25,399
I didn't even know it was him.

101
00:06:25,399 --> 00:06:27,800
He also didn't know that the poster was me.

102
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,120
When we met,

103
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,639
we were both taken aback.

104
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:31,800
So, did you agree to delete the post?

105
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:32,920
Absolutely not!

106
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,600
He told me

107
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,959
that Shen Juan considers you just a friend.

108
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:39,639
Seem like we were overthinking.

109
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,279
I was so angry at the time.

110
00:06:41,279 --> 00:06:43,360
I had a big argument with him.

111
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,040
But he remained unrepentant.

112
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,439
In the end, we had no choice.

113
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:49,480
We decided to gather everyone

114
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,240
and have a good talk about this.

115
00:06:54,079 --> 00:06:55,879
Do you not want to go?

116
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,160
I impulsively agreed

117
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,839
at the time.

118
00:07:00,839 --> 00:07:03,199
Should I tell him now that we're not going?

119
00:07:03,879 --> 00:07:04,879
Actually,

120
00:07:06,199 --> 00:07:07,800
it might be good to clear things up.

121
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:10,879
Okay, at that time, Gu Xia

122
00:07:10,879 --> 00:07:12,759
and I will be on your side.

123
00:07:12,759 --> 00:07:14,160
We will condemn the scumbag together

124
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,000
and expose his true face.

125
00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:34,240
I have a thought.

126
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,680
Why don't we announce our relationship?

127
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,064
Have you thought it through?

128
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:43,439
Wang Yiyang is having dinner
with Little Mushroom tonight,

129
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:45,279
saying something about deleting the post.

130
00:07:45,279 --> 00:07:46,560
I don't want things to get out of hand,

131
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:50,000
so I wrote a script.
You just need to memorize it

132
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,720
and retell it to them tonight.

133
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,759
What? What script?

134
00:07:54,439 --> 00:07:55,920
Why not just tell them directly?

135
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:58,199
No, you need to explain properly tonight.

136
00:07:58,199 --> 00:07:59,639
Right now, in their minds,

137
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:00,920
you are a scumbag.

138
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:03,000
Whether you can turn things around
depends on tonight.

139
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:25,560
Lin Yujing, don't chicken out.

140
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,639
Lin Yujing, we're all here.

141
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:29,759
We have your back. Come on.

142
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:31,120
- Let's go.
- Go.

143
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:37,824
Over here.

144
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:41,480
Go for it.

145
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:43,200
Sit.

146
00:09:00,799 --> 00:09:04,399
Shen Juan, I'm not here to accuse you.

147
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:07,279
I just want an explanation.
What's the deal with Zhu's bracelet?

148
00:09:08,039 --> 00:09:09,280
Zhu?

149
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,919
Is she the girl I know?

150
00:09:12,559 --> 00:09:13,960
Isn't she your friend?

151
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,159
What does she have to do with Juan?

152
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,960
No, hold on.

153
00:09:18,639 --> 00:09:20,600
It already happened.

154
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,360
And you're asking a friend to take the blame?

155
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:26,519
What blame? Mind your language.

156
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:28,600
Besides, what does Zhu's bracelet have to do
with Lin Yujing?

157
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:37,759
Lin Yujing, have you been into Juan?

158
00:09:40,519 --> 00:09:42,639
I really didn't notice it at all.

159
00:09:42,639 --> 00:09:44,000
When did it start?

160
00:09:45,559 --> 00:09:48,759
Can you stop flattering yourselves?

161
00:09:48,759 --> 00:09:51,320
Lin Yujing never liked him.

162
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,639
But someone flirts around with others.

163
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:00,759
Hey, you really are funny.

164
00:10:00,759 --> 00:10:02,639
In high school,
who thought of Lin Yujing as a girl?

165
00:10:03,639 --> 00:10:05,120
We had brotherhood feelings.

166
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,176
What?

167
00:10:06,176 --> 00:10:07,600
So what?

168
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,759
Unbelievable.

169
00:10:09,759 --> 00:10:11,279
Are we here to suffer

170
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:12,440
and be humiliated?

171
00:10:13,159 --> 00:10:14,879
I don't want to eat anymore. Let's go.

172
00:10:14,879 --> 00:10:16,480
What do you mean?

173
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,240
You're not happy to hear the truth?

174
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,919
You prefer lies?

175
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:22,120
What? Who said I can't I listen to the truth?

176
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,759
I don't want to eat this meal today.

177
00:10:23,759 --> 00:10:25,320
- What's wrong with you?
- Wang Yiyang, stop it.

178
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,799
What are you?

179
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,240
I've got something to say.

180
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:41,000
It was a misunderstanding.

181
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,480
He Songnan asked me to fix Zhu's bracelet.

182
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:46,039
After I fixed it, I returned it to her.

183
00:10:46,039 --> 00:10:52,399
The person I've always liked is you.

184
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:02,080
I haven't confessed to you
since the beginning of the semester.

185
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,480
And that's my mistake.

186
00:11:04,799 --> 00:11:07,080
<i>I was too eager for a good outcome.</i>

187
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,320
<i>So I couldn't</i>

188
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,759
<i>risk any possibility</i>

189
00:11:09,759 --> 00:11:11,080
<i>of losing you.</i>

190
00:11:12,879 --> 00:11:14,559
<i>What? That's not right?</i>

191
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,320
<i>It's right.</i>

192
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:19,720
<i>But if you want to hear such words,</i>

193
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:20,799
<i>you can just tell me directly.</i>

194
00:11:20,799 --> 00:11:21,799
<i>No need to beat around the bush.</i>

195
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:24,840
<i>I don't care.</i>

196
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:26,639
<i>I just want you to retell this to them tonight.</i>

197
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:29,000
<i>Just memorize it, and don't miss a word.</i>

198
00:11:36,039 --> 00:11:37,679
I was always thinking
about getting everything right,

199
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,360
ignoring your feelings in the process,

200
00:11:40,679 --> 00:11:42,600
making you feel insecure

201
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,960
and upset.

202
00:11:44,879 --> 00:11:45,879
I'm really sorry.

203
00:11:55,039 --> 00:11:57,159
Please believe my feelings for Lin Yujing.

204
00:11:58,799 --> 00:12:00,279
I've liked her since high school,

205
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:03,480
and that hasn't changed up until now.

206
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,000
There was a period of time
when I was particularly down.

207
00:12:08,799 --> 00:12:10,440
Because of her, I picked myself up

208
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:14,200
and got into Pucheng University.

209
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:35,240
So you two are together now?

210
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:39,879
Lin Yujing, why didn't you tell us?

211
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:43,759
It happened when Wenwen had a bad breakup.

212
00:12:45,159 --> 00:12:48,960
So, you've been hiding it from us

213
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,600
because you didn't want to upset Wenwen?

214
00:12:51,879 --> 00:12:53,519
I can understand you hiding it from Wenwen,

215
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:55,000
but why didn't you tell us?

216
00:12:55,879 --> 00:12:57,679
Too many things happened afterwards.

217
00:12:57,679 --> 00:12:59,159
I wanted to tell you,

218
00:12:59,159 --> 00:13:02,320
but you two grew to hate Shen Juan.

219
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,600
I didn't know how to bring it up.

220
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,799
We disliked Shen Juan

221
00:13:05,799 --> 00:13:08,080
because we thought he cheated on you.

222
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,480
We just wanted to stand up for you.

223
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:12,440
Now that he didn't do that,

224
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:14,519
I have no reason to hate him.

225
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:17,120
It's a huge misunderstanding.

226
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,200
I almost became a stumbling block

227
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,879
for your relationship.

228
00:13:19,879 --> 00:13:22,519
No, I know you meant well.

229
00:13:22,519 --> 00:13:23,840
I promise

230
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,480
if anything happens in the future,

231
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:26,639
I'll tell you two first.

232
00:13:27,919 --> 00:13:29,879
- That's more like it.
- Alright.

233
00:13:31,039 --> 00:13:32,679
Did you hear what they just said?

234
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,759
Are you sure you understand the situation?

235
00:13:36,279 --> 00:13:37,519
Alright, you can talk now.

236
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,960
I don't believe it

237
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,399
unless you two kiss.

238
00:13:43,399 --> 00:13:44,399
Or, I won't believe it.

239
00:13:45,919 --> 00:13:47,399
Yes, kiss.

240
00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:51,320
Kiss.

241
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,399
We've already kissed.

242
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,039
What?

243
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,328
When?

244
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,799
What does it have to do with you?

245
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,560
Let's drink.

246
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:09,240
Let's drink. Cheers to the two of you.

247
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:11,159
Come on, cheers.

248
00:14:11,159 --> 00:14:12,960
Congratulations.

249
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,208
Well played. Let's drink.

250
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:53,799
<i>Little Mushroom wrote a post about tonight.</i>

251
00:14:55,639 --> 00:14:57,759
I explained everything to Wenwen.

252
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,639
<i>She's not mad.</i>

253
00:14:59,639 --> 00:15:02,200
She asked Little Mushroom to post it quickly.
She wants to know the follow-up.

254
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:05,799
So, can we go out for dinner tomorrow

255
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:09,159
and start our first official date?

256
00:15:09,159 --> 00:15:10,799
Of course.

257
00:15:10,799 --> 00:15:13,120
My last class tomorrow is shooting.

258
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:14,720
<i>You can come pick me up.</i>

259
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,200
Okay.

260
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,799
I'm going back to the dorm.

261
00:15:17,799 --> 00:15:18,840
<i>Goodnight.</i>

262
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,000
Bye.

263
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:27,080
<i>Congratulations on you
and Shen Juan getting together.</i>

264
00:15:33,639 --> 00:15:35,399
<i>You're well-informed.</i>

265
00:15:35,399 --> 00:15:37,399
<i>Let me guess who told you</i>

266
00:15:37,399 --> 00:15:38,559
<i>so quickly.</i>

267
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,759
<i>Is it you, Senior He?</i>

268
00:15:44,279 --> 00:15:46,120
<i>Since when did you two get so close?</i>

269
00:15:58,799 --> 00:16:01,919
<i>Senior He, my lecture just ended.</i>

270
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:03,000
<i>I'll come over right now.</i>

271
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,399
Ruyi.

272
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:06,799
Senior He.

273
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,080
Why are you here?

274
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:10,399
I came to pick you up.

275
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:12,799
Today you are my teacher.

276
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:13,919
I should take good care of you.

277
00:16:15,712 --> 00:16:17,039
Let's go.

278
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:24,360
This is the test paper you did a few days ago.

279
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:26,639
You're so thoughtful.

280
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:27,679
You printed it out for me.

281
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,592
I think your main problem now

282
00:16:30,592 --> 00:16:31,919
is grammar.

283
00:16:31,919 --> 00:16:33,120
So I brought my high school

284
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,559
and college grammar notes

285
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:36,384
for you.

286
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:42,320
If only I could meet you earlier.

287
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,679
Maybe I could have scored higher
on the college entrance exam.

288
00:16:46,039 --> 00:16:47,759
I just work harder

289
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:49,720
and practice more.

290
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:51,720
Senior He, you have a good foundation.

291
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:53,200
If you…

292
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,879
Why don't you just call me by my name?

293
00:16:54,879 --> 00:16:57,679
You sound distant to call me Senior He.

294
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,200
If you insist on that,

295
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:05,079
I'll call you Master.

296
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:07,240
Master.

297
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:11,400
Okay, I'll call you

298
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,680
He Songnan.

299
00:17:13,279 --> 00:17:14,496
Alright.

300
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:17,599
We were talking about grammar.

301
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:19,720
You need to improve your grammar

302
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:22,640
and increase your vocabulary.

303
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:25,039
In that way, you can pass the English test.

304
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:31,839
I have a bad memory.

305
00:17:31,839 --> 00:17:33,119
I just can't remember vocabulary.

306
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:35,440
I still can't tell the difference

307
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:38,640
between potatoes and tomatoes.

308
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,096
Right.

309
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:45,279
Let me tell you a story.

310
00:17:45,279 --> 00:17:46,319
Okay.

311
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:51,640
When I was a child,
we grew small tomatoes that were very sweet

312
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:52,960
and easy to survive.

313
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,559
We ate them like fruits.
They were very delicious.

314
00:17:56,519 --> 00:17:59,359
Later, my parents went out to work,

315
00:17:59,359 --> 00:18:01,240
and that piece of land was rented out.

316
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:03,079
I also went to the city for school,

317
00:18:03,079 --> 00:18:05,640
so I never ate that kind of tomato again.

318
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:10,640
The word Tomato starts with letter T.

319
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:13,440
It means sweet.

320
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:16,200
I still miss that taste very much.

321
00:18:19,279 --> 00:18:20,359
Tomato.

322
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:23,240
Tomato is sweet.

323
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:28,759
- I remembered.
- Okay, go on.

324
00:18:28,759 --> 00:18:30,160
Thank you

325
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,880
for sharing this story with me.

326
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,000
Continue with the paper.

327
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,079
- Okay.
- This one.

328
00:18:39,079 --> 00:18:43,319
What is happening
in workforce in rich countries?

329
00:18:43,319 --> 00:18:45,480
It has two key words.

330
00:18:59,895 --> 00:19:04,418
<i>[Tomato experimental plot owned by He Songnan.
No trespassing.]</i>

331
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,319
You came again.

332
00:19:08,319 --> 00:19:10,640
I warn you.

333
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,680
I could tolerate you messing
with my stuff before.

334
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:14,160
But you can't ruin these plants.

335
00:19:15,359 --> 00:19:16,400
Got it?

336
00:19:18,592 --> 00:19:19,920
Come on.

337
00:19:28,557 --> 00:19:33,864
<i>[Tomato experimental plot owned by He Songnan.
No trespassing.]</i>

338
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,464
Yujing.

339
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:46,079
<i>Why haven't you visited home
since you were back in Pucheng?</i>

340
00:19:46,839 --> 00:19:48,000
I've been too busy since school started.

341
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,160
Anyway, you can come home for a meal.

342
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,480
Tomorrow is the weekend.

343
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:55,240
We will cook your favorite dishes.

344
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,240
<i>Come home for dinner tonight.</i>

345
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,519
I'm busy tomorrow.

346
00:19:59,519 --> 00:20:00,839
Don't make excuses with me.

347
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:02,640
If you don't come back,

348
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:03,880
<i>I'll find you at school.</i>

349
00:20:04,759 --> 00:20:06,656
I got it.

350
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:21,160
<i>Are you there? I'll pick you up after dinner.</i>

351
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,680
<i>I'll tell you after dinner.</i>

352
00:20:28,359 --> 00:20:31,079
Lin Yujing, stop playing on your phone.

353
00:20:31,079 --> 00:20:32,240
Dinner is ready.

354
00:20:34,599 --> 00:20:35,759
Let me introduce you.

355
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,359
This is my daughter Lin Yujing.

356
00:20:39,079 --> 00:20:40,839
This is Mr. Wang from the publishing house.

357
00:20:40,839 --> 00:20:42,240
Say hello.

358
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,839
- Hello, Mr. Wang.
- Hello.

359
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,799
I heard of you from your father.

360
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:49,119
You were admitted
to Pucheng University this year.

361
00:20:49,119 --> 00:20:50,119
What's your major?

362
00:20:50,119 --> 00:20:51,920
Finance.

363
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:54,839
It's a top-notch major at Pucheng University.

364
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:57,759
Meng, your daughter
is both intelligent and pretty.

365
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:01,160
With her scores,

366
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,680
she could be admitted

367
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:03,799
to other top universities.

368
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:07,079
Your daughter is so outstanding.

369
00:21:07,079 --> 00:21:09,279
Could she meet my son?

370
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,079
Who knows what will happen?

371
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:15,160
My son is graduated from a famous university.

372
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:17,119
We have such a good relationship.

373
00:21:17,119 --> 00:21:18,519
You have nothing to worry about.

374
00:21:20,759 --> 00:21:24,200
How about they add each other on WeChat?

375
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,200
Leave the rest to them.

376
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:29,960
Dad, I have a boyfriend.

377
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:34,839
When did you start dating?

378
00:21:35,559 --> 00:21:36,559
Why didn't you tell me?

379
00:21:37,792 --> 00:21:38,920
I'm asking you.

380
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,400
It's okay.

381
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,720
Just a friend on WeChat.

382
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:42,920
It's good to make friends.

383
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:47,559
Wang, this wine is of a good vintage.

384
00:21:47,559 --> 00:21:48,599
Would you like to try it?

385
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:50,279
Sure, cheers.

386
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:52,519
Thank you, Old Wang.

387
00:21:52,519 --> 00:21:53,664
Drink more.

388
00:22:11,119 --> 00:22:13,799
I forgot to send you a message.
Have you been waiting long?

389
00:22:13,799 --> 00:22:15,279
Fine, I just got here.

390
00:22:15,279 --> 00:22:16,720
Going back to school? I can accompany you.

391
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:17,799
Let's go.

392
00:22:42,759 --> 00:22:44,079
Yujing.

393
00:22:44,079 --> 00:22:45,839
Why didn't you speak in the WeChat group?

394
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:49,400
Mr. Wang is an elder after all.
Don't be impolite.

395
00:22:50,119 --> 00:22:51,319
<i>Also, next week,</i>

396
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:54,640
<i>he's bringing his son to our home.
You should be there.</i>

397
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:57,240
Dad, enough of this. I won't be going.

398
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,839
I'm not asking you to date with him.

399
00:23:01,359 --> 00:23:03,279
Mr. Wang's family is well-off,

400
00:23:03,279 --> 00:23:04,720
and his son is a good guy.

401
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,480
<i>You two just make friends.</i>

402
00:23:08,319 --> 00:23:09,920
Dad, do you think

403
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:11,440
everyone has to be like you,

404
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:12,960
living a life relying on others?

405
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:14,759
Can't you be respectful?

406
00:23:22,359 --> 00:23:23,599
<i>Hello, Mr. Meng.</i>

407
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,440
Who are you?

408
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,720
I'm--

409
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:30,599
<i>Yujing, who is he?</i>

410
00:23:30,599 --> 00:23:31,839
<i>I'm telling you.</i>

411
00:23:31,839 --> 00:23:33,119
Be wary of boys

412
00:23:33,119 --> 00:23:34,440
out there.

413
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:39,000
<i>And don't care about appearances, understand?</i>

414
00:23:42,759 --> 00:23:45,480
My girlfriend had a meal at home.

415
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:46,599
She's dumping me after that.

416
00:23:50,039 --> 00:23:51,616
Are you jealous?

417
00:23:56,839 --> 00:23:59,119
How come I have a jealous boyfriend?

418
00:24:00,359 --> 00:24:01,640
Who told you I'm jealous?

419
00:24:24,759 --> 00:24:26,960
I had an interesting class today.

420
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,160
Really?

421
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,599
Well--

422
00:24:29,599 --> 00:24:31,440
Shen Juan.

423
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,440
Shen Juan, I've been waiting for you.

424
00:24:34,079 --> 00:24:36,680
I want to invite you to a meal.

425
00:24:38,359 --> 00:24:40,359
The food at the second cafeteria is delicious.

426
00:24:40,359 --> 00:24:42,640
Let's try it together.

427
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,319
No, thanks.

428
00:24:44,319 --> 00:24:46,200
Shen Juan, I swear.

429
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:47,839
I won't say anything else today,

430
00:24:47,839 --> 00:24:49,952
nor will I persuade you
to join the sports meet in March.

431
00:24:49,952 --> 00:24:51,720
I just want to buy you a meal.

432
00:24:58,359 --> 00:25:01,400
Rong Huai, let me tell you one last time.

433
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,480
Stop looking for me.

434
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:04,519
I can't go back to the past.

435
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:12,032
Let's go.

436
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:24,064
Thank you.

437
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,720
What did you ask me out for?

438
00:25:28,119 --> 00:25:30,400
About Shen Juan.

439
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,279
If you want me to persuade Shen Juan

440
00:25:32,279 --> 00:25:33,839
to continue practicing shooting,

441
00:25:33,839 --> 00:25:35,240
I can't help at all.

442
00:25:35,759 --> 00:25:37,160
You've seen his attitude.

443
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:40,160
His decisions won't be influenced by others.

444
00:25:41,559 --> 00:25:42,720
But he can be influenced by you.

445
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:47,160
During this time, I've been pestering him.

446
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:49,359
Given his past character,
he would have taught me a lesson.

447
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,960
He wouldn't have the patience to listen to me.

448
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:57,000
He started practicing
rapid-fire shooting at 12.

449
00:25:57,759 --> 00:26:00,160
At 13, he joined the city team.

450
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:02,279
At 15, he was promoted to the provincial team.

451
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:05,799
And at 16, he represented the provincial team
in the national championship.

452
00:26:06,319 --> 00:26:07,359
He's very talented.

453
00:26:09,839 --> 00:26:12,839
At that time, he was already selected
for the national youth Olympic team.

454
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:15,160
But he gave it up.

455
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:17,720
The national youth Olympic team?

456
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,640
Everyone had high hopes for him back then.

457
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:25,079
They thought he could win glory
for the country in the Olympic races.

458
00:26:26,519 --> 00:26:29,160
At 16, he joined
the national youth Olympic team.

459
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:31,799
It can't be achieved just based on talent.

460
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:36,640
It's hard to imagine how hard he worked

461
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:37,880
on shooting.

462
00:26:41,599 --> 00:26:43,119
No one loved shooting more than him.

463
00:26:45,319 --> 00:26:47,000
So why did he give up?

464
00:26:48,599 --> 00:26:49,792
I don't know.

465
00:26:51,599 --> 00:26:53,759
I just heard it was because of his family.

466
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,480
If he's willing to return to the team now,

467
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:02,240
he would definitely create glory again

468
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:04,039
at the national championship next March.

469
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:07,839
So please help me persuade him.

470
00:27:12,359 --> 00:27:14,519
Let me think about it.
I'll let you know when I've decided.

471
00:27:15,359 --> 00:27:16,864
Thank you in advance.

472
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,359
Tomorrow is the weekend.

473
00:27:38,359 --> 00:27:39,599
Have you thought about where you want to go?

474
00:27:41,559 --> 00:27:43,400
I haven't. I'll listen to you.

475
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:46,960
How about coming to my home?

476
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:53,079
What? Are you scared?

477
00:27:54,759 --> 00:27:56,160
What's there to be scared of?

478
00:27:57,759 --> 00:27:58,960
Don't overthink it.

479
00:27:59,599 --> 00:28:02,400
I just want to show you my house.

480
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:06,240
I'm not overthinking, but you are.

481
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:10,960
Okay, I'll call Wang Yiyang
and He Songnan over.

482
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:11,960
Let's all eat hot pot together.

483
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:13,240
Sounds good.

484
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:15,000
Alright, you have an early rest.

485
00:28:15,759 --> 00:28:17,024
Goodbye.

486
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,480
Why are you bringing stuff here?

487
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,720
It's my first time here,
so I brought some food and drinks.

488
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:32,759
Your favorite peach flavor.

489
00:28:36,039 --> 00:28:37,480
Give it to me.

490
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:38,640
Is this Orange?

491
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:41,759
Orange.

492
00:28:45,839 --> 00:28:47,000
Do you still remember me?

493
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:52,119
Guess what? Orange got really wild now,

494
00:28:52,119 --> 00:28:53,519
He already become the king of the cats here.

495
00:28:53,519 --> 00:28:55,040
You're awesome.

496
00:28:56,519 --> 00:28:57,519
He just got fatter.

497
00:28:57,519 --> 00:28:58,720
Isn't that because you feed him well?

498
00:28:59,799 --> 00:29:00,920
You go play.

499
00:29:09,359 --> 00:29:10,400
You're still keeping it.

500
00:29:15,359 --> 00:29:17,400
What about the teddy bear I swapped with you?

501
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:20,880
I threw it away.

502
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,472
Really?

503
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:34,759
They've arrived.
I'll go help them with their stuff.

504
00:29:56,079 --> 00:29:57,536
Orange.

505
00:30:03,759 --> 00:30:04,799
Orange.

506
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,640
I'm here, Juan.

507
00:30:58,519 --> 00:31:00,559
He, do you know

508
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:02,519
why Shen Juan gave up on rapid fire?

509
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:09,680
Maybe you should ask him about this yourself.

510
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:11,880
Does it have to do with his uncle?

511
00:31:13,359 --> 00:31:15,136
Come on.

512
00:31:15,136 --> 00:31:16,640
I bought so much stuff.

513
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:17,799
You all will be stuffed.

514
00:31:17,799 --> 00:31:20,160
I know you're starving. You cook.

515
00:31:22,839 --> 00:31:25,240
I really miss the days
when we ate hot pot in the store.

516
00:31:26,119 --> 00:31:27,520
Do you, Lin Yujing?

517
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,440
- Come on. Let's cook.
- No.

518
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:31,960
I don't want to.

519
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:34,200
- Do you need help?
- No.

520
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:35,440
Just wait for dinner.

521
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:44,839
Come on, hot pot's ready.

522
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:48,480
The four of us eat hot pot together again.

523
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,519
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

524
00:31:50,519 --> 00:31:51,519
Cheers.

525
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:52,736
Wait a moment.

526
00:32:00,768 --> 00:32:01,960
Come on. Let's have a toast.

527
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:02,960
Cheers.

528
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:04,192
Cheers.

529
00:32:09,559 --> 00:32:11,559
Juan has changed
since he started dating, hasn't he?

530
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:16,799
Not just Juan.

531
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:18,039
I've changed too.

532
00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:21,480
I thought farming was easy,
so I chose agriculture.

533
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:23,200
I never expected it to be this hard.

534
00:32:23,759 --> 00:32:25,079
Aren't you researching

535
00:32:25,079 --> 00:32:26,799
high-tech agricultural products?

536
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:28,400
Don't even mention it.
I couldn't grow any vegetables

537
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:29,440
but spent a month catching bugs.

538
00:32:30,279 --> 00:32:31,680
Catching bugs?

539
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:33,680
You know what?

540
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:35,480
The worm is plump and furry.

541
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:37,599
We must catch it with our hands

542
00:32:37,599 --> 00:32:38,880
and observe and identify it.

543
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,279
We need to write reports.

544
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:42,000
After a month,

545
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,240
my eyes are now scanners
for agricultural pests.

546
00:32:46,759 --> 00:32:48,920
It sounds quite interesting.

547
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:51,000
He, can you take me around

548
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,880
another day?

549
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:54,880
I can collect some material.

550
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:56,920
What are you up to? For your short videos?

551
00:32:58,079 --> 00:33:01,319
My fans encourage me to update
and climb the rankings every day.

552
00:33:01,319 --> 00:33:02,359
I decided

553
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,720
to keep doing this well.

554
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:06,039
For your career,

555
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:07,839
I decided to support you.

556
00:33:07,839 --> 00:33:08,992
Come on.

557
00:33:12,519 --> 00:33:15,240
Lin Yujing, what do you plan
to do after graduation?

558
00:33:16,279 --> 00:33:19,279
Well, I haven't figured it out yet.

559
00:33:20,319 --> 00:33:21,440
Whatever Lin Yujing does,

560
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:22,799
shouldn't it depend on Juan's future plans?

561
00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:24,640
Isn't that right?

562
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:30,000
Enough, stop talking.

563
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,279
- Eat meat. Come on.
- Hold on.

564
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:36,559
Are you going to eat it all?

565
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,599
There's so much in her bowl. Stop it.

566
00:33:42,319 --> 00:33:43,720
Let's eat.

567
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:46,960
Seeing Juan in love, I also want to be in love.

568
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,359
Could you be like Juan?

569
00:33:49,359 --> 00:33:50,519
No, I can't,

570
00:33:50,519 --> 00:33:52,440
but I could be like Lin Yujing,
waiting to be fed.

571
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:53,920
You're disgusting, Wang Yiyang.

572
00:34:04,519 --> 00:34:06,920
Why didn't you let me drink beer?

573
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:08,760
I feel like I was despised by Wang Yiyang.

574
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:11,639
Have you forgotten what you're like
when you're drunk?

575
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:14,960
If I drink juice next time,

576
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,000
you will do the same.

577
00:34:16,864 --> 00:34:17,920
Okay.

578
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:20,608
I'm going back.

579
00:34:20,608 --> 00:34:21,719
See you.

580
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:29,152
Love you.

581
00:34:32,128 --> 00:34:33,239
What about you?

582
00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:34,239
Me?

583
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:35,239
Show it to me.

584
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:40,760
Do you feel embarrassed?

585
00:35:20,921 --> 00:35:25,856
<i>[Shen Juan's Shooting Information]</i>

586
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,599
<i>Shen Juan, you have talent</i>

587
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:44,719
<i>and opportunities. You have the ability
to stand at the pinnacle of the competition.</i>

588
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:47,440
<i>How could you give up halfway?</i>

589
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:37,039
<i>I've decided to give it a try.</i>

590
00:36:37,039 --> 00:36:39,440
<i>Shen Juan's future
should be considered seriously.</i>

591
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:58,119
<i>Juan, do you want</i>

592
00:36:58,639 --> 00:36:59,880
<i>to take over my store?</i>

593
00:37:23,559 --> 00:37:26,039
<i>I have something important to say.
Where are you?</i>

594
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:36,960
<i>Are you in the dorm?</i>

595
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,920
I am.

596
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:40,704
<i>You look down at the window.</i>

597
00:37:48,039 --> 00:37:49,840
<i>I'll take you somewhere.</i>

598
00:38:28,039 --> 00:38:29,199
Why did you bring me here?

599
00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:32,719
I just wanted to have a look.

600
00:38:35,039 --> 00:38:36,280
Without this shop,

601
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,400
I wouldn't have come to fix my bracelet.

602
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:39,440
And I wouldn't have met you.

603
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:45,440
There are indeed a lot of memories here.

604
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:48,400
If it weren't for the college entrance exam,

605
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:49,639
I wouldn't want to close it.

606
00:38:53,079 --> 00:38:55,199
Actually, many regrets

607
00:38:55,199 --> 00:38:57,599
can be made up. Have you thought--

608
00:38:57,599 --> 00:38:58,719
I decided to start over.

609
00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:03,119
I'll reopen this store.

610
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:06,880
How is it so sudden?

611
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:09,159
It's not that sudden.

612
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:11,000
I've thought about it before.

613
00:39:11,559 --> 00:39:12,639
After going to college,

614
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:14,840
I'll reopen it.

615
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,519
I still can't bear to leave this place.

616
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:39,159
I'll move back to the store in a few days.

617
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:41,920
What's your hurry?

618
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,400
Nothing.

619
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:46,920
I planned to reopen the store

620
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:48,000
after settling down.

621
00:39:50,639 --> 00:39:52,519
It's not a small matter.

622
00:39:52,519 --> 00:39:53,679
Right.

623
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,000
I'll send them a message.

624
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:10,320
We need to be fully prepared
and make a big move.

625
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:11,880
I'll be in charge of promotion.

626
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:14,400
I can use social media

627
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:15,800
to attract customers.

628
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:17,719
Can you do it without many followers?

629
00:40:18,719 --> 00:40:20,519
Are you looking down on me?

630
00:40:20,519 --> 00:40:21,920
I got quite popular this month.

631
00:40:22,719 --> 00:40:24,039
Let's put the promotion aside for now.

632
00:40:24,039 --> 00:40:25,360
Let's discuss the opening first.

633
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:28,360
How do you plan for the opening?

634
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:32,119
Today, let's take stock of everything

635
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:33,960
of the store.

636
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,920
We need to know
if the equipment is still usable.

637
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:40,000
We need to take inventory,
so we can replenish what's missing.

638
00:40:40,544 --> 00:40:41,719
Okay.

639
00:40:41,719 --> 00:40:42,960
You guys go to the storage room first,

640
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:43,960
and I'll go get some boxes.

641
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:45,119
Okay.

642
00:40:51,719 --> 00:40:53,880
Why is it so messy?

643
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:55,039
How could he have the mood

644
00:40:55,039 --> 00:40:56,360
to tidy up in his hardest time?

645
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:59,039
Don't make a fuss in front of Juan.

646
00:40:59,679 --> 00:41:02,000
Don't worry. I know what to do.

647
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:08,288
Let's begin.

648
00:41:17,559 --> 00:41:19,000
We found the cash register and scanner?

649
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,559
Good, we can power them up
to see if they still work.

650
00:41:21,559 --> 00:41:22,688
Okay.

651
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:40,880
This box is full of things
I've never seen before.

652
00:41:42,599 --> 00:41:45,360
They were collected
when Uncle Qinghe passed away.

653
00:41:46,119 --> 00:41:47,119
They're all empty boxes.

654
00:41:48,239 --> 00:41:50,440
I'll clean them up and put them in the shop.

655
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:51,616
Okay.

656
00:41:53,519 --> 00:41:55,880
Juan, I need help.

657
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:57,079
Coming.

658
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:16,960
<i>Dreams once made my life colorful</i>

659
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:19,079
<i>and left me stuck in the depths of despair.</i>

660
00:42:19,719 --> 00:42:22,719
<i>However, you came to me,</i>

661
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:27,159
<i>and told me I shone in your eyes.</i>

662
00:42:28,039 --> 00:42:29,119
<i>Because of you,</i>

663
00:42:29,719 --> 00:42:31,199
<i>even if I'm not sure,</i>

664
00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:33,480
<i>I'm willing to give it a try.</i>
