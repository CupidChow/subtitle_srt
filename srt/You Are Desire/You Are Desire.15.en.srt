Wait. Hold on.

20
00:01:38,359 --> 00:01:39,439
Keep our relationship a secret?

21
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:43,920
Do you mean that we can't hold hands and…

22
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,000
Of course not. We just can't do that at school.

23
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:48,719
But we can do whatever we want in private.

24
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:54,840
If you keep being silent,
I'll take it as a yes.

25
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:57,159
But there has to be a time limit, right?

26
00:01:57,159 --> 00:01:58,599
We can't always be like this.

27
00:01:58,599 --> 00:02:01,280
We won't. She just broke up.

28
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,799
She'll be fine after a period.

29
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:04,079
By then, we'll tell her about us.

Why don't you have any classes on Wednesday?

33
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:36,759
Do you want to take a day off?

34
00:02:36,759 --> 00:02:38,199
Well, I wish.

35
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:40,680
My dad asked me to intern at a law firm.

36
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:43,319
He said,
"Theory needs to be combined with practice."

37
00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:45,800
I need to take a day off every week to work.

38
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,199
Geez, we're only freshmen.
Do you have to push yourself so hard?

39
00:02:50,199 --> 00:02:52,960
I didn't want to go either,
but my dad insisted,

40
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:56,080
so I had to agree. At least I can make
some extra money. What about you?

41
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,120
Have you chosen your classes?

42
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,360
Not yet. There's still plenty of time.

43
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,680
I need to focus on my important task first.

00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,719
Of course.

47
00:03:10,719 --> 00:03:13,080
Before Wenwen went home,
I already got her permission.

48
00:03:13,719 --> 00:03:16,280
I want to expose
these scumbags' tricks on the internet.

49
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:19,280
When the other girls read my post,
they'll know better and avoid being hurt.

50
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:22,080
Isn't this a bit too much?
What if it causes a big fuss?

51
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:25,439
Don't worry. I only use fake names.

52
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:28,120
Later, I'll ask Lin Yujing for some advice.

53
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,520
I'll also add
some stuff about Shen Juan to my post.

54
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:32,719
And then, no one will know who I refer to.

55
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:36,199
Why hasn't Lin Yujing come back yet?

56
00:03:36,919 --> 00:03:38,360
She's rarely in the dormitory these days.

57
00:03:41,319 --> 00:03:42,400
I'm out of inspiration.

00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:46,080

It's my first time
doing something serious in an Internet cafe.

60
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,879
But now I even feel guilty somehow.

61
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:52,520
Well, our university library is much better.

62
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,960
Shall we go back?

63
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:57,280
Nope. Our relationship is still a secret.

Why so fast?
Are you picking your classes randomly?

66
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,159
No. I know what I've chosen.

67
00:04:12,439 --> 00:04:14,000
What about the public class?

68
00:04:14,592 --> 00:04:15,840
Anything. It's up to you.

69
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:22,279
Up to me? Then I'll pick flower arrangement,
tea art, and jewelry appreciation.

70
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:30,199
Seriously? Aren't you going to think twice?

71
00:04:30,199 --> 00:04:33,040

Didn't you learn to shoot before?

00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,240

Basketball suits you too.

79
00:05:04,879 --> 00:05:07,720
The smell here is too choking.
Shall we go back?

80
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:13,879

81
00:06:13,879 --> 00:06:16,000

00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,319
The owner is a great cook.

83
00:06:17,319 --> 00:06:19,680
The skewers he makes taste amazing.

84
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,279
Look! It just…

85
00:06:28,079 --> 00:06:30,439
What's wrong? No viewers again?

86
00:06:30,439 --> 00:06:31,560
Can you not laugh at me?

87
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:34,360
Nobody came when I was live-streaming just now.

88
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:37,120
You didn't help me and even laughed at me.

89
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,040
When did you become so fragile?

90
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:41,040
I'm not fragile. It's just…

91
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,360
I'm just too miserable.

92
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:46,480
I remember you didn't pass the CET-4, did you?

93
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,839
I'll try again. I'm just a sophomore.

94
00:06:48,839 --> 00:06:50,199
All right. Don't make yourself look so pitiful.

95
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,560
I can't help you with English,

96
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,319
but I can help you with your account
and see what I can do.

97
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,199
This short video has a decent number of views.

98
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,079
That one? That's because Juan suddenly appeared

99
00:07:08,079 --> 00:07:09,639
when I recorded this video.

100
00:07:15,439 --> 00:07:16,600
It's late. Why are you here?

101
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:20,240
He insisted that late-night snack hunting
could attract more viewers.

102
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,079
But there was nobody at all.

103
00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:25,120
The food here is good. Want to have a try?

104
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:27,680
I'll have a beer.

105
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,120
I'll get it for you. Hold on.

106
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:33,399
Have some barbecue.

107
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,079
Come on. Let's drink.

108
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,720
Eat up! Eat up!

109
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:52,959
Juan, eat up.

110
00:07:53,839 --> 00:07:56,439
Here. It's yours.

111
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:01,839
What's wrong? Something on your mind?

112
00:08:05,399 --> 00:08:06,600
I got scratched by a cat.

113
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:10,839
Cat? You mean Orange?
Isn't it usually well-behaved?

114
00:08:10,839 --> 00:08:11,920
Why did it scratch you?

115
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:14,959
Pets are like people.

116
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:17,439
Once they know they're special,
they become arrogant.

117
00:08:18,199 --> 00:08:19,680
But you can only spoil it.

118
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,560
After all, that's your cat.
What else can you do?

119
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:27,319
You're right. I still have to spoil her.

120
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,720
Come on. Let's drink!

121
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:58,559
Senior He, what's the matter?

122
00:08:58,559 --> 00:09:01,960
Hello, I-I want to ask you for a favor.

123
00:09:02,919 --> 00:09:06,200
<i>I didn't pass the CET-4 in June.</i>

124
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,360
My teacher said if I can't pass in December,

125
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:10,159
I won't be able to participate in
the practical class during the winter vacation.

126
00:09:11,039 --> 00:09:12,159
So strict!

127
00:09:12,799 --> 00:09:13,960
<i>Isn't it?</i>

128
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:16,600
I never thought that I would still
be ruled by English in university.

129
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:19,840
But I heard that you did very well
on your college entrance English exam.

130
00:09:20,919 --> 00:09:22,519
<i>So, I'm thinking,</i>

131
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:25,759
could you please help me with my English?

132
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,279
I can, but…

133
00:09:30,279 --> 00:09:33,080
<i>I haven't passed the CET-4 either.</i>

134
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,200
I need to get prepared.

135
00:09:36,639 --> 00:09:39,639
How about this?
I'll go to the university town in a few days.

136
00:09:39,639 --> 00:09:40,919
I'll visit you by then.

137
00:09:40,919 --> 00:09:43,000
Okay. Great! I'll be waiting.

138
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,679
<i>Okay.</i>

139
00:09:44,679 --> 00:09:45,984
Okay, bye!

140
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,679
<i>This is one of the old exams.</i>

141
00:09:55,679 --> 00:09:58,159
<i>You should go through it,
and I'll get to know your level.</i>

142
00:09:58,159 --> 00:10:00,559
<i>It'll be easier for me to know
which part I should focus on.</i>

143
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,879
<i>Juan, how did you get gossiped about?</i>

144
00:10:29,559 --> 00:10:30,639
What gossip?

145
00:10:31,159 --> 00:10:33,679
<i>I mean the gossip post on our school forum.</i>

146
00:10:33,679 --> 00:10:35,840
<i>Someone posted about you just now.</i>

147
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:38,000
<i>The poster is spreading rumors that
you've dumped your girlfriend.</i>

148
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,200
<i>Your first love is mentioned,
but it seems to refer to Lin Yujing.</i>

149
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,240
<i>This is pure nonsense, Juan.</i>

150
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:01,320
<i>It seems that
we can't keep our relationship a secret.</i>

151
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,240
<i>It gives rumors a chance to spread.</i>

152
00:11:16,799 --> 00:11:19,080
<i>Since it's a rumor, it doesn't matter.</i>

153
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,840
<i>Let's keep the truth between us.</i>

154
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,384
Oh, dear. How should we tell her?

155
00:11:28,384 --> 00:11:29,856
No idea.

156
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:34,320
You're back! Hurry up and get dressed.

157
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,279
Tonight the guitar club is having
a welcome party at the beach.

158
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:38,360
Let's go together.

159
00:11:39,039 --> 00:11:40,639
Welcome party?

160
00:11:40,639 --> 00:11:42,879
Didn't you say that
getting close to men will bring misfortune?

161
00:11:42,879 --> 00:11:45,639
I also said yesterday that
the best way to forget a jerk

162
00:11:45,639 --> 00:11:47,240
is to meet your Mr. Right.

163
00:11:49,159 --> 00:11:52,799
I'm a bit tired. I just want to have some rest.
You guys have fun.

164
00:11:52,799 --> 00:11:54,080
Wait.

165
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:59,399
Lin Yujing, you must watch this video.

166
00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:00,640
Yes, you must watch it.

167
00:12:15,399 --> 00:12:20,159
Well, the camerawork is quite poor.

168
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:24,639
Lin Yujing, wake up! Is that the point?

169
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:26,039
Did you see those bullet comments?

170
00:12:26,039 --> 00:12:28,200
He is showing off like a peacock!

171
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:30,799
Lin Yujing, since that's the case,

172
00:12:30,799 --> 00:12:32,279
you must prove that you're better than him.

173
00:12:32,279 --> 00:12:34,080
If you lose to him, I will be angry.

174
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:35,759
Yujing,

175
00:12:36,279 --> 00:12:39,639
will you keep me company? Please?

176
00:12:39,639 --> 00:12:40,879
Please?

177
00:12:42,759 --> 00:12:44,000
- Okay.
- Good! We'll go!

178
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,159
I'll use all my make-up techniques on you.

179
00:12:46,159 --> 00:12:48,519
I'll give you the most beautiful makeup
and make you the star of tonight!

180
00:12:48,519 --> 00:12:49,720
After I finish, we will post her on Moments.

181
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:50,720
Yes! Post her on Moments!

182
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:51,808
Come on!

183
00:12:51,808 --> 00:12:53,240
T-That's not necessary. Really.

184
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:55,559
It's a bit too much. I'm already pretty.

185
00:12:55,559 --> 00:12:57,200
- Use this one.
- We can't make her seem too cheesy.

186
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,840
- We need to use this one.
- Oh, that looks good.

187
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,559
This place is so beautiful.

188
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,639

Lin Yujing, since you're here,

192
00:13:16,519 --> 00:13:17,840
you have to at least pretend to be happy.

193
00:13:18,799 --> 00:13:22,080

Well, well. I'm surprised.

287
00:19:52,119 --> 00:19:53,640
I never knew that our university library

288
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:55,000

289
00:20:00,512 --> 00:20:01,799

290
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:09,599
The description is a bit exaggerated,
but the video is not bad.

291
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:12,200
Not bad, indeed. Look at you.

292
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,640
You're dressed so beautifully.

293
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:18,279
You never put this much effort
when meeting your boyfriend.

294
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:22,960
Well, you're not bad, either.

295
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:25,480
You also looked good in this video.

296
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,720
If I hadn't come with them,

297
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:36,359

posted this video on the forum.

I can't wait any longer.

299

300
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:48,640
Others who don't know about us
all believe that you're single.

301
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,799
I saw a bunch of people surrounding you today.

302
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:53,952
Why are you laughing?

303
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,359
That's because

304
00:20:56,359 --> 00:20:59,039
my boyfriend seems a bit cute
when he's jealous.

305
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,720
You're overthinking.
Didn't you see that they were all girls?

306
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,279
Girls are not allowed either.

307
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,720
I'll go find them.

308
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,440
I'll see you after they leave.

309
00:21:43,079 --> 00:21:44,704
What are you looking at?

310
00:21:44,704 --> 00:21:46,200
They've all left.

311
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:48,519
You don't know how much effort I put in

312
00:21:48,519 --> 00:21:49,680
to send them back.

313
00:21:53,119 --> 00:21:55,880
I didn't know you could play the guitar.

314
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,680
I learned it when I was a kid.

315
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:01,039
Back then,
my mom wanted me to learn the violin,

316
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:02,200
but I insisted on learning the guitar.

317
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:05,279
As it turned out,
there was a guitar class next door, so I went.

318
00:22:06,119 --> 00:22:08,119
The kids in the guitar class were
quite interesting.

319
00:22:08,119 --> 00:22:09,279
Actually, many of them

320
00:22:09,279 --> 00:22:11,440
were not there to learn the guitar.

321
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:12,440
They just wanted to show off.

322
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:17,079
It's quite simple. I'll teach you a few tricks.

323
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,064
Okay.

324
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:26,759
In the beginning,

325
00:22:26,759 --> 00:22:29,000
you only need to learn a few simple chords
before you can sing along.

326
00:22:30,079 --> 00:22:31,319
Try strumming it.

327
00:22:31,319 --> 00:22:32,359
Which song do you want to learn?

328
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,799
The one you sang today.

329
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:37,440
Okay.

330
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,799
That song has four chords.

331
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:43,920
Then put your hand here and strum it once.
Yeah, just like that.

332
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:44,920
How about twice?

333
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:48,200

357
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:41,279
You're already awake?

358
00:24:42,759 --> 00:24:44,400
My dad asked me to intern.

359
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,119
He has reminded me a lot about it.

360
00:24:48,839 --> 00:24:52,240
Lin Yujing, how's your relationship
with Shen Juan? Tell us.

361
00:24:54,039 --> 00:24:56,079
Nothing special.

362
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:58,039
It's just normal.

363
00:24:58,039 --> 00:25:00,880
Come on. You're in a relationship,
yet I'm even more anxious than you.

364
00:25:01,839 --> 00:25:03,039
If you don't know how to date,

365
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:04,880
just come down. I'll give you some tips.

366
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:07,559
Little mushroom,
they're so familiar with each other.

367
00:25:07,559 --> 00:25:08,720
Don't worry about it.

368
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:12,440
How can you have a good relationship
if you don't give it a little push?

369
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:15,000
Haven't you seen those idol dramas?

370
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,640
The domineering CEO falls in love
with the intern secretary.

371
00:25:18,279 --> 00:25:20,319
All they need is a little push!

372
00:25:20,319 --> 00:25:23,680
Those dramas must have poisoned your brain.

373
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:25,400
Working is already tiring enough.

374
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,640
Who has time for a relationship?

375
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:32,359
What's wrong with it?

376
00:25:32,359 --> 00:25:34,799
It's normal for singles to fall in love
when they stay together all day long.

377
00:25:37,559 --> 00:25:39,839
You're going to intern today.

378
00:25:40,519 --> 00:25:43,279
What about you give it a try?

379
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,680
We are lawyers.

380
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:49,599
Professionalism matters the most. Understand?

381
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,480
Office romance is absolutely not allowed.

382
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,400
What time do you start work?
Is there still time?

383
00:25:55,359 --> 00:25:56,920
I really should go. I'll be late

384
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:58,920
Bye, I'm leaving.

385
00:25:58,920 --> 00:25:59,960
- You!
- Wish me luck!

386
00:26:01,559 --> 00:26:02,640
You, you, you!

387
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:04,519
I'll go back to sleep.

388
00:26:04,519 --> 00:26:05,759
Get up and date your man!

389
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:16,359
My name is Rong Huai.
I'm your shooting instructor for this semester.

390
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:20,039
I know many of you chose this course

391
00:26:20,039 --> 00:26:21,240
out of curiosity.

392
00:26:22,079 --> 00:26:26,799
But as long as you're here, you must
concentrate and follow my instructions.

393
00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:28,240
Practice makes perfect.

394
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:31,680
Alright, no more nonsense. Let's get started.

395
00:26:32,359 --> 00:26:34,960
Find your own position
according to the numbers just now.

396
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,160
Okay.

397
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,640
What's wrong? Feeling defeated?

398
00:27:11,319 --> 00:27:12,759
After a whole class,

399
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:14,400
I didn't hit a single shot.

400
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:20,000
It's okay.

401
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,240
Isn't this just the first class?

402
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:22,480
You just need to practice more.

403
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,039
You're right.

404
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,200
Otherwise, I'll probably fail this course.

405
00:27:28,079 --> 00:27:29,880
Your shooting skill is pretty well.

406
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:33,039
Let's go to that balloon stall again
when we're free. And you can teach me.

407
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:34,440
Okay, I'll think about it.

408
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,079
Think about it?

409
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:43,392
Shen Juan?

410
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,640
Shen Juan, why are you here?

411
00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:56,680
As soon as I joined the provincial team,
I found out that you had quit.

412
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:58,079
I couldn't reach you, no matter how I tried.

413
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:00,240
I thought you went to another team.

414
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,400
I couldn't find out anything about you.

415
00:28:03,839 --> 00:28:05,000
I'm not practicing shooting anymore.

416
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:07,839
Why not?

417
00:28:07,839 --> 00:28:08,960
You were so good at it.

418
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:14,400
Shen Juan, do you know?

419
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:17,440
I practiced shooting because of you.
If you quit, I…

420
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:18,720
Rong Huai,

421
00:28:21,519 --> 00:28:22,519
I've already let it go.

422
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:27,840
You should keep going.

423
00:28:29,599 --> 00:28:31,328
Let's go.

424
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,359
Welcome.

425
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:49,119
Hurry up! We're running out of time!

426
00:28:49,119 --> 00:28:50,319
I still have to punch in.

427
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,559
Welcome.

428
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:11,599
Welcome.

429
00:29:26,759 --> 00:29:28,240
How could I forget to bring my card?

430
00:29:29,519 --> 00:29:31,079
Can you help me get to the seventh floor?

431
00:29:31,799 --> 00:29:34,000
You know, the Jinqiao Law Firm.

432
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,920
You must know about it since you work here.

433
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:38,000
My client is waiting for me upstairs.

434
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:47,584
Thank you!

435
00:30:00,425 --> 00:30:04,041
<i>[Pucheng Jinqiao Baixin Law Firm]</i>

436
00:30:17,209 --> 00:30:21,279
<i>[Pucheng Jinqiao Baixin Law Firm]</i>

437
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:22,680
Your dad barely asks anyone for a favor.

438
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:25,319
But for you, he called me many times.

439
00:30:25,319 --> 00:30:27,000
I'll let you work with Mr. Fu.

440
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
He is the best among our peers.

441
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,200
You should follow him and study well.

442
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:32,359
- Thank you, Uncle Shen.
- You're welcome.

443
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,759
Mingxiu, this is Gu Xia.
The girl I told you before.

444
00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:48,720
You should guide her and teach her.

445
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,599
Okay.

446
00:30:50,599 --> 00:30:51,720
Alright. I'll be leaving.

447
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:05,000
Mr. Fu, I'm sorry.

448
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,880
I'm new to the workplace and inexperienced.

449
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:08,039
I hit the morning rush hour and missed
the person who was supposed to pick me up.

450
00:31:08,039 --> 00:31:10,759
- I was in a hurry, so I…
- Alright, stop.

451
00:31:10,759 --> 00:31:11,920
Making excuses won't help.

452
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:14,279
If you want to work in a law firm,

453
00:31:14,279 --> 00:31:16,279
honesty and keeping promises are
the most basic principles.

454
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:20,599
Also, you're just a freshman.

455
00:31:21,319 --> 00:31:23,480
You lack professional knowledge
and social experience.

456
00:31:24,279 --> 00:31:26,519
You won't learn anything from
starting an internship directly.

457
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:30,319
Moreover, you have to bustle
between the law firm and the school.

458
00:31:30,319 --> 00:31:31,720
It's simply a waste of time.

459
00:31:32,519 --> 00:31:34,000
Studying is important,

460
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,640
but so is practice.

461
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:37,119
I don't understand anything,

462
00:31:37,119 --> 00:31:38,400
and that's exactly
why I came to learn from you.

463
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:40,559
Mr. Shen told me

464
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:42,640
you're the best lawyer among your peers.

465
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,160
I believe that
a good teacher produces outstanding students.

466
00:31:44,759 --> 00:31:46,319
I'd love to learn from you from now on.

467
00:31:52,599 --> 00:31:53,720
Then go to the HR department first

468
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:55,720
and go through your internship procedures.

469
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:12,839
What's wrong with you?
Why are your hands shaking?

470
00:32:12,839 --> 00:32:14,304
Steady!

471
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:24,519
Don't you have to train? Why are you here?

472
00:32:24,519 --> 00:32:27,039
Coach Yu let us rest for thirty minutes.

473
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:32,160
Coach, I saw Shen Juan yesterday.

474
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:35,160
He got into Pucheng University.

475
00:32:38,839 --> 00:32:40,640
Back then, Coach Xu

476
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:42,119
personally trained Shen Juan.

477
00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:44,440
He could have joined the Youth Olympic team.

478
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:50,079
Why do you care?
You could have gone to the sports field

479
00:32:50,079 --> 00:32:51,519
and run a few laps to train
your physical fitness.

480
00:32:52,599 --> 00:32:54,680
Coach, I'm just anxious.

481
00:32:55,519 --> 00:32:57,559
If we can't get any good results,

482
00:32:57,559 --> 00:32:58,880
our funding will be cut in half next year.

483
00:32:59,559 --> 00:33:02,000
Now, the only one we can count on is Shen Juan.

484
00:33:05,079 --> 00:33:06,960
Don't pin your hopes on others.

485
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:10,960
Improving yourself and getting good results is
the most important, understand?

486
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:14,519
But I still want to persuade Shen Juan.

487
00:33:15,599 --> 00:33:18,599
He's talented and once had great results.

488
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:21,839
It's a pity for him to give up.

489
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,319
Coach, if he could come back,

490
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:30,079
would you be willing to teach him?

491
00:33:34,599 --> 00:33:37,160
He hasn't practiced for four years.
And you know it.

492
00:33:37,759 --> 00:33:39,359
It won't be easy to get his results back.

493
00:33:41,359 --> 00:33:43,359
Are you saying that
he doesn't even have a chance?

494
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,039
All done.

495
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:00,079
Please show me your ID.

496
00:34:08,599 --> 00:34:11,119
Sorry, I forgot to bring my ID.

497
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:12,880
It's okay. Bring it to me next time.

498
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:14,400
I'll arrange a workstation for you later.

499
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:16,704
Thank you.

500
00:34:16,704 --> 00:34:17,840
Here,

501
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:20,440
this is your workstation.

502
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:22,656
Thank you.

503
00:34:38,506 --> 00:34:40,448
<i>[Gu Xia]</i>

504
00:35:08,559 --> 00:35:09,984
Come in.

505
00:35:18,039 --> 00:35:19,264
Thank you.

506
00:35:24,639 --> 00:35:26,199
Is there anything I can do now?

507
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:30,159
Where is your work badge?

508
00:35:30,159 --> 00:35:31,440
Haven't you completed the procedures yet?

509
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:34,119
I forgot my ID today.

510
00:35:35,639 --> 00:35:36,960
If the procedures are not done,

511
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,400
you're not a staff member here.

512
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,920
I can't assign work to you.

513
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:41,760
Rather than sitting here all day,

514
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:42,920
you might as well go back early.

515
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:45,719
But the HR said…

516
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:49,239
When you leave, please close the door for me.

517
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:51,456
Thanks.

518
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:08,760
Lin, I need a favor.

519
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:10,719
I forgot my ID card.

520
00:36:10,719 --> 00:36:11,880
Could you help me deliver it?

521
00:36:13,056 --> 00:36:14,079
Send me the address.

522
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:15,519
<i>Okay, thank you!</i>

523
00:36:17,519 --> 00:36:19,360
<i>Let's have lunch together.</i>

524
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:22,272
<i>Okay.</i>

525
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:29,079
<i>Wait for me after class.
I'll come to find you.</i>

526
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:36,159
Mr. Fu, can you assign work to me now?

527
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:47,679
Okay, then you can help
sort out this class action case

528
00:36:47,679 --> 00:36:48,920
and deliver it to all parties today.

529
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:51,168
Okay.

530
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:12,119
Shen Juan, are you free? Let's talk.

531
00:37:17,039 --> 00:37:18,679
Shen Juan, I understand

532
00:37:18,679 --> 00:37:20,199
you won't tell me why you left,

533
00:37:20,199 --> 00:37:22,480
so I won't ask you again.

534
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:26,159
I just want you to come back.

535
00:37:26,159 --> 00:37:28,639
The National University Games
will be held next March.

536
00:37:28,639 --> 00:37:31,480
Shen Juan, if you come back
and continue training, it's still not too late.

537
00:37:32,039 --> 00:37:35,199
Rong Huai, I've quit for four years.

538
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:37,960
Do you know

539
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:39,424
what four years mean to an athlete?

540
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:42,840
You don't need to worry about this.

541
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:45,599
Xue from the provincial team
also gave up shooting midway.

542
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:47,119
But after two years of training,

543
00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:49,559
he won a medal in the Provincial Sports Meet
the year before last.

544
00:37:50,559 --> 00:37:52,519
Medals are no longer important to me.

545
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:05,360
I can't accept it.

546
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:08,599
Shen Juan,
you clearly have talent and opportunity.

547
00:38:08,599 --> 00:38:10,360
You have the ability to reach the peak.

548
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:13,119
How could you give up halfway up the mountain?

549
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:26,912
Rong Huai,

550
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:30,079
there's no place for me up there.

551
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:32,880
Now I can only struggle
at the bottom of the mountain.

552
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:38,920
Shen Juan, wait a moment.

553
00:38:47,001 --> 00:38:48,320
<i>[Pucheng Junior Shooting Team
Prepares for National Championship]</i>

554
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,559
Do you remember?

555
00:38:49,559 --> 00:38:52,840
This was our assistant coach, Coach Lei.

556
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:54,239
Now he is the main coach of Pucheng University.

557
00:38:56,719 --> 00:38:59,039
If you ask him now,
there might still be a chance.

558
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:15,920
Shen Juan, please think about this, okay?

559
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:20,960
The past is the past.

560
00:39:22,159 --> 00:39:23,199
Let's not mention it again.

561
00:39:42,559 --> 00:39:44,064
Let's go.

562
00:39:48,559 --> 00:39:51,440
I heard what you were saying just now.

563
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:12,239
When I was in the sixth grade
of elementary school,

564
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:14,000
I got into shooting

565
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:16,519
and met Rong Huai.

566
00:40:17,519 --> 00:40:18,960
He is two years younger than me.

567
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:20,960
We shared a dormitory.

568
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:23,559
The training during the day was pretty tough.

569
00:40:24,679 --> 00:40:25,800
When we got back in the evening,

570
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:27,239
he would hide in his blanket and cry.

571
00:40:29,639 --> 00:40:31,199
I could never get a good night's sleep.

572
00:40:32,559 --> 00:40:34,320
So I dragged him out of bed

573
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:36,360
and took him to run around the sports field.

574
00:40:38,119 --> 00:40:39,239
And after that,

575
00:40:39,239 --> 00:40:41,360
he could immediately fall asleep
as soon as he lay down.

576
00:40:43,519 --> 00:40:45,119
What were you training for at the time?

577
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:46,719
Rapid fire.

578
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:48,736
Why this?

579
00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:50,960
When I was a kid, the teacher said

580
00:40:52,119 --> 00:40:53,719
China's first gold medal

581
00:40:53,719 --> 00:40:55,159
was won in the shooting event

582
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:59,239
at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics.

583
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:02,639
So, since childhood,

584
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:05,199
I've always admired

585
00:41:05,199 --> 00:41:06,599
the champions who won glory for our country.

586
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:10,800
I think their lives are incredibly cool.

587
00:41:15,639 --> 00:41:17,159
You're already pretty cool.

588
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:24,920
When I was young, I was just a slacker.

589
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:27,639
I had no aspirations or dreams.

590
00:41:27,639 --> 00:41:29,000
It seemed like I was always

591
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,840
going through exams and studying.

592
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:34,039
My mom chose my high school,

593
00:41:34,039 --> 00:41:35,920
and she chose my college major.

594
00:41:36,719 --> 00:41:39,599
It's as if I've always been
walking the path she has laid out for me.

595
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:42,920
I've never figured out

596
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:44,480
what I want to do in the future

597
00:41:45,159 --> 00:41:47,280
or what kind of person I can become.

598
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:51,000
But you're different.

599
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:55,159
You have aspirations and dreams.

600
00:41:55,679 --> 00:41:57,480
And you know what you want.

601
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:02,880
So, no matter what happens,

602
00:42:04,679 --> 00:42:06,199
you should do it if you like it.

603
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:08,119
You should strive for what you want.

604
00:42:09,159 --> 00:42:10,320
No matter the outcome,

605
00:42:11,599 --> 00:42:14,400
don't be afraid and don't hide from it.

606
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:20,119
After all, you can do anything you want, right?

607
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:49,159
<i>I secretly said I miss you.</i>

608
00:42:49,159 --> 00:42:51,519
<i>You gave me an incredibly brilliant world.</i>

609
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:55,079
<i>I'll give my daydreams to you.</i>

610
00:43:10,241 --> 00:43:14,785
<i>♫ Love sprouts in my palm ♫</i>

611
00:43:16,097 --> 00:43:19,937
<i>♫ Yet worried linger within my eyes ♫</i>

612
00:43:21,729 --> 00:43:26,305

00:43:48,577 --> 00:43:54,625

00:44:02,593 --> 00:44:07,265

<i>♫ Do you want to hear me sing ♫</i>

624
00:44:23,079 --> 00:44:27,841

<i>♫ To dye the whole mountain red ♫</i>

630

00:44:55,617 --> 00:45:00,545
<i>♫ Was painted by our brilliant dreams ♫</i>
