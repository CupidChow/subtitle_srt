<i>[Episode 20 Can't I Decide My Own Life]</i>

19
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,680
You've must have noticed it, right?

20
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,080
Your first shot took too long to
hit the target.

21
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,439
You only had eight seconds to shoot,

22
00:02:40,439 --> 00:02:42,400
yet you took almost three seconds to aim.

23
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,639
This resulted in the rest of your shooting
being disrupted,

24
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:46,080
and you lost stability.

25
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:49,879
Why?

26
00:02:49,879 --> 00:02:51,104
It's been six weeks.

27
00:02:51,104 --> 00:02:52,479
And you still can't solve this problem.

28
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,800
I used the initial trigger stop.

29
00:02:55,439 --> 00:02:57,879
It took longer than firing on the move.

30
00:02:57,879 --> 00:02:59,639
Besides, I used a model gun.

31
00:02:59,639 --> 00:03:01,800
I also have to simulate
the recoil after firing,

32
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:02,960
keeping it within the normal sight picture.

33
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,096
Nonsense!

34
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:08,000
You should consider recoil
when using a model gun.

35
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,960
Why is your first shot slow to aim?

36
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,639
You know it better than anyone else.

37
00:03:11,639 --> 00:03:13,824
You haven't let go of your past.

38
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,719
If you want to
overcome your fears with techniques,

39
00:03:16,719 --> 00:03:18,000
you must practice a lot

40
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,488
to form muscle memory.

41
00:03:20,439 --> 00:03:22,120
So why can't you do it now?

42
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,479
It proves you haven't practiced enough!

43
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,960
Coach, I want to use a real gun.

44
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:34,879
Coach, coach!

45
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,639
There's not much time left
for the National University Games.

46
00:03:39,639 --> 00:03:40,640
Are you sure?

47
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,199
You haven't solved your problems.

48
00:03:43,719 --> 00:03:45,080
Are you really going
to use up those five bullets?

49
00:03:53,919 --> 00:03:57,759
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

50
00:03:57,759 --> 00:03:59,744
Two, two, three, four,

51
00:03:59,744 --> 00:04:01,719
- five, six, seven, eight.
- Captain!

52
00:04:04,039 --> 00:04:05,088
Why are you late?

53
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,360
I left my sleeve guard at the training ground.
I just went back to get it.

54
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,639
You're always forgetful.

55
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:12,840
Captain, don't scold him.

56
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,439
There's still one person missing.

57
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,639
I don't know where he has been.

58
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,360
You mean Shen Juan?

59
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,800
It's normal for him not to want to come.

60
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:23,120
It's been six weeks,
yet he hasn't touched a real gun once.

61
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:25,680
He spent all day messing with that model gun.

62
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,136
How can he possibly get good results?

63
00:04:27,639 --> 00:04:28,879
If you ask me,

64
00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:30,439
it's a miracle that he's managed

65
00:04:30,439 --> 00:04:31,839
stick it out until now.

66
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:33,680
What nonsense are you talking about?

67
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,040
Shen Juan would never give up halfway.

68
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:37,920
Captain,

69
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,079
if you were to simulate

70
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:40,319
the recoil after firing during practice

71
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:42,160
and still controlled it
within the fourth quadrant,

72
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,639
can you do it?

73
00:04:43,639 --> 00:04:44,959
In theory, yes.

74
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:46,800
Why do you ask?

75
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,439
When I went to get my sleeve guard,

76
00:04:48,439 --> 00:04:49,879
I heard Shen Juan talking to the coach.

77
00:04:49,879 --> 00:04:52,240
He always had to simulate
the recoil after firing during practice

78
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,439
while keeping it steady.

79
00:04:53,439 --> 00:04:55,040
The coach told him that
this technique is the basic.

80
00:04:55,839 --> 00:04:56,864
Shen Juan?

81
00:04:57,439 --> 00:04:58,464
That can't be!

82
00:04:59,079 --> 00:05:00,920
Is he some sort of gyroscope sensor module?

83
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,720
It's just that you guys can't do it.

84
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,879
But Shen Juan is different.

85
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,439
He had practiced to the maximum level
and then started all over,

86
00:05:08,439 --> 00:05:10,240
so he still got his old tricks.

87
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,240
You're just bragging!

88
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,519
It's just a pair of earmuffs.
Why do you have to make a fuss about it?

89
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:30,399
You know nothing.

90
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:31,920
It's called well-prepared.

91
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,264
Bye!

92
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,288
Shen Juan,

93
00:05:57,519 --> 00:05:59,199
I heard that Coach Lei
won't let you use a real gun.

94
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:01,399
This is only temporary.

95
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,720
You'll definitely be able to participate
in the National University Games in March.

96
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,160
I know what to do.

97
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,448
Shen Juan.

98
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:17,120
- I'll be leaving then.
- Okay. Bye.

99
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:24,959
I saw you were busy,
so I came straight to you.

100
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:28,600
Yes, the coach told me,

101
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,680
to facilitate my training,

102
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,160
he asked me to move
to the shooting team's dormitory.

103
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,519
That's great.

104
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:35,279
We can see each other more often.

105
00:06:52,519 --> 00:06:54,304
Shen Juan,
I've been looking forward to your return.

106
00:06:54,304 --> 00:06:55,328
I helped you make your bed.

107
00:06:57,439 --> 00:06:58,464
Thanks a lot.

108
00:06:59,879 --> 00:07:01,360
Captain.

109
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,720
Don't you have class today?
You came back so early.

110
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,712
Since you're here, let's have dinner together.

111
00:07:07,712 --> 00:07:09,040
After all, we're going to live here
for two years as a team.

112
00:07:12,279 --> 00:07:13,408
Two years, huh?

113
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:20,360
I think someone should just
try to get through this training camp first.

114
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,600
There's no need to quarrel.

115
00:07:26,439 --> 00:07:27,552
I didn't come back this time

116
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,800
to prove myself to anyone.

117
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:45,984
Shen Juan,

118
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:48,519
I saw our captain's resume before.

119
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,759
He seemed to have also participated

120
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:52,439
in the National Youth Shooting Championship.

121
00:07:53,839 --> 00:07:54,880
Really?

122
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:56,839
I don't remember that.

123
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:13,376
You didn't give him the gift.

124
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,279
No. The timing was not right.

125
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,360
Timing? Is that even necessary?

126
00:08:19,959 --> 00:08:21,639
You made it even more troublesome
than writing my thesis.

127
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,608
How long have you been writing your thesis?

128
00:08:24,608 --> 00:08:26,199
What's wrong? Are you stuck?

129
00:08:26,199 --> 00:08:27,552
I just have this feeling, you know?

130
00:08:27,552 --> 00:08:29,480
The more I learn, the more stupid I've become.

131
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,600
I think I'm drowning in these documents.

132
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,799
Don't you know

133
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:36,399
how to ask for help?

134
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,264
Lin Yujing,

135
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:42,120
sometimes, your words really make sense.

136
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:55,519
<i>Mr. Fu, I need some advice.</i>

137
00:09:15,159 --> 00:09:17,279
I'm writing a thesis on jurisprudence.

138
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:21,720
I have decided on the subject,
but I don't know where to start.

139
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,159
I'd like to ask for your advice.

140
00:09:23,159 --> 00:09:24,512
I'm still busy.

141
00:09:24,512 --> 00:09:26,320
Go ahead. I'll give you two minutes.

142
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,399
Well, it's…

143
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,024
Captain,

144
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:38,919
I was busy with my department's affairs today.

145
00:10:38,919 --> 00:10:40,039
I had asked Coach Lei for a leave.

146
00:10:40,799 --> 00:10:41,799
I'll make up for
this morning's physical training

147
00:10:41,799 --> 00:10:42,919
at the sports field right now.

148
00:10:56,799 --> 00:10:58,000
The captain was watching you just now.

149
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:01,360
Coach Lei agreed to let you use a real gun?

150
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,840
Great! I knew it!

151
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:06,240
When you simulated the recoil after firing,

152
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,360
Coach Lei must have been very satisfied

153
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,679
even though he didn't say anything.

154
00:11:10,639 --> 00:11:12,120
It's just an empty gun without bullets.

155
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,799
Coach Lei only agreed to let me

156
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:16,080
practice the initial trigger stop.

157
00:11:17,919 --> 00:11:19,960
Why doesn't he agree to
let you use the bullets?

158
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,639
If you keep going like this,
you can't get a good result in the match.

159
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:23,720
There's a big difference
between an empty gun and live ammunition.

160
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,360
Just focus on yourself.

161
00:11:29,679 --> 00:11:30,944
Well, I'll go running.

162
00:11:31,759 --> 00:11:32,960
Keep going, Shen Juan.

163
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,048
Bye.

164
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,360
<i>See you at the cafe at ten o'clock tonight.</i>

165
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:16,992
Over here!

166
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:19,120
Sorry.

167
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,600
The training ran a little late.

168
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:21,639
I haven't been here long, either.

169
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,960
I took these physics notes for you.

170
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,024
Take a look.

171
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,879
You went to sit in again?

172
00:12:27,879 --> 00:12:29,159
When did you go?

173
00:12:29,159 --> 00:12:30,440
It didn't take much time.

174
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:31,840
I got these from Sun Mingchuan.

175
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:42,304
This information

176
00:12:43,159 --> 00:12:44,559
is quite useful for me.

177
00:12:47,759 --> 00:12:49,440
But I'm just afraid
it will bother your revision.

178
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:51,679
No, it won't.

179
00:12:51,679 --> 00:12:53,000
Trust me.

180
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,200
I can manage my own time.

181
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,279
Besides,

182
00:12:56,279 --> 00:12:58,600
freshman physics questions
are pretty easy for me.

183
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,080
After the exam,

184
00:13:05,679 --> 00:13:06,679
I'll spend more time with you.

185
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,519
Check it.

186
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:12,576
No rush.

187
00:13:35,019 --> 00:13:40,320
<i>[Wishing all students good results
in the final exam]</i>

188
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,480
Finally! The exam is over!

189
00:13:42,159 --> 00:13:44,879
I just hope I wouldn't fail any of my courses.

190
00:13:44,879 --> 00:13:46,600
Yeah, that's all we ordinary students hope for.

191
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,559
We don't need to be as ambitious as Master Lin.

192
00:13:52,919 --> 00:13:54,176
What's wrong?

193
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:56,159
You didn't do well on the exam?

194
00:13:56,159 --> 00:13:58,480
One of my elective courses is a bit tricky.

195
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,712
Tricky?

196
00:13:59,712 --> 00:14:01,320
What is that supposed to mean
to a top student like you?

197
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:03,072
Not getting a perfect score?

198
00:14:03,072 --> 00:14:05,000
I've been taking notes for Shen Juan recently.

199
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,200
So I missed a few classes.

200
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,232
I'm definitely going to lose some points.

201
00:14:07,232 --> 00:14:09,152
Oh, so it's just an elective course.

202
00:14:09,152 --> 00:14:10,720
You can make up the scores next semester.

203
00:14:14,919 --> 00:14:16,000
By the way,

204
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,120
do you think the delivery
can arrive in two days?

205
00:14:19,399 --> 00:14:21,720
Are you still shopping online?
The holiday is just around the corner.

206
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:23,480
The delivery probably won't arrive
after you go home.

207
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:27,159
My family bought a new house
in Pucheng this year.

208
00:14:27,159 --> 00:14:29,799
According to tradition,
we should celebrate the New Year here.

209
00:14:29,799 --> 00:14:31,399
My parents will be here in two days.

210
00:14:31,399 --> 00:14:32,480
I need to buy some daily necessities first.

211
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:37,600
What are you and Shen Juan
planning for the holiday?

212
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:41,679
Never mind, don't answer me.

213
00:14:41,679 --> 00:14:42,784
Your affection is probably too much for me.

214
00:14:43,879 --> 00:14:45,440
What affection?

215
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,720
He's busy training.

216
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,080
I better not disturb him.

217
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,240
Come on. Gather around.

218
00:15:07,919 --> 00:15:09,159
The National University Games is in March.

219
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:11,200
We have limited time and heavy tasks.

220
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,159
So, no winter vacation.

221
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:15,879
But I will give each of you
five floating holidays.

222
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,000
During the holidays,

223
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,279
you must do basic training every day,

224
00:15:20,279 --> 00:15:21,720
as well as twenty sets of
weightlifting with a gun.

225
00:15:22,679 --> 00:15:24,679
You must record a video of
your training and send it to me.

226
00:15:24,679 --> 00:15:26,399
- Understand?
- Yes, sir!

227
00:15:27,159 --> 00:15:28,160
Dismissed.

228
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,296
Coach,

229
00:15:38,759 --> 00:15:40,159
I want to

230
00:15:40,159 --> 00:15:41,639
apply for that floating holiday.

231
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:46,480
You're already falling behind.
And now you still want to take a leave?

232
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,279
I will make up

233
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:51,200
for the missed training indicators doubly.

234
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,376
Please approve my leave.

235
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:03,159
During your leave,

236
00:16:03,159 --> 00:16:04,639
you can't miss a single day of training.

237
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:06,944
I won't.

238
00:16:06,944 --> 00:16:07,960
Thank you, coach.

239
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,024
Go ahead.

240
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:11,488
Coach,

241
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:14,880
I've made up my mind.

242
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:18,176
I want to use that magazine clip.

243
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:44,384
Get ready.

244
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:04,839
I'm sorry, coach.

245
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:09,559
You can go now.

246
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,519
Starting from tomorrow,

247
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:23,519
you'll practice with live ammunition.

248
00:17:30,839 --> 00:17:31,936
What are you waiting for?

249
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:35,160
Honestly, I am already impressed

250
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,240
that you managed to hit three targets.

251
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:39,599
I can train your skills, reactions,

252
00:17:39,599 --> 00:17:41,279
and fitness.

253
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,519
But you have to overcome your past on your own.

254
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,839
You can even bear the pressure of
quitting if you can't prove yourself.

255
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:55,599
So, I believe

256
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,759
you can coexist with
that hurdle from four years ago.

257
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:02,039
And one day, you will turn it into
your motivation to go forward.

258
00:18:03,799 --> 00:18:05,240
Face it, and break through it.

259
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:09,119
You are still that Shen Juan
who makes everyone proud.

260
00:18:22,599 --> 00:18:24,920
You're finishing early today.
No extra training?

261
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,880
Yeah.

262
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,416
I brought you a gift.

263
00:18:28,416 --> 00:18:29,568
Open it.

264
00:18:41,519 --> 00:18:43,319
I hope it can accompany you
whenever you need it.

265
00:18:43,319 --> 00:18:44,559
May it bring you a good result.

266
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,488
Thank you,

267
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,504
I really like it.

268
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,039
I used live ammunition

269
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:02,976
in my training today.

270
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:13,559
I didn't expect a magazine clip
to have such a deep meaning.

271
00:19:13,559 --> 00:19:15,119
Coach Lei is so amazing.

272
00:19:15,119 --> 00:19:16,160
He is.

273
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,720
How many days can you rest this time?

274
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,039
Isn't the competition in March?

275
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,599
Anyway, it's enough for us to enjoy a trip.

276
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:26,528
Where do you want to go?

277
00:19:28,519 --> 00:19:29,759
I'm okay with anything. It's up to you.

278
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:33,359
Alright.

279
00:19:33,359 --> 00:19:34,359
Then close your eyes.

280
00:19:52,039 --> 00:19:53,440
You'll choose where we're going.

281
00:19:54,039 --> 00:19:56,200
Wherever your finger lands, we'll go there.

282
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,280
Okay.

283
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,280
Well, here it is.

284
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:05,079
It's a nice place!

285
00:20:05,079 --> 00:20:06,920
Xu Ruyi said her parents are working there.

286
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:08,240
The sunset by the sea is so beautiful.

287
00:20:08,839 --> 00:20:10,240
Alright.

288
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,296
Whatever you say.

289
00:20:35,599 --> 00:20:38,000
Da Huang!

290
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:46,528
Stop right there!

291
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,104
Stop!

292
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:58,799
I'm telling you,

293
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:01,359
if you weren't Professor Zhou's darling,

294
00:21:01,359 --> 00:21:02,359
you wouldn't be in this cage now,

295
00:21:02,359 --> 00:21:03,759
you'd be in a pot, got it?

296
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,480
You'd better learn from your mistake!

297
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:57,952
<i>You did well on the old exam this time.</i>

298
00:21:57,952 --> 00:21:59,759
<i>It seems that your practice actually works.</i>

299
00:21:59,759 --> 00:22:01,720
<i>Keep it up every day, okay?</i>

300
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:02,912
<i>Keep going!</i>

301
00:22:08,039 --> 00:22:09,160
Ah, love!

302
00:22:20,123 --> 00:22:22,336
<i>[Tickets from Pucheng to Macau are ready]</i>

303
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:30,400
<i>Lin Yujing, can you help me out?</i>

304
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,640
<i>I'm trying to grab a train ticket to Xiamen.</i>

305
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:36,559
<i>Do you need more help?</i>

306
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,480
<i>Yes, of course!</i>

307
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:41,039
<i>I'll find someone to help you.</i>

308
00:22:43,839 --> 00:22:45,000
<i>He,</i>

309
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,640
<i>Xu Ruyi is trying to
grab a train ticket to Xiamen.</i>

310
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:49,440
<i>Now it's your chance!</i>

311
00:22:50,319 --> 00:22:51,400
<i>Thank you so much!</i>

312
00:23:18,519 --> 00:23:20,559
I heard from Lin Yujing that
you're trying to grab a train ticket.

313
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:22,799
Send me your ID info. I'll try to help.

314
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:26,960
No need. I can do it myself.

315
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:29,200
I often play games.
I'll be faster if I try to buy the ticket.

316
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,599
More help will bring more chances, right?

317
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,759
Alright. If you get the ticket,
I'll treat you to dinner.

318
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,880
No need. A coffee is enough.

319
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:43,359
By the way,
I don't have much to do after the exam.

320
00:23:43,359 --> 00:23:45,640
Do you where I can go to have some fun?

321
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:46,920
I'll go there.

322
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:48,559
But I'm not very familiar with your city.

323
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:52,039
Have fun?

324
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:54,559
There's a bay nearby.

325
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:56,799
Alright. If I help you get the ticket,

326
00:23:56,799 --> 00:23:58,440
we'll go there together.

327
00:23:58,440 --> 00:23:59,759
See you then.

328
00:23:59,759 --> 00:24:00,880
Alright.

329
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,000
Okay, bye.

330
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:18,160
He.

331
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:19,359
Professor Zhou.

332
00:24:19,359 --> 00:24:22,000
You're watching this tomato plant every day.

333
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,680
I'm really afraid you'll go crazy.

334
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:27,440
I planted three before,
and they finally bore fruits.

335
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:28,880
But they were all ruined

336
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,519
by your precious chicken.

337
00:24:30,519 --> 00:24:31,599
Fortunately, I managed to

338
00:24:31,599 --> 00:24:32,920
save this one last plant.

339
00:24:36,079 --> 00:24:37,279
That indeed sounds tough.

340
00:24:43,559 --> 00:24:45,319
Since this is the only one left,

341
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:47,279
why did you dig it out?

342
00:25:01,599 --> 00:25:03,079
Thank you for coming out with me today.

343
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:05,240
Now this is what holidays should be like.

344
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:07,839
And thank you for helping me grab the ticket.

345
00:25:08,839 --> 00:25:10,279
You're welcome.

346
00:25:10,279 --> 00:25:11,640
You helped me with my English.

347
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:13,359
And during the exam,

348
00:25:13,359 --> 00:25:15,200
I could finally answer more questions.

349
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,440
I should thank you.

350
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:19,136
It's all because of your hard work.

351
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,880
Are you going to Xiamen for a holiday?

352
00:25:24,119 --> 00:25:25,920
My family is in Xiamen.

353
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:29,039
I want to go back and celebrate
the Chinese New Year with them.

354
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:31,319
But I couldn't get the ticket no matter what.

355
00:25:31,319 --> 00:25:33,000
How did you manage to get me a ticket?

356
00:25:34,039 --> 00:25:37,240
It's all about speed and patience.

357
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:39,000
As long as you need it, I'll do it anyway.

358
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:52,576
Here,

359
00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:56,000
try this.

360
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,544
How is it?

361
00:26:01,559 --> 00:26:03,720
It tastes exactly like what I ate
when I was a kid.

362
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,039
Where did you buy it?

363
00:26:06,039 --> 00:26:07,264
I grew it.

364
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,312
You told me before

365
00:26:09,312 --> 00:26:11,640
that when you were little,
the tomatoes that your family grew tasted good.

366
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:12,880
So I wanted to try it.

367
00:26:13,599 --> 00:26:14,839
Luckily, it bore fruit this time.

368
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:17,680
I didn't expect

369
00:26:18,359 --> 00:26:20,039
that you can still remember
what I casually mentioned before.

370
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,240
It has been a long time.

371
00:26:23,119 --> 00:26:24,640
Actually, I wasn't very sure either.

372
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:27,240
I was worried it wasn't the variety you liked.

373
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:29,839
But seeing you like it now,

374
00:26:29,839 --> 00:26:30,848
I'm also very happy.

375
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:38,839
There's something I want to ask you for help.

376
00:26:38,839 --> 00:26:40,096
What is it?

377
00:26:51,319 --> 00:26:52,640
Now I'm

378
00:26:53,519 --> 00:26:54,560
giving it to you.

379
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:57,279
Would you

380
00:26:58,279 --> 00:26:59,559
take care of it with me?

381
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:09,839
If you remain silent, I'll take it as a yes.

382
00:27:47,839 --> 00:27:49,519
I sent Orange to Wang Yiyang.

383
00:27:49,519 --> 00:27:50,720
He can definitely take good care of it.

384
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:07,264
Shen Juan, look.

385
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:14,720
Well, it took him a long time
to get what he wanted.

386
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,559
But the result is great. They're a couple now.

387
00:28:17,839 --> 00:28:19,040
That's true.

388
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:30,079
<i>He,</i>

389
00:28:30,079 --> 00:28:31,920
<i>when did you and Xu Ruyi…</i>

390
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:33,088
<i>When did this happen?</i>

391
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:35,799
<i>You really let me down, you know.</i>

392
00:28:35,799 --> 00:28:37,519
<i>I'm the only single one left in the group.</i>

393
00:28:37,519 --> 00:28:38,752
<i>This is too much. Too much!</i>

394
00:28:38,752 --> 00:28:40,839
<i>I don't care. You have to treat us.</i>

395
00:28:40,839 --> 00:28:41,952
<i>You lost.</i>

396
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:44,519
<i>You lost.</i>

397
00:28:44,519 --> 00:28:45,824
It's about time.

398
00:28:45,824 --> 00:28:47,008
Let's head to the airport.

399
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,119
It's almost time for boarding.

400
00:29:18,039 --> 00:29:20,000
I didn't expect my mom to
call me back to Huaicheng suddenly.

401
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:23,759
It's ok.
I'll go back and let Coach Lei cancel my leave.

402
00:29:23,759 --> 00:29:25,400
We can go to Xiamen when you come back.

403
00:29:29,359 --> 00:29:31,759
Remember to let me know when you arrive.

404
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:34,599
I'll contact you as soon as I land.

405
00:29:34,599 --> 00:29:36,480
You might be too engrossed
in your training by then

406
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:37,480
and forget about me.

407
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:52,039
Give me the phone number of your home.

408
00:29:53,599 --> 00:29:55,720
Well, well. You're so thoughtful.

409
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:58,160
Just in case, you know.

410
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:00,799
I don't want to lose contact with you
for any reason.

411
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,200
All done.

412
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,792
I'm leaving.

413
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:13,696
Okay.

414
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:16,960
Bye.

415
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:18,656
Bye.

416
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:22,080
Lin Yujing!

417
00:30:36,119 --> 00:30:37,240
Wait for me to come back, okay?

418
00:30:38,279 --> 00:30:39,296
Okay.

419
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:44,160
I'm leaving.

420
00:30:47,799 --> 00:30:48,960
Bye.

421
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,104
Bye.

422
00:31:16,359 --> 00:31:17,480
<i>I'm home.</i>

423
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:18,960
<i>I'll call you in a bit.</i>

424
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,096
<i>Okay.</i>

425
00:31:34,519 --> 00:31:35,519
I'm back.

426
00:31:38,039 --> 00:31:40,079
School is already on break.
Why did you come back so late?

427
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:42,816
Sit.

428
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:55,480
The school sent me this. Take a look.

429
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:01,880
Why is your GPA so low?

430
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:03,440
I missed a few elective classes.

431
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:05,440
But I can make it up the next semester.

432
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:09,344
Is that the point?

433
00:32:09,344 --> 00:32:10,559
Have you forgotten what you promised me

434
00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:12,319
when you wanted to go to Pucheng University?

435
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,279
Is this how you are
responsible for your actions?

436
00:32:23,319 --> 00:32:24,359
Shen Juan.

437
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:27,319
He was your deskmate, right?

438
00:32:30,279 --> 00:32:33,119
I've seen him.
He sent you home on New Year's Eve.

439
00:32:37,759 --> 00:32:39,119
Are you dating him?

440
00:32:41,319 --> 00:32:43,920
Is that the reason that
you got such a poor grade?

441
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:50,319
Is he the reason why you were
in such a hurry to go back to Pucheng?

442
00:33:01,319 --> 00:33:02,400
Yes.

443
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:04,079
I'm dating Shen Juan.

444
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:08,880
But my absence wasn't his fault. It was mine.

445
00:33:10,039 --> 00:33:11,119
There won't be a next time.

446
00:33:19,319 --> 00:33:21,000
I've already sent someone to
investigate your school.

447
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,816
According to their tutoring plan,

448
00:33:22,816 --> 00:33:24,160
every April,

449
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:27,519
there will be an opportunity to apply for
exchange at a foreign university.

450
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:28,799
You should start preparing for it.

451
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:31,559
I've told you before.
I don't want to go abroad.

452
00:33:31,559 --> 00:33:32,672
Lin Yujing,

453
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:35,904
all the plans I've made for you
are well thought out.

454
00:33:35,904 --> 00:33:37,519
They're all for your best interest.

455
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:42,599
I once thought that after I started university,

456
00:33:42,599 --> 00:33:44,079
you would treat me
as an independent human being.

457
00:33:44,079 --> 00:33:45,839
But now?
It seems like you haven't changed at all.

458
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:48,720
Have you ever respected me?

459
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:52,680
Haven't I ever respected you?

460
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:55,079
Didn't I agree to
let you go to Pucheng University?

461
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:58,720
And what did you get? This!

462
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:00,200
This is what you got!

463
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:01,960
Are you still responsible for your promise?

464
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:11,320
It's settled.

465
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:17,920
You should get prepared.
Now, go back to your room.

466
00:34:40,119 --> 00:34:41,599
Is that why you called me back?

467
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:45,400
Just for your lecture?

468
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:51,159
Meng Weiguo even treated me to a meal
when he asked me to come back.

469
00:34:52,199 --> 00:34:53,280
What did you just say?

470
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:55,360
What's the matter?

471
00:34:57,320 --> 00:35:00,320
Did I touch a nerve by mentioning
your only failure in life?

472
00:35:02,519 --> 00:35:05,440
Or am I also a failure, just like my dad?

473
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:07,584
Is that why you desperately
trying to make me into another you?

474
00:35:07,584 --> 00:35:08,864
Lin Yujing!

475
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:13,440
Did I say something wrong?

476
00:35:23,559 --> 00:35:24,880
Do you remember this bracelet?

477
00:35:26,039 --> 00:35:27,880
Do you remember when you taught me
how to write when I was little?

478
00:35:34,639 --> 00:35:36,719
That memory is my only comfort

479
00:35:36,719 --> 00:35:37,800
whenever you disappointed me.

480
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:43,440
I've told myself countless times

481
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:44,960
to obey you one more time.

482
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:46,440
Just one more time.

483
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:48,119
And then, you'll love me again.

484
00:36:00,519 --> 00:36:02,199
But now I realize,

485
00:36:02,199 --> 00:36:03,719
you've treated me like a robot since then.

486
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:11,679
I'll never expect anything from you again.

487
00:36:13,559 --> 00:36:14,920
And I'm not going abroad.

488
00:36:16,039 --> 00:36:17,039
Just give up.

489
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:25,344
Give it to me!

490
00:36:27,719 --> 00:36:28,864
Give it to me!

491
00:37:08,039 --> 00:37:09,679
<i>Contact me if you need anything.</i>

492
00:37:09,679 --> 00:37:10,720
<i>I'll wait for you.</i>

493
00:37:46,119 --> 00:37:47,360
<i>Do you remember this bracelet?</i>

494
00:37:48,519 --> 00:37:50,360
<i>Do you remember when you taught me
how to write when I was little?</i>

495
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:46,272
Lin Yujing!

496
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:14,960
We'll talk about it when we get back.

497
00:40:21,079 --> 00:40:22,440
You can sleep here tonight.

498
00:40:23,039 --> 00:40:24,840
I've changed the bed sheets
and the duvet cover for you.

499
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:28,416
What about you?

500
00:40:30,119 --> 00:40:32,440
I'll sleep on the couch outside, of course.

501
00:40:33,199 --> 00:40:34,400
So, if I sleep in your bed,

502
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:36,400
do I have to be responsible?

503
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:41,599
I mean be responsible for washing your sheets.

504
00:41:28,159 --> 00:41:29,280
You really are running a fever.

505
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:33,400
It's okay. Do you have any medicine at home?

506
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:35,119
I'll take it and have some sleep.
I'll be fine in the morning.

507
00:41:39,559 --> 00:41:40,960
Take the medicine and go to sleep.

508
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:07,008
Sleep tight.

509
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:08,864
Good night.

510
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:13,952
Good night.

511
00:42:30,039 --> 00:42:31,159
<i>I'm a little scared.</i>

512
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:33,840
<i>Reality has shattered me.</i>

513
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:36,000
<i>Dreams have always been illusions.</i>

514
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:38,360
<i>What should I do?</i>

515
00:42:41,159 --> 00:42:42,360
<i>You told me before.</i>

516
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:44,672
<i>Don't be afraid</i>

517
00:42:45,679 --> 00:42:46,848
<i>and don't hide from it.</i>

518
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:48,896
<i>It will be fine.</i>

519
00:42:49,639 --> 00:42:50,784
<i>I'm with you.</i>

520
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:53,088
<i>And I'll protect you.</i>

521
00:43:06,277 --> 00:43:10,821
<i>♫ Love sprouts in my palm ♫</i>

522
00:43:12,133 --> 00:43:15,973
<i>♫ Yet worried linger within my eyes ♫</i>

523
00:43:17,765 --> 00:43:22,341
<i>♫ Our story hasn't ended ♫</i>

524
00:43:23,269 --> 00:43:26,949
<i>♫ So where are we now ♫</i>

525
00:43:28,773 --> 00:43:34,437
<i>♫ I want to hug you so badly ♫</i>

526
00:43:34,437 --> 00:43:38,501
<i>♫ I want to become better with you ♫</i>

527
00:43:39,749 --> 00:43:44,613
<i>♫ The youth we shared ♫</i>

528
00:43:44,613 --> 00:43:50,661
<i>♫ Turned into a rainbow within my heart ♫</i>

529
00:43:51,173 --> 00:43:56,741
<i>♫ I really want to warm you ♫</i>

530
00:43:56,741 --> 00:43:58,629
<i>♫ I want to share with you ♫</i>

531
00:43:58,629 --> 00:44:03,301
<i>♫ The beauty of the world ♫</i>

532
00:44:04,185 --> 00:44:06,405
<i>♫ We promised ♫</i>

533
00:44:06,981 --> 00:44:12,677
<i>♫ To never be apart ♫</i>

534
00:44:13,413 --> 00:44:19,115
<i>♫ Do you want to hear me sing ♫</i>

535
00:44:19,115 --> 00:44:23,877
<i>♫ The wind chime swaying in my heart ♫</i>

536
00:44:24,421 --> 00:44:28,645
<i>♫ Is a wish ♫</i>

537
00:44:29,381 --> 00:44:35,269
<i>♫ I secretly made for you ♫</i>

538
00:44:35,813 --> 00:44:41,349
<i>♫ I want to plant ♫</i>

539
00:44:41,349 --> 00:44:43,237
<i>♫ A red maple forest ♫</i>

540
00:44:43,237 --> 00:44:47,845
<i>♫ To dye the whole mountain red ♫</i>

541
00:44:48,773 --> 00:44:51,013
<i>♫ The sky after the rain ♫</i>

542
00:44:51,653 --> 00:44:56,581
<i>♫ Was painted by our brilliant dreams ♫</i>

543
00:45:03,461 --> 00:45:08,229
<i>♫ Time is a flower of dream ♫</i>

544
00:45:09,061 --> 00:45:14,147
<i>♫ You've already collected it ♫</i>

545
00:45:15,077 --> 00:45:19,077
<i>♫ When we all become better ♫</i>

546
00:45:20,549 --> 00:45:24,677
<i>♫ We'll see the best of the world together ♫</i>
