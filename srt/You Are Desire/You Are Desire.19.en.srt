00:01:36,032 --> 00:01:37,824
<i>The result is not good. He needs you now.</i>

21
00:01:37,824 --> 00:01:39,872
You two wait here for me.
I'm going in to see Juan.

22
00:01:39,872 --> 00:01:41,879
Alright, call us if you need anything.

23
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,479
I didn't realize how small the bullseye was

24
00:02:20,479 --> 00:02:21,919
until I saw this target for the first time.

25
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:24,439
Outsiders can't even see the bullseye clearly,

26
00:02:24,439 --> 00:02:25,719
let alone shoot at it.

27
00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:28,919
Do shooters have the magic of sight?

28
00:02:36,199 --> 00:02:37,759
Why don't you ask me about the result?

29
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:48,400
If Rong Huai shot as fast

30
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,840
as he passing on a message,

31
00:02:50,919 --> 00:02:52,439
he would have been in our rapid-fire group.

32
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:56,080
I'm not as vulnerable as you think.

33
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,424
And

34
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,560
Coach Lei gave me a chance to try out.

35
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,656
If you don't practice for a day,
you'll know it.

36
00:03:06,656 --> 00:03:08,159
If you don't practice for three days,
the audience will know.

37
00:03:08,919 --> 00:03:11,059
After all, you've been away
from the range for four years.

38
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,400
No matter how talented you were
or how good your results achieved,

39
00:03:15,479 --> 00:03:18,120
you've been left behind
by those who've been striving hard until now.

40
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:22,879
I know it's hard to make up for what I've lost.

41
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,240
But I want to try again.

42
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I will make up for what I've lost

43
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,479
over the four years

44
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,599
by practicing harder.

45
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:46,080
There's a shooting test in two weeks.

46
00:03:47,719 --> 00:03:48,896
If you really want to come back,

47
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,400
prove yourself with good results
and come back with dignity.

48
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:54,280
After all, Coach Xu had high hopes
for you back then.

49
00:03:58,319 --> 00:03:59,424
Coach Xu…

50
00:04:01,719 --> 00:04:02,816
Is he okay?

51
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:05,920
Coach Xu retired.

52
00:04:06,919 --> 00:04:08,360
You can visit him after you get good results.

53
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,184
How did it go?

54
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,639
You did it?

55
00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:32,000
I knew Juan could do it.

56
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,319
Let's eat hot pot to celebrate it.

57
00:04:33,319 --> 00:04:34,519
It's not confirmed yet.

58
00:04:34,519 --> 00:04:36,680
Coach Lei only gave me a chance to try out.

59
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,040
We do things one step at a time.

60
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:41,160
Let's have a small meal today
to celebrate your tryout.

61
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:43,240
When you officially join the team,
we'll have a big feast.

62
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,320
That's right.

63
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,720
Well said, Lin Yujing.

64
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,240
You could say such pleasant things.

65
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:51,296
- Let's go.
- Come on.

66
00:04:51,296 --> 00:04:52,384
Let's go.

67
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:56,720
It's a two-week trial.

68
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,680
The physical training is needed.

69
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:01,696
It won't be easy to return

70
00:05:01,696 --> 00:05:03,168
to my original shooting level.

71
00:05:03,168 --> 00:05:05,839
You probably won't have time for classes.

72
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,519
If you're trained physically,
you'll need to eat well.

73
00:05:11,439 --> 00:05:12,512
What's the matter?

74
00:05:12,512 --> 00:05:13,696
Send me your class schedule.

75
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,759
Why?

76
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:17,728
During this period,
you just focus on the training.

77
00:05:17,728 --> 00:05:19,160
Leave the rest to me.

78
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:21,079
I guarantee
you'll keep your health and study well.

79
00:05:37,319 --> 00:05:38,368
Come in.

80
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,079
Mr. Fu.

81
00:05:44,079 --> 00:05:45,088
Are you looking for me?

82
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,319
The finance department said

83
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:50,720
they're short-handed at the end of the month

84
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,279
and need help with the invoice reimbursement.

85
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:55,079
You report to Mr. Huang
at the finance department.

86
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:04,959
Any problem?

87
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:06,304
Mr. Fu.

88
00:06:06,304 --> 00:06:08,040
Based on previous lessons,

89
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,376
I want to ask

90
00:06:09,376 --> 00:06:11,552
if you have any special instructions

91
00:06:11,552 --> 00:06:12,959
for this job.

92
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:16,839
Do I need to instruct you on such a simple job?

93
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,920
Alright, got it.

94
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:30,816
Come in.

95
00:06:33,879 --> 00:06:35,920
Mr. Huang, Mr. Fu sent me to help.

96
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,680
So you're Gu Xia?

97
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,352
I've been expecting you.

98
00:06:40,352 --> 00:06:44,199
Sort these invoices and stick them properly.

99
00:06:44,199 --> 00:06:45,839
Then enter them into the system.

100
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:47,680
Link them to the relevant people
who are getting reimbursed.

101
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,720
Can you finish it before you leave work?

102
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:52,360
I'll try my best.

103
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,920
Don't underestimate this job.

104
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:54,920
These invoices

105
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:58,800
record the company's operational expenses.

106
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,079
It's very important.

107
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,240
I've heard

108
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:06,432
you're the most clever among the new interns.

109
00:07:06,432 --> 00:07:08,600
So, I'm giving you this task.

110
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,439
I hope you can complete it.

111
00:07:10,439 --> 00:07:11,456
Okay, you may do it now.

112
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,920
I'm off.

113
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,920
And you? What are you eating for dinner?

114
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,736
It's done now.
You guys can go downstairs first.

115
00:08:04,736 --> 00:08:06,112
We'll wait for you outside.

116
00:08:06,112 --> 00:08:07,839
Okay, I'll be right there.

117
00:08:07,839 --> 00:08:09,056
How's that case going?

118
00:08:09,056 --> 00:08:10,199
Almost done.

119
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:11,744
But I still need your help.

120
00:08:11,744 --> 00:08:12,800
Alright.

121
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,432
Come in.

122
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,672
Mr. Huang.

123
00:08:36,672 --> 00:08:39,000
The reimbursement amount
and the invoices for Mr. Chen don't match up.

124
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:41,759
These invoices all come
from the same restaurant.

125
00:08:41,759 --> 00:08:42,840
Is that a problem?

126
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,240
You're quite careful.

127
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:47,392
Since you found the problem,

128
00:08:47,392 --> 00:08:49,720
you should report it in the system.

129
00:08:50,759 --> 00:08:53,440
- Okay.
- You may go.

130
00:09:07,039 --> 00:09:08,279
I'm back.

131
00:09:10,519 --> 00:09:12,759
I brought you something delicious.

132
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:17,720
Late-night barbecue, a foodie's favorite.

133
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,200
Let's eat.

134
00:09:25,679 --> 00:09:27,279
Come on. Spit it out.

135
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:28,919
You didn't want to intern before.

136
00:09:28,919 --> 00:09:30,120
Why are you so cheerful today?

137
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:31,879
Don't tell me my prediction was right.

138
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:34,360
Your boss fell in love with you?

139
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:35,440
Please.

140
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,720
Don't make me sick.

141
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,272
No gossip, and eat your food.

142
00:09:38,272 --> 00:09:39,759
Tell us what happened.

143
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,639
You really want to know?

144
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:47,080
Alright, I'll tell you.

145
00:09:47,679 --> 00:09:50,080
While I was doing reimbursements,

146
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,384
I found non-compliant invoices

147
00:09:52,384 --> 00:09:53,720
from bad workers.

148
00:09:54,279 --> 00:09:56,240
I saved the company a large sum of expenses.

149
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,440
The finance director praised me.

150
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:00,720
I believe in your business skills.

151
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,368
You have adapted to the workplace.

152
00:10:02,368 --> 00:10:04,240
You're not going to be a rookie anymore.

153
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,200
I never go wrong at a critical moment.

154
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,080
What are you busy with?

155
00:10:12,679 --> 00:10:13,919
I'm choosing courses.

156
00:10:13,919 --> 00:10:15,679
Shen Juan will join a training.

157
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:17,879
I want to attend his physics class

158
00:10:17,879 --> 00:10:18,976
to take notes for him.

159
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,200
If so, what about your own courses?

160
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,399
Look.

161
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:29,339
International Finance, Econometrics,
and Microeconomics.

162
00:10:29,339 --> 00:10:30,480
They all conflict with his classes.

163
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,840
I know, but I'll prioritize his classes first.

164
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,360
Anyway, I can make up for my missed lessons.

165
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,519
Lin Yujing.

166
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:38,120
You're drunk with love now.

167
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,759
She's love-struck.

168
00:10:39,759 --> 00:10:41,679
She's practically a dutiful lover.

169
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:45,000
But if you're going to attend his class,
you need his phone.

170
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,159
I'll ask him for it tomorrow.

171
00:10:49,159 --> 00:10:51,080
I have to warn you.

172
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:54,480
Boys have a lot of secrets in their phones.

173
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,759
Are you sure he'll give it to you?

174
00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:58,304
Good question.

175
00:11:02,559 --> 00:11:04,039
Sir, one soy milk and rice ball.

176
00:11:04,039 --> 00:11:05,120
Okay.

177
00:11:05,759 --> 00:11:07,232
Sir, two fried dough sticks.

178
00:11:07,232 --> 00:11:08,960
- Okay, thank you.
- See you.

179
00:11:10,639 --> 00:11:11,680
Wait a moment.

180
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:17,720
Why are you so early today?

181
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,519
Today is your first day of training.

182
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:23,264
I have to come and supervise you.

183
00:11:23,799 --> 00:11:24,919
And another thing,

184
00:11:24,919 --> 00:11:27,488
I need to confiscate your phone

185
00:11:27,488 --> 00:11:28,576
to avoid outside distractions.

186
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,559
You need to tell me the password.

187
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:40,960
- Password--
- I get it.

188
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:44,320
Boys all have some secrets.

189
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,440
I understand.
I'll give you half an hour to delete stuff.

190
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,616
0927.

191
00:11:47,616 --> 00:11:49,679
Welcome you to check my phone.

192
00:11:50,879 --> 00:11:53,679
0927, what day is that?

193
00:12:06,799 --> 00:12:08,039
You remembered?

194
00:12:08,039 --> 00:12:09,639
I'm not checking your phone.

195
00:12:09,639 --> 00:12:11,279
I need your phone to attend your class.

196
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:13,080
So, your training won't affect your attendance.

197
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,879
Thank you.

198
00:12:17,879 --> 00:12:19,008
Miss Lin.

199
00:12:19,679 --> 00:12:21,000
Not at all.

200
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,159
Good luck with your training.

201
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:23,320
I'm leaving.

202
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,248
That seat is taken.

203
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,320
It's you.

204
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,519
Well,

205
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,399
A change of major for love?

206
00:12:50,624 --> 00:12:51,639
No.

207
00:12:51,639 --> 00:12:53,240
Shen Juan is busy training.

208
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,336
I'm here for his attendance.

209
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:56,576
Attendance?

210
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:59,552
Didn't Shen Juan already report
to his department?

211
00:12:59,552 --> 00:13:01,399
He said he would be trained during this time.

212
00:13:01,399 --> 00:13:02,639
So, he couldn't guarantee his attendance.

213
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,519
No need to worry about his attendance.

214
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,000
<i>I need your phone to attend your class.</i>

215
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,559
<i>So, your training won't affect your attendance.</i>

216
00:14:37,679 --> 00:14:40,799
One, two, three, four.

217
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:44,000
Their physical condition
and endurance are good.

218
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,168
Coach.

219
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,240
Shen Juan, you stay.

220
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,679
You haven't passed the physical test yet.

221
00:14:54,679 --> 00:14:55,840
You're not qualified for live ammunition.

222
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,799
Let me introduce Coach Yu to you.

223
00:15:05,799 --> 00:15:07,360
He is our physical training coach.

224
00:15:07,879 --> 00:15:10,440
I specifically called him over
to conduct a functional movement test for you.

225
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:15,840
Hello, Coach Yu.

226
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:17,559
Show Coach Yu your foundation.

227
00:15:17,559 --> 00:15:20,120
One set of plank position,
and one set of elbow alternation.

228
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,176
Okay.

229
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:24,320
Go.

230
00:15:42,159 --> 00:15:44,320
Planking, two minutes thirty-three seconds.

231
00:15:57,399 --> 00:15:59,159
Elbow alternation, twenty-two times.

232
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,879
Coach Yu, what do you think?

233
00:16:07,879 --> 00:16:08,919
His physical fitness is okay.

234
00:16:10,039 --> 00:16:12,096
His core stability is also okay.

235
00:16:12,096 --> 00:16:13,399
But there's one thing,

236
00:16:13,399 --> 00:16:14,679
His shoulder flexibility

237
00:16:14,679 --> 00:16:16,720
and support stability are much worse.

238
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,392
Shen Juan.

239
00:16:20,159 --> 00:16:23,919
Your shoulder flexibility
and body stability are very poor.

240
00:16:23,919 --> 00:16:24,919
Coach Yu advised you to give up.

241
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,120
When did I say that?

242
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,840
Are you giving up?

243
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:33,159
You have two weeks.

244
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:34,240
If you want to be improved,

245
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,840
you'll be on the training ground
all the time except for sleeping.

246
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:37,888
Can you do it?

247
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:39,648
Yes.

248
00:16:39,648 --> 00:16:40,704
Louder.

249
00:16:40,704 --> 00:16:41,728
Yes!

250
00:16:47,679 --> 00:16:48,679
Coach Yu.

251
00:16:48,679 --> 00:16:50,519
Please help him improve as soon as possible.

252
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,888
14 hours a day.

253
00:16:57,888 --> 00:16:59,264
He must return to his best physical condition

254
00:16:59,264 --> 00:17:00,799
in the shortest time.

255
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,240
I advise you to give up.

256
00:17:08,039 --> 00:17:09,759
Let's not waste each other's time.

257
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:13,759
I won't give up.

258
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:17,079
Absolutely not.

259
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:24,832
Coach Lei.

260
00:17:24,832 --> 00:17:26,240
You are quite harsh.

261
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:28,920
Can he stand it?

262
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:29,920
It's okay.

263
00:17:32,519 --> 00:17:33,568
He can do it.

264
00:18:11,759 --> 00:18:12,799
Shen Juan, water.

265
00:18:15,599 --> 00:18:16,759
Lin Yujing just came over.

266
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,232
Your phone.

267
00:18:24,599 --> 00:18:25,696
Thank you.

268
00:18:49,079 --> 00:18:50,920
You look quite handsome when you're serious.

269
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:53,279
Go for it, my boyfriend.

270
00:19:30,119 --> 00:19:31,296
Mr. Chen?

271
00:19:33,319 --> 00:19:34,336
Gu Xia, right?

272
00:19:37,559 --> 00:19:39,839
You rejected my reimbursement invoices?

273
00:19:45,079 --> 00:19:46,400
Actually, it is a misunderstanding.

274
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:49,279
When we do business and negotiate with clients,

275
00:19:49,279 --> 00:19:51,400
we may pay without invoices.

276
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,599
Sometimes when I buy a gift

277
00:19:52,599 --> 00:19:54,240
for a client,

278
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,920
I will forget to ask for the invoice.

279
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,720
So I have to find a substitute

280
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:58,848
to get reimbursement.

281
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:03,160
But it is stated in the company regulations

282
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:05,119
that the reimbursement amount
must match the details.

283
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,559
Gu Xia.

284
00:20:09,559 --> 00:20:10,839
You're a new here, right?

285
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,920
Our law firm operates this way.

286
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:19,359
If it's within the stipulated amount limit,

287
00:20:19,359 --> 00:20:21,519
it's no problem
to offset accounts with regular invoices.

288
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:25,880
It's okay.

289
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:27,880
I don't blame you for this.

290
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:30,640
You revoke the reimbursement record

291
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,096
and re-submit it.

292
00:20:38,599 --> 00:20:40,400
Or should I ask Mr. Huang

293
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,559
for his advice?

294
00:20:43,279 --> 00:20:45,240
After all, I'm new. There are many rules--

295
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:47,480
I've already notified the finance department.

296
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:50,752
The record must be modified by the submitter.

297
00:20:50,752 --> 00:20:54,799
No need to make a big deal out of this.

298
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:55,872
Come on.

299
00:21:15,559 --> 00:21:18,000
Today is not your shift day.
What are you doing here?

300
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:21,536
I called her here.

301
00:21:21,536 --> 00:21:22,559
I'm asking her

302
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:23,680
a favor.

303
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:26,920
Mr. Chen, I don't get it.

304
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,279
When you have a problem,

305
00:21:29,279 --> 00:21:31,360
you don't ask your senior assistant

306
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,519
but a freshman

307
00:21:32,519 --> 00:21:33,799
to help you.

308
00:21:36,279 --> 00:21:37,440
I have an idea.

309
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:40,000
If you really don't have enough manpower,

310
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:42,000
I can apply for another assistant

311
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,448
for you at the next all-staff meeting.

312
00:21:46,839 --> 00:21:48,680
But she works for me now.

313
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:49,960
Mr. Chen.

314
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:51,680
If you want her help,

315
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:52,839
please ask my permission first.

316
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:03,839
Why are you still sitting here?
Go back to class.

317
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,360
I'm leaving.

318
00:22:20,119 --> 00:22:21,216
Please come in.

319
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:26,880
Mr. Fu.

320
00:22:27,599 --> 00:22:28,880
Thank you so much.

321
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:30,976
Not at all.

322
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,440
You could spot the invoice problem

323
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:37,839
and timely reported it
according to the regulations.

324
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:39,744
That's your basic quality

325
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:41,960
of a legal professional.

326
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,640
But you don't know the rules of the workplace

327
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,519
and act recklessly.

328
00:22:47,519 --> 00:22:48,599
It is a taboo.

329
00:22:55,279 --> 00:22:57,119
In fact, the workplace is like the classroom.

330
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:00,559
They both have their specific rules
and regulations.

331
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:04,720
You are now just a freshman.

332
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:08,079
You might not even understand your school work.

333
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,880
Why must you enter the workplace now?

334
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,359
If I were you,

335
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:28,160
I would spend more time on my study

336
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:29,319
to master legal knowledge.

337
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:34,920
Only by making yourself a determined person

338
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,279
can you face reality

339
00:23:37,279 --> 00:23:39,000
without being frustrated by setbacks.

340
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:45,952
Okay.

341
00:23:46,599 --> 00:23:47,680
I get it.

342
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:49,880
I will seriously consider it.

343
00:23:54,359 --> 00:23:57,000
You may leave, and leave the rest to me.

344
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:59,168
Thank you.

345
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,240
<i>Special action team for Shen Juan.</i>

346
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,960
<i>Show up, everyone.</i>

347
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:13,319
<i>I'm here.</i>

348
00:24:13,319 --> 00:24:14,440
<i>I'm here.</i>

349
00:24:21,559 --> 00:24:22,624
<i>Ten days to go.</i>

350
00:24:38,359 --> 00:24:39,456
<i>Supplies have been delivered.</i>

351
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:52,064
<i>Thank you.</i>

352
00:24:52,064 --> 00:24:53,376
<i>Juan, come on.</i>

353
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,248
<i>Nine days to go.</i>

354
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:29,440
<i>Sweetheart, my love supply has been delivered.</i>

355
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:30,880
<i>Can you be more restrained?</i>

356
00:25:35,018 --> 00:25:39,040
<i>[Go for it, Juan.]</i>

357
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:45,056
<i>Let's keep a low profile, Lin Yujing.</i>

358
00:25:45,056 --> 00:25:46,680
<i>Wang Yiyang, shut up.</i>

359
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:55,200
<i>Three days to go.</i>

360
00:26:06,039 --> 00:26:07,104
<i>Two days to go.</i>

361
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:16,352
<i>One day to go.</i>

362
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,559
<i>Juan, see you tomorrow.</i>

363
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:27,640
<i>Isn't it the day after tomorrow?</i>

364
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,440
<i>Wang Yiyang, can you do math?</i>

365
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:31,640
<i>It's been ten days.</i>

366
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:32,768
<i>Thank you all.</i>

367
00:27:10,279 --> 00:27:12,160
I guess you guys
have never watched a rapid fire match.

368
00:27:14,039 --> 00:27:15,680
How about I give you a brief explanation?

369
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:16,800
Alright, sounds good.

370
00:27:21,196 --> 00:27:23,799
<i>[Resting Room]</i>

371
00:27:23,799 --> 00:27:24,864
Shen Juan.

372
00:27:26,119 --> 00:27:27,136
Juan.

373
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:46,279
- Go on.
- Men's rapid fire

374
00:27:46,279 --> 00:27:47,400
requires athletes

375
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:49,519
to fire five shots continuously
in eight seconds,

376
00:27:49,519 --> 00:27:50,599
six seconds, and four seconds.

377
00:27:51,119 --> 00:27:52,960
Each shot must be within 9.7-point ring

378
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,000
to count as one point.

379
00:27:59,799 --> 00:28:02,680
Do you know what the 9.7-point ring mean?

380
00:28:03,519 --> 00:28:04,720
I don't know.

381
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:07,189
With the target as the center,

382
00:28:07,189 --> 00:28:09,240
it's a small circle with a diameter
of less than five millimeters.

383
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:14,000
The One Yuan coin we currently use

384
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
has a diameter

385
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,680
of 25 millimeters.

386
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:19,392
Roughly, one-fifth of the size of a coin.

387
00:28:20,079 --> 00:28:21,184
Like this big.

388
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:24,119
Looking at the target from 25 meters away is

389
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:25,680
like looking at a small black dot.

390
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:29,568
It's extremely difficult
and requires extreme shooting precision.

391
00:28:29,568 --> 00:28:32,400
I knew it was hard,
but I didn't expect it to be so difficult.

392
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,640
It's so exciting.

393
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:34,799
Is it?

394
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:35,920
This is not exciting yet.

395
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:37,640
Compared to other shooting competitions,

396
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:38,880
the more exciting thing about rapid fire is,

397
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,640
from the second round,

398
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:41,759
the players on the field

399
00:28:41,759 --> 00:28:43,040
will be eliminated from the last place.

400
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:45,160
One small mistake

401
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:46,920
can cause a top player
to be eliminated in an instant.

402
00:28:48,319 --> 00:28:50,519
There's no chance of catching up and making up.

403
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,559
Come on, the game starts.

404
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:03,584
Coach.

405
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:05,640
I think this is unfair.

406
00:29:07,119 --> 00:29:08,239
When two players shoot alternately,

407
00:29:08,239 --> 00:29:10,240
it can exert a pressure on each other.

408
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:12,640
Players at positions A, B, E,
and F are in pairs.

409
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:15,039
Only the player at position C is alone.

410
00:29:15,599 --> 00:29:18,480
I think this is unfair
to the other four trainees.

411
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:23,104
Shen Juan didn't
deliberately stand at position C.

412
00:29:23,104 --> 00:29:24,200
The position D is unoccupied.

413
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:25,472
What's unfair about that?

414
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,000
Coach,

415
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,079
I apply to go to position D.

416
00:29:34,279 --> 00:29:35,759
I can be the substitute.

417
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:41,952
Go ahead.

418
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:43,584
Thank you, coach.

419
00:29:50,519 --> 00:29:52,400
Who is he?

420
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:53,640
Captain Ning Yuan.

421
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:55,680
He is the strongest in the rapid fire team.

422
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:57,799
If he stands next to Shen Juan,

423
00:29:57,799 --> 00:29:59,839
it will put pressure
and interference on Shen Juan.

424
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:04,119
Shen Juan, don't worry.

425
00:30:04,759 --> 00:30:05,799
I will do my best

426
00:30:06,519 --> 00:30:07,920
to be a good interference man.

427
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:18,680
The game begins.

428
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:26,816
Ready.

429
00:30:39,599 --> 00:30:41,000
Good, four points.

430
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,368
Ready.

431
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:59,000
Position D, five points.

432
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:03,759
Position E, two points.

433
00:31:07,079 --> 00:31:08,519
Position F, one point.

434
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,640
He's safe for the first round.

435
00:31:15,119 --> 00:31:17,160
Congratulations to the player E
for achieving fifth place.

436
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:21,160
The second round now begins.

437
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:22,208
Ready.

438
00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:32,880
Position C, three points.

439
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,056
Ready.

440
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:44,920
Position D, four points.

441
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:50,720
Position F, four points.

442
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:59,680
Congratulations to F and A

443
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:01,200
for achieving fourth and third place.

444
00:32:04,119 --> 00:32:06,119
Ning Yuan, you back off.

445
00:32:06,119 --> 00:32:07,279
Let the trial shooter go on.

446
00:32:08,279 --> 00:32:09,519
Now the final round begins.

447
00:32:19,119 --> 00:32:21,200
Shen Juan is still one point behind.

448
00:32:21,839 --> 00:32:23,200
He must hold steady in the next round.

449
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:26,720
Ready.

450
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:35,680
Position B, three points.

451
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:37,400
Now the pressure is back on Shen Juan.

452
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,720
He needs to hit all five shots
to eliminate the opponent.

453
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,104
Ready.

454
00:33:57,559 --> 00:33:59,519
Position C, five points.

455
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:02,400
He won. Five shots hit.

456
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:08,119
Juan is awesome.

457
00:34:08,119 --> 00:34:09,159
I knew he could do it.

458
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:11,440
The selection competition ends.

459
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:12,576
Shen Juan won.

460
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:14,800
Report to the shooting range tomorrow.

461
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:21,559
Juan.

462
00:34:23,519 --> 00:34:27,199
Juan.

463
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:28,512
Awesome.

464
00:34:55,719 --> 00:34:56,840
You turned it around.

465
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:57,840
What are your thoughts?

466
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:00,559
There's still a lot of room for improvement.

467
00:35:00,559 --> 00:35:02,320
I look forward to your next performance.

468
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:03,679
Rest assured.

469
00:35:03,679 --> 00:35:04,832
Keep it up.

470
00:35:06,119 --> 00:35:07,168
See you.

471
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,519
By the way, congratulations
on joining the shooting team.

472
00:35:13,679 --> 00:35:14,752
It was a narrow victory.

473
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:18,280
But without your persistence,

474
00:35:19,559 --> 00:35:20,719
I wouldn't have returned to the shooting team.

475
00:35:23,639 --> 00:35:25,679
You go ahead and boldly chase your dreams.

476
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:27,840
I'll definitely always be behind you.

477
00:35:34,159 --> 00:35:35,296
See you tomorrow.

478
00:35:59,719 --> 00:36:00,736
Thank you.

479
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:18,912
Please come in.

480
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:25,376
Mr. Fu.

481
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:28,440
I came to tell you one thing.

482
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:30,639
I just told Mr. Shen

483
00:36:30,639 --> 00:36:31,776
I decided to quit.

484
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:34,960
Thank you for your care

485
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:37,079
in my work.

486
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:38,784
I learned a lot.

487
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:49,440
You've been improved a lot
since your first day.

488
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:53,679
You still have a long way to go.

489
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:56,199
If you want,

490
00:36:56,199 --> 00:36:57,952
you can come back

491
00:36:57,952 --> 00:36:59,040
in your junior year.

492
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:05,960
Well, if I encounter problems

493
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:07,400
in my studies,

494
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:08,719
can I ask you for advice?

495
00:37:09,679 --> 00:37:10,760
You can say no.

496
00:37:11,559 --> 00:37:12,736
Of course you can.

497
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:20,199
Study hard.

498
00:37:20,199 --> 00:37:21,344
Call me if you need anything.

499
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:29,856
Mr. Fu.

500
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:31,960
You're actually quite cute.

501
00:37:32,599 --> 00:37:33,664
Thank you.

502
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:53,400
Shen Juan,
now that you've joined the shooting team,

503
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:55,719
you should live
in the dormitory like everyone else.

504
00:37:55,719 --> 00:37:56,768
Okay.

505
00:37:58,159 --> 00:37:59,168
Come on.

506
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:03,280
Starting today,

507
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:05,559
Shen Juan formally joins us
and gets trained with everyone.

508
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:07,456
Great.

509
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:12,256
Stop.

510
00:38:13,239 --> 00:38:15,280
We're doing a test today.

511
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:18,639
One minute of gun lifting,
five sets each, starting now.

512
00:38:18,639 --> 00:38:20,079
- Ready.
- Yes.

513
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:39,920
Okay. Time's up.

514
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:44,928
Ning Yuan.

515
00:38:45,519 --> 00:38:47,776
You lead everyone in live ammunition practice.

516
00:38:47,776 --> 00:38:48,920
Okay.

517
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:51,119
Shen Juan, stay and do it again.

518
00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:00,000
Captain, I can't believe this.

519
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,960
Our coach picked someone
who can't even pass the basics

520
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:03,639
to drag us down.

521
00:39:03,639 --> 00:39:07,320
I think our competition
next year will be even tougher.

522
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:10,039
Captain, I'll keep my mouth shut.

523
00:39:10,039 --> 00:39:11,104
Do your training.

524
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:18,039
Shen Juan.

525
00:39:18,039 --> 00:39:19,104
One more time.

526
00:39:20,039 --> 00:39:21,056
Yes.

527
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:34,000
Shoulders, steady.

528
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,008
Elbows.

529
00:39:35,639 --> 00:39:36,672
Right.

530
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:38,944
Hold it.

531
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,280
Good, you passed.

532
00:39:58,599 --> 00:40:00,480
Shen Juan has already passed the test.

533
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:01,960
Will you let him go on live ammo training?

534
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:03,760
He just passed the most basic test.

535
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:05,760
This is what he should have done.

536
00:40:06,519 --> 00:40:07,559
You know it.

537
00:40:08,199 --> 00:40:09,960
You're not worthy of touching a real gun yet.

538
00:40:14,599 --> 00:40:15,599
Here are five bullets.

539
00:40:16,719 --> 00:40:18,039
Whenever you can fire these five shots

540
00:40:18,039 --> 00:40:20,039
within four seconds,

541
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:21,760
come find me.

542
00:40:22,679 --> 00:40:24,239
If your skill is not up to standard by then,

543
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:26,119
you'll be lifting the gun here every day.

544
00:40:53,679 --> 00:40:54,719
Shen Juan

545
00:40:54,719 --> 00:40:56,320
has passed the test.

546
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:58,079
Why did you not let him
go on live ammo training?

547
00:40:59,159 --> 00:41:00,800
He can see it but not touch it.

548
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:02,880
The wolf in the wilderness.

549
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,280
The hungrier it gets,
the more resilient it becomes.

550
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:08,599
You're pulling this trick again.

551
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,039
The fire in his heart

552
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:14,880
hasn't been fully ignited yet.

553
00:42:14,679 --> 00:42:17,199
<i>Not everyone has the courage to start over.</i>

554
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:19,920
<i>It's not easy for him.</i>

555
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:22,280
<i>And what I have to do is</i>

556
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:23,960
<i>to believe in his decision,</i>

557
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:26,039
<i>hold his hand firmly,</i>

558
00:42:26,039 --> 00:42:27,400
<i>and be there for him.</i>

559
00:42:40,965 --> 00:42:45,509
<i>♫ Love sprouts in my palm ♫</i>

560
00:42:46,821 --> 00:42:50,661
<i>♫ Yet worried linger within my eyes ♫</i>

561
00:42:52,453 --> 00:42:57,029
<i>♫ Our story hasn't ended ♫</i>

562
00:42:57,957 --> 00:43:01,637
<i>♫ So where are we now ♫</i>

563
00:43:03,461 --> 00:43:09,125
<i>♫ I want to hug you so badly ♫</i>

564
00:43:09,125 --> 00:43:13,189
<i>♫ I want to become better with you ♫</i>

565
00:43:14,437 --> 00:43:19,301
<i>♫ The youth we shared ♫</i>

566
00:43:19,301 --> 00:43:25,349
<i>♫ Turned into a rainbow within my heart ♫</i>

567
00:43:25,861 --> 00:43:31,429
<i>♫ I really want to warm you ♫</i>

568
00:43:31,429 --> 00:43:33,317
<i>♫ I want to share with you ♫</i>

569
00:43:33,317 --> 00:43:37,989
<i>♫ The beauty of the world ♫</i>

570
00:43:38,873 --> 00:43:41,093
<i>♫ We promised ♫</i>

571
00:43:41,669 --> 00:43:47,365
<i>♫ To never be apart ♫</i>

572
00:43:48,101 --> 00:43:53,803
<i>♫ Do you want to hear me sing ♫</i>

573
00:43:53,803 --> 00:43:58,565
<i>♫ The wind chime swaying in my heart ♫</i>

574
00:43:59,109 --> 00:44:03,333
<i>♫ Is a wish ♫</i>

575
00:44:04,069 --> 00:44:09,957
<i>♫ I secretly made for you ♫</i>

576
00:44:10,501 --> 00:44:16,037
<i>♫ I want to plant ♫</i>

577
00:44:16,037 --> 00:44:17,925
<i>♫ A red maple forest ♫</i>

578
00:44:17,925 --> 00:44:22,533
<i>♫ To dye the whole mountain red ♫</i>

579
00:44:23,461 --> 00:44:25,701
<i>♫ The sky after the rain ♫</i>

580
00:44:26,341 --> 00:44:31,269
<i>♫ Was painted by our brilliant dreams ♫</i>

581
00:44:38,149 --> 00:44:42,917
<i>♫ Time is a flower of dream ♫</i>

582
00:44:43,749 --> 00:44:48,835
<i>♫ You've already collected it ♫</i>

583
00:44:49,765 --> 00:44:53,765
<i>♫ When we all become better ♫</i>

584
00:44:55,237 --> 00:44:59,365
<i>♫ We'll see the best of the world together ♫</i>
