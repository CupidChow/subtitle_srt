19
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:35,168
Good night.

20
00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:28,759
My uncle asked me to bring you some melon.

21
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:31,840
Thanks.

22
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:37,039
Alright, go to bed early.

23
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:46,879
Don't close the door yet.
I need to get something.

24
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:01,376
I still have some professional course materials
to prepare.

25
00:03:01,376 --> 00:03:04,360
I'll do it here, and I can keep you company.

26
00:03:05,639 --> 00:03:07,199
Can I borrow your headphones?

27
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,479
- Good morning, Uncle.
- You're up.

28
00:04:14,439 --> 00:04:15,776
Uncle,

29
00:04:15,776 --> 00:04:17,600
is there any shop in our village
where I can buy some rat poison?

30
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,879
I want to buy some.

31
00:04:19,879 --> 00:04:21,920
No need. There are no rats at home.

32
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:24,270
There was some noise
in Lin Yujing's room last night.

33
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:25,720
I'm afraid she won't sleep well.

34
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,399
Noise?

35
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:31,040
Probably insects.

36
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,192
It's okay.

37
00:04:32,192 --> 00:04:34,920
There was a rat on the road last night,
wasn't there?

38
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:35,920
You saw how scared she was.

39
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,368
I'd better buy some poison

40
00:04:38,368 --> 00:04:40,079
to make her sleep more peacefully.

41
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:42,800
How about this?

42
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,279
I have a good method.

43
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,439
Let me show you. Follow me.

44
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,680
Remember it?

45
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,568
Yeah.

46
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:04,319
You're not going to tell Lin Yujing that story,
are you?

47
00:05:04,319 --> 00:05:05,759
She'll never believe it.

48
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,959
You believed it back then.

49
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:10,399
I was only seven years old then.

50
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:14,199
Give it a try. What if she believes it?

51
00:05:15,959 --> 00:05:17,319
I think she would.

52
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:24,979
This bowl is not just any bowl.

53
00:05:24,979 --> 00:05:27,560
This is the offering bowl for the Rat Immortal.

54
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:29,839
- Offering bowl?
- Yeah.

55
00:05:30,439 --> 00:05:33,680
As long as you put this bowl at the door

56
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,800
and put some offerings in it every day,

57
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,600
like rice, sugar,

58
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,519
pickles, or whatever.

59
00:05:41,319 --> 00:05:42,519
Then,

60
00:05:42,519 --> 00:05:45,399
the Rat Immortal
will definitely not enter the room.

61
00:05:45,399 --> 00:05:48,800
Maybe, he'll even give you a flower.

62
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:54,120
Sir, I'm not a child anymore.

63
00:05:55,439 --> 00:05:56,480
She didn't buy it.

64
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:01,160
Seems Shen Juan knows you better.

65
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:04,879
Let me tell you. When I was a kid
and went back to the old house,

66
00:06:05,439 --> 00:06:06,600
I was afraid of rats too.

67
00:06:07,279 --> 00:06:09,824
Every night,
if there was even a little noise in the room,

68
00:06:09,824 --> 00:06:11,519
I would be so nervous that I couldn't sleep.

69
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:13,600
Then, to appease me,

70
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,736
my uncle quickly made this bowl out of wood

71
00:06:16,736 --> 00:06:18,279
and made up this story.

72
00:06:18,959 --> 00:06:21,519
People might believe the story,
but the rat doesn't understand it.

73
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:23,040
What if it still runs in?

74
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,399
That's easy.

75
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:26,496
Starting today,
every night before I go to sleep,

76
00:06:26,496 --> 00:06:29,319
I'll seal up all the food, right?

77
00:06:29,319 --> 00:06:31,360
If there's no food in our house,

78
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,160
the rat won't come, right? Simple.

79
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:36,000
So he knew what to do all along,

80
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,112
but he made up this story to tease you.

81
00:06:38,112 --> 00:06:40,864
He was a man full of whimsical ideas.

82
00:06:40,864 --> 00:06:42,079
He always tried to appease me.

83
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:44,920
The key is that Qinghe's method worked.

84
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,360
Shen Juan, tell me.

85
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,680
Didn't you stop being afraid of rats

86
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,279
after you heard his story?

87
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,696
Yes.

88
00:06:54,199 --> 00:06:55,480
It's just that Lin is too smart.

89
00:06:56,279 --> 00:06:57,319
So I'm the stupid one, right?

90
00:06:57,319 --> 00:06:58,600
I'm a bit smarter than you.

91
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,199
There's so much stuff.

92
00:07:05,839 --> 00:07:07,008
Yes.

93
00:07:07,008 --> 00:07:08,600
My uncle liked to create,

94
00:07:09,319 --> 00:07:12,096
and he'd accumulated a lot of stuff over time.

95
00:07:12,096 --> 00:07:14,240
And then he put all these things
together with my other uncle,

96
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,319
so that's how it is now.

97
00:07:16,839 --> 00:07:19,199
Then we can help your uncle tidy up.

98
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,056
Okay.

99
00:07:44,079 --> 00:07:45,184
What's this?

100
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,040
This is my uncle's diary.

101
00:08:04,839 --> 00:08:06,240
When he had an accident,

102
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,959
my other uncle rushed back to take care of us.

103
00:08:09,959 --> 00:08:11,519
He packed this up,

104
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:15,000
and it was brought here by mistake.

105
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,839
Luckily we came back,

106
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,600
or else we would never have found it.

107
00:08:48,159 --> 00:08:50,159
What's this? It's so cute.

108
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:52,120
This is a little monster.

109
00:08:52,679 --> 00:08:56,080
When I was a kid, it chased me in my dreams
for several days in a row.

110
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,600
It almost swallowed me alive.

111
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:00,039
So it's like a rat.

112
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:02,720
Your uncle turned your nightmare
into a cute little monster,

113
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,519
so you wouldn't be afraid anymore.

114
00:09:13,559 --> 00:09:14,799
At that time,

115
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,279
my mother had just passed away.

116
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:21,504
I had nightmares every night,

117
00:09:21,504 --> 00:09:23,240
waking up in fear.

118
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,679
My uncle

119
00:09:24,679 --> 00:09:27,360
drew my nightmares.

120
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:37,320
Actually, not just nightmares.

121
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,639
He would also draw my good dreams

122
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,840
and turn them into silver ornaments
to put in the cabinet.

123
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,400
This,

124
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:48,720
this,

125
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,200
this,

126
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,232
this,

127
00:09:51,232 --> 00:09:52,288
this

128
00:09:53,399 --> 00:09:54,840
and this.

129
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,519
This pen cap.

130
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:09,960
Is it the one I took from your store back then?

131
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:18,944
<i>[Juan's first championship commemoration]</i>

132
00:10:32,039 --> 00:10:33,159
It's getting late.

133
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,080
Let's hurry up and clean.

134
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:09,519
Alright. Stop tidying up.

135
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:10,519
Have some fruit.

136
00:11:11,639 --> 00:11:12,736
Lin.

137
00:11:13,759 --> 00:11:14,759
Thank you, sir.

138
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,376
This.

139
00:11:17,376 --> 00:11:18,639
Thank you, Uncle.

140
00:11:19,399 --> 00:11:21,519
Did you two clean up upstairs?

141
00:11:22,759 --> 00:11:23,872
Pretty much.

142
00:11:23,872 --> 00:11:26,200
You came here to rest

143
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:28,159
but ended up working.

144
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:31,904
To be honest, your uncle's craftsmanship

145
00:11:31,904 --> 00:11:33,440
was incomparable to most.

146
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:20,919
I was wrong before.
I didn't put myself in your shoes.

147
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:26,120
From now on, no matter what decisions you make,
I will support you.

148
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:29,919
Okay.

149
00:13:29,919 --> 00:13:31,488
The final proposal is coming soon.

150
00:13:31,488 --> 00:13:32,879
Success or failure depends on it.

151
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,960
For your uncle,

152
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:36,320
we will give it our all.

153
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:48,639
- They're here.
- Move aside.

154
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,559
Luckily, you haven't gone in yet.

155
00:13:50,559 --> 00:13:51,879
Have a bite now.

156
00:13:53,159 --> 00:13:54,480
I tried to stop him, but couldn't.

157
00:13:55,039 --> 00:13:56,544
This is called the Champion Pancake.

158
00:13:56,544 --> 00:13:59,840
The shop owner's son was a top scorer
in the college entrance exam and became famous.

159
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,216
It even made the pancake shop famous.

160
00:14:01,216 --> 00:14:03,264
Everyone wanted a piece of the good fortune.

161
00:14:03,264 --> 00:14:06,120
As a result,
those who ate it performed exceptionally well.

162
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:08,736
Have a bite now.
It can guarantee you'll come in first.

163
00:14:08,736 --> 00:14:10,879
Wang Yiyang, stop messing around.

164
00:14:10,879 --> 00:14:13,440
This is true. It's been tested by fans.

165
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,120
Number six, Lin Yujing.

166
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:21,759
Lin Yujing, good luck.

167
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:25,720
You bring it in.

168
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:44,120
Ladies and gentlemen, my name is Lin Yujing.

169
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:48,120
The theme of my exhibition is Daydreamer.

170
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:58,240
All the exhibits
are from the silverware artist, Luo Qinghe.

171
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,120
Let's begin.

172
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,159
This is the first exhibit.

173
00:15:05,159 --> 00:15:08,192
You said earlier
that he was a silverware artist,

174
00:15:08,192 --> 00:15:11,080
but this exhibit is clearly made of wood.

175
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,600
Yes, it's made of wood.

176
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:17,799
Because of the limited materials,
he could only carve wood.

177
00:15:17,799 --> 00:15:19,759
However, the carving technique
of this wooden bowl

178
00:15:19,759 --> 00:15:21,960
is consistent with his previous silver works.

179
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:28,480
Lady,

180
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,559
are you afraid of rats?

181
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,519
If you are,

182
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:39,808
then this wooden bowl might be your savior.

183
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:41,960
Here's the thing.

184
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:48,519
As you can see, it's not a silver ornament

185
00:15:48,519 --> 00:15:50,200
but a wooden bowl.

186
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,840
But I still want to share it first,

187
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:54,639
not only because its artistic style

188
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:57,440
is in line with the silver works
of Qinghe Silverware,

189
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,679
but also because it allowed me
to personally realize

190
00:15:59,679 --> 00:16:04,279
that keep your inner child alive
and life's your own fairy tale.

191
00:16:10,679 --> 00:16:13,600
To me, it can scare away rats

192
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,240
and let me receive flowers.

193
00:16:18,559 --> 00:16:20,440
The same goes for my boyfriend.

194
00:16:28,679 --> 00:16:30,080
His works

195
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:32,559
are like a treasure box
filled with countless memories

196
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:34,679
and whimsical ideas.

197
00:16:34,679 --> 00:16:37,399
They can turn nightmares into beautiful dreams,

198
00:16:37,399 --> 00:16:40,840
providing infinite comfort and imagination.

199
00:16:42,279 --> 00:16:44,600
His uncle lived a poor life,

200
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:47,080
but he always stuck to his original dream.

201
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,519
So today,

202
00:16:48,519 --> 00:16:50,464
I want to share this beautiful world he created

203
00:16:50,464 --> 00:16:51,639
with everyone.

204
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,312
Thank you.

205
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,359
All the contestants, please come in.

206
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:24,680
I declare

207
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:26,816
the winner of the competition is

208
00:17:26,816 --> 00:17:27,904
contestant number two.

209
00:17:30,119 --> 00:17:31,680
Thank you.

210
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,528
Thank you.

211
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:38,079
The groups in this competition
are very different in style,

212
00:17:38,079 --> 00:17:39,359
and all are excellent.

213
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:43,200
So we decided to add a special award.

214
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,960
The contestant who wins it

215
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:48,799
can exhibit in the small exhibition hall
of our School of Economics and Management.

216
00:17:49,519 --> 00:17:52,400
Contestant number six, Lin Yujing,
congratulations.

217
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:03,872
She's coming.

218
00:18:03,872 --> 00:18:04,896
How did it go?

219
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,559
I should have eaten the Champion Pancake.

220
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:11,839
Sorry, I didn't come in first.

221
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:17,568
It was just a joke. Don't take it seriously.

222
00:18:17,568 --> 00:18:20,279
Just now,
Juan and He Songnan both criticized me.

223
00:18:20,279 --> 00:18:21,856
Don't mind it.

224
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:24,000
I don't mind.

225
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,720
Because I didn't come in first,

226
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:29,312
but I won a special prize
and can still hold an exhibition.

227
00:18:29,312 --> 00:18:31,712
And the school journalism team said
they wanted to interview us

228
00:18:31,712 --> 00:18:32,960
and post it on the school's public account

229
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,784
to promote the reopening
of the silverware store.

230
00:18:34,784 --> 00:18:35,936
Really?

231
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:40,064
Don't get too excited too soon, you two.

232
00:18:40,064 --> 00:18:41,559
Decorating the exhibition hall
and the promotion won't be easy.

233
00:18:41,559 --> 00:18:43,559
There's a lot of work to do.

234
00:18:43,559 --> 00:18:47,328
Don't worry. We promise to fulfill our duty
and hold the exhibition smoothly.

235
00:19:08,319 --> 00:19:09,664
We finally got everything done.

236
00:19:09,664 --> 00:19:11,720
Just the final touch left for tomorrow.

237
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,632
Don't you have a class?
What are you doing here?

238
00:19:17,632 --> 00:19:18,752
I'm a bit worried,

239
00:19:18,752 --> 00:19:20,400
so I came to check the process again.

240
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,720
That's good. Shen Juan
is inside preparing for the interview tomorrow.

241
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:23,744
He can't help.

242
00:19:23,744 --> 00:19:25,728
We'll feel more at ease with your check.

243
00:19:25,728 --> 00:19:29,024
- Don't you have a lab class? Go.
- OK.

244
00:19:29,024 --> 00:19:30,176
Then I'll go back too.

245
00:19:30,176 --> 00:19:32,039
I have to edit some videos tonight

246
00:19:32,039 --> 00:19:34,079
and post a couple of videos to hype it up.

247
00:19:34,599 --> 00:19:35,936
- I'm leaving.
- Bye.

248
00:19:35,936 --> 00:19:36,960
Bye.

249
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,752
<i>[Go, Juan!]</i>

250
00:21:00,279 --> 00:21:01,519
What are you thinking about?

251
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,119
You've been staring at this page for so long.

252
00:21:07,519 --> 00:21:09,376
Isn't the interview tomorrow?

253
00:21:09,376 --> 00:21:11,119
I'm just reading my uncle's diary

254
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:12,960
to get some inspiration.

255
00:21:20,319 --> 00:21:21,319
This page

256
00:21:22,359 --> 00:21:23,960
is his last manuscript.

257
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:27,079
Unfortunately, it wasn't made.

258
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,920
I've seen this bracelet.

259
00:21:37,799 --> 00:21:39,279
It's in your storage room.

260
00:21:41,599 --> 00:21:43,960
Is it a gift prepared by your uncle for you?

261
00:21:44,519 --> 00:21:45,920
I'll go back now.

262
00:21:47,359 --> 00:21:48,519
Shen Juan.

263
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,184
This one.

264
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:13,536
<i>[Juan will win!]</i>

265
00:22:40,039 --> 00:22:41,088
<i>Juan,</i>

266
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,920
<i>congratulations on completing
another competition of your own.</i>

267
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:53,039
<i>I'm sure</i>

268
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:54,944
<i>you will achieve a good result</i>

269
00:22:56,359 --> 00:22:58,480
<i>because after all,
you have put in so much effort.</i>

270
00:23:47,079 --> 00:23:48,480
<i>Juan,</i>

271
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:51,839
<i>I'm sorry
for not giving you my full support previously.</i>

272
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:55,640
<i>I was so eager to let you inherit my craft</i>

273
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:59,079
<i>that I overlooked what you truly love.</i>

274
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:01,440
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

275
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:05,319
<i>But now it seems</i>

276
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:07,640
<i>your dedication</i>

277
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:12,279
<i>and the determination
you put into practicing shooting</i>

278
00:24:12,279 --> 00:24:13,799
<i>is exactly</i>

279
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,359
<i>what I used to have.</i>

280
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:19,279
<i>Juan,</i>

281
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,464
<i>you know what?</i>

282
00:24:23,759 --> 00:24:25,559
<i>The happiest thing</i>

283
00:24:25,559 --> 00:24:26,960
<i>in the world</i>

284
00:24:28,279 --> 00:24:29,839
<i>is to do what you want to do.</i>

285
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:32,720
<i>Go ahead.</i>

286
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,559
<i>Fully express your passion</i>

287
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:37,000
<i>and unleash your brilliance.</i>

288
00:24:38,599 --> 00:24:39,680
<i>Besides,</i>

289
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:43,039
<i>I will firmly stand behind you,</i>

290
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:45,319
<i>watching you,</i>

291
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:47,872
<i>supporting you</i>

292
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:49,960
<i>and accompanying you.</i>

293
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:52,839
<i>Keep going, Juan.</i>

294
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,960
<i>I hope</i>

295
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:20,279
<i>you stand on the award podium soon.</i>

296
00:25:23,359 --> 00:25:24,704
<i>Keep going.</i>

297
00:26:59,759 --> 00:27:00,960
<i>Juan,</i>

298
00:27:01,839 --> 00:27:03,279
<i>why did you come back?</i>

299
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:05,359
<i>I was going</i>

300
00:27:05,359 --> 00:27:06,680
<i>to give you a surprise.</i>

301
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:09,039
<i>Since you're back,</i>

302
00:27:10,359 --> 00:27:11,759
<i>let me give you a try first.</i>

303
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:17,184
<i>♫ When have I ever been myself ♫</i>

304
00:27:19,504 --> 00:27:24,160
<i>♫ Wait for me at the end of the daydream ♫</i>

305
00:27:24,768 --> 00:27:28,384
<i>♫ Who has wandered within it ♫</i>

306
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:35,168
<i>♫ Life holds fireworks ♫</i>

307
00:27:36,096 --> 00:27:38,321
<i>♫ You inspired me ♫</i>

308
00:28:10,119 --> 00:28:11,904
In the past,

309
00:28:11,904 --> 00:28:13,960
my uncle not only gave me company,

310
00:28:15,359 --> 00:28:17,839
but he also changed my perspective
on the world.

311
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:20,960
His works

312
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,440
are like a magic window.

313
00:28:23,759 --> 00:28:27,136
He let me understand that those dusty things

314
00:28:27,136 --> 00:28:30,720
could be brought back to light through methods.

315
00:28:31,839 --> 00:28:34,720
The difficulties
and setbacks encountered in life

316
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:39,920
can be overcome with an optimistic attitude.

317
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,519
Turning junk into magic.

318
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:46,319
So Mr. Luo Qinghe has a great influence on you.

319
00:28:46,319 --> 00:28:49,440
I just heard from your friend
that you planned to reopen the silver shop.

320
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:52,832
Has making silverware
gradually become your dream?

321
00:28:52,832 --> 00:28:55,440
The silver shop is the connection
between your two generations.

322
00:28:58,079 --> 00:28:59,136
I…

323
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:08,839
I was planning to reopen the silver shop.

324
00:29:10,119 --> 00:29:11,440
But it was not because that was my dream.

325
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:16,160
It was because that place carried
too many memories.

326
00:29:19,559 --> 00:29:21,279
I felt as long as I guarded the shop,

327
00:29:23,599 --> 00:29:24,768
I could keep

328
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:28,680
my uncle.

329
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,279
But now I've realized it.

330
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:40,759
It's right that memories matter.

331
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,104
But the most precious thing

332
00:29:43,104 --> 00:29:45,079
my uncle left me

333
00:29:45,079 --> 00:29:46,720
was the courage to pursue my dream.

334
00:29:48,599 --> 00:29:50,279
So from now on,

335
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,240
I'll pick up my dream again

336
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:55,680
and shine my light.

337
00:29:59,359 --> 00:30:00,480
Good.

338
00:30:03,359 --> 00:30:04,544
Good.

339
00:30:07,359 --> 00:30:08,559
Good.

340
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:09,632
Good.

341
00:30:37,559 --> 00:30:39,519
Let's do a simple cleanup today.

342
00:30:39,519 --> 00:30:41,312
Come back tomorrow morning to do it thoroughly.

343
00:30:41,312 --> 00:30:42,432
Alright.

344
00:30:48,839 --> 00:30:49,856
<i>Today I live streamed the exhibition</i>

345
00:30:49,856 --> 00:30:51,232
<i>and gained more than 200 followers.</i>

346
00:30:51,232 --> 00:30:52,704
<i>Some people were far away and couldn't come,</i>

347
00:30:52,704 --> 00:30:54,400
<i>so they messaged me privately
to ask for the exhibition handbook.</i>

348
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:58,400
<i>Is this a great success for us?</i>

349
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:00,096
<i>I don't know if it is a great success.</i>

350
00:31:00,096 --> 00:31:02,336
<i>But you're definitely in great excitement.</i>

351
00:31:02,336 --> 00:31:03,480
As the organizer of this exhibition,

352
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:06,160
have you really taken a good look at it?

353
00:31:09,319 --> 00:31:10,336
No.

354
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,559
So are you going to give me a personal tour?

355
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:16,800
Sure.

356
00:31:18,079 --> 00:31:19,104
Let's go.

357
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,504
I didn't expect

358
00:31:33,504 --> 00:31:35,039
this exhibition could really happen.

359
00:31:35,799 --> 00:31:37,279
It was like a dream.

360
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,160
Luckily you were there.

361
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:44,079
So this daydream

362
00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:46,359
could become reality,

363
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:53,480
and I could find my uncle's diary

364
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:56,960
and the bracelet he gave me

365
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,240
and understand his heart.

366
00:32:06,519 --> 00:32:07,680
It may sound arrogant

367
00:32:09,759 --> 00:32:11,680
if I say I'm going back to the game.

368
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,319
But I also know

369
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,136
I've wasted the golden time

370
00:32:19,136 --> 00:32:20,544
of being an athlete.

371
00:32:20,544 --> 00:32:22,319
I believe in you.

372
00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:25,880
After all,

373
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,559
you're my omnipotent Juan.

374
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:42,680
Before that,

375
00:32:43,359 --> 00:32:45,200
would you like to do me one last favor?

376
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:50,799
Close the silver shop

377
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,559
with me.

378
00:32:56,599 --> 00:32:57,759
Alright.

379
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:13,824
What's wrong?

380
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:16,599
I'm not quite ready to close it yet.

381
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:18,976
Back then, you guys locked this door

382
00:33:18,976 --> 00:33:20,279
and shut me in.

383
00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:23,359
Now two years have passed in a flash.

384
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:25,640
So many stories have happened here.

385
00:33:38,079 --> 00:33:39,160
In the future,

386
00:33:40,119 --> 00:33:41,799
there will be more stories between us.

387
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:50,592
Let's go.

388
00:34:14,559 --> 00:34:16,880
Mr. Nie, it has all been arranged for you.

389
00:34:48,679 --> 00:34:49,679
Uncle,

390
00:34:50,599 --> 00:34:52,320
the exhibition today was a great success.

391
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:55,440
If you were here,

392
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:58,800
you would be very happy.

393
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:18,080
Speed up.

394
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,552
Speed up.

395
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:28,832
I can't go on.

396
00:36:28,832 --> 00:36:30,784
This shuttle run
feels like a punishment every time.

397
00:36:30,784 --> 00:36:32,096
Who could stand this?

398
00:36:32,096 --> 00:36:33,440
You're giving up already?

399
00:36:34,039 --> 00:36:35,424
Look at our captain.

400
00:36:35,424 --> 00:36:37,199
He even runs two extra laps
on his own each time.

401
00:36:37,199 --> 00:36:38,400
This is what we call a gap.

402
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:42,400
I'll have water then run a couple more laps
to catch up with the captain.

403
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,280
You're really a role model.

404
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:48,639
- Captain.
- Captain, water.

405
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:50,688
Thanks.

406
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:53,344
Rest now.

407
00:36:53,344 --> 00:36:54,360
We'll do a hybrid cardio run later.

408
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:55,400
We're still going to run?

409
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:56,440
No problem, captain.

410
00:36:57,239 --> 00:36:58,496
Do you two have any problems?

411
00:36:58,496 --> 00:37:00,119
No problem.

412
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:06,239
My senior is back.

413
00:37:09,536 --> 00:37:11,584
Where are you going?
The training isn't over yet.

414
00:37:11,584 --> 00:37:13,119
I'll make up for it later
and run a couple more laps.

415
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:17,312
What are you standing there for?

416
00:37:17,312 --> 00:37:18,519
Continue.

417
00:37:18,519 --> 00:37:19,639
Alright, let's train.

418
00:37:19,639 --> 00:37:20,704
Let's go.

419
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:32,760
You want to join the school team?

420
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:37,599
I hate quitters the most.

421
00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:40,079
Besides, you've already given up once.

422
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:41,320
How can I believe

423
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:42,960
that you can stick to it this time?

424
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:46,280
I will prove it with my actions.

425
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:48,360
Please give me a chance.

426
00:38:00,679 --> 00:38:01,760
Whether you can join the team

427
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:03,000
is up to you.

428
00:38:27,079 --> 00:38:28,160
Shen Juan.

429
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,896
Why are you here instead of running
on the playground at this time?

430
00:38:32,896 --> 00:38:33,984
I…

431
00:38:34,719 --> 00:38:35,760
And you.

432
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:40,519
Why are you all here?

433
00:38:40,519 --> 00:38:41,600
Sir,

434
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:44,096
they all want to take a look
at the genius player

435
00:38:44,096 --> 00:38:45,119
from four years ago.

436
00:38:45,639 --> 00:38:46,920
Right.

437
00:38:47,639 --> 00:38:49,400
Alright, just do it.

438
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:50,688
All of you, look.

439
00:38:50,688 --> 00:38:52,000
And go back and run five laps later.

440
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:54,016
Do we still have to run?

441
00:38:54,016 --> 00:38:55,072
Yes, we will do it.

442
00:38:55,072 --> 00:38:56,128
Take a good look.

443
00:39:21,239 --> 00:39:22,599
Deng Limin, Chang Zhiqi,

444
00:39:23,199 --> 00:39:24,800
watch and learn.

445
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:25,824
Scram.

446
00:39:26,639 --> 00:39:28,000
It's about to start.

447
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:07,360
Ready.

448
00:40:26,519 --> 00:40:28,519
One hit. 9.7 ring shot.

449
00:40:28,519 --> 00:40:29,719
One point.

450
00:40:31,239 --> 00:40:33,400
That's it? Oh my goodness.

451
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:35,679
With this score,
he is called a genius marksman?

452
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:37,800
My five laps.

453
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:40,064
Where are you going, captain?

454
00:40:40,064 --> 00:40:42,039
Let's go, captain.

455
00:40:59,559 --> 00:41:01,559
<i>Shen Juan has finished his trial shooting.</i>

456
00:41:01,559 --> 00:41:03,239
<i>It's not good. You'd better come over.</i>

457
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:06,599
That's it for today's lesson.

458
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,528
Continue

459
00:41:10,528 --> 00:41:13,440
to complete the social survey

460
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:14,784
I assigned last week.

461
00:41:14,784 --> 00:41:16,840
Contact me if you have any questions.

462
00:41:18,971 --> 00:41:21,696
<i>[Pucheng University School of Finance]</i>

463
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:25,480
Why is it taking so long?

464
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:28,360
Wang Yiyang, He,

465
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:34,280
I just got a message from Rong Huai.
It seems like it's not good.

466
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:36,320
What do you mean by it's not good?

467
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,016
Juan lost?

468
00:41:38,016 --> 00:41:39,456
How is that possible?

469
00:41:39,456 --> 00:41:41,320
How could he possibly lose?

470
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:43,360
You two wait for me.
I'll go in and see what's going on.

471
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:45,360
Alright, call us if you need anything.

472
00:42:16,159 --> 00:42:17,216
<i>I may never be able to</i>

473
00:42:17,216 --> 00:42:18,480
<i>say goodbye to the past.</i>

474
00:42:19,239 --> 00:42:20,239
<i>But it doesn't matter.</i>

475
00:42:21,199 --> 00:42:23,872
<i>Forgetting is never the solution to a problem.</i>
