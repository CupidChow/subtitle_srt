You did well on the exam.

Thanks to me transferring you back.

23
00:02:41,472 --> 00:02:44,000
Fill out the official application form
as I did.

24
00:02:46,784 --> 00:02:48,896
I've already talked to your head teacher.

25
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:51,680
With your grades,
Peking University's Finance Department

26
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,120
is your best choice.

27
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,439
You did well.

28
00:03:15,488 --> 00:03:17,760
Have you decided to go abroad for college?

29
00:03:18,912 --> 00:03:20,120
Yes.

30
00:03:20,672 --> 00:03:23,328
Many say it's a wide world,

31
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:24,832
and that they'd like to go explore it.

32
00:03:24,832 --> 00:03:26,688
I don't want to be all talk

33
00:03:26,688 --> 00:03:27,759
and no deed.

00:03:28,768 --> 00:03:33,760
What do you think coffee tastes like
on the left bank of the Seine?

35
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,879
I'd like to try it too.

36
00:03:38,272 --> 00:03:40,759
If only I could be as carefree as you.

37
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:44,640
Are you bothered by the plethora

38
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,720
of schools and majors to choose from

39
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:47,879
because you did so well on the exam?

40
00:03:49,056 --> 00:03:51,680
My mom decides my school and my major for me.

41
00:03:57,344 --> 00:03:58,592
What do you think?

42
00:03:58,592 --> 00:04:00,064
Does what I think matter?

43
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:02,848
How can it not matter?

44
00:04:03,418 --> 00:04:04,512
Of course it does.

45
00:04:05,738 --> 00:04:07,200
I think

46
00:04:08,618 --> 00:04:11,616
you need to think about what you really like

47
00:04:12,539 --> 00:04:14,816
and what you really want to do in the future.

48
00:04:15,424 --> 00:04:18,784
Yes, your mom
will choose your major and school,

49
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,832
but she won't live your life

50
00:04:20,832 --> 00:04:22,179
for you.

51
00:04:27,458 --> 00:04:28,672
Come here.

52
00:04:34,499 --> 00:04:36,032
What are you going to do, Lin Yujing?

53
00:04:37,939 --> 00:04:39,520
Why not Peking University?

54
00:04:41,018 --> 00:04:43,232
I think the Finance Department
of Pucheng University suits me better.

55
00:04:43,232 --> 00:04:45,632
And Pucheng is the financial center.

56
00:04:45,632 --> 00:04:47,744
The teaching staff and student job prospects
are not inferior to Peking University.

57
00:04:48,338 --> 00:04:50,496
To put it bluntly,
you just want to go back to Pucheng.

58
00:04:50,496 --> 00:04:52,018
So you don't want to go to Peking University?

59
00:04:54,138 --> 00:04:55,584
Then you go study abroad.

60
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,216
Abroad.

61
00:04:57,216 --> 00:04:58,656
I'm an adult now.

62
00:04:58,656 --> 00:05:00,448
I can decide where to go to university.

63
00:05:00,448 --> 00:05:02,624
This is my decision,
and I'll take responsibility for it.

64
00:05:03,488 --> 00:05:04,544
You'll take responsibility?

65
00:05:04,544 --> 00:05:05,632
How do you do it?

66
00:05:05,632 --> 00:05:07,136
What're you going to do it with?

67
00:05:10,528 --> 00:05:12,128
Pucheng University is what I choose,

68
00:05:12,128 --> 00:05:13,472
and I won't change it.

69
00:05:36,288 --> 00:05:38,848
Sir, please go to Pucheng University.

70
00:05:49,504 --> 00:05:51,360
Are you a new student reporting?

71
00:05:52,098 --> 00:05:53,760
It's amazing

72
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:56,096
to get into Pucheng University, girl.

<i>Why aren't you surprised at all?</i>

86
00:07:49,568 --> 00:07:51,136
<i>So you knew she came back.</i>

87
00:07:51,776 --> 00:07:54,016
<i>I'm hanging up.
Someone needs me. Let's talk later.</i>

88
00:08:02,464 --> 00:08:04,640
Excuse me, where is the Finance Department?

89
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:06,752
Could you please tell me
where the Physics Department is?

90
00:08:06,752 --> 00:08:08,736
It is just ahead.

91
00:08:08,736 --> 00:08:10,592
Just keep going this way.

92
00:08:10,592 --> 00:08:11,808
Thank you.

93
00:08:29,379 --> 00:08:30,539
Excuse me,

94
00:08:30,539 --> 00:08:32,640
has a girl named Lin Yujing reported yet?

95
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:33,696
He has already reported.

96
00:08:33,696 --> 00:08:34,784
If you're looking for him,

97
00:08:34,784 --> 00:08:36,384
you can go directly to the Dormitory Building.

98
00:08:36,384 --> 00:08:38,496
Our college
has been assigned to zone one this year.

99
00:08:38,496 --> 00:08:39,744
May you succeed.

100
00:08:39,744 --> 00:08:40,999
Thank you.

101
00:08:40,999 --> 00:08:42,752
Lin Yujing has already registered.

102
00:08:42,752 --> 00:08:43,808
She just left.

103
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,098
Thank you.

104
00:08:48,098 --> 00:08:49,216
You're welcome.

00:09:03,179 --> 00:09:04,192

00:09:04,192 --> 00:09:05,248
It's okay.

00:09:06,528 --> 00:09:08,256
- Are you okay?
- Thank you.

108
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,520
Ma'am, could you please tell me

109
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:21,856
which dormitory building
the freshman Shen Juan live in?

110
00:09:21,856 --> 00:09:23,296
I'm his classmate.

111
00:09:23,296 --> 00:09:25,152
Let me check for you.

112
00:09:31,648 --> 00:09:34,016
The one you're looking for
is not in this building.

113
00:09:34,016 --> 00:09:35,968
You should go check other buildings.

114
00:09:36,819 --> 00:09:38,048
Thank you, ma'am.

115
00:10:16,672 --> 00:10:18,359
Shen Juan, why are you here?

116
00:10:18,359 --> 00:10:19,520
Hello.

117
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:21,959
A very pretty freshman came to register today,

118
00:10:21,959 --> 00:10:23,328
and she directly said your name.

119
00:10:23,328 --> 00:10:24,768
I guess she knows you.

120
00:10:24,768 --> 00:10:25,824
If I had known you were here,

121
00:10:25,824 --> 00:10:27,456
I would have brought her directly to you.

122
00:10:28,096 --> 00:10:29,344
Did she say where she wanted to go?

123
00:10:29,344 --> 00:10:31,456
I told her to go to the boys' dormitory
to find you.

124
00:10:31,456 --> 00:10:32,498
She's now probably…

125
00:10:32,498 --> 00:10:34,944
Shen Juan, it's raining so heavily.

126
00:10:34,944 --> 00:10:36,384
At least bring an umbrella.

127
00:10:37,179 --> 00:10:38,208
Thank you.

144
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:22,912
How did you do
in the college entrance examination?

145
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:32,256
I scored 721 points.

146
00:13:37,024 --> 00:13:38,218
So good.

147
00:13:42,419 --> 00:13:43,520
Lin Yujing,

148
00:13:45,312 --> 00:13:46,656
why did you choose
to come to Pucheng University?

149
00:13:47,939 --> 00:13:49,824
Because we made a promise

150
00:13:49,824 --> 00:13:51,200
to enter Pucheng University together.

151
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,439
What if I didn't keep my promise

152
00:13:52,439 --> 00:13:53,824
and I didn't come to Pucheng University?

153
00:13:55,584 --> 00:13:56,699
That's impossible.

154
00:13:56,699 --> 00:13:58,336
I was sure you would come.

155
00:14:01,258 --> 00:14:02,400
True.

156
00:14:04,498 --> 00:14:05,728
You know everything.

157
00:14:11,299 --> 00:14:12,352
Your floor.

158
00:14:20,512 --> 00:14:21,632
Lin Yujing,

159
00:14:27,618 --> 00:14:29,248
do you have anything else to say to me?

160
00:14:33,338 --> 00:14:34,592
This is for you.

161
00:14:49,696 --> 00:14:52,448
I will have a hot pot dinner

162
00:14:52,448 --> 00:14:53,792
with He Songnan and Xu Ruyi tonight.

163
00:14:55,872 --> 00:14:56,928
Well.

164
00:15:44,338 --> 00:15:45,504
Thank you.

165
00:15:48,699 --> 00:15:50,208
Why is it you?

166
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:52,960
That's too much of a coincidence.

167
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,432
This is not a coincidence.

168
00:15:54,432 --> 00:15:57,088
I saw your name on the freshman list,

169
00:15:57,088 --> 00:15:58,400
and I came here specially for you.

170
00:15:59,378 --> 00:16:00,768
So you really love me.

171
00:16:00,768 --> 00:16:02,272
Not very much.

172
00:16:02,272 --> 00:16:04,599
I just think
it's nice to have a familiar roommate.

173
00:16:04,599 --> 00:16:06,539
It's better than strangers, right?

174
00:16:07,424 --> 00:16:09,952
But you? You disappeared for more than a year.

175
00:16:09,952 --> 00:16:11,520
You acted so sad before you left

176
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:13,728
but then turned cold as ice
once you got to Huaicheng.

177
00:16:13,728 --> 00:16:15,648
Isn't this a destined reunion?

178
00:16:17,179 --> 00:16:18,688
My fault, okay?

179
00:16:18,688 --> 00:16:20,224
It is.

180
00:16:20,224 --> 00:16:22,560
Think about how you're going to make it up
to me in the next four years.

181
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,576
What do you want me to do, Miss?

182
00:16:26,368 --> 00:16:28,704
Start by helping me put on a quilt cover?

183
00:16:28,704 --> 00:16:29,824
Okay.

184
00:16:30,498 --> 00:16:32,160
You hold these two corners for me.

185
00:16:34,048 --> 00:16:35,776
What major are you studying now?

186
00:16:35,776 --> 00:16:37,024
Law.

187
00:16:37,024 --> 00:16:38,400
Did you change your WeChat?

188
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,320
No, it's still the same one.

189
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,728
Then I'll add you to the group later

190
00:16:41,728 --> 00:16:43,599
to introduce you to our dormitory rules.

191
00:16:43,599 --> 00:16:44,704
Okay.

192
00:16:44,704 --> 00:16:46,784
Usually, it's just you, me

193
00:16:46,784 --> 00:16:48,576
and Little Mushroom on that bed.

194
00:16:49,659 --> 00:16:51,456
That girl is a day student.

195
00:16:52,858 --> 00:16:56,800
Water, electricity
and internet fees are shared.

196
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,848
Paid once a month in turns.

197
00:16:58,848 --> 00:17:00,864
Got it.

198
00:17:02,578 --> 00:17:04,359
And the cleaning.

199
00:17:04,359 --> 00:17:05,536
Once a week.

200
00:17:05,536 --> 00:17:07,520
I swept it today. It's your turn next week.

201
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,544
Got it.

202
00:17:09,139 --> 00:17:10,464
What's wrong with you?

203
00:17:10,464 --> 00:17:13,664
Lin Yujing, what did Huaicheng do to you?

204
00:17:13,664 --> 00:17:15,008
Turning you from a sharp-tongued person

205
00:17:15,008 --> 00:17:17,056
into a parrot.

206
00:17:17,056 --> 00:17:19,299
I just see the situation clearly.

207
00:17:19,299 --> 00:17:20,539
How can this mouth of mine beat

208
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:22,144
the silver tongue of a law student?

209
00:17:24,379 --> 00:17:26,880
You guys in the Finance Department
are hypocritical, okay?

210
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,439
Just now you said what a destined reunion.

211
00:17:28,439 --> 00:17:29,824
It's all lies.

212
00:17:34,848 --> 00:17:36,512
It's been more than a year.

213
00:17:36,512 --> 00:17:37,792
How is everyone?

214
00:17:38,848 --> 00:17:41,088
Don't you know to ask?

215
00:17:41,088 --> 00:17:42,880
No one kicked you out of the chat group.

216
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,096
You could forget about us,

217
00:17:44,096 --> 00:17:45,696
but you even ignored Shen Juan.

218
00:17:46,208 --> 00:17:47,520
He also got into Pucheng University.

219
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,408
I wonder how you'll face him after this.

220
00:17:56,298 --> 00:18:00,000
Hello, everyone. I'm your counselor, Miss Chen.

221
00:18:00,512 --> 00:18:02,848
Welcome to Pucheng University.

222
00:18:02,848 --> 00:18:05,408
This will be a place
to set sail for your dreams.

223
00:18:05,408 --> 00:18:08,288
- Hope that you will…
- You are Shen Juan, right?

224
00:18:08,288 --> 00:18:10,659
I heard you scored 723 points.

225
00:18:10,659 --> 00:18:12,320
That's 723 points!

226
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,560
You could have gone to Tsinghua
or Peking University.

227
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:15,599
Why did you choose Pucheng University?

228
00:18:15,599 --> 00:18:17,559
Actively participate in group activities,

229
00:18:17,559 --> 00:18:19,139
care about your class
and have a sense of community.

230
00:18:19,139 --> 00:18:20,639
Pay attention in class.

231
00:18:20,639 --> 00:18:22,336
No whispering.

232
00:18:22,912 --> 00:18:25,248
I hope everyone follows these points.

233
00:18:29,379 --> 00:18:30,880
Such a cute bear.

234
00:18:32,058 --> 00:18:33,408
You must be Lin Yujing, right?

235
00:18:33,408 --> 00:18:34,720
I am Little Mushroom.

236
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,288
I'm from the computer science department.

237
00:18:36,288 --> 00:18:37,664
I'm from the Finance Department.

238
00:18:38,179 --> 00:18:39,579
- Welcome.
- Thank you.

239
00:18:41,139 --> 00:18:42,944
You carry this bear everywhere.

240
00:18:42,944 --> 00:18:43,968
Aren't you tired of it?

241
00:18:43,968 --> 00:18:44,992
No, I'm not tired.

242
00:18:44,992 --> 00:18:46,400
I can't sleep without it.

243
00:18:48,018 --> 00:18:49,920
What's with that expression?

244
00:18:51,328 --> 00:18:53,856
Sis, it's time for you to step up.

245
00:18:53,856 --> 00:18:55,360
Just vote for me.

246
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,864
I'll send you the link.

247
00:19:01,498 --> 00:19:02,592
Did you get it?

248
00:19:03,218 --> 00:19:05,920
Lin Yujing, you must look at this.

249
00:19:07,978 --> 00:19:09,536
Vote for the current number one.

250
00:19:09,536 --> 00:19:10,998
Shen Juan,
from the Physics Department of our university.

251
00:19:10,998 --> 00:19:12,288
Don't vote wrong.

252
00:19:12,288 --> 00:19:14,848
The handsome guy from our university
must take center stage.

253
00:19:14,848 --> 00:19:16,192
Let's strongly support him.

254
00:19:16,818 --> 00:19:19,168
You definitely won't vote wrong, right?

255
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,279
Oh, right.

256
00:19:23,279 --> 00:19:26,879
I heard you two were in the same school
as Shen Juan.

257
00:19:26,879 --> 00:19:28,320
Tell me now.

258
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:31,136
Was he a man who had a story

259
00:19:31,136 --> 00:19:32,960
as the legend had it?

260
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,144
Legend?

261
00:19:35,834 --> 00:19:38,055
I heard

262
00:19:38,055 --> 00:19:39,954
he used to be a tough guy at school

263
00:19:39,954 --> 00:19:42,400
and even had a straight-A ex-girlfriend.

264
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:45,235
However, she transferred schools
in the second semester of high school.

265
00:19:46,394 --> 00:19:48,955
Then Shen Juan was heartbroken.

266
00:19:48,955 --> 00:19:51,375
Since then, he has been working hard.

267
00:19:51,375 --> 00:19:53,375
Where did you hear all this?

268
00:19:53,375 --> 00:19:55,456
From the freshman gossip group.

269
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,275
Oh, right, I also heard

270
00:19:58,275 --> 00:19:59,574
with Shen Juan's score,

271
00:19:59,574 --> 00:20:01,952
he could have entered Peking University
or Tsinghua University.

272
00:20:01,952 --> 00:20:03,894
But he's still angry with his ex-girlfriend,

273
00:20:03,894 --> 00:20:05,216
and he doesn't want to see her,

274
00:20:05,216 --> 00:20:06,752
so he came here.

275
00:20:09,834 --> 00:20:10,976
Ex-girlfriend,

276
00:20:10,976 --> 00:20:12,896
did you see your ex-boyfriend tonight?

277
00:20:13,634 --> 00:20:14,880
Is he still angry with you?

278
00:20:16,834 --> 00:20:18,755
You're Shen Juan's ex-girlfriend.

279
00:20:19,675 --> 00:20:21,255
No. Don't listen to her nonsense.

280
00:20:21,255 --> 00:20:22,594
We are just former deskmates.

281
00:20:23,795 --> 00:20:25,075
Just deskmates?

282
00:20:25,075 --> 00:20:26,355
But I heard

283
00:20:26,355 --> 00:20:28,800
his former deskmate was his ex-girlfriend.

284
00:20:29,554 --> 00:20:30,944
Let me clarify.

285
00:20:30,944 --> 00:20:32,736
We were just deskmates,

286
00:20:32,736 --> 00:20:34,176
and that's all.

287
00:20:52,074 --> 00:20:53,088
<i>Lin Yujing,</i>

288
00:20:54,475 --> 00:20:55,968
<i>do you have anything else to say to me?</i>

289
00:21:06,114 --> 00:21:07,394
<i>Why did you choose
to come to Pucheng University?</i>

290
00:21:08,874 --> 00:21:10,464
<i>Because we made a promise</i>

291
00:21:10,976 --> 00:21:12,192
<i>to enter Pucheng University together.</i>

292
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:50,255
Hurry up, the bus is coming.

293
00:21:50,255 --> 00:21:51,354
The bus is here.

294
00:21:51,354 --> 00:21:52,544
Be careful.

295
00:21:54,624 --> 00:21:55,840
Get on the bus.

296
00:21:57,088 --> 00:21:58,496
Xu Ruyi.

297
00:22:00,114 --> 00:22:03,314
Senior, why are you here?

298
00:22:03,314 --> 00:22:04,775
The hot pot restaurant we're going to tonight

299
00:22:04,775 --> 00:22:05,955
is quite far from here,

300
00:22:05,955 --> 00:22:07,435
and I just happened to be nearby,

301
00:22:07,435 --> 00:22:09,315
thinking you would get off here,

302
00:22:09,315 --> 00:22:10,592
so I was waiting here for you.

303
00:22:11,392 --> 00:22:12,595
Let me carry this for you.

304
00:22:12,595 --> 00:22:14,720
Because it's quite far away.

305
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:16,384
Thank you.

306
00:22:16,384 --> 00:22:17,408
Let's go.

307
00:22:23,936 --> 00:22:25,024
Yujing.

308
00:22:26,176 --> 00:22:27,755
It's been a long time.

309
00:22:27,755 --> 00:22:29,035
It's been too long.

310
00:22:29,035 --> 00:22:30,272
It's been too long, bro.

311
00:22:30,272 --> 00:22:31,360
Did you guys come here smoothly?

312
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:32,435
Yeah, quite smooth.

313
00:22:32,435 --> 00:22:33,696
I got a seat as soon as I got on the bus

314
00:22:33,696 --> 00:22:36,992
and just happened to run into Senior He
when I got off.

315
00:22:36,992 --> 00:22:38,560
What a coincidence.

316
00:22:42,074 --> 00:22:43,655
I brought you some local products from home.

317
00:22:43,655 --> 00:22:46,154
- Take them back and try.
- Thanks a lot.

318
00:22:49,955 --> 00:22:52,032
Juan said he had something to do,

319
00:22:52,032 --> 00:22:53,440
so he couldn't come.

320
00:22:54,272 --> 00:22:55,575
And Wang Yiyang--

321
00:22:55,575 --> 00:22:57,440
He definitely told you if Juan didn't come,
he wouldn't come too,

322
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:58,834
and that he stood with Juan.

323
00:22:59,475 --> 00:23:02,144
Shen Juan
must have got something major going on.

324
00:23:02,144 --> 00:23:04,000
Right, we have plenty of time.

325
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,792
I'm happy as long as you two came.

326
00:23:05,792 --> 00:23:07,135
Sit down. Order anything you want.

327
00:23:07,135 --> 00:23:08,512
Order a lot.

328
00:23:11,554 --> 00:23:13,155
Our class did quite well in the exam.

329
00:23:13,155 --> 00:23:14,795
Our average score ranked second in the grade.

330
00:23:14,795 --> 00:23:16,175
Mr. Liu is doing fine, too.

331
00:23:16,175 --> 00:23:18,154
I've heard
he's leading the graduating class again.

332
00:23:18,914 --> 00:23:20,855
I'm studying Agriculture
at a university next to yours.

333
00:23:20,855 --> 00:23:22,595
Do you know where Wang Yiyang chose to go?

334
00:23:22,595 --> 00:23:24,335
Pucheng University of Arts,
majoring in New Media.

335
00:23:24,335 --> 00:23:25,635
It's in the university town.

336
00:23:25,635 --> 00:23:27,415
I think it's great for you
to choose Accounting.

337
00:23:27,415 --> 00:23:29,375
Didn't you like Math
when you were in high school?

338
00:23:29,375 --> 00:23:32,015
Actually,
whether I like it or not doesn't really matter.

339
00:23:32,015 --> 00:23:34,295
The main point is
that accountants can find jobs easily,

340
00:23:34,295 --> 00:23:35,520
and it's stable.

341
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:40,032
Have more meat.

342
00:23:41,344 --> 00:23:42,432
Thanks.

343
00:23:43,154 --> 00:23:44,352
You should eat more, too.

344
00:23:45,376 --> 00:23:47,584
- Thank you, Miss Lin.
- You're welcome.

345
00:23:47,584 --> 00:23:48,640
I'm going to the restroom.

346
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:49,824
- Okay.
- Wait for me.

347
00:23:52,515 --> 00:23:54,048
He didn't come today, but don't be mad.

348
00:23:54,594 --> 00:23:56,235
After all, you two haven't seen each other
for a year and a half.

349
00:23:56,235 --> 00:23:58,016
I know. I'm not angry.

350
00:23:58,560 --> 00:23:59,648
That's good.

351
00:23:59,648 --> 00:24:01,575
But I can't eat this meal for free today.

352
00:24:01,575 --> 00:24:03,114
I have a suggestion.

353
00:24:03,675 --> 00:24:04,768
It's up to you whether to listen or not.

354
00:24:06,914 --> 00:24:08,074
If he won't make the first move,

355
00:24:08,675 --> 00:24:09,984
you take the lead.

356
00:24:09,984 --> 00:24:11,095
Do you understand?

357
00:24:11,095 --> 00:24:13,440
When did you become so wise in your words??

358
00:24:19,296 --> 00:24:20,415
Thanks, He.

359
00:24:20,415 --> 00:24:21,472
It's nothing.

360
00:24:21,472 --> 00:24:22,720
Just treat me to another meal.

361
00:24:29,056 --> 00:24:31,494
Girls, are you free tonight?

362
00:24:31,494 --> 00:24:33,440
I have two movie tickets here.

363
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,075
I was supposed to go watch a movie
with a friend,

364
00:24:35,075 --> 00:24:36,576
but I have got something to do tonight.

365
00:24:36,576 --> 00:24:37,632
Why don't you go watch it?

366
00:24:37,632 --> 00:24:38,688
I can't go.

367
00:24:38,688 --> 00:24:39,936
My parents made plans with some friends.

368
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:41,568
I have to go have dinner with them.

369
00:24:42,834 --> 00:24:45,088
Lin Yujing, you can go.

370
00:24:45,088 --> 00:24:47,575
Ask Shen Juan to watch a movie with you

371
00:24:47,575 --> 00:24:49,024
and take this opportunity to get closer.

372
00:24:49,024 --> 00:24:50,594
It's such a great opportunity.
You should seize it.

373
00:24:50,594 --> 00:24:51,936
Yeah.

374
00:24:51,936 --> 00:24:54,016
And the point isn't really
about watching the movie.

375
00:24:54,016 --> 00:24:56,635
The point is to find topics to talk about
through the movie.

376
00:24:56,635 --> 00:24:57,875
If the conversation goes well,

377
00:24:57,875 --> 00:24:59,904
wouldn't the relationship gradually deepen?

378
00:25:01,554 --> 00:25:03,104
But if the conversation doesn't go well,

379
00:25:03,104 --> 00:25:04,224
it'll fall apart.

380
00:25:06,074 --> 00:25:07,488
I'll ask him first.

381
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:13,824
<i>[Do you want to watch a movie tonight?]</i>

382
00:25:18,432 --> 00:25:22,432
<i>[If you're busy, never mind.]</i>

383
00:25:31,776 --> 00:25:33,824
<i>[Okay.]</i>

384
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,050
<i>[See you at eight tonight
at the University Town Cinema.]</i>

385
00:25:39,136 --> 00:25:40,224
Right here.

386
00:25:51,275 --> 00:25:54,272
I heard from others
that this movie was quite good.

387
00:25:54,272 --> 00:25:55,515
It's especially suitable for…

388
00:26:08,955 --> 00:26:10,016
Suitable for what?

389
00:26:11,795 --> 00:26:14,176
Suitable for… young people.

390
00:26:15,275 --> 00:26:16,352
Young people.

391
00:26:23,235 --> 00:26:25,824
My roommate said that she cried
while watching this movie.

392
00:26:25,824 --> 00:26:28,608
The male and female leads
were childhood friends.

393
00:26:28,608 --> 00:26:31,136
But later on, they drifted apart
because of some misunderstandings.

394
00:26:31,136 --> 00:26:32,640
However, the male lead…

395
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,344
What happened to the male lead?

396
00:26:51,314 --> 00:26:52,352
Wait a minute.

397
00:27:03,136 --> 00:27:05,088
Shouldn't we be watching…?

398
00:27:06,528 --> 00:27:08,672
I see you're pretty good at picking movies.

399
00:27:09,914 --> 00:27:11,008
Can you tell me

400
00:27:11,715 --> 00:27:13,056
who cried while watching this movie?

401
00:27:15,136 --> 00:27:17,888
I… I almost cried.

402
00:27:28,768 --> 00:27:30,454
Actually, I just wanted to say

403
00:27:30,454 --> 00:27:32,832
we should be like the male and female leads
in another movie.

404
00:27:32,832 --> 00:27:34,094
No matter
what misunderstandings happened before,

405
00:27:34,094 --> 00:27:35,168
we should…

406
00:27:37,312 --> 00:27:38,432
What did you say?

407
00:27:39,936 --> 00:27:41,984
Never mind. You keep watching.

408
00:27:54,275 --> 00:27:55,424
You're back.

409
00:27:59,456 --> 00:28:00,512
How was it?

410
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:01,664
Was the movie good?

411
00:28:01,664 --> 00:28:02,816
Did you make up?

412
00:28:04,832 --> 00:28:06,368
You didn't mess it up, didn't you?

413
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:08,960
No way.

414
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,592
Isn't a touching love movie supposed

415
00:28:10,592 --> 00:28:13,152
to be a catalyst for the relationship
between men and women?

416
00:28:14,715 --> 00:28:16,064
It is quite touching,

417
00:28:16,064 --> 00:28:17,915
but it's a Bollywood film, Flipped.

418
00:28:17,915 --> 00:28:19,254
They were singing and dancing the whole time.

419
00:28:19,254 --> 00:28:21,312
I couldn't find a quiet moment to talk.

420
00:28:22,755 --> 00:28:23,936
Bollywood?

421
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:25,515
Sorry,

422
00:28:26,314 --> 00:28:27,776
I didn't get it right.

423
00:28:27,776 --> 00:28:28,800
No.

424
00:28:29,435 --> 00:28:31,392
The real problem lies with me.

425
00:28:32,114 --> 00:28:34,912
Lin Yujing, you've finally realized.

426
00:28:34,912 --> 00:28:36,832
I've thoroughly come to understand.

427
00:28:36,832 --> 00:28:38,912
Instead of sighing behind his back,

428
00:28:38,912 --> 00:28:40,480
I might as well say it out loud.

429
00:28:46,272 --> 00:28:47,392
<i>Where are you?</i>

430
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:48,736
<i>I have something for you.</i>

431
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,200
<i>I'm going to class.</i>

432
00:28:57,314 --> 00:28:58,464
Your milk tea.

433
00:28:59,995 --> 00:29:01,504
Hello, what would you like to drink?

434
00:29:07,552 --> 00:29:08,800
Hello.

435
00:29:10,016 --> 00:29:12,354
I've tried almost all the milk teas
in this shop.

436
00:29:12,354 --> 00:29:13,792
I strongly recommend

437
00:29:13,792 --> 00:29:15,614
their Oolong Macchiato.

438
00:29:15,614 --> 00:29:16,704
Have it less sweet with no ice.

439
00:29:16,704 --> 00:29:17,856
I suggest you try it.

440
00:29:17,856 --> 00:29:19,395
No need, I've already decided.

441
00:29:19,395 --> 00:29:20,416
Thank you.

442
00:29:21,632 --> 00:29:22,675
Your milk tea.

443
00:29:22,675 --> 00:29:24,928
Hello, I'd like a cup
of the signature milk tea, full sugar.

444
00:29:24,928 --> 00:29:26,795
Okay, please scan this. It's 12 yuan.

445
00:29:27,755 --> 00:29:29,575
I suggest you might want to go for half-sugar.

446
00:29:29,575 --> 00:29:31,815
Because the milk
in their signature milk tea is soy milk,

447
00:29:31,815 --> 00:29:33,472
and the tea base itself contains sugar.

448
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:36,135
No need. I'm buying it for my boyfriend.

449
00:29:36,135 --> 00:29:37,515
He has a sweet tooth,

450
00:29:37,515 --> 00:29:38,834
so I would order full sugar.

451
00:29:41,834 --> 00:29:45,275
What a nice girlfriend.

452
00:30:05,914 --> 00:30:07,040
Shen Juan,

453
00:30:08,275 --> 00:30:09,920
I bought you rice balls and milk tea.

454
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,360
Have some before class.

455
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:16,256
Do you have something to say to me?

456
00:30:18,784 --> 00:30:20,640
I wanted to say--

457
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:21,824
Shen Juan,

458
00:30:26,314 --> 00:30:28,235
you really can't judge a book by its cover.

459
00:30:28,795 --> 00:30:31,232
Some people may look tough,

460
00:30:31,232 --> 00:30:35,392
but in fact, they have a sweet tooth.

461
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:40,455
I know. Don't covet your friend's wife.

462
00:30:40,455 --> 00:30:41,472
I'll make my exit first.

463
00:30:50,235 --> 00:30:52,032
I bumped into him at the milk tea shop,

464
00:30:52,032 --> 00:30:53,088
and there was a bit of a misunderstanding.

465
00:30:53,088 --> 00:30:54,714
So I used you as a shield.

466
00:30:54,714 --> 00:30:55,968
These are for you.

467
00:31:04,992 --> 00:31:06,975
I have a class. I should go. Bye.

468
00:31:06,975 --> 00:31:08,064
Lin Yujing,

469
00:31:09,696 --> 00:31:11,594
did you come here just to say these things?

470
00:31:17,856 --> 00:31:20,992
Actually, I wanted to say
that I was wrong back then.

471
00:31:20,992 --> 00:31:22,560
It was right for you to be angry.

472
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:24,855
But I'm making up for my mistakes now,
aren't I?

473
00:31:24,855 --> 00:31:26,848
The soda and peanuts from last time,

474
00:31:26,848 --> 00:31:28,704
and the milk tea this time.

475
00:31:31,275 --> 00:31:33,634
Can you be happy after drinking the milk tea?

476
00:31:34,235 --> 00:31:35,264
Lin Yujing,

477
00:31:36,435 --> 00:31:37,955
this is not the right way to appease people.

478
00:31:40,515 --> 00:31:41,554
I'm going to class.

479
00:31:54,304 --> 00:31:56,834
<i>[Let go of your anger
after drinking the milk tea.]</i>

480
00:32:01,312 --> 00:32:03,232
<i>[Got it.]</i>

481
00:32:11,314 --> 00:32:14,208
If you want to infer causal relationships
between variables,

482
00:32:14,208 --> 00:32:16,832
the quantitative analysis

483
00:32:16,832 --> 00:32:18,496
must be based on economic theory.

484
00:32:18,496 --> 00:32:20,515
That is, theoretically,

485
00:32:20,515 --> 00:32:23,895
there is a mechanism for X to cause Y.

486
00:32:23,895 --> 00:32:26,208
That's all for today's class.

487
00:32:26,208 --> 00:32:28,224
If you have any questions,
feel free to contact me.

488
00:32:31,074 --> 00:32:32,795
So your boyfriend is also from our university?

489
00:32:32,795 --> 00:32:33,824
Yes.

490
00:32:33,824 --> 00:32:35,254
Electronic and Electrical Engineering.

491
00:32:35,254 --> 00:32:36,354
Nice.

492
00:32:37,354 --> 00:32:39,795
Lin Yujing, come here. Let me introduce you.

493
00:32:39,795 --> 00:32:42,535
This is the day student in our dorm.

494
00:32:42,535 --> 00:32:44,474
Hello, I'm Li Wenwen

495
00:32:44,474 --> 00:32:45,754
from the School of Communication.

496
00:32:45,754 --> 00:32:47,255
I came today to pick up some materials

497
00:32:47,255 --> 00:32:49,184
and to say hello to everyone.

498
00:32:49,184 --> 00:32:50,594
Hello, Lin Yujing.

499
00:32:50,594 --> 00:32:51,594
Hello.

500
00:32:51,594 --> 00:32:52,640
Welcome.

501
00:32:53,554 --> 00:32:55,475
Today, all four of us are finally here.

502
00:32:55,475 --> 00:32:57,695
Why don't we go out and celebrate tonight?

503
00:32:57,695 --> 00:32:59,755
Yeah, how about I treat you

504
00:33:00,256 --> 00:33:01,344
to karaoke tonight?

505
00:33:01,344 --> 00:33:02,368
Sounds good.

506
00:33:02,368 --> 00:33:03,495
No need to treat us.

507
00:33:03,495 --> 00:33:04,655
We can go Dutch.

508
00:33:04,655 --> 00:33:06,035
How can that be?

509
00:33:06,035 --> 00:33:07,714
Even though I don't often come to the dorm,

510
00:33:07,714 --> 00:33:09,695
I still need to stay occasionally.

511
00:33:09,695 --> 00:33:11,955
You guys don't want me
to share the public expenses.

512
00:33:11,955 --> 00:33:13,394
I should at least do something, right?

513
00:33:14,275 --> 00:33:15,315
Then it's settled.

514
00:33:15,315 --> 00:33:18,515
Tonight, we'll go all out and get drunk.

515
00:33:18,515 --> 00:33:19,755
Come on, girls.

516
00:33:20,435 --> 00:33:22,925
Let's celebrate the first gathering
of room 602.

517
00:33:22,925 --> 00:33:24,755
- Let's drink.
- Cheers.

518
00:33:25,475 --> 00:33:27,200
Lin Yujing, raise your glass.

519
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:28,594
- I did.
- Wine.

520
00:33:29,914 --> 00:33:31,315
I don't drink.

521
00:33:31,315 --> 00:33:32,515
Alcohol changes my personality.

522
00:33:32,515 --> 00:33:33,795
No way.

523
00:33:33,795 --> 00:33:36,320
Today is our first gathering.

524
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:37,634
How can we do it without alcohol?

525
00:33:38,195 --> 00:33:39,455
Besides, it's just us.

526
00:33:39,455 --> 00:33:40,655
Don't mind making a fool of ourselves.

527
00:33:40,655 --> 00:33:43,015
Yeah, I want to see what you become

528
00:33:43,015 --> 00:33:44,512
after getting drunk.

529
00:33:44,512 --> 00:33:46,095
- I--
- Lin Yujing,

530
00:33:46,095 --> 00:33:48,480
we haven't been in touch for over a year.

531
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:50,176
Today, you have to drink this alcohol.

532
00:33:50,176 --> 00:33:51,200
You owe me this.

533
00:33:52,235 --> 00:33:53,376
You're sure?

534
00:33:53,376 --> 00:33:54,432
We're sure.

535
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:55,456
Enough. No more talking.

536
00:33:55,456 --> 00:33:56,955
- No regrets?
- No regrets.

537
00:33:56,955 --> 00:33:57,955
- Come on.
- I'll do it.

538
00:33:57,955 --> 00:33:59,055
Come on.

539
00:33:59,055 --> 00:34:00,435
Cheers.

<i>Shen Juan.</i>

549
00:34:40,235 --> 00:34:41,280
Are you drunk?

550
00:34:42,075 --> 00:34:43,648
<i>Shen Juan.</i>

551
00:34:43,648 --> 00:34:44,704
Where are you?

552
00:34:46,314 --> 00:34:48,960
Why aren't you responding to me?

553
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:51,354
I've been so good to you.

554
00:34:51,914 --> 00:34:54,976
You clearly know what I want to say to you.

555
00:34:54,976 --> 00:34:56,874
Why are you like this?

556
00:34:56,874 --> 00:34:58,414
<i>Shen Juan, come now.</i>

557
00:34:58,414 --> 00:35:00,256
<i>Lin Yujing is drunk.</i>

558
00:35:02,034 --> 00:35:03,040
<i>Shen Juan.</i>

559
00:35:03,595 --> 00:35:04,992
<i>Shen Juan, right?</i>

560
00:35:05,504 --> 00:35:06,655
<i>What's wrong with you?</i>

561
00:35:06,655 --> 00:35:07,904
<i>Why are you still putting up a front?</i>

562
00:35:08,994 --> 00:35:11,328
No, can you give the phone to Lin Yujing first?

563
00:35:11,328 --> 00:35:12,954
<i>Let me order the song What Kind of Man Are You.</i>

564
00:35:12,954 --> 00:35:13,974
<i>What kind of man are you?</i>

565
00:35:13,974 --> 00:35:14,994
<i>I'll order.</i>

566
00:35:14,994 --> 00:35:16,320
<i>Order it.</i>

567
00:35:17,792 --> 00:35:18,816
Where are you now?

568
00:35:18,816 --> 00:35:19,904
I'll come there right away.

569
00:35:21,115 --> 00:35:23,040
Or should I come to fight you?

570
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:25,735
That jewelry store, right? Wait for me.

571
00:35:25,735 --> 00:35:26,880
I'm coming.

572
00:35:44,155 --> 00:35:45,440
Shen Juan,

573
00:35:49,914 --> 00:35:52,434
Shen Juan, open the door for me.

574
00:35:55,296 --> 00:35:56,394
It's open.

575
00:35:58,752 --> 00:35:59,834
Shen Juan,

576
00:36:00,555 --> 00:36:01,635
Orange,

577
00:36:02,314 --> 00:36:03,434
Orange.

578
00:36:47,904 --> 00:36:49,024
Lin Yujing,

579
00:36:53,555 --> 00:36:54,934
- come down first.
- Don't touch me.

580
00:36:54,934 --> 00:36:56,128
It's me, Shen Juan.

581
00:36:57,755 --> 00:36:59,200
Shen Juan?

582
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:01,472
You don't look like him.

583
00:37:05,115 --> 00:37:06,624
You're not him.

584
00:37:11,136 --> 00:37:12,192
Come down.

585
00:37:12,914 --> 00:37:14,016
Hurry.

586
00:37:14,016 --> 00:37:15,115
Be careful.

587
00:37:17,914 --> 00:37:20,000
You know you can't drink,
yet you drank so much.

588
00:37:23,675 --> 00:37:24,704
Shen Juan.

589
00:37:36,994 --> 00:37:38,176
Shen Juan,

590
00:37:39,195 --> 00:37:40,448
can you

591
00:37:41,874 --> 00:37:43,840
stop being mad at me?

592
00:37:47,075 --> 00:37:49,155
Shen Juan.

593
00:37:51,712 --> 00:37:52,755
I…

594
00:37:53,555 --> 00:37:54,752
I'm not mad.

595
00:38:03,034 --> 00:38:04,096
Come here.

596
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:05,792
Be careful.

597
00:38:27,555 --> 00:38:32,192
Actually, I wasn't going to leave
without saying goodbye.

598
00:38:33,514 --> 00:38:36,096
I waited for you at the school gate,

599
00:38:36,994 --> 00:38:38,715
but I didn't see you.

600
00:38:42,314 --> 00:38:44,394
Then my mom took me away.

601
00:38:46,474 --> 00:38:48,608
She even confiscated my phone.

602
00:38:48,608 --> 00:38:50,336
I couldn't contact you.

603
00:38:52,874 --> 00:38:55,328
But later I went to the school security booth

604
00:38:55,328 --> 00:38:56,576
and borrowed a phone.

605
00:38:57,914 --> 00:38:59,008
I…

606
00:39:00,514 --> 00:39:01,984
I called you.

607
00:39:01,984 --> 00:39:05,056
I kept calling,

608
00:39:05,056 --> 00:39:06,464
but you didn't pick up.

609
00:39:07,954 --> 00:39:09,635
I thought you…

610
00:39:10,635 --> 00:39:12,834
I thought you didn't want to
talk to me anymore.

611
00:39:38,954 --> 00:39:41,984
I made a call back then.

612
00:39:43,474 --> 00:39:45,795
The person on the other end said
I got the wrong number.

613
00:39:50,816 --> 00:39:51,840
I'm sorry.

614
00:39:56,795 --> 00:39:58,400
Don't say that.

615
00:39:59,648 --> 00:40:01,595
The person who should say sorry is me.

616
00:40:04,354 --> 00:40:06,354
The person who left
without saying goodbye is also me.

617
00:40:08,635 --> 00:40:09,792
Actually,

618
00:40:11,874 --> 00:40:14,368
I really want to know what you've been through

619
00:40:14,368 --> 00:40:15,994
in the last year since we were apart.

620
00:40:20,275 --> 00:40:22,914
I remember our promise.

621
00:40:22,914 --> 00:40:25,856
We said
we would apply for Pucheng University together.

622
00:40:35,264 --> 00:40:37,120
So I came to see you.

623
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:46,314
But you're not easily appeased anymore.

624
00:40:53,834 --> 00:40:55,875
The shop was pitch black.

625
00:40:55,875 --> 00:40:57,434
There was nobody.

626
00:40:58,394 --> 00:41:00,855
The key wasn't in its usual place either.

627
00:41:00,855 --> 00:41:04,715
I feel like we can't go back to the past.

628
00:41:07,595 --> 00:41:08,755
It's like…

629
00:41:12,034 --> 00:41:14,275
it's like I've lost you.

630
00:41:22,474 --> 00:41:23,648
Lin Yujing.

631
00:41:25,152 --> 00:41:26,336
I…

632
00:41:30,394 --> 00:41:31,520
Shen Juan,

633
00:41:32,275 --> 00:41:33,440
do you know?

634
00:41:36,155 --> 00:41:38,434
During the time we've been apart,

635
00:41:42,675 --> 00:41:45,376
I really missed you so much.

636
00:42:16,514 --> 00:42:19,104
<i>If it hadn't been for the warm night breeze,</i>

637
00:42:19,104 --> 00:42:20,994
<i>the strong alcohol</i>

638
00:42:20,994 --> 00:42:22,955
<i>and your intense gaze that night,</i>

639
00:42:22,955 --> 00:42:24,800
<i>who knows</i>

640
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:27,616
<i>how long it would've taken
for me to say "I miss you".</i>

641
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:30,592
<i>Did you hear me?</i>

642
00:42:43,834 --> 00:42:48,378
<i>♫ Love sprouts in my palm ♫</i>

643
00:42:49,690 --> 00:42:53,530
<i>♫ Yet worried linger within my eyes ♫</i>

644
00:42:55,322 --> 00:42:59,898
<i>♫ Our story hasn't ended ♫</i>

645
00:43:00,826 --> 00:43:04,506
<i>♫ So where are we now ♫</i>

646
00:43:06,330 --> 00:43:11,994
<i>♫ I want to hug you so badly ♫</i>

647
00:43:11,994 --> 00:43:16,058
<i>♫ I want to become better with you ♫</i>

648
00:43:17,306 --> 00:43:22,170
<i>♫ The youth we shared ♫</i>

649
00:43:22,170 --> 00:43:28,218
<i>♫ Turned into a rainbow within my heart ♫</i>

650
00:43:28,730 --> 00:43:34,298
<i>♫ I really want to warm you ♫</i>

651
00:43:34,298 --> 00:43:36,186
<i>♫ I want to share with you ♫</i>

652
00:43:36,186 --> 00:43:40,858
<i>♫ The beauty of the world ♫</i>

653
00:43:41,742 --> 00:43:43,962
<i>♫ We promised ♫</i>

654
00:43:44,538 --> 00:43:50,234
<i>♫ To never be apart ♫</i>

655
00:43:50,970 --> 00:43:56,672
<i>♫ Do you want to hear me sing ♫</i>

656
00:43:56,672 --> 00:44:01,434
<i>♫ The wind chime swaying in my heart ♫</i>

657
00:44:01,978 --> 00:44:06,202
<i>♫ Is a wish ♫</i>

658
00:44:06,938 --> 00:44:12,826
<i>♫ I secretly made for you ♫</i>

659
00:44:13,370 --> 00:44:18,906
<i>♫ I want to plant ♫</i>

660
00:44:18,906 --> 00:44:20,794
<i>♫ A red maple forest ♫</i>

661
00:44:20,794 --> 00:44:25,402
<i>♫ To dye the whole mountain red ♫</i>

662
00:44:26,330 --> 00:44:28,570
<i>♫ The sky after the rain ♫</i>

663
00:44:29,210 --> 00:44:34,138
<i>♫ Was painted by our brilliant dreams ♫</i>

664
00:44:41,018 --> 00:44:45,786
<i>♫ Time is a flower of dream ♫</i>

665
00:44:46,618 --> 00:44:51,704
<i>♫ You've already collected it ♫</i>

666
00:44:52,634 --> 00:44:56,634
<i>♫ When we all become better ♫</i>

667
00:44:58,106 --> 00:45:02,234
<i>♫ We'll see the best of the world together ♫</i>
