All of you should learn from Lin Yujing.

185
00:18:55,909 --> 00:18:58,789
Whether in quizzes or monthly exams,

186
00:18:58,789 --> 00:19:00,229
she's always the first.

187
00:19:00,229 --> 00:19:01,229
In today's class,

188
00:19:01,229 --> 00:19:03,929
everyone redoes the wrong questions
from the test.

189
00:19:03,929 --> 00:19:05,069
Take out your papers.

190
00:19:14,869 --> 00:19:17,629
Sir, may I borrow your phone? Thank you.

191
00:19:38,149 --> 00:19:40,188
Hello, is this Shen Juan?

192
00:19:42,629 --> 00:19:44,629
Sorry, wrong number.

193
00:20:07,228 --> 00:20:08,769
Hello, is this Shen Juan?

194
00:20:08,769 --> 00:20:10,829
I'm sorry, wrong number.

195
00:20:12,708 --> 00:20:14,629
Sorry, I dialed the wrong number.

196
00:20:54,188 --> 00:20:56,529
<i>Mom, I got out of school early.</i>

197
00:20:56,529 --> 00:20:58,988
I'm right across from you. Come out.

198
00:21:02,948 --> 00:21:03,948
Okay.

199
00:21:14,668 --> 00:21:15,729
You go home.

200
00:21:15,729 --> 00:21:17,748
Your dad and Uncle must have things to do.

201
00:21:18,589 --> 00:21:19,904
It's okay.

202
00:21:20,829 --> 00:21:23,429
Juan, don't keep it all to yourself.

203
00:21:23,429 --> 00:21:24,809
Your body will break down.

204
00:21:24,809 --> 00:21:27,869
How about you take it out on me?

205
00:21:29,869 --> 00:21:30,949
And Lin Yujing--

206
00:21:30,949 --> 00:21:32,384
Stop it.

207
00:21:35,149 --> 00:21:38,109
Your phone seemed to ring just now.

208
00:21:40,748 --> 00:21:42,080
We're leaving.

209
00:21:42,829 --> 00:21:44,032
See you.

210
00:22:06,028 --> 00:22:07,668
<i>Huaicheng</i>

211
00:22:07,668 --> 00:22:08,832
Thank you, sir.

212
00:23:07,428 --> 00:23:08,829
Why did you finish class early today?

213
00:23:09,508 --> 00:23:10,909
I have a stomachache.

214
00:23:11,468 --> 00:23:12,736
Are you okay?

215
00:23:16,708 --> 00:23:17,824
Let's go.

216
00:23:38,909 --> 00:23:42,188
Qinghua, I came to see you.

217
00:23:49,109 --> 00:23:50,528
When I was a kid,

218
00:23:52,069 --> 00:23:53,748
I always looked forward to summer vacation,

219
00:23:55,109 --> 00:23:56,169
because during the summer vacation,

220
00:23:56,169 --> 00:23:57,549
my mom would come back to see me.

221
00:24:00,109 --> 00:24:01,589
Until I was ten,

222
00:24:02,708 --> 00:24:04,508
I knew my mom would never come back.

223
00:24:06,909 --> 00:24:08,349
And you never came back either.

224
00:24:13,152 --> 00:24:14,428
I'm sorry.

225
00:24:16,909 --> 00:24:18,069
My uncle took me

226
00:24:18,069 --> 00:24:20,069
to visit my mom every year.

227
00:24:22,389 --> 00:24:23,669
He always told me

228
00:24:23,669 --> 00:24:26,109
you and my mom have always loved me very much.

229
00:24:26,869 --> 00:24:30,149
You love me and your own careers.

230
00:24:30,988 --> 00:24:33,069
My mom was still fighting for her career

231
00:24:34,309 --> 00:24:36,228
in her last moments of life.

232
00:24:38,268 --> 00:24:39,988
Uncle said he and my mom were the same.

233
00:24:41,909 --> 00:24:45,109
They can dedicate their lives
to their beloved careers.

234
00:24:46,668 --> 00:24:48,829
He said I would understand when I grow up.

235
00:24:49,789 --> 00:24:52,028
Qinghe taught you well.

236
00:24:53,428 --> 00:24:54,720
Juan,

237
00:24:55,668 --> 00:24:59,069
I didn't care enough for you before.

238
00:25:00,149 --> 00:25:01,389
From now on,

239
00:25:01,389 --> 00:25:02,829
I will do my best

240
00:25:03,988 --> 00:25:06,428
to make up for some past regrets.

241
00:25:07,549 --> 00:25:10,228
If you have any difficulties, you can tell me.

242
00:25:12,988 --> 00:25:14,468
I want to discuss with you

243
00:25:16,228 --> 00:25:17,668
about your shop.

244
00:25:18,829 --> 00:25:19,988
Running a shop

245
00:25:20,508 --> 00:25:21,988
takes a lot of effort.

246
00:25:23,268 --> 00:25:24,829
You're going
to take the college entrance exam next year.

247
00:25:25,629 --> 00:25:28,188
It matters to your future.

248
00:25:30,069 --> 00:25:32,589
You might as well focus on preparing for it.

249
00:25:33,109 --> 00:25:36,289
After you get into college, you can consider

250
00:25:36,289 --> 00:25:38,389
whether to continue running this shop.

251
00:25:39,389 --> 00:25:43,468
I'll pay the shop rent for the next two years.

252
00:25:46,909 --> 00:25:48,128
Juan.

253
00:25:49,629 --> 00:25:52,069
It's time to move on.

254
00:25:53,789 --> 00:25:55,508
This is also what Qinghe

255
00:25:56,468 --> 00:25:57,829
and your mom hope for.

256
00:26:16,109 --> 00:26:17,188
Alright.

257
00:26:25,629 --> 00:26:26,668
Dad.

258
00:26:35,789 --> 00:26:36,948
Take good care of yourself.

259
00:26:37,589 --> 00:26:40,629
Okay, you too.

260
00:26:42,228 --> 00:26:43,909
I'll find time to come back to see you.

261
00:27:01,508 --> 00:27:05,309
From now on, it's just the two of us.

262
00:27:20,549 --> 00:27:23,049
You always skip steps.

263
00:27:23,049 --> 00:27:24,349
If you get a wrong answer,

264
00:27:24,349 --> 00:27:25,748
you'll have no scores at all.

265
00:27:27,349 --> 00:27:29,449
<i>Can you get the step score
by answering like this?</i>

266
00:27:29,449 --> 00:27:31,349
<i>It's okay as long as I get the scoring points.</i>

267
00:27:41,349 --> 00:27:42,948
It's okay as long as I get the scoring points.

268
00:28:20,909 --> 00:28:22,829
<i>What did you do with He Songnan yesterday?</i>

269
00:28:23,349 --> 00:28:24,949
<i>I fed the geese with him.</i>

270
00:28:24,949 --> 00:28:26,228
<i>The geese are quite fierce.</i>

271
00:28:27,789 --> 00:28:29,508
<i>Who?</i>

272
00:28:29,508 --> 00:28:30,828
<i>He Songnan.</i>

273
00:28:30,828 --> 00:28:32,309
<i>He fed geese?</i>

274
00:28:32,948 --> 00:28:34,549
<i>He was bitten by a goose when he was a kid.</i>

275
00:28:35,708 --> 00:28:36,869
<i>Didn't you hear of that?</i>

276
00:28:37,988 --> 00:28:39,789
<i>Juan and I saw it.</i>

277
00:28:39,789 --> 00:28:42,569
<i>Back then, he took fodder to tease the goose</i>

278
00:28:42,569 --> 00:28:44,449
<i>but didn't feed it.</i>

279
00:28:44,449 --> 00:28:45,848
<i>The goose got angry.</i>

280
00:28:45,848 --> 00:28:47,269
<i>That goose chased him</i>

281
00:28:47,269 --> 00:28:48,689
<i>all over the farm.</i>

282
00:28:48,689 --> 00:28:49,868
<i>It tried to bite him.</i>

283
00:28:49,868 --> 00:28:51,049
<i>As a result,</i>

284
00:28:51,049 --> 00:28:52,449
<i>he scared his dog.</i>

285
00:28:52,449 --> 00:28:55,009
<i>so, the goose chased him,
and he chased the dog.</i>

286
00:28:55,009 --> 00:28:57,209
<i>Then the dog fell into the river,</i>

287
00:28:57,209 --> 00:28:59,009
<i>and the goose bit him on the butt.</i>

288
00:28:59,009 --> 00:29:00,269
<i>He didn't eat a bite</i>

289
00:29:00,269 --> 00:29:02,029
<i>of the stewed goose meat that night.</i>

290
00:29:02,029 --> 00:29:03,508
<i>He was freaked out.</i>

291
00:29:04,028 --> 00:29:05,149
<i>Everyone, be quiet.</i>

292
00:29:07,808 --> 00:29:09,188
<i>Go back to your seat.</i>

293
00:29:33,606 --> 00:29:42,272
<i>[Shen Juan]</i>

294
00:30:36,909 --> 00:30:38,389
<i>I think</i>

295
00:30:38,389 --> 00:30:40,549
<i>it's good to stay here forever.</i>

296
00:30:40,549 --> 00:30:41,629
<i>Then don't leave.</i>

297
00:30:42,629 --> 00:30:43,769
<i>Stay here forever.</i>

298
00:30:43,769 --> 00:30:45,009
<i>Let's both get into Pucheng University.</i>

299
00:30:45,009 --> 00:30:47,789
<i>Okay, it's a deal.</i>

300
00:30:47,789 --> 00:30:49,428
<i>We'll be classmates for four years.</i>

301
00:30:50,829 --> 00:30:52,248
<i>We're so young.</i>

302
00:30:52,248 --> 00:30:53,589
<i>We have a bright future ahead.</i>

303
00:30:55,789 --> 00:30:57,109
<i>And even if we have to part ways,</i>

304
00:30:58,629 --> 00:31:03,309
<i>we'll meet again
as long as we remember each other.</i>

305
00:31:04,198 --> 00:31:10,615
<i>♫ That's where it guides us ♫</i>

306
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:18,240
<i>♫ You are the weary bird in my palm ♫</i>

307
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:21,504
<i>♫ I can't bear to let you fly far away ♫</i>

308
00:31:21,504 --> 00:31:24,594
<i>♫ I am the paper boat in your heart ♫</i>

309
00:31:24,594 --> 00:31:28,000
<i>♫ And you are my only harbor ♫</i>

310
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,836
<i>♫ Time is the sand
slipping through my fingers ♫</i>

311
00:31:31,836 --> 00:31:34,991
<i>♫ Playing the flute of youth ♫</i>

312
00:31:34,991 --> 00:31:38,366
<i>♫ I wait for you to be back ♫</i>

313
00:31:38,366 --> 00:31:41,953
<i>♫ The weary bird returns ♫</i>

314
00:32:22,309 --> 00:32:23,668
I came to see you.

315
00:32:29,589 --> 00:32:31,088
My dad told me

316
00:32:31,088 --> 00:32:32,708
to close the shop

317
00:32:33,829 --> 00:32:34,869
and focus on studying.

318
00:32:38,109 --> 00:32:39,988
I know he's right.

319
00:32:50,149 --> 00:32:51,708
But I just can't bear to close it.

320
00:32:58,309 --> 00:32:59,829
I'm afraid that after closing the shop,

321
00:33:03,589 --> 00:33:05,349
I can't lie to myself anymore

322
00:33:06,869 --> 00:33:08,508
that you're still with me.

323
00:33:39,268 --> 00:33:41,309
Juan, we're back.

324
00:33:46,589 --> 00:33:48,748
Juan, what are you doing?

325
00:33:49,549 --> 00:33:50,829
I'm going to close the shop.

326
00:33:52,109 --> 00:33:53,188
Why?

327
00:33:55,748 --> 00:33:56,989
But it's good to close it.

328
00:33:56,989 --> 00:33:58,468
After all, you will
take the college entrance exam next year.

329
00:33:59,028 --> 00:34:01,349
I'll go back to school next Monday.

330
00:34:01,349 --> 00:34:02,429
Really?

331
00:34:02,429 --> 00:34:03,769
That's great.

332
00:34:03,769 --> 00:34:06,068
Juan, you're finally back.

333
00:34:06,068 --> 00:34:08,949
Juan, I missed you so much.

334
00:34:08,949 --> 00:34:11,329
We've had two monthly exams this month.

335
00:34:11,329 --> 00:34:13,028
Next week is the midterm exam.

336
00:34:14,028 --> 00:34:16,629
Yes, since Lin Yujing left,
you have no competitors.

337
00:34:16,629 --> 00:34:18,909
But you'll meet her
during the college entrance exam.

338
00:34:18,909 --> 00:34:20,409
If you really meet her again,

339
00:34:20,409 --> 00:34:22,248
do you think you can catch up with her?

340
00:34:22,248 --> 00:34:24,369
Don't listen to him.
He just can't do his homework

341
00:34:24,369 --> 00:34:25,709
and wants to copy yours.

342
00:34:25,709 --> 00:34:27,229
Don't mention Lin Yujing.

343
00:34:31,108 --> 00:34:32,369
Are you my buddy?

344
00:34:32,369 --> 00:34:33,829
Why are you always ruining my plans?

345
00:34:36,028 --> 00:34:37,049
Juan.

346
00:34:37,049 --> 00:34:38,689
Look at the dark circles under my eyes.

347
00:34:38,689 --> 00:34:40,389
I haven't slept for two days.

348
00:34:40,389 --> 00:34:42,588
I did papers even in my dreams.

349
00:34:43,108 --> 00:34:44,449
When you were here,

350
00:34:44,449 --> 00:34:46,229
you could help me.

351
00:34:46,229 --> 00:34:47,329
But if you're not,

352
00:34:47,329 --> 00:34:49,669
who's going to help me?

353
00:34:50,749 --> 00:34:52,669
I'm afraid
I won't make it to the college entrance exam.

354
00:34:53,829 --> 00:34:55,108
Don't say such unlucky things.

355
00:34:55,628 --> 00:34:57,428
I said that from my heart.

356
00:35:02,229 --> 00:35:03,269
Alright.

357
00:35:04,108 --> 00:35:05,588
You're not needed here.

358
00:35:05,588 --> 00:35:07,489
You help me find the cat.

359
00:35:07,489 --> 00:35:08,948
I'm taking it with me.

360
00:35:09,628 --> 00:35:11,548
Okay, leave it to us.

361
00:35:25,468 --> 00:35:27,028
Alright, stop meowing.

362
00:35:27,909 --> 00:35:28,909
If you keep meowing,

363
00:35:30,028 --> 00:35:31,869
you'll be a stray cat again.

364
00:35:41,988 --> 00:35:43,229
The shop is closed.

365
00:35:45,028 --> 00:35:46,468
My youth has also ended.

366
00:35:48,829 --> 00:35:50,588
Drop the act. Your youth can be revived

367
00:35:50,588 --> 00:35:51,988
with a game controller

368
00:35:51,988 --> 00:35:53,589
What does it have to do with the shop?

369
00:35:53,589 --> 00:35:54,989
Get out of here.

370
00:35:54,989 --> 00:35:56,409
At least I've fought

371
00:35:56,409 --> 00:35:58,189
and worked hard for this shop.

372
00:36:01,669 --> 00:36:02,829
It's just temporarily closed.

373
00:36:04,669 --> 00:36:05,669
Maybe

374
00:36:06,349 --> 00:36:07,429
it'll reopen in the future.

375
00:36:07,429 --> 00:36:08,449
Exactly.

376
00:36:08,449 --> 00:36:10,449
Maybe it'll reopen in the future,

377
00:36:10,449 --> 00:36:11,569
right?

378
00:36:11,569 --> 00:36:13,369
When we've made a lot of money,

379
00:36:13,369 --> 00:36:14,949
We'll buy this place.

380
00:36:14,949 --> 00:36:17,629
When we're happy, we'll open for business.

381
00:36:17,629 --> 00:36:19,068
When you're upset,

382
00:36:19,068 --> 00:36:20,948
we can close it and enjoy hot pot here.

383
00:36:22,028 --> 00:36:24,048
Wang Yiyang is right. It could happen.

384
00:36:24,048 --> 00:36:25,468
We can always come back.

385
00:36:29,789 --> 00:36:31,264
Come in.

386
00:36:37,628 --> 00:36:40,109
Just move these boxes

387
00:36:40,109 --> 00:36:41,189
on the floor.

388
00:37:03,749 --> 00:37:05,308
Sweetie.

389
00:37:05,308 --> 00:37:06,989
You're really lucky.

390
00:37:06,989 --> 00:37:08,548
You have an owner to feed you.

391
00:37:12,148 --> 00:37:13,760
Let's go.

392
00:37:19,588 --> 00:37:20,896
Go.

393
00:38:45,349 --> 00:38:46,909
Sit. Let's start.

394
00:38:46,909 --> 00:38:49,068
Take out your test papers.

395
00:38:49,909 --> 00:38:51,508
I'll start with question three.

396
00:38:52,588 --> 00:38:54,108
Most people got wrong about it.

397
00:39:01,749 --> 00:39:03,040
Good morning, sir.

398
00:39:05,749 --> 00:39:09,269
I stayed up all night doing homework,
so I'm late.

399
00:39:12,028 --> 00:39:13,408
Come in.

400
00:41:00,166 --> 00:41:02,784
<i>[The First Place: Lin Yujing]</i>

401
00:42:14,749 --> 00:42:16,148
I passed.

402
00:42:18,669 --> 00:42:21,748
<i>You said parting didn't mean losing each other.</i>

403
00:42:21,748 --> 00:42:23,229
<i>We can be cool with it.</i>

404
00:42:24,269 --> 00:42:25,589
<i>But I've experienced the pain</i>

405
00:42:25,589 --> 00:42:29,349
<i>of missing you day and night.</i>

406
00:42:30,068 --> 00:42:31,389
<i>Fortunately, you are my destination.</i>

407
00:42:32,189 --> 00:42:35,468
<i>Otherwise, I wouldn't even have the courage
to move forward.</i>

408
00:42:48,006 --> 00:42:52,550
<i>♫ Love sprouts in my palm ♫</i>

409
00:42:53,862 --> 00:42:57,702
