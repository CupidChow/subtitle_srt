Today, Lin Yujing

20
00:01:42,739 --> 00:01:48,760
owes Li Lin a serving of fried dumplings
and a bottle of soy milk.

21
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:53,620
15.5 yuan in total.

22
00:01:57,419 --> 00:02:00,179
You can pay me back at the end of the month.

23
00:02:00,819 --> 00:02:03,380
Did you tell on me? Speak up.

24
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:05,659
Did you?

25
00:02:08,339 --> 00:02:10,979
Forget it. Let's go.

26
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:23,960
Credit

27
00:02:28,299 --> 00:02:31,179
Her name is Xu Ruyi.

28
00:02:31,179 --> 00:02:32,619
She's in our class.

29
00:02:32,619 --> 00:02:35,480
The one who just left is Gu Xia. She's also in our class.

30
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:37,499
They don't get along?

31
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,340
They share a dorm.

32
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:43,139
Gu Xia is the recreation and sports secretary
in our class.

33
00:02:43,139 --> 00:02:45,800
She's pretty.

34
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:50,640
Although not as pretty as you, she is a bona fide beauty.

35
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:54,159
Xu Ruyi is from a small county.

36
00:02:54,159 --> 00:02:56,660
Her family seems not very well-off.

37
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:59,339
She doesn't interact with others

38
00:02:59,339 --> 00:03:01,900
and stammers.

39
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:03,620
Why is Gu Xia so overbearing?

40
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:05,559
Overbearing?

41
00:03:08,499 --> 00:03:13,319
Speaking of which, your desk-mate is really overbearing.

42
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:14,956
How so?

43
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:19,519
I heard he beat up his previous deskmate last semester

44
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:24,019
The guy was sent to the hospital.
It was serious.

45
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,680
How could you laugh?

46
00:03:49,879 --> 00:03:51,939
Sorry, go on.

47
00:03:51,939 --> 00:03:53,420
You are his deskmate now.

48
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:58,800
Did he bully you?

49
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:03,859
Stop laughing. I'm serious.

50
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:08,219
What if one day… You never know.

51
00:04:08,219 --> 00:04:12,199
Anyway, you should ask Liu to arrange for a seat change.

52
00:04:12,199 --> 00:04:14,939
Got it, thanks.

53
00:04:14,939 --> 00:04:16,892
You're welcome.

54
00:04:16,892 --> 00:04:19,120
Everyone tries to avoid him.

55
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,459
If he catches and corners you…

56
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:30,100
So, you better stay away from him.

57
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:52,739
<i>Anyway, you should ask Liu o arrange for a seat change.</i>

58
00:04:58,876 --> 00:05:00,580
What's the matter?

59
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,720
You are Shen Juan?

60
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:09,460
I know you are Lin Yujing.

61
00:05:09,959 --> 00:05:11,599
When will my bracelet be repaired?

62
00:05:11,599 --> 00:05:13,580
It's already repaired.

63
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:19,360
What's the repair cost? I'll do my part.

64
00:05:21,139 --> 00:05:22,736
What else then?

65
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:36,540
Lin Yujing, it's time to get up.

66
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:39,239
It's time for breakfast.

67
00:05:39,239 --> 00:05:40,560
Lin Yujing.

68
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,660
Don't wake her up.
Our home is close to the school.

69
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:45,680
No need to get up so early.

70
00:05:46,259 --> 00:05:48,980
She's spoiled by her mother.

71
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:51,039
She still sleeps late at this age.

72
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:53,379
Alright, let's go. We're going to be late.

73
00:05:53,379 --> 00:05:56,699
Yujing, don't forget your milk on the table.

74
00:05:56,699 --> 00:05:58,516
Let's go.

75
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:27,180
Hello, my name is Lin Yujing.

76
00:06:33,399 --> 00:06:35,939
Hello, my name is Lin Yujing.

77
00:06:40,899 --> 00:06:44,620
I heard you were not feeling well last night.
What happened?

78
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:46,876
I had a temperature.

79
00:06:46,876 --> 00:06:50,100
Is it serious? What's the temperature?

80
00:06:54,059 --> 00:06:55,479
40 degrees.

81
00:06:55,479 --> 00:06:58,920
Do you want me to call 119 for you?

82
00:07:00,499 --> 00:07:02,860
If you need it, let me know.

83
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:15,979
Dad, I want to board at school.

84
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:19,939
<i>What? No, I don't agree.</i>

85
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:21,760
Why can't I board at school?

86
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:23,760
<i>I said no.</i>

87
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:25,155
<i>Don't argue with me.</i>

88
00:07:25,155 --> 00:07:28,216
I can't concentrate at home.
I do it better at school.

89
00:07:28,216 --> 00:07:29,576
And it saves time.

90
00:07:29,576 --> 00:07:31,755
<i>Don't make excuses.</i>

91
00:07:31,755 --> 00:07:35,555
<i>Your brother didn't board before,
but it didn't affect his studies.</i>

92
00:07:35,555 --> 00:07:37,676
Didn't he do well in the college entrance exam?

93
00:07:37,676 --> 00:07:38,855
<i>Why are you so picky?</i>

94
00:07:38,855 --> 00:07:41,036
He's not my brother.

95
00:07:41,036 --> 00:07:42,476
I regard him as my brother,

96
00:07:42,476 --> 00:07:44,755
but he never treats me as his sister.

97
00:07:44,755 --> 00:07:47,184
You--

98
00:08:03,855 --> 00:08:05,396
Come with me.

99
00:08:05,396 --> 00:08:08,816
Come here. Drop the act.

100
00:08:08,816 --> 00:08:11,876
You told the dormitory supervisor
about the hair dye.

101
00:08:11,876 --> 00:08:14,016
You're playing dumb, aren't you?

102
00:08:14,016 --> 00:08:15,796
It's not me.

103
00:08:15,796 --> 00:08:17,075
Can't you speak?

104
00:08:17,075 --> 00:08:19,896
You're not dumb at all.

105
00:08:19,896 --> 00:08:21,995
Are you a stutter?

106
00:08:21,995 --> 00:08:25,516
I'm telling you. I saw you do that.

107
00:08:25,516 --> 00:08:27,616
Did you do it on purpose?

108
00:08:29,476 --> 00:08:31,696
The teacher will know if your hair is dyed.

109
00:08:31,696 --> 00:08:34,235
No one is blind, so no need to tell on you.

110
00:08:34,235 --> 00:08:36,456
You know the school doesn't allow hair dyeing.

111
00:08:36,456 --> 00:08:38,675
Are you venting your anger on others?

112
00:08:38,675 --> 00:08:41,216
Why are you here?
Are you eavesdropping on our conversation?

113
00:08:41,216 --> 00:08:44,095
We're just talking now. You stay out of his.

114
00:08:44,095 --> 00:08:46,955
Why don't you just leave through that door?

115
00:08:46,955 --> 00:08:48,456
I know where the door is.

116
00:08:48,456 --> 00:08:49,796
You think I want to interfere?

117
00:08:49,796 --> 00:08:52,235
This is a public place.
You guys are disturbing me.

118
00:08:52,235 --> 00:08:53,780
You…

119
00:08:55,515 --> 00:08:57,755
You're the newcomer, right?

120
00:08:57,755 --> 00:08:59,996
Lin something…

121
00:08:59,996 --> 00:09:02,436
Lin Yujing.

122
00:09:02,436 --> 00:09:04,435
Lin Yujing?

123
00:09:04,435 --> 00:09:08,715
We were talking about our matters. None of your business.

124
00:09:11,336 --> 00:09:13,595
You know who I am.

125
00:09:17,196 --> 00:09:19,656
So you also know who my seatmate is, right?

126
00:09:19,656 --> 00:09:22,576
So, you want to give it a try?

127
00:09:26,596 --> 00:09:28,416
Are you threatening me?

128
00:09:28,416 --> 00:09:30,035
I don't want to threaten you,

129
00:09:30,035 --> 00:09:32,696
but I also don't like seeing you do it
to others.

130
00:09:36,015 --> 00:09:38,416
I haven't finished yet.

131
00:09:38,416 --> 00:09:40,416
It's okay, Gu Xia.

132
00:09:40,416 --> 00:09:41,936
Anyway, she's in our class.

133
00:09:41,936 --> 00:09:44,456
Let's go fight her now. Come on.

134
00:09:49,035 --> 00:09:51,475
Are you going to fight my seatmate?

135
00:09:51,475 --> 00:09:53,976
No, we're not.

136
00:09:53,976 --> 00:09:57,955
Fine, keep your voices down.

137
00:09:57,955 --> 00:09:59,856
You're disturbing my sleep.

138
00:10:03,096 --> 00:10:05,875
Gu Xia, let's go.

139
00:10:12,435 --> 00:10:15,196
I've never seen her. Is she new?

140
00:10:15,196 --> 00:10:19,236
Well, thank you.

141
00:10:19,236 --> 00:10:22,255
But will you…

142
00:10:22,255 --> 00:10:25,976
Not at all, I just thought they were too loud.

143
00:10:41,015 --> 00:10:45,655
Juan, guess whom I just ran into?

144
00:10:45,655 --> 00:10:48,236
I met the girl
who came to our store for repairing.

145
00:10:48,236 --> 00:10:50,416
She's in our school.

146
00:10:50,416 --> 00:10:52,495
I'll find out which class she's in.

147
00:10:52,495 --> 00:10:54,492
No need.

148
00:10:54,492 --> 00:10:56,340
You know it?

149
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:59,216
She's in my class, my deskmate.

150
00:11:10,135 --> 00:11:12,435
Any instructions?

151
00:11:12,435 --> 00:11:14,152
Come this way.

152
00:11:44,916 --> 00:11:48,235
Look, no one is even paying attention to her.

153
00:11:55,010 --> 00:11:57,255
She's the school bully's deskmate.

154
00:11:57,255 --> 00:12:00,655
Isn't she afraid of getting beaten up?

155
00:12:00,655 --> 00:12:02,235
She must not be easy to mess with,

156
00:12:02,235 --> 00:12:05,236
or, who would dare
to be the school bully's deskmate.

157
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:10,575
D-Don't say something like that.

158
00:12:10,575 --> 00:12:12,876
S-She's not like that.

159
00:12:21,216 --> 00:12:23,795
Today in PE, we'll do sit-up tests.

160
00:12:23,795 --> 00:12:25,616
Do it in pairs.

161
00:12:25,616 --> 00:12:27,416
The partner holding the legs does the counting.

162
00:12:27,416 --> 00:12:29,135
Got it.

163
00:12:29,135 --> 00:12:31,155
Dismissed to get mats.

164
00:12:31,155 --> 00:12:34,435
Xu Ruyi, we're a team.

165
00:12:50,676 --> 00:12:52,655
The three of you form one group.

166
00:12:52,655 --> 00:12:54,576
Sir, the two of us are good.

167
00:12:54,576 --> 00:12:57,455
How about you let her team up with others?

168
00:12:58,216 --> 00:13:01,236
Xu Ruyi, hold my legs.

169
00:13:06,884 --> 00:13:08,404
Come on.

170
00:13:10,735 --> 00:13:14,016
Your deskmate is being isolated.

171
00:13:15,396 --> 00:13:17,096
Help her out.

172
00:13:19,476 --> 00:13:21,155
It's okay. She can handle it herself.

173
00:13:21,155 --> 00:13:23,076
You believe in her so much, huh?

174
00:13:23,076 --> 00:13:24,796
Go on.

175
00:14:10,755 --> 00:14:12,404
Juan.

176
00:14:13,775 --> 00:14:15,676
What's your hurry?

177
00:14:15,676 --> 00:14:18,236
We just met but lost you.

178
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:20,775
Aren't you going to say hello?

179
00:14:20,775 --> 00:14:22,484
To whom?

180
00:14:23,715 --> 00:14:26,216
You mean her? I'm not.

181
00:14:26,216 --> 00:14:27,436
What's wrong?

182
00:14:27,436 --> 00:14:30,355
She's not easygoing.

183
00:14:30,355 --> 00:14:32,735
Is Juan also afraid of her?

184
00:14:32,735 --> 00:14:34,776
Are you kidding?

185
00:14:45,216 --> 00:14:47,155
I've already met the person involved.

186
00:14:47,155 --> 00:14:49,595
I need to prepare case materials.

187
00:14:53,876 --> 00:14:56,596
<i>I found the pen part you were looking for.</i>

188
00:15:02,276 --> 00:15:03,756
Hold on a second.

189
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:10,676
Brother.

190
00:15:11,396 --> 00:15:13,936
You bring me that file tomorrow morning.

191
00:15:13,936 --> 00:15:16,956
I'll be there at nine,
and the concerned party will also come.

192
00:15:16,956 --> 00:15:20,316
That file is crucial.
You must deliver it personally.

193
00:15:23,896 --> 00:15:25,995
Can you be quiet?

194
00:15:26,635 --> 00:15:28,376
Got it.

195
00:15:30,936 --> 00:15:32,484
Brother.

196
00:15:34,135 --> 00:15:36,655
I found you love milk.

197
00:15:36,655 --> 00:15:39,336
Do you want some? I bought quite a lot.

198
00:15:39,336 --> 00:15:41,595
You couldn't find any in the fridge?

199
00:15:41,595 --> 00:15:43,816
Are you out of food or drinks?

200
00:15:43,816 --> 00:15:48,016
There's plenty of it in the fridge, but it's not mine.

201
00:15:48,016 --> 00:15:50,652
I can't just take them.

202
00:15:50,652 --> 00:15:53,455
You may not understand, but I'm living under someone's roof.

203
00:15:53,455 --> 00:15:55,676
I can't be too casual.

204
00:15:59,056 --> 00:16:01,895
If there's nothing else,
I'll go back to my room.

205
00:16:15,576 --> 00:16:18,176
Lin Yujing, I know you.

206
00:16:18,176 --> 00:16:19,895
Where's the pen?

207
00:16:19,895 --> 00:16:22,176
Time's up.

208
00:16:22,176 --> 00:16:23,876
What time's up?

209
00:16:23,876 --> 00:16:26,664
Give it back.

210
00:16:26,664 --> 00:16:29,116
I asked my friend to get the part.

211
00:16:29,116 --> 00:16:30,615
I didn't know if you wanted to install it,

212
00:16:30,615 --> 00:16:32,915
so I didn't ask him to do it for you.

213
00:16:32,915 --> 00:16:35,396
The part is a bit old,

214
00:16:35,396 --> 00:16:36,716
but there's a repair guide.

215
00:16:36,716 --> 00:16:39,568
If you want to install it,
you can do it yourself.

216
00:16:40,456 --> 00:16:42,655
How much is it? I'll transfer it to you.

217
00:16:43,436 --> 00:16:45,240
Where's my bracelet?

218
00:16:47,456 --> 00:16:49,835
Pick it up at my shop tonight.

219
00:16:49,835 --> 00:16:51,364
Okay.

220
00:16:55,355 --> 00:16:58,335
She's good.

221
00:16:58,335 --> 00:17:00,835
Isn't she trustworthy?

222
00:17:02,176 --> 00:17:03,936
But she always looks distant

223
00:17:03,936 --> 00:17:07,995
without the human touch. Such a pity.

224
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:20,895
<i>[Qinghe Silverware]</i>

225
00:17:28,856 --> 00:17:30,915
I went back to school.

226
00:17:32,696 --> 00:17:37,835
I've looked for this part for so long and couldn't find it.

227
00:17:39,335 --> 00:17:41,736
I didn't expect her to find it.

228
00:18:06,236 --> 00:18:10,235
Look, it seems new.

229
00:18:18,481 --> 00:18:21,824
<i>[Go for it, Juan]</i>

230
00:18:25,936 --> 00:18:28,176
We'll be back after the holiday.

231
00:18:28,176 --> 00:18:31,095
Take good care of yourself and your sister.

232
00:18:31,095 --> 00:18:34,716
You still have a cold.
Don't forget to take your medicine.

233
00:18:37,496 --> 00:18:39,896
Mingxiu, thank you.

234
00:18:39,896 --> 00:18:42,376
Sorry to trouble you with taking care of home.

235
00:18:42,376 --> 00:18:45,015
If Yujing causes any trouble,
feel free to criticize her.

236
00:18:45,015 --> 00:18:46,708
It's okay.

237
00:18:48,316 --> 00:18:49,596
Got it.

238
00:18:49,596 --> 00:18:52,856
Mom, the check-in counter is over there.

239
00:18:54,255 --> 00:18:55,596
I'm telling you.

240
00:18:55,596 --> 00:18:57,475
While I'm away, you behave yourself.

241
00:18:57,475 --> 00:18:59,796
You listen to your brother, alright?

242
00:19:00,435 --> 00:19:02,996
Also, your brother has a cold.

243
00:19:02,996 --> 00:19:04,716
Buy him some medicine.

244
00:19:04,716 --> 00:19:06,775
Take care of him.

245
00:19:06,775 --> 00:19:09,095
Alright, I've transferred the money to you.

246
00:19:09,095 --> 00:19:10,516
Only 50 yuan?

247
00:19:10,516 --> 00:19:13,815
It is enough for you to buy medicine.
How much more do you want?

248
00:19:13,815 --> 00:19:17,155
I have topped up your meal card and bus card. That's enough for you for a while.

249
00:19:17,155 --> 00:19:19,155
Weiguo, we got to go.

250
00:19:19,155 --> 00:19:21,796
Okay, let's go.

251
00:19:21,796 --> 00:19:24,036
Yujing, get along well with your brother.

252
00:19:24,036 --> 00:19:25,115
Don't worry, Aunt Guan.

253
00:19:25,115 --> 00:19:26,216
Alright, give it to me.

254
00:19:26,216 --> 00:19:27,416
- We're leaving now.
- Let's go.

255
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:28,475
Take care.

256
00:19:28,475 --> 00:19:30,475
You may go back.

257
00:19:41,270 --> 00:19:43,156
You're going the wrong way.

258
00:20:12,635 --> 00:20:13,915
You're almost home.

259
00:20:13,915 --> 00:20:16,100
I need to head to the law firm right now.

260
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:18,030
You go back by yourself.

261
00:22:21,610 --> 00:22:24,055
You have a cat?

262
00:22:27,856 --> 00:22:29,715
So cute.

263
00:22:30,570 --> 00:22:33,055
I brought it out for vaccination.

264
00:23:05,315 --> 00:23:09,595
Didn't you want to go to my shop to get back your bracelet?

265
00:23:16,376 --> 00:23:18,915
You don't want to go?

266
00:23:20,656 --> 00:23:22,836
Let's go, to inspect the goods.

267
00:23:50,855 --> 00:23:52,155
What's wrong?

268
00:23:52,155 --> 00:23:54,616
It really is a clingy cat.

269
00:23:54,616 --> 00:23:56,404
Go play.

270
00:23:57,556 --> 00:23:59,136
You know what?

271
00:23:59,136 --> 00:24:01,076
It only comes in when it rains.

272
00:24:01,076 --> 00:24:03,535
Normally, I can't see it.

273
00:24:03,535 --> 00:24:05,095
Such a carefree creature.

274
00:24:05,095 --> 00:24:06,788
That's great.

275
00:24:10,815 --> 00:24:12,915
Let's go, to inspect the goods.

276
00:24:12,915 --> 00:24:14,515
Okay.

277
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:20,592
You take a seat.

278
00:24:46,796 --> 00:24:49,155
Do you want to try it on?

279
00:24:49,155 --> 00:24:51,216
No need. Your craftsmanship is quite good.

280
00:24:51,216 --> 00:24:54,715
I can't see the cracks.

281
00:25:19,316 --> 00:25:21,435
- Alright.
- I've never seen a cat get vaccinated,

282
00:25:21,435 --> 00:25:23,716
wearing an Elizabethan collar.

283
00:25:24,376 --> 00:25:26,276
Did it just undergo a spaying surgery,

284
00:25:26,276 --> 00:25:28,535
or is it a troublemaker?

285
00:25:34,652 --> 00:25:35,776
Eat this.

286
00:25:35,776 --> 00:25:39,236
<i>I heard he beat up his previous deskmate last semester.</i>

287
00:25:39,236 --> 00:25:41,095
<i>You are his deskmate now.</i>

288
00:25:41,095 --> 00:25:46,095
<i>Well, did he bully you?</i>

289
00:25:51,495 --> 00:25:53,295
Juan.

290
00:25:53,295 --> 00:25:56,076
Where are you, Juan?

291
00:25:56,815 --> 00:25:59,276
Juan, we are about to start cooking. We must celebrate tonight.

292
00:25:59,276 --> 00:26:00,376
Here you are.

293
00:26:00,376 --> 00:26:02,535
Why are you here?

294
00:26:02,535 --> 00:26:05,655
Hi, we meet again. I'm He Songnan.

295
00:26:05,655 --> 00:26:07,176
Hi.

296
00:26:07,176 --> 00:26:09,656
Why are you trying to get close to her?

297
00:26:09,656 --> 00:26:12,335
Is it someone's birthday today?

298
00:26:12,335 --> 00:26:13,756
It's nobody's birthday.

299
00:26:13,756 --> 00:26:16,596
This cat was spayed today.

300
00:26:17,435 --> 00:26:19,876
You must celebrate it.

301
00:26:20,595 --> 00:26:23,316
I'm leaving.

302
00:26:24,015 --> 00:26:26,656
Do you want to stay and have a meal together?

303
00:26:26,656 --> 00:26:29,255
Yeah, it's still raining.

304
00:26:29,255 --> 00:26:30,335
Is your home nearby?

305
00:26:30,335 --> 00:26:32,595
Why don't we have a meal together?

306
00:26:32,595 --> 00:26:35,236
Stay. We're all classmates. Let's have a meal.

307
00:26:35,236 --> 00:26:37,276
It's a local tradition
of hospitality on rainy days.

308
00:26:37,276 --> 00:26:39,656
You can try the local hot pot.

309
00:26:39,656 --> 00:26:41,656
Am I right, Juan?

310
00:26:44,950 --> 00:26:46,496
Sit down.

311
00:26:53,176 --> 00:26:54,656
Cheers.

312
00:26:54,656 --> 00:26:57,456
We drink to the cat.

313
00:26:57,456 --> 00:27:00,896
May it have a peaceful cat life.

314
00:27:00,896 --> 00:27:04,015
And may those mother cats it has bullied have a peaceful life.

315
00:27:04,015 --> 00:27:06,435
Alright, cheers.

316
00:27:09,530 --> 00:27:12,796
I'm actually curious how did you guys meet?

317
00:27:12,796 --> 00:27:14,535
Juan and I--

318
00:27:14,535 --> 00:27:17,316
I was asking about you guys and the cat.

319
00:27:18,450 --> 00:27:21,236
It was a stray cat before and came here.

320
00:27:21,236 --> 00:27:23,896
Juan took pity on it
and fed it from time to time.

321
00:27:23,896 --> 00:27:26,516
Then it began living in the shop.

322
00:27:26,516 --> 00:27:28,255
I heard that cats have a sixth sense.

323
00:27:28,255 --> 00:27:30,116
They know who treats them well.

324
00:27:30,116 --> 00:27:32,156
Speaking of which, we should have a drink.

325
00:27:32,156 --> 00:27:34,995
People at our school are less cleverer than cats.

326
00:27:34,995 --> 00:27:37,355
They believe and spread all kinds of nonsense.

327
00:27:37,355 --> 00:27:39,476
That's ridiculous.

328
00:27:45,316 --> 00:27:47,815
We don't need everyone to understand us

329
00:27:47,815 --> 00:27:49,635
as long as people around us do.

330
00:27:49,635 --> 00:27:52,815
Why should we care how others think?

331
00:27:57,796 --> 00:28:00,716
Well said. Let's drink to that. Cheers.

332
00:28:00,716 --> 00:28:02,208
Cheers.

333
00:28:12,410 --> 00:28:14,796
I'm going to buy more beverage. Come with me.

334
00:28:14,796 --> 00:28:16,055
I haven't finished yet. You go by yourself.

335
00:28:16,055 --> 00:28:17,455
I can't carry it all by myself.

336
00:28:17,455 --> 00:28:18,495
Alright.

337
00:28:18,495 --> 00:28:20,316
Let's go. We'll be right back.

338
00:28:20,316 --> 00:28:21,868
Leave some for me.

339
00:28:22,696 --> 00:28:25,596
Juan, look after the house.

340
00:28:27,395 --> 00:28:29,116
- What are you doing?
- Hurry up.

341
00:28:29,116 --> 00:28:32,316
What are you doing? I'm still hungry.

342
00:28:32,316 --> 00:28:34,795
Is it enough to only eat hot pot?

343
00:28:34,795 --> 00:28:36,596
After buying the beverage,

344
00:28:36,596 --> 00:28:39,116
let's go buy some skewers. How about it?

345
00:28:39,116 --> 00:28:40,996
Good idea.

346
00:28:49,996 --> 00:28:53,735
These silver accessories are beautiful.
Did you make them?

347
00:28:58,395 --> 00:29:00,395
My uncle made them.

348
00:29:01,136 --> 00:29:04,235
He is a respectable craftsman.

349
00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:16,595
So, this is his shop?

350
00:29:17,495 --> 00:29:21,556
Yes, it's also my home.

351
00:29:25,170 --> 00:29:26,735
Do you want to eat some more?

352
00:29:26,735 --> 00:29:28,476
No, I'll wait for them to come back.

353
00:29:28,476 --> 00:29:30,095
After that, I will leave.

354
00:29:30,095 --> 00:29:31,476
Okay.

355
00:29:33,310 --> 00:29:35,596
Come on, he ran out again.

356
00:29:51,250 --> 00:29:53,135
It's raining outside.

357
00:29:53,135 --> 00:29:56,176
See how wet you got.

358
00:29:59,696 --> 00:30:01,652
Go have fun.

359
00:30:42,216 --> 00:30:44,675
<i>We don't need everyone to understand us</i>

360
00:30:44,675 --> 00:30:46,556
<i>as long as the people around us do.</i>

361
00:30:46,556 --> 00:30:49,656
<i>Why should we care how others think?</i>

365

Never mind. I'm not angry.

366
00:32:02,575 --> 00:32:06,076
So, is your face okay?

367
00:32:07,015 --> 00:32:08,588
It's fine.

368
00:32:11,836 --> 00:32:13,276
Your look was so terrifying just now.

369
00:32:13,276 --> 00:32:16,995
I thought the last person who slapped you was dead.

370
00:32:17,675 --> 00:32:20,136
The last person who slapped me?

371
00:32:20,136 --> 00:32:22,255
He hasn't shown up yet.

372

You're the first one.

373
00:32:30,735 --> 00:32:32,735
Why are you here again?

374
00:32:32,735 --> 00:32:34,395
I brought someone to see the house.

375
00:32:34,395 --> 00:32:35,835
Wait for me here.

376
00:32:35,835 --> 00:32:37,756
I'll go out and take a look.

Young man, l warn you.

378

I don't care what you did before.

379

Don't push your luck.

380

382
00:32:52,095 --> 00:32:53,696
If so, I will call the police.

383

Go ahead. Call the police.

384
00:32:55,095 --> 00:32:57,456
Uncle, you go back. Leave it to me.

385
00:32:57,456 --> 00:33:00,535
Shen Juan, they've been here several times.

386
00:33:00,535 --> 00:33:03,195
Don't become soft. This isn't over.

387

I'm looking for him, not you.

388

389

I'm his uncle.

390
00:33:10,195 --> 00:33:12,195
You didn't renew your lease on time.
I need a new tenant.

391
00:33:12,195 --> 00:33:14,696
How to renew it?

392
00:33:14,696 --> 00:33:16,696
The rent has increased many times in a year.

393
00:33:16,696 --> 00:33:18,115
I'm just an estate agent.

394
00:33:18,115 --> 00:33:19,516
The landlord sets the rent.

395
00:33:19,516 --> 00:33:21,195
If you think it's expensive,
just talk to the landlord.

396
00:33:21,195 --> 00:33:22,704
You…

397
00:33:24,656 --> 00:33:25,955
Alright.

398
00:33:25,955 --> 00:33:27,735
Shen Juan, take this.

399
00:33:27,735 --> 00:33:29,675
Don't let them get in today.

400
00:33:29,675 --> 00:33:31,835
Just wait. I'm going to talk to the landlord.

401
00:33:31,835 --> 00:33:34,236
Uncle, it's too late. Get back.

402
00:33:34,236 --> 00:33:37,575
Let's go inside. Move.

403
00:33:38,690 --> 00:33:40,000
Get out.

404
00:33:43,456 --> 00:33:47,495
Hey, do you think I'm a fool?

405
00:33:50,376 --> 00:33:54,176
Look at your stupid house.

406
00:33:55,535 --> 00:33:57,835
What's wrong with this house?

407
00:33:59,656 --> 00:34:02,556
Yes, what's wrong with my house?

408
00:34:03,076 --> 00:34:04,615
Are you here to see the house?

409
00:34:04,615 --> 00:34:05,776
Don't be fooled.

410

He said this house was great
at a prime location.

411
00:34:08,095 --> 00:34:09,856
In the end, I've been here all afternoon.

412
00:34:09,856 --> 00:34:11,256
Not even a dog passes by.

413
00:34:11,256 --> 00:34:13,676
This house is so old that the paint peels.

414
00:34:13,676 --> 00:34:16,135
If you rent this house,
you'll have to refurbish it all over again.

415
00:34:16,135 --> 00:34:17,895
And most importantly, this place is so dirty.

416
00:34:17,895 --> 00:34:19,435
- No, it's not.
- It is terrible.

417
00:34:19,435 --> 00:34:22,236
The rats are bigger than cats,
and they're not afraid of people.

418
00:34:22,236 --> 00:34:24,335
Be careful.

419
00:34:25,256 --> 00:34:26,932
Well…

420
00:34:27,875 --> 00:34:29,776

- Miss.
- Over there.

423
00:34:33,476 --> 00:34:37,456
Don't listen to her. She's making it all up. Miss, don't go.

424
00:34:42,256 --> 00:34:45,415
Well played. You're pulling tricks, aren't you?

425
00:34:45,415 --> 00:34:47,056
What are you doing?

426
00:34:47,876 --> 00:34:49,896
Why did you buy so much?

427

00:35:27,516 --> 00:35:30,316
This is my promise. Rent increase is fine.

434
00:35:30,316 --> 00:35:31,995
We'll pay the same as our neighbors.

435
00:35:31,995 --> 00:35:35,228
But I can't afford a sudden increase in rent.

436
00:35:35,228 --> 00:35:37,456
I'll give it to you
at the beginning of next month.

437

00:36:13,815 --> 00:36:16,035
I will talk to him.

445
00:36:16,035 --> 00:36:18,836
Given his current situation,
he's already struggling.

446
00:36:18,836 --> 00:36:21,696
Why don't we talk to our parents and pool together some money?

447
00:36:21,696 --> 00:36:25,336
Yeah, how about I ask my dad for an advance on a year's living expenses?

448
00:36:25,336 --> 00:36:28,676
My dad will support his righteous son.

<i>♫ Time is a flower of dream ♫</i>

<i>♫ You've already collected it ♫</i>

539
00:44:55,202 --> 00:45:00,790
<i>♫ When we all become better ♫</i>

540
00:45:00,790 --> 00:45:06,032
<i>♫ We'll see the best of the world together ♫</i>
