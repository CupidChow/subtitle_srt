Professor.

20
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:41,751
Your paper is finished?

21
00:01:41,751 --> 00:01:42,759
Please.

22
00:01:57,030 --> 00:01:58,510
Is there any problem?

23
00:01:59,151 --> 00:02:01,271
No, it's very good.

24
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:05,151
You are just a freshman,

25
00:02:05,151 --> 00:02:06,751
but your paper is so well written,

26
00:02:06,751 --> 00:02:08,910
clear in thought and unique in view.

27
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:11,151
Did anyone help you?

28
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:14,550
I did ask someone to organize the structure,

29
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:16,391
but every word is written by me,

30
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:19,351
Whether the extraction of the thesis
or the case analysis,

31
00:02:19,351 --> 00:02:20,470
you can ask me anything.

32
00:02:21,351 --> 00:02:23,590
The overall task achievement is good.

33
00:02:24,311 --> 00:02:26,671
With a few minor revisions,
it can be finalized.

34
00:02:27,351 --> 00:02:28,711
Very good.

35
00:02:28,711 --> 00:02:29,751
Thank you, professor.

36
00:02:34,711 --> 00:02:36,510
Did you see the message I sent you?

37
00:02:41,191 --> 00:02:42,871
I didn't. I was busy just now.

38
00:02:42,871 --> 00:02:44,630
Professor praised me for my paper.

39
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:46,791

We're going for an ultrasound.

52
00:03:18,831 --> 00:03:21,430
The doctor said
if all the indicators are stable,

53
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:22,695
maybe you can be discharged earlier.

54
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:39,231
Mom, wait here for a while.
I forgot the medical record.

55
00:03:39,231 --> 00:03:40,311
I will go get it.

56
00:03:49,671 --> 00:03:51,351
I have already got the number for your mom.

57
00:03:51,351 --> 00:03:52,751
You can do the following examination

58
00:03:52,751 --> 00:03:54,950
according to the order on it.
you probably don't have to queue.

59
00:03:55,871 --> 00:03:57,151
Thank you.

60
00:03:57,151 --> 00:03:58,470
Well done.

61
00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:00,110
I will do my best

62
00:04:01,311 --> 00:04:02,430

67
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:21,191
Okay, you take care of yourself.

68
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:22,910
I have to go.

69
00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:24,231
The check-up cannot be delayed.

70
00:04:24,231 --> 00:04:25,550
I'll see you at school.

71
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:26,599
Okay, go ahead.

72
00:04:40,311 --> 00:04:41,430
You got it so quickly.

73
00:04:42,711 --> 00:04:44,871
I ran there, afraid to delay the check-up.

74
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:53,231
Secretary Cui will come tomorrow.

75
00:04:53,231 --> 00:04:54,990
He has arranged a nurse for me.

76
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:56,510
You go back to school tomorrow.

00:04:56,510 --> 00:04:57,511
Don't delay your studies.

78
00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:01,030
I will go back
after I make things clear to him.

00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:02,110
Don't worry.

80
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:15,047

84
00:05:23,751 --> 00:05:24,831
Coach Lei called him back.

85
00:05:29,391 --> 00:05:31,351
You're very attentive.

86
00:05:31,351 --> 00:05:33,550
You even brought food and a juicer.

87
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:34,871
This is what my mother asked me to give you.

88
00:05:35,391 --> 00:05:37,231
You love oranges, right?

89
00:05:37,231 --> 00:05:39,191
I'm afraid you will not have enough of them.

90
00:05:39,191 --> 00:05:40,510
And I got you a juicer.

91
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:41,751
If you can't eat them all, you can make juice.

92
00:05:41,751 --> 00:05:43,910
Okay, I will take it in then.

93
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:45,271
- Go ahead.
- Thanks.

94
00:06:01,671 --> 00:06:02,727
Mr. Fu.

95
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:06,351
Why are you here?

96
00:06:06,351 --> 00:06:08,110
I came to see a friend.

97
00:06:08,751 --> 00:06:10,110
Do you have time now?

98
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:11,191
If you have time,

99
00:06:11,191 --> 00:06:13,671
let's find a place
and resolve the video matter.

100
00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:18,550
Okay.

101
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:19,630
Let's go.

102
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:33,751
Now can you delete the video?

103
00:06:36,311 --> 00:06:37,950
Before that,

104
00:06:38,671 --> 00:06:40,110
I have something to say to you.

105
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:44,039
Well,

106
00:06:45,231 --> 00:06:46,871
I recently read a novel.

107
00:06:46,871 --> 00:06:49,070
The story is particularly wonderful.

108
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:51,151
But I feel sorry
for the male secondary character.

109
00:06:51,151 --> 00:06:52,950
He likes the female lead

110
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:54,470
and is very nice to the female lead.

111
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:55,550
He sends her meals and fruits

112
00:06:55,550 --> 00:06:56,751
and cares for her.

113
00:06:56,751 --> 00:06:57,950
But the female lead is

114
00:06:57,950 --> 00:07:01,271
in love with someone else.
After going through a lot of things,

115
00:07:01,271 --> 00:07:02,351
they get together.

116
00:07:02,351 --> 00:07:03,831
The love between the two is stronger than ever.

117
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:06,630
In the end, the male secondary character

118
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:08,231
can only cry alone in sorrow.

119
00:07:08,751 --> 00:07:10,070
The ending is very tragic.

120
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:12,110
Mr. Fu.

121
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:14,351
Do you understand?

122
00:07:14,351 --> 00:07:15,711
No, I don't.

123
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:17,671
What do you mean by telling me this?

124
00:07:17,671 --> 00:07:20,671
I advise you to read less
of these boring novels.

125
00:07:22,751 --> 00:07:24,191
What I want to tell you is,

126
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:26,311
two people can be

127
00:07:26,311 --> 00:07:27,550
in mutual love.

128
00:07:28,311 --> 00:07:30,671
The relationship of three people is crowded.

129
00:07:30,671 --> 00:07:31,990
There is no need to squeeze in.

130
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:33,191
Do you understand?

131
00:07:33,191 --> 00:07:34,590
What does it have to do

132
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:35,990
with deleting the video?

133
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:37,831
How can you not understand?

134
00:07:37,831 --> 00:07:38,910
- I mean Lin Yujing--
- Gu Xia.

135
00:07:40,351 --> 00:07:41,391
Why are you here?

136
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:44,679
Brother.

137
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:47,687
Brother?

138
00:07:48,391 --> 00:07:49,910
He is your brother?

139
00:07:56,354 --> 00:07:58,595
I didn't expect
that you and my brother have such a connection.

140
00:07:58,595 --> 00:07:59,794
I think this story

141
00:07:59,794 --> 00:08:02,035
should be called a domineering boss

142
00:08:02,035 --> 00:08:03,555
and his naive intern.

143
00:08:04,074 --> 00:08:05,275
It's so fun to ship!

144
00:08:06,114 --> 00:08:07,755
You can ship anything, can't you?

145
00:08:07,755 --> 00:08:09,914
I advise you to read fewer boring novels
in your spare time.

146
00:08:10,514 --> 00:08:11,914
And you, Lin Yujing,

147
00:08:11,914 --> 00:08:13,914
why didn't you tell me
Fu Mingxiu was your brother?

148
00:08:13,914 --> 00:08:15,691
You made me so embarrassed.

149
00:08:15,691 --> 00:08:17,354
I didn't even know you two knew each other.

150
00:08:18,035 --> 00:08:19,394
Do you know

151
00:08:19,394 --> 00:08:21,794
people can die,
but they can't bear the embarrassment?

152
00:08:22,435 --> 00:08:23,715
You have to take responsibility for this.

153
00:08:24,435 --> 00:08:25,514
Alright.

154
00:08:25,514 --> 00:08:27,787
I told you before my brother came
to the hospital to accompany me.

155
00:08:27,787 --> 00:08:28,914
Who knew you would see it

156
00:08:28,914 --> 00:08:30,571
and even imagine a love triangle drama?

157
00:08:31,514 --> 00:08:33,755
The two of you,
one surnamed Lin and the other Fu.

158
00:08:33,755 --> 00:08:35,674
How could I have guessed
there was such a connection?

159
00:08:35,674 --> 00:08:36,747
Your brother

160
00:08:37,475 --> 00:08:39,475
is such a serious and earnest person.

161
00:08:40,114 --> 00:08:42,035
I talked nonsense in front of him.

162
00:08:42,715 --> 00:08:44,954
I don't know
what to say to him next time I see him.

163
00:08:46,715 --> 00:08:48,354
You're so afraid
of losing face in front of him.

164
00:08:48,914 --> 00:08:50,315
Do you have feelings for him?

165
00:08:51,914 --> 00:08:53,394
I… No…

166
00:08:53,394 --> 00:08:54,995
I don't. Don't talk nonsense!

167
00:08:55,715 --> 00:08:57,435
My brother seems to be cold

168
00:08:57,435 --> 00:08:59,035
and sometimes a bit boring,

169
00:08:59,035 --> 00:09:00,394
but he's still a pretty good person

170
00:09:00,394 --> 00:09:01,954
and quite worth getting to know.

171
00:09:01,954 --> 00:09:03,035
And the most important thing is

172
00:09:03,035 --> 00:09:04,074
that he's never been in a relationship.

173
00:09:07,394 --> 00:09:09,634
What does it matter to me
whether he's been in a relationship?

174
00:09:09,634 --> 00:09:10,914
I don't have feelings for him.

175
00:09:12,035 --> 00:09:13,194
Fine,

176
00:09:13,194 --> 00:09:15,155
then don't tell me until you like him.

177
00:09:15,155 --> 00:09:16,555
Anyway, treat me a bit better,

178
00:09:16,555 --> 00:09:18,234
then I'll say some good things
about you in front of him.

179
00:09:18,234 --> 00:09:20,475
It's quite hard for me to put in a good word.

180
00:09:20,475 --> 00:09:22,435
Right, Lin Yujing can advise you

181
00:09:22,435 --> 00:09:24,275
on your relationship as well as be a mole.

182
00:09:24,275 --> 00:09:26,315
Know ourselves and the enemy,

183
00:09:26,315 --> 00:09:27,555
then we can win every battle.

184
00:09:29,715 --> 00:09:31,634
What makes you two think
that I have a crush on him?

185
00:09:32,234 --> 00:09:33,291
Boring.

186
00:09:34,715 --> 00:09:36,435
Where are you going?
We haven't finished talking.

187
00:09:36,435 --> 00:09:37,715
I'm going to buy some food.

188
00:09:37,715 --> 00:09:38,795
I'm not going to chat with you guys.

189
00:10:02,394 --> 00:10:03,467
<i>[Are you there?]</i>

190
00:10:20,035 --> 00:10:21,354
<i>Mingxiu, what's wrong?</i>

191
00:10:22,354 --> 00:10:24,155
Nothing special.

192
00:10:24,155 --> 00:10:25,434
Where are you? Alone?

193
00:10:25,434 --> 00:10:27,635
You're usually so busy,
and you're now chatting with me?

194
00:10:28,715 --> 00:10:30,314
I just want to explain to you

195
00:10:31,475 --> 00:10:32,674
your roommate

196
00:10:32,674 --> 00:10:33,835
was previously

197
00:10:33,835 --> 00:10:34,859
an intern at our law firm.

198
00:10:35,595 --> 00:10:36,651
You know that, right?

199
00:10:37,434 --> 00:10:39,434
After she just went back,

200
00:10:39,434 --> 00:10:41,234
did she tell you anything about me?

201
00:10:42,835 --> 00:10:44,674
She did, and quite a lot.

202
00:10:47,955 --> 00:10:49,554
<i>All good things about you.</i>

203
00:10:49,554 --> 00:10:51,715
<i>I didn't even know my brother was so good.</i>

204
00:10:57,314 --> 00:10:58,674
Then it's okay.

205
00:10:58,674 --> 00:10:59,723
I'm going to hang up.

206
00:11:00,515 --> 00:11:02,234
You called me just to say this?

207
00:11:02,914 --> 00:11:04,794
You didn't fall for her, did you?

208
00:11:04,794 --> 00:11:06,075
No.

209
00:11:06,075 --> 00:11:08,155
I didn't. Don't talk nonsense.

210
00:11:08,155 --> 00:11:09,227
I'm hanging up.

211
00:11:21,835 --> 00:11:22,891
<i>[Are you there?]</i>

212
00:11:25,515 --> 00:11:27,195
<i>[Sorry, I just saw it.]</i>

213
00:11:27,195 --> 00:11:28,595
<i>[What's the matter?]</i>

214
00:11:38,155 --> 00:11:39,874
<i>[Are you free tomorrow night?]</i>

215
00:11:39,874 --> 00:11:41,075
<i>[I'd like to treat you to dinner.]</i>

216
00:11:47,234 --> 00:11:48,635
<i>[Or how about tonight?]</i>

217
00:11:48,635 --> 00:11:49,874
<i>[I haven't had dinner yet.]</i>

218
00:11:50,395 --> 00:11:52,195
<i>[Thank you for helping me with my paper.]</i>

219
00:11:52,195 --> 00:11:53,395
<i>[I should be the one treating.]</i>

220
00:11:53,914 --> 00:11:55,994
<i>[No, let me do it.]</i>

221
00:11:55,994 --> 00:11:58,155
<i>[My treat, and you delete the video.]</i>

222
00:11:58,155 --> 00:11:59,403
<i>[It's fair this way.]</i>

223
00:12:12,234 --> 00:12:13,554
What are you laughing at? You look so happy.

224
00:12:14,955 --> 00:12:16,354
I just learned something shocking.

225
00:12:16,354 --> 00:12:17,914
My brother is about to be in a relationship.

226
00:12:18,835 --> 00:12:20,314
I'll tell you more later.

227
00:12:20,314 --> 00:12:21,914
What do you want to talk to me about?

228
00:12:28,554 --> 00:12:31,434
I've been selected for the summer training
of our provincial team.

229
00:12:31,434 --> 00:12:33,595
Next week, I have to report.

230
00:12:33,595 --> 00:12:34,595
If you train well,

231
00:12:34,595 --> 00:12:35,874
could you make it to the provincial team?

232
00:12:38,434 --> 00:12:40,114
Congratulations, Shen Juan.

233
00:12:40,114 --> 00:12:42,114
You're one step closer to your dream
of representing the country.

234
00:12:44,114 --> 00:12:45,227
Just this?

235
00:12:48,475 --> 00:12:49,835
Then you train hard.

236
00:12:49,835 --> 00:12:51,674
I'll be your strongest supporter.

237
00:13:09,195 --> 00:13:10,595
Are you going on a date?

238
00:13:12,275 --> 00:13:14,354
No, just to see a friend.

239
00:13:14,354 --> 00:13:15,371
Gathering.

240
00:13:17,354 --> 00:13:19,794
With whom? You chose such formal clothes.

241
00:13:21,155 --> 00:13:22,914
Just an ordinary friend.

242
00:13:29,314 --> 00:13:30,347
This one's not bad.

243
00:13:30,955 --> 00:13:31,979
Really?

244
00:13:42,195 --> 00:13:43,243
Mr. Fu.

245
00:13:50,475 --> 00:13:52,275
- Have you been waiting long?
- Not too long.

246
00:13:54,434 --> 00:13:55,994
A major client just arrived.

247
00:13:56,914 --> 00:13:58,155
There might be a meeting.

248
00:13:58,835 --> 00:14:00,234
I'm afraid I won't be able

249
00:14:00,234 --> 00:14:01,515
to have dinner with you tonight.

250
00:14:04,234 --> 00:14:05,434
Then you go ahead.

251
00:14:06,354 --> 00:14:07,467
Here's your book back.

252
00:14:09,635 --> 00:14:10,891
By the way,

253
00:14:10,891 --> 00:14:12,515
I'll delete the video now.

254
00:14:15,195 --> 00:14:16,554
You don't have to worry about it anymore.

255
00:14:19,874 --> 00:14:22,411
If there's nothing else,
I'm going back to school.

256
00:14:22,411 --> 00:14:23,851
We'll have dinner together another day.

257
00:14:23,851 --> 00:14:25,514
Thank you for helping me with my thesis.

258
00:14:26,274 --> 00:14:27,339
I'm leaving.

259
00:14:38,963 --> 00:14:43,307
<i>[Critique of Pure Reason]</i>

260
00:15:09,955 --> 00:15:10,955
Come in.

261
00:15:10,955 --> 00:15:13,234
Mr. Fu, the client will be here soon.

262
00:15:13,234 --> 00:15:15,075
Let's go to the conference room and prepare.

263
00:15:16,874 --> 00:15:18,154
Is Mr. Chen in the office?

264
00:15:18,154 --> 00:15:19,211
Yes, he is.

265
00:16:10,595 --> 00:16:11,595
Gu Xia.

266
00:16:21,154 --> 00:16:22,155
Why are you here?

267
00:16:23,154 --> 00:16:24,754
Didn't you say you had a meeting?

268
00:16:28,475 --> 00:16:29,795
I had my colleague cover for me.

269
00:16:31,075 --> 00:16:33,274
How about we find a place to eat?

270
00:16:34,915 --> 00:16:36,835
Then let's go to a nearby convenience store.

271
00:16:36,835 --> 00:16:39,354
That way, if they call you back,
it's convenient.

272
00:16:41,354 --> 00:16:42,379
Wait a second.

273
00:16:59,715 --> 00:17:00,747
Let's go.

274
00:17:12,994 --> 00:17:14,059
Warm yourself first.

275
00:17:14,595 --> 00:17:15,659
Thanks.

276
00:17:21,514 --> 00:17:23,234
I didn't think we would have dinner today.

277
00:17:24,075 --> 00:17:25,075
And then there's the heavy rain.

278
00:17:26,955 --> 00:17:28,315
But you came.

279
00:17:29,795 --> 00:17:31,234
Thank you, Mr. Fu.

280
00:17:55,795 --> 00:17:56,835
My parents

281
00:17:57,754 --> 00:17:59,154
are always busy with work.

282
00:17:59,754 --> 00:18:01,034
They don't have time to be with me.

283
00:18:02,754 --> 00:18:05,114
It was the National Day holiday

284
00:18:05,754 --> 00:18:07,075
in my second year of high school, I guess.

285
00:18:07,754 --> 00:18:09,195
We planned to travel abroad,

286
00:18:09,795 --> 00:18:11,075
but I was stood up.

287
00:18:12,234 --> 00:18:13,291
Then

288
00:18:13,835 --> 00:18:15,723
I went to a hotel and stayed for seven days.

289
00:18:16,274 --> 00:18:17,394
I brought a bunch of fake souvenirs

290
00:18:17,394 --> 00:18:18,435
back to school for my classmates.

291
00:18:18,955 --> 00:18:20,874
I was found out by Lin Yujing.

292
00:18:20,874 --> 00:18:21,963
I even had an argument with her.

293
00:18:22,475 --> 00:18:23,955
It's funny to think about it now.

294
00:18:29,354 --> 00:18:30,955
But I'm used to it.

295
00:18:32,874 --> 00:18:34,835
Every time I'm stood up,

296
00:18:35,994 --> 00:18:37,675
I go to a convenience store
and get a capsule toy.

297
00:18:38,715 --> 00:18:40,514
I won't stop until I get one I like.

298
00:18:42,715 --> 00:18:43,755
Mr. Fu,

299
00:18:44,874 --> 00:18:46,155
I've told you my secret.

300
00:18:46,715 --> 00:18:48,675
I won't tell anyone about your embarrassment.

301
00:18:59,154 --> 00:19:00,235
Come with me.

302
00:19:17,634 --> 00:19:18,635
When I'm bored,

303
00:19:19,354 --> 00:19:21,114
I occasionally buy a capsule toy.

304
00:19:26,514 --> 00:19:28,634
I didn't know
you had a childlike side in your heart too.

305
00:19:31,354 --> 00:19:32,395
Then

306
00:19:32,955 --> 00:19:34,435
when we're free,

307
00:19:34,955 --> 00:19:36,354
we can have dinner

308
00:19:36,354 --> 00:19:37,715
and also buy capsule toys together.

309
00:20:36,075 --> 00:20:37,394
What's wrong?

310
00:20:37,394 --> 00:20:39,455
Looking at the book with such annoyance.

311
00:20:39,455 --> 00:20:40,795
Aren't you usually the one
who loves studying the most?

312
00:20:41,475 --> 00:20:43,394
You finally agreed to study with me.

313
00:20:43,394 --> 00:20:44,715
Why aren't you focusing on the book?

314
00:20:48,435 --> 00:20:50,075
So are you upset with me

315
00:20:50,075 --> 00:20:51,354
for not spending much time with you?

316
00:20:52,514 --> 00:20:53,754
Alright.

317
00:20:53,754 --> 00:20:56,315
From now on, I'll make more time for you.

318
00:20:59,394 --> 00:21:01,915
I've finally realized
what "there's no forced happiness" means.

319
00:21:03,075 --> 00:21:06,075
After reading finance for so long,
I still can't cultivate any interest in it.

320
00:21:07,475 --> 00:21:09,274
Why did you choose this major back then?

321
00:21:13,234 --> 00:21:15,354
I didn't have any specific majors in mind.

322
00:21:15,955 --> 00:21:17,475
My mom told me to choose it,

323
00:21:18,195 --> 00:21:19,211
so I did it.

324
00:21:21,195 --> 00:21:22,354
Have you decided

325
00:21:22,354 --> 00:21:23,874
what job you want to do in the future?

326
00:21:49,715 --> 00:21:51,154
Look at these hot comments.

327
00:21:51,795 --> 00:21:53,195
They are all negative.

328
00:21:53,195 --> 00:21:54,675
Someone even claims to be from Liying,

329
00:21:54,675 --> 00:21:56,354
saying they can confirm
that Juan's dropping out of school

330
00:21:56,354 --> 00:21:57,675
and the bullying incident are true.

331
00:21:58,435 --> 00:21:59,915
I'm speechless.

332
00:21:59,915 --> 00:22:01,483
I'll remember all these people's accounts.

333
00:22:02,075 --> 00:22:03,114
The most serious one is this.

334
00:22:03,675 --> 00:22:05,435
They ask, "Isn't it dangerous to let someone

335
00:22:05,435 --> 00:22:06,514
with a history of violence play shooting games?

336
00:22:06,514 --> 00:22:07,563
Does Pucheng University know about it?"

337
00:22:08,154 --> 00:22:09,675
Now everyone is upvoting this one.

338
00:22:09,675 --> 00:22:11,994
If this gets blown up,
it will affect your shooting career.

339
00:22:11,994 --> 00:22:14,274
When I found this post,
it was already a hot topic.

340
00:22:14,274 --> 00:22:16,274
Only a few people are speaking up for Juan.

341
00:22:16,274 --> 00:22:18,675
The rest are all taking pleasure in it
and watching the excitement.

342
00:22:19,315 --> 00:22:21,315
Who the heck posted this post?

343
00:22:21,315 --> 00:22:22,675
Is someone deliberately messing with Juan?

344
00:22:24,595 --> 00:22:25,707
Only Nie Xinghe and I

345
00:22:26,315 --> 00:22:27,715
have this disciplinary notice.

346
00:22:27,715 --> 00:22:28,779
It's him again.

347
00:22:29,315 --> 00:22:31,114
That jerk, why won't he go away?

348
00:22:31,114 --> 00:22:32,475
He just can't stand to see you doing well.

349
00:22:35,595 --> 00:22:36,683
Annoying.

350
00:22:40,874 --> 00:22:41,899
Yes.

351
00:22:42,874 --> 00:22:44,299
<i>I've had people investigate.</i>

352
00:22:44,299 --> 00:22:45,634
<i>Are you really going to be</i>

353
00:22:45,634 --> 00:22:46,667
<i>with such a man?</i>

354
00:22:47,595 --> 00:22:48,619
Alright.

355
00:22:48,619 --> 00:22:49,675
Got it.

356
00:22:52,994 --> 00:22:54,667
Don't worry too much about the post.

357
00:22:55,195 --> 00:22:57,115
Coach Lei just called me,

358
00:22:57,115 --> 00:22:58,115
asking me to go back to school.

359
00:22:59,074 --> 00:23:00,195
We'll talk about it when I get back.

360
00:23:00,195 --> 00:23:01,227
Okay.

361
00:23:12,635 --> 00:23:14,571
Mr. Cui, this is Lin Yujing.

362
00:23:15,195 --> 00:23:17,034
I have a question to ask you.

363
00:23:17,034 --> 00:23:19,994
My mom sent me some past information
about Shen Juan.

364
00:23:20,635 --> 00:23:22,355
Where did you guys get it?

365
00:23:32,034 --> 00:23:33,834
I object to canceling
Shen Juan's training qualification.

366
00:23:33,834 --> 00:23:35,475
I've seen those rumors.

367
00:23:35,475 --> 00:23:36,715
It's not what they say at all.

368
00:23:36,715 --> 00:23:38,794
Shen Juan was in the youth team before.

369
00:23:38,794 --> 00:23:40,274
I knew him then.

370
00:23:40,274 --> 00:23:42,875
I know what kind of person he is
better than anyone.

371
00:23:42,875 --> 00:23:45,899
Let me put it this way.
I can vouch for his good character.

372
00:23:45,899 --> 00:23:48,274
Give me some time. I'll handle it.

373
00:23:48,274 --> 00:23:50,539
Shen Juan is really a rare talent.

374
00:23:50,539 --> 00:23:52,074
It would be a pity to miss him.

375
00:23:53,994 --> 00:23:54,994
That's it for now.

376
00:24:04,554 --> 00:24:05,579
Come in.

377
00:24:20,915 --> 00:24:22,715
I want to talk to you about those posts online.

378
00:24:23,435 --> 00:24:24,459
You've seen them, haven't you?

379
00:24:29,435 --> 00:24:30,955
I know you're a good student,

380
00:24:31,635 --> 00:24:32,794
but this incident

381
00:24:32,794 --> 00:24:34,115
is definitely going to affect you.

382
00:24:35,915 --> 00:24:37,514
The provincial team just called,

383
00:24:38,875 --> 00:24:40,715
saying they're going to temporarily cancel
your training qualifications.

384
00:24:41,994 --> 00:24:43,074
I know, coach.

385
00:24:46,475 --> 00:24:49,074
I've talked to the school administration too.

386
00:24:49,675 --> 00:24:52,395
They need some time now to verify

387
00:24:52,395 --> 00:24:53,395
what's being said online.

388
00:24:54,514 --> 00:24:56,635
Once they've cleared things up,
they'll naturally restore your training.

389
00:25:03,594 --> 00:25:04,651
Just wait a little longer.

390
00:25:05,594 --> 00:25:06,635
I believe the school

391
00:25:07,155 --> 00:25:08,234
will handle this fairly.

392
00:25:08,955 --> 00:25:09,955
I know you are in a difficult position

393
00:25:10,834 --> 00:25:12,155
to deal with this matter.

394
00:25:13,715 --> 00:25:15,115
I also understand

395
00:25:15,115 --> 00:25:16,475
the school's decision about me.

396
00:25:21,314 --> 00:25:22,347
It's okay.

397
00:25:23,115 --> 00:25:24,203
Even if I can't do live fire training,

398
00:25:24,715 --> 00:25:26,074
there is still specialized training

399
00:25:26,074 --> 00:25:27,435
and physical training.

400
00:25:27,435 --> 00:25:28,754
I won't slack off.

401
00:25:36,834 --> 00:25:38,274
Well said.

402
00:25:38,274 --> 00:25:39,675
I'll ask Coach Yu

403
00:25:39,675 --> 00:25:42,915
to create a more targeted special training plan
for you

404
00:25:42,915 --> 00:25:45,034
to minimize the impact
of not being able to do live fire training.

405
00:25:47,274 --> 00:25:48,331
Alright.

406
00:26:06,594 --> 00:26:08,155
Stop torturing yourself, okay?

407
00:26:09,955 --> 00:26:11,195
There's another set.

408
00:26:12,915 --> 00:26:14,155
Take a break.

409
00:26:24,355 --> 00:26:25,419
Take a break.

410
00:26:38,034 --> 00:26:39,395
Try this one.

411
00:26:39,395 --> 00:26:40,754
Squeezing it is particularly stress-relieving.

412
00:26:40,754 --> 00:26:42,794
It's much more useful
than other stress-relief toys.

413
00:26:42,794 --> 00:26:44,554
And you can even eat it after playing with it

414
00:26:44,554 --> 00:26:45,579
to make the best use of it.

415
00:26:46,834 --> 00:26:47,883
Just like this.

416
00:26:48,834 --> 00:26:49,835
Try it.

417
00:26:53,635 --> 00:26:54,635
Like this.

418
00:27:02,435 --> 00:27:03,435
How is it?

419
00:27:04,754 --> 00:27:05,803
Not bad.

420
00:27:14,554 --> 00:27:15,554
You know

421
00:27:16,514 --> 00:27:17,515
I got suspended from training?

422
00:27:24,314 --> 00:27:25,323
I'm fine.

423
00:27:27,395 --> 00:27:28,635
Although I can't use live ammunition,

424
00:27:29,875 --> 00:27:32,043
Coach Lei has set a new plan for me.

425
00:27:32,594 --> 00:27:33,594
I won't be left behind.

426
00:27:35,115 --> 00:27:36,274
As for the provincial team training,

427
00:27:37,475 --> 00:27:38,514
there will be opportunities in the future.

428
00:27:43,074 --> 00:27:44,075
Give it to me.

429
00:27:48,994 --> 00:27:49,995
Stretch out your hand.

430
00:27:54,074 --> 00:27:56,554
Enjoy the result of your venting.

431
00:27:57,834 --> 00:28:00,635
If you feel it's not enough,
let's go to an amusement park one day

432
00:28:00,635 --> 00:28:03,195
and shoot all the balloons
at the balloon stand.

433
00:28:06,195 --> 00:28:07,234
Enough.

434
00:28:15,675 --> 00:28:16,683
Not bad.

435
00:28:30,514 --> 00:28:31,875
What are you going to do

436
00:28:32,675 --> 00:28:33,915
with Nie Xinghe?

437
00:28:39,435 --> 00:28:40,514
Previously,

438
00:28:40,514 --> 00:28:41,715
I was suspended from school for hitting him.

439
00:28:42,554 --> 00:28:43,595
This is a fact.

440
00:28:44,794 --> 00:28:46,355
But even now, I don't regret it.

441
00:28:48,594 --> 00:28:49,754
No matter the result,

442
00:28:50,395 --> 00:28:51,875
I can accept it.

443
00:28:51,875 --> 00:28:53,074
Since I've decided to look forward,

444
00:28:54,234 --> 00:28:56,115
I don't want to have any entanglement
with him anymore.

445
00:29:01,155 --> 00:29:02,435
This is the right decision.

446
00:29:03,675 --> 00:29:06,034
But it's too forgiving
to let him off so easily.

447
00:29:13,355 --> 00:29:14,715
Do you want

448
00:29:14,715 --> 00:29:15,723
to try this too?

449
00:29:18,554 --> 00:29:19,787
Go to train.

450
00:29:20,314 --> 00:29:21,994
I supervise you for Coach Lei today.

451
00:29:53,314 --> 00:29:54,315
Shen Juan,

452
00:29:56,155 --> 00:29:57,395
I heard you were suspended from training.

453
00:29:58,034 --> 00:29:59,395
Why are you still so diligent?

454
00:30:00,915 --> 00:30:03,475
Don't you still have the illusion

455
00:30:04,195 --> 00:30:05,994
that you can turn the tide?

456
00:30:11,395 --> 00:30:12,754
How is it?

457
00:30:12,754 --> 00:30:14,675
Do you like the big gift I sent you?

458
00:30:15,475 --> 00:30:18,435
If you feel it's not enough, I can add more.

459
00:30:26,994 --> 00:30:29,155
Don't waste your effort
thinking about these boring things.

460
00:30:30,034 --> 00:30:31,155
I know what you want to do.

461
00:30:32,155 --> 00:30:33,314
I won't let you succeed.

462
00:30:35,355 --> 00:30:36,594
So what do you want to do?

463
00:30:37,875 --> 00:30:39,034
To hit me again?

464
00:30:44,834 --> 00:30:46,274
I'm not the same person I was three years ago.

465
00:30:47,435 --> 00:30:48,675
I won't take the same old path.

466
00:30:49,514 --> 00:30:51,834
It's okay if you want to stay in the past,

467
00:30:53,074 --> 00:30:54,074
but I don't have time to play with you.

468
00:31:10,074 --> 00:31:11,115
Coach Lei,

469
00:31:11,994 --> 00:31:13,034
may I ask you

470
00:31:13,675 --> 00:31:14,754
for a favor?

471
00:31:18,514 --> 00:31:19,563
How is Juan doing?

472
00:31:20,195 --> 00:31:21,554
I've been to the training field to see him.

473
00:31:21,554 --> 00:31:22,794
He looks okay.

474
00:31:22,794 --> 00:31:23,875
Just that he's suspended from training

475
00:31:23,875 --> 00:31:24,955
for an unknown period.

476
00:31:25,554 --> 00:31:28,594
Nie Xinghe is a troublemaker.

477
00:31:28,594 --> 00:31:31,395
I guess Shen Juan was going to let him go,

478
00:31:31,395 --> 00:31:33,707
but he went to the university
and provoked Shen Juan with words.

479
00:31:34,274 --> 00:31:35,955
He even had the face to go to see Shen Juan?

480
00:31:36,794 --> 00:31:38,514
What does Nie Xinghe really want to do?

481
00:31:38,514 --> 00:31:39,955
I think if you can't bear it, then don't.

482
00:31:40,834 --> 00:31:42,715
Shen Juan's magnanimous,
so he's letting him off.

483
00:31:43,314 --> 00:31:44,675
But this thing can't pass in my book.

484
00:31:45,314 --> 00:31:47,554
I'm afraid
if we don't give him a bit of a lesson,

485
00:31:47,554 --> 00:31:49,074
he won't stop harassing Shen Juan every day.

486
00:31:50,274 --> 00:31:51,371
What do you want to do?

487
00:31:52,875 --> 00:31:54,395
Either don't strike at all

488
00:31:54,395 --> 00:31:55,955
or if you strike, you must strike hard.

489
00:31:56,875 --> 00:31:58,834
Let's first figure out
what Nie Xinghe is really up to.

490
00:31:58,834 --> 00:32:00,115
I don't believe we can't find his weak spot.

491
00:32:00,834 --> 00:32:01,915
Let me tell you.

492
00:32:01,915 --> 00:32:03,834
Nie Xinghe is very despicable.

493
00:32:03,834 --> 00:32:05,034
He must have done a lot of bad things.

494
00:32:05,794 --> 00:32:06,859
Investigate him.

495
00:32:16,034 --> 00:32:18,554
Nie Xinghe opened a Qinghe Art Studio

496
00:32:20,675 --> 00:32:21,875
located at the silverware store.

497
00:32:22,475 --> 00:32:24,794
He even had the nerve to open an online store
under the name of our store.

498
00:32:24,794 --> 00:32:25,955
Does he have any shame?

499
00:32:27,715 --> 00:32:28,834
This is too much.

500
00:32:32,234 --> 00:32:33,594
I know what to do now.

501
00:32:52,355 --> 00:32:54,074
I've spoken to the school authorities
about your request.

502
00:32:54,915 --> 00:32:56,195
The Academic Affairs Office
agreed to your appeal.

503
00:32:56,915 --> 00:32:58,859
Tomorrow morning at ten o'clock
in the Academic Affairs Office meeting room.

504
00:32:58,859 --> 00:33:01,715
But time is tight. Go back and prepare well.

505
00:33:01,715 --> 00:33:02,754
Thank you, coach.

506
00:33:08,994 --> 00:33:09,994
Adjust your breath.

507
00:33:16,475 --> 00:33:18,355
Are you Shen Juan? Please sit down.

508
00:33:25,834 --> 00:33:26,859
Let's get started.

509
00:33:29,715 --> 00:33:31,195
You proposed

510
00:33:31,195 --> 00:33:32,754
this meeting,

511
00:33:32,754 --> 00:33:33,803
so you go ahead.

512
00:33:37,875 --> 00:33:40,074
Thank you for giving me this chance to appeal.

513
00:33:42,115 --> 00:33:43,955
The fight circulating online

514
00:33:45,834 --> 00:33:47,074
did happen.

515
00:33:50,675 --> 00:33:53,475
I am here today to prove

516
00:33:53,475 --> 00:33:54,507
my mental health.

517
00:33:55,395 --> 00:33:56,459
However,

518
00:33:57,195 --> 00:33:58,875
we still want to hear you

519
00:33:59,554 --> 00:34:01,834
explain in detail

520
00:34:01,834 --> 00:34:05,034
why you hit someone first.

521
00:34:23,155 --> 00:34:24,195
What are you here for?

522
00:34:26,234 --> 00:34:27,314
Surprised?

523
00:34:28,715 --> 00:34:29,771
Unexpected?

524
00:34:45,635 --> 00:34:46,794
What do you exactly want to do?

525
00:34:51,675 --> 00:34:53,355
After doing so many bad things,

526
00:34:53,355 --> 00:34:55,195
you have the audacity to put this photo
on the table.

527
00:34:58,034 --> 00:34:59,034
I understand now.

528
00:34:59,834 --> 00:35:01,675
Shen Juan himself doesn't dare to face me,

529
00:35:02,274 --> 00:35:03,475
so he found you

530
00:35:03,994 --> 00:35:05,074
to stand up for him.

531
00:35:06,754 --> 00:35:07,787
You're overthinking.

532
00:35:08,475 --> 00:35:10,074
Shen Juan doesn't even know about this.

533
00:35:10,794 --> 00:35:12,395
I came here

534
00:35:12,395 --> 00:35:14,554
because we still have an old score to settle.

535
00:35:22,195 --> 00:35:24,635
You sent the disciplinary notice
of Shen Juan to my mom, right?

536
00:35:25,314 --> 00:35:26,594
What were you playing at?

537
00:35:29,435 --> 00:35:30,603
I was just trying to help.

538
00:35:31,115 --> 00:35:32,554
I kindly reminded your mom

539
00:35:33,594 --> 00:35:35,355
to see clearly as soon as possible

540
00:35:35,355 --> 00:35:37,955
the kind of person her daughter was dating

541
00:35:38,554 --> 00:35:40,794
so that she would not be deceived

542
00:35:40,794 --> 00:35:43,715
or see her own daughter sinking into misery.

543
00:35:44,395 --> 00:35:46,635
Shen Juan is upright and innocent.

544
00:35:46,635 --> 00:35:48,155
I know him best.

545
00:35:48,155 --> 00:35:49,355
I don't need you to distort the truth.

546
00:35:50,355 --> 00:35:53,594
As for you, you're like a rat in the sewer,

547
00:35:53,594 --> 00:35:56,314
only capable of doing bad things
behind people's backs. How disgusting.

548
00:35:57,234 --> 00:35:58,715
Shen Juan is upright and innocent.

549
00:36:00,475 --> 00:36:02,059
Then who was the one who killed my master?

550
00:36:02,635 --> 00:36:03,994
And who was the one who hit me?

551
00:36:04,594 --> 00:36:05,963
I told everyone what he did.

552
00:36:05,963 --> 00:36:07,034
What did I do wrong?

553
00:36:17,122 --> 00:36:19,281
<i>All the tenderness I have for this world</i>

554
00:36:19,281 --> 00:36:21,321
<i>comes from your blatant favoritism.</i>

555
00:36:22,321 --> 00:36:24,602
<i>When you are not treated gently by this world,</i>

556
00:36:24,602 --> 00:36:26,441
<i>I will stand up without hesitation.</i>

557
00:36:26,441 --> 00:36:28,841
<i>I will prove to the world in my way</i>

558
00:36:28,841 --> 00:36:30,522
<i>that you are the boy with a warm heart</i>

559
00:36:30,522 --> 00:36:32,441
<i>and bright talent.</i>

560
00:36:47,319 --> 00:36:51,863
<i>♫ Love sprouts in my palm ♫</i>

561
00:36:53,175 --> 00:36:57,015
<i>♫ Yet worried linger within my eyes ♫</i>

562
00:36:58,807 --> 00:37:03,383
<i>♫ Our story hasn't ended ♫</i>

563
00:37:04,311 --> 00:37:07,991
<i>♫ So where are we now ♫</i>

564
00:37:09,815 --> 00:37:15,479
<i>♫ I want to hug you so badly ♫</i>

565
00:37:15,479 --> 00:37:19,543
<i>♫ I want to become better with you ♫</i>

566
00:37:20,791 --> 00:37:25,655
<i>♫ The youth we shared ♫</i>

567
00:37:25,655 --> 00:37:31,703
<i>♫ Turned into a rainbow within my heart ♫</i>

568
00:37:32,215 --> 00:37:37,783
<i>♫ I really want to warm you ♫</i>

569
00:37:37,783 --> 00:37:39,671
<i>♫ I want to share with you ♫</i>

570
00:37:39,671 --> 00:37:44,343
<i>♫ The beauty of the world ♫</i>

571
00:37:45,227 --> 00:37:47,447
<i>♫ We promised ♫</i>

572
00:37:48,023 --> 00:37:53,719
<i>♫ To never be apart ♫</i>

573
00:37:54,455 --> 00:38:00,157
<i>♫ Do you want to hear me sing ♫</i>

574
00:38:00,157 --> 00:38:04,919
<i>♫ The wind chime swaying in my heart ♫</i>

575
00:38:05,463 --> 00:38:09,687
<i>♫ Is a wish ♫</i>

576
00:38:10,423 --> 00:38:16,311
<i>♫ I secretly made for you ♫</i>

577
00:38:16,855 --> 00:38:22,391
<i>♫ I want to plant ♫</i>

578
00:38:22,391 --> 00:38:24,279
<i>♫ A red maple forest ♫</i>

579
00:38:24,279 --> 00:38:28,887
<i>♫ To dye the whole mountain red ♫</i>

580
00:38:29,815 --> 00:38:32,055
<i>♫ The sky after the rain ♫</i>

581
00:38:32,695 --> 00:38:37,623
<i>♫ Was painted by our brilliant dreams ♫</i>

582
00:38:44,503 --> 00:38:49,271
<i>♫ Time is a flower of dream ♫</i>

583
00:38:50,103 --> 00:38:55,189
<i>♫ You've already collected it ♫</i>

584
00:38:56,119 --> 00:39:00,119
<i>♫ When we all become better ♫</i>

585
00:39:01,591 --> 00:39:05,719
<i>♫ We'll see the best of the world together ♫</i>
