00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:00,079
What's wrong? Who got you down?

20
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:05,879
Is Meng Weiguo here? I want to talk to him.

21
00:02:07,239 --> 00:02:10,240
He's in. Come in first. I'll call him for you.

22
00:02:18,439 --> 00:02:19,759
What's the matter

23
00:02:20,479 --> 00:02:21,680
with you so early in the morning?

24
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:25,719
And you called me here to tell me?

25
00:02:27,199 --> 00:02:30,840
Dad, I don't want to go back to Huaicheng.

26
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,199
Can I stay here?

27
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,479
Weren't you always clamoring to go back?

28
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,560
What happened?

29
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,900
Your mom wants to take you away now,

30
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:40,039
but you don't want to leave?

31
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,579
That was because I wasn't used to it

32
00:02:43,579 --> 00:02:44,800
when I just came here.

33
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Now I really don't want to leave.

34
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:51,759
Lin Yujing,

35
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:56,159
you're like the weather here,
changing all the time.

36
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,420
You've only been here a few months,

37
00:02:58,420 --> 00:02:59,640
and you're already attached?

38
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:01,840
I don't see you home much.

39
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,660
I was immature before.

40
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:05,000
I was wrong.

41
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,080
I promise you from now on,

42
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,039
whatever you say goes, and I won't talk back.

43
00:03:08,599 --> 00:03:10,400
I won't cause you any more trouble.

44
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,000
I've never asked you for anything before.

45
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:20,439
Just this once, can you let me stay?

46
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,679
You know your mother,

47
00:03:25,679 --> 00:03:26,840
don't you?

48
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,840
Once she decides,

49
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,080
I can't stop.

50
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:32,920
It's no use asking for my help in this matter.

51
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:33,940
I can't help you.

52
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:35,080
How is that possible?

53
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,680
No matter what, you're still my dad.

54
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,839
You have the right to keep me

55
00:03:39,839 --> 00:03:41,760
if you want.

56
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,280
Actually, I don't really have the right.

57
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,039
I've already signed.

58
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:46,960
It's too late to say anything now.

59
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,059
What's the use of looking at me?

60
00:03:54,059 --> 00:03:56,320
Wasn't it your fault in the first place?

61
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:58,000
You didn't want to live in this house.

62
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,960
Look how much trouble you've caused me.

63
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:04,160
Besides,

64
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,919
your mother wants to take you back now.

65
00:04:06,439 --> 00:04:08,159
Isn't this what you wanted at first?

66
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,120
I'm really stupid.

67
00:04:15,039 --> 00:04:17,040
How could I think of asking you?

68
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:19,960
What do you mean by that?

69
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:21,079
It means nothing.

70
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,839
You just don't want me.

71
00:04:25,279 --> 00:04:27,040
Before, you took me in because my mom asked.

72
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,319
Now, you're driving me away because she wants.

73
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:32,600
You always blame everything on my mom.

74
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,660
No wonder you can never hold your head up
in front of her.

75
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:37,199
Because you're just a spineless man.

76
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,220
Get out.

77
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:42,800
Get as far away as you can.

78
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,880
Lin Yujing.

79
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:34,880
You--

80
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:35,959
I'm fine.

81
00:05:38,199 --> 00:05:40,560
I didn't have much hope to begin with.

82
00:05:41,839 --> 00:05:43,120
I just wanted to try.

83
00:05:43,639 --> 00:05:44,839
What if, right?

84
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:50,439
But it's still the same.

85
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,560
The law stipulates

86
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:02,480
that parents have the duty
to raise, educate and protect their children.

87
00:06:03,319 --> 00:06:04,920
But the law can't give every child

88
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,519
a pair of responsible parents.

89
00:06:07,079 --> 00:06:08,959
As a child, the only thing you can do

90
00:06:09,519 --> 00:06:11,839
is adapt to the environment and grow up.

91
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:22,680
Don't be disheartened.
There will always be a solution.

92
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:26,460
Bowing to people you don't want to bow to

93
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:27,800
requires great courage.

94
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:31,759
Lin Yujing, you've done a great job.

95
00:06:36,399 --> 00:06:38,000
I wish you were my brother.

96
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,199
In the legal sense, I am your brother.

97
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,800
Alright, deal.

98
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:49,680
If anything happens in the future,
you've got my back.

99
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,408
Yes, I've got yours.

100
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,519
The bus is here. I'm leaving.

101
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:10,140
Where are you going? Let me walk you.

102
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:11,879
No need. It's just two stops away.

103
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:37,459

104
00:08:37,459 --> 00:08:39,560

00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:42,240

110
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:00,580
<i>No one would live in it even if you paid them.</i>

111
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:01,719
<i>What's wrong with this house?</i>

112
00:09:01,719 --> 00:09:03,420
<i>Yeah, what's wrong with our house?</i>

113
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:04,560
<i>It is filthy.</i>

114
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:05,599
<i>The rats are bigger than cats,</i>

115
00:09:05,599 --> 00:09:06,599
<i>and they're not afraid of people.</i>

116
00:09:06,599 --> 00:09:07,679
<i>Be careful.</i>

117
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,320
<i>You want to change the silverware shop
into a DIY handcraft shop?</i>

118
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:16,440
<i>I think it's worth a try.</i>

119
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,000

120
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,279
<i>Do you still want your sneakers?</i>

121
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:49,240
Hungry? Wait a moment.

122
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,679
I really envy you.

123
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,840
When you're hungry,
you have canned food to eat.

124
00:10:06,879 --> 00:10:08,600
When you're tired, you have a place to go.

125
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,799
I'm leaving here.

126
00:10:36,759 --> 00:10:38,360
But I don't want to leave you.

127
00:10:43,759 --> 00:10:44,960
I don't want to.

The patient's physical indicators

130
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,660
We need to strengthen daily care.

131
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:58,720
Pay special attention at night
and check regularly.

132
00:10:59,799 --> 00:11:00,820
Dr. Gu,

133
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:02,080
is there anything wrong with my uncle?

134
00:11:02,679 --> 00:11:04,080
Don't worry.

135
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,620
His vital signs have been unstable these days.

136
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:08,440
We have arranged a comprehensive examination.

137
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,039
Let's wait
until the examination report comes out.

138
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:17,639
Shen Juan, is it almost time
for the final exams?

139
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:20,560
You go back and prepare well.

140
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:21,719
I'm here.

141
00:11:21,719 --> 00:11:23,960
If anything happens,
I'll notify you immediately.

142
00:11:24,919 --> 00:11:27,159

Let me tell you.

149
00:13:47,979 --> 00:13:49,520
The escape room I went to that day.

150
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:51,539
Really, it's unimaginable

151
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:53,639
and indescribable.

152
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,320
I just walked to the corner.

153
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:59,340
It was pitch black,
and I couldn't see my fingers.

154
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:00,352
Suddenly,

155
00:14:02,279 --> 00:14:04,480
the girl next to me was shaking with fear.

156
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,739
I wasn't scared at all.

157
00:14:05,739 --> 00:14:07,180
Really?

158
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:09,480
I think you're exaggerating.

159
00:14:10,519 --> 00:14:12,659
Lin Yujing, did you just hear

160
00:14:12,659 --> 00:14:14,559
the big lie that Li Lin was telling?

161
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:16,399
I didn't lie.

162
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,200
What's wrong? Not feeling well?

163
00:14:24,919 --> 00:14:27,480
Why has Shen Juan been absent
from class lately?

164
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:29,159
Isn't it almost time for the final exams?

165
00:14:30,559 --> 00:14:31,819
The bell is ringing. Go.

166
00:14:31,819 --> 00:14:33,080
Class is starting. Go.

167
00:14:37,759 --> 00:14:40,200
Everyone, self-study for this class.

168
00:14:40,759 --> 00:14:42,000
Prepare well for the final exams.

169
00:14:44,799 --> 00:14:47,519
Lin Yujing, come with me.

170
00:14:53,312 --> 00:14:54,440
Sit.

171
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:15,960
Your mom just called me.

172
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:20,500
She said she'd transfer you back

173
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:22,200
after the final exams this semester.

174
00:15:23,799 --> 00:15:24,919
Do you know about this?

175
00:15:31,399 --> 00:15:32,600
This is

176
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,759
a bit sudden.

177
00:15:35,399 --> 00:15:36,720
At the last parent-teacher meeting,

178
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:40,480
I told your mom you were doing very well

179
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:43,360
and that you could definitely enter
a good university.

180
00:15:44,919 --> 00:15:47,919
I didn't expect you to transfer so soon.

181
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,879
I haven't even had a good chat with you.

182
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,039
Please don't say that.

183
00:15:56,039 --> 00:15:57,400
This semester,

184
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:58,760
you've been very good to me.

185
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:00,679
I've always wanted to say thank you.

186
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,208
Lin Yujing,

187
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:08,399
actually,

188
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,480
I've always thought highly of you.

189
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:13,539
You're very smart

190
00:16:13,539 --> 00:16:14,600
and very sensible.

191
00:16:15,919 --> 00:16:17,080
I also know a bit

192
00:16:17,639 --> 00:16:18,879
about your family situation.

193
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,659
You've always been a child

194
00:16:21,659 --> 00:16:22,840
with a lot of ideas.

195
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:25,159
Transferring schools
will have some impact on you.

196
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:29,080
But you need to understand

197
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,839
given your age,

198
00:16:30,839 --> 00:16:32,380
it's not yet time

199
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:33,720
to put your ideas into practice.

200
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,559
I want to tell you.

201
00:16:40,559 --> 00:16:42,600
Since you can't stop your parents' decision,

202
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,799
then don't think too much about it.

203
00:16:45,879 --> 00:16:47,480
Focus on your studies.

204
00:16:48,014 --> 00:16:51,562
<i>♫ When a ray of light shines in my life ♫</i>

205
00:16:51,562 --> 00:16:54,947
<i>♫It lights up the direction
where my heart follows ♫</i>

206
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,380
<i>Focus on your studies.</i>

207
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:01,420
<i>Hibernate, enrich yourself</i>

208
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:02,679
<i>and accumulate strength.</i>

209
00:17:03,639 --> 00:17:05,720
<i>The college entrance examination
will give you the opportunity to choose.</i>

210
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:09,160
<i>Once you cross this mountain,</i>

211
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:11,839
<i>you will see</i>

212
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:16,519
<i>these problems are not problems anymore.</i>

213
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:32,992
What happened?

214
00:17:36,319 --> 00:17:38,119
Why haven't you been coming to class lately?

215
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:43,000
I took a new order,

216
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,559
and the client wants it urgently.

217
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:49,280
No matter how busy you are, you need to rest.

218
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:50,559
Final exams are coming up.

219
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,220
How long have we known each other?

220
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:58,539
I think we met for the first time

221
00:17:58,539 --> 00:17:59,720
a week before school started.

222
00:18:00,359 --> 00:18:01,440
Taking into account

223
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,480
the exams and the tutoring classes,
there are ten days left in this semester.

224
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:05,960
We've known each other for a semester.

225
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:09,856
What's wrong?

226
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:13,039
Nothing.

227
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:15,920
Just sighing at how fast time flies.

228
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:17,720
In the blink of an eye, half a year has passed.

229
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:21,880
Do you think
we will be like this in the future?

230
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:25,360
In a flash, we'll take
the college entrance exam, graduate

231
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:28,720
and then enter university together.

232
00:18:32,576 --> 00:18:33,728
Maybe.

233
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,160
At that time,

234
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,640
I won't choose the same major as you.

235
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:41,536
Why?

236
00:18:43,319 --> 00:18:44,319
I want to be number one.

237
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,880
I don't want to be always two points
behind someone

238
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,359
and look at that person's smug face.

239
00:18:51,392 --> 00:18:52,759
Do I?

240
00:18:56,599 --> 00:18:58,340
When that time comes,

241
00:18:58,340 --> 00:19:00,480
I will live as I please,

242
00:19:01,079 --> 00:19:02,500
do whatever I want

243
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:04,200
and see whoever I want,

244
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:09,400
just like that bird,

245
00:19:11,079 --> 00:19:12,200
free and easy.

246
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:20,279
<i>♫ Time is a flower of dream ♫</i>

247
00:19:20,279 --> 00:19:24,000

00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:32,119

<i>As long as we keep each other in our hearts,
we will meet again.</i>

252
00:19:51,759 --> 00:19:55,519
<i>You're right. We will meet again.</i>

253
00:19:56,440 --> 00:20:00,042

00:20:02,072 --> 00:20:07,456

00:20:14,759 --> 00:20:17,260
Everyone, please answer the paper carefully.

257
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:19,360
The test time is 90 minutes.

258
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,680
No whispering.

259
00:20:23,926 --> 00:20:29,664
<i>♫ I really want to warm you ♫</i>

260
00:20:29,664 --> 00:20:31,648

<i>♫ Was painted by our brilliant dreams ♫</i>

278
00:22:13,279 --> 00:22:14,480
You keep watching me.

279
00:22:15,079 --> 00:22:16,240
Afraid I'll take something from your house?

280
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,759
I didn't want you to live here before,

281
00:22:21,279 --> 00:22:22,279
but now I surprisingly don't want you

282
00:22:23,319 --> 00:22:24,544
to leave either.

283
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:27,559
Isn't it a bit unbelievable?

284
00:22:38,519 --> 00:22:40,240
You should be happy that I'm leaving.

285
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:42,279
No one will bother you in the future.

286
00:22:45,319 --> 00:22:47,000
Before you leave,
is there anything you want to say?

287
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,920
Thank Aunt Guan for me.

288
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:53,359
Thank her for her care during this time.

289
00:22:56,128 --> 00:22:57,400
Anything else?

290
00:22:58,688 --> 00:22:59,759
No, that's all.

291
00:23:01,536 --> 00:23:02,720
Lin Yujing,

292
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:05,599
I've helped you a lot
during these months in Pucheng, haven't I?

293
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:08,400
You're so petty.

294
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,559
Don't worry. I remember it all.

295
00:23:11,079 --> 00:23:12,500
What's the use of remembering?

296
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:14,000
You have to repay me in kind.

297
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Fine, Fu Mingxiu.

298
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,060
What's up with you?

299
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:18,920
You haven't even left yet,
and you're already calling me my full name.

300
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:20,199
So, tell me.

301
00:23:20,199 --> 00:23:21,200
How do you want me to repay you?

302
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,680
I have to think about it.
Keep that in mind first.

303
00:23:33,984 --> 00:23:35,400
Here you go.

304
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,219
You keep it.

305
00:23:40,219 --> 00:23:41,440
Didn't you say you wanted to repay me?

306
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:43,759
I'll wait for the day.

307
00:23:48,079 --> 00:23:49,559
Then you'll have to wait for a long time.

308
00:23:54,839 --> 00:23:56,799
Let's go. I'll take you back to school.

309
00:24:39,119 --> 00:24:40,580
Don't cry.

310
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:42,240
We can still use WeChat, right?

311
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,759
We can chat through it in the future.

312
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:56,180
This is for you. It's my lucky pen.

313
00:24:56,180 --> 00:24:58,120
Every time I use it, I get high scores.

314
00:24:58,120 --> 00:24:59,639
You can use it for your exams.

315
00:24:59,639 --> 00:25:01,519
Take it easy, and I'm sure you'll do well.

316
00:25:03,799 --> 00:25:04,839
Don't cry.

317
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:14,599
Xu Ruyi, stop crying.

318
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:17,279
It's not like we'll never see each other again.

319
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:21,700
This just shows how strong our friendship is.
You don't understand.

320
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:22,960
How do I not understand?

321
00:25:23,799 --> 00:25:25,599
She's not the only roommate you have.

322
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:28,960
So what do you want me to give you?

323
00:25:32,759 --> 00:25:34,960
Just help me keep some things secret.

324
00:25:36,519 --> 00:25:38,400
Alright.

325
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,039
Then be nicer to Xu Ruyi.

326
00:25:40,039 --> 00:25:41,099
Don't always behave in ways

327
00:25:41,099 --> 00:25:43,759
that make people misunderstand,
and you clearly--

328
00:25:44,359 --> 00:25:46,279
Alright, are you leaving or not?

329
00:25:48,256 --> 00:25:49,640
Are you leaving or not?

330
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,359
- I haven't taken my bag yet.
- Are you?

331
00:26:27,799 --> 00:26:29,039
Excuse me.

332
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:37,600
Why aren't Juan and Lin Yujing's names
in the first column?

333
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:38,880
Did they make a mistake?

334
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,960
Impossible. Are your eyes not working?

335
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:57,000
They failed.

336
00:26:57,640 --> 00:27:00,200
<i>[Shen Juan Lin Yujing]</i>
Is this still the same formidable pair?

337
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:02,680
I suspect they made a mistake with the scores.

338
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:05,600
With their usual grades,
how could they possibly fail?

339
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,759
I even passed.

340
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,720
Let's go ask them.

00:27:17,177 --> 00:27:18,432

<i>I know you're Lin Yujing.</i>

346
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,900
Why are you still dawdling here?

347
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:08,679
The final exam results are out.

348
00:28:08,679 --> 00:28:10,440
You and Juan failed.

349
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:12,120
There must be a problem with these grades.

350
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:14,180
Yeah, go ask the teacher now.

351
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:15,900
It says you two didn't pass
any of the subjects.

352
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:17,120
How is that possible?

353
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:18,720
Go ask the teacher.

354
00:28:20,759 --> 00:28:23,880
Say something. What happened?

355
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:30,840
The final exam results are out.

356
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:34,000
Our class didn't do very well this time.

357
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,200
I know

358
00:28:35,799 --> 00:28:37,680

it's basically a review

364

534
00:42:17,980 --> 00:42:19,280
In this case,

535
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:21,080
many families don't want the patient
to continue to suffer

536
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:22,720
and prefer to choose conservative treatment.

537
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:24,440
Give up all pathological treatments,

538
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:27,280
and the subsequent medication
is also aimed at alleviating pain.

539
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:29,800
If we choose the second one,
how long can he last?

540
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:32,320
At most three months.

541
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:35,920
This is a consent form
for discontinuing treatment.

542
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:38,639
Please consider it.

543
00:42:40,639 --> 00:42:42,400
Shen, why are you here?

544
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:54,119
<i>It's the same city and streets.</i>

545
00:42:55,119 --> 00:42:57,280
<i>I used to find them noisy,</i>

546
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:59,800
<i>but now, I'm filled with nostalgia.</i>

547
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:03,360
<i>When we can't change it yet,</i>

548
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:08,320
<i>all we can do is hold on to the beauty
in front of us.</i>

549
00:43:20,420 --> 00:43:24,964
<i>♫ Love sprouts in my palm ♫</i>

550
00:43:26,276 --> 00:43:30,116
<i>♫ Yet worried linger within my eyes ♫</i>

551
00:43:31,908 --> 00:43:36,484
<i>♫ Our story hasn't ended ♫</i>

552
00:43:37,412 --> 00:43:41,092
<i>♫ So where are we now ♫</i>

553
00:43:42,916 --> 00:43:48,580
<i>♫ I want to hug you so badly ♫</i>

554
00:43:48,580 --> 00:43:52,644
<i>♫ I want to become better with you ♫</i>

555
00:43:53,892 --> 00:43:58,756
<i>♫ The youth we shared ♫</i>

556
00:43:58,756 --> 00:44:04,804
<i>♫ Turned into a rainbow within my heart ♫</i>

557
00:44:05,316 --> 00:44:10,884
<i>♫ I really want to warm you ♫</i>

558
00:44:10,884 --> 00:44:12,772
<i>♫ I want to share with you ♫</i>

559
00:44:12,772 --> 00:44:17,444
<i>♫ The beauty of the world ♫</i>

560
00:44:18,328 --> 00:44:20,548
<i>♫ We promised ♫</i>

561
00:44:21,124 --> 00:44:26,820
<i>♫ To never be apart ♫</i>

562
00:44:27,556 --> 00:44:33,258
<i>♫ Do you want to hear me sing ♫</i>

563
00:44:33,258 --> 00:44:38,020
<i>♫ The wind chime swaying in my heart ♫</i>

564
00:44:38,564 --> 00:44:42,788
<i>♫ Is a wish ♫</i>

565
00:44:43,524 --> 00:44:49,412
<i>♫ I secretly made for you ♫</i>

566
00:44:49,956 --> 00:44:55,492
<i>♫ I want to plant ♫</i>

567
00:44:55,492 --> 00:44:57,380
<i>♫ A red maple forest ♫</i>

568
00:44:57,380 --> 00:45:01,988
<i>♫ To dye the whole mountain red ♫</i>

569
00:45:02,916 --> 00:45:05,156
<i>♫ The sky after the rain ♫</i>

570
00:45:05,796 --> 00:45:10,724
<i>♫ Was painted by our brilliant dreams ♫</i>

571
00:45:17,604 --> 00:45:22,372
<i>♫ Time is a flower of dream ♫</i>

572
00:45:23,204 --> 00:45:28,290
<i>♫ You've already collected it ♫</i>

573
00:45:29,220 --> 00:45:33,220
<i>♫ When we all become better ♫</i>

574
00:45:34,692 --> 00:45:38,820
<i>♫ We'll see the best of the world together ♫</i>
