00:01:34,272 --> 00:01:35,392
Lin Yujing!

20
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,480
This way! Your mom is here.

21
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,280
This is…

22
00:01:50,464 --> 00:01:51,616
Your mom?

23
00:02:00,672 --> 00:02:01,728
Why are you here?

24
00:02:01,728 --> 00:02:03,040
To check on you, of course.

25
00:02:04,448 --> 00:02:05,888
We're about to hold a parents' meeting.

26
00:02:05,888 --> 00:02:08,840
Since your mom's here,
I'll talk with her about your situation.

27
00:02:12,128 --> 00:02:13,360
Lin Yujing,

28
00:02:13,984 --> 00:02:15,808
didn't you ask me
to come to the parents' meeting?

29
00:02:16,416 --> 00:02:17,759
Who is this?

30
00:02:19,392 --> 00:02:20,400
I am her brother.

31
00:02:27,104 --> 00:02:28,199
Where's your seat?

32
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:32,064
The parents' meeting is about to start.

33
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:33,984
Well, you should go inside.

34
00:02:33,984 --> 00:02:36,032
We'll talk about the rest after the meeting.

35
00:02:36,736 --> 00:02:37,760
Okay?

36
00:02:51,104 --> 00:02:54,880
I'd like to talk about
our new transfer student,

37
00:02:55,706 --> 00:02:56,768
Lin Yujing.

38
00:02:57,625 --> 00:03:00,384
She is a role model for our class.

39
00:03:00,384 --> 00:03:02,176
Not only does she have good grades,

40
00:03:02,176 --> 00:03:03,936
but she also motivates her peers

41
00:03:03,936 --> 00:03:05,824
to progress and improve together.

42
00:03:06,426 --> 00:03:07,776
Everyone likes her a lot.

43
00:03:13,505 --> 00:03:14,752
Who is that woman?

44
00:03:15,546 --> 00:03:16,768
She looks pretty good.

45
00:03:17,665 --> 00:03:20,266
Why does she look like…

46
00:03:20,785 --> 00:03:22,505
Did you ask both of your parents to come over?

47
00:03:23,945 --> 00:03:25,626
Hey! Why did you hit me?

48
00:03:25,626 --> 00:03:26,746
Can you be quiet?

49
00:03:49,266 --> 00:03:50,845
<i>Didn't we agree?</i>

50
00:03:50,845 --> 00:03:52,986
<i>You'll stay in Pucheng for a few days.</i>

51
00:03:54,706 --> 00:03:56,746
<i>You've always liked this bracelet, right?</i>

52
00:03:57,465 --> 00:03:58,586
<i>It's yours now.</i>

53
00:04:00,426 --> 00:04:03,385
<i>She's the one who did all of this.</i>

54
00:04:04,625 --> 00:04:05,984
<i>And she didn't let me tell you.</i>

55
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:09,145
<i>Yu, you'll stay with your dad for some days.</i>

56
00:04:09,145 --> 00:04:11,426
<i>So you tricked me into coming to Pucheng.</i>

57
00:04:11,426 --> 00:04:13,066
<i>You two planned it behind my back, right?</i>

58
00:04:13,066 --> 00:04:14,848
<i>I did this for your own good.</i>

59
00:04:15,746 --> 00:04:16,928
<i>You'll understand later.</i>

60
00:04:17,466 --> 00:04:19,705
<i>When you guys divorced,
you said you wanted me to live with you.</i>

61
00:04:20,306 --> 00:04:21,825
<i>I thought you loved me.</i>

62
00:04:22,866 --> 00:04:24,106
<i>Now you also abandoned me.</i>

63
00:04:25,385 --> 00:04:27,065
<i>I'm completely homeless.</i>

64
00:04:36,825 --> 00:04:38,112
Your mom came here to see you.

65
00:04:39,585 --> 00:04:40,896
Aren't you happy?

66
00:04:47,226 --> 00:04:49,024
I didn't expect her to come suddenly.

67
00:04:49,786 --> 00:04:52,672
I thought she had abandoned me.

68
00:05:10,385 --> 00:05:11,392
How was it?

69
00:05:14,065 --> 00:05:15,392
You and your mom are quite alike.

70
00:05:16,065 --> 00:05:17,216
I didn't ask about her!

71
00:05:17,216 --> 00:05:18,368
I mean the parents' meeting.

72
00:05:20,825 --> 00:05:23,104
Your homeroom teacher spoke highly of you.

73
00:05:23,104 --> 00:05:24,800
Your mom is chatting with him inside.

74
00:05:26,466 --> 00:05:27,825
It seems like she cares about you a lot.

75
00:05:29,986 --> 00:05:31,306
So, I decided to come out.

76
00:05:31,306 --> 00:05:33,152
After all, I'm just an outsider.

77
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:36,672
Thanks, bro.

78
00:05:37,856 --> 00:05:39,232
Where's Shen Juan?

79
00:05:39,232 --> 00:05:40,608
Why isn't he with you?

80
00:05:40,608 --> 00:05:42,528
He already left. He had something to do.

81
00:05:43,546 --> 00:05:44,786
Alright, I'm leaving.

82
00:05:47,825 --> 00:05:49,986
Don't tell Meng Weiguo about today.

83
00:05:51,585 --> 00:05:52,926
What do I have to say to him?

84
00:05:52,926 --> 00:05:54,016
Bye.

85
00:05:59,746 --> 00:06:02,176
You don't need to worry about her study.

86
00:06:03,025 --> 00:06:04,480
Oh, there she is. I'll be leaving.

87
00:06:05,226 --> 00:06:06,720
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

88
00:06:14,176 --> 00:06:15,666
Look at your grades!

89
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:17,152
You only got
the second-highest score of your class.

90
00:06:17,696 --> 00:06:19,520
You were always the best in your class before.

91
00:06:20,746 --> 00:06:22,226
I also heard that you are now living on campus.

92
00:06:22,786 --> 00:06:24,544
How could Meng Weiguo treat you like this?

93
00:06:25,866 --> 00:06:27,584
I think I'm doing just fine.

94
00:06:28,185 --> 00:06:29,216
I'm enjoying my study,

95
00:06:29,216 --> 00:06:30,400
and I feel happy to live here.

96
00:06:31,168 --> 00:06:32,352
Is that so?

97
00:06:32,352 --> 00:06:33,792
Haven't you already abandoned me?

98
00:06:33,792 --> 00:06:35,025
Why do you still care?

99
00:06:37,265 --> 00:06:38,986
When did I abandon you?

100
00:06:39,705 --> 00:06:41,536
Then why did you let me live with Meng Weiguo?

101
00:06:41,536 --> 00:06:43,200
You haven't even cared about me for ages.

102
00:06:43,904 --> 00:06:45,504
I'm doing pretty well now.

103
00:06:45,504 --> 00:06:47,456
And I'm satisfied with my grades.

104
00:06:49,825 --> 00:06:51,840
Do you have to be so aggressive,

105
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:52,992
Lin Yujing?

106
00:06:52,992 --> 00:06:54,240
Are you done?

107
00:06:55,025 --> 00:06:56,306
May I leave, then?

108
00:06:57,746 --> 00:06:59,648
Thank you for coming.

109
00:06:59,648 --> 00:07:01,248
But honestly, it isn't necessary.

110
00:07:18,065 --> 00:07:19,424
Hello, who are you looking for?

111
00:07:19,424 --> 00:07:20,736
Lin Yujing.

112
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:23,296
Please come in.

113
00:07:37,696 --> 00:07:39,424
I've told your teacher.

114
00:07:39,424 --> 00:07:41,376
You'll stay with me for a few days.

115
00:07:42,848 --> 00:07:43,936
I won't.

116
00:07:43,936 --> 00:07:45,440
I just moved in here.

117
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,592
And I'm doing just fine.

118
00:07:46,592 --> 00:07:48,096
Pack your things now.

119
00:07:48,096 --> 00:07:49,248
I'll wait for you at the door.

120
00:07:49,906 --> 00:07:51,744
I said I won't!

121
00:07:57,705 --> 00:07:59,584
I'll give you twenty minutes.

122
00:07:59,584 --> 00:08:00,992
Hurry up and get packed.

123
00:08:12,065 --> 00:08:13,440
Are you okay?

124
00:08:15,424 --> 00:08:16,512
I'm fine.

125
00:08:56,746 --> 00:08:58,765
<i>Lin Yujing's mother suddenly came.</i>

126
00:08:58,765 --> 00:09:01,145
<i>She insisted on
asking Yujing to live with her for a few days.</i>

127
00:09:01,706 --> 00:09:03,246
<i>She didn't seem happy.</i>

128
00:09:03,246 --> 00:09:04,768
<i>I'm quite worried.</i>

129
00:09:15,648 --> 00:09:18,880
Sorry, the number you have dialed
is temporarily unavailable.

130
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,736
Please try again later.

131
00:09:24,192 --> 00:09:25,920
We'll stay here for a few days.

132
00:09:30,466 --> 00:09:31,744
How long?

133
00:09:31,744 --> 00:09:33,696
I have to go back to the dormitory.

134
00:09:36,866 --> 00:09:38,272
Who agreed to let you live on campus?

135
00:09:39,488 --> 00:09:40,926
I asked your teacher.

136
00:09:40,926 --> 00:09:43,328
It requires the consent of a guardian.

137
00:09:43,328 --> 00:09:44,544
My dad.

138
00:09:44,544 --> 00:09:45,952
Your dad?

139
00:09:47,466 --> 00:09:48,544
I also asked him.

140
00:09:49,265 --> 00:09:50,785
He never agreed to let you live on campus.

141
00:09:51,346 --> 00:09:52,768
You made the decision on your own.

142
00:09:54,625 --> 00:09:56,096
I earned enough money to pay for it.

143
00:09:56,096 --> 00:09:57,376
I feel happy living there.

144
00:09:58,025 --> 00:09:59,392
You earned money?

145
00:10:02,346 --> 00:10:04,064
Didn't Meng Weiguo give you money?

146
00:10:18,784 --> 00:10:21,206
Lin Yujing, I called you several times.

147
00:10:21,206 --> 00:10:22,496
Why didn't you answer?

148
00:10:22,496 --> 00:10:24,608
Do you think you have someone to back you up

149
00:10:24,608 --> 00:10:25,856
since your mother is back?

150
00:10:28,385 --> 00:10:29,856
Let me tell you.

151
00:10:29,856 --> 00:10:31,625
You're living with me now.

152
00:10:32,128 --> 00:10:33,152
I warn you.

153
00:10:33,152 --> 00:10:34,688
When you're with your mother,

154
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,286
you should know what to say

155
00:10:37,286 --> 00:10:38,720
and what not to say.

156
00:10:39,712 --> 00:10:40,736
What to say

157
00:10:40,736 --> 00:10:41,952
and what not to say?

158
00:10:41,952 --> 00:10:44,224
Explain your words, Meng Weiguo.

159
00:10:45,472 --> 00:10:47,306
I have nothing to say to you.

160
00:10:47,306 --> 00:10:48,646
We'll meet tomorrow.

161
00:10:48,646 --> 00:10:50,080
You have to explain to me.

162
00:10:55,584 --> 00:10:57,216
What has Meng Weiguo done to you?

163
00:11:10,025 --> 00:11:11,712
<i>I heard from Xu Ruyi.</i>

164
00:11:12,385 --> 00:11:14,048
<i>Your mother wants you
to live with her for a few days.</i>

165
00:11:15,776 --> 00:11:17,664
<i>I'll go back to my dorm tomorrow.</i>

166
00:11:19,385 --> 00:11:20,928
<i>Do you need help?</i>

167
00:11:23,008 --> 00:11:24,064
<i>No.</i>

168
00:11:28,608 --> 00:11:30,866
Mr. Zhang, I've received the contract.

169
00:11:33,568 --> 00:11:35,136
Thank you, Mr. Zhang.

170
00:11:53,216 --> 00:11:54,465
Hurry up! Hurry!

171
00:11:54,465 --> 00:11:55,680
Wait for me!

172
00:12:18,785 --> 00:12:20,000
Good morning, deskmate.

173
00:12:21,385 --> 00:12:22,688
Good morning, deskmate.

174
00:12:24,928 --> 00:12:26,826
My dad gave me some pocket money yesterday.

175
00:12:27,346 --> 00:12:28,640
Liu said,

176
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30,866
"Wang Yiyang did pretty well this semester."

177
00:12:30,866 --> 00:12:32,320
My old man was so happy.

178
00:12:34,016 --> 00:12:35,264
Your dad is so kind to you.

179
00:12:35,264 --> 00:12:36,352
As soon as I went back,

180
00:12:36,352 --> 00:12:38,365
my mom put a few goji berries in my cup

181
00:12:38,365 --> 00:12:39,936
and told me to do better next time.

182
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,746
Lin Yujing, what about you?

183
00:12:42,746 --> 00:12:44,960
Did your mom give you any reward?

184
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,624
Mind your own business.

185
00:12:46,624 --> 00:12:48,864
Hey, come on! We're so close.

186
00:12:48,864 --> 00:12:50,080
What can't you tell me about?

187
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,104
Turn around.

188
00:13:01,586 --> 00:13:04,512
Our last parents' meeting was very successful.

189
00:13:05,024 --> 00:13:06,066
Alas, don't bring that up.

190
00:13:06,066 --> 00:13:07,746
My dad scolded me when he got home.

191
00:13:08,505 --> 00:13:10,880
I know you've been studying hard.

192
00:13:12,466 --> 00:13:15,648
But you should also pay more attention
to communicating with your parents.

193
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,016
Okay?

194
00:13:18,016 --> 00:13:20,896
Okay.

195
00:13:21,425 --> 00:13:23,776
Alright, let's start the class.

196
00:13:45,824 --> 00:13:46,912
Have you eaten?

197
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:48,896
I'm not hungry.

198
00:13:58,706 --> 00:14:00,166
That doesn't seem right.

199
00:14:00,166 --> 00:14:01,920
Why did you buy peanuts?

200
00:14:05,346 --> 00:14:06,946
You told me before.

201
00:14:07,986 --> 00:14:09,106
No matter what happens,

202
00:14:09,986 --> 00:14:11,346
I still have to eat well.

203
00:14:18,665 --> 00:14:19,808
In the future,

204
00:14:20,385 --> 00:14:21,984
if there's something
you don't want to tell me about,

205
00:14:22,706 --> 00:14:23,712
you don't have to say it.

206
00:14:23,712 --> 00:14:25,248
I won't ask you, either.

207
00:14:25,248 --> 00:14:26,528
But you should never fool me.

208
00:14:28,746 --> 00:14:30,624
When have I ever fooled you?

209
00:14:31,586 --> 00:14:32,866
Whenever you felt guilty,

210
00:14:32,866 --> 00:14:34,186
you always sent that emoji.

211
00:14:37,024 --> 00:14:38,926
Well, my mom came so suddenly,

212
00:14:38,926 --> 00:14:40,608
so I can't quite accept the situation.

213
00:14:40,608 --> 00:14:42,656
I'll be fine in a few days. Don't worry.

214
00:15:10,826 --> 00:15:14,656
I didn't expect this place to be so formal.

215
00:15:15,168 --> 00:15:17,184
Don't overthink. I just finished a meeting.

216
00:15:18,464 --> 00:15:19,525
Just say what you need to say.

217
00:15:19,525 --> 00:15:21,920
Let me ask you. Why did you beat Yu?

218
00:15:23,296 --> 00:15:25,248
You can't imagine how she spoke to me.

219
00:15:25,248 --> 00:15:27,026
Do you know how much you've spoiled her?

220
00:15:27,026 --> 00:15:29,184
That's not an excuse. She's your daughter!

221
00:15:29,184 --> 00:15:31,008
You can't just beat her like that.

222
00:15:31,008 --> 00:15:32,385
Ever since she moved in with me

223
00:15:33,106 --> 00:15:34,326
she hasn't given me a moment's peace.

224
00:15:34,326 --> 00:15:35,840
She's always opposing me.

225
00:15:36,425 --> 00:15:39,104
Lin Zhi, are you instigating her
behind my back?

226
00:15:40,066 --> 00:15:41,408
Instigating? Me?

227
00:15:42,304 --> 00:15:43,648
Don't play dumb with me.

228
00:15:45,946 --> 00:15:47,808
If neither of us gave her money,

229
00:15:47,808 --> 00:15:49,696
how could she be able to live on campus?

230
00:15:52,505 --> 00:15:54,046
You didn't know about this?

231
00:15:54,046 --> 00:15:56,032
She earned it on her own.

232
00:15:56,586 --> 00:15:57,726
How did you discipline her?

233
00:15:57,726 --> 00:15:58,866
How did you look after her?

234
00:15:58,866 --> 00:15:59,905
How?

235
00:16:01,664 --> 00:16:04,672
I've topped up her campus card
and transportation card.

236
00:16:05,178 --> 00:16:06,432
It's enough for her to live on.

237
00:16:07,305 --> 00:16:08,785
She's already out of control without any money.

238
00:16:08,785 --> 00:16:09,792
What if she has enough money?

239
00:16:09,792 --> 00:16:11,106
What would she do?

240
00:16:11,106 --> 00:16:12,352
Money, money, money.

241
00:16:15,346 --> 00:16:17,166
You're still the same as before.

242
00:16:17,166 --> 00:16:18,946
After all these years,
you haven't changed at all.

243
00:16:20,672 --> 00:16:23,040
Lin Zhi, I-I don't want to argue with you.

244
00:16:23,866 --> 00:16:24,928
Just say it. What do you want?

245
00:16:26,066 --> 00:16:28,145
I asked you to come here for only one reason.

246
00:16:28,706 --> 00:16:30,826
I will take Yu back to Huaicheng.

247
00:16:51,145 --> 00:16:53,632
I heard your mom came to Pucheng.

248
00:16:54,986 --> 00:16:56,345
She asked me to stay with her for a few days.

249
00:16:56,345 --> 00:16:57,856
And she wants to negotiate with Meng Weiguo.

250
00:16:58,746 --> 00:17:00,928
She's not planning to take you back, is she?

251
00:17:02,305 --> 00:17:03,346
She can't.

252
00:17:05,626 --> 00:17:06,886
It's not that simple.

253
00:17:06,886 --> 00:17:08,000
Let's meet and talk about it.

254
00:17:16,146 --> 00:17:17,760
My mom told me something.

255
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:20,384
She said that
your mother sent you to your dad's

256
00:17:20,928 --> 00:17:22,208
because of some issues with her company.

257
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,792
I think she did it to protect you.

258
00:17:32,545 --> 00:17:35,104
But don't worry too much.

259
00:17:35,104 --> 00:17:36,448
I also heard that

260
00:17:36,448 --> 00:17:39,265
she has already found an investor in Huaicheng

261
00:17:59,392 --> 00:18:01,120
Did you send me here

262
00:18:01,825 --> 00:18:03,712
because your company was in trouble?

263
00:18:12,386 --> 00:18:13,666
Who told you that?

264
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:15,646
Meng Weiguo?

265
00:18:15,646 --> 00:18:16,896
Just tell me if it's true.

266
00:18:24,746 --> 00:18:27,146
It was the best choice I could make.

267
00:18:28,505 --> 00:18:30,146
I did it for your own good.

268
00:18:31,305 --> 00:18:32,576
For my own good?

269
00:18:33,746 --> 00:18:35,168
The same old reason.

270
00:18:36,025 --> 00:18:38,176
Then why couldn't you tell me the truth?

271
00:18:40,946 --> 00:18:42,505
It's a long story.

272
00:18:43,345 --> 00:18:44,768
Even if I told you,

273
00:18:44,768 --> 00:18:46,025
you wouldn't understand.

274
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:48,746
I did all of this for you.

275
00:18:48,746 --> 00:18:50,112
Whether I tell you or not isn't important.

276
00:18:52,704 --> 00:18:53,946
Not important?

277
00:18:55,466 --> 00:18:56,512
You're right.

278
00:18:57,146 --> 00:18:58,785
My feelings have never been important.

279
00:19:00,025 --> 00:19:01,440
Because you've never seen me

280
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,328
as a living being.

281
00:19:05,105 --> 00:19:06,405
When you sent me here,

282
00:19:06,405 --> 00:19:07,766
you left without any explanation.

283
00:19:07,766 --> 00:19:10,112
You made decisions as if I were just an object.

284
00:19:10,656 --> 00:19:12,192
How am I supposed to think of myself?

285
00:19:12,706 --> 00:19:14,305
I feel like I'm trash.

286
00:19:14,305 --> 00:19:15,626
Nobody loves me.

287
00:19:15,626 --> 00:19:17,120
And nobody wants me

288
00:19:21,986 --> 00:19:23,072
Yu,

289
00:19:24,426 --> 00:19:26,505
I've never thought of abandoning you.

290
00:19:27,865 --> 00:19:30,144
Otherwise, when I divorced Meng Weiguo,

291
00:19:30,144 --> 00:19:31,456
I wouldn't have let you live with me.

292
00:19:32,256 --> 00:19:33,760
You carry my surname.

293
00:19:35,505 --> 00:19:37,248
How could I abandon you?

294
00:19:40,666 --> 00:19:42,746
If that's the reason,

295
00:19:43,466 --> 00:19:45,986
you could have had another child
who's more obedient than me.

296
00:19:48,345 --> 00:19:49,728
You could have pretended I was never born.

297
00:19:50,386 --> 00:19:51,666
It would be one less burden for you.

298
00:20:03,345 --> 00:20:04,576
Are you happy today?

299
00:20:04,576 --> 00:20:06,706
Sure! Happy New Year!

300
00:20:06,706 --> 00:20:08,256
Happy New Year!

301
00:20:36,256 --> 00:20:38,400
<i>It was the best choice I could make.</i>

302
00:20:39,746 --> 00:20:41,226
<i>I did it for your own good.</i>

303
00:20:41,226 --> 00:20:43,246
<i>Then why couldn't you tell me the truth?</i>

304
00:20:43,246 --> 00:20:44,546
<i>What's the point?</i>

305
00:20:44,546 --> 00:20:45,906
<i>You wouldn't understand anyway.</i>

306
00:20:46,746 --> 00:20:47,776
<i>You're right.</i>

307
00:20:48,345 --> 00:20:49,946
<i>My feelings have never been important.</i>

308
00:20:51,226 --> 00:20:52,626
<i>Because you've never seen me</i>

309
00:20:52,626 --> 00:20:54,345
<i>like a living being.</i>

310
00:20:58,464 --> 00:21:00,466
<i>I think she did this to protect you.</i>

311
00:21:01,312 --> 00:21:02,846
<i>You carry my surname.</i>

312
00:21:02,846 --> 00:21:04,672
<i>How could I abandon you?</i>

313
00:21:04,672 --> 00:21:06,706
<i>If that's the reason,</i>

314
00:21:07,226 --> 00:21:08,426
<i>you could have had another child</i>

315
00:21:08,426 --> 00:21:10,025
<i>who's more obedient than me.</i>

316
00:21:12,505 --> 00:21:13,666
<i>You could have pretended I was never born.</i>

317
00:21:14,208 --> 00:21:15,456
<i>It would be one less burden for you.</i>

318
00:21:35,930 --> 00:21:38,906
<i>[Qinghe Silverware]</i>

319
00:21:50,752 --> 00:21:52,352
Can I stay here for a while?

320
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,305
This place is where you belong.

321
00:22:26,146 --> 00:22:27,265
I just

322
00:22:29,025 --> 00:22:31,168
did something I regret.

323
00:22:32,386 --> 00:22:34,585
I said something selfish.

324
00:22:41,345 --> 00:22:42,464
It's okay.

325
00:22:48,706 --> 00:22:50,432
Earlier on the rooftop,

326
00:22:51,105 --> 00:22:52,768
I didn't mean to hide it from you.

327
00:22:54,386 --> 00:22:56,032
There were just some things

328
00:22:57,466 --> 00:22:59,392
I didn't know how to say.

329
00:23:05,105 --> 00:23:08,832
Well, say it when you're ready.

330
00:23:11,946 --> 00:23:15,232
Lin Yujing, I just want you to know,

331
00:23:16,032 --> 00:23:18,592
I'll always be here.

332
00:23:24,064 --> 00:23:25,632
The New Year is coming soon.

333
00:23:26,386 --> 00:23:28,000
Do you want to celebrate it together?

334
00:23:29,466 --> 00:23:30,592
Sure.

335
00:23:32,386 --> 00:23:33,728
Then it's a deal.

336
00:23:52,865 --> 00:23:54,925
You can go in after signing in at the entrance.

337
00:23:54,925 --> 00:23:56,864
I don't want to. It's too much trouble.

338
00:23:56,864 --> 00:23:58,825
I need to submit an application tomorrow.

339
00:23:59,746 --> 00:24:00,800
Give me a hand.

340
00:24:05,632 --> 00:24:06,688
Come on.

341
00:24:07,825 --> 00:24:10,746
Here we go. Three, two, one.

342
00:24:14,545 --> 00:24:15,906
Hey, can you make it?

343
00:24:16,585 --> 00:24:17,825
Mr. Troublemaker,

344
00:24:17,825 --> 00:24:20,448
can't you help me out
since you're so experienced?

345
00:24:21,545 --> 00:24:23,424
I've never climbed our school wall.

346
00:24:24,265 --> 00:24:25,312
Higher, higher!

347
00:24:25,312 --> 00:24:27,746
Three, two, one!

348
00:24:33,865 --> 00:24:35,346
Don't tell anyone about this.

349
00:24:35,346 --> 00:24:36,486
You've never climbed a wall?

350
00:24:36,486 --> 00:24:37,746
What kind of troublemaker are you?

351
00:24:40,706 --> 00:24:42,585
C-Can you get down safely?

352
00:24:43,545 --> 00:24:44,566
Don't worry.

353
00:24:44,566 --> 00:24:45,760
I certainly can.

354
00:24:46,265 --> 00:24:47,265
Alright, go ahead.

355
00:24:48,706 --> 00:24:49,760
See you tomorrow.

356
00:25:08,906 --> 00:25:10,826
Lin Yujing, you should go wash up.

357
00:25:10,826 --> 00:25:12,352
The lights will be out in five minutes.

358
00:25:12,352 --> 00:25:13,626
You won't be able to see anything.

359
00:25:13,626 --> 00:25:14,688
Thanks.

360
00:25:26,592 --> 00:25:29,065
<i>Mom, I'm staying in the dorm tonight.</i>

361
00:25:54,386 --> 00:25:55,520
Everyone, quiet down.

362
00:25:57,865 --> 00:25:59,186
Silent.

363
00:26:04,345 --> 00:26:05,986
I know what you're thinking.

364
00:26:06,946 --> 00:26:09,792
I'm here to
relay the school's holiday schedule.

365
00:26:10,946 --> 00:26:12,146
Today, after school,

366
00:26:12,146 --> 00:26:14,706
the New Year's holiday will begin.

367
00:26:18,016 --> 00:26:19,072
Quiet.

368
00:26:19,072 --> 00:26:20,896
After this holiday,

369
00:26:20,896 --> 00:26:22,272
you'll have your final exam.

370
00:26:24,746 --> 00:26:27,488
You all understand what this means,

371
00:26:29,105 --> 00:26:30,426
so I won't say more about it.

372
00:26:33,088 --> 00:26:34,105
Class!

373
00:26:34,706 --> 00:26:35,840
Happy New Year.

374
00:26:36,345 --> 00:26:40,544
Mr. Liu, happy New Year.

375
00:26:40,544 --> 00:26:41,696
Class dismissed.

376
00:26:44,105 --> 00:26:46,176
Come on! Where are we going to celebrate?

377
00:26:46,848 --> 00:26:47,872
Follow me and recite,

378
00:26:47,872 --> 00:26:49,305
"Studying makes me happy."

379
00:26:55,936 --> 00:26:58,496
Come on. I'll take you somewhere.

380
00:26:58,496 --> 00:26:59,686
Let He Songnan come with us. Let's go!

381
00:26:59,686 --> 00:27:00,704
Let's go.

382
00:27:15,065 --> 00:27:16,445
Where is this wishing tree?

383
00:27:16,445 --> 00:27:18,505
No hurry. There are many trees here.

384
00:27:21,105 --> 00:27:23,328
Juan, I'm glad that you asked me to come over.

385
00:27:23,328 --> 00:27:24,992
Don't mention it.

386
00:27:24,992 --> 00:27:26,206
But seriously,

387
00:27:26,206 --> 00:27:28,065
I'm about to prepare for
the college entrance exam.

388
00:27:28,065 --> 00:27:30,048
I do need all the gods' blessings.

389
00:27:31,426 --> 00:27:33,666
After you finish your exam, it'll be our turn.

390
00:27:33,666 --> 00:27:34,976
I'll pray in advance.

391
00:27:35,505 --> 00:27:37,086
Dear Gods, hear my prayers,

392
00:27:37,086 --> 00:27:38,726
please shower me with your blessings.

393
00:27:38,726 --> 00:27:40,466
Bless me, Wang Yiyang, to pass every exam.

394
00:27:41,186 --> 00:27:43,426
He Songnan has good grades,
so his prayers might work.

395
00:27:43,426 --> 00:27:45,206
But you? I don't think
the wishing tree will help you out.

396
00:27:45,206 --> 00:27:46,272
Shut it!

397
00:27:48,224 --> 00:27:49,312
This place is quite big.

398
00:27:49,312 --> 00:27:50,496
Why don't we split up and look around?

399
00:27:50,496 --> 00:27:52,096
We'll meet back here later.

400
00:27:52,096 --> 00:27:53,184
Okay.

401
00:27:53,184 --> 00:27:54,208
Let's go.

402
00:27:54,208 --> 00:27:55,264
Let's go over there.

403
00:28:05,664 --> 00:28:06,848
When in Rome, do as the Romans do.

404
00:28:12,416 --> 00:28:13,466
Follow me.

405
00:28:50,464 --> 00:28:54,048
<i>♫ When a ray of light shines in my life ♫</i>

406
00:28:54,048 --> 00:28:57,376
<i>♫It lights up the direction
where my heart follows ♫</i>

407
00:28:57,376 --> 00:29:00,736
<i>♫ We always have our doubts ♫</i>

408
00:29:00,736 --> 00:29:04,096
<i>♫ But life always needs to set sail ♫</i>

409
00:29:04,096 --> 00:29:07,104
<i>♫ When you sit beside me ♫</i>

410
00:29:07,104 --> 00:29:10,144
<i>♫ Asking me where home is ♫</i>

411
00:29:10,848 --> 00:29:16,032
<i>♫ I point to a star in the night sky ♫</i>

412
00:29:16,768 --> 00:29:22,560
<i>♫ That's where it guides us ♫</i>

413
00:29:26,688 --> 00:29:30,624
<i>♫ You are the weary bird in my palm ♫</i>

414
00:29:30,624 --> 00:29:33,792
<i>♫ I can't bear to let you fly far away ♫</i>

415
00:29:33,792 --> 00:29:36,997
<i>♫ I am the paper boat in your heart ♫</i>

416
00:29:36,997 --> 00:29:40,704
<i>♫ And you are my only harbor ♫</i>

417
00:29:40,704 --> 00:29:44,128
<i>♫ Time is the sand
slipping through my fingers ♫</i>

418
00:29:44,128 --> 00:29:47,264
<i>♫ Our youth plays a beautiful rhythm ♫</i>

419
00:29:47,264 --> 00:29:50,730
<i>♫ And we will never be apart ♫</i>

420
00:29:50,730 --> 00:29:54,016
<i>♫ The weary bird returns ♫</i>

421
00:29:54,016 --> 00:29:58,400
<i>♫ We have been used to saying goodbyes ♫</i>

422
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:01,280
<i>♫ Yet tears stream down our faces
before we can say a word ♫</i>

423
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:04,384
<i>♫ I want to hug you with all I have ♫</i>

424
00:30:04,384 --> 00:30:10,016
<i>♫ But I can't say our promise out loud ♫</i>

425
00:30:10,016 --> 00:30:14,249
<i>♫ You are the weary bird in my palm ♫</i>

426
00:30:14,249 --> 00:30:17,120
<i>♫ I can't bear to let you fly far away ♫</i>

427
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:20,416
<i>♫ I am the paper boat in your heart ♫</i>

428
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:23,968
<i>♫ And you are my only harbor ♫</i>

429
00:30:23,968 --> 00:30:27,571
<i>♫ Time is the sand
slipping through my fingers ♫</i>

430
00:30:27,571 --> 00:30:30,656
<i>♫ Our youth plays a beautiful rhythm ♫</i>

431
00:30:30,656 --> 00:30:34,048
<i>♫ And we will never be apart ♫</i>

432
00:30:34,048 --> 00:30:38,368
<i>♫ The weary bird returns ♫</i>

433
00:30:43,946 --> 00:30:46,752
Actually, when I first started high school,

434
00:30:46,752 --> 00:30:48,192
I never thought that on my second year,

435
00:30:48,736 --> 00:30:52,256
I would celebrate New Year
in a place far away from Huaicheng.

436
00:30:53,626 --> 00:30:55,826
At first, I wasn't quite used to this city.

437
00:30:55,826 --> 00:30:57,526
But it actually turns out to be quite nice.

438
00:30:57,526 --> 00:30:59,008
The air is humid,

439
00:30:59,545 --> 00:31:00,992
and the winter isn't so cold.

440
00:31:01,785 --> 00:31:03,232
The food here is satisfying.

441
00:31:03,865 --> 00:31:05,216
Now that I think about it,

442
00:31:06,105 --> 00:31:08,505
it would be nice to stay here forever.

443
00:31:12,505 --> 00:31:13,824
Then don't ever leave here.

444
00:31:15,666 --> 00:31:16,746
Stay.

445
00:31:20,666 --> 00:31:21,865
Let's get into Pucheng University together.

446
00:31:28,065 --> 00:31:29,120
Okay.

447
00:31:29,626 --> 00:31:30,656
That's a deal.

448
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,704
We'll be classmates for another four years.

449
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:58,166
Have you made your wish?

450
00:31:58,166 --> 00:31:59,200
Yeah.

451
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,672
Now I feel much more at ease.

452
00:32:00,672 --> 00:32:02,406
I'm going back to study now.

453
00:32:02,406 --> 00:32:03,846
Aren't you going to
watch the fireworks with us?

454
00:32:03,846 --> 00:32:04,966
New Year's Eve happens every year,

455
00:32:04,966 --> 00:32:06,146
but the college entrance exam
is once in a lifetime.

456
00:32:07,265 --> 00:32:08,346
I won't join you either.

457
00:32:08,346 --> 00:32:09,866
Some relatives came to visit my family.

458
00:32:09,866 --> 00:32:11,072
My dad asked me to stay at home.

459
00:32:11,072 --> 00:32:12,706
- Let's go.
- Bye!

460
00:32:24,946 --> 00:32:26,240
If you have something to do,

461
00:32:26,825 --> 00:32:28,192
you can go back first.

462
00:32:29,986 --> 00:32:32,046
I won't miss the fireworks
if I have dinner first, right?

463
00:32:32,046 --> 00:32:33,225
You won't miss it.

464
00:32:33,225 --> 00:32:34,366
If you want to watch the fireworks,

465
00:32:34,366 --> 00:32:35,424
I'll wait for you.

466
00:32:35,424 --> 00:32:37,446
Alright, I'll see you after dinner.

467
00:32:37,446 --> 00:32:38,766
Let's meet at the entrance of Tang Palace.

468
00:32:38,766 --> 00:32:40,585
I heard it's a good place to watch fireworks.

469
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:42,386
Okay.

470
00:32:43,105 --> 00:32:44,192
I'll be leaving.

471
00:32:54,336 --> 00:32:55,506
Mr. Zhang,

472
00:32:55,506 --> 00:32:57,280
I need to trouble you with something.

473
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:59,305
I want to transfer Lin Yujing
back to Huaicheng High School.

474
00:32:59,305 --> 00:33:00,320
The sooner the better.

475
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:02,208
I'm expecting to
complete all the transfer procedures

476
00:33:02,208 --> 00:33:03,968
before the start of her next semester.

477
00:33:03,968 --> 00:33:05,248
Okay, please rest assured.

478
00:33:15,296 --> 00:33:16,486
Let's toast!

479
00:33:16,486 --> 00:33:20,128
- Happy New Year, everyone.
- Happy New Year!

480
00:33:26,186 --> 00:33:27,456
Everyone, eat up. Come on.

481
00:33:27,456 --> 00:33:29,696
You're so generous, Ms. Lin.

482
00:33:29,696 --> 00:33:32,096
This restaurant is very good.

483
00:33:32,096 --> 00:33:34,445
You must have made a reservation
a long time ago.

484
00:33:34,445 --> 00:33:35,840
I'm flattered, Mr. Wang.

485
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:37,216
I just want to

486
00:33:37,216 --> 00:33:39,488
celebrate the New Year with everyone.

487
00:33:40,544 --> 00:33:41,664
Everyone, eat up.

488
00:33:41,664 --> 00:33:43,520
Come on. Let's start eating.

489
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:44,576
Mom,

490
00:33:45,664 --> 00:33:48,160
I have something to do tonight.
I'll be leaving now.

491
00:33:49,505 --> 00:33:51,296
It's very late. What are you up to?

492
00:33:52,226 --> 00:33:53,696
Happy New Year, everyone.

493
00:33:53,696 --> 00:33:54,848
I'm leaving.

494
00:33:54,848 --> 00:33:56,065
- Okay, go ahead.
- Are you leaving now?

495
00:33:56,065 --> 00:33:57,184
- Be careful!
- Okay.

496
00:33:59,328 --> 00:34:01,506
She's still a kid,
and it's New Year's Eve tonight.

497
00:34:01,506 --> 00:34:02,825
She must have plans with her classmates.

498
00:34:03,386 --> 00:34:04,666
Just let her go. Don't worry.

499
00:34:05,265 --> 00:34:06,526
Come on. Let's drink!

500
00:34:06,526 --> 00:34:07,706
Let's drink!

501
00:34:07,706 --> 00:34:09,006
Let's toast. Happy New Year!

502
00:34:09,006 --> 00:34:10,206
Happy New Year! Cheers!

503
00:34:10,206 --> 00:34:11,264
Cheers!

504
00:34:16,985 --> 00:34:18,880
Happy New Year!

505
00:34:39,936 --> 00:34:41,184
Where are you?

506
00:34:41,184 --> 00:34:42,646
I'm downstairs at the Tang Palace.

507
00:34:42,646 --> 00:34:43,865
There are too many people
at the elevator entrance.

508
00:34:43,865 --> 00:34:45,685
I might not make it before midnight.

509
00:34:45,685 --> 00:34:46,905
You'll make it. Don't worry.

510
00:34:46,905 --> 00:34:47,936
Wait for me at the elevator entrance.

511
00:34:47,936 --> 00:34:48,960
I'm coming to you now.

512
00:34:50,208 --> 00:34:51,586
Okay.

513
00:36:33,506 --> 00:36:34,752
Lin Yujing!

514
00:36:41,746 --> 00:36:43,072
Ten!

515
00:36:43,666 --> 00:36:44,825
Nine!

516
00:36:45,385 --> 00:36:46,546
Eight!

517
00:36:47,425 --> 00:36:48,672
Seven!

518
00:36:49,506 --> 00:36:50,706
Six!

519
00:36:51,785 --> 00:36:53,026
Five!

520
00:36:54,746 --> 00:36:55,905
Four!

521
00:36:56,706 --> 00:36:57,824
Three!

522
00:36:58,626 --> 00:36:59,865
Two!

523
00:37:01,546 --> 00:37:02,786
One!

524
00:37:02,786 --> 00:37:05,690
Happy New Year!

525
00:37:05,690 --> 00:37:09,018
<i>♫ Swimming towards the galaxy ♫</i>

526
00:37:09,946 --> 00:37:14,810
<i>♫ It docks at the blue shore of my heart ♫</i>

527
00:37:14,810 --> 00:37:19,802
<i>♫ I hear the poems coming from afar ♫</i>

528
00:37:20,442 --> 00:37:26,042
<i>♫ Happiness and sorrow come and go ♫</i>

529
00:37:26,042 --> 00:37:31,610
<i>♫ As my memories dance along the clouds ♫</i>

530
00:37:31,610 --> 00:37:35,418
<i>♫ I still remember ♫</i>

531
00:37:37,242 --> 00:37:43,034
<i>♫ Please wait for me at the horizon ♫</i>

532
00:37:43,034 --> 00:37:46,298
<i>♫ We'll watch the sunset together ♫</i>

533
00:37:48,538 --> 00:37:54,272
<i>♫ Whose dream hasn't been beautiful ♫</i>

534
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:55,712
Happy New Year.

535
00:37:57,066 --> 00:37:58,464
Happy New Year.

536
00:37:59,898 --> 00:38:05,658
<i>♫ Wait for me at the end of the daydream ♫</i>

537
00:38:05,658 --> 00:38:09,082
<i>♫ Who has wandered within it ♫</i>

538
00:38:11,162 --> 00:38:16,122
<i>♫ Life is nothing more than fantasy ♫</i>

539
00:38:16,986 --> 00:38:20,992
<i>♫ I am still me ♫</i>

540
00:38:31,706 --> 00:38:33,586
I had a great time today.

541
00:38:34,146 --> 00:38:35,936
Thank you for your hospitality, Ms. Lin.

542
00:38:36,465 --> 00:38:37,766
You're welcome.

543
00:38:37,766 --> 00:38:39,606
After the New Year, I'll have my colleagues

544
00:38:39,606 --> 00:38:41,206
coordinate the details with your people.

545
00:38:41,206 --> 00:38:42,432
Okay.

546
00:38:42,432 --> 00:38:43,648
Goodbye.

547
00:39:03,008 --> 00:39:05,056
Go back and rest early.

548
00:39:06,506 --> 00:39:07,584
Okay.

549
00:39:08,096 --> 00:39:09,568
Send me a message when you get home.

550
00:39:12,626 --> 00:39:14,026
- I'm leaving.
- Bye.

551
00:39:14,546 --> 00:39:16,128
Bye.

552
00:39:54,144 --> 00:39:56,352
The only reason that I came here

553
00:39:56,896 --> 00:39:58,208
is to take you back.

554
00:39:59,226 --> 00:40:00,945
After this semester ends,

555
00:40:01,465 --> 00:40:02,945
you'll go back to Huaicheng with me.

556
00:40:22,865 --> 00:40:24,106
What do you mean

557
00:40:24,106 --> 00:40:25,746
by taking me back to Huaicheng?

558
00:40:25,746 --> 00:40:27,328
Have you ever asked for my opinion?

559
00:40:29,666 --> 00:40:31,345
Didn't you want to go back to Huaicheng before?

560
00:40:32,186 --> 00:40:33,446
Yeah. Before.

561
00:40:33,446 --> 00:40:34,566
But I don't want to go back now.

562
00:40:34,566 --> 00:40:35,872
I like it here.

563
00:40:37,888 --> 00:40:39,392
What exactly do you like?

564
00:40:40,106 --> 00:40:41,506
Everything.

565
00:40:42,465 --> 00:40:44,046
I like the weather here.

566
00:40:44,046 --> 00:40:45,746
I like the roads here.

567
00:40:45,746 --> 00:40:46,784
I like the breakfast here.

568
00:40:46,784 --> 00:40:47,808
I like the people here.

569
00:40:47,808 --> 00:40:48,960
I don't want to leave now.

570
00:40:51,666 --> 00:40:53,026
The people?

571
00:40:54,506 --> 00:40:55,840
You're really sensible.

572
00:40:57,425 --> 00:40:58,766
It's settled.

573
00:40:58,766 --> 00:41:00,192
You must go back with me.

574
00:41:01,066 --> 00:41:02,546
What if I refuse?

575
00:41:02,546 --> 00:41:04,384
Are you going to force me?

576
00:41:11,392 --> 00:41:14,592
Lin Yujing, what are you talking about?

577
00:41:14,592 --> 00:41:15,808
Did I say it wrong?

578
00:41:16,905 --> 00:41:18,240
Since my childhood,

579
00:41:19,026 --> 00:41:21,216
when have you ever followed my wishes?

580
00:41:24,465 --> 00:41:25,945
You've been living as you wish

581
00:41:26,546 --> 00:41:28,864
since your dad has never disciplined you.

582
00:41:28,864 --> 00:41:30,265
Look at you now.

583
00:41:31,146 --> 00:41:32,406
You're about to
take the college entrance exam in a year.

584
00:41:32,406 --> 00:41:34,048
Yet your grades are falling,

585
00:41:34,048 --> 00:41:36,096
and you hang out until midnight
before coming home.

586
00:41:48,586 --> 00:41:50,186
Let me make it clear to you, Lin Yujing,

587
00:41:50,985 --> 00:41:52,425
I'm not giving you a choice.

588
00:42:21,746 --> 00:42:23,552
<i>Happy New Year, Shen Juan.</i>

589
00:42:27,232 --> 00:42:29,600
<i>Happy New Year, Lin Yujing.</i>

590
00:42:43,066 --> 00:42:47,610
<i>♫ Love sprouts in my palm ♫</i>

591
00:42:48,922 --> 00:42:52,762

00:43:21,402 --> 00:43:27,450
<i>♫ Turned into a rainbow within my heart ♫</i>

598
00:43:27,962 --> 00:43:33,530

599
00:43:33,530 --> 00:43:35,418
<i>♫ I want to share with you ♫</i>

600
00:43:35,418 --> 00:43:40,090

603
00:43:50,202 --> 00:43:55,904
<i>♫ Do you want to hear me sing ♫</i>

604
00:43:55,904 --> 00:44:00,666
<i>♫ The wind chime swaying in my heart ♫</i>

605
00:44:01,210 --> 00:44:05,434
<i>♫ Is a wish ♫</i>

606
00:44:06,170 --> 00:44:12,058
<i>♫ I secretly made for you ♫</i>

607
00:44:12,602 --> 00:44:18,138
<i>♫ I want to plant ♫</i>

608
00:44:18,138 --> 00:44:20,026
<i>♫ A red maple forest ♫</i>

609
00:44:20,026 --> 00:44:24,634
<i>♫ To dye the whole mountain red ♫</i>

610
00:44:25,562 --> 00:44:27,802
<i>♫ The sky after the rain ♫</i>

611
00:44:28,442 --> 00:44:33,370
<i>♫ Was painted by our brilliant dreams ♫</i>

612
00:44:40,250 --> 00:44:45,018
<i>♫ Time is a flower of dream ♫</i>

613
00:44:45,850 --> 00:44:50,936
<i>♫ You've already collected it ♫</i>

614
00:44:51,866 --> 00:44:55,866
<i>♫ When we all become better ♫</i>

615
00:44:57,338 --> 00:45:01,466
<i>♫ We'll see the best of the world together ♫</i>
