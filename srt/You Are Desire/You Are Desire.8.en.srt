Come on. Do you have an idea?

24
00:02:15,268 --> 00:02:16,867
Can't you hear me out?

25
00:02:17,547 --> 00:02:19,847
Are you planning to put Juan in a bag?

26
00:02:19,847 --> 00:02:22,147
Where can you find a box to fit three people?

27
00:02:22,827 --> 00:02:25,448
Can such a big box fit in that shop?

28
00:02:25,448 --> 00:02:28,668
That's not an issue.

29
00:02:29,388 --> 00:02:30,527
We should put you in a box.

30
00:02:30,527 --> 00:02:31,628
This is not a surprise

31
00:02:31,628 --> 00:02:32,708
but a scare. Next.

32
00:02:32,708 --> 00:02:34,227
It is not feasible. Next.

33
00:02:34,227 --> 00:02:36,148
Since you two are echoing each other,

34
00:02:36,148 --> 00:02:37,347
just put forward an idea.

35
00:02:39,748 --> 00:02:42,788
Juan didn't celebrate his birthday before,

36
00:02:42,788 --> 00:02:46,547
but I've already thought of what to give him.

37
00:02:47,107 --> 00:02:48,707
He didn't celebrate his birthday?

38
00:02:49,627 --> 00:02:50,848
Is it because of his uncle?

39
00:02:50,848 --> 00:02:52,488
His uncle celebrated his birthday

40
00:02:52,488 --> 00:02:54,148
when he was a child.

41
00:02:54,148 --> 00:02:56,588
And I remember the cake was quite delicious.

42
00:02:56,588 --> 00:03:00,948
But when he grew up, it never happened.

43
00:03:02,028 --> 00:03:03,547
I don't remember much either

44
00:03:04,707 --> 00:03:07,627
So what will you get him?

45
00:03:08,788 --> 00:03:11,488
I'll give him a sealstone that can be engraved.

46
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:15,708
Let me show you. How is it?

47
00:03:15,708 --> 00:03:16,908
Looks good.

48
00:03:16,908 --> 00:03:18,907
In ancient times, 18 was the age of adulthood.

49
00:03:18,907 --> 00:03:20,168
People could make promises to the world

50
00:03:20,168 --> 00:03:21,428
with their own names.

51
00:03:21,428 --> 00:03:23,748
I spent much time on this gift.

52
00:03:23,748 --> 00:03:24,907
It's a good gift.

53
00:03:25,987 --> 00:03:28,468
Juan can carve.

54
00:03:28,468 --> 00:03:30,388
He can carve whatever he wants. It's perfect.

55
00:03:31,187 --> 00:03:33,308
I can't believe you.

56
00:03:34,827 --> 00:03:36,568
You've been planning this for a long time.

57
00:03:36,568 --> 00:03:37,628
And you even made fun of me

58
00:03:37,628 --> 00:03:39,307
with Lin Yujing.

59
00:03:39,307 --> 00:03:40,868
That's your problem.

60
00:03:42,028 --> 00:03:43,628
And you have time to get him a gift.

61
00:03:43,628 --> 00:03:45,448
You know Juan so well.

62
00:03:45,448 --> 00:03:48,387
Think about what he lacks the most.

63
00:03:50,347 --> 00:03:52,328
As far as I know,

64
00:03:52,328 --> 00:03:56,387
Juan lacks money.

65
00:03:57,428 --> 00:04:01,108
He lacks sleep the most,
but I can't help with that.

66
00:04:01,787 --> 00:04:03,168
Good idea.

67
00:04:03,168 --> 00:04:04,428
Am I right, Lin Yujing?

68
00:04:05,148 --> 00:04:06,528
Since he doesn't like
to celebrate his birthday,

69
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:07,668
let's be flexible.

70
00:04:07,668 --> 00:04:09,467
How about celebrating it the day before?

71
00:04:10,028 --> 00:04:11,048
The day before?

72
00:04:11,048 --> 00:04:12,187
I think it's okay.

73
00:04:12,787 --> 00:04:13,808
Don't you think

74
00:04:13,808 --> 00:04:14,808
he doesn't look like a high school student?

75
00:04:14,808 --> 00:04:17,287
The first time I saw him,
I thought he was an office worker.

76
00:04:17,287 --> 00:04:19,088
He makes money, works, and studies.

77
00:04:19,088 --> 00:04:20,528
There's nothing he can't do.

78
00:04:20,528 --> 00:04:22,548
Just like you said, Juan is omnipotent.

79
00:04:23,268 --> 00:04:25,507
Actually, Juan is a little younger than me.

80
00:04:26,227 --> 00:04:27,648
I always treat him as an older brother.

81
00:04:27,648 --> 00:04:30,187
So, he's just living too hard.

82
00:04:31,308 --> 00:04:32,728
It seems like he's experienced

83
00:04:32,728 --> 00:04:34,148
what adults can do.

84
00:04:34,148 --> 00:04:35,148
Why don't we

85
00:04:35,148 --> 00:04:36,308
let him relive the joy

86
00:04:36,308 --> 00:04:38,227
of being a minor on the last day of 17.

87
00:04:38,976 --> 00:04:40,108
That's a good idea.

88
00:04:40,108 --> 00:04:41,787
We think about how to make him happy.

89
00:04:42,748 --> 00:04:44,808
I'm not familiar with this city.

90
00:04:44,808 --> 00:04:45,828
I don't know what to do.

91
00:04:45,828 --> 00:04:47,308
I know this place pretty well.

92
00:04:47,828 --> 00:04:49,888
Don't worry. Leave it to me.

93
00:04:49,888 --> 00:04:51,668
I'll make a perfect plan.

94
00:04:51,668 --> 00:04:52,688
However,

95
00:04:52,688 --> 00:04:54,948
since I do this job,

96
00:04:54,948 --> 00:04:56,387
I'll consider it as my gift for Juan.

97
00:04:57,708 --> 00:04:59,227
You think of something else.

98
00:05:00,787 --> 00:05:02,328
How shameless you are.

99
00:05:02,328 --> 00:05:04,067
It's a mean trick.

100
00:05:05,588 --> 00:05:08,688
You're so clever.

101
00:05:08,688 --> 00:05:11,367
You can think of another one, right?

102
00:05:11,367 --> 00:05:12,548
I'm not smart.

103
00:05:12,548 --> 00:05:15,988
I really can't think of it.

104
00:05:15,988 --> 00:05:17,148
I beg you.

105
00:05:17,148 --> 00:05:19,588
Please let me do this.

106
00:05:19,588 --> 00:05:21,668
Is that okay?

107
00:05:21,668 --> 00:05:23,427
I'll talk to Uncle.

108
00:05:23,427 --> 00:05:25,108
Xu Ruyi can join us.

109
00:05:25,108 --> 00:05:26,528
We can celebrate

110
00:05:26,528 --> 00:05:27,987
Juan's eighteenth birthday together.

111
00:05:27,987 --> 00:05:29,148
Is that okay?

112
00:05:31,308 --> 00:05:32,507
You better think of it yourself.

113
00:05:33,387 --> 00:05:34,387
I can't think of anything.

114
00:05:38,308 --> 00:05:39,428
What are you talking about behind my back?

115
00:05:40,148 --> 00:05:41,408
- Study.
- Meal.

116
00:05:43,936 --> 00:05:45,187
- Meal.
- Study.

117
00:05:46,827 --> 00:05:48,107
We eat before studying.

118
00:05:48,107 --> 00:05:49,387
Yes, let's eat first.

119
00:05:50,668 --> 00:05:52,068
Come on, learn it.

120
00:05:52,068 --> 00:05:53,547
Try this.

121
00:05:53,547 --> 00:05:54,656
Eat and learn.

00:06:13,627 --> 00:06:15,788
Well, maybe I better

125
00:06:15,788 --> 00:06:17,587
skip Shen Juan's birthday party.

126
00:06:19,908 --> 00:06:22,147
I don't know what gift to give him.

127
00:06:22,868 --> 00:06:24,447
No need to give any gift.

128
00:06:24,447 --> 00:06:26,108
We just eat hot pot together.

129
00:06:26,108 --> 00:06:28,428
You can bring something to eat.

130
00:06:28,428 --> 00:06:29,588
We tried the sauce

131
00:06:29,588 --> 00:06:31,267
from your hometown.

132
00:06:31,267 --> 00:06:32,788
I think it's pretty delicious.

133
00:06:32,788 --> 00:06:34,248
Organic farm food.

134
00:06:34,248 --> 00:06:35,428
It's healthy.

135
00:06:36,548 --> 00:06:38,947
Okay, what about you?

136
00:06:41,868 --> 00:06:42,948
I originally had an idea,

137
00:06:42,948 --> 00:06:44,147
but Wang Yiyang stole it.

138
00:06:44,668 --> 00:06:46,108
I haven't thought of a new one.

139
00:06:46,627 --> 00:06:47,748
Do you have any good ideas?

140
00:06:50,788 --> 00:06:52,548
Who else can I ask?

141
00:06:59,267 --> 00:07:00,748
Since you sincerely asked,

142
00:07:00,748 --> 00:07:03,387
I will generously advise you.

143
00:07:05,067 --> 00:07:07,387
I suggest something boys like.

144
00:07:09,668 --> 00:07:10,727
For example,

145
00:07:10,727 --> 00:07:11,908
drones or something.

146
00:07:14,428 --> 00:07:15,828
I don't know what others do on their birthday.

147
00:07:15,828 --> 00:07:16,928
Anyway, on my birthday,

148
00:07:16,928 --> 00:07:18,388
I will just throw a big party.

149
00:07:18,388 --> 00:07:20,028
Everyone eats and drinks together.

150
00:07:20,028 --> 00:07:22,408
I receive gifts, red envelopes or something.

151
00:07:22,408 --> 00:07:23,627
It's really fun.

152
00:07:24,507 --> 00:07:26,588
On my birthday,

153
00:07:26,588 --> 00:07:27,727
I just have a meal

154
00:07:27,727 --> 00:07:29,827
with my family.

155
00:07:29,827 --> 00:07:31,047
Then my mom

156
00:07:31,047 --> 00:07:32,828
makes me longevity noodles.

157
00:07:32,828 --> 00:07:34,507
What's so good about longevity noodles?

158
00:07:35,868 --> 00:07:36,868
Just noodles.

159
00:07:37,868 --> 00:07:38,908
The noodles my mom makes

160
00:07:38,908 --> 00:07:40,788
are much better than those from the restaurant.

161
00:07:41,348 --> 00:07:42,888
If you want to eat,

162
00:07:42,888 --> 00:07:44,348
I'll bring some for you next time.

163
00:07:45,548 --> 00:07:48,148
Well, since you've brought it up,

164
00:07:48,148 --> 00:07:49,368
I'll give it a try.

165
00:07:49,368 --> 00:07:50,496
Okay.

166
00:07:57,428 --> 00:07:58,488
Xu Ruyi.

167
00:07:58,488 --> 00:07:59,947
You're right.

168
00:07:59,947 --> 00:08:02,147
The closest person is the best gift.

169
00:08:13,668 --> 00:08:15,468
Did you get what I asked you to bring?

170
00:08:27,387 --> 00:08:29,108
Why did you bring your computer?

171
00:08:29,108 --> 00:08:30,628
Why don't you do it in the dorm?

172
00:08:30,628 --> 00:08:32,308
My roommates are sleeping.

173
00:08:32,908 --> 00:08:33,947
It's not convenient.

174
00:08:35,387 --> 00:08:36,947
Why do you
want Shen Juan's uncle's information?

175
00:08:37,788 --> 00:08:39,007
I thought of what to get

176
00:08:39,007 --> 00:08:40,167
for Shen Juan's birthday.

177
00:08:40,167 --> 00:08:41,248
Did you?

178
00:08:42,627 --> 00:08:44,627
Let me take a look.

179
00:08:45,428 --> 00:08:48,008
I'm afraid you'll steal my idea.

180
00:08:48,008 --> 00:08:50,548
I can help you, like editing videos.

181
00:08:52,027 --> 00:08:53,947
I want to do it myself.

182
00:08:56,736 --> 00:08:57,768
You may leave.

183
00:08:57,768 --> 00:08:59,387
- What does that mean?
- Go.

184
00:08:59,387 --> 00:09:00,627
Burning bridges?

185
00:09:14,147 --> 00:09:15,308

Sit down.

195
00:10:22,708 --> 00:10:23,988

It's your birthday in three days.

I will officially hand over this shop

After your birthday, we go
to the Bureau of Industry and Commerce

203
00:11:02,768 --> 00:11:05,507
and change the name to yours.

204

nothing here will change,

How could it be?

00:14:30,068 --> 00:14:31,068
Well,

232
00:14:31,667 --> 00:14:34,228
I really didn't.

233
00:14:36,027 --> 00:14:37,280

Please, Yujing.

235
00:14:40,308 --> 00:14:41,627
Tell me what to do.

239
00:15:08,768 --> 00:15:09,787
Say it.

240
00:15:10,468 --> 00:15:13,468
Juan, I have something to say.

241
00:15:15,507 --> 00:15:17,108
But I can only do it at Pucheng Mall.

242

Juan.

243
00:15:24,888 --> 00:15:25,988
I'll get my bag.

244

255
00:16:23,188 --> 00:16:24,727
We are, but it's not unexpected.

256
00:16:24,727 --> 00:16:26,268
Wang Yiyang, are you a little kid?

257
00:16:26,268 --> 00:16:28,008
Didn't we agree

258
00:16:28,008 --> 00:16:29,708
to give Juan a happy underage experience?

259
00:16:29,708 --> 00:16:31,988
How happy this is.

260
00:16:34,228 --> 00:16:35,392
Go.

261
00:16:36,228 --> 00:16:37,280

265
00:16:44,068 --> 00:16:45,688
I can't do such an embarrassing thing.

266

Juan, He Songnan.

268
00:16:51,027 --> 00:16:52,427
You just failed.

269
00:16:57,027 --> 00:17:00,508
Sit. It's not a terrible gift.

270
00:17:00,508 --> 00:17:02,468
Please. I can't even stretch my legs.

271
00:17:04,948 --> 00:17:05,948
Let me take a video.

272
00:17:07,708 --> 00:17:11,768
Shen Juan, look at you.

273
00:17:11,768 --> 00:17:13,308
I must keep this video.

274
00:17:13,308 --> 00:17:14,708
I'll send it to you when your hair turns white.

275

Don't break your word.

276
00:17:17,427 --> 00:17:18,507
You smile.

277

Sit down.

278
00:17:21,748 --> 00:17:23,608
Don't waste time.

283
00:17:30,588 --> 00:17:32,027
Just one lap for this race.

285
00:17:33,388 --> 00:17:34,748
for a whole term.

286
00:17:35,427 --> 00:17:36,948
Three.

287
00:17:36,948 --> 00:17:38,144
Two.

288
00:17:38,868 --> 00:17:39,888
Two.

289
00:17:39,888 --> 00:17:41,787
- Bye.
- Wang Yiyang, you're too childish.

290
00:17:41,787 --> 00:17:43,307
You're playing tricks.

291
00:17:46,988 --> 00:17:48,068
Didn't you say you wouldn't play?

292
00:17:48,787 --> 00:17:50,628
What are you doing now?

293
00:17:50,628 --> 00:17:52,188
You're playing tricks.

294
00:17:53,988 --> 00:17:55,767
What happened to you?

295
00:17:55,767 --> 00:17:57,088
My throttle doesn't work.

296
00:17:57,088 --> 00:17:58,428
Don't forget the punishment for a loser.

297
00:17:58,428 --> 00:17:59,988
- Don't forget it.
- My throttle doesn't work.

298
00:18:00,988 --> 00:18:02,147
A whole semester.

299
00:18:11,307 --> 00:18:13,147
Wang Yiyang, you're cheating.

300
00:19:37,988 --> 00:19:39,827
I think you like Wang Yiyang's gift.

301
00:19:40,388 --> 00:19:42,428
I've never seen you so happy before,

302
00:19:42,428 --> 00:19:43,507
except…

303
00:19:44,628 --> 00:19:45,760
Except what?

304
00:19:46,587 --> 00:19:48,107
Anyway, I've never seen it before.

305
00:19:50,307 --> 00:19:51,327
So, I always

306
00:19:51,327 --> 00:19:52,468
pulled a long face before?

307
00:19:53,547 --> 00:19:54,588
Otherwise, why was everyone afraid of you

308
00:19:54,588 --> 00:19:55,827
when school started?

309
00:19:59,948 --> 00:20:02,388
Actually, I was quite envious of you now.

310
00:20:03,067 --> 00:20:04,647
You are an adult now.

311
00:20:04,647 --> 00:20:06,748
You can choose where to study

312
00:20:06,748 --> 00:20:07,827
and who to be friends with.

313
00:20:08,388 --> 00:20:09,948
And you own a shop.

314
00:20:09,948 --> 00:20:11,107
It's awesome.

315
00:20:13,468 --> 00:20:14,708
But today, I think

316
00:20:15,267 --> 00:20:17,787
you seemed happier when you were a child.

317
00:20:18,307 --> 00:20:19,428
You could be carefree,

318
00:20:20,107 --> 00:20:22,107
and someone cared about and protected you.

319
00:20:22,748 --> 00:20:24,087
You loved to laugh.

320
00:20:24,087 --> 00:20:25,748
You have two dimples when laughing.

321
00:20:28,908 --> 00:20:30,468
Have you seen what I looked like
when I was a child?

322
00:20:32,988 --> 00:20:35,188
I even forgot what I looked like
when I was a child.

323
00:20:35,948 --> 00:20:37,087
I haven't seen it.

324
00:20:37,087 --> 00:20:38,988
I imagined it from what you look like today.

325
00:20:40,708 --> 00:20:42,988
Anyway, I hope every year on your birthday,

326
00:20:43,628 --> 00:20:45,228
you can be as happy as you are today.

327
00:20:50,107 --> 00:20:51,228
What about your gift?

328
00:20:53,867 --> 00:20:54,948
Can it make me happy?

329
00:20:57,748 --> 00:20:58,827
Lin Yujing.

330
00:20:58,827 --> 00:21:01,447
Come here. Hurry.

331
00:21:01,447 --> 00:21:02,827
Look, a pink whale.

332
00:21:05,107 --> 00:21:06,708
You wish. I don't have money

333
00:21:06,708 --> 00:21:07,708
for your gift.

334
00:21:10,547 --> 00:21:12,307
Can you be faster?

335
00:21:12,307 --> 00:21:13,588
Don't rush me.

336
00:21:13,588 --> 00:21:15,388
- I'll take a picture for you with your phone.
- Come on.

337
00:21:16,107 --> 00:21:17,507

- Okay.

You brought this from your hometown?

352
00:22:15,188 --> 00:22:17,427
Smells good. It must be delicious with hot pot.

353

Shen Juan, we haven't had many visitors

359
00:22:35,688 --> 00:22:37,168
for a long time.

360
00:22:37,168 --> 00:22:38,547
Let's celebrate.

361
00:22:39,107 --> 00:22:40,768
Being with you young people,

362
00:22:40,768 --> 00:22:42,188
I even feel young.

363
00:22:42,827 --> 00:22:44,807
Uncle, you're not old at all.

364
00:22:44,807 --> 00:22:46,307
You're a sweet talker.

365
00:22:46,827 --> 00:22:47,948
Sit.

Your classmates came
to celebrate your birthday.

368
00:22:56,067 --> 00:22:58,668
You've grown up. I'm happy for you.

369

I know what you're saying.

371
00:23:03,148 --> 00:23:05,228
Today,

555
00:42:23,748 --> 00:42:25,947
<i>I haven't laughed so freely in a long time.</i>

556
00:42:27,188 --> 00:42:29,867
<i>Nor have I cried so hard.</i>

557
00:42:30,628 --> 00:42:31,748
<i>If I got any magic,</i>

558
00:42:32,867 --> 00:42:35,548
<i>I wish I could be a carefree child for a day.</i>

559
00:42:47,844 --> 00:42:52,388
<i>♫ Love sprouts in my palm ♫</i>

560
00:42:53,700 --> 00:42:57,540
<i>♫ Yet worried linger within my eyes ♫</i>

561
00:42:59,332 --> 00:43:03,908
<i>♫ Our story hasn't ended ♫</i>

562
00:43:04,836 --> 00:43:08,516
<i>♫ So where are we now ♫</i>

563
00:43:10,340 --> 00:43:16,004
<i>♫ I want to hug you so badly ♫</i>

564
00:43:16,004 --> 00:43:20,068
<i>♫ I want to become better with you ♫</i>

565
00:43:21,316 --> 00:43:26,180
<i>♫ The youth we shared ♫</i>

566
00:43:26,180 --> 00:43:32,228
<i>♫ Turned into a rainbow within my heart ♫</i>

567
00:43:32,740 --> 00:43:38,308
<i>♫ I really want to warm you ♫</i>

568
00:43:38,308 --> 00:43:40,196
<i>♫ I want to share with you ♫</i>

569
00:43:40,196 --> 00:43:44,868
<i>♫ The beauty of the world ♫</i>

570
00:43:45,752 --> 00:43:47,972
<i>♫ We promised ♫</i>

571
00:43:48,548 --> 00:43:54,244
<i>♫ To never be apart ♫</i>

572
00:43:54,980 --> 00:44:00,682
<i>♫ Do you want to hear me sing ♫</i>

573
00:44:00,682 --> 00:44:05,444
<i>♫ The wind chime swaying in my heart ♫</i>

574
00:44:05,988 --> 00:44:10,212
<i>♫ Is a wish ♫</i>

575
00:44:10,948 --> 00:44:16,836
<i>♫ I secretly made for you ♫</i>

576
00:44:17,380 --> 00:44:22,916
<i>♫ I want to plant ♫</i>

577
00:44:22,916 --> 00:44:24,804
<i>♫ A red maple forest ♫</i>

578
00:44:24,804 --> 00:44:29,412
<i>♫ To dye the whole mountain red ♫</i>

579
00:44:30,340 --> 00:44:32,580
<i>♫ The sky after the rain ♫</i>

580
00:44:33,220 --> 00:44:38,148
<i>♫ Was painted by our brilliant dreams ♫</i>

581
00:44:45,028 --> 00:44:49,796
<i>♫ Time is a flower of dream ♫</i>

582
00:44:50,628 --> 00:44:55,714
<i>♫ You've already collected it ♫</i>

583
00:44:56,644 --> 00:45:00,644
<i>♫ When we all become better ♫</i>

584
00:45:02,116 --> 00:45:06,244
<i>♫ We'll see the best of the world together ♫</i>
