<i>[Episode 22 I'll Be There for You]</i>

19
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:36,200
There's a hemangioma on the liver.

20
00:01:37,159 --> 00:01:39,879
Normally, it wouldn't cause any pain.

21
00:01:39,879 --> 00:01:41,319
But it has grown too big.

22
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:43,232
Look,

23
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:46,079
it's already pressing against the organs,

24
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:47,959
posing a risk of rupture at any time.

25
00:01:47,959 --> 00:01:49,159
It needs to be removed as soon as possible.

26
00:01:51,079 --> 00:01:54,200
Actually, this isn't a complex surgery,

27
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:57,280
but its position is tricky,

28
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,439
right next to the aorta.

29
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:01,879
So, the surgery is risky.

30
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,159
You need to be mentally prepared.

31
00:02:21,675 --> 00:02:25,696
<i>[Shen Juan]</i>

32
00:02:27,479 --> 00:02:29,000
Training's over?

33
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,479
Have you packed your things?

34
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,599
<i>Yes, I have.</i>

35
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,039
<i>What's wrong with your voice?</i>

36
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,719
Nothing.

37
00:02:38,719 --> 00:02:40,439
Maybe the cold wind hurts my throat.

38
00:02:42,199 --> 00:02:43,240
<i>I'll come to you later.</i>

39
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:45,088
No.

40
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,800
My brother wants

41
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,080
to talk to me tonight.

42
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,264
I can't see you now.

43
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:52,639
I'll see you tomorrow and send you off.

44
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:55,120
<i>Alright, I'll wait for you.</i>

45
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,280
Bye.

46
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:05,039
Are you not going to tell him
about your mother's illness?

47
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,039
He's about to go for training,

48
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:12,719
preparing for the National University Games.

49
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:16,319
This is his first competition
since returning to the shooting field.

50
00:03:16,919 --> 00:03:18,319
It's very important to him.

51
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,439
He's put in a lot,

52
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,599
so I don't want to make him worry

53
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:24,639
at this critical moment.

54
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,879
It's alright. I'm here.

55
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,080
Mom,

56
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:57,280
if you need anything,
you can call me or the nurse.

57
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,752
You don't have to do it yourself.

58
00:03:58,752 --> 00:04:00,280
Don't make a fuss.

59
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,759
I can take care of myself.

60
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:06,759
How do you feel now?

61
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,512
Do you feel dizzy?

62
00:04:08,512 --> 00:04:09,632
Does your stomach hurt?

63
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:11,520
You tell the doctor

64
00:04:12,039 --> 00:04:13,400
to discharge me.

65
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:15,319
I want to go back to Huaicheng.

66
00:04:15,319 --> 00:04:16,839
You can't be discharged now.

67
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:18,879
There's a hemangioma on your liver.

68
00:04:18,879 --> 00:04:20,079
The doctor said

69
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:21,439
it needs to be surgically removed.

70
00:04:21,439 --> 00:04:22,759
No need.

71
00:04:22,759 --> 00:04:24,000
I know this disease very well.

72
00:04:24,519 --> 00:04:26,079
Conservative treatment is enough.

73
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:27,120
You knew it?

74
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,480
You've seen a doctor before, haven't you?

75
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:32,480
Then why didn't you tell me?

76
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,639
What's the point?

77
00:04:34,759 --> 00:04:37,000
It just makes you worry about me.

78
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,079
Do you know what it feels like

79
00:04:42,079 --> 00:04:44,720
to watch you fall in front of me?

80
00:04:45,959 --> 00:04:48,160
I never want to experience that kind

81
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,800
of despair again in my life.

82
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,800
Mom, not all diseases
can be treated conservatively.

83
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:02,920
The doctor said

84
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,240
under your current condition,

85
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,399
the hemangioma will grow bigger.

86
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:08,079
If you're worried about the risk of surgery,

87
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:10,112
we'll try to find the best doctor.

88
00:05:10,112 --> 00:05:11,584
That's not the point.

89
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:15,000
What I'm most worried about is you.

90
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:16,800
Your school work got worse,

91
00:05:17,399 --> 00:05:19,439
and you have such a bad boyfriend.

92
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,000
How can I have the surgery in peace?

93
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:25,199
Shen Juan is not what you think.

94
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,759
You've misunderstood him.

95
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:28,920
I only believe what I see.

96
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:32,120
Lin Yujing,

97
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,240
is it that I misunderstand him,

98
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,399
or are you obsessive?

99
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,079
What do you want?

100
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:40,192
Anyway, you must have the surgery.

101
00:05:40,192 --> 00:05:41,839
If you want me to do it,

102
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,519
you have to break up with Shen Juan.

103
00:05:54,279 --> 00:05:55,920
Are you forcing me to do this?

104
00:05:58,319 --> 00:05:59,959
It's you who's forcing me.

105
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,360
I've made it very clear to you.

106
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:08,279
You make your choice.

107
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,720
Shen Juan.

108
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,920
You don't look well. Are you alright?

109
00:07:09,439 --> 00:07:12,319
I didn't sleep well last night.

110
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:13,560
You could text me.

111
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,759
No need to see me off.

112
00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:15,920
How could I not?

113
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,399
You're going to be gone for a while.

114
00:07:17,399 --> 00:07:18,519
I must see you off.

115
00:07:20,279 --> 00:07:22,519
I've been busy training recently
and haven't had time to accompany you.

116
00:07:23,399 --> 00:07:25,680
I'm going for closed training.

117
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:26,800
I only have half an hour

118
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,839
to use the phone after daily training.

119
00:07:28,839 --> 00:07:30,759
No worries. I can take care of myself.

120
00:07:31,279 --> 00:07:32,279
You just focus on preparing

121
00:07:32,279 --> 00:07:33,279
for the National University Games.

122
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,839
I will give it my all.

123
00:07:38,279 --> 00:07:40,160
Shen Juan, it's time to depart.

124
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,640
Wait for my return.

125
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:06,304
Go down a bit more.

126
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:09,888
Hu.

127
00:08:10,839 --> 00:08:11,904
Lei.

128
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,639
You're still punctual as always.

129
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,399
Everybody, stop.

130
00:08:19,879 --> 00:08:22,399
This is Coach Lei
of the Pucheng University Shooting Team.

131
00:08:23,079 --> 00:08:24,672
The other three team members

132
00:08:24,672 --> 00:08:26,319
will be competing

133
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:28,439
with you

134
00:08:28,439 --> 00:08:29,680
in the 25-meter rapid fire event

135
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,720
at the National University Games.

136
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,039
In the coming period,

137
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:36,159
you guys will be trained together.

138
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,879
You are teammates, as well as competitors.

139
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:40,759
You should learn from each other

140
00:08:40,759 --> 00:08:41,840
and strive to surpass each other.

141
00:08:42,519 --> 00:08:44,519
- Got it?
- Yes.

142
00:08:45,679 --> 00:08:46,784
Well,

143
00:08:46,784 --> 00:08:48,512
you guys get acquainted with each other.

144
00:08:48,512 --> 00:08:50,639
Start acclimatization training after lunch.

145
00:08:51,159 --> 00:08:52,879
Gather here at two in the afternoon.

146
00:08:52,879 --> 00:08:54,639
Coach Lei and I

147
00:08:54,639 --> 00:08:56,279
will take turns instructing you.

148
00:08:56,279 --> 00:08:58,039
- Got it.
- Louder!

149
00:08:58,039 --> 00:08:59,120
Got it.

150
00:09:01,399 --> 00:09:03,240
Lei, it's your first time here, right?

151
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,480
Let me show you around.

152
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,519
Let's go.

153
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:08,352
Get to know each other.

154
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:12,919
Continue with training.

155
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,639
Why are we doing it again?

156
00:09:18,159 --> 00:09:19,744
Our coach just told us

157
00:09:19,744 --> 00:09:21,159
to get acquainted with each other first?

158
00:09:22,039 --> 00:09:23,559
I suggest

159
00:09:23,559 --> 00:09:26,000
we have a unique welcome ceremony.

160
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,040
How does that sound?

161
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,720
The welcome ceremony is simple.

162
00:09:34,279 --> 00:09:35,552
It's a duel between the two teams.

163
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:37,200
The top-ranked player

164
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,624
will compete first.

165
00:09:38,624 --> 00:09:41,080
There will be three fair rounds.

166
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,240
The winner continues

167
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,759
to face the second-ranked player
from the opposing team.

168
00:09:43,759 --> 00:09:46,720
Otherwise, the next player
from our team will take the stage.

169
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,600
Their shooting team

170
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,840
truly lives up to its reputation.

171
00:09:57,919 --> 00:09:59,360
Is this the level of the team captain?

172
00:10:00,039 --> 00:10:01,240
Their captain still needs more practice.

173
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:09,759
There's a gap

174
00:10:09,759 --> 00:10:10,879
between the captains.

175
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:22,000
It's okay. Don't be discouraged.

176
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,480
Our captain was the champion
of the last Provincial University Games.

177
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,759
You two only have a four-point difference.

178
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:27,879
Your skills are not bad at all.

179
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,616
Sui Yu, right?

180
00:10:40,799 --> 00:10:42,432
I heard that you were once selected

181
00:10:42,432 --> 00:10:43,759
for the National Junior Training Team.

182
00:10:44,279 --> 00:10:45,504
You are also the only one

183
00:10:45,504 --> 00:10:47,480
in the history of Jiangcheng University

184
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,320
who could be selected in your freshman year.

185
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,040
You are the seed player in your team,

186
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,320
apart from your captain.

187
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,360
Very impressive.

188
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,159
You've prepared quite well.

189
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:56,896
But it's not necessary.

190
00:10:57,559 --> 00:10:58,960
You'll know one's ability

191
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,360
once they lift the gun.

192
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:20,879
We'll be counting on you.

193
00:11:28,519 --> 00:11:29,759
I heard this kid

194
00:11:30,279 --> 00:11:31,879
seems to be quite capable.

195
00:11:31,879 --> 00:11:33,360
Let's see how he performs.

196
00:11:51,759 --> 00:11:52,896
Good.

197
00:11:54,159 --> 00:11:55,399
Let's get out of here.

198
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,440
Good for you.

199
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,799
Not giving me a chance to play.

200
00:12:08,799 --> 00:12:10,399
Boring. Let's go.

201
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:27,392
Lei.

202
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,559
To motivate your team members,

203
00:12:30,559 --> 00:12:32,679
you tried to make this joint training happen.

204
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,399
I'm afraid it will be counterproductive.

205
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,504
I'm telling you.

206
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,399
Do not underestimate my team members.

207
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,919
Who knows what will happen?

208
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,840
I have great confidence in them.

209
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:51,039
Alright, I'll just wait and see.

210
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:01,480
How was it? Any gains today?

211
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,600
You must be cursing me in your hearts now,

212
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:13,200
thinking that I'm mocking you, right?

213
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,520
Because you think

214
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:17,632
you have no gain but setbacks.

215
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:27,799
Listen to me.

216
00:13:28,799 --> 00:13:29,888
Sometimes,

217
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:32,360
setbacks can be the greatest gain.

218
00:13:33,879 --> 00:13:35,799
You've seen the gap between you and them.

219
00:13:36,519 --> 00:13:37,600
You understand it.

220
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,840
It's okay to lag a bit now.

221
00:13:41,799 --> 00:13:42,912
It's okay, really.

222
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,639
But you must get revenge for this defeat,

223
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:48,840
trying to win in the future competitions.

224
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:49,919
That would be impressive.

225
00:13:55,799 --> 00:13:57,279
Rest early today.

226
00:13:57,279 --> 00:13:59,424
You can get your phones later.

227
00:13:59,424 --> 00:14:00,720
Return them half an hour later.

228
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:03,240
No one is allowed
to be late for training tomorrow.

229
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,399
Understand?

230
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:05,399
Yes.

231
00:14:05,399 --> 00:14:06,400
Off you go.

232
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:06,759
Why not a video chat?

233
00:15:08,039 --> 00:15:10,159
I forgot to charge my electricity card today.

234
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:11,480
The dormitory is all dark.

235
00:15:12,159 --> 00:15:13,720
How was your training today?

236
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:15,679
I hear their shooting team is merciless.

237
00:15:16,919 --> 00:15:18,200
Indeed.

238
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,296
The gap is quite large.

239
00:15:20,039 --> 00:15:21,120
Don't push yourself too hard.

240
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:22,960
Good results accumulate over time.

241
00:15:23,679 --> 00:15:24,799
You just need time.

242
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:27,840
I know.

243
00:15:28,679 --> 00:15:30,848
What about you? What kept you busy today?

244
00:15:30,848 --> 00:15:33,279
<i>You even forgot to charge your card.</i>

245
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,639
Well,

246
00:15:35,639 --> 00:15:37,879
my brother bought me a big meal today.

247
00:15:37,879 --> 00:15:39,279
I was so happy that I forgot to charge

248
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:40,480
when I got back.

249
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:43,559
<i>You like it?</i>

250
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:46,159
After my competition ends,

251
00:15:46,159 --> 00:15:47,159
we can have a big meal together.

252
00:15:47,679 --> 00:15:48,832
Okay.

253
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:52,320
You must be tired after a day's training.

254
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,639
You should rest early.

255
00:15:53,639 --> 00:15:55,279
I won't bother you anymore.

256
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:57,240
<i>Okay, you should also rest early.</i>

257
00:15:57,799 --> 00:15:59,159
Goodnight.

258
00:15:59,159 --> 00:16:00,224
Bye.

259
00:16:12,872 --> 00:16:15,072
<i>[Inpatient Department]</i>

260
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:18,304
You're here.

261
00:16:20,799 --> 00:16:23,279
Your mother's blood indicators
have finally stabilized.

262
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:27,840
But as long as the surgery is not performed,
the risk still exists.

263
00:16:28,759 --> 00:16:30,240
I'll tell her about this.

264
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,519
In addition to this,
the patient needs to rest well.

265
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:34,759
During this time,

266
00:16:34,759 --> 00:16:36,519
she can't get emotional.

267
00:16:38,799 --> 00:16:39,808
Okay.

268
00:17:14,039 --> 00:17:15,488
Mom,

269
00:17:15,488 --> 00:17:16,544
I've thought it through.

270
00:17:17,759 --> 00:17:19,039
I agree to break up with Shen Juan.

271
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:28,039
But he's in a training now.

272
00:17:28,039 --> 00:17:29,400
I don't want to affect him.

273
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,712
So, I'll break up with him

274
00:17:31,712 --> 00:17:32,832
after his competition is over.

275
00:17:33,799 --> 00:17:35,240
Can you agree to the surgery now?

276
00:17:43,319 --> 00:17:44,880
If you are silent,

277
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:45,960
I'll take it as a yes.

278
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,759
I'll talk to the doctor
about the surgery schedule.

279
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,240
Why are you in the library?

280
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,519
You didn't answer my call.

281
00:18:13,359 --> 00:18:14,640
I'm looking up some medical information.

282
00:18:15,279 --> 00:18:16,640
What the doctor said is true.

283
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:17,960
The risk of surgery is too high.

284
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:19,039
As soon as the artery is touched,

285
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:20,160
there will be a risk to life.

286
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:22,839
I'm about to tell you about this.

287
00:18:23,599 --> 00:18:24,640
My mom has a friend,

288
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:25,920
named He Zhonghua.

289
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,079
He's the top surgeon

290
00:18:27,079 --> 00:18:28,279
of the liver surgery department in Pucheng.

291
00:18:28,279 --> 00:18:30,400
I found he successfully

292
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,568
performed similar surgery.

293
00:18:33,568 --> 00:18:36,192
So, if we could have him as the lead surgeon,

294
00:18:36,192 --> 00:18:38,119
the surgery risks
would be significantly reduced.

295
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,359
If you agree,

296
00:18:42,759 --> 00:18:44,440
I will talk to my mom tonight.

297
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:45,599
Of course, I agree.

298
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,759
But it's about my mom.

299
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:51,759
I should talk to my dad first.

300
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:55,808
Okay.

301
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:07,960
Yujing, how did you get here?

302
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:10,119
The risk of this surgery is very high,

303
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:12,599
so we can't afford any mishaps.

304
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,000
I remember

305
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,240
Aunt Guan has a friend

306
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:18,599
who's an authority in hepatic surgery.

307
00:19:19,279 --> 00:19:20,680
Could you ask him

308
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,920
to perform this surgery on my mom.

309
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:29,839
Did your mom know you came to me?

310
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,359
You know her very well.

311
00:19:39,079 --> 00:19:42,440
If she knew I found the doctor for her,

312
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:44,064
she would definitely not accept it.

313
00:19:44,064 --> 00:19:45,400
So, we should keep it from her for now.

314
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,519
The focus now is
to coax her into having the surgery.

315
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,280
What's wrong?

316
00:19:57,799 --> 00:19:59,039
You can't help?

317
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:03,744
Do you know

318
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:06,839
how hard it is to ask someone for a favor?

319
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:08,759
Besides,

320
00:20:08,759 --> 00:20:10,960
that's your Aunt Guan's friend.

321
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,599
I've only asked you twice.

322
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,480
In my second year of high school,
I begged you to let me stay,

323
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:16,599
but you refused.

324
00:20:17,839 --> 00:20:19,240
This time it's about my mom's life.

325
00:20:21,079 --> 00:20:23,440
Is your face more important than her life?

326
00:20:50,119 --> 00:20:51,200
You're back.

327
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,039
Dinner is ready.

328
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:56,160
I cooked your favorite food.

329
00:20:57,799 --> 00:20:58,880
Come.

330
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:04,559
It took three hours.

331
00:21:07,079 --> 00:21:08,096
Try it.

332
00:21:11,559 --> 00:21:12,640
How is it?

333
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:15,488
Delicious.

334
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,272
Meng,

335
00:21:23,079 --> 00:21:24,599
is something going on?

336
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:28,920
No, nothing.

337
00:21:30,599 --> 00:21:32,279
Just tell me.

338
00:21:32,279 --> 00:21:33,279
Don't be hesitating.

339
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,288
What's going on?

340
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:41,600
Well,

341
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:43,488
Lin Yujing came

342
00:21:44,119 --> 00:21:45,319
to see me today.

343
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:47,720
She said

344
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:50,599
Lin Zhi has a hemangioma on her liver.

345
00:21:51,519 --> 00:21:52,599
What?

346
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,432
Is it serious?

347
00:21:55,799 --> 00:21:57,200
She said it's quite serious.

348
00:21:58,079 --> 00:21:59,319
The hemangioma

349
00:22:00,119 --> 00:22:01,759
is located near an artery,

350
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:04,000
so the surgery risk is very high.

351
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,400
A regular doctor couldn't handle it.

352
00:22:07,759 --> 00:22:09,079
I remember

353
00:22:09,759 --> 00:22:10,976
you have a friend,

354
00:22:10,976 --> 00:22:12,519
who married

355
00:22:12,519 --> 00:22:13,599
a famous hepatic surgery doctor.

356
00:22:14,319 --> 00:22:15,559
Could you

357
00:22:15,559 --> 00:22:16,559
help me ask

358
00:22:17,079 --> 00:22:18,528
if he could squeeze in a surgery

359
00:22:18,528 --> 00:22:21,160
for Lin Zhi in his schedule?

360
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:27,160
Okay, I'll make a call.

361
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,120
Xiangmei,

362
00:22:29,952 --> 00:22:31,039
thank you.

363
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,039
Lin Zhi is my ex-wife.

364
00:22:34,599 --> 00:22:35,680
I know

365
00:22:36,279 --> 00:22:37,960
I shouldn't ask you for this.

366
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,119
What are you talking about?

367
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,160
This is a matter of life and death.

368
00:22:45,279 --> 00:22:46,400
besides, Yujing

369
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,559
must be very anxious.

370
00:22:48,079 --> 00:22:49,480
We should help as much as we can.

371
00:22:53,279 --> 00:22:54,759
I'm going to make the call.

372
00:22:54,759 --> 00:22:55,872
Don't worry.

373
00:23:14,319 --> 00:23:15,599
Yujing.

374
00:23:15,599 --> 00:23:17,759
<i>I have already contacted the doctor.</i>

375
00:23:17,759 --> 00:23:18,759
<i>Well,</i>

376
00:23:18,759 --> 00:23:20,960
<i>you take a picture</i>

377
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,079
<i>of your mom's medical examination report.</i>

378
00:23:22,079 --> 00:23:23,079
Take a clear picture,

379
00:23:23,079 --> 00:23:24,400
and send it to me.

380
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,079
I'll send it to the doctor first.

381
00:23:26,079 --> 00:23:27,400
Okay, I'll send it to you right away.

382
00:23:29,559 --> 00:23:30,799
Dad,

383
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:33,480
thank you.

384
00:23:37,839 --> 00:23:40,200
Take good care of yourself.

385
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,599
Remember to eat on time, alright?

386
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:45,664
Okay.

387
00:23:56,559 --> 00:23:58,359
<i>Brother, problem solved.</i>

388
00:24:21,559 --> 00:24:23,119
This is your future training plan.

389
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,759
Regardless of training programs,
rank matches will be held daily for each.

390
00:24:27,559 --> 00:24:29,880
The top five performers will be placed
in group A, competing in the morning.

391
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,559
The rest will be in group B,

392
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:33,984
competing in the afternoon.

393
00:24:33,984 --> 00:24:36,359
The next day, the ranks will be rearranged
based on the first day's scores.

394
00:24:38,359 --> 00:24:39,392
Are you scared now?

395
00:24:40,079 --> 00:24:41,160
I'm telling you.

396
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:43,680
The real competition will be more brutal.

397
00:24:44,609 --> 00:24:49,055
<i>[10 Shen Juan]</i>

398
00:25:02,418 --> 00:25:05,703
<i>[9 Shen Juan]</i>

399
00:25:40,756 --> 00:25:43,134
<i>[8 Shen Juan]</i>

400
00:26:40,352 --> 00:26:44,992
<i>[6 Shen Juan]</i>

401
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:20,680
Why hasn't the nurse come
for the ward round today?

402
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:21,720
I'll go ask.

403
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:22,799
No need.

404
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:24,880
I'm not sleepy yet. I can wait.

405
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:48,599
You seem in good spirits today.

406
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:51,799
- How's your appetite and sleeping?
- Pretty good.

407
00:27:51,799 --> 00:27:53,720
- Let me measure your blood pressure.
- Okay.

408
00:27:54,304 --> 00:27:55,392
Alright.

409
00:28:08,359 --> 00:28:09,480
Who is it?

410
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:10,599
A classmate called.

411
00:28:14,039 --> 00:28:16,200
Everything is normal. Get more rest.

412
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:17,248
Okay, thank you.

413
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:28,799
Tomorrow's medicine hasn't arrived yet.

414
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:29,960
I'll go check it out.

415
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:59,319
I was in the library just now.
It wasn't convenient to answer the phone.

416
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,079
Why are you in a convenience store?
Aren't you going back to the dormitory?

417
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:07,480
I was a little hungry and bought something.

418
00:29:09,319 --> 00:29:10,599
It's quite late.

419
00:29:10,599 --> 00:29:12,000
Don't stay outside alone.

420
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:14,559
How's your training going?

421
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:17,400
It's okay, you should go back early.

422
00:29:19,519 --> 00:29:20,608
Bye.

423
00:29:21,839 --> 00:29:22,880
Bye.

424
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:31,759
<i>I was in the library just now.
It wasn't convenient to answer the phone.</i>

425
00:29:58,039 --> 00:29:59,279
Shen Juan?

426
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:00,759
<i>I have something to ask you.</i>

427
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:03,872
Does anything happen to Lin Yujing?

428
00:30:03,872 --> 00:30:05,319
<i>I feel like she's hiding something from me.</i>

429
00:30:08,279 --> 00:30:09,344
Well,

430
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:11,240
her mother is sick.

431
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,039
<i>She's in the hospital now.</i>

432
00:30:16,519 --> 00:30:17,600
No way.

433
00:30:18,359 --> 00:30:19,960
From the training till now,

434
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:21,696
your performance has been steadily improving.

435
00:30:21,696 --> 00:30:23,279
You're just a step away
from making it to group A.

436
00:30:24,119 --> 00:30:26,240
Why are you asking for leave at this time?

437
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,480
I'm only asking for one day off.

438
00:30:28,119 --> 00:30:29,240
I'll definitely be back tomorrow.

439
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:31,319
I promise

440
00:30:31,319 --> 00:30:32,440
it won't delay the subsequent training.

441
00:30:33,079 --> 00:30:34,160
In rapid-fire competitions,

442
00:30:34,839 --> 00:30:36,759
a moment's negligence
can lead to a complete loss.

443
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,008
How can you guarantee?

444
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:41,519
You're already at a disadvantage
compared to others.

445
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:44,480
The only thing
you can rely on now is focus and persistence.

446
00:30:45,519 --> 00:30:46,528
Can you promise anything?

447
00:30:48,279 --> 00:30:49,359
Shen Juan.

448
00:30:49,359 --> 00:30:50,880
It was okay when you asked for leave before.

449
00:30:51,759 --> 00:30:53,920
But at this critical moment,
you're dropping the ball.

450
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:56,480
Have you forgotten what you told me
before you joined the team?

451
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:57,536
I haven't.

452
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:00,279
But I really have an important matter

453
00:31:00,279 --> 00:31:01,344
to deal with.

454
00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:03,840
Coach.

455
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:06,016
No matter what,

456
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:08,039
please allow me this time.

457
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:09,792
It's my last time.

458
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:16,192
Fine.

459
00:31:17,119 --> 00:31:18,599
Okay.

460
00:31:18,599 --> 00:31:19,744
You can take one day off.

461
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:21,480
But you must promise

462
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:22,920
you'll get into group A when you're back.

463
00:31:23,559 --> 00:31:24,559
If you can't do it,

464
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,480
leave the shooting team at once.

465
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:28,720
Our spots are limited.

466
00:31:29,319 --> 00:31:30,440
If you don't cherish it,

467
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:32,559
give the opportunity to others.

468
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:33,632
Is that okay?

469
00:31:34,359 --> 00:31:35,360
Fine.

470
00:31:36,759 --> 00:31:37,799
Thank you, Coach Lei.

471
00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:04,064
<i>The expert has already agreed</i>

472
00:32:04,064 --> 00:32:05,088
<i>to perform your mom's surgery.</i>

473
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:08,000
<i>I just sent you</i>

474
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,799
<i>his next two months' available time slots.</i>

475
00:32:09,799 --> 00:32:11,456
<i>You can discuss it with your current doctor.</i>

476
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:22,559
What's wrong?

477
00:32:25,559 --> 00:32:26,624
What is this?

478
00:32:28,359 --> 00:32:29,519
You asked Meng Weiguo for help?

479
00:32:31,119 --> 00:32:32,920
He knows a liver surgery expert.

480
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:35,079
I asked him for a referral.

481
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,119
Don't think about it.

482
00:32:38,119 --> 00:32:39,240
I won't have the surgery.

483
00:32:40,119 --> 00:32:41,696
I won't take any favor

484
00:32:41,696 --> 00:32:42,880
from Meng Weiguo.

485
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,839
So, what do you want me to do?

486
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:52,720
I've done everything I could.

487
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,480
I have no choice.

488
00:32:55,599 --> 00:32:57,920
What I did is to make your surgery successful.

489
00:32:57,920 --> 00:33:00,039
As long as you're fine, I can do anything,

490
00:33:00,039 --> 00:33:01,440
let alone turning to Meng Weiguo for help.

491
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,759
I just want you to be healthy.

492
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:07,480
Don't tell me these sweet words here.

493
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:10,759
If you really care about me,

494
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:12,880
you shouldn't do this.

495
00:33:21,839 --> 00:33:23,759
Are you hiding a lot from me?

496
00:33:26,079 --> 00:33:27,880
Is your breakup with Shen Juan a lie?

497
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:31,519
You fooled me,

498
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:34,519
didn't you?

499
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:43,776
Are you alright?

500
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:46,880
- Mom.
- Don't touch me.

501
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:49,880
I don't have a daughter like you.

502
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:51,880
I don't have a daughter like you.
Get out of here.

503
00:33:56,079 --> 00:33:57,160
Out.

504
00:34:17,559 --> 00:34:18,559
Lin Yujing.

505
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:41,159
It's okay.

506
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:42,208
I'm back.

507
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:43,719
I'm with you.

508
00:35:01,519 --> 00:35:03,400
My mom's surgery is very risky.

509
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:06,559
I asked my dad
to contact a more experienced doctor

510
00:35:06,559 --> 00:35:07,559
to perform the surgery for her.

511
00:35:08,119 --> 00:35:09,159
She found it out.

512
00:35:10,519 --> 00:35:11,840
She agreed before,

513
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:14,079
but now she changed her mind.

514
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:25,480
People's thoughts

515
00:35:26,559 --> 00:35:27,599
can change.

516
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,599
Your mom refuses to have the surgery now,

517
00:35:31,679 --> 00:35:32,768
but maybe later,

518
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:34,760
she will change her mind again.

519
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:57,239
Why are your hands so cold?

520
00:36:03,039 --> 00:36:04,320
I'll go get you a hot beverage.

521
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:06,368
I'll be right back.

522
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:23,559
Hello. I'm Shen Juan. I'm Lin--

523
00:37:23,559 --> 00:37:24,608
I know who you are.

524
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:27,719
Beyond that,

525
00:37:27,719 --> 00:37:30,019
I know you didn't study well in high school

526
00:37:30,019 --> 00:37:31,136
and ran a shop.

527
00:37:31,719 --> 00:37:33,000
You got suspended

528
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,639
from school for fighting.

529
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:37,440
Now, you're working on the rapid fire.

530
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:38,464
Is that right?

531
00:37:41,079 --> 00:37:43,159
Is this how you take responsibility
for your own life?

532
00:37:44,199 --> 00:37:46,039
I wonder how your parents educated you.

533
00:37:46,719 --> 00:37:48,760
Lin Yujing trusted you because she's naive.

534
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:52,559
What I regret most now is
that I left her in Pucheng back then,

535
00:37:52,559 --> 00:37:54,039
giving you the chance to approach her.

536
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:57,360
This won't happen again.

537
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:01,000
- Break up with her.
- I can't.

538
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,880
You've already held my daughter back.

539
00:38:03,679 --> 00:38:06,119
She could have gone to a better university,

540
00:38:06,119 --> 00:38:08,000
but she gave it up because of you.

541
00:38:09,159 --> 00:38:10,480
Ever since she was in love with you,

542
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:12,400
she skipped school, deceived me,

543
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:13,800
and lied to me.

544
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:15,800
Have you ever thought
about why she would lie to you?

545
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,000
Ms. Lin.

546
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:21,568
Lin Yujing is my daughter.

547
00:38:21,568 --> 00:38:24,440
If she does something wrong,
correcting her is my responsibility.

548
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:26,480
What right do you have to judge me?

549
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:37,888
You may leave.

550
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:46,784
Ms. Lin.

551
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:50,960
I'm not here to blame you,

552
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:54,599
but to make you understand

553
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:56,760
how much your daughter loves you,

554
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:58,639
and how much she cares about you.

555
00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:03,400
I could meet Lin Yujing

556
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,400
not because she transferred to my school
and became my deskmate.

557
00:39:09,039 --> 00:39:11,480
It was because she came
to my store to fix a bracelet.

558
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:15,559
This bracelet is very important to her,

559
00:39:15,559 --> 00:39:17,199
because you gave it to her.

560
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:21,239
<i>Haven't you always liked this bracelet?</i>

561
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:24,639
<i>Your grandma gave it to me</i>

562
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:27,079
<i>when I came of age.</i>

563
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:29,159
<i>I'm giving it to you today.</i>

564
00:39:31,239 --> 00:39:33,599
<i>You need to be sensible, understand?</i>

565
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:59,719
You might think Lin Yujing is wrong,

566
00:39:59,719 --> 00:40:00,719
but in my view,

567
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:03,719
you don't understand your daughter at all.

568
00:40:19,239 --> 00:40:20,639
As I know,

569
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:23,320
Lin Yujing has her own ideas

570
00:40:24,199 --> 00:40:25,400
and knows her own mind.

571
00:40:26,559 --> 00:40:27,679
Whatever happens,

572
00:40:27,679 --> 00:40:28,880
she takes it on herself.

573
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:31,079
She never asks anyone for help,

574
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:33,152
nor does she complain.

575
00:40:33,152 --> 00:40:34,760
I admire her character,

576
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:38,400
but I also feel sorry for her

577
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:42,304
because I know

578
00:40:42,304 --> 00:40:43,519
she will have to suffer a lot

579
00:40:45,079 --> 00:40:47,039
to become that kind of person.

580
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:55,040
So,

581
00:40:56,599 --> 00:40:58,039
When Lin Yujing asked her father

582
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,360
to find a doctor for you,

583
00:41:01,079 --> 00:41:03,119
do you know how much courage it took her?

584
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:05,360
Why would she do that?

585
00:41:08,159 --> 00:41:09,199
Because she loves you,

586
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:11,520
cares about you,

587
00:41:12,519 --> 00:41:13,920
and doesn't want to lose you.

588
00:41:25,039 --> 00:41:26,400
When I was little,

589
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:29,480
my parents were not by my side

590
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:30,519
because of work.

591
00:41:31,679 --> 00:41:33,719
I was raised by my uncle,
who owns the jewelry store.

592
00:41:37,559 --> 00:41:39,039
When I was in my first year of high school,

593
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:42,840
my uncle got into a car accident on his way

594
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:46,119
to watch my rapid-fire competition.

595
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:50,920
He became a vegetative state.

596
00:41:53,679 --> 00:41:55,039
All these years, I have been living

597
00:41:55,039 --> 00:41:56,159
in regret

598
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:58,199
and guilt

599
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:00,800
until I met Lin Yujing.

600
00:42:03,639 --> 00:42:04,760
She healed me

601
00:42:06,599 --> 00:42:08,199
gave me the confidence.

602
00:42:08,199 --> 00:42:09,599
to pursue my dreams.

603
00:42:10,519 --> 00:42:11,800
I understand

604
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:13,519
the pain of helplessness

605
00:42:14,119 --> 00:42:15,639
after losing a loved one.

606
00:42:16,519 --> 00:42:17,880
So when I see Lin Yujing

607
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:19,320
running around and so upset

608
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:20,960
for your illness,

609
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:23,599
my heart hurts.

610
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:27,920
So, I hope

611
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:31,599
you can consider it

612
00:42:33,039 --> 00:42:34,119
think more for her,

613
00:42:36,599 --> 00:42:37,599
and accept her request.

614
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:51,360
Ms. Lin.

615
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:53,159
I've said all I wanted to say.

616
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:56,079
Hope you will be well soon.

617
00:43:08,199 --> 00:43:09,679
<i>It was you</i>

618
00:43:09,679 --> 00:43:11,440
<i>who taught me the meaning of companionship.</i>

619
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:12,960
<i>It's not about leaving each other alone</i>

620
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:15,320
<i>but about sharing joy together.</i>

621
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:16,880
<i>When we're sad,</i>

622
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:18,039
<i>we can be there</i>

623
00:43:18,039 --> 00:43:19,360
<i>for each other.</i>

624
00:43:31,941 --> 00:43:36,485
<i>♫ Love sprouts in my palm ♫</i>

625
00:43:37,797 --> 00:43:41,637
<i>♫ Yet worried linger within my eyes ♫</i>

626
00:43:43,429 --> 00:43:48,005
<i>♫ Our story hasn't ended ♫</i>

627
00:43:48,933 --> 00:43:52,613
<i>♫ So where are we now ♫</i>

628
00:43:54,437 --> 00:44:00,101
<i>♫ I want to hug you so badly ♫</i>

629
00:44:00,101 --> 00:44:04,165
<i>♫ I want to become better with you ♫</i>

630
00:44:05,413 --> 00:44:10,277
<i>♫ The youth we shared ♫</i>

631
00:44:10,277 --> 00:44:16,325
<i>♫ Turned into a rainbow within my heart ♫</i>

632
00:44:16,837 --> 00:44:22,405
<i>♫ I really want to warm you ♫</i>

633
00:44:22,405 --> 00:44:24,293
<i>♫ I want to share with you ♫</i>

634
00:44:24,293 --> 00:44:28,965
<i>♫ The beauty of the world ♫</i>

635
00:44:29,849 --> 00:44:32,069
<i>♫ We promised ♫</i>

636
00:44:32,645 --> 00:44:38,341
<i>♫ To never be apart ♫</i>

637
00:44:39,077 --> 00:44:44,779
<i>♫ Do you want to hear me sing ♫</i>

638
00:44:44,779 --> 00:44:49,541
<i>♫ The wind chime swaying in my heart ♫</i>

639
00:44:50,085 --> 00:44:54,309
<i>♫ Is a wish ♫</i>

640
00:44:55,045 --> 00:45:00,933
<i>♫ I secretly made for you ♫</i>

641
00:45:01,477 --> 00:45:07,013
<i>♫ I want to plant ♫</i>

642
00:45:07,013 --> 00:45:08,901
<i>♫ A red maple forest ♫</i>

643
00:45:08,901 --> 00:45:13,509
<i>♫ To dye the whole mountain red ♫</i>

644
00:45:14,437 --> 00:45:16,677
<i>♫ The sky after the rain ♫</i>

645
00:45:17,317 --> 00:45:22,245
<i>♫ Was painted by our brilliant dreams ♫</i>

646
00:45:29,125 --> 00:45:33,893
<i>♫ Time is a flower of dream ♫</i>

647
00:45:34,725 --> 00:45:39,811
<i>♫ You've already collected it ♫</i>

648
00:45:40,741 --> 00:45:44,741
<i>♫ When we all become better ♫</i>

649
00:45:46,213 --> 00:45:50,341
<i>♫ We'll see the best of the world together ♫</i>
