00:01:40,845 --> 00:01:41,924
You're about to graduate,

20
00:01:42,845 --> 00:01:44,084
but your GPA isn't high enough.

21
00:01:44,684 --> 00:01:46,645
There are several courses you need to retake.

22
00:01:46,645 --> 00:01:48,325
Even if you pass the retakes,

23
00:01:48,325 --> 00:01:49,865
your credits are still insufficient.

24
00:01:49,865 --> 00:01:51,125
In your case,

25
00:01:51,845 --> 00:01:53,245
you can only delay graduation by a year.

26
00:01:53,245 --> 00:01:54,804
I have to stay here for another year?

27
00:01:54,804 --> 00:01:56,785
Yes, and that is the best-case scenario.

28
00:01:56,785 --> 00:01:57,905
If your credits are still

29
00:01:57,905 --> 00:01:59,245
insufficient next year,

30
00:01:59,245 --> 00:02:01,484
be prepared to receive
a certificate of course completion.

31
00:02:01,484 --> 00:02:03,265
- Sir…
- Alright, put yourself together.

32
00:02:03,265 --> 00:02:05,145
If you don't want just to complete the course,

33
00:02:05,145 --> 00:02:06,505
go back and prepare well for the next semester.

34
00:02:06,505 --> 00:02:07,665
Pass the exams,

35
00:02:07,665 --> 00:02:09,025
improve your GPA,

36
00:02:09,025 --> 00:02:10,625
and strive to earn enough credits

37
00:02:10,625 --> 00:02:12,044
to graduate smoothly next year, okay?

38
00:02:24,084 --> 00:02:25,141
Jiu!

00:02:25,684 --> 00:02:27,325

00:02:27,325 --> 00:02:28,385
I'm on my way home.

00:02:28,385 --> 00:02:29,461
What's up?

42
00:02:30,365 --> 00:02:31,645
<i>How's your graduation going?</i>

43
00:02:33,404 --> 00:02:35,985
Don't mention it. My teacher asked me to
delay graduation by a year.

44
00:02:35,985 --> 00:02:37,164
But don't worry,

45
00:02:37,765 --> 00:02:38,825
even if I delay graduation by a year,
it won't delay

46
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:40,164

00:02:44,424 --> 00:02:45,725

<i>class and exam schedules?</i>

51
00:02:48,125 --> 00:02:50,525
It won't. Don't worry.

52
00:02:50,525 --> 00:02:52,364
Remember the content

53
00:02:52,364 --> 00:02:53,404
of our selection

54
00:02:54,044 --> 00:02:55,345
that I sent you before?

55
00:02:55,345 --> 00:02:56,785
As long as we arrange our schedule

56
00:02:56,785 --> 00:02:57,825
according to that plan,

57
00:02:57,825 --> 00:02:59,005
there won't be any clash.

58
00:03:00,444 --> 00:03:01,785
<i>You're confident,</i>

59
00:03:01,785 --> 00:03:03,164
<i>but I'm not.</i>

60
00:03:03,885 --> 00:03:06,085
<i>My account has more followers than yours.</i>

61
00:03:06,085 --> 00:03:07,645
<i>The whole business partnership thing</i>

62
00:03:07,645 --> 00:03:09,924
<i>is just me being kind,
wanting to give you a hand.</i>

63
00:03:10,725 --> 00:03:12,965
<i>After all this,
I even have to adapt to your schedule.</i>

64
00:03:13,564 --> 00:03:16,884
<i>So why should I partner with you
and drag myself down?</i>

65
00:03:17,844 --> 00:03:18,933
Hold on.

66
00:03:19,644 --> 00:03:21,205
You were the one who wanted to
partner up in the first place.

67
00:03:21,205 --> 00:03:23,405
Now you're saying that
you were being kind to me?

68
00:03:24,644 --> 00:03:25,885
Go to hell!

69
00:03:25,885 --> 00:03:27,185
Do whatever you want.

70
00:03:27,185 --> 00:03:28,604
I don't need you.

71
00:03:29,165 --> 00:03:30,485
What a lunatic!

72
00:03:43,245 --> 00:03:44,265
Hello.

73
00:03:44,265 --> 00:03:45,685
Is this place for rent?

74
00:03:45,685 --> 00:03:47,805
No, it's not. It's about to be demolished.

75
00:03:47,805 --> 00:03:49,084
The whole street is going to be torn down.

76
00:04:06,604 --> 00:04:07,804
How's the judicial exam?

77
00:04:08,405 --> 00:04:09,405
Don't mention it.

78
00:04:09,405 --> 00:04:11,364
I hadn't prepared well and got wrecked.

79
00:04:14,044 --> 00:04:15,645
Why are you sighing too?

80
00:04:15,645 --> 00:04:16,685
What's wrong?

81
00:04:17,925 --> 00:04:20,085
Not me. It's a good friend of mine.

82
00:04:20,085 --> 00:04:23,164
Her boyfriend got a job offer
from a company in his hometown,

83
00:04:23,164 --> 00:04:24,365
but she got into

84
00:04:24,365 --> 00:04:25,564
graduate school at her current university.

85
00:04:26,324 --> 00:04:27,365
Her boyfriend thinks

86
00:04:27,365 --> 00:04:29,525
long-distance relationships have no future,
so he wants to break up with her.

87
00:04:30,205 --> 00:04:31,604
She's been crying for days,

88
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:33,085
and no matter how I try to comfort her,
she just can't stop being sad.

89
00:04:33,085 --> 00:04:35,865
But long-distance relationships are
indeed a big challenge in love.

90
00:04:35,865 --> 00:04:37,045
When two people's schedules

91
00:04:37,045 --> 00:04:38,165
don't align,

92
00:04:38,165 --> 00:04:39,865
even if they video call every day,

93
00:04:39,865 --> 00:04:41,365
it's still quite hard.

94
00:04:41,365 --> 00:04:43,545
Yeah, that's what I told her too.

95
00:04:43,545 --> 00:04:44,565
How can long-distance relationship

96
00:04:44,565 --> 00:04:46,345
create any beauty of distance?

97
00:04:46,345 --> 00:04:47,665
All it can create

98
00:04:47,665 --> 00:04:50,445
are couples who break up helplessly.

99
00:05:00,364 --> 00:05:02,145
<i>You guys go ahead and eat. I can't make it.</i>

100
00:05:02,145 --> 00:05:03,425
<i>I'm at the provincial team,</i>

101
00:05:03,425 --> 00:05:04,885
<i>picking up next week's training schedule.</i>

102
00:05:04,885 --> 00:05:06,644
<i>They said they're going to
throw me a welcome party.</i>

103
00:05:07,965 --> 00:05:09,204
<i>I was just about to tell you guys.</i>

104
00:05:09,204 --> 00:05:11,204
<i>Just before getting off work,
there was a situation in the lab.</i>

105
00:05:11,204 --> 00:05:12,825
<i>My boss asked us to stay and troubleshoot.</i>

106
00:05:12,825 --> 00:05:14,405
<i>I don't know how long it will take.</i>

107
00:05:14,405 --> 00:05:15,604
<i>Why don't you guys start first?</i>

108
00:05:15,604 --> 00:05:16,844
<i>I'll come over later.</i>

109
00:05:20,564 --> 00:05:23,185
Hey, why are you drinking so much?

110
00:05:23,185 --> 00:05:24,525
You didn't even leave me any.

111
00:05:25,884 --> 00:05:26,925
Wow. You actually made it.

112
00:05:27,925 --> 00:05:30,405
Hey, we'll have two beers, please. Thank you.

113
00:05:30,965 --> 00:05:32,065
Two beers, right?

114
00:05:32,065 --> 00:05:33,109
Don't bother.

115
00:05:36,364 --> 00:05:37,365
Here you go.

116
00:05:42,205 --> 00:05:43,405
What's the point of keeping them?

117
00:05:44,124 --> 00:05:45,364
No one would drink these beers.

118
00:05:46,844 --> 00:05:48,324
Everyone is busy.

119
00:05:48,324 --> 00:05:50,005
Busy with work.

120
00:05:50,005 --> 00:05:51,284
Busy with training.

121
00:05:52,044 --> 00:05:53,604
Busy making new friends.

122
00:05:54,364 --> 00:05:56,044
Only I have nothing to do.

123
00:05:57,324 --> 00:05:58,564
My beers are not good enough for them.

124
00:05:59,284 --> 00:06:00,365
Don't say that.

125
00:06:00,365 --> 00:06:02,284
They really are busy today and can't make it.

126
00:06:11,324 --> 00:06:12,341
Lin Yujing,

127
00:06:13,445 --> 00:06:14,644
are you going to tell them?

128
00:06:16,044 --> 00:06:17,485
I'm telling you,

129
00:06:17,485 --> 00:06:19,324
if you send this message,

130
00:06:20,205 --> 00:06:21,364
we'll no longer be buddies.

131
00:06:21,901 --> 00:06:23,101
No, I'm just…

132
00:06:23,661 --> 00:06:25,702
Gu Xia sent me a WeChat message,
and I'm replying to her.

133
00:06:25,702 --> 00:06:27,422
Don't worry, today,

134
00:06:27,422 --> 00:06:28,861
I'm definitely on your side.

135
00:06:31,101 --> 00:06:33,081
Lin Yujing, they probably
don't know what I've done.

136
00:06:33,081 --> 00:06:34,302
But you?

137
00:06:34,302 --> 00:06:36,662
Whenever they were in need,

138
00:06:36,662 --> 00:06:37,982
I was always the first

139
00:06:37,982 --> 00:06:39,782
to treat them wholeheartedly.

140
00:06:39,782 --> 00:06:40,922
Right?

141
00:06:40,922 --> 00:06:42,022
But what about them?

142
00:06:43,742 --> 00:06:45,402
They promised to drink together,

143
00:06:45,402 --> 00:06:46,821
yet neither of them came.

144
00:06:47,861 --> 00:06:50,101
I treat them as brothers.
But how did they treat me?

145
00:06:51,262 --> 00:06:52,502
Is this what brothers do?

146
00:07:05,821 --> 00:07:06,950
You know what?

147
00:07:09,341 --> 00:07:10,462
The old street is going to be demolished.

148
00:07:12,502 --> 00:07:13,742
The silverware store is gone.

149
00:07:16,341 --> 00:07:18,542
I've negotiated with the agent.

150
00:07:19,141 --> 00:07:20,142
I asked him

151
00:07:20,142 --> 00:07:21,542
if we could borrow
the silverware store on the 28th.

152
00:07:21,542 --> 00:07:22,542
Just for one day.

153
00:07:23,061 --> 00:07:24,182
The agent said it's possible.

154
00:07:24,942 --> 00:07:26,142
I invited you out today

155
00:07:26,142 --> 00:07:27,382
because I wanted to

156
00:07:27,382 --> 00:07:28,682
talk with you about

157
00:07:28,682 --> 00:07:29,682
what we should do

158
00:07:29,682 --> 00:07:31,101
on the 28th.

159
00:07:32,422 --> 00:07:33,478
But now?

160
00:07:35,141 --> 00:07:36,166
No one came.

161
00:07:43,061 --> 00:07:44,422
Am I being too sentimental?

162
00:07:47,982 --> 00:07:49,142
Don't overthink.

163
00:07:49,142 --> 00:07:50,262
They really are busy today,

164
00:07:50,262 --> 00:07:51,322
and that's why they can't make it.

165
00:07:51,322 --> 00:07:55,381
- But I believe…
- I get it. Now,

166
00:07:56,982 --> 00:07:58,141
those who graduated have graduated,

167
00:07:59,621 --> 00:08:00,782
and those who trained have started training.

168
00:08:01,982 --> 00:08:03,081
Everyone is rushing in different directions.

169
00:08:03,081 --> 00:08:04,702
All are striving forward for the best.

170
00:08:05,462 --> 00:08:06,702
But I'm different.

171
00:08:10,101 --> 00:08:11,222
I just want to

172
00:08:11,861 --> 00:08:13,061
go back to the past.

173
00:08:13,782 --> 00:08:14,901
I want to go back to high school.

174
00:08:16,301 --> 00:08:17,802
We enjoyed ourselves in the silverware store,

175
00:08:17,802 --> 00:08:19,301
talk about everything

176
00:08:20,621 --> 00:08:22,581
while having a hotpot.

177
00:08:23,901 --> 00:08:24,982
That was a wonderful memory.

178
00:08:25,742 --> 00:08:27,022
We were so happy back then.

179
00:08:31,262 --> 00:08:32,341
Now, everything has changed.

180
00:08:34,182 --> 00:08:37,621
- It has changed.
- Wang Yiyang? Wang Yiyang!

181
00:08:39,142 --> 00:08:40,202
Hey.

182
00:08:40,202 --> 00:08:41,661
Slow down. Don't move.

183
00:08:49,462 --> 00:08:51,381
<i>I didn't check my phone just now.
What happened?</i>

184
00:08:54,061 --> 00:08:55,242
The silverware store

185
00:08:55,242 --> 00:08:56,422
Is going to be demolished.

186
00:08:58,942 --> 00:09:00,682
<i>Wang Yiyang invited us to dinner</i>

187
00:09:00,682 --> 00:09:02,542
<i>to plan a reunion at the silverware store.</i>

188
00:09:03,141 --> 00:09:04,502
<i>But neither of you came.</i>

189
00:09:08,502 --> 00:09:10,542
Are you still eating now?
I'll come to find you.

190
00:09:10,542 --> 00:09:13,022
No need. I asked my brother to
send him back to the dorm.

191
00:09:14,182 --> 00:09:15,661
But…

192
00:09:15,661 --> 00:09:16,762
He drank too much,

193
00:09:16,762 --> 00:09:18,101
and he was in a very bad mood.

194
00:09:18,821 --> 00:09:20,201
He also said he wants to drop out.

195
00:09:20,201 --> 00:09:21,318
Drop out?

196
00:09:23,542 --> 00:09:25,841
Don't worry. How about this?
Tomorrow I'll find He Songnan,

197
00:09:25,841 --> 00:09:26,962
and we'll go talk to him together

198
00:09:26,962 --> 00:09:27,982
and see what's going on.

199
00:09:28,982 --> 00:09:29,990
Okay.

200
00:09:30,581 --> 00:09:31,901
- Bye.
- Bye.

201
00:09:56,182 --> 00:09:57,254
Still angry?

202
00:09:59,422 --> 00:10:00,621
Nope.

203
00:10:01,262 --> 00:10:02,822
You are both too busy.

204
00:10:02,822 --> 00:10:04,381
I don't dare to waste your time.

205
00:10:06,702 --> 00:10:07,861
And you're saying you're not angry.

206
00:10:08,381 --> 00:10:09,981
Last night, it was indeed our fault.

207
00:10:09,981 --> 00:10:11,341
We won't do it again.

208
00:10:11,341 --> 00:10:12,662
But what happened to you?

209
00:10:12,662 --> 00:10:14,181
Why are you making a fuss about dropping out?

210
00:10:14,181 --> 00:10:15,222
What do you mean making a fuss?

211
00:10:16,502 --> 00:10:17,502
This is called choosing.

212
00:10:22,381 --> 00:10:23,742
So what's the reason for your choice?

213
00:10:24,542 --> 00:10:25,902
There are only two months left
until graduation,

214
00:10:25,902 --> 00:10:27,902
If you have something on your mind,
just say it,

215
00:10:27,902 --> 00:10:28,942
We'll solve it together.

216
00:10:31,861 --> 00:10:32,901
I just figured out something.

217
00:10:33,661 --> 00:10:34,982
We worked so hard to get a diploma,

218
00:10:34,982 --> 00:10:36,902
but isn't it just for
finding a job in the future?

219
00:10:36,902 --> 00:10:38,581
I already have a job now.

220
00:10:38,581 --> 00:10:39,722
On the contrary, all those messy matters
about graduation are just a waste of time.

221
00:10:39,722 --> 00:10:41,502
How many fans can you gain in two months?

222
00:10:41,502 --> 00:10:43,241
You need to look at the long term.

223
00:10:43,241 --> 00:10:45,622
Getting a diploma is only beneficial for you.
There's no harm.

224
00:10:45,622 --> 00:10:47,842
Do you know how fierce
the competition is out there?

225
00:10:47,842 --> 00:10:49,382
How many people are striving hard

226
00:10:49,382 --> 00:10:51,062
yet are stuck because of their diplomas?

227
00:10:51,062 --> 00:10:52,422
Why don't you cherish it?

228
00:10:53,661 --> 00:10:54,821
How do you know I didn't cherish it?

229
00:10:56,182 --> 00:10:57,182
We're in different industries.

230
00:10:57,182 --> 00:10:59,022
So naturally,
our efforts are directed differently.

231
00:10:59,542 --> 00:11:00,882
You're just a farmer.

232
00:11:00,882 --> 00:11:02,282
Don't act as if you know everything.

233
00:11:02,282 --> 00:11:03,502
It's the same in every industry.

234
00:11:04,101 --> 00:11:05,581
Learning more won't do you any harm.

235
00:11:06,341 --> 00:11:07,742
I'll leave it at that.

236
00:11:07,742 --> 00:11:09,022
If you spend another two months on
waiting to get more followers,

237
00:11:09,101 --> 00:11:11,141
the little traffic you have
won't be enough to support you.

238
00:11:11,141 --> 00:11:13,521
Without your parents' financial support,
you'd be sleeping on the streets.

239
00:11:13,521 --> 00:11:14,521
What's it to you?

240
00:11:14,521 --> 00:11:15,700
Why do you care?

241
00:11:18,501 --> 00:11:19,509
Yeah.

242
00:11:20,021 --> 00:11:21,045
I know.

243
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:23,301
I used to fall short in all aspects
compared to you.

244
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:25,900
You guys looked down on me, didn't you?

245
00:11:26,781 --> 00:11:28,581
But that doesn't mean
it will be the same in the future.

246
00:11:31,021 --> 00:11:32,220
Just you wait and see.

247
00:11:33,101 --> 00:11:34,361
This account will definitely

248
00:11:34,361 --> 00:11:35,541
bring me great success.

249
00:11:35,541 --> 00:11:37,380
Then, you'll see.

250
00:11:43,061 --> 00:11:44,861
- Wait…
- Let him be.

251
00:11:47,021 --> 00:11:49,261
He's still fuming,

252
00:11:50,261 --> 00:11:51,621
He won't listen to anything you say.

253
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:55,040
Just let him

254
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,140
cool himself down.

255
00:12:01,341 --> 00:12:03,101
Come with me. I have something to tell you.

256
00:12:25,421 --> 00:12:27,121
He's now fully committed to that account.

257
00:12:27,801 --> 00:12:29,160
His final grades are a disaster.

258
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,561
If he wants to get his diploma now,
he'll have to delay graduation.

259
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,420
And the person he partnered with

260
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:34,541
was a villain.

261
00:12:34,541 --> 00:12:35,601
He took Wang Yiyang's creative ideas

262
00:12:35,601 --> 00:12:37,601
and signed a contract with
a multi-channel network company.

263
00:12:37,601 --> 00:12:38,661
Now,

264
00:12:38,661 --> 00:12:39,941
Wang Yiyang has lost

265
00:12:39,941 --> 00:12:40,960
both his studies and career.

266
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,580
It's our fault.

267
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:45,841
Why didn't any of us notice
his abnormal behavior earlier?

268
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,541
And now, he doesn't even come home on weekends.

269
00:12:48,541 --> 00:12:50,160
Other than managing his account,
he's just playing games.

270
00:12:51,041 --> 00:12:52,120
If this continues,

271
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:54,680
He doesn't even need to drop out.
The school will expel him.

272
00:12:55,881 --> 00:12:57,881
We really need to find a way to help him.

273
00:12:59,321 --> 00:13:01,081
Does he know about
the reunion at the silverware store?

274
00:13:01,841 --> 00:13:02,929
I told him.

275
00:13:03,533 --> 00:13:04,892
But,

276
00:13:04,892 --> 00:13:05,892
he didn't say anything.

277
00:13:06,773 --> 00:13:08,632
Is he not going to come? He's furious now.

278
00:13:08,632 --> 00:13:09,677
He will come.

279
00:13:10,533 --> 00:13:12,493
The silverware store is very important to him.

280
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:18,493
Let's first clear that day's schedule.

281
00:13:19,053 --> 00:13:20,272
If anything happens,

282
00:13:20,272 --> 00:13:21,372
we'll talk about it later.

283
00:13:46,132 --> 00:13:48,593
- I'll help you.
- No. I can handle it.

284
00:13:48,593 --> 00:13:49,773
You go move the stuff below.

285
00:13:49,773 --> 00:13:50,933
There's more below?

286
00:13:50,933 --> 00:13:52,132
Alright, I'll go.

287
00:13:58,253 --> 00:13:59,413
I thought there wasn't much stuff.

288
00:13:59,413 --> 00:14:00,853
I didn't expect it to be so tiring to move.

289
00:14:00,853 --> 00:14:02,073
Even if they raise the price next time,

290
00:14:02,073 --> 00:14:03,213
we shouldn't move these stuff ourselves.

291
00:14:05,533 --> 00:14:06,713
Don't spend money on these

292
00:14:06,713 --> 00:14:08,053
unnecessary matters.

293
00:14:08,053 --> 00:14:09,693
With this money, we can buy some

294
00:14:09,693 --> 00:14:11,052
daily necessities. Isn't that better?

295
00:14:11,773 --> 00:14:13,353
You might think I'm thin and fragile.

296
00:14:13,353 --> 00:14:14,473
I spent a lot of time

297
00:14:14,473 --> 00:14:16,453
working with my parents when I was little.

298
00:14:16,453 --> 00:14:18,253
I'm strong. Don't worry about me.

299
00:14:25,852 --> 00:14:26,869
Ruyi,

300
00:14:28,013 --> 00:14:29,193
I know you're capable,

301
00:14:29,193 --> 00:14:30,933
but I just don't want you to suffer.

302
00:14:32,493 --> 00:14:33,572
I also want to prove to you

303
00:14:34,253 --> 00:14:35,732
that I can provide a better life for you

304
00:14:35,732 --> 00:14:37,132
through my own efforts.

305
00:14:41,253 --> 00:14:42,493
I believe in you,

306
00:14:42,493 --> 00:14:43,673
but don't put too much

307
00:14:43,673 --> 00:14:45,052
pressure on yourself.

308
00:14:45,892 --> 00:14:47,712
Encountering difficulties in life

309
00:14:47,712 --> 00:14:49,173
Is normal.

310
00:14:50,052 --> 00:14:51,453
We're a couple.

311
00:14:52,013 --> 00:14:54,052
Overcoming difficulties together
is what we should do.

312
00:15:06,669 --> 00:15:07,850
I'll go answer a call.

313
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:08,889
You can tidy these things up.

314
00:15:08,889 --> 00:15:10,014
Alright.

315
00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:21,090
- Hello.
- <i>Where are you?</i>

316
00:15:21,090 --> 00:15:23,149
It's the weekend. I'm off.

317
00:15:23,830 --> 00:15:24,889
<i>Off?</i>

318
00:15:24,889 --> 00:15:26,750
<i>Your project report is just horrible.</i>

319
00:15:27,389 --> 00:15:29,030
<i>How did you calculate the material costs?</i>

320
00:15:29,709 --> 00:15:31,189
<i>How could you make such a basic mistake?</i>

321
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:34,290
I didn't calculate it directly.

322
00:15:34,290 --> 00:15:36,009
It was given to me
by the procurement department.

323
00:15:36,009 --> 00:15:38,109
I didn't even have access to that data.

324
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:41,510
<i>Xu Ruyi, you're just an intern.</i>

325
00:15:41,510 --> 00:15:43,630
<i>When encountering problems,
instead of striving for perfection,</i>

326
00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:45,189
<i>you've learned to shirk responsibility.</i>

327
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:47,270
<i>Is this your work attitude?</i>

328
00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:50,302
No.

329
00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:53,690
<i>No? Well, then.</i>

330
00:15:53,690 --> 00:15:54,949
<i>Come back to the company right now</i>

331
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:57,469
<i>and double-check all the data.</i>

332
00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:02,350
I understand.

333
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:15,390
There's something going on at my company.

334
00:16:15,390 --> 00:16:17,110
I need to go back.

335
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:18,670
I can't help you tidy up anymore.

336
00:16:19,469 --> 00:16:21,110
It's okay. I can handle it.

337
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:22,110
Let me walk you out.

338
00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:24,630
You don't have to. By the way,

339
00:16:26,869 --> 00:16:28,429
I wrote you a guide.

340
00:16:28,429 --> 00:16:30,750
It has all the good restaurants nearby,

341
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:32,110
and fruit shops and such.

342
00:16:33,469 --> 00:16:34,509
I'll be leaving then.

343
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:38,090
Okay. Go ahead.

344
00:16:38,090 --> 00:16:39,270
I can manage on my own.

345
00:17:38,029 --> 00:17:40,509
Mom, you're still awake?

346
00:17:42,429 --> 00:17:44,330
<i>Your dad and I had some free time today,</i>

347
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:45,870
<i>so we cleaned up</i>

348
00:17:45,870 --> 00:17:47,309
<i>your old room.</i>

349
00:17:47,309 --> 00:17:49,469
<i>We'd like to see if you like it.</i>

350
00:18:19,589 --> 00:18:22,069
<i>Ruyi, your dad and I</i>

351
00:18:22,069 --> 00:18:23,630
<i>hope that you can come back</i>

352
00:18:23,630 --> 00:18:24,870
<i>and find a job at home after graduation.</i>

353
00:18:25,870 --> 00:18:27,249
<i>Pucheng is nice,</i>

354
00:18:27,249 --> 00:18:28,949
<i>but if you want to stand on your own feet,</i>

355
00:18:28,949 --> 00:18:30,230
<i>you have to fight for it.</i>

356
00:18:30,909 --> 00:18:32,670
<i>I don't want you to work so hard.</i>

357
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:35,510
<i>If you can't stand it anymore,</i>

358
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:36,989
<i>just come home.</i>

359
00:18:38,029 --> 00:18:40,329
<i>I'll always be here,</i>

360
00:18:40,329 --> 00:18:42,109
<i>and nobody will dare to bully you.</i>

361
00:18:46,688 --> 00:18:50,502
<i>[Demolition]</i>

362
00:19:48,670 --> 00:19:50,150
It seems

363
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:51,350
there's a lot of preparation to do

364
00:19:52,629 --> 00:19:54,150
before we can have this meal.

365
00:20:26,989 --> 00:20:28,390
Don't worry.

366
00:20:28,390 --> 00:20:30,029
Wang Yiyang may seem indifferent,

367
00:20:30,629 --> 00:20:31,710
but he's a sentimental guy.

368
00:20:34,221 --> 00:20:36,302
I believe he will definitely come.

369
00:21:04,462 --> 00:21:05,701
You haven't left school yet.

370
00:21:05,701 --> 00:21:07,462
You have no idea how hard it is
to be independent.

371
00:21:08,822 --> 00:21:09,902
How hard can it be?

372
00:21:11,422 --> 00:21:12,902
No matter how hard, it's still freedom.

373
00:21:13,782 --> 00:21:15,181
I can do whatever I want.

374
00:21:16,181 --> 00:21:17,581
Well, you haven't experienced

375
00:21:17,581 --> 00:21:18,942
roommates throwing parties
in the middle of the night,

376
00:21:18,942 --> 00:21:20,282
or old ladies doing square dances
in the early morning.

377
00:21:20,282 --> 00:21:22,221
You're lucky if you can sleep
three hours a day.

378
00:21:23,862 --> 00:21:25,202
But you made it through, didn't you?

379
00:21:25,202 --> 00:21:27,222
What do you mean, made it through?
I was either late every day

380
00:21:27,222 --> 00:21:28,742
or messed up the experiment.

381
00:21:28,742 --> 00:21:30,661
If it weren't for Ruyi finding me a

382
00:21:30,661 --> 00:21:32,101
cheap and reliable new apartment,

383
00:21:33,141 --> 00:21:35,101
I might have been kicked out of the lab by now.

384
00:21:36,541 --> 00:21:38,701
I can vouch for him on this.

385
00:21:39,382 --> 00:21:41,382
He was in a really bad mood during that time.

386
00:21:41,382 --> 00:21:43,342
Did you hear that? Juan will never lie to you.

387
00:21:44,862 --> 00:21:46,601
Sometimes in life,

388
00:21:46,601 --> 00:21:47,782
you really can't be too confident.

389
00:21:48,502 --> 00:21:49,822
I'm a living example.

390
00:21:49,822 --> 00:21:51,181
Alright, alright.

391
00:21:53,782 --> 00:21:54,862
No matter what,

392
00:21:55,581 --> 00:21:56,741
you all have your diplomas.

393
00:21:57,342 --> 00:21:59,882
What about me? I spent four years in college,

394
00:21:59,882 --> 00:22:00,982
and what did I get out of it?

395
00:22:02,422 --> 00:22:03,701
I don't even have a diploma.

396
00:22:04,862 --> 00:22:06,062
I thought about starting a business,

397
00:22:06,062 --> 00:22:07,482
but I chose the wrong partner.

398
00:22:07,482 --> 00:22:08,502
I was fooled by someone.

399
00:22:10,221 --> 00:22:11,701
I was kicked out by my dad.

400
00:22:12,342 --> 00:22:13,741
I was kicked out by my school.

401
00:22:14,302 --> 00:22:15,862
And I was also kicked out by my fans.

402
00:22:16,502 --> 00:22:19,502
Impressive, right?
That can be called a hat trick.

403
00:22:23,061 --> 00:22:24,141
I'm in such a miserable state.

404
00:22:24,141 --> 00:22:25,942
How can you still laugh?

405
00:22:39,302 --> 00:22:40,342
Do you remember

406
00:22:40,862 --> 00:22:42,122
when we were in high school,

407
00:22:42,122 --> 00:22:43,502
we once had a hard time

408
00:22:43,502 --> 00:22:44,841
at this very store?

409
00:22:44,841 --> 00:22:46,102
Sure.

410
00:22:46,102 --> 00:22:47,822
There was a punk who came to cause trouble.

411
00:22:47,822 --> 00:22:49,101
I punched him and sent him flying.

412
00:22:53,197 --> 00:22:54,757
Juan sent him flying.
What does it have to do with you?

413
00:22:55,557 --> 00:22:57,478
I helped too, okay?

414
00:22:57,478 --> 00:22:59,918
Don't you remember? I took that big flip flop

415
00:22:59,918 --> 00:23:01,318
and…

416
00:23:01,318 --> 00:23:02,798
And I whacked him on the back.

417
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:05,278
Also, when we couldn't afford the rent,

418
00:23:05,278 --> 00:23:06,878
we were almost kicked out by the agency.

419
00:23:06,878 --> 00:23:08,097
We started a

420
00:23:08,097 --> 00:23:09,238
silver jewelry DIY,

421
00:23:09,238 --> 00:23:10,358
and it brought us back to life.

422
00:23:11,518 --> 00:23:12,614
<i>Let's do it.</i>

423
00:23:15,518 --> 00:23:17,677
Back then, our life was really tough,

424
00:23:18,518 --> 00:23:19,778
but after overcoming it,

425
00:23:19,778 --> 00:23:21,278
we were truly delighted.

426
00:23:23,557 --> 00:23:24,557
But

427
00:23:25,557 --> 00:23:26,694
that's what dreams are like.

428
00:23:27,998 --> 00:23:29,077
Your path will be covered by traps

429
00:23:30,438 --> 00:23:31,438
and there will be more challenges.

430
00:23:32,478 --> 00:23:33,757
You'll only feel a sense of accomplishment

431
00:23:34,757 --> 00:23:35,757
after overcoming all of them.

432
00:23:37,918 --> 00:23:39,598
If you could achieve something that easily,

433
00:23:39,598 --> 00:23:40,757
it wouldn't be a dream,

434
00:23:41,318 --> 00:23:42,342
wouldn't it?

<i>♫ I want to become better with you ♫</i>

436
00:23:47,658 --> 00:23:48,658
Exactly.

437
00:23:49,178 --> 00:23:50,217
Without difficulties,

438
00:23:50,217 --> 00:23:51,478
it would be so boring.

439
00:23:51,478 --> 00:23:52,497
Right?

440
00:23:52,497 --> 00:23:53,978
I'm a tough man.

441
00:23:53,978 --> 00:23:55,917
I have to choose this path for myself,

442
00:23:55,917 --> 00:23:57,577
and I'll never give up
even when there's no way out.

443
00:23:58,377 --> 00:23:59,410
That's right!

444
00:23:59,937 --> 00:24:01,098
We're still young.

445
00:24:01,098 --> 00:24:02,377
We have time and energy.

446
00:24:03,138 --> 00:24:04,146
What's there to fear?

447
00:24:04,738 --> 00:24:06,118
How does that song go again?

448
00:24:06,118 --> 00:24:07,658
That one!

I had you fix my bracelet.

458
00:24:56,158 --> 00:24:57,638
Feels like it just happened.

459
00:24:58,679 --> 00:25:00,479
But that was a long time ago.

460
00:25:01,759 --> 00:25:03,278
Well,

461
00:25:03,278 --> 00:25:04,438
No discord,

462
00:25:05,358 --> 00:25:06,358
no concord.

463
00:25:08,879 --> 00:25:09,983
Sure.

464
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:12,079
What shocked me the most

465
00:25:12,079 --> 00:25:13,759
was seeing you in the class.

466
00:25:14,319 --> 00:25:16,038
I was stunned.

467
00:25:16,038 --> 00:25:17,959
A shop owner

468
00:25:17,959 --> 00:25:19,879
suddenly became a student

469
00:25:19,879 --> 00:25:21,438
who could say hello to the teacher.

470
00:25:25,878 --> 00:25:27,019
What about you?

471
00:25:27,019 --> 00:25:28,539
What was your first impression

472
00:25:28,539 --> 00:25:29,959
of me?

473
00:25:32,519 --> 00:25:33,799
I thought

474
00:25:37,359 --> 00:25:39,119
you were like a wounded little animal.

475
00:25:41,878 --> 00:25:42,975
Like a little cat

476
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:45,119
that just left home.

477
00:25:45,959 --> 00:25:47,007
A well-behaved

478
00:25:48,478 --> 00:25:49,959
but confused cat.

479
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:54,399
You were

480
00:25:54,399 --> 00:25:56,438
kind of depressed

481
00:25:57,399 --> 00:25:58,639
but very strong.

482
00:26:04,598 --> 00:26:06,598
So many stories have happened here.

483
00:26:08,558 --> 00:26:10,199
This place is going to be demolished soon.

484
00:26:11,199 --> 00:26:12,558
I'm quite sad to see that.

485
00:26:16,679 --> 00:26:17,718
Me too.

486
00:26:19,359 --> 00:26:20,919
This place is like home

487
00:26:21,718 --> 00:26:22,919
to me.

488
00:26:24,919 --> 00:26:25,979
In the past,

489
00:26:25,979 --> 00:26:27,478
no matter what happened,

490
00:26:29,158 --> 00:26:30,399
as long as I came back here,

491
00:26:31,878 --> 00:26:33,278
I would feel safe.

492
00:26:43,079 --> 00:26:44,127
But now,

493
00:26:45,799 --> 00:26:47,558
it has completed its mission.

494
00:26:50,318 --> 00:26:51,359
I think

495
00:26:53,598 --> 00:26:55,079
this must be its best ending.

496
00:27:24,679 --> 00:27:25,938
Have you checked everything?

497
00:27:25,938 --> 00:27:27,239
Don't leave anything.

498
00:27:33,598 --> 00:27:34,959
It's done.

499
00:27:34,959 --> 00:27:36,718
Thank you.

500
00:27:38,319 --> 00:27:40,959
I really don't want to leave you guys.

501
00:27:41,559 --> 00:27:42,879
Why so sudden?

502
00:27:43,519 --> 00:27:44,639
I have to.

503
00:27:44,639 --> 00:27:45,839
Our newspaper

504
00:27:45,839 --> 00:27:46,979
took on a big event.

505
00:27:46,979 --> 00:27:48,259
We're short-staffed.

506
00:27:48,259 --> 00:27:50,439
The supervisor asked us new recruits

507
00:27:50,439 --> 00:27:51,798
to start work early.

508
00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:53,639
Take care of yourself.

509
00:27:59,038 --> 00:28:00,519
When I get my salary,

510
00:28:00,519 --> 00:28:01,759
I'll treat you guys to a meal.

511
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:05,631
I'm leaving.

512
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:07,439
We'll walk you out.

513
00:28:20,478 --> 00:28:22,279
That's all for today's lecture.

514
00:28:22,279 --> 00:28:23,639
Thank you all for listening.

515
00:28:30,999 --> 00:28:32,031
Shen Juan.

516
00:28:33,278 --> 00:28:34,678
Hi.

517
00:28:34,678 --> 00:28:35,899
I was just about to find Lin Yujing.

518
00:28:35,899 --> 00:28:36,919
Since I ran into you,

519
00:28:36,919 --> 00:28:38,158
I'll just ask you directly.

520
00:28:40,079 --> 00:28:41,119
Look at this.

521
00:28:41,959 --> 00:28:44,658
Our company is doing a craftsman exhibition.

522
00:28:44,658 --> 00:28:46,279
We want to borrow silver ornaments
from your uncle

523
00:28:46,279 --> 00:28:47,559
for the exhibit. Is that okay?

524
00:28:48,439 --> 00:28:49,439
Of course.

525
00:28:51,839 --> 00:28:52,959
How about this?

526
00:28:53,559 --> 00:28:55,439
You send me the specific requirements,

527
00:28:55,439 --> 00:28:56,699
and I'll find some for you.

528
00:28:56,699 --> 00:28:58,975
- That's great, I'll send it to you now.
- Okay.

529
00:29:00,038 --> 00:29:01,559
I've been busy with the exhibition recently

530
00:29:01,559 --> 00:29:03,159
and haven't been in touch with Lin Yujing.

531
00:29:03,159 --> 00:29:04,358
How has she been?

532
00:29:04,358 --> 00:29:05,407
She's doing well.

533
00:29:06,639 --> 00:29:09,198
I heard she was hired
by Professor Hu Zhongquan's team.

534
00:29:09,198 --> 00:29:11,059
She's about to work
at the headquarters in Huaicheng.

535
00:29:11,059 --> 00:29:12,718
I haven't congratulated her yet.

536
00:29:17,798 --> 00:29:20,199
She hasn't told you yet, has she?

537
00:29:30,238 --> 00:29:31,559
Why are you here?

538
00:29:32,639 --> 00:29:34,319
I was just passing by.

539
00:29:34,839 --> 00:29:36,219
We just saw each other yesterday.

540
00:29:36,219 --> 00:29:37,278
And you miss me already today?

541
00:29:39,199 --> 00:29:40,699
I'm about to move

542
00:29:40,699 --> 00:29:41,839
to the provincial team's dormitory?

543
00:29:42,759 --> 00:29:43,999
Do you want to visit it?

544
00:29:43,999 --> 00:29:44,999
Sure.

545
00:29:56,759 --> 00:29:57,839
What's wrong with you?

546
00:29:57,839 --> 00:29:59,399
Why do you seem strange today?

547
00:30:01,798 --> 00:30:02,815
Nothing.

548
00:30:04,079 --> 00:30:05,199
I just want to hug you.

549
00:30:26,519 --> 00:30:27,719
This place is pretty good

550
00:30:27,719 --> 00:30:28,859
and clean.

551
00:30:28,859 --> 00:30:29,959
Of course.

552
00:30:30,478 --> 00:30:31,999
I cleaned it in advance.

553
00:30:33,079 --> 00:30:34,143
Where is Orange?

554
00:30:34,879 --> 00:30:36,499
Well,

555
00:30:36,499 --> 00:30:37,579
after settling down,

556
00:30:37,579 --> 00:30:38,598
I'll bring Orange here.

557
00:30:40,759 --> 00:30:42,999
I feel like something is missing.

558
00:30:43,999 --> 00:30:45,023
What's missing?

559
00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:55,639
Much better now.

560
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:12,519
Comfortable.

561
00:31:43,678 --> 00:31:44,767
Are you hungry?

562
00:32:08,279 --> 00:32:09,311
What do I look like?

563
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:13,118
Ultraman.

564
00:32:13,998 --> 00:32:14,998
Onion man.

565
00:32:19,718 --> 00:32:21,099
<i>The contract has been sent to your email.</i>

566
00:32:21,099 --> 00:32:22,379
<i>Please check it.</i>

567
00:32:22,379 --> 00:32:24,239
<i>The onboarding date has been confirmed.</i>

568
00:32:24,239 --> 00:32:25,398
<i>Please reply as soon as possible.</i>

569
00:32:36,439 --> 00:32:37,535
Okay.

570
00:32:38,358 --> 00:32:39,359
Take a look.

571
00:32:40,679 --> 00:32:41,695
Not bad.

572
00:32:42,758 --> 00:32:43,807
Give it a try.

573
00:32:51,358 --> 00:32:52,415
How is it?

574
00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:55,058
It's good,

575
00:32:55,058 --> 00:32:56,319
but it's a bit sweet.

576
00:32:56,998 --> 00:32:58,047
Is it?

577
00:33:20,518 --> 00:33:21,959
It does taste a bit sweet.

578
00:33:24,439 --> 00:33:25,535
I'll redo it.

579
00:33:38,398 --> 00:33:40,919
- Finished?
- Try again.

580
00:33:48,959 --> 00:33:50,015
How is it?

581
00:33:52,358 --> 00:33:53,439
Delicious.

582
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:55,439
You're good at cooking.

583
00:34:06,638 --> 00:34:08,179
<i>I heard she was hired</i>

584
00:34:08,179 --> 00:34:09,199
<i>by Professor Hu Zhongquan.</i>

585
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:10,999
<i>She's about to work
at the headquarters in Huaicheng.</i>

586
00:34:10,999 --> 00:34:12,638
<i>I haven't congratulated her yet.</i>

587
00:34:16,559 --> 00:34:18,799
<i>She hasn't told you yet, has she?</i>

588
00:34:21,118 --> 00:34:22,498
<i>Please don't tell her</i>

589
00:34:22,498 --> 00:34:23,559
<i>that I know about this.</i>

590
00:34:29,398 --> 00:34:30,439
Have a try.

591
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:35,079
Isn't it good?

592
00:34:35,598 --> 00:34:37,319
- Delicious.
- Eat more.

593
00:34:57,799 --> 00:34:59,199
Do you remember

594
00:34:59,199 --> 00:35:00,929
when we shot balloons at the amusement park?

595
00:35:00,929 --> 00:35:04,079
Yeah. I also remember the teddy bear
and Peter Rabbit.

596
00:35:04,758 --> 00:35:05,823
Let's have another match.

597
00:35:07,199 --> 00:35:08,223
Okay.

598
00:35:09,638 --> 00:35:11,398
Sir, I'll do five shots.

599
00:35:28,319 --> 00:35:29,419
So many years have passed,

600
00:35:29,419 --> 00:35:31,159
but your skills haven't improved at all.

601
00:35:31,718 --> 00:35:33,139
I gave all my luck to you.

602
00:35:33,139 --> 00:35:34,279
It's normal that I can't hit it.

603
00:35:37,878 --> 00:35:40,199
Okay, I'll give you some luck too.

604
00:35:43,839 --> 00:35:44,863
Hold it.

605
00:35:53,439 --> 00:35:54,739
I aim,

606
00:35:54,739 --> 00:35:55,959
and you pull the trigger.

607
00:36:18,799 --> 00:36:20,118
Young man, what do you do?

608
00:36:22,199 --> 00:36:23,399
I'm just

609
00:36:23,399 --> 00:36:24,638
a college student.

610
00:36:36,439 --> 00:36:38,039
Sir, we don't need the prize.

611
00:36:38,039 --> 00:36:39,758
Thanks. Let's go.

612
00:36:40,518 --> 00:36:41,535
Let's go.

613
00:36:49,718 --> 00:36:52,159
I had a great time today.

614
00:37:00,358 --> 00:37:01,375
Well,

615
00:37:02,319 --> 00:37:03,327
have an early night.

616
00:37:07,159 --> 00:37:08,638
Well,

617
00:37:08,638 --> 00:37:10,618
if you move to the provincial team dormitory,

618
00:37:10,618 --> 00:37:12,718
does that mean
you're going to start formal training?

619
00:37:13,758 --> 00:37:15,539
What about our graduation ceremony?

620
00:37:15,539 --> 00:37:16,598
Don't worry.

621
00:37:17,319 --> 00:37:18,518
I've already talked to the team.

622
00:37:19,199 --> 00:37:20,559
I will be back

623
00:37:21,079 --> 00:37:22,478
for the graduation ceremony.

624
00:37:23,679 --> 00:37:24,879
It's a deal.

625
00:37:24,879 --> 00:37:26,219
See you then.

626
00:37:26,219 --> 00:37:27,391
Okay.

627
00:37:44,839 --> 00:37:45,887
What's wrong?

628
00:37:47,079 --> 00:37:48,159
Can't bear to part with me?

629
00:37:55,998 --> 00:37:57,079
I can't.

630
00:38:18,279 --> 00:38:19,799
<i>Does the graduation start at ten today?</i>

631
00:38:20,319 --> 00:38:21,478
<i>At nine.</i>

632
00:38:23,718 --> 00:38:25,799
<i>Hurry up.
Ruyi and I will wait for you at the station.</i>

633
00:38:29,638 --> 00:38:31,319
Three, two, one.

634
00:38:33,799 --> 00:38:35,039
You two look at each other.

635
00:38:37,279 --> 00:38:38,418
Good.

636
00:38:38,418 --> 00:38:40,318
Get a little closer, more intimate.

637
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:41,719
Take some funny ones.

638
00:38:41,719 --> 00:38:43,558
Yes, that's it.

639
00:38:43,558 --> 00:38:45,279
Let's do a three-shot.

640
00:38:45,279 --> 00:38:47,159
Shen Juan, you carry Lin Yujing.

641
00:38:48,878 --> 00:38:50,718
Yes, that's it. Looks good.

642
00:38:56,199 --> 00:38:57,478
Put me down.

643
00:38:57,998 --> 00:38:59,079
Shen Juan.

644
00:39:03,638 --> 00:39:05,479
Stop it.

645
00:39:05,479 --> 00:39:07,559
- Stop.
- Are we going on?

646
00:39:09,118 --> 00:39:10,143
Gu Xia, come here.

647
00:39:26,638 --> 00:39:28,359
You started shooting without me?

648
00:39:28,359 --> 00:39:30,099
What about us?

649
00:39:30,099 --> 00:39:31,919
Wang Yiyang,
where did you get the bachelor's gown?

650
00:39:32,518 --> 00:39:34,538
I borrow it.

651
00:39:34,538 --> 00:39:36,419
It's for the graduation photo.

652
00:39:36,419 --> 00:39:37,878
Do I look good?

653
00:39:39,839 --> 00:39:41,479
- Not bad.
- Come on.

654
00:39:41,479 --> 00:39:42,479
Take one for us three brothers.

655
00:39:42,479 --> 00:39:43,479
Lin Yujing, hurry up.

656
00:39:43,479 --> 00:39:45,239
- Let's go.
- You held the wrong person.

657
00:39:45,239 --> 00:39:46,559
You use this to shoot them.

658
00:39:53,518 --> 00:39:56,079
It's so good.
We should have taken it in high school.

659
00:39:56,079 --> 00:39:57,439
It's a pity you weren't there then.

660
00:39:58,559 --> 00:40:00,358
It's okay. It's not too late to do it now.

661
00:40:02,358 --> 00:40:03,779
Take one for the three of us.

662
00:40:03,779 --> 00:40:05,039
Come on.

663
00:40:05,039 --> 00:40:06,039
Come on.

664
00:40:08,358 --> 00:40:10,118
Three, two, one.

665
00:40:29,638 --> 00:40:30,655
Are you happy?

666
00:40:31,878 --> 00:40:32,938
Juan, hurry up.

667
00:40:32,938 --> 00:40:34,079
- You're dawdling.
- Isn't it strange

668
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:35,179
if I stand here?

669
00:40:35,179 --> 00:40:36,319
Yes, it is.

670
00:40:36,319 --> 00:40:37,639
Move.

671
00:40:37,639 --> 00:40:38,719
Just stand there.

672
00:40:40,638 --> 00:40:42,279
- You stand there.
- You're over there.

673
00:40:43,958 --> 00:40:46,519
We graduated.

674
00:40:57,485 --> 00:40:58,984
<i>In the daylight,</i>

675
00:40:58,984 --> 00:41:01,564
<i>I am imprisoned in a dark dream.</i>

676
00:41:02,244 --> 00:41:03,485
<i>The clouds cover the sun</i>

677
00:41:03,485 --> 00:41:04,765
<i>and nothing can grow.</i>

678
00:41:04,765 --> 00:41:06,005
<i>Everything is bleak.</i>

679
00:41:07,525 --> 00:41:09,384
<i>When you walked through the wilderness,</i>

680
00:41:09,384 --> 00:41:11,325
<i>you held my hand and told me</i>

681
00:41:12,204 --> 00:41:13,685
<i>there was always a light</i>

682
00:41:13,685 --> 00:41:14,885
<i>in front.</i>

683
00:41:18,885 --> 00:41:20,644
<i>No one will always be favored by the light.</i>

684
00:41:22,005 --> 00:41:24,124
<i>We must learn to walk out of the darkness</i>

685
00:41:24,805 --> 00:41:26,285
<i>and actively seek the light.</i>

686
00:41:28,244 --> 00:41:29,844
<i>You and I</i>

687
00:41:29,844 --> 00:41:31,244
<i>are each other's light.</i>

688
00:41:46,047 --> 00:41:50,591
<i>♫ Love sprouts in my palm ♫</i>

689
00:41:51,903 --> 00:41:55,743
<i>♫ Yet worried linger within my eyes ♫</i>

690
00:41:57,535 --> 00:42:02,111
<i>♫ Our story hasn't ended ♫</i>

691
00:42:03,039 --> 00:42:06,719
<i>♫ So where are we now ♫</i>

692
00:42:08,543 --> 00:42:14,207
<i>♫ I want to hug you so badly ♫</i>

693
00:42:14,207 --> 00:42:18,271
<i>♫ I want to become better with you ♫</i>

694
00:42:19,519 --> 00:42:24,383
<i>♫ The youth we shared ♫</i>

695
00:42:24,383 --> 00:42:30,431
<i>♫ Turned into a rainbow within my heart ♫</i>

696
00:42:30,943 --> 00:42:36,511
<i>♫ I really want to warm you ♫</i>

697
00:42:36,511 --> 00:42:38,399
<i>♫ I want to share with you ♫</i>

698
00:42:38,399 --> 00:42:43,071
<i>♫ The beauty of the world ♫</i>

699
00:42:43,955 --> 00:42:46,175
<i>♫ We promised ♫</i>

700
00:42:46,751 --> 00:42:52,447
<i>♫ To never be apart ♫</i>

701
00:42:53,183 --> 00:42:58,885
<i>♫ Do you want to hear me sing ♫</i>

702
00:42:58,885 --> 00:43:03,647
<i>♫ The wind chime swaying in my heart ♫</i>

703
00:43:04,191 --> 00:43:08,415
<i>♫ Is a wish ♫</i>

704
00:43:09,151 --> 00:43:15,039
<i>♫ I secretly made for you ♫</i>

705
00:43:15,583 --> 00:43:21,119
<i>♫ I want to plant ♫</i>

706
00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:23,007
<i>♫ A red maple forest ♫</i>

707
00:43:23,007 --> 00:43:27,615
<i>♫ To dye the whole mountain red ♫</i>

708
00:43:28,543 --> 00:43:30,783
<i>♫ The sky after the rain ♫</i>

709
00:43:31,423 --> 00:43:36,351
<i>♫ Was painted by our brilliant dreams ♫</i>

710
00:43:43,231 --> 00:43:47,999
<i>♫ Time is a flower of dream ♫</i>

711
00:43:48,831 --> 00:43:53,917
<i>♫ You've already collected it ♫</i>

712
00:43:54,847 --> 00:43:58,847
<i>♫ When we all become better ♫</i>

713
00:44:00,319 --> 00:44:04,447
<i>♫ We'll see the best of the world together ♫</i>
