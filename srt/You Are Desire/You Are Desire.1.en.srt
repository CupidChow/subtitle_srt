 I can't even hang out with my classmates.

I just can't get her. School is about to start!

28
00:02:09,326 --> 00:02:13,046
Yujing, since I divorced your mother,

29
00:02:13,046 --> 00:02:15,206
we haven't seen each other for more than two years.

30
00:02:15,206 --> 00:02:18,706
What did your mom tell you before you came to Pucheng?

31
00:02:18,706 --> 00:02:20,447
She asked me to spend a few days here.

32
00:02:20,447 --> 00:02:22,426
You know, get to know your new family.

33
00:02:22,426 --> 00:02:26,147
I've never met them since you remarried.

34
00:02:28,487 --> 00:02:30,987
Your Aunt Guan and her family are kind.

35
00:02:30,987 --> 00:02:32,847
But still, I have to remind you,

36
00:02:32,847 --> 00:02:34,806
you can't be as willful as when you're with your mother.

37
00:02:34,806 --> 00:02:36,907
Keep yourself under control.

38
00:02:36,907 --> 00:02:39,247
You'd better choose your words wisely.

39
00:02:39,247 --> 00:02:43,006
Be more thoughtful and obedient.

40
00:02:43,006 --> 00:02:46,706
Don't cause me trouble. Okay? I don't have much patience for you.

41
00:02:49,326 --> 00:02:52,907
Listen to me! I'm talking to you!

42
00:03:02,687 --> 00:03:04,987
Aunt Guan is your elder.

43
00:03:04,987 --> 00:03:08,227
You should show respect when you meet her.

44
00:03:08,227 --> 00:03:11,947
You'd better leave her a good impression.

45
00:03:11,947 --> 00:03:13,987
Don't be like your mom.

46
00:03:13,987 --> 00:03:16,326
She puts up a long face at everyone.

We have two things to celebrate today.

53
00:05:15,447 --> 00:05:19,347
First, Mingxiu passed his internship.

54
00:05:19,347 --> 00:05:22,286
Second, your new book is going to be published.

55
00:05:22,286 --> 00:05:25,007
No, no. It's far from being published.

56
00:05:25,007 --> 00:05:27,766
I've just finished writing it. It's not a big deal.

57
00:05:27,766 --> 00:05:29,646
How come? Your book is awesome.

58
00:05:29,646 --> 00:05:32,626
I'm sure someone will recognize your talent.

59
00:05:32,626 --> 00:05:35,047
When it's published, I'll pre-order a hundred copies.

60
00:05:35,047 --> 00:05:37,966
You can sign them, and I'll gift them to my friends.

61
00:05:37,966 --> 00:05:39,807
It'll also be a sort of promotion.

62
00:05:39,807 --> 00:05:42,247
No, that's not necessary.

63
00:05:42,247 --> 00:05:43,726
Congratulations, Dad.

64
00:05:43,726 --> 00:05:47,907
At least someone is willing to buy your book when it comes out.

65
00:05:49,966 --> 00:05:52,807
Hey, don't underestimate my book.

66
00:05:52,807 --> 00:05:54,766
Once it's published, it will be a huge hit.

67
00:05:54,766 --> 00:05:57,807
I might even sell a million copies.

68
00:06:01,007 --> 00:06:03,467
Why aren't you eating?

69
00:06:03,467 --> 00:06:06,047
Here, try this.

70
00:06:10,406 --> 00:06:13,007
You really know how to choose dishes.

71
00:06:13,007 --> 00:06:16,607
Shrimp has always been Yujing's favorite.

72
00:06:17,406 --> 00:06:18,646
A gourmand once said,

73
00:06:18,646 --> 00:06:22,227
"Only the Drunken Shrimp is worth a try."

74
00:06:22,726 --> 00:06:25,787
Yujing, today is your lucky day.

75
00:06:25,787 --> 00:06:27,986
Hurry up and try this shrimp.

76
00:06:29,807 --> 00:06:33,507
What are you looking at? Hurry up and eat.

77
00:06:33,507 --> 00:06:37,807
But, Dad, I don't eat shrimp. Don't you remember?

78
00:06:39,526 --> 00:06:41,047
Aunt Guan is so nice to you.

79
00:06:41,047 --> 00:06:43,406
She invited you to come over.

80
00:06:43,406 --> 00:06:47,086
And she even prepared such a feast for you.

81
00:06:49,866 --> 00:06:50,987
Come on, just eat it.

82
00:06:50,987 --> 00:06:56,447
Dad, I've been allergic to shrimp since I was little. Don't you remember?

83
00:06:56,447 --> 00:06:57,846
It's due to my negligence.

84
00:06:57,846 --> 00:07:01,807
I prepared this without asking what she likes.

85
00:07:01,807 --> 00:07:04,326
But in Pucheng, we prefer bland food.

86
00:07:04,326 --> 00:07:07,127
You'll have to get used to it in the future.

87
00:07:07,127 --> 00:07:09,807
No need, Auntie. That's not necessary.

88
00:07:09,807 --> 00:07:11,866

00:07:22,887 --> 00:07:26,326
Xiangmei, don't mind her.

91
00:07:26,326 --> 00:07:29,347
She used to be a sweet girl.

92
00:07:29,347 --> 00:07:33,347
But she's been with her mother for too long and got spoiled.

93
00:07:35,267 --> 00:07:39,126

00:13:28,926 --> 00:13:30,707
It's not that serious.

00:17:50,506 --> 00:17:52,747
His height is his only advantage.

177
00:18:00,327 --> 00:18:04,287
Don't touch that!

178
00:18:19,847 --> 00:18:22,567
How could you tamper with other people's stuff?

179
00:18:22,567 --> 00:18:26,246
Luckily, I stopped you in time, or you'd be in trouble.

180
00:18:30,966 --> 00:18:32,527
You did it on purpose, didn't you?

181
00:18:32,527 --> 00:18:33,646
What do you mean?

182
00:18:33,646 --> 00:18:35,887
It was just a broken clasp, but now it's torn in half.

183
00:18:35,887 --> 00:18:37,707
How could you possibly have customers?

184
00:18:37,707 --> 00:18:40,006
Watch it!

185
00:18:40,006 --> 00:18:42,866
How would it be broken if you hadn't touched that pen?

186
00:18:42,866 --> 00:18:44,286
What's wrong?

187
00:18:47,047 --> 00:18:49,066
What happened to this bracelet?

188
00:18:49,767 --> 00:18:52,406
Hey, calm down. How about this?

189
00:18:52,406 --> 00:18:55,567
Since the bracelet is broken, why not make two bracelets instead?

190
00:18:55,567 --> 00:18:57,527
I'll thread the other half with a red string.

191
00:18:57,527 --> 00:18:59,847
That design looks great. We normally charge several hundred for each.

192
00:18:59,847 --> 00:19:02,306
But you only need to pay the processing fee.

193
00:19:02,306 --> 00:19:04,767
Are you saying that I need to pay you after you broke my stuff?

194
00:19:04,767 --> 00:19:06,006
This is a scam, right?

195
00:19:06,006 --> 00:19:08,346
- Of course not! 
 - Scam? Seriously?

196
00:19:08,346 --> 00:19:10,726
Since it's broken, I'll fix it for you.

197
00:19:16,247 --> 00:19:18,227
How are you planning to fix it?

198
00:19:19,406 --> 00:19:22,127
This bracelet is a bit complicated.

199
00:19:22,127 --> 00:19:24,047
If you want it to look exactly like before,

200
00:19:24,047 --> 00:19:26,927
I'm probably your best choice.

201
00:19:29,707 --> 00:19:33,646
<i>Where's the car I parked at the entrance? Where the hell is it?</i>

202
00:19:41,646 --> 00:19:45,287
The car I parked at the entrance, why isn't it there anymore?

203
00:19:45,287 --> 00:19:46,847
It had been parked over there for a long time, but nobody came to claim it.

204
00:19:46,847 --> 00:19:48,367
And there was even a dog peeing there.

205
00:19:48,367 --> 00:19:50,407
So we called the police to tow it away.

206
00:19:51,767 --> 00:19:54,106
Good for you to admit it.

207
00:19:54,106 --> 00:19:56,327
Now, let's talk about the compensation.

208
00:19:56,327 --> 00:20:00,467
Sure, but she's not involved. Let her go.

209
00:20:00,467 --> 00:20:02,926
All right, go ahead.

210
00:20:07,246 --> 00:20:09,847
We should have made things easier long ago.

211
00:20:09,847 --> 00:20:13,546
Now, let's talk about compensation. Okay?

212
00:20:14,446 --> 00:20:18,927
The lotus and orchids in my yard, you've all smashed them.

213
00:20:19,446 --> 00:20:22,047
You surely have to compensate us. How would you like to pay?

214
00:20:22,047 --> 00:20:24,527
Juan is right. Since you guys want to compensate,

215
00:20:24,527 --> 00:20:26,726
we will accept it.

216
00:20:28,066 --> 00:20:29,716
How dare you!

217
00:20:34,006 --> 00:20:36,486
Well, I think your work time is over. Give me back my bracelet.

218
00:20:36,486 --> 00:20:39,127
No, wait. Just trust us once. Okay?

219
00:20:39,127 --> 00:20:40,327
I guarantee that I will fix it for you.

220
00:20:40,327 --> 00:20:43,527
But you have to wait for us for a moment. Okay? We need to handle these matters first.

221
00:20:43,527 --> 00:20:45,206
Wait here for a moment.

222
00:20:45,206 --> 00:20:46,607
After I finish dealing with them,

223
00:20:46,607 --> 00:20:49,346
I'll immediately come back to fix it for you.

224
00:20:49,346 --> 00:20:51,406
Easy. I'll fix it for you after I come back.

225
00:20:51,406 --> 00:20:53,527
What's wrong with you? I said I don't want to fix it anymore!

226
00:20:53,527 --> 00:20:55,427
I'll close the door for you. It'll be safer.

227
00:20:57,206 --> 00:20:58,996
What the hell?

228
00:21:00,087 --> 00:21:01,916
Open the door!

229
00:21:16,047 --> 00:21:19,906
You dare to laugh at me! Just you wait!

230
00:21:55,087 --> 00:21:57,387
What a bunch of scoundrels.

231
00:21:57,387 --> 00:21:59,946
They parked their car in the way and still think they are in the right.

232
00:21:59,946 --> 00:22:02,106
They deserve a good beating.

233
00:22:07,607 --> 00:22:09,432
What's wrong, Juan?

234
00:22:10,287 --> 00:22:11,947
Where's the pen?

235
00:22:11,947 --> 00:22:13,726
Why is it gone?

236
00:22:14,446 --> 00:22:16,444
And where's that girl?

237
00:22:19,726 --> 00:22:22,626
I locked her inside! Why is she gone?

238
00:22:22,626 --> 00:22:25,147
<i>I'm in a hurry and have to leave now.</i>

239
00:22:25,147 --> 00:22:27,047
<i>This bracelet is very important to me.</i>

240
00:22:27,047 --> 00:22:29,227
<i>I'm leaving Pucheng tomorrow.</i>

241
00:22:29,227 --> 00:22:31,947
<i>Please be sure to fix it today.</i>

242
00:22:31,947 --> 00:22:35,287
<i>I'll come to pick it up tonight or tomorrow.</i>

243
00:22:35,287 --> 00:22:39,187
<i>I'll keep your pen as collateral.</i>

244
00:22:39,187 --> 00:22:41,607
<i>If you don't want to come all the way to Huaicheng to get it back,</i>

245
00:22:41,607 --> 00:22:44,686
<i>then please hurry up and fix my bracelet as an exchange.</i>

246
00:23:11,807 --> 00:23:13,287
What did you mean just now?

247
00:23:13,287 --> 00:23:15,926
Why did you say that I need to stay in Pucheng in the future?

248
00:23:15,926 --> 00:23:17,127
Where's my mom?

249
00:23:17,127 --> 00:23:19,427
Left. She went home.

250
00:23:19,427 --> 00:23:20,980
Wait!

251
00:23:24,686 --> 00:23:26,746
I called you here

252
00:23:26,746 --> 00:23:28,427
because I wanted you to see for yourself

253
00:23:28,427 --> 00:23:30,807
who was doing things behind your back,

254
00:23:30,807 --> 00:23:32,786
and who doesn't want you anymore.

255
00:23:32,786 --> 00:23:35,087
Although you're late, it doesn't matter.

256
00:23:35,087 --> 00:23:36,756
See?

257
00:23:37,646 --> 00:23:39,907
Your transfer procedures. She has already arranged them for you.

258
00:23:39,907 --> 00:23:43,066
<i>[Transfer Proof]</i> 
 You'll stay and study at Liying High School.

259
00:23:43,746 --> 00:23:47,586
Your mom did all of this.

260
00:23:47,586 --> 00:23:50,327
<i>[Lin Zhi]</i> 
 And she didn't let me tell you.

261
00:24:07,287 --> 00:24:10,707
Yujing, you will live with me in the future.

262
00:24:11,887 --> 00:24:16,007
I guess you already know

263
00:24:16,007 --> 00:24:18,267
how to get along with Aunt Guan and her son. Right?

264
00:24:24,807 --> 00:24:27,746
Where are you going? Come back!

265
00:24:27,746 --> 00:24:29,504
Lin Yujing!

266
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:45,707
Where are you going?

267
00:24:45,707 --> 00:24:47,344
Take me to the airport.

268
00:24:55,767 --> 00:24:58,066
Mom, where are you?

269
00:24:58,966 --> 00:25:02,486
<i>Yu, you'll stay with your dad for a while.</i>

270
00:25:02,486 --> 00:25:04,646
So you intentionally deceived me into going to Pucheng.

271
00:25:04,646 --> 00:25:06,206
You two planned it behind my back. Right?

272
00:25:06,206 --> 00:25:08,287
Why are you asking me to live with Meng Weiguo?

273
00:25:08,287 --> 00:25:10,266
Has he ever taken care of me?

274
00:25:10,266 --> 00:25:12,826
<i>I'm doing this for your own good.</i>

275
00:25:12,826 --> 00:25:14,907
You'll understand later.

276
00:25:15,686 --> 00:25:17,687
<i>For my own good?</i>

277
00:25:18,347 --> 00:25:21,026
When you guys divorced, you said you wanted me to live with you.

278
00:25:21,026 --> 00:25:23,586
I thought you loved me.

279
00:25:27,247 --> 00:25:29,046
Now you also abandoned me.

280
00:25:29,846 --> 00:25:31,607
I'm completely homeless.

281
00:25:31,607 --> 00:25:33,587
<i>I didn't abandon you.</i>

282
00:25:33,587 --> 00:25:35,527
Take care of yourself.

283
00:25:35,527 --> 00:25:39,427
You've only cared about my studies.

284
00:25:39,427 --> 00:25:41,446
So, everything else was taken care of by myself.

285
00:25:41,446 --> 00:25:43,206
I don't need your reminder.

286
00:25:43,206 --> 00:25:45,006
<i>All transfer procedures have been completed.</i>

287
00:25:45,006 --> 00:25:47,087
<i>You just focus on studying in Pucheng.</i>

288
00:25:47,087 --> 00:25:49,906
As for the rest, I'll handle it.

289
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:54,904
Hey!

290
00:27:08,507 --> 00:27:10,387
<i>Huh! It's really you!</i>

291
00:27:10,387 --> 00:27:14,367
<i>You laughed at me while hiding in that store.</i>

292
00:27:14,367 --> 00:27:18,066
<i>Where's Shen Juan? Where is he?</i>

293
00:27:18,066 --> 00:27:20,026
<i>Tell him to come out!</i>

294
00:27:20,026 --> 00:27:23,926
<i>Otherwise, I will start dealing with you!</i>

295
00:27:26,387 --> 00:27:29,846
You arrogant woman! Can't you understand my words?

296
00:27:29,846 --> 00:27:32,847
I really need to teach you a lesson. Just you wait!

297
00:27:36,087 --> 00:27:38,006
Stay there!

298
00:27:39,327 --> 00:27:41,266
It seems you've already recovered.

299
00:27:41,266 --> 00:27:45,486
You're expecting to be beaten up again within the same day, aren't you?

300
00:27:47,807 --> 00:27:50,287
Don't be smug! My bro is here to back me up!

301
00:27:50,287 --> 00:27:52,446
Listen, my bro is… My bro is inside!

302
00:27:52,446 --> 00:27:53,567
Stop! Don't follow me! What do you want?

303
00:27:53,567 --> 00:27:56,646
Bro, help! Go away! Bro!

304
00:27:56,646 --> 00:27:58,646
Bro! Bro!

305
00:27:58,646 --> 00:27:59,767
Stop right there! Don't come any closer!

306
00:27:59,767 --> 00:28:01,287
Bro! Bro!

307
00:28:01,287 --> 00:28:02,726
Bro, something happened.

308
00:28:02,726 --> 00:28:04,686
Bro!

309
00:28:04,686 --> 00:28:06,686
Bro, that's him!

310
00:28:06,686 --> 00:28:08,867
Let me tell you! My bro

311
00:28:08,867 --> 00:28:10,586
is an 8th Dan black belt in Taekwondo.

312
00:28:10,586 --> 00:28:13,266
If you kneel down now and admit your mistake, the consequence might not be severe.

313
00:28:13,266 --> 00:28:16,626
- Otherwise, my bro… 
 - All right, all right.

314
00:28:17,847 --> 00:28:19,047
Hurry up.

315
00:28:19,047 --> 00:28:20,907
For what?

316
00:28:20,907 --> 00:28:23,127
Come at me. I haven't finished my homework yet.

317
00:28:23,127 --> 00:28:24,560
Homework?

318
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:27,180
Bro, he insulted you!

319
00:28:34,926 --> 00:28:36,632
Bro!

320
00:28:46,726 --> 00:28:49,146
Why didn't you wait for us?

321
00:28:54,087 --> 00:28:57,487
Hello? I want to report a crime.

322
00:28:57,487 --> 00:28:59,024
Some people are fighting nearby.

323
00:28:59,024 --> 00:29:01,047
I'm sorry, I…

324
00:29:01,047 --> 00:29:02,612
Get over here!

325
00:29:34,427 --> 00:29:37,627
Your bracelet isn't hard to fix.

326
00:29:37,627 --> 00:29:39,646
I just need some more time.

327
00:29:40,206 --> 00:29:43,926
Give me three days. I'll fix it and send it to Huaicheng.

328
00:29:43,926 --> 00:29:45,867
You can give me your address.

329
00:29:51,527 --> 00:29:54,066
No need. I can't go back now.

330
00:29:55,686 --> 00:29:57,564
Wait a moment.

331
00:30:09,206 --> 00:30:11,026
Your food dropped on the floor.

332
00:30:11,026 --> 00:30:13,066
Here's a new one.

333
00:31:30,206 --> 00:31:33,387
You're back. Have you eaten?

334
00:31:33,387 --> 00:31:35,106
I'll make you something.

335
00:31:35,106 --> 00:31:38,346
No need, I've eaten. Thank you.

336
00:31:41,047 --> 00:31:42,684
Stop.

337
00:31:45,327 --> 00:31:47,127
Don't you know what time it is?

338
00:31:47,127 --> 00:31:49,266
Where have you been?

339
00:31:49,266 --> 00:31:51,146
Tell me!

340
00:31:51,646 --> 00:31:54,166
Hush! She has already come back.

341
00:31:54,166 --> 00:31:56,766
Yujing, go back to your room and rest.

342
00:31:58,366 --> 00:32:01,126
The transfer procedures are all done. School starts tomorrow.

343
00:32:01,126 --> 00:32:03,686
You'd better be obedient and go to school.

344
00:32:11,926 --> 00:32:14,847
<i>Haven't you always liked this bracelet?</i>

345
00:32:15,346 --> 00:32:17,267
<i>It's yours now.</i>

346
00:32:18,247 --> 00:32:19,947
<i>Didn't we agree?</i>

347
00:32:19,947 --> 00:32:22,206
<i>You'll stay in Pucheng for a few days.</i>

348
00:32:22,206 --> 00:32:24,487
<i>Meet your dad's family and then come back.</i>

349
00:32:26,926 --> 00:32:30,467
<i>What did your mom tell you before you came to Pucheng?</i>

350
00:32:30,467 --> 00:32:35,086
<i>It's due to my negligence. I didn't ask her what she likes to eat. I just randomly made these dishes.</i>

351
00:32:35,086 --> 00:32:38,406
<i>But in Pucheng, we prefer bland food. You'll have to get used to it in the future.</i>

352
00:32:38,406 --> 00:32:40,227
<i>Did you bring enough clothes?</i>

353
00:32:40,227 --> 00:32:42,427
<i>If not, we'll buy some tomorrow.</i>

354
00:32:43,847 --> 00:32:46,527
<i>Why? I'm going back the day after tomorrow.</i>

355
00:32:46,527 --> 00:32:47,767
<i>And there's no need to buy winter clothes.</i>

356
00:32:47,767 --> 00:32:49,607
<i>I called you here</i>

357
00:32:49,607 --> 00:32:51,406
<i>just to let you see for yourself</i>

358
00:32:51,406 --> 00:32:53,406
<i>who was doing things behind your back...</i>

359
00:32:53,406 --> 00:32:55,246
<i>I have completed all the transfer procedures.</i>

360
00:32:55,246 --> 00:32:57,306
<i>You just focus on studying in Pucheng.</i>

361
00:32:57,306 --> 00:33:00,546
<i>As for the rest, I'll handle it.</i>

362
00:33:17,037 --> 00:33:19,607
<i>[Liying High School]</i>

363
00:33:19,607 --> 00:33:21,607
<i>You're Lin Yujing. Right?</i>

364
00:33:22,486 --> 00:33:25,106
<i>Welcome to Liying High School.</i>

365
00:33:25,106 --> 00:33:28,346
We don't have a very long history.

366
00:33:28,346 --> 00:33:32,306
But our teaching facilities are still very new

367
00:33:32,306 --> 00:33:34,807
and our teachers are all very young.

368
00:33:34,807 --> 00:33:38,406
The quality of our teachers and teaching

369
00:33:38,406 --> 00:33:41,047
can definitely be guaranteed.

370
00:33:41,887 --> 00:33:43,926
Not to mention, just last year,

371
00:33:43,926 --> 00:33:47,507
do you know how many of our students got into top universities?

372
00:33:49,686 --> 00:33:51,146
How many?

373
00:33:51,146 --> 00:33:56,166
78%. Impressive, right?

374
00:33:56,166 --> 00:33:57,944
Is it not scary?

375
00:33:59,786 --> 00:34:01,806
That's our teaching building.

376
00:34:01,806 --> 00:34:03,847
The cafeteria is at the back.

377
00:34:03,847 --> 00:34:07,426
The dormitory is in front. Many students live on campus.

378
00:34:09,687 --> 00:34:12,387
I know you're a newcomer, but don't be nervous.

379
00:34:12,387 --> 00:34:15,806
Look at me. It's my first time being a homeroom teacher.

380
00:34:18,327 --> 00:34:21,366
To be honest, I'm quite nervous too.

381
00:34:23,647 --> 00:34:28,106
But I believe that all the students in our class are good kids.

382
00:34:29,287 --> 00:34:31,307
I can definitely lead them well.

383
00:34:31,307 --> 00:34:33,826
<i>Stop fighting! Stop!</i>

384
00:34:40,847 --> 00:34:43,406
The teacher is here!

385
00:34:43,406 --> 00:34:45,847
Go away!

386
00:34:45,847 --> 00:34:49,906
Who the hell drank my floral tea?!

387
00:34:53,767 --> 00:34:55,376
Sir, that's mine.

388
00:34:57,046 --> 00:35:00,866
Everyone, silence. The class is beginning.

389
00:35:06,727 --> 00:35:09,026
Liu Fuhong!

390
00:35:09,606 --> 00:35:11,766
Old Liu!

391
00:35:11,766 --> 00:35:13,606
My name is Liu Fujiang.

392
00:35:13,606 --> 00:35:15,486
I am your homeroom teacher.

393
00:35:15,486 --> 00:35:18,387
This is my first time being a homeroom teacher.

394
00:35:18,387 --> 00:35:21,086
I firmly believe that there are no unteachable students,

395
00:35:21,086 --> 00:35:22,767
only teachers who can't teach.

396
00:35:22,767 --> 00:35:25,106
That's right!

397
00:35:25,106 --> 00:35:27,987
When I just started teaching,

398
00:35:27,987 --> 00:35:30,567
once, a student was late,

399
00:35:30,567 --> 00:35:32,166
so I asked him why.

400
00:35:32,166 --> 00:35:33,966
Guess what he answered.

401
00:35:33,966 --> 00:35:35,526
<i>No idea.</i>

402
00:35:35,526 --> 00:35:37,006
<i>He actually said,</i>

403
00:35:37,006 --> 00:35:41,926
"Sir, I stayed up all night doing homework and overslept."

404
00:35:41,926 --> 00:35:43,767
How could I be mad at him?

405
00:35:43,767 --> 00:35:45,992
Such a good kid!

406
00:36:23,486 --> 00:36:27,126
Hello, sir. I stayed up all night doing homework, so I'm late.

407
00:36:27,126 --> 00:36:29,467
You're Shen Juan. Right?

408
00:36:29,467 --> 00:36:33,126
It's the first day of school. It's okay if you're a bit late.

409
00:36:33,126 --> 00:36:34,026
Thank you, sir.

410
00:36:34,026 --> 00:36:35,866
Then, where's your homework?

411
00:36:38,206 --> 00:36:39,832
I forgot to bring it.

412
00:36:40,806 --> 00:36:42,906
Don't forget to bring it tomorrow.

413
00:36:44,606 --> 00:36:47,386
All right. Go back to your seat.

414
00:36:56,887 --> 00:36:58,706
Can I sit here?

415
00:36:58,706 --> 00:37:00,767
Sure, sure.

416
00:37:12,006 --> 00:37:14,287
By the way, let me introduce her to you.

417
00:37:14,287 --> 00:37:17,467
This is your new classmate, Lin Yujing.

418
00:37:17,467 --> 00:37:19,847
Let's welcome her with applause.

419
00:37:23,606 --> 00:37:26,767
Lin Yujing, you can be seated now.

420
00:37:48,767 --> 00:37:52,306
Lin Yujing. Lin Yujing!

421
00:37:59,066 --> 00:38:01,267
I'll give you the pen tomorrow.

422
00:38:07,247 --> 00:38:09,687
Okay, everyone is here.

423
00:38:09,687 --> 00:38:11,046
The class begins!

424
00:38:11,046 --> 00:38:12,720
Sir!

425
00:38:20,186 --> 00:38:21,620
Why are you late?

426
00:38:21,620 --> 00:38:25,020
Did you also stay up all night doing homework?

427
00:38:28,526 --> 00:38:30,287
Class is over! Finally.

428
00:38:30,287 --> 00:38:32,427
Class is over!

429
00:38:37,627 --> 00:38:42,027
Y-Y-You…

430
00:38:42,027 --> 00:38:43,087
Who are you?

431
00:38:43,087 --> 00:38:44,446
I'm Wang Yiyang.

432
00:38:44,446 --> 00:38:46,326
You're the one who took our…

433
00:38:46,326 --> 00:38:47,760
our…

434
00:38:49,087 --> 00:38:50,787
our treasure! That…

435
00:38:50,787 --> 00:38:54,026
You can't even talk straight after getting a haircut, can you?

436
00:38:54,026 --> 00:38:57,927
Juan, she's…

437
00:38:57,927 --> 00:38:59,644
Who is she?

438
00:39:09,046 --> 00:39:11,307
That can't be right.

439
00:39:11,307 --> 00:39:13,247
You two obviously know each other.

440
00:39:13,247 --> 00:39:15,647
Juan! Wait for me!

441
00:39:20,687 --> 00:39:22,527
Aren't you afraid?

442
00:39:23,446 --> 00:39:24,846
Afraid of what?

443
00:39:24,846 --> 00:39:26,226
Don't you know?

444
00:39:26,226 --> 00:39:30,066
Your deskmate Shen Juan repeated a grade.

445
00:39:30,066 --> 00:39:31,936
So what?

446
00:39:33,207 --> 00:39:37,147
Seems like only a newcomer like you dares to be his deskmate.

447
00:39:40,443 --> 00:39:43,800
<i>[Shen Juan]</i>

448
00:39:54,086 --> 00:39:56,167
New classmate, um…

449
00:39:56,167 --> 00:39:57,566
Are you new to our school

450
00:39:57,566 --> 00:40:00,006
and don't know where you can get something delicious?

451
00:40:00,006 --> 00:40:02,327
Do you need me to show you around?

452
00:40:02,327 --> 00:40:04,252
Okay.

453
00:40:05,126 --> 00:40:08,207
Their rice noodles are very nice, but they put too many green onions.

454
00:40:08,207 --> 00:40:10,887
If you don't like green onions, you'd better tell them in advance.

455
00:40:10,887 --> 00:40:13,446
Also, the ham sandwich over here.

456
00:40:13,446 --> 00:40:15,207
Their ham sandwich is really good.

457
00:40:15,207 --> 00:40:16,486
But don't order the one with cream filling.

458
00:40:16,486 --> 00:40:18,727
That filling is too greasy. I'm sure you wouldn't like it.

459
00:40:18,727 --> 00:40:21,166
How do you know all this?

460
00:40:21,166 --> 00:40:22,787
I'm the life committee member.

461
00:40:22,787 --> 00:40:24,566
Oh, right. Old Liu told me that

462
00:40:24,566 --> 00:40:25,847
I must show you around.

463
00:40:25,847 --> 00:40:27,386
Then you can get familiar with the campus environment.

464
00:40:27,386 --> 00:40:29,647
I saw you coming to the canteen, so I decided to show you around.

465
00:40:29,647 --> 00:40:30,486
Thanks.

466
00:40:30,486 --> 00:40:32,326
Don't mention it. We're classmates.

467
00:40:32,326 --> 00:40:34,546
Besides, our seats are quite close.

468
00:40:35,126 --> 00:40:37,247
You look so thin.

469
00:40:37,247 --> 00:40:40,187
Are you not used to the food since you just came to Pucheng?

470
00:40:40,187 --> 00:40:42,847
You must eat some more later.

471
00:40:43,727 --> 00:40:45,400
This here!

472
00:40:46,367 --> 00:40:49,046
This fried dumpling is a specialty of our school.

473
00:40:49,046 --> 00:40:51,827
Madam, we'll take all the remaining fried dumplings.

474
00:40:51,827 --> 00:40:53,167
Okay, please swipe your card.

475
00:40:53,167 --> 00:40:55,527
There you go. Swipe your card.

476
00:40:55,527 --> 00:40:56,767
What card?

477
00:40:56,767 --> 00:41:00,307
Campus card. You didn't apply for one, did you?

478
00:41:01,807 --> 00:41:04,327
No worries. I'll use mine.

479
00:41:11,126 --> 00:41:13,126
Try it.

480
00:41:13,126 --> 00:41:15,686
These fried dumplings are a signature of our school.

481
00:41:15,686 --> 00:41:18,726
Thanks. How much do I owe you?

482
00:41:18,726 --> 00:41:20,426
Not much.

483
00:41:32,327 --> 00:41:36,367
Today, Lin Yujing,

484
00:41:37,327 --> 00:41:43,226
owes Li Lin one portion of fried dumplings and a bottle of soy milk.

485
00:41:43,226 --> 00:41:48,227
That will be 15.5 yuan in total.

486
00:41:51,926 --> 00:41:54,767
Don't worry. You can pay me at the end of the month.

487
00:41:55,526 --> 00:41:58,106
Is that what you said? Speak up!

488
00:41:58,106 --> 00:42:00,226
Is that what you said or not?

489
00:42:00,226 --> 00:42:01,566
Why is Gu Xia so bossy?

490
00:42:01,566 --> 00:42:02,606
Let's go.

491
00:42:02,606 --> 00:42:04,247
Bossy? Her?

492
00:42:04,247 --> 00:42:07,726
Well, she's not as bossy as your deskmate.

493
00:42:07,726 --> 00:42:09,368
What do you mean?

494
00:42:10,367 --> 00:42:14,767
<i>New city, new family, new school.</i>

495
00:42:14,767 --> 00:42:17,666
<i>My world was turned upside down just because my mother said,</i>

496
00:42:17,666 --> 00:42:18,926
<i>"I'm doing it for your own good."</i>

497
00:42:18,926 --> 00:42:21,867
<i>Adults always use this sentence to justify their actions.</i>

498
00:42:21,867 --> 00:42:25,647
<i>As if one day in the future, we will grow up</i>

499
00:42:25,647 --> 00:42:29,200
<i>and understand their intentions.</i>
