<i>[Episode 23 We Will Not Break Up]</i>

19
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:38,920
Hello. I'm Shen Juan. I'm Lin--

20
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:40,032
I know who you are.

21
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,159
- You break up with her.
- I can't.

22
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,879
So, I hope

23
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:46,799
you can consider it

24
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:47,879
think more for her,

25
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:49,920
and accept her request.

26
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:05,088
Ms. Lin.

27
00:02:05,719 --> 00:02:06,920
I've said all I wanted to say.

28
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,840
Hope you will be well soon.

29
00:02:29,639 --> 00:02:30,688
Well,

30
00:02:31,879 --> 00:02:33,840
I rushed back without eating anything.

31
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,840
I'm hungry.

32
00:02:36,439 --> 00:02:37,536
Let's go grab some food.

33
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:50,840
Doesn't your leaving affect your training?

34
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:54,240
No problem.
I've asked for leave from Coach Lei.

35
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:04,256
Don't worry.

36
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,039
Everything will get better.

37
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,879
You're already doing great.

38
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,479
In fact,

39
00:03:17,479 --> 00:03:19,319
I didn't tell you about my mom's illness

40
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,680
not just because you have a competition.

41
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:27,479
I've been used to doing things alone
since I was young.

42
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:30,520
I don't want to rely on

43
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,159
or be a burden to anyone.

44
00:03:34,599 --> 00:03:36,560
But when my mom is sick,

45
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,919
I found out that everyone cares about

46
00:03:40,599 --> 00:03:41,664
and takes care of me,

47
00:03:43,759 --> 00:03:44,896
including my brother

48
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,256
and you.

49
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,599
So I think I should try

50
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:56,599
to share with you what's on my mind

51
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:58,879
and open my heart

52
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:00,120
slowly.

53
00:04:04,439 --> 00:04:05,440
I understand.

54
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:09,120
It's okay.

55
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:11,840
Take your time.

56
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:19,560
Actually, at first,

57
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,040
when I heard about your mom's illness,

58
00:04:21,879 --> 00:04:23,584
I didn't know what to do.

59
00:04:23,584 --> 00:04:25,600
I rushed back in a panic.

60
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,160
I didn't expect

61
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,920
your mom's misunderstanding of me is deep.

62
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:34,680
All misunderstandings will be cleared up.

63
00:04:37,959 --> 00:04:39,439
I won't break up with you.

64
00:04:48,759 --> 00:04:49,959
We make a deal.

65
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:53,800
No matter what difficulties we encounter,

66
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,240
we will face them together.

67
00:05:01,079 --> 00:05:02,112
Let's eat.

68
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:19,240
<i>I understand</i>

69
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,959
<i>the pain of helplessness</i>

70
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:22,480
<i>after losing a loved one.</i>

71
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,319
<i>I've done everything I can.</i>

72
00:05:25,319 --> 00:05:27,279
<i>I have no choice.</i>

73
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,240
<i>I can do anything for you.</i>

74
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,720
<i>I just want you to be healthy.</i>

75
00:05:32,519 --> 00:05:33,632
<i>Because she loves you</i>

76
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:35,920
<i>and doesn't want to lose you.</i>

77
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,040
My surgery…

78
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:07,920
When is it scheduled?

79
00:06:14,199 --> 00:06:15,560
I'll go ask the doctor right now.

80
00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:28,560
Didn't I tell you to go back for a rest?

81
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,120
Why did you buy so many things again?

82
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,079
I have experience with caregiving.

83
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,680
I bought something for your mom.

84
00:06:36,879 --> 00:06:38,199
I have good news for you.

85
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:39,519
My mom agreed to the surgery.

86
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,639
You don't have to worry anymore.

87
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,439
Anyway, I can take good care of her.

88
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:49,319
Go back and train hard.

89
00:06:50,839 --> 00:06:51,840
Alright.

90
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,199
You leave first.

91
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:58,272
I will watch you go.

92
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,600
I want

93
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,600
to see you leave.

94
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,032
I'm leaving then.

95
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,520
Shen Juan.

96
00:07:20,839 --> 00:07:21,920
Keep it up.

97
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:34,368
See you.

98
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,248
Bye.

99
00:07:48,399 --> 00:07:49,600
Mr. Fu.

100
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,920
The books you sent me are obscure.

101
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:55,232
I'm struggling with the reading.

102
00:07:55,232 --> 00:07:57,920
Do you have any academic papers?

103
00:07:58,959 --> 00:08:00,639
Academic papers?

104
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:04,639
You mean papers
that discuss legal issues in cyberspace

105
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:06,360
with case studies, analysis,

106
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,439
preferably with insights

107
00:08:07,439 --> 00:08:08,839
on further improving

108
00:08:08,839 --> 00:08:10,279
space management.

109
00:08:10,279 --> 00:08:12,279
Yes, that's it.

110
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,959
I will have one after I finish writing for you.

111
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,040
That's not what I meant.

112
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,639
The point is,

113
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:22,480
the new semester is not far off.

114
00:08:23,319 --> 00:08:26,079
I can barely get through your books,

115
00:08:26,079 --> 00:08:27,712
but I won't have time to write afterwards.

116
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,160
I can't keep asking you questions

117
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,439
all the time.

118
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,120
You'll definitely find me dumb

119
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,240
and annoying.

120
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,240
How would you know without trying?

121
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:39,240
Okay, I'll start compiling questions now.

122
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:40,832
No.

123
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,320
Why haven't you gone back yet?

124
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,656
Coach Lei.

125
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,519
I didn't do the live ammunition training
this morning.

126
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:23,919
Gun control training,

127
00:09:23,919 --> 00:09:25,024
I need to make up for it.

128
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,240
Have you looked at your recent shooting data?

129
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:33,824
Do you know your problem?

130
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,464
My first shot accuracy is too low,

131
00:09:38,464 --> 00:09:40,064
which affects

132
00:09:40,064 --> 00:09:41,480
the second shot,

133
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,528
and the third shot.

134
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,519
To improve the first shot accuracy,

135
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:54,656
only by specifically training your hands

136
00:09:54,656 --> 00:09:56,064
and shoulders,

137
00:09:56,064 --> 00:09:57,152
can your strength

138
00:09:57,152 --> 00:09:58,159
be strong and stable enough.

139
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,000
I will send you an additional training plan,

140
00:10:04,639 --> 00:10:08,460
but you must promise me not
to affect our regular training.

141
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:09,536
Okay.

142
00:10:45,739 --> 00:10:46,816
Again.

143
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,640
Again.

144
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,840
Mr. Fu.

145
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:53,480
I've sent you the questions about my thesis.
Did you receive the file?

146
00:12:00,559 --> 00:12:01,664
Yes.

147
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:08,360
You have too many questions.

148
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,360
I can't explain it clearly on the phone.

149
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,840
Why don't we talk about it in person?

150
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,159
Are you free now?

151
00:12:13,159 --> 00:12:14,480
Sure.

152
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,279
Let's meet at the coffee shop
near the law firm.

153
00:12:17,919 --> 00:12:18,976
Okay.

154
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,216
Not bad.

155
00:12:41,216 --> 00:12:43,000
It's quite novel.

156
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:49,679
Why are you laughing?

157
00:12:49,679 --> 00:12:50,688
What do you think?

158
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,840
Considering you sneakily filmed me
when I was drunk,

159
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,279
I'm already being very nice talking to you.

160
00:12:59,039 --> 00:13:01,120
Yes, you're magnanimous.

161
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,559
I'm grateful.

162
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,720
The overall framework is okay,

163
00:13:10,559 --> 00:13:11,639
but the order needs

164
00:13:11,639 --> 00:13:12,840
to be changed.

165
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,559
Move the first sentence of the first chapter

166
00:13:16,559 --> 00:13:17,600
to…

167
00:13:50,159 --> 00:13:53,279
I'm just telling you the date
for my competition.

168
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:55,159
I know. It's the 18th, right?

169
00:13:55,159 --> 00:13:56,399
This is your first competition

170
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:57,856
since returning to the field.

171
00:13:57,856 --> 00:13:59,240
I will definitely be there.

172
00:13:59,919 --> 00:14:01,200
I'll talk to Lin Yujing

173
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,240
about booking the tickets later.

174
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,720
Lin Yujing

175
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:08,576
has a little situation.

176
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,616
Okay.

177
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:13,639
I got it.

178
00:14:13,639 --> 00:14:14,688
See you then.

179
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:18,519
What's wrong? Did anything happen to Shen Juan?

180
00:14:20,519 --> 00:14:21,919
It's Lin Yujing.

181
00:14:21,919 --> 00:14:22,919
Her mother is sick.

182
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:35,039
Gu Xia.

183
00:14:35,039 --> 00:14:37,159
Xu Ruyi, you're here too.

184
00:14:39,919 --> 00:14:43,559
- When did you know her mom is sick?
- I…

185
00:14:43,559 --> 00:14:44,640
How come you all are here?

186
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,320
We came coincidentally.

187
00:14:51,039 --> 00:14:52,480
Where is your mom?

188
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,360
I just sent her for a check-up.

189
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:57,759
Check-up? Is she going to have surgery?

190
00:14:58,759 --> 00:15:01,200
Why didn't you tell us about this?

191
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,679
I found out
when I heard from the dormitory supervisor

192
00:15:02,679 --> 00:15:04,559
that you were asking for leave
to stay out overnight.

193
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,759
Don't you consider us your friends?

194
00:15:06,759 --> 00:15:08,399
You didn't even tell us about such a big thing.

195
00:15:09,159 --> 00:15:10,960
It happened too fast.

196
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,600
I didn't mean to hide it from you.

197
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14,200
I just didn't want to make you worry.

198
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,799
When is the surgery? Is it scheduled?

199
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,440
It's on the 18th.

200
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,759
I heard from He Songnan

201
00:15:22,759 --> 00:15:24,919
that Shen Juan's competition is also
on the 18th.

202
00:15:26,279 --> 00:15:28,799
I'll accompany you for your mom's surgery.

203
00:15:28,799 --> 00:15:31,000
It's fine. My brother will be there that day.

204
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,399
And it's not good

205
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:33,480
to have too many people in the hospital.

206
00:15:34,679 --> 00:15:35,720
Well,

207
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:38,080
don't bear everything on your own.

208
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:40,440
We're all here.
Let us know if anything happens.

209
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:43,639
Remember to tell us if anything happens.

210
00:15:43,639 --> 00:15:44,704
We're all here for you.

211
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,232
Okay.

212
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:56,759
Ning Yuan, three points.

213
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,360
Shen Juan, three points.

214
00:16:06,519 --> 00:16:08,480
Shen Juan and Ning Yuan go to overtime.

215
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,279
Ning Yuan, get ready.

216
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:22,759
Shen Juan, get ready.

217
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:35,840
Shen Juan, Ning Yuan, second round of overtime.

218
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,080
Be ready.

219
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:54,360
Shen Juan, get ready.

220
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,319
Shen Juan, three points.

221
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,000
Shen Juan eliminated.

222
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:03,720
Go on.

223
00:18:05,279 --> 00:18:07,200
It's the last game

224
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,079
of this training session.

225
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,079
Everyone has improved.

226
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,799
This training session is effective.

227
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,920
I declare

228
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:18,200
this training session is over.

229
00:18:21,319 --> 00:18:23,400
Tomorrow will be the National University Games.

230
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:25,184
Go back and have a good rest.

231
00:18:25,184 --> 00:18:26,720
Rest up,

232
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:27,759
and do your best in tomorrow's game.

233
00:18:29,799 --> 00:18:30,880
Dismissed.

234
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:39,279
- See you at the competition tomorrow.
- See you.

235
00:18:39,279 --> 00:18:40,319
See you tomorrow.

236
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,208
Let's go.

237
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:47,799
Bye.

238
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:49,856
Keep it up.

239
00:18:49,856 --> 00:18:51,039
See you at the competition tomorrow.

240
00:18:54,519 --> 00:18:55,520
Alright.

241
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:06,279
<i>Can we have a video call?</i>

242
00:20:24,759 --> 00:20:25,759
You've finished training?

243
00:20:29,359 --> 00:20:30,640
You have a competition tomorrow.

244
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,480
Rest early.

245
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:33,568
Okay.

246
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:35,920
How's the surgery scheduled?

247
00:20:37,559 --> 00:20:38,640
It's tomorrow.

248
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:42,000
Okay, I'll rush over
as soon as my competition ends.

249
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,319
My brother will accompany me.

250
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,640
<i>You just focus on your competition.</i>

251
00:20:49,079 --> 00:20:50,208
Okay.

252
00:20:51,519 --> 00:20:53,359
I will watch the live broadcast
of your competition.

253
00:20:56,079 --> 00:20:57,216
Go for it, Juan.

254
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,000
Okay.

255
00:21:01,319 --> 00:21:02,640
Good night.

256
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:03,712
Good night.

257
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,519
Hello, everyone.

258
00:21:24,519 --> 00:21:25,680
Welcome

259
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:27,480
to the third National University Games.

260
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:29,440
What's about to start

261
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,319
is the individual heats
for men's 25m rapid fire.

262
00:21:31,319 --> 00:21:33,480
This is also the team competition
for this event.

263
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:35,559
Please welcome the athletes to enter the field.

264
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:39,000
The athletes are entering.

265
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,160
Right now,

266
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:42,359
let me introduce the rules of the game.

267
00:21:43,119 --> 00:21:46,000
Two contestants will take turns
at the same shooting position,

268
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,920
shooting at five targets.

269
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:49,440
All single shooting scores are included

270
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,496
in the total score.

271
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:54,440
This preliminary consists of two rounds.

272
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:55,880
After two rounds,

273
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:57,640
the top six players

274
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:58,839
will enter the finals.

275
00:21:58,839 --> 00:22:00,519
After the individual scores are added up,

276
00:22:00,519 --> 00:22:02,688
the final team competition ranking
is determined.

277
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:05,039
Now, Jiangcheng University,

278
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:06,880
Yuzhong University,

279
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,440
and Pucheng University's shooting teams

280
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:10,039
have sent contestants

281
00:22:10,039 --> 00:22:12,256
to fight for the team competition medals.

282
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,759
The athletes are ready.

283
00:22:15,759 --> 00:22:17,599
The competition officially begins.

284
00:22:19,279 --> 00:22:21,039
This is the procedure of the surgery.

285
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:22,640
You sign it to approve the surgery.

286
00:22:33,127 --> 00:22:35,040
<i>[In Operation]</i>

287
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,680
Next up, Shen Juan.

288
00:22:41,759 --> 00:22:42,880
Shen Juan.

289
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,319
It's your turn. Go ahead.

290
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,240
What happens now

291
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:02,336
is the men's 25-meter rapid fire heats,

292
00:23:02,336 --> 00:23:04,839
which is also the team game for this event.

293
00:23:08,119 --> 00:23:11,079
The group that's up now is the last
of the first stage.

294
00:23:11,599 --> 00:23:12,880
Let's look forward to

295
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,799
the athletes' outstanding performance.

296
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:28,559
Attention.

297
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:40,519
Wang An ranks first. Li Xiang ranks second.

298
00:23:40,519 --> 00:23:42,359
Sui Yu Li Xiang third. Ning Yuan ranks fourth.

299
00:23:42,359 --> 00:23:43,488
Zhang Zhicheng ranks fifth.

300
00:23:43,488 --> 00:23:45,440
Zheng Yu ranks sixth. Feng Xin ranks seventh.

301
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:46,519
Shen Juan ranks eighth.

302
00:23:46,519 --> 00:23:47,960
Juan is in eighth place.

303
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,720
Is there still hope?

304
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:51,799
Don't worry. According to the rules,

305
00:23:51,799 --> 00:23:53,200
there are two rounds in the preliminaries.

306
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,240
The top six in the final results

307
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,519
move on to the finals.

308
00:23:55,519 --> 00:23:57,000
If Juan does well in the next round,

309
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
there should be no problem.

310
00:24:09,799 --> 00:24:11,759
Among the last few athletes,

311
00:24:11,759 --> 00:24:13,720
the one with the best chance
of making it to the finals

312
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:15,759
is Shen Juan from Pucheng University,

313
00:24:15,759 --> 00:24:17,472
currently ranked seventh.

314
00:24:18,279 --> 00:24:19,480
If he can score

315
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:20,640
above forty in this round,

316
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,440
he would surpass Zheng Yu,
who is in sixth place,

317
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:23,480
and meet his teammate Ning Yuan,

318
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:25,680
who ranks fourth,

319
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:27,119
in the finals.

320
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:33,728
Attention.

321
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:44,119
Shen Juan has scored forty-eight points.

322
00:24:44,119 --> 00:24:45,799
Congratulations to Shen Juan
for making it to the finals.

323
00:24:45,799 --> 00:24:46,920
This year, Pucheng University Shooting Team

324
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:48,079
has performed brilliantly.

325
00:24:48,079 --> 00:24:49,440
Congratulations
to the Pucheng University Shooting Team

326
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,759
for winning the bronze medal for this event.

327
00:24:51,759 --> 00:24:53,240
Congratulations
to the Jiangcheng University Shooting Team

328
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:54,559
for winning the gold medal.

329
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:56,720
Yuzhong University Shooting Team
won the silver medal.

330
00:25:03,599 --> 00:25:05,319
As the men's 25-meter rapid fire preliminaries

331
00:25:05,319 --> 00:25:07,000
have just been finished,

332
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,839
the top six athletes have emerged.

333
00:25:08,839 --> 00:25:09,984
They are Wang An,

334
00:25:09,984 --> 00:25:12,319
Li Xiang, Sui Yu,

335
00:25:12,319 --> 00:25:14,960
Ning Yuan, Zhang Zhicheng and Shen Juan.

336
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:22,720
What will happen next

337
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,064
is the men's 25-meter rapid fire

338
00:25:24,064 --> 00:25:25,720
individual event final.

339
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:27,680
Please welcome the six finalists.

340
00:25:28,359 --> 00:25:30,759
The rules for the finals are different
from the qualifying rounds.

341
00:25:30,759 --> 00:25:32,032
If an athlete shoot

342
00:25:32,032 --> 00:25:34,000
at 9.7 rings or above,

343
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,880
it counts as a hit and scores one point.

344
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:37,920
Below 9.7 rings, it's considered a miss.

345
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:38,976
Zero points.

346
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,160
Nice to see you again.

347
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:50,160
Congratulations
on your team winning the bronze medal.

348
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:52,640
Thanks.

349
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,079
And congrats
on your team defending the championship.

350
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:56,896
In the final,
you must hang in there for a while.

351
00:25:56,896 --> 00:25:58,720
It's no fun if you get eliminated too quickly.

352
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:00,920
Don't worry about me

353
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:03,000
but yourselves.

354
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:11,519
The six finalists

355
00:26:11,519 --> 00:26:13,559
are now standing at their respective positions.

356
00:26:13,559 --> 00:26:14,559
I announce

357
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:16,279
the men's 25-meter rapid fire

358
00:26:16,279 --> 00:26:17,799
officially begins.

359
00:26:17,799 --> 00:26:19,079
Many of the athletes

360
00:26:19,079 --> 00:26:20,519
in the final are quite familiar to everyone.

361
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:22,400
Shen Juan, who is on position F,

362
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,904
might not be well-known to you.

363
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:27,200
He won a medal
at the National Youth Shooting Championship

364
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,640
four years ago.

365
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,599
Today, he returns to the competition field.

366
00:26:30,599 --> 00:26:31,759
Let's look forward to

367
00:26:31,759 --> 00:26:33,184
his performance.

368
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,359
The second round is going on.

369
00:26:52,359 --> 00:26:53,568
Attention.

370
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:24,279
Dear audience,

371
00:27:24,279 --> 00:27:26,240
the fourth group of competition

372
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:27,936
is about to begin.

373
00:27:28,519 --> 00:27:29,599
Starting from this group,

374
00:27:29,599 --> 00:27:30,880
the lowest-ranked

375
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,480
of the six finalists will be eliminated.

376
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:33,536
What does that mean?

377
00:27:34,079 --> 00:27:35,240
From now on,

378
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:36,480
the elimination game starts.

379
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,960
The contestant
who ranks last will be eliminated.

380
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,384
Look how close the scores are now.

381
00:27:40,384 --> 00:27:41,759
The rankings can change any minute.

382
00:27:41,759 --> 00:27:43,559
So every round is very important.

383
00:27:43,559 --> 00:27:44,960
Juan is currently in fifth place.

384
00:27:45,559 --> 00:27:46,960
He must steady himself.

385
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:03,359
Firstly, congratulations to Zhang Zhicheng
from Yuzhong University Shooting Team

386
00:28:03,359 --> 00:28:05,240
for achieving sixth place in this game.

387
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:06,759
The remaining five contestants on the field

388
00:28:06,759 --> 00:28:08,599
will continue with the next round of the game.

389
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
It's a pity.

390
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
Ning Yuan made a mistake in this round,

391
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,480
only gaining two points,

392
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:33,984
and stopped at fifth place.

393
00:28:33,984 --> 00:28:35,424
But in this game,

394
00:28:35,424 --> 00:28:36,440
he has already

395
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:38,464
achieved his personal best score.

396
00:28:38,464 --> 00:28:40,519
Let's look forward to his performance

397
00:28:40,519 --> 00:28:41,799
in the future game.

398
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:44,279
Now there are four athletes on the field

399
00:28:44,279 --> 00:28:46,000
to compete in the last round.

400
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:47,880
Which three athletes

401
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:48,960
are qualified

402
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:51,039
- for the top three spots in this game?
- Take a break.

403
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:52,200
Let us wait and see.

404
00:28:58,480 --> 00:28:59,599
Attention.

405
00:29:07,599 --> 00:29:09,759
The competition for third place

406
00:29:09,759 --> 00:29:10,976
is very intense.

407
00:29:10,976 --> 00:29:12,000
In this round,

408
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,240
Sui Yu ranked first.

409
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:14,440
Li Xiang ranked second.

410
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:16,799
Wang An and Shen Juan had a tie.

411
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:17,920
Did I see it wrong?

412
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:19,680
Juan stands a chance of winning a medal.

413
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:21,880
So, what happens in this tie situation?

414
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:23,079
Do both of them tie for third place?

415
00:29:23,759 --> 00:29:26,319
In this case,
a tie-breaker round will be conducted,

416
00:29:26,319 --> 00:29:28,440
which means the two people
with the same score will compete

417
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:29,920
until a winner is determined.

418
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:30,920
Only after that will the final match

419
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:32,160
between the first and second place be held.

420
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:38,799
Since Wang An
and Shen Juan have the same score,

421
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:40,359
a tie-breaker will be conducted next.

422
00:29:40,359 --> 00:29:42,039
The first to shoot is Wang An.

423
00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:51,648
Attention.

424
00:29:58,559 --> 00:29:59,920
Wang An scored three points.

425
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:02,144
Now let's see
if Shen Juan can withstand the pressure.

426
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:16,200
Shen Juan also scored three points.

427
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:17,279
It's a tie again.

428
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:18,839
The second round of the tie-breaker
will be conducted next.

429
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,016
Attention.

430
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:46,688
Four points. Well done.

431
00:30:46,688 --> 00:30:48,920
Now the pressure is back on Shen Juan.

432
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:50,119
The scores of Wang An

433
00:30:50,119 --> 00:30:51,440
and Shen Juan are very close.

434
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:53,119
It's a breathtaking tie-breaker.

435
00:30:53,839 --> 00:30:56,400
In this round,
Shen Juan must hit four out of five shots

436
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,960
to catch up with Wang An.

437
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,559
As long as Shen Juan hits all five shots,

438
00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:04,720
he will secure a medal in this game.

439
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:35,839
He got five hits.

440
00:32:35,839 --> 00:32:37,376
Congratulations to Shen Juan
for winning the tie-breaker

441
00:32:37,376 --> 00:32:38,656
and advancing to the top three.

442
00:33:09,344 --> 00:33:10,400
<i>[In Operation]</i>

443
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:18,319
- How did it go?
- The surgery went smoothly.

444
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:21,056
However, the patient needs to be in the ICU

445
00:33:21,056 --> 00:33:22,240
for 24 hours of observation.

446
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:23,400
You can visit her later.

447
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,440
Thank you, doctor.

448
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:26,839
Thank you.

449
00:33:26,839 --> 00:33:28,880
We finally get over it.

450
00:33:30,519 --> 00:33:31,799
The third place goes

451
00:33:31,799 --> 00:33:33,599
to Shen Juan from Pucheng University.

452
00:33:41,759 --> 00:33:43,072
The second place goes

453
00:33:43,072 --> 00:33:44,880
to Li Xiang from Yuzhong University.

454
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:46,880
The champion goes

455
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,440
to Sui Yu from Jiangcheng University.

456
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:51,839
Now let's present the awards
to the winning contestants.

457
00:33:51,839 --> 00:33:52,864
Congratulations to all contestants

458
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:54,119
for achieving excellent results.

459
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:10,920
Alright, our award ceremony ends here.

460
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:14,079
Shen Juan.

461
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:15,648
You did well in the overtime match just now.

462
00:34:15,648 --> 00:34:16,704
Looking forward to our next game.

463
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:20,440
There are still three years left in college.
We have plenty of time for that.

464
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:24,760
- I'm expecting it.
- Me too.

465
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:27,000
- Bye.
- Bye.

466
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:35,639
Come on. Let's take a group photo.

467
00:34:39,559 --> 00:34:40,639
<i>The surgery was successful.</i>

468

<i>That means</i>

483
00:36:03,418 --> 00:36:04,898
<i>I can loss many things</i>

484
00:36:05,538 --> 00:36:07,018
