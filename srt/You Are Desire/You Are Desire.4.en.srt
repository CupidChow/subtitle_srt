00:01:34,370 --> 00:01:37,570
To encourage students to study hard,

20
00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:40,170
our school awards scholarships for high academic achievement.

21
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:41,910
As long as you rank in the top ten

22
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:43,850
in our grade or first in our class,

23
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:46,349
you may get a scholarship.

24
00:01:48,130 --> 00:01:51,949
I can hope for the first place if I work hard.

25
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:57,250
Wang Yiyang, how poor your grades are.

26
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:59,229
You didn't even pass physics.

27
00:01:59,229 --> 00:02:01,130
Don't make a fuss.

28
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:02,769
You think that's what I want?

29
00:02:02,769 --> 00:02:04,370
Can I pass it?

30
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:06,570
You have given up before giving it a try.

31
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:08,289
That's why you always fail.

32
00:02:08,289 --> 00:02:12,090
Juan. Can you help me?

33
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:14,329
You asked him for help?

34
00:02:14,329 --> 00:02:16,850
His name is not even on this list.

35
00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:18,889
How did you do on your test?

36
00:02:20,369 --> 00:02:23,729
It was okay.

37
00:02:23,729 --> 00:02:26,130
Deskmates should care for and help each other,

38
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:28,549
so we should learn together to make progress.

39
00:02:28,549 --> 00:02:31,310
How are you going to care for me?

40
00:02:31,972 --> 00:02:33,560
Sit.

41
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:37,010
Let's start the lesson.

42
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:45,190
The two of you clean that part of the blackboard.

43
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:46,349
And as our teacher said,

44
00:02:46,349 --> 00:02:48,510
the trash can should be placed
in the designated place.

45
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:50,790
When I came to the classroom this morning,

46
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:53,190
I saw a notice posted outside the dormitory.

47
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:56,270
The dormitory application deadline
is approaching.

48
00:02:56,270 --> 00:02:58,369
Are you still applying for it?

49
00:02:58,369 --> 00:03:00,810
Yes. But I'm a little short of money.

50
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:01,950
But I'll get enough money soon.

51
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:05,390
Don't your parents give you money?

52
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:08,710
It's my idea, so they don't know.

53
00:03:10,209 --> 00:03:11,849
Pass it to me.

54
00:03:11,849 --> 00:03:13,730
Block.

55
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:15,290
Juan.

56
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:17,310
You replace me.

57
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:20,030
I'm a bit tired. You go.

58
00:03:24,209 --> 00:03:26,809
You played well today.

59
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:31,790
Thank you for telling me.

60
00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:33,650
I'll ask you if I have any questions.

61
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:35,889
I need to move
into the dormitory as soon as possible.

62
00:03:35,889 --> 00:03:37,810
Throw it.

63
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:40,210
That freshman is quite pretty, huh?

64
00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:42,169
Yes.

65
00:03:42,169 --> 00:03:44,709
She's a sophomore.

66
00:03:44,709 --> 00:03:46,564
What?

67
00:03:47,369 --> 00:03:48,709
Impossible.

68
00:03:48,709 --> 00:03:50,489
How could I not know her?

69
00:03:50,489 --> 00:03:51,630
Let's chat her up.

70
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:53,076
Let's go.

71
00:03:56,929 --> 00:03:58,949
You almost hit us.

72
00:03:58,949 --> 00:04:00,492
I don't think so.

73
00:04:00,492 --> 00:04:02,190

76
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:42,569
What's wrong with you?

77
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:48,870
- She is my deskmate.
- So what?

78
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:51,080
Don't have designs on her.

<i>You work late at night for this store,</i>

80
00:05:27,469 --> 00:05:30,269

Where are you going?

85
00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:47,530
To the shop.

86
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:48,776
I'll go with you.

87
00:05:48,776 --> 00:05:52,170
Liu told me to make progress with you.

88
00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:57,976

89
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:03,348

90
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,560
Take it.

91
00:06:08,448 --> 00:06:09,472
What are you doing?

92
00:06:09,472 --> 00:06:11,789
It's a small gift.

93
00:06:11,789 --> 00:06:14,650
I want you to help me with my study.

94
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:22,049
Well, I really want to study hard.

95
00:06:22,049 --> 00:06:24,450
Call me Miss Lin, and I will help you.

96
00:06:25,890 --> 00:06:27,844
I'll think about it.

97
00:06:32,569 --> 00:06:36,609
So, A equals 1.0 Amp.

98
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:40,730
Can you understand this formula?

99
00:06:48,064 --> 00:06:49,120
I'm helping you guys.

100
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,649
I can't share my scholarship with you,

101
00:06:50,649 --> 00:06:52,270
but improving grades is a good thing, right?

102
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:54,509
Do you still want your sneakers?

103
00:06:54,509 --> 00:06:57,310
Yes, I dream about them.

104
00:06:57,310 --> 00:06:58,530
And you?

105
00:06:58,530 --> 00:07:00,850
Another home visit from Liu?

106
00:07:04,009 --> 00:07:06,809
What is the formula
that Dinosaur Wang taught in class?

107
00:07:14,689 --> 00:07:18,149
What is the formula that he taught in class?

108
00:07:19,489 --> 00:07:21,210
You don't want the shoes, do you?

109
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:23,249
<i>[Dad]</i>
You want a beating, right?

110
00:07:23,929 --> 00:07:26,356
I'll study.

111
00:07:26,356 --> 00:07:28,089
And you?

112
00:07:28,089 --> 00:07:29,504
What?

113
00:07:29,504 --> 00:07:32,450
Recite the gravitation formula.

114
00:07:56,964 --> 00:07:57,969
Are you still studying?

115
00:07:57,969 --> 00:08:00,440

116
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:03,936
There's no water in your cup.

117

Thank you.

118
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:07,489
You haven't even filled it.

119
00:08:08,948 --> 00:08:12,920

Alright.

121
00:08:18,029 --> 00:08:20,709
Is it used for studying?

122
00:08:21,864 --> 00:08:23,296
Go home early.

123
00:08:23,296 --> 00:08:25,092
Don't make your parents worry.

124
00:08:25,092 --> 00:08:27,210
Lock the door, okay?

125
00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:29,769
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

126
00:08:29,769 --> 00:08:31,570
Goodbye, uncle.

127
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:35,336
He is right.

128
00:08:37,284 --> 00:08:39,149
Where are you going?

129
00:08:39,149 --> 00:08:41,690
He, how come you're here?

130
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:43,889
I just came from the study room.

131
00:08:43,889 --> 00:08:46,849
A top student doesn't need extra lessons.

132
00:08:46,849 --> 00:08:48,549
Senior year is painful.

133
00:08:48,549 --> 00:08:50,730
You guys are doing pretty well.

134
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:52,230
We need your guidance.

135
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:55,009
I got midnight food.

136
00:08:55,009 --> 00:08:57,210
I'm going to make noodles.

137
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:02,489
Peanuts.

138
00:09:02,489 --> 00:09:04,590
What a surprise.

139
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:07,364
Is there a power outage?

140
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:11,420
I'll go check it out.

141
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:26,129
He, when I call you later, you push, okay?

142
00:09:26,129 --> 00:09:28,289
Okay, got it.

143
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:45,930
Shen Juan, is that the problem?

144
00:10:04,609 --> 00:10:06,850
He, push.

145
00:10:14,609 --> 00:10:16,690
It's so beautiful.

146
00:10:41,930 --> 00:10:44,210
This boy doesn't seem like you.

147
00:10:47,229 --> 00:10:49,129
Why did you turn it off?

148
00:10:49,129 --> 00:10:51,030
Let's get out of here.

149
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:53,210
They are still waiting for us.

150
00:11:11,129 --> 00:11:14,870
See, I told you Juan could do it.

151
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:18,270
It's getting late. You should go home.

152
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:20,690
You're kicking me out as soon as I arrive?

153
00:11:28,389 --> 00:11:29,910
We'll leave first. Come on.

154
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:31,269
Let me finish this.

155
00:11:31,269 --> 00:11:34,230
Stop it. Get out of here.

156
00:11:35,869 --> 00:11:38,204
- I'm leaving.
- See you.

157
00:11:38,204 --> 00:11:39,868
I'm leaving.

158
00:11:47,129 --> 00:11:49,330
Are you okay?

159
00:11:56,810 --> 00:11:59,669
You go home. I'll clean it up.

160
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,968
Okay.

161
00:12:06,769 --> 00:12:08,572
Miss Lin,

162
00:12:11,450 --> 00:12:13,212
thank you.

163
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:16,668
I'm leaving.

164
00:13:12,409 --> 00:13:15,730
I've seen all your papers.

165
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:23,770
The circuit diagrams you drew are like a mess.

166
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:25,430
The monthly exam is just around the corner.

167
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:28,430
If you draw the circuit diagrams

168
00:13:28,430 --> 00:13:30,650
like this again,

169
00:13:30,650 --> 00:13:33,609
you won't have marks.

170
00:13:33,609 --> 00:13:36,230
Do you all have rulers?

171
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:38,792
Buy it if you don't have one.

172
00:13:38,792 --> 00:13:40,348
Report.

173
00:13:41,344 --> 00:13:43,149
What's the matter?

174
00:13:43,149 --> 00:13:45,450
Are you late for buying a ruler?

175
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:48,189
You're late for my class.

176
00:13:48,189 --> 00:13:51,749
How dare you.

177
00:13:51,749 --> 00:13:54,049
Go back to your seat.

178
00:13:54,049 --> 00:13:56,129
I'll deal with you after class.

179
00:14:03,869 --> 00:14:07,970
I've taught you a million times about the closed circuit.

180
00:14:07,970 --> 00:14:10,689
Why can't you learn it?

181
00:14:10,689 --> 00:14:14,150
There are a few key points

182
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:16,889
about the closed circuit.

183
00:14:16,889 --> 00:14:19,289
I'll go over it one last time.

184
00:14:19,289 --> 00:14:21,890
Take your notes.

185
00:14:21,890 --> 00:14:25,229
Total power equals IE,

186
00:14:25,229 --> 00:14:29,609
equals external IU plus internal IU.

187
00:14:34,249 --> 00:14:35,960
Shen Juan.

188
00:14:38,050 --> 00:14:40,450
Which formula should you use here?

189
00:14:45,650 --> 00:14:47,256
Lin Yujing.

190
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:49,910
No passing notes.

191
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:52,850
Do you want him to cheat in the test?

192
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:54,620
Shen Juan.

193
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:57,450
You were late for my class.

194
00:14:57,450 --> 00:14:59,609
That isn't your first time.

195
00:14:59,609 --> 00:15:02,850
If you can't answer this question,

196
00:15:02,850 --> 00:15:05,009
write it a hundred times.

197
00:15:07,330 --> 00:15:10,930
Output power equals total P minus internal P,
which equals UI.

198
00:15:11,908 --> 00:15:15,650
Knowing the answer doesn't mean you'll do well on the test.

199
00:15:15,650 --> 00:15:16,770
This is basic knowledge.

200
00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:18,710
All of you listen carefully.

201
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:22,909
If any of you are late for my class,

202
00:15:22,909 --> 00:15:26,030
not listening, and not doing well on the tests,

203
00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:27,628
I'll talk to your parents.

204
00:15:27,628 --> 00:15:29,696
- Why is that?
- Who knows?

205
00:15:29,696 --> 00:15:31,430
Class dismissed.

206
00:15:32,629 --> 00:15:37,170
Thank you, Mr. Wang.

207
00:15:40,930 --> 00:15:45,949
How dare you be late for Dinosaur Wang's class.

208
00:15:45,949 --> 00:15:49,570
No need to thank me until do well on the monthly test.

209
00:15:49,570 --> 00:15:52,249
Actually, my physics is not bad.

210
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:49,750
<i>[From a kind person surnamed Lin,
who refuses to reveal her name]</i>

211
00:16:50,957 --> 00:16:56,090
From a kind person surnamed Lin,
who refuses to reveal her name.

212
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:55,890
I'm counting on you
to push Shen Juan and the others to study.

213
00:17:56,769 --> 00:17:58,569
Shen Juan is here.

214
00:17:58,569 --> 00:18:01,529
I just told Lin Yujing.

215
00:18:01,529 --> 00:18:02,529
You two are deskmates.

216
00:18:02,529 --> 00:18:04,429
You should help each other.

217
00:18:04,429 --> 00:18:06,370
The monthly test is coming up soon.

218
00:18:06,370 --> 00:18:10,170
Shen Juan, are you confident about that?

219
00:18:10,170 --> 00:18:12,148
- Actually, I--
- I promised Liu.

220
00:18:12,148 --> 00:18:14,520
I won't let you fail.

221
00:18:15,669 --> 00:18:17,668
You promised?

222
00:18:17,668 --> 00:18:19,230
So you have to cooperate with me.

223
00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:21,589
That's right.

224
00:18:21,589 --> 00:18:25,569
Shen Juan, you promised me.

225
00:18:25,569 --> 00:18:28,730
I hope you keep your word.

226
00:18:28,730 --> 00:18:31,050
Lin Yujing studies well.

227
00:18:31,050 --> 00:18:32,490
And she's your deskmate.

228
00:18:32,490 --> 00:18:34,970
Just ask her for help if you have any problems.

229
00:18:34,970 --> 00:18:36,390
Don't worry, Liu.

230
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:37,730
I've promised you.

231
00:18:37,730 --> 00:18:39,370
I will definitely push him hard.

232
00:18:39,370 --> 00:18:42,120
He won't hold our class down.

233
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:43,740
Good.

234
00:18:55,130 --> 00:18:58,730
I received a peculiar message yesterday,

235
00:19:00,130 --> 00:19:04,329
from a warm-hearted person surnamed Lin.

236
00:19:06,869 --> 00:19:09,649
She is really strange.

237
00:19:09,649 --> 00:19:11,329
She even posted a small ad.

238
00:19:11,329 --> 00:19:14,270
I almost filtered it out as spam.

239
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:16,688
So what happened?

240
00:19:16,688 --> 00:19:20,189
Well, I read it.

241
00:19:20,189 --> 00:19:23,569
I kept reading till five in the morning.

242
00:19:23,569 --> 00:19:25,920
You're making this difficult for me.

243
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:29,576
I prefer to do good deeds anonymously.

244
00:19:30,930 --> 00:19:34,450
Miss Lin, thank you.

245
00:19:46,690 --> 00:19:50,280
<i>[Test Day]</i>
After getting your test paper,

246
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:52,450
check it carefully.

247
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:03,450
Focus.

248
00:20:09,849 --> 00:20:12,070
Start now.

249
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:38,289
Only ten minutes left.

250
00:21:39,009 --> 00:21:40,930
if you've finished,
check your answers carefully.

251
00:21:41,450 --> 00:21:43,450
And check your names and test numbers.

252
00:22:19,289 --> 00:22:20,448
Juan.

253
00:22:21,610 --> 00:22:22,650
Guess what?

254
00:22:22,650 --> 00:22:24,529
I answered all the questions.

255
00:22:24,529 --> 00:22:25,850
I even answered the last one.

256
00:22:25,850 --> 00:22:27,089
I'm sure I'll pass this time,

257
00:22:27,650 --> 00:22:28,928
thanks to…

258
00:22:30,610 --> 00:22:31,712
Where is Lin Yujing?

259
00:22:39,170 --> 00:22:40,370
Why hasn't she come out yet?

260
00:22:40,890 --> 00:22:41,970
Did she not do well on the test?

261
00:22:48,970 --> 00:22:50,150
How did you do?

262
00:22:50,150 --> 00:22:52,130
Anyway, I'm sure I'll pass.

263
00:22:53,450 --> 00:22:55,264
Someone might fail, right?

264
00:22:55,264 --> 00:22:56,416
Who?

265
00:22:56,416 --> 00:22:57,669
You mean Juan?

266
00:22:57,669 --> 00:22:59,170
Impossible.

267
00:22:59,170 --> 00:23:00,310
Why impossible?

268
00:23:00,310 --> 00:23:01,569
He was sleeping during the test.

269
00:23:03,049 --> 00:23:04,249
I finished all the questions.

270
00:23:04,890 --> 00:23:05,930
Some were unfinished, right?

271
00:23:06,730 --> 00:23:07,890
I did okay.

272
00:23:08,650 --> 00:23:10,410
Let's see your scores later.

273
00:23:10,410 --> 00:23:12,090
I stayed up late to make you a study guide.

274
00:23:12,090 --> 00:23:13,389
I let Liu down.

275
00:23:13,389 --> 00:23:15,049
You made him a study guide?

276
00:23:15,849 --> 00:23:16,970
Why didn't I know about this?

277
00:23:17,769 --> 00:23:19,049
You could pass, right?

278
00:23:37,569 --> 00:23:39,570
Gu Xia, what are you doing?

279
00:23:39,570 --> 00:23:40,670
I'm checking the answers.

280
00:23:40,670 --> 00:23:42,080
Checking the answers?

281
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,730
The test is over.

282
00:23:43,730 --> 00:23:44,928
Stop checking.

283
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,370
What's wrong with you?

284
00:23:48,930 --> 00:23:49,984
Are you not feeling well?

285
00:23:51,809 --> 00:23:54,336
I don't think I did well on this test.

286
00:23:55,970 --> 00:23:57,550
No worries. It's just a monthly test.

287
00:23:57,550 --> 00:23:59,009
Just do well next time.

288
00:24:02,848 --> 00:24:03,970
You're always causing trouble.

289
00:24:04,529 --> 00:24:06,689
I'm not. It was an accident.

290
00:24:06,689 --> 00:24:08,230
Just be careful.

291
00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:11,150
Someone is acting.

292
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:12,429
After checking the answers,

293
00:24:12,429 --> 00:24:14,450
she will act like she's really worried.

294
00:24:14,450 --> 00:24:15,950
When the results come out,

295
00:24:15,950 --> 00:24:17,430
she does better than anyone else.

296
00:24:17,430 --> 00:24:18,649
Yeah.

297
00:24:18,649 --> 00:24:19,910
Someone

298
00:24:19,910 --> 00:24:21,290
is always trying to pretend.

299
00:24:21,290 --> 00:24:22,549
Lin Yujing,

300
00:24:22,549 --> 00:24:24,549
why are you always targeting me?

301
00:24:24,549 --> 00:24:25,769
I didn't say it was you.

302
00:24:26,289 --> 00:24:27,849
Stop arguing.

303
00:24:42,930 --> 00:24:43,990
Just ignore them.

304
00:24:43,990 --> 00:24:45,329
They were just looking for trouble.

305
00:24:48,210 --> 00:24:51,296
This is my first test
since I was transferred here.

306
00:24:52,450 --> 00:24:54,250
I wanted to get good results

307
00:24:54,250 --> 00:24:56,050
to make my parents happy.

308
00:24:56,050 --> 00:24:58,550
They spent so much effort

309
00:24:58,550 --> 00:25:00,210
to get me to study here,

310
00:25:02,049 --> 00:25:03,970
but I let them down.

311
00:25:05,210 --> 00:25:07,470
It takes time to adjust to a new class.

312
00:25:07,470 --> 00:25:08,929
They'll understand.

313
00:25:08,929 --> 00:25:10,249
You can do it well next time.

314
00:25:11,450 --> 00:25:12,670
I heard the scores are out.

315
00:25:12,670 --> 00:25:13,790
Let's have a look.

316
00:25:13,790 --> 00:25:15,010
If I do well,

317
00:25:15,010 --> 00:25:16,209
I'll get a scholarship.

318
00:25:16,209 --> 00:25:17,410
Okay, let's go.

319
00:25:26,329 --> 00:25:27,710
Excuse me.

320
00:25:27,710 --> 00:25:28,768
Pardon me.

321
00:25:33,529 --> 00:25:34,816
I'm going to look over there.

322
00:25:50,809 --> 00:25:52,650
Lin Yujing, check it out for me.

323
00:25:53,370 --> 00:25:54,490
Are you blind?

324
00:25:54,490 --> 00:25:55,849
I'm afraid to look.

325
00:25:56,730 --> 00:25:57,824
Unbelievable.

326
00:26:04,769 --> 00:26:05,984
Found it.

327
00:26:05,984 --> 00:26:07,072
How am I ranking?

328
00:26:10,089 --> 00:26:12,009
The third to last…

329
00:26:15,808 --> 00:26:18,330
My shoes!

330
00:26:18,330 --> 00:26:20,170
You check it out yourself.

331
00:26:20,170 --> 00:26:22,816
What's the point? I failed, anyway.

332
00:26:26,272 --> 00:26:28,602
<i>[Wang Yiyang, 298th]</i>

333
00:26:29,210 --> 00:26:31,510

334
00:26:31,510 --> 00:26:32,889
I passed!

335
00:26:32,889 --> 00:26:34,110
I'm in the top 300.

336
00:26:34,110 --> 00:26:35,810
Juan, look.

337
00:26:35,810 --> 00:26:37,090
I'm in the top 300.

338
00:26:37,090 --> 00:26:38,370
Good.

339
00:26:38,370 --> 00:26:41,310
Shen Juan, where is your name?

340
00:26:41,310 --> 00:26:43,289
You can't be worse than Wang Yiyang, right?

341
00:26:46,769 --> 00:26:47,870
Shen Juan.

342
00:26:47,870 --> 00:26:49,890
Shen Juan actually made it
into the top ten of the grade.

343
00:26:49,890 --> 00:26:50,990
I can't believe it.

344
00:26:50,990 --> 00:26:52,370
He's actually ranked third.

345
00:26:52,370 --> 00:26:53,789
Oh, my God.

346
00:26:53,789 --> 00:26:55,450
702 points.

347
00:26:55,450 --> 00:26:56,830
Is he a school bully?

348
00:26:56,830 --> 00:26:58,250
Clearly, he's a top student.

349
00:26:58,250 --> 00:26:59,328
Exactly.

350
00:27:01,569 --> 00:27:02,970
I'm surprised.

352
00:27:07,090 --> 00:27:09,529
<i>It was okay.</i>

353

<i>Can you understand this formula?</i>

354
00:27:14,170 --> 00:27:16,329
<i>Shen Juan, which formula should you use here?</i>

355
00:27:19,410 --> 00:27:21,809
<i>Output power equals total P minus internal P,

356
00:27:22,489 --> 00:27:24,210
<i>Actually, my physics is not bad.</i>

357
00:28:00,529 --> 00:28:01,610
Shen Juan,

358
00:28:02,170 --> 00:28:03,610
is this just okay?

359
00:28:05,289 --> 00:28:06,329
It is just okay.

360
00:28:15,529 --> 00:28:16,870
I didn't lie to you.

361
00:28:16,870 --> 00:28:18,010
No, you didn't.

362
00:28:18,010 --> 00:28:19,370
I made a mistake.

363
00:28:20,928 --> 00:28:22,130
Are you angry?

364
00:28:22,809 --> 00:28:23,870
I'm not.

365
00:28:23,870 --> 00:28:25,170
Why should I?

366
00:28:25,730 --> 00:28:27,430
I should be happy.

367
00:28:27,430 --> 00:28:29,310
I have strong professional skills,

368
00:28:29,310 --> 00:28:31,392
so you got a full score in physics.

369
00:28:31,392 --> 00:28:33,216
You even scored two points higher than me.

370
00:28:40,569 --> 00:28:42,230
All of you did pretty well

371
00:28:42,230 --> 00:28:43,450
in this monthly test,

372
00:28:44,009 --> 00:28:47,450
especially Shen Juan and Lin Yujing.

373
00:28:48,170 --> 00:28:51,089
Both of them made it
into the top ten of the grade.

374
00:28:51,089 --> 00:28:53,450
Let's give them a round of applause.

375
00:28:59,210 --> 00:29:00,370
Shen Juan surprised me.

376
00:29:01,009 --> 00:29:02,730
I really didn't expect

377
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:04,669
he did so well.

378
00:29:04,669 --> 00:29:06,769
Is this the Shen Juan I knew before?

379
00:29:10,009 --> 00:29:11,169
Before the monthly test,

380
00:29:11,169 --> 00:29:12,830
I asked Lin Yujing

381
00:29:12,830 --> 00:29:14,890
to help Shen Juan improve together.

382
00:29:15,650 --> 00:29:16,650
Look at her.

383
00:29:17,370 --> 00:29:19,289
She is the role model of a good student.

384
00:29:20,849 --> 00:29:22,049
She did pretty well.

385
00:29:22,650 --> 00:29:25,210
She also helped her deskmate do even better.

386
00:29:26,289 --> 00:29:28,529
Everyone should learn from her, okay?

387
00:29:29,529 --> 00:29:31,769
Okay, let's start the class now.

388
00:29:32,769 --> 00:29:35,730
Turn your book to page 54.

389
00:29:38,450 --> 00:29:42,510
- Three, four, five, six.
- Lower your butt.

390
00:29:42,510 --> 00:29:45,489
- Six.
- It's not right.

391
00:29:47,529 --> 00:29:48,650
Make your movements standard.

392
00:29:48,650 --> 00:29:50,049
Or, your partner will flick your forehead.

393
00:29:50,592 --> 00:29:51,650
Did you hear that?

394
00:29:51,650 --> 00:29:53,089
If you do it wrong, I can flick your forehead.

395
00:29:58,049 --> 00:29:59,049
How many did I just do?

396
00:29:59,049 --> 00:30:00,070
Six.

397
00:30:00,070 --> 00:30:01,710
What? I've done over a dozen already.

398
00:30:01,710 --> 00:30:03,669
Well, you did it wrong.

399
00:30:03,669 --> 00:30:05,130
And you can't talk when doing it.

400
00:30:05,930 --> 00:30:07,008
Go on.

401
00:30:10,930 --> 00:30:15,070
Seven, eight, nine, ten.

402
00:30:15,070 --> 00:30:19,328
Ten.

403
00:30:19,328 --> 00:30:20,800
Eleven.

404
00:30:21,650 --> 00:30:22,849
It's been a minute. Get up.

405
00:30:25,489 --> 00:30:26,624
I'm exhausted.

406
00:30:41,930 --> 00:30:44,289
Do you think Juan can calm Lin Yujing's anger?

407
00:30:45,009 --> 00:30:46,730
Juan has never done that.

408
00:30:47,296 --> 00:30:48,352
Is that so?

409
00:30:57,049 --> 00:30:58,144
Where is Lin Yujing?

410
00:30:59,049 --> 00:31:00,672
Why doesn't she come to tutor you?

411
00:31:03,450 --> 00:31:04,529
I'm sorry.

412
00:31:05,089 --> 00:31:07,529
So your deskmate has not forgiven you yet?

413
00:31:08,370 --> 00:31:10,784
I heard she even flicked your forehead.

414
00:31:24,410 --> 00:31:25,809
Don't you think Juan has changed?

415
00:31:26,610 --> 00:31:28,210
In the past, nobody could touch him,

416
00:31:28,210 --> 00:31:29,810
let alone flicking his forehead.

417
00:31:29,810 --> 00:31:30,816
He has changed

418
00:31:30,816 --> 00:31:32,690
since Lin Yujing showed up.

419
00:31:33,809 --> 00:31:34,970
Haven't you changed too?

420
00:31:34,970 --> 00:31:36,390
You even passed physics.

421
00:31:36,390 --> 00:31:37,568
Please.

422
00:31:37,568 --> 00:31:39,328
I did it for my shoes.

423
00:31:41,210 --> 00:31:43,104
Juan start to have human touch.

424
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:44,670
What do you mean?

425
00:31:44,670 --> 00:31:46,249
Are you saying he wasn't a human?

426
00:31:47,370 --> 00:31:48,910
Juan used to be used to being alone.

427
00:31:48,910 --> 00:31:50,496
It's better that someone can bother him.

428
00:31:51,089 --> 00:31:52,608
Aren't we with him?

429
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:55,584
You can't get it.

430
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:12,736
Lin Yujing.

431
00:32:13,489 --> 00:32:14,560
Yes?

432
00:32:15,744 --> 00:32:16,768
I'm sorry.

433
00:32:18,489 --> 00:32:20,009
Why are you suddenly apologizing to me?

434
00:32:21,049 --> 00:32:22,464
Aren't you mad at me?

435
00:32:22,464 --> 00:32:23,744
You even flicked my forehead.

436
00:32:25,769 --> 00:32:28,032
Do you know why I was angry?

437
00:32:29,210 --> 00:32:30,592
How would I know?

438
00:32:31,410 --> 00:32:33,440
Could it be because I scored two points higher
than you in physics?

439
00:32:35,289 --> 00:32:36,384
Because

440
00:32:37,610 --> 00:32:38,784
you're stupid.

441
00:32:43,489 --> 00:32:45,770
Juan.

442
00:32:45,770 --> 00:32:48,570
Mr. Wang said
only you answered this question correctly.

443
00:32:48,570 --> 00:32:51,170
So, I want to ask you about it.

444
00:32:52,410 --> 00:32:53,504
Show it to me.

445
00:32:59,049 --> 00:33:00,630
if it's a circuit,

446
00:33:00,630 --> 00:33:01,920
the potential difference at the two ends

447
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:04,450
is equal to the algebraic sum
of all the sources in the circuit,

448
00:33:04,450 --> 00:33:07,730
the potential on the resistance,
and the voltage drop.

449
00:33:07,730 --> 00:33:10,370
Therefore, the change in potential is negative,

450
00:33:10,890 --> 00:33:12,289
and the current is also negative.

451
00:33:16,210 --> 00:33:17,408
Thank you, Juan.

452
00:33:20,690 --> 00:33:23,089
I didn't expect Juan to be so patient.

453
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:27,089
You all misunderstood him before.

454
00:33:28,329 --> 00:33:30,130
Haven't you spread his rumors before?

455
00:33:34,130 --> 00:33:35,630
Lin Yujing, Shen Juan.

456
00:33:35,630 --> 00:33:37,370
Liu wants to see you two in the office.

457
00:33:40,930 --> 00:33:44,000
You two did well in the monthly exam.

458
00:33:45,410 --> 00:33:47,168
According to the school's tradition,

459
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:50,016
you can apply for a scholarship.

460
00:33:51,249 --> 00:33:53,450
However, starting this year,

461
00:33:53,450 --> 00:33:55,136
there is only one spot per class.

462
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:00,416
How about this?

463
00:34:00,929 --> 00:34:02,880
You two submit an application,

464
00:34:03,969 --> 00:34:05,870
and the school will consider

465
00:34:05,870 --> 00:34:06,944
other factors.

466
00:34:06,944 --> 00:34:08,128
Let the school decide.

467
00:34:08,849 --> 00:34:12,128
Don't be upset if one of you fail, okay?

468
00:34:13,409 --> 00:34:14,689
Okay, you may leave.

469
00:34:14,689 --> 00:34:16,130
Thank you.

470
00:34:30,329 --> 00:34:32,650
Shen Juan, can I discuss something with you?

471
00:34:34,010 --> 00:34:35,089
What is it?

472
00:34:35,089 --> 00:34:37,830
If you don't need the scholarship,

473
00:34:37,830 --> 00:34:39,289
could you let me apply for it?

474
00:34:39,289 --> 00:34:40,710
How do you know I'm not applying?

475
00:34:40,710 --> 00:34:42,290
I can't throw away

476
00:34:42,290 --> 00:34:43,744
such a good opportunity.

477
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,376
You…

478
00:34:52,289 --> 00:34:54,050
To be honest,

479
00:34:55,369 --> 00:34:57,670
I'm from Lianhua Village,

480
00:34:57,670 --> 00:34:59,389
a very poor place.

481
00:34:59,389 --> 00:35:01,130
I don't know if you've heard of it.

482
00:35:01,730 --> 00:35:04,409
We live on raising pigs.

483
00:35:04,929 --> 00:35:07,730
It's hard for my family
to let me study in the city.

484
00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:09,650
And I've never received a scholarship before.

485
00:35:10,329 --> 00:35:11,809
I haven't told you before.

486
00:35:12,650 --> 00:35:15,010
My real name is actually Lin Cuihua.

487
00:35:25,010 --> 00:35:26,490
When I get the scholarship,

488
00:35:27,929 --> 00:35:30,270
I will show it to you, Lin Cuihua.

489
00:35:30,270 --> 00:35:31,750
Don't you have any sympathy?

490
00:35:31,750 --> 00:35:33,230
How do I not have sympathy?

491
00:35:33,230 --> 00:35:34,970
And I realize why you look so familiar.

492
00:35:34,970 --> 00:35:36,000
What's wrong?

493
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,490
How long have you lived in Lianhua Village?

494
00:35:38,336 --> 00:35:39,424
Do you remember

495
00:35:39,424 --> 00:35:41,530
the Heye Village next to your village?

496
00:35:42,090 --> 00:35:43,170
You must know it.

497
00:35:44,010 --> 00:35:45,170
Maybe you've even seen me.

498
00:35:45,889 --> 00:35:47,289
In my village,

499
00:35:47,289 --> 00:35:48,490
we have to raise pigs.

500
00:35:48,490 --> 00:35:49,730
We also have to farm.

501
00:35:50,289 --> 00:35:51,424
Shen Juan is not my real name.

502
00:35:53,010 --> 00:35:54,210
My real name is

503
00:35:56,809 --> 00:35:57,824
Shen Tiezhu.

504
00:36:14,969 --> 00:36:17,289
Still mad, Lin Cuihua?

505
00:36:19,210 --> 00:36:21,024
How about you hit me to vent your anger?

506
00:36:28,992 --> 00:36:30,304
Lin Yujing.

507
00:37:08,409 --> 00:37:09,770
How come you're here?

508
00:37:09,770 --> 00:37:11,050
Can I not be here?

509
00:37:15,730 --> 00:37:16,730
Long time no see.

510
00:37:16,730 --> 00:37:17,769
I've missed you.

511
00:37:18,329 --> 00:37:20,510
Lin Yujing, I can't believe you.

512
00:37:20,510 --> 00:37:22,470
You came to Pucheng without telling me.

513
00:37:22,470 --> 00:37:23,590
I just got here.

514
00:37:23,590 --> 00:37:25,210
I was going to tell you after a while.

515
00:37:25,210 --> 00:37:26,650
If you consider me a friend,

516
00:37:26,650 --> 00:37:28,150
you should have let me welcome you,

517
00:37:28,150 --> 00:37:29,610
not bumping into each other on the street.

518
00:37:29,610 --> 00:37:31,050
I'm sorry, Yao.

519
00:37:31,050 --> 00:37:32,130
That's more like it.

520
00:37:34,409 --> 00:37:35,530
This is my friend, Lu Yao.

521
00:37:36,512 --> 00:37:37,929
This is my deskmate, Shen Juan.

522
00:37:39,289 --> 00:37:41,050
Hello, I'm Lu Yao.

523
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:46,336
Hi.

524
00:37:46,849 --> 00:37:47,872
I have a question.

525
00:37:48,610 --> 00:37:50,112
What's your question?

526
00:37:52,329 --> 00:37:55,210
Did you two do calisthenics just now?

527
00:37:57,610 --> 00:37:59,410
He is quite humorous.

528
00:37:59,410 --> 00:38:01,289
Alright, let's find a place.

529
00:38:01,289 --> 00:38:02,570
I have a lot of catching up to do.

530
00:38:03,130 --> 00:38:05,010
By the way, do you want to join us?

531
00:38:07,490 --> 00:38:08,569
I won't go.

532
00:38:08,569 --> 00:38:11,149
Fine, I'll teach you the calisthenics
another day.

533
00:38:11,149 --> 00:38:12,809
Come on. I have a lot to tell you.

534
00:38:24,889 --> 00:38:27,296
Why do you still like biting straws
like before?

535
00:38:28,050 --> 00:38:29,889
Why do you still like to interfere
like before?

536
00:38:31,210 --> 00:38:33,024
Because you're Lin Yujing.

537
00:38:35,530 --> 00:38:37,696
Have you adapted to Pucheng?

538
00:38:38,208 --> 00:38:39,249
Are there any difficulties?

539
00:38:40,530 --> 00:38:41,670
Not really.

540
00:38:41,670 --> 00:38:43,350
Meng Weiguo is a bit strict.

541
00:38:43,350 --> 00:38:45,930
He put money into my meal card and bus card.

542
00:38:45,930 --> 00:38:47,809
I have to apply if I want to spend money.

543
00:38:48,690 --> 00:38:50,389
Your dad hasn't changed

544
00:38:50,389 --> 00:38:51,409
at all.

545
00:38:52,170 --> 00:38:54,432
If he could change, he wouldn't be Meng Weiguo.

546
00:38:57,184 --> 00:38:58,310
What about you?

547
00:38:58,310 --> 00:39:00,049
Why did you suddenly come to our school?

548
00:39:00,049 --> 00:39:01,650
Don't tell me you came to see me.

549
00:39:03,170 --> 00:39:06,010
Our schools are going to hold a sports event?

550
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:07,270
I came to check out the venue.

551
00:39:07,270 --> 00:39:09,536
I didn't expect I could meet you here.

552
00:39:10,809 --> 00:39:11,930
When you asked me

553
00:39:11,930 --> 00:39:14,510
where you could fix the fountain pen,

554
00:39:14,510 --> 00:39:15,552
were you already here?

555
00:39:15,552 --> 00:39:16,704
How could you not tell me?

556
00:39:17,289 --> 00:39:19,510
I didn't plan to live in Pucheng back then,

557
00:39:19,510 --> 00:39:20,889
so I didn't tell you.

558
00:39:24,730 --> 00:39:27,488
Has your family given you a hard time?

559
00:39:29,610 --> 00:39:30,912
Who dares to do that to me?

560
00:39:32,730 --> 00:39:34,710
You're right. If it happens,

561
00:39:34,710 --> 00:39:36,109
you'll teach them a lesson.

562
00:39:36,109 --> 00:39:37,449
Nobody dares to provoke you.

563
00:39:38,769 --> 00:39:41,190
I feel uncomfortable living with them.

564
00:39:41,190 --> 00:39:43,010
I have to move to the dormitory
as soon as possible.

565
00:39:44,050 --> 00:39:45,344
Will your dad agree?

566
00:39:46,210 --> 00:39:47,264
Of course not.

567
00:39:47,264 --> 00:39:48,736
So, I'm saving money.

568
00:40:03,072 --> 00:40:04,090
Liu.

569
00:40:05,216 --> 00:40:06,336
Lin Yujing.

570
00:40:07,010 --> 00:40:10,210
Your scholarship is approved.

571
00:40:10,210 --> 00:40:11,360
Here.

572
00:40:12,090 --> 00:40:13,472
Sign on it.

573
00:40:14,409 --> 00:40:16,730
Isn't there only one scholarship quota?

574
00:40:16,730 --> 00:40:18,210
How could I have it?

575
00:40:18,889 --> 00:40:20,710
Shen Juan gave it up,

576
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:22,496
so it was given to you.

577
00:40:24,889 --> 00:40:26,289
Sign it.

578
00:40:33,210 --> 00:40:34,809
Here's your scholarship.

579
00:40:41,889 --> 00:40:43,050
Thank you.

580
00:40:44,530 --> 00:40:45,769
Alright, keep it up.

581
00:40:52,650 --> 00:40:54,249
Excuse me, I'm checking in.

582
00:40:55,730 --> 00:40:57,930
Why does everyone procrastinate?

583
00:40:57,930 --> 00:40:59,510
If you don't pay soon, it won't be processed.

584
00:40:59,510 --> 00:41:00,849
I'm paying now.

585
00:41:05,610 --> 00:41:06,752
It's done.

586
00:41:07,488 --> 00:41:08,690
The money is not enough.

587
00:41:09,530 --> 00:41:11,490
Pay the rest in cash.

588
00:41:15,809 --> 00:41:16,809
Where's your application form?

589
00:41:18,050 --> 00:41:19,249
What application form?

590
00:41:21,490 --> 00:41:23,130
Fill out this application form.

591
00:41:23,130 --> 00:41:24,730
Let your parent sign here.

592
00:41:28,170 --> 00:41:29,329
Parent's signature is required?

593
00:41:29,329 --> 00:41:31,330
Without parental consent,
you're not allowed to move in.

594
00:41:31,330 --> 00:41:32,832
You didn't even know this?

595
00:42:18,809 --> 00:42:21,189
<i>I love to see you smile.</i>

596
00:42:21,189 --> 00:42:22,889
<i>It is as bright as the sun.</i>

597
00:42:24,090 --> 00:42:25,270
<i>I'm sorry</i>

598
00:42:25,270 --> 00:42:26,449
<i>for making you upset.</i>

599
00:42:40,282 --> 00:42:44,826
<i>♫ Love sprouts in my palm ♫</i>

600
00:42:46,138 --> 00:42:49,978
<i>♫ Yet worried linger within my eyes ♫</i>

601
00:42:51,770 --> 00:42:56,346
<i>♫ Our story hasn't ended ♫</i>

602
00:42:57,274 --> 00:43:00,954
<i>♫ So where are we now ♫</i>

603
00:43:02,778 --> 00:43:08,442
<i>♫ I want to hug you so badly ♫</i>

604
00:43:08,442 --> 00:43:12,506
<i>♫ I want to become better with you ♫</i>

605
00:43:13,754 --> 00:43:18,618
<i>♫ The youth we shared ♫</i>

606
00:43:18,618 --> 00:43:24,666
<i>♫ Turned into a rainbow within my heart ♫</i>

607
00:43:25,178 --> 00:43:30,746
<i>♫ I really want to warm you ♫</i>

608
00:43:30,746 --> 00:43:32,634
<i>♫ I want to share with you ♫</i>

609
00:43:32,634 --> 00:43:37,306
<i>♫ the beauty of the world ♫</i>

610
00:43:38,190 --> 00:43:40,410
<i>♫ We promised ♫</i>

611
00:43:40,986 --> 00:43:46,682
<i>♫ To never be apart ♫</i>

612
00:43:47,418 --> 00:43:53,120
<i>♫ Do you want to hear me sing ♫</i>

613
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:57,882
<i>♫ The wind chime swaying in my heart ♫</i>

614
00:43:58,426 --> 00:44:02,650
<i>♫ Is a wish ♫</i>

615
00:44:03,386 --> 00:44:09,274
<i>♫ I secretly made for you ♫</i>

616
00:44:09,818 --> 00:44:15,354
<i>♫ I want to plant ♫</i>

617
00:44:15,354 --> 00:44:17,242
<i>♫ a red maple forest ♫</i>

618
00:44:17,242 --> 00:44:21,850
<i>♫ To dye the whole mountain red ♫</i>

619
00:44:22,778 --> 00:44:25,018
<i>♫ The sky after the rain ♫</i>

620
00:44:25,658 --> 00:44:30,586
<i>♫ Was painted by our brilliant dreams ♫</i>

621
00:44:37,466 --> 00:44:42,234
<i>♫ Time is a flower of dream ♫</i>

622
00:44:43,066 --> 00:44:48,152
<i>♫ You've already collected it ♫</i>

623
00:44:49,082 --> 00:44:53,082
<i>♫ When we all become better ♫</i>

624
00:44:54,554 --> 00:44:58,682
<i>♫ We'll see the best of the world together ♫</i>
