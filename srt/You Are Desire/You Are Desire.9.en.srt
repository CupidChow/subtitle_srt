<i>As good as his bond.</i>

35

What do we do now?

36
00:03:02,176 --> 00:03:03,240
Do you have any ideas?

37
00:03:04,599 --> 00:03:06,320
There are three priorities right now.

38
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:08,000
The first is Shen Juan's studies.

39
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,920
I can write down the main focus and test areas

40
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,439
in a way that he can understand easily.

41
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,060
Secondly,

42
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:15,220
he has to take care of his uncle and study.

43
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:16,319
He definitely can't take care of the shop.

44
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:18,520
Someone has to watch
the silver jewelry shop, right?

45
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:20,380
We have to ensure the income of the shop

46
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:21,780
can cover next month's rent.

47
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:23,220
Isn't it just rent?

48
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:24,256
I'll take care of this.

49
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,460
A thief?

50
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:49,600
How would I know?

51
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,120
Be gentle. Do not alert him.

52
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:15,919
What are you doing?

53
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,376
<i>[Qinghe Silverware]</i>
You guys are here.

54
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:40,720
Juan locked himself
in the room making silverware.

55
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,279
Seems like he's in a bad place…

56
00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:44,399
And can't snap out of it.

57
00:04:59,072 --> 00:05:00,800
- Give me the lunch box.
- Okay.

58
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,624
- I'll go in and take a look.
- Okay.

59
00:06:34,586 --> 00:06:41,152
<i>[Eat well.]</i>

60
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:23,040
A famous person once said

61
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:26,540
fragmented time was the golden time
to remember the most things.

62
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:28,279
So you have to make good use of it.

63
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,432
Which famous person said that?

64
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,740
She's right

65
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:33,759
in front of you.

66
00:07:35,648 --> 00:07:36,672
Come on.

67
00:07:40,519 --> 00:07:42,099
These are the notes I took for you.

68
00:07:42,099 --> 00:07:43,880
They're all what the teachers said in class.

69
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,760
I ignored the basics.

70
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,200
These are all key points.

71
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,879
Take a look. If you don't understand, ask me

72
00:07:50,912 --> 00:07:52,720
I promised your uncle

73
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:55,008
to supervise you to study well
and graduate smoothly.

74
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:56,959
You can't let me break my word to him.

75
00:08:00,864 --> 00:08:02,000
The takeaway is here.

76
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,160
Who's going to sign for it?

77
00:08:05,536 --> 00:08:07,040
I'm not late, am I?

78
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,900
Taste it now.

79
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:10,439
See if the food suits your taste.

80
00:08:14,176 --> 00:08:15,328
Aren't you still preparing
for the college entrance examination?

81
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:16,440
You better go back.

82
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:17,799
I've calculated it.

83
00:08:17,799 --> 00:08:19,100
The time from my home to here

84
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:21,040
just can replace my daily endurance training.

85
00:08:22,944 --> 00:08:24,519
Come on. Eat.

86
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:34,279
This is the change of clothes
Wang Yiyang prepared for you.

87
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:36,581
He wants to know

88
00:08:36,581 --> 00:08:37,742
the password on the cell phone left

89
00:08:37,742 --> 00:08:39,642
in the store to contact customers.

90
00:08:40,162 --> 00:08:41,422
They're going to change the remark

91
00:08:41,422 --> 00:08:43,962
to inform customers that our shop only provides
offline and night services for now

92
00:08:43,962 --> 00:08:45,216
and suspend the customization one.

93
00:08:46,561 --> 00:08:47,662
I'll send it to him later.

94
00:08:47,662 --> 00:08:48,704
Okay.

95
00:08:53,481 --> 00:08:54,912
Thank you guys

96
00:08:54,912 --> 00:08:55,961
for thinking so much of me.

97
00:08:57,002 --> 00:08:58,400
You thanked the wrong person.

98
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,832
All of this was arranged by Miss Lin.

99
00:09:04,081 --> 00:09:06,042
Eat now before it gets cold.

100
00:09:06,042 --> 00:09:07,136
Eat.

101
00:09:19,008 --> 00:09:20,128
I'm leaving.

102
00:09:20,128 --> 00:09:21,280
Study hard.

103
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:22,432
Bye.

104
00:09:27,162 --> 00:09:28,762
Look at this after you finish writing.

105
00:09:39,361 --> 00:09:40,622
Why did you bring me here?

106
00:09:40,622 --> 00:09:42,602
Stand over there, and don't move.

107
00:09:42,602 --> 00:09:44,064
You'll know soon.

108
00:09:52,481 --> 00:09:54,021
I heard it from others.

109
00:09:54,021 --> 00:09:55,162
The reason why a wish doesn't come true

110
00:09:55,162 --> 00:09:56,681
may be that you wish too much.

111
00:09:57,242 --> 00:09:58,554
But

112
00:09:58,554 --> 00:10:00,601
this is the first wish
I made with a wish balloon.

113
00:10:01,242 --> 00:10:02,720
So it's bound to come true.

114
00:10:10,561 --> 00:10:11,681
Yes, it will definitely.

115
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:13,952

And then study these well.

00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,002
It's so good.

184
00:19:21,002 --> 00:19:22,080
Look at him.

185
00:19:22,656 --> 00:19:24,022
- So spicy.
- Have some water.

186
00:19:24,022 --> 00:19:25,101
Oh my god, why is it so spicy?

187
00:19:25,101 --> 00:19:26,752
We can't finish all of this.

188
00:19:27,682 --> 00:19:29,312
Lin Yujing, come out for dinner.

189
00:19:30,482 --> 00:19:31,552
Okay.

190
00:19:32,121 --> 00:19:33,722
<i>[I ate the crawfish for you.]</i>

191
00:19:33,722 --> 00:19:34,881
<i>[When can we meet?]</i>

192
00:19:35,802 --> 00:19:36,822
<i>[You decide.]</i>

193
00:19:36,822 --> 00:19:38,601
<i>[Alright then, see you tomorrow.]</i>

194
00:19:47,584 --> 00:19:48,640
Where are we going?

195
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:49,984
You'll know when you follow me.

196
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:05,942
So can you tell me where you're taking me?

197
00:20:05,942 --> 00:20:07,962
When we get there
and get off the bus, you'll know.

198
00:20:21,792 --> 00:20:25,376
<i>♫ When a light comes into my life ♫</i>

199
00:20:25,376 --> 00:20:28,704
<i>♫ That becomes the direction my heart follows ♫</i>

200
00:20:28,704 --> 00:20:32,064
<i>♫ We will have doubts ♫</i>

201
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:35,424
<i>♫ But we still have to set sail ♫</i>

202
00:20:35,424 --> 00:20:38,432
<i>♫ When you sit next to me ♫</i>

203
00:20:38,432 --> 00:20:41,472
<i>♫ Asking me where my home is ♫</i>

204
00:20:42,176 --> 00:20:47,360
<i>♫ I point to a star in the night sky ♫</i>

205
00:20:48,096 --> 00:20:53,504
<i>♫ My home's where it guides ♫</i>

206
00:20:55,722 --> 00:20:56,960
The ocean world.

207
00:20:58,482 --> 00:21:00,262
This is to thank you

208
00:21:00,262 --> 00:21:02,042
for your hard work during this time.

209
00:21:02,682 --> 00:21:04,962
And you promised me.

210
00:21:05,522 --> 00:21:06,624
What did I promise you?

211
00:21:08,121 --> 00:21:09,184
You promised me

212
00:21:09,802 --> 00:21:11,808
that you'd share my joys.

213
00:21:13,361 --> 00:21:16,128
<i>We'll be there</i>

214
00:21:16,128 --> 00:21:18,752
<i>to share your sorrows and joys.</i>

215
00:21:21,522 --> 00:21:23,861
I'll be doing every game today.

216
00:21:23,861 --> 00:21:25,122
No problem.

217
00:21:25,122 --> 00:21:26,912
I've bought the package for you.

218
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:28,768
Let's go.

219
00:21:31,762 --> 00:21:32,896
What do we play first?

220
00:21:44,384 --> 00:21:45,641
Not bad.

221
00:21:50,561 --> 00:21:51,616
Shen Juan.

222
00:21:56,042 --> 00:21:57,162
Shen Tiezhu,

223
00:21:57,162 --> 00:21:58,432
I'll buy you this.

224
00:21:58,432 --> 00:21:59,584
I don't want it.

225
00:21:59,584 --> 00:22:01,184
Everyone is wearing it.

226
00:22:01,792 --> 00:22:03,162
- I won't wear it.
- Yes, you will.

227
00:22:03,162 --> 00:22:04,192
I won't do that.

228
00:22:04,192 --> 00:22:05,504
Why?

229
00:22:07,921 --> 00:22:10,720
Bad guys don't wear this.

230
00:22:13,042 --> 00:22:14,102
Then I'll wear it myself.

231
00:22:14,102 --> 00:22:16,361
Little girl, how do I look?

232
00:22:16,361 --> 00:22:17,881
I'll wear ten if you ask me to.

233
00:22:26,432 --> 00:22:27,520
How much is it?

234
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:28,896
20.

235
00:22:32,576 --> 00:22:33,760
Let's go.

236
00:22:41,641 --> 00:22:42,841
Do I look cute?

237
00:22:44,081 --> 00:22:45,152
Yeah.

238
00:22:45,152 --> 00:22:46,561
Then do you want to be cute like me?

239
00:22:46,561 --> 00:22:47,648
Yeah.

240
00:22:51,641 --> 00:22:53,056
I can't wear it.

241
00:22:53,056 --> 00:22:54,368
You help me wear it.

242
00:25:07,881 --> 00:25:09,472
Aren't you not afraid?

243
00:25:10,682 --> 00:25:12,000
Am I?

244
00:25:18,962 --> 00:25:20,128
Why not play a few more rounds?

245
00:25:21,002 --> 00:25:22,176
Please come again.

246
00:25:22,976 --> 00:25:24,062
Shen Juan,

247
00:25:24,062 --> 00:25:25,536
my name is on that bear.

248
00:25:27,762 --> 00:25:29,361
Little girl, play it?

249
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:30,624
10 yuan for 20 rounds.

250
00:25:30,624 --> 00:25:31,648
How do I get that bear?

251
00:25:31,648 --> 00:25:33,792
Shoot all 20 in the first row.

252
00:25:34,482 --> 00:25:35,582
If you shoot one,

253
00:25:35,582 --> 00:25:36,721
I'll give you a keychain.

254
00:25:36,721 --> 00:25:37,981
If you shoot ten,

255
00:25:37,981 --> 00:25:40,042
I'll give you a pair of couple mugs.
What do you think?

256
00:25:40,042 --> 00:25:41,762
- Here, ten yuan.
- Okay, here you go.

257
00:25:43,648 --> 00:25:44,672
Okay.

258
00:25:45,728 --> 00:25:46,882
I'll try later.

259
00:25:46,882 --> 00:25:48,192
Aim well.

260
00:25:59,522 --> 00:26:01,361
Look at that. It seems hard to hit.

261
00:26:09,641 --> 00:26:11,136
Good. Keep going.

262
00:26:20,202 --> 00:26:21,408
Normal.

263
00:26:29,442 --> 00:26:30,560
Don't laugh.

264
00:26:38,361 --> 00:26:39,641
We're done.

265
00:26:42,682 --> 00:26:43,922
Want that one?

266
00:26:43,922 --> 00:26:45,121
I need to hit all in a row.

267
00:26:48,682 --> 00:26:51,582
Sir, how about this?
You throw 20 balloons at will.

268
00:26:51,582 --> 00:26:52,722
If I hit them all,

269
00:26:52,722 --> 00:26:54,528
the bear is mine.

270
00:26:55,442 --> 00:26:56,576
Throw and hit?

271
00:26:57,161 --> 00:26:59,202
20, you can hit them all?

272
00:26:59,202 --> 00:27:00,480
Here we go again.

273
00:27:01,401 --> 00:27:03,392
Young man, what do you do?

274
00:27:04,522 --> 00:27:06,656
I'm just an ordinary high school student.

275
00:27:07,361 --> 00:27:08,416
Okay.

276
00:27:08,416 --> 00:27:10,176
I'll throw 20 balloons,

277
00:27:10,176 --> 00:27:11,881
and if you can hit them all,

278
00:27:11,881 --> 00:27:13,568
I'll give you the ten yuan back.

279
00:27:14,121 --> 00:27:16,288
See, the treasure of my store.

280
00:27:16,288 --> 00:27:17,440
I'll give it to you for free.

281
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:18,560
How about it?

282
00:27:37,361 --> 00:27:38,560
I'm going to throw it.

283
00:27:39,104 --> 00:27:40,160
Really.

284
00:27:40,704 --> 00:27:41,728
Do it.

285
00:28:01,121 --> 00:28:02,282
Bro,

286
00:28:03,361 --> 00:28:04,682
you must have got buff.

287
00:28:08,641 --> 00:28:10,101
Other people's boyfriends are all wearing it.

288
00:28:10,101 --> 00:28:12,182
If you wear it, you can hit a few more.

289
00:28:12,182 --> 00:28:13,888
If I wear it, I won't look good.

290
00:28:27,904 --> 00:28:29,472
20 shots, all hit.

291
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:33,696
Tell me, young man.

292
00:28:33,696 --> 00:28:36,160
Are you sure
you're just an ordinary high school student?

293
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:37,216
What else?

294
00:28:38,242 --> 00:28:39,842
Sir, you said it.

295
00:28:39,842 --> 00:28:41,501
If all is hit, the ten yuan will be back to us.

296
00:28:41,501 --> 00:28:42,784
Well,

297
00:28:43,328 --> 00:28:44,512
I…

298
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,168
- I'm losing lots of money.
- Everyone is watching

299
00:28:47,712 --> 00:28:49,760
Well, fine.

300
00:29:00,361 --> 00:29:02,302
Sir, I hit one just now too.

301
00:29:02,302 --> 00:29:03,872
Can I get a keychain?

302
00:29:03,872 --> 00:29:06,016
Take it. I'm unlucky today.

303
00:29:10,688 --> 00:29:11,782
Let's leave.

304
00:29:11,782 --> 00:29:12,842
Take care.

305
00:29:12,842 --> 00:29:13,888
I'll play a couple of rounds too.

306
00:29:13,888 --> 00:29:15,182
- So amazing.
- Awesome.

307
00:29:15,182 --> 00:29:16,242
How did you do it?

308
00:29:18,432 --> 00:29:19,462
I'm asking you.

309
00:29:19,462 --> 00:29:20,512
I'll do it.

310
00:30:35,881 --> 00:30:37,216
This is mine.

311
00:30:37,216 --> 00:30:38,880
Didn't you say you gave it to me?

312
00:30:39,682 --> 00:30:41,376
When did I say it?

313
00:30:46,921 --> 00:30:48,064
Then I'll exchange it with you.

314
00:30:54,282 --> 00:30:56,032
- Forget it, if you don't want to.
- I do.

315
00:30:57,024 --> 00:30:58,080
Let's exchange.

316
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:59,232
Your key.

317
00:31:41,002 --> 00:31:42,016
Shen Juan,

318
00:31:43,242 --> 00:31:46,400
what's wrong with the balloons
at the shooting booth today?

319
00:31:50,682 --> 00:31:51,808
Let me tell you.

320
00:31:51,808 --> 00:31:53,504
Owners like him

321
00:31:53,504 --> 00:31:56,422
wouldn't let customers
hit a whole row of balloons.

322
00:31:56,422 --> 00:31:58,502
So he'd put some extra thick balloons

323
00:31:58,502 --> 00:32:00,640
in each row.

324
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:02,016
Ordinary air guns can't pierce them.

325
00:32:02,016 --> 00:32:03,200
You can't either?

326
00:32:05,401 --> 00:32:07,552
Yeah, so I let him throw them one by one.

327
00:32:08,202 --> 00:32:09,984
He'd definitely choose
the lighter ones to throw

328
00:32:09,984 --> 00:32:11,648
because they would float faster.

329
00:32:12,321 --> 00:32:14,144
Wouldn't that be even harder to hit?

330
00:32:18,081 --> 00:32:21,696
I've learned shooting before.

331
00:32:22,242 --> 00:32:25,376
Shooting balloons like them is just basic.

332
00:32:26,442 --> 00:32:27,802
You've learned shooting too?

333
00:32:28,608 --> 00:32:29,920
You know quite a lot.

334
00:32:30,442 --> 00:32:31,488
What else do you know?

335
00:32:38,962 --> 00:32:40,128
A lot more.

336
00:32:41,442 --> 00:32:42,592
You want to know everything?

337
00:32:45,161 --> 00:32:46,722
Who wants to know?

338
00:32:56,161 --> 00:32:57,536
Thank you, Shen Juan.

339
00:32:58,401 --> 00:33:01,242
Actually, I'm really happy today.

340
00:33:07,104 --> 00:33:08,160
Me too.

341
00:33:41,802 --> 00:33:43,168
Where did you go?

342
00:33:44,321 --> 00:33:46,336
The hairy crabs given
by He Songnan's relatives.

343
00:33:52,002 --> 00:33:53,408
Can you hurry up?

344
00:33:54,881 --> 00:33:56,064
I'll pinch you to death later.

345
00:33:56,064 --> 00:33:57,664
Come in, everyone.

346
00:34:13,762 --> 00:34:14,976
Let's eat.

347
00:34:14,976 --> 00:34:16,288
Wait for Juan.

348
00:34:25,602 --> 00:34:27,242
Which girl left this?

349
00:34:31,841 --> 00:34:32,928
No, this isn't right.

350
00:34:33,881 --> 00:34:35,242
Isn't this the key from the store?

351
00:34:36,122 --> 00:34:37,792
It can't be yours, right?

352
00:34:38,521 --> 00:34:39,616
This bunny doll is for little girls.

353
00:34:39,616 --> 00:34:40,642
Why did you buy it?

354
00:34:41,562 --> 00:34:43,584
You should wash your eyes
and wake up your brain.

355
00:34:47,881 --> 00:34:49,024
The ears are quite soft.

356
00:34:52,202 --> 00:34:53,344
Put it down.

357
00:34:54,802 --> 00:34:56,441
Let me tell you, if you get it dirty,

358
00:34:56,441 --> 00:34:57,728
you'll be carried out.

359
00:34:58,401 --> 00:35:00,521
What's the matter? I just took a look.

360
00:35:01,682 --> 00:35:03,122
This is mine.

361
00:35:09,282 --> 00:35:10,304
Let's eat.

362
00:35:11,001 --> 00:35:12,704
Look how big this crab is.

363
00:36:21,361 --> 00:36:22,528
I'm Lin Zhi.

364
00:36:23,321 --> 00:36:24,512
I've arrived in Pucheng.

365
00:36:46,001 --> 00:36:47,202
Everyone, quiet down.

366
00:36:47,202 --> 00:36:48,322
I have two things to say.

367
00:36:48,322 --> 00:36:49,401
One is

368
00:36:49,401 --> 00:36:53,568
that you'll have half a day off
this Friday afternoon.

369
00:36:55,202 --> 00:36:58,421
Liu!

370
00:36:58,421 --> 00:36:59,862
And the other is

371
00:36:59,862 --> 00:37:02,752
that we'll use this half-day off
to hold a parent-teacher meeting.

372
00:37:05,441 --> 00:37:07,642
Go back and inform your parents.

373
00:37:07,642 --> 00:37:09,120
Friday afternoon.

374
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,202
Concentrate on the class later.

375
00:37:14,082 --> 00:37:16,704
It's better not to have it.

376
00:37:18,001 --> 00:37:19,701
My parents are very busy.

377
00:37:19,701 --> 00:37:21,441
And I have to make an appointment in advance

378
00:37:21,441 --> 00:37:22,862
to get them over for a parent-teacher meeting.

379
00:37:22,862 --> 00:37:24,128
Why don't we switch?

380
00:37:25,602 --> 00:37:26,720
What are you going to do?

381
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:27,776
Is your uncle coming?

382
00:37:29,481 --> 00:37:31,904
It's not good to bother him with such things.

383
00:37:33,696 --> 00:37:34,720
What about you?

384
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:35,904
Call your brother?

385
00:37:37,122 --> 00:37:40,682
I-I'll talk to Liu later.

386
00:37:51,122 --> 00:37:53,600
I can't agree to this request of yours.

387
00:37:54,481 --> 00:37:56,064
According to the school's regulations,

388
00:37:56,802 --> 00:37:58,842
if your parents really can't attend the meeting

389
00:37:58,842 --> 00:38:00,128
because of some reasons,

390
00:38:00,841 --> 00:38:03,616
they should tell me in person.

391
00:38:06,082 --> 00:38:07,904
You just transferred here this year.

392
00:38:08,642 --> 00:38:10,802
I haven't seen your parents yet.

393
00:38:11,321 --> 00:38:13,082
I also want to take this opportunity

394
00:38:13,082 --> 00:38:14,304
to let your parents

395
00:38:14,304 --> 00:38:16,320
know more about your situation at school.

396
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:18,642
My grades are okay.

397
00:38:19,282 --> 00:38:20,802
There's nothing for them to worry about

398
00:38:20,802 --> 00:38:22,562
or get to know.

399
00:38:25,082 --> 00:38:27,921
Lin Yujing, you're not right about that.

400
00:38:28,602 --> 00:38:30,368
We want to communicate

401
00:38:30,368 --> 00:38:32,002
with your parents not only for your learning.

402
00:38:32,002 --> 00:38:35,584
Besides, you always perform well at school.

403
00:38:36,122 --> 00:38:39,072
So your parents will only receive praise.

404
00:38:39,072 --> 00:38:40,480
This is a good thing.

405
00:38:42,528 --> 00:38:43,872
Right, Mr. Wang?

406
00:38:43,872 --> 00:38:44,992
Yes.

407
00:38:45,521 --> 00:38:47,200
I want to meet your parents too.

408
00:39:01,921 --> 00:39:03,840
If you feel it's bad,

409
00:39:04,481 --> 00:39:05,952
I can call your dad.

410
00:39:06,481 --> 00:39:09,082
No need, I'll talk to him myself.

411
00:39:09,082 --> 00:39:10,496
Thank you, Mr. Liu.

412
00:39:26,282 --> 00:39:28,001
Yes, this is Liu Fujiang.

413
00:39:43,968 --> 00:39:46,944
Mingxiu, I have another favor to ask.

414
00:39:46,944 --> 00:39:48,736
<i>Do you want me to act with you again?</i>

415
00:39:49,441 --> 00:39:50,762
You don't have to act this time.

416
00:39:50,762 --> 00:39:52,416
Just show your true feelings.

417
00:39:52,416 --> 00:39:54,562
Come to attend a parent-teacher meeting for me.

418
00:39:54,562 --> 00:39:57,024
Just praise your sister's good character

419
00:39:57,024 --> 00:39:59,392
and accept the school's honor award.

420
00:39:59,392 --> 00:40:00,736
<i>Okay, I can do that.</i>

421
00:40:00,736 --> 00:40:01,824
Thanks.

422
00:40:27,521 --> 00:40:28,832
You're here.

423
00:40:33,401 --> 00:40:34,624
What are you laughing at?

424
00:40:34,624 --> 00:40:36,320
What's wrong? Don't I look like it?

425
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:38,802
Yes, you look like you would in 20 years.

426
00:40:40,242 --> 00:40:41,312
This way, please.

427
00:40:50,162 --> 00:40:51,222
After the meeting,

428
00:40:51,222 --> 00:40:52,704
Liu Fujiang might want to talk to you.

429
00:40:52,704 --> 00:40:54,816
If he mentions Meng Weiguo, don't let it slip.

430
00:40:56,001 --> 00:40:57,522
You sure talk a lot.

431
00:40:57,522 --> 00:41:00,352
I'm just trying to get you
to play my parent well.

432
00:41:03,082 --> 00:41:04,224
Don't worry.

433
00:41:04,224 --> 00:41:06,400
Lin Yujing is doing very well at school.

434
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:07,584
Thank you.

435
00:41:09,082 --> 00:41:10,144
Lin Yujing,

436
00:41:13,401 --> 00:41:15,648
your mom is here

437
00:41:22,961 --> 00:41:24,401
This is

438
00:41:25,481 --> 00:41:26,592
your mom?

439
00:41:35,441 --> 00:41:36,502
Why are you here?

440
00:41:36,502 --> 00:41:37,888
I came to see you.

441
00:41:39,361 --> 00:41:40,864
We're about to start
the parent-teacher meeting.

442
00:41:40,864 --> 00:41:43,712
Your mom is here,
so we were discussing your performance.

443
00:41:47,072 --> 00:41:48,256
Lin Yujing,

444
00:41:48,802 --> 00:41:50,722
didn't you ask me to come
to your parent-teacher meeting?

445
00:41:51,321 --> 00:41:52,640
Who is this?

446
00:41:54,401 --> 00:41:55,520
I'm her brother.

447
00:42:02,242 --> 00:42:03,424
Where's my seat?

448
00:42:05,162 --> 00:42:06,902
The meeting is about to start.

449
00:42:06,902 --> 00:42:08,782
How about you go in first

450
00:42:08,782 --> 00:42:12,576
and talk after the meeting?

451
00:42:22,202 --> 00:42:24,320
<i>Watching the wish balloon
float into the distance,</i>

452
00:42:24,881 --> 00:42:26,922
<i>I silently pray in my heart.</i>

453
00:42:26,922 --> 00:42:28,202
<i>In the future days,</i>

454
00:42:28,202 --> 00:42:31,022
<i>I'll share</i>

455
00:42:31,022 --> 00:42:33,722
<i>your sorrows and joys.</i>

456
00:42:33,722 --> 00:42:36,082
<i>Don't forget our agreement.</i>

457
00:42:48,346 --> 00:42:52,890
<i>♫ Love sprouts in my palm ♫</i>

458
00:42:54,202 --> 00:42:58,042
<i>♫ Yet worried linger within my eyes ♫</i>

459
00:42:59,834 --> 00:43:04,410
<i>♫ Our story hasn't ended ♫</i>

460
00:43:05,338 --> 00:43:09,018
<i>♫ So where are we now ♫</i>

461
00:43:10,842 --> 00:43:16,506
<i>♫ I want to hug you so badly ♫</i>

462
00:43:16,506 --> 00:43:20,570
<i>♫ I want to become better with you ♫</i>

463
00:43:21,818 --> 00:43:26,682
<i>♫ The youth we shared ♫</i>

464
00:43:26,682 --> 00:43:32,730
<i>♫ Turned into a rainbow within my heart ♫</i>

465
00:43:33,242 --> 00:43:38,810
<i>♫ I really want to warm you ♫</i>

466
00:43:38,810 --> 00:43:40,698
<i>♫ I want to share with you ♫</i>

467
00:43:40,698 --> 00:43:45,370
<i>♫ The beauty of the world ♫</i>

468
00:43:46,254 --> 00:43:48,474
<i>♫ We promised ♫</i>

469
00:43:49,050 --> 00:43:54,746
<i>♫ To never be apart ♫</i>

470
00:43:55,482 --> 00:44:01,184
<i>♫ Do you want to hear me sing ♫</i>

471
00:44:01,184 --> 00:44:05,946
<i>♫ The wind chime swaying in my heart ♫</i>

472
00:44:06,490 --> 00:44:10,714
<i>♫ Is a wish ♫</i>

473
00:44:11,450 --> 00:44:17,338
<i>♫ I secretly made for you ♫</i>

474
00:44:17,882 --> 00:44:23,418
<i>♫ I want to plant ♫</i>

475
00:44:23,418 --> 00:44:25,306
<i>♫ A red maple forest ♫</i>

476
00:44:25,306 --> 00:44:29,914
<i>♫ To dye the whole mountain red ♫</i>

477
00:44:30,842 --> 00:44:33,082
<i>♫ The sky after the rain ♫</i>

478
00:44:33,722 --> 00:44:38,650
<i>♫ Was painted by our brilliant dreams ♫</i>

479
00:44:45,530 --> 00:44:50,298
<i>♫ Time is a flower of dream ♫</i>

480
00:44:51,130 --> 00:44:56,216
<i>♫ You've already collected it ♫</i>

481
00:44:57,146 --> 00:45:01,146
<i>♫ When we all become better ♫</i>

482
00:45:02,618 --> 00:45:06,746
<i>♫ We'll see the best of the world together ♫</i>
