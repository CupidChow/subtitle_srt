Hello?

10
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:09,250
Don't scream.

11
00:01:09,410 --> 00:01:11,210
The more you scream,
the more excited I get.

12
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:13,210
Help!

13
00:01:17,289 --> 00:01:17,849
Xiaoyu.

14
00:01:20,689 --> 00:01:21,689
Xiaoyu.

15

Xia.

16
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:27,210
Call the police!

17
00:01:30,049 --> 00:01:30,649
Are you okay?

18
00:01:34,489 --> 00:01:35,089
Don't worry.

19
00:01:35,449 --> 00:01:35,969
I'm here.

20
00:01:38,369 --> 00:01:38,889
Hello.

21
00:01:39,209 --> 00:01:40,409
I'd like to make a police report.

22
00:01:57,009 --> 00:01:57,689
It's dangerous.

23
00:01:57,969 --> 00:02:00,289
Was that the person wanted
by the police?

24
00:02:01,769 --> 00:02:03,129
I heard the broadcasting

25
00:02:03,369 --> 00:02:04,649
saying that there's a criminal
on the run here.

26
00:02:05,129 --> 00:02:06,209
It should be him.

27
00:02:07,809 --> 00:02:09,009
Regarding today,

28
00:02:09,209 --> 00:02:10,329
I'd like to thank you all.

29
00:02:13,049 --> 00:02:14,329
It's fine as long as you're okay.

30
00:02:18,929 --> 00:02:19,929
Are you hungry?

31
00:02:20,609 --> 00:02:21,409
A bit.

32
00:02:23,129 --> 00:02:23,889
Let's eat something?

33
00:02:24,049 --> 00:02:25,009
I want to eat barbeque.

34
00:02:25,089 --> 00:02:25,689
Okay.

35
00:02:31,809 --> 00:02:33,569
Your clayfish is here.

36
00:02:33,848 --> 00:02:34,888
- Clayfish!
- Thank you, madam!

37
00:02:34,934 --> 00:02:35,894
- Here.
- Put it here.

38
00:02:38,326 --> 00:02:39,206
Here.

39
00:02:39,334 --> 00:02:39,854
It's fragrant.

40
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:41,810
Here, Shi Yi. Here you go.

41
00:02:43,177 --> 00:02:43,697
Xiaoyu,

42
00:02:44,086 --> 00:02:45,286
you've scored well.

43
00:02:45,531 --> 00:02:46,207
Look at me.

44
00:02:46,208 --> 00:02:47,568
I didn't even score 450.

45
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:48,890
I'm fine with that.

46
00:02:49,254 --> 00:02:50,694
It's not important.

47
00:02:51,735 --> 00:02:52,375
What's important is,

48
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:53,890
what kind of people
do you want to become?

49
00:02:56,046 --> 00:02:57,126
It makes sense.

50
00:02:58,648 --> 00:03:00,408
But who wants to be like you?

51
00:03:00,489 --> 00:03:02,729
You've taken the exam three times.

52
00:03:04,374 --> 00:03:05,572
You can't say that.

53
00:03:05,573 --> 00:03:06,645
As long as you work hard,

54
00:03:06,646 --> 00:03:08,166
you can take the exam every year.

55
00:03:08,731 --> 00:03:09,251
You...

56
00:03:10,092 --> 00:03:10,372
You...

57
00:03:11,177 --> 00:03:12,097
I don't want.

58
00:03:13,768 --> 00:03:14,568
Why are you looking at me?

59
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:16,050
Peel the prawn.

60
00:03:17,969 --> 00:03:18,929
Here, Shi Yi.

61
00:03:19,291 --> 00:03:20,171
Let me serve you a prawn.

62
00:03:22,409 --> 00:03:23,049
Thank you.

63
00:03:28,007 --> 00:03:28,367
Oh, right.

64
00:03:29,129 --> 00:03:29,329
Here.

65
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:32,770
Let's celebrate Xiaoyu's false alarm.

66
00:03:33,051 --> 00:03:33,491
Let's toast to it.

67
00:03:33,529 --> 00:03:34,809
What's there to celebrate?

68
00:03:35,005 --> 00:03:36,005
I was frightened.

69
00:03:36,418 --> 00:03:37,538
We'll calm you down then.

70
00:03:37,768 --> 00:03:38,288
That's right.

71
00:03:38,291 --> 00:03:38,851
Calm down.

72
00:03:39,243 --> 00:03:39,603
Come on.

73
00:03:39,649 --> 00:03:40,089
Cheers.

74
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:40,370
Come on.

75
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:41,850
Cheers.

76
00:03:52,569 --> 00:03:53,809
It was such a relief.

77
00:03:54,445 --> 00:03:55,605
Xiaoyu is safe now.

78
00:03:56,047 --> 00:03:56,567
Yes.

79
00:03:56,765 --> 00:03:58,085
If something has happened to her,

80
00:03:58,125 --> 00:03:59,245
I'll regret it for sure.

81
00:03:59,453 --> 00:04:00,453
Weren't you together just now?

82
00:04:01,008 --> 00:04:01,488
Yes.

83
00:04:01,531 --> 00:04:02,571
We were together for the whole day,

84
00:04:02,773 --> 00:04:03,686
but I didn't know that

85
00:04:03,687 --> 00:04:04,927
when I went to the toilet,

86
00:04:04,929 --> 00:04:05,729
she suddenly went missing.

87
00:04:05,734 --> 00:04:08,007
If Yang Xin didn't keep pestering me,

88
00:04:08,008 --> 00:04:09,848
I wouldn't have let her leave my sight.

89
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:11,410
Yang Xin?

90
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:13,010
Yes.

91
00:04:13,012 --> 00:04:14,332
He just won't stop causing trouble.

92
00:04:14,335 --> 00:04:15,495
(Could it be that Shi Yi and Yang Xin's)

93

94

(Did I expose myself?)

98
00:04:24,002 --> 00:04:24,882
Don't worry.

99
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:25,730
Yang Xin and I

100
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:26,527
are not having any relationship.

101
00:04:31,768 --> 00:04:33,088
(How did she know)

102
00:04:33,885 --> 00:04:35,045
(what I was thinking?)

103
00:04:36,244 --> 00:04:36,804
Shi Yi!

104
00:04:38,891 --> 00:04:39,451
Tomorrow night,

105
00:04:39,451 --> 00:04:41,051
come to my house
for the Olympics opening ceremony.

106
00:04:42,733 --> 00:04:43,133
Okay.

107
00:04:43,452 --> 00:04:44,132
See you there.

108
00:04:44,852 --> 00:04:45,492
Good night.

109
00:05:06,617 --> 00:05:07,257
Xiaoyu,

110
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:08,886
what's your parents' decision?

111
00:05:08,887 --> 00:05:09,407
Did they agree?

112
00:05:09,649 --> 00:05:09,929
Yes,

113
00:05:10,169 --> 00:05:11,009
they've agreed.

114
00:05:11,329 --> 00:05:12,249
Last night,

115
00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:14,130
I've talked to them.

116
00:05:14,411 --> 00:05:14,971
I told them

117
00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:16,490
that I want to learn
mass communication.

118
00:05:16,771 --> 00:05:18,171
Xicheng University's mass communication

119
00:05:18,212 --> 00:05:19,132
is not bad.

120
00:05:19,329 --> 00:05:20,727
Xicheng University's mass communication

121
00:05:20,728 --> 00:05:21,648
is popular.

122
00:05:22,052 --> 00:05:23,052
You need the tier-one university score.

123
00:05:24,372 --> 00:05:25,452
I've thought about it.

124
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:26,690
By then,

125
00:05:26,853 --> 00:05:28,293
I'd first choose a less popular major

126
00:05:28,407 --> 00:05:29,207
randomly.

127
00:05:29,572 --> 00:05:30,612
Then, I'll work hard

128
00:05:30,693 --> 00:05:31,653
in my first two years

129
00:05:32,251 --> 00:05:34,051
to be the top three
so that I can be transferred.

130
00:05:34,611 --> 00:05:35,571
I want to fight for that.

131
00:05:35,853 --> 00:05:36,093
Yes.

132
00:05:36,372 --> 00:05:37,012
I support you.

133
00:05:37,329 --> 00:05:37,729
Keep it up.

134
00:05:38,091 --> 00:05:38,411
Keep it up.

135
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:39,810
Our campuses

136
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:40,650
are still very near.

137
00:05:42,611 --> 00:05:43,611
Have you filled in your ambition, too?

138
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:44,010
Yes.

139
00:05:45,294 --> 00:05:46,174
Jiangbei University.

140
00:05:47,369 --> 00:05:48,209
Not bad.

141
00:05:48,529 --> 00:05:48,969
Keep it up.

142
00:06:08,369 --> 00:06:09,009
Are you crazy?

143
00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:10,047
Do you want to knock me down?

144
00:06:10,048 --> 00:06:10,928
What are you doing here?

145
00:06:11,213 --> 00:06:11,731
I'm here for Shi Yi.

146
00:06:11,732 --> 00:06:12,252
What?

147
00:06:12,448 --> 00:06:13,648
Shi Yi doesn't want to see you.

148
00:06:13,928 --> 00:06:14,328
Scram!

149
00:06:14,730 --> 00:06:15,690
It's none of your business.

150
00:06:16,011 --> 00:06:16,928
Who are you to her?

151
00:06:16,929 --> 00:06:18,009
Who are you to tell me that?

152
00:06:18,129 --> 00:06:19,409
(If he's still having hope,)

153
00:06:20,166 --> 00:06:21,726
(he'll keep pestering Shi Yi.)

154
00:06:24,007 --> 00:06:25,447
She's my girlfriend.

155
00:06:25,808 --> 00:06:26,408
Do you understand?

156
00:06:27,486 --> 00:06:27,886
Fie!

157
00:06:28,209 --> 00:06:28,969
No one would believe.

158
00:06:29,127 --> 00:06:30,487
When did you start going out?

159
00:06:30,691 --> 00:06:31,531
It's none of your business.

160
00:06:31,734 --> 00:06:32,325
Will you leave?

161
00:06:32,326 --> 00:06:33,006
No!

162
00:06:33,010 --> 00:06:33,850
What can you do to me?

163
00:06:36,652 --> 00:06:37,332
What are you doing?

164
00:06:37,573 --> 00:06:38,173
What are you doing?

165
00:06:45,776 --> 00:06:46,416
Xia He!

166
00:06:46,651 --> 00:06:47,771
You're doing this again!

167
00:06:47,811 --> 00:06:48,371
Let go!

168
00:06:48,412 --> 00:06:49,412
Will you leave Shi Yi alone?

169
00:06:49,451 --> 00:06:50,251
No!

170
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:51,210
I'll never leave her alone!

171
00:06:51,252 --> 00:06:51,932
Just kill me!

172
00:06:52,053 --> 00:06:52,653
Will you leave?

173
00:06:52,694 --> 00:06:53,374
No!

174
00:06:53,687 --> 00:06:54,247
Leave now!

175
00:06:55,806 --> 00:06:56,926
What are they doing?

176
00:06:57,329 --> 00:06:57,849
Xia He,

177
00:06:57,970 --> 00:06:58,730
why is he here?

178
00:06:59,251 --> 00:06:59,731
He's looking for you.

179
00:06:59,732 --> 00:07:00,410
He has bad intentions.

180
00:07:00,411 --> 00:07:01,051
No, Shi Yi.

181
00:07:01,812 --> 00:07:02,732
I'm here to apologise to you.

182
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:03,890
He started it first.

183
00:07:03,891 --> 00:07:04,971
I've even prepared a gift for you.

184
00:07:05,010 --> 00:07:05,770
Pretentious!

185
00:07:06,174 --> 00:07:06,774
Xia He,

186
00:07:06,814 --> 00:07:07,534
calm down.

187
00:07:07,849 --> 00:07:09,089
He's almost out of breath.

188
00:07:09,211 --> 00:07:09,651
Xia He,

189
00:07:09,891 --> 00:07:10,291
let go of him.

190
00:07:10,453 --> 00:07:11,653
Let's see what he wants.

191
00:07:15,568 --> 00:07:16,448
Why is he here again?

192
00:07:17,892 --> 00:07:18,692
What do you want?

193
00:07:19,244 --> 00:07:20,564
We have no grudges.

194
00:07:20,889 --> 00:07:22,169
Why do you hate me so much?

195
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:22,926
I don't understand.

196
00:07:22,927 --> 00:07:23,807
You don't need to understand.

197
00:07:24,130 --> 00:07:25,562
Don't come and look for me anymore

198
00:07:25,563 --> 00:07:26,123
will do.

199
00:07:26,331 --> 00:07:27,011
Yang Xin,

200
00:07:27,369 --> 00:07:28,649
you're annoying.

201
00:07:28,966 --> 00:07:29,566
Shut up!

202
00:07:29,690 --> 00:07:30,490
Shut up!

203
00:07:31,326 --> 00:07:31,886
You saw it.

204
00:07:31,967 --> 00:07:32,887
Others hate you.

205
00:07:33,173 --> 00:07:34,693
You can never see what
you've done to others.

206
00:07:34,891 --> 00:07:35,651
What have I done?

207
00:07:35,969 --> 00:07:37,289
You started it first.

208
00:07:37,326 --> 00:07:38,406
You've embarrassed me in front of

209
00:07:38,408 --> 00:07:38,928
so many people.

210
00:07:39,284 --> 00:07:39,844
Enough!

211
00:07:40,245 --> 00:07:40,765
Leave now!

212
00:07:40,885 --> 00:07:41,365
No!

213
00:07:41,885 --> 00:07:43,165
I want everything to be clear!

214
00:07:43,651 --> 00:07:45,251
I've never been treated this way!

215
00:07:47,449 --> 00:07:48,689
I've fallen in love with you.

216
00:07:49,927 --> 00:07:50,927
You're disgusting.

217
00:07:51,211 --> 00:07:51,451
You...

218
00:07:52,086 --> 00:07:52,726
Shameless.

219
00:07:53,491 --> 00:07:54,651
Your thinking is weird.

220
00:07:54,768 --> 00:07:55,688
It takes a toll on you.

221
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:56,808
Will you leave or not?

222
00:07:59,929 --> 00:08:00,889
Is he really your boyfriend?
