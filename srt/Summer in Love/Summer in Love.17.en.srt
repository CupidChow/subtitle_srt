(I wish to become a doctor.)

5
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:43,440
I've only noticed that

6
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:45,210
you two are a match in heaven.

7
00:01:45,970 --> 00:01:46,530
Thank you

8
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:48,810
for telling me the bad thing
Yang Xin wanted to do.

9
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:50,530
I just don't want

10
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:51,850
him to make the same mistakes.

11
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,800
Why did you ask us out?

12
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:56,850
Don't you remember this place?

13
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:00,560
(The four of us)

14
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:03,450
(were standing before this wish tree.)

15

(I chose Xia He.)

17
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:26,240
Let's go, Xia He.

18
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:30,370
(You know)

19
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,320
(what happened after that.)

20

(The four of us were not happy.)

21
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,080
Thinking of it now,

22
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:44,200
it was a mistake.

23
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,200
Time

24
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,320
was joking with us.

25
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:55,720
(I've finally got it after so many years.)

26

(Yang Xin and I)

(The decision back then)

29
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,960
(has held you back.)

30
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,960
(It's harmed us as well.)

31
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:11,510
Why are you here?

32
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:12,640
What?

33
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:13,160
You can be here

34
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:13,880
while I can't?

35
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:16,440
Didn't you marry Xia He?

36
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:17,990
Didn't you marry Shi Yi?

37
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:18,840
Yet you're here having fun.

38
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:20,270
Stop mentioning her.

39
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:21,030
It's no fun.

40
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:22,920
What?

41
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:24,440
You regret it?

42
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,120
Of course.

43
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:29,150
She and I are not suitable.

44
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:30,070
It's boring.

45
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,830
Didn't you spend money and effort

46
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:34,830
to marry her?

47
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:36,640
You're bored of her so quickly?

48
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:38,670
Aren't you the same?

49
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:41,710
Why did you marry the nerdy Xia He?

50
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:44,350
Do you want to hear the truth?

51
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:47,870
Did you marry Shi Yi's
childhood sweetheart

52
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,760
because I've married her?

53
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:51,360
Thinking of it,

54
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,080
I was really impulsive.

55
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:04,390
I'm sorry.

56
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:09,070
(Not long after that,)

57
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,800
(we met a car accident.)

58
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,960
(Both of us were in a coma.)

59
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:17,210
(I'm not sure if we'd die.)

60
00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:19,750
(When we were unconscious,)

61
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:22,120
(we've both heard a voice,)

62
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:23,430
(asking us)

63
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:26,000
what we'd like to do

64
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,560
if we can go back in time.

65
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,400
I want to come back to this summer

66
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:32,430
because I wish we can do
the right decision.

67
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:33,910
Then

68
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,270
something miraculous happened.

69
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:45,600
(After we woke up from the coma,)

70
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:48,760
(we've come back to 2008.)

71
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,320
I didn't expect

72
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:01,710
Yang Xin and I could come back here

73
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,680
before we died.

74
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:05,070
What about you?

75
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:06,750
What happened?

76
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:37,860

Xia He, what about you?

83
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,040
Hello.

84

You two made a wish here.

96
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:37,240
The wish tree let you both
go back to 2008

97
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,630
and make a new decision,

but

99
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,520
this decision involves the four of us.

100
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,550
Only when Yang Xin and I are back,

101
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:48,870
the ending can be changed.

102
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,590
Although it's unbelievable,

103
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:53,670
it's given us a chance

104
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:55,510
to face ourselves

105
00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:57,190
and changed the history.

106
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,480
We can choose again.
