3
00:00:38,406 --> 00:00:39,126
Sir,

4
00:00:39,155 --> 00:00:40,795
(Zhongjue Luxury Car)
thanks for the ice cream!

5
00:00:40,998 --> 00:00:41,638
Thank you!

6
00:00:42,282 --> 00:00:43,322
It's tasty!

7
00:00:48,045 --> 00:00:49,925
Safe trip, gentlemen!

8
00:00:50,164 --> 00:00:51,164
If there's anything,

9
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:52,200
just contact me any time!

10
00:00:55,289 --> 00:00:55,649
You...

11
00:00:56,121 --> 00:00:56,841
Look at you.

12
00:00:57,410 --> 00:00:58,530
Do you know what it means by

13
00:00:58,965 --> 00:00:59,965
don't look down on a young man?

14
00:01:00,891 --> 00:01:01,972
You're stupid.

15
00:01:02,606 --> 00:01:03,126
I know I was wrong.

16
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:04,010
You sold our client's car

17
00:01:04,293 --> 00:01:05,213
just like that.

18
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:06,330
You must think of a way

19
00:01:07,168 --> 00:01:08,088
to compensate the client.

20
00:01:21,526 --> 00:01:23,446
We can check the score today.

21
00:01:23,566 --> 00:01:24,926
I'm nervous.

22
00:01:25,327 --> 00:01:26,207
Why do you need to be nervous?

23
00:01:26,526 --> 00:01:27,486
Even if you didn't score well,

24
00:01:27,648 --> 00:01:28,968
I'll retake the subjects with you.

25
00:01:29,405 --> 00:01:30,245
Don't simply say that.

26
00:01:30,487 --> 00:01:31,967
How can you retake the subjects?

27
00:01:31,968 --> 00:01:32,768
Also,

28
00:01:32,964 --> 00:01:34,764
your parents will not agree to it.

29
00:01:35,327 --> 00:01:36,567
What's wrong with that?

30
00:01:36,804 --> 00:01:38,404
Even though we're 30 years old,

31
00:01:38,448 --> 00:01:39,848
life can start all over again.

32
00:01:47,206 --> 00:01:48,446
After all, we've graduated.

33
00:01:49,086 --> 00:01:50,286
Why not we get changed?

34
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:50,850
Let's go.

35
00:01:51,201 --> 00:01:51,801
Let's go!

36
00:01:57,241 --> 00:01:58,881
What are you thinking?

37
00:01:59,003 --> 00:02:01,363
Are you worried that
you didn't score well?

38
00:02:01,366 --> 00:02:03,006
(I'm worried about you,)

39
00:02:03,046 --> 00:02:04,046
(silly girl.)

40
00:02:06,087 --> 00:02:08,367
Can you stop going to the school?

41
00:02:08,488 --> 00:02:09,964
I'm becoming a laughing stock.

42
00:02:09,965 --> 00:02:11,005
If you can study well

43
00:02:11,082 --> 00:02:12,042
like Shi Yi,

44
00:02:12,094 --> 00:02:13,414
do I need to be so worried?

45
00:02:13,685 --> 00:02:14,245
Yes,

46
00:02:14,326 --> 00:02:15,006
Xiaoyu.

47
00:02:15,044 --> 00:02:16,962
Your father is studying on

48
00:02:16,963 --> 00:02:18,523
the schools for your ambitions.

49
00:02:20,727 --> 00:02:21,647
Ambitions?

50
00:02:23,891 --> 00:02:24,851
What ambitions?

51
00:02:26,164 --> 00:02:28,084
Shouldn't you ask me about my ambitions?

52
00:02:28,164 --> 00:02:29,244
What do you know?

53
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:31,210
Your mother and I are doing it
for your own good.

54
00:02:31,643 --> 00:02:33,243
Why are you so immature?

55
00:02:40,485 --> 00:02:41,645
I'm going to the tier-one university.

56
00:02:41,649 --> 00:02:43,409
I must tell my parents now.

57
00:02:43,444 --> 00:02:45,204
I didn't score well for
my science subjects.

58
00:02:50,247 --> 00:02:51,567
Xia He?

59
00:02:57,610 --> 00:02:58,930
Are you really sick?

60
00:02:58,965 --> 00:03:00,525
Are you possessed by Yang Xin?

61
00:03:01,929 --> 00:03:02,807
(Oh no.)

62
00:03:02,808 --> 00:03:03,888
(I've messed this up.)

63
00:03:05,566 --> 00:03:07,286
(Shi Yi doesn't like this style.)

64
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:08,967
(I'm stupid.)

65
00:03:09,208 --> 00:03:09,608
Hey.

66
00:03:09,809 --> 00:03:10,449
Shi Yi,

67
00:03:10,645 --> 00:03:11,685
you're too petty.

68
00:03:12,206 --> 00:03:13,846
Xia actually prepared
this surprise for you.

69
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:15,250
He just bought this car.

70
00:03:15,407 --> 00:03:16,167
And these.

71
00:03:16,287 --> 00:03:17,407
He prepared these for you.

72
00:03:17,927 --> 00:03:19,527
- This is the latest...
- Shut up.

73
00:03:20,889 --> 00:03:22,529
(He's being mysterious lately.)

74
00:03:22,889 --> 00:03:24,369
(So, this is what he did.)

75
00:03:26,768 --> 00:03:28,808
What are you two doing?

76
00:03:29,327 --> 00:03:30,167
Let's go, Xiaoyu.

77
00:03:30,565 --> 00:03:31,925
So weird.

78
00:03:34,043 --> 00:03:34,643
Xia,

79
00:03:34,805 --> 00:03:35,925
we must have bought too little.

80
00:03:36,203 --> 00:03:37,243
I shouldn't have listened to you

81
00:03:37,246 --> 00:03:38,726
who have retaken the subjects
for three years.

82
00:03:44,043 --> 00:03:45,403
Is this not surprise?

83
00:03:45,606 --> 00:03:46,726
What's surprise then?

84
00:03:53,046 --> 00:03:54,286
Shi Yi, what's wrong?

85
00:03:54,323 --> 00:03:56,203
Why are you not happy?

86
00:04:02,804 --> 00:04:03,284
Xiaoyu,

87
00:04:03,405 --> 00:04:04,365
go check your scores.

88
00:04:04,487 --> 00:04:05,047
I'll wait for you.

89
00:04:09,007 --> 00:04:10,447
Shi Yi.

90
00:04:15,927 --> 00:04:16,607
I'm sorry.

91
00:04:16,849 --> 00:04:17,969
I've made you misunderstood.

92
00:04:19,363 --> 00:04:20,323
I'm...

93
00:04:21,009 --> 00:04:22,049
Why can't you learn something else?

94
00:04:22,447 --> 00:04:24,007
Why did you learn from Yang Xin?

95
00:04:24,127 --> 00:04:24,847
It's awkward.

96
00:04:26,086 --> 00:04:28,446
I don't like to see Yang Xin disturb you

97
00:04:28,605 --> 00:04:29,365
just because he's rich and he has a car.

98
00:04:30,007 --> 00:04:30,887
I was thinking

99
00:04:31,366 --> 00:04:31,966
I can have

100
00:04:32,566 --> 00:04:33,126
what he has.

101
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:36,010
Then I can be your driver

102
00:04:36,928 --> 00:04:38,248
every day.

103
00:04:39,127 --> 00:04:39,687
Then

104
00:04:40,368 --> 00:04:41,848
he won't disturb you anymore.

105
00:04:42,931 --> 00:04:43,891
I didn't know

106
00:04:44,364 --> 00:04:45,564
you'd dislike this.

107
00:04:47,121 --> 00:04:47,961
I'm sorry.

108
00:04:48,043 --> 00:04:49,083
I was too silly.

109
00:04:49,325 --> 00:04:50,685
Why didn't I think of this?

110
00:04:51,282 --> 00:04:52,762
I didn't think about your feelings.

111
00:04:52,846 --> 00:04:53,926
(He's usually boring.)

112
00:04:54,248 --> 00:04:56,088
(Why is he so honest today?)

113
00:04:57,407 --> 00:04:58,127
I'm sorry.

114
00:04:59,326 --> 00:05:00,606
Why am I so silly?

115
00:05:01,688 --> 00:05:02,688
Xiaoyu!

116
00:05:02,809 --> 00:05:03,489
How did it go?

117
00:05:03,531 --> 00:05:04,371
Is the result out?

118
00:05:04,492 --> 00:05:05,332
Shut up.

119
00:05:06,168 --> 00:05:07,248
What's wrong with her?

120
00:05:09,367 --> 00:05:10,167
Obviously,

121
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:11,730
she didn't score well.

122
00:05:13,408 --> 00:05:14,328
Xiaoyu,

123
00:05:14,529 --> 00:05:16,049
it's just an exam!

124
00:05:16,208 --> 00:05:17,888
Do it again next year!

125
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:20,325
Enough.

126
00:05:21,051 --> 00:05:22,531
You didn't make it for three years.

127
00:05:22,567 --> 00:05:23,447
Why are you so optimistic?

128
00:05:26,528 --> 00:05:27,888
Where are you going?

129
00:05:27,971 --> 00:05:28,891
Xia,

130
00:05:29,088 --> 00:05:30,128
won't you check your score?

131
00:05:36,725 --> 00:05:37,962
Don't worry.

132
00:05:37,963 --> 00:05:40,003
We'll discuss about

133
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:41,566
how to tell your parents.

134
00:05:43,084 --> 00:05:45,044
If I didn't get into
the tier-one university,

135
00:05:45,604 --> 00:05:46,764
they'll scold me.

136
00:05:47,248 --> 00:05:49,608
Now, I didn't even get
any tier-two university.

137
00:05:51,248 --> 00:05:53,168
They must be disappointed.

138
00:05:57,209 --> 00:05:58,089
Don't worry.

139
00:05:58,250 --> 00:05:59,290
I'll stay with you.

140
00:06:00,286 --> 00:06:02,047
Two Global Flavor Buffet.

141
00:06:02,126 --> 00:06:03,606
Two Chocolate Heaven.

142
00:06:03,732 --> 00:06:04,852
Hold on.

143
00:06:04,971 --> 00:06:05,612
Xia,

144
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:07,290
you're ordering so much.
What about the dinner?

145
00:06:07,445 --> 00:06:08,605
What do you know?

146
00:06:09,046 --> 00:06:10,246
When the girls are sad,

147
00:06:10,246 --> 00:06:11,686
they want something sweet.

148
00:06:11,848 --> 00:06:13,288
How did you get to know all these?

149
00:06:13,846 --> 00:06:14,406
Shut up.

150
00:06:15,007 --> 00:06:15,887
Please get them ready.

151
00:06:15,929 --> 00:06:16,609
All right.

152
00:06:17,686 --> 00:06:18,286
Xia,

153
00:06:18,889 --> 00:06:19,649
something is wrong with you.

154
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:20,886
You're talkative.

155
00:06:30,285 --> 00:06:31,845
Where are they?
Why are they taking so long?

156
00:06:36,286 --> 00:06:36,966
Shi Yi.

157
00:06:37,166 --> 00:06:38,406
Did you see Xiaoyu?

158
00:06:38,685 --> 00:06:39,685
Xiaoyu is missing?

159
00:06:39,886 --> 00:06:40,926
Wasn't she with you?

160
00:06:41,805 --> 00:06:42,925
I went to the toilet.

161
00:06:43,086 --> 00:06:44,126
She's gone after I came out.

162
00:06:57,405 --> 00:06:57,845
Let's go.

163
00:06:58,088 --> 00:06:58,768
We'll look for her.

164
00:06:59,089 --> 00:06:59,449
Okay.

165
00:07:03,449 --> 00:07:04,449
What's going on?

166
00:07:20,006 --> 00:07:21,446
(If only Xiaoyu had done better)

167
00:07:21,647 --> 00:07:23,607
(and made it to
the tier-one university.)

168
00:07:25,246 --> 00:07:27,046
(She didn't even get
a tier-two university.)

169
00:07:27,366 --> 00:07:28,966
(What tier-one university?)

170
00:07:31,486 --> 00:07:33,206
(Why did she score so terribly?)

171
00:07:33,726 --> 00:07:35,446
