(I'll Never Let It Happen Again)

3
00:00:45,137 --> 00:00:46,617
Run!

4
00:01:09,455 --> 00:01:10,935
(Around 4 p.m. today,)

5
00:01:10,935 --> 00:01:13,975
(a chemical factory in our city
had a great explosion.)

6
00:01:14,457 --> 00:01:16,617
(The medical team is now
on the way to the rescue.)

7
00:01:16,896 --> 00:01:18,016
(The number of casualty is not clear.)

8
00:01:18,817 --> 00:01:21,537
(Please do not get near to the place.)

9
00:01:24,777 --> 00:01:26,577
Why are you not eating?

10
00:01:26,858 --> 00:01:28,258
Your factory director is not going
to take the responsibility.

11
00:01:28,456 --> 00:01:29,856
You've lost your legs.

12
00:01:29,897 --> 00:01:31,017
Now, you want to bear
the blame for him?

13
00:01:31,215 --> 00:01:32,295
You're responsible.

14
00:01:32,815 --> 00:01:34,575
But what about us?

15
00:01:35,617 --> 00:01:36,017
Mother,

16
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:37,096
you haven't given me

17
00:01:37,096 --> 00:01:37,976
the money for

18
00:01:37,979 --> 00:01:38,659
the summer camp.

19
00:01:38,662 --> 00:01:39,382
I have no money!

20
00:01:40,017 --> 00:01:41,137
Look at your father's legs!

21
00:01:41,339 --> 00:01:42,579
Where do we have money?

22
00:01:44,695 --> 00:01:46,695
Screw it!

23
00:01:50,014 --> 00:01:50,574
Yi,

24
00:01:51,658 --> 00:01:52,738
why not from tomorrow onwards,

25
00:01:52,857 --> 00:01:53,857
you'll go get a job?

26
00:01:53,976 --> 00:01:55,416
Something serious happened at home.

27
00:01:55,538 --> 00:01:56,498
You're the elder sister.

28
00:01:56,534 --> 00:01:57,414
You should take the responsibility.

29
00:02:01,018 --> 00:02:01,538
Yi,

30
00:02:01,936 --> 00:02:03,576
why not you marry to a rich man?

31
00:02:04,174 --> 00:02:05,334
Yang is pursuing you.

32
00:02:06,018 --> 00:02:07,338
I heard that he's rich.

33
00:02:08,214 --> 00:02:08,854
Really?

34
00:02:09,335 --> 00:02:10,095
Yi,

35
00:02:10,257 --> 00:02:11,177
what are you waiting for?

36
00:02:11,214 --> 00:02:12,414
Say yes to him quickly.

37
00:02:12,659 --> 00:02:14,739
He's the son of Yang Group's boss.

38
00:02:15,337 --> 00:02:16,097
If you marry him,

39
00:02:16,212 --> 00:02:17,092
you'll live a good life.

40
00:02:17,179 --> 00:02:18,939
Our problem will be solved.

41
00:02:20,138 --> 00:02:20,578
That's right.

42
00:02:20,774 --> 00:02:21,814
Yi, just marry him.

43
00:02:25,102 --> 00:02:26,622
Are you leaving or not?

44
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:28,620
She's not willing to leave Xia He.

45
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:30,220
I saw him waiting for her downstairs.

46
00:02:30,304 --> 00:02:30,744
Shi Yi!

47
00:02:31,056 --> 00:02:31,576
Shi Yi!

48
00:02:34,858 --> 00:02:35,698
Yi,

49
00:02:35,815 --> 00:02:37,290
consider Yang Xin.

50
00:02:37,291 --> 00:02:39,652
He can help our family.

51
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:20,780
(Yang Xin)

52
00:03:27,015 --> 00:03:29,095
I can never let this

53
00:03:29,136 --> 00:03:30,856
happen again.

54
00:03:33,656 --> 00:03:34,216
Xia He!

55
00:03:35,137 --> 00:03:35,817
Xia He, let go!

56
00:03:35,855 --> 00:03:36,695
We'll both compromise!

57
00:03:36,902 --> 00:03:37,382
Stop fighting!

58
00:03:37,538 --> 00:03:38,218
Stop it!

59
00:03:38,343 --> 00:03:38,823
No way!

60
00:03:39,097 --> 00:03:40,097
I can't let you go now.

61
00:03:40,979 --> 00:03:43,096
I can't let you ruin Shi Yi's effort.

62
00:03:45,139 --> 00:03:46,539
Got it, sir.

63
00:03:54,937 --> 00:03:56,057
Be there right now!

64
00:03:56,133 --> 00:03:57,213
Otherwise, you're fired!

65
00:03:58,215 --> 00:03:58,495
Sir...

66
00:04:16,296 --> 00:04:16,656
Yi,

67
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:18,140
what are you doing here?

68
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:18,700
You

69
00:04:18,819 --> 00:04:19,459
are being careless.

70
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:20,460
I almost knocked you down.

71
00:04:21,098 --> 00:04:21,658
Father,

72
00:04:22,731 --> 00:04:23,571
I'm fine.

73
00:04:24,012 --> 00:04:24,892
Let's go home.

74
00:04:25,016 --> 00:04:25,536
No.

75
00:04:25,657 --> 00:04:26,616
I need to handle something urgent.

76
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:27,419
Go home first.

77
00:04:28,019 --> 00:04:29,659
Your director is getting you there
to take the blame.

78
00:04:29,698 --> 00:04:30,578
Don't go.

79
00:04:31,898 --> 00:04:32,778
What are you talking about?

80
00:04:33,177 --> 00:04:34,737
What have I been teaching you?

81
00:04:35,222 --> 00:04:35,982
We

82
00:04:36,097 --> 00:04:37,537
need to be responsible.

83
00:04:37,538 --> 00:04:38,658
We can't run away.

84
00:04:38,702 --> 00:04:40,302
Father, don't go.

85
00:04:40,413 --> 00:04:42,133
There will be a second explosion.

86
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:42,460
Enough!

87
00:04:43,217 --> 00:04:43,896
If you keep being unreasonable,

88
00:04:43,935 --> 00:04:44,655
I'll be angry!

89
00:04:45,094 --> 00:04:45,934
Father, I beg you.

90
00:04:45,977 --> 00:04:47,057
Don't go.

91
00:04:47,261 --> 00:04:48,181
Don't go.

92
00:04:48,536 --> 00:04:50,496
I don't want my father

93
00:04:50,537 --> 00:04:52,657
to live in pain for
the rest of his life.

94
00:04:52,694 --> 00:04:53,814
Father.

95
00:04:54,055 --> 00:04:55,370
Father, I beg you.

96
00:04:55,371 --> 00:04:56,691
Don't go.

97
00:04:57,375 --> 00:04:58,015
Okay.

98
00:04:58,176 --> 00:04:59,736
You're in your puberty.

99
00:05:00,455 --> 00:05:01,735
You're emotional.

100
00:05:01,931 --> 00:05:03,131
I can understand.

101
00:05:03,617 --> 00:05:04,053
However,

102
00:05:04,054 --> 00:05:05,534
you need to understand my situation.

103
00:05:06,211 --> 00:05:06,891
Now,

104
00:05:06,898 --> 00:05:08,698
something happened to my factory.

105
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:10,180
I need to be there urgently.

106
00:05:10,375 --> 00:05:12,135
Many things need to be handled there.

107
00:05:12,616 --> 00:05:14,736
If I don't go because
I'm scared of the danger,

108
00:05:15,104 --> 00:05:17,184
I'm running away from
the responsibility.

109
00:05:17,774 --> 00:05:18,254
In the future,

110
00:05:18,653 --> 00:05:20,173
not only will I be punished,

111
00:05:20,571 --> 00:05:22,251
I'll feel guilty as well.

112
00:05:23,378 --> 00:05:24,178
Do you understand?

113
00:05:25,936 --> 00:05:26,296
Be nice.

114
00:05:26,377 --> 00:05:26,937
Listen to me.

115
00:05:26,975 --> 00:05:27,495
Go home.

116
00:05:28,096 --> 00:05:28,616
Hurry.

117
00:05:34,378 --> 00:05:35,658
Why did you come in?

118
00:05:39,098 --> 00:05:40,818
Why won't you listen to me?

119
00:05:45,976 --> 00:05:47,936
I don't know
what's going on in the factory.

120
00:05:47,937 --> 00:05:49,736
Just stay in the car later.

121
00:05:54,339 --> 00:05:54,779
Oh, right.

122
00:05:55,261 --> 00:05:56,141
How was the exam?

123
00:05:57,499 --> 00:05:58,379
It's great.

124
00:05:58,980 --> 00:05:59,540
Really?

125
00:06:01,096 --> 00:06:02,216
Great.

126
00:06:02,979 --> 00:06:03,619
I

127
00:06:03,658 --> 00:06:05,178
was planning to pick you up,

128
00:06:05,255 --> 00:06:06,655
but this happened.

129
00:06:07,177 --> 00:06:08,017
No worries, father.

130
00:06:08,257 --> 00:06:09,056
Drive slowly.

131
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:10,620
Okay.

132
00:06:12,975 --> 00:06:13,535
Well,

133
00:06:13,897 --> 00:06:15,217
since you did well,

134
00:06:15,494 --> 00:06:15,974
tell me

135
00:06:16,061 --> 00:06:16,941
what you want as a reward.

136
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:19,818
I want nothing.

137
00:06:19,976 --> 00:06:21,376
I want you to be well.

138
00:06:21,976 --> 00:06:23,096
What are you talking about?

139
00:06:23,339 --> 00:06:24,499
I've been well.

140
00:06:26,339 --> 00:06:27,654
I'm talking about you.

141
00:06:27,655 --> 00:06:30,935
Think about what you want.

142
00:06:31,851 --> 00:06:34,131
(I want you to survive this accident.)

143
00:06:37,935 --> 00:06:38,935
I know.

144
00:06:39,376 --> 00:06:40,296
All these years,

145
00:06:40,653 --> 00:06:41,733
you've been treated poorly

146
00:06:41,895 --> 00:06:43,495
in the family.

147
00:06:43,935 --> 00:06:45,095
Your mother

148
00:06:45,654 --> 00:06:46,934
loves your brother too much.

149
00:06:47,575 --> 00:06:48,695
She'd only think about him

150
00:06:48,735 --> 00:06:50,055
whenever there's

151
00:06:50,895 --> 00:06:52,255
something nice.

152
00:06:52,816 --> 00:06:53,576
As for me,

153
00:06:54,496 --> 00:06:55,936
I'm busy with work in the factory.

154
00:06:56,535 --> 00:06:57,895
I didn't show you enough concern.

155
00:06:59,415 --> 00:07:00,693
Don't blame me.

156
00:07:00,694 --> 00:07:01,694
Okay?

157
00:07:03,534 --> 00:07:04,454
I've decided.

158
00:07:05,095 --> 00:07:06,655
I need to work harder

159
00:07:07,455 --> 00:07:08,535
and longer

160
00:07:09,697 --> 00:07:10,377
so that

161
00:07:11,693 --> 00:07:13,413
I can prepare well for you.

162
00:07:13,932 --> 00:07:14,852
No matter what

163
00:07:16,538 --> 00:07:17,738
you want to do in the future,

164
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:20,220
I'll fully support you,

165
00:07:20,776 --> 00:07:21,336
okay?

166
00:07:29,659 --> 00:07:30,379
Father.

167
00:07:31,854 --> 00:07:33,334
Let me tell you a secret.

168
00:07:33,413 --> 00:07:34,133
Sure.

169
00:07:36,734 --> 00:07:37,174
Father,

170
00:07:38,539 --> 00:07:39,339
I love you.

171
00:07:40,898 --> 00:07:42,258
I regret that

172
00:07:42,496 --> 00:07:44,416
I didn't say it before.

173
00:07:47,694 --> 00:07:48,574
Good girl.

174
00:07:49,659 --> 00:07:50,699
You're mature.
