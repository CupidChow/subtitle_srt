special existence.

174
00:07:06,587 --> 00:07:07,507
I

175
00:07:07,987 --> 00:07:09,427
have made up the most regretful thing
ever happened.

176
00:07:09,787 --> 00:07:11,227
I just want to be myself happily.

177
00:07:11,827 --> 00:07:12,507
Be yourself.

Me!

you were right.

183

The one who lights up
the Olympic flame

184
00:07:26,066 --> 00:07:27,666
is Li Ning.

185

Yes, Xia He.

186

How did you guess it right?

187

This is live.

188
00:07:32,587 --> 00:07:33,267
I...

189
00:07:33,267 --> 00:07:35,987
I saw someone predicted it online.

190
00:07:36,346 --> 00:07:37,066
Who is that?

191
00:07:38,187 --> 00:07:39,347
The person is called

192
00:07:39,467 --> 00:07:40,427
Wang Haohao.

193
00:07:47,067 --> 00:07:48,307
Here. Let's eat chicken.

194
00:07:49,226 --> 00:07:50,666
We'll watch Olympic tomorrow.

195
00:07:50,706 --> 00:07:52,146
- Okay.
- Come on.

196
00:07:52,266 --> 00:07:53,786
Come on.

197
00:07:57,540 --> 00:07:59,460
Madam, your chicken is tasty.

198
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:01,340
Eat more.

I've decided to go
to the same university as you.

Why not we get them up here?

It's not good to do that there.
