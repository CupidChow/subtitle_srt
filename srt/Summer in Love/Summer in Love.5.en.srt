(She dare not go home)

177
00:08:01,324 --> 00:08:02,804
(because she was afraid.)

178
00:08:03,404 --> 00:08:05,004
(When she was lingering outside,)

179
00:08:05,607 --> 00:08:07,767
(she was harmed.)

180
00:08:19,485 --> 00:08:20,245
Shi Yi.

181
00:08:20,887 --> 00:08:21,247
You...

182
00:08:22,008 --> 00:08:22,408
You...

183
00:08:23,042 --> 00:08:23,962
What's wrong?

184
00:08:32,365 --> 00:08:33,405
It's only been two days.

185
00:08:33,482 --> 00:08:34,442
Do you miss me that much?

186
00:08:37,004 --> 00:08:37,364
Let's go.

187
00:08:37,406 --> 00:08:38,246
Let's talk inside.

188
00:08:45,083 --> 00:08:45,603
Move aside.

189
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,160
Enough.

190
00:08:48,244 --> 00:08:48,924
Enough.

191
00:08:49,326 --> 00:08:50,126
Stop beating me.

192
00:08:50,806 --> 00:08:52,246
Don't use any weapon.

193
00:08:53,806 --> 00:08:55,006
Your family

194
00:08:55,166 --> 00:08:56,845
is getting merrier.

195
00:09:09,721 --> 00:09:11,321
(How should I tell her?)

196
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:13,680
What's wrong?

197
00:09:14,121 --> 00:09:15,681
Why are you being secretive?

198
00:09:16,599 --> 00:09:17,159
Xiaoyu,

199
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:19,000
from now on

200
00:09:19,202 --> 00:09:20,642
until we get the result

201
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:21,560
and fill in our ambitions...

202
00:09:22,082 --> 00:09:22,762
No.

203
00:09:23,203 --> 00:09:24,283
Until we go to university.

204
00:09:24,684 --> 00:09:25,923
We need to stay together.

205
00:09:26,048 --> 00:09:26,929
What's wrong?

206
00:09:27,604 --> 00:09:28,244
Just promise me.

207
00:09:30,283 --> 00:09:30,843
Okay.

208
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:31,640
I promise.

209
00:09:32,167 --> 00:09:33,087
This time,

210
00:09:33,409 --> 00:09:35,089
I'll protect you.
