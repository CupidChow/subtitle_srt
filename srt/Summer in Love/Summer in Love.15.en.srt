Wasn't he with you?

81

He sent me a text this morning.

82

He said he was looking
for your boyfriend.

83

What was he talking about?

84

He's a grown-up.

92
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:13,170
He knows his way back home.

93

Why not we look for him?

95
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:17,210
There are not many places
that he will go.
