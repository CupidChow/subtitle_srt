1
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:24,919
President Chen.

2
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:25,879
I was wrong.

3
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:26,759
I really know I was wrong.

4
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,080
I know that

5
00:02:28,159 --> 00:02:28,879
There are many shortcomings.

6
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:30,840
But I will definitely try my best.

7
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:31,719
It has nothing to do with you.

8
00:02:31,879 --> 00:02:32,520
Stop thinking about it.

9
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:35,759
President Long is now

10
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,919
Let him do it if he wants to.

11
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,360
Tell your people

12
00:02:43,479 --> 00:02:44,599
You can do whatever you want.

13
00:02:44,919 --> 00:02:46,360
Mr. Long has his own principles.

14
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:49,199
I see.

15
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,479
I'll do it right away.

16
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:51,960
Goodbye, President Chen.

17
00:03:14,199 --> 00:03:15,360
Long Yi.

18
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:18,599
Are you sick?

19
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,039
It's not what you think.

20
00:03:21,879 --> 00:03:23,280
You shouldn't have kept a good dragon.

21
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,120
To be a security guard here.

22
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,360
Chen Xuanyi didn't bother.

23
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,759
Chen Xuanyi gave me the order.

24
00:03:32,199 --> 00:03:32,599
Really?

25
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,120
Then Xuan Yi must have her reasons.

26
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:36,919
However

27
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,319
What are you doing?

28
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:44,039
Zhang Jingmei is right.

29
00:03:44,719 --> 00:03:45,879
For the Long Group,

30
00:03:46,439 --> 00:03:47,159
I'm a security guard.

31
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,199
I can only guard it.

32
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:49,319
Security Guard

33
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,159
That's an analogy.

34
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:53,039
Do you understand

35
00:03:55,039 --> 00:03:55,840
Example

36
00:03:57,080 --> 00:04:00,080
Zhang Jingmei wants me to be myself.

37
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:01,400
She said so herself.

38
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,319
Who am I?

39
00:04:02,719 --> 00:04:03,599
I'm a security guard.

40
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:04,479
Is a security guard.

41
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,159
Are you sure that Zhang Jingmei thinks so?

42
00:04:10,599 --> 00:04:11,639
I think you've been

43
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,759
Mind control?

44
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:17,800
You really think so?

45
00:04:19,439 --> 00:04:20,839
You don't even want the studio.

46
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,120
You...

47
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,800
Is too rational.

48
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:29,959
reason

49
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,439
This is crazy, okay?

50
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,240
Zhang Jingmei, are you sick?

51
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,199
Raise your head.

52
00:04:44,839 --> 00:04:46,800
Let's not talk about anything else.

53
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,399
Let's talk about how Long Yi treats you.

54
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,720
Don't you think she cares about you?

55
00:04:52,839 --> 00:04:54,839
How many other men are there?

56
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,000
You still want to separate from her?

57
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,000
Are you crazy?

58
00:05:02,199 --> 00:05:03,199
Only when I leave him,

59
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:04,680
He will be Long Yi.

60
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,160
You can explain it to them.

61
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:09,920
We don't have to break up.

62
00:05:10,759 --> 00:05:12,079
I can't explain.

63
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:14,920
As long as I am with him,

64
00:05:15,079 --> 00:05:17,160
He will think for me in everything.

65
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,000
I can't hurt him.

66
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:25,920
He's Long Yi.

67
00:05:26,839 --> 00:05:28,439
He's so proud.

68
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:30,600
So brilliant.

69
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,480
So bright and shiny.

70
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:34,120
Because of me, Zhang Jingmei,

71
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:36,319
He can be desperate.

72
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:37,519
You did everything for me.

73
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,439
For his own sake.

74
00:05:40,279 --> 00:05:41,879
His future is so far ahead.

75
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,560
But he doesn't care.

76
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:45,399
What am I?

77
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,160
I'm not important at all.

78
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,480
I can give it all up.

79
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,839
I just want him to be his old self.

80
00:05:55,439 --> 00:05:56,160
That's it.

81
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,639
Long Yi.

82
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,800
You are not the Dragon One I know.

83
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:14,480
You know what?

84
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,240
If you do this,

85
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,240
Your family doesn't care about it.

86
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,040
If they know

87
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,759
You're working as a security guard under the Long Mansion.

88
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,279
I won't skin you.

89
00:06:23,879 --> 00:06:26,240
What? You're a security guard?

90
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,399
Yes, it's been two days.

91
00:06:28,959 --> 00:06:30,399
She said she wanted Jingmei to stimulate her.

92
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:31,040
I can't do that.

93
00:06:31,879 --> 00:06:33,560
Look, the head of the security guard

94
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,839
How embarrassing.

95
00:06:36,759 --> 00:06:37,959
I think so.

96
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:39,639
What?

97
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,759
Everyone in the company is laughing.

98
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:43,399
dad

99
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,319
Call him back.

100
00:06:45,319 --> 00:06:46,480
I listen to you.

101
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,879
Why are you so anxious?

102
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:48,959
In two days,

103
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:51,480
I'll see what he can do.

104
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,920
Don't worry.

105
00:06:55,319 --> 00:06:57,720
The wedding is coming next week.

106
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,519
A lot of things are waiting for him.

107
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,360
Isn't that next week?

108
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:01,959
That's right.

109
00:07:01,959 --> 00:07:03,800
I'm calmer than you.

110
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:07,120
Marrying a wife is like doing business.

111
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:08,399
Don't be anxious.

112
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:10,040
It's yours. It can't run away.

113
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:11,199
It's not yours.

114
00:07:12,439 --> 00:07:14,439
Don't force me.

115
00:07:15,879 --> 00:07:17,360
You're a security guard.

116
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,040
Saying you're a security guard?

117
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:24,199
The whole company knows you're not a security guard.

118
00:07:24,439 --> 00:07:25,560
You're not a security guard.

119
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:26,959
You have to wear a security uniform as a security guard.

120
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,959
What are you doing, Long Yi?

121
00:07:41,399 --> 00:07:42,319
Pay the bill, Luo Beichen.

122
00:07:42,439 --> 00:07:43,000
I'm full.

123
00:07:44,519 --> 00:07:45,680
Dragon, dragon.

124
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,800
Stand still.

125
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,360
Say something.

126
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:01,240
I've communicated with the superior directly.

127
00:08:02,839 --> 00:08:04,519
They clearly indicated that

128
00:08:05,279 --> 00:08:09,800
Mr. Long came to our department as a security guard.

129
00:08:09,959 --> 00:08:12,639
That's incognito.

130
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:14,480
therefore

131
00:08:15,079 --> 00:08:15,879
For us,

132
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,319
It's an opportunity.

133
00:08:18,199 --> 00:08:19,000
Is a challenge.

134
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,439
And the leader.

135
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,000
To our department.

136
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:24,240
Understand?

137
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:30,600
Mr. Long is here.

138
00:08:31,079 --> 00:08:32,080
What should I say?

139
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:32,879
Pay attention to yourself.

140
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:37,840
Sorry to be late.

141
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:38,399
Morning, Mr. Long.

142
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:41,919
What are you doing?

143
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,519
We had a morning meeting earlier.

144
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,159
Sorry

145
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,440
I didn't know there was a morning meeting.

146
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,440
I'll be there early tomorrow.

147
00:08:50,879 --> 00:08:53,679
There's no morning meeting tomorrow.

148
00:08:54,279 --> 00:08:56,200
I'll be there early the day after tomorrow.

149
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:57,000
I'm sure

150
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,120
There's no morning meeting the day after tomorrow.

151
00:08:59,120 --> 00:08:59,759
one week

152
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:01,480
No

153
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:02,879
We...

154
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,000
One morning meeting a month, right?

155
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,279
Then I...

156
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:12,039
What should I do today, Captain?

157
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:13,759
President Long.

158
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:17,000
Why don't you go to the reception room to register today?

159
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:19,639
good

160
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,279
Super close.

161
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:34,759
President Long.

162
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,039
come back

163
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:39,759
What are you doing?

164
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:40,960
Alright.

165
00:10:09,919 --> 00:10:10,559
President Long.

166
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:14,399
Thank you, President Long.

167
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:17,320
I'm busy now.

168
00:10:30,159 --> 00:10:30,759
President Long.

169
00:10:30,919 --> 00:10:31,840
Thank you.

170
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:50,720
Hello

171
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,320
I want to ask how to get to A03.

172
00:10:52,679 --> 00:10:54,000
You need to register your name.

173
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:55,799
XinYi

174
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,320
XinYi

175
00:10:57,519 --> 00:10:58,159
telephone

176
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,039
1908.

177
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:01,120
1908.

178
00:11:14,759 --> 00:11:17,399
Dad, look at Yi's wedding.

179
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,879
How long have you been a security guard?

180
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,600
For more than a week.

181
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,240
But the reaction is good.

182
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,360
Alright.

183
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:32,759
I just received a notice.

184
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:35,679
The chairman of our group, Chairman Long,

185
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:38,080
To hire a security guard.

186
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:40,519
A skilled driver and security guard.

187
00:11:41,559 --> 00:11:43,200
Please introduce yourself.

188
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:44,919
What are you doing?

189
00:11:45,759 --> 00:11:46,799
This is a good chance.

190
00:11:46,919 --> 00:11:47,960
Why are you pulling me, brother?

191
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:48,759
I got my license.

192
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,759
Your driver's license is fine.

193
00:11:50,879 --> 00:11:51,960
What's wrong with you?

194
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:54,159
What are you doing?

195
00:11:54,279 --> 00:11:55,600
There's nothing wrong with me.

196
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,480
If I say you have a problem, you will.

197
00:11:57,879 --> 00:11:58,799
Is there a driver?

198
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:01,960
That

199
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:08,279
Alright, Long Yi, you're on.

200
00:12:08,799 --> 00:12:09,759
I didn't raise my hand.

201
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,200
Everyone voted for you.

202
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:15,399
We can't drive, President Long.

203
00:12:15,559 --> 00:12:16,720
What a coincidence!

204
00:12:16,799 --> 00:12:18,000
You can't drive without a license.

205
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:40,080
Tell me about it.

206
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:43,399
What have you learned as a security guard these days?

207
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,120
I didn't learn anything.

208
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:47,759
Is to learn about security work.

209
00:12:47,759 --> 00:12:49,519
By the way, I want to know about Long Group.

210
00:12:51,559 --> 00:12:53,639
To know about Long Group.

211
00:12:54,919 --> 00:12:55,639
Tell me about it.

212
00:12:56,159 --> 00:12:56,919
Long Group.

213
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,840
There are 583 employees.

214
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,120
Belong to 15 departments.

215
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:02,120
The network department is the most overtime department.

216
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,120
The sales department is always late.

217
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,720
The Commerce Department drove the car.

218
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:06,879
Better than other departments.

219
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:08,679
Our security department

220
00:13:08,759 --> 00:13:10,360
Is the easiest to fish in troubled waters.

221
00:13:12,039 --> 00:13:13,080
Alright.

222
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:14,120
Anything else?

223
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:15,759
Everyone reported that

224
00:13:15,759 --> 00:13:17,559
The food in the canteen is not very good.

225
00:13:17,559 --> 00:13:18,559
And,

226
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:21,279
There are fewer elevators.

227
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:22,840
And you're also a part of

228
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,759
You are indeed my grandson of Long Zai Yuan.

229
00:13:28,159 --> 00:13:28,840
good

230
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,320
From tomorrow,

231
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:31,840
I'll ask them to change it.

232
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:39,399
Grandpa, tell me.

233
00:13:40,919 --> 00:13:43,759
What's the difference between me and a security guard?

234
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:46,440
The security guard

235
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:49,240
I only care about whether the thieves enter the building.

236
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:51,240
What you need to care about

237
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:53,480
All the people in this building.

238
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,679
And the livelihood and happiness of their families.

239
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,200
I won the championship.

240
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,120
Congratulations.

241
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:15,480
Where is the ring?

242
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:18,919
That's right.

243
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:21,320
Actually, you can't be impulsive.

244
00:14:21,879 --> 00:14:23,159
Let's have a chat.

245
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:23,720
Alright.

246
00:14:23,879 --> 00:14:24,600
Then give me the ring.

247
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:25,440
I want to propose to you.

248
00:14:26,279 --> 00:14:27,559
What marriage?

249
00:14:27,559 --> 00:14:28,480
Your sister

250
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,159
My sister is not a problem.

251
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:31,679
Don't always reject me with my sister.

252
00:14:32,159 --> 00:14:32,960
Zhang Dong Shuai

253
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,320
Why are you here?

254
00:14:35,679 --> 00:14:37,360
He came to see you?

255
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:38,559
Isn't that

256
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:40,080
Didn't you win the championship in the game?

257
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:41,000
Look.

258
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:42,480
sister

259
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:43,360
Zhang Dong Shuai

260
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:46,519
sister

261
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:48,639
There's something I've been wanting to tell you.

262
00:14:49,159 --> 00:14:50,080
I like a girl.

263
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:51,519
But because of you,

264
00:14:52,279 --> 00:14:53,399
I don't think it suits me.

265
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:54,919
But I'm sincere to her.

266
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:57,320
Sister, I hope you can understand and support me.

267
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,000
Okay?

268
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:07,840
Xiao Xiao, I want to marry you.

269
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,360
Zhang Dong Shuai

270
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:14,399
I told you,

271
00:15:15,399 --> 00:15:17,399
You can't be impulsive about this.

272
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,799
Why are you so disobedient?

273
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:21,440
very small

274
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:23,120
It's my fault.

275
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,120
I was too impulsive.

276
00:15:24,519 --> 00:15:26,320
Don't do that.

277
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,320
I'm sorry. I was wrong.

278
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:08,960
Sister, when did it happen?

279
00:16:11,399 --> 00:16:12,399
Recently,

280
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:16,639
He didn't bully you, right?

281
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,600
I bullied him.

282
00:16:25,879 --> 00:16:27,039
Actually, brother-in-law

283
00:16:30,279 --> 00:16:31,679
Is there no turning back?

284
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,759
Calm down.

285
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:45,600
Brother-in-law loves you very much.

286
00:16:46,039 --> 00:16:47,279
Whether it's about your people,

287
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:48,279
Or your business?

288
00:16:48,879 --> 00:16:50,279
He will give it wholeheartedly.

289
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:52,559
Whether it's my parents or me,

290
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:58,840
sister

291
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,320
No matter what decision you make,

292
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:01,360
I will support you.

293
00:17:03,679 --> 00:17:04,640
Don't worry about your parents.

294
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:05,960
You still have me.

295
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:14,559
Thank you.

296
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,599
I'm your brother.

297
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,039
Move quickly. Don't stand still.

298
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:25,599
Zhang Dong Shuai

299
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,400
Xiao Xiao will be happy if she marries you.

300
00:17:35,799 --> 00:17:36,720
That's right.

301
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,759
Jingmei went back to her parents.

302
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,119
You brought so many things.

303
00:17:41,279 --> 00:17:42,359
My sister hasn't had her wedding yet.

304
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,839
This is going back to our home, okay?

305
00:17:43,839 --> 00:17:44,559
almost

306
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:45,359
It's almost there.

307
00:17:45,359 --> 00:17:46,240
It's much worse.

308
00:17:46,839 --> 00:17:47,759
Not to mention the wedding,

309
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:48,839
Is to hold a wedding.

310
00:17:48,839 --> 00:17:49,839
But also to our own home.

311
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:52,799
Jingmei, you're back.

312
00:17:53,119 --> 00:17:54,400
I was looking for you.

313
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,200
Why are you looking for me, aunt?

314
00:17:56,519 --> 00:17:58,160
Aren't we going to attend your wedding?

315
00:17:58,559 --> 00:17:59,880
Our senior dance team

316
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,279
To prepare a performance.

317
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,279
I want to perform for you at your wedding.

318
00:18:04,079 --> 00:18:05,720
See if Man is satisfied.

319
00:18:06,279 --> 00:18:07,039
Come on, sisters.

320
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,759
Come on. Let's perform.

321
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,160
One or two

322
00:18:10,279 --> 00:18:14,000
You are the most beautiful cloud in my horizon.

323
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:17,240
Let me stay with you.

324
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,200
You and Yi are good.

325
00:18:21,359 --> 00:18:22,920
Why did you move back suddenly?

326
00:18:24,599 --> 00:18:27,319
Mom and Dad, I want to...

327
00:18:28,039 --> 00:18:28,640
mom

328
00:18:28,759 --> 00:18:29,640
This is also my sister's home.

329
00:18:29,839 --> 00:18:30,880
She can come back if she wants.

330
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:31,759
What's the big deal?

331
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:33,720
When her daughter comes back,

332
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,400
You're not happy.

333
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:36,680
I'm telling you,

334
00:18:37,359 --> 00:18:38,559
Call Xiao Yi back later.

335
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:39,599
To have a meal together.

336
00:18:40,039 --> 00:18:41,400
I want to give him a formal lesson.

337
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,079
You love her.

338
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:46,319
Of course I'm glad to see Jing Mei back.

339
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:47,640
But it's unnecessary.

340
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:48,880
It's like moving.

341
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,519
Bring all the luggage back.

342
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:54,640
Aren't you celebrating my achievement today?

343
00:18:54,839 --> 00:18:56,279
Why is it my sister's home again?

344
00:18:56,519 --> 00:18:57,759
To celebrate your achievement.

345
00:18:57,759 --> 00:18:58,240
Look.

346
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,680
It's all your favorite food.

347
00:19:00,599 --> 00:19:01,240
Eat.

348
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:03,440
eat

349
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:04,119
Eat.

350
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:09,160
What's wrong, Mum?

351
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:09,680
mom

352
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,400
Dad, what's wrong with my mom?

353
00:19:16,359 --> 00:19:17,720
Have a meal.

354
00:19:23,559 --> 00:19:25,720
You're two shots ahead of me.

355
00:19:26,599 --> 00:19:27,960
Stop gossiping.

356
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:29,319
I just want to know

357
00:19:29,319 --> 00:19:31,039
How many fine wines are there in the winery?

358
00:19:31,279 --> 00:19:32,319
You want to say that my grandson

359
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:33,759
It's much worse than yours.

360
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,440
I'm in my twenties.

361
00:19:36,279 --> 00:19:37,279
Look at his steady energy.

362
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:38,880
Grow up and become a real man.

363
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:40,799
Don't praise him.

364
00:19:41,119 --> 00:19:42,680
He's far from good.

365
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:43,599
And train them.

366
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:01,279
Okay, congratulations.

367
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,640
9527, sir.

368
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:08,519
OK

369
00:20:08,519 --> 00:20:09,839
The item below

370
00:20:09,839 --> 00:20:11,880
Is the work of young painter Yuan Bin.

371
00:20:12,039 --> 00:20:13,039
In the woods,

372
00:20:13,359 --> 00:20:14,799
The starting price is 500,000 yuan.

373
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:15,319
grandpa

374
00:20:15,599 --> 00:20:18,279
Don't you think I've failed too much?

375
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,279
What are you doing?

376
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:21,759
Do you like it?

377
00:20:24,359 --> 00:20:26,359
Yes, Jingmei is right.

378
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:29,000
I'm nothing but a dragon.

379
00:20:29,599 --> 00:20:30,559
Raise the sign.

380
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:35,319
All right.

381
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,359
Mr. 031, 600 thousand yuan.

382
00:20:37,559 --> 00:20:38,400
Is there any more?

383
00:20:40,119 --> 00:20:42,319
I can't be a security guard.

384
00:20:42,519 --> 00:20:44,400
Grandpa, I feel I'm the driver now.

385
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:46,039
I don't think so.

386
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:47,079
OK

387
00:20:47,319 --> 00:20:49,279
Mr. 079, 700,000 yuan.

388
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:49,640
grandpa

389
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:50,559
Hold it.

390
00:20:54,599 --> 00:20:55,480
To be honest, Grandpa,

391
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:56,319
I didn't know I was

392
00:20:56,319 --> 00:20:57,519
What else can I do?

393
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,400
Mr. 031, 800 thousand yuan.

394
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:01,640
OK

395
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:04,319
Madam 0312, 900,000 yuan.

396
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:05,880
Is there anything else?

397
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:06,880
It's impossible.

398
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:09,400
Please show me the way.

399
00:21:11,279 --> 00:21:12,039
I haven't added it yet.

400
00:21:12,599 --> 00:21:13,599
Hold it.

401
00:21:13,759 --> 00:21:14,519
Once.

402
00:21:16,319 --> 00:21:17,240
900,000 twice.

403
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:18,960
I feel I'm redundant sometimes.

404
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,200
Grandpa, really.

405
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:21,680
Okay, Mr. Zero Three One.

406
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:22,920
For 950,000 yuan.

407
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:23,880
Is there any more on the stage?

408
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:25,720
Grandpa, what should I do now?

409
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:26,279
I

410
00:21:26,839 --> 00:21:27,400
lift

411
00:21:28,759 --> 00:21:30,359
Are you listening to me?

412
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:31,119
OK

413
00:21:31,119 --> 00:21:32,960
One million for Mr 031.

414
00:21:33,279 --> 00:21:35,000
Is there any more on the stage?

415
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:36,519
lift

416
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:39,759
I'm not lifting.

417
00:21:39,759 --> 00:21:41,240
What a crap!

418
00:21:41,559 --> 00:21:42,759
1.1 million once.

419
00:21:43,839 --> 00:21:44,960
1.1 million twice.

420
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:50,680
One million, two hundred thousand.

421
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:52,039
Grandpa, this painting is worthless.

422
00:21:52,319 --> 00:21:53,000
What are you doing?

423
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:53,880
Is there a price increase?

424
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,079
Is it worth it?

425
00:21:56,359 --> 00:21:57,440
It's not up to them.

426
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:01,519
You just lost tens of thousands.

427
00:22:01,759 --> 00:22:02,880
I feel useless.

428
00:22:04,519 --> 00:22:05,839
Your father and I

429
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:09,160
We lost all our assets several times.

430
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,279
From the beginning.

431
00:22:13,799 --> 00:22:15,279
When you're doing business,

432
00:22:15,519 --> 00:22:17,039
Don't give up easily.

433
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:18,079
And try to get leaflets.

434
00:22:19,079 --> 00:22:20,640
When you were a security guard,

435
00:22:21,279 --> 00:22:24,279
To know the whole company every day.

436
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:27,039
When you were caddie,

437
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,799
Don't be anxious, bend down and pick up the ball.

438
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:34,160
You focus on whatever you are.

439
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,319
Do whatever you need to do.

440
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,839
This is success.

441
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:40,960
Got it?

442
00:22:41,839 --> 00:22:42,759
Three million twice.

443
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:44,240
Three million for the third time.

444
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,920
Congratulations to Mr. Zero Three One.

445
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:46,839
Three million.

446
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:49,039
Congratulations, Mr. 031.

447
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:52,680
Congratulations to Mr. Zero Three One.

448
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:56,039
From now on,

449
00:22:56,319 --> 00:22:58,400
The painter's painting

450
00:22:58,519 --> 00:23:00,400
Is no less than 3 million.

451
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:04,240
This is the value our Long family gave it.

452
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:07,759
You always remember who you are.

453
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:35,200
Congratulations to Mr. Zero Three Million.
