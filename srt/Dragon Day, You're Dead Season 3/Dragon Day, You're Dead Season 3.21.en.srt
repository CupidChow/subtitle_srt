1
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,560
The sea is cold at night.

2
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,360
If after you take the medicine,

3
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,639
If you're not feeling well,

4
00:02:24,759 --> 00:02:25,759
Call me anytime.

5
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:27,599
come

6
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,400
If I get burned,

7
00:02:39,639 --> 00:02:41,080
How can I call you?

8
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:43,400
I'll ask Secretary Zhao to accompany you.

9
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,639
Don't.

10
00:02:46,439 --> 00:02:47,199
Let's talk about it.

11
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,680
You need to rest now.

12
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,800
I'm not suitable here.

13
00:03:00,759 --> 00:03:01,680
Chen Xuanyi

14
00:03:03,039 --> 00:03:03,840
What are you avoiding?

15
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:11,360
Do you really have no feelings for me?

16
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,599
I don't need to feel for a boyfriend.

17
00:03:16,919 --> 00:03:17,960
I just need to be suitable.

18
00:03:20,919 --> 00:03:21,960
What's wrong with us?

19
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,000
You're not on the list.

20
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:27,240
Name list

21
00:03:29,719 --> 00:03:30,560
What list?

22
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,360
The list in my mind.

23
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:34,840
I need to find a husband.

24
00:03:35,439 --> 00:03:37,319
Will make me secure in the Chen family.

25
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,400
To get the property from my grandfather.

26
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,879
To compete with my uncle for resources.

27
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,000
Can make Third Uncle

28
00:03:43,719 --> 00:03:45,280
The Love Xuan City my father built

29
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:45,840
Give it back to me.

30
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:46,879
Can you do that?

31
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,080
You put love

32
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,360
As a business.

33
00:04:01,039 --> 00:04:01,639
That's right.

34
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:03,759
So don't bother me anymore.

35
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:04,520
Luo Beichen.

36
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,719
No wonder Yu Lang said

37
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,039
Worth 1 billion yuan.

38
00:04:13,639 --> 00:04:15,039
Will never be able to squeeze into ten billion circles.

39
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:17,800
It's late.

40
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:19,120
Have an early rest

41
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,240
Long Yi is good at everything.

42
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,199
Is to compare the axis of love.

43
00:04:24,759 --> 00:04:26,199
He won't leave Zhang Jingmei.

44
00:04:28,279 --> 00:04:29,079
Master Kitano.

45
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,720
You're really meddling.

46
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:51,040
I wouldn't have come with you.

47
00:04:51,319 --> 00:04:53,079
This place is too high.

48
00:04:53,319 --> 00:04:54,279
Don't be afraid.

49
00:04:54,839 --> 00:04:56,560
With Young Master Long protecting you,

50
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,839
Why are you so stingy?

51
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:01,319
Are you avenging your birthday?

52
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:15,199
I don't know how they are doing.

53
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:19,720
Yiyi is still worrying so much.

54
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,279
It's all your fault.

55
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,120
I can't even learn this.

56
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,879
How did the director handle it?

57
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:27,480
Yiyi.

58
00:05:27,959 --> 00:05:29,959
Why are you so strict with yourself?

59
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:32,160
Why are you calling me Yiyi?

60
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:35,319
Correct!

61
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,360
I forgot to ask my wife.

62
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,360
Why are you calling me Yiyi?

63
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,000
Isn't it because

64
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,199
Long Yi.

65
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:48,000
I didn't say anything.

66
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:48,959
Carbazole

67
00:05:49,079 --> 00:05:50,000
This one.

68
00:05:50,519 --> 00:05:51,439
I've passed.

69
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,199
So the camera is there.

70
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,920
I just found out today.

71
00:05:58,759 --> 00:06:00,639
The word "Ka" sounds so beautiful.

72
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,120
It's not a nice word.

73
00:06:04,279 --> 00:06:06,600
Our efforts have been responded to.

74
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:12,399
Here you are.

75
00:06:13,959 --> 00:06:14,519
What is this?

76
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:15,480
Your pay

77
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,040
Congratulations.

78
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,240
And the payment.

79
00:06:22,279 --> 00:06:24,040
You have been lying all night.

80
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:25,519
Only 100 yuan.

81
00:06:25,879 --> 00:06:27,079
Is it good?

82
00:06:29,079 --> 00:06:29,879
Don't forget it.

83
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,600
My

84
00:07:33,279 --> 00:07:33,639
Where is she?

85
00:07:35,319 --> 00:07:35,759
Where is it?

86
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:38,439
Zhao Mingzhe.

87
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,480
Where have you been?

88
00:07:42,439 --> 00:07:43,800
I won't turn off my phone tonight.

89
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,800
Call me when you get any news.

90
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,800
Thank you for your hearts.

91
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:23,759
Who should you talk to?

92
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:24,959
What's the use of you watching me?

93
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:26,920
Am I waiting for someone?

94
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,240
very small

95
00:08:29,079 --> 00:08:30,360
What's the hurry?

96
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,480
Jing Mei Jia Lin.

97
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,600
You're finally here.

98
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,600
Why are you so anxious?

99
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,039
Let's go.

100
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:34,639
Let's talk outside.

101
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,159
I only have half an hour.

102
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:37,240
My team has something to do.

103
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,240
Almost done

104
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,240
Let's go.

105
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:40,840
Today, I've specially made

106
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:41,759
The lovely Nezha head.

107
00:08:41,759 --> 00:08:42,399
Sixsixsix

108
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:43,480
Get down to business.

109
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,440
Remember to paint a rocket.

110
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:46,919
Thank you.

111
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:48,840
Go on.

112
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:49,519
Let's go on.

113
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:51,120
It's important to open the shop.

114
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:52,759
Of course, the live stream is important.

115
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:53,840
Let's go on, okay?

116
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:54,600
What about the shop?

117
00:08:54,679 --> 00:08:55,360
Let's have a look.

118
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:57,879
Boss

119
00:08:58,159 --> 00:08:59,600
What do you think I live on?

120
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,279
Your salary will be paid in two months.

121
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:02,519
For three months.

122
00:09:02,919 --> 00:09:03,960
You'll get a discount.

123
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:04,600
I'm not...

124
00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:06,039
If it weren't for you,

125
00:09:06,039 --> 00:09:07,480
Can my business be bad?

126
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,240
You and that Pandian girl

127
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,279
That's not true.

128
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,759
Our business is doing well.

129
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,679
And I'm live.

130
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:15,240
It can also bring you traffic.

131
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:15,639
you

132
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,320
Let's go on.

133
00:09:17,679 --> 00:09:18,679
Yes, that's it.

134
00:09:18,679 --> 00:09:19,759
Let's have a heart race.

135
00:09:22,519 --> 00:09:23,799
I now officially announce

136
00:09:23,919 --> 00:09:25,120
I want to sell this shop.

137
00:09:28,279 --> 00:09:30,440
Are you really going to open a shop?

138
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:32,759
Don't be impulsive.

139
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,519
I've thought it through.

140
00:09:35,039 --> 00:09:36,320
I have to sell this shop.

141
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,639
I called you here today.

142
00:09:38,799 --> 00:09:40,519
I'm afraid you'll turn against me later.

143
00:09:40,799 --> 00:09:42,879
So I'm telling you in advance.

144
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,279
No matter how Hu and I are,

145
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,279
I can't lose my career, right?

146
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:53,279
You all know I'm lazy.

147
00:09:54,159 --> 00:09:56,159
So only the milk tea shop can stay here.

148
00:09:57,399 --> 00:09:58,000
Look.

149
00:09:58,759 --> 00:10:01,279
This milk tea shop is so beautiful.

150
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
We'll drink milk tea here every day.

151
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,240
So happy.

152
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,720
The boss is anxious to transfer it.

153
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,039
Are you willing to give me a discount?

154
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,080
It's so cost-effective.

155
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:13,440
go

156
00:10:15,799 --> 00:10:16,960
Jing Mei Jia Lin.

157
00:10:17,159 --> 00:10:17,879
Look.

158
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:20,000
I'm going to fill these chairs.

159
00:10:21,039 --> 00:10:21,600
And then,

160
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,600
I won't move the cashier.

161
00:10:23,679 --> 00:10:24,960
Yes, and the red wall.

162
00:10:25,039 --> 00:10:26,000
To knock it off.

163
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:26,919
Make a partition.

164
00:10:27,039 --> 00:10:29,080
This side is also covered with tables and chairs.

165
00:10:29,919 --> 00:10:31,200
And this little girl.

166
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:32,639
I think it's great.

167
00:10:32,639 --> 00:10:33,600
I have to stay.

168
00:10:34,159 --> 00:10:36,039
You're determined.

169
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:40,240
Have you paid the deposit?

170
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:43,639
What do you think?

171
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,679
The shop can be opened.

172
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,600
Hu Da's money can't be used.

173
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:50,919
No

174
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,559
Why?

175
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,279
Old Hu gave me all the money.

176
00:10:57,879 --> 00:10:59,440
Why can't it work?

177
00:11:04,639 --> 00:11:05,799
What are you doing?

178
00:11:07,399 --> 00:11:08,320
To invest.

179
00:11:09,639 --> 00:11:12,399
Do you want to earn it alone?

180
00:11:12,759 --> 00:11:13,120
I

181
00:11:14,159 --> 00:11:16,080
Even if the three of us run it,

182
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,360
I'll draw up a contract when I get back.

183
00:11:17,399 --> 00:11:18,519
To your phones tonight.

184
00:11:18,759 --> 00:11:19,639
After you sign it,

185
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,039
Put it in a small place and keep it.

186
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,200
actually

187
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,639
You don't have to do this.

188
00:11:27,159 --> 00:11:28,799
Hu Da is a trap.

189
00:11:28,799 --> 00:11:30,399
If you dare to open a shop with his money,

190
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:31,360
I'm breaking up with you.

191
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:35,120
I have business.

192
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:35,639
Let's go.

193
00:11:35,639 --> 00:11:36,399
Okay, busy man.

194
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:37,120
Bye. Let's go.

195
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,000
very small

196
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,440
Opening a shop is a good thing.

197
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:46,360
We think you're right.

198
00:11:46,519 --> 00:11:48,519
This shop is really promising.

199
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:54,279
Just give Jialin and I a chance.

200
00:11:54,279 --> 00:11:55,679
The three of us can take care of each other.

201
00:11:55,679 --> 00:11:56,279
Right?

202
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:58,320
Jingmei

203
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,159
Alright, Boss Luo.

204
00:11:59,279 --> 00:11:59,960
Go shopping.

205
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:00,720
this

206
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,200
Miss Ma Ta Ta,

207
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,559
To see the special effects,

208
00:12:03,559 --> 00:12:04,879
Let's have a try.

209
00:12:11,399 --> 00:12:11,720
grandpa

210
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:13,559
Naughty boy.

211
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,200
What are you holding back?

212
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:15,840
Go ahead.

213
00:12:16,799 --> 00:12:17,240
grandpa

214
00:12:17,679 --> 00:12:18,519
I

215
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:20,279
To make money.

216
00:12:21,559 --> 00:12:22,360
To make money.

217
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:24,159
How much did you earn?

218
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:28,720
One billion.

219
00:12:29,879 --> 00:12:30,639
Hundred

220
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:34,799
Why are you showing off with me?

221
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:39,080
I'm not telling you anymore.

222
00:12:42,519 --> 00:12:43,200
grandpa

223
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,240
you

224
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:50,879
Have you seen the new 100?

225
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,799
This is the new edition.

226
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,080
It's really my first time to see

227
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:57,840
It's mine.

228
00:12:59,240 --> 00:12:59,799
grandpa

229
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:01,039
You can't take the money.

230
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,600
This is my money.

231
00:13:03,639 --> 00:13:05,559
Give it back to my grandfather.

232
00:13:10,799 --> 00:13:11,720
Who is it?

233
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:12,919
It's me.

234
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:13,879
Chen Xuanyi

235
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:23,519
Xuan Yi.

236
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:24,000
Come on.

237
00:13:24,039 --> 00:13:24,519
Please come in.

238
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:25,879
Here, I'll get you some water.

239
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,039
Luo Beichen, tell me.

240
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:28,600
I don't have time to talk nonsense to you.

241
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,279
Where is Zhao Mingzhe?

242
00:13:31,639 --> 00:13:32,399
Zhao Mingzhe.

243
00:13:33,639 --> 00:13:34,559
Isn't he in the room?

244
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:36,600
Before he went missing yesterday afternoon,

245
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,039
Is with you, right?

246
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,120
to lose contact

247
00:13:43,159 --> 00:13:44,080
What?

248
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,279
He's such a big man.

249
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,559
It must be on some island.

250
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,559
Who's staying here?

251
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:50,879
Luo Beichen.

252
00:13:51,759 --> 00:13:53,879
Zhao Mingzhe hasn't been seen for 12 hours.

253
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:55,559
He used to reply to my WeChat.

254
00:13:55,559 --> 00:13:57,159
It won't last more than 20 seconds.

255
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,240
When you were together yesterday,

256
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,519
What exactly did you tell him?

257
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:03,440
What?

258
00:14:07,799 --> 00:14:08,240
Stop fighting.

259
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:10,720
His phone has no signal.

260
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,840
It was turned off three hours ago.

261
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:20,360
shoot!

262
00:14:21,159 --> 00:14:22,000
This Zhao Mingzhe.

263
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,200
Luo Beichen.

264
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:46,159
Which island did Zhao Mingzhe go to?

265
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:47,840
I don't know.

266
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:48,840
I'm just pointing.

267
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:49,480
Who knows about him?

268
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:53,720
Xuan Yi.

269
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:54,919
Don't be too anxious.

270
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,200
Let's search one by one.

271
00:14:56,879 --> 00:14:57,720
We'll find it eventually.

272
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,039
Let's think on the bright side.

273
00:15:00,039 --> 00:15:01,279
What if he goes back himself?

274
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:03,200
Luo Beichen, let me tell you something.

275
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:05,159
If something happens to Zhao Mingzhe,

276
00:15:05,159 --> 00:15:06,120
I'm not finished with you.

277
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,159
Alright.

278
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:17,720
Xuan Yi, look.

279
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,000
Zhao Mingzhe.

280
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:24,840
Mingzhe

281
00:15:24,879 --> 00:15:25,639
Zhao Mingzhe.

282
00:15:25,639 --> 00:15:26,360
here

283
00:15:26,679 --> 00:15:27,480
Zhao Mingzhe.

284
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:28,480
Mingzhe

285
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,240
Zhao Mingzhe.

286
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:33,720
President Chen.

287
00:15:34,279 --> 00:15:35,360
I'm here.

288
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:36,440
Mingzhe

289
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:36,960
Zhao Mingzhe.

290
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:37,720
Mr. Luo,

291
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:41,240
I'm here.

292
00:15:42,799 --> 00:15:44,120
President Chen.

293
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:02,200
Why did you call me here in the middle of the night?

294
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:03,440
Why aren't you sleeping?

295
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,480
Young Master Long,

296
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,639
What philosophy of life are you thinking about?

297
00:16:15,159 --> 00:16:15,480
Nothing

298
00:16:16,039 --> 00:16:17,519
Is to look at my wife.

299
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:18,240
happy

300
00:16:19,399 --> 00:16:20,759
Why are you so happy?

301
00:16:21,679 --> 00:16:22,799
These two days,

302
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:24,559
I might have to ask for a leave.

303
00:16:25,799 --> 00:16:26,559
why

304
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,320
Are you sick?

305
00:16:29,919 --> 00:16:31,039
No.

306
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,720
There won't be any foreign friends.

307
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,279
Do you need us to serve you?

308
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,000
in your dreams!

309
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,320
You scared me to death.

310
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,120
I'll do the math.

311
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:42,080
Two days.

312
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,120
wrong

313
00:16:43,639 --> 00:16:44,120
Three days?

314
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:46,399
wrong

315
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:48,120
A day of moving.

316
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,559
For a whole day.

317
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,000
Moving and cleaning up.

318
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,039
And celebrate the day.

319
00:16:53,039 --> 00:16:54,000
That's right. Three days.

320
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,639
We're moving.

321
00:16:56,919 --> 00:16:57,200
That's right.

322
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:57,759
Don't you know?

323
00:16:57,759 --> 00:16:59,240
Grandpa asked us to move long ago.

324
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:00,279
Really

325
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,440
Grandpa, take it easy.

326
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:05,599
My grandfather,

327
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:06,519
Why?

328
00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:15,839
100 yuan. Why are you so stingy?

329
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:18,079
Not Grandpa.

330
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,799
This is not an ordinary 100 yuan.

331
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,079
I'm going to buy a gift for Jing Mei with this.

332
00:17:22,599 --> 00:17:23,440
I'll take the money.

333
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:24,880
I'll give you the gift.

334
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:25,880
Pick whatever you want.

335
00:17:26,039 --> 00:17:27,920
You can't do that, Grandpa.

336
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:31,720
grandpa

337
00:17:32,119 --> 00:17:34,759
You can pick any gift, right?

338
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:36,119
Pick any one.

339
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,799
I want to move out with Jingmei.

340
00:17:40,079 --> 00:17:41,079
Look.

341
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,000
to have become fully fledged

342
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,119
That's not what happened, Grandpa.

343
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,839
I have to move out first.

344
00:17:50,039 --> 00:17:51,599
To train yourself.

345
00:17:51,599 --> 00:17:52,720
To improve yourself.

346
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,000
So you can have strong wings?

347
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:54,720
is or isn't

348
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,480
If you can't survive outside,

349
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,440
Don't come back to me.

350
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,559
Don't worry, Grandpa.

351
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:03,079
Obey

352
00:18:06,359 --> 00:18:08,039
Long live Grandpa.

353
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:10,359
Are you so happy?

354
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:14,759
I can finally order takeout.

355
00:18:17,079 --> 00:18:18,720
I know how to eat.

356
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,200
But my wife

357
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,559
Haven't you been thinking about our balcony?

358
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:24,880
By then,

359
00:18:25,519 --> 00:18:26,440
I'll buy a lawn.

360
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:27,720
And a swing.

361
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:33,160
We'll swing on the lawn.

362
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:34,839
And look at the stars.

363
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,319
How wonderful it is.

364
00:18:37,319 --> 00:18:38,440
Aunt Huang has asked someone to clean it up.

365
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:41,039
We'll find time to move in these two days.

366
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:41,880
What about

367
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,480
husband

368
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,920
Such an evil smile.

369
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,000
What do you want?

370
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:56,319
Since you got married,

371
00:18:56,319 --> 00:18:58,279
You have the final say on every move.

372
00:18:58,599 --> 00:19:01,640
Can you listen to me this time?

373
00:19:02,319 --> 00:19:03,160
Then tell me.

374
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:04,559
有什么鬼点子

375
00:19:06,039 --> 00:19:10,039
I want to show you my life.

376
00:19:11,279 --> 00:19:12,119
Your life

377
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:27,440
Look.

378
00:19:28,119 --> 00:19:29,559
This is my junior high school.

379
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,759
You went to junior high here?

380
00:19:32,759 --> 00:19:33,400
The environment is too messy.

381
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,319
What do you know?

382
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:35,880
It's called order in chaos.

383
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:38,200
The surrounding area

384
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,960
All the buses and subways are available.

385
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:41,119
And within three minutes,

386
00:19:41,119 --> 00:19:43,079
Delicious and delicious.

387
00:19:43,079 --> 00:19:44,359
It's a long journey

388
00:19:44,359 --> 00:19:45,440
Only 20 minutes.

389
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,599
I can go home anytime after work.

390
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:50,519
well

391
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:51,640
Look at that.

392
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:52,599
The first big chicken steak

393
00:19:53,119 --> 00:19:54,119
And the pie.

394
00:19:54,119 --> 00:19:56,000
When I was in junior high.

395
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,559
I always buy breakfast here.

396
00:19:57,559 --> 00:19:59,039
Do you think

397
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:00,880
It has a firework smell.

398
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:01,680
I don't think so.

399
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:02,599
The taste is quite strong.

400
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:07,519
Nothing.

401
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:08,759
Also

402
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:11,559
How could Young Master Long get used to this kind of life?

403
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:13,559
But this is the life of ordinary people.

404
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,680
But I didn't expect that

405
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:18,319
You wouldn't back down so quickly.

406
00:20:21,559 --> 00:20:22,400
wife

407
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:23,519
It smells so good.

408
00:20:26,279 --> 00:20:27,599
to exaggerate

409
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,119
It's true.

410
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,319
wife

411
00:20:41,319 --> 00:20:42,880
I'm not moving.

412
00:20:43,119 --> 00:20:44,200
How can I move it?

413
00:20:44,319 --> 00:20:45,880
There are too many things.

414
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:49,200
Find the butler.

415
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:51,240
A young master

416
00:20:51,759 --> 00:20:54,599
There's no butler in our life.

417
00:20:55,279 --> 00:20:55,599
No

418
00:20:55,599 --> 00:20:56,119
to do  oneself

419
00:20:56,359 --> 00:20:58,000
Have ample food and clothing

420
00:20:58,319 --> 00:20:58,880
etc.

421
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:02,440
Take a rest.

422
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:03,839
I'll do it.

423
00:21:06,359 --> 00:21:07,000
Who is it?

424
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,160
Slow down.

425
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:11,039
Hello

426
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:11,799
Long Er's express.

427
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,519
My

428
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:14,920
That's a lot.

429
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:17,440
Thank you

430
00:21:18,839 --> 00:21:19,440
Thank you

431
00:21:20,359 --> 00:21:22,720
Okay, okay.

432
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:23,640
OK

433
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:27,599
gift

434
00:21:31,359 --> 00:21:32,759
Chicken soup for convenience.

435
00:21:32,759 --> 00:21:34,799
Pork bone and chicken flavor.

436
00:21:35,599 --> 00:21:36,799
It's tasty and refreshing.

437
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:38,400
I'm not sleepy all night.

438
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:40,400
You've been working in the crew for nothing.

439
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:41,319
What about the following?

440
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:45,559
Another kind of chicken soup.

441
00:21:48,359 --> 00:21:49,319
Say it again.

442
00:21:51,519 --> 00:21:52,200
I

443
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,119
I just picked the best one.

444
00:21:55,119 --> 00:21:56,119
Don't tell me.

445
00:21:56,119 --> 00:21:58,559
These boxes are full of chicken soup.

446
00:21:59,279 --> 00:21:59,839
wife

447
00:22:00,279 --> 00:22:01,920
She's busy with the crew.

448
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:02,440
If so,

449
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:03,119
You will be dead.

450
00:22:03,519 --> 00:22:04,039
to wait a moment

451
00:22:05,319 --> 00:22:05,880
wife

452
00:22:06,519 --> 00:22:07,400
Clean the bedroom.

453
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,000
Here, let me.
