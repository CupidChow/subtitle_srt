1
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:48,560
Mom,

2
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:50,910
You even want to lie to me.

3
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,360
Ever since you were little,

4
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,710
you never sleep when you have something on your mind.

5
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:01,560
Tell me,

6
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,520
did you have a fight with Long Yi?

7
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:15,870
You can move back without quarreling.

8
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,360
You don't want to tell me, do you?

9
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,800
Then I'll call Xiaoyi.

10
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:24,910
Ask him to pick you up.

11
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,470
Mom,

12
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:28,280
Mom.

13
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:35,280
We broke up.

14
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,520
We broke up.

15
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:41,800
Did he bully you?

16
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,750
Did he

17
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:45,840
do something wrong to you?

18
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:49,120
What's wrong with that?

19
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:50,800
You brat.

20
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,560
Mom, mom,

21
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:57,750
it's okay.

22
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,280
I'm sorry,

23
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:06,430
silly boy,

24
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:08,910
What's there to be sorry for?

25
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:11,750
No matter what decision you make,

26
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:14,360
I'll support you.

27
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:36,480
Mom,

28
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:37,750
What's going on?

29
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:42,560
Maybe I was

30
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:44,560
careless.

31
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:53,240
It's good.

32
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:54,950
Grandpa Chen,

33
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,920
I'm relieved to see Grandpa Chen.

34
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:58,190
You look good.

35
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,190
Grandpa Chen,

36
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:02,870
I need to answer the phone.

37
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:03,480
Dad,

38
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:04,510
Okay,

39
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:07,480
Yi

40
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:08,950
is much calmer now.

41
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,160
After all, she's a child.

42
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,830
You'll grow up one day.

43
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,870
Your daughter doesn't look very obvious.

44
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:21,040
Yes,

45
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,000
how can you just drink cold water?

46
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:25,430
You're so relieved as a mother.

47
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,270
Get her some hot water.

48
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:29,310
It's okay,

49
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,480
mom. I'm not thirsty anymore.

50
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:32,560
Hunian is right.

51
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,510
Go get the hot water.

52
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:35,750
Zhen Meili,

53
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:37,270
who is Zhen Meili?

54
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:40,310
Me

55
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,870
Who is it?

56
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:50,190
Uncle Li,

57
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:51,950
I'm in the hospital.

58
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:52,430
Don't worry,

59
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:54,480
Grandpa Chen is in great health.

60
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:56,870
-You were joking with me just now. -That's great, Mom.

61
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:00,600
Good thing.

62
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:01,600
Uncle Li, I'll hang up now.

63
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,830
Take it easy.

64
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:24,430
It's okay, mom.

65
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,160
I'll take care of that little thing for you.

66
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,870
Don't worry. I'm here.

67
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:29,950
At my age,

68
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:30,950
I don't have to

69
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:32,480
think too much.

70
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:34,680
Look how beautiful the kid's clothes are.

71
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:35,510
Which one looks better?

72
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:36,680
This one looks good.

73
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:38,310
Are you pregnant?

74
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:42,920
Mom, what do you mean?

75
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:44,430
Why did you hide it from me?

76
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:46,870
That's not true.

77
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:47,600
What is it?

78
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:51,000
Don't I even have the right to know that he exists?

79
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:52,160
I'm not pregnant.

80
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,600
It's not convenient to talk in this place.

81
00:06:59,070 --> 00:07:00,120
Let's go somewhere else.

82
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,870
I know what you want to ask?

83
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:30,720
It's not me who's pregnant,

84
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,270
it's my mom.

85
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:42,430
Then.

86
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,600
So you don't have to bear any burden on me.

87
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:48,870
I'm doing very well now.

88
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,120
so

89
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:02,720
It's impossible for us, isn't it?

90
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:06,840
Let's take a picture.

91
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,360
Three, two, one,

92
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,840
we're married.

93
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:14,910
Let's go home.

94
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:20,150
The beginning of the story is always very beautiful,

95
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,390
we always think,

96
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,960
As long as you love each other, you can go to the end.

97
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:29,480
But those differences that can't be used together,

98
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:33,030
will eventually create cracks in their growth.

99
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,480
Let's gradually realize the reality,

100
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,750
sometimes we just have to let go,

101
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:44,910
So that we can spread our wings and fly.

102
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,270
Since you're on vacation,

103
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,910
don't always think about those unhappy things.

104
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:24,320
Don't forget,

105
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,670
you're still my driver?

106
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:26,630
You have to listen to me.

107
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:28,440
Get in the car.

108
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:52,510
Yes,

109
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:53,510
I left this morning,

110
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,320
He should be in Korsten by now.

111
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,270
Actually,

112
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:00,320
Yi himself,

113
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:00,870
Well,

114
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:01,840
your milk tea is ready.

115
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,150
Okay,

116
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:05,910
put it here.

117
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:07,840
Childe Luo,

118
00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:09,750
just like you,

119
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:11,270
The nurses at the hospital,

120
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:14,510
they certainly don't want Chen Xuanyi's grandfather to leave the hospital,

121
00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:18,910
It's because she's about to leave the hospital.

122
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:21,360
That's why we need to hurry up and express our feelings.

123
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,080
Or you'll be discharged by then.

124
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:23,840
If the distance is too long,

125
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:27,080
it will be too late to regret it,

126
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:29,200
right, Jingmei

127
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:38,240
Well,

128
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,000
I'm leaving now.

129
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:42,670
-Take care. -Welcome again.

130
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,030
-Hello. -Order me a cup of this.

131
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:46,440
No sugar. Thank you.

132
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,150
Okay,

133
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:48,240
Jing Mei,

134
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:51,550
I think you should think about it again.

135
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:54,200
Yi has been waiting for you to change your mind.

136
00:11:58,390 --> 00:11:59,030
Tell him

137
00:11:59,200 --> 00:11:59,870
to have a good holiday,

138
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,000
-Don't look

139
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:06,270
back. -Bye.

140
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:11,750
What's wrong?

141
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,120
The cup is missing.

142
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:17,720
Where's the cup?

143
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:21,600
Here it is.

144
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,030
Look at you.

145
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:28,870
What's the use of crying here?

146
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,960
I really don't know if I should call you just now

147
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:32,960
or you're a coward?

148
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,550
What's the use of crying here?

149
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:37,720
Go find him.

150
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:44,080
I can't go to him.

151
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:50,440
These days,

152
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:53,080
you cried out how much water I used for a year.

153
00:12:58,030 --> 00:12:59,720
I really miss him.

154
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:06,840
Honey,

155
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:07,550
what are you doing?

156
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:08,440
Why are you wearing makeup?

157
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:09,790
None of your business.

158
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:11,870
I'm going to do something big today,

159
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:14,120
and you stay at home and cook for the kids.

160
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:17,910
Okay,

161
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:20,270
Isn't it beautiful?

162
00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:22,670
Here you go.

163
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:23,270
Thank you.

164
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,150
Can I make a small request?

165
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:28,000
I want a cup like this, too.

166
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,320
I want the same one,

167
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:29,960
so do I.

168
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,200
What's the difference?

169
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:31,910
It's different.

170
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:32,790
There's a picture on it.

171
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:34,270
Look,

172
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:35,550
Is there really

173
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:36,790
a problem?

174
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:40,030
What's wrong?

175
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:43,200
There's a picture

176
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:44,670
on the cup. Can you show me?

177
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:51,910
Let me make you another one.

178
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:53,030
No need.

179
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:53,390
Sorry,

180
00:13:53,390 --> 00:13:54,240
that's what I like.

181
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,960
This cup was an accident.

182
00:13:56,510 --> 00:13:56,960
Okay.

183
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,670
In-laws,

184
00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:42,120
since the two children broke up,

185
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,150
This Longhao Hotel

186
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:45,790
must be returned to you.

187
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:47,670
In-laws.

188
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,480
What you said is serious.

189
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:52,440
My whole family really likes Jingmei.

190
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,270
Maybe the two kids

191
00:14:54,270 --> 00:14:55,600
lost their temper for a while,

192
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:57,630
Maybe it'll be fine in a couple of days.

193
00:14:59,150 --> 00:15:00,870
What if it doesn't work out?

194
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:04,000
Don't worry.

195
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,200
About the baby,

196
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:06,960
I'm sure they'll take care of it.

197
00:15:07,390 --> 00:15:08,080
Deal with it.

198
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:11,870
I heard Yi went abroad, didn't she?

199
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:14,390
Are you going to relax?

200
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:15,120
all right

201
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:16,550
Go to relax,

202
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:19,030
and try to get the next relationship,

203
00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:21,750
During this period of time,

204
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,720
thank you for your concern and care for Jingmei.

205
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,320
I'll bless these two children from now on.

206
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,480
Be happy.

207
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:29,200
I'll get going.

208
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:31,120
In-laws.

209
00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:33,750
Long Hao Hotel,

210
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:35,630
since the Long family gave it to Jingmei,

211
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:36,750
No matter what,

212
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:37,790
we can't take it back.

213
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:39,150
Do you want to

214
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:40,150
take it back or not?

215
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:41,270
We won't take it.

216
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,840
Just pretend that we've never changed hands,

217
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:45,440
we can't live without our daughter,

218
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,600
Just accept the betrothal gift.

219
00:15:47,390 --> 00:15:48,150
In-laws.

220
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:48,910
No, no, no.

221
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,030
In-laws are not suitable,

222
00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:51,510
really not suitable.

223
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:52,630
Goodbye.

224
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:05,670
Mr. Zhen,

225
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:06,840
Mr. Zhen,

226
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:08,000
I found you.

227
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:09,200
Our seafood this morning

228
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:10,150
hasn't arrived yet.

229
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:11,480
I quit.

230
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:13,120
Stop calling me Ms. Zhen.

231
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,320
If you call me Zhen Meili,

232
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,440
can the boss still resign?

233
00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:25,480
Xuanyi,

234
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,550
the thought of you getting married,

235
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:31,720
Grandpa is really reluctant to part with it.

236
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:32,630
Grandpa,

237
00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:35,270
I still have a long way to go to get married.

238
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:37,910
My granddaughter has grown up.

239
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:42,240
I've really decided to be with Luo.

240
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:46,270
Even if I give up my family property,

241
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,120
I still want to be with him.

242
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:51,200
Grandpa,

243
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:54,960
I think Luo Beichen is right.

244
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,510
If dad were still alive,

245
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:59,550
he probably wouldn't want me to be like this,

246
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,000
But I've made up my mind.

247
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:03,440
I think in my mind,

248
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:05,400
Luo Beichen is more important than family property.

249
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:09,590
Grandpa is too old

250
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,960
to keep looking at your uncle and uncle,

251
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:17,350
From now on, you'll have to rely on yourself.

252
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:21,160
Grandpa,

253
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:22,640
Luo is here.

254
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:24,880
Grandpa, are you feeling better? Grandpa,

255
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:25,720
I feel much better.

256
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:26,510
I feel better now.

257
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:27,790
Let's see what I've brought you.

258
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:34,200
Milk tea with red beans.

259
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:36,720
This is all I want.

260
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:39,270
Grandpa can't eat sweet food.

261
00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:40,440
Why do you still want him?

262
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:41,030
Chicken soup.

263
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:44,790
Luo,

264
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,440
it tastes good.

265
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:50,160
As long as Grandpa likes it.

266
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:56,510
Go ahead.

267
00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:00,960
Grandpa is not old enough

268
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:04,030
to see that you pushed me out to have something to say,

269
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:07,000
Grandpa,

270
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,400
I know how hard Xuanyi works,

271
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,830
I don't want to marry me because of her.

272
00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:15,400
Let her suffer.

273
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,400
Let me tell you first, Grandpa,

274
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,830
I will never leave Xuanyi.

275
00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:23,880
If she marries you,

276
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:25,830
I'll give her a dowry

277
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,680
that you can't imagine.

278
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:32,400
But it's still much less than

279
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:34,240
what she should have received.

280
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:36,750
Grandpa,

281
00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:41,680
do you think you won't leave Xuanyi?

282
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,680
And I told her not to give up so many ways.

283
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:46,350
Yes,

284
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:46,880
Really?

285
00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:48,110
What method?

286
00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:51,110
Are you going to change your surname to Chen?

287
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:53,590
Last name is Chen,

288
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:55,110
Okay.

289
00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:56,400
Grandpa, don't go back

290
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:56,960
on your words.

291
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,270
Are you really willing to do that?

292
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,920
You're the only child in the family.

293
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:03,400
In this era,

294
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:04,510
what's your last name?

295
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:06,750
Xuanyi's happiness is the most important.

296
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:07,440
Am I right?

297
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:11,240
Well, you'd better

298
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:13,550
go through your dad's test first.

299
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:15,960
Strictly speaking,

300
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:17,720
this is my own business.

301
00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:20,920
But what about respecting Luo?

302
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:23,510
I'd better discuss it with him.

303
00:19:26,110 --> 00:19:28,270
It's better to be young.

304
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:29,830
-What are you talking about? -Grandpa, let's

305
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:30,790
go. Grandpa,

306
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:31,960
Let's move forward.

307
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:32,240
Okay,

308
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:32,640
Come on,

309
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:34,680
The weather is so nice today.

310
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:35,830
That's right.

311
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,070
Ashe,

312
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:07,070
why are you here?

313
00:20:07,550 --> 00:20:08,240
I'm looking for you.

314
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:09,550
You want to see me?

315
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:10,200
Yeah,

316
00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:13,590
I'd like to invite you to watch the satellite launch,

317
00:20:14,510 --> 00:20:15,680
Satellite launch.

318
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:26,830
You really built your own rocket?

319
00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:28,440
Of course,

320
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,030
since it's something you like,

321
00:20:30,350 --> 00:20:31,400
If you don't do it yourself,

322
00:20:32,510 --> 00:20:33,350
who will do it for you?

323
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:37,640
It's going to be launched.

324
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:39,640
Do you remember

325
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,960
the Starnet project I told you before?

326
00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:43,790
The Star Net Project

327
00:20:43,790 --> 00:20:44,640
was launched today.

328
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,550
It's the first satellite of the Star Network Project.

329
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:48,830
With this first step,

330
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:51,270
it will be easier in the future.

331
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:54,550
Is it the stupid wireless network you mentioned?

332
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:57,680
With this wireless network,

333
00:20:58,030 --> 00:20:59,400
my self-driving car

334
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:00,880
will be free.

335
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:01,960
Wait, wait, wait.

336
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:04,070
-Why are you driving on your own

337
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:05,200
again? -Is that okay? That.

338
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:05,750
Yes,

339
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:08,550
the traditional network signal

340
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:10,270
has a lot of disadvantages.

341
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:12,400
Not only is its transmission speed limited,

342
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,480
but its stability is also not good.

343
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:17,830
That's why I made this Star Network.

344
00:21:20,110 --> 00:21:21,070
Good for you.

345
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:23,400
You have a good idea.

346
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:24,070
What else can I do?

347
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:28,440
Really?

348
00:21:28,550 --> 00:21:29,510
With so many people watching,

349
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:31,590
there are still reminders,

350
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,070
Why are you

351
00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:36,790
wearing sunglasses lately?

352
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,350
So you're famous.

353
00:21:41,030 --> 00:21:42,000
What's your name?

354
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,480
My sister was crying.

355
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:47,590
Leave me alone.

356
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,440
That's true.

357
00:22:02,550 --> 00:22:03,640
Give him a call.

358
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:07,200
Long Yi's Moments

359
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:08,240
has been abroad,

360
00:22:09,550 --> 00:22:10,720
Are you not coming back?

361
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:14,110
How about I ask for you?

362
00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:15,240
You have to ask yourself.

363
00:22:17,550 --> 00:22:19,000
We don't have a relationship anymore.

364
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,110
You're crying like this.

365
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:23,960
You said it's okay.

366
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:27,640
Where's Yi?

367
00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:31,920
You brat.

368
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:34,550
You don't have a sense of time at all.

369
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:38,830
Xiaoyi

370
00:22:40,790 --> 00:22:41,350
Where is she?
