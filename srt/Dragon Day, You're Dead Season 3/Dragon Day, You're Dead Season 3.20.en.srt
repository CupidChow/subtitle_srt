1
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:18,719
Just two cups.

2
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:20,400
Secretary Zhao, don't you want to drink?

3
00:02:20,719 --> 00:02:21,319
Just two cups.

4
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,120
Waiter/Waitress

5
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,000
Please get me another cup of hot water.

6
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,280
Yes, sir.

7
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,120
Thank you

8
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,039
So healthy?

9
00:02:27,039 --> 00:02:27,919
Secretary Zhao.

10
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:31,039
President Chen likes to drink hot water.

11
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,159
Secretary Zhao is so thoughtful.

12
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,719
No wonder President Chen

13
00:02:35,719 --> 00:02:36,840
I have to take you with me.

14
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:38,599
It's my job.

15
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:43,439
Finished

16
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:44,919
I forgot my wallet at the front desk.

17
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:46,759
Why don't you get it for me?

18
00:02:46,759 --> 00:02:47,840
I can make a call for you.

19
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:48,400
No need.

20
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,400
I'll do it myself.

21
00:02:50,599 --> 00:02:51,479
Come on.

22
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:52,240
Xuan Yi.

23
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,360
Eat more vegetables and be healthy.

24
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:55,199
President Chen.

25
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:57,840
This dish is called a mess.

26
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:58,680
With vinegar.

27
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,479
It tastes better.

28
00:03:00,039 --> 00:03:02,520
The name of this dish is so special.

29
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,199
Why don't you try it?

30
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:04,960
I'll take care of it.

31
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,759
And the taste is very special.

32
00:03:15,159 --> 00:03:15,680
Mingzhe

33
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,560
You can have a look.

34
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:19,120
Is there anything else nearby?

35
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,759
The features we didn't find.

36
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,599
It's so messy.

37
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:23,599
Okay, President Chen.

38
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:25,159
Mr. Luo,

39
00:03:25,159 --> 00:03:27,039
Why don't you try it with vinegar?

40
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,199
Don't bother.

41
00:03:29,879 --> 00:03:31,120
I don't like to be jealous.

42
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:35,439
Who is it?

43
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:40,800
Who is it?

44
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:44,599
What are you doing?

45
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:45,919
Let's talk about it.

46
00:03:47,719 --> 00:03:48,599
What do you want?

47
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:49,960
I'm calling someone.

48
00:03:51,639 --> 00:03:52,800
You are actors.

49
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:55,120
Act well when you have a show.

50
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,719
Don't focus on the camera.

51
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,439
Who are you?

52
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,479
Assistant Assistant

53
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,840
It's useless to call anyone.

54
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:05,800
You don't respect yourself.

55
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,520
There's no more acting.

56
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,680
It's too late to regret.

57
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:13,439
Come back.

58
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,840
I have a crazy person here.

59
00:04:18,879 --> 00:04:19,519
Are we there?

60
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:20,519
Come in.

61
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,360
These ones here

62
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,360
It's a custom-made meal from Long Hao Hotel.

63
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:31,120
Every meal you have on the crew from now on,

64
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,240
Long Hao Hotel has it all.

65
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:33,839
you

66
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:35,360
Who are you?

67
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:42,480
Take care of your job.

68
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,240
Don't make things difficult for the assistant director.

69
00:04:49,079 --> 00:04:49,480
Loong

70
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,279
Young Master Long.

71
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,199
This is experiencing life.

72
00:04:55,319 --> 00:04:55,759
No

73
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,199
Which assistant director?

74
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,959
President Chen, it's not easy.

75
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:05,519
It seems that the difficulty of the game will be upgraded.

76
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:06,399
Mr. Luo,

77
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:07,279
You're wrong.

78
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,439
President Chen has

79
00:05:08,439 --> 00:05:09,879
Professional archery certificate.

80
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,000
The difficulty of the game can't be.

81
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,319
She is the standard of the game.

82
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:14,319
Really?

83
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,560
that

84
00:05:17,879 --> 00:05:18,959
Secretary Zhao, try it.

85
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:22,000
It's better to ask Master Kitano to give it a try.

86
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:24,920
good

87
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:26,519
I'll embarrass myself.

88
00:05:55,639 --> 00:05:56,439
It seems

89
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:58,240
I'm not suitable for the standard of games.

90
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,439
I didn't expect Master Kitano

91
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,079
You're so good at shooting arrows.

92
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,399
Display one's slight skill before an expert

93
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:05,439
Hobby

94
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,839
Mr. Luo, I'll try.

95
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:19,839
Zhao Mingzhe.

96
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,959
You're really secretive.

97
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:22,920
Because you like

98
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,079
So I learned a little.

99
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,800
Get ready.

100
00:06:37,319 --> 00:06:38,120
director

101
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,160
The actors are all fine.

102
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:40,120
director

103
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,000
This side of the scene can be used.

104
00:06:41,399 --> 00:06:42,000
Alright.

105
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:43,600
Dong-wook has adjusted.

106
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:44,480
All right.

107
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,160
I have no problem.

108
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,079
Listen to the director.

109
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,399
Alright.

110
00:06:47,399 --> 00:06:48,399
Prepare for the shooting.

111
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:49,560
Brother Xu, thank you for your hard work.

112
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,160
Mr. Dong-wook, this way.

113
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,279
Please go first.

114
00:06:52,279 --> 00:06:52,879
please

115
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:54,560
Director, I'm going.

116
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,240
good

117
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:58,240
Attention, all departments.

118
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,839
Okay. Come to the scene and prepare for the shooting.

119
00:07:01,079 --> 00:07:01,879
It's taken.

120
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:02,639
I'm ready.

121
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,319
Sure, Second Brother Long.

122
00:07:04,519 --> 00:07:05,480
That's it.

123
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:06,839
You're amazing.

124
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,199
Of course.

125
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,240
Who am I?

126
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,000
Long Yi.

127
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:15,360
I

128
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:17,680
Stop shooting.

129
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,040
Don't film me.

130
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,000
You're still shooting?

131
00:07:21,519 --> 00:07:22,839
You're here to shoot.

132
00:07:22,839 --> 00:07:23,519
I'm ready.

133
00:07:24,519 --> 00:07:25,560
Get set

134
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:27,959
Watch these.

135
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,600
then

136
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,680
Don't delay these projects.

137
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:32,439
to give to charity

138
00:07:32,839 --> 00:07:33,600
Go back to your work.

139
00:07:33,959 --> 00:07:35,040
Okay, let's go to work.

140
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:41,720
Secretary Zhao.

141
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:42,680
I'm busy.

142
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,079
President Luo, what's wrong?

143
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:46,680
It's no big deal.

144
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:47,759
Namely

145
00:07:48,399 --> 00:07:49,199
Let me ask you something.

146
00:07:49,519 --> 00:07:52,439
Do you know the size of an island?

147
00:07:52,439 --> 00:07:53,519
How to measure it?

148
00:07:54,519 --> 00:07:55,360
Island area

149
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,000
And the girth.

150
00:07:57,959 --> 00:08:00,560
And the growth of vegetation on the island.

151
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,160
And accurate mapping of terrain.

152
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,360
It's me.

153
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:06,040
I have a great idea.

154
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,360
You want to rely on an island,

155
00:08:07,519 --> 00:08:08,959
To make a bold design.

156
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:10,319
Into the game.

157
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:11,759
Mr. Luo,

158
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:13,480
Which island do you want to measure?

159
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,079
Take that one.

160
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:17,040
What island?

161
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,000
That's Oblivion Island.

162
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,199
It was developed into a private island last year.

163
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:23,480
The left front is the coral island.

164
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,800
The commercialization is very mature.

165
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:26,199
That's Nanfeng Island.

166
00:08:27,519 --> 00:08:28,680
Nanfeng Island.

167
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:29,800
What about the island?

168
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:30,560
Are you familiar with that island?

169
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,480
That island.

170
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,320
That island.

171
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,559
That island is uninhabited.

172
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:35,879
No one has been there yet.

173
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,159
Nobody's Island.

174
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,360
perfect

Are you going alone?

181

I have no one to accompany me.

00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,639
Ask your boss to give you a raise.

Let Secretary Zhao go alone.

193
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:33,399
It's not good.

194
00:09:34,639 --> 00:09:36,559
President Chen asked you to go by yourself.

195

Don't waste power.

That's right.

225

Don't worry about him.

226

You can't say that you're suffering.

300
00:14:23,919 --> 00:14:25,519
Isn't this creating?

The crew saw it.

312

I haven't held you for a day.

Thank you, honey.

314

All right.

00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:17,200
Someone will see it later.

00:15:17,799 --> 00:15:19,120
Find a place to rest for a while.

318
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:20,879
The crew is like this.

319
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,200
What about you?

320
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:24,559
I have a lot of work to do.

321
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:27,000
You'll go straight home after you finish shooting.

322
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,240
Don't suffer here.

323
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:30,519
You know it's suffering. Why are you doing it?

00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:00,000
This one.

349
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:02,080
Is definitely better than

350
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,960
The aged flower sculptures you drank with your father.

351
00:17:04,119 --> 00:17:06,240
But I bought it from Shaoxing.

352
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:07,480
It's still inside.

353
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:09,119
Your favorite Cixi arbutus.

354
00:17:11,799 --> 00:17:12,160
Correct!

355
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:14,160
The shrimp and crab

356
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:16,839
Are made with the freshest ingredients.

357
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:21,079
Dad

358
00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:22,480
Can you catch fish?

359
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:23,440
Of course I can.

360
00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:25,440
Let's eat.

361
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:26,200
Go to your mother.

362
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:27,079
good

363
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:31,839
Mom

364
00:17:31,839 --> 00:17:32,960
What is this?

365
00:17:33,319 --> 00:17:35,039
This is fish soup.

366
00:17:35,359 --> 00:17:36,240
Take a look.

367
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:38,000
Very delicious fish soup.

368
00:17:38,519 --> 00:17:39,480
How about this?

369
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:41,920
This is yellow wine.

370
00:17:42,079 --> 00:17:43,079
I made it for my dad.

371
00:17:43,599 --> 00:17:44,720
Take a look.

372
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:46,960
It's like this.

373
00:17:48,039 --> 00:17:50,240
The yellow wine is really yellow.

374
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,359
That's right.

375
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:51,839
come

376
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:54,960
The taste is still sweet.

377
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:57,440
Mom

378
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,000
I want to eat this shrimp.

379
00:17:59,119 --> 00:17:59,920
OK

380
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:01,039
Please wait a moment.

381
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,799
Let's wait for Dad to join us, okay?

382
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:03,519
good

383
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:10,440
This plate of peanuts is amazing.

384
00:18:10,759 --> 00:18:13,000
I cooked this in the kitchen myself.

385
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:15,440
Luo Beichen.

386
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:18,119
Why am I suddenly afraid of you?

387
00:18:19,279 --> 00:18:20,079
Afraid of me.

388
00:18:22,359 --> 00:18:23,160
I'm afraid it's poisonous.

389
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,640
Where did you learn that?

390
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,960
You drank three cups of arbutus flower carving.

391
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:31,839
I'll tell you.

392
00:18:35,599 --> 00:18:36,480
Let's do it first.

393
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:41,960
It's not poisonous.

394
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,519
Alright, Xudong. Hang in there.

395
00:18:49,799 --> 00:18:50,359
good

396

Stay in shape.

397
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:00,359
Continue

398
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,079
Continue

399
00:19:03,599 --> 00:19:06,079
Hold on.

400
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:08,839
Carbazole

401
00:19:09,359 --> 00:19:10,039
This one is over.

402
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,480
This is not easy.

403
00:19:17,799 --> 00:19:18,480
wife

404
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,759
You have a beautiful smile.

405
00:19:21,359 --> 00:19:22,039
husband

406

Thank you for being here.

407
00:19:26,279 --> 00:19:26,960
Did you read it just now?

408
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:27,400
Xudong

409
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:28,880
That was a good one.

410
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,079
You're so emotional.

411
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:30,839
second brother

412
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,799
Call me when it's time.

413
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,119
It's perfect.

414
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,039
You acted so well.

415
00:19:36,039 --> 00:19:37,079
That's right.

416
00:19:37,079 --> 00:19:37,839
Brother

417
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,160
You're good at it.

418
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:41,119
How about you do me a favor?

419
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:49,759
The waxberry flower carving is really delicious.

420
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:52,599
in one's childhood

421
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,680
My mother often took me to my grandma's house.

422
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:57,319
Grandma has a big arbutus garden.

423
00:19:57,799 --> 00:19:59,519
The winery is behind the Arbutus Garden.

424
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,559
I've smelled it since I was little.

425
00:20:01,559 --> 00:20:03,640
The taste of red bayberry and yellow wine.

426
00:20:07,279 --> 00:20:10,599
I heard that women in Jiangnan are gentle and beautiful.

427
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:14,200
You must be as pretty as me.

428
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:17,279
I have no idea

429
00:20:18,359 --> 00:20:19,920
Since my father passed away,

430
00:20:20,599 --> 00:20:21,599
So I left.

431
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,160
I was sent to Australia by my grandfather.

432
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:26,799
We haven't seen each other for many years.

433
00:20:28,279 --> 00:20:30,279
I can't remember what she looks like.

434
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:43,359
Chen Xuanyi

435
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:46,039
I will never leave you.

436
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,119
Luo Beichen.

437
00:21:12,119 --> 00:21:13,039
Luo Beichen.

438
00:21:18,359 --> 00:21:18,920
That's good.

439
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:21,920
Get ready for the next one.

440
00:21:22,359 --> 00:21:22,799
Yiyi.

441
00:21:23,079 --> 00:21:23,920
Second Brother is injured.

442
00:21:24,599 --> 00:21:25,279
second brother

443
00:21:25,279 --> 00:21:27,079
Long Er was injured just now.

444
00:21:28,359 --> 00:21:28,799
Where is it?

445
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:29,440
Hurry up.

446
00:21:31,119 --> 00:21:31,960
Where is he?

447
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:44,440
Where is Long Er?

448
00:21:45,519 --> 00:21:46,799
Sorry, Yiyi.

449
00:21:48,519 --> 00:21:50,000
I'm with them.

450
00:21:52,839 --> 00:21:53,640
Brothers,

451
00:21:53,839 --> 00:21:55,920
You look good.

452
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,240
Can you be my wife?

453
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,640
Sure.

454
00:22:00,599 --> 00:22:01,119
No

455
00:22:01,599 --> 00:22:04,440
You haven't acted enough during the day.

456
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:05,640
Are you still acting there?

457
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:07,559
Where is Long Er?

458
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:09,000
Let go of that girl.

459
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:23,400
Let me do it.

460
00:22:32,359 --> 00:22:33,079
today

461
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:37,720
Thank you for your kindness.

462
00:22:38,519 --> 00:22:41,400
We'll meet again in the future.

463
00:22:42,599 --> 00:22:43,720
Goodbye, Jianghu.

464
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:44,799

465
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:53,400

Brother

470
00:23:01,519 --> 00:23:03,880
Do you think it can be done?

471
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:04,799
Of course I can.

472
00:23:05,279 --> 00:23:07,599
With Second Brother's body and talent,

473
00:23:08,039 --> 00:23:09,000
If I were Yiyi,

474
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,319
I've fallen in love with him.
