1
00:02:17,439 --> 00:02:18,000
here

2
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:18,719
Liu Gong

3
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,919
There should be no problem with the time limit, Xuan Yi.

4
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,400
Is ahead of schedule.

5
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,719
I'm sure it's no problem to finish it on time.

6
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:24,800
Thank you for your hard work.

7
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:26,319
I've prepared lunch for you.

8
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,439
Take your brothers to eat.

9
00:02:27,639 --> 00:02:28,120
On the main island.

10
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:29,439
Thank you, President Chen.

11
00:02:29,719 --> 00:02:30,680
Brothers, let's eat.

12
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:32,639
Let's go.

13
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:33,400
Xuan Yi.

14
00:02:35,919 --> 00:02:36,919
I was wrong.

15
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:39,360
I really didn't expect that

16
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,080
His boat can be damaged, right?

17
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:41,960
Really

18
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,520
Otherwise, I wouldn't have done that to him.

19
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:43,919
Really

20
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:47,560
Forgive me, Xuan Yi.

21
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,840
You won't ignore me forever, right?

22
00:02:52,919 --> 00:02:54,159
Aren't you here to inspect the construction site?

23
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:58,520
Yes?

24
00:02:58,639 --> 00:02:59,360
You want to follow me?

25
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,199
I want to do it again.

26
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:02,080
first

27
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,479
This is Zhang Jingmei and Long Yi.

28
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:05,680
The wedding project.

29
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,800
I was entrusted by Aunt Yang.

30
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:08,599
Come and have a look.

31
00:03:08,599 --> 00:03:09,879
It has nothing to do with work.

32
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,199
It has nothing to do with you.

33
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,319
I know.

34
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,000
That

35
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:14,520
second

36
00:03:15,159 --> 00:03:16,560
You seem to be the one who should apologize.

37
00:03:17,479 --> 00:03:17,960
It's not me.

38
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:18,280
I

39
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:19,479
Xuan Yi.

40
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,439
It's finally done.

41
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:37,319
The garbage hasn't been emptied yet.

42
00:03:38,039 --> 00:03:38,599
Yes

43
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,840
We have to sort the garbage.

44
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:46,319
husband

45
00:03:46,639 --> 00:03:49,120
I have to go to the crew early tomorrow morning.

46
00:03:54,919 --> 00:03:56,039
In that case,

47
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,120
I'll sort them.

48
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,319
classification

49
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,439
No, wife.

50
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:12,120
wife

51
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:17,839
wife

52
00:04:55,639 --> 00:04:56,759
Honey, where are you going?

53
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:57,399
husband

54
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,759
I'm rushing to the crew. It's too late.

55
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,120
Find something to do.

56
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:01,360
Remember to eat breakfast.

57
00:05:20,519 --> 00:05:21,639
I'm the only one left.

58
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:35,040
Is this really TV?

59
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,240
This is a sofa.

60
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:00,800
My mother!

61
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:02,560
This is for shoes.

62
00:06:03,079 --> 00:06:05,079
My mother!

63
00:06:23,399 --> 00:06:24,079
Jing Mei is not here.

64
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,920
I want to check the surrounding area.

65
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,759
Find yourself a business.

66
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:32,000
This...

67
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,279
Thank you, boss.

68
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:37,160
Boss

69
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:38,040
Give me one too.

70
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:41,240
500 a day.

71
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:43,399
15,000 yuan a month.

72
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:48,519
Even if you earn two yuan,

73
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,480
Only 30,000 yuan a month.

74
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,360
Only 360,000 yuan a year.

75
00:06:57,519 --> 00:06:59,199
I've been working for a year.

76
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:07,000
Please take your milk tea.

77
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:09,600
Your milk tea.

78
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,079
Take a picture.

79
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:11,079
Your red bean honey snow.

80
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:12,480
Thank you

81
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,000
you're welcome

82
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:14,399
If you like, come here often.

83
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:16,800
very small

84
00:07:18,279 --> 00:07:19,279
one's master's/teacher's son who is older than oneself

85
00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:20,240
Your business is good.

86
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,240
Sit down.

87
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,480
What do you want to drink? It's my treat.

88
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,399
No, please.

89
00:07:24,399 --> 00:07:26,319
I'm here to support you.

90
00:07:27,519 --> 00:07:27,959
Xiaoyoul

91
00:07:29,079 --> 00:07:29,759
Please.

92
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:33,000
One hundred signature grapefruit milk tea to go.

93
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,240
one's master's/teacher's son who is older than oneself

94
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:37,360
You're too kind.

95
00:07:37,879 --> 00:07:39,000
Are my own people.

96
00:07:40,439 --> 00:07:41,600
Why do I feel

97
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,759
You're not here to support me.

98
00:07:45,079 --> 00:07:46,399
Jing Mei and Jia Lin

99
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:47,240
We'll be there soon.

100
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,040
Really?

101
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,199
When will it arrive?

102
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:52,000
Jing Mei came here from work.

103
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,160
Jia Lin will be there soon.

104
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:54,040
good

105
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,279
I'll make milk tea first.

106
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:00,720
a row

107
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,319
Get back to work.

108
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,079
Sit down.

109
00:08:02,079 --> 00:08:02,519
good

110
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,680
It's easy to do nothing.

111
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:11,519
Go to work.

112
00:08:12,279 --> 00:08:13,319
Long Chen Foundation

113
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:14,120
Not all over the world.

114
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,519
Are you looking for the game box?

115
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,519
Go and help Xuan Yi.

116
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:18,879
dad

117
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,399
I'm not doing that.

118
00:08:20,839 --> 00:08:21,680
to have no strength

119
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:22,759
What do you mean?

120
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:23,920
You don't think your position is too low.

121
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:25,759
No

122
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:27,519
Look.

123
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:29,040
The Omey Game Box

124
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:31,399
Without any passion.

125
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:32,879
I went to dry it.

126
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,000
I can't feel it.

127
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:34,919
Two, no power.

128
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:38,840
Can't improve my vitality.

129
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,440
Dad, do you understand?

130
00:08:40,759 --> 00:08:41,960
Vitality, Dad.

131
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:49,679
Hello, President Long.

132
00:08:51,559 --> 00:08:51,919
Hello

133
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:10,879
Why?

134
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,000
Reprint

135
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:13,679
I'll help you.

136
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:14,840
No, no.

137
00:09:15,039 --> 00:09:15,840
I'll help you.

138
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:16,360
I really don't need it.

139
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,200
You don't need President Long.

140
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:17,960
Thanks.

141
00:09:25,159 --> 00:09:26,039
this

142
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:36,799
That

143
00:09:38,799 --> 00:09:40,879
Everyone, thank you.

144
00:09:42,879 --> 00:09:44,639
Thank you, President Long.

145
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:48,159
Start a business?

146
00:10:48,159 --> 00:10:48,759
You're still young.

147
00:10:49,159 --> 00:10:50,000
It's easy to be frustrated.

148
00:10:50,279 --> 00:10:51,159
It will hurt your confidence.

149
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:55,080
The Long Group has so many industries.

150
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,600
Just pick one and practice.

151
00:10:57,399 --> 00:10:57,960
otherwise

152
00:10:58,279 --> 00:10:59,240
Why don't you play for two more years?

153
00:10:59,639 --> 00:11:00,320
A long experience.

154
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:02,360
dad

155
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,480
I'm done.

156
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,679
Go to work if you don't play.

157
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:10,039
Why did you come back?

158
00:11:10,039 --> 00:11:11,240
That's what Chen Xuanyi wants to do.

159
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,360
That's not what I want to do.

160
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,240
What's the difference?

161
00:11:14,679 --> 00:11:17,080
Is the property of the Long family.

162
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,600
Just go to work first.

163
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:20,559
have to

164
00:11:20,879 --> 00:11:21,879
I'm not telling you anymore.

165
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:23,799
Take leave

166
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,200
It's almost there.

167
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:33,360
He's here.

168
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:42,919
Hello, Meng.

169
00:11:44,759 --> 00:11:45,159
hello

170
00:11:45,879 --> 00:11:47,159
I'm a producer, Hao Shuai.

171
00:11:47,639 --> 00:11:48,279
Then what?

172
00:11:48,279 --> 00:11:49,919
Miss Xu told us

173
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,279
I'll prepare two suite for you.

174
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:51,759
Look.

175
00:11:51,759 --> 00:11:52,519
This is your room card.

176
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:53,840
Director Hao.

177
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,159
Is the hotel five-star?

178
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:57,320
Did you make a mistake?

179
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,159
This hotel has a radius of 10 kilometers.

180
00:12:00,159 --> 00:12:00,840
The best conditions.

181
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:04,039
Although the appearance is a bit ordinary,

182
00:12:04,039 --> 00:12:04,960
But the facilities are good.

183
00:12:05,399 --> 00:12:05,840
How about this?

184
00:12:06,039 --> 00:12:07,039
Go inside and have a look.

185
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:08,000
If you need anything,

186
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:08,720
And then tell me, okay?

187
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:09,080
come

188
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,120
Here's the thing, Director Hao.

189
00:12:10,919 --> 00:12:12,279
It's not because Miss Meng is picky.

190
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:14,320
It's her. She really hasn't lived here.

191
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,000
The hotel under five stars

192
00:12:16,919 --> 00:12:18,039
This condition.

193
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:20,039
I'm really afraid to disturb her rest.

194
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:21,919
If you don't rest well,

195
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:23,639
It won't affect the shooting.

196
00:12:24,799 --> 00:12:26,519
The crew has limited conditions.

197
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:27,480
Look at this.

198
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,039
Director Hao.

199
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:31,360
Don't make things difficult for Miss Meng.

200
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:32,240
this

201
00:12:34,159 --> 00:12:34,679
hello

202
00:12:34,679 --> 00:12:36,240
I'm the acting assistant director of this group.

203
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,000
Zhang Yiyi.

204
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:37,879
Hello

205
00:12:37,879 --> 00:12:39,159
You really have a good taste.

206
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:40,919
This hotel doesn't have five stars.

207
00:12:40,919 --> 00:12:41,919
Four stars at most.

208
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:44,360
But this hotel

209
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:46,080
With a five-star gym.

210
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:47,720
And an infinity pool.

211
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,559
We all know that Miss Meng

212
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,200
Is known as a sexy goddess.

213
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:54,440
So she must spend a lot of time

214
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,759
To manage the body.

215
00:12:55,919 --> 00:12:57,200
So our hotel

216
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,399
Was specially ordered for Miss Meng.

217
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:01,440
Do you want to ask Ms. Meng first?

218
00:13:01,559 --> 00:13:02,159
How about this?

219
00:13:02,159 --> 00:13:03,039
Let me ask Ms. Meng first.

220
00:13:03,039 --> 00:13:04,039
Okay, thank you.

221
00:13:04,039 --> 00:13:04,440
All right.

222
00:13:08,919 --> 00:13:09,320
Miss Meng.

223
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,000
They said the hotel is good.

224
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,000
I'm going to have a look.

225
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:17,720
Here's the thing.

226
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:18,480
Miss Meng said

227
00:13:18,679 --> 00:13:19,360
Go inside.

228
00:13:19,759 --> 00:13:20,159
Really?

229
00:13:20,159 --> 00:13:20,519
Alright.

230
00:13:20,519 --> 00:13:20,799
come

231
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:21,519
This way. This side.

232
00:13:21,679 --> 00:13:22,240
Come on.

233
00:13:34,039 --> 00:13:35,200
Eat your horse.

234
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:36,799
general

235
00:13:36,799 --> 00:13:37,279
grandpa

236
00:13:37,759 --> 00:13:39,360
When did the car come here?

237
00:13:40,159 --> 00:13:41,799
Don't transfer the target to me.

238
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,320
Didn't you say you wanted to start a business?

239
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:46,519
Yes?

240
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:49,159
I just earned 100 yuan.

241
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,559
Even the Long Group can't be trusted.

242
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:53,200
How could I, Grandpa?

243
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,480
I just want to see myself.

244
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:56,559
Can we do anything else?

245
00:13:59,559 --> 00:14:00,360
Then I'll...

246
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,080
corporal

247
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:04,799
will

248
00:14:05,559 --> 00:14:06,879
Then what do you want to do?

249
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:12,279
I don't know what I can do.

250
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:15,679
grandpa

251
00:14:16,279 --> 00:14:17,799
Am I dead?

252
00:14:19,159 --> 00:14:20,320
Isn't it dead?

253
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,600
There's no overall plan.

254
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,799
There's no strategy.

255
00:14:24,799 --> 00:14:25,960
There's no target.

256
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:28,120
Who will lose if you don't lose?

257
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:31,759
What are you waiting for?

258
00:14:31,759 --> 00:14:33,000
The losing chess.

259
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:33,960
This is the rule.

260
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,000
Remember,

261
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,919
How about playing chess?

262
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,440
Take the first step.

263
00:14:39,799 --> 00:14:40,639
The head gun.

264
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:43,840
Why?

265
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,519
Because it can be attacked and guarded.

266
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:48,639
It's like doing business.

267
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,039
I don't want to earn a lot.

268
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:52,799
You should seek compensation first.

269
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:01,000
Jialin

270
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:01,679
Jialin

271
00:15:02,279 --> 00:15:02,799
Jialin

272
00:15:03,559 --> 00:15:04,000
Yu Qiu.

273
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,080
You can't understand Chinese, right?

274
00:15:05,559 --> 00:15:06,639
We broke up.

275
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:07,600
Break up, understand?

276
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:08,799
I

277
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:09,720
Jialin, Jiallin.

278
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:11,879
I know you're angry.

279
00:15:11,879 --> 00:15:13,039
But listen to me.

280
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,200
We've been in love for so many years.

281
00:15:14,519 --> 00:15:16,159
You have to give me a chance to explain.

282
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:16,879
good

283
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:17,960
Explain.

284
00:15:18,919 --> 00:15:19,279
come

285
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:20,759
Go ahead.

286
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:21,519
I

287
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:24,720
Are you finished?

288
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:25,720
No, no.

289
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:28,639
I love you, Jialin.

290
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Since the first time I met you,

291
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:30,799
I fell in love with you.

292
00:15:30,799 --> 00:15:31,600
For so many years,

293
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,559
So many times.

294
00:15:32,559 --> 00:15:33,440
But I still love you.

295
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,519
I've never changed my mind.

296
00:15:34,519 --> 00:15:35,080
I used to love

297
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:35,480
Love now.

298
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:36,080
I will love you in the future.

299
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,440
Please trust me.

300
00:15:42,039 --> 00:15:42,559
Then what?

301
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:44,960
then

302
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:46,200
Besides me,

303
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,200
Who will you always love?

304
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:48,080
I

305
00:15:49,639 --> 00:15:50,519
I only love you.

306
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:51,519
Really?

307
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,639
What's your problem?

308
00:15:53,639 --> 00:15:54,840
You're only doing it for me.

309
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:56,559
I've never made it for others.

310
00:15:56,879 --> 00:15:58,000
Brother Yu Hao Qiu.

311
00:15:59,799 --> 00:16:00,200
I

312
00:16:21,399 --> 00:16:21,799
younger sister

313
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:22,600
What about

314
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:23,039
Brother

315
00:16:23,559 --> 00:16:25,600
I spent a whole night on this color.

316
00:16:25,919 --> 00:16:27,919
The effect is assigned to the cow.

317
00:16:27,919 --> 00:16:28,399
Yes

318
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:29,840
I think it's really good.

319
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:31,200
But brother,

320
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:35,000
The director wants to act in ten groups.

321
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:36,639
Look at this.

322
00:16:37,159 --> 00:16:37,799
Ten?

323
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:38,840
Yes

324
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:39,720
It's all right.

325
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:40,720
Ten or eight are almost the same.

326
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,559
The director asked for ten.

327
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,320
I don't think it can stand down.

328
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,120
This is the distant background.

329
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,080
For more than three seconds.

330
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,440
The camera will pass.

331
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:53,360
Eight people is enough.

332
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:54,840
Brother

333
00:16:55,159 --> 00:16:57,480
I think the director asked for 12 meters.

334
00:16:58,039 --> 00:17:00,120
I don't think this is enough.

335
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,960
You can't tell from the distance.

336
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,080
Director, that's

337
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:05,200
Is a rough value.

338
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,920
We have to consider the cost, right?

339
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,200
There are only two people here.

340
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:09,920
Your cost is also lower.

341
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:12,160
But we have to ensure the quality of the director's lens.

342
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,160
Don't be so anxious

343
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,319
The film is ruined, right?

344
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:17,119
Yiyi.

345
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:20,279
Do you know that the background board is painted completely?

346
00:17:20,279 --> 00:17:21,160
How many meters are you adding?

347
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,720
The whole thing has to be changed and redone.

348
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:23,440
Besides,

349
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:24,279
This is the only shot.

350
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:25,720
How can it be bad?

351
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:26,440
Almost there.

352
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,079
If every scene

353
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:29,079
You've fooled me.

354
00:17:29,359 --> 00:17:31,000
Can we still watch this?

355
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:32,319
Brother

356
00:17:32,319 --> 00:17:33,400
Just a few more meters.

357
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:34,440
Really.

358
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,759
An actress and assistant director.

359
00:17:36,759 --> 00:17:38,039
Why do you care so much?

360
00:17:38,319 --> 00:17:40,279
I'll take it as a promise.

361
00:17:40,279 --> 00:17:41,440
I'll talk to the director again.

362
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,559
Coordinate the time.

363
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:43,680
Give you more time.

364
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:44,759
Please finish this.

365
00:17:44,759 --> 00:17:45,599
Brother, thank you for your hard work.

366
00:17:46,279 --> 00:17:46,720
No

367
00:20:00,279 --> 00:20:01,319
Hello, honey.

368
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:02,880
Honey, where are you?

369
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:03,880
I've arrived downstairs.

370
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:04,799
Alright.

371
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:05,359
I'll be waiting for you.

372
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:06,640
Is there any food at home?

373
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:07,759
I'm so hungry.

374
00:20:08,079 --> 00:20:08,799
Come back first.

375
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:19,519
husband

376
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:22,759
husband

377
00:20:27,799 --> 00:20:28,400
wife

378
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:29,759
Welcome home.

379
00:20:31,559 --> 00:20:32,960
What are you doing?

380
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:45,039
Please have a seat.

381
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:46,880
When did you do that?

382
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:34,400
This is amazing. Tonight.

383
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:42,720
Eat.

384
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:49,680
Is it delicious?

385
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:52,599
It's delicious.

386
00:21:52,599 --> 00:21:53,759
It's a little small.

387
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,079
One more.

388
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:57,119
Anything else?

389
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:57,799
steak

390
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:01,119
No more.

391
00:22:02,079 --> 00:22:03,720
But my wife

392
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:06,200
Can we do this business?

393
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:08,720
What business?

394
00:22:09,599 --> 00:22:10,559
Takeout?

395
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,359
Everyone is ordering takeout now.

396
00:22:13,799 --> 00:22:14,880
Look at my takeout.

397
00:22:15,279 --> 00:22:16,599
Is it special?

398
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:17,640
Special market

399
00:22:17,839 --> 00:22:18,759
You still want to eat.

400
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,759
Then I want to know about your takeout.

401
00:22:22,759 --> 00:22:23,839
How much is it?

402
00:22:25,599 --> 00:22:27,119
To be conservative,

403
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:30,440
The cost is over 2,000 yuan.

404
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:31,480
With the performance,

405
00:22:32,279 --> 00:22:32,960
Long Yi.

406
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:36,000
Please understand it now.

407
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:37,119
Who ordered takeout.

408
00:22:37,119 --> 00:22:38,880
How much can I spend a day now?

409
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,599
Young master,

410
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,519
Twenty or thirty.

411
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,119
It's too hasty.
