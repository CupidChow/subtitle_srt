Last month.

Yeah.

No, no, no.

Listen to me,

178
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,150
That's impossible.

179
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,150
It's not true.

180
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:36,740
It must be an illusion.

you dare to trick me into getting married?

then what?

303
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:57,830
How can I use my hand?

push it down a little bit,

don't listen to his nonsense.

311

Annoying.

Where are we going?

319
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:37,840
Is this true?

320
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:38,550
It's fake, right?

321
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:39,930
-Fake evidence. -Open

322
00:14:39,930 --> 00:14:40,690
your eyes.

323
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:43,030
You've never seen the world. Look,

324
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:45,500
this is a legal document

325
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:46,850
of the People's Republic of China.

326
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:49,640
I don't know if it's legal.

327
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:51,380
Then why is it bull's eye?

328
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:53,550
Because the bull's eye is big.

329
00:14:57,290 --> 00:14:58,820
How can you be in a relationship?

330
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:00,430
You even put yourself in it.

331
00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:02,480
You are such a young man,

332
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:04,390
yet you got married so young.

333
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:08,070
To celebrate your early marriage in Younian,

334
00:15:10,030 --> 00:15:11,440
let's go out for a trip.

335
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:12,750
Cut the crap!

336
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:15,000
I'm telling you now,

337
00:15:15,770 --> 00:15:17,380
I have a family,

338
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:20,200
Don't keep fooling around with me.

339
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,680
You really have the self-cultivation of a married man.

340
00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:28,440
Where are you going on your honeymoon?

341
00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:31,500
Let's go together.

342
00:15:32,050 --> 00:15:34,500
I won't take you with me wherever I go.

343
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:36,250
You're overthinking it.

344
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:38,760
To be honest,

345
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:40,320
how about we celebrate it?

346
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:52,940
(Abroad).

347
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:00,310
President Chen,

348
00:16:00,310 --> 00:16:01,520
on your birthday next month,

349
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:02,500
Do I need to book a flight

350
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:03,240
back home for you in advance?

351
00:16:03,610 --> 00:16:04,240
No rush.

352
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:06,240
Let's talk about it with Grandpa,

353
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:07,130
Mr. Chen,

354
00:16:07,430 --> 00:16:08,380
The accounts of Alpha Hotel

355
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:09,220
have been sorted out.

356
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,220
We can hand it over at any time.

357
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:13,410
Okay,

358
00:16:14,370 --> 00:16:15,340
Inform Uncle.

359
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:18,490
Mr. Chen,

360
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:20,080
are you really willing

361
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,120
to give up the hotel

362
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:21,780
you built yourself?

363
00:16:25,090 --> 00:16:27,020
I don't mind being in charge of it for a few days.

364
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:29,400
It's mine. It's mine sooner or later.

365
00:16:35,130 --> 00:16:35,960
Suddenly,

366
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:38,070
I really want to eat cake from Alpha Hotel.

367
00:16:38,850 --> 00:16:39,980
It's ready for you.

368
00:16:51,990 --> 00:16:52,770
Luo Beichen,

369
00:16:53,530 --> 00:16:55,780
what does it have to do with me

370
00:16:57,950 --> 00:16:59,360
when you're more stingy than Yu Lang?

371
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,430
I bought it all by myself.

372
00:17:02,850 --> 00:17:04,130
It has nothing to do with him.

373
00:17:04,770 --> 00:17:05,880
Brother,

374
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:08,590
at least I'm married,

375
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:10,920
Can you give it to the whole one?

376
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:13,550
This is Alpha Hotel's

377
00:17:13,550 --> 00:17:14,610
signature cake,

378
00:17:14,610 --> 00:17:15,680
Limited?

379
00:17:15,970 --> 00:17:17,180
It's just a tiny bit of

380
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:20,340
VVVVIP, okay?

381
00:17:20,690 --> 00:17:22,710
VVVVIP.

382
00:17:23,670 --> 00:17:24,510
Tell me,

383
00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:25,600
where should I start?

384
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,950
There's Jingmei.

385
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:46,150
He can come whenever he wants.

386
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:47,380
If you don't want to come, you won't come.

387
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:49,160
At least tell me in advance.

388
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:50,960
My gold card members are waiting here.

389
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:52,450
A famous coach is great.

390
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:53,960
I don't care.

391
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:56,070
No matter what, within half an hour,

392
00:17:56,510 --> 00:17:57,720
get me a gold coach.

393
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:01,840
Why are you still following me?

394
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:03,670
I can't film it.

395
00:18:03,670 --> 00:18:04,840
They are all VVIPs.

396
00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:06,380
I won't be able to delay it for a day.

397
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:07,200
Manager Li,

398
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:07,820
didn't Director Liu

399
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:09,070
make a deal with you?

400
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:11,640
The star of our play is Deng Manfei,

401
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:13,200
who has her own stream.

402
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,000
Think about it,

403
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,450
when she comes to work out here,

404
00:18:15,450 --> 00:18:17,790
Didn't you even save the advertising fee?

405
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:19,030
I still need to shoot.

406
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:21,440
These stars are my members.

407
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:22,660
-Yes, yes, yes. -Manager.

408
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:23,840
Manager,

409
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:24,560
Manager,

410
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:25,570
Enqi has arrived.

411
00:18:25,570 --> 00:18:26,420
I'm getting changed.

412
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:28,270
Where you used to work,

413
00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:30,310
did you have a good Taekwondo instructor?

414
00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:31,840
Bring him to the rescue site.

415
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:33,110
I used to know

416
00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:34,310
some junior coaches.

417
00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:35,540
As far as Enqi is concerned,

418
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:36,880
she must have tried it out with just one kick.

419
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:39,460
Manager,

420
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,580
are you looking for Taekwondo instructor?

421
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:43,970
You can solve it?

422
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:46,290
If I can solve your problem,

423
00:18:46,650 --> 00:18:48,330
will you be able to solve mine?

424
00:18:48,330 --> 00:18:49,840
As long as you solve my problem,

425
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,450
your problem won't be a problem.

426
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:12,540
(Liang Siqi is a popular actress in China).

427
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:27,190
You're the new coach.

428
00:19:27,730 --> 00:19:28,160
Yes.

429
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:40,220
Come back.

430
00:19:42,910 --> 00:19:43,800
I'm sorry,

431
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:44,850
sister. I didn't mean to.

432
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:46,120
I was just doing it instinctively

433
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:48,920
Hello, Coach,

434
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:51,970
Hello.

435
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:56,370
Aunt Huang,

436
00:19:56,370 --> 00:19:56,960
Aunt Huang,

437
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:00,920
You bought so many things,

438
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:04,750
red dates, peanuts, longan, lotus seeds,

439
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:05,580
Who's getting married?

440
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:06,370
No one's getting married.

441
00:20:06,370 --> 00:20:07,370
I asked him to buy it.

442
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:09,330
Okay,

443
00:20:09,330 --> 00:20:10,230
I'll put it in the kitchen.

444
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:10,920
I'll cook porridge later.

445
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:12,080
All right, all right. Just

446
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:12,520
leave it to me.

447
00:20:13,150 --> 00:20:13,580
Brother,

448
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:15,740
Let's help you.

449
00:20:16,530 --> 00:20:17,030
No need

450
00:20:18,410 --> 00:20:19,150
Give it to me, Auntie Huang. -Okay. -Put

451
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:22,220
it away.

452
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:23,810
You two beat up this balloon.

453
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:29,100
Balloon,

454
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:30,560
Gosh

455
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:31,860
Why is Togo

456
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:36,280
working so hard all of a sudden?

457
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:39,060
He must have been stimulated.

458
00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:44,500
Don't follow me.

459
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:45,370
Okay, okay.

460
00:20:48,710 --> 00:20:49,770
It must be because sister-in-law

461
00:20:51,910 --> 00:20:53,240
didn't really break up, right?

462
00:20:55,990 --> 00:20:56,960
I'm not sure.

463
00:21:03,650 --> 00:21:04,200
Okay,

464
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:06,880
Practice the forward kick of the side leg.

465
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:07,370
Very good.

466
00:21:07,370 --> 00:21:07,770
Okay,

467
00:21:08,090 --> 00:21:08,470
Come on.

468
00:21:12,030 --> 00:21:13,460
Okay.

469
00:21:14,290 --> 00:21:15,250
Very good.

470
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:21,800
Coach,

471
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:23,200
can I add you on WeChat?

472
00:21:23,630 --> 00:21:24,320
Okay.

473
00:21:38,910 --> 00:21:39,960
Brother, are you okay?

474
00:21:40,370 --> 00:21:41,970
Are you going to tear down the house?

475
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,200
Don't come up.

476
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:00,670
What on earth is he busy with?

477
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,790
Two thousand yuan a day,

478
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:06,850
that's all I can talk about.

479
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,010
I took a look,

480
00:22:08,010 --> 00:22:10,080
and the environment of the gym is really good.

481
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,800
And the venue is very open.

482
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:12,890
I don't think a machine

483
00:22:12,890 --> 00:22:14,150
will be a problem.

484
00:22:14,510 --> 00:22:16,050
I'm sure the photos won't be bad.

485
00:22:16,530 --> 00:22:17,320
That's it then.

486
00:22:17,770 --> 00:22:18,810
Zhang Jingmei, right?

487
00:22:18,810 --> 00:22:19,680
Yes.

488
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:20,550
Go to the group next to you,

489
00:22:20,890 --> 00:22:21,640
and tell them,

490
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:22,580
For the scene they took today,

491
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:23,350
can you not retreat?

492
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:24,450
Let's grab a big night.

493
00:22:24,450 --> 00:22:25,300
Let's borrow it.

494
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:25,880
Okay,

495
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:27,170
Then I'll go, Director.

496
00:22:27,170 --> 00:22:27,540
Okay.

497
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,160
Two thousand yuan a day,

498
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:33,430
it's still easy for a girl to handle affairs.

499
00:22:33,430 --> 00:22:34,900
Keep an eye on the seats.

500
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:35,780
This girl is not bad.

501
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:36,880
She's a good material,

502
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:39,520
Zheng has a good taste.

503
00:22:44,170 --> 00:22:44,810
Hey,

504
00:22:45,150 --> 00:22:46,040
Haven't you finished yet?

505
00:22:46,630 --> 00:22:47,790
It's a long time ago.

506
00:22:47,790 --> 00:22:49,080
If you're sleepy, go to bed first.

507
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:50,000
Don't wait for me.

508
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:50,870
No way.

509
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:52,270
I have a surprise for you.

510
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:53,040
No matter how late it is,

511
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:54,270
let me know when you're done,
