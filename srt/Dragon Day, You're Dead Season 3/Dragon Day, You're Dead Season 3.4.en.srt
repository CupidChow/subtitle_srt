Wait for the phone to ring,

171
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:03,630
Shh.

172
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:05,360
Hey,

173
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:07,110
Master Sun,

174
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:10,100
let's go.

175
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:10,700
I'll be right there.

176
00:08:10,910 --> 00:08:12,280
Okay, wait for me. I'll go

177
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:13,790
to work later.

178
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:16,040
Where are you going to work again,

179
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,920
young master?

180
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:18,750
I might have been running

181
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:19,960
outside this afternoon.

182
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:20,820
Don't wait for me.

183
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,050
Let me see you off.

184
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:23,880
No, thanks.

185
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:25,040
If there's a car in the team,

186
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:27,810
thank you for visiting me today.

187
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:28,730
Go back now.

188
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:30,500
What time do you get off work?

189
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,570
I also prepared a surprise.

190
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:33,890
I'm not sure yet.

191
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:35,100
By the way,

192
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:35,940
when you leave later,

193
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:37,130
Remember to move the RV away.

194
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:38,410
It's too eye-catching.

195
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:43,790
I don't even ask what the surprise is.

196
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:45,260
(Long Yi: I had a great time visiting today. I hope my goddess goes well with her work. )

197
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:47,180
(The RV is really beautiful. )

198
00:08:55,090 --> 00:08:56,920
I caught a big fish,

199
00:08:57,860 --> 00:08:58,560
Jialin.

200
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,400
You have to help me figure out a way.

201
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:01,960
What is it?

202
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:04,380
The way to fire a couple with Deng Man Fei.

203
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:06,030
I don't think she'll need me anymore.

204
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:07,070
You like her so much?

205
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,040
Yes,

206
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,240
I like her. Is she hot?

207
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,440
You can set me on fire.

208
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:21,360
Enqi,

209
00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:22,770
I'm sorry I'm late.

210
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:23,960
I'm really sorry.

211
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:24,990
You're the only coach

212
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:26,080
who kept me waiting,

213
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:27,960
Half,

214
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,920
I'm half a coach at most,

215
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,050
You know,

216
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:32,230
the crew is like a battlefield,

217
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:33,560
I really can't leave. I can

218
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:34,610
stay with you today.

219
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:35,490
One more hour. One hour

220
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,640
is not enough.

221
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,370
It's not easy to ask you out,

222
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:40,250
so it's up to you.

223
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:41,640
Eat with me

224
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:42,960
after practice. Deal.

225
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:08,750
It's interesting.

226
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,140
Playing hard to get.

227
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:31,900
Sis,

228
00:10:32,890 --> 00:10:33,740
Sis, what's wrong with you?

229
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:34,430
What's wrong?

230
00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:34,850
Sis,

231
00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:35,640
Girl, what's going on?

232
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:36,240
Sis,

233
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:38,020
-What are you doing? -Get up.

234
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:38,720
-Get up, girl. -Get

235
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,600
up. -What's wrong? -Yes.

236
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,950
Sis, what's wrong with you? -Mom,

237
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:45,570
where's my bed? -Nose bleeding.

238
00:10:45,570 --> 00:10:46,580
Brother-in-law moved away.

239
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:48,420
He has a nosebleed.

240
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,450
I have a nosebleed.

241
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:50,240
I'll get the paper.

242
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,530
-Get the paper. -Hurry. The bed has

243
00:10:51,530 --> 00:10:53,380
been moved away. -Don't you

244
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:55,360
have a table? -Hurry up.

245
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,870
Long Yi has moved away.

246
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:58,320
Didn't he tell you?

247
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:02,660
Why didn't you stop him?

248
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:05,000
Brother-in-law said I have a surprise for you.

249
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,180
Right. Aren't you

250
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:08,330
both married?

251
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:12,190
That's right.

252
00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:13,920
Come on.

253
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:14,600
This one

254
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,490
Address.

255
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:20,610
Well,

256
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:23,750
I still have a dream to finish.

257
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:26,110
That's right.

258
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:28,530
Your mom and I are dreaming together.

259
00:11:31,810 --> 00:11:33,590
I also have a dream that I haven't finished.

260
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:34,520
I'll get going.

261
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:50,860
Long Yi,

262
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:52,860
you are dead then.

263
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,530
Surprise,

264
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:25,010
welcome your wife home.

265
00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:28,530
Long Yi,

266
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:30,530
where's my bed?

267
00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:33,430
Find a bed as soon as you get home,

268
00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:34,240
wife

269
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:36,070
You're bad.

270
00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:37,460
Who are you

271
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:48,040
to design this,

272
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:50,930
This decoration

273
00:12:50,930 --> 00:12:52,390
is not surprising.

274
00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:53,570
Are you surprised?

275
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:57,860
Dining room,

276
00:12:58,930 --> 00:13:01,250
living room,

277
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:03,550
where are you? And the garden,

278
00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:07,430
There's a swimming pool next to it,

279
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:08,920
and there's a terrace upstairs,

280
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:11,420
Don't you want to practice taekwondo at home?

281
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:14,170
I guarantee that you can practice anytime and anywhere every day.

282
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:17,560
It's so spacious and spacious,

283
00:13:17,770 --> 00:13:19,090
and most importantly,

284
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:20,800
There are only ten minutes left before the show.

285
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:22,620
So you can go home and sleep

286
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:24,030
after work every day.

287
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:26,620
Okay,

288
00:13:27,010 --> 00:13:30,020
Very close. Very close. Good.

289
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:30,880
Do you like it?

290
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:34,440
Yes,

291
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,680
I like it so much.

292
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:37,380
Long Yi,

293
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:39,140
you're amazing.

294
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:40,160
Honey,

295
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:42,650
do you want to go upstairs and have a look?

296
00:13:42,650 --> 00:13:43,420
No need.

297
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:44,800
The first floor of the scene is enough.

298
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:49,530
What scene?

299
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,740
For the scene that the crew wants to use,

300
00:13:52,130 --> 00:13:52,830
our group

301
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:54,270
only needs a view of the mansion.

302
00:13:55,630 --> 00:13:56,650
I didn't expect you

303
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:57,600
to give me

304
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,400
such a big surprise.

305
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,500
You're so kind.

306
00:14:02,090 --> 00:14:02,690
You know what?

307
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,640
This is the sense of design

308
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:06,580
that our director wants.

309
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:10,850
My aunt,

310
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:12,140
this is my new home.

311
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:13,640
How did it become a scene?

312
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:16,070
It's our new home.

313
00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:18,670
Can we use it for one day?

314
00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:19,570
No。

315
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:27,780
The crew has a budget.

316
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:29,260
No,

317
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:31,040
It's not about the budget. This

318
00:14:31,210 --> 00:14:33,820
… This is my new wife,

319
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:35,720
These are all newly bought,

320
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:37,780
how can they become a scene?

321
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:38,310
Got it.

322
00:14:38,650 --> 00:14:39,810
He won't let us suffer.

323
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:41,130
5. 1 Thousand God,

324
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,120
don't change the subject.

325
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:46,720
I haven't agreed yet.

326
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:47,590
How did it become money again?

327
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:49,210
No, Yi, look,

328
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:51,050
you can't earn money for nothing,

329
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:52,910
With such a big house,

330
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:54,760
the water, electricity and gas bill for one day,

331
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:55,530
How much will it cost?

332
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:57,240
You can't always rely on your family.

333
00:14:57,610 --> 00:14:58,760
You have to rely on yourself.

334
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:03,590
Got it.

335
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:09,640
Then you can't bear to see me

336
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:13,800
tired and backache to look for the scenery.

337
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:16,290
Well,

338
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:19,270
Then.

339
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:28,480
Should we add more lease terms?

No.

346
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:43,260
I told you not to talk about money.

347
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:44,770
Why are you talking about money again?

348
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:51,780
You didn't expect that, did you?

349
00:15:52,450 --> 00:15:53,600
I'm also here today.

350
00:15:58,010 --> 00:15:58,630
Deal.

351
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:14,520
Ho,

-This is okay. -This

354
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,300
isn't okay. -This,

355
00:16:20,070 --> 00:16:21,450
This is great.

356
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,450
This is the scene I want.

357
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:29,210
I'm sorry, Zhang.

358
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:30,270
No,

359
00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:31,500
I'm not denying your ability.

360
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:32,890
But don't you know

361
00:16:32,890 --> 00:16:34,090
how much budget we have?

362
00:16:34,090 --> 00:16:34,900
You're looking for such a house?

363
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:36,160
How are we going to shoot the rest of the scene?

364
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,130
It cannot exceed 10 thousand.

365
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:38,480
No more than 10 houses. Director,

366
00:16:38,810 --> 00:16:39,670
6. 1 houses days.

367
00:16:40,170 --> 00:16:40,640
How much is it?

00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:41,580
6. 1 thousand days,

369
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:42,540

house. -Okay,

373
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:47,970
I'll send someone to set up the scenery right away.

374
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:49,000
By the way,

375
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:50,630
sign the contract with the owner

376
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:52,860
and don't change your mind.

377
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:53,990
It's already signed, Director.

378
00:16:53,990 --> 00:16:54,800
Don't worry.

379
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:55,740
The contract has also been signed.

380
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:56,090
Yes.

381
00:16:56,430 --> 00:16:57,570
That's great, Zhang.

382
00:16:57,570 --> 00:16:58,160
That's great.

383
00:16:58,520 --> 00:16:59,280
Director,

384
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:00,660
I think this is good.

385
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:01,160
That's it.

386
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:02,080
I don't want you to think,

387
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:02,920
I want me to think,

388
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:03,940
Okay.

389
00:17:21,330 --> 00:17:22,240
Handsome guy,

390
00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:24,170
do you have time

391
00:17:24,170 --> 00:17:25,400
for dinner tonight?

392
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:26,840
Excuse me,

My wife will be here soon.

You have a strong survival instinct Mr. Long,

honey,

397
00:17:36,610 --> 00:17:39,510
Are you going to treat me to something delicious?

398
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:40,740
Order whatever you want.

399
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:57,030
I want a marcel fish soup.

400
00:17:57,410 --> 00:18:00,400
And then eggs, caviar,

401
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,040
and this,

402
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:04,000
-Braised vegetarian

403
00:18:04,390 --> 00:18:05,260
heart. -Okay,

404
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:06,900
One more of this.

405
00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:09,930
I'm done ordering.

406
00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:10,920
You order

407
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,160
I haven't decided yet.

408
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,770
I'll order it later.

409
00:18:17,770 --> 00:18:18,080
Okay,

410
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:19,290
Why don't you join mine first?

411
00:18:19,290 --> 00:18:19,840
I'm hungry.

412
00:18:20,050 --> 00:18:20,490
Okay,

413
00:18:21,170 --> 00:18:21,800
Long Yi,

414
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,240
this dish is too expensive.

415
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:26,450
You said you would treat me to a big meal.

416
00:18:26,450 --> 00:18:27,250
Do you want to go back on your word?

417
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:28,810
This meal is too big.

418
00:18:28,810 --> 00:18:30,440
We only have 6thousand yuan in total.

419
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:32,760
Do you also find that 6 thousand is too little?

420
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:35,280
Well,

421
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:38,080
we haven't decided yet,

422
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,670
We need to discuss it again.

423
00:18:39,670 --> 00:18:41,060
Okay. Call me when you're ready.

424
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:42,030
Okay. Thank you.

425
00:18:42,030 --> 00:18:42,480
Okay.

426
00:18:50,490 --> 00:18:51,260
What are you doing?

427
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:00,840
Mrs. Long,

429
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:05,660

You have everything you want.

431

Order whatever you want.

433
00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:12,540
Can't we order a good steak?

434
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:13,260

Four skewers of roasted kidney,

Okay.

Well,

443

do you have any serious meat here?

444
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:27,240
Sir,

445
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,850
the meat here is real meat.

446
00:19:28,850 --> 00:19:30,020
Where do you want to eat?

447
00:19:31,090 --> 00:19:33,810
I'm not talking about the normal meat, I … I mean the normal

448
00:19:33,810 --> 00:19:37,650
meat.

449
00:19:38,090 --> 00:19:39,800
20 kebabs of lamb kebabs, please.

450
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:40,520
Okay.

451
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:49,240
I don't know

452
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:51,240
who told me the day he got the certificate,

453
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:53,730
He will eat whatever I eat in the future.

454
00:19:55,430 --> 00:19:56,300
Me,

455
00:19:56,870 --> 00:19:57,960
Don't worry,

456
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,550
after today's meal,

457
00:19:59,550 --> 00:20:01,570
The rest of the money is yours.

458
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:07,660
Thank you, Party A's dad.

459
00:20:17,290 --> 00:20:18,420
That's great.

460
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:19,870
Mr. Ke,

461
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:22,550
thanks to your great help this time.

462
00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:23,920
Thank you so much.

463
00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:25,800
You're too kind.

464
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:26,800
It's all because of a single sentence

465
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,600
from our beautiful girl,

466
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:32,910
You and Jingmei used to be good friends.

467
00:20:32,910 --> 00:20:33,840
Of course.

468
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:35,760
We've known each other since school.

469
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:38,020
Jingmei is very capable,

470
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:39,350
a talented person

471
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:40,210
with a bright future.

472
00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:41,770
-Come on. -Let's smoke. Thank

473
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:42,970
you. I don't smoke.

474
00:20:42,970 --> 00:20:43,890
Please put it away.

475
00:20:43,890 --> 00:20:45,140
We don't allow smoking here,

476
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:45,960
Yes.

477
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:47,120
The hostess is strict.

478
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:51,210
No smoking, no smoking.

479
00:20:51,210 --> 00:20:52,670
This house belongs to you

480
00:20:52,670 --> 00:20:53,360
and me.

481
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:56,760
It's his.

482
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,650
There's no need to distinguish it so clearly.

483
00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:01,950
It's all the same.

484
00:21:06,530 --> 00:21:07,900
They're all here.

485
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:09,260
You're playing reserved with me.

486
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:12,960
I'm leaving.

487
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:14,020
Hold on.

488
00:21:16,490 --> 00:21:17,990
Honey, please take a leave.

489
00:21:18,370 --> 00:21:20,010
I have to stay here and keep an eye on them.

490
00:21:20,530 --> 00:21:21,050
What if they

491
00:21:21,050 --> 00:21:22,510
break our furniture?

492
00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:22,980
Right?

493
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:24,190
What could have happened to them?

494
00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:25,200
I've lent them the house.

495
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,260
Let them play tricks.

496
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:31,010
He joined the team to study, okay?

497
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:32,500
Mr. Long,

498
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:33,760
why aren't you in a hurry to find me?

499
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:35,660
Someone cut off the beard.

500
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:38,150
Okay,

501
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:40,320
I have something important to tell you.

502
00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:45,720
It's reasonable and legal

503
00:21:46,450 --> 00:21:48,100
in broad daylight.

504
00:21:56,330 --> 00:21:57,950
Remember to call me

505
00:21:57,950 --> 00:21:59,570
when you're back. -Where

506
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:09,000
are you going? -Mr. Long. Hello. Can

507
00:22:11,570 --> 00:22:12,750
you get out of the way?

508
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:13,630
I have something else to do.

509
00:22:13,630 --> 00:22:14,890
You've been chasing me here.

510
00:22:14,890 --> 00:22:16,320
Where else can I hide?

511
00:22:19,670 --> 00:22:20,360
Can I help you?

512
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:22,400
It's my fault for ignoring you

513
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,100
and acting with me last time, isn't it?

514
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:26,760
I don't think I know you.

515
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:29,770
I don't have a chance tonight.

516
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:31,770
The rest of the night belongs to you, okay?

517
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,680
I don't have to go back to the crew today.

518
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:38,660
Stay away from me!

519
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:50,690
Zhang Jingmei,

520
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:52,810
I underestimated you.

521
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:57,010
We'll all move out later.

522
00:22:57,010 --> 00:22:57,360
Okay,

Brother Peng.

526
00:23:00,050 --> 00:23:01,050
I don't think these two chairs

527
00:23:01,050 --> 00:23:02,180
look good here.

528
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:03,020
Let's move out later.

529
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:04,190
Okay. It's so hard

530
00:23:04,190 --> 00:23:04,740
to move out later.

531
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:05,900
This bag is yours, right, Jingmei.

532
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:06,720
Yes.

533
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:11,440
Bro,

534
00:23:11,630 --> 00:23:13,090
Zhang Jingmei just got here,

535
00:23:13,090 --> 00:23:14,140
She thought it was her own home.

536
00:23:14,450 --> 00:23:15,680
You're still young.

537

Sister Man Fei,

there's no rent in our group on the second floor,

539
00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:27,350
It may not be convenient to come up.

540
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:28,880
Are you looking for the bathroom?

541
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:29,960
Good for you.

542
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:31,730
Better than my acting skills.

543
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:33,320
After kissing Mr. Long,

544
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:34,130
you'll think

545
00:23:34,130 --> 00:23:35,180
you're the mistress of this place.

546
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:39,110
Do you have any misunderstanding?

547
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:40,200
Misunderstanding.

548
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:46,080
I respect you as an actor in the group.

549
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:47,730
Please respect me, too.

550
00:23:48,170 --> 00:23:49,740
If you have nothing else to do,

551
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:50,560
please leave.

552
00:23:50,870 --> 00:23:52,110
Let me tell you, Zhang Jingmei,

553
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:53,760
Mr. Long is my man,

554
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:55,060
You want to take it from me?

555
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:56,410
You don't deserve it.

556
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:00,680
Whose man does Long Yi work for?

557
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:02,540
Maybe it's not up to you, Man Fei.
