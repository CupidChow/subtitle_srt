1
00:02:28,919 --> 00:02:29,719
husband

2
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,159
Get up and eat.

3
00:02:32,199 --> 00:02:33,120
Eat it.

4
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,159
I'm not hungry.

5
00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:36,759
What's up

6
00:02:39,719 --> 00:02:40,639
I don't want to eat.

7
00:03:07,719 --> 00:03:08,400
Jialin, Jialing.

8
00:03:08,599 --> 00:03:10,039
Thank them for me.

9
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,840
I can't go this afternoon.

10
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,159
Long Yi is in a bad mood.

11
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,240
I want to be with him.

12
00:03:16,039 --> 00:03:17,280
Understand and love you.

13
00:03:36,919 --> 00:03:38,400
Book a flight to Guangzhou for me.

14
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:39,319
The sooner the better

15
00:04:06,199 --> 00:04:07,280
It's your 50th birthday.

16
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:10,840
little sister

17
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:14,639
Master

18
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:15,680
How's it going?

19
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,879
Young Master has obtained the testimony of the village head.

20
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,680
The video of the village head's testimony.

21
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,680
Wearing Nian's hot spring clothes.

22
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:24,560
The Battle of the Dragon Year is too obvious.

23
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,240
Did the shareholders take a stand?

24
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,720
He didn't say anything on the surface.

25
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,439
Actually, we're thinking about forming a team.

26
00:04:33,399 --> 00:04:34,000
Master

27
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:37,920
I'm afraid the children can't hold it.

28
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:40,319
Ask Xiao Kun to come back.

29
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:41,439
good

30
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,879
Let him go to Guangzhou directly.

31
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,160
It's Master.

32
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:48,360
If you don't help me this time,

33
00:04:49,399 --> 00:04:52,560
The Long Chen Foundation will be a joke.

34
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:55,680
I'll go first.

35
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,199
This is my most precious thing.

36
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:25,639
Nian's braised pork ribs

37
00:05:25,639 --> 00:05:26,959
Xiao Tian loves you the most.

38
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,720
sweet and sour fish

39
00:05:33,439 --> 00:05:34,680
My favorite.

40
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,480
Hundred acres of flowers.

41
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,639
The whole family loves it.

42
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,560
This is my favorite food.

43
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,680
I miss you.

44
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:57,839
How old am I?

45
00:05:59,839 --> 00:06:01,680
Then you want to eat flower cakes.

46
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,560
I'll make it for you.

47
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:05,639
Really

48
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,120
Of course it's true.

49
00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:08,040
You forgot?

50
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:08,920
I'm a perfect student.

51
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,199
Mom wrote such detailed steps.

52
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:12,839
Let's study hard.

53
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,879
I'll make the taste I made.

54
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,560
the two of us

55
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:20,639
A perfect student needs an assistant.

56
00:06:34,759 --> 00:06:35,600
dang!

57
00:06:36,439 --> 00:06:37,240
What happened

58
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:39,519
feed

59
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,160
You're waiting for me to collect your corpse.

60
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,399
What's wrong?

61
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:44,480
It's embarrassing.

62
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:48,519
Or is your artistic cells dying?

63
00:06:48,759 --> 00:06:49,199
roll

64
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,199
There are some new bars across the street.

65
00:06:58,199 --> 00:06:59,959
Some half-blood girls are very good.

66
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:02,839
Super cool.

67
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,360
Quit.

68
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,079
Let's have barbecue.

69
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:11,839
Don't eat.

70
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:17,519
Chen Xuanyi

71
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:30,040
I didn't expect Childe Luo to be so serious.

72
00:07:32,079 --> 00:07:33,480
When did I stop being serious?

73
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:35,600
Yes

74
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,519
You're serious about every girl.

75
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:39,879
But this girl

76
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,240
Don't you think it's special?

77
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:46,120
Since you were 16 years old,

78
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,879
Which girl?

79
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:51,040
It's you, Luo Beichen.

80
00:07:59,839 --> 00:08:00,680
actually

81
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:02,240
Have you ever thought about

82
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,319
To be in a real relationship.

83
00:08:09,439 --> 00:08:09,959
That

84
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:11,839
I'm sorry.

85
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,800
Although I really want to be in a real relationship,

86
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:14,839
But unfortunately,

87
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:15,839
I have someone I like.

88
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,360
What are you thinking?

89
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,519
What else can I think?

90
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,279
You can't...

91
00:08:21,279 --> 00:08:23,160
To give up all those fancy tricks.

92
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:25,240
Be nice to Chen Xuanyi?

93
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:30,560
Why didn't I be honest?

94
00:08:31,519 --> 00:08:33,000
When have I not been honest?

95
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,279
No

96
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:36,960
What does that mean?

97
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,360
Did I always talk about

98
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:40,799
Fake love?

99
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,000
Anyway, at this point,

100
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:46,240
You're worse than Long.

101
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,399
This is the flower cake I made for you.

102
00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:12,759
Hundred acres of fields of flowers?

103
00:09:16,559 --> 00:09:17,600
Was...

104
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,759
It's really beautiful here.

105
00:09:21,559 --> 00:09:22,679
I was prettier as a child.

106
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,159
The sky was even bluer when you were little.

107
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,159
The clouds are even whiter.

108
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:30,440
You're even more naughty.

109
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,080
What's up

110
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:32,639
The sky is not beautiful now.

111
00:09:32,799 --> 00:09:33,799
Clouds are not soft.

112
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,480
You're not handsome anymore.

113
00:09:35,879 --> 00:09:36,480
Little one.

114
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:37,840
Little one.

115
00:09:38,039 --> 00:09:38,919
Xiaoyi,

116
00:09:39,639 --> 00:09:40,559
Uncle Zhong,

117
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:42,159
Uncle Zhong,

118
00:09:42,679 --> 00:09:43,879
We haven't seen each other for years.

119
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,200
I haven't seen you back for so many years.

120
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:48,200
Why are you back today?

121
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,720
This is your family's property.

122
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,120
Why didn't you come back?

123
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,240
Our family

124
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:53,919
That's right.

125
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,039
Your mother left it for you.

126
00:10:02,159 --> 00:10:03,039
Now,

127
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,039
The flowers are in full bloom.

128
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,840
But you came at a bad time.

129
00:10:08,759 --> 00:10:10,440
I remember it used to be this season.

130
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,360
The season is right.

131
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:14,440
But the time is not right.

132
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:17,159
To make the best flower cakes,

133
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:19,480
Picking is the most important part.

134
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:23,200
Every morning, with the flowers in full bloom,

135
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,240
Is the best.

136
00:10:25,039 --> 00:10:26,759
When the sun comes out,

137
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:28,399
And boil the dew to dry.

138
00:10:28,519 --> 00:10:30,000
The fragrance of the flowers will evaporate.

139
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,639
So I have to wait for tomorrow morning.

140
00:10:33,159 --> 00:10:34,679
Is there a place to live around here?

141
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:35,799
Of course there is.

142
00:10:36,879 --> 00:10:37,799
Little Yi's mother.

143
00:10:37,799 --> 00:10:39,240
I love living here.

144
00:10:39,559 --> 00:10:41,120
In the past,

145
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,720
She took Xiao Yi and Hua Tian

146
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,159
For more than 10 or 20 days.

147
00:10:44,159 --> 00:10:45,799
Make different flower cakes every day.

148
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,879
If he sees you so happy now,

149
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,159
You must be very happy.

150
00:11:07,679 --> 00:11:08,399
Look.

151
00:11:12,679 --> 00:11:14,279
This place is simple and crude.

152
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:17,240
You can make do here tonight.

153
00:11:17,919 --> 00:11:19,159
How could it be, Uncle Zhong?

154
00:11:19,159 --> 00:11:20,480
I think it's good here.

155
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:21,799
Right, honey?

156
00:11:33,679 --> 00:11:34,840
Long Long, slow down.

157
00:11:35,559 --> 00:11:36,480
Hold on, Mom.

158
00:11:39,559 --> 00:11:40,320
Mom, mom.

159
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,200
What kind of flower is this? It smells good.

160
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,480
This is an orchid.

161
00:11:44,679 --> 00:11:46,159
Is my favorite flower.

162
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,639
It's so beautiful.

163
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,039
Mom, mom.

164
00:11:51,039 --> 00:11:53,080
Can you bring me here every year?

165
00:11:53,399 --> 00:11:53,960
good

166
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,960
I brought you here every year.

167
00:12:07,559 --> 00:12:08,000
President Chen.

168
00:12:08,919 --> 00:12:09,759
This can be found.

169
00:12:10,039 --> 00:12:11,480
That all the shareholders are investing in.

170
00:12:12,879 --> 00:12:13,600
You worked hard too.

171
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:14,519
Get off work early.

172
00:12:14,879 --> 00:12:15,679
You should rest early.

173
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,919
Shall I bring you a midnight snack?

174
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,320
Why are you here?

175
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,240
I'm here to bring you some black chicken soup.

176
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:44,240
It's good for your skin to drink more soup.

177
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:45,559
That

178
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,240
Listen to me while you drink.

179
00:12:47,639 --> 00:12:48,759
Just think of me as the background.

180
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:50,799
So Luo Beichen

181
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,320
The purpose of your visit today

182
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,480
Let me introduce myself formally.

183
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:11,480
My artistic talent

184
00:13:11,679 --> 00:13:13,840
Was discovered at the age of 13.

185
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:16,240
I've made a plan

186
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:18,039
It's a wise and mature decision.

187
00:13:18,519 --> 00:13:20,559
That's to give up martial arts.

188
00:13:20,759 --> 00:13:21,960
To study art.

189
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,759
When I was fifteen,

190
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:27,080
I suddenly fell in love with Iron Man.

191
00:13:35,799 --> 00:13:36,440
husband

192
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:38,960
It's raining so hard.

193
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:41,559
Will the flowers outside be damaged?

194
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,120
Mom said

195
00:13:44,919 --> 00:13:46,480
Only flowers that have experienced wind and rain

196
00:13:46,679 --> 00:13:47,759
Will be more sweet.

197
00:13:49,039 --> 00:13:49,879
Just like you.

198
00:13:54,919 --> 00:13:56,720
I must be

199
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:00,519
Gentle and pretty and virtuous.

200
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,000
And knows life well.

201
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:10,200
If you are still here,

202
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:13,080
I must really like you.

203
00:14:16,879 --> 00:14:18,879
I love that creativity. I'm telling you,

204
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:38,679
wife

205
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:40,679
Hurry up.

206
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:42,080
Come out. Come.

207
00:16:45,879 --> 00:16:46,519
What's up

208
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:47,279
see

209
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:50,360
Rainbow.

210
00:16:50,679 --> 00:16:52,320
This is so beautiful.

211
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:58,279
Honey, what are you doing?

212
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:00,360
Why are you standing still on such a fine day?

213
00:17:00,559 --> 00:17:01,759
Go to work and take a photo.

214
00:17:02,919 --> 00:17:03,679
Let's go.

215
00:17:14,119 --> 00:17:14,960
Young master.

216
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,920
According to Miss Lan's last wish,

217
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:18,240
After she passed away,

218
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:19,799
This place will be

219
00:17:19,799 --> 00:17:22,119
Who specialized in making flower cakes.

220
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:23,720
There are tourists occasionally.

221
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:25,640
To experience handmade here.

222
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:28,759
But the furnishings are still the same.

223
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,039
Nothing has changed.

224
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:32,480
I come here to clean every day.

225
00:17:41,079 --> 00:17:42,240
Out of the pot.

226
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,319
Yeah

227
00:17:44,359 --> 00:17:44,880
It's hot.

228
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:52,839
Try it.

229
00:17:59,079 --> 00:17:59,640
Is it delicious?

230
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:02,359
This one.

231
00:18:02,359 --> 00:18:05,000
But the result of mom and Yi's joint efforts

232
00:18:05,279 --> 00:18:06,640
Give it to me later.

233
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,960
Grandpa, grandpa and uncle.

234
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:09,519
all right?

235
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:11,960
We're really good.

236
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:14,880
President Nian.

237
00:18:15,119 --> 00:18:16,279
Long Xiao Kun has returned to China.

238
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:17,519
And went straight to Guangzhou.

239
00:18:19,319 --> 00:18:20,359
Captain Wu, where are they?

240
00:18:20,519 --> 00:18:22,160
Captain Wu has picked up Bai in Guangzhou.

241
00:18:22,519 --> 00:18:23,400
Our private jet

242
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,680
Be there on time at 2 p.m.

243
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,440
Isn't the Long's plane in the country?

244
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:27,279
In Switzerland,

245
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:28,839
Long Xiao Kun is now.

246
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:30,599
The fastest way to get the news.

247
00:18:30,839 --> 00:18:32,680
The earliest flight will arrive at 3 p.m..

248
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,160
I know.

249
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:55,160
this

250
00:18:56,319 --> 00:18:57,640
This recipe is not reliable.

251
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:58,599
Isn't it six minutes?

252
00:18:58,599 --> 00:18:59,359
What happened?

253
00:19:00,119 --> 00:19:01,119
Six minutes.

254
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,160
Should be in the sixth gear.

255
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:06,480
Come on.

256
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,000
Try it.

257
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:35,920
Long Yi.

258
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:39,519
Hot!

259
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,079
What about

260
00:19:47,279 --> 00:19:48,000
Is the taste right?

261
00:19:56,039 --> 00:19:57,839
The taste is not bad.

262
00:19:58,559 --> 00:19:59,680
There's something missing.

263
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,240
How could it be?

264
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:03,799
According to the recipe,

265
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:05,400
With perfect accuracy.

266
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:07,960
Are you eating too much?

267
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:08,960
Something's wrong with my taste.

268
00:20:09,519 --> 00:20:10,480
impossible

269
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,200
My mom took me to make it since I was little.

270
00:20:12,759 --> 00:20:14,079
I'll never forget the smell.

271
00:20:18,279 --> 00:20:20,200
What should we do?

272
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:28,240
wife

273
00:20:29,759 --> 00:20:30,920
My hand is injured.

274
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:32,880
It's okay. We're done.

275
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:34,200
It's just a flower cake.

276
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,079
No way

277
00:20:35,079 --> 00:20:36,359
Today is my birthday.

278
00:20:36,359 --> 00:20:37,519
I must make it.

279
00:20:38,079 --> 00:20:40,160
There must be something else in the middle.

280
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:50,839
I know.

281
00:21:07,119 --> 00:21:08,000
It's hot.

282
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:20,799
Correct!

283
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:22,960
Correct!

284
00:21:23,119 --> 00:21:23,839
This is the taste.

285
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:27,920
What about

286
00:21:29,839 --> 00:21:30,799
It tastes good.

287
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:37,720
Honey, you're so amazing.

288
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,640
How do you know there's an orchid missing?

289
00:21:50,279 --> 00:21:51,559
My mother is an orchid.

290
00:22:13,279 --> 00:22:13,680
Hello, President Long.

291
00:22:13,799 --> 00:22:14,200
Uncle Long.

292
00:22:17,599 --> 00:22:18,680
Inform the board.

293
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:19,680
Hold an emergency meeting this afternoon.

294
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:20,400
a row

295
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:25,720
How is it going?

296
00:22:26,319 --> 00:22:28,079
The shareholders are all seeking profits.

297
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,559
They'll definitely compete with the Bai family.

298
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:32,960
I think if we fight,

299
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:35,960
The Long family and the Nian family will lose.

300
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:39,279
Long Chen Foundation is a consortium.

301
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:40,799
Uncle, don't worry.

302
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:43,079
The Chen family won't quit.

303
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:58,759
Uncle Bai.

304
00:22:59,240 --> 00:22:59,759
Slow down.

305
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:01,400
Please come in.

306
00:23:01,599 --> 00:23:03,240
Dad, take it easy.

307
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:06,200
You two are fine.

308
00:23:06,359 --> 00:23:07,359
I'm not that old yet.

309
00:23:08,279 --> 00:23:08,839
Xiaonian

310
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,640
You said you wanted to talk to me about something important.

311
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:13,920
Why are you here?

312
00:23:15,079 --> 00:23:15,759
Uncle Bai.

313
00:23:16,039 --> 00:23:18,279
You haven't seen my dad for years.

314
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:21,480
I don't want you two to talk about old times.

315
00:23:21,759 --> 00:23:22,440
To meet each other.

316
00:23:24,119 --> 00:23:25,480
When you're done,

317
00:23:26,839 --> 00:23:28,960
Let's talk about business.

318
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,440
Your father is so blessed.

319
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:33,839
Yuqi

320
00:23:34,359 --> 00:23:35,319
Look, Brother Shiyu,

321
00:23:35,519 --> 00:23:36,359
Learn from it.

322
00:23:36,599 --> 00:23:37,279
dad

323
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,240
I'm not bad either.

324
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:40,880
Uncle Bai, don't you know?

325
00:23:41,599 --> 00:23:43,240
Now Yusaki's fame in the business world

326
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:44,720
It's louder than me.

327
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:45,720
Really?

328
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:46,759
No, no.

329
00:23:46,759 --> 00:23:47,680
I didn't see it.

330
00:23:48,039 --> 00:23:49,000
Please come in.

331
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:57,359
It's delicious.

332
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:58,799
Grandpa, eat slowly.

333
00:23:59,160 --> 00:23:59,759
There are plenty of cakes.

334
00:24:00,519 --> 00:24:01,319
Drink water.

335
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:02,359
old age

336
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:03,279
What are you eating?

337
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:04,480
You're so blessed.

338
00:24:04,759 --> 00:24:05,839
Uncle Bai, flowers.

339
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:06,680
Do you still recognize me?

340
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,599
Bai Lao Bai.

341
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:11,200
I recognize you even if you turn into dust.

342
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:12,839
Back then, we were together.

343
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,359
You're barefoot.

344
00:24:14,599 --> 00:24:16,119
Come and sit down.

345
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,519
I'm the one with bare feet.

346
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:20,319
You have shoes to wear.

347
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:22,160
Leave now. Nian's family doesn't welcome you.

348
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:24,559
I don't want to fight with you in front of my grandfather.

349
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:25,839
How is your health?

350
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,039
It's okay.

351
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:31,160
The body is as strong as anything.

352
00:24:31,759 --> 00:24:33,200
Come and eat the flower cakes.

353
00:24:33,519 --> 00:24:34,640
This is Xiaoyi, right?

354
00:24:34,839 --> 00:24:35,559
uncle

355
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:36,240
Uncle Bai.

356
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:38,319
Remember your Uncle Bai?

357
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:39,640
It's my first time to ride a motorcycle.

358
00:24:39,799 --> 00:24:40,920
You brought me to ride it.

359
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:47,480
Uncles and uncles,

360
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:49,000
To invite you here today.

361
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:50,400
I hope you can rest assured.

362
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:51,880
I've prepared some

363
00:24:52,039 --> 00:24:53,920
The project that everyone is concerned about recently.

364
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:54,839
Don't worry.

365
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:55,720
Old Dragon.

366
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:56,960
Where is Master Bai?

367
00:24:57,279 --> 00:24:59,279
Didn't you say you went to Guangzhou to invite people?

368
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:00,720
Old Dragon.

369
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,480
Haven't we agreed?

370
00:25:02,599 --> 00:25:04,200
The Bai family came in the second round.

371
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:05,440
Don't worry.

372
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:07,240
The contract hasn't been signed yet.

373
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:08,559
Is it President Long?

374
00:25:09,079 --> 00:25:09,680
Yes

375
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,359
Xu is right.

376
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,640
Don't worry.

377
00:25:13,559 --> 00:25:14,720
Let me explain to you.

378
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:17,480
The Bai family is the king of gold.

379
00:25:17,839 --> 00:25:20,000
Is also an important part of our financial alliance.

380
00:25:20,279 --> 00:25:22,200
But all of us here

381
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,079
It's not bad.

382
00:25:24,519 --> 00:25:25,480
Be equal in match or contest of strength

383
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:26,240
Right?

384
00:25:26,839 --> 00:25:29,720
Even if Bai doesn't shoot in the second round,

385
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:30,400
We

386
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,119
Old Dragon.

387
00:25:31,319 --> 00:25:32,359
I'll be frank.

388
00:25:33,559 --> 00:25:35,640
What if your in-laws fight?

389
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:37,599
Don't treat our brothers as cannon fodder.

390
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:39,599
How is that possible?

391
00:25:39,599 --> 00:25:40,119
Old Dragon.

392
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:41,279
It's not me.

393
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:42,640
We are our own people.

394
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,240
You don't have to say this.

395
00:25:44,759 --> 00:25:46,599
Who are you fighting with?

396
00:25:47,319 --> 00:25:48,839
If the Bai family can't handle it,

397
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:51,880
I won't follow your capital pool.

398
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:55,400
Then I want to stress to you.

399
00:25:55,759 --> 00:25:56,960
Long Chen Foundation

400
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,759
But the Long family and the Chen family

401
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:00,440
Is an imperative project.

402
00:26:01,319 --> 00:26:02,680
In this project,

403
00:26:02,839 --> 00:26:03,519
We need you

404
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:04,319
Where is the time?

405
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:05,039
Don't worry.

406
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:05,960
There's no time.

407
00:26:06,039 --> 00:26:07,759
We will definitely support

408
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:09,599
It's too late.

409
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:11,519
Can I not be anxious?

410
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:12,359
uncle

411
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:14,319
This is the flower cake Xiaoyi and I made.

412
00:26:14,319 --> 00:26:15,000
Have a taste.

413
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,799
That's right.

414
00:26:17,759 --> 00:26:19,799
Back then, we...

415
00:26:19,799 --> 00:26:21,359
This pretty girl is...

416
00:26:22,279 --> 00:26:23,400
This is my wife Jingmei.

417
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:24,960
Hello, Grandpa.

418
00:26:25,319 --> 00:26:26,200
Alright.

419
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:27,240
Old people.

420
00:26:27,359 --> 00:26:28,759
You're really lucky.

421
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:29,480
Yuqi

422
00:26:29,799 --> 00:26:30,640
Learn from it.

423
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:31,640
dad

424
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:34,559
You two should try some fresh flower cakes.

425
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:35,440
Have a taste.

426
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:36,680
Look at my cooking.

427
00:26:36,839 --> 00:26:38,279
What's the difference between you and your grandma and aunt?

428
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:39,720
Okay, thank you.

429
00:26:40,759 --> 00:26:42,359
It's fresh. Try it.

430
00:26:42,359 --> 00:26:43,000
uncle

431
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:44,480
Try it.

432
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:45,359
It's fresh.

433
00:26:45,759 --> 00:26:46,839
Shi Lan's skills

434
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:48,720
Is no worse than her aunt.

435
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:50,200
Shiyu

436
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:51,279
Try it.

437
00:26:53,079 --> 00:26:53,559
dad

438
00:26:55,359 --> 00:26:56,240
She's not Shi Lan.

439
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:00,799
uncle

440
00:27:01,559 --> 00:27:02,119
uncle

441
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,079
This is my mom's birthday flower cake.

442
00:27:06,079 --> 00:27:06,640
How are you?

443
00:27:08,359 --> 00:27:09,240
How is the taste?

444
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:12,720
It tastes good.

445
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:16,079
It's really good.

446
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:20,640
Yummy

447
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:21,960
It's delicious.

448
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:32,319
One more. It's delicious.

449
00:27:34,839 --> 00:27:35,799
Shi Lan.

450
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:39,200
Call Xiao Kun back later.

451
00:27:39,839 --> 00:27:41,359
The whole family is so noisy.

452
00:27:42,079 --> 00:27:43,680
To celebrate your birthday.

453
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:44,720
Okay, grandpa.

454
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:47,680
Don't you think so?

455
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:49,960
This flower cake is really good.

456
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,000
Yummy

457
00:28:03,359 --> 00:28:04,039
Shi Lan.

458
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:08,039
I didn't expect that

459
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:13,519
And I can eat the flower cakes you made.
