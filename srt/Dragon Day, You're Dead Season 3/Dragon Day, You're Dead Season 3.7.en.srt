can I, Chen, have the final say?

just write an IOU.

He's going to Africa in a few days.

We have to see him off no matter what.

115
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:32,710
I know a new store

116

doesn't have time for me to work,

117

What class?

118

Why are you afraid of grandpa?

119
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:40,550
I was afraid of the shadow of my childhood.

Why is she here?

121

Lend it to me.

130
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:20,820

Why do you work here too?

Why haven't I seen you before?

135
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:37,240
I don't usually come to the company.

136
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,400
It's normal that you haven't seen me.

137
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:48,500
(Vice President Long Yi).

138
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:52,720
Are you Long Yi?

139
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:54,830
What do you think?

140
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:56,500
Would you like to have dinner with me?

141

Okay,

142
00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:00,880
But I haven't been to Mr. Long's office yet.

143

Can you take me there?

Okay.

which department do you like again?

149
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,680
If you play with your phone during working hours,

150
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,420
it seems that your salary won't be much this month.

00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:21,740
What's going on?

152
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:22,910
How do I know what's going on?

153
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:27,400
I heard Long Yi wants to have dinner with me, right?

154
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,430
No,

155
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:29,050
I didn't.

156
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:31,140
Do you have it or not?

157
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:32,560
Yes, yes, yes.

158
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:34,320
This... This is my assistant.

159

Don't listen to him.

160

What are you talking about?

164
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,270
No, no, I didn't.

165
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:43,000
Don't listen to him.

166
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,700
It seems that you have differences.

167
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:46,020
Why don't you two discuss it again?

168
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:47,070
No need to discuss.

169
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:50,300
This Xuan Yi,

00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:54,700
I'm just messing with you.

172
00:07:54,990 --> 00:07:55,750
I'm just kidding.

173
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,000
I'll deduct my salary.

174
00:07:58,220 --> 00:07:59,430
Meeting friends during working hours,

175
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:00,630
playing mobile phones during working hours,

176
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:01,790
I was just fooling around during work hours,

177
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:03,640
so I left like this.

178
00:08:05,530 --> 00:08:06,790
Chen Xuanyi,

179
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:09,110
what's wrong with you?

180
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:10,470
What's wrong with you?

181
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,940
Why did you hire her?

182
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:12,590
What's wrong with her?

183
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:22,240
Inadvertently making friends?

184
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,610
The shadow of childhood.

185
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,160
Chen Xuanyi,

186
00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:29,000
remember?

187
00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:32,890
Chen Xuanyi,

188
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:36,430
that's a nice name,

189
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:39,370
Oh no.

190
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,000
It's all over.

191
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:43,250
Wait,

192
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:44,380
what kind of taste do you have?

193
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:45,290
You have a crush on her?

194
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:47,490
Even if you're not afraid of Zhang Jingmei,

195
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:49,220
am I still afraid of Chen Xuanyi, a delicate woman?

196
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:50,560
A delicate woman.

197
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:53,540
Oh my goodness.

198
00:08:58,840 --> 00:08:59,360
What's wrong?

199
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:04,260
(Yu Lang: Hello, Yi, watch the video)

200
00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:05,030
So,

201
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:06,670
Deng Manfei in the camera,

202
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:08,480
Actually, I'm your stand-in.

203
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:09,080
Yes.

204
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:11,000
Because I'm inexperienced,

205
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,210
I was accidentally injured by Mr. Meng Hao.

206
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:14,450
Long Yi thought,

207
00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:15,880
I was hurt on purpose.

208
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:17,360
That's why he pushed Mr. Meng Hao away

209
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,620
in a hurry.

210
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:19,890
So,

211
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:21,270
it has nothing to do

212
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:22,450
with Deng Man Fei.

213
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:24,040
Yeah, it doesn't matter at all.

214
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:24,960
Jingmei is good.

215
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:25,860
It's quite photogenic.

216
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,490
Remember to punch in

217
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:31,440
for me. Got it.

218
00:09:40,810 --> 00:09:42,320
Chen Xuanyi.

219
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:46,090
Not bad.

220
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,240
It's a nice style.

221
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:52,870
Jingmei will like it.

222
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:54,460
It's strong,

223
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:55,060
Mom and Dad.

224
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,470
It's time to change my bed.

225
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:58,180
Change your head.

226
00:09:58,180 --> 00:09:59,830
It's better to replace you.

227
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:01,250
You're too partial.

228
00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:03,100
I haven't changed my bed since junior high.

229
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:04,190
I don't have enough sleep now.

230
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:06,260
Why do you want to change it?

231
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:07,610
Since you were in junior high school,

232
00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:08,670
you haven't grown up.

233
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:09,080
Me,

234
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,530
I've gained weight, okay?

235
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:12,410
If you get married,

236
00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:13,260
I'll send you

237
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:14,490
to get married right away,

238
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,560
How long do we have to wait?

239
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:18,400
Honey,

240
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:20,190
let me see this one.

241
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,340
Why don't you take a picture of Jingmei?

242
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:23,240
Okay. Come on. Let her

243
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,170
have a look.

244
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:25,770
You're so biased.

245
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:27,000
It's all taken.

246
00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:28,340
Come on,

247
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:31,370
Because it happened all of a sudden,

248
00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:32,180
I didn't clarify it to everyone.

249
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:32,620
Sis,

250
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:33,520
That led to so many misunderstandings.

251
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:34,480
Dad, look.

252
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,230
Sis,

253
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:36,090
Mom,

254
00:10:36,090 --> 00:10:36,760
Mr. Long entrusted me,

255
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:37,190
My sister

256
00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:38,670
I'm here to apologize to you.

257
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:40,670
Apologize to Mr. Meng Hao

258
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:43,220
and Ms. Deng Man Fei involved in this matter.

259
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,440
Why should she apologize for him?

260
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,820
I'm sorry, Ms. Zhang,

261
00:10:54,050 --> 00:10:56,230
but the feedback from the audience is a bit intense,

262
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:57,840
Can you explain it to me?

263
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,430
What about your relationship with Mr. Long Yi?

264
00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:06,840
She's my wife,

265
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:09,040
Long Yi's legal wife.

266
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:10,370
Zhang Jingmei,

267
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:12,630
from now on,

268
00:11:12,830 --> 00:11:15,180
no matter where and at any time my wife is,

269
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:17,290
You can represent me with full authority.

270
00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:24,400
Mom and Dad,

271
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:25,360
I think my sister,

272
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,660
You don't need this bed anymore, do you?

273
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:28,300
Buy it for me.

274
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,450
As my wife said just now,

275
00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:34,700
I did

276
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:36,130
set some bad examples before.

277
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:38,130
I'm here today to apologize to everyone.

278
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:50,040
How dare you apologize

279
00:11:55,210 --> 00:11:56,970
for your thoughtlessness?

280
00:11:57,170 --> 00:11:57,880
Of course

281
00:11:58,820 --> 00:11:59,990
My wife taught me that.

282
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,390
How can I grow up if I don't know how to apologize?

283
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:04,660
Mrs. Long,

284
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:06,660
thank you for your hard work.

285
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:08,720
You have to deal with this kind of situation alone.

286
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:10,430
I'm sorry,

287
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:12,910
honey. I think things are too simple.

288
00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:15,080

289
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:16,240

Jing Mei

514
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:40,970
Sis, what's wrong?

515
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,160
What outside people?

516

What outside people?

517
00:21:44,310 --> 00:21:44,920
I don't know.

518
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:46,510
I saw the news just now.

519
00:21:46,790 --> 00:21:49,330
There's no news about their marriage.

520
00:21:49,330 --> 00:21:50,850
Isn't this an outsider?

521
00:21:50,850 --> 00:21:51,230
That's right.

522
00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:52,510
And I was caught on camera.

523
00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:54,050
You can eat things indiscriminately,

524
00:21:54,050 --> 00:21:55,560
but you can't talk nonsense.

525
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:56,040
But.

526
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:57,090
I didn't make up

527
00:21:57,090 --> 00:21:58,010
what was said in the news.

528
00:21:58,010 --> 00:21:58,600

I'll get another car and go there.

533
00:22:08,030 --> 00:22:08,820
Okay.

534
00:22:10,970 --> 00:22:11,540
Light,

Master.

537
00:22:13,170 --> 00:22:14,040
Where are you going, Zhang?

538
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:14,840
I'm in a hurry.

539
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:17,500
(Playing the rough love road of Meng Hao, netizens said that "the woman who fell in love with the dragon" is too exciting)

540
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:28,650

Dragon Slaying Love,

00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,730
How can you thank me?

544
00:22:33,730 --> 00:22:35,470
You should thank me.

545
00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:37,030
You took advantage of me.

546
00:22:37,030 --> 00:22:38,470
Distract the attention of public opinion,

547
00:22:38,890 --> 00:22:41,160
and make false propaganda by real actors,

548
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,840
It's a pity that you stole the news

549
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:45,430
of the stuntman,

550
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:47,730
The stuntman is Young Madam Long.

551
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:49,480
The news didn't move.

552
00:22:50,150 --> 00:22:51,260
Then.

553
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:53,350
How do you want me to thank you?

554
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:54,680
Then.

555
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:57,010
God knows it. You know it. I know it.

556
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:09,670
Isn't this photo really fixed?

557
00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:12,980
But I've never been there.

558
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:14,230
What on earth is going on?

559
00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:15,810
All right, calm down, honey.

560
00:23:15,810 --> 00:23:17,520
What matters is not what the media say,

561
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,140
but what matters is that I believe you.

562
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:25,700
I got it.

563
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:27,210
The person in the photo is Deng Man Fei.

564
00:23:32,030 --> 00:23:34,060
But we don't have any evidence.

565
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,430
If you jump into the Yellow River, you won't be able to wash it away.

566
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:40,100
You even messed up the foundation.

567
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:41,680
Grandpa must be furious.

568
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:43,750
What should we do now?

569
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:44,680
It's okay,

570
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:46,280
honey. Just listen to me.

571
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:48,280
What should we do?

572
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:49,660
Let them talk if they like,

573
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:50,860
Isn't it just gossip?

574
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:52,170
Just be Mrs. Long

575

in a down-to-earth manner.

576
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,160
Nothing else happened.

577
00:23:55,450 --> 00:23:56,020
Okay?

578
00:23:56,670 --> 00:23:58,020
Based on your experience,

579
00:23:58,020 --> 00:23:59,150
I'm not used to it.

580
00:23:59,150 --> 00:24:00,130
Just get used to it.

581

What do you think about Meng Hao being beaten?

585
00:24:09,350 --> 00:24:10,080
I'm not sure.

586
00:24:11,670 --> 00:24:13,720
How did they know my number?

587
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:15,270
