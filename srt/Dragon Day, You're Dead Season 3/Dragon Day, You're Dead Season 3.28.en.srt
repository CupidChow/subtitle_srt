1
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,199
Little brother.

2
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,840
Can you help me take a photo?

3
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:13,439
good

4
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,520
One, two, three.

5
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,879
Thank you, President Su.

6
00:03:26,719 --> 00:03:27,319
Take care.

7
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,960
It's finally over.

8
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:37,919
I'm exhausted.

9
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:43,719
Jialin, thank you.

10
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:44,960
If you weren't there,

11
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:46,879
I really don't know what to do.

12
00:03:47,479 --> 00:03:49,599
Hurry to hire someone, President Zhang.

13
00:03:49,759 --> 00:03:51,159
My part-time job

14
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:53,000
You're going to use it badly.

15
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,159
But it's also strange.

16
00:03:57,639 --> 00:03:59,680
Why are there so many people here?

17
00:04:00,919 --> 00:04:02,639
What do you think, Mrs. Long?

18
00:04:02,919 --> 00:04:04,000
I'm here at WeChat Moments.

19
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,879
And sent a script casually.

20
00:04:06,199 --> 00:04:08,360
Your influence is really great.

21
00:04:08,919 --> 00:04:10,439
That's great for WeChat Moments.

22
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:13,039
At least we don't have to look for the script.

23
00:04:13,719 --> 00:04:15,039
For the first time,

24
00:04:15,479 --> 00:04:18,199
It's great to be someone's wife.

25
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:21,240
To be Long Yi's wife.

26
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:22,959
It's really good.

27
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,639
Oh, no. I forgot about him.

28
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:28,879
handsome guy

29
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,160
Please make way.

30
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,319
You're in my lens.

31
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:33,399
Sorry

32
00:04:34,439 --> 00:04:34,959
Thank you

33
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:35,639
Nothing

34
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:41,360
sorry

35
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,560
I kept you waiting for so long.

36
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,600
It's done so soon.

37
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:43,839
Well

38
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:45,800
Let's go home.

39
00:04:46,439 --> 00:04:47,399
Let's go home.

40
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,480
I'll take you to a place.

41
00:04:49,079 --> 00:04:49,600
Give me the key.

42
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,360
I'll drive it today.

43
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:57,639
Beauty

44
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:58,879
Are you finished?

45
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,160
to wait a moment

46
00:05:00,439 --> 00:05:02,000
Is your boyfriend waiting in line for you?

47
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:02,639
Hold on.

48
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:03,360
When I finish shooting,

49
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,240
Sorry

50
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,000
We're in a hurry.

51
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:11,720
Sorry

52
00:05:19,839 --> 00:05:20,800
Where are you going, wife?

53
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:22,319
You'll know when you arrive.

54
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,120
How about I drive it?

55
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,240
No need

56
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,160
Honey, don't be afraid.

57
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:31,959
Don't hit the brakes.

58
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,480
Don't worry, honey.

59
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,360
I'm also a driver with a book.

60
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:43,120
By the way, Dad,

61
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,600
Long Mei Island has been decorated.

62
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:48,360
Pick a date for Yi's wedding.

63
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,120
I'm leading the troops.

64
00:05:52,839 --> 00:05:54,560
Yi, the jewelry store is closed.

65
00:05:54,959 --> 00:05:56,079
What is he doing recently?

66
00:05:56,199 --> 00:05:56,959
Nothing.

67
00:05:57,439 --> 00:05:58,120
At home.

68
00:06:00,199 --> 00:06:02,759
It's not easy for Dragon Boy to grow scales.

69
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,279
Eating a car?

70
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:06,680
dad

71
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,639
You still have time to eat.

72
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:13,680
I will checkmate you with this step.

73
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:16,920
Try it.

74
00:06:19,519 --> 00:06:19,680
you

75
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:22,000
Where are you digging for me?

76
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,319
You're dead.

77
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:25,839
Take a look.

78
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:29,560
this

79
00:06:30,879 --> 00:06:31,959
Isn't it checkmate?

80
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:08,639
Xuan Yi.

81
00:07:09,399 --> 00:07:09,879
That

82
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:10,759
Wash your hands first.

83
00:07:10,879 --> 00:07:11,680
Let's go and eat.

84
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:14,279
Luo Beichen.

85
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:16,920
I'm a little tired today.

86
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,519
Why don't you go and eat yourself?

87
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:22,000
What do you want to eat?

88
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:22,800
I'll bring it up for you.

89
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:24,639
Hello

90
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:28,079
Some people say that if you choose Commander,

91
00:07:28,839 --> 00:07:31,040
You can grant me any request.

92
00:07:31,879 --> 00:07:33,920
I don't know if it can be cashed.

93
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,879
I just want to see your smile.

94
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:40,279
Commander is looking at you.

95
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:44,560
Stop

96
00:07:52,279 --> 00:07:53,040
Chen Xuanyi

97
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,040
Master Kitano asked me to give you a message.

98
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:57,160
he

99
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:58,800
Likeyou

100
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,279
Little sister.

101
00:08:27,319 --> 00:08:28,040
Are you looking for me?

102
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,160
I'm looking for

103
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:31,120
scoundrel

104
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:32,759
I'm the bad guy.

105
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:35,639
You're not bad enough.

106
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:37,279
Then add a WeChat.

107
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:37,759
Sorry

108
00:08:37,759 --> 00:08:38,440
Is it not good?

109
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:41,000
I don't know either

110
00:08:41,879 --> 00:08:43,000
How about you ask my girlfriend?

111
00:08:43,639 --> 00:08:44,320
She went to the bathroom.

112
00:08:45,559 --> 00:08:47,360
You are so good.

113
00:08:47,799 --> 00:08:48,320
bye-bye

114
00:08:57,519 --> 00:08:59,399
I was teased by a few girls.

115
00:09:00,519 --> 00:09:02,519
Do you want me to be your wingman?

116
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,039
You're here.

117
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,480
Hello, hello.

118
00:09:06,519 --> 00:09:08,080
I haven't seen you for a long time.

119
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:46,759
wife

120
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:47,240
come

121
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,759
Honey, take it easy.

122
00:10:00,159 --> 00:10:01,279
We'll be there soon.

123
00:10:02,759 --> 00:10:03,519
Hold on.

124
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:04,840
This is it.

125
00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:06,799
The rain is too heavy.

126
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:09,679
302 has checked out.

127
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,000
Do you need to ask the cleaner

128
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:11,960
Go and have a look.

129
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:12,879
Are you all right?

130
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:13,159
Nothing

131
00:10:13,759 --> 00:10:14,120
Hello

132
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:14,639
hello

133
00:10:14,639 --> 00:10:16,440
I've booked a special room with a big bed.

134
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,279
With a special price.

135
00:10:19,639 --> 00:10:20,759
Yes, Zhang Jingmei.

136
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,240
It's booked at three in the afternoon.

137
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:23,440
Sorry

138
00:10:23,559 --> 00:10:24,799
We don't have this reservation here.

139
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:26,840
No.

140
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,240
The confirmation has been sent to me.

141
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,919
And I have paid for it.

142
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,000
I'm sorry, I didn't.

143
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,519
Maybe the third-party platform made a mistake.

144
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,600
This is the message from your hotel.

145
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,559
What's wrong, honey?

146
00:10:40,919 --> 00:10:41,440
I'm fine.

147
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,200
Wait a second.

148
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:45,440
What's up

149
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:46,960
Manager

150
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:50,039
She said she booked a room with a special price.

151
00:10:51,639 --> 00:10:52,440
Excuse me, ma'am.

152
00:10:52,639 --> 00:10:53,639
I don't have your reservation.

153
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,679
How about you book a new one?

154
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,799
But we don't have the specials anymore.

155
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:00,320
You mean if I reorder it,

156
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,679
There's no discount, right?

157
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:03,360
Yes, we can only book at the original price.

158
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,600
What's going on, honey?

159
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:08,639
Honey, I can fix it.

160
00:11:08,639 --> 00:11:09,440
Wait a second.

161
00:11:09,639 --> 00:11:10,600
Hello, this lady.

162
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:11,080
Hello

163
00:11:11,159 --> 00:11:13,159
I didn't say my name just now.

164
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,000
I didn't say what time I made the reservation.

165
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,440
Why are you looking at it?

166
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,279
You will know that there is no record of me.

167
00:11:19,039 --> 00:11:20,519
But now,

168
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,279
I really don't have your reservation record.

169
00:11:23,039 --> 00:11:23,799
Take a look.

170
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,679
It was sent to me by a third-party platform.

171
00:11:25,679 --> 00:11:27,360
Confirm that I'm on the hotel.

172
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,519
The reservation has been made.

173
00:11:28,519 --> 00:11:30,480
And my room must have been booked.

174
00:11:30,759 --> 00:11:32,399
I didn't know it was because of the rain.

175
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,799
You want to cancel the promotion?

176
00:11:33,799 --> 00:11:36,559
Or do you want to raise the price directly?

177
00:11:36,879 --> 00:11:38,120
I'm sorry that our guest

178
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,360
How to set the price and how to manage it.

179
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,720
It's something inside our hotel.

180
00:11:40,879 --> 00:11:42,240
We don't have to report to you.

181
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,480
But now,

182
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:44,879
I really don't have your reservation information.

183
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:46,480
Please rebook your room.

184
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,799
Or go to another hotel.

185
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:48,840
Honey, wait a second.

186
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:49,519
Manager, right?

187
00:11:49,639 --> 00:11:50,120
hello

188
00:11:50,879 --> 00:11:52,960
Can you give me your boss's number?

189
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,039
Sorry

190
00:11:54,039 --> 00:11:54,840
This is inconvenient.

191
00:11:57,159 --> 00:11:59,080
Okay, I'm not staying in your hotel now.

192
00:11:59,200 --> 00:11:59,879
I want to ask

193
00:11:59,879 --> 00:12:01,519
How about you return this to me?

194
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:03,120
I might need you to

195
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,600
To contact the third party.

196
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:05,639
No

197
00:12:05,879 --> 00:12:07,080
Hello, hello.

198
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,720
It's 12315, right?

199
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:11,679
Yes

200
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,440
I'm complaining.

201
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,679
Hotel Fitt

202
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:17,519
Yes

203
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:26,080
husband

204
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:27,200
I just checked it.

205
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,480
There's another hotel 8 kilometers away.

206
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:29,240
Let's go there.

207
00:12:29,679 --> 00:12:30,240
Listen to me.

208
00:12:30,519 --> 00:12:30,919
hello

209
00:12:31,159 --> 00:12:32,600
Have you decided which room to open?

210
00:12:33,159 --> 00:12:34,120
My wife has already chosen.

211
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,399
We're going to make a special price on the big bed room.

212
00:12:35,879 --> 00:12:36,799
I'm sorry, sir.

213
00:12:36,799 --> 00:12:38,159
I understand your feelings.

214
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,919
But we didn't.

215
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:40,399
Manager

216
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:40,799
What's up

217
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,320
12315 called.

218
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,000
What's up

219
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:47,919
With a special price.

220
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,240
Check out before 12 tomorrow.

221
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:50,200
The overtime is counted as two days.

222
00:12:50,279 --> 00:12:51,360
Pay full price from the next day.

223
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:53,679
OK

224
00:12:58,879 --> 00:12:59,399
Wait for me.

225
00:12:59,720 --> 00:12:59,919
Well

226
00:13:03,919 --> 00:13:04,759
The manager

227
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:06,480
I'll open ten more rooms.

228
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,240
The ten rooms

229
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:12,720
Is always free and open to guests who need it.

230
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,639
It's rainy and snowy today.

231
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:16,600
Okay?

232
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:19,759
Who are you?

233
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,039
It doesn't matter who I am.

234
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:23,159
The card can be used.

235
00:13:23,919 --> 00:13:24,360
Right?

236
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:49,799
What's up

237
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:54,120
Yes?

238
00:13:55,919 --> 00:13:57,360
I don't know about Mr. Long.

239
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,919
Are you feeling better?

240
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:03,799
You have to guess, Mrs. Long.

241
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,840
Mrs. Long thinks that

242
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:07,440
You did a great job today.

243
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,679
Really? How is that great?

244
00:14:11,799 --> 00:14:14,320
Mature and mature, resourceful and loving.

245
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:16,799
Really?

246
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:22,080
What's the reward for Mrs. Long?

247
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,879
To reward you with a special price.

248
00:14:25,879 --> 00:14:26,840
And a one-day honeymoon.

249
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,519
One day of honeymoon.

250
00:14:30,279 --> 00:14:30,960
Zhang Jingmei

251
00:14:31,639 --> 00:14:34,000
Is this a big room?

252
00:14:34,279 --> 00:14:34,840
husband

253
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,440
Listen to my explanation.

254
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:37,039
Explain what?

255
00:14:38,159 --> 00:14:39,200
How can I explain it?

256
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,200
You have to replan.

257
00:14:42,159 --> 00:14:43,039
This plan

258
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:44,679
Long Yi, I'm not satisfied.

259
00:14:46,039 --> 00:14:46,840
Call her husband.

260
00:15:44,679 --> 00:15:45,440
Let's buy something to drink.

261
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,559
Your hair is wet.

262
00:15:47,679 --> 00:15:48,039
Nothing

263
00:15:50,679 --> 00:15:51,879
Hello, what do you want?

264
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:52,519
What are you drinking?

265
00:15:53,679 --> 00:15:54,679
I want plain milk tea.

266
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:55,799
Pure milk tea

267
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:33,360
Give me the key.

268
00:16:35,559 --> 00:16:37,279
Can you go back to your room?

269
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:38,679
Nothing.

270
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,039
The money has been paid.

271
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,360
Brother, you gave too much.

272
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:49,279
Rain, take a taxi.

273
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:50,399
Thank you.

274
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:51,799
Good people live a safe life.

275
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,279
It's safe.

276
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,639
I want to be safe.

277
00:17:02,519 --> 00:17:03,360
of surprise

278
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:06,279
It's so nice to report it.

279
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:10,519
You're really back.

280
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:16,480
It's none of my business.

281
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:33,119
Honey, aren't you sleepy?

282
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:33,920
What time is it?

283
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:35,599
I woke you up.

284
00:20:38,759 --> 00:20:40,039
You woke me up.

285
00:20:40,279 --> 00:20:41,200
It's actually not noisy at all.

286
00:20:47,119 --> 00:20:48,160
You work so hard.

287
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:49,440
Of course.

288
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,960
You must do it well.

289
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:53,519
This is something that grows in your heart.

290
00:20:56,119 --> 00:20:56,519
wife

291
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,519
Don't scare me.

292
00:21:00,519 --> 00:21:01,799
In the middle of the night,

293
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,799
Things can grow in your mind.

294
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:08,400
There is a seed in everyone's heart.

295
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:11,200
Every seed must be watered carefully.

296
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,279
So that I can grow what I want to do.

297
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:16,400
I don't know the seed in Young Master Long's heart.

298
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,039
What will happen?

299
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:49,400
dang!

300
00:21:50,079 --> 00:21:50,759
Chen Xuanyi

301
00:21:52,359 --> 00:21:54,240
Are you going to sleep and I want to run away?
