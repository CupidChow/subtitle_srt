1
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,120
Thank you.

2
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:57,840
Thank you for coming.

3
00:02:59,639 --> 00:02:59,919
Let's go.

4
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:05,800
I don't want milk tea.

5
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,639
I don't want chicken soup either.

6
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:07,439
Order here.

7
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:08,360
I'm here to sign Zhang Jingmei.

8
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,199
This is our menu.

9
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,280
Stop it, Jialin.

10
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:12,960
Zhang Da cartoonist

11
00:03:13,159 --> 00:03:14,879
is not Zhang Da author,

12
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,439
I have to sign you right away.

13
00:03:16,719 --> 00:03:17,800
I just got a tip that

14
00:03:17,919 --> 00:03:19,599
a group of agents and film companies

15
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:21,000
are lining up to get your IP.

16
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,439
You have to sign it for me.

17
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:26,560
I've brought the contract.

18
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:51,840
At the end of last year,

19
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,400
Long Group officially entered

20
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:55,039
the new energy vehicle manufacturing industry

21
00:03:55,199 --> 00:03:56,439
and put forward several new concepts.

22
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,680
For example, car batteries, clean energy,

23
00:04:00,919 --> 00:04:02,719
long-distance battery life and unmanned driving.

24
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:03,360
Mr. Long,

25
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:04,919
it's time for the media to ask questions,

26
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:05,840
Hello, Mr. Long.

27
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,319
I'm a reporter from Ocean Current Criticism.

28
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,280
I want to ask you

29
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,199
why you chose

30
00:04:09,199 --> 00:04:10,719
the new energy vehicle manufacturing industry,

31
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:14,560
The era of traditional car transformation has arrived.

32
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,959
I believe the same goes for new energy vehicles.

33
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:19,800
It's exactly the same as

34
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:20,720
when we use mobile phones and tablets.

35
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:23,439
I believe the cars of the future

36
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:24,560
are not necessarily electric,

37
00:04:25,079 --> 00:04:26,680
But it must be smart.

38
00:04:28,439 --> 00:04:29,639
The entire automotive industry

39
00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:31,199
is in a critical period of transformation,

40
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:32,720
Long Group

41
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,199
chose to enter at this time.

42
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:35,879
It's what the times need.

43
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:37,120
I'm so looking forward to it.

44
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,959
Yiyi, we love you.

45
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:40,160
Yiyi, I like you so much.

46
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,079
Yiyi, I really like you.

47
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,399
Yiyi has been in love with you for a long time,

48
00:04:44,079 --> 00:04:45,399
when will it come to me?

49
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:53,439
Thank you.

50
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,000
Yiyi, Yiyi,

51
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,199
I'm a big fan of yours.

52
00:04:58,639 --> 00:04:59,560
When I bought milk tea

53
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,319
with illustrations in your shop,

54
00:05:01,399 --> 00:05:03,279
I didn't expect you to become a cartoonist?

55
00:05:03,439 --> 00:05:04,120
Really?

56
00:05:04,279 --> 00:05:05,720
Then we are really destined to be together.

57
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,079
Here you are.

58
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,639
Yiyi, I'll keep it well.

59
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,759
I'll always support you, Yiyi.

60
00:05:12,839 --> 00:05:13,399
Thank you.

61
00:05:15,519 --> 00:05:16,040
Yiyi,

62
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,680
I love the Long Yi you drew.

63
00:05:17,959 --> 00:05:20,000
Can you draw a portrait of Long Yi for me?

64
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,240
Okay.

65
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,199
Long time no see, Long Yi.

66
00:05:57,839 --> 00:05:58,120
Hey,

67
00:05:58,279 --> 00:05:59,439
Yiyi, where are you?

68
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,199
The management has been here

69
00:06:00,199 --> 00:06:00,800
for three minutes,

70
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:01,759
I'll be there soon.

71
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,279
You made me look so ugly.

72
00:06:41,879 --> 00:06:43,120
Zhang Jingmei,

73
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,399
you can write such a thing.

74
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:49,319
Brother,

75
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,040
This comic book is very popular.

76
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:54,759
Yes, yes, yes. It's this one.

77
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,000
Millions of fans.

78
00:06:58,319 --> 00:06:59,199
What does it have to do with me?

79
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,399
We also expressed our sincerity.

80
00:07:04,519 --> 00:07:05,800
I hope you can consider our proposal.

81
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:09,720
We had a nice chat today.

82
00:07:09,879 --> 00:07:11,480
I hope I can get your reply as soon as possible.

83
00:07:11,959 --> 00:07:12,160
Okay?

84
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:12,639
Okay,

85
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:13,560
thank you for your hard work.

86
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,000
-See you later. -Okay.

87
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:14,839
We'll leave now.

88
00:07:15,319 --> 00:07:15,639
Bye.

89
00:07:15,639 --> 00:07:16,040
Goodbye.

90
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,040
Lesheng's film and television is pretty good.

91
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:30,879
What do you think?

92
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,560
Let's think about it.

93
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:35,519
Yiyi,

94
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:37,680
we've met so many investors in the past two months,

95
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,519
Every time you said you'd think about it.

96
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,199
You don't want to sell it, do you?

97
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,160
No,

98
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,160
they're willing to pay 6million yuan for the copyright,

99
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,360
It's already high.

100
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,720
Now that your comics are at their peak,

101
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,199
if you keep dragging it on,

102
00:07:50,399 --> 00:07:51,800
Wait for other homogeneous works to come out.

103
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:52,680
The market recognition

104
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,959
will not be as high as it is now.

105
00:07:55,399 --> 00:07:56,120
Jialin,

106
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,959
you know what it means to me.

107
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,399
I understand.

108
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,759
You're just a literary youth.

109
00:08:05,879 --> 00:08:06,920
It's not suitable for business at all.

110
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,240
That's why I need you more.

111
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:14,160
You can't forget Long Yi at all,

112
00:08:16,519 --> 00:08:18,399
he can only break free from my bondage,

113
00:08:18,759 --> 00:08:20,319
So that you can fly higher and farther.

114
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:23,040
You're practically related to Yu Haoqiu.

115
00:08:24,519 --> 00:08:26,279
Young artists like you need to be cured,

116
00:08:26,279 --> 00:08:27,240
you know?

117
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,399
Okay.

118
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,279
Long time no see,

119
00:08:45,799 --> 00:08:46,759
Mr. Long. I missed you so much.

120
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,320
You think I'm fake,

121
00:08:49,679 --> 00:08:50,919
but you think this is real.

122
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,559
It's better to be my own brother.

123
00:08:55,559 --> 00:08:56,320
Thanks to you this time.

124
00:08:57,039 --> 00:08:58,200
Master Kitano is modest,

125
00:08:58,759 --> 00:09:01,120
but you bought it with all your wealth.

126
00:09:01,799 --> 00:09:02,799
I'm just building a bridge.

127
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:03,720
Nothing.

128
00:09:04,639 --> 00:09:05,519
I'm flattered.

129
00:09:05,759 --> 00:09:06,759
It's only 90%.

130
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:09,799
First of all,

131
00:09:10,279 --> 00:09:11,799
I want a 10% share.

132
00:09:12,159 --> 00:09:13,799
I'll have to check the financial report then.

133
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,799
After all, I don't trust you.

134
00:09:17,919 --> 00:09:20,080
I only trust my female brother Chen Xuanyi.

135
00:09:23,799 --> 00:09:24,360
Long Yi,

136
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,919
you're getting more and more cunning.

137
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,759
I'm doing business.

138
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:39,519
Hey,

139
00:09:39,759 --> 00:09:39,919
Here.

140
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:42,080
Hey, bro,

141
00:09:43,039 --> 00:09:44,759
How's it going,

142
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:45,720
African lion man?

143
00:09:48,679 --> 00:09:49,200
Nice hair.

144
00:09:49,679 --> 00:09:50,360
Does it look good?

145
00:09:50,759 --> 00:09:51,440
Your hair is beautiful.

146
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,519
I don't know if your alcohol consumption has gone up.

147
00:09:53,039 --> 00:09:54,440
Whether you can drink or not,

148
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,000
you'll find out after you try.

149
00:09:56,039 --> 00:09:56,879
Try it.

150
00:09:57,919 --> 00:09:58,480
Waiter,

151
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,039
three bottles of Manhattan and ten bottles of Bilson.

152
00:10:08,559 --> 00:10:08,919
Come on,

153
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,080
Drink it.

154
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:21,159
Wave.

155
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,600
With your hair,

156
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,840
you're going to spend the rest of your life with a lion.

157
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,559
What's wrong with living with a lion?

158
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:35,279
Lion at least has feelings and temperature,

159
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:37,519
in the past year,

160
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:40,200
With the car battery.

161
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:42,799
You're exaggerating.

162
00:10:47,159 --> 00:10:49,840
I slept with the steering wheel in my arms.

163
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,279
Come on, let's go.

164
00:11:02,519 --> 00:11:02,919
Telephone

165
00:11:06,919 --> 00:11:07,480
What are

166
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:10,960
you doing?

167
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,200
It's been a year,

168
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,960
and you're still competing with your dad?

169
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,679
He'll figure it out.

170
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,639
Have a good talk with your father.

171
00:11:22,159 --> 00:11:23,120
-How old are

172
00:11:23,679 --> 00:11:24,600
you? -Yes,

173
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:25,799
Besides,

174
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,960
your last name isn't really Chen,

175
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:30,799
I'm telling you,

176
00:11:31,559 --> 00:11:34,120
I cheated Luo out of half of his property.

177
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:37,480
He can't wait to beat me until I change my surname.

178
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:41,919
If I were your dad,

179
00:11:43,399 --> 00:11:44,080
I'd feel bad too.

180
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:45,159
Get lost!

181
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:47,159
Who are you taking advantage of?

182
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,120
Does Chen Xuanyi know?

183
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,080
Long Yi,

184
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,240
you've been back

185
00:12:01,639 --> 00:12:02,480
for so long,

186
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:03,879
I don't know if I'm going to see Zhang Jingmei

187
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,039
and his friends,

188
00:12:15,639 --> 00:12:16,480
While you're all here,

189
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:20,720
I have to help my brother catch up with the progress.

190
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,080
What progress?

191
00:12:29,799 --> 00:12:31,279
Hello, dear Xuanyi, it's 8: 00 p. m. Beijing

192
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:33,799
time,

193
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:36,200
Remember to have dinner with Kitano Master.

194
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:12,840
Please play

195
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:14,279
Diabulus In Musica,

196
00:13:14,279 --> 00:13:14,799
Lonly soul,

197
00:13:14,799 --> 00:13:15,120
thank you.

198
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:18,360
Mr. Chen,

199
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,360
two lonely souls are together.

200
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,320
I don't think this song is very good.

201
00:13:26,679 --> 00:13:27,320
Please play

202
00:13:27,879 --> 00:13:28,519
Mary Johnson's song,

203
00:13:29,679 --> 00:13:30,360
When I fall in love

204
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:54,840
What the hell is going on, man?

205
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,440
Get out of the car now.

206
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,919
I'll arrange it if it's okay.

207
00:14:06,919 --> 00:14:07,720
I didn't expect that

208
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:08,559
there would be a rear-end collision today.

209
00:14:16,679 --> 00:14:17,080
I'm sorry.

210
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,600
Who let our car park here?

211
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,679
Let's just have a meal here.

212
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:22,960
We're already here. Let's go.

213
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:29,240
This mall has become so depressed

214
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,360
since then.

215
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:31,720
Maybe it's not in the right hands.

216
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:33,519
Don't think too much about leaving.

217
00:14:36,279 --> 00:14:37,679
Isn't this your work?

218
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:39,720
This is a sister article,

219
00:14:40,559 --> 00:14:41,480
if you look at this angle carefully,

220
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:42,840
And the hollowed-out below. Do you

221
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:44,639
see the difference?

222
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,039
Let's go.

223
00:14:48,039 --> 00:14:48,759
Hello,

224
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,240
look here. Look here.

225
00:14:50,519 --> 00:14:52,639
Come and try our Drunken Shrimp Drunken Crab,

226
00:14:52,759 --> 00:14:54,799
marinated with mellow yellow wine,

227
00:14:54,919 --> 00:14:56,799
Nourishing and diminishing inflammation,

228
00:14:56,799 --> 00:14:59,360
why do I feel this picture is a bit familiar?

229
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:00,720
That's right.

230
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,279
This picture looks so alike.

231
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:05,200
It's in line with my hard journey of chasing you.

232
00:15:05,919 --> 00:15:07,600
It must be your cheeky steps.

233
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:09,840
Let's go

234
00:15:10,559 --> 00:15:11,399
Don't you want some?

235
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:13,039
It's nourishing.

236
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:22,919
True love?

237
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:26,879
Why is it here?

238
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,480
Omi's Ferris wheel?

239
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:01,639
2046,

240
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:02,919
Luo Beichen,

241
00:16:02,919 --> 00:16:03,960
What are you up to now?

242
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:17,320
What is this?

243
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,080
I'm sorry, Mr. Chen,

244
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:26,200
but without your permission,

245
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,639
I made these designs in your mall without permission.

246
00:16:29,799 --> 00:16:30,639
This authorization contract

247
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:31,960
needs to be re-signed.

248
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:34,799
What authorization contract? Your father

249
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:38,120
once made Aixuan City for you

250
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:39,360
to protect you.

251
00:16:40,919 --> 00:16:41,559
From now on,

252
00:16:43,159 --> 00:16:44,000
let me, Luo Beichen,

253
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:45,360
And this city,

254
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,200
let's protect you together.

255
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:05,799
Chen Xuanyi,

256
00:17:06,759 --> 00:17:07,240
I love you.

257
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:08,839
Will you marry me?

258
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:17,279
How did you do that?

259
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:20,759
Mr. Chen, I'm proposing.

260
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:09,119
What are you two

261
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:10,480
doing?

262
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:12,640
Congratulations, Chen Xuanyi,

263
00:18:14,039 --> 00:18:15,799
but after you get married,

264
00:18:15,799 --> 00:18:16,839
You'll still come to work.

265
00:18:17,119 --> 00:18:18,519
I don't feel at ease.

266
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,160
He just handed over the business to Luo Beichen.

267
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:25,359
The three of us didn't come at the right time.

268
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:26,079
Keep kissing.

269
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,200
We'll applaud you next to you. Get lost.

270
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,000
Come on, roll.

271
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:32,119
Happy wedding! Happy wedding!

272
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:38,559
Don't leave the baby who comes to the live broadcast room,

273
00:18:38,599 --> 00:18:40,000
click on the top to pay attention,

274
00:18:40,759 --> 00:18:42,559
Thank you for your gift.

275
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:45,440
What I'm wearing today,

276
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:48,200
is something with some Chinese elements,

277
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:49,240
Personally,

278
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:51,359
I like some national fashions very much.

279
00:18:51,359 --> 00:18:52,680
The style of Chinese elements,

280
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:55,000
I'm very supportive of our Chinese culture,

281
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,359
How are the copyrights of your comics going?

282
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:59,119
So I bought a lot of clothes.

283
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,359
When Yiyi figured it out,

284
00:19:01,599 --> 00:19:03,359
the comic book would be as cold

285
00:19:03,759 --> 00:19:04,599
as this cup of milk tea.

286
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:06,519
Thank you. Thank you for the gift from the baby.

287
00:19:06,519 --> 00:19:08,519
Yu Haoqiu, go! Why are you hiding?

288
00:19:08,519 --> 00:19:10,160
If you follow me in my live streaming room,

289
00:19:10,759 --> 00:19:12,799
can you stop following me?

290
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:14,880
Can you develop yourself?

291
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:15,559
I won't follow you.

292
00:19:15,759 --> 00:19:16,960
I'll be dead soon.

293
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:17,960
Just die.

294
00:19:18,079 --> 00:19:19,559
You'll die hundreds of times.

295
00:19:19,799 --> 00:19:20,759
How can I become a Great God?

296
00:19:21,519 --> 00:19:23,559
Calcium milk, let's not take him with us. Let's drive.

297
00:19:23,759 --> 00:19:25,480
No, no, no. Wait for me. My card is stuck.

298
00:19:25,559 --> 00:19:26,079
Wait! Wait!

299
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:26,400
Jialin,

300
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:27,839
what are you doing?

301
00:19:28,079 --> 00:19:28,680
I've made up my mind.

302
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:29,759
I don't want to sell the copyright anymore.

303
00:19:30,079 --> 00:19:30,720
Let's do it ourselves.

304
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:32,759
Take a photo by yourself.

305
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:33,440
That's right.

306
00:19:34,039 --> 00:19:35,480
This is my own story.

307
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:37,039
I can't give it to someone else

308
00:19:37,079 --> 00:19:38,000
just for its safety.

309
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:39,559
Just die.

310
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:41,480
Pei pei pei.

311
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:42,720
It's going to be a big fire, okay?

312
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:46,680
What is it?

313
00:19:47,359 --> 00:19:49,359
Sisters are of one mind. Don't run away.

314
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:52,480
What are you talking about?

315
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:54,880
Hello, Mr. Gong

316
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:55,200
and Mr. Yu,

317
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:55,519
Please come in.

318
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:56,240
Please follow me.

319
00:19:57,039 --> 00:19:57,359
Hello.

320
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:01,279
-You're here. -Mr. Dong, please

321
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:02,240
come in.

322
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:03,000
Okay,

323
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:05,680
Please welcome all the guests inside

324
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,160
Hello,

325
00:20:14,359 --> 00:20:15,960
I'm Zhang Jingmei from Miyou Pictures,

326
00:20:16,359 --> 00:20:17,759
and on behalf of Miyou Pictures,

327
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:19,599
I sincerely welcome you all.

328
00:20:22,119 --> 00:20:22,440
That's great.

329
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:23,519
That's great.

330
00:20:24,119 --> 00:20:25,799
The project we're going to invest in today

331
00:20:25,839 --> 00:20:28,319
is the comic book Long Yi You're dead

332
00:20:29,319 --> 00:20:31,160
This comic book means a lot to me,

333
00:20:31,319 --> 00:20:32,319
Not only has it brought

334
00:20:32,319 --> 00:20:33,880
a lot of fans who love it,

335
00:20:34,319 --> 00:20:35,279
More importantly,

336
00:20:35,279 --> 00:20:36,400
it recorded one of

337
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:38,599
my most valuable experiences,

338
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,640
It's also the whole of my youth.

339
00:20:44,079 --> 00:20:46,240
Let me introduce the share of investment promotion.

340
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:47,559
Miss Zhang Jingmei,

341
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,640
isn't this Long Yi from Long Group?

342
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:51,720
Yeah, he's here, too.

343
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,880
The comics you published have been seriously infringed.

344
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:02,000
Besides,

345
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:05,440
it's inappropriate to paint me so ugly.

346
00:21:06,519 --> 00:21:07,920
So handsome.

347
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,720
He's still Long Yi

348
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:20,279
Long Yi Long Yi Long time no see,

349
00:21:21,359 --> 00:21:23,240
Zhang Jingmei, are you okay?

350
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:25,319
Three conditions,

351
00:21:26,759 --> 00:21:27,079
Tell me,

352
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:30,279
First,

353
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:32,319
we don't have a divorce certificate,

354
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:34,480
So legally speaking,

355
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:35,799
we belong to a marriage relationship,

356
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:38,880
Your cartoon belongs to marital property,

357
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:41,880
I have the right to monitor every interest link.

358
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:43,720
Go on.

359
00:21:44,839 --> 00:21:45,279
Second,

360
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,839
Long Yi's cartoon image,

361
00:21:48,039 --> 00:21:49,039
I can give it to you.

362
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:50,240
But,

363
00:21:52,039 --> 00:21:53,480
I have to be a part of it.

364
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:56,559
And have the right to comment on the production.

365
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,920
Including the film and television production process,

366
00:21:58,920 --> 00:21:59,920
I also want to review them one by one.

367
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:01,759
Third,

368
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:03,640
Third.

369
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:08,799
Third,

370
00:22:10,039 --> 00:22:11,519
I'll tell you when I think it over.

371
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:12,640
Okay,

372
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:15,680
First,

373
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,799
the copyright of this comic is me and Xiaoxiao,

374
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:20,319
And Jialin owns it together,

375
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:22,559
so the marital property you're talking about,

376
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,160
Only the part that belongs to me.

377
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,160
In other words,

378
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:27,519
you only account for a small proportion of the shares.

379
00:22:28,079 --> 00:22:29,079
Why?

380
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:31,839
Me,

381
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:32,960
Okay,

382
00:22:34,599 --> 00:22:35,160
Second,

383
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:36,720
regarding the image of the cartoon,

384
00:22:36,839 --> 00:22:37,920
You have the right to comment,

385
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,079
but as an author,

386
00:22:39,519 --> 00:22:41,519
The final choice lies with me.

387
00:22:41,759 --> 00:22:42,400
In other words,

388
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:43,720
you can give your opinions,

389
00:22:44,039 --> 00:22:45,480
I don't want to hear it.

390
00:22:46,039 --> 00:22:47,240
You're going too far.

391
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:48,359
Forget it if you can't.

392
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:48,640
Okay,

393
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:49,279
Third,

394
00:22:49,279 --> 00:22:50,319
I didn't say third,

395
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:51,039
The third is that

396
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:52,880
I don't have to agree to your third condition,

397
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:54,960
It's okay.

398
00:22:55,119 --> 00:22:56,079
You can think about it.

399
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:03,640
Mr. Zhang, happy to work with you.

400
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:11,839
Happy cooperation.
