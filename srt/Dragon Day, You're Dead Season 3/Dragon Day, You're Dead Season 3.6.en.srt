and got on two hot searches.

90
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:40,040
How handsome a woman

91

is to compete with Long Yi.

00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,820
I don't want to rob you.

93

I'm stuck in a hospital ward by reporters.

I dare not go out.

95

I'm afraid that if I say one wrong word,

96

Mr. Long will kill me.

97

What are you afraid of?

98
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:50,590
No matter how powerful Young Master Long is,

99
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:52,100
isn't he just a playboy?

100
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:54,520
The Long family didn't enter the entertainment industry.

101
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:57,230
You're barefoot. You're not afraid to wear shoes.

The bigger it gets,

103

the better it will be for you.

104

Then you have to help me.

105
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:03,290
No problem.

106
00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:04,370
-Help each other. -Okay, I'm

107
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:07,780
hanging up.

108
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:09,150
Man Fei,

109
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:10,540
I heard Young Master Long was fighting with Meng Hao,

110
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:11,680
Because of an actress,

111
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:12,700
you were there.

112
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:13,680
What's going on?

113
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:17,400
I can only say that we are all sentimental people.

114
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:21,550
There are some things that I hope you can understand.

115
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:22,590
Sister Man Fei,

116
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:24,100
are you the actress Mr. Long is protecting?

117
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:24,540
Man Fei,

118
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:25,690
do you know Mr. Long?

119
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:28,090
Sorry,

120
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:29,820
there are some things that I can't respond to.

121
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:32,570
I think it's better for you to ask me.

122
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:34,320
Man Fei,

123
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:34,890
I'm sorry,

Sister Fei is still filming,

125
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:38,960
Long Yi is visiting the class,

126
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:39,980
Whose class?

127
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:41,120
Do I have to ask?

128
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,580
Who is worth visiting Mr. Long?

129
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:44,550
Deng Manfei

130
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:50,160
(outpatient and inpatient)

131
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,260
Come out.

132
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:55,250
-I'm not going. -Zhang Jingmei, Zhang

133
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:56,040
Jingmei,

134
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:58,070
Can you stop being willful?

135
00:04:58,070 --> 00:04:58,910
This is a big deal.

136
00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:00,380
It's not good for you either.

137
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:01,780
I repeat, Zhang Jingmei,

138
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:02,590
I'm not willful.

139
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:03,780
This is the principle.

140
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:04,880
If you beat someone up,

141
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:05,740
it's only right

142
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:06,980
to apologize to them.

143
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:08,180
What does it have to do with principles?

144
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:09,060
Did he hit you?

145
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,410
I'm working,

146
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:11,740
I'm acting.

147
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:12,990
Do you really have to fight in an act?

148
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:14,330
What's wrong with your arm?

149
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:17,510
It's just a skin injury. It doesn't hurt.

150
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:18,340
I do.

151
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:20,350
Zhang Jingmei, let me tell you,

152
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:21,730
in this world,

153
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:22,990
I won't allow anyone

154
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:24,130
to touch your finger,

155
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:27,200
Don't you have a solution

156
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,780
other than violence?

157
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:29,420
No.

158
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:32,090
Long Yi,

159
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,730
I won't apologize anyway.

160
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:37,430
Okay, I'll go.

161
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:39,120
You're not allowed

162

to go either,

163
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,720
I have to rely on this wave of heat

164

165

00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:55,150
He was used as a gun.

168
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:56,980
You're still complacent.

169
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:58,520
Why did you become a gun?

170
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:00,160
I'm the one who's on the hot searches now.

171
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,130
It's not Deng Man Fei.

172
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:05,820
You're quite proud.

173
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,130
(Deng Manfei's crew caused a dispute and two men fought for it)

174
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:08,860
We're not helping each other.

175
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:09,640
It's a win-win situation.

176
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:13,550
No one can save you.

177
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:24,200
I'm here to apologize.

178
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,290
Why are you apologizing?

179
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:26,320
Where's Long Yi?

180
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:37,460
I'm Long Yi's wife.

181
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:38,490
I can represent him.

182
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:42,190
Long Yi hit you

183
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:43,160
on impulse.

184
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:45,060
I apologize on his behalf.

185
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,100
We'll be fully responsible for

186
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:52,310
your treatment and lost time.

187
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:54,430
I hope you won't argue with him.

188
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:58,920
I wonder if this is Mrs. Long's idea,

189
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:00,740
or Mr. Long's idea?

190
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:02,700
What do we mean?

191
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:04,700
What is this?

192
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:07,670
If you want to apologize, you should at least post a statement on the internet,

193
00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:09,670
Long Yi admits his mistake,

194
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:10,740
Apologize to Meng Hao,

195
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:12,900
Mr. Meng,

196
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,420
You know the Long family won't let Long Yi

197
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:16,540
make such a statement.

198
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:19,550
And if you fight in the crew,

199
00:07:20,010 --> 00:07:21,280
I'm afraid it's not good for you.

200
00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:22,630
Look,

201
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:24,220
can we discuss it?

202
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:25,740
Think of it as an accidental injury during filming.

203
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:26,830
Accidental injury.

204
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:29,130
My chest is still stuffy and I can't breathe.

205
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:30,520
Don't think I'll be afraid of you

206
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:31,360
if I carry you out of the Long family.

207
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,350
Mr. Meng,

208
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:36,430
I didn't know that you, as the star of a play,

209
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:38,040
Why did you deliberately hit a stand-in

210
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,890
that you've never met?

211
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:41,220
Outside this door,

212
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:42,950
I can say that I was accidentally injured during filming.

213
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:45,230
But if you insist on making a big deal out of it,

214
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:49,180
I've already done the injury identification.

215
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,490
(Certificate of diagnosis: Zhang Jingmei's forearm fracture, soft tissue contusion), (Plaster-wrapped medication, need

216
00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:55,440
to be hospitalized for rest)

217
00:07:56,910 --> 00:07:58,580
You're Long Yi's wife?

218
00:07:58,580 --> 00:07:59,360
Where's your evidence?

219
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,040
Who would believe it?

220
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:01,100
Mr. Meng,

221
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:03,420
if you hadn't beaten Long Yi's wife,

222
00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:04,750
Why would he hit you?

223
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:06,090
I'm just acting as usual.

224
00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:07,880
How do I know you're Long Yi's wife?

225
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:10,160
So if I'm not Long Yi's wife,

226
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,140
can you bully

227
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:12,470
a stuntman at will?

228
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:22,610
Mrs. Long,

229
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:24,980
actually, you're so smart,

230
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:26,350
I should have known it a long time ago.

231
00:08:27,010 --> 00:08:28,350
Meng Hao was misled

232
00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:30,040
when he hit you.

233
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:34,760
If you are misled,

234
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,280
you must tie the bell to solve it.

235
00:08:36,970 --> 00:08:39,070
Mrs. Long, can't you guess who it is?

236
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:57,690
Sorry,

237
00:08:57,690 --> 00:08:59,600
there are some things that I can't respond to.

238
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:02,000
I think it's better for you to ask me.

239
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:11,840
Where did she go?

240
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:12,850
Jingmei,

241
00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:15,340
is Yi really fighting with someone in the crew?

242
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:17,180
He said it was for an actress.

243
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:18,190
Sis,

244
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:19,630
Is Deng Man Fei pretty in person?

245
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:24,130
It wasn't Deng Manfei who was beaten, it was me.

246
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:24,870
You,

247
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:27,150
Where did you get hurt?

248
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:28,930
Does it hurt?

249
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,160
Isn't that bullying?

250
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,550
Luckily, Xiaoyi is here.

251
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:34,220
No one bullied me.

252
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:36,150
It's just an accidental injury in acting.

253
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:36,640
Look,

254
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:37,710
isn't this great?

255
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:39,160
Brother-in-law is so handsome.

256
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:41,240
What's so handsome about him?

257
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:43,980
I was so annoyed that I didn't answer my phone for a long time.

258
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:47,600
Tell me,

259
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:50,240
how could she suffer so much?

260
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,560
You can take it.

261
00:09:52,970 --> 00:09:54,630
It's all Zhang Jingmei's fault.

262
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:55,390
It's all her fault.

263
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:56,420
Bullshit!

264
00:09:57,590 --> 00:09:59,310
Zhang Jingmei is beautiful,

265
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:02,810
Zhang Jingmei is good everywhere,

266
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:06,550
Zhang Jingmei is very good,

267
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:07,470
very good,

268
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:08,770
Then tell me,

269
00:10:08,770 --> 00:10:10,500
how could she suffer so much?

270
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,650
You can take it.

271
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:13,820
Yi,

272
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,420
can you say something else?

273
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:18,500
I can't even recite your words now.

274
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,400
Zhang Jingmei is beautiful,

275
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:23,820
Zhang Jingmei is good everywhere,

276
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,200
Then tell me,

277
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:29,150
how could she suffer so much?

278
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:30,940
You're so tolerant.

279
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:36,290
Zhang Jing is beautiful.

280
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:44,710
You guys drink it,

281
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:45,510
you guys drink it,

282
00:10:47,170 --> 00:10:48,270
Beichen.

283
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:53,620
What a coincidence.

284
00:10:55,770 --> 00:10:56,910
Thank you for the cake last time.

285
00:10:58,540 --> 00:10:59,620
How about I buy you a drink?

286
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:01,560
Thanks. You don't have to

287
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:04,600
play dice,

288
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:06,620
Who gets the most points and listens to whom?

289
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:11,240
It's boring for us to compete with each other.

290
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,130
We're younger than each other.

291
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:14,740
I'm younger than you.

292
00:11:15,290 --> 00:11:16,150
I'm willing to admit defeat.

293
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:43,500
You're handsome again.

294
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:45,500
You're so sweet-tongued.

295
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:47,220
I'm so old,

296
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:48,300
Why are you so handsome?

297
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:48,980
In my heart,

298
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:50,050
you will always be the most handsome,

299
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:51,760
-Let's go. -Okay.

300
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:56,450
I'll go.

301
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:58,350
What's going on?

302
00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:01,200
Am I ugly?

303
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,690
Yeah, you're so ugly.

304
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:03,610
-What are you doing? -Come on. (I'm

305
00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:08,440
sorry. ),

306
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:11,520
(The subscriber you dialed cannot be connected at the moment. )

307
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:12,830
(Please redial later. ).

308
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:13,810
Sis,

309
00:12:13,810 --> 00:12:15,200
Brother-in-law is really not coming to pick you up?

310
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:18,540
(I'm sorry)

311
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:20,520
Sister, did you play it now?

312
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:22,660
I thought about making a scene and acting coquettish,

313
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:25,080
but people ignored you,

314
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:27,390
(The subscriber you dialed cannot be connected at the moment. ),

315
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:27,780
Get lost!

316
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:28,760
Where am I going?

317
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:30,190
You're sleeping in my bed.

318
00:12:30,190 --> 00:12:31,650
This is still my room?

319
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:32,920
Move all your things out.

320
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:34,210
You're the one who should move out, right?

321
00:12:34,210 --> 00:12:35,780
You're a married girl.

322
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:40,580
You're not moving back again, are you?

323
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:45,040
Why don't I call my brother-in-law?

324
00:12:45,210 --> 00:12:46,920
I think your skin is itchy.

325
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:51,760
Brother,

326
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:53,500
If sister-in-law asks,

327
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:54,910
you stayed at my house last night,

328
00:13:57,230 --> 00:13:58,270
Why?

329
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:04,960
Feed cuttlefish?

330
00:14:05,370 --> 00:14:05,920
Brother,

331
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:06,940
I finally found you.

332
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:07,980
If sister-in-law asks,

333
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:09,120
did you stay at my house last night?

334
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,110
No, no, no, no, no, no, no,

335
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:12,670
no, no, no, no. Please make it clear.

336
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:14,250
What? I'll stay in your house.

337
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:15,400
All right, all right, stop it.

338
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,400
-I'm in a meeting. -Hang

339
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:23,700
up. No.

340
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:29,480
Yi,

341
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,340
if Jingmei asks about it,

342
00:14:32,850 --> 00:14:34,260
We didn't drink yesterday. We sang

343
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:35,540
all night at KTV,

344
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:36,580
Don't let it slip.

345
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:37,670
Wait,

346
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:39,060
what Jingmei?

347
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:41,660
When I called you last night, I turned off your phone

348
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:43,300
because I thought it was too noisy.

349
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:49,100
I'm dead then.

350
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:04,420
Hey, honey,

351
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:05,990
you were busy last night,

352
00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:07,220
No, no, no. Honey,

353
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:08,390
listen to my sophistry. I

354
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:09,890
blame both of them.

355
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:11,550
If you ask me to drink,

356
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:12,680
there's nothing I can do.

357
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:13,940
You drank too? -I … I … I … I …-I can't

358
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:16,580
be saved.

359
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:19,380
What should I do?

360
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,090
Honey,

361
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:23,900
I'm fine. Stop it.

362
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:24,760
Grandpa is back.

363
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:26,530
Uncle Li asked us to have dinner together.

364
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:27,790
Okay, honey.

365
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:29,540
I'll pick you up.

366
00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:36,420
Oh no.

367
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:45,000
It's all over.

368
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:49,490
Go get your sister breakfast.

369
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:52,630
Stop yelling.

370
00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:54,700
Your sister didn't sleep until midnight last night.

371
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:56,090
No way.

372
00:15:56,090 --> 00:15:56,990
I have to ask her.

373
00:15:56,990 --> 00:15:59,000
What's going on with Yi?

374
00:15:59,970 --> 00:16:00,570
Go get her

375
00:16:03,010 --> 00:16:04,630
About the couple fighting,

376
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:05,540
that's all,

377
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:07,300
How could you quarrel like this when you just got married?

378
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:09,130
One goes back to her mother's house

379
00:16:09,930 --> 00:16:10,480
and the other doesn't contact her.

380
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:11,670
I said,

381
00:16:12,330 --> 00:16:13,980
don't get involved in the child's matter.

382
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:14,720
Okay?

383
00:16:15,650 --> 00:16:16,300
Let's eat.

384
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:21,600
Let's eat.

385
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:26,390
Let's eat.

386
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:44,020
You've been busy lately.

387
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:45,020
No, no, no.

388
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:46,320
You're not busy if you're not busy.

389
00:16:47,130 --> 00:16:50,410
When you get married and make a scandal,

390
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:54,400
you are really willful.

391
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:57,540
Grandpa,

392
00:16:58,250 --> 00:16:59,870
I want to hold a wedding.

393
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:06,590
How dare you hold a wedding?

394
00:17:07,130 --> 00:17:09,050
Is it time for the wedding?

395
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:11,660
What's wrong?

396
00:17:14,050 --> 00:17:17,320
You have to pay attention to your priorities.

397
00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:19,540
Tell me first,

398
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:22,150
how are you going to put this scandal to rest.

399
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:26,070
I … I'm holding a wedding. Rumors won't come to light,

400
00:17:26,070 --> 00:17:28,500
Grandpa.

401
00:17:33,810 --> 00:17:35,020
You had a wedding.

402
00:17:35,330 --> 00:17:37,360
The topic of the scandal will become

403
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:42,850
Long Yi's cheating actress on the eve of her wedding.

404
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:53,000
(Longhao Hotel)-Miss

405
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,100
Chen, please. -Thank you.

406
00:17:56,440 --> 00:18:03,480
(Longhao Hotel)

407
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:06,740
That won't do. I,

408
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:07,650
Alright,

409
00:18:09,010 --> 00:18:10,640
Haiyi is leaving tonight.

410
00:18:11,010 --> 00:18:12,760
Chen Xuanyi came to our Long Family

411
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:14,380
to talk about the Long Chen Foundation,

412
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:16,850
Who is in contact with her in the Long family?

413
00:18:16,850 --> 00:18:18,400
Isn't my dad coming back next week?

414
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:18,940
Silly,

415
00:18:21,910 --> 00:18:23,580
is Xuanyi here for your dad?

416
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:26,680
You can't come at me. Grandpa, Jingmei

417
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,380
and I both got our certificates.

418
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:30,210
That's why you have to

419
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:31,360
deal with Xuan Yi.

420
00:18:32,050 --> 00:18:33,180
I don't care.

421
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:34,180
I only want Zhang Jingmei.

422
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:35,090
Who told you to

423
00:18:37,490 --> 00:18:38,930
We're already married.

424
00:18:38,930 --> 00:18:41,160
Why can't you grow up?

425
00:18:41,490 --> 00:18:42,080
Tell me,

426
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:44,040
what is the essence of doing business?

427
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:44,570
win-win situation

428
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:48,210
No one can open a shop without a smiling face,

429
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,540
but he will play the round and fall off the stage,

430
00:18:50,850 --> 00:18:51,550
What

431
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:55,850
a win-win.

432
00:18:55,850 --> 00:18:56,580
Gosh.

433
00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:06,300
Miss Chen, please wait a moment.

434
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:06,760
Thank you.

435
00:19:09,130 --> 00:19:09,780
Mr. Long.

436
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:14,390
If you're in a bad mood,

437
00:19:14,390 --> 00:19:15,500
don't ask,

438
00:19:17,350 --> 00:19:18,670
Did Grandpa scold you?

439
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:22,010
I don't know how much Grandpa likes me.

440
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:26,240
You're 25 years old,

441
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:27,690
can you stop acting like

442
00:19:27,690 --> 00:19:29,140
a kindergarten class every day,

443
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:30,300
Long Yi, whether you're childish or not,

444
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:33,010
we're all born the same way.

445
00:19:33,010 --> 00:19:33,960
Can you stop

446
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,540
acting like someone is more mature than anyone else?

447
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:37,330
Is it interesting?

448
00:19:37,330 --> 00:19:38,540
Anyway, I remember someone said,

449
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:39,920
at the age of 25, she wants to marry

450
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:44,210
my elder sister,

451
00:19:45,430 --> 00:19:47,260
Do you still remember what happened when you were eight?

452
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:48,770
I'll learn from you. I'll remember it

453
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:49,670
for the rest of my life.

454
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:51,900
So when are you going to marry me?

455
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:02,300
Jingjing,

456
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:03,560
don't listen to her nonsense.

457
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:04,300
Me,

458
00:20:06,910 --> 00:20:08,140
Who is this?

459
00:20:11,690 --> 00:20:12,670
Who is this?

460
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:13,480
Zhang Jingmei,

461
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:14,710
Long Yi's wife.

462
00:20:18,810 --> 00:20:19,510
Chen Xuanyi,

463
00:20:20,570 --> 00:20:21,880
Long Yi's

464
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:25,590
good friend,

465
00:20:26,030 --> 00:20:26,640
Hello,

466
00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:27,590
Hello.

467
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:31,800
Grandpa,

468
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:32,660
Grandpa,

469
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:33,500
Hello, Grandpa.

470
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:35,990
You're all here.

471
00:20:45,730 --> 00:20:46,450
Have a seat.

472
00:20:48,530 --> 00:20:49,320
Tell the waiter. -Jingmei,

473
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:50,620
listen to me. -We're ready to serve.

474
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:52,330
He's really my brother.

475
00:20:52,550 --> 00:20:53,440
I'm not lying.

476
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:54,470
I know.

477
00:20:54,690 --> 00:20:55,660
Girl brother,

478
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:57,660
listen to Hai Yi,

479
00:20:58,670 --> 00:21:02,040
Xuanyi went to the company to hand it over,

480
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:02,810
Yes.

481
00:21:02,810 --> 00:21:05,010
The Longchen Foundation is about to be unveiled.

482
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:07,040
There are a lot of things to prepare.

483
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:09,510
Okay

484
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,410
(Long Shaonu beats two actors for one woman),

485
00:21:11,410 --> 00:21:12,520
Thank you for your hard work.

486
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:21,620
I heard that Jingmei

487
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:23,290
is also good in the cast,

488
00:21:23,290 --> 00:21:24,550
It's good, Grandpa.

489
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:30,770
It seems that you're the one who hasn't improved the most.

490
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:33,610
What's wrong with me?

491
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,260
You need to know who you are.

492
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:39,380
Everything you say and do represents the Long family,

493
00:21:41,290 --> 00:21:43,330
and now it's a critical moment

494
00:21:43,330 --> 00:21:44,990
for the Long Chen Foundation to establish itself,

495
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:48,100
I don't care how you're involved

496
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:49,720
with those actresses,

497
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:53,280
I hope that before the unveiling of the Longchen Foundation,

498
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:56,600
I don't want to hear

499
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:58,510
any more gossips.

500
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:06,900
Besides,

501
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:10,740
doesn't Jingmei have to continue working in the crew,

502
00:22:10,910 --> 00:22:11,660
Right?

503
00:22:12,330 --> 00:22:12,980
No, grandpa,

504
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:13,700
I'll say it again,

505
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:14,660
Me and those girls.

506
00:22:19,570 --> 00:22:20,070
I'm fine.

507
00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:25,860
Jing Mei,

508
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:27,120
Jing Mei,

509
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:29,470
She is a female brother of mine.

510
00:22:29,470 --> 00:22:31,080
That's what I said when I was a kid.

511
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:32,420
I can't take it seriously at all.

512
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:32,970
Really?

513
00:22:35,790 --> 00:22:37,440
She was born on the same day in the same year,

514
00:22:38,930 --> 00:22:40,610
which is purely coincidental.

515
00:22:40,610 --> 00:22:41,970
You two are destined to be together.

516
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:45,630
I need to clarify this.

517
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:48,100
This is the fate between my mother and her mother.

518
00:22:50,310 --> 00:22:51,790
I didn't go home last night.

519
00:22:51,790 --> 00:22:53,000
I went for a drink with my brother.

520
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:54,630
Yeah, no,

521
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:58,300
there's no female brother,

522
00:23:00,290 --> 00:23:01,730
Without Chen Xuanyi,

523
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:03,970
do you know that

524
00:23:03,970 --> 00:23:05,260
you didn't come home last night,

525
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:06,540
How worried am I?

526
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:07,220
Yes, yes, yes.

527
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:08,560
If you don't answer the phone again,

528
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:09,690
turn off your phone and I,

529
00:23:09,690 --> 00:23:10,610
I'm dead then.

530
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:13,680
Let's go.

531
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:19,700
About what Grandpa said just now,

532
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:20,740
what are you going to do?

533
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:23,170
He just said that.

534
00:23:23,170 --> 00:23:24,300
Just calm down.

535
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:25,570
It's not that simple.

536
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:26,590
Didn't you hear from Grandpa

537
00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:28,260
that the scandal will affect the fund's opening?

538
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:29,250
It's not that exaggerated.

539
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:30,030
First of all,

540
00:23:30,030 --> 00:23:31,660
(Longhao Hotel) I won't apologize to Meng Hao,

541
00:23:34,110 --> 00:23:36,210
How can I learn to grow up without apologizing?

542
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:39,180
Apologize and you'll grow up.

543
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:42,870
This is our ordinary life, young master

544
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:48,840
Hello Jialin,

545
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:49,750
Deng Manfei has an exclusive interview

546
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:51,080
with Apple at 3 pm.

547
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:51,990
I've sent you the location.

548
00:23:51,990 --> 00:23:52,700
It's up to you.

549
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:53,540
Okay, I got it.

550
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:55,790
I have something to do. I'm leaving.

551
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:56,890
Let me see you off.

552
00:23:57,090 --> 00:23:57,730
No need.

553
00:23:57,730 --> 00:23:58,430
About work,

554
00:23:58,430 --> 00:23:59,120
I'll go by myself.

555
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:04,380
Mr. Long,

556
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:05,540
happy wedding.

557
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:07,770
I'm envious.

558
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:09,520
If you envy me,

559
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:11,170
I can introduce you to a boyfriend.

560
00:24:11,170 --> 00:24:11,890
Nothing else,

561
00:24:12,530 --> 00:24:13,890
except that we have many brothers,

562
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:17,080
You're so casual in making friends.

563
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:18,500
I'd better be cautious.

564
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:22,880
(Longhao Hotel).

565
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:28,880
She's a witch.

566
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,550
An evil witch.

567
00:24:30,550 --> 00:24:32,860
She's an evil witch.

568
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:36,860
I'm coming.

569
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:40,630
I'll leave Deng Man Fei to you.

570
00:24:40,790 --> 00:24:41,650
Don't worry.

571
00:24:41,650 --> 00:24:43,030
After all, Old Hu still has a place

573
