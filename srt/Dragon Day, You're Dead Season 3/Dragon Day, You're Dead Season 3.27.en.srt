1
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:31,560
Sister Jing Mei.

2
00:02:32,039 --> 00:02:32,360
sister

3
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:33,439
You're finally here.

4
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,520
Hurry and take my place.

5
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,280
I have to play games.

6
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,240
Others are waiting for me.

7
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,280
Stop playing games.

8
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,280
Make me two cups of milk tea.

9
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,599
Your brother-in-law hasn't answered my calls all morning.

10
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:40,280
I'll send it to him.

11
00:02:42,759 --> 00:02:43,400
sister

12
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:45,280
You hurt your brother so early in the morning.

13
00:02:45,479 --> 00:02:46,400
And tortured a single dog.

14
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,240
Cut the crap. Hurry up.

15
00:02:51,879 --> 00:02:52,400
By the way,

16
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:53,520
That little lady.

17
00:02:54,439 --> 00:02:55,479
What about Jialin?

18
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,479
What do you want?

19
00:02:59,719 --> 00:03:00,000
Sixsixsix

20
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,400
Make milk tea for my brother-in-law.

21
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:02,240
good

22
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:02,800
Nothing

23
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:34,719
husband

24
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,960
Why are you sleeping here?

25
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,599
My wife is back.

26
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,639
How is Xiao Xiao?

27
00:04:14,759 --> 00:04:15,879
She's fine.

28
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:17,600
It's you.

29
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,120
Why did the jewelry store close?

30
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,360
I can't do it anymore.

31
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:23,879
So I turned it off.

32
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,439
You said you wouldn't open for three years.

33
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,680
Open for three years?

34
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,160
He said it's not expired, and it doesn't last long.

35
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:32,600
What's wrong now?

36
00:04:37,399 --> 00:04:39,360
It's not appropriate. I stopped my losses in time.

37
00:04:41,879 --> 00:04:43,480
Have you thought it through?

38
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:46,120
It's not easy to start a business.

39
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,879
Will not be smooth sailing.

40
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:51,000
Otherwise, let's stick to it.

41
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,120
wife

42
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,279
ready to give and take

43
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,199
Don't fear the past and the future.

44
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,839
I've already decided.

45
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,160
I won't think about it anymore.

46
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:05,160
Look.

47
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,040
I'm fine now.

48
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:09,720
It's good.

49
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,519
That must be good.

50
00:05:11,839 --> 00:05:13,240
How many days have you been lying on the couch?

51
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:18,319
I'm waiting for you.

52
00:05:20,279 --> 00:05:20,920
By the way, wife,

53
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,160
I have a gift for you.

54
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:25,079
what

55
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:28,399
see

56
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,040
Look.

57
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,079
Bank card

58
00:05:39,879 --> 00:05:41,319
I have money.

59
00:05:41,959 --> 00:05:43,839
The salary of the previous drama has just been paid.

60
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,240
This is not for you.

61
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,639
This is an investment for your studio.

62
00:05:51,639 --> 00:05:53,519
Don't you want to invest in Zhang Jingmei's studio?

63
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:54,399
Let her admire you.

64
00:05:55,279 --> 00:05:56,120
narrow

65
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,079
I trusted her.

66
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,560
And trust her talent, you know?

67
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:06,120
You're right about Zhang Jingmei.

68
00:06:06,879 --> 00:06:09,319
You really appreciate and rely on him.

69
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:10,360
Of course.

70
00:06:11,279 --> 00:06:12,079
My wife.

71
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:15,600
Come on.

72
00:06:15,879 --> 00:06:17,279
You're so plausible.

73
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,000
Zhang Jingmei has a bright future.

74
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,199
You want to take advantage of others.

75
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,279
It's also owned by husband and wife.

76
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:25,279
You don't know anything, you single dog.

77
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:26,920
Shan, your sister.

78
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:33,879
You transferred the jewelry store?

79
00:06:33,879 --> 00:06:35,800
To invest in my studio.

80
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:36,920
Two different matters

81
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:40,720
I invested in you because I believe in you.

82
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,160
Although I can't stay in that shabby jewelry store,

83
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:45,319
But I have a wife.

84
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,399
With my wife's talent,

85
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:48,040
is or isn't

86
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,360
My wife is making a film.

87
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:51,519
It's better than opening a jewelry store.

88
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:53,000
There are too many prospects.

89
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,240
But don't be happy.

90
00:06:56,839 --> 00:06:57,879
The ugly words,

91
00:06:58,879 --> 00:07:01,639
Although this is the common property of husband and wife,

92
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,439
Is there 10% of my shares?

93
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:06,040
I don't want it.

94
00:07:06,839 --> 00:07:07,839
I don't need your investment.

95
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,560
Mrs. Long.

96
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:16,439
You must trust Mr. Long's vision.

97
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,360
Take

98
00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:25,639
Seriously.

99
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,639
You must.

100
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:29,319
Correct!

101
00:07:34,839 --> 00:07:35,680
I've drawn up the contract.

102
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,560
Don't take advantage of me.

103
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:40,000
good

104
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:49,800
Look at the terms.

105
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,120
Just sign it.

106
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,399
Everyone is mine.

107
00:07:55,839 --> 00:07:56,439
What are you afraid of?

108
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:58,839
You're right.

109
00:07:59,839 --> 00:08:01,600
Mr. Zhang,

110
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,120
Wish you good cooperation.

111
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,560
Good cooperation, President Long.

112
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:37,360
Are you finished?

113
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:38,960
There's no egg here.

114
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:41,480
Thank you.

115
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,600
The caption goes so fast.

116
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,480
Don't you see through your eyes?

117
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,600
I'm leaving now.

118
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,480
You're the only one.

119
00:09:02,559 --> 00:09:03,200
I booked the show.

120
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,480
So rich.

121
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:06,919
The bag yard looked at the grass mud horse.

122
00:09:11,559 --> 00:09:12,759
That's it.

123
00:09:31,879 --> 00:09:33,120
You two should be company.

124
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,879
Okay, I'll be there soon.

125
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,720
See you later. Bye.

126
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:50,360
husband

127
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:53,000
I'm going to meet an IP author later.

128
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,000
Let's go together.

129
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:57,360
Next time.

130
00:09:57,919 --> 00:09:58,480
Work hard

131
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:02,399
I want you to stay with me.

132
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,360
I'm at ease with you by my side.

133
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:09,320
I asked Luo Beichen to play basketball today.

134
00:10:09,679 --> 00:10:10,200
I'll be there soon.

135
00:10:12,679 --> 00:10:13,279
Next time,

136
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,360
Alright then.

137
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,399
Come to my studio when you're done.

138
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:17,879
OK

139
00:10:18,519 --> 00:10:19,519
Remember to call me.

140
00:10:56,799 --> 00:10:57,639
Hello, Miss Bai.

141
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,720
I've gone out.

142
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:01,759
Alright.

143
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:02,399
I'll be there soon.

144
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:14,240
Have you picked a good project, President Zhang?

145
00:13:16,519 --> 00:13:17,879
Not yet.

146
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,679
How is it going with Miss Bai?

147
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,360
I haven't seen him for a long time.

148
00:13:25,039 --> 00:13:25,960
Give me face?

149
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,639
Miss Bai has been praising you.

150
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,360
His book is good.

151
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:36,960
But the IP is too big.

152
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:39,559
I'm afraid our studio can't operate.

153
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,080
President Zhang,

154
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,679
Being deliberately humble is annoying.

155
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,320
Have you forgotten what you are?

156
00:13:46,799 --> 00:13:48,080
You're Mrs. Long.

157
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,399
Did you know that Mrs. Long started a business in the circle?

158
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:51,200
Means something?

159
00:13:55,679 --> 00:13:59,039
I still think Long Yi has been acting weird recently.

160
00:13:59,799 --> 00:14:01,120
What happened to Long Yi?

161
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:06,480
He's taken.

162
00:14:07,559 --> 00:14:09,159
How could it be?

163
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:12,480
He closed the jewelry store.

164
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,279
The jewelry store is closed.

165
00:14:16,519 --> 00:14:17,320
Just turn it off.

166
00:14:19,159 --> 00:14:21,279
But he's depressed these days.

167
00:14:21,399 --> 00:14:23,000
She hasn't gone out for days.

168
00:14:23,879 --> 00:14:25,360
He used to be different.

169
00:14:28,759 --> 00:14:29,720
You've been watching it all day.

170
00:14:29,919 --> 00:14:31,480
He didn't send me any messages.

171
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,200
And didn't answer the phone.

172
00:14:35,679 --> 00:14:38,799
For Long Yi, a jewelry store

173

It's nothing.

174
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,000
Are you too sensitive?

175
00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:46,240
You've been married for a long time.

176

No way

177
00:14:49,399 --> 00:14:50,559
I still have to go back.

178
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,120
My little sister.

179
00:14:53,399 --> 00:14:54,320

I'm Zhang Jingmei.

189
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:23,919
Who are you?

00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:26,480
I'm a screenwriter.

191
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:28,240
Look at my script.

192
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:29,360
My story is super amazing.

193
00:15:29,799 --> 00:15:30,519
Really? Take a look.

00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:35,200
to wait a moment

198

Don't you know her?

00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,600
I don't know her.

205
00:15:51,639 --> 00:15:53,440
In his WeChat Moments, he said he was your little brother.

206
00:15:53,879 --> 00:15:54,759
I'm calling you Sister.

207
00:15:57,159 --> 00:15:57,480
It's not important.

208
00:15:57,679 --> 00:15:58,559
Look at my script.

209
00:15:58,919 --> 00:15:59,639
My world view

210
00:15:59,799 --> 00:16:01,200
Is set in the next 300 years or so.

211
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,879
Sorry about that.

212
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:04,080
I have something urgent.

00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,159

Go back to work.

00:16:11,559 --> 00:16:12,279
I'll be waiting for you here.

219
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:14,240
I don't have time tonight.

220

Okay, I'll

You're busy.

230
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,640
Mingzhe, come here.

President Chen.

232
00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:20,519
The game plan of Long Mei Island.

233
00:17:20,519 --> 00:17:21,599
Haven't you designed it yet?

234
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,599
Mr. Luo handed in the draft two days ago.

235
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:26,440
It's here.

236
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:36,000
Don't you need to report it in person?

237
00:17:36,319 --> 00:17:37,119
You said that

238
00:17:37,759 --> 00:17:38,000
a row

239
00:17:38,279 --> 00:17:39,240
I'll call him.

240
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:16,720
husband

241
00:18:22,759 --> 00:18:23,359
What are you doing?

242
00:18:25,559 --> 00:18:26,160
Paint

243
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:38,640
Is it pretty?

244
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:40,680
good-looking

245
00:18:49,799 --> 00:18:51,400
You haven't eaten anything all day.

246
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:55,599
I'm not hungry.

247
00:18:57,359 --> 00:18:58,359
Why are you back so early today?

248
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:32,559
If you're in a bad mood, you should say it out.

249
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:33,920
Otherwise, it will get bad.

250
00:19:35,279 --> 00:19:37,720
What's wrong?

251
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,759
I know it's my fault.

252
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,599
I always thought you were a T-Rex.

253
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:54,279
But T-Rex is also weak.

254
00:19:54,599 --> 00:19:55,440
And get hurt.

255
00:19:58,079 --> 00:19:58,640
husband

256
00:19:59,119 --> 00:20:00,640
You are the best in my heart.

257
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:02,480
No matter what happens,

258
00:20:02,839 --> 00:20:04,119
I will always be there for you.

259
00:20:22,359 --> 00:20:24,039
Hello, Jia Lin. What's wrong?

260
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:25,880
Something happened at the studio.

261
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:26,680
Hurry back.

262
00:20:27,079 --> 00:20:27,519
Hurry up.

263
00:20:27,599 --> 00:20:28,519
What happened?

264
00:20:29,319 --> 00:20:29,599
feed

265
00:20:29,759 --> 00:20:30,200
What's up

266
00:20:31,079 --> 00:20:32,799
Jia Lin said something happened at the studio.

267
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:34,160
What about the fifth item?

268
00:20:34,359 --> 00:20:36,359
Is the identification of the staff involved in the event.

269
00:20:38,079 --> 00:20:38,799
This is an emergency plan.

270
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:39,559
Including rainy days.

271
00:20:39,559 --> 00:20:40,559
And the power problem.

272
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:41,519
And unpredictable.

273
00:20:42,079 --> 00:20:43,359
Okay, that's all for today.

274
00:20:43,559 --> 00:20:44,240
Thank you for watching.

275
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,200
Mingzhe, go back to work.

276
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:56,160
President Chen.

277
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,400
Nothing else. I have to go now.

278
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:58,279
to wait a moment

279
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:02,359
Mr. Luo,

280
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:04,279
we

281
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:09,880
I hope our personal affairs

282
00:21:10,039 --> 00:21:11,519
Don't affect our cooperation.

283
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:15,519
It's not personal.

284
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:18,079
Don't worry.

285
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:19,880
I'll work hard.

286
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:21,160
Good cooperation.

287
00:21:23,599 --> 00:21:25,000
And cooperate happily.

288
00:21:26,319 --> 00:21:26,559
Bye

289
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:39,720
Goodbye, Mr. Luo.

290
00:22:00,599 --> 00:22:01,920
Okay, one by one.

291
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:13,480
President Zhang,

292
00:22:14,039 --> 00:22:15,680
Have you read my script?

293
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:16,839
Is the story super cool?

294
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:22,839
That

295
00:22:24,599 --> 00:22:25,319
I'll wait for you outside.

296
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:29,480
Let's sit over there, okay?
