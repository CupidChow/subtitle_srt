00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:05,640
Take it easy.

172
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:06,220
Look at him.

173
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:06,630
Don't lose anything.

174
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:07,430
Take it easy.

175
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:08,140
Be careful.

176
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:08,630
Take this.

177
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:09,970
-Take this, too. -Take this. Here

178
00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:10,780
it comes.

179
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:20,080
Brother,

180
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:21,680
the film is finished,

181
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,670
The room has been set up.

182
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,270
Have you seen your sister-in-law?

183
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:27,270
Sister-in-law,

184
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:29,540
I think she hasn't seen anyone since this afternoon.

185
00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:32,810
Why is there no one here again?

186
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,440
No one answered the phone.

187
00:08:34,850 --> 00:08:36,070
Long Yi,

188
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:39,100
Long Yi,

189
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:41,850
Where are you?

190
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:45,560
Why hasn't he come back yet?

191
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,890
You're back.

192
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:53,120
What's going on?

193
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,460
No, no, I don't know.

194
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:56,050
Did you get irritated?

195
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:57,450
Sister-in-law,

196
00:08:57,450 --> 00:08:58,630
it's dangerous.

197
00:08:58,630 --> 00:08:59,620
-Step back. -What's wrong, sister-in-law?

198
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,030
-Inside, inside, inside. -Be careful, go

199
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:01,800
inside. Hurry up,

200
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,200
It's so noisy.

201
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:10,920
What are you doing?

202
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:17,010
Your Russian herbal tea is delicious,

203
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:20,220
but it has too much stamina.

204
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:24,540
Silly wife,

205
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,620
that's the liquor of the fighting nation.

206
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:29,280
Just drink.

207
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:38,340
Honey.

208
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,510
You called me "husband",

209
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:50,660
"husband",

210
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:51,940

211
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:56,940
it's so great to be your wife.

212
00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:00,450

I can leave everything else to you,

why are you panicking?

248
00:12:58,610 --> 00:13:00,480
You are legally married.

249
00:13:15,050 --> 00:13:16,540
Gosh,

250
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,990
this is so unique.

We're legally married.

253
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,770
You're still sneaking around when you change your clothes.

254
00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:41,830
Well,

255
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:43,300
when did you

I bought it a long time ago.

Do you like it?

What are you doing?

00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:56,570
What a coincidence.

262
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:58,300
I'll get changed, too.

Let's go together.

267
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:12,230
No way.

268
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:13,600
Zhang Jingmei,

269

Zhang Jingmei,

270
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:19,920
This … This is also my home.

271
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:22,360
Zhang Jingmei,

272
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:25,870
have you swelled up?

273
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:33,330
Madam Long,

274
00:14:33,650 --> 00:14:34,450
are you wearing this?

275
00:14:35,970 --> 00:14:37,310
What's wrong with wearing this?

276
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:38,430
It doesn't look good.

277
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:40,560
I've been looking for it for a long time,

278
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,040
so I'm wearing this.

279
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:45,000
Your clothes are comfortable.

280
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:45,730
Your clothes,

281
00:14:45,730 --> 00:14:47,030
I'm not going to a party.

282
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:50,560
Mine.

283
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:54,580
Stingy.

284
00:14:58,110 --> 00:14:59,440
Miss Jing Mei, please have a meal.

285
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:02,500
Thank you.

286
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:04,180
This is the first time I've prepared breakfast for you.

287
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:05,950
I don't know if it suits your taste.

288
00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:07,440
-Yes, yes. -Try

289
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,280
it first.

290
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:09,170
Call me if you need anything?

291
00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:10,550
Thank you.

292
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,580
It's just breakfast.

293
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:21,040
There's no need to exaggerate.

294
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,540
Breakfast needs balanced nutrition.

295
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:24,770
I didn't say nutrition.

296
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:27,560
Uncle,

297
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:28,440
Our chef?

298
00:15:30,010 --> 00:15:32,870
You have a chef at home?

299
00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:34,840
Is it not to your taste?

300
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:35,590
No,

301
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:39,160
I mean, just the two of us,

302
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:40,620
It's just breakfast.

303
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:41,590
Just a little casual.

304
00:15:41,590 --> 00:15:44,160
You don't need to bother Uncle.

305
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:47,890
Who do you want to trouble?

306
00:15:47,890 --> 00:15:49,020
That's what Uncle Wang does.

307
00:15:49,370 --> 00:15:50,450
Do you want him to lose his job?

308
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:55,600
What if Uncle comes to your house?

309
00:15:57,570 --> 00:15:58,890
And Uncle Li and Uncle Zhao

310
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:08,640
Eat more Honey,

311
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:11,160
I'm done.

312
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:15,930
I want to talk to you about a mysterious wedding address,

313
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:17,370
wedding,

314
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,430
Luo Beichen and Yu Lang chose it

315
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:22,410
ancient castle

316
00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:22,820
What do you think?

317
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:25,560
Hello, bro.

318
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:26,550
I'm back.

319
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:37,880
You have a WeChat message.

320
00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:43,530
(Hello, bro. )

321
00:16:43,830 --> 00:16:44,470
(I'm back. )

322
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:47,000
Who is it?

323
00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:51,810
How beautiful

324
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:52,690
a beautiful woman is.

325
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:55,730
Jealous.

326
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:56,790
No.

327
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:58,980
Don't worry.

328
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:01,840
I'm much more manly than you.

329
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,180
A female man.

330
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:21,540
You still have such an old photo?

331
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:23,380
This is your black history.

332
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:24,360
I have to keep it for the rest of my life.

333
00:17:25,970 --> 00:17:27,310
You still haven't changed

334
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:28,460
your bad-hearted habit.

335
00:17:29,970 --> 00:17:31,450
A woman changes eighteen times before reaching womanhood.

336
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:33,410
You put on your skirt.

337
00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:34,910
I've braids my hair.

338
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:38,000
You look like a girl.

339
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:39,520
What do you mean by "like"?

340
00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:41,460
I'm a girl, okay?

341
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:15,160
One more time.

342
00:18:16,290 --> 00:18:17,160
Childish.

343
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:19,740
Don't go.

344
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:20,960
It's not over yet.

345
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:21,950
I'm sure I can make a comeback

346
00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:23,360
in the next round with someone else.

347
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:24,640
Take me to the hotel.

348
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:25,690
The one on Chunqiu Road,

349
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:28,120
you work on your first day at home,

350
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:29,110
No way.

351
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:31,170
I don't have to take care of the hotel now.

352
00:18:31,170 --> 00:18:33,160
I came back this time for another mission,

353
00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:37,420
so I don't need to

354
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,330
ask more friends

355
00:18:39,330 --> 00:18:40,470
to welcome you.

356
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,490
Aren't you afraid that I'll say yes?

357
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:44,100
No,

358
00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:46,220
you always hate parties.

359
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:47,300
I don't think he's free.

360
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:52,920
But if Grandpa asks about it,

361
00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:55,760
I'll give you a good reception.

362
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,320
What happened? Why are you in such a hurry

363
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:08,700
to manicure with me?

364
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:10,450
Hunian,

365
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:12,450
I asked for leave.

366
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:13,920
If you don't have anything else to do,

367
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:14,670
I'll leave.

368
00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:15,760
Jing Mei

369
00:19:16,130 --> 00:19:17,560
-Mom. -Mom, it's

370
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:18,500
your number.

371
00:19:18,890 --> 00:19:19,420
Okay.

372
00:19:21,730 --> 00:19:22,930
How is my son Hu Bowen?

373
00:19:22,930 --> 00:19:24,090
Is he handsome?

374
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:27,220
Handsome is handsome,

375
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:28,730
but I haven't even met your husband,

376
00:19:28,730 --> 00:19:29,900
I just want to see your son.

377
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:31,320
In this order,

378
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:34,880
Old Hu is such a big director,

379
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:35,800
He's so famous,

380
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,170
why do you need me

381
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,330
to introduce you?

382
00:19:38,330 --> 00:19:40,040
Think of it as trying on a wedding dress with me today.

383
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:40,850
Okay?

384
00:19:40,850 --> 00:19:42,400
What do you mean

385
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,210
by doing manicure is the same as trying on a wedding dress?

386
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:46,540
Where is he?

387
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:50,730
Old Hu said he wouldn't hold the wedding again.

388
00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:52,410
Second marriage is low-key,

389
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,420
just a few people have dinner together,

390
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,130
But if the budget is approved,

391
00:19:56,130 --> 00:19:56,900
I can spend whatever I want.

392
00:20:00,370 --> 00:20:01,250
That is to say,

393
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:02,480
he is still afraid that others will know

394
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,490
about your relationship.

395
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,220
Don't talk about me.

396
00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:07,770
What's wrong with you?

397
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:09,950
You didn't even tell me.

398
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:10,960
We're not friends

399
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:14,010
enough. We haven't done it yet, right?

400
00:20:14,450 --> 00:20:15,620
There's no wedding.

401
00:20:17,390 --> 00:20:19,190
It's not Long Yi's style.

402
00:20:19,650 --> 00:20:21,630
Why is your ring so ordinary?

403
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:23,820
You must be married to Long Yi.

404
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:26,100
Except for that dragon.

405
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:27,520
Can you marry someone else?

406
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:30,570
I don't seem to want to do it.

407
00:20:30,570 --> 00:20:31,520
Like you don't want to get married,

408
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:32,200
Yes,

409
00:20:34,010 --> 00:20:35,160
That's more like it.

410
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,190
How do you feel?

411
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:37,380
Big or not?

412
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,130
What are you talking about?

413
00:20:41,130 --> 00:20:42,800
Is the mansion big?

414
00:20:45,650 --> 00:20:48,370
What does it feel like to marry into a rich family?

415
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,080
I don't think so.

416
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,260
I just feel like

417
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:55,980
I'm not alone all of a sudden.

418
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:58,380
There's someone who can vote for you.

419
00:20:58,730 --> 00:21:00,380
I can advance and retreat with you.

420
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:02,100
After hearing what you said,

421
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,070
how do I feel,

422
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:05,870
It's like a fake marriage.

423
00:21:06,590 --> 00:21:08,520
I didn't ask you to marry my dad.

424
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:10,170
He's old and ugly. And I

425
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,400
… Don't say that. Your

426
00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:27,800
dad doesn't need to wrap it. I'm eating

427
00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:31,640
here. I'm eating a cake and cutting off my beard.

428
00:21:41,790 --> 00:21:43,120
Sorry, Mr. Si Luo,

429
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,490
Miss Chen has bought the cake.

430
00:21:47,310 --> 00:21:48,320
Have you paid for it?

431
00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:52,420
Since I'm not lucky enough

432
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:53,800
to eat such a beautiful cake,

433
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,230
Would you be honored

434
00:21:56,230 --> 00:21:57,890
to pay a bill for this beautiful woman?

435
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:00,030
Put it on my account.

436
00:22:00,030 --> 00:22:00,870
2045,

437
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:03,830
you'd better charge it to my account.

438
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:05,250
At four o'clock in the afternoon,

439
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:06,590
there should be another cake service in your hotel.

440
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:08,590
Please order one for this gentleman,

441
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:10,610
and thank him for his love for this cake

442
00:22:10,890 --> 00:22:11,980
Okay Miss Chen,

443
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:13,980
Take care, Miss Chen.

444
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:21,480
2046,

445
00:22:23,810 --> 00:22:25,280
looks like an expert

446
00:22:31,050 --> 00:22:32,160
Hey, honey,

447
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:34,570
According to my map navigation,

448
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:35,770
there are ten minutes left,

449
00:22:35,770 --> 00:22:36,880
You have the right cast position, right?

450
00:22:37,350 --> 00:22:38,420
The location is right,

451
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:39,920
but you don't have to come if you're fine.

452
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:40,650
Forget it.

453
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:41,570
I have something else to do.

454
00:22:41,570 --> 00:22:42,010
Hello.

455
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:49,200
You make it sound like I'm the only one in the world who has nothing to do.

456
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:52,400
Brother is really free recently.

457
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:58,730
Sister-in-law said it.

458
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:02,210
Brother Hao,

459
00:23:02,210 --> 00:23:02,920
take a look at your movements,

460
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:05,030
Come and grab this position.

461
00:23:05,410 --> 00:23:06,020
Remember,

462
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:07,390
don't hit at a 45-degree angle.

463
00:23:07,390 --> 00:23:09,160
It's easy to hit the stand-in in the face.

464
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:09,530
Okay?

465
00:23:09,530 --> 00:23:10,580
Come on, let's go again.

466
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:12,030
Come on.

467
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:18,640
What is

468
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,680
Meng Hao up to?

469
00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:21,930
Step up,

470
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:23,120
fall over your shoulder,

471
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:23,830
Is that okay?

472
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:24,480
Sure,

473
00:23:24,790 --> 00:23:25,280
you have to remember,

474
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:26,650
You're doing the moves for Man Fei,

475
00:23:26,910 --> 00:23:27,990
but you can't show your face all the way, okay?

476
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:29,020
Okay,

477
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:30,310
get ready, brother.

478
00:23:30,310 --> 00:23:31,070
Brother Lai,

479
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:31,810
come on.

480
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:32,870
Turn it on!

481
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:33,780
Put it forward. Put it forward.

482
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:36,170
That one?

483
00:23:36,490 --> 00:23:37,550
Put it here, boss.

484
00:23:37,550 --> 00:23:38,620
Lower your voice.

485
00:23:39,770 --> 00:23:40,460
Are you filming

486
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:41,390
with your voice down?

487
00:23:41,390 --> 00:23:42,180
Okay, okay.

488
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,130
Turn it on!

489
00:23:44,130 --> 00:23:45,540
Get ready.

490
00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:46,830
One, two, three.

491
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:12,680
Are you okay, honey?

492
00:24:13,710 --> 00:24:15,560
Honey, why are you here?

493
00:24:18,450 --> 00:24:18,950
What do you think?

494
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:19,810
It's okay.

495
00:24:19,810 --> 00:24:21,170
I'll go. Who are you?

496
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:25,850
You're killing yourself.

497
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:26,880
Long Yi,

498
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:29,140
Long Yi,

499
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:33,600
What else did you get?

500
00:24:39,290 --> 00:24:41,770
"You are the warm heart of summer night. "

501
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:44,580
You are the letter of the evening breeze.

502
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:48,290
♪ The air is so sweet. ♪

503
00:24:50,350 --> 00:24:52,900
I want to go on an adventure together.

504
00:24:53,210 --> 00:24:55,500
♪ Let's see the world together.

505
00:24:56,020 --> 00:24:59,630
♪ The night sky has become very special.

506
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:03,600
♪ It's so special that the sky is flickering. ♪ I can't even reach

507
00:25:03,990 --> 00:25:06,380
you.
