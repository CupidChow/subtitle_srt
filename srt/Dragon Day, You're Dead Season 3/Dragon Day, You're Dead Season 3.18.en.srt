1
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,199
How's Luo Beichen?

2
00:02:23,199 --> 00:02:23,639
She's down.

3
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,120
But he didn't say anything.

4
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:27,319
I asked Brother Qi to take him around in a sightseeing car.

5
00:02:33,919 --> 00:02:34,319
Well done!

6
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:35,439
President Chen.

7
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:36,520
How did you know?

8
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:38,199
He can definitely design Omei Park.

9
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:39,439
Luo Beichen

10
00:02:40,759 --> 00:02:41,560
There are many talents.

11
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:43,639
Is too scarce.

12
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:45,360
To be alone.

13
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:58,840
Brother Chen.

14
00:02:59,360 --> 00:02:59,919
Your phone number.

15
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:01,960
Don't answer it.

16
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,479
If someone comes,

17
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:08,319
Just say I'm not here.

18
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:11,400
good

19
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:12,800
Including you.

20
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,120
husband

21
00:03:51,159 --> 00:03:52,759
Did you see my badge?

22
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,360
I put it here.

23
00:03:54,919 --> 00:03:56,039
Why is it gone?

24
00:03:56,919 --> 00:03:57,439
No.

25
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:58,759
When you went out yesterday,

26
00:03:58,879 --> 00:03:59,680
Don't you need to wrap it?

27
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,639
You can't throw it away.

28
00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:12,360
What do you mean?

29
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:14,400
What do you mean?

30
00:04:14,439 --> 00:04:15,159
My

31
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:17,519
Why are you so cheeky?

32
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:19,560
Ash gave it to me.

33
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,120
It's really mine.

34
00:04:22,519 --> 00:04:22,959
Don't believe me.

35
00:04:24,839 --> 00:04:25,240
See that?

36
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:26,759
As much as you want.

37
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:27,879
The Divine Treasure Shopping Service.

38
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:28,600
No

39
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,839
You mixed it all together.

40
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:31,879
I don't know which one is mine.

41
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:34,319
wife

42
00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:36,879
What are you talking about?

43
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:37,519
Pick any one.

44
00:05:01,959 --> 00:05:02,399
Don't panic.

45
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:03,360
And wait and see what happens.

46
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:06,959
big sister

47
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,600
Our merchandise is displayed

48
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:10,120
Are planned according to science.

49
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:10,959
There must be no problem.

50
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,519
Are all fine.

51
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,879
Ask your manager to come here.

52
00:05:17,879 --> 00:05:18,879
The manager again?

53
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,480
Big Sister.

54
00:05:22,519 --> 00:05:24,439
If you have any problem, just tell me.

55
00:05:24,839 --> 00:05:27,040
Our manager is quite busy.

56
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:28,839
Sorry, Ms. Zhen.

57
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:29,839
Sorry to have kept you waiting

58
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:30,920
It's okay.

59
00:05:31,279 --> 00:05:33,680
I happened to look at the goods in your supermarket.

60
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:34,720
Don't worry.

61
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,360
All the items we sent to Long Hao Hotel

62
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,279
Fresh fruits and vegetables.

63
00:05:37,279 --> 00:05:39,199
Are all supplied by the source.

64
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,680
Thank you for trusting us.

65
00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:44,240
I'm relieved.

66
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,480
What about this young man?

67
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,639
I've always been serious and responsible.

68
00:05:48,759 --> 00:05:49,839
How about in the future?

69
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:52,600
Let him contact the supply of Long Hao Hotel.

70
00:05:52,879 --> 00:05:53,360
a row

71
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:53,879
Xiao Zhang.

72
00:05:53,879 --> 00:05:55,000
Hurry up and thank President Zhen.

73
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:57,959
President Zhen.

74
00:05:57,959 --> 00:05:58,879
Get to know each other.

75
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:00,639
Director of Long Hao Hotel.

76
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:01,240
Zhen Meili

77
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:03,920
Hello, hello.

78
00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:05,040
I

79
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,279
My name is Zhang.

80
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:09,199
Xiao Zhang.

81
00:06:09,519 --> 00:06:10,360
Work hard.

82
00:06:10,519 --> 00:06:11,920
You have a bright future.

83
00:06:12,759 --> 00:06:13,240
Thank you.

84
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:14,759
President Zhen, take care.

85
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:15,480
Stay a bit!

86
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:16,959
master

87
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:18,240
I'll line up for you.

88
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:19,160
No need

89
00:06:19,319 --> 00:06:19,920
Today,

90
00:06:20,199 --> 00:06:21,040
Master, please.

91
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:23,160
What guest? Master.

92
00:06:24,439 --> 00:06:25,560
Who is Zhang Deshao?

93
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,120
It's me.

94
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:26,560
Give it to him.

95
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,199
Enjoy it.

96
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:28,160
master

97
00:06:28,839 --> 00:06:29,519
Long Hao Hotel.

98
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:30,240
That's right.

99
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,879
Seafood, Master.

100
00:06:36,439 --> 00:06:36,920
come

101
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,360
Shrimp and abalone

102
00:06:40,439 --> 00:06:40,800
Yes

103
00:06:41,839 --> 00:06:43,240
The scallops are gone.

104
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:43,839
Mr. Zhang,

105
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,399
And improved the food for the disciple.

106
00:06:45,399 --> 00:06:45,920
That's right.

107
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,319
My disciple.

108
00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:49,160
It's time to grow.

109
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,319
A master?

110
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,800
And give him some nutrition.

111
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,439
That's great.

112
00:06:53,959 --> 00:06:55,439
Then you should pay for it every day.

113
00:06:56,519 --> 00:06:57,439
My son-in-law

114
00:06:57,879 --> 00:06:59,839
Gave me a seafood restaurant.

115
00:07:00,759 --> 00:07:02,399
I don't know how the dishes are done.

116
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:04,040
Let my disciple taste it today.

117
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:05,160
light

118
00:07:05,399 --> 00:07:06,800
Try it today.

119
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:07,759
Master, I'll do it.

120
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:09,879
What if it tastes good?

121
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,639
Master, every day,

122
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:12,639
And ask them to give it to you.

123
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,560
Thank you, Master.

124
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:35,639
Zhang Jingmei

125
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:37,319
Why are you smirking?

126
00:07:37,839 --> 00:07:38,639
I didn't.

127
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:39,920
Did I?

128
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:43,360
Are you irritated?

129
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:45,160
You can't even manage facial expressions.

130
00:07:46,439 --> 00:07:47,480
You don't know.

131
00:07:47,959 --> 00:07:49,160
This week,

132
00:07:49,279 --> 00:07:51,439
I played billiards with my father three times.

133
00:07:51,439 --> 00:07:53,399
I played sixteen games of chess with my grandfather.

134
00:07:53,399 --> 00:07:54,959
I drank five teas with Aunt Yang.

135
00:07:54,959 --> 00:07:56,000
And had breakfast three times.

136
00:07:56,920 --> 00:08:00,600
My face is frozen with laughter.

137
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:03,879
You smell so good.

138
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,920
How long has it been since I ate you?

139
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,839
Sounds miserable.

140
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,199
I suddenly feel that it's good to marry Hu Da.

141
00:08:13,519 --> 00:08:14,519
One yard.

142
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,399
Don't brainwash yourself here.

143
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,600
When a woman falls in love,

144
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,319
IQ is negative.

145
00:08:23,439 --> 00:08:24,759
It's better to be single.

146
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:26,680
No way

147
00:08:28,399 --> 00:08:29,720
I want to escape this life.

148
00:08:30,439 --> 00:08:31,000
I want to work.

149
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:33,720
Only my work can get me out of the pain.

150
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,679
I've never heard of marrying into a rich family.

151
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:36,960
And get rid of the suffering.

152
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,960
Whenever you two have a chance to work,

153
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,159
Don't forget me.

154
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:41,120
No matter what position,

155
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:41,919
As long as I can get into the team,

156
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,679
I can do anything.

157
00:08:52,039 --> 00:08:52,480
Let's go.

158
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,039
Please explain.

159
00:09:05,559 --> 00:09:06,120
sister

160
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:06,879
That

161
00:09:07,679 --> 00:09:08,799
Is my sister beautiful?

162
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,799
Who told you this is useless?

163
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:13,440
Please explain.

164
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:14,720
sister

165
00:09:15,639 --> 00:09:16,879
I'm a worker.

166
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,039
Call your boss out.

167
00:09:33,799 --> 00:09:34,919
You're his boss.

168
00:09:43,559 --> 00:09:44,600
Not really.

169
00:09:45,039 --> 00:09:48,480
I'm doing my brother-in-law a favor.

170
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,519
Brother-in-law is a major shareholder.

171
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,200
I'll show you some skills.

172
00:09:53,639 --> 00:09:54,320
I haven't paid a penny.

173
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,159
wife

174
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,360
Here's the thing.

175
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,799
And Dong Shuai wants to start a business.

176
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,679
As my brother-in-law, I must support him.

177
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:07,200
right or wrong?

178
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:08,480
but

179
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,039
The poster.

180
00:10:11,159 --> 00:10:13,200
I really don't know what happened.

181
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,799
poster

182
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,000
The poster really helped.

183
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:19,960
sister

184
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,799
You don't even know how good the traffic is.

185
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,440
Since the poster was hung in front of the shop,

186
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,519
That's

187
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,559
A sea of people and a city full of people.

188
00:10:30,039 --> 00:10:30,559
Brother-in-law

189
00:10:30,639 --> 00:10:31,159
I

190
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,799
Is there no chance?

191
00:10:36,759 --> 00:10:37,440
Little lady.

192
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,279
Miss Jia Lin.

193
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:45,440
I really know I was wrong.

194
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,879
The dragon belongs to the Love My Love.

195
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:53,639
To be praised.

196
00:10:53,639 --> 00:10:55,799
Zhang Dong Shuai is arbitrary.

197
00:10:55,799 --> 00:10:56,600
Don't let him off lightly.

198
00:11:02,519 --> 00:11:03,120
sister

199
00:11:21,679 --> 00:11:22,399
Xiaoyi,

200
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,000
Who can win this game?

201
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:26,519
grandpa

202
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:28,039
I think you're hanging.

203
00:11:44,039 --> 00:11:46,759
Isn't this a gift for you, Madam Long?

204
00:11:46,759 --> 00:11:47,559
Grandpa is so amazing.

205
00:11:47,559 --> 00:11:48,919
Can't you see this?

206
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,399
Right, Grandpa?

207
00:11:52,679 --> 00:11:53,639
Jingmei.

208
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:56,519
Are you bored at home?

209
00:11:56,519 --> 00:11:57,600
How could it be?

210
00:11:57,799 --> 00:12:00,120
How happy I am playing chess with my grandfather.

211
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,279
yes

212
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:02,240
Don't play anymore.

213
00:12:02,799 --> 00:12:03,879
You always win. It's boring.

214
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,159
Go play.

215
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:06,639
Okay, Grandpa.

216
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:07,759
I'm not playing anymore.

217
00:12:07,919 --> 00:12:09,639
I want to learn more from you.

218
00:12:09,639 --> 00:12:10,279
Yes

219
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,200
Really

220
00:12:11,919 --> 00:12:13,039
Two more rounds.

221
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,399
I'll learn it next time.

222
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:19,799
You've grown up.

223
00:12:21,159 --> 00:12:24,000
I know I'm happy.

224
00:12:29,799 --> 00:12:30,279
Zhang Jingmei

225
00:12:31,679 --> 00:12:33,279
Why are you sneaking around your house?

226
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:34,759
Lower your voice.

227
00:12:34,919 --> 00:12:35,960
If Aunt Yang hears it,

228
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:36,840
We won't be able to get out.

229
00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:39,639
If you can hear it, just listen.

230
00:12:39,879 --> 00:12:40,840
Xiaoyi Jingmei.

231
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:41,679
aunt

232
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:43,039
You're back just in time.

233
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:43,679
Jingmei

234
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,840
Mrs. King made an appointment to go to her rose garden.

235
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:46,720
For afternoon tea.

236
00:12:47,039 --> 00:12:48,120
Go with your aunt.

237
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:52,759
What's wrong?

238
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,039
Caught a cold.

239
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,000
I might have caught a cold last night.

240
00:12:58,639 --> 00:12:59,600
But it's okay.

241
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:00,840
Are we leaving now?

242
00:13:01,159 --> 00:13:02,240
How can we go there?

243
00:13:02,679 --> 00:13:03,679
Have a good rest at home.

244
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,000
Little one.

245
00:13:05,399 --> 00:13:06,960
No. Invite Dr. Li to the house.

246
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:07,879
Show it to Jingmei.

247
00:13:08,559 --> 00:13:09,080
Look at you.

248
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:09,559
No

249
00:13:09,679 --> 00:13:11,039
Why did she catch a cold?

250
00:13:11,879 --> 00:13:12,639
It's not me.

251
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:17,080
I didn't expect that.

252
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,799
To make a cup of hot ginseng tea for Jingmei.

253
00:13:21,639 --> 00:13:22,279
Are you drinking it?

254
00:13:22,759 --> 00:13:23,759
What are you talking about?

255
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:24,960
Go.

256
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,200
What's up

257
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:30,639
Madam

258
00:13:32,159 --> 00:13:35,960
Why don't you move to the bedroom with me?

259
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:36,519
good

260
00:13:36,519 --> 00:13:37,279
That's fine.

261
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:38,000
Have a good rest.

262
00:13:39,039 --> 00:13:40,240
Take care of Jingmei.

263
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,080
I'm going out.

264
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,320
Auntie, take care.

265
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:51,840
Auntie, she's

266
00:14:11,399 --> 00:14:12,480
Why is it so bright?

267
00:14:20,039 --> 00:14:20,440
Brother Chen.

268
00:14:21,919 --> 00:14:22,440
Brother Chen.

269
00:14:24,799 --> 00:14:25,279
Brother Chen.

270
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,480
What?

271
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,159
He's still alive.

272
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:31,639
Brother Chen.

273
00:14:32,679 --> 00:14:33,600
You haven't been home for two days.

274
00:14:34,279 --> 00:14:35,039
I thought

275
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:36,519
What do you think?

276
00:14:37,759 --> 00:14:39,000
No one paid you?

277
00:14:39,399 --> 00:14:40,159
How could I?

278
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,320
Brother Chen is the most reliable.

279
00:14:48,039 --> 00:14:49,039
This woman

280
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,679
There's been no news for several days.

281
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:52,360
It's too much.

282
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:56,960
What's the smell?

283
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:00,759
Brother Chen.

284
00:15:01,679 --> 00:15:03,120
You should go back to take a shower.

285
00:15:07,159 --> 00:15:07,720
Is it useful?

286
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:10,120
You're here.

287
00:15:14,679 --> 00:15:15,600
Let it cool for a while.

288
00:15:18,279 --> 00:15:19,919
Aunt Yang said that

289
00:15:20,159 --> 00:15:21,720
Let me take care of you.

290
00:15:24,879 --> 00:15:25,440
It's ready.

291
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:25,960
I'll get you some soup.

292
00:15:27,919 --> 00:15:29,279
Interesting?

293
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,600
Interesting.

294
00:15:32,679 --> 00:15:34,120
What do you want?

295
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:37,799
Director Zhang,

296
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:39,799
I just want to...

297
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:42,080
To teach me how to act.

298
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:46,000
Alright.

299
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:48,960
Give me a hug first.

300
00:15:51,879 --> 00:15:53,480
If you take the initiative,

301
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,080
I won't stand on ceremony.

302
00:15:56,919 --> 00:15:58,080
I won't stand on ceremony.

303
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,159
Honey,

304
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:04,399
wife

305
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:06,320
In the daytime,

306
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:08,720
How about this?

307
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,720
Stay by yourself.

308
00:16:22,279 --> 00:16:22,720
Zhang Jingmei

309
00:16:23,679 --> 00:16:24,120
Zhang Jingmei

310
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:43,919
President Chen.

311
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,519
What are you doing?

312
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:58,080
A bad cold.

313
00:16:58,279 --> 00:16:59,559
Thank you for three days.

314
00:17:29,359 --> 00:17:30,519
You're good at finding excuses.

315
00:17:35,799 --> 00:17:37,200
Do you really have a cold?

316
00:17:50,359 --> 00:17:50,920
Hello

317
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:52,359
Two cakes.

318
00:17:53,559 --> 00:17:54,720
Sorry, Miss Chen.

319
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:55,519
The cake is sold out.

320
00:17:56,359 --> 00:17:57,119
It's sold out.

321
00:17:58,839 --> 00:17:59,640
Why are you so fast?

322
00:18:22,119 --> 00:18:22,839
Caught a cold.

323
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:25,519
I think you're eating well.

324
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:27,839
There's no taste in your mouth.

325
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:30,319
Don't waste it.

326
00:18:30,319 --> 00:18:30,880
Give it to me.

327
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,160
Don't argue with a patient.

328
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:44,440
You don't know.

329
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,440
During those two hours on the Ferris wheel,

330
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,440
I was so cold.

331
00:18:50,119 --> 00:18:52,000
Our contract will be extended.

332
00:18:52,319 --> 00:18:52,839
it doesn't matter

333
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:54,640
Take care of yourself.

334
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:55,720
Rest first.

335
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:56,960
good

336
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:00,839
It's a pity.

337
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:03,559
Look at your current condition.

338
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:05,079
I don't think there's any problem.

339
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:06,759
I was going to say

340
00:19:06,759 --> 00:19:08,519
To go to Long Mei Island with me?

341
00:19:09,599 --> 00:19:10,240
Long Mei Island.

342
00:19:11,119 --> 00:19:11,640
Forget it.

343
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:13,079
Rest well.

344
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:15,480
I'll ask someone to send some porridge to your room.

345
00:19:15,799 --> 00:19:16,319
Don't.

346
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:17,720
Work matters.

347
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:18,400
I'll go with you.

348
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:19,559
good

349
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:21,240
Get ready.

350
00:19:21,559 --> 00:19:22,240
Tomorrow morning at 9: 30,

351
00:19:22,839 --> 00:19:23,599
I have a meeting.

352
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:24,160
I'm leaving now.

353
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:26,400
Correct!

354
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,119
People who catch a cold can't eat cake.

355
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:36,720
Pack it for me.

356
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:37,160
Thank you

357
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:41,359
A young master

358
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:43,359
Thank you, Aunt Huang.

359
00:19:54,839 --> 00:19:55,359
Aunt Huang.

360
00:19:56,359 --> 00:19:57,680
What are you doing every day?

361
00:19:57,839 --> 00:19:58,839
I've never seen you idle.

362
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,000
All the daily work.

363
00:20:03,079 --> 00:20:04,160
I'm busy now.

364
00:20:05,319 --> 00:20:06,519
Tell Da Mei.

365
00:20:06,599 --> 00:20:07,839
I'll probably take a leave in a couple of days.

366
00:20:19,759 --> 00:20:21,160
I have to brace myself.

367
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:22,880
And make a fuss.

368
00:20:34,079 --> 00:20:35,400
Good director.

369
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:36,559
My name is Zhang Jingmei.

370
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:37,359
I'm 23 years old.

371
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:43,440
You've done a good job.

372
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:45,200
And has good qualifications.

373
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:46,160
but

374
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:47,279
Sorry

375
00:20:47,599 --> 00:20:49,640
Our team is not suitable for you.

376
00:20:50,119 --> 00:20:50,799
Director

377
00:20:50,839 --> 00:20:52,039
Although I have little capital,

378
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,480
But I'm willing to learn.

379
00:20:53,759 --> 00:20:54,160
No, no.

380
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:55,440
You're outstanding.

381
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,160
We are not suitable for you.

382
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:01,559
Our film is small.

383
00:21:02,039 --> 00:21:03,359
And the budget is small.

384
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:04,799
Come to us.

385
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,160
A little bit too hard on you.

386
00:21:06,759 --> 00:21:07,880
I won't.

387
00:21:08,519 --> 00:21:08,960
Sorry

388
00:21:09,519 --> 00:21:10,960
Please go back.

389
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:18,720
Sorry to bother you.

390
00:21:23,799 --> 00:21:24,759
The daughter-in-law of the Long family.

391
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:25,640
Who dares to use it?

392
00:21:26,279 --> 00:21:27,559
The Meng Hao incident last time,

393
00:21:27,839 --> 00:21:29,400
I heard that the crew has been delayed for several days.

394
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:30,880
I didn't even dare to fart.

395
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:32,279
That's right.

396
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:33,400
If she comes,

397
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:34,920
You can't beat or scold me.

398
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:36,039
You have to coax me every day.

399
00:21:36,759 --> 00:21:37,799
But then again,

400
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:40,440
This girl is really talented.

401
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:43,559
It's a pity.

402
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:45,079
Jingmei

403
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:47,640
Sister En Qi,

404
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:48,720
Long time no see

405
00:21:49,599 --> 00:21:50,799
You are also in this group.

406
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:53,519
I'm here to meet the crew today.

407
00:21:53,799 --> 00:21:54,240
What about

408
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,440
Don't care too much.

409
00:21:58,799 --> 00:21:59,279
A word.

410
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:00,319
Forget it, sister.

411
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:01,640
No need.

412
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:03,480
What's wrong?

413
00:22:04,079 --> 00:22:04,799
So negative.

414
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:06,920
sister

415
00:22:07,279 --> 00:22:08,359
I just remembered that

416
00:22:08,359 --> 00:22:09,640
I have something to do.

417
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:10,680
I'll go first.

418
00:22:11,079 --> 00:22:11,559
bye-bye

419
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,000
on

420
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:17,039
Hedy

421
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:18,160
Hurry up.

422
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:21,279
To the left.

423
00:22:23,359 --> 00:22:23,880
Unpack the bag.

424
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:24,599
The bag is gone.

425
00:22:27,559 --> 00:22:28,200
on

426
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:32,400
A, A and A.

427
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:33,319
Hurry up.

428
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:38,720
Up, up.

429
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:40,400
fast

430
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:41,599
It's safe.

431
00:22:42,359 --> 00:22:43,000
Sure.

432
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:44,119
Brother-in-law

433
00:22:44,359 --> 00:22:44,640
He's here.

434
00:22:45,519 --> 00:22:46,480
Find your own place to play.

435
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:47,079
don't mention it

436
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:49,680
don't mention it

437
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:50,319
fast

438
00:22:50,319 --> 00:22:50,880
on

439
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:54,480
go

440
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:58,039
fast

441
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:22,880
That's amazing.

442
00:23:24,119 --> 00:23:24,599
Brother-in-law

443
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:25,839
This is your first time here.

444
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:27,079
The technology is good.

445
00:23:29,519 --> 00:23:30,119
Don't play anymore.

446
00:23:30,119 --> 00:23:30,599
Brother-in-law

447
00:23:30,599 --> 00:23:31,400
There's a league next month.

448
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:31,920
together

449
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:33,079
He's not a professional player.

450
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:33,720
Thank you.

451
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:34,359
You're really good.

452
00:23:34,359 --> 00:23:34,960
Don't bother.

453
00:23:35,079 --> 00:23:35,920
Did you see that just now?

454
00:23:36,079 --> 00:23:36,480
Think about it.

455
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:37,480
There's a bonus.

456
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:50,000
Okay, I got it.

457
00:23:50,319 --> 00:23:51,160
Let's talk about it next time.

458
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,319
The daughter-in-law of the Long family.

459
00:24:20,319 --> 00:24:21,319
Who dares to use it?

460
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:25,119
This girl is really talented.

461
00:24:27,079 --> 00:24:27,920
It's a pity.

462
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:34,400
wife

463
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:35,359
How was the interview?

464
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:36,359
Should I pick you up?

465
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:45,480
I'm still young.

466
00:24:46,079 --> 00:24:46,960
Do your own thing.
