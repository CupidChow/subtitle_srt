1
00:02:17,639 --> 00:02:19,199
This is for Mrs. Long.

2
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:21,080
You must be careful.

3
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:21,680
Okay?

4
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:22,800
Can you do that?

5
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,199
All right.

6
00:02:29,159 --> 00:02:30,919
You know it's a wedding gift.

7
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,680
It's very precious.

8
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,800
Why didn't you answer the phone again?

9
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,240
I spent a lot of money.

10
00:02:47,719 --> 00:02:48,120
director

11
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,319
If we can't figure this out,

12
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:51,919
I can't go on working.

13
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:55,479
Yiyi.

14
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,319
You're the acting assistant director of the crew.

15
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,199
You have the whole team.

16
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:01,840
How much does it cost to waste a day?

17
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,759
I'll pay for the delay.

18
00:03:08,759 --> 00:03:10,080
But if the police come,

19
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,840
There's evidence that I didn't do it.

20
00:03:13,039 --> 00:03:13,800
Then she will pay.

21
00:03:15,159 --> 00:03:16,280
To challenge me.

22
00:03:16,759 --> 00:03:17,560
Zhang Yiyi.

23
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,800
You're an actress and assistant director.

24
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:22,840
It's only a few pounds.

25
00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:24,080
You pay for it.

26
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,280
Who are you to compensate?

27
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:27,759
Mrs. Long.

28
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:32,240
Someone asked you something.

29
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:33,800
Don't you want to answer?

30
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,400
Anita is here.

31
00:03:36,919 --> 00:03:38,000
I asked you to order a wedding dress.

32
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,000
I'm calling you.

33
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:39,800
Why didn't you answer it?

34
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,439
I finally understand the director.

35
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:46,319
Is this an interview with my wife?

36
00:03:47,719 --> 00:03:48,159
director

37
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:50,360
Did my wife cause trouble for the crew?

38
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:52,560
Nothing.

39
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,039
Young Master Long.

40
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,400
Are you kidding me?

41
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:54,840
misunderstanding

42
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:55,360
It's all a misunderstanding.

43
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,000
misunderstanding

44
00:03:56,479 --> 00:03:56,879
That's right.

45
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:57,240
misunderstanding

46
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:00,879
Today,

47
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:03,479
Everyone is not working.

48
00:04:08,759 --> 00:04:09,319
That's great.

49
00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:12,280
Honey, leave.

50
00:04:14,919 --> 00:04:15,319
director

51
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:15,879
Where are you going?

52
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:18,079
Let's go.

53
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:18,680
Go and have a look.

54
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:21,360
Let's go, Miss Meng.

55
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:22,639
Go and have a look.

56
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:23,600
go

57
00:04:33,879 --> 00:04:34,399
Choose.

58
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:40,439
To choose here.

59
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:42,319
Correct!

60
00:04:43,399 --> 00:04:43,959
This is Anita.

61
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:45,839
This is my wife.

62
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,240
Miss Anita insisted on seeing you.

63
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:53,959
These ones here

64
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,199
Are Miss Anita.

65
00:04:55,519 --> 00:04:56,279
I picked it out for you.

66
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,240
Miss Lin,

67
00:05:18,519 --> 00:05:19,519
This necklace

68
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,199
It's not the one you lost.

69
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:25,800
No

70
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:26,519
That's good.

71
00:05:29,839 --> 00:05:32,439
This is for my engagement with my wife.

72
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:40,120
Fierce

73
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:48,279
What about

74
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:51,319
Let's go, honey.

75
00:05:57,639 --> 00:05:58,519
With might redoubled

76
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:00,399
It's limitless.

77
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:04,439
Miss Meng.

78
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:08,519
President Chen.

79
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,279
You still have one and a half days off.

80
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:11,920
Cancel my leave.

81
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,199
It's late now.

82
00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:17,720
Actually, these jobs are not that important.

83
00:06:19,319 --> 00:06:20,199
Get off work early.

84
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:21,600
Correct!

85
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,560
Young Master Jin will return home next week.

86
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,199
Do you have time to see him?

87
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,160
not see

88
00:06:35,839 --> 00:06:37,399
Ask him to arrange it.

89
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,399
to give to charity

90
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,160
Hello, Luo Beichen.

91
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,600
My phone is precious.

92
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,319
Can you save me some snacks?

93
00:06:54,439 --> 00:06:58,000
Who told you to abandon me and run so far?

94
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,240
If you regret it,

95
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,480
Hurry back.

96
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,399
If you're late,

97
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,439
I ran away with someone else.

98
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,160
That's right.

99
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,040
Brother Beichen is so popular.

100
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Brother Yu Lang.

101
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,720
When are you coming back?

102
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,120
We missed you.

103
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,000
Brother Yu Lang.

104
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,279
When are you coming back?

105
00:07:18,279 --> 00:07:20,240
We missed you.

106
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:21,319
roll

107
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,480
It's okay. I'm hanging up.

108
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,360
Something's wrong.

109
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:25,800
If you need help,

110
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:27,240
I

111
00:07:30,519 --> 00:07:31,240
I really hung up.

112
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,040
You don't need me?

113
00:07:37,879 --> 00:07:39,639
It's been a few days.

114
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,120
Let's drink together.

115
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,560
Brother Beichen.

116
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,800
Drink with us.

117
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,399
Are you going to cry, Childe Luo?

118
00:07:54,439 --> 00:07:55,959
You're here.

119
00:07:56,399 --> 00:07:57,480
Do you remember who I am?

120
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:03,680
It's all gone.

121
00:08:04,079 --> 00:08:05,000
I'm his girlfriend.

122
00:08:06,079 --> 00:08:07,720
Girlfriend

123
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,720
What's wrong, ex-boyfriend?

124
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:26,040
You're lovelorn again?

125
00:08:28,279 --> 00:08:29,879
Take revenge.

126
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,360
Can you walk?

127
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:34,799
I can't carry you.

128
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:41,080
Get up.

129
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:43,600
The water should be poured like this.

130
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:45,679
You can't water it too much.

131
00:08:46,039 --> 00:08:47,240
Can't be too little.

132
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,080
Let them dry.

133
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:48,759
Did you hear that?

134
00:08:50,799 --> 00:08:51,799
this

135
00:08:51,799 --> 00:08:54,200
I'm afraid I can't.

136
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,720
How about Madam Long?

137
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:57,919
To look after them every day.

138
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,840
You have opened such a big shop.

139
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,480
Do you have two little grass to raise?

140
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:04,360
You should have confidence in yourself.

141
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:07,840
I have more confidence in Madam Long.

142
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:09,519
I'm telling you,

143
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,279
If you raise them to death,

144
00:09:12,639 --> 00:09:13,679
I'm asking you.

145
00:09:16,039 --> 00:09:16,919
wife

146
00:09:17,159 --> 00:09:19,600
Let's go home.

147
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:22,200
I'm here to patrol the shop.

148
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,039
I'll be home in two minutes.

149
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:27,840
husband

150
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,240
The things in your shop

151
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:31,919
Hundreds of thousands at a time.

152
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,120
I'll only give you two blades of grass.

153
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,480
Isn't it a little inappropriate?

154
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:37,679
take

155
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,639
It's perfect.

156
00:09:40,919 --> 00:09:42,080
It's perfect.

157
00:09:42,919 --> 00:09:44,039
Full of love.

158
00:09:44,039 --> 00:09:45,440
Full of vigour

159
00:09:45,799 --> 00:09:47,000
Thank you so much, wife.

160
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:48,440
Honey, you've been working hard.

161
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,759
I should thank you.

162
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:51,639
No,

163
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,240
Watch the road.

164
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,320
Chen Xuanyi

165
00:09:58,919 --> 00:09:59,759
What Xuan Yi?

166
00:09:59,759 --> 00:10:00,480
Okay, I'll hang up.

167
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,360
I see him. Go.

168
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:02,159
get home

169
00:10:02,759 --> 00:10:03,360
get home

170
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:05,000
Slow down.

171
00:10:06,279 --> 00:10:07,279
Look at you.

172
00:10:08,279 --> 00:10:08,679
Slow down.

173
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:09,799
Luo Beichen.

174
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,080
Ex-girlfriend

175
00:10:28,279 --> 00:10:28,799
elephant

176
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,480
Yu Lang, wait for me.

177
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:31,840
Yu Lang.

178
00:10:33,159 --> 00:10:33,600
Yu Lang.

179
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,480
Why are you running so fast?

180
00:10:40,159 --> 00:10:40,720
Why?

181
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,799
Be careful. I'll tell Zhang Jingmei.

182
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,240
She's my classmate.

183
00:10:45,639 --> 00:10:46,080
I said,

184
00:10:47,399 --> 00:10:48,960
Zhang Jingmei is Long Yi's wife.

185
00:10:49,799 --> 00:10:50,799
She's not my wife.

186
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,440
Why are you always following me?

187
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,320
Who told you to bump into me?

188
00:10:56,759 --> 00:10:57,080
I

189
00:10:57,879 --> 00:10:58,440
What?

190
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:00,600
It's my bad luck.

191
00:11:01,039 --> 00:11:01,519
Let's go.

192
00:11:07,639 --> 00:11:08,159
Lower your voice.

193
00:11:09,559 --> 00:11:10,320
Don't disturb the elephant.

194
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:56,879
Where are my clothes?

195
00:11:56,879 --> 00:11:58,480
What? You want to run again?

196
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:00,519
No

197
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,559
Give me the clothes.

198
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,559
Take it and wash it.

199
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,679
What should I wear?

200
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,240
Think of a way.

201
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,000
You can't wear dirty clothes.

202
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:15,200
I threw up last night.

203
00:12:20,159 --> 00:12:20,799
sorry

204
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,480
I'm sorry I have too many things to do.

205
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:27,360
Which one do you want to talk about first?

206
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:29,919
Linda

207
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,240
When I was in danger,

208
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,159
To save him.

209
00:12:34,159 --> 00:12:34,840
This kindness

210
00:12:35,639 --> 00:12:36,759
And bear it in mind.

211
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:37,759
roll

212
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:44,559
Linda

213
00:12:46,159 --> 00:12:49,159
Last night,

214
00:12:49,759 --> 00:12:50,960
Don't blame me.

215
00:12:51,759 --> 00:12:53,120
I didn't do anything to you.

216
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:55,879
Thank you, Linda.

217
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,240
Who is Chen Xuan Yi?

218
00:13:00,159 --> 00:13:00,720
No one.

219
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:02,879
Who is it?

220
00:13:05,879 --> 00:13:08,120
You called her for a whole night.

221
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,080
Take it easy.

222
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:19,320
Let me know if you need anything.

223
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:19,960
Sister, table three.

224
00:13:20,519 --> 00:13:21,039
I'll do it.

225
00:13:22,679 --> 00:13:23,240
Jingmei

226
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:25,159
Little lady.

227
00:13:25,559 --> 00:13:26,879
What's wrong with Jing Mei?

228
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,360
It's like fighting chicken blood.

229
00:13:30,799 --> 00:13:31,679
Any more? Which table?

230
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,080
What are you doing?

231
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:36,279
The store is so busy.

232
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,039
sit

233
00:13:41,879 --> 00:13:42,480
What are you doing?

234
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:44,759
What happened between you and Long Yi?

235
00:13:45,159 --> 00:13:46,200
Nothing's wrong.

236
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:47,559
Did he bully you?

237
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:50,399
No, don't guess.

238
00:13:50,679 --> 00:13:52,000
What's wrong with your family?

239
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:53,279
wrong

240
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:56,200
If anything happens to your family,

241
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,960
Long Yi will help you solve it.

242
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,200
That's work.

243
00:14:02,279 --> 00:14:03,840
Did someone bully you?

244
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,519
No,

245
00:14:05,919 --> 00:14:07,240
I have nothing to do.

246
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,159
To help you?

247
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,440
If you don't tell me,

248
00:14:12,879 --> 00:14:14,039
I called Su Jialin.

249
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:15,039
Don't.

250
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,200
I'm just a little confused.

251
00:14:23,639 --> 00:14:24,480
vast and indistinct

252
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:28,000
Your love is sweet and you married into a rich man.

253
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,279
Your work will be smooth.

254
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:30,480
What are you confused about?

255
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:36,799
I just don't know who I am.

256
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:40,639
Sister, sister.

257
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:41,519
Have some water.

258
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:42,879
No, no. I'm not drinking water.

259
00:14:42,879 --> 00:14:43,559
Thank you.

260
00:14:43,679 --> 00:14:44,159
don't mention it

261
00:14:44,159 --> 00:14:45,080
You can call me Zhang from now on.

262
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,519
I've been here for a long time.

263
00:14:46,519 --> 00:14:48,039
I've been acting in this group.

264
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:49,440
That Xiao Zhang

265
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,679
Director, they are waiting for me.

266
00:14:50,679 --> 00:14:51,200
I'll go first.

267
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,279
It's okay, sister. Go back to work.

268
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:53,399
I'll be at your service anytime.

269
00:14:53,399 --> 00:14:54,240
My name is Zhang Jingwei.

270
00:14:55,159 --> 00:14:56,080
Zhang Jingmei

271
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:56,759
Zhang Jingwei

272
00:14:56,759 --> 00:14:57,360
Our relatives

273
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,159
you're welcome

274
00:15:02,879 --> 00:15:03,799
Director, I'm here.

275
00:15:04,519 --> 00:15:04,960
to regret leaving

276
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:05,440
Yiyi.

277
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,279
Get a chair for Yi.

278
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:07,639
good

279
00:15:07,639 --> 00:15:08,399
No, no.

280
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:10,159
to regret leaving

281
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:10,759
director

282
00:15:10,879 --> 00:15:12,360
How do you think this scene should be shot?

283
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:13,320
Do you have any idea?

284
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:17,000
The director

285
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,120
The coordinator said

286
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,759
Let me check the actors tomorrow.

287
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:20,840
I'll go first.

288
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:21,919
Okay, you go first.

289
00:15:21,919 --> 00:15:22,440
Yiyi, have a seat.

290
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,039
No need.

291
00:15:23,039 --> 00:15:24,120
Director, go back to work.

292
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:25,519
OK, Yiyi.

293
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:28,600
When you said that,

294
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,799
It seems that everyone treats you well.

295
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,759
They are good to Mrs. Long.

296
00:15:36,159 --> 00:15:37,120
What's the difference?

297
00:15:37,559 --> 00:15:38,720
Aren't you Mrs. Long?

298
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,039
But I'm also Zhang Jingmei.

299
00:15:41,679 --> 00:15:42,600
Zhang Jingmei

300
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:44,759
Are you a little hypocritical?

301
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,159
I didn't.

302
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:51,159
Did I? I didn't.

303
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:54,519
That's you.

304
00:15:55,399 --> 00:15:58,639
You can't accept the title of Mrs. Long.

305
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:04,080
Does Long Yi know?

306
00:16:11,159 --> 00:16:12,720
Hello, welcome.

307
00:16:14,919 --> 00:16:16,039
How much is this one?

308
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,600
This is 150,000 yuan.

309
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,440
Sir, you have a good taste.

310
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,720
These are our top jewelry.

311
00:16:21,159 --> 00:16:22,039
Look at this.

312
00:16:22,039 --> 00:16:23,759
You can have a look at the high-end jewelry here.

313
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:27,039
The price is also expensive.

314
00:16:34,919 --> 00:16:36,399
Hello, welcome.

315
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:40,600
Take a look.

316
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,559
Let me see how much this is.

317
00:16:41,559 --> 00:16:42,399
This is 100,000 yuan.

318
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,159
I'll have a look.

319
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:47,919
If you need it,

320
00:16:47,919 --> 00:16:48,720
I'll take it out for you.

321
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:49,559
Try it on.

322
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:50,679
Thank you

323
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:03,720
Easy, easy.

324
00:17:04,119 --> 00:17:04,720
Slow down.

325
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:06,799
Sister, I was looking for you.

326
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:08,200
I found you a comfortable chair.

327
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,000
I'll bring it to you.

328
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:09,559
No, no.

329
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:10,559
I was running around.

330
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:11,400
You don't need a chair.

331
00:17:11,559 --> 00:17:12,200
Thank you.

332
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:13,000
Don't.

333
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,079
I specially prepared it for you.

334
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:16,079
Xiao Zhang.

335
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:18,400
We are the crew.

336
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:19,279
Attend to each one's own duties

337
00:17:19,279 --> 00:17:20,559
Just mind your own business.

338
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,039
If I need anything,

339
00:17:22,039 --> 00:17:23,000
I'll do it myself.

340
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:24,559
Okay, I'll listen to you.

341
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:25,519
Don't.

342
00:17:25,519 --> 00:17:26,839
We all listen to the director.

343
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:28,400
Okay, I've passed.

344
00:17:29,359 --> 00:17:29,880
director

345
00:17:30,759 --> 00:17:31,599
Yiyi is here.

346
00:17:31,599 --> 00:17:32,119
Yiyi.

347
00:17:32,319 --> 00:17:32,759
Yiyi.

348
00:17:33,799 --> 00:17:34,400
Jingmei.

349
00:17:34,599 --> 00:17:35,440
Are all called Jingmei. In the future,

350
00:17:37,839 --> 00:17:39,160
I apologize to everyone.

351
00:17:39,519 --> 00:17:40,960
My real name is Zhang Jingmei.

352
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:42,759
But working on the crew

353
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,640
I'm Zhang Yiyi, the actress and deputy director.

354
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:46,039
If you are used to it,

355
00:17:46,039 --> 00:17:47,400
Just call me Yiyi.

356
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:48,200
It's Yiyi.

357
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,680
Yiyi.

358
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:52,359
director

359
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,519
I'm married to Long Yi.

360
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:55,519
And Mrs. Long.

361
00:17:55,799 --> 00:17:57,160
But it's nothing.

362
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:58,680
Working on the crew.

363
00:17:58,680 --> 00:17:59,799
We are colleagues.

364
00:18:00,039 --> 00:18:01,279
How did you work before?

365
00:18:01,279 --> 00:18:02,960
It's still the same now.

366
00:18:03,359 --> 00:18:04,240
Don't do that.

367
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,359
Alright, I'll call you Jing Mei.

368
00:18:06,359 --> 00:18:06,920
Sister Jing Mei.

369
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:07,599
Sister Jing Mei.

370
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:08,279
The director

371
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,400
I'll go to work.

372
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,599
Okay, go back to work.

373
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:13,720
Everyone is here.

374
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:14,359
Sister Enqi is here.

375
00:18:14,359 --> 00:18:15,079
Sister En Qi,

376
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:15,599
Sister En Qi,

377
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:16,319
Sister En Qi,

378
00:18:17,359 --> 00:18:18,039
Coach Zhang.

379
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,119
I heard you're the assistant director here.

380
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:22,160
Why are you here?

381
00:18:23,319 --> 00:18:24,920
Director Wang gave me a chance.

382
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,240
Let me be a guest.

383
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:26,880
Sister En Qi,

384
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,119
Are you scolding me?

385
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:29,519
Do you know each other?

386
00:18:30,839 --> 00:18:31,960
Did you bully her?

387
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:32,839
No,

388
00:18:33,559 --> 00:18:34,200
impossible

389
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:35,680
Our team takes good care of the actors.

390
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:36,839
Yes

391
00:18:37,319 --> 00:18:37,920
yes

392
00:18:41,319 --> 00:18:42,039
Zhang Jingmei

393
00:18:42,839 --> 00:18:45,000
You can't be Zhang Yiyi anymore.

394
00:18:53,079 --> 00:18:54,359
This report is wrong.

395
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:56,480
They gave you the data.

396
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:57,799
Why do you still have a problem?

397
00:18:57,799 --> 00:18:58,319
Sorry, sister.

398
00:18:58,319 --> 00:18:59,000
I'll change it again.

399
00:18:59,160 --> 00:18:59,680
Mr. Luo,

400
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:01,759
President Chen is having a meeting.

401
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:02,640
Why don't you wait for her?

402
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:03,519
No need.

403
00:19:05,279 --> 00:19:06,400
This is Long Mei Island Omei Box.

404
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,640
The game design

405
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:08,599
Give it to President Chen.

406
00:19:09,279 --> 00:19:10,519
President Chen will finish the meeting soon.

407
00:19:10,519 --> 00:19:11,279
Why don't you wait for her?

408
00:19:11,319 --> 00:19:11,799
No need.

409
00:19:17,599 --> 00:19:18,559
Let's go to this house.

410
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,000
This place should be good.

411
00:19:20,519 --> 00:19:21,599
Hello, welcome.

412
00:19:21,799 --> 00:19:22,279
Hello

413
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:24,599
This is nice.

414
00:19:24,599 --> 00:19:25,279
It's pretty.

415
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,480
How come

416
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:39,960
And sighs every time.

417
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,400
You're so unlucky.

418
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:45,319
I lost, brother.

419
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:47,799
What did you lose?

420
00:19:50,079 --> 00:19:50,640
love

421
00:19:53,319 --> 00:19:55,240
A girl once told me

422
00:19:55,759 --> 00:19:57,279
I will be punished sooner or later.

423
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:58,720
have to

424
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:00,279
The retribution will come.

425
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,400
Why do I like Chen Xuanyi so much?

426
00:20:05,359 --> 00:20:06,839
Who told you that, Linda?

427
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:09,359
What does it have to do with her?

428
00:20:09,359 --> 00:20:10,519
What are you talking about, Linda?

429
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:16,559
I'm telling you,

430
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,799
Langlang called me that day.

431
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:22,759
He said he was going to see the elephant that night.

432
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:24,599
Do you know who I saw?

433
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:25,759
Who is it?

434
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:27,160
Linda

435
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:30,680
I saw Linda holding you.

436
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:33,599
It's an accident.

437
00:20:34,519 --> 00:20:35,160
That's right.

438
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,319
It's an accident again.

439
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:37,759
It's an accident for you and everyone.

440
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:41,720
I want to make it clear to you.

441
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,119
Chen Xuanyi

442
00:20:43,519 --> 00:20:45,279
Although she looks like a female King Kong,

443
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,720
Actually, he's vulnerable.

444
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:50,519
What you did before,

445
00:20:51,079 --> 00:20:52,440
She never blamed you.

446
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,359
But I'll put the ugly words in front of you.

447
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,720
If you mess with her,

448
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,079
And you're not responsible,

449
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,079
I'll be the first to forgive you.

450
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,920
You know her well and you want to protect her.

451
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:06,799
Why don't you marry her?

452
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,000
According to Uncle Long,

453
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:23,680
He bought the latest remote-controlled car this year.

454
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:25,200
I don't know which one it is.

455
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,279
When I'm 25,

456
00:21:28,279 --> 00:21:29,599
I will marry you.

457
00:21:29,759 --> 00:21:31,720
These things are mine.

458
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:32,960
Brother Long.

459
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,640
You should grow up.

460
00:21:35,599 --> 00:21:36,440
Chen Xuanyi

461
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:37,799
This is the men's room.

462
00:21:37,799 --> 00:21:38,599
Go away.

463
00:21:38,599 --> 00:21:39,720
It's okay. Pee on you.

464
00:21:44,359 --> 00:21:44,799
I won.

465
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:46,039
Chen Xuan Yi, you're amazing.

466
00:21:46,039 --> 00:21:47,000
You're so bold.

467
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
You're too bold.

468
00:21:49,759 --> 00:21:50,559
That's fine.

469
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:51,720
Or I'll marry her.

470
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,680
I only have Jingmei in my heart.

471
00:21:55,279 --> 00:21:56,720
narrow-minded

472
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,039
I really envy you.

473
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:02,240
You and your Chen Xuanyi

474
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,400
You can be innocent since you were young.

475
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:05,960
I envy you.

476
00:22:06,759 --> 00:22:08,279
You don't have to know the female King Kong since you were young.

477
00:22:09,559 --> 00:22:10,920
Hello, welcome.

478
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:14,160
I want to see this.

479
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:15,079
OK

480
00:22:15,079 --> 00:22:15,720
How many are you?

481
00:22:18,039 --> 00:22:19,599
You just came in. You went there.

482
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,920
It's called potential client.

483
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,440
She looked inside, you know?

484
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:24,440
It's two.

485
00:22:26,119 --> 00:22:26,839
Long Yi.

486
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:29,079
Is it interesting to lie to yourself?

487
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:31,200
Who lied to themselves?

488
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,119
Seek truth from facts

489
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:34,200
I know.

490
00:22:35,839 --> 00:22:37,759
It's hard to fail.

491
00:22:39,319 --> 00:22:40,079
Who failed?

492
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:41,519
eldest brother

493
00:22:42,039 --> 00:22:43,240
I haven't failed yet.

494
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:46,200
a row

495
00:22:47,079 --> 00:22:50,440
As long as you insist, you will succeed.

496
00:22:50,839 --> 00:22:51,240
right or wrong?
