1
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:21,120
How dare you laugh?

2
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:23,560
It's all your fault.

3
00:02:24,439 --> 00:02:26,520
To get Ash kidnapped.

4
00:02:26,759 --> 00:02:28,319
Take Jing Mei to the hospital and lie down.

5
00:02:28,639 --> 00:02:30,960
I haven't blamed him for bringing Jingmei and me into trouble.

6
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:33,680
You are stubborn.

7
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,199
No, it's true.

8
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,280
If I hadn't stepped forward,

9
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,319
Uncle and aunt.

10
00:02:38,439 --> 00:02:40,879
You can't blame Xiaoyi for this.

11
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:41,719
That's right.

12
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,120
Fortunately,

13
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,919
Xiaoyi and Jingmei and Ash.

14
00:02:44,919 --> 00:02:46,000
We got along well.

15
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:48,439
Didn't Ash guarantee them all?

16
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,039
Don't scare them.

17
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,039
Anyway,

18
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:52,879
Through this matter,

19
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:54,840
You should teach him a lesson.

20
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,439
of course

21
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,360
Dad, I was wrong.

22
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:02,840
I'm guilty.

23
00:03:03,319 --> 00:03:04,360
It's all my fault.

24
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,919
I'll never do that again.

25
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,719
I must have learned a lot.

26
00:03:09,719 --> 00:03:11,120
If this happens again,

27
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,520
I will definitely go to Switzerland and bring Long Hai back.

28
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,080
What are you talking about?

29
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:17,599
Nothing

30
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:18,879
I am.

31
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,319
I miss my brother.

32
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,199
This kid

33
00:03:23,319 --> 00:03:24,039
That's it.

34
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,319
Young people learn from experience.

35
00:03:26,599 --> 00:03:28,520
You must know what to do in the future.

36
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,000
Right?

37
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,960
We are here to see Jingmei.

38
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,280
Don't let them

39
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,759
I was scared with you.

40
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:35,960
That's right, Dad.

41
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:36,639
Look.

42
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:38,479
Jing Mei is still injured.

43
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:40,199
My arm still hurts.

44
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,000
Grandpa has said that

45
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:43,479
after

46
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,319
No matter how important the business is,

47
00:03:46,719 --> 00:03:47,879
No matter what is important,

48
00:03:48,199 --> 00:03:50,159
Without his precious grandson.

49
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:51,960
Honey, Mrs. Sun is important.

50
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:56,919
I know, aunts and uncles.

51
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:58,199
dad

52
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,199
Then I beg you to

53
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:01,759
to feel relieved

54
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,520
I'll go to Long Mei Island tomorrow.

55
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,039
To prepare for your wedding.

56
00:04:10,759 --> 00:04:12,360
Dad, aunt.

57
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:13,800
Thank you

58
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,720
Do you think he's serious?

59
00:04:17,319 --> 00:04:18,000
Miss Chen,

60
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,360
What cooperation do you want to discuss with Master Kitano?

61
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:23,040
Here's the thing.

62
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,199
We are going to build several cultural industrial parks.

63
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:27,920
I hope the overall style

64
00:04:28,319 --> 00:04:29,920
Can highlight the post-industrial era.

65
00:04:30,199 --> 00:04:32,079
The relationship between cultural inheritance and quality of life

66
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:33,079
Quality of life

67
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:36,639
Speaking of quality of life,

68
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:37,399
That's great.

69
00:04:37,399 --> 00:04:39,160
I know a very good one.

70
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,959
The immersive workshop of Shu Ya.

71
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:42,759
You don't know

72
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,639
It contains natural sea salt.

73
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,600
When I have time,

74
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:50,279
Go on.

75
00:04:51,079 --> 00:04:51,600
Continue

76
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:54,519
We have selected several suitable places.

77
00:04:54,519 --> 00:04:56,560
There's Beijing, Shanghai and Hainan.

78
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,240
Hainan

79
00:05:00,079 --> 00:05:01,120
How about Hainan?

80
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:02,519
I'm telling you,

81
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,680
The best place in Hainan is not the beach.

82
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,040
But Chengqi.

83
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:07,920
It's the land of longevity.

84
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:08,720
I'm telling you, when you are free,

85
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:09,160
Mr.Luo

86
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,399
I think we should

87
00:05:11,399 --> 00:05:13,000
Let's talk when Master Kitano is free.

88
00:05:15,639 --> 00:05:16,399
Don't worry!

89
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,879
Master Kitano, let me talk to you.

90
00:05:21,399 --> 00:05:23,079
Why don't we find a place to eat?

91
00:05:23,079 --> 00:05:23,839
Let's talk while eating.

92
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:26,439
Otherwise, Master Bei Ye and I

93
00:05:26,439 --> 00:05:27,839
I can't explain.

94
00:05:28,439 --> 00:05:30,000
If Master Kitano is really busy,

95
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,240
Or don't have time to see me.

96
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:31,759
You don't want to see me.

97
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:32,439
Then forget it.

98
00:05:32,439 --> 00:05:34,000
We can look forward to our cooperation in the future.

99
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:35,480
How could it be?

100
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,279
How could he not want to see you?

101
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:38,360
Don't be angry.

102
00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:43,279
Tell me the truth.

103
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:46,240
Master Kitano asked me to meet here today.

104
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,000
Did you do this?

105
00:05:50,439 --> 00:05:52,600
What do you mean?

106
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,680
I really hope you can come to the exhibition.

107
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:58,199
So Master Kitano didn't ask me to come.

108
00:05:58,199 --> 00:05:58,600
Right?

109
00:06:03,319 --> 00:06:06,759
Master Kitano is on the 27th.

110
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,120
Really

111
00:06:09,399 --> 00:06:09,879
Really

112
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:11,920
Luo Beichen.

113
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:14,040
If I can't see Master Kitano on the 27th,

114
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,519
I ate the National Customs painting.

115
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:28,000
Hurry up.

116
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,519
It's getting dark.

117
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:30,600
mom

118
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,040
My sister must have everything.

119
00:06:32,279 --> 00:06:33,040
Even if there's something missing,

120
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,000
My brother-in-law is ready.

121
00:06:34,439 --> 00:06:35,680
We don't need to take anything.

122
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,240
You men are careless.

123
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,800
It's troublesome to take it.

124
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,920
When you use it, you will know it's urgent.

125
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,040
Jing Mei is suddenly in the hospital.

126
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,879
How can I be wronged?

127
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:47,399
Let's go.

128
00:06:47,399 --> 00:06:48,480
go

129
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,279
It's too crowded for you to go down.

130
00:06:58,439 --> 00:06:59,920
This is the patient bed.

131
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,959
You can only sleep alone, okay?

132
00:07:03,399 --> 00:07:05,240
Sleep wife.

133
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:07,399
It's still dark, I can't sleep.

134
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,360
Then what do you want to do?

135
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,759
I want you to go down.

136
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,000
Jingmei, Jingmi.

137
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,040
Mom, dad, Jing Mei.

138
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:19,680
Why are you here?

139
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,560
Are you alright?

140
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,360
You scared me to death.

141
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,480
It's okay, mom.

142
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,279
mom

143
00:07:23,399 --> 00:07:24,040
I'm fine.

144
00:07:24,279 --> 00:07:25,199
Look, let me have a look.

145
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:26,759
Brother-in-law, you need everything, right?

146
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:27,480
Dad, I...

147
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,639
What happened to you,

148
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:30,040
Why didn't you tell your parents?

149
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,000
Namely

150
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:31,480
We should

151
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,439
From your brother's phone.

152
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:36,879
It's me. From my phone,

153
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:38,000
When I saw Little Miss's WeChat Moments,

154
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:38,879
It's none of my business.

155
00:07:40,439 --> 00:07:42,360
Mom, dad.

156
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,000
I didn't take care of Jingmei.

157
00:07:45,399 --> 00:07:45,720
sorry

158
00:07:48,399 --> 00:07:48,879
Brother-in-law

159
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:50,439
My sister is used to fighting.

160
00:07:50,439 --> 00:07:51,160
It's real.

161
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:52,120
Shut up!

162
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:52,680
Shut up.

163
00:07:52,759 --> 00:07:53,439
Little one.

164
00:07:53,879 --> 00:07:54,759
Mom said that

165
00:07:55,639 --> 00:07:56,680
How could you take Jingmei?

166
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,319
To such a dangerous place?

167
00:07:58,639 --> 00:07:59,759
yes

168
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:00,480
mom

169
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:01,720
No, it's dangerous.

170
00:08:01,839 --> 00:08:03,439
And I'm fine now.

171
00:08:03,439 --> 00:08:04,199
Look.

172
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,279
Keep a low profile.

173
00:08:06,279 --> 00:08:06,839
Nothing

174
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:09,439
Bowen

175
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,319
Where are you going?

176
00:08:12,399 --> 00:08:13,399
The meal is almost here.

177
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:14,759
Go to your schoolmate's house.

178
00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:16,600
Join an e-sports competition with him.

179
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,680
Come back tomorrow night.

180
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,800
Can you go by yourself?

181
00:08:19,959 --> 00:08:21,800
He came to pick me up with his father.

182
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,480
Take your phone with you.

183
00:08:24,839 --> 00:08:25,759
Remember to eat.

184
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:26,480
OK!

185
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:30,720
I said you don't have to come.

186
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,480
Yes, you're right.

187
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,639
I'll be discharged in a couple of days, okay?

188
00:08:32,639 --> 00:08:33,159
In fact, it's long overdue.

189
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:35,080
My parents said they would meet some time.

190
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,240
I'll make sure that

191
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,399
I'll find you, okay?

192
00:08:37,399 --> 00:08:38,759
It doesn't matter whether we meet or not.

193
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:41,320
The key is whether your days are settled.

194
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:43,960
dad and mom

195
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,000
Everything is up to you.

196
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:47,799
I'm so sorry.

197
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,279
You can't just listen to us.

198
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:50,559
Let's discuss it together.

199
00:08:52,639 --> 00:08:53,279
thus

200
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:53,720
dad and mom

201
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,919
What do you think?

202
00:08:55,919 --> 00:08:56,840
Just say it directly.

203
00:08:57,039 --> 00:08:57,440
Nothing

204
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:01,039
I think the wedding day is the most important.

205
00:09:01,039 --> 00:09:01,519
That's right.

206
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:03,000
You must choose an auspicious day.

207
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,120
The wedding is not luxurious.

208
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,919
You can't lose if you are stronger than him.

209
00:09:05,919 --> 00:09:07,320
The wedding car isn't too big.

210
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:09,039
But it can't be less.

211
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,399
yes

212
00:09:28,159 --> 00:09:28,639
President Chen.

213
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,240
This is the schedule for the 27th.

214
00:09:31,639 --> 00:09:32,159
Please have a look.

215
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,559
To the 28th.

216
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:40,840
But the 28th is your birthday.

217
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,039
I told you to change it.

218
00:09:54,679 --> 00:09:55,720
Less sugar, please.

219
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:57,919
It's full sugar.

220
00:09:58,159 --> 00:09:59,440
If you drink less sugar,

221
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:00,399
You will be thinner.

222
00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:06,120
So handsome.

223
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,879
The God of Men.

224
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:11,320
Three times, sisters.

225
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:13,440
He speaks Chinese so well.

226
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,559
The beach bike is so cool.

227
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:16,960
It's so romantic.

228
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,360
It's perfect.

229
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,039
It's too exaggerated.

230
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:23,840
Enjoy it.

231
00:10:27,679 --> 00:10:28,399
Luo Xiao,

232
00:10:28,679 --> 00:10:30,000
You're so annoying now.

233
00:10:30,159 --> 00:10:31,320
I don't care about your Hu anymore.

234
00:10:32,759 --> 00:10:33,679
That's right, Xiao Xiao.

235
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,679
As long as you can get rid of Hu,

236
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,679
I don't have to compete with you.

237
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,919
What do you think of this milk tea shop?

238
00:10:44,759 --> 00:10:47,080
The topic has changed quickly.

239
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,480
What's wrong with the milk tea shop?

240
00:10:51,559 --> 00:10:53,039
I want to sell this shop.

241
00:10:54,759 --> 00:10:57,080
Sure, Luo Xiao Xiao.

242
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,600
What can I do?

243
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,240
This is Hu's money.

244
00:11:01,559 --> 00:11:01,919
Luo Xiao,

245
00:11:01,919 --> 00:11:04,159
Are you silly to be in a relationship?

246
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,200
You can't tell.

247
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,720
He paid you to play with him.

248
00:11:07,039 --> 00:11:07,840
Really?

249
00:11:08,279 --> 00:11:10,639
Actually, Hu is quite sincere.

250
00:11:11,919 --> 00:11:13,039
What sincerity?

251
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,879
What's his relationship with you now?

252
00:11:14,879 --> 00:11:16,240
You haven't figured it out yet.

253
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:16,639
go

254
00:11:28,279 --> 00:11:30,799
You went to see your best friend again?

255
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,559
What's so good about the milk tea?

256
00:11:34,879 --> 00:11:35,759
You always ignore me.

257
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:41,320
Opening a shop is a big deal.

258
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,720
You must think it through.

259
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,399
Don't be trapped by him.

260
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:45,679
You won't be able to get out by then.

261
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,720
Is it that horrible?

262
00:11:48,559 --> 00:11:50,039
Luo Xiao,

263
00:11:50,159 --> 00:11:52,320
If you really set up a shop with Hu Da's money,

264
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,480
I'll cut ties with you.

265
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:54,440
Namely

266
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:56,080
Not to

267
00:11:56,519 --> 00:11:57,000
this

268
00:12:03,159 --> 00:12:04,120
This is

269
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:07,759
Colstein's people.

270
00:12:08,679 --> 00:12:09,480
What?

271
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,320
Ashe

272
00:12:15,879 --> 00:12:16,759
Ashe

273
00:12:16,759 --> 00:12:17,480
Hello, Jingmei.

274
00:12:19,559 --> 00:12:20,559
He's

275
00:12:20,559 --> 00:12:22,120
Aren't you back in Kolstein?

276
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,279
Because I want to see you.

277
00:12:23,559 --> 00:12:24,200
Then you came again.

278
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,679
How did you know I was here?

279
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,080
Thank you, Jingmei.

280
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,240
At my most dangerous moment,

281
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,679
You don't care about personal safety.

282
00:12:33,399 --> 00:12:34,200
To protect me.

283
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:37,559
Now I want to officially invite you

284
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:39,279
To be the global spokesman of our company.

285
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,480
I don't know if you are willing to

286
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:42,399
Global Endorser

287
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:43,159
Oh, my God.

288
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:45,440
Global endorsements

289
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:46,840
I

290
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:50,279
This is not appropriate.

291
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,600
You can give this condition

292
00:12:51,919 --> 00:12:53,720
As one of my cooperation with the Long family.

293
00:12:54,919 --> 00:12:55,919
I'm very honored.

294
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:57,879
It's also my pleasure.

295
00:12:58,679 --> 00:13:00,200
I'm my global ambassador.

296
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,200
To hold a dance party.

297
00:13:02,039 --> 00:13:03,399
I don't know whether

298
00:13:03,919 --> 00:13:05,639
Invite three people to join us.

299
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,039
Right now?

300
00:13:10,159 --> 00:13:10,399
Yes

301
00:13:10,879 --> 00:13:11,519
Right now.

302
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,000
please

303
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:18,720
Thank you for the gift from Ma Tap.

304
00:13:18,919 --> 00:13:19,519
Thank you.

305
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,679
Our milk tea is definitely delicious.

306
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,279
You can rest assured to buy it.

307

Just order it.

310
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:27,279
Where is she?

311
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:28,240
Our milk tea has many flavors.

312
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,360
Isn't it milk tea?

313
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,320
Jasmine tea.

314
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:32,320
And the milk cover.

315
00:13:32,759 --> 00:13:34,240
And honey milk tea.

316
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,320
Roasted milk tea.

317
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:36,039
Fourth Season Milk Tea

318
00:13:36,039 --> 00:13:37,320
Honey, there's an emergency.

319
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,440
Home late.

320
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,320
I love you so much.

321
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:40,639
Thank you.

322
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:48,440
Birthday gift.

323
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,320
Birthday present.

324
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:52,600
Gifts, gifts and gifts.

325
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:53,679
OK

326
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:55,559
One hundred punches.

327
00:13:56,879 --> 00:13:58,120
My birthday gift to you.

328
00:13:58,759 --> 00:13:59,559
It's all done.

329
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,000
Don't play anymore.

330
00:14:07,399 --> 00:14:08,440
get up

331
00:14:10,519 --> 00:14:11,480
get up

332
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:14,080
Long Yi,

333
00:14:14,919 --> 00:14:16,919
You can't take Zhang Jingmei away

334
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,200
Take it out on your brother.

335
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,759
It's my birthday.

336
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,480
She was looking for my birthday gift. I lost it.

337
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:24,080
Is it appropriate?

338
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Don't panic.

339
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,480
She has a black belt in Taekwondo.

340
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,399
Many men are afraid of her.

341
00:14:35,399 --> 00:14:36,759
Zhang Jingmei

342
00:14:37,799 --> 00:14:39,799
Where are you?

343
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:52,519
Little Jia Lin.

344
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,159
Have you seen Jing Mei?

345
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:55,480
Long Yi.

346
00:14:55,679 --> 00:14:56,600
Why are you so late?

347
00:14:56,679 --> 00:14:57,799
The party is over.

348
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,679
Jingmei left with Ash.

349
00:14:59,679 --> 00:15:00,639
It's for your birthday.

350
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:03,720
To buy me a gift with Ash.

351
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:09,440
No way

352
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,200
I must find Zhang Jingmei.

353
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:13,320
Certain

354
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,120
To find Zhang Jingmei,

355
00:15:21,799 --> 00:15:22,519
what are you doing?

356
00:15:22,679 --> 00:15:23,480
Let go of me!

357
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,960
Dragon, run!

358
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:34,559
You two are together.

359
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,039
One by one.

360
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:45,600
Let go of me!

361
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,480
Is there any law?

362
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:03,600
to get on or into

363
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:13,200
Don't touch me. Stop.

364
00:16:14,559 --> 00:16:15,360
what are you doing?

365
00:16:15,679 --> 00:16:16,440
We are all men.

366
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:17,919
Don't take off my clothes.

367
00:16:20,799 --> 00:16:21,360
Ashe

368
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:22,399
What are you doing, Ash?

369
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:23,320
Are you crazy?

370
00:16:23,639 --> 00:16:24,879
You stole my wife and wanted my life.

371
00:16:25,639 --> 00:16:26,200
Ashe

372
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,120
I'm playing hard with you.

373
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,360
You get out of here.

374
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:34,000
calm

375
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,240
Calm down.

376
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:36,080
Are my own people.

377
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,840
Can I have one last request?

378
00:16:38,679 --> 00:16:39,960
Just one last request.

379
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:41,360
Just one request.

380
00:16:42,559 --> 00:16:43,960
Let me see Zhang Jingmei again.

381
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,000
No, no.

382
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,039
I haven't seen her.

383
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:46,519
I

384
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,320
My last request is

385
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,360
Please be nice to her.

386
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:51,759
She loves to sleep and drink.

387
00:16:51,919 --> 00:16:52,720
You're drunk.

388
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,279
She likes to grind her teeth when she sleeps.

389
00:16:54,519 --> 00:16:55,360
And likes to hit me.

390
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:56,679
You should bear it.

391
00:17:12,039 --> 00:17:13,720
wife

392
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:16,359
All right.

393
00:17:52,759 --> 00:17:53,519
husband

394
00:17:53,799 --> 00:17:54,559
Happy birthday

395
00:17:56,119 --> 00:17:57,279
I'll take care of it.

396
00:17:57,519 --> 00:17:59,000
You're not afraid of scaring your husband.

397
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:02,279
I wanted to give you a surprise.

398
00:18:02,359 --> 00:18:04,680
Who knew that Ashe's bodyguard attacked so hard?

399
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:11,200
Boss

400
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:11,720
Happy birthday

401
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:13,319
Happy birthday

402
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:16,640
Jingmei

403
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,920
You were so cool with your gun.

404
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:22,319
Yu Lang.

405
00:18:22,319 --> 00:18:24,519
The boxing scene was a bit exaggerated.

406
00:18:24,519 --> 00:18:25,759
You worry too much.

407
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,319
Too hasty.

408
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,880
Happy birthday

409
00:18:33,119 --> 00:18:34,000
Thank you.

410
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:34,960
Happy birthday

411
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,119
Don't be so courteous to us.

412
00:18:36,599 --> 00:18:36,799
Make a wish.

413
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:37,680
Come on. Hurry up.

414
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:38,720
Make wishes and wishes.

415
00:18:41,799 --> 00:18:42,839
Cut the cake.

416
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:43,440
good

417
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,680
Happy birthday

418
00:18:44,839 --> 00:18:45,440
Alright.

419
00:19:20,039 --> 00:19:20,880
I'm so stupid.

420
00:19:21,759 --> 00:19:23,359
How could I believe him?

421
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:55,599
Luo Beichen.

422
00:19:55,599 --> 00:19:56,240
Are you interesting?

423
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,839
The timing is perfect.

424
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:05,559
Chen Xuanyi

425
00:20:06,839 --> 00:20:07,559
Happy birthday

426
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:09,599
Luo Beichen.

427
00:20:09,799 --> 00:20:10,839
What the hell are you doing?

428
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:11,960
Where is Master Kitano?

429
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:16,839
Spokesman

430
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,000
The spokesman and the badge?

431
00:20:20,119 --> 00:20:20,880
Of course.

432
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:21,920
This badge

433
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,440
But Ash is sending it to outer space.

434
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:24,599
The same badge.

435
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,160
There are three of them.

436
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:28,960
This stupid thing.

437
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:30,599
You can't recognize it anyway.

438
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:32,400
To fool you.

439
00:20:33,519 --> 00:20:35,079
Don't change the topic.

440
00:20:35,559 --> 00:20:36,559
What are you talking about?

441
00:20:36,839 --> 00:20:38,839
Love to eat love to sleep

442
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:41,799
You sleep at night and you snore.

443
00:20:42,519 --> 00:20:43,440
What do you mean?

444
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:44,359
In your eyes,

445
00:20:44,359 --> 00:20:45,680
You're so worthless.

446
00:20:47,839 --> 00:20:48,480
to speak the truth

447
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,160
I was thinking,

448
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:55,559
I just want to fight one last time.

449
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:03,720
In case

450
00:21:05,279 --> 00:21:06,880
After I told you all this,

451
00:21:07,799 --> 00:21:09,079
Ash abandoned you?

452
00:21:10,839 --> 00:21:11,279
Look.

453
00:21:11,839 --> 00:21:12,720
And started again.

454
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,839
Tell the truth.

455
00:21:14,839 --> 00:21:16,880
And solve the problem with violence.

456
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:19,279
I should have left with Ash.

457
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:21,400
I don't know how much he likes me.

458
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:23,000
cut

459
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,839
Don't you understand, wife?

460
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:29,640
On this planet,

461
00:21:30,319 --> 00:21:30,880
Except for me.

462
00:21:31,599 --> 00:21:33,480
No one can tolerate you.

463
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:36,759
More than three days.

464
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:39,440
cut

465
00:21:45,319 --> 00:21:45,960
please

466
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:58,599
Pretty good

467
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,039
actually

468
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,559
I called you here today.

469
00:22:04,119 --> 00:22:05,319
Besides the official invitation,

470
00:22:06,039 --> 00:22:07,240
I'm selfish.

471
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:08,920
selfishness

472
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,079
Since I first met you,

473
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:14,000
I really like you.

474
00:22:15,519 --> 00:22:17,400
Then you sacrificed yourself to save me.

475
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:18,680
I'm even more sure

476
00:22:19,599 --> 00:22:21,240
You're the one I'm looking for.

477
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,039
Miss Jingmei.

478
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:25,759
Would you like to go to Kolstein with me?

479
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:28,079
Ashe

480
00:22:28,079 --> 00:22:29,279
Stop joking.

481
00:22:29,279 --> 00:22:30,519
I'm married.

482
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:31,559
I know.

483
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:33,200
I don't care.

484
00:22:34,759 --> 00:22:35,319
Come with me.

485
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:38,400
You will be the happiest woman in the world.

486
00:22:42,039 --> 00:22:43,079
Sorry, Ash.

487
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:44,839
To marry Long Yi.

488
00:22:45,079 --> 00:22:46,359
I'm already

489
00:22:46,359 --> 00:22:47,559
The happiest woman in the world.

490
00:22:51,599 --> 00:22:52,759
Is he really that good?

491
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,480
Although he has a lot of shortcomings,

492
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,440
But only by his side.

493
00:23:01,599 --> 00:23:03,880
So that I can feel at ease.

494
00:23:05,119 --> 00:23:06,079
In my life,

495
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,359
You may have to fall in love with this stinking dragon.

496
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:11,480
I see.

497
00:23:12,519 --> 00:23:13,279
but

498
00:23:13,799 --> 00:23:15,440
I still want to do something for you.

499
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:17,359
How about this?

500
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,160
I promised you three things.

501
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:21,680
No matter what,

502
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:23,000
What's your request?

503
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:24,640
I will try my best to finish it.

504
00:23:26,119 --> 00:23:28,200
Did Kohlstein read Jin Yong's novels?

505
00:23:29,359 --> 00:23:30,359
My promise to you

506
00:23:30,359 --> 00:23:31,240
It's permanent.

507
00:23:31,759 --> 00:23:33,400
Feel free to come to Kolstein anytime.

508
00:23:33,759 --> 00:23:34,839
Ashe

509
00:23:39,079 --> 00:23:40,640
Thank you, Ash.

510
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,559
I really appreciate your kindness.

511
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:44,480
Don't be so anxious.

512
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:47,440
You'll need it one day.

513
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:55,519
Then today,

514
00:23:55,519 --> 00:23:57,319
Can you use these wishes together?

515
00:23:59,079 --> 00:23:59,440
Of course

516
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:04,400
The first wish.

517
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,000
I want to borrow the venue from you.

518
00:24:08,759 --> 00:24:09,599
site

519
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:12,759
The second wish.

520
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:14,839
I want to borrow some people from you.

521
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:17,839
The third wish.

522
00:24:17,839 --> 00:24:18,200
Wait

523
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,039
My promise to you is permanent.

524
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,839
Are you sure you want to use it so rashly?

525
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,200
It's not rash at all.

526
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:27,559
It's worth it.

527
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:33,720
Correct!

528
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,359
Your third wish.

529
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:38,079
The fireworks tonight.

530
00:24:38,279 --> 00:24:39,000
Is it pretty?

531
00:24:42,519 --> 00:24:43,079
It's okay.

532
00:24:43,319 --> 00:24:44,000
It's pretty.

533
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:46,920
But it's too hasty.

534
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:50,599
You should not be suitable for business.

535
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:52,880
Do you know the value of the three gold coins?

536
00:24:54,079 --> 00:24:54,960
That's right.

537
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:56,519
If I had known the three coins,

538
00:24:56,519 --> 00:24:58,240
To use it on myself.

539
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,200
You might regret it one day.

540
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,200
I can go back to Colstein and find Ash.

541
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,720
Why are you fighting again?

542
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:07,200
Correct!

543
00:25:07,359 --> 00:25:07,839
Zhang Jingmei

544
00:25:08,599 --> 00:25:09,559
Let me ask you a serious question.

545
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:13,680
In the final analysis

546
00:25:14,319 --> 00:25:15,440
All the gifts today

547
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:17,200
Was prepared by Ash.

548
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:19,079
Where's your gift?

549
00:25:23,079 --> 00:25:25,599
Gift, birthday.

550
00:25:31,079 --> 00:25:33,400
I planned the kidnapping.
