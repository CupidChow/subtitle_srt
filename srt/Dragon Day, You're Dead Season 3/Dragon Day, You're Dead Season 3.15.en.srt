1
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,319
The Star Network Project.

2
00:02:39,479 --> 00:02:40,319
That's right.

3
00:02:40,719 --> 00:02:41,919
The nature of commercial satellites

4
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:43,599
Is a relay station for Earth signals.

5
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:44,599
They are about...

6
00:02:44,599 --> 00:02:45,960
At a height of 36000 kilometers,

7
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,000
In a circular orbit,

8
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,800
Spins at the same speed as the Earth.

9
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:50,360
therefore

10
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:52,759
Just divide them into three groups.

11
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:54,080
Uniform distribution

12
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,360
The distance is 120 degrees.

13
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,199
Can cover the whole world.

14
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,639
You want to use their signals

15
00:02:59,039 --> 00:03:01,240
Let the open air also provide wireless network.

16
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,080
That's right.

17
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,639
The wireless network connection is not restricted.

18
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:05,759
It's free.

19
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:06,319
yes

20
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:10,120
The progress of science is the common welfare of mankind.

21
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:11,800
Ashe

22
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,080
You can have this idea.

23
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,439
It's really not easy.

24
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:18,199
Your understanding is also very good.

25
00:03:18,759 --> 00:03:20,360
You speak well.

26
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,319
Just open your mouth.

27
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:23,479
And ten satellites.

28
00:03:24,039 --> 00:03:25,879
Do you think you can just go to heaven?

29
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:30,199
Dream is not big.

30
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,639
The distance is not far away.

31
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:33,520
As long as you work hard,

32
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:35,000
I will definitely realize

33
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,319
Right, Jingmei?

34
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,080
I believe you can achieve it.

35
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,280
Let's wait and see.

36
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:41,840
Mr. Xiao Long.

37
00:03:42,199 --> 00:03:43,800
I sincerely invite you

38
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,120
Come to Kolstein and play with me.

39
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:45,960
Why?

40
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:46,560
And threatened me.

41
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:47,280
I'm not going.

42
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:54,639
The first one.

43
00:03:54,639 --> 00:03:55,840
Three hours and 58 minutes.

44
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:56,840
In the back,

45
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,240
Hurry up.

46
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,280
Hurry up.

47
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,039
The last scene.

48
00:04:04,039 --> 00:04:04,680
It's done.

49
00:04:06,919 --> 00:04:07,840
How are you? Are you tired?

50
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,159
very good

51
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,319
It's finally over.

52
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:11,639
Thank you, coach.

53
00:04:12,199 --> 00:04:13,280
It's not easy to see you.

54
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:14,240
In the end, you're all fine.

55
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,479
I feel happy.

56
00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:17,319
Thank you, coach.

57
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:20,800
Jialin

58
00:04:21,319 --> 00:04:22,160
My man.

59
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:31,360
Jialin

60
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:32,800
My man.

61
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,600
Hurry up! Hurry!

62
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,399
Are you all right?

63
00:04:37,839 --> 00:04:38,279
What about

64
00:04:38,279 --> 00:04:38,600
Are you all right?

65
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,000
How's it going?

66
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,560
Are you crazy?

67
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:47,639
sister

68
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:48,560
Brother Song asked.

69
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,639
Can you play this?

70
00:04:58,959 --> 00:04:59,519
Ashe

71
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:00,879
I really appreciate you today.

72
00:05:00,879 --> 00:05:01,879
Told us so much.

73
00:05:01,879 --> 00:05:03,040
Colstein's story.

74
00:05:03,279 --> 00:05:04,759
And let us taste

75
00:05:04,759 --> 00:05:06,160
Such a delicious black tea.

76
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:06,560
No

77
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,720
I should thank you.

78
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,120
Spent such a pleasant afternoon with me.

79
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:11,920
That's it.

80
00:05:12,199 --> 00:05:12,800
withdraw

81
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,519
Wait

82
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:19,160
What's in it?

83
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,680
This is the black tea that you drank just now.

84
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:23,120
Put it in the bottle.

85
00:05:23,399 --> 00:05:24,600
Will bring you good luck.

86
00:05:24,879 --> 00:05:25,879
As a welcome gift.

87
00:05:25,879 --> 00:05:26,839
Shall I put it on?

88
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,399
I'll do it myself.

89
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,199
Thank you

90
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:36,199
Thank you

91
00:05:37,839 --> 00:05:38,199

92
00:05:39,079 --> 00:05:39,560
Bye

93
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,000
Worship

94
00:05:47,959 --> 00:05:49,879
Ash speaks Chinese so well.

95
00:05:50,079 --> 00:05:51,040
If you don't look at his face,

96
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,519
I thought he was Chinese.

97
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,879
I really want him to be

98
00:05:54,879 --> 00:05:55,879
A guest role.

99
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,000
I'll do it.

100
00:06:11,399 --> 00:06:12,319
Don't worry!

101
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,319
Be steady like Ash.

102
00:06:16,839 --> 00:06:17,560
I'll do it myself.

103
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:23,759
You're angry.

104
00:06:24,519 --> 00:06:25,199
No,

105
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:26,360
Really?

106
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,519
Do I look angry?

107
00:06:31,319 --> 00:06:32,160
I'll take a shower.

108
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:46,839
Master Kitano.

109
00:06:58,920 --> 00:06:59,759
Please don't.

110
00:07:00,199 --> 00:07:03,120
Please don't. Please.

111
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:03,839
Brother Chen.

112
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,600
What are you talking about?

113
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,399
No, no.

114
00:07:06,399 --> 00:07:07,439
You are not allowed to register.

115
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,439
That's right.

116
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:09,600
That's right.

117
00:07:09,639 --> 00:07:10,160
yes

118
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:13,480
yes

119
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,399
Master Kitano is mine.

120
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:17,199
what

121
00:07:22,079 --> 00:07:22,800
Luo Beichen.

122
00:07:23,519 --> 00:07:24,519
If you dare to lie to me,

123
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:25,720
You will be dead.

124
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,639
The design of our next work

125
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:44,480
true love

126
00:07:45,639 --> 00:07:46,920
What about

127
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,079
I'm really a genius.

128
00:07:54,959 --> 00:07:55,519
Tonight,

129
00:07:55,839 --> 00:07:56,639
Official news release.

130
00:07:57,319 --> 00:07:58,199
Alright, Brother Chen.

131
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:01,279
You seem to have new emails.

132
00:08:01,399 --> 00:08:01,959
Aren't you going back?

133
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:03,560
What's that?

134
00:08:04,079 --> 00:08:05,319
I'm Master Kitano now.

135
00:08:05,959 --> 00:08:06,959
I have to be mysterious and low-key.

136
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:07,759
Understand?

137
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:09,680
Besides,

138
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,759
I have time difference with Dongcheng District.

139
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,560
West Town and East Town.

140
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:15,959
Do you have jet lag?

141
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,480
Sometimes jet lag is an art.

142
00:08:18,759 --> 00:08:19,560
Learn it well.

143
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,000
hi

144
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Hello, hello.

145
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:33,519
You were introduced by Yu Lang.

146
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:34,720
The tea master.

147
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:35,399
Hello, hello.

148
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:36,440
Call me Xie.

149
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,759
I sell tea.

150
00:08:37,759 --> 00:08:38,399
Is not a great god.

151
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:39,559
And humble you.

152
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,320
I'm pressed for time.

153
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:42,600
I'll be brief with you.

154
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:45,720
I have a cup of this black tea.

155
00:08:45,799 --> 00:08:46,679
Look at the color.

156
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,039
How can I make ten cups?

157
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:50,039
Give me a hand.

158
00:08:50,039 --> 00:08:50,840
Alright.

159
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,600
Get me a can of tea first.

160
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,519
Let me see.

161
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:54,480

162
00:08:57,799 --> 00:08:59,080
Take the small spoon in your right hand.

163
00:08:59,080 --> 00:08:59,679
Give me a spoon.

164
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:00,960
And show me.

165
00:09:01,879 --> 00:09:03,799
One spoon.

166
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,399
The tea needs to be added slowly.

167
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:07,879
Right.

168
00:09:07,879 --> 00:09:09,000
Add water. OK.

169
00:09:10,919 --> 00:09:11,480
Add water.

170
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,279
OK

171
00:09:22,799 --> 00:09:23,399
Thank you.

172
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:24,279
The last one is added.

173
00:09:24,519 --> 00:09:25,480
I need water.

174
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,200
Okay, last drink.

175
00:09:32,759 --> 00:09:33,399
just

176
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:35,960
I'm not telling you now.

177
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,240
The situation is urgent.

178
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:46,679
husband

179
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:47,960
Hurry up and take a shower.

180
00:09:55,399 --> 00:09:56,360
What are you doing?

181
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:57,759
Black Tea

182
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,440
Ten cups of different black tea.

183
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:01,960
wife

184
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:03,840
Can you tell

185
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:06,759
Which one is Colstein's black tea?

186
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,279
Stop it.

187
00:10:08,279 --> 00:10:09,519
Hurry and take a shower.

188
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:10,360
I didn't make a scene.

189
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:13,399
You said it was delicious.

190
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:14,559
Don't you mean

191
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:18,559
Never drank such delicious tea?

192
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:22,919
You made it for me.

193
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,120
Don't thank me.

194
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:27,679
Long Yi.

195
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:35,759
wife

196
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,919
There are only three cups left.

197
00:10:40,799 --> 00:10:42,279
Why don't you drink it tomorrow?

198
00:10:43,039 --> 00:10:44,840
I really can't.

199
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,399
Keep guessing.

200
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:47,480
come

201
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:51,600
Yes

202
00:10:52,039 --> 00:10:53,240
Have you figured it out?

203
00:11:06,039 --> 00:11:06,480
early

204
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:09,759
Does the bar smell so good?

205
00:11:10,039 --> 00:11:11,279
You can't even sleep.

206
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:11,879
It smells good.

207
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:13,759
It smells good.

208
00:11:25,759 --> 00:11:27,600
Drive steadily, okay?

209
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:28,600
The first stop is here.

210
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:29,279
Get out of the car.

211
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,279
There's been a change of plan.

212
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:52,559
Are you going after him?

213
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:56,360
If you lose,

214
00:11:57,399 --> 00:11:58,559
Stay away from Zhang Jingmei.

215
00:11:58,639 --> 00:11:59,960
What if you lose?

216
00:12:03,759 --> 00:12:04,519
It's a guest from afar.

217
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:05,960
I won't take advantage of you.

218
00:12:06,879 --> 00:12:07,360
Let's kick off.

219
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,200
This is my project.

220
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:11,840
Don't be too polite.

221
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:14,799
There they are.

222
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:30,000
You two are childish.

223
00:13:41,399 --> 00:13:42,279
It's boring.

224
00:13:49,879 --> 00:13:50,879
What do you mean?

225
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,519
The most important thing is to be happy.

226
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:03,759
Jialin

227
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:04,679
Hurry up.

228
00:14:04,679 --> 00:14:06,200
I have to pick up the kids.

229
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:08,159
I'm talking about Luo Xiao Xiao.

230
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:09,759
Do you remember to eat or not?

231
00:14:10,039 --> 00:14:11,559
Did Old Hu give you the magic soup?

232
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:13,240
Or are you addicted to looking at her?

233
00:14:14,679 --> 00:14:15,000
Boss

234
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Weigh this for me.

235
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:16,639
Alright.

236
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,559
Hu trusted me.

237
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:19,440
Besides,

238
00:14:19,559 --> 00:14:21,399
A little mother cried

239
00:14:21,639 --> 00:14:22,639
I can still ignore him.

240
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,039
Are you masochistic?

241
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,080
Look at this.

242
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:31,120
What?

243
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:31,960
Your bribe money.

244
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:33,759
Hu's bank card.

245
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,600
His wife Ben

246
00:14:37,159 --> 00:14:38,600
Seriously?

247
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,399
Since when does a wife replace a household register?

248
00:14:42,039 --> 00:14:43,399
Your chicken costs eighty-five yuan and six dollars

249
00:14:43,559 --> 00:14:44,679
Okay, let's take it.

250
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,440
I've thought about it.

251
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:48,600
You're right.

252
00:14:50,039 --> 00:14:52,320
What? The evidence doesn't matter.

253
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:54,799
What matters is that we have a better relationship.

254
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:55,879
Look.

255
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,639
He always knew I wanted to open a shop.

256
00:14:57,759 --> 00:14:59,320
He gave me his bank card.

257
00:14:59,679 --> 00:15:01,159
And told me to use it casually.

258
00:15:02,039 --> 00:15:03,279
After that,

259
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:05,200
Will be on this card.

260
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,840
I advise you not to use

261
00:15:07,399 --> 00:15:08,240
why

262
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:09,279
This is for you.

263
00:15:09,759 --> 00:15:10,320
Thank you

264
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:11,440
go

265
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,960
Go with me to see the medlar and ginseng.

266
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:15,399
When did you become so healthy?

267
00:15:16,919 --> 00:15:17,519
Let's go.

268
00:15:21,159 --> 00:15:22,360
Thank you for your company.

269
00:15:22,559 --> 00:15:23,720
I've been very happy these days.

270
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,080
Especially Jingmei.

271
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,000
Come on. Cheers.

272
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:36,240
Boss

273
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:37,000
Get out of here.

274
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:38,720
go

275
00:15:39,879 --> 00:15:40,559
It's dangerous.

276
00:15:42,559 --> 00:15:42,919
go

277
00:15:45,559 --> 00:15:46,399
Where's Ash?

278
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:46,799
here

279
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:52,879
Ashe

280
00:15:54,919 --> 00:15:55,639
Let's go.

281
00:15:55,639 --> 00:15:56,039
fast

282
00:16:32,799 --> 00:16:33,279
Jingmei

283
00:16:33,399 --> 00:16:33,759
Jingmei

284
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,159
Your rice pudding.

285
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:49,759
It smells really good.

286
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:53,279
uncle

287
00:16:54,559 --> 00:16:55,600
This is nutritional powder.

288
00:16:56,159 --> 00:16:57,279
It can replenish qi and blood.

289
00:16:57,559 --> 00:16:58,600
My girlfriend bought it.

290
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:01,039
You're so young.

291
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:02,799
Look, I've been here for three days.

292
00:17:02,799 --> 00:17:04,200
Your aunt didn't come to see me.

293
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,480
My legs aren't injured.

294
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:13,200
Why do you want me in a wheelchair?

295
00:17:14,599 --> 00:17:15,799
If you continue to be brave,

296
00:17:15,799 --> 00:17:17,680
Believe it or not, I will hold you all the time.

297
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:18,799
Jingmei

298
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:20,720
OK

299
00:17:26,119 --> 00:17:27,039
Long Yi.

300
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:28,480
Jialin

301
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,319
Why are you here?

302
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,119
Jingmei

303
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:32,920
What's wrong with Jingmei?

304
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:37,559
Jing Mei was beaten up.

305
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:44,160
Elder brother

306
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,680
Don't bother.

307
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:46,640
I have a superficial injury.

308
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:47,799
It's really okay.

309
00:17:48,359 --> 00:17:48,920
Jingmei

310
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:50,680
You can't be careless.

311
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:51,880
Although the wound is small,

312
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:53,839
Like floating ice at sea level.

313
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,440
Maybe it's the tip of the iceberg.

314
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:56,880
The trauma in the body

315
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,119
It's probably serious.

316
00:17:58,119 --> 00:17:58,440
come

317
00:17:59,119 --> 00:17:59,720
To replenish qi and blood.

318
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:00,880
No need

319
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,319
My husband has bought me a meal.

320
00:18:02,319 --> 00:18:02,920
Elder brother

321
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:03,279
Yes

322
00:18:04,319 --> 00:18:04,880
It's inconvenient for you.

323
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:05,799
Here, Senior Brother. Feed you.

324
00:18:05,799 --> 00:18:07,359
I really don't need it.

325
00:18:08,039 --> 00:18:08,519
Open mouth

326
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:09,720
Nothing

327
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:10,160
Open your mouth.

328
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,000
No, no.

329
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:11,480
No need, Senior Brother.

330
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:12,279
Yu Qiu.

331
00:18:13,519 --> 00:18:14,279
Jialin

332
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:17,720
Jialin

333
00:18:20,119 --> 00:18:20,960
Zhang Jingmei

334
00:18:21,559 --> 00:18:22,559
husband

335
00:18:24,039 --> 00:18:25,279
Jialin, Jialing.

336
00:18:26,319 --> 00:18:26,880
Jialin

337
00:18:27,319 --> 00:18:27,880
Jialin

338
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:29,160
Jialin

339
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:30,480
Jialin

340
00:18:30,839 --> 00:18:32,079
I thought you were busy.

341
00:18:32,079 --> 00:18:33,079
You're not coming?

342
00:18:33,079 --> 00:18:33,680
You...

343
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,599
Why didn't you call me?

344
00:18:35,599 --> 00:18:37,319
So I can pick you up at the door.

345
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:39,319
uncle

346
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:41,599
It's been four hours.

347
00:18:41,599 --> 00:18:42,480
Old hen soup.

348
00:18:42,599 --> 00:18:44,559
Have a taste.

349
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:48,599
Where is the spoon?

350
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:49,519
to

351
00:18:49,759 --> 00:18:50,480
Thank you

352
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,000
Jialin,

353
00:18:56,319 --> 00:18:57,319
I haven't eaten yet.

354
00:18:58,119 --> 00:18:58,599
It smells good.

355
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:00,079
You're really good at this.

356
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,160
Jia Lin, look.

357
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,200
This chicken can't be eaten.

358
00:19:04,359 --> 00:19:04,799
uncle

359
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:06,519
The chicken and the pail

360
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,079
I will give it to you.

361
00:19:08,079 --> 00:19:09,640
Thank you for praising me these days.

362
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:10,880
This is not appropriate.

363
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:11,599
Nothing

364
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,160
Anyway, I'll never come here again.

365
00:19:13,359 --> 00:19:14,400
As a farewell gift for you.

366
00:19:14,839 --> 00:19:15,440
I'm not coming.

367
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:17,240
Why aren't you here?

368
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:17,960
Not Jia Lin.

369
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,279
It's not my fault, okay?

370
00:19:20,279 --> 00:19:20,880
Jia Lin,

371
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:21,400
girl

372
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:23,920
young man

373
00:19:24,519 --> 00:19:25,640
I have to say something about you.

374
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:26,960
Do you know what went wrong?

375
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:28,920
I

376
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:32,119
What's wrong with me?

377
00:19:32,759 --> 00:19:33,440
What's wrong with him?

378
00:19:35,319 --> 00:19:35,720
he

379
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,160
Who is he?

380
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:37,880
I don't know her.

381
00:19:38,519 --> 00:19:39,119
Jialin

382
00:19:39,759 --> 00:19:40,119
I

383
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,680
I know I'm not perfect.

384
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,079
I know I was wrong.

385
00:19:43,319 --> 00:19:44,640
Just give me a chance, okay?

386
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:45,039
such

387
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,119
What did you say

388
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:47,799
I can do it, okay?

389
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:50,079
Alright.

390
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:52,079
Don't follow me.

391
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:56,680
Jialin, Jiallin.

392
00:20:02,279 --> 00:20:03,839
Why don't you have a drink?

393
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:19,039
It's me.

394
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:21,720
You scared me to death.

395
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,559
I thought Long Yi was back so soon.

396
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:25,559
You're so lively.

397
00:20:25,559 --> 00:20:26,400
I'm relieved.

398
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:30,559
Jialin

399
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,559
There's really nothing between us.

400
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,680
I know you are nothing.

401
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:35,799
He has never

402
00:20:35,799 --> 00:20:37,279
Did anything too much.

403
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:40,079
Does he know what is too much?

404
00:20:42,599 --> 00:20:43,519
Jialin

405
00:20:43,599 --> 00:20:44,319
Don't mention him.

406
00:20:44,599 --> 00:20:45,559
What's wrong with you?

407
00:20:46,039 --> 00:20:47,680
Long Yi said you were beaten up.

408
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,440
But Yinzhen

409
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,559
He's actually just

410
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:51,759
You are being paranoid

411
00:20:52,039 --> 00:20:53,880
He fainted on my set.

412
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:55,920
I came to see him for work.

413
00:20:56,319 --> 00:20:56,839
Really

414
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:58,039
You're fine.

415
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,400
It's okay. I'm going to work.

416
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,960
I'm really just a scratch.

417
00:21:03,319 --> 00:21:04,039
I'm fine.

418
00:21:04,759 --> 00:21:05,319
Don't move.

419
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:06,839
You should take care of yourself.

420
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:09,279
When you're ready,

421
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:10,680
Let's get together with Xiao Xiao.

422
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:14,599
That silly girl is being silly.

423
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:16,319
Because of Hu?

424
00:21:18,079 --> 00:21:18,480
That's enough.

425
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:19,640
Jingmei

426
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:20,559
I'll leave now.

427
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:22,160
How about you and Senior Brother

428
00:21:22,319 --> 00:21:24,359
The central air conditioning is not maintained by me.

429
00:21:25,319 --> 00:21:26,319
Take good care of Jingmei.

430
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:29,720
What central air conditioning?

431
00:21:30,039 --> 00:21:30,880
I'm talking about you.

432
00:21:41,279 --> 00:21:42,359
This is the 15th year.

433
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:43,799
The snow mountains in the national style painting.

434
00:21:44,839 --> 00:21:46,599
In the traditional Chinese painting,

435
00:21:46,759 --> 00:21:47,960
And drew the ethereal snow mountains.

436
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:50,960
In the stone painting,

437
00:21:52,519 --> 00:21:53,440
Using traditional Chinese painting.

438
00:21:53,799 --> 00:21:55,880
The way of blending and dyeing,

439
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,000
Not only the oil painting,

440
00:21:59,599 --> 00:22:00,200
artistic conception

441
00:22:00,599 --> 00:22:01,279
And kept it.

442
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,359
The essence of landscape painting.

443
00:22:05,359 --> 00:22:05,759
Luo Beichen.

444
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:08,119
What are you doing?

445
00:22:10,319 --> 00:22:10,799
Miss Chen,

446
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:11,680
Actually, I'm...

447
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:12,720
Don't tell me you're...

448
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:15,200
You sent me an e-mail pretending to be Master Kitano.

449
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,279
Believe it or not, I will hit you.

450
00:22:19,359 --> 00:22:20,240
That's impossible.

451
00:22:21,519 --> 00:22:24,200
I'm the director of this pavilion.

452
00:22:39,319 --> 00:22:41,119
How many times have I told you?

453
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:42,519
Don't move.

454
00:22:44,039 --> 00:22:45,480
I've already gained weight.

455
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:46,200
I just want to move.

456
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,000
You are fat.

457
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,480
The most important thing is to rest, you know?

458
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:50,319
I will become a pig if I rest.

459
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,640
You sound like a pig.

460
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:53,920
You're the pig.

461
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:54,599
Who are you?

462
00:22:54,599 --> 00:22:55,279
I also like pigs.

463
00:22:55,279 --> 00:22:55,720
You're a pig.

464
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:56,240
I also like pigs.

465
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:56,920
Then you're a pig.

466
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,119
You're a pig.

467
00:22:58,359 --> 00:22:58,759
You're a pig.

468
00:22:58,960 --> 00:22:59,759
You're a pig, you are a pig

469
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:00,359
You're a pig.

470
00:23:00,359 --> 00:23:00,599
Pig pig pig

471
00:23:00,599 --> 00:23:01,200
Who are you?

472
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:01,839
You're a pig.

473
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:03,519
Who are you?

474
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:10,119
Aunty, uncle.

475
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:10,640
Jingmei

476
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:11,519
Are you feeling better?

477
00:23:12,039 --> 00:23:13,079
Thank you, aunt. Much better.

478
00:23:13,079 --> 00:23:14,160
Aunty, dad.

479
00:23:14,519 --> 00:23:15,319
sit

480
00:23:15,319 --> 00:23:15,920
Sit down.

481
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:17,079
well

482
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:20,680
Luo Beichen.

483
00:23:20,839 --> 00:23:22,000
Can I thank you?

484
00:23:22,279 --> 00:23:23,960
I really need to talk to Master Kitano.

485
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:25,359
Can you stop making trouble?

486
00:23:26,119 --> 00:23:27,160
Don't worry.

487
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:29,559
Didn't Master Kitano tell you that

488
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:33,359
Am I his agent in Greater China?

489
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:35,920
You're the agent.

490
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:37,119
Yes?

491
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:38,279
Master didn't tell you.

492
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,240
Don't worry.

493
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,599
Master will definitely tell you.

494
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:43,640
Luo Beichen.

495
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:44,599
Miss Chen,

496
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:53,160
sit

497
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:55,359
Sit down.

498
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:57,279
If you don't sit, you won't believe me.

499
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:02,680
please
