1
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:52,759
Hello, Jia Lin.

2
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,280
How is it, Director Zhang?

3
00:02:54,719 --> 00:02:55,879
Have you decided on the project with Ms. Xu?

4
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:58,919
Three novels and five plays.

5
00:02:59,159 --> 00:03:01,280
I can't finish it in two weeks.

6
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,039
Who told you to read the whole book?

7
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,360
Didn't Miss Xu say

8
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,599
Just read the synopsis?

9
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:07,919
How can we just look at the outline?

10
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,199
These are all

11
00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:10,919
I sincerely sent you.

12
00:03:11,719 --> 00:03:13,120
If I don't finish it,

13
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,639
How to communicate with others?

14
00:03:15,159 --> 00:03:16,319
You're the director.

15
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,599
Don't you have a screenwriter?

16
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:18,759
Ms. Xu found it for you.

17
00:03:18,759 --> 00:03:19,840
Are all first-rank screenwriters.

18
00:03:21,639 --> 00:03:22,879
The screenwriter is amazing.

19
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:25,240
I have to keep up with the rhythm.

20
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:28,319
If I don't figure out the plot,

21
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,080
I'm not at ease.

22
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,039
Don't be too anxious.

23
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,000
Go out for a walk.

24
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,439
Leave the studio.

25
00:03:35,639 --> 00:03:36,599
Don't look at anything today.

26
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,240
Okay, I got it.

27
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,479
Get back to work.

28
00:03:40,599 --> 00:03:41,039
bye-bye

29
00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:53,199
one's master's/teacher's son who is older than oneself

30
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,520
Why are you here?

31
00:03:54,759 --> 00:03:55,400
Jingmei

32
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,400
I'm waiting for Jialin.

33
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:59,000
Jialin is not here today.

34
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:04,840
I'll go back.

35
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,000
one's master's/teacher's son who is older than oneself

36
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:06,759
Sorry, Jingmei.

37
00:04:07,479 --> 00:04:08,240
To avoid it,

38
00:04:08,919 --> 00:04:09,919
I can't take you home.

39
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:11,280
Jia Lin will be unhappy.

40
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,840
I didn't mean that.

41
00:04:14,039 --> 00:04:14,919
I want to say that

42
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,240
If you and Jia Lin go on like this,

43
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:16,920
It's not a problem.

44
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,519
Is there anything I can do to help?

45
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:20,560
No,

46
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,519
Before I asked Jia Lin to watch a movie,

47
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,279
I have to stay away from girls.

48
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:25,360
Especially like you.

49
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,040
Such a beautiful girl.

50
00:04:30,439 --> 00:04:31,360
Understand

51
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:32,319
You're going to watch a movie?

52
00:04:32,319 --> 00:04:32,959
When

53
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:33,959
I can ask her out for you.

54
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:34,639
Really?

55
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:35,240
Really

56
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:36,879
That's great.

57
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:38,920
She and I are looking at

58
00:04:40,399 --> 00:04:41,720
The film I took before

59
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:42,360
It's an alpaca.

60
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,439
In previous lives,

61
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,480
That's right.

62
00:04:44,839 --> 00:04:45,839
Let's see which one.

63
00:04:47,399 --> 00:04:48,000
This, this...

64
00:04:50,199 --> 00:04:51,319
Please.

65
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:53,160
I'll leave now.

66
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,240
Good, Senior Brother.

67
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:55,439
Bye

68
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,199
very small

69
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:11,639
Commander Dong is here.

70
00:05:11,879 --> 00:05:12,680
I'm here today.

71
00:05:13,399 --> 00:05:14,360
I have two words to tell you.

72
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,000
The first sentence.

73
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,759
I'm going to play tonight.

74
00:05:19,399 --> 00:05:20,240
Tonight's flight

75
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,240
Go to the airport later.

76
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,439
For how long?

77
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:27,639
The second sentence.

78
00:05:29,439 --> 00:05:30,959
I'll definitely win this competition.

79
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:32,160
When I win the championship,

80
00:05:32,439 --> 00:05:33,199
I will come back and marry you.

81
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,240
Actually,

82
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:38,800
Wait for me.

83
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,560
He's so handsome.

84
00:05:47,839 --> 00:05:50,160
You're so happy.

85
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,720
Hurry, open it.

86
00:05:54,199 --> 00:05:55,120
Hurry up.

87
00:05:57,279 --> 00:05:57,920
very small

88
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,680
Pack three servings of chicken soup for me.

89
00:06:03,959 --> 00:06:04,879
What's up

90
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,680
Nothing.

91
00:06:07,879 --> 00:06:08,680
Really?

92
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:10,839
What happened?

93
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:11,639
Let me tell you something.

94
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:12,720
Jing Mei, you didn't know.

95
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,759
Jing Mei wants three chicken soup.

96
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:15,040
Pack your things.

97
00:06:15,519 --> 00:06:16,000
good

98
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,959
Okay, Luo Xiao Xiao.

99
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:22,120
To do something shameful.

100
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,040
Tell me the truth.

101
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,399
No.

102
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:27,800
Have you finished the script?

103
00:06:28,839 --> 00:06:30,240
Why did you buy so many chicken soup?

104
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,199
They stay up all night fighting for blood.

105
00:06:32,439 --> 00:06:33,040
Are you playing chicken soup?

106
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:33,600
Can you handle it?

107
00:06:35,879 --> 00:06:37,160
It's for Long Yi.

108
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:38,759
The beauty salon is very busy recently.

109
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:40,199
I didn't have time to eat.

110
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:41,000
To make up for him.

111
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,199
Yes?

112
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,720
To be a good wife and a good mother.

113
00:06:44,959 --> 00:06:46,639
Why are you jealous?

114
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,959
Are you in a relationship?

115
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,319
young man

116
00:07:04,839 --> 00:07:06,560
The mask is pretty good.

117
00:07:07,079 --> 00:07:07,800
How old are you?

118
00:07:09,319 --> 00:07:11,040
Auntie, I'm 25 years old.

119
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:13,360
If you like it,

120
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:14,360
You can come often.

121
00:07:16,079 --> 00:07:17,920
This young man is so patient.

122
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,279
He's a good man.

123
00:07:20,519 --> 00:07:21,600
Have you found someone?

124
00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:24,439
I have it.

125
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,000
So young.

126
00:07:28,439 --> 00:07:29,560
And became a boss.

127
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,160
It has a bright future.

128
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:32,720
What do you belong to?

129
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:36,079
Auntie, I'm a dragon.

130
00:07:37,279 --> 00:07:39,439
My eldest brother's niece

131
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:40,519
And graduated from college.

132
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:41,680
Working in a bank.

133
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,480
Really, aunt?

134
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,240
I have a niece in a foreign company.

135
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,000
I earn a lot a month.

136
00:07:49,279 --> 00:07:51,240
She has a house and a car.

137
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:54,800
Really, aunt?

138
00:07:55,319 --> 00:07:56,199
Actually, aunt,

139
00:07:56,199 --> 00:07:57,600
I'm married.

140
00:07:58,399 --> 00:07:58,959
what

141
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:01,639
How old are you?

142
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:03,639
Girlfriend doesn't count.

143
00:08:05,399 --> 00:08:06,800
You're a good man.

144
00:08:08,439 --> 00:08:09,079
That's right.

145
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:12,639
Honey, business is booming.

146
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,759
Honey, you're here.

147
00:08:18,279 --> 00:08:19,120
Take a rest.

148
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:19,720
It's my turn.

149
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:20,279
Alright.

150
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,040
Give it to me.

151
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,639
Sister, I'm serving you now.

152
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:33,120
It might be a little cold.

153
00:08:36,639 --> 00:08:37,559
How is the feeling

154
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:39,639
It's good.

155
00:08:40,279 --> 00:08:41,039
It's comfortable.

156
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:42,480
The mask is comfortable.

157
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,799
You should come often.

158
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,320
I'll definitely come here more often.

159
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,080
Sure, honey.

Yes, I have.

161
00:08:58,399 --> 00:08:59,879
Brother Qiang, what time are you coming?

162
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,440
Why are you still not here?

163
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,440
I've arrived.

164
00:09:04,159 --> 00:09:04,879
Hurry up.

165
00:09:10,919 --> 00:09:11,519
Sir

166
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:12,799
Would you like to serve now?

167
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,039
Hold on.

168
00:09:16,039 --> 00:09:16,519
OK

170
00:09:44,639 --> 00:09:45,200
Xuan Yi.

171
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:46,919
Are you busy?

172
00:09:47,159 --> 00:09:47,840
sorry

173
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:48,759
I'm busy now.

174
00:09:48,759 --> 00:09:50,039
I'm not eating with you today.

175
00:09:50,039 --> 00:09:51,279
It's my treat.

176
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:52,360
That's me.

177
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:12,080
How are you?

178
00:10:13,759 --> 00:10:14,600
I won't let him come.

179
00:10:14,879 --> 00:10:15,519
He wouldn't.

180
00:10:15,799 --> 00:10:16,679
He insisted on missing you.

181
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,240
His body

182
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,000
How could I take such a long flight?

183
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:21,320
This is...

184
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,519
If I wasn't careful,

185
00:10:22,799 --> 00:10:24,200
In the bathroom on the plane.

186
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:24,960
And fell.

187
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:25,919
And fell.

188
00:10:26,039 --> 00:10:26,639
Yes

189
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:28,600
dad

190
00:10:29,559 --> 00:10:30,200
grandpa

191
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:31,759
Xuan Yi is here.

192
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:33,360
To see you.

193
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,639
I've recovered everything.

194
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:35,879
grandpa

195
00:10:36,559 --> 00:10:37,720
You're disobedient again.

196
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,720
He's fine.

197
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:40,600
But the foot injury

198
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,480
I need to stay in the hospital for observation.

199
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:43,919
You need to be hospitalized?

200
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:45,799
Can't you take care of her at home?

201
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,480
I can't.

202
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:49,000
Uncle

203
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:49,960
How about this?

204
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,200
You've been tired for a whole day.

205
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,360
Go back and rest.

206
00:10:52,559 --> 00:10:54,000
I'll handle the hospitalization procedures for Grandpa.

207
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,000
How about this?

208
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:57,279
Go and handle the formalities.

209
00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:58,480
I'll leave when you come back.

210
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:00,960
Boss

211
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,919
Can this really attract money?

212
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,279
Hello, please have your meal.

213
00:11:05,919 --> 00:11:06,559
Thank you

214
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,120
wife

215
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:14,240
Wonton is here.

216
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:15,759
eat

217
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:16,799
husband

218
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:18,759
You worked so hard for so many days.

219
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,039
That's it?

220
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:22,559
I can treat you better.

221
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:25,240
This is delicious.

222
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,399
Is it so delicious?

223
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:30,200
Delicious. I come here every day.

224
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,399
You know the boss well.

225
00:11:33,799 --> 00:11:34,759
Come on, honey.

226
00:11:34,759 --> 00:11:35,639
husband

227
00:11:37,759 --> 00:11:38,639
You've changed.

228
00:11:45,039 --> 00:11:47,799
I swear to you.

229
00:11:48,879 --> 00:11:51,679
I only love you.

230
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,639
I really...

231
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,879
I only love you, Zhang Jingmei.

232
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,519
Eat it.

233
00:12:06,879 --> 00:12:07,799
Eat it.

234
00:12:15,799 --> 00:12:16,440
grandpa

235
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,559
Eat more apples when you're free.

236
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:19,600
Apple is good for health.

237
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,480
It will help you recover.

238
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:21,559
good

239
00:12:21,559 --> 00:12:22,080
Yes

240
00:12:22,919 --> 00:12:24,879
Anyway, when you're free,

241
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,919
I will come to visit you.

242
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,600
Why are you here?

243
00:12:34,919 --> 00:12:36,159
I'm here to see Grandpa.

244
00:12:36,679 --> 00:12:37,639
Who's your grandfather?

245
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:39,759
What do you think?

246
00:12:41,039 --> 00:12:41,759
Xuan Yi.

247
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,240
Luo is a guest.

248
00:12:43,399 --> 00:12:44,480
What are you talking about?

249
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,080
Where is Uncle?

250
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:49,600
I asked him to go back first.

251
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:50,919
He's working hard.

252
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:52,600
I mean, you...

253
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,240
Why are you so impulsive?

254
00:12:57,039 --> 00:12:58,879
We are a family.

255
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,279
Who is your family?

256
00:13:00,759 --> 00:13:01,279
I

257
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:03,679
Come on, Grandpa.

258
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:05,639
Move up. Slowly.

259
00:13:05,639 --> 00:13:07,320
Alright, alright.

260
00:13:07,799 --> 00:13:08,720
Can I, Grandpa?

261
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,000
It's comfortable like this.

262
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:10,879
Sure.

263
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,879
Do you remember this leg?

264
00:13:12,879 --> 00:13:13,759
You can't push hard.

265
00:13:14,159 --> 00:13:15,200
If you want to lie down again,

266
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:15,919
Call me again.

267
00:13:15,919 --> 00:13:17,039
Alright.

268
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:38,720
What?

269
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,879
Nothing. Give it back to me.

270
00:13:41,159 --> 00:13:42,559
Just throw it away.

271
00:13:42,559 --> 00:13:43,519
other

272
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:51,840
Something's wrong.

273
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:01,159
You're so fast.

274
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,759
An acquaintance committed the crime.

275
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,279
What acquaintance committed the crime?

276
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:10,120
I bought it myself.

277
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,360
Are you lying?

278
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,960
Would you spend money on such a stupid thing?

279
00:14:14,559 --> 00:14:15,679
What are you talking about?

280
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,720
They won it back.

281
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,240
Which one?

282
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:29,120
hate

283
00:14:36,679 --> 00:14:37,440
You're here today.

284
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,159
Why didn't you tell me in advance?

285
00:14:39,799 --> 00:14:41,559
You didn't tell me your grandfather was ill.

286
00:14:41,799 --> 00:14:42,799
Why should I tell you?

287
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:44,000
I can do it alone.

288
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:45,679
Chen Xuanyi

289
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:47,120
You should know that

290
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,440
You have a boyfriend.

291
00:14:49,039 --> 00:14:50,639
No matter what happens in the future,

292
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:51,960
You must inform me immediately.

293
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,559
Can't bear it alone.

294
00:14:54,799 --> 00:14:55,879
Don't answer the phone.

295
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,279
Or disappear.

296
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:58,840
Do you know?

297
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:01,759
Did you hear that?

298
00:15:02,879 --> 00:15:03,600
OK!

299
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:05,679
You pissed me off.

300
00:15:20,799 --> 00:15:22,360
This is BB cream.

301
00:15:22,919 --> 00:15:24,399
I see.

302
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:33,440
Why is it CC frost again?

303
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,440
wife

304
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,639
What is this?

305
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:39,320
What are you doing?

306
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Beauty Center

307
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:44,759
Good boy.

308
00:15:45,679 --> 00:15:47,279
He's not ashamed.

309
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:48,799
sit

310
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,240
I've asked someone to check it.

311
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,240
To be exact,

312
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,080
Is a small store.

313
00:15:57,919 --> 00:16:00,200
Can't reach the size of a beauty salon.

314
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:01,919
The jewelry store is closed.

315
00:16:02,159 --> 00:16:03,360
He opened a beauty salon.

316
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:04,279
Don't say that.

317
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:06,039
At least I'm not losing my temper.

318
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:07,279
Oh that's true!

319
00:16:08,039 --> 00:16:09,320
This young master

320
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:11,159
This day, my God, I'm busy.

321
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:13,600
Old Li.

322
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,240
You mean he opened a jewelry store?

323
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:17,519
It's okay to get us a car full of jewelry.

324
00:16:17,799 --> 00:16:19,120
This beauty salon

325
00:16:19,639 --> 00:16:21,480
If I bring back a car full of masks,

326
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,639
Where should I put it?

327
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,480
You can paste it.

328
00:16:26,759 --> 00:16:27,279
I

329
00:16:27,879 --> 00:16:29,120
Are all high quality goods.

330
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,799
My old face

331
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:32,799
Forget it.

332
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,080
What the hell?

333
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:12,640
Master Kitano.

334
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:14,880
Look at this bottle.

335
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:17,359
It's so obvious that Master Kitano

336
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:18,599
Full of creativity.

337
00:17:21,319 --> 00:17:23,400
Is this the smell of art?

338
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:26,799
It's from buying coffee beans in Brazil.

339
00:17:30,359 --> 00:17:31,079
this

340
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,200
This dog can do that.

341
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:45,160
It's lifelike.

342
00:17:46,599 --> 00:17:47,680
It's a leopard.

343
00:17:49,599 --> 00:17:51,359
This is really a leopard.

344
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,000
It's a misunderstanding.

345
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,039
Young Master Long,

346
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:57,599
You've been waiting for me all morning.

347
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,079
What are you doing here?

348
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:02,440
Master Kitano.

349
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:03,640
It's me.

350
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:09,640
I opened a beauty shop.

351
00:18:10,279 --> 00:18:11,839
I want you to promote it for me.

352
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,200
You know a lot of beautiful women.

353
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,000
Don't talk nonsense.

354
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:16,880
My relationships are simple.

355
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:19,000
I won't tell Chen Xuanyi.

356
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,039
What are you panicking about?

357
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:22,079
The real Master Kitano.

358
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:23,400
I have so many customers.

359
00:18:23,799 --> 00:18:24,599
I'm counting on you.

360
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:26,440
No

361
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,599
Are you really using me as a mascot?

362
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:30,119
No,

363
00:18:30,119 --> 00:18:30,440
Brother

364
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:32,599
Brother, the finished product is ready.

365
00:18:34,039 --> 00:18:34,440
good

366
00:18:39,599 --> 00:18:40,319
Long Yi.

367
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:42,640
That's what I want to deliver.

368
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:43,640
Long Yi.

369
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:46,359
Long Yi.

370
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:48,480
That's what I want to deliver.

371
00:18:49,279 --> 00:18:50,519
That's not a money cat.

372
00:18:58,519 --> 00:18:59,519
Hello, Miss Su.

373
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:01,640
How do you know my surname is Su?

374
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:02,839
Please.

375
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,559
This is for you.

376
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:07,440
Package yard

377
00:19:08,119 --> 00:19:08,640
Yes

378
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,240
To support Yinzhen,

379
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,759
It's really bleeding.

380
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:31,920
Yu Qiu.

381
00:19:34,279 --> 00:19:34,680
Jialin

382
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:36,559
Are you really here?

383
00:19:37,559 --> 00:19:39,119
You've grown up, Yu Hao Qiu.

384
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,920
You learned to cheat me by working with Zhang Jingmei.

385
00:19:41,759 --> 00:19:42,319
I'll find her.

386
00:19:42,319 --> 00:19:42,839
Don't.

387
00:19:43,079 --> 00:19:43,599
Jialin, Jialing.

388
00:19:45,119 --> 00:19:45,720
Listen to me.

389
00:19:46,079 --> 00:19:47,000
You always said that

390
00:19:47,279 --> 00:19:48,759
Did I never do anything for you?

391
00:19:49,279 --> 00:19:49,920
I booked the show.

392
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:53,319
Only for you.

393
00:19:55,839 --> 00:19:56,240
Yu Qiu.

394
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,160
What do you want to do?

395
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:00,160
I want to get you back.

396
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:02,240
Jialin

397
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:04,440
I really know I was wrong.

398
00:20:05,359 --> 00:20:08,160
I won't be a man anymore.

399
00:20:08,599 --> 00:20:09,119
No, no.

400
00:20:10,039 --> 00:20:11,400
I just want to be a warm man for you.

401
00:20:13,759 --> 00:20:14,519
From now on,

402
00:20:14,519 --> 00:20:15,440
What should I do in the future?

403
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:16,880
Only for you.

404
00:20:18,119 --> 00:20:19,119
I only have eyes for you.

405
00:20:20,119 --> 00:20:21,000
I only have you in my heart.

406
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,720
Please forgive me, Jia Lin.

407
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:25,880
Yu Qiu.

408
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:26,359
Don't tell me.

409
00:20:26,359 --> 00:20:28,000
You sent me so many movie tickets.

410
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:28,799
You booked the show.

411
00:20:30,359 --> 00:20:31,240
That's right.

412
00:20:31,839 --> 00:20:32,880
Look at this cinema.

413
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,079
Although it's far away,

414
00:20:34,079 --> 00:20:36,440
But my apology

415
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:37,799
But there's no discount at all.

416
00:20:39,319 --> 00:20:41,119
Yu Hao Qiu, are you crazy?

417
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:42,799
Have you paid off the car loan?

418
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:43,680
Is the mortgage paid off?

419
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:45,039
You have too much money to spend, right?

420
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:48,599
How much is this bag?

421
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:49,960
I didn't expect that

422
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:51,359
I can handle so many shows.

423
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:53,599
I thought you would come.

424
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:55,400
If it weren't for the lack of money,

425
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:56,720
I can't choose here.

426
00:20:57,519 --> 00:20:59,160
I know you don't like

427
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:00,119
A bad theater.

428
00:21:00,319 --> 00:21:01,519
Look at this theater.

429
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:04,160
It's cheap.

430
00:21:05,359 --> 00:21:07,119
Now I know I care about money.

431
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:10,319
Jialin,

432
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,400
What bad film?

433
00:21:17,559 --> 00:21:18,880
Jialin, you laughed.
