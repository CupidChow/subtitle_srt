1
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,120
What's wrong with Zhang Jingmei?

2
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,639
You're not Zhang Yiyi.

3
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,800
You have connections, ability and family.

4
00:02:24,199 --> 00:02:25,080
This is the truth.

5
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:27,479
How many people want to be Zhang Jingmei?

6
00:02:27,479 --> 00:02:28,560
She still can't be

7
00:02:30,039 --> 00:02:31,719
But if I call Zhang Jingmei,

8
00:02:32,199 --> 00:02:33,800
I can't be the assistant director.

9
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,879
Why are you staring at the assistant director?

10
00:02:37,719 --> 00:02:38,759
With your ability,

11
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:39,919
You can do a lot of things

12
00:02:39,919 --> 00:02:41,840
More capable than the assistant director.

13
00:02:42,639 --> 00:02:44,759
But this is my favorite job.

14
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:46,400
If I were the assistant director,

15
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,960
I can learn from the director.

16
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,680
And communicate with the actors.

17
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,039
You can also understand the work of various departments.

18
00:02:53,479 --> 00:02:55,159
How long are you going to study?

19
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,199
I watched your movie.

20
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,360
Than many new directors.

21
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:08,159
But the business response is not very good.

22
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,120
But the film

23
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,560
Is an industrial process.

24
00:03:13,479 --> 00:03:14,879
The art part is finished.

25
00:03:15,319 --> 00:03:17,199
We need the commercial part to promote it.

26
00:03:17,439 --> 00:03:19,080
You need to figure out your position.

27
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:19,800
Coach Zhang.

28
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:26,759
You've arrived at the sightseeing platform on the 10th floor.

29
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:28,159
Why are you...

30
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:30,479
You have to climb back up from the first floor.

31
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,680
You have to believe in yourself.

32
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:34,960
To pursue the dream.

33
00:03:35,439 --> 00:03:37,560
You must believe that you have no limit.

34
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,240
You know what?

35
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Hello, have a look.

36
00:03:48,199 --> 00:03:49,120
No, no.

37
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:51,639
Hello, have a look.

38
00:03:51,639 --> 00:03:52,120
No need.

39
00:03:53,159 --> 00:03:54,000
Hello, sir. Have a look.

40
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:54,479
No, no.

41
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:09,840
wife

42
00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:12,240
Do I have such a sharp head?

43
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,120
What do you think?

44
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,480
You're right.

45
00:04:19,639 --> 00:04:20,160
Let's eat.

46
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:21,279
husband

47
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:24,959
Why is there so few people here?

48
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:26,000
Jewelry store.

49
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,959
It's been three years since we opened.

50
00:04:27,959 --> 00:04:29,600
It's not expired and out of breath.

51
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,000
I'm not pointing at it.

52
00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:33,800
You can take it home and collect it.

53
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:35,160
Or my wife.

54
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,160
I heard what you said.

55
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,439
How do you feel

56
00:04:38,439 --> 00:04:39,519
It's not reliable.

57
00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:41,480
Start a business.

58
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,680
It's mainly about creation.

59
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:44,519
It's better to try.

60
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:45,560
go

61
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:47,160
Also

62
00:04:47,879 --> 00:04:49,199
Can you get the right number?

63
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:49,759
That's right.

64
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:51,160
Look at this number.

65
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,240
Then you can change it.

66
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,120
How many numbers?

67
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,319
No.13 is here.

68
00:04:55,639 --> 00:04:56,040
this

69
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:57,759
It's so cute.

70
00:04:57,879 --> 00:04:59,000
It's so cute.

71
00:04:59,160 --> 00:04:59,839
Can we take it away?

72
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:00,399
Sure.

73
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:01,279
This is for you.

74
00:05:01,279 --> 00:05:01,879
Thank you.

75
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:03,360
It's so cute.

76
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,160
That's right.

77
00:05:04,279 --> 00:05:05,000
How about this?

78
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:05,920
There's a surprise.

79
00:05:06,199 --> 00:05:06,639
Thank you

80
00:05:06,759 --> 00:05:07,319
Thank you.

81
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,360
Hello, can I help you?

82
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:13,759
This shop.

83
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,439
I don't think we know each other.

84
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,360
Whether you know me or not doesn't matter.

85
00:05:18,519 --> 00:05:19,560
It's good that you know my husband.

86
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,560
Is your husband

87
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:23,680
Hu Da.

88
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:27,120
I'm telling you,

89
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,439
When you finish your homework,

90
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,319
Let's play another round.

91
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,560
See how I abuse you.

92
00:05:31,639 --> 00:05:32,759
In my experience,

93
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:33,680
What can you use?

94
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,160
You should use a tank.

95
00:05:35,399 --> 00:05:36,800
So I won't bother you.

96
00:05:37,079 --> 00:05:38,079
Second, I...

97
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:39,759
Start with your shooters.

98
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:40,720
Let's talk about it first.

99
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,600
Come out and let go.

100
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:43,360
You're a leprechaun.

101
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:43,920
What are you doing?

102
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,399
Don't let go. I'll call the police.

103
00:05:45,399 --> 00:05:45,959
Let go.

104
00:05:45,959 --> 00:05:46,600
Little Mum.

105
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:47,800
Let go of me.

106
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:48,319
Little Mum.

107
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:49,560
Stop fighting.

108
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:49,839
Let go of me.

109
00:05:49,839 --> 00:05:50,600
What are you doing?

110
00:05:51,079 --> 00:05:51,639
Hu Bobo

111
00:05:51,639 --> 00:05:52,480
You heartless.

112
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,199
What are you yelling about?

113
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,000
Your friend.

114
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:57,439
My mom

115
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,680
Isn't your mother divorced from Hu Da?

116
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,639
They're not married at all.

117
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:10,360
What's wrong? Disappointed?

118
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,959
And expect him to marry you.

119
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,920
I'm telling you, young lady,

120
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,800
There are many people waiting in line behind me.

121
00:06:16,079 --> 00:06:16,759
Until he dies.

122
00:06:16,759 --> 00:06:17,879
It's not your turn.

123
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:21,439
Since Hu Bowen is here,

124
00:06:21,639 --> 00:06:22,720
I don't have to prove my identity.

125
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,639
I'll take the shop.

126
00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:27,560
Little lady.

127
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,759
Little Mom, little Mum.

128
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:32,680
Bowen

129
00:06:33,279 --> 00:06:34,199
Have you finished your homework?

130
00:06:34,439 --> 00:06:35,040
It's finished.

131
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:36,720
Go back with your mother.

132
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,199
I'm not going with her.

133
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:39,920
She doesn't like me at all.

134
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,279
I'll get in the way.

135
00:06:41,959 --> 00:06:42,480
Little Mum.

136
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,360
My dad has so many girlfriends.

137
00:06:44,959 --> 00:06:46,360
Only you are good to me.

138
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,120
Don't leave, okay?

139
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,279
Hu Bobo

140
00:06:54,279 --> 00:06:54,959
You know what?

141
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,279
I have two good girlfriends.

142
00:06:58,519 --> 00:06:59,600
The two of them told me

143
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,360
Don't open a shop with Hu Da's money.

144
00:07:03,079 --> 00:07:04,399
If we use his money to open the shop,

145
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:05,680
Cut ties with me.

146
00:07:10,839 --> 00:07:12,040
I was thinking

147
00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:14,279
Why are they so dark?

148
00:07:15,279 --> 00:07:16,319
I know now.

149
00:07:17,879 --> 00:07:19,480
They are really nice to me.

150
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:21,360
What do you mean?

151
00:07:38,519 --> 00:07:39,800
This is Hu's bank card.

152
00:07:40,839 --> 00:07:42,480
I haven't touched a penny here.

153
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:45,680
Hu has nothing to do with this shop.

154
00:07:47,079 --> 00:07:47,839
Take the child.

155
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,439
You are not welcome here.

156
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:52,959
Sixsixsix

157
00:07:53,319 --> 00:07:54,040
Close the door to see them off.

158
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,279
good

159
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,120
The place is a little small.

160
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,920
But as a studio starter,

161
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:09,759
It must be enough.

162
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,319
That's enough.

163
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,079
That's great.

164
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:15,800
Is it expensive?

165
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:16,879
Look.

166
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,959
You'll get the abacus as soon as you're boss.

167
00:08:19,439 --> 00:08:22,040
You said he was just starting out.

168
00:08:22,279 --> 00:08:23,199
Stop it.

169
00:08:23,439 --> 00:08:25,199
Your T-Rex will make you poor.

170
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,879
I started my own business. I don't spend his money.

171
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,639
Miss Jia Lin.

172
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:34,080
That's it.

173
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,519
The rent is half price.

174
00:08:35,759 --> 00:08:36,759
This is a friend's house.

175
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:38,039
Pay the water and electricity bills yourself.

176
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:38,879
no problem

177
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:40,720
We will have to rely on

178
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:42,720
Su Da's manager came to help.

179
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,960
You're taking advantage of me.

180
00:08:47,159 --> 00:08:48,080
From now on, my people

181
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,440
You should use it casually, Director Zhang.

182
00:08:50,759 --> 00:08:51,720
I'm telling you,

183
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,240
If I had the money now,

184
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,639
I'll get you first.

185
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:56,440
Let's say I'm precious.

186
00:09:02,639 --> 00:09:03,440
Hello, Zhang Dong Shuai.

187
00:09:15,919 --> 00:09:16,759
Sister, you're finally here.

188
00:09:16,759 --> 00:09:17,200
What about Xiao Xiao?

189
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:17,759
Where are you?

190
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:18,919
go

191
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,000
very small

192
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,120
Jing Mei Jia Lin.

193
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:34,679
Give it to me.

194
00:09:42,879 --> 00:09:45,039
Hu is a scumbag.

195
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:46,480
All right.

196
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,080
Stop crying?

197
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:48,559
Aren't we here?

198
00:09:48,559 --> 00:09:49,320
Where's Hu?

199
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:50,679
Let's go find him.

200
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:54,679
Forget it.

201
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:55,960
He's here.

202
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,600
He's filming abroad.

203
00:09:58,720 --> 00:09:59,919
Why are you so cowardly?

204
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,399
What happened abroad?

205
00:10:02,039 --> 00:10:03,120
We need two tickets.

206
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:03,879
Jialin

207
00:10:04,279 --> 00:10:05,240
Let's pack first.

208
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,679
Let's talk about it later.

209
00:12:21,919 --> 00:12:22,360
very small

210
00:12:22,879 --> 00:12:24,639
My house is a bit old.

211
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:25,799
The room is a little small.

212
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:27,360
Make do with it.

213
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:28,559
Jialin

214
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,159
Don't say that.

215
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,120
Thank you for letting me stay.

216
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,120
We're here.

217
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:38,159
That's right.

218
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:39,759
Go back first.

219
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:40,600
It's so late.

220
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:41,399
Thank you.

221
00:12:41,799 --> 00:12:42,159
Thank you.

222
00:12:42,159 --> 00:12:42,639
I'm fine.

223
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:43,799
Anyway, I'm staying here.

224
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:45,320
Slow down.

225
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:46,240
Slow down.

226
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:46,720
go

227
00:12:48,759 --> 00:12:49,679
By the way, Zhang Dong Shuai

228
00:12:49,919 --> 00:12:50,200
sister

229
00:12:50,759 --> 00:12:52,480
I'll go to the milk tea shop tomorrow to help.

230
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:33,240
Hello, honey.

231
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:33,960
husband

232
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,639
Something happened here.

233
00:13:35,759 --> 00:13:36,960
I'm not going back tonight.

234
00:13:38,679 --> 00:13:39,799
You have to eat on time.

235
00:13:42,159 --> 00:13:43,240
I'll hang up. Bye.

236
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:09,759
Get out of here, love.

237
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,919
Get out of here, scum.

238
00:14:13,879 --> 00:14:16,200
Get out of here, central air conditioner.

239
00:14:16,879 --> 00:14:19,039
Long Yi, I love you.

240
00:14:29,039 --> 00:14:29,919
Who is it?

241
00:14:35,559 --> 00:14:36,919
Hi, little sisters.

242
00:14:36,919 --> 00:14:38,039
There's no one here.

243
00:14:41,799 --> 00:14:42,639
Thank you

244
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,120
Miss Jia Lin.

245
00:14:50,759 --> 00:14:52,919
When was Zhang Dong Shuai so thoughtful?

246
00:14:54,679 --> 00:14:55,600
A real brother.

247
00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:01,080
Much better than those scumbags.

248
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,360
Right.

249
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:05,120
reliable

250
00:15:12,799 --> 00:15:13,759
I'll go.

251
00:15:14,559 --> 00:15:15,759
Knocking on the door in the middle of the night.

252
00:15:15,759 --> 00:15:17,200
What are you doing?

253
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,000
Why haven't you returned it?

254
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:25,919
Jingmei.

255
00:15:26,519 --> 00:15:27,559
one's master's/teacher's son who is older than oneself

256
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:29,320
Is Jialin there?

257
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:30,519
in

258
00:15:30,519 --> 00:15:31,360
It's not closed.

259
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,440
Don't.

260
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:33,039
Jialin

261
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:34,240
I'll just say one thing.

262
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,159
Jialin,

263
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:46,759
Jialin, I was wrong.

264
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:47,799
I know what to do from now on.

265
00:15:47,799 --> 00:15:49,159
I understand why you're angry with me.

266
00:15:49,159 --> 00:15:49,879
I bought something for you.

267
00:15:49,879 --> 00:15:50,440
Eat while it's hot.

268
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,759
And I bought a movie ticket and put it in this bag.

269
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:52,879
I only invited you this time.

270
00:15:52,879 --> 00:15:54,200
The Youth Cinema

271
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:54,960
Let's be there or be square.

272
00:15:55,399 --> 00:15:56,000
You must come.

273
00:15:56,039 --> 00:15:56,639
Be sure to wait!

274
00:15:56,759 --> 00:15:57,320
I definitely will.

275
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:05,679
Why are you so good at this?

276
00:16:09,799 --> 00:16:11,000
What is this delicious?

277
00:16:11,559 --> 00:16:12,200
Let me see.

278
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:19,159
fragrant

279
00:16:22,919 --> 00:16:23,440
It smells so good.

280
00:16:23,919 --> 00:16:24,559
one's master's/teacher's son who is older than oneself

281
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:25,919
That's great.

282
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:27,679
stick

283
00:16:28,559 --> 00:16:29,200

00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:34,120
Jia Lin,

285
00:16:36,039 --> 00:16:38,799
Do you want to think about it?

286
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:41,879
consider

287
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,879
Eating meat can't stop you two.

288
00:16:47,559 --> 00:16:48,480
I'm telling you,

289
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:50,879
No one is allowed to mention men tonight.

290
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,120
Who wants to talk about men?

291
00:16:52,519 --> 00:16:53,799
You two are anxious.

292
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:54,720
drink

293
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:55,840
I'm anxious to see you.

294
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:57,559
Drink up.

295
00:16:58,159 --> 00:16:59,519
Where is the wine?

296
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:01,559
Where is the wine?

297
00:17:01,559 --> 00:17:03,039
Cheers!

298
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:25,720
Thank you

299
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:27,039
Let's go.

300
00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:28,160
Do you often come here for dinner?

301
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:28,720
That's right.

302
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:30,480
I usually order this place.

303
00:17:37,079 --> 00:17:39,039
Your selection difficulty hasn't recovered yet.

304
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:39,799
That's it.

305
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,279
Pan-fried Fresh Scallops with Foie Gras

306

Two servings each.

310
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:47,359
Thank you

311
00:17:48,079 --> 00:17:48,599
You ordered so many.

312
00:17:48,599 --> 00:17:49,480
It's not good to waste it.

313
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:50,480
Correct!

314
00:17:51,519 --> 00:17:53,160
The best French wine here.

315
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:53,799
Give me another bottle.

316
00:17:54,839 --> 00:17:55,680
I can't. I'll pack it up.

317
00:17:56,119 --> 00:17:56,759
Do you have a problem with that?

318
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:58,759
I didn't serve the dishes.

319
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,160
Okay, please wait a moment.

320
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:02,960
I'm not familiar with domestic restaurants.

321
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:03,960
Why don't you come?

322
00:18:06,519 --> 00:18:09,079
Do you have any chef's recommendations?

323
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:11,920
French escargot and Parisian lobster

324
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,079

00:18:18,599 --> 00:18:19,119
That's

326
00:18:20,079 --> 00:18:21,319
That's foie gras and fresh scallops.

327
00:18:21,759 --> 00:18:23,200
Is also our signature dish.

328
00:18:24,079 --> 00:18:24,480
can

329
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:25,480
Have one.

330
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:26,240
OK

331
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:29,519
Okay, thank you.

332
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:34,720
It's good. Try it.

333
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:36,079
Xuan Yi.

334
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:38,279
White wine, red wine.

335
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:38,799

00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:46,960
Both of them.

338
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:48,359
Then red wine.

339
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:50,599
OK

340
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:01,559
Which one?

341
00:19:03,599 --> 00:19:05,079
it is nothing

342
00:19:05,319 --> 00:19:06,039
Eat and eat.

343
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:07,559
This is delicious.

344
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:11,799
Xuan Yi.

345
00:19:12,119 --> 00:19:12,799
This year,

346
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,559
To move the European industry back home.

347
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,079
I heard from my dad,

348
00:19:16,759 --> 00:19:18,079
Your Long Chen Foundation is doing well.

349
00:19:18,599 --> 00:19:20,079
Maybe we will cooperate in the future.

350
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:23,200
Xuan Yi.

351
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:28,200
sorry

352
00:19:29,359 --> 00:19:30,839
I'm not feeling well today.

353
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,319
How about we meet some other day?

354
00:19:32,599 --> 00:19:33,319
No problem.

355
00:19:33,799 --> 00:19:34,400
Sorry

356
00:19:34,599 --> 00:19:35,119
it doesn't matter

357
00:19:43,759 --> 00:19:44,400
Chen Xuan Yi.

358
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:49,480
What Chen Xuan Yi?

359
00:19:50,119 --> 00:19:50,880
Eat, eat.

360
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:51,839
What?

361
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:54,000
With your eyes,

362
00:19:54,599 --> 00:19:55,480
I didn't know you.

363
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,319
The waiter will pack it.

364
00:20:03,279 --> 00:20:03,920
What are you talking about?

365
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:04,799
Just eat here.

366
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:05,519
We haven't finished yet.

367
00:20:06,759 --> 00:20:07,640
I don't want

368
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:09,480
You're thinking about other women.

369
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:11,559
Thank you for dinner.

370
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:13,880
I let you off.

371
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:15,759
Make yourself at home.

372
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:20,880
Put it here when you're ready.

373
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:21,799
I'm going to the bathroom.

374
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:22,640
I'll come back later.

375
00:20:22,759 --> 00:20:23,759
Linda

376
00:20:44,759 --> 00:20:45,799
What are you doing?

377
00:20:46,599 --> 00:20:48,079
Who kidnapped her?

378
00:20:53,519 --> 00:20:54,200
Who are you?

379
00:20:55,119 --> 00:20:56,279
Chen Xuan Yi ignored you.

380
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:57,160
You remember me.

381
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,680
Give up your jewelry store like this?

382
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:06,119
Are you willing?

383
00:21:07,799 --> 00:21:09,200
And let Chen Xuanyi abandon her.

384
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:10,920
Are you willing?

385
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:13,599
I had no choice.

386
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:15,400
What about you?

387
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:16,799
No more than two days.

388
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,400
It's hopeless.

389
00:21:21,839 --> 00:21:22,640
Why stick to it?

390
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:26,799
When we opened,

391
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,559
Isn't it ambitious?

392
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:33,519
It's too hasty.

393
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:36,359
Zhang Jingmei said

394
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:44,559
You have to admit your mistake to move forward.

395
00:21:45,559 --> 00:21:46,400
I think it's right.

396
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:48,519
So I decided

397
00:21:50,759 --> 00:21:51,559
Drop your posture.

398
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:53,119
Restart

399
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:56,400
No

400
00:21:57,359 --> 00:21:58,480
Why are you doing this?

401
00:21:59,319 --> 00:22:00,920
Young Master of the Long Family,

402
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:03,400
Why are you doing this to a small shop?

403
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,039
It's not a waste of life.

404
00:22:07,119 --> 00:22:08,400
If I don't do anything,

405
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,759
My life will be nothing but a waste.

406
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:12,880
I just think

407
00:22:14,519 --> 00:22:15,440
What else can I do?

408
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:17,359
You're capable of many things.

409
00:22:18,079 --> 00:22:18,920
What?

410
00:22:20,599 --> 00:22:21,960
I used to think so.

411
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,240
Now I know who I am.

412
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:27,400
Brother

413
00:22:28,119 --> 00:22:28,599
Look at me.

414
00:22:30,079 --> 00:22:30,599
I

415
00:22:31,599 --> 00:22:35,519
You are nothing but a dragon.

416
00:22:39,559 --> 00:22:40,799
Is it as serious as you said?

417
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:42,440
Can it be?

418
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:46,720
Zhang Jingmei likes to have goals and ambitions.

419
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:48,599
And people who work hard for their goals

420
00:22:50,359 --> 00:22:50,759
I

421
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:52,839
Let's not talk about the ideal.

422
00:22:53,599 --> 00:22:55,039
I can't even

423
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:56,440
I don't know anything about it.

424
00:23:00,079 --> 00:23:01,000
Or Zhang Jingmei?

425
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:03,400
For myself.

426
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:11,319
Zhang Jingmei has really changed you a lot.

427
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:12,920
Brother, you know what?

428
00:23:14,319 --> 00:23:17,839
Love is built on the trust of two people

429
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:21,079
And appreciate it,

430
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,240
We can't do anything less.

431
00:23:27,079 --> 00:23:27,680
That's right.

432
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:31,480
Chen Xuan Yi doesn't rely on me at all.

433
00:23:34,279 --> 00:23:35,519
I must become

434
00:23:35,519 --> 00:23:37,640
The man that Zhang Jingmei admires.

435
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:38,680
Certain

436
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:41,759
No matter how hard I try,

437
00:23:42,279 --> 00:23:44,640
Can't be the one she wants to rely on.
