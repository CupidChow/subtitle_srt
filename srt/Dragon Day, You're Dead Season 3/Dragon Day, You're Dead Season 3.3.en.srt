00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:53,920
Mrs. Long,

172
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,450
this is our Eternal series.

173
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:07,490
I want this.

174
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:15,910
Manager,

175
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:18,520
do we have anything else?

176
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,180
This is the treasure of our town store.

177
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:24,270
Honey,

178
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,130
what do you think of this?

179
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:27,590
I still like this one.

180
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:31,280
What's so good about this?

181
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:33,200
You can wear this small one often.

182
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,040
If you buy this big one for me,

183
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,690
I'll take it off when I squeeze the bus.

184
00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:37,940
You have to take it off when you're working,

185
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:39,720
and you have to take it off when you wash your hands.

186
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:40,450
It's not convenient.

187
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,400
If you insist on

188
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:47,250
buying me this big one,

189
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:48,080
It's okay.

190
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:50,520
I can't wear it often anyway.

191
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:52,660
People won't know I'm married.

192
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,700
Or does Mrs. Long have a good taste?

193
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:55,960
I'll take this one.

194
00:11:57,290 --> 00:11:57,920
Well,

195
00:11:59,330 --> 00:11:59,980
what are you doing?

196
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:01,020
Put it on.

197
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:15,810
Wrap this up, too.

198
00:12:16,430 --> 00:12:16,820
Okay.

199
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:30,690
Jingmei,

200
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:33,140
Zhang Jingmei.

201
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:39,360
What are you doing?

202
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,500
Chief,

203
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:42,200
I've been calling you for a long time.

204
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,160
Why is there no response?

205
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:44,250
I'm sorry.

206
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:45,330
All right. What's that?

207
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:46,830
Go find a mansion,

208
00:12:46,830 --> 00:12:47,550
and take photos in the next two days.

209
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:53,470
Director,

210
00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:55,020
in these two days'preparation notice,

211
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:55,830
I didn't ask for a mansion,

212
00:12:55,830 --> 00:12:57,190
a new play by the director,

213
00:12:57,450 --> 00:12:58,460
I only need it for a few days. Go

214
00:12:58,920 --> 00:12:59,620
and find it.

215
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,310
That would be great.

216
00:13:01,310 --> 00:13:04,560
How inhuman Hao is.

217
00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:10,990
Be gentle.

218
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:12,400
Don't get it dirty.

219
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:12,960
Okay.

220
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:14,940
Is this considered marriage?

221
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:16,150
Honey,

222
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:17,000
my daughter is getting older,

223
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,440
You have to marry if you should.

224
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:20,640
There seems to be something wrong.

225
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:22,050
What else could be wrong?

226
00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:23,480
Isn't it a matter of time or night?

227
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:24,450
Don't you think

228
00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:26,290
it's a little hasty?

229
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:28,020
Mom and Dad,

230
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:28,710
it's done.

231
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:31,000
Say something?

232
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:33,050
That's right.

233
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:36,090
What should I say?

234
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,310
Xiaoyi

235
00:13:38,570 --> 00:13:38,930
Dad.

236
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:43,380
Drive slowly.

237
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:44,160
Okay Dad,

238
00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:45,640
brother-in-law,

239
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:46,880
There's a table in the room. Let's

240
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:47,620
move out together.

241
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:48,100
Take up some space.

242
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:50,820
Someone will move the table

243
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:51,860
when you come back.

244
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:53,600
Xiaoyi

245
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:54,650
Dad,

246
00:13:55,510 --> 00:13:57,960
I don't think it's too early to ask Dad to do it.

247
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:58,440
Okay Dad,

248
00:14:01,170 --> 00:14:02,120
why isn't he here yet?

249
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:04,440
It's been half an hour. Are you

250
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:05,500
going or not?

251
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:07,410
Wait.

252
00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:08,790
It's a charge on time anyway.

253
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:09,130
Right?

254
00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:10,180
What's there to talk about?

255
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:11,890
How about this?

256
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:14,390
There will be another one to move after moving this house.

257
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:25,780
Yi,

258
00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:27,680
why did you stay?

259
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,280
Your aunt and I

260
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:31,090
want to discuss it with you.

261
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:32,500
Dad,

262
00:14:34,030 --> 00:14:34,890
You are my father

263
00:14:35,810 --> 00:14:36,660
and my mother.

264
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:37,350
Farewell,

265
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:39,630
you changed your mind in such a confused way,

266
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:40,760
It's so inappropriate.

267
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:44,190
We haven't changed your red envelope yet.

268
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:46,240
No red envelope,

269
00:14:46,490 --> 00:14:47,480
just change it.

270
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:49,720
Brother-in-law,

271
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:51,630
my mom didn't mean that.

272
00:14:52,450 --> 00:14:53,380
What does that mean?

273
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:56,340
Yi, look,

274
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:59,120
this house has been emptied by you.

275
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,950
Jingmei was also taken away by you.

276
00:15:02,130 --> 00:15:05,410
Now we're the only ones left.

277
00:15:05,770 --> 00:15:08,530
Looking at this empty room,

278
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:09,890
I'm in a bad mood,

279
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,290
Mom, I'm still here.

280
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:14,520
Then why don't I

281
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,060
pick you two up to stay at my place.

282
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:18,580
I happen to have a few vacant bedrooms.

283
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:19,670
Okay.

284
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:24,570
Brother-in-law sincerely invited me

285
00:15:25,930 --> 00:15:28,240
to move in with you, so there's no need.

286
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,650
We are still used to living at home.

287
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:32,030
Yes.

288
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:34,830
However,

289
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:37,200
we have few relatives,

290
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,370
Two tables are enough.

291
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:39,560
It's easy to say the time,

292
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:41,360
but of course it's a holiday.

293
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,440
They are all wage earners.

294
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:43,320
It's not easy to ask for leave.

295
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,210
What are

296
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:45,780
your family's plans?

297
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:49,780
Me,

298
00:15:50,770 --> 00:15:52,030
This one in my house,

299
00:15:52,030 --> 00:15:52,760
Brother-in-law,

300
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:54,380
Don't play dumb.

301
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:56,060
My sister went to your house all night.

302
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:57,470
You can't spend nine yuan to get a certificate.

303
00:15:57,470 --> 00:15:58,630
Let's not talk about black or white.

304
00:15:58,630 --> 00:16:00,720
Bring it up.

305
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:03,680
What do you mean?

306
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:04,410
Yi,

307
00:16:04,410 --> 00:16:06,010
let's not beat around the bush.

308
00:16:06,010 --> 00:16:07,720
This is your marriage.

309
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,510
What are you going to do with this?

310
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:10,180
Didn't your lord

311
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:12,030
discuss the schedule with you?

312
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:13,270
When will you do it?

313
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:14,640
When your Long family marries a wife,

314
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:15,980
you can't just sneak around

315
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:16,900
and let it go.

316
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:17,760
You can't do it.

317
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:18,750
We can do it, too.

318
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:20,700
At worst, I'll marry you to the Zhang family.

319
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:22,280
Although our place isn't that big,

320
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:24,730
at least we're well-mannered.

321
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,280
Mom and Dad,

322
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,590
you are so domineering.

323
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:34,040
Mom and Dad,

324
00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:36,510
I'll do it

325
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:38,770
Do it.

326
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:45,830
Who acted in this drama?

327
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:47,120
Deng Manfei and Meng Hao,

328
00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:48,300
Who?

329
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,290
Why haven't I heard of it?

330
00:16:51,290 --> 00:16:52,690
They've been popular lately,

331
00:16:52,690 --> 00:16:53,970
and their acting skills are pretty good.

332
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:55,300
Most importantly,

333
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:57,030
the script of our play is very good,

334
00:16:57,030 --> 00:16:57,920
Is the script

335
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,320
well written?

336
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:01,720
Brother,

337
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:04,920
You don't have to worry about the producer.

338
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:21,160
Dad,

339
00:17:21,770 --> 00:17:22,910
When are you coming back?

340
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:23,760
Yi,

341
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,590
I'm in a hurry to catch Charles de Gaulle Airport.

342
00:17:25,590 --> 00:17:26,680
I'll fly to Germany now.

343
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:27,680
What can I do for you?

344
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,080
I couldn't tell you clearly on the phone.

345
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:30,440
I'll talk to you when you're back.

346
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:31,530
I'll be back for a while.

347
00:17:31,530 --> 00:17:33,240
I still have several countries to run to.

348
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:35,990
You can talk to your brother if you need anything.

349
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:37,050
All right, I'm hanging up.

350
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:39,050
Yi, can I help you?

351
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:40,950
What could have happened to him?

352
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,300
I'll ask him to go to Haiyi.

353
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:44,160
Okay. I'll explain it to him.

354
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:45,730
Let's go.

355
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:53,130
Brother, what's up?

356
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:54,120
I'm in the middle of a meeting.

357
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:54,650
Brother,

358
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,200
How is it? What have you

359
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,340
been up to lately?

360
00:17:58,670 --> 00:18:00,670
I'll do the work of these two people alone.

361
00:18:01,090 --> 00:18:02,700
Your office is in ashes.

362
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,790
I'm not going to clean it up.

363
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:05,520
Hey,

364
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:07,940
Hello, brother,

365
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:08,940
Hey,

366
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:10,210
Brother, my signal is not good.

367
00:18:10,210 --> 00:18:11,320
I'll hang up now.

368
00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:16,910
Take a look at these scenes,

369
00:18:16,910 --> 00:18:17,670
they are all literary plays,

370
00:18:17,670 --> 00:18:18,960
He didn't move at all.

371
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,730
We promise we can finish it quietly.

372
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:21,800
Just for half a day.

373
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:22,670
Thank you.

374
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:24,460
No, no, no.

375
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:26,650
The management of our community is very strict.

376
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:27,900
We can't disturb the owners.

377
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,880
But the owner has agreed.

378
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:31,600
I don't agree.

379
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:36,430
This is the master bedroom downstairs,

380
00:18:36,430 --> 00:18:38,360
and that is the kitchen and storage room.

381
00:18:38,770 --> 00:18:40,500
There are also four bedrooms

382
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:41,810
and three washrooms upstairs,

383
00:18:41,810 --> 00:18:43,220
And there's a big open-air balcony,

384
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:44,480
320 square meters in total,

385
00:18:44,930 --> 00:18:45,940
May I ask,

386
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:47,160
is this house yours?

387
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:48,260
No,

388
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:49,130
but the owner

389
00:18:49,130 --> 00:18:50,760
has entrusted the house to me.

390
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:52,160
Entrust you to buy and sell, right?

391
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:54,320
But we only rent it for one day,

392
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,830
so I think we should tell the owner.

393
00:18:56,830 --> 00:18:57,480
No need.

394
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:58,340
What's your budget?

395
00:18:58,340 --> 00:18:59,830
Let's discuss it

396
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,000
and use it.

397
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:04,280
You brat.

398
00:19:04,690 --> 00:19:06,740
You finally know how to call grandpa.

399
00:19:07,430 --> 00:19:08,040
Grandpa,

400
00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:10,470
what have you been up to lately?

401
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:11,280
When are you coming back?

402
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,410
Why do you miss grandpa?

403
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:15,050
I miss you so much.

404
00:19:15,050 --> 00:19:16,450
You've been in Australia for three months,

405
00:19:16,450 --> 00:19:17,960
but you didn't come back to see me.

406
00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:20,210
Tell me. What is it?

407
00:19:20,210 --> 00:19:22,680
Your dad and your brother can't do it for you.

408
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:25,360
What could possibly happen to me?

409
00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:27,550
I just miss you too much, don't I?

410
00:19:27,730 --> 00:19:28,560
Really?

411
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:30,200
Do you miss me?

412
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:32,810
I'll hang up now.

413
00:19:32,810 --> 00:19:35,320
Your grandpa Chen and I are talking about the project here.

414
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:37,830
Grandpa, I … I … I want to

415
00:19:38,290 --> 00:19:41,190
get married,

416
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:43,880
It's a good thing.

417
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:46,060
He said no on the phone,

418
00:19:46,490 --> 00:19:48,220
we have to think it over.

419
00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:50,410
No, grandpa,

420
00:19:50,410 --> 00:19:52,830
no matter how big things are, I have to take my time.

421
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:53,320
Well,

422
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:54,860
talk it over

423
00:19:55,690 --> 00:19:56,850
with your parents,

424
00:19:56,850 --> 00:19:58,110
When Grandpa returns to the country,

425
00:19:58,430 --> 00:19:59,530
we'll discuss it in detail.

426
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:06,280
What's there to talk about with Chen Sheng Yuan?

427
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:08,200
We've been talking for three months and we're not tired.

428
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:21,050
Chen,

429
00:20:21,050 --> 00:20:22,470
you've been playing tricks all your life.

430
00:20:23,050 --> 00:20:24,870
I finally met my nemesis today.

431
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:28,520
Nonsense.

432
00:20:29,670 --> 00:20:32,440
When did I, Chen Sheng Yuan, ever cheat?

433
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:34,130
Yes.

434
00:20:34,130 --> 00:20:35,550
Grandpa, you never cheat,

435
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,010
but if you suffer from

436
00:20:37,010 --> 00:20:38,400
high blood pressure again,

437
00:20:38,590 --> 00:20:39,600
I don't care about you anymore.

438
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:41,500
No matter

439
00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:43,300
how stubborn you are, Chen,

440
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,320
I really envy you.

441
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:46,880
You have such a sweet granddaughter,

442
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:50,430
and your two grandchildren,

443
00:20:50,670 --> 00:20:52,360
Each one is better than the other.

444
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:55,030
Aren't you proud enough?

445
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:57,320
Those two dragon boys,

446
00:20:57,930 --> 00:20:59,520
their scales haven't grown together yet.

447
00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:02,100
It needs to be honed.

448
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:04,140
Xuanyi,

449
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,160
do you still remember when you were little,

450
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:07,860
The two dragon brothers who stole the handle

451
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:09,090
of your game console?

452
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:10,120
I remember,

453
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:13,210
but the one who grabbed my handle,

454
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:14,190
There's only one person,

455
00:21:15,230 --> 00:21:15,970
Long Yi

456
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:19,830
That boy is not that lucky.

457
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:21,830
Really?

458
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:25,050
Just tell me the truth.

459
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:26,930
How much can I pay for one day's shooting?

460
00:21:26,930 --> 00:21:28,340
6. 1 Thousand Day,

461
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:30,640
6 Thousand.

462
00:21:31,430 --> 00:21:33,080
My house has just been renovated.

463
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:34,480
In fact, if we only shoot for half a day,

464
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:35,390
we won't damage

465
00:21:35,390 --> 00:21:36,520
your house and furniture.

466
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:37,360
Don't worry,

467
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,790
I just finished waxing the floor,

468
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:41,550
The Turkey carpet in the living room is also new.

469
00:21:42,130 --> 00:21:44,900
How much do you think is appropriate?

470
00:21:46,850 --> 00:21:47,760
It's

471
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:49,710
50 thousand anyway,

472
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:50,750
50thousand,

473
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:53,140
but our budget is really limited.

474
00:21:53,710 --> 00:21:56,210
How about 7thousand?

475
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,420
Think of it as supporting the film and television industry.

476
00:21:58,630 --> 00:21:59,780
48thousand can't be less than 8thousand,

477
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:01,430
please help me.

478
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:04,350
I've been running for a whole day and I'm tired.

479
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:05,970
I've seen a lot of houses,

480
00:22:05,970 --> 00:22:08,100
and I think your house is the most beautiful.

481
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:09,540
Look at your decoration,

482
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:10,400
you are

483
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,820
a very aesthetic person,

484
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:13,430
Look at the outfit you're wearing today,

485
00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:14,570
you look so handsome.

486
00:22:14,570 --> 00:22:17,270
You don't need our money at all, do you?

487
00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:19,280
You're a good talker,

488
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:22,980
so can your star take photos and sign autographs?

489
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:24,130
I can't do that.

490
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:26,170
This is not a luxury guide

491
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:28,110
We have a limited budget,

492
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:29,640
Besides, we're in a hurry this time,

493
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:30,540
we can't do that.

494
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:32,990
This scene is very important.

495
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:35,360
I have to be responsible for art.

496
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:36,960
I'll talk to them about it,

497
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,520
ask them to display it well,

498
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:38,860
Director,

499
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:39,790
you can't.

500
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:41,530
Can it be the same thing?

501
00:22:41,530 --> 00:22:42,380
This is totally different

502
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:43,770
from what I was thinking.

503
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:44,770
Let's look for it again.

504
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:48,680
Little girl, you've never seen the world.

505
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,140
Isn't it a waste of time?

506
00:22:53,910 --> 00:22:54,900
Director,

507
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:55,970
the budget you gave me,

508
00:22:55,970 --> 00:22:57,620
This is already the best.

509
