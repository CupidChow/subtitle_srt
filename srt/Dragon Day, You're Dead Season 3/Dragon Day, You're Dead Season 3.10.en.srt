(Look)

173
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:39,810
(Those numbers are moving),

174
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,010
(Are you okay? )

175
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:45,820
Time's up.

176
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:47,890
Which student will answer?

177
00:08:47,890 --> 00:08:48,550
-She... -He.

178
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:08,660
Is that okay?

179
00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:10,850
Of course,

180
00:09:11,890 --> 00:09:13,310
I'm the treasure man!

181
00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:16,330
Treasure man,

182
00:09:16,770 --> 00:09:17,700
we're even now,

183
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:18,560
I'm leaving.

184
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:21,800
You've already thanked me.

185
00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:22,490
Did you?

186
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:24,800
This is the first time you've been with me.

187
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:25,860
More than ten minutes.

188
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,230
I'm sorry,

189
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:34,770
sir. Our hotel is closed.

190
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:36,700
Maintenance personnel are not allowed to enter the passenger elevator.

191
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,010
Annoying.

192
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,440
I told you,

193
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,460
you insisted that he role-play the maintenance man,

194
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,650
I should have been wearing a nurse's outfit.

195
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:49,360
You,

196
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:51,840
Can you let the nurse in?

197
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:54,970
I'm sorry,

198
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:56,430
sir. I made a mistake. Please come in.

199
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:11,700
(Porcelain of all ages, Chinese calligraphy).

200
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:24,230
Honey,

201
00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:27,960
can you do it tomorrow?

202
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:32,970
Mr. Momo said,

203
00:10:33,450 --> 00:10:35,780
today is the end of the day.

204
00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:38,460
Otherwise, she'll deduct my points again.

205
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,460
If you're sleepy, go to bed first.

206
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:42,320
If you don't sleep,

207
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,910
I can't sleep together.

208
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:51,680
Why don't you do your homework with me.

209
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,890
You'd better do your homework with me.

210
00:10:57,110 --> 00:10:58,010
Stop messing around.

211
00:10:58,010 --> 00:10:59,070
Who's messing with you?

212
00:10:59,070 --> 00:11:01,330
-Don't be so annoying. -I'm not messing with you.

213
00:11:01,330 --> 00:11:03,300
Three points will be deducted for laughing and joking.

214
00:11:32,210 --> 00:11:33,120
Grandpa,

215
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,300
grandpa

216
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:39,020
finished his class early.

217
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:40,510
Just finished.

218
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:45,050
Why are you standing so far away?

219
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:46,890
Am I that scary?

220
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:53,380
Not many.

221
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:54,510
Sit down. Come

222
00:11:54,510 --> 00:11:55,450
and sit down.

223
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:07,530
You must be bored at home these days.

224
00:12:07,530 --> 00:12:08,060
No.

225
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:09,540
I've learned a lot Grandpa,

226
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:12,100
I'll ask Momo to teach you.

227
00:12:12,890 --> 00:12:14,450
I didn't mean to punish you.

228
00:12:15,570 --> 00:12:18,520
I just want you to get used to your identity as soon as possible.

229
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:21,190
Because everything you say and do

230
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:23,820
will be seen by others.

231
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:26,600
Is it a compliment or a demeaning?

232
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:29,020
I can't bear it for you.

233
00:12:30,770 --> 00:12:33,010
But my granddaughter-in-law, Long Zaiyuan,

234
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,920
must not be looked down upon.

235
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:37,230
Got it?

236
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:39,230
Thank you, Grandpa.

237
00:12:41,130 --> 00:12:41,740
Eat up.

238
00:12:47,530 --> 00:12:48,890
What are you doing today?

239
00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:52,080
Grandpa,

240
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:54,020
I've been learning

241
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:57,180
a very useful subject recently,

242
00:12:58,390 --> 00:13:00,900
I've been learning this rule and practicing

243
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:02,440
with Zhang Jingmei and Momo,

244
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,370
You've benefited a lot.

245
00:13:03,370 --> 00:13:04,370
Really?

246
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,600
Right?

247
00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:11,560
How is the schedule of Juanlaoren Village

248
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:12,990
going that day?

249
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:18,780
I think it's next week.

250
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,620
Looks like I'm getting old.

251
00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:25,010
I thought it was today,

252
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:27,210
Grandpa,

253
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:28,180
No,

254
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:29,880
Xuan Yi can just do

255
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:32,170
this kind of work on the table. I,

256
00:13:32,170 --> 00:13:33,520
Xuanyi's surname is Chen,

257
00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:35,440
can she represent the Long family?

258
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:38,500
Me

259
00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:41,320
Take Jing Mei with you.

260
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:51,200
From now on,

261
00:13:52,810 --> 00:13:54,450
you don't have to stay at home.

262
00:13:55,510 --> 00:13:56,570
But remember,

263
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:59,570
you go out and do what you say and do.

264
00:13:59,570 --> 00:14:00,620
Every move,

265
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:02,150
represents the grandson and granddaughter-in-law

266
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:04,930
of my Long Family and Long Zaiyuan,

267
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:07,570
I can't let anyone look down on me.

268
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:08,850
Do you understand?

269
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:09,310
Got it.

270
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11,020
-Got it. -Grandpa, have

271
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:12,720
a good meal. We

272
00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:32,400
used to be an

273
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:34,760
ordinary village here.

274
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:36,960
But our place is surrounded by mountains and rivers,

275
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,250
and the environment is very good.

276
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:39,890
At first,

277
00:14:40,410 --> 00:14:42,450
it was because all the young people went to the city,

278
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:45,710
The house is empty.

279
00:14:46,610 --> 00:14:49,420
He sold some old houses at a low price.

280
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:51,810
Later, the old people came here together

281
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:54,730
to support their old age.

282
00:14:54,730 --> 00:14:56,960
They remodeled that old house.

283
00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:00,110
It's so pretty.

284
00:15:02,130 --> 00:15:02,720
Look at

285
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:03,850
that one,

286
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:07,120
That area is the first house

287
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,510
that Mr. Xu and the others rebuilt,

288
00:15:09,730 --> 00:15:11,960
It turns out that life can still be so beautiful.

289
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:14,250
I really hope that more old people

290
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:15,670
can enjoy their old age

291
00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:17,460
like them. There will be more and more of them.

292
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:21,200
As soon as we cooperate with Longchen Foundation,

293
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:23,060
Village Head,

294
00:15:23,970 --> 00:15:24,940
Our foundation

295
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:27,300
really focuses on the quality of life.

296
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:28,230
You're right.

297
00:15:29,330 --> 00:15:30,420
Let me ask you one more question,

298
00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:31,440
Village Head. Well,

299
00:15:31,690 --> 00:15:33,450
Are these houses

300
00:15:33,450 --> 00:15:35,190
designed by the old people themselves?

301
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:37,120
Most of them are,

302
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:40,740
although these old people are old,

303
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:44,340
That's really where dragons hide and tigers crouch.

304
00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:55,170
Young Master Long, look,

305
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:56,930
that's Grandma Qin.

306
00:15:57,900 --> 00:15:59,110
Where's Grandma Qin?

307
00:15:59,510 --> 00:16:03,090
A few years ago, when her lover was gone,

308
00:16:03,570 --> 00:16:05,730
she just played it like this.

309
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,640
Although her children are very dutiful,

310
00:16:10,210 --> 00:16:13,440
she is very depressed.

311
00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:15,840
Ever since I moved here,

312
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:17,600
I feel much better.

313
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:18,630
Look.

314
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:10,730
What is this old man writing?

315
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:20,180
Since ancient times, it has been called "The First Birthday of the Rare Master".

316
00:17:20,530 --> 00:17:22,530
Guess what the next couplet is?

317
00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:24,900
From now on, Joy of Life

318
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:26,290
is not bad. Young people

319
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:28,430
can do it, Mrs. Long.

320
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,050
Mr. Momo taught me that.

321
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:31,840
Where's the horizontal batch?

322
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:35,330
Mr. Long is not bad

323
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:38,290
to support the rest of the world.

324
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:39,940
Well,

325
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,610
Mr. Momo also taught me,

326
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:45,830
Let's get it for you, sir. -Help

327
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,860
me, honey. -Okay, okay.

328
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:50,580
Well written.

329
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:52,880
How's it going, honey?

330
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:53,800
Are you sticking it right,

331
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:55,630
honey?

332
00:17:56,190 --> 00:17:58,300
When we get old,

333
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:01,040
will we be as happy as they are now?

334
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:02,140
Of course.

335
00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:06,610
You don't have any other ideas, do you?

336
00:18:07,810 --> 00:18:08,900
Look at your performance.

337
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:11,830
Look at what performance?

338
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:13,010
Honey.

339
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,110
This afternoon,

340
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:19,590
Long Yi and his wife from Long Group,

341
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:21,260
On behalf of Longchen Fund,

342
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:22,690
I visited Tianjuan Old Man Village.

343
00:18:23,090 --> 00:18:25,560
Jing Meizhen is on camera.

344
00:18:26,170 --> 00:18:27,280
You've been pretty

345
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:28,720
since you were a kid.

346
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:29,890
You're annoying

347
00:18:30,390 --> 00:18:32,100
When I was young and beautiful,

348
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:34,050
I believed your stupid mouth.

349
00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:36,580
What?

350
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:38,720
I didn't look good when I was a kid.

351
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:40,240
-Nice. -You were so pretty when

352
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,800
you were a kid.

353
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,020
It's just that you've changed when you grow up.

354
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:48,790
According to reporters at the scene,

355
00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:50,740
this rich granddaughter-in-law who is close to the people,

356
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:52,800
He won numerous praises as soon as he came out.

357
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:54,800
Not only the image is elegant and decent,

358
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,710
but also the personality is kind and close to people,

359
00:18:58,510 --> 00:19:00,770
My daughter has grown up.

360
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:04,990
The outside world has speculated that

361
00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:07,200
the Dragon-Chen Alliance may once again create

362
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,470
the business miracle of the Year of the Dragon Alliance.

363
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:12,720
The Long Family still hasn't cooperated with Nian Family this time,

364
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:13,630
does it confirm the reason that

365
00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:15,730
the Long Family and Nian Family passed away because

366
00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:17,580
of Nian Shilan,

367
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:19,070
There are major contradictions,

368
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,120
(Shi Lan),

369
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:25,070
(The Long family has forgotten all about you. ).

370
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:33,030
I'll give you three days,

371
00:19:34,130 --> 00:19:36,370
so Longchen Fund won't be able to turn over.

372
00:19:44,290 --> 00:19:44,950
Honey,

373
00:19:45,770 --> 00:19:48,210
I found out that the Long family I saw on TV,

374
00:19:48,210 --> 00:19:49,870
It's quite different from

375
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:51,710
the real Long Family.

376
00:19:53,490 --> 00:19:55,730
It's more tiring to experience it personally, isn't it?

377
00:19:55,730 --> 00:19:56,880
No,

378
00:19:58,340 --> 00:19:59,840
I finally know

379
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:02,320
why Grandpa wants us to go to the village?

380
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,640
For Longchen Fund.

381
00:20:04,630 --> 00:20:05,810
No,

382
00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:08,040
it's for us to grow up.

383
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:11,590
I'm sorry,

384
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:12,660
honey. I can't help it.

385
00:20:13,450 --> 00:20:14,660
As a member of the Long family,

386
00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:16,670
I was born with these two words.

387
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:19,970
You have nothing to be sorry for.

388
00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:22,900
You have to thank the Long family for giving you all this.

389
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,890
And I want to thank the Long family,

390
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:26,360
for giving me such a good you.

391
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:28,090
Miss Jingmei,

392
00:20:28,090 --> 00:20:29,440
I suggest you go to bed early.

393
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:31,970
Because the classes we left behind from going out today,

394
00:20:31,970 --> 00:20:33,920
we have to start filling them up early tomorrow morning,

395
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:35,840
Got it, Mr. Momo.

396
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:37,410
I'll go to bed soon.

397
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:40,000
This one

398

Madam Long,

399
00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:45,920
you should rest with your husband earlier.

400
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:49,620
Mr. Long,

401
00:20:50,330 --> 00:20:52,100
when I shower and change my clothes,

402
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:53,910
I'll warm the bed for you.

403
00:20:58,090 --> 00:20:59,010
Let's go.

remember to change your uniform,

What about the bag?

Your mom is reliable.

How long have you been waiting?

415
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:16,080
It's already broken the record anyway.

416
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,180
Better than Hu.

417

You're here so early,

427
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:37,430
why did you come to the school gate?

428
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:39,470
I thought you were looking for us to recall your childhood.

429
00:21:41,310 --> 00:21:43,140
So you broke up with Hu.

430
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:45,100
He even assigned his son to your name.

431
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:48,150
I'm risking

432
00:21:48,150 --> 00:21:50,610
being punished for standing for five hours.

433
00:21:50,610 --> 00:21:52,390
I skipped class and came out to look for you.

434
00:21:52,850 --> 00:21:54,500
If you tell us that you're here today,

435
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,240
you're here to hear the news

436

that you've reconciled with that scumbag.

437
00:21:57,810 --> 00:21:58,780
Then let's be friends.

438
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:01,560
I didn't have time to ask you out.

439

Let's talk about it today.

440

Let's go. Let's find

a comfortable place to talk.

442
00:22:06,790 --> 00:22:07,860
Don't be careless.

00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,770
Make it clear before you leave.

Longchen Fund?

You must have taken a fancy

to the commercial value of Tianjuan Old Village.

450
