1
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,319
You're Master Kitano.

2
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,240
Do you think I'm a fool?

3
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:20,960
Don't worry!

4
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:22,800
Look at this.

5
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:32,240
Luo Beichen.

6
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,599
I don't have time to joke with you.

7
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:47,800
true love

8
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:50,800
How could you...

9
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,840
This is the design I designed three days ago.

10
00:03:00,439 --> 00:03:02,039
For your birthday.

11
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:06,080
So you really...

12
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:08,800
Master Kitano asked me to give you a message.

13
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:10,240
he

14
00:03:11,719 --> 00:03:12,240
Likeyou

15
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:22,599
That's right.

16
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:23,879
What are you doing, honey?

17
00:03:24,039 --> 00:03:25,000
Looking for your gift.

18
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,400
It's okay, honey.

19
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,840
You don't need the gift.

20
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:28,800
In my heart.

21
00:03:29,439 --> 00:03:31,280
I've stepped on it better during the day.

22
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,280
And you'll fall in love with him.

23
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,199
The thief looks good.

24
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:34,000
come

25
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:40,280
I found it.

26
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:40,759
Hurry up.

27
00:03:44,039 --> 00:03:44,599
What?

28
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:45,919
Wild orchid

29
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,400
You're stealing flowers.

30
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,960
I'm the face of Ashe's company.

31
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,000
I took my company's stuff

32
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:54,560
It's not stealing.

33
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:57,800
This...

34
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,080
Is that okay, honey?

35
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,199
It's for you.

36
00:04:08,439 --> 00:04:09,120
Birthday present.

37
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,479
My wife married

38
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:17,160
It's worth it.

39
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,720
Thank you, wife.

40
00:04:19,879 --> 00:04:20,600
Who are you

41
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:21,519
What are you doing here?

42
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:24,240
five

43
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:26,240
four

44
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:27,839
three

45
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:30,079
two

46
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:31,959
one

47
00:05:39,879 --> 00:05:40,480
Okay, I got it.

48
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:42,920
Good morning, Miss Chen.

49
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:44,879
Good morning.

50
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:46,839
Peking University.

51
00:05:50,439 --> 00:05:51,319
I'm sorry.

52
00:05:51,959 --> 00:05:53,319
I still like to hear you calling me.

53
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:54,160
Luo Beichen.

54
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:55,959
Mr. Kitano,

55
00:05:56,279 --> 00:05:57,279
You're too kind.

56
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,079
You're such a big designer.

57
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,959
How dare I call you by your name?

58
00:06:01,399 --> 00:06:02,040
I dare not.

59
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,000
Xuan Yi.

60
00:06:07,079 --> 00:06:08,040
Do we have to do this?

61
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,000
Correct!

62
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,480
Mr. Kitano has an idea.

63
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,160
I want to discuss with you.

64
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:16,680
What about

65
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Okay, let's talk.

66
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,199
Let's go to your room.

67
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Go to his studio.

68
00:06:23,439 --> 00:06:24,160
Ten o'clock.

69
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:25,720
I haven't been there yet.

70
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:27,040
Visit

71
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:28,480
Okay, no problem.

72
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:29,920
I will tell Mr. Kitano

73
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:30,800
To prepare him.

74
00:06:31,519 --> 00:06:32,439
Remember to inform him.

75
00:06:32,439 --> 00:06:35,360
I like it clean and romantic.

76
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,959
And the blue monster.

77
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,079
understand

78
00:06:46,519 --> 00:06:47,160
It's beautifully polished.

79
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,000
Get off work.

80
00:06:49,079 --> 00:06:50,199
Really, Brother Chen?

81
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,680
I just went to work.

82
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,319
I told you to leave after work.

83
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:56,120
Brother Chen.

84
00:06:56,759 --> 00:06:57,920
I know I'm limited.

85
00:06:58,439 --> 00:06:59,480
But I will work hard.

86
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:00,720
You have two minutes.

87
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:01,800
Quickly disappear.

88
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:05,879
You still have one and a half minutes.

89
00:07:06,199 --> 00:07:07,199
Or I will deduct the salary.

90
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:17,879
What should I do?

91
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,759
I should have known I couldn't get up so early.

92
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:39,720
Where is she?

93
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:41,839
Where is Chen Xuan Yi?

94
00:07:44,079 --> 00:07:44,759
Sorry, President Luo.

95
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,639
President Chen can't come.

96
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:47,839
So she asked me to replace her.

97
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,480
You can take me as her.

98
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,319
Sorry

99
00:07:53,399 --> 00:07:54,439
I really can't do that.

100
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,279
Mr. Luo,

101
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,879
It's hard for me to do this.

102
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,120
Chen Xuanyi

103
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:01,560
you got me!

104
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:02,959
Make yourself at home.

105
00:08:11,959 --> 00:08:12,279
President Chen.

106
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:13,160
Mission accomplished.

107
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:14,480
It's going well.

108
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:30,959
Without this medal,

109
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,600
I almost thought it was a dream.

110
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:35,320
Ashe

111
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,679
The Star Network Project.

112
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:37,799
genius

113
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:39,480
Global Endorser

114
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,720
Life can be so wonderful.

115
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:54,919
wife

116
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:57,159
wife

117
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:02,480
Zhang Jingmei

118
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:19,639
What are you doing?

119
00:10:21,879 --> 00:10:22,720
It's early in the morning.

120
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:23,720
What are you doing?

121
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,440
Are you trying to steal my medals?

122
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:29,559
So ugly.

123
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,080
Who stole it?

124
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:34,879
Really

125
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,159
It's not you.

126
00:10:57,399 --> 00:10:58,919
What a rubbish!

127
00:10:58,919 --> 00:10:59,639
You wear it every day.

128
00:10:59,639 --> 00:11:00,600
If I want to, you're not afraid.

129
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:02,440
you

130
00:11:02,559 --> 00:11:03,240
Young master.

131
00:11:03,879 --> 00:11:04,440
Uncle Li.

132
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:05,879
Uncle Li.

133
00:11:06,559 --> 00:11:07,240
Miss Jingmei.

134
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,480
Master wants you to go to Long Hao Hotel.

135
00:11:11,679 --> 00:11:12,240
husband

136
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:15,120
What's wrong with Long Hao Hotel?

137
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:18,320
I don't want to take any more wealthy missions.

138
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,240
Maybe it's a good thing.

139
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:20,799
Don't be nervous.

140
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:21,919
Uncle Li.

141
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:25,519
Why are we going to Long Hao Hotel?

142
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:27,519
She said she would be in-laws.

143
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,039
go

144
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:33,679
Up, up.

145
00:11:35,159 --> 00:11:35,759
Up, up.

146
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:36,879
Hurry up.

147
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:37,559
To the left.

148
00:11:37,559 --> 00:11:39,240
You're always playing games during the holidays.

149
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:40,320
And didn't fold the quilt.

150
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:43,399
Clean your room.

151
00:11:43,399 --> 00:11:44,440
Clean your computer desk.

152
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:45,200
dang!

153
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,200
Are you stupid?

154
00:11:48,039 --> 00:11:48,799
What did you say

155
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:49,840
mom

156
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:50,879
My computer is stuck.

157
00:11:50,879 --> 00:11:51,679
I want to change the computer.

158
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:52,919
Change the computer.

159
00:11:52,919 --> 00:11:53,879
It's better to replace you.

160
00:11:54,159 --> 00:11:55,120
You don't do anything serious every day.

161
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:56,440
I only know how to spend money.

162
00:11:58,679 --> 00:11:59,399
stingy

163
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:04,799
wife

164
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:05,840
It's fixed.

165
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,240
Be accomplished

166
00:12:07,759 --> 00:12:08,120
dad

167
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:09,919
You're great.

168
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,120
I want to change a computer.

169
00:12:13,039 --> 00:12:14,159
It's fast.

170
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,639
Change your father first.

171
00:12:16,159 --> 00:12:16,600
dad

172
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,320
I did it for my career.

173
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:19,879
Others don't understand, you should.

174
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:21,559
This is professional e-sports.

175
00:12:21,559 --> 00:12:22,120
My career

176
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:23,039
The game is coming soon.

177
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:23,840
What?

178
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,159
I have no money.

179
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,320
Find your mom.

180
00:12:28,039 --> 00:12:29,320
Zhang Deshuai

181
00:12:29,639 --> 00:12:31,120
What a terrible mop!

182
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,200
I asked you to buy a new one the other day.

183
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,200
Not today.

184
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,240
Is there something good in this family?

185
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,879
I'm waiting for a promotion.

186
00:12:38,039 --> 00:12:39,000
I'll place an order now.

187
00:12:39,559 --> 00:12:40,200
I'm looking for my phone.

188
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:40,879
I'll place an order for you.

189
00:12:41,919 --> 00:12:42,879
Jingmei

190
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:44,519
It's great to have Jingmei.

191
00:12:45,559 --> 00:12:46,000
mom

192
00:12:49,679 --> 00:12:50,320
dad

193
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:52,120
Jing Mei.

194
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:52,919
You're back.

195
00:12:53,159 --> 00:12:53,600
dad and mom

196
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,360
I thought the Long family

197
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,399
It's not popular for daughters-in-law to go back to their parents.

198
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,799
Why are you here?

199
00:12:59,799 --> 00:13:00,320
mom

200
00:13:00,519 --> 00:13:02,600
Mom blamed me.

201
00:13:02,799 --> 00:13:04,519
I should have brought Jingmei back often.

202
00:13:05,559 --> 00:13:06,799
Just think about your daughter.

203
00:13:06,799 --> 00:13:07,840
Why bother?

204
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:11,480
Brother-in-law is here.

205
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:12,320
what?

206
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:14,480
Look at your mother-in-law.

207
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:21,759
dad and mom

208
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:22,159
Here's the thing.

209
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:23,240
This is

210
00:13:23,639 --> 00:13:25,039
In fact, today is dedicated to

211
00:13:25,039 --> 00:13:26,639
To invite you to Long Hao Hotel.

212
00:13:26,799 --> 00:13:28,679
My parents booked a banquet at Long Hao Hotel.

213
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,759
So that I can see you.

214
00:13:31,399 --> 00:13:32,200
then

215
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,799
To discuss the wedding between Jing Mei and me.

216
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:38,440
Zhang Dong Shuai

217
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:39,919
to make tea

218
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:41,480
to make tea

219
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:42,200
mom

220
00:13:42,519 --> 00:13:44,600
Listen, aren't you going out for dinner?

221
00:13:44,759 --> 00:13:45,720
Long Hao Hotel

222
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:46,399
What are you talking about?

223
00:13:47,039 --> 00:13:47,879
The son-in-law is a guest.

224
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:48,919
to make tea

225
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,399
To make tea.

226
00:14:12,039 --> 00:14:12,679
Who is this?

227
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,559
Could it be Miss Chen?

228
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:16,399
Sorry, Mr. Luo.

229
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:18,000
My assistant

230
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,600
It's too much.

231
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,120
It's okay.

232
00:14:20,519 --> 00:14:21,399
I'm fine.

233
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:24,759
But Master Kitano needs to calm down.

234
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,120
Master Kitano.

235
00:14:27,879 --> 00:14:29,080
Can I invite you

236
00:14:29,559 --> 00:14:32,159
Ride the Ferris wheel with me?

237
00:14:34,519 --> 00:14:35,320
To suppress with surprise

238
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:37,679
You lied to me for so long.

239
00:14:38,039 --> 00:14:39,399
Ride the Ferris wheel with me.

240
00:14:39,639 --> 00:14:40,799
Look at the environment of the park.

241
00:14:41,399 --> 00:14:42,559
Just pretend we're even.

242
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:45,720
President Chen, you are right.

243
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,720
You even forgot to work.

244
00:14:48,759 --> 00:14:49,080
please

245
00:14:50,279 --> 00:14:50,759
please

246
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:08,960
dad and mom

247
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:10,360
Little One's parents

248
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:12,240
Is waiting for us in the restaurant.

249
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,320
Waiting for you.

250
00:15:13,799 --> 00:15:14,879
Don't worry.

251
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,200
Don't worry.

252
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:19,120
Yes

253
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,720
You shouldn't be anxious.

254
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,000
We've been waiting for so long.

255
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,120
It's time for them to wait.

256
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:28,600
I've made a deal.

257
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:31,200
It's not my Jingmei who overrides you.

258
00:15:31,399 --> 00:15:34,120
You want to marry Jing Mei.

259
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,279
Is that right?

260
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:37,080
That's right.

261
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,600
I'm young and I know a lot.

262
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:39,519
It's not considered.

263
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:40,320
You didn't handle it well.

264
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:41,120
That's right.

265
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:43,360
My parents specially

266
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,080
Let me apologize to you.

267
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:46,639
Here comes the tea.

268
00:15:53,039 --> 00:15:53,519
mom

269
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,120
This mop is so old.

270
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:55,919
Why don't you get a new one?

271
00:15:55,919 --> 00:15:57,039
I'll buy you a new one.

272
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,159
What are you buying?

273
00:15:58,600 --> 00:15:59,000
I'll do it.

274
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:02,159
What mop?

275
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:03,440
Parents, don't worry.

276
00:16:03,799 --> 00:16:05,360
I'll take care of everything in this house.

277
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:07,600
If you want to get a new house,

278
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,120
It's fine too

279
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:09,200
We don't need anything.

280
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:10,799
We need his attitude.

281
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:14,519
Let's go.

282
00:16:14,919 --> 00:16:16,120
My in-laws are waiting for dinner.

283
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,120
Xuan Yi.

284
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:19,039
Your industrial park is big.

285
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:20,600
You even took the playground.

286
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,440
We're going to create

287
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:24,080
A city game called Omey Box.

288
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:25,360
In short,

289
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,720
Is to make the escape chamber into the city.

290
00:16:28,039 --> 00:16:28,559
This park

291
00:16:28,559 --> 00:16:29,960
Is one of our game boxes.

292
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:30,919
So cool.

293
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:34,720
come

294
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:43,919
Close your eyes.

295
00:16:45,919 --> 00:16:46,360
Why?

296
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:52,840
I have a gift for you.

297
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:13,200
Are you ready?

298
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:15,839
Xuan Yi.

299
00:17:19,759 --> 00:17:20,240
Chen Xuanyi

300
00:17:20,599 --> 00:17:21,559
Chen Xuan Yi, what are you doing?

301
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:22,440
Chen Xuanyi

302
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:34,279
Chen Xuanyi

303
00:17:34,599 --> 00:17:35,319
What are you doing?

304
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:36,319
Luo Beichen.

305
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,000
We just acquired this park.

306
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,640
The equipment is newly inspected.

307
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:42,039
Absolutely safe.

308
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:44,759
Didn't you agree

309
00:17:44,759 --> 00:17:46,599
Is it even if we ride the Ferris wheel together?

310
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,039
You tricked me again.

311
00:17:50,119 --> 00:17:51,400
The blind box opposite

312
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,200
Is our newly designed game product.

313
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:55,480
You can summon the Dragon Master.

314
00:17:56,079 --> 00:17:57,720
But I don't know what's in there.

315
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,759
If you find the bad handsome,

316
00:18:01,319 --> 00:18:03,079
I can grant you any request.

317
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:05,880
Any request.

318
00:18:06,599 --> 00:18:07,319
to mean what one says

319
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:09,960
Of course.

320
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:11,880
However

321
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:13,680
You have to do me a little favor.

322
00:18:14,319 --> 00:18:15,160
What are you talking about?

323
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:17,920
The Ferris wheel

324
00:18:18,079 --> 00:18:19,599
The turn is 20 minutes.

325
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,039
I'm at the top.

326
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:23,079
Set a two-hour stay for you.

327
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:24,839
There's a pen and paper under the seat.

328
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,960
Then let Master Kitano

329
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,319
To design a set of

330
00:18:28,319 --> 00:18:30,759
Game levels and theme toys.

331
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:34,599
Xuan Yi.

332
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:36,640
I'm afraid of heights.

333
00:18:37,079 --> 00:18:38,160
you and I

334
00:18:38,359 --> 00:18:39,039
I can't.

335
00:18:39,319 --> 00:18:40,240
I'm really afraid of heights.

336
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:40,759
I'm going to vomit.

337
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:42,240
No way

338
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:42,920
I'm going to vomit.

339
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:43,720
Really?

340
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:44,640
That's great.

341
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,839
It can inspire you.

342
00:18:48,359 --> 00:18:48,680
Xuan

343
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:50,160
Stop acting.

344
00:18:50,359 --> 00:18:51,440
Although our equipment is safe,

345
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:52,720
But let me remind you,

346
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:55,039
You'd better lock the door inside.

347
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:56,279
dang!

348

uncle

But this is too...

Dad said it.

433
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:57,440
A family doesn't speak two languages.

434
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:59,240
Just listen to me.

435
00:22:00,279 --> 00:22:01,240
