1
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,639
Boss, you're here.

2
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,759
Mr. Chen,

3
00:02:59,280 --> 00:02:59,960
where's Luo Beichen?

4
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,039
He should be on his way.

5
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,120
He'll be here soon.

6
00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:07,280
Oh.

7
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:12,840
Master Kitano's daily attire is very abstract,

8
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:14,479
why are you here?

9
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:15,919
To apply for a job?

10
00:03:16,919 --> 00:03:19,599
Is your studio hiring someone?

11
00:03:20,919 --> 00:03:22,759
Yes, I will.

12
00:03:23,439 --> 00:03:26,360
But Longchen Fund

13
00:03:27,159 --> 00:03:27,759
resigned.

14
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:29,520
To be precise,

15
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:31,000
everything about Chen's Group,

16
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:31,639
I've retired,

17
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,840
so I came to your studio to apply for the job.

18
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,759
Quit your job and come to me,

19
00:03:40,199 --> 00:03:40,560
Grandpa.

20
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,039
I'm going to quit my job

21
00:03:42,039 --> 00:03:43,719
as the general manager of Longchen Fund

22
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:46,479
and I won't be directly involved in

23
00:03:46,719 --> 00:03:47,879
the work of Long Family and Chen Family anymore.

24
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:49,280
Xuanyi,

25
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,759
have you really made up your mind?

26
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:52,759
Yes.

27
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,719
I think during my time

28
00:03:54,719 --> 00:03:56,120
working at Longchen Fund,

29
00:03:56,199 --> 00:03:56,960
I've gained a lot.

30
00:03:57,479 --> 00:03:58,639
And I've never regretted it.

31
00:03:59,319 --> 00:04:01,759
But I want to do something for myself in the future.

32
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:04,120
It's good that you've made up your mind.

33
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,719
We, Xuanyi,

34
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,800
will succeed in everything we do.

35
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:10,520
Grandpa,

36
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,719
thank you for the dowry.

37
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,120
To me, Aixuan City

38
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:14,919
is really important.

39
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:17,639
Aixuan City,

40
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:19,639
not the dowry grandpa gave you,

41
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:21,480
In Aixuan City,

42
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:24,199
Luo Beichen used all his wealth,

43
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,120
I exchanged it with your uncle.

44
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,240
Give me a glass of water.

45
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:39,319
What position is Mr. Chen going to apply for?

46
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,319
General Manager of Kitano Design Studio,

47
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,439
Mr. Chen, have a drink,

48
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,120
Thank you.

49
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:48,920
You sound so loud.

50
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,160
Mr. Chen, who dominates the business world,

51
00:04:53,839 --> 00:04:55,439
actually came to my small studio.

52
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,079
Don't you think it's Qu Cai?

53
00:04:58,959 --> 00:05:00,199
Now I'm in full charge of

54
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:01,680
all the affairs of Kitano Studio,

55
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:03,240
One month later,

56
00:05:03,439 --> 00:05:04,600
a joint-stock company will be registered,

57
00:05:04,879 --> 00:05:05,639
Three years later,

58
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:06,560
we'll start our world tour.

59
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:07,680
Five years later,

60
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,720
I bought a Wenchuang building in the square,

61
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,199
Master Kitano,

62
00:05:12,279 --> 00:05:14,360
your free time is over.

63
00:05:17,879 --> 00:05:18,360
Boss,

64
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:19,920
you're squeezing employees.

65
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:21,920
Master Kitano's talent

66
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,240
deserves to be appreciated by the whole world.

67
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:25,800
You even drew cakes for me.

68
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,160
Do you want to

69
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:29,800
eat this cake?

70
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:30,959
Eat it.

71
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:33,639
Of course. It's

72
00:05:34,519 --> 00:05:35,279
delicious.

73
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:47,839
Mr. Zhang, wait a minute.

74
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,120
What are you doing?

75
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:50,800
We don't know either. Mr. Long

76
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:51,560
asked me

77
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:02,079
to be late for the move. Mr. Zhang.

78
00:06:04,439 --> 00:06:05,639
What are you doing?

79
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:06,560
When I go to work,

80
00:06:07,439 --> 00:06:09,639
I still have half of the company's shares.

81
00:06:11,879 --> 00:06:13,319
Does Mr. Zhang know?

82
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:14,600
Well,

83
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:19,000
do it yourself and have enough food and clothing.

84
00:06:21,639 --> 00:06:22,319
Mr. Zhang.

85
00:06:26,439 --> 00:06:29,319
Reimbursement of this invoice.

86
00:06:40,879 --> 00:06:42,560
Invoices can be reimbursed.

87
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,279
If you go to work,

88
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,920
Mr. Long, please make these publicity plans

89
00:06:47,959 --> 00:06:50,120
into a PowerPoint. By the way,

90
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:53,040
it should be illustrated with pictures and texts.

91
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,160
No, no, no.

92
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:57,439
Come on!

93
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,120
Zhang Jingmei.

94
00:07:04,839 --> 00:07:05,399
Jialin,

95
00:07:08,279 --> 00:07:09,680
you come here every day,

96
00:07:09,879 --> 00:07:10,759
Those who don't know will think that

97
00:07:10,759 --> 00:07:12,360
our tea shop has closed down?

98
00:07:13,279 --> 00:07:14,879
Zhang Dong Shuai and the others are here anyway.

99
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,079
I have nothing else to do in the past.

100
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:16,959
Besides,

101
00:07:17,279 --> 00:07:18,360
Jingmei's company has just started,

102
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,079
so I have to come here to warm up the house.

103
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,120
Smells good,

104
00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:24,040
Jingmei,

105
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,560
come and eat.

106
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:26,720
You're here.

107
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:31,839
Let me see.

108
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,279
What delicacy did you bring?

109
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:35,480
Take a look.

110
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:45,480
Wait,

111
00:07:47,079 --> 00:07:48,079
are you two

112
00:07:48,199 --> 00:07:49,199
hiding something from me?

113
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:49,800
No

114
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,759
You answered so decisively.

115
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:58,560
Who gave it to you?

116
00:07:59,199 --> 00:07:59,600
Jingmei,

117
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:00,959
did you have a friend here?

118
00:08:02,079 --> 00:08:03,240
Did you tell me?

119
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,759
Is it Long Yi?

120
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:14,800
Can you two stop gossiping?

121
00:08:15,279 --> 00:08:17,120
He and I are just working,

122
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:17,800
that's all.

123
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:18,680
Eating

124
00:08:21,319 --> 00:08:22,800
and working.

125
00:08:25,959 --> 00:08:27,120
I inserted it.

126
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:28,839
Speak slowly.

127
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:30,600
Insert,

128
00:08:31,519 --> 00:08:32,279
insert a picture,

129
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,440
No, I still don't have one.

130
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,200
If I had told you earlier,

131
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:40,320
wouldn't you have just changed the background?

132
00:08:40,639 --> 00:08:41,159
Nonsense,

133
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:42,600
Brother,

134
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:44,159
I might as well do it for you.

135
00:08:44,519 --> 00:08:45,240
You've called 20 times

136
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,480
in the last ten minutes.

137
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:48,600
I gotta go. Bye.

138
00:08:52,039 --> 00:08:53,480
Replace,

139
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,159
Yes,

140
00:08:59,120 --> 00:08:59,799
That's right.

141
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:04,759
Why is it gone again?

142
00:09:12,039 --> 00:09:12,840
Go to my office.

143
00:09:13,039 --> 00:09:13,399
Okay,

144
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:14,519
Xinyi

145
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:16,080
-Throw this away. -Thank you. Okay. Let's arrange the

146
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,279
rest of the work.

147
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:20,879
Okay.

148
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:27,879
What do you think?

149
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,600
Is Mr. Long okay?

150
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,720
Did you make all these yourself?

151
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,720
Of course. It only

152
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,039
took you two hours

153
00:09:39,399 --> 00:09:40,799
to figure it out yourself.

154
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,840
Don't get so close to me,

155
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,720
I can't work anymore.

156
00:09:58,960 --> 00:09:59,960
You do your job.

157
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:01,399
How else can I supervise you?

158
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:03,759
I'm the producer.

159
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:05,960
Turn the page.

160
00:10:06,559 --> 00:10:07,559
Just pretend I don't exist.

161
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:23,080
Did your wife miss me?

162
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:46,960
Jingmei always talks to him.

163
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,279
Go on, go on, go on.

164
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:52,960
Jialin.

165
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,240
I'll supervise you later.

166
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,200
I'm finally done.

167
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:42,320
Long Yi.

168
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,919
Long Yi, is that you?

169
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:58,879
You're off work so late.

170
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,159
You must be exhausted.

171
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:03,480
Who are you?

172
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:04,840
I'm Long Yi.

173
00:12:05,879 --> 00:12:06,679
I'm waiting for you to get off work.

174
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:11,639
Honey,

175
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,120
why did you hit me?

176
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:14,519
You mistook me for someone else.

177
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:20,279
I … I know I was wrong.

178
00:12:22,279 --> 00:12:23,639
I know you did everything for my own good.

179
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:25,759
I've read all your comics.

180
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:30,000
No one will separate us anymore.

181
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:32,519
I'll always be your Long Yi.

182
00:12:34,279 --> 00:12:35,000
Don't come near me.

183
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:36,159
I don't know you.

184
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:37,360
Honey,

185
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:39,639
let's go home.

186
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:44,679
Honey,

187
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,320
you can't run away.

188
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:48,440
Honey,

189
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:49,840
Honey,

190
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,399
The most important thing about driverless technology

191
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,480
is not just autonomous driving technology,

192
00:12:56,039 --> 00:12:58,519
And GPS signal and battery stability.

193
00:13:00,679 --> 00:13:01,200
What about today?

194
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,840
Let me share with you a little bit.

195
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,720
This new battery from our company

196
00:13:06,159 --> 00:13:08,960
has the highest stability in the market.

197
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,879
And it's very cost-effective.

198
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:11,799
Don't come near me.

199
00:13:11,799 --> 00:13:12,559
Don't come near me.

200
00:13:12,559 --> 00:13:14,240
Calm down, okay? Okay,

201
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,679
okay. I'm calm. I'm calm.

202
00:13:16,279 --> 00:13:17,200
You can do whatever you want.

203
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:18,360
You can do whatever you want.

204
00:13:18,919 --> 00:13:19,960
I will never make you sad again.

205
00:13:20,039 --> 00:13:20,320
Okay?

206
00:13:22,919 --> 00:13:23,919
Brother, are you really...

207
00:13:23,919 --> 00:13:24,279
Brother,

208
00:13:24,919 --> 00:13:26,000
I'm your husband.

209
00:13:26,279 --> 00:13:27,679
Do you know that you want to call me husband?

210
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:28,399
Okay,

211
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,519
Tell my husband to hurry up.

212
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:31,080
You really … You really … Don't do this again.

213
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,440
I'm really going to hurt you.

214
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:33,879
Please hurt me, okay?

215
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:34,399
Yes.

216
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:35,120
Hurry up and hurt me.

217
00:13:37,159 --> 00:13:37,919
The location is easy to find.

218
00:13:38,279 --> 00:13:38,919
It's around here.

219
00:13:43,159 --> 00:13:43,679
Are you okay?

220
00:13:50,679 --> 00:13:51,600
Long Yi, right?

221
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:56,559
-Let's talk. -Who

222
00:13:59,159 --> 00:13:59,720
are you?

223
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:01,720
Watch out!

224
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:03,840
Wife, who is he?

225
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:06,720
Long Yi,

226
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:09,559
I guess,

227
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,279
You should still be in love with Zhang Jingmei.

228
00:14:14,159 --> 00:14:15,159
It has never changed.

229
00:14:15,759 --> 00:14:16,240
That's right.

230
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:21,039
Do you know why you love Zhang Jingmei so much?

231
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:25,200
Because she can make you a better person.

232
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:26,960
It's her.

233
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:29,399
It taught you to be down-to-earth.

234
00:14:30,559 --> 00:14:31,519
It's her.

235
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,399
Let you know who you are.

236
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:34,799
It's her, too.

237
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,200
I told you not to live for others.

238
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:40,720
Long Yi,

239
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,399
open your eyes and look around you,

240
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,559
All of your career,

241
00:14:45,559 --> 00:14:47,120
was given by the Long family,

242
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:50,480
But the one who made you spread your wings,

243
00:14:51,919 --> 00:14:52,879
was Zhang Jingmei.

244
00:14:55,919 --> 00:14:56,720
Who are you?

245
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:58,120
Who on earth are you?

246
00:14:59,919 --> 00:15:00,279
Who is it?

247
00:15:00,279 --> 00:15:01,080
What are you doing? This is

248
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:01,960
… I'm Long Yi.

249
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,279
Do you know who I am?

250
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:03,879
I'm Long Yi.

251
00:15:03,879 --> 00:15:04,799
He pretended to be me,

252
00:15:05,159 --> 00:15:06,639
He pretended that I'm Long Yi,

253
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:07,759
I'm Long Yi,

254
00:15:07,759 --> 00:15:08,720
He pretended that

255
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:09,559
you caught the wrong person.

256
00:15:09,559 --> 00:15:09,879
Get in the car.

257
00:15:09,879 --> 00:15:10,919
You should arrest him.

258
00:15:11,799 --> 00:15:13,080
Long Yi,

259
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,000
I really made a mistake.

260
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,200
Get in the car!

261
00:15:15,799 --> 00:15:16,679
I got it wrong.

262
00:15:34,159 --> 00:15:34,919
Mrs. Long,

263
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,399
your Mr. Long is a bit stupid,

264
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,039
I grew up a little late.

265
00:15:40,279 --> 00:15:41,639
You're willing to give him a chance.

266
00:15:42,679 --> 00:15:43,679
Forgive him again?

267
00:15:48,759 --> 00:15:49,480
Do you still remember?

268
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,000
I haven't said the third condition yet.

269
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,919
Remember when I told you,

270
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:00,919
I can say no to you?

271
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:05,799
I'm going to marry you soon.

272
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:07,399
I can't wait.

273
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:09,840
Now.

274
00:16:26,679 --> 00:16:27,200
Hey,

275
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,720
What are you doing

276
00:16:30,799 --> 00:16:31,679
in the middle of the night?

277
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:36,840
What?

278
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:40,960
Here we are at Longmei Island.

279
00:16:53,039 --> 00:16:53,559
Hey,

280
00:16:54,159 --> 00:16:54,840
Why am I in such a hurry

281
00:16:55,159 --> 00:16:55,759
to get married today?

282
00:16:56,759 --> 00:16:57,399
Okay, I'll be right there.

283
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:16,319
Sorry,

284
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:18,000
I have something urgent to deal with.

285
00:17:18,039 --> 00:17:19,960
Let's postpone our appointment.

286
00:17:20,279 --> 00:17:22,400
I'll tell you the exact time later.

287
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:24,000
Hello, Uncle,

288
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:25,279
That's right.

289
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:27,559
The wedding of Xiaoyi and Jingmei has been advanced.

290
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:30,200
Yes, yes, in Longmei Island,

291
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:30,799
Okay,

292
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,200
See you then.

293
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:33,319
Okay, okay.

294
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:38,559
I only slept for a minute.

295
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:39,319
Wake up.

296
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:40,960
You won't be able to make it to your sister's wedding if it's too late.

297
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:41,839
Hurry up.

298
00:17:42,079 --> 00:17:43,359
This kid is really...

299
00:17:44,599 --> 00:17:45,640
Hurry up!

300
00:18:10,359 --> 00:18:11,079
Don't be nervous.

301
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,160
Don't neglect anything.

302
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:18,240
Stop filming.

303
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:25,279
Why are you nervous?

304
00:18:26,119 --> 00:18:27,599
It's Zhang Jingmei, not anyone else.

305
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:30,880
Relax. Relax.

306
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:34,279
Once born and twice cooked,

307
00:18:35,359 --> 00:18:36,519
you are married for the second time,

308
00:18:38,359 --> 00:18:39,200
Take it easy,

I'm so touched.

313
00:18:51,079 --> 00:18:52,079
All right. What should we do?

314
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:52,640
All right.

315
00:18:57,119 --> 00:18:57,599
No,

316
00:18:57,759 --> 00:18:58,680
no, no, no.

317
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:00,200
We're a family now.

318
00:19:00,319 --> 00:19:01,160
Don't push me.

319
00:19:01,319 --> 00:19:02,559
-This way. -How can I?

320
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,359
Hello, in-laws,

321
00:19:06,519 --> 00:19:08,000

Come on! Jump on the roof! Jump on the roof!

328
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:16,039
There are enemies up there!

329
00:19:16,359 --> 00:19:17,039
I can't.

330
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:22,920
Okay,

I think your skin is good.

334
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,200
I'll give my daughter to you today.

335
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:49,920
If you lose it again,

336
00:20:50,359 --> 00:20:51,599
I won't look for it anymore.

337
00:20:53,559 --> 00:20:54,400
Don't worry,

338

00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:41,559
Happiness,

346
00:21:41,559 --> 00:21:41,920
In-laws.

00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:42,599
Congratulations.

348
00:21:42,599 --> 00:21:43,079
We share the same joy.

349
00:21:43,079 --> 00:21:44,160
This is perfect.

350
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:45,799
Mr. Long,

351
00:21:46,319 --> 00:21:47,319
hello.

352
00:21:47,319 --> 00:21:49,039
Congratulations.

353
00:21:51,759 --> 00:21:52,440
Long Yi,

354
00:21:52,839 --> 00:21:54,720
I'm stubborn and inflexible,

355
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,160
Think about it carefully.

356
00:21:57,559 --> 00:21:58,200
Zhang Jingmei,

357
00:21:58,759 --> 00:22:00,279
just tell me if you can't live without me.

358
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:01,319
Don't be stubborn,

359
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,319
I don't know who went to the Civil Affairs Bureau last time,

360
00:22:04,319 --> 00:22:05,640
I got my mom's marriage certificate.

361
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:25,200
Your name is Zhen Meili.

362
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:28,880
Well,

363
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:31,359
I might have taken it by mistake.

364
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:37,400
You make it sound like someone

365
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,839
is holding his ID card.

366
00:22:43,599 --> 00:22:44,599
In 1950.

367
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:49,519
I took it wrong.

368
00:22:50,079 --> 00:22:50,759
I'm sorry.

369
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:57,160
If you admit it, I'll admit it.

370
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:58,319
It's impossible.

371
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,200
If you want to admit it, you admit it first,

372
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,200
but I won't admit it anyway.

373
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:11,119
Just admit it.

374
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:12,880
I just love you.

375
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:13,880
I just can't live without you.

376
00:23:14,079 --> 00:23:14,599
What's wrong?

377
00:24:15,119 --> 00:24:16,279
Slow down.

378
00:24:17,079 --> 00:24:17,759
Don't fall.

379
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:20,480
This guy,

380
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,400
my brother-in-law bullied me again,

381
00:24:23,119 --> 00:24:24,039
With a dirty face,

382
00:24:24,359 --> 00:24:24,920
why did Yiyi

383
00:24:27,079 --> 00:24:28,400
bully my uncle again?

384
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:29,759
I've told you many times,

385
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:30,640
don't bully uncle.

386
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:31,480
Apologize to uncle.

387
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:32,400
Zhang Mingshuai,

388
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:33,440
stand here.

389
00:24:36,319 --> 00:24:36,599
Well,

390
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,079
You can't do this.

391
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:40,720
You even bullied my brother-in-law.

392
00:24:42,279 --> 00:24:43,400
Slow down.

393
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,160
Long Yiyi,

394
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:46,680
slow down. Kid,
