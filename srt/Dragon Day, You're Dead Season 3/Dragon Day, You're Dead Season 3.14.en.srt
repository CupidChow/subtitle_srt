1
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,439
What does the public relations team say now?

2
00:02:32,759 --> 00:02:34,680
The heat must be reduced to a minimum.

3
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:36,159
The impact must be reduced to a minimum.

4
00:02:36,159 --> 00:02:36,800
Do you know?

5
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:37,360
President Long.

6
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,439
That's all for today.

7
00:02:38,919 --> 00:02:40,879
And buy you time.

8
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,319
With this time,

9
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,680
You can still fight for Master Bai.

10
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:49,000
We have Swiss and Australian industries

11
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,680
Long Chen Foundation will definitely

12
00:02:51,439 --> 00:02:52,199
I really...

13
00:02:52,199 --> 00:02:52,960
From two o'clock to now,

14
00:02:53,159 --> 00:02:53,840
I still have a meeting.

15
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:54,800
I really have to go.

16
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,520
The Long family has to rush in.

17
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:57,400
It has nothing to do with me.

18
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:57,960
You can't play.

19
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:58,360
yes

20
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,520
It's the same as young people.

21
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,919
Without Bai's participation,

22
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,840
How can we fight with Nian Shiyu?

23
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,120
We can't take the risk.

24
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:23,759
Don't be nervous.

25
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:25,319
I'm not here to cause trouble.

26
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,319
Everyone is waiting for Uncle Bai.

27
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:31,159
What the hell is going on?

28
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:32,280
I invited her.

29
00:03:33,719 --> 00:03:34,240
Uncle Bai.

30
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:36,439
Please.

31
00:03:37,039 --> 00:03:38,080
Old Master Bai,

32
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:38,639
Old Master Bai,

33
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:39,400
Father Bai, sit down.

34
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:40,280
good

35
00:03:40,759 --> 00:03:41,360
Have a seat.

36
00:03:42,439 --> 00:03:43,520
What are you waiting for?

37
00:03:45,319 --> 00:03:46,479
Invite me to have a seat.

38
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:48,360
come

39
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:54,400
please

40
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,479
Congratulations

41
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:17,319
come

42
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,600
Vaulting horse

43
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,639
Fierce

44
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,399
general

45
00:04:39,959 --> 00:04:41,079
Hey, you old boss.

46
00:04:41,079 --> 00:04:42,199
Aren't you confused?

47
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:44,519
Why do you remember it so clearly?

48
00:04:45,639 --> 00:04:47,040
You're such a bad chess player.

49
00:04:47,399 --> 00:04:48,600
I'll give you another 30 years.

50
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:51,120
You can't defeat me.

51
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:52,879
No more.

52
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,079
How could you?

53
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,040
You haven't changed your tactics for 30 years.

54
00:04:56,839 --> 00:04:58,360
In front of the child.

55
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,720
Aren't you ashamed?

56
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:00,879
Shi Lan.

57
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,040
Play chess for me.

58
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,079
I'll do it.

59
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:04,399
Grandpa and Grandpa.

60
00:05:05,319 --> 00:05:07,120
You two are really good at chess.

61
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,199
Immortal.

62
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:09,959
My eyes are blurred.

63
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:11,079
Naughty boy.

64
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:12,040
You're so sweet.

65
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,160
Is there something else?

66
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:13,879
grandpa

67
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:17,639
Didn't you just set up the foundation?

68
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:18,199
I

69
00:05:18,439 --> 00:05:19,879
My wedding with Jing Mei

70
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:22,600
Why don't you arrange it?

71
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:23,560
It's more than happy.

72
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:25,639
Naughty boy.

73
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:28,160
You want to take my daughter away?

74
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,079
Shi Lan.

75
00:05:29,879 --> 00:05:30,959
Don't talk to him.

76
00:05:33,079 --> 00:05:33,720
Grandpa

77
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,199
I'm your own grandson.

78
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:37,040
You can't prevent me from being a thief.

79
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,439
You're a kid.

80
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:39,759
Don't think I didn't know.

81
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:41,240
What are you talking about?

82
00:05:41,439 --> 00:05:42,920
You can't handle the outside affairs well.

83
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,399
Don't think about Shi Lan.

84
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:45,439
Do you hear me?

85
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,560
Grandpa, aren't you confused?

86
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,480
Why do you remember it so clearly?

87
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:52,519
nonsense

88
00:05:53,079 --> 00:05:55,399
Don't think you coaxed Shi Lan.

89
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:57,160
I fell into the trap.

90
00:05:59,160 --> 00:05:59,639
grandpa

91
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,360
Is my dad really like this?

92
00:06:03,639 --> 00:06:04,600
Your father

93
00:06:04,759 --> 00:06:05,959
There are no other advantages.

94
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,879
It means love and justice.

95
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:11,800
Your mother always said he was like Guo Jing.

96
00:06:12,519 --> 00:06:13,279
Who is Guo Jing?

97
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,360
The famous Grand Master Guo doesn't even know it.

98
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:19,839
Your mother said she was like a zither.

99
00:06:21,279 --> 00:06:22,160
Chinese zither.

100
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,519
Prepare for the wedding.

101
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:26,920
Really, Grandpa.

102
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,639
Why not?

103
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:28,879
do

104
00:06:28,879 --> 00:06:29,240
Then forget it.

105
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,079
Do it.

106
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:31,839
A word can never be withdrawn

107
00:06:31,879 --> 00:06:32,680
Grandpa, it's a deal.

108
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:33,759
It's settled.

109
00:06:33,959 --> 00:06:34,480
Master

110
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:37,759
Aranoush's phone.

111
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:40,879
From Kolstein.

112
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:41,279
yes

113
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:44,279
feed

114
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:45,199
Hello, Mr. Long.

115
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:46,199
I'm Aranoush.

116
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:52,560
husband

117
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
From now on, every month,

118
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,360
Take a few more days to visit Grandpa.

119
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,040
Auntie, they are abroad.

120
00:06:58,439 --> 00:06:59,920
My uncle is often away from home.

121
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:00,720
no problem

122
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,480
Mrs. Long.

123
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,000
If you eat like this,

124
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,319
I'm not afraid that I can't pass the title of Miss Mo tomorrow.

125
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:14,519
It's all your fault.

126
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,720
When can we move out?

127
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:19,000
I'm thinking about Miss Mo.

128
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,319
I have nightmares.

129
00:07:20,839 --> 00:07:21,759
A wedding?

130
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:23,519
After the wedding, he left with a proper name.

131
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:27,439
Trying to trick me again.

132
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,560
What kind of routine?

133
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:33,079
You can taste it.

134
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,600
as if

135
00:07:39,879 --> 00:07:41,199
That's right.

136
00:07:47,439 --> 00:07:48,079
wife

137
00:07:50,079 --> 00:07:54,040
Here's something you can't imagine.

138
00:08:04,839 --> 00:08:06,040
When I got the license,

139
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,639
Some people are like this.

140
00:08:07,639 --> 00:08:10,120
He pulled out his household register all of a sudden.

141
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:10,839
Shh

142
00:08:11,399 --> 00:08:11,920
Look.

143
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,240
These are three alternative wedding scenes.

144
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,560
I've seen the first two.

145
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:19,519
This is Long Mei Island.

146
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,079
Long Mei Island.

147
00:08:22,279 --> 00:08:23,600
Grandpa gave me a birthday gift.

148
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,000
It's Long Yi Island.

149
00:08:27,439 --> 00:08:29,199
It's so uncreative.

150
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,759
What?

151
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:32,639
It's what it is.

152
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,080
My grandfather gave me the island.

153
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,399
It's not Long Yi Dao.

154
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:36,480
And called Zhang Jingmei Island.

155
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:43,799
How about Zhang Jingmei Island?

156
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,480
I won't.

157
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,240
You are all mine.

158
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,720
The island doesn't have to call my name.

159
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:50,799
My wife is right.

160
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,320
If so,

161
00:08:57,559 --> 00:08:59,360
We have to finish it well.

162
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,679
The reception task our grandfather gave us.

163
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:04,200
What are you doing?

164
00:09:04,879 --> 00:09:05,840
To check the information.

165
00:09:06,039 --> 00:09:07,919
Grandpa said that Ash is very important.

166
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,039
Ashe

167
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,600
Aranush

168
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,600
The VIP from Kolstein.

169
00:09:15,919 --> 00:09:17,200
Seriously, honey?

170
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,639
It's a big night.

171
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:20,960
You should start to aim high.

172
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:24,519
To complete the task assigned to us by Grandpa,

173
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,480
You must be prepared for it.

174
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,600
The exam he gave us

175
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:29,320
you

176
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:31,840
Not Madam Long.

177
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,720
You're too learned.

178
00:09:37,919 --> 00:09:38,720
Grandpa said

179
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:41,759
Aranoush is a mall elite.

180
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,000
There's no information about him online.

181
00:09:45,559 --> 00:09:46,720
The veteran is his brother.

182
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,600
He's only responsible for the development of dark technology.

183
00:09:49,399 --> 00:09:50,480
Don't interfere with the market.

184
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,399
There's not even a photo.

185
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:55,799
Have you seen him?

186
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,080
People like them

187
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,840
I only care about privacy.

188
00:10:02,039 --> 00:10:03,039
They always think

189
00:10:03,039 --> 00:10:04,159
As if someone wanted to hurt them.

190
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:07,960
Really?

191
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
What are you thinking about?

192
00:10:13,159 --> 00:10:15,399
He's a perfect student and a genius.

193
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,600
With dreams and concentration.

194
00:10:18,559 --> 00:10:20,039
The God of Men.

195
00:10:22,279 --> 00:10:23,919
I'm telling you,

196
00:10:23,919 --> 00:10:24,480
Zhang Jingmei

197
00:10:25,879 --> 00:10:26,919
I've never seen him.

198
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,679
Have I seen his brother?

199
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,320
65.

200
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,120
So what?

201
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,120
So what?

202
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:38,559
A man who focuses is the most handsome.

203
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,200
I'll give you one more chance.

204
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:45,120
Say it again.

205
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,120
My husband is the most handsome.

206
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:57,360
feed

207
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,840
Come out.

208
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,039
We'll be there soon.

209
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:02,639
Who is it?

210
00:11:03,919 --> 00:11:04,879
A brother.

211
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,639
A brother.

212
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,399
Hi, Xuan Yi.

213
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:15,799
hi

214
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,120
This is for you.

215
00:11:17,559 --> 00:11:18,279
What is it?

216
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:22,639
I heard you're hosting Kolstein's guests.

217
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,360
I think you can use it.

218
00:11:26,679 --> 00:11:27,879
It's too expensive.

219
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:29,679
I don't like to owe people favors.

220
00:11:30,039 --> 00:11:30,440
Also

221
00:11:30,639 --> 00:11:31,600
Thank you for the flower cakes.

222
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,159
Thank you for letting me know.

223
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:34,919
There's more than one way to solve the problem.

224
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,000
to make sense

225
00:11:36,879 --> 00:11:37,720
I won't stand on ceremony.

226
00:11:38,679 --> 00:11:39,240
I have something to do.

227
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:39,879
Let's go.

228
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:40,720
bye-bye

229
00:11:40,879 --> 00:11:41,440
bye-bye

230
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:48,480
You two think I don't exist?

231
00:11:48,759 --> 00:11:49,639
Bye, brother.

232
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:05,879
Not a wife.

233
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:09,679
When did you add the WeChat?

234
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,440
It's none of your business.

235
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:24,919
Miss Jingmei.

236
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,480
Think about it carefully.

237
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:27,639
he

238
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,960
But a representative of the Renaissance.

239
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,639
Miss Mo.

240
00:12:34,759 --> 00:12:37,600
Can I apply for breakfast first?

241
00:12:38,039 --> 00:12:39,000
may not

242
00:12:39,639 --> 00:12:42,120
You should figure out the Renaissance first.

243
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,480
But the Renaissance

244
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:45,799
It's been more than 500 years.

245
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,960
Miss Mo.

246
00:12:50,919 --> 00:12:51,480
aunt

247
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:52,519
Mrs. Long. Young master.

248
00:12:52,879 --> 00:12:53,559
Miss Mo.

249
00:12:54,159 --> 00:12:55,320
Please stop for a while.

250
00:12:55,799 --> 00:12:57,320
Jingmei and Yi are going out.

251
00:12:58,039 --> 00:12:59,519
We have an important guest here.

252
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,159
Ash is here.

253
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:04,720
Jingmei

254
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:05,519
Get ready.

255
00:13:05,799 --> 00:13:07,320
Go with Yi to pick up Aranoush.

256
00:13:07,759 --> 00:13:08,240
good

257
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:09,559
Miss Jingmei.

258
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:12,240
Actually, this is your last class.

259
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,679
The last lesson.

260
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:15,360
My afternoon flight

261
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:16,440
I'll leave soon.

262
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,120
Miss Mo.

263
00:13:21,679 --> 00:13:22,480
You're smart.

264
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:23,480
And very thoughtful.

265
00:13:23,879 --> 00:13:26,039
Although you don't like to answer questions,

266
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:26,960
But I believe

267
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,360
You've already mastered what I taught you.

268
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:30,840
Really?

269
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,639
Goodbye, Miss Jingmei.

270
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:38,639
Goodbye, Young Master Long.

271
00:13:38,919 --> 00:13:39,639
Goodbye, Mrs. Long.

272
00:13:39,879 --> 00:13:40,840
Thank you, Miss Mo.

273
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:53,639
Why are you so nervous?

274
00:13:54,039 --> 00:13:55,039
Are you so nervous?

275
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,039
Not nervous.

276
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,600
It's too tight.

277
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,559
So many snacks.

278
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,519
Who cares if you don't?

279
00:14:04,519 --> 00:14:05,360
You said that

280
00:14:06,519 --> 00:14:08,360
When is Aranoush coming?

281
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:09,919
I'll strangle you if you don't come.

282
00:14:11,159 --> 00:14:12,399
Let me loosen it for you.

283
00:14:13,399 --> 00:14:14,000
No need

284
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,480
I'll loosen it for you.

285
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:16,320
No need

286
00:14:59,799 --> 00:15:01,519
So handsome.

287
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:02,679
Be more reserved.

288
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:06,399
This face must be very handsome in the camera.

289
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:07,840
hi

290
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,440
Hi, welcome to China.

291
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:10,840
You can speak Chinese.

292
00:15:11,039 --> 00:15:11,960
I know 16 languages.

293
00:15:14,879 --> 00:15:16,519
Who is the Sixteen Kingdoms?

294
00:15:16,759 --> 00:15:17,360
what

295
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:26,919
Nothing

296
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:27,960
How are you?

297
00:15:28,519 --> 00:15:29,679
My name is Long Yi.

298
00:15:31,399 --> 00:15:34,000
You're the Aranush.

299
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:35,720
Ashranu

300
00:15:37,679 --> 00:15:38,799
Hello, Mr. Xiao Long.

301
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,679
Who is this?

302
00:15:40,679 --> 00:15:41,480
Why

303
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:42,879
This is my wife.

304
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,159
Zhang Jingmei

305
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,360
Hello, Ash.

306
00:15:46,759 --> 00:15:47,480
Ashe

307
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:51,159
Aranush, sorry.

308
00:15:51,559 --> 00:15:52,639
Ash is beautiful.

309
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:53,759
From now on,

310
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:56,120
My Chinese name is Ash.

311
00:15:57,799 --> 00:15:58,840
Hello, Miss Jingmei.

312
00:16:07,799 --> 00:16:08,720
This is me.

313
00:16:08,879 --> 00:16:09,559
Long Yi.

314
00:16:09,679 --> 00:16:11,279
And Ashe's first meeting.

315
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,440
I never thought

316
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:15,120
My grandfather has such a

317
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,960
A friend who is forty years apart.

318
00:16:17,639 --> 00:16:18,120
Wait

319
00:16:18,279 --> 00:16:19,840
Who added the special effect?

320
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:25,600
This is good.

321
00:16:31,559 --> 00:16:32,720
Three, two.

322
00:16:32,919 --> 00:16:33,600
One more.

323
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:35,159
Master Luo,

324
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:37,279
I only promise to treat you to dinner.

325
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,720
I didn't promise to go shopping with you.

326
00:16:40,919 --> 00:16:41,960
Miss Chen,

327
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:43,399
To eat with you.

328
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:45,840
I have to investigate the surrounding environment?

329
00:16:46,559 --> 00:16:47,600
Look at this cultural temperament.

330
00:16:47,919 --> 00:16:48,720
The taste of art

331
00:16:49,559 --> 00:16:50,960
It's food for the mind.

332
00:16:51,399 --> 00:16:52,039
What about

333
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:53,360
You can cook.

334
00:16:53,799 --> 00:16:54,440
Pretty good

335
00:16:54,759 --> 00:16:55,519
Are you full?

336
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:56,799
We're full. Let's go.

337
00:16:58,159 --> 00:16:59,039
Spiritual food.

338
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:07,920
please

339
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:20,920
This is too big.

340
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,039
It's like a palace.

341
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,319
What? The palace.

342
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:25,799
It's not as big as our garden.

343
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:27,480
It's only 200 square meters.

344
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:29,039
Is this about the area?

345
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:31,799
Look at the decoration.

346
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:33,400
This design

347
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,279
This design

348
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:41,440
That's great.

349
00:17:42,319 --> 00:17:43,880
If I didn't look carefully,

350
00:17:44,039 --> 00:17:46,799
I didn't even know it was a fake.

351
00:17:49,319 --> 00:17:50,119
Come on.

352
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:03,559
Mr.Luo

353
00:18:03,559 --> 00:18:04,720
Your wine is ready.

354
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:05,759
Shall we start serving now?

355
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,039
Okay, thank you.

356
00:18:09,799 --> 00:18:10,519
Luo Beichen.

357
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:12,839
You're good at this.

358
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:14,720
How many girls have you fooled?

359
00:18:16,599 --> 00:18:17,160
what?

360
00:18:17,559 --> 00:18:18,079
Do you mind?

361
00:18:18,759 --> 00:18:21,119
I only care if your order is good.

362
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:26,119
The best food here is sashimi.

363
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:27,640
Besides the sashimi,

364
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:31,400
You don't have to eat salmon and lobster.

365
00:18:31,799 --> 00:18:33,200
You ate a lot in Australia, right?

366
00:18:34,039 --> 00:18:35,720
But the fish here

367
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:38,920
You should try it.

368
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,400
The meat of the fish is too hard.

369
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,119
I don't like it.

370
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:43,880
Are you talking about the cold winter migration?

371
00:18:44,079 --> 00:18:45,759
It's summer now.

372
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:47,839
When a fish grows up,

373
00:18:48,359 --> 00:18:49,839
It takes three years to grow.

374
00:18:50,759 --> 00:18:51,920
At different growth stages,

375
00:18:52,319 --> 00:18:53,119
With different names.

376
00:18:53,559 --> 00:18:55,519
Different meat and taste.

377
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,480
This is the juvenile of the fish.

378
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:58,640
The meat is delicious.

379
00:18:59,519 --> 00:19:01,160
The first is

380
00:19:02,039 --> 00:19:03,200
His body length is 800.

381
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:04,079
Juvenile

382
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:07,000
The meat is very tender.

383
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,839
The second one is equality.

384
00:19:10,119 --> 00:19:12,319
You can't catch up with the ordinary luck.

385
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,839
But I even made an appointment with the goddess.

386
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,400
It's definitely not ordinary luck.

387
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:22,599
And this.

388
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:23,359
Eight.

389
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,079
It's two meters long.

390
00:19:24,519 --> 00:19:25,960
The best one is the abdomen.

391
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:27,200
come

392
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:29,240
Try it.

393
00:19:30,079 --> 00:19:31,480
What makes you think I'm in Australia?

394
00:19:31,799 --> 00:19:33,000
You must like to eat fish.

395
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:36,400
It's a guess.

396
00:19:37,839 --> 00:19:38,839
Don't I have to tell you?

397
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:41,960
Chen Xuanyi has fish for eight out of ten meals.

398
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:43,759
And two sashimi.

399
00:19:45,759 --> 00:19:46,480
It's a guess.

400
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:55,519
Look at that building.

401
00:19:56,279 --> 00:19:58,000
It looks ordinary.

402
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,319
But it's a model of structural design.

403
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:02,359
Cubism

404
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:05,000
Construction of Multi-dimensional Space Sense by Graphic Design

405
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:08,359
Known as Contemporary Picasso in the industrial design circle.

406
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,240
I didn't see it.

407
00:20:13,839 --> 00:20:14,599
You know that.

408
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:16,480
The writer is Kitano.

409
00:20:17,839 --> 00:20:19,000
A genius in the design world.

410
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:20,319
However

411
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:22,440
He only likes to design

412
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:24,079
It looks childish.

413
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,160
What?

414
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,640
I really admire his personality.

415
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:28,839
I really admire his talent.

416
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:30,279
We have

417
00:20:30,279 --> 00:20:31,759
Omega Game Box Land

418
00:20:31,759 --> 00:20:32,960
I always wanted to cooperate with him.

419
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,559
But he's too low-key.

420
00:20:35,319 --> 00:20:36,279
And never showed up.

421
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,599
So no one knows who he is.

422
00:20:42,839 --> 00:20:43,720
Why are you laughing?

423
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:45,400
Nothing, nothing.

424
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:50,599
If I say,

425
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,480
I have Kitano's contact information.

426
00:20:54,519 --> 00:20:55,039
Do you believe that?

427
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:58,680
you

428
00:20:59,279 --> 00:20:59,880
Miss Jingmei.

429
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,400
You know so much about art.

430
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,960
Do you like black tea?

431
00:21:04,759 --> 00:21:06,559
The black tea is sweet and mellow.

432
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:07,319
I like it so much

433
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:09,720
This tea

434
00:21:10,079 --> 00:21:10,720
It's called Beauty Tip.

435
00:21:11,319 --> 00:21:13,079
It's our famous black tea.

436
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,759
The first one is a little bitter.

437
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:17,279
But the taste is rich.

438
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,319
The taste is sweet.

439
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:20,480
Where are you?

440
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:23,640
It tastes of mint and lily of the valley.

441
00:21:33,079 --> 00:21:33,720
wife

442
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:34,720
Are you cold?

443
00:21:36,279 --> 00:21:37,119
Hold on.

444
00:21:37,359 --> 00:21:38,359
Come on, Miss Jingmei.

445
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:39,440
Mr. Xiao Long.

446
00:21:40,039 --> 00:21:40,680
Taste it.

447
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:47,640
It smells good.

448
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:57,000
I've never had such a special black tea.

449
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:58,839
What smells good?

450
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,680
Tea originated in China.

451
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,319
Is there no black tea in China?

452
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,400
Don't mind.

453
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:08,519
That's how he is.

454
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:09,400
especially

455
00:22:10,039 --> 00:22:10,759
patriotic

456
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,160
To the tea and not to the people.

457
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:13,559
husband

458
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:14,559
Try it.

459
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,799
It seems that

460
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,279
You know a lot about black tea.

461
00:22:21,759 --> 00:22:22,680
Then you should know

462
00:22:23,279 --> 00:22:26,160
When did black tea become popular all over the world?

463
00:22:27,559 --> 00:22:29,039
I'm drinking milk.

464
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,319
Then I have to know

465
00:22:30,319 --> 00:22:31,519
Who raised the cow?

466
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:35,200
In the 17th century.

467
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:36,599
Princess Catherine of Portugal

468
00:22:37,119 --> 00:22:38,759
To marry King Charles II.

469
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,279
Her dowry

470
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:41,880
How many boxes of Chinese black tea?

471
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,880
From then on, it spread to the British royal family.

472
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,000
In Europe.

473
00:22:48,519 --> 00:22:50,880
And then spread to the whole world.

474
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:57,200
Ashe

475
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,440
You know so much?

476
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:00,559
Let me ask you a question.

477
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:03,000
The Princess Catherine you mentioned

478
00:23:03,559 --> 00:23:06,400
How did you get Chinese black tea?

479
00:23:09,119 --> 00:23:10,839
Who raised the cows?

480
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:12,960
It's not important.

481
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:22,799
Did you see that?

482
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:23,759
We have found the target.
