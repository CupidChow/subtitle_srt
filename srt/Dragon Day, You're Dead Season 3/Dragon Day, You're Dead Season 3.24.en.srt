1
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:27,000
Hello. Welcome.

2
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,479
You have to supervise everyone,

3
00:02:28,919 --> 00:02:29,879
and do a good job of hygiene.

4
00:02:29,879 --> 00:02:31,039
You open a jewelry store?

5
00:02:31,719 --> 00:02:32,680
Why do you have so many lights?

6
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,560
It's a rare guest.

7
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,560
You must have never been in a film crew.

8
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,759
This is called a matching ambience light,

9
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:40,439
you know?

10
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,120
Then you might as well work on the lighting of the crew.

11
00:02:44,759 --> 00:02:45,240
Brother,

12
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,240
this is what you don't understand.

13
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:49,560
Did you see that?

14
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:50,560
These lights,

15
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:52,479
these are all solid wood,

16
00:02:53,319 --> 00:02:55,039
These are worthy of my products.

17
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:56,280
At the same level,

18
00:02:56,599 --> 00:02:57,159
two words,

19
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:57,960
High-class,

20
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:01,400
good business.

21
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:05,840
You're welcome.

22
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:06,759
Brother Yu,

23
00:03:07,159 --> 00:03:08,159
when your new store opens,

24
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,599
I didn't ask anyone to come and have fun.

25
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,199
With what you said,

26
00:03:11,639 --> 00:03:12,800
my brother Yu is here.

27
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,599
Who else should I be looking for?

28
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:15,759
I'm your only brother.

29
00:03:16,439 --> 00:03:17,960
You're so unpopular.

30
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:20,639
Luo Beichen,

31
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:21,599
I don't know where he went.

32
00:03:21,719 --> 00:03:22,800
You must be looking for peach blossoms.

33
00:03:24,039 --> 00:03:24,879
My character.

34
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:25,759
I'm leaving too.

35
00:03:26,719 --> 00:03:27,400
Where are you going?

36
00:03:28,199 --> 00:03:28,879
Have a seat.

37
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:29,719
Africa,

38
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:30,879
Africa.

39
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:36,000
Mr. Luo, please stay.

40
00:03:36,639 --> 00:03:37,240
Mr. Luo,

41
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:38,639
Miss Chen asked me to give this to you.

42
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:00,680
Where's Chen Xuanyi?

43
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,240
Mr. Chen is not here.

44
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:09,199
Chen Xuanyi,

45
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:11,800
Chen Xuanyi,

46
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:13,840
Chen Xuanyi,

47
00:04:15,159 --> 00:04:15,439
Mr. Luo,

48
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:16,199
Chen Xuanyi,

49
00:04:16,439 --> 00:04:16,879
Mr. Luo,

50
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,240
Mr. Chen is really not here.

51
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,040
Chen Xuanyi,

52
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:19,600
Mr. Luo,

53
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,399
Chen Xuanyi,

54
00:04:22,839 --> 00:04:23,399
Chen Xuanyi,

55
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:25,720
Let go,

56
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,439
Luo Beichen. I'm warning you,

57
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,560
This is not a place where you can act rashly.

58
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,319
You warned me.

59
00:04:33,079 --> 00:04:34,079
Who are you to warn me?

60
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:35,399
By the way,

61
00:04:37,399 --> 00:04:39,079
you also like Chen Xuanyi, right?

62
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,040
Come on.

63
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,360
Declare war.

64
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:51,439
Luo Beichen,

65
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:54,639
do you think this is your studio for fun?

66
00:04:56,439 --> 00:04:57,120
What did you say?

67
00:04:57,279 --> 00:04:59,120
Mr. Chen spent countless days and nights,

68
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,199
and devoted countless efforts here.

69
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:01,920
A place created bit by bit.

70
00:05:03,079 --> 00:05:05,040
Every person and every job here,

71
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,480
Mr. Chen cherishes them.

72
00:05:06,879 --> 00:05:08,759
So no matter what big reason you have,

73
00:05:08,839 --> 00:05:09,480
I won't allow you

74
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,079
to ruin a single point of this place.

75
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:17,720
You want to protect her, right?

76
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:19,800
You want to guard her, right?

77
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,399
But she doesn't appreciate it at all.

78
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,720
Do you know why?

79
00:05:27,399 --> 00:05:29,360
Because you can't be on that list at all.

80
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,519
Do you know what a list is?

81
00:05:31,639 --> 00:05:32,399
You have to be rich.

82
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:33,079
Do you have money?

83
00:05:33,079 --> 00:05:33,639
What are you talking about?

84
00:05:33,639 --> 00:05:34,399
I'm poor.

85
00:05:34,399 --> 00:05:35,319
You bastard!

86
00:05:35,959 --> 00:05:36,720
You're so selfish,

87
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,319
you don't deserve to love Xuanyi at all.

88
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,079
Do you know how hard it has been for her along the way?

89
00:05:48,839 --> 00:05:50,720
Since she was nine years old, she has been relying on others,

90
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,439
looking at people's faces,

91
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,680
Watching her mother

92
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,240
marry another man and have children,

93
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:58,079
I still have to work hard to please grandpa.

94
00:05:59,079 --> 00:06:00,000
Not only that,

95
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:01,800
but the things that originally belonged to her,

96
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,759
She has to hand them over one by one.

97
00:06:03,879 --> 00:06:06,079
Let uncle and uncle take whatever they want from her,

98
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,959
she doesn't want money,

99
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,639
What you want is the strength to fight with her

100
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:11,519
and the sense of security,

101
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:12,439
Do you have one?

102
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:25,879
how

103
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,079
Is it twisted?

104
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:32,959
Uncle,

105
00:06:33,959 --> 00:06:36,680
do you know where else Xuanyi can go?

106
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,319
Well,

107
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:41,680
Uncle.

108
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:45,480
Okay,

109
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,199
I'll give you an address.

110
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:51,360
Although she doesn't often go to this place,

111
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:54,959
if she's not here,

112
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:57,000
I don't know where she is.

113
00:06:57,399 --> 00:06:58,639
Try your luck.

114
00:06:58,879 --> 00:06:59,519
Thank you, uncle.

115
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,160
Thank you, uncle. Thank you, uncle.

116
00:07:23,519 --> 00:07:23,959
Mr. Chen,

117
00:07:23,959 --> 00:07:24,680
information about the Luo family.

118
00:07:36,199 --> 00:07:37,480
With all this money,

119
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:39,040
you still want to chase Xuanyi?

120
00:07:40,439 --> 00:07:42,560
I wish you a harmonious union lasting a hundred years.

121
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:53,600
Hey,

122
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:54,839
Hello, Dad.

123
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:55,959
What are you doing?

124
00:07:55,959 --> 00:07:56,759
I'm busy.

125
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,040
You brat.

126
00:07:58,399 --> 00:08:00,879
I asked you to familiarize yourself with Longchen Fund's business,

127
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,079
how much are you familiar with?

128
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,560
I haven't graduated yet.

129
00:08:04,759 --> 00:08:06,439
Don't you still have my cousin?

130
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:08,439
Don't be your cousin,

131
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:11,639
you are the eldest son and grandson of the Chen family.

132
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,639
All the properties of Chen's family,

133
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:14,800
will be yours sooner or later.

134
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:16,399
Besides,

135
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:18,519
your cousin is getting married soon,

136
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:20,319
Who do you expect to go then?

137
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:21,560
Dad,

138
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:22,839
Dad,

139
00:08:22,839 --> 00:08:23,160
Hey,

140
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:23,360
Dad,

141
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:23,839
Hello.

142
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:33,960
Sir,

143
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:35,320
who are you looking for?

144
00:08:35,639 --> 00:08:36,559
1058 Miss Chen.

145
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:41,039
Bro, here's the thing. She told me

146
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:42,399
to keep it a secret.

147
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:43,559
She said she doesn't come here often,

148
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:44,759
so no one knows she's here.

149
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:46,279
Brother,

150
00:08:46,879 --> 00:08:47,879
you won't tell anyone, will you?

151
00:08:49,159 --> 00:08:50,039
It's okay. Please come in.

152
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:05,919
Chen Xuanyi.

153
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:09,679
Chen Xuanyi,

154
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:12,600
I know you're home.

155
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,080
If I can't see you today,

156
00:09:16,679 --> 00:09:17,320
I won't leave.

157
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:19,159
Chen Xuanyi,

158
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:20,639
Chen Xuanyi,

159
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,240
Chen Xuanyi.

160
00:09:25,879 --> 00:09:26,279
Xuan.

161
00:09:29,879 --> 00:09:30,559
Yes,

162
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,519
can we go now?

163
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,559
Is it interesting for you

164
00:09:38,759 --> 00:09:40,039
to torture yourself to avoid me?

165
00:09:40,639 --> 00:09:41,519
You think too much.

166
00:09:42,159 --> 00:09:43,200
I did it for myself.

167
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:48,919
Your list is so important.

168
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:50,759
Don't you already have an answer in your heart?

169
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,480
I want to hear you tell me in person,

170
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,639
if someone is not on that list,

171
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,039
There will never be a chance.

172
00:09:59,279 --> 00:09:59,720
Yes.

173
00:10:08,679 --> 00:10:10,200
Chen Xuanyi, don't be silly, okay?

174
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,120
Maybe your father

175
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,759
doesn't want you to compete for any industry at all.

176
00:10:13,759 --> 00:10:15,120
Maybe he doesn't care about that at all.

177
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,000
Maybe he doesn't

178
00:10:18,279 --> 00:10:19,759
care at all.

179
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,600
That's enough. Stop it.

180
00:10:22,559 --> 00:10:23,159
Xuanyi.

181
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:32,799
Xuanyi,

182
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:36,039
I'm sorry,

183
00:10:37,559 --> 00:10:37,919
Me.

184
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,480
Please let me go.

185
00:10:45,879 --> 00:10:46,600
Is that okay?

186
00:10:49,159 --> 00:10:49,519
Okay,

187
00:10:51,879 --> 00:10:52,519
I can't give you

188
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,000
what you want.

189
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,320
So from today on.

190
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,120
I'm Kitano,

191
00:11:08,639 --> 00:11:09,840
and you're Mr. Chen?

192
00:11:12,279 --> 00:11:13,559
Apart from work,

193
00:11:16,279 --> 00:11:17,440
we have nothing to do with each other.

194
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,240
I, Luo Beichen,

195
00:11:21,559 --> 00:11:23,440
will disappear completely from your world.

196
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:26,799
I won't bother you anymore.

197
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,720
Goodbye.

198
00:12:36,519 --> 00:12:37,120
Dad.

199
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:42,600

Auntie

It's too much trouble to get married.

235
00:13:54,919 --> 00:13:56,440
Marriage is a major event in life.

236
00:13:56,519 --> 00:13:57,840
Of course you have to pay attention to it.

She should be on the plane now.

249

She's about to land.

250
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:20,840
Do you need us to pick it up?

251
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:21,600
No need.

252
00:14:21,919 --> 00:14:23,679
She has a tight schedule,

253
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:26,120
so she needs Mr. Long and Mrs. Long

254
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,240
to cooperate with her.

255

Thank you.

263
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:39,080
I always feel like I'm missing something?

264
00:14:42,039 --> 00:14:42,559
Director,

265
00:14:42,879 --> 00:14:44,039
look at this shot,

266
00:14:44,039 --> 00:14:46,399
How about shaking it from the water?

267
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:51,919
Tell me,

268
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:55,399
use the calmness of the water to set off the murderous atmosphere.

269
00:14:55,559 --> 00:14:57,879
Is it more conducive to the development of the plot?

270
00:14:59,679 --> 00:15:00,559
Good for you. Yiyi

271
00:15:00,559 --> 00:15:01,440
has a lot of ideas.

272
00:15:02,519 --> 00:15:03,360
Director, don't you remember,

273
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:05,080
the big painting you shot before,

274
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,279
I've used this kind of lens before.

275
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:08,480
Yes.

276
00:15:08,559 --> 00:15:09,639
You've seen that movie,

277
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:11,120
Yiyi.

278
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:11,879
Come here.

279
00:15:12,519 --> 00:15:13,320
Director, I'll go there first.

280
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:13,679
Okay,

281
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:15,360
Morning,

282
00:15:16,759 --> 00:15:17,360

Director Wang eating fruit.

284
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:19,120
Thank you.

285
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,480
There seems to be a conflict

286
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,039
at this time. I see.

287
00:15:22,279 --> 00:15:22,559
Director Wang,

288
00:15:22,559 --> 00:15:23,080
let's adjust this time, right?

289
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,639
Where did you find this girl?

290
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:25,120
What?

291
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,120
Sorry for the trouble.

292
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,240
Did you catch a cold?

293
00:15:29,159 --> 00:15:29,519
No.

294
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:30,720
I just caught a cold.

295
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:31,759
Brother Xing, don't worry.

296
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:32,799
I'll notify these actors.

297
00:15:32,919 --> 00:15:33,960
It's been so hard.

298
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:34,919
What's wrong?

299
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:36,200
No, no, no.

300
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:37,320
You've helped me a lot.

301
00:15:37,679 --> 00:15:38,279
Really?

302
00:15:38,879 --> 00:15:39,600
Help me with what?

303
00:15:40,919 --> 00:15:43,279
Lin Meng will be able to

304
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:44,440
get off the car in two minutes.

305
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:45,480
Is this talent?

306
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,200
This girl is really nice.

307
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,480
You have a good grasp of the characters.

308
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:53,679
It looks like a camera.

309
00:15:54,919 --> 00:15:55,279
That's great.

310
00:15:56,759 --> 00:15:57,440
He's diligent

311
00:15:57,679 --> 00:15:58,480
and smart.

312
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:00,240
I'm sure I'll be able to come out when I have a chance.

313
00:16:02,679 --> 00:16:03,279
You have potential.

314
00:16:04,679 --> 00:16:05,159
Liuliu,

315
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:06,759
bring me the milk tea.

316
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:08,159
I'll go see him off.

317
00:16:08,159 --> 00:16:08,519
Okay,

318
00:16:08,519 --> 00:16:09,519
Keep an eye on it.

319
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:10,879
When the fire is turned off,

320
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,039
don't you forget that I'm cooking pearls in my pot?

321
00:16:12,039 --> 00:16:12,840
Don't worry.

322
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,080
No problem. Don't worry, sister.

323
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,000
Do you hear me?

324
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,039
Got it.

325
00:16:17,639 --> 00:16:18,480
You,

326
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,320
Miss,

327
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:21,440
Zhang Dongshuai,

328
00:16:22,759 --> 00:16:23,759
Why are you here?

329
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:24,759
Why are you here?

330
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:26,840
I … I have an appointment with a friend.

331
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:27,960
This is my shop,

332
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:30,000
this is

333
00:16:30,159 --> 00:16:31,639
the milk tea shop you opened with my sister,

334
00:16:31,879 --> 00:16:32,320
That's right.

335
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:33,720
Where's your friend?

336
00:16:34,039 --> 00:16:34,960
Where is your friend?

337
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:35,600
What a coincidence.

338
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,879
If my sister finds out, she'll scold me to death.

339
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:38,080
My clothes are dirty.

340
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,320
I have to go back and get a new one.

341
00:16:40,039 --> 00:16:40,840
Change it at my place.

342
00:16:40,879 --> 00:16:41,759
I'll wash it for you.

343
00:16:42,039 --> 00:16:42,519
No,

344
00:16:42,519 --> 00:16:42,960
I'll go back,

345
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:43,960
How long will it take you to go back?

346
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:44,279
Let's go.

347
00:16:44,279 --> 00:16:45,200
No, I'm really

348
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:45,639
leaving.

349
00:16:45,639 --> 00:16:46,360
No, no, no.

350
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:47,000
Miss.

351
00:16:59,440 --> 00:16:59,720
Sis,

352
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,159
The scene is ready.

353
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:02,279
Let me let you know.

354
00:17:04,839 --> 00:17:05,440
Who is it?

355
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,240
Bring me some water.

356
00:17:08,119 --> 00:17:09,000
Okay. Okay, Sister Hua Hua.

357
00:17:10,599 --> 00:17:10,839
Here,

358
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:13,119
Mineral water?

359
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,400
How am I supposed to drink it when it's so cold?

360
00:17:15,759 --> 00:17:16,680
Get me some hot water.

361
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,079
Isn't there a water dispenser?

362
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:23,640
-Okay. -Sister Hua Hua,

363
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:25,880
Yiyi.

364
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,599
Mengshui,

365
00:17:34,839 --> 00:17:35,839
why are you here?

366
00:17:36,079 --> 00:17:36,680
Then who is it?

367
00:17:39,079 --> 00:17:40,240
Are you kidding me?

368
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,079
This dress is large.

369
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:46,799
It should do.

370
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:48,480
Take it off.

371
00:17:48,599 --> 00:17:49,160
I'll wash it for you.

372
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,119
I'd better go home.

373
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:54,480
You won't be able to wash the clothes when you go home.

374
00:17:55,279 --> 00:17:55,759
Hurry up.

375
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:01,519
Maybe I should go back.

376
00:18:01,519 --> 00:18:01,680
Maybe I should go back.

377
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,079
Why are you so dawdling?

378
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:03,880
Change it.

379
00:18:04,079 --> 00:18:04,839
Or I'll change it for you.

380
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:05,440
Me,

381
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,000
Hurry up.

382
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:16,960
Welcome.

383
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:19,319
It's open for trial today.

384

60% off for the whole audience.

385
00:18:20,839 --> 00:18:21,880
Isn't it too expensive?

386
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:23,000
Let's go.

387
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,119
Forget it. We won't buy it.

388
00:18:24,359 --> 00:18:24,799
Let's go.

389
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:30,559
Welcome.

390
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:31,440
It's open for trial today.

391
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:32,240
60% off for the whole audience.

392
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:32,960
Hello,

393
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:33,680
how much is this?

394
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:34,359
For this,

395
00:18:34,359 --> 00:18:35,240
this 28thousand,

396
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:36,400
Honey,

397
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,079
it's too expensive.

398
00:18:37,079 --> 00:18:37,960
Let's go.

399
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:49,319
Welcome.

400
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:50,799
It's open for trial today.

401
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:51,680
60% off for the whole audience.

402
00:18:53,119 --> 00:18:54,000
How about this one?

403
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:57,599
I think this one should be whiter.

404
00:18:57,599 --> 00:18:58,799
Because I have yellow skin,

405
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:00,240
as long as you like it.

406
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:01,559
You have a good taste.

407
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,119
How about I take it out and you try it on?

408
00:19:04,119 --> 00:19:04,599
Honey,

409
00:19:04,599 --> 00:19:05,599
business is good.

410
00:19:09,839 --> 00:19:10,480
Anita,

411
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:12,319
you're on the ground.

412
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:15,880
Okay.

413
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:39,359
It's done.

414
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:40,480
Don't worry.

415
00:19:43,359 --> 00:19:44,039
Where's your friend?

416
00:19:44,319 --> 00:19:44,960
Hasn't he come yet?

417
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:48,640
Miss,

418
00:19:49,839 --> 00:19:50,759
Bowen, you're so beautiful.

419
00:19:50,759 --> 00:19:51,720
You're back.

420
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:56,920
AD calcium milk.

421
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,039
Prodigal son,

422
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:06,640
what are you two doing here?

423
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:07,960
This man-to-man thing,

424
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:09,000
Mom, don't worry about it.

425
00:20:09,279 --> 00:20:10,240
Mom,

426
00:20:10,599 --> 00:20:12,079
who is your mom?

427
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:13,519
Me,

428
00:20:13,799 --> 00:20:14,119
Well

429
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:16,160
Your child is so old.

430
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,519
When... When did you get married?

431
00:20:18,519 --> 00:20:19,480
Why didn't I know?

432
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,200
How is that possible?

433
00:20:22,519 --> 00:20:23,279
It's

434
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:24,640
a long story.

435
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:26,359
But you two,

436
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:27,640
what's going on?

437
00:20:28,359 --> 00:20:29,599
He won't admit defeat in the game,

438
00:20:29,759 --> 00:20:30,680
so he has to come to me.

439
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:32,240
He asked me to fight him.

440
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,559
Mom, do you know him?

441
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:36,480
This is your aunt Jingmei's brother. Have you

442
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:39,799
finished your homework?

443
00:20:40,039 --> 00:20:41,720
You've been playing games

444
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:42,599
all day long. You've already finished it.

445
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:44,799
Don't think that if you admit your relative,

446
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:46,119
I'll show mercy to you.

447
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,400
I'll still torture you.

448
00:20:52,119 --> 00:20:52,519
Come on.

449
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:53,759
I'm not afraid of anyone.

450
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:56,480
Miss Lin,

451
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:57,920
I think you may be mistaken.

452
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,640
I've never stayed in a hotel of the crew.

453
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,599
How could he take your necklace?

454
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,200
It's even more suspicious if you don't live here.

455
00:21:05,359 --> 00:21:07,119
Everyone lives together every day,

456
00:21:07,359 --> 00:21:09,079
why are you the only one who comes home every day?

457
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:11,519
Who knows what you brought home?

458
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:14,720
What about the evidence?

459
00:21:15,119 --> 00:21:16,880
Do you have any proof that I took it?

460
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,039
I have no proof.

461
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:21,160
If I have evidence, I'll call the police to arrest you.

462
00:21:21,359 --> 00:21:23,279
Do I have to talk nonsense with you here?

463
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,240
But let me tell you, Zhang Yiyi,

464
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:27,680
people are doing it and the sky is watching,

465
00:21:28,119 --> 00:21:30,079
I don't have to argue with you today,

466
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:31,640
but don't think that in the future,

467
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:33,160
You are always so lucky.

468
00:21:34,119 --> 00:21:36,599
I advise you to take care of yourself.

469
00:21:36,599 --> 00:21:37,880
Don't be unable to close the venue in the future.

470
00:21:38,319 --> 00:21:38,720
No,

471
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:41,960
Don't let me get away with it.

472
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:44,559
I think it's better for you to check it out.

473
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:46,440
But today,

474
00:21:46,759 --> 00:21:48,160
if you don't have any evidence to prove

475
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,599
that I took your necklace.

476
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:51,960
Please apologize to me

477
00:21:52,359 --> 00:21:53,119
in front of the whole group.

478
00:21:53,119 --> 00:21:53,319
Apologize to me.

479
00:21:54,519 --> 00:21:55,799
Who do you think you are?

480
00:21:56,359 --> 00:21:58,160
About a necklace costing tens of thousands of yuan,

481
00:21:58,440 --> 00:21:59,599
I don't care at all.

482
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:01,880
What I care about is everyone's time.

483
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:04,359
Why should I drag the whole team to waste time with you?

484
00:22:05,799 --> 00:22:06,599
How about this?

485
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:09,200
Or you can return the necklace.

486
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:12,119
Or you can recognize a lovely necklace with me

487
00:22:12,759 --> 00:22:14,079
and treat it as a gift for you.

488
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:20,880
Then call the police.

489
00:22:22,359 --> 00:22:23,279
Director,

490
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:24,160
Yiyi,

491
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:25,359
Why did you call the police?

492
00:22:26,119 --> 00:22:27,319
We still have to catch up with the progress.

493
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:28,400
That's enough.

494
00:22:28,759 --> 00:22:30,240
I told you not to argue with her.

495
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:31,839
What's her attitude?

496
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:33,279
Threatening me with the police.

497
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:35,480
He's a public figure,

498
00:22:36,359 --> 00:22:37,039
Exactly

499
00:22:39,599 --> 00:22:40,599
Yiyi,

500
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,640
forget it. She just wants to save face.

501
00:22:44,119 --> 00:22:44,920
Apologize to her.

502
00:22:45,839 --> 00:22:46,880
I didn't take it.

503
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,680
Why should I apologize?

504
00:22:49,079 --> 00:22:49,759
You should feel wronged

505
00:22:50,599 --> 00:22:52,680
when you're away from home.

506
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:54,079
I can't stand this grievance.

507
00:22:54,079 --> 00:22:55,000
How to mix the crew,

508
00:22:55,599 --> 00:22:56,440
take a step back and say,

509
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:57,799
You are really wronged.

510
00:22:58,079 --> 00:23:00,000
Sister Meng said she won't argue with you anymore.

511
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,319
Don't be willful.

512
00:23:04,279 --> 00:23:04,880
