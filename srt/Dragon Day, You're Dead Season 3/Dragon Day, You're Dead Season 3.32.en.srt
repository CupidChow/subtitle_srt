1
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,240
Long Yi.

2
00:02:25,159 --> 00:02:26,360
You're trapped.

3
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,560
I trapped you.

4
00:02:40,639 --> 00:02:42,199
I should let you go.

5
00:02:49,159 --> 00:02:50,319
You want to break up?

6
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:56,400
Zhang Jingmei

7
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,719
I know you like that kind of independence and confidence.

8
00:02:58,919 --> 00:03:01,159
You like to be responsible.

9
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:01,879
Have a goal.

10
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,840
Who can work hard for their goals.

11
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,000
I want to.

12
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,479
But no one is born with it.

13
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,479
I'm trying.

14
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,520
I can do it.

15
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,960
What I like is right?

16
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,159
Is Zhang Jingmei right?

17
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:18,639
Why did you let Zhang Jingmei

18
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:20,039
In your life.

19
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:22,000
Why don't you be yourself?

20
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,240
husband

21
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:21,959
Jingmei

22
00:05:27,639 --> 00:05:28,120
Jingmei

23
00:06:31,519 --> 00:06:32,199
Come and eat.

24
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,240
After all, Yi is still young.

25
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,240
Opening a shop is just for fun.

26
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,279
He's still young.

27
00:06:40,519 --> 00:06:41,600
He's married.

28
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:43,759
I'm really...

29
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,040
I'm not afraid that he will cause trouble.

30
00:06:46,879 --> 00:06:48,279
It's about losing money.

31
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:49,920
I'm worried about him.

32
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:52,319
If your confidence gets frustrated,

33
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,079
It's hard to establish it again.

34
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:57,240
Why don't you tell Dad?

35
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:58,720
In the company,

36
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,879
An important position.

37
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,519
I think he's thinking about

38
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,519
Are all on Jingmei.

39
00:07:06,399 --> 00:07:07,120
Let's have a look.

40
00:07:08,279 --> 00:07:08,720
Having dinner

41
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,839
Come and have a vegetarian meal.

42
00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:16,839
good

43
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:50,360
Zhang Jingmei

44
00:07:51,079 --> 00:07:52,839
Can't we take the elevator?

45
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,079
I'm tired.

46
00:07:54,079 --> 00:07:55,720
Why do you have to climb the stairs step by step?

47
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:56,759
I'm worried about him.

48
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,199
If your confidence gets frustrated,

49
00:07:59,439 --> 00:08:01,000
It's hard to establish it again.

50
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,040
I belong to the top of the mountain.

51
00:08:14,199 --> 00:08:16,240
Who have seen the scenery at the top of the mountain.

52
00:08:17,879 --> 00:08:19,000
I have to climb the mountain with you.

53
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:19,800
It's a waste.

54
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,240
My limited time and energy

55
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:22,959
I think he's thinking about

56
00:08:22,959 --> 00:08:23,879
Are all on Jingmei.

57
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,759
We can talk about it later.

58
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:00,039
You fixed these lights.

59
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,519
To be exact,

60
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:02,480
I asked someone to fix it.

61
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,759
My wife is a coward.

62
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:12,679
Zhang Jingmei

63
00:09:13,399 --> 00:09:15,159
Can't we take the elevator?

64
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,399
I'm tired.

65
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:18,039
Why do you have to climb the stairs step by step?

66
00:09:56,879 --> 00:09:57,480
feed

67
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:34,519
There you are, honey.

68
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:37,200
Where have you been?

69
00:11:39,679 --> 00:11:41,240
I've been working in the shop.

70
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:43,679
wife

71
00:11:47,879 --> 00:11:49,559
Honey, it was my fault yesterday.

72
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,320
Don't you know me well?

73
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:55,759
I just want to fix the beauty shop.

74
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:58,519
I want to show you.

75
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:00,960
Namely

76
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:02,879
You have to trust me.

77
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,519
If you don't believe me,

78
00:12:05,879 --> 00:12:08,759
It's meaningless for me to do this.

79
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,080
Long Yi.

80
00:12:15,879 --> 00:12:16,720
I'm sorry.

81
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:20,240
Honey,

82
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,360
Don't be like this.

83
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,279
I know I was wrong.

84
00:12:23,399 --> 00:12:24,360
Don't...

85
00:12:24,759 --> 00:12:25,519
I didn't even know.

86
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:28,440
Honey, give me another chance.

87
00:12:28,679 --> 00:12:30,519
I'm sure I can make this shop a success.

88
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:31,919
wife

89
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:34,279
Can you stop this?

90
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:38,519
What's wrong with me?

91
00:12:40,919 --> 00:12:42,799
Don't do everything for me.

92
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:46,720
Then who am I?

93
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:50,720
Don't you have anything you want to do?

94
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,120
To marry you.

95
00:13:02,559 --> 00:13:03,320
You've been

96
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,919
Is this the only thing to do?

97
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:11,000
What exactly do you want me to do?

98
00:13:15,759 --> 00:13:17,600
Your Long family has so many properties.

99
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,679
You can do whatever you want.

100
00:13:21,639 --> 00:13:22,120
Do you?

101
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:24,120
Do you only have

102
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,600
Do you have the title of Young Dragon?

103
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,120
How do you know there's only an empty name?

104
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,480
How do you know I didn't do anything?

105
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:30,519
I've done too much.

106
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:32,679
What did you do?

107
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,600
From the top to the bottom,

108
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,519
through and through

109
00:13:42,759 --> 00:13:44,559
Every brick and tile

110
00:13:44,879 --> 00:13:46,600
Your grandfather and your father.

111
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:49,039
With a lifetime of hard work.

112
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,039
What did you do?

113
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,519
If you spend your whole life

114
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:58,960
I just want to lean against the building.

115
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,080
Guard its gate.

116
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,919
Try not to let it fall.

117
00:14:05,559 --> 00:14:07,440
What's the difference between you and the security guard?

118
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:08,000
Long Yi.

119
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,240
Although your marriage is out of control,

120
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:10,320
But you can't lose control of the brakes.

121
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:14,679
I want to live if you don't want to.

122
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:45,399
to get on or into

123
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:53,080
Come on.

124
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:04,600
Slowly.

125
00:16:04,759 --> 00:16:05,480
Slow down.

126
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:17,919
Zhang Jingmei

127
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:20,120
Are you going too far?

128
00:16:22,799 --> 00:16:23,320
Zhang Jingmei

129
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:24,679
I'm sorry.

130
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:25,600
Don't you feel sorry for me?

131
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:34,639
Zhang Jingmei

132
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:36,559
Do we have to do this?

133
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,000
Hello, mom.

134
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,440
Hello, Jingmei.

135
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:54,120
I've done a lot of calculations today.

136
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,840
The invitation is missing.

137
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,000
Our neighbors

138
00:16:58,039 --> 00:16:59,639
Auntie Zhang, Aunt Yang.

139
00:16:59,639 --> 00:17:00,960
I grew up watching you.

140
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,879
Your marriage is such a big deal.

141
00:17:02,879 --> 00:17:05,279
It's a little inappropriate not to invite them.

142
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,440
Mom, I know.

143
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:07,680
I'll take a rest.

144
00:17:07,759 --> 00:17:08,200
Hang up.

145
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:22,319
What about

146
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:24,039
no problem

147
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,680
Everyone, everyone.

148
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:26,279
I'm in charge.

149
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:28,960
That's great.

150
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:29,599
So,

151
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:32,079
I can go to the island.

152
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:34,440
Don't worry. You can go.

153
00:17:35,079 --> 00:17:35,839
very good

154
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,480
Thanks to Jingmei.

155
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:38,200
That's right.

156
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:40,279
I have to prepare some swimsuits.

157
00:17:42,359 --> 00:17:43,799
We have to prepare.

158
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:44,480
Go on.

159
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:45,680
Three points.

160
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:46,240
Let's go.

161
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:46,880
Go on.

162
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,400
Good figure, three points.

163
00:17:54,599 --> 00:17:55,759
What's wrong with the detour?

164
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:59,039
I protected you so well back then.

165
00:17:59,359 --> 00:18:01,880
Dare not to make mistakes.

166
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:05,640
Yi, luckily, I didn't learn from you.

167
00:18:07,519 --> 00:18:07,960
dad

168
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,559
But you can't let him be.

169
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,799
His wedding is coming next week.

170
00:18:13,279 --> 00:18:13,680
In my opinion,

171
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:14,000
dad

172
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,680
You should transfer him back to the company.

173
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,680
In this way, you can be more serious.

174
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:18,200
Don't you think so?

175
00:18:18,759 --> 00:18:19,799
Just two more days.

176
00:18:20,359 --> 00:18:22,160
Let's see what he can do.

177
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:23,759
It will be two days later.

178
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:26,480
will

179
00:18:29,359 --> 00:18:30,039
He's really dead.

180
00:18:32,839 --> 00:18:34,000
Alright, kid.

181
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:35,640
You've grown up.

182
00:18:39,319 --> 00:18:40,160
Come again.

183
00:18:52,039 --> 00:18:53,680
Okay, don't think too much.

184
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:56,359
I think you are in love.

185
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:58,599
Don't think too much.

186
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:00,839
And feels inferior.

187
00:19:02,279 --> 00:19:02,880
That's right.

188
00:19:03,839 --> 00:19:05,839
People in love always feel inferior.

189
00:19:06,319 --> 00:19:08,680
The more you love each other, the more inferior you will be.

190
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:09,759
Are you ashamed of yourself?

191
00:19:12,039 --> 00:19:14,160
Of course I feel inferior.

192
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:16,680
In front of Chen Xuan Yi,

193
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:18,759
Is actually a fool.

194
00:19:20,079 --> 00:19:21,319
I knew she was so tired.

195
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:22,200
It's so hard.

196
00:19:23,319 --> 00:19:24,640
I can't help her at all.

197
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:28,400
I also want to go to her family.

198
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,759
Take back what belongs to her.

199
00:19:30,759 --> 00:19:32,400
But I really can't.

200
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,599
So don't embarrass yourself.

201
00:19:36,519 --> 00:19:38,359
Chen Xuanyi is not as difficult as you think.

202
00:19:38,839 --> 00:19:40,119
Go to her house and ask for it.

203
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,079
You think it's as easy as you?

204
00:19:42,759 --> 00:19:44,039
It's hard for both of us.

205
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:46,000
You are the young master of the Long Family.

206
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:49,640
Young Master Long.

207
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,160
Come on, Young Master Long.

208
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,079
Go back.

209
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:54,759
I spit it out.

210
00:19:54,759 --> 00:19:55,440
I'm hungry.

211
00:19:55,839 --> 00:19:56,480
Eat a big plate of chicken. Let's go.

212
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,279
Go back. I'll take a walk.

213
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:02,759
Where are we going?

214
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:40,279
Zhang Jingmei

215
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,240
I'm such a good man.

216
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:43,799
Won't your conscience hurt?

217
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,599
I'm warning you, Zhang Jingmei.

218
00:20:47,519 --> 00:20:49,079
It's not too late to regret.

219
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:51,319
I give you three minutes.

220
00:20:51,319 --> 00:20:52,599
Call me back.

221
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:54,079
otherwise

222
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:31,079
Brother Long.

223
00:21:34,079 --> 00:21:34,720
You got the wrong person.

224
00:21:35,559 --> 00:21:36,720
Without me, Xie,

225
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,319
We visited each other a while ago.

226
00:21:38,519 --> 00:21:39,759
I sold tea on the video.

227
00:21:44,839 --> 00:21:45,920
You were introduced by Yu Lang.

228
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:47,000
The tea master.

229
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:47,880
Hello, hello.

230
00:21:48,119 --> 00:21:49,039
Call me Xie.

231
00:21:49,279 --> 00:21:50,160
I'm selling tea.

232
00:21:50,319 --> 00:21:51,039
Is not a great god.

233
00:21:53,079 --> 00:21:53,480
wife

234
00:21:54,279 --> 00:21:55,960
There are only three cups left.

235
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,759
Why don't you drink it tomorrow?

236
00:21:59,319 --> 00:22:01,000
I really can't.

237
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:02,839
Keep guessing.

238
00:22:03,519 --> 00:22:03,720
come

239
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:09,359
Right. Did you guess it?

240
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:10,839
Brother, what's wrong with you?

241
00:22:13,759 --> 00:22:14,160
Nothing

242
00:22:14,839 --> 00:22:16,119
Thanks to your help last time.

243
00:22:16,279 --> 00:22:16,759
Thanks, brother.

244
00:22:16,759 --> 00:22:17,079
Nothing.

245
00:22:17,279 --> 00:22:18,359
Brother Yu's friends are my friends.

246
00:22:18,519 --> 00:22:18,799
Come on.

247
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:19,160
No, no.

248
00:22:19,519 --> 00:22:20,119
Come on.

249
00:22:21,119 --> 00:22:23,480
We have a lot of good tea here.

250
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:24,640
Although it's not a big brand,

251
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:25,720
But it tastes great.

252
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:26,119
come

253
00:22:26,119 --> 00:22:26,680
I really don't need it.

254
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:27,160
Try this.

255
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:27,640
Thank you.

256
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:28,799
Here, try this.

257
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:30,839
Thank you. I'll take it.

258
00:22:30,839 --> 00:22:33,119
What Xie said is absolutely reliable.

259
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:34,920
These netizens can testify to him.

260
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:35,839
next time

261
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:37,839
He said it's good to drink.

262
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:38,880
The tea is not good. He doesn't recommend it.

263
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:40,480
It's less than 50 days.

264
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,000
Xiao Xie's team performance

265
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,359
Has reached 50 million yuan.

266
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:45,279
How many

267
00:22:45,559 --> 00:22:46,160
Fifty million.

268
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:47,279
No, brother.

269
00:22:47,559 --> 00:22:48,319
It's a coincidence.

270
00:22:48,599 --> 00:22:49,799
Take this tea.

271
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:51,640
It's good. Come to me later.

272
00:22:52,039 --> 00:22:53,039
We're still live here.

273
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,200
Then next time,

274
00:22:54,319 --> 00:22:55,559
It's good. Keep looking for me.

275
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,119
Conscience is good.

276
00:22:58,359 --> 00:22:58,759
The netizens

277
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:00,319
This tea is

278
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:02,240
Is really delicious.

279
00:23:03,079 --> 00:23:04,200
A high mountain green tea.

280
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,319
The taste is absolutely reliable.

281
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:06,519
Very good tea.

282
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:07,839
Natural and organic.

283
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:09,680
How are you?

284
00:23:15,839 --> 00:23:16,279
eldest brother

285
00:23:17,279 --> 00:23:18,680
Are you quarreling with your sister-in-law?

286
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:20,000
Why aren't we quarreling?

287
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:22,000
How can a couple not fight?

288
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,839
You quarreled fiercely when you were young.

289
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:25,400
It's not working now.

290
00:23:25,759 --> 00:23:26,359
Why?

291
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,079
Listen to your wife.

292
00:23:28,119 --> 00:23:29,599
I will do whatever my wife asks.

293
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:36,519
My wife will do whatever she wants.

294
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,440
When did you listen to me?

295
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:43,519
Why didn't I listen to you?

296
00:23:43,799 --> 00:23:45,640
When you asked me to marry you, I married you.

297
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:47,000
You asked me to open a bun shop.

298
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:48,400
So I opened a bun shop.

299
00:23:48,599 --> 00:23:48,960
right or wrong?

300
00:23:49,359 --> 00:23:50,039
Be obedient.

301
00:23:50,039 --> 00:23:51,279
Stop it.

302
00:23:51,759 --> 00:23:52,400
Go to work.

303
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,240
My wife will do whatever she wants.

304
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:00,799
Who is it?

305
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:02,640
Go and have a look.

306
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:03,640
It's too late.

307
00:24:04,119 --> 00:24:04,799
Hurry up.

308
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:07,279
Hat, hat and hat.

309
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:10,279
How can he come?

310
00:24:16,599 --> 00:24:17,079
Hello, President Long.

311
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:23,559
Hello, President Long.

312
00:24:26,359 --> 00:24:27,200
You are the captain.

313
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,079
yes

314
00:24:30,319 --> 00:24:30,920
But President Long,

315
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:32,480
In our Long Group,

316
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:33,839
Has been working as a security guard for ten years.

317
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:36,960
I have changed six positions in the past ten years.

318
00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:38,519
The swimming pool

319
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:42,039
I came here to save people.

320
00:24:42,039 --> 00:24:44,279
Yes, I'm right.

321
00:24:44,839 --> 00:24:45,319
President Long.

322
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:47,359
I just transferred here a few days ago.

323
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:48,359
I will try my best.

324
00:24:48,599 --> 00:24:49,680
It was all my fault.

325
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:50,640
I was wrong, President Long.

326
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:51,799
What's wrong?

327
00:24:54,119 --> 00:24:55,559
I'm wrong everywhere.

328
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:56,880
As long as you come to me,

329
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:57,920
I must be wrong.

330
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:58,400
Yes

331
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:00,079
What are you talking about?

332
00:25:01,079 --> 00:25:01,559
That

333
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,440
I'll work with you from now on.

334
00:25:03,519 --> 00:25:04,400
Tell me what to do.

335
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,640
No, President Long, stop it.

336
00:25:07,079 --> 00:25:07,720
Who are you?

337
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:09,680
President Long.

338
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:13,440
President Long.

339
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,799
Why don't you go to my office and have a drink?

340
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:18,440
Have some tea.

341
00:25:18,519 --> 00:25:20,359
You usually drink tea at work.

342
00:25:20,599 --> 00:25:22,240
No way, President Long.

343
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:23,920
We are so busy.

344
00:25:24,039 --> 00:25:24,960
Are you busy?

345
00:25:25,319 --> 00:25:27,079
How important is our security work?

346
00:25:27,079 --> 00:25:28,160
It's too important.

347
00:25:28,519 --> 00:25:29,279
Go back to your work.

348
00:25:30,359 --> 00:25:31,039
Alright, President Long.

349
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:33,200
What should I do? I don't know what to do.

350
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:33,559
captain

351
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,039
I have something to tell you.

352
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:39,119
All right.

353
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:40,839
Brother, brother.

354
00:25:41,359 --> 00:25:42,079
You stay here.

355
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,359
I'll think of something.

356
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:44,920
My mother.
