00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:00,940
Go to bed early.

173
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:02,850
Okay, Grandpa.

174
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,610
Show Jingmei around tomorrow.

175
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:06,600
Make yourself at home,

176
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,690
We're all family members.

177
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:12,620
Goodbye, Grandpa.

178
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:13,170
Goodbye.

179
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:26,990
That's all you eat

180
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:29,860
every day,

181
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:32,610
Delicious.

182
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:33,460
It's nutritious.

183
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:36,880
You've suffered a lot, honey,

184
00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:39,600
What the heck?

185
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:50,820
Eat slowly.

186
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:52,130
No one is competing with you.

187
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,390
The scenery here is really nice.

188
00:10:57,350 --> 00:10:59,780
But I still like our terrace.

189
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:01,200
Where my wife is here,

190
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,410
the scenery is good everywhere.

191
00:11:04,310 --> 00:11:05,640
I've noticed that

192
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:07,640
you've been getting more glib lately.

193
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:09,400
Who told you to look better and better?

194
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:12,290
Tell me,

195
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,700
Who taught you to say that?

196
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:17,950
Why are you brothers again?

197
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:20,320
Drink, drink, drink.

198
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:31,130
(I'm at your gate. )

199
00:11:31,130 --> 00:11:32,010
(Come out. ),

200
00:11:34,850 --> 00:11:35,680
It's late.

201
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:37,680
I must have gone to bed.

202
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:39,490
That's right.

203
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,130
Didn't Grandpa tell you

204
00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:44,880
to handle the relationship

205
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,590
between you two?

206
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:48,910
And he's already at the door.

207
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:52,380
Why are you afraid to go?

208
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:54,350
Who wouldn't dare to go?

209
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:12,640
Xuanyi,

210
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:13,760
it's late.

211
00:12:14,430 --> 00:12:15,370
Can I help you?

212
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:17,340
Mr. and Mrs. Long

213
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:18,270
are in a good mood.

214
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:24,080
I'm really sorry about

215
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,040
what happened at the opening ceremony.

216
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:27,040
I'll find a way to clarify it as soon as possible.

217
00:12:28,130 --> 00:12:29,040
When?

218
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:29,960
How?

219
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,750
How to make up for the impact?

220
00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:33,600
Xuanyi,

221
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,860
if you want to do this,

222
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:37,100
I can tell you clearly

223
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:38,840
that night,

224
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:40,370
Jingmei and I will be together

225
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:42,160
for three days.

226
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:43,940
I'll give you an answer in three days.

227
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:45,720
I'm not here for you.

228
00:12:46,810 --> 00:12:47,720
I'm here to see her.

229
00:12:49,050 --> 00:12:50,300
I'm looking for you.

230
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,290
Otherwise, it would be nice if she sent you a text.

231
00:12:54,290 --> 00:12:55,980
Why do you have to send voice messages so that I can hear

232
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:01,520
and talk,

233
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:02,800
Okay.

234
00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:19,610
After such a big accident,

235
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,720
how can you still be so calm?

236
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:24,080
I don't know if you have a plan, do you?

237
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,690
Or do you really have a big heart?

238
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:31,260
(Deng Manfei's itinerary in the next three days)

239
00:13:33,290 --> 00:13:35,640
This is Deng Manfei's schedule for the next three days.

240
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:37,140
A friend of mine gave it to me.

241
00:13:41,610 --> 00:13:42,870
You know it's Deng Man Fei?

242
00:13:43,650 --> 00:13:44,870
It's a pity that I don't have any evidence,

243
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:47,060
so I can only try my luck.

244
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:48,130
Talk to her,

245
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:50,710
since she's trying to discredit you,

246
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:52,860
How can I make a deal with you?

247
00:13:53,570 --> 00:13:54,860
She always wants something,

248
00:13:56,310 --> 00:13:58,760
why don't you make a deal with me?

249
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:07,340
This is.

250
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:09,340
If I tell you,

251
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:10,960
I happened to take this photo.

252
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:11,740
Believe it or not?

253
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:16,380
I believe it.

254
00:14:22,950 --> 00:14:23,920
Let me add you on WeChat.

255
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,550
You're the one who gave me the evidence.

256
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:26,890
Let me send you the email.

257
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:29,640
But you haven't made a deal

258
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:31,640
with me yet?

259
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:35,610
Between the comrades in the same camp,

260
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:37,200
what are the conditions to negotiate?

261
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,520
Help each other?

262
00:14:39,930 --> 00:14:40,890
You help me?

263
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:42,890
Where did you get your confidence?

264
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,470
Are you coming to see me tonight?

265
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:47,470
Isn't it just to exchange this photo

266
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:49,360
for a favor?

267
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:52,700
I heard that you used to be the top student of Bencheng,

268
00:14:54,210 --> 00:14:56,220
as long as it's not about hurting Long Yi,

269
00:14:56,410 --> 00:14:57,840
I can promise to help you.

270
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:15,540
It hurts.

271
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:16,640
Are you okay?

272
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:23,500
Wish you two a harmonious union lasting a hundred years.

273
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:24,160
I'm leaving.

274
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:25,780
-Thank you. -No. -What are you talking about? Deng Man

275
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:31,410
Fei's problem

276
00:15:42,570 --> 00:15:44,130
has been solved.

277
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:45,460
Wait,

278
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:47,330
what have you two been doing in there?

279
00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:49,120
I didn't do anything.

280
00:15:50,010 --> 00:15:52,050
I really want to thank Chen Xuanyi this time.

281
00:15:52,730 --> 00:15:54,320
Your female brother,

282
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:57,710
right?

283
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:01,530
Let's go home.

284
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:18,440
Sis,

285
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:20,220
I'm just a reporter,

286
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:21,640
running news when I get news,

287
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,360
How can I have that kind of mind?

288
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,130
Why did you set up a trap against the Long family?

289
00:16:25,930 --> 00:16:26,820
That night,

290
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:28,610
I really got a message from Deng Man Fei.

291
00:16:28,610 --> 00:16:30,910
To film the scandal between her and Meng Hao's partner.

292
00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:32,430
I really don't know anything else.

293
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:35,240
Sis, if you want me to say anything else,

294
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:37,180
just tell me what you want to do?

295
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:38,330
What a coincidence.

296
00:16:38,850 --> 00:16:40,120
I wanted to ask you the same question,

297
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:41,960
What are you going to do

298
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,100
after the peep show is exposed?

299
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:44,950
Give me one week,

300
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:46,350
three days.

301
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:17,400
The original version has been deleted.

302
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,900
Keep it safe.

303
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:23,100
(The original version has been deleted. Save it with confidence. ).

304
00:18:58,490 --> 00:18:59,880
Honey,

305
00:19:02,410 --> 00:19:03,520
I'm hungry.

306
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:09,220
I'm hungry.

307
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:47,410
Where are we now?

308
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:51,750
Grandpa's house doesn't look like this,

309
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:53,860
is there a ghost?

310
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:56,310
Oh my goodness.

311
00:19:57,090 --> 00:19:58,600
Why is the signal so bad?

312
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:01,480
Isn't there a signal here?

313
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:05,100
(Long Yi)

314
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,080
Hey, honey,

315
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:08,180
Where have you been?

316
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:10,690
I … I got lost.

317
00:20:12,650 --> 00:20:13,630
Lost?

318
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:15,130
Why are you laughing?

319
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:17,440
Send me a location to share,

320
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:18,530
I can't share the blocked signal

321
00:20:18,530 --> 00:20:19,780
at home anymore,

322
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:21,780
Tell me where you are?

323
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:23,150
I'm in the yard,

324
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:26,160
but I can't find my way back.

325
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:27,390
Isn't there anything

326
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,560
in front of you in the yard?

327
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:33,130
There is a row of trees in front of me

328
00:20:33,530 --> 00:20:34,930
and a pavilion behind me,

329
00:20:34,930 --> 00:20:35,760
The pavilion is full of lights,

330
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:36,720
and there are many flowers,

331
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:38,720
Pavilion.

332
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:42,950
How about this?

333
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:45,070
I'll fire a flare gun

334
00:20:45,070 --> 00:20:46,100
into the sky. Look into the sky.

335
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:54,300
I saw it. I saw it.

336
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:56,690
You're the letter of the evening breeze.

337
00:20:57,990 --> 00:20:59,230
Honey,

338
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:01,380
Honey,

339
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:04,400
Honey,

340
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:06,450
thank you for your hard work.

341
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:09,560
To be honest, honey,

342
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:12,190
is it because the food is not good?

343
00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:13,370
You want to run away from home?

344
00:21:13,370 --> 00:21:14,770
Are you kidding me?

345
00:21:14,770 --> 00:21:16,080
I was scared to death.

346
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,040
I'm scared to death.

347
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:19,330
Let me do it,

348

Honey,

354
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:42,740
why do I wake up

355
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:45,180
in such a big house every day.

356
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:48,060
But you're not happy at all?

357
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:52,060
Because you wake up hungry every day.

358
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:58,540
Can we stop eating nutritious meals?

359
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,260
Uncle is such a good cook,

360
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:01,860
just let him do whatever he wants.

361
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:05,390
Grandpa has the final say

362
00:22:06,370 --> 00:22:08,070
in this family.

363
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:13,270
I want to order takeout.

I'm not a delivery guy.

373
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:36,200
I'm here to deliver the information.

374
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:38,040
Dressed like this,

375
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:39,500
you said you weren't a delivery guy,

376
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:40,530
Do you believe it yourself?

377
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:43,020
Sis,

378
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:44,120
They don't believe me?

379
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,590
Why don't you come out and take it away.

380
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,310
I'm running out of time.

if you go east,

385
00:22:53,050 --> 00:22:54,950
There is a big locust tree in the east.

386
00:22:54,950 --> 00:22:55,680
Did you see that?

387
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:57,270

Yes, I did.

391
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,180
Just put the takeout

392
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:03,920

What's going on, honey?

400
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:25,310
It's not me.

401
00:23:25,310 --> 00:23:26,510
I can't control it.

Sis,

404

Your takeout was detained by the security guard.

405

Tell me. It's better

406

Stop acting with me.

418
00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:11,860
It's not that you're not allowed to eat the takeout.

419

I want you to eat
