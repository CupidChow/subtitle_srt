1
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,759
I think this plan is feasible.

2
00:02:24,039 --> 00:02:24,560
Take a look.

3
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:25,879
Okay, I got it.

4
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:26,879
President Chen.

5
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:27,840
Everyone is here.

6
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:32,919
President Chen is here.

7
00:02:33,719 --> 00:02:34,719
In that case,

8
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,439
Then let's start.

9
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,439
It seems that Mr. Long has a problem

10
00:02:38,439 --> 00:02:39,240
I'm very interested.

11
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:40,560
Came to work in person.

12
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,120
Leader Liu.

13
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:44,719
Let's start.

14
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,400
Here's the thing, Team Leader Liu.

15
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:53,919
Don't worry about President Long.

16
00:02:54,599 --> 00:02:55,919
Although he doesn't come to work very often,

17
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:56,639
but

18
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,479
He can definitely keep up with the progress.

19
00:02:59,719 --> 00:03:00,120
Yes

20
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:02,520
this

21
00:03:02,759 --> 00:03:04,039
President Chen, in some ways,

22
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:05,520
Can still represent me.

23
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:07,280
Let's start.

24
00:03:08,039 --> 00:03:09,000
Mr. Long, President Chen.

25
00:03:10,199 --> 00:03:12,360
The direction of Long Mei Island's game plan.

26
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:12,680
Long Mei Island.

27
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:13,199
There are a few.

28
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:15,719
Chen Xuanyi

29
00:03:17,719 --> 00:03:19,319
Long Mei Island is my personal property.

30
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:20,000
What are you doing?

31
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:20,879
Really?

32
00:03:21,639 --> 00:03:22,479
You have to ask.

33
00:03:22,919 --> 00:03:24,560
Uncle Long and Aunt Yang

34
00:03:25,159 --> 00:03:26,479
They gave me the access.

35
00:03:30,759 --> 00:03:31,919
Leader Liu, continue.

36
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,199
Okay, I will continue.

37
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,240
wife

38
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,240
How are you, honey?

39
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:36,680
Chen Xuan Yi

40
00:04:36,839 --> 00:04:37,480
I'm telling you,

41
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:39,120
I didn't want to go to the company.

42
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,600
You insist on fixing the Omey box.

43
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,120
I told you.

44
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:42,480
Yes

45
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,560
And gave our Long Mei Island

46
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,160
Honey, what's wrong with you?

47
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:51,920
tired

48
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:56,800
It's all my fault.

49
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,920
I will pick you up from now on.

50
00:05:00,439 --> 00:05:00,959
No need

51
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:02,519
Then drive yourself.

52
00:05:03,639 --> 00:05:04,240
I'm lazy.

53
00:05:07,879 --> 00:05:08,480
Yes

54
00:05:09,319 --> 00:05:11,240
My wife is having an interview today.

55
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:12,800
I don't know which lucky one.

56
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:14,920
Won the favor of my wife.

57
00:05:19,079 --> 00:05:19,680
I don't want to talk.

58
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,120
If you don't want to talk, you can't.

59
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:24,199
The imperial sedan.

60
00:05:27,439 --> 00:05:28,160
The imperial sedan.

61
00:05:30,519 --> 00:05:30,879
go

62
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,240
Let's go.

63
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:34,959
husband

64
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:08,319
Why don't you blow on your hair?

65
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:09,480
The hair is hanging here.

66
00:06:10,959 --> 00:06:12,160
You will get a headache.

67
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:13,360
Haven't I told you?

68
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:30,839
husband

69
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:33,639
Did I get married early?

70
00:06:36,759 --> 00:06:37,560
What are you talking about?

71
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:40,079
I said,

72
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:43,040
It's great to marry you.

73
00:06:48,879 --> 00:06:49,480
wife

74
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,439
I might come up with a difference.

75
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:53,199
I can't see you for another week.

76
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:54,680
Where are you going?

77
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:57,560
Chen Xuanyi asked me to go to Long Mei Island with her.

78
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:00,800
What company? Get a broken box.

79
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,000
wife

80
00:07:04,519 --> 00:07:04,959
to feel relieved

81
00:07:05,439 --> 00:07:06,839
It's just work.

82
00:07:07,319 --> 00:07:07,759
work

83
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:13,560
I'm not going.

84
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:15,480
Go to the interview with my wife.

85
00:07:15,879 --> 00:07:16,959
No way

86
00:07:16,959 --> 00:07:18,199
Work is important, of course.

87
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,720
Why are you with me?

88
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:26,800
wife

89
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,199
In fact, sometimes work is a kind of fate.

90
00:07:29,879 --> 00:07:30,839
There's no need to be anxious.

91
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,079
Sometimes, for a change,

92
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:34,759
There will be unexpected gains.

93
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:36,519
Don't be nervous.

94
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:54,639
Good morning.

95
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,079
Dude,

96
00:07:57,079 --> 00:07:58,040
I can't be with you today.

97
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,240
I have serious business.

98
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:01,040
He will go too.

99
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,199
He will go too.

100
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:05,800
Please introduce him.

101
00:08:06,279 --> 00:08:08,120
This is President Long Chen Ji.

102
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,279
The owner of Long Mei Island.

103
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,519
This is Master Kitano.

104
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:13,480
The chief designer of Long Mei Island.

105
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,639
Master Kitano.

106
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:21,879
You have many titles.

107
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:22,920
It's none of your business.

108
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:24,240
what?

109
00:08:25,399 --> 00:08:26,240
You're willing to work today.

110
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,040
You are waiting for me to carry your luggage.

111
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:31,879
Help me carry the luggage.

112
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:33,679
I'm a guest.

113
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:35,080
you

114
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,240
Sometimes, for a change,

115
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,840
There will be unexpected gains.

116
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:47,799
Don't be nervous.

117
00:08:51,559 --> 00:08:52,759
Alright. Let's change.

118
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:56,840
Come here.

119
00:08:59,759 --> 00:09:00,279
Director Wang.

120
00:09:01,399 --> 00:09:02,159
Hello, Director Wang.

121
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,679
I'm Zhang Yiyi.

122
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,159
This is my resume.

123
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:10,320
Zhang Yiyi.

124
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:33,679
New guy, right?

125
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:37,240
What about

126
00:09:38,279 --> 00:09:38,799
I have some experience.

127
00:09:39,039 --> 00:09:39,480
Give it a try.

128
00:09:41,679 --> 00:09:42,679
Okay, let's try.

129
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:43,639
Thank you, Director Wang.

130
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,080
Long Yi.

131
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,039
Are you sure you want to leave Zhang Jingmei?

132
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:52,399
Are you going to Long Mei Island alone?

133
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:53,960
Aren't you afraid that Zhang Jingmei will find out?

134
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,080
I won't forgive you.

135
00:09:57,559 --> 00:09:59,000
Why don't you find another chance?

136
00:09:59,200 --> 00:09:59,960
Let's go together.

137
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:00,759
You're afraid of me.

138
00:10:00,799 --> 00:10:03,000
To interfere with your relationship with Chen Xuanyi, right?

139
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,080
Be quiet.

140
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:07,440
I'm serious this time.

141
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,600
Seriously.

142
00:10:12,519 --> 00:10:13,600
I'm warning you.

143
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:16,279
If you dare to treat Chen Xuan Yi badly,

144
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,360
I won't let you off first.

145
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,360
What are you doing?

146
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:23,600
Don't you want to take your luggage?

147
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,000
He's here.

148
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:26,480
shoot!

149
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:27,960
I forgot to call.

150
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,000
wife

151
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,039
I'm at the airport.

152
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:35,720
Where are you?

153
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:36,639
I

154
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,559
Jialin and I are drinking milk tea.

155
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:40,440
And drink milk tea.

156
00:10:40,519 --> 00:10:41,399
Okay, bye.

157
00:10:42,039 --> 00:10:42,799
I haven't finished yet.

158
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,159
Leave.

159
00:10:56,679 --> 00:10:57,600
Long Yi, where are you going?

160
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,240
Let's go, Xuan Yi.

161
00:11:06,679 --> 00:11:07,519
I'm always here.

162
00:11:07,639 --> 00:11:08,200
Don't worry about him.

163
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:08,840
Let's go.

164
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:09,799
Long Yi is

165
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,279
Is only reliable for one person.

166
00:11:13,559 --> 00:11:14,000
President Chen.

167
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,559
The check-in is done.

168
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:15,919
Come with me.

169
00:11:15,919 --> 00:11:16,679
Okay, let's go.

170
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:19,679
He will go too.

171
00:11:56,879 --> 00:11:57,799
Get out of the car.

172
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:38,879
Jingmei

173
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,519
Thank you so much this time.

174
00:12:40,519 --> 00:12:41,600
To give them such a good chance.

175
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,480
We also provide a training ground.

176
00:12:42,759 --> 00:12:43,679
What are you talking about?

177
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:45,120
I should thank you, okay?

178
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:46,399
The cast needs people urgently.

179
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:47,960
Only you.

180
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,039
So I can give you the code.

181
00:12:49,039 --> 00:12:50,840
You're a close friend.

182
00:12:52,679 --> 00:12:53,759
Come on, brothers.

183
00:12:54,519 --> 00:12:55,840
Everyone knows the plot.

184
00:12:55,919 --> 00:12:56,559
Time is limited.

185
00:12:56,759 --> 00:12:58,120
Everyone, hurry up and practice.

186
00:12:58,600 --> 00:12:59,240
Alright, sis.

187
00:12:59,240 --> 00:12:59,639
Don't worry.

188
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:00,080
no problem

189
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:14,480
The milk tea is too much.

190
00:13:24,559 --> 00:13:25,120
It's perfect.

191
00:13:25,559 --> 00:13:26,360
Open the door.

192
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:27,639
Open the door?

193
00:13:27,639 --> 00:13:28,879
This is a private place.

194
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:29,639
Don't make trouble.

195
00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:30,159
Leave now.

196
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,039
I know this is a private place.

197
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:33,080
I'm Long Yi.

198
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:33,879
I want you to open the door.

199
00:13:33,919 --> 00:13:34,600
Don't you understand?

200
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:35,960
What happened to Long Yi?

201
00:13:36,279 --> 00:13:37,480
I'm officially warning you.

202
00:13:37,759 --> 00:13:38,759
If you don't leave,

203
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,000
I'll call the police.

204
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:41,720
go

205
00:13:41,919 --> 00:13:42,759
You're very dutiful.

206
00:13:42,919 --> 00:13:43,720
You want to change your job?

207
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:44,320
Hurry up.

208
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:50,399
He kept knocking on the door.

209
00:13:50,559 --> 00:13:50,919
We can't let him in.

210
00:13:50,919 --> 00:13:51,360
Young Master Long.

211
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:52,399
What Young Master Long?

212
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:53,000
Hurry up.

213
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:54,480
Young Master Long.

214
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:55,039
This is Young Master Long.

215
00:13:55,039 --> 00:13:55,320
Young Master Long.

216
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:56,279
He didn't know it was you.

217
00:13:56,279 --> 00:13:57,600
Young Master Long, I've never seen you before.

218
00:13:57,799 --> 00:13:58,279
Young Master Long.

219
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,159
Zhang Jingmei

220
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:03,519
Young Master Long.

221
00:14:03,879 --> 00:14:04,840
Young Master Long, take it easy.

222
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:06,759
Young Master Long.

223
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:11,679
Young Master Long.

224
00:14:11,759 --> 00:14:12,519
Young Master Long.

225
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:14,200
I'm really sorry, Young Master Long.

226
00:14:14,759 --> 00:14:15,559
I didn't blame you.

227
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:17,559
Young Master Long, Young

228
00:14:17,679 --> 00:14:18,919
He's new here.

229
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:19,399
Don't blame him.

230
00:14:19,399 --> 00:14:20,200
Don't fire him.

231
00:14:20,519 --> 00:14:21,480
Give him another chance.

232
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:23,000
At ease, at attention.

233
00:14:23,759 --> 00:14:24,559
For two hours.

234
00:14:24,559 --> 00:14:25,120
yes

235
00:14:32,679 --> 00:14:33,720
Young Master Long, please wait.

236
00:14:35,919 --> 00:14:36,440
Open mine.

237
00:15:01,679 --> 00:15:02,240
hello

238
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,399
Welcome to Long Mei Island.

239
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:06,279
The environment is good.

240
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:09,320
Let's take a rest today.

241
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:10,519
We'll start work tomorrow.

242
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:11,879
President Chen.

243
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,600
We have three rooms for you.

244
00:15:13,799 --> 00:15:14,799
One room on the third floor.

245
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,240
There are two rooms on the second floor.

246
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:18,440
I don't know who lives on the third floor.

247
00:15:19,559 --> 00:15:20,480
The third floor has a nice view.

248
00:15:20,679 --> 00:15:21,240
With a broad vision.

249
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:22,480
Luo is always a guest.

250
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,120
Why don't you stay on the third floor?

251
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:27,039
The scenery on the second floor is equally good and open.

252
00:15:27,799 --> 00:15:28,159
Right?

253
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,120
You both live on the second floor.

254
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:30,919
I live on the third floor.

255
00:15:50,159 --> 00:15:50,759
Slow down.

256
00:15:54,159 --> 00:15:54,720
What?

257
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,440
I'll leave them to you.

258
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:00,240
Take care of it for me.

259
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:01,279
Don't worry.

260
00:16:01,399 --> 00:16:01,919
Get back to work.

261
00:16:02,679 --> 00:16:03,240
You kept it from me.

262
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:05,519
Yiyi.

263
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,480
Yiyi, you're back.

264
00:16:07,639 --> 00:16:08,480
The director is looking for you.

265
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:09,279
Then let's go.

266
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:10,440
Yiyi.

267
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:11,600
Come on.

268
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,039
Everyone, come with me.

269
00:16:13,159 --> 00:16:13,799
Come with me.

270
00:16:14,759 --> 00:16:15,559
Stay close behind.

271
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:16,720
Stay close behind.

272
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:17,720
to do sth more quickly

273
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:32,159
Mr. Luo,

274
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:33,000
Are you busy?

275
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:38,679
You know,

276
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:41,559
Everything is good on Long Mei Island.

277
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:43,440
But it's the same.

278
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,080
There are too few people.

279
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:47,840
Isn't this a private island?

280
00:16:48,159 --> 00:16:49,559
Has not been developed into a commercial island.

281
00:16:51,559 --> 00:16:52,399
So,

282
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:53,759
You know,

283
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,919
President Chen, as a girl,

284
00:16:56,879 --> 00:16:58,200
Let her live on the third floor alone.

285
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,440
Is it too dangerous?

286
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:04,000
If something happens,

287
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:05,559
We don't know.

288
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:07,039
Mr. Luo,

289
00:17:07,799 --> 00:17:08,599
Be frank with me.

290
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,240
Your room

291
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:15,559
Nice environment.

292
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:16,880
The lighting is good.

293
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:18,359
It's good.

294
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,079
Alright, Mr. Luo.

295
00:17:20,359 --> 00:17:21,000
I'll do it now.

296
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:25,680
You're really an excellent assistant.

297
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:28,839
sister

298
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,480
These are the two artists my sister brought.

299
00:17:30,599 --> 00:17:31,519
You have a good image.

300
00:17:32,279 --> 00:17:33,240
She has a good image.

301
00:17:33,799 --> 00:17:34,480
Smile.

302
00:17:37,759 --> 00:17:38,519
Sign it later.

303
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:39,200
Alright.

304
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,200
Then, Sister Busy,

305
00:17:42,079 --> 00:17:43,319
Zhang Yiyi.

306
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:47,759
Stand there.

307
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,359
I'll stand on a hammer.

308
00:17:50,279 --> 00:17:50,799
line up

309
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:53,880
Then it's hard.

310
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,359
Take care of these two newbies.

311
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:02,359
Come on.

312
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:03,920
Everyone, please sign your names.

313
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:05,480
Pass them on.

314
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:08,559
Everyone is here.

315
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:09,400
I know.

316
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,119
Take care of him.

317
00:18:10,119 --> 00:18:11,319
Okay, don't worry.

318
00:18:17,279 --> 00:18:17,680
to

319
00:18:18,759 --> 00:18:19,240
autograph

320
00:18:26,599 --> 00:18:27,559
What are you writing?

321
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:29,440
You think you're the best?

322
00:18:29,599 --> 00:18:30,559
How will I pay you later?

323
00:18:30,759 --> 00:18:31,319
What payment?

324
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:34,319
Look at the clear script.

325
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,000
Pay by name.

326
00:18:36,319 --> 00:18:36,920
You wrote this?

327
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:37,960
I'll jump there.

328
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:38,720
Change it.

329
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:42,960
to wait a moment

330
00:18:46,519 --> 00:18:46,960
I just came here.

331
00:18:49,799 --> 00:18:50,440
He's handsome.

332
00:18:51,079 --> 00:18:52,359
The styling is not good.

333
00:18:52,359 --> 00:18:53,160
To cover your face.

334
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:53,960
Change your style next time.

335
00:18:55,319 --> 00:18:55,799
Correct!

336
00:18:56,079 --> 00:18:57,039
When he dies later,

337
00:18:57,079 --> 00:18:57,920
Remember to face up.

338
00:18:58,119 --> 00:18:58,960
Stay closer to the main character.

339
00:19:00,359 --> 00:19:01,240
You will die later.

340
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:01,680
That's right.

341
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:03,079
Look at those two.

342
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:04,680
One is a group leader.

343
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:06,160
One is an actor and assistant director.

344
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,160
If you want to live well,

345
00:19:07,559 --> 00:19:09,359
We have to get close to them first.

346
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:11,000
Really?

347
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,559
Then the person whose name I called

348
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:16,400
Can you answer me?

349
00:19:17,599 --> 00:19:18,480
Sun Jingming.

350
00:19:18,519 --> 00:19:18,720

WangZhi

354
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:22,680
reach

357
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,039
Long Er.

358
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,640
Who is Long Er?

359
00:19:31,759 --> 00:19:32,200
No,

360
00:19:32,319 --> 00:19:33,359
There's no such two names.

361
00:19:37,519 --> 00:19:38,039
I

362
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:40,519
I'm Long Er.

363
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:52,759
Hello, Deputy Director Zhang Yi.

364
00:19:55,599 --> 00:19:56,480
I'm Long Er.

365
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,200
Please give me more advice.

366
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:04,440
Please give me more advice.

367
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:05,599
Come with me.

368
00:20:12,839 --> 00:20:13,680
Long Er.

369
00:20:14,119 --> 00:20:15,759
Didn't you go to Long Mei Island?

370
00:20:16,039 --> 00:20:16,640
Zhang Yiyi.

371
00:20:17,519 --> 00:20:20,200
Your milk tea is very nourishing this morning.

372
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:24,119
You followed me?

373
00:20:25,119 --> 00:20:26,000
joke

374
00:20:27,279 --> 00:20:29,200
My Dragon Master

375
00:20:30,759 --> 00:20:31,519
Will follow you.

376
00:20:32,279 --> 00:20:33,920
I followed my wife.

377
00:20:34,279 --> 00:20:35,079
Zhang Jingmei

378
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:38,440
Okay, it's my fault.

379
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:39,599
I shouldn't have kept it from you.

380
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,079
But I have my reasons.

381
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:43,839
What difficulties?

382
00:20:45,359 --> 00:20:46,599
Zhang Jingmei is Mrs. Long.

383
00:20:46,599 --> 00:20:48,400
This identity is too famous.

384
00:20:48,759 --> 00:20:50,319
The crew didn't dare to use me.

385
00:20:50,839 --> 00:20:51,599
Who dares to use it?

386
00:20:51,599 --> 00:20:52,279
Look, look.

387
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:53,640
Because of you.

388
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:54,880
They dare not use mine.

389
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,039
Then why do you have to let them use it?

390
00:20:58,839 --> 00:20:59,559
Yiyi.

391
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:00,559
The director is looking for you.

392
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:01,839
good

393
00:21:01,839 --> 00:21:02,720
I'll be there soon.

394
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:05,279
All right, I have to get back to work.

395
00:21:05,279 --> 00:21:05,960
Stop it.

396
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:06,599
Go back now.

397
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:07,559
Let's go home tonight.

398
00:21:07,559 --> 00:21:08,440
I'm not going back.

399
00:21:09,599 --> 00:21:10,200
Then what are you doing?

400
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:10,880
I'm acting.

401
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:13,160
You...

402
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:14,519
What happened to me

403
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:19,240
See that?

404
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:20,920
You passed the interview.

405
00:21:21,559 --> 00:21:22,039
See that?

406
00:21:22,359 --> 00:21:23,200
Oops.

407
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:27,200
Stop it, Young Master Long.

408
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:29,359
sorry

409
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:32,440
I

410
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:34,680
Is an actor.

411
00:21:43,519 --> 00:21:44,480
Mr. Luo, it's been a long time.

412
00:21:46,519 --> 00:21:46,839
Please sit down.

413
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:49,960
We are so close.

414
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:51,680
I still like to hear you calling me.

415
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:52,480
Beichen

416
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:54,160
Mr.Luo

417
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:57,480
I heard you're thoughtful for me.

418
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:59,039
You even changed rooms with me.

419
00:22:01,079 --> 00:22:02,720
It's proper to protect the beauty.

420
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:03,480
Moreover,

421
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,119
To protect you.

422
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,680
I won't be so hard on you.

423
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:09,599
But I have to warn you.

424
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:11,319
What about the third floor?

425
00:22:11,359 --> 00:22:12,559
Is slightly smaller than the second floor.

426
00:22:12,599 --> 00:22:13,519
I hope you don't mind.

427
00:22:14,359 --> 00:22:14,759
Don't mind.

428
00:22:17,279 --> 00:22:17,599
No

429
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,119
What do I care?

430
00:22:19,799 --> 00:22:20,960
Ming Zhe has sent the luggage

431
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,079
To your room.

432
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:23,640
This is your room card.

433
00:22:26,519 --> 00:22:27,720
I changed rooms with you.

434
00:22:28,519 --> 00:22:29,799
Isn't it Zhao Mingzhe's room?

435
00:22:30,519 --> 00:22:31,359
Ming Zhe will be here soon.

436
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,519
Brother Xu, calm down.

437
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:39,279
The executive director is in a hurry.

438
00:22:39,599 --> 00:22:41,160
To make a good film.

439
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:41,640
Right?

440
00:22:42,519 --> 00:22:43,000
Shoot it.

441
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,039
I didn't say I won't shoot.

442
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:47,119
Keep shooting.

443
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:48,440
Brother Xu.

444
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:49,880
to regret leaving

445
00:22:50,119 --> 00:22:51,519
Why don't you let Xu take a rest?

446
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:53,559
sister

447
00:22:53,799 --> 00:22:54,759
It's been two hours.

448
00:22:55,079 --> 00:22:55,640
Look, I'm an actress.

449
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:57,079
Are lying on the ground waiting.

450
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:57,720
Let's go.

451
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:00,240
Zhang Jingmei

452
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:00,720
Don't move.

453
00:23:01,119 --> 00:23:02,319
You're not acting.

454
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,200
What are you doing?

455
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,240
Didn't you see the strike?

456
00:23:05,599 --> 00:23:06,359
Leave them alone.

457
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:07,480
Just mind our own business.

458
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:08,000
No

459
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:09,599
What about Zhang Yiyi?

460
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,680
This is what Yiyi is eating.

461
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:12,559
If you really want her best,

462
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:13,480
Don't bother her.

463
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:14,359
If you move around,

464
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:15,559
She will be scolded later.

465
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:16,079
Namely

466
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:17,519
No

467
00:23:18,079 --> 00:23:18,960
Then you can look at it like this.

468
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:19,920
A big man bullied her.

469
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:22,319
You can't say that.

470
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,160
Everyone is doing their jobs.

471
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,480
Work.

472
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:27,720
What job?

473
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:29,240
What's the point?

474
00:23:30,079 --> 00:23:30,640
How many of you

475
00:23:31,079 --> 00:23:32,119
I've been lying here all morning.

476
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:32,960
Without a word.

477
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:33,519
Don't move.

478
00:23:33,519 --> 00:23:34,559
Tell me what the point is.

479
00:23:35,319 --> 00:23:35,920
Second Brother Long.

480
00:23:36,319 --> 00:23:37,599
We have a camera.

481
00:23:38,519 --> 00:23:39,000
That's right.

482
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:41,599
I played a corpse last time.

483
00:23:42,039 --> 00:23:42,680
But my mom

484
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,680
Or did you see me on the camera?

485
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,799
People should pursue their dreams when they are alive.

486
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:49,519
This is our dream.
