Chen Xuanyi

2
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:22,960
Chen Xuanyi

3
00:02:23,639 --> 00:02:24,159
Chen Xuanyi

4
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:30,919
Chen Xuan Yi, what do you mean?

5
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:32,000
Let's have dinner together tonight.

6
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:32,800
Find a place.

7
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:33,319
what

8
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,199
You think too much.

9
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:45,759
Zhang Dong Shuai

10
00:02:45,759 --> 00:02:46,719
Young lady, you're here.

11
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:48,719
That's right.

12
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:50,599
You have a strong sense of presence recently.

13
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:51,199
I

14
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,039
Stop playing games?

15
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:53,680
This...

16
00:02:54,199 --> 00:02:55,560
My sister asked me to help.

17
00:02:56,599 --> 00:02:57,560
What are you doing?

18
00:02:58,479 --> 00:02:59,360
This is our new stock.

19
00:02:59,639 --> 00:03:00,319
Chicken soup for convenience.

20
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:02,840
This milk tea shop

21
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:04,199
When did you sell chicken soup?

22
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:05,599
My brother-in-law recommended it.

23
00:03:06,039 --> 00:03:07,599
Is a must in our e-sports club.

24
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:08,599
It's delicious.

25
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:13,120
Thank you. Come again.

26
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:13,479
Little lady.

27
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:14,599
Leave me alone.

28
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:15,680
Get back to work.

29
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:16,560
Drink here?

30
00:03:16,639 --> 00:03:17,039
That's right.

31
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,360
It's such a big place.

32
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,280
Can you handle it alone?

33
00:03:19,639 --> 00:03:20,400
I'm sure.

34
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,479
You have to trust my speed.

35
00:03:21,479 --> 00:03:22,080
Professional

36
00:03:22,439 --> 00:03:23,240
There are so many people here.

37
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:24,879
Professional, okay?

38
00:03:26,719 --> 00:03:27,319
Little lady.

39
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,680
I'm contacting the manufacturer these two days.

40
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:31,400
My brother-in-law made a special order with them.

41
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,319
The Divine Formula Chicken Soup.

42
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,919
The service is only for my sister.

43
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,400
It tastes great.

44
00:03:36,759 --> 00:03:37,639
Your milk tea is ready.

45
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,039
Zhang Dong Shuai

46
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,159
Chen Mengyao

47
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:43,759
Classmate

48
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:45,159
More and more handsome.

49
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:47,919
This is your shop.

50
00:03:49,159 --> 00:03:50,120
My sister's shop.

51
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:52,240
Hello, sister.

52
00:03:53,159 --> 00:03:54,039
She's not my sister.

53
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,439
My sister is not her.

54
00:03:56,039 --> 00:03:56,879
She's...

55
00:03:58,840 --> 00:03:59,919
She's not my real sister.

56
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,080
Why are you so nervous?

57
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:03,639
I

58
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:05,919
Did you change your phone number?

59
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,400
Let's add a WeChat.

60
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:09,560
I added you several times before, but it didn't pass.

61
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,360
We can verify it in person.

62
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,560
No need.

63
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,479
I don't usually use WeChat.

64
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,000
Your milk tea.

65
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,199
You live like an old man.

66
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,240
What do you want?

67
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,120
I want a plain one.

68
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:23,600
Alright.

69
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,000
Make another cup.

70
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:25,879
good

71
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:26,600
I've added it.

72
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:29,759
She's gone, Meng Yao.

73
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:30,920
Let's go.

74
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,759
Thank you for my milk tea.

75
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:34,120
You're welcome.

76
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,240
Remember to reply me on WeChat.

77
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:37,959
Thank you.

78
00:04:38,439 --> 00:04:38,839
Thank you

79
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:46,319
What's wrong?

80
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:53,839
Morning, President Chen.

81
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:54,360
early

82
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:54,959
early

83
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,079
Morning, President Chen.

84
00:04:57,079 --> 00:04:57,759
Good morning.

85
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:01,759
Little lady.

86
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,279
What can I do for you?

87
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,120
The girl likes you.

88
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:07,240
That's right.

89
00:05:07,639 --> 00:05:08,360
Just friends.

90
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:09,920
I have nothing to do with her.

91
00:05:11,839 --> 00:05:12,399
Really

92
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:14,560
She used to be my deskmate.

93
00:05:14,839 --> 00:05:15,560
It's easier to talk.

94
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:18,600
She has a good personality.

95
00:05:19,399 --> 00:05:20,120
I'm familiar with everyone.

96
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:22,240
Look at you.

97
00:05:22,279 --> 00:05:23,360
And became nervous.

98
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,360
What's there to be nervous about?

99
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,040
You're a big man.

100
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,160
You're not a primary school student.

101
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:30,600
It's not puppy love.

102
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,879
It's natural for a man to be in love.

103
00:05:38,959 --> 00:05:40,120
What's up

104
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,600
I was touched by her.

105
00:05:44,079 --> 00:05:44,399
sister

106
00:05:47,879 --> 00:05:49,040
Can I be in love with you?

107
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:51,879
What are you talking about?

108
00:05:52,079 --> 00:05:53,079
I'm your sister.

109
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,920
She's not a real sister.

110
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,360
Although I often call you sister,

111
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:57,160
But the two of us

112
00:05:57,399 --> 00:05:59,360
But it's a pure relationship between man and woman.

113
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:01,120
You also said that

114
00:06:01,439 --> 00:06:03,600
It's natural for me to be in love.

115
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:04,959
sister

116
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,199
It's not small.

117
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,639
I really like you.

118
00:06:10,959 --> 00:06:11,839
To confess.

119
00:06:12,079 --> 00:06:12,319
That's right.

120
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:22,399
feed

121
00:06:25,639 --> 00:06:26,360
Where's Bowen?

122
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,120
I'll be there soon.

123
00:06:31,319 --> 00:06:32,120
This is yours.

124
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,360
Here you are.

125
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:34,800
Thank you

126
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:22,839
What's up

127
00:07:24,519 --> 00:07:25,160
to do sth more quickly

128
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,040
wife

129
00:07:27,439 --> 00:07:27,839
Wait

130
00:07:28,079 --> 00:07:29,199
Life is full of ups and downs.

131
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:32,920
You don't have to focus on success or failure.

132
00:07:33,879 --> 00:07:34,240
wife

133
00:07:34,879 --> 00:07:37,079
Now I understand.

134
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,279
I think the rest of the project

135
00:07:40,439 --> 00:07:41,120
No need.

136
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,199
You're thinking too much.

137
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,079
Your wife just wants to play.

138
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,279
Don't, honey.

139
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,000
go

140
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:54,600
Let's talk about it.

141
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,160
I really don't want to play.

142
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,040
Let's go.

143
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:06,120
Your side is so short.

144
00:08:07,959 --> 00:08:09,120
I'm on the high side. Go and have a look.

145
00:08:10,759 --> 00:08:11,360
is or isn't

146
00:08:12,439 --> 00:08:13,199
I'm going to your place.

147
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:17,399
Your face will be longer.

148
00:08:20,279 --> 00:08:21,600
I've learned a truth, honey.

149
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:22,480
what

150
00:08:22,959 --> 00:08:23,519
Sure enough

151
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,800
Life is not only ups and downs,

152
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:28,720
You will still be tall and fat.

153
00:08:29,079 --> 00:08:30,920
To become shorter and thinner.

154
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:34,519
I didn't think too much.

155
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,240
I came here when I was little.

156
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:38,720
Because this place is so interesting.

157
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,519
in one's childhood

158
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:43,120
I grew up with my grandma.

159
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,720
This is the place near my grandma's house.

160
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:48,360
But all the relatives there have passed away.

161
00:08:48,879 --> 00:08:50,679
I haven't been here for many years.

162
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:53,200
wife

163
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:54,879
I see.

164
00:08:55,799 --> 00:08:57,039
So you're here because of Grandma.

165
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,519
I miss you so much.

166
00:08:58,679 --> 00:08:59,559
So I came to play.

167
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:00,759
So I came here for my honeymoon.

168
00:09:01,039 --> 00:09:01,279
Right?

169
00:09:03,799 --> 00:09:04,679
The next project

170
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,240
I'm not a wife.

171
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,279
Tell me about it.

172
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:07,720
wife

173
00:09:09,679 --> 00:09:10,480
Thank you, Dong Jie.

174
00:09:10,879 --> 00:09:11,399
you're welcome

175
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:12,919
Does this work?

176
00:09:13,399 --> 00:09:14,200
I don't know either

177
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,279
Wait and see.

178
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,480
If your mother doesn't come,

179
00:09:17,679 --> 00:09:19,080
And do your homework at my place.

180
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:19,720
a row

181
00:09:21,039 --> 00:09:22,399
Okay, I got it.

182
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:26,639
You two, come here.

183
00:09:28,639 --> 00:09:29,000
Go ahead.

184
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,480
You're the same.

185
00:09:31,039 --> 00:09:31,600
Who copied who?

186
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:33,080
I copied it from Dong Jie.

187
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,360
You're very loyal.

188
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,399
Sir, I'm being honest.

189
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,440
To testify against me.

190
00:09:37,559 --> 00:09:38,840
He copied my homework.

191
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:40,799
You two study well.

192
00:09:40,879 --> 00:09:42,320
Why do you like to be invited?

193
00:09:42,799 --> 00:09:43,159
Bowen

194
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:44,440
What's wrong with Bowen?

195
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,440
Are you Hu Bowen's parents?

196
00:09:47,679 --> 00:09:48,200
That's right.

197
00:09:49,159 --> 00:09:50,120
Dong Jie, go back first.

198
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:51,200
Ask your father to come tomorrow.

199
00:09:54,639 --> 00:09:55,440
I called you here.

200
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:56,240
Mainly because

201
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,039
Hu Bowen's grades have dropped dramatically recently.

202
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,399
The total score is in the top 20 of the grade.

203
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,840
Now it's in the top two hundred.

204
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:03,759
Take a look for yourselves.

205
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:09,960
I'm sorry, sir.

206
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:10,919
Actually, Bowen

207
00:10:10,919 --> 00:10:12,240
Bowen is a good candidate.

208
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:12,879
I know.

209
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,080
So you don't have to say sorry to me.

210
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,840
You're sorry to the child.

211
00:10:17,799 --> 00:10:18,600
Over the years,

212
00:10:18,679 --> 00:10:20,360
You didn't come to the parents meeting.

213
00:10:20,559 --> 00:10:21,840
The sports meeting won't come.

214
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:24,120
Even all kinds of things in the class

215
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,279
None of you will attend.

216
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:26,879
What are you talking about?

217
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:27,639
Yes?

218
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,879
The works of Chinese film and TV circle

219
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,480
It's all covered by your family.

220
00:10:33,639 --> 00:10:34,240
That's right.

221
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,200
Sir, you're right.

222
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,159
Busy work is no excuse.

223
00:10:37,879 --> 00:10:39,320
I'm busy at work, so I have to find an excuse.

224
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:42,080
No matter the child's parents are not qualified to be parents.

225
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,840
You should disqualify them as parents.

226
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:44,639
Reheat

227
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,759
Don't be too excited.

228
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:47,799
I didn't mean that.

229
00:10:48,279 --> 00:10:50,440
I just saw that Hu Bo Wen was in a bad mood recently.

230
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:53,039
You don't care about your study at all.

231
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,519
You either dozed off or ran away during class.

232
00:10:55,639 --> 00:10:56,399
And didn't do my homework.

233
00:10:56,559 --> 00:10:57,679
And don't participate in group activities.

234
00:10:58,559 --> 00:10:59,519
I'm sorry, sir.

235
00:11:00,519 --> 00:11:03,200
Actually, Bowen is a very obedient child.

236
00:11:04,159 --> 00:11:05,960
The first thing to do is to do your homework.

237
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:06,919
And then something else.

238
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,240
Alright.

239
00:11:22,759 --> 00:11:24,000
To see you come together today.

240
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,120
It means the problem is not big.

241
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:27,519
And communicate with the kids at home.

242
00:11:27,559 --> 00:11:28,840
Okay, don't worry.

243
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,600
We must pay attention to

244
00:11:31,039 --> 00:11:31,879
Don't worry.

245
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,879
We must have a good communication with Bowen when we go back.

246
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:35,600
Okay, it's okay.

247
00:11:35,919 --> 00:11:37,399
Let's go back.

248
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:38,200
good

249
00:11:38,759 --> 00:11:39,360
Goodbye, teacher.

250
00:11:45,639 --> 00:11:46,080
Little Mum.

251
00:11:46,159 --> 00:11:47,960
I thought you didn't care about me.

252
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,080
You're right.

253
00:11:49,399 --> 00:11:50,679
Look, you got the wrong paper.

254
00:11:50,759 --> 00:11:51,480
It's all red.

255
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,240
I haven't found you yet.

256
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:54,320
Don't play games anymore.

257
00:11:54,799 --> 00:11:57,120
I won't miss my study if I play games.

258
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,840
If you don't enter the top 20,

259
00:11:58,840 --> 00:11:59,879
You can't play games.

260
00:12:00,679 --> 00:12:01,279
All right.

261
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,039
Let's talk at home.

262
00:12:02,759 --> 00:12:03,919
I want to eat a burger.

263
00:12:04,039 --> 00:12:05,399
How about going to KFC first?

264
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,519
How dare you ask me for a condition?

265
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:09,679
Listen to me.

266
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:13,000
Let's go.

267
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:18,039
wife

268
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,399
This place is so retro.

269
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,480
You grew up here?

270
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,080
That's right.

271
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,799
Grandma lives in the front.

272
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,679
And there's a little bell tower ahead.

273
00:12:25,799 --> 00:12:27,879
Opposite is a big bluestone stage.

274
00:12:28,279 --> 00:12:29,320
If you go out again,

275
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,600
To the arable land outside the village.

276
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:40,000
This tree has grown so tall.

277
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:40,600
this

278
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:45,399
Why is the tree so strange?

279
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:48,559
One year a typhoon blew down the tree.

280
00:12:48,919 --> 00:12:51,039
The villagers thought the tree would not survive.

281
00:12:51,559 --> 00:12:53,799
I didn't expect you to grow so well now.

282
00:12:54,279 --> 00:12:56,159
You can even survive.

283
00:12:57,039 --> 00:12:58,399
Although the tree is down,

284
00:12:58,759 --> 00:13:00,159
As long as it is deeply rooted,

285
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:02,000
It can still be alive.

286
00:13:02,759 --> 00:13:03,799
That's what grandma said.

287
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,240
to make sense

288
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:10,080
wife

289
00:13:12,279 --> 00:13:13,039
I'm thirsty.

290
00:13:20,039 --> 00:13:21,039
What are you looking for?

291
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,879
This is the basic skill of Taekwondo.

292
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:24,759
Try it.

293
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:27,200
It can quench your thirst more than water.

294
00:13:32,039 --> 00:13:33,480
Honey,

295
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:34,639
This...

296
00:13:35,159 --> 00:13:36,879
This melon is not stolen.

297
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,720
It's not stealing.

298
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:39,919
This is my grandma's house.

299
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:40,919
He's not an outsider.

300
00:13:41,879 --> 00:13:42,200
Really

301
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:43,759
Really

302
00:13:43,879 --> 00:13:45,960
When I was young, the residents of our area

303
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,840
Every family will grow watermelons.

304
00:13:47,879 --> 00:13:48,919
It's casual.

305
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:49,879
Sometimes I can't finish it.

306
00:13:49,879 --> 00:13:51,200
It will be wasted if it rotted in the ground.

307
00:13:58,799 --> 00:13:59,200
sweet

308
00:14:02,799 --> 00:14:04,639
This melon has a round head and a deep base.

309
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:05,879
It looks like a female melon.

310
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:06,679
It must be sweet.

311
00:14:11,679 --> 00:14:12,919
The watermelons are divided into male and female.

312
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,080
There are so many knowledge about watermelons.

313
00:14:15,879 --> 00:14:16,519
What are you doing?

314
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,279
Who is that?

315
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:19,840
Do you know him?

316
00:14:21,919 --> 00:14:22,639
I don't know.

317
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:23,919
to run fast

318
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,759
Don't run away.

319
00:14:47,639 --> 00:14:48,360
I heard that

320
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:50,360
When the typhoon hit, the sea water flowed back.

321
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:51,879
The fields are destroyed.

322
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,519
You can't grow any food.

323
00:14:54,679 --> 00:14:57,279
Everyone feels that the land is gone and the home is gone.

324
00:14:57,399 --> 00:14:58,320
And lost hope.

325
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,600
But after a few years,

326
00:15:00,759 --> 00:15:02,559
Can grow such a delicious watermelon.

327
00:15:02,799 --> 00:15:03,840
You said God is not magic.

328
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,559
Amazing, amazing.

329
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:07,720
wife

330
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:11,240
Thank you for taking me to this amazing place.

331
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:12,840
come

332
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:14,120
Cut a melon.

333
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,720
Cut you off.

334
00:15:24,919 --> 00:15:25,399
wife

335
00:15:25,879 --> 00:15:27,720
Your consumption is so low.

336
00:15:27,879 --> 00:15:29,519
Can you make money?

337
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,120
The price is low.

338
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,720
The cost of opening a shop is low.

339
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:35,639
I think the rent is only tens of thousands a year.

340
00:15:36,679 --> 00:15:38,559
If it's cheap enough,

341
00:15:38,559 --> 00:15:39,679
If you're down to earth,

342
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:41,240
You can usually earn it.

343
00:15:42,879 --> 00:15:43,919
That makes sense.

344
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:47,279
We still need to start with low-cost projects.

345
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:53,840
Opening sale, free hairdressing.

346
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,519
And sent laundry powder.

347
00:15:55,799 --> 00:15:58,120
Don't miss it when you pass by.

348
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:01,320
Opening sale, free hairdressing.

349
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:03,480
This way, aunt.

350
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:04,399
This way.

351
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:11,759
Now,

352
00:16:12,039 --> 00:16:13,200
It's already past time.

353
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,440
To fight alone.

354
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,399
You must have your own partner.

355
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:17,960
Open your eyes.

356
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,039
Integrating resources

357
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,120
Seize the chance.

358
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:22,960
Look, I've made a history drama.

359
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,120
Contention of a hundred schools of thought

360
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,600
And the S-Men Doctor.

361
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,639
They are the best team.

362
00:16:28,879 --> 00:16:30,000
The top match.

363
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,279
Can we win or not?

364
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:34,399
Jingmei, don't worry.

365
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,600
I will make the best team for you.

366
00:16:37,679 --> 00:16:38,639
Either we don't do it,

367
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,679
It's a big hit.

368
00:16:43,039 --> 00:16:44,360
What about your talent and ability?

369
00:16:44,559 --> 00:16:45,360
Don't worry.

370
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:46,879
As long as you put your heart into it,

371
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:49,519
Let go and take your photos.

372
00:16:49,879 --> 00:16:50,960
Leave the rest to you.

373
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:53,159
I can handle it for you.

374
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:54,960
Thank you, sister.

375
00:16:55,159 --> 00:16:56,399
But our project

376
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:58,000
It hasn't been selected yet.

377
00:17:03,919 --> 00:17:04,799
Sorry

378
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:05,839
Keep talking.

379
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:08,440
I'm not afraid of the project.

380
00:17:08,599 --> 00:17:10,599
With Zhang Jingmei standing here,

381
00:17:10,839 --> 00:17:12,799
Are you worried about a good project?

382
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,240
We're only working on the original script.

383
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,279
So I took hundreds of them.

384
00:17:15,319 --> 00:17:17,359
Plus the IP novels I found,

385
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:18,119
Brain hole setting.

386
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:19,599
There are so many projects.

387
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:22,160
There are some good projects.

388
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:24,240
But we haven't made the final decision yet.

389
00:17:24,519 --> 00:17:26,279
I will finish these projects as soon as possible.

390
00:17:26,279 --> 00:17:26,960
Sister, don't worry.

391
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:27,519
a row

392
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,599
Are serious people.

393
00:17:29,759 --> 00:17:31,119
We will definitely succeed.

394
00:17:31,599 --> 00:17:32,319
Good cooperation.

395
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:34,839
Good cooperation.

396
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:07,400
Hello, hello.

397
00:18:08,039 --> 00:18:09,240
Hello, Mr. Yu.

398
00:18:09,559 --> 00:18:10,720
Do you want a private theater?

399
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:10,960
Yes

400
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:12,960
Which theater are you from?

401
00:18:13,279 --> 00:18:14,359
We're Xinjiao Studio City.

402
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:15,799
This is the Giant Screen Cinema of Wu County.

403
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:16,319
Do you know

404
00:18:17,599 --> 00:18:19,839
It's too far.

405
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:21,119
Although we are far away,

406
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:22,319
But it's cheap here.

407
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:23,680
The price can be discussed.

408
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:26,079
How cheap is it?

409
00:18:27,599 --> 00:18:29,160
No.32 can come in.

410
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:30,759
Number 32, anyone?

411
00:18:31,799 --> 00:18:32,279
I...

412
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,200
I'll be there on the 32nd.

413
00:18:34,319 --> 00:18:36,160
You have too few beds.

414
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:38,839
That's right. When will it be?

415
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:40,680
Sisters and aunts,

416
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:41,680
Don't worry.

417
00:18:42,519 --> 00:18:44,640
I'm working overtime today.

418
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:46,119
I will definitely make it for you.

419
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,200
I have to pick up my grandson later.

420
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,359
It's too late.

421
00:18:49,559 --> 00:18:49,920
How about this?

422
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,160
Give me a bag of laundry powder.

423
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,079
I'll quit.

424
00:18:52,079 --> 00:18:52,519
aunt

425
00:18:52,519 --> 00:18:55,759
Our laundry powder is only delivered after being made by others.

426
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:56,599
If you don't,

427
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,359
Isn't it hard for me?

428
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:01,559
You're so handsome.

429
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,920
Don't be so stubborn in business.

430
00:19:04,039 --> 00:19:05,640
I have to buy food and cook later.

431
00:19:06,039 --> 00:19:07,200
I can't wait.

432
00:19:07,559 --> 00:19:08,799
That's right.

433
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,160
For three hours for a bag of washing powder.

434
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:12,759
It's so unworthy.

435
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:14,400
young man

436
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:16,000
Aren't you free?

437
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:17,960
Why don't you make it for me?

438
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:19,799
I

439
00:19:19,799 --> 00:19:20,119
That's right.

440
00:19:20,119 --> 00:19:21,160
Can I...

441
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,720
Why aren't you working?

442
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,960
President Wang is urging me again.

443
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,599
If you can't finish it today,

444
00:19:36,839 --> 00:19:38,279
You have to pay the penalty tomorrow.

445
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:39,759
It's not important.

446
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:42,599
He's our biggest client.

447
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:45,480
It's not important.

448
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,079
Brother, are you all right?

449
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:51,559
Have you got anything to do

450
00:19:53,599 --> 00:19:54,799
Help me go to the Ocean Love Restaurant.

451
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:55,319
Book two seats.

452
00:19:58,319 --> 00:19:59,279
About President Wang?

453
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:04,319
The Love of the Sea.

454
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,640
Is it appropriate to ask President Wang?

455
00:20:08,359 --> 00:20:09,359
It's Zhao Mingzhe.

456
00:20:12,519 --> 00:20:14,079
Get out of here. I'll make my own decision.

457
00:20:18,319 --> 00:20:19,240
The taste has changed again.

458
00:20:20,359 --> 00:20:21,319
Goodbye, President Chen.

459
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:21,920
OK

460
00:20:28,079 --> 00:20:28,359
President Chen.

461
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:30,079
Mr. Li said that he wants to have dinner with you tonight.

462
00:20:30,759 --> 00:20:31,160
Did you push it?

463
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:33,799
He has asked you out twice.

464
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,000
You told him to talk to the company.

465
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:37,599
a row

466
00:20:40,119 --> 00:20:40,559
Mingzhe

467
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,799
In the future,

468
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,000
You don't have to help me with my work.

469
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:46,640
Let's call it a day.

470
00:20:48,039 --> 00:20:49,119
President Chen, it's only half past six.

471
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:50,240
Leave work

472
00:21:24,279 --> 00:21:26,759
Hello, uncle.

473
00:21:31,319 --> 00:21:32,160
What's wrong with him?
