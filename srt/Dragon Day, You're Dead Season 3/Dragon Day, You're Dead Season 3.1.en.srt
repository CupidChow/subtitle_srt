337
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:02,030
Jialin,

338
00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:03,130
can you be gentle?

339
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:04,290
What are you doing?

340
00:16:04,290 --> 00:16:05,900
Every time you're with a little girl,

341
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:07,240
If you don't answer your phone or reply to WeChat,

342
00:16:07,410 --> 00:16:08,850
you've completely forgotten that you still have a girlfriend,

343
00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:09,850
right? Yu Haoqiu.

344
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:11,850
It's not Jingmei. It's Bai Yueguang,

345
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:15,130
my junior sister.

346
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:16,310
Ah

347
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,160
Bai Jialin Let me explain,

348
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,450
I'm officially informing you now,

349
00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:20,980
we're going to disband.

350
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,340
From now on,

351
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:23,550
you're my ex-boyfriend.

352
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:25,460
Five years of love is a waste of my time,

353
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:27,020
so please disappear from me.

354
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:28,400
-No! -Jialin, listen to me! Shut

355
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:28,750
up!

356
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:29,390
Is there

357
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:31,000
any misunderstanding?

358
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:31,490
Shut up, too!

359
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:34,030
Jingmei has nothing to do with you.

360
00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:35,040
Don't think too much.

361
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:36,470
I didn't think much about it.

362
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:37,200
Then … Then … Senior, my boyfriend is waiting

363
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,480
for me.

364
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:39,380
I'll get going.

365
00:16:42,050 --> 00:16:43,790
Jialin has a boyfriend.

366
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:47,030
Jialin. Jialin. Jialin. Jialin.

367
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:47,660
Don't follow me.

368
00:16:53,330 --> 00:16:54,360
I'm really hungry.

369
00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:02,670
Did we miss something?

370
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:05,280
It seems that the story is quite complicated.

371
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:06,580
Let's go.

372
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:08,150
Here, take it.

373
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:09,500
Take it.

374
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:15,050
Let's go.

375
00:17:15,650 --> 00:17:18,020
Do you think Brother Long has calmed down?

376
00:17:18,770 --> 00:17:20,660
I'm more worried if sister-in-law has calmed down.

377
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:25,510
Why is it like this?

378
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:28,270
It hurts.

379
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:31,950
Not only did I screw up my interview,

380
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:33,560
but I also hurt my senior.

381
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:36,560
Xiaoxiao, what should I do?

382
00:17:43,950 --> 00:17:45,620
I won't blame you.

383
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,280
Besides, there are plenty of opportunities

384
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,450
for interviews.

385
00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:50,260
Life is full of ups and downs,

386
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:52,570
you're going to be lucky.

387

(Luo Xiaoxiao, Zhang Jingmei's classmate and best friend at Bencheng College)

388

(Disappeared in everyone's field of vision after graduation)

389

Luo Xiaoxiao,

you

391
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:11,950
…-What do you think? -Is this you?

392
00:18:13,010 --> 00:18:13,540
Look,

393
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:15,220
how is

394
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:15,860
Korea doing?

395
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,300
Isn't it fun?

396
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:22,990
But I'm so sad. I've always been like this

397
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,460
since I graduated.

398
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:27,240
It's okay.

399
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:29,890
Zhou Shuo joined the investment bank,

400
00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:31,610
and he's so arrogant.

401

She keeps her mouth shut about finance,

402
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:37,620
who got into Aniubaba?

403
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:39,290
It is said that the salary is quite high.

404
00:18:39,290 --> 00:18:40,840
And Li Chuan,

405
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,760
he went to the postgraduate entrance examination.

406
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:45,980
Xing Mengqi went back to his hometown

to become a civil servant,

408
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:48,000
By the way,

Han Yihe,

410
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,440
She went to Korea to become a love idol.

411
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:56,890
Does this mean that everyone is doing the same thing?

412
00:18:56,890 --> 00:18:58,850
It means everyone is good, okay?

413
00:18:58,850 --> 00:19:00,430
Not as good as you.

414
00:19:01,050 --> 00:19:02,480
Don't you have Long Yi?

415
00:19:02,650 --> 00:19:04,270
He pissed me off.

416
00:19:05,090 --> 00:19:05,910
How could it be?

417
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:07,890
Long Yi is handsome, rich,

418
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:08,960
and single-minded to you,

419
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:11,800
A fairy couple envied by so many people?

420
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,010
Jingmei,

421
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:24,680
don't you see any change in me?

422
00:19:29,030 --> 00:19:29,620
What's wrong with your hand?

423
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:30,840
What do you think?

424
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:34,710
Ring finger,

Yes.

427
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:38,670
Are you crazy?

428
00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:40,220
We just graduated a few days ago,

429
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:41,350
and you got married.

430
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:44,300
I've prepared the invitation.

431
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:45,650
Send me a red envelope then.

432
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:55,750
Eldest son,

433
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:56,960
class is over.

434
00:19:57,510 --> 00:19:58,370
I'll be right there.

435
00:19:58,780 --> 00:19:59,620
Wait for me.

436
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:00,580
Good boy. Good boy.

437
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:07,040
I have to pick up my son.

438
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:08,400
If you have nothing to do,

439
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,400
go back early.

440
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:12,690
You changed your identity so quickly.

441
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:15,790
My son is so handsome.

442
00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:21,940
Jingmei,

443
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:24,100
if Hu is in a new play,

444
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:25,760
I'm the first to recommend you to join the team.

445
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:27,940
I believe you can do it.

446
00:20:28,370 --> 00:20:28,870
Come on!

447
00:20:32,650 --> 00:20:34,480
Say thank you to Director Hu for me.

448
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:43,810
One person will do things and one person will do it.

449
00:20:43,810 --> 00:20:45,410
Zhang Jingmei, you can do it.

450
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:47,690
Can I?

451
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:05,740
director

452
00:21:09,930 --> 00:21:11,260
Director, I didn't see anything.

453
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:12,060
You are not allowed to leave.

454
00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:14,300
What... What do you want to do?

455
00:21:14,790 --> 00:21:15,520
Don't worry,

456
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:16,690
there's no media here,

457
00:21:16,690 --> 00:21:17,800
If the driver leaves,

458
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:19,010
we won't be able to explain it clearly.

459
00:21:19,150 --> 00:21:20,020
I

460
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:21,590
… Director, should I leave or not?

461
00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:23,190
Stay.

462
00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:31,090
I'm here to apologize.

463
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:36,360
No need for that.

464
00:21:36,930 --> 00:21:37,550
You can leave.

465
00:21:37,550 --> 00:21:38,020
No.

466
00:21:39,030 --> 00:21:40,790
First of all, for the misunderstanding that happened this morning,

467
00:21:40,790 --> 00:21:41,970
I'd like to apologize to you.

468
00:21:42,630 --> 00:21:43,760
I'm sorry,

469
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:47,080
director. It was all a misunderstanding.

470
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:48,560
Just explain it clearly.

471
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:49,340
Also.

472
00:21:53,490 --> 00:21:54,500
This is my boyfriend.

473
00:21:54,790 --> 00:21:56,000
We love each other very much,

474
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,140
so I don't want to

475
00:21:57,140 --> 00:21:58,050
stir up gossip with you at all,

476
00:21:58,050 --> 00:21:59,100
You really misunderstood.

477
00:21:59,230 --> 00:22:00,480
Don't listen to Yu Haoqiu's nonsense.

478
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:01,490
Please hear me out.

479
00:22:01,490 --> 00:22:02,640
You don't have to use me,

480
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,500
But please don't blame him.

481
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:05,250
It has nothing

482
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:06,420
to do with him.

483
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:09,010
He wanted to help me out of kindness.

484
00:22:10,990 --> 00:22:12,910
I hope you have plenty of them.

485
00:22:12,910 --> 00:22:14,400
Your Excellency doesn't care about

486
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:16,410
villains. -Zhang. -Wait a minute,

487
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:18,470
I'm really not interested in you.

488
00:22:19,210 --> 00:22:20,090
Don't get me wrong.

489
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:21,400
Goodbye.

490
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:25,340
Sorry, director,

491
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:28,190
Zhang Jingmei,

492
00:22:28,190 --> 00:22:29,420
You can do it. Don't be weak.

493
00:22:29,770 --> 00:22:31,240
You can do it. Don't be weak.

494
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:32,400
Guys,

495
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:35,010
it seems like this is a big deal.

496
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:38,560
You won't break up, will you?

497
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:40,310
Pei pei pei.

498
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:41,730
What are you talking about?

499
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,560
I can't guarantee it.

500
00:22:50,650 --> 00:22:51,550
This time, my brother

501
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:53,760
really embarrassed my sister-in-law.

502
00:22:55,470 --> 00:22:56,140
No,

503
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:57,490
I think this sister-in-law,
