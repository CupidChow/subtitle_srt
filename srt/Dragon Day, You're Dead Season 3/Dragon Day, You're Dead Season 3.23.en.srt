00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:31,599
The timing is perfect.

Chen Xuanyi

3
00:02:38,919 --> 00:02:39,520
Happy birthday

4
00:02:44,199 --> 00:02:45,719
Master Kitano asked me to give you a message.

5
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:47,159
he

6
00:02:48,439 --> 00:02:49,159
Likeyou

7
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,199
Chen Xuanyi

8
00:02:55,439 --> 00:02:56,840
I will never leave you.

9
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:06,479
Who is it?

10
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:14,800
Hello

11
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,560
Someone said that

12
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:17,800
To the Great Commander.

13
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,680
You can grant me any request.

14
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:23,240
I don't know if we can cash it now.

15
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:25,159
What are your requirements?

16
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,159
I just want to see your smile.

17
00:03:34,199 --> 00:03:35,080
Commander is looking at you.

18
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,199
Is that what you want?

19
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:42,439
I just want to see your smile.

20
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:44,960
Every smile of yours

21
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:27,480
What's the smell?

22
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:29,639
wife

23
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:35,759
Zhang Jingmei

24
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,199
Zhang Jingmei

25
00:05:55,279 --> 00:05:56,160
Are you awake?

26
00:05:56,959 --> 00:05:57,920
The smell

27
00:05:59,319 --> 00:06:00,399
Could it be that

28
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:01,680
Spiral Lion Powder.

29
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:02,000
Try it.

30
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:02,279
Do not

31
00:06:04,079 --> 00:06:04,920
In the middle of the night,

32
00:06:05,879 --> 00:06:06,879
Why are you cooking it?

33
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,839
You cooked too little.

34
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:11,560
He didn't have enough to eat.

35
00:06:17,879 --> 00:06:19,720
I'll get you something to eat.

36
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:21,439
Don't come.

37
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,360
Have a taste.

38
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,120
Don't come.

39
00:06:32,439 --> 00:06:34,000
And smelled and smelled.

40
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:35,800
Stay away from me.

41
00:06:37,319 --> 00:06:40,040
You're always scared the first time.

42
00:06:40,279 --> 00:06:41,360
Just try a few more times.

43
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,000
Be brave.

44
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:43,680
One half.

45
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:44,199
It's impossible.

46
00:06:44,199 --> 00:06:46,439
It's impossible.

47
00:07:32,079 --> 00:07:33,560
No nosebleed.

48
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:35,040
Why did you stuff your nose?

49
00:07:35,319 --> 00:07:37,319
Stop sleeping.

50
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:42,399
My nostrils are too big.

51
00:07:42,399 --> 00:07:44,240
Why did you stuff your nose?

52
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:54,759
What's up

53
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,120
Why?

54
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,759
The Spiral Lion Noodles,

55
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,240
You almost sent me away.

56
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,600
It's been a night.

57
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,759
And the taste is gone.

58
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:13,160
Smell it.

59
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:18,720
I can only smell the faint fragrance of flowers.

60
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:24,240
It's like a big chamomile.

61
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,560
Bloom in the sunshine.

62
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,279
Since when do we have chamomile?

63
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:33,720
That's because I found an air cleaner.

64
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:36,399
Air and cleaning?

65
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,240
Why didn't you say you were dreaming?

66
00:08:39,759 --> 00:08:40,200
I

67
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:42,440
Where are you going?

68
00:08:42,759 --> 00:08:43,360
So hungry.

69
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,279
To get food.

70
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:45,360
You ate so much last night.

71
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,120
Are you still eating?

72
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:49,120
Don't cook the powder.

73
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:13,559
I'm sorry.

74
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,200
it doesn't matter

75
00:09:24,559 --> 00:09:25,279
Secretary Zhao.

76
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:28,879
to let sb down

77
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:30,759
it doesn't matter

78
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,919
To protect the theme of love.

79
00:09:32,919 --> 00:09:33,639
I like it so much

80
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:34,600
Thank you.

81
00:09:39,759 --> 00:09:41,080
I've been with President Chen for seven years.

82
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,240
It's the first time I saw her distracted at work.

83
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:48,840
Mr. Kitano,

84
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,639
I hope you can live up to this position.

85
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:09,399
I used to shop here with my mom.

86
00:10:09,799 --> 00:10:11,799
This place is so tasty.

87
00:10:12,519 --> 00:10:13,200
Buy some fruit.

88
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,399
Don't look around.

89
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:16,360
What are they selling?

90
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,200
Selling seafood.

91
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,080
We'll have a look later.

92
00:10:20,159 --> 00:10:21,120
I'll buy the dishes.

93
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,320
To buy food?

94
00:10:22,799 --> 00:10:23,559
What to buy?

95
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:24,799
Boss

96
00:10:24,799 --> 00:10:25,720
How much is this?

97
00:10:26,039 --> 00:10:26,759
This is cheap.

98
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:27,120
a row

99
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,279
Then you can weigh some for me.

100
00:10:28,279 --> 00:10:28,519
Alright, alright.

101
00:10:28,519 --> 00:10:29,000
Boss

102
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,360
Why are there so many of them?

103
00:10:31,799 --> 00:10:32,840
A pile of three yuan.

104
00:10:34,039 --> 00:10:34,639
Three yuan.

105
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:36,440
It's cheap.

106
00:10:36,799 --> 00:10:37,679
A bunch of you.

107
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:38,759

00:10:41,039 --> 00:10:42,600
Five yuan, two piles.

pretend

111
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,039
Come on.

112
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,240
These are delicious.

113
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:54,679
Thank you

114
00:10:54,679 --> 00:10:55,679
Go back and eat.

115
00:10:55,679 --> 00:10:56,279
Take care.

116
00:10:56,279 --> 00:10:56,960
This is so cheap.

117
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:57,279
Alright.

118
00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:57,799
husband

119
00:10:57,799 --> 00:10:59,000
What are you doing?

120
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,080
A pile of three yuan.

121
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,000
It's cheap.

122
00:11:01,159 --> 00:11:01,840
young man

123
00:11:02,039 --> 00:11:03,279
The cane is dewy.

124
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:04,240
It's so sweet.

125
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,039
Ten yuan for a bundle.

126
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:05,600
A bunch of them.

127
00:11:07,799 --> 00:11:08,919
Thank you, aunt.

128
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:09,679
See you later!

129
00:11:09,679 --> 00:11:10,159
Slow down.

See you later, aunt.

131
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,000
Thank you, aunt.

132
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:13,840
Don't you think it's heavy?

133
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:14,200
Nothing

134
00:11:16,879 --> 00:11:18,279
Dinner is ready.

135
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:21,600
Slow down. It smells good.

136
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,399
It's hot.

137
00:11:22,759 --> 00:11:23,240

00:11:28,519 --> 00:11:29,480
Only noodles.

140
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,159
It's hard to serve.

141
00:11:48,799 --> 00:11:49,480
Eat it.

142
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:50,679
Alright.

143
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:57,399
fragrant

144

It smells so good.

145
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,399
Is the most unique in the universe.

146
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,200
Your acting is too fake.

147
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:03,960
Have some eggs.

148
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:19,279
Yummy

149
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:20,919
It's delicious.

150
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:22,480
Eat slowly.

151
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,480
It's all yours.

152
00:12:27,159 --> 00:12:28,200
This wife married

Have some more.

155
00:12:33,159 --> 00:12:33,960
Come on. Eat it too.

156

wife

157
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:51,840
What are you doing, honey?

158
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,600
Before putting it in the microwave,

159
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:57,679
Remember to open the cover.

160
00:12:58,679 --> 00:12:59,679
You won't come back for dinner.

161
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:01,360
What if?

162
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,720
I'm afraid I will be late.

163
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,000
To make you hungry?

164
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:06,840
I suspect

165
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,519
You have premeditated.

166
00:13:09,879 --> 00:13:11,480
Put it in the microwave for 30 seconds.

167
00:13:11,639 --> 00:13:12,039
Will I?

168
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:12,960
can't

169
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:15,559
If you can't,

170
00:13:15,559 --> 00:13:17,120
So I ordered takeout.

171
00:13:17,799 --> 00:13:18,759
No, I don't.

172
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:23,159
There are chicken soup and spiral lion powder in the cabinet.

173
00:13:23,159 --> 00:13:24,279
Eat it yourself.

174

wife

175
00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:30,320
I

176
00:13:30,879 --> 00:13:33,279
To have lunch on the crew with you.

177
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,039
Young Master Long.

178
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:37,200
Please leave Yiyi alone.

179
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:37,840
wife

180
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:38,600
It's not me.

181
00:13:38,799 --> 00:13:40,159
I can act as a group.

182
00:13:40,559 --> 00:13:41,159
Second Brother Long.

183
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,480
Find another way out.

184
00:13:45,919 --> 00:13:47,039
Don't.

185
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:48,759
Not a wife.

186
00:14:04,759 --> 00:14:05,480
Thank you.

187
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:06,440
I'll do it myself.

188
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,039
card

189
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,399
Are the same rooms.

190
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:43,720
Your room is the most comfortable.

191
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:46,440
Xuan Yi.

192
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:47,240
That

193
00:14:47,639 --> 00:14:48,360
Wash your hands first.

194
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,080
Let's go down for dinner.

195
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:51,759
Luo Beichen.

196
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:54,559
I'm a little tired today.

197
00:14:54,559 --> 00:14:55,720
Why don't you go and eat yourself?

198
00:14:58,639 --> 00:14:59,320
I'll bring it up for you.

199
00:15:01,759 --> 00:15:02,679
Luo Beichen.

200
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:04,440
I know what you want to eat.

201
00:15:04,559 --> 00:15:05,200
Listen to my arrangement.

202
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:06,120
Watch it.

203
00:15:06,679 --> 00:15:07,480
Watch it.

204
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:08,639
That's right.

205
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:10,639
You're satisfied.

206
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:32,519
The heart of the starry sky.

207
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:33,480
inspiration

208
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:36,799
From Van Gogh's classic painting "Starry Sky."

209
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:40,200
With 36 natural jade beads as green leaves.

210
00:15:40,759 --> 00:15:41,879
This one.

211
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,399
The peerless pigeon blood red diamond.

212
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:46,519
It's a burning flame.

213
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:48,240
And the flowing blood.

214
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:51,799
A symbol of undying love.

215
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:04,559
If you are ruthless,

216
00:16:04,759 --> 00:16:06,080
Then don't blame me.

217
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,440
You're my sister.

218
00:16:08,559 --> 00:16:09,799
I don't believe you can.

219
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,399
How could you

220
00:16:23,559 --> 00:16:24,519
Okay, this one is over.

221
00:16:29,919 --> 00:16:30,639
This traffic

222
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:32,440
Half of them are acting skills.

223
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:34,440
Let's get ready.

224
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:35,039
Get ready for the next one.

225
00:16:35,039 --> 00:16:35,679
Okay, no problem.

226
00:16:37,919 --> 00:16:38,960
director

227
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:39,879
Just now,

228
00:16:39,879 --> 00:16:41,159
It hurts so much.

229
00:16:41,679 --> 00:16:43,360
Has affected their performance.

230
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:45,279
Should I get you a double?

231
00:16:45,639 --> 00:16:46,399
No, no.

232
00:16:46,679 --> 00:16:48,200
He's very dedicated.

233
00:16:48,679 --> 00:16:49,840
Thank you, Miss Lin.

234
00:16:50,799 --> 00:16:51,720
Take a seat, Zheng.

235
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:53,240
I'll get you some water.

236
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:53,639
good

237
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:55,600
come

238
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:56,200
Thank you

239
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,279
I think the one you mentioned just now

240
00:16:57,279 --> 00:16:58,320
You're so great.

241
00:16:58,440 --> 00:16:59,840
You're very affectionate.

242
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:01,200
And the drama is in the eyes.

243
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,960
I was touched just now.

244
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:03,600
Really

245
00:17:03,679 --> 00:17:04,720
But I think

246
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,960
We didn't cooperate well just now.

247
00:17:08,279 --> 00:17:08,759
such

248
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:10,759
You can take the arrow later.

249
00:17:10,759 --> 00:17:11,759
Just a little bit.

250
00:17:12,279 --> 00:17:13,960
You can't get this shot.

251
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,039
And then give the other person a hint.

252
00:17:16,039 --> 00:17:17,000
Alright.

253
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:19,079
It's her.

254
00:17:19,279 --> 00:17:21,039
And give guidance to others?

255
00:17:23,759 --> 00:17:24,519
Okay, get ready.

256
00:17:24,519 --> 00:17:25,559
Let's take a photo.

257
00:17:25,559 --> 00:17:26,240
to be ready

258
00:17:26,599 --> 00:17:27,680
What are you wearing?

259
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:51,640
Where is she?

260
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:53,640
Check out, sir.

261
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:54,799
When did this happen?

262
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:55,640
I just left.

263
00:17:56,039 --> 00:17:56,920
Hold this for me.

264
00:17:59,079 --> 00:18:00,799
Sir, I'll put it in for you.

265
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:27,200
This Yu Hao Qiu is OK.

266
00:18:27,359 --> 00:18:29,000
New Director Award.

267
00:18:30,319 --> 00:18:31,359
His film

268
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:32,519
What's his name again?

269
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:35,359
The past and present life of an alpaca.

270
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:37,480
That's right.

271
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,640
The previous and present lives of alpacas.

272
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:42,400
Where are the film festivals?

273
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:44,599
First, I can get this award.

274
00:18:45,799 --> 00:18:47,400
Very happy.

275
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:49,039
And thank you for the award.

276
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:49,519
Thank you

277
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,640
Cloiaco

278
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:54,799
You really have a way.

279
00:18:56,359 --> 00:18:58,240
Don't care where the film festival is.

280
00:18:58,359 --> 00:18:58,960
Right?

281
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,519
He got the bonus.

282
00:19:00,599 --> 00:19:02,000
The next drama is coming.

283
00:19:02,759 --> 00:19:03,359
No matter what,

284
00:19:03,359 --> 00:19:04,000
It will work.

285
00:19:06,319 --> 00:19:07,880
That kind of movie festival.

286
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,079
Who will win the prize?

287
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:11,400
Director Wang doesn't care to go.

288
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,720
Otherwise, what's wrong with him?

289
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:13,480
Right, Director?

290
00:19:17,759 --> 00:19:18,759
This script

291
00:19:18,839 --> 00:19:20,960
Spent four years to polish it.

292
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,240
And cost a lot of our efforts.

293
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:24,559
I want to be here.

294
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:26,480
Thank you to everyone in my team.

295
00:19:26,839 --> 00:19:27,359
meanwhile

296
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,079
Sorry

297
00:19:29,079 --> 00:19:30,680
Press the volume button.

298
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:34,440
Wen Wen.

299
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:35,480
It's time to go.

300
00:19:35,839 --> 00:19:36,839
Here you are, sister.

301
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,200
Miss Jia Lin.

302
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:43,519
I just watched the Kroyago Film Festival Award.

303
00:19:43,519 --> 00:19:44,640
Do you know a director?

304
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:45,880
It's Yu Hao Qiu.

305
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:47,079
I think he's good.

306
00:19:47,079 --> 00:19:47,880
When the movie comes out,

307
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:48,880
Let's go and have a look.

308
00:19:50,279 --> 00:19:51,279
What are you talking about?

309
00:19:51,279 --> 00:19:52,519
You're not serious.

310
00:19:53,279 --> 00:19:54,559
How come you have no ability?

311
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:54,960
Look.

312
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:56,920
I just saw the film footage.

313
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:57,880
It's really good.

314
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:58,319
Look.

315
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,400
It's hard to win the award.

316
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,079
Right?

317
00:20:01,279 --> 00:20:02,319
Have you got everything?

318
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:03,160
Let's go.

319
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,160
Got it all.

320
00:20:11,519 --> 00:20:13,519
Why is it so dark today?

321
00:20:43,799 --> 00:20:45,559
You fixed these lights?

322
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:46,960
To be exact,

323
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,279
I asked someone to fix it.

324
00:20:48,279 --> 00:20:50,119
My wife is a coward.

325
00:20:58,079 --> 00:20:59,880
Why are you so nice?

326
00:21:00,039 --> 00:21:02,200
Did I save all mankind in my previous life?

327
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,279
Don't talk nonsense.

328
00:21:03,759 --> 00:21:04,880
Is the whole universe.

329
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:14,000
Will there be any program today?

330
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,599
I don't want to be scared anymore.

331
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:17,839
wife

332
00:21:17,839 --> 00:21:19,400
Why are you so scared?

333
00:21:24,839 --> 00:21:26,519
I'm busy.

334
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,160
Don't bother.

335
00:21:29,559 --> 00:21:31,480
What's Mr. Long doing recently?

336
00:21:33,279 --> 00:21:33,839
wife

337
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,920
I've been eyeing

338
00:21:37,119 --> 00:21:40,160
It has a bright future. It's a sure thing.

339
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:41,279
It's a great project.

340
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:42,759
Really?

341
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:52,079
Are you talking about fixing the street lamp?
