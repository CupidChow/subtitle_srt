Your dad didn't ask you to manage the art district.

and the second one is half price.

115
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:00,870

are going up in price on Valentine's Day.

117

You took my steak to pick up girls?

118
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,130
Is it inappropriate not to raise the price?

Businessman.

I've bought all the food.

134
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:20,200
Then I'll transfer the money to you via WeChat,

135
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:23,000
but I'll treat you instead of accompanying you,

136

It's so boring.

137
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:25,310
I'll go in first.

138

We have to deal with this.

Okay, I'll call them tomorrow

144

and tell them about it.

145

Luo, right?

146
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,570
Xuan Yi told me about you,

didn't she?

148
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:47,600
What did you say about me?

149
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,470
She said you crashed her car.

150
00:07:54,970 --> 00:07:55,920
We're just kidding.

151
00:07:56,890 --> 00:07:58,660
It's too much for fun.

152
00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:00,040
It's too dangerous.

153
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:02,480
It's not as dangerous as you.

154
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:06,800
Judging from your age,

155
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,380
your child is about my age, right?

156
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:11,290
It's about the same.

157
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:14,210
Xin is one year older than you, right?

158
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:15,880
Xin is two years older than me. Yes,

two years older.

160

Look, I forgot.

You're so honest,

Don't you think you're wasting your time?

164
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,760
I don't think it's a waste of time.

165
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,950
On the contrary, I think

166
00:08:33,290 --> 00:08:35,030
you're wasting my time.

167

00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:44,110
let me get this straight.

170
00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:46,140
How can you leave Xuanyi?

171
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:49,600
You made a deal with me,

172
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,050
even though I couldn't satisfy you right away,

173
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:52,160
But I will do my best.

174
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,000
Not bad.

175
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:58,530
I don't think you need to hang yourself from a tree.

176
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:00,420
Think about other trees.

177
00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:02,420
Uncle,

178
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:03,930
what are you talking about?

179
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:09,140
Uncle Da.

180
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:12,660
That's right.

181
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:13,930
What do you think?

182
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,390
Why doesn't it matter?

183
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:19,100
What matters is what Uncle thinks.

184
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:20,290
Uncle,

185
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:21,840
come on. I just bought it. Look at

186
00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:23,250
the oysters.

187
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:24,550
Fresh oysters.

188
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,430
Look. They're fresh. Really.

189
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:28,260
It's really fresh.

190
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:29,420
Try one.

191
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:30,640
Let me get one for you.

192
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:33,170
Xuanyi's father died early,

193
00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:34,910
and I brought her up.

194
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:36,610
Yes, yes, yes.

195
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:38,330
Just like my own daughter.

196
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:40,020
Yes, yes, yes.

197
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:41,570
If anyone dares to bully her,

198
00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:42,940
who dares?

199
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:44,970
Young man,

200
00:09:45,410 --> 00:09:46,520
what do you do?

201
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:47,760
Me,

202
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,610
Mine.

203
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:07,600
Come on in.

204
00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:10,380
Slow down. Slow down.

205
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:11,390
No, honey,

206
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:12,420
let's go back to our own home.

207
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:13,990
You don't have to be so sneaky, do you?

208
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:18,280
Let's keep it down.

209
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:19,330
I was heard by Mr. Momo.

210
00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:20,450
I'm going to be deducted again.

211
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:22,610
My score is running out.

212
00:10:22,610 --> 00:10:23,670
Then deduct it.

213
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:28,330
Five points will be deducted

214
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:29,370
if you come back late at night,

215
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:31,650
Miss Momo,

216
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:34,250
Jingmei went out with me today.

217
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:35,200
It's not her fault. If you deduct it,

218
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:37,600
you'll deduct mine.

219
00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:39,080
Really?

220
00:10:40,810 --> 00:10:44,460
Right?

221
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:46,460
20 points for lying,

222
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:49,440
right? Miss Jing Mei. Okay. See you in the living room at 8: 00 tomorrow

223
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,180
morning

224
00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:09,590
Okay,

225
00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:11,730
Have a good rest.

226
00:11:12,210 --> 00:11:12,930
I'll get going.

227
00:11:12,930 --> 00:11:14,330
I'm sorry, uncle.

228
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:15,840
Let's make an appointment another day.

229
00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:17,890
I'll treat you to a nice meal some other day. Thank you

230
00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:19,740
for your invitation. No need.

231
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:21,060
I said please,

232
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:21,830
but I didn't say please,

233
00:11:21,830 --> 00:11:22,620
did I, uncle?

234
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:24,470
Why is your uncle also surnamed Chen with us?

235
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:26,470
All right, all right.

236
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:27,390
Uncle is gone.

237
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:28,480
Take your time.

238
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:30,800
Take care, uncle.

239
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:31,610
Take care, uncle.

240
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:35,820
Chen Xuanyi,

241
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:37,820
this is your fault.

242
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:38,730
Good night.

243
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:41,670
Let's get this straight.

244
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,140
Trouble some people,

245
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:46,360
when they can't figure out the relationship between others,

246
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:47,780
Don't cause trouble to others.

247
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:49,870
Xuan Yi,

248
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,070
Xuan Yi

249
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:54,820
Good evening, sir.

250
00:12:06,210 --> 00:12:06,680
Mr. Chen,

251
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:07,740
Mingzhe,

252
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,000
Let's get ready to carry out Plan B.

253
00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:12,260
Uncle and I didn't make a deal.

254
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:14,930
Okay.

255
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:34,670
Honey,

256
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:35,810
I've made up my mind.

257
00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:36,730
I think we should

258
00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:38,290
go to the village for the elderly.

259
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:40,560
The village head and the others can't stay away, can they?

260
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,390
It has been hidden for years.

261
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:43,610
We can't wait.

262
00:12:44,590 --> 00:12:45,810
But uncle

263
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:47,400
… What is he? No matter what uncle says, he is also mother's

264
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:57,250
brother.

265
00:12:57,900 --> 00:13:00,060
You can't just die of old age and never see each other again.

266
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:02,020
He didn't take me as his nephew at all,

267
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:04,740
did you ever take him as your uncle?

268
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:12,010
If I were alive,

269
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,010
seeing you like this,

270
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:15,520
I'm sure it'll be hard.

271
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,630
My mom really loves him.

272
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:19,720
Every year on my birthday,

273
00:13:20,170 --> 00:13:21,510
I used to take him with my grandfather

274
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:23,380
to last year's hot spring resort,

275
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:24,880
The resort.

276
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:29,160
Ask your brother to send you back.

277
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:31,440
He went to the resort.

278
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:34,300
Grandpa mentioned it before,

279
00:13:35,130 --> 00:13:36,770
saying that uncle just went to the resort,

280
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:38,950
That's Nian's property in Hot Spring Town.

281
00:13:39,530 --> 00:13:41,490
He works as an inspector once a year,

282
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:44,870
so how many people

283
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:46,420
can this resort accept at one time?

284
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:50,720
It should be quite a lot.

285
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:52,720
It's a village,

286
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:54,500
but it's actually a small town.

287
00:13:58,050 --> 00:14:00,650
Do you think the village head and the others will...?

288
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,760
It's possible.

289
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:06,230
Let's go

290
00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:14,370
This is the first time.

291
00:14:14,610 --> 00:14:15,860
This is the first time.

292
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,110
This one.

293
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:23,300
Hello,

294
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:25,700
welcome to Huatian Resort.

295
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:26,210
-What are you

296
00:14:26,210 --> 00:14:27,500
doing? -Village Head,

297
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,120
Don't worry.

298
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:31,540
Girls,

299
00:14:32,650 --> 00:14:34,020
you must be in the wrong room.

300
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:35,510
Hello, Mr. Liu,

301
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:36,610
this is the massage service

302
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:38,770
that Mr. Nian specially arranged for you.

303
00:14:38,770 --> 00:14:39,750
Please lie down.

304
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:40,490
Mr. Liu,

305
00:14:40,490 --> 00:14:41,320
please lie down.

306
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,550
Wrong, wrong.

307
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:44,690
I'm just a village head,

308
00:14:44,690 --> 00:14:45,570
Liu,

309
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:47,080
Lie down first.

310
00:14:50,730 --> 00:14:51,470
Honey,

311
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:52,560
in such a big resort,

312
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:53,470
How should we find him?

313
00:14:54,530 --> 00:14:55,470
Look at your husband,

314
00:14:55,470 --> 00:15:00,100
(Mission Hills Resort-Haikou),

315
00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:00,660
Welcome.

316
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:01,610
Hello. Welcome.

317
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:02,580
Go

318
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:03,500
Call your manager.

319
00:15:04,050 --> 00:15:04,800
Sir,

320
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,270
if you're a friend of our manager,

321
00:15:06,270 --> 00:15:06,960
Please give him

322
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:08,010
a call in person.

323
00:15:08,010 --> 00:15:08,980
I'm new here.

324
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:09,930
Without his contact information,

325
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:12,510
can't you change someone else?

326
00:15:12,950 --> 00:15:14,200
It's working time now.

327
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,600
You can't leave your job.

328
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:16,580
No one is here now.

329
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,090
Aren't you human?

330
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:23,250
Excuse me,

331
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:24,730
where is your manager's office?

332
00:15:24,730 --> 00:15:25,980
We can find it ourselves.

333
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:28,400
The management's offices are all on the east side building,

334
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,020
just go straight ahead.

335
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,920
I don't know which room it is.

336
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,140
Okay. Thank you.

337
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:38,770
You have a bright future.

338
00:15:44,930 --> 00:15:46,510
Hello, Mr. Long,

339
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,230
I'm the manager here,

340
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,880
My last name is Yang Yang Shuguang.

341
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:51,880
This is my business card.

342
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:55,540
I'm really sorry.

343
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:57,070
I didn't know you're here today,

344
00:15:57,570 --> 00:15:58,500
but I'm sorry to welcome you.

345
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:00,250
It's okay.

346
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,180
I just came to have a look.

347
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:03,770
This is my wife, Mrs. Long

348
00:16:04,410 --> 00:16:05,490
Hello,

349
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:06,100
Hello,

350
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:07,650
are there only two of you today?

351
00:16:07,770 --> 00:16:08,230
Yes.

352
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:09,950
You think there are too few people here.

353
00:16:10,850 --> 00:16:11,400
No, no,

354
00:16:11,710 --> 00:16:13,040
no. Just come to me.

355
00:16:13,770 --> 00:16:15,700
I'm sure I've arranged it well for both of you.

356
00:16:16,170 --> 00:16:17,520
Not just the two of you,

357
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:18,550
for 200 people,

358
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:20,740
We also have this reception ability.

359
00:16:20,930 --> 00:16:21,530
Really?

360
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:24,830
Last time when my uncle took the old group,

361
00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:25,700
how did you arrange it?

362
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:27,920
Mr. Long didn't know

363
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,130
you were

364
00:16:30,130 --> 00:16:30,930
like this.

365
00:16:30,930 --> 00:16:33,690
In addition to receiving individual customers,

366
00:16:34,330 --> 00:16:37,540
it's all meetings of various companies.

367
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:39,570
Tour groups rarely receive you.

368
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:40,790
Why are you playing dumb with me?

369
00:16:41,010 --> 00:16:41,510
No, no,

370
00:16:42,110 --> 00:16:43,750
how dare I play dumb with you?

371
00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:44,880
Besides,

372
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,330
the whole resort,

373
00:16:46,330 --> 00:16:47,700
Aren't you also the host?

374
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:52,870
Manager Yang,

375
00:16:53,130 --> 00:16:54,640
how many years have you worked here?

376
00:16:55,470 --> 00:16:56,430
It's been seven or eight years.

377
00:16:57,510 --> 00:16:58,780
How is the company's treatment?

378
00:16:58,970 --> 00:16:59,800
Okay.

379
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:02,410
The Nian clan has been treating us well.

380
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:04,530
Did Mr. Nian get up today?

381
00:17:04,530 --> 00:17:05,440
You're up.

382
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,540
President Nian

383
00:17:07,290 --> 00:17:08,750
is usually busy,

384
00:17:09,290 --> 00:17:11,960
I'm not sure.

385
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:15,580
Then I won't bother you, uncle.

386
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:17,650
Please arrange it for us.

387
00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:19,050
Here's the thing.

388
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:19,580
Okay,

389
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:21,340
Then we have a new project,

390
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:22,480
called Yumu Medicine Bath,

391
00:17:23,090 --> 00:17:25,640
Men feel better when soaked,

392
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:26,850
women feel better when soaked in skin,

393
00:17:26,850 --> 00:17:28,460
Let me arrange it for you.

394
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:29,500
It's so hard.

395
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:30,800
I'll arrange it.

396
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:32,900
Hold on.

397
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:34,160
Yes.

398
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:34,880
Thank you.

399
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,380
Uncle must be here.

400
00:18:09,790 --> 00:18:11,020
The old people should be here too.

401
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:11,670
Yes.

402
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:13,120
Manager Yang, at first glance,

403
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,770
is a spy who has been around for years.

404
00:18:15,450 --> 00:18:16,960
Now I'm afraid Nian Shiyu

405
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,720
will know that we're looking for someone.

406
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:19,970
You want to hide the old man again,

407
00:18:22,090 --> 00:18:24,240
it's not easy to hide so many people,

408
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,430
But in such a big place,

409
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:26,650
it's even harder to find them.

410
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:29,860
I wish I could alert the enemy.

411
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:31,480
Then they can move their positions.

412
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:40,290
Nian Shi is not stupid,

413
00:18:40,530 --> 00:18:41,020
Let's go.

414
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:47,830
Mr. Nian,

415
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:50,650
should we take the old man away first?

416
00:18:53,050 --> 00:18:53,460
No need.

417
00:18:55,910 --> 00:18:57,650
They're worried that they can't find anyone.

418
00:18:58,880 --> 00:18:59,460
If you move,

419
00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:02,000
won't you tell them

420
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:02,820
where the old man is?

421
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,770
Then let them look for it like this.

422
00:19:05,330 --> 00:19:06,540
We'll find him sooner or later.

423
00:19:12,690 --> 00:19:13,600
Will you be able to find it?

424
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:18,660
Yi.

425
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:23,230
Will you find it?

426
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:31,530
They should live here.

427
00:19:31,730 --> 00:19:34,000
But we can't look for them in private rooms.

428
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:38,490
Hello,

429
00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:39,440
Excuse me,

430
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:40,280
Did a group of aunts and grandfathers

431
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:41,900
come here these two days,

432
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:43,090
Which district are they in?

433
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:44,530
You

434
00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:49,510
… We have a senior group here to rest.

435
00:19:49,510 --> 00:19:50,610
I'm their guide.

436
00:19:50,850 --> 00:19:51,600
Tour guide,

437
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,580
we don't have any senior group today.

438
00:19:53,850 --> 00:19:55,000
Is it in another district?

439
00:19:56,230 --> 00:19:56,900
I'm sorry,

440
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:58,040
Why don't you ask the manager?

441
00:19:58,450 --> 00:19:58,970
Okay,

442
00:19:58,970 --> 00:19:59,980
Thank you.

443
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:03,870
But this is the last area.

444
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:05,890
No,

445
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:08,020
there's another area,

446
00:20:08,850 --> 00:20:09,290
Let's go.

447
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:19,950
Be gentle. Be gentle.

448
00:20:19,950 --> 00:20:21,520
Do you have a bad heart?

449
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,180
He has had heart disease

450
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:25,580
for many years.

451
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:27,040
How did you know that?

452
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:29,350
The inside of the foot is the reflex zone

453
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:30,100
of the heart. It hurts here,

454
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:31,080
It means he has a bad heart.

455
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:32,780
If there's nothing else, just press it more.

456
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:34,110
Miss,

457
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:36,290
go put on some clothes.

458
00:20:36,290 --> 00:20:37,440
Don't catch a cold.

459
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:39,080
These are our overalls.

460
00:20:40,690 --> 00:20:41,360
Oh no.

461
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:42,560
And legs?

462
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:43,870
Legs,

463
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:45,600
I don't need my legs.

464
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,250
This is what Mr. Nian specially ordered.

465
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:48,500
Let's treat you well.

466
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:49,540
No need.

467
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:25,870
How did you know the password?

468
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,270
Mom's birthday

469
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:30,530
doesn't seem to have changed.

470
00:21:42,350 --> 00:21:42,730
Mr. Liu,

471
00:21:42,730 --> 00:21:44,160
how strong is this?

472
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,360
Okay.

473
00:21:48,550 --> 00:21:49,380
Village Head.

474
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:53,210
Young Master Long,

475
00:21:54,410 --> 00:21:55,650
Mrs. Long,

476
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:58,010
Why are you here?

477
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:12,610
Good morning.

478
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:13,520
-What a coincidence. -Morning.

479
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:18,920
Can I help you?

480
00:22:19,150 --> 00:22:19,680
It's okay.

481
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:21,400
What's up?

482
00:22:27,650 --> 00:22:28,460
Luo Beichen,

483
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:31,140
when did you become such a coward?

484
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:39,780
The money must have been donated.

485
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:41,330
The bank said it,

486
00:22:43,150 --> 00:22:43,720
We're not

487
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:45,970
spending money on public funds,

488
00:22:46,590 --> 00:22:48,480
Someone invited us here.

489
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:50,480
The bank said

490
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:53,590
Long Chen's donation will arrive in a few days.

491
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:56,050
We're not spending on public funds,

492
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:57,510
Longchen Fund,

493
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:00,970
He not only donated money and materials to us,

494
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:03,900
but also helped us to connect with

495
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:05,320
several voluntary organizations.

496
00:23:05,650 --> 00:23:08,080
It has helped our village a lot.

497
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:10,940
(Zhao Mingzhe)

498
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:11,850
President Chen,

499
00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:13,170
Mr. Long sent it to me.

500
00:23:13,170 --> 00:23:14,290
The trend of public opinion is much better.

501
00:23:14,290 --> 00:23:15,310
The problem should be solved.

502
00:23:17,330 --> 00:23:19,090
It's too early to say the problem is solved.

503
00:23:19,390 --> 00:23:20,130
Pay attention to

504
00:23:20,130 --> 00:23:21,280
the enterprises in Guangdong first.

505
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:31,020
Zhang,

506
00:23:32,150 --> 00:23:33,020
what's the date today?

507
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:34,690
The 19th.

508
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:36,360
Mr. Nian,

509
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:38,100
