1
00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:59,460


2
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:26,640
Nice to meet you, Prosecutor Baek Joon Soo.

3
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:38,050
A long time ago, there was a legendary con artist.

4
00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:44,060
His name was Sa Ma Cheon.

5
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:49,180
Have you heard of him by any chance, Prosecutor Baek Joon Soo?

6
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:53,660
I've heard a lot about him.

7
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:58,860
I heard he died twenty years ago.

8
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:04,110
The peak for a con artist is to even stage his own death.

9
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,720
To even his own son?

10
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:13,980
There must have been a reason to deceive even the son.

11
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:20,320
I'm curious what that reason could be?

12
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:22,530
You wonder about it?

13
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:27,970
If you help me with this project, I'll tell you the reason.

14
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:31,610
This project?

15
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:35,890
What's wrong? You came here knowingly.

16
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:39,600
Players recognize each other.

17
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:05,260
Gates of Hell project. Behind this project,

18
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:07,800
I expected that there would be an amazing planner.

19
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:11,810
And that was you, Elder.

20
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:17,780
I knew there was a great prosecutor who was after Geum Tae Woong.

21
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:21,350
But I didn't know it would be you, Prosecutor Baek.

22
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:27,410
I need one more player for this project.

23
00:03:27,410 --> 00:03:31,580
Someone like you, Prosecutor Baek Joon Soo.

24
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:35,040
Let's con... together?

25
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:39,370
Yes. Us two.

26
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:45,320
A con with you, the prosecutor.

27
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:53,630
Let's pull a big con!

28
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:14,110
 Switch 

29
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:17,550
 You don't set a trap in the dark 

30
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:23,690
 A con with you, the prosecutor. 

31
00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:27,970
 Let's pull a big con! 

32
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:36,960
Father didn't change one bit.

33
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:42,130
 He reappears in twenty years and says to pull a big con? 

34
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:54,600
How did your visit to Victor go?

35
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,290
Ah, that.

36
00:04:56,290 --> 00:04:59,210
I know this because my job requires me to meet all kinds of people.

37
00:04:59,210 --> 00:05:03,000
That man, Victor is just a businessman. A very hardworking one.

38
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,080
I thought you said he's a con artist. Didn't you go there to test him out?

39
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:10,590
What's going on? Did you plot something together before you came back?

40
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:13,110
Saying con artists should work together?

41
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:17,370
What are you taking me for? I am Prosecutor Baek Joon Soo.

42
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:19,630
But you're Sa Do Chan on the inside.

43
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:22,480
Prosecutor Oh.

44
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:26,610
- This is an opportunity.
 - Opportunity?

45
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:30,080
Let's catch Geum Tae Woong with this.

46
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:34,470
Think about it. The natural gas business requires an astronomical amount of money.

47
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:38,210
Even if Geum Tae Woong made lots of money with drugs,

48
00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:42,510
it won't be easy for him to come up with billions of won for investment.

49
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:43,640
Probably.

50
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:46,940
Geum Tae Woong will begin to gather all his assets that are scattered around.

51
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:51,630
Then, his assets that he hid under borrowed names illegally will come out to the world.

52
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:57,050
And we just watch that process and we pick up everything the moment everything is gathered in one place.

53
00:05:57,050 --> 00:05:59,040
Bingo. As expected.

54
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:01,090
I'm quite sharp.

55
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:06,830
But do you think Geum Tae Woong will really take this bait?

56
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:10,410
We'll have to hold the bait and swing it in front of him.

57
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:17,650
 Geum Tae Woong 

58
00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:19,400
It's Geum Tae Woong.

59
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:26,430
This is Baek Joon Soo.

60
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:28,470
King of Faberge...

61
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:32,330
It was an exhibit that I had prepared for several years.

62
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:36,210
Sa Do Chan ruined that. And in the end, his joke after that was...

63
00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:39,830
It was Chief Prosecutor Jeong Do Yeong's Terracotta Warriors.

64
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:43,000
What he wanted to take out of my gallery...

65
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,910
What he wanted to take wasn't King of Faberge.

66
00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:53,010
It was Chief Prosecutor Jeong Do Yeong that I wanted to turn into a king.

67
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:58,540
What is your reason for saying this to me?

68
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:01,460
Is the person in front of me

69
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:07,550
really Prosecutor Baek Joon Soo?

70
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,170
I'm offended.

71
00:07:11,170 --> 00:07:15,020
Are you asking me to prove to you again that I'm Baek Joon Soo?

72
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:17,680
It's a logical suspicion.

73
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:20,490
Two people can imitate one person.

74
00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:26,720
But one person can't be in two places at the same time.

75
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:31,050
Should I show you the burn again?

76
00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:39,820
This is the CEO's office.

77
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:42,450
Sa Do Chan?

78
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:53,320
CEO Geum, have you been well?

79
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:56,270
 Do you still play Jianggi these days? 

80
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:05,620
 Looks like you found the wiretap. What do you eat all the time? 

81
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:07,690
 I thought my ear drums were going to pop. 

82
00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:10,440
Sa Do Chan...

83
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:13,900
Customer, are you angry?

84
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:18,490
I'm not running anywhere. Catch me if you can.

85
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:43,630
 Soongui University 

86
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:51,010
Professor, I heard that voices have fingerprints. Is that right?

87
00:08:51,010 --> 00:08:53,710
That's right. Even for identical twins,

88
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:56,990
we can distinguish between them if we do a voice analysis.

89
00:08:56,990 --> 00:08:59,490
Please analyze this voice.

90
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:09,310
CEO Geum, have you been well?

91
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:12,160
 Do you still play Jianggi these days? 

92
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:18,040
 Looks like you found the wiretap. What do you eat all the time? 

93
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:20,630
 I thought my ear drums were going to pop. 

94
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:23,010
 I'm offended. 

95
00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:26,580
 Are you asking me to prove to you again that I'm Baek Joon Soo? 

96
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:30,460
 Must I show you my burn scar again? 

97
00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:36,020
The left one has 116 Hz – 129 Hz.

98
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:40,000
The right one has 124 Hz – 137 Hz.

99
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:45,010
These two are definitely different people.

100
00:09:45,010 --> 00:09:46,620
Then...

101
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:52,400
It survived with me when I fell into the ocean.

102
00:09:54,790 --> 00:10:01,350
The owner of this voice will be one of the two.

103
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:10,850
 It survived with me when I fell into the oceanin Sokcho. 

104
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:13,180
This voice...

105
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:16,680
It matches this one.

106
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:22,890
 You found the wiretap. 

107
00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:26,430
- Are you certain?
 - Yes, I am.

108
00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:43,780
 Soongui University 

109
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:47,750
Now, a prosecutor pretends to be a con artist?

110
00:10:49,370 --> 00:10:55,470
Sa Do Chan and Baek Joon Soo, how long did you think you would be able to fool me?

111
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:05,100
A conman and a prosecutor on the same side?

112
00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:10,450
I'll get you both.

113
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:15,980
You're done with your games.

114
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:23,960
Prosecutor Baek Joon Soo has arrived.

115
00:11:26,710 --> 00:11:31,210
I'm sorry to call you so late. It's such an urgent matter.

116
00:11:31,210 --> 00:11:34,960
That's alright, but what's the matter?

117
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:42,270
The Gates of Hell in Turkistan. I'm going to invest in that.

118
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:44,810
Weren't you rejected (by Victor Jang)?

119
00:11:44,810 --> 00:11:47,240
It's outside of my scope of abilities.

120
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:51,070
The law. You can come up with any reason to say that he's violated something.

121
00:11:51,070 --> 00:11:55,590
Do whatever it takes for you to come up with a reason and bring that Victor to me.

122
00:11:58,590 --> 00:12:02,420
Let's make this a success. You and me.

123
00:12:05,610 --> 00:12:11,050
When this project succeeds, I'll open a bottle of champaign.

124
00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:29,240
I just met Geum Tae Woong urgently.

125
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:34,470
I think he's sensing something. He wants to meet Victor Jang.

126
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:39,270
What should we do? Shall I go meet him?

127
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:40,610
I think you should go.

128
00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:42,750
That would be better, right?

129
00:12:53,050 --> 00:12:57,860
CEO, Prosecutor Baek Joon Soo is here with Victor.

130
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:00,020
Have them come in.

131
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:06,750
Welcome, President Victor. We meet again.

132
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:08,850
How could Korea work like this?

133
00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:11,370
Sending over a prosecutor and blackmailing me?

134
00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:16,780
There's no way. I'm sure you had something you didn't do right.

135
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:18,620
Then I'll let you two talk in private.

136
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:21,020
- I'll be—
 - No, Prosecutor Baek.

137
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:22,280
Let's go together.

138
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:26,210
I thought I was to only bring him here.

139
00:13:26,210 --> 00:13:29,620
Let's go together. What we begin together, we must end together.

140
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:31,680
Please, take a seat.

141
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:45,140
The natural gas business. I'll invest in it. 100 billion won.

142
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:47,490
I'll raise it to 200 billion won.

143
00:13:47,490 --> 00:13:48,390
200 billion won?

144
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:53,180
So that I'd have a proper reason to tell Governor Choi Jeong Pil.

145
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:58,830
200 billion won. Fine.

146
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,050
As a bearer bond.

147
00:14:01,050 --> 00:14:03,900
 Bearer Bond: Bond payable to anyone who has possession, "bears",  it. 

148
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:06,460
Are you making up a reason for me to turn you down?

149
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:12,690
If you don't like it, I'll understand that this deal didn't happen and I'll go back to Russia.

150
00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:17,010
Let's do that. I'll agree with both.

151
00:14:17,010 --> 00:14:20,590
Two hundred billion won. As a bearer bond.

152
00:14:21,530 --> 00:14:23,190
I'll give you two weeks.

153
00:14:23,190 --> 00:14:25,030
Fine.

154
00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:40,480
CEO, don't you think you're overdoing this?

155
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,440
How will you come up with 200 billion won in cash?

156
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:47,060
Director Kim, what happened with Sa Do Chan?

157
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:50,150
He's running away so cleverly.

158
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:53,920
Didn't you see him leave just now?

159
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:56,990
What do you...?

160
00:14:56,990 --> 00:14:58,120
Just now Prosecutor Baek Joon Soo...

161
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:05,240
It's Sa Do Chan. Sa Do Chan who is pretending to be Prosecutor Baek.

162
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:07,630
The two of them have plotted together.

163
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:28,170
Sunbae, I have something to discuss with you...

164
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:33,950
Sunbae.

165
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:37,610
Sunbae! Sunbae! Wake up! Sunbae!

166
00:15:37,610 --> 00:15:39,390
Sunbae!

167
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:12,610
Governor, we have trouble.

168
00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:14,530
What? What happened?

169
00:16:14,530 --> 00:16:18,740
Victor says he'll make a deal with Geum Tae Woong.

170
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:21,490
Geum Tae Woong, that man?

171
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:28,500
That bastard! That bastard!

172
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:46,680
 May 5 

173
00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:56,890
Did your father return?

174
00:16:58,020 --> 00:17:00,420
Do Chan. Eat this.

175
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:02,620
It's fine. I'm not hungry.

176
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:04,570
I'm not giving it to you for free.

177
00:17:04,570 --> 00:17:09,260
He was so kind to me last time. So, I'm giving it to you to show more of my gratitude.

178
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:10,660
Hurry and eat a bit.

179
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:14,570
Then, I'll give it to Dad when he comes back.

180
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:29,760
 Let's go. 

181
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,430
 Daddy! 

182
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:33,260
 Take this. 

183
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:35,100
 My precious one. 

184
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:46,180
Is anyone home?

185
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:47,970
Who are you?

186
00:17:47,970 --> 00:17:51,850
We are from the police. Is no one else home?

187
00:17:57,990 --> 00:18:00,320
What is this?

188
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:14,040
 Death Certificate 

189
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:20,570
 Suicide 

190
00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:55,840
I connected him to Victor. Geum Tae Woong did bite the bait, but...

191
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:59,160
That guy... He's a very suspicious catfish.

192
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:02,980
He might just cut the fishing line and run away one of these days.

193
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:07,480
Until I put him in my bucket, he's not my fish.

194
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:11,600
So you haven't forgotten.

195
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:16,650
I learned to con before I learned the multiplication tables.

196
00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:19,430
You should know that very well.

197
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:21,910
You can never let your guard down,

198
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:27,290
not until you can cut off the catfish's neck on the cutting board.

199
00:19:27,290 --> 00:19:34,120
Of course. I have lived my life without a father because of that bastard.

200
00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:45,190
Excuse me, but what happened to your hand?

201
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:48,960
It's a lesson.

202
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:55,310
The ending for a con artist can never be a beautiful one.

203
00:19:57,170 --> 00:20:03,380
It's a lesson I want to teach my son if I ever get to meet him.

204
00:20:13,890 --> 00:20:19,030
Let me know as soon as the next step to our plan is ready.

205
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:41,930
He did bite it, but...

206
00:20:41,930 --> 00:20:43,090
And?

207
00:20:43,090 --> 00:20:45,400
It's so strange because he bit it so easily.

208
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:47,500
What do you mean?

209
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:51,150
When things go too smoothly, you have to be suspicious.

210
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:54,330
If things go over smoothly, you go to the next problem to solve.

211
00:20:54,330 --> 00:20:57,930
These are tax return files I obtained from IRS for property tax and income tax.

212
00:20:57,930 --> 00:21:01,820
If you calculate it, Geum Tae Woong's legal assets are around 2 billion won.

213
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:04,590
Wait, how could someone with 2 billion won...

214
00:21:04,590 --> 00:21:06,220
invest in a 200 billion won business?

215
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:08,810
One, ten, a hundred. It's 100 times what he has.

216
00:21:08,810 --> 00:21:14,830
So, all the assets with borrowed name owners that he's been hiding so well will be released and gathered in one place.

217
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:25,810
 First, I'm sure K-Savings Bank is the easiest place for Geum Tae Woong to pull all his resources. 

218
00:21:25,810 --> 00:21:28,530
Investigator Im, with the cooperation from the Financial Supervisory Service,

219
00:21:28,530 --> 00:21:31,990
please find out if K-banking is giving an illegal loan

220
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:33,050
to any suspicious company.

221
00:21:33,050 --> 00:21:36,480
Excuse me, I'm from the Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office.

222
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:39,260
How can I help you?

223
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:43,030
May I see the documents for loans issued by K-Savings Bank?

224
00:21:44,330 --> 00:21:46,690
Loan documents from 2017 also please.

225
00:21:46,690 --> 00:21:48,330
Yes.

226
00:21:48,330 --> 00:21:50,070
Please take care of it as soon as possible.

227
00:21:50,070 --> 00:21:53,230
Please deposit the amount after the sale here.

228
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:57,450
It will take about a week. Don't worry.

229
00:21:57,450 --> 00:21:59,720
 Sky Commercial Real Estate Office  

230
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:02,140
He's coming out.

231
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:08,640
 1884-1 Jongsan-dong, Jong-gu, Incheon City   

232
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:12,650
 Geum Tae Woong will hurriedly sell his borrowed name assets and real estate. 

233
00:22:12,650 --> 00:22:15,050
 Inspector Go, please figure that out. 

234
00:22:15,050 --> 00:22:18,530
Not much has gone into this area, but it will be extremely desirable in the future.

235
00:22:18,530 --> 00:22:19,440
It's nice.

236
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,910
I'll go with this deal.

237
00:22:20,910 --> 00:22:23,330
You made a good choice.

238
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:26,570
I think Director Kim made the deal.

239
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:32,860
 (1884-1 Jongsan-dong, Jong-gu, Incheon City ) 
 Geum Tae Woong, selling his real estate. 

240
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:42,020
 He will sell his stocks by 10s or 100s of  billion won. 

241
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:46,880
 Ask for the cooperation of the IRS and look into the flow of the stock market. 

242
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:50,410
That building whose owner is Geum Tae Woong's proxy...

243
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:54,500
I confirmed that it's up for sale.

244
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:56,630
Something is off with his stocks.

245
00:22:56,630 --> 00:22:58,730
It seems that some big hand is releasing his stocks into the market.

246
00:22:58,730 --> 00:22:59,870
Okay.

247
00:22:59,870 --> 00:23:04,770
We just have to check to see if there are sales and purchases worth 200 billion won in the market.

248
00:23:04,770 --> 00:23:06,860
Okay.

249
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:11,760
 Prosecutors Office 

250
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:14,790
What are they talking about? I can't hear a thing.

251
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:22,950
They locked the door.

252
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:27,920
The Shark Thugs... these guys are a problem!

253
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:30,750
I told you a long time ago that we should bring them in!

254
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:32,500
Inspector Go! What's going on here?

255
00:23:34,450 --> 00:23:37,690
I'm sorry. I'll do a better job.

256
00:23:37,690 --> 00:23:39,980
So, what, what happened, Prosecutor Gil?

257
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:42,550
It's nothing. Get back to work.

258
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,550
Ah, feels so good.

259
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,570
Geum Tae Woong is really selling all his assets?

260
00:24:03,570 --> 00:24:05,300
I guess he's really going to sign the contract, huh?

261
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:09,090
Then, he has hidden assets that amount to 200 billion won?

262
00:24:09,090 --> 00:24:11,850
Daebak. I heard he doesn't even have kids.

263
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:14,040
What happens to all that money later?

264
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:15,620
What else?

265
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:20,500
If we succeed, he'll be broke.

266
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:24,810
Oh, yeah. That Bang, Bang. Didn't that Bang Bang War boy contact you yet?

267
00:24:24,810 --> 00:24:27,800
He'll call when he's out of money.

268
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:37,900
 If he came in for the purpose of fraud, 

269
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:40,470
 ee would've come in before using his Turkistan passport. 

270
00:24:40,470 --> 00:24:41,930
 A step to gather his information beforehand 

271
00:24:41,930 --> 00:24:46,510
 so that he can deceive his targets. 

272
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:51,340
 I know this because my job requires me to meet all kinds of people. 

273
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:55,900
 That man, Victor is just a businessman. A very hardworking one. 

274
00:24:56,590 --> 00:24:58,930
His attitude changed.

275
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:02,860
Sa Do Chan was so sure Victor Jang was a con artist.

276
00:25:03,930 --> 00:25:06,990
A hardworking businessman?

277
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:11,340
What? You want me to tail Prosecutor  Baek Joon Soo?

278
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:15,610
Yes. Who he meets with and if you see anything suspicious.

279
00:25:15,610 --> 00:25:17,620
And please take some pictures as well.

280
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:20,260
- Don't be like that.
 - Excuse me?

281
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:22,980
You are suspecting him right now.

282
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:25,100
Yes.

283
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:30,850
Prosecutor  Baek Joon Soo doesn't have another woman.

284
00:25:30,850 --> 00:25:34,400
He is always looking so fondly at you in secret.

285
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,840
We are not in that kind of relationship.

286
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:39,200
I understand. We all want confirmation.

287
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:44,700
If there's another woman, forget getting evidence. I'll break her legs.

288
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:47,110
I guess I'll be using my strength soon.

289
00:25:50,730 --> 00:25:52,730
Goodbye.

290
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:58,070
Prosecutor Oh, what are you doing?

291
00:25:58,070 --> 00:25:59,880
You're here.

292
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:03,940
Leave it. What do you know?

293
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:07,120
It's hard on you, so I want to help.

294
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:13,550
My daughter is pretty when she makes dough.

295
00:26:13,550 --> 00:26:15,620
You only realize that now?

296
00:26:18,530 --> 00:26:22,080
Without your dad, I didn't even get to do much for you.

297
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:26,350
You studied your heart out all on your own and became a prosecutor.

298
00:26:28,290 --> 00:26:29,700
Thank you.

299
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:32,800
Why are you doing this? Are you getting old?

300
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:38,380
Girl, I can't even cry when I want to?

301
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:42,340
Gosh, don't cry. The dough will get salty.

302
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:44,870
I didn't cry.

303
00:26:45,670 --> 00:26:46,450
You're crying.

304
00:26:46,450 --> 00:26:50,070
- Why are you getting all teary-eyed?
 - I'm not.

305
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:52,500
You're making me lie.

306
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:54,850
Don't! Just do this.

307
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:57,190
Aren't you tired?

308
00:26:57,190 --> 00:26:59,250
It's okay.

309
00:27:04,870 --> 00:27:07,300
What is it you want?

310
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:12,130
Please stop Prosecutor Oh Ha Ra.

311
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:22,940
How about lunch?

312
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:25,870
I'm not that hungry.

313
00:27:25,870 --> 00:27:28,410
I was curious every time I saw this heart shape.

314
00:27:28,410 --> 00:27:31,530
What does it mean when you say your heart beats slow?

315
00:27:31,530 --> 00:27:34,510
Who knows? I don't.

316
00:27:34,510 --> 00:27:36,440
You said it not even knowing what it means?

317
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:40,570
My father told me that when I was young.

318
00:27:40,570 --> 00:27:44,830
The power of childhood education? How you learned to con before you learned your multiplication tables?

319
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:50,250
I guess it means not to get nervous or anxious under any circumstances.

320
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:06,990
You know what? I hated Children's Day ever since I was young.

321
00:28:06,990 --> 00:28:10,740
That's the day I received my father's death certificate.

322
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:17,800
While other kids went to amusement parks and ate cotton candy,

323
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:20,590
I didn't have anyone to play with me.

324
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:27,740
Fine, this children's day, I will go with you.

325
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,620
I have someone to go with though.

326
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:32,370
Who?

327
00:28:32,370 --> 00:28:35,620
It's a secret. I'll tell you after work.

328
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:37,620
How petty.

329
00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:42,070
I don't like amusement parks.

330
00:28:42,950 --> 00:28:44,380
Yet you want to go.

331
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:46,300
No.

332
00:28:58,770 --> 00:29:00,870
Who is it?

333
00:29:13,390 --> 00:29:17,940
My introduction has been delayed. I'm Sa Ma Cheon.

334
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:30,280
Sa Ma Cheon?

335
00:29:31,410 --> 00:29:35,820
 His name is Sa Ma Cheon. He's three strikes against him for robbery and fraud. 

336
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:37,850
 He's an infamous con artist in this world. 

337
00:29:37,850 --> 00:29:42,470
 He's the one who killed my daughter? 

338
00:29:43,390 --> 00:29:49,540
You're... You killed my daughter... My daughter. That Sa Ma Cheon?

339
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:52,500
First, please listen to me.

340
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:56,740
Then you may decide if you want to kill me or not.

341
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:07,750
You were about to get into a taxi, but Geum Tae Woong offered to pay double for his fare all of a sudden.

342
00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:09,650
I heard you missed that taxi because of that.

343
00:30:09,650 --> 00:30:11,940
What are you talking about right now?

344
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:18,570
Governor, not catching that taxi. No, for not being able to get on that taxi, you should consider yourself fortunate.

345
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:22,780
Because that taxi had a bomb.

346
00:30:23,550 --> 00:30:26,450
It will explode soon.

347
00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:30,180
Who are you? Who the heck are you that...

348
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:33,830
Geum Tae Woong was after your money.

349
00:30:33,830 --> 00:30:39,910
He married your daughter even though he had a wife and child. Did you know that?

350
00:30:40,810 --> 00:30:42,910
 A detective? 

351
00:30:45,150 --> 00:30:48,220
 How dare you come after my daughter? 

352
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:52,610
 Are you ambitious or are you just thick-skinned? 

353
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:57,790
 This is the seed money I prepared for the marriage. Please take a look at it. 

354
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:06,240
 This is circumstantial evidence that the opposing party candidate Park Soo Yeong murdered his secretary blinded by love. 

355
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:11,020
 If you reveal this, you will win the election with a landslide. 

356
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:23,780
In the end, he did marry her after you acknowledged his capability.

357
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:27,150
When the fact that he had a hidden wife and child was revealed,

358
00:31:27,150 --> 00:31:30,190
he killed your daughter.

359
00:31:30,190 --> 00:31:32,520
Do you have evidence?

360
00:31:36,050 --> 00:31:41,620
This is the ring I took from Geum Tae Woong's hand.

361
00:31:55,570 --> 00:32:00,540
Geum Tae Woong, that bastard!

362
00:32:15,450 --> 00:32:17,840
Oh, good. Okay!

363
00:32:27,270 --> 00:32:32,000
