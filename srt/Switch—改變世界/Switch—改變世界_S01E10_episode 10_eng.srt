1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,780
If you do this, it's hard on you, me, and everyone else here.

2
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:07,840
We already have the evidence. You know better.

3
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:12,330
Doesn't your mouth taste funky when you don't talk for such a long time? Should I give you some water?

4
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:15,460
You're so stubborn.

5
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:22,470
Please excuse us for a moment.

6
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:24,570
Yes, I understand, Mr. Prosecutor.

7
00:00:31,450 --> 00:00:39,470
 Timing and

8
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:03,810
 Do you think Sa Do Chan played the role of my avatar  

9
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:06,180
 without any intent to gain personally? 

10
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:11,370
Prosecutor, Choi Sang Hyeon said that he's ready to talk.

11
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:27,100
To transport the drugs,

12
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:34,610
I was ordered by the VIP (the President).

13
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:43,990
 Don't you know who the VIP is? Huh? 

14
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,380
It was the order of the President.

15
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:09,850
 Pressroom 

16
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:17,900
 This is shocking news. 

17
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:20,410
 According to a Prosecutors' Office insider,  

18
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:22,520
 most of the money from the drug smuggled by the former diplomat Choi Sang Hyeon 

19
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,680
 during the last election season, 

20
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,900
 he confessed that the funds went into the campaign. 

21
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:29,930
 This is against the President's strong motto  

22
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:33,440
 of getting rid of corruption in politics.  

23
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,610
 Everyone is focused on the aftershock. 

24
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:38,470
 Former Assistant Secretary Choi Sang Hyeon was working  

25
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:41,010
 as a diplomatic relations advisor for President Kang Han Jib during his campaign. 

26
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:45,140
 According to a Prosecutors' Office insider, Mr. Choi brought in drugs in the diplomatic pouch from Columbia... 

27
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:49,430
 They believe he delivered to someone in the presidential campaign camp. 

28
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:55,990
An insider from prosecutor's office revealed.

29
00:02:55,990 --> 00:02:58,300
Is it true that Choi Sang Hyeon has connections to the President?

30
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:00,690
Is it true that the President ordered the smuggling of the drugs?

31
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:02,820
Are you going to investigate the President as well?

32
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:07,590
The Prosecutor's Office will investigate without regard to the level of anyone's position.

33
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:11,610
We'll conduct the investigation according to the law.

34
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:13,860
Please wait.

35
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:17,030
Give us more details.

36
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:22,950
First of all, calm your nerves. Relax, relax!

37
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:29,780
With a chunk of meat thrown at them, the press is tearing it apart like a pack of dogs.

38
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:34,130
We just have to marinate it and turn it over to Special Counsel.

39
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:38,250
Hey, what are you doing, Prosecutor Oh? You're being rude in front of Chief Prosecutor!

40
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:40,810
Was it your order, Chief Prosecutor?

41
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:43,940
Don't you have any ethics as a prosecutor, Sunbae?

42
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:46,570
How can you leak it to the press without any strategy?

43
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:48,270
Did I make it up?

44
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:49,960
You heard it with me.

45
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:52,490
Choi Sang Hyeon's testimony has no credibility.

46
00:03:52,490 --> 00:03:55,250
Whether it's false or not, we have to fact check first!

47
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:59,370
And even if it's true, you should've made the announcement after discussing it with the team leader of the special investigation team.

48
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:06,170
Prosecutor Oh, the President is also a suspect.

49
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:13,000
Now, take your hands off the case.

50
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:27,310
The blaze is now towards the president.

51
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:32,170
Chief Prosecutor declared his intention to go after whomever it may be regardless of the person's position.

52
00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:41,040
Sit down.

53
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:53,320
Secretary Kim, what do you think about Prosecutor Jeong Do Yeong?

54
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:56,310
He passed the bar when he graduated from the Seoul National University Law school.

55
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:58,290
Parents also have a legal background.

56
00:04:58,290 --> 00:05:02,950
According to society's standards, isn't he someone who lacks nothing?

57
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:09,800
The chief prosecutor still hasn't let his guard down toward you yet.

58
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:12,080
since he is seeing you at a secret meeting only.

59
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:15,440
He's very tight in managing his network around him.

60
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,950
He's preparing for what may come.

61
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:22,800
That's why I like him.

62
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,410
He's the perfect person to use as my avatar.

63
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:35,700
Ambition with an outstanding background and a good sense of justice.

64
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:41,240
A person who also knows how to be a little corrupt,

65
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:45,680
but someone who's precise with his management.

66
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:52,140
Are you going to invite him to the Namsan Club?

67
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:54,580
The Governor will invite him soon

68
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:57,660
because Chief Prosecutor's the most suitable person.

69
00:05:58,470 --> 00:06:03,170
Namsan Club will prepare the stage and string the lines

70
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:06,580
and it will start a marionette performance.

71
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:14,450
But in the end, I will be the one holding onto the strings.

72
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:20,820
Because I will make them move with my fingers.

73
00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:29,610
In the end, the world that I want...

74
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:33,650
The world that I control...

75
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:37,760
I will make it.

76
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:57,710
Special Counsel?

77
00:06:57,710 --> 00:07:00,100
Because the President was involved in the drug case,

78
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:02,050
it looks like a special counsel is going to handle the case.

79
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:05,300
I heard that my daughter was in a special investigation or something for the drug case.

80
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:07,180
What is this "special counsel" about?

81
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:10,380
You know how prosecutors are civil servants?

82
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:14,000
It must be burdensome for civil servants to investigate the President, right?

83
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,650
So, they ask a civilian attorney to act as the prosecutor

84
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:19,950
and have him investigate the case. That's what you call a special counsel.

85
00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:23,300
A civilian works as a prosecutor?

86
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:25,800
Isn't it a fake prosecutor?

87
00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:29,970
It's not a fake prosecutor.

88
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:32,420
You can say that it's a temporary prosecutor

89
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:34,100
who has been specially appointed by the law.

90
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:38,320
Then, what happens to the special investigation team that my daughter is part of?

91
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:41,350
They have to hand it all over to the Special Counsel Team.

92
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:44,470
I heard the team will be formed at the new building in Teheran road.

93
00:07:44,470 --> 00:07:46,410
All the investigation files and everything else would probably go there.

94
00:07:46,410 --> 00:07:51,660
Awww, they made my daughter suffer from working in a special investigation team or something but now they kicked her off of the case?

95
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:55,180
They do whatever they want to do.

96
00:07:58,730 --> 00:08:01,980
 Office of the Special Counsel  

97
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:04,570
 Are you going to investigate the President's illegal funds? 

98
00:08:04,570 --> 00:08:05,890
What's your plan?

99
00:08:05,890 --> 00:08:08,760
- Do you have any plan? 
- I will give you a special briefing later.

100
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:11,020
We're from the Special Counsel Team.

101
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:15,910
Please hand over the files.

102
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:21,450
Here you go.

103
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,830
 Please tell us. 

104
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:27,380
 How do you feel right now? 

105
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:30,750
 Illegal Funds for Presidential Campaign
 Office of Special Counsel  

106
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:34,470
 What are some movements of the Special Prosecutor Team? Please tell us. 

107
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:42,150
 Diplomatic Pouch Drug Smuggling Special Investigation Team 

108
00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:27,280
Chief Prosecutor, welcome.

109
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:30,290
Welcome!

110
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:36,060
I am Jeong Do Yeong. Nice to meet you.

111
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:44,600
You all heard about our Prosecutor Jeong Do Yeong's impressive activity, right?

112
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,220
Yes.

113
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:53,540
In our Namsan Club, we will make Prosecutor Jeong Do Yeong king.

114
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,900
Now, now.

115
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:09,150
Why is the wine so good especially today?

116
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,950
We've selected the lawyers for the special counsel team.

117
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:20,140
All we have to do now is just get rid of him (the President).

118
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:26,270
Then, an early election will also be possible.

119
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:29,230
An early election? Right.

120
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:32,070
An early election would also be possible, right?

121
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:34,530
That's right.

122
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:39,220
While we're at it, you all keep this in mind.

123
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:42,310
You shouldn't rely on justice when it comes to politics.

124
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:46,310
Justice is a theory of black and white.

125
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:50,970
Whether it's misunderstanding or whatnot, it's game over if  s*** water splashes on you.

126
00:10:50,970 --> 00:10:54,440
Then, what should we rely on?

127
00:10:56,470 --> 00:11:04,000
Fantasy. If you promise them a good life, even if there are flaws on you

128
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:09,560
people turn a blind eye. That's a special characteristic of people who went through a war.

129
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:11,820
Do you understand?

130
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:15,380
You're right. I will keep that in mind.

131
00:11:16,650 --> 00:11:18,410
Now, now, now.

132
00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:26,030
Aigoo, this is good.

133
00:11:45,130 --> 00:11:47,840
- Governor, be careful going home. 
 - Okay.

134
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:56,240
Prosecutor.

135
00:11:56,930 --> 00:11:59,830
How about going for another round with me?

136
00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:01,640
Shall we?

137
00:12:06,570 --> 00:12:11,350
Governor, Chairman Victor came to Korea from Russia today.

138
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:13,860
Oh, Chairman Victor?

139
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:18,660
Okay, you go and meet him.

140
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:23,360
Instead, don't tell Geum Tae Woong.

141
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,080
You understand?

142
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:27,820
I understand.

143
00:12:32,070 --> 00:12:36,340
Chief Prosecutor, congratulations on your successful debut.

144
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:40,770
It's all thanks to you, CEO Geum. I won't forget your hard work.

145
00:12:40,770 --> 00:12:45,770
Whether it's holding the lighting or pulling the rope from backstage, I will do everything.

146
00:12:45,770 --> 00:12:51,280
Whether it's personal connections or funds, I will provide you with everything.

147
00:12:52,890 --> 00:12:58,980
Our relationship as a prosecutor and detective has brought us this far.

148
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:04,470
Instead, you can't forget the Incheon incident that happened 6 years ago.

149
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:17,500
Don't misunderstand. Since I am a businessman, I am accounting for my insurance.

150
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:24,750
When one becomes the star, all the staff members who worked so hard for him in the past...

151
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:28,200
There are so many people who forget about them.

152
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:51,630
 For smuggling drugs inside the presidential diplomat pouch 

153
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:53,700
 former diplomat Choi Sang Hyeon 

154
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:58,750
 left Han River Detention Center today and is being transported to Special Counsel's Office on Teheran Road. 

155
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:01,700
 An insider of the Special Counsel Team reported that they are investigating former diplomat Choi's claim 

156
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:04,500
  about  smuggling drugs in accordance with the order from the President... 

157
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:07,680
The special prosecutor will take care of the investigation from this point on.

158
00:14:08,310 --> 00:14:11,880
I'm going to go play a game of Janggi.

159
00:15:05,130 --> 00:15:10,220
You're going to give up your rook and get my knight?

160
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:15,270
Since you use your knights so often, I thought I should get your knights first.

161
00:15:15,270 --> 00:15:17,870
It was a valuable knight.

162
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:36,360
Aren't you going to make your move?

163
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:38,130
Is it my turn?

164
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:47,080
 Secretary Kim 

165
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:54,360
Yes, Secretary Kim.

166
00:15:55,010 --> 00:15:57,470
Right. Where?

167
00:15:58,510 --> 00:16:00,490
Oh, no...

168
00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:04,570
Take care of it well, so there's no damage.

169
00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:08,940
Is something wrong?

170
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:14,490
Looks like there was a small accident during the transport of some artwork.

171
00:16:14,490 --> 00:16:16,040
If you say an accident...

172
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:19,950
It looks like it got a scratch during transport, but we can have an expert to restore it.

173
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:23,710
Of course, the value of the artwork will fall a bit.

174
00:16:23,710 --> 00:16:26,980
It happens quite often when you run a gallery.

175
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:28,660
I see.

176
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:30,030
Let's play.

177
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:42,930
Choi Sang Hyeon escaped?

178
00:16:42,930 --> 00:16:47,290
Yes, there was a car accident and he ran away in the midst of it.

179
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:54,280
I'll be right back.

180
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:59,400
Celebrating the 60th birthday of Chairman Kim Choon Gap of Banpo Tennis Club...

181
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:05,750
President Hwang Beom Do of Dongyeong Mills will be giving a congratulatory speech.

182
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:07,680
President, please step forward.

183
00:17:17,190 --> 00:17:21,110
Yes. Who is Chairman Kim Choon Gap?

184
00:17:21,110 --> 00:17:27,210
He worked hard night and day with me for the development of Banpo.

185
00:17:27,210 --> 00:17:28,740
Applause.

186
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:36,750
You play tennis for your health.

187
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:39,680
For the health of Banpo

188
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:44,850
should I become the assemblyman of this city, everyone?

189
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:53,600
Yes.

190
00:17:55,130 --> 00:17:59,200
Please enter.

191
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:08,420
What? What's wrong?

192
00:18:09,190 --> 00:18:11,370
Geez.

193
00:18:23,490 --> 00:18:25,310
 010-1695-7777 

194
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:27,850
Hello?

195
00:18:27,850 --> 00:18:30,020
Yes, President, it's me.

196
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,180
Who did you say you are?

197
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:47,110
It's me, me. Choi Sang Hyeon. Choi Sang Hyeon.

198
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:52,810
I came to the place you told me to be. What shall I do now?

199
00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:57,900
What are you talking about?

200
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:01,470
 There is no person I know under the name, Choi Sang Hyeon. 

201
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:04,570
 What kind of crap is that? 

202
00:19:04,570 --> 00:19:06,400
 President Hwang, isn't that you who had me escape? 

203
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:10,970
See, you've got the wrong number. I will hang up.

204
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:15,260
Okay. We got it.

205
00:19:20,170 --> 00:19:21,120
Hello.

206
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:25,970
Customer, please pick up the item you ordered.

207
00:19:25,970 --> 00:19:28,300
Okay. Where shall I go?

208
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:31,860
It's Banpo Merit Hotel.

209
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:34,850
Okay. I got it.

210
00:19:34,850 --> 00:19:37,550
I am sorry. I have an item I need to get urgently.

211
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:40,170
Shouldn't we end the battle to see who's the winner?

212
00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:43,210
Let's postpone it until later.

213
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:57,670
What did you say about Choi Sang Hyeon?

214
00:20:07,890 --> 00:20:10,390
Did you find Choi Sang Hyeon?

215
00:20:10,390 --> 00:20:14,110
I have been looking for him with every line I can think of.

216
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:19,240
Who on earth snatched Choi Sang Hyeon?

217
00:20:20,050 --> 00:20:21,870
Who?

218
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:34,230
I came in. Where should I go?

219
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:36,180
W-W-Wait.

220
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:39,910
Birthday. I heard a birthday song.

221
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:49,210
- Birthday song? Did you hear that?
 - No.

222
00:20:49,210 --> 00:20:51,500
 'Banpo Tennis Club,' Chairman Kim Choon Gap's 60th Birthday Banquet 

223
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:56,380
Okay, Prosecutor Oh. You're sharp.

224
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,430
All right. Shall we find out who the owner of that mutt is?

225
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:13,380
Don't.

226
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:14,370
What did I do?

227
00:21:14,370 --> 00:21:17,170
I said not to do stuff like that.

228
00:21:17,170 --> 00:21:19,050
Don't go on any strange mission.

229
00:21:19,050 --> 00:21:23,020
Don't do that switch or setting stuff that you like to do so much!

230
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:27,700
If you let loose that son of a b**** Choi Sang Hyeon, I'm sure he'll go looking for his owner who fed him.

231
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:30,770
But how would we let him loose? Cause a car accident?

232
00:21:30,770 --> 00:21:33,920
Then, he'd run away and go looking for his owner!

233
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:35,780
But that's illegal.

234
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:41,030
Because I'm a prosecutor, I can't do anything even if I think of an idea like that!

235
00:21:59,030 --> 00:22:02,240
Prosecutor Oh, she's almost as good as a con artist now.

236
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:05,640
Did she get it from me?

237
00:22:08,810 --> 00:22:12,900
 Reservation Desk 

238
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:22,050
 You first have to give Choi Sang Hyeon a message of hope. Don't you think? 

239
00:22:22,050 --> 00:22:23,560
Excuse me.

240
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:28,180
These are the words of truth. Go and be words of life.

241
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:04,000
 Control the timing on the signals. As for the dump truck, call the expert. 

242
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,020
 Just hit it enough for it to fall over. 

243
00:23:47,770 --> 00:23:50,650
  Director Bong, release his handcuffs. 

244
00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:58,380
 And put just enough gasoline in the truck 

245
00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:01,770
 so that he won't go too far. 

246
00:24:27,610 --> 00:24:31,400
 Call from the public parking lot on Sadang intersection. 

247
00:24:36,650 --> 00:24:39,450
 Eun Ji, follow him on a motorcycle 

248
00:24:39,450 --> 00:24:42,700
 since we don't know where that mutt will run to. 

249
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:09,740
Eun Ji, let's send a runaway student back to his school (meaning jail).

250
00:25:27,090 --> 00:25:28,660
Oh, my...

251
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:30,200
You're supposed to faint.

252
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:32,110
Who are you?

253
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,950
Geez.

254
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:54,030
I'm in the banquet hall. Call that number again.

255
00:25:54,030 --> 00:25:55,930
Okay.

256
00:26:04,710 --> 00:26:09,700
I told you I don't know who Choi Sang Hyeon or whomever that is!

257
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,760
That crazy bastard. Why is he calling me? Hey.

258
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:15,890
Yes.

259
00:26:15,890 --> 00:26:17,110
Throw this into the Han River.

260
00:26:17,110 --> 00:26:18,940
Yes, sir.

261
00:26:52,210 --> 00:26:55,610
I found him. The Brown Bear.

262
00:26:55,610 --> 00:26:58,380
- Yes! 
 - Brown bear.

263
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:23,580


264
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:26,510
♫  Crazy other world  ♫

265
00:27:26,510 --> 00:27:30,400
♫  Crazy&nbsp; A Choice like fate  ♫

266
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:33,390
♫  The things that are happening  ♫

267
00:27:33,390 --> 00:27:35,560
♫  Everything is taken for granted now  ♫

268
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:37,310
 Switch 

269
00:27:37,310 --> 00:27:39,220
 Help the defendant escape illegally? 

270
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:40,240
 Does that make sense? 

271
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:43,020
 All you're doing is think about fighting in here. Isn't that why you keep losing? 

272
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:47,260
 One of them is too tenacious and the other one is too relaxed. 

273
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:48,400
 Can't I mix them up? 

274
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:49,730
 We received an urgent message from the prosecutors' office. 

275
00:27:49,730 --> 00:27:53,110
 Please transport the items that are hidden in the vacation villa swimming pool to the storage in Jecheon. 

276
00:27:53,110 --> 00:27:54,210
 We have a warrant. 

277
00:27:54,210 --> 00:27:59,010
 You know nothing is free in the world, right?  Nothing should happen to Mr. Hwang. 

278
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:00,990
 Sunbae, they got me. 

279
00:28:00,990 --> 00:28:03,430
 The con artist Sa Do Chan totally stabbed me in the back! 

280
00:28:03,430 --> 00:28:06,880
 Then, you want me to believe such nonsense? 

281
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:09,010
 The drugs. He was after the drugs. 

282
00:28:09,010 --> 00:28:12,080
 Did he get us in the end?
