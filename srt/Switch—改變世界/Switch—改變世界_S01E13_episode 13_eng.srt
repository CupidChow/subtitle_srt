1
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:56,490
 Incheon City, Joongu Chinatown, Cheonji Motel Basement Room # 7 

2
00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:01,980
Hey! Who are you?!

3
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:04,060
What is it?!

4
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:06,110
Hey, catch him!

5
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,050
Hey, hey, hey...

6
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:15,310
Get him!

7
00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:18,610
Get him!

8
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:33,000
Get him!

9
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,520
Hey, geez... Go around.

10
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,260
Run!

11
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:49,450
 Timing and

12
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:15,120
- Please check inside.
 - Yes, ma'am!

13
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:18,440
What happened to Manager Jo?

14
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:20,910
Too late. They took him away.

15
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:23,200
Did you check the license plate number?

16
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:29,710
Are you okay?

17
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:38,070
 Do you think Sa Do Chan played the role of my avatar without any intent 

18
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:40,130
  for his own personal gain? 

19
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:42,200
Go somewhere with me.

20
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:47,560
- Let go!
 - Stay still!

21
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:50,760
Hurry up and lift your head. Shut up!

22
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:53,520
- Relax, man. 
 - Stay still!

23
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:56,390
- Put your head in. 
 - Let go, a**hole!

24
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:58,380
Hey!

25
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:00,140
Making it so hard...

26
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:03,320
Put it in!

27
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:05,830
Yes, CEO.

28
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:07,550
How did it go?

29
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:11,280
Almost done.

30
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,250
Bring him in.

31
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:17,460
I have to confirm something, that's why.

32
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:21,330
Hey!

33
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:25,180
Stay still! Raise your head!

34
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:27,480
Hey, c'mon!

35
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:45,160
Why did you want to come here?

36
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,290
This isn't your first time here right?

37
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:51,310
I came here during the investigation of drugs in the pool.

38
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:55,860
Not about the pool. I'm talking about inside this villa.

39
00:03:57,230 --> 00:04:01,920
Sa Do Chan, you already knew this place...

40
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,790
before you met me.

41
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:16,600
When you realized we were looking for Brown Bear,

42
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:20,590
your eyes changed. Your eyes definitely  wavered.

43
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:23,920
 We only know one thing. 

44
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:27,120
 His nickname. Brown Bear. 

45
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:32,000
The important thing now is your reason.

46
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:35,650
The reason why you're so desperate to find Brown Bear.

47
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:39,480
You almost died being dragged to the storage and getting hit by a metal pipe on the head.

48
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,660
You still came back saying you'll continue being a prosecutor.

49
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:44,090
You took away an amazing amount of drugs.

50
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:48,220
You used it to arrest Mr. Hwang without even flinching about how much it cost you.

51
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:51,740
Even though you were bleeding and hurt your shoulder,

52
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:56,450
why does it hurt you more that you lost the clue to catch Brown Bear?

53
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:05,580
You saw him here.  Brown Bear.

54
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:11,990
Brown Bear, don't do this.

55
00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:15,940
I didn't see him.

56
00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:19,070
I didn't see him!

57
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:26,100
I'm warning you. Don't try to dig too deep into my life.

58
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:33,120
I'm warning you. Don't treat Brown Bear driven by your personal feelings.

59
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,260
I decide the rule of the game.

60
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:37,500
The game?

61
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:41,920
You and me, weren't we playing a game?

62
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:45,520
Hide and seek.

63
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:49,360
Who is going to find Brown Bear first?

64
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:56,430
 Switch 

65
00:05:56,430 --> 00:06:00,360
 Hide well, I might see your hair 

66
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:04,760
  20 years ago, 1998 

67
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:14,840
This is so nice.

68
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:19,170
There's even a pool.

69
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:22,640
How is it? Do you like it?

70
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:25,760
Father, did you scam again?

71
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:28,490
I quit that. Starting today,

72
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:32,200
I'm going to manage this villa and we'll live together here. How about it?

73
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:35,750
- Really? 
 - Of course.

74
00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:37,970
Let's go.

75
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:45,430
It's so nice here.

76
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:55,420
Dad, look at that. Four, four, four, four.

77
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:56,670
Oh...

78
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:51,840
Do Chan.

79
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:59,130
Listen well. We're going to play hide and seek from now on.

80
00:07:59,130 --> 00:08:00,510
Hide and seek?

81
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:04,820
Until I say, "I can't find you. I give up."

82
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:07,860
Hide well. You can't come out. Never, okay?

83
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:10,310
What will you do for me if I win?

84
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:12,750
I'll live without conning people as you always wished.

85
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:14,430
You said you quit earlier.

86
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:18,200
This is for real. Promise me.

87
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:21,460
Really, for real. For real, right?

88
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:57,980
Do you know who this person is?

89
00:09:01,770 --> 00:09:03,670
The red underwear.

90
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:07,210
 Beautiful. As expected, I'm lucky when it comes to playing this game. 

91
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:10,760
 This. I have to wear this one. 

92
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:14,460
I do. I know him!

93
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:31,550
Lady, please give me some water.

94
00:09:33,290 --> 00:09:35,130
Now that I think about it,

95
00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:39,090
this is my first time eating at the same table as you.

96
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:44,700
- Director Kim. 
 - Yes, CEO.

97
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:48,900
Live like a family from now on, the two of you. Stop fighting.

98
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:52,960
- The Governor said— 
 - I don't need anyone to order me around.

99
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:57,500
I protect my own men. Got it?

100
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:03,800
CEO, but—

101
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:06,130
Go around together starting tomorrow.

102
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:08,540
With Director Kim?

103
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:12,280
Until you find the guy in the photo.

104
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:18,440
From now on, your life depends on whether you can find that guy in the photo or not.

105
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,330
Please trust me.

106
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:29,650
 President Hwang Beom Do of Dongyeong Mills who was arrested for smuggling and distributing an enormous amount of drugs  

107
00:10:29,650 --> 00:10:33,810
 was transported to Seoul Central Prosecutors' Office today for interrogation. 

108
00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:37,220
 This morning, the special counsel declared that Former Diplomat Choi Sang Hyeon's confession connecting the President to drugs 

109
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:39,430
 was false, without any evidence. 

110
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:43,730
 The special counsel will, of course, proceed with disbandment. 

111
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:52,260
 You sent your daughter to Vancouver, Canada to study abroad, right?  

112
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:56,760
  If you think of her safety, you should do that. 

113
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:08,360
Why do you keep bringing me in and making me repeat myself?

114
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:11,880
It's true that I'm Brown Bear.

115
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,540
Geez.

116
00:11:14,170 --> 00:11:16,320
The drugs were smuggled through the diplomatic pouch.

117
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:20,920
Hwang Beom Do, we have more than enough testimony and evidence to support that you distributed the drugs.

118
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:23,630
We have overflowing reasons for your arrest.

119
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:28,580
The person we're looking for is ultimately Brown Bear.

120
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:31,320
Who is Brown Bear?

121
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,830
I said it's me.

122
00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:36,090
I'm Brown Bear.

123
00:11:36,090 --> 00:11:38,560
But how come you don't have any money?

124
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:43,340
I'm sure you have several hundred billion won from selling drugs. Where did all that money go?

125
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:49,430
You were blackmailed, right? To confess that you're Brown Bear.

126
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,320
The one who told you to do it must be Brown Bear.

127
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:04,380
I have no idea what you're talking about.

128
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:08,610
I said I'm Brown Bear.

129
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:20,290
There's no other way with this, right?

130
00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:23,740
Just say that Hwang Beom Do is fully responsible for the drugs.

131
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:27,500
Just close this case.

132
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:34,390
And Baek Joon Soo and Oh Ha Ra. What are you going to do with those two kids?

133
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:38,250
Either fire them or demote them to an outer province.

134
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:42,180
Governor, that can actually backfire.

135
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:46,400
They're prosecutors who are receiving lots of attention, enough for the President to assign them to a task force.

136
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:50,040
So, what will you do?

137
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:52,190
Do you have a solution?

138
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:11,070
He keeps insisting that he's Brown Bear.

139
00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:13,200
They've started to cut off their tails.

140
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,120
I'm sure he's being blackmailed.

141
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,600
Did you find anything in Chinatown?

142
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,120
Did he get dragged to Brown Bear?

143
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:22,700
It will be bad if he turns up dead like Nam Seung Tae.

144
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:24,990
There was a leather belt at the scene.

145
00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:29,400
We only found a partial fingerprint on it. I think it'll take some time to identify it.

146
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:33,890
Aigoo... We have to find someone with some information soon.

147
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:41,440
What? Chief Prosecutor?

148
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,690
Oh, hey...

149
00:13:46,830 --> 00:13:50,000
I'll announce the result of our initial investigation

150
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,380
in the case of transporting drugs through diplomatic pouches.

151
00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:03,830
President Hwang Beom Do of Dongyeong Mills, in the case of diplomatic pouch

152
00:14:03,830 --> 00:14:07,820
drug smuggling, made a full confession accepting full responsibility for the drug organization.

153
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:12,570
With that, the Seoul Central District Prosecutor's Office

154
00:14:12,570 --> 00:14:15,290
is working at our full capacity in obtaining relevant evidence supporting his assertion.

155
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:18,640
With this, our investigation

156
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:22,130
will be transferred to the Violent Crimes Division from Criminal Investigation Division 6.

157
00:14:22,130 --> 00:14:25,630
We have decided to continue to conduct a tighter investigation.

158
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:42,670
Baek Joon Soo and Oh Ha Ra are the prosecutors on this case.

159
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:45,030
The prosecutors on the case haven't come to their conclusion yet.

160
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:47,680
Why did you make an announcement in advance, Chief Prosecutor?

161
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:52,170
We have his testimony and evidence. What more is there?

162
00:14:52,170 --> 00:14:54,130
End it with that.

163
00:14:54,650 --> 00:14:59,160
Did you get recruited by an external force?

164
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:05,370
Should I take this over personally and start the investigation from ground zero?

165
00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:07,450
I have to fly when I have my wings.

166
00:15:07,450 --> 00:15:11,740
If I don't, those wings will only become lumps.

167
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:20,020
Opportunities in life don't come by often.

168
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:29,800
I'll give you this position.

169
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:35,220
 Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office Chief Prosecutor, Jeong Do Yeong 

170
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:37,100
 Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office Chief Prosecutor 

171
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:47,630
Gate of Hell. It's in the middle of the Karakum Desert in Türkmenistan.

172
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:51,020
The fire that was started to prevent the spread of methane gas

173
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:54,670
has been burning for the last 45 years.

174
00:15:54,670 --> 00:16:00,670
Türkmenistan is one of the five major countries in the world with natural gas pockets.

175
00:16:00,670 --> 00:16:04,150
It  is around 17.5 trillion cubic meters.

176
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:10,400
You can go far as to say that the entirety of Turkmenistan is floating above the natural gas.

177
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:14,430
As soon as the factory construction is completed, we'll start drilling.

178
00:16:14,430 --> 00:16:18,190
When the gas is released, 100 times the invested amount—

179
00:16:18,190 --> 00:16:20,170
No, it's possible to make 1000 times that.

180
00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:23,750
If that's the level we're talking about,

181
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:26,200
the investors must be lining up.

182
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:29,270
Governor, Türkmenistan is a nation with a royal family.

183
00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:34,070
All the development and government bond rights are owned by the royal family.

184
00:16:34,070 --> 00:16:38,440
It's understood that there is a condition that calls for a backdoor deal with the investor.

185
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:40,650
A backdoor deal.

186
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:43,490
A certain amount of the profit

187
00:16:43,490 --> 00:16:47,000
will be turned over to the royal family. Is that right?

188
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,230
That's why I came.

189
00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:51,850
Someone who can find the next governing ruler.

190
00:16:51,850 --> 00:16:54,800
Looking for a great political leader.

191
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,070
The next government?

192
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:04,360
Mr. Victor, you know how to read people.

193
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:11,370
But in exchange, I have a condition.

194
00:17:11,370 --> 00:17:13,650
Ah, please speak.

195
00:17:13,650 --> 00:17:17,980
I'll have to meet the Turkmenistan royal family personally.

196
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:20,320
Ah, of course, you should.

197
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:23,450
I will set up a meeting.

198
00:17:26,530 --> 00:17:34,600
 Timing and

199
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:50,100
That drug incident causing so much headache,

200
00:17:50,850 --> 00:17:54,330
I think it's wrapping up.

201
00:17:54,330 --> 00:17:58,000
I'm going to think up a new business now.

202
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,400
If you say a new business...

203
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:04,510
Try to come up with about 100 billion won from the bank.

204
00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:08,060
A hundred... Did you say 100 billion won?

205
00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:11,690
To make a slush fund that's worth 100 billion won—

206
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:13,420
Do you own the bank?

207
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:16,700
You're the president only on the surface. Why are you rambling on so much?

208
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:20,130
Come up with it if I say so!

209
00:18:20,990 --> 00:18:23,040
I understand.

210
00:18:27,770 --> 00:18:29,010
Victor?

211
00:18:29,010 --> 00:18:31,790
I hear he's a businessman who is close to the Türkmenistan royal family.

212
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:36,100
I think he's thinking up some kind of a business with the Governor.

213
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:41,640
And the bank manager visited the Governor's home in secret.

214
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:44,930
I think the Governor gave him a secret order.

215
00:18:44,930 --> 00:18:50,330
Good job, Director Kim. Continue to monitor the Governor.

216
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:51,560
Yes, sir.

217
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:57,710
This old man, what is he thinking?

218
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:06,130
- Sunbae, aren't you embarrassed? 
 - About what?

219
00:19:06,130 --> 00:19:08,930
I thought the drug money went into the President's campaign.

220
00:19:08,930 --> 00:19:11,440
You released that news without fact checking, Sunbae.

221
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,500
And thanks to that, the world was turned upside down.

222
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:17,040
It was right then, but it's wrong now.

223
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:20,910
Why? Is there a problem with that?

224
00:19:24,050 --> 00:19:29,380
For me, today's breaking news is more important than tomorrow's truth.

225
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:39,360
That villa. It has nothing to do with Geum Tae Woong.

226
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:40,520
No connection?

227
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:45,870
I looked into the history of previous owners, but Geum Tae Woong wasn't one of them.

228
00:19:49,010 --> 00:19:50,990
1998...

229
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:53,070
 Owner: Choi Jeong Pil 

230
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:55,240
Choi Jeong Pil?

231
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:59,670
Choi Jeong Pil... Choi Jeong Pil who was born in 1948...

232
00:19:59,670 --> 00:20:02,120
The one who used to be a governor?

233
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:09,170
Ah, still the same. Nothing has changed.

234
00:20:19,890 --> 00:20:23,040
I did find what you were talking about. Please check.

235
00:20:29,050 --> 00:20:32,320
Geez, how can we know with this?

236
00:20:34,030 --> 00:20:35,600
Welcome!

237
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,350
Hello.

238
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:45,700
Aigoo.

239
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:49,550
Did you find that Red Underwear?

240
00:20:49,550 --> 00:20:53,300
The CEO let you live under the condition that you catch Red Underwear.

241
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:55,610
I just have to kill some time.

242
00:20:55,610 --> 00:20:58,080
Do you think Director Kim will stand back and watch?

243
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:06,210
That jerk. I'm going to step on him when I get a chance.

244
00:21:06,210 --> 00:21:09,990
Ah, CEO Geum ordered you to—

245
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:16,290
I know. I'm going to step on that Geum Tae Woong, that a**hole, too.

246
00:21:16,290 --> 00:21:18,430
When I get powerful...

247
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:23,420
I'll stomp on all of them.

248
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:37,100
I went to Hwang Beom Do's house. But I came back with only what they offered me.

249
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:39,890
I couldn't even open one drawer.

250
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:43,260
It's a poker game that's been planned out.

251
00:21:56,570 --> 00:22:01,640
Was it criminal law code 347, the law about fraud?

252
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:02,410
Excuse me?

253
00:22:02,410 --> 00:22:08,440
Ten years or less in prison or... I don't remember clearly.

254
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:13,290
Director Bong, do you know what kind of punishment a con artist receives when he's arrested?

255
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:14,990
Well, I'm not sure.

256
00:22:14,990 --> 00:22:19,280
I'm sure you were always interested in that regard. I guess you don't know it well.

257
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:21,230
Does he need to experience it himself to learn about it?

258
00:22:21,230 --> 00:22:26,720
Of course, we can't say that we're not ashamed of anything living under the sky.

259
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:30,380
But instead of using the legal means to discipline us,

260
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:32,590
with the mindset of cooperation and tolerance,

261
00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:37,130
if you would be lenient and generous considering our affinity for each other that we've built thus far.

262
00:22:37,130 --> 00:22:39,930
So frustrating.

263
00:22:39,930 --> 00:22:42,120
That Mr. Hwang, the flour man.

264
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:48,660
I'm sure he made tons of money, but I have no idea where all that money went.

265
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:52,540
Why are you asking us that? We have nothing to do with that.

266
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:59,560
This is Mr. Hwang's home.

267
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:06,850
With my character, I want to go into the house with a warrant. But it's not in our jurisdiction.

268
00:23:08,770 --> 00:23:11,470
I can neither conduct an official investigation

269
00:23:11,470 --> 00:23:15,880
nor sneak in unofficially.

270
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:22,710
We may be small but if we can contribute to the well being of our society,

271
00:23:22,710 --> 00:23:25,990
we can go back and forth between legal and illegal status ambiguously.

272
00:23:25,990 --> 00:23:31,020
I'm saying we can try to resolve your discomfort and whatnot.

273
00:23:34,570 --> 00:23:42,220
Then Sunbae Baek ... I mean, I'd like this to be kept from Sa Do Chan.

274
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:49,460
What was that? Did she ask us to do a setting?

275
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:50,850
Without Do Chan Oppa's knowledge?

276
00:23:50,850 --> 00:23:54,530
Prosecutor Oh, she's way up there.

277
00:23:54,530 --> 00:23:56,890
Let's get our costumes ready.

278
00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:01,830
What's this about?

279
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:05,380
We're from the CDC.

280
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:08,400
Forumtorum Dorsas is a level 1 venomous insect.

281
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,860
Show it to her.

282
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:12,260
Dangerous!

283
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:15,410
We received a report saying that it's proliferating at a rapid rate in this area.

284
00:24:15,410 --> 00:24:21,020
This causes acute bronchitis, pneumonia, rheumatoid arthritis... Are your joints okay?

285
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:24,450
Well? There's no way our house is affected.

286
00:24:24,450 --> 00:24:26,070
Over there!

287
00:24:26,070 --> 00:24:28,200
- Over here! 
 - Oh, my!

288
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:33,800
Wait, our house is fine.

289
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:36,230
Excuse me. Over there is...

290
00:24:36,230 --> 00:24:38,250
Why do you go into someone else's master bedroom?

291
00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:41,420
There's none of that at my house.

292
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:45,820
By chance, do you have a computer? It's warm, so it's a good habitat for the bugs.

293
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:50,090
We don't have kids, and I don't know how to use it well.

00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,950
Nice.

319
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:31,090
How come there are so many paintings?

320
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:34,930
♫  Crazy other world  ♫

321
00:26:34,930 --> 00:26:38,900
♫  Crazy&nbsp; A Choice like fate  ♫

322
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:45,110
♫  The things that are happening, everything is taken for granted now  ♫

323
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:52,560
How did it go?

324
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:55,090
Okay. Let's go.

325
00:26:55,090 --> 00:26:56,860
Go home.

326
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:06,270
 What did he say? Think about it. 

327
00:27:06,270 --> 00:27:10,060
 If you refuse the deal, I have no choice. 

328
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:13,630
 You killed my wife, Hyungnim, 

329
00:27:13,630 --> 00:27:16,390
 and killed yourself, okay? 

330
00:27:17,590 --> 00:27:20,140
 "You killed my wife and..." 

331
00:27:21,050 --> 00:27:22,360
 Owner: Choi Jeong Pil 

332
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:23,860
Choi Jeong Pil?

333
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:29,290
 Geum Tae Woong married Choi Jeong Pil's daughter and killed that woman, 

334
00:27:29,290 --> 00:27:32,920
 and he tried frame my father for it. 

335
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:37,280
 Dad, look at that. Four, four, four, four. 

336
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:39,680
April 4th.

337
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,700
Do Chan.

338
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:46,060
I delivered the thing to Prosecutor Oh.

339
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:47,520
Good job, everyone.

340
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:51,560
If we look into who provided funds for Mr. Hwang, we can find out who is behind him.

341
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:56,130
But Hyung, you know, I'm honestly curious about something.

342
00:27:56,130 --> 00:27:59,730
You said the money is where the drugs are. You said that, Hyung.

343
00:27:59,730 --> 00:28:02,080
And that's why you went into the prosecutors' office.

344
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:06,080
Mr. Hwang's drugs. Weren't we going to run away with them?

345
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:10,200
That's what I'm saying. Aren't you getting too much into playing the prosecutor?

346
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:12,200
You're always hanging around Prosecutor Oh.

347
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:14,200
I'm really disappointed in you, Hyung.

348
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:18,190
- It seems you have another secret that only Eun Ji and I don't know about.
 - Hey...

349
00:28:18,190 --> 00:28:20,760
Do Chan has a reason.

350
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:23,630
What's that? Why can't he tell us?

351
00:28:23,630 --> 00:28:28,580
If you're going to continue to hide that, I can't stay with this team.

352
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:31,440
Just trust Do Chan a little longer.

353
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:34,720
No. I'll tell them.

354
00:28:37,290 --> 00:28:40,890
Brown Bear. He's the one I've been looking for.

355
00:28:40,890 --> 00:28:42,430
What?

356
00:28:42,430 --> 00:28:45,060
My goal is to catch him.

357
00:28:50,370 --> 00:28:54,160
That's how I've come this far.

358
00:28:55,870 --> 00:29:00,030
I had no idea you had a story like that, Oppa.

359
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:03,130
Why didn't you tell us sooner?

360
00:29:03,130 --> 00:29:07,020
You rescued me when I got scammed.

361
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:15,400
Oppa, I'll heal your wound from now on.

362
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:17,600
Oppa...

363
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,920
Eun Ji. Hey, In Tae, she won't let him go.

364
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:22,090
Hey, Eun Ji!

365
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:40,630
Here it is.

366
00:29:40,630 --> 00:29:44,960
See? It's not April. It's June. 
  June 10, 1998 

367
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:50,720
On her way back home from helping out her father's election campaign for the assembly, Choi Mi Na

368
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,960
got into a car accident

369
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:55,280
and was killed instantly.

370
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:58,300
That's what the police who were dispatched said.

371
00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:00,900
Why isn't it April 4th?

372
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:04,960
Choi Jeong Pil's daughter Choi Mi Na. Did you find out where  she is buried?

373
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:09,660
Yeah, it's an ossuary in Chooncheon. I called and checked over the phone.

374
00:30:09,660 --> 00:30:13,500
Choi Jeong Pil comes by June 9th every year and holds an event.

375
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:16,260
Because he's such a huge political figure, they remembered his face.

376
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:19,870
How about Geum Tae Woong? Did he attend, too?

377
00:30:19,870 --> 00:30:24,390
He only brings his chauffeur with him. Choi Jeong Pil comes by quietly alone.

378
00:30:24,390 --> 00:30:28,940
Do Chan, I think you're wrong this time.

379
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:34,330
How could a father not remember his own daughter's memorial day?

380
00:30:38,030 --> 00:30:41,760
Why doesn't the last puzzle piece fit?

381
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:46,600
If I get this one right, this hide and seek is over.

382
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:50,030
He's clean. Clean.

383
00:30:50,030 --> 00:30:54,870
Hwang Beom Do. He laundered everything perfectly.

384
00:31:08,190 --> 00:31:10,930
- Inspector Yoon. 
 - Yes?

385
00:31:10,930 --> 00:31:15,000
- Please look into these paintings. 
 - Okay.

386
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:25,370
Prosecutor Baek, I'm going to work. Do you have anything you need?

387
00:31:25,370 --> 00:31:28,030
 Government ID 
 Baek Joon Soo 
 Supreme Prosecutors' Office 

388
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:30,840
Okay.

389
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:36,100
