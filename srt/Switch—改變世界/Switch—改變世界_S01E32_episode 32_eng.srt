1
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:07,000
 Case number gohap 20181099. 

2
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:15,080
 and violation of the Aggravated Punishment of Special Economic Crimes Act will begin. 

3
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:20,140
Prosecutor, please state the summary of your indictment against him.

4
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:27,670
The defendant Geum Tae Woong used the diplomatic pouch starting in 2014

5
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:32,060
to smuggle drugs illegally in order to increase his assets wrongfully.

6
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:34,900
He ordered the murder of Nam Seung Tae who informed the Prosecutors' Office about this.

7
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:38,290
He also murdered a witness Park Yeong Jin who was a foreign diplomat.

8
00:00:38,290 --> 00:00:43,580
 Also, he's charged with the murder of Gye Choon Sik disguising his death as suicide during the takeover of K-Savings Bank. 

9
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:49,120
He's charged with personally murdering Victor Jang and Sa Ma Cheon during the natural gas investment deal.

10
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:54,830
The prosecution indicts the defendant Geum Tae Woong for murders, instigation of murders and so on based on his violation of Criminal Law Article 250, Paragraph 1 murder.

11
00:00:54,830 --> 00:00:58,100
Article 31, paragraph 1, ordering murder.

12
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:01,560
Aggravated Punishment of Special Economic Crimes Act Article 3, Paragraph 1.1

13
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:07,510
Criminal Act Article 356.

14
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:09,090
That's all.

15
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:14,960
Defense, would you like to cross examine?

16
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:15,820
No.

17
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:20,480
But we request Jo Seong Doo as our witness.

18
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:29,690


19
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,690
 Witness 

20
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:38,430
Please turn on the video.

21
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:44,290
"Be sure to lock up Nam Seung Tae. We have to monitor him carefully."

22
00:01:44,290 --> 00:01:49,000
"Please put the money from drugs into the same account as usual."

23
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,390
Witness, who sent you those text messages?

24
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:55,720
Director Kim Hyeon Wook sent them to me.

25
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:59,890
If so, who hung Nam Seung Tae in Bookhansan?

26
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:06,060
Director Kim Hyeon Wook did.

27
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:11,720
As you see, defendant Geum Tae Woong never once gave out the witness Jo Seong Doo

28
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:15,020
any orders regarding this case.

29
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:21,140
This shows that all the plans and actions were taken by Kim Hyeon Wook.

30
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:23,080
That will be all.

31
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:55,630
Defendant, you told the Feel Gallery employee Kim Hyeon Wook

32
00:02:55,630 --> 00:03:00,590
to murder Nam Seung Tae, Park Yeong Jin, Gye Choon Sik, and Jeong Do Yeong, right?

33
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:07,720
Since when did the Prosecutors' Office ignore the principle of treating a defendant innocent until proven guilty and prioritizing the evidence?

34
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:10,500
Do you have evidence that I ordered him?

35
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:17,430
Then, are you saying Kim Hyeon Wook ordered all these things?

36
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:19,790
Yes, that's right.

37
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:24,800
It was also Director Kim Hyeon Wook who told the witness Jo Seong Doo to make his moves?

38
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:30,630
Yes. Tell Kim Hyeon Wook to come out and testify for himself.

39
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:36,680
Your Honor, that will be all.

40
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:47,590
Defense, will you question the witness?

41
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:50,140
No, we will not.

42
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:58,090
Prosecutor Oh... Why is she acting like that? Why doesn't she corner him more? What's wrong with her?

43
00:03:58,090 --> 00:04:03,120
I'm not sure. Don't you think there's a flip at the end or something?

44
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:16,280
Your Honor, may I question the witness Jo Seong Doo again?

45
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:17,870
I object!

46
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:21,970
There's no reason for the prosecutor to re-examine a witness who's finished with his testimony.

47
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:26,340
There's a concern that he could try to destroy the critical evidence that Jo Seong Doo has or he could be swayed.

48
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:28,980
A crucial piece of evidence?

49
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:31,020
Proceed.

50
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:47,070
Witness, you locked up Nam Seung Tae and assaulted him under Kim Hyeon Wook's order, right?

51
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:47,820
Yes.

52
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:51,980
Do you know how Nam Seung Tae died?

53
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:59,890
I killed him by involuntary manslaughter.

54
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:13,230
Are you admitting to a murder in this court?

55
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:17,890
Yes. I admit it.

56
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:25,190
Why did you lock up Nam Seung Tae?

57
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:34,580
Because Nam Seung Tae... had a video of a drug deal.

58
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:42,090
A video of a drug deal.

59
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:53,200
By chance, are you talking about this video clip?

60
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:56,160
Yes, that's right.

61
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:02,410
Your Honor, I'd like to submit this video clip as evidence #4.

62
00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:03,950
Your Honor, I object!

63
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:07,820
That video clip was not submitted as evidence during our preparation.

64
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:13,110
Your Honor, please consider the fact that the defendant continuously attempted to destroy evidence.

65
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:17,660
Just as Nam Seung Tae was locked up just for having this video clip,

66
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:22,220
we couldn't submit it in advance for the safety of the witness Jo Seong Doo.

67
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:23,720
I will allow it..

68
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,860
Continue.

69
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:10,260
The defendant shown here is the main culprit in all the murders and ordering of the murders.

70
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:13,850
He is the so-called Brown Bear. Is that right?

71
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:17,900
Yes, that's right.

72
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:20,120
He said Geum Tae Woong is the Brown Bear!

73
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:22,870
That means Geum Tae Woong did everything!

74
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:25,080
 I have a video clip. 

75
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:30,460
 If something happens to me, please reveal it to the world. 

76
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:35,450
 I got this from Director Kim. 

77
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:42,210
 I have something to give you. 

78
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:49,080
 Watch it when you get bored. 

79
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:58,600
You had said Kim Hyeon Wook ordered everything when Prosecutor Oh Ha Ra questioned you earlier. Why did you do that?

80
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:04,870
Because he told me to.

81
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:10,220
Who?

82
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:20,650
Geum Tae Woong.

83
00:08:34,850 --> 00:08:36,760
That's all.

84
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:16,390
 The day of Geum Tae Woong's verdict
 Seoul Central District Court 

85
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:24,120
The defendant Geum Tae Wong murdered Sa Ma Cheon and Victor Jang on May 3, 2018.

86
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:28,480
In order to hide that fact, he destroyed numerous pieces of corroborating evidence.

87
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:32,930
Besides, he stole billions of won from the banks.

88
00:09:32,930 --> 00:09:36,270
He manipulated the press. Also, to hide his crime,

89
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:40,090
he didn't hesitate to ask for favors from several prosecutors.

90
00:09:40,090 --> 00:09:43,860
He committed very grave crimes

91
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:46,420
and there seems to be no way of rehabilitating him.

92
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:50,450
So, as for the defendant Geum Tae Woong's murder and his other combined crimes

93
00:09:50,450 --> 00:09:53,990
which surfaced during the trial,

94
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:56,590
this court gives out the verdict as follows.

95
00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:03,500
Defendant Geum Tae Woong, for the charge of murder under Criminal  Law Article 250, paragraph 1.

96
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:05,750
Guilty.

97
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:14,500
Under Criminal Act Article 250, paragraph 1, and  Article 31, paragraph 1, instigating murder. Guilty.

98
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:20,710
As to the Aggravated Punishment of Specific Economic Crimes Act Article 3, Paragraph 1.1

99
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:27,950
and Criminal Act Article 356. Occupational Embezzlement.

100
00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:29,660
Guilty.

101
00:10:30,490 --> 00:10:36,210
For all the crimes for which he was charged with by the prosecution, he is found guilty.

102
00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:41,690
Therefore, this court sentences Geum Tae Woong

103
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:48,510
to death.

104
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:17,740
Death sentence? Death sentence?

105
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:21,060
I get a death sentence? Nonsense!

106
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:31,650
Sa Do Chan, Baek Joon Soo! How dare you mess with Brown Bear?

107
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:34,480
I'll drag you two with me to death!

108
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:38,920
I can't die alone! I can't! I won't!

109
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:01,660
 Seoul Central District Court 

110
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:06,380
Sa Do Chan!

111
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:13,190
Where are you going, Sa Do Chan?

112
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:16,690
I did my job, so I have to be on my way.

113
00:12:16,690 --> 00:12:19,330
You're going to leave like this?

114
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:26,250
Prosecutor Oh, do you remember when you first asked me to stand in for Baek Joon Soo?

115
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:34,720
We said we'll never see each other again after this job. I believe that's what we promised.

116
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:37,030
It's different now.

117
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:38,240
What's different?

118
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:43,520
That was because you kept stabbing me in the back. I got so mad.

119
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:50,690
But now, I feel so bad to let you go like this.

120
00:12:54,170 --> 00:12:56,090
Just a moment.

121
00:12:59,690 --> 00:13:01,580
It's a gift.

122
00:13:08,010 --> 00:13:12,270
It's a family album. One and only.

123
00:13:15,650 --> 00:13:21,570
Your father's last words... I hope you keep it.

124
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:30,360
"The biggest con is to gain one person's heart completely." He said, right?

125
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:49,960
Oh Ha Ra. A big con requires  a big setting.

126
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:55,450
Could you handle it?

127
00:14:35,930 --> 00:14:39,170
Meeting should be short. A farewell should be shorter.

128
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:40,150
Farewell?

129
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:43,080
Eun Ji, you have to go to the Maldives. You said you wanted to be a writer who writes about traveling.

130
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:47,460
In Tae, you start your internet business. Director Bong, you have to make movies and go to Cannes.

131
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:54,820
Right. I'll write your story... I mean, our story into a scenario.

132
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:57,310
Why did you give me so much for my business?

133
00:14:57,310 --> 00:15:00,490
Thanks, Hyung. It will be used well.

134
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:03,890
What if I want to see you?

135
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,950
Oppa.

136
00:15:11,770 --> 00:15:14,920
 Hangook Bank 

137
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:17,450
Let's split now.

138
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:28,990
♫  Your two eyes which glow like the setting sun pass by  ♫

139
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:31,410
Oppa.

140
00:15:31,410 --> 00:15:38,050
Hey! 
 ♫  Close your eyes and in your warmth wait and sleep on&nbsp;  ♫

141
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:45,750
Where are you going? 
 ♫  The lighthouse which stands alone in the dream  ♫

142
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:48,750
I have nowhere to go!

143
00:15:49,710 --> 00:15:51,390
♫  looks only for you who are lost  ♫

144
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:55,420
Director Bong!

145
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:58,450
Where do I go?

146
00:15:58,450 --> 00:16:03,190
I can't go to the Maldives by myself!

147
00:16:03,190 --> 00:16:07,880
♫  Raise me up though far away  ♫

148
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:12,370
♫  Stay with me  ♫

149
00:16:12,370 --> 00:16:20,090
♫  At my side, at my side  ♫

150
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:26,830
 Chief Prosecutor - Jin Gyeong Hui 

151
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:35,830
Let's go.

152
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,190
Yes, I understand.

153
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:52,850
Hey. Open the gate.

154
00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:55,450
I locked the exit.

155
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:58,470
My ID.

156
00:17:13,330 --> 00:17:18,890
Prosecutor Gil Dae Ro, come with us to Inspection Headquarters.

157
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:31,720
Jo Seong Doo.

158
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:35,750
I shouldn't have trusted you.

159
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:38,640
But I did.

160
00:18:40,910 --> 00:18:42,990
Because he is my kid.

161
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:45,720
 You know hell is  

162
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:53,430
 a world where you can't love anyone and trust no one. Don't you think that's what hell is? 

163
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:01,200
In the end, I...

164
00:19:02,650 --> 00:19:05,390
I created this.

165
00:19:06,930 --> 00:19:10,600
I created my hell.

166
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:28,830
No.

167
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:33,910
I don't trust anyone and don't fall for anyone either.

168
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:42,780
I'm Geum Tae Woong.

169
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:57,290
I said I'm Geum Tae Woong.

170
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:14,220
Geum Tae Woong.

171
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,320
Hey, pretty lady, come here.

172
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,210
Come here and try this.

173
00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:41,780
- Me? 
 - Is there anyone else who's a pretty lady here?

174
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:43,220
Thank you.

175
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:47,980
You ate it. 3,000 won.

176
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:54,780
Unni, you look like Audrey Hepburn as I look at you closely.

177
00:20:56,700 --> 00:21:00,920
Your eye brows. For real.

178
00:21:06,970 --> 00:21:09,970
See that? You have to do business like this, Ahjussi.

179
00:21:09,970 --> 00:21:11,460
Here.

180
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:13,860
You're so amazing.

181
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:16,660
Have a good day.

182
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:40,550
Honey, it's me.

183
00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:43,340
You said you were going to the Buddhist temple today, right?

184
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:48,050
When you go, put up around ten bills for offerings.

185
00:21:48,050 --> 00:21:53,080
Me? I have to go to church and give my thanks offering.

186
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:56,930
Yeah. Okay. Alright.

187
00:22:01,150 --> 00:22:04,360
 Deputy Prosecutor Yang Ji Soong 

188
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:19,290
 I have a favor to ask you. You know Mi Ran at the front desk? 

189
00:22:19,290 --> 00:22:23,120
Say "Pretty Mi Ran" when you say hi to her.

190
00:22:24,870 --> 00:22:28,530
Hello, Pretty Mi Ran.

191
00:22:28,530 --> 00:22:32,080
Yes, hello, Prosecutor Baek.

192
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:45,650
Free Hearted Foundation Chairman Choi Yeong Min.

193
00:22:45,650 --> 00:22:48,990
He gets brand name products donated by big corporations and designers.

194
00:22:48,990 --> 00:22:51,080
He's holding a large bazaar.

195
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:56,870
The problem is that he kept the donations given by the people all to himself.

196
00:22:56,870 --> 00:23:00,040
We have to obtain  critical evidence.

197
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:59,680
From a famous Japanese designer,

198
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:05,020
I thank you for donating to our bazaar.

199
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:11,550
If we put this in the auction, we'll be getting millions for sure.

200
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:16,010
Are you happy to be living stealing from other people? You bad bastard. (Speaking in Japanese)

201
00:24:16,010 --> 00:24:22,170
Mr. Ditaito says he's happy that he can be of help.

202
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:35,160
It's like casting pearls among the swine.

203
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:39,460
He'd like to give you these clothes as a gift.

204
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:44,280
The dressing room is over there.

205
00:25:23,410 --> 00:25:27,880
But is this outfit supposed to be like this?

206
00:25:28,730 --> 00:25:31,620
 I usually report only 20% of the donations given. 

207
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:34,780
 I deposit the rest of the money into my account which I own under a borrowed name. 

208
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:38,050
 No one knows about that money anyway. 

209
00:25:38,050 --> 00:25:40,470
We're from the Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office.

210
00:25:40,470 --> 00:25:42,770
Choi Yeong Min, you're under immediate arrest.

211
00:25:42,770 --> 00:25:44,960
- Please arrest him. 
 - Okay.

212
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,100
What the heck?

213
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:48,290
It's so gaudy. Stay still.

214
00:25:48,290 --> 00:25:50,320
Let's go!

215
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:57,420
 I usually report only 20% of the donations given. 

216
00:25:57,420 --> 00:26:00,560
 I deposit the rest of the money into my account which I own under a borrowed name. 

217
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:02,380
 No one knows about that money anyway. 

218
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:04,550
Sunbae, it's weird.

219
00:26:04,550 --> 00:26:07,980
The evidence came out as if it was waiting for us to show up.

220
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:12,780

221
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:16,710
