1
00:00:01,310 --> 00:00:03,250
Thanks.

2
00:00:03,820 --> 00:00:07,870
I think he believed he couldn't live even with surgery.

3
00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:12,760
So he wanted to have you live as Prosecutor Baek Joon Soo.

4
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:17,320
Prosecutor Baek dying and me living as him...

5
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:20,660
Living my life after someone else's sacrifice...

6
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:23,600
Oh, that sounds crazy just thinking about it.

7
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:27,330
Do you think I would've agreed to such a scenario?

8
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:30,830
Right. That's why I'm more grateful to you

9
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:34,450
for upgrading Sunbae Baek's scenario.

10
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:37,630
I hope his surgery goes well.

11
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:43,150
It will go well. The heavens can't be cruel only to Sunbae Baek.

12
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:45,220
I guess.

13
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:50,220
Sa Do Chan.

14
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:53,820
You're a good guy.

15
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:55,960
What? Out of the blue? Flattering me all of a sudden?

16
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:58,580
What? You listened to me well last time without being embarrassed.

17
00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:03,120
That's because I was pretending to be Baek Joon Soo. That's why I just heard you out.

18
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:08,770
I'm so glad you're the one who played the role of Sunbae Baek.

19
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:14,630
I don't think... I could've come this far all by myself.

20
00:01:17,290 --> 00:01:18,800
You mean it?

21
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:36,270
 Timing and

22
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:04,800
You're Inspector Go Gi Bong, right?

23
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,250
Yes. Who are you?

24
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:08,530
We're from the Inspection Headquarters  of the Supreme Prosecutors' Office.

25
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:10,770
Excuse me? Inspection Headquarters?

26
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:14,050
Please work with us for a minute.

27
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:15,250
Yes.

28
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:17,090
Come this way please.

29
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:35,490
Go Gi Bong, you're an inspector working directly under Baek Joon Soo.

30
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:38,750
But you didn't notice anything strange or the feeling that he's another person.

31
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:40,920
You didn't get that feeling?

32
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:46,550
We have evidence that you were more suspicious about Prosecutor Baek's identity than anyone else.

33
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:49,300
 Fingerprint Analysis 
You had asked for fingerprint analysis.

34
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:51,830
Yes, I did.

35
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:56,610
But it was a 99.9%.

36
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:59,800
Here. It says so here.

37
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:04,150
The inspector was suspicious of his prosecutor's identity?

38
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:09,830
Why? Why were you suspicious?

39
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:12,770
Well.

40
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:19,350
Because he was too nice of a guy.

41
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:26,280
Prosecutor Baek Joon Soo was so humane that I doubted him.

42
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:29,880
He was so different from other prosecutors that I've worked with.

43
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:32,450
Look! We're prosecutors, too.

44
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:34,850
What the heck are you talking about?

45
00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:42,260
Prosecutor Baek Joon Soo. He's a reallly good guy.

46
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:44,620
Please don't hurt him.

47
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:49,140
Look, that's not what we're asking.

48
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:53,290
Sa Do Chan. Impersonation of a prosecutor. Do you know this or not?

49
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:56,580
Answer either yes or no.

50
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:58,190
Yes.

51
00:03:58,190 --> 00:04:00,060
You knew?

52
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:01,910
No, no.

53
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:03,560
No?

54
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:08,270
If you're connected to this case,

55
00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:13,070
you'll have to account for grave legal liability. Including your dismissal.

56
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:17,470
You know you'll have to take off your uniform (leave your job), right?

57
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:22,570
Trust what I say!

58
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:30,670
I said our Prosecutor Baek is really a great man.

59
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:33,560
I will take off my  uniform.

60
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:38,970
You can't trust me? Want to see me?

61
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:43,310
 Supreme Prosecutors' Office Inspection Headquarters. 

62
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:55,170
 Prosecutor's Office 

63
00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:06,750
Prosecutor Baek. No, Sa Do Chan.

64
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:09,020
Please endure this.

65
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:13,290
I, Go Gi Bong, will protect you with my life.

66
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:15,840
Geez...

67
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:27,230
Inspector Go, what's up?

68
00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:33,660
Prosecutor Baek, I was dragged to a place.

69
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:36,520
Pardon? To where?

70
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:40,490
You have to keep this a secret.

71
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:43,930
I signed a confidentiality form saying that I won't say anything to anyone about this.

72
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:48,780
But I'll tell you only, Prosecutor Baek.

73
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:52,670
Where did you go that you're acting like this?

74
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,020
The Inspection Headquarters of the Supreme Prosecutor's Office.

75
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:05,820
You just have to put Geum Tae Woong behind bars.

76
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:08,760
I don't care what happens to me.

77
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:12,160
How much longer would I be able to live?

78
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:15,860
I'm fine even if I have to rot in jail the rest of my life.

79
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:20,950
Please get that evil Geum Tae Woong.

80
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:23,140
That's why I came to see you.

81
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:27,280
Please tell me every little thing if it's about Geum Tae Woong.

82
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:31,770
That Director Kim. Did he start talking yet?

83
00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:33,790
Not yet.

84
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:36,490
That tenacious bastard.

85
00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:39,630
What does he have to gain from Geum?

86
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:42,380
The K-Savings Bank manager,

87
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:46,200
I'm sure Director Kim killed him

88
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:48,500
under Geum Tae Woong's order.

89
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:51,170
Did Geum Tae Woong and Director Kim

90
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:54,870
use several untraceable cell phones for crime?

91
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:02,480
I know who opened the accounts for those phones.

92
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:05,290
I know.

93
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:10,870
I heard that those are from a Yeongdungpo branch President Yoon is running.

94
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:12,930
Go through that place.

95
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:15,360
Then, you will find the numbers Geum Tae Woon and Director Kim

96
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,890
are using under the borrowed names.

97
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,350
That'll be great help.

98
00:07:38,730 --> 00:07:40,720
- Yeah. 
 - You got my text, right?

99
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,700
The place where Director Kim initialized his untraceable phone.

100
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:45,800
Yeah. I'm on my way right now.

101
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,420
Sa Do Chan, you're quite amazing.

102
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:49,670
Managing to get Governor Choi Jeong Pil to work with you.

103
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:55,210
I guess I can't say that my charm is to attract anyone regardless of age and sex.

104
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:06,050
Prosecutor Oh, what's wrong?

105
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:13,130
Hello? Prosecutor Oh! Oh Ha Ra!

106
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:35,100
Oh Ha Ra! Oh Ha Ra! Oh Ha Ra! Oh Ha Ra!

107
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:38,000
Please wait here.

108
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:16,850
The dump truck driver was driving drunk in broad daylight.

109
00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:20,500
It doesn't make sense that a homeless man would be driving a dump truck.

110
00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:34,800
- Don't stop me. 
 - You can't go.

111
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,250
You shouldn't go see Geum Tae Woong right now.

112
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:37,900
I will go myself and take care of this!

113
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:40,110
I understand full well how you feel, Prosecutor Baek.

114
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:42,630
But this isn't it. If you go there and get yourself in troubleâ€”

115
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:45,970
Hurting Prosecutor Oh means he's trying to provoke me.

116
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:49,560
He's teasing me saying what can I do within the boundary of the law!

117
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:53,790
Don't stop me. I've reached my limit now.

118
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:59,420
Please. Please, don't do this.

119
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:01,940
Prosecutor Baek Joon Soo.

120
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:08,430
Now that Prosecutor Oh is in that condition, who would we rely on to move forward in our investigation if something should happen to you?

121
00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:12,200
He's right. And how else would we get Geum Tae Woong?

122
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:15,100
Joon Soo, I completely understand your reaction right now.

123
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:18,730
But if you go now will you kill him?

124
00:10:18,730 --> 00:10:23,560
It'd be easy if you could kill him. But how about me and Prosecutor Oh?

125
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:27,090
We didn't run all the way here to see such an ugly sight.

126
00:10:27,090 --> 00:10:29,100
We don't want to become the same as him.

127
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:31,590
We want to punish him according to the law somehow!

128
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:34,340
That's how we got all the way here struggling so much!

129
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:37,940
Prosecutor Baek, I beg you.

130
00:10:42,730 --> 00:10:44,570
Joon Soo.

131
00:11:00,530 --> 00:11:06,320
I guess this would serve as a warning.

132
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:18,270
People who were killed who were connected to Brown Bear.

133
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:22,880
We have to get a confession that Geum Tae Woong ordered him to do that in order to get to the bottom of their deaths.

134
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:28,070
In order to do that, we have to pressure Director Kim with concrete evidence.

135
00:11:28,070 --> 00:11:32,650
Inspector Go, this is a confiscated list of phones that I retrieved from the phone store where Director Kim activated phones under borrowed names.

136
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:36,440
Please look into the list and see to whom and where he called on the day of the murders.

137
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:38,030
Okay.

138
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:42,260
Inspector Im, please analyze autopsy reports on the victims.

139
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:44,730
I'm sure you'll find some inconsistencies or errors.

140
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:46,800
Yes, I understand.

141
00:11:58,610 --> 00:12:01,140
Ha Ra, are you okay?

142
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:03,220
Unni.

143
00:12:04,130 --> 00:12:08,870
Mom... So Ra...

144
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:10,880
She came to her senses.

145
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:13,890
She was unconscious due to the car accident.

146
00:12:13,890 --> 00:12:16,420
She has a minor fracture on her left elbow.

147
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:19,410
Considering it was a big accident, she's lucky.

148
00:12:19,410 --> 00:12:21,670
Thank you.

149
00:12:51,290 --> 00:12:56,950
I'm okay. Go and work on the investigation.

150
00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:05,190
Show Geum Tae Woong that you won't cower over this much.

151
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:09,900
People would think I'm a real prosecutor if someone overheard you.

152
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:17,280
You seem like a prosecutor especially now.

153
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:26,970
Prosecutor Gil Dae Ro!

154
00:13:31,130 --> 00:13:32,320
Who are you?

155
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,930
We're from the Bureau of Audit.

156
00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:36,140
I've never been asked for a favor.

157
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:41,020
All I did was go with him because he was my classmate.

158
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:42,360
No, that's not it.

159
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:46,850
Then, well, is this about that phone call I made?

160
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:51,050
Let's not do this. We're all on the same team.

161
00:13:51,050 --> 00:13:54,630
We're here for the impersonation of Prosecutor Baek Joon Soo case.

162
00:13:55,670 --> 00:14:01,260
Ah, geez. Then, I should fully cooperate.

163
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:03,300
Come with us.

164
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:11,130
I heard you were suspicious as to whether Prosecutor Baek was real or not.

165
00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:13,220
Well, I was a bit.

166
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:17,590
I was humiliated then because I was proven wrong

167
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:20,190
because he had a scar at that time.

168
00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:23,690
Didn't you make it an issue because you were suspicious about something?

169
00:14:23,690 --> 00:14:28,530
Not about that. Did you find anything else suspicious?

170
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:31,020
Well...

171
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:36,300
 This isn't something just anyone can do. You went to law school, huh? 

172
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:38,990
 You studied for the bar, right? 

173
00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:43,220
 How can you ask a prosecutor if he went to a law school or took the bar? What is this? 

174
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:45,940
 Is this a new type of humor? 

175
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:49,300
 This is a saji case (with no evidence or witness). You know how to handle this, right? 

176
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:55,000
 Since it's a saji case, I will tie up their saji (four limbs: homophone) and bring them here.    

177
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:01,840
Your meal is here.

178
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:05,860
- Thank you. 
 - Enjoy.

179
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:08,460
Thank you!

180
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:18,060
â™«  Excitement which comes riding on a puff of wind  â™«

181
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:18,910
Water.

182
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:22,310
Here.

183
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:28,960
â™«  That's how you blew into my mind  â™«

184
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:29,760
It's going well.

185
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:32,390
â™«  A thrill which was unfamiliar but not unlikeable  â™«

186
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:34,190
You have a good appetite even though you're sick.

187
00:15:34,190 --> 00:15:37,700
I'll eat well so I can catch Geum Tae Woong.

188
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:39,130
â™«  blow my mind  â™«

189
00:15:39,130 --> 00:15:41,660
My arm feels so weak.

190
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:52,920
â™«  Love which comes&nbsp;riding on the wind which is you  â™«

191
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:55,320
â™«  Rain falling on my desert like heart  â™«

192
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:57,640
Prosecutor Oh!

193
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:59,830
- Hello. 
 - Hi.

194
00:15:59,830 --> 00:16:02,770
- Here is the file you asked for. 
 - Thank you.

195
00:16:02,770 --> 00:16:06,420
If you're craving those noodles you like so much, where was it from?

196
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:08,560
Ah, Taejin's Noodles. Should I get some for you?

197
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:11,110
- Yes. 
 - Give me money.

198
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:12,920
Just kidding.

199
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,160
You look much better than before.

200
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:17,940
Yes, I feel better.

201
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:18,650
Your neck...

202
00:16:18,650 --> 00:16:27,190
â™«  Love which is like a miracle to me, How did it shake my everything so easily?  â™«

203
00:16:27,190 --> 00:16:29,560
Clean these for me.

204
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:36,440
â™«  My easy life is so special  â™«

205
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:44,410
Prosecutor Oh, I feel like you're using me more than you have to.

206
00:16:44,410 --> 00:16:45,520
I'll do it.

207
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:48,620
â™«  blow my mind  â™«

208
00:16:54,970 --> 00:16:56,550
There.

209
00:16:56,550 --> 00:16:58,440
Thank you.

210
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:09,690
The entire 200 billion won has been deposited as payments for the automobiles.

211
00:17:09,690 --> 00:17:13,720
My babies are back finally, huh?

212
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:15,300
Yes.

213
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:21,300
There's not that much tax because of the antique goods law. Should I report it right away?

214
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:24,190
Turn all that cash into checks.

215
00:17:24,190 --> 00:17:28,200
Checks? It will be traced.

216
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,300
Take the money and gamble away the money on Gangseon Land.

217
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:33,000
CEO. I quit gambling.

218
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,380
I know this Director Song at Gangseong Land.

219
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:38,560
I'll call him. Go and meet him.

220
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:43,090
CEO, don't you trust me? I really quit gambling.

221
00:17:46,170 --> 00:17:51,390
Didn't I tell you I'll teach how to gamble legally?

222
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:54,730
Go and do as I say.

223
00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:06,640
Oh Ha Ra returns. Oh, what charisma.

224
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:10,510
I'm going to destroy the bastard who put a crack in my bone.

225
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,760
Everyone.

226
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:18,400
Prosecutor!

227
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,910
I'm back.

228
00:18:20,910 --> 00:18:23,890
Prosecutor, you should've rested longer.

229
00:18:23,890 --> 00:18:28,180
I have no time to rest. Did your trip to Busan go okay?

230
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:32,600
Yes. The apartment was awesome.

231
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:37,090
You can see the Haewoondae beach at a glance. It's worth two-billion won.

232
00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:41,190
But that apartment doesn't belong to Director Kim's mother.

233
00:18:41,190 --> 00:18:45,610
A week after she moved in, the title was put under the provisional attachment. ( A court issued attachment of property at the request of a creditor. )

234
00:18:45,610 --> 00:18:46,560
A provisional attachment?

235
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:50,700
Yes, there are five people on the title of that apartment

236
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:53,830
with all the employees at Feel Gallery.

237
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:58,500
He pretends it's a gift, but made sure he can get it back whenever he wants it back, huh?

238
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:00,100
It's a trick, so to speak.

239
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:02,870
So petty and detailed.

240
00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:07,200
They say the gangsters work hard. They're even so diligent.

241
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,700
On top of that, they don't sleep there.

242
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:14,890
Prosecutor, Director Kim. Oh, you're back.

243
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:18,200
I have the call list on Director Kim's disposable phone.

244
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:22,730
If you look at this, you can see that Kim Hyeon Wook was nearby when the bank manager died.

245
00:19:22,730 --> 00:19:25,360
I found the record that he made a call near K-Savings Bank.

246
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:30,240
Please summon Director Kim.

247
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,000
Yes, I will.

248
00:19:40,570 --> 00:19:43,190
Director, over here.

249
00:19:52,930 --> 00:19:54,130
I came from Feel Gallery.

250
00:19:54,130 --> 00:19:56,790
I'm Director Song. I received his call.

251
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:59,660
Here are the goods.

252
00:20:02,490 --> 00:20:04,620
Please follow me.

253
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:14,920
Director Song, is it over?

254
00:20:16,010 --> 00:20:18,720
It's faster than I thought.

255
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:22,100
To lose 200 billion won in gambling so fast...

256
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:24,990
Yes, I'll be right there.

257
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:28,070
Let's go.

258
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:21,490
Is all that cash?

259
00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:24,500
200 billion won sure is a lot of money.

260
00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:32,940
It's proof that you were nearby at the time of K-Savings Bank manager's death.

261
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:35,810
You had used a disposable phone.

262
00:21:35,810 --> 00:21:38,280
 Call log 

263
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:40,220
 Taepyeong-lo 2 ga, Jong-gu, Seoul 

264
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:42,750
We also have testimony from a witness who said he saw you.

265
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:47,570
With this, it would be hard to defend yourself pleading the 5th.

266
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:55,600
The apartment that Geum Tae Wong purchased for you went back into Geum Tae Woong's possession a long time ago.

267
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:59,310
As for your mother, she's just living there.

268
00:21:59,310 --> 00:22:05,650
It's a very detailed plot to hold your mother hostage pretending to buy you an apartment.

269
00:22:05,650 --> 00:22:10,710
Is he worth your silence?

270
00:22:10,710 --> 00:22:16,690
See clearly for yourself what kind of payback you received doing all his dirty work.

271
00:22:16,690 --> 00:22:22,100
Geum Tae Woong is living a good life continuing to abuse you and mock you.

272
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:25,050
Are you going to take all the blame yourself?

273
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:35,410
Geum Tae Woong will continue to create more and more people like you,

274
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:40,460
saying they're like sons to him.

275
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:04,630
I have crucial evidence.

276
00:23:05,710 --> 00:23:12,350
I'll tell you where that is. But I have a condition.

277
00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:21,450
My mother. Please take her somewhere safe. I'll tell you when I can confirm that.

278
00:23:21,450 --> 00:23:26,830
Don't worry about that. We'll keep her safe.

279
00:23:36,030 --> 00:23:36,930
Hello.

280
00:23:36,930 --> 00:23:40,200
Yes, Client. This is Gangwondo.

281
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:42,820
The goods have left the location.

282
00:23:44,210 --> 00:23:45,900
The goods left.

283
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:55,660
Yes?

284
00:23:56,800 --> 00:24:00,440
Geum Tae Woong laundered 200 billion won at a casino and put it on a truck.

285
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:03,640
We must get him at the scene.

286
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:07,730
Okay! Here is the warrant. Go catch him right away.

287
00:24:07,730 --> 00:24:11,310
You never know where he'd put that away or hide it somewhere.

288
00:24:11,310 --> 00:24:14,220
What are you doing? Run!

289
00:24:24,370 --> 00:24:27,410
So, did you find anything?

290
00:24:27,410 --> 00:24:33,930
We have circumstantial evidence, but we lack clear evidence that Prosecutors Oh Ha Ra and Baek Joon Soo were in on it.

291
00:24:35,610 --> 00:24:38,280
Yes, this is Hong Jae Man.

292
00:24:39,410 --> 00:24:42,750
There's no evidence yet. Yes.

293
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:45,960
I understand. I'll do that.

294
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:50,620
We don't need evidence. Let's go get Baek Joon Soo and Oh Ha Ra first.

295
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:53,890
I'm sure they'd confess if we beat them up.

296

â™«  Go, Don't stop, Don't look back  â™«

305
00:25:32,650 --> 00:25:33,860
What is it?

306
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:36,320
We're from the Inspection Headquarters at the Supreme Prosecutors' Office.

307
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:42,450
Prosecutors Baek Joon Soo and Oh Ha Ra, you're charged with the suspicion of being accomplices to Sa Do Chan's impersonation of a prosecutor.

308
00:25:42,450 --> 00:25:44,530
â™«  The lie which covers the truth  â™«

309
00:25:44,530 --> 00:25:47,870
Come with us to the Inspection Headquarters.

310
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:58,490
Yes.

311
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:02,490
What? Who?

312
00:26:02,490 --> 00:26:04,960
Inspection Headquarters?

313
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:07,860
That Deputy Hwang. That punk, really!

314
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:10,320
Can't you tell we're carrying out our duty now with a warrant?

315
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:12,980
Does inspection take priority over our investigation?

316
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:15,090
I guess you don't get it yet.

317
00:26:15,090 --> 00:26:21,260
If we reveal that you worked with a con artist, your investigation is annulled.

318
00:26:21,950 --> 00:26:23,920
Deputy Hwang!

319
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,660
What are you doing right now?

320
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:32,590
Deputy Prosecutor Yang, I'm carrying out my duty. Can't you tell?

321
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:38,570
Deputy Prosecutor Hwang, what's important right now? What?

322
00:26:38,570 --> 00:26:40,890
Can't you see that my guys are on their way out with a warrant?

323
00:26:40,890 --> 00:26:43,430
By chance, were you in on it, too?

324
00:26:43,430 --> 00:26:45,670
You punk, seriously!

325
00:26:48,590 --> 00:26:54,510
Fine. I'll take full responsibility. Let them go for now.

326
00:26:55,670 --> 00:26:57,960
Can't you hear me?

327
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:00,940
I said I'll take full responsibility.

328
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:05,490
What's slowing you down?

329
00:27:05,490 --> 00:27:07,150
Run!

330
00:27:16,550 --> 00:27:20,060
You. Take full responsibility.

331
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:24,470
Okay! I'll just quit.

332
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:55,620
- Please be careful in transport. 
 - Yes!

333
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:06,360
Where's Oppa Do Chan?

334
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:08,350
He left.

335
00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:11,350
That's good. He has to get him before he hides all that.

336
00:28:11,350 --> 00:28:14,950
Geum Tae Woong, we got you this time.

337
00:28:30,510 --> 00:28:33,720
We're almost at the Feel Gallery.

338
00:28:49,190 --> 00:28:51,630
What's going on here?

339
00:28:56,750 --> 00:29:02,490
CEO Geum Tae Woong. Where did you get all that?

340
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:04,370
What is it now?

341
00:29:04,370 --> 00:29:08,720
We brought a warrant to take a look at your money.

342
00:29:16,090 --> 00:29:18,900
What are you talking about?

343
00:30:09,130 --> 00:30:11,560
How did he know?

344
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:15,630
While I was in Gangwondo, I bought some cabbages from the mountains.

345
00:30:15,630 --> 00:30:19,930
What? Are you going to seize some cabbage?

346
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:28,170
Geum Tae Woong. How did he know?

347
00:30:29,330 --> 00:30:32,070
Here. Go ahead.

348
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:50,220


349
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:54,850
â™«  Crazy other world  â™«

350
00:30:54,850 --> 00:30:58,900
â™«  Crazy&nbsp;A choice like fate  â™«

351
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:03,900
â™«  Crazy the event which reverts back  â™«

352
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:06,160
 Switch 

353
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:09,450
 The bond that Geum Tae Woong hid. Make him bring it out himself. 

354
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:10,670
 How about a rich stone? 

355
00:31:10,670 --> 00:31:12,010
 Are you talking about the diamond? 

356
00:31:12,010 --> 00:31:14,810
 Nicknamed Whitestar. It was sold for 150 billion won at an auction. 

357
00:31:14,810 --> 00:31:15,860
It's a 60-carat diamond.

358
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:17,970
 You need a huge setting for a huge con. 

359
00:31:17,970 --> 00:31:19,900
 It's genuine diamond that came from the Sotherby's auction house. 

360
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:21,160
 Two-hundred billion won. I'll give you all of it. 

361
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:23,830
 It's CEO Geum Tae Woong's first day in court. 

362
00:31:23,830 --> 00:31:24,660
 Chief Prosecutor! 

363
00:31:24,660 --> 00:31:25,710
 Where are you going, Sa do Chan? 

364
00:31:25,710 --> 00:31:28,890
 I've done my job, so I'll be on my way.
