1
00:00:03,910 --> 00:00:06,810
 Six years ago 

2
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:10,140
 Get him. 

3
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:43,060
 Hey, open the door. Get out. 

4
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:46,400
 Get out, bastard! 

5
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,980
 Step aside. 

6
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:50,840
 Man Gyu. 

7
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:56,590
 Come out when I am nice to you. 

8
00:00:58,210 --> 00:01:00,560
 54th Examination Site for the Bar Exam #1  

9
00:01:04,270 --> 00:01:05,370
 Hi, Hyung. 

10
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:06,790
 - Do Chan.
 - Get out. 

11
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:08,930
 Please save me. 

12
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:10,920
 Hyung, what happened? 

13
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:13,970
 What should I do? Please save me, Do Chan. 

14
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:19,320
 Man Gyu... Do Chan. 

15
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,830
 What happened? 

16
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:28,220
 Hey. Do Chan! 

17
00:01:32,470 --> 00:01:34,440
 I won't beat you. 

18
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:35,950
 Open the door. 

19
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:41,380
 Hey, what are you? 

20
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:45,910
 Get him! 

21
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:53,390
 Hyung. It's me, Do Chan. Open the door. 

22
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:59,140
 Hyung. Are you okay? 

23
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:14,500
Whenever I remember the incident six years ago,

24
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,170
I feel so sorry toward you.

25
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:21,810
I am really sorry to you.

26
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:25,150
You could have become a real prosecutor.

27
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,310
But because of me...

28
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:32,440
Ah, Hyung. It's in the past.

29
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:34,290
I am so sorry.

30
00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:39,330
I can't face you.

31
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:44,530
Prosecutor... I had played as one.

32
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:47,040
But it was not my type of thing.

33
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:52,810
Thanks to you, we live in a more interesting way.

34
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:07,700


35
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,480
 The ultimate good thing is like water (because everything can benefit from it). 

36
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:27,280
Soso simsim. That's my motto of life.

37
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:31,970
It means, "look into all the small things in detail with your heart."

38
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:37,710
I'll become a very delicate Chief Prosecutor who listens to all the small and detailed requests you make in the future.

39
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:45,700
Chief Prosecutor, how about the deputy chief prosecutor.

40
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:50,700
I told the minister that he can take his time with his selection.

41
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:53,590
I see.

42
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:04,920
What do you think is going to happen to Former Chief Prosecutor Jeong?

43
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,710
Let him go no matter what it takes.

44
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:12,940
I don't know the details involved in doing so.

45
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:17,070
Find him innocent legally.

46
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:20,560
Make it happen.

47
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:29,430
Chief Prosecutor Jin, must you do this?

48
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:32,820
I left it to Baek Joon Soo, so rest assured.

49
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:39,320
Start taking pictures.

50
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,780
- One word please!
 - How do you feel?

51
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:43,670
Is it really true?

52
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:47,070
How do you feel right now?

53
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:49,590
Former Chief Prosecutor Jeong!

54
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:54,490
I'm not ashamed of anything under the sky.

55
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:59,550
For now, I'll be sure to cooperate with the prosecutors' office investigation.

56
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,490
Prosecutor Jeong! One word please!

57
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:05,300
One word please!

58
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:19,620
We'll take good care of you.

59
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:33,750
As long as we have firm evidence that says the purchaser bought them knowing that they were fake,

60
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:36,770
there won't be any charges of smuggling cultural heritage.

61
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:47,510
Sit down.

62
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,680
I'll get going.

63
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,600
Good job.

64
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:06,820
Don't end it too fast because there are reporters outside.

65
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,380
Shall we begin?

66
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,140
I'm his attorney, Park Joon Ho.

67
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:00,500
 Attorney Park Joon Ho 

68
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:09,160
In February of 2012, my client purchased ten Terracotta Warriors at 1 million won each.

69
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:12,000
This is a receipt that says he purchased everything for 10 million won total.

70
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,630
 The above person purchased ten Terracotta Warriors at the price of 10 million won total. 

71
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:20,520
If the Terracotta Warriors were real, they'd be worth millions of dollars.

72
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:25,160
The total price of 10 million is strong proof that they were fakes.

73
00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:38,850
The Cultural Heritage Administration sent over their analysis report.

74
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:45,980
 Analysis Report from the Cultural Heritage Administration 

75
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:49,280
It's the analysis result report that the Cultural Heritage Administration sent over.

76
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,170
I'll read it for you.

77
00:07:55,410 --> 00:07:57,330
 According to the various expert opinions, 

78
00:07:57,330 --> 00:08:03,110
we determined that it's an intricate fabrication of the artwork that was produced less than 10 years ago.

79
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:11,750
A fabrication...

80
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:20,700
This is too easy. I told you not to end this too fast.

81
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:23,470
- Let's go. 
 - Okay.

82
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:29,880
Jeong Do Yeong.

83
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:33,470
Jeong Do Yeong?

84
00:08:33,470 --> 00:08:37,520
Prosecutor Oh, how did you call me just now?

85
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:39,670
We're about to begin now.

86
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:45,600
Now, shall we begin the second round?

87
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:54,100
What is that Prosecutor Oh doing?

88
00:08:59,530 --> 00:09:01,500
Deputy Prosecutor Yang, hurry up and get over here!

89
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,780
Yes, ma'am.

90
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:17,260
Prosecutor Oh, do you think she'll do a good job?

91
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:21,820
Prosecutor Oh, she's quite extraordinary.

92
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:33,520
 6 years ago 

93
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:56,580
 You'll have to come over here quickly. 

94
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:16,490
 It was a mistake. For real. 

95
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:22,330
 He was threatening me. Help me. 

96
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:24,840
 I'll be forever indebted to you. 

97
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:29,450
 Of course, I should help you. 

98
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:34,570
 I have to help you in tough times, so that it goes a long way. 

99
00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:39,960
 We'll put him in a car and make it roll down (from the hill or something) and disguise it as a car accident. 

100
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:48,570
 Man Gyu! 

101
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,800
 Man Gyu... 

102
00:11:15,890 --> 00:11:17,680
 Catch him! 

103
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:25,760
What are you doing right now, Prosecutor Oh?

104
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:30,650
Jeong Do Yeong, from now on you're a suspect in

105
00:11:30,650 --> 00:11:32,700
Bong Man Gyu's murder six years ago.

106
00:11:34,530 --> 00:11:36,560
A murder?

107
00:11:37,690 --> 00:11:39,450
Murder?

108
00:11:40,690 --> 00:11:44,840
If you... if you just watch a little longer...

109
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:55,510
This receipt. You received this from Bong Man Gyu six years ago, right?

110
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:04,500
The receipt issued by Bong Man Gyu.

111
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:09,080
February 18, 2012, 11am. Died in a car accident.

112
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:14,960
This is the NFS Lab analysis report that analyzed the blood samples at the time.

113
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:17,120
And this is the result of the blood sample analysis

114
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:21,660
taken from the Terracotta Warrior we confiscated at your home.

115
00:12:32,770 --> 00:12:35,520
 Blood Sample Analysis Report 

116
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:38,530
According to the DNA analysis, both blood samples...

117
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:41,120
 Sample 1, Bong Man Gyu's blood sample and sample 2 from the Terracotta Warrior are 99.99% match. 

118
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:44,530
They're 99.99% match.

119
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:48,930
Why don't you explain yourself?

120
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:18,540
 Breaking news! Former Chief Prosecutor Jeong Do Yeong who was subpoenaed this morning for violation of of the Customs Law 

121
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:23,210
  confessed to the crime of murdering a smuggler Bong Man Gyu six years ago. 

122
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:27,220
 'Murder of smuggler Bong Man Gyu six years ago', Candidate Jeong Do Yeong confesses to crime 

123
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:30,900
Oh Ha Ra. Nice.

124
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:43,910
 Former Chief Prosecutor Jeong Do Yeong 

125
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:45,600
 was revealed to have murdered Mr. Bong 

126
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:49,950
  when the negotiation of the price didn't go as planned  during the smuggling process. 

127
00:13:49,950 --> 00:13:51,650
She's my daughter.

128
00:13:51,650 --> 00:13:55,010
 He tried to make it a perfect crime by disguising the murder as a car accident. 

129
00:13:55,010 --> 00:13:57,860
After betraying me.

130
00:13:57,860 --> 00:13:59,050
Shame on you.

131
00:13:59,050 --> 00:14:01,550
 The prosecutors' office is stunned by this news, and 

132
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:05,820
 they announced that they will conduct a thorough investigation to get to the bottom of this. 

133
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:09,640
 I'm Oh So Ra of SBC News. 

134
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:12,720
Former Chief Prosecutor Jeong Do Yeong has been placed under arrest without a warrant.

135
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:15,140
Who is the prosecutor who did this?

136
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:17,810
Prosecutor Oh Ha Ra.

137
00:14:17,810 --> 00:14:19,790
Oh Ha Ra?

138
00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:25,590
Oh Ha Ra, Sa Do Chan.

139
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:28,880
The two of them planned this from the get-go.

140
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,420
That's right.

141
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:37,400
Even if he may be a con artist who is faster than a ghost, I don't understand how he can be always one step ahead of us.

142
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:45,660
 What's that? 

143
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:46,990
Chinese chess pieces.

144
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:51,370
 Your chess pieces were so Chinese in style. It was difficult for me to play with them.  

145
00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:53,610
 Does a great calligrapher blame his skills on his brush? 

146
00:14:53,610 --> 00:14:57,200
 It's not like the chess rules change. 

147
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,390
 They say the devil is in the details. 

148
00:14:59,390 --> 00:15:02,130
 You never know what is going to make the difference. 

149
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:20,380
 The beauty of the game of chess is how we approach the king  step by step. 

150
00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:53,590
 They say the devil is in the details. You never know what would make the difference. 

151
00:16:10,090 --> 00:16:12,290
Let's go.

152
00:16:12,290 --> 00:16:14,120
All those were fake?

153
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:17,710
You're a murder suspect right now, and is that what you think is important?

154
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:38,090
Those were fake?

155
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:42,630
Then, who deceived me?

156
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:45,660
 Six years ago 

157
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:48,610
 There's this legend in China. 

158
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:54,200
 The one who's got the Terracotta Warriors becomes the king. 

159
00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:00,620
 I can bring you the real thing. 

160
00:17:13,830 --> 00:17:15,760
 Who are you? 

161
00:17:16,770 --> 00:17:20,130
 You know who CEO Geum Tae Woong of Feel Gallery is, right? 

162
00:17:20,130 --> 00:17:21,930
 CEO Geum? Why? 

163
00:17:21,930 --> 00:17:24,240
 Who are you? 

164
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:28,270
 I'm from the Incheon Prosecutors' Office. 
  Jeong Do Yeong  

165
00:17:31,770 --> 00:17:33,760
 You said you knew when you were heading over here. 

166
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:38,520
 I heard you're receiving something valuable from China next week? 

167
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:40,490
 Terracotta Warriors? 

168
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:44,900
 Make a direct deal with me. 

169
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:45,890
 A direct deal? 

170
00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:47,890
 Without going through Geum Tae Woong of Feel Gallery, 

171
00:17:47,890 --> 00:17:52,010
 if you and I make a deal, you can make more money off of it and I'll be happy because I'll buy it at a cheaper price. 

172
00:17:53,370 --> 00:17:54,820
 Don't want to? 

173
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:59,150
 If you don't want to, about the time you receive the valuables from China next week, 

174
00:17:59,150 --> 00:18:02,990
 customs will know somehow and will come after you. 

175
00:18:06,850 --> 00:18:13,390
 Don't send it to Geum Tae Woong. Next week, right here, 

176
00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:18,460
 let me buy them directly from you. Understand? 

177
00:18:23,390 --> 00:18:26,370
Geum Tae Woong deceived me.

178
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:30,180
That jerk deceived me.

179
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:33,060
He said they were real.

180
00:18:55,270 --> 00:18:59,190
Former Chief Prosecutor Jeong Do Yeong was placed under immediate arrest for murder.

181
00:18:59,190 --> 00:19:01,220
You know, right?

182
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:04,640
- Detective Kang. 
 - Yes, sir?

183
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:08,730
Those Terracotta Warriors. That was the scheme I came up with six years ago.

184
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:10,290
What?

185
00:19:10,290 --> 00:19:14,970
I intricately fabricated the Terracotta Warriors myself in China.

186
00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:21,130
And I ordered Bong Man Gyu to approach Geum Tae Woong.

187
00:19:21,130 --> 00:19:24,320
Saying that we could smuggle the real Terracotta Warriors.

188
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:27,660
Because Geum Tae Woong was already smuggling artworks,

189
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:31,180
as expected, he took the bait right away.

190
00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:37,760
If those fakes were sold to anyone in power, using that reason

191
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:40,840
I was going to get Geum Tae Woong.

192
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:44,580
But I guess Jeong Do Yeong ruined it for you in the middle.

193
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:46,340
Right.

194
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:48,330
That jerk

195
00:19:48,330 --> 00:19:54,420
became greedy using his position as a prosecutor, so my plan failed.

196
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:57,420
In the end, didn't he get his punishment?

197
00:19:57,420 --> 00:20:02,140
What are you talking about? Geum Tae Woong is alive and well.

198
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:08,970
I have to dig into his wrongdoings and reveal them to the world

199
00:20:08,970 --> 00:20:11,740
as long as I live.

200
00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:33,510
Man Gyu.

201
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:38,070
Because I'm such an idiot,

202
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:43,510
it took me six years.

203
00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:50,860
Release your resentment now.

204
00:20:54,450 --> 00:20:57,700
Rest in peace now.

205
00:21:27,370 --> 00:21:29,080
Betting.

206
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:34,570
Raise.

207
00:21:34,570 --> 00:21:36,110
Call.

208
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:52,350
All in.

209
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:02,780
Call.

210
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:06,360
Cards.

211
00:22:07,070 --> 00:22:09,000
Ace tight.

212
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,890
Poker.

213
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:28,590
Lend me some money. Hurry!

214
00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:29,980
I have no money.

215
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:33,420
The money I lent you in the car! Hurry, hurry!

216
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:35,190
Stop this now.

217
00:22:35,190 --> 00:22:38,040
Give it to me! Hurry!

218
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:45,890
Prosecutor Oh, you're a true prosecutor now.

219
00:22:45,890 --> 00:22:48,330
Thanks to you, Deputy Prosecutor.

220
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:52,180
Thanks, Prosecutor Oh.

221
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:53,860
You're welcome.

222
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:20,980
Good job. Thanks to you, Sa Do Chan.

223
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:24,850
This is all thanks to your amazing setting, Prosecutor Baek.

224
00:23:24,850 --> 00:23:27,600
 Setting: Slan that describs a preplanned situation that is set up for scamming 

225
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:32,730
Prosecutor Baek, you were really scary when you got angry last time.

226
00:23:32,730 --> 00:23:34,950
You act really well, too.

227
00:23:36,630 --> 00:23:40,020
Wait. Was it acting or not?

228
00:23:43,370 --> 00:23:48,660
When you first suggested such a bold plan to me, I was honestly surprised.

229
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:52,070
Would that be really possible?

230
00:23:52,770 --> 00:23:56,610
 I'm sure you heard, but they took my ID from me. 

231
00:23:56,610 --> 00:24:00,060
 I may not be able to go back to work tomorrow. 

232
00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:07,740
 I got to be a prosecutor somehow, but I feel bad that I ruined your position. 

233
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:11,860
 That's why I warned you. A wrong method is— 

234
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:14,410
 I'll put everything back myself. 

235
00:24:14,410 --> 00:24:18,560
 I can guess as to whom was behind all this. 

236
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:22,750
 Geum Tae Woong. It can only be him. 

237
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:29,090
 This trap must be his calculated move that fires me from my prosecutor position and slowly closes in on us. 

238
00:24:29,090 --> 00:24:34,530
 I didn't think you knew much since you were stuck in the room all the time. But you know more than I thought. 

239
00:24:34,530 --> 00:24:36,220
 There's no time. 

240
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:40,590
 If I get fired as a prosecutor, there's nothing we can do then. 

241
00:24:43,830 --> 00:24:44,920
 I'll meet Geum Tae Woong— 

242
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:48,700
 I'll meet him. Geum Tae Woong. 

243
00:25:04,350 --> 00:25:09,320
 I'll meet Geum Tae Woong and will sell you out. 

244
00:25:10,570 --> 00:25:15,630
 The way to deceive Geum Tae Woong. This is the only way. 

245
00:25:56,690 --> 00:25:59,470
Good job, Sa Do Chan.

246
00:25:59,470 --> 00:26:02,030
It was an amazing switch.

247
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:09,200
In the end, Jeong fell for the Faberge ad and took home the Terracotta Warriors.

248
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:13,210
The truth that was buried for six years has come to the surface.

249
00:26:13,210 --> 00:26:15,060
Thanks.

250
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:20,060
Thanks to you, Prosecutor Oh, Director Bong's long resentment has been relieved.

251
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:25,940
There's only one person left. Geum Tae Woong.

252
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:28,120
Brown Bear.

253
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:33,400
No. There's one more person.

254
00:26:34,490 --> 00:26:36,520
Sunbae Baek.

255
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:42,660
He's eager to get you. Be careful.

256
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:47,300
Sunbae Baek is the type of person who doesn't give up when he makes up his mind.

257
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:50,830
A mere Prosecutor Baek. I'm not afraid of him.

258
00:26:50,830 --> 00:26:54,120
Tell him to bring it on.

259
00:27:14,290 --> 00:27:15,550
Sunbae Baek.

260
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:20,620
Prosecutor Oh, you planned this knowing how dangerous this is?

261
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:23,010
How will you wrap it up?

262
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,910
How did you know about this place?

263
00:27:31,930 --> 00:27:34,900
There's something fishy about all this.

264
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,390
Baek Joon Soo, Sa Do Chan...

265
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:46,090
Did the two of them plan this to deceive me?

266
00:27:51,130 --> 00:27:53,860
These bastards.

267
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:10,280
I called Prosecutor Baek.

268
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:26,410
You scammers!

269
00:28:34,330 --> 00:28:41,320
