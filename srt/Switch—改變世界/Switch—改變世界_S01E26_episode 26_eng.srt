1
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:05,190


2
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:12,500
I finally got rid of the ghost from 20 years ago.

3
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:16,570
 20 years ago 
 Everything was all planned out from the beginning, huh? 

4
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:21,520
Meeting at the concert and rescuing me from the thugs.

5
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:24,990
You say when coincidences keep happening, it's meant to be?

6
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:29,120
You say you didn't know that I'm a daughter of an assemblyman?

7
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:33,510
You didn't need me, but my dad's power!

8
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:36,020
That's a misunderstanding. It's not like that.

9
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:38,680
What do you mean it's not?

10
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:41,890
You even have a woman

11
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:44,500
and a child you're hiding.

12
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:49,580
I'm done with you. I'll tell  Dad everything!

13
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:52,520
Mi Rae, listen to me.

14
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:55,530
I didn't know either. I just found out that I have a child!

15
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:58,500
Don't touch me, you fraud!

16
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:01,890
- What did you just say? 
 - Am I wrong?

17
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:05,840
Everything about you including the breaths you take was all a lie.

18
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,700
You're despicable, you scamming a**hole.

19
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:11,760
What? Scamming a**hole? Hey, hey, hey!

20
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,320
What did you just say? Say it again!

21
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:23,220
Mi Rae! Mi Rae!

22
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:32,760
Hi Hyungnim, I want to introduce you to a job.

23
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:38,360
How is it? Do you like it?

24
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:40,960
- Dad, did you pull another scam? 
 - Huh?

25
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,820
I quit doing that!

26
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:47,480
Starting today, I'm going to manage this vacation home and we're going to live here.  What do you think?

27
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:50,790
- Really? 
 - Of course.

28
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:53,700
Let's go.

29
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:25,660
You're early.

30
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:29,860
I wasn't ready to receive you, Hyungnim.

31
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:33,450
What exactly did you do?

32
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:38,840
You saw. Geez.

33
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:44,100
Now that it's come to this, let me ask you for a favor.

34
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:53,650
Please lend me your fingerprints.

35
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:05,510
 You a**hole... 

36
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:09,060
It can't be helped if you refuse a deal.

37
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:12,660
You killed my wife and

38
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:15,160
committed suicide.

39
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:18,140
Don't do this.

40
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:20,590
Brown Bear... please...

41
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:35,400
Hey!

42
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:47,970
You bastard. Die. Die. Die!

43
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,930
 CEO Geum who was attacked during the involvement in an unexpected fraud... 

44
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:29,860
Geum Tae Woong, you punk.

45
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:33,700
Even Sa Ma Cheon died.

46
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:37,740
He snuck out all by himself like a rat, huh?
 Victim Mr. Geum of "Feel Gallery attacks • natural gas fraud incident"... discharged from hospital today 

47
00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:45,150
I brought Jo Seong Do.

48
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:47,460
Tell him to come in.

49
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:55,490
Governor, it's my honor to meet you this way.

50
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:57,450
Sit down.

51
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:10,800
But, what is the reason you want to meet me?

52
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:13,520
You.

53
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:19,390
Do you know who your parents are?

54
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:26,930
My mother died and I don't know my father.

55
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:43,260
This is definitely me and my mom.

56
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:46,260
That person is your father.

57
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:50,370
He's your biological father.

58
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:01,390
No way, Governor.

59
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:04,630
Your joke is too much.

60
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:15,880
Is it really true?

61
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:18,480
Geum Tae Woong.

62
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:24,410
That scum of the earth. He left your sick mother and you.

63
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:27,660
He became my son-in-law,

64
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:31,900
deceiving me and my daughter!

65
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,120
No way.

66
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:44,420
You get it now? Then, go now and be good to your father.

67
00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:50,230
I'd never forgive a father like that, though.

68
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:19,790
That boy.

69
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:25,780
He's going to become Geum Tae Woong's time bomb.

70
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:35,980
 Who are you? 

71
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:37,960
 I'm her sunbae from her hometown. 

72
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:40,960
 I heard about her out of the blue. 

73
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:09,160
What are you going to do now?

74
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:12,690
- I'll have to cover it up. 
 - Cover it up?

75
00:08:12,690 --> 00:08:15,080
Are you going to pretend not to know?

76
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:16,650
Right.

77
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:20,640
I'll pretend I don't know.

78
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:23,090
Pretend to work hard for him.

79
00:08:23,090 --> 00:08:25,560
Pretend to be grateful.

80
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:30,560
Until I kill that bastard.

81
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:01,590
Sa Do Chan!

82
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:08,740
Sa Do Chan! Are you okay?

83
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:12,540
Why did you come all the way here? It's dangerous.

84
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:16,230
Geum Tae Woong... He's eagerly trying to catch you now.

85
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:21,230
I know. I was so shaken up that day that I was fooled by him.

86
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:30,860
Sa Do Chan.

87
00:09:33,770 --> 00:09:36,240
Who's Sa Do Chan?

88
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,790
Who are you? Why did you run away?

89
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:42,420
You came running after me. That's why I ran away.

90
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:45,620
I ate not too long ago.

91
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:50,760
Now that it's come to this, I'll have to become a real attempted murderer.

92
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:56,100
No way. Never. I'll make sure to catch Geum Tae Woong. I'll clear your name, too.

93
00:09:56,570 --> 00:10:00,070
- No matter what happens, you have to abide by the law. 
 - Prosecutor Oh.

94
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:02,530
I decide the rules of this game.

95
00:10:02,530 --> 00:10:05,720
The law to me is to punish that bastard, Geum Tae Woong.

96
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:08,230
- I know how you feel now, but—
 - By chance,

97
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:11,260
do you remember what I told you last time?

98
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:15,350
I said try not to get to know me too much.

99
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:21,390
Was it the villa?

100
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:28,670
Oppa Do Chan, do you think he's going around eating his meals?

101
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:31,900
You know Do Chan. I'm sure he's fine.

102
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:37,190
- The entire country is out to catch Do Chan. There's no way he's been caught already, right?

103
00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:38,820
Hey! Don't even say that.

104
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:40,850
Get caught? Who do you mean?

105
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:42,150
Oppa!

106
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:43,530
Do Chan!

107
00:10:43,530 --> 00:10:46,840
Why didn't you call us? Do you know how worried I was?

108
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:49,020
Sit, sit. I'm glad you're fine.

109
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:50,770
You're okay, right?

110
00:10:50,770 --> 00:10:54,240
What's with your mood, everyone? Why so down?

111
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:57,900
You must be struggling so much (with your loss). We were so worried.

112
00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:00,350
Why worry?

113
00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:02,720
You heard, right? Geum Tae Woong is still alive.

114
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,140
Because he was called Brown Bear, I thought he was like a (dull) bear.

115
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:08,160
He's a (clever) fox. He even deceived you.

116
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,450
What are you going to do?

117
00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:13,090
What else? I'll pay him back the as much as he hurt me.

118
00:11:13,090 --> 00:11:15,500
Are we going to set him up?

119
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:19,870
Now, our genius hacker. Should we take a look at what you can do?

120
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:28,910
 Prosecutor Baek Joon Soo 

121
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:14,530
Prosecutor Baek, are you all right?

122
00:12:14,530 --> 00:12:17,580
You don't look too good.

123
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:20,640
Hey, is it possible  just because I complimented that Sa Do Chan,

124
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:23,890
you're not upset inside, stressing out, are you?

125
00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:30,420
Deputy Prosecutor, Sa Do Chan has to die if we have to get Geum Tae Woong legally.

126
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:32,240
What are you saying now?

127
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:35,380
Why must he die?

128
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:38,960
When I heard his story, aigoo...

129
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:42,950
Joon Soo, you must be thinking all kinds of things because you're not feeling well.

130
00:12:42,950 --> 00:12:47,710
Brown Bear. Sa Do Chan is an obstacle for catching Geum Tae Woong.

131
00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:52,640
Me, Prosecutor Oh, and you, too... We were also accomplices at one point.

132
00:12:54,550 --> 00:13:00,860
So, Sa Do Chan has to disappear and Prosecutor Baek alone must remain.

133
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:06,010
And when that happens, please lead the investigation properly, Deputy Prosecutor.

134
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:18,210
 Spooky? 

135
00:13:18,210 --> 00:13:20,390
Hey, Jack, long time no see.

136
00:13:20,390 --> 00:13:23,700
 Man, I haven't heard from you in ages. 

137
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:28,060
 When you fell off the grid, I just assumed the FBI had caught you or something. 

138
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:31,320
I've been busy with business.

139
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:38,740
Do you still have that program you used to hack into the FSB server?

140
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:41,620
If so, can you give it to me?

141
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:43,760
 That program. 

142
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:46,600
 It's hard to come by and it's super expensive. 

143
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:50,220
 But because it's you, sure, why not. 

144
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:52,010
 I'm sending it now. 

145
00:13:52,010 --> 00:13:53,800
Thanks.

If everything goes according to our plan, can you really steal it?

148
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:05,190
Of course. You can say that's all up to our In Tae.

149
00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:07,980
What do you take me for? Just trust me.

150
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:09,260
Do you trust him?

151
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:11,050
- Yes, I believe in you! 
 - I believe!

152
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:12,970
We believe!

153
00:14:12,970 --> 00:14:16,130
If you knock, it will be open for you.

 920,000 Swiss Francs have been withdrawn. (Worth $920,000 US) 

156
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:38,370
920,000 franc... 1 billion won?

157
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:46,150
 Your money has been withdrawn.

 Your money has been withdrawn.

What's this?

00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,760
Director Kim!

- The money is coming out of my secret account. 
 - What?

162
00:14:57,520 --> 00:15:00,750
- Find out what's going on right away. 
 - Okay.

163
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:06,900
 Download 

164
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:08,520
 Done 

165
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:15,220
How much is it? One, ten, hundred, thousand, ten thousand...

166
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:17,120
Good job! Good job!

167
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:19,660
You did good!

168
00:15:21,530 --> 00:15:24,010
A Korean hacker is attacking them.

169
00:15:24,010 --> 00:15:26,660
A Korean hacker?

170
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:29,550
They must be able to trace them to find out where doing this!

171
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:30,820
They're tracing the IP.

172
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:32,820
Go and get him right away! Now!

173
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:34,880
All right.

174
00:15:57,290 --> 00:16:00,900
 Governor Choi Jeong Pil 

175
00:16:03,490 --> 00:16:04,720
It's me.

176
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:08,800
What's this about? I believe there's no need for me to be talking to you.

177
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,680
Two-hundred billion won.

178
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:12,400
How did you know...

179
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:17,200
That was my money originally. I'll be putting it to good use.

180
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:21,550
You're going overboard. Think of your age.

181
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:24,240
Do you want to get that money back?

182
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,640
 Then, bring that ledger to me. 

183
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:29,820
Bring it to that location in an hour.

184
00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:37,930
This old man!

185
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:09,040
Old man, I'll have to finish you off.

186
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,840
I think it's over there.

187
00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:06,150
 There's nothing here. 

188
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:08,920
 What's this? 

189
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:10,020
Bees!

190
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:13,370
 Run fast! 

191
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:28,720
Too bad. It would've been daebak if we stole it away.

192
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:31,890
We can live without ever worrying about money.

193
00:18:31,890 --> 00:18:34,360
This is where our plan ends.

194
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:36,600
I know.

195
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:39,970
Our genius hacker. You did well.

196
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:47,230
Prosecutor, we're ready to dispatch.

197
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:48,530
Great. Let's go.

198
00:18:48,530 --> 00:18:50,300
But where are we going?

199
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:52,600
I'll tell you on our way.

200
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:07,930
Governor.

201
00:19:10,290 --> 00:19:13,350
I'm here. Geum Tae Woong.

202
00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:33,760
Sa Do Chan.

203
00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:45,220
I did as you told me to.

204
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,800
Thank you, Governor.

205
00:19:55,030 --> 00:19:57,820
My 200 billion won. You were behind this.

206
00:19:57,820 --> 00:19:59,790
How about the ledger?

207
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:15,230
You thought I'd fall for such a trick?

208
00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:20,360
Did you think that account over there would be hacked by such child's play?

209
00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:29,450
I came here to send the old man off to the world beyond, but you get to go unexpectedly.

210
00:20:29,450 --> 00:20:31,130
To your father's side.

211
00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:35,990
Right. Since we started here,

212
00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:38,310
let's finish here, Brown Bear.

213
00:20:39,090 --> 00:20:40,170
Start?

214
00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:42,500
Twenty years ago,

215
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:50,700
you tried to put the blame for killing your wife on my father.

216
00:20:52,650 --> 00:20:55,290
How did you know that?

217
00:20:55,290 --> 00:21:00,750
Because I was there when it happened.

218
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:03,950
 Die. Die! 

219
00:21:10,610 --> 00:21:15,660
So you're saying you were up there.

220
00:21:17,050 --> 00:21:20,070
I lost my father twice.

221
00:21:21,330 --> 00:21:24,340
To the same guy.

222
00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:33,010
Thanks for being alive and well. Let's see the end of it today.

223
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:40,340
Don't make a mistake, Sa Do Chan.

224
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:46,970
Because I didn't come to pretend to be dead this time. I came to kill you.

225
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:06,650
You!

226
00:22:06,650 --> 00:22:09,430
Murderer!

227
00:22:09,430 --> 00:22:13,000
I'll prove your sins no matter what it takes.

228
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,100
I can't forgive you!

229
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:21,360
If you can kill me, kill me. You probably can't kill me.

230
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:23,810
Your father was dumb too.

231
00:22:23,810 --> 00:22:29,500
If he wanted to get revenge, he shouldn't have scammed me. He should have killed me.

232
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:36,210
You resemble your father. You can't kill a person.

233
00:22:36,210 --> 00:22:40,710
Why?! Because you're a dumb scammer.

234
00:22:42,610 --> 00:22:47,370
You judged me wrong. I'm different than my father.

235
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:54,560
Sa Do Chan... spare my life.

236
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:59,820
Why? Why don't you act like you're not scared, huh?

237
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:05,790
Please... please...

238
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:09,120
Sa Do Chan, stop it!

239
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,730
Don't let him go. He's the guy that killed my father.

240
00:23:11,730 --> 00:23:14,660
He's the guy who killed my father!

241
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:16,370
No!

242
00:23:36,050 --> 00:23:38,160
Arrest him.

243
00:23:48,810 --> 00:23:53,220
Scammer Sa Do Chan who was on the run for the attempted murder of Feel Gallery Geum Tae Woong

244
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:58,030
has been arrested by Oh Ha Ra's team from Seoul Central Prosecutor's Office.

245
00:23:58,030 --> 00:24:03,290
While Sa Do Chan was assaulting Chairman Geum again he was arrested at the scene.

246
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:23,570
Why did you pretend to be a prosecutor? Were you really thinking of killing CEO Geum?

247
00:24:23,570 --> 00:24:25,420
Did you really plan to kill him?

248
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:26,590
Was there a reason for this?

249
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:28,710
Was there a personal motive?

250
00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:29,920
Please tell us.

251
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:32,040
Were you thinking of killing him?

252
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:34,020
- Please tell us! 
 - Please tell us!

253
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:36,880
What was the reason?

254
00:24:46,030 --> 00:24:49,060
 Was that a penthouse? 

255
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:52,220
 I'm going to call him there and kill him. 

256
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:53,720
 You can't become a murderer. 

257
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:58,120
 There... you come and arrest me. 

258
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:03,240
 Crime scene. You know it right? I'm getting arrested because I will be trying to kill Geum Tae Woong. 

259
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:08,270
 During the interrogation, I will testify that you, Prosecutor Baek and Deputy Prosecutor Yang have nothing to do with me pretending to be a prosecutor.  

260
00:25:08,270 --> 00:25:09,460
 That's how I'm going to testify. 

261
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:12,300
 Perhaps, to protect us? 

262
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:17,120
 You and Prosecutor Baek have to stay in the prosecutors' office to catch CEO Geum. 

263
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:23,130
 And then indict me with severe punishment so that people will believe that you didn't plot with me. 

264
00:25:23,130 --> 00:25:26,690
 What are you thinking? You'll be in jail for at least 10 years. 

265
00:25:26,690 --> 00:25:30,080
 I have an idea about that too. So don't worry. 

266
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:33,380
 You just match the timing and come to the penthouse. 

267
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,940
 Beware, Prosecutor Oh. Even if you're a little late, 

268
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:43,980
 I will truly kill Geum Tae Woong. 

269
00:26:01,950 --> 00:26:06,450
- True Name? 
- Baek Joon Soo

270
00:26:07,450 --> 00:26:08,320
Occupation?

271
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:13,180
Prosecutor. Seoul Central Prosecutor's Office Crime Division 6.

272
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:15,600
Are you joking right now?

273
00:26:16,310 --> 00:26:20,270
I will ask you again. Name?

274
00:26:20,270 --> 00:26:21,830
So annoying.

275
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:25,330
Sa Do Chan.

276
00:26:25,330 --> 00:26:26,780
 Sa Do Chan. 

277
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:28,600
Occupation?

278
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:34,450
A scammer who impersonated a prosecutor.

279
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:37,720
 Scammer. 

280
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:43,800
Sa Do Chan, did you ever impersonate a prosecutor?

281
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:50,980
Not one person noticed that I was posing as a prosecutor.

282
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:55,890
Are you saying no one in the prosecutor's office conspired with you?

283
00:26:56,670 --> 00:26:59,380
This is why prosecutors are the problem.

284
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:03,700
They think they're the smartest people in the world because they are good at Korean, English and math.

285
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:05,960
They were all fooled.

286
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:11,510
 No co-conspirators. 

287
00:27:17,550 --> 00:27:22,190
Did you ever approach Feel Gallery CEO Geum with the intention of harming him?

288
00:27:24,130 --> 00:27:28,540
Mr. Prosecutor. Let's not lead this into a homicide. That sounds too horrible.

289
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:33,790
It was just a fist fight between two men. Let's just wrap it up as an assault case.

290
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:37,890
It'd be even nicer if I got to meet with Geum Tae Woong and settle this with a fine.

291
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:38,940
 Answer: No, I want a settlement. 

292
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:44,060
Impersonating a public official is subject to prison time up to three years and assault is subject to prison time up to seven years.

293
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:48,860
But this is my conviction and my motivation of crime can be extenuated and I can confess during the trial to beg for a pardon.

294
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:51,890
Well, if I look a little regretful in front of the judge then

295
00:27:51,890 --> 00:27:55,880
I think I'll be sentenced to maybe 2 years?

296
00:27:57,390 --> 00:28:01,860
Sa Do Chan. Is this who you are?

297
00:28:02,950 --> 00:28:06,990
A guy with a cold heart like you won't understand.

298
00:28:06,990 --> 00:28:09,420
Cold heart?

299
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:20,960
Could you leave us for a moment?

300
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,720
Yes.

301
00:28:27,710 --> 00:28:30,050
I'm pausing the recording for a moment.

302
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:35,370
What's he doing?

303
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:43,820
Deputy Prosecutor Yang.

304
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:44,910
Yes, Chief Prosecutor.

305
00:28:44,910 --> 00:28:48,160
What is Prosecutor Baek doing right now? What is going on?

306
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:50,220
Whatever happens, don't you know he can't assault him?

307
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:53,320
Yes, I will go in and check.

308
00:28:58,750 --> 00:29:01,850
Baek Joon Soo, what's going on?

309
00:29:01,850 --> 00:29:03,650
Open the door.

310
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:11,200
Sa Do Chan, I heard from Prosecutor Oh Ha Ra.

311
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:16,750
In order to protect us, I heard you staged this murder attempt and got arrested on purpose.

312
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:22,700
I really wanted to hit him a couple more times but Prosecutor Oh came faster than I thought she would.

313
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:25,930
You irritate me, Sa Do Chan.

314
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:33,630
If only one, Baek Joon Soo or Sa Do Chan could live, Baek Joon Soo has to live.

315
00:29:36,630 --> 00:29:41,320
So I will kill you, Sa Do Chan.

316
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:48,520
Why are those two men so serious?

317
00:29:56,190 --> 00:30:03,230


318
00:30:03,230 --> 00:30:06,260
 Crazy, different world. 

319
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:10,330
 Crazy, a decision like a fate 

320
00:30:10,330 --> 00:30:15,390
♫  It became natural to approve it  ♫

321
00:30:15,390 --> 00:30:18,270
♫  Crazy, never ending  ♫

322
00:30:18,270 --> 00:30:20,650
♫ Crazy  ♫

323
00:30:20,650 --> 00:30:22,340
♫  The penetrating gaze.  ♫

324
00:30:22,340 --> 00:30:23,810
  Arrest Sa Do Chan. 

325
00:30:23,810 --> 00:30:25,470
 Aren't Prosecutor Baek and Prosecutor Oh a little too much? 

326
00:30:25,470 --> 00:30:27,360
 Why are they ignoring him after using him so much? 

327
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:29,430
 There is 2 billion won under your name. 

328
00:30:29,430 --> 00:30:31,120
 T-Two- billion won somewhere? 

329
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,790
 That's Geum Tae Woong's hidden son. 

330
00:30:32,790 --> 00:30:35,650
 He's really bothering me. Get rid of him quietly. 

331
00:30:35,650 --> 00:30:38,150
 I will die as Scammer Sa Do Chan. 

332
00:30:38,150 --> 00:30:39,710
 Please live as Prosecutor Baek. 

333
00:30:39,710 --> 00:30:41,340
 Why do I have to live as someone else? 

334
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:42,590
 Do Chan collapsed? 

335
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:45,230
 Did he do that to kill Do Chan?! 

336
00:30:45,230 --> 00:30:47,270
 Sa Do Chan has escaped  while he was transferred to a hospital. 

337
00:30:47,270 --> 00:30:48,060
 Sa Do Chan? 

338
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:51,920
 This is a good chance to get rid of him. If you lose him again 

339
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:53,020
 I can't forgive you. 

340
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:54,590
♫  Was it changed?  ♫

341
00:30:54,590 --> 00:30:57,400
 Remember that time.
