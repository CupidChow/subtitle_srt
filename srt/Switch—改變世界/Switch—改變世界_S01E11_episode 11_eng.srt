1
00:00:48,921 --> 00:00:56,931
 Timing and

2
00:01:05,081 --> 00:01:08,751
There wasn't anything unusual in Choi Sang Hyeon's belongings.

3
00:01:15,721 --> 00:01:17,141
Thai bible.

4
00:01:17,141 --> 00:01:21,311
Choi Sang Hyeon had worked in the Thai Embassy.

5
00:01:21,311 --> 00:01:22,801
Really?

6
00:02:00,221 --> 00:02:03,671
 Do you think Sa Do Chan 

7
00:02:03,671 --> 00:02:06,171
 played the role of my avatar without any intent for his own personal gain? 

8
00:02:09,351 --> 00:02:12,041
On the road I walk on

9
00:02:14,711 --> 00:02:17,731
I sent lions.

10
00:02:21,881 --> 00:02:24,991
I will save you.

11
00:02:28,361 --> 00:02:33,151
On the road that I walk on, I sent lions.

12
00:02:33,151 --> 00:02:36,661
I will save you.

13
00:02:55,451 --> 00:02:57,811
 Switch 

14
00:02:57,811 --> 00:03:01,901
 06
 The eyes focus on what one is curious about. 

15
00:03:09,321 --> 00:03:15,361
Sunbae! We finally found him... Brown Bear.

16
00:03:30,991 --> 00:03:33,821
Now that our job is finished,

17
00:03:33,821 --> 00:03:35,901
we're almost done with the big con (grand fraud scheme), right?

18
00:03:35,901 --> 00:03:38,491
Well, I guess we can say we're almost there.

19
00:03:38,491 --> 00:03:41,221
Avoid asking me those excessive questions.

20
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:42,821
So, what's our next mission?

21
00:03:42,821 --> 00:03:45,201
You have to ask Do Chan that.

22
00:03:45,201 --> 00:03:48,001
But maybe because it's supreme pizza,

23
00:03:48,001 --> 00:03:50,391
there are a lot of shrimp and it's delicious!

24
00:03:50,391 --> 00:03:54,171
Not "supreme," but "shrimp." ( in Englisn ) Shrimp ( In Korean )

25
00:03:54,171 --> 00:03:56,021
Oh, really?

26
00:03:56,021 --> 00:03:58,131
So embarrassing.

27
00:03:59,951 --> 00:04:05,231
Excuse me, supr... shri... You got me confused now.

28
00:04:05,231 --> 00:04:07,671
One more pie like the one that we are eating!

29
00:04:07,671 --> 00:04:11,991
Help the defendant escape illegally. Does that make sense?

30
00:04:11,991 --> 00:04:13,931
We had no other choice.

31
00:04:13,931 --> 00:04:17,141
You should've stopped him. You should've opposed him!

32
00:04:18,771 --> 00:04:21,591
If you keep cheating like that, you'll end up getting attacked by the enemy.

33
00:04:21,591 --> 00:04:25,721
Both of us will eventually lose our opportunity to stand inside the ring.

34
00:04:25,721 --> 00:04:28,071
Both of us?

35
00:04:28,071 --> 00:04:31,491
Don't you always lose because you are always thinking of fighting inside the ring?

36
00:04:31,491 --> 00:04:34,401
Those people are throwing chairs from outside of the ring and doing whatever they want.

37
00:04:34,401 --> 00:04:40,531
Sa Do Chan, do you know why those people became like that?

38
00:04:41,251 --> 00:04:45,171
Because that's the simple method. Because they want to get things they desire the easy way.

39
00:04:45,171 --> 00:04:48,161
Because they want to easily get rid of the things that get in their way.

40
00:04:48,161 --> 00:04:51,061
They became like that after always going the easy way.

41
00:04:51,061 --> 00:04:55,221
Yes, yes, yes. You keep doing the right way, Mr. Ethics Teacher.

42
00:04:55,221 --> 00:04:59,491
If I can't do through both roads, I'll go through the simple route.

43
00:05:00,561 --> 00:05:04,871
Can you even catch Brown Bear before you die like that?

44
00:05:10,841 --> 00:05:12,731
Both of you, stop it.

45
00:05:33,971 --> 00:05:36,421
 You might not have a position to come back to, Sunbae. 

46
00:05:36,421 --> 00:05:41,521
So, quickly get up.

47
00:05:45,891 --> 00:05:48,891
  Brown Bear - in charge 

48
00:06:11,791 --> 00:06:16,051
  Exactly who... exactly who was it? 

49
00:06:25,251 --> 00:06:27,291
 Who did that to me...? 

50
00:06:38,251 --> 00:06:42,341
What's the matter? You even drink with an embarrassing sister like me.

51
00:06:42,341 --> 00:06:45,261
It's because I'm frustrated. Because I'm frustrated.

52
00:06:45,261 --> 00:06:47,751
About what?

53
00:06:47,751 --> 00:06:51,191
One side is too strong.

54
00:06:51,191 --> 00:06:55,231
And one side is too bland.

55
00:06:56,351 --> 00:06:58,421
The ratio is so wrong.

56
00:06:58,421 --> 00:07:02,261
The ratio? Should I make it again?

57
00:07:13,311 --> 00:07:17,681
Can't you just mix people together?

58
00:07:24,571 --> 00:07:29,751
Hey! Baek Joon Soo, Sa Do Chan, you all come out!

59
00:07:29,751 --> 00:07:32,921
Aish, you aren't going to come out?

60
00:07:32,921 --> 00:07:35,961
If you don't come out, I'm coming inside!

61
00:07:35,961 --> 00:07:38,061
Hey, Baek Joon Soo!

62
00:07:40,361 --> 00:07:42,381
I'm glad you're here.

63
00:07:43,301 --> 00:07:44,871
Why are you like that?

64
00:07:44,871 --> 00:07:48,391
Are you Gangnam Road during a traffic jam?

65
00:07:48,391 --> 00:07:50,601
So backed up.

66
00:07:50,601 --> 00:07:54,161
Ha Ra, how much alcohol did you...?

67
00:07:56,801 --> 00:08:00,701
Are you some kind of ethics teacher?

68
00:08:00,701 --> 00:08:03,201
You think you're all good just for saying the right things?

69
00:08:03,921 --> 00:08:09,001
Why are you like this? I also scored really well on my ethics tests during the SAT.

70
00:08:12,181 --> 00:08:16,301
Everyone else is living a compromising life.

71
00:08:16,301 --> 00:08:19,231
Baek Joon Soo, just you!

72
00:08:19,231 --> 00:08:23,761
What's the use of living by a textbook by yourself?

73
00:08:23,761 --> 00:08:26,911
You are drunk. Go home and sleep.

74
00:08:26,911 --> 00:08:31,401
Because you two aren't mixing together, that's why I'm drinking a mixed drink.

75
00:08:33,151 --> 00:08:36,771
To tell you the truth,

76
00:08:39,371 --> 00:08:44,061
I don't mind going a little unethical.

77
00:08:45,991 --> 00:08:49,451
Because I drank it mixed, I'm so drunk.

78
00:08:52,471 --> 00:08:56,401
Don't take to heart what I said.

79
00:08:56,401 --> 00:08:59,861
You punk... so handsome.

80
00:09:20,311 --> 00:09:22,971
I have something to tell you in private.

81
00:09:26,291 --> 00:09:29,111
I got this photo from the jail.

82
00:09:29,111 --> 00:09:32,371
This person delivered the bible to Choi Sang Hyeon.

83
00:09:32,371 --> 00:09:34,401
Do you know who this is?

84
00:09:34,401 --> 00:09:37,341
I haven't verified it yet.

85
00:09:37,341 --> 00:09:40,701
What happened to Choi Sang Hyeon? Nothing else happened to him after that incident?

86
00:09:40,701 --> 00:09:44,381
Yes. I think it's going to end as a car accident happening.

87
00:09:44,381 --> 00:09:47,561
I think they haven't discovered any specifically weird things.

88
00:09:50,981 --> 00:09:55,141
 The charm of playing Janggi is slowly closing in on the king. 

89
00:09:56,001 --> 00:09:58,181
 Since you like to play your knight... 

90
00:09:58,181 --> 00:10:00,771
 I realized I had to get to your knights first. 

91
00:10:01,581 --> 00:10:03,471
Investigate Prosecutor Baek's surroundings.

92
00:10:03,471 --> 00:10:05,711
Prosecutor Baek's surroundings?

93
00:10:08,141 --> 00:10:09,851
Yes, I understand.

94
00:10:16,991 --> 00:10:19,501
You know Mr. Hwang?

95
00:10:19,501 --> 00:10:23,931
I looked into his certified copy of the corporate registration, property taxes, and income taxes.

96
00:10:23,931 --> 00:10:26,801
He's clean. He's a very clean-cut businessman.

97
00:10:26,801 --> 00:10:30,841
That's because it was managed under a false title. So, I'm sure it looks good on the outside.

98
00:10:30,841 --> 00:10:33,371
The problem is his villa.

99
00:10:33,371 --> 00:10:36,301
- Villa? 
- Right now, President Hwang.

100
00:10:37,601 --> 00:10:39,611
Is he the real Brown Bear?

101
00:10:41,971 --> 00:10:44,961
Hey, we went through a lot to find that out. What are you saying now?

102
00:10:44,961 --> 00:10:48,391
Then, are you saying that real Brown Bear is another person?

103
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:53,601
Whether the person that I saw at the villa is really the Brown Bear, I need to verify that

104
00:10:53,601 --> 00:10:56,061
so that I can solve the last puzzle.

105
00:10:59,541 --> 00:11:02,991
I was so young that I don't remember well.

106
00:11:02,991 --> 00:11:05,631
There was a second floor made of wood,

107
00:11:05,631 --> 00:11:07,621
and there were several buildings surrounding it.

108
00:11:08,271 --> 00:11:12,371
Come down the hill in S-shape like this, then you see an entrance.

109
00:11:13,721 --> 00:11:15,831
I love it.

110
00:11:16,831 --> 00:11:18,791
There is even a swimming pool.

111
00:11:23,221 --> 00:11:26,721
Right. The swimming pool.

112
00:11:28,121 --> 00:11:30,791
There was a swimming pool here.

113
00:11:30,791 --> 00:11:35,361
Then, if this villa belongs to Hwang Beom Do...

114
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:40,181
Then, you're saying you're sure he's Brown Bear, right?

115
00:11:42,791 --> 00:11:46,801
The kids are following him, so I'm sure we'll get something.

116
00:11:50,501 --> 00:11:56,871
 Dongyeong Mills 

117
00:12:00,291 --> 00:12:01,881
Let's follow them.

118
00:12:02,511 --> 00:12:07,521
- Oh, yes. 
 - Yes, things turned out really well this time.

119
00:12:13,801 --> 00:12:16,201
You've worked hard.

120
00:12:17,531 --> 00:12:18,651
We're doing well thanks to you.

121
00:12:18,651 --> 00:12:20,971
Things are going so well this time.

122
00:12:20,971 --> 00:12:22,501
What do you think?

123
00:12:22,501 --> 00:12:25,201
There doesn't seem anything special going on.

124
00:12:32,071 --> 00:12:33,521
What the heck...

125
00:12:41,891 --> 00:12:43,051
What is this place?

126
00:12:43,051 --> 00:12:46,001
What's going on in there that they're securing this place so well?

127
00:12:46,001 --> 00:12:47,801
It's suspicious.

128
00:12:47,801 --> 00:12:51,541
I know. All the way in Gangreung.

129
00:12:51,541 --> 00:12:54,371
Oh, they are coming.

130
00:12:54,371 --> 00:12:56,681
How can we just go? We look suspicious then.

131
00:12:56,681 --> 00:12:58,971
What do you want me to do?

132
00:13:14,071 --> 00:13:18,111
Hey! How dare you fool around here? So speechless.

133
00:13:18,111 --> 00:13:20,741
Move the car!

134
00:13:20,741 --> 00:13:23,361
I'm sorry.

135
00:13:26,551 --> 00:13:28,611
I'm sorry.

136
00:13:54,671 --> 00:13:55,791
 In Tae 

137
00:14:02,261 --> 00:14:04,801
Oh, Hyung, can you talk?

138
00:14:04,801 --> 00:14:11,161
Ah, Team Leader Kim Tae Sik, I don't need insurance.

139
00:14:11,161 --> 00:14:16,061
Ah, customer. We have a product that's perfect for you, customer.

140
00:14:30,791 --> 00:14:33,741
Where are you going during work hours, Sunbae?

141
00:14:35,381 --> 00:14:40,661
My body aches from working so hard. I'm going to go to a  sauna.

142
00:14:41,391 --> 00:14:43,161
See you later.

143
00:14:46,621 --> 00:14:48,771
 Ttorae Orae Chicken 

144
00:14:51,781 --> 00:14:56,031
The most important thing is the chicken.

145
00:14:56,031 --> 00:15:01,601
Chickens that were raised in the happiest surroundings are the freshest ones.

146
00:15:01,601 --> 00:15:03,311
And?

147
00:15:03,311 --> 00:15:06,941
The most important thing is oil.

148
00:15:06,941 --> 00:15:12,031
You must use pure vegetable oil. Write this down.

149
00:15:12,031 --> 00:15:15,811
Oil. Pure vegetable oil.

150
00:15:18,711 --> 00:15:24,251
Well-fried chicken skin has a crispy texture.

151
00:15:26,341 --> 00:15:29,811
Ah, yes. That's really true.

152
00:15:31,111 --> 00:15:37,201
Madame Audrey, I think you have passion that is hotter than this oil.

153
00:15:37,201 --> 00:15:40,281
But seriously, what is the most important thing for real?

154
00:15:40,281 --> 00:15:43,981
Chicken, oil, and time. You say they're all so important.

155
00:15:43,981 --> 00:15:46,501
I'm confused as the newbie chef.

156
00:15:47,641 --> 00:15:51,731
Well, they're all important.

157
00:15:51,731 --> 00:15:54,581
I think one thing is missing though.

158
00:15:54,581 --> 00:15:55,771
What could that be?

159
00:15:55,771 --> 00:16:00,211
Popcorn. You have to eat this fried chicken with popcorn,

160
00:16:00,211 --> 00:16:02,531
so that you can really taste the true flavor.

161
00:16:02,531 --> 00:16:05,371
I thought you wanted to learn how to make fried chicken.

162
00:16:05,371 --> 00:16:08,241
It looks like you're marketing your popcorn.

163
00:16:08,241 --> 00:16:10,621
Our current society where everything changes so fast,

164
00:16:10,621 --> 00:16:14,131
without uniqueness to your product, could you survive?

165
00:16:14,131 --> 00:16:17,911
Now, let's form a business alliance.

166
00:16:17,911 --> 00:16:19,591
Business alliance...

167
00:16:19,591 --> 00:16:21,821
Here, here.

168
00:16:21,821 --> 00:16:24,891
There.

169
00:16:25,601 --> 00:16:27,401
Are you sure it's here?

170
00:16:29,861 --> 00:16:31,831
That means there are drugs in that villa.

171
00:16:31,831 --> 00:16:34,961
But the security is so tight and there's only one entrance.

172
00:16:34,961 --> 00:16:37,681
There's no way we can go through it.

173
00:16:37,681 --> 00:16:40,091
You're a prosecutor. Get a warrant.

174
00:16:40,091 --> 00:16:43,581
Do you think a warrant comes out of a coffee vending machine, for you to obtain it whenever you press a button?

175
00:16:43,581 --> 00:16:45,351
There has to be a reason for him to request one.

176
00:16:45,351 --> 00:16:49,611
You need something fishy in order to get a warrant.

177
00:16:49,611 --> 00:16:55,831
Even if there's something fishy, it's not like you can do it without Prosecutor Oh's knowledge.

178
00:16:58,221 --> 00:17:03,391
Oh, the security is way too tight for us to barge in ourselves.

179
00:17:03,391 --> 00:17:09,761
Oh, I guess Prosecutor Oh Ha Ra will find out if you request a warrant.

180
00:17:09,761 --> 00:17:13,051
Do we go with her knowledge or without her knowledge?

181
00:17:13,051 --> 00:17:18,711
Oh, to be or not to be.

182
00:17:23,391 --> 00:17:27,151
Nice sauna. Is it for both women and men?

183
00:17:28,761 --> 00:17:33,941
Why did you come here? This is our secret hangout. Did you tell her, Oppa?

184
00:17:33,941 --> 00:17:35,431
So petty. Did you follow me?

185
00:17:35,431 --> 00:17:38,951
I was meticulous to prevent (your wrongdoings). Didn't I tell you?

186
00:17:38,951 --> 00:17:41,701
that I always have to have preventive measures if I want to work with a con artist like you

187
00:17:41,701 --> 00:17:43,931
who likes to surprise me every now and then.

188
00:17:48,281 --> 00:17:50,061
Where is this place?

189
00:18:01,431 --> 00:18:06,131
One of them is worth one big one (100 million won).

190
00:18:06,131 --> 00:18:10,551
♫  Unforgettable  ♫

191
00:18:11,641 --> 00:18:16,441
♫  That's what you are  ♫

192
00:18:18,091 --> 00:18:21,461
♫  Unforgettable  ♫

193
00:18:23,221 --> 00:18:27,871
♫  Tho' near or far  ♫

194
00:18:30,061 --> 00:18:36,131
♫  Like a song of love that clings to me  ♫

195
00:18:37,151 --> 00:18:39,061
Call.

196
00:18:39,061 --> 00:18:40,601
Me, too. Call.

197
00:18:40,601 --> 00:18:42,261
Call.

198
00:18:45,021 --> 00:18:49,991
Your first win is very important when it comes to playing poker.

199
00:18:49,991 --> 00:18:55,491
You have to come on strong and win the first game so that you can bluff later.

200
00:19:00,611 --> 00:19:02,861
Call.

201
00:19:02,861 --> 00:19:06,911
- Me, too. Call. 
 - Call.

202
00:19:09,201 --> 00:19:13,651
♫  That's how you'll stay  ♫

203
00:19:17,801 --> 00:19:19,911
All in.

204
00:19:19,911 --> 00:19:22,971
♫  That's why, darling, it's incredible  ♫

205
00:19:22,971 --> 00:19:28,261
Prosecutor Jeong, you must have good cards.

206
00:19:28,261 --> 00:19:33,841
There's nothing to life. If you get a good set of cards, you take it.

207
00:19:33,841 --> 00:19:36,141
Here. Call.

208
00:19:36,141 --> 00:19:38,651
I'll go all in as well.

209
00:19:38,651 --> 00:19:43,371
Call.

210
00:19:57,671 --> 00:20:00,021
Oh... you win.

211
00:20:00,021 --> 00:20:03,601
Wow, nice cards!

212
00:20:13,051 --> 00:20:17,921
Prosecutor Jeong, you know that nothing is free in this world, right?

213
00:20:19,191 --> 00:20:25,621
Choi Sang Hyeon who escaped a few days ago in an accident and was arrested again, I heard he called Mr. Hwang.

214
00:20:25,621 --> 00:20:29,041
I'm concerned we might get traced.

215
00:20:29,041 --> 00:20:34,401
Nothing should happen to that Mr. Hwang.

216
00:20:35,161 --> 00:20:37,181
Do you understand, Prosecutor Jeong?

217
00:20:38,141 --> 00:20:42,841
Please call me if it looks like Prosecutor Baek is about to raid Mr. Hwang.

218
00:20:44,531 --> 00:20:46,391
I'll keep that in mind.

219
00:21:02,571 --> 00:21:06,231
That woman, Oh Ha Ra. Isn't she coming in too deep?

220
00:21:06,231 --> 00:21:10,761
This is our secret hangout. If she knows everything, is that considered secret?

221
00:21:10,761 --> 00:21:13,391
Hyung, I'm really nervous.

222
00:21:13,391 --> 00:21:18,441
And if we split up with Prosecutors Oh and Baek, that means we have to abandon this place.

223
00:21:19,691 --> 00:21:21,211
We shouldn't trust prosecutors.

224
00:21:21,211 --> 00:21:24,241
I'm sure Do Chan will take care of everything.

225
00:21:24,241 --> 00:21:28,581
Besides, there's no rule that says this is the only hangout we can have.

226
00:21:30,321 --> 00:21:33,571
Really? There are other places?

227
00:21:34,371 --> 00:21:38,301
You guys seem to lack trust in Do Chan.

228
00:21:38,301 --> 00:21:40,771
As expected of Oppa Do Chan ...

229
00:21:42,101 --> 00:21:45,751
Now I'm realizing that it's been quite some time that we've all worked together,

230
00:21:45,751 --> 00:21:48,471
but we don't know each other at all.

231
00:21:48,471 --> 00:21:50,191
How did you meet Oppa Do Chan?

232
00:21:50,191 --> 00:21:52,891
Why do you want to know that?

233
00:21:55,741 --> 00:22:01,451
I ran a venture capitalist run IT business but had to declare bankruptcy after being scammed.

234
00:22:03,081 --> 00:22:08,371
Hyung Do Chan helped me out then and here we are because of all that.

235
00:22:08,371 --> 00:22:12,441
Wow. You're amazing. You were a business owner at one time.

236
00:22:12,441 --> 00:22:15,801
I'm going to quit doing this once I get my business fund together.

237
00:22:15,801 --> 00:22:17,441
It's not like I'm Robin Hood.

238
00:22:17,441 --> 00:22:21,971
We just have to scam some rich people. But why work so hard?

239
00:22:21,971 --> 00:22:25,471
Why should we have to work so hard to pick out bad guys and scam them, huh?

240
00:22:26,631 --> 00:22:30,741
If everyone can understand everything and everyone, why would there be wars?

241
00:22:30,741 --> 00:22:34,701
A peaceful world. We'd live our lives saying, "We're the world."

242
00:22:35,591 --> 00:22:39,221
Eun Ji, how did you meet Do Chan?

243
00:22:39,221 --> 00:22:45,191
Well, I saved up my salary regularly working as a nurse,

244
00:22:45,191 --> 00:22:47,741
but my mom was scammed and lost everything.

245
00:22:47,741 --> 00:22:52,831
That's when Do Chan showed up, ta-da! And voila...

246
00:22:52,831 --> 00:22:54,561
That mission was so awesome.

247
00:22:54,561 --> 00:23:00,421
But as for me, I have so much... so much more fun doing this work than working as a nurse.

248
00:23:00,421 --> 00:23:01,691
It fits my personalit perfectly.

249
00:23:01,691 --> 00:23:04,541
It's not that you're having fun because you're with Hyung Do Chan?

250
00:23:04,541 --> 00:23:06,791
Don't be like that.

251
00:23:06,791 --> 00:23:12,951
Of course, that's a huge reason. But it's cool to scam the bad guys and let them have it.

252
00:23:12,951 --> 00:23:19,291
And if we do a big job, I'll go to some island in the South Pacific.

253
00:23:19,291 --> 00:23:21,311
How did you meet Do Chan Hyung, Director Bong?

254
00:23:21,311 --> 00:23:24,731
Right, you never told us about that.

255
00:23:24,731 --> 00:23:26,761
Huh?

256
00:23:26,761 --> 00:23:30,331
I don't really have a particular story.

257
00:23:32,611 --> 00:23:38,071
I was just close to Do Chan since his childhood.

258
00:23:39,561 --> 00:23:42,491
Your ramen is getting soggy. Aren't you going to eat?

259
00:23:42,491 --> 00:23:44,111
Eat.

260
00:23:55,231 --> 00:23:58,001
I heard your team got disbanded.

261
00:23:58,001 --> 00:24:02,961
That's good. You break it up this time, too. Break up with Prosecutor Baek. Stop seeing him now.

262
00:24:02,961 --> 00:24:05,321
This is all for your own good—

263
00:24:05,321 --> 00:24:08,211
I got it. I won't date. Satisfied?

264
00:24:08,211 --> 00:24:11,601
Did I say not to date? I said no to Prosecutor Baek.

265
00:24:11,601 --> 00:24:13,751
With that con artist?

266
00:24:13,751 --> 00:24:17,531
Really? Prosecutor Baek is a con artist?

267
00:24:19,461 --> 00:24:23,241
You said all men are con artists. That's what you always said, Mom.

268
00:24:23,241 --> 00:24:29,011
Yeah. Watch out for men with that in mind at all times.

269
00:24:35,771 --> 00:24:38,351
Mom, I'm leaving.

270
00:24:38,351 --> 00:24:42,751
Men always stab you in the back the moment you start to trust them.  Be careful!

271
00:24:42,751 --> 00:24:44,941
I believe in you.

272
00:24:45,641 --> 00:24:47,551
You'll do fine.

273
00:24:48,561 --> 00:24:52,111
I'll begin my briefing on Hwang Beom Do.

274
00:24:54,761 --> 00:24:58,481
This is the most recent photo.

275
00:25:00,731 --> 00:25:06,601
This is a photo of a villa that Hwang Beom Do owns under a false name.

276
00:25:06,601 --> 00:25:11,101
And this is the photo that was posted on a real estate website three years ago.

277
00:25:11,101 --> 00:25:15,351
The time, location, and composition of both photos are the same.

278
00:25:15,351 --> 00:25:17,581
Do you sense anything?

279
00:25:20,261 --> 00:25:21,451
What am I supposed to sense?

280
00:25:21,451 --> 00:25:24,001
I'm not sure.
   Hwang Beom Do's villa three years ago vs. Hwang Beom Do's current villa 

281
00:25:24,001 --> 00:25:25,751
Over there.

282
00:25:25,751 --> 00:25:28,811
Please take a look at the shadow that's being cast into the pool.

283
00:25:29,791 --> 00:25:34,191
The recent photo has slightly shorter shadow.

284
00:25:36,681 --> 00:25:40,931
The refractive index of the water is 1.33. But let's say 1 for the ease of calculation.

285
00:25:40,931 --> 00:25:42,711
All the conditions are the same.

286
00:25:42,711 --> 00:25:46,641
The distance from the sun to the surface of the water is X. The top surface of the water to the bottom of the pool is Y.

287
00:25:46,641 --> 00:25:50,471
If we were to label the remaining distance K and the length of the shadow as Z...

288
00:25:50,471 --> 00:25:52,161
According to the triangle formula theorem,

289
00:25:52,161 --> 00:25:57,161
X/X+Y=Z/K.

290
00:26:02,191 --> 00:26:07,361
Then you can get the the distance of the shadow K by multiplying X+Y and Z, then divide it by X.

291
00:26:07,361 --> 00:26:10,491
Wait... Prosecutor Baek.

292
00:26:10,491 --> 00:26:15,061
You know, I gave up on math. Can we make this simple?

293
00:26:16,301 --> 00:26:21,761
But what do you have to do if you want to shorten the shadow as seen in this photo?

294
00:26:21,761 --> 00:26:23,271
As I told you earlier,

295
00:26:23,271 --> 00:26:27,111
X/X+Y =Z/K. All the conditions are the same.

296
00:26:27,111 --> 00:26:29,761
The only variable that can exist is—

297
00:26:29,761 --> 00:26:31,551
Y.

298
00:26:32,671 --> 00:26:35,491
- The distance from the surface of the water to the bottom of the pool. 
 - Correct.

299
00:26:35,491 --> 00:26:38,941
Since a man can't move the sun to control the length of the shadow.

300
00:26:38,941 --> 00:26:43,431
It means the swimming pool's depth has changed for the shadow length to be changed.

301
00:26:43,431 --> 00:26:45,401
Ding-dong-dang. That means—

302
00:26:45,401 --> 00:26:50,601
There's something on the bottom of the swimming pool.

303
00:26:50,601 --> 00:26:54,741
Drugs. Should we request a warrant?

304
00:26:54,741 --> 00:26:56,201
It will leak to the special counsel.

305
00:26:56,201 --> 00:27:01,501
You're saying we need a reason that the higher-ups can't detect, right?

306
00:27:06,961 --> 00:27:09,391
Remodeling without a permit.

307
00:27:09,391 --> 00:27:13,661
Buzz. Correct answer is remodeling without a permit.

308
00:27:21,801 --> 00:27:23,721
Sounds great.

309
00:27:29,201 --> 00:27:32,041
This old man didn't come to work.

310
00:27:32,041 --> 00:27:34,291
What's this?

311
00:27:36,461 --> 00:27:40,511
I'm taking a few days off to attend the World Popcorn Forum?

312
00:27:41,761 --> 00:27:46,591
This old man. He asked me to form a business alliance. Where did he go?

313
00:28:14,741 --> 00:28:16,641
Hello.

314
00:28:18,661 --> 00:28:20,401
Hello.

315
00:28:20,401 --> 00:28:23,641
Governor Choi Jeong Pil sent me here.
