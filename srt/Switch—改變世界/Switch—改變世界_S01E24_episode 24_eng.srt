1
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:08,410


2
00:00:11,930 --> 00:00:15,230
Does it matter how many hands I have?

3
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:19,860
- Even though it looks like this, I have a big hand. 
 - A big hand?

4
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:24,240
Of course, with this one hand, I will be able to catch Brown Bear.

5
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:28,940
And with this one hand, I will be able to protect you.

6
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:31,350
- Me?
 - Of course.

7
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:35,630
Even if they are just words, thank you.

8
00:00:35,630 --> 00:00:37,660
Wait and see for yourself.

9
00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:51,130
Great angle to get pictures.

10
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:57,000
See. There is nothing for Prosecutor Baek.

11
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,630
He bought something at a mart and took a walk around the neighborhood.

12
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:03,310
There was no woman he was seeing.

13
00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:05,430
I told you it's not like that.

14
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:07,510
Thanks for your hard work.

15
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:19,020
 The popcorn man? No way... 

16
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:21,410
Bong!

17
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:32,780
Is the popcorn business doing well?

18
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:36,480
Oh, oh, sir! Hello.

19
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:40,740
This alley must be a good spot. The business is doing well.

20
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:44,460
You gave me the machine for free and gave me all the materials.

21
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:47,540
How can I repay you?

22
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:49,510
Live a good life.

23
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:51,660
I understand, yes.

24
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:54,700
Oh, my, mister!

25
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:59,090
I didn't recognize you. You look so nice.

26
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:02,020
Where... Are you going somewhere far away?

27
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:05,840
Yes, it seems I have to go somewhere quite far away.

28
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:10,270
 Geum Tae Woong 

29
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:17,100
 Geum Tae Woong 

30
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:23,860
Yes, CEO Geum.

31
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:28,490
Prosecutor Baek, you know that I'm signing the contract tomorrow, right?

32
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:31,760
Be sure to attend, Prosecutor Baek.

33
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:32,870
Me?

34
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:38,380
We have to open up the champagne bottle together. You're the one who made this deal happen.

35
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:47,080
You're supposed to spend good times with good people. Don't you think?

36
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:52,480
Yes, I understand. I'll see you tomorrow.

37
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:02,520
CEO Geum inviting me?

38
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,180
Good.

39
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:09,600
You go in there early and give me a signal. We can be right on time.

40
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:14,780
Shall we go over tomorrow's plan?

41
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:23,330
 When Geum Tae Woong brings in 200 billion won in bearer bonds to the Westin Hotel suite... 

42
00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:25,990
It's 200 billion won in bearer bonds.

43
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:31,610
 Victor will check the bonds and hand over the contract. 

44
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:39,090
 Geum Tae Woong will sign the contract and if we come barging in at that point... 

45
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:42,250
Congratulations.

46
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:45,940
 Warrant 

47
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:51,560
You're under arrest for violating the act on Additional Punishment for Specific Economic Crimes.

48
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,850
- Please take away the evidence. 
 - Yes, ma'am.

49
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:55,960
 Geum Tae Woong will be placed under arrest and  

50
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:59,710
  200 billion in bearer bonds will be seized as evidence and will be turned over to the National Treasury. 

51
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:02,660
 Does it have to go into the National Treasury? What a waste. 

52
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:05,370
- Please take away the evidence. 
 - Yes, sir.

53
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,130
Don't even think about it.

54
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:17,500
I'm just saying let me daydream.

55
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:23,670
- But you're not going to investigate into Victor, too, are you? 
 - Why do you ask?

56
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:27,740
Well, he cooperated in the investigation.

57
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:33,670
I am just suggesting to overlook the tiny mistakes he made while he was doing some business.

58
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:40,040
By any chance, do you have something to tell me?

59
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:43,170
Something to tell you? I don't.

60
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:49,560
When this strategy works out, just wait.

61
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:53,030
- Wait for what? 
 - I have lots to ask you.

62
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:03,010
Is it finally happening tomorrow?

63
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:05,720
Hyungnim, I finally see the end of the tunnel.

64
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:08,020
I planned our mission with Prosecutor Oh Ha Ra.

65
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:11,790
In order to avoid Geum Tae Woong's suspicion, you'll be arrested as well, President Victor.

66
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:15,740
That can prevent Geum Tae Woong's revenge.

67
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:18,490
Prosecutor Baek, you worked hard.

68
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:24,470
Good job.

69
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:54,200
 Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. 

70
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:56,740
 When I listen to Mozart's Requiem... 

71
00:05:56,740 --> 00:06:01,660
 I paint a portrait of a man who is dying in pain. 

72
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:10,080
Shall we begin our party?

73
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:27,770
All right. Is it today? Geum Tae Woong's deal?

74
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:30,260
Yes, we're all ready.

75
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:33,790
Something seems off. The way things are going.

76
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:36,010
What?

77
00:06:36,010 --> 00:06:38,950
Geum Tae Woong sold his building and his land, right?

78
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:40,820
Yes, I saw it for sure.

79
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:43,620
Then, where did all his money go?

80
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:49,130
As for that, didn't you say he's signing the contract with the bearer bonds?

81
00:06:49,130 --> 00:06:51,840
Did you see the bear bonds?

82
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,160
I'm not sure what you're saying...

83
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,420
We saw him putting the money in one basket.

84
00:06:56,420 --> 00:07:00,040
We couldn't confirm that he converted them into bearer bonds.

85
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:06,370
That's not something he can do in a day or two so quietly.

86
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:12,050
Deputy Prosecutor, you said you know someone at the FIU (Financial Intelligence Unit), right?

87
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:13,760
Yeah.

88
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,240
Let's go there.

89
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:17,510
Alright.

90
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:48,170
Hyung. Bang Bang War called me.

91
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:51,010
What does he say?

92
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:52,970
  Please save me, Hyungnim! 
Korea University Hospital, Room 201. 

93
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:55,070
Please save me, Hyungnim.

94
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:58,150
This jerk, seriously.

95
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:03,610
How much money did you give him that he doesn't even have money for hospital bill?

96
00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:07,580
He must've lost all of it gambling, huh? I heard gamblers gamble even when they lose their hand.

97
00:08:12,010 --> 00:08:14,250
- What's wrong? 
 - Huh?

98
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:19,620
I just realized we came empty-handed.

99
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:22,090
Go downstairs and get something.

100
00:08:22,090 --> 00:08:27,200
Seriously. You should've said that before we came up. What should I buy?

101
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,900
Apple mango juice.

102
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:32,780
Apple mango? What's that?

103
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:37,000
I don't want him to say we bought him something plain. If they don't have it, be sure you go looking for it.

104
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,730
Make sure you buy that one!

105
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:41,990
Go, go.

106
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:44,310
What apple mango...

107
00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:46,200
Let's go.

108
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:58,710
Excuse me.

109
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:18,660
Hi, Bang Bang War.

110
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:22,050
You jerk.

111
00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:42,410
Geez, that...

112
00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:44,520
Don't move. Stay right there!

113
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,750
Get him! Get him!

114
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:58,290
It's a trap. Move the car to the entrance of the hospital.

115
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:05,610
 Proscutor Oh 

116
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:09,660
Prosecutor Oh, did you find anything?

117
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:13,490
I'm sure he swept up all that cash in one basket.

118
00:10:13,490 --> 00:10:14,920
But I don't see any trace of that afterward.

119
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:19,930
By when can you check that out? I have to go meet Geum Tae Woong right now. There's not a lot of time left until the contract signing.

120
00:10:19,930 --> 00:10:23,060
We're working full force right now here.

121
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:25,800
Go there for now.

122
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:30,430
All right. If you see anything suspicious, call me right away.

123
00:10:55,730 --> 00:10:57,230
Geum Tae Woong isn't here yet?

124
00:10:57,230 --> 00:10:59,160
No, not yet.

125
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:09,030
 Director Kim 

126
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:12,050
Yes, Director Kim.

127
00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:14,310
This is Victor.

128
00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:18,690
What? Change the location for signing the contract?

129
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:21,230
All right.

130
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:24,740
Change the location? What does he mean?

131
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:29,190
CEO Geum Tae Woong doesn't have much time because he has to meet someone at the Incheon Port.

132
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:32,290
He wants me to come over there to sign the contract.

133
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,340
Nothing will happen.

134
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:38,890
Looks like he's got the money all prepared. Let's go.

135
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:48,330
After this job is over, catch up with your father.

136
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:58,130
Geum Tae Woong changed the contact signing location.

137
00:11:58,130 --> 00:11:58,900
To where?

138
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:02,280
Around Incheon Port. I'll text you the address.

139
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:03,360
Why did he change it?

140
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:06,480
I'll go there for now. If you see anything weird, call me.

141
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,150
Okay.

142
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:11,160
Look at this.

143
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:12,850
What?

144
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:17,210
The money was scattered all over, but is gathering around in one place.

145
00:12:17,210 --> 00:12:18,410
Liechtenstein.

146
00:12:18,410 --> 00:12:21,530
It's the most famous tax haven.

147
00:12:21,530 --> 00:12:24,150
Who owns that account?

148
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:26,770
WCON Company?

149
00:12:26,770 --> 00:12:30,820
Is the CEO of that company Geum Tae Woong?

150
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:32,370
Simon Jo.

151
00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:34,540
Simon Jo?

152
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:36,180
Have you heard of him?

153
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:38,530
It's my first time hearing that name.

154
00:12:38,530 --> 00:12:42,350
Simon Jo. Who could it be?

155
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:51,120
Director Bong! Are you okay?

156
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:56,080
Jo Seong Do, this jerk... How dare he take advantage of our benevolence?

157
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:09,580
It's CEO's special order. Please hand over your cell phones.

158
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:11,950
Isn't it rude when you want to sign the contract with me?

159
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:16,830
He values security. Please understand.

160
00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:43,440
I'm sorry. It's such a huge contract that I had so much to prepare.

161
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,260
Have a seat.

162
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:58,020
Prosecutor Baek has worked very hard for this deal to come to fruition.

163
00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:03,810
Wait, if all that money went in there...

164
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:06,720
I even checked up the flow of underground economy.

165
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:11,450
My conclusion is that no one exchanged 200 billion won in bearer bonds.

166
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:14,430
No one issued the bonds?

167
00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:18,860
Then, what is Geum Tae Woong trying to deal with?

168
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:23,120
It's a trap.

169
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:31,230
Did you bring the bonds with you?

170
00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:34,200
Of course. You got the contract, right?

171
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,130
Of course.

172
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:06,290
Do Chan isn't answering his phone.

173
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:08,480
He said he's meeting Geum Tae Woong today.

174
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:14,460
By chance, is Geum Tae Woong trying to sweep all of us into a basket?

175
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:25,720
Director Kim, you have the champagne ready, right?

176
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,270
Yes.

177
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:34,570
Are you going to pop the champagne before the deal is solidified?

178
00:15:34,570 --> 00:15:39,760
What do you mean the deal hasn't been solidified? We're all in one place together.

179
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:14,460
It was an amazing switch.

180
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:21,710
Sa Do Chan.

181
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,180
You were trying to catch me?

182
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:58,300
It was great! Just for a moment. For a very brief moment, this Geum Tae Woong fell for it.

183
00:16:59,090 --> 00:17:01,360
What are you talking about?

184
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,720
Your joking around has gone overboard.

185
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:05,620
Joking?

186
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:09,070
Joking.

187
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:14,910
Just because a child who used to ask for jjajang noodles (black bean sauce noodles) showed up,

188
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:18,210
do you know how much you cost me?

189
00:17:18,210 --> 00:17:19,960
My drug business got destroyed.

190
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:23,300
You even blew up the presidential candidate I had been working hard on.

191
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:26,310
It was all in your plan to use Victor.

192
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:30,830
A plot to take everything away from my storage.

193
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:42,770
Sa Do Chan. Did you want to take your father's revenge from 20 years ago that badly?

194
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:49,390
I should've gotten rid of you with him 20 years ago.

195
00:17:49,390 --> 00:17:53,020
What are you talking about? I tried to sell out Sa Do Chan...

196
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:56,540
Right! The man who tried to sell out Sa Do Chan.

197
00:17:56,540 --> 00:17:59,720
He's the real Baek Joon Soo.

198
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:05,970
He came to see me because he was about to lose his prosecutor's position due to the bribery scandal.

199
00:18:05,970 --> 00:18:12,030
He was sent to me under your plan, Sa Do Chan.

200
00:18:12,030 --> 00:18:13,610
Right?

201
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:22,210
I'm a prosecutor of Korea, Baek Joon Soo.

202
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:25,270
You're being too rude.

203
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:27,830
Stop it, Sa Do Chan!

204
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:32,690
Did you think I wouldn't know that you and Prosecutor Baek planned this together?

205
00:18:32,690 --> 00:18:39,080
I'll cut off your neck first and I won't forgive Prosecutor Baek either.

206
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:42,060
Why?

207
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:51,440
Can you show me the scar on your shoulder once more?

208
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:24,060
Answer. Please answer.

209
00:19:45,330 --> 00:19:48,360
I'll send you to your father who's in heaven.

210
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:52,220
Go and reunite in tears.

211
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:57,350
I'm disappointed that I don't get to see that in person.

212
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:11,140
What the heck.

213
00:20:33,330 --> 00:20:35,120
Father.

214
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,200
Sa Ma Cheon?

215
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:42,700
How could he...

216
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:09,540
How about it? Your father's hand is big, huh?

217
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:36,580
I shouldn't have sent him there earlier.

218
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:41,320
It's a trap. Geum Tae Woong, that punk...

219
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:54,090
Am I looking at a ghost right now?

220
00:21:54,090 --> 00:22:00,290
Sa Ma Cheon. Why appear now after living in hiding for the last 20 years?

221
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:17,740
Gates of Hell. The planner behind this fraud. Was it you?

222
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:24,140
Right. It's a gift I prepared to destroy you.

223
00:22:26,330 --> 00:22:30,190
Gates of Hell is befitting for a devil, right?

224
00:22:46,630 --> 00:22:52,020
No! Don't touch him! Don't touch him!

225
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:55,300
No! No!

226
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:04,650
Sa Do Chan.

227
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:15,100
No wonder. I thought it seemed perfect.

228
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:19,500
You must've prepared it for a long time.

229
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:23,670
But what can we do...

230
00:23:26,510 --> 00:23:32,130
I'm the one who caught you.

231
00:23:32,130 --> 00:23:34,200
Hyungnim!

232
00:23:37,730 --> 00:23:41,820
No! No! No!

233
00:23:43,570 --> 00:23:50,830
If you hurt my son, I'll come back from the grave, you devil!

234
00:23:54,070 --> 00:23:56,900
Hyungnim!

235
00:24:17,650 --> 00:24:19,720
Here! Over here!

236
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:23,120
Over here! Over here!

237
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:25,990
Over here!

238
00:24:25,990 --> 00:24:27,980
Prosecutor Back?

239
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:32,380
A forklift. Get the forklift.

240
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:34,060
Okay!

241
00:24:35,190 --> 00:24:38,960
Prosecutor Baek, are you okay?

242
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,600
Are you okay?

243
00:24:55,990 --> 00:24:59,500
Father... Father!

244
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:04,200
Father. Pull yourself together! I said pull yourself together!

245
00:25:10,410 --> 00:25:12,640
Do Chan.

246
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:19,870
Still,

247
00:25:24,830 --> 00:25:29,660
I get to call my son's name before I die.

248
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:34,310
What are you talking about? Who's dying? Get up!

249
00:25:34,310 --> 00:25:39,860
I was so happy to see you again.

250
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:46,130
I'm disappointed that I don't get to catch up with you.

251
00:25:47,910 --> 00:25:52,330
I've committed so many wrongdoings.

252
00:25:52,330 --> 00:25:54,730
I think I'll go to hell.

253
00:25:54,730 --> 00:25:59,190
Let's not meet in the same place.

254
00:26:00,390 --> 00:26:05,530
Where do you think you're going? Now now! Not now!

255
00:26:06,610 --> 00:26:12,270
You brat. Your heart beats fast as it always has.

256
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:18,100
A scammer's heart should beat slowly.

257
00:26:48,170 --> 00:26:50,200
Do Chan.

258
00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:54,810
Don't live like me.

259
00:26:56,790 --> 00:27:00,940
You only live once.

260
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:06,710
The biggest con in this world is to

261
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:13,570
win one person's heart completely.

262
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:19,330
Please, just like that,

263
00:27:19,330 --> 00:27:24,580
live a normal life while having a fun with a girl.

264
00:27:26,090 --> 00:27:28,590
I got it. I got it!

265
00:27:28,590 --> 00:27:31,950
Don't die! Don't die!

266
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:33,890
Son.

267
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:38,550
I'm sorry.

268
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:52,760
For my sins... even you...

269
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:16,830
Father. Father.

270
00:28:16,830 --> 00:28:19,660
Father!

271
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:36,060
Father.

272
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:48,390


273
00:28:48,390 --> 00:28:53,020
♫  Raise me up, stay down for me  ♫

274
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:57,670
♫  Raise me up from far away  ♫

275
00:28:57,670 --> 00:29:02,250
♫  Stay with me  ♫

276
00:29:02,250 --> 00:29:04,900
♫  By my side  ♫
