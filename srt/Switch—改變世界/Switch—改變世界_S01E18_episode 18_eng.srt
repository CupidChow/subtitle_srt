1
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:08,920
That scale, you're still wearing the necklace. You acted as if you'd never see me again.

2
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:16,210
It's not that, I forgot to take it off as I've been wearing it continuously.

3
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:19,010
What brings you here?

4
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:23,390
I followed you because I thought you might meet Sa Do Chan.

5
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:26,750
Sa Do Chan. I'll have to arrest him.

6
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:29,090
Do you really have to do it, Sunbae?

7
00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:32,100
It's not like he accepted any bribes.

8
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:35,170
He did so much for us during that time.

9
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:44,970
You surely do know it, I thought you didn't.

10
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:46,160
Sa Do Chan!

11
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:48,000
You must think I'm so easy. You're always like this with me.

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,370
You started first.

13
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:52,980
Come and catch me.

14
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:57,570
Feel Gallery? Why there?

15
00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:00,670
Break into that place. You'll find something.

16
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:04,460
I thought you were going after Chief Prosecutor. Why are you asking me to break into the Feel Gallery?

17
00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:08,840
Geum Tae Woong and Chief Prosecutor. They're connected somehow.

18
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:14,090
I received a report saying that the Feel Gallery helps with tax evasion for the rich.

19
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:18,550
The prosecutors' office started the investigation, but it ended dropping the charge.

20
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:23,670
The prosecutor who dropped the case is Jeong Do Yeong, the current chief prosecutor.

21
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,080
When was this?

22
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:29,300
The case where Jeong Do Yeong covered up Geum Tae Woong.

23
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:33,150
- Six years ago? 
 - Six years ago?

24
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:38,220
Six years ago...

25
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:43,960
Any evidence or circumstantial evidence that shows Jeong Do Yeong and Geum Tae Woong are meeting or that they're connected?

26
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:48,890
They're flawless. They meet in secret and I think they talk to each other using an unregistered phone.

27
00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:53,670
But that Jeong Do Yeong, there's this one day he goes to the Feel Gallery.

28
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:55,630
Every Saturday night at 10 pm

29
00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:58,610
he goes to the Feel Gallery alone when Geum Tae Woong isn't even there.

30
00:01:58,610 --> 00:02:03,410
What is he looking at there? What exactly is there?

31
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:11,400
That's why I need you, Sa Do Chan.

32
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:15,870
I know what you are saying.

33
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:19,220
The Feel Gallery's security is extraordinary.

34
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:21,880
I think it won't be easy.

35
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:24,180
You're good at one thing though.

36
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:35,100
Let's see. Aren't you working too closely with a con artist, Prosecutor Oh?

37
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:40,170
You said Prosecutors and Con Artist Team. Prosecutors and Con Artist Team.

38
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:42,110
Team?

39
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:46,490
Let's leave that out. It's kinda, you know...

40
00:02:46,490 --> 00:02:50,670
Prosecutors and Con Artist Combined Forces?

41
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:52,540
It's good right?

42
00:02:54,460 --> 00:03:01,610


43
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:07,110
 I'll support you with anything. 

44
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:12,530
 In turn, you can't forget about the Incheon case six years ago. 

45
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:23,790
The Incheon incident from six years ago?

46
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:29,720
Yeah. Prosecutor Oh is digging that far in the end.

47
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:46,730
 King of Faberge 

48
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:01,370
I'm Prosecutor Baek Joon Soo.

49
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:10,360
What kind of bastard are you?

50
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:15,430
I'm the General Secretary of Democratic National Party.

51
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:19,240
I'm the General Secretary of Korea's opposition party.

52
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:25,310
You're a young prick. Just because you're a prosecutor, do you think the world looks funny to you?

53
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:28,980
Who the hell are you that you're going around digging into my family and extended family?

54
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:32,220
My phone is ringing off the hook.

55
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:40,600
You want some money?

56
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:46,400
You purchased land that's 200,000 pyeong under a borrowed name on Jeju Island.

57
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:50,960
Right. I love nature, so I bought some land. So what?

58
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,440
You also changed the allowed use of your purchased land illegally.

59
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:58,920
I bought the land so that I can farm tangerines when I retire.

60
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:04,300
I'll send you tangerines by the case. So, stuff yourself with that and get lost.

61
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:09,400
March 5th of last year at the Dongseong Hotel. The grandson of Daebang Group chairman, Yang Gi Seong,

62
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,100
the former president's son, Myeong Jin Hyeok,

63
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:16,910
and foreign diplomat Park Yeong Jin. They threw a filthy drug party with famous actresses.

64
00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:21,740
Your son-in-law was there at that party, right?

65
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:24,910
I was dispatched to that location.

66
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:29,330
You have proof? I thought you didn't get anything out of it.

67
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:35,130
The proof that shows your daughter used drugs,

68
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:37,850
it's here.

69
00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:42,650
 Certified Analysis Report 

70
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:44,010
We took your daughter's hair sample.
  LSDT Drugs
 Hair 

71
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:46,320
We asked the National Forensics Service to examine it for drug content.

72
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:51,370
It showed that she took LSDT chronically.

73
00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:01,560
 National Forensic Service 

74
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:15,300
Prosecutor Baek, I mean Prosecutor Baek Joon Soo, why are you acting like this?

75
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:19,380
Let's resolve this over a conversation.

76
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:22,780
I'll... What would you like me to do?

77
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:27,630
Resign from your National Assemblyman's position tomorrow.

78
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:33,270
Declare your political retirement.

79
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:47,450
 General Secretary of National Justice Party, Lee Gil Ho, Declares Retirement From Politics 

80
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:52,790
Did you hear?

81
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:56,810
I heard Chief Prosecutor is entering the special election for the Assembly.

82
00:06:56,810 --> 00:07:00,510
This is trouble. How much longer do you need to wrap up your investigation?

83
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:01,770
I don't know for sure.

84
00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:03,470
You have to wrap it up quickly.

85
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:07,140
If he becomes an assemblyman, it will become much more difficult.

86
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:08,980
When he becomes an assemblyman, he will  receive all kinds of benefits.

87
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:13,430
The privilege of exemption from liability during the Assembly session ... We can't arrest him then.

88
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:15,220
I'll move as fast as I can.

89
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:16,870
Okay.

90
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:20,810
Congratulations.

91
00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:24,870
Please broaden your horizons in an even bigger world.

92
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:32,440
I want to continue to stay here,  but the political world won't leave me alone.

93
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:35,600
When I enter the political arena, I'll work harder for the welfare of the prosecutors' office

94
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,800
and to strengthen our stature in society.

95
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,350
Thank you.

96
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:42,920
Whatever I become, I'll visit you guys for sure.

97
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:45,940
You are welcome anytime.

98
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:49,650
Take care of our Prosecutor Baek.

99
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:52,200
Yes.

100
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:00,900
Fifty billion won?

101
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:02,470
This one egg?

102
00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:05,570
It's not just plain egg. It's a Faberge.

103
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:07,650
It's an egg.

104
00:08:07,650 --> 00:08:10,290
Russia's master jewelry artisan.

105
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:13,070
It became famous when Carl Faberge made them.

106
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:17,980
There are only 42 left in the world, and the most expensive one among them,

107
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:21,450
the so-called "King of Faberge" is here.

108
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:24,210
It's coming to the Feel Gallery.

109
00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:27,540
It's awesome. Fifty billion won.

110
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:29,550
So, you're saying we should steal this?

111
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:33,230
Hey, steal? Are we thieves?

112
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:39,410
I've always wondered, how are conning and stealing different?

113
00:08:39,410 --> 00:08:42,310
I guess you don't know that yet.

114
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:45,800
My money!

115
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,170
Your money.

116
00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:49,830
If I take this without your knowledge, it's stealing.

117
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:52,130
Of course.

118
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:55,400
Give it to me.

119
00:08:57,930 --> 00:09:00,140
Thank you, I'll put this to good use.

120
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:03,740
Con man! Oh.

121
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:06,140
That's conning.

122
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:10,140
All right. We should take pictures for the poster.

123
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:12,120
Okay.

124
00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:32,090
 Super Slow Motion 

125
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:38,660
Okay, In Tae, let's go.

126
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:46,200
Cut. Check it.

127
00:09:55,610 --> 00:09:57,030
This is cool.

128
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:59,510
I have arranged for the ad already.

129
00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:01,970
Okay. Post both of them.

130
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:03,890
Okay.

131
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:06,510
I'll go meet the spy.

132
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:08,870
Good work!

133
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,720
 Layout 

134
00:10:46,130 --> 00:10:48,080
Boss.

135
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,890
Yong Sik.

136
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:57,260
Good work.

137
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:09,640
The Feel Gallery is going to be hard to break into.

138
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:18,250
So nice.

139
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:19,880
The photographs are all about lighting.

140
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:23,740
Okay, test.

141
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:27,280
Groom, you're so beautiful. Bride, you look so brave.

142
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:29,270
Okay, one, two, three.

143
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:31,960
One more time.

144
00:11:32,970 --> 00:11:37,170
Lovely, lovely, lov...

145
00:11:37,170 --> 00:11:40,720
You know that you have to finish and leave in two hours due to our Faberge exhibit, right?

146
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,180
I got it.

147
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:44,940
We have two hours left.

148
00:11:45,770 --> 00:11:49,690
Groom, can you do this with your hands? And Bride, look down like this.

149
00:11:49,690 --> 00:11:51,210
So pretty.

150
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:54,760
Imagine that you're the prettiest. Why does this keep clicking?

151
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:56,720
Is it broken?

152
00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:02,680
Bride, put your hand on the Groom's shoulder like this.

153
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:05,670
Like this. Your fingers are so long and so pretty.

154
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:07,970
So great. One, two, let's take it one more time.

155
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:09,750
And erotic now.

156
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:12,620
You know, your lips... talking.

157
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:14,630
Again. One...

158
00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:18,280
Pictures are coming really well in here.

159
00:12:36,210 --> 00:12:37,840
I don't understand.

160
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:41,910
Prosecutor Baek Joon Soo looked as if he was going to get fired right away, yet he's back to work as if nothing ever happened.

161
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:45,030
Team Leader Han Ji Yeon came to me and confessed.

162
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:47,450
That Prosecutor Baek didn't know that it was a bribe when he received it.

163
00:12:47,450 --> 00:12:52,570
I'll never, never cover up or side with Prosecutor Baek.

164
00:12:52,570 --> 00:12:56,820
Logically, would he have brought it in his car the next day if he knew it was a bribe?

165
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:59,240
He should've put it away so that no one would know.

166
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,760
So that no one would know?

167
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:03,100
Looks like you've received quite a lot of bribes.

168
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:04,890
What...

169
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:08,840
Reporter Oh, you didn't use reverse interviewing skill on me again, did you?

170
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:12,720
That Team Leader Han, why did she give him the bribe?

171
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,440
Well, to try to look good to the prosecutor.

172
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,970
She gave it to him knowing he was a prosecutor?

173
00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:21,010
Prosecutors are popular.

174
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:30,280
Prosecutor Oh, let me interview you.

175
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:35,470
Reporter Oh, do the interview in the reporters' room. Can't you see that I'm busy?

176
00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:46,250
This is going to go out tomorrow as my article. Will you help me pick out a good headline?

177
00:13:47,850 --> 00:13:51,980
"Prosecutor Baek of Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office. The truth behind his bribery charge."

178
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:56,810
Okay, okay. Keep working hard.

179
00:13:56,810 --> 00:14:01,250
"Prosecutor Baek of Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office turns out to be a con artist."

180
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:03,000
This?

181
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:09,050
- Oh So Ra.
 - Now, I'm getting a reaction.

182
00:14:09,730 --> 00:14:12,860
I saw Prosecutor Baek coincidently recently.

183
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:16,070
He was meeting Team Leader Han.

184
00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:18,540
In a hospital.

185
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:23,880
What's more amazing is that Prosecutor Baek was wearing a doctor's gown when he met with Team Leader Han.

186
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:28,980
I was doubtful at first. Is it a doctor who looks like Prosecutor Baek?

187
00:14:29,890 --> 00:14:34,330
Team Leader didn't give him the bribe thinking that he was a prosecutor. She gave it to him thinking he was a doctor.

188
00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:38,180
It's a fraud case where a prosecutor was pretending to be a doctor.

189
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:41,730
I can publish this now right?

190
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:44,440
I'm leaving. Work hard.

191
00:14:46,810 --> 00:14:48,730
Oh So Ra!

192
00:14:53,090 --> 00:14:56,290
Oh So Ra, you can never publish that. Ever.

193
00:14:56,290 --> 00:14:58,180
Why not? Let me have a breaking news.

194
00:14:58,180 --> 00:15:01,170
A prosecutor pretends to be a doctor. How great a story is that?

195
00:15:01,170 --> 00:15:02,480
I said not to!

196
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:05,320
You guys are that close?

197
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,320
It's not that.

198
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:10,100
What do you mean no? You two were so lovey-dovey from the time I saw you together.

199
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:13,470
That's why I'm a reporter and I'm using that.

200
00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:16,280
How much do you know, Unni?

201
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:23,560
Okay then! I'll tell you everything.

202
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:27,280
But keep it as a secret, okay?

203
00:16:21,570 --> 00:16:25,640
How have you been, my kids?

204
00:16:30,330 --> 00:16:36,470
Yes, my kids are so cute.

205
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:42,520
Right, cheer up!

206
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:46,340
To up there, a little more!

207
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:48,960
Let's go up!

208
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:51,330
To the king!

209
00:16:58,230 --> 00:17:03,970
 April 22
 Faberge Egg Exhibit Opening Day 

210
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:21,160
- Hello.
 - Welcome.

211
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:27,440
How could it be so splendid?

212
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:30,850
Isn't it amazing it's an egg?

213
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:34,450
Seriously, it's so amazing.

214
00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:39,170
So elaborate!

215
00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:42,040
This is so beautiful.

216
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:47,270
Everyone, you're looking at a Faberge egg right now.

217
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:50,960
As expected, the fame of Faberge.

218
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:54,970
I get to see the King of Faberge in my lifetime.

219
00:17:54,970 --> 00:17:57,570
I can't believe it.

220
00:17:57,570 --> 00:18:00,410
Excuse me.

221
00:18:04,030 --> 00:18:05,850
Look at this.

222
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:14,610
 I'll take your King 
 2018.4.22 
 from SDC. 

223
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:18,680
 I'll take your King 
 2018.4.22 
 from SDC. 

224
00:18:19,170 --> 00:18:21,050
 FEEL 

225
00:18:21,050 --> 00:18:22,890
 EGG 
 WE WILL 

226
00:18:22,890 --> 00:18:25,920
 BANG! 
 ROCK YOU 

227
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:29,360
 From SDC 

228
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:31,070
What is this?

229
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:36,160
 FEEL -- WE WILL -- BANG! -- ROCK YOU 

230
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:41,580
 From SDC 

231
00:18:43,970 --> 00:18:46,190
 I'll take your King 

232
00:18:46,190 --> 00:18:51,530
I heard this is an ad that says he's going to steal the Faberge egg that's at the Feel Gallery.

233
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:54,240
Those thieves. They're so gutsy.

234
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:57,400
 From SDC 

235
00:19:00,170 --> 00:19:03,440
Who would dare to play this kind of game?

236
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:08,480
I called up the ad agency, but it was requested anonymously, so they can't find out who the client is.

237
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:16,240
"Your King..." You're going to steal the King of Faberge?

238
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:19,700
SDC.

239
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:23,810
So Do Chan? Can it be him?

240
00:19:26,110 --> 00:19:32,300
Look at this guy. He's challenging me to my face, huh?

241
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:34,340
How should I handle this?

242
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:51,680
Leave him alone. He'll come since he put out an ad.

243
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:56,440
Tell Prosecutor Baek to request police support secretly.

244
00:19:56,440 --> 00:20:00,120
Tell him to secure the gallery premises, so that nothing leaks out.

245
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:01,880
I understand.

246
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:10,970
Fine. I'll be waiting with my mouth wide open.

247
00:20:10,970 --> 00:20:15,270
I'll eat you up when you come in.

248
00:20:17,610 --> 00:20:21,270
- Prosecutor Baek, you saw that strange ad, too, right? 
 - Yes.

249
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:26,010
The way I see it, it might be a prank. But you never know, so

250
00:20:26,010 --> 00:20:28,090
go and discuss security measures.

251
00:20:28,090 --> 00:20:30,010
I understand.

252
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:37,480
Sunbae.

253
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:41,810
Let's have a talk.

254
00:20:51,970 --> 00:20:57,020
I... am investigating the chief prosecutor.

255
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:02,100
But you keep getting in the way, Sunbae.

256
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:05,080
Don't you know I meet with the chief prosecutor quite often these days?

257
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:07,600
You think I'd stand back and watch?

258
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:11,210
This is your last chance.

259
00:21:11,210 --> 00:21:15,340
If you lose this chance, you might get hurt.

260
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:19,870
If you turn out to be an accomplice of the chief prosecutor,

261
00:21:19,870 --> 00:21:22,700
I'll press charges and indict you according to the book.

262
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:30,430
Can you not go back to being

263
00:21:32,610 --> 00:21:34,150
same Baek Joon Soo that I used to know?

264
00:21:34,150 --> 00:21:38,540
Do whatever you want to do. I'll go my way.

265
00:21:39,410 --> 00:21:44,090
I'll catch Sa Do Chan. You stay out of my way.

266
00:21:44,090 --> 00:21:45,670
♫  I feel jealous  ♫

267
00:21:45,670 --> 00:21:48,460
Sunbae.

268
00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:53,210
Were you like this?

269
00:21:53,210 --> 00:21:57,650
♫  I feel your warmth  ♫

270
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:04,520
♫  The lighthouse in my dream  ♫

271
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:07,980
♫  which stands alon  ♫

272
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:10,130
 What's the second thing? 

273
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:15,080
♫  looks only at you who are lost.  It's you.  ♫

274
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:18,610
 Please guarantee Prosecutor Oh Ha Ra's safety. 

275
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:20,730
♫  Raise me up, stay there for me  ♫

276
00:22:20,730 --> 00:22:22,710
 Would that be enough? 

277
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:24,640
♫  Raise me up  ♫

278
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:27,780
 Fine.  
♫  though far away  ♫

279
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:32,450
 I won't touch Prosecutor Oh Ha Ra. 

280
00:22:32,450 --> 00:22:35,240
♫  By my side  ♫

281
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:39,530
♫  By my side  ♫

282
00:22:40,890 --> 00:22:44,480
♫  By my side  ♫

283
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:48,690
♫  Please stay  ♫

284
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:57,110
 April 22 

285
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:03,640
Special gas pressure sensor.

286
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:14,810
 Over there. The CCTV. 

287
00:23:26,370 --> 00:23:30,120
We might never see it if we don't see it today. Do you think he's really going to steal it?

288
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:32,400
No way.

289
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,820
CEO, would it be okay?

290
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:37,250
I'm worried because of that strange ad.

291
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:38,590
Don't worry.

292
00:23:38,590 --> 00:23:43,480
Our Feel Gallery has a world-class security system.

293
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:46,200
The basic security system already uses state-of-the-art technology.

294
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:50,240
We especially consulted the Manhattan Security company in the US.

295
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:53,710
We installed a special gas-pressure sensor.

296
00:23:54,390 --> 00:23:58,300
This display is completely sealed.

297
00:23:58,300 --> 00:24:01,240
Even an ant can't go in, nor come out.

298
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:07,400
Please don't worry and enjoy the King of Faberge exhibit.

299
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,470
So cool.

300
00:24:08,470 --> 00:24:10,840
So great.

301
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:12,900
Wow. Look at this.

302
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:15,960
What's going on?

303
00:24:19,690 --> 00:24:22,530
What, what?

304
00:24:22,530 --> 00:24:25,740
What's going on?

305
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:29,000
Security, security!

306
00:24:29,870 --> 00:24:31,800
What's going on?

307
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:33,940
What's going on?

308
00:24:35,170 --> 00:24:36,460
We're ready.

309
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:38,960
Me, too.

310
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:42,850
We're not late, are we?

311
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:12,730
Please don't worry.

312
00:25:12,730 --> 00:25:15,290
I guess there was a slight variance with this special security system.

313
00:25:15,290 --> 00:25:19,480
The King of Faberge. It's still there.

314
00:25:21,970 --> 00:25:23,310
Yes, yes...

315
00:25:36,930 --> 00:25:38,940
Is it okay?

316
00:25:43,870 --> 00:25:46,060
Is it going to rain?

317
00:25:55,690 --> 00:25:57,490
What's wrong?

318
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:01,610
What the heck?

319
00:26:01,610 --> 00:26:03,680
Oh, my.

320
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:06,010
Look at that!

321
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:12,370
Let's go.

322
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:15,250
Okay.

323
00:26:23,110 --> 00:26:25,360
What's wrong with it?

324
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:28,630
 Today!!! 

325
00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:32,360
What's that?

326
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:37,930
But, what's happening?

327
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:40,140
Why is it doing that?

328
00:26:42,410 --> 00:26:45,870
 Today, at the Feel Gallery holding the King of Faberge exhibit, 
   

329
00:26:45,870 --> 00:26:48,450
 an incredible thing happened. 

330
00:26:48,450 --> 00:26:50,350
 Two days ago, through an anonymous ad, 

331
00:26:50,350 --> 00:26:53,880
 there was a commercial declaring they'd steal the Faberge egg that drew much attention. 

332
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:55,240
 But getting through such a tight security, 

333
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:57,500
 the fact that such a warning message was sent, 

334
00:26:57,500 --> 00:27:01,310
 has the citizens very much concerned that the robbery could actually occur. 

335
00:27:01,310 --> 00:27:03,810
 The Feel Gallery urgently canceled the exhibit. 

336
00:27:03,810 --> 00:27:06,640
 The Scoop 
An anonymous thief is targetting CEO Geum Tae Woong's personal safe. Korean Lupin, what is he after? There's a rumor that he's targetting the Feel Gallery basement second level. 

337
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:09,480
 The Feel Gallery is preparing just in case the Faberge egg is stolen 

338
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:10,770
 or is damaged. 

339
00:27:10,770 --> 00:27:12,530
 The exhibit has been canceled. 

340
00:27:12,530 --> 00:27:15,230
 Everyone, please leave. 

341
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:32,480
 Today's exhibit has been canceled. 

342
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:35,300

354
00:28:28,170 --> 00:28:31,700
Something's off. I called Manhattan Security.

355
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:35,020
I heard they turned around on their way over here five days ago.

356
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:38,620
What are you talking about? They turned around on their way over here?

357
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:43,120
I think the security staff was fooled.

358
00:28:44,150 --> 00:28:50,980
The Russian government wants us to return the artwork by midnight tonight due to security concerns.

359
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:54,910
- But there is no problem with the exhibit artwork.
 - Is that the problem right now?

360
00:28:56,210 --> 00:29:02,180
This shame... I'll never forgive him,

361
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:04,510
whoever he may be. Never.

362
00:29:08,270 --> 00:29:11,310
We have one more hour to go until midnight.

363
00:29:11,310 --> 00:29:18,630
One hour... Are they saying they're going to come in an hour and take this?

364
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:31,280
He's a lot more fearless than I thought, Sa Do Chan.

365
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:37,160
Please don't worry. The police force commander is my colleague. I placed him secretly.

366
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:39,700
Thank you.

367
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:43,080
What are you going to do when you catch Sa Do Chan?

368
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:45,870
I'll turn him over to the police.

369
00:29:45,870 --> 00:29:50,260
No. Give him to me.

370
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:58,650
Hand him over to me entirely. And don't ask me about him after that.

371
00:30:01,290 --> 00:30:03,310
This is a trap, right?

372
00:30:03,310 --> 00:30:06,270
I heard you placed the police force on standby.

373
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:10,670
"Don't ask me how he's doing."

374
00:30:10,670 --> 00:30:14,800
Sa Do Chan. I guess you're going to kill him off?

375
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:44,760
Ten minutes remaining.

376
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:55,920
I'm dying of curiosity. He's going to take this in 10 minutes?

377
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:59,400
How could he?

378
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:35,250

 That's the big store for us tonight. 

385
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:53,180
 What do you mean the Faberge egg opened up? 

386
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:55,530
 Combining a prosecutor and con artist is unbeatable. 

387
00:31:55,530 --> 00:31:57,800
 Oh Ha Ra, Sa Do Chan. 

388
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:59,820
 The two of them planned this from the get-go. 

389
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:02,340
 Find him now! Drag him here now! 

390
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:05,040
 He's aggressively looking for Sa Do Chan. Be careful. 

391
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:07,030
 Do Chan, save me! 

392
00:32:07,030 --> 00:32:10,850
 What they were after was the person whom I was going go make into a king. 

393
00:32:10,850 --> 00:32:12,390
 They were after Chief Prosecutor. 

394
00:32:12,390 --> 00:32:16,370
If there is evidence that you purchased this knowing it was fake, then there will be no problem.

395
00:32:16,370 --> 00:32:19,340
 Should we remove the veil that was hiding the truth? 

396
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:25,870
 Jeong Do Yeong, you're now a suspect in the murder of Bong Man Gyu from six years ago.
