1
00:00:01,950 --> 00:00:04,350
What is...

2
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:07,920
What is that noise?

3
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:10,930
I heard they're building a nursing home on the mountain in front.

4
00:00:10,930 --> 00:00:17,410
A nursing home in front? Are they trying to mess up the view from my house?

5
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:19,790
Tell them to stop the construction immediately.

6
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:20,920
Pardon?

7
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:23,480
Did you not understand?

8
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:29,060
If the mayor keeps up with the construction, tell him I'm going to take that position away from him.

9
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:31,130
Yes, sir.

10
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:36,440
Governor, CEO Geum Tae Woong is here.

11
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:41,590
Geum Tae Woong? What is he doing in my house?

12
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:47,930
Let's see what he has to say. Let him in.

13
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:57,700


14
00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:05,790
Have you been well?

15
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:12,250
Yes. Thankfully I've been living very well.

16
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:18,250
 Please tell him that you have a voice recording. 

17
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:22,570
 And tell him that you gave it over to Sa Do Chan. 

18
00:01:22,570 --> 00:01:27,450
 Then I will arrest Geum Tae Woong. 

19
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:34,830
Yes. What do you have to say?

20
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:37,810
I heard an obnoxious rumor.

21
00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:40,670
I heard from Prosecutor Baek

22
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:44,740
that you gave Sa Do Chan some kind of voice recording.

23
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:53,370
The one I recorded when you reported to me that you would run Prosecutor Baek over with a car?

24
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:56,100
Yeah, I gave it to him. Why?

25
00:01:57,770 --> 00:02:00,970
Governor, are you messing with me?

26
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:04,540
You took away my Namsan Club from me!

27
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:08,060
You took away my bank. Are you a human?

28
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:11,090
I learned this from you for the last 20 years.

29
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:12,000
You bastard!

30
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,420
To trick, betray, and steal.

31
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:22,260
The reason you have been wearing nice clothes so far

32
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:25,990
is all because I helped you do your dirty work without any complaint.

33
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:26,900
How dare you!

34
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:30,330
You told me that you think of me as a son, right?

35
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:34,130
And you promised me that you would pass on all of your things to me.

36
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:40,460
Since you aren't following through with your promise, I'm taking it early by my own means.

37
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:42,920
I just changed the order.

38
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:46,820
My daughter, Mi Na.

39
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:50,430
You killed her, right?

40
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:00,480
 Mi Na!  Mi Na! 

41
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:26,340
You killed her and lied to me  that the Sa Ma Cheon did it, right?

42
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:28,670
You got married to her as a scam

43
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:32,300
and you killed my daughter. Are you even a human?

44
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:36,360
You're a devil in a human's body!

45
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:42,660
You and I both lived with no order or rules in our lives.

46
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:45,580
I can never forgive you.

47
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:52,460
When I go to hell, I will be sure to take you there with me.

48
00:03:54,870 --> 00:04:00,980
Do you think your tower will last long just because you're building it up high?

49
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:05,300
It will fall down. Just you watch.

50
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:11,320
In order to break you down, Prosecutor Baek Joon Soo

51
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:18,970
or Scammer Sa Do Chan, I will ally with them. If a dog bites a human,

52
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:22,020
you have to sell the dog.

53
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:31,860
If you don't behave like this, I have no other choice.

54
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:35,020
This is a warning.

55
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:50,260
Simon Jo. Jo Seong Doo is the hidden son of Geum Tae Woong.

56
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:54,250
The guy that came and left the other day was Geum Tae Woong's son?

57
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:58,430
Yes. What's funny is that he doesn't know.

58
00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:02,110
Geum Tae Woong just borrowed Jo Seong Doo's name.

59
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:03,820
Really?

60
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,730
Hey!

61
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:09,820
Have you been well?

62
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:12,950
Uncle, I received the call from downstairs.

63
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:14,490
What brings you all the way here?

64
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:17,920
I came to ask a favor.

65
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,270
Yes, sit down first, please.

66
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:22,290
Alright.

67
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,640
Then, I'll get going.

68
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:29,040
No it's fine, just stay a bit. Prosecutor Oh. Sit down.

69
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:33,670
This is our best officer in our Criminal Investigation Division 6. Be comfortable around her.

70
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:44,400
It's not a huge deal but this guy and I are so close that we call each other brothers.

71
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:49,180
He said he had a hard issue so I brought him here with me. You can listen to what he has to say, right?

72
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:51,860
Of course. I will listen to anything!

73
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:53,190
Please tell me.

74
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:56,700
This friend of mine opened a hospital!

75
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:58,440
A hospital run by an investor without a medical license.

76
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:04,230
But the financial supervisory service keeps coming out for investigations.

77
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:07,140
Can you stop the investigations for him?

78
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:08,920
Oh, that's...

79
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:12,050
Prosecutor Oh, you can hear him out, right?

80
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:16,390
If someone who is not a medical doctor opens up a hospital, that's violating the health industry laws.

81
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:20,200
It can be violating the special law for preventing health insurance fraud.

82
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,820
So then what happens?

83
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:24,720
If it's proven that it violated the health insurance fraud act, prison time up to 10 years

84
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,980
or a fine up to 50 million won can be sentenced.

85
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:30,730
It sounds like it might be a bit hard.

86
00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:34,460
I came to ask you since it was a hard case.

87
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:36,130
Yes.

88
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:39,490
He says it's a hard issue.

89
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:43,740
If you can't do it through the law, you can't do it at all.

90
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:45,840
She says you can't do it.

91
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:50,080
I came here because you're a deputy prosecutor.

92
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,900
Are you joking with me right now?

93
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:54,300
It's not a joke, Uncle.

94
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:57,620
A relative is a relative and a prosecutor is a prosecutor.

95
00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:02,130
Prosecutor Oh, what kind of cirme is it if you ask for an illegal favor like this?

96
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:06,370
Crime?! This brat!

97
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:17,120
Then, I'll see you at the family gathering.

98
00:07:26,370 --> 00:07:28,050
Thank you.

99
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:30,270
You've worked hard.

100
00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:43,260
Prosecutor Baek says he had more questions and summoned him again.

101
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:02,330
I will stop the recording for a moment.

102
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:12,640
If you're going to talk about that again, I definitely rejected it.

103
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:20,060
Guem Tae Woong said it,

104
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:23,030
that you have the voice recording.

105
00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:24,190
Voice recording?

106
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:29,490
Geum Tae Woong told Choi Jeong Pil that he was going to run me, Baek Joon Soo, over with a car, disguising it as an accident.

107
00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:32,630
And Choi Jeong Pil recorded that.

108
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:34,980
Prosecutor Baek, you lie now.

109
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:39,830
Because of that, your life is in more danger.

110
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:44,270
Whenever Geum Tae Woong gets a chance, he's going to try to kill you.

111
00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:50,040
So because of that, I am going to help you escape.

112
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:52,790
Escape?

113
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:59,530
There is an infirmary in the detention center but in emergency cases, patients have to be transferred to a hospital outside.

114
00:08:59,530 --> 00:09:06,740
In that ambulance, Sa Do Chan will escape and if that news gets to Geum Tae Woong's ears,

115
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:10,220
he's going to try to kill you for sure.

116
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:15,800
In the end, Sa Do Chan will die in the hands of Geum Tae Woong's men.

117
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:21,760
But in the end, the person that will die will be me.

118
00:09:22,650 --> 00:09:28,730
In that ambulance, I will switch our bodies.

119
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:38,260
That's an amazing scenario. It was a nice listen.

120
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:51,940
Your scenario and my scenario.

121
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:57,150
Let's see who's scenario it turns out to be.

122
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:05,000
Sa Do Chan isn't the type to just sit back.

123
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,810
He is getting on my nerves.

124
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:17,500
Just like Jeong Do Yeong last time, take care of him quietly.

125
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:20,840
If we keep repeating the same method, they can catch us.

126
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:25,130
Prosecutor Oh Ha Ra is digging into Jeong Do Yeong's suicide incident as well.

127
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:29,470
Then, do you have another way?

128
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:36,920
The snacks have arrived.

129
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:39,030
Thank you.

130
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:42,800
Prosecutor, your snacks are here.

131
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:47,020
Please enjoy it with them.

132
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:48,960
Thank you.

133
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:24,510
Prosecutor!

134
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:25,480
Prosecutor! Hey!

135
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,660
- Hyungnim! 
 - Warden!

136
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:30,820
A man collapsed!

137
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:32,700
Do Chan collapsed?

138
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:35,020
Yes, right about now.

139
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:39,560
Then, did Geum Tae Woong do that to kill our Do Chan?

140
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:41,010
I did that.

141
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:43,420
What? Why would you...

142
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:46,890
Go to the detention center right away and take Sa Do Chan.

143
00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:50,090
I've already talked to the correctional officers.

144
00:11:50,890 --> 00:11:54,000
Are you saying we should have him escape from jail?

145
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,520
Sa Do Chan also agreed. Please hurry and go.

146
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:02,850
Let's go!

147
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:21,760
He's in danger! We have to move him to a bigger hospital!

148
00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:24,790
Hurry!

149
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:30,310
 Director Kim Hyeon Wook 

150
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:40,700
I heard that Sa Do Chan collapsed in jail.

151
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:42,770
Sa Do Chan?

152
00:12:42,770 --> 00:12:47,660
Yes. He's at the infirmary right now, but he'll be moved to a hospital soon.

153
00:12:48,770 --> 00:12:53,080
If they're putting on a show to escape,

154
00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:58,300
this is a great chance for us to get rid of him.

155
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:02,860
Director Kim, chase after him right now.

156
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:06,600
If he tries to escape, get him and bring him here.

157
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,820
Yes, sir.

158
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:09,760
Director Kim.

159
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:17,640
If you miss him again this time, I won't forgive you.

160
00:13:25,890 --> 00:13:31,660
Sa Do Chan, I'll finish you off this time for sure.

161
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:44,480
 Establish law and rules: Detention Center 

162
00:13:47,270 --> 00:13:49,560
Follow the ambulance.

163
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,610
He's escaping as expected. Continue to chase after it.

164
00:14:12,610 --> 00:14:14,390
Okay.

165
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:21,290
 Guri 

166
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:36,760
This is a good spot.

167
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:41,080
Prosecutor Baek, must you go to this extent?

168
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:44,150
Please take care of the rest.

169
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:56,140
Get him!

170
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:14,840
 Prosecutor Oh Ha Ra 

171
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:22,510
Prosecutor Oh! Sa Do Chan fled while being transported to the hospital.

172
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:25,360
Sa Do Chan did?

173
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:29,920
 Mr. Sa who's been taken into a custody for attempted murder and fraud 

174
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,860
 has escaped from jail today. 

175
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:34,230
 Mr. Sa collapsed suddenly in jail. 

176
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:36,790
 He escaped while being transported to a nearby hospital. 

177
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:39,720
 The police are chasing along his escape route and searching nearby.
  

178
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:40,680
 They're paying special attention to the safety of the citizens. 

179
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:42,590
Are they saying that con artist escaped?

180
00:16:42,590 --> 00:16:44,920
Escape? Whoa.

181
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:47,630
Amazing. He's not just an ordinary con artist.

182
00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:50,030
Where is he going if he's running away?

183
00:16:50,030 --> 00:16:51,230
Hey, hey, where are you going?

184
00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:54,760
Where else? Huge news just broke.

185
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:00,800
Estimated time of the incident?

186
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:03,340
Have all reporter ready.

187
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:09,330
Confirm your information and hand it over to me quick.

188
00:17:16,650 --> 00:17:18,310
Oppa, are you okay?

189
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:20,590
Director Bong!

190
00:17:21,830 --> 00:17:26,880
Do Chan! Do Chan! Are you okay?

191
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:30,670
How about Prosecutor Baek?

192
00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:37,760
 Prosecutor Baek does what he says he'll do, huh? 

193
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:42,260
 Of course. A timid man like that is even scarier when he is stubborn. 

194
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:45,860
 So, I think we should set things up. 

195
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:49,170
 Setting? What is it? 

196
00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:52,500
 It may seem as if it's according to Prosecutor Baek's scenario. 

197
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:56,700
 But actually, I'll be handling it above him. 

198
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,040
 In Tae, follow the ambulance that Prosecutor Baek is riding in. 

199
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:21,760
 Be prepared and take away Prosecutor Baek. 

200
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,780
Things are going according to my plan.

201
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:27,830
Do Chan. This isn't right.

202
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:30,920
We did succeed, but it was too dangerous.

203
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:33,830
I'll never do a setting like this ever again.

204
00:18:34,770 --> 00:18:38,140
 Prosecutor Baek, don't be too disappointed 

205
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:40,630
 since it went according to my scenario. 

206
00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:45,720
 I am not going to lose anyone from now on including Oh Ha Ra and you. 

207
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:58,530
You lost him? What did I tell you?

208
00:18:58,530 --> 00:19:02,170
This would never have happened if you had killed him while he was in jail!

209
00:19:02,170 --> 00:19:04,560
I'm sorry.

210
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,940
It must hurt.

211
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:09,640
I heard what happened.

212
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:14,130
We don't know where Sa do Chan's going to go. Who knows when he's going to show up to hurt you, CEO?

213
00:19:14,130 --> 00:19:17,640
On top of that, Baek Joon Soo is alive and well in the prosecutors' office.

214
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:21,440
Director Kim, how many times have you made mistakes?

215
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:24,870
How much longer do I have to forgive you?

216
00:19:28,330 --> 00:19:30,280
Get out.

217
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:12,530
It's not like I have a wife or children.

218
00:20:12,530 --> 00:20:17,830
The gallery and my assets. Who would I leave them to when I retire?

219
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:22,110
You know that you're the only person I have, right?

220
00:20:26,530 --> 00:20:29,530
I'm telling you this because I feel like you're my son.

221
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:37,120
I was just used in the end.

222
00:20:47,430 --> 00:20:49,690
Burn it.

223
00:21:35,690 --> 00:21:39,510
A diplomatic pouch is very convenient.

224
00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:44,020
Bringing something like this without going through customs.

225
00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:51,260
How about you bring it inside a huge sculpture next time?

226
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:56,760
I heard your name is Brown Bear.

227
00:21:57,570 --> 00:22:00,060
You don't have to know.

228
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:46,100
Hello, Prosecutor Baek.

229
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:48,690
Good morning, Mi Ran.

230
00:23:06,050 --> 00:23:07,830
- Inspector Go. 
 - Yes.

231
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:11,180
Please review all the records of the prison inmates in Seoul jail.

232
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:12,220
Why do you need that...

233
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:15,410
It could be a murder disguised as an escape.

234
00:23:15,410 --> 00:23:16,970
Okay.

235
00:23:16,970 --> 00:23:18,790
- Inspector Im. 
 -  Yes.

236
00:23:18,790 --> 00:23:22,930
Please obtain all CCTV recordings near the jail.

237
00:23:22,930 --> 00:23:27,010
- Also for the CCTVs installed at the nearby highways.
 - Yes, I got it.

238
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:34,600
Sunbae, why have you been so out of touch?

239
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:39,620
You heard about Sa Do Chan escaping, right?

240
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:41,270
Yeah.

241
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:20,570
I'm so great at fooling people.

242
00:24:20,570 --> 00:24:23,680
Prosecutor Baek asked me to keep it a secret.

243
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:33,460
Sa Do Chan will be alright, huh?

244
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:36,890
That Geum Tae Woong didn't do something bad to him, right?

245
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:45,090
If he really ran away, there's no way he wouldn't contact me at all like this.

246
00:24:45,090 --> 00:24:47,760
He'd know I'd be worried about him.

247
00:24:49,670 --> 00:24:52,990
What do we do if he's in real trouble?

248
00:24:53,910 --> 00:24:56,220
You must be worried for him a lot.

249
00:24:57,370 --> 00:24:59,480
Isn't that obvious?

250
00:25:07,050 --> 00:25:08,840
Who is Sa Do Chan?

251
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:11,880
He'll be fine wherever he may be.

252
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:17,100
At first, I thought he was just a flighty scam artist.

253
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:23,040
That frivolous... I recently found out that he was just covering it up.

254
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:32,450
He got tangled up with me, became a prosecutor, and even got to go to jail.

255
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:39,110
Why is Sa Do Chan's life getting so tangled up? My heart aches for him.

256
00:25:40,410 --> 00:25:45,280
♫  Your two eyes which glow like the setting sun pass by  ♫

257
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:49,670

♫  Close your eyes  ♫

259
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:56,570

♫  It's you  ♫

264
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:19,780
 Sa Do Chan, he worked so hard for us all this time. 

265
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:22,820
 I guess you know that. I didn't think you knew. 

266
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:24,370
 Sa Do Chan! 

267
00:26:24,370 --> 00:26:26,190
 Do I look that easy? You're always doing that to me. 

268
00:26:26,190 --> 00:26:28,010
 You're the one who played around with me first!

00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:38,100
 Wait... 

273
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:40,140

Yes, Prosecutor Baek Joon Soo's office.

279
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:18,320
Yes.

280
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:21,800
You want to report something?

281
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:25,760
Yes.

282
00:27:30,990 --> 00:27:34,630
Prosecutor! Look at this!

283
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:53,700
I'm sure Sa Do Chan sent this video clip.

284
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:59,220
Then, that means Sa Do Chan set this up, huh?

285
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:02,260
Can we get Director Kim with this?

286
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:03,780
Yes.

287
00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:07,360
 So Ra 

288
00:28:09,430 --> 00:28:13,560
Reporter Oh So Ra, you want breaking news?

289
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:19,350
 Breaking news. There's a possibility that Sa Do Chan who escaped could have been murdered.
  

290
00:28:19,350 --> 00:28:22,170
 In this video clip that was delivered by an anonymous informant, 

291
00:28:22,170 --> 00:28:26,370
 a group of men who are chasing after Sa Do Chan has been recorded. 

292
00:28:26,370 --> 00:28:31,330
 Upon confirmation, we found out that they're employees the gallery owned by Mr. Geum 

293
00:28:31,330 --> 00:28:34,760
 who reported Sa Do Chan for attempting to murder him. This is sending quite a shock to everyone. 

294
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:38,370
