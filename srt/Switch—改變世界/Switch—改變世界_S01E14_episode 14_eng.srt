1
00:00:04,610 --> 00:00:06,470
Nice.

2
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:08,840
Good morn...

3
00:00:09,970 --> 00:00:16,970


4
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:25,050
Inspector, could you ask Prosecutor Oh what she's doing right now?

5
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:26,730
Sure.

6
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:33,140
Prosecutor Oh, Prosecutor Baek is asking me to ask you what you're doing right now.

7
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:37,320
Please tell him not to interrupt because I'm creating right now.

8
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:50,700
She said, "Please tell him not to interrupt because I'm creating right now."

9
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:58,960
What's that?

10
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:02,130
She says not to interrupt her because she's creating.

11
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:13,860
♫  The excitement that came in the wind  ♫

12
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:20,910
♫  That's how you blew my mind  ♫

13
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:23,380
♫  It was unfamiliar  ♫

14
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:27,500
Leave medication to a pharmacist and leave painting to a painter.

15
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:29,390
You think anybody can paint?

16
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:34,190
You have to figure out the subject and figure out a good composition.

17
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:36,560
Does it become a painting just because you get into it with a paint brush?

18
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:39,800
♫  Blow my mind.    ♫

19
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:44,580
Bad people should be handled by a bad person.
♫   A love which was a miracle to me.  ♫

20
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:50,950
♫   I don't know how my everything was so easily shaken.  ♫

21
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:53,300
I'm afraid you might get hurt, Prosecutor Oh.

22
00:01:55,810 --> 00:01:58,200
 I'm Prosecutor Oh. 

23
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:02,950
Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office.

24
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:06,230
Why did you come by to see me, Prosecutor?

25
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:19,640
- I painted it. 
 - Yes.

26
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:25,420
It's pretty good considering you're an amateur.

27
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:29,310
Then, would you sell my painting at a high price?

28
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:33,930
You're aware that President Hwang Beom Do of Dongyeong Mills

29
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:39,380
has  been arrested for breaking the law by producing and distributing drugs, right?

30
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:44,080
I'm sure he dealt with the drugs.

31
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:48,750
The really strange thing is that his storage is totally empty.

32
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:51,610
He spent all the money purchasing paintings.

33
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:56,780
They're rookie painters from Central and South America. They usually go for 1 million won if you're lucky.

34
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:59,960
But you had sold them for anywhere from 500 million won to 1 billion won.

35
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:02,970
There's no set price in art.

36
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:06,380
The purchaser decides subjectively looking at the future value.

37
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:09,720
Then also for my painting, subjectively and looking at its future value,

38
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,750
you should be able to buy it, right?

39
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:14,040
I'm not sure if a purchaser will appear.

40
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:19,120
But if you want, I'll purchase it myself for 5 billion won.

41
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:25,560
Tax evasion through art, money laundering, and even bribery.

42
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:28,300
I'm there, right?

43
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:30,450
I'm speaking of extreme exceptions.

44
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:33,670
If that exception takes place here, I guess it can be an issue.

45
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:36,250
If I have taken illegal profit through selling the painting,

46
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:40,290
please indict me or investigate me. I'll handle it.

47
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:46,980
And I understand that Hwang Beom Do's case is being investigated by the violent crimes division.

48
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:50,300
I don't think it's under the Criminal Investigation Division 6's jurisdiction?

49
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:55,050
You know very well how the prosecutors'office is operating.

50
00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:58,510
I used to be a detective, so I know that much.

51
00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:01,270
Ah. A detective.

52
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:25,380
Are you going to continue to leave this here?

53
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:28,950
I believe a person is born with a certain talent,

54
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:36,870
and I believe you should continue to work as a prosecutor.

55
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:41,610
And just because I said that it doesn't mean this painting is bad... Ah, my eyes!

56
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:44,940
I can't bear to look at it.

57
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:46,640
That's not what I mean.

58
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:49,580
What are you saying? There's someone who's willing to buy this for 5 billion won.

59
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:53,100
What kind of crazy guy would buy this for 5 billion won...

60
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:57,070
Who?

61
00:04:57,070 --> 00:04:58,740
Feel Gallery.

62
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:02,950
Feel Gallery? Geum Tae Woong.

63
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:05,640
You know him? I heard he used to be a detective.

64
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:08,470
Yes. I went there once.

65
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:12,230
I went there because I was told to find out if it was a suicide or murder.

66
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:13,600
You were told to find out?

67
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:18,780
Prosecutor Baek Joon Soo had asked me for a favor. Ah, I remember that time again.

68
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:24,330
Prosecutor Baek and I were eating together saying we're brothers and that this is a secret between us and stuff.

69
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:28,830
He asked me to look into it without your knowledge, Prosecutor Oh...

70
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:52,180
Prosecutor Oh, I'll make this request to you.

71
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:55,470
Please don't let Prosecutor Baek know about this.

72
00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:57,090
Okay.

73
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:09,090
Sunbae Baek asked you for a favor without my knowledge. And the fact that I got to find out,

74
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:12,470
let's keep that between us.

75
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:20,450
- Good job. 
 - Yes.

76
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:32,970
 Crime, Investigation Record 
 Suspect, Sa Ma Cheon (Deceased) 

77
00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:35,470
 Theft, Fraud, Fraud 

78
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:41,030
 Theft, Fraud, Fraud 

79
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:42,870
Fraud?

80
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:46,430
 What's your secret behind having become a such a great con artist? 

81
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:51,300
 Should I say the power of early education? 

82
00:06:55,930 --> 00:07:00,380
Sa Ma Cheon. It's highly probable that he's Sa Do Chan's father.

83
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:04,000
It shows that he committed suicide in 1998.

84
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,010
Suicide?

85
00:07:05,010 --> 00:07:10,950
I think Sa Do Chan is sure that his father was murdered.

86
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:17,110
I'm sure Sa Do Chan saw something in his childhood. Enough to be sure that he was murdered.

87
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:19,890
Is that why he's cooperating with us?

88
00:07:19,890 --> 00:07:23,400
We had the same goal. Brown Bear.

89
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:28,570
In summary, Sa Ma Cheon...

90
00:07:28,570 --> 00:07:31,180
His son, Sa Do Chan.

91
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:33,500
And Brown Bear.

92
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,040
These three are connected.

93
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:39,570
Sa Do Chan is sure that Brown Bear killed his father.

94
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:42,640
There's one more character.

95
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:46,020
Geum Tae Woong.

96
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:46,960
Geum Tae Woong?

97
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:52,370
The detective who was chasing Sa Ma Cheon at the time. The current CEO of Feel Gallery.

98
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:58,150
There is circumstantial evidence indicating  President Hwang's drug funds are being laundered through Geum Tae Woong's Feel Gallery.

99
00:07:58,150 --> 00:08:02,680
But the case has been handed over to the violent crimes division, so I can't investigate.

100
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:10,890
I don't know why, but Sa Do Chan is meeting Geum Tae Woong without my knowledge.

101
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:13,780
There's something between them.

102
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:24,550
 Brown Bear 

103
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:26,910
 Geum Tae Woong 

104
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:29,150
These aren't two people.

105
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,520
What if it's one person?

106
00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:51,060
♫  GO Don't stop, don't look back  ♫

107
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:54,000
♫  An obvious board game NO I'm not even starting  ♫

108
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,050
♫  A lie becomes the truth; the law is pretense becoming reality&nbsp;  ♫

109
00:08:57,050 --> 00:09:00,410
♫  You are provoking me again, You don't know me, what we got  ♫

110
00:09:00,410 --> 00:09:04,280
♫  Time which crosses the limit  ♫

111
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,610
He's making a right turn.

112
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:09,610
He's not going to the ossuary. The ossuary is in Chooncheon.

113
00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:13,250
He's going toward Ilsan. It's completely the opposite direction.

114
00:09:16,370 --> 00:09:18,520
Do Chan, let's forget about it and go home.

115
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:21,080
We're wasting gas.

116
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:24,900
Oppa, don't be too disappointed. You can't always be right.

117
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:29,710
April 4th was just any other day to Choi Jeong Pil.

118
00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:33,350
Right. It's also the day we failed.

119
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:38,120
As for me, I lose if I give up.

120
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:41,350
What's due today, we have to finish today.

121
00:10:17,210 --> 00:10:19,200
This is a Buddhist temple.

122
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,870
Hyung, follow him.

123
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:39,870
I came in through the front entrance, but everything is in Chinese characters.

124
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:42,280
I have no idea what it says.

125
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:44,360
Send me a video clip.

126
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:57,180
Yak Bo Jeon?

127
00:10:57,180 --> 00:11:00,970
Geuk, what? What do you do there?

128
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:04,140
A place where you console a dead person's spirit.

129
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:06,780
Then... a ritual?

130
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:09,750
Hyung, capture the inside.

131
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:17,400
Entrance is prohibited.

132
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:19,000
Okay.

133
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:42,200
I think they're coming out.

134
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,780
Hyung, check to see who it is.

135
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:11,990
Choi Mi Na.

136
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:30,110
That guy is...

137
00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:51,310
Do Chan.

138
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:58,820
Om-biro-gije-sabaha.  (x 3) 

139
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:03,660
 (This mantra is chanted while the deceased's name plate is burned at a Zen Buddhist  Memorial Ceremony.)  

140
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:07,970
 (This mantra takes away all of the deceased's karma and allows her to see the truth and act appropriately.) 

141
00:13:16,710 --> 00:13:19,360
Has it been 20 years this year?

142
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:25,670
Why do I have two rituals a year for a daughter who died before her own father?

143
00:13:26,650 --> 00:13:29,210
It's 20 years this year.

144
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:32,130
Let's stop now.

145
00:13:32,830 --> 00:13:38,050
I'll bury her in my heart now.

146
00:13:39,930 --> 00:13:42,310
Thank you for everything.

147
00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:46,100
Goodbye, Elder.

148
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:05,510
Not "Governor."

149
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:08,600
Not "Father-in-law."

150
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,450
Elder?

151
00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:42,370
 20 years ago, 1998 
 His name is Sa Ma Cheon.

152
00:14:42,370 --> 00:14:47,770
 Convicted three times for theft and fraud. He's an infamous con artist in this arena. 

153
00:14:47,770 --> 00:14:54,270
 This guy killed my daughter? 

154
00:14:57,900 --> 00:15:01,820
 He got caught when he broke into the villa to steal valuables. 

155
00:15:21,650 --> 00:15:25,530
 I think he ran away after stabbing her several times with a knife. 

156
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:50,300
 Sa Ma Cheon's fingerprints were found on the knife. 

157
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:55,580
 I'll place him on the wanted list. 

158

 The election is right around the corner. 

159
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:02,810
 We can't give them a motivation to take me down. 

160

 Be sure to stop the press.

 And you and I are the only ones who know about Mi Na's death.

 Do you understand? 

163
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:20,970
 Are you saying to bury everything this way? 

164
00:16:20,970 --> 00:16:25,080
 No way. You catch him. 

165
00:16:25,830 --> 00:16:29,330
 Cut his head off! 

166
00:16:29,330 --> 00:16:31,140
 And bring it here. 

167
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:32,690
 Okay. 

168
00:16:41,690 --> 00:16:43,470
 Wait. 

169
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:56,140
 This day, here. It's the day my Mi Na was helping her father out with his campaign 

170
00:16:58,050 --> 00:17:01,230
 and died in a car accident. 

171

No, ma'am.

Go home and get some rest. Your family will get worried.

Didn't you say last time that you have a son?
