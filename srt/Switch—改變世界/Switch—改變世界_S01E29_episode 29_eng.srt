1
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:17,730
Yes.

2
00:01:18,850 --> 00:01:21,160
You want to report something?

3
00:01:22,990 --> 00:01:24,650
Yes.

4
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:33,320
Prosecutor! Look at this!

5
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:49,970
I'm sure Sa Do Chan sent this video clip.

6
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:55,180
Then, that means Sa Do Chan set this up, huh?

7
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:58,280
Can we get Director Kim with this?

8
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,710
Yeah.

9
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:03,220
 Sso 

10
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:09,370
Reporter Oh So Ra, you want some breaking news?

11
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:15,000
 Breaking news. Escapee Sa Do Chan may been murdered.  
   

12
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,900
 In this video clip that was delivered by an anonymous informant, 

13
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:22,100
 a group of men who are chasing after Sa Do Chan has been recorded. 

14
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:28,000
 Upon confirmation, we found out that they're employees at the gallery of Mr. Geum 

15
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,510
 who reported Sa Do Chan for attempting to murder him. This is sending quite a shock to everyone. 

16
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:34,090
 SBC News. This is Oh So Ra. 

17
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:38,610
Director Kim, you a**hole! How did you take care things?

18
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:43,260
We're from the Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office.

19
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:50,720
Kim Hyeon Wook, you're under immediate arrest for special assault.

20
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:56,650
CEO.

21
00:02:56,650 --> 00:03:01,990
Director Kim. What are they talking about?

22
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:04,920
What did you do?

23
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:09,810
You're next, Geum Tae Woong.

24
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:51,680
Sa Do Chan didn't escape. This was his plot.

25
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:57,980
It was his bait to deceive me again and get Director Kim!

26
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:08,390
Call the general affairs department and tell them to destroy all paperwork on Director Kim and his expenses.

27
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:12,830
Tell the security team to erase all the CCTV that was recorded for the last month.

28
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:16,690
Erase all the traces of him going in and out of this gallery!

29
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:21,830
Baek Joon Soo and Sa Do Chan.

30
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:26,050
These two bastards played another trick on me.

31
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:41,480
In Tae, good job.

32
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:45,780
Your reporting time was perfect and the video clip played well.

33
00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:52,050
We arrested Director Kim. It's only a matter of time at this point.

34
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:55,820
Okay. Good job.

35
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:46,270
Kim Hyeon Wook, you tried to murder Sa Do Chan, right?

36
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:49,790
Why did you try to kill him?

37
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:54,880
Geum Tae Woong told you to kill Sa Do Chan, right?

38
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:02,070
Attempted murder of Prosecutor Baek Joon Soo.

39
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,050
Murder of diplomat Park Yeong Jin in prison.

40
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:07,890
Camouflaging Nam Seung Tae's death on Bookhansan as a suicide.

41
00:06:07,890 --> 00:06:10,530
Murder of K-Savings Bank manager.

42
00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:12,750
Victor in Incheon port storage.

43
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:15,690
And murder of Sa Ma Cheon.

44
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:22,490
If you committed all these crimes on your own, you'll get either life in prison or a death sentence.

45
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:26,490
If you confess that you were ordered to do it by Geum Tae Woong, you'll get 20 years.

46
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:30,820
If you cooperate with our investigation, it's possible to get a lesser sentence.

47
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:32,970
Make your choice.

48
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:41,190
Geum Tae Woong ordered all these things, right?

49
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:47,780
I'll plead the 5th. Please call an attorney.

50
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:03,430
You're working hard.

51
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:09,110
Who gave away the video clip to the news?

52
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:11,300
I heard a hiker recorded it coming down the mountain.

53
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:12,890
Oh, yeah?

54
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:18,390
I'm glad Sa Do Chan didn't die.

55
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:20,380
Is he talking?

56
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:22,970
He's pleading the 5th.

57
00:07:22,970 --> 00:07:25,580
He's afraid of Geum Tae Woong.

58
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:30,380
You summoned Geum Tae Woong, right? Tell him to come and get his interrogation as a reference witness.

59
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:35,920
I contacted him, but through his lawyer he said he can't come due to his health condition.

60
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:38,380
What a sneaky person.

61
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:44,680
In any case, I have never seen a person in Korea who respects the prosecutor's office when they have power.

62
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:50,790
Prosecutor Baek. This must be an opportunity to arrest Geum Tae Woong.

63
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:54,730
The first step to do that is that Director Kim.

64
00:07:54,730 --> 00:07:58,570
I'm sure he's the one who arranged

65
00:07:58,570 --> 00:08:01,500
the car accident you got into on your way up from Sokcho.

66
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:04,320
Geum Tae Woong told him to, I'm sure.

67
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:06,830
Yeah.

68
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:08,710
Prosecutor Baek.

69
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:13,530
Make sure you get him to talk.

70
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:14,610
Okay.

71
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:20,660
Let's not give up until it's all over. Let's get Geum Tae Woong with our prosecutor careers on the line.

72
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:25,150
I'm putting my entire life on the line.

73
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:35,520
 Switch 

74
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:40,010
 15
 A waterfall creates a torrent. 

75
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:43,490
 Feel Gallery, Geum Tae Woong 

76
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:49,440
Among these, let's trace back to the cases from which we can obtain clear evidence.

77
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:52,220
Shouldn't we start off with Sa Ma Cheon's murder case?

78
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:58,020
That case, Sa Do Chan will testify for clearly when he comes back.

79
00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:02,050
That's right, since Sa Do Chan was at the scene.

80
00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:06,740
It's a relief that Sa Do Chan clearly eluded Director Kim.

81
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:10,210
How could he have escaped?

82
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:15,510
He had to survive. That was his only way to survive.

83
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:23,310
I'll find Sa Do Chan and make him testify.

84
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:46,880
Sa Do Chan?

85
00:09:49,090 --> 00:09:53,140
You sure do look like our Prosecutor Baek.

86
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:55,180
I'm sorry to have deceived you.

87
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:58,690
No, I fell for it.

88
00:09:58,690 --> 00:10:01,980
But why did you ask me to come here?

89
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:06,140
Prosecutor Baek is trying to die in my place.

90
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:11,050
Prosecutor Baek is trying to die?

91
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,420
So, you'll have to help me, Inspector Go.

92
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:20,020
I have to save Prosecutor Baek.

93
00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:36,980
Prosecutor Baek.

94
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:41,400
Just call me Do Chan.

95
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:45,690
I've been hesitating, too.

96
00:10:45,690 --> 00:10:52,780
Prosecutor Baek, no. Because I believed Sa Do Chan's plan was a right plan,

97
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:55,110
that's why I made up my mind and did it.

98
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:57,480
It's about saving a life.

99
00:10:58,090 --> 00:10:59,880
Thank you.

100
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:05,210
You're the only one who knows my identity inside the Prosecutors' Office.

101
00:11:05,210 --> 00:11:09,100
Even Prosecutor Oh Ha Ra thinks I'm Prosecutor Baek Joon Soo.

102
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:14,870
If we're not careful, you can be in danger as well.

103
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:16,160
Will you be okay with that?

104
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:22,120
I may look sharp on the outside, but my brain is quite simple.

105
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:26,440
From this moment, the person in front of me is

106
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:30,240
the one and only Prosecutor Baek Joon Soo.

107
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,510
 Smell of alchohol! 

108
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:52,500
Did you drink?

109
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:55,730
You're working so hard.

110
00:11:55,730 --> 00:12:00,430
A half conman, half prosecutor. It's not like you're a fried chicken that's half spicy and half soy sauce base.

111
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:04,360
Did Director Kim start talking yet?

112
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:08,330
How can we make him talk?

113
00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:12,250
I'm sure Geum Tae Woong has a tight grip on him, so that he can't say anything.

114
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:15,990
Prosecutor Oh will be in charge of Director Kim.

115
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:19,630
We just have to contact that guy.

116
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:20,540
Who?

117
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:24,740
Who else? That Jo Seong Doo bastard.

118
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:29,580
When we get him this time, I'll beat him up.

119
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:38,510
Okay. Shall we set this up for the first time in a long time?

120
00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:41,010
It's a setting!

121
00:13:07,210 --> 00:13:10,130
- What, what, what? 
 - Hi, Bang Bang Wo.

122
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:21,380
For the crime of bothering people and acting like a thug!

123
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:26,550
Trying to kill people by manipulating their kindness.

124
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:28,840
Please ... Please let me go.

125
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:31,400
Should we dump him in the ocean?

126
00:13:37,290 --> 00:13:41,070
I'm... I'm so sorry. I'll never do that again. I was wrong.

127
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:44,040
No!

128
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:55,480
What the heck?

129
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:58,920
I... I... I'm dead.

130
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:12,380
I want to beat you to death, but I'm letting you live because of Hyung Do Chan.

131
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:19,140
We can kill you and let you live seven times over.

132
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:20,800
If you try to play tricks once more—

133
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,060
Wait!

134
00:14:29,690 --> 00:14:33,490
There's one thing I must do before I die.

135
00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:35,610
What is that?

136
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:45,290
There's a guy I'd like to drag to the afterlife and make him kneel in front of my mom.

137
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:50,960
Follow me.

138
00:14:56,780 --> 00:15:00,690
You want to take revenge on Geum Tae Woong?

139
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:08,590
Just watch me. I'll make sure he cries bloody tears.

140
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,590
Even though he's your father?

141
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:17,700
How did you know that?

142
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:25,080
You have to be cold to take revenge. You can't do anything if your heart beats first.

143
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:27,080
You'll only make mistakes.

144
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:31,280
Please tell me what to do.

145
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:42,240
That Sa Do Chan's escape drama,

146
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:45,740
Prosecutor Baek and Oh Ha Ra were in on it.

147
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:50,510
What are you talking about? Do you have evidence?

148
00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:53,100
Isn't that why the Board of Audit and Inspection is there? ( National organization auditing all government offices 

149
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:56,090
Utilize the Inspection Headquarters  of the Supreme Prosecutors' Office.

150
00:15:56,090 --> 00:15:58,370
The Inspection Headquarters? ( Investigates and disciplines irregularities committed by  prosecutors). 

151
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:05,110
If you conduct an internal investigation on Prosecutors Baek Joon Soo and Oh Ha Ra secretly,

152
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:10,320
you'll be able to reveal who pretended to be a prosecutor.

153
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:14,240
And what if... of all things...

154
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:17,980
if that turns out to be true, how would I deal with it then?

155
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:20,520
Give it an impersonation charge

156
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:23,590
so that I can find a way to survive this.

157
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:31,920
A con artist and a prosecutor were in cahoots.

158
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:36,480
Baek Joon Soo was fake and even Prosecutor Oh Ha Ra,

159
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:40,180
if she was in on it...

160
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:45,670
Fruit of the poisonous tree.

161
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:47,490
 Fruit of the poisonous tree theory: Illegally obtained evidence can't be used in court 

162
00:16:47,490 --> 00:16:51,490
Fruit of the poisonous tree.

163
00:17:02,370 --> 00:17:05,640
  Supreme Prosecutors' Office Inspection Department 

164
00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:17,020
 Prosecutors' Office 

165
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:26,550
Did you kill Nam Seung Tae who supposedly committed suicide in Bookhansan?

166
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:40,310
We discovered evidence that shows that the vehicle you used for the crime entered and exited Bookhansan that day.

167
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:44,710
Kim Hyeong Wook, you won't have too many chances.

168
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:49,870
If you don't tell me who ordered the murder, you'll get life in prison.

169
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:55,870
It's no use regretting it later. Make the right choice.

170
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:17,280
Go to jail and see Director Kim.

171
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:20,790
Yes, sir. What should I tell him?

172
00:18:20,790 --> 00:18:27,420
He is a man of few words, but it's about time he'll start to waver. Make sure he keeps quiet.

173
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:29,230
How?

174
00:18:29,230 --> 00:18:32,910
His mother lives in Busan, Haewoondae.

175
00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:36,870
Tell him I purchased her an apartment worth two-billion won.

176
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:41,640
He'd know what I mean then. Go.

177
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:44,690
And...

178
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:51,360
Without Director Kim, you take his place from now on.

179
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:55,380
Okay. Thank you for trusting me.

180
00:18:56,160 --> 00:19:02,520
I'll be sure to repay your generosity.

181
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,710
Go.

182
00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:39,510
I can't call you "Father" no matter what.

183
00:19:48,090 --> 00:19:50,390
 Sa Do Chan 

184
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:58,450
This is Seong Doo. I'm going to meet Director Kim. What should I do?

185
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:06,140
Director Kim, you're going through so much.

186
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:14,240
CEO says he's going to buy your mother an apartment in Haewoondae.

187
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:18,280
He told me to tell you this.

188
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:26,850
Mr. Jo. What is your relationship with CEO Geum Tae Woong?

189
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:28,120
What relationship?

190
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:31,030
I've been suspicious.

191
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:35,070
Aren't you his son?

192
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:45,690
You know it well. How did you find out?

193
00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:49,580
As expected.

194
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:53,260
Ah.

195
00:20:54,370 --> 00:20:59,520
Geum Tae Woong. I'm the son of that SOB.

196
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:03,040
What are you saying?

197
00:21:08,650 --> 00:21:10,810
So, I want to say...

198
00:21:28,490 --> 00:21:30,670
Why isn't Geum Tae Woong calling us?

199
00:21:30,670 --> 00:21:35,000
With the arrest of Director Kim, he's catching his breath (being cautious).

200
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:39,450
What if the international attorney setting goes wrong?

201
00:21:39,450 --> 00:21:42,180
We can't have Geum Tae Woong be too suspicious.

202
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:43,550
Just wait.

203
00:21:43,550 --> 00:21:47,770
The more Do Chan moves around, the more Geum Tae Woong will become anxious and rush.

204
00:21:47,770 --> 00:21:51,650
Just watch. He'll call before I can finish counting to five.

205
00:21:51,650 --> 00:21:54,270
 Geum Tae Woong 

206
00:21:54,270 --> 00:21:56,080
See?

207
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,010
Wait! Mind control.

208
00:22:01,010 --> 00:22:03,810
You're an international attorney Park Hyeok from now on.

209
00:22:03,810 --> 00:22:06,580
I'm the international attorney Park Hyeok.

210
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:13,290
Yes, I'm Attorney Park Hyeok.

211
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:17,210
Yes. I'll see you tomorrow.

212
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:26,900
Geum Tae Woong wants to see me tomorrow. He wants me to make a presentation on how I'll launder his funds.

213
00:22:28,570 --> 00:22:31,020
I'm scared of Geum Tae Woong.

214
00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:38,810
First, WK Trading company will

215
00:22:38,810 --> 00:22:41,460
export vintage vehicles to Liechtenstein.

216
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:45,630
Then, I'll receive assistance from an international attorney there.

217
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:49,390
Through the Panama Law Firm who is known to be the best in this field,

218
00:22:49,390 --> 00:22:52,620
I will create ten paper companies.

219
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:56,340
And I'll switch them around several times in Liechtenstein.

220
00:22:56,340 --> 00:23:00,250
Through 10 different accounts, each will send 20 billion won to WK Trading Company.

221
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:04,800
Then, a total of 200 billion won will come into Korea.

222
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:10,910
After that, these paper companies will close down due to lack of profitability.

223
00:23:10,910 --> 00:23:13,680
It's the most important final step to take.

224
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:19,850
President Jo Seong Doo of WK Trading Company runs to the casino with the 200 billion won.

225
00:23:21,450 --> 00:23:22,780
What did you say?

226
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:25,260
So that you can avoid having the funds traced.

227
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:29,210
Pay the fee to the casino and get laundered cash from the casino.

228
00:23:29,210 --> 00:23:32,980
I'm sure there are several people who'd do that for you in secret at Gangseon Land.

229
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:35,330
You make the contact on that task.

230
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:39,320
Bring the cash in from the site?

231
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:46,820
Yes. You'd have to prepare a moving-service truck at least to move 200 billion in cash.

232
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:09,800
 Are you going to take her, too? 

233
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:13,530
 I'm just worried it will break during transport. 

234
00:24:50,310 --> 00:24:52,670
Go Gi Bong, this is yours, right?

235
00:24:52,670 --> 00:24:55,930
No, no. I can't drink juice because of my stomach acid.

236
00:24:55,930 --> 00:24:59,370
I can tell right away that you drank this. If you did, be sure to clean up after yourself.

237
00:24:59,370 --> 00:25:01,750
Okay, I'll throw it away.

238
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:06,000
Sunbae, do you have something to say?

239
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,410
Oh Ha Ra, you can't do this as a prosecutor.

240
00:25:09,410 --> 00:25:14,430
You jumped over the turnstile without showing your identity. Aren't you a prosecutor?

241
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:19,540
No matter how foolish you are, you still need to follow the basic rules.

242
00:25:19,540 --> 00:25:21,990
Did you come in here to say that?

243
00:25:21,990 --> 00:25:26,150
What do you mean? I meant to tell you this before, but I forgot. That's why I came.

244
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:29,380
I heard you took that necklace away from someone, too.

245
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:32,240
Give it back to the owner.

246
00:25:33,050 --> 00:25:39,080
As people say, "one can represent tens of cases," you have no basic manners.

247
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:46,040
He's picking a fight with me, right?

248
00:25:51,230 --> 00:25:55,600
He must think I'm easy to pick on. He's like that whenever he sees me.

249
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,600
He is picking on me for nothing.

250
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:06,200
Gil Dae Ro, he's so annoying. I completely lose my appetite for rice whenever I think of that moron.

251
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:09,850
Are you sure you lost your appetite? You're enjoying your food.

252
00:26:09,850 --> 00:26:13,100
This is pizza, not rice. That's why.

253
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:16,920
Who cares if he's my sunbae? Why pick on my necklace?

254
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:21,540
Prosecutor Oh, why don't you give that necklace back to its owner?

255
00:26:23,830 --> 00:26:24,580
Sunbae.

256
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:27,780
I'll buy you a new one. Return it.

257
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:37,150
I took this away from that woman.

258
00:26:40,850 --> 00:26:43,350
Pretty Mi Ran.

259
00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:47,390
Pretty Mi Ran? Why would you take away what's Mi Ran's?

260
00:26:50,290 --> 00:26:52,200
Wait.

261
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:09,460
He's not Sunbae Baek.

262
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:14,750
Sa Do Chan. How could he be here?

263
00:27:33,150 --> 00:27:35,240
Shall we go somewhere?

264
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:37,180
Where?

265
00:27:37,180 --> 00:27:39,350
To see Sunbae.

266
00:27:40,590 --> 00:27:43,920
Sunbae Baek, where did you hide him?

267
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:46,120
Sa Do Chan.

268
00:27:57,610 --> 00:28:02,220
Tell me. Why did you pretend to be Sunbae Baek even deceiving me?

269
00:28:04,270 --> 00:28:06,010
I said tell me.

270
00:28:06,010 --> 00:28:08,350
Prosecutor Baek pleaded with me.

271
00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:12,540
He said you'd worry. That's why I kept it a secret.

272
00:28:13,630 --> 00:28:18,410
Prosecutor Baek, I think he had made up his mind from the day he arrested me.

273
00:28:18,410 --> 00:28:21,810
He wants to kill Geum Tae Woong as Sa Do Chan.

274
00:28:21,810 --> 00:28:26,660
 I will die as the con man Sa Do Chan. 

275
00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:31,670
 Prosecutor Baek was going to switch with me creating an escape setting. 

276
00:28:31,670 --> 00:28:33,680
 He prepared for his death, 

277
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:37,590
 so that I could continue the investigation in his place. 

278
00:28:38,850 --> 00:28:41,190
 That's why I took one more step. 

279
00:28:41,190 --> 00:28:46,740
 I asked my team to let me know when Prosecutor Baek begins his plan. 

280
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:50,950
 So, we took him away from Director Kim before it got too dangerous. 

281
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:54,150
Even if he knows he is going to die,

282
00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:57,450
he has to live as long as he  can.

283
00:28:57,450 --> 00:29:01,180
That's why I isolated him from the outer world.

284
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:05,860
Get your car right now. I have to go check.

285
00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:08,770
Prosecutor Oh!

286
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:34,600
♫  You are in my eyes which got red like a sunset  (meaning: I can see you through my crying eyes)♫

287
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:43,810
♫  Close my eyes and lean on your warmth and fall asleep  ♫

288
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:53,990
♫  The lighthouse which stands alone in the dream  ♫

289
00:29:55,080 --> 00:30:02,390
♫  only looks at me who am lost  ♫

290
00:30:02,390 --> 00:30:05,150
♫  &nbsp;It's you (the lighthouse), raise me up  ♫

291
00:30:05,150 --> 00:30:07,750
How is his condition?

292
00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:11,650
The patient arrived too late.

293
00:30:11,650 --> 00:30:15,210
I can't guarantee anything at this point.

294
00:30:15,210 --> 00:30:17,440
♫  Stay with me  ♫

295
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:21,530
But I'll do my best to revive him.

296
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:25,430
♫  At my side  ♫

297
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:43,770
