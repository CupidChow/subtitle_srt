1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:02,670
I'll take care of Deputy Prosecutor Woo. You escape to the stairwell.

2
00:00:02,670 --> 00:00:04,170
All right.

3
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:12,220


4
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:18,490
Baek Joon Soo! How long has it been!

5
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:25,180
Yes, Deputy Prosecutor. Why are you using the stairs?

6
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:27,720
I'm getting a belly. So, to exercise.

7
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:30,380
Where are you going? Didn't you receive a call?

8
00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:35,170
I thought you might come this way. I came to welcome you.

9
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:36,010
Let's go.

10
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:38,430
You're much less timid.

11
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:47,180
It's been awhile. How about it? Should we go there?

12
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:52,950
Yes, let's go. I haven't played golf lately.

13
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:58,000
What are you saying? The fishing hole in Gangwhado.

14
00:00:58,870 --> 00:01:01,780
President Kang still swears a lot, huh?

15
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:05,410
Well? I haven't gone fishing at all lately.

16
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:11,750
The ahjumma at the convenience store.

17
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:13,110
Ah yes...

18
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:16,280
Do you already have dementia at your young age?

19
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:32,750
You've come?

20
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:34,450
Hi, Prosecutor Oh.

21
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,670
I don't think I'd recognize you if I ran into you walking down the street.

22
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,240
Deputy Prosecutor, seriously, I don't look that ordinary.

23
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:49,180
I know.

24
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:56,700
Joon Soo. You know, I wish you'd live an ordinary life like other people.

25
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:01,370
Yes... well, what do you mean by that?

26
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:05,890
I'm telling you to live a long and less serious life. Be flexible

27
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:11,800
so that you won't be scarred, and you'll get to work as a prosecutor which you enjoy so much for a long, long time.

28
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:20,250
Yes, Deputy Prosecutor. Please don't worry.

29
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:21,930
I've changed a lot.

30
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:26,450
I will live quietly and won't cause problems in the future.

31
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,590
You've changed a lot in the time I haven't seen you.

32
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:35,930
People are bound to change.

33
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:45,150
Oh, Deputy Prosecutor Woo!

34
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:47,140
Scared me. Deputy Prosecutor Yang.

35
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:48,820
Did I scare you a lot?

36
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:49,850
Yeah, I did.

37
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:52,210
You should've come to my office first if you are visiting. Let's go.

38
00:02:52,210 --> 00:02:53,730
Huh? I'm in the middle of a conversation.

39
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:55,800
It's okay. Let's go.

40
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,650
Ah, geez.

41
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:06,720
But... Baek Joon Soo seems to have changed.

42
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,100
What could he have become?

43
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:11,280
Well... I don't know either.

44
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:15,960
what changed about him, but he did change

45
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:18,990
Well, well, well... let's go.

46
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:20,750
Is it because of you?

47
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:22,300
Is it because of me?

48
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:27,860
Are you out of your mind? You're crazy. Crazy, crazy! How can you cross your legs in front of your mentor?

49
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:31,240
Wait, what a premodern and old men's tradition!

50
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,660
You said he's close to Baek Joon Soo.

51
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:35,250
Let's be cautious, okay?

52
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:38,620
Every time you open your mouth, you say, "Sunbae Baek wasn't like that, Sunbae Baek did that..."

53
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:41,300
It's not like I'm going to live out Baek Joon Soo's life forever.

54
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:44,340
That's right. Did I say you have to live as him forever? Once we get the item from Nam Seung Tae—

55
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:47,250
I'll leave the Prosecutors' Office without even looking back.

56
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:48,350
That's what I want.

57
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:50,820
We'll never see each other again then.

58
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:54,170
That's what I said. Let's never see each other.

59
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:13,550
I don't usually do crappy stuff like this.

60
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:17,620
This is all because of that Prosecutor Baek.

61
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:27,410
But why were you going to give the information to that prosecutor bastard?

62
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:33,590
Because, Baek Joon Soo, he's the only prosecutor who is trustworthy.

63
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:38,310
He is? For what?

64
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:40,590
He's cautious.

65
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:43,440
- That thug? 
 - He doesn't say much.

66
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:47,410
- He's extremely noisy. 
 - And he looks trustworthy.

67
00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:49,870
Doesn't he look like a scammer?

68
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:56,370
You really don't have a good eye to discern people. Look at me. Look.

69
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:01,540
A face like this is a trustworthy one.

70
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:05,500
Are you scoffing? Wanna die?

71
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:06,440
Um...

72
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:08,820
What now?

73
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:11,200
Let me use the bathroom.

74
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:15,270
Pee into this can.

75
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:18,410
I feel like diarrhea.

76
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:45,340
This a**hole!

77
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:06,600
How dare you stab me in the back?

78
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:10,360
Stay still... still!

79
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:21,590
Isn't it nice when you listen to me?

80
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:26,330
Stand up. Stand up.

81
00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:43,670
Oh, no.

82
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:48,080
He died.

83
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:52,620
What do I do?

84
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:02,600
He says to come in.

85
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:07,630
Is he very upset? He's very upset, huh?

86
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:10,350
Of course. I'm so unlucky!

87
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:12,580
Did I know that he'd die so easily like that?

88
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:17,270
Director Kim, please help me. Say something nice to the CEO.

89
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:21,140
I don't know why the Chairman keeps you around despite all your mistakes.

90
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:23,450
You should be ready this time though.

91
00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:53,950
CEO! Please forgive me!

92
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:57,620
There's a small tangerine farm in Jeju Island.

93
00:07:57,620 --> 00:08:02,780
Take a break somewhere with fresh air. How about you manage the farm?

94
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:05,980
CEO! Please don't abandon me!

95
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:09,930
Please forgive me! I did wrong.

96
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:11,660
CEO!

97
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,680
CEO! My hand... please...

98
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:37,140
Seong Do, do you know why human beings are different from animals?

99
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:41,780
People have regrets.

100
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:46,740
There are two types of regrets. One where you've done something and regret.

101
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:50,430
Another type of regret you have because you didn't do something.

102
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:55,150
As for me, if I don't kick you out this time

103
00:08:55,830 --> 00:08:59,180
I feel like I'm going to regret that for sure.

104
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:01,060
Please let me live.

105
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:05,030
I won't let you regret this. Just this once.

106
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:09,360
Think of my dead mother...

107
00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:11,850
My mother.

108
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:40,540
What can I do? I started it...

109
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:53,000
 International Ferry Terminal 

110
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:05,170
Joon Seo-ya!

111
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:12,800
Help me. Help me.

112
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,360
- Help me...
 - Ma'am!

113
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,060
Are you okay?

114
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:19,890
Mommy...

115
00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:21,070
Hold on...

116
00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:23,230
Hold on, please.

117
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:28,840
Step back please!

118
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:33,450
- I'm back. 
 - Hello.

119
00:10:33,450 --> 00:10:35,480
Wow, these bastards.

120
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:38,550
How could they put drugs inside a pregnant woman¿

121
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:44,280
This drug is a new drug called LSDT that was developed in Columbia.

122
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:46,350
LSDT?

123
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:55,630
 Chief Prosecutor Jeong Do Yeong 

124
00:10:56,610 --> 00:10:59,160
They're vicious.

125
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:02,440
To come up with the idea of using a pregnant woman as a mule. 
  mule: person transporting drugs/items for someone else 

126
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,690
We must investigate this thoroughly.

127
00:11:04,690 --> 00:11:08,960
And I was thinking Criminal Investigation Division 6, you take this case.

128
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,370
Pardon?

129
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:13,830
Isn't drug enforcement under Violent Crime Division?

130
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:17,240
Isn't this the case that Baek Joon Soo worked on last year?

131
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,580
Yes, that's...

132
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:22,670
Give it to Prosecutor Baek. Someone who worked on it once before must do well.

133
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:25,740
Yes, sir. I understand. Yes.

134
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:38,680
The chief prosecutor insists that I assign this case to Prosecutor Baek.

135
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:40,600
That's great.

136
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,770
I'll take this.

137
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,300
LSDT.

138
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:48,700
Sunbae Baek was investigating it.

139
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:55,720
They fed her this.

140
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,920
The liquid from the drug burst in her stomach

141
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:01,210
and was absorbed into her blood. That's why she was in a state of shock.

142
00:12:01,210 --> 00:12:03,870
Then as for the baby...

143
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:20,360


144
00:12:27,090 --> 00:12:32,150
Ahjussi, is my mom going to die?

145
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:34,000
No. Who says that?

146
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,370
The doctor.

147
00:12:37,370 --> 00:12:41,730
Well, I'm not a doctor, but a prosecutor.

148
00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:43,350
A prosecutor?

149
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:46,710
Yeah. It's a really boring job.

150
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:49,570
Don't you ever think about becoming a prosecutor when you grow up.

151
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:53,420
I heard that prosecutors catch bad guys.

152
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:58,510
My mom said that. Then, you can catch them, huh, Ahjussi?

153
00:12:58,510 --> 00:13:01,810
The guy who hurt my mom...

154
00:13:01,810 --> 00:13:05,050
Hey, I want to do that right away when I think of you.

155
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:09,790
But you know, considering the circumstances, to catch those guys...

156
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:12,130
Should I say I'm not quite ready,

157
00:13:12,130 --> 00:13:14,310
or should I say my qualifications are not good enough?

158
00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:15,660
Anyway,

159
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:20,340
I want to say that there's a huge difference between  what I want to do and what I can do.

160
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:21,870
But no matter what happens,

161
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:24,090
don't be discouraged. If you have hope—

162
00:13:24,090 --> 00:13:29,030
I don't understand what you're saying.

163
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:31,100
Sorry.

164
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:34,280
I get to work with several types of people due to my work.

165
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:38,970
Please catch the bad guys for sure!

166
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,100
Kid, I feel for you.

167
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:48,800
Hey, I have a habit of keeping my promise.

168
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:55,340
My mom gave me this. I'll give it to you, Ahjussi.

169
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:58,150
Be sure to catch them.

170
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:04,890
Nana Club?

171
00:14:04,890 --> 00:14:07,180
What did you two talk about?

172
00:14:08,170 --> 00:14:09,760
You got close to him fast.

173
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:13,460
Kids recognize sincere people.

174
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:17,300
You didn't lie that you'd catch the suspect?

175
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:19,780
My job is to lie.

176
00:14:22,330 --> 00:14:26,200
Those bastards. We should catch them, huh?

177
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,010
We must.

178
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:33,540
But in drug-related cases, it takes some time for us to get close to the main culprit.

179
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:38,580
because usually the errand-runners who are at the bottom of the crime chain get arrested.

180
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:41,810
They don't even know for whom they really work.

181
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:46,500
Don't even think about doing something else.

182
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:49,560
Am I a prosecutor or something? For me to catch a suspect?

183
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:05,110
 Courtward 

184
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:17,800
 Bul Bo, don't do this... 

185
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:20,520
 Bul Bo, please... 

186
00:15:34,590 --> 00:15:36,270
Do Chan.

187
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:42,150
Did you have that dream again?

188
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:45,640
You have a jinx.

189
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:49,460
Things don't work out smoothly when you have that dream.

190
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:51,540
Let's postpone our job planned for today.

191
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:09,400
You're spinning that again?

192
00:16:10,330 --> 00:16:12,520
What's this?

193
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:14,070
Just you know...

194
00:16:14,070 --> 00:16:16,740
When I'm bored, when I'm thinking.

195
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:19,340
It looks just like someone spinning his wheels.

196
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:21,130
Without working.

197
00:16:22,630 --> 00:16:24,530
I'm not a real prosecutor.

198
00:16:24,530 --> 00:16:27,040
Am I conducting an investigation or do I sign documents?

199
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,230
I just have to kill time. Right?

200
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:33,870
Well, I guess I'm envious of you since I've had so much work to do.

201
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:38,590
My head hurts.

202
00:16:38,590 --> 00:16:42,630
May I lay my hand on the sacred investigation file?

203
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:52,280
Oh, this is worth considering extenuation.

204
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:54,150
How about choosing the punishment first and mitigating the sentence or penalty afterward?

205
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:56,890
Do you even know the term mitigation of punishment in extenuation of circumstances?

206
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:59,950
When there are multiple punishment options  available for a crime,

207
00:16:59,950 --> 00:17:02,130
you choose what punishment you will give first, (either fine or prison time),

208
00:17:02,130 --> 00:17:04,750
and then, you reduce that amount for decided punishment. Criminal Act Article 54.

209
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:08,250
Boy, you can't just know this.

210
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:12,480
You were a law student, huh? You studied for the bar, huh?

211
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:18,070
You're asking a prosecutor, "You were a law student? You studied for the bar?"

212
00:17:18,070 --> 00:17:21,130
What? Is this the latest comedy?

213
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:30,260
Gosh! My stupid mouth!

214
00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:00,190
All right then. Prosecutor Oh, I'll get going.

215
00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:05,110
- You'll get going? 
 - I have an appointment. I have to go first.

216
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,890
You have to meet Nam Seung Tae tomorrow. So, don't get yourself in trouble. Wait and let's take off together.

217
00:18:12,670 --> 00:18:15,040
I'm so tired.

218
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:18,440
Let me take a quick nap in the nap room.

219
00:18:28,610 --> 00:18:32,960
 Nana Club 

220
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:41,130
Hey! You a**hole!

221
00:18:41,130 --> 00:18:44,430
You said we should live together. You said you'll marry me.

222
00:18:44,430 --> 00:18:46,310
This is so annoying.

223
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:48,130
And now you tell me to get an abortion?

224
00:18:48,130 --> 00:18:50,770
Where's the money to raise a kid?

225
00:18:50,770 --> 00:18:52,980
You can sell that.

226
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:56,980
You crazy? Crazy? This is like my own child.

227
00:18:56,980 --> 00:19:00,730
Then how about what's in my tummy? Isn't it your baby?

228
00:19:00,730 --> 00:19:03,500
Whatever. Whatever. Get lost.

229
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:06,040
You a**hole!

230
00:19:07,690 --> 00:19:09,750
What are you looking at?

231
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:11,570
How could a man do that...

232
00:19:11,570 --> 00:19:12,420
So bad...

233
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:14,970
What a jerk...

234
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:18,230
Seriously...

235
00:19:18,970 --> 00:19:22,030
Oy, pregnant lady.

236
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:29,760
This ahjussi says he'll introduce you to a job that makes money. I'll do whatever you tell me to do, Oppa.

237
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:42,860
Looks like you need money.

238
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:48,310
If you can convince your woman, I'll let you make some big bucks.

239
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:50,660
What is it?

240
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:57,280
 Asia Frozen Goods Distribution 

241
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,890
 It's not a big deal. 

242
00:20:03,730 --> 00:20:07,050
You're taking too much time. I'm busy, you know.

243
00:20:07,050 --> 00:20:09,890
She just has to get on a plane once.

244
00:20:10,630 --> 00:20:13,170
 I'll pay for the ticket and even pay her. 

245
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:15,870
Great! Scared me!

246
00:20:15,870 --> 00:20:19,040
Okay, okay. You almost got him.

247
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:26,020
So, what do we need to do?

248
00:20:26,810 --> 00:20:29,970
Geez, you're so impatient.

249
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:42,810
Did it get disconnected?

250
00:20:42,810 --> 00:20:44,920
Why isn't there any sound?

251
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,340
Did something bad happen?

252
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:54,370
Hyung Do Chan. Hyung. Hyung!

253
00:20:54,370 --> 00:20:56,190
Do Chan!

254
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:19,970
A man... a man is dead! A man!

255
00:21:19,970 --> 00:21:23,170
A dead man!

256
00:21:23,170 --> 00:21:25,080
A dead man!

257
00:21:26,370 --> 00:21:28,460
This is bad! Really bad!

258
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:30,850
- What is it? 
 - He's dead.

259
00:21:30,850 --> 00:21:33,240
- Who? 
 - Nam Seung Tae.

260
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:34,280
Nam Seung Tae?

261
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:37,870
He was found to have killed himself in Bookhan Mountain.

262
00:21:37,870 --> 00:21:39,170
We were supposed to meet tomorrow.

263
00:21:39,170 --> 00:21:43,450
Well, I guess we'll still have to do the autopsy. But don't you think it's a murder disguised as suicide?

264
00:21:43,450 --> 00:21:49,310
He was going to get money. Why would he commit suicide? Aigoo, seriously.

265
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:53,740
But where is Sa Do Chan?

266
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:55,770
He went to the nap roo—

267
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:02,840
This is bad.

268
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:52,480
Why do you wear a wig like this, Prosecutor?

269
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:09,120
Sa Do Chan.

270
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,880
- What is it? 
 - I'm sorry.

271
00:23:17,630 --> 00:23:19,510
I'm sorry.

272
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:26,610
This conman. Where did he go?

273
00:23:32,830 --> 00:23:34,730
Pick up.

274
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:52,280
Prosecutor Baek Joon Soo.

275
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:57,870
You survived somehow last time, but this time it will be tough.

276
00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:10,080
Who are you guys?

277
00:24:10,930 --> 00:24:17,450
You guys think nothing of a Korean prosecutor. Who the hell are you?

278
00:24:17,450 --> 00:24:20,640
Our identity isn't important.

279
00:24:21,430 --> 00:24:26,920
What did you mess with? That's what's important.

280
00:24:40,010 --> 00:24:41,950
Wait a minute.

281
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:49,840
Actually, I'm not Baek Joon Soo.

282
00:24:55,330 --> 00:25:00,500
I look just like him, huh? Wow, something like this happens in my life.

283
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:04,030
I'm sure you can't believe me, but there's a complicated story.

284
00:25:04,030 --> 00:25:07,100
What can't you say when you're about to die?

285
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:08,710
Goodbye then.

286
00:25:08,710 --> 00:25:11,610
I'm not Baek Joon Soo. I'm Sa Do—

287
00:25:28,150 --> 00:25:30,340
What? What the heck?

288
00:26:56,200 --> 00:27:03,200


289
00:27:03,850 --> 00:27:05,690
 Switch
Change the World 

290
00:27:05,690 --> 00:27:06,950
 Switch
Change the World 

291
00:27:06,950 --> 00:27:08,190
 Why did you do such a thing without saying anything? 

292
00:27:08,190 --> 00:27:10,530
 You dragged me into such a dangerous game? 

293
00:27:10,530 --> 00:27:12,150
 What is it that you guys are investigating? 

294
00:27:12,150 --> 00:27:14,870
 He survived twice? Does that make sense? 

295
00:27:14,870 --> 00:27:16,980
 Are you really Prosecutor Baek Joon Soo? 

296
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:19,250
 I have the identity of Prosecutor Baek Joon Soo right now. 

297
00:27:19,250 --> 00:27:22,860
 If we do the setting right utilizing this, we get their money and run away. 

298
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:24,750
 President Jo, go to Sokcho. 

299
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:28,170
 If he survived the ocean, I'm sure he's been hospitalized. 

300
00:27:28,170 --> 00:27:32,450
 The personality can change, but a fingerprint can never change.
