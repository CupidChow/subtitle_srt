1
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:50,050
I heard from Prosecutor Oh Ha Ra.

2
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:52,070
In order to protect me and Prosecutor Oh,

3
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:55,380
I heard you came in for the attempted murder of Geum Tae Woong on purpose.

4
00:00:56,980 --> 00:00:59,300
I wanted to beat him up more,

5
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:01,490
but Prosecutor Oh arrived faster than I thought she would.

6
00:01:01,490 --> 00:01:04,570
You irritate me, Sa Do Chan.

7
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:09,940
Baek Joon Soo and Sa Do Chan. If one of us should survive,

8
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:12,360
Baek Joon Soo has to live.

9
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:19,900
So, I will kill you, Sa Do Chan.

10
00:01:24,490 --> 00:01:27,190
Why are those two people so serious?

11
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:32,850
Kill me? What are you talking about?

12
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:35,490
Sa Do Chan, you're now a suspect for attempted murder.

13
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:38,410
That means you have to be behind bars for at least a year or two

14
00:01:38,410 --> 00:01:42,490
which means the game with Brown Bear has no possibility of being won.

15
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:48,700
I will die as the con artist Sa Do Chan.

16
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:54,460
Look, Prosecutor Baek.

17
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,470
Please live as Prosecutor Baek Joon Soo.

18
00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:08,900
Why should I live as you?

19
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:14,400
Even if I go to jail, I can run away. Don't worry about me.

20
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:20,360
I refuse your suggestion.

21
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:25,410
I don't want to live as Baek Joon Soo. Why should I live someone else's life?

22
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:30,460
I'll stop persuading you here. I'll move forward with my plan.

23
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:37,180
Deputy Prosecutor.

24
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:38,890
 Prosecutors' Office 
 Unlocked 

25
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:45,210
What's going on? What did you two talk about?

26
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:50,060
What's with the mood?

27
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:54,370
Sunbae. What did you tell him?

28
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,820
What did you guys talk about?

29
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:06,180
What's with you two?

30
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:16,110
Place Sa Do Chan under arrest.

31
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:25,720
 Timing and

32
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:30,960
Please prepare the indictment against Sa Do Chan.

33
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,340
How should I prepare it?

34
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:34,630
Geum Tae Woong has claimed a homicide attempt.

35
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:36,780
Just write that down on the indictment.

36
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:38,440
Okay, I got it.

37
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:50,320
I did as you asked me to about Sa Do Chan, but I'm really sorry.

38
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:54,420
I'm sure we'll hire a lawyer for him and get him out as soon as we can.

39
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:57,080
But going to jail isn't easy for anyone.

40
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:02,940
Sunbae. Why aren't you saying anything?

41
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:33,040
You weren't sad that all of this time I only called out "pretty Mi Ran," were you?

42
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:40,140
I won't get to see you for a while, pretty Ha Ra.

43
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,910
 Switch 

44
00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:19,950
 14
 Between hot and cold 

45
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:41,800
What's going to happen to our oppa? How many years do you think he's going to get?

46
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:45,310
I'm not sure. Attempted murder and fraud.

47
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:47,670
About ten years?

48
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:49,570
On top of that it was against Geum Tae Woong.

49
00:05:49,570 --> 00:05:51,900
I can't see Oppa Do Chan for ten years?

50
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:54,300
No! I want to go with him!

51
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:56,350
No! Oppa!

52
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:59,740
Take me with you!

53
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:02,360
You can't see Hyung Do Chan even if you go to jail.

54
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,710
Do Chan, that punk.

55
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:08,370
He took it all on himself. I really don't know what he's thinking.

56
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:11,610
I feel so sorry for Oppa Do Chan.

57
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:16,020
For hitting the enemy who killed his dad, how could he get attempted murder?

58
00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:19,000
Isn't this too much from Prosecutors Baek and Oh?

59
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,720
They used him all they wanted to. How could they ignore him now?

60
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:26,190
I know. I told him not to trust prosecutors.

61
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,050
What happened to Sa Do Chan?

62
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:43,050
He's been transferred to a detention center.

63
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:46,770
Impersonation of a public official, assault, and attempted murder.

64
00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:50,720
He'll be there for at least a year or two or he'll be sentenced to the maximum of ten years.

65
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:55,350
To avoid the fact that they worked with a con artist, I'm sure they'll give him a hefty sentence.

66
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:58,180
Is that something that can be hidden?

67
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:00,370
Even though I know about it.

68
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:06,300
I won't let those two, Prosecutors Baek and Oh, off the hook.

69
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:15,290
Sa Do Chan, this bastard,  really tried to kill me.

70
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:19,120
I can't let him live no matter what.

71
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:26,670
Two-hundred billion won. Sa Do Chan noticed it and the Prosecutors' Office sensed it, too.

72
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:31,680
I have to start with that. Tell the lawyers to come.

73
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,500
All right.

74
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:43,390
I indicted Sa Do Chan for impersonation of a public official and attempted murder.

75
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:45,240
Good job.

76
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:51,730
Geum Tae Woong. Please let me investigate him for laundering illegal funds.

77
00:07:51,730 --> 00:07:54,030
Geum Tae Woong? Why?

78
00:07:54,030 --> 00:07:58,120
He got rid of his assets which were under borrowed names for the Turkistan natural gas project.

79
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:00,360
He siphoned that money away overseas.

80
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:03,460
Liechtenstein. It's a famous country for tax evasion.

81
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:06,020
Are you sure? Do you have evidence?

82
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:07,450
FinCEN confirmed it for us.
  FinCEN: Financial Crimes Enforcement Network 

83
00:08:07,450 --> 00:08:09,480
Are you sure it belongs to CEO Geum Tae Woong?

84
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:12,290
It's a secret account. There's no way he would've used his own name.

85
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:14,510
The account owner is Simon Jo.

86
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:16,740
Who's Simon Jo?

87
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:18,950
That's what we have to find out.

88
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:26,810
Leichtenstein. I heard it's a safe place and that's why I sent it there.

89
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:31,660
If the prosecutors' office requests cooperation from FinCEN, your account can be frozen.

90
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:37,910
But who is the account owner Simon Jo?

91
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:44,820
You don't have to know that. Just tell me what you propose.

92
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:48,820
You should launder your funds and bring them back into the country as soon as possible.

93
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:50,320
That's your best bet.

94
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:54,050
I'd need a reason if I want to bring in the money.

95
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:56,850
Why don't you open up a trading company?

96
00:08:58,840 --> 00:08:59,930
A trading company?

97
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:04,110
Foreign imported vehicles that are old aren't that expensive.

98
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:08,360
Buy them at several million won and sell them again overseas.

99
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:11,270
Set up a paper company overseas first.

100
00:09:11,270 --> 00:09:15,280
Sell the used cars to that company at high cost.

101
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:19,130
Do that and bring in 200 billion won back?

102
00:09:19,130 --> 00:09:25,110
Yes. But you'll need an international lawyer who knows a lot about that area.

103
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:28,870
Director Kim, look into getting a lawyer in that field.

104
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:30,730
Okay, will do.

105
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:34,950
And I don't need to set up a separate trading company.

106
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:39,740
Among my employees, I have someone who already runs a trading company.

107
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:43,300
- Next, let's hear the process in detail.
 - Okay.

108
00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:45,520
Have a look, please.

109
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:51,990
 VK Trading Company 

110
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:06,180
CEO, hello.

111
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:07,360
What were you doing?

112
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:10,760
I was reading a book.

113
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:12,560
Reading?

114
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:18,040
Do you have something you want me to do?

115
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:20,140
Let's sit.

116
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:22,880
 Do you know who your parents are? 

117
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:27,540
 That person is your father. He's your biological father. 

118
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,570
 If you get it now, go and be good to your father. 

119
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,410
 I'd never be able to forgive a father like that, though. 

120
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,530
I have something to tell you.

121
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,920
Do you still gamble?

122
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,880
No, no. I quit.

123
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:55,150
The history of a gamble is the history of a human betting his fate on an uncertainty.

124
00:10:55,860 --> 00:11:00,050
Gambling is fun, but you know,

125
00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:02,770
gambling legally is more fun.

126
00:11:02,770 --> 00:11:06,020
What? Gambling legally?

127
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:10,600
I'm about to teach you real gambling starting now.

128
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:15,440
Since you have a sign that says you're a trading company, run the business properly.

129
00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:19,950
Buy used foreign vehicles,

130
00:11:19,950 --> 00:11:24,130
and sell them to the foreign collectors.

131
00:11:24,130 --> 00:11:26,150
I'll work hard.

132
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:31,600
 Establish law and rule: Detention Center 

133
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:38,480
Hey, 408. You pretended to be a prosecutor, right?

134
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,990
How dare you pretend to be a government official?

135
00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:45,470
Guys like you who scam pretending to be professionals are the most despicable.

136
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:50,490
Geez, so disappointing. Professional? I'm a real prosecutor.

137
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:54,870
Because there is some misunderstanding between me and the judiciary,

138
00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:57,320
I am getting fed by the judiciary (in their custody).

139
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,860
Once I get out of here,

140
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:03,140
- I'll go directly to the prosecutors' office... 
 - A**hole, you sure are a con man.

141
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:07,210
Hey, 828, you worked at city hall?

142
00:12:07,210 --> 00:12:10,040
We shouldn't do this to each other as we're both government officials.

143
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:12,480
Both the same government officials?

144
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:15,110
You came in for accepting a bribe, right?

145
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:18,290
Five years in jail. Did you receive around 100 million won?

146
00:12:18,290 --> 00:12:19,780
Fifty-million won!

147
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:23,090
Fifty-million... Geez, what a waste.

148
00:12:23,090 --> 00:12:26,840
If you had gotten ten-million won less, you could have gotten probation.

149
00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:30,690
R-Really?

150
00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:37,260
Go ask the briber to testify like this in front of a judge.

151
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:41,460
"On your way over, you bought a drink that cost 1,000 won because I was so thirsty."

152
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:45,020
Then, the money you received becomes under 50 million won.

153
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:47,840
Then, you can have probation.

154
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:50,390
Hyungnim, I mean, Prosecutor, thank you!

155
00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:52,640
Thank you! Bow!

156
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:55,800
Prosecutor, it's so unfair for me, too. Please hear me out.

157
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:58,500
Okay. One at a time.

158
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:03,450
That's not it.

159
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:04,900
Something's wrong with your sentence.

160
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:08,220
It was a crime of impulse. That's the problem.

161
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:12,660
 Prisoner entrance/exit 

162
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:16,690
Oppa! Are you okay? Your face is so gaunt!

163
00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:20,980
You're fine. You're still so handsome.

164
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:24,130
My soul is having its heyday for the first time in a long time.

165
00:13:24,130 --> 00:13:27,450
I'm eating and resting well, so don't worry.

166
00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:30,660
Right. Even on a desert island, our Do Chan will

167
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:34,600
scam seagulls and have them deliver fish to him.

168
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:43,540
Did you find out what their moves are?

169
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:46,660
Big Bear has been having meetings with lawyers for days.

170
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:49,890
Bang-Bang is suddenly purchasing used cars.

171
00:13:49,890 --> 00:13:51,040
Used cars?

172
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:55,710
Foreign vintage cars, you know. The ones collectors like.

173
00:13:57,790 --> 00:13:59,660
I see the big picture.

174
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:04,320
The 200 billion won that's overseas. He's trying to bring that back into the country.

175
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:07,900
In Tae got him a bit upset with the fake hacking job.

176
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:12,550
Big Bear got scared, so he's trying to get all that back.

177
00:14:13,610 --> 00:14:16,880
If that's the case, he'll try to open up a trading company.

178
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:21,200
He'll need an international lawyer who will work in the middle.

179
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:28,660
Okay. Shall we set it up?

180
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:30,540
A setting?

181
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:38,370
This plan is called Big Store Plan.

182
00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:42,670
You borrow the authority which an actual attorney's firm gives for a little bit. 
  Roy &amp; Royce Law Firm 

183
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:49,190
I am Law Partner Park Hyeok.

184
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,530
In Tae will be the inside man

185
00:14:53,530 --> 00:14:57,700
in the attorney's office that CEO Kim wants to approach.

186
00:15:00,070 --> 00:15:02,050
 Attorney Park Hyeok 

187
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:22,390
- Let's go have lunch. 
 - Yes.

188
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,660
Director Bong is the Big Store manager.

189
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:42,770
 Big Store Manager: A person that takes care of the big store and knows what's going on. 

190
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:04,120
Eun Ji is the Tailor. You have to make sure that the attorney is 30 minutes late to the meeting.

191
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:06,410
Oh yes.

192
00:16:06,410 --> 00:16:08,560
Yes, yes.

193
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:16,150
 Roy &amp; Royce Law Firm 

194
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:26,820
He can't be coming out already.

195
00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:31,620
It's a new beer. Please drink some and fill out a survey.

196
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:34,050
I quit drinking.

197
00:16:34,050 --> 00:16:36,100
I didn't know that.

198
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:38,160
This is soda. Not beer.

199
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,300
 Roy &amp; Royce Law Firm 

200
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:50,200
Where is Attorney Park Hyeok's office?

201
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:52,750
It's the one on the right at the end of the hall.

202
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:06,120


203
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:11,550
Yes. Yes, please do that.

204
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:19,660
I'm Kim Hyeon Wook. I called you earlier. I'm here five minutes earlier than our appointed time.

205
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:23,250
I am the partner lawyer Park Hyeok from Roy &amp; Royce law firm.

206
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:26,470
I'm fine.

207
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:30,800
I'm working so hard trying to earn my tuition, yet you won't even treat me like a human being?

208
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,570
You won't even taste test just because you quit drinking?

209
00:17:32,570 --> 00:17:35,830
It's not that. I don't drink.

210
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:38,430
I said it's a soda.

211
00:17:42,430 --> 00:17:44,030
Geez!

212
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:46,490
This is beer!

213
00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:49,230
It's soda.

214
00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:52,930
Oh, is it soda that tastes like beer?

215
00:17:52,930 --> 00:17:54,040
Move.

216
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:57,260
Please fill out this survey since you drank.

217
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:07,870
In Tae, quote a really high price. Hike it up to 20 percent.

218
00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:09,830
Twenty percent?

219
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:14,140
As you know, it's all about know-how in this field.

220
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:17,460
Because I'm a sure thing, I'm a bit expensive.

221
00:18:26,990 --> 00:18:28,790
Thank you.

222
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:30,430
Oh, I'm sorry.

223
00:18:30,430 --> 00:18:33,060
The door...

224
00:18:38,090 --> 00:18:39,780
Forget it.

225
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:16,140
 Han River Detention Center 

226
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:19,550
 Rules for visitors 

227
00:19:25,930 --> 00:19:28,710
This is Attorney Jeong Choon Gi, your attorney.

228
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:32,700
Please have a talk first. I'll step outside.

229
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:49,200
What? I'm sure you didn't come by because you wanted to hear me say "pretty Ha Ra."

230
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:55,760
How did you know? I've been so sad all this time.

231
00:19:55,760 --> 00:20:01,170
Don't you remember? I told you that you were pretty from the first time I met you.

232
00:20:02,490 --> 00:20:04,720
 I'm genuinely grateful. 

233
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,390
 About what? 

234
00:20:07,430 --> 00:20:09,710
 Grateful that you got pretty while I didn't get to see you. 

235
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,800
I feel so bad toward you...

236
00:20:20,790 --> 00:20:23,620
for making you sacrifice in such a big way.

237
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:28,710
Don't worry about me. Don't skip your meals and do a good job.

238
00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:32,230
Don't walk alone when you're going home.

239
00:20:33,410 --> 00:20:34,970
Okay.

240
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,330
Listen to me carefully.

241
00:20:42,330 --> 00:20:46,800
My father left me an inheritance.

242
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,760
An inheritance?

243
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:51,260
- 200 billion won. 
 - 200 billion won?

244
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:55,100
He told me who the owner of the 200 billion won is before he died.

245
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:58,860
It's Simon Jo.

246
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:04,740
I did find that out when I traced the account, but I haven't found out who Simon Jo is yet.

247
00:21:05,970 --> 00:21:07,260
But how did you...

248
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:11,070
I told you. It's my father's legacy to me.

249
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:15,630
My father wanted to catch Brown Bear Geum Tae Woong all his life.

250
00:21:15,630 --> 00:21:18,380
Don't you think he looked into such a thing?

251
00:21:19,470 --> 00:21:23,500
Simon Jo is Jo Seong Doo.

252
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:24,750
Jo Seong Doo?

253
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:29,230
Jo Seong Doo is a lot more despicable and scary than you think.

254
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:31,900
It's good to be careful.

255
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:35,740
Why would Geum Tae Woong give that money to Jo Seong Doo?

256
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:37,820
Because Jo Seong Doo is his son.

257
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:45,480
Don't you think this is a great legacy from my father? Geum Tae Woong's weakness.

258
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:48,180
Why is that Geum Tae Woong's weakness?

259
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:53,650
Jo Seong Doo is not just a son, but a hidden son. The son CEO Geum abandoned.

260
00:21:53,650 --> 00:21:59,760
In order to marry Governor Choi Jeong Pil's daughter, he cruelly abandoned Jo Seong Doo.

261
00:22:01,310 --> 00:22:04,870
Geum Tae Woong will never reveal to him that he is his father

262
00:22:04,870 --> 00:22:07,160
for the sake of his pride.

263
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:11,840
Prosecutor Oh, get Jo Seong Doo.

264
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:16,140
Get him and tell him that he has 200 billion won in his name in an international account.

265
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:21,040
Then there will be a breakdown within Geum Tae Woong's organization.

266
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:28,740
This. This, this one.

267
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:30,800
- How much is this one? 
 - This one?

268
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,730
- 10.9 million won.
 - 10.9 million won?

269
00:22:32,730 --> 00:22:37,520
It sells for 10 million won on the internet. What are you talking about?

270
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:39,210
Then, what do you think about this one?

271
00:22:39,210 --> 00:22:42,020
- How much is this one?
 - This is under 10 million won. It's cheap.

272
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:43,520
This looks good, huh? Show me this one.

273
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,140
- Here, this way. It's over there. 
 - Let's go.

274
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:47,330
-  Let's take a look. 
 - Okay, okay.

275
00:22:47,330 --> 00:22:52,520
Why does CEO order us to buy the used cars under ten million won when they don't even run properly?

276
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:54,960
Who'd know what he's thinking?

277
00:22:54,960 --> 00:23:00,390
Since he's asking me to do this, I'll have to just do it and cover it up.

278
00:23:00,390 --> 00:23:02,730
Cover.

279
00:23:02,730 --> 00:23:05,430
Hello, we're from the Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office.

280
00:23:05,430 --> 00:23:08,160
You're CEO Jo Seong Doo of the WK Trading Company, right?

281
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:13,260
Yes. We met last time. What? Is there something else now?

282
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:15,350
That must be why we're here, right?

283
00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:18,920
You must be shopping for a car, huh?

284
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:22,300
Why did they bring me in? I don't think I did anything wrong.

285
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:24,620
Am I going to jail again?

286
00:23:33,490 --> 00:23:38,110
Your international account has been detected by the financial investigations.

287
00:23:41,370 --> 00:23:44,180
You have to reveal where you got that money from.

288
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:46,790
I have an international account?

289
00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:50,630
I-I only have a bank account with a negative balance.

290
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:54,390
There's 200 billion won under your name and you say you don't know about it?

291
00:23:54,390 --> 00:23:58,970
Two... Two... Two-hundred billion won?

292
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:02,500
Whoa.

293
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:05,440
This doesn't make sense at all.

294
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:08,660
 Simon Jo 

295
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:13,660
What? The Prosecutors' Office took in Seong Doo? For what crime?

296
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:18,460
Well, I heard they came and got him all of a sudden while shopping for the used car.

297
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:21,380
I don't know why they did that all of a sudden.

298
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:25,010
Call up Chief Prosecutor Jin right away.

299
00:24:25,010 --> 00:24:26,590
Okay.

300
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:40,250
Mr. Jo.

301
00:24:41,490 --> 00:24:43,460
Director Kim.

302
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:46,430
You came for me?

303
00:24:46,430 --> 00:24:48,720
Why did they get you? For what crime?

304
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:52,780
I don't know. They keep asking me if I have slush funds overseas.

305
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:57,520
It's so strange. They say it's under the name Simon Jo.

306
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:58,890
Simon Jo?

307
00:24:58,890 --> 00:25:04,100
You didn't know? They're saying I'm that Simon Jo.

308
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:06,670
They said I have 200 billion won.

309
00:25:09,490 --> 00:25:12,120
What's going on?

310
00:25:39,410 --> 00:25:41,300
How is it going looking for the money laundering expert?

311
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:46,940
I met with several international law attorneys. One of them who seems very capable asked for too much money.

312
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:47,990
I'm thinking about it.

313
00:25:47,990 --> 00:25:50,480
You think that's important right now?

314
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:54,320
It's better to be safe when you bring in billions.

315
00:25:55,920 --> 00:26:01,100
Hurry up and acquire him before Baek Joon Soo digs further into this and proceed with it.

316
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:02,650
Okay.

317
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:10,600
There are batteries for all these, right?

318
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:17,210
In Tae, didn't you ask for too much? Why isn't he biting the bait?

319
00:26:17,210 --> 00:26:20,360
I did as Do Chan told me to do.

320
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:24,060
 Director Kim 

321
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:32,530
Hurry, hurry.

322
00:26:35,330 --> 00:26:37,310
Yes, this is Attorney Park Hyeok.

323
00:26:37,310 --> 00:26:42,690
This is Director Kim Hyeon Wook from last time. I'd like to meet with you again.

324
00:26:42,690 --> 00:26:44,880
Yes, sure.

325
00:26:55,690 --> 00:26:58,510
Welcome, Prosecutor Baek.

326
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:02,200
You don't look too good.

327
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:07,490
Are you that sad that a con artist who used to move around like your avatar is sitting in jail?

328
00:27:07,490 --> 00:27:10,190
You're amazing.

329
00:27:10,190 --> 00:27:13,250
The prosecutors' office is being played in the palm of your hand.

330
00:27:13,250 --> 00:27:17,410
That's nothing. All these things can't happen for free.

331
00:27:17,410 --> 00:27:19,020
It costs a lot.

332
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:22,290
That cost, I'll reveal it.

333
00:27:22,290 --> 00:27:25,280
I'll investigate how you laundry slush funds.

334
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:29,250
If you stop me from doing that, I will investigate your attempting murder and smuggling drugs.

335
00:27:29,250 --> 00:27:33,940
Everything. I'll investigate everything.

336
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:38,600
I'll take that as a declaration of war.

337
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:44,280
If you start a war, I'll have to fight back.

338
00:27:48,650 --> 00:27:50,840
I feel more comfortable with this.

339
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:55,390
Trying to figure out if you're Baek Joon Soo or Sa Do Chan. Trying to figure out if you're my friend or foe.

340
00:27:55,390 --> 00:27:59,700
It's much easier to fight the enemy once I can identify him.

341
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:04,290
When this war is over, I've told you this before.

342
00:28:04,290 --> 00:28:09,030
I'll punish you for the sin of you working with the con artist.

343
00:28:09,030 --> 00:28:14,860
Then, you'll never be able to work as a prosecutor again.

344
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:22,690
I'm saying this will be the last time you'll be standing in front of me with your head held high just because you're a prosecutor.

345
00:28:22,690 --> 00:28:25,470
Do you perhaps know this?

346
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:30,200
The car accident that I was involved on my way up from Sokcho to Seoul.

347
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:34,260
You ordered Director Kim to do that.

348
00:28:35,330 --> 00:28:40,630
You had reported that plan to Governor Choi Jeong Pil.

349
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:45,490
 Prosecutor Baek Joon Soo is coming back to Seoul. 

350
00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:49,570
 I think he found a video clip of me smuggling drugs. 

351
00:28:49,570 --> 00:28:52,470
 How did he get that? 

352
00:28:52,470 --> 00:28:57,790
 If that comes out to the world, you're finished since you were recorded on the spot. 

353
00:28:57,790 --> 00:29:03,330
 I can't let him be. I gave my order to Director Kim. 

354
00:29:03,330 --> 00:29:08,600
 I told him to push him off the road on his way up from Sokcho. 

355
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:25,510
 Prosecutor Baek Joon Soo... He'll become fish food. 

356
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:32,950
And Governor Choi recorded that conversation.

357
00:29:35,890 --> 00:29:40,790
And Sa Do Chan currently has that voice recording.

358
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:47,330
I still don't know where that voice file is.

359
00:29:47,330 --> 00:29:52,860
There's no way he would've taken that with him to jail.

360
00:29:57,230 --> 00:30:00,700
