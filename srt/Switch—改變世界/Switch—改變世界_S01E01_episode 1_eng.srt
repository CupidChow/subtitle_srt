The gamblers are having a great time today.

4
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:43,070
Money, money, money...

5
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:53,870
I won! Money!

6
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:05,670
Eight bamboos. 
 (Mahjong tile) 

7
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:14,270
Three "man".
 (Mahjong tile, "man" is the character for ten thousand) 

8
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:29,570
Whatever.

9
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:34,970
Wow. I won, I won again! How can I get this, huh?

10
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:39,170
- What's with this guy? You've been sweeping up all the money. 
 - So thirsty.

11
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:41,070
Give me a drink... Ah, here it is.

12
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:43,370
I was waiting for "hun yi se."

13
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:46,150
He says he was also looking at Hon Il from earlier. 
  Hon Il - one of the plays in mahjong 

14
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:48,770
They say I shouldn't win against someone who looks out for Hon Il.

15
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:51,170
Shut up! Mix the tiles!

16
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:55,950
Don't you think Korean prosecutors have lots of problems?

17
00:01:55,970 --> 00:01:58,970
Everyone's blinded by their desire for success, so they only pay attention to big cases.

18
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:02,570
They have no interest in catching con men.

19
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:07,770
I wonder where all the prosecutors are at when the gamblers are over there.

20
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:10,670
Isn't that why I'm here?

21
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:13,770
You're right, Prosecutor.

22
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:18,670
The problem is with the Prosecutors' Office.

23
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:44,870
Thank you, arigato, xie xie, gozaimase.

24
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:47,770
Beautiful.

25
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:51,970
I knew I have such good luck with my tiles.

26
00:02:52,970 --> 00:02:54,670
Like this one...

27
00:02:54,770 --> 00:02:56,270
You have to wear stuff like this.

28
00:02:56,370 --> 00:02:58,470
I got screwed?

29
00:02:58,570 --> 00:03:00,470
My money...

30
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:06,070
Hey! Your tiles are different from the ones I saw earlier.

31
00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:08,570
Are you cheating?

32
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:10,670
What? Cheating?

33
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:12,470
Cheat?

34
00:03:12,570 --> 00:03:15,570
Geez, this fatso. How dare you spew bulls***?

35
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:17,470
All right, everyone. Zaijian.

36
00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:20,070
You a**holes!

37
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:22,670
You're with him, huh?

38
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:28,570
What are you saying? I lost, too.

39
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:32,370
Yes, yes, yes...

40
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:43,770
Hey, how do you say "Save me" in Chinese?

41
00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:45,570
Bang, bang, wo.

42
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:47,670
Bang, bang, wo. Bang, bang—

43
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:50,270
Bang!

44
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:53,870
- Who are you guys? 
 - We're from the Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office.

45
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:56,270
We received a report saying that there's illegal gambling going on.

46
00:03:56,370 --> 00:04:01,370
There must be a misunderstanding. They're friends having an important meeting.

47
00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:11,170
Rich people must talk with their guns, huh?

48
00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:15,170
Push in.

49
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:19,570
Hey! Stop!

50
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:28,270
How dare you deceive me.

51
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:34,670
Boss! We have to get out of here! The prosecutor is here!

52
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:36,070
Don't run!

53
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:51,470
Freeze! Check the room!

54
00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:54,370
Come over here.

55
00:04:55,970 --> 00:04:59,470
Come out! Don't hide!

56
00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:01,570
Please let us go.

57
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:04,670
Hands behind your head!

58
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:07,070
- Stay still!
 - If my husband finds out...

59
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:10,570
Oh, my. Oh, my.

60
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:17,170
Gambling and even murder. Arrest everyone!

61
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:19,070
Yes, sir!

62
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:22,470
What is it?

63
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:28,270
- Detective Kim, go after him and get him! 
 - Yes, sir!

64
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:45,770
Hey! Get back here!

65
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:49,670
I'll catch you. Let go!

66
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:52,960
- Boss... 
 - Hey, run! Run!

67
00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:26,570
Confiscate all the evidence found at the scene and

68
00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:30,370
- arrest everyone and take them all to Seoul! 
 - Yes, sir!

69
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:32,560
Don’t make a move.

70
00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:34,870
- How about the runaways? 
 - They got away.

71
00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:36,370
They got away?

72
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:40,270
They ran away far far away on a boat.

73
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:43,970
Far away? Far?

74
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:48,870
Then, they're not coming back, huh?

75
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:55,070
Okay. The guests left. Let's quickly clean up the shop and close up!

76
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:14,660
Use weaker gun powder next time.

77
00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:16,570
I almost died.

78
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:20,470
As expected, you're the best button there is, Oppa.
  (Button: conmen impersonate cops, make "arrests" and purposely let the real fraud targets escape.) 

79
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:23,270
Wow. Looks like it'll be close to 3 billion won.

80
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:27,370
As expected of our Do Chan... He's a genius at setting. 
  (Setting: situation set up for the purpose of committing fraud.) 

81
00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:32,870
 Spend sparingly. Because conning is only temporary, but life is long. 

82
00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:34,870
I love you.

83
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:37,870

Oh! Hey, you've been reassigned to Seoul.

87
00:08:04,370 --> 00:08:05,870
I'm on my way to Seoul.

88
00:08:05,970 --> 00:08:09,670
Already? You're starting next week.

89
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:15,970
That guy... I persuaded him. He says he'll hand over the item.

90
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:18,070
Who? Nam Soon Tae?

91

Where are you supposed to meet him?

92
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:26,370
Just a moment.

Hey, hey, hey!

97
00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:43,870
You sneered at me earlier, you crazy b****!

98
00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:46,670
No, I didn't. I didn't laugh at you.

99
00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:48,870
Who the hell are you guys?

100
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:54,580
Hey, you guys work at a bar. How dare you look down on me!

101
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:57,760
No, I didn't laugh at you.

102
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:02,870
Crazy... I'm going crazy...

103
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:06,960
Hey, what are you looking at?

104
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:12,300
Geez... what kind of 18th century (pun: f***ing bastard) situation is this in 2018?

105
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:16,840
If you create a scene holding a knife, "Oppa, you're so cool!"

106
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:19,940
You think girls would look up to you, you loser?

107
00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:27,260
Who are you, b****? You crazy b****! Get lost!

108
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:29,210
But what can I do?

109
00:11:29,210 --> 00:11:31,990
For you to have pride as a man,

110
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:34,970
you look a bit small.

111
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:40,730
You don't even have a proper package. How care you show off your strength?

112
00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:43,150
You!

113
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:56,220
You crazy b****... You're going to die today.

114
00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:05,630
Be a good boy, okay?

115
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:11,790
Thank you.

116
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:13,860
Thank you.

117
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:19,660

Prosecutor Oh, is something wrong?

120
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:37,760
I don't have my ID. Please open the gate.

121
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:42,210
You must go over there and submit a document to comply with procedure.

122
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,140
Prosecutor Oh!

123
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:16,420
What happened to Sunbae Baek?

124
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:20,580
Prosecutor Oh, what do we do? Prosecutor Baek got into a huge car accident.

125
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:22,360
Where? How badly is he hurt?

126
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:26,300
He hit a truck and fell into the ocean.

127
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:30,400
He's in surgery. What do we do?

128
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,390
Where?

129
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:37,050
The common factors these artwork demonstrate are...

130
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:39,970
You can say that he was heavily influenced by Wassily Kandinsky.

131
00:13:39,970 --> 00:13:42,140
Ah, Kandinsky.

132
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:46,850
Yes. With an abstract composition that displays pure colors,

133
00:13:46,850 --> 00:13:50,360
he's a master of the abstract contemporary art that combines the shapes and flavors of Matisse.

134
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:53,260
The funny thing is that when Kandinsky listened to music,

135
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:56,650
I hear he had an ability to sense colors.

136
00:13:56,650 --> 00:14:02,260
Oh, my. There's nothing you don't know, CEO Geum.

137
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:04,730
All right, let's go to the next one.

138
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:13,860
Ugh, Joon Soo, Joon Soo, Joon Soo. Joon Soo, please be okay.

139
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:16,490
Geez, of all times, while he was on his way up to meet with Nam Seung Tae.

140
00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:19,140
- Nam Seung Tae? 
 - Yeah.

141
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:22,860
- Deputy Prosecutor. 
 - Huh?

142
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:25,090
I don't think this is a simple accident.

143
00:14:25,090 --> 00:14:26,490
What?

144
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:29,760
These jerks.

145
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:36,960
Oh, no... What do we do?

146
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:41,500
What do we do about our Joon Soo? Joon Soo.

147
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:45,330
Baek Joon Soo... don't you dare die!

148
00:14:45,330 --> 00:14:49,370
Hey, why would he die! Our Joon Soo won't die!

149
00:14:49,370 --> 00:14:53,150
Didn't you hear what the doctor said earlier? He said his injuries aren't life-threatening.

150
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:56,140
Joon Soo will get better in no time. Right?

151
00:14:56,140 --> 00:15:00,590
Thank you so much for surviving. I'm so relieved.

152
00:15:00,590 --> 00:15:05,020
What do you mean a relieved? They dared to push a prosecutor into the ocean!

153
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:07,800
Those bastards! We can never forgive them!

154
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:10,490
Right. We should never forgive them.

155
00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:13,320
Those bastards. Our Joon Soo...

156
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:15,960
What are you going to do?

157
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,630
What else?

158
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:22,280
First, I have to report to Deputy Chief Prosecutor and Chief Prosecutor.

159
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:26,830
They're willing to kill a prosecutor. If they find out he's still alive...

160
00:15:26,830 --> 00:15:28,390
If they do?

161
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:36,040
We have to move him to a place where no one will know.

162
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:37,720
 Ambulance 

163
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:42,830
 Sokcho Clinic 

164
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,920
He'll be okay, won't he?

165
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:02,130
Don't worry.

166
00:16:02,130 --> 00:16:07,180
The hospital director there is my friend. He said he'd keep this a secret. No worries.

167
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:13,300
 Gapyeong Hospital 

168
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:22,330
 Do not enter 

169
00:16:46,830 --> 00:16:52,020
Both people and fish, we all fight hard to survive.

170
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:57,170
What happened to that?

171
00:16:57,170 --> 00:17:00,660
I took care of it as you ordered. But there's a problem...

172
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:02,540
What problem?

173
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:08,560
 They lifted the car, but the car door was open and the car was empty. 

174
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:12,620
I couldn't verify there is a body, but I'm pretty sure he drowned.

175
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:18,110
"Pretty sure." You're guessing, huh?

176
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:23,040
Do you know what the biggest fish is for a fisherman?

177
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:28,500
The fish he lost.

178
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:41,210
 Resident ID 

179
00:17:49,050 --> 00:17:50,390
 Nam Seung Tae 

180
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:54,100
Hello?

181
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:56,130
 Who's this? 

182
00:17:56,130 --> 00:17:58,800
You're Nam Seung Tae, right?

183
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:03,960
I'm Prosecutor Oh Ha Ra and I work with Prosecutor Baek Joon Soo.

184
00:18:04,610 --> 00:18:06,560
 Where is Prosecutor Baek? 

185
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:12,220
Sunbae Baek got injured. I'll meet you in his place.

186
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:15,230
 I don't trust anyone other than Prosecutor Baek. 

187
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,770
Oh, come in.

188
00:18:28,050 --> 00:18:31,410
Did you find out who drove that truck?

189
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:33,060
I did, but

190
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:36,150
the name on the ID was fake. 
  Resident ID 

191
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:38,400
The shots are blurry, too.

192
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,400
How about Nam Seung Tae?

193
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:46,960
I just spoke to him, but he says he won't meet anyone other than Sunbae Baek.

194
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:14,370
I'll be back.

195
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:20,730
I'm allowed to pack some soju since we're going to China, right?

196
00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:24,470
You stop drinking. Hyung, let's hurry up and do it!

197
00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:28,580
Oh, no! Died, died, died... geez.

198
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:33,100
You country folks. There are so many good things once we go there.

199
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:38,600
- I just have to change. Chan is already dressed.
 - Hurry up!

It's awesome. I like cash, but it's too heavy.

202
00:19:48,850 --> 00:19:51,230
Hyung, Hyung, look at this.

203
00:19:53,170 --> 00:19:55,380
 Mr. A, under suspicion of smuggling drugs commits suicide in jail 

204
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:57,340
What's this?

205
00:19:57,340 --> 00:19:58,560
He looks exactly like you.

206
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:04,080
Right? Totally the same, huh? It's news from a year ago. I found it while deleting Hyung's files.

207
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:07,360
 There was no coercive investigation and all procedures 

208
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:11,920
 were conducted legally. 

209
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:15,120
What do you think? Aren't you guys the same?

210
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:18,240
Should we do a prosecutor setting?

211
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:21,350
I don't know about anything else. I'd never be a prosecutor.

212
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:23,610
Why not?

00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:46,530
This is so weird.

216
00:20:46,530 --> 00:20:49,300
A prosecutor showed up knowing that there was a gambling ring on a desert island?

217
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:53,010
On top of that, without the help of the precinct? On a motor boat?

218
00:20:53,010 --> 00:20:55,650
I know a detective at an Incheon police station, so I asked him.

219
00:20:55,650 --> 00:20:58,920
There's not been any report of a gambling ring arrest recently.

220
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:01,490
No gunshot incident nor murder.

221
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:07,950
I think we've been had. How dare they work on Jo Seong Do!

222
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:12,140
Release more guys! Look everywhere those punks could be!

223
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:13,550
Yes, sir!

224
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:23,190
 Why a ship? We're not taking a plane, but a ship?
   

225
00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:26,890
Hey, departure! What time is our ship leaving?

226
00:21:26,890 --> 00:21:31,080
- 9:40 am. 
 - 9:40 am. We're right on time.

227
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:33,740
I'll get severely seasick.

228
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:35,120
Hey, did you bring your passport?

229
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,220
How long will it take?

230
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:41,070
Excuse me, sir.

231
00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:43,250
I have a favor to ask of you.

232
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:45,830
This ship...

233
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:48,200
My daughter-in-law was going to get on it.

234
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:52,010
But her water broke, so she had to go to the hospital.

235
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:55,980
My son is waiting for me at the Tianjin terminal.

236
00:21:55,980 --> 00:22:01,840
Well, could you give this to him?

237
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:06,960
This looks quite expensive.

238
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:09,140
Careful, careful, careful.

239
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:10,890
Isn't that a con?

240
00:22:10,890 --> 00:22:12,990
I know, right?

241
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:16,990
He's falling for her on purpose.

242
00:22:16,990 --> 00:22:17,980
While he knows?

243
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:20,100
I guess you don't know Do Chan well yet.

244
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:24,240
See? Even at a glance, she's doing it to make a living.

245
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:26,980
A con man knows that it's a fraud and he's falling for it?

246
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:28,330
Let's go on first.

247
00:22:28,330 --> 00:22:32,720
He'll listen to her story and give her a bunch of money before he comes.

248
00:22:34,870 --> 00:22:37,880
How could a con man be so compassionate?

249
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:42,180
This... so...

250
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:45,100
Hyungnim, over there.

251
00:22:47,650 --> 00:22:50,850
So, what is it you want to say? Hurry, hurry. Kuaidi (Quickly, in Chinese)

252
00:22:50,850 --> 00:22:55,200
Kuai... So, my son's water broke...

253
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:58,900
I mean, that's not how it goes. My daughter-in-law is an illegal alien...

254
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:01,330
Illegal... illegal alien...

255
00:23:01,330 --> 00:23:04,940
Here. I'll give you 10,000 Yuan as a deposit.

256
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:06,120
Satisfied?

257
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:09,290
Stay strong. Practice more.

258
00:23:09,290 --> 00:23:10,700
Go.

259
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:12,580
Xie xie.

260
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:17,120
Hey Prosecutor.

261
00:23:20,970 --> 00:23:22,250
Hi.

262
00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:25,060
 Departure 

263
00:23:26,350 --> 00:23:28,530
Isn't that Bang, bang, wo?

264
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:34,170
You thought we were idiots and pulled a job on us, huh?

265
00:23:35,650 --> 00:23:37,470
I checked with the Prosecutors' Office.

266
00:23:37,470 --> 00:23:42,560
No one died from a gunshot wound and there was no prosecutor who raided a gambling house.

267
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:46,680
Isn't that totally weird? Logically, you know. Logically.

268
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:50,460
Prosecutor, let me see your ID.

 Government ID

Oh, I remember now. You're the ones who ran away while playing mahjong, huh?

271
00:24:00,690 --> 00:24:05,010
What do I do? I'm on another case and it's been crazy.

272
00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:08,900
Stay put somewhere. I'll come and get you after my investigation.

273
00:24:13,470 --> 00:24:17,980
I lost 3 billion won. 3 billlion won.

274
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:20,730
You think I'd let this go like this?

275
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:25,360
Don't you think we need to talk? Huh?

276
00:24:26,490 --> 00:24:30,350
Could you... handle it?

277
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:43,590
Hello.

278
00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:46,180
Inspector, this is Prosecutor Baek.

279
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:51,250
The gamblers we couldn't catch last time at the desert island... I'll arrest them and bring them in.

280
00:24:51,250 --> 00:24:53,820
What, what? Ah, yes.

281
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:56,330
Please look into an interrogation set up.

282
00:24:56,330 --> 00:24:58,940
Yes, I got it. I got it.

283
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:06,220
Emergency. Setting!

284
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:09,420
Take care of the prosecutor.

285
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:11,460
Let's go.

286
00:25:21,550 --> 00:25:23,720
Prosecutor Baek, hello.

287
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:25,600
Where are you coming from, Prosecutor?

288
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:28,660
Yeah. That case from last time. It's moving right along, right?

289
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:31,010
Yes, I wrapped up everything.

290
00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:38,060
We have to do that, okay?

291
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:41,100
I got it! This isn't the first time!

292
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,460
 Incheon Port 1st International Ferry Terminal  

293
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:52,610
Aigoo, Prosecutor. I'll carry it for you.

294
00:25:59,970 --> 00:26:02,030
What are you doing? This is my car.

295
00:26:02,030 --> 00:26:05,830
You're a fraud suspect until I'm fully convinced. Got it?

296
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:10,630
You said you were from Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office, right? We know the route to get there very well.

297
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:22,500
Fine. Do whatever you guys want to do.

298
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:27,660
But I'll never let this go easily. Got it?

299
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:29,260
Let's go.

300
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:55,440
Aigoo.

301
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,220
- Ahjussi! 
 - Hyung!

302
00:26:57,220 --> 00:27:00,840
I got it. I've haven't gotten into an accident in the last 25 years.

303
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:30,490
 Prosecutors' Office 

304
00:27:30,490 --> 00:27:34,870
 6 years before 

305
00:27:34,870 --> 00:27:38,170
 54th Bar Exam #1 

306
00:27:38,170 --> 00:27:42,830
Did you have a good dream? First exam is a cinch for you, right?

307
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:47,750
 Director Bong 

308
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:48,640
Hi Hyung.

309
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:52,330
 Do Chan! Save me! 

310
00:27:52,330 --> 00:27:54,750
Hyung, what's going on?

311
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:58,690
 What do I do? Save me. 

312
00:27:58,690 --> 00:28:02,830
 Do Chan, I only have you right now. 

313
00:28:02,830 --> 00:28:04,390
 Do Chan 
 54th Bar Exam #1 

314
00:28:04,390 --> 00:28:09,350
 I'm really sorry, but... 

315
00:28:09,350 --> 00:28:10,950
What's wrong?

316
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:15,590
Do Chan!

317
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:24,530
Inspector, I arrived. I'm in front of the lobby.

318
00:28:24,530 --> 00:28:26,760
Yes, Prosecutor.

319
00:28:27,650 --> 00:28:33,560
I'm really sorry, but there's been a small collision. You'll have to wait a bit.

320
00:28:36,250 --> 00:28:38,790
You're offsite?

321
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:43,860
Yes, come after you take care of your business.

Prosecutor Kim.

325
00:29:19,150 --> 00:29:22,170
You know that case? Take it easy.

326
00:29:22,170 --> 00:29:25,640
You'll hurt the Prosecutors' Office if you corner him too hard.

327
00:29:32,210 --> 00:29:36,290
My pretty Mi Ran. Hi.

328
00:29:36,290 --> 00:29:38,380
Oh, hello.

329
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:40,780
I don't have my ID right now.

330
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:44,670
Call up Detective Division 6 and ask them to send someone down.

331
00:29:46,270 --> 00:29:50,480
Me? Prosecutor Baek Joon Soo.

332
00:29:53,540 --> 00:29:56,920
In Tae, straighten your tie.

333
00:29:58,820 --> 00:30:00,880
Okay.

334
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:04,000
I called. He says he's coming down.

335
00:30:07,550 --> 00:30:09,310
Thanks.

336
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:18,600
Do you even know now what you guys did?

337
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:23,500
Of course. I said we're only going to check if you're a prosecutor or not.

338
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:31,100
Obstruction of Official Business. Code 136, article 1.

339
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:34,210
A person who assaults or threatens a government official

340
00:30:34,210 --> 00:30:36,660
can go to prison for a maximum of 5 years and/or pay a penalty of 10 million won.

341
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:39,370
On top of that, you even gambled, right?

342
00:30:39,370 --> 00:30:45,340
Code 246, a person who was arrested for illegal gambling will pay up to 10 million won in fines.

343
00:30:52,070 --> 00:30:56,830
Are you really a prosecutor?

344
00:30:59,090 --> 00:31:01,470
I'll give you my sincere advice.

345
00:31:01,470 --> 00:31:05,290
Just go on the count of three.

346
00:31:06,950 --> 00:31:10,030
I'll start the count to three. I really mean three.

347
00:31:10,030 --> 00:31:12,230
But still, let me confirm.

348
00:31:12,230 --> 00:31:17,510
I warned you. I said I'm going to count to three.

349
00:31:19,290 --> 00:31:21,090
One.

350
00:31:22,430 --> 00:31:24,030
Two.

351
00:31:24,030 --> 00:31:25,720
Boss.

352
00:31:27,210 --> 00:31:30,500
Two and a half of a half of a half, there no such a thing.

353
00:31:35,950 --> 00:31:37,470
Three!

354
00:31:37,470 --> 00:31:39,500
Baek Joon Soo!

355
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:47,280
Sunbae! A really long time no see. Have you been well? Aigoo...

356
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:49,340
You've gotten chubby.

359
00:31:58,020 --> 00:32:01,770
I'm into working out these days.

360
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:05,640
Oh, I'm here with some guests.

361
00:32:08,530 --> 00:32:10,060
Stop right there! Hey!
