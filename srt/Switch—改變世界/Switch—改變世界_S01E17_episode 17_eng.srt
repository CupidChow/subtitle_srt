00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,530
 Episode 17 
 Baek Joon Soo, I hear he's being called to the disciplinary committee tomorrow.

2
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:24,840
It's almost certain that he'll be dismissed.

3
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:33,820
 Timing and

4
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:47,500
Oh, Prosecutor Baek. What brings you here at this hour?

5
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:49,910
I'm here to sell a person.

6
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:55,380
This is a gallery. We buy and sell paintings. A person...

7
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:59,710
If I sell a fake Baek Joon Soo, is he worth buying for you?

8
00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:03,170
Fake Baek Joon Soo?

9
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:06,730
There's a con artist who's been pretending to be me all this time.

10
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:09,690
By chance, didn't you know?

11
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:13,440
A con artist?

12
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:17,290
Sa Do Chan.

13
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,710
Sa Do Chan?

14
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:30,030
There is a con artist who's pretending to be you?

15
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:35,680
And his name is Sa Do Chan?

16
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,330
I had been out for awhile.

17
00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:42,960
And that con artist was pretending to me while I was out.

18
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:47,530
 But you know, 

19
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:53,420
 Prosecutor Baek Joon Soo. Is he for real? 

20
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:57,520
 I feel as if I'm dealing with a ghost. 

21
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,480
 The car accident took place at 3 pm. 

22
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:02,610
 He went to Incheon from Sokcho in two hours? 

23
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:10,730
Fine. It's a supposition for now, but the important thing is

24
00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:16,490
why did that con artist meet with me all this time?

25
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:22,860
Sa Do Chan believes his father was murdered.

26
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:29,100
And he believes that the killer is you, CEO Geum Tae Woong.

27
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:42,440
That I killed a man?

28
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:45,040
Sa Ma Cheon.

29
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:50,890
Sa Do Chan's father.

30
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:56,720
- Ah, I see.
 - It's not important.

31
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:00,470
 I heard he was quite an infamous con artist in the past. So, I was wondering if I can find anything on him. 

32
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:05,770
 Have you met someone named Sa Ma Cheon in person? 

33
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:11,000
Wait, then...

34
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,220
Why are you saying that you'll sell Sa Do Chan to me?

35
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:19,330
Before you answer...

36
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:25,220
There's something I want to see.

37
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,920
Hey, you know Baek Joon Soo.

38
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,570
It was scary to see that nerd-type student get angry.

39
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:34,660
Blue sparks were coming out of his eyes.

40
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:37,770
Would he report us to the police?

41
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:40,830
Really?

42
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:46,130
Then, we're all in danger.

43
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:59,800
Sa Do Chan. I'm sure he's been set up.

44
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:23,470
It survived falling into the ocean with me.

45
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:24,890
In Sokcho.

46
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:27,350
It's believable evidence.

47
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:33,610
Now, let's begin our deal.

48
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:38,500
First, I have to know the size of the thing that I'm going to receive

49
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:41,280
in order to negotiate properly.

50
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:53,360
I'll become the knight in yourJanggi game. Your knight.

51
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,540
Use me as much as you can.

52
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:02,830
They say it's better to get rid of a smart person if you can't have him on your side.

53
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:07,530
If a smart man like you would be on my side...

54
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:14,990
Sa Do Chan and his posse. They're all at this location.

55
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:19,960
 Courtyard Residence
 Building A, #2007
 pw: #0800 

56
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:36,830
I'm going to have to talk to Sunbae.

57
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:52,650
 Switch 

58
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:56,690
 09
 Jealousy brings anger and anger brings about mistakes 

59
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:52,150
No one's here.

60
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:54,360
There's no one upstairs either.

61
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:02,530
That lobby earlier. Get them.

62
00:07:02,530 --> 00:07:04,090
Yes, sir!

63
00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:06,190
 Then, do you like any painters? 

64
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:08,150
 Mozart. 

65
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:11,700
Do you like any painters?

66
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:14,610
I don't know much about arts.

67
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:20,290
I believe Mozart is the best painter.

68
00:08:20,290 --> 00:08:24,090
Mozart... he's a musician.

69
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:27,340
Did he paint also?

70
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:33,250
You're still suspicious of me thinking I'm Sa Do Chan.

71
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:36,420
Should I take the lie detector test at the Prosecutors' Office?

72
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:42,130
No. It will take care of itself when we catch Sa Do Chan.

73
00:08:46,890 --> 00:08:48,430
What happened?

74
00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:50,240
We missed them.

75
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,120
You missed them?

76
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:57,250
- Are you sure? 
 - They snuck out in disguise.

77
00:08:57,250 --> 00:09:01,210
We didn't have a chance to check them out. I apologize.

78
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:07,190
Sunbae, let's talk...

79
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:17,540
 Sunbae Baek 

80
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,810
Sa Do Chan!

81
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:28,530
Director Bong!

82
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:47,030
Where did everyone go?

83
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:51,170
I turned Sa Do Chan over to you for sure.

84
00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:54,260
Yes. As for that,

85
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:57,630
we can catch him another time.

86
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:06,620
Now, let's hear what you want.

87
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:09,660
Please clear my name.

88
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:14,380
I didn't receive a bribe.

89
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:18,630
What's the second thing?

90
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:37,130
Would that really do it for you?

91
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:12,690
Sa Do Chan. What happened? Where did everyone go?

92
00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:17,420
Prosecutor Baek betrayed us. He sold us out to Geum Tae Woong.

93
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:20,560
No way. Why would Sunbae Baek do that?

94
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:23,000
Geum Tae Woong's minions came to get us.

95
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,390
The one who leaked our hangout location, who else could it be besides you and Deputy Prosecutor Yang?

96
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:32,890
Even so, why would he go through all that? To gain what?

97
00:11:32,890 --> 00:11:38,640
Each person has different ambitions. Prosecutor Baek. He's a prosecutor down to his bones.

98
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:43,860
And I ruined his position. I'm sure he'd make any deal,

99
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:46,400
even if he has to sell his soul to the devil.

100
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:48,110
Even so, to Geum Tae Woong—

101
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:52,220
This bribery scheme, it was Geum Tae Woong's doing from the get-go.

102
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:54,250
I made the mistake of falling for it.

103
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:59,030
But Geum Tae Woong is the only person who can undo that knot. That's why Prosecutor Baek went to that side.

104
00:11:59,030 --> 00:12:04,500
Then, that means he knows all about you pretending to be a prosecutor.

105
00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:08,440
I'm sure he told him about you working with me as well.

106
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:11,900
Sa Do Chan. It means you're in danger.

107
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:15,490
Now that your identity as a prosecutor is gone...

108
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,960
Was I a real prosecutor?

109
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:22,540
You'll be in real danger.

110
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:29,920
Don't worry. My heart beats slowly.

111
00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:33,670
What will you do now?

112
00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:44,130
Keep this safely.

113
00:12:49,610 --> 00:12:55,470
I'm sorry. I think I told Sunbae too much.

114
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:04,720
Prosecutor Oh. I told you not to look at me with such affection.

115
00:13:25,210 --> 00:13:27,680
I'm sorry, Prosecutor Oh.

116
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,490
It wasn't a bribe?

117
00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:44,310
Yes. Prosecutor Baek didn't know it was money when he accepted it.

118
00:13:44,310 --> 00:13:47,060
I lied.

119
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:52,370
I'm sorry. I'll take all the responsibility.

120
00:14:23,690 --> 00:14:27,330
Sunbae Baek, you're not qualified to be a prosecutor.

121
00:14:27,330 --> 00:14:30,830
I've been a prosecutor all this time and I'll continue to be.

122
00:14:30,830 --> 00:14:33,140
- How did you change so much? 
 - Nothing's changed.

123
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:35,480
You sold him out!

124
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:39,060
And you get to work at the prosecutors' office in return.

125
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:43,320
My position that you ruined because you lost your mind to a con artist,

126
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,960
I'm here to get my position back.

127
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,800
Just for that, you sold your soul to the devil?

128
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,240
Oh Ha Ra, choose your words wisely.

129
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:54,180
Those bastards turned foreign diplomats into drug smugglers and made a mockery of government entities.

130
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:58,020
They tried to terrorize and kill a prosecutor and someone who was to be a witness.

131
00:14:58,020 --> 00:15:03,060
They killed even Nam Seung Tae and Park Yeong Jin.

132
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:07,770
To kneel down to that devil and to get your prosecutor position back,

133
00:15:07,770 --> 00:15:10,070
what's the significance?

134
00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:14,090
Forget about the con artist.

135
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:21,000
With my own two feet, I'll go up each step from the beginning.

136
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:48,910


137
00:16:06,010 --> 00:16:08,800
Prosecutor Baek Joon Soo is coming back to work today, right?

138
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:11,800
Yes. The bribery charges have been cleared.

139
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:15,480
He'll be loyal to you from now on, Chief Prosecutor.

140
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:17,220
Baek Joon Soo?

141
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:21,850
You know the Lee Gi Roo file? Give that to Baek Joon Soo.

142
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:27,260
Tell him to hit him hard enough for him to retire from politics.

143
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:29,130
I got it.

144
00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:43,540
The bribery charge, I'm glad it was cleared for you.

145
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:45,660
I apologize for causing any concern.

146
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:48,000
You can do a good job from now on.

147
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:59,620
Lee Gi Roo. He's the general secretary of the Democratic National Party.

148
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:03,670
It's all the investigation files on him thus far.

149
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:08,160
It's weak. I can't get rid of him at once.

150
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:12,850
Get rid of this man. Get him to retire from the political arena.

151
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:24,810
Let's work well together in the future.

152
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:38,980
Ah, Prosecutor Baek, congratulations!

153
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:41,390
I believed in you, Prosecutor Baek.

154
00:17:41,390 --> 00:17:46,260
I knew you wouldn't do that. I, Go Gi Bong, know how to discern people.

155
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:48,890
Congratulations on coming back to work.

156
00:17:54,430 --> 00:17:56,730
Jae Yong, give me the files.

157
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:04,940
 Isn't Prosecutor Baek strange? 

158
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:07,340
 He was always weird. 

159
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:18,970
So neat. It's so similar to the last place we were at.

160
00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:22,500
How many places like this does Oppa Do Chan have?

161
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:25,310
I told you before.

162
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:28,570
To always be prepared for emergencies,

163
00:18:28,570 --> 00:18:31,160
he has several places under different names.

164
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:33,820
This is basic.

165
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:38,160
I'll have to redo the computer setting after work.

166
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,070
Good morning.

167
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:42,080
Oh, Hyung. Eat breakfast.

168
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:45,430
You didn't go to work, Oppa?

169
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:47,900
I told you I'll never play a prosecutor ever again.

170
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:51,300
Then, we're back to normal?

171
00:18:56,970 --> 00:19:01,090
You're back to normal. Yes!

172
00:19:01,870 --> 00:19:05,590
Normal. This is what I really wanted.

173
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:08,220
Becoming normal from abnormal.

174
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:11,230
Now, you're cleared of the bribery charges.

175
00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:15,090
The real Baek Joon Soo is back.

176
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:19,480
That Sa Do Chan,

177
00:19:22,310 --> 00:19:25,040
I guess he's gone back to his real job.

178
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:31,130
That guy, he was quite sharp

179
00:19:31,130 --> 00:19:35,380
with ideas that people like us who received public education could never come up with

180
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:39,960
He came up with unimaginable ideas.

181
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:45,190
He was sociable and was even cute when he'd be pretending.

182
00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:47,800
That guy, if he was educated properly

183
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:51,190
and took the bar and became a prosecutor...

184
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:56,040
I'm not sure about this, but I guess he'd have a great record that would be in the top five of the national prosecutors' offices.

185
00:19:58,810 --> 00:20:01,460
Then, I'll take my leave.

186
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:06,860
Okay, okay. So, what I'm saying is that I'm so relieved that everything is back to normal.

187
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:08,480
That's what I mean, got it?

188
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:12,770
I'm passionately welcoming you back. That's what I'm saying.

189
00:20:12,770 --> 00:20:14,850
Do you know what I'm saying right?

190
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,710
All right.

191
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:37,290
Deputy Prosecutor.

192
00:20:37,290 --> 00:20:39,210
Yes, why?

193
00:20:39,210 --> 00:20:42,520
You know the case where a pregnant woman was used as a drug mule? 
  Mule: Slang that is used to describe a drug smuggler 

194
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:43,620
Yes, why?

195
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:46,100
Why was that case assigned to us?

196
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:51,530
Well, that's because it was a case that Prosecutor Baek had worked on. Chief Prosecutor thought he'd do a good job.

197
00:20:51,530 --> 00:20:55,720
So, he singled Sunbae Baek out and assigned it to him, right?

198
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:57,820
Yes.

199
00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:05,170
You know how we got a warrant for illegal remodeling when we got Mr. Hwang?

200
00:21:05,170 --> 00:21:08,570
That was a brilliant idea that came from me then.

201
00:21:08,570 --> 00:21:11,460
Illegal remodeling. And we were issued the warrant then.

202
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:14,470
But when we arrived, the water in the pool was all drained.

203
00:21:14,470 --> 00:21:17,730
They had already hidden the drugs and were fleeing.

204
00:21:17,730 --> 00:21:19,780
Yes, that's what happened.

205
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:24,190
When we went to the airport to search, it felt as if everyone had already suspected our move.

206
00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:26,980
In the end, we wasted our time.

207
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:28,200
Yes.

208
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,750
What do you think this means?

209
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:38,420
That's right. The chief prosecutor.

210
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:43,320
The one who ordered us to cover up K-Savings Bank manager's death as a suicide through Deputy Chief Prosecutor Jin...

211
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:45,770
Don't you think it was the chief prosecutor?

212
00:21:59,390 --> 00:22:05,550
Prosecutor Oh. If anything about this goes wrong, your life is completely over.

213
00:22:06,290 --> 00:22:10,690
You can never handle this.

214
00:22:10,690 --> 00:22:12,850
I'm going crazy here.

215
00:22:12,850 --> 00:22:16,280
Don't do it. That's an order.

216
00:22:16,870 --> 00:22:20,390
If I am only going to work on things I can handle, I shouldn't have become a prosecutor.

217
00:22:20,390 --> 00:22:24,130
Drugs and murders. They look down on us in the prosecutors' office.

218
00:22:24,130 --> 00:22:27,990
If someone is working with such an organization, whoever that may be...

219
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:34,830
Oh Ha Ra.

220
00:22:35,730 --> 00:22:39,490
This is an order. Don't do it.

221
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:44,450
Because I'll do it.

222
00:22:45,970 --> 00:22:51,020
You, you are doing it under my order.

223
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:54,770
If anything goes wrong, I'll be the one to be blamed.

224
00:22:54,770 --> 00:22:59,350
You took my order and investigated with me.

225
00:22:59,350 --> 00:23:03,010
All right. You conduct the investigation the best way you know how.

226
00:23:03,010 --> 00:23:08,660
The bastards who look down on the prosecutor of Korea, the bastards who shamed the prosecutors of Korea,

227
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:10,890
catch them all.

228
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:16,840
But if anything goes wrong, I'll be responsible.

229
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:20,880
Because it was my order, do you understand?

230
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:23,540
Deputy Prosecutor.

231
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,190
Leave if you understand now.

232
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:31,250
Yes.

233
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:44,140
I respect you.

234
00:23:46,270 --> 00:23:48,840
This is why I'm working as a prosecutor.

235
00:23:56,390 --> 00:24:04,620
You be sure to dig your heels in until the end. At the most critical moment,

236
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:06,790
let's flip things around.

237
00:24:07,790 --> 00:24:09,480
Yes.

238
00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:14,360
Didn't Geum Tae Woong kill the bank manager?

239
00:24:16,010 --> 00:24:19,900
I'll have to meet with Prosecutor Baek Joon Soo.

240
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:23,480
K-Savings Bank. Shouldn't we normalize it?

241
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:26,290
With the shares I have in the bank,

242
00:24:26,290 --> 00:24:34,200
if we combine the shares you all own in the Namsan Club, we can take over the savings bank.

243
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:40,000
I'll revive the bank.

244
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,920
 Stock Transfer Contract 

245
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:57,200
  (The "Governor" bought shares in the bank by borrowing the names of the people who are signing the stock over to Geum) 

246
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:01,530
 Lee Ki Hoon 

247
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:06,800
 Cha Hoon Byeong 

248
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:18,980
Properties under borrowed names belong to you when you're powerful.

249
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:22,860
When you're weak, you lose them all. That's what properties under borrowed names mean.

250
00:25:24,490 --> 00:25:29,520
The bothersome old man. He fell into his own trap.

251
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:36,590
This guy. He scams people with architectural residences. He's evil.

252
00:25:36,590 --> 00:25:37,720
Let's get him first.

253
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:42,210
No. He destroys perfectly fine hospital buildings and

254
00:25:42,210 --> 00:25:46,280
kicks out all the patients to build commercial stores. Let's get him first.

255
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:50,220
Let's decide on the person around our potential for success.

256
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:53,940
The potential for success is important, but the more important things is intel.

257
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:56,510
Get as much as you can.

258
00:25:56,510 --> 00:25:59,660
If someone heard you, they'd think we're in the prosecutors' office.

259
00:26:00,950 --> 00:26:03,050
Sounds like the prosecutors are having a meeting.

260
00:26:03,050 --> 00:26:05,750
Why? Do you want to become a prosecutor again?

261
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:11,590
I did become a prosecutor somehow, but there's no way I'd be a prosecutor ever again in my lifetime.

262
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,450
Are you really going to do it?

263
00:26:18,450 --> 00:26:21,640
Please keep our investigation a secret.

264
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:24,730
Lee Gi Roo? Are you talking about the general secretary of the Democratic National Party?

265
00:26:24,730 --> 00:26:27,750
Yes. Please monitor Lee Gi Roo's surroundings.

266
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:31,150
- Every little detail. 
 - Okay.

267
00:26:31,150 --> 00:26:33,320
Will you be able to handle it?

268
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:35,590
Prosecutor Oh, you have a heart of steel.

269
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:38,000
The problem is that it beats too fast.

270
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,340
This. It's perfect. I don't see anything big.

271
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:44,110
You'll find something if you dig.

272
00:26:44,110 --> 00:26:46,730
This, keep this as a secret from Prosecutor Oh.

273
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:48,630
Prosecutor Oh, here you go.

274
00:26:48,630 --> 00:26:52,130
This, keep this as a secret from Sunbae Baek.

Hey, Frivolous. Meet me.

302
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:03,820
Should I put them away for public indecency?

303
00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:05,590
Let's go.

304
00:29:08,930 --> 00:29:12,130
Geez, how come Frivolous isn't here yet?

305
00:29:19,630 --> 00:29:21,470
Sunbae.

306
00:29:26,870 --> 00:29:28,200
