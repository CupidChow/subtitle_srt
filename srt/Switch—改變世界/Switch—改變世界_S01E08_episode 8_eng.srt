1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:02,490
- How much is this honey rice cake? 
 - 3,000 won.

2
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:05,910
- 3,000 won? Give me this one. 
 - Okay. Just a moment.

3
00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:16,260
 Would you want to become a con artist?
 

4
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:19,570
 I like you, Dad, but I don't like that you're a con artist. 

5
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:22,330
 Hey, there's no good or bad in occupations.
 

6
00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:24,600
 I'll never become a con artist. 

7
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:29,000
 - Then what do you want to become? 
- A prosecutor. Someone who catches the bad guys. 

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,190
 Whoa. Let's go. 

9
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:38,250
- Thank you. 
- Have a good day.

10
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:48,550


11
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:17,210
I'm uneasy about the fact that there is a problem with our methods.

12
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:22,260
But for now, I think it's right to catch them first.

13
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:26,320
What? You changed your mind.

14
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:31,080
I've been thinking about what Prosecutor Oh Ha Ra has been saying.

15
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:36,930
If we're going to be punished, it's okay to delay it for a while.

16
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:39,350
But I'm a con artist.

17
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:45,030
Our upright prosecutor, do you think you can work with a con artist?

18
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:53,050
I  already know. You're the only one who can play my role right now.

19
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,530
With all due respect, I'm asking you for this favor.

20
00:02:05,050 --> 00:02:11,880
Well, when you're making such a wholehearted request,  I guess it's not good manners for me to keep refusing.

21
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:22,060
It looks nice to see you two on the same page.

22
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:26,030
To signify that, why don't you guys shake on it?

23
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,430
Let's hear your briefing first.

24
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:54,810
I have to know about the investigation and how you conducted it for me be a good relief pitcher.

25
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:02,860
 One year earlier 

26
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:06,530
 Yoon Tae Won, son-in-law of Lee Gil Ho, leader of the Democratic Justice Party. 

27
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:09,590
 Yeom Gi Seo, the grandson of the founder of Daebang Group. 

28
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:13,500
 The former president's son Yeong Jin Yeong. 

29
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:19,490
 We began our investigation from the report that they threw drug parties with models and actresses. 

30
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:30,590
 - Who are you? 
 - Detectives. We're conducting a search. Step aside. 

31
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:34,060
 Step aside! 

32
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:36,800
 What's going on? 

33
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:40,680
 Hey, hey, wake up! Wake up! Let's get out of here. 

34
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:44,320
 Hey, hurry! Hey, hurry! 

35
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:47,920
 Hey! Park Yeong Jin! Hey! Hey, Park Yeong Jin! 

36
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,820
 Get all the drugs, quick! 

37
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:54,100
 Come on. Hurry up and come out! 

38
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:57,550
 Get down! 

39
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:21,750
 They're not here.  
By the time we got there, we only found diplomat Park Yeong Jin.

40
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:27,780
We found out that Park Yeong Jin had personally brought in drugs, using his diplomatic pouch,

41
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:32,300
under the order of someone named "Brown Bear."

42
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:59,880
A diplomatic pouch is  so convenient.

43
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:04,450
To be able to bring in stuff like this without going through customs.

44
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,850
Next time, how about you bring tons of this inside a sculpture?

45
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:15,040
Well, I'm doing this because the higher-ups have ordered me to do this.

46
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:21,080
I heard the boss' name is Brown Bear?

47
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:24,620
You don't need to know.

48
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:44,560
As soon as we found this out, Park Yeong Jin was found dead in prison.

49
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:49,040
He left a suicide note saying he's killing himself due to coercive interrogation.

50
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:54,500
It was definitely a murder. But to hold him responsible for that, Sunbae was demoted to Sokcho.

51
00:05:54,500 --> 00:06:01,500
Since then, Deputy Prosecutor Yang, me, and Sunbae Baek have been secretly investigating this

52
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:04,830
without reporting to our superiors.

53
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:10,200
Then, how was Nam Seung Tae able to obtain a video clip of Brown Bear?

54
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:17,560
Seung Tae, my life is on the line in this thing.

55
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:20,010
Please keep it safe for me.

56
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:22,390
  They were friends. 

57
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:25,820
 Park Yeong Jin had given it to Nam Seung Tae. 

58
00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:33,760
Drug smuggling through the use of diplomatic pouches is being continued.

59
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:59,090
 Diplomatic Pouch Republic of Korea 

60
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:19,450
I'm Prosecutor Baek Joon Soo from the Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office, Criminal Investigation Division 6.

61
00:07:19,450 --> 00:07:22,320
Would you open the trunk of your car, please? We need to check it.

62
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:24,890
Who do you think you are? Do you know who I am?

63
00:07:24,890 --> 00:07:26,560
You're Diplomat Cha Myeong Soo, right?

64
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:29,010
What are you trying to do now when you already know?

65
00:07:29,010 --> 00:07:31,980
I ask for your cooperation since we're both civil servants.

66
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:48,170
This is the diplomatic pouch. As a prosecutor, don't you know about the Vienna Convention?

67
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:49,990
No one can just open it.

68
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:53,860
I am well aware. Still, I need to check it.

69
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:24,150
It's not in here.

70
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:30,890
You'd better be prepared. I won't let this go.

71
00:08:55,810 --> 00:08:58,140
Do you know how upset the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is?

72
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:00,810
They were calling for immediate disciplinary action against you.

73
00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:03,650
I calmed them down for now saying I'll check out what happened.

74
00:09:03,650 --> 00:09:05,900
Thank you.

75
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:08,860
- Deputy Prosecutor Yang. 
 - Yes.

76
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:10,760
How are you managing your people?

77
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:16,930
Well, as for me, I'm in opposition to them, but these guys, their convictions are driving them.

78
00:09:16,930 --> 00:09:21,150
It's not like I can suppress hoobaes who are so ambitious. And if we can find something, it'll be big.

79
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:27,090
Chief Prosecutor, I still firmly believe that the drugs are being smuggled through diplomatic pouches.

80
00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:30,060
- Please let us investigate. 
 - You have evidence?

81
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:32,900
I need a warrant to bring in the evidence.

It's a search warrant.

97
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:34,010
What?

00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:52,720
What is this?

101
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,050
It's something called Prik Khing.

102
00:10:54,050 --> 00:10:55,650
Is it a new type of drug?

103
00:10:55,650 --> 00:10:59,440
That's extremely spicy.   Thai chili and ginger  

104
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:15,480
The restroom!

105
00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:25,860
- Are you okay? 
- No, I'm not. I was really shocked.

106
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:28,800
I think I need to go to the hospital real quick.

107
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,340
It doesn't call for a hospital visit—

108
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:35,440
I'm allergic to spicy food. Can't you see how swollen it is?

109
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,110
It looks like it's alright.

110
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:39,910
With a job like mine, do you know how important my tongue is?

111
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:45,590
Anyway, I'll be right back. Prosecutor Oh, be sure to go through everything. Got it?

112
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,600
Hey!

113
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:55,150

00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,720
 Who are you? 

117
00:12:51,490 --> 00:12:53,250
 Your dad? 

118
00:12:54,950 --> 00:12:57,320
 Don't you know where your dad went? 

119
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:07,260
 If you buy me some black bean noodles, I'll tell you. 

120
00:13:14,950 --> 00:13:19,650
 I'm someone who's close to your dad. 

121
00:13:19,650 --> 00:13:22,210
 I came here out of concern. 

122
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:26,440
 Do you really not know where he is? 

123
00:13:27,510 --> 00:13:30,450
 He hasn't been home for a week. 

124
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:37,870
 My dad... Please help me find my dad. 

125
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,640
Prosecutor Baek Joon Soo?

126
00:13:57,540 --> 00:14:01,230
I'm Prosecutor Baek Joon Soo. Nice to meet you.

127
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:24,000
The paintings have been influenced by Kandinsky.

128
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:29,540
You know a lot about art, Prosecutor.

129
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:34,420
Well, I just picked it up here and there since I deal with lots of people in my line of work.

130
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:39,360
I see. Is there a particular painter you like?

131
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,170
Mozart.

132
00:14:42,410 --> 00:14:46,220
Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.

133
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:52,130
You have a great sense of humor, Prosecutor.

134
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:53,800
No.

135
00:14:53,800 --> 00:15:01,260
When I hear Mozart's Requiem, I draw a picture of a man who is dying painfully.

136
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:05,400
Would you like some tea?

137
00:15:07,650 --> 00:15:10,870
I said this to the inspector when he came to visit me last time.

138
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:17,730
Seeing that you came to visit me personally, Sa Ma... Was it Sa Ma Cheon?

139
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:21,990
That person must be really important.

140
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:27,590
It's not that important. I heard he was an infamous con artist. I was just wondering if I can find anything through him.

141
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:34,850
By chance, have you met Sa Ma Cheon in person?

142
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:37,720
Would a detective have any reason to meet up with a con artist?

143
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:40,580
I've only seen his picture on a wanted list.

144
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:45,430
 I'm close to your dad. 

145
00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:48,020
 I came out of concern for him. 

146
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:52,320
 You really don't know where he went? 

147
00:16:09,650 --> 00:16:13,450
I play it alone when I'm bored. Do you like to play Janggi?

148
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:17,480
 Janggi:  a Korean game like chess 

149
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:27,600
You want to give up your rook and take my knight instead, huh?

150
00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:49,960
If you had come this way, it would've been a check.

151
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:55,670
The beauty of playing Janggi is to slowly close in on the king.

152
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:01,740
I've definitely met my match.

153
00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:07,720
Then should we use this opportunity to get closer?

154
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:11,590
Then, let's meet often.

155
00:17:25,950 --> 00:17:28,740
Why do I have to get off work just to come here?

156
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:32,520
It's not like I have two jobs or that I get overtime.

157
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:34,750
Hey, I'm a man with simple dreams

158
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:39,540
to sit around and enjoy dinner with my family. Is that too much to ask?

159
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:42,440
If that was your goal, you shouldn't have become a prosecutor to begin with.

160
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:43,970
Hey, you!

161
00:17:43,970 --> 00:17:46,480
Hey, do you know how lofty my goals are?

162
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:51,520
The world where the policemen and firemen are not so busy. The world where the prosecutors go home early. Such a great world!

163
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:55,220
That's why we're working so hard to create a world like that.

164
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:59,250
I'm saying I believe such a world will exist someday and am starting to adjust to it in advance.

165
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:03,030
Believing is the reality of what you wish for. Got it, got it, got it?

166
00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:05,880
Ah, yes. I had no idea you had such a deep intention.

167
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:07,470
Geez.

168
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,720
Wow, confuses me every time I see them.

169
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:16,770
Prosecutor Baek.

170
00:18:16,770 --> 00:18:20,950
So, in any case, are the drugs going to be discovered?

171
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:23,620
You won't find any at the Incheon International Airport.

172
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:26,570
What is he saying right now?

173
00:18:26,570 --> 00:18:31,110
The warrant was fake, to plug up a hole.

174
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:32,480
A hole?

175
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:37,660
"Gyoto Sam Gol." A smart rabbit digs three holes.

176
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:41,600
If we plug up other holes, they'll come out through the remaining hole.

177
00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:51,610
Those prosecutor kiddos. I heard they went through the airport.

178
00:18:51,610 --> 00:18:54,530
We were alerted in advance, so nothing happened.

179
00:18:54,530 --> 00:18:57,730
But since we can't continue to bring in the goods, there's a problem with our supply.

180
00:18:57,730 --> 00:19:01,850
It's coming through the safest and biggest hole. What are you worried about?

181
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:06,130
The price will jump, too. It's all good.

182
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,330
Baek Joon Soo.

183
00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:17,330
Be sure to keep him in check.

184
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:21,020
Baek Joon Soo won't be able to do anything this time.

185
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:22,580
Okay.

186
00:19:31,930 --> 00:19:37,240
 President Kang Han Jip returns today from touring South America. 

187
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:42,950
The President? Are you saying you're going to search through the President's motorcade?

188
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:47,270
The last hole that I had mentioned. It's Air Force One.

189
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:48,930
Heol.

190
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:55,570
The diplomats must've been alerted in advance that we had search warrants.

191
00:19:55,570 --> 00:19:59,350
Then, when would they bring in the goods?

192
00:19:59,350 --> 00:20:05,580
The safest and biggest hole. It's Air Force One.

193
00:20:06,390 --> 00:20:08,550
That's true.

194
00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:12,630
There's no way a search warrant would be issued. And even if we get a warrant,

195
00:20:12,630 --> 00:20:15,850
how can we search through the President's motorcade?

196
00:20:17,530 --> 00:20:21,280
If we can just find the drugs first, the rest we can handle.

197
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:25,470
The problem is how to stop the presidential motorcade.

198
00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:28,490
That's what I'm saying.

199
00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:32,920
This is a great chance for us to catch Brown Bear.

200
00:20:35,650 --> 00:20:41,600
I mean, that is true, but we don't have a way. A way.

201
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:45,330
It's possible.

202
00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:52,930
Sa Do Chan with so many tricks up your sleeve. You set this one up.

203
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:44,550
It looks like it's an emergency situation. Let them go.

204
00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:47,150
I understand.

205
00:21:47,150 --> 00:21:49,140
Stop the car.

206
00:22:12,530 --> 00:22:17,790
The last time the President finished an out of town event when an ambulance appeared from behind,

207
00:22:17,790 --> 00:22:21,160
he had to pull over his motorcade.

208
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:25,590
With this, we should be able to stop his motorcade.

209
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:30,880
For me, I think using an ambulance for things like this goes against life ethics and moral conscience—

210
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,540
No, no, no.

211
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:37,150
Not a real ambulance. There's vehicle that we use for our plans.

212
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:11,680
I am the chief secretary. Who are you people?

213
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:14,690
I'm Prosecutor Oh Ha Ra from the Seoul Central Prosecutor's Office, Criminal Investigation  Division 6.

214
00:23:14,690 --> 00:23:16,910
Prosecutor Baek Joon Soo.

215
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:22,770
But ...

216
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:28,860
What's the matter?

217
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:32,830
Yes. They received a report about drugs and came to check it out.

218
00:23:32,830 --> 00:23:36,590
I'm Prosecutor Oh Ha Ra from the Seoul Central Prosecutor's Office of Criminal Investigation Division 6.

219
00:23:36,590 --> 00:23:39,460
This is Prosecutor Baek Joon Soo.

220
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:42,190
What kind of situation is this? Do you have a warrant?

221
00:23:42,190 --> 00:23:44,800
According to the Criminal Procedure Code Article 216, clause 3, in emergency cases,

222
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:48,080
we can do a search without a warrant and—

223
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:49,550
These people really...

224
00:23:49,550 --> 00:23:51,150
Wait a second.

225
00:23:53,690 --> 00:23:56,010
Go ahead.

226
00:23:56,010 --> 00:23:59,580
I mean Mr. President, we don't have much time left.

227
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:01,390
Please ignore them.

228
00:24:01,390 --> 00:24:05,670
If there's an illegal act going on, an investigation should be done no matter what status.

229
00:24:05,670 --> 00:24:11,300
You said you were Prosecutors Baek Joon Soo and Oh Ha Ra, right? Prosecutors, I applaud your determination.

230
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:13,340
I mean, still, Mr. President...

231
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:17,840
This is the base from which a transparent government can be established.

232
00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:24,740
Prosecutor, something big happened.

233
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:27,870
- What is it? 
- Prosecutor Baek caused a grand accident.

234
00:24:27,870 --> 00:24:30,070
Accident?

235
00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:31,480
 This is a special news report. 

236
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:36,590
 The prosecutors stopped the President's motorcade as they were returning to the Blue House from an out-of-town visit. 

237
00:24:36,590 --> 00:24:39,670
 According to the prosecutors, they have received a report that 

238
00:24:39,670 --> 00:24:42,340
 drugs are being carried within the motorcade. 

239
00:24:43,430 --> 00:24:46,080
I will meet with Chief Yang right away.

240
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:01,080
Chief Yang!

241
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:03,060
Where did he go?

242
00:25:05,990 --> 00:25:09,670
 Equipment Closet 

243
00:25:09,670 --> 00:25:14,990
Even if it doesn't come out, if it doesn't show up, it has nothing to do with me.

244
00:25:14,990 --> 00:25:16,890
That's right.

245
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:18,770
Please, God.

246
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,330
 Diplomatic Pouch Republic of Korea Seoul 

247
00:25:51,770 --> 00:25:54,870
Prosecutor, only this truck is left to check.

248
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:37,420
There is nothing.

249
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:40,200
Please evacuate.

250
00:26:43,930 --> 00:26:48,870
What is this chaos in front of these reporters? How are you going to settle the affair?

251
00:26:48,870 --> 00:26:50,570
We respectfully apologize.

252
00:26:50,570 --> 00:26:53,730
I'll take responsibility for today.

253
00:26:53,730 --> 00:26:56,310
Of course, you have to.

254
00:26:56,310 --> 00:26:59,250
You people, make sure you prepare to take off your gown.

255
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:02,350
Chief, I will handle the rest.

256
00:27:02,350 --> 00:27:05,220
What are you doing? Let's get moving quickly.

257
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:08,230
Wait a second.

258
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:24,310
 Did you find anything? 

259
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:25,150
 Cha Myeong Soo 

260
00:27:25,150 --> 00:27:27,380
 No, it's just ordinary everyday things. 

261
00:27:30,510 --> 00:27:35,630
 Hyung, but there was someone that he contacted quite often. 

262
00:27:35,630 --> 00:27:36,670
 Who? 

263
00:27:36,670 --> 00:27:38,550
 Choi Sang Hyeon. 

264
00:27:39,810 --> 00:27:42,500
 Choi Sang Hyeon 

265
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:09,890

267
00:28:56,060 --> 00:28:57,930
What is that?

268
00:28:57,930 --> 00:28:59,490
It's here, it's here.

269
00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:02,690
What is that?

270
00:29:11,010 --> 00:29:14,230
So the drugs have been uncovered!

271
00:29:30,630 --> 00:29:37,630

277

 Diplomat Choi San Hyeon was captured by the prosecutors at the scene of the crime. 

278
00:29:58,030 --> 00:30:00,520
 This case, putting the prosecutor name on the line... 

279
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:03,510
  Doesn't Do Chan look like real prosecutor and not just an avatar? 

280
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:06,620
 I think Sa Do Chan is fully capable of doing well. 

281
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:08,060
 You didn't tell him yet? 

282
00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:09,890
 When I'm ready, I will tell them. 

283
00:30:09,890 --> 00:30:11,930
 We have to crush them or something! 

284
00:30:11,930 --> 00:30:13,190
  I understand. 

285
00:30:13,190 --> 00:30:16,520
 I will make Prosecutor Jeong Do Yeong a friend. 

286
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:20,100
 That's what I'm curious about, the real target that Sa Do Chan is aiming for.  

287
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:20,870
 Brown Bear 

288
00:30:20,870 --> 00:30:23,360
 I've searched and wandered for 20 years.
