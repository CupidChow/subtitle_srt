1
00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:12,170


2
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:28,130
Why is he stopping?

3
00:00:29,350 --> 00:00:31,410
Go find out.

4
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:39,820
What? What's wrong?

5
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:41,660
Our truck was reported as stolen.

6
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:43,490
- Reported as stolen? 
 -  Yes.

7
00:00:43,490 --> 00:00:46,480
What are you talking about, Punk!

8
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:55,810
Jeon In Tae?

9
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:02,340
Oh, hey! Hey!

10
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:04,700
Get him! Get him!

11
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:28,720
Why isn't he answering?

12
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:37,000
Inspector Go, is there Sa Do... Sunbae Baek is there, right?

13
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,860
No, I haven't seen him for a while.

14
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:42,450
If you see him, call me.

15
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:44,500
 Yes, of course. 

16
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:58,400
Sa Do Chan, if you're playing around this time too,I won't let you off easy.

17
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:09,560
Honey, maybe we should've given some offering when were at the Buddhist temple last week.

18
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:13,010
Geez, I tried to save a few bucks.

19
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:15,610
That bothers me so much.

20
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:18,080
Huh? Would you?

21
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:24,340
Then, write down "May our wish come true" and offer around 30,000 won.

22
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:26,930
Thank you. Yes.

23
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:31,480
Would three be enough?

24
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:34,440
Should I have given about five?

25
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:45,010
Where did they disappear to?

26
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,050
How could he do this?

27
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:26,890
How could he do this!

28
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:56,640
Sunbae, I've been fooled.

29
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,720
Fooled? What do you mean?

30
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:03,300
I was totally had by that con artist Sa Do Chan!

31
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:09,100
The drugs... were his goal.

32
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:14,130
In the end, we were fooled?

33
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:15,870
What do we do now?

34
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:20,310
What do I need to do now?

35
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:23,310
 I was following them! 

36
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:27,510
They all disappeared with the truck in the middle of the road.

37
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:29,870
Go Ha Ra, focus.

38
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:33,560
Look around you.  Look at everything.

39
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:36,550
There is nothing.

40
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,240
There's nothing.

41
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:49,870
 Men always stab you in the back the moment you start to trust them. Be careful! 

42
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:13,010
 Everything changes, but nothing changes. 

43
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:38,840
Sa do Chan. Did Sa Do Chan come?

44
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:44,110
How about Director Bong? In Tae and Eun Ji?

45
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:46,470
They weren't here all day.

46
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:52,330
They got us.

47
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:56,480
For real.

48
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:05,600
 Dongyeong Mills 

49
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:11,980
This...

50
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:17,710
Let's begin.

51
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:42,370
Mr. Hwang, how did you manage things?

52
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:45,340
I told you in advance that they'll come to do search and seizure,

53
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:47,750
and you couldn't protect that?

54
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:51,320
As I told you, before the prosecutors arrived

55
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:54,200
I moved them into a truck.

56
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:56,300
But...

57
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:58,740
But... what?

58
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:02,450
They stole the entire truck.

59
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:07,370
You want me to believe that nonsense?

60
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:09,290
Mr. Hwang, are you kidding me right now?

61
00:07:09,290 --> 00:07:13,670
I'm going crazy, too! Who the hell is playing this joke?

62
00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:18,070
This is all because of that punk Jo Seong Do.

63
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:23,160
Because that punk made his move, the police and the Prosecutors' Office is sniffing around!

64
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:29,780
President, it's time for you to go to the Senior Center event.

65
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:32,300
Shut up. You think I'm in the state of mind to go to a place like that?

66
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:36,210
All the TV stations and reporters are in place.

67
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:38,080
Go.

68
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,870
CEO, the current situation is...

69
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:44,210
The city council... You think we want you to become a member for your happiness?

70
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:50,860
Pay attention especially at a time like this and don't make any mistakes in front of the reporters.

71
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:59,970
 Sharing Love with Dongyeong Mills 

72
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:11,540
Thank you, thank you.

73
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:17,590
Sit. Please sit down.

74
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:19,860
Thank you.

75
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:25,540
It's a small token, but for you elders

76
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:28,780
Dongyeong Mills prepared a gift.

77
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:34,860
Take them home and make some noodles.

78
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:39,580
And make some dumplings. Wouldn't that be nice?

79
00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:56,880
His cell phone must be turned off.

80
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,340
It's not coming up at all.

81
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,800
 Sa Do Chan 

82
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,980
  The phone is turned off. You'll be connected to voicemail.  

83
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:12,310
Where did he hide?

84
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,230
It's here!

85
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:17,950
Where is this?

86
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:25,970
 Dongyeong Mills donated 100 bags  

87
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:35,660
 We, the Dongyeong Mills... No, no, no. 

88
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:43,000
I, Hwang Beom Do, will work hard to serve you elders.

89
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:48,300
If you need anything, please tell us any time.

90
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:50,570
Thank you.

91
00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:53,220
Thank you, thank you.

92
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:55,980
Are these good quality?

93
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:59,020
Just because you're giving them out to old people for free...

94
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:03,510
You didn't bring expired products, did you?

95
00:10:05,330 --> 00:10:10,260
Grandpa, we ground up this flour today at our company.

96
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:12,770
You'll know right away when you taste it.

97
00:10:12,770 --> 00:10:17,080
Well, I'll know when I eat it.

98
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:20,470
Where is the knife?

99
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:22,190
Because of people like him,

100
00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:26,420
our Korea becomes more upright. Don't you think so?

101
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,200
Yes, yes. Sure.

102
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:35,520
You have to be sure.

103
00:10:39,010 --> 00:10:42,380
Relax. Prosecutor Oh, your heart is still beating fast.

104
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:46,340
Let go. To trust someone like you even for 0.00001%...

105
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:49,830
You trusted me that much? I'm touched.

106
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:54,970
I prepared you an event. It's going to begin now.

107
00:10:54,970 --> 00:10:59,070
Watch it and if you still want to hit me after that, go ahead.

108
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:04,650
 Multipurpose Flour 

109
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:16,940
This isn't flour.

110
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:19,030
Huh? It's not? What is he talking about?

111
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:22,410
Old man, it's not flour? How could that be?

112
00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:23,980
Here.

113
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,970
Mr. Hwang, what is it?

114
00:11:31,970 --> 00:11:33,830
Ah, nothing.

115
00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:34,770
It's drugs.

116
00:11:34,770 --> 00:11:35,680
What? Drugs?

117
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,160
No, it's not it.

118
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:40,710
It's premium quality drugs.

119
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:45,300
What do you mean drugs? Nonsense. It's nothing.

120
00:11:46,690 --> 00:11:49,740
C'mon.

121
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:52,600
No, no.

122
00:11:57,580 --> 00:12:01,630
No. It's not drugs.

123
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:04,810
No...

124
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:09,300
How about it? You like it?

125
00:12:23,170 --> 00:12:25,270
- Stand up. 
 - What?

126
00:12:25,270 --> 00:12:27,020
Stand up!

127
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:29,530
What? Let go!

128
00:12:29,530 --> 00:12:34,060
There's no way drugs would come here!

129
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:35,940
Get in!

130
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:38,750
How did you know?

131
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:43,830
I was following them, but they suddenly disappeared.

132
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:58,950
That blue trailer. That was you?

133
00:12:58,950 --> 00:13:02,100
You were only following the orange cargo truck.

134
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:05,920
People always see what they want to see.

135
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:10,410
Your facial expression, it was quite a sight.

136
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,940
It really hurts. You're going to break it.

137
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:18,570
I can't live up to my full life span.

138
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:24,080
I'm always falling for it!

139
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:27,060
Let's go.

140
00:13:28,590 --> 00:13:30,300
Let's go.

141
00:13:31,690 --> 00:13:33,130
Breaking news!

142
00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:34,950
Breaking news?

143
00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:37,600
What, what? What is it?

144
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,810
What is it?

145
00:13:39,810 --> 00:13:41,580
Let us know, too.

146
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:43,670
 This afternoon, President Hwang Beom Do of Dongyeong Mills... 

147
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:46,510
 was arrested for possession of illegal drugs. 

148
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:49,480
 President Hwang Beom Do who entered the election for Banpo City Council, 

149
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:52,370
 at a senior center event right before the election, 

150
00:13:52,370 --> 00:13:56,540
  was arrested on site for mistaking drugs for flour and donating it to the center. 

151
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:59,120
 Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office Criminal Division 6 who were dispatched,  

152
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:03,110
  arrested Hwang Beom Do on site and are currently transporting him to the Prosecutors' Office. 

153
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:05,900
 "City council candidate Hwang Beom Do revealed to be responsible for smuggling new drugs!" 

154
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:14,850
Yes! Yes, yes, yes!

155
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:16,590
Yes!

156
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:21,340
Yes!

157
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:25,720
What's your reason for not taking the drugs?

158
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,080
I don't do drugs.

159
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:31,830
If you took it, it would've been a fortune. Wasn't that your goal?

160
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:34,610
What do you want to know?

161
00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:35,840
Truth.

162
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:39,900
There's this saying, "The truth shall set you free,"

163
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:44,310
but before that, it will piss you off.

164
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:48,400
I'm giving you heartfelt advice.

165
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:54,000
No matter how many times you ask me, you won't get any truth out of me.

166
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,070
One thing is for sure.

167
00:14:58,070 --> 00:15:02,560
Sa Do Chan, you're looking at something distant.

168
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:06,640
For now, let's go there together.

169
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:09,780
Step aside.

170
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:10,940
Is it true?

171
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:13,160
Please tell us!

172
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:16,050
Is it true?

173
00:15:16,050 --> 00:15:18,060
Just a moment.

174
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:19,340
Please tell us!

175
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:21,970
One word please!

176
00:15:21,970 --> 00:15:23,150
Please step aside.

177
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:24,550
Please tell us.

178
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:25,870
Is that true?

179
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:28,280
Please tell us.

180
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:30,910
Ahjussi.

181
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:33,100
Kiddo, how are you?

182
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:35,550
You seem much better. I'm so glad.

183
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:40,860
We came here to thank you. I heard you caught the guy who made me do that.

184
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:48,370
On top of that, thank you so much for taking care of the hospital bill.

185
00:15:48,370 --> 00:15:53,540
You saved our lives. Thank you so much.

186
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:55,000
Did I do that?

187
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:59,830
I usually let my right hand forget what my left hand does.

188
00:15:59,830 --> 00:16:02,280
You caught him, right, Ahjussi?

189
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:05,180
That bad guy who made my mom sick.

190
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:08,070
Yeah, this prosecutor ahjussi caught him.

191
00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:12,130
Then, I'll become a great prosecutor like him.

192
00:16:12,130 --> 00:16:16,100
Don't ever do that. It's really no fun.

193
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,880
Don't do it?

194
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:21,490
No. Grow up fast and become a great prosecutor, okay?

195
00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:25,650
But you must become a great prosecutor, okay?

196
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,170
Thanks.

197
00:16:38,170 --> 00:16:41,570
I didn't do it to hear thanks.

198
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:46,610
I was thanking that ahjumma and that kid for surviving.

199
00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:50,680
What did I say? I was talking to that kid, too.

200
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:59,080
The LSDT discovered inside Choi Sang Hyeon's diplomat pouch and the LSDT that came out of your flour bags.

201
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:02,090
An analysis says they're the same.

202
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:07,360
It's a photo that was discovered in the home of the diplomat Choi Sang Hyeon.

203
00:17:08,150 --> 00:17:12,580
There's no exit.  You're at a "dead end."

204
00:17:18,110 --> 00:17:21,580
 Mr. Hwang, we have an urgent message from the Prosecutors' Office. 

205
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:23,870
 They're going to issue a search and seizure warrant soon. 

206
00:17:23,870 --> 00:17:28,420
 Hurry up and transport the items hiding in the villa pool to the Jecheon storage. 

207
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:31,340
 The pool... Ah, yes. 

208
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:33,580
 I'll tell them right away. 

209
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:37,790
 And one thing... 

210
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:40,530
 CEO Geum has ordered something. 

211
00:17:40,530 --> 00:17:50,590
 If things go awry, just in case, you'll become the Brown Bear. 

212
00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:53,680
 Brown Bear. 

213
00:17:54,800 --> 00:18:00,350
 You sent your daughter to Vancouver, Canada to study abroad, right? You should think of her safety. 

214
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:02,600
 You should do that. 

215
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:16,640
Now that it's come to this, I'll confess everything.

216
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:23,010
The one who is responsible for transporting drugs through a diplomat pouch

217
00:18:23,010 --> 00:18:24,940
is me.

218
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:35,250
Hwang Beom Do. Are you the one who ordered the attack on Prosecutor Baek Joon Soo?

219
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:38,970
Yes, that's right. I ordered it.

220
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:45,210
Did you order the murder of diplomats Park Yeong Jin and Nam Seung Tae?

221
00:18:45,210 --> 00:18:48,170
Yes, I did.

222
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:55,580
Hwang Beom Do. Your nickname is...

223
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:57,460
Brown Bear.

224
00:19:00,910 --> 00:19:03,470
Everyone calls me Brown Bear.

225
00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:06,270
For my physique.

226
00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:21,540
If so, what did you do with that video clip?

227
00:19:22,570 --> 00:19:26,240
A v-video clip?

228
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:31,270
The video clip from the Czech Cultural Center.

229
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:33,880
There's no way you wouldn't know that.

230
00:19:39,850 --> 00:19:42,540
The Czech Cultural Center?

231
00:19:43,730 --> 00:19:46,970
I got rid of the video clip.

232
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:09,970
If he's the real Brown Bear, there's no way he wouldn't know the Spain Cultural Center.

233
00:20:09,970 --> 00:20:13,430
But why would he say he's Brown Bear himself?

234
00:20:13,430 --> 00:20:17,590
He must be being blackmailed to say he's Brown Bear if he's caught.

235
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:20,800
His life is in danger, too. 
  Ministry of Justice 

236
00:20:22,050 --> 00:20:26,300
If you stare at him like that, would you know who the real Brown Bear is?

237
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:28,860
Because I'm curious.

238
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:34,590
Right. Eyes look to where the curiosity is.

239
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:39,840
People look for what they want to find out.

240
00:20:49,170 --> 00:20:51,810
You know that kind of business that is, right?

241
00:20:51,810 --> 00:20:54,700
Even after bribing lobbyists everywhere and

242
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:58,260
giving out tons of scholarships to the kids of Namsan Club guys,

243
00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:01,800
it used to leave me a fortune of profit.

244
00:21:03,650 --> 00:21:06,400
You ruined all that.

245
00:21:14,070 --> 00:21:19,580
Yeah, the sun comes in nicely in this room.

246
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:22,030
So, from here to there,

247
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:26,810
that's why I have them in a row by numbers.

248
00:21:26,810 --> 00:21:30,870
First place, second place, third place.

249
00:21:30,870 --> 00:21:35,040
These all are in order.

250
00:21:39,290 --> 00:21:45,570
Is this the orchid that you sent me on my birthday last year?

251
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:46,570
It is.

252
00:21:46,570 --> 00:21:49,170
This guy is very

253
00:21:49,170 --> 00:21:53,230
weak these days.

254
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:56,880
The beauty of a flower will not last ten days.

255
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:00,800
It looks ugly when it withers.

256
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:18,680
Jo Seong Do.

257
00:22:20,650 --> 00:22:24,250
Shouldn't you take care of him first?

258
00:22:29,930 --> 00:22:32,050
That old man!

259
00:22:36,110 --> 00:22:38,390
Are you going to disregard what the Governor said?

260
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:43,110
All this came about because Jo Seong Do got caught selling drugs in Hongdae.

261
00:22:43,110 --> 00:22:48,820
If you leave him alone even after the Governor gave him his order, he'll become an even bigger obstacle for your future.

262
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:51,540
If you don't make your decision now,

263
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:53,780
you'll regret it.

264
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:17,780
Give me some fried dumplings or something.

265
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:21,710
Mr. Jo. it's me. Moon Shik.

266
00:23:21,710 --> 00:23:24,250
Moon Shik... Moon Shik! Hey!

267
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:25,870
Moon Shik!

268
00:23:25,870 --> 00:23:29,690
Moon Shik... How did you come?

269
00:23:30,490 --> 00:23:34,110
I bribed them to see you. I have to tell you something.

270
00:23:34,110 --> 00:23:36,660
Get me out of here.

271
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:39,620
Mr. Hwang got caught with his drugs. It's crazy.

272
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:46,310
They're saying it's all your fault. You might get killed if you're not careful.

273
00:23:46,310 --> 00:23:49,840
Huh? Me?

274
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:59,700
How about if we do this?

275
00:24:01,170 --> 00:24:03,310
What?

276
00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:05,380
Mi Ran.

277
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:11,900
Nice.

278
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:26,380
 Incheon city, Joongu Chinatown, Cheonji Motel Basement Room #7 

279
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:27,970
What's this?

280
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:29,790
What is it?

281
00:24:29,790 --> 00:24:33,390
I don't know. A Chinese restaurant ad?

282
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:40,460
Yes.

283
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:42,230
 You received a text, right? 

284
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:46,780
Someone's life is on the line. Please rescue him quickly.

285
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:50,280
Is this voice phishing? Sure, I'll send you money.

286
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:53,360
How much? Would one billion won suffice?

287
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:55,980
 No. It's not that. 

288
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:58,290
Customer, did I shock you?

289
00:24:58,290 --> 00:25:00,640
 Prosecutor Baek Joon Soo. 

290
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:08,870
You have to rescue him in order to catch Brown Bear you're looking for.

291
00:25:33,390 --> 00:25:35,400
