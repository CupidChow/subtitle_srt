1
00:00:04,750 --> 00:00:06,810
How did that happen?

2
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:15,590
What else? Our oppa succeeded again.

3
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:25,510
 Government ID 
 Oh Ha Ra 
 Supreme Prosecutors' Office 

4
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:29,220
I'm sincerely grateful.

5
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:30,820
About what?

6
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:35,060
I'm grateful that you got pretty while I haven't seen you.

7
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:41,710


8
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:44,520
Prosecutor Oh,  I was really glad to see you today.

9
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:49,450
I have an appointment today. I'll buy you dinner some other time.

10
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:51,340
That's where the machines are stored.

11
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:53,180
I know.

12
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:07,020
It doesn't open, huh?

13
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:09,140
It doesn't open.

14
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:20,070
Even if you're that glad to see me, people are watching.

15
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:23,460
I'll confiscate this for now.

16
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:29,050
I'm tearfully glad to see you, Cha Do Chan.

17
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:41,070
Have you ever been in a place like this before? You don't have a criminal record.

18
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:46,230
You know, I think there's been a misunderstanding.

19
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:52,360
Are you thinking of what kind of crimes you committed in your life thus far? One at a time?

20
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:02,070
What's this?

21
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:04,860
How did she know my name?

22
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:12,360
Who the heck is she?

23
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,420
Pass.

24
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:22,720
Pass.

25
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,730
Pass.

26
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:29,530
Wait a minute.

27
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:41,760
I checked with the local police stations. He's quite an infamous conman.

28
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,020
A conman?

29
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:46,280
He has an IQ of 168. He's a genius.

30
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:52,030
He picks out only the ones who can't report him to the police even after being defrauded. He gets them, then disappears like the wind.

31
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:54,420
That's why he doesn't have a criminal record.

32
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:58,540
I like him. He's perfect.

33
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:02,770
Whether you have to coddle him or put handcuffs on him, just bring him to me no matter what.

34
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:04,360
Pardon?

35
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:09,690
I need this man... for sure.

36
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:13,930
Excuse me.

37
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:23,810
Yes, Prosecutor Oh. I found Sa Do Chan.

38
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:26,380
Really? Bring him in right away.

39
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:30,350
Well, he's on his way over there.

40
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:32,010
What?

41
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:36,110
One.

42
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:38,660
Two.

43
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:41,290
How could he look exactly the same?

44
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:45,520
Two and a half of a half of a half, there no such a thing. There's only three.

45
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:49,170
Three.

46
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:51,720
Baek Joon Soo!

47
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:56,810
Sunbae, have you been well?

48
00:03:56,810 --> 00:03:58,830
It's been so long.

49
00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:02,060
Your cheeks got chubbier.

50
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:04,040
Muscles.

51
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:20,160
He looks exactly the same. How could this be?

52
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,550
Hey, do you think there's a birth secret that Prosecutor Baek knows nothing about?

53
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:25,940
Among over 7 billion people living on earth,

54
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:31,710
I heard there are at least seven people who look like me without being my identical twin.

55
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:33,750
It's been proven scientifically.

56
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:39,960
So, you're saying our clean Prosecutor Baek looks like him, of all people?

57
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:44,770
Deputy Prosecutor, this is a calling from God.

58
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:47,710
You said he's a conman.

59
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:50,840
That's what makes him all the more perfect.

60
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:54,560
Look, is anyone there or not?

61
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,280
There is. I know you're there.

62
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:00,660
You know, I'm Prosecutor Baek Joon Soo from the Detective Division 6.

63
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:04,120
The door of the interrogation room got locked while I was conducting my investigation.

64
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:08,320
I feel like you should hurry up and open it up for me.

65
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:13,810
I really can't see at all.

66
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:20,870
Prosecutor Oh, you'll get fired if you're not careful with this.

67
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:23,600
I really don't know. Whatever, whatever, whatever.

68
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,070
You take care of it.

69
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:27,350
Deputy Prosecutor!

70
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:31,690
I knew he'd do this.

71
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:51,270
Look, Prosecutor Oh. You're making a mistake.

72
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:57,060
I don't know what kind of misunderstanding took place, but how could you be so rude to your sunbae?

73
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:59,500
There are so many problems with the prosecutors' office.

74
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:05,130
And also, what did you call me before? Sa... Sa... what? I think you're confusing me with him.

75
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:07,420
You can't do this to your sunbae.

76
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:11,130
I got so pissed that I was going to report you to the Ministry of Supervision, but...

77
00:06:11,130 --> 00:06:14,090
Fine, fine. You can make a mistake in life.

78
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:19,290
Without tolerance, understanding, and sincerity, I'm as good as dead.

79
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:21,520
I'll give you my sincere advice.

80
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,600
You talk of sincerity when you're a lying a**hole?

81
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,750
Give me a break. Do you know where this is?

82
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:27,840
This is a Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office's interrogation room!

83
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:32,770
How dare you pretend to be a prosecutor? You want me to throw you in jail for a criminal offense of impersonating a public official?

84
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:43,150
Prosecutor, your heart is beating too fast.

85
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:45,910
Are you pretending to be a doctor this time?

86
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:51,300
Let's review this strangely tangled situation.

87
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:56,890
Simulacrum. A French philosopher Jean Baudrillard said this.

88
00:06:56,890 --> 00:07:02,620
In the 21st century, the world is racing toward a simulated world where the fake seems to be more real than the real thing itself.

89
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:05,790
As for simulacrum, someone who doesn't exist in reality.

90
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:08,480
It's an artificial object that is make-believe.

91
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:12,850
However, it does not hide the truth.

92
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:15,730
What a bunch of bulls***...

93
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:19,650
Let's make a deal.

94
00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:25,460
You know I'm not Baek Joon Soo, but why did you treat me like Baek Joon Soo earlier?

95
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:33,090
You knew that I'm not the original, but a copy.

96
00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:39,590
Now, we're talking. I like you for being smart.

97
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:46,190
Does that make sense?

98
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:49,000
Are you asking me to be the real prosecutor?

99
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,750
How dare you pretend to be a prosecutor as a conman.

100
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:52,160
You said to be a prosecutor.

101
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:56,980
Who asked you to be a prosecutor? Pretend to be Baek Joon Soo and go pick up something.

102
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:59,950
Now that I see it, you're a crook, too.

103
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:03,500
You're asking me to commit a fraud. Especially inside the prosecutors' office.

104
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,600
Are you crazy? Did I say to do that inside the prosecutors' office?

105
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:09,720
You resemble Sunbae Baek, so I'm asking you to be a stand-in.

106
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:17,530
Not twice. Just once will do.

107
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:18,390
What if I said no?

108
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:22,450
Those guests earlier. Should I call them in again?

109
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:53,590
What if Nam Seung Tae notices it?

110
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:56,460
He met the real Baek Joon Soo before, didn't he?

111
00:08:57,910 --> 00:09:02,490
That guy. He's quite a character.

112
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:11,560
Prosecutor.

113
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:16,410
I heard you got hurt.

114
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:21,050
It wasn't too serious. Just a small car accident.

115
00:09:21,050 --> 00:09:24,890
You seem much happier than before.

116
00:09:24,890 --> 00:09:29,230
Actually, it was a big accident. I almost died.

117
00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:33,830
You know how they say people change when you go through a life and death situation.

118
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,380
Did you bring the item?

119
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,940
 It's in the Spain Cultural Center. 

120
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:53,480
 Spain Cultural Center? 

121
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:56,980
There's a secret safe under the Don Quixote statue.

122
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:58,560
As for the safe combinationâ€”

123
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:01,110
My cousin who works there knows it.

124
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:03,300
He'll let you know if you go there on Saturday around closing time.

125
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:07,240
I sent him your photo.

126
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,690
He said he was going to bring an item. What's with the Spain Cultural Center?

127
00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:16,010
He said he didn't bring it because he was being chased.

128
00:10:16,010 --> 00:10:19,630
But what's inside that?

129
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:23,230
Is it something like a diamond or something?

130
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:31,910
Now, my task is over.

131
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:33,980
Wait a minute.

132
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:38,900
Deputy Prosecutor, why don't you call the hospital? Find out what Sunbae's condition is.

133
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:41,720
Okay, okay. Let's do that.

134
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:46,600
It's me. How is our Prosecutor Baek?

135
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:49,880
Do you think he'd be able to wake up in the next two to three days?

136
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:53,490
All right.

137
00:10:53,490 --> 00:10:56,610
Probably not likely by Saturday.

138
00:10:58,050 --> 00:11:02,290
I'm sorry, but since you're in it, could you do this until Saturday?

139
00:11:02,290 --> 00:11:06,300
Wait. You said not twice, just once.

140
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:13,060
You have a really bad habit of speaking from both sides of your mouth.

141
00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:20,470
This is why the judiciary department is losing the people's trust.

142
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:23,780
I'm extremely sorry about that as well.

143
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:27,380
Hey, Conman! Do it until Saturday or else I'll throw you in jail!

144
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:30,180
Do you have proof that I conned?

145
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:33,200
Then, bring me a warrant!

146
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,160
I did you a favor, how dare you treat me like this...?

147
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:42,550
He's got quite a temper.

148
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:45,280
How could he still go like that?

149
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:54,810
He's coming. He's coming.

150
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:04,410
I have a condition.

151
00:12:04,410 --> 00:12:08,680
Prosecutor Baek Joon Soo. I have to see him with my own eyes.

152
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:13,450
If what you're saying is true, I have to see him for myself.

153
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:19,490
Then, go? Okay, get in. Get in.

154
00:12:33,650 --> 00:12:35,420
Aigoo, Director Hyeon.

155
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:38,700
He really looks exactly like him.

156
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:40,280
Hello.

157
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:51,820
 Do not enter  

158
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,170
Do you believe me now?

159
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:07,080
We can't let the outside world know.

160
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:09,710
I can't explain all that though.

161
00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:23,050
Fine. Let's do it.

162
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:31,500
Seeing someone who looks like me in this condition is swaying my emotions for some reason.

163
00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:39,510
My heart may beat a little slow, but it's not cold.

164
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:47,120
I'm going to play a prosecutor.

165
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,300
- What? 
 - What?

166
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,530
You're going to do the prosecutor cosplay again?

167
00:13:52,530 --> 00:13:56,460
It's dangerous. Dangerous.  You're allergic to prosecutors.

168
00:13:56,460 --> 00:14:00,430
I'm against it, too. How can you trust that sly woman prosecutor to cooperate?

169
00:14:00,430 --> 00:14:02,420
What if she stabs you in the back?

170
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:05,820
Don't worry. If I do some good this time around,

171
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:07,530
wouldn't that be good?

172
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:16,880
Whatever, whatever.

173
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:52,810
All right. Let's say we get the safe combo. How are we going to bring the thing out?

174
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:55,380
Why did he have to put it in a place like that?

175
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:59,530
You can get the warrant and walk in confidently. What's the problem?

176
00:14:59,530 --> 00:15:01,070
We can't get a warrant.

177
00:15:01,070 --> 00:15:04,370
The minute we request a warrant, it will leak.

178
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:07,950
We have to move forward without a sound or rumors.

179
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:11,330
I know guys who are good at that. Should I tell them to steal it?

180
00:15:11,330 --> 00:15:14,850
That's obtaining the evidence illegally. We can't even use that as evidence.

181
00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:18,440
You can't steal, but it has to be admissible as an evidence.

182
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:22,460
Geez, it's like asking me to draw a square-shaped triangle.

183
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:24,430
A prosecutor's job is quite complicated.

184
00:15:24,430 --> 00:15:27,480
That's why we're having a strategy meeting.

185
00:15:32,650 --> 00:15:37,320
We can create a situation where we can enter without a warrant.

186
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:39,340
Without a warrant?

187
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:41,230
Crime scene.

188
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:42,960
 Crime scene: place where crime occurred 

189
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:48,580
Spain Cultural Center. You can turn that place into a crime scene.

190
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,950
Now, first step.

191
00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:54,430
I will go inside the Cultural Center

192
00:15:54,430 --> 00:15:57,220
in the afternoon, confidently.

193
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:01,380
One of the actors on our side acts as an activist against redevelopment.

194
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:04,550
He pretends to be one of the neighborhood residents.

195
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:06,690
I'll blow up the cultural center!

196
00:16:06,690 --> 00:16:09,060
If he creates a ruckus saying he'll blow up the cultural center,

197
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:14,460
since I happen to be at the location, I will get into a fight with the man trying to stop him.

198
00:16:21,070 --> 00:16:22,800
It's a bomb!

199
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:27,150
If the machine that I placed in advance starts to make noises, people will think that it's a bomb.

200
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:31,090
Everyone will run away. At that moment, in order to dispose of the bomb,

201
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:34,430
the police force EOD will be dispatched.

202
00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:36,670
And then!

203
00:16:37,770 --> 00:16:43,210
We coincidentally discover the evidence at the crime scene.

204
00:16:49,030 --> 00:16:51,020
Like this?

205
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:56,680
Bingo.

206
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:58,540
We?

207
00:17:01,810 --> 00:17:08,220
It's an idea that can never come out of someone who studied in a proper school system.

208
00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:23,790
Can you handle this right now?

209
00:17:23,790 --> 00:17:26,980
I have to quit being a prosecutor if I want to do only the things I can handle.

210
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:32,260
Quit? How can you say that so easily? It's because you're young.

211
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:35,760
How about me? What did I do wrong? I have to marry off my daughter.

212
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:38,130
She's in high school.

213
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:43,310
I thought your goal was to become the female prosecutor general.

214
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:48,780
Even if you graduated from an backwater university, you have the highest test score among your colleagues. Are you going to throw all that away?

215
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:51,010
It's not only because of my daughter.

216
00:17:51,010 --> 00:17:54,100
I'm worried for you. That's why I'm saying this.

217
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:58,310
Look. If you get caught with this, getting fired is a given.

218
00:17:58,310 --> 00:18:00,710
You won't be able to even open up a lawyer's office later. Do you know that?

219
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:04,020
Are you listening to me?

220
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:06,360
Yes.

221
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:10,810
Then, can you leave me out tomorrow?

222
00:18:10,810 --> 00:18:12,460
- No, I can't.
 - Darn.

223
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:35,260
 CEO Geum Tae Woong 

224
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:42,860
Did you find Nam Seung Tae?

225
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:44,430
I'm looking for him.

226
00:18:44,430 --> 00:18:49,140
He hasn't come home for a few days. It's hard to track his location since he's using an unregistered phone.

227
00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:55,480
Since Prosecutor Baek is dead, there's not much Nam Seung Tae could do.

228
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:59,990
It's not confirmed yet though, Prosecutor Baek's death.

229
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:05,210
Contact him in any way you can and tell him we'll pay him as much as he wants. So  ask him to hand over the item.

230
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:09,580
Right now, the first thing to do is to catch him. Whether we kill him or not,

231
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:12,950
let's decide that later.

232
00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:15,140
I understand.

233
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:19,320
That item. It can never go to the Prosecutors' Office.

234
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:23,340
We must find it first and get rid of it.

235
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,910
Don't make a mistake.

236
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:57,990
Yeah, Deputy Prosecutor Woo.

237
00:19:57,990 --> 00:20:02,200
What? Why is Chief Prosecutor looking for me?

238
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:04,410
All right, I'll be right there.

239
00:20:04,410 --> 00:20:06,280
Deputy Prosecutor.

240
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:10,360
Are you going to keep doing this?

241
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:21,900
I'm going.

242
00:20:25,370 --> 00:20:27,880
Would it be okay?

243
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:29,530
It has to be.

244
00:20:29,530 --> 00:20:34,600
 Spain Cultural Center 

245
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:44,230
 Five, four, three... 

246
00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:45,830
 Five. 

247
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:11,440
The cultural center that's interfering with the redevelopment...

248
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:14,200
Blow it up! Blow it up!

249
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:18,760
Blow it up! Blow it up! Blow it up!

250
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:21,870
Blow it up! Blow it up!

251
00:21:21,870 --> 00:21:26,290
Blow up the Cultural Center! Blow it up!

252
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:34,710
Who are those guys?

253
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:37,780
- What is it?
 - Hey!

254
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:39,960
Fake prosecutor.

255
00:21:43,090 --> 00:21:44,100
Who are you?

256
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:48,350
President Jo Seong Do sent us. Do you understand now?

257
00:21:50,430 --> 00:21:53,720
The desert island gambling case.

258
00:21:54,690 --> 00:21:59,030
Why don't you smell the incense behind the curtain today?  (It means you're going to die today.) 

259
00:21:59,030 --> 00:22:00,950
Hey, hit him.

260
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:03,710
This punk...

261
00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:15,520
Hey,

262
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,170
Sa Do Chan!

263
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:25,090
What's going on?

264
00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:28,690
Why is it so noisy?

265
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:34,330
-  It's big trouble! Things are turning out weird! 
 -Hey!

266
00:22:37,010 --> 00:22:38,890
Deputy Prosecutor.

267
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:44,560
What do we do...

268
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:46,520
Deputy Prosecutor!

269
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:54,170
This is the Seoul Spain Cultural Center.

270
00:22:54,170 --> 00:22:57,320
It's big trouble! Please hurry up and come!

271
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,230
No!

272
00:23:56,620 --> 00:23:58,490
What's this?

273
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:26,290
Blood pressure 120/80. At this rate, he'll be in shock...

274
00:24:28,690 --> 00:24:31,590
Blood pressure 120/80 is normal, man.

275
00:24:31,590 --> 00:24:33,580
What shock?

276
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:37,610
Seriously. You're normal.

277
00:24:46,650 --> 00:24:51,280
I gave up on 5 billion won trusting only you, Prosecutor Baek.

278
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:07,880
As for us, we'll do anything for money.

279
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:11,270
Be sure to take this. You'll need this for sure.

280
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:15,930
It was an amazing switch.

281
00:25:15,930 --> 00:25:19,080
They would've never imagined that you'd con the prosecutors.

282
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:20,920
Give me the bag.

283
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:23,450
I told you.

284
00:25:23,450 --> 00:25:29,230
Our country's prosecutors are blinded by their desire for success. They have no interest in conmen like us.

285
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:34,410
The Prosecutors Office is the problem.

286
00:25:34,410 --> 00:25:36,530
Hurry up and open it.

287
00:25:54,540 --> 00:25:57,540
Sa Do Chan!

288
00:26:06,510 --> 00:26:13,470


289
00:26:17,850 --> 00:26:18,650
 Switch 

290
00:26:18,650 --> 00:26:20,820
 Switch
 Change the World 

291
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:22,700
 You stabbed the prosecutors in the back? 

292
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:24,560
 I think I have to have some insurance to work with you. 

293
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:26,360
 So dirty. How can you blackmail me? 
A conman goes to work! 

294
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:29,130
 You're making me stand in for a prosecutor for a few days and now you want to change my life? 

295
00:26:29,130 --> 00:26:31,460
 Did I say that? While you're doing it, do it perfectly. 

296
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:33,420
  Prosecutor Baek. Baek Joon Soo. 

297
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:35,220
 Baek Joon Soo is alive? 

298
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:37,300
 Baek Joon Soo. Leave that to Baek Joon Soo. 

299
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:38,660
 Leave it to Prosecutor Baek. 

300
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:41,460
 Please catch the bad guy. 
  Hide your identity and solve the case 

301
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:43,980
 I have a habit of keeping my promise. 

302
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:45,490
 - Do Chan! 
 - Did something happen? 

303
00:26:45,490 --> 00:26:48,420
 - Hyung! 
 - You guys think nothing of Korea's prosecutors. 

304
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:52,280
 Who the hell are you! 

305
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:55,100
â™«  I can't let him go  â™«
