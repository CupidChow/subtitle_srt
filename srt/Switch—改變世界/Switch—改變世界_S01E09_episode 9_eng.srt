1
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:16,500
 The President? Are you saying you're going to search through the President's motorcade? 

2
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:21,330
The last hole that I had mentioned. It's Air Force One.

3
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:26,040
 Who are you, people? 

4
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:40,230
It's here. It's here.

5
00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:43,540
 What's happening? 

6
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:48,520
 Aren't those drugs? 

7
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:49,940
 Oh my! 

8
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:05,770
 What happened? 

9
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:07,490
Are they really drugs?

10
00:02:07,490 --> 00:02:09,510
Were you smuggling drugs?

11
00:02:09,510 --> 00:02:10,980
 Is it really true that you're connected to this case? 

12
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:18,860
 As for this case, with the Prosecutors' Office's honor on the line... 

13
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:22,680
 - Move. 
 - Step aside! 

14
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:27,550
Are they really drugs?

15
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:34,690
 Breaking news. Inside a diplomatic pouch which belongs to a diplomat who was accompanying the President from his trip abroad... 

16
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:38,320
 It has shocked everyone because of the discovery of the new narcotic LSDT. 

17
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:42,970
 The Prosecutors' Office arrested diplomat Choi Sang Hyeon on the spot and escorted him into the Prosecutors' Office. 

18
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:07,200
Good job. You caught a big one, Deputy Prosecutor Yang.

19
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,420
But I'm wondering how the Chief Prosecutor would react to all this...

20
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:13,970
I know. Next time, you report to me first before you make your move.

21
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:18,970
Yes. But for me to explain everything in detail is...

22
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:20,990
What is this?!

23
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:26,540
You stopped the President just to catch a drug dealer.  Without even reporting to me?

24
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:33,680
I won't let this go easy. Be prepared to face consequences.

25
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,990
What do we do?

26
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:45,110
What's going on?

27
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:47,660
What's going on!

28
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:51,880
I had no idea they'd stop the President's motorcade.

29
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:56,250
Did you make sure to shut up that diplomat?

30
00:03:56,250 --> 00:04:01,980
He was only in contact with President Hwang. He doesn't know about me or you.

31
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:04,210
How can you be so relaxed about it right now?

32
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:07,770
They'll be tracing the flow of money and get search and seizure warrants!

33
00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:10,820
Who knows what's going to pop up at some point?

34
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:17,280
Hurry up and stop him or crush him!

35
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:20,090
I understand.

36
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:27,930
Choi Jang Hyeon, let's talk.

37
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:32,050
You must be hungry. You drank three cups of coffee.

38
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:35,690
You didn't do this alone.

39
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:44,090
Thank you.

40
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:45,800
How is it going? Still the same?

41
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:50,020
He's kept his mouth shut for the last six hours.

42
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:52,850
He's going to plead the fifth, huh?

43
00:04:58,570 --> 00:05:01,740
How did you know there were drugs inside the sculpture?

44
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:06,420
Yeah, well... you just know...

45
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:09,600
Should I say a hunch that exists for people who work in a special line of work?

46
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:14,160
You broke the President's sculpture based on your hunch?

47
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:17,640
You want me to believe that?

48
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:20,670
Prosecutor Oh, you know what?

49
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:24,470
I know how to plead the fifth as well. In five different languages.

50
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:28,450
Be honest with me. Where did you get the tip?

51
00:05:30,450 --> 00:05:34,790
Just because you solved this case, you think I would trust you that quickly?

52
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:39,080
Tell me where you got your tip.

53
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:44,450
What if we didn't find the drugs? We'd be out.

54
00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:48,620
Shouldn't you say thank you rather than being suspicious of me?

55
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:13,280
 FEEL Gallery 
 Contemporary Art 

56
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:19,960
Isn't it a little too early to play chess in the morning?

57
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:25,370
You pulled in a big case yesterday. Congratulations.

58
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:27,810
Everything's going your way.

59
00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:29,840
I want to thank you.

60
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:32,390
You're thankful?  To me?

61
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:36,420
I saw the moai figure on the first day I stopped by here.

62
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:39,150
The moai figure?

63
00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:42,550
A huge stone figure that stands on Easter Island in the Pacific Ocean.

64
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:45,720
They call that moai.

65
00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:51,170
But I saw exactly the same thing among the things that belonged to the diplomat.

66
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:55,760
And what if it were hollow inside...

67
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:00,280
I said, "Oh, well" and just broke it.

68
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:03,960
But then you found drugs inside that.

69
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:09,110
That's amazing.

70
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:13,200
Had I not seen it here, I couldn't even have imagined (that contained drugs).

71
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:20,720
So you're saying...

72
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:24,070
you think I may be involved in that drug case?

73
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:28,230
If not, I'm grateful that you gave me the idea.

74
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:31,110
If you're involved with it...

75
00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:45,190
Prosecutor Baek, you don't know how to beat around the bush. You're very straightforward.

76
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:46,070
Forgive me if I was out of line.

77
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:49,950
No. We have to clear it up if there are misunderstandings.

78
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:53,620
I have OCD, you know.

79
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:59,090
Secretary Song. We held the Central and South American art exhibition before, didn't we?

80
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:02,920
Bring me all the documents on that.

81
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:19,780
I sign up for insurance in advance in case of damages that may occur during the exhibit preparation.

82
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:24,760
Here is the file on the claim we made on damages.

83
00:08:28,850 --> 00:08:32,550
 Transit Insurance Accidental Damage Policy 

84
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:46,100


85
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:53,480
 Switch

 05 
 A moving target 

87
00:08:58,670 --> 00:09:02,430
Yes. I understand.

88
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:06,780
I'll get to the bottom of this. Yes.

89
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:13,740
Prosecutor General, here is the report on the disciplinary action against Prosecutors Baek Joon Soon and Oh Ha Ra.

90
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:18,520
 Report on Prosecutor Disciplinary Actions 

91
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:27,460
The Chief Prosecutor is being so harsh.

92
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:30,930
He really intends to  fire us, huh?

93
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:34,490
We were prepared for disciplinary action when we began this mission.

94
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:39,260
The issue is not about a pay cut. It can be at least a suspension or...

95
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:41,690
Dismissal?

96
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:46,760
What is this? Then, I can't start my own lawyer office?

97
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,680
How can you joke at a time like this?

98
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:53,160
Prosecutor Oh, your heart is beating too fast, so I wanted to comfort you.

99
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:12,060
You know Prosecutor Baek Joon Soo?

100
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:16,110
Could he come to work starting tomorrow?

101
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:19,240
What are you saying? He is so sick that he can barely talk.

102
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:21,610
You want me to drag him out just to be disciplined?

103
00:10:21,610 --> 00:10:24,630
It's a serious situation.

104
00:10:25,450 --> 00:10:29,370
I guess the Blue House is being extremely forceful.

105
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:33,520
So, the Prosecutor General

106
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:36,710
ordered the formation of a special investigation team.

107
00:10:37,330 --> 00:10:39,450
A special investigation team?

108
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:44,310
Isn't that good news? We can perform a thorough investigation. That's what we want.

109
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:46,490
The real problem is

110
00:10:47,330 --> 00:10:50,170
the team leader for the special investigation team is...

111
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,650
Prosecutor Baek Joon Soo.

112
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:06,100
If so, do I get extra pay?

113
00:11:13,890 --> 00:11:17,420
 With the presidential position on the line, 

114
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:21,120
 I will cooperate with all the investigations conducted by the Prosecutors' Office in this case. 

115
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:26,250
 Also, regardless of the position anyone holds, 

116
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:30,650
 they must be punished according to the law.  
 If necessary, I will cooperate with the Prosecutors' Office investigation 

117
00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:38,250
Are you a quack doctor?

118
00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:40,470
Why are you trying to pick on my flaws?

119
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:43,790
Why isn't Sunbae Baek getting any better?

120
00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:49,750
Since you're here, change the transmission and put in new engine oil.

121
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:51,960
Can't you do that?

122
00:11:54,970 --> 00:11:56,700
We don't have much time.

123
00:11:56,700 --> 00:12:00,380
Yes, yes. I'll try my best.

124
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:06,340
On my way here, I got scolded by Prosecutor Oh

125
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:08,560
about why you aren't getting better quicker.

126
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:11,200
She told me to change your engine oil, too.

127
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,490
She wants to see you drive around fast.

128
00:12:13,490 --> 00:12:17,700
Aigoo, what's the use in just changing the engine

129
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:20,720
when the engine is dead?

130
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:23,670
Haven't you told her yet?

131
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:25,440
No, not yet.

132
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:29,340
You have to give those around you time to process it.

133
00:12:29,930 --> 00:12:31,490
Not just yet.

134
00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:34,990
I'll tell them when I'm ready, but until then

135
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:36,850
just pretend that you don't know anything.

136
00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:40,010
Ay... Let me see.

137
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:52,490
You've suffered a lot.

138
00:12:52,490 --> 00:12:54,660
I'll take my leave then.

139
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:59,240
Up until now, Sa Do Chan has been just wearing a doctor's gown pretending to be a doctor.

140
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:01,640
It's not like he was treating any patients.

141
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:07,300
But it's different now. They're asking him to hold the scalpel and do the surgery.

142
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:11,030
On top of that, the detectives will be sent out once the special investigation team is formed.

143
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:13,550
And more prosecutors will be added.

144
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,720
Sa Do Chan will receive all the attention.

145
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:19,920
Well, I'm fine with receiving attention since I'm used to it.

146
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:24,120
Should I say that it's a matter of time before you get caught?

147
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,500
It's not like you can go out there in this state, Sunbae.

148
00:13:35,170 --> 00:13:40,300
I trust that Sa Do Chan can do it well.

149
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:55,330


150
00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:01,820
 Diplomatic Pouch Drug Smuggling Special Investigation Team 

151
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:17,630
You are going to be on this team too, Sunbae?

152
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:20,210
It's the first time ever something like this happened in the history of our Constitution.

153
00:14:20,210 --> 00:14:22,960
Don't you think you need a veteran prosecutor like me?

154
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,960
Wow, I'm getting worried.

155
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:28,690
The Prosecutors Office outsider is the team leader.

156
00:14:28,690 --> 00:14:32,410
A dumba** without any experience will be all over the place trying to conduct an investigation.

157
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:53,160
I'm sorry.

158
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:57,040
Is this place too small or are you too fat (to pass without bothering me)?

159
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,470
Because I never lost my baby fat.

160
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:03,800
Then he should lose weight.

161
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:19,670
 I can't accept this, Chief Prosecutor. 

162
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:21,750
  I have seniority over prosecutor Baek. 

163
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:25,000
Are you asking me to work under my hoobae?

164
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,810
I'm not asking you to work under Prosecutor Baek.

165
00:15:27,810 --> 00:15:31,310
I'm asking you to confirm that you are in my line.

166
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:35,970
Ah, the line?

167
00:15:38,890 --> 00:15:43,440
I'll report all the details of how the special investigation team is doing.

168
00:15:53,330 --> 00:15:56,370
I'm Prosecutor Baek Joon Soo who is in charge of the special investigation team.

169
00:15:56,370 --> 00:16:00,320
I'm sure you've all introduced yourselves, so I'll get to the point.

170
00:16:00,890 --> 00:16:03,920
Choi Sang Hyeon is just a courier for the drug smuggling organization.

171
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:06,040
We have to find out who is behind Choi Sang Hyeon.

172
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:09,430
Who is on top of this drug smuggling organization's so-called...

173
00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:11,680
We'd be able to catch Brown Bear.

174
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,840
- Detective Nam. 
 - Yes.

175
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,510
Here is the immigration document on Choi Sang Hyeon.

176
00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:19,080
Search the banks that are within this boundary and please find

177
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:21,290
- transactions that took place and secret safes. 
 - Okay.

178
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:24,710
Inspector Go, please request investigation with FIU. 
  FIU: An agency that analyzes criminal money laundering activities and slush funds. 

179
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:25,560
Yes!

180
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:27,860
As you know, Choi Sang Hyeon is a diplomat.

181
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:31,160
It's highly possible that he made up a paper company overseas.

182
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:33,070
Gil Sunbaenim.

183
00:16:33,070 --> 00:16:35,750
Please ask for cooperation from FinCEN.

184
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:38,860
Fin... what?

185
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:42,210
The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network in the US.

186
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:45,680
In order to prevent illegal funds from being laundered through different countries,

187
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:48,410
If you ask our attache at our embassy in Washington D.C., 
 Attache: a person on the staff of an ambassador. 

188
00:16:48,410 --> 00:16:50,760
If you ask our attache at our embassy in Washington D.C.,

189
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:53,880
If you ask the FinCEN to get in touch with them, it will be easier to take care of things.

190
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:56,740
If you ask the FinCEN to get in touch with them, it will work out.

191
00:16:56,740 --> 00:17:00,090
Ok, I will do so.

192
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:09,340
Doesn't Hyung seem like a real prosecutor, not just an avatar?

193
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:20,620
♫  Crazy other world  ♫

194
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:24,480
♫  Crazy&nbsp; A Choice like fate  ♫

195
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,880
♫  The things that are happening  ♫

196
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:30,430
 From now on, the Team A will conduct a search and seizure on Choi Sang Hyeon's home. 

197
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:33,930
Please don't move. We're taking everything that may be evidence.

198
00:17:33,930 --> 00:17:37,440
 Team B, go search and seizure the Ministry of Foreign Affairs office. 

199
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:41,370
 Bring everything that Choi Sang Hyeon has touched. 

200
00:17:43,370 --> 00:17:45,180
Thank you.

201
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:49,100
- Prosecutor Oh, we contacted the Columbian Embassy.
 - Yes.

202
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:53,700
 Choi Sang Hyeon. 

203
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:56,410
He is planning to immigrate to the Bahamas.

204
00:17:56,410 --> 00:17:58,300
Bahamas?

205
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:00,740
Prosecutor, FinCEN contacted me.

206
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:04,370
They discovered Choi Sang Hyeon's secret account in a Bahamian bank.

207
00:18:07,130 --> 00:18:09,340
Please check the deposit history on this account.

208
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:11,130
Yes, I understand.

209
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:19,300
Call President Hwang and tell him to stop the factory.

210
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:21,320
Yes, I already told him to halt.

211
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:23,700
Tell him to stop selling drugs.

212
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:27,340
Be sure to be on top of your guys, so that they can't move around on their own.

213
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:29,310
Yes, I understand.

214
00:18:32,170 --> 00:18:34,000
 Bahamas? 

215
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,310
That prosecutor punk found that out already?

216
00:18:36,310 --> 00:18:39,930
Yes, I did cover it up double and triple, but

217
00:18:39,930 --> 00:18:43,410
if he finds out about the Bahamian account after the Canadian account,

218
00:18:43,410 --> 00:18:45,320
it can create a bigger wave than we expected.

219
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:47,680
 This, this. This won't do. 

220
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:50,480
If this leaks, you and I both die.

221
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:53,130
I'm saying we'll lose everything!

222
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:56,300
Turn this around.

223
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:58,770
Whatever you have to do,

224
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:01,110
you have to turn this game around.

225
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:01,990
Yes.

226
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:06,750
For now, I think we're going to have to push this as the diplomat's personal deviation.

227
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:11,270
Please order the media to set the tone first.

228
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:26,740
They found out about the Bahamian account already?

229
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:28,510
Oh wow.

230
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:31,180
Thank you and keep working hard.

231
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:33,230
- I'll see you again.
 - Yes.

232
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:43,390
Looks like I'll be competing with him.

233
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:45,460
I've got to rush it.

234
00:19:56,650 --> 00:19:58,640
 That's a unique necklace. 

235
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:01,660
Isn't that the goddess of justice, Dike? 
  Dike: Goddess of justice in Greece mythology. She holds a scale with her eyes blindfolded. 

236
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:04,680
- This?
 - You bought it?

237
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:07,200
If not then, did you get that from someone?

238
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:12,050
 Are you going to take that with you? 

239
00:20:12,050 --> 00:20:15,930
  I think you might break it if you take it with you. 

240
00:20:15,930 --> 00:20:17,330
I took it away from someone.

241
00:20:17,330 --> 00:20:21,180
You took it away? It doesn't even look that nice.

242
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:24,400
14K? 18K?

243
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,410
This is a one of a kind, limited edition.

244
00:20:26,410 --> 00:20:30,760
You took away a limited edition? Prosecutor Oh, that's theft.

245
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:34,540
He won't be reporting it, so don't worry.

246
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:54,090
How far did the investigation get?

247
00:20:54,090 --> 00:20:56,070
We're following bank accounts with false names.

248
00:20:56,070 --> 00:20:59,310
These guys. False names on top of one another.

249
00:20:59,310 --> 00:21:01,620
They've scattered them all over the place.

250
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:03,810
It's difficult to track them.

251
00:21:03,810 --> 00:21:05,480
Of course, it is.

252
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:09,350
I'm sure they made up paper companies here and there as well.

253
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:11,750
In the end, everything will gather in one reservoir.

254
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:14,090
The problem is whose account that is.

255
00:21:14,090 --> 00:21:17,340
How is Sa Do Chan?

256
00:21:18,170 --> 00:21:22,280
We discuss the direction of the investigation together, but as for final approval

257
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:24,900
or legal procedures, I'm doing everything.

258
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:27,860
There are no problems as far as procedures are concerned, so don't worry.

259
00:21:29,610 --> 00:21:34,110
Even though you're sitting here like this, I came here all this way for your strategy.

260
00:21:34,110 --> 00:21:36,170
It's all thanks to you, Sunbae.

261
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:39,500
Aren't I right? You made a ruckus by breaking through diplomatic customs

262
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:42,980
and creating chaos at the airport with the warrant.

263
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:46,460
In order to bring in drugs through the Air Force One,

264
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:49,310
you let things flow that way on purpose.

265
00:21:50,150 --> 00:21:51,710
Ha Ra,

266
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:57,680
I told you clearly. We're working with Sa Do Chan just this once.

267
00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:03,700
Once we finish this investigation, we will have to hand in our resignation and receive punishment.

268
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:06,990
Did someone say otherwise? I told you, I'll take punishment.

269
00:22:06,990 --> 00:22:11,500
But I wish we wouldn't be treated the same way by defining what we did as "crime."

270
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:17,180
"Crime." That's not the subject, Korean language. It's math. If you just look at the word "Crime," it's all the same.

271
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:20,440
Just a noun. This is a crime and that's a crime, too.

272
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:21,620
It's different in reality though.

273
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:26,110
Theft, fraud, assault, murder.

274
00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:28,890
They all carry different weight.

275
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:32,270
That's why there's a scale,

276
00:22:32,270 --> 00:22:36,520
to fairly judge which sin is heavier.

277
00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:40,490
You remembered well.

278
00:22:40,490 --> 00:22:47,930
So, first of all... first of all, let's catch those people, huh?

279
00:22:52,940 --> 00:23:00,230
Your sister, while working in that special task force or whatever, isn't she constantly hanging around Prosecutor Baek?

280
00:23:00,230 --> 00:23:04,210
She stuck by his side even before.

281
00:23:04,210 --> 00:23:05,880
Don't be like that.

282
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:09,640
Don't you know that the more you try to separate a man and a woman, the more they stick together?

283
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:14,860
Does that special task force team leader or whatever. Does he make a lot of money doing that?

284
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:16,190
What do you mean by money?

285
00:23:16,190 --> 00:23:20,460
He does so many things, but his salary is the same.

286
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:22,110
Then, tell her to forget him.

287
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:26,580
If he earned a lot of money, I was willing to allow it.

288
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:29,640
There are just two ways for a prosecutor to earn money well.

289
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:34,560
Become a corrupt prosecutor by accepting bribes or become a star prosecutor and go to a law firm.

290
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:39,740
If Prosecutor Baek does well on this case, he'll probably become a star prosecutor.

291
00:23:40,590 --> 00:23:42,350
Really?

292
00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:46,410
What should I do about Unni and Prosecutor Baek? Should I cut ties or bind them together?

293
00:23:46,410 --> 00:23:54,230
After close scrutiny, let's decide.

294
00:24:02,370 --> 00:24:05,170
Isn't he saying for us not to sell this?

295
00:24:05,170 --> 00:24:07,710
Ah, it's such a waste.

296
00:24:07,710 --> 00:24:11,100
If we go to Seoul and sell it secretly, wouldn't no one know about it?

297
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:13,450
Ri An, do you think that way too?

298
00:24:13,450 --> 00:24:14,940
Yes.

299
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:18,030
- Ho Seong, you too? 
 - I don't think it's a bad idea.

300
00:24:18,030 --> 00:24:21,230
Right. We're selling just a little bit in secret. How would they know?

301
00:24:21,230 --> 00:24:24,610
No one would know, right? Right? I'm not doing anything wrong, right?

302
00:24:24,610 --> 00:24:25,490
Yes.

303
00:24:25,490 --> 00:24:30,200
That's right, let's go for it. Let's go for it. Go, go!

304
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:43,660
Go safely and sell it quickly.

305
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:45,240
Yes.

306
00:25:12,190 --> 00:25:14,060
Why? Did you sell it already?

307
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:17,320
We're in big trouble! There's a cop. A cop!

308
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:19,340
Over there.

309
00:25:22,210 --> 00:25:25,450
Hey, hurry. Hurry, hurry. Go quickly.

310
00:25:25,450 --> 00:25:27,950
Just take a look at this image.

311
00:25:29,650 --> 00:25:33,390
This is Greek God Cronos who appears in the myths.

312
00:25:33,390 --> 00:25:38,780
With a huge sickle, he castrated his father Uranus and became the ruler of universe.

313
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:41,630
He became the most powerful god.

314
00:25:41,630 --> 00:25:44,680
The one who is being eaten, is that his father?

315
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:48,420
No, it's his son.

316
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:55,050
After becoming a ruler, to maintain his power, he even goes so far as to eat his son.

317
00:25:55,050 --> 00:25:58,800
The idea of power is surely really scary.

318
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:01,020
There is this saying...

319
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:04,090
Excuse me for a minute.

320
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:11,760
Mr. Jo tried to sell drugs...

321
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,090
Where did I leave off?

322
00:26:21,090 --> 00:26:24,790
That he ate his son to maintain his power.

323
00:26:24,790 --> 00:26:27,670
Yes, there is this saying.

324
00:26:27,670 --> 00:26:32,590
"Power does not tolerate a vacuum."

325
00:26:33,450 --> 00:26:40,170
"Power cannot be shared even between a father and son."

326
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:51,550
Prosecutor! LSDT was discovered in Hongdae.

327
00:26:51,550 --> 00:26:53,260
What about the sellers? Did they get caught?

328
00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:56,740
They said that they just left their things and fled the scene.

329
00:27:01,010 --> 00:27:05,080
CEO Geum, what happened?

330
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:08,870
How can you let loose the item when things are so serious and tight?

331
00:27:08,870 --> 00:27:10,270
What do you mean by things?

332
00:27:10,270 --> 00:27:13,400
In the Hongdae area.

333
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:18,580
If things get more noisy, then even I won't  be able to block it.

334
00:27:28,910 --> 00:27:31,750
This guy, really...

335
00:27:47,170 --> 00:27:50,010
You were selling the drugs?

336
00:27:50,010 --> 00:27:54,700
- Yes. 
 - I was wondering why there were flies roaming around in my territory.

337
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:57,290
It was Mr. Jo.

338
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:02,500
Please save me, CEO.

339
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:07,350
When you close a business, isn't it basic to clear out the inventory?

340
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:09,400
Quiet!

341
00:28:10,210 --> 00:28:13,510
The drug bust squad is spread all over Hongdae.

342
00:28:13,510 --> 00:28:18,030
You can't just let this situation slide.

343
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:23,450
Take care of him so he'll come to his senses.

344
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:29,610
Just enough so that they don't die. Do you understand what I'm saying?

345
00:28:29,610 --> 00:28:32,430
I will do as you command.

346
00:28:36,290 --> 00:28:40,130
CEO, CEO, CEO!

347
00:28:41,030 --> 00:28:43,830
CEO, CEO!

348
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:05,130
Come out!

349
00:29:07,230 --> 00:29:07,910
Stay still!

350
00:29:07,910 --> 00:29:09,920
C'mon!

351
00:29:33,950 --> 00:29:35,670
Open it.

352
00:29:35,670 --> 00:29:38,090
Open the door!

353
00:29:43,130 --> 00:29:46,600
Catching the people who made you like that is so close.

354
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:48,830
 We are almost there. 

355
00:29:49,730 --> 00:29:53,460
Sunbae, why? Did something happen?

356
00:29:54,350 --> 00:29:56,040
Did perhaps Sa Do Chan

357
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:59,560
act as my avatar without any secret intention to gain personally?

358
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:01,810
Why? Because you're afraid he might commit a fraud again?

359
00:30:01,810 --> 00:30:07,940
Don't worry. If he tries to commit fraud again, I will break him in two.

360
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:10,260
I'm curious about that,

361
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:14,630
the target that Sa Do Chan is really aiming for.

362
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:33,130
Governor, how are you.

363
00:30:33,130 --> 00:30:34,900
Long time, no see.

364
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:37,250
Oh, yes. Did you come?

365
00:30:46,060 --> 00:30:47,960
Bull's eye, Governor.

366
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:52,770
Archery is great for training your mind and body.

367
00:30:52,770 --> 00:30:59,030
Prosecutor Jeong, do you know where the phrase "hitting the mark" (Gwa Nyeok) came from?

368
00:30:59,030 --> 00:31:05,640
Gwa means to penetrate. Nyeok means leather.

369
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:10,310
They say there's leather underneath the target in the center.

370
00:31:10,310 --> 00:31:15,890
If you just shoot this arrow, the leather will totally...

371
00:31:17,170 --> 00:31:20,320
rip apart.

372
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:22,160
Yes.

373
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:25,630
Prosecutor Jeong, try shooting it.

374
00:31:30,990 --> 00:31:33,130
A little higher.

375
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:38,500
A little higher.

376
00:31:41,930 --> 00:31:46,360
Governor, the target is below.

377
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:49,030
Look more upwards.

378
00:31:49,030 --> 00:31:54,590
Don't you see that eagle in the sky? Wow, it's big!

379
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:02,820
A man must catch something big to grow bigger.

380
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:09,070
You want to enter our Namsan club, right? Catch someone big.

381
00:32:11,330 --> 00:32:13,910
What are you doing not shooting quickly?

382
00:32:36,890 --> 00:32:39,000
