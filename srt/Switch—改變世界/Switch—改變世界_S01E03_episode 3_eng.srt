1
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:19,670
What's this?

2
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:23,190
What the.

3
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:33,750
 Timing and

4
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:40,860
Huh?

5
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:43,970
Sa Do Chan!

6
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:47,570
Whoa. What a brilliant switch.

7
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:50,780
Who would have imagined that you would con a prosecutor?

8
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:52,430
Give me the bag.

9
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:57,580
I told you that Korean prosecutors are so blinded by their desire for success

10
00:00:57,580 --> 00:01:00,840
and have no desire to catch con men like us.

11
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:04,820
Prosecutors are the problem.

12
00:01:05,770 --> 00:01:08,000
Hurry up and open it.

13
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:20,380
Sa Do Chan! Damn bastard. Such a jerk.

14
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:23,720
What the! I should have drowned him in the ocean.

15
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:26,710
Get out! Get out! Darn.

16
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:30,600
Ha Ra. Ha Ra. Get yourself together.

17
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:34,930
Darn. I won't forgive you once I catch you.

18
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:38,210
 Departure 

19
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:46,330
 02 Secretly, dangerously 

20
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,060
 President Jo Seong Doo 

21
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:51,880
What am I going to do about the lost money, 30 billion won?

22
00:01:52,730 --> 00:01:55,260
Hey, College Graduate, come here.

23
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:56,900
Yes, College Graduate.

24
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:01,530
What shall I tell the CEO? Is there any excuse I can use to lessen his anger?

25
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:04,550
Yes. Tell him that you tried to create a slush fund.

26
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:07,550
You were winning money until the prosecutor raided.

27
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:11,900
Whoa! As I expected, you're different as a college graduate.  You're wrong, wrong.   A slush fund.

28
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:14,000
I am not wrong. I am different.

29
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,080
Here, if something is wrong, it isn't right. If something is different, it is not the same.

30
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:22,730
So, to say that I am wrong is using the wrong word.

31
00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:25,390
There you go again. Again and again. Are you here to teach me?

32
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:28,180
Are you my teacher?

33
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:30,740
The CEO is here.

34
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:33,120
Hey, forget this!

35
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,770
There's this really delicious curry restaurant in the Maldives.

36
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:37,540
- Really? 
 - I'll take you there.

37
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:39,450
- Really? 
 - Of course.

38
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:41,180
Wow...

39
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:43,320
Are you going somewhere nice?

40
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,900
We're going to the Maldives.

41
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:46,880
Ah, the Maldives.

42
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:53,830
- Your group? 
 - What are you talking about?

43
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:56,160
I'm an individualist.

44
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,450
In any case, what brings you here, Prosecutor Oh?

45
00:02:58,450 --> 00:03:03,050
Don't you think that we need to talk? Should we step outside?

46
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:10,730
Why are there so many people who want to talk to me?

47
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:13,270
Please spare my life, CEO.

48
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:17,430
Seong Doo, I heard you touched the company's money again.

49
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:20,360
About that, CEO ...

50
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,660
I was trying to set up a slush fund for the company.

51
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:24,700
- You gambled? 
 - That's...

52
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:29,270
I was going to multiply it by 2.5 times, but the prosecutor barged in.

53
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:30,860
A prosecutor?

54
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:34,080
You scammed a prosecutor?

55
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,580
- I should just hit you. 
 - This is interesting.

56
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:39,470
- How did you know that I was here? 
 - Tracker.

57
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:42,330
 I'll confiscate this for now. 

58
00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:44,350
A tracker?

59
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:45,740
You're illegally monitoring a civilian!

60
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:50,990
When I had to deal with such a cheeky con artist like you, shouldn't I prepare this much at least?

61
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:53,120
Hurry and give it to me.

62
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:57,210
Well, about that,

63
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:03,360
don't be shocked and listen. Inside the box,

64
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:11,530
there was nothing.

65
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:14,180
Do you expect me to believe that?

66
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:21,220
Well...he is called Baek Joon Soo.

67
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:30,050
Baek Joon Soo is alive?

68
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,680
Is he someone you know?

69
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:35,780
Is it this person?

70
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:42,030
Yes, that's right. It's him. It's him. Yes.

71
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:45,420
I'm sorry, CEO. This is my fault.

72
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:51,010
This is what's so disappointing about a fish that got away.

73
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:04,960
Why can't you believe me?

74
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:08,550
I'm serious, there was nothing in the box.

75
00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:16,070
Yes, Detective. Did you look through everything?

76
00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:21,270
There was nothing? Okay, thank you.

77
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:27,150
Where did you hide it?

78
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:30,950
I'm curious as well. What kind of person took an item worth five million dollars.

79
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:33,170
- Five million dollars? 
 - That's what Nam Seung Tae said.

80
00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:35,250
He gave up five million dollars (for it).

81
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:39,190
Did you pretend to cooperate with me thinking you'd make money off of that?

82
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:41,140
You scammer...

83
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:43,120
Then what is in it?

84
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:51,520
It's Nam Seung Tae. Answer it.

85
00:05:57,310 --> 00:06:00,330
Mr. Nam Seung Tae, what happened?

86
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:05,720
 I'm sorry, Prosecutor. To be honest, I have the item. 

87
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:11,280
 There is a condition. 

88
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:16,170
 In order for me to disappear, I need money. 

89
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:18,660
100,000 dollars?

90
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:25,250
Oh, this is crazy. How are we supposed to get that money? Ah, this is a problem.

91
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:26,810
We have to get the money somehow.

92
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:28,540
So exactly, how?

93
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:32,120
Should I get a loan from a loan shark or should I put  a mortgage on my house?

94
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:34,360
Thank you, Director.

95
00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:39,220
Why are you like this to me, really? Learn to take a joke, will you?

96
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:41,250
We must get the item.

97
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:44,940
We should. We really should get the item.

98
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:50,150
Special project fund.

99
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:54,780
Special project fund! That's available for times like this one.

100
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:55,930
- I'm right? 
 - You're right.

101
00:06:55,930 --> 00:06:59,290
Okay, I'll use any method to get the fund approved.

102
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:01,630
Just give me one week.

103
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:03,960
You must get it approved.

104
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:07,320
They'll approve it, right?

105
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:13,670
One week?  Got it.

106
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:17,480
You must come alone.

107
00:07:54,910 --> 00:07:56,550
Let go of me. Let go.

108
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:10,170
Did you really think that you could run away from us? Where is the item?

109
00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:13,360
I'll never tell a monster like you.

110
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:23,270
Before I finish this book, tell me where the item is.

111
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:28,490
If you don't tell me by then, you could die.

112
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:43,170
Burn it.

113
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:50,700
Now, you have it. There's no need to bring Prosecutor Baek and kill him.

114
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:56,180
Before there are more punks like you, I need to take care of them for good.

115
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:06,470
Okay. You've confirmed that I'm innocent.

116
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:10,570
In any case, I sincerely hope you obtain the item safely.

117
00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:15,600
Prosecutor Oh. So, let's never see each other again.

118
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:20,790
What is it this time?

119
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:22,640
Did you become fond of me?

120
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:25,070
- The situation has changed. 
 - The situation?

121
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:30,430
If I tell you to start working here from Monday, you'll refuse, right?

122
00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:34,880
This person, seriously. Are you joking with me? Why would I do that?

123
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:37,220
You won't be able to refuse.

124
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:39,120
Oppa! 
  Hangang Police Station 

125
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,000
Hyung!

126
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:46,620
Oppa, hurry and get us out of here. I'm cold and hungry. Get us out.

127
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:49,320
I thought I'd need insurance to work with you.

128
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,800
So dirty. How can you blackmail me?

129
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:54,040
I'm suggesting a negotiation strategically.

130
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:57,160
Next week, go get the item for us. I'll let them go then.

131
00:09:57,160 --> 00:10:01,690
What? We have to stay here for a week? Ah, Oppa!

132
00:10:01,690 --> 00:10:06,290
This place gives me the creeps. I haven't washed up in hours. Do you want to see me without makeup?

133
00:10:06,290 --> 00:10:10,030
Ugh, Oppa! Hurry and get us out!

134
00:10:10,030 --> 00:10:13,040
Okay, I'll do it,

135
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:16,830
if you change the conditions.

136
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:19,640
Let these people go now.

137
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:21,580
Ah, it's okay

138
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:23,720
Do you think I'll agree?

139
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:28,380
A public official's commission of a crime. You're an accomplice, too.

140
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:30,010
Are you threatening me?

141
00:10:30,010 --> 00:10:31,970
Can I call it a negotiation?

142
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:41,270
Huh?

143
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:44,550
Hey.

144
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,950
Hyung is over there.

145
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:02,210
Did you finish all the homework I gave you before you fell asleep?

146
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:14,270
You want me to memorize all this in a few days? Isn't this considered psychological abuse?

147
00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:15,670
Prosecutor Baek Joon Soo's birth date.

148
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:20,750
It's not like I'm going to make his birthday soup for him. Why should I care about his birthday? Especially a guy.

149
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:24,200
- Wanna die? 
 - Born on April 12, 1987.

150
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:29,180
At Gangwondo Sokcho City, Eungkangdong 3-22. Attended Donghae Elementary, Gangdong Junior High, Minseong High school

151
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:32,600
with very good grades and entered Seoul National University to study law.

152
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:35,690
He passed the 54th bar exam and was part of 44th Class for the Judicial Research and Training Institute.

153
00:11:35,690 --> 00:11:41,180
He was an outsider by choice since his law school days. He had almost no friends during his Judicial Institute days.

154
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:44,220
The only colleague he was close to

155
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:47,530
is the picky, bad-tempered, and foul-mouthed

156
00:11:47,530 --> 00:11:50,490
Oh Ha Ra, who seems like she's been a pill since high school.

157
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:53,930
Forget the unnecessary subjective opinions. How about potential troublemakers?

158
00:11:53,930 --> 00:11:58,870
Potential troublemakers. Refer to page 13 of the yellow file.

159
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:01,960
There are two colleagues he's somewhat friends with, and they're Kim Min Seok and Park Jeong Woo.

160
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:05,670
Kim Min Seok is currently at Daejeon Prosecutors Office and Park Jeong Woo is working at Chooncheon Prosecutors Office.

161
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:10,540
Therefore, the loose cannon who is in closest proximity is Deputy Prosecutor Woo Jae Sik.

162
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:15,480
He was a mentor from the get-go, and he's currently the deputy prosecutor for Ministry of Supervision in the building next door.

163
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:19,610
Never, never, never run into him. 
  Baek Joon Soo 

164
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:23,220
Never, never.

165
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:26,450
I'll leave first. Don't be late.

166
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:02,270
A prosecutor.

167
00:13:06,650 --> 00:13:09,750
Criminal Investigation Department 6.

168
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,530
Are you going in to be interrogated?

169
00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:18,360
Three years for denial. Probation if you confess. That's the way to live.

170
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:24,800
Do you know him?

171
00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:30,940
Hello, hello. Hello.

172
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:34,160
Oh, our pretty Mi Ran. Good morning.

173
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:39,990
I'm Prosecutor Baek. Prosecutor Baek Joon Soo.

174
00:13:45,710 --> 00:13:48,010
I really love this sound.

175
00:13:51,850 --> 00:13:53,380
Hey.

176
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:58,980
Hey, flippant fool. What's the point of memorizing everything in your head?

177
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:01,260
You're acting completely opposite of Sunbae Baek.

178
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:04,740
You're making me stand in for a prosecutor for a few days and now you want to change my life?

179
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:07,550
Did I say that? While you're doing it, do it perfectly.

180
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:11,040
Lower your voice and speak slowly. Your eyes should look serious. Got it?

181
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:16,110
Look at your tie.

182
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:20,710
Sunbae Baek always tied it with both ends to form an upside down triangle.

183
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:21,970
Go to the bathroom and tie it again.

184
00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:25,850
It's not like I'm going to live as Baek Joon Soo for the rest of my life. Let's just take it easy.

185
00:14:25,850 --> 00:14:27,720
Go.

186
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:31,710
Wear your eyeglasses, too!

187
00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:36,940
Geez, I worked hard to get to work this morning and she's nagging me about my tie.

188
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:41,630
I mean, who's going to recognize this? I wouldn't even mention it.

189
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:44,340
Who ties a tie an upside down triangle shape?

190
00:14:46,650 --> 00:14:48,380
And these.

191
00:15:10,570 --> 00:15:12,430
Excuse us.

192
00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:16,920
Let's do this right!

193
00:15:20,430 --> 00:15:22,340
Move please!

194
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:29,100

 Prosecutor Oh Ha Ra
 Inspector Go Gi Bong
 Inspector Im Soon Jeong 

195
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:31,530
This is Prosecutor Baek Joon Soo.

196
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:34,950
He returned from the Sokcho Prosecutors' Office just today.

197
00:15:34,950 --> 00:15:38,880
For now, he's going to work with Prosecutor Oh until he has an office.

198
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:41,410
Please help him out.

199
00:15:41,410 --> 00:15:43,480
Hello, I'm Baek Joon Soo.

200
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:47,050
Ah, seeing so many prosecutors and inspectors all at once,

201
00:15:47,050 --> 00:15:49,780
my heart is already bouncing.

202
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:53,500
Please help me out a lot in the future.

203
00:15:56,230 --> 00:16:00,580
Inspector Go, he's part of your team now. So, be sure to take care of him.

204
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:02,850
- Me? 
 - Yeah.

205
00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:09,520
My name is Go Gi Bong.

206
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:14,200
I thought you looked familiar. We've met briefly last year, right?

207
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:18,980
Ah... yes! We did!

208
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:23,520
I saw you earlier and was wondering where I saw you. I thought I saw you as a suspect.

209
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:30,890
A criminal type... go on in, go.

210
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:33,170
You hear that often anyway.

211
00:16:33,170 --> 00:16:35,040
So, fighting!

212
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,150
Fighting!

213
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:51,730
 Timing and

214
00:16:56,150 --> 00:16:58,770
Oh, hello.

215
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:08,670
What if he asks me something?

216
00:17:08,670 --> 00:17:11,640
That won't happen. Just breathe and do nothing.

217
00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:24,560
Everyone, be seated.

Baek Joon Soo.

220
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:42,580
Spain Cultural Center... Why did you go there?

221
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:54,630
Even before you were officially assigned to the Seoul office, how dare you go poking around places without reporting?

222
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:05,440
Prosecutor Baek, didn't you say you're going to Spain on your vacation next year?

223
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:08,430
- Ah. 
 - A vacation?

224
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:12,280
Criminal Investigation Department 6, aren't you guys being too lax? You want to work your a** off?

225
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:15,900
No. Don't go on vacation.

226
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:19,750
- Deputy Prosecutor Yang.
 - Yes?

227
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:26,130
You know the Taesang Group case? Give that to Baek Joon Soo.

228
00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:29,540
Yes, I understand.

229
00:18:30,530 --> 00:18:34,540
Baek Joon Soo, this is a Saji case. (Bribery case with no evidence and witnesses)

230
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:37,220
You know what you're supposed to do, right?

231
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:43,180
Yes, since it's a Saji case,

232
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:47,010
I'll tie up those bastards' saji ( limbs in Korean ) and bring them in.

233
00:18:59,910 --> 00:19:04,990
Wow, Prosecutor Baek, your sense of humor is... wow...

234
00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:07,130
Aigoo, I'm sorry.

235
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:11,110
Let's begin our meeting.

236
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:25,980
The heaven, earth, briber and bribee know (the bribery).

237
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:28,060
Because there are only four entities in this world who know of this bribery,

238
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:31,370
you call this bribery case a saji case.

239
00:19:32,370 --> 00:19:35,730
Wait. How would I know insider lingo when it's not even found in a law dictionary?

240
00:19:35,730 --> 00:19:38,760
I didn't think that far.

241
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:44,450
I put together prosecutors' jargon and insider lingo. So, memorize it for now.

242
00:19:46,550 --> 00:19:48,410
Hey, let's go.

243
00:19:55,170 --> 00:19:58,540
Yes, we'll be right there. Hey, let's go.

244
00:19:58,540 --> 00:20:02,170
Yes, yes. Hey, let's go.

245
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:12,520
Whoa, it's hard for those people who passed that tough bar exam to enjoy a meal in peace.

246
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:18,700
I thought prosecutors would eat sashimi for lunch and drink shots at night in a hostess bar ...

247
00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:26,210
 AKI The Association of Korean Industries  

248
00:20:37,910 --> 00:20:39,880
Welcome.

249
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:40,950
Hi.

250
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:43,510
Sir, you look healthy.

251
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:46,690
Really? Did all the kids gather?

252
00:20:46,690 --> 00:20:49,140
Yes, they're all waiting for you.

253
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:53,320
They did a great job of rebuilding this. When I became the prime minister for the first time,

254
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:56,380
we built this on the sand with your grandfather.

255
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:58,310
Yes, I know that well.

256
00:20:58,310 --> 00:21:01,350
Right, right. Let's go inside.

257
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:06,850
The world has changed.

258
00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:09,180
All of you who are running corporations,

259
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:12,500
you must boldly separate from the traditions of old.

260
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:16,100
You must run a fair and transparent corporation.

261
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:18,540
in order to survive in our current world.

262
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:23,320
Working with the new government we have...

263
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:28,260
 According to 2012 standard, our country's underground economy portion is 

264
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:31,320
 ranked number 6 among 34 OECD nations. 

265
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:33,330
 We have tripled the amount of the US. 

266
00:21:33,330 --> 00:21:37,040
 The reason our nation's underground economy is this high is because 

267
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:42,840
 there is so much corruption. A nation with corruption is not a happy nation. 

268
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:47,030
 People of Korea, a special law to eliminate corruption, 

269
00:21:47,030 --> 00:21:49,310
 we'll put that in place. 

270
00:21:49,310 --> 00:21:50,410
 People who earn high income shall pay high tax, 

271
00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:52,130
- Let's go to Namsan.
 -  and people with low income shall pay low tax. 

272
00:21:52,130 --> 00:21:54,310
Yes, sir.

273
00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:58,340
 The Blue House introduced a special law to eradicate the underground economy today. 

274
00:21:58,340 --> 00:22:02,310
 The special law to eradicate underground economy which was a huge part of the campaign promise that President Kang made,  

275
00:22:02,310 --> 00:22:07,310
 trying to cut off all the illegal flow of funds such as gambling, drugs, and etc. 

276
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:15,090
Welcome.

277
00:22:45,790 --> 00:22:49,660
In the Chinese classic text of The Tao Te Ching by Laozi,

278
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:52,860
there's a saying called "Sang Sun Yak Soo." (All good things flow like water.)

279
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:56,350
Flowing like water is the best thing.

280
00:22:56,350 --> 00:23:02,180
If the road is blocked, you will stop. If the pass is cleared, you will flow down just like water.

281
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:08,050
That's how I feel as I stand back and watch the world go around.

282
00:23:08,050 --> 00:23:11,300
Oh, these days, they do whatever they want to do.

283
00:23:12,630 --> 00:23:16,540
Who's the one who built it thus far!

284
00:23:24,670 --> 00:23:29,430
This old man got too excited.

285
00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:35,980
What can I do? I have to be able to speak my mind with you guys

286
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:39,670
so that I can feel relieved.

287
00:23:39,670 --> 00:23:40,730
Yes...

288
00:23:40,730 --> 00:23:42,510
All right, all right. Just a little longer.

289
00:23:42,510 --> 00:23:48,640
Just wait. He's got his weaknesses and soft spots.

290
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:51,310
I'm sure the flow will open up at some point.

291
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:56,940
At that time... all at once!

292
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:02,170
We get rid of everything.

293
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:29,380
 Prosecutor Baek Joon Soo 

294
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:26,810
Sunbae.

295
00:25:42,630 --> 00:25:46,050
What the heck. I thought you were Sunbae Baek.

296
00:25:57,390 --> 00:25:59,620
 Dropping the case 

297
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:02,170
 Prosecute 

298
00:26:04,110 --> 00:26:05,240
What's all this?

299
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:06,870
You were having a hard time working on my stuff—

300
00:26:06,870 --> 00:26:09,450
Did I ask you for help?

301
00:26:09,450 --> 00:26:12,440
How dare a conman touch these sacred investigation documents?

302
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:17,500
I mean... I just organized them. For your convenience, Prosecutor Oh.

303
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:18,970
Don't you ever touch them again.

304
00:26:18,970 --> 00:26:20,560
Okay.

305
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:23,820
 Record of Criminal Trial 1 

306
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:27,730
 Dropping the case 

307
00:26:27,730 --> 00:26:30,670
Why? Is something wrong?

308
00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:34,060
Did you really do this?

309
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:40,210
I'll go first.

310
00:26:40,210 --> 00:26:41,670
Okay.

311
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:49,800
Did Prosecutor Oh go home?

312
00:26:52,130 --> 00:26:55,560
There's nothing I can't do if I set my mind to it.

313
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:57,530
In any case, what confidence.

314
00:26:57,530 --> 00:27:00,240
How about it? You want me to do that for you again tomorrow?

315
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:04,960
If you want, Prosecutor Oh, I can do it ten times a day.

316
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:08,400
These guys... at a sacred workplace...

317
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:12,650
You came?

318
00:27:12,650 --> 00:27:14,310
Unni, who's this?

319
00:27:14,310 --> 00:27:18,210
What is your relationship with him? You two are so lovey-dovey.

320
00:27:18,210 --> 00:27:19,470
It's not like that.

321
00:27:19,470 --> 00:27:23,930
That's what I'm saying. Who is he?

322
00:27:23,930 --> 00:27:26,770
This is Prosecutor Baek Joon Soo.

323
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:29,160
This is my embarrassing sister.

324
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:32,130
The sisters are so friendly.

325
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:39,820
Prosecutor Baek, I've only heard about you and this is my first time meeting you. But you're very different from what I heard.

326
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:41,310
Well, yes, I'm sure.

327
00:27:41,310 --> 00:27:44,740
I've been upgraded all this time.

328
00:27:56,660 --> 00:27:59,780
Mom! Epic!

329
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:02,900
Baek Joon Soo comeback.

330
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:06,480
That Baek Joon Soo whom she used to hang around with since Judicial Training Institute days?

331
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:10,160
I don't know if they fell for each other while working late or they fell for each other and are making excuses to work late together.

332
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:13,610
He was so close to Unni.

333
00:28:13,610 --> 00:28:15,270
Heaven is merciless.

334
00:28:15,270 --> 00:28:19,710
I wasn't worried when I heard that he went to Sokcho. Now, if she hangs around him

335
00:28:19,710 --> 00:28:22,280
she'll lose all the guys.

336
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:24,200
It'd be nice to have a son-in-law who's a prosecutor.

337
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:28,540
One of them can get promoted as a prosecutor and the other one can open up an office as a lawyer. That's perfect.

338
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:30,710
I have to run a profitable business! (Meaning: Unni has to marry a better man.)

339
00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:35,150
Rich men and conglomerate families are lining up wanting to go on a blind date with your sister.

340
00:28:35,150 --> 00:28:39,570
I'm not saying I don't like prosecutors. I just like conglomerates more.

341
00:28:39,570 --> 00:28:46,100
Mom, but Baek Joon Soo... he's got fatal charm.

342
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:49,840
He's totally handsome.

343
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:51,160
Does a handsome face feed you?

344
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:52,310
- Mom. 
 - What?

345
00:28:52,310 --> 00:28:56,870
With that face, I think he can make a living.

346
00:28:56,870 --> 00:29:00,220
Eat rice and radish with it.

347
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:03,670
Wake up. How old are you?

348
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:21,600
I got the item.

349
00:29:23,810 --> 00:29:25,280
Yes.

350
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:41,140
Shall we begin?

351
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:44,380
I love this moment.

352
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:46,640
- Give it to me. 
 - Here you go.

353
00:30:35,410 --> 00:30:37,900
It's premium quality.

354
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:41,480
You'll get 20% more than before.

355
00:30:49,450 --> 00:30:57,100
 Dong Yeong Flour Mill 

356
00:31:00,610 --> 00:31:03,700
 Dong Yeong Flour Mill 

357
00:31:12,870 --> 00:31:14,700
Oh, all right.

358
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:18,240
Okay. Bye.

359
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:20,970
Prosecutor Baek, you have a guest.

360
00:31:20,970 --> 00:31:23,060
A guest? Who?

361
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:25,340
Deputy Prosecutor Woo Jae Sik.

362
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:27,310
Woo Jae Sik...

363
00:31:27,310 --> 00:31:29,940
 Deputy Prosecutor Woo Jae Sik 
 Never! Never! Never run into him!!! 

364
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:31,670
Woo Jae Sik?

365
00:31:33,780 --> 00:31:40,720
