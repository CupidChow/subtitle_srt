1
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:13,500


2
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:29,980
What are you doing in my seat?

3
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:33,220
Our Namsan Club needs a change.

4
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:38,170
A true leader who has more depth and strength.

5
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:42,850
Oh, my, that guy. What nonsense is he spewing?

6
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:44,590
What are you doing?

7
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:47,380
Move that thing!

8
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:54,120
I was going to send you off when the leaves fell and the cold wind blew.

9
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:57,350
I moved up my plans.

10
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:04,710
To make a new king,

11
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:09,420
shouldn't a kingmaker be new, too?

12
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:20,510
Governor, we also think

13
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:24,730
CEO Geum is a suitable person to lead our Namsan Club.

14
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:28,980
That's right. We decided to look at the future value.

15
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:31,060
You're getting up in age.

16
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:34,430
You should step down now.

17
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:53,700
 Please take good care of me. 

18
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:57,780
 What is it? 

19
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,920
 First half of the year record of Hangang Bank slush fund 

20
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:09,400
 If you want to keep your current position, you'll have to make a good choice. 

21
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:26,070
Geum Tae Woong, you! How dare you throw a coup d'etat?

22
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:31,550
Gye Choon Sik. You killed him, right?

23
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:36,690
Did you buy off this Namsan Club with that 100 billion won?

24
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,250
The flower is pretty when it blooms.

25
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:43,890
Don't you think it's ugly when it's wilted?

26
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:46,840
People say, "the redness  of flower (blossom/the best looking) lasts only for ten days."

27
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:50,410
 It's ugly when it wilts. 

28
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,310
Geum Tae Woong!

29
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:28,170
You betray me?

30
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:32,410
I'm Choi Jeong Pil.

31
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:36,470
I'll be sure you regret this.

32
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:46,550
 K-Savings Bank 

33
00:03:56,170 --> 00:04:01,010
Prosecutor, before and after the hour when the manager fell off the building... The security system went down.

34
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:02,770
Went down?

35
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:04,150
This crime was planned.

36
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:08,370
On top of that, if the security system of one whole building was messed with, it means it was done by extraordinary bastards.

37
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:13,240
That's right. The system was down two to three hours. The fact that the CCTV clips are missing  exactly during that time ...

38
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:15,290
Isn't this weird?

39
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:17,270
I'm sure this is a murder.

40
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,710
Baek Joon Soo and Oh Ha Ra sent the detectives.

41
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:29,270
They came to look through K-Savings Bank.

42
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:32,780
Baek Joon Soo. Oh Ha Ra?

43
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:37,880
Bring in the chief prosecutor.

44
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,180
Okay.

45
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:49,950
Who the hell is he, telling me to come and go?

46
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,740
As someone aiming for the presidency,

47
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:03,380
how can you be so lax in controlling your minions?

48
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:11,050
It looks like Baek Joon Soo smells something fishy about the bank manager case.

49
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:16,070
I hear he's going around digging into it with Prosecutor Oh Ha Ra.

50
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:21,120
- I'll take care of it. 
 - Take care of it?

51
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:24,650
Not just take care of it. Wrap it up.

52
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:27,710
A prosecutor is an individual,

53
00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:30,010
independent legal entity.

54
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:32,500
Just because they're conducting investigations, I can't fire them.

55
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:36,410
If I make a move without a reason, the prosecutors will protest

56
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:41,870
- What are you doing... 
 - Jeong Do Yeong.

57
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:44,940
Haven't you figured out the situation yet?

58
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:54,240
The fact that I can make you a king means that I can bring you down as well.

59
00:05:55,570 --> 00:06:00,060
Do I still look like the one you used to meet under the Han River bridge in secret?

60
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:03,180
Do you only see me as Choi Jeong Pil's shadow entity?

61
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:14,550
I gave you the kibble you used to eat.

62
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:18,950
When your master asks you to bark, bark.

63
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,250
 Finance Team 

64
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:29,980
 Finance Team Team Leader, Han Ji Yeong 

65
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:34,950
  'K-Savings Bank Manager... commits suicide by jumping off a building over gambling debt'  

66
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:39,310
 Hey, the Manager died after committing embezzlement. Is our bank going to close down? 

67
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:41,240
Gosh, do I have to look into a new job?

68
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,670
No way.

69
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:45,550
Hey, I heard he lost 100 billion won. On top of that,

70
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:47,890
I heard it's gambling debt.

71
00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:50,850
Who told you to gossip like that during your work hours?

72
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:09,960
Yes, this is Prosecutor Baek Joon Soo's office.

73
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:15,320
I have something to report regarding embezzlement at K-Savings Bank.

74
00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:18,390
K-Savings Bank?

75
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:26,160
Yes. Speak, please.

76
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:30,970
Manager Gye Choon Sik, the 100 billion won.

77
00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:34,070
He didn't lose that by gambling.

78
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:37,220
 That was done because someone ordered... 

79
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:39,820
Ordered? Who would that be?

80
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:43,110
But you'll keep this confidential, right?

81
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:46,890
Of course. Don't worry about anything. Relax.

82
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:53,470
This won't work. I'm sorry.

83
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:56,670
H-Hello?

84
00:08:02,130 --> 00:08:04,260
Find out who the caller is.

85
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:06,040
All right.

86
00:08:21,970 --> 00:08:25,390
Ahjussi, excuse me. I'm from the Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office.

87
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:27,870
I'm Inspector Go Gi Bong.

88
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:36,180
It's Team Leader Han Ji Yeong of K-Savings Bank's Finance Team.

89
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:49,360
Hello.

90
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:54,920
You called us, right?

91
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:57,110
No. I didn't do that.

92
00:08:57,110 --> 00:08:59,850
I heard you spoke alone often with the deceased manager.

93
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:01,510
You personally reported the financial status to him.

94
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:04,340
I've never done that. Why are you doing this?

95
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,180
Next. Gil Dae Ro.

96
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:16,710
K-Savings Bank case. How is it going?

97
00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:20,420
Yes, the manager's death will be concluded as suicide.

98
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:24,020
And even if there was embezzlement, there's no one to indict, so I plan to wrap it up.

99
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:25,450
I'll send you a report soon.

100
00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:27,820
Okay. Good job.

101
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:30,750
This is closed. Next?

102
00:09:31,210 --> 00:09:34,150
The death of a tenant at Gwangmin Officetel case.

103
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:35,740
Whose is it?

104
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:42,110
The prosecutors' office is the problem.

105
00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:50,600
It's the survey from the marriage consulting company that Han Ji Yeong registered in.

106
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:54,950
The first preferred occupation of the man she wants is doctor. The second place is also doctor.

107
00:09:54,950 --> 00:09:58,320
The probability of accepting the second date after meeting a blind date is also very high if he's a doctor.

108
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,520
Geez.

109
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:02,940
- What's Han Ji Yeong's schedule tomorrow? 
 - At 2 pm tomorrow,

110
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:06,370
she has an appointment at the Seoul University Hospital dermatology department.

111
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,800
 #1 preferred occupation: Doctor 

112
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,520
Okay. Let's set it up.

113
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:17,160
 Setting: A term used by con artists to describe a situation planned in advance to scam people 

114
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:26,680
Why is he not coming?

115
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:28,860
Did you see the fellow that's new in our psychiatry department?

116
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:30,450
- Brian Kim? 
 - Yeah.

117
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:32,110
He's so handsome, huh?

118
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:36,310
He's from Johns Hopkins. I heard he turned down an offer in the US and came to our hospital.

119
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:40,450
- Oh, he's handsome and capable! 
 - What's more important is...

120
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:43,210
- He's single! 
 - Oh, my.

121
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:44,990
He doesn't have a girlfriend?

122
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:50,360
- I hear he's waiting for a fateful woman like in the movies. Should I try to seduce him? 
 - Hey!

123
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:52,760
What do I do?

124
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:54,760
Hey, he's coming.

125
00:10:59,530 --> 00:11:02,020
Dr. Brian, did you eat?

126
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:03,130
Yes.

127
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:07,050
The self-mutilation patient that I consulted last time. When is he coming again?

128
00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:09,400
It was yesterday. He didn't come?

129
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:14,250
No. I saw some signs of Oedipism. 
 Oedipism: patients who deliberately and severely mutilate their eyes. 

130
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:16,420
Please call the guardian for now.

131
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:21,930
Lexapro and abil...
 Lexapro: Medication used to treat depression and anxiety 

132
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:29,740
I'll prepare Abilify. 
 Abilify: Medication used to treat mental/mood disorder 

133
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:32,000
And are you going to the seminar tomorrow?

134
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,690
I should. Thank you.

135
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:56,740
Oh, no! What's wrong?

136
00:11:57,710 --> 00:12:01,200
What do I do? I'm sorry.

137
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,570
What do I do?

138
00:12:02,570 --> 00:12:06,290
My neck...

139
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:11,050
What do I do? I'm sorry.

140
00:12:12,010 --> 00:12:15,290
I'm sorry, Doctor. The money for laundry...

141
00:12:15,290 --> 00:12:18,250
No, it's okay. This will do.

142
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:24,370
But, what brings you to the hospital? You must be sick?

143
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:28,540
Ah, no. Dermatology.

144
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:30,270
Ah, dermatology.

145
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:35,800
You must be stressed these days, right?

146
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,130
Pardon?

147
00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:41,930
Skin is the tissue that's closest to your brain.

148
00:12:41,930 --> 00:12:45,330
When you hurt yourself, you usually feel it saying, "Ouch."

149
00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:48,640
The information from the peripheral nervous system goes through the posterior ganglion...

150
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:51,650
and goes to the spine. And this information again...

151
00:12:51,650 --> 00:12:56,010
From spinal cord grey matter to the nociceptive neuron...

152
00:12:58,470 --> 00:13:02,410
I'm sorry. I deal with people a lot in my profession.

153
00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:03,640
Pardon?

154
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:06,330
Patients.

155
00:13:06,330 --> 00:13:12,870
In any case, the fact that you're having issues with your skin means... your name is?

156
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:14,400
Han Ji Yeong.

157
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:16,470
Han Ji Yeong.

158
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:22,260
It means there's a huge danger to your mental health, Han Ji Yeong.

159
00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:28,240
By chance, do you have a secret that you can't tell anyone about?

160
00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:32,580
If you look at the February issue of the Medical Science Journal,

161
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:34,900
people who keep secrets that they can't speak of

162
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:37,910
produce three times the amount of dopamine.

163
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:40,140
There's a research result that says that.

164
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:42,990
But if dopamine is produced  in excess or

165
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:47,280
if you're lack the substance to turn this dopamine into  norepinephrine,

166
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:52,910
a research result says it can cause mental illness.

167
00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:54,980
Then...

168
00:13:56,100 --> 00:14:04,570
I'm saying you should spill the secrets you hold inside of you to someone else as soon as possible.

169
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:18,470
 Seoul Medical Hospital 

170
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:37,170
Ji Yeong.

171
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:40,780
Are you busy today?

172
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:42,540
Today?

173
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:45,800
Then...

174
00:14:58,030 --> 00:15:00,830
Chamomile scent. It's nice, huh?

175
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:04,140
Herbs like this calm down your body and mind.

176
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:11,580
You open up your closed up heart and it is  effective for neuropathic relief.

177
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:18,170
Don't you feel like spilling all your secrets in a place like this?

178
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,650
Actually...

179
00:15:31,710 --> 00:15:37,240
Someone I know at my work...

180
00:15:39,610 --> 00:15:42,190
committed suicide.

181
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,500
I'm sorry.

182
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,900
I can't talk about it.

183
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:04,380
My mother makes great kimchi.

184
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:06,400
I wanted to give it to you.

185
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,190
Yes, yes.

186
00:16:08,190 --> 00:16:10,990
Thanks. I'll enjoy.

187
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:20,530
But I think you stopped right before you were going to say something important.

188
00:16:22,050 --> 00:16:26,790
As for that... Next time I see you...

189
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:28,540
Next time?

190
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:30,340
Yes.

191
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:32,640
Should we meet tomorrow?

192
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:36,040
Tomorrow, I...

193
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:39,110
Actually, starting the day after tomorrow,

194
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:41,700
I have to go to a psychiatry conference in Seattle.

195
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:45,710
And after that, I have to go directly to Spain to present my research.

196
00:16:45,710 --> 00:16:50,110
And after that, I have to go to Africa.

197
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:56,320
I only have time tomorrow.

198
00:17:02,770 --> 00:17:08,140
Then... see you tomorrow.

199
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:12,210
We'll meet here at the cafe at 7 pm.

200
00:17:12,210 --> 00:17:15,980
- Okay. Tomorrow night at 7 pm. 
 - Okay.

201
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:18,440
I'll see you tomorrow. I'll get going first.

202
00:17:25,690 --> 00:17:31,710
 Ttorae Ttorae Chicken 

203
00:17:38,010 --> 00:17:42,840
It's spicy. It's a spicy taste that makes you feel good.

204
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:45,050
This is a newly developed one. Is it okay?

205
00:17:45,050 --> 00:17:51,210
- Ah, yes. It's good, but I think it needs a finishing touch.
 - Finishing touch?

206
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:56,840
You have to eat with this in order for the taste to be doubly good.

207
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:58,850
Did you come to sell popcorn again?

208
00:17:58,850 --> 00:18:01,980
I asked you to evaluate the new menu items.

209
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:03,800
Mom, I'm home.

210
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,910
You're home.

211
00:18:05,910 --> 00:18:07,910
This is my daughter.

212
00:18:07,910 --> 00:18:10,850
Nice to meet you. The Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office, Criminal Division 6.

213
00:18:10,850 --> 00:18:13,130
You're Prosecutor Oh Ha Ra, right?

214
00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:14,710
Yes, you know me well?

215
00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:16,710
Have a seat.

216
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:19,170
To celebrate the fact that I'm meeting a star prosecutor...

217
00:18:19,170 --> 00:18:22,250
This is on me.

218
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:23,270
It's okay.

219
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:26,310
You won't be violating the bribery law.

220
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:28,810
Don't look down on rice puffs.

221
00:18:28,810 --> 00:18:34,020
Even in one kernal of popcorn, there is an intricate aesthetic.

222
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:35,530
Aesthetic?

223
00:18:35,530 --> 00:18:37,480
Now.

224
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:40,320
The rice grains are so small and trivial that they can easily slip through your fingers,

225
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:45,350
even when you hold it just a little tighter. But here,

226
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:46,650
if you add adequate pressure,

227
00:18:46,650 --> 00:18:50,610
and apply a physically altering element like heat on them, at last

228
00:18:50,610 --> 00:18:53,940
it reaches a point where chemical change occurs. Now,

229
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:56,620
shall we think from the rice's perspective?

230
00:18:56,620 --> 00:19:00,850
There's pressure on top and there's hot fire underneath.

231
00:19:00,850 --> 00:19:05,070
If it can bear this time of oppression and training,

232
00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:09,310
at last... it lets out a scream.

233
00:19:09,310 --> 00:19:11,080
How?

234
00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:17,280
Pop!

235
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:19,970
Yes. There was such a profound meaning.

236
00:19:19,970 --> 00:19:21,940
Oh, yes.

237
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:26,210
- Try some. 
 - Okay.

238
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:29,180
What are you doing?

239
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:30,790
So tired.

240
00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:33,210
Do Chan, how did your meeting with Team Leader Han go?

241
00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:35,930
Hyung, did I ever go over three days?

242
00:19:35,930 --> 00:19:39,470
Tomorrow night at 7 pm. Ding-dong-dang.

243
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:42,640
Hyungnim, good job.

244
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:45,960
That woman, seriously. She's got a taste.

245
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:50,670
It's really over tomorrow, right? You won't see her again, right?

246
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:57,250
Oh, yeah. She gave me some kimchi. I forgot and left it in the trunk.

247
00:19:57,250 --> 00:20:00,910
I don't want to eat kimchi!  Get out of my way.

248
00:20:00,910 --> 00:20:03,250
What's wrong with her?

249
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:14,320
We're inspecting. Can I check your trunk?

250
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:17,750
Yes. You're working so hard from early in the morning.

251
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:33,120
Everything looks good.

252
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:35,140
Thank you for your cooperation.

253
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:36,910
Have a good day.

254
00:20:41,050 --> 00:20:42,040
This is yummy.

255
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:44,650
Good morning.

256
00:20:44,650 --> 00:20:46,540
What's with the rice puffs early in the morning?

257
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:49,470
Prosecutor Oh said she got them from a good talker.

258
00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:53,320
As far as talking goes, he's in top 0.1% in Korea. You won't beat him either.

259
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:56,210
You're motivating my challenging nature as soon as I get to work.

260
00:20:56,210 --> 00:20:57,850
Do you know the aesthetics behind rice puffs?

261
00:20:57,850 --> 00:21:00,510
So, the uncooked rice grains may be small, but

262
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:03,870
if you apply a physical change like pressure and heat,

263
00:21:03,870 --> 00:21:06,870
it reaches a point where the chemical changes occur!

264
00:21:06,870 --> 00:21:08,850
Wow, the rice puff vendor said that?

265
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:11,260
Yes. And what else did he say?

266
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:15,020
You press it and apply heat...

267
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:17,540
When it endures the time of oppression and training,

268
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:21,700
- it is reborn in a new form. Something like that?
 - Whoa!

269
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:23,610
By chance, didn't he say something like this?

270
00:21:23,610 --> 00:21:28,520
If it endures that time, an amazing scream is let out. Pop, pop, pop!

271
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:32,400
Do you two know each other?

272
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:35,260
Nothing new when it comes to being a good talker.

273
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:40,020
- Galbitang (beef rib soup)? 
 - Galbitang.

274
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:42,550
Oh Ha Ra, what are you doing here?

275
00:21:42,550 --> 00:21:45,100
Didn't you see the news? Things are crazy right now!

276
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:46,180
Why?

277
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:48,940
Prosecutor, did you accept a bribe?

278
00:21:52,330 --> 00:21:54,780
 Exclusive: Prosecutor Baek was caught, receiving bribe 

279
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:04,750
You know Team Leader Han Ji Yeong of K-Savings Bank, right?

280
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:08,120
I heard she made a confession. A prosecutor coerced her and asked for a bribe.

281
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:10,210
That she had no choice but to offer it.

282
00:22:10,210 --> 00:22:12,780
Did you meat Team Leader Han Ji Yeong? Without my knowledge?

283
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:14,080
I told you to report to me everything!

284
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:16,500
I mean, I did meet her. I did, but

285
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:18,400
I didn't meet her trying to do something.

286
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,410
Stop making excuses.

287
00:22:19,410 --> 00:22:22,330
What? Are you two already in that kind of relationship?

288
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:28,030
There's something even more strange. Prosecutor Baek,

289
00:22:28,030 --> 00:22:31,530
I saw him by accident. At the hospital...

290
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:41,600
Prosecutor Baek Joon Soo! Is it true that you received a bribe?

291
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:44,020
Was it for the favor what you did or for what you will be doing for her?

292
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:45,080
Do you acknowledge it?

293
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:47,330
Please tell us!

294
00:22:47,330 --> 00:22:48,190
What happened?

295
00:22:48,190 --> 00:22:50,950
Prosecutor!

296
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:03,100
I think I'll catch a big one today.

297
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:04,470
What happened?

298
00:23:04,470 --> 00:23:06,620
The exact amount...

299
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:10,780
Just a moment. If you really want it that much, I'll show you.

300
00:23:17,370 --> 00:23:19,740
I received only some kimchi.

301
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:33,660
Do you acknowledge it?

302
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:35,480
Please tell us how much...

303
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:36,800
How much is it?

304
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:39,090
Was it intentional?

305
00:23:39,090 --> 00:23:42,180
Do you acknowledge the charges?

306
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:54,150
Are you admitting it?

307
00:23:54,150 --> 00:23:57,110
What happened?

308
00:24:01,330 --> 00:24:03,380
Please tell us!

309
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:06,910
I fell for an incredible switch.

310
00:24:07,610 --> 00:24:10,820
I think this will be a time of pressure and training.

311
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:22,750
Baek Joon Soo, it wasn't enough that you received a bribe. You brought it to the Prosecutors' Office so proudly?

312
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:24,690
I can't let this go.

313
00:24:24,690 --> 00:24:30,340
You're on suspension immediately! Leave your ID and get out!

314
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:41,320
 Government ID 
 Baek Joon Soo 
 Supreme Prosecutors' Office 

315
00:25:07,430 --> 00:25:09,850
It's all my fault.

316
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:17,100
When you first said to have him fill in, I should've stopped you, Prosecutor Oh.

317
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:20,580
I should've acted like a deputy prosecutor.

318
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:26,330
I was dragged around and it's come to this.

319
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:29,820
Deputy Prosecutor.

320
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:33,120
I feel so bad toward Joon Soo.

321
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:37,440
How would I face Joon Soo?

322
00:26:03,170 --> 00:26:07,970
♫  Your eyes that are red like the sunset  ♫

323
00:26:07,970 --> 00:26:12,330
 Prosecutor Baek Joon Soo 

324
00:26:12,330 --> 00:26:17,970
 Prosecutor Baek Joon Soo 

325
00:26:17,970 --> 00:26:21,320
I feel bad toward Prosecutor Baek.

326
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:24,740
♫  Standing lonely  ♫

327
00:26:25,970 --> 00:26:29,340
 Prosecutor Baek Joon Soo  
♫  The lighthouse in my dream  ♫

328
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:37,720
♫  Looks at me who is lost  ♫

329
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:43,960
♫  It's you, raise me, stay down for me  ♫

330
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:48,610
♫  Raise me up from far away  ♫

331
00:26:48,610 --> 00:26:53,280
♫  Stay with me  ♫

332
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:56,550
♫  By my side  ♫

333
00:26:57,610 --> 00:27:00,870
 Government ID 
 Baek Joon Soo 
 Supreme Prosecutors' Office 

334
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:17,260
I warned you.

335
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:22,170
A wrong method will bring about a wrong result.

336
00:27:25,210 --> 00:27:29,370
Sunbae, Do Chan explained to me on our way over. I think there was a misunderstanding.

337
00:27:29,370 --> 00:27:32,740
- If I take care of it— 
 - Don't make excuses.

338
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:39,560
Now that you've been hanging around con artists, did you become like them?

339
00:27:41,050 --> 00:27:43,500
Whose side are you on right now?

340
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:49,760
You made a huge mess.

341
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:30,250
I'll get my position back.

342
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:48,870
It turned out this way because someone like you is going around pretending to be me.

343
00:28:48,870 --> 00:28:51,560
So embarrassing.

344
00:28:56,250 --> 00:29:00,940
Con artist. Now,

345
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:02,700
get lost.

346
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:35,710
Baek Joon Soo, I hear he's being called to the disciplinary committee tomorrow.

347
00:29:35,710 --> 00:29:38,190
It's almost certain that he'll be dismissed.

348
00:29:43,370 --> 00:29:48,930
 Geum Tae Woong 

349
00:30:02,710 --> 00:30:04,640
This is Prosecutor Baek.

350
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:07,450
What brings you here at this hour?

351
00:30:07,450 --> 00:30:09,950
I'm here to sell a person.

352
00:30:09,950 --> 00:30:11,100
Did you see Prosecutor Baek's face?

353
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:14,390
He looked totally scary. Looked like he was about to eat us up.

354
00:30:14,390 --> 00:30:17,400
I thought he was a model student, but he's all twisted up inside.

355
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:19,960
Let's go inside. There's some soju leftover in the dressing room, right?

356
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:23,130
What? Don't you think we're justified in our anger?

357
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:38,480
This is a gallery. We buy and sell paintings.

358
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:39,430
A person...

359
00:30:39,430 --> 00:30:44,360
If I say a fake Baek Joon Soon, is he worth a sale?

360
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:47,910
Fake Baek Joon Soo?

361
00:30:47,910 --> 00:30:51,390
There's a con artist who's been pretending to be me all this time.

362
00:30:51,390 --> 00:30:54,500
By chance, didn't you know?

363
00:30:56,150 --> 00:30:58,200
A con artist?

364
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:04,920
Sa Do Chan.

365
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:09,310
Sa Do Chan?

366
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:25,910


367
00:31:27,310 --> 00:31:30,280
♫  Crazy other world  ♫

368
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:34,310
♫  Crazy&nbsp; A Choice like fate  ♫

369
00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:39,310

370
00:31:39,310 --> 00:31:42,300
♫  Crazy Never Ending  ♫
