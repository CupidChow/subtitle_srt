1
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:24,070
He's more fearless than I thought, Sa Do Chan.

2
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:29,030
Please don't worry. The police force commander is my colleague.

3
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:31,940
I placed him secretly.

4
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:33,700
Thank you.

5
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:37,910
What will you do if you catch Sa Do Chan?

6
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:40,000
I'll hand him over to the police.

7
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:45,000
No. Give him to me.

8
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,900
Hand him over to me entirely.

9
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:53,280
And don't ask me about him after that.

10
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:58,790
This is a trap, right?

11
00:00:58,790 --> 00:01:01,750
I heard you placed a police force on standby.

12
00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:06,210
"Don't ask me how he's doing."

13
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:10,850
Sa Do Chan, it seems you plan to kill him.

14
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:20,890
 Timing and

15
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:40,480
 A vehicle is approaching the area. 

16
00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:47,070
Guard it well.

17
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:57,050
  You have arrived at your destination.  

18
00:01:57,050 --> 00:01:59,500
 This is the end of directions. 

19
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:55,690
I'm here to deliver the lobster.

20
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,600
Are you perhaps filming a movie?

21
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:41,590
Are they playing with me?

22
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:50,130
Russia is requesting that you return the Fabergé egg.

23
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,770
Tell them to take it.

24
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:14,700
The Fabergé egg is going back to Russia.

25
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:18,300
It's just an egg. We weren't going after that initially anyway.

26
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:24,600
Why would we steal a Russian cultural artifact? Am I right?

27
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:27,860
The king we are after is something else.

28
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:30,510
- Turn the monitor on. 
 -  Okay.

29
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:41,340
That there is today's big store. 
   Big store: con men's term for the location where the con occurs.  

30
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:58,110
  Switch  

31
00:04:58,110 --> 00:05:01,750
  Secrets Dissipate and Truth is Revealed  

32
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:06,480
 Former Chief Prosecutor Jeong Do Yeong who attended his retirement ceremony from the Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office, 

33
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:10,150
 left the prosecutors' office in the midst of farewells given by his hoobae prosecutors. 

34
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:12,670
 With his reputation as an upright prosecutor, 

35
00:05:12,670 --> 00:05:15,570
 the former chief prosecutor had the trust of the people. 

36
00:05:15,570 --> 00:05:20,070
 It has become clearer that he'll enter the special election for the Assembly. 

37
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:26,610
Should I address you as Chief Prosecutor Jin now?

38
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:28,590
Please take care of the rest.

39
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:33,110
Yes. I'll do my very best.

40
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:42,190
The politics that people want. I'll practice politics in the most ethical way.

41
00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:48,070
We have to catch him while he's still inside our fence.

42
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:51,110
Don't you think that moron is climbing up too tall of a ladder?

43
00:05:57,790 --> 00:06:01,390
Due to the nature of the content, please pay special attention.

44
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:03,620
You've arrived?

45
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:06,490
They're from the Cultural Heritage Administration and Korea Customs Service.

46
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:09,610
I'm Prosecutor Oh Ha Ra who requested your assistance.

47
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:16,740
I have a warrant.

48
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,000
The article?

49
00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:25,900
It's almost finished.

50
00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:40,570
Our Namsan Club's young blood,

51
00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:44,960
Prosecutor Baek Joon Soo of Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office.

52
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:54,850
This is Manager Hong Gi Seop of Industry Development Bank.

53
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:01,560
This is Executive Director Joo Gi Yeong of JK Group's Strategy Team.

54
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:06,260
He's the grandson of Executive Director Lee Gi Ram of Boram Private School Foundation.

55
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:10,200
The Chief Editor of Moogoong Daily News, Song Jeong Hyeok.

56
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:13,240
Director Cha Hoon Myeong of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

57
00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:16,920
Here.

58
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:31,010
There are many people who are not present today, but they'll get to meet him eventually.

59
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:34,650
I'm sure everyone saw the news. The Chief Prosecutor Jeong Do Yeong

60
00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:37,400
took his first step into the political arena.

61
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:40,330
With all the power we have in our Namsan Club,

62
00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:42,690
let's make sure Former Chief Prosecutor Jeong wins the nomination by a landslide.

63
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:47,140
Furthermore, let's work on him winning the presidency.

64
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:49,920
Let's do our best, together.

65
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:59,120
Cheers to Former Chief Prosecutor's landslide win!

66
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,920
Cheers!

67
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:19,160
Is Seong Do working hard these days?

68
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:22,250
He says he's looking for him very hard.

69
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:26,160
- Let's go to Jo Seong Do's office. 
 - Okay.

70
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,910
Look at you...

71
00:08:57,580 --> 00:08:59,800
You gamble away the company money.

72
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:02,080
You get caught selling drugs behind our backs.

73
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:05,910
When are you going to start living like a human being?

74
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:10,440
The people who are much smarter than you and come from better homes work hard enough to have their heads spin.

75
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:13,800
But then you, you. Just why!

76
00:09:17,210 --> 00:09:20,160
Let's not drag out our relationship.

77
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:24,270
If you don't want to work get out. Let's cut our ties here.

78
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:29,160
I'm sorry! Please, give me another chance!

79
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:32,480
How much longer are you going to blame your past and your environment?

80
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,730
If you want to work with me, stop blaming other people!

81
00:09:34,730 --> 00:09:37,550
Become the person you want to be!

82
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:40,660
CEO, if you give me one more chance,

83
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:43,710
I'll go as far as pretend to die.

84
00:09:47,770 --> 00:09:52,850
If you don't think, try to even pretend to be thinking.

85
00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:57,600
If you're not sophisticated, just try to pretend.

86
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,380
If you don't have it, just pretend to have it.

87
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:03,480
That's what you call "packaging!"

88
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:07,290
Is it so hard!

89
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:29,650
Seriously...

90
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:49,800
 1 year ago 

91
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,570
 Who are you? 

92
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:38,170
I'm her sunbae from her hometown. I heard the news and came.

93
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:40,970
 How are you related to her? 

94
00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:43,010
 She's my mom. 

95
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:02,650
 It's been about 10 years since she's been living in the nursing home. 

96
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:07,110
 That's why I couldn't reach her... 

97
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:11,080
 What do you do now? 

98
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:19,460
 I've done some smuggling... I've sold some drugs. 

99
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:24,430
 Thanks to that, I've been in and out of jail a few times. 

100
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:44,170
Even though I seem so pathetic, I have a clear goal for my life.

101
00:12:44,170 --> 00:12:46,230
 Your life's goal? 

102
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:48,860
 To find my birth father 

103
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:54,030
 Your father? And if you do? 

104
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:56,310
 I'll kill him. 

105
00:12:58,060 --> 00:13:02,670
 Having his own son, he ran away. How can he call himself a father? 

106
00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:09,140
 My mom. She got sick missing him all her life. 

107
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:17,150
 In the end... In the end, she died this way. 

108
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:24,110
 If I find my father, I'll definitely kill him. 

109
00:13:36,730 --> 00:13:40,770
 That mission I think I may be able to help with. 

110
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:49,320
 I want to do something for you as your sunbae from your hometown. 

111
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:55,270
 Would you like to work with me? 

112
00:14:03,890 --> 00:14:08,520
When will you look like a human being?

113
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:16,950
My proud Reporter Oh So Ra. Are you going on an interview?

114
00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:19,570
What's with you? Calling me praiseworthy?

115
00:14:19,570 --> 00:14:21,970
- To where? 
 - To Former Chief Prosecutor Jeong Do Yeong's home.

116
00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:25,090
He called all the reporters from the press.

117
00:14:25,090 --> 00:14:28,560
Really? I guess he's going to show you something amazing.

118
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:31,500
How could there be such a thing? Now that he's moving on as a politician,

119
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:36,140
a happy couple, frugal lifestyle, humanity, showing off. Stuff like that.

120
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:41,090
He's got much more than what you imagine.

121
00:14:41,690 --> 00:14:45,960
Reporter Oh. A reporter should know how to ask good questions.

122
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,860
Isn't that basic?

123
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:50,590
If you're curious don't hold it in and ask your question.

124
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:52,380
That's given. Why do you keep asking me this?

125
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:54,170
Reporter Oh, let's get going.

126
00:14:54,170 --> 00:14:56,020
I'm off.

127
00:14:57,340 --> 00:14:59,930
You have to ask if you're curious about anything!

128
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:08,410
 Frivolous One 

129
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:27,890


130
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,570
Oh... nice.

131
00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:35,840
You look so great together.

132
00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:40,310
Can we rest for a moment?

133
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,580
She must be tired.

134
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:48,280
No, no. Just a moment.

135
00:15:56,670 --> 00:16:01,480
I just want to live quietly.

136
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:06,120
When a husband wants to do this, you're not being helpful.  I should ...

137
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:15,160
Candidate Jeong, all your furniture looks old.

138
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:18,490
I can see how thrifty you are, Candidate.

139
00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:24,230
That's right. This is furniture we bought when we got married.

140
00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:27,020
You've heard the phrase, "Oldies, but goodies," right?

141
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:30,240
Old things are good.

142
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:37,910
In Tae, now.

143
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:39,370
Okay.

144
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:48,530
  Candidate "A", former Chief Prosecutor Illegally Smuggled Chinese Cultural Artifacts,  Terracotta Warriors 

145
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:54,300
There's only one person who used to be a prosecutor in this election.

146
00:16:57,100 --> 00:17:02,300
Candidate Jeong, by any chance, do you possibly know the Terracotta Warriors?

147
00:17:04,870 --> 00:17:08,620
This is an article about the suspicion that someone may have smuggled from the  Mausoleum of the Terracotta Warriors.

148
00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:14,700
Smuggling the Terracotta Warriors? No way.

149
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:17,590
Isn't this Chinese cultural artifact?

150
00:17:17,590 --> 00:17:21,060
Are you saying this article is baseless?

151
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:23,770
Yes. None.

152
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:36,140
What's that? Smoke?

153
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:38,700
There's smoke. There's smoke.

154
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:41,450
What's going on? Over there.

155
00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:45,340
I'll put it out. Please don't come down.

156
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:52,080
Okay! Nice timing!

157
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:06,420
Hey, let's go.

158
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:08,290
Let's go.

159
00:18:08,290 --> 00:18:10,010
What's going on?

160
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:16,540
Should we remove the veil that was hiding the truth?

161
00:18:17,210 --> 00:18:20,230
Switch on.

162
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:28,240
No, no, no.

163
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,550
- Not here. 
 - Oh, my!

164
00:18:30,550 --> 00:18:32,710
Don't come.

165
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:35,570
Please step aside.

166
00:18:35,570 --> 00:18:38,350
No. No. Don't record.

167
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:40,390
Don't film.

168
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:44,190
Whoa. Amazing.

169
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:50,760
Look at this. Record quickly.

170
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:52,720
Whoa, the article was right.

171
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:55,390
One, two.

172
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:11,210
Prosecutor Oh, the setting here is done.

173
00:19:11,210 --> 00:19:14,660
Good job. Sa Do Chan.

174
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:19,520
When a prosecutor and con artist combine forces, they are unbeatable.

175
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,970
Please go,raid team.

176
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:45,130
Okay!

177
00:19:45,130 --> 00:19:47,560
Yeah! Yeah!

178
00:19:57,010 --> 00:20:00,230
CEO, what happened to that exhibit?

179
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:04,700
It was a prank by a mythomaniac. Nothing happened

180
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:10,420
thanks to our Prosecutor Baek who came by in person with the police force.

181
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:11,590
I am flattered.

182
00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:17,000
As I expected, who in Korea can target the CEO's gallery?

183
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:30,750
CEO, there's trouble.

184
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:31,490
Trouble?

185
00:20:31,490 --> 00:20:34,610
The Terracotta Warriors were discovered at Candidate Jeong Do Yeong's home.

186
00:20:36,730 --> 00:20:39,140
What?

187
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:40,770
Really?

188
00:20:44,470 --> 00:20:47,870
 A day before 

189
00:20:47,870 --> 00:20:53,520
What do you mean the Faberge opened up? I heard the exhibit got canceled.

190
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:56,390
It was nothing much. Don't worry.

191
00:20:56,390 --> 00:20:57,990
How can I not worry?

192
00:20:57,990 --> 00:21:02,450
That means they penetrated the security system and placed their installation.

193
00:21:02,450 --> 00:21:05,430
They have extraordinary skill.

194
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:09,800
This won't do. I'm going to have to take my kids.

195
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:13,560
Now that I see you, you're very selfish, Chief Prosecutor.

196
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:18,750
I thought you came by out of concern for the gallery, but you want your items?

197
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:21,060
I'm nervous.

198
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:24,590
Take them with you, if you're so uneasy.

199
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:36,000
Those bastards. Were they after this?

200
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:42,410
 From the house of Candidate Jeong in Democratic party, 10 Terracotta Warriors were found 

201
00:21:42,410 --> 00:21:44,710
 which are suspected to be smuggled. 

202
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:47,230
 Candidate Jeong is insisting that they're fake. 

203
00:21:47,230 --> 00:21:51,230
 The Customs Service which was dispatched on a tip took the Terracotta Warriors. 

204
00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:54,590
 The Cultural Heritage Administration will cooperate with the Chinese Cultural Administration 

205
00:21:54,590 --> 00:21:57,450
 to verify the  authenticity of the Terracotta Warriors. 

206
00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:03,760
Jeong Do Yeong is the case of, "a thief has a bad conscience and is apt to give himself away."

207
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:07,080
As a consequence, he took out all the Terracotta Warriors by himself from Feel Gallery.

208
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:10,930
Our Oppa Do Chan is so smart. How could he come up with such an idea?

209
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:14,980
This is one of the war strategies from the book, "Art of War" by Sun Tzu.

210
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:19,290
"Make a noise in the east and strike the west," ( seongdong kyeokseo 聲東擊西 )

211
00:22:19,290 --> 00:22:21,400
Seongdong Police Station?

212
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:28,170
I know, I know. Can't you take a joke?

213
00:22:28,170 --> 00:22:31,290
- You know? 
 - I do.

214
00:22:31,290 --> 00:22:33,070
I said I know.

215
00:22:33,070 --> 00:22:35,120
You really know?

216
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:50,250
Bring him no matter what.

217
00:22:50,250 --> 00:22:51,060
What?

218
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:55,450
I really need this man.

219
00:22:59,170 --> 00:23:02,070
Prosecutor Oh, I found Sa Do Chan.

220
00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:06,230
Thank you. Keep up the good work.

221
00:23:49,850 --> 00:23:55,430
Sa Do Chan? Isn't he your son?

222
00:23:56,730 --> 00:24:00,730
How much longer will you avoid Do Chan and live in hiding?

223
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:06,040
No, I am so ashamed.

224
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:11,090
As a father, how can I appear in front of him after 20 years?

225
00:24:11,090 --> 00:24:15,620
"I ruined your life." How can I tell him that?

226
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:21,920
I can't do it.

227
00:24:23,930 --> 00:24:26,040
I can't do it.

228
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:51,310
What they were after weren't the Faberge egg.

229
00:24:51,310 --> 00:24:56,850
They were after the Terracotta Warriors. The King I was going to bring up,

230
00:24:56,850 --> 00:25:00,150
they were after the Chief Prosecutor!

231
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:07,420
How dare they play around with Geum Tae Woong?

232
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:12,250
I am the person to deceive others, not the one to be fooled by others.

233
00:25:12,250 --> 00:25:14,840
The problem is Jo Seong Doo.

234
00:25:15,610 --> 00:25:19,860
I heard Jo Seong Doo came by the gallery office a week ago.

235
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:21,040
Why was he there?

236
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:27,070
He took all the blueprints of this gallery, saying he has to deliver it to an architect's office.

237
00:25:27,070 --> 00:25:30,560
I contacted the architect's office but he was lying.

238
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:40,330
Jo Seong Doo. Don't you think he's working with Sa Do Chan?

239
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:45,320
Go find him right now! Drag him here right now!

240
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:46,850
Yes sir.

241
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:09,400
Jo Seong Doo!

242
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:16,370
 Jo Seong Doo 

243
00:26:36,910 --> 00:26:40,530
Hyung. What's with you again?

244
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:47,460
It will all work out. Don't be so worried.

245
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:50,290
I feel ashamed.

246
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:54,450
I still feel like it happened yesterday.

247
00:26:54,450 --> 00:26:56,990
The incident from six years ago.

248
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:01,110
 Six years ago 

249
00:27:01,110 --> 00:27:03,700
 You've worked hard for six years. Tomorrow is the day 

250
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:05,460
 you can succeed. 

251
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:07,160
 Good luck with your bar exam. 

252
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:10,260
 - Fighting!
 - Fighting! 

253
00:27:21,170 --> 00:27:25,260
 Do Chan, you ranked the first place for the last mock test. 

254
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:27,710
 Are you going to place first at this rate? 

255
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:31,200
 -Do Chan. 

256
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,780
 Oh, Hyung 

257
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:37,890
 Let's go 

258
00:27:40,570 --> 00:27:44,560
 I won't have to worry about your exam tomorrow, right? Prosecutor Sa Do Chan. 

259
00:27:45,270 --> 00:27:47,370
 How about you? Is the movie prep going well? 

260
00:27:47,370 --> 00:27:52,560
 The casting is almost done. I think I am going to start shooting next month. 

261
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:54,300
 That's great. 

262
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:58,190
 Your script was great. Director Bong... 

263
00:28:01,490 --> 00:28:04,890
 In any case, Bong Man Gyu is driving me crazy. 

264
00:28:04,890 --> 00:28:07,380
 Why? Did your brother get himself in trouble again? 

265
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:11,860
 He seems to hang around with smugglers. 

266
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:16,800
 I am going to visit him tomorrow and punish him. 

267
00:28:18,570 --> 00:28:20,650
 Five. 

268
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:23,170
 SIx. 

269
00:28:23,170 --> 00:28:26,970
 Seven. Eight. 

270
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:30,960
 Nine. Ten. 

271
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:42,510
 Prosecutor, are you kidding me? What do you mean a receipt for smuggled items? 

272
00:28:42,510 --> 00:28:45,630
 I have to be prepared just in case. 

273
00:28:45,630 --> 00:28:48,850
 I bought these not knowing they were smuggled items. 

274
00:28:49,850 --> 00:28:52,930
 You really are a prosecutor, huh? 

275
00:28:52,930 --> 00:28:55,810
 Right. How much do you want me to write per unit (on the receipt)? 

276
00:28:55,810 --> 00:28:57,850
 - One million won.
 - Are you crazy? 

277
00:28:57,850 --> 00:29:00,920
 These are authentic cultural artifacts. You promised me to pay 1 billion won per unit. 

278
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:04,290
 I'm saying just write it like that on the receipt. 

279
00:29:23,130 --> 00:29:25,300
 Here, 10 million won. 

280
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:30,590
 What a con artist. 

281
00:29:30,590 --> 00:29:33,860
 You told me to write like that just on the receipt. 

282
00:29:34,550 --> 00:29:37,120
 You stole them anyway. 

283
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:42,530
 Do you want me to charge you for breaking the preservation law for cultural artifacts and stealing overseas? 

284
00:29:43,190 --> 00:29:46,610
 Whoa, what a total thug. 

285
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:52,880
 Man Gyu! 

286
00:29:54,450 --> 00:29:56,460
 You're here, right? 

287
00:30:10,930 --> 00:30:11,100
