1
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:06,200
Ah. Hold on.

2
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:12,750
To be honest, I'm not Baek Joon Soo.

3
00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:23,580
I look a lot like him, right? As one lives, such things happen.

4
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:27,110
You might not believe it, but it's a bit complicated.

5
00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:31,710
When you are about to die, what wouldn't you say? Then, goodbye.

6
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:34,350
I said I'm not Baek Joon Soo...

7
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:42,090
 Timing and

8
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:45,460
- What's going on? 
 - Get out of the way!

9
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:50,130
Stop!

10
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:16,030
I have something to tell you, sir.

11
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:20,280
The thing is, I need some money in order to go into hiding.

12
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:23,600
Since he worked hard, take good care of him.

13
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,360
Thank you.

14
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:36,480
The drawing is now ruined.

15
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:38,860
I'm sorry.

16
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:03,340
I said I'm really alright.

17
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:05,580
Look, I'm perfectly fine.

18
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:08,080
Oppa, let's stop this already.

19
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,610
Do you know how scared I was?

20
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:12,210
Getting kidnapped is something that didn't happen when you were a con artist.

21
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:14,820
I guess being a prosecutor is not safe.

22
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:18,820
This is all that woman, Prosecutor Oh's, fault

23
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:22,110
- Hey 
 - Why are you doing things without saying anything?

24
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:26,270
You said it would take a while to catch the main culprit when my way is faster.

25
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:27,700
You wouldn't agree to that.

26
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:31,390
If you caught him that way, did you think anyone would be thankful?

27
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:44,400
You've failed for the second time. Very unlike you.

28
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:48,840
I'm sorry. Someone threw a  gas grenade unexpectedly.

29
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:51,700
It seems there's someone backing Prosecutor Baek.

30
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:54,330
It's not from the prosecutor's or police's side?

31
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:59,960
I don't think so. He had a prosthetic hand.

32
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,690
A prosthetic?

33
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:06,360
A trap?

34
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:09,720
From the beginning, they knew me as Baek Joon Soo.

35
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:14,040
They intended to get me to the slaughterhouse by using a pregnant person as bait.

36
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:19,130
Prosecutor Baek's car accident was not normal, right?

37
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:27,820
Prosecutor Baek and I both got into an accident before going to meet Nam Seung Tae.

38
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:33,500
Get Nam Seung Tae. He is in danger.

39
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:38,110
He's dead. At Mount Bukhan.

40
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:45,910
You brought me to this kind of dangerous case?

41
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:49,740
That's why I told you to stay still. Why did you make things even more dangerous?

42
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:54,170
Dangerous? Prosecutor Oh Ha Ra, you are the one who put me in the most dangerous situation.

43
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:57,090
I almost died without knowing the reason!

44
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:01,810
What exactly are you investigating?

45
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:04,310
What is the item you tired to get?

46
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,850
There's no need for you to know.

47
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:13,390
You used me all you wanted, but you won't tell me the details of the investigation?

48
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:20,330
Rather than get killed like a dog as Baek Joon Soo,

49
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:23,450
it is better for a con artist to go to jail.

50
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:29,290
I am going to meet the reporters. If you change your mind, come see me there.

51
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:33,710
Hey. Sa Do Chan! Are you crazy?

52
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:36,760
What will happen if you reveal all that? We'll all get buried.

53
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:38,270
That is why tell me!

54
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:41,670
I need to know who the people are. The ones who are trying to kill me!

55
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:46,890
So that I can prepare my heart whether to run away or face them.

56
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:53,860
Prosecutor Baek, what did he investigate?

57
00:06:57,890 --> 00:06:59,900
Drugs.

58
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:03,620
Drugs?

59
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:07,230
They look down on the prosecutor and try to trample him, twice already.

60
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:13,290
They're not just a drug-dealing organization. They're powerful people who can even move the prosecutors' office and foreign countries.

61
00:07:17,690 --> 00:07:22,260
 They've been ordering foreign diplomats to transport drugs secretly for the last several years, 

62
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:25,460
 - using a diplomatic pouch. 
 - A diplomatic pouch? 

63
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:27,660
 It's a bag that a diplomat carries into the country. 

64
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:31,760
 The items inside that bag are not subject to customs instpection. 
 Consulate 003-015. 

65
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:36,680
 Abusing this diplomatic privilege, they've brought in illegal weapons and even corpses from other countries. 

66
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:42,240
 I'm sure the enormous amount of dirty money they make becomes more power for them. 

67
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:46,920
 Amazing power that is enough to ignore judges and prosecutors. 

68
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:52,960
Then,  what was the item that you wanted to receive from Nam Seung Tae?

69
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:57,030
The usb video that recorded the drug ring leader.

70
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:02,060
Who is the drug ring leader?

71
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:04,280
We don't know at all.

72
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:10,680
Since that video was our only clue, we tried everything to obtain it.

73
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:17,030
Ah, right. The only thing we know about him is the nickname.

74
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:19,580
Brown Bear.

75
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,360
Brown Bear?

76
00:08:37,970 --> 00:08:40,350
 Switch 

77
00:08:40,350 --> 00:08:44,530
  03 The one who can say that I am me  

78
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:51,090
- Oppa.
 - Hyung.

79
00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:14,520
 Bool Gom (Brown Bear) ... Person in charge 
  Drugs:   Master of Millions 

80
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:23,260
Do Chan. What's the problem?

81
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:26,580
Prosecutor Baek was looking for Brown Bear.

82
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:30,830
Brown Bear? The guy you are looking for?

83
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:34,650
Could that Brown Bear be the "Brown Bear"?

84
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:40,490
I need to find out. That's why I must continue being Prosecutor Baek.

85
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:45,280
Brown Bear, please.

86
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:52,050
Brown Bear, please don't be like this.

87
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:55,630
Brown Bear, please.

88
00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:07,500
Twenty years. Twenty years. I need to find it.

89
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,560
Prosecutor Baek  Joon Soo.

90
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:27,670
 Brown Bear? 

91
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:35,590
He looked like he knew something.

92
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:41,320
I spoke with Sa Do Chan

93
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:44,450
Since he's so reckless, I told him to quit.

94
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:45,980
He said he can't do it because it is too dangerous.

95
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:49,430
Okay, it could be better.

96
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:52,420
Hey, let's wrap this up as well.

97
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:57,770
Wrap it up? We can't just close the case like that.

98
00:10:57,770 --> 00:11:00,270
At least we should dig deeper.

99
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:10,090
Nam Seung Tae is dead. Prosecutor Baek is down. There's also no evidence.

100
00:11:10,090 --> 00:11:14,390
What do we dig for? There is no way.

101
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:23,690
There's no Prosecutor Baek. There's no Sa Do Chan either.

102
00:11:23,690 --> 00:11:26,630
So which one of them do you want to have?

103
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:28,360
What are you doing?

104
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:34,650
Who did you miss more? Me or Baek Joon Soo?

105
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:38,650
Well?  The saying is if I can't have a pheasant, I'll accept a chicken. I'll say you for now.

106
00:11:38,650 --> 00:11:41,340
Wow ... to compare me to a chicken...

107
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:43,220
I thought you ran away scared.

108
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:46,880
Where would I go? I'm the only witness.

109
00:11:53,210 --> 00:11:56,860
 Where there are drugs then there must be money, right? 

110
00:11:56,860 --> 00:12:01,160
 Think about it. Right now I'm taking on Prosecutor Baek Joon Soo's identity. 

111
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:07,160
 If we utilize this and do a great setting, we can get their money big time and go away. 

112
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:10,570
 I don't like it. What if you get into a dangerous situation again after being a prosecutor? 

113
00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:13,140
 We can't just live on like this. 

114
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:16,790
 Since it's a huge job, it's perfect as a finale of our careers. 

115
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:18,910
You came again to give an eyewitness account?

116
00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:21,410
Well, it's not just because of that.

117
00:12:21,410 --> 00:12:26,300
I'm not a real prosecutor so I can't investigate but I came to help you out.

118
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:27,790
 Will Prosecutor Oh believe that? 

119
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:32,190
 Of course, she won't. So I have to convince her. 

120
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,540
 With sincerity. 

121
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:39,400
You must be joking. I don't know what you are up to, but if you plan to run away again—

122
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:43,700
That was when I didn't know anything. The situation is different now.

123
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:48,350
We have to catch the guys who put a hole in my head. And you keep going on a dangerous path.

124
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:50,590
Well, I could protect you too.

125
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:52,810
You? Me?

126
00:12:52,810 --> 00:12:55,610
Just don't go around getting beaten.

127
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:01,460
Anyway. Let's do well.

128
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:06,030
As of now, we've become one team as prosecutors.

129
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:07,520
You made a wrong choice in your words.

130
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,860
A prosecutor and a conman are alike.

131
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:13,190
A prosecutor and a conman join hands.

132
00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:16,390
Well, let's move forward working hard. That's what I'm saying.

133
00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:19,930
A combination of the Prosecutors' Office's outsider and a dumba**?

134
00:13:19,930 --> 00:13:24,780
Wow, you are both a dream collaboration. You look good together.

135
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:30,140
Hey, Prosecutor Baek, you graduated from the same university as me. But you never show up at our alumni gatherings.

136
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:34,710
Ah, that's right, that's right. My school year is lower, but I'm your sunbae in terms of prosecuting years.

137
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:37,670
You know, right? Passing an exam at younger age.

138
00:13:38,530 --> 00:13:40,580
How smart am I.

139
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:43,480
In any case, come out to the alumni gatherings even if you don't feel like it.

140
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:47,730
You need to strengthen your connections with sunbaes and hoobaes. This is all an investment in your future...

141
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:54,130
Well, I don't think you'll get anywhere by doing that though.

142
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:58,130
Your school probably doesn't even have an alumni association.

143
00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:05,240
That a**hole is that Gil Dae Ro, right?

144
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:08,000
In work or personal affairs, he's someone you must watch out for.

145
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,500
In physiognomy, guys who look like that are good at annoying people.

146
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:14,260
How can his back view be so unbearable to see?

147
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:17,880
There are some people whom you naturally dislike for no good reason.

148
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:22,670
I think we match well when we curse others.

149
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:24,670
Nice!

150
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:27,800
Team Leader Kim, you failed twice already.

151
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:33,020
For the health of the organization, you have to cut out the mistakes right away. Don't you think so, CEO?

152
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:35,870
I won't say that I didn't make any mistakes.

153
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:40,760
But, I couldn't have expected that someone would show up at that warehouse.

154
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:43,500
Team Leader Kim, if a person does that, they become useless.

155
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:47,860
The world's biggest loser is the one who makes a mistake and makes excuses by blaming other things.

156
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:49,600
Isn't that right, Boss?

157
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:53,900
Enough already. What did you do right?

158
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:56,010
There's something that doesn't make sense.

159
00:14:56,010 --> 00:15:00,480
You know how he said he met Prosecutor Baek on the desert island on the same day that he got into the car accident in Sokcho?

160
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,790
Was that on the same day?

161
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:06,340
It was 1pm when Mr. Jo said he saw Prosecutor Baek on the desert island.

162
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:11,910
The car accident happened at 3pm. He went from Incheon to Sokcho in 2 hours? ( a distance of 186 km )

163
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:14,470
There's even that phrase, "Sudden appearance and disappearance from nowhere."

164
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:19,070
I've driven from Seoul to Mokpo in an hour and a half. ( 311 km) You threw an innocent person into the ocean. 

165
00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:24,600
I've been monitoring Baek Joon Soo continuously from Sokcho. It wasn't an innocent person.

166
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:28,250
I followed him to the prosecutors' office and checked him out.

167
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:33,320
If not, you were deceived by a guy who called himself a prosecutor, Mr. Jo.

168
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:36,150
Mr. Jo, go to Sokcho.

169
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:41,220
If in fact, he did come alive from that sea, he must have been hospitalized.

170
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:42,820
Yes!

171
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:47,130
If Boss Kim  had completed everything without fault, I wouldn't have to work like this.

172
00:15:47,130 --> 00:15:51,050
I'll be sure to look everywhere and bring back the big harvest.

173
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:40,660
The plan was good.

174
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:45,380
As you anticipated, CEO Geum, Prosecutor Baek did grab onto it right away.

175
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:48,760
I apologize. My carelessness was big.

176
00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:52,980
Don't you have to revise your method?

177
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:55,970
But, he is a Korean prosecutor after all.

178
00:16:55,970 --> 00:17:01,240
If something goes wrong after going on like this, many people will be in a tough situation.

179
00:17:02,410 --> 00:17:08,040
Since you're obtained the video clip, let's take care of it in a way that won't create any chaos.

180
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:12,810
I understand what you are trying to say. We will revise our method.

181
00:17:12,810 --> 00:17:19,260
But is it really Prosecutor Baek Joon Soo?

182
00:17:20,130 --> 00:17:22,570
What do you mean by that?

183
00:17:22,570 --> 00:17:25,400
I can't truly guarantee anything.

184
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:31,710
I have a feeling that we might be dealing with a phantom.

185
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:47,500
- Did you find it? 
 - Because it's such an isolated area, there's no CCTV or witnesses.

186
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:50,910
I think it will be difficult to pinpoint what kind of car came in.

187
00:17:53,150 --> 00:17:55,500
Over there, did you discover anything?

188
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:59,190
It's clean. There's no fingerprints as of yet.

189
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:04,670
For now, why don't you go back to the prosecutors' office? The montage should be ready as well by now.

190
00:18:04,670 --> 00:18:06,090
Yes.

191
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:13,040
It's him?

192
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:17,290
Yes, it looks like him. But he looks better here than he does in real life.

193
00:18:17,290 --> 00:18:19,700
Please distribute the montage to all the police stations nationwide and put him on the wanted list.

194
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:20,940
Yes, I understand.

195
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:23,290
Ah, right. What happened with the Hongdae office?

196
00:18:23,290 --> 00:18:25,390
He died without a trace.

197
00:18:25,390 --> 00:18:28,160
These people. Do they run a cleaning service on the side?

198
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:33,250
The weather is still very chilly. Warm yourself with green tea.

199
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:34,620
I will drink well.

200
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:38,310
Oh my, these are teacups that I've never seen before.

201
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:40,630
It's pretty. I will drink well, Section Chief Go.

202
00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:44,850
Drink it before it cools. Prosecutor Baek, you should have one as well.

203
00:18:44,850 --> 00:18:48,580
I ate a chip. My hands are a bit... I'll go wash my hands.

204
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:01,480
- It's delicious, Section Chief Go. 
- I put my effort into it.

205
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:08,790
I will take care of it for you.

206
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:12,870
Ah, yes. I drank well. As expected, Bosung green tea is good.

207
00:19:12,870 --> 00:19:14,470
Of course.

208
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:23,880
I'm Go Gi Bong.

209
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:28,620
Somehow, you did seem familiar. We briefly met last year, right?

210
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:32,140
Yes, we did. When I saw you before, I was wondering where I met you.

211
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:34,890
I thought I had met you as a defendant.

212
00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:39,380
The ahjumma at the convenience store. Do you have dementia? You're too young for that.

213
00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:45,590
It's a matter of time before someone changes.

214
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:58,680
A personality can change, but this fingerprint never changes.

215
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:02,540
 19.33% 

216
00:20:06,490 --> 00:20:08,540
 47.66% 

217
00:20:19,890 --> 00:20:23,380
Hey, you said you're an expert con artist. What did you do that Inspector Go is...

218
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:24,660
What about Section Chief Go?

219
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:26,770
A hoobae that I know from the fingerprint identification office gave me a call.

220
00:20:26,770 --> 00:20:29,750
- He said that Section Chief Go came for checking fingerprint!
 - Fingerprint?

221
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:34,440
The cup that you drank the tea from earlier! Ah, what should we do?

222
00:20:35,090 --> 00:20:38,180
I was short-sighted.

223
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:21,900
  Baek Joon Soo  

224
00:21:31,470 --> 00:21:35,190
  Prosecutor Oh Ha Ra  

225
00:21:47,370 --> 00:21:49,730
I have something to tell you.

226
00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:55,980
Prosecutor Baek, you have changed so much since I met you.

227
00:21:55,980 --> 00:22:01,900
My gut instinct as a detective reacted wondering if you were someone else.

228
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:06,780
So, I got your fingerprints and went to the forensics lab.

229
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:07,750
Even though—

230
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:11,370
How did the results come out?

231
00:22:11,370 --> 00:22:12,810
That...

232
00:22:16,490 --> 00:22:19,430
Baek Joon Soo's fingerprint

233
00:22:22,430 --> 00:22:24,820
  99.99% 

234
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:28,550
is 99.99% identical.

235
00:22:28,550 --> 00:22:30,420
I am sorry.

236
00:22:39,230 --> 00:22:44,060
Why are you packing your things? Cleaning?

237
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:45,580
Yes.

238
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:48,210
You should just ask the detectives to do it.

239
00:23:11,010 --> 00:23:12,530
I thought my heart was going to explode.

240
00:23:12,530 --> 00:23:15,420
I said to calm your heart.

241
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:20,050
Anyway, be thankful because I saved you too, Prosecutor Oh.

242
00:23:20,050 --> 00:23:22,290
How did you do it?

243
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:49,840
 You should also have some. 

244
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:58,240
 I ate some chips so I will go wash my hands. 

245
00:24:14,190 --> 00:24:17,110
That is really really amazing.

246
00:24:17,110 --> 00:24:19,220
That's nothing.

247
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:21,190
Should I buy you food?

248
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:26,390
How did you know that Section Chief Go would be suspicious?

249
00:24:26,390 --> 00:24:29,830
How did you know that he would get your fingerprint when giving the green tea?

250
00:24:29,830 --> 00:24:33,660
Now that I see, when did you start committing fraud?

251
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:35,150
Were you just originally talented in those things?

252
00:24:35,150 --> 00:24:38,290
Where is your hometown? What about your parents? Do you have any siblings?

253
00:24:38,290 --> 00:24:41,970
How many cons have you committed?

254
00:24:41,970 --> 00:24:45,490
What can you do to not get caught?

255
00:24:45,490 --> 00:24:49,290
I might get indigestion. One at a time.

256
00:24:51,890 --> 00:24:55,520
What is the secret behind being such a great conman?

257
00:25:10,690 --> 00:25:14,650
Should I say that it's the strength of early education?

258
00:25:14,650 --> 00:25:16,560
Early education?

259
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:23,170
You worked hard. Eat a lot.

260
00:25:29,430 --> 00:25:32,220
I am on my way to buy groceries. When I come back I will call you.

261
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:34,260
Okay I got it.

262
00:25:52,630 --> 00:25:55,420
Pop!

263
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:57,220
Ah, that scared me.

264
00:25:57,220 --> 00:26:00,150
Ahjusshi, I got so scared.

265
00:26:00,150 --> 00:26:04,620
That is so tacky. Is that even good?

266
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:08,870
Oh pretty unni. Eat some of this.

267
00:26:08,870 --> 00:26:10,990
Thank you.

268
00:26:14,790 --> 00:26:16,250
It tastes better than I thought.

269
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:18,690
You ate it.

270
00:26:18,690 --> 00:26:20,030
Here buy it. Four won (about $4).

271
00:26:20,030 --> 00:26:23,260
You are trying every method to sell puffed rice.

272
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:25,640
My daughter is a prosecutor.

273
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:27,890
I was going to cut the price. But if you don't want me to, then okay.

274
00:26:27,890 --> 00:26:29,260
Okay, let's just give this up.

275
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:33,580
But unni, has anyone told you that you look like a movie actress?

276
00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:37,600
Movie actress? Who?

277
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:41,080
Audrey Hepburn.

278
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:44,200
Your eyelashes are just like Audrey Hepburn.

279
00:26:47,490 --> 00:26:51,210
How much will be left from selling rice crackers?

280
00:26:54,550 --> 00:26:57,260
You don't need to give me discount.

281
00:26:57,260 --> 00:27:00,280
Since you said it was 4 won earlier.

282
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:02,050
Here is 6 won.

283
00:27:02,050 --> 00:27:05,300
Here 1 won for service. ( complimentary )

284
00:27:06,110 --> 00:27:07,780
Thank you.

285
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:16,230
Nice shot.

286
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:26,140
What did you say the prosecutor's name was?

287
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:29,700
Are you talking about Prosecutor Baek Joon Soo?

288
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:35,390
Does he has a strong lifeline or are you the one who's not doing a good job?

289
00:27:36,530 --> 00:27:39,990
I'm asking if it makes sense that he survived twice?

290
00:27:39,990 --> 00:27:41,930
I apologize.

291
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:44,850
Do it right.

292
00:27:44,850 --> 00:27:48,600
But you know, the chief prosecutor's attitude has been changed.

293
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:52,860
They said not to kill him.

294
00:28:01,990 --> 00:28:04,800
He's saying he doesn't want to get dirty.

295
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:09,930
It's human nature to be calculative from the outside.

296
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:15,490
Bring him to the spa next time. In the hot tub,

297
00:28:15,490 --> 00:28:17,520
let's dunk him in that.

298
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,450
I understand.

299
00:29:18,330 --> 00:29:21,420
They say a bear is the one with the tricks, yet Mr. Wong is the one who takes all the money.

300
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:26,800
All the money that goes into Governor Choi's pocket. That's all the money we give him by running our business.

301
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:30,910
Even if we cut ties with the governor, there's no problem with us eating and surviving.

302
00:29:31,590 --> 00:29:33,310
I don't understand you, CEO.

303
00:29:33,310 --> 00:29:36,040
Eating and living will be solved.

304
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:37,970
Just looking at all the assets you currently have, CEO.

305
00:29:37,970 --> 00:29:41,380
You have no problems with eating and living well for your lifetime.

306
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:50,090
If you have 10 billion won, you can eat and live well.

307
00:29:50,090 --> 00:29:54,380
If it's 100 billion won, you can move a person.

308
00:29:54,380 --> 00:30:02,080
But if you want to move the world, you need 10 or 100 times that.

309
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:18,300
