1
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:26,180
How on earth did  you do it?

2
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:30,180
While I was in Gangwondo, I bought some cabbages from the mountains.

3
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:33,760
What? Are you going to seize some cabbage?

4
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:40,190
Geum Tae Woong.  How did he pull this off?

5
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:55,050
These fools. You should have seen their faces.

6
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:59,090
They have to realize that I'm always on top of their heads.

7
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:05,200
Seong Do, don't let others take advantage of you.

8
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:09,610
I'm saying be someone who deceives, not someone who is deceived.

9
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:13,950
I brought this from Director Song from the casino.

10
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:15,650
Director Song?

11
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:20,450
You can leave. Good work today.

12
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:31,780
 Timing and

13
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,250
 10 billion won 

14
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,730
Two-hundred billion won.

15
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:11,950
I worked like a dog under Governor Choi and saved this up.

16
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:15,060
My babies.

17
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:26,340
Geum Tae Woong pretended to be transporting cash and fooled us.

18
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:30,270
It wasn't entirely unproductive. It would've been one of the two anyway.

19
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:33,030
Either cash or bearer bonds.

20
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:37,310
- So, it's made clear that he's got bearer bonds. 
 - Yeah.

21
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:43,250
But the problem is, we can't find the bonds with only a search and seizure warrant.

22
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,380
We have to make them come out.

23
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,860
How?

24
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:52,400
What do we need at a time like this?

25
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,570
Team spirit between a prosecutor and a con artist.

26
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,820
Prosecutor Oh, let's catch Geum Tae Woong for real.

27
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:09,530
 Switch 

28
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:13,080
  Change the world 

29
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:17,530
Baek Joon Soo and Oh Ha Ra have come by again.

30
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:21,230
Please control your hoobae prosecutors well.

31
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:27,000
If something happens to me, you'll be the one in danger first.

32
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,510
 The one-billion won I gave you. 

33
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:33,440
Do you think I would've given it to you without any evidence?

34
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:41,040
 Satisfied people and righteous prosecutor 

35
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:47,360
Hey, Jin Gyeong Hui!

36
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:50,400
What, Jin Gyeong Hui?

37
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,800
I treated you as my superior all this time, but I can't restrain myself any longer.

38
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:57,830
Let's talk as law training school colleagues and open up.

39
00:03:57,830 --> 00:04:00,100
Did Geum Tae Woong get a hold of your weakness?

40
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:02,370
Did you take his bribe?

41
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:06,680
I will find proof that he isn't Prosecutor Baek Joon Soo!

42
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:11,370
As you please. I'll get Geum Tae Woong and put him away.

43
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:19,040
Geum Tae Woong currently has the bearer bonds.

44
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:24,480
We'll make him bring out the bearer bonds that he put away so securely.

45
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,260
How?

46
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:29,410
Eun Ji, report Feel Galley to the Financial Supervisory Service.

47
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:33,680
First, let's throw a bomb at Geum Tae Woong's main stage.

48
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:38,910
In Tae, spread a rumor online. Say the Special Investigations Team is looking into K-Savings Bank.

49
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:41,970
- We have to shake up Namsan Club first. 
 - Okay.

50
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:47,680
- Director Bong, Financial Supervisory Service—
- You want me to spread the rumor that Financial Supervisory Service is checking on Feel Gallery.

51
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,180
Bingo.

52
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:53,040
If he can't take care of the bonds in the country, he'll look for another solution.

53
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,590
That's right.

54
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:56,300
What's the method to get the resolution we want?

55
00:04:56,300 --> 00:05:01,560
Worst case scenario, if he has to leave Korea.

56
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:05,240
He'll try to exchange them for something he can take with him.

57
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:10,250
Tell them to come in.

58
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:22,350
- What is it?
 - I am from the insurance crime investigation team.

59
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:23,870
What?

60
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:27,150
According to IFAS's investigation, 
(IFAS: Insurance Fraud Artificial Intelligence System)

61
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:30,910
during the Central and South America Exhibition, for the broken Moai statutes,

62
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:34,620
you were wrongfully paid a huge amount of insurance money.

63
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:38,990
I got it. If you tell me to pay the penalty, I will.

64
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:44,470
  Closed Indefinitely  

65
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:50,410
 Seoul Central District Prosecutor's Office started an internal audit for the K-Savings Bank.  

66
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:59,640
I heard the Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office's Special Investigations team is looking into our bank.

67
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:03,950
Let's sue to void the contract to turn over our shares.

68
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:07,870
At times like this, we have to find ways for us to survive individually.

69
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:13,550
An agenda to dismiss me from the executive director position?

70
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:15,770
Seong Joo Pil, what are you saying?

71
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:20,360
The Prosecutors' Office is conducting an audit to review whether we conform to the investor integrity act.

72
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,910
Integrity?

73
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:23,300
Yes.

74
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:27,510
You'll have to step down from the executive director position.

75
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:36,670
As for your rudeness, I'll repay you after I take care of the urgent business.

76
00:06:55,910 --> 00:06:58,370
Who are you?

77
00:06:58,370 --> 00:06:59,890
The camera!

78
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:12,280
Yes, this is Go Gi Bong. What?

79
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:20,110
Director Kim is in a coma.

80
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:25,700
CEO, Director Kim is unconscious.

81
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:31,910
I thought it would become very cumbersome if Director Kim started talking.

82
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,960
So, I made him shut up in advance.

83
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:50,300
I don't know if you heard the rumor, but I'm in a bind.

84
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:55,040
I'd like to convert these bonds all at once.

85
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:59,900
You're considering leaving the country just in case, right?

86
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:06,110
It was sold for 90 billion dollars at the Sotherby's in 2007.

87
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:09,490
It had since disappeared and on the black market in France,

88
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:13,310
it's a 60-carat diamond that was sold for 150 billion won.

89
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:16,350
It's called White Star.

90
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:19,600
Can you get it?

91
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:28,390
A lady came from the Chentai Group.

92
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:30,520
Tell her to come in.

93
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:44,920
 Nice to meet you. I'm the chief secretary of the Chentai Group, Grace Chong. 

94
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:50,230
I'm Geum Tae Woong. Please take a seat.

95
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:54,880
Then shall we start with the authentication first?

96
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:10,970
Director Bong will make a special briefcase.

97
00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:12,330
A special briefcase?

98
00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:15,560
Of course, we need a counterfeit diamond which will look identical to the original.

99
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:19,620
This bag has two layers.

100
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:25,000
We place the fake White Star here.

101
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:29,060
Close it.

102
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:40,750
And here we will have the real White Star.

103
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:49,450
Then, Geum Tae Woong will end up having the counterfeit.

104
00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:52,130
Practice.

105
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:24,170
Amazing. It's flawless grade.

106
00:10:24,170 --> 00:10:25,940
As for its inclusion or blemishes,

107
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:27,860
It's also flawless. It's perfect.

108
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:31,340
It's the authentic diamond that came from Sotherby's auction house.

109
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:38,450
Very well.

110
00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:40,040
You said 160 billion won, right?

111
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:44,210
 Hold on. The chairman contacted me and changed his mind. 

112
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:47,290
 He said 200 billion won. 

113
00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:48,580
She says 200 billion won.

114
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:50,470
What are you saying all of a sudden?

115
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:53,650
 The international market price for jewels changes every day.  

116
00:10:53,650 --> 00:10:56,520
She says the international market price for jewels changes every day.

117
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:00,510
1.8 billion dollars.

118
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:02,500
1.8 billion dollars.

119
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,470
Fine.

120
00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:20,730
I will pay the full 2 billion dollars.

121
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:25,240
Fine. We will pay the full 2 billion dollars.

122
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:40,010
 The one with the black dot is the real White Star. 

123
00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:50,380
The person who came with you

124
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:55,490
seems quite nervous. He is sweating as well.

125
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:58,960
He's a foreigner. The climate must not suit him.

126
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:03,120
They came from Hong Kong. You're saying it's hot here?

127
00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:10,920
Please take my handkerchief–

128
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:13,530
Attorney Park, be careful.

129
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,970
Here is the certification.

130
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:40,000
Diamond Grading Report

131
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,840
Good.

132
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:39,650
It's pretty.

133
00:13:39,650 --> 00:13:42,390
I thought I would die of a heart attack.

134
00:13:42,390 --> 00:13:45,510
Because of that guard hyung's mistake.

135
00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:47,560
But you did well!

136
00:13:48,770 --> 00:13:52,600
Now, Geum Tae Woong lost everything.

137
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:55,480
Right.

138
00:13:56,190 --> 00:13:58,640
What are we going to do about the diamond?

139
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:01,660
I will wear this for a couple of days...

140
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:04,460
- Wouldn't do, right?
 - Why not?

141
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:09,200
Do it if you want to break your neck. Let go.

142
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:14,250
This is not a jewel

143
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:17,000
but Geum Tae Woong's dirty asset.

144
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,690
Correct.

145
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:21,650
- You take care of it, Hyung.
 - Huh?

146
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:25,800
You should return it to its rightful owner.

147
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:28,310
My kid wouldn't have done such a thing.

148
00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:32,020
You should know better for investigating! Say something.

149
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:35,280
Please sit down.

150
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,870
What brings you here?

151
00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:46,530
It was so cold last night that I couldn't sleep and I was walking around.

152
00:14:46,530 --> 00:14:49,670
I found this in the park.

153
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:51,760
This is a diamond I found.

154
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,270
What are you saying?

155
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:55,340
This is a diamond.

156
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:57,580
And of the highest quality.

157
00:14:57,580 --> 00:15:02,500
This is called the White Star and is valued at 2 billion dollars.

158
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:05,860
 Today, a homeless man had acquired a diamond in a park. 

159
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:08,610
 He's grabbing attention because he reported it to a police station. 

160
00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:11,850
 According to an expert's appraisal, at auction this diamond 

161
00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:16,610
 was revealed to be nicknamed the White Star, which had sold for 200 billion won. 

162
00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:18,490
White Sta–

163
00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:35,270
 "White Star," diamond worth 200 billion won 

164
00:15:59,130 --> 00:16:04,270
This is an imitation. This is fake.

165
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:06,820
Fake?

166
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:10,770
Are you certain?

167
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:12,880
Yes, it is completely fake.

168
00:16:17,190 --> 00:16:22,010
Who dared to fool me?

169
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:28,540
My entire assets. My all...

170
00:16:36,770 --> 00:16:39,470
Sa Do Chan!

171
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:47,950
Cheers!

172
00:16:47,950 --> 00:16:49,420
Nice!

173
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:53,650
In the end, our master of trickery managed to take away Geum Tae Woong's entire assets.

174
00:16:53,650 --> 00:16:55,100
We're back.

175
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:56,750
Did you see the news since then?

176
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:59,200
I heard someone lost a diamond worth 200 billion won.

177
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:02,600
But I heard the diamond owner hasn't come forward.

178
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:06,710
I wonder who that diamond owner is. I'm so curious.

179
00:17:06,710 --> 00:17:10,920
He must be so frustrated. Not being able to say it's his even though it is.

180
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:15,060
Well? He can't say it's his if he bought it with dirty money.

181
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:17,400
Then, whose is that diamond?

182
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:21,980
Well? I guess it will be returned to the national treasury if no one claims it.

183
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:25,280
I see. Returned...

184
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:33,170
- Are they the ones? 
 - Yes, they're

185
00:17:33,170 --> 00:17:36,100
the ones who assaulted the victim under order at the Incheon port storage.

186
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:40,570
They were hiding all this time in Mokpo. So, it was tough to find them.

187
00:17:40,570 --> 00:17:42,970
So, you received money from Kim Hyeong Wook and

188
00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:45,760
assaulted people at the Incheon port storage. Is that right?

189
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,080
Yes.

190
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:48,570
Did you commit murder as well?

191
00:17:48,570 --> 00:17:51,940
No. We didn't!

192
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:58,820
Then, did you see him commit murder?

193
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:03,480
Yes. He hit a person with a metal rod and choked him.

194
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:05,960
He killed him!

195
00:18:09,470 --> 00:18:10,820
Issue a warrant right away.

196
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:13,070
Okay.

197
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,670
Where is Attorney Park Hyeok?

198
00:18:25,670 --> 00:18:28,790
That's me. Why?

199
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:37,270
These bastards fooled me till the end!

200
00:18:49,410 --> 00:18:50,820
 Arrest Warrant 

201
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:57,400
Geum Tae Woong, you're under arrest for the murder of Sa Ma Cheon!

202
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:03,990
Director Kim who's in jail,

203
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:08,700
you put him in a coma and you were relieved, right?

204
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:10,440
But what to do?

205
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:15,150
There's another witness who saw you kill Sa Ma Cheon.

206
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:26,140
Sa Do Chan, couldn't you be satisfied with taking away the diamond worth 200 billion won from me by fraud?

207
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:30,320
Still, you can't catch me! Why?

208
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:33,220
This is an investigation conducted by a con artist!

209
00:19:42,210 --> 00:19:45,850
Prosecutor Baek Joon Soo. Or should I say Sa Do Chan?

210
00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:48,030
It appears that you must go to the inspection department.

211
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:51,650
Yo, fake one. The game's over.

212
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:57,280
Chief Prosecutor! What are you doing right now?

213
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:01,050
Why are you calling Prosecutor Baek Joon Soo a swindler? On what basis?!

214
00:20:01,050 --> 00:20:04,080
Am I the kind of person who would barge in without any evidence?

215
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:11,250
Bangbaedong mother and daughter murder case that Prosecutor Baek was on three years ago.

216
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:14,180
Prosecutor Baek had been dispatched to the crime scene.

217
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:18,430
But he was attacked by the suspect and he bled at the scene.

218
00:20:18,430 --> 00:20:22,290
And in order to determine the blood between the suspect and him...

219
00:20:22,290 --> 00:20:26,470
Prosecutor Baek Joon Soo's blood was also tested for DNA.

220
00:20:28,610 --> 00:20:32,320
Hey, Fake. We don't need a scar on your shoulder anymore.

221
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,580
That can be fabricated.

222
00:20:37,310 --> 00:20:40,540
Blood. Let's give blood.

223
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:44,160
Even if you're an amazing con artist

224
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,710
you can't fabricate your blood.

225
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:52,390
We have a doctor waiting at the Inspections Headquarters office.

226
00:20:53,050 --> 00:20:55,150
We'll compare it with the data from three years ago.

227
00:20:55,150 --> 00:20:58,670
If it matches that, I'll accept it.

228
00:20:58,670 --> 00:21:02,970
Hey, fake one. Getting nervous? Going crazy?

229
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:07,330
How dare you act as a prosecutor?

230
00:21:07,330 --> 00:21:11,180
We are in the middle of an interrogation. Please leave.

231
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:20,470
Fine. I'll take the blood test.

232
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:25,670
Oh, yes!

233
00:21:25,670 --> 00:21:29,590
If it's revealed that you're fake,

234
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:33,490
you know that this investigation is annulled, right?

235
00:21:35,930 --> 00:21:36,620
Excuse us.

236
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:41,000
Not at all. It's an interesting spectacle so please don't mind me.

237
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,880
All right. Go and come back as you please.

238
00:21:45,530 --> 00:21:49,720
Please be sure to let me know the result as well.

239
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:58,510
If Prosecutor Baek Joon Soo doesn't come back to face me,

240
00:21:58,510 --> 00:22:01,910
I guess it would mean you're fake.

241
00:22:33,150 --> 00:22:35,310
Press down, please.

242
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:39,470
Let's go to the interrogation room in the Inspection Headquarters office.

243
00:22:42,510 --> 00:22:47,130
Chief Prosecutor, are you going to do this to the end?

244
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:50,340
Chief Prosecutor!

245
00:23:08,770 --> 00:23:11,720
 Analysis of blood sample 

246
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:18,880
 Details of test result 

247
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:31,480
I'm sorry, Deputy Prosecutor.

248
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:34,790
I made another mistake.

249
00:23:34,790 --> 00:23:36,310
With the blood sample from three years ago,

250
00:23:36,310 --> 00:23:37,860
 The blood sample is a 99.99% match. 

251
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:40,480
it's a perfect match.

252
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:45,010
He really is Prosecutor Baek Joon Soo.

253
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:50,000
Gil Dae Ro, are you kidding?

254
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:56,560
Chief Prosecutor, we'll get going now.

255
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:58,090
Let's go.

256
00:24:00,870 --> 00:24:02,710
 Something is weird about the Inspection Headquarters. 

257
00:24:02,710 --> 00:24:06,580
  It seems like she found out that I am Sa Do Chan. 

258
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:08,070
  I will go. 

259
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:11,270
 But you are still recovering from the operation. 

260
00:24:11,270 --> 00:24:16,140
 Even if I collapse on my way, I'll go. 

261
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:19,330
 Prosecutor Oh Ha Ra 

262
00:24:19,330 --> 00:24:22,200
Geum Tae Woong is ready for interrogation.

263
00:24:23,910 --> 00:24:25,600
Hold on.

264
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:29,640
 Ready for Switch 

265
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:33,020
Go ahead. I will follow you after checking one more document.

266
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:34,540
Alright.

267
00:25:03,570 --> 00:25:05,470
Prosecutor Baek.

268
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:14,110
 Prosecutor Baek Joon Soo 

269
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:24,100
It's a relief to see you looking so healthy, Sunbae Baek.

270
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:35,340
I'll turn this game around completely.

271
00:25:40,410 --> 00:25:45,370
Why are you coming in alone, Prosecutor Oh? Where's Prosecutor Baek who went out with you?

272
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:57,360
What did I tell you? It's the end for you too, Prosecutor Oh

273
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:00,670
because you played around with a con artist.

274
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:05,480
- Let's leave, Lawyer Kim. 
- Okay.

275
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:14,440
What's this? Why are you coming back, Con Artist?

276
00:26:17,570 --> 00:26:19,860
The blood test result of Prosecutor Baek Joon Soo,

277
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:23,980
the report says that says it matches 99.99%.

278
00:26:26,610 --> 00:26:30,270
Can a con artist fake his own blood?

279
00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:35,400
 The blood sample is a 99.99% match. 

280
00:26:39,190 --> 00:26:42,150
This doesn't make sense.

281
00:26:42,150 --> 00:26:47,050
You must be Sa Do Chan. You have to be Sa Do Chan, so that

282
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:51,600
this entire investigation will be annulled.

283
00:26:58,350 --> 00:27:01,190
Let's resume questioning.

284
00:27:01,190 --> 00:27:06,810
Geum Tae Woong, do you admit to the murder of Sa Ma Cheon?

285
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:13,250
 Establish law and rule: Detention Center 

286
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:30,240
Seong Doo.

287
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,180
Yes, CEO.

288
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:37,810
I... I...

289
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:44,530
I am your father.

290
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:51,610
Judging by your look, you already knew.

291
00:27:51,610 --> 00:27:55,740
Yes. You'd probably want to kill me

292
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:59,120
since I abandoned both you and your mother.

293
00:28:00,010 --> 00:28:05,810
But that was all because I had my own circumstances.

294
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:14,070
Seong Do. You were sad all this time because I scolded you so much, huh?

295
00:28:14,070 --> 00:28:17,390
That's all because I wanted to make you into a capable person.

296
00:28:17,390 --> 00:28:22,700
And I wanted to leave you the world I live in because you're my son.

297
00:28:24,850 --> 00:28:29,470
As your father, let me ask you a favor once and for all.

298
00:28:30,870 --> 00:28:34,600
There will be a trial soon.

299
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:40,330
Would you be able to stand as a witness for me then?

300
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:49,740
You know the text message that you exchanged with Director Kim?

301
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:50,610
Yes.

302
00:28:50,610 --> 00:28:53,100
Submit it as evidence.

303
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:59,930
Say Director Kim was in charge of smuggling drugs and murder and that he ordered you to do that.

304
00:29:01,870 --> 00:29:04,540
I didn't tell him to, you know.

305
00:29:05,670 --> 00:29:09,600
Director Kim. What would a man in coma know?

306
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:13,440
If you testify  properly, I'll be able to get out soon.

307
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:19,940
Once I get out of here, I'll do everything for you as a father.

308
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:22,790
I'll leave my assets to you.

309
00:29:22,790 --> 00:29:30,620
Seong Do, you're my one and only hope.

310
00:29:33,930 --> 00:29:36,340
Why aren't you answering?

311
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:44,230
- I understand perfectly.
 - Right.

312
00:29:55,810 --> 00:29:58,440
I think my job is over now.

313
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:02,680
The prosecutors will take care of the trial with no problem.

314
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:12,850
Sa Do Chan. Someone who desperately cheers me on.

315
00:30:12,850 --> 00:30:19,640
If I had someone like that, even one person, I'd be grateful.

316
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:27,020
Sa Do Chan, I thank you.

317
00:30:27,910 --> 00:30:31,810
I didn't do it to hear you say thanks.

318
00:30:31,810 --> 00:30:36,260
But you know, I got to play a prosecutor to my heart's content thanks to you.

319
00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:38,750
Let's thank each other then.

320
00:30:43,850 --> 00:30:49,360
By the way, I have something to give you.

321
00:30:51,270 --> 00:30:55,010
Today is the first trial day for CEO Geum Tae Woong of Feel Gallery.

322
00:30:55,010 --> 00:30:59,840
He is charged with many crimes including murder, instigation of murders, violation of special crimes.

323
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:03,110
He is known to have a very luxurious counsel team, especially for this trial.

324
00:31:03,110 --> 00:31:07,800
Everyone is paying attention to him to see how well he'll be able to defend himself against the prosecution's charges.

325
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:10,940
I'm Oh So Ra from the SBC News.

326
00:31:28,430 --> 00:31:32,300
The prosecutor gown suits you well.

327
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:40,780
My heart is beating. Like the first time I wore this gown.

328
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:45,410
It's good to hear you say that, Sunbae.

329
00:31:45,410 --> 00:31:49,950
They say a con artist's heart should beat slowly. But the heart of a prosecutor

330
00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:52,820
should beat with passion, right?

331
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:56,670
Yeah. It has to beat passionately

332
00:31:56,670 --> 00:31:59,180
but with a sense of duty.

333
00:32:00,370 --> 00:32:07,200
I want to prove it to those bastards in court, that justice never loses.

334
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:10,640
And not to Sa Do Chan?

335
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:14,640
Of course, I have to show him as well.

336
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:18,440
I made him suffer so much by dragging him into this.

337
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:24,070
Great. You'll be able to do a good job in court according to our strategy, right?

338
00:32:24,070 --> 00:32:25,650
Yeah.

339
00:32:25,650 --> 00:32:32,000
