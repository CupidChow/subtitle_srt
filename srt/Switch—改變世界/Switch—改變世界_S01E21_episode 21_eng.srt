1
00:00:52,692 --> 00:00:53,702
Sunbae.

2
00:00:53,702 --> 00:00:58,592
Prosecutor Oh, you planned this knowing how dangerous this is?

3
00:00:58,592 --> 00:01:01,162
How were you planning to wrap it up?

4
00:01:02,332 --> 00:01:04,138
How did you know about this place?

5
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:10,270
I called Prosecutor Baek.

6
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:25,380
You scammers!

7
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:43,540
I thought you had sold your soul to the devil. I was so anxious.

8
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:49,070
When I first saw the news that Sa Do Chan received the bribe, I thought, "Oh, darn."

9
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:54,130
I thought, "He finally fell into Geum Tae Woong's trap."

10
00:01:55,820 --> 00:02:01,910
I didn't have any other choice in order to turn the game around and to deceive Geum Tae Woong.

11
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,460
I'm sorry I couldn't tell you in advance.

12
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:14,720
Thanks.

13
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:19,340
For not changing. Thanks.

14
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,920
Sunbae!

15
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:33,280
Sunbae! Are you okay?

16
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:44,790
What's with the wiretap?

17
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:46,460
The CCTV was turned off.

18
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:50,070
Director Kim, how are you taking care of things

19
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:53,100
while the con artist comes and goes as if he owns this place!

20
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:55,100
I'm sorry.

21
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:06,360
If Prosecutor Baek planned this out with that scammer to mock me...

22
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:11,690
Call Baek Joon Soo right away.

23
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:14,100
All right.

24
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:16,640
Last time, when he was in that car accident,

25
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:20,750
Calcification occurred in his heart valve and there was stenosis.

26
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:24,110
I did replace it with an artificial valve.

27
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:29,760
For the time being, you can't let him overexert himself. He must get rest.

28
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:36,160
Geum Tae Woong. I'll make sure you stand trial.

29
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:43,070
 Geum Tae Woong 

30
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:48,490
Geum Tae Woong is calling.

31
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,420
Yes, CEO. What is it?

32
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:02,400
I have something to talk about. Let's meet right away.

33
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,570
Right now?

34
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:10,190
Well, I'm not feeling well today.

35
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:16,220
Oh, really? Then, should I come by and see you?

36
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:26,110
No. I can't have you over at such a humble place.

37
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:28,360
I'll come.

38
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:54,620
He's waiting for you.

39
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:11,370
I'm sorry for running late. I'm not feeling well.

40
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:17,930
I feel bad for calling out someone who's not feeling well.  Have a seat for now.

41
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:45,840
You promised that you'd be my knight in my game. I guess I believed you too easily.

42
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,870
What did you do while the king was taken away?

43
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:53,630
Not only were you unable to be my reinforcement, but you made things even worse.

44
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:58,500
I'm sorry. I didn't know that Prosecutor Oh Ha Ra would know about the murder.

45
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02,650
You didn't know?

46
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:12,840
Then, do you know about this?

47
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:21,860
The very first day you came to see me... You said you'd sell out Sa Do Chan and told me where he lives.

48
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:26,930
But Sa Do Chan had already placed a bug like this.

49
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:33,420
So, I tried to solve the mystery.

50
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:39,130
That Prosecutor Baek was in cahoots with Sa Do Chan from the get-go and you were acting in front of   me.

51
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:49,590
If that's the case, our contract never came to be valid in the first place.

52
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:53,380
I'm going to have to destroy the knight in my game of Janggi.

53
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,310
I've been bugged as well.

54
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:19,500
After I found out about this, I knew I had made a mistake.

55
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:23,480
CEO. You have a more than enough reasons to misunderstand about me.

56
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:31,540
Sa Do Chan played both of us in the palm of his hand?

57
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:35,650
The Faberge egg and the Terracotta Warriors that were discovered at the Chief Prosecutors' home,

58
00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:38,600
I'm sure they were all Sa Do Chan's doing.

59
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:44,280
I'm sorry that I couldn't stop him first, but I'll be sure to catch Sa Do Chan.

60
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:54,290
Forget your apology. I'll give you a mission.

61
00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:01,160
Governor Choi Jeong Pil. Pull the plug on that old man.

62
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:05,490
Are you asking me to conduct a targeted investigation?

63
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:10,160
I conducted numerous targeted investigations by making up an item while I was a detective.

64
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,060
It's not that hard. 
 ( Item: A planned investigation by the police targeting a specific person or goal )

65
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:17,180
In order to indict Governo Choi, we must've detected an illegal act to conduct an approved investigation.

66
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:19,540
Or there has to be a criminal charge against him.

67
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:27,040
I don't know about that, but I'll be watching you to see if you accomplish the mission I gave you.

68
00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:38,640
 Switch 

69
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:41,770
 A bird flies with two wings 

70
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:47,690
How did it go?

71
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:50,280
I got past the crisis for now.

72
00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:57,820
Prosecutor Baek Joon Soo must be at the Prosecutors' Office in order to get Geum Tae Woong.

73
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:04,450
I got to be close to Geum Tae Woong and even got to the Namsan Club.

74
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:12,450
If I disappear again, the flow of the investigation thus far will be interrupted.

75
00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:17,040
Make a switch...

76
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:23,880
I ask you once more, Sa Do Chan.

77
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:39,810
 Government ID 
 Baek Joon Soo 
 Supreme Prosecutors' Office 

78
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:56,130
Starting now, Sa Do Chan, you're the real Baek Joon Soo.

79
00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:04,950
 Government ID 
 Baek Joon Soo 
 Supreme Prosecutors' Office 

80
00:10:27,090 --> 00:10:28,920
What?

81
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:33,500
Do you feel somewhat different now that you're back to work after some time?

82
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:44,240
- Your tie... eyeglasses... your hair is... 
 - Okay.

83
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,260
Fine.

84
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:50,550
Aigoo. How did I become a prosecutor?

85
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:54,030
I have no choice but to be a prosecutor.

86
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:55,370
What are you talking about?

87
00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:58,080
I became a prosecutor somehow because of you in the beginning.

88
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:00,320
Well, that's because you were trying to get the diamond.

89
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:05,820
But this time, I have no choice but to be a prosecutor because of Prosecutor Baek.

90
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:09,750
Sa Do Chan, maybe you were originally meant to become a prosecutor.

91
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:12,000
However it may be or whether you had a choice or not.

92
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:19,440
Originally, I  had nothing but a very small dream of living quietly being a scammer.

93
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:23,050
We have to keep this a secret from Deputy Prosecutor Yang.

94
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:25,330
Why? We're all on the same team.

95
00:11:25,330 --> 00:11:27,570
Deputy Prosecutor...

96
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:32,340
Let's keep him out of it this time.

97
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:33,900
Let's go, Sunbaenim.

98
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:35,990
All right.

99
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:42,290
Oh, Mi Ran!

100
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:45,120
Good morning.

101
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,400
Yes, Prosecutor!

102
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:54,720
Prosecutor is back. For real!

103
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,990
Long time no see!

104
00:11:56,990 --> 00:12:00,580
Prosecutor, we saw you yesterday. What do you mean, long time no see?

105
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:05,540
Even if it's for one night, it seems like a long time if you miss people.

106
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:08,010
Shall we go for a drink after work?

107
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:14,370
You've been so cold toward me for the last few days. I was so sad about it.

108
00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:16,380
But I'm glad now.

109
00:12:17,310 --> 00:12:19,970
Sunbae, you're talkative once again.

110
00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:22,700
People change all the time.

111
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:26,480
But you two must be on friendly terms again.

112
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:29,590
Your eyes didn't meet even up to yesterday.

113
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:32,590
There was a misunderstanding, but it's been cleared up.

114
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:36,390
We'll continue to work on confidential assignments like we did before. Please be good to us.

115
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:40,950
You know, the relationship between a man and woman tends to flip flop.

116
00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:44,300
I've become more affectionate with my husband as we argue.

117
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:48,090
We're not that close to be flip flopping.

118
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:51,940
Sunbae, let's get to work.

119
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:54,450
Everyone, let's work.

120
00:12:54,450 --> 00:12:57,210
Let's do that.

121
00:12:57,210 --> 00:12:59,200
Prosecutor Oh, you have no ambition.

122
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:03,060
How can a prosecutor take down another prosecutor? The chief prosecutor, no less.

123
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:05,410
How can you become successful like that?

124
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:08,520
Well? She is a fool who doesn't have any backing.

125
00:13:11,810 --> 00:13:14,720
The one who got rid of Prosecutor Jeong Do Yeong. It's that female prosecutor, right?

126
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,710
Did she want to become famous that badly?

127
00:13:16,710 --> 00:13:18,370
The kids these days are too much.

128
00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:21,580
Aren't you trying too hard to become successful?

129
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:24,760
What's happened to the hierarchy of the prosecutors' office these days?

130
00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:28,530
Don't you know about team spirit (live and die together mentality) of all prosecutors?

131
00:13:28,530 --> 00:13:30,010
Let's not do this.

132
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:35,050
"Team spirit of all prosecutors" became a phrase to describe indiscreet collusion by the prosecutors' office.

133
00:13:35,050 --> 00:13:37,090
Didn't you know?

134
00:13:50,990 --> 00:13:53,210
Everyone, sit down.

135
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:01,000
Unfortunately, due to a recent incident

136
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,420
the people's trust in the prosecutors' office has fallen to the ground.

137
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:09,140
Everyone, don't forget your sense of duty and watch how you behave.

138
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:11,180
Yes, ma'am.

139
00:14:14,010 --> 00:14:17,850
Prosecutor and I were busy investigating Chief Prosecutor Jeong Do Yeong.

140
00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:20,600
We carried out our plan without you.

141
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:23,180
I'm sorry for not telling you in advance.

142
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:25,160
I understand.

143
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:28,490
I, too, did approach Geum Tae Woon intentionally.

144
00:14:28,490 --> 00:14:33,150
I had to return to my prosecutor position. And I had to reveal the connection between Geum Tae Woong and Jeong Do Yeong.

145
00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:36,940
In any case, I apologize not telling you in advance, Deputy Prosecutor.

146
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:40,740
No, no. I heard the story from Prosecutor Oh.

147
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:45,030
In any case, everything is back to normal!

148
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:48,700
Baek Joon Soo, thank you.

149
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:53,640
Now, let's get Brown Bear right this time.

150
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:56,420
- Yes. 
 - I got it.

151
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:01,510
Wait... I...

152
00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:04,470
You know how I complimented Sa Do Chan a few days ago with you?

153
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:07,210
It was really my mistake. Forget about that.

154
00:15:07,210 --> 00:15:10,380
Did you say you complimented Sa Do Chan?

155
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:15,300
I had my mind on something else that day. What did you say...

156
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:17,510
Just that he is social and...

157
00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:21,460
He's kind of cute when he pretends not to know things.

158
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:24,610
If he had taken the bar and had become a prosecutor,

159
00:15:24,610 --> 00:15:28,360
I guess he'd have a great record that would be in the top five of the national prosecutors' offices.

160
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:30,750
Prosecutor Baek, don't keep thinking about that.

161
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:34,520
No. I agree with your opinion wholeheartedly.

162
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:38,490
Deputy Prosecutor, I knew you're amazing.

163
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:52,730
I told you to be careful. How can you be so frivolous?

164
00:15:52,730 --> 00:15:56,370
What? Deputy Prosecutor Yang has a great eye for discerning people.

165
00:15:56,370 --> 00:16:01,090
Sociable and cute when I pretend...

166
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:05,460
- There's a Namsan Club meeting tonight, right? 
 - Yeah.

167
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:09,270
Prosecutor Baek set it up nicely. I just have to go and continue.

168
00:16:09,270 --> 00:16:12,420
You got all the information from Sunbae Baek, right?

169
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:19,040
Geum Tae Woong and Namsan Club. Let's put them all in one basket and take care of them at once.

170
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:21,370
Okay!

171
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:37,140
Manager Hong Gi Seo of Industry Bank.

172
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:42,420
Director Joo Gi Hyeok of JK Group.

173
00:16:46,090 --> 00:16:49,600
Namsan Club's member information.

174
00:16:56,150 --> 00:16:58,810
Hello, Prosecutor Baek.

175
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:02,230
Editor-in-chief of Dongbong Daily News, Song Jeong Hyeok.

176
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:04,550
Hello, Editor Song Jeong Hyeok.

177
00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:06,560
Have a seat.

178
00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:10,960
How have you been?

179
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:16,200
Grandson of Boram Foundation Executive Director, Lee Gi Jeong.

180
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,980
Have a seat.

181
00:17:36,370 --> 00:17:42,120
As everyone may know, Former Chief Prosecutor Jeong Do Yeong has been arrested over an unfortunate incident.

182
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:45,040
I didn't expect much from Jeong Do Yeong anyway.

183
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:49,700
He didn't have the determination to become the king. He wasn't made for the job.

184
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:53,680
Then, do you have another horse to replace him with?

185
00:17:58,050 --> 00:18:00,420
What do you think of Prosecutor Baek?

186
00:18:02,810 --> 00:18:06,030
Young politicians are popular in Europe these days.

187
00:18:06,030 --> 00:18:09,680
The French president and Canadian prime minister. They're both in their 40s.

188
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:12,910
If we wait about 10 years, there's no reason he can't be ours.

189
00:18:15,050 --> 00:18:16,870
Let's drink.

190
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:21,840
To Prosecutors Baek's 40s.

191
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:48,740
The K-Savings Bank shares, did you hand them over to CEO Geum?

192
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:52,280
I'm in the process of doing so.

193
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:54,740
K-Savings Bank?

194
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:55,950
Yes.

195
00:18:55,950 --> 00:19:00,270
It was originally Governor Choi's, but CEO Geum took it.

196
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:03,480
CEO Geum's trying to take away all Governor Choi's power while he's at it.

197
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:07,640
I heard our club was created by Governor Choi.

198
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:10,580
But do you think he'll stand back and watch?

199
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:12,000
There's no way.

200
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:17,940
I think he's looking for his way back in with the Gates of Hell or something like that.

201
00:19:20,430 --> 00:19:22,810
 Gates of Hell. 

202
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:27,640
Victor Jang. He's the CEO of Kijeve Corporation in Russia.

203
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:32,870
He was selected as one of the top 100 businessmen in the Forbes magazine in 2017.

204
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:34,370
That's the Gates of Hell?

205
00:19:34,370 --> 00:19:38,740
Our country isn't importing natural gas from Turkistan yet.

206
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:42,440
But if the import route opens up, ten times the invested amount?

207
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:44,940
No, you can guarantee 100 times the return.

208
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:48,240
Oppa. Let's invest, too.

209
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,380
How much do we need?

210
00:19:54,510 --> 00:19:57,700
There's something behind the Gates of Hell.

211
00:19:57,700 --> 00:20:01,910
It could be a jackpot or something planned by a skillful scammer.

212
00:20:05,910 --> 00:20:07,840
The chief prosecutor's attorney is here.

213
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:10,180
Good job. Step outside for a moment.

214
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:11,340
Yes, sir.

215
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:13,310
Have a seat.

216
00:20:18,090 --> 00:20:24,740
I'm looking into various avenues to see how Chief Prosecutor's health is.

217
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:27,470
He should come out soon.

218
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:32,340
My client asked me to tell you this.

219
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:36,850
If you ignore his SOS, he'll ask for help elsewhere.

220
00:20:36,850 --> 00:20:42,340
If that happens, there will be no secrets.

221
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:44,230
I see.

222
00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:46,710
You have to reply soon.

223
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:53,940
I'll send over a gift soon.

224
00:21:12,490 --> 00:21:17,000
Prosecutor, there's big trouble! Former Chief Prosecutor Jeong Do Yeong committed suicide!

225
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:28,510
 Former Chief Prosecutor Jeong Do Yeong who was confined in Hannam jail 

226
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:32,110
 was found dead in the detention center. 

227
00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:36,140
 Since there's no circumstantial evidence of it being a murder, it's assumed to be suicide. 

228
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:41,170
 After the murder of smuggler from six years ago was revealed, Former Chief Prosecutor Jeong Do Yeong  

229
00:21:41,170 --> 00:21:46,880
 is assumed to have committed a suicide, being pressured with the criminal charges of a murder and  disposal of a body.  

230
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,710
Oh, no!

231
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:52,980
How could he...

232
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:54,440
 Did you hear? 
  

233
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:55,590
Chief Prosecutor died.

234
00:21:55,590 --> 00:21:57,240
Who cares if you climb up to the top?

235
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:59,340
He fell from grace and died because he was so greedy.

236
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:01,430
It's no use.

237
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:10,380
 Former Chief Prosecutor Jeong Do Yeong found dead in jail 

238
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:20,110
Good job.

239
00:22:26,610 --> 00:22:32,580
It's too bad, but what can I do? We must get rid of a horse we can't use.

240
00:22:35,650 --> 00:22:37,250
How are things going with the banks?

241
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:41,400
I made all of Governor Choi's people step down and changed all the management staff.

242
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:43,880
You just have to take the office.

243
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:50,160
Sa Do Chan. Did you find him yet?

244
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:52,950
I think he moved his hideout.

245
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:55,640
I'll put out more men.

246
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:57,680
How is Seong Do?

247
00:22:58,650 --> 00:23:02,440
Find him. He contacted those guys.

248
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:05,630
There might be something useful there.

249
00:23:06,410 --> 00:23:08,570
I got it.

250
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:15,240
 Jeong Do Yeong 

251
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:17,200
Today, even Chief Prosecutor Jeong Do Yeong...

252
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:20,970
So-called "Foreign diplomat pouch smuggling case," from the beginning of the investigation until now.

253
00:23:20,970 --> 00:23:24,870
These are people who died who were connected to Brown Bear.

254
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:26,860
The common thread is that they all committed suicide.

255
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:31,140
To be exact, murders disguised as suicide with clear reasons.

256
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:32,410
This is Brown Bear's signature move.

257
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:34,610
I think he knows something about the law.

258
00:23:34,610 --> 00:23:37,570
It's a method to muddy up the investigation from the get-go.

259
00:23:37,570 --> 00:23:40,000
He's bold enough to deceive people.

260
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,230
In the future, too, it's possible that there will be more victims.

261
00:23:43,230 --> 00:23:46,400
This is on the level of a serial murder.

262
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:51,010
If a crazy man is behind the steering wheel, we have to pull him out of the seat even if we beat him up.

263
00:23:51,010 --> 00:23:53,400
That's the way we can prevent future victims.

264
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:54,970
Yes, sir.

265
00:23:56,510 --> 00:23:59,920
 Feel Gallery, Geum Tae Woong, Brown Bear 

266
00:24:16,210 --> 00:24:18,270
Robbery! Hey!

267
00:24:50,410 --> 00:24:53,260
CEO Geum, welcome!

268
00:24:55,790 --> 00:24:57,670
Congratulations.

269
00:25:05,350 --> 00:25:08,820
Thank you. Let's go inside.

270
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:14,420
 Executive Director Geum Tae Woong 

271
00:25:15,230 --> 00:25:19,560
I'll stop by a couple times a week and receive reports from the manager.

272
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:24,040
You all have to work as you've been working.

273
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:26,400
- We understand, CEO. 
 - Yes.

274
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:44,180
That bastard Geum Tae Woong! He took away my bank?

275
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:49,440
Geez, my bank. My bank!

276
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:53,910
Kill that Geum Tae Woong and send him to hell!

277
00:25:59,350 --> 00:26:05,020
Call Prosecutor Baek Joon Soo in secret and tell him I want to see him.

278
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:07,420
Tell him to meet me for lunch tomorrow.

279
00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:09,520
I understand.

280
00:26:10,810 --> 00:26:12,570
How could he?

281
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,510
It's about time.

282
00:26:37,170 --> 00:26:40,570
Are you acting like my bodyguard because you think I can't protect myself?

283
00:26:40,570 --> 00:26:44,730
I'm so busy. A con artist, prosecutor, and now a bodyguard.

284
00:26:44,730 --> 00:26:48,130
Did I ask you to walk me home? Don't worry and go home.

285
00:26:48,130 --> 00:26:53,700
I have no choice because Prosecutor Baek Joon Soo asked me to.

286
00:26:58,150 --> 00:26:59,940
Bye.

287
00:27:28,630 --> 00:27:31,610
Prosecutor Baek, you're here.

288
00:27:32,310 --> 00:27:34,950
Come and sit here.

289
00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:38,110
Long time no see, Governor Choi.

290
00:27:42,390 --> 00:27:50,780
I'm going to make a confession to you.

291
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:56,920
The 100 billion won that disappeared from K-Savings Bank...

292
00:27:58,430 --> 00:28:01,680
I ordered him to come up with that money.

293
00:28:02,510 --> 00:28:10,800
But the bank manager committed suicide and that money disappeared.

294
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:13,330
I get paid by the prosecutors' office.

295
00:28:13,330 --> 00:28:17,900
What you just told me can be used as evidence for legal punishment against you.

296
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:21,730
But why are you telling me this?

297
00:28:21,730 --> 00:28:27,800
I have to show you what's inside my heart

298
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:31,360
so that you can trust me.

299
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:40,500
That money. Geum Tae Woong. He took it.

300
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:49,540
I ended up putting that 100 billion won inside my bad son-in-law's mouth.

301
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:55,730
I've been watching you all this time, Prosecutor Baek.

302
00:28:55,730 --> 00:28:59,980
I believe you're a sharp and competent prosecutor.

303
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:04,870
This case. Please come up with an indictment.

304
00:29:04,870 --> 00:29:11,220
Pardon me, but can I ask you why you came up with that  100 billion won?

305
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:13,420
For a contract.

306
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:18,960
Developing natural gas from Turkistan. Exclusive rights.

307
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:25,550
If we can get gas from there, an enormous amount of profit will become a reality.

308
00:29:25,550 --> 00:29:32,590
Prosecutor Baek, I'll give you more than enough money to live out the rest of your life.

309
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:43,590
When the sea bass season arrives, mugwort starts to grow on the hills.

310
00:29:43,590 --> 00:29:50,870
In my childhood, father brought home sea bass around this time of the year.

311
00:29:50,870 --> 00:29:57,640
And my mother would dig for mugwort and make a stew with the sea bass. It was so delicious!

312
00:29:59,750 --> 00:30:03,400
Now, now, eat. It's delicious.

313
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:30,650
Governor Choi met whom?

314
00:30:30,650 --> 00:30:33,010
He met with Prosecutor Baek Joon Soo.

315
00:30:33,010 --> 00:30:37,510
The two of them met at a Japanese restaurant for lunch.

316
00:30:38,830 --> 00:30:44,010
Don't you think Prosecutor Baek is up to something working with Governor Choi?

317
00:30:44,010 --> 00:30:50,770
It's a good thing. I can test Prosecutor Baek at this chance.

318
00:30:50,770 --> 00:30:54,140
Tell him to come by after work. Say I have something to say to him.

319
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:57,670
Don't let him sense anything.

320
00:30:57,670 --> 00:30:59,570
I understand.

321
00:31:36,330 --> 00:31:41,510
Director Kim. What do you think hell is?

322
00:31:42,330 --> 00:31:44,170
I never thought about it.

323
00:31:44,170 --> 00:31:49,780
Hell is a world where there's no one to love.

324
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:54,670
A world where you can't trust anyone. Don't you think that would be hell?

325
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:16,480
When I lift the teacup and put it to my mouth, that's my signal.

326
00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:20,120
Don't hesitate and hit him with it.

327
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:22,220
I understand.

328
00:32:24,650 --> 00:32:28,270
Prosecutor Baek, it's almost time for him to be here.

329
00:32:28,270 --> 00:32:30,400
Let's go up.

330
00:32:33,210 --> 00:32:36,770
I'm so busy. Who the heck does he think he is telling me to come and go?

331
00:32:46,830 --> 00:32:48,210
Thank you.

332
00:32:48,210 --> 00:32:54,210
What do you like to eat, Prosecutor Baek? I'd like to treat you to a nice dinner at a nice restaurant.

333
00:32:54,210 --> 00:32:57,020
I usually eat at the commissary in the prosecutors' office.

334
00:32:57,020 --> 00:32:59,790
Then, today, too?

335
00:33:03,510 --> 00:33:06,080
I'd like to eat there.

336
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:09,200
What was your lunch menu today?

337
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:11,090
The mugwort soup.

338
00:33:14,390 --> 00:33:18,840
It must be in season. The mugwort scent was nice and tasted good.

339
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:23,510
I ate natural sea bass sashimi and ate rice with mugwort soup.

340
00:33:23,510 --> 00:33:26,180
Inside the commissary

341
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:29,610
you ate sea bass sashimi?

342
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:45,120
