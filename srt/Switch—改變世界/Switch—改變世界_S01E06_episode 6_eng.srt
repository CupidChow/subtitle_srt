1
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:19,770
Has he ever gained consciousness even for a moment?

2
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:23,680
Not at all. His vitals are stable.

3
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,680
Please continue to take good care of him.

4
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:29,690
If he wakes up at all, please call me right away.

5
00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:31,390
Of course.

6
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:50,090
I was so happy when I heard that you were coming back to Seoul. But what's with this?

7
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:56,770
I've been waiting for a long time, Sunbae.

8
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:18,090
 Sunbae, should I get myself in trouble and follow you to Sokcho? 

9
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:22,910
 Be bold and work hard even if I'm not here. Don't let them talk behind your back. 

10
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:29,070
 I'm not a kid. I've been working at the prosecutors' office for three years already. 

11
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:43,350
 Are you going to take her with you? 

12
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:46,720
 I'm just concerned that you might break it taking her with you. 

13
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:49,830
 I'll give it back to you when you come back to Seoul. 

14
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:52,950
 Don't you break it. 

15
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:02,600
 I'm leaving. 

16
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:06,740
 Sunbae. I won't give up. 

17
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:10,310
 I'm saying I won't give up on the investigation. 

18
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:16,080
 The ones who got you in trouble... I'll be sure to catch them. 

19
00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:00,590
Because you're down, Sunbae, I got to work with this real weirdo.

20
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:03,400
It's a long complicated story.

21
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:07,000
But he really looks like you.

22
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,670
You'd faint if you saw him. No. You can't faint again.

23
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:19,420
In any case, I don't know what it is, but he's not ordinary.

24
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:25,520
If you don't wake up, I'm going to keep working with him.

25
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:28,620
You might not have a position to return to.

26
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:32,920
So ...

27
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:36,650
Will you wake up soon?

28
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:19,360
Oh, look, look, look at this. Oh, it feels so nice.

29
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:23,370
Wow, what's there to life? Eat warm foodâ€”

30
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:24,790
All right! I ate it.

31
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:26,960
Poop well.

32
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,990
Ugh, crap!

33
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:32,730
Straighten your legs and sleep well. That's all there's to it.

34
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:35,590
If you live like that, life is no fun.

35
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:43,130
Don't you need some thrills in life?

36
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:48,210
Who is he?

37
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:50,290
A new customer we're going to set up. 
  Cha Myeong Soo
 Age: 40
 Occupation: Diplomat 

38
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:54,450
I found him in Prosecutor Baek's notes. He's a likely drug transport suspect.

39
00:04:54,450 --> 00:04:58,600
Don't you think we'd get something out of him?

40
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:04,870
 Cha Myeong Soo; Age: 40; Birthdate 11/08/79; Occupation: Diplomat 

41
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:10,610
 Director Bong, fake a heart attack. 

42
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:18,320
 Eun Ji, you used to be a nurse, so do your thing. 

43
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,690
I'm a nurse!

44
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:27,130
That won't work.

45
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:33,750
 In Tae, you create a super fast downloading program. 

46
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:41,450
They should call an ambulance.

47
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:50,020
Excuse me, but have you seen a cell phone lying around here?

48
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:52,650
A cell phone?

49
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:55,400
Well, I'm not sure.

50
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,950
- What color was it?
 - Gray.

51
00:05:57,950 --> 00:06:04,200
Oh, too common. Over there. It's over there.

52
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:16,630
Excuse me, but could this be yours?

53
00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:20,210
Yes, thank you. But where did you find it?

54
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:24,150
- I found it over there. 
 - But the patient...

55
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:28,730
- I used to be a nurse. I can revive him with my eyes closed.
 - I see.

56
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:34,580
But you know... What do you do for a living?

57
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:37,920
Well, I just...

58
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:54,880
But you know... Prosecutor Baek Joon Soo... are you really sure?

59
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,560
What are you saying?

60
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:00,920
I can't guarantee it, but

61
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:05,880
it occurred to me that we might be dealing with a phantom.

62
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:15,560
I'm Gil Dae Ro. You summoned me.

63
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:22,110
If you look down from atop, it's nice because you get a broader view.

64
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:26,240
But I can't see things in detail.

65
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:30,400
Baek Joon Soo.

66
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,660
Are you talking about Baek Joon Soo?

67
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:44,050
Let me ask you for a favor.

68
00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:47,710
You know Prosecutor Baek Joon Soo in Criminal Investigation Division 6? Give me his personnel information.

69
00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:52,010
Personnel information? You need to follow procedure for that.

70
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:54,630
That's why I said I'm asking you for a favor.

71
00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:57,610
Would I say that if I am to follow the procedure to get that information?

72
00:07:57,610 --> 00:08:00,880
I said I'm asking you for a favor!  A favor! Ah, seriously.

73
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:07,390
Isn't it this? Don't you know who I am?

74
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:10,980
- Get that and send it to me via intranet email. Got it? 
 - Okay.

75
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,530
 General Affairs Division 

76
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:22,970
Go Gi Bong.

77
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:28,190
Yes, Prosecutor Gil Dae Ro, what is it?

78
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:31,490
I'm really sorry, but look over there.

79
00:08:32,430 --> 00:08:37,670
Is that okay to do? We are the Central District Prosecutors' Office after all. There's no sense of basic order, huh?

80
00:08:37,670 --> 00:08:43,430
- Ah, yes, you're right. 
 - I'm sure you saw it as you walked by. But you just kept walking.

81
00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:49,740
That's not just a cup. It signifies people throwing away their own conscience. People have no conscience.

82
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:52,090
I'll clean that up right away.

83
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:59,940
Did he eat something wrong today? How dare he.

84
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:04,280
No, Gi Bong. You did well to hold it in. You're the man.

85
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:08,110
Please give us cartilage and soju.

86
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:13,980
I don't know how I should apologize to you.

87
00:09:14,770 --> 00:09:19,280
What are you saying? If a prosecutor did wrong, he should be investigated, too.

88
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:22,650
Your initiative ... so cool.

89
00:09:22,650 --> 00:09:26,810
I really respect you, Sunbaenim.

90
00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:29,330
What do you mean "sunbaenim," Prosecutor?

91
00:09:29,330 --> 00:09:33,880
You're older than me. That makes you a sunbaenim in life.

92
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:39,020
Let's not be like that. Outside of work like this, I'll just call you "Hyung" while we're at it.

93
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:42,050
Here, take a drink from me, Hyung.

94
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:51,720
I've worked with so many prosecutors before.

95
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:57,520
I've never met anyone who treated me so kindly as a person like you, Prosecutor Baek.

96
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:02,590
Even though I've done something incredibly rude to you, you call me Hyung.

97
00:10:03,130 --> 00:10:08,200
How can I pay this debt to you? Oh, I'm tearing up for the first time in a long time.

98
00:10:11,450 --> 00:10:16,030
Then, can I ask you for a favor, Hyung?

99
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:19,550
Of course. Tell me whatever it may be.

100
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:22,510
Please review a case one more time.

101
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:24,530
A case.

102
00:10:24,530 --> 00:10:30,000
It was concluded as a suicide case on May 5, 1998.

103
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,890
By chance, was there circumstantial evidence that it might have been a murder? If there was,

104
00:10:33,890 --> 00:10:37,300
who is the most likely suspect? Please find that out for me.

105
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:40,030
Who is the deceased?

106
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:45,100
Sa Ma Cheong.

107
00:10:47,330 --> 00:10:50,860
Is it someone you know?

108
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:54,980
No, he has nothing to do with me.

109
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:58,180
I just want to look into it.

110
00:10:58,180 --> 00:11:02,260
Oh, yeah. Keep this a secret from Prosecutor Oh.

111
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:05,160
You and I are the only ones who know about this.

112
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:09,010
Of course, Prosecutor. I'll keep that in mind.

113
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:12,490
Let me pour you a drink.

114
00:11:12,490 --> 00:11:14,270
- Thanks, Hyung. 
 - Hyung!

115
00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:41,600
 Flashback to his childhood 

116
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:45,750
Um... can I ask you for a favor?

117
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:48,080
A favor? What is it?

118
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:51,810
I lost my business and...

119
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:54,390
I have to get a loan from that bank over there.

120
00:11:54,390 --> 00:11:58,330
Will you be able to keep this icefish during that time?

121
00:11:58,330 --> 00:12:00,880
- Put it over there. 
 - Okay.

122
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:08,380
Thank you.

123
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:15,580
Please give me some children's vitamins.

124
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:21,020
Wow! It's a platinum arowana.

125
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:24,150
Ahjussi, this is a platinum arowana, right?

126
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:25,550
I don't know.

127
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:27,490
My dad is an oceanographer.

128
00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:31,080
It was sold for 3 million won at a Singapore auction.

129
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:33,150
- Three million? 
 - Ahjussi.

130
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:35,800
Sell it to me. Please?

131
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,690
Five million won would do, right?

132
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:39,350
Five million won?

133
00:12:41,710 --> 00:12:45,830
Someone asked me to keep this for a short time.

134
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:51,760
Then, I'll bring my dad over. Tell the owner to wait for us.

135
00:12:53,890 --> 00:12:55,630
 Aqua Garden
 Dr. Kim Gong Seong 

136
00:12:57,850 --> 00:13:02,800
What in the world? A fish like this goes for 5 million won?

137
00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:11,110
Did the things at the bank go over well?

138
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:13,870
That's too bad.

139
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:17,310
Sell that to me.

140
00:13:19,370 --> 00:13:22,490
This is very valuable.

141
00:13:22,490 --> 00:13:24,830
How much can you give me?

142
00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:27,530
One million won?

143
00:13:27,530 --> 00:13:32,910
Fine, fine, fine, I'll give you 500,000 more since I'm helping you out.

144
00:13:35,150 --> 00:13:39,650
1.5 million won. Forget it if you don't want it.

145
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:45,620
You should be glad you met someone like me.

146
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:47,600
Ah, yes. Thank you.

147
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,220
You can't say something later on.

148
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:52,090
Ah, yes.

149
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:58,050
What an idiot.

150
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:03,210
You have to use your brain not to get fooled.

151
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:10,790
He should either be a pharmacist or a lender. One or the other.

152
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:14,920
Grandma, I got the money from that guy.

153
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:18,890
Don't ever borrow money from that bastard.

154
00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:22,190
Thank you. Thank you so much.

155
00:14:22,190 --> 00:14:24,970
- All right then. 
 - Wait.

156
00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:27,800
Take some of this.

157
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:31,000
I'll take just this one. Take care.

158
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,140
- Thanks. 
 - Sure.

159
00:14:46,130 --> 00:14:48,900
Would you want to become a con artist?

160
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:54,160
You were pretty good. Who'd believe that it was a set up done by a 10-year-old?

161
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:59,280
It was simple yet had an impact. Excellent!

162
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:03,660
If Mozart was a musical genius, you're a genius in scamming.

163
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:08,060
Conning people is what I learned by watching even before I memorized my times tables. Where else would it go?

164
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:10,940
This is my first and last fraud.

165
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:14,930
Kiddo... Are you saying you're going to waste such a God-given talent?

166
00:15:14,930 --> 00:15:19,720
Hurry and grow up. If you and I combine our efforts, there will be nothing to be afraid in this world.

167
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:21,620
- Dad. 
 - What, kid?

168
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:25,080
I like you, Dad, but I don't like that you're a con artist.

169
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:27,730
Hey, there's no good and bad in occupations.

170
00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:30,020
I'll never become a con artist.

171
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:31,100
What will you do then?

172
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:34,450
A prosecutor. A prosecutor who catches the bad guys.

173
00:15:34,450 --> 00:15:38,500
Wow! Let's go.

174
00:15:39,930 --> 00:15:47,900
 Timing and

175
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:11,990
- You're home. 
 - Yeah.

176
00:16:11,990 --> 00:16:16,020
You said your back hurts. Why are you lying here? You should sleep in your room.

177
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:19,330
How can I sleep when my grown-up daughter isn't home yet?

178
00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:23,470
You want me to boil some crispy rice?

179
00:16:23,470 --> 00:16:24,830
Yeah.

180
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:27,660
Wait.

181
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:45,040
Ha Ra, soup made out of crispy rice is ready. Hurry up and come. Ha Ra.

182
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:01,000
Why do you work so hard?

183
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,980
You think doing that would change the world?

184
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:13,260
Just marry into a good family and live a comfortable life.

185
00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:36,010
Sunbae Gil, today is the Chief Prosecutor's birthday. Where are you going?

186
00:17:36,010 --> 00:17:37,850
I need to go down to a province to take care of something.

187
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:39,630
You're saying you won't be attending, right?

188
00:17:39,630 --> 00:17:43,970
You think I won't? I'm preparing a huge gift for him.

189
00:17:43,970 --> 00:17:45,600
See you later.

190
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:54,270
 13 Neo 6895 

191
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:01,420
Hey! Come over here.

192
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:06,100
You know Baek Joon Soo, right? The one who fell into the ocean.

193
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:08,800
I... I don't know...

194
00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:13,920
Should we help you remember?

195
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:31,160
Please go in this way. Lead the way. Welcome.

196
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:35,650
Why isn't he here yet?

197
00:18:35,650 --> 00:18:37,830
He should be here by now.

198
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:40,030
Come in, come in. Come.

199
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:48,870
Did you sweat it out at a club again?

200
00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:52,760
Boy, you sure have a lot of time for a reporter.

201
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:57,690
I have to heal my heart and body that's tired out from working so hard.

202
00:18:57,690 --> 00:18:59,870
This man is the son of a hospital director.

203
00:18:59,870 --> 00:19:03,530
And this man is the son of architectural firm owner. Which one seems better?

204
00:19:03,530 --> 00:19:06,500
I don't like any of them. I'm going to marry a prosecutor.

205
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:08,600
You think I'm asking you to go on a blind date? I'm talking about your sister!

206
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:11,150
I think Unni likes Prosecutor Baek Joon Soo.

207
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:14,470
Even if he opens up a law firm, it wouldn't compare to a hospital director.

208
00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:17,490
The two of them look more serious these days.

209
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:20,700
Unni is totally stuck to him. She must like him a lot.

210
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:22,390
So Ra.

211
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,590
Do you want me to buy you a purse? A Hermes?

212
00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:28,770
Really?

213
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:33,850
Oh So Ra, I'll give you a special mission.

214
00:19:33,850 --> 00:19:36,700
- Now what? 
 - So that the two of them can't date,

215
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:40,890
split them apart.

216
00:19:40,890 --> 00:19:45,100
Use whatever means possible, no matter what it takes.

217
00:19:46,330 --> 00:19:48,880
- In any case... 
 - Now what?

218
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,720
Do you also think...

219
00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:55,730
Do I resemble Audrey Hepburn?

220
00:19:55,730 --> 00:19:56,870
- Me? 
 - Huh?

221
00:19:56,870 --> 00:19:59,090
- Huh?   - No? 

222
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:02,600
That idea is not mine.

223
00:20:04,530 --> 00:20:07,260
It's the room at the end, Prosecutor.

224
00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:29,060
Thank you for being here with me.

225
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:31,020
Please relax and enjoy.

226
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:33,760
- Cheers! 
 - Cheers!

227
00:20:45,450 --> 00:20:49,980
Prosecutor, I'm always lacking, but I'll pour you a glass for you.

228
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:54,710
Here you go. Until the day our Chief Prosecutor becomes the next prosecutor general...

229
00:20:54,710 --> 00:20:58,030
I'll work hard and take good care of you!

230
00:20:58,030 --> 00:20:59,690
Please pour me a glass as well.

231
00:20:59,690 --> 00:21:01,320
Yes.

232
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:05,290
Happy birthday!

233
00:21:05,290 --> 00:21:07,490
Happy birthday!

234
00:21:07,490 --> 00:21:09,730
Thank you. Thank you.

235
00:21:09,730 --> 00:21:12,110
Yes. Clink.

236
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:17,380
Applause!

237
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:21,130
I'll take the bottle.

238
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:28,590
Where are you going? Hey!

239
00:21:28,590 --> 00:21:30,630
Probably going to the restroom.

240
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:40,300
Let's go!

241
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:42,310
Baek Joon Soo!

242
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:45,360
Where is our prosecutor!

243
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:46,240
Is he here?

244
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,390
What's going on...

245
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:50,990
Prosecutor Baek.

246
00:21:52,190 --> 00:21:53,600
What the heck?

247
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:57,660
- Prosecutor! 
 - Baek Joon Soo!

248
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:10,570
Drink, drink. Drink up.

249
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,150
I'm sorry to interrupt.

250
00:22:21,150 --> 00:22:25,090
I prepared a surprise to celebrate the Chief Prosecutor's birthday.

251
00:22:25,090 --> 00:22:26,480
A surprise?

252
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,710
What in the world?

253
00:22:28,710 --> 00:22:30,600
In our Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office,

254
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:36,020
there's a shocking thing that cannot and should not happen.

255
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:40,610
I'll reveal it in the presence of many sunbaes and hoobaes here.

256
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:45,340
Baek Joon Soo!

257
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:51,300
Everyone, Prosecutor Baek Joon Soo sitting here...

258
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:54,760
It's not really him.

259
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:00,240
He's a fake one who looks like him.

260
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:06,110
Gil Dae Ro, what are you doing?

261
00:23:06,110 --> 00:23:07,440
I'm sorry Deputy Chief Prosecutor Jin.

262
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:10,300
But I have proof.

263
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:12,310
Please come in.

264
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:26,480
This is Shin Jang Hoon. Prosecutor Baek Joon Soo's high school classmate.

265
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:33,960
But Prosecutor Baek, you didn't even glance at him and walked right past him when you came in earlier.

266
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:38,600
Even though someone who is not a prosecutor showed up at a gathering of prosecutors.

267
00:23:42,090 --> 00:23:45,200
Joon Soo, don't you know me?

268
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:48,620
Sorry.

269
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:54,650
It's because I'm at a work gathering. I guess you must've been extremely disappointed.

270
00:23:54,650 --> 00:23:57,040
I expected that level of excuse.

271
00:23:57,040 --> 00:24:01,210
Sunbae Gil, isn't this too much? Especially since the Chief Prosecutor is with us.

272
00:24:01,210 --> 00:24:03,680
You're crossing the line with your joke.

273
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:08,020
Whether I'm joking or not, we should check.

274
00:24:09,410 --> 00:24:12,790
According to him, back in high school with Prosecutor Baek,

275
00:24:12,790 --> 00:24:16,570
they were playing with fire in an abandoned house and both of them got burned.

276
00:24:16,570 --> 00:24:19,010
- Right? 
 - Yes.

277
00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:23,440
Here.

278
00:24:27,410 --> 00:24:33,840
How about it, Prosecutor Baek? Can you show us your burn scar in front of us?

279
00:24:38,870 --> 00:24:42,670
Prosecutor Gil, what are you going to do about ruining the mood here, huh?

280
00:24:42,670 --> 00:24:44,880
Prosecutor Yang, just a minute.

281
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:52,720
Is this my birthday surprise? It's interesting. Continue.

282
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:59,550
Prosecutor Baek, let's see. Is it over here?

283
00:25:09,150 --> 00:25:11,590
- He's not here. 
 - We looked everywhere, but he's not here.

284
00:25:11,590 --> 00:25:13,500
He's not here.

285
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:14,550
Seriously!

286
00:25:14,550 --> 00:25:17,120
Why are you doing this? There's no one like that here.

287
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:18,770
What do you mean there's no one like that here?

288
00:25:18,770 --> 00:25:22,150
The ambulance driver said he drove him here.

289
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:37,300
Wait, wait, wait.
  Controlled Area 

290
00:25:45,630 --> 00:25:51,620
You can't show it to us? Why not? Because you're fake!

291
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:55,160
What happened?

292
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:58,950
If you're not Prosecutor Baek Joon Soo, who exactly are you...

293
00:25:58,950 --> 00:26:02,320
A criminal offense of pretending to be a public official.

294
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:08,490
If people who cooperated in this fraud are present here, you're aware that you're accomplices, right?

295
00:26:10,690 --> 00:26:14,210
Um... that's actually... well...

296
00:26:14,210 --> 00:26:15,780
I said stop!

297
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:18,900
If he's real, he just has to show us.

298
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:23,920
If you're sure, show us.

299
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:32,950
 Controlled Area 

300
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:40,320
What should I do if I find him?

301
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:42,660
Bring him here quietly.

302
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:51,100
Let's go.

303
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:56,840
Why? You scared?

304
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:59,070
You can't show it to us?

305
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:08,690
Everyone, did you see that? He's fake.

306
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:15,390
Sunbae, stop it now. With so many people here...

307
00:27:15,390 --> 00:27:21,260
What sunbae? You're fake. If you're real, prove it.

308
00:27:22,890 --> 00:27:27,920
Joon Soo has a burn scar on the back of his left shoulder.

309
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:30,050
In a lightning shape.

310
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:44,630
Prosecutor Baek, I think it'd be better if you just show it if you want to clear everyone's suspicion.

311
00:27:57,860 --> 00:28:01,550
If you're curious, please excuse me.

312
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:09,080
You... you.

313
00:28:34,370 --> 00:28:36,460
What's going on?

314
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:40,730
What is he doing?

315
