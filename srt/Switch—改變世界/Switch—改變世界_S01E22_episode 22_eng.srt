1
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:18,090
With Governor Choi Jeong Pil...

2
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:22,150
at a Japanese restaurant.

3
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:31,840
He called me secretly.

4
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:37,060
He wanted to meet me quietly, so I met him.

5
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:41,620
You met Governor Choi Jeong Pil?

6
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:46,670
Governor Choi Jeong Pil doesn't know that I'm aligned with you.

7
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:54,700
I see.

8
00:00:56,690 --> 00:01:03,730


9
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:10,800
So, what did he say?

10
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:18,800
He asked me to get rid of you, CEO Geum.

11
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:27,500
He asked me to get rid of you working with him.

12
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:31,690
And the reason you're telling me all that?

13
00:01:31,690 --> 00:01:34,760
Until I catch the con artist Sa Do Chan,

14
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:37,340
I'll work with you, CEO.

15
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:51,650
I was going to treat you to a nice place, but I guess it's not time yet.

16
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:59,110
And? Did he say anything else?

17
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:02,410
Turkistan.

18
00:02:02,410 --> 00:02:04,870
Huh?

19
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:09,700
He's thinking of investing in the natural gas industry.

20
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:15,340
Why is he so obsessed with gas which isn't even tangible?

21
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:20,450
I'm thinking of catching Governor Choi Jeong Pil with that information.

22
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:25,660
Didn't you give me an assignment?

23
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:29,100
Saying to pull the plug on Choi Jeong Pil.

24
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:35,700
I'm thinking of leaving Governor Choi alone, so that he'll move forward with that gas industry business.

25
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:42,150
If it's all a scam, he will explode like gas and will disappear.

26
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:46,210
If that business has a real potential,

27
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:52,010
I can say he received an illegal kickback  and violated international currency laws.

28
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:54,210
And I'll stop him.

29
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:23,530
I heard that they put together a team of expert investigators

30
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:26,400
with the deputy secretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade and even the director of the Public Oil Corporation.

31
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:31,780
I guess he wasn't happy with his last trip? Governor Choi is very meticulous.

32
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:37,410
Don't worry too much. I got close to the royals working hard for the last 10 years.

33
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:40,800
It's a project we worked on together bribing them.

34
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:44,230
I already called the site. He'll never detect anything.

35
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:48,600
I trust your skills, but you can't let your guard down even for a moment.

36
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:52,740
Of course. Governor Choi... He's flaming hot right now.

37
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:56,290
I think he's coming up with the investment selling all the land, buildings, factories,

38
00:03:56,290 --> 00:03:59,460
and everything he hid all over the country.

39
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:03,410
Right. He has to gather everything in one place like that

40
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:06,360
so that we can eat it all up in one bite.

41
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:11,670
The problem is ...  Brown Bear.

42
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:13,630
That's right.

43
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:17,910
Do you think Geum Tae Woong will reach out as you anticipated?

44
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:22,430
Geum Tae Woong? I know him well.

45
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:27,060
The more you deceive people, the more mistrust you have.

46
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:30,930
He would've never fell for it if we approached Geum Tae Woong first.

47
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:34,350
Because Choi Jeong Pil is greedy about it, Geum Tae Woong covets for it.

48
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:36,970
Because other people's fortune looks better than their own.

49
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:41,400
Thanks.

50
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:45,780
You even closed down your successful business willing to help me out.

51
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:48,900
Hyungnim, how can you say that?

52
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:51,860
I almost got killed being chased by the Russian mafia.

53
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:55,830
You're my lifesaver who saved me then.

54
00:04:55,830 --> 00:05:02,510
I don't feel my life is wasted even if I die helping you out, Hyungnim.

55
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:05,430
All right.

56
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,900
I'm going to the countryside.

57
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,790
Turkistan's Gates of Hell?

58
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:29,930
It smells fishy. We should dig into this.

59
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:33,110
What do you mean? We're busy enough trying to reveal Geum Tae Woong's criminal activity.

60
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:37,900
I know. I'm saying we should try to entangle him with this.

61
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:38,710
How?

62
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:42,500
Look. Choi Jeong Pil is trying to invest in this business.

63
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:45,620
Geum Tae Woong is suspicious and is watching him on the sideline.

64
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:50,180
If he sees that there's a real potential in this business, he'll surely want to take it away in the middle.

65
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:52,230
You're well aware that they had a falling out, right?

66
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:56,000
Conduct an identification investigation and catch them at the most critical moment.

67
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,780
That's right.

68
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:04,980
Oh, yeah. That popcorn vendor.

69
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:07,750
The one who talked about time of pressure and discipline, yadda, yadda, yadda.

70
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:13,190
That master of words? Why? You want to meet him and have a battle of words?

71
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:16,630
I smell mastery in him. He's not ordinary.

72
00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:21,670
I guess. He had a prosthetic on his left hand.

73
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:23,220
A prosthetic?

74
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:26,150
Don't you think he's got a story?

75
00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:34,480
How about we eat out? I've never been to your family restaurant.

76
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:36,350
Our place?

77
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,060
Sure.

78
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:44,580
 Ttorae Orae Chicken 

79
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,330
Welcome. How many in your party?

80
00:06:49,090 --> 00:06:53,450
Hello, I'm Baek Joon Soo working with Prosecutor Oh Ha Ra.

81
00:06:53,450 --> 00:06:58,310
Oh, Baek Joon Sâ€” Oh! That Baek Joon Soo?

82
00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:03,450
I heard a lot about you from Prosecutor Oh. Our team is having a department dinner here tonight.

83
00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:08,900
I see. You seem much different than what Ha Ra told me.

84
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:12,770
You're so handsome and you have a great personality.

85
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:14,540
I know.

86
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:19,140
But have you heard that you resemble someone?

87
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:24,930
- Who was it? A movie star. Audrey Hepburn!
 - Oh, my.

88
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:31,920
Right? Your eye lashes look just like Audrey Hepburn's.

89
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:34,950
There aren't that many people who says such things,

90
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:37,950
but there is one person who said exactly the same thing.

91
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:42,020
- Prosecutor Oh must be pretty because she takes after you. 
 - Oh, my.

92
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:46,260
You have such high-class taste in seeing people, Prosecutor Baek.

93
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:49,680
 Hello! 

94
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,010
Hello!

95
00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:52,610
Welcome!

96
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:53,970
Have a seat here.

97
00:07:53,970 --> 00:07:56,360
Let them in.

98
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,540
Prosecutor Baek, you came early.

99
00:07:57,540 --> 00:07:59,610
Yes, I was earning some brownie points being here early.

100
00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:03,090
- Huh? 
 - What brownie points?

101
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:05,130
I should've come by sooner.

102
00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:06,830
I should've done so sooner.

103
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:09,670
- Have a seat. 
 - It's on me tonight.

104
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:17,830
Baek Joon Soo is so different than what you said. He's so great. I like him.

105
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:19,530
What do you mean, so great?

106
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:21,670
Hey, hey, come here.

107
00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:24,770
 Cheers! 

108
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:26,540
Cheers!

109
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:27,870
- Thank you! 
 - Enjoy!

110
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:28,690
We will eat well!

111
00:08:28,690 --> 00:08:30,770
Prosecuter Oh, tell your mother

112
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:33,400
not to give us any discount.

113
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,030
Yes.

114
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:42,760
I'm so glad we came here. It's good.

115
00:08:44,770 --> 00:08:47,200
At the end of this alley.

116
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:51,090
Excuse me.

117
00:08:53,530 --> 00:08:55,770
He's here.

118
00:08:55,770 --> 00:08:57,670
Wait here.

119
00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:04,000
 No way... 

120
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:10,070
Excuse me, sir.

121
00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:13,860
What?

122
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:16,800
What? You want some popcorn?

123
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:21,600
It's a different person. What happened to the man who was usually here?

124
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,770
He sold the spot to me and left.

125
00:09:23,770 --> 00:09:26,670
He said this is a great spot.

126
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:30,270
He said he established customer flow in this spot. He says it's a great spot for business.

127
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:31,480
Ahjussi, you were fooled.

128
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:34,550
Stop rambling on and buy some popcorn.

129
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:35,860
Okay.

130
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:42,050
Sa Do Chan, is everything alright with him?

131
00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:46,540
Prosecutor Baek, just worry about yourself.

132
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:49,560
How did you live with your blood pressure like this?

133
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:55,830
So awful. I didn't know your condition was so serious.

134
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:58,800
Eun Ji.

135
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:05,540
Don't look at me like that. You're making me fluttery.

136
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:08,010
You look just like Oppa Do Chan.

137
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:16,670
Eun Ji. Please keep my condition a secret from Prosecutor Oh for now.

138
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:20,180
I don't like to keep secrets like this.

139
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:22,350
I beg you.

140
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:26,910
 Fox 

141
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:33,530
Prosecutor Oh? Right now...

142
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:38,790
He's fine.

143
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:42,210
He's eating well and sleeps well.

144
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:55,780
How about Victor's record on his entry into the country?

145
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:58,520
Yes, he arrived in Korea on March 2018 with his subordinates.

146
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:01,600
He's staying in the Westin Hotel suite room until now.

147
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,910
Wow, doesn't it cost several million won a night to stay there?

148
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:06,420
I guess he is really rich.

149
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:08,440
He looks real to just about anyone, right?

150
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:13,330
He's real. There's no way a businessman like this would be a scammer.

151
00:11:13,330 --> 00:11:17,100
That's why I'm more suspicious.

152
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:20,220
There are five steps to conning.

153
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:23,920
Drop the bait, gain trust, stir ambition, cause them to do wrong, and

154
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:27,280
wrap and run.

155
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:30,500
Currently, he's developing these five steps.

156
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:33,070
Then, what's the bait?

157
00:11:33,070 --> 00:11:35,000
The exclusive rights to the natural gas.

158
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,620
How about gaining trust?

159
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:41,550
A successful Russian businessman stays in an expensive hotel and only meets with powerful people.

160
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:48,120
How about stirring ambition? If the gas is actually developed, you can profit enormously.

161
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:50,520
How about wrongdoing?

162
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:53,960
Illegal rebate from Turkistan's gas case and violation of foreign currency management.

163
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:56,290
You have to commit these wrongdoings to bring profit out of it.

164
00:11:56,290 --> 00:12:02,020
You feel like a customer came in and ordered three large pizzas, but walks away after eating only one slice.

165
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:03,870
Bingo!

166
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:07,640
So, I believe this project is a con job.

167
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:10,670
But there's no evidence.

168
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:13,570
Wow, this is like a movie that hasn't premiered yet.

169
00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:18,910
Deputy Prosecutor, you're right. We can't get them until the con job has been completed.

170
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:26,470
By chance, does this Victor have dual citizenship?

171
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:28,600
Just a moment.

172
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,630
Ah, yes, you're right. How did you know?

173
00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:34,430
He has dual citizenship in Russia and Turkistan.

174
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:39,530
I'm sure he made some noise coming into Korea with his Russian passport.

175
00:12:39,530 --> 00:12:42,770
I'm sure he grabbed a lot of attention throwing a party.

176
00:12:42,770 --> 00:12:45,310
If he came in for the purpose of fraud,

177
00:12:45,310 --> 00:12:47,830
he would've come in before, using his Turkistan passport.

178
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:49,380
A step to gather his information beforehand

179
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:54,150
so that he can deceive his targets.

180
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:59,060
Inspector Im, please look into Victor's Turkistan passport and his record of travels.

181
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:01,160
Yes, I got it.

182
00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:15,290
I think Sa Do Chan found out about Victor coming to Korea via a ship secretly.

183
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:23,750
As expected, he's not ordinary. Is he going to catch me and take me away at this rate?

184
00:13:29,070 --> 00:13:30,320
 - Dad. 
 - Huh? 

185
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,440
 I'm going to become a prosecutor when I grow up. 

186
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:35,400
 A prosecutor? I told you're you're more talented in conning. 

187
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:38,030
 No, I'm not! I'm going to be a prosecutor. 

188
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:43,140
 If you're still scamming then, I'll arrest you. 

189
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:46,680
 Hey, I'm way advanced. How would you catch me? 

190
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:49,020
 Hey, catch me! Catch me! 

191
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,300
Yes?

192
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:58,790
Room service.

193
00:13:58,790 --> 00:14:01,090
Thank you.

194
00:14:05,290 --> 00:14:09,140
Korean beef steak, strawberry salad, and bread are prepared.

195
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:12,690
- I'll pour you some coffee first. 
 - Thank you.

196
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:18,770
Hot!

197
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:20,470
Hot!

198
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:21,930
 System Hacked 

199
00:14:21,930 --> 00:14:22,760
 Downloading 

200
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,890
 Downloading 

201
00:14:27,290 --> 00:14:28,080
Oh, no!

202
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,740
Are you okay?

203
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:31,960
I'm so sorry!

204
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,440
I'll take care of it.

205
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:36,200
It's okay.

206
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,120
I'm almost done.

207
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:43,030
These are photos Victor took. Take a look.

208
00:14:46,310 --> 00:14:49,970
As expected, Choi Jeong Pil and Geum Tae Woong were his targets.

209
00:14:49,970 --> 00:14:52,230
When did he take that picture?

210
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:53,990
Wait.

211
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,490
10 days before he arrived in Korea.

212
00:14:57,490 --> 00:15:00,770
How could he have taken pictures when he wasn't in Korea?

213
00:15:00,770 --> 00:15:02,370
He has dual citizenship.

214
00:15:02,370 --> 00:15:05,650
Before he came in with his Russian passport, he had come in first with his Turkistan passport.

215
00:15:05,650 --> 00:15:08,660
There's the answer. He came in secret to obtain the photos.

216
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:12,330
He left, then he came back in grabbing people's attention.

217
00:15:12,330 --> 00:15:13,420
This is a con job.

218
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:14,870
It is.

219
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:17,300
It is a con job.

220
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:19,290
Should we set it up properly?

221
00:15:19,290 --> 00:15:23,120
Great! It's a setting! How are we going to do this?

222
00:15:33,070 --> 00:15:35,770
My name is Baek Joon Soo.

223
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:40,340
 I'm going to use my prosecutor ID and let Geum Tae Woong meet the Turkistan ambassador. 

224
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:42,030
 Building trust. 

225
00:15:42,030 --> 00:15:44,800
 The partnership project planning has taken over a year. 

226
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:48,920
 We're finally done with all the preparations. 

227
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:53,060
 Let's work together from now on. 

228
00:15:55,730 --> 00:15:57,500
Over here.

229
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:01,530
You called...

230
00:16:01,530 --> 00:16:06,030
Yes. I am manager Gong Yeon Do from Ikapo Promotion Agency.

231
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,500
I'm Reporter Yang Shim Mo.

232
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:18,140
Come this way.

233
00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:28,730
This is Duriki Ayasanmada Coran Dukis.

234
00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:30,860
The third nephew of the prince.

235
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:34,070
 Next, we'll use a reporter and leak the information to the press. 

236
00:16:34,070 --> 00:16:38,150
 Eunji, you do the PR. Director Bong, you play the VIP from Turkmenistan. 

237
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:40,530
 In Tae, you be the interpreter. 

238
00:16:40,530 --> 00:16:44,240
He says he's glad to meet you.

239
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,610
Come on.

240
00:16:50,730 --> 00:16:54,130
So, what is the story you're going to give me?

241
00:16:54,130 --> 00:16:55,540
Here.

242
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:59,870
The details are in here. Please do a good job.

243
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:04,110
 Turkistan Resource Development Corporation 
 Promotional Materials for Korean-Turkistan Economic Cooperation 

244
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:13,270
Come on.

245
00:17:15,430 --> 00:17:19,090
It's a small amount, but please have dinner on us with your staff.

246
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:30,970
I'll write a big story for you.

247
00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:32,620
Trust me.

248
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:34,330
Good.

249
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:39,390
 Will it be possible to import Turkistan's natural gas? If it happens, the expected profit is one trillion. 

250
00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:42,070
Why is such an article coming out?

251
00:17:42,070 --> 00:17:46,800
If the rumor spreads, more flies will gather around.

252
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:47,870
I have to hurry this up.

253
00:17:47,870 --> 00:17:52,160
 When the article is published, Choi Jeong Pil will rush things in the fear that someone else will take it away. 

254
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:55,470
The expected profit is one trillion?

255
00:17:55,470 --> 00:17:58,950
 Geum Tae Woong will start getting greedy 

256
00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:01,990
 because the grass is always greener on the other side. 

257
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:12,430
The second expert investigators have arrived.

258
00:18:12,430 --> 00:18:13,490
How are their reactions?

259
00:18:13,490 --> 00:18:20,400
I met the expert who came with Secretary Yoon, and he said the business seems to have lots of potential.

260
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:25,400
This old man. Is he really going to hit the jackpot?

261
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:29,710
Call Victor. I'll have to meet him in person.

262
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:31,740
All right.

263
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:09,780
Of course... my head is clearing up.

264
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:10,950
He appeared?

265
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:15,210
All right. Watch him! Don't be distracted! Oh, he hung up.

266
00:19:16,290 --> 00:19:20,300
Do Chan, Geum Tae Woong showed up to meet Victor.

267
00:19:22,170 --> 00:19:27,230
The suspicious catfish is slowly approaching the bait.

268
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:30,380
I'll increase the kickback.

269
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:35,730
I'm sorry. I'm a businessman who believes in trust.

270
00:19:35,730 --> 00:19:39,260
Isn't profit everything to a businessman?

271
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:44,760
The commission that's due to you, I'll multiply that by 10.

272
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:50,560
Please go home.

273
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:55,100
I'm a businessman, not a con artist.

274
00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:31,600
I snuck a peak at the investigation info.

275
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:37,830
Prosecutor Oh Ha Ra.I think she's investigating you.

276
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:43,730
She thinks Chief Prosecutor's suicide was a murder.

277
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,880
Geum Tae Woong?

278
00:21:09,950 --> 00:21:14,300
Prosecutor Oh, going home now? Aigoo...

279
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:16,220
Aren't you working too hard?

280
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:21,440
If you collapse working so hard like that... You should think of your family.

281
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:24,020
How did you come here?

282
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:30,150
I know someone around here. I ran into you by coincidence.

283
00:21:30,150 --> 00:21:32,310
Do you live in this neighborhood?

284
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:38,240
How dare you threaten me?

285
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:42,240
Does a Korean Prosecutor look like nothing to you?

286
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:46,660
You must be very nervous because I'm investigating you.

287
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:57,110
Prosecutor Baek Joon Soo and I decided to work together for a big goal.

288
00:21:57,110 --> 00:22:05,250
Prosecutor Oh, if you look at the world more broadly and grander, you'd see a different world.

289
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:10,190
I don't have time to see a different world.

290
00:22:16,730 --> 00:22:18,860
Please go home.

291
00:22:48,690 --> 00:22:52,360
Prosecutor Oh! Why did you go home by yourself? Was everything okay?

292
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:57,250
What do you mean? Don't worry. I'll protect myself.

293
00:22:58,550 --> 00:23:00,790
She complains even when I volunteer to be her bodyguard.

294
00:23:00,790 --> 00:23:02,990
Forget it.

295
00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:15,770
Why is my heart bouncing so hard tonight?

296
00:23:15,770 --> 00:23:18,930
Is it because I'm meeting someone big?

297
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:31,300
CEO, Mr Jo is here.

298
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:34,130
Seong Do?

299
00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:52,090
One more time. Please give me one more chance.

300
00:23:53,830 --> 00:23:56,330
I'm sorry.

301
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:19,760
Catching that Brown Bear. It's only a matter of time.

302
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:24,130
I'll proceed with everything as planned and wrap it up perfectly.

303
00:24:51,550 --> 00:24:52,790
Who are you?

304
00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:55,640
I'm from the Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office.

305
00:25:11,130 --> 00:25:14,540
I'm Prosecutor Baek Joon Soo of Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office, Criminal Division 6.

306
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:18,020
Victor Jang, you're under arrest without a warrant.

307
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:23,280
What do you mean under immediate arrest? I'm speechless. What is the reason?

308
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:27,490
It's for a violation of the Punishment of Minor Offenses  Act 1, article 16.

309
00:25:27,490 --> 00:25:29,090
The minor offense law?

310
00:25:29,090 --> 00:25:32,860
You threw away trash on the road.

311
00:25:33,730 --> 00:25:38,550
I can pay the fine. Yet the prosecutor came in person?

312
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:43,820
Why are you being like this? You played a trick, didn't you?

313
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:47,950
I have no idea what you're talking about.

314
00:25:53,690 --> 00:25:58,740
You had come into this country with your Russian subordinates creating much ruckus on this day.

315
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:02,730
You even had a party at this hotel with your guests.

316
00:26:02,730 --> 00:26:07,100
Looks like you tried very hard to grab people's attention.

317
00:26:08,970 --> 00:26:14,940
But 10 days before that, you came to Korea

318
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:17,420
via a cruise ship from Vladivostok.

319
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:20,270
Why would you have done that?

320
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:30,900
Your identity isn't what I'm after.

321
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:33,630
Because you're only a roper.

322
00:26:33,630 --> 00:26:36,700
 Roper: Slang that describes a person who approaches the target to set up a trap 

323
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:40,650
You're not the planner of this con job.

324
00:26:40,650 --> 00:26:43,030
You're only setting up a trap.

325
00:26:47,030 --> 00:26:54,120
What I want to know is the hidden planner of this con job.

326
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:45,700
Nice to meet you, Prosecutor Baek Joon Soo.

327
00:27:54,720 --> 00:28:01,820


328
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:04,870
â™«  Crazy other world  â™«

329
00:28:04,870 --> 00:28:08,920
â™«  Crazy&nbsp; A Choice like fate  â™«

331
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:12,630
 Switch 

332
00:28:12,630 --> 00:28:15,100
 We need one more player for this project. 

333
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:17,200
 Pull a scam together? 

334
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:19,390
 Let's pull a big one! 

335
00:28:19,390 --> 00:28:22,400
 How could someone with 2 billion won run a 200 billion business? 

336
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:25,790
 All the locked up accounts with different names will be released and will be gathered in one place. 

337
00:28:25,790 --> 00:28:28,480
 How long did you think you'd be able to play me? 

338
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:29,730
 Something seems weird. 

339
00:28:29,730 --> 00:28:31,090
 Is it tomorrow finally? 

340
00:28:31,090 --> 00:28:32,700
  I'm done playing around. 

341
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:34,420
 In Tae, it's a trap. 

342
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:35,670
 Hyung Do Chan isn't answering his phone. 

343
00:28:35,670 --> 00:28:39,490
 Shall we begin our party?
