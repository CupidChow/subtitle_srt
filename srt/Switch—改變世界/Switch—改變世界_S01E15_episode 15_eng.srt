1
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:49,020
Hey!

2
00:00:53,600 --> 00:01:00,350


3
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:11,940
Y-Y-You!

4
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:15,390
Hi. Bang Bang War.

5
00:01:31,930 --> 00:01:35,040
You are curious about my identity, right?

6
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:44,810
I'm a con artist.

7
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:48,040
But I followed you to the Prosecutors' Office and confirmed it last time.

8
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:51,170
Oh. Thanks to you, I'm pretending to be a prosecutor.

9
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:52,310
Pretending?

10
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:57,120
The real Baek Joon Soo got hurt at Sokcho.

11
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:01,050
 I've been watching Baek Joon Soo from Sokcho. 

12
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:03,340
 It's not an innocent bystander. 

13
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:10,110
So, I'm a con artist and a prosecutor. At the same time, I am a prosecutor who is a con artist.

14
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:16,600
Think about it. A capable con artist like me has even gained an identity as a prosecutor.

15
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:21,060
I've got wings on my two shoulders. Got it?

16
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:26,730
So, while I'm at it, I'm painting a big picture.

17
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:34,520
Geum Tae Woong, the CEO of Feel Gallery. I'm setting things up against him. About 300 billion won worth?

18
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,040
300 billion...

19
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:46,610
But there's this one guy who gets in my way.

20
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:54,830
- You.
 - Me? Why me?

21
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,720
 Cement 

22
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,090
Everything is ready.

23
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:10,880
Don't blame me too much.

24
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:14,760
It's a project worth 300 billion won. Shouldn't I get rid of something that gets in the way?

25
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:19,370
P-P-Please spare me.

26
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:23,590
I'm sorry.

27
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:28,060
I have loose lips. I just told you a secret you shouldn't know.

28
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:33,330
I-I-I  won't tell, I promise. I won't.

29
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:38,680
 Prosecutor Oh 

30
00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:41,860
Yes?

31
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:44,520
I think our game is almost over.

32
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,670
I got the fingerprint analysis from the belt.

33
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:51,490
You know that person as well.

34
00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:53,310
I know that person?

35
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:55,810
Joo Seong Doo.

36
00:03:57,370 --> 00:04:00,450
The target of this setting is someone who has gone a long distance.

37
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:04,820
Someone who came back from the Southeast tour, our

38
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:07,480
Bang Bang War.

39
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:14,380
 Moodari Restaurant 

40
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:17,000
Where are you?

41
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,730
Really? How many people?

42
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:27,670
- Aunty.
 -Yes?

43
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:29,680
Do you know this person?

44
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,220
- I heard he comes here often. 
- I don't know him at all.

45
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:34,130
- Really? 
 - Yes.

46
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,580
This bastard, really.

47
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:41,730
Ah... water, water, water.

48
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:58,080
Ahjumma, where is the bathroom here?

49
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,450
Let's share.

50
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,210
You Red Underwear!

51
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:05,820
You! Bang Bang War?

52
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:08,690
Hey! Stop there!

53
00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:13,530
Be careful on your way. Let's wrap it.

54
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:15,120
Yes.

55
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:20,920
I, I, I... I'll... I'll help.

56
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:25,090
Actually, Geum Tae Woong, that bastard tried to kill me.

57
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:29,980
Give me a chance to take my revenge. Whether I die here or get killed by Geum Tae Woong...

58
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:36,950
Really! It's the truth, the truth.

59
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:41,730
Geum Tae Woong, that jerk. I'm really going to get him.

60
00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:44,160
You will do it? Will you be able to though?

61
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:47,300
Yes, I can!

62
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:53,280
But if I succeed, give me a portion of that 300 billion won.

63
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:56,170
Even if it's a few billion won.

64
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:09,840
Seriously. Geum Tae Woong, that jerk. I'm really going to get him.

65
00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:28,730
You. If you do something foolish, I'll send this recording to Geum Tae Woong.

66
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:46,420
Did Jo Seong Do find those guys?

67
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:49,420
He should bring something back with him this time, right?

68
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:54,400
CEO, Mr. Jo, I think he's suspicious.

69
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:57,110
I think you should  be really careful with him.

70
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:03,430
When I went to Chinatown, the prosecutors' office followed me.

71
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:07,540
If Jo Seong Do had requested his rescue with the prosecutors' office,

72
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:10,190
The prosecutors' office? Are you sure?

73
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:13,860
Watch out for Jo Seong Do.

74
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:16,260
He can betray you any time.

75
00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:21,090
There's no reason I'd be betrayed.

76
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:22,350
Yes.

77
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:26,080
Betrayal is for people who trust others.

78
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:30,840
If you don't trust anyone, there's no betrayal.

79
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:43,130
 Switch 

80
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:48,020
 Betrayal eats into the soul. 

81
00:08:55,410 --> 00:09:00,080
There's this K-Savings Bank. If CEO Geum writes up a ledger,

82
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:04,070
 we go here and there and deliver bribery. 

83
00:09:04,070 --> 00:09:05,740
I see.

84
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:22,430
I put together what Jo Seong Do told us and what we figured out.

85
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:27,520
K-Savings Bank is Choi Jeong Pil's personal safe. The bank manager Gye Choon Sik is an owner in name only.

86
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:31,040
That's where slush funds go in and out.

87
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:34,080
In and out. The place where all the money flowed in and out.

88
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:37,110
Wow. An incredible amount of money would come out if we set that place up.

89
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:39,330
 K-Savings Bank 

90
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:42,780
That was the reservoir.

91
00:09:45,130 --> 00:09:47,070
I told you to order colas.

92
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:48,860
- What is this?
 - Eat one at a time.

93
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:51,780
Pickle? Do we have a pickle?

94
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:55,180
What the heck? Who sent you here?

95
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:58,500
Which group do you belong to?

96
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,400
Super supreme?

97
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,870
I'm from the prosecutors' office.

98
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:18,180
- Hello.
 - Come and eat with us quickly.

99
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:24,250
It's strange. Even though Jo Seong Do's fingerprints were discovered,

100
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:27,520
that belt, he keeps insisting that it's not his.

101
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:30,390
Oh yeah? If he says so, then it must be the case.

102
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:32,420
He says it's not his.

103
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:34,770
Then why did you send me there?

104
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:37,930
Super Supreme?

105
00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:40,750
 Victor Jang 

106
00:10:55,330 --> 00:10:58,270
I hear you met with Governor Choi separately.

107
00:10:58,270 --> 00:11:00,650
What did he ask you to do?

108
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:03,840
That...

109
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:11,470
He told me to come up with a 100 billion won in a slush fund.

110
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:13,190
A hundred billion won?

111
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:20,520
Put it together and send it to him.

112
00:11:46,570 --> 00:11:49,480
CEO...

113
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:51,970
Did you come up with the 100 billion won?

114
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:58,570
 4783529760079817 

115
00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:02,910
Deposit that money into this account.

116
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:05,550
This is for the Governor—

117
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:07,940
If you don't listen to me,

118
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:10,400
you'll die right here.

119
00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:26,530
 Transfer to Account 4783529760079817 
 ₩ 90000000 

120
00:12:28,590 --> 00:12:29,970
 Would you like transfer? 
 OK 

121
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:39,640
 Now transferring 

122
00:12:48,450 --> 00:12:53,320
The view is wonderful.

123
00:12:56,970 --> 00:12:59,600
Spare... spare me!

124
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:04,120
CEO, please spare me!

125
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:06,370
If I gave you the money,

126
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:09,410
you said you would let me live.

127
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:13,480
When did I say that?

128
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:15,800
I don't think I made that kind of promise.

129
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:19,140
CEO! Please spare me!

130
00:13:21,530 --> 00:13:25,280
In the end, the one who knows a secret has two choices.

131
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:30,010
Either die or commit suicide.

132
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:35,140
You... you devil!

133
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:40,400
What about CCTV?

134
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:43,920
I stopped the security system.

135
00:13:56,730 --> 00:13:59,270
 I'm sorry. I apologize to my family and customers... 

136
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,010
 K-Savings Bank Manager Mr. G Commits Suicide 

137
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:28,070
 Manager Gye...  
  'K-Savings Bank Manager... commits suicide by jumping off a building over gambling debts 

138
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:30,640
Wait, is this true?

139
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:31,540
Yes.

140
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:35,110
It's breaking news everywhere.

141
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:37,350
Does this make sense?

142
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:39,750
Who the heck does he think he is to die whenever he wants to?

143
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:41,660
Oh my

144
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:50,300
And you know the bank manager's suicide case?

145
00:14:51,570 --> 00:14:53,870
Prosecutor Gil, you take it.

146
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:55,710
Yes, ma'am.

147
00:14:57,710 --> 00:15:01,100
We have his suicide note and the reason for his suicide is solid. So, tie it up with embezzlement.

148
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:02,540
Solve it quickly.

149
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:04,430
Yes, ma'am.

150
00:15:06,050 --> 00:15:11,280
Next. Cami slush funds lobby case. How is that going?

151
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,920
It's a bit weird, right?

152
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,380
What is?

153
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:19,760
She's not asking him to dig in to see if it's a suicide or not.

154
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:23,000
She concluded already that it's suicide and is directing the investigation.

155
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,280
That's right. Tying in embezzlement on top of that.

156
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:28,530
Something is definitely weird.

157
00:15:28,530 --> 00:15:30,940
The prosecutors' office is the problem.

158
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:33,370
Where are you going?

159
00:15:33,370 --> 00:15:36,500
Feel Gallery. To play Jianggi.

160
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:39,020
Why are you going there again? What if you get caught?

161
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:42,850
Keep your friends close and your enemies closer.

162
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:47,150
I don't know either.

163
00:16:01,590 --> 00:16:03,580
What is this?

164
00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:05,610
Here are Jianggi pieces.

165
00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:10,160
Your Jianggi pieces are Chinese style, so it was difficult to play.

166
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,370
Does a great calligrapher blame his brushes?

167
00:16:12,370 --> 00:16:16,000
It's not like the Jianggi rules change because you do that.

168
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,100
They say the devil is in the details.

169
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:20,700
You don't know what the variable may be.

170
00:16:23,970 --> 00:16:25,790
Now that I think of it, when you play Jianggi,

171
00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:29,230
you usually use the horseshoe strategy. 
  Jianggi strategy in which the horses are connected to form a horseshoe shape. 

172
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:31,520
You already figured out my style.

173
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:34,070
I hear people who use this horse shoe strategy often

174
00:16:34,070 --> 00:16:36,520
have a very good marriage relationship.

175
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:40,850
Talking about that, I don't think I've ever seen your wife.

176
00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:43,330
How about having a meal together someday...?

177
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:49,150
By any chance, you guys don't get along?

178
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:50,690
No.

179
00:16:50,690 --> 00:16:53,710
She passed away a long time ago.

180
00:16:53,710 --> 00:16:55,440
How?

181
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,580
It was a car accident.

182
00:16:57,580 --> 00:17:00,040
My father-in-law was an assemblyman.

183
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:02,000
She was helping him with his campaign and on her way home.

184
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,770
Ahh... That's what happened​.

185
00:17:05,770 --> 00:17:09,310
I'm sorry for needlessly bringing up your painful past.

186
00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:11,110
No, it's fine.

187
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,870
Let's start.

188
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:35,560
Hi.

189
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:36,750
Where is Sunbae Gil?

190
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:38,950
He went home saying he has an alumni gathering.

191
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:40,860
Ah. I see.

192
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:51,450
Prosecutor Gil! Where are you going?

193
00:17:51,450 --> 00:17:55,010
- An alumni gathering. 
 - What? You're not working on the bank manager case?

194
00:17:55,010 --> 00:17:57,430
It's obvious that it's suicide. What more is there to do?

195
00:17:57,430 --> 00:18:01,940
I went to the bank earlier to dig up some information. According to the bank employees, the manager isn't the type of person to gamble.

196
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:04,020
Hey, Reporter Oh.

197
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:06,270
You don't know people until you open them up.

198
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:08,300
Aren't you jumping to conclusions?

199
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:11,400
And if you have circumstantial evidence of a murder, you'll be embarrassed again.

200
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:14,870
It's a definite suicide. Do you want to bet?

201
00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:18,250
You must enjoy gambling, too, Prosecutor Gil.

202
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:35,270


203
00:18:39,850 --> 00:18:40,980
You are here, Elder.

204
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:43,010
Yes.

205
00:18:43,010 --> 00:18:45,450
He's working on the bank manager's suicide case.

206
00:18:45,450 --> 00:18:47,440
This is Prosecutor Gil Dae Ro.

207
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,980
Oh, you're working so hard.

208
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:52,510
I ask for a thorough investigation.

209
00:18:52,510 --> 00:18:54,200
Yes.

210
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:57,250
Then, I'll take my leave.

211
00:18:57,250 --> 00:18:59,280
So, how is the investigation going?

212
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:03,250
They collected the CCTV tapes from last night and they're analyzing them.

213
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:05,830
Now, let's go this way.

214
00:19:24,650 --> 00:19:28,140
You must be so sad.

215
00:19:40,510 --> 00:19:44,060
CEO Geum. I see you here again.

216
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:45,980
You must know the deceased.

217
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:49,850
Yes. He was a member of the Feel Gallery Club.

218
00:19:49,850 --> 00:19:51,850
Ah. A member.

219
00:19:51,850 --> 00:19:53,580
Prosecutor Baek, what brings you here?

220
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:56,500
As for me, my job...

221
00:19:59,290 --> 00:20:02,260
Governor Choi Jeong Pil...

222
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:05,140
It's an honor to meet you.

223
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:08,300
Who are you?

224
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:10,650
Prosecutor Baek Joon So.

225
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:17,890
You also must be a member, Governor?

226
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:32,000
There's something that bothers me. I think I should tell you.

227
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,720
Manager Gye Choon Sik. He's not someone who gambled.

228
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:42,480
If you were to lose more than 100 billion won, it's usually  spent internationally.

229
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:45,340
But there wasn't even any record of him leaving or entering the country.

230
00:20:46,150 --> 00:20:51,730
That's what I'm saying. He isn't that kind of person.

231
00:20:56,030 --> 00:21:02,360
You know how they say you have to see who benefits if you want to understand a case very well.

232
00:21:03,450 --> 00:21:06,660
You're very sharp, Prosecutor Baek.

233
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,860
A suicide note was discovered.

234
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:12,680
It's easy to fabricate a suicide note.

235
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:16,620
Prosecutor Baek, let's get together sometime.

236
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:22,650
I go crazy over people who are very intelligent and have potential.

237
00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:26,480
As expected, Governor, you know how to discern people.

238
00:21:37,870 --> 00:21:43,120
That Geum Tae Woong, how dare he lie?

239
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:47,050
Gather Namsan Club tomorrow.

240
00:21:47,770 --> 00:21:49,200
Is everything ready?

241
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:52,890
Yes, everyone is on our side except one person.

242
00:21:52,890 --> 00:21:57,080
This won't do. We'll have to move up our date.

243
00:21:57,080 --> 00:22:00,610
The old man is very quick.

244
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:08,060
Did you find out anything?

245
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:13,000
Yeah. I tested him and he totally fell for it.

246
00:22:13,910 --> 00:22:17,970
Geum Tae Woong was uncomfortable and Choi Jeong Pil fell for it.

247
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:22,230
My turn is over. Now it's your turn.

248
00:22:56,710 --> 00:22:58,200
What is this?

249
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:03,490
 Sunbae Gil, can you see me for a minute on the rooftop? 

250
00:23:04,430 --> 00:23:07,440
Did she eat something wrong from the morning?

251
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:17,390
How dare she tell a sunbae to come and go?

252
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:29,580
Good work.

253
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:34,040
Sunbae  Gil is really bothersome.

254
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:35,910
Why is he asking his hoobae to do these?

255
00:23:35,910 --> 00:23:37,380
He just went out for a bit.

256
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:38,670
That's what I'm saying.

257
00:23:38,670 --> 00:23:43,910
He's asking me to spellcheck his report. Does that make sense?

258
00:23:43,910 --> 00:23:45,650
Then, should I do it for you?

259
00:23:45,650 --> 00:23:47,520
No, no, no. It's fine.

260
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:50,520
I scored a perfect score in language.  Please go back to work.

261
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:51,980
Okay then.

262
00:23:56,210 --> 00:24:00,930
 The deceased Gye Choon Sik's fingerprints were missing from the suicide note. 

263
00:24:05,230 --> 00:24:08,490
Hey, did you send me this?

264
00:24:08,490 --> 00:24:11,660
Acting cute to your sunbae...

265
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:12,910
Why are you asking me to see you here?

266
00:24:12,910 --> 00:24:16,040
Are you doing a proper investigation on the bank manager's suicide case?

267
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:17,370
Hey, why are you meddling?

268
00:24:17,370 --> 00:24:20,790
Share your investigation. I'm curious.

269
00:24:20,790 --> 00:24:21,870
Shut up.

270
00:24:21,870 --> 00:24:27,390
I'll take care of my case. Stop fooling around as a hoobae.

271
00:24:28,430 --> 00:24:30,070
Sunbae!

272
00:24:31,230 --> 00:24:33,270
What else?

273
00:24:34,830 --> 00:24:37,990
What's worse? Fine dust or yellow dust?

274
00:24:40,550 --> 00:24:42,440
Do you want to get beat up big time?

275
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:43,490
Do you want to die?

276
00:24:43,490 --> 00:24:44,840
Are you really a prosecutor?

277
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:46,130
What do you mean now?

278
00:24:46,130 --> 00:24:49,230
Just because you pass the bar and put a prosecutor ID around your neck, does that make you a real prosecutor?

279
00:24:49,230 --> 00:24:51,210
Just because the higher-ups are telling you what to do, you're not even checking out the facts.

280
00:24:51,210 --> 00:24:53,670
You're driving this as a suicide case. Is that something a prosecutor should do?

281
00:24:53,670 --> 00:24:55,920
If you're a prosecutor, you should act like one. That's what makes you a prosecutor.

282
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:59,020
Did you eat something wrong?

283
00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:02,550
Hey, Oh Ha Ra! Really, I ...

284
00:25:02,550 --> 00:25:05,220
You're really asking for it today.

285
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:07,110
I apologize.

286
00:25:08,950 --> 00:25:11,240
I was too frank.

287
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,820
Really.

288
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:35,590
Did you find anything that made you think it could be murder?

289
00:25:35,590 --> 00:25:38,710
It says his fingerprints were not found on the suicide note.

290
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:45,980
There were no fingerprints?

291
00:25:47,370 --> 00:25:51,060
You saw the crime scene photo, right? Where was the suicide note?

292
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:55,010
Was it on the printer or on the manager's desk?

293
00:25:55,010 --> 00:25:56,950
On top of his desk.

294
00:25:56,950 --> 00:25:59,530
You said his fingerprints weren't found.

295
00:25:59,530 --> 00:26:04,180
The dead man wrote his own suicide note, printed it, and put it on his desk.

296
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:08,910
But his fingerprints weren't on that suicide note?

297
00:26:12,870 --> 00:26:16,700
Prosecutor Oh, you're a real prosecutor.

298
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:37,890
 Yeouido Church, Father Thomas. 

299
00:26:37,890 --> 00:26:40,640
 Yeouido Catholic Church 

300
00:26:56,710 --> 00:26:59,910
That con man. It was super difficult, but I found him.

301
00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:04,280
His name is Bong Man Ho. He goes by Director Bong.

302
00:27:08,110 --> 00:27:11,510
Are you saying you found him?

303
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:17,950
Take this to Geum Tae Woong.

304
00:27:17,950 --> 00:27:20,510
 Really? I can do that? 

305
00:27:20,510 --> 00:27:24,300
You have to look capable so that he'll continue to use you.

306
00:27:25,670 --> 00:27:27,480
When did you find him?

307
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:30,990
When we were going around together, we couldn't even trace his tail.

308
00:27:30,990 --> 00:27:34,350
Director Kim, are you being jealous mow because I got a job done?

309
00:27:34,350 --> 00:27:37,260
You're pettier than I thought.

310
00:27:37,910 --> 00:27:42,180
Is there a connection between the  con artist and Prosecutor Baek Joon Soo?

311
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:46,810
I didn't find anything about that yet...

312
00:27:47,970 --> 00:27:50,510
Find me proof that they are in this together.

313
00:27:50,510 --> 00:27:54,080
Even if we catch him now, we won't get anything out of him if he denies.

314
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:57,460
Yes! Please trust in me.

315
00:28:07,190 --> 00:28:11,420
Yes, it was great during that time.

316
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:20,020
If anyone said he came from Namsan, everyone including conglomerates and politicians, everyone was so scared.

317
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:28,560
There are hundreds, thousands of people that our Namsan Club controls.

318
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:33,720
This is the shadow government that moves Korea.

319
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:45,510
The world doesn't change just because you want to change. You have to make your move carefully from behind-the-scenes.

320
00:28:45,510 --> 00:28:46,870
Understand?

321
00:28:46,870 --> 00:28:52,810
