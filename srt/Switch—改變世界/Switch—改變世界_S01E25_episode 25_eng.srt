1
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:49,810
Father! Father!
  Episode 25 

2
00:00:49,810 --> 00:00:54,310
Father. Pull yourself together! I said pull yourself together!

3
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:56,300
Do Chan.

4
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:04,040
I get to call my son's name before I die.

5
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:09,750
What are you talking about? Who's dying? Get up!

6
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:15,460
You brat. Your heart beats fast as it always has.

7
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:21,010
A scammer's heart should beat slowly.

8
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:30,550
The biggest con in the world is to

9
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:37,480
win one person's heart completely.

10
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:43,400
Please, just like that,

11
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:48,330
live a normal life while having a fun with a girl.

12
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:50,810
Son.

13
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:54,440
I'm sorry.

14
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:15,540
Father. Father.

15
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:18,520
Father!

16
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,390
Father.

17
00:02:55,720 --> 00:03:01,100
Sa Do Chan. What? Do you come here for, revenge?

18
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:03,410
You devil bastard!

19
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:08,210
So? Are you going to kill me?

20
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:11,830
I was getting along with your father at first

21
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:16,130
as an ambitious detective and a splendid scammer.

22
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:22,010
We conned here and there to achieve everything we wanted.

23
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:27,900
But he began to block my path at some point and started to bother me.

24
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,590
So I got rid of him.

25
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:37,330
Why? Do I need to explain more?

26
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:43,510
I won't forgive you forever.

27
00:03:54,490 --> 00:03:59,230
I will return you your father's fake hand.

28
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:05,970
Why?

29
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:09,770
Your heart can't beat slowly anymore?

30
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:14,480
That's what your father Sa Ma Cheon used to say all the time.

31
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:19,760
"A scammer's heart beats slowly."

32
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:23,590
Do you want to kill me?

33
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:28,550
Does your heart feel like exploding out of anger?

34
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:32,900
Do you want to get revenge on me for your father?

35
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:56,810
Sa, Sa Do Chan.

36
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:02,800
You...

37
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:09,770
CEO.

38
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:19,250


39
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:36,390
Sa Do Chan.  Stop there. Run slowly.

40
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:38,150
Sa Do Chan.

41
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:49,050
 Switch 

42
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:52,390
 Anger makes your heart beat faster. 

43
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,820
Give out all the information on the case to reporters.

44
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:15,140
Saying that Victor Jang and Sa Ma Cheon beat each other to death after their scams were revealed.

45
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:21,220
And scammer Sa Do Chan misunderstood me and assaulted me last night.

46
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:24,700
He tried to kill me but ran away.

47
00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:28,310
It's an attempted murder.

48
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:31,880
You must tell the reporters to write the article.

49
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:34,220
Okay. Understood.

50
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:43,470
 Two male bodies which were discovered at the warehouse by the port yesterday afternoon 

51
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:46,240
 turned out to be fraud suspects. 

52
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:50,420
 They were scamming by means of a Turkistan natural gas project. 

53
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:54,210
 They are assumed to have killed each other while fighting over profit division.
Breaking News: Two bodies from the warehouse at the port were identified. 

54
00:06:54,210 --> 00:06:57,730
 Especially, one of the scammers fled after their scam was exposed 

55
00:06:57,730 --> 00:07:00,380
 and raided Feel Gallery CEO Geum last night.
Scammer Mr. Sa assaulted Feel Gallery CEO Geum, even pretended to be a prosecutor 

56
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:04,620
 The victim is currently beleived to be in a serious condition. 

57
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:07,160
Did Sa Do Chan really do this?

58
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:10,220
I heard that they even obtained Sa Do Chan's fingerprints at the scene.

59
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:12,510
This is driving me crazy.

60
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:15,930
Hey, how about Geum Tae Woong? How is he?

61
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:19,800
I heard that he is still in a coma. He seems to be in a serious condition because he lost a lot of blood.

62
00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:27,160
 Police are chasing after Scammer Mr. Sa as a prime suspect. 

63
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:32,030
 Given that Mr. Sa approached the investors, taking advantage of his resemblance to Prosecutor Baek, 

64
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:35,770
 he is charged with impersonation of a public official. Police are diligently attempting to apprehend him. 

65
00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:40,940
He's so gutsy. How dare he pretend to be a prosecutor?

66
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:46,470
Wait. Now that I look carefully, he really looks like him.

67
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:48,890
 All right. I won't date. Satisfied? 

68
00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:52,260
 Did I say not to date anyone? I said not to see Prosecutor Baek. 

69
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:54,050
 With that con artist? 

70
00:07:55,180 --> 00:08:01,570
By chance, did she mean it when she said con artist?

71
00:08:01,570 --> 00:08:04,360
Wow, they do really look alike.

72
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:08,490
There's no way he came all the way into the prosecutors' office and scammed us. Could he have?

73
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:13,760
Geez, no way, unless he tried to win women at a nightclub acting like a prosecutor.

74
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:17,090
How could he come all the way to the prosecutors' office on his own?

75
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:21,060
Never mind other people. He can never fool my eyes.

76
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:25,760
I guess. There's no way a con artist would come up with investigative knowledge so fast.

77
00:08:27,970 --> 00:08:29,500
Yes.

78
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:33,040
Yes, I understand.

79
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:39,070
You saw the news, right? The murder incident at Incheon port.

80
00:08:39,070 --> 00:08:42,570
Yes. I heard CEO Geum almost fell for a con.

81
00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:47,330
The problem is the con artist who attacked CEO Geum and ran away.

82
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:51,590
He pretended to be a prosecutor.

83
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:58,850
Isn't this Prosecutor Baek Joon Soo?

84
00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:02,510
The Baek Joon Soo you've been seeing all this time could've been him.

85
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:04,440
Sa Do Chan.

86
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:08,790
Prosecutors Yang Ji Seung and Oh Ha Ra. From what point, were they deceived?

87
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:13,010
Were they perhaps accomplices? Find out all that in detail.

88
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:15,870
Okay. I'll look into it thoroughly.

89
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:26,020
Prosecutor Oh. This is war.

90
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:30,710
For now, stand your ground. That's the only way we can have a chance to fight.

91
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:36,840
You and I. No... At the least, you didn't know anything. Got it?

92
00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:42,430
Now that the things have come to this far, I don't know if that would work.

93
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:48,650
If Sa Do Chan was a con artist, did she know about it?

94
00:09:48,650 --> 00:09:52,580
No way. Could a prosecutor have been playing around with a con artist?

95
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:55,210
See? She goes around as if nothing's happened.

96
00:09:55,210 --> 00:09:56,850
So brazen.

97
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:06,100
Hey, Oh Ha Ra. You really didn't know? Didn't you pretend not to know while you were plotting with the con artist?

98
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:10,420
Even an elite like you, Sunbae, whenever there are new cases,

99
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:12,980
there are so many things you don't know, right?

100
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:18,500
For someone who's not a prosecutor, he writes out an indictment right away without help from his superior, arresting drug smugglers.

101
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:21,130
Do you think that makes sense?

102
00:10:21,130 --> 00:10:25,810
I've been working with Prosecutor Baek Joon Soo all this time.

103
00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:29,290
Fine. Let's say what you say is correct.

104
00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:36,370
Then, where is the real Baek Joon Soo right now?

105
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:43,390
Did you know there was a con artist pretending to be you?

106
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:45,240
Could you say one word about how you feel?

107
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:48,300
One word please!

108
00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:53,490
Your valve stenosis is serious! You can't move!

109
00:10:53,490 --> 00:10:58,890
Whether it's morphine or defibrillation, I don't care.

110
00:10:58,890 --> 00:11:03,280
Please help me to work once more for this case.

111
00:11:14,330 --> 00:11:20,250
How much did you know, Prosecutor Baek? Did you possibly know he came all the way to the prosecutors' office?

112
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:21,830
I have never...

113
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:24,550
I've never left the prosecutors' office.

114
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:31,240
This guy, Sa Do Chan, I guess he knew he looks like me, so he must've been going around pretending to be me.

115
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:35,450
Since he's suspected of attempted murder, I'll make sure I catch him myself.

116
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:38,140
For my reputation.

117
00:11:41,090 --> 00:11:45,630
Sunbae, what are you going to do? Are you really going to arrest him?

118
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:50,790
If he gets arrested for impersonating a public official and for attempted murder, he'll receive a heavy punishment.

119
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:55,770
So, he shouldn't have made the mistake. Now, we're all at risk.

120
00:11:55,770 --> 00:12:00,450
Sunbae, must you be so cold in a situation like this?

121
00:12:00,450 --> 00:12:04,040
Sa Do Chan. His father died right in front of his eyes.

122
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:09,120
Geum Tae Woong killed his father right in front of his eyes, yet he couldn't do anything.

123
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:15,270
That's why I came out. I want to clean up what Sa Do Chan did.

124
00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:19,590
If I don't stop this now, we won't be able to handle it later.

125
00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:23,990
I'm also worried that Sa Do Chan will slip up more.

126
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:27,240
I have to try to stop him from going over the edge, but I can't contact him.

127
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:33,440
Sa Do Chan, he'll be in danger if we leave him alone this way.

128
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:48,370
 Suspect for Murder Wanted
 Bounty Maximum Ten Million Won 

129
00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:51,610
 Sa Do Chan 

130
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:30,650
 Until I say, "I can't find you, where are you?" 

131
00:13:30,650 --> 00:13:34,470
 Be sure you hide well. You can't come out, okay? 

132
00:13:37,370 --> 00:13:41,600
 - Even though my hand looks like this, I have a big hand. 
 - A big hand? 

133
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:45,640
 Yes, of course. I can catch Brown Bear with this hand. 

134
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:49,680
 With this one hand, I can protect you, Prosecutor. 

135
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,610
 Son... 

136
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:01,180
 I'm sorry. 

137
00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:18,080
Oh, okay. Thanks.

138
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:25,430
Geum Tae Woong is conscious. Aigoo, I'm so glad he didn't die. Aigoo.

139
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:50,470
I'm from the Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office.

140
00:15:02,170 --> 00:15:04,950
You look healthier than I thought.

141
00:15:15,070 --> 00:15:20,540
Should I reveal your shoulder or something? There's no way Sa Do Chan is in front of my eyes, is there?

142
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:26,860
He's already on the Wanted List. I'll catch Sa Do Chan with my own hands.

143
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:28,770
Of course, you should.

144
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:34,100
First, catch Sa Do Chan and bring him to me.

145
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:38,150
Sa Do Chan, Oh Ha Ra, Prosecutor Baek.

146
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:43,550
For the crime of mocking me, Geum Tae Woong, the three of you together.

147
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:47,290
I'll pay you back according to your part.

148
00:15:47,290 --> 00:15:52,410
When I catch Sa Do Chan, I'll ask you for the weight of your crime as well.

149
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:57,780
I'll be sure to stand you at trial.

150
00:15:59,110 --> 00:16:00,250
Go ahead.

151
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:05,260
You will meet a  miserable end.

152
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:07,910
You can imagine to your heart's content.

153
00:16:10,990 --> 00:16:17,350
Oh, yeah. You should put a bodyguard around Prosecutor Oh Ha Ra.

154
00:16:19,570 --> 00:16:25,070
I feel nervous that a woman would walk home alone at night.

155
00:16:25,070 --> 00:16:27,190
Geum Tae Woong.

156
00:16:27,190 --> 00:16:30,970
Are you saying you're going to hurt Prosecutor Oh Ha Ra or something?

157
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:35,040
I'm showing my concern for her.

158
00:16:56,230 --> 00:16:58,920
Where will you use this?

159
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:02,420
This is the method often used by con artists.

160
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:06,850
Sa Do Chan will come by the gallery soon.

161
00:17:06,850 --> 00:17:10,300
Move out all the security guards and let me come in.

162
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:12,260
Are you saying you're setting a trap?

163
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:16,380
It's a method I used to use a lot while I was a detective,

164
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:18,740
when a person is put on the spot.

165
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:25,010
If you use it especially when one is in a state of rage, it works well.

166
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,340
 Are you going to get revenge on me for your father? 

167
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:58,470
Geum Tae Woong is fine? Are you saying he put on an act?

168
00:17:58,470 --> 00:18:03,350
It's a relief. It means Sa Do Chan didn't make a huge mistake.

169
00:18:04,930 --> 00:18:07,380
What's different though?

170
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:13,110
Sa Do Chan is on the run as a murder suspect. The warrant for his arrest is out already.

171
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:20,760
Geum Tae Woong is the one who killed Sa Ma Cheon. That's the fact.

172
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:24,330
I have to arrest Geum Tae Woong.

173
00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:27,060
With what evidence? You don't even have a warrant.

174
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:32,470
I also want to arrest him right this minute. But we don't have evidence.

175
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:37,130
Calm down and obtain evidence according to the law. Arrest him solidly.

176
00:18:37,130 --> 00:18:39,650
So, we're supposed to leave him alone?

177
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:42,500
I can't do that.

178
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:21,750
Geum Tae Woong, you're perfectly well.

179
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,260
Prosecutor Baek was here earlier.

180
00:19:29,130 --> 00:19:31,470
I'm Prosecutor Oh Ha Ra.

181
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:38,100
From now on, don't come unless you have a search warrant or an arrest warrant when you come to see me.

182
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:42,760
When I see you, I get very sick to my stomach, Prosecutor Oh.

183
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:47,220
Geum Tae Woong, you're under immediate arrest for the murder of Sa Ma Cheon.

184
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:48,470
Immediate arrest?

185
00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:52,970
You can hire an attorney and file a petition for your release if your arrest is illegal.

186
00:19:52,970 --> 00:19:56,730
If you have something to say, please do so.

187
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:10,070
Let's go. I can go with you.

188
00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:15,610
But if you can't provide real evidence, I'll make sure you regret this.

189
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:25,580
What is the reason he was placed under immediate arrest?

190
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:28,650
- CEO Kim, do you have anything to say? 
 - Please say something!

191
00:20:28,650 --> 00:20:32,120
You act exactly like those slippery loaches (which avoid legal punishment by all means).

192
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:37,620
Geum Tae Woong is a victim. What is the reason for bringing in the victim?

193
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:43,420
- One word please! 
 - Say something!

194
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:47,090
CEO Geum, are you going in without saying anything?

195
00:20:47,090 --> 00:20:51,810
How can you arrest the victim all of a sudden? You think an immediate arrest is a cure-all?

196
00:20:51,810 --> 00:20:55,810
It's highly probable that he's connected to Sa Ma Cheon and Victor's case.

197
00:20:55,810 --> 00:21:00,350
He was actually at the crime scene. He must be interrogated at least once.

198
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:05,820
Don't you know it's humiliating for the prosecutors' office if you can't indict him within 48 hours? Will you be responsible for that?

199
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:11,500
For now, please trust Prosecutor Oh Ha Ra. We'll do our best.

200
00:21:14,550 --> 00:21:20,450
 Feel Gallery CEO Geum who was known to be a victim of Turkistan natural gas case was summoned to the prosecutors' office today. 

201
00:21:20,450 --> 00:21:27,460
 Even though his life won't be threatened, this is still drawing attention as to why he had to be arrested without a warrant.  

202
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:32,850
 Geum Tae Woong is alive? 

203
00:21:40,650 --> 00:21:44,000
 We'll have to use a weaker explosive. 

204
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,870
 I almost died. 

205
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:55,540
 Geum Tae Woong set me up? He faked his own death, huh? 

206
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:58,970
 I'm grateful that he's alive. 

207
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:15,580
That's a relief. Hey, Geum Tae Woong isn't dead.

208
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:17,350
Right, our Oppa Do Chan ...

209
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:20,420
There's no way he would've killed a man out of anger.

210
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:23,980
At a glance, you can tell this is a victim cosplay.

211
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:28,290
I thought Do Chan was becoming a murderer. I was so shocked.

212
00:22:28,290 --> 00:22:31,500
Hyung, don't you think this was Geum Tae Woong's setting?

213
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:36,700
Then, he's extraordinary. He's smart and evil.

214
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:41,230
That bastard got Do Chan twice.

215
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:47,860
The contract we found at the crime scene.

216
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:51,580
Your name. You see that, right?

217
00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:57,520
This is your car that was photographed at that time near the location.

218
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:00,250
And you say you're not connected?

219
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:05,510
Geum Tae Woong.

220
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:10,380
My legal team will be here soon.

221
00:23:12,870 --> 00:23:15,820
Talk with them please.

222
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:40,460
As you can see, I have no strength to testify. I've been seriously injured.

223
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:44,540
Bringing in a critical patient to conduct a coercive investigation. How can you do this?

224
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:49,980
This is proof that Victor Jang and Sa Ma Cheon entered the country illegally with fake IDs.

225
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:55,360
The con artists fought and killed each other at the crime scene when the scam didn't pan out as planned.

226
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:58,400
Mr. Geum Tae Woong's signature isn't there on the line.

227
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:03,860
Geum Tae Woong left the meeting when he found out the contract was a fraud.

228
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:08,970
No, you had no intention of signing the contract to begin with.

229
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:14,170
We carefully monitored your cash flow through the FIU. 
  FIU: Financial Intelligence Unit 

230
00:24:14,170 --> 00:24:20,830
You actually sold your real estate including your buildings and stocks in order to deceive the con artists.

231
00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:25,100
But you didn't convert  the proceeds into bearer bonds.

232
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:31,880
You had transferred all that money you gathered into a secret account in Liechtenstein.

233
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:34,520
The account holder is Simon Jo.

234
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:43,250
You went there without an intent to sign the contract. That means you had another goal.

235
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:47,060
To get rid of the con artists.

236
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:08,020
Chief Prosecutor, Prosecutor Oh is cornering him too much.

237
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:10,050
No, she's not. I'm sure he's connected.

238
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:14,460
You have evidence? Both of the con artists died.

239
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:19,670
We don't have a case. So wrap it up and release Geum Tae Woong.

240
00:25:19,670 --> 00:25:21,090
Yes, ma'am.

241
00:25:22,790 --> 00:25:24,400
Chief Prosecutor, please—

242
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,650
Leave quietly.

243
00:25:28,250 --> 00:25:30,010
Okay.

244
00:25:38,410 --> 00:25:41,520
Geum Tae Woong, you can leave.

245
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:43,630
Sunbae Gil.

246
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:49,300
It's Chief Prosecutor's order. What are you doing without any evidence?

247
00:25:50,730 --> 00:25:52,630
Let's go.

248
00:25:58,380 --> 00:26:00,550
Geum Tae Woong.

249
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:07,430
I'll bring you back here someday.

250
00:26:11,870 --> 00:26:14,290
As you wish.

251
00:26:58,710 --> 00:27:01,480
I'm glad you came out without a huge issue.

252
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:06,920
I was dragged to the prosecutors' office and you say you're glad?

253
00:27:08,210 --> 00:27:11,060
Prosecutor Oh, I can't leave her alone.

254
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:12,320
What should I do?

255
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:16,190
First of all, we have to catch Sa Do Chan.

256
00:27:16,930 --> 00:27:21,910
Then, the fact that they were part of the con will be revealed.

257
00:27:21,910 --> 00:27:26,020
For both of them, their careers as prosecutors are over.

258
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:28,200
Then...

259
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:30,680
Keep an eye on Prosecutor Oh Ha Ra's surroundings.

260
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:36,730
I'm sure she'll go near that Sa Do Chan. Bring her to me then.

261
00:27:36,730 --> 00:27:38,690
I understand.

262
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:53,300
Unni, you're not connected to this incident, right?

263
00:27:54,270 --> 00:27:55,910
Let's talk later.

264
00:27:55,910 --> 00:28:00,970
Unni, you said that Prosecutor Baek was undercover when he was pretending to be a doctor that time.

265
00:28:01,830 --> 00:28:04,860
By chance, was that doctor a con artist?

266
00:28:27,490 --> 00:28:30,900
I guess this is what people mean when they say the world is a small place.

267
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:37,960
When you asked me to find Sa Do Chan who resembles Prosecutor Baek Joon Soo, I had no idea it would become this big.

268
00:28:38,710 --> 00:28:45,210
The popcorn man— I mean, how long did Sa Ma Cheon know about Sa Do Chan's whereabouts?

269
00:28:45,210 --> 00:28:49,000
I've known Sa Ma Cheon for a long time.

270
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:52,900
I told him about him when Sa Do Chan started going into the prosecutors' office.

271
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:57,330
And the people who rescued Sa Do Chan when he was in trouble while digging into the  Hongdae drug incident...

272
00:28:57,330 --> 00:28:59,490
He and I were the ones.

273
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:03,130
That's what happened.

274
00:29:03,130 --> 00:29:06,010
I was always curious about that.

275
00:29:06,010 --> 00:29:08,950
People's relationship links are so mysterious.

276
00:29:08,950 --> 00:29:11,320
I'll pour you a glass.

277
00:29:16,690 --> 00:29:18,400
As for Sa Ma Cheon,

278
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:23,300
why couldn't he show himself to Sa Do Chan when he knew he was his son?

279
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:30,030
He said he was ashamed.

280
00:29:31,010 --> 00:29:34,200
That he was too ashamed to show himself to his son.

281
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:41,650
That Terracotta Warrior incident, Elder Sa Ma Cheon planned that to catch Geum Tae Woong.

282
00:29:41,650 --> 00:29:44,250
It was ruined because of Chief Prosecutor Jeong Do Yeong.

283
00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:48,680
Sa Do Chan had to give up on taking the bar because of that incident.

284
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:51,480
Sa Do Chan was preparing to take the bar?

285
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:53,990
You didn't know?

286
00:29:53,990 --> 00:29:59,930
If it wasn't for that incident, Sa Do Chan would've become a prosecutor by now.

287
00:29:59,930 --> 00:30:04,540
Elder blamed himself a lot for this.

288
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:12,580
He said he's a father who ruined his son's life. He said he'd be able to face his son better if he took his revenge on Geum Tae Woong.

289
00:30:14,590 --> 00:30:22,650
I will work hard, including Sa Do Chan's portion. I will destroy Geum Tae Woong for sure.

290
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,200
 Sunbae! 

291
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:58,770
 I need this man for sure. 

292
00:30:58,770 --> 00:31:01,020
 I'm truly grateful. 

293
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:03,720
 What about? 

294
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:08,130
 I'm saying I'm grateful that you got prettier while I haven't seen you. 

295
00:31:08,130 --> 00:31:10,220
 Sunbae... 

296
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:18,780
♫  Close your eyes and in your warmth wait and sleep on&nbsp;  ♫

297
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:23,710
 Prosecutor Oh. 

298
00:31:23,710 --> 00:31:26,880
 I told you not to look at me so longingly. 

299
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:33,190
 I'm warning you. Don't try to get to know me too much. 

300
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:38,300
 Father! 

301
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:39,140
 Father! 

302
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:43,660
♫  Raise me up stay there for me  ♫

303
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:48,080
♫  Raise me up though far away&nbsp;  ♫

304
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:52,730
♫  Stay with me  ♫

305
00:31:52,730 --> 00:31:54,590
♫  At my side  ♫

306
00:31:54,590 --> 00:31:57,050
