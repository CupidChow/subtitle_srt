1
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:31,910
This is Shin Jang Hoon. Prosecutor Baek Joon Soo's high school classmate.

2
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:38,700
But Prosecutor Baek, you didn't even glance at him and walked right past him when you came in earlier,

3
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:43,910
even though someone who is not a prosecutor showed up to a gathering of prosecutors.

4
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,440
Joon Soo, don't you know me?

5
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:53,130
Sorry.

6
00:01:54,290 --> 00:01:58,350
It's because I'm at a work gathering. I guess you must've been extremely disappointed.

7
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:00,610
I expected that level of excuse.

8
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:04,840
Gil Sunbae, isn't this too much? Especially with the chief prosecutor with us.

9
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:07,350
You're crossing the line with your joke.

10
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:11,340
Whether I'm joking or not, we should check.

11
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:15,400
According to him, back in high school with Prosecutor Baek,

12
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:20,100
they were playing with fire in an abandoned house and both of them got burned. Right?

13
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:22,070
Yes.

14
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:26,400
Here.

15
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:36,290
How about it, Prosecutor Baek? Can you show us your burn scar?

16
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:43,990
Prosecutor Gil, what are you going to do about ruining the mood here, huh?

17
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:45,870
Prosecutor Yang, just a minute.

18
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:54,310
Is this my birthday surprise? It's interesting. Continue.

19
00:02:57,170 --> 00:03:01,040
Prosecutor Baek, let's see. Is it over here?

20
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:08,480
You can't show it to us? Why not?

21
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,960
Because you're fake!

22
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:14,290
What happened?

23
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:17,950
If you're not Prosecutor Baek Joon Soo, who exactly are you?

24
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:21,210
A criminal offense, pretending to be a civil servant.

25
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:27,270
If people who cooperated in this fraud are present here, you're aware that you're accomplices, right?

26
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:32,500
Um, that's actually... well...

27
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:37,020
- I said stop!
 - If he's real, he just has to show us.

28
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:45,210
If you're sure, show us. Why? You scared?

29
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:53,620
Everyone, did you see that? He's fake.

30
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:55,830
Sunbae, stop it now.

31
00:03:55,830 --> 00:04:01,550
What sunbae? You're fake. If you're real, prove it.

32
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:07,820
Joon Soo has a burn scar on the back of his left shoulder.

33
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:10,080
In a lightning shape.

34
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:19,800
Prosecutor Baek, I think it'd be better if you just show it if you want to clear everyone's suspicion.

35
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:31,480
If you're curious, please excuse me.

36
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:07,670


37
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:10,290
 Controlled Area 

38
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:14,820
Let's go.

39
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:21,420
How is that...

40
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:30,220
January 14, 2004, Thursday at 2 pm. The location was a barn in Haedongsan.

41
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:34,510
Jang Hoon, we started the fire trying to bake the potatoes you brought from home and that's how the fire started.

42
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:38,350
We were trying to put the fire out and we were burned.

43
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:42,520
And right before that, you went on a blind date with a girl, a senior at Daesung Girls High School.

44
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:46,640
You bragged about how pretty she was and asked me to write a love letter in your place.

45
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:52,530
Joon Soo. We were the only ones who went inside that barn.

46
00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:56,130
There's no way he'd know these things unless he's Joon Soo.

47
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,800
He's Baek Joon Soo.

48
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:06,380
Oh, you! That burn scar... Hey, you!

49
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:09,720
Did you eat something wrong?

50
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:17,470
Who the heck are you, huh? Sit down, man! Geez. That troublemaker.

51
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:20,680
- Geez, he almost had me. 
 - Prosecutor Gil,

52
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:24,710
I commend you for your efforts, but that was too much.

53
00:06:25,450 --> 00:06:28,140
Apologize to Prosecutor Baek.

54
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:55,390
We're here to take you, Prosecutor Baek.

55
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:02,380
What? Why isn't he here? Huh?

56
00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:14,970
- Where are we going for our second round?
 - Chief Prosecutor, we're going to a karaoke bar in Gangnam.

57
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:21,850
Please get in.

58
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:36,330
 CEO. He's not here. 

59
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:41,370
- What do you mean he's not there? 
 - Baek Joon Soo isn't here.

60
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:15,900
You're amazing. How did you know Sunbae had a burn scarn on his shoulder? I didn't know that either.

61
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:19,610
Wait. Isn't it natural that I don't know about it?

62
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:22,580
In any case, you're a genius! A genius!

63
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:26,270
I was so nervous that I thought I was going to die.

64
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:32,470
Ahh. I thought Oh Ha Ra's life as a prosecutor was over at that point.

65
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:35,460
Prosecutor Oh.

66
00:08:36,310 --> 00:08:40,690
Why did you do something like this knowing how dangerous it is? How are you going to take care of this?

67
00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:44,470
That's not it. The one who caused all this is Sunbae Gil.

68
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:48,160
As for taking care of everything, you did it, Con Artist.

69
00:09:11,530 --> 00:09:13,490
No way...

70
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:20,170
You must've broken that woman ( Lady Justice )  in the end,

71
00:09:20,170 --> 00:09:22,550
seeing only the scale is there.

72
00:09:23,450 --> 00:09:25,670
 Are you going to take the lady with you? 

73
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:28,860
 I'm just concerned that you might break it taking her with you. 

74
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:33,150
 I'll give it back to you when you come back to Seoul. 

75
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:35,430
 Don't you break it. 

76
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,180
Sunbae...

77
00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:43,030
How could you have come here... I mean, how...

78
00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:46,420
Is my position still available?

79
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:49,970
- What are you saying? 
 - You said so.

80
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:52,980
When I come back, there might not be a position for me.

81
00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:56,590
  I'm going to keep working with him. 

82
00:09:56,590 --> 00:10:01,530
 You might not have a position to return to. So... 

83
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:05,170
 Wake up soon. 

84
00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:13,500
Surprise!

85
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:19,170
Ah, Prosecutor Baek, you're great at acting. Scamming is all about timing.

86
00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:23,660
- Then, did you plan this together... 
 - Surprised?

87
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:27,550
Do you call this a reversal of a reversal?

88
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,480
Thanks for coming back, Sunbae.

89
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:09,210
Sunbae!

90
00:11:16,990 --> 00:11:19,710
 Switch 

91
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:23,820
 04
 You can't shake  hands using a fist 

92
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:31,130
Is that right? So, was there a burn scar?

93
00:11:31,130 --> 00:11:34,900
Yes, it was clearly there.

94
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:40,300
He even testified to the facts that are known only to the real Baek Joon Soo.

95
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:43,930
Baek Joon Soo. He's real.

96
00:11:56,230 --> 00:12:00,360
Daebak. He looks just like Oppa.

97
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:04,160
He's exactly the same. Aren't they twins?

98
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:08,600
But, it's not right to bring him here though.

99
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:09,840
To live with a prosecutor?

100
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:13,900
He rescued our Do Chan.

101
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:16,410
Let's just bear it for now.

102
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:21,260
Hey! How can you touch the prosecutor's face?

103
00:12:23,490 --> 00:12:24,860
Hey!

104
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:31,750
Did you know Gil Dae Ro would be testing you?

105
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:34,560
Someone in a specialized profession like me

106
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:37,450
is always prepared for what ifs.

107
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:40,950
What did Gil Dae Ro do?

108
00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:43,680
He was making a scene at the General Affairs Division.

109
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:46,550
 I said I'm asking you for a favor!  A favor! 

110
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:52,630
 To find out what it was all about, I had to coax the general affairs employee. 

111
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:55,230
 What did Prosecutor Gil just ask you to do? 

112
00:12:55,230 --> 00:12:59,460
 Actually... he wanted your personnel information. 

113
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:03,050
Gil Dae Ro wanted my... I mean...

114
00:13:03,050 --> 00:13:06,650
He took Baek Joon Soo's personnel information.

115
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:12,070
So, I dispatched my team members.

116
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:19,880
How about Sunbae Baek?

117
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:22,410
Prosecutor Baek was in danger.

118
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:28,160
 Excuse me. I'm the one who called you. 

119
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,380
 Ah, yes, nice to meet you. 

120
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:33,460
 You know Baek Joon Soo, right? The one who fell into the ocean. 

121
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:34,720
 I... I don't know. 

122
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:38,680
 I'm sure the bastards were trying to figure out where Prosecutor Baek went after the accident. 

123
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:43,440
 In the end, I'm sure they found the ambulance driver. 

124
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:47,760
 I asked him to give me a call right away as soon as someone looking for Prosecutor Baek showed up. 

125
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:52,110
Fortunately, Prosecutor Baek woke up while we were bringing him.

126
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:54,700
And we described the situation to him on our way over.

127
00:13:55,920 --> 00:14:00,850
Prosecutor Baek and I  ultimately rescued each other.

128
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:04,010
So ironic.

129
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:09,020
Anyway, you're amazing.

130
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:16,040
I can't say with my own lips that I'm a perfectionist in everything I do and that is my charm.

131
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:23,270
But you couldn't have predicted that Prosecutor Baek would wake up at that moment in time.

132
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:27,420
When it comes to setting things up, it's made up of 99% detailed plan

133
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:31,180
and a little bit of luck should come along.

134
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:34,840
About one spoonful?

135
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,590
Excuse me, Prosecutor.

136
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:52,410
That man, how long is he going to be here?

137
00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:57,070
Hey, you. We're not filming "Sleeping with the Enemy."

138
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,990
It's uncomfortable.

139
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:01,930
I'm sorry, but for now—

140
00:15:01,930 --> 00:15:04,120
What is so uncomfortable?

141
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:07,930
Hey, don't be scared. People who committed crimes are the ones who get scared in front of prosecutors.

142
00:15:07,930 --> 00:15:10,110
Did we commit any crime?

143
00:15:11,090 --> 00:15:13,280
What do you mean you didn't commit any crime?

144
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:19,370
Criminal Act Article 118.

145
00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:21,900
False Impersonation of  a public official.

146
00:15:28,530 --> 00:15:30,640
He wasn't at the hospital?

147
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:34,620
He was discharged a few days ago. But his name wasn't Baek Joon Soo.

148
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:36,430
Was it Hwang Dong Chan or something?

149
00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:39,200
So, Prosecutor Baek never went there to begin with.

150
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,690
There's no way.

151
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:42,910
The person who was in Sokcho is Prosecutor Baek Joon Soo.

152
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:45,330
That doesn't make sense logically.

153
00:15:45,330 --> 00:15:47,730
Director Kim, you ran over some innocent guy with your truck.

154
00:15:47,730 --> 00:15:52,350
How can you kill an innocent life? You cruel bastard. Don't you think so, CEO?

155
00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:56,140
Baek Joon Soo, he's quite a headache in so many ways.

156
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:59,020
Why would he be a headache? I'll get rid of him once and for all.

157
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:03,700
Whether he's real or fake, he's interfering with our work. Isn't that right, CEO?

158
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:06,560
Don't you ever touch Prosecutor Baek.

159
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:14,620
Don't you think I know that?

160
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:18,360
You were in a coma and Nam Seung Tae refused to meet anyone but you.

161
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:20,810
I was so desperate.

162
00:16:20,810 --> 00:16:22,870
Do you know how desperate I was to do that?

163
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:26,300
It doesn't matter. In front of the law, Sa Do Chan is...

164
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:28,230
He  impersonated a public official which is illegal.

165
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:30,280
And you ordered him to, Prosecutor Oh.

166
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:33,910
It'll mean at least three years of imprisonment or a fine of 7 million won.

167
00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:40,820
And there's another accomplice.

168
00:16:43,890 --> 00:16:45,700
None other than me.

169
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:51,600
I was part of that act.

170
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,300
- Sunbae. 
 - I also

171
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:56,830
will pay for my crime according to the law.

172
00:16:57,430 --> 00:17:02,670
Yes, yes. I understand full well what you're saying, the upright  prosecutor.

173
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:07,220
As expected, a real prosecutor is different. You cut to the chase.

174
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:08,860
Not you, too...

175
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:13,700
The real actor is back, so we'll end the roleplay here.

176
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:16,340
I'll step down from the stage.

177
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:21,330
Ah. I'm fine with you indicting me and whatnot,

178
00:17:21,330 --> 00:17:24,150
but let's consider extenuation for my team members.

179
00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:28,430
They're only guilty of being dragged into your games, Prosecutors.

180
00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:32,800
Hey...

181
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:40,650
 Timing and

182
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:47,860
What? An indictment?

183
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:50,270
- Yes... 
 - Wow, this is crazy.

184
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:53,430
Hey, that Joon Soo. He does what he says he'll do.

185
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:56,310
Hey, hey. There's a reason why his name is Joon Soo (means "conform" in Korean.)

186
00:17:56,310 --> 00:18:00,360
You know why his name is Joon Soo? It's because he conforms to the law! That's why his name is Joon Soo.

187
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:02,130
That's why I'm worried.

188
00:18:02,130 --> 00:18:05,270
Unlike anyone else, I know Sunbae's personality.

189
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:08,660
This is crazy. What should we do?

190
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:17,100
- Prosecutor Gil, I enjoyed your show last night. 
 - I enjoyed it.

191
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:21,100
"A commotion that occurred on the night of the Chief Prosecutor's birthday party."

192
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,690
What? Did the article get published already?

193
00:18:22,690 --> 00:18:27,320
No. I worked on the headline. What do you think?

194
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:31,260
Reporter Oh, we've known each other for some time now. Let's not do this.

195
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:33,890
Then, should I soften it a bit?

196
00:18:33,890 --> 00:18:39,230
"Prosecutor G tries to muddy up his colleague, but embarrasses himself instead." How about this one?

197
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:48,170
Ugh! Seriously!

198
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:56,740
The flower has blossomed so beautifully!

199
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:00,200
It's because you took good care of it.

200
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:04,260
They say you become wiser with age.

201
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:07,160
Or you become patient.

202
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:11,470
They say you become more relaxed, but that's all a lie.

203
00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:14,940
Maybe it's because I'm lacking grace.

204
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:17,960
I have even more things to get upset over.

205
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:22,270
I have less patience.

206
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:26,840
Is it because I'm closer to the day I die?

207
00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:31,890
What was the name of that prosecutor kid?

208
00:19:32,370 --> 00:19:34,650
Did you say it was Baek Joon Soo?

209
00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:45,100
I heard you got nothing out of it even after running a full-on show.

210
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:49,150
CEO Geum, you're extremely incapable when it comes to handling him.

211
00:19:49,150 --> 00:19:53,060
Whether he's real or fake, it doesn't matter anymore.

212
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:58,120
Now that the target is clear, I just have to focus.

213
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:13,780
He hasn't come to work today. I wonder if something's wrong with our Prosecutor Baek.

214
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:15,710
You're CEO Geum Tae Woong, right?

215
00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:19,250
- Who are you? 
 - I'm from the Central District Prosecutors' Office.

216
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:23,860
I'm Inspector Go Gi Bong from the Criminal Investigation Division 6.

217
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:26,370
 Inspector Go Gi Bong 

218
00:20:26,370 --> 00:20:28,680
Why would an inspector be visiting me?

219
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:30,810
Prosecutor Baek Joon Soo sent me.

220
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:37,380
Sa Ma Cheon?

221
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:39,860
Do you remember that?

222
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:45,110
I think I've heard of it before, but why are you mentioning that person to me?

223
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:50,170
There's a record that shows that you were the detective on Sa Ma Cheon's death.

224
00:20:50,170 --> 00:20:53,640
I heard he used to be an infamous con artist.

225
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:56,530
Sa Ma Cheon.

226
00:20:58,020 --> 00:21:00,840
I am aware that he committed suicide.

227
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:04,240
Ah, yes. I do know about that.

228
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:08,650
But I hear it's possible that it could've been a murder.

229
00:21:08,650 --> 00:21:12,610
Since you were the detective on the case, I thought you'd know some details of the investigation.

230
00:21:12,610 --> 00:21:18,310
At the time, do you remember if there was any circumstantial evidence to indicate that it could've been a murder?

231
00:21:29,530 --> 00:21:37,110
Baek Joon Soo. Why is he dragging out what had happened 20 years ago?

232
00:21:43,450 --> 00:21:46,820
So, that's what happened. I understand.

233
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:49,250
Please continue to monitor it.

234
00:21:51,150 --> 00:21:55,040
- Old man! Please give me two bags of rice puffs. 
- Aigoo!

235
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:59,080
Did Miss Hepburn come?

236
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:02,860
Do you remember me? Aigoo, you have a quick eye for learning things.

237
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:05,750
You said your daughter is a prosecutor.

238
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:07,090
Where is she working?

239
00:22:07,090 --> 00:22:10,190
Well, just the District Public Prosecutor's Office.

240
00:22:10,190 --> 00:22:12,190
She's in a really great place.

241
00:22:12,190 --> 00:22:14,840
Wow, I must treat you well.

242
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:16,720
From today on, rice puffs are free.

243
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,160
Really?

244
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:20,880
It's a joke.

245
00:22:23,230 --> 00:22:27,310
Now that I look at it, we have an incredible fate.

246
00:22:27,310 --> 00:22:29,140
Fate? Why?

247
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:33,790
My son is a prosecutor at the District Public Prosecutor's Office.

248
00:22:33,790 --> 00:22:35,910
Really?

249
00:22:35,910 --> 00:22:40,170
The chief prosecutor, he's over 50 years old.

250
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:43,100
You are lying, right?

251
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:45,440
It's a lie!

252
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:46,480
You are always lying.

253
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:52,450
That's why I'm the jokester. Puff, puff, puff! A jokester!

254
00:22:52,450 --> 00:22:55,220
But anyhow, did your daughter get married?

255
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:59,840
No. Don't even mention it...

256
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:03,890
Among her co-workers, there's a prosecutor that follows her as if his life depends on it.

257
00:23:03,890 --> 00:23:06,530
From what I hear, he must be pale and

258
00:23:06,530 --> 00:23:08,650
I hear he's weak as well.

259
00:23:08,650 --> 00:23:11,350
Well, I guess prosecutors don't get paid much.

260
00:23:11,350 --> 00:23:14,770
If you raised her that well, you have to marry her off to a rich family.

261
00:23:14,770 --> 00:23:19,310
Omo, omo. Now we are on the same page.

262
00:23:19,310 --> 00:23:21,960
So, that pale prosecutor's name is?

263
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:25,800
Well, there's this guy named Baek Joon Soo.

264
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:29,380
Then, at Criminal Investigation Division 6?

265
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:34,070
Yes. Huh? How do you know that?

266
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:38,340
I just told you that it was the Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office.

267
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:41,150
That Baek Joon Soo is my son.

268
00:23:41,150 --> 00:23:42,980
Huh...

269
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:48,040
It's a lie.

270
00:23:48,670 --> 00:23:52,050
You just eat a lot of this. I'm not buying today.

271
00:23:52,050 --> 00:23:54,080
I'm not going to eat it!

272
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:57,730
Ah, Miss Hepburn.

273
00:23:57,730 --> 00:23:59,680
Hepburn!

274
00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:05,090
Wow, the world is very small. She is Oh Ha Ra's mother?

275
00:24:08,190 --> 00:24:11,820
You are playing push-and-pull with Baek Joon Soo, right?

276
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:13,780
Why play games with a guy?

277
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:17,650
You can't fall back by pulling too hard.

278
00:24:17,650 --> 00:24:24,830
Also, Prosecutor Baek Joon Soo... Well, Prosecutor Baek Joon Soo is quite a dumba**.

279
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:28,480
Just watch. He'll have to ask me for a favor.

280
00:24:29,570 --> 00:24:35,640
But more than that, the problem is that before Prosecutor Baek Joon Soo's health recovers and he takes back my position,

281
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:41,480
I have to hurry up and find out who Brown Bear is. I don't have too much time.

282
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:50,860
Sunbae, do you remember why I became a prosecutor?

283
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:58,280
When I was falsely charged as a thief, both my classmates and my teacher,

284
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:01,290
no one believed in me.

285
00:25:01,290 --> 00:25:05,710
No matter how much I told them that I may fight, but I never steal,

286
00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:08,220
no one believed me.

287
00:25:10,030 --> 00:25:15,520
The only person that believed in me and eventually cleared me of the accusations

288
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,750
was you.

289
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:25,060
When you got accepted into Seoul National University Law School, I told you that I also wanted to go to law school to become a prosecutor.

290
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:29,580
I never even carried textbooks in my backpack.

291
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:33,750
I didn't go to a prestigious university like you, but I did go to law school.

292
00:25:33,750 --> 00:25:39,200
Even when I was attending the Judicial  Institute, I studied my heart out as if I were crazy.

293
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:43,860
Why? To become a prosecutor.

294
00:25:45,290 --> 00:25:47,910
To become a prosecutor like you.

295
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:54,090
But then, you almost died.

296
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:58,700
Do you think I was able to see anything else?

297
00:26:01,470 --> 00:26:06,820
Thinking that it's okay even if I get fired as a prosecutor, I started this mission.

298
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:10,210
But that doesn't justify what you did.

299
00:26:10,210 --> 00:26:16,320
We are prosecutors. Wrong methods are bound to have bad consequences.

300
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,160
You think I don't know that?

301
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:22,820
Those bastards escape the law, or do things illegally, and even commit murders. They're monsters.

302
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:27,140
What if all of us go to prison before we can put them away in prison?

303
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:30,020
Is that what you mean when you say "according to the law"?

304
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:31,410
I just...

305
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:37,190
want the order to be reversed.

306
00:26:37,190 --> 00:26:41,160
I want to catch Brown Bear and then I will pay for my sin!

307
00:26:45,430 --> 00:26:47,780
Is that so wrong?

308
00:27:06,810 --> 00:27:10,230
So unique. He's worthy of some research.

309
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:16,830
He who looks so handsome, like a statue, there's no way someone like that can be such a stickler.

310
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:21,480
People are usually generous with people who are beautiful.

311
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:24,190
You can be such a stickler even if you want to be.

312
00:27:24,190 --> 00:27:25,950
Look at me, huh?

313
00:27:25,950 --> 00:27:27,620
My heart is always open.

314
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:35,840
Right. You, who are so open-minded, should try to understand Sunbae who is such a stickler.

315
00:27:37,430 --> 00:27:40,260
I will try to convince Sunbae somehow.

316
00:27:40,910 --> 00:27:43,390
Help me again.

317
00:27:43,390 --> 00:27:49,140
Even if I want to help out, there's no way. Prosecutor Baek has his eyes open wide saying he's going to indict me.

318
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:52,030
He can't come back to work in that conditition.

319
00:27:52,030 --> 00:27:55,680
And if you also step out, the investigation will be stopped here.

320
00:27:56,600 --> 00:28:01,130
Then, those people will cut their tails and run away.

321
00:28:01,130 --> 00:28:04,810
Didn't you say you want to catch the bastards who cracked your head?

322
00:28:04,810 --> 00:28:06,930
I'm afraid my head might be cracked again.

323
00:28:06,930 --> 00:28:10,420
You said that you wanted to protect me because I'm going down a dangerous path.

324
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:14,260
Did you perhaps believe those words?

325
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:18,320
Ah, this conman. Is there any truth to the words you say?

326
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:25,360
Are you that furious that you couldn't catch the person who terrorized Prosecutor Baek?

327
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:31,890
That goes for Siunbae Baek. But the fact that I also put you in a dangerous position, I feel responsible for that.

328
00:28:31,890 --> 00:28:36,370
Even if it's for that reason, should we go to the end and catch them?

329
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:50,770
Okay, then we'll start again.

330
00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:52,520
Really?

331
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:55,450
Okay. You can't go back on your words.

332
00:28:56,620 --> 00:29:01,130
Instead, I have three conditions.

333
00:29:01,130 --> 00:29:02,680
Ah, what guy has conditions?

334
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:06,850
Number one, call me "Sunbae" from now on.

335
00:29:06,850 --> 00:29:08,520
Are you really a sunbae?

336
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:12,770
Second, you say that I'm a "conman, conman" every chance you get.

337
00:29:12,770 --> 00:29:15,560
No saying anymore that I'm a conman.

338
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:17,220
Okay, fine.

339
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:19,560
Gosh, he's bringing up all kinds of things. Just like a con artist.

340
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:21,120
Bye.

341
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:26,230
Sunbaenim Go. If the last one is not simple, then I'm not going to listen.

342
00:29:26,230 --> 00:29:28,590
It's simple.

343
00:29:28,590 --> 00:29:33,300
When you look at Prosector Baek, don't look so affectionately at him.

344
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:35,400
When did I look so affectionately...?

345
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:42,460
What is this? No way.  Are you perhaps jealous?

346
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:44,330
Of course, I'm not.

347
00:29:44,330 --> 00:29:45,660
Then, why?

348
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:48,170
Mirror effect.

349
00:29:48,170 --> 00:29:51,670
When you look so affectionately at someone who looks like me,

350
00:29:51,670 --> 00:29:54,470
I get quite confused as if you are looking at me like that.

351
00:29:54,470 --> 00:29:56,220
You are funny.

352
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:04,600
