1
00:00:19,756 --> 00:00:22,342
If you see me spin your deceitful mind.

2
00:00:22,342 --> 00:00:26,419
Then you'll know that
a real G's lust has no end.

3
00:00:26,444 --> 00:00:28,389
I am the fucker on the throne,

4
00:00:28,414 --> 00:00:31,876
I delight in scraping
the entrails off you rotted parasites.

5
00:00:31,901 --> 00:00:35,413
The stench of your whores
assault my nostrils.

6
00:00:35,438 --> 00:00:36,939
Call me Master.

7
00:00:36,939 --> 00:00:40,318
I am the deluge and the storm.
Sitio Diablo is my paradise.

8
00:00:40,318 --> 00:00:42,153
And you shall all bathe in blood,

9
00:00:42,153 --> 00:00:44,336
because that is what Change entails,

10
00:00:44,361 --> 00:00:47,779
and I will repeat, again and again,
I will keep making a fool of you

11
00:00:48,076 --> 00:00:51,622
that I am a messiah and this is my psalm.

12
00:00:52,914 --> 00:00:55,500
We're happy living in our homes;

13
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:58,294
we eat together as a family,

14
00:00:58,294 --> 00:01:00,880
when suddenly the future comes knocking

15
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:03,549
banging on our lives, tearing a hole in it

16
00:01:03,758 --> 00:01:05,968
Everywhere you look, nothing is going right

17
00:01:05,968 --> 00:01:08,554
you say it's progress,
but it looks the opposite

18
00:01:08,554 --> 00:01:11,282
If only we could bring back the past

19
00:01:11,307 --> 00:01:13,976
Down on our knees, where is the justice?

20
00:01:13,976 --> 00:01:16,521
The harsh wind thrashes down my throat

21
00:01:16,521 --> 00:01:19,107
They pretend they know nothing

22
00:01:19,107 --> 00:01:21,776
That's why they can't think of solutions

23
00:01:21,776 --> 00:01:24,153
I hope we can find a way

24
00:01:24,178 --> 00:01:26,931
Because if not,
I'll just keep holding on.

25
00:01:27,448 --> 00:01:30,284
We are the Illustrados,
we're unstoppable.

26
00:01:30,284 --> 00:01:33,996
We are the Illustrados,
modern warriors.

27
00:01:34,021 --> 00:01:38,109
We'll stand up, fight back, Illustrados.
We got balls.

28
00:01:41,671 --> 00:01:42,797
Someone's coming!

29
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:44,381
Get ready! Hey!

30
00:01:47,436 --> 00:01:48,938
Son of a bitch, we're ready for you!

31
00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:50,388
Let me at 'em!

32
00:01:56,018 --> 00:01:57,018
Dude, easy.

33
00:01:59,147 --> 00:02:00,588
We're not looking for trouble.

34
00:02:01,232 --> 00:02:02,232
Shithead!

35
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,860
We're still waiting for payback!

36
00:02:04,235 --> 00:02:05,705
You stabbed my cousin!

37
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:06,815
You attacked us first!

38
00:02:07,394 --> 00:02:08,687
Why are you here?

39
00:02:09,017 --> 00:02:10,808
We want to join forces with you.

40
00:02:10,926 --> 00:02:12,775
We're up against one enemy.

41
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:14,176
The Diablos.

42
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:18,707
We've had disagreements
but I hope we can put it aside.

43
00:02:19,293 --> 00:02:21,045
We've got beef with them, too.

44
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,283
How can we be sure
you won't fuck us over?

45
00:02:24,338 --> 00:02:25,715
You know me, Macoy.

46
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:26,908
Bullet.

47
00:02:27,166 --> 00:02:29,760
Even back when we were in Diablo,
I'm a man of my word.

48
00:02:44,637 --> 00:02:46,322
You'll leave Tonix to me.

49
00:02:47,088 --> 00:02:48,320
He's all yours.

50
00:02:52,575 --> 00:02:55,330
Let's go kill some Diablos!

51
00:03:09,133 --> 00:03:11,052
Go to Aina's.

52
00:03:11,077 --> 00:03:12,703
Bro, I'm ready for this.

53
00:03:15,515 --> 00:03:16,741
Bro, I can do this.

54
00:03:16,766 --> 00:03:19,436
This still isn't your
fight, bro. Get out of here.

55
00:03:19,961 --> 00:03:20,961
Macoy!

56
00:03:33,221 --> 00:03:36,613
These fucking snakes
are out of their nest.

57
00:03:37,161 --> 00:03:38,746
Look at you, you big fat ballsack!

58
00:03:39,182 --> 00:03:40,726
Fuck you! Shut up!

59
00:03:43,167 --> 00:03:46,096
- You fucker!
- You son of a bitch!

60
00:03:47,213 --> 00:03:50,104
Fuck you! Let's see what you got!

61
00:03:50,322 --> 00:03:51,322
Let's go!

62
00:03:55,012 --> 00:03:56,097
Bullet!

63
00:04:08,734 --> 00:04:09,734
Bro!

64
00:04:10,945 --> 00:04:12,705
Aina, get out of there!

65
00:04:23,958 --> 00:04:25,620
Get out of the way!

66
00:04:34,174 --> 00:04:37,763
Aina, get out of the way!

67
00:04:37,763 --> 00:04:40,891
Sitio Diablo is cursed.

68
00:04:42,846 --> 00:04:44,292
Beat him up.

69
00:04:45,521 --> 00:04:48,733
Its real name is Sitio Santiago.

70
00:04:50,109 --> 00:04:52,945
James was one
of the first apostles of Jesus.

71
00:04:53,613 --> 00:04:57,992
A holy saint. But in this sitio,

72
00:04:57,992 --> 00:05:00,494
the saintly dies…

73
00:05:00,494 --> 00:05:03,956
so even angels turn into demons.

74
00:05:03,956 --> 00:05:05,124
Goddamn.

75
00:05:05,291 --> 00:05:06,411
Throw him out!

76
00:05:19,972 --> 00:05:22,052
The goody-goodies have no place here.

77
00:05:23,051 --> 00:05:24,594
No weaklings.

78
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:28,147
The nice ones don't have a chance.

79
00:05:28,731 --> 00:05:32,401
In this place, violence thrives.

80
00:05:33,486 --> 00:05:36,113
You have to be more evil than the devil.

81
00:05:37,073 --> 00:05:39,325
But you can't survive on courage alone;

82
00:05:40,534 --> 00:05:45,817
Devils, when they come together,
are more terrifying.

83
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:53,047
And if you join these demons,
Go ahead.

84
00:05:53,297 --> 00:05:55,212
Kill him already!

85
00:05:55,533 --> 00:05:58,640
you can forget about
getting out of this hell-hole.

86
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:00,429
Kill him!

87
00:06:22,326 --> 00:06:24,328
Kid, you're a natural!

88
00:06:25,788 --> 00:06:26,789
Way to go!

89
00:06:30,167 --> 00:06:32,461
Nice work, kid!

90
00:06:40,803 --> 00:06:43,472
There's only one way out of here:

91
00:06:45,224 --> 00:06:46,308
Death.

92
00:07:14,336 --> 00:07:17,972
Ask your leader if we can
campaign here on Calle Trese.

93
00:07:17,997 --> 00:07:19,316
Sure, go ahead!

94
00:07:19,341 --> 00:07:21,093
You're talking to us, the leaders.

95
00:07:21,093 --> 00:07:21,969
Isn't that right, Askal?

96
00:07:21,969 --> 00:07:24,764
We can handle the people around here.

97
00:07:24,764 --> 00:07:25,931
300 pesos, just in case?

98
00:07:25,931 --> 00:07:27,385
300 pesos?

99
00:07:28,151 --> 00:07:30,436
That makes 3,000 pesos for ten people.

100
00:07:30,461 --> 00:07:34,298
That's not all. You'll get free rides on
a bus or jeep, and food, too.

101
00:07:34,323 --> 00:07:36,868
All I can tell you is "Yes, sir!"

102
00:07:36,901 --> 00:07:39,086
"Yes ma'am!" Yes!

103
00:07:39,111 --> 00:07:41,614
Just make sure you have
a hundred people for me.

104
00:07:41,722 --> 00:07:44,325
All right. A hundred people.
Easy-peasy, yeah? Askal?

105
00:07:44,363 --> 00:07:46,495
- I'll leave it to you.
- All right.

106
00:07:58,339 --> 00:08:01,050
We're already done, Mayor.

107
00:08:06,263 --> 00:08:09,892
- Thank you so much, Mayor.
- No, thank you.

108
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:17,858
Hey, how are you guys?

109
00:08:22,488 --> 00:08:25,366
Mayor! Mayor have a drink with us!

110
00:08:30,764 --> 00:08:33,878
Mayor! Mayor!

111
00:08:37,169 --> 00:08:38,587
Mayor, any will do.

112
00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:48,848
Thank you, thank you so much!
Thank you, thank you so much!

113
00:08:50,469 --> 00:08:54,300
You dickhead. Trese's not our territory.
It's Aztec's.

114
00:08:55,104 --> 00:08:56,814
Not my fault they're birdbrains.

115
00:08:57,731 --> 00:09:00,793
Birdbrains? What if the Aztecs find out
what you did? What then?

116
00:09:00,818 --> 00:09:03,237
Hey. We did that.

117
00:09:04,530 --> 00:09:07,206
Don't say we. That's all you.
It was your idea.

118
00:09:07,946 --> 00:09:09,114
I see how it is.

119
00:09:09,139 --> 00:09:10,349
Give me your hand.

120
00:09:10,374 --> 00:09:11,583
Now it's on both of us, huh?

121
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:12,497
Come on.

122
00:09:12,538 --> 00:09:15,207
Wait, 500? That person gave you 5,000.
You're giving me 500?

123
00:09:15,232 --> 00:09:16,432
You're giving me chump change?

124
00:09:17,084 --> 00:09:19,378
Fine. You're a pain in the butt.

125
00:09:19,448 --> 00:09:20,968
Be thankful you're getting any at all.

126
00:09:22,006 --> 00:09:24,800
This is great. I have money for school.

127
00:09:25,593 --> 00:09:27,845
What's school gonna do for you?

128
00:09:28,095 --> 00:09:29,221
Just tag along with me.

129
00:09:29,972 --> 00:09:33,475
I'll give you money.
I'll teach you how to make money, man.

130
00:09:33,517 --> 00:09:34,977
You know what, forget it.

131
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:38,375
I still think it's better
if you've gone to school,

132
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,148
earn a diploma.
You'll get a good...

133
00:09:40,173 --> 00:09:42,926
Fuck, man. Diplomas can be forged in Recto.

134
00:09:43,168 --> 00:09:44,211
Do what you like.

135
00:09:44,236 --> 00:09:47,114
I'm just worried about that the Aztecs
will find out what you did.

136
00:09:47,139 --> 00:09:49,683
That we cheated them of their profts.

137
00:09:49,769 --> 00:09:52,146
Fuck, man. Don't be so nervous.

138
00:09:52,171 --> 00:09:54,883
Besides, that homo
doesn't know I'm an Illustrado.

139
00:09:54,914 --> 00:09:55,914
Chill out.

140
00:09:56,207 --> 00:09:57,626
Look how much we scored.

141
00:10:10,262 --> 00:10:11,889
Dude, act normal.

142
00:10:12,431 --> 00:10:13,431
Don’t look suspicious.

143
00:10:20,773 --> 00:10:21,941
Askal. Damnit, run!

144
00:10:44,296 --> 00:10:45,381
You two.

145
00:10:46,392 --> 00:10:48,983
Are you the ones
Magdangal's campaign manager talked to?

146
00:10:49,199 --> 00:10:51,393
Huh? Who's that?

147
00:10:52,961 --> 00:10:54,504
Don't bullshit me.

148
00:10:54,807 --> 00:10:55,807
Give me the money.

149
00:10:56,850 --> 00:10:59,090
What money? Dude,
I don't know what you're talking about.

150
00:10:59,895 --> 00:11:01,313
I know those two.

151
00:11:01,563 --> 00:11:02,940
They're Illustrado.

152
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:05,484
Fucking Bullet's trying to play me.

153
00:11:08,346 --> 00:11:11,224
Search them. Take everything they got.

154
00:11:41,979 --> 00:11:42,979
What's this?

155
00:11:44,648 --> 00:11:46,775
Fucking hell, Bullet.
Keep your pets off my turf.

156
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,305
You're in Trese territory!

157
00:11:48,527 --> 00:11:49,527
So what?

158
00:11:49,552 --> 00:11:51,513
What're you yapping about, dickheads?

159
00:11:51,572 --> 00:11:52,740
Give him a taste, Bullet.

160
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:55,409
My hand's been itching
to land a punch on his face.

161
00:11:55,701 --> 00:11:56,994
You know me, Bullet.

162
00:11:57,411 --> 00:11:59,246
We've been pals since Diablo.

163
00:11:59,246 --> 00:12:00,848
I don't know how to tell a lie.

164
00:12:00,873 --> 00:12:02,291
Hey, hey, hey. Bullet.

165
00:12:02,291 --> 00:12:03,709
They're bullshitting you.

166
00:12:03,709 --> 00:12:06,378
We didn't do nothing, man. Ask Askal.

167
00:12:06,378 --> 00:12:07,463
Right, Askal?

168
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:12,384
So, Bullet?

169
00:12:13,061 --> 00:12:14,588
Make a decision.

170
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:22,811
Fuck you, Pons.

171
00:12:23,562 --> 00:12:25,147
I'll let this slide this time.

172
00:12:25,314 --> 00:12:28,901
But next time, I will break your face.

173
00:12:31,282 --> 00:12:34,536
Okay. Keep your boys in line, too.

174
00:12:40,913 --> 00:12:42,164
I'm gonna kill that asshole.

175
00:12:50,339 --> 00:12:51,339
Shithead.

176
00:12:51,924 --> 00:12:52,966
The hell, man.

177
00:12:55,302 --> 00:12:57,012
That's for dragging Askal in your shit.

178
00:12:57,012 --> 00:12:58,722
That fucking hurts.

179
00:12:58,722 --> 00:12:59,973
- Ouch!
- One more till you get it.

180
00:12:59,973 --> 00:13:02,226
That's for making trouble for the group.

181
00:13:02,476 --> 00:13:04,520
You're gonna snap my neck.

182
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:06,563
This.

183
00:13:06,563 --> 00:13:09,191
This will punch a hole in your
skull for sure. There you go.

184
00:13:10,193 --> 00:13:12,236
Hey, Andi. That's enough.

185
00:13:13,028 --> 00:13:14,822
We should grind down his horns.

186
00:13:14,863 --> 00:13:16,115
Are you deaf?

187
00:13:16,538 --> 00:13:18,082
I said that's enough.

188
00:13:18,659 --> 00:13:21,052
He doesn't learn his lesson 'cause
you keep coddling him.

189
00:13:21,101 --> 00:13:22,936
Want my fist to coddle you?

190
00:13:24,456 --> 00:13:26,141
Spank me, mommy!

191
00:13:26,166 --> 00:13:27,584
That's enough.

192
00:13:28,669 --> 00:13:32,047
There you go again,
siding with your girlfriend.

193
00:13:32,673 --> 00:13:34,383
Hey, Andi. Stop it.

194
00:13:43,058 --> 00:13:45,018
Did you learn anything? Pulling
that stupid shit.

195
00:13:45,352 --> 00:13:47,633
I just want to tell you that not
everything's about money.

196
00:13:49,606 --> 00:13:50,606
Yes, sir.

197
00:13:50,983 --> 00:13:55,330
Because of what happened, we got
into trouble with the Aztecs.

198
00:13:56,613 --> 00:13:59,116
You know Pons and I had a deal, right?

199
00:13:59,116 --> 00:14:01,827
That we stay out of each other's territory.

200
00:14:03,912 --> 00:14:05,622
But what did you do?

201
00:14:05,622 --> 00:14:06,623
You dumbass.

202
00:14:07,749 --> 00:14:09,702
You let your greed get the better of you.

203
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:12,382
And you dragged our group into it.

204
00:14:13,213 --> 00:14:14,423
I don't think so.

205
00:14:14,882 --> 00:14:16,300
You know how Pons works.

206
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:18,220
Especially those of you
who've been here longer.

207
00:14:18,594 --> 00:14:19,594
He's an asshole.

208
00:14:20,429 --> 00:14:22,639
But that asshole sticks to his word.

209
00:14:23,515 --> 00:14:26,852
But because of what happened, he can
forget all about our deal.

210
00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:31,565
Fuck, man. He's gonna prepare for war.

211
00:14:34,151 --> 00:14:35,903
So each one of you...

212
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:39,031
is already marked.

213
00:14:39,406 --> 00:14:40,866
He can you take you out.

214
00:14:42,451 --> 00:14:44,369
Let's strike first, then.

215
00:14:45,078 --> 00:14:47,873
Andi, you sound like a fucking newbie.

216
00:14:48,415 --> 00:14:51,251
We'd just be giving them
more reason to fight.

217
00:14:53,437 --> 00:14:56,231
Where'd our balls go, then?
Down Pons' throat?

218
00:14:56,256 --> 00:14:57,674
I thought you were badasses.

219
00:14:57,699 --> 00:14:59,660
Andi, stop poking the fire.

220
00:15:02,012 --> 00:15:06,016
Benny, say something
to your fucking brother.

221
00:15:06,174 --> 00:15:08,551
One more word out of line
and I'll break his face.

222
00:15:09,313 --> 00:15:11,113
You know what's the fucking
problem with you?

223
00:15:11,313 --> 00:15:12,439
You don't use your brains.

224
00:15:12,728 --> 00:15:14,604
It's always your balls talking.

225
00:15:16,151 --> 00:15:17,151
Remember:

226
00:15:19,071 --> 00:15:20,239
We started this.

227
00:15:20,489 --> 00:15:22,199
We're the ones who didn't keep
our end of the deal.

228
00:15:22,224 --> 00:15:23,487
We are in the wrong.

229
00:15:24,451 --> 00:15:25,451
So don't worry.

230
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:28,080
Let me fix this.

231
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,122
I will talk to Pons.

232
00:15:29,122 --> 00:15:31,208
But as long as I haven't talked to him,

233
00:15:31,458 --> 00:15:33,085
as long as this isn't ironed out,

234
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:35,796
you have to be careful.

235
00:15:36,797 --> 00:15:37,923
Avoid Trese.

236
00:15:39,216 --> 00:15:42,110
No one walks alone. If necessary...

237
00:15:42,135 --> 00:15:43,220
stay in groups.

238
00:15:44,930 --> 00:15:45,930
Is that clear?

239
00:15:46,890 --> 00:15:49,986
- Is that clear?
- Yeah.

240
00:16:03,407 --> 00:16:05,492
You think Pons will back down?

241
00:16:09,246 --> 00:16:10,580
I'll talk to him.

242
00:16:11,081 --> 00:16:12,416
We had some good times together.

243
00:16:14,293 --> 00:16:15,377
I guess.

244
00:16:16,211 --> 00:16:18,046
He owes you a debt of gratitude.

245
00:16:18,630 --> 00:16:19,548
He should be.

246
00:16:19,573 --> 00:16:24,369
Remember when he was
almost killed by the PKP?

247
00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:27,472
But you got to him first.

248
00:16:35,897 --> 00:16:37,316
What's on your mind?

249
00:16:38,525 --> 00:16:39,609
The group.

250
00:16:40,819 --> 00:16:44,529
I'm wondering if they think
I'm getting weaker.

251
00:16:45,866 --> 00:16:46,950
I doubt that.

252
00:16:48,327 --> 00:16:50,203
What you did was right.

253
00:16:51,079 --> 00:16:54,666
The mess will only grow out of hand
if we stick our asses to it.

254
00:16:56,379 --> 00:16:57,839
We're not in Diablos anymore.

255
00:17:02,049 --> 00:17:04,926
Do you regret leaving that place?

256
00:17:07,858 --> 00:17:10,569
The reason why I joined
is only because of you.

257
00:21:11,966 --> 00:21:14,384
Go buy! You fucker!

258
00:21:16,253 --> 00:21:18,464
Hey! Marites!

259
00:21:18,489 --> 00:21:20,699
- What do you want?
- Fuck you!

260
00:21:20,724 --> 00:21:22,826
Hey! What's your problem?

261
00:21:22,851 --> 00:21:24,348
- What?
- Huh?

262
00:21:24,373 --> 00:21:26,688
What rumours are you spewing about Basyo?

263
00:21:26,713 --> 00:21:30,536
You fucking bitch,
I'll chop up your tongue!

264
00:21:30,583 --> 00:21:32,752
- You old bitch.
- What jumper are you talking about?

265
00:21:32,777 --> 00:21:36,865
- It's true, though, isn't it?
- Hey! You ugly son of a bitch!

266
00:21:36,890 --> 00:21:40,286
I'm going to electrocute you fucking bitch.

267
00:21:41,833 --> 00:21:45,661
- Ma'am, that's enough.
- Let me go!

268
00:21:45,686 --> 00:21:49,192
Fuck you!
That shameless fucking bitch.

269
00:21:49,217 --> 00:21:52,480
- You'll drop dead, too!
- Fuck you!

270
00:21:52,505 --> 00:21:55,425
- Fuck you!
- Fuck you!

271
00:21:55,450 --> 00:21:59,913
You whores! I'm gonna
put your tongues through a grinder!

272
00:21:59,938 --> 00:22:03,294
- Pigs! Good-for-nothing!
- Thanks, bro.

273
00:22:03,321 --> 00:22:05,161
Just stay in your houses
and shut the fuck up!

274
00:22:05,542 --> 00:22:09,216
- Give me that.
- Shit. I’ll scrape your fucking tongues.

275
00:22:10,148 --> 00:22:12,193
I'm gonna scratch their tongues
till they bleed.

276
00:22:14,944 --> 00:22:16,237
Ma.

277
00:22:17,072 --> 00:22:19,240
People here have lost respect for me.

278
00:22:19,616 --> 00:22:20,909
Ma, have some water.

279
00:22:22,739 --> 00:22:24,339
She was going around telling everyone...

280
00:22:24,746 --> 00:22:26,373
I'm sleeping with Basyo!

281
00:22:26,690 --> 00:22:28,693
That horrid fucking butt-ugly shrimp.

282
00:22:31,496 --> 00:22:32,962
Tonix is here.

283
00:22:33,922 --> 00:22:36,883
They'll start to think twice,
those motherfuckers.

284
00:22:36,908 --> 00:22:38,683
About speaking ill of me.

285
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:43,431
When Tonix became
supreme leader of Diablos,

286
00:22:43,519 --> 00:22:46,434
he also entered into illegal activities.

287
00:22:46,768 --> 00:22:52,982
Theft, robbery at gunpoint, peddling
illegal drugs, too.

288
00:22:55,975 --> 00:22:58,778
- He's just here to buy.
- My bad, I didn't know.

289
00:23:08,373 --> 00:23:10,583
- How much are we splitting?
- Only this.

290
00:23:14,713 --> 00:23:16,131
Tonix, should I do it?

291
00:23:25,765 --> 00:23:28,643
They became guns for hire, too.

292
00:23:39,279 --> 00:23:41,656
Good thing he wasn't killed by the police.

293
00:23:42,323 --> 00:23:46,953
But because of it, Tonix has
been rotting in City Hall for two years.

294
00:23:47,996 --> 00:23:51,958
Mother says Tonix is doing well.

295
00:23:52,667 --> 00:23:56,713
He's protected by older Diablo members
who became inmates before him.

296
00:23:57,756 --> 00:23:59,401
And you. What have you given me? Huh?

297
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:01,520
Shame and misfortune.

298
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:04,345
Then you whored yourself out to Bullet.

299
00:24:04,345 --> 00:24:06,806
Ma. Bullet is my boyfriend.

300
00:24:06,831 --> 00:24:07,657
What?

301
00:24:07,682 --> 00:24:08,767
Boyfriend?

302
00:24:09,309 --> 00:24:14,522
So when he left Diablo,
you followed him, huh?

303
00:24:14,522 --> 00:24:16,524
You know what that makes you?

304
00:24:16,608 --> 00:24:17,608
A traitor!

305
00:24:17,898 --> 00:24:19,920
Let me just remind you, Aina.

306
00:24:19,969 --> 00:24:24,224
Your father is the founder of Sitio Diablo.

307
00:24:25,116 --> 00:24:30,038
This place was built with his blood.
And that blood runs through your veins.

308
00:24:33,792 --> 00:24:37,212
I don't know why I keep expecting
anything from you in Diablo.

309
00:24:37,712 --> 00:24:39,512
You're a girl.
You're of no use to the group.

310
00:24:41,312 --> 00:24:43,009
At least High-C

311
00:24:44,219 --> 00:24:45,553
checks on me from time to time.

312
00:24:45,671 --> 00:24:48,816
Fuck, what about you? Nothing. I can't
expect anything from you.

313
00:24:48,973 --> 00:24:51,601
You know what, just leave me alone. I'll be
cranky all day looking at you.

314
00:24:51,601 --> 00:24:53,353
Leave me. Get out of my face.

315
00:24:53,686 --> 00:24:54,854
Go on. Go away.

316
00:24:57,941 --> 00:24:59,567
What are you standing around for?

317
00:25:01,801 --> 00:25:05,015
Go away! Or I'll throw
this at you! Go ahead!

318
00:25:06,199 --> 00:25:08,785
This little bitch. How dare you.

319
00:25:10,411 --> 00:25:11,496
Go away!

320
00:25:12,121 --> 00:25:13,706
Go be with Bullet!

321
00:25:13,915 --> 00:25:16,130
You fucking bitch. You're pissing me off!

322
00:25:16,835 --> 00:25:19,379
Well, fuck's your problem? Get out of here!

323
00:25:20,108 --> 00:25:21,818
I can't stand you.

324
00:25:22,181 --> 00:25:24,560
I can't get any comfort from you. Fuck.

325
00:25:25,144 --> 00:25:27,063
Now you're pissing me off.

326
00:25:28,763 --> 00:25:30,139
- Ma!
- Yeah?

327
00:25:30,139 --> 00:25:31,139
How's it going?

328
00:25:31,888 --> 00:25:34,140
Bless. This is Kira, by the way.

329
00:25:35,078 --> 00:25:35,954
What happened to you, Ma?

330
00:25:35,979 --> 00:25:38,773
Those stupid neighbors
are driving me crazy!

331
00:25:38,798 --> 00:25:42,552
- It's because Tonix's still in jail.
- Shit, that's right.

332
00:25:42,855 --> 00:25:45,947
When he gets back,
we're gonna cut off all their power.

333
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:07,195
What the fuck? Where are you taking me?

334
00:26:08,094 --> 00:26:10,054
Fuck, is this where you'll kill me?

335
00:26:11,462 --> 00:26:12,462
Tonix.

336
00:26:13,099 --> 00:26:14,350
Long time no see.

337
00:26:16,198 --> 00:26:19,159
You can always visit me in jail, sir.

338
00:26:20,064 --> 00:26:21,149
Tonix, man.

339
00:26:21,441 --> 00:26:24,068
You know this meeting's secret.

340
00:26:25,653 --> 00:26:26,653
So,

341
00:26:27,405 --> 00:26:28,405
you wanna get out yet?

342
00:26:30,199 --> 00:26:31,199
Don't worry,

343
00:26:31,701 --> 00:26:33,286
I'm not gonna kill you here.

344
00:26:33,311 --> 00:26:35,163
I still got use for you.

345
00:26:35,816 --> 00:26:36,816
Uncuff him.

346
00:26:40,126 --> 00:26:41,126
Kid.

347
00:26:41,538 --> 00:26:43,123
If you want to get out,

348
00:26:43,148 --> 00:26:44,631
we can make that happen.

349
00:26:45,616 --> 00:26:48,468
I'll arrange for
your release papers, Tonix.

350
00:26:50,093 --> 00:26:52,721
- Get his release papers ready.
- Yes, boss.

351
00:26:53,306 --> 00:26:54,682
What's the catch?

352
00:26:55,984 --> 00:26:57,185
Slow down, Tonix.

353
00:26:57,210 --> 00:27:00,939
That's what we've come here for.
You understand?

354
00:27:03,325 --> 00:27:06,277
That old fart Magdanga, he's loaded, huh?

355
00:27:06,668 --> 00:27:09,045
When he wins, his stash
is just gonna grow for sure.

356
00:27:09,070 --> 00:27:11,114
He might even double his income.

357
00:27:11,824 --> 00:27:14,702
We don't know that.
Let's give him a chance.

358
00:27:14,702 --> 00:27:17,121
Stop talking about politics.

359
00:27:17,499 --> 00:27:19,798
You're just kids.
What the hell do you know?

360
00:27:20,795 --> 00:27:24,562
- Kids? Can't kids join the conversation?
- Right.

361
00:27:24,587 --> 00:27:27,256
Let Macoy be. He doesn't believe
in the government anymore.

362
00:27:27,256 --> 00:27:28,702
Well, it's true.

363
00:27:29,050 --> 00:27:30,843
Doesn't matter who you put up there.

364
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,436
Not a damn thing's going to change for us.

365
00:27:33,513 --> 00:27:38,267
He's got a point. We'll still be
fighting over a piece of bread to survive.

366
00:27:38,267 --> 00:27:41,688
And that shit about
twenty-peso rice? Fuck that.

367
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:43,731
Watch it.

368
00:27:43,731 --> 00:27:47,026
Watch it or you'll piss off each other.

369
00:27:47,051 --> 00:27:51,222
I remember that old couple Marta
and Berto. You know them.

370
00:27:51,447 --> 00:27:55,118
They quarelled because they're voting
for different presidents.

371
00:27:55,118 --> 00:27:57,495
I saw them chasing each other
with a machete.

372
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:01,315
- For real?
- You brown-noser!

373
00:28:01,584 --> 00:28:05,256
Hey, shit, did you hear about
what happened to Jepoy?

374
00:28:05,712 --> 00:28:07,005
One of the Aztecs.

375
00:28:07,971 --> 00:28:08,971
What happened?

376
00:28:09,298 --> 00:28:10,842
He got stabbed last night.

377
00:28:11,310 --> 00:28:12,353
He's dead.

378
00:28:15,304 --> 00:28:16,347
You fuckers.

379
00:28:17,515 --> 00:28:19,350
Own up. Whose work was that?

380
00:28:19,809 --> 00:28:20,809
Huh?

381
00:28:21,769 --> 00:28:23,312
Psst. Andi.

382
00:28:24,772 --> 00:28:25,523
Hey.

383
00:28:25,773 --> 00:28:27,900
Fuck, man, don't look at me. I don't
know anything about that!

384
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:30,170
Watch your mouth, asshole. That's my
girlfriend you're swearing at.

385
00:28:30,194 --> 00:28:31,904
I'm fucking telling you. I had
nothing to do with that.

386
00:28:31,929 --> 00:28:34,807
I was at Benny's last night. Right, bro?

387
00:28:36,816 --> 00:28:37,969
See.

388
00:28:37,994 --> 00:28:40,246
Fuck. Pons is going to pin that on us.

389
00:28:40,271 --> 00:28:41,271
He'll get back at us.

390
00:28:42,130 --> 00:28:43,130
We should

391
00:28:43,881 --> 00:28:45,166
watch our backs.

392
00:28:46,226 --> 00:28:47,311
What the fuck?

393
00:28:47,336 --> 00:28:50,173
Why should we? Let's just strike first.

394
00:28:50,173 --> 00:28:52,925
Strike first? We don't have a plan.

395
00:28:52,925 --> 00:28:56,095
If we're going to hit them,
we can't do it willy-nilly.

396
00:29:15,114 --> 00:29:18,034
You are my priority.

397
00:29:18,059 --> 00:29:23,122
Together we will change
the course of our fates!

398
00:29:26,647 --> 00:29:28,961
Let's hold each other's arms.

399
00:29:28,961 --> 00:29:31,756
We will lift ourselves up!

400
00:29:32,090 --> 00:29:34,884
We shall keep the road open to City Hall!

401
00:29:38,930 --> 00:29:40,306
So friends,

402
00:29:40,306 --> 00:29:42,517
I'm asking you,

403
00:29:42,517 --> 00:29:45,686
in the coming election, don't forget,

404
00:29:45,686 --> 00:29:47,960
the third name on your ballots:

405
00:29:48,356 --> 00:29:50,691
Magdangal for Mayor!

406
00:29:53,451 --> 00:29:56,300
I heard you’re running this place.

407
00:29:58,634 --> 00:30:02,105
Don't worry. This is our territory.
We'll take care of it.

408
00:30:02,335 --> 00:30:05,380
Whatever I promised tonight,

409
00:30:05,792 --> 00:30:09,173
We will make it happen. In less
than a hundred days, it will happen!

410
00:30:10,144 --> 00:30:13,147
You'll have food on your table.

411
00:30:13,172 --> 00:30:16,306
Because every one of you
will have decent jobs!

412
00:30:26,983 --> 00:30:28,980
Can I get a round of applause?

413
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:31,363
Been keeping this a secret for a while

414
00:30:31,388 --> 00:30:34,641
Who's my idol? It's Artemio Magdangal!

415
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:37,446
So if you want a thick wad
of cash every month

416
00:30:37,471 --> 00:30:40,600
vote for the mayor who knows how to love!

417
00:30:46,873 --> 00:30:47,915
Comin' in hot.

418
00:30:48,958 --> 00:30:52,461
You can die, we all have problems,
don't get carried away.

419
00:30:52,461 --> 00:30:54,630
It's not all bad luck at hand

420
00:30:54,630 --> 00:30:57,175
Death is in a car, don't get in it

421
00:30:57,175 --> 00:30:59,218
It's heavy, it's not obvious

422
00:30:59,218 --> 00:31:01,596
Why even though it's clear,
it seems like no one can?

423
00:31:01,596 --> 00:31:03,890
You are hiding and crying on your hands

424
00:31:03,890 --> 00:31:06,142
Tell me your problem. How bad?

425
00:31:06,142 --> 00:31:07,560
Your shoes are the problem,

426
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:10,980
those others have no feet but fight
life with almost no trepidation

427
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:13,065
You are not weak, I want you to fight more

428
00:31:13,065 --> 00:31:15,401
Stand there and wipe your eyes

429
00:31:15,401 --> 00:31:18,029
If you don't know who to turn to,

430
00:31:18,029 --> 00:31:20,531
even with a blade
you can't hold on to anything,

431
00:31:20,531 --> 00:31:22,658
no matter how deep the misfortunes,

432
00:31:22,658 --> 00:31:25,453
there is always God, you can pray on.

433
00:31:27,830 --> 00:31:29,957
Yeah! Shout out to Mayor Magdangal!

434
00:31:29,989 --> 00:31:33,728
Yeah!

435
00:31:33,753 --> 00:31:39,634
Suddenly, all the world slowed down

436
00:31:42,845 --> 00:31:45,264
When you showed up out of the blue

437
00:31:48,476 --> 00:31:50,895
As I turned at the corner

438
00:31:54,065 --> 00:31:58,319
We met at an unexpected time

439
00:31:58,319 --> 00:32:03,699
And we spoke in that fated moment

440
00:32:04,367 --> 00:32:09,247
Like a star, is this real or is it a dream?

441
00:32:09,747 --> 00:32:14,627
I wish I could ask you before I wake up

442
00:32:19,976 --> 00:32:22,045
Young miss

443
00:32:22,343 --> 00:32:24,971
Will you be my baby?

444
00:32:25,263 --> 00:32:28,032
Will you be my lady?

445
00:32:28,057 --> 00:32:36,482
If you want to reach for the stars
Reach for the stars, we'll fly to heaven

446
00:32:36,482 --> 00:32:40,486
And touch them together

447
00:32:40,486 --> 00:32:44,532
Let the fun begin!

448
00:33:12,539 --> 00:33:14,891
Fuck! The Aztecs are here!

449
00:33:23,738 --> 00:33:24,739
Pons!

450
00:33:47,261 --> 00:33:48,346
Son of a bitch!

451
00:33:51,893 --> 00:33:54,854
We had a deal. No stealing into
each other's territory.

452
00:33:55,019 --> 00:33:56,812
No going behind each other's back!

453
00:33:56,812 --> 00:33:58,397
What the fuck are you on about?

454
00:33:58,397 --> 00:34:00,399
Japoy! He was killed
by one of yours, wasn't he?

455
00:34:01,442 --> 00:34:02,442
Motherfucker.

456
00:34:54,004 --> 00:34:56,705
Fuck you! I didn't betray you, asshole!

457
00:34:57,498 --> 00:34:58,498
I dare you!

458
00:34:59,375 --> 00:35:01,175
You challenge me
one more time, motherfucker,

459
00:35:02,211 --> 00:35:04,255
and I'll slash your fucking head off.

460
00:35:08,884 --> 00:35:10,010
Askal!

461
00:35:12,551 --> 00:35:13,973
Askal! What happened?

462
00:35:13,973 --> 00:35:16,183
- Help!
- Askal's been hit!

463
00:35:16,892 --> 00:35:17,935
You bitch.

464
00:35:21,355 --> 00:35:23,232
Askal, you can do this.

465
00:35:28,195 --> 00:35:30,315
- Askal, you need to bear it.
- I don't want to die.

466
00:35:30,573 --> 00:35:32,199
You're not gonna die, stupid.

467
00:35:32,450 --> 00:35:34,660
Hang on, dude. You're gonna be fine.

468
00:35:34,910 --> 00:35:37,663
You're toughshit, right? You can do this.

469
00:35:37,688 --> 00:35:39,248
Askal.

470
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:40,583
Does it hurt?

471
00:35:42,668 --> 00:35:44,587
You can do it, man. Just hold on.

472
00:35:44,587 --> 00:35:46,130
You can do it.

473
00:35:46,130 --> 00:35:47,423
You can do it, Askal.

474
00:35:47,423 --> 00:35:48,423
Go on, scream it out.

475
00:35:50,176 --> 00:35:51,816
Just a little bit more. It's almost over.

476
00:35:52,470 --> 00:35:53,554
Hang on a little bit.

477
00:35:55,514 --> 00:35:58,267
You can do it, man.
It's just an ant's bite.

478
00:35:58,517 --> 00:36:00,060
But the ant's this big.

479
00:36:01,645 --> 00:36:02,645
Bullet.

480
00:36:04,148 --> 00:36:06,442
We still need to bring him to the hospital.

481
00:36:08,503 --> 00:36:09,503
Hold on.

482
00:36:16,202 --> 00:36:17,411
You dipshit.

483
00:36:17,786 --> 00:36:20,097
The kid almost died
because of what you did.

484
00:36:20,122 --> 00:36:21,682
That's on them.

485
00:36:21,707 --> 00:36:25,419
I just got back at them for starting
that fight, that's why I took out Japoy.

486
00:36:25,628 --> 00:36:29,173
You fuckhead. You just made it all worse.

487
00:36:30,925 --> 00:36:33,802
What's wrong with a little thrill, right?

488
00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:36,096
This group is boring me out of my mind.

489
00:36:37,139 --> 00:36:38,739
You should have thought about the group.

490
00:36:39,747 --> 00:36:41,332
I already have a wife.

491
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:44,104
I've got two kids.

492
00:36:44,396 --> 00:36:46,196
I'm getting sick
of looking after you, Andi.

493
00:36:46,690 --> 00:36:48,330
I'm gonna have to tell Bullet about this.

494
00:36:49,193 --> 00:36:50,236
Hey.

495
00:36:50,465 --> 00:36:52,280
Don't tell Bullet.

496
00:36:52,516 --> 00:36:54,921
He might sacrifice me to Pons.

497
00:36:55,366 --> 00:36:59,495
Besides, we play a big part in the group.

498
00:37:00,037 --> 00:37:01,705
We're valuable to them.

499
00:37:12,007 --> 00:37:14,301
You should go. You might wake the kids.

500
00:37:15,636 --> 00:37:16,636
Get out.

501
00:37:16,887 --> 00:37:17,887
Hurry up.

502
00:37:39,159 --> 00:37:40,159
Take it easy, man.

503
00:37:42,871 --> 00:37:44,248
I'll bring him inside, grandma.

504
00:37:50,885 --> 00:37:52,970
Could I have a word with you both?

505
00:37:53,632 --> 00:37:55,217
Sure, grandma. What is it?

506
00:37:55,242 --> 00:37:58,287
Could you leave
Askal out of your gang?

507
00:38:00,290 --> 00:38:03,126
Grandma, that decision is up to Askal.

508
00:38:03,492 --> 00:38:05,657
Whether or not
he wants to leave...

509
00:38:06,051 --> 00:38:08,196
No! What does Askal
know about all this fighting?

510
00:38:08,221 --> 00:38:10,682
My grandson is only 17 years old.

511
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:14,715
I know you both grew up here in the sitio.

512
00:38:14,740 --> 00:38:17,702
You're well aware of the violence
that thrives in this place.

513
00:38:18,741 --> 00:38:22,739
But I have dreams for my grandson.

514
00:38:23,746 --> 00:38:25,477
I don't want him to
end up like his father

515
00:38:25,501 --> 00:38:28,292
who just died from fist-fights
with degenerates.

516
00:38:29,043 --> 00:38:31,942
Askal's got smarts.
He's an honor student.

517
00:38:32,092 --> 00:38:36,721
I can't let him waste his
chances by tagging along with you!

518
00:38:38,085 --> 00:38:40,512
Don't worry, grandma.

519
00:38:41,528 --> 00:38:43,813
- We've got Askal under our protection.
- What?

520
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:47,728
My grandson got stabbed. What protection
are you talking about?

521
00:38:50,415 --> 00:38:52,559
Askal is all I have.

522
00:38:53,817 --> 00:38:58,781
I won't lose him to the barbarity
of this place. Do you understand?

523
00:39:00,871 --> 00:39:05,417
All right, grandma.
We'll speak to Askal.

524
00:39:06,616 --> 00:39:11,245
He'll also be the one to decide
if he'll leave or stay.

525
00:39:18,342 --> 00:39:19,843
I'm losing faith in Bullet.

526
00:39:20,239 --> 00:39:21,949
His balls are getting soft.

527
00:39:22,304 --> 00:39:23,889
Influenced by his girlfriend!

528
00:39:24,598 --> 00:39:25,683
What makes you say that?

529
00:39:26,058 --> 00:39:27,309
If I were him,

530
00:39:28,852 --> 00:39:30,622
I'd have finished Pons
when I had him by the neck.

531
00:39:30,646 --> 00:39:32,231
The trouble would have been dealt with!

532
00:39:33,023 --> 00:39:36,068
The Aztecs would declare war
if Bullet had killed Pons.

533
00:39:36,752 --> 00:39:38,420
There you go again, Benny.

534
00:39:38,445 --> 00:39:40,364
You're taking the side
of your leader again.

535
00:39:40,559 --> 00:39:42,324
And you're such a fan
so you're defending him.

536
00:39:42,349 --> 00:39:44,017
That's why you can't see his faults.

537
00:39:44,276 --> 00:39:46,095
Bullet's just trying to protect us.

538
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:47,705
In the event of a clash,
we're at a disadvantage.

539
00:39:47,823 --> 00:39:51,201
For starters, there's more of them.
More people, more weapons.

540
00:39:51,517 --> 00:39:54,103
There's more of them, sure.
But who's stronger?

541
00:39:54,128 --> 00:39:55,462
- Damn right.
- Right?

542
00:39:55,487 --> 00:39:57,856
Besides, Bullet's getting on my last nerve.

543
00:39:58,068 --> 00:40:01,405
It's probably better if
I break away from the group.

544
00:40:01,575 --> 00:40:03,405
I'll just put up my own.

545
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:06,335
Hey. Hey, don't do that, bro.

546
00:40:06,448 --> 00:40:07,616
You can't leave us behind!

547
00:40:07,641 --> 00:40:08,641
Yeah right.

548
00:40:11,756 --> 00:40:14,261
If you're leaving, then do it for real.

549
00:40:15,065 --> 00:40:19,153
Get away from this thug life altogether
instead of making your own group.

550
00:40:19,178 --> 00:40:20,698
What, you're gonna go against us, too?

551
00:40:23,255 --> 00:40:25,132
Whoa. One of the Diablos lost his way.

552
00:40:28,287 --> 00:40:29,407
I don't have anything on me.

553
00:40:30,122 --> 00:40:31,122
Why are you here?

554
00:40:32,374 --> 00:40:33,374
Where's Aina?

555
00:40:33,448 --> 00:40:34,448
Why?

556
00:40:35,377 --> 00:40:36,676
Tonix got out.

557
00:40:41,175 --> 00:40:42,416
Tonix.

558
00:40:43,113 --> 00:40:44,361
How's it going?

559
00:40:44,386 --> 00:40:45,770
Son of a bitch.

560
00:40:52,978 --> 00:40:54,480
- Damn, I missed you.
- Tonix.

561
00:40:54,542 --> 00:40:55,497
Tonix,

562
00:40:55,522 --> 00:40:56,982
ever since you got jailed,

563
00:40:57,007 --> 00:41:00,552
some of our members broke away.

564
00:41:01,028 --> 00:41:03,405
Some of them made their own factions.

565
00:41:04,198 --> 00:41:05,574
I tried to stop them.

566
00:41:05,657 --> 00:41:06,992
But all they care about is money.

567
00:41:07,659 --> 00:41:08,744
Let them be.

568
00:41:09,997 --> 00:41:11,647
Let's leave that for later.

569
00:41:13,515 --> 00:41:14,933
I missed you guys.

570
00:45:31,423 --> 00:45:33,550
Here. Still hot.

571
00:45:34,092 --> 00:45:37,012
My back…

572
00:45:37,471 --> 00:45:42,140
You have to forgive me, son.
I couldn't visit you in the city jail.

573
00:45:42,324 --> 00:45:44,701
I'll make it up to you, all right?

574
00:45:45,230 --> 00:45:47,399
I'll cook your favorite food.

575
00:45:48,565 --> 00:45:49,608
Go on. Eat up.

576
00:45:50,317 --> 00:45:54,988
Hi-C told me the neighbors are giving
you a hard time while I was in jail.

577
00:45:55,498 --> 00:45:56,833
Yeah,

578
00:45:57,532 --> 00:45:59,993
itchy-tongued neighbors
and their fucking lies.

579
00:46:00,018 --> 00:46:01,937
They keep spreading all sorts of gossip.

580
00:46:02,537 --> 00:46:06,708
Don't worry, Ma. We'll cut
off their tongues.

581
00:46:06,708 --> 00:46:08,126
Make an example of them.

582
00:46:09,086 --> 00:46:12,255
Now that I'm here,
nobody's going to mess with you.

583
00:46:12,923 --> 00:46:14,925
You'll be an empress.

584
00:46:15,127 --> 00:46:16,593
Really, son?

585
00:46:16,952 --> 00:46:18,429
Dig in. Help yourself.

586
00:46:19,012 --> 00:46:20,138
Eat well.
Eat up, son.

587
00:46:24,267 --> 00:46:25,393
Eat up.

588
00:46:26,728 --> 00:46:27,854
- Well.
- Bro.

589
00:46:28,647 --> 00:46:32,150
Look what the cat dragged in.

590
00:46:37,906 --> 00:46:39,074
When did you get out?

591
00:46:39,640 --> 00:46:40,992
Just the other day.

592
00:46:41,299 --> 00:46:43,606
Come on, let's eat.

593
00:46:44,996 --> 00:46:46,623
It's okay, bro. I already ate.

594
00:46:46,656 --> 00:46:48,499
We don't have any more plates.

595
00:46:50,739 --> 00:46:52,616
Pick off the fishbones for Tonix.

596
00:46:55,006 --> 00:46:56,508
Come back to Diablo.

597
00:46:57,050 --> 00:46:58,051
You and Bullet.

598
00:46:59,010 --> 00:47:00,470
Bring in the whole gang.

599
00:47:01,805 --> 00:47:02,848
I'll take care of you.

600
00:47:04,121 --> 00:47:07,429
I heard about your clash with Pons' gang.

601
00:47:07,991 --> 00:47:09,708
I can protect you.

602
00:47:10,341 --> 00:47:12,038
Just come back to Diablo.

603
00:47:12,899 --> 00:47:13,899
Bro,

604
00:47:15,068 --> 00:47:17,028
that's not my decision anymore.

605
00:47:19,364 --> 00:47:21,241
It's Bullet's call.

606
00:47:21,533 --> 00:47:23,177
You trust that guy?

607
00:47:23,730 --> 00:47:25,677
We're family.

608
00:47:26,037 --> 00:47:28,240
We should be comrades.

609
00:47:38,341 --> 00:47:40,385
What are you pissed about? Eat first.

610
00:47:41,136 --> 00:47:42,136
Relax.

611
00:47:42,519 --> 00:47:44,688
You're always causing problems...

612
00:47:50,020 --> 00:47:51,062
Yummy.

613
00:48:13,668 --> 00:48:14,948
Do you think I've gotten weaker?

614
00:48:16,588 --> 00:48:17,588
You bet.

615
00:48:19,130 --> 00:48:23,612
Back then, you wouldn't think twice about
knocking down your opponent.

616
00:48:26,431 --> 00:48:29,122
I thought you said you'll snatch
Tonix' throne from him?

617
00:48:29,147 --> 00:48:30,732
That's why I followed you.

618
00:48:31,519 --> 00:48:32,687
Now

619
00:48:33,068 --> 00:48:35,941
you're acting all soft on us.

620
00:48:36,524 --> 00:48:39,277
Where'd your swag go?
You're losing your cool vibe.

621
00:48:40,362 --> 00:48:43,156
Are you gonna let that happen?
Don't let that happen.

622
00:48:43,573 --> 00:48:44,573
You can't.

623
00:48:46,701 --> 00:48:48,021
What do you want me to do?

624
00:48:49,287 --> 00:48:50,372
Of course,

625
00:48:50,830 --> 00:48:54,167
you gotta show this place that you're king.

626
00:48:54,192 --> 00:48:55,945
That nobody fucks with you.

627
00:48:56,445 --> 00:48:58,333
Protect your reputation.

628
00:49:09,599 --> 00:49:11,474
Have you met with Tonix?

629
00:49:13,806 --> 00:49:16,178
My brother wants us to go back to Diablo.

630
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:19,812
So he'll back us up against Aztec.

631
00:49:20,318 --> 00:49:21,318
No.

632
00:49:22,112 --> 00:49:23,677
We're not going back to Diablo.

633
00:49:24,489 --> 00:49:25,532
What about the Aztecs?

634
00:49:26,724 --> 00:49:28,285
Those milk-drinking punks.

635
00:49:29,202 --> 00:49:30,724
We can take 'em.

636
00:49:34,263 --> 00:49:36,167
Holy shit! Exciting!

637
00:49:36,369 --> 00:49:38,872
My pal's got a hard-on.

638
00:49:40,820 --> 00:49:44,282
But our war with the Aztecs
will not be taking place.

639
00:49:47,595 --> 00:49:51,349
Pons turned down Tonix' offer
to go back to Diablo.

640
00:49:51,766 --> 00:49:53,833
Tonix didn't like that.

641
00:49:55,854 --> 00:49:57,539
Fuck, this is it! We should go!

642
00:49:57,564 --> 00:50:00,380
And to make an example of them,

643
00:50:00,504 --> 00:50:03,132
the Diablos raided Aztec's territory.

644
00:50:03,778 --> 00:50:05,155
Join the Diablos.

645
00:50:06,441 --> 00:50:07,693
Please don't hurt me!

646
00:50:08,033 --> 00:50:09,284
That so?

647
00:50:12,203 --> 00:50:15,290
Hit him hard, Tonix! Kill him!

648
00:50:28,511 --> 00:50:30,638
Where'd you pick up these suckers?

649
00:50:31,681 --> 00:50:33,641
They look like
they're Shin's internet shop rats.

650
00:50:34,204 --> 00:50:36,081
They're just a bunch of squirts.

651
00:50:38,188 --> 00:50:39,272
How old are you?

652
00:50:42,083 --> 00:50:43,960
The Supremo just asked you a question.

653
00:50:44,015 --> 00:50:45,624
- Answer him!
- Fifteen, sir.

654
00:50:45,765 --> 00:50:49,075
This one thinks
he can speak in English!

655
00:50:49,491 --> 00:50:51,868
They won't even pass as snatchers!

656
00:50:51,868 --> 00:50:54,537
It's all cool, Tonix. Fresh blood.

657
00:50:56,206 --> 00:50:57,374
That's twenty thousand worth.

658
00:50:58,208 --> 00:51:00,001
You fucker. Don't even
think about cheating me.

659
00:51:00,001 --> 00:51:01,127
Fuck if I dare, man.

660
00:51:02,170 --> 00:51:04,255
Tonix is here. Tell Kiko.

661
00:51:09,552 --> 00:51:11,221
Heaven or hell?

662
00:51:11,429 --> 00:51:12,597
Heaven, ma'am!

663
00:51:13,098 --> 00:51:15,350
Me, too. I choose heaven.

664
00:51:32,117 --> 00:51:33,660
How much did we get today?

665
00:51:34,536 --> 00:51:35,620
Fifty.

666
00:51:39,848 --> 00:51:41,157
This should do.

667
00:51:41,205 --> 00:51:42,660
We're break even.

668
00:51:56,266 --> 00:51:59,477
Chief: I still have three kilograms.
I'll leave it to you.

669
00:52:05,191 --> 00:52:06,234
Take your shirt off.

670
00:54:11,985 --> 00:54:12,985
Drink it!

671
00:54:26,791 --> 00:54:28,153
Bottoms up!

672
00:54:28,943 --> 00:54:29,943
Bite it!

673
00:54:31,588 --> 00:54:34,549
Was the change good for Diablo?

674
00:54:35,049 --> 00:54:36,049
No, sir!

675
00:54:55,434 --> 00:54:58,934
Was the change good for Diablo?

676
00:55:00,825 --> 00:55:01,634
Answer me!

677
00:55:01,659 --> 00:55:03,911
Yes, sir! Yes, sir!

678
00:55:04,621 --> 00:55:05,955
Yes, sir!

679
00:55:17,573 --> 00:55:18,908
I congratulate you.

680
00:55:33,079 --> 00:55:34,200
What do you want?

681
00:55:35,360 --> 00:55:36,611
Just come out and say it.

682
00:55:37,028 --> 00:55:38,279
That's what we want.

683
00:55:42,367 --> 00:55:45,995
Eat up. Their Deep-fried
Pork Belly is really good.

684
00:55:46,996 --> 00:55:48,581
Remember when we were kids?

685
00:55:48,873 --> 00:55:51,000
Papa used to bring us here all the time.

686
00:55:51,376 --> 00:55:53,503
Especially when he scored a lot of cash.

687
00:55:54,212 --> 00:55:57,215
I know it's your favorite. Go ahead.

688
00:56:04,514 --> 00:56:05,598
You still have that.

689
00:56:07,266 --> 00:56:10,726
Papa gave you that because you're a girl.

690
00:56:11,521 --> 00:56:12,855
For your protection.

691
00:56:13,695 --> 00:56:15,488
But are you feeding it?

692
00:56:15,948 --> 00:56:20,719
That amulet needs to be
prayed over to be any good.

693
00:56:25,034 --> 00:56:27,453
We're not going back to Diablo.

694
00:56:27,453 --> 00:56:31,416
I'm talking to my sister, you fuck.

695
00:56:31,441 --> 00:56:32,964
Don't be a dick.

696
00:56:33,209 --> 00:56:36,379
Can you calm down, both of you?

697
00:56:38,631 --> 00:56:41,050
You're on the top of our list.

698
00:56:41,467 --> 00:56:43,928
Because I know you'll refuse my offer.

699
00:56:44,150 --> 00:56:46,221
I don't want to drag my sister into this.

700
00:56:46,597 --> 00:56:47,682
She's family.

701
00:56:49,267 --> 00:56:50,977
Papa left her in my care.

702
00:56:51,728 --> 00:56:54,063
That's why I went after Pon's group first.

703
00:56:55,273 --> 00:56:57,692
It might help you change your mind.

704
00:56:59,527 --> 00:57:01,003
I've made up my mind.

705
00:57:01,028 --> 00:57:02,286
You've made up your mind?

706
00:57:04,200 --> 00:57:06,698
Yes. That's my decision.

707
00:57:07,366 --> 00:57:08,366
Are you deaf?

708
00:57:10,762 --> 00:57:12,496
Why are you doing this, big bro?

709
00:57:13,249 --> 00:57:15,293
Why did you call us here?

710
00:57:15,960 --> 00:57:19,505
I won't force you
to come back into the fold.

711
00:57:20,381 --> 00:57:23,176
If you wanna run your own joint, fine.

712
00:57:24,163 --> 00:57:26,246
But I want you to be my business partners.

713
00:57:27,013 --> 00:57:28,013
Partners?

714
00:57:30,391 --> 00:57:31,601
You have a business?

715
00:57:32,175 --> 00:57:33,557
I have a backer.

716
00:57:33,728 --> 00:57:35,396
He's the one who got me out of jail.

717
00:57:35,675 --> 00:57:39,122
But I need to work for him.

718
00:57:42,445 --> 00:57:44,822
What's that?
You're someone's bitch now, too?

719
00:57:46,157 --> 00:57:47,157
Bullet.

720
00:57:48,618 --> 00:57:50,912
You want to control the whole sitio.

721
00:57:53,790 --> 00:57:58,184
I supply the whole place.

722
00:57:58,586 --> 00:57:59,586
Meth.

723
00:58:01,047 --> 00:58:02,934
That's why you attacked Pons.

724
00:58:03,466 --> 00:58:06,379
They're my competition both in territory...

725
00:58:07,334 --> 00:58:08,949
and in business.

726
00:58:10,167 --> 00:58:11,419
Bro, why us?

727
00:58:12,016 --> 00:58:18,147
Aina, I trust you.
We're one blood. Diablo.

728
00:58:19,899 --> 00:58:23,903
And Bullet? Of course, he's my favorite.

729
00:58:24,237 --> 00:58:27,542
- I know him inside out.
- Then what?

730
00:58:28,644 --> 00:58:32,659
You get what I get.

731
00:58:33,222 --> 00:58:35,135
50-50.

732
00:58:35,873 --> 00:58:37,083
And if we refuse?

733
00:58:40,002 --> 00:58:44,340
I'm doing everything
I can to avoid a clash.

734
00:58:44,827 --> 00:58:47,050
I'm sharing my kingdom with you.

735
00:58:48,219 --> 00:58:50,386
Why are you acting all toughshit?

736
00:58:51,681 --> 00:58:53,266
- Bro, just leave us out...
- Don't call me bro.

737
00:58:53,291 --> 00:58:54,333
Watch it, motherfucker!

738
00:58:56,420 --> 00:58:57,420
Bullet.

739
00:58:59,553 --> 00:59:01,495
Think carefully, Bullet.

740
00:59:02,613 --> 00:59:07,080
Because next time,
I won't give a shit about family.

741
00:59:10,074 --> 00:59:11,074
Aina.

742
00:59:20,459 --> 00:59:21,459
Bullet.

743
00:59:22,474 --> 00:59:24,175
Bullet, wait.

744
00:59:25,256 --> 00:59:27,254
Your brother's a son of a bitch.

745
00:59:27,758 --> 00:59:29,551
I'll finish that fucking monster.

746
00:59:32,210 --> 00:59:35,753
Bullet, we need to discuss this
with the group.

747
00:59:36,955 --> 00:59:38,636
You're considering his offer?

748
00:59:40,121 --> 00:59:42,815
Bullet, he's my family.

749
00:59:43,774 --> 00:59:44,774
Family?

750
00:59:45,318 --> 00:59:47,465
He treats you like a doormat.

751
00:59:48,487 --> 00:59:50,114
We're free from Diablo.

752
00:59:52,575 --> 00:59:54,386
We're free from your family.

753
00:59:55,328 --> 00:59:57,622
We don't need to
feed off of their palms, anymore.

754
00:59:57,647 --> 00:59:58,898
Those days are over.

755
01:00:00,627 --> 01:00:03,668
I'm done being your brother's lackey.

756
01:00:04,795 --> 01:00:06,589
I'm done with all his shit.

757
01:00:08,549 --> 01:00:10,488
You can't force me to go back.

758
01:00:14,931 --> 01:00:15,931
Bullet.

759
01:00:17,099 --> 01:00:19,222
I'm not asking you to go back.

760
01:00:20,311 --> 01:00:24,982
I just think it should be
the whole group's decision.

761
01:00:25,816 --> 01:00:29,528
Whatever we agree on, I'll honor that.

762
01:00:32,156 --> 01:00:34,909
Bullet, you're the only family I have left.

763
01:00:49,736 --> 01:00:51,816
What took you so fucking long!

764
01:00:52,551 --> 01:00:53,897
Had to talk to someone.

765
01:01:02,979 --> 01:01:04,563
There should be two million in here.

766
01:01:04,730 --> 01:01:05,898
Why are you missing 500?

767
01:01:06,899 --> 01:01:09,691
We haven't picked up the cash from Trese.

768
01:01:10,319 --> 01:01:12,196
You said you're all good.

769
01:01:13,661 --> 01:01:15,793
That group is a little tough to crack.

770
01:01:16,096 --> 01:01:17,405
You know what, Tonix?

771
01:01:17,472 --> 01:01:19,057
I don't want to hear

772
01:01:19,143 --> 01:01:21,910
how much bigger of an asshole
than you that motherfucker is.

773
01:01:22,456 --> 01:01:24,347
A deal is a deal.

774
01:01:25,001 --> 01:01:26,754
- You understand?
- Yes.

775
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:28,920
Yes!

776
01:01:37,221 --> 01:01:38,221
Sell all of that.

777
01:01:39,098 --> 01:01:41,892
Remember. You'd better complete
your payments by Sunday.

778
01:01:47,102 --> 01:01:48,168
Sure, boss.

779
01:01:50,526 --> 01:01:52,793
The Diablos are offering an alliance.

780
01:01:55,656 --> 01:01:57,652
But I'm going to kill the Diablos.

781
01:02:01,162 --> 01:02:02,872
Now, I understand...

782
01:02:05,082 --> 01:02:06,527
if you can't fight.

783
01:02:07,126 --> 01:02:08,294
But I'm asking you

784
01:02:09,754 --> 01:02:10,754
don't

785
01:02:11,714 --> 01:02:13,674
even plan on turning
your backs against us.

786
01:02:15,134 --> 01:02:16,635
Because I'll fight you head to head.

787
01:02:16,927 --> 01:02:19,767
Bullet, we're not gonna
fucking do that to you.

788
01:02:19,792 --> 01:02:20,792
You know that.

789
01:02:21,515 --> 01:02:22,641
We're one.

790
01:02:27,605 --> 01:02:31,090
Fight! We're gonna kill those fuckers!

791
01:02:38,032 --> 01:02:40,618
This one's got good quality!

792
01:02:42,286 --> 01:02:45,289
- I'll take care of this son.
- I hope this doesn't stop.

793
01:02:45,314 --> 01:02:46,699
You bet.

794
01:02:48,136 --> 01:02:51,389
There's more... here, here.

795
01:02:51,545 --> 01:02:52,545
Here. Here's for you.

796
01:02:53,676 --> 01:02:56,386
Give that to Eleven.
They know what to do.

797
01:02:56,592 --> 01:02:57,885
Come right back, you hear?

798
01:03:00,765 --> 01:03:02,425
These are good stuff, son.

799
01:03:03,974 --> 01:03:08,629
- I hope we sell a lot today, Ma.
- Yeah. Leave it to me.

800
01:03:11,565 --> 01:03:13,150
You heard from Aina yet?

801
01:03:33,504 --> 01:03:34,744
Are you having second thoughts?

802
01:03:38,128 --> 01:03:39,783
I'm thinking about Aina.

803
01:03:40,803 --> 01:03:42,680
She's still one of ours, Ma.

804
01:03:44,056 --> 01:03:45,056
You're my only family.

805
01:03:46,308 --> 01:03:47,852
Aina's no child of mine.

806
01:03:49,603 --> 01:03:53,607
She's from a fuck-who-knows
whore your father knocked up.

807
01:03:58,445 --> 01:04:01,866
Tonix. You can't doubt yourself.

808
01:04:04,743 --> 01:04:05,743
If you do that,

809
01:04:08,164 --> 01:04:10,124
they'll second guess your words.

810
01:04:11,167 --> 01:04:13,377
Words are a king's power.

811
01:04:15,588 --> 01:04:18,424
If you soften up and give way to Aina,

812
01:04:19,842 --> 01:04:21,886
your word will lose its potency.

813
01:04:23,012 --> 01:04:24,847
And you might lose your throne.

814
01:04:26,473 --> 01:04:27,808
Ma's right.

815
01:04:28,726 --> 01:04:30,728
You need to enforce the rules.

816
01:04:31,770 --> 01:04:33,272
Family or not.

817
01:04:39,528 --> 01:04:41,238
Don't get involved in this trouble.

818
01:04:41,864 --> 01:04:45,551
Tch, sis. We're Illustrado.
We're up in arms.

819
01:04:45,576 --> 01:04:47,529
We'll die as Illustrados.

820
01:04:47,870 --> 01:04:48,870
You can't.

821
01:04:49,681 --> 01:04:52,310
I don't want to bury
my Illustrado brothers.

822
01:04:52,525 --> 01:04:53,998
Especially not the two of you.

823
01:04:55,169 --> 01:04:56,962
Choose your future.

824
01:04:58,964 --> 01:05:00,090
And you Askal.

825
01:05:00,650 --> 01:05:03,169
Your grandma told me
you have a scholarship.

826
01:05:04,678 --> 01:05:05,678
Keep that.

827
01:05:07,097 --> 01:05:08,974
If you can, you should leave this place.

828
01:05:09,975 --> 01:05:12,645
Don't wait for the fight to break out.

829
01:05:12,645 --> 01:05:15,940
Pfft. The hell, sis?
It's like you don't even know us.

830
01:05:16,148 --> 01:05:19,877
We can take them on. We're badasses.
You can ask Askal.

831
01:05:19,902 --> 01:05:22,613
I even gutted one of
the Aztecs just the other day.

832
01:05:22,638 --> 01:05:24,381
I let the fucker bleed out right here.

833
01:05:24,406 --> 01:05:28,702
- He's dead, dude. Dead as fuck.
- I don't remember anything like that.

834
01:05:28,727 --> 01:05:29,727
That's enough.

835
01:05:31,080 --> 01:05:33,614
It's better if you left this place.

836
01:05:35,209 --> 01:05:36,669
How are we gonna do that?

837
01:05:37,044 --> 01:05:39,059
We don't have a life outside the sitio.

838
01:05:39,213 --> 01:05:42,925
If I leave, I'll just go
back to being a homeless bum.

839
01:05:44,593 --> 01:05:49,431
If I'll die anyway,
I'd rather do it fighting with you.

840
01:05:50,349 --> 01:05:52,101
Garong's right, sis.

841
01:05:52,559 --> 01:05:55,729
Everyone who's from
here are destined to die here.

842
01:05:56,230 --> 01:05:58,065
Nobody gets out of this place alive.

843
01:05:58,090 --> 01:05:59,383
Faster Toks!

844
01:06:13,497 --> 01:06:14,581
Son of a bitch!

845
01:06:14,581 --> 01:06:17,001
We'll have our revenge on him!

846
01:06:17,376 --> 01:06:18,419
Toks, hurry up!

847
01:06:19,378 --> 01:06:20,378
Hurry up!

848
01:06:39,648 --> 01:06:40,733
Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!

849
01:06:42,901 --> 01:06:44,987
- You motherfucker!
- Hurry, get him inside!

850
01:06:47,489 --> 01:06:50,868
You motherfucker!
Hurry up, man!

851
01:07:40,459 --> 01:07:42,628
- Fuck!
- You think you can get away?

852
01:07:42,628 --> 01:07:45,297
You motherfucker. Stop moving!

853
01:07:45,881 --> 01:07:47,007
Let me go!

854
01:07:47,716 --> 01:07:48,842
Let me go!

855
01:08:10,114 --> 01:08:11,824
Shut your fucking mouth!

856
01:08:13,617 --> 01:08:15,327
I didn't do anything!

857
01:08:26,380 --> 01:08:27,464
You son of a bitch!

858
01:08:32,052 --> 01:08:33,846
You talk too fucking much!

859
01:08:40,394 --> 01:08:41,645
You fucking loudmouth!

860
01:09:04,835 --> 01:09:05,878
Thanks.

861
01:09:07,171 --> 01:09:08,464
Let's have a taste.

862
01:09:12,217 --> 01:09:14,720
Yum. You're a good cook.

863
01:09:42,789 --> 01:09:43,789
Hey.

864
01:09:45,584 --> 01:09:46,584
You okay?

865
01:09:50,547 --> 01:09:51,590
Are you pregnant?

866
01:09:54,391 --> 01:09:56,678
My period's two-month's late.

867
01:10:09,024 --> 01:10:10,024
Bullet.

868
01:10:11,944 --> 01:10:12,944
It's Garong.

869
01:10:50,232 --> 01:10:52,568
Bullet. I found this
on the other side of the bank.

870
01:11:24,151 --> 01:11:26,027
To defeat the Diablos,

871
01:11:26,850 --> 01:11:29,477
you need to be
more cunning than they are.

872
01:11:29,502 --> 01:11:31,815
Let me go! Hey! What the fuck!

873
01:11:31,815 --> 01:11:34,705
First, we needed to get on Tonix nerves.

874
01:11:36,278 --> 01:11:40,030
So we went after his business first.

875
01:11:40,782 --> 01:11:44,642
We bullied and intimidated
his little henchmen.

876
01:11:54,588 --> 01:11:57,174
We knew the Diablos would come after us.

877
01:11:57,509 --> 01:12:01,033
So we came up with a plan.

878
01:12:09,019 --> 01:12:10,604
Fuck. Nobody's here.

879
01:12:10,812 --> 01:12:12,064
They got us again.

880
01:12:13,213 --> 01:12:16,049
We needed to keep moving spots

881
01:12:16,074 --> 01:12:18,902
to confuse them about our location.

882
01:12:19,110 --> 01:12:23,448
That way, they won't know
when and where we'll strike.

883
01:12:23,473 --> 01:12:26,220
We could have gotten back at them. Shit.

884
01:12:28,511 --> 01:12:31,181
Bullet named the group Illustrado

885
01:12:31,514 --> 01:12:33,324
because he believes

886
01:12:33,349 --> 01:12:38,588
that it will bring the light
into this nest of demons.

887
01:12:38,764 --> 01:12:41,705
Fuck you! I'll break your fucking skull!

888
01:12:41,908 --> 01:12:45,963
This light will illuminate
everything and open our eyes.

889
01:12:48,072 --> 01:12:52,939
Huh? And this loose chin of yours?
I'll make it into sour soup!

890
01:12:53,007 --> 01:12:55,760
I'll have your buddies chew on it,
even your aunts, and your...

891
01:12:56,111 --> 01:12:58,541
Fuck you! You're driving me nuts!

892
01:12:58,900 --> 01:13:02,128
Fuck y'all. I don't care
if you gang up on me.

893
01:13:02,153 --> 01:13:03,738
The fuck did you say?

894
01:13:03,763 --> 01:13:05,807
- I don't care if you gang up on me!
- Fuck you!

895
01:13:07,556 --> 01:13:08,983
Fuck you!

896
01:13:09,227 --> 01:13:12,205
This one's for Garong. Fuck you!

897
01:13:14,932 --> 01:13:16,934
You son of a bitch. You should be gutted.

898
01:13:21,772 --> 01:13:25,150
It's easy to kill the Diablos.

899
01:13:25,191 --> 01:13:26,651
This one's for Garong.

900
01:13:43,736 --> 01:13:46,113
Dump him in the river.

901
01:13:54,763 --> 01:13:56,014
Blankets, sis.

902
01:13:56,939 --> 01:13:58,691
If you need anything, just holler.

903
01:13:59,254 --> 01:14:00,339
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

904
01:14:19,621 --> 01:14:21,123
Is there a problem?

905
01:14:30,048 --> 01:14:31,550
I'm just thinking about you.

906
01:14:32,968 --> 01:14:33,968
And about our...

907
01:14:36,263 --> 01:14:37,556
About our child.

908
01:14:44,732 --> 01:14:46,859
What if you get away for a while?

909
01:14:46,906 --> 01:14:50,011
Bring Grandma Edna with you and Askal.

910
01:14:51,100 --> 01:14:54,771
If I'm leaving, it'll be with you.

911
01:14:56,450 --> 01:14:58,035
But that's impossible.

912
01:14:59,828 --> 01:15:02,414
I can't leave Macoy
and the others in this battle.

913
01:15:06,911 --> 01:15:07,912
Don't worry.

914
01:15:13,383 --> 01:15:15,052
Nothing bad's going to happen to me.

915
01:15:18,847 --> 01:15:21,224
You're just saying that to calm me down.

916
01:15:27,898 --> 01:15:28,899
Aina.

917
01:15:33,946 --> 01:15:35,405
I love you very much.

918
01:15:38,116 --> 01:15:40,619
And I can't possibly sacrifice you

919
01:15:43,538 --> 01:15:48,377
and our child. For what?
Just for this stupid war?

920
01:15:50,963 --> 01:15:52,089
So please...

921
01:15:54,383 --> 01:15:55,425
listen to me.

922
01:16:18,240 --> 01:16:19,950
My father told me

923
01:16:22,035 --> 01:16:24,955
that this came from
his grandfather who was a soldier.

924
01:16:27,624 --> 01:16:31,237
Did you know that St. James is
the patron saint of soldiers in Spain?

925
01:16:33,296 --> 01:16:36,216
He watches over all the soldiers in a war.

926
01:16:37,342 --> 01:16:38,342
In that case,

927
01:16:40,512 --> 01:16:41,763
I won't die.

928
01:16:43,098 --> 01:16:45,809
This is the only connection
I have left with my family.

929
01:16:47,019 --> 01:16:48,729
With my father's love for me.

930
01:16:50,363 --> 01:16:53,199
This medallion has kept me
safe all these years.

931
01:16:54,317 --> 01:16:56,236
You just have to trust it, too.

932
01:17:22,888 --> 01:17:24,723
Are you guys doing all right?

933
01:17:27,517 --> 01:17:28,517
Where were you?

934
01:17:29,019 --> 01:17:30,604
Just went out for some fresh air.

935
01:17:30,979 --> 01:17:32,481
You're a father now, Benny.

936
01:17:33,056 --> 01:17:35,817
You can't still be joining
gang wars like a clueless teenager.

937
01:17:36,823 --> 01:17:37,823
Mona.

938
01:17:38,116 --> 01:17:39,116
This'll be the last.

939
01:17:41,551 --> 01:17:43,344
I just need to look after Andi.

940
01:17:43,429 --> 01:17:45,473
How old do you think
your brother is, Benny?

941
01:17:45,567 --> 01:17:47,110
He's old enough.

942
01:17:47,518 --> 01:17:49,979
Why don't you worry
about your own kids for a change?

943
01:17:51,170 --> 01:17:53,381
Besides, your brother's a maniac.

944
01:17:53,840 --> 01:17:56,759
Right, he's a little crazed.

945
01:17:56,759 --> 01:17:58,761
That's why I've got to keep an eye on him.

946
01:18:04,893 --> 01:18:05,935
Mona.

947
01:18:07,020 --> 01:18:09,230
Mama asked me to take care of him.

948
01:18:10,123 --> 01:18:12,584
I don't want to break my promise to them.

949
01:18:12,609 --> 01:18:14,819
I hope you get that.

950
01:18:15,278 --> 01:18:17,197
I'm Andi's only family.

951
01:18:19,324 --> 01:18:22,702
This is the last time. I've had enough.

952
01:18:48,311 --> 01:18:49,311
Bullet.

953
01:18:49,520 --> 01:18:52,649
These are the boys who want
to fight the Diablos with us.

954
01:19:01,866 --> 01:19:05,119
I don't think these punks
are ready to fight to the death.

955
01:19:05,328 --> 01:19:07,497
Allies don't grow on trees, Bullet.

956
01:19:14,963 --> 01:19:17,131
The fuck is this?
You bring me milk drinkers?

957
01:19:37,318 --> 01:19:38,704
They're too green.

958
01:20:01,384 --> 01:20:04,137
Okay, you know what to do.
Pull down your shorts!

959
01:20:04,743 --> 01:20:07,300
Yeah? Then I'll kneel.

960
01:20:07,390 --> 01:20:09,183
Then you jump into the water.

961
01:20:09,208 --> 01:20:10,808
Did you think I'd put those in my mouth?

962
01:20:11,878 --> 01:20:14,714
I will promote programs

963
01:20:15,757 --> 01:20:20,178
that will promote a bright future
for our youth.

964
01:20:21,446 --> 01:20:26,451
Programs that will keep
them away from drugs and violence.

965
01:20:27,285 --> 01:20:29,971
You drug addicts prowling our streets…

966
01:20:29,996 --> 01:20:33,224
Drugs addicts,
wherever rat hole you're hiding

967
01:20:33,249 --> 01:20:35,501
out on the streets or in your houses...

968
01:20:35,501 --> 01:20:37,533
I will not be selective.

969
01:20:38,087 --> 01:20:39,255
I will come find you.

970
01:20:40,048 --> 01:20:41,841
The entire police force

971
01:20:41,841 --> 01:20:46,888
is behind this program
to eradicate and dismantle you.

972
01:20:46,913 --> 01:20:56,103
the addicts of this sitio under
the administration of Mayor Magdangal.

973
01:20:56,981 --> 01:20:58,900
Go to Aina's.

974
01:20:58,925 --> 01:21:00,775
Bro, I'm ready for this.

975
01:21:03,362 --> 01:21:04,889
Bro, I can do this.

976
01:21:05,061 --> 01:21:07,925
This still isn't your fight, bro.
Get out of here.

977
01:21:07,950 --> 01:21:08,950
Macoy!

978
01:21:10,382 --> 01:21:14,444
I know it's not easy for you
to leave this place.

979
01:21:14,540 --> 01:21:18,127
Your brother and your boyfriend
are out to kill each other.

980
01:21:18,981 --> 01:21:23,026
But I'm telling you,
whomever of them wins,

981
01:21:23,594 --> 01:21:25,978
nothing will change in the sitio.

982
01:21:27,466 --> 01:21:33,013
As long as the politicians
don't take us seriously,

983
01:21:33,550 --> 01:21:38,597
and see us only
as numbers in their ballots,

984
01:21:39,478 --> 01:21:42,565
people will remain poor.

985
01:21:43,357 --> 01:21:48,821
And because of that poverty,
crime and violence will keep thriving.

986
01:21:49,530 --> 01:21:51,699
You're making the right decision.

987
01:21:52,491 --> 01:21:56,287
No child should be born
in this cursed place.

988
01:22:14,976 --> 01:22:16,686
Askal, take care of your grandma.

989
01:22:17,527 --> 01:22:19,267
I won't leave you here, sis.

990
01:22:37,244 --> 01:22:39,788
Who told you we'll pass through here? Huh?

991
01:22:40,914 --> 01:22:42,333
Macoy did!

992
01:23:02,637 --> 01:23:04,138
Give me back Aina.

993
01:23:04,938 --> 01:23:06,648
And I'll let you back into Diablo.

994
01:23:07,024 --> 01:23:08,609
Just don't hurt her.

995
01:23:09,797 --> 01:23:12,717
She's my sister.
Why would I hurt her?

996
01:23:21,914 --> 01:23:24,850
Askal. Take care of your grandma.

997
01:23:24,875 --> 01:23:25,875
Got it?

998
01:23:27,294 --> 01:23:29,546
- Get out of here!
- Aina!

999
01:23:30,124 --> 01:23:31,125
Let's go, Grandma.

1000
01:23:52,069 --> 01:23:53,695
I've been waiting for you.

1001
01:24:56,353 --> 01:25:00,345
These fucking snakes
are out of their nest.

1002
01:25:00,370 --> 01:25:04,333
- Look at you, you big fat ballsack!
- Fuck you! Shut up!

1003
01:25:06,668 --> 01:25:08,704
- You fucker!
- You son of a bitch!

1004
01:25:09,849 --> 01:25:12,635
You're really asking for it!

1005
01:25:14,067 --> 01:25:15,235
Bullet!

1006
01:25:23,619 --> 01:25:24,619
Bro!

1007
01:25:26,705 --> 01:25:28,665
Here comes! Get ready!

1008
01:25:47,935 --> 01:25:49,773
Hey! You're not
supposed to be here, Aina!

1009
01:25:49,797 --> 01:25:51,438
Fuck you! You snake!

1010
01:25:54,191 --> 01:25:56,532
- I only did it because...
- Because you're a coward!

1011
01:25:56,557 --> 01:25:57,975
Because I want to save you.

1012
01:26:00,864 --> 01:26:02,282
I love you, Aina.

1013
01:26:03,617 --> 01:26:05,536
You betrayed us. Traitor!

1014
01:26:14,378 --> 01:26:15,378
Sons of bitches!

1015
01:26:27,432 --> 01:26:28,432
Bro!

1016
01:26:30,227 --> 01:26:31,478
Fuck you!

1017
01:26:36,692 --> 01:26:38,201
Fuck you!

1018
01:26:40,404 --> 01:26:41,404
Bro!

1019
01:26:42,739 --> 01:26:44,241
I'm sorry, Ma.

1020
01:26:44,608 --> 01:26:48,154
Hey. Hey. Fight it, bro.

1021
01:26:48,579 --> 01:26:49,579
Bro!

1022
01:26:50,550 --> 01:26:51,706
Bro!

1023
01:26:52,082 --> 01:26:53,959
You motherfucker.

1024
01:26:54,811 --> 01:26:56,229
Bro!

1025
01:26:57,183 --> 01:26:58,463
You little bitch!

1026
01:27:30,037 --> 01:27:30,454
Hey.

1027
01:27:30,829 --> 01:27:31,246
What is it?

1028
01:27:31,580 --> 01:27:33,206
Sir, there's a street fight over there.

1029
01:27:38,670 --> 01:27:42,007
Holy fuck, you sure made
the wrong fucking choice.

1030
01:27:42,466 --> 01:27:46,345
I gave you a chance but you blew it.

1031
01:27:46,803 --> 01:27:48,388
You should have just left us alone.

1032
01:27:48,805 --> 01:27:49,931
Fuck you.

1033
01:27:49,931 --> 01:27:52,851
You son of a bitch.
Andi's blood is on you.

1034
01:27:56,063 --> 01:27:57,147
Fuck you.

1035
01:28:00,567 --> 01:28:01,652
Show me what you got!

1036
01:28:02,611 --> 01:28:04,446
You're weak!

1037
01:28:06,490 --> 01:28:07,490
Asshole!

1038
01:28:13,538 --> 01:28:14,538
Huh?

1039
01:28:18,126 --> 01:28:19,336
Motherfucker!

1040
01:28:20,796 --> 01:28:24,299
What? Huh?

1041
01:28:33,392 --> 01:28:34,601
Fuck you!

1042
01:28:40,148 --> 01:28:41,960
Fuck you!

1043
01:29:04,812 --> 01:29:06,257
Bullet!

1044
01:29:20,280 --> 01:29:21,793
What a fucking mess.

1045
01:29:22,566 --> 01:29:23,692
Clean that up.

1046
01:29:44,796 --> 01:29:47,335
Goddamnit, Tonix.
You're a fucking idiot.

1047
01:29:52,512 --> 01:29:53,597
Clean it all up.

1048
01:29:55,640 --> 01:29:57,851
All right, shooting's over.

1049
01:29:58,018 --> 01:29:59,478
You can go back to your rat holes!

1050
01:30:16,703 --> 01:30:17,703
Bullet.

1051
01:30:22,250 --> 01:30:23,668
Fuck you!

1052
01:30:33,637 --> 01:30:34,637
Bullet.

1053
01:30:42,395 --> 01:30:43,438
Get away from here.

1054
01:30:43,463 --> 01:30:48,067
No, Bullet. I can still heal you.

1055
01:30:48,151 --> 01:30:52,489
There's nothing more we can do.
There's nothing more we can do.

1056
01:30:53,031 --> 01:30:54,074
It's over.

1057
01:30:55,992 --> 01:30:57,744
You should leave.
Don't even come back here.

1058
01:30:59,454 --> 01:31:01,957
If our children grow up someplace else,

1059
01:31:04,835 --> 01:31:07,003
they won't end up like us.

1060
01:31:07,003 --> 01:31:09,756
They'll be free. Fuck, you should go now.

1061
01:31:11,341 --> 01:31:12,425
You should fucking go.

1062
01:31:15,262 --> 01:31:16,513
I love you so much.

1063
01:31:16,805 --> 01:31:18,056
I love you so much.

1064
01:31:29,985 --> 01:31:31,236
Sorry.

1065
01:31:31,403 --> 01:31:33,905
You don't belong here. Get away.

1066
01:31:35,782 --> 01:31:37,576
Fuck...

1067
01:31:42,247 --> 01:31:43,247
Leave!

1068
01:31:44,916 --> 01:31:47,252
Fucking leave. Leave me.

1069
01:31:47,794 --> 01:31:48,794
Bullet…

1070
01:31:49,754 --> 01:31:53,425
Leave. Leave right now.

1071
01:32:19,576 --> 01:32:21,828
One day, I'll make my own group.

1072
01:32:22,954 --> 01:32:24,414
And I'll make you queen.

1073
01:32:25,999 --> 01:32:29,336
I'd rather not be queen
if I'm to reign in this place.

1074
01:32:29,836 --> 01:32:32,088
I don't want to be
the queen of this shithole.

1075
01:32:32,505 --> 01:32:33,705
Where do you want to be queen?

1076
01:32:35,342 --> 01:32:36,468
Somewhere far.

1077
01:32:37,469 --> 01:32:39,387
Where our children

1078
01:32:40,055 --> 01:32:43,350
won't become drug-addicts, thieves…

1079
01:32:43,850 --> 01:32:46,394
Our kids will play in a clean ocean.

1080
01:32:47,640 --> 01:32:52,525
Or run around in this sitio.
A new sitio. A new world.

1081
01:32:53,920 --> 01:32:56,172
No rich people, no poor people…

1082
01:32:56,738 --> 01:32:58,448
Everybody's equal.

1083
01:34:31,341 --> 01:34:32,882
So, how's the mess?

1084
01:34:33,251 --> 01:34:35,512
Have you cleaned up Sitio Diablo?

1085
01:34:37,464 --> 01:34:41,342
Those Diablos were pests.
Their enemy gangs, too.

1086
01:34:42,510 --> 01:34:45,096
They've disrupted our operations.

1087
01:34:46,473 --> 01:34:50,101
Well, mayor, that's why
we wiped them all out.

1088
01:34:50,477 --> 01:34:52,437
So we can start from the beginning.

1089
01:34:52,697 --> 01:34:54,407
I left one gang to roam.

1090
01:34:54,647 --> 01:34:56,047
They shouldn't be too much trouble.

1091
01:34:56,691 --> 01:34:58,068
How much do you need?
