 "Light From the Ashes" - Cai Weize 

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:06,270
♫  Countless fireflies born from insignificance  ♫

3
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:10,090
♫  Riding the long wind to gather into a shining galaxy  ♫

♫  Clear the clouds and descend with the heat  ♫

7
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:27,380
♫  Melting ice and snow, overcoming twists and turns  ♫

8
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:31,250
♫  Finally at this moment of peak  ♫

9
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:35,330
♫  There is a figure that coincides with the past  ♫

10
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:39,050
♫  The glory of the past that never came  ♫

11
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:42,790
♫  The pride that the future will never pass  ♫

12
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:46,530
♫  Our fingertips intertwined and condensed  ♫

13
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:50,400
♫  Into a song that ignited the battlefield  ♫

♫  The only light in an endless night  ♫

15
00:00:54,190 --> 00:00:58,010
♫  Is you and me who overcame mediocrity  ♫

00:00:58,010 --> 00:01:01,920
♫  Up on the clouds and down in the dust  ♫

17
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,730
♫  Fireflies making every effort to illuminate  ♫

18
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:09,650
♫  I came from the legend to carry on a legend  ♫

19
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:13,440
♫  Once it's disruptive, a decade of persistence won't be in vain  ♫

20
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:17,320
♫  Up on the clouds and down in the dust  ♫

21
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:21,190
♫  Fireflies making every effort to illuminate  ♫

22
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:24,570
♫  Fireflies making every effort to illuminate  ♫

23
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:27,920
   

24
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:31,120
   

25
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:39,700
Today, during the All-Star Game,

26
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:41,320
you defeated your own captain.

27
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:43,640
Anything you want to say?

28
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:47,120
I... I never thought I could win.

29
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:51,320
Captain, I'm sorry, I...

30
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,440
Yingjie,

31
00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:02,200
you need to shoulder the responsibility of Tiny Herb's future.

32
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:09,720
Let's give the two players an applause again.

33
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:10,820
Are you satisfied with your performance today?

34
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:14,720
Gao Yingjie, do you think your victory was a fluke or a result of your strength?

35
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,580
Yingjie did exceptionally well today.

36
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:18,920
He displayed his full potential.

37
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:22,180
Captain Wang Jiexi, are you really sure you didn't lose intentionally today?

38
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:23,400
That's his strength.

39
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:27,480
Player Wang Jiexi, when will you pass on your Vaccaria account card?

40
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,160
- Thank you, everyone. 
 - Player Wang Jiexi,

41
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,440
please answer the question directly. Thanks.

42
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:31,700
Captain Wang Jiexi, you...

43
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:32,680
Cap... Captain Wang Jiexi.

44
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:36,281
Do you really believe that Gao Yingjie can be the future of Tiny Herb?

45
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,800
 I believe that one day, each of you will be able to defeat me. 

46
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,000
 Today, we witnessed the whole process of 

47
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,980
 the rise and blossom of the League's new star. 

48
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:53,220
- Captain. 
  - Gao Jingjie's name 

49
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:54,321
- Are you all right, Captain? 
  - will go down 

50
00:02:54,321 --> 00:02:56,700
 in the All-Star Game's history. 

51
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:58,560
All of you are the future of Tiny Herb.

52
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,240
Sit down, everyone.

53
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:11,800
Yingjie.

54
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:14,340
I still feel like I'm dreaming.

55
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,340
How could I defeat the captain?

56
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:33,960
Yingjie, believe in yourself.

57
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:36,280
That's your strength.

58
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:42,120
Now, let's welcome the next newcomer challenger, Qiao Yifan, who is also from Tiny Herb.

59
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:44,680
I wonder what kind of exciting match he will bring us.

60
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:47,080
Let's welcome Qiao Yifan.

61
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:51,510
   

62
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:55,140
It's Yifan.

63
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:57,740
He's the one who dungeoned with you.

64
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:00,280
Is he from Tiny Herb?

65
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,860
He is...

66
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:03,440
He wants to prove himself.

67
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,640
Sorry, Captain.

68
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,660
I was going to tell you in advance,

69
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:10,680
but I really want to play once.

70
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:14,140
If you want to compete,

71
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,740
then play well.

72
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:27,680
This way.

73
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:31,290
   

74
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,300
 Good luck, Captain. 

75
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,920
 Good luck, Yebo. 

76
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:48,800
 Good luck. Good luck. 

77
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,320
 Good luck. 

78
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,320
 Good luck, Yingjie. 

79
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:56,640
 Good luck! Good luck, Team Tiny Herb! 

80
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,980
Yifan.

81
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:16,660
Yingjie.

82
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,800
He is the jungling...

83
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:37,880
What?

84
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:40,721
Nothing. I mean... Is everyone in Tiny Herb rebelling together?

85
00:05:40,721 --> 00:05:41,761
Another player from Tiny Herb.

86
00:05:41,761 --> 00:05:43,840
Qiao Yifan, also from Team Tiny Herb.

87
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,400
I wonder which exciting match he will show us today?

88
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,840
Let's welcome Qiao Yifan.

89
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:54,440
Qiao Yifan is challenging Team Void's captain,

90
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:57,860
the League's No. 1 Phantom Demon, Li Xuan.

91
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,500
He picked the wrong opponent.

92
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,600
Both of you are standing beside me now.

93
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,700
First of all, I would like to ask Yifan.

94
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:07,700
What's your feeling about challenging your senior today?

95
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:10,100
Thank you in advance for your guidance, Senior.

96
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:13,620
Good. And how about you, the senior?

97
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:14,760
Take good care of yourself.

98
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:18,760
I didn't expect sparks to fly between the two players before the game even started.

99
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:23,580
Let's now invite both players to their battle seats.

100
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:31,620
Qiao Yifan from Team Tiny Herb is using a Phantom Demon, One Inch Ash.

101
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:34,301
We know that Phantom Demons don't have much advantage in one-on-one matches.

102
00:06:34,301 --> 00:06:36,220
Their value is mainly reflected in team games.

103
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:38,320
After all, Phantom Demons are great supports.

104
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:41,281
But he's challenging Li Xuan's Crying Devil from Team Void.

105
00:06:41,281 --> 00:06:42,540
As the League's No. 1 Phantom Demon,

106
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:44,840
he is actually using a Sword Demon character instead.

107
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:48,840
I wonder how Qiao Yifan will feel once he finds out.

108
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,180
Okay. The game will begin soon.

109
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:52,240
One Inch Ash, operated by Qiao Yifan from Team Tiny Herb

110
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:55,200
versus Crying Devil, operated by Li Xuan from Team Void.

111
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,680
The map of this match is Desolate Lands.

112
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,960
It's a regular map for Ghostblades.

113
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,680
Right, if One Inch Ash can take advantage of the terrain

114
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,000
and lay out his Ghost Boundary ahead of time,

115
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,180
there's an opportunity to take the opponent down.

116
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:06,000
But he's facing the League's No. 1 Phantom Demon,

117
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,680
I'm afraid he won't give One Inch Ash such an opportunity.

118
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,980
All right, both players have entered the Desolate Lands.

119
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:11,741
Neither side attacked immediately after entering the map.

120
00:07:11,741 --> 00:07:12,920
Instead, they are surveying the terrain,

121
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:15,341
proving that Phantom Demons rely heavily on the terrain.

122
00:07:15,341 --> 00:07:17,820
That's right. Making good use of the terrain to create advantages

123
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:20,940
is particularly important for Ghostblades.

124
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:52,000
Crying Devil is taking the lead in attacking.

125
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,281
As the No. 1 Phantom Demon, he knows exactly where the weaknesses are.

126
00:07:54,281 --> 00:07:57,000
If he can attack first, he will have a great advantage.

127
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,280
One Inch Ash chose a very open terrain.

128
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:00,361
There are very few blind spots exposing him.

129
00:08:00,361 --> 00:08:02,440
He's indeed a newcomer.

130
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:05,040
He has been discovered.

131
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:07,480
Crying Devil chose not to rush directly, but to use tactical positioning instead.

132
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,860
He found One Inch Ash's blind spot

133
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:10,760
and is waiting for an opportunity.

134
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:13,920
The veteran is surely experienced.

135
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:19,140
Crying Devil made a sneak attack!

136
00:08:25,090 --> 00:08:26,480
   

137
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:29,560
Facing the League's No. 1 Phantom Demon,

138
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:32,060
Qiao Yifan seems to be completely suppressed.

139
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,080
The newcomer is barely withstanding the directed attacks.

140
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:00,160
The Phantom Demon is completely restrained by the Sword Demon.

141
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,120
We see that Qiao Yifan's HP is dropping rapidly.

142
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,540
Crying Devil's attack speed is very fast,

143
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:05,680
not giving One Inch Ash a chance to breathe at all.

144
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:18,241
Cross sidestep.

145
00:09:18,241 --> 00:09:20,740
Unexpectedly, Qiao Yifan cut Crying Devil sideways with an Assassin skill.

146
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:23,560
Nice counterattack from One Inch Ash!

147
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:25,841
He wants to find the rhythm back.

148
00:09:25,841 --> 00:09:27,760
It's an opportunity for One Inch Ash.

149
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:31,340
A feint! Crying Devil is frozen.

150
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:33,560
One Inch Ash used Ice Boundary.

151
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:35,480
He managed to trick the No. 1 Phantom Demon.

152
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:37,940
This newcomer is really something.

153
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:41,720
Yifan will win, right?

154
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:44,700
No. He'll lose.

155
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:47,740
Where are you going?

156
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:49,420
To get some fresh air.

157
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:56,800
Let's see how Crying Devil will respond.

158
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,160
Another feint. Ghost Step.

159
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,460
Crying Devil successfully broke free.

160
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:02,181
He fooled One Inch Ash and counterattacked when the other rushed forward.

161
00:10:02,181 --> 00:10:04,921
One Inch Ash is in danger. He's going to lose.

162
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:09,760
He really did it on purpose.

163
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:12,620
All hits landed on him.

164
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:13,601
One Inch Ash's HP is now zero.

165
00:10:13,601 --> 00:10:15,280
Crying Devil wins!

166
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:19,000
Let's congratulate Team Void's Li Xuan on winning the match.

167
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,260
As expected, the experience really shows. 
    

168
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:21,640
The No. 1 Phantom Demon truly deserves his name.

169
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:23,001
A newcomer is still a newcomer.

170
00:10:23,001 --> 00:10:25,120
I can't believe he challenged the best player in his profession.

171
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,740
Though Qiao Yifan was suppressed throughout the match,

172
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:29,440
he also showed us his potential.

173
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,960
Right, I think Qiao Yifan will gain a lot of understanding

174
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,960
over Phantom Demons and Sword Demons after this match.

175
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,680
Li Xuan also showed the League's No. 1 Phantom Demon's

176
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,360
superb understanding of the profession.

177
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:41,320
This game also broke the League's fastest one-on-one winning record.

178
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:43,180
Compared to the last match of the same profession,

179
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:44,961
we can see that Qiao Yifan has a long way to go.

180
00:10:44,961 --> 00:10:48,240
Let's cheer for the newcomer.

181
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:07,800
Although Qiao Yifan lost the game, facing such a powerful opponent,

182
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:10,940
I believe he has tried his best to exert all his strength.

183
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:14,820
But I still want to know how the winner, Li Xuan,

184
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:19,700
our senior, will comment on Yifan's performance.

185
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:21,800
Actually, you played quite well today,

186
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:24,280
but, unfortunately, you were playing against me.

187
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,260
Thank you, Senior.

188
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:28,780
Li Xuan. Why did you play as a Sword Demon today?

189
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:30,780
Li Xuan, Li Xuan. As Glory's No. 1 Phantom Demon,

190
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:33,400
how do you evaluate Qiao Yifan's Phantom Demon?

191
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:35,500
Ask him instead. Listen to what he thinks.

192
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,300
Player Qiao Yifan, was your fight against Li Xuan

193
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:39,040
an individual fan's behavior or a team arrangement?

194
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:41,140
Qiao Yifan, you originally played as an Assassin.

195
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:42,841
Why did you suddenly use a Phantom Demon today?

196
00:11:42,841 --> 00:11:45,240
Did you not consider the difference between your and Li Xuan's strength before the competition?

197
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:47,481
How do you feel about being the fastest loser in the newcomer competition?

198
00:11:47,481 --> 00:11:48,700
Do you think Phantom Demon suits you?

199
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:50,120
Do you think you play the Phantom Demon well?

200
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:52,990
Will you continue playing Phantom Demon after losing so badly today?

201
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,960
Sorry.

202
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:17,600
You were too reckless.

203
00:12:21,161 --> 00:12:23,820
- Senior. 
 - I know what you're thinking.

204
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:27,740
You want to use this stage to prove your ability to use Phantom Demon.

205
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:30,980
But you were too ambitious when choosing your opponent.

206
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:33,260
You only trained for one month,

207
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:35,620
and you want to challenge the No. 1 Phantom Demon?

208
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:38,000
What were you thinking?

209
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:41,440
I know he's great.

210
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,020
- I— 
 - If you're looking for guidance

211
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:44,740
and want to pay respect to a senior,

212
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:46,640
Li Xuan is indeed a good choice.

213
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:49,981
But if you're trying to show off your ability to use Demon Phantom,

214
00:12:49,981 --> 00:12:53,960
Li Xuan should be your last choice.

215
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:58,520
No one in the Glory circle knows Phantom Demon better than Li Xuan.

216
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:03,200
And you want to display your skills in front of him?

217
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:06,540
Of course, you'd be completely restrained.

218
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:10,700
Moreover, as the support,

219
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:13,160
Phantom Demon is most valuable in a team setting.

220
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:15,380
Team awareness and skills are hard to express

221
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:18,260
in such 1v1 competitions.

222
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:20,800
Plus, you have little experience,

223
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:24,300
mistakes are a matter of time.

224
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:33,100
You're still far from mastering Phantom Demon.

225
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:37,400
Glory is not as simple as you think.

226
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,200
Senior,

227
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:43,300
I just want a chance.

228
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:47,600
A chance that the captain will notice me.

229
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:49,900
Now is not the time.

230
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:51,800
Then when is?

231
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:55,590
Do I wait until I am abandoned by the team completely?

232
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:10,640
I've done everything I can.

233
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:15,100
Maybe I should have given up.

234
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,300
It's not the team or the captain

235
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:39,800
who can give up on you,

236
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,900
but you yourself.

237
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:47,000
Yifan,

238
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,200
don't question yourself.

239
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,880
You are still young.

240
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,160
There is plenty of time for further training.

241
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:55,160
Keep looking for opportunities.

242
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:07,100
Rebound if you hit rock bottom.

243
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:11,240
Never say you'll give up.

244
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:27,900
Senior, you told me not to give up,

245
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:30,400
but why did you retire?

246
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,800
I'm also looking for opportunities.

247
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:37,800
Though I am old,

248
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,900
I never thought of giving up.

249
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:44,100
After all,

250
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:47,120
no one wants to live in the shadows.

251
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:05,500
How does it feel to be sitting in the audience?

252
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:10,000
It feels great.

253
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,020
Do you want to experience it?

254
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:14,300
That day will never come.

255
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:20,400
I'm just experiencing it in advance in case I can't adapt to retirement life.

256
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:23,200
Old Han,

257
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:25,000
everyone ages.

258
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,500
Don't argue with it.

259
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:31,100
Speaking of, if I remember correctly,

260
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:33,400
you're one year older than me. Right?

261
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:43,800
You're already feeling your performance slipping, aren't you?

262
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:47,980
Have you never thought you would leave the stage one day?

263
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:51,500
I'll never give up.

264
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:54,680
 The match between Sun Xiang and Han Wenqing will begin right away. 

265
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:58,200
 I believe you all look forward to it as much as I do, right? 

266
00:17:01,081 --> 00:17:03,320
As everyone knows, Team Tyranny ended Excellent Era's dream

267
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,920
of winning four consecutive championships.

268
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:07,401
Now, with a bitter grudge, it's a battle of the strong.

269
00:17:07,401 --> 00:17:11,860
Let's first welcome Team Excellent Era's captain, Sun Xiang.

270
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:24,460
Next, let's welcome Team Tyranny's captain, Han Wenqing.

271
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:27,220
Grandmaster Han Wenqing's popularity is very high.

272
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:29,560
But Sun Xiang's popularity is not low either.

273
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:32,660
Sun Xiang was last season's Rookie of the Year. How about this year?

274
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:35,480
First year of joining the League, he has already been elected as an All-Star.

275
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:38,900
He has also inherited Grandmaster Ye Qiu's One Autumn Leaf.

276
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:40,600
His strength goes further.

277
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:44,240
Where are Sun Xiang's fans? Let me see you.

278
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:48,200
Senior King of Fighting,

279
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:51,200
it's time to step aside when you're old.

280
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,700
Is it?

281
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:54,400
You beat me before,

282
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:57,460
but only because you had an advantage using Desert Dust.

283
00:17:57,460 --> 00:17:59,700
Now, I have One Autumn Leaf.

284
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:01,800
Do you think I'll lose again?

285
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,380
We'll have to see.

286
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:06,800
We saw the two old friends greeting each other as soon as they came on stage.

287
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:09,500
But I'm also very curious about what Sun Xiang said

288
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:12,800
to Grandmaster Han Wenqing just now?

289
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:17,100
It's actually nothing important.

290
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:19,100
I just want to tell Senior King of Fighting

291
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:21,500
the purpose of my challenge is

292
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:25,980
to settle the years-long feud between Excellent Era and Tyranny,

293
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:29,820
as well as One Autumn Leaf and Desert Dust.

294
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:32,600
 I can smell the strong odor of gunpowder. 

295
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:34,540
 - War is imminent.  
 - He is so confident.

296
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:38,200
 Please take your battle seats. 

297
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:47,341
All right. Both players are logging into their accounts and entering the map.

298
00:18:47,341 --> 00:18:50,100
Sun Xiang's One Autumn Leaf versus Han Wenqing's Desert Dust.

299
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:52,780
The match is about to begin.

300
00:18:56,461 --> 00:18:58,680
It has started. We saw that there were no tactical moves at the beginning.

301
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:00,740
Both sides rushed directly to the center of the map.

302
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:02,440
Speaking of One Autumn Leaf and Desert Dust,

303
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:05,020
I believe you are all familiar with these old enemies for many years.

304
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:07,080
Each match they played left deep impressions.

305
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:12,201
I believe today's game will also be a classic match recorded in Glory's history.

306
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:18,200
We all know that Han Wenqing has a strong personality and never retreats.

307
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:20,300
The character he uses, King of Fighting Desert Dust,

308
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:23,220
is a godly character from Glory's first generation.

309
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:25,420
Sun Xiang's One Autumn Leaf

310
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:27,940
is also a godly character from Glory's first generation, known as the Battle God.

311
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:31,200
Coupled with Sun Xiang's play style, it is equally aggressive.

312
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:34,720
This match is bound to be a spectacular close-up battle.

313
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,530
 Straight Punch, Launching Kick, Soaring Tiger. 

314
00:19:36,530 --> 00:19:39,540
 Desert Dust starts without reservation, constantly attacking One Autumn Leaf fiercely. 

315
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:40,720
 One Autumn Leaf begins to fight back. 

316
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,700
 Falling Flower Palm, Dragon Tooth, followed by Draconic Crusher. 

317
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:45,200
 A series of nice combos. Both players started... 

318
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:49,600
Didn't you say that the Newcomer Challenge is just a show?

319
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:53,180
Why is Han Wenqing attacking so fiercely right now?

320
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:56,400
He's getting old. His matches are countable.

321
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,160
He has to.

322
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:02,900
I seem to recall that he's only 26.

323
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:06,860
For professional esports, 26 is already a veteran.

324
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:08,130
He just won't accept it.

325
00:20:08,130 --> 00:20:09,300
Is it wrong not to accept it?

326
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:10,840
Not exactly.

327
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:13,040
 Desert Dust has broken through the disadvantage caused by distance 

328
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:14,680
 and sent himself to One Autumn Leaf's side. 

329
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:16,860
He deserves admiration.

330
00:20:25,650 --> 00:20:27,120
   

331
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,400
 Excellent Attack-Defense transition. 

332
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,500
Why don't you learn from him,

333
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:35,120
Grandmaster Ye Qiu, who's experiencing retirement ahead of time?

334
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:37,760
 One Autumn Leaf survived it and counterattacked immediately. 

335
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:40,300
 But we can see that Desert Dust crouched to a horse stance. 

336
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:42,661
 His left hand sways in front while the right hand is subtly on his waist. 

337
00:20:42,661 --> 00:20:45,280
 This is the opening stance for the Striker's ult move, Emperor's Fist. 

338
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:48,120
I accidentally heard your conversation.

339
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:53,900
I also really want to know how it feels to sit in the audience for the first time.

340
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:58,900
 One Autumn Leaf hurriedly dodged just in time with only the fist's wind brushing by. 

341
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:00,140
It's not bad.

342
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:04,480
- Go for it, Han Wenqing! 
  - Han Wenqing, go for it! 

343
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:11,340
Have you ever wondered how you will bear Guo Guo's anger

344
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:14,741
if she one day finds out who you really are?

345
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:20,040
She won't refuse the surprise.

346
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:21,580
 I wonder if a new Battle God 

347
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:24,720
 can bring us a different kind of surprise. 

348
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:29,500
Sun Xiang's play style is very similar to Ye Qiu's.

349
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:32,500
For a moment, I feel like I'm back in the era when the Battle God

350
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:35,280
and the King of Fighting were at their peak.

351
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,700
 Treasure your time, Old Han. 

352
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:45,580
 I have no plans to retire. What about you? 

353
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:50,100
 My career will definitely be one day longer than yours. 

354
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:53,360
 Bluff! We'll see! 

355
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:56,960
We saw Han Wenqing's somewhat distracted.

356
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:59,680
He didn't avoid One Autumn Leaf's Dragon Tooth. That shouldn't happen.

357
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:01,440
Is he getting tired and can't keep up now?

358
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:04,160
Or could he really be recalling the past?

359
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:06,300
One Autumn Leaf seizes the opportunity to attack Desert Dust.

360
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:09,000
One Autumn Leaf's HP is in the lead. 
    

361
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:16,320
It's unimaginable that Senior Han Wenqing also has times of being suppressed.

362
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:20,880
The heyday of a professional esports player only lasts so long.

363
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:25,020
Even if he doesn't say it, he knows better than anyone.

364
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:29,480
That's why Captain is so anxious to have you take on the future of Tiny Herb.

365
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,220
Tiny Herb's future isn't only one person's future.

366
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:36,260
It's all of ours.

367
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:40,660
I know I'm not in Tiny Herb's future plans.

368
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:42,540
Yifan, don't give up.

369
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:45,601
You still have lots of chances to prove yourself to the captain.

370
00:22:45,601 --> 00:22:50,480
Yingjie, I don't want to prove myself anymore.

371
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:55,160
I don't belong in Tiny Herb's future; I have my own.

372
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:59,040
Professional esports players have such short careers.

373
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:01,660
Everyone is doing their best,

374
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:05,040
how could I give up?

375
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:10,460
After all, no one wants to disappear into the night...

376
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:13,460
without having ever shone.

377
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:16,760
Old fella, are you getting tired?

378
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:18,180
Desert Dust is now very passive

379
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:19,260
and may be defeated with a series of moves

380
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:21,600
by One Autumn Leaf at any time.

381
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,820
I'll end him.

382
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:26,961
Here it comes! Dragon Breaks the Ranks followed by Furious Dragon Strikes the Heart.

383
00:23:26,961 --> 00:23:28,180
A very clean and accurate combo.

384
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:29,620
What happened, Captain?

385
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:31,861
Is Old Han getting old? Why is his APM so slow?

386
00:23:31,861 --> 00:23:34,640
He won't lose, will he? That'll be too humiliating.

387
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:38,840
 "Old"? Are you kidding? 

388
00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:43,380
   

389
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:44,860
Han Wenqing didn't give up!

390
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:46,480
He's defending the dignity of a veteran.

391
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,320
This is the King of Fighting! This is the true Han Wenqing.

392
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,720
This is the spirit of Team Tyranny!

393
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:52,060
Never give up, even if the situation is dire.

394
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:54,180
March forward courageously.

395
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:12,020
Now the game has reached a fever pitch. It's amazing.

396
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:14,600
- Impossible. 
 - One Autumn Leaf's HP advantage did not continue to expand.

397
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:17,060
Desert Dust is not letting the gap widen.

398
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:18,600
Desert Dust's Soaring Tiger.

399
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:20,040
One Autumn Leaf's Furious Dragon Strikes the Heart.

400
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:22,160
Both sides are charging up.

401
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:26,380
The one who lands the blow can seize the rhythm.

402
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:28,500
Han Wenqing and Sun Xiang are both looking for a chance to launch their attacks.

403
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:30,800
It's just a dying struggle.

404
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,120
Here it comes.

405
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,400
Both sides launched almost at the same time.

406
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,660
They hit each other at the same time. Another exchange of HP.

407
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:45,680
But it's very unfavorable for Desert Dust with the lowest HP.

408
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:48,040
King of Fighting, look out!

409
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:52,400
 You're already feeling your performance slipping, aren't you? 

410
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:55,740
 Have you never thought you would leave the stage one day? 

411
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:59,340
 True, I will leave one day. 

412
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:00,940
 I will be defeated. 

413
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:02,440
 I will quit Glory. 

414
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:04,260
 But it's not today. 

415
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:06,260
 Not here! 

416
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:11,341
Nice! One strike with Collapsing Fist to send One Autumn Leaf flying.

417
00:25:11,341 --> 00:25:16,920
He's still attacking while facing such a disadvantage. He's catching up!

418
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:18,960
At present, Desert Dust's HP is at 8%.

419
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,200
One Autumn Leaf's HP is at 9%.

420
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,400
The result of this epic showdown

421
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:23,700
- I will never lose. 
 - is coming to an end soon.

422
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:25,500
Rising Dragon Soars the Sky.

423
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:27,820
One Autumn Leaf used an ult, Rising Dragon Soars the Sky.

424
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:31,721
If the combo lands, he'll directly kill Desert Dust.

425
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:37,541
Excellent.

426
00:25:37,541 --> 00:25:39,920
Desert Dust avoided it with Eagle Stamp.

427
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:40,960
Ferocious Tiger Flurry.

428
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:45,660
Desert Dust used a Striker's ult, Ferocious Tiger Flurry, in the end.

429
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:52,021
Nice! Desert Dust killed One Autumn Leaf at the last moment.

430
00:25:52,021 --> 00:25:55,081
He's still got it! King of Fighting Han Wenqing defeated Sun Xiang!

431
00:25:55,081 --> 00:25:56,400
This epic showdown ended

432
00:25:56,400 --> 00:26:00,280
with the victory of Han Wenqing's Desert Dust.

433
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:02,220
 I'll never give up. 

434
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:10,060
 What's wrong with getting old? 

435
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:11,940
 What's wrong with a slipping performance? 

436
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:13,860
 If you can't win with one punch, then ten it is. 

437
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:15,540
 If not ten, then twenty. 

438
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:17,620
 If 20 is not enough, then 100. 

439
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:19,780
 Until I can't move anymore. 

440
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:23,621
 From game to competition, as an opponent for many years, 

441
00:26:23,621 --> 00:26:25,620
 Han Wenqing is too familiar with One Autumn Leaf. 

442
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:28,361
 That last Eagle Stamp can precisely avoid Rising Dragon Soars the Sky. 

443
00:26:28,361 --> 00:26:32,680
 We saw the veteran's experience and Han Wenqing's perseverance. 

444
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:34,320
 The strength of a newcomer should not be underestimated. 

445
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:36,150
 But the spirit of a veteran's refusal to admit defeat 

446
00:26:36,150 --> 00:26:39,990
 and his unyielding will still impressed us. 

447
00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:43,580
Sun Xiang also came out.

448
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:45,680
Though he lost to one move,

449
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:48,980
he still brought us a very exciting showdown.

450
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:52,320
Let's give applause to the two players again.

451
00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:55,740
   

452
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:02,320
This time I was unlucky.

453
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:06,620
Next time, I will never lose.

454
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:09,900
   

455
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:11,520
Oh, really?

456
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:15,980
I remember that's not what you said before.

457
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:18,721
Thank you. Thank you to the two players again.

458
00:27:18,721 --> 00:27:21,881
- Thanks. Please return to your lounges and get some rest. 
 - King of Fighting.

459
00:27:21,881 --> 00:27:24,300
Do you think it was easy to win the game, King of Fighting?

460
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:25,681
- Sun Xiang's One Autumn Leaf. 
 - What did you think of this challenge?

461
00:27:25,681 --> 00:27:27,240
How well did you think you played?

462
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:28,500
 Sun Xiang! 

463
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:30,661
Sun Xiang, what do you think of what you said just now?

464
00:27:30,661 --> 00:27:33,360
"To settle the years-long feud between One Autumn Leaf and Desert Dust."

465
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,680
Are you just talking big?

466
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:37,840
Are you here just for fun?

467
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:39,500
What did you say?

468
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:40,680
Say it again.

469
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:42,360
Am I wrong?

470
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:44,560
Sun Xiang did play well.

471
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:46,182
The precise Dragon Breaks the Ranks

472
00:27:46,182 --> 00:27:49,360
and Furious Dragon Strikes the Heart, few people can do it.

473
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:51,640
Grandmaster Han, can you comment on Sun Xiang's performance today?

474
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:54,120
But if it were Ye Qiu,

475
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:58,980
that last move, Rising Dragon Soars the Sky, would have never missed.

476
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:09,860
Young boy, it's still too early for you to think of replacing us.

477
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:10,861
 Sun Xiang! 

478
00:28:10,861 --> 00:28:13,060
Do you think you deserve One Autumn Leaf?

479
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:14,760
Sun Xiang, let me tell you.

480
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:16,740
You can never replace Ye Qiu.

481
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:17,860
You can never replace Ye Qiu.

482
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:19,640
 Do you like eports? 

483
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:24,820
 If you like it, consider all of this as a glory, rather than a chance to show off. 

484
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:28,820
Next up is the audiences' interactive competition.

485
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:32,874
At this point, we will invite training camp players from each team

486
00:28:32,874 --> 00:28:34,993
and lucky audience members to play friendly matches.

487
00:28:34,993 --> 00:28:37,983
This is the part where unexpected things can happen in the All-Star Game.

488
00:28:37,983 --> 00:28:39,754
It is not restricted by the rules of the game,

489
00:28:39,754 --> 00:28:41,391
mainly for friendly matches and performance,

490
00:28:41,391 --> 00:28:43,391
top players would often take the stage

491
00:28:43,391 --> 00:28:47,260
so there will be many highlights and surprises.

492
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:49,640
Let's have the first guest on stage.

493
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:53,540
Let's welcome Li Rui from Excellent Era.

494
00:28:55,420 --> 00:28:57,580
What's wrong, Captain?

495
00:28:57,580 --> 00:29:00,060
Play well. Showcase your skills as a pro esports player.

496
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:03,061
Don't worry, Captain. I won't let you down.

497
00:29:03,061 --> 00:29:05,600
This is an opportunity to fight against professionals.

498
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:08,400
It's extremely lucky to be selected.

499
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:09,720
Really?

500
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:11,960
Of course.

501
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:15,280
It's extremely lucky to fight against professionals.

502
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:19,260
It's ultra lucky to fight against Grandmasters,

503
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:22,740
- To be able to fight against Battle God Ye Qiu— 
 - Absolute luckiest.

504
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:24,240
That's not called lucky.

505
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,180
Why?

506
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:26,860
That's called dreaming.

507
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:28,640
Welcome, Li Rui.

508
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:31,400
- If you dream long enough, it may come true. 
 - Okay, let's cut the chase and look at the screen.

509
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:34,860
Who is the lucky one to be chosen?

510
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:37,740
Stop. 
    

511
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:42,541
M-Me?

512
00:29:42,541 --> 00:29:45,800
Let's congratulate her.

513
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:48,861
- What a surprise. 
  - You were chosen, Xiao Tang!

514
00:29:48,861 --> 00:29:50,700
- Play well, don't disgrace your master. 
 - The first person to challenge a pro

515
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:51,980
is actually a girl.

516
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:54,340
- When did you become my master? 
 - Let's welcome her on stage.

517
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:56,540
I have always been.

518
00:29:56,540 --> 00:30:00,220
After learning so much from me, you can't turn your back on me.

519
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:02,280
I was self-taught.

520
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:03,460
Go for it, Xiao Tang.

521
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:06,520
- Go for it, good luck! 
 - Let's welcome our first lucky audience.

522
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:07,940
Hello.

523
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:11,500
Let's say hello first. Introduce yourself, please.

524
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:13,580
Hi, everyone, my name is Tang Rou.

525
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:15,080
It's Sister Tang Rou.

526
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:16,360
Then Old Ye must be here, too.

527
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:21,181
Tang Rou. Let's take a look at their relevant information in Glory.

528
00:30:21,181 --> 00:30:23,940
Let's see the big screen.

529
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:28,520
   
   

530
00:30:30,670 --> 00:30:33,180
   
   

531
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:34,880
- 29 days? 
 - She's completely new.

532
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:36,540
29 days?

533
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:40,541
Does that mean you played Glory for less than a month?

534
00:30:40,541 --> 00:30:41,980
Yes.

535
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:44,160
She turns out to be a rookie of Glory.

536
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:47,121
Li Rui, you'll have to be merciful later.

537
00:30:47,121 --> 00:30:51,761
All right. Let's invite the two players into their battle seats.

538
00:30:51,761 --> 00:30:55,720
A rookie girl of Glory versus a professional-to-be player. What do you think, Mentor Li?

539
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:58,960
I'm looking forward to the sparks the two battle mages will make.

540
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:00,780
   

541
00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:02,840
Game starts.

542
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:06,141
Okay, we see Soft Mist rushing to her opponent right from the start.

543
00:31:06,141 --> 00:31:08,920
She's full of momentum.

544
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:09,940
Too many flaws.

545
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:12,360
Mage Fighter dodged easily.

546
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:14,501
Dragon Tooth! He also easily dodged it.

547
00:31:14,501 --> 00:31:16,880
It seems that Li Rui dealt with it easily.

548
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,680
Falling Flower Palm. Such a quick speed.

549
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:20,500
Mage Fighter made a mistake this time and was directly blown away.

550
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:22,800
Such a quick speed for a newcomer.

551
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:29,261
Another Circle Swing. Mage Fighter is struck down.

552
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:36,020
Mage Fighter strikes back. She actually parried it.

553
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:38,320
I think the audience was as surprised as I was.

554
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:41,360
 After launching Dragon Tooth, most follow it up with Circle Swing. 

555
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:43,780
 At this time, you can use Falling Flower Palm to knock your opponent airborne, 

556
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:45,760
 and interrupt their next attack. 

557
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:51,360
 After that, release Draconic Crusher immediately, 

558
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:53,080
 which will force the opponent to fall down. 

559
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:55,240
 You can then deal as much damage in the next three seconds. 

560
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:57,581
 At this time, if your opponent is an expert, 

561
00:31:57,581 --> 00:31:59,530
 he'll launch Falling Flower Palm to the ground 

562
00:31:59,530 --> 00:32:02,100
 after he stands up to maintain distance. 

563
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:05,540
 So, you need to launch Dragon Breaks the Ranks, which has enough Attack Range. 

564
00:32:05,540 --> 00:32:07,720
 But, of course, it's a test of foresight. 

565
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:09,460
 Be sure to be accurate. 

566
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:12,840
- Tang Rou, keep it up! 
  - Keep it up! 

567
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,840
It seems that Sister Tang Rou has made rapid progress.

568
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:17,400
It's only half a month, and she's made this much progress.

569
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:19,980
And she plays just like Old Ye.

570
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:24,000
Captain, Sun Xiang was just defeated by Old Han,

571
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,720
and now his apprentice is being abused by Sister Tang Rou.

572
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:29,620
This is so beautiful.

573
00:32:29,620 --> 00:32:33,680
 That's right, Tang Rou uses her speed advantage to put pressure on Li Rui continuously. 

574
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:35,160
 It seems that Excellent Era is really having a bad year. 

575
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:36,400
So gossipy.

576
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:38,900
Sister Tang Rou is so mighty.

577
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:41,420
Do you think this is Sun Xiang's expression now?

578
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:43,580
 A player who has just played Glory for less than a month... 

579
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:46,720
 This is a little embarrassing now. 

580
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:48,720
 Li Rui, as a professional-to-be player of Excellent Era, 

581
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:51,520
 will he be defeated by a newcomer like this? 

582
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:53,600
Soft Mist has completely overwhelmed Mage Fighter.

583
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:56,480
Li Rui seems to be the newbie instead.

584
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:00,981
We see that the current HP is 60% versus 30%.

585
00:33:00,981 --> 00:33:02,980
Soft Mist is in the lead.

586
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:04,961
She is charging up for Dragon Breaks the Ranks.

587
00:33:04,961 --> 00:33:06,380
Soft Mist wants to win the game.

588
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:08,881
If this hits, Mage Fighter will be defeated with a series of skills.

589
00:33:08,881 --> 00:33:10,041
It's over.

590
00:33:10,041 --> 00:33:12,720
- Xiao Tang is going to win! 
  - Will this be the first time 

591
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:14,660
- Wonderful! Did you see it? 
  - a pro-to-be player gets defeated 

592
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:16,700
 by a normal Glory player? 

593
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:19,620
No, I meant a newbie player.

594
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:24,260
Right. Mage Fighter can't dodge this blow while in midair.

595
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:26,440
- What? He dodged? 
 - What?

596
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:27,780
What happened?

597
00:33:27,780 --> 00:33:29,880
What, what, what?

598
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:32,300
- Move aside. 
 - He managed to dodge?

599
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:34,680
That's unbelievable!

600
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:41,860
He managed to dodge?

601
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:45,160
It must be a coincidence.

602
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:46,101
He managed to dodge.

603
00:33:46,101 --> 00:33:48,000
Dragon Breaks the Ranks was about to hit him,

604
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,380
yet he escaped without taking any damage.

605
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:51,761
This dodge can be regarded as a professional standard.

606
00:33:51,761 --> 00:33:53,180
Someone helped him.

607
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:54,640
He's just playing normally.

608
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:56,640
Who could it be?

609
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:58,480
Watch his play style carefully.

610
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:01,280
The way he predicts and grasps the timing.

611
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:03,120
Can you recall anyone?

612
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:06,020
That Xiang—

613
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:09,540
It's really that shameless guy.

614
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:11,160
His self-esteem is too strong.

615
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:13,420
That's why he can't afford to lose.

616
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:16,080
Look closely.

617
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:21,360
What?

618
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:22,980
Four consecutive Sky Strikes. Nice!

619
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:25,500
This Battle Mage is extraordinary, as expected.

620
00:34:28,990 --> 00:34:30,550
   

621
00:34:31,380 --> 00:34:32,440
 Nice. 

622
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:34,760
Four consecutive Sky Strikes.

623
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:37,470
Mage Fighter's attack is so quick,

624
00:34:37,470 --> 00:34:38,740
Soft Mist can't fight back at all.

625
00:34:38,740 --> 00:34:41,600
She's going to lose her HP advantage.

626
00:34:42,070 --> 00:34:44,460
   

627
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:46,620
   

628
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:49,300
If it goes on like this, Soft Mist will lose. 
    

629
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:51,380
It's not that easy.

630
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:55,400
She got up.

631
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:57,420
We see that Mage Fighter didn't make a concession.

632
00:34:57,420 --> 00:35:00,660
He's approaching Soft Mist. Draconic Crusher!

633
00:35:01,580 --> 00:35:07,420
What? He cancelled it at the last moment and changed it to Dragon Tooth.

634
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:10,340
Soft Mist only loses one percent of HP.

635
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:15,000
Sky Strike. Another two percent. 
    

636
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,320
What is Mage Fighter doing?

637
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:18,580
Soft Mist doesn't give up.

638
00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:20,880
She's having her character stand up...

639
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:25,560
and rushes toward Mage Fighter. She's going to fight back!

640
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:28,180
Another Dragon Tooth?

641
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:29,660
Mage Fighter uses a micro skill again

642
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:31,360
and consumes 1% of Soft Mist's HP.

643
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:32,900
- Isn't he humiliating her? 
 - That's right.

644
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:34,660
How could he fight like that?

645
00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:35,661
What is he doing?

646
00:35:35,661 --> 00:35:37,080
He's humiliating her with micro skills.

647
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:40,680
Humiliating an amateur in front of the public...

648
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:42,320
Excellent Era is not afraid of losing face.

649
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:44,520
Making fun of an amateur player,

650
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:46,800
is he even qualified for the professional league?

651
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:49,700
Are you kidding? What are you doing?

652
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:51,860
- Are you humiliating her? 
  - Mage Fighter is still using micro skills 

653
00:35:51,860 --> 00:35:53,680
 - to consume Tang Rou's HP little by little.  
 - That's too much.

654
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:55,760
 How could he treat a newcomer like that? 

655
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:58,000
That's so humiliating.

656
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,200
But she doesn't give up.

657
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:02,140
She's still looking for opportunities to fight back.

658
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:21,640
   

659
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:28,580
Soft Mist only has 10% HP left.

660
00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:31,000
Looks like the newbie is going to lose.

661
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:37,460
It's over.

662
00:36:38,260 --> 00:36:40,280
Charging up for another Dragon Breaks the Ranks.

663
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:42,480
As a newbie, I'm afraid it's hard for Soft Mist

664
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:45,500
to copy the previous move and avoid it.

665
00:36:45,501 --> 00:36:49,120
What? Wonderful! She actually dodged it!

666
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:52,220
She actually dodged Dragon Breaks the Ranks precisely!

667
00:36:52,220 --> 00:36:54,961
Exactly. Soft Mist actually dodged a killer move.

668
00:36:54,961 --> 00:36:56,500
It seems that there's also a mysterious person who showed up.

669
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:58,781
What happened? She dodged it?

670
00:36:59,860 --> 00:37:01,940
She dodged it!

671
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:08,500
I can't believe a friendly match could also be this spectacular!

672
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:15,940
Both sides are also fighting much faster than before.

673
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:18,720
This fast rhythm feels like a professional game.

674
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:20,180
At this point, Mage Fighter's HP is still ahead.

675
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:22,400
But both players' HPs are not much. 
    

676
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:38,520
Such a deadlock situation!

677
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:41,000
Mentor Li, what do you think the players will do next?

678
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,400
One hit kill.

679
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:44,800
They can only defeat the other by using an ult in this situation.

680
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:47,000
Otherwise, nobody is sure of winning the game

681
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,500
by just using micro skills with such low HP left.

682
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:50,800
Rising Dragon Soars the Sky!

683
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:53,160
Both players are releasing Rising Dragon Soars the Sky.

684
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:55,380
Seems like they are trying to defeat the other with a one-hit kill.

685
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:57,560
The winner will soon be determined.

686
00:37:57,560 --> 00:37:59,880
You're right. They launched the attack at the same time.

687
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:02,460
Victory or defeat will be decided with this.

688
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:07,561
Not good! Soft Mist's Rising Dragon Soars the Sky missed!

689
00:38:07,561 --> 00:38:10,280
Let's congratulate Mage Fighter.

690
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:11,840
What?

691
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:14,960
Mage Fighter's HP dropped to zero. Soft Mist actually won.

692
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:17,700
What happened? Mage Fighter actually lost?

693
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:19,420
What happened indeed?

694
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:22,580
Everyone, it happened so fast, we have no idea what happened.

695
00:38:22,580 --> 00:38:25,800
Let's watch the slow-motion playback to see what happened.

696
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:28,160
Good. They both launched Rising Dragon Soars the Sky at the same time.

697
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:31,040
They both dodged at the same time.

698
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:33,061
What?

699
00:38:33,061 --> 00:38:36,900
Soft Mist's Rising Dragon Soars the Sky suddenly changed directions. Mage Fighter didn't dodge it.

700
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:38,200
It's Dragon Raising Its Head!

701
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:40,260
Soft Mist actually used Dragon Raising its Head!

702
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:41,820
My god, it really is Dragon Raising its Head!

703
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:43,040
Unbelievable!

704
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:44,680
What just happened!

705
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:49,100
Soft Mist used Dragon Raising its Head that only Grandmaster Ye Qiu could do.

706
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:53,620
Let's congratulate Soft Mist for winning this match!

707
00:38:54,140 --> 00:38:56,090
   

708
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:05,260
 Did you give it your all this time? 

709
00:39:07,340 --> 00:39:10,880
 I give it my all in every match. 

710
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:15,700
♫  Proclaim to the world on top of the sky  ♫

711
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:18,280
 Are you really going to give up like this? 

712
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:22,540
 Giving up does not mean admitting defeat. 

713
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:29,560
 Okay. Don't be a deserter by then. 

714
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:32,020
 Then see you at the All-Star next year! 

715
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:36,720
 Dragon Raising its Head! Dragon Raising its Head! 

716
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:39,960
 Rebound if you hit rock bottom. 

717
00:39:41,340 --> 00:39:45,220
 Never say you'd give up. 

718
00:39:45,220 --> 00:39:49,380
♫  Up on the clouds and down in the dust  ♫

719

♫  I came from the legend to carry on a legend  ♫

721
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:00,800
Grandmaster Ye Qiu!

♫  This battle is for everyone to remember  ♫

723
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:05,500
Grandmaster! Grandmaster Ye Qiu!

724
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:07,140
Where's Grandmaster Ye Qiu?

725
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:09,200
Where's Grandmaster Ye Qiu?

726
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:10,840
He just...

727
00:40:12,620 --> 00:40:13,541
left.

728
00:40:13,541 --> 00:40:15,060
Hurry!

729
00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:24,920
 Every unwilling departure... 

730
00:40:25,620 --> 00:40:29,300
 is for the sake of a glorious return.
