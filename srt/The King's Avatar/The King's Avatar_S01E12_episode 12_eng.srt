 "Light From the Ashes" - Cai Weize 

2
00:00:02,290 --> 00:00:06,230
♫  Countless fireflies born from insignificance  ♫

3
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:10,120
♫  Riding the long wind to gather into a shining galaxy  ♫

4
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:13,970
♫  Proclaim to the world on top of the sky  ♫

5
00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:19,130
♫  We will return in glory  ♫

6
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:23,740
♫  Clear the clouds and descend with the heat  ♫

7
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:27,330
♫  Melting ice and snow, overcoming twists and turns  ♫

8
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:31,130
♫  Finally at this moment of peak  ♫

9
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:35,260
♫  There is a figure that coincides with the past  ♫

10
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:39,080
♫  The glory of the past that never came  ♫

11
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:42,770
♫  The pride that the future will never pass  ♫

12
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:46,550
♫  Our fingertips intertwined and condensed  ♫

13
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:50,430
♫  Into a song that ignited the battlefield  ♫

14
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:54,220
♫  The only light in an endless night  ♫

15
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:58,100
♫  Is you and me who overcame mediocrity  ♫

16
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:01,980
♫  Up on the clouds and down in the dust  ♫

17
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:05,880
♫  Fireflies making every effort to illuminate  ♫

18
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:09,660
♫  I came from the legend to carry on a legend  ♫

19
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:13,560
♫  Once it's disruptive, a decade of persistence won't be in vain  ♫

20
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:17,380
♫  Up on the clouds and down in the dust  ♫

21
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:21,110
♫  Fireflies making every effort to illuminate  ♫

22
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:24,780
♫  Fireflies making every effort to illuminate  ♫

23
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:27,960
   

24
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:30,240
   

25
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,560
 No way! Master! 

26
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:39,360
 You promised to help Blue Brook Guild reclaim the dungeon record for Line Canyon. 

27
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,480
 Why are you suddenly unable to do it? 

28
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:44,460
 Don't ask me to help you break dungeon records again. 

29
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:46,840
 What happened? 

30
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:49,160
 Who the hell bought you out? 

31
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:51,080
 I don't care. I can give you more items. 

32
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:55,805
 Offer another price for the Line Canyon. Blue Brook has to reclaim the record. 

33
00:01:57,324 --> 00:01:58,780
 A higher price won't make any difference. 

34
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:01,080
 The service for raiding dungeons is also over. 

35
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:03,000
 What? What? What? 

36
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,055
 Are you really giving up on those precious items? Are you going out of business? 

37
00:02:07,055 --> 00:02:10,760
 Master, you're not really retiring, are you? 

38
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:12,080
 You can't! 

39
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:16,200
 You know Blue Brook guild wasn't involved with what happened in Congee Forest. 

40
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:21,160
 I won't be boosting you again, but I can still get Blue Brook guild your first dungeon kill. 

41
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:24,040
 Wait, hold up. Let me get this straight. 

42
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:29,560
 You won't help us with the dungeon, but you will continue helping us get new records? 

43
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:32,720
 Master, your logic doesn't make any sense. 

44
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,800
Please check to see if the revisions are okay.

45
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,420
- It's good. 
 - Okay.

46
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,320
 Master, are you still with me? 

47
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:56,600
 Let me show you something. 

48
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,470
   

49
00:03:01,035 --> 00:03:05,040
"Line Canyon Dungeon Strategy Guide 101."

50
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,440
"Easiest guide to follow."

51
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,520
"Most surprising dungeon record."

52
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:12,480
"No matter how inexperienced your team players are,

53
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:13,920
as long as you have this guide,

54
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,560
You'll break the record for sure."

55
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,680
 With this guide, you can conquer all. 

56
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,635
 So do you want to give it a try? 

57
00:03:21,635 --> 00:03:23,180
I'll buy it!

58
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,100
Done.

59
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:30,240
So from now on,

60
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:33,000
we're selling strategy guides in exchange for the weapons we need?

61
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:38,135
"When God closes a door, he opens a window."

62
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:42,680
There's no fun in that. I would rather get them by myself.

63
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:45,000
We have to say thank you to those who put us down.

64
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,080
They made us realize life gets even easier if you're on the floor.

65
00:03:50,940 --> 00:04:00,060
 Subtitles and Timing provided to you by💥🍥 TEAM 7️⃣ 🍥💥 @viki.com 

66
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:05,040
So in the future, you won't need me for dungeons.

67
00:04:05,735 --> 00:04:08,040
What? You want to take sick leave again?

68
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:11,580
Your insomnia is cured now; what illness is next?

69
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,540
Anxiety.

70
00:04:18,185 --> 00:04:21,760
You're too young to have anxiety.

71
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:27,900
All those weekends at All-Star Games, you were with me.

72
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:29,580
This year you're not around.

73
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:31,800
It just feels wrong.

74
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:36,600
You were there for the past seven years.

75
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:39,260
Why don't you just consider making it a habit of yours

76
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:40,960
and come with me.

77
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,600
And do what?

78
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:49,120
To be there for me, of course.

79
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,340
I even got the tickets ready!

80
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:04,680
I see I'm not the only one you invited.

81
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,940
I'm just afraid that you'd feel lonely if you were alone.

82
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:11,640
So I set you up with two bodyguards.

83
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:15,330
After all, you're a master of the fighting spirit.

84
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:20,020
Or you can come with a figure board of One Autumn Leaf.

85
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:23,900
Then I can take souvenir photos for you.

86
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,440
Are you even listening?

87
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,920
You're good at multitasking.

88
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:37,320
Talking while enjoying your coffee.

89
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,760
Here.

90
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:00,340
A real man doesn't care at all about coffee stains.

91
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:04,000
Warrior Ye Xiu, I'm heading back to Excellent Era.

92
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I assume you're going back to the Happy Internet Cafe.

93
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,740
I'll see you at the All-Star Game.

94
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:20,700
She really is becoming more and more adept at speaking.

95
00:06:22,385 --> 00:06:24,665
I wonder where she got that from?

96
00:06:24,665 --> 00:06:27,200
   

97
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:30,800
Xiao Ming promised that he'd come up with tickets for the All-Star Game.

98
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:34,100
But he still hasn't sent us the tickets!

99
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:36,160
I already have all the supplies prepared!

100
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,580
Can we really count on him?

101
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:40,081
 Xiao Ming hasn't shown up since Master retired. 

102
00:06:40,081 --> 00:06:41,540
 I can't get hold of him either. 

103
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:43,440
Then what should we do?

104
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,300
The All-Stars Game is tomorrow!

105
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:48,560
Should we just sit outside and watch?

106
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,840
I can't do that! I have to be there!

107
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,580
What happened? Who got on her nerves again?

108
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:56,300
Our boss is not getting

109
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:58,840
the All-Star tickets that she's been looking forward to.

110
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:03,100
By the way, Brother Ye, these two boxes down here,

111
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:05,235
the boss wants you to move them over there?

112
00:07:05,235 --> 00:07:07,695
What a fake.

113
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,235
Boss, here are your boxes.

114
00:07:10,235 --> 00:07:12,075
Just put them here.

115
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,180
Where?

116
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:17,780
On the floor!

117
00:07:35,885 --> 00:07:38,345
What should I do?

118
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,180
So annoying.

119
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:59,020
Xiao Ming, you did it!

120
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,880
He got us two free tickets.

121
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,620
That's three in total.

122
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:08,740
Tomorrow, you, Xiao Tang, and I,

123
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:10,720
the three of us will go together.

124
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:14,440
What? I have to work.

125
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:17,840
Who's the boss here?

126
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:19,760
Of course, you are.

127
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,160
Right?

128
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:23,560
Now your boss is taking you out for the event,

129
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:25,460
and you can only say yes.

130
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:28,661
You know what? Take these two boxes with you tomorrow.

131
00:08:28,661 --> 00:08:31,800
Work for your ticket. Understand?

132
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,740
Wait! Take them to the front desk.

133
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:45,840
Be very careful with them!

134
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:48,080
Those things are more valuable than your life.

135
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,760
Especially that high-class figure board!

136
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:52,220
It costs as much as your monthly salary.

137
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,935
 Or you can come with the figure board of One Autumn Leaf. 

138
00:08:58,935 --> 00:09:01,940
 Then, I can take souvenir photos for you. 

139
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:06,435
 Did she know about this and gave me those tickets on purpose? 

140
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:26,660
All-Star Game, here we come!

141
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:29,880
Good morning, everyone!

142
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:33,420
I'll see you guys at All-Star weekend!

143
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:40,700
Where is everybody?

144
00:09:51,930 --> 00:09:54,260
   
   

145
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:58,310
   

146
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:09,780
Where's Ye Xiu? Did he get on the bus?

147
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,630
I think he did...

148
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:16,680
   
   

149
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:18,760
 Since the start of Glory Pro League, 

150
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:21,581
 all pro gamers come together every year 

151
00:10:21,581 --> 00:10:23,960
 to have a carnival style gathering.  

152
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:26,080
 This event is all about performance. 

153
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:29,100
 Among them are 24 top gamers participating in the Glory All star Game. 

154
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:31,201
 This is the most popular event of the year. 

155
00:10:31,201 --> 00:10:33,960
 This year, which dark horse will emerge? 

156
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:36,060
 And what kind of performance will they present to us? 

157
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:38,420
 I really can't wait. 

158
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:40,540
   
   

159
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:42,420
   
   

160
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:46,020
   
   

161
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:49,020
   
   

162
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:50,620
   
   

163
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:53,290
   
   

164
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:55,820
   
   

165
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,720
   

166
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:02,750
   

167
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:15,160
 Team Tyranny must win! Team Tyranny must win! 

168
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:18,440
 Team Tyranny must win! 

169
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:20,000
Hi, Boss.

170
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,720
Hello. You're all here.

171
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:24,900
Are there still places over there?

172
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:26,120
126 section B for vendors' booths.

173
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,880
Thank you.

174
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:31,840
Boss.

175
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:33,560
You're here.

176
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:37,260
Hi, Boss.

177
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:39,080
 See you later. 

178
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:06,360
Come take a look!

179
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:09,060
Authentic Glory textbooks.

180
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:10,960
The true battle god.

181
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:14,880
Genuine master, Ye Qiu. One Autumn Leaf.

182
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:20,120
We have supporting items for Ye Qiu.

183
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:22,920
Feel free to take them!

184
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,040
Cheer for Ye Qiu!

185
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,340
Master One Autumn Leaf.

186
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:33,880
Please support Ye Qiu!

187
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:36,000
Please support Ye Qiu!

188
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,200
Thank you.

189
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:40,181
Support Ye Qiu! Master One Autumn Leaf.

190
00:12:40,181 --> 00:12:42,220
Thank you for your support.

191
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:56,480
Thank you.

192
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,760
Hey, where have you been?

193
00:13:06,161 --> 00:13:08,440
The other shops are ready.

194
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:10,760
They're all here. It's time to go inside.

195
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:12,980
Hurry up, you guys.

196
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:19,581
Please come and take a look at

197
00:13:19,581 --> 00:13:22,480
the real master, One Autumn Leaf, Ye Qiu!

198
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:28,380
 Come! This way. Support Excellent Era! 

199
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:30,640
 They're free. 

200
00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:35,660
   
   

201
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:39,140
Hey, Xiao Ming. You're here.

202
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:41,120
I thought you weren't coming.

203
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,560
Luckily, you made it.

204
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:45,060
Thanks for the tickets.

205
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:46,840
I know they were difficult to get.

206
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:48,880
It must have been hard for you.

207
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:52,100
What's with you this month?

208
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:54,700
I haven't seen you post in the group chat.

209
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:57,800
You knew about Master, right?

210
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:00,720
By the way.

211
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:06,220
This is the only picture of Ye Qiu, One Autumn Leaf.

212
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:09,720
I had someone print this specially for me.

213
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,560
We'll give it to everyone.

214
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:14,421
It is the right time to let all people know

215
00:14:14,421 --> 00:14:17,980
that Master is the true summit of Glory.

216
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:19,800
You take this.

217
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,860
Guo Guo!

218
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:27,840
Ye Qiu was indeed the top player before.

219
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,900
He's not anymore.

220
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:32,400
What the heck are you talking about?

221
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:36,660
Guo Guo, Ye Qiu retired.

222
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:40,060
 Sun Xiang, battle god. 

223
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:45,120
Now it's Excellent Era's Sun Xiang's turn.

224
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:50,240
 Sun Xiang, Battle God! Sun Xiang! 

225
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:54,840
I don't know where you got these tickets,

226
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:59,840
but now Ye Qiu is no longer a member of our Excellent Era.

227
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:03,070
Let me help you clean this up.

228
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:05,700
- You should get going. 
 - Xiao Ming.

229
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:08,620
There are some things you shouldn't take lightly.

230
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:13,060
I've known you for ages. We've always been the fans of Master Ye Qiu.

231
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:16,140
Why don't you understand yet?

232
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:18,980
Idols have their own timing.

233
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:21,520
Three years ago, Ye Qiu was the Master.

234
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:24,100
Now, Sun Xiang is Master.

235
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:27,140
That's their business; it has nothing to do with us.

236
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:29,180
It's true that their business is not our concern.

237
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:31,340
But Glory is not your concern either.

238
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:33,300
Come here. Help me out.

239
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,460
Don't clear it away.

240
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:38,460
Get away!

241
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:42,420
Get away from Ye Qiu. Don't touch it.

242
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:43,840
Take the table away.

243
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:45,600
All of it goes.

244
00:15:56,330 --> 00:16:00,230
   
   

245
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:30,400
Guo Guo, are you okay?

246
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,621
Boss, the floor is cold.

247
00:16:32,621 --> 00:16:35,320
- Guo Guo... 
 - We'll take the things back.

248
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:38,761
I never needed to follow a trendy idol for the feeling of belonging.

249
00:16:38,761 --> 00:16:40,980
That's just a trend.

250
00:16:57,780 --> 00:16:59,400
Look.

251
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:02,260
Do something!

252
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:04,140
What can I do? Do you have an idea?

253
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:06,340
No. I don't know either.

254
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:08,660
Let's do it together.

255
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:10,240
Okay.

256
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:17,240
Ye Qiu's not coming back?

257
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:21,120
Doing this is a waste of time.

258
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:23,020
I'm just a joke.

259
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:27,660
Guo Guo, you know Ye Qiu the best.

260
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:30,040
He won't be beaten by Sun Xiang.

261
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:32,760
He's hiding somewhere, waiting to fight his way back to Glory.

262
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,920
He knows that you're supporting him.

263
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:38,300
It doesn't matter whether Ye Qiu comes back or not.

264
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:45,060
What's the meaning of all this if he won't come back?

265
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:46,860
Really?

266
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:51,140
So, what's the meaning of all this if he does come back?

267
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:02,180
If you're doing all this to get him to come back, it's really only for your own satisfaction.

268
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:07,300
I think that whether it's for him or for you,

269
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:10,240
it's all meaningless.

270
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:13,680
   

271
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:17,830
   

272
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:19,990
   

273
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:22,940
   

274
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:24,900
I've always wanted to know...

275
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:27,560
exactly what an idol is.

276
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:31,940
Is it a person, a word,

277
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,020
or power?

278
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:40,190
   
   

279
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:58,540
Guo Guo!

280
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:00,940
She can handle it.

281
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:11,120
Come, take a look at this.

282
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:13,640
Guo Guo.

283
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:16,200
I don't know what you think an idol is,

284
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:19,780
but I know what I'm after.

285
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:22,400
Turn all impossible things into things that are possible.

286
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:25,160
That's the meaning that Ye Qiu brought me.

287
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:27,120
As long as Ye Qiu's spirit lives,

288
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:29,420
I'll follow it no matter what.

289
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:32,900
That's the Glory I know.

290
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:34,660
You should have seen it back there.

291
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:36,040
 - Okay, boss  
 - After I said those words,

292
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:37,680
I just turned and left.

293
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:40,560
-  Chill as a cucumber. 
 - I'll come and get you right now.

294
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:09,440
Boss.

295
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,560
Down here.

296
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:12,330
Down here.

297
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,520
Down here.

298
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:36,340
Guo Guo, I'll go get you something to drink.

299
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:37,800
Okay.

300
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:47,260
Who gave me these tickets?

301
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:50,901
Besides Xiao Ming, I didn't ask anyone for them.

302
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:53,840
It could be from some kind-hearted person.

303
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,900
Kind-hearted person?

304
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:57,960
What kind of kind-hearted person would offer me tickets

305
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:00,560
with these kinds of great seats?

306
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:03,660
I'm telling you. I used to sit at the far end.

307
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:05,410
Can you help me tie this?

308
00:21:05,410 --> 00:21:07,720
   

309
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:11,321
Sorry, excuse me.

310
00:21:11,321 --> 00:21:14,320
How can you be so stupid?

311
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:21,500
So this is what it feels like to sit down here.

312
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:24,320
Su Mucheng?

313
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,561
- Su Mu... 
 - Shhh.

314
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,780
Quiet.

315
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:33,860
It's really you?

316
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:38,200
So someone who always sits on the stage

317
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:40,900
will eventually be seated offstage.

318
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:44,580
Thinking about it, it feels a little lonely.

319
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:46,380
Don't you think so?

320
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:48,980
Yes.

321
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:51,480
Exactly what are you doing?

322
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:53,480
 Guess. 

323
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:54,960
Can I take a picture with you?

324
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,140
Okay.

325
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:57,980
Thank you!

326
00:21:57,980 --> 00:21:59,660
All together.

327
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:06,980
What is that badge? Can I see it?

328
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:09,040
Of course.

329
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:11,100
That's cute.

330
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:14,040
It's a limited version for Ye Qiu's fans.

331
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:16,660
So you're Ye Qiu's fan, as well.

332
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:20,640
Of course. I'm the No.1 fan in Ye Qiu's fan club.

333
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:25,180
But there aren't many of us left now.

334
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,320
You like it?

335
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:30,860
You can have it if you want.

336
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:34,060
Let me.

337
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:35,760
Let me.

338
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:42,580
So from today on, I'm fan No.2 in Ye Qiu's fan club.

339
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:45,320
Captain, look out for me.

340
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:48,020
No problem.

341
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:54,341
I have a question I'd like to ask you.

342
00:22:54,341 --> 00:22:55,940
Sure.

343
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:03,520
Are you still in touch with Ye Qiu since he retired?

344
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:08,400
Will he come back and continue to play in Glory?

345
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:11,340
I'll tell you a secret.

346
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:13,140
I think...

347
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:15,080
you'll be seeing him very soon.

348
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:18,520
You're kidding me! Stop it!

349
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:20,800
Really?

350
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:22,901
But I don't even know what he looks like.

351
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:26,780
He wears that black mask in every game.

352
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:28,460
What is he like?

353
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:30,840
How would I know it was him if I saw him?

354
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:31,860
It's Su Mucheng.

355
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:34,260
Stop taking pictures!

356
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:35,860
I have to go.

357
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:37,240
Bye-bye.

358
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:39,220
Bye-bye.

359
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:44,540
By the way, Ye Qiu's looks are just so-so.

360
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:46,980
Two eyes and a nose.

361
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:48,860
Just like everybody else.

362
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:53,800
But when you see him, don't be disappointed with the master.

363
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:56,140
And thanks for your badge.

364
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:57,900
Bye-bye.

365
00:23:57,900 --> 00:23:59,640
Bye-bye.

366
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:06,500
Today is my lucky day!

367
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:07,800
I got such a good seat!

368
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:10,200
And I met Su Mucheng.

369
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,940
That was Su Mucheng!

370
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:13,660
It's just Su Mucheng.

371
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:15,420
What do you know?

372
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:19,441
And you! She was sitting right here, and you didn't even say hello.

373
00:24:19,441 --> 00:24:22,120
I shouldn't have brought you.

374
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:24,420
Rou Rou is back.

375
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:26,120
Thank you.

376
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:30,540
Why's she suddenly so happy?

377
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:33,540
It's nothing, just the power of an idol.

378
00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:44,910
   

379
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:55,400
Hello, Sir.

380
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:00,660
Hello, I'm Qiao Yifan from Team Tiny Herb.

381
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:03,060
I signed up for this year's newby challenge competition.

382
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:05,300
I would like to confirm my registration.

383
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:08,700
Pro gamers should go to your section for confirmation.

384
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:11,100
I just want to know a little ahead of time.

385
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:14,260
That way, you won't have to go all the way over to the section.

386
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:16,920
Is it some kind of surprise for your team?

387
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:19,020
Let's confirm this ahead of time.

388
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:23,380
You're on the list.

389
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:26,020
You can show your captain your abilities.

390
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:29,000
Relax, we won't ruin your surprise.

391
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,600
Thank you.

392
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:33,060
This way.

393
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:43,400
Come in.

394
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:46,140
It's time for teams to enter.

395
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:48,120
Okay, thank you.

396
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:52,040
Did you remember what I just said?

397
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:56,660
I'll prove my value in the All-Star game.

398
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:57,900
Relax.

399
00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:01,140
I'll prove to them that I'm the captain of Excellent Era.

400
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:03,540
That I'm better than Ye Qiu.

401
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:08,880
Go for it.

402
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:33,470
   

403
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:43,180
   

404
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:47,610
   

405
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:56,850
   

406
00:27:13,430 --> 00:27:19,860
   

407
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:45,020
   

408
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:47,141
Ladies and gentlemen, this is live coverage

409
00:27:47,141 --> 00:27:49,080
of Glory All-Star Game weekend sponsored by Suning.

410
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:50,480
I'm the commentator, Pen Lin.

411
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:52,700
I'm your old friend, Li Yibo.

412
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:55,020
Hello to all our friends here with us and those who are watching.

413
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:56,280
Hello to all of you out there.

414
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:59,741
Hi. I'm your old friend, Xiao Luo.

415
00:27:59,741 --> 00:28:01,480
Thank you for staying with Glory for ten years.

416
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:04,880
This is Glory's annual event, Glory All-Star Game.

417
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:07,040
Are you ready for it?

418
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:10,560
We're ready!

419
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:17,221
Now, let's bring all the teams out.

420
00:28:17,221 --> 00:28:19,600
They are Team Thunderclap!

421
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:22,280
Team Excellent Era!

422
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:25,300
Team Blue Rain!

423
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,260
Team Tyranny!

424
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:31,400
Team Tiny Herb!

425
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,280
Team Void!

426
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:38,380
Again, thank you for coming and welcome.

427
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:42,601
Glory has been with us for the past ten years.

428
00:28:42,601 --> 00:28:43,750
In these ten years,

429
00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:47,320
we have seen so many young talents bring excitement to Glory.

430
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:52,780
But we also won't forget those names no longer in the League.

431
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:57,740
They made Glory great.

432
00:28:57,740 --> 00:29:03,700
Now, let's remember those retired players who made Glory great.

433
00:29:03,710 --> 00:29:04,810
   

434
00:29:04,810 --> 00:29:05,850
   

435
00:29:05,890 --> 00:29:06,990
   

436
00:29:07,010 --> 00:29:08,270
   

437
00:29:08,290 --> 00:29:09,520
   

438
00:29:09,530 --> 00:29:10,720
   

439
00:29:10,730 --> 00:29:13,500
   

440
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:18,480
And let's give some applause to all these people who devoted their youth to Glory.

441
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:21,720
Veterans never die, Glory forever.

442
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:25,820
This stage will forever remember the influence you had as players.

443
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:29,020
 MVP! 

444
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:30,261
New talents challenge veterans in competitions.

445
00:29:30,261 --> 00:29:32,280
I bet all of you know what that is.

446
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:36,340
To new gamers, this is their chance to challenge the best.

447
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:37,840
For players who are familiar with the game,

448
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:41,880
it's also fun to play with new players.

449
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:44,820
Now the first challenger today is ready to go.

450
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:46,980
Let's look at the big screen...

451
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:49,560
and welcome our first rookie.

452
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:52,200
Mr. Gao Yingjie from Tiny Herb.

453
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:56,120
Gao Yingjie! Gao Yingjie!

454
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:58,160
Who is this Gao Yingjie?

455
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:00,640
I've never seen him before. Maybe he's never played in public.

456
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:03,700
He's a promising rising new star in Team Tiny Herb.

457
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:07,821
Well, I think Captain Jiexi just brought him out for a test ride.

458
00:30:07,821 --> 00:30:08,941
To introduce him.

459
00:30:08,941 --> 00:30:10,020
We're not yet very familiar with him.

460
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:11,480
So first let's ask Yingjie a few questions.

461
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:13,280
What do you think of this?

462
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:17,040
I... I just chose the same career as the captain did.

463
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:19,380
"The Magician" is the trademark of Team Tiny Herb.

464
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:23,081
So, for today, who would you like to challenge?

465
00:30:23,081 --> 00:30:28,220
Captain... No, it's my senior, Wang Jiexi.

466
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:31,420
I'll buy you dinner if the captain loses.

467
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:33,700
What kind of bet is that?

468
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:35,900
You just want me to buy you dinner.

469
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:38,260
You heard that? Fake friends.

470
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:41,500
Mind your words. Fake friends?

471
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:43,741
Don't you know he's best friends with Qiao Yifan?

472
00:30:43,741 --> 00:30:46,401
- Why don't you ask Yifan? 
 - Now let's welcome the Captain of Team Tiny Herb.

473
00:30:46,401 --> 00:30:47,820
How would he know...

474
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:49,220
I think Wang Jiexi will win.

475
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:50,680
What do you say? Right?

476
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:53,380
 Welcome, Wang Jiexi 

477
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:54,780
Welcome, Captain.

478
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:57,620
Now both players have come onstage.

479
00:30:57,620 --> 00:31:00,460
We welcome these two to a one-on-one competition.

480
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:02,360
 - Who would have imagined, Gao Yingjie...  
 - Yingjie.

481
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:04,360
 ...would be challenging his captain. 

482
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:06,600
 Wang Jiexi, also known as "the Magician," 

483
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:09,700
 and their characters Mu En and Vaccaria share the same class. 

484
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:11,520
 Facing off against the most powerful "magician," 

485
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:13,260
 Gao Yingjie is trying to prove himself. 

486
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:16,020
 Our first event in the All-Star games is already exciting. 

487
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:17,400
 All right, let's head back to the game. 

488
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:19,360
 First show in the All-Star Young talents challenge. 

489
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:21,560
 Gao Yingjie vs. Wang Jiexi. 

490
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:23,120
 The competition will be on the Forest map. 

491
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:25,501
 The forest map is perfect for hiding. 

492
00:31:25,501 --> 00:31:29,080
 So if one party is outflanked in the woods, you can't really locate him. 

493
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:30,590
   

494
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:34,220
 We can see Mu En is being cautious. 

495
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:36,281
 He found a hideaway in the woods. 

496
00:31:36,281 --> 00:31:39,600
 Looks like he's feeling enormous pressure facing his captain. 

497
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:46,140
 Vaccaria continues searching above the woods. 

498
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:47,360
 Mu En has a good starting position. 

499
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:49,460
 He avoided being in the field of vision of Vaccaria. 

500
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:51,781
 So if it continues like this, whoever finds the other player first 

501
00:31:51,781 --> 00:31:54,720
 will be in a dominant position. 

502
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,620
 Vaccaria is being extremely sensitive. 

503
00:31:57,620 --> 00:32:00,300
 He is marching right towards Mu En. 

504
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:02,860
 They are about to make contact. 

505
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:05,260
 Oh no! Mu En has been discovered! 

506
00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:25,940
 Wang Jiexi really plays tough! 

507
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:27,761
 He pinpointed the location of Xiao Gao at once. 

508
00:32:27,761 --> 00:32:29,240
 And he attacked right away. 

509
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:31,120
 We can see Gao Yingjie was not ready for this. 

510
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:33,140
 He's been retreating ever since Vaccaria exposed him. 

511
00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:35,720
 He has no chance to strike back. 

512
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:41,561
 Mu En's HP is down to 68%. 

513
00:32:41,561 --> 00:32:43,761
Wang Jiexi isn't going to just kill the young guy, is he?

514
00:32:43,761 --> 00:32:45,040
Does he need to take it that seriously?

515
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:47,080
Isn't it just a warm-up game for his new player?

516
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:50,041
And to be honest, this doesn't look like Wang Jiexi's style.

517
00:32:50,041 --> 00:32:51,600
We can't be sure whether this is his style or not.

518
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:54,420
And we're not yet sure who will be the winner.

519
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:56,540
There are different kinds of performances.

520
00:32:56,540 --> 00:32:58,690
 This might be the biggest weakness when they're fighting against more experienced players. 

521
00:32:58,690 --> 00:33:00,620
 Let's hope Xiao Gao will quickly get used to this tempo 

522
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:03,000
 because his HP is running low. 

523
00:33:22,790 --> 00:33:25,110
   

524
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:37,860
 Vaccaria has 85% HP left. 

525
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:55,840
 Great! 

526
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:57,800
 Mu En used his skills a second before Vaccaria's explosion 

527
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:58,640
 and escaped nicely. 

528
00:33:58,640 --> 00:33:59,740
 Will that be the turning point in this game? 

529
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:00,961
 Vaccaria has lost his target. 

530
00:34:00,961 --> 00:34:02,100
 He seems stuck. 

531
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:03,320
 How will he handle this? 

532
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:05,180
 It seems that he's trying to predict Mu En's position. 

533
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:06,641
 No wonder they call him "magician." 

534
00:34:06,641 --> 00:34:08,140
 He has a great grasp of the overall picture. 

535
00:34:08,140 --> 00:34:10,740
 He's moving towards Mu En. 

536
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:19,100
 Mu En is changing his position. 

537
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:20,740
 He's looking for a chance to attack. 

538
00:34:20,740 --> 00:34:23,240
 Vaccaria is being very cautious. 

539
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:37,800
 Vaccaria isn't flying low, 

540
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:40,320
 he used a lava flask and set his surroundings on fire. 

541
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:43,360
 He is trying to make Mu En show himself. 

542
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:50,800
This Wang Jiexi is playing hard, with no mercy.

543
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:53,980
Yes, Xiao Gao went too far in challenging him,

544
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:57,600
but he could be a little more subtle.

545
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:58,900
He might be doing it

546
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:01,600
to provoke Xiao Gao's will to fight.

547
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,580
We see now that Mu En is surrounded by fire.

548
00:35:03,580 --> 00:35:05,540
He's being burned. His HP is running low!

549
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:09,700
If he doesn't find a way out now, he might lose the final shot.

550
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:10,950
   

551
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:18,800
What is he waiting for?

552
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,860
Could Gao Yinjie have a better tactic?

553
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:22,200
Mu En is still in the flames.

554
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:24,360
If this continues, Mu En will vanish into dust.

555
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:25,480
Yes, we can see his HP is still dropping.

556
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:28,420
If he doesn't move right now, then this is the end of the game.

557
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:31,000
That's right. This is very bad for Mu En.

558
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:34,560
He needs to adjust his position right now, immediately!

559
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:41,840
 Captain. 

560
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:45,400
 I-I'm not ready for this yet. 

561
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:57,260
 That's okay, Yingjie. 

562
00:35:57,260 --> 00:36:00,220
 It doesn't matter who wins this competition. 

563
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:04,500
 What really matters is that you have to do your very best. 

564
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:06,220
 You're very gifted. 

565
00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:11,100
 As long as you show them what you've really got, that's enough. 

566
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:16,560
 We're not afraid to lose, and we will always fight. 

567
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:18,460
 That's the spirit! 

568
00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:19,980
 Understand? 

569
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:27,461
 Mu En is making his move! He's moved! 

570
00:36:27,461 --> 00:36:28,600
 He made it out of the flames! 

571
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:29,680
 Vaccaria is right behind him. 

572
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:30,861
 They're about to make contact! 

573
00:36:30,861 --> 00:36:33,640
 This is a fight all about skills. 

574
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:35,820
 We can see that both of them are taking advantage of the forest 

575
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:39,060
 and avoiding their opponents' attacks by changing position. 

576
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:04,600
 Their HPs are getting closer! 

577
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:05,700
 Nice play by Xiao Gao! 

578
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:09,280
 A speedy chase like this is only possible among witches. 

579
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:13,361
 Yes, only among the very best high-level players. 

580
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:22,540
 Xiao Gao's performance is outstanding. 

581
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:24,020
 This is a battle between two magicians. 

582
00:37:24,020 --> 00:37:29,060
 Yes. It appears that Gao Yingjie from Team Tiny Herb may be the successor of the Magician. 

583
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:40,120
 Lightning chain hit! 

584
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:41,180
 Oh no! Mu En is in danger. 

585
00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:43,000
 If he falls here, the game is over. 

586
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,880
 Mu En, you can do it! 

587
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:53,020
 If you don't trust yourself when winning, 

588
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:54,780
 no matter how many times you practice, 

589
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:56,860
 you'll never win. 

590
00:37:58,160 --> 00:37:59,980
 You have to trust yourself! 

591
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:05,620
You can do it!

592
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:10,100
 Nice! Mu En didn't give up. 

593
00:38:21,170 --> 00:38:24,380
   

594
00:38:24,380 --> 00:38:25,800
 Great! Besom Cyclone! Very limited distance! 

595
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:29,000
 He hit Vaccaria at the very second they met. 

596
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,080
 What a great newbie! 

597
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:34,201
 With a disadvantage like this, he managed to even up their HPs. 

598
00:38:34,201 --> 00:38:36,900
 Now the HPs of the two players are almost the same. 

599
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:41,520
In speed battles like this one, one mistake can cost you your life.

600
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:44,080
He is good.

601
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:46,520
So this young guy is a rising star.

602
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:48,140
Wang Jiexi might actually lose.

603
00:38:48,140 --> 00:38:49,640
That is really good. Such a powerful newcomer!

604
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:51,200
Both HPs are red now!

605
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:54,241
It's about to end. The last strike!

606
00:38:58,220 --> 00:39:01,781
At the same time! They released the Star-Rays at the same time!

607
00:39:01,781 --> 00:39:05,080
   

608
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:08,380
We don't have a clear view of what is happening in there.

609
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:09,640
Exactly who is the winner?

610
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:10,980
They were too fast!

611
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:14,220
Let's see who will be the last one standing,

612
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:23,440
It is Mu En! Mu En walked out alive!

613
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:25,420
Amazing! Mu En survived!

614
00:39:25,420 --> 00:39:27,880
The victory goes to newbie Gao Yingjie!

615
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:28,881
That was unbelievable.

616
00:39:28,881 --> 00:39:31,620
Gao Yingjie has beaten Wang Jiexi, his own captain.

617
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:33,760
 That's right. And that is the fun of these games. 

618
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:37,560
 No one is a sure winner before he really wins. As long as you fight. 

619
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:40,340
Yingjie won!

620
00:39:40,340 --> 00:39:43,120
Am I dreaming?

621
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:45,280
Heavens!

622
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:47,580
Wang Jiexi lost!

623
00:39:47,580 --> 00:39:51,200
Wrong, Wang Jiexi didn't lose.

624
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:53,560
What do you mean?

625
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:56,360
Wang Jiexi lost on purpose.

626
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:57,780
He did it deliberately?

627
00:39:57,780 --> 00:39:58,880
No way!

628
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:00,780
I can tell when it's deliberate. No way.

629
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:03,160
He lowered his skill points.

630
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:07,700
If that's the case, then it kind of makes sense...

631
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:09,460
But... But it doesn't make sense.

632
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:11,960
He didn't have to do this. Even if it's for someone from his own team.

633
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:13,600
Why did Wang Jiexi do it?

634
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:15,520
Simple.

635
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:17,760
For Team Tiny Herb's future.

636
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:22,500
In pro-gaming, some might rise again despite excruciating failure.

637
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:27,200
Others need a victory at the right moment to build up his own confidence.

638
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:29,080
Gao Yingjie is one of the latter.

639
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:32,980
That's why Wang Jiexi tried so hard to let him win

640
00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:37,500
even when that meant sacrificing himself.

641
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:44,700
He's a captain worthy of that name.

642
