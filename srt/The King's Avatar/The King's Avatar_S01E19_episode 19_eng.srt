Bye!

24
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:48,520
- Drive.
- Okay.

25
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:56,290
Finally! He's left.

26
00:01:56,290 --> 00:01:58,480
He's more difficult than you are!

27
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:06,460
Is my big brother really difficult?

28
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:12,700
Wait!

29
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:20,150
Are you Ye Qiu or Ye Xiu?

30
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:24,320
I'm Qiu Qiu.

31
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:26,490
Qiu...

32
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:28,880
If you were Ye Qiu, I'd be Ye Xiu.

33
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,706
Nobody's fool!

34
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,360
Smart girl.

35
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:42,830
Could he buy a new one?

36
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:45,810
Always fixing this old one.

37
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:15,871
Ye Xiu... 
  

38
00:03:15,871 --> 00:03:18,640
You wanna trick me again?

39
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:24,230
 

40
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:25,570
Very nice!
 

41
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:27,330
It's pretty!

42
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:29,730
You're more thoughtful
when growing one year older.

43
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:32,730
Mu Cheng, do you like it? Look good on me, right?

44
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:35,070
It's like custom-made for you. Very pretty.

45
00:03:35,070 --> 00:03:37,720
Couldn't agree more. It must be expensive.

46
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,650
It's okay. Got a New Year discount.

47
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:41,400
Three for 20 yuan.

48
00:03:42,502 --> 00:03:44,940
Here, Mu Cheng. It's for you.

49
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:47,810
Another one is for Tang. I'll go working.

50
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:49,690
Wait.

51
00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:55,430
Come here. This is for you.

52
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:57,260
Come here.

53
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:02,300
Three for 20 yuan? Scram!

54
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:18,050
Okay. Got it. Don't worry.

55
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:20,790
I'll make sure
he'll be at the celebration in 30 minutes.

56
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:22,140
Okay.

57
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:24,622
Sun Xiang!

58
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:26,670
Sun...

59
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:29,370
The celebration is about to start.

60
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:31,070
What are you doing here?

61
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:32,640
I'm busy.

62
00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:40,230
Are you learning Dragon Head Raising?

63
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:42,090
I'll make it.

64
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:46,930
It's just a single move.

65
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:48,550
Is it very important?

66
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:51,800
I'll beat Ye Qiu with Dragon Head Raising.

67
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:56,940
Ye Qiu? He's not even qualified to be your rival.

68
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:59,700
Think about it. Nothing would happen if you beat him.

69
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:02,390
I wanna tell people I own Leaf of Autumn.

70
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:05,410
It's yours!

71
00:05:11,446 --> 00:05:12,780
 

72
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:14,970
Well...

73
00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:19,320
Leaf of Autumn could be yours.

74
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,320
Or it could belong to others.

75
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:24,980
Whether you could use Dragon
Head Raising or not isn't the key.

76
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:26,580
I am.

77
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:29,770
Understood?

78
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:33,670
In Jia Shi, it's not enough you can play Glory.

79
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:36,930
You need to understand my game rules.

80
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:39,790
The only thing you need to do is:

81
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:44,770
show me you deserve to be Leaf of Autumn.

82
00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:50,350
Are you done?

83
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:54,350
May you leave?

84
00:06:06,570 --> 00:06:11,450
In 20 minutes, you'd better show up at the celebration.

85
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:24,051
 

86
00:06:24,051 --> 00:06:26,470
 

87
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:27,700
What a pity!

88
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:30,350
Your opening means my leaving.

89
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:32,210
See you in a year.

90
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:34,160
Welcome come back in Spring Festival.

91
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:38,590
My contract will end in a year.

92
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:41,470
Will I have a position in your Xing Xin Team?

93
00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:43,150
Not sure.

94
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:47,190
If you retrogressed, we'd have
to look for another Launcher.

95
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:49,710
I'm the top Launcher in Glory!

96
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:55,010
In one year, my apprentices will
be riding the whirlwind of Glory.

97
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:56,830
Watch your throne.

98
00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:58,360
It might be stolen.

99
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,890
Don't worry.

100
00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:02,840
I've stuck my throne to the ground with Flex Glue.

101
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:06,610
No one could steal or rob it.

102
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:10,660
By the way, speaking of apprentices, he's coming back today.

103
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:11,760
Who?

104
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:15,830
You know who. Little Monster.

105
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:17,360
See you.

106
00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:22,424
  Solo! Solo! Solo!

107
00:07:22,424 --> 00:07:28,375
Solo! Solo! Solo!

108
00:07:30,297 --> 00:07:32,410
Kick off!

109
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:37,610
Move!

110
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,150
Hurry up!

111
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:46,333
A new rule has been added since last year.

112
00:07:46,333 --> 00:07:50,410
Players in Team 2 can't hold
ranking matches without permission.

113
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:54,070
But Captain Ye said players
needed to improve themselves.

114
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:56,710
It's too long if there's only
one ranking match each year.

115
00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:58,950
If someone wasn't convinced, they could fight.

116
00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:02,120
Then we could solo.

117
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,524
I'll go dismiss them.

118
00:08:03,524 --> 00:08:05,200
Watch your back!

119
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:08,380
Remain calm.

120
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:10,830
- Let them finish this round.
- Continue!

121
00:08:12,811 --> 00:08:14,051
Dodge!

122
00:08:14,051 --> 00:08:15,688
Use your skill!

123
00:08:15,688 --> 00:08:17,337
Beat him!

124
00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:30,686
Good job! Great!

125
00:08:30,686 --> 00:08:32,133
Nailed it!

126
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:42,950
You wanna solo with me?

127
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:46,000
Not convinced by my ranking?

128
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,410
If I were not the best, who would be?

129
00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:53,570
I beat you in less one minute.

130
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:55,670
Am I right?

131
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:57,490
I know everything.

132
00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:01,590
If you didn't lose Qiu's return materials,

133
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:04,310
you'd only be the runner-up on the Ranking List!

134
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:06,190
How boisterous!

135
00:09:07,711 --> 00:09:07,731
I've heard someone else
is on the top spot of Team 2.

136
00:09:07,731 --> 00:09:10,450
  I've heard someone
else is on the top spot of Team 2.

137
00:09:11,710 --> 00:09:14,020
Is Li Rui here?

138
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:16,490
He finished the test ahead
of schedule unexpectedly.

139
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:19,310
Captain Ye asked him to train abroad.

140
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:21,310
He was unwilling to go.

141
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:23,310
Unfortunately, Captain Ye left.

142
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:26,870
Otherwise, he'd name Qiu Fei as his successor.

143
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:29,420
Weren't you training abroad?

144
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:30,890
Why come back ahead of time?

145
00:09:30,890 --> 00:09:32,990
If I didn't come back now,

146
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:37,328
things would be totally different in Jia Shi.

147
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:45,210
Would Team 2 change its position, too?

148
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:49,510
Now what?

149
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:51,020
A round of solo.

150
00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:27,200
Nothing more.

151
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,000
I fed you with skills in the last round.

152
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,873
Didn't see you improve more than last year.

153
00:10:30,873 --> 00:10:33,815
Shut up! Beat me first!

154
00:10:53,690 --> 00:10:55,870
Vanishing Step? Impossible!

155
00:10:55,870 --> 00:10:58,250
How could you use it?

156
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:04,002
 

157
00:11:04,002 --> 00:11:06,970
Yeah! Great!

158
00:11:21,473 --> 00:11:25,160
 

159
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:33,110
Prepare a feast for me today! My treat.

160
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:37,210
Leave Team 2 if you don't show up.

161
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:42,810
 

162
00:11:44,390 --> 00:11:47,780
What a good apprentice Ye Qiu has got!

163
00:11:58,730 --> 00:12:01,550
Players in Team 2 have been confirmed.

164
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:05,750
You prevailed over Li Rui just now.

165
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:08,230
He'd lose face. That's all.

166
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:10,450
Nothing will change.

167
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:15,870
Not happy after being kicked out from Team 1?

168
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:17,650
Chen Ye Hui.

169
00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:20,380
You're right.

170
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:25,590
The pot calling the kettle black.

171
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:28,330
Others had built you up for years.

172
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:32,150
Then you suffered a disastrous decline.

173
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:34,550
What' more, you are labeled with...

174
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:36,500
Traitor.

175
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:39,260
Yes, you are a traitor.

176
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:41,270
I feel awful for you.

177
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:43,630
Cut the chase.

178
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:47,390
Beating around the bush makes me sick.

179
00:12:53,210 --> 00:12:57,600
You know what I'm going to say.

180
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:04,390
Ye Qiu betrayed Jia Shi.

181
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:08,580
As his apprentice, you think
Jia Shi won't kick you out?

182
00:13:17,090 --> 00:13:20,030
If you were crawling your way out later,

183
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:23,140
no one would ever know I beat you up.

184
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:25,630
He has built another team.

185
00:13:31,890 --> 00:13:34,850
He's going to revenge on Jia Shi!

186
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:43,970
So what?

187
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:51,540
Qiu Fei. Ye Qiu has ruined your career in Jia Shi.

188
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:55,710
You can't join Team 1 as
long as you're his apprentice.

189
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:57,760
Can you accept it?

190
00:13:58,910 --> 00:14:00,530
Keep talking.

191
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:04,890
I can give you a chance.

192
00:14:04,890 --> 00:14:09,050
It will dissociate you from him.

193
00:14:09,050 --> 00:14:13,950
As long as you help us stop
Ye Qiu from returning the league,

194
00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:17,090
I'll recommend you to the boss tomorrow.

195
00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:31,750
He didn't take you into
account when he left Jia Shi.

196
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:33,980
Think about it.

197
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:48,410
He left like that?

198
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:54,390
But he meant everything for me... in Jia shi.

199
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:56,230
I told you I wouldn't go back.

200
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:58,370
If they want to divorce, fine.

201
00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:03,190
They think it's shameful that
their son is playing eSports.

202
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:05,990
Show your big brother some respect!

203
00:15:08,135 --> 00:15:11,070
You don't want to see
your younger brother, either.

204
00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:15,510
As an overseas returnee, you'll be very successful.

205
00:15:15,510 --> 00:15:18,310
Just wait and inherit our parents' company.

206
00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:20,770
Your brother will not seize power.

207
00:15:20,770 --> 00:15:24,010
Say it again when you're capable of seizing power!

208
00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:31,190
I'm a loser.

209
00:15:31,190 --> 00:15:33,470
I'll never achieve anything.

210
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:36,190
Consider I'm not your family anymore!

211
00:15:56,390 --> 00:15:58,220
Do you still have food?

212
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:00,500
Sorry. We are about to close.

213
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,590
The chef is off work.

214
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:08,100
Dragon Tooth! No bumping!

215
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:09,330
No rush. No rush.

216
00:16:09,330 --> 00:16:11,441
- Fight! Fight! 
 - Go after him!

217
00:16:11,441 --> 00:16:12,980
- Take your time. 
 - Steady yourself.

218
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:14,710
Follow me, fight!

219
00:16:14,710 --> 00:16:17,011
- Hurry up! No rush! 
 - Wait!

220
00:16:17,011 --> 00:16:18,720
Hurry up!

221
00:16:19,166 --> 00:16:19,964
Team up!

222
00:16:19,964 --> 00:16:22,910
- Don't return!
- Team up!

223
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:24,720
Use Dragon Tooth!

224
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,000
Idiot! Let me help you.

225
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:26,940
No no no.

226
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:30,170
Da Jin, Da Jin. Where did you go?

227
00:16:30,170 --> 00:16:33,330
Everything is ready. Wait for you to start Project BBQ!

228
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:36,970
- What are you doing? 
 - It's a crucial time!

229
00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:38,830
Master! What about you?

230
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,720
You lost?

231
00:16:53,850 --> 00:16:54,920
I won!

232
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:57,260
You won! You won!

233
00:17:00,188 --> 00:17:01,320
How amazing!

234
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,110
Amazing!

235
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:03,940
Good job!

236
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:04,900
Same time tomorrow.

237
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:07,240
Okay. Thank you, Master.

238
00:17:07,810 --> 00:17:09,670
Why do they call you "Master"?

239
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:15,580
- New here?
- We could lose.

240
00:17:16,590 --> 00:17:17,980
  Team 2 is on the 7th floor.

241
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:19,630
The elevator is at the door.

242
00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:23,110
I'm new now. But I could be the captain next year.

243
00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:25,480
You have good skills.

244
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:27,790
You should not work as a chef.

245
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:29,710
Stay with me.

246
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:33,000
You are the headwaiter here?

247
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,044
No wonder they all listen to you!

248
00:17:35,044 --> 00:17:37,710
Wait. You did great when using Pseudo-join.

249
00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:42,230
But others will dodge it
when using Quick Standing.

250
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:44,250
What's your suggestion?

251
00:17:45,390 --> 00:17:47,110
You're asking the right person.

252
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:49,870
Sky-strike him to the air first.

253
00:17:49,870 --> 00:17:51,870
Then use Dragon Soaring.

254
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:54,270
Get the DPS first.

255
00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:57,590
Let me tell you. When there's
a chance, use Dragon Tooth.

256
00:17:57,590 --> 00:17:59,610
Stiffness effect.

257
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:03,340
Wait. Speaking of the Circle Swing...

258
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:04,910
You used it too early.

259
00:18:04,910 --> 00:18:07,000
Are you listening to me?

260
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,270
I'm the future captain of Jia Shi.

261
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:11,580
Fawn on me.

262
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:14,830
  What do you mean?

263
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,550
You don't believe me?

264
00:18:19,550 --> 00:18:20,882
I didn't say it.

265
00:18:20,882 --> 00:18:23,990
But Jia Shi values one's competence the most.

266
00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:25,870
You'll have to prove yourself.

267
00:18:25,870 --> 00:18:28,130
Then you can say that to me.

268
00:18:31,530 --> 00:18:34,890
Say it again when you're capable of seizing power!

269
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:39,430
You think I'm a loser, too?

270
00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:44,670
We've got big guns in Team 2.

271
00:18:44,670 --> 00:18:47,770
You can pick a good player to solo with.

272
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:53,150
When you are on the Ranking List, come to me again.

273
00:19:16,233 --> 00:19:19,660
 

274
00:19:29,133 --> 00:19:30,815
In your team,

275
00:19:31,390 --> 00:19:33,270
who's the best player?

276
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,531
 

277
00:19:38,531 --> 00:19:39,970
Chen Ye Hui.
 

278
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:41,930
 

279
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:43,684
Who is it?

280
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,784
Why?

281
00:19:54,510 --> 00:19:56,431
You are Chen Ye Hui?

282
00:19:56,431 --> 00:20:00,230
 

283
00:20:01,430 --> 00:20:03,000
Let's solo.

284
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:06,230
If I win,

285
00:20:07,730 --> 00:20:09,510
I'll...

286
00:20:11,770 --> 00:20:13,890
take over Team 2.

287
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:28,420
You really said that?

288
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:30,990
Chen Ye Hui didn't throw you
out as if you were a psycho?

289
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:32,840
What a big heart he has!

290
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:34,670
Don't call me "psycho".

291
00:20:34,670 --> 00:20:37,850
I have defeated Chen Ye Hui.

292
00:20:39,390 --> 00:20:42,070
Whose idea is this?

293
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:45,510
Whoever defeats the champion
will be the new champion.

294
00:20:47,150 --> 00:20:48,830
Interesting!

295
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:54,190
It's said it was Jia Shi's captain,
Ye Qiu, who came up with it.

296
00:20:54,190 --> 00:20:56,831
- It's him! 
 - Hush!

297
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,670
Great minds think alike!

298
00:21:05,670 --> 00:21:07,310
Agreed.

299
00:21:19,730 --> 00:21:23,340
Now would you want to be my apprentice?

300
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:25,630
I'm the champion of Team 2.

301
00:21:26,430 --> 00:21:28,390
Why would I do so?

302
00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:32,390
You wanna be my master
with your unpolished skills?

303
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:37,200
You wanna learn Pseudo-join
from me last time, right?

304
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,590
You're just putting on an
act with all your nonsense.

305
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:41,830
Who's talking nonsense now?

306
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:44,490
I've been proficient in Pseudo-join.

307
00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:48,030
Then why are you here?

308
00:21:48,030 --> 00:21:50,250
I'm doing well in the restaurant.

309
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:52,380
Why'd I goof off with someone from Team 2?

310
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:54,220
Whatever.

311
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:56,310
I don't care.

312
00:21:56,310 --> 00:21:57,800
Peace out.

313
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:03,430
Your Vanishing Step...

314
00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:07,160
Could you teach me how to do it, please?

315
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:10,790
I really want to learn Vanishing Step.

316
00:22:10,790 --> 00:22:13,030
Could you... please?

317
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:15,315
No way.

318
00:22:16,010 --> 00:22:18,380
Why?

319
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:22,880
If you teach me that, I'll teach you whatever I learn in the future.

320
00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:28,070
Listen to me.

321
00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:32,390
Captain Ye Qiu will come
to vet everyone next week.

322
00:22:32,390 --> 00:22:36,940
With all my skills, I'll be selected to Team 1.

323
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:42,190
I'll learn more kills from
the captain and teach you.

324
00:22:42,190 --> 00:22:43,730
Okay?

325
00:22:46,590 --> 00:22:48,200
Sounds good?

326
00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:50,440
Peace out.

327
00:22:51,410 --> 00:22:53,010
Thanks for the coke.

328
00:22:55,590 --> 00:22:58,430
Could you show me one more time? Just one time.

329
00:22:58,430 --> 00:23:01,270
No way. I told you no.

330
00:23:04,150 --> 00:23:07,340
Wait! I treat you as my friend!

331
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:10,870
There are many unique skills.

332
00:23:10,870 --> 00:23:13,570
Are you not going to teach me?

333
00:23:17,644 --> 00:23:22,617
 

334
00:23:24,630 --> 00:23:26,030
Today's breaking news.

335
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:29,000
After he left Jia Shi, the famous
player Ye Qiu

336
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,870
   built his own team.

337
00:23:30,870 --> 00:23:34,710
According to an informant, Ye Qiu planned to leave after Season 6

338
00:23:34,710 --> 00:23:37,010
when Jia Shi suffered a revenue decline.

339
00:23:37,010 --> 00:23:40,350
Building a new team is something
that has been in his mind.

340
00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:41,502
  Fans of Jia Shi

341
00:23:41,502 --> 00:23:44,150
say Ye Qiu is
returning kindness with ingratitude.

342
00:23:44,150 --> 00:23:46,270
They feel bitterly disappointed.

343
00:23:46,910 --> 00:23:49,240
Coming! Players in Team 1 are all here.

344
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:50,950
Hurry up, let's get ready!

345
00:23:50,950 --> 00:23:52,790
- Where is Captain Ye Qiu?
- Is he coming?

346
00:23:52,790 --> 00:23:55,230
Captain Ye Qiu...

347
00:23:55,230 --> 00:23:56,470
He is coming!

348
00:23:56,470 --> 00:23:58,270
- Hurry up!
- Okay.

349
00:24:01,030 --> 00:24:02,990
Qiu Fei, are you ready?

350
00:24:02,990 --> 00:24:04,760
Our captain is coming.

351
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:07,070
Something came up. You go ahead.

352
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:08,600
Are you ready?

353
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:10,660
We should sign up with the card later.

354
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:13,350
How about I sign up for you?

355
00:24:16,510 --> 00:24:18,150
Okay.

356
00:24:21,470 --> 00:24:24,820
I've told you I had nothing
to do with the school incident.

357
00:24:25,610 --> 00:24:28,070
I didn't start the fight!

358
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:31,375
Dad asks you to come back to make it clear...

359
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:33,900
I have nothing to say to him.

360
00:24:34,510 --> 00:24:36,790
He always thinks I'm a loser, doesn't he?

361
00:24:36,790 --> 00:24:39,310
He smashed my arcade game machine.

362
00:24:39,310 --> 00:24:41,990
When I told him I was
going to be an eSports player,

363
00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:43,520
he even said I was a shame.

364
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:46,670
Don't say it to me. Handle things by yourself.

365
00:24:46,670 --> 00:24:48,430
I'm just telling you what Dad said.

366
00:24:48,430 --> 00:24:50,470
If you don't come back, Dad will go find you.

367
00:24:50,470 --> 00:24:52,190
Why?

368
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:56,470
Why would all of you want to control me?

369
00:24:56,470 --> 00:24:58,070
Listen.

370
00:24:58,070 --> 00:25:03,270
In about 2 years, I'll make some achievement in Jia Shi.

371
00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:09,270
I'll for sure get the
championship in the Glory League.

372
00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:13,170
Otherwise... I'll never go back.

373
00:25:30,950 --> 00:25:31,890
 
Where is Qiu Fei?

374
00:25:31,890 --> 00:25:33,470
I'm here!
 

375
00:25:33,488 --> 00:25:35,113
Sign up now.

376
00:25:35,966 --> 00:25:38,030
Your rival is Chen Ye Hui.

377
00:25:46,110 --> 00:25:47,200
Warm up for a bit.

378
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,270
Let's wait for the captain.

379
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,400
Captain.

380
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,250
Where is his card?

381
00:26:03,250 --> 00:26:04,890
Give it to me.

382
00:26:11,650 --> 00:26:14,670
If you want me to be your apprentice, win this round first.

383
00:26:14,670 --> 00:26:16,070
I...

384
00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:19,650
Start!

385
00:26:22,930 --> 00:26:24,560
Go for it!

386
00:26:39,290 --> 00:26:41,360
Okay. Let's start now.

387
00:26:55,177 --> 00:26:57,020
 

388
00:26:57,020 --> 00:26:59,510
Using Dragon Soaring from the beginning?

389
00:26:59,510 --> 00:27:01,460
He's as proud as before.

390
00:27:12,295 --> 00:27:13,600
 

391
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,670
Qiu Fei is the most talented one among all.

392
00:27:15,670 --> 00:27:19,690
He's tough and brave. His style is much alike yours.

393
00:27:19,690 --> 00:27:21,630
I'm not as stupid.

394
00:27:21,630 --> 00:27:26,200
If it were me, I'd break Zero
Breakthrough's Ground Shaking Wave.

395
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:48,330
Sorry. I'll defeat you soon!

396
00:27:50,470 --> 00:27:52,653
 

397
00:28:00,335 --> 00:28:02,597
 

398
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:15,040
Wait.

399
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:18,910
In the last round, Chen
Ye Hui hit you with Frost Wave.

400
00:28:18,910 --> 00:28:20,950
Why didn't you lose any HP?

401
00:28:20,950 --> 00:28:21,780
What did you mean?

402
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:23,350
Please turn over your account card.

403
00:28:23,350 --> 00:28:24,670
We suspect you were using tag-in services.

404
00:28:24,670 --> 00:28:26,190
It'd injure the fairness of the game.

405
00:28:26,190 --> 00:28:29,190
I have to check your account card.

406
00:28:38,128 --> 00:28:39,730
To rival against him...

407
00:28:41,650 --> 00:28:43,882
I didn't need to cheat.

408
00:28:43,882 --> 00:28:46,290
He... was using tag-on services.

409
00:28:46,290 --> 00:28:48,320
It's not true!

410
00:28:57,780 --> 00:28:59,910
You set me up?

411
00:29:02,215 --> 00:29:03,250
Calm down!

412
00:29:03,250 --> 00:29:04,231
Don't do it!

413
00:29:04,231 --> 00:29:06,180
Calm down! What are you doing?

414
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:08,120
- Let go of me!
- Calm down!

415
00:29:10,030 --> 00:29:13,270
Now what? I was cheating, fine!

416
00:29:13,270 --> 00:29:16,950
Throw me out! Punish me!

417
00:29:21,157 --> 00:29:25,230
So what? I'm a bad boy.

418
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:27,130
I haven't revenged enough.

419
00:29:27,130 --> 00:29:31,530
What I want is expel Chen Ye Hui from Glory!

420
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:35,160
Glory is not your instrument of vengeance!

421
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:37,630
I don't care about all this.

422
00:29:37,630 --> 00:29:41,033
What I do care is why you play Glory.

423
00:29:42,170 --> 00:29:44,480
I want to show my dad.

424
00:29:45,190 --> 00:29:47,210
I want to show you.

425
00:29:47,870 --> 00:29:54,190
I want to show everyone that thinks
I'd cheat and looks down on me!

426
00:30:00,910 --> 00:30:03,340
If what you want is show to others,

427
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:06,100
you don't deserve to be part of Glory.

428
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:07,970
I won't throw you out.

429
00:30:08,690 --> 00:30:11,330
You let yourself out.

430
00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:14,153
Then tell me!

431
00:30:14,153 --> 00:30:16,244
What should I do?

432
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:23,000
You could go on.

433
00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:25,360
Or you could give up.

434
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:28,110
I don't even have a chance.

435
00:30:28,110 --> 00:30:30,360
How could I go on?

436
00:30:40,750 --> 00:30:43,910
You could because I'm your captain.

437
00:30:46,830 --> 00:30:48,470
Captain...

438
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:52,220
 

439
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:56,290
Why are you taking
Glory as your instrument of vengeance?

440
00:30:57,490 --> 00:31:04,280
Ye Qiu... What you owe me is not just Glory.

441
00:31:05,190 --> 00:31:08,140
Hui, Congrats! You've defeated
Qiu Fei and joined Team 1.

442
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:11,510
Hui, will you live upstairs
where Team 1 players live?

443
00:31:11,510 --> 00:31:12,550
Yep.

444
00:31:12,550 --> 00:31:14,990
I've heard they live in separate rooms. Is it true?

445
00:31:14,990 --> 00:31:16,428
Yep.

446
00:31:16,428 --> 00:31:17,960
That's great!

447
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:20,710
Okay. I know you'll miss me.

448
00:31:20,710 --> 00:31:22,310
But we are still in the same building.

449
00:31:22,310 --> 00:31:24,420
You can come visit me.

450
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:25,510
Okay.

451
00:31:25,510 --> 00:31:27,990
By the way, try your best.

452
00:31:27,990 --> 00:31:29,310
You'll move upstairs one day.

453
00:31:29,310 --> 00:31:30,430
Go for it.

454
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:32,470
Thank you!

455
00:31:33,630 --> 00:31:34,860
We'll try our best.

456
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:36,620
- Better opportunities will come.
- Yes!

457
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:38,666
Go for it!

458
00:31:43,004 --> 00:31:47,840
 

459
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:49,980
Chen Ye Hui...

460
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:52,260
You really hope Ye Qiu will be my enemy?

461
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:53,750
We shouldn't wait for Qiu Fei.

462
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:56,053
Maybe he's not coming.

463
00:31:57,300 --> 00:32:00,710
Qiu Fei hasn't come. Cancel the plan.

464
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:02,280
It's meaningless.

465
00:32:09,610 --> 00:32:11,250
You said...

466
00:32:12,573 --> 00:32:14,951
you'd give me one more chance, right?

467
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:21,480
Where is Ye Qiu?

468
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:23,060
Where is he?

469
00:32:27,510 --> 00:32:32,770
In District 10. His ID is Jun Mo Xiao.

470
00:33:22,330 --> 00:33:23,710
Great.

471
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:26,030
You've made big progress
during the half-year training.

472
00:33:26,030 --> 00:33:28,440
None of your business.

473
00:33:37,550 --> 00:33:39,350
Not good enough in predicting
and judging the situation.

474
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:42,330
Saw me using Dragon Tooth,
you shouldn't react with Chaser.

475
00:33:49,750 --> 00:33:53,190
You've learned Vanishing
Step, but it's not perfect.

476
00:33:53,190 --> 00:33:54,790
That requires more experience.

477
00:33:54,790 --> 00:33:57,215
Need more training and experience.

478
00:35:13,310 --> 00:35:16,110
Good! You've improved your Vanishing Step.

479
00:35:16,110 --> 00:35:17,670
But did you miscount your Double Hit?

480
00:35:17,670 --> 00:35:19,710
Are you done?

481
00:35:19,710 --> 00:35:22,430
Since you have left Jia Shi,

482
00:35:22,430 --> 00:35:26,540
save the crap for your new team players!

483
00:35:37,050 --> 00:35:41,550
I never... only looked you as a team player...

484
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:45,870
Then why did you desert from Jia Shi?

485
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:52,990
He gave up Jia Shi.

486
00:35:52,990 --> 00:35:55,630
He also gave up everyone here, including you.

487
00:35:55,630 --> 00:35:58,030
Even if we can understand what he's done,

488
00:35:58,030 --> 00:36:00,030
what is he doing now?

489
00:36:00,030 --> 00:36:02,450
He has betrayed Jia Shi.

490
00:36:03,670 --> 00:36:07,030
Qiu Fei. He told us one thing before.

491
00:36:07,030 --> 00:36:10,550
Glory should never be anyone's
instrument of vengeance.

492
00:36:10,550 --> 00:36:12,990
But he is taking advantage of Glory.

493
00:36:12,990 --> 00:36:16,366
By establishing his own team,
he's against Jia Shi everywhere.

494
00:36:17,270 --> 00:36:18,710
He's in Xing Xin Net Cafe across the road.

495
00:36:18,710 --> 00:36:20,870
We can go with you.

496
00:36:22,630 --> 00:36:24,777
It's between Ye Qiu and me.

497
00:36:25,370 --> 00:36:27,630
None of your business.

498
00:36:40,750 --> 00:36:42,390
  Where is Ye Qiu?

499
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:45,150
Where is Ye Qiu?

500
00:36:45,150 --> 00:36:46,817
Over there.

501
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:54,910
What are you doing here?

502
00:36:54,910 --> 00:36:56,750
Don't you play Glory because you love it?

503
00:36:56,750 --> 00:36:59,350
Won't you get tired for 10 more years?

504
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:03,270
You didn't mean it?

505
00:37:03,270 --> 00:37:05,140
Manager, I lost connection!

506
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:07,450
- Come and check!
- Coming! Just a sec.

507
00:37:07,450 --> 00:37:09,850
Hurry up! I'm fighting against Boss!

508
00:37:12,190 --> 00:37:13,750
I'm talking to you!

509
00:37:13,750 --> 00:37:15,940
- I dropped!
- Hold it for me.

510
00:37:24,870 --> 00:37:27,240
- Fixed?
- Nope.

511
00:37:31,550 --> 00:37:32,480
How about now?

512
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:34,130
It's okay now.

513
00:37:35,050 --> 00:37:36,780
Ye Qiu.

514
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:39,190
Manager, a cup of tea, please.

515
00:37:49,610 --> 00:37:51,640
- Here you are.
- Thanks!

516
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:01,000
You had a good life abroad.

517
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,030
You've grown much taller!

518
00:38:04,550 --> 00:38:06,650
I thought you were a chef before.

519
00:38:07,550 --> 00:38:09,670
Now others see you as a net manager.

520
00:38:10,870 --> 00:38:12,390
Same old trick.

521
00:38:12,390 --> 00:38:14,030
Speaking of the net manager...

522
00:38:14,030 --> 00:38:15,726
I am one now.

523
00:38:21,310 --> 00:38:23,450
Haven't played it for a long time. Want to?

524
00:38:23,450 --> 00:38:24,951
One round.

525
00:38:30,990 --> 00:38:34,630
It's not easy to save the ball...

526
00:38:36,070 --> 00:38:38,590
If two balls in the same
color are at the entrance,

527
00:38:38,590 --> 00:38:42,837
you'll pot by pushing it with the ball behind.

528
00:38:42,837 --> 00:38:45,390
But we have a difficult situation here.

529
00:38:45,390 --> 00:38:47,390
Two balls do not belong to the same party.

530
00:38:47,390 --> 00:38:49,270
If you want to pot...

531
00:38:49,270 --> 00:38:51,270
you'll have to choose your own path.

532
00:38:51,270 --> 00:38:54,190
I wouldn't join you if it was just pushing balls.

533
00:38:54,190 --> 00:38:56,220
Look at the position.

534
00:38:56,220 --> 00:38:59,090
If I can figure out my own path,

535
00:38:59,090 --> 00:39:01,360
it'll be easy to save it.

536
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:03,770
You wanna try here?

537
00:39:07,750 --> 00:39:11,200
Wanna stroke it with full strength?

538
00:39:17,602 --> 00:39:19,390
Good plan!

539
00:39:20,330 --> 00:39:22,390
They went different ways.

540
00:39:22,390 --> 00:39:24,390
Everything in its place.

541
00:39:25,530 --> 00:39:28,900
Good plan or bad... Depends on where you aim.

542
00:39:30,990 --> 00:39:32,350
Again.

543
00:39:33,070 --> 00:39:34,710
Try here.

544
00:39:42,110 --> 00:39:45,240
It's doesn't matter if you have a ball to push.

545
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:47,190
Focus on the present.

546
00:39:47,190 --> 00:39:50,700
You'll see the future directions more clearly.

547
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:52,220
What...

548
00:39:53,970 --> 00:39:55,708
What are your future directions?

549
00:39:55,708 --> 00:39:57,390
I...

550
00:39:58,990 --> 00:40:01,070
I just want to play billiards for now.

551
00:40:07,406 --> 00:40:11,690
That's all I want, too.

552
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:16,730
Why are you working as a
net manager in such a place?

553
00:40:18,550 --> 00:40:23,610
If you want to start over, you can pick any team.

554
00:40:23,610 --> 00:40:26,030
Because there are people who love Glory.

555
00:40:26,750 --> 00:40:28,733
Glory is their whole world.

556
00:40:28,733 --> 00:40:30,860
What does this have to do with you?

557
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:35,110
I'm just one of them.

558
00:40:35,110 --> 00:40:36,971
- We've passed!
- Made it!

559
00:40:36,971 --> 00:40:38,722
- Great! 
 -Good job!

560
00:40:38,722 --> 00:40:41,040
Not easy!

561
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:42,637
Don't forget.

562
00:40:43,273 --> 00:40:45,650
You were one of them before.

563
00:40:50,550 --> 00:40:52,320
Captain...
