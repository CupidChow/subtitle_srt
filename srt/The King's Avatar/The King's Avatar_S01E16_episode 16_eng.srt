 "Light From the Ashes" - Cai Weize 

2
00:00:02,270 --> 00:00:06,200
♫  Countless fireflies born from insignificance  ♫

3
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:10,060
♫  Riding the long wind to gather into a shining galaxy  ♫

4
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:14,040
♫  Proclaim to the world on top of the sky  ♫

5
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:19,100
♫  We will return in glory  ♫

6
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:23,800
♫  Clear the clouds and descend with the heat  ♫

7
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:27,200
♫  Melting ice and snow, overcoming twists and turns  ♫

8
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:31,200
♫  Finally at this moment of peak  ♫

9
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:35,290
♫  There is a figure that coincides with the past  ♫

10
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:39,030
♫  The glory of the past that never came  ♫

11
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:42,650
♫  The pride that the future will never pass  ♫

12
00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:46,420
♫  Our fingertips intertwined and condensed  ♫

13
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:50,330
♫  Into a song that ignited the battlefield  ♫

14
00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:54,100
♫  The only light in an endless night  ♫

15
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:58,030
♫  Is you and me who overcame mediocrity  ♫

16
00:00:58,030 --> 00:01:01,880
♫  Up on the clouds and down in the dust  ♫

17
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:05,570
♫  Fireflies making every effort to illuminate  ♫

18
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:09,530
♫  I came from the legend to carry on a legend  ♫

19
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:13,530
♫  Once it's disruptive, a decade of persistence won't be in vain  ♫

20
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:17,320
♫  Up on the clouds and down in the dust  ♫

21
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:21,020
♫  Fireflies making every effort to illuminate  ♫

22
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:24,800
♫  Fireflies making every effort to illuminate  ♫

23
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:28,200

27
00:02:08,376 --> 00:02:10,200
 I hope one day, 

28
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:14,016
 the Myriad Manifestation Umbrella can reach the summit of Glory. 

29
00:02:47,536 --> 00:02:50,136
You have so much free time? Waiting for me here?

30
00:02:50,136 --> 00:02:51,896
I am very busy, okay?

31
00:02:51,896 --> 00:02:54,336
Take that! Take that! Take that!

32
00:03:04,956 --> 00:03:07,936
 You are here to accompany your captain and try out the weapon, right? 

33
00:03:07,936 --> 00:03:10,256
I'm here to accompany Shaotian.

34
00:03:49,456 --> 00:03:52,936
I must say. Isn't this welcoming ceremony a bit too solemn?

35
00:03:52,936 --> 00:03:56,196
"Welcoming"? You are overthinking it.

36
00:03:56,196 --> 00:03:59,116
After cowardly admitting retirement was your own choice,

37
00:03:59,116 --> 00:04:01,776
how could you expect people to line up and welcome you?

38
00:04:09,336 --> 00:04:10,616
Step aside. Step aside. Step aside.

39
00:04:10,616 --> 00:04:12,877
Fighting him should be first-come, first-served, all right?

40
00:04:12,877 --> 00:04:14,376
Hey, Old Ye, I have a question.

41
00:04:14,376 --> 00:04:16,656
Is this the final form of your Myriad Manifestation Umbrella?

42
00:04:16,656 --> 00:04:19,937
What new tricks does it have? Quickly show me.

43
00:04:20,876 --> 00:04:22,456
How could I let you guys see through me?

44
00:04:22,456 --> 00:04:24,396
That's all for today. I'm logging off.

45
00:04:25,596 --> 00:04:27,036
I haven't asked you the most important question.

46
00:04:27,036 --> 00:04:29,616
So many people are waiting for your answer. You can't leave like that.

47
00:04:29,616 --> 00:04:32,656
What's the real point of your statement? Make it clear.

48
00:04:35,376 --> 00:04:36,516
 There's nothing to say. 

49
00:04:36,516 --> 00:04:38,656
 I just don't want to let my old friend down. 

50
00:04:40,556 --> 00:04:42,276
 Thanks for coming, guys. 

51
00:04:42,276 --> 00:04:43,856
 It's time to leave. 

52
00:04:43,856 --> 00:04:46,276
 With so many masters crowded in the Heavenly Domain, 

53
00:04:46,276 --> 00:04:48,356
 aren't you afraid it'll cause a frenzy? 

54
00:04:48,356 --> 00:04:50,876
 I hope to see you all in the competition arena. 

55
00:04:50,876 --> 00:04:52,436
Old Ye, you're coming back, aren't you?

56
00:04:52,436 --> 00:04:55,216
Right? Right? Right? Old Ye!

57
00:04:57,796 --> 00:04:59,656
That's more like it.

58
00:05:07,856 --> 00:05:09,476
Welcome back to Heavenly Domain.

59
00:05:09,476 --> 00:05:12,016
 - May Glory be with you and never let it end. 
 - Welcome back to Heavenly Domain. 

60
00:05:12,016 --> 00:05:13,416
 May Glory be with you. 

61
00:05:13,416 --> 00:05:15,016
 - Welcome back to Heavenly Domain. 
 - Never let it end. 

62
00:05:15,016 --> 00:05:17,536
 - May Glory be with you. 
 - Glory. Never let it end. 

63
00:05:17,536 --> 00:05:20,896
 May Glory be with you and never let it end. 

64
00:05:36,956 --> 00:05:41,096
I will be back. It won't be long.

65
00:05:54,620 --> 00:06:00,540
   

66
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:02,350
   

67
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:04,936
Why did he return good for evil?

68
00:06:07,656 --> 00:06:09,056
Let me tell you. To observe a grandmaster,

69
00:06:09,056 --> 00:06:10,836
you can't just focus on his glamorous appearance.

70
00:06:10,836 --> 00:06:14,896
Underneath it, there could be an ugly heart.

71
00:06:14,896 --> 00:06:18,356
What does he plan to do next?

72
00:06:18,356 --> 00:06:20,956
After leaving the old team, he must be looking to join a new one.

73
00:06:20,956 --> 00:06:22,916
To find a better team.

74
00:06:24,436 --> 00:06:28,556
But he is already the best.

75
00:06:28,556 --> 00:06:30,956
Bun, time to work.

76
00:06:33,376 --> 00:06:34,636
Why did you bring them out?

77
00:06:34,636 --> 00:06:36,607
Don't you see our boss is sad about the unethical decision

78
00:06:36,607 --> 00:06:38,916
that Ye Qiu made?

79
00:06:39,756 --> 00:06:42,956
- He plans to build his own team! 
 - What?

80
00:06:42,956 --> 00:06:45,296
You want to build your own team?

81
00:06:46,456 --> 00:06:49,376
You betrayed your team and lied to your fans!

82
00:06:49,376 --> 00:06:51,616
Now, you're even building your own team!

83
00:06:51,616 --> 00:06:55,696
Boss, such scum should be broken into pieces.

84
00:06:55,696 --> 00:06:57,536
What are you doing?

85
00:06:57,536 --> 00:06:59,576
No need to say anything. I get it.

86
00:06:59,576 --> 00:07:00,856
I will take care of this.

87
00:07:00,856 --> 00:07:03,056
Out of sight, out of mind.

88
00:07:03,056 --> 00:07:05,620
Do you know who Ye Qiu is?

89
00:07:06,336 --> 00:07:08,156
Ye Qiu is, of course, Ye Qiu.

90
00:07:08,156 --> 00:07:10,256
Don't tell me he is Ye Xiu.

91
00:07:18,896 --> 00:07:20,576
Captain!

92
00:07:23,556 --> 00:07:24,936
To observe a grandmaster,

93
00:07:24,936 --> 00:07:28,036
you can't just focus on his glamorous appearance.

94
00:07:28,036 --> 00:07:30,636
Underneath it,

95
00:07:30,636 --> 00:07:33,736
there could be an even brighter heart.

96
00:07:35,376 --> 00:07:39,256
How dare a noob like me curse our captain,

97
00:07:39,256 --> 00:07:41,016
say bad things about our captain...

98
00:07:41,016 --> 00:07:45,416
I should be broken into pieces.

99
00:07:45,416 --> 00:07:48,376
What can I do for him?

100
00:07:50,396 --> 00:07:52,387
To be his team member?

101
00:07:54,516 --> 00:07:56,436
I can be his boss!

102
00:07:57,636 --> 00:07:59,256
Boss...

103
00:08:02,996 --> 00:08:04,676
I think it's quite likely.

104
00:08:04,676 --> 00:08:06,636
No, it's unlikely.

105
00:08:06,636 --> 00:08:09,936
How could he allow me to be his boss?

106
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,400
Likely...

107
00:08:13,056 --> 00:08:15,176
Still unlikely.

108
00:08:18,156 --> 00:08:20,896
Shakespeare Bun!

109
00:08:20,896 --> 00:08:22,696
Boss, my bad!

110
00:08:22,696 --> 00:08:24,537
Listen! Your salary for this month, next month,

111
00:08:24,537 --> 00:08:26,876
until the end of this year is all gone!

112
00:08:39,036 --> 00:08:40,696
I've printed the photos for you.

113
00:08:40,696 --> 00:08:42,356
Let me see.

114
00:08:43,236 --> 00:08:45,196
Do you want the domineering CEO style?

115
00:08:49,116 --> 00:08:51,716
How about an elegant, noble style?

116
00:08:55,416 --> 00:08:56,696
That's not me, is it?

117
00:08:56,696 --> 00:08:58,296
Of course, it's you.

118
00:08:58,296 --> 00:09:00,726
The teenager version.

119
00:09:00,726 --> 00:09:02,396
How about this one?

120
00:09:02,396 --> 00:09:04,796
Do you want the fresh and cute style?

121
00:09:07,376 --> 00:09:09,416
Any other choices?

122
00:09:12,036 --> 00:09:15,676
Then... I pick the cute one.

123
00:09:16,976 --> 00:09:18,496
We'll go with this one.

124
00:09:18,496 --> 00:09:21,176
For the Challengers League, it's better to use the formal one.

125
00:09:22,416 --> 00:09:25,676
Can we destroy the remaining ones now?

126
00:09:27,196 --> 00:09:28,796
Whatever makes you happy.

127
00:09:28,796 --> 00:09:31,216
I have the originals at home anyway.

128
00:09:31,216 --> 00:09:34,496
Whenever I need these photos, I can print more.

129
00:09:35,036 --> 00:09:36,756
There won't be such a need.

130
00:09:36,756 --> 00:09:38,136
Of course, there is.

131
00:09:38,136 --> 00:09:41,796
For example, when I want to tease you, satirize you,

132
00:09:41,796 --> 00:09:43,936
and get back at you.

133
00:09:49,536 --> 00:09:51,776
To get back to the League, a team is necessary.

134
00:09:51,776 --> 00:09:54,396
To build a team, a guild is necessary.

135
00:09:54,396 --> 00:09:56,556
To create a guild, having enough members is necessary.

136
00:09:56,556 --> 00:09:58,336
Are you sure you can handle all that stuff?

137
00:09:58,336 --> 00:09:59,636
Not sure.

138
00:09:59,636 --> 00:10:00,436
So?

139
00:10:00,436 --> 00:10:01,536
I need a boss.

140
00:10:01,536 --> 00:10:03,116
Have you found one?

141
00:10:04,116 --> 00:10:06,236
There's someone who is suited for the job.

142
00:10:06,236 --> 00:10:08,756
What advantages does this person have?

143
00:10:08,756 --> 00:10:10,316
This person's been a boss before.

144
00:10:10,316 --> 00:10:11,816
It doesn't count.

145
00:10:11,816 --> 00:10:13,116
Practice makes perfect.

146
00:10:13,116 --> 00:10:15,136
Have you asked this person?

147
00:10:15,136 --> 00:10:18,476
It's the same profession, same type of work, and the interest is there.

148
00:10:18,476 --> 00:10:20,576
There is no reason to say no.

149
00:10:20,576 --> 00:10:22,976
Do you know what you look like now?

150
00:10:22,976 --> 00:10:24,796
Blindly optimistic.

151
00:10:24,796 --> 00:10:26,916
Daydreaming.

152
00:10:30,776 --> 00:10:32,356
Ye Xiu,

153
00:10:34,916 --> 00:10:38,556
a new year, means a new start for both of us.

154
00:10:40,636 --> 00:10:42,376
Look!

155
00:10:42,376 --> 00:10:44,556
The world agrees with me.

156
00:10:51,676 --> 00:10:55,356
New year, new start.

157
00:11:28,476 --> 00:11:31,656
I am worn out. Finally, the training is over.

158
00:11:31,656 --> 00:11:33,716
We can get some good rest now.

159
00:11:34,296 --> 00:11:35,836
- How have you been feeling recently? 
 - Not bad.

160
00:11:35,836 --> 00:11:37,516
Two beverages, please.

161
00:11:39,776 --> 00:11:41,876
Team Tiny Herb is recruiting.

162
00:11:42,476 --> 00:11:44,976
Yifan, bootcamp is coming to an end soon. 
    

163
00:11:44,976 --> 00:11:46,856
Are you returning to Tiny Herb?

164
00:11:51,936 --> 00:11:54,016
I want to train some more.

165
00:11:58,996 --> 00:12:03,416
Yifan didn't participate in the evaluation test at all.

166
00:12:06,816 --> 00:12:09,676
Obviously, my test matters more.

167
00:12:10,296 --> 00:12:11,816
What score did he get?

168
00:12:11,816 --> 00:12:15,556
Negative points for Assassin and zero for Phantom Demon.

169
00:12:17,276 --> 00:12:19,896
Just zero.

170
00:12:19,896 --> 00:12:24,696
Didn't both of us also start from zero?

171
00:12:25,816 --> 00:12:28,996
Zero is the starting point.

172
00:12:32,456 --> 00:12:35,576
Is this why you came looking for me today?

173
00:12:35,576 --> 00:12:38,476
Do you want Yifan to join you?

174
00:12:39,616 --> 00:12:42,476
"The wildflowers dazzlingly blind people."* 
  (*Tang Dynasty Bai Juyi's poem) 

175
00:12:44,216 --> 00:12:47,116
It's exactly talking about your uneven eyes.

176
00:12:47,116 --> 00:12:50,816
But I never pick the wrong flowers or wrong team members.

177
00:12:50,816 --> 00:12:56,916
But still, thank you for helping Yifan find his starting point.

178
00:12:57,876 --> 00:13:02,016
Finding the starting point is easy, but getting to the end is not.

179
00:13:02,016 --> 00:13:06,156
I will help him reach the end.

180
00:13:08,836 --> 00:13:10,096
It won't be easy returning to the League.

181
00:13:10,096 --> 00:13:13,496
How about joining Team Tiny Herb?

182
00:13:13,496 --> 00:13:16,856
No problem, as long as you let me become captain.

183
00:13:16,856 --> 00:13:17,976
No problem,

184
00:13:17,976 --> 00:13:20,756
as long as you switch from Unspecialized to Witch.

185
00:13:22,076 --> 00:13:25,516
No, I am not a fan of Tiny Herb's Green.

186
00:13:25,516 --> 00:13:28,136
Don't tell me you still prefer Excellent Era's Red.

187
00:13:28,136 --> 00:13:30,296
I want my own color.

188
00:13:30,296 --> 00:13:32,056
What's your plan?

189
00:13:32,056 --> 00:13:33,616
I already told you.

190
00:13:33,616 --> 00:13:34,816
I am going to be a captain.

191
00:13:34,816 --> 00:13:36,556
Of which team?

192
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:39,516
I will build my own team.

193
00:13:39,516 --> 00:13:42,296
It's difficult leading a team full of newbies.

194
00:13:42,296 --> 00:13:45,356
I never do anything that's easy.

195
00:13:45,356 --> 00:13:49,456
True. You're old now, after all.

196
00:13:49,456 --> 00:13:52,216
It's time for you to train your successors.

197
00:13:55,176 --> 00:13:59,396
Don't get anxious. Retirement is imminent.

198
00:13:59,396 --> 00:14:01,636
Seniors first.

199
00:14:02,536 --> 00:14:03,976
Before that, I will defeat you first.

200
00:14:03,976 --> 00:14:05,236
No need.

201
00:14:05,236 --> 00:14:09,296
Someday, the newbies will surpass all of us.

202
00:14:09,296 --> 00:14:12,536
Newbies are the future of Glory.

203
00:14:15,496 --> 00:14:18,816
How about I evaluate your newbies?

204
00:14:18,816 --> 00:14:24,070
Sure, let me show you my home ground.

205
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:26,530
   

206
00:14:26,530 --> 00:14:29,956
I don't like Wang Jiexi's interview.

207
00:14:29,956 --> 00:14:32,976
It's too formal with no talking points. 
    

208
00:14:32,976 --> 00:14:36,156
He said Team Tiny Herb's goal is to take the championship.

209
00:14:36,156 --> 00:14:39,316
Isn't that every team's goal?

210
00:14:39,976 --> 00:14:41,236
You make a good point.

211
00:14:41,236 --> 00:14:42,756
Right?

212
00:14:46,276 --> 00:14:48,716
You two look quite similar.

213
00:14:56,656 --> 00:14:58,696
Don't tell me you're...

214
00:14:58,696 --> 00:15:01,556
Team Tiny Herb's captain, Wang Jiexi.

215
00:15:02,596 --> 00:15:04,496
This is our...

216
00:15:04,496 --> 00:15:08,196
Hi, I am the boss of this internet cafe, Chen Guo.

217
00:15:09,476 --> 00:15:11,456
How are you?

218
00:15:12,616 --> 00:15:15,516
Our boss is just too friendly. You will get used to it.

219
00:15:15,516 --> 00:15:20,376
Hello. I will reflect on what you just mentioned.

220
00:15:20,976 --> 00:15:25,336
By the way, this is Tang Rou, the owner of Soft Mist.

221
00:15:26,056 --> 00:15:29,196
Your play style is similar to Ye Qiu's.

222
00:15:30,056 --> 00:15:34,136
I am flattered, but I am me and nobody else.

223
00:15:35,136 --> 00:15:36,896
Let's have a look inside.

224
00:15:36,896 --> 00:15:39,036
Feel free to look around.

225
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:49,656
Xiao Tang, I think we should change the name of our internet cafe.

226
00:15:49,656 --> 00:15:51,056
To what?

227
00:15:51,056 --> 00:15:54,736
It should be called "Heavenly Domain."

228
00:15:58,316 --> 00:16:02,436
Look. Even Captain Jiexi dropped by.

229
00:16:02,436 --> 00:16:05,616
Other grandmasters will come by soon, too.

230
00:16:07,536 --> 00:16:10,316
It seems they are old friends.

231
00:16:19,936 --> 00:16:24,756
Do you think that Jiexi will snatch our grandmaster away?

232
00:16:26,616 --> 00:16:30,716
No way! I need to go and have a look.

233
00:16:30,716 --> 00:16:33,456
Ready to act your part?

234
00:16:33,456 --> 00:16:35,176
I'll try.

235
00:16:39,456 --> 00:16:40,976
Come here.

236
00:16:49,356 --> 00:16:52,096
So this is the place you mentioned?

237
00:16:52,096 --> 00:16:55,356
Right. Everything is ready except the east wind.

238
00:16:55,356 --> 00:16:56,996
What east wind?

239
00:16:58,376 --> 00:17:00,436
A capable boss.

240
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:02,116
It is hard to find a good one.

241
00:17:02,116 --> 00:17:03,736
There is a huge risk in building a new team.

242
00:17:03,736 --> 00:17:06,396
I suggest you give up this idea.

243
00:17:06,396 --> 00:17:09,916
As I said, I don't like doing easy things.

244
00:17:09,916 --> 00:17:11,616
You should just join Team Tiny Herb.

245
00:17:11,616 --> 00:17:13,136
It's impossible to be a captain,

246
00:17:13,136 --> 00:17:14,796
but you can at least be in the starting lineup.

247
00:17:14,796 --> 00:17:15,816
How about that?

248
00:17:15,816 --> 00:17:17,996
I will think about it.

249
00:17:17,996 --> 00:17:20,376
Your age is an issue.

250
00:17:20,376 --> 00:17:22,096
Only a few years left for you.

251
00:17:22,096 --> 00:17:25,556
Why exhaust yourself over building a new team?

252
00:17:28,536 --> 00:17:29,976
I will think about it carefully.

253
00:17:29,976 --> 00:17:33,216
Why not just hang around, then retire after a few years?

254
00:17:33,216 --> 00:17:37,776
We treat retiring team members much better than Excellent Era.

255
00:17:37,776 --> 00:17:39,436
- Really? 
 - Yes.

256
00:17:40,976 --> 00:17:41,996
I will think about it seriously.

257
00:17:41,996 --> 00:17:44,116
What are you thinking about?

258
00:17:46,396 --> 00:17:48,356
Why did you come here today?

259
00:17:52,116 --> 00:17:54,336
- Am I wrong? 
 - Of course!

260
00:17:54,336 --> 00:17:56,376
Isn't he old?

261
00:17:56,376 --> 00:17:58,456
Isn't it too hard to build a team?

262
00:17:58,456 --> 00:18:00,536
Isn't it better to join Team Tiny Herb?

263
00:18:00,536 --> 00:18:02,636
Can he find a good boss?

264
00:18:08,076 --> 00:18:09,716
- Yes, he can. 
 - Who?

265
00:18:09,716 --> 00:18:11,296
Me!

266
00:18:15,896 --> 00:18:18,296
Boss, stop kidding around.

267
00:18:18,296 --> 00:18:19,636
It's not easy to build a new team.

268
00:18:19,636 --> 00:18:21,676
I am not kidding.

269
00:18:23,396 --> 00:18:25,836
I've been thinking about it for a long time.

270
00:18:27,696 --> 00:18:30,136
I was just afraid you wouldn't think I was qualified.

271
00:18:33,496 --> 00:18:35,036
A little bit.

272
00:18:35,036 --> 00:18:38,896
To be the boss of a team, you need to have a high IQ and EQ.

273
00:18:38,896 --> 00:18:40,656
Do you think you have them both?

274
00:18:41,896 --> 00:18:45,856
Building a team is no child's play, right?

275
00:18:45,856 --> 00:18:46,896
Right.

276
00:18:46,896 --> 00:18:49,676
Don't make a hasty decision just because of your sudden impulse.

277
00:18:49,676 --> 00:18:53,717
Once it's started, there's no turning back.

278
00:18:58,736 --> 00:19:00,596
I will never give up.

279
00:19:05,636 --> 00:19:07,816
I will never give up.

280
00:19:12,216 --> 00:19:14,336
Never give up.

281
00:19:16,016 --> 00:19:18,116
Is she really a good choice?

282
00:19:21,596 --> 00:19:24,176
We all started from zero.

283
00:19:24,176 --> 00:19:28,076
Things can't get any worse.

284
00:19:29,796 --> 00:19:32,396
Did I do my part well?

285
00:19:33,176 --> 00:19:36,716
Not bad... as an extra.

286
00:19:46,096 --> 00:19:54,576
Xiao Tang, have... have you taken an IQ test before?

287
00:19:55,456 --> 00:19:56,816
I have.

288
00:19:56,816 --> 00:19:58,016
What score did you get?

289
00:19:58,016 --> 00:19:59,656
One hundred and thirty.

290
00:20:01,796 --> 00:20:03,616
One hundred and thirty.

291
00:20:04,716 --> 00:20:07,756
I could probably get 130, too.

292
00:20:09,496 --> 00:20:12,656
Do you think I have a high EQ?

293
00:20:13,376 --> 00:20:15,396
Can you see through others?

294
00:20:19,776 --> 00:20:22,776
Didn't I make Grandmaster our network admin?

295
00:20:22,776 --> 00:20:25,136
So maybe I can't.

296
00:20:27,496 --> 00:20:29,756
Can you control yourself?

297
00:20:31,596 --> 00:20:35,276
I think I can.

298
00:20:35,276 --> 00:20:39,616
Are you focused, patient, and thoughtful?

299
00:20:41,516 --> 00:20:44,756
I think I am quite thoughtful.

300
00:20:48,136 --> 00:20:53,436
Guo Guo, building a team is something very serious.

301
00:20:53,436 --> 00:20:55,316
This isn't something to joke about.

302
00:21:06,496 --> 00:21:08,496
I've thought of how to build the team.

303
00:21:09,936 --> 00:21:10,737
How?

304
00:21:10,737 --> 00:21:13,056
I have money and passion.

305
00:21:14,116 --> 00:21:16,376
Money and passion are not enough.

306
00:21:16,376 --> 00:21:19,856
Can you endure the hardships, sleepless nights, and setbacks?

307
00:21:19,856 --> 00:21:21,576
Absolutely.

308
00:21:23,136 --> 00:21:24,756
I don't buy it.

309
00:21:33,396 --> 00:21:35,836
Put them away. They are quite valuable.

310
00:21:49,456 --> 00:21:54,616
To build a team, we need to at least have a guild and pass the certification test.

311
00:21:54,616 --> 00:21:57,136
We'll talk more after those two tasks are done.

312
00:21:59,116 --> 00:22:01,456
I will prove myself to you!

313
00:22:04,516 --> 00:22:06,116
I am waiting.

314
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:13,140
   

315
00:22:14,130 --> 00:22:17,016
 I can finally fulfill my esports dream. 

316
00:22:17,016 --> 00:22:19,376
 I began to nervously prepare for the upcoming battle. 

317
00:22:19,376 --> 00:22:24,710
 This time, I am definitely going to prove I am qualified enough. 

318
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:29,960
   

319
00:22:43,056 --> 00:22:45,556
Still have an analysis to read?

320
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:22,730
   

321
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:31,550
   

322
00:23:31,556 --> 00:23:34,550
- There are rewards for scanning the code. 
 - Really? Let's scan it.

323
00:23:34,550 --> 00:23:36,256
Join Invincibly the Most Handsome Guild. 
    

324
00:23:36,256 --> 00:23:38,076
There are rewards for scanning the code.

325
00:23:38,076 --> 00:23:40,016
Let's scan the code.

326
00:23:55,976 --> 00:24:00,747
301 members, time for the next level.

327
00:24:00,747 --> 00:24:02,707
   

328
00:24:04,616 --> 00:24:08,076
Guardian? Okay, all done. 
    

329
00:24:10,716 --> 00:24:12,436
Go ahead.

330
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:27,880
Here.

331
00:24:28,856 --> 00:24:29,896
Is the guild ready?

332
00:24:29,896 --> 00:24:32,776
"Invincibly the Most Handsome."

333
00:24:32,776 --> 00:24:33,656
Registered for the test?

334
00:24:33,656 --> 00:24:35,576
The clock is ticking.

335
00:24:35,576 --> 00:24:39,837
- That confident? 
 - Ready for whatever is coming. Cheers!

336
00:24:43,936 --> 00:24:47,776
After I finish the test and you guys defeat the Guardian,

337
00:24:47,776 --> 00:24:52,976
we can hold a party and enjoy a big dinner.

338
00:24:53,856 --> 00:24:55,756
The Guardian?

339
00:24:56,556 --> 00:24:59,556
After we finish this mission, our guild can upgrade.

340
00:24:59,556 --> 00:25:03,516
Once our guild reaches 1,000 members, we can build a team.

341
00:25:04,536 --> 00:25:06,416
When did you accept the mission?

342
00:25:07,156 --> 00:25:09,176
Just now.

343
00:25:10,856 --> 00:25:15,096
Did you know we have to finish the Guardian mission in two hours?

344
00:25:15,936 --> 00:25:18,756
What if we fail?

345
00:25:20,756 --> 00:25:22,776
The guild will be disbanded.

346
00:25:23,836 --> 00:25:26,216
We only have two opportunities to challenge the Guardian.

347
00:25:26,216 --> 00:25:28,640
We only have one and a half hour left.

348
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,410
   

349
00:25:30,410 --> 00:25:31,416
Are you all ready?

350
00:25:31,416 --> 00:25:32,916
- Ready. 
 - Ready.

351
00:25:56,496 --> 00:25:58,376
 This is the Unicorn Guardian. 

352
00:25:58,376 --> 00:25:59,696
 We have to try our best 

353
00:25:59,696 --> 00:26:03,096
 to defeat it within the limited time, to keep our guild. 

354
00:26:04,156 --> 00:26:08,596
 We have no choice but to fight with everything we've got. 

355
00:26:28,230 --> 00:26:30,150
   

356
00:26:58,196 --> 00:26:59,856
Boss.

357
00:27:03,696 --> 00:27:07,836
Boss, if you want to help, just go upstairs.

358
00:27:07,836 --> 00:27:11,096
I think I should not cause more trouble for them.

359
00:27:14,136 --> 00:27:20,056
Xiao Chu, we will win. Right?

360
00:27:20,056 --> 00:27:23,516
Brother Ye is such a master, so it won't be a problem.

361
00:27:23,516 --> 00:27:25,256
Exactly.

362
00:27:26,636 --> 00:27:30,116
We have a few elite players in our guild after all.

363
00:27:30,116 --> 00:27:32,336
The Guardian mission is a piece of cake.

364
00:27:32,336 --> 00:27:34,536
Not to mention one and a half hours,

365
00:27:34,536 --> 00:27:36,216
I think half an hour is enough for them.

366
00:27:36,216 --> 00:27:40,116
Actually, we all have confidence in Brother Ye, but you don't seem to.

367
00:27:40,116 --> 00:27:42,796
Of course, I trust him!

368
00:27:45,436 --> 00:27:48,136
I am going to prepare food and drinks for them right now.

369
00:27:52,576 --> 00:27:54,717
We've been fighting for so long. Why doesn't its HP go down? 
    

370
00:27:54,717 --> 00:27:56,796
Look! The attack missed.

371
00:27:56,796 --> 00:27:58,616
What the hell are these noobs doing?

372
00:27:58,616 --> 00:27:59,896
How could that happen?

373
00:27:59,896 --> 00:28:01,056
Aren't they elite players?

374
00:28:01,056 --> 00:28:03,736
There are too many misses!

375
00:28:03,736 --> 00:28:05,260
This is intentional. 
    

376
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:07,180
   

377
00:28:15,050 --> 00:28:17,980
   

378
00:28:25,690 --> 00:28:28,010
   

379
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:40,890
   

380
00:28:44,896 --> 00:28:47,336
Don't bother to chase. It's no use.

381
00:28:49,536 --> 00:28:51,716
Why were there so many misses?

382
00:28:51,716 --> 00:28:55,036
 It seems our undercover plan works. 

383
00:29:03,336 --> 00:29:06,836
Ye Qiu obviously wants to build a team after creating the guild.

384
00:29:06,836 --> 00:29:09,856
Not only will he become Blue Brook Guild's opponent,

385
00:29:09,856 --> 00:29:12,796
but possibly even Team Blue Rain's.

386
00:29:16,176 --> 00:29:19,356
I understand. You're afraid I'd go soft on them.

387
00:29:19,356 --> 00:29:20,376
Don't worry.

388
00:29:20,376 --> 00:29:24,856
I will crush their guild by any means necessary.

389
00:29:24,856 --> 00:29:27,517
The Guardian is the largest barrier to upgrading the guild.

390
00:29:27,517 --> 00:29:29,936
They only have an hour left now.

391
00:29:29,936 --> 00:29:34,276
If they fail again, their guild will be forcibly disbanded.

392
00:29:34,276 --> 00:29:36,776
I didn't expect they took this mission without any preparation.

393
00:29:36,776 --> 00:29:38,676
It will only embarrass themselves.

394
00:29:38,676 --> 00:29:41,176
Their guild members are all noobs.

395
00:29:41,176 --> 00:29:46,736
They can only defeat it by using high-level players like us to deal enough output.

396
00:29:46,736 --> 00:29:48,876
As long as we remain undercover,

397
00:29:48,876 --> 00:29:51,856
even if given two more hours, they still won't complete it.

398
00:30:10,136 --> 00:30:12,176
I'm back.

399
00:30:27,176 --> 00:30:28,416
Bun, was it your mistake?

400
00:30:28,416 --> 00:30:29,816
Did you bring down the team again?

401
00:30:29,816 --> 00:30:30,936
Boss, I...

402
00:30:30,936 --> 00:30:32,756
No one made mistakes,

403
00:30:33,576 --> 00:30:35,196
except you.

404
00:30:35,936 --> 00:30:38,856
We've been working our ass off,

405
00:30:38,856 --> 00:30:41,876
to pay the price for your impulse.

406
00:30:41,876 --> 00:30:44,376
Guo Guo, this time you were too impulsive.

407
00:30:44,376 --> 00:30:49,256
You really should have asked us if we could finish it before taking on the mission.

408
00:30:49,256 --> 00:30:53,196
If we fail, our guild will be disbanded.

409
00:31:00,296 --> 00:31:01,916
It's not a big deal.

410
00:31:01,916 --> 00:31:05,656
We can create another one in a few days.

411
00:31:26,456 --> 00:31:29,256
If you want to be build a team, I won't stop you.

412
00:31:29,936 --> 00:31:34,396
But have you ever thought if you are qualified enough?

413
00:31:45,896 --> 00:31:48,916
To build a team, and create a guild,

414
00:31:48,916 --> 00:31:52,316
a lot of people are indeed better than me.

415
00:31:54,016 --> 00:31:56,496
Compared with them,

416
00:31:56,496 --> 00:31:58,816
I am truly unqualified.

417
00:31:58,816 --> 00:32:01,196
The reason why they are better than you,

418
00:32:01,196 --> 00:32:03,897
is not because they are more intelligent or more capable.

419
00:32:03,897 --> 00:32:08,396
It is simply that you forecast your failure before taking action.

420
00:32:17,136 --> 00:32:20,236
Since that's what you believe and they agree with you,

421
00:32:20,236 --> 00:32:22,356
I'll just quit.

422
00:32:23,996 --> 00:32:27,756
At worst, I'll just quit being the team's boss.

423
00:32:31,876 --> 00:32:35,096
It's not the first time you have given up halfway anyway.

424
00:32:35,096 --> 00:32:40,016
Since you want to quit, don't bother pushing yourself,

425
00:32:40,016 --> 00:32:42,796
and no need to take the coming test.

426
00:32:46,856 --> 00:32:48,996
All right then!

427
00:33:01,216 --> 00:33:03,210
Hurry up! Let's try again.

428
00:33:03,210 --> 00:33:04,930
   

429
00:33:07,616 --> 00:33:09,296
Although most of us are noobs,

430
00:33:09,296 --> 00:33:11,496
we already fought this dungeon once.

431
00:33:11,496 --> 00:33:13,416
I believe everyone is at least familiar with it.

432
00:33:13,416 --> 00:33:15,916
Next up, just follow my instructions.

433
00:33:15,916 --> 00:33:19,796
I hope we can succeed on our last attempt.

434
00:33:19,796 --> 00:33:23,196
Succeed? Are you kidding me?

435
00:33:23,196 --> 00:33:24,776
Just watch the guild disband.

436
00:33:24,776 --> 00:33:27,816
Brother Expert, I'm sorry.

437
00:33:27,816 --> 00:33:31,216
Don't tell me you feel sorry for your enemy and are reluctant to do it.

438
00:33:32,016 --> 00:33:34,836
You are thinking too much. Let's get started.

439
00:33:38,316 --> 00:33:39,656
Let's start.

440
00:33:39,656 --> 00:33:42,076
Cleansing Mist, shoot the Guardian at long range.

441
00:33:42,076 --> 00:33:44,356
Cleansing Mist and I are in charge of controlling the Guardian.

442
00:33:44,356 --> 00:33:47,116
Everybody else, deal as much output as you can!

443
00:33:47,116 --> 00:33:50,476
Be careful when attacking at a high speed.

444
00:33:56,956 --> 00:33:59,496
No wonder Su Mucheng is Glory's top launcher.

445
00:33:59,496 --> 00:34:02,356
Her Delivery Gun skill is incredible.

446
00:34:04,176 --> 00:34:06,216
 Dual Delivery Gun! 

447
00:34:07,070 --> 00:34:09,610
   

448
00:34:09,616 --> 00:34:10,936
The Guardian is not moving anymore.

449
00:34:10,936 --> 00:34:13,096
Captain, you are amazing!

450
00:34:13,096 --> 00:34:14,636
Fire.

451
00:34:35,496 --> 00:34:38,616
Take that! Tyrannical Chain Punch!

452
00:34:42,896 --> 00:34:45,056
What should we do now?

453
00:34:45,056 --> 00:34:46,876
Keep attacking. Just remember to miss the target.

454
00:34:46,876 --> 00:34:49,057
There are so many people attacking; no one will discover us.

455
00:34:49,057 --> 00:34:50,236
Attack the wall.

456
00:34:50,236 --> 00:34:51,556
Pretend we have missed attacks.

457
00:34:51,556 --> 00:34:53,456
Be careful to avoid hitting the Guardian.

458
00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:06,950
   

459
00:35:06,956 --> 00:35:08,527
Something is wrong.

460
00:35:08,527 --> 00:35:10,616
Why is the HP declining so slowly?

461
00:35:10,616 --> 00:35:13,136
They have too many missed attacks.

462
00:35:13,136 --> 00:35:15,036
What the hell are these noobs doing?

463
00:35:15,036 --> 00:35:15,976
The Guardian even stays still.

464
00:35:15,976 --> 00:35:17,656
How could they miss the target!

465
00:35:17,656 --> 00:35:19,936
Captain, what do we do?

466
00:35:19,936 --> 00:35:22,476
- Keep attacking. 
 - Roger that.

467
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:38,250
   
   

468
00:35:38,250 --> 00:35:41,016
No time left! No time left! No time left!

469
00:35:41,016 --> 00:35:43,796
Don't stop. Keep attacking.

470
00:35:45,296 --> 00:35:47,436
Why keep attacking?

471
00:35:47,436 --> 00:35:50,196
It's just a futile attempt.

472
00:35:50,196 --> 00:35:52,216
Everybody, it's close to the end.

473
00:35:52,216 --> 00:35:54,316
Let's work harder, and act our parts.

474
00:35:54,316 --> 00:35:56,056
Don't let Lord Grim figure it out.

475
00:35:56,056 --> 00:35:59,216
It's even better if you can break the wall.

476
00:36:12,910 --> 00:36:15,030
   

477
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:26,800
   

478
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:34,740
   

479
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:36,370
   

480
00:36:44,550 --> 00:36:46,570
   

481
00:36:51,696 --> 00:36:53,196
That's impossible.

482
00:36:53,196 --> 00:36:55,010
   

483
00:37:02,936 --> 00:37:04,796
We did it!

484
00:37:07,976 --> 00:37:13,196
 Congratulations to Invincibly the Most Handsome Guild on achieving the Guardian Power Buff. 

485
00:37:14,116 --> 00:37:16,336
Many thanks to all the undercover members.

486
00:37:16,336 --> 00:37:18,716
I bet you are pretty exhausted after attacking the wall.

487
00:37:18,716 --> 00:37:21,056
Do you want me to kick you guys off?

488
00:37:29,476 --> 00:37:32,036
Let's go and have a meeting.

489
00:37:34,476 --> 00:37:36,876
Why haven't you left their guild yet?

490
00:37:38,576 --> 00:37:41,616
Hurry up. Our captain is waiting.

491
00:37:48,620 --> 00:37:49,710
   

492
00:37:49,716 --> 00:37:51,696
 Blue River? 

493
00:37:55,096 --> 00:37:57,976
That battle was so satisfying!

494
00:37:57,976 --> 00:38:00,836
I really didn't expect the Guardian to die on its own.

495
00:38:00,836 --> 00:38:03,836
Tell me. Aren't we very lucky?

496
00:38:03,836 --> 00:38:05,256
We are not lucky at all.

497
00:38:05,256 --> 00:38:07,876
It is just a game of plot and counterplot.

498
00:38:08,796 --> 00:38:11,536
Plot? What are you saying?

499
00:38:12,296 --> 00:38:13,956
First, counterplot.

500
00:38:13,956 --> 00:38:16,856
Then exploiting the enemy's force.

501
00:38:16,856 --> 00:38:19,196
Counterplot?

502
00:38:19,196 --> 00:38:20,616
What did we exploit?

503
00:38:20,616 --> 00:38:22,336
In the end, a small move made a huge impact.

504
00:38:22,336 --> 00:38:24,136
Even the enemies were blinded.

505
00:38:24,136 --> 00:38:28,536
I have to say, the whole process is really interesting.

506
00:38:28,536 --> 00:38:30,476
It's... What?

507
00:38:30,476 --> 00:38:31,776
What? What?

508
00:38:31,776 --> 00:38:36,836
If you guys keep confusing him, Bun will end up killing himself out of frustration.

509
00:38:37,896 --> 00:38:39,036
What are you all talking about?

510
00:38:39,036 --> 00:38:40,197
Thanks.

511
00:38:40,197 --> 00:38:43,576
Those noobs were all undercover.

512
00:38:43,576 --> 00:38:45,316
Undercover?

513
00:38:48,396 --> 00:38:49,576
I see.

514
00:38:49,576 --> 00:38:53,416
They were all spies in our team!

515
00:38:53,416 --> 00:38:55,096
How dare they do this!

516
00:38:55,096 --> 00:38:58,096
But it's all thanks to them attacking the wall

517
00:38:58,096 --> 00:39:02,196
that we could use it to our advantage and kill the Boss.

518
00:39:02,196 --> 00:39:07,356
I bet Senior already thought of this tactic after we failed the first time.

519
00:39:07,356 --> 00:39:11,636
That's why you let them be in our second attempt.

520
00:39:11,636 --> 00:39:14,036
Senior, am I right?

521
00:39:14,036 --> 00:39:15,696
You're half correct.

522
00:39:15,696 --> 00:39:19,216
The person who had this idea was not me; it was Luo Ji.

523
00:39:19,216 --> 00:39:23,197
It's all thanks to him figuring out the DPS for crushing the wall is 103,245.6,

524
00:39:23,197 --> 00:39:26,536
much higher than the sum of the DPS of those eight spies,

525
00:39:26,536 --> 00:39:28,296
that I risked letting them be.

526
00:39:28,296 --> 00:39:31,576
Sorry, if I may interject. You forgot two decimal places.

527
00:39:31,576 --> 00:39:34,856
It should be 103245.618.

528
00:39:34,856 --> 00:39:35,976
Stop speaking, shut up.

529
00:39:35,976 --> 00:39:37,576
Whatever Captain says, goes. Got it?

530
00:39:37,576 --> 00:39:39,696
- 103245.618? 
 - Right.

531
00:39:39,696 --> 00:39:41,336
Okay, I got it.

532
00:39:41,836 --> 00:39:46,556
You had this all planned out, but you still made Guo Guo upset.

533
00:39:48,496 --> 00:39:51,196
- Cheers, for our boss. 
 - Come on.

534
00:39:51,996 --> 00:39:54,876
Let's wish her luck... on her test.

535
00:39:54,876 --> 00:39:57,496
Or wish her a miracle!

536
00:39:57,496 --> 00:39:58,916
Sounds good.

537
00:39:59,716 --> 00:40:02,156
- Come on. 
  - Cheers! 

538
00:40:08,296 --> 00:40:09,856
 The reason why they are better than you, 

539
00:40:09,856 --> 00:40:12,696
 is not because they are more intelligent or more capable. 

540
00:40:12,696 --> 00:40:17,196
 It is simply that you forecast your failure before taking action. 

541
00:40:23,096 --> 00:40:26,276
 If you want to build a team, I won't stop you, 

542
00:40:26,276 --> 00:40:30,016
 but have you ever thought if you were qualified enough? 

543
00:40:40,596 --> 00:40:44,200
 It's not the first time you give up halfway anyway. 

544
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:48,356
 Since you want to quit, don't bother pushing yourself.
