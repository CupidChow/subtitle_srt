 "Light From the Ashes" - Cai Weize 

2
00:00:02,260 --> 00:00:06,260
♫  Countless fireflies born from insignificance  ♫

3
00:00:06,260 --> 00:00:10,160
♫  Riding the long wind to gather into a shining galaxy  ♫

00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:13,950
♫  Proclaim to the world on top of the sky  ♫

♫  We will return in glory  ♫

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,730
♫  Clear the clouds and descend with the heat  ♫

7
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:27,370
♫  Melting ice and snow, overcoming twists and turns  ♫

8
00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:31,250
♫  Finally at this moment of peak  ♫

9
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:35,320
♫  There is figure that coincides with the past  ♫

10
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:39,100
♫  The glory of the past that never came  ♫

11
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:42,770
♫  The pride that the future will never pass  ♫

12
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:46,540
♫  Our fingertips intertwined and condensed  ♫

13
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:50,420
♫  Into a song that ignited the battlefield  ♫

14

♫  The only light in an endless night  ♫

15
00:00:54,230 --> 00:00:58,110
♫  Is you and me who overcame mediocrity  ♫

00:00:58,110 --> 00:01:01,970
♫  Up on the clouds and down in the dust  ♫

♫  Fireflies making every effort to illuminate  ♫

18
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:09,730
♫  I came from the legend to carry on a legend  ♫

19
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:13,540
♫  Once it's disruptive, a decade of persistence won't be in vain  ♫

20
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:17,390
♫  Up on the clouds and down in the dust  ♫

21
00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:21,200
♫  Fireflies making every effort to illuminate  ♫

22
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,810
♫  Fireflies making every effort to illuminate  ♫

23
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:28,210
   

24
00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:32,580
 

25
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,020
Okay. Come on, netizens!

26
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:37,440
Come and look!

27
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:38,680
Let me show you.

28
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:40,240
This is Xing Xin Team.

29
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:42,020
Look at how despicable they are!

30
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:43,820
What are you doing? Don't touch me!

31
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:47,040
Look at the camera. Say something.

32
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:49,950
- Sorry. Don't take videos.
- What are you doing? Don't move.

33
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:50,879
I know you're the vice captain.

34
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:53,341
Listen! Don't bully others with your gang!

35
00:01:53,341 --> 00:01:56,420
 

36
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:59,460
Come on. Say it again by looking at the camera.

37
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:00,740
- Young man. 
 -  Listen to me.

38
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:02,580
Don't cotton up with me.

39
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:07,740
You just said we fans of Jia Shi all went nuts.

40
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:14,360
The captain we supported the most before has established his own team now.

41
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:17,300
He rivals against his old team everywhere.

42
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:20,180
Do you understand how the fans feeling?

43
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:21,680
No one does.

44
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:32,100
You don't care about Jia Shi's fans, either?

45
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:37,820
I don't compete for the fans.

46
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:40,570
Not for the fans? Then for whom?

47
00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:42,540
To be honest,

48
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:46,940
what we are striving for
is a dream that is very personal.

49
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:50,090
Nobody does it for making others happy.

50
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:52,930
I hope you'll not misunderstand it.

51
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:57,080
We appreciate everything you've done for us. And we're touched.

52
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,440
But...

53
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:01,050
I need to tell you a ruthless fact.

54
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:04,810
It's not true if we say we'd compete for you.

55
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:07,380
At least I wouldn't.

56
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:09,120
Not at all.

57
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:14,890
But if it weren't for our support,
there would be no eSports circle.

58
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:18,020
And there would be no professional players.

59
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:19,590
You're right.

60
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:22,280
So I'm appreciated.

61
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:24,880
And I'm touched by your support.

62
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,900
I say it sincerely.

63
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:28,780
But it's my competition.

64
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:32,080
I don't do it for you.

65
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,240
It's totally different.

66
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:44,181
Brutal truth! Didn't know Master Ye Qiu is so direct.

67
00:03:44,181 --> 00:03:46,180
In only 10 seconds,
many have become his fans from the opposite.

68
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:48,340
- Exciting!
- Ye Qiu is not an idol star at all.

69
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:50,040
He's a real professional player.

70
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,260
Telling the truth is the best gift for fans.

71
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:54,010
That's the true sportsmanship.

72
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:02,280
You...

73
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:06,230
Your arrogance won't last long
before the competition against Jia Shi starts.

74
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,180
Captain. Captain.

75
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:13,660
You were awesome just now.

76
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:15,200
Finger heart.

77
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:20,370
Hi.

78
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:22,430
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

79
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:23,700
Captain.

80
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:27,740
I don't think you should say all that.

81
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:28,860
Though it was true.

82
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:31,250
Yes. He's just a fan.

83
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:33,010
Not worthy.

84
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:40,920
You're too naive.

85
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:44,620
I said it to all of you.

86
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:48,840
When you become real professional
players, you'll have many fans.

87
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:51,940
With their support and their encouragement,

88
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:55,060
knowing what they like and what they don't like,

89
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,580
will you be manipulated by those?

90
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:01,260
It's not something trivial.

91
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:02,920
It matters.

92
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:05,740
Why do you compete?

93
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:07,780
You should think thoroughly.

94
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:11,600
It may decide how long you
would travel on the journey

95
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,100
and how well you would play.

96
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:16,280
It's okay to compete for making the fans happy.

97
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:19,960
But it's difficult to win the
championship by doing it.

98
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:24,600
What fans like may not be the right things.

99
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:28,880
How you should play it depends on each of you.

100
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:32,840
Because you are professional players.

101

103
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:54,180
 

104
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:55,660
Master! You finally came back.

105
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:56,930
Please... look at this.

106
00:05:56,930 --> 00:05:59,780
News about our Xing Xin team
on line is bombarding everyone.

107
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:01,521
  Look. All kinds of different stories.

108
00:06:01,521 --> 00:06:03,510
Look, here.

109
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:05,190
What news? Just tell me.

110
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:06,820
Well...

111
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:09,380
It's difficult to say.

112
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:12,260
Do they want Xing Xin to
withdraw or ask him to apologize?

113
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:13,900
Neither.

114
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:15,300
They say...

115
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:18,410
They want to see the truest Master Ye Qiu.

116
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:23,650
I would say...

117
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:28,580
The word "silly" could
summarize Ye Qiu's entire life.

118
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:31,460
He could have been
enjoying his welfare in Jia Shi.

119
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:33,100
But he's chosen to have a hard life in Xing Xin.

120
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:34,780
What are you doing?

121
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:39,410
Editing a video.

122
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:44,170
He's not only a silly person,
but also has a one-track mind.

123
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:46,430
If someone like him wants
to return to the league...

124
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:47,640
Master. Let me explain.

125
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,780
We planned everything in advance.

126
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:52,260
As you know, self-deprecating
is the best way to whitewash.

127
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:54,480
So if we started with talking
about your weaknesses,

128
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:57,640
the audience will resonate with you.

129
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:59,300
Right?

130
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:05,620
If someone like him wants to return to the league,

131
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:07,960
he'd better go to a mature team to be the core.

132
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:08,660
Yes.

133
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:14,240
It's much better than to
babysit all the rookies here.

134
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,090
He's not a qualified captain.

135
00:07:16,090 --> 00:07:21,100
He's much worse in doing things
and conducting himself than me.

136
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:24,980
It was not self-deprecating.

137
00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:27,850
They were just complaining about me.

138
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:30,660
All true.

139
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:45,370
Questioning or flattering,
accepting or ostracizing,

140
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:47,680
they are not going to be our burdens.

141
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,490
To be specialized, dedicated and professional.

142
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:53,810
It's the attitude that an eSports player has.

143
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:57,000
We're continuing our journey.
 

144
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:02,980
In this stadium today,

145
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:05,160
we'll have two competitions
we pay high attention to.

146
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,170
They both won 6 times
successively in the Challenge.

147
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:10,200
Jia Shi and Xing Xin will
rival against others in order.

148
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,540
Jia Shi starts first.

149
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:15,130
And players in Xing Xin are entering the arena.

150
00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:17,420
- Don't make the same mistake.
- Boss Chen.

151
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:24,020
I'm the captain of Everlasting.

152
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:25,640
Wu Chen.

153
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:31,040
What's up?

154
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:33,530
I'm here to offer you a chance of cooperation.

155
00:08:34,730 --> 00:08:37,080
Cooperation?

156
00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:39,300
What cooperation?

157
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:43,220
As you see, Xing Xin and
Everlasting are in the same situation.

158
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:45,720
We're facing strong teams like Jia Shi.

159
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,340
We've got powerful enemies.

160
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:49,150
And we've got the same goal.

161
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:51,580
It is to win the champion of the Challenge.

162
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:53,820
How about we teaming up and fighting together?

163
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:55,510
Am I right?

164
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,420
Teaming up?

165
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:02,790
What do you mean?

166
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:04,620
I've been watching you for quite some time.

167
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:08,420
Some of your players are in good conditions.

168
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:11,130
But a team like Xing Xin
can't match with Everlasting

169
00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:15,390
because we've got better
equipment and environment.

170
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:19,000
If the two teams can merge into on team,

171
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,260
it will be a win-win opportunity
with might redoubled.

172
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:27,860
It is an honor for Xing Xin to merge with us.

173
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:31,300
After merging, we'll be the
new Everlasting together.

174
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:34,340
And you don't have to
compete in the Challenge today.

175
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:36,000
No need.

176
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:41,060
Thank you for considering us.

177
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:45,260
But Xing Xin has never
admitted defeat without fighting.

178
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:46,860
Thank you.

179
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:49,340
Think twice.

180
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:52,530
What really matters? Saving
face or the future of the team?

181
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:59,090
You're the captain of Everlasting.
Don't worry about our future.

182
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:11,760
To tell you the truth, I don't want to negotiate with Xing Xin.

183
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:15,160
I'm not interested in such a
grass-root team like you at all.

184
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:19,551
I don't want to see a professional player like Ye Qiu stops at the Challenge.

185
00:10:19,551 --> 00:10:21,290
Ye Qiu wants to return to the league.

186
00:10:21,290 --> 00:10:25,760
But Xing Xin is not the best
option for him from any respect.

187
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:30,590
If you lost, have you thought
how much Ye Qiu would lose?

188
00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:32,900
ESports players don't have
many years before retirement.

189
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:36,160
He should not waste his
time in such a crappy team.

190
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,510
Everlasting is a better option for him.

191
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:40,180
He's not going to Everlasting.

192
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:41,870
Can you decide for him?

193
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:43,340
She can.

194
00:10:45,170 --> 00:10:49,840
If you want to join Xing
Xin, we might consider it.

195
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:54,100
Otherwise, let's compete in the Challenge.

196
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:55,650
Let's go.

197
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:57,730
Go for it!

198
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:07,900
Welcome, everyone. It's the
competition field of the Challenge.

199
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:10,990
Our heroes for tonight will come right away.

200
00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:13,760
Welcome Xing Xin and Everlasting!

201
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,480
 

202
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:17,480
 

203
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:19,180
 

204
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:21,770
Xing Xin vs. Everlasting.

205
00:11:21,770 --> 00:11:24,350
The competition begins now!

206
00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:29,610
How awesome we played in the competition!

207
00:11:29,610 --> 00:11:32,220
Luring the enemy in deep and defeating them all!

208
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:33,660
Amazing!

209
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:36,500
Have we won seven times successively?

210
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:37,710
Listen to me.

211
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:41,100
I was inside. The captain
said we still needed to improve.

212
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:43,370
I think more training will come.

213
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:44,420
Seriously?

214
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:45,920
It could be true.

215
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:48,560
Oh, no. I'll take some rest now.

216
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:53,620
 
 

217
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:56,510
Speaking of successive wins,

218
00:11:56,510 --> 00:12:00,060
only we and Xing Xin haven't lost any competition.

219
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:03,440
So? You want to go watch Xing Xin?

220
00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:09,580
The one who wants to know
you best... is always your enemy.

221
00:12:14,570 --> 00:12:16,620
 
Congrats, Xing Xin! They won again.

222
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:19,960
They ended the first half with 5-0.
 

223
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:23,690
The Team Competition will start soon.

224
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,420
 

225
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:29,040
 

226
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:36,260
Okay. The players are ready.

227
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:38,060
The Team Competition is on the way.

228
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:43,900
Xing Xin vs. Everlasting.
The competition starts now!

229
00:12:58,220 --> 00:12:59,700
Sun Xiang.

230
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:09,370
You came to watch Xing Xin alone?

231
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:11,870
Who is watching them?

232
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:13,820
I'm watching...

233
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:15,980
I'm watching Everlasting.

234
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:20,840
You study Everlasting.

235
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:23,710
We study Xing Xin. We both study our rivals, right?

236
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:25,770
Facing the point-losing situation,

237
00:13:25,770 --> 00:13:27,890
Ruo Feng, what would you
suggest Everlasting and Wu Chen?

238
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:30,400
- Sure.
- If losing this game...

239
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:33,300
The one who wants to know
you best is always your enemy.

240
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:36,260
Wu Chen needs to step up at the
crucial moment to lead the team.

241
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:37,880
- He must be stressed out.
- Exactly.

242
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:42,290
In the first half, Xing Xin
was sailing with the wind.

243
00:13:42,290 --> 00:13:46,860
- What are you doing?
- Watch the game aboveboard.

244
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:48,940
Your sight would be blocked by wearing a hood.

245
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:51,940
Let's expect their good
performances in the Team Competition.

246
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:53,390
Shut up!

247
00:13:53,390 --> 00:13:55,190
Go ahead.

248
00:13:55,190 --> 00:13:56,720
 

249
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,780
With such a cast,
neither is launching their Cleric first.

250
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:01,980
Seems it'll be an output battle. 
  

251
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:03,650
It is surprising. 
  

252
00:14:03,650 --> 00:14:07,850
Generally speaking,
rarely would teams put Clerics on bench.

253
00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:14,511
But what Xing Xin and Everlasting are doing
surprises everyone here.

254
00:14:14,511 --> 00:14:16,240
The map is the Poisoned Wolf Land﻿.

255
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,500
 

256
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:19,301
 
It's a very different map.

257
00:14:19,301 --> 00:14:22,140
It will be a horrifying battle.

258
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:25,740
Instructor Ruo Feng, brief us
about why the map is different.

259
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:26,980
Let me keep you all guessing.

260
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:30,980
We'll see why it's different when the game starts.

261
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:32,700
Count down on the Team Competition.

262
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:38,900
Five, four, three, two, one. Start!

263
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:46,100
Okay. It starts.

264
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:48,740
- Everlasting's captain...
- The Launcher is ready.

265
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:50,080
Roger that.

266
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:52,530
Captain. Where are you?

267
00:14:52,530 --> 00:14:54,140
In the map of the Poisoned Wolf Land,

268
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:55,660
everyone starts in a different place.

269
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:57,960
Look at your position.

270
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,460
All players start at various places.

271
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:04,700
They are scattered in different positions.

272
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:10,020
On the map, there is poisoned fog everywhere.

273
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:21,720
Oh, crap! What's this?

274
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:24,390
Yes. The Poisoned Wolf Land is an escaping map.

275
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:27,420
Poisoned fog will slowly spread
to the center from the periphery.

276
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:31,120
If you touched the poisoned
fog, you'd continually lose blood.

277
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,240
Poisoned fog spreads to
the center from the periphery.

278
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:35,580
The only safe battle field
is the center of the map.

279
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:38,670
Everyone meets together in
the center as soon as possible.

280
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:39,540
Gotcha.

281
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:42,340
- Bao Zi. Watch out. 
 - Roger that.

282
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:45,980
A real man can't fall down
at the same place two times.

283
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:49,380
Spotted Leopold, Everlasting's Warlock.

284
00:15:50,170 --> 00:15:52,380
Spotted Everlasting's Summoner.

285
00:15:57,420 --> 00:15:59,280
I found an exit!

286
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:00,060
What about Tang?

287
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:02,500
Spotted Everlasting's Knight Three-lives Knot.

288
00:16:07,970 --> 00:16:10,160
We're surrounded! Everlasting's Ninja is here.

289
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,380
Han Yan Rou is fighting against two now.

290
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:15,660
Spotted the fifth of Everlasting.

291
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:23,130
Everlasting wants to kill Tang
with two players by avoiding me.

292
00:16:23,130 --> 00:16:24,360
Tang, hold on!

293
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:26,540
- I'll back you up! 
 - Roger that.

294
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:29,500
Now Everlasting and Xing Xin
are engaging in a contact battle.

295
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:32,080
Windward Formation vs.
Leopold. Yi Cun Hui vs. Ice Wing.

296
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:34,270
Han Yan Rou vs. Three-lives
Knot and Heavenly Rage.

297
00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:37,330
Bao Zi, the Invader hasn't met with Dawn Rifle.

298
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:39,820
Seems Jun Mo Xiao has
been entangled with something.

299
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:41,480
Why are there six Everlasting players?

300
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:44,300
It's five. The captain encounters a Summoning Monster.

301
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:46,580
Tang is in danger.

302
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:49,420
Tang can handle this one-against-two.

303
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:51,380
On other common maps, maybe yes.

304
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:53,050
But today we've got the Poisoned Wolf Land.

305
00:16:53,050 --> 00:16:56,900
With one second delay,
the damage it'll cause is fatal.

306
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,980
Due to the specialty of this map,

307
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:00,960
players can't meet with their
teammates in a short time.

308
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:05,690
They can only get out of the
plight with their personal abilities.

309
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:16,380
On the other side, Yi Cun Hui
is against Summoner Ice Wing.

310
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:18,900
The key will be how he gets
rid of the Summoning Monster

311
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:21,080
and makes him switch into the Summoner.

312
00:17:40,770 --> 00:17:43,150
 

313
00:17:57,540 --> 00:17:58,760
Good job! Ghost Step!

314
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:01,410
A successful switch into the Summoner!

315
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:22,200
We see Yi Cun Hui is moving.

316
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:25,290
He's realized he needs to
meet with his teammates soon.

317
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,560
Phantom of Dragon Tooth! Such a bilocation!

318
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:40,580
How fast she should be!

319
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:42,390
Tang Rou has got an amazing APM.

320
00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:45,160
With great personal strength,
she defeated the Ninja successfully.

321
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,570
Tang Rou! Tang Rou!

322
00:18:46,570 --> 00:18:49,740
Hard to imagine the new
player could grow so quickly!

323
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:51,890
Tang Rou, Tang Rou! 
  

324
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:02,900
Bao Zi, the Invader, was
going closer to his teammates.

325
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:04,160
He got hit by a long-distance launching.

326
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:07,380
Who did it? Who raided me?

327
00:19:14,150 --> 00:19:16,000
It was Dawn Rifle who ambushed on a highland.

328
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,440
He used far shot to constantly
attack Bao Zi, the Invader.

329
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:23,900
Hit him again! Bao Zi, the Invader's blood volume has been dropping.

330
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:25,500
But seems he hasn't located where his enemy is.

331
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:26,920
Hard for him to dodge Dawn Rifle's attack.

332
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:28,560
With the dropping speed of his blood volume,

333
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:31,700
in dozens of seconds, he'll lose all his blood.

334
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:44,370
The visibility of the map is very poor.

335
00:19:44,370 --> 00:19:48,180
But Dawn Rifle could accurately
Blind Snipe Bao Zi, the Invader.

336
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:49,600
How surprising!

337
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:52,300
Seems Dawn Rifle is in a
very good condition today.

338
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:56,080
Wu Chen is Blind Sniping in
fog.

339
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:59,210
His hit rate is ridiculously high!

340
00:19:59,210 --> 00:20:02,000
You smelt a rat, too?

341
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,300
If it were me, I couldn't do it.

342
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:21,280
Bao Zi, the Invader, position(144, 571).

343
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:25,700
Good! Another Blind Snipe!

344
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:27,340
Dawn Rifle killed Bao Zi,
the Invader successfully!

345
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:31,460
Everlasting eliminated on rival first. Xing Xin's substitute is in.

346
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:34,550
 

347
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:40,690
Be careful. The competition isn't over. We can't lose it.

348
00:20:40,690 --> 00:20:42,150
Yes, captain!

349
00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:46,280
Next target: Han Yan Rou.

350
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:47,600
Roger that.

351
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:50,000
Han Yan Rou, position(134, 231).

352
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,420
I'm afraid Xing Xin could be in danger.

353
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:54,600
He's about to shoot. Look who he's aiming at.

354
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,420
It's Han Yan Rou.

355
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,700
Jun Mo Xiao found where Dawn Rifle is.

356
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:02,660
He intervened in time and helped Han Yan Rou out.

357
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:04,900
Jun Mo Xiao stepped up at the crucial moment.

358
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:07,700
When did your shooting become so accurate?

359
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:09,040
How did you find me?

360
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:10,900
There is only one highland on this map.

361
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:12,800
Launchers will fight for it.

362
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,200
If you can't figure it out,

363
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:16,500
I'd say you are detached
from the Alliance for too long.

364
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:21,680
Han Yan Rou is being attacked by two.

365
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:25,040
But with strong personal
strength, she is not in disadvantage.

366
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:27,560
But how long could she hold
on in such a bloody battle?

367
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:31,360
If no one backed her up,
she might lose much blood.

368
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,200
The Warlock of Everlasting is here.

369
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:52,600
A very difficult situation of one-against-three!

370
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:54,300
Her teammates, come soon!

371
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:57,540
Or Han Yan Rou could be killed!

372
00:21:57,540 --> 00:21:59,160
 

373
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:26,970
Yi Cun Hui arrives at the front
and backs up Han Yan Rou in time.

374
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:29,820
- You okay? 
 - Yes. I can hold on.

375
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:40,200
We are in disadvantage. Meet with the captain now.

376
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:42,420
Han Yan Rou and Yi Cun Hui made a breakthrough

377
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:45,120
by seizing the moment
their enemies were positioning.

378
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:49,780
Everlasting players are right after them, not letting go of a power play.

379
00:23:20,550 --> 00:23:22,940
- Gate of Death! Good job!
- Perfect timing.

380
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:25,210
The four of Everlasting are under control.

381
00:23:25,210 --> 00:23:26,980
Xing Xin players are tacitly cooperating.

382
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:30,260
Han Yan Rou and Yi Cun Hui lured
Everlasting players to the position.

383
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:33,090
Windward Formation resets the
ultimate to control the enemies.

384
00:23:33,090 --> 00:23:35,600
Windward Formation shows up in time! Xing Xin players have assembled.

385
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:39,590
If everything goes well, Gate of Death will kill the four of Everlasting one time.

386
00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:41,861
Yes. Everlasting is in great danger.

387
00:23:41,861 --> 00:23:43,460
The four at the front are under control.

388
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:45,720
Its captain Dawn Rifle is held down
by Jun Mo Xiao.

389
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:49,200
If there is no miracle,
Everlasting will be defeated.

390
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:18,550
 

391
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:26,900
It's over.

392
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:30,740
 

393
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:32,141
What happened? What's going on?
 

394
00:24:32,141 --> 00:24:35,300
What happened? What's going on?

395
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:37,280
- What's wrong?
- What happened?

396
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:40,560
 
Be calm, please. We're checking what caused it.

397
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,500
What happened?

398
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:50,390
What? What just happened?

399
00:24:50,390 --> 00:24:53,210
 
Referee! What happened? We almost won!

400
00:24:53,210 --> 00:24:53,961
  What the heck?

401
00:24:53,961 --> 00:24:56,280
Dear audience, please be calm.

402
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:59,560
After checking, we've found
something wrong with the network.

403
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:02,000
 
Our staff are try to fix it as soon as possible.

404
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,500
So, when the competition starts again, we'll have 10 seconds backward.

405
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:08,200
If they have 10 seconds backward,
Wei's ultimate will be a waste.

406
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:11,240
Why will they make it 10 seconds backward? We were absolutely winning!

407
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:13,100
It's the rule of the league.

408
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:15,420
If an irresistible force caused
the competition to pause,

409
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:18,300
When it starts again, it will
have 10 seconds backward.

410
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:22,200
When it has 10 seconds backward,
everyone retreats immediately.

411
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:24,330
Pay attention to where
Windward Formation ambushes.

412
00:25:24,330 --> 00:25:25,780
Xing Xin has lost one player.

413
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:28,840
As long as we maintain
our strength, we'll win at last.

414
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:30,340
Got it?

415
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:32,260
Captain.

416
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:34,820
Why did we lose connection at such a time?

417
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:36,900
Maybe some network problem.

418
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:38,600
But...

419
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:40,410
How coincidental it was!

420
00:25:40,410 --> 00:25:42,020
I don't believe it's just a coincidence.

421
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:44,360
It must be the Everlasting bastards!

422
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:48,260
Whether or not they were
cheating, we only have one option.

423
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:49,450
We must win.

424
00:25:49,450 --> 00:25:53,000
Hello, audience! Now we've
got the connection back.

425
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:56,100
All players, please go back to your seats.

426
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:58,650
Our competition is about to start.

427
00:25:58,650 --> 00:26:00,760
Okay. Ladies and Gentlemen,
the connection is back.

428
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:03,750
We are now having 10 seconds back.

429
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:15,290
 

430
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:19,100
Let's continue. As expected,
Dawn Rifle retreats immediately.

431
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:21,260
Gate of Death didn't hit them.

432
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:22,940
Seems Everlasting is changing their strategy.

433
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:25,180
They're retreating. What they want is to stall.

434
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:28,560
And to win the competition by a power play.

435
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:31,430
 

436
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:51,150
The array of ice! Xing Xin chooses to go after Everlasting.

437
00:26:51,150 --> 00:26:53,790
They want to control and drag
the enemies into the poisoned fog.

438
00:26:53,790 --> 00:26:54,990
They are locked in a tangled fight.

439
00:26:54,990 --> 00:26:56,760
But we've seen how tacit Xing Xin players are.

440
00:26:56,760 --> 00:27:01,081
Facing a three-against-four fight, it isn't disadvantage with their tacit cooperation.

441
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:04,700
Watch out!

442
00:27:09,170 --> 00:27:11,430
 

443
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:16,800
Both sides are in the poisoned fog.

444
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:18,520
Will Everlasting win by a power play?

445
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:20,200
Or will Xing Xin win by their tacit teamwork?

446
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:22,500
The competition is over.

447
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:24,890
Everlasting wanted to play dirty.

448
00:27:25,490 --> 00:27:28,120
But they picked a wrong rival.

449
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:33,560
 

450
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:35,250
 

451
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:45,190
Xing Xin! Xing Xin! Xing Xin!

452
00:27:45,190 --> 00:27:48,000
It's Xing Xin! All three players
break through the poisoned fog.

453
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,200
Incredible! Only such a good cooperation

454
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:53,480
  could ace enemies
in the poisoned fog without losing anyone.

455
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:55,700
Xing Xin made it!

456
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:57,400
Now Everlasting's substitute is in.

457
00:27:57,400 --> 00:28:00,750
But only Dawn Rifle is left at the front.

458
00:28:02,610 --> 00:28:06,210
 

459
00:28:11,110 --> 00:28:12,750
What happened?

460
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:23,110
Wu Chen.

461
00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:26,590
If you could not defeat Xing Xin this time,

462
00:28:26,590 --> 00:28:29,510
the investors would withdraw all their capital.

463
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:31,900
We can look for other investors.

464
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:36,360
Captain. Do we have a chance to go back to the league this year?

465
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:38,050
We lost by one point the first year.

466
00:28:38,050 --> 00:28:41,000
We'll have to start over for it.

467
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:44,280
The competition is way too brutal for each of us.

468
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:45,900
We were the runner-up the next year.

469
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:48,300
Always being a runner-up...

470
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:51,600
forces us to watch others
stand on the Champion podium.

471
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,600
Three successive years...

472
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:56,430
We can't waste any time with our age...

473
00:28:57,050 --> 00:28:59,340
If we lost the competition...

474
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:01,150
we should part our ways.

475
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:07,020
We will win this time.

476
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:11,050
Everlasting cannot be dissolved.

477
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:18,000
The competition will be over.
But Dawn Rifle hasn't given up.

478
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,600
Ten seconds left.

479
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:22,100
Five seconds.

480
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:24,300
Three seconds.

481
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:26,000
One second.

482
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:37,920
Congratulations! Xing Xin
won the competition by 10-1.

483
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:41,100
The reversal in the end showed
us Xing Xin's great cooperation.

484
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:43,500
Everlasting's captain, Dawn Rifle,
held on in the last few seconds.

485
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:47,270
It showed us the charm of eSports.

486
00:29:47,270 --> 00:29:48,940
 

487
00:30:00,170 --> 00:30:03,400
It's Everlasting's first
championship in the Challenge.

488
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:06,280
- Yeah! 
 - We will win for a second time and a third time...

489
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:10,200
Until we get the championship
trophy and return to the league.

490
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:13,000
If Everlasting survives, our morale keeps high,

491
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,240
we will create a miracle!

492
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:18,700
For us. For Everlasting. For Glory.

493
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:20,670
Go for it!

494
00:30:20,670 --> 00:30:22,090
When the Challenge is over,

495
00:30:22,090 --> 00:30:26,490
we'll bring our trophy and go
to the highest point of the city.

496
00:30:26,490 --> 00:30:30,200
Let's view the place where we've fought together.

497
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:43,200
Wait.

498
00:30:45,250 --> 00:30:47,730
We've never seen the city together.

499
00:30:47,730 --> 00:30:49,260
Why bother?

500
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:53,480
To make an announcement to the whole city

501
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:55,850
that Everlasting will be dissolved?

502
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:14,720
As the boss of Everlasting,

503
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:19,120
I'm sorry to announce the team

504
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:22,890
will be dissolved from today.

505
00:31:22,890 --> 00:31:25,940
- Do you have any plan for the future?
- What?

506
00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:28,000
They are being dissolved?

507
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,900
No wonder they played so dirty.

508
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:32,520
- Fight to win or die. 
 - How ruthless they are!

509
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:34,850
Ruthless to their rivals and themselves.

510
00:31:34,850 --> 00:31:38,570
They were competing just
now, and they are dissolved now.

511
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:43,710
They fought so hard to stand
out from hundreds of teams.

512
00:31:43,710 --> 00:31:45,240
And made their way to the Challenge.

513
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:47,020
It's half way now.

514
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:48,890
They are dissolved suddenly.

515
00:31:48,890 --> 00:31:52,220
How much time and energy they dedicated!

516
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:56,740
ESports will never look at
how much effort you've put in.

517
00:31:56,740 --> 00:32:00,350
It only looks at how powerful you are.

518
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:07,200
Captain Ye.

519
00:32:14,870 --> 00:32:16,470
Sorry.

520
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:18,810
I cheated.

521
00:32:18,810 --> 00:32:22,200
The disconnection. Outside calls.

522
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:24,100
All my fault.

523
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:26,060
You don't need to apologize to me.

524
00:32:26,060 --> 00:32:28,570
If you have time to apologize
and ask for forgiveness...

525
00:32:28,570 --> 00:32:30,750
I'd rather have a talk with you.

526
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:47,100
The Warlock's Cloth Armor
can increase the moving speed.

527
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:49,600
It's suitable for your Containment strategy.

528
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:53,260
And the Cleric's Defender
will buff the Health point.

529
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:55,100
And the shinobigatana...

530
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:57,080
It isn't very special.

531
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:59,440
But we made it by ourselves.

532
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:05,500
If it's okay...

533
00:33:06,130 --> 00:33:08,340
I hope you will not disassemble it.

534
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:18,470
Now the silver equipment is yours.

535
00:33:18,470 --> 00:33:21,090
To upgrade Xing Xin's strength
with Everlasting's equipment.

536
00:33:21,090 --> 00:33:23,150
I am happy.

537
00:33:28,490 --> 00:33:30,120
What about you?

538
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:34,300
The day before yesterday,
I sold our desks and chairs.

539
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:37,540
Yesterday I liquidated all the
money in our bank accounts.

540
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:42,610
Today I've sold you all
our weapons we fought with.

541
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:44,940
What's next?

542
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:46,970
I'll figure out a way to stay in Glory.

543
00:33:46,970 --> 00:33:48,600
How?

544
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:54,200
With your current status,
transferring to other guilds isn't easy.

545
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:58,250
Right.

546
00:33:58,250 --> 00:34:02,860
My physical strength is not as
competitive as younger players.

547
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:07,000
And I'm not as experienced as other veterans.

548
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,030
I do know that I'm in a dilemma.

549
00:34:09,030 --> 00:34:11,090
But I don't want to recede.
