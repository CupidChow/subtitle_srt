 "Light From the Ashes" - Cai Weize 

2
00:00:02,290 --> 00:00:06,260
♫  Countless fireflies born from insignificance  ♫

3
00:00:06,260 --> 00:00:10,100
♫  Riding the long wind to gather into a shining galaxy  ♫

4
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:13,980
♫  Proclaim to the world on top of the sky  ♫

5
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:18,850
♫  We will return in glory  ♫

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,830
♫  Clear the clouds and descend with the heat  ♫

7
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:27,410
♫  Melting ice and snow, overcoming twists and turns  ♫

8
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:31,200
♫  Finally at this moment of peak  ♫

9
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:35,300
♫  There is a figure that coincides with the past  ♫

10
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:39,070
♫  The glory of the past that never came  ♫

11
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:42,720
♫  The pride that the future will never pass  ♫

12
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:46,540
♫  Our fingertips intertwined and condensed  ♫

13
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:50,450
♫  Into a song that ignited the battlefield  ♫

14
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:54,220
♫  The only light in an endless night  ♫

15
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:58,090
♫  Is you and me who overcame mediocrity  ♫

16
00:00:58,090 --> 00:01:01,980
♫  Up on the clouds and down in the dust  ♫

17
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:05,810
♫  Fireflies making every effort to illuminate  ♫

18
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:09,640
♫  I came from the legend to carry on a legend  ♫

19
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:13,460
♫  Once it's disruptive, a decade of persistence won't be in vain  ♫

20
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:17,400
♫  Up on the clouds and down in the dust  ♫

21
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:21,190
♫  Fireflies making every effort to illuminate  ♫

22
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:24,910
♫  Fireflies making every effort to illuminate  ♫

23
00:01:24,910 --> 00:01:27,960
   

24
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:30,380
   

25
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:35,300
   

26
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:42,420
 Subtitles and Timing provided to you by💥🍥 TEAM 7️⃣ 🍥💥 @viki.com 

27
00:01:42,426 --> 00:01:44,120
You won again.

28
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:47,640
I just got lucky.

29
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:54,960
You are clearly very skilled.

30
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:59,000
Be restrained when one needs to be modest.

31
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,100
Show off when one needs to be prominent.

32
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:08,540
I... I really don't have any strategies.

33
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:11,560
You are experienced.

34
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:15,360
She didn't add me as a friend or accept the file.

35
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:19,220
What can I do? I'm also helpless.

36
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,800
Didn't add you as a friend, then instruct her with words and actions.

37
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,980
Didn't accept the file, then try other ways.

38
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:32,000
What can I do?

39
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,500
I'm also irritated.

40
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,240
But being irritated won't solve any problem.

41
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:39,260
Are you sure you can't finish the task?

42
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:41,160
I...

43
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:47,750
I'm sure under the instruction of my boss,

44
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:50,720
I can finish the task.

45
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,500
The deadline is within 24 hours.

46
00:02:54,500 --> 00:03:00,260
When time runs out, you either win... or you lose.

47
00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:48,610
   

48
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:56,880
These are the Glory World Rules I wrote.

49
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:04,000
   

50
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,800
- It's not a strategy guide. 
 - Just a brief overview of the game flow.

51
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:16,400
It doesn't show any achievements.

52
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,800
It's only a collection of hard-won insights.

53
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,500
I'm sorry.

54
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:24,700
I don't read manuscripts.

55
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,540
Give me.

56
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:34,300
What a crappy manuscript! Ditch it!

57
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,280
Tang, take your time.

58
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:41,520
Here. Have fun.

59
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:53,860
Brat, go back to work!

60
00:04:57,470 --> 00:05:01,740
   

61
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:05,800
   

62
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:16,840
   

63
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:23,400
Tang, you're so good now. You've progressed rapidly.

64
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,060
You needed 2 minutes to defeat me before.

65
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:27,100
Now it's less than 40 seconds.

66
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:28,500
In fact, it could be faster.

67
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:32,340
Did you take some magic pill or some miracle drug?

68
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:39,560
It couldn't be that manuscript.

69
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:43,240
I just flipped through it. There's nothing valuable inside.

70
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,920
You threw it away?

71
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,540
Where did you leave it?

72
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:48,440
At the bar.

73
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:17,130
   

74
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,400
Well...

75
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,620
Print out last month's statement.

76
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:26,020
I'll review it.

77
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:32,080
Boss, you always push me to finish tasks ahead of schedule.

78
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,240
So I finished it yesterday.

79
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:37,120
I used Microsoft Excel to summarize it.

80
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,760
Computer No. 47 in Section B is not working. Go and check it.

81
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:53,500
Boss, you keep reminding us to use computers to run the internet cafe.

82
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:57,200
We can sacrifice everything, but computers need to be in good condition.

83
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,280
So?

84
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:02,080
I fixed the computer in Section B as soon as it broke down.

85
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:07,400
Thanks to the mighty restart button.

86
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:16,100
Did the boss tell you to leave when you were supposed to disappear?

87
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:20,800
What? When should I disappear?

88
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,600
Now.

89
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,900
 Admin! 
   

90
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:31,520
Coming.

91
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:34,240
When did you become so efficient?

92
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:49,900
Okay.

93
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:09,700
This is the long-lost secret of Glory.

94
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:13,680
Tang read this and made great progress.

95
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,500
I don't expect the same thing.

96
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,900
I just want to look at it.

97
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,000
What is this?

98
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,360
Poached Eggs?

99
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:37,040
Did Tang learn about strategies or recipes?

100
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:39,541
 For a Z-Shake, 

101
00:08:39,541 --> 00:08:43,100
 the most crucial thing is controlling APM when moving and changing directions. 

102
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:46,000
What's this? Salted duck egg?

103
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,240
 Falling Flower Palm. 

104
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:50,880
 Though it's not a high-level skill, it gives a very strong knockback. 

105
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:54,320
 It creates space outside of your opponent's attack range. 

106
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:57,440
 In effect, it is an intimidating micro skill. 

107
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:08,200
Is this a teacup?

108
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:13,340
Why would there be cups?

109
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:21,020
Chaser*! 
  (*Battlemage skill that causes magic damage to enemies and a buff to himself) 

110
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:26,360
This must be the Chaser practiced by a Battlemage.

111
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:33,360
At this critical moment, my perceptions are essential.

112
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:37,600
 Sitting for too long is not good for your health. Combine work and rest. 

113
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,900
 At this point, please get up and have some tea. 

114
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:42,840
 Let's take a recess. 

115
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:49,370
   

116
00:09:53,090 --> 00:09:55,050
   

117
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,400
What are you talking about?

118
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:06,690
   

119
00:10:16,771 --> 00:10:19,221
I printed Lord Grim's gaming session log. 
    

120
00:10:19,221 --> 00:10:21,700
If you want to wait, you should at least follow his schedule.

121
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:24,800
Otherwise, your hope to meet him might end up in vain.

122
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:45,000
I'm tired of thinking about the plan.

123
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
How to arrange it?

124
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,400
Well...

125
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:52,200
Call the players in Team 1. I have a task for them.

126
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:59,300
How should we arrange the big plan?

127
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,500
 When shall we start the Boneyard quest we discussed? 

128
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:22,100
 So you're serious about it. 

129
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:25,200
No way, are you kidding me?

130
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:31,300
 Our players are ready. We're just waiting for you. 

131
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:33,380
 Don't bail on me. 

132
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:36,800
 No need to bother your players. I have my own team. 

133
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,600
 See you at the Boneyard in half an hour. 

134
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,700
His own team?

135
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:46,200
He's bringing a team of pros to help me.

136
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:56,100
Join me in raiding the Boneyard Dungeon?

137
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:58,600
Can we PK at the Boneyard?

138
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,680
There are plenty of opponents to practice with.

139
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:02,800
They're all quite fierce.

140
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,700
I'd love it.

141
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:07,200
Give it a try.

142
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:15,300
Guild Master, are these all pros?

143
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:21,080
Of course.

144
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:23,200
Look at the demeanor of this female Battlemage.

145
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:26,000
Very competitive.

146
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:29,700
   

147
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:32,340
It seems she's never raided dungeons.

148
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:37,720
These days, fewer and fewer masters are willing to coach noobs.

149
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,760
But for dungeon quests like this...

150
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,260
only one player from a different team can join.

151
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,560
You all have a chance next time.

152
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:45,560
Next time.

153
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,680
Look at this Brawler.

154
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:53,400
He looks very experienced.

155
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:56,800
Guild Master, isn't this the noob who joined

156
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,300
the fight against Blood Gunman Yagg?

157
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:04,400
He has no experience. He only went through all the tutorials.

158
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,940
Just looks like him.

159
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:13,100
Master, let's go.

160
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:15,300
Let's wait for one more player.

161
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:17,380
Look.

162
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:19,560
The master told us to wait for another player.

163
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:22,120
He must be a peerless master.

164
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:25,100
Skillful players always show up last.

165
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:27,500
Must be very powerful.

166
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:31,900
 She just registered yesterday. She's buying items now. 

167
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:36,800
Are you sure you guys can break the record?

168
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:40,300
Who's pushing my chair?

169
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:42,100
Who?

170
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,460
Well...

171
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:47,200
I'm going into the dungeon.

172
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:11,000
Can these two noobs play?

173
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,620
Bao Zi is making random moves.

174
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:15,720
He either kills a monster in ten seconds or two minutes.

175
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:17,840
Is he really skillful?

176
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:19,940
Soft Mist really hasn't been in any dungeon quests.

177
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:22,140
She has no idea what teamwork is.

178
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:28,100
Guild Master, the game is kind of messy.

179
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:31,000
Relax, don't panic. It's called strategy.

180
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:53,480
Where's the other player?

181
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:55,860
Where is the Launcher?

182
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:58,480
Why only four left? One's missing.

183
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,480
Bought so many weapons that he couldn't carry them?

184
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:03,700
The Launcher is unreliable.

185
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,980
Zombie Bailey is escaping. It will reach the Bone Dragon Abyss soon.

186
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:37,760
So unreliable.

187
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:40,640
Zombie Bailey has run away. Still shooting aimlessly.

188
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:43,880
Gosh! With a 0.1-second reaction time, she hits the target!

189
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:46,800
Who's standing on top of the Bone Dragon Abyss entrance?

190
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:50,200
Shooting Zombie Bailey to force it towards Lord Grim.

191
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,440
The umbrella turned into a spear.

192
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:54,760
That spear landed perfectly!

193
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:57,686
The way that launcher is controlling the pace is insane!

194
00:15:57,686 --> 00:16:00,200
90% of those capable of playing a launcher like this must be pro players.

195
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:04,200
Female Launcher Cleansing Mist...

196
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,800
Cleansing...

197
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:09,000
Could that be Su Mucheng?

198
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,840
Of course, it's her.

199
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:14,180
Helping our Blue Brook Guild with the dungeon is Su Mucheng.

200
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:19,500
Our guild master is awesome! He even got Su Mucheng to do a dungeon quest with our guild.

201
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:22,400
Don't mess around. With your shooting skills,

202
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:25,360
you won't always get this lucky.

203
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:28,240
Focus on our mission.

204
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,300
It's just a coincidence.

205
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:32,600
I thought she was Su Mucheng.

206
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:48,300
 Congratulations to Blue Brook Guild player Lord Grim, 

207
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:50,640
 Cleansing Mist, Steamed Bun Invasion, 

208
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:54,200
 Soft Mist and Blue River for breaking the record of Boneyard Quest. 

209
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:57,600
A new record! Did you hear that?

210
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:00,200
What did I just say?

211
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:02,720
This is the strategy that the master and I came up with.

212
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,200
You're so wise!

213
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:06,341
- Exactly! 
 - Yes, yes.

214
00:17:06,341 --> 00:17:09,540
   

215
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:14,897
   

216
00:17:14,897 --> 00:17:21,640
   

217
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:26,590
   

218
00:17:26,590 --> 00:17:28,700
 Lord Grim is awesome. 
   

219
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:30,300
 He broke records again. 

220
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:32,240
 10th Server record grand slam! 

221
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,960
 Respect to our master Lord Grim. 

222
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:36,800
Lord Grim is the most competitive master in history.

223
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:39,000
Blue Brook Guild dominates the charts.

224
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,820
If anyone breaks this record, I'll eat the keyboard.

225
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:47,401
Zombie Bailey would have fled if it weren't for my help.

226
00:17:47,401 --> 00:17:49,880
 My dear, that's the guild master of Blue Brook Guild. 

227
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:52,440
 He'll know it's you by just looking at how you play. 

228
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:53,580
If you hadn't changed how you play,

229
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:56,380
what would you have done if Excellent Era found out?

230
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:59,780
I'm not afraid. Pro players came to break the dungeon records.

231
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:02,400
How embarrassing would it be if the strong bullied the weak because of that?

232
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,220
Who would they believe if the word goes out?

233
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:07,020
You're talking about me.

234
00:18:22,530 --> 00:18:24,390
   

235
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:31,980
The new forms are unlocked.

236
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:33,640
Help me test it.

237
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:35,780
I won't go easy on you.

238
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:16,800
 This transformation is called Soul Purifying Spear. 

239
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:20,000
 It has an attack speed of 5, which makes it the fastest among all spears. 

240
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:30,820
 This transformation form is called Arbiter Rifle. 

241
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:32,580
 It is lightweight and has a strong recoil, 

242
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:34,960
 perfect for switching to Gunner class. 

243
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:47,540
 This transformation is called Heraldic Shield. 

244
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:49,720
 It evolved from the knight's shield 

245
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:53,500
 and can easily be used as a high defense, high-HP Priest class skill. 

246
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:55,300
 At the same time, it also... 

247
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:58,760
 has high magic resistance and a wide defense range. 

248
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:02,500
 It is a melee weapon for the Fighter Profession 

249
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:05,000
 All right, stop it. 

250
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,240
 It's because of this that we stole her hairpin a few days ago. 

251
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:13,380
 her rubber band yesterday, and her costume today. 

252
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:16,640
 You didn't use the word "stole" accurately. 

253
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:19,760
 This thing is shared amongst family members. 

254
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:23,860
 At most, it can be regarded as recycling to maximize its value. 

255
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:26,600
 Look at this hairpin and this rubber band. 

256
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,400
 Especially this costume. 

257
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,600
 Just the right amount of flexibility 

258
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:36,100
 Perfect. 

259
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,550
 Run! 

260
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:52,120
♫  But you gave your all to leave no regrets for me  ♫

261
00:20:53,320 --> 00:21:02,620
♫  You are like my exclusive detective  ♫

262
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:11,360
♫  Every movement and expression is seen by you  ♫

263
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:19,740
♫  In my heart is the most amazing you  ♫

264
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:24,400
♫  Some days time just slips away  ♫

265
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:28,800
♫  Other days it seems to stand still  ♫

266
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:37,200
♫  In my heart is the dearest you  ♫

267
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:41,660
♫  My constant, unwavering support  ♫

268
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:46,240
♫  And also my unbreakable vow  ♫

269
00:21:49,671 --> 00:21:51,240
Let's call it a day.

270
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:54,760
I'm going offline to train.

271
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:59,430
♫  Transform every mundane moment  ♫

272
00:21:59,430 --> 00:22:03,650
♫  Into captivating experiences  ♫

273
00:22:03,650 --> 00:22:12,060
♫  In my heart is the dearest you  ♫

274
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:16,390
♫  My everlasting source of pride  ♫

275
00:22:21,890 --> 00:22:28,650
♫  Being inseparable in this journey  ♫

276
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:39,000
It's better if we confirm the strategy for the tournament.

277
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,160
   

278
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:44,420
I already said at the tactical meeting, you just need to be my support.

279
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:47,000
Leave the rest to me.

280
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:52,720
If that is how you want to play, I have to remind you of a few things.

281
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,600
Team Blue Rains' Yu Wenzhou and Huang Shaotian,

282
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:57,740
-  they— 
 - This is not my first tournament.

283
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:08,300
Mucheng is here.

284
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,320
Captain.

285
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:18,480
What is it?

286
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,800
Well, you just became captain.

287
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:23,120
There's a new atmosphere both in and out of Excellent Era.

288
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:26,900
I think we should do a makeover with the interior decorations.

289
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:29,540
This is the new design sketch.

290
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:32,700
You can make these small decisions as you see fit.

291
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:35,350
Okay, I'll get someone to arrange it right away.

292
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:41,180
But there is one thing I haven't done well.

293
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:42,300
Say it.

294
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:45,260
Excellent Era is now on an upward trend.

295
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:50,140
Only the guild has not fit into this.

296
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:52,130
It's holding the captain back.

297
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:55,240
Is our guild's performance that bad?

298
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:57,360
It's because there's a master stirring things up.

299
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,640
He not only snatched several big guilds' first kills,

300
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:03,380
but he holds the no. 1 spot for dungeon records for long periods of time.

301
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,520
Dungeon record?

302
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,460
It's easy.

303
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:12,820
What kind of masters can be there in Glory?

304
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:17,500
So...

305
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:20,540
We will report our dungeon records to the team tomorrow.

306
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:24,200
It's definitely in the bag. No one can break them.

307
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,540
This is all thanks to everyone.

308
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:32,380
But what we have to do is keep working hard.

309
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:35,220
Take another dungeon record.

310
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:40,280
It's good your spirits are high.

311
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:43,400
It scared our new records down the board.

312
00:24:44,110 --> 00:24:47,970
   

313
00:24:53,570 --> 00:24:56,700
   

314
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:05,960
Three, two, one.

315
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:07,900
Start.

316
00:26:35,330 --> 00:26:38,060
   

317
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:41,880
 Congratulations Excellent Dynasty players Soaring Sky, 00 Kill,  

318
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:47,080
 Dream Dust, Center Forever, and Golden Incense for breaking the Boneyard Dungeon Record. 

319
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:50,940
 Time: 16 minutes 56.78 seconds. 

320
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:54,980
What are dungeon records for?

321
00:26:56,120 --> 00:27:00,200
They are for the Blue Brook Guild to break.

322
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:04,040
Everyone should be prepared.

323
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:08,520
I'll launch a new raid soon so we can break the dungeon record.

324
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:11,960
You'll have to work hard, too. Go work hard!

325
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:17,140
You can certainly do it.

326
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:33,100
Brother, your record is not that good.

327
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:35,560
It didn't even last for two days.

328
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:38,580
Is it too harsh to say so?

329
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:41,660
I can't say that.

330
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:45,920
Brother, the new records are all fragile.

331
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:48,300
You don't have to be too sad.

332
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:50,720
No. What if...

333
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:54,160
What if the master likes to challenge?

334
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:02,880
 Brother, what shameful message did you recall again? 

335
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:06,920
 Brother, do you need any items? 

336
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:08,880
 The guild got some new Strong Spider Silk. 

337
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:11,920
 Items? The more, the better. 

338
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:16,520
 Then one more dungeon? 

339
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:24,100
 But this time, let's talk about after-sales service. 

340
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:26,260
 You should have some warranty policy, right? 

341
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:29,380
 No warranty for such a product. 

342
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:32,900
 I saw the new record. 16 minutes 56.78 seconds. 

343
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:35,280
 It must be pro players. 

344
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:37,520
 And this result is already the limit. 

345
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:41,060
 It is almost impossible to break again. 

346
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:56,820
 Impossible? 

347
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:58,900
 Then our record is gone. 

348
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:03,280
 But I love looking for possibilities in the impossibility. 

349
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:12,770
 Sun Xiang led pro players to create a record of 

350
00:29:12,770 --> 00:29:15,160
 16 min 56.78 sec. 

351
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:17,320
 No matter how many times I simulate actual combat, 

352
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:20,940
 I can't find a way to speed up fights and cut the time. 

353
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:27,420
 Since we can't fight head-on, we'll find other ways. 

354
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:33,760
 But I still need a Blade Master. 

355
00:29:37,810 --> 00:29:39,950
   

356
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:54,300
Is this net cafe contracted by Ye Qiu?

357
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:56,528
There's a tournament tonight. I'll support Excellent Era.

358
00:29:56,528 --> 00:29:58,828
So obvious! Can't you tell it?

359
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:02,660
It is.

360
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:07,420
This is the life-size cardboard cutout I bought for tonight.

361
00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:09,420
The original size is exactly Ye Qiu's height.

362
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:12,640
Could you help me put it here?

363
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:13,960
Get it done.

364
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:16,860
Cardboard cutout.

365
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:22,640
The same height?

366
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:30,700
By the way, brat.

367
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:35,480
Which team do you think will win in tonight's tournament?

368
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:38,760
Boss, which team do you expect to win?

369
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:41,260
I think Excellent Era will lose.

370
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:44,600
It would be impossible for Excellent Era to win without Ye Qiu.

371
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:51,280
Well...

372
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:56,980
What are you hissing about?

373
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:59,151
I asked you which team would win, not disarm a bomb.

374
00:30:59,151 --> 00:31:01,840
Taking so long to answer. Forget it.

375
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:05,420
Put up all these posters later.

376
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:11,420
I want everyone coming to the net cafe today to be in Ye Qiu's eyes.

377
00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:12,840
Boss.

378
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:14,560
You have a good eye for these posters.

379
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:17,240
It's very sharp and unique. The cardboard cutout is well done.

380
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:18,980
Taller than Ye Qiu himself.

381
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:20,820
Garage Kits videos are also great.

382
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:22,980
Why don't we be thorough?

383
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:24,660
Let's change the password of the net cafe, too.

384
00:31:24,660 --> 00:31:29,600
Let's use "Ye Qiu is invincibly the most handsome."

385
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:43,360
Ye Qiu is invincibly the most handsome.

386
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:46,620
That's a good one.

387
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:50,260
I feel the vibe of the net cafe has changed.

388
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:53,460
You should know I just used rhetoric.

389
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:57,080
It's called irony.

390
00:31:58,220 --> 00:32:00,100
Deal.

391
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:03,460
The brat has made progress.

392
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:12,600
 This is the 16th game for the Glory Professional League this season. 

393
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:15,400
 Excellent Era will be against Blue Rain. 

394
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:19,860
Hello to the audience and friends who are watching live.

395
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:22,900
It's nice to meet you again. I am your old friend, Xiao Luo.

396
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:27,580
Please welcome the host team, Excellent Era!

397
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:32,840
The first one coming is the new captain of Excellent Era,

398
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:36,780
the rookie champion, Sun Xiang.

399
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:41,980
Coming next is the league's best Launcher, Su Mucheng.

400
00:32:41,980 --> 00:32:47,140
Let's welcome the challenger, Blue Rain!

401
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:55,340
Now coming is Yu Wenzhou, one of the four master tacticians.

402
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:59,640
The second is our Sword Saint, Huang Shaotian.

403
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:02,020
Let's see whether the new battle god, Sun Xiang,

404
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:05,820
can survive the Sword Saint, Huang Shaotian's trash talk?

405
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:07,740
The two teams have assembled.

406
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:10,820
Please shake hands with each other.

407
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:16,360
Young classmate, your senior will tell about you and your father Ye's gap.

408
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:19,460
Pay attention during class later. Did Sister Su miss me?

409
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:23,961
- No. 
 - You've gained weight again.

410
00:33:23,961 --> 00:33:24,980
Shut up.

411
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:29,020
Now the players of the two teams have said hello to each other.

412
00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:32,340
 I don't know if they have created any tension. 

413
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:33,360
 This is incredible. 

414
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:35,460
Admin, where's the beer?

415
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:37,581
- Over there. 
  - Blue Rain has fallen behind with 0-3. 

416
00:33:37,581 --> 00:33:39,440
 It seems after the victory over Tiny Herb, 

417
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:43,640
 with the addition of the rookie champion Sun Xiang, Excellent Era is strong. 

418
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:46,700
And Sun Xiang now uses One Autumn Leaf, the god-level account.

419
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:48,840
His strength will be enhanced.

420
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:50,040
This is a 3v3 series match.

421
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:53,580
Loser exits game based on KOF* rules, another teammate replaces them. 
  (*King of Fighters) 

422
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:55,320
Until there's no one left in the team.

423
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:56,640
The winning team will score 3 points.

424
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:59,900
Is it possible for Sun Xiang to win 3 matches?

425
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:03,180
No. It is very difficult to win 3 consecutive matches.

426
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:06,660
Besides, the opponent is strong.

427
00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:07,980
 Excellent Era will win. 

428
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:10,605
We're finally at the long-awaited 
    

429
00:34:10,605 --> 00:34:13,005
series match.

430
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:17,700
 The match between Excellent Era and Blue Rain will now begin. 

431
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:20,080
 The first round. Sun Xiang, a Battlemage using One Autumn Leaf 

432
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:23,080
 vs. Yu Feng, the Berserker also known as Brilliant Edge. 

433
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:25,940
 Tournament map: Line Canyon. 

434
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:32,160
  ｜  

435
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:34,554
 Let the battle begin! 
  ｜  

436
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:39,360
 One Autumn Leaf attacks first to fight head-on. 

437
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:40,780
 One Autumn Leaf dodged the blow. 

438
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:42,120
 Backhand Dragon Tooth 

439
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:44,760
 Followed by Sky Strike. Brilliant Edge was knocked off. 

440
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:47,801
 He uses Draconic Crusher. One Autumn Leaf's ATK pace is very good. 

441
00:34:55,220 --> 00:34:57,280
Never expected Sun Xiang to storm as soon as he came up.

442
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:59,220
Yu Feng has no strength to fight back.

443
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:01,140
 With Double Stab, One Autumn Leaf launched an onslaught. 

444
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:04,341
 Brilliant Edge is in danger. He is very likely to be killed directly. 

445
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:07,941
   

446
00:35:07,941 --> 00:35:10,160
 Sun Xiang only used 15% of his HP 

447
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:12,120
 to kill Yu Feng, Blue Rain's first player. 

448
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:13,161
 This is a huge advantage. 

449
00:35:13,161 --> 00:35:15,380
 It seems winning 3 matches is possible. 

450
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:20,000
 Blue Rain's second player Receding Tides, a Qi Master is coming. 

451
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,380
 Falling Flower Palm followed by Draconic Crusher. 

452
00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:36,982
 Nice! Sun Xiang only used 10% HP 

453
00:35:36,982 --> 00:35:38,700
 to kill another player from Blue Rain. 

454
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:40,300
 Excellent Era's fans started screaming. 

455
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:43,580
 Can Sun Xiang be the third to win 3 matches? 

456
00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:44,620
 The third round begins. 

457
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:46,960
 Blue Rain's final player is a Spitfire named Bullets Rain, 

458
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:50,420
 which is under the Gunner Profession. Rising Dragon Soars the Sky! 

459
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:55,540
Second kill!

460
00:35:55,540 --> 00:35:58,960
 Sun Xiang's debut with Excellent Era showcased his superior abilities. 

461
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:00,460
 Sun Xiang made it. 

462
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:02,260
 He really won the 3 matches. 

463
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:05,720
 A new Battle God is born. 

464
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:09,540
What kind of shitty luck did he get?

465
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:13,380
If you're capable, win 3 consecutive championships!

466
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:15,460
Boss? Boss? Boss!

467
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:17,220
You're the network admin?

468
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:19,280
Come here.

469
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:21,040
Boss, is this your network admin?

470
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:23,400
He doesn't even know where the beer is.

471
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:26,700
Sorry, sorry.

472
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:30,600
What's wrong with you? You don't even know where the beer is.

473
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:34,471
Draw me a topographic map of this net cafe immediately!

474
00:36:34,471 --> 00:36:37,740
The position of the screws should be accurate to the centimeter. Did you hear me?

475
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:39,220
I...

476
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:45,600
Get the customer his beer.

477
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:49,140
Sorry, the beer is there.

478
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:51,180
Don't do it again next time.

479
00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:52,441
Welcome back. 
    

480
00:36:52,441 --> 00:36:53,780
After the solo matches and series matches,

481
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:56,580
the score is 0-6 with Blue Rain behind.

482
00:36:56,580 --> 00:37:00,500
 If they want to win, they have to get 5 points in the team competition. 

483
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:02,640
 And get 2 extra points for a team ace*. 
 (*Team eliminates the entire opposing team) 

484
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:04,330
What's the big deal?

485
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:11,060
Chu, bring me my account book.

486
00:37:11,060 --> 00:37:14,260
 I've already calculated everything, Boss. 

487
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:16,660
Do it again.

488
00:37:16,660 --> 00:37:18,360
All of them.

489
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:21,170
   

490
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:29,061
Captain, where shall we celebrate tonight?

491
00:37:29,061 --> 00:37:30,740
Eagle's Nest Bar.

492
00:37:30,740 --> 00:37:32,740
All of you cover for me later.

493
00:37:32,740 --> 00:37:35,420
I will kill them all by myself.

494
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:37,620
 - Got it, Captain. 
 - Got it, Captain. 

495
00:37:37,620 --> 00:37:40,900
Captain, let's use the strategy.

496
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:48,760
Relax, Mucheng.

497
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:52,300
After all, we still have the captain.

498
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:54,480
 We all know that Blue Rain has 

499
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:55,961
 one of Glory's four master tacticians, Yu Wenzhou. 

500
00:37:55,961 --> 00:37:58,060
 This is a tactically sophisticated team. 

501
00:37:58,060 --> 00:38:00,080
 The players have great synergy. 

502
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:02,341
 For Excellent Era, can the new captain Sun Xiang 

503
00:38:02,341 --> 00:38:04,840
 lead his team to play with a different style? 

504
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:05,701
 Let's wait and see. 

505
00:38:05,701 --> 00:38:08,160
Remember, be happy!

506
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:10,560
Shaotian. Remember the strategy.

507
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:12,120
Don't worry. Consider it done.

508
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:13,980
When did this Sword Saint ever lose his temper? Right?

509
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:15,860
 - Yes. Fight! 
 - Yes. Fight! 

510
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:18,480
 Players from both sides have entered the competition map. The team competition 

511
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:20,960
 between Team Excellent Era and Team Blue Rain will start right away! 

512
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:22,560
 Of the two strong and competitive teams, 

513
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:24,200
 Sun Xiang, Battlemage: One Autumn Leaf. 

514
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:26,140
 Yu Wenzhou, Warlock: Swoksaar. 

515
00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:28,160
 Su Mucheng, Launcher: Dancing Rain. 

516
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:30,060
 Huang Shaotian, Blade Master: Troubling Rain. 

517
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:34,240
 So what kind of spark will these four star players create? 

518
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:37,320
 Sun Xiang has already showcased his individual superior abilities. 

519
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:40,500
 How will he perform in the team competition? 

520
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:41,980
 One Autumn Leaf's Dragon Breaks the Ranks. 

521
00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:43,500
 His momentum is unstoppable. 

522
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:45,320
 After knocking back the Spitfire Bullets Rain, 

523
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:47,060
 he aims directly at Warlock Swoksaar. 

524
00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:50,481
 Bullets Rain stands up and counters One Autumn Leaf's attack. 

525
00:38:57,380 --> 00:39:00,120
 This Heat-Seeking Missile outplayed two opponents. 

526
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:01,940
 On the other side, the Sword Saint Troubling Rain, 

527
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:03,700
 aims directly at Excellent Era's Sharpshooter. 

528
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:08,080
 Both sides chose to send assaulters to the back to disrupt the opponent. 

529
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,780
 Sun Xiang reacted very fast to counter. 

530
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:17,460
 Yu Wenzhou predicted well and pulled the Qi Master back. 

531
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:20,680
 He escaped from One Autumn Leaf's Draconic Crusher. 

532
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:25,620
 Yes, we see that the HP for both sides is now equal. 

533
00:39:25,620 --> 00:39:27,580
 If this stalemate continues, Blue Rain will lose. 

534
00:39:27,580 --> 00:39:28,700
 The situation is really tense. 

535
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:30,340
 Blue Rain's Qi Master failed to protect the back row. 

536
00:39:30,340 --> 00:39:32,800
 Swoksaar was still restrained by One Autumn Leaf. Nice! 

537
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,020
 Sun Xiang has insane reflexes! 

538
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:36,220
 Escaping the Spitfire's bullet. 

539
00:39:36,220 --> 00:39:37,720
Rats!

540
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:40,260
 One Autumn Leaf hits Swoksaar with Double Stab. 

541
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:42,280
 Sun Xiang continues the momentum of the series match. 

542
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:44,940
 Sun Xiang, awesome! 

543
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:46,460
What "awesome"?

544
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:47,820
Unbox.

545
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:50,680
 Blue Rain needs to adjust their pace now. 

546
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:55,961
 Excellent Era is now pushing to put pressure on Blue Rain. 

547
00:39:55,961 --> 00:39:57,840
Excellent Era is going to lose.

548
00:40:03,020 --> 00:40:04,670
Going to lose?

549
00:40:04,670 --> 00:40:06,950
 We can see Sun Xiang is very brave and strong! 

550
00:40:06,950 --> 00:40:09,060
 It is difficult to play against Blue Rain alone. 

551
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:13,120
Who did you say is going to lose?

552
00:40:13,510 --> 00:40:14,870
 Are we seeing correctly? 

553
00:40:14,870 --> 00:40:17,560
 If Blue Rain is not able to adjust... 

554
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:19,920
You said Excellent Era is going to lose?

555
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:21,920
Are you kidding?

556
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,940
He has taken the limelight now.

557
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:27,160
No. Excellent Era is going to lose.

558
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:30,921
Why?

559
00:40:30,921 --> 00:40:33,440
Yu Wenzhou is using his signature strategy:

560
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:35,400
Box 1 Strategy.

561
