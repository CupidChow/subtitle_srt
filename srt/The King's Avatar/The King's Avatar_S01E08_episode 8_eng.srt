 "Light From the Ashes" - Cai Weize 

2
00:00:02,330 --> 00:00:06,230
♫  Countless fireflies born from insignificance  ♫

3
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:10,060
♫  Riding the long wind to gather into a shining galaxy  ♫

4
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:13,940
♫  Proclaim to the world on top of the sky  ♫

5
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:19,010
♫  We will return in glory  ♫

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,690
♫  Clear the clouds and descend with the heat  ♫

7
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:27,400
♫  Melting ice and snow, overcoming twists and turns  ♫

8
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:31,100
♫  Finally at this moment of peak  ♫

9
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:35,270
♫  There is a figure that coincides with the past  ♫

10
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:39,130
♫  The glory of the past that never came  ♫

11
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:42,700
♫  The pride that the future will never pass  ♫

12
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:46,590
♫  Our fingertips intertwined and condensed  ♫

13
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:50,420
♫  Into a song that ignited that battlefield  ♫

14
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:54,270
♫  The only light in an endless night  ♫

15
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:58,050
♫  Is you and me who overcame mediocrity  ♫

16
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:01,940
♫  Up on the clouds and down in the dust  ♫

17
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:05,740
♫  Fireflies making every effort to illuminate  ♫

18
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:09,670
♫  I came from the legend to carry on a legend  ♫

19
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:13,390
♫  Once it's disruptive, a decade of persistence won't be in vain  ♫

20
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:17,270
♫  Up on the clouds and down in the dust  ♫

21
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:21,110
♫  Fireflies making every effort to illuminate  ♫

22
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:24,740
♫  Fireflies making every effort to illuminate  ♫

23
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:27,840
   

24
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,280
   

25
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,200
By the way, Ying Jie.

26
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:39,200
I heard the restaurant we always go to will be renovated soon.

27
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,760
We may not be able to eat takeout from this shop for a long time.

28
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:46,060
So you have to help me eat more these days.

29
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,400
Why this expression?

30
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,000
I'm just going to train for a few days.

31
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I will come back.

32
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:01,080
Come back soon.

33
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,730
Of course.

34
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:06,320
When I come back, you must defeat that Lord Grim.

35
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:12,800
I heard them say that the captain intends to train you to be his successor.

36
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:17,880
Ying Jie, work hard.

37
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:20,640
You, too. Work hard.

38
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,240
I'm leaving.

39
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:27,900
 Actually, I think it would be good for Yi Fan to go to the Glory bootcamp. 

40
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:29,230
 If he stays on our team, 

41
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:32,480
 he will always be the water boy. That's even worse. 

42
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:44,080
 Subtitles and Timing provided to you by💥🍥 TEAM 7️⃣ 🍥💥 @viki.com 

43
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,480
Okay, thank you.

44
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:11,270
   

45
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:13,080
   

46
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:25,100
   

47
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:17,160
   

48
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,601
 Did you see that guy's gameplay yesterday? 

49
00:04:18,601 --> 00:04:20,340
 - It was hilarious. 
 - Yeah, that's funny. 

50
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:23,060
 - I never knew that there could be such a mistake. 
 - Yeah. 

51
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:31,320
Yi Fan, your performance evaluation.

52
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,000
We know that you've been working very hard.

53
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,400
And you've also made progress.

54
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:41,960
But team competition is intense, and player quota is also limited.

55
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:43,610
If you go back to Tiny Herb with your current performance,

56
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:45,180
you won't get the chance to play in tournaments.

57
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:46,770
We suggest that you continue training here.

58
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:48,280
And go back when you have a chance.

59
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:50,120
Then I'll leave now.

60
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:58,130
   
   

61
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:19,520
 You have a lot of ideas, but you haven't identified your own problems. 

62
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:31,280
 Senior, I'd like to play again. 

63
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,240
 To defeat me? 

64
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:47,260
 No. To lose. 

65
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:50,200
 In order to lose to you again. 

66
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:53,680
 I want to know what my problems are. 

67
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,000
 Why are all my efforts so useless? 

68
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,920
 Meet me at the arena. 

69
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:28,060
 I should have dodged that combo within 10 seconds. 

70
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:29,920
 But I still got hit. 

71
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:33,120
 Senior deliberately exposed three flaws, and I didn't catch them. 

72
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,680
 Hesitation made me miss the best opportunity. 

73
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,990
 Cut Throat is not impactful enough. 

74
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:38,560
 Shining Cut is not fast enough. 

75
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:41,240
 All skills become useless in my hands. 

76
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:43,660
I really have too many problems.

77
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:51,040
Thank you, Senior. Sorry to bother you.

78
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:56,180
 But you have very good situational awareness. 

79
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,600
"Situational awareness"?

80
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:03,260
But it can't help me get one more kill for the team.

81
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:06,220
But it allows you to help your team win.

82
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:09,460
It is a very rare quality.

83
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:16,080
Senior, can I ask for some coaching in person?

84
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,780
 Find me here. 

85
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:27,420
 I hope I can get some insights from Senior to help me map out my esports career. 

86
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:33,840
 Don't think I didn't know. 

87
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,920
 Last time, those players were from Tiny Herb. 

88
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:38,440
 The professional lineup sold you out. 

89
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:40,880
 I never expected that you were still playing Glory. 

90
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:44,200
 Big-Eyed Wang, mind your words. 

91
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,200
 Though I've retired, I can still play Glory. 

92
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,940
 You're idle, anyway. 

93
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:51,320
 Let's 1v1 in the arena. I can pay you with items. 

94
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:56,040
 Don't cry when you lose. 

95
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,200
 There's no need for me to 1v1. 

96
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:59,880
 I've got many players who can scrim with you. 

97
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,960
 Don't play tricks on me. 

98
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:08,180
 Do I look like someone who would be Tiny Herb's scrim partner? 

99
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,360
Still haven't given up?

100
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,100
If you stay in this area for a few more days,

101
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:06,880
those noobs will think you're an NPC.

102
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,160
Tang got pissed off here.

103
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:13,500
She's waiting for that guy to get her revenge.

104
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,620
She did lose badly.

105
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:21,560
But it's not necessarily a bad thing.

106
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:23,376
The world of Glory is so big.

107
00:09:23,376 --> 00:09:26,872
She has to see the gap clearly to know how to catch up.

108
00:09:26,872 --> 00:09:29,040
What do you mean?

109
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:33,040
She met the top-tier players of Glory when she was just starting.

110
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,560
If she can't understand this,

111
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,700
she'll lose her mind if she loses more matches.

112
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:39,700
If you can't say something nice, shut up.

113
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,701
- Do your homework. 
 - You...

114
00:09:43,701 --> 00:09:47,520
It doesn't matter if I lose, I can fight until I win.

115
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:54,000
Tang is foolhardy. Maybe it can become her advantage someday.

116
00:09:57,400 --> 00:10:02,071
Looks like I have to take Big-Eyed Wang's items.

117
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:06,160
 Scrimming with your players is not impossible. 

118
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,680
 But I have one condition. 

119
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:10,360
 I've got a friend here. 

120
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:17,320
 If you want to fight me, you have to defeat her first. 

121
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,880
 No problem. 

122
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:01,680
I bought this cake for Tang. Why are you eating it?

123
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,100
Spit it out.

124
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:06,981
You wronged me, boss. Tang is too busy to eat.

125
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,800
She's still playing?

126
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:16,980
It's almost two hours.

127
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,300
Then why don't you convince her?

128
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:24,860
No.

129
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:28,920
You've got your own mind now, you dare to talk back to your boss.

130
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:32,772
Go. Ask her to come here and eat a piece of cake.

131
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:38,160
Fine. If you don't go,

132
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:41,220
you don't need to be a network admin anymore.

133
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,860
Okay, I'll go.

134
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:48,400
You're the one who wants her to play Glory every day.

135
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,700
You're also the one who doesn't want her to do so.

136
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:51,160
The timing of this transition is really hard to grasp.

137
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:52,860
What are you mumbling about?

138
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,820
What do you want to say?

139
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:06,080
You're playing quite well.

140
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,640
Go rest and drink some water.

141
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:10,540
Time out for a better victory.

142
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,780
You're mocking me.

143
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:21,080
What's good about 10 defeats in 10 games?

144
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,800
You lost ten times?

145
00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:27,940
   

146
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:29,720
In the first match, you fought against a Witch.

147
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:32,240
You fell into three traps successively and were defeated in 19 seconds.

148
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,560
The second match against a Battlemage for only 22 seconds.

149
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,000
You countered once.

150
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,760
Third match, a Ghostblade. You lost in 26 seconds.

151
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:40,240
Because you lack situational awareness.

152
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,880
But you reduced the opponent's HP to half.

153
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:42,980
The fourth match, 33 seconds.

154
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:44,220
The fifth match, 41 seconds.

155
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:47,320
And the 10th match just now, you lasted for 90 seconds.

156
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:49,320
Though you lost, you also made progress.

157
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:51,320
You don't fall for the same trick twice.

158
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:52,700
You can see that, right?

159
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:54,760
My goal is to defeat my opponent.

160
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:57,180
Not to do countdowns with them.

161
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:01,540
Now that's difficult.

162
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:02,640
What do you mean?

163
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:04,840
In the last match, you fought against a Witch.

164
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:07,320
Although you held on for an unprecedented 90 secs,

165
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,400
you fell into his trap three times in a row.

166
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:11,760
At the beginning, he tricked you into using all your ults*. 
  (*Ultimate skills) 

167
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:14,340
You also wasted both the Dragon Tooth and Sky-strike.

168
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:16,440
The opponent was also able to reduce the damage taken by half.

169
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:23,780
Has anyone ever told you furrowed eyebrows can cause arrhythmia?

170
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:26,380
Nonsense.

171
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:29,640
PKs in Glory are more than just using skills.

172
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:32,200
A lot of times, it is significantly influenced by psychological factors.

173
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:35,240
Being aggressive is your advantage.

174
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:41,340
But if you're being led by others, it will become your weakness.

175
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:46,840
There's another battle. You can do it, champ.

176
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:56,400
Tang, you've been playing for more than two hours.

177
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:59,600
Take a break and have a piece of cake.

178
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:17,600
Tang, now I want to... Let me fight him.

179
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,440
I desperately want to play now.

180
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:22,400
Let me play. Come on. Just leave it to me.

181
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:25,060
You should eat some cake.

182
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:09,580
Guo Guo, you've been working so hard recently,

183
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:12,460
I'll allow you to not study for one day, okay?

184
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,660
Study hard and make progress every day.

185
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:19,440
I love studying.

186
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:22,180
Then...

187
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:26,700
I'll buy the weapon you wanted in Congee City last time.

188
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:28,220
Don't want.

189
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:41,420
I'll personally make a cake for you, okay?

190
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:46,400
I don't want to eat.

191
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:49,320
Guo Guo.

192
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:56,920
I'm really angry.

193
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:00,540
And it‘s the kind that you can't make up for.

194
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:02,780
I can't make up for it?

195
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,660
Then I'll give up.

196
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:12,320
Looks like you're not interested in going out together.

197
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,140
That'll do.

198
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:17,600
Finally, there's something you want.

199
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,820
It's a deal, then.

200
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:20,960
Wherever you want to go, whatever you want to eat. I promise

201
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:23,440
that I'll show up whenever you call me.

202
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,460
I'd like some milk tea.

203
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:26,220
No problem. I'll line up to buy for you.

204
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:28,360
- I want to eat cake. 
 - I'll make it for you.

205
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,961
I want to eat hot pot.

206
00:16:29,961 --> 00:16:33,040
We can go to eat whenever we want.

207
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:35,780
Don't be angry, okay?

208
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:37,800
Then you have to accompany me more in the future.

209
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,900
You can't keep doing dungeon quests.

210
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:43,760
Will your words count?

211
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:45,320
Yes.

212
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:53,360
Then I have to think about what to eat first.

213
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:57,020
Thirty-five.

214
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:58,440
Thirty-six.

215
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:00,700
Go left.

216
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:05,580
Are you stupid?

217
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:06,690
I told you to go left, then you should go left.

218
00:17:06,690 --> 00:17:07,640
Why did you go right?

219
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:09,040
Can't you react faster?

220
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:10,660
I'm telling you, it's good that you met me.

221
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:13,920
You would've been extorted if you met someone else. Do you know that?

222
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:16,740
Sorry to trouble you.

223
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:18,603
A mechanical keyboard?

224
00:17:18,603 --> 00:17:20,120
You also play esports?

225
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:22,120
Do you play Glory? Which server and profession?

226
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:23,640
Have you ever broken any dungeon records?

227
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:26,040
Let me tell you, I'm a very skilled Brawler.

228
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:28,160
When you're free, we can do dungeon quests together.

229
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,221
What do you think? By the way, where are you going?

230
00:17:30,221 --> 00:17:32,980
I'm... I'm trying to find a net cafe.

231
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:35,920
Great, let's go. I'll give you a ride.

232
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:41,401
Let me tell you, Master says I have lightning-fast reflexes.

233
00:17:41,401 --> 00:17:42,920
He says I'm clever and insightful.

234
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:45,680
That I'm suitable to be a pro player.

235
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:48,300
From your appearance, I think you're a noob in Glory.

236
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:49,440
But don't be discouraged.

237
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,400
It was the same for me when I first started playing.

238
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:54,021
After a period of time, Master taught me a lot.

239
00:17:54,021 --> 00:17:57,100
Thank you. I'll just get off in front.

240
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:58,220
Who do you think I am?

241
00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:00,040
Am I the kind of person who gives up halfway?

242
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:03,640
I told you I'll take you there. Sit tight.

243
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,880
What's your IGN*? I can add you. 
  (*In-Game Name) 

244
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,720
It's also okay if you add me.

245
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:16,440
Let me tell you, in Glory, I am a very skilled Brawler.

246
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:17,760
My IGN is...

247
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:20,920
Stop! Stop! Stop!

248
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:23,980
Why are you in such a hurry?

249
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:26,160
Is this Happy Internet Cafe?

250
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,540
I am using practical examples to teach you another trick.

251
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:32,000
It's called "too much is as bad as too little".

252
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:37,380
Be careful in the future.

253
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:38,240
Okay.

254
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,400
Let's keep in touch.

255
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,980
We shall meet again someday.

256
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:43,620
Thank you.

257
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:48,980
Hello. Is Lord Grim here?

258
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:51,580
- He's inside. 
 - Thank you.

259
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,060
Lord Grim?

260
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:01,160
Lord Grim.

261
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:02,101
Lord Grim.

262
00:19:02,101 --> 00:19:03,080
Are you Lord Grim?

263
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:06,160
Lord Grim! Lord Grim!

264
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:20,980
You are Lord Grim.

265
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:26,240
It's me.

266
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,560
I'm Steamed Bun Invasion.

267
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:31,220
Boss, this is called predestination.

268
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:34,601
For you, it may just be a small encounter.

269
00:19:34,601 --> 00:19:39,460
But for me, it's a much-anticipated encounter.

270
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:41,900
Hello, Senior. My name is Qiao Yifan.

271
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:43,600
What "Senior"?

272
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,200
This is my boss.

273
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:48,420
God can only be ranked second. Do you get it?

274
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:51,200
Come on. Pay some respect.

275
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:54,320
Hello, senior. My name is Qiao Yifan.

276
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:55,760
I'm the Assassin, Ashen Moon.

277
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,381
- I'd like to— 
 - You want to do dungeon quests with him, right?

278
00:19:57,381 --> 00:19:58,520
No, I want to—

279
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:01,660
- Do you want to see the Myriad Manifestation Umbrella? 
 - No.

280
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:04,020
Senior, last time you told me—

281
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:06,580
What? Last time?

282
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:08,240
It's not your first meeting? When?

283
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,559
Which year, which month, which day, which hour, which minute, which second?

284
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:13,060
Before you knew me or after?

285
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:16,300
Boss, I want the precise time.

286
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:19,780
Do you acknowledge that I'm your first apprentice?

287
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:20,690
Of course.

288
00:20:20,690 --> 00:20:23,000
From now on, I'll give you the task of opening the door every morning.

289
00:20:23,001 --> 00:20:26,381
It means you acknowledge me as your first apprentice.

290
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:30,060
I just acknowledged that your job was to open the door.

291
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:32,300
My first apprentice, Soft Mist,

292
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,280
is there.

293
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:38,900
Soft Mist.

294
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:41,700
No wonder you are so heroic and majestic in Glory.

295
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:46,160
Admirable, fresh and sophisticated, pretty and intelligent.

296
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:48,960
Soft Mist, I knew it.

297
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:51,340
You must be a man.

298
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:55,440
Trying to be attractive using a female persona. Right?

299
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:57,240
Who are you?

300
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:59,020
I'm Steamed Bun.

301
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:00,920
Steamed Bun?

302
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:05,480
Then I'm fermented tofu. Psycho!

303
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,100
Let's talk somewhere else.

304
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:25,300
Senior, you've been here since your retirement?

305
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:28,760
Yes, I work as a network admin here.

306
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:31,020
Why do you work as a network admin?

307
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:38,060
This is the job closest to Glory. It's really nice.

308
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,740
If I can't get back to Tiny Herb this time,

309
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:49,500
I don't think I'll be brave enough to log in to Glory.

310
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:58,320
Then just watch some dramas to relax your mood.

311
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,000
There's a good drama recently.

312
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,640
Have you seen it?

313
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:05,420
It's called "The Full-Time Wife Escapist*". 
  (*2016 JDrama) 

314
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:12,100
Senior, I actually don't have time to watch dramas.

315
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:16,620
Because, even if I train all day,

316
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:19,740
there's still a noticeable gap between me and my teammates.

317
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:22,340
I'm the one who always holds them back.

318
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:29,980
So, until now, I've never participated in an official tournament.

319
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:35,900
But... I still want to play.

320
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:44,960
You sure?

321
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:47,795
I don't want to just give up.

322
00:22:47,795 --> 00:22:50,834
Then change your profession to Phantom Demon.

323
00:22:50,834 --> 00:22:52,140
Phantom Demon?

324
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:56,540
Finding the right direction is much more important than working hard.

325
00:22:56,540 --> 00:22:58,660
But, Senior,

326
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:03,660
I don't even know how to be an Assassin.

327
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:09,060
With my current level, if I practice a profession from scratch, I...

328
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:19,920
   

329
00:25:29,982 --> 00:25:32,826
 Then change your profession to Phantom Demon. 

330
00:25:32,826 --> 00:25:35,940
 And we already have a Phantom Demon in our team. 

331
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:37,540
 We don't need a second one. 

332
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:41,200
 Finding the right direction is much more important than working hard. 

333
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:45,060
 You're there to change your fate, not to give up. 

334
00:25:57,620 --> 00:25:59,200
What's going on with you?

335
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:02,220
You even asked the pro teams to help you do dungeon quests?

336
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:05,460
Can you accept the consequences of losing the tournament?

337
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:12,100
President Tao, I admit that I, Chen Yehui, am selfish at times.

338
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:16,340
But I swear, I never thought of harming Excellent Era.

339
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:34,060
 In such a big place, people don't even make room for the captain anymore. 

340
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:36,700
 It seems that you are really going down. 

341
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:40,980
 Only those in higher places can go down. 

342
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:43,240
 If someone is always at the bottom,  

343
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:45,640
 he is nothing but desperate. 

344
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:50,540
 Since my first day in Excellent Era, you have always looked down on me. 

345
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:18,640
   

346
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:30,080
Who is the boss?

347
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,400
Where is the boss?

348
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:38,040
Where is the boss?

349
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:40,090
   

350
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:49,720
Thank you.

351
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:52,060
Our network admin is getting more and more handsome.

352
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:58,020
Network admin? What are you doing here?

353
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:00,200
To be a network admin?

354
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:01,840
Yeah.

355
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:05,460
How do you feel?

356
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:08,200
Accustomed to being served,

357
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:10,900
can you get used to serving others now?

358
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:13,420
Thank you for thinking about me. I'm used to it.

359
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:17,820
Right. What can you do if you're not used to it?

360
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:20,640
You shouldn't have been so low-key before.

361
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:24,780
Without One Autumn Leaf, no one seems to know you anymore.

362
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:27,460
Yeah, I'm not like you.

363
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:30,700
So high-profile, but still no one knows you.

364
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:34,021
Our captain has already become the network admin of a net cafe.

365
00:28:34,021 --> 00:28:36,480
Why do you still speak so harshly?

366
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,560
But it doesn't matter.

367
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:43,280
Guild leaders, like us, meet many people every day.

368
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:47,940
From bosses to some net cafe's unimportant people, like you.

369
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:50,700
Don't we all have to be polite?

370
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:54,601
Being a guild leader doesn't just rely on dealing with people.

371
00:28:54,601 --> 00:28:56,300
It also relies on strength.

372
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:58,320
When you were a team member,

373
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,760
you spent too much time making friends.

374
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:03,080
But forgot to improve your own strength.

375
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:05,820
That's why you were removed from the team.

376
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:08,080
I didn't expect you to be reassigned to the guild.

377
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:12,940
But you're still using these unacceptable practices.

378
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:21,640
How can you say that about me?

379
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:25,300
What have you done after you joined the guild?

380
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:26,860
How many dungeon records did you set?

381
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:28,960
What's the increase in membership?

382
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,420
If you're not good at management,

383
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:34,540
it would be useless even if the whole team is there for you.

384
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:37,660
How do you know that?

385
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:42,340
If you don't regard Glory as something you love,

386
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:45,960
I suggest that you leave as soon as possible.

387
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:52,020
Who do you think you are?

388
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:54,640
You are just a wretched network admin.

389
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:57,200
You don't get to teach me.

390
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:08,740
Give me a workstation.

391
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:12,000
Network Admin Ye.

392
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,940
   
   

393
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:18,220
I'm sorry.

394
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:20,150
The way to treat customers according to my boss

395
00:30:20,150 --> 00:30:21,880
might not be suitable for drunkards.

396
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:25,020
Please come back when you're sober.

397
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:42,940
Okay. Then, I'll see you soon.

398
00:30:46,060 --> 00:30:48,400
Looking forward to your next visit.

399
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:52,660
Okay, I'm almost there.

400
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:58,060
It's okay.

401
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:04,180
   

402
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:24,710
   

403
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:44,880
Our teammates who are trying to level up in Line Canyon have almost been wiped out.

404
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:47,080
Can you do dungeon quests properly?

405
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:49,460
Just for those damn items?

406
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:52,660
Is there still some quality? Can we still keep some order?

407
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:55,420
Does Lord Grim only want a few items?

408
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:58,620
In order to accumulate in-game items, several major guilds

409
00:31:58,620 --> 00:32:00,440
invited Lord Grim to dungeon quests.

410
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:03,320
They almost sent out elite teams. They'd even KS* bosses. 
  (*Kill Steal) 

411
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:05,000
It's not just the Line Canyon.

412
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:08,140
You can go look at any dungeons, and the situations are all the same.

413
00:32:08,140 --> 00:32:09,740
It's basically a Shura Battlefield*. 
  (*Realm of demons and demigods with endless carnage.) 

414
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:11,820
This world is in a mess.

415
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:13,820
Xi Zhou, you...

416
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:22,201
Look at it yourself.

417
00:32:22,201 --> 00:32:25,400
Dungeon records with that master gave us a lot of help.

418
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:27,521
We can obviously see the growth of our membership.

419
00:32:27,521 --> 00:32:29,040
But don't forget,

420
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:32,000
the amount of tasks assigned by the top team also increased.

421
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,500
Look at the string of defeats we experience daily.

422
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:37,440
It can result in a bad performance this month.

423
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:41,220
We owe our victories and defeats to Lord Grim.

424
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:43,840
Don't tell me those stupid words.

425
00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:51,140
Any feedback from those undercover guys we assigned to other guilds?

426
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:53,860
They're having a hard time, too.

427
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:56,180
They're all scratching their heads to find a way.

428
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:24,300
Master, where are we going?

429
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:29,200
Shopping.

430
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:34,460
Shopping?

431
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:38,000
Shopping.

432
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:50,920
This is Congee City.

433
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:53,320
It is one of the major cities in the land of Glory.

434
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:55,360
Here, all the players can trade items

435
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:56,520
and buy supplies.

436
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:58,860
Most importantly, after your character is killed,

437
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:00,390
you can choose to respawn in the city

438
00:34:00,390 --> 00:34:02,940
and continue fighting afterwards.

439
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:05,860
There is a barrier at the city gate acting as a huge protective shield.

440
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:09,300
Fighting is prohibited in the city, but it is allowed outside.

441
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:12,960
From now on, Congee City will be our base.

442
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,380
After such a long time of doing dungeon quests, we can finally enter the city.

443
00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:22,800
Boss, look at this Bloodsucking Claw I picked. Isn't it gorgeous?

444
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:25,734
This 800-Gold Coin Orange Weapon really feels different.

445
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:29,140
Of course, you've spent all the gold coins.

446
00:34:29,140 --> 00:34:30,580
Thank you, Boss.

447
00:34:30,580 --> 00:34:32,640
I bought you something, and now you're calling me boss?

448
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:34,740
You're too obvious.

449
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:38,440
Boss, you should also buy a weapon for Tang Rou.

450
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:40,820
She won't be able to defeat me without an Orange Weapon.

451
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:44,740
Weapons are not that important to me.

452
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:58,161
- Evaluation is about to begin. 
 - I'm exhausted.

453
00:34:58,161 --> 00:34:59,300
Let's go.

454
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:00,240
Let's go.

455
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:02,921
- Good luck. 
 - You, too.

456
00:35:02,921 --> 00:35:06,020
Yi Fan, the bootcamp's evaluation is about to begin.

457
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:08,381
- Let's go now. 
 - Okay.

458
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:36,760
Sister Tang Rou, why are you walking so fast?

459
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:39,240
Let me show you my new weapon.

460
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:48,940
Watch out. There's an ambush.

461
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:36,481
Just in time for me to test my new weapon.

462
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:44,510
   

463
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:47,361
Team two Launchers. Get ready for the Heat-Seeking Missiles.

464
00:36:47,361 --> 00:36:49,370
Team two, copy. Team two, copy.

465
00:36:49,370 --> 00:36:51,340
   

466
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:55,241
Team one Elementalist. Get ready for the Flame Explosion.

467
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:13,577
Your new equipment affects your AS and MS*. 
  (*Attack Speed, Movement Speed) 

468
00:37:13,577 --> 00:37:14,740
Make sure to adjust to it.

469
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:16,600
Copy that!

470
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:34,080
Your AS is faster, so make sure to adjust your timing.

471
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:35,840
After switching to an Orange weapon,

472
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:37,440
I feel like I'm running so fast.

473
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:40,080
Like there's a rocket under my feet.

474
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:47,220
Boss, after my character runs out of HP, my weapons will drop. Right?

475
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:48,960
I have to protect such good weapons.

476
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:51,420
I can't allow them to be taken by others.

477
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:05,520
Get back to Congee City first.

478
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:26,080
Another one looking for trouble.

479
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:28,340
One Inch Ash? Phantom Demon?

480
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:29,600
Who is he?

481
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:32,300
Is he here to help us or kill us?

482
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:33,401
Steamed Bun Invasion, attack.

483
00:38:33,401 --> 00:38:35,380
You and Tang should move at a 60-degree angle.

484
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:38,220
Make sure to stagger your ults with a 30-second gap.

485
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:44,500
Yi Fan, check our timing and pacing and determine the best formation and positioning.

486
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:46,380
Got it, Senior.

487
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:51,500
Are you that little brother I brought with me?

488
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:53,080
You're not bad.

489
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:54,320
The pacing is consistent.

490
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:55,780
Keep on fighting.

491
00:38:55,780 --> 00:38:58,380
Don't waste your time initiating fights. Manage your cooldowns.

492
00:38:58,380 --> 00:38:59,620
Make sure you've reached the maximum efficiency.

493
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:00,720
Yes, Senior.

494
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:02,720
Make sure to support Soft Mist.

495
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:09,960
- Missed it. 
 - Watch out!

496
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:18,000
Don't panic, stabilize your APM*. 
 (*Actions Per Minute)

497
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,820
Forget Ice Boundary and use Ghost Boundary first.

498
00:39:19,820 --> 00:39:21,500
Then Moonlight Slash, keep attacking.

499
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:22,760
Don't panic if you make mistakes.

500
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:24,040
The more urgent the situation is,

501
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:26,000
the more you can exercise your mindset and judgment.

502
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,040
Got it, Senior.

503
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:29,000
Use the Sword Formation Blessing.

504
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:40,480
Ghost Boundary?

505
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:42,440
Wait for the perfect timing, the same coordinates.

506
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:45,121
- Stack on Ghost Boundary. 
 - Got it, Senior.

507
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:51,760
Dual Linking Ghost Boundaries?

508
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:54,420
A Phantom Demon that was just registered a few days ago,

509
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:56,980
knows how to utilize Dual Linking Ghost Boundaries?

510
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:10,320
   

511
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:12,720
Guild Leader, Team Three has completed their quests.

512
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:13,900
Do you need backup?

513
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:18,680
No. This is just the appetizer. I just want to see what they can do.

514
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:28,860
It worked.

515
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:31,660
Brother Yi Fan, your Ghost Boundary is insane!

516
00:40:31,660 --> 00:40:35,180
When can we 1v1?

517
00:40:36,010 --> 00:40:45,890
