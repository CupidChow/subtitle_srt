26
00:01:46,393 --> 00:01:49,053
Why am I always be the last one?

27
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:59,460
I can't be a burden of Xing Xin.

28
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:02,820
I'll get back to Glory and practice hard.

29
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:07,920
Although he's at the bottom of this list,

30
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,380
he's at the top of another list.

31
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,520
Scrap Picker reward list.

32
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:20,880
No more than three words a week,

33
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:24,240
I can't see through what's going on in his mind.

34
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:26,420
Let's see him in the game.

35
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,320
I am the top Scrap Picker of Glory.

36
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,540
This kid's lucky.

37
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:47,500
Got an orange suit at the beginning. So lucky.

38
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:48,960
 

39
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,380
I can't be the last one.

40
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,380
What? He doesn't pick the equipment after kill someone?

41
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:57,340
Isn't he here to scrap-pick?

42
00:02:57,340 --> 00:03:00,240
He'll lose badly sooner or later if he still plays like that.

43
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:03,720
He might be training in this way.

44
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:07,740
But unfortunately, it's a wrong way.

45
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:19,020
Kill people steadily and severely.

46
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:22,240
My DPS can't be the last.

47
00:03:31,489 --> 00:03:37,454
 

48
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:45,600
What's the problem?

49
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,670
There's the ninja that killed our brother.

50
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,460
Don't even think about running away.

51
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:23,900
I'll let you know how good I am.

52
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:40,680
Are they here to help me?

53
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:43,860
Don't get us wrong. You guys go on.

54
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:47,140
We are here to look around. We won't disturb you.

55
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:49,800
They're just here to pick up the equipment.

56
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,048
I'm going to rush out by myself.

57
00:04:53,048 --> 00:04:56,235
Prove to you guys that I can do it.

58
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:04,060
The Mechanic, you hit so soft, you can kill him if you hit hard.

59
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:07,160
All of you think I'm not strong enough.

60
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:10,460
Attack him in the rear.

61
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:13,540
He's good at quiting the game
when he has lost the upper hand.

62
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:16,200
This time, I won't run away.

63
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:18,740
I'll go straight to the end.

64
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:52,160
Who fired just now?

65
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:59,900
It's okay that you lose,
you can level up by yourself.

66
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:02,240
But your equipment is our team's property,

67
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,640
it's a great loss if they are taken away.

68
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:06,080
They're with him.

69
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,540
Don't let anyone go. Go get them.

70
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:38,420
We are all in this trouble because of you.

71
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:40,320
You have to take the full responsibility.

72
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:43,080
You go and protect An.

73
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:45,240
I'll leave the most value equipments of our team
to you.

74
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:47,600
We don't need to play the
Challenge if you lose them.

75
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,780
Copy that.

76
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:51,980
I'll take the responsibility
of the trouble I made all by myself.

77
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:03,140
I'll chase back the Frigid Defender.

78
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,180
I did it. I avoid it.

79
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:40,740
I didn't duplicate my last mistake.

80
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,820
Bao Zi, pay attention to your position.

81
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:55,200
You are in the way of Lao Wei's attack.

82
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,840
Boss, is my cooperation right?

83
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,040
What... What should I do?

84
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,200
Position.

85
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,380
Move three to five positions
in the direction of three o'clock.

86
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:05,160
Consider your teammates' position.

87
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,960
Find a position that can assure your damage and doesn't effect your teammates.

88
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:10,960
That's the position you belong in the team.

89
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,620
I have my own position.

90
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:35,780
He's pretty clever.

91
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:39,740
Because he belongs to my team.

92
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:42,580
Let's see the results.

93
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:10,100
Hello.

94
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:14,480
You've taken the equipment. Don't be too greedy.

95
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:17,120
You are...

96
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:23,380
Right.

97
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:28,140
I'm the one that killed your character during the game

98
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:30,320
you against Jia Shi last time.

99
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,920
So you...

100
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:44,380
I'm Feng Shu Yan Mu, the one who was chasing you.

101
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:53,540
Everyone's acting good.

102
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:58,540
Of course. You've paid all the intentions to train the new guy.

103
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:02,620
Master, call us if there's another group performance like this.

104
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:05,960
Act better, talk less, and we
brought our own equipment.

105
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:10,740
Boss, do I deserve an Oscar for my acting just now?

106
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:13,280
I deserve it.

107
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,980
Look at me, skillful and idolized.

108
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:18,620
You are just shameless.

109
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:20,000
What did you say?

110
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,080
Shame on you.

111
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:23,260
Everyone's been stuck in
the room for training lately.

112
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:27,100
You've been working hard and need to relax.

113
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:29,320
How about one-on-one?

114
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,640
One-on-one? Basketball?

115
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:36,780
We should give Xing Xian's new teammate a welcome gift.

116
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,920
Is today's gift not enough?

117
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:43,480
Of course not.

118
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:46,060
But that basketball gym is hard to book,

119
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:47,060
It's hard to be solved, right?

120
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:48,360
Cure it.

121
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:51,461
- Try to book it a week in advance. 
  - Fine, I'll try.

122
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:54,780
There's an important position spot here. Pay attention to this.

123
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:58,780
It can magnify HP and clear buff after each cycle.

124
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:01,060
I'll give you the coordinate.

125
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:04,600
218 52 521, the first one.

126
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:07,040
081 603, the second one.

127
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,260
192 735, the third one.

128
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:13,500
We'd better stay in these three coordinates at the same time.

129
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:16,861
In this way, it can improve the speed of movement,

130
00:11:16,861 --> 00:11:21,700
and can also lengthening the speed at around 2 seconds.

131
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:25,740
Moreover, there's an effect of refreshing skills.

132
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:27,540
I've mark the coordinates of its positions.

133
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:30,380
They're EBACD.

134
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:34,101
It can cause 300% of its own damage.

135
00:11:34,101 --> 00:11:36,000
It can lasts for 3 seconds.

136
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,660
See? Here.

137
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:40,540
This point here.

138
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:44,960
Right. Now its DPS is 1000, move speed is 500, a little slow.

139
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:47,161
Is the DPS a little weak?

140
00:11:47,161 --> 00:11:50,500
The lenthening HP will be improved after a circle.

141
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,160
This point. Look.

142
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,820
Stop wandering around. I'm dizzy.

143
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:57,560
Come and sit here with us.

144
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,620
2 o'clock.

145
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:07,480
I made an appointment to the basketball gym.

146
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:11,240
You bastard.

147
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:13,160
Why don't you say it till now?

148
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,440
What time is it now?

149
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,160
Almost 2 o'clock. Let's go.

150
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,200
Go. Go. Go.

151
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,700
Come on.

152
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:22,700
Considering from the height, bouncing ability, and other comprehensive qualities,

153
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:27,600
I think the winning rate is higher if we are in captain's team.

154
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:35,680
That's not how it works.

155
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:41,860
Well, I'll introduce you the rules.

156
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:44,141
- First... 
 - We're just playing casually.

157
00:12:44,141 --> 00:12:45,280
We don't need any rules.

158
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:47,500
Right. Fine.

159
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:49,840
Then let's play.

160
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,780
Come on.

161
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:56,340
Shooting is so easy.

162
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:57,700
Just as same as throwing bricks.

163
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:59,920
Let me show you.

164
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:11,260
Watch out, Tang Rou.

165
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:20,340
That's a nice shot...

166
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:28,140
What are you doing?

167
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:33,520
I think there's no problem winning him by 50:0.

168
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:37,260
That's not how it works.

169
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:40,460
Just playing casually. We don't need any rules.

170
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:43,220
I'm on your side.

171
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:50,280
What's going on with the slippers?

172
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,500
They feel good.

173
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:53,160
Let's begin.

174
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:04,620
Here. Faster.

175
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:05,960
Slower.

176
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:08,300
Give me, give me, pass it to me.

177
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:45,280
I thought we're playing one-on-one,

178
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:47,700
why turn into a team competition?

179
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:51,560
Only this way can train their cooperations,

180
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:56,260
and only this way can bring the team together into a fighting team.

181
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:59,460
As a team's manager, I have the obligation to
motivate and guide teammates,

182
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:01,200
and guide them to establish
an effective communication,

183
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,120
help them to improve their abilities.

184
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:07,340
Boss, you're so professional now.

185
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:09,260
Thanks.

192
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:47,160
Relax, take your time.

193
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:49,060
Bao Zi, you go up.

194
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:52,340
Mo Fan finally shout out a voice of inspiration.

195
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:54,180
He can say it on his own initiative,

196
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:58,920
it means that cooperation has already slipped into his consciousness.

197
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:02,060
We are not wasting our time.

198

205
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:33,380
A basketball game help me realize the meaning of "team",

206
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:36,000
We need to be ourselves yet protecting each other,

207
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,200
we need to be independent yet rely on each other.

208
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,880
That's the meaning of us being together.

209
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:49,460
Of course I also let them know that proper exercise is benefit to our health.

210
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:53,100
But as a eSports player, we need to learn to protect ourselves,

211
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:55,240
no rushing and no hurting.

212
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:58,100
So... Friendship first, competition second.

213
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:00,600
I'll let them win.

214
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:01,880
I'm here.

215
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:03,920
Guo Guo, let's go.

216
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:07,600
 ♫ We are the brightest fireflies ♫ 

217

 ♫ We are the brightest fireflies ♫ 

218
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:14,840
Today Thunderbolt Team lost again,

219
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:16,680
thus finished all the games in this season.

220
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:19,500
Ranking in 18th on the league table.

221
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:27,600
What's the feeling of leaving your old team?

222
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:33,940
Thunderbolt is not only my old team.

223
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:37,420
I come from Thunderbolt,

224
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,240
That's my starting point.

225
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:44,300
But it's not your finishing point.

226
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:51,580
What do you think is my finishing point?

227
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:56,060
Win the championship trophy.

228
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:00,380
But everyone says that

229
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:05,980
transfer from league team to demoted Jia Shi is not wise.

230
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:10,840
But you know that

231
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:16,040
Jia Shi is still the most ambitious and powerful of Glory to win the championship.

232
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:22,420
That team and equipment deserve your finishing point.

233
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:31,380
You know Jia Shi better than you know me.

234
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:33,080
The 9th National Challenge of Glory

235
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:35,760
has announced the grouping of top twenty teams.

236
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:38,480
Scores will be ranked in both team A and B this time.

237
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:41,100
Winners of both team will play in the final.

238
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:45,210
Since the founding of league, Jia Shi, which has been demoted, is assigned to team A.

239
00:18:45,210 --> 00:18:49,500
Because of the existence of Jia Shi, team A will be a team of accompany this year.

240
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,040
Xing Xin's lucky.

241
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:52,720
You are not in the same team with Jia Shi.

242
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:55,160
We won't meet before the final.

243
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:59,420
Then... See you at the final.

244
00:19:05,241 --> 00:19:09,120
From now on, I'll abandon the identity
of Thunderbolt's captain,

245
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:13,520
and win the championship with a new identity.

246
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,000
You, too.

247
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:21,200
Wait for me.

248
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:38,740
You want to give me gifts, just go to the Net Cafe.

249
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:40,680
Why here?

250
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,640
This is not a normal place.

251
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,960
This is an old place that you took me here

252
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:48,380
to see pentode stairs and found Easter Eggs.

253
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:53,320
It seems like you have an Easter Egg for me today.

254
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:05,120
This gift... can't be counted as creative.

255
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,480
You buy me this every year,

256
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:10,840
I think it isn't qualified of Easter Eggs.

257
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:12,760
I've counted it.

258
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:17,300
There will be ten games from now to the final.

259
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:19,080
Newcomer needs a new appearance.

260
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:22,260
I've prepared for you. Ten masks.

261
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:29,820
You can choose... not to wear it.

262
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:38,200
This is the place you told me that

263
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:42,180
my brother's map bug has a surprisingly Easter Egg.

264
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:47,440
Some bugs will always exist if we don't fix it.

265
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:50,080
But if you are willing to have a try,

266
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:54,220
maybe there'll be a different Easter Egg reversal.

267
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:12,700
Easter Egg!

268
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:22,760
Leave us alone.

269
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:25,920
Nice. Give him another punch.

270
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,560
Did you see, grandpa? I take him down.

271
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:29,840
Stop playing. Let's go home first.

272
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,240
Let's play again.

273
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:35,120
Okay. Grandpa, I'm sure I'll win again.

274
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:45,460
Grandpa, I hope you can see the present me.

275
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:11,000

00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:40,140
I allowed him to go.

321
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:43,881
Dad. I know you're happy about him playing computer games with you.

322
00:25:43,881 --> 00:25:47,341
But you can't connive his bad behavior like this.

00:25:47,341 --> 00:25:48,960
Bad behavior?

00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:21,960
Seems like my Guang has gone out successfully.

330
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:31,380
 ♫ You cover your unwillingness with a smile ♫ 

331
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:37,440
Master, master.

332
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:40,280
Guang's calling. Over.

333
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:42,080
Master copy.

334
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:45,980
The great devil isn't home, the communication is safe.

335
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:50,601
Grandpa, I won the first prize in the game, and met lots of expert there.

336
00:26:50,601 --> 00:26:54,120
Besides, I've met a friend that is thoughtful.

337
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:57,020
We decided to do something big.

338
00:26:57,020 --> 00:27:01,300
Remember to look after yourself when you're away from home.

339
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:05,760
Have you found somewhere to live?

340
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,020
Grandpa, great news.

341
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:10,840
I and my friends are going to hold the first Glory Professional Alliance.

342
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:13,800
Do you know what is Alliance, grandpa?

343
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:19,700
It means that we can literally make games into a sport.

344
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:23,040
Guang is so great.

345
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:28,470
Grandpa is waiting to see you in the arena.

346
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:34,160
Right, have you found somewhere to live?

347
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:38,660
Grandpa, I have to attend a very important examination in a few days.

348
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:43,041
If I pass, I can be a real professional eSports player.

349
00:27:43,041 --> 00:27:45,760
I'm so happy for you.

350
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:52,960
Guang, I can't find the CD-ROM.

351
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:58,940
I'll ask the great devil if he hides it.

352
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:03,900
And have you found somewhere to live?

353
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:11,840
 ♫ And my warmth forever ♫ 

354
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:19,460
 ♫ Let us stay together ♫ 

355
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:31,340
Can I help you?

356
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:35,640
Is CD-ROM provided here?

357
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:37,180
You seem like an old customer.

358
00:28:37,180 --> 00:28:39,200
We did sell CD-ROM here.

359
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:41,680
But we don't sell anymore three years ago.

360
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:44,220
Young people are playing Glory nowadays.

361
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:46,140
So we updated our product as well.

362
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:48,360
But we still retain the signboard.

363
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:55,100
Only this shop still exists after so many years.

364
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:58,720
I would have thought I went wrong if not see this signboard.

365
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:02,480
One just recognize the way by these familiar things.

366
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:05,700
Did you come back home from out in the field?

367
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:19,320
Back home.

368
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:21,400
Grandpa's funeral affairs have been taken care of.

369
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:23,940
You take a good rest these two days.

370
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:30,040
I believe that whether grandpa or me

371
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:35,380
wish to see you can get back on track.

372
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:39,040
I've prepared the passport and luggage for you.

373
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:41,420
This is the information about that school.

374
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:45,400
Tell me if you need anything else.

375
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:49,300
Dad, I don't want to go abroad.

376
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:51,780
Why?

377
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:55,040
Because I have a very good friend waiting for me.

378
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:57,600
We agreed to become professional players together.

379
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,340
Professional players?

380
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:01,880
You want to be a professional
player by playing computer?

381
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:04,640
Haven't you recognize reality?

382
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,720
I thought your grandfather's death would

383
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:09,140
make you understand what's most important.

384
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,320
I'm not asking you to be
successful and glorify your ancestors.

385
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:16,481
But I don't want you to choose a career that is doomed to failure.

386
00:30:16,481 --> 00:30:19,620
I don't want your life to be filled with regrets.

387
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:22,700
I don't want you to regret one day, but there's no way back.

388
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:26,800
Dad, I don't know if I'll regret it in the future.

389
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:32,160
But now I want to try my best.

390
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:34,760
You are humiliating Ye family.

391
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:39,380
Stay as my son or never come back.

392
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:40,940
Dad.

393
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:51,280
From now on,
you have nothing to do with this family.

394
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:18,300
 ♫ You are as always ♫ 

395
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:25,290
 ♫ Keep calm even though I have to leave ♫

00:31:26,140 --> 00:31:31,000

 ♫ Let me have a short break ♫ 

399
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:44,220
 ♫ The snow is heavy ♫

407
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:32,320
 ♫ I am an ordinary, but more than ordinary ♫ 

408
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:35,480
 ♫ I am at the summit, looking for another summit ♫ 

409

 ♫ We will meet again when the day comes ♫ 

410

 ♫ We stand at the starry summit ♫ 

413

 ♫ Now I finally understand what I used to be ♫ 

414
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:54,260
 ♫ I have always been my own hero ♫

 ♫ I have seen the legend before ♫ 

416
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:12,020
 ♫ I have seen the legend before ♫ 

417
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:25,360
Dad,

418
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:31,420
I was sitting here the day I left home,

419
00:34:31,420 --> 00:34:33,160
you told me that

420
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:36,180
you don't want me to have no way back
while I regret.

421
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:41,300
Dad, I always want to tell you these years

422
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:45,920
that I don't need the way back at all.

423
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:50,160
Cause I never regret.

424
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:52,700
Noodles don't taste good after a long time.

425
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:00,000
I built a new team.

426
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,680
We're going to play
the first National Challenge soon.

427
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:04,420
I hope

428
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:08,280
you can come and see my game.
