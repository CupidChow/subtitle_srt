Our two players have been on the stage now.

25
00:01:35,686 --> 00:01:39,630
Please get into the competition room
for preparation.

27
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,120
Good. Yi Cun Hui has detoured
to the rear of Anxious Ghost.

28
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:59,684
His move and choice look more like an Assassin
rather than a Ghostblade.

29
00:02:00,504 --> 00:02:02,424
Now if Yi Cun Hui sang the Ghost Array,

30
00:02:02,424 --> 00:02:05,444
Anxious Ghost would be thrown into passivity.

31
00:02:05,444 --> 00:02:07,880
The Ghostblade of Team Zhu Xian hasn't found
that his rival has already been in his rear.

32
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,908
It's a bit reckless.
Yi Cun Hui is going to attack.

33
00:02:09,908 --> 00:02:13,288
It seems that he's not going
to sing the Ghost Array.

34
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,500
Move! Yi Cun Hui gave up the chance
of singing the Ghost Array.

35
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:25,908
He made a melee attack
using Ghost Array and Ghost-Chop.

36
00:02:25,908 --> 00:02:28,788
But it appears that flaw was exposed
to Yi Cun Hui on purpose by Anxious Ghost.

37
00:02:28,788 --> 00:02:30,028
What a pity!

38
00:02:30,028 --> 00:02:32,788
He lost some HP.

39
00:02:36,233 --> 00:02:37,800
Yi Cun Hui is very familiar with this arena.

40
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,840
He escaped successfully.

41
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,480
Anxious Ghost lost his goal.

42
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:43,040
Yes. Anxious Ghost is very cautious now.

43
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,240
He is moving slowly.

44
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:47,500
He is searching for Yi Cun Hui's location.

45
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:05,280
Look, right now Yi Cun Hui is still hiding
on the top of the wall.

46
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,320
It appears
that he's still observing the surroundings.

47
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:09,360
It isn't a long distance
between Anxious Ghost and Yi Cun Hui.

48
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,920
And the former is moving toward the latter.

49
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:13,400
That's a good chance!

50
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,240
But I don't understand what is he waiting for?

51
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,810
Anxious Ghost is quite near him.

52
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:27,520
He can make a sneak attack at any time.

53
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,400
Oh, no!
Yi Cun Hui's location is exposed by his shadow.

54
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,360
Anxious Ghost has discovered!

55
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:33,720
What? Anxious Ghost didn't dodge.

56
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:36,200
He got hit! What happened?

57
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,561
Anxious Ghost is too passive.
He got repelled again.

58
00:03:42,561 --> 00:03:45,180
Yi Cun Hui is catching up with him.

59
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:47,680
It's Wen Array. Anxious Ghost has nowhere to run.

60
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,160
Qiao Yi Fan knows the map much better
than his opponent.

61
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:52,737
We can see
that Yi Cun Hui is still singing the ghost array

62
00:03:52,737 --> 00:03:56,200
The location and timing that he chose are perfect.

63
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,440
One more Dark Array.
He blocked his opponent's line of sight.

64
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:07,200
Qiao Yi Fan's vision of overall situation
is great.

65
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,200
Seal off the perimeter by using the Ghost Array.

66
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,880
It's like the encyclopedia
of Ghost Array right now.

67
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:13,640
It's going to be game over.

68
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:17,720
The Feast of Ghosts.
All of the Ghost Arrays exploded at the same time.

69
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,400
Anxious Ghost is going to be hurt to dead.

70
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:20,920
Nice!

71
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,520
Okay. Congratulations on Qiao Yi Fan's victory.

72
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:30,640
For winning the first victory of Individual Event.

73
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:31,940
It's so amazing.

74
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:35,440
Qiao Yi Fan showed his strong dominance
to this game.

75
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:39,920
He is familiar with every location,
every angle and each detail of this map.

76
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,240
Even to an alarming degree.

77
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,940
Well done.

78
00:04:43,899 --> 00:04:47,139
Okay. Let's watch the playback on the screen.

79
00:04:48,533 --> 00:04:51,083
It was the lightning. He has used the lightning.

80
00:04:51,083 --> 00:04:54,660
He has used
the irradiating position of the lightning when he started the second attack.

81
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:56,818
He hid his attack in it.

82
00:04:56,818 --> 00:04:59,557
It caught Anxious Ghost off guard. And got hit directly.

83
00:04:59,557 --> 00:05:01,740
Ruo Feng, I have a bold idea.

84
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:03,960
Yi Cun Hui just failed in a sneak attack.

85
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:05,720
Was it really a stupid mistake?

86
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,937
After he failed, he ran
quickly down to the footpath.

87
00:05:07,937 --> 00:05:10,096
Anxious Ghost was disturbed by the lightning
in the next moment.

88
00:05:10,096 --> 00:05:12,460
Was these all a coincidence?

89
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:14,820
It means that it's a part of the plan.

90
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:16,306
Yes.

91
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,360
What kind of trick did you play?

92
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,040
We are all Ghostblade.

93
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:23,700
Haven't you noticed that?

94
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:27,400
We remember
Qiao Yi Fan has been mediocre since his debut.

95
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:30,818
From the first time be defeated by Xuan Qi Knight to nosed out the Everlasting.

96
00:05:30,818 --> 00:05:32,640
And finally gave us
such a wonderful performance today.

97
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:35,387
He has became a mature professional
from a nameless person.

98
00:05:35,387 --> 00:05:37,743
He is able to stand on his own two feet now.

99
00:05:37,743 --> 00:05:41,140
And he can bring endless hope to the team.

100
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:42,520
A perfect victory.

101
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:45,520
Xing Xin Team took the first point.

102
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,361
It's fine.

103
00:05:46,361 --> 00:05:48,480
- It doesn't matter.
- You will make it next time.

104
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:50,880
Good!

105
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,890
You has shown your power to Zhu Xian Team.

106
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:56,225
See? We will win even though Ye Xiu is not here.

107
00:05:56,225 --> 00:05:59,080
We have to win even though captain is not here.

108
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:01,724
Next, it's my showtime. I will win.

109
00:06:01,724 --> 00:06:02,780
Congratulations on Xing Xin Team.

110
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:05,466
They took the first point of Individual Event.

111
00:06:05,466 --> 00:06:08,406
In the following, they decided to appoint Bao Rongxing.

112
00:06:08,406 --> 00:06:09,760
And how about Zhu Xian Team?

113
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:12,800
It's Zhang Jian.
They will be rivals in this round.

114
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:13,800
The second round of Individual Event.

115
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:16,240
Bao Rongxing from Xing Xin
vs Zhang Jian from Zhu Xian.

116
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,513
Bao Zi, the Invader.

117
00:06:17,513 --> 00:06:19,460
Zhang Jian, the Invisible Green Hornet.

118
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:20,660
It's him.

119
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:23,560
Bao Zi. He has gone.

120
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:26,480
So fast. We're in trouble.

121
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,551
What's wrong?

122
00:06:28,551 --> 00:06:31,220
Zhang Jian is not a famous player.

123
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:33,740
They are all ready.

124
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:37,153
Please get our two players
into the competition room.

125
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:44,000
His opponent is a veteran in
Zhu Xian Team, Zhang Jian.

126
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,575
We don't know that if Bao
Rongxing gets fully preparation.

127
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:51,400
They have entered the map. The game is on.

128
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,560
We can see that they meet
each other in the beginning.

129
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,360
But Bao Zi is not going to fight face to face.

130
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,460
He chooses to run away.

131
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:58,432
Although Zhang Jian is not a first-class player,

132
00:06:58,432 --> 00:07:00,940
but he is a seven years old professional player.

133
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:04,310
He is quite experienced. His techniques are very steady.

134
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,580
Bao Zi... Maybe he can scare away the ordinarily players.

135
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:10,920
But not him.

136
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,260
Zhang Jian is a seasoned player.

137
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:18,040
They are getting closer. Phoenix Cut.

138
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:20,640
Bao Zi, the Invader is downed. He is cornered.

139
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:23,180
He has nowhere to run. But only to fight back.

140
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:24,600
Bao Zi is so passive now.

141
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,760
He may die if he goes on like this.

142
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:27,800
The Intimidation Skill.

143
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:30,760
It only can weaken your opponent's
attack and the attack speed.

144
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:32,712
It doesn't have any real defense efficacy.

145
00:07:32,712 --> 00:07:35,400
It's so puzzling.

146
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:38,200
It seems like Bao Zi is going to fight back.

147
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:40,760
It works.

148
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:50,680
How can it be? Ranger has no sword.

149
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:57,320
What's is going on? The situation is reversing suddenly.

150
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:59,160
Bao Zi catches the rhythm successfully.

151
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,980
His opponent is dead now.

152
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,380
An Eye For An Eye.

153
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:03,618
Bao Zi has remembered his opponent's tricks.

154
00:08:03,618 --> 00:08:05,495
And fought back with the same trick.

155
00:08:05,495 --> 00:08:07,748
But when did Bao Rongxing
decide to use An Eye For An Eye?

156
00:08:07,748 --> 00:08:09,760
I didn't notice that.

157
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:11,140
It was that Intimidation Skill.

158
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:14,822
Although it didn't stop the
Invisible Green Hornet's attack.

159
00:08:14,822 --> 00:08:17,960
But it bought a brief gap for Bao Zi.

160
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:20,280
But... He didn't play his best trick vexedly.

161
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:23,380
But to reverse their position
by using Knee Attack.

162
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:26,120
And got behind his back to seize the opportunity. Turned the tables finally.

163
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:29,105
He forced the Invisible
Green Hornet into blind angle and killed him.

164
00:08:29,105 --> 00:08:31,471
Congratulations on Bao Rongxing. He won this round.

165
00:08:31,471 --> 00:08:34,625
An incredible victory!

166
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:41,240
Good!

167
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:43,800
Bao Zi. I won!

168
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:45,580
Well done!

169
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:47,640
- Incredible!
- You are so tough!

170
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:48,960
You are promising now.

171
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,700
You know how to use tricks now.

172
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:52,440
An Intimidation Skill with An Eye For An Eye.

173
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,560
How did you come up with that?

174
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:58,678
Are you let him forced you
into the blind angle on purpose?

175
00:08:58,678 --> 00:09:00,320
The blind angle?

176
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,860
Was that a blind angle?

177
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:06,160
The location where you almost lost.

178
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,835
Don't you know that?

179
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,200
I didn't think about it that much.

180
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,400
He was chasing me at the beginning.

181
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,100
And I just kept running. Ran and ran.

182
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:15,768
Then I felt so humiliated.

183
00:09:15,768 --> 00:09:17,100
I thought I should intimidate him a little bit.

184
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:18,900
I didn't expect that he would
use a ultimate skill on me.

185
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:21,560
And then I used An Eye
For An Eye without thinking.

186
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:24,100
I thought the most important thing is to be alive.

187
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:26,100
Fortune always favours fools.

188
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:29,200
Well done! Just keep trying.

189
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,200
- Fighting!
- Fighting!

190
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:33,400
Next is the third round of Individual Event.

191
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,600
- Xing Xin Team sent Mo Fan.
- Fighting!

192
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:39,500
And Zhu Xian Team sent Zhang Shu.

193
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:43,880
Captain is so drawling.

194
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,580
We don't know when will he come back.

195
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:47,800
Just play to your strengths later.

196
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,060
Go and find a place to hide.

197
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:52,960
Never launch an attack unless you have to.

198
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,700
Do you understand?

199
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,600
I've not finished yet.

200
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,200
Okay. The third round is going to begin.

201
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,520
Mo Fan from Xing Xin Team vs.
Zhang Shu from Zhu Xian Team.

202
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:04,220
It's a battle between Ninja and Knight.

203
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:07,280
Speaking of it,
Mo Fan did a great job in Team Competition.

204
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:09,860
This is his first time to take
part in the Individual Event.

205
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:12,840
Deception is a famous Scrap
Picker in the Field of God.

206
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:15,380
His individual combat capability should be good.

207
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:18,700
Actually, I'm looking forward to it. Will he take his opponent as a prey today?

208
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:21,300
To obtain his opponent's equipment.

209
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,840
They are ready.

210
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:29,380
Please get into the competition
room for final preparation.

211
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:31,050
Please.

212
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:43,100
Okay. They have entered the map. The third round starts!

213
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:50,420
In the very beginning,
Deception choose to hide himself.

214
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:53,180
It seems like he is looking for a sneak attack.

215
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,300
They are very close.

216
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:01,500
The Knight will be attacked
firstly if he hasn't found out yet.

217
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,880
Knight vs. Ninja. It's a tough fight for Ninja.

218
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,400
Knight has the most strong defensive power.

219
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:08,800
Ninja needs to be very
careful to exhaust Knight's HP.

220
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:12,300
Fighting! Fighting! Fighting!

221
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:14,300
There is an opportunity! Zhu Yue didn't realize Deception at all.

222
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:16,500
Deception is going to launch an attack.

223
00:11:18,381 --> 00:11:20,700
What's going on? Mo Fan didn't choose to attack.

224
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:22,460
Was it the wrong timing?

225
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:24,880
It seemed like a good timing.

226
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,200
Such a good chance. What a pity!

227
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:31,700
The knight has turned around. Deception can't launch an attack momentarily.

228
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:47,220
He's still looking for opportunities. He is getting closer to the knight.

229
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:48,560
Scrap Picker's character is to forbear.

230
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:52,160
It seems like he won't attack unless he is sure.

231
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,700
There's a chance!

232
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:00,520
But why did he give up again?

233
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:02,480
It's not like a Scrap Picker.

234
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,760
What is he doing?

235
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:07,940
Is he waiting for a better timing?

236
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,400
He is procrastinating.

237
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:16,273
Yellow card warning.

238
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,120
What?

239
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:24,580
If you don't attack in half a minute,

240
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:27,000
you will get a red card warning.

241
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,140
Mo Fan was penalized to be passive in game

242
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:30,800
for didn't launch attacks for a long time.

243
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,500
He got a yellow card warning.

244
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:33,840
It's so surprising.

245
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:37,380
I almost forgot about this rule if the referee didn't give this penalty.

246
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:40,240
You asked him to do it.

247
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:43,200
I just asked him to delay the time a little bit.

248
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,460
I didn't know he didn't even
know the rules of the game.

249
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:48,151
You know him well.

250
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:51,500
Okay. The game is continued.

251
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:53,900
As expected, he didn't seem
like the same person at all.

252
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:57,440
But it's not a good time to attack the knight.

253
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:00,000
Is he going to fight with the knight fave to face?

254
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,480
Nice!

255
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:10,260
With Deception's attacks, Zhu Yue can't fight back at all.

256
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:15,040
Zhu Yue is losing his HP. It seems like Deception is going to win.

257
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:17,180
But he used his skills too often.

258
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:19,280
What's his plan in the following?

259
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:27,160
Why he chose to run away at this critical moment?

260
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:30,200
You can see that...

261
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:32,200
There is no ultimate skills in his skill books.

262
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:34,780
All of his skills are freezing. Deception was caught by the Knight,

263
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:36,380
he can't use his Escape Skill yet.

264
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:39,860
If it goes on like this... Deception is going to die before his skills get unfrozen.

265
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:42,200
He can do nothing after using the common skills.

266
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,800
It seems like he is still
play like a Scrap Picker.

267
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:47,839
Yeah. He didn't seize the opportunity in the beginning. And he made some mistakes.

268
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:51,220
His play wasn't very stable
after the yellow card warning.

269
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:55,260
To against such a professional player, and Knight has such a strong defensive power.

270
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:59,000
You can't expect to kill him so easy.

271
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,800
- What a pity! 
 - Mo Fan is still lack of experience.

272
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,181
He didn't seized the opportunity in the beginning.

273
00:14:03,181 --> 00:14:05,180
But to be labile after he got a yellow card warning.

274
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:06,100
He was not calm enough.

275
00:14:06,106 --> 00:14:08,100
Congratulations on Zhu Xian
Team. They got one point.

276
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:13,040
Xing Xin hold a 2-1 lead over the Zhu Xian now.

277
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:17,500
- Well done!
- It's fine.

278
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:22,920
It's fine. It's not your fault.

279
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:24,840
You just wanted to buy some time.

280
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:28,560
I will make Ye Xiu to say
thank you when he is back later.

281
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:23,100
The decision has came out.

282
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,600
Do you want to know the result?

283
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:29,700
You're suspended.

284
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:35,760
I always thought we would meet in the final.

285
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:38,000
What a pity!

286
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,800
You're out early.

287
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:47,160
Maybe I am out.

288
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:49,360
But Xing Xin Team won't.

289
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:53,240
Do you know the scores of your team now?

290
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,900
I've known you for so long.

291
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:05,960
But I don't even know what you really want.

292
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:09,900
I could see that our friendship...

293
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:12,160
is so intriguing.

294
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:17,000
But it's good.

295
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:22,000
We won't meet in the final.

296
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,440
In case of our friendship gets worse.

297
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:33,320
The fame is fake.

298
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:40,080
But the feelings and experiences are true.

299
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,640
We've got two points.

300
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:43,400
We hold a 2-1 lead over the Zhu Xian now.

301
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:45,900
We still have a good chance to win.

302
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:51,900
We have to fight for Ye Xiu before he is back.

303
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:56,100
Tang,

304
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:58,800
- what do you think about the Arena Contest? 
 - One-against-three.

305
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,760
I will do what I said.

306
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:02,940
That's right.

307
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:04,640
We should be overwhelming.

308
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,300
We should be confident.

309
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:09,460
We will not only take down the Arena Contest, but also the Team Competition.

310
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:11,500
Come on! We will make it!

311
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:13,500
Come on!

312
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:19,740
Fighting! Fighting!

313
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:21,020
Fighting!

314
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:22,980
Don't worry.

315
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:24,820
One-against-three.

316
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:28,261
Xing Xin Team appointed
Tang Rou for the first round.

317
00:17:28,261 --> 00:17:31,389
- Zhu Xian Team appointed Ke Jian.
- Ke Jian.

318
00:17:31,389 --> 00:17:33,440
Please welcome them to come to the stage.

319
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:36,600
Ye Qiu is absent. Here's the chance.

320
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:39,480
Fighting. Fighting. Fighting.

321
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:40,960
One-against-three.

322
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,120
One-against-three.

323
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:43,380
One-against-three.

324
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:44,480
One-against-three.

325
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,740
- One-against-three. 
 - One-against-three.

326
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:48,900
Here comes to the Arena Contest.

327
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:51,100
Xing Xin Team appointed
Tang Rou for the first round.

328
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:52,720
Zhu Xian Team appointed Ke Jian.

329
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:56,677
I heard all the fans of Xing Xin Team are yelling One-against-three.

330
00:17:56,677 --> 00:18:00,320
Okay. In the following, Let's looking forward to the battle

331
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:03,460
between Battlemage and Assassin.

332
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:05,040
Ladies and gentlemen, the
first round of Arena Contest.

333
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:07,900
Han Yan Rou, a Battlemage
vs. Shui Youhan, an Assassin.

334
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:09,300
Game starts!

335
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:10,870
They both good at melee attack.

336
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:13,900
Maybe they will fight hard in the beginning.

337
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,660
Tang Rou used her consistent strategy.

338
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:20,260
She launched onslaughts to her opponent.

339
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:22,380
It's a hard fight between Battlemage and Assassin.

340
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:25,700
You will be hard to fight
back if you got attacked first.

341
00:18:55,760 --> 00:19:00,620
Shui Youhan only can seek
chances to consume her HP among Han Yan Rou's attacks.

342
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,280
The rhythm of this game is too fast.

343
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:11,600
We will see the result very soon.

344
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:27,720
Shui Youhan failed to
attack her back several times.

345
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:29,960
Han Yan Rou is going to win.

346
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,020
Now it's the time.

347
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:33,080
Shui Youhan only got five percent of HP.

348
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:35,100
Shui Youhan is running so fast. It's too fast. Struggled to blow.

349
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:37,000
Han Yan Rou reacts quickly. She stepped back.

350
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,600
Dragon Breaks the Ranks.

351
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:40,681
They hit each other at the same time. They perished together.

352
00:19:40,681 --> 00:19:42,320
But Han Yan Rou's HP goes to empty first.

353
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,700
Shui Youhan is the winner.

354
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:46,400
Bravo!

355
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,920
I am sorry, beauty. You took the bait.

356
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:52,860
Struggled to blow. He reversed the huge disadvantage successfully.

357
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:56,360
Tang Rou, as a newcomer, her APM and skills are remarkable.

358
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:58,820
But she lacks of experiences. Her opponent took advantage of it.

359
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:02,080
She didn't anticipate his intention at all. That led to her loss.

360
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:03,720
We believe she has learned a lesson from it.

361
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:06,580
Let's looking forward to
the growth of this newcomer.

362
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:09,847
Congratulations on Zhu Xian Team has took down the first round of Arena Contest.

363
00:20:09,847 --> 00:20:12,100
Tang Rou, you have to leave now.

364
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:13,720
She can't fight anymore, so...

365
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:17,280
They have two players now.

366
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,620
I am sorry.

367
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:33,080
It was too fierce just now.

368
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:35,040
The second round is going to start.

369
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:37,560
Xing Xin Team appointed their manager, Chen Guo.

370
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:41,760
Zhu Xian Team appointed their captain, Lin Yi.

371
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:45,480
Boss, it's your turn.

372
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,440
Really?

373
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:53,320
Relax. Just play steadily. Don't overexert.

374
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:56,600
I will get your back! It's okay.

375
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:57,780
Fighting!

376
00:20:57,780 --> 00:21:00,400
Play steadily. Don't overexert.

377
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,320
- Boss, fighting! 
 - Fighting!

378
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:03,320
- Fighting!
- It will be okay.

379
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:04,660
Boss, fighting!

380
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:05,900
Fighting! Fighting!

381
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:08,360
Captain, that's their Team Manager.

382
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:09,380
She is not a professional player.

383
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:11,520
Fighting! Fighting! Fighting!

384
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,640
Even the Team Manager has to play it herself.

385
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:16,040
It seems like Xing Xin
got into a big trouble today.

386
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:38,960
Okay. Here comes to the second round.

387
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:41,100
The Launcher of Xing Xin Team, Cloud Chaser.

388
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:42,560
Her opponent is the Swordsman of Zhu Xian Team.

389
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:44,080
Ten Thousand Swords.

390
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:46,600
They have entered into the map. Game starts.

391
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:51,200
Speaking of Cloud Chaser, she is the boss of Xing Xin Team, Chen Guo.

392
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,560
I didn't expect she will enter the field.

393
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:54,640
Chen Guo...

394
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,700
Play steadily.

395
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,580
Maybe I should hide.

396
00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:01,100
We could see that Cloud Chaser is very cautious to choose her dodging.

397
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:03,760
She has found a cover to hide.

398
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:06,300
Where is he?

399
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:09,980
But the position she picked is so terrible.

400
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:12,001
Ten Thousand Swords has found her and getting to her from the back.

401
00:22:12,001 --> 00:22:14,120
She didn't realize.

402
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:19,180
Ten Thousand Swords didn't attack her immediately.

403
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:20,840
He chose to remind her first.

404
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:22,640
Cloud Chaser turned around.
But her reaction was too slow.

405
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,320
Combo killed.

406
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,300
Cloud Chaser can't stop it at
all. She is losing her HP quickly.

407
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:27,780
Silver Blade. Got it!

408
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:31,720
Cloud Chaser is dead. Ten
Thousand Swords is the winner.

409
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:36,500
Ruo Feng, Chen Guo is the Team Manager of Xing Xin Team.

410
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:37,980
Her techniques are so amateurish.

411
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:41,800
Why did they choose this kind of deploy?

412
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,760
But not to appoint their
professional Launcher, Wu Chen?

413
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,000
Maybe...

414
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,240
She is the boss of Xing Xin Team.

415
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,600
And she wanted to play it for fun.

416
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,760
What are you talking about?

417
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,360
Play it for fun?

418
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:54,720
Our boss is not an irresponsible person.

419
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,120
What's going on?

420
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:57,800
Master is not here yet.

421
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:00,780
If there any possibles that he can't make it, so they let...

422
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:03,400
What are you talking about?

423
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:07,600
Sorry.

424
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:08,860
I can't help at all.

425
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:11,780
It's fine. It was a little
bit faster than I thought.

426
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:13,080
It's fine.

427
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:14,640
Boss, it's okay. You've tried your best.

428
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,360
You played well enough.

429
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:18,780
It's my show time.

430
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:20,180
- Fighting.
- Fighting.

431
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:22,920
In the following, Zhu Xian Team is going to be the defender.

432
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:25,520
Xing Xin Team appointed their veteran, Wei Chen.

433
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:28,341
Okay. The third player of Xing Xin Team, Wei Chen is on the stage now.

434
00:23:28,341 --> 00:23:30,940
Can he turn the tables? Let's see.

435
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:33,180
Well done!

436
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:35,160
In fact, your performance surprised me.

437
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:37,600
I thought we can defeat you easily.

438
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:40,640
But it seems like I have to work on it now.

439
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:45,460
I hope that your hands
won't get hurt in this game.

440
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:48,720
Okay. They have entered into the map.

441
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,240
Windward Formation. He thrown a magic missile at the very start.

442
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:54,360
He is using H&amp;R to contain Ten Thousand Swords

443
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:55,760
by using the advantage of terrain and hand length.

444
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,760
Very smart. Of course, he the master of Containment.

445
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,700
See?

446
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:04,681
They are getting closer. Ten Thousand Swords used the Sword Draw. Nice!

447
00:24:04,681 --> 00:24:05,761
Windward Formation lost some HP.

448
00:24:05,761 --> 00:24:07,540
Not bad!

449
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:10,201
Another Sword Draw. Missed it!

450
00:24:10,201 --> 00:24:11,760
Are you crazy?

451
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:14,860
It didn't work for me.

452
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:22,620
Five times.

453
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:24,120
He used the same...

454
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:27,360
No. He used the same skill six times.

455
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:28,480
But Wei Chen is a veteran.

456
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,940
He's very adept at adjusting the rhythm.

457
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:32,720
Ten Thousand Swords is in danger.

458
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,462
Six-light Prison! Got hit!

459
00:24:34,462 --> 00:24:36,554
Ten Thousand Swords is being controlled.

460
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:56,100
Windward Formation released the Chaotic Rain.

461
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:57,400
Ten Thousand Swords can't avoid it.

462
00:24:57,400 --> 00:25:00,261
He is losing his HP so quick. He is dead.

463
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:02,940
It was too stressful.

464
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:04,460
Wei Chen is a veteran.

465
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:06,280
Such a powerful attack...

466
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:08,220
It seems like Lao Wei really
can take down the Arena Contest.

467
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:09,640
Senior Wei is so great.

468
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:12,001
Okay. Windward Formation has won this round.

469
00:25:12,001 --> 00:25:14,040
Although Ten Thousand Swords'
strategy is so unpredictable.

470
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:16,861
But finally, he still lost this round.

471
00:25:16,861 --> 00:25:19,620
Although Windward Formation has won...

472
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:20,880
What's wrong with him?

473
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,500
Only repeat those skills again and again.

474
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:24,120
Zhu Xian Team still has a good chance.

475
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:25,940
Hey! You!

476
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:28,760
Just go back to your mama
if you are afraid to lose.

477
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:32,200
I hope you can say that again later.

478
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:34,801
In the following, Xing Xin Team is going to be the defender.

479
00:25:34,801 --> 00:25:38,400
Zhu Xian Team appointed Wang Luosi this round.

480
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:41,660
Please welcome Wang Luosi
to the stage for preparation.

481
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:43,295
Okay!

482
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:45,820
Fighting!

483
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:48,640
Just play as what I did.

484
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:51,161
Ladies and gentlemen, the Arena Contest between Xing
Xin Team and Zhu Xian Team.

485
00:25:51,161 --> 00:25:53,300
Finally comes the final decider.

486
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:55,604
Zhu Xian Team appointed their
Sharpshooter, Hua Nongying.

487
00:25:55,604 --> 00:25:58,200
His opponent is the Warlock of Xing Xin Team, Windward Formation.

488
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,382
Game starts!

489
00:25:59,382 --> 00:26:03,100
We can see that... These two profession
began to fight at the very start.

490
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,600
What's wrong with him?

491
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:11,100
Why will he play like a Swordsman?

492
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:13,920
It's so strange.

493
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:16,380
The Sharpshooter avoided Pursuit.

494
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:19,500
Just to repeat the same move.

495
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:23,180
Not only their Sharpshooter played like this, but also their Swordsman did.

496
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:27,240
Do they have any eccentricities? They are so sick.

497
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:29,420
The same skill. Hit!

498
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:30,760
Windward Formation got hit.

499
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:33,120
No. They did it on purpose.

500
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:36,040
They made me to repeat
such complicated techniques.

501
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:37,760
In order to stimulate my injured wrist.

502
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:39,840
So they can exhaust my strength.

503
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,680
That's right. Windward Formation can't follow up

504
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:43,040
the rhythm of attacks released by Hua Nongying.

505
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:45,260
His dodge was always one step behind.

506
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:47,790
We don't know if he can adjust his state in time.

507
00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:02,301
We can see that... Hua Nongying is still using
his captain's strange strategy.

508
00:27:02,301 --> 00:27:04,540
The HP on both sides is going to be zero.

509
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:05,820
It's a critical moment.

510
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:08,160
Who will die first?

511
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,920
Simultaneous attack! Hua Nongying dodged it.

512
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:15,420
Windward Formation got hit.

513
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:16,481
He is dead.

514
00:27:16,481 --> 00:27:18,320
Hua Nongying is the winner of this round.

515
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:21,480
Zhu Xian Team has won the Arena Contest.

516
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:22,420
What a pity!

517
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:25,640
Windward Formation almost
defeated two opponents continuously.

518
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:27,900
Congratulations on Zhu Xian
Team on winning the Arena Contest.

519
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:30,800
Zhu Xian Team hold a 4-2
lead over the Xing Xin Team now.

520
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:32,340
Xing Xin Team has to take
down the Team Competition

521
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:36,060
if they want to win this game.

522
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:07,140
The first half ended.

523
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:09,380
Xing Xin Team is two points behind.

524
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:13,620
Let's enjoy the Team
Competition after a short break.

525
00:28:17,894 --> 00:28:24,255
 

526
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:31,300
Captain's phone is here.

527
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:35,184
Where are they?

528
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:47,920
Captain is absent. What else can we do?

529
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:49,280
There are many other ways.

530
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:53,280
For example, Tang Rou can take captain's place.

531
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:55,440
Yi Fan can be a alternate.

532
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:58,078
We can put Bao Zi in...

533
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:02,120
There are many other ways.

534
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:04,440
But we haven't tried them before.

535
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:06,180
It means we have no other ways.

536
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:24,027
Lao Wei, let's drink some water.

537
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:26,800
It's okay.

538
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:28,875
We still have chance.

539
00:30:05,660 --> 00:30:06,800
What's wrong?

540
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:08,860
You can't even handle a zip-top can.

541
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:14,260
You said you are going to
finish one-against-three in public.

542
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:18,360
But you were a little bit cowardly today.

543
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:21,640
It's fine. You still have chance in the Team Competition.

544
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:24,940
Don't you want to challenge three of us?

545
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:29,560
By the way, don't make the same mistake again.

546
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:35,340
Don't worry. I won't make the same mistake twice.

547
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:43,500
Captain is going to lay out the new tactics.

548
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:44,940
Let's go.

549
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:47,560
She's broken down.

550
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:51,480
Xing Xin still has no chance
to win the Team Competition.

551
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:56,600
I've decided that we won't appoint Wu Chen.

552
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:58,120
Bao Zi will take Wu Chen's place.

553
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:00,320
Mo Fan, you will be the alternate.

554
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:02,960
We will lose.

555
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:04,840
What do you mean?

556
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:06,940
The Individual Event. The Arena Contest. We all listened to you.

557
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:09,440
And what's the result? We only got two points.

558
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:13,900
I suggest that... We should follow Captain Ye's strategy if we want to win.

559
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:16,340
We should put Wu Chen in the first formation.

560
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:19,160
Bao Zi, you are in charge of...

561
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:21,360
Wu Chen is an invincible
opponent to Zhu Xian Team.

562
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:24,100
Captain has his own reason
to let him enter the field.

563
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:26,100
Wu Chen is a Launcher.

564
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:29,520
He has advantages in the Team Competition.

565
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:32,720
Lao Ye is still not back yet.

566
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:36,820
Yi Fan, you are in the first formation.

567
00:31:41,499 --> 00:31:43,020
 

568
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:45,600
I don't know what's your reason.

569
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,800
And I don't know
why Wu Chen is not here at this moment.

570
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:49,360
We are a team. I just want to tell you...

571
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:52,760
Please don't put your feelings
before the benefit of our team if you want to win.

572
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:53,920
My personal feelings?

573
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:55,060
I just want to win so much that...

574
00:31:55,060 --> 00:31:58,060
I can't take our team's fate as a stake.

575
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:01,240
I have my own reason.

576
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:02,920
Please trust me.

577
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:04,621
- What should we believe in you? 
 - Stop it!

578
00:32:04,621 --> 00:32:05,860
Rookie!

579
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:07,040
What are you talking about?

580
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:08,660
You thought everything I did was wrong, right?

581
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:10,300
Stop it!

582
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:13,580
Go back to your seats.

583
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:29,660
It was not Lao Wei's fault.

584
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:32,280
It was not your fault neither.

585
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:36,171
We should blame on ourselves.

586
00:32:36,171 --> 00:32:39,440
We forgot our tactical training for drinking.

587
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:46,320
According to our usual practice,
let's vote for it.

588
00:32:56,682 --> 00:32:58,600
 

589
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:01,620
Three vs. three now. Tie vote.

590
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:04,320
Yi Fan, how about you?

591
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:09,280
I abstain.

592
00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:24,780
As the team manager, I will make the decision.

593
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:28,304
Listen to Lao Wei.

594
00:33:28,304 --> 00:33:30,833
 

595
00:33:30,833 --> 00:33:34,340
 

596
00:33:35,010 --> 00:33:37,280
 

597
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:40,200
Hello.

598
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:50,420
You only got two points in the first half.

599
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:55,120
That best newcomer has collapsed.

600
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:56,240
What's more?

601
00:33:56,240 --> 00:34:00,080
Although Wei Chen is a veteran.

602
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:04,640
But his strength has reached its limit.

603
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:07,400
The most horrible thing is...

604
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:10,120
Your boss has to enter the competition herself.

605
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:12,440
What else can you do?

606
00:34:23,866 --> 00:34:26,160
The game is not over.
