24
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:37,000
Our competition result being like that,

25
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:42,600
we shouldn't blame Lao Wei on his command
or blame your performance.

26
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:46,440
It's only because that all we knew is drinking

27
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:49,720
and forgot the tactic arranged by our captain.

28
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,280
Let Wu Chen play or not.

29
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,480
As usual, let's vote.

30
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,200
Now, three to three.

31
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:09,840
It's a tie.

32
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:12,640
Yi Fan, what about you?

33
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:17,480
I abstain.

34
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:33,040
As our team manager, I'll make the decision.

35
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:36,800
Wei Chen's decision is mine.

36
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,272
 

37
00:02:38,272 --> 00:02:42,500
 

38
00:02:43,257 --> 00:02:46,720
 

39
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,280
Hello.

40
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:58,760
Xing Xin Team only got two points
in the first half of the game.

41
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:03,380
Is your so-called the best novice beauty in unbalanced mental condition?

42
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:08,220
And although Wei Chen is a seasoned veteran,

43
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:12,880
his physical strength has reached the limit.

44
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:18,440
The most terrible thing is
that even your boss joins the game in person.

45
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:20,640
How do you continue this game?

46
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:34,020
The game is not over yet.

47
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:37,880
But time is running out for them.

48
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:46,020
Ye Xiu.

49
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:50,160
Face the truth.

50
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:54,640
Without you, Xing Xin Team doesn't have the soul.

51
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,260
Our chairman is coming back soon.

52
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:02,840
You will hear the official verdict in no time.

53
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:07,400
This is the end of your game career.

54
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,320
Everyone is coming to hear the results.

55
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:24,580
The league's punishment for Ye Xiu is to ban him from The Glory.

56
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:25,880
You give ban to Lao Ye.

57
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:28,120
What's the meaning for us to play the game?

58
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:32,180
Well, if you do this, why don't you ban us all.

59
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:33,960
Shao Tian.

60
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:49,460
We know that you are Ye Xiu's friends.

61
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:52,560
But the problem can't be
solved if you are so impulsive.

62
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:58,260
If you don't agree, you must give league a convincing reason.

63
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:02,520
Okay. We have too many reasons. Such as...

64
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:07,280
Most of tactics and methods using in the League were created by Ye Xiu.

65
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,740
If we lose him, the text book,

66
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:12,940
so many fantastic playing methods will become mediocre.

67
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:15,880
And tactics will not have new creation.

68
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:18,700
Yes. Tactics of this game will cease to update.

69
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:21,340
Training of newcomers will also have a break.

70
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:23,960
There are too many novices

71
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:26,620
who watch Ye Xiu's contest
video over and over again,

72
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:29,780
and fight against him round by round, so that they can grow up.

73
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:33,920
Now, Ye Xiu should completely retreat with his proud results.

74
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:38,680
But he chose to stay side by side with the grass-roots team.

75
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,800
Why?

76
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:45,640
Because these new players he cultivated are the future of Glory.

77
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:50,840
In addition to the newcomers, there are also veterans in the league like us.

78
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:54,800
As long as Ye Xiu holds on for one more day,

79
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,820
we will not leave the game in a sloppy way.

80
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:59,080
For me, personally...

81
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:08,540
No, for many of us, Ye Xiu is our best opponent.

82
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:12,500
As long as Ye Xiu is in this game, we will never stop practicing.

83
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:15,700
We will constantly look for new methods to beat him.

84
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:20,000
I am very glad that there is such a peak like Ye Xiu in Glory,

85
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,800
so that we can always keep the enthusiasm for climbing.

86
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,580
Well said. Now, do you understand?

87
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:27,880
There are too many reasons.

88
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:35,980
Shao Tian, go on.

89
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:38,340
Chairman Feng, how much
Ye Xiu contributed to Glory?

90
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:40,680
I believe that you know better than us.

91
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:44,820
But what's more important than contribution is to accompany.

92
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:47,881
I don't know how to describe this feeling of companionship.

93
00:06:47,881 --> 00:06:50,800
The Glory occupies our time and youth,

94
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,380
while we make the game full of life.

95
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:56,780
We dedicate our youth to it while it gives us glory.

96
00:06:57,980 --> 00:07:02,280
So, we just hope that league could decide cautiously.

97
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:06,000
After all, not only Lao Ye has fought for ten years,

98
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,520
but also thousands of players have fought for ten years together

99
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:15,280
In what role do you come here?

100
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,600
We are professional players of Glory.

101
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:46,120
Shao Tian, have a seat.

102
00:07:57,380 --> 00:08:00,060
I understand your feelings.

103
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:04,700
On behalf of my own opinion, Ye Xiu is a great player.

104
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:07,900
He brought Glory many surprises.

105
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:09,940
Personally, I want him to stay in this game.

106
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:14,740
However, it is true that he broke the rules.

107
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:17,380
You are professional players.

108
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:21,440
I hope you respect the decision of the League.

109
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:29,840
Now it's time for Team Competition between Xing Xin Team and Zhu Xian Team.

110
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:34,900
Let's welcome two teams into game rooms. Welcome.

111
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,400
Come on, come on, everyone.

112
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,820
Fighting.

113
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:44,020
Lao Ye, I bet you will come.

114
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:46,240
I am counting on you.

115
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:52,161
Okay, the next is Team Competition.

116
00:08:52,161 --> 00:08:54,500
In the previous Individual Event and Arena Contest

117
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:55,900
the Xing Xin Team only scored two points.

118
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:57,760
Their situation is quite unfavorable.

119
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:01,240
Even in this case, Xing Xin Team did not
let Master Ye Qiu play first,

120
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,301
but makes him as a substitute.

121
00:09:03,301 --> 00:09:05,300
What is this tactic? Ruo Feng.

122
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:07,760
I noticed that in Individual
Event and Arena Contest

123
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,740
their leader Ye Qiu didn't appear.

124
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:13,180
I don't know if it's something goes wrong, or it's just a special tactic.

125
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:16,040
Whether it is a special tactic or any unknown situation,

126
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:17,500
let us find it out in the game.

127
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:19,340
Team Competition between
Xing Xin Team and Zhu Xian Team.

128
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:20,980
The game starts now.

129
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:23,280
We can see that in the beginning, these five Xing Xin's players
are clinging to each other.

130
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:26,200
But, unusually, instead of moving towards their rival's position,

131
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,820
they make a detour,

132
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:28,860
Yes. The five member of Xing Xin...

133
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:30,800
Remember to follow our plan.

134
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,800
We should stall for time as far
as possible to wait for Lao Ye.

135
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,460
Windward Formation is in the middle

136
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:38,500
Han Yan Rou pretects their Cleric Cold Hands well.

137
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:42,220
Pay attention to the
environment around. Watch out.

138
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:43,840
Xing Xin goes very carefully.

139
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,560
They cling together, whenever anything goes wrong,

140
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:48,641
- Move on. 
 - They would stop to check out.

141
00:09:48,641 --> 00:09:50,260
This is not like the style of Xing Xin Team.

142
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:52,520
Master Ye Qiu, their core
of tactics, is not present,

143
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:55,000
their playing methods become a little passive.

144
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:08,200
Consume their energy and stall time.

145
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:38,980
Shui Youhan is pestering Han Yan Rou and Cold Hands.

146
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:40,620
The Assassin is very flexible.

147
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:42,600
He can use narrow terrain to keep dodging.

148
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:45,720
So Han Yan Rou can't reach him.

149
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,780
Hey, beauty. Don't be angry.

150
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:51,300
You said that you will not fall twice
in the same place.

151
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:53,850
Now that I am here,
how are you going to take revenge?

152
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,360
Xiao An, it's dangerous.

153
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,860
Now Han Yan Rou has to fight against two persons.

154
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:30,600
What's the hurry? Didn't we say we'd play together?

155
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:34,620
It's more interesting for
Assassin to play with two people. Isn't it?

156
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:38,060
We all want to see will you fall twice in the same place?

157
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:40,160
Yes. The double Assassins
of Zhu Xian are very confident.

158
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:43,900
They ignore the Cleric
directly and storm Han Yan Rou.

159
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:52,660
Let's look at the other side. Three to three.

160
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:54,940
Windward Formation, Yi
Cun Hui and Bao Zi, The Invader

161
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:57,900
fight against Ten Thousand Swords, Hua Nongying and Freezing Desert of Zhu Xian Team.

162
00:11:57,900 --> 00:12:00,840
Although two persons in Zhu Xian is carrying, they have Cleric as a support.

163
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,440
And they cooperate very well.

164
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:04,280
Their HP is controlled in a healthy state.

165
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:06,560
Meanwhile, let's look at Xing Xin. Their cooperation is a little rusty.

166
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,280
There are some problems with the cooperation.

167
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:10,520
Yeah. Comparing with Zhu
Xian's protection for Cleric,

168
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:13,300
Xing Xin did not give enough
space for Windward Formation to cast his skills.

169
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:14,760
His skills are frequently interrupted

170
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:16,900
And there's no chance for Yi
Cun Hui to release The Ghost Array.

171
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:20,780
Without Jun Mo Xiao, Xing Xin's ability declines too much.

172
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:24,000
Although Zhu Xian is lack of an attacker, their rhythm is much better.

173
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,120
Xin Xin has been playing
passive defense since begining.

174
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:28,100
It shouldn't be.

175
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,000
Windward Formation is jumping to the high point.

176
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,860
He wants to sort out the scattered formation.

177
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:46,860
Is he going to arrange a new tactic?

178
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:49,700
Tang, how can you leave the Cleric alone?

179
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:52,340
I must kill these two persons first.

180
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:58,600
Xiao An get back. I'll cover you.

181
00:12:58,600 --> 00:12:59,601
Tang, let's go!

182
00:12:59,601 --> 00:13:00,800
It's not worthy to fight against two Assassins.

183
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,020
You go first. Leave me along.

184
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:04,760
Cold Hands moves finally.

185
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:07,560
He is assembling with others But Han Yan Rou doesn't retreat.

186
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:09,180
She's still fighting with two assassins by force.

187
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:11,040
It's a little bit over.

188
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,460
Why didn't he hit the target?

189
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:15,861
What a pity! He wasted such a good chance.

190
00:13:15,861 --> 00:13:17,280
That's a big mistake.

191
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:18,340
He could have broken the impasse.

192
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:19,840
Now, he has to wait for another chance.

193
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:23,240
It seems that he was a little burned out in the previous Arena Contest.

194
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:30,600
Catch their Cleric.

195
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,220
Catch him!

196
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:35,640
Pay attention to your HP.

197
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:41,220
Xing Xin Team's aim is very clear.

198
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:42,720
They are restricting rival's Cleric.

199
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,660
But unfortunately, the effect is not obvious

200
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:48,960
Find a place to hide.

201
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,520
Understand.

202
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:59,620
Zhu Xian Team makes the same decision, to lay siege to Cleric.

203
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:01,020
Cold Hands makes good movement.

204
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:03,480
He keeps covering himself by the buildings, to make his rivals can't see him.

205
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,500
Howerver, the Sharpshooter
of Zhu Xian is right after him.

206
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:07,100
Cold Hands can't get chances to add blood.

207
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:08,760
His is still dodging. He is too passive.

208
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:12,060
In this way, it is possible
that Cleric of Xing Xin will be killed first.

209
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,940
Windward Formation arrives.

210
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:22,380
What? He missed the target. He hits a stone wall.

211
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:23,800
This is really a big mistake.

212
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,720
Cold Hands is indirectly injured by his teammate.

213
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,800
He is killed by Zhu Xian's attacker
with the help of his teammate.

214
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:30,140
Xing Xin's performance is really bad today.

215
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:33,181
Ruo Feng, do you think if Xing Xin still
has a chance to turn over?

216
00:14:33,181 --> 00:14:35,340
Sorry. I missed the target.

217
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:39,320
I was killed by my own teammate.
How can I play this game?

218
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:53,840
It's Assassin Heaven and
Earth Get Same Destination.

219
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:56,600
Well done. It seems that
she has learned the lesson,

220
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,200
she perfectly avoided their attack this time.

221
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:02,620
I won't fall twice in the same place.

222
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,940
Why she is so careless? She forgot to retreat

223
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:08,760
They complete a sneak-raid. Han Yan Rou is out.

224
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:13,340
But I didn't say that we will use the same skill

225
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:17,060
Zhu Xian Team killed one more player.

226
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:18,560
Now the score is two to zero.

227
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:21,540
It's likely that Zhu Xian Team would win the game.

228
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:23,860
If Ye Xiu doesn't come back sooner,

229
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:27,480
the match will end
before we have the chance to see their substitute.

230
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:38,260
After internal discussions,

231
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:42,400
the league will punish Ye Xiu

232
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,880
for using false name in the competition.

233
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:48,660
We decided to cancel all
the achievement he obtained in the name of Ye Qiu.

234
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:51,580
In other words, in the past eight years,

235
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:54,400
all of his achievements in Jia Shi don't count.

236
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:58,120
He must start from scratch as Ye Xiu.

237
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:02,180
Chairman, it's not the
ruling that you just stated.

238
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:05,980
May I ask why the league made this decision?

239
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:20,480
At present, Xing Xin's score is less
than Zhu Xian, as well as HP.

240
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,940
- I am afraid that the only
chance to reverse this situation 
 - Driver.

241
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:26,520
Is waiting for the substitute, Master Ye Qiu to create a miracle.

242
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:28,700
Driver. Stop.

243
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:29,721
Hold on, you two guys.

244
00:16:29,721 --> 00:16:31,100
Copy that.

245
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:49,380
Hey. Stop.

246
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:03,460
We can see that the magic power of
Wand of Death has been condensed

247
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:06,500
and he will cast this skill in no time.

248
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:48,200
Now Zhu Xian has three more players.

249
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,740
Their point is five to two now.

250
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:51,920
The situation of Xing Xin is
getting more and more difficult.

251
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,500
It's very hard to reverse the game trend.

252
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:54,960
Yes, in such a bad situation,

253
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,320
even though Jun Mo Xiao can arrive here in time,

254
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:57,760
I'm not sure that he can turn it all around.

255
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:00,161
Well, can we congratulate Zhu Xian Team in advance?

256
00:18:00,161 --> 00:18:02,180
No, no. The game doesn't come to the end.

257
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:04,960
We don't know what will happen.

258
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:18,540
If we follow our Captain's tactics, let Wu Chen play.

259
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:20,140
We wouldn't be in this bad situation now.

260
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:22,180
It already happened.

261
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:23,940
Don't say it any more.

262
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:25,480
It already happened. What do
you mean? What do you mean?

263
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:26,720
Do you mean we alredy lose the game?

264
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:30,700
What I mean is that there is no need to go on.

265
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:32,000
Five to two.

266
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,980
Yi Fan's HP is almost running out.

267
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:37,700
It will only be more shameful if we continue to fight in this way.

268
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:08,660
It's Jun Mo Xiao!

269
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:10,280
It's the captain, the Master of Xing Xin!

270
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:12,300
He finally got here.

271
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:19,380
Master! Master!

272
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:28,140
I've promised to bring him back.

273
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:45,360
It's so great!

274
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,700
Finally, Xing Xin can fight back! It's time to beat back!

275
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:49,140
Yi Fan, ahead on your left, the array of ice.

276
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:50,940
Control the Sharpshooter and the Swordsman.

277
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:52,920
Bao Zi! Use brick to knock the Cleric in the back.

278
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,400
Then find a place to hide quickly.

279
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,480
Yes, sir.

280
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:02,600
- What shall we do? 
 - Don't be freaked out.

281
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:05,181
No matter how good Ye Qiu is, can he defeat six of us?

282
00:20:05,181 --> 00:20:08,161
What we have to concentrate on is to find them out soon.

283
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:11,260
We can see that Zhu Xian become very careful.

284
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:12,480
Even we still have six people alive,

285
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:15,060
we should keep in line and
don't stay too far from each other.

286
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:17,400
We only have three people left.

287
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,420
They still have six counting the substitute in.

288
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:21,060
Their Cleric is still alive.

289
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:24,040
Normally, we can't win anyway.

290
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:27,260
We could only wait a chance to surprise them.

291
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:29,780
Captain, what kind of surprise?

292
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:33,260
Jun Mo Xiao appears.

293
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:42,040
Lead them to the cliff.

294
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:53,480
Where can you run to this time?

295
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:55,680
Give up, Master Ye Qiu.

296
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:57,720
Jun Mo Xiao is ringed
by the five members of Zhu Xian near the edge.

297
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:00,370
Is it Ye Qiu's tactic?

298
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:05,020
Not necessarily. Bao Zi.

299
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,520
A remarkable turnaround!

300
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,520
At the last moment of the match, there is a remarkable turnaround!

301
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:22,020
Xing Xin uses the terrain for a remarkable turnaround!

302
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:26,440
Nobody has thought of that the cliff can be broken in that way. Beautiful!

303
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:28,880
Everyone falls off except Yi Cun Hui!

304
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:31,440
If they really fall off,
they will die immediately.

305
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:34,020
It's so surprising. I can't believe this is how Xing Xin makes it!

306
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:35,960
They do even the odds.

307
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,000
Sure enough, Ruo Feng.

308
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,860
No one can predict the result until the last second.

309
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:44,340
In such a great disadvantage, Xing Xin's tactic is really a big surprise.

310
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,160
It's impossible.

311
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,400
Someone goes directly out now.

312
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,880
But we can see that Ten Thousand Swords saved himself by using skills.

313
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:05,700
Zhu Xian's two assassin also stop their falling by using thier shinobigatana.

314
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:08,360
Zhu Xian's members are very tough.

315
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:12,160
We won't lose.

316
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:19,040
Bao Zi, the Invader! Well played!

317
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:20,360
He sacrifices his own life
to kill the two assassins.

318
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:23,540
One life for two assassins. Bravo.

319
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:29,840
Ten Thousand Swords and Jun Mo Xiao are still holding on.

320
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,600
Victory is still ours.

321
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,540
It's too early to say.

322
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:42,860
Again, Master Ye Qiu shows us how strong a Freelancer is.

323
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:45,881
Jun Mo Xiao is using Mechanical Rotor to ascend.

324
00:22:45,881 --> 00:22:47,860
Freelancer can use too many skills make movements.

325
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:49,240
Don't be too proud.

326
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:51,600
Even if I lose, I will kill you first.

327
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:55,680
Oh, no! Ten Thousand Swords jumps up to catch Jun Mo Xiao.

328
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:58,601
If he goes on like this, Mechanical Rotor can't
hold the weight of two people.

329
00:22:58,601 --> 00:23:01,720
The stamina of the weapon will decrease quickly.

330
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:06,485
Jun Mo Xiao is still holding on, 
  

331
00:23:06,485 --> 00:23:09,960
but the thousand-machine umbrella's
stamina is decreasing too fast.

332
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:19,680
Does Ten Thousand Swords want
to die with his opponent together?

333
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:22,320
He interrupts the skill Mechanical Rotor.

334
00:23:23,558 --> 00:23:24,774
 

335
00:23:24,774 --> 00:23:25,641
Yi Cun Hui's HP is low.

336
00:23:25,641 --> 00:23:28,680
The substitute of Zhu Xian, the Berserker comes in with excellent condition just now.

337
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:31,780
If Jun Mo Xiao is out, there is no chance for them to turn on a dime.

338
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:34,580
It seems that the match will come to an end.

339
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:48,080
Captain, my shoulder.

340
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,160
Yi Cun Hui stands up at such a pivotal moment.

341
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:54,040
He chooses to die together
with Ten Thousand Swords.

342
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:54,840
It's a brilliant rescue.

343
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:57,000
Jun Mo Xiao uses Eagle Stamp
to go back to the edge of cliff.

344
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,760
Captain, we are all counting on you.

345
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:04,400
By this time, the replacement, Berserker, is here.

346
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,600
The final duel.

347
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:08,800
I think everyone knows the strength of both sides.

348
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:12,180
I'm afraid Xing Xin will be the winner.

349
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:26,980
Facing the assault from master Ye Qiu, Zhang Jian has no chance to fight back.

350
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:29,560
Master Ye Qiu will win!

351
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,720
Make the Blood Boil

352
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:11,940
Berserker rushes forward. Landslide.

353
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:21,040
At this break point, the thousand-machine umbrella is worn out.

354
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:22,340
It's really a tremendous surprise!

355
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:23,700
The downward trend goes into reverse again.

356
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:25,440
A thousand-machine umbrella

357
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:28,560
may be the first broken silver
equipment in Glory's history.

358
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:54,960
It's broken. How can it be broken?

359
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:04,640
Well, let's congratulate Zhu Xian on their winning in Team Competition.

360
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,600
The winner of this match is Zhu Xian.

361
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:09,700
Although master Ye Qiu recovers the disadvantage on his own.

362
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:13,660
They lose the game at last because of the broken weapon.

363
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:26,221
The thousand-machine umbrella is made through the efforts of the whole team.

364
00:26:26,221 --> 00:26:28,400
Even if it can be repaired, it won't be easy.

365
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:31,260
It's going to be a long and hard process.

366
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:33,580
It's a tragedy for a Freelancer.

367
00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:36,860
It's also a tragedy disaster
for Ye Qiu and Xing Xin.

368
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:41,840
I'm designing a weapon like this.

369
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:43,721
I called it a thousand-machine umbrella.

370
00:26:43,721 --> 00:26:47,860
When I finished the design, you can crush the game and surprise all the players.

371
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:50,780
Great. I'll wait for the day

372
00:26:50,780 --> 00:26:52,680
when your umbrella is formed.

373
00:26:56,327 --> 00:26:59,713
 

374
00:27:04,657 --> 00:27:07,557
 

375
00:27:17,128 --> 00:27:20,071
 

376
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:37,900
Challenge produces an unexpected winner.

377
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:39,240
Jun Mo Xiao cracked in the game.

378
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:41,340
The favorite team to win,
Xing Xin, was heavily defeated.

379
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:45,280
Another favorite team to win, Jia Shi, won with a commanding lead.

380
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:46,560
Sun Xiang fought against three.

381
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:47,960
He cooperated well with Xiao Shi Qin.

382
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:49,440
They also excelled in the Team Competition.

383
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,080
In addition to the excellent
performance of Su Mu Cheng,

384
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:54,420
they successfully ranked first in the standings.

385
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:00,020
Tao, the favorite team to win, Xing Xin,

386
00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:02,221
may lose the chance to meet Jia Shi in the Finals.

387
00:28:02,221 --> 00:28:03,681
- What do you think about it? 
 - Can you say something about Xing Xin's failure?

388
00:28:03,681 --> 00:28:06,220
Can you say something about the former hero of Jia Shi, Ye Qiu,

389
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:08,820
and his performance in the match with Zhu Xian?

390
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:13,680
Listen everyone, Xing Xin has made
so many impossible things possible

391
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:16,140
since the Challenge started,

392
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:18,500
but everything has its own end.

393
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:21,100
So does Xing Xin.

394
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:23,780
If we describe Xing Xin as a black horse,

395
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:27,000
- it comes to its end now. 
 - Let's eat first.

396
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,360
We don't know who will be the winner at last.

397
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,200
Where are they?

398
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,660
I've told them.

399
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:36,920
They said they have no appetite.

400
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:40,960
They have to eat something.

401
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:44,360
It's not the end of the world. How can they eat nothing?

402
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:47,520
- I'll go and ask them to eat something. 
 - No. I'll go.

403
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:50,720
You can divide the tableware for them.

404
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,520
Bao Zi, it's time for dinner.

405
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:08,840
Okay, boss. I'm not hungry.

406
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:38,740
Account card is a medal of each member.

407
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:43,400
But it looks like my card is mocking myself now.

408
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:48,660
Practicing tirelessly is the daily life of every member.

409
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:54,300
But the practicing becomes a way to throw criticism of us into ourselves.

410
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:07,640
The cruel fact that we are unqualified stimulates every one of us.

411
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:10,400
This is the only consequence we got

412
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:12,940
because of our badly cooperation
and shifting responsibility.

413
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:21,420
Aging is something we have to face.

414
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:23,960
It's an avoidable fate.

415
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:30,380
Is my insistence a kind of help or holding back?

416
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:34,860
All the crisis covered by our victory

417
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:38,580
is exposed through the failure this time.

418
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:42,640
Each one of us gets into our own trouble.

419
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:45,100
Can we rise in rank? Can we get into the Final?

420
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:49,280
Can we get back to the League? It's not that important now.

421
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:51,800
We are disappointed

422
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:54,700
with ourselves.

423
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:43,280
I'm always afraid of coming back to this place.

424
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:47,100
This place reminds me of all the stories

425
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:49,680
about a thousand-machine umbrella

426
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:52,080
about me and Mu Qiu.

You! You! You!

442
00:33:27,401 --> 00:33:29,160
Don't you want to win by
going through the back door?

443
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:31,360
What do you want?

444
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:35,780
No, no, no. It's not... Why are you so careless?

445
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:37,720
It's... You are the one who broke it!

446
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:39,780
- Now you sues your victim before me! 
 - What are you talking about?

447
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:42,500
- It's because that you want to beat me. 
 - You! It's you. It's you.

448
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:44,040
You should take it! You did it on purpose, because you want to beat me.

449
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:46,861
- You did it on purpose. 
 - You were dealing in bad faith.

 ♫ But you try your best
not leaving regrets for me ♫

00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:59,820
No! How could it be me?

453
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:01,907
It's me. It's none of his business.

454
00:34:01,907 --> 00:34:04,010
How much is it? I'll pay for it.

455
00:34:04,010 --> 00:34:08,280
Alright. Pay for it. Give me the money.

456
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:09,840
Of course.

457
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:19,720
What's wrong? Did your money get stolen?

458
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:21,780
Don't play such tricks on me.

459
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:23,580
Come here. Come with me.

460

 ♫ interesting again ♫

00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:40,460
play video game with full

Take good care of him.

- Don't touch his treasure. 
 - Brother.

468

The arm of that Transformer has already broken. It's none of my business.
