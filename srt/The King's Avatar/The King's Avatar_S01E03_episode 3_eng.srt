00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
 - Go play it for everyone to see.  
 - Okay.

27
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,700
Hey, wait.

28
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:43,520
Did I just take a good picture of the grandmaster's profile?

29
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,400
Darn it! Let me check it again.

30
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:49,600
They're just the highlights from that match we want to watch, not your idol.

31
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,900
What do you know about it?

32
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:55,040
Playing well is just the technical charm.

33
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:59,800
But my grandmaster also has personality charm.

34
00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:06,340
   

35
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:10,700
This can't be.

36
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:13,600
I remember the photo that I put in this document clearly.

37
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,900
Why can't I find it now?

38
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,430

40
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,200
I have made up my mind. To reduce the possibility of failure,

41
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:42,200
let's attack him when he is running out of HP.

42
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,800
A teammate is immune to our attack.

43
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,200
What's the point of attacking him?

44
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,260
How about using stones? Stone damage is neutral damage.

45
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:51,460
As long as we use stones properly. It will surely cost him HP.

46
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:53,000
Go!

47
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:17,600
   

48
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:20,100
It's here. I found it.

49
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:21,860
Here you are.

50
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,800
What's going on?

51
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:33,080
I forgot that this TV cannot read the disk.

52
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:35,500
I remember this TV has a high-end interface.

53
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,800
It can be connected to this computer.

54
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:41,160
Can you finish your sentences all at once?

55
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:43,480
Who is the boss here?

56
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:46,401
- You are. 
 - Then you do it.

57
00:03:46,401 --> 00:03:49,600
Look at you. Such a lazy guy.

58
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:04,560
   

59
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,860
What?

60
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:59,140
Come on, come on, come on!

61
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:14,380
Slide kick.

62
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:26,400
A 180-degree sweep.

63
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:33,480
Really classic. No one can repeat it.

64
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,790
Come on.

65
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:37,390
   

66
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:40,560
What the heck?

67
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,161
 - Come on, come on.  
  - Awesome. 

68
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:49,280
Lord Grim?

69
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:54,840
What is this guy doing?

70
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:59,800
 Not bad! 

71
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:07,580
Wow!

72
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:15,600
Sand toss.

73
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,300
Gatling gun.

74
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:08,100
Four thorns in the air.

75
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:10,650
He plays just like Ye Qiu.

76
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:16,600
Ye Xiu. Ye Qiu.

77
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:22,580
Could he be Ye Qiu?

78
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:24,200
No way.

79
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:27,180
Chen Guo, what are you thinking?

80
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:50,320
 Congratulations to the player, Lord Grim... 

81
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:52,000
It's over!

82
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,300
Great!

83
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:58,080
 The first kill in 10th server of Spider Cave has been completed.

♫  Youth is the time for unstoppable progress  ♫

85

♫  Accompanied by confidence and strength  ♫

86
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:12,460
♫  Even if beaten to flee with wounds and bruises  ♫

87
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:17,320
♫  Desperation always gives rise to hope  ♫

88
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:20,200
 A task that can't be more simple 

89
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:23,440
 helps me find my long-lost enthusiasm. 

90
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,540
 It's like being back in my youth. 

91
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:30,120
 Encouraging words, smiles, and goals 

92
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:33,600
 will all inspire my desire for victory. 

93
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:42,400
I want to know if you did this because you could or if you did it deliberately, intentionally.

94
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:58,780
Boss, don't say anything else.

95
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:02,001
Just pick up your account book and deduct as much as you want from my salary.

96
00:09:02,001 --> 00:09:03,980
I absolutely have no objection.

97
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:08,160
You know what? You played so well.

98
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:11,060
You played just like Ye Qiu.

99
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:13,600
- You've earned me a reputation. 
 - That's right.

100
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,280
It seemed like you were possessed by Ye Qiu. That was a good fight.

101
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:17,640
He is my network manager.

102
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,840
The copy he just played is really nothing.

103
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:22,260
Oh, so you found out that he is a loyal fan of Ye Qiu.

104
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:25,000
He played really well.

105
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,880
If you want to pass the probation period,

106
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,860
just cooperate with me.

107
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:36,900
I love Ye Qiu, too. Ye Qiu loves me.

108
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:41,700
Sometimes, I even think I really am Ye Qiu.

109
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:44,220
You really do have the style of Ye Qiu from back in those days.

110
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:46,461
- Right? 
 - Boss, good choice.

111
00:09:46,461 --> 00:09:48,180
It's nothing, nothing.

112
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:50,420
To be my network manager,

113
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:54,140
there are just two requirements.

114
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:55,980
First, you have to have a name like Ye Qiu.

115
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:59,680
Second, play Glory like Ye Qiu.

116
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:05,000
You've got good judgment. Really good.

117
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,100
Come again.

118
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,900
So what about the probation period?

119
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:19,180
You passed.

120
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:22,640
Can you also offer a discount on the money I owe?

121
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:25,800
Discount? Sure.

122
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,440
Let me give you a 120% discount.

123
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:30,620
The debt has risen by 20%.

124
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,300
Keep smiling or...

125
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:38,760
the probation period continues.

126
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:53,000
Keep it up.

127
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:57,440
   

128
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,860
   

129
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:00,740
Did you write this?

130
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:04,940
Although you are now an intern at the magazine,

131
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:09,020
as a future journalist, you must be objective.

132
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:10,360
I am objective.

133
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:14,940
You have stated clearly in your article that Ye Qiu was forced to retire.

134
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:19,160
It was Excellent Era who asked Ye Qiu to leave to protect their interests.

135
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:21,500
- Do you have any evidence? 
 - Ye Qiu loves Glory so much.

136
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,520
It is impossible that he chose to retire so suddenly.

137
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:25,560
As you know, Excellent Era has two money-spinners:

138
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:26,980
Ye Qiu and One Autumn Leaf.

139
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:31,540
But the benefits are far less than being a captain of a second-tier team.

140
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:32,980
I've heard people say that

141
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:35,480
Excellent Era's senior... senior officials have long been dissatisfied with Ye Qiu.

142
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:38,220
Can this rumor be regarded as evidence for news?

143
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:39,620
But...

144
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:45,400
I know you are a loyal fan of Ye Qiu.

145
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:49,680
But remember, as a reporter,

146
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:53,820
you should also stick to the bottom line of the news.

147
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:55,160
You should learn from me.

148
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:59,520
No matter how great the reputation Ye Qiu has created among other people,

149
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:01,680
I only stick to one principle.

150
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:06,440
Listen to him personally, then you can write the truth.

151
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:12,580
That's right, Director Cao. I remember that you know Ye Qiu.

152
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:15,380
Can you introduce him to me? I can interview him.

153
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:18,260
After I check with him, I will know the truth.

154
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:19,920
Stop dreaming.

155
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:22,920
I have known him for eight years, and haven't ever seen his face.

156
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:25,340
Didn't you interview him before?

157
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:31,280
Don't you know there is something called QQ in this world?

158
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:55,361
 - What do you think of this form? 
 - No, it won't work. 

159
00:12:55,361 --> 00:12:57,000
 That's not right. Let me do it. 

160
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,260
 You haven't tried it. How would you know? 

161
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:01,721
 - I just knew it. 
 - Try to set the cannon on it. 

162
00:13:01,721 --> 00:13:04,140
 Try this cannon again. 

163
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:21,660
 Why are you two behaving so well today? 

164
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:25,720
 After sweeping the floor, washing the clothes, 

165
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,400
 and cooking lunch, then we can play on the computer. 

166
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,660
 Your instructions are orders we must follow, right? 

167
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:30,600
 Who washed them? 

168
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,220
 - Me. 
 - Me. 

169
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:35,040
 You? When did you wash them? 

170
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,620
 - I washed them, not you. 
 - Definitely, I did it! 

171
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:38,960
 Are you sure? 

172
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:41,060
 - I am sure. 
 - It was me. 

173
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:42,300
 You... 

174
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:46,220
 Why did you wash this with black pants? 

175
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:51,220
 Hurry up! What are you drawing? 

176
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:53,120
 Let her change into this. 

177
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:56,061
 - Are you sure? 
 - Don't worry. 

178
00:13:56,061 --> 00:13:58,040
 We have a T-shirt for you. 

179
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:02,040
 This black stain will become the most beautiful label for this T-shirt. 

180
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:05,120
 A unique T-shirt for the unique you. 

181
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,900
 What exactly are you drawing here? 

182
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:09,540
 It's a... 

183
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:15,220
 melancholy kitty. 

184
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:18,320
 Melancholy Kitty, this way, please. This way, please. 

185
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,500
 Look at the camera, look at the lens. 

186
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:22,460
 Three, two, one. 

187
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,740
Speaking about my acquaintance with Mu Qiu,

188
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:32,820
I should give thanks to gravity for giving me that lucky coin.

189
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:44,400
 My lucky coin. 

190
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:46,100
 Hey. wait. 

191
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,820
 Don't! 

192
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:18,900
 That's mine. 

193
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:20,500
 What? 

194
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:22,480
 A lucky coin. 

195
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:25,680
 Isn't that just a video game coin? 

196
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:28,520
 It is a birthday present from my sister. 

197
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,800
 Beat me, and I'll give you ten more. 

198
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,940
 If you lose, 

199
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:39,080
 think of it as your gift to me. 

200
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:41,680
 Why are you so unreasonable? 

201
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:46,000
 Same interests make us good brothers sharing our trials and tribulations. 

202
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:50,380
 My frivolous youth, my ambition, 

203
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:53,980
 and all my glory are related to him. 

204
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:58,820
 I will take the Myriad Manifestation Umbrella 

205
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:00,860
 and return to the top of Glory. 

206
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:18,608
   

207
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:03,440
 What's going on? 

208
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,580
 How did this happen on the stage? 

209
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:11,960
 I always thought that winning was the only thing that mattered in life. 

210
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:14,440
 So I didn't allow mistakes, 

211
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:16,540
 didn't accept failure, 

212
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:18,660
 and started all over again. 

213
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:22,060
 I only chose to leave. 

214
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:27,180
Xiao Tang, I am reviewing my lessons.

215
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:28,520
I didn't hear your phone call.

216
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:30,480
 Guo Guo, I have gotten off the plane. 

217
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,620
Now, I am on my way to the net cafe.

218
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:48,520
 An interlude during examination 
   

219
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:51,460
 became the beginning of my friendship with Guo Guo. 

220
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:56,460
 Hey, what are you doing? 

221
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:59,060
 Get that thief. Stop! 

222
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:02,620
 - Are you okay? 
 - I'm okay. 

223
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:04,240
 Get up. 

224
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:08,220
 I have to go first. Thank you. 

225
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:10,020
 No problem. 

226
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,500
 Your bag! 

227
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:17,000
 A mistake gave us the chance to meet again. 

228
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
   

229
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,900
 This internet cafe was left to Guo Guo after her father died. 

230
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:26,380
 Carrying on her father's career and making improvements 

231
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:28,560
 became her life goal. 

232
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:34,040
 And I became a great devil who urged her to learn and improve. 

233
00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:38,260
   

234
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:43,260
- The rules remain the same. 
 - Of course.

235
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:46,261
- I will be strict on you. 
 - Fine. I'll do it.

236
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:53,740
Xiao Tang, look at this.

237
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:55,880
I really finished my homework. Look.

238
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:58,000
Is she the boss's best friend?

239
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:00,920
No.

240
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:02,420
Old enemy?

241
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:13,780
Understood. A best friend is like an old enemy.

242
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:17,960
Little brat.

243
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:19,780
Little brat.

244
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:22,680
Network Manager, your old enemy is calling you.

245
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:26,260
Come here.

246
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,980
He's just a bit stupid.

247
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:32,200
Take the luggage up.

248
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,980
Xiao Tang, let's go.

249
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:36,380
Don't worry.

250
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:39,680
There's this. Take it too, okay?

251
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,980
Not heavy. Okay.

252
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:44,780
Let's go,  XiaoTang.

253
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:47,740
Go, go.

254
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:49,960
   

255
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:52,640
What word exercise book?

256
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:55,670
I almost ate it with my dinner.

257
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,961
You know what? If you give me a basin now...

258
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:02,060
If you were to give me a basin now,

259
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:05,860
I would spit out ink.

260
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:07,120
Pretty good, right?

261
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,940
Xiao Tong, don't worry.

262
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:12,980
This year, I will definitely pass it.

263
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,700
Guo Guo.

264
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:21,020
You have made great progress this year.

265
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:28,720
Xiao Tang, since you left, 268 days have passed.

266
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:31,820
And I have studied for 267 days.

267
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,980
Why is it one day short?

268
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:39,440
The missing day is today.

269
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:44,240
Because you are here,

270
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:47,060
I must accompany you.

271
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:49,360
Xiao Tang, didn't you miss me?

272
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:52,440
Let me tell you. A milk tea shop opened nearby.

273
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:55,320
It is very popular on the internet. There is a long queue every day.

274
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:58,400
Reasonable rest is called relaxation.

275
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,700
Unreasonable rest is called laziness.

276
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:03,420
I'm not lazy. I am...

277
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:05,481
- Ms. Chen Guo. 
 - Xiao Tang, you must trust me.

278
00:21:05,481 --> 00:21:09,040
Boss, I've brought these up.

279
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:11,340
Him. It's him.

280
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:14,060
He is the reason for my laziness.

281
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:19,500
XiaoTang, let me tell you something.

282
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:21,740
He seems to be a nameless network manager,

283
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:24,040
but he played Glory so well.

284
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:26,700
I lost every time without the strength to fight back.

285
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:28,600
How about this? I'm responsible for studying.

286
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:31,521
You are responsible for the challenge.

287
00:21:31,521 --> 00:21:34,120
Defeat this little network manager and win back my reputation.

288
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:36,160
Boss, I'm leaving.

289
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:37,860
Let's talk.

290
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:50,180
Please go talk to Xiao Tang.

291
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:52,260
Just ten minutes.

292
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:53,660
I have one page of homework to do.

293
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:55,800
Earn some time for me to make it up.

294
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:58,640
I'm afraid of being injured by mistake.

295
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:06,720
Do as I ask, and the debt between us will be forgiven.

296
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:11,340
What if it doesn't work?

297
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:15,440
Then you will be a dead man.

298
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:28,020
At this moment of self-examination,

299
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:30,840
no one can be a stumbling block to her.

300
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:37,220
I really don't want to play Glory with others.

301
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:39,280
The boss is my best opponent.

302
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:40,261
Why?

303
00:22:40,261 --> 00:22:42,260
She has been losing, and I have been winning.

304
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:45,060
What a good feeling it is to play Glory like this.

305
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:46,780
If she can beat me once,

306
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:50,240
I wouldn't have made her my sandbag.

307
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:56,240
Guo Guo, turn on the computer. Give me the card, and let's play Glory.

308
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:02,160
You will lose.

309
00:23:09,650 --> 00:23:11,700
   

310
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:10,740
   

311
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:15,930
   

312
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:57,340
   

313
00:24:57,340 --> 00:24:58,580
Continue?

314
00:24:58,580 --> 00:24:59,700
It's not the end yet.

315
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:02,200
It's just so boring.

316
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:04,140
It should be over soon.

317
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:19,620
Done.

318
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:31,680
This PK wasn't boring, was it?

319
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:39,720
 I finished today's review as scheduled. 

320
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:43,340
 But Xiao Tang seems to have some problems. 

321
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:48,380
 Many people will continue to do something because it's easy. 

322
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:50,600
 But Xiao Tang is the opposite. 

323
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:53,860
 When she encounters something difficult to deal with, 

324
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:56,040
 there is no need to say anything more. 

325
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:59,140
 She will spare no effort to continue. Just charge ahead. 

326
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:08,760
 The keyboard keeps clicking. 

327
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:10,920
 My Xiao Tang, 

328
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:13,700
 has her heart for victory or defeat risen again? 

329
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:40,440
You're kidding me.

330
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:47,460
Wait. Another round.

331
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:52,300
You must be joking. It's been ten rounds.

332
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:54,700
There is no reason to continue.

333
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:58,480
Your operation is quite fast.

334
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:00,860
But the coordination between your left and right hands is in a mess.

335
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:03,940
Adaptability and judgment of perspective change are basically zero.

336
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:05,500
The world of Glory is like that.

337
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:09,020
You might defeat me in 100 years.

338
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:13,900
Hey, that crossed the line a little.

339
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:21,280
Sorry, it was a little too much.

340
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:24,860
A hundred years is just an exaggerated description.

341
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:26,780
It wouldn't really take that long.

342
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:32,360
Off duty.

343
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,680
Xiao Tang.

344
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:42,800
Don't be unhappy. Smile.

345
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:44,420
Forget him.

346
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:46,940
He is a man who says whatever comes into his head.

347
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:49,380
Guo Guo.

348
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:52,060
Open an account for me.

349
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:53,760
What?

350
00:27:57,900 --> 00:28:00,240
Are you sure?

351
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:03,260
I want to use what he is best at

352
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:05,320
to personally defeat him.

353
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:09,620
In this Glory PK,

354
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:12,640
I am sure to win.

355
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:22,910
   

356
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:29,200
 Will it work? 

357
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:31,980
 - Come on! 
 - Come on! 

358
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:33,880
 Use the big skill. 

359
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:38,660
 - Wouldn't it be nice to use it earlier? 
 - Yeah. 

360
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:52,440
Hello, Guild Master.

361
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:54,140
Guild Master.

362
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:03,880
Coffee.

363
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:10,700
Since the opening of the 10th server, a total of 12 first-time killings have been recorded.

364
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:13,140
Herb Garden guild and Tyrannical Ambition guild achieved four respectively.

365
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:17,780
And our Blue Brook guild only achieved one so far.

366
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:27,140
There's a meeting.

367
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:32,060
According to the current situation,

368
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:37,040
I'm afraid we are a little distance from the target we set.

369
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:41,840
Xi Zhou,

370
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:44,520
is it true that we have only achieved one?

371
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,040
Why don't you stick all of them on?

372
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:51,860
Why don't you stick all of them on?

373
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:54,380
But fortunately, we are still rich in rare materials.

374
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:56,420
And the number of members is also steadily rising.

375
00:29:56,420 --> 00:30:00,420
There are 82 more members today than yesterday.

376
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:20,890
   

377
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:27,760
Do you know what the ranking of Team Blue Rain is in the league?

378
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,240
Do you know that a double-digit increase in membership

379
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:32,040
is not enough for such an ace team.

380
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:34,720
Do I really have to do everything myself?

381
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:42,800
All of you should do a deep reflection.

382
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:46,630
   

383
00:30:53,276 --> 00:30:55,056
   

384
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:01,100
   

385
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:06,060
What?

386
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:08,520
 Guild Master, it's time for the meeting. 

387
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:12,280
Wait a bit.

388
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:19,820
Guild Master, everyone is here.

389
00:31:21,490 --> 00:31:27,980
   

390
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:47,060
About the establishment of the 10th Server Guild,

391
00:31:47,060 --> 00:31:48,600
what suggestions do you have?

392
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:49,660
Guild Master.

393
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:52,020
There is an expert named Lord Grim in the 10th server,

394
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:53,580
who has taken three first kills recently.

395
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:55,180
And he hasn't joined any guild yet.

396
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:57,920
How about inviting him to join.

397
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:02,300
We are in a meeting.

398
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:07,580
Inviting experts?

399
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:11,340
Don't you all call yourselves experts every day?

400
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:13,620
How do we still need to recruit others to help.

401
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:15,703
If there is a problem, you shouldn't look for the reason among yourselves,

402
00:32:15,703 --> 00:32:18,041
but instead think about looking for external help. What kind of mentality is that?

403
00:32:18,041 --> 00:32:21,580
Besides, is this Lord Grim an expert? He is just lucky.

404
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:23,680
Nowadays, there are two reasons for those playing Glory without joining a guild.

405
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:26,300
First, they have poor skills, so they can't play well.

406
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:29,560
Secondly, there is something wrong with their character and guilds don't want them.

407
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:31,320
Other than these two reasons,

408
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:34,000
then he must be a spy.

409
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:40,290
   

410
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:43,140
 Blue Brook Guild? 

411
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,980
 A guild for the Blue Rain Team. 

412
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:48,720
 Fights for professional teams to get materials; has enormous potential. 

413
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:52,220
 They must possess a sufficient stock of rare materials. 

414
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:55,560
 My rare materials will soon deliver themselves to me. 

415
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:57,430
   

416
00:32:58,680 --> 00:32:59,820
Lord Grim added me.

417
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:01,140
Lord... what?

418
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:02,740
Added me.

419
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:08,420
You just said he was a spy.

420
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:11,700
Did I say that?

421
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:15,240
The meeting is not over yet.

422
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:23,660
I just said this Lord Grim may be a spy.

423
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:26,300
It's just a possibility.

424
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:27,760
It needs to be proven.

425
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:29,320
We don't know until we have confirmed it.

426
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:32,720
All in all, all of you should learn from me.

427
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:35,680
How can you just talk about inviting experts in?

428
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:36,960
Action.

429
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:40,860
That is the best way to set up a guild.

430
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:45,140
The meeting is over.

431
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:49,720
Come in.

432
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:50,840
New information.

433
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:52,880
Take a look at this data.

434
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:58,460
So mysterious. What's wrong?

435
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:03,260
He took three first kills, so what?

436
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:05,960
He can't fight back in front of me.

437
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:07,200
Did you defeat him in the PK?

438
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:10,900
I didn't. I defeated him in bargaining.

439
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:12,720
Bargaining?

440
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:24,040
When inviting experts, we should pay attention to strategies.

441
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:25,920
First of all, you have to understand his needs.

442
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:27,940
But hold the bottom line.

443
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:33,520
No matter what kind of experts, all can be captured.

444
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:40,060
I think for the word "soliciting,"

445
00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:41,600
you may have some sort of misunderstanding.

446
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:43,800
What's the matter?

447
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:47,880
At first, it was clearly a good process of soliciting.

448
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:52,140
You made it into a high-priced employment transaction.

449
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:54,340
Look.

450
00:34:57,460 --> 00:35:00,160
 Brother, you haven't joined any guild. 

451
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:03,000
 Do you want to consider joining our Blue Brook Guild? 

452
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,040
 I'm not interested for the time being. 

453
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:08,760
At the very start, you were very clear about your purpose.

454
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:10,960
But he refused you.

455
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:14,120
However, he left you a little hope

456
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:17,100
to make you feel there was still a chance.

457
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,580
 You are right. 

458
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:24,180
 You have to know more about us before making a decision. 

459
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:27,120
 Well, we're going to attack the Frost Forest. 

460
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:29,600
 We are short of a master like you, Bro. 

461
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:33,720
 Do you want to join us to feel the team atmosphere of our Blue Brook Guild? 

462
00:35:36,150 --> 00:35:38,080
 You want to challenge the record, don't you? 

463
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:40,860
 We're not that ambitious. Just giving it a try. 

464
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:43,960
You played the emotional card very tactfully to invite him to attack the Dungeon.

465
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:46,380
In the end, you also didn't forget to praise him as an expert.

466
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:49,760
So far, it was perfect.

467
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:52,500
But starting with this sentence,

468
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:55,700
you were completely immersed in his rhythm.

469
00:35:58,380 --> 00:36:00,940
 If you're only giving it a try, I'm not interested. 

470
00:36:00,940 --> 00:36:04,180
 No, no...! It's not just trying. 

471
00:36:04,180 --> 00:36:08,440
 As you know, bro, a Dungeon record in a new district 

472
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:10,900
 is very important for every guild. 

473
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:13,860
 Of course, we also want to break the record. 

474
00:36:13,860 --> 00:36:16,140
 Unfortunately, I am not a member of any guild. 

475
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:19,340
 I wouldn't know the importance of what you just mentioned. 

476
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:24,680
 It doesn't matter if he doesn't know the importance. 

477
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:30,420
 Expert, the important thing is you know what you want. 

478
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:33,200
 If the record is broken, the purple equipment is all yours. 

479
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:34,240
 What do you think? 

480
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:36,160
 I'm not interested in equipment. 

481
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:40,880
 Expert, what are you interested in? 

482
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:43,240
 Do you have any rare materials? 

483
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:46,220
To challenge the record was clearly what you should say.

484
00:36:46,220 --> 00:36:47,780
But he was the first to bring it up.

485
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:50,940
He planned to catch you off guard so you would think you were on the same side.

486
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:52,740
But you didn't expect the situation to change that fast.

487
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:54,840
His refusal upset your rhythm.

488
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:58,600
You had already lost when you became the first to panic.

489
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:06,360
 We certainly do. Our Blue Brook Guild has everything you want. 

490
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:07,640
 Thirty strong spider silks, 

491
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:08,840
 eight sharp teeth of white wolves, 

492
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:10,820
 and eight white wolf hairs. 

493
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:19,460
 Buddy, you're asking too much. 

494
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:22,220
 Didn't you say you have everything? 

495
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:28,960
 Yes, yes. But the three things you want 

496
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:32,000
 will take a lot of luck to obtain. 

497
00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:36,520
 You can only choose one of the three. 

498
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:38,900
 Then I choose the sharp teeth of white wolves, 

499
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:42,600
 and maybe a bit of some strong spider silk. 

500
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:43,940
 - How about 25? 
 - I... 

501
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:46,481
He raised the price at first to deliberately give you room to bargain.

502
00:37:46,481 --> 00:37:48,440
He makes you think you've taken the upper hand.

503
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:50,100
Later, he chose the cheapest one of the three,

504
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:51,780
the sharp teeth,

505
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:54,240
to purposely make you think he'd lost and you'd won.

506
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:56,680
In this way, he managed to take a weak position

507
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:59,460
to ask you for some spider silk.

508
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:02,240
This was all his plan.

509
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:04,060
And what you have promised him

510
00:38:04,060 --> 00:38:07,420
might be more than he wanted.

511
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:14,260
Still, I fell in his trap.

512
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:24,200
But the materials are still in our hands.

513
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:27,440
It's still our call about whether we give him those things.

514
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:34,165
 You need to give me a part of the materials before I enter the Dungeon. 

515
00:38:34,165 --> 00:38:37,320
What? Give him some materials in advance.

516
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,123
 A down payment comes first before the final payment. 

517
00:38:42,123 --> 00:38:43,641
   

518
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,920
Guild Master, wait a minute.

519
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:52,140
Can't you just wait a minute?

520
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:53,220
We have so many members in the Blue Brook guild.

521
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:54,800
He can't run away.

522
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:57,000
Everything is under my control.

523
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:00,520
 Then all of you listen to my command. 

524
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:03,261
Okay, okay. All right, let's attack the Dungeon.

525
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:45,040
Expert, how do we fight when we go?

526
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:05,360
I understand what the expert means.

527
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:07,920
This circle drawn by him

528
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:11,700
represents that we will fight together.

529
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:13,314
Inside the circle is the pure land,

530
00:40:13,314 --> 00:40:15,680
outside the circle is the battlefield.

531
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:17,680
That's right, isn't it?

532
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:22,100
What I mean is, you guys shouldn't move out of the circle.

533
00:40:32,260 --> 00:40:33,660
Wait.

534
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:46,080
What is his plan?

535
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:48,280
How dare he face the monster alone.

536
00:41:02,060 --> 00:41:06,740
Did he kill the monster or was he eaten by it?

537
00:41:06,740 --> 00:41:08,580
I'll go and check.

538
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:12,660
We need to give him a few more minutes.

539
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:14,980
Expert has his own strategy.

540
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:17,960
We must show our tolerance.

541
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:19,580
Then our tolerance is...

542
00:41:19,580 --> 00:41:21,380
Waiting.

543
