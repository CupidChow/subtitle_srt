25
00:01:39,378 --> 00:01:42,920
Leaping onto the wall,
Qiao launches a counterattack

26
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,700
while Xiao is alternating his skill strikes.

27
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:46,900
Playing a Ghost who relies on tactics,

28
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:51,298
the choice of skills and its casting time
are important.

 Subtitles and Timing provided to you by💥🍥 TEAM 7️⃣ 🍥💥 @viki.com 

30
00:02:01,617 --> 00:02:05,942
But Arrays of Ice and Plague
may not enough to turn the tide.

31
00:02:05,942 --> 00:02:08,643
He should use more Arrays of Ghosts...

32
00:02:08,643 --> 00:02:11,660
and cause high damage to
enemy by the Feast of Ghosts.

33
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:27,700
What happened?

34
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:29,946
Why did Xiao rush in the opposite direction?

35
00:02:29,946 --> 00:02:32,842
Tell us why, Captain Yu.

36
00:02:32,842 --> 00:02:36,047
Director, please replay these frames.

37
00:02:36,047 --> 00:02:37,522
Yeah, it's here.

38
00:02:37,522 --> 00:02:40,046
Xiao was shooting with his rifle
at the same direction,

39
00:02:40,046 --> 00:02:42,339
then hit the air with his Mechanical Punch.

40
00:02:42,339 --> 00:02:45,085
But nobody was here, Captain Yu.

41
00:02:45,085 --> 00:02:48,306
Let's see from Xiao's view.

42
00:02:48,306 --> 00:02:49,848
What...

43
00:02:51,345 --> 00:02:55,024
Shao Tian, have you seen it?

44
00:02:55,024 --> 00:02:57,506
It must be an afterimage that looks very real.

45
00:02:57,506 --> 00:03:00,700
It's not surprising that Xiao mistook it for Qiao.

46
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:02,900
But I think it must be a coincidence,

47
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:05,209
because a Ghost has no skill
creating an afterimage.

48
00:03:05,209 --> 00:03:09,494
So Xiao was just unlucky and
fell into the trap for no reason.

49
00:03:14,918 --> 00:03:16,489
I don't think so.

50
00:03:16,489 --> 00:03:20,800
The afterimage just appeared
in a right place at a right time.

51
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,500
It was Visual Deception.

52
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:25,659
Visual Deception?

53
00:03:25,659 --> 00:03:27,932
What the hell is it?

54
00:03:27,932 --> 00:03:30,662
These frames just frightened me.

55
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:36,200
Why was it so weird?

56
00:03:39,745 --> 00:03:41,300
I don't know.

57
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:43,700
Ask Qiao by yourself when he comes back.

58
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:46,200
You don't know it?

59
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,900
You know everything on Glory, don't you?

60
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:53,206
You said that these kids could easily surpass us.

61
00:03:54,729 --> 00:03:57,951
Qiao just did something amazing.

62
00:03:57,951 --> 00:04:00,887
He's invented a new tactic for the Ghost.

63
00:04:01,443 --> 00:04:03,125
Wei,

64
00:04:03,125 --> 00:04:05,525
Rookies can't be underestimated.

65
00:04:29,122 --> 00:04:31,403
The cooling time for his
skill attack will be over.

66
00:04:31,403 --> 00:04:33,293
My last chance.

67
00:04:34,056 --> 00:04:36,081
 

68
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Wait! Xiao has cast the
Mechanical Tracking before dying,

69
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,192
which is dodged by Qiao.

70
00:05:03,192 --> 00:05:05,853
But Xiao's Bounding Mines are triggered.

71
00:05:05,853 --> 00:05:08,843
When did he plant them? Wonderful!
 

72
00:05:08,843 --> 00:05:11,922
This was an awesome game in the Arena Contest.

73
00:05:11,922 --> 00:05:14,009
Jia Shi has eliminated another
opponent. Congratulations.

74
00:05:14,009 --> 00:05:17,699
Meanwhile, Xing Xin finally
erased Jia Shi's best player.

75
00:05:17,699 --> 00:05:20,400
Xiao fought back in despair,

76
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,300
so they both died.

77
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:24,286
But Xiao has eliminated three opponents.

78
00:05:24,286 --> 00:05:27,700
- Long Live Captain Xiao!
- You said you'd be low-keyed.

79
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:31,000
Doesn't matter. It's dark here.

80
00:05:37,103 --> 00:05:41,623
 

81
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,600
Thank you, sir.

82
00:06:04,818 --> 00:06:07,000
Yi Fan has changed a lot.

83
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,900
He used to regard everyone as his teacher,

84
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:12,451
and always asked us for help.

85
00:06:12,451 --> 00:06:15,041
Now he has invented a new tactic,

86
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:17,758
and scored a key point for his team.

87
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:23,600
In Yi Fan's eyes, it can't be more normal.

88
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:28,773
Every game and every tactic
all make him to enjoy Glory.

89
00:06:29,897 --> 00:06:32,670
Xing Xin is really a miraculous team.

90
00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:34,662
I don't think it's miraculous.

91
00:06:34,662 --> 00:06:37,000
Every day, he practices 3 extra hours.

92
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,200
In every hour, he plays 2 extra games.

93
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:42,900
In every game, he tries to use a different tactic.

94
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:44,500
So...

95
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:48,469
Yi Fan is making progress, but we're marking time.

96
00:06:48,469 --> 00:06:49,786
Our captain said...

97
00:06:49,786 --> 00:06:52,826
in eSports, there would
never be a successive winner...

98
00:06:52,826 --> 00:06:54,738
but people who never stop.

99
00:06:54,738 --> 00:06:58,400
Do you mean we should go back to practice?

100
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:02,665
Because of Qiao's extraordinary performance, Xing Xin has eliminated Xiao with 3 players...

101
00:07:02,665 --> 00:07:04,039
- You're great!
- Awesome!

102
00:07:04,039 --> 00:07:06,276
Who will be sent from both sides to next game?

103
00:07:06,276 --> 00:07:11,100
Will Xing Xin show its trump card? We're looking forward to it.

104
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:14,300
Next game will be the match point of
the Arena Contest.

105
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:16,685
Can Xing Xin turn the tide?

106
00:07:16,685 --> 00:07:20,013
The 4th player from Xing Xin is Ye Qiu, former captain of Jia Shi,

107
00:07:20,013 --> 00:07:23,831
and the leader of the first
champion team in Glory's history.

108
00:07:23,831 --> 00:07:26,759
The fateful game is about to begin.

109
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:28,631
- Awesome!
- Captain.

110
00:07:28,631 --> 00:07:32,675
- You can do it!
- Captain! Captain!

111
00:07:32,675 --> 00:07:35,413
- We'll win!
- We'll win!

112
00:07:35,413 --> 00:07:36,956
You can do it...

113
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:40,559
Captain, there is something on your hair.

114
00:07:41,796 --> 00:07:44,000
Let your hair down!

115
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,100
I see, let my hair down.

116
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:48,500
- Come on, Captain.
- You can do it.

117
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:52,100
The player from Jia Shi is...

118
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:53,939
Qiu Fei.

119
00:07:54,595 --> 00:07:57,226
- It's him.
- He may be not well known by everyone here.

120
00:07:57,226 --> 00:08:01,700
Qiu has been promoted from
Jia Shi's second team this season.

121
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:05,000
What's interesting is that
Ye used to be Qiu's teacher.

122
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:10,378
It means this will be a
wonderful teacher-pupil fight.

123
00:08:11,295 --> 00:08:15,477
Captain Yu, do you think
whether Qiu can beat Ye today?

124
00:08:15,477 --> 00:08:19,519
To beat a Freelancer, a Battlemage
has to keep up with his speed.

125
00:08:19,519 --> 00:08:22,304
Freelancer is very quick, but Battlemage...

126
00:08:22,304 --> 00:08:26,052
Ye, I tell you this is the final. You have to do your best to beat your pupil.

127
00:08:26,052 --> 00:08:28,305
If you throw the game today, you'll cry tomorrow.

128
00:08:28,305 --> 00:08:31,648
You have to beat... What?

129
00:08:33,657 --> 00:08:36,363
Your advice may not be heard.

130
00:08:36,363 --> 00:08:38,652
I just want to tell him.

131
00:08:41,089 --> 00:08:43,187
 

132
00:08:55,207 --> 00:08:58,635
Everyone, Ye and Qiu are sitting down.

133
00:08:58,635 --> 00:09:01,436
Their characters enter the
map. The game is kicking off.

134
00:09:01,436 --> 00:09:05,150
Both players are familiar with
each other's style and details.

135
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:07,951
The game would go straight to
the point without probing process.

136
00:09:07,951 --> 00:09:11,403
Ye Qiu, my master.

137
00:09:11,403 --> 00:09:12,871
What are you thinking?

138
00:09:12,871 --> 00:09:15,123
How to defeat you.

139
00:09:15,918 --> 00:09:17,267
Immodest.

140
00:09:17,267 --> 00:09:20,504
Are you overjoyed to your first formal game?

141
00:09:20,504 --> 00:09:24,004
Shall I let you hit me
first? So you won't cry later.

142
00:09:24,004 --> 00:09:26,488
Mr.Ye from Xing Xin,

143
00:09:26,488 --> 00:09:30,329
your rubbish is useless for me.

144
00:09:30,329 --> 00:09:33,184
Still an unpleasant kid.

145
00:09:33,971 --> 00:09:35,629
As Captain Yu expected,

146
00:09:35,629 --> 00:09:39,184
both of them rush directly to
each other without any probing.

147
00:09:39,184 --> 00:09:41,263
Because Jia Shi has 2 more players than Xing Xin,

148
00:09:41,263 --> 00:09:43,048
Ye's task is very arduous.

149
00:09:43,048 --> 00:09:45,533
He has to eliminate as many opponents as he could,

150
00:09:45,533 --> 00:09:48,023
or Xing Xin is likely to lose the Arena Contest.

151
00:09:48,023 --> 00:09:50,135
Shattering Palm-attack. Very fluent.

152
00:09:50,135 --> 00:09:52,117
This is a basic connection between attacks.

153
00:09:52,117 --> 00:09:55,909
But it's not easy to make a
smooth connection like this.

154
00:10:13,416 --> 00:10:16,233
Combat Form is launching Destroying the World,

155
00:10:16,233 --> 00:10:19,858
and has precisely intercepted Ye's attack.

156
00:10:27,262 --> 00:10:29,649
- Good job.
- Awesome.

157
00:10:30,973 --> 00:10:34,592
CF's control over the fight
is beyond our imagination.

158
00:10:34,592 --> 00:10:35,663
He is good at it.

159
00:10:35,663 --> 00:10:38,758
Even the Master of Glory
has no chance to escape now,

160
00:10:38,758 --> 00:10:40,678
and has to wait passively.

161
00:10:40,678 --> 00:10:42,591
19,20,21

162
00:10:42,591 --> 00:10:45,851
Qiu has given Ye 21 successive hits.

163
00:10:55,653 --> 00:10:58,137
Both are attacking. Ye has disappeared.

164
00:10:58,137 --> 00:11:01,238
Without target, Qiu is confused now.

165
00:11:08,718 --> 00:11:12,422
But he is cautious and doesn't move around.

166
00:11:14,892 --> 00:11:17,445
Where will Ye pop out from?

167
00:11:19,606 --> 00:11:20,518
From the ground.

168
00:11:20,518 --> 00:11:23,129
Ninja's Burrowing.

169
00:11:23,129 --> 00:11:25,484
You let me see your weakness
when you were hitting me.

170
00:11:25,484 --> 00:11:28,799
You're not the guy who can erase me with one blow.

171
00:11:32,527 --> 00:11:35,265
- Ye's Dragon Tooth repels Qiu's attack.
- Too slow.

172
00:11:35,265 --> 00:11:38,558
Impossible. With same DT,
why could yours repel me?

173
00:11:38,558 --> 00:11:41,072
Don't blink and take a good look.

174
00:11:44,018 --> 00:11:45,692
Ye's DT strikes Qiao again.

175
00:11:45,692 --> 00:11:47,715
Attacks are broken. Connect again.

176
00:11:47,715 --> 00:11:49,810
Ye has controlled the fight completely.

177
00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:52,452
Now it becomes the skill show of Freelancer.

178
00:11:52,452 --> 00:11:54,507
In the air, Qiu can't escape.

179
00:11:54,507 --> 00:11:58,601
Ye's Umbrella transforming
and skill attacking are perfect.

180
00:11:58,601 --> 00:12:00,385
 

181
00:12:03,609 --> 00:12:05,409
At the middle of the DT attack,

182
00:12:05,409 --> 00:12:07,828
he cancels the skill and casts it again.

183
00:12:07,828 --> 00:12:10,685
The DT launched later strikes its target first.

184
00:12:10,685 --> 00:12:12,875
Now, do you understand it?

185
00:12:12,875 --> 00:12:14,287
20, 21...

186
00:12:14,287 --> 00:12:17,191
The attacks are going on. 26, the last strike.

187
00:12:17,191 --> 00:12:20,167
With 26 successive attacks, Ye has erased CF.

188
00:12:20,167 --> 00:12:22,873
Congratulations to Ye. He has won the game.

189
00:12:22,873 --> 00:12:24,230
Xing Xin has won another match.

190
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:28,403
Now it's 4:6 and Jia Shi
is ahead for the time being.

191
00:12:35,838 --> 00:12:36,766
If you love Glory,

192
00:12:36,766 --> 00:12:37,750
 

193
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:40,591
love everything it brings you.

194
00:12:40,591 --> 00:12:44,922
Whether it's pain, difficulty or sadness.

195
00:12:46,154 --> 00:12:48,669
I can't be responsible for your life,

196
00:12:48,669 --> 00:12:49,708
but I'd like to be...

197
00:12:49,708 --> 00:12:50,296
 
 

198
00:12:50,296 --> 00:12:51,455
one of your choices.
 

199
00:12:51,455 --> 00:12:53,192
 

200
00:12:53,192 --> 00:12:55,803
Because our glory lies...

201
00:12:55,803 --> 00:12:57,809
where our swords are pointing.

202
00:13:03,299 --> 00:13:04,108
Thank you.
 

203
00:13:04,108 --> 00:13:05,646
 

204
00:13:21,746 --> 00:13:23,371
Good boy.

205
00:13:28,495 --> 00:13:30,961
Nothing to tell me?

206
00:13:33,852 --> 00:13:35,580
It's your turn.

207
00:13:36,352 --> 00:13:38,780
What did you tell Su Mu Cheng just now?

208
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:41,208
Come on, you have to go.

209
00:13:41,208 --> 00:13:43,636
Are you afraid you'll be defeated?

210
00:13:43,636 --> 00:13:45,215
I'm not you!

211
00:13:45,215 --> 00:13:48,659
You were beaten by Ye and
decreased half of his Hit Points.

212
00:13:48,659 --> 00:13:51,920
It's not honorable for me to defeat half of him.

213
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:55,634
But can you defeat half of him?

214
00:13:55,634 --> 00:13:58,086
You'll see how I eliminate your teacher.

215
00:13:58,086 --> 00:14:01,506
The 3rd player from Jia Shi is Captain Sun Xiang.

216
00:14:01,506 --> 00:14:04,680
This is the first duel between
two captains of Jia Shi.

217
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:08,156
The fight between the old and
new master could be much fiercer.

218
00:14:08,156 --> 00:14:11,465
Who will win? Let's wait and see.

219
00:14:11,465 --> 00:14:12,886
In the 5th game,
 

220
00:14:12,886 --> 00:14:18,211
Sun, Jia Shi's Captain, will
fight against Ye, Xing Xin's leader.

221
00:14:18,211 --> 00:14:20,853
This is a fight between the new and old captains.

222
00:14:20,853 --> 00:14:22,401
The character, Leaf of Autumn,

223
00:14:22,401 --> 00:14:24,553
which used to be played by Ye for years,

224
00:14:24,553 --> 00:14:27,471
now is played by Sun, is the opponent of Ye today.

225
00:14:27,471 --> 00:14:29,740
I don't know how Mr. Ye's feeling now.

226
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:33,177
To fight against his former closest comrade,

227
00:14:33,177 --> 00:14:34,954
what will he do?

228
00:14:34,954 --> 00:14:36,454
We needn't probe each other.

229
00:14:36,454 --> 00:14:39,454
Let's fight directly in the square.

230
00:14:39,454 --> 00:14:41,541
A fight without a trick?

231
00:14:41,541 --> 00:14:42,580
Okay.

232
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:44,437
Let's fight directly.

233
00:14:44,437 --> 00:14:45,802
The game begins.

234
00:14:45,802 --> 00:14:47,358
Without any tactical movement,

235
00:14:47,358 --> 00:14:49,459
Sun is rushing to the center of the map.

236
00:14:49,459 --> 00:14:52,609
Fighting against Ye Qiu
using LOA in formal contest,

237
00:14:52,609 --> 00:14:54,997
is likely something he has been yearning.

238
00:14:54,997 --> 00:14:57,235
- But Ye is approaching in a roundabout way.
- Where are you?

239
00:14:57,235 --> 00:14:59,592
No rush. I want to increase my HP.

240
00:14:59,592 --> 00:15:01,846
Now, Ye's HP is lower,

241
00:15:01,846 --> 00:15:05,330
so he doesn't want to fight fiercely at first.

242
00:15:05,330 --> 00:15:10,346
What is it? Is Ye Qiu healing himself?

243
00:15:10,346 --> 00:15:12,115
Increasing his HP before the duel,

244
00:15:12,115 --> 00:15:15,145
Ye has gone too far.

245
00:15:16,019 --> 00:15:17,003
Sorry.

246
00:15:17,003 --> 00:15:19,225
Freelancer only has the ability to heal himself.

247
00:15:19,225 --> 00:15:20,907
Can I take some time to do it?

248
00:15:20,907 --> 00:15:22,564
I'll wait for you.

249
00:15:26,422 --> 00:15:28,953
Cooling time will be longer
because my skill level is lower.

250
00:15:28,953 --> 00:15:30,849
Then I have to tell you,

251
00:15:30,849 --> 00:15:32,658
how can you fight against me...

252
00:15:32,658 --> 00:15:35,166
if you use all your Mana Points to heal?

253
00:15:35,166 --> 00:15:36,846
Ordinary chopping?

254
00:15:39,570 --> 00:15:41,466
You're right.

255
00:15:41,466 --> 00:15:43,608
I've got only half MP.

256
00:15:43,608 --> 00:15:45,750
Increase it.

257
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:48,123
Is Ye increasing his MP? That's over the line.

258
00:15:48,123 --> 00:15:50,940
- Nobody will stop him?
- What is Sun doing?

259
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:54,296
- Why isn't he attacking?
- Attack him.

260
00:15:54,296 --> 00:15:59,406
The captain is a real freelancer.

261
00:15:59,406 --> 00:16:01,166
Brilliant tactic.

262
00:16:02,183 --> 00:16:04,816
Unusual.

263
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:09,081
Shameless.

264
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:13,566
He deserves to be called Master.

265
00:16:13,566 --> 00:16:18,296
Come on, Jia Shi! Come on, Jia Shi...

266
00:16:18,296 --> 00:16:20,581
Now!

267
00:16:20,581 --> 00:16:25,018
Long live Xing Xin! Long live Xing Xin!

268
00:16:25,018 --> 00:16:27,468
Okay, let's begin.

269
00:16:28,128 --> 00:16:31,183
Is 70% enough for you?

270
00:16:31,183 --> 00:16:34,476
It's not appropriate to keep
you waiting for a long time.

271
00:16:34,476 --> 00:16:37,864
In addition, 70% is enough to beat you.

272
00:16:37,864 --> 00:16:40,784
I can't beat you embarrassingly easily.

273
00:16:40,784 --> 00:16:43,353
That's what I want to tell you.

274
00:16:44,553 --> 00:16:47,495
Are you giving me a sneak attack?

275
00:17:05,874 --> 00:17:07,390
Dragon out of Sea misses hitting Ye.

276
00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:09,573
Sun launches a lethal attack,

277
00:17:09,573 --> 00:17:13,238
but unfortunately, it is dodged by Ye.

278
00:17:13,238 --> 00:17:17,689
Only Ye Qiu can dodge the
attack with his precise Z-movement.

279
00:17:18,341 --> 00:17:19,515
Chaser attack?

280
00:17:19,515 --> 00:17:22,832
These Chaser attacks are
not lethal. They're useless.

281
00:17:22,832 --> 00:17:25,078
It's Sun's tactic.

282
00:17:25,078 --> 00:17:27,792
He didn't mean to show off his lethal skill, DOOS.

283
00:17:27,792 --> 00:17:30,666
He wanted to cover the tracks
of Chaser with the wave effect,

284
00:17:30,666 --> 00:17:33,116
so our captain can't dodge his attack.

285
00:17:33,713 --> 00:17:36,681
Using the lethal skill as a
cover, attack with an ordinary one.

286
00:17:36,681 --> 00:17:38,514
He's really getting smarter.

287
00:17:38,514 --> 00:17:41,149
After a round of attacks,
nobody can get the upper hand.

288
00:17:41,149 --> 00:17:42,474
Another close combat.

289
00:17:42,474 --> 00:17:45,022
Debris has triggered Landslide
and its attack range is extended.

290
00:17:45,022 --> 00:17:45,903
Ye is hit.

291
00:17:45,903 --> 00:17:48,776
It seems that Ye is still a bit strange to LOA,

292
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:50,458
which is level 75 now.

293
00:17:50,458 --> 00:17:54,011
I wonder how much advantage
Sun can take from here.

294
00:17:55,196 --> 00:17:57,591
You'll feel worse.

295
00:18:13,724 --> 00:18:16,025
The speed of Sun's spear
has been greatly improved...

296
00:18:16,025 --> 00:18:17,683
when the weapon reaches level 75.

297
00:18:17,683 --> 00:18:19,073
LOA's attacking speed...

298
00:18:19,073 --> 00:18:22,222
now can catch up with
the skill speed of Freelance,

299
00:18:22,222 --> 00:18:24,047
It seems, besides the character's promotion,

300
00:18:24,047 --> 00:18:25,269
Sun has become stronger.

301
00:18:25,269 --> 00:18:27,023
The speed of the fight is getting faster.

302
00:18:27,023 --> 00:18:31,061
This is actually an Action per Minute contest.

303
00:18:46,438 --> 00:18:50,009
Attacking and defending, their
APMs become faster and faster.

304
00:18:50,009 --> 00:18:52,991
Have they reached their peak values of APM?

305
00:18:54,015 --> 00:18:56,094
Our captain's APM is so fast.

306
00:18:56,094 --> 00:18:57,625
Ye has no lethal skill now.

307
00:18:57,625 --> 00:18:59,626
Captain shouldn't give up his advantage...

308
00:18:59,626 --> 00:19:01,783
and contest APM with the Freelancer.

309
00:19:01,783 --> 00:19:04,098
He is not acting on impulse.

310
00:19:05,767 --> 00:19:08,481
He believes he can beat Ye in this way.

311
00:19:08,481 --> 00:19:10,758
He's just carrying out his tactic.

312
00:19:10,758 --> 00:19:14,607
Once the APM reaches the
peak value, you'll become slower.

313
00:19:14,607 --> 00:19:18,884
If he plays too fast now, how
could he cope with the next game?

314
00:19:18,884 --> 00:19:21,437
What if he hasn't peaked yet?

315
00:19:24,495 --> 00:19:27,613
- Hasn't peaked yet?
- You don't know...

316
00:19:27,613 --> 00:19:31,913
how much effort Sun has put
into preparing for this game?

317
00:19:36,794 --> 00:19:39,149
Shattering Palm-attack. Ye is hit.

318
00:19:40,095 --> 00:19:40,904
What problem?

319
00:19:40,904 --> 00:19:45,070
It was obvious Ye could dodge
the Palm-attack. Why did he fail?

320
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:48,625
He could have dodged it, but he didn't expect it.

321
00:19:48,625 --> 00:19:52,648
Jia Shi has upgraded the
equipment of LOA for the final game.

322
00:19:52,648 --> 00:19:57,179
His striking range, speed, attack
and defense are all improved.

323
00:19:57,179 --> 00:20:02,979
That means Ye in fact doesn't
know the present LOA at all.

324
00:20:03,566 --> 00:20:05,645
It's very unfortunate for Ye.

325
00:20:05,645 --> 00:20:08,835
Sir, why are you so weak now?

326
00:20:08,835 --> 00:20:12,777
In this way, how can you
beat me embarrassingly easily?

327
00:20:13,819 --> 00:20:16,249
LOA has been attacking Ye Qiu,

328
00:20:16,249 --> 00:20:20,003
who seems to be a little
overwhelmed by his opponent's attack.

329
00:20:20,003 --> 00:20:22,028
In this way, Ye will lose the game.

330
00:20:22,028 --> 00:20:23,766
Now Ye's HP is very low,

331
00:20:23,766 --> 00:20:25,861
and he can't make any counterattack.

332
00:20:25,861 --> 00:20:27,922
Ye is in danger.

333
00:20:33,546 --> 00:20:35,665
Just like a non-player character,

334
00:20:35,665 --> 00:20:38,950
you should trigger Escaping
when your HP decreases to 10%.

335
00:20:38,950 --> 00:20:40,315
Bleeding Escaping?

336
00:20:40,315 --> 00:20:42,067
Good idea.

337
00:20:51,202 --> 00:20:54,470
It's a golden opportunity, I can't let you down.

338
00:21:00,066 --> 00:21:03,407
Gatling Gun is shooting and forcing Sun to dodge.

339
00:21:03,407 --> 00:21:05,692
Dodging the shooting, Sun
tries to approach Ye's back.

340
00:21:05,692 --> 00:21:08,707
Unfortunately, he is hit by a flying shuriken.

341
00:21:08,707 --> 00:21:10,692
When did Ye throw the shuriken?

342
00:21:10,692 --> 00:21:12,136
A flying shuriken.

343
00:21:12,136 --> 00:21:14,476
Why didn't I just notice it?

344
00:21:30,195 --> 00:21:31,282
My God!

345
00:21:31,282 --> 00:21:35,075
What happened? Ye has turned the tables.

346
00:21:35,075 --> 00:21:37,535
Your new equipment made a lot of troubles for me.

347
00:21:37,535 --> 00:21:41,461
But a trouble doesn't mean it
must be a bad thing, does it?

348
00:21:42,550 --> 00:21:44,581
Your moving speed has increased by 3.

349
00:21:44,581 --> 00:21:47,541
Attack range has increased by 5.

350
00:21:47,541 --> 00:21:50,485
Physical resistance has increased by about 200.

351
00:21:50,485 --> 00:21:53,491
Stiffness time has decreased by 0.01 sec.

352
00:21:54,815 --> 00:21:58,664
Pretending to be weak, you're
just looking for my weakness.

353
00:21:58,664 --> 00:22:00,656
I take back what I said.

354
00:22:00,656 --> 00:22:03,362
It's really difficult to beat you, Sun Xiang.

355
00:22:03,362 --> 00:22:05,115
But, from now on,

356
00:22:05,115 --> 00:22:07,184
you'll have no chance.

357
00:22:32,534 --> 00:22:36,191
Wonderful! it's a fight between gods.

358
00:23:11,430 --> 00:23:15,341
Sun is launching Dragon
Soaring, a decisive attack.

359
00:23:15,341 --> 00:23:18,720
Ye has dodged it. Will the dragon's head raise?

360
00:23:21,545 --> 00:23:23,267
Its head is turning!

361
00:23:23,267 --> 00:23:26,331
Ye has been hit by the new attack
from DS, Dragon Head Turning.

362
00:23:26,331 --> 00:23:28,393
Jia Shi is really a top team.

363
00:23:28,393 --> 00:23:32,614
It represents the highest
level of Battlemage in Glory.

364
00:23:32,614 --> 00:23:35,096
Captain, well done!

365
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:37,693
Game over.

366
00:23:37,693 --> 00:23:40,651
Sun Xiang seized the last chance to...

367
00:23:42,296 --> 00:23:45,191
 

368
00:23:49,888 --> 00:23:53,015
- Come on!
- Come on!

369
00:23:53,015 --> 00:23:53,965
Ye Xiu.

370
00:23:53,965 --> 00:23:56,926
What? The winner is Ye Qiu!

371
00:23:56,926 --> 00:23:58,251
It's Ye who has finally won.

372
00:23:58,251 --> 00:24:01,370
The result of the game was entirely unexpected.

373
00:24:01,370 --> 00:24:04,052
Let's take a look at what happened.

374
00:24:04,052 --> 00:24:08,369
Using the grabbing function of
DS, Ye conveyed himself to Sun,

375
00:24:08,369 --> 00:24:11,408
and gave Sun a Sky-strike when
he was in the time of stiffness.

376
00:24:11,408 --> 00:24:14,558
To be precise, just using
his Blocking below level 20,

377
00:24:14,558 --> 00:24:17,248
Ye took back his 0.03% HP.

378
00:24:17,248 --> 00:24:21,073
With this 0.03% HP, he won the game.

379
00:24:21,073 --> 00:24:23,414
It's really incredible.

380
00:24:23,414 --> 00:24:25,342
It's really a wonderful game.

381
00:24:25,342 --> 00:24:29,580
The 0.03% HP has determined
the result of the game.

382
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:34,340
I declare that the winner of the game is Ye Qiu.

383
00:24:35,443 --> 00:24:38,116
- Master!
- Awesome!

384
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:46,640
Keep training, and keep
breaking through your own limits.

385
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:51,297
Sun Xiang has become a real master now.

386
00:25:01,321 --> 00:25:04,209
This time, I'm not only gonna beat Ye Qiu,

387
00:25:04,209 --> 00:25:08,405
but tell everyone that I'm not relying on LOA.

388
00:25:09,804 --> 00:25:12,375
Even if we're on the same starting line,

389
00:25:12,375 --> 00:25:15,182
I'll finally win.

390
00:25:29,315 --> 00:25:37,315
Jia Shi will win! Jia Shi will win!

391
00:26:00,051 --> 00:26:02,184
I said you shouldn't be too proud.

392
00:26:03,066 --> 00:26:05,112
Now LOA has lost to him.

393
00:26:07,036 --> 00:26:09,345
Not LOA.

394
00:26:09,345 --> 00:26:11,184
I've lost to him.

395
00:26:13,908 --> 00:26:16,384
Today, I've realized...

396
00:26:16,384 --> 00:26:18,788
I can't be made great by a character,

397
00:26:18,788 --> 00:26:21,748
Instead, I should make the character great.

398
00:26:21,748 --> 00:26:23,786
He's really awesome.

399
00:26:24,525 --> 00:26:26,301
Of course.

400
00:26:26,985 --> 00:26:28,586
Someday,

401
00:26:31,556 --> 00:26:33,411
let's beat him.

402
00:26:36,597 --> 00:26:39,747
Ye, why are you leaving?
You've still got 0.03% HP.

403
00:26:39,747 --> 00:26:41,937
Increase it. Anyway, you're shameless,
 

404
00:26:41,937 --> 00:26:43,762
just do it again.

405
00:26:43,762 --> 00:26:46,531
Or does it mean you want to
give your rookies a chance?

406
00:26:46,531 --> 00:26:47,507
Good job, Captain.

407
00:26:47,507 --> 00:26:51,086
Because of his HP, Ye has given up the next game.

408
00:26:51,086 --> 00:26:54,054
His substitute is Wei Chen, a newcomer.

409
00:26:54,054 --> 00:26:55,839
Captain Wei!

410
00:26:55,839 --> 00:26:59,933
He can't be called a newcomer.
He's about over thirty, isn't he?

411
00:26:59,933 --> 00:27:02,296
You were heard, bastard.

412
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:05,233
A newcomer doesn't mean a young guy.

413
00:27:05,233 --> 00:27:09,342
And as far as the game is
concerned, it's really new for you.

414
00:27:10,966 --> 00:27:13,361
Cut your crap!

415
00:27:15,685 --> 00:27:18,050
Now, give it up for Shen Jian from Jia Shi.

416
00:27:18,050 --> 00:27:20,446
- Come on!
- Okay.

417
00:27:20,446 --> 00:27:28,095
Shen Jian! Shen Jian!

418
00:27:30,019 --> 00:27:31,907
Warm up?

419
00:27:31,907 --> 00:27:33,883
For beating him?

420
00:27:33,883 --> 00:27:36,095
I needn't warm up.

421
00:27:36,883 --> 00:27:39,500
I'll beat him. I promise.

422
00:27:40,748 --> 00:27:42,555
ASAP.

423
00:27:44,088 --> 00:27:45,437
In the 6th game,

424
00:27:45,437 --> 00:27:47,596
the last player from Xing Xin is Wei Chen,

425
00:27:47,596 --> 00:27:48,984
the Warlock Windward Formation.

426
00:27:48,984 --> 00:27:51,317
The player from Jia Shi is Shen Jian,

427
00:27:51,317 --> 00:27:52,753
the Striker Successive Strikes,

428
00:27:52,753 --> 00:27:56,229
Will the veteran Wei beat
two players and turn the tables?

429
00:27:56,229 --> 00:27:57,498
Let's wait and see.

430
00:27:57,498 --> 00:28:00,664
Both characters have entered
the map. The game begins.

431
00:28:00,664 --> 00:28:04,949
For a Warlock, controlling and
using the shooting distance...

432
00:28:04,949 --> 00:28:06,892
is key to fight against a Striker.

433
00:28:06,892 --> 00:28:09,416
Captain Wei knows Warlock inside out.

434
00:28:09,416 --> 00:28:12,257
For a Striker, only by finding a
chance to attack at close range,

435
00:28:12,257 --> 00:28:13,717
can he defeat the warlock.

436
00:28:13,717 --> 00:28:16,669
As expected, SS is rushing toward WF at first.

437
00:28:16,669 --> 00:28:19,002
WF uses Magic Missile to interrupt him.

438
00:28:19,002 --> 00:28:20,240
SS is approaching.

439
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:23,216
Jumping back quickly, WF
locks him with Six-light Prison.

440
00:28:23,216 --> 00:28:24,740
SS's HP is decreasing dramatically.

441
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:27,875
Though Wei is older, his attack is precise.

442
00:28:27,875 --> 00:28:31,017
We all know the veteran Wei
is good at draining his opponent.

443
00:28:31,017 --> 00:28:34,467
But in this game, he is fighting quickly.

444
00:28:52,821 --> 00:28:54,192
Bao Zi.

445
00:28:58,316 --> 00:29:00,316
What happened...

446
00:29:00,316 --> 00:29:01,941
with Wei's hand?

447
00:29:03,965 --> 00:29:06,052
Hand? Nothing happened.

448
00:29:06,052 --> 00:29:10,058
Look, his Light-prison was cast
precisely and securely, right?

449
00:29:16,213 --> 00:29:19,539
Though his HP is low, SS is fighting aggressively.

450
00:29:19,539 --> 00:29:22,531
He's looking for the chance to decrease WF's HP.

451
00:29:22,531 --> 00:29:25,237
Approaching again. WF defends with Magic Mirror.

452
00:29:25,237 --> 00:29:28,617
SS's High Kicking has hit WF again.

453
00:29:28,617 --> 00:29:31,267
With little HP, SS is still rushing.

454
00:29:31,267 --> 00:29:33,100
WF's Magic Missile. Good.

455
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:35,511
SS is dead.

456
00:29:36,932 --> 00:29:39,035
 

457
00:29:39,035 --> 00:29:40,471
Xing Xin has won another game.

458
00:29:40,471 --> 00:29:41,947
The veteran Wei is still powerful.

459
00:29:41,947 --> 00:29:44,796
He has scored two points cleanly for Xing Xin.

460
00:29:44,796 --> 00:29:47,581
See? He has won, hasn't he?

461
00:29:47,581 --> 00:29:50,263
Nothing is wrong with Captain Wei's hand.

462
00:29:50,263 --> 00:29:53,262
He can even beat three opponents. Trust him.

463
00:29:53,262 --> 00:29:56,499
I have to admire Captain Wei for his ability.

464
00:29:56,499 --> 00:29:58,554
Still powerful.

465
00:29:58,554 --> 00:29:59,975
Facing the healthy opponents,

466
00:29:59,975 --> 00:30:03,459
can he beat two of them and
narrow the scoring gap with Jia Shi?

467
00:30:03,459 --> 00:30:05,570
Let Wei abandon it.

468
00:30:05,570 --> 00:30:08,512
Why? He has won.

469
00:30:09,308 --> 00:30:12,117
How important are the hands of a player?

470
00:30:12,117 --> 00:30:13,680
You should know it.

471
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:19,312
If he doesn't stop now,
his entire career could be ruined.

472
00:30:31,574 --> 00:30:33,105
Okay.

473
00:30:33,105 --> 00:30:35,509
You're right.

474
00:30:35,509 --> 00:30:37,175
Captain Wei...

475
00:30:37,175 --> 00:30:39,736
His hand is still injured.

476
00:30:51,537 --> 00:30:57,552
Wei's hand has never been completely healed
since it was hurt when fighting against Zhu Xian.

477
00:30:57,552 --> 00:31:01,742
The doctor said he had to rest
for a period before competing.

478
00:31:01,742 --> 00:31:04,297
Ignoring it, Wei was injected
with anesthetic before the game,

479
00:31:04,297 --> 00:31:06,144
and told me to shut up.

480
00:31:07,464 --> 00:31:10,995
Captain Wei said that Xing Xin needed his help.

481
00:31:10,995 --> 00:31:14,906
So he had to compete in the game
and had to win it.

482
00:31:15,614 --> 00:31:17,090
Because...

483
00:31:17,090 --> 00:31:21,318
it could probably be his last game.

484
00:31:22,145 --> 00:31:26,263
Either living with a regret
or making a last attempt,

485
00:31:26,263 --> 00:31:31,419
he has actually made the choice
since the day he joined Xing Xin.

486
00:31:37,064 --> 00:31:39,095
Wei.

487
00:31:39,095 --> 00:31:43,967
Until we take the championship,
there'll be no last game.

488
00:31:43,967 --> 00:31:47,736
In the last Arena game,
the player from Jia Shi is Su Mu Cheng.

489
00:31:47,736 --> 00:31:51,061
The best Launcher in League vs. the first Master.

490
00:31:51,061 --> 00:31:53,822
That'll be a fight between magic and gunpowder.

491
00:31:53,822 --> 00:31:59,375
Who will win the Arena
Contest? This game will tell us.

492
00:32:00,171 --> 00:32:04,258
Just a provisional tactical change. It's normal.

493
00:32:04,258 --> 00:32:06,439
Don't be too surprised.

494
00:32:08,138 --> 00:32:12,582
Wearing Jia Shi's uniform
and sitting in its bench,

495
00:32:12,582 --> 00:32:17,913
it means you're ready to do your best for Jia Shi.

496
00:32:27,037 --> 00:32:28,844
Relax.

497
00:32:35,587 --> 00:32:36,825
Mr.Tao.

498
00:32:36,825 --> 00:32:39,404
You're putting Mu Cheng in a dilemma.

499
00:32:39,404 --> 00:32:42,356
You can't send her in the last and sensitive game.

500
00:32:42,356 --> 00:32:46,895
She would be suspected of having thrown the game
even if she hasn't.

501
00:32:46,895 --> 00:32:51,710
If she doesn't want to be suspected,
she'll do her best.

502
00:32:53,053 --> 00:32:54,235
But in the competition,

503
00:32:54,235 --> 00:33:00,686
any mistake you make would be interpreted
as throwing the game.

504
00:33:02,473 --> 00:33:04,800
She has only one choice:

505
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:06,766
she has to win.

506
00:33:06,766 --> 00:33:09,240
Isn't it exactly what we want?
