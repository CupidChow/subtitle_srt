 "Light From the Ashes" - Cai Wei Ze 

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:06,220
♫  Countless fireflies born from insignificance  ♫

3
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:10,090
♫  Riding the long wind to gather into a shining galaxy  ♫

4
00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:14,010
♫  Proclaim to the world on top of the sky  ♫

5
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:18,990
♫  We will return in glory  ♫

6
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:23,770
♫  Clear the clouds and descend with the heat  ♫

7
00:00:23,770 --> 00:00:27,430
♫  Melting ice and snow, overcoming twists and turns  ♫

8
00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:31,290
♫  Finally at this moment of peak  ♫

9
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:35,340
♫  There is a figure that coincides with the past  ♫

10
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:39,160
♫  The glory of the past that never came  ♫

11
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:42,750
♫  The pride that the future will never pass  ♫

12
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:46,580
♫  Our fingertips intertwined and condensed  ♫

13
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:50,400
♫  Into a song that ignited the battlefield  ♫

14
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:54,260
♫  The only light in an endless night  ♫

15
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:58,050
♫  Is you and me who overcame mediocrity  ♫

16
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:02,010
♫  Up on the clouds and down in the dust  ♫

17
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:05,770
♫  Fireflies making every effort to illuminate  ♫

18
00:01:05,770 --> 00:01:09,720
♫  I came from the legend to carry on a legend  ♫

19
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:13,470
♫  Once it's disruptive, a decade of persistence won't be in vain  ♫

20
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:17,430
♫  Up on the clouds and down in the dust  ♫

21
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:21,190
♫  Fireflies making every effort to illuminate  ♫

22
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:24,840
♫  Fireflies making every effort to illuminate  ♫

23
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:28,100
   

24
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:32,680
   

25
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:41,160
You're using my scarf as a rag?

26
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:46,600
A ragged, patched cloth? It should be recycled.

27
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,040
- Isn't that the right one? 
 - You really make me mad!

28
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:50,480
This scarf is very expensive!

29
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:52,560
Where's the other half?

30
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:58,600
What have you even done for this internet cafe?

31
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:01,920
You couldn't change a bulb! You had to be taught how to be a cashier!

32
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,420
You make me so mad! You are really use-

33
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:06,240
-less.

34
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:11,640
 To keep a person from leaving, first you have to capture his heart. 

35
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,900
 How do I capture his heart? 

36
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:15,700
 Two words. 

37
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:17,780
 Spoil him. 

38
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:25,200

00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,600
Use... ful!

40
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:30,820
Superman!

41
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,040
Master!

42
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,780
Master, having you in my Happy Internet Cafe

43
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:40,500
is a blessing derived from my previous eight lives!

44
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:47,460
Sorry for my bad temper. This scarf, I don't need it anymore!

45
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:49,640
I'll buy another one next time.

46
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:52,620
During Spring Festival, we shouldn't be fighting each other.

47
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:54,780
Right, Master?

48
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:57,920
- Are you comfortable? 
 - So I'll continue.

49
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,700
What?

50
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:06,680
You shouldn't be doing this kind of dirty work, such menial work.

51
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,500
I'll do it!

52
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:11,060
Boss, leave the dirty work to me.

53
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:13,360
Let me do it!

54
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,481
- We shouldn't be fighting each other. 
 - Just let me do it!

55
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:19,700
Okay, here. Here.

56
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,860
Take this bank card.

57
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,600
Go buy a new set of clothing.

58
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:29,800
Wearing new clothes will bring you the best luck in the new year!

59
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:32,400
It fell. Let me pick it up for you. Take it.

60
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,100
Go, go.

61
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:43,200
I'm not short of clothes. Please use it to buy a scarf.

62
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,100
Stop there!

63
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:54,240
Go buy a new outfit, please.

64
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,320
You always switch back and forth between a few different outfits. I'm so sick of it.

65
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:58,700
Take it! This is an order.

66
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:00,780
- Boss... 
 - Just go. Shh, shh.

67
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:02,440
Go, go.

68
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:04,600
Go, go.

69
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,800
Guo Guo, Happy New Year!

70
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:23,080
 Xiao Tang, Happy New Year! 

71
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:25,340
 You don't look happy though. What happened? 

72
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:29,100
 Did Ye Xiu make you angry again? 

73
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:31,920
So you can tell?

74
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:37,150
A few minutes ago, I couldn't reign in my temper

75
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:39,000
and said some hurtful things to him.

76
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,900
As a result, up to now he has not come back.

77
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:46,700
Xiao Tang, do you think that he would leave for good?

78
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:48,700
 Normal people would probably do that. 

79
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:51,660
 But when it comes to him... I don't think so. 

80
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:53,300
 Masters are always so unpredictable. 

81
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:56,020
 The more out of line his behavior is, the more like a master he seems. 

82
00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:00,600
So I shouldn't get mad under any circumstances and tolerate whatever he does.

83
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:29,700
   

84
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,940
So you're back?

85
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:51,540
You even got your hair done!

86
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:54,201
Don't be shy. There's no one else here.

87
00:05:54,201 --> 00:05:55,900
Ye Xiu!

88
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:13,960
What brand of suit are you wearing?

89
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:24,700
This wouldn't be that Italian handmade clothing brand by any chance?

90
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:33,080
I've only had the courage to go window shopping there.

91
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:35,800
But you just bought it and wore it home.

92
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:39,500
Considering my net worth, wasn't it only fair that I spent so much money?

93
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:43,760
You are really driving me nuts!

94
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:53,140
Don't get mad at him under any circumstances and tolerate his every action.

95
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:58,200
Never mind.

96
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:05,320
You should wear this style more often.

97
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:07,920
It makes you look really dignified.

98
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:14,180
Well, that light bulb went out!

99
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:16,200
Please fix it!

100
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:28,020
   

101
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,400
Master...

102
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:34,580
I'm sorry, Master.

103
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:36,560
Do you want to change clothes first?

104
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,987
Such expensive clothes are really difficult to clean when they get dirty.

105
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:46,090
But, these are mere worldly possessions.  Please continue. Please continue.

106
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:47,900
It doesn't matter.

107
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,000
Awesome! Awesome!

108
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,500
Sure enough, changing clothes made you into a different person.

109
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:55,180
Totally different from who you used to be!

110
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,900
Who I used to be?

111
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:00,900
Yes! When you first came here, you couldn't do this, couldn't do that.

112
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:03,000
You even had to look up instructions for changing a light bulb.

113
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,280
Customers made complaints against you three times day,

114
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,760
more punctual than having three meals a day.

115
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:23,240
Master, I didn't mean to disrespect you.

116
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:25,760
I was actually complimenting you!

117
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:32,720
It seems that I got too much.

118
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:35,940
Maybe I should ask for help.

119
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:42,880
Miss, our store provides home delivery services within five kilometers.

120
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,821
- Really? 
 - Of course!

121
00:08:44,821 --> 00:08:47,700
- Please help me! Thank you! 
 - Okay!

122
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:52,000
Mucheng! Something terrible has happened.

123
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,800
What happened? Why are you in such a rush?

124
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:56,100
There's something wrong with Ye Xiu.

125
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:57,540
What's wrong with him?

126
00:08:57,540 --> 00:09:00,120
He went out and bought a suit in the morning.

127
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:03,020
When he came back, he's became a totally different person.

128
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:07,000
He's dressing like a rich guy and speaking in a pretentious manner.

129
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,700
Do you think...

130
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,980
he has a second personality?

131
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:15,400
So even that can happen?

132
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,240
What happened after that?

133
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:19,100
Then...

134
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:21,600
Then he started to drop things!

135
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,700
He just kept...

136
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:27,220
breaking all kinds of things.

137
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:30,080
He kept breaking things!

138
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:35,660
Could he be thinking about flying away now that he's full-fledged?

139
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:40,680
Boss, which of these two types of chocolates do you think is better?

140
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:44,400
They look the same! How could there be any difference?

141
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,300
Even though the packaging looks the same,

142
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:51,140
how do you know which one is liqueur chocolate and which one is nut chocolate?

143
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,000
Forget it.

144
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,410
When we go home and remove the packaging, we'll have the answer.

145
00:09:58,410 --> 00:10:00,200
Boss, let's go!

146
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,580
- Check out, please. 
 - Okay.

147
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:05,900
Maybe I should buy a watermelon for him to drop.

148
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:08,400
Boss, please help me get another coffee.

149
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,800
I don't drink coffee.

150
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:12,640
Even if you don't drink it, there is someone else who will drink it.

151
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:16,480
Alright, let's go!

152
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,920
Still unwilling to give up?

153
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:35,040
Did you bring what I wanted?

154
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,590
You probably didn't bring

155
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:39,560
what I wanted, either.

156
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:54,550
   

157
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:05,400
You should thank me for letting you borrow my stuff.

158
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,740
You didn't abuse Little Dot, did you?

159
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:09,060
He eats better than you, sleeps more than you.

160
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:11,140
When it's time to take him to exercise, rain or shine, I never slack off.

161
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:13,260
When it's time for him to make friends, I post on every platform for him.

162
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:14,860
Comparing the lives of you two,

163
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:19,340
he's been living in heaven while you've been living in hell.

164
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:21,020
The same examples every time.

165
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:22,950
Can you at least be a bit more creative?

166
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:26,960
In a word, when will you come back home?

167
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:35,740
It depends.

168
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:37,500
I'll come see you again when I have time.

169
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:43,050
And exactly when will that be?

170
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:47,560
Give me...at least three years.

171
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:58,840
There you go again.

172
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,040
It's been 10 years since you last came back home.

173
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:02,260
Why don't you try being a little bit nicer to me?

174
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:03,500
I'm your older brother, for goodness sake.

175
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,260
You're only my brother when we're at home.

176
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:11,380
Here, you are just a loser who looks a lot like me.

177
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:27,600
Boss, so you were with Mucheng.

178
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:35,750
He smiled at me!

179
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,660
Look at him!

180
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:42,260
He even changed his clothes!

181
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:44,830
Do you think it means that he has decided not to leave?

182
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,500
Do you have a fever?

183
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:52,560
You're the one with a fever.

184
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:56,090
I don't have a fever.

185
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:01,080
Please talk some sense into him for me.

186
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,360
Look at what he's like now.

187
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:05,030
He wouldn't survive going out in the world alone!

188
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:08,940
If he stays at the Happy Internet Cafe, at least I can take care of him.

189
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:12,060
Come on, give that to me.

190
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:14,330
Go talk to him! Now!

191
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:24,740
That guy's moods are really erratic.

192
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:27,440
One second he's showing a poker face, the next second he's smiling.

193
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:30,041
He's a grown-up. But he still needs me to indulge him.

194
00:13:30,041 --> 00:13:32,400
The man has no conscience!

195
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:35,270
Were you just bad-mouthing me?

196
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:48,250
I wasn't!

197
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:52,180
I really wasn't bad-mouthing you!

198
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:54,760
I have this problem, I've got a stinky mouth.

199
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:57,200
But my heart is still very kind.

200
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,380
For real.

201
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:00,027
I liked it when you were bad-mouthing me!

202
00:14:00,027 --> 00:14:01,800
Do you have more vulgar words?

203
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:05,640
Boss.

204
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:07,260
What are you doing?

205
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:09,970
Boss?

206
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:16,030
Holy cow!

207
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:19,280
What is happening here?

208
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:29,950
It couldn't be...

209
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:32,700
Shadow Clone?

210
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:41,360
Ye Qiu.

211
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,400
As I told you,

212
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:47,010
There would be someone who would drink this cup of coffee.

213
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:57,540
Isn't this twin brothers setting a little over the top?

214
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:01,870
I mean, are you really...

215
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:05,470
Are you really Ye Xiu?

216
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:09,070
I've always been.

217
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:12,640
So the one in the suit is Ye Qiu?

218
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:14,560
He stole my name to pass himself off as me.

219
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,750
Isn't that outrageous?

220
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:22,440
I used to imagine that you must be a kind-hearted girl.

221
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:24,880
But only when I met you did I see

222
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:28,580
that beauty and kindness coexist in you.

223
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:33,580
Tell me, did you come here in another attempt to take him back home?

224
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:35,180
No!

225
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:38,570
I came here to see if my brother needs my help.

226
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:39,740
That's good then.

227
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:42,040
Even if he went on to use the 18 kinds of wushu weapons,

228
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:43,640
trying to tie your or bind you up,

229
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:47,060
you would never leave, right?

230
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:50,580
If he was really that powerful, he wouldn't have needed to wait this long.

231
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:53,720
I know that he must have caused a lot of trouble here.

232
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,660
So I came here to help him deal with it.

233
00:15:56,440 --> 00:16:01,180
Confident as he sounds, he'll be the one who gets dealt with in the end.

234
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:03,540
My brother must have suffered a lot out here.

235
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:04,780
I've been worried about him.

236
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:06,750
My brother hates to stay at home.

237
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:09,400
So he wants me to take his place.

238
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:12,540
I've been taking care of my brother since our childhood.

239
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:15,200
I've been playing tricks on my brother since we were kids.

240
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,620
He tried to ask a girl out in junior high school.

241
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:17,910
Then a few days after the girl agreed to date him,

242
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:19,680
he broke up with her.

243
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:22,500
Then, you know what, I was the one who saved the day!

244
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,200
What are you smiling about?

245
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:29,540
But the way I remember it, it was you who tried to ask the girl out.

246
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:32,440
I pretended to be him and broke up with his girlfriend.

247
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:34,360
His girlfriend couldn't tell me and my brother apart

248
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,860
and agreed in the end.

249
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:39,000
Just for that, my dad rewarded me with a game console.

250
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,600
What else could I do?

251
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:43,300
I could only choose to forgive him!

252
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:45,140
What else could he do other than reconcile with me?

253
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:48,480
He was not as good an actor as me, not as good a fighter as me.

254
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:52,320
Now I just hope that my brother can live a better life.

255
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,560
That way I'll be relieved.

256
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,780
Your brother is doing very well now.

257
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:58,240
Even though he has retired,

258
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:02,280
the cafe owner has been helping your brother build a new team.

259
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:06,050
A new team?

260
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,170
No wonder he doesn't want to go home.

261
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:17,800
I mean, I need to go thank her.

262
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:21,110
Boss, what do we most need for our team?

263
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:24,600
Of course it's this.

264
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:29,690
So prepare to welcome the god of wealth.

265
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:38,040
Hold on.

266
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:42,940
So you're saying that you'd like to invest...

267
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:44,760
Invest in what?

268
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:46,740
Invest in your Happy Internet Cafe.

269
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:48,580
Either acquisition or shareholding...

270
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:50,900
Choose the way you like.

271
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:53,280
Stop kidding me, President Ye!

272
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,860
This is just a tiny, shabby bar counter.

273
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:57,230
Not a negotiating table!

274
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:07,720
Boss, I'm very serious about partnering with you.

275
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:10,360
Look at you!

276
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:12,440
Your president vibes are leaking out again!

277
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:14,080
You... Can't you just contain your vibes

278
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:17,380
and try to fit in with the lives of us common people?

279
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:22,800
President Ye, what's the point of an acquisition?

280
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,620
I don't even have any valuable stuff here.

281
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:26,790
Only 100 plus shabby computers.

282
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,340
Come on, have some water.

283
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:34,700
The intangible assets are of great value though.

284
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:36,720
Intangible assets?

285
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:41,120
Are... Are you talking about me?

286
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,250
As a president, you really have a special way of complimenting people,

287
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:45,950
using all those technical terms.

288
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:50,980
I was talking about your team!

289
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:55,120
When you succeed,

290
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:58,940
the name 'Happy Internet Cafe' will be of immeasurable value.

291
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:02,662
I decided to invest because of the bright future of your internet cafe,

292
00:19:02,662 --> 00:19:05,520
not because of the 100 computers!

293
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:08,740
Boss Chen.

294
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,780
Are you really going to invest?

295
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:15,110
Of course.

296
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:19,740
But before we make the deal,

297
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:23,240
you have to promise me one small thing.

298
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:28,120
You are about to be my shareholder,

299
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:31,160
there's nothing we can't talk about. Please go ahead.

300
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:34,500
It's about my brother.

301
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:36,250
Can you let go of him?

302
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:39,250
Let go of him?

303
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:46,380
Are you asking me to fire your brother?

304
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:51,080
This... This is a bit too much...

305
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:54,480
I'll see what I can do to give you any compensation you want.

306
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:57,380
I don't want a huge amount of compensation.

307
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:03,980
It's just that you know your brother has rotten hands.

308
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:06,920
They break everything they touch.

309
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:10,360
I'm telling you, in the few months since he came in here,

310
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:12,340
the value of the things he broke could almost catch up with

311
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:14,780
the profits of the cafe for half a year.

312
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:17,120
Okay, give me a price.

313
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,110
I'll pay exactly that amount.

314
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:23,890
I can't let you do that!

315
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:30,020
Is this amount enough?

316
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:33,850
   

317
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:40,400
Enough. More than enough!

318
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,460
You're being too generous.

319
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:45,200
Are you really that desperate to take your brother back home?

320
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:48,660
This time, I'm acting under my dad's orders.

321
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:52,340
So I really can't go home empty-handed.

322
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:57,920
I understand how you've been feeling.

323
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:04,000
But there is something you may not understand.

324
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:11,680
Your brother has become kind of like a legend in Glory.

325
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:14,800
To say that he's able to rally multitudes with one call would not be an overstatement.

326
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:17,520
Every one in the guild is his fan,

327
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:21,960
including the several super rich guys who have been fighting to hire him.

328
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:26,880
So, President Ye,

329
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:32,490
it's not enough just to win me over.

330
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:39,040
You need to find a way to disband the guild.

331
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:46,080
Forget it, forget it.

332
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:50,830
It's not really my place to tell you these things.

333
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:54,880
I'm already your boss now.

334
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,140
Just tell me.

335
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:58,000
That's right!

336
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:01,030
So, let me tell you this.

337
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:12,640
He keeps his account card for our guild in his room.

338
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:33,060
Hey...

339
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:36,660
What are you doing here?

340
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:38,200
Do you need something?

341
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:41,780
If you are interested in Glory,

342
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:43,880
I can help you sign up for an account.

343
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:50,760
But that book is too difficult for you.

344
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:53,240
I have a better introductory textbook.

345
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,780
No need.

346
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:04,800
True.

347
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:08,300
After all, you've got to learn how to play Glory by yourself.

348
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:11,400
Do you know that Glory implements a one-person-one-card policy?

349
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:16,600
So, the account card is the player's lifeline.

350
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:19,060
The day you really get an account,

351
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:21,420
do remember to put the account card in a safe place,

352
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:26,420
preferably a place that no one else can find.

353
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:28,060
I'm going.

354
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:35,400
A place that no one else can find?

355
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,880
A place...

356
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:43,940
A place...

357
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:59,120
President Ye, what are you doing up there?

358
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:02,721
I've got nothing else to do.

359
00:24:02,721 --> 00:24:04,820
So I'm checking the hygiene here.

360
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:06,440
It's so dirty.

361
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:07,840
Fortunately,

362
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,380
there is a box of drinks under the bed.

363
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:10,720
Could you please carry them downstairs?

364
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,780
It's so heavy that I couldn't move it myself.

365
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:14,820
Drinks?

366
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:17,300
But I didn't see any drinks under the bed?

367
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:22,380
Just take another look, take another look.

368
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:24,160
Thank you!

369
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:28,720
There are no drinks?

370
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,520
I found it!

371
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:47,920
That hurts.

372
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:53,340
   

373
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:56,640
I didn't expect him to be so popular.

374
00:24:57,260 --> 00:24:59,940
Master, you're online at last!

375
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:01,780
I have something to talk to you about.

376
00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:04,240
Recently, the guild has recruited too many members.

377
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:06,220
The old members are constantly at odds with the newcomers.

378
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:09,080
So should we take some countermeasures to reassure everyone?

379
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:10,680
This question is exactly what I needed!

380
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:12,900
Great timing!

381
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:14,200
Surely it's necessary!

382
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:15,740
From the perspective of management,

383
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:17,580
the biggest problem facing the Team Happy guild

384
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:20,240
is the uneven distribution of skill points among members

385
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:23,980
resulting in an imbalance in the final distribution.

386
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:29,000
Master, why are you suddenly speaking in such a serious tone?

387
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:32,860
Seems that I have to use a softer tone.

388
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:36,240
To solve this problem, you have to start with the root cause.

389
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:40,040
So... uh...

390
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:42,660
What exactly do you mean?

391
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:46,180
First, disband the guild.

392
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:47,440
When the opportunity comes,

393
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:50,292
recruit another batch of members whose abilities are relatively more stable.

394
00:25:50,292 --> 00:25:54,160
But... If we disband a guild that has just been created,

395
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:57,300
we won't able to gain a foothold in the 10th District again!

396
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:58,520
I'll take responsibility for the consequences.

397
00:25:58,520 --> 00:25:59,980
Anyway, first disband.

398
00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:01,360
Don't keep any players.

399
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,820
If you have any doubts, we'll talk about it later.

400
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:07,520
But... But we should at least give out some red packets, right?

401
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:09,920
Otherwise, the group chat will be a mess!

402
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:14,340
Alright, give me an amount.

403
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:16,340
I will transfer the money to you now.

404
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:25,160
Okay! I'm disbanding right now!

405
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:27,060
The guild has been destroyed.

406
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:30,340
You can no longer be the thief-in-chief in Glory!

407
00:26:31,230 --> 00:26:32,240
   

408
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:36,000
 This time, I will definitely take you home. 

409
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,320
 From this moment on, everything will come to an end. 

410
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:42,120
What? You've given up?

411
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:45,040
You know I'm not that kind of person.

412
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:46,870
   
  ] 

413
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:55,120
Who do you think will appear on this poster in the future?

414
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:58,100
It's really hard to say.

415
00:26:58,100 --> 00:27:00,180
But I'm sure that

416
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:03,760
this will be the last time you come here.

417
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:09,340
You're right.

418
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:13,820
Even if I wanted to come, I'm afraid I won't get that opportunity.

419
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:15,880
Opportunities are always available,

420
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:18,880
as long as you are willing to contribute.

421
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:24,580
Why aren't you moving the box?

422
00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:27,840
Judging from your alcohol tolerance, this is enough.

423
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:37,420
   

424
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:42,430
This is the first time I get to spend the New Year's Eve with other people.

425
00:27:42,430 --> 00:27:43,380
- Cheers! 
 - Cheers!

426
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:46,420
- Good fortune and great profit! 
 - Happy Spring Festival!

427
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:48,200
Peace all year long!

428
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:52,600
Go home soon!

429
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:55,100
Happy New Year!

430
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:04,980
Come on, here's to you!

431
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:06,260
Thank you for being so generous,

432
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:10,000
enabling our team to enjoy a fantastic Spring Festival!

433
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:13,400
What do you mean?

434
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:18,300
 You were telling me to welcome the god of wealth. 

435
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:20,420
 What exactly should I do? 

436
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:24,600
 The easiest way to trick a rich heir is to talk to them about money. 

437
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:26,420
 Your brother is really bad at finding stuff. 

438
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:28,740
 Didn't you tell us he's smart? 

439
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:31,420
 I may need to go in and drop a hint. 

440
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:32,540
 Okay. 

441
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:34,000
 Take this. 

442
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,780
 How is it going? 

443
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:50,940
 President Ye, there is a box of drinks under the bed. 

444
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:52,500
 Could you please carry it downstairs? 

445
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:54,580
 I found it! 

446
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:07,060
So, you guys have been playing me from the beginning.

447
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:10,460
You delivered yourself to our doorsteps.

448
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:13,380
How could we turn you down?

449
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:15,860
You were the mastermind behind it all, right?

450
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:20,720
Ye Xiu... Ye Xiu.

451
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,780
You're really...

452
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:30,620
So he's...

453
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:33,321
- drunk? 
 - It will only take one glass.

454
00:29:33,321 --> 00:29:34,980
He was like this ten years ago.

455
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:37,080
The same ten years later.

456
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:41,980
Are you okay?

457
00:29:46,580 --> 00:29:49,800
Everyone's exhausted after a day's work.

458
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:52,460
Let me carry... carry this guy away.

459
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:55,460
- You two, go to bed early. 
 - The coat!

460
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:05,760
They sure have the same genes!

461
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:09,080
Turns out he's as weak as his brother.

462
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:13,910
   

463
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:25,600
Happy New Year!

464
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:27,780
Childish!

465
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:31,700
You need to keep your innocence to be happy every day!

466
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:33,860
Lunar New Year's Day! Good fortune and great profit!

467
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:36,180
Come on, ask for some good luck!

468
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:45,320
Here, a red packet for you!

469
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:46,860
Childish.

470
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:48,140
I've always been the one who gives red packets to others.

471
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:49,361
That's your rule!

472
00:30:49,361 --> 00:30:52,680
Now you're at my place. I'm the one who calls the shots.

473
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:54,820
There is a world of difference between you and your brother.

474
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:57,880
Your brother never hesitated to grab a red packet!

475
00:30:57,880 --> 00:31:00,700
Here you are, Mucheng! This one is for you!

476
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:02,660
Thank you, Boss!

477
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:04,940
Boss, may a river of gold flow into your pocket.

478
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:06,140
Good luck with your business!

479
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:07,200
Seems that this place...

480
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,960
 May you have today's glory forever! 

481
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:11,140
Is not as bad as I thought.

482
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:28,500
What's that?

483
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:30,320
It's from your brother.

484
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:33,280
Another trick?

485
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:37,180
It's a gift that he specifically prepared for you.

486
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:40,660
Since when did he become so cheesy?

487
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:42,580
Do you think you're the only person that has changed?

488
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:44,980
Over the years, he's changed a lot as well.

489
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:46,900
Except for his alcohol tolerance.

490
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:51,940
You were not drunk last night. Isn't that right?

491
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:54,960
He has been away from home for so long.

492
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:58,160
He still thinks that it would only take one glass for me to get drunk?

493
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:02,440
So you pretended to be drunk to save him from the embarrassment

494
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:06,200
so that everybody could enjoy a happy New Year's Eve.

495
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:08,160
I'm not as noble as you think.

496
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:09,680
You guys outnumbered me.

497
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:13,540
Those who suit their actions to the time are wise.

498
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:16,007
You're just being stubborn and reluctant to admit you care about him!

499
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:18,380
Where is he?

500
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:20,580
He's not even embarrassed because he's not seeing me off.

501
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:25,713
Your brother... is fixing the water pipes on the rooftop right now.

502
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:44,340
Are you sure you're not making everything worse?

503
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:54,200
What are you doing?

504
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:57,380
Making everything worse.

505
00:32:57,380 --> 00:33:00,180
Do you need me to do more, just to "make sure"?

506
00:33:04,180 --> 00:33:08,500
Alright. An eye for eye, a tooth for tooth.

507
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:11,180
Let's put an end to all the resentment from the past ten years.

508
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:23,780
Brat, do you think I would be afraid of you?

509
00:33:56,140 --> 00:33:57,780
You threw away your comfortable life at home

510
00:33:57,780 --> 00:34:00,000
and ended up here doing all this hard work.

511
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,920
You're really a man of integrity.

512
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:04,500
I did all that to leave father to you.

513
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:07,700
Don't make my efforts go to waste.

514
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:10,000
All your efforts to trick me,

515
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,700
I should thank you, you've worked hard.

516
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:15,980
I'd also like to thank you for working so hard to fall into my traps!

517
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:19,760
If it hadn't been for your tricks, I wouldn't have ended up like this!

518
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:21,500
Like what? I only got your clothes wet.

519
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:24,640
- There is a dryer in our net cafe. 
 - Stop playing dumb.

520
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:26,780
I was talking about that time when

521
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:31,200
you stole my opportunity to go to the summer camp!

522
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:33,820
You? Save it!

523
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:36,489
A person who decided to go to the summer camp because of a Transformer toy

524
00:34:36,489 --> 00:34:38,280
would only let the opportunity go to waste anyway.

525
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:42,140
Just stay at home and be a president.

526
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:48,980
 I can't take it anymore! 

527
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:53,260
 If you don't let me play with the Transformer, 

528
00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:55,920
 I'm not staying here any longer. 

529
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:58,240
 I am going to summer camp! 

530
00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:03,800
 What are you doing here? 

531
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:08,100
 You're packing things up? Where are you going? 

532
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:10,420
 Attending a school event? 

533
00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:13,520
 Our teacher just notified us that we have to go to a training. 

534
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:16,520
 It was Teacher Wang who notified you, right? 

535
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:19,300
 That's right! It was Teacher Wang! 

536
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:21,220
 But that doesn't make sense. 

537
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:24,620
 It was that Teacher Wang who has already resigned 

538
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:27,520
 that notified you to go to a training? 

539
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:43,200
 Brother, these are all your favorite things, 

540
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:45,280
 and the money you saved up. 

541
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:47,000
 Are you really giving them all to me? 

542
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,300
 Of course! 

543
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:52,080
 You're my only brother. Who else would I give them to? 

544
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:56,240
 Ye Qiu, please come downstairs. 

545
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:01,661
 Go ahead. I'll help you here. 

546
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:09,100
 Son, come here. 

547
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:10,700
 Dad. 

548
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:13,100
 Don't be upset. 

549
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:15,560
 Forget about the broken Transformer toy. 

550
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:17,820
 I've gotten you a new gift. 

551
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:21,780
 Thank you, Dad. 

552
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:27,020
 You like watching foreign movies, right? 

553
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:30,280
 So you've got to learn English well, right? 

554
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:31,780
 That's right. 

555
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,960
 Brother? 

556
00:36:40,950 --> 00:36:44,360
   

557
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:46,300
 Oh, no. 

558
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:50,100
 Darn it, give my luggage back to me! 

559
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:51,530
If I wanted to leave home because of the Transformer,

560
00:36:51,530 --> 00:36:53,200
you were no better than me!

561
00:36:53,201 --> 00:36:54,540
You left because you wanted to play Glory.

562
00:36:54,540 --> 00:36:56,480
I'm not your average gamer.

563
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:58,440
I'm a professional. Understand?

564
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:01,720
I don't understand.

565
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,100
So, all a president does is count money. You don't study at all?

566
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:09,260
But you have already retired

567
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:12,200
Retirement doesn't mean anything.

568
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:17,480
It just means that I need to start all over again.

569
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:19,520
The sportsman's mentality. Understand?

570
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:22,545
But how are you going to start all over again? By building a team?

571
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:25,260
Yes.

572
00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:32,340
It's not that easy to build a team!

573
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,980
Is it easy to be a president?

574
00:37:36,740 --> 00:37:38,680
You know what I mean.

575
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:40,540
It's not like the old days anymore.

576
00:37:40,540 --> 00:37:43,620
The esports industry has been completely commercialized.

577
00:37:43,620 --> 00:37:44,880
If you want to build a team,

578
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:48,440
the funds, resources, and contacts are all indispensable.

579
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:54,360
Are you really prepared for what's coming?

580
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:59,900
Besides, this isn't only about you.

581
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:03,320
Like it or not, it's going to impact many other people's lives.

582
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:05,600
You can't just hold onto your own dream.

583
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:08,500
You'll also have to consider a lot of problems in the real world!

584
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:16,420
I know.

585
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:22,520
For you. Remember to wear them.

586
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:31,260
Okay. I've said all there is to be said about it.

587
00:38:33,940 --> 00:38:38,240
I'll keep this from our family for now.

588
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:42,040
But I have no control over the future.

589
00:38:57,020 --> 00:38:58,720
Having played for so many years,

590
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:00,260
who can still be so passionate about a game?

591
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:02,360
Aren't you tired of it?

592
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:10,260
Glory...

593
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:13,520
I won't ever get tired of it even if I play it for another ten years.

594
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:17,240
I'm going.

595
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:43,760
Bye bye!

596
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:50,200
- Drive. 
 - Okay.

597
00:39:55,380 --> 00:39:57,280
He's finally gone.

598
00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:00,100
He's even more high maintenance than you.

599
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:07,920
Is my brother really high maintenance?

600
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:14,340
Hey, wait a minute.

601
00:40:17,420 --> 00:40:22,100
Are you Ye Qiu or Ye Xiu?

602
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:25,700
Qiu Qiu.

603
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:27,880
Qiu Qiu?

604
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:30,400
If you were Ye Qiu, I'd be Xiu Xiu.

605
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:32,120
Are you trying to fool me?

606
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:37,060
Your IQ is online.

607
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:44,680
Why not buy me a new one, for goodness sake?

608
00:40:45,460 --> 00:40:47,820
What was the point of fixing this old shabby one?

609
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:16,320
   

610
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:20,500
Ye Xiu, you're still trying to trick me?

611
00:41:22,060 --> 00:41:32,050
