 "Light From the Ashes" - Cai Weize 

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:06,200
♫  Countless fireflies born from insignificance  ♫

3
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:10,010
♫  Riding the long wind to gather into a shining galaxy  ♫

4
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:13,900
♫  Proclaim to the world on top of the sky  ♫

5
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:19,020
♫  We will return in glory  ♫

6
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:23,710
♫  Clear the clouds and descend with the heat  ♫

7
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:27,250
♫  Melting ice and snow, overcoming twists and turns  ♫

8
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:31,030
♫  Finally at this moment of peak  ♫

9
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:35,290
♫  There is a figure that coincides with the past  ♫

10
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:38,900
♫  The glory of the past that never came  ♫

11
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:42,630
♫  The pride that the future will never pass  ♫

12
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:46,360
♫  Our fingertips intertwined and condensed  ♫

13
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:50,420
♫  Into a song that ignited the battlefield  ♫

14
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:54,250
♫  The only light in an endless night  ♫

15
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:58,020
♫  Is you and me who overcame mediocrity  ♫

16
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:01,940
♫  Is you and me who overcame mediocrity  ♫

17
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:05,610
♫  Fireflies making every effort to illuminate  ♫

18
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:09,640
♫  I came from the legend to carry on a legend  ♫

19
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:13,390
♫  Once it's disruptive, a decade of persistence won't be in vain  ♫

20
00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:17,160
♫  Up on the clouds and down in the dust  ♫

21
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:20,900
♫  Fireflies making every effort to illuminate  ♫

22
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:24,710
♫  Fireflies making every effort to illuminate  ♫

23
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:27,960
   

24
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:30,110
   

25
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:37,040
We're having hotpot.

26
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,080
 Having hotpot? 

27
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:40,980
 So ungrateful, tossing me aside after you're done using me. 

28
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:43,020
 - How can you abandon your hero to eat hotpot?  
 - Eat.

29
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:44,320
 Who are you eating with? 

30
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:45,720
 Where are you eating? Why didn't you invite me? 

31
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,680
Invite you? Can you even come here?

32
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:51,120
  If you reimburse me for travel expenses, I can consider it. 

33
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,360
I finally know what you are scheming.

34
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,800
No wonder Captain said you will come back sooner or later.

35
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:59,840
Have you already planned to form a team with the people around you,

36
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,060
 so that you can come back to the League with a new team? 

37
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:04,260
  Tell me honestly. I'm right, aren't I? 

38
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:05,720
 Hello? 

39
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:07,840
 Hello? Hello? Hello? 

40
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:08,800
 Have more, have more! 

41
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,880
 Master, try this one. 

42

 Subtitles and Timing provided to you by💥🍥 TEAM 7️⃣ 🍥💥 @viki.com 

43
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,960
 Cheers! 

44
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,840
 Shall I form... 

45
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:39,500
 a new team? 

46
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:47,840
 Grandmaster! Grandmaster! 

47
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,360
Miss! Miss!

48
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,440
- Miss! Are you going in or not? 
 - Are you going in?

49
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,940
I'm going in. Thank you.

50
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:54,480
Miss, you dropped your admission ticket.

51
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,600
 Grandmaster! Grandmaster! Grandmaster! 

52
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,101
Thank you.

53
00:02:57,101 --> 00:03:04,201
 Grandmaster! Grandmaster! Grandmaster! 

54
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,461
 Grandmaster! 

55
00:03:07,461 --> 00:03:08,600
 Grandmaster! Grandmaster! Grandmaster! 

56
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:09,820
 Grandmaster! 

57
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:12,040
 Grandmaster! Grandmaster! Grandmaster! 

58
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:13,561
Thank you!

59
00:03:13,561 --> 00:03:21,280
 Grandmaster! Grandmaster! Grandmaster! 

60
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,560
 Grandmaster! Grandmaster! Grandmaster! 

61
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:26,880
 Grandmaster! Grandmaster! Grandmaster! 

62
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:29,260
With you all the way!

63
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:32,120
 Grandmaster! Grandmaster! Grandmaster! 

64
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:34,960
   

65
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,920
   

66
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:38,160
   

67
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:42,760
   

68
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:48,520
Hello, everyone.

69
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:57,660
The booing makes me feel like I'm in a LAN* tournament. 
  (*Local Area Network) 

70
00:03:57,660 --> 00:04:01,300
Actually, I know why everyone is booing.

71
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:04,660
Earlier, the media asked me

72
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:10,040
why Excellent Era recently lost three consecutive rounds.

73
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:15,260
It's because it's already the midseason and all players are experiencing gaming fatigue.

74
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:20,620
However, those are just meaningless official statements.

75
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:30,060
The real reason is Excellent Era is going through the pains of integration.

76
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:33,060
This is the price that must be paid when bringing in new blood,

77
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:36,580
but we can't give up on upgrading and iterations just because of fear.

78
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:38,980
In the last three games, Sun Xiang was obsessed with going solo.

79
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:40,580
His damage only accounted for 14% of the team,

80
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:42,840
far below Ye Qiu's average of 72%.

81
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:45,440
Besides, in the game against Blue Rain,

82
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,621
if it weren't for Sun Xiang's reckless attack at the last moment,

83
00:04:47,621 --> 00:04:49,040
they wouldn't have been able to turn the game around.

84
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,880
You just said this was the result of the iteration of Excellent Era.

85
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:53,640
Since the iteration is a total failure,

86
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:54,860
why insist on doing it?

87
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:56,580
 Exactly! Why? 

88
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:57,920
Ye Qiu is obviously still a top player.

89
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,460
Why did you replace him with Sun Xiang?

90
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:02,440
All right! I'll give you an answer.

91
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:07,664
The reason why Ye Qiu retired and was replaced by Sun Xiang...

92
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:10,560
was because...

93
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,620
 If you terminate the contract, 

94
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:16,240
 you can't get a dime. 

95
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:20,640
 I choose to retire. 

96
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,560
...it was his decision.

97
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,680
 How could that be? It can't be! 

98
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:25,681
 It cannot be! 

99
00:05:25,681 --> 00:05:27,880
Maybe you won't believe it.

100
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:33,760
In your eyes, Ye Qiu is a Glory grandmaster, Excellent Era's top player.

101
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:39,920
But for me, he is an old friend who worked with me for ten years.

102
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:44,280
As his old friend, I never regretted supporting his decision,

103
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:48,060
and sometimes even felt that this was the best for him.

104
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:49,260
What gave you the right to say that?

105
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:51,000
 Yeah! 

106
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,380
Ten years!

107
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:58,980
He dedicated ten years of his prime to Excellent Era.

108
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:03,580
But a man is vulnerable to time no matter how strong he is.

109
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:06,920
So if he really wanted to leave this time,

110
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:09,161
could we just be considerate of him once?

111
00:06:09,161 --> 00:06:11,520
Even just for once.

112
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:22,140
So, on behalf of my friend, I would like to say thank you to everyone.

113
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:31,880
These are the honors Ye Qiu earned for Excellent Era.

114
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:34,480
Three championship trophies,

115
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:36,800
the MVP awards of three seasons,

116
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,920
and a variety of other awards.

117
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:46,240
However, after today,

118
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,880
I will seal them up

119
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,660
and put them in Excellent Era's hall of fame.

120
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:58,360
Let's come together to commemorate a legendary era that has passed!

121
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:16,820
♫  Your old coat is like a sturdy umbrella  ♫

122
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:25,980
♫  That protects me from the harshness of the weather  ♫

123
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:36,269
♫  You would even divide your bowl of instant noodle with me  ♫

124
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:40,680
 If I really have to say goodbye, 

125
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:44,660
 I hope it doesn't mean that we'll never reunite. 

126
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:51,800
 But that one day, we'll be able to see each other again. 

127
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:58,080
 One Autumn Leaf, see you again. 

128
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:06,620
 He dedicated ten years of his prime to Excellent Era. 

129
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:11,600
 But a man is vulnerable to time no matter how strong he is. 

130
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,800
We're doomed.

131
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,500
Boss will definitely be furious when she comes back.

132
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,020
 So if he really wanted to leave this time, 

133
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:18,540
I wish I had answered the call and gone with her.

134
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:20,580
 Even just for once. 

135
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:24,100
 - So—  
 - She's back.

136
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:26,940
Guo Guo, you're back.

137
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,100
You actually stood me up today!

138
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:35,440
Do you know how serious the consequences will be?

139
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,221
- I... 
 - Don't try to explain. No excuses.

140
00:08:37,221 --> 00:08:38,640
I have to punish you.

141
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:42,541
- Guo Guo, my phone... 
 - Don't plead for yourself.

142
00:08:42,541 --> 00:08:44,940
I need to give it some thought.

143
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:49,420
Should I ask you to buy the action figures for me,

144
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:53,060
or to clean the warehouse for me?

145
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:57,060
Guo Guo...

146
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:58,840
I'll put it on your tab.

147
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:02,240
I'll think about how to torture you.

148
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,560
Guo Guo...

149
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,900
And you!

150
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:11,070
And you!

151
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:13,480
You‘e the culprit!

152
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:16,840
Network admin, if it wasn't for you,

153
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:21,360
Tang wouldn't have flaked on me to meet you.

154
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:25,240
As her boss, I find it very disrespectful.

155
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,340
All right, punish me if you want.

156
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:29,240
Of course I have to punish you!

157
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:36,220
You have to clean every pot of plants and every leaf here.

158
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:40,660
And you have to clean the rim of each cup.

159
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:44,080
Guo Guo, you...

160
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,380
I'm really tired.

161
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:49,420
I need to go back to my room to rest.

162
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,861
Didn't you see she was in a bad mood today?

163
00:10:01,861 --> 00:10:05,740
Every word Tao Xuan said poked into her heart.

164
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:07,860
I saw it.

165
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:09,600
So?

166
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,860
I didn't want to expose her feelings.

167
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:13,400
Why?

168
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:16,480
Only those who are vulnerable need comfort.

169
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:19,900
Our tough boss is completely able to...

170
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:23,280
heal by herself.

171
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:40,320
Washing cups at this hour?

172
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,420
It's the punishment you gave me.

173
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,940
Those were just casual words.

174
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:47,880
You don't have to take it seriously.

175
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:54,020
I've heard too many casual words today,

176
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:59,400
casually talking about letting go,

177
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:02,640
casually talking about leaving.

178
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:07,580
And all of them believed it,

179
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:10,440
except me. I didn't believe it.

180
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,200
I believe it.

181
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,000
I believe your casual words.

182
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,100
Look.

183
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:21,281
I figured out the trick to washing cups.

184
00:12:21,281 --> 00:12:22,840
Thank you for your casual words.

185
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:26,620
Now I can be a semi-professional network admin.

186
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:31,800
Brat.

187
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,340
What's up?

188
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,840
If you spent 10 years in my net cafe as a network admin,

189
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:45,580
would you be reluctant to leave?

190
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,760
If I had been doing the same thing for ten years,

191
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:52,520
I must have been enjoying it.

192
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:54,000
Since I've been enjoying it,

193
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,400
I wouldn't care if I leave or not.

194
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:59,100
As long as the heart is still here,

195
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:01,120
it doesn't count as leaving.

196
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:15,240
But what if...

197
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:19,820
he has already given up?

198
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,800
How do you know that he has given up?

199
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:28,780
Does leaving not count as giving up?

200
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:45,240
The cup is a vase now.

201
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:48,120
Maybe he's taking a new path to start over.

202
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:52,480
Boss, what do you think?

203
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:16,530
   

204
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:35,000
Wake up, guys.

205
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,560
Time to raid dungeons.

206
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:46,460
Where have they gone?

207
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:49,560
Guild Master, they're all creating new accounts downstairs.

208
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:51,020
The guild has more than one hundred accounts.

209
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:51,840
Why are they creating new accounts?

210
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,820
You must have forgotten. Last time at the Congee Forest,

211
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:57,760
Lord Grim trashed more than 90 of our guild accounts.

212
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:00,760
Is there anyone who can teach Lord Grim a lesson?

213
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,460
The captain is upstairs.

214
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:05,340
He must have a way.

215
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,640
I am going to talk to the captain.

216
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:13,140
If I don't make it back, take care of the guild.

217
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:15,360
Boss, you only have one minute.

218
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,640
Wenqing, there will be an exhibition match tomorrow.

219
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:20,440
I'd like to send a few players over.

220
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:21,640
It's tournament season.

221
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:23,440
- It will affect their training. 
 - But...

222
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:26,320
If there's nothing else, please leave now.

223
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:31,240
Good day, Boss.

224
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,360
Are you here to meet the captain, as well?

225
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:35,000
No. I'm here for the co-captain.

226
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,620
Co-captain!

227
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:03,400
Co-captain, I finally found you.

228
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:17,140
The thing is, there's a player named Lord Grim in the 10th Server.

229
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:19,160
He's a strong...

230
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:25,340
   
   

231
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,280
So you came here for me

232
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:39,501
hoping I can help you kill Lord Grim, right?

233
00:16:39,501 --> 00:16:41,360
Exactly! You are our co-captain.

234
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,920
I hope you can step up and—

235
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:45,640
I feel uncomfortable talking to you

236
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:48,540
because your second button is not buttoned properly.

237
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:52,680
All right now?

238
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:56,340
All right.

239
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:57,460
Now we can talk about Lord Grim.

240
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:03,110
   

241
00:17:06,930 --> 00:17:08,570
   

242
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:19,880
Line Canyon.

243
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:22,040
Lord Grim will have to pass through here, right?

244
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:23,280
Yes, Co-captain.

245
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,160
All right, then let's go.

246
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:37,840
Engage.

247
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:45,100
Ghostblade, go to area 113, 224.

248
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:47,400
Launcher, 156, 281.

249
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:17,720
 Your initial position puts you at an advantage. 

250
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:19,840
 And you're able to do a lockdown. 

251
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,880
 But it's a pity, Xinjie, 

252
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,480
 your teammates were too weak. 

253
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:26,480
 And your opponent was me. 

254
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,240
I didn't expect it to be you.

255
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,400
It seems that I was careless.

256
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,040
Co-captain, do you know Lord Grim?

257
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,600
 What kind of tricks are you playing? 

258
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,869
 The co-captain of Tyranny personally brought people to block me. 

259
00:18:37,869 --> 00:18:39,000
I came looking for you

260
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,640
because the guild entrusted me with a task

261
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:41,821
in hopes that you won't mess with

262
00:18:41,821 --> 00:18:44,000
Tyrannical Ambition's dungeon records anymore.

263
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:48,680
 I thought it was something big. 

264
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:53,360
 Xinjie, how come you're now concerned with the guild's affairs? 

265
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:55,800
You know that I won't listen to your trash talk.

266
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,840
It's not only about the dungeon records.

267
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:00,880
Nobody is allowed to break the rules in Glory.

268
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,540
 What are the rules of Glory? 

269
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:04,000
 Isn't it that the top player is the king? 

270
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,880
All right, then let's do it according to the rules of Glory.

271
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,100
Let's PK.

272
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:11,320
Whoever wins has the final say.

273
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:12,620
 Me against you? 

274
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:14,000
It'll be us against you guys.

275
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,980
3:00 p.m. at the Arena.

276
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:17,160
Team battle.

277
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,640
 If you lose, 

278
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:21,780
 never interfere with the dungeon records again. 

279
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,640
 If they shut me out of the dungeons, 

280
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:31,640
 I won‘t be able to access the hidden bosses. 

281
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:33,200
 If I can't access the hidden bosses, 

282
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,701
 I won't be able to get rare items 

283
00:19:34,701 --> 00:19:36,701
 to upgrade the Myriad Manifestation Umbrella 

284
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:40,980
 I have to win this bet. 

285
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:55,140
- Co-captain. 
 - Not now.

286
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:56,980
The captain is in training.

287
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:00,560
How much longer will the captain train?

288
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:03,080
This is the captain's daily training program.

289
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:04,520
It starts at 12:00

290
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:06,800
and lasts half an hour.

291
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:09,600
Twenty minutes left.

292
00:20:10,390 --> 00:20:13,130
   

293
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:18,760
 For a veteran who has been in the league for ten years, 

294
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:22,680
 stamina would be his biggest problem. 

295
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:27,700
 We admire the fighting spirit he has shown in trainings and matches. 

296
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:35,440
 But we have to admit that sheer fighting spirit 

297
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:38,080
 is not enough to help him resist the ravages of time. 

298
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:43,320
 If he is unable to reach the top, 

299
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:45,920
 he may slide all the way to the abyss. 

300
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:57,800
 Perhaps leaving is the wisest choice, 

301
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:02,900
 because the height of glory can be harsh and unforgiving. 

302
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:10,700
 Behind the radiant glory 

303
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:14,420
 is the resilience to face the passage of time. 

304
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:35,840
 Let's bid farewell to the veteran as he retires. 

305
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,640
Cap... Captain.

306
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,640
1.3 seconds slower than last time.

307
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:52,220
Time is not the only standard.

308
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:54,940
But time is the most reliable standard.

309
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:58,780
Something happened in the guild?

310
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:00,381
Captain, so the thing is,

311
00:22:00,381 --> 00:22:03,080
- the newly-opened— 
 - Get to the point.

312
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:07,600
We came across a player named Lord Grim in Glory.

313
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:11,060
After the fight, we found out he was Ye Qiu.

314
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:15,141
Didn't Ye Qiu retire?

315
00:22:15,141 --> 00:22:17,080
How come he went into the world of Glory?

316
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:18,760
He is very active in Glory.

317
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:21,940
In three days' time, he broke two of Tyranny's dungeon records.

318
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:29,340
To abuse noobs in Glory, of course, he would be active.

319
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:43,100
 After seven seasons, two finals 

320
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:45,160
 and a history of intense battles in Glory, 

321
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:47,640
 the All-Star Game tonight 

322
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:50,980
 reignites their rivalry. 

323
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:56,120
 You fought so aggressively. 

324
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:57,800
 That's because the opponent was you. 

325
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:59,540
 I won't let you win next time. 

326
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:03,920
 Okay. Don't be a deserter by then. 

327
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:07,980
 I will only fight to the end, never retreat halfway. 

328
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:17,140
 Then see you at the All-Star next year! 

329
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:19,580
 See you next year. 

330
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:28,320
I'd like to see how weak he has become.

331
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:31,600
Warm up!

332
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,020
Okay!

333
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:48,940
Boss!

334
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:58,100
Boss!

335
00:24:58,100 --> 00:25:01,920
I can tell that this gear is a perfect match for my playstyle.

336
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,360
Take your pick.

337
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:05,180
Hooray!

338
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:08,540
We're going to have a match against Tyranny later.

339
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:10,420
Tyranny's Guild?

340
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:12,400
Team Tyranny?

341
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,440
That's right.

342
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:16,400
Tyranny's playstyle is aggressive,

343
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,500
even their Cleric can join fights,

344
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:20,040
and he can deal significant damage.

345
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:22,700
But the key to Tyranny's wins lies in tactics.

346
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:27,240
So for us, the initial position is very important.

347
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:29,220
- It's time. 
 - So...

348
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:30,920
Let's go.

349
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:42,480
   

350
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:46,241
- Push hard at the Ghostblade on the left. 
 - Roger that.

351
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:55,240
Nice! Got him! One more hit and he's dead.

352
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:57,820
No! No! I'm being ganked! I'm going to die!

353
00:25:57,820 --> 00:26:00,980
Switch your position. I'm here. They won't be able to kill you.

354
00:26:02,610 --> 00:26:04,290
   

355
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:09,140
Holy crap. The Cleric is a freak!

356
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:10,740
As I said, I'm here with you.

357
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:12,660
Want to kill my people? In their dreams.

358
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:15,220
Co-captain, you're over-healing me.

359
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:18,900
Next time they target you, I'll make them pay.

360
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:29,520
Master, if we don't kill Zhang Xinjie,

361
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:30,840
Tyranny's players will be invincible.

362
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:33,380
I repeat. Push hard on the Ghostblade.

363
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:35,640
Feign attack. Brawler, attack from the rear.

364
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:37,300
Okay.

365
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:50,461
If one brick is not enough to kill, I'll give another one!

366
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:57,480
Only one more hit was needed!

367
00:26:57,480 --> 00:27:00,200
This Cleric is my bane.

368
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:03,260
Ghostblade, 114, 236. Launcher, 178, 319.

369
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:04,480
Wait for your cooldowns.

370
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:07,000
Let them know the price of trying to kill you.

371
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:22,040
I didn't expect Ye Qiu to be so stubborn.

372
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:25,920
Seems like we need to reevaluate the Four Master Tacticians.

373
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:33,880
Only 3 of the Four Master Tacticians are still around.

374
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:37,660
Don't waste time on them. Draw the net.

375
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:43,200
Yi Fan, give me a Ghost Boundary.

376
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,020
Roger that.

377
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,820
Baited!

378
00:28:05,990 --> 00:28:07,940
   
   

379
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:10,720
Why didn't I get healed?

380
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:12,820
We were baited.

381
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:15,420
As I've said, we're going to kill your Ghostblade.

382
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:18,240
You're still so cunning.

383
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:23,660
You were right. Of the Four Master Tacticians,

384
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:25,200
only three are still around.

385
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,240
What happened?

386
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:31,080
My bad. His two feign attacks

387
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:34,440
tricked me into relaxing my defenses and changing the formation

388
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:36,560
so that he could kill you.

389
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:37,980
 Back in the old days, 

390
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:40,401
 you would never be more than 120 units away from your teammates, 

391
00:28:40,401 --> 00:28:42,640
 the maximum AOE range for the Holy Heal. 

392
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:45,240
 Xinjie, your abilities have deteriorated. 

393
00:28:46,820 --> 00:28:48,720
Do you think this is over?

394
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,680
 We have a big advantage now. 

395
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:52,420
Advantage?

396
00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:54,694
Seems like you have really underestimated Tyranny.

397
00:28:54,694 --> 00:28:58,260
And greatly underestimated the abilities of Clerics.

398
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:07,700
Back off! Back off!

399
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:38,460
You're finally here.

400
00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:01,320
I got one-shot even before seeing who that new guy was.

401
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:05,700
This guy...

402
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:09,320
That person is like another him.

403
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:16,741
I was wondering who that impressive player was.

404
00:30:16,741 --> 00:30:20,261
Turns out to be a deserter leading a bunch of noobs.

405
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:23,380
Why haven't you changed at all?

406
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:25,500
You hit the ground running.

407
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:28,300
Manage your pacing to preserve your stamina.

408
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,600
So that I could be a deserter like you?

409
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:38,380
I will only move forward, never retreating halfway!

410
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:41,640
Do not engage.

411
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:43,721
I'll 1v1.

412
00:30:43,721 --> 00:30:46,000
Are you going easy on me?

413
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:50,000
Going easy on me is just like playing with fire.

414
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,220
I'm not afraid to play with fire.

415
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:53,820
How about you?

416
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:20,340
If you want me to win, just kill yourself.

417
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:22,240
Why put on such an act?

418
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:25,420
I just wanted to know if you deserted

419
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:28,180
or got kicked out.

420
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:30,720
Do you need me to prove it to you?

421
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:58,480
Seems like you deserted.

422
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:02,100
See you at the tournaments.

423
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:07,040
That would be the real victory.

424
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:33,900
 I have no plans to retire. 

425
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:35,460
 What about you? 

426
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:41,340
 My career will definitely be one day longer than yours. 

427
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:44,780
 Bluff! We'll see! 

428
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:24,360
Your expression suggests an ulterior motive.

429
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:26,140
The fact that you can still make a joke

430
00:33:26,140 --> 00:33:29,080
means your stamina is still good.

431
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:34,420
My stamina is not as robust as it looks.

432
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:41,320
Your hands feel weak?

433
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:43,260
Not only my hands.

434
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:45,340
My whole body is now so weak.

435
00:33:45,340 --> 00:33:48,320
I have palpitations. I feel dizzy and light-headed.

436
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:50,440
This bottle of water, I can't.

437
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:53,500
I'll help you.

438
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:55,460
Actually, I don't want to open it.

439
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:58,940
You should give me some liquor.

440
00:33:58,940 --> 00:34:01,040
I promise to drink it up in one second.

441
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:07,200
You just said you feel sick, now you're asking for liquor.

442
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:11,740
From today on, the dungeon records

443
00:34:11,740 --> 00:34:15,000
and I will become two parallel lines that never intersect.

444
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,490
Isn't this a heart-palpitating,

445
00:34:16,490 --> 00:34:19,000
nauseous, and light-headed-inducing kind of tragic story?

446
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:23,580
From today on,

447
00:34:23,580 --> 00:34:26,020
are you really going to stop breaking dungeon records?

448
00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:39,300
This is the consequence of losing the bet.

449
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:45,240
What about the items from the dungeons?

450
00:34:49,940 --> 00:34:53,180
If this road is blocked, let's get on another one.

451
00:34:53,180 --> 00:34:55,320
Why is it that the more I know about Glory,

452
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:59,040
the weaker I feel?

453
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:03,900
As I've said before, you should see the gap.

454
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:06,120
It's a big, big world in Glory.

455
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:07,560
When you were just starting, you were unlucky

456
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:10,640
- to have met the— 
 - The top-tier players of Glory.

457
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:16,580
Sometimes I really don't know whether you are telling the truth or not.

458
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:21,740
But I said that I will beat you,

459
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:24,160
I will definitely do it.

460
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:29,200
Even if you're the highest and most insurmountable peak.

461
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:35,620
I'll be waiting for you at the top.

462
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:37,580
Thanks.

463
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:50,600
Ye Qiu is coming back, right?

464
00:35:52,220 --> 00:35:53,440
Of course.

465
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:54,700
Moving forward,

466
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:57,620
I'll put more effort into gathering data about Unspecialized.

467
00:35:57,620 --> 00:35:59,340
Unspecialized profession...

468
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,510
will definitely introduce an innovative shift to the league's dynamics.

469
00:36:03,510 --> 00:36:05,920
 That one. Can you put that... 

470
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,340
What are they doing?

471
00:36:07,340 --> 00:36:08,820
I was about to report to you.

472
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:11,180
The boss invited esports reporters to do an interview.

473
00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:13,020
This is the interview outline.

474
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:16,230
   

475
00:36:16,230 --> 00:36:18,240
   

476
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:19,913
   

477
00:36:19,913 --> 00:36:21,966
   

478
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:28,000
 Just a few days ago, 

479
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,280
 Excellent Era held a retirement ceremony for Ye Qiu. 

480
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:33,380
 It's a pity Grandmaster Ye Qiu did not appear at the scene 

481
00:36:33,380 --> 00:36:34,940
 to bid farewell to his fans. 

482
00:36:34,940 --> 00:36:38,460
 We interviewed Han Wenqing, the captain of Tyranny. 

483
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:41,500
 As Ye Qiu's old rival and friend, 

484
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:43,080
 what would he say? 

485
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:46,000
 What do you think about Ye Qiu's retirement? 

486
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:50,340
 Ye Qiu is not a person who would quit when he faces difficulties. 

487
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:52,440
 Since the first league tournament, 

488
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:55,380
 he has been an opponent that I have had to deal with carefully at all times. 

489
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:57,841
 I don't know why he chose to retire at this point. 

490
00:36:57,841 --> 00:37:01,060
 But I believe that he will return to the league. 

491
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:03,220
 You're saying that he's going to return to the league? 

492
00:37:03,220 --> 00:37:04,800
 Yes. 

493
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:08,120
 Because I didn't hear Ye Qiu say he will give up. 

494
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:11,680
 He must be somewhere else continuing 

495
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:13,620
 his fight for Glory. 

496
00:37:14,620 --> 00:37:17,580
He didn't say that he will give up.

497
00:37:21,620 --> 00:37:24,540
 You just said this was the result of the iteration of Excellent Era. 

498
00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:26,240
 Since the iteration is a total failure, 

499
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:29,300
 - why insist on doing it? 
 - Exactly! Why? 

500
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:30,750
 Ye Qiu is obviously still a top player. 

501
00:37:30,750 --> 00:37:31,960
 Why did you replace him with Sun Xiang? 

502
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:34,560
 All right! I'll give you an answer. 

503
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:37,660
 Actually, the reason why Ye Qiu retired 

504
00:37:37,660 --> 00:37:39,920
 and was replaced by Sun Xiang 

505
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:43,040
 was because it was his decision. 

506
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:45,860
 He was lying to us. 

507
00:37:45,860 --> 00:37:47,960
 How do you know that he has given up? 

508
00:37:50,780 --> 00:37:53,100
 Leaving doesn't count as giving up? 

509
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:04,340
 The cup is a vase now. 

510
00:38:04,340 --> 00:38:07,240
 Maybe he's taking a new path to start over. 

511
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:10,060
 Boss, what do you think? 

512
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:20,240
Ye Qiu will come back.

513
00:38:24,820 --> 00:38:26,860
He will come back for sure.

514
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:33,341
 Ye Qiu is not a person who would quit when he faces difficulties. 

515
00:38:33,341 --> 00:38:35,280
 Since the first league tournament, 

516
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:38,581
 he has been an opponent that I have had to deal with carefully at all times. 

517
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:42,620
 I don't know why he chose to retire at this point. 

518
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:44,760
 But I believe... 

519
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:47,280
What was Han Wenqing implying?

520
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:49,480
Use whatever means you can.

521
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:54,320
I don't want to see any news related to Ye Qiu ever again.

522
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:57,060
 He must be somewhere else continuing 

523
00:38:57,060 --> 00:38:58,880
 his fight for Glory. 

524
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:04,920
Have you seen Han Wenqing's interview?

525
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:08,420
Even he said that Ye Qiu would definitely return to the league.

526
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:13,040
And Ye Qiu never said that he would give up.

527
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:16,030
So we must believe that he is continuing his fight.

528
00:39:16,721 --> 00:39:20,300
I don't believe he would have any insurmountable obstacles.

529
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:23,740
He has always been a person who makes the impossible possible.

530
00:39:23,740 --> 00:39:26,400
Let's wait for him to come back!

531
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:40,140
   
   

532
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:44,330
   

533
00:39:56,190 --> 00:39:59,290
   

534
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:11,440
We'll wait for you to come back.

535
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:22,220
 No way! Master! 

536
00:40:22,220 --> 00:40:25,160
 You promised to help Blue Brook Guild reclaim the dungeon record for Line Canyon. 

537
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:27,620
 Why are you suddenly unable to do it? 

538
00:40:28,340 --> 00:40:31,380
 Don't ask me to help you break dungeon records again. 

539
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:35,120
 What happened? Who the hell bought you out? 

540
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:37,061
 I don't care. I can give you more items. 

541
00:40:37,061 --> 00:40:39,180
 Offer another price for the Line Canyon. 

542
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:41,560
 Blue Brook has to reclaim the record. 

543
00:40:42,660 --> 00:40:44,260
 A higher price won't make any difference. 

544
00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:47,239
 The service for raiding dungeons is also over. 

545
00:40:47,239 --> 00:40:48,820
 What? What? What? 

546
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:50,490
 Are you really giving up on those precious items? 

547
00:40:50,490 --> 00:40:52,800
 Are you going out of business? 

548
00:40:52,801 --> 00:40:56,500
 Master, you're not really retiring, are you? 

549
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:59,180
 You can't! You know Blue Brook guild wasn't involved with 

550
00:40:59,180 --> 00:41:02,060
 what happened in Congee Forest. 

551
00:41:02,060 --> 00:41:03,620
 I won't be boosting you again, 

552
00:41:03,620 --> 00:41:06,881
 but I can still get Blue Brook guild your first dungeon kill. 

553
00:41:06,881 --> 00:41:09,380
 Wait, hold up. Let me get this straight. 

554
00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:12,120
 You won't help us with the dungeons, 

555
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:14,900
 but you will continue helping us get new records? 

556
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:17,980
 Master, your logic doesn't make any sense. 

557
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:21,360
Please check to see if the revisions are okay.
