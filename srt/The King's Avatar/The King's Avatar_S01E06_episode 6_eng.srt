♫  Once it's disruptive, a decade of persistence won't be in vain  ♫

20

♫  Up on the clouds and down in the dust  ♫

♫  Fireflies making every effort to illuminate  ♫

22
00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:24,770
♫  Fireflies making every effort to illuminate  ♫

23
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:27,960
   

24
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:30,280
   

25
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:34,320
First of all, we should all be calm.

26
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,020
After attracting his main force,

27
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:38,420
we will surround the other four when the timing is right.

28
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:40,940
And then kill Su Mucheng and the other three.

29
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:42,040
Kill and win!

30
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,700
- Come on, come on, come on! 
 - Okay, let's go!

31
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:44,961
Be happy. Be happy.

32
00:01:44,961 --> 00:01:47,360
Remember, be happy!

33
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,640
Shaotian. Remember the strategy.

34
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,040
Don't worry. Consider it done.

35
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,460
 Players from both sides have entered the competition map. 

36
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:56,240
 The team competition between Team Excellent Era and Team Blue Rain will start right away! 

37
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,960
 Of the two strong and competitive teams, 

38
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,420
 Sun Xiang, Battlemage: One Autumn Leaf. 

39
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:01,380
 Yu Wenzhou, Warlock: Swoksaar. 

40
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:03,260
 Su Mucheng, Launcher: Dancing Rain. 

41
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:05,240
 Huang Shaotian, Blade Master: Troubling Rain. 

42
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:09,120
 So what kind of spark will these four star players create? 

43
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,420
 A showdown between two strong teams. 

44
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:11,700
 What's important may not be personal strength, 

45
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:12,840
 but teamwork. 

46
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,740
 Sun Xiang has already showcased his individual superior abilities. 

47
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:16,620
 How will he perform in the team competition? 

48
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:18,180
 One Autumn Leaf's Dragon Breaks the Ranks. 

49
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:19,620
 His momentum is unstoppable. 

50
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:21,480
 After knocking back the Spitfire Bullets Rain, 

51
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:23,200
 he aims directly at Warlock Swoksaar. 

52
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,300
 Bullets Rain stands up 

53
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:26,570
 and counters One Autumn Leaf's attack. 

54
00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:33,590
 Subtitles and Timing provided to you by💥🍥 TEAM 7️⃣ 🍥💥 @viki.com 

55
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:36,300
 This Heat-Seeking Missile outplayed two opponents. 

56
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:38,400
 On the other side, the Sword Saint Troubling Rain, 

57
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,920
 aims directly at Excellent Era's Sharpshooter. 

58
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:44,120
 Both sides chose to send assaulters to the back to disrupt the opponent. 

59
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:48,920
 Sun Xiang reacted very fast to counter. 

60
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:52,120
 Yu Wenzhou predicted well and pulled the Qi Master back. 

61
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:55,120
 He escaped from One Autumn Leaf's Draconic Crusher. 

62
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,700
 Sun's personal strength is strong. 

63
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:58,100
 He took control of the situation even when he was up against three players. 

64
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:00,640
 That's not what Blue Rain wants to see. 

65
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,680
 Yes, we see that the HP for both sides is now equal. 

66
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,300
 So if this stalemate continues, Blue Rain will lose. 

67
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:05,400
  The situation is really tense.  

68
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,000
 Blue Rain's Qi Master failed to protect the back row. 

69
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,800
 Swoksaar was still restrained by One Autumn Leaf. Nice! 

70
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:13,200
Rats.

71
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:16,440
 One Autumn Leaf hits Swoksaar with Double Stab. 

72
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,440
 Sun Xiang continues the momentum of the series match. 

73
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:20,180
 Sun Xiang, awesome! 

74
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:21,640
What "awesome"?

75
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:23,200
Unbox.

76
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:26,780
 Blue Rain needs to adjust their pace now. 

77
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:29,080
 Excellent Era is now pushing to put pressure on Blue Rain. 

78
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:31,080
 Excellent Era is now pushing to put pressure on Blue Rain. 

79
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,880
Excellent Era is going to lose.

80
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,300
Going to lose?

81
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:40,880
 Awesome! Wonderful! 

82
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:44,400
 We can see Sun Xiang is very brave and strong! 

83
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,680
Who did you say would lose?

84
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,480
 Maybe it'll be a lot worse. 

85
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:51,120
 Are we seeing correctly? 

86
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,760
 If Blue Rain is not able to adjust... 

87
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:55,120
You said Excellent Era is going to lose?

88
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,120
Are you kidding?

89
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,100
He has taken the limelight now.

90
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:02,280
No. Excellent Era is going to lose.

91
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,101
Why?

92
00:04:06,101 --> 00:04:08,520
Yu Wenzhou is using his signature strategy:

93
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,660
Box 1 Tactic.

94
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:16,760
Unbox!

95
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:20,360
 Will Blue Rain turn around to attack? 

96
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,120
Hello, Comrade Xiang!

97
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:24,040
The induction course begins.

98
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,260
Get ready to fight to the finish against me!

99
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:26,520
Are you fighting?

100
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:29,160
The account you are using now is divine One Autumn Leaf!

101
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,980
Could you show me Dragon Raising Its Head?

102
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:32,160
You can't do Dragon Raising its Head.

103
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,420
How do you deserve to own the account?

104
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:35,600
How do you?

105
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,600
So why don't you change your name: One Autumn Leaf Leaving?

106
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,860
Triple Slash, Cyclone Chopping.

107
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:41,380
Go up, go up! Triple Slash!

108
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:43,940
I was teasing you. Chop, chop, chop.

109
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:46,181
Sun Xiang, do you really have no dignity?

110
00:04:46,181 --> 00:04:47,900
The little weakling doesn't seem to be as dedicated as you are.

111
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:50,220
I'm sorry to say that to my little turtle...

112
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:51,181
Let me tell you something in secret.

113
00:04:51,181 --> 00:04:53,260
Your daddy is only using one hand right now.

114
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:56,720
One hand is not enough. I'm getting ready to kick.

115
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,880
Shut up! Stand still and don't move!

116
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,140
Let's see who'll lose.

117
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:03,160
Well, if you can, come after me.

118
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:05,260
You win if you can touch a single hair of mine.

119
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:06,720
What gave you such confidence?

120
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,620
I just finished one-against-three.

121
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:10,560
To be honest, the one-against-three match was a gift for you.

122
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,581
Look how boastful you are!

123
00:05:11,581 --> 00:05:13,760
The frog at the bottom of a well is better than you.

124
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:16,080
You know, when Daddy Ye won three consecutive championships,

125
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,440
you were still in kindergarten playing with clay.

126
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:21,500
So you should have known where you rank on the list.

127
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,120
I'll kill you!

128
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,960
 In fact, we all know that of all Blue Rain's tactics, 

129
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,920
 Huang Shaotian has never been the core. 

130
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:31,200
 But as an output core player, what should others do if you are boastful? 

131
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,660
 After losing the output point where One Autumn Leaf stood, 

132
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:35,700
 its team players are in an awkward situation. 

133
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:37,840
Captain, come back!

134
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:50,560
 The tacit understanding between Blue Rain players is extremely good. 

135
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,380
 Under the leadership of Swoksaar, 

136
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:56,680
 four Blue Rain players surrounded four Excellent Era players. 

137
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:58,200
 A war of position is on the way. 

138
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,240
 The situation is not good. 

139
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:01,720
 Excellent Era's players were hidden from view amidst various skill actions. 

140
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,460
 Su Mucheng is rapidly losing blood. 

141
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:06,740
 With Blue Rain's tactics, Troubling Rain has the role of harvesting. 

142
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:08,140
 Therefore, he is not the core of their tactics. 

143
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:11,680
 The current situation is what Blue Rain is willing to see. 

144
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,580
 Chaotic Rain, Swoksaar, and Yu Wenzhou 

145
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:16,000
 continue to suppress the blood volume of one another. 

146
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:24,880
 Except for One Autumn Leaf, 

147
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:28,380
 the blood volume of other Excellent Era players has dropped below 40%. 

148
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:30,181
 Director Li, is this Box 1 Tactic? 

149
00:06:30,181 --> 00:06:32,681
 That's right. It's exactly Box 1 Tactic. 

150
00:06:32,681 --> 00:06:35,940
How did you know Blue Rain would use that...

151
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:37,740
Box 1 Tactic?

152
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:40,050
Because he is Yu Wenzhou.

153
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:42,520
A dirty heart.

154
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:44,040
 Sun Xiang is still too young. 

155
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:46,240
 He has not figured out the strategy of the other side. 

156
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,461
 That's right. Yu Wenzhou is indeed a master tactician. 

157
00:06:48,461 --> 00:06:51,260
 At present, Blue Rain has great advantages. 

158
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,260
Return quickly!

159
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:01,440
 Excellent Era needs to stall for time. 

160
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,560
 They need to wait for the captain's return. 

161
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:08,160
 Now Excellent Era is leaderless. 

162
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,421
 In this situation, 

163
00:07:09,421 --> 00:07:11,560
 if no one can step up to take over the situation, 

164
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:15,880
 I think Excellent Era will lose the game. 

165
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,760
Now pay attention! Beheading!

166
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:19,340
Cleric coming to cover with Shield Qigong!

167
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:21,340
Perfect gun shooting! Strong treatment!

168
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:23,040
 - Understood. 
 - Understood. 

169
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:29,960
 After healing, his blood level is back. 

170
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:31,880
Air Hood!

171
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:36,741
 Good job! Dancing Rain is leading others to shoot intensively. 

172
00:07:36,741 --> 00:07:38,720
 They immediately killed the one with the lowest blood volume. 

173
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,480
 Guardian angel: Soul Speaker. 

174
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,460
 A 6th player is now in. 

175
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:43,980
 At the critical moment, Su Mucheng stepped up. 

176
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:48,621
 Nice counterattack! With such a disadvantage, she saved the situation. 

177
00:07:48,621 --> 00:07:49,900
6th player, fill the position quickly.

178
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:51,200
Song Xiao, outflank!

179
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,260
Don't let Su Mucheng break through.

180
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:54,000
The rest of you stay put. Get ready to unbox.

181
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,440
Okay.

182
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:59,200
Seal!

183
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,720
 It's a curse arrow. 

184
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:02,940
 Swoksaar is beginning to sing. 

185
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:05,640
 Excellent Era's blood volume is already very low. 

186
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:11,700
 Quadra Kill! Incredible cooperation! 

187
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:13,040
 Meanwhile, count the damage. 

188
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:15,480
 Four were killed in the blink of an eye. 

189
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:17,160
 Excellent Erai has performed very well in the front. 

190
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:20,640
 Without One Autumn Leaf, Dancing Rain could lead others and kill one. 

191
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:22,240
 Su Mucheng performed well! 

192
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,220
 Aced! The 6th player is not in his position. 

193
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:27,960
 One Autumn Leaf is in danger! Excellent Era is in danger! 

194
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:30,520
 Okay, Blue Rain has joined with Troubling Rain. 

195
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:34,080
 One Autumn Leaf is facing a one-against-four situation. 

196
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,700
My dear comrades, if you can't understand such a simple tactic,

197
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:38,940
you should amputate everything below your eyebrows.

198
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:40,720
So you should go back to your kindergarten class.

199
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:43,220
Now you know the gap between you and Daddy Ye.

200
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:45,200
But Master Huang doesn't mind continuing the class for a while.

201
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,240
I'll give you one last lesson.

202
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:49,720
It's about how to behave as a human.

203
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:51,140
Three.

204
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:52,100
Two.

205
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:53,560
One.

206
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:02,640
 One Autumn Leaf was killed just like that. 

207
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,500
 Now, Excellent Era has a 6th player left. 

208
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,860
 Excellent Era's 6th player has just arrived. But it's too late. 
   

209
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:08,660
 - Blue Rain conveniently killed the 6th player. 
 - Yes! 

210
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:10,760
 Congratulations, Blue Rain! 

211
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:12,780
 They won! 
   

212
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:14,580
 At the same time, they destroyed Excellent Era. 

213
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:17,720
 Yes, Blue Rain, who didn't have a good start, beautifully turned the tables and won the game! 

214
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:22,200
 Due to the extra points for eliminating the entire team, Blue Rain won! 

215
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:29,140
They played in a dirty way.

216
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:36,160
Next, we welcome the players from the two teams

217
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,440
to shake hands and receive your applause.

218
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:46,340
Little Classmate, your daddy will always be your master.

219
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:48,360
Little Sister Su, pay attention to your diet.

220
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,860
Eat less.

221
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:51,780
Come on, congratulations.

222
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:53,920
Great! Keep working hard.

223
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:56,320
 Let's see each other next weekend. 

224
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,120
 Bye-bye. 

225
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:01,480
Yu Wenzhou is really awesome.

226
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:07,080
With a team competition, he bounced back all of a sudden.

227
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:09,220
Starting with Sun Xiang's one-against-three,

228
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:10,900
it was all Yu Wenzhou's strategy.

229
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:13,440
What?

230
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,860
Is there a strategy of letting the opponent win?

231
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:18,720
One-against-three is very exhausting.

232
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,360
Sun Xiang was filled with extreme arrogance.

233
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,520
In a group war,

234
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:26,060
as long as Huang Shaotian moved even slightly, Sun Xiang would explode.

235
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:31,120
Yu Wenzhou was ready. Just waiting for the ace.

236
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,920
I haven't seen you for a few days, I should look at you with special respect.

237
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:36,120
I admire you!

238
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:39,680
Network Manager, where's the beer?

239
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:41,700
Over there.

240
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:45,800
Looks like our network manager remembers the map of the net cafe?

241
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,580
Enough is enough.

242
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:49,000
You're doing this on purpose.

243
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,820
Hey, wait a minute.

244
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:52,420
Ye Xiu, aren't you going to attack the dungeon now?

245
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:53,700
Have you found anyone?

246
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:54,500
Not yet.

247
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:57,380
Ask him. He is a swordsman.

248
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:00,020
Thank you, Boss.

249
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:03,920
But... my swordsman will come to me.

250
00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:13,520
   

251
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:18,020
Why is that guy so sneaky?

252
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:19,161
Something's wrong with him.

253
00:11:19,161 --> 00:11:20,600
Let's go.

254
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:04,281
Hello, hello.

255
00:12:04,281 --> 00:12:06,000
Handsome guy.

256
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,220
May I ask if there is a network manager here whose last name is Ye?

257
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:09,360
Is there?

258
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:13,600
And his name is like... the captain.... No, the former captain of Excellent Era.

259
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,800
Could you ask him to come here?

260
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:19,260
Hey, Big Brother, could you answer me? Do a guy a favor.

261
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:23,240
I'm new. Not familiar.

262
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:26,680
Such short answers! Cool!

263
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:31,261
I see. Did that Ye make you angry?

264
00:12:31,261 --> 00:12:32,920
It's okay. I know him very well.

265
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:36,620
He's afraid of me. You ask him to come here. I'll teach him a lesson.

266
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,440
Teach him a lesson.

267
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:42,740
Who are you?

268
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:46,320
Who am I? I am Huang Shao...

269
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:50,240
What about you, handsome guy?

270
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,280
I can understand how you feel.

271
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:56,880
Although it's said old Ye is mean, bad-mouthed, and boastful,

272
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,800
he is actually as miserable as he looks.

273
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,320
So don't be angry at him.

274
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:08,080
Huang Shao...

275
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,860
First, log in. Log in. For two hours.

276
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:12,280
Ye Qiu! I'm telling you, you're not a gentleman.

277
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:14,200
You have changed, Ye Qiu. You didn't treat me like this before.

278
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,440
Could you be a little more gentle with me?

279
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:19,340
Okay, if you don't apologize to me... I'm leaving. Bye

280
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:27,280
 Wasn't old Ye a captain before? 

281
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,920
 Now look at how pitiful he is. 

282
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:31,680
 Forget it. I won't hold grudges against him. 

283
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:33,600
Old Ye,

284
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,880
are you really determined to work as a network manager?

285
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:38,000
Wasn't that decision too hasty?

286
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,640
Although you're still using the keyboard,

287
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:42,200
a calculator keyboard can't compete with our keyboard.

288
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,760
Don't forget you were once a king.

289
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:47,060
And why did you retire secretly?

290
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:48,840
Is there any hidden secret?

291
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:51,920
Or did they bully you, use you, and dump you?

292
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,800
So you had internal conflicts.

293
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:57,600
If you talk any more nonsense, I'll throw you into the trash can.

294
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,840
Old Ye! How could you treat me like this?

295
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,480
Okay! Then, why did you ask me to come?

296
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,420
I, Sword Saint, don't have any free time.

297
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:06,820
My schedule is full of training every single day!

298
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:10,680
If it weren't for our friendship, who'd listen to your mean words?

299
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:12,280
Don't you feel a little warmth?

300
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:15,000
Can't you satisfy my curiosity?

301
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,220
Well...

302
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:19,980
If you really want to know, there is a way.

303
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:22,600
I'd do anything for you.

304
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:34,140
Quickly, tell me the password.

305
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:35,540
"Ye Qiu is the most invincibly handsome."

306
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:38,220
I asked for the password. Why are you boasting?

307
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,820
"Ye Qiu is the most invincibly handsome."

308
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:41,960
Enough is enough.

309
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,360
I'm the only one who would tolerate it.

310
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:46,541
Come on, did you hear me? Shame on you.

311
00:14:46,541 --> 00:14:50,760
This is the password. Believe it or not.

312
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:52,850
   

313
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:58,160
Old Ye, you have really fallen this low.

314
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,740
You know... I am embarrassed to say it.

315
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:02,020
How could that be the password?

316
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:04,560
When did you become so childish? I'm laughing so hard my face hurts.

317
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,640
Are you done laughing?

318
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,780
If you are, sit up.

319
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:10,040
Isn't this just a Dungeon?

320
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:11,640
I can do this with my eyes closed.

321
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:14,480
You just said the record for Boneyard is ridiculously high.

322
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,600
Who is so boring?

323
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:20,861
It's Excellent Era again.

324
00:15:20,861 --> 00:15:23,220
Your relationship with Excellent Era has deteriorated so far.

325
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:26,720
You retired. Are they still chasing you in Glory?

326
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,200
Wait.

327
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:32,950
Based on your personality, you must have offended them again. Right?

328
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:36,180
Are you going to help me or not?

329
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:38,520
Who is the captain?

330
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,320
Sun Xiang.

331
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:44,900
Okay, then. It turns out that I didn't have enough fun in the alliance.

332
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:47,460
Daddy Huang would like to teach him a lesson again.

333
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:49,480
Pass me the account card.

334
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:53,740
Watch how Daddy will defeat him and take away all his dignity.

335
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:56,180
   
   

336
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:59,760
No way! A 27-level Swordsman?

337
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:01,820
The worst of the worst. How can I do it?

338
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:03,561
I'd lose my dignity if anyone found out. What a shame!

339
00:16:03,561 --> 00:16:05,621
- Feeling guilty? 
 - You...

340
00:16:05,621 --> 00:16:10,060
There is no such word as "guilty" in my dictionary, but...

341
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:14,160
five of Excellent Era's professional players are on the other side.

342
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,580
Will the two of us...

343
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:20,110
I just knew you'd have a strategy.

344
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:22,980
   
   

345
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:25,160
But why is one missing?

346
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:27,000
Who is the fifth one?

347
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:30,780
They probably haven't confirmed it yet.

348
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:43,420
 Hello, Little Sister Su, guess who this is? Did you miss me? 

349
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:46,300
 I've come to visit old Ye. Come and have some fun with us when you're free. 

350
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:47,800
 By the way, have any inside info? 

351
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,980
 - Why is Excellent Era so lousy? 
 - Step aside. 

352
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:52,620
 Mucheng, enter the Dungeon at 3:00. 

353
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,400
Mucheng...

354
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,020
The captain asked you to hold the replay meeting in the seminar room.

355
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:02,841
When?

356
00:17:02,841 --> 00:17:04,440
Now.

357
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:13,970
   
   

358
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:19,680
Why hasn't Little Sister Su come yet?

359
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,920
Excellent Era is not far from here.

360
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:24,160
Women are always dawdling.

361
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,840
She is never late.

362
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:27,960
I would guess that something came up.

363
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:36,530
   

364
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:43,380
She's not coming?

365
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:46,541
What should we do? We need one more.

366
00:17:46,541 --> 00:17:48,580
Who?

367
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:49,920
I contacted someone in the Blue Brook Guild.

368
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:53,120
Which one from the Blue Brook Guild?

369
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,100
Master of the Blue Brook Guild's10th Server.

370
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:56,760
The guild master?

371
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:00,520
Is he reliable?

372
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:03,340
You're not that famous. It should be fine.

373
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:05,200
What a joke. I'm not famous?

374
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:10,240
- Listen. I'm very... 
 - You're afraid of Yu Wenzhou? Everyone knows it.

375
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:13,800
No, I mean I keep it low-key to avoid public panic.

376
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,640
But...

377
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:17,640
Old Ye, tell me the truth.

378
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:21,100
Will he keep it a secret? Will he bring trouble to me?

379
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,440
Take a guess.

380
00:18:27,890 --> 00:18:29,960
Then I'd better be quiet.

381
00:18:36,890 --> 00:18:39,600
   
   

382
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:49,660
If there is no problem, you can enter in ten seconds.

383
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:52,320
Start.

384
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:57,480
Blue River increase output.

385
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:59,540
Soft Mist, pay attention to the cooling time.

386
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:01,280
Bao Zi, shoot more accurately.

387
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,000
Make a way with flowing water. I'll eliminate all monsters.

388
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,600
Stay close. Push ahead with all strength.

389
00:19:18,530 --> 00:19:21,230
   

390
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:53,720
Old Ye, we can't take any advantage of anything.

391
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:55,240
After all, the two rookies are not skilled.

392
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:57,120
But Excellent Era sent professional players.

393
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,720
What should I do?

394
00:20:15,370 --> 00:20:18,300
   

395
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:10,920
   

396
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,720
Old Ye, we can't fight like this.

397
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:15,860
What should I do? We're running out of time. Think of something.

398
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:20,001
What? What the heck are you throwing?

399
00:21:20,001 --> 00:21:21,720
Stop attacking.

400
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:24,480
Throw all the monsters in the air as fast as you can.

401
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:25,330
Stick them in cracks in the rock.

402
00:21:25,330 --> 00:21:28,080
The strike time will be reduced by 4 seconds.

403
00:21:28,081 --> 00:21:31,900
Killing monsters is not the goal; winning is.

404
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:02,800
   
   

405
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,500
 The Dungeon record is so bad! 

406
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:06,980
 Lord Grim is an attacking machine? 

407
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:08,440
 They are making new Dungeon records in turns! 

408
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:10,420
 Today, it's Blue Brook Guild players again. 

409
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:12,420
  Blue Brook Guild is the most powerful in Glory. 

410
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:13,920
 We should apply to join it. 

411
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:17,040
 Blue Brook Guild is shameless! 

412
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:18,720
 They always ask pros to help them. 

413
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,700
 - Who doesn't ask for help? 
 - Exactly! 

414
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:23,060
 Such a shameless guild should be expelled from District 10! 

415
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:25,460
 Ban Blue Brook Guild from summoning Lord Grim, the master of Dungeons! 

416
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:28,100
 Maybe all guilds are fighting for Lord Grim. 

417
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:30,960
 With the master joining them, they'll get new records. 

418
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:34,500
 Congratulations to the 10th server players: Lord Grim, Flowing Tree,  

419
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:37,720
 Steamed Bun Invasion, Soft Mist, and Blue River. 

420
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:39,780
 They broke the record for Boneyard. 

421
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:43,700
 The time is 16 minutes 24.67 seconds. 

422
00:22:58,780 --> 00:22:59,960
Yes!

423
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:01,560
Our Blue Brook Guild has won again!

424
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:03,940
That was a great performance!

425
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:05,660
Crazy again?

426
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:09,800
Come and see my master's great performance.

427
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:11,160
The record was broken again?

428
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:12,860
- Amazing! 
 - How did this happen?

429
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:15,121
Look. They stuck the monsters in stone cracks.

430
00:23:15,121 --> 00:23:17,120
On average, four seconds are reduced when fighting monsters.

431
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:18,520
Awesome, right?

432
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:19,800
Look!

433
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:21,980
Weapons capable of changing forms?

434
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:24,140
This is the peak of Glory, isn't it?

435
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:30,600
From today on, this person belongs to our Blue Brook Guild.

436
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:33,600
 - Yes! 
 - Yes! 

437
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:39,520
 Yesterday, in the 8th round of Glory Pro League, 

438
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,900
 Excellent Era was defeated by a Blue Rain team. 

439
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:43,510
 More details coming up. 

440
00:23:43,510 --> 00:23:44,540
   

441
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:45,920
I think they are targeting us.

442
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,880
That's right.

443
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:53,840
Recently, we have performed poorly in several competitions.

444
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,500
Should we do some replays?

445
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:56,360
- Yes. 
 - Yes.

446
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:58,300
You guys were the ones who performed badly.

447
00:23:58,300 --> 00:23:59,820
It has nothing to do with me.

448
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:02,740
The Excellent Era team and the Captain of Excellent Era are always viewed as a whole.

449
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:05,140
Not now.

450
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:10,540
   

451
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:11,870
When I was soloing with others in the front,

452
00:24:11,870 --> 00:24:13,750
what were you doing back there?

453
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:17,480
Only if I kicked away all Blue Rain players could you win.

454
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:19,980
If it weren't for the points I gained by one-against-three,

455
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:22,860
what could you bring to Excellent Era?

456
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:24,820
The four of us...

457
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:29,060
fighting against one of them...

458
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:35,440
It's you guys who should be reflecting on yourselves.

459
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:39,920
How can he...

460
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:43,280
He's already got all the limelight.

461
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:46,400
 Congratulations to the 10th server players: Lord Grim, 

462
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:49,180
 Flowing Tree, Steamed Bun Invasion, Soft Mist, and Blue River. 

463
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:50,530
 They broke the record of Boneyard. 

464
00:24:50,530 --> 00:24:53,460
How is it possible?

465
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:14,900
All right, I've helped you attack Dungeons.

466
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:16,121
The record is broken.

467
00:25:16,121 --> 00:25:17,540
I've done so many things for you.

468
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:21,260
Could you share some inside info about you and Excellent Era?

469
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:22,360
What would you like to drink?

470
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:23,920
Don't worry about that. I see.

471
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:25,800
Let me guess what you want to drink now.

472
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:28,020
What about soda?  Do you like it?

473
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:30,400
No?

474
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,660
Is it because you were bitterly disappointed

475
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:34,540
so you could only give up in tears?

476
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:37,460
How about this?

477
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:43,220
Wait. It's sour. Not suitable for your bitter mood.

478
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:45,380
Freshly brewed coffee?

479
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:50,300
You mean the mean guys in Excellent Era kicked you out and didn't want you anymore?

480
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:51,500
They used you.

481
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:54,760
That's why you left, right?

482
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:57,120
There are many people here at the cafe.

483
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:01,060
People will recognize your voice, so don't expose your identity as Blade Master.

484
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:03,460
But tell me, did I guess...

485
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:07,480
Well, now you're looking down on my identity.

486
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:10,541
I'm leaving now. Don't you regret it!

487
00:26:10,541 --> 00:26:12,780
Okay. Goodbye.

488
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:19,580
So...

489
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:21,740
Your bark is much worse than your bite.

490
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:24,900
So you won't treat me badly, will you?

491
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:28,160
¥10 for the internet and ¥20 for coffee.

492
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,540
Thank you for your cooperation.

493
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:32,800
You're forcing me to pay? I didn't even drink it.

494
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:37,700
You deserve the best. Now, pay the bill.

495
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:42,300
You are so mean!

496
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:44,160
I'm really broke now.

497
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:46,940
I'll give you the money. I will.

498
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:55,840
Do you know that you are being extremely disgusting?

499
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:57,460
In the future, we should part ways.

500
00:26:57,460 --> 00:26:59,700
Don't take the same road as me.

501
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:01,460
If I come to see you again, I'll take your last name!

502
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:03,240
Farewell!

503
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:10,620
Three, two, one.

504
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:14,980
Hey. Ye Shaotian is back.

505
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:18,760
No, I came for my change, not for you.

506
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:22,600
Why don't you buy more drinks for 70¥?

507
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:26,010
No, I want you...

508
00:27:29,310 --> 00:27:31,600
to take a walk with me.

509
00:27:33,250 --> 00:27:36,370
   

510
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:52,520
Old Ye.

511
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:54,160
Old Ye...

512
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:57,590
do you know what your retirement actually means?

513
00:27:58,100 --> 00:27:59,840
I don't.

514
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:01,481
You know?

515
00:28:01,481 --> 00:28:03,000
You don't know?

516
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,640
Retiring means that in a year,

517
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:06,540
if you want to rely on your previous fame to come back,

518
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:07,820
no team will ever recruit you again.

519
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:09,860
Only convenience stores will greet you: "Welcome"!

520
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:11,560
Do you understand?

521
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:13,460
You don't know.

522
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:15,190
That makes sense.

523
00:28:15,190 --> 00:28:19,020
Working in a 24/7 convenience store would be my only consolation.

524
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:20,860
Ye Qiu, stop.

525
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:22,900
I'm talking to you very seriously now.

526
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:24,500
You once told me something.

527
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:27,220
A veteran in Glory like you should cherish every second and minute.

528
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:28,540
But what are you doing now?

529
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:30,040
If you waste a whole year...

530
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:32,300
your hands will not know how to use your skills.

531
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:35,300
Every day now is even more precious to me.

532
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:40,260
I want to finish something I must do.

533
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:42,660
But I've never had a chance to do it.

534
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:45,540
What is it?

535
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:50,400
I had a good friend.

536
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:52,180
If he were still alive,

537
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:55,120
he would surely be one of the greatest masters in Glory.

538
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:57,860
He created a work of genius.

539
00:28:57,860 --> 00:29:01,040
Are you talking about your umbrella?

540
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:03,740
Yes.

541
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:07,160
I'd like to revive the Myriad Manifestation Umbrella.

542
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:11,520
With it, I will add more excitement to Glory.

543
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:13,400
Wait! What did you say?

544
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:17,080
Add more excitement to Glory?

545
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:19,940
Glory veterans like me...

546
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:22,080
should cherish every single day.

547
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:24,740
And every single second.

548
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:27,220
Don't waste any time.

549
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:29,980
Really? Say that again?

550
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,300
I am a professional player.

551
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:40,660
Old Ye, you've got a detailed plan to return. Right?

552
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:43,300
What do you think?

553
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:44,940
Ye Qiu!

554
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:47,820
Welcome!

555
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:56,440
I look forward to seeing you next time.

556
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:00,740
I just knew it! You wouldn't...

557
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:02,240
leave so easily...

558
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,580
   

559
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:06,320
Wait just a minute.

560
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:14,000
Is your Captain Yu Wenzhou looking for you?

561
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:23,660
Quick, answer it. If you don't, something bad will happen.

562
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:25,340
What are you talking about? What could happen?

563
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:26,560
I'm telling you, don't underestimate me.

564
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:30,200
I'm proving my position to you right now by being here.

565
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:32,890
So...

566
00:30:32,890 --> 00:30:35,800
You didn't slip out of the hotel by going through the fire escape?

567
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:38,001
That's right. I escaped through the staff entrance.

568
00:30:38,001 --> 00:30:39,520
And...

569
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:46,100
I'm trying to keep a low profile.

570
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:50,400
Actually, it's good to be afraid of the captain.

571
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:53,080
Me afraid? Who would I be afraid of?

572
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:55,060
You don't believe it, do you? Just wait.

573
00:30:55,060 --> 00:30:56,400
My unruly soul...

574
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:59,180
will make great achievements sooner or later!

575
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:04,180
Wait! Wait!

576
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:33,060
Old Ye, do you think... this scene feels a little familiar?

577
00:31:42,830 --> 00:31:45,460
   

578
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:56,640
 Take a look over here. 

579
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,580
 Catch that unruly guy! 

580
00:31:58,580 --> 00:32:00,020
 He's got nerve! 

581
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:02,080
 How dare he escape from the training camp? 

582
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:03,280
 Look here! 

583
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:04,161
 Anything? 

584
00:32:04,161 --> 00:32:05,460
 No. 

585
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:06,481
 Anything over there? 

586
00:32:06,481 --> 00:32:07,660
 Nothing here. 

587
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:09,580
 - Come on, let's search over there. 
 - Okay. 

588
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:11,920
 We must catch him today. 

589
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:13,680
 He's too bold. 

590
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:15,040
 Okay. 

591
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:34,620
 Teacher Ye, why are you here? 

592
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:36,180
 Are you here to help me? 

593
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:39,980
 Isn't helping your students the duty of every teacher? 

594
00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:43,420
 Awesome. Thank you! 

595
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:45,640
 What's going on over there? 

596
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:47,140
 Go over there and take a look. 

597
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:48,660
 Okay. 

598
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:55,270
   

599
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:13,900
 Did you see that? If it were not me... 

600
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:15,700
 you would be done for. 

601
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:19,020
 Teacher Ye, you are really a good person. 

602
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:21,100
 I've known for a while that you were different from other teachers at the training camp. 

603
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:22,480
 Look how tall and majestic you are! 

604
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:24,080
 Full of the brilliance of human nature! 

605
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:25,500
 Especially that Teacher Han... 

606
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:28,540
 He's so mean! As ruthless as a Tyrannosaurus Rex. 

607
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:30,460
 Do you think... 

608
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:36,040
  Teacher Ye... 

609
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:38,260
 From now on, I'll be vigilant against fire, theft, and protect teachers. 

610
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:41,280
 I am not afraid of them at all! Believe me. 

611
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:45,520
 My unruly soul... will make great achievements sooner or later. 

612
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:21,420
But with this, you've done something very brave!

613
00:34:21,420 --> 00:34:24,460
You'd rather sacrifice yourself to protect your students.

614
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:26,900
But if I remember correctly...

615
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:31,400
our dear Teacher Ye, for the next two months,

616
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:34,100
was wearing a plaster cast while he was teaching.

617
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:39,700
You want to know how it feels wearing a plaster cast?

618
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:43,080
Stop! Stop!

619
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:04,670
 It should be faster. 

620
00:35:04,670 --> 00:35:06,940
 The explosion should be faster. 

621
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:10,320
 Right. I'll find a way. 

622
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:14,660
 You could try this. 

623
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:22,460
You are here, Shaotian.

624
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:24,660
 - Let's go and train.  
 - Captain.

625
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:26,420
Why did you call me so late?

626
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:29,021
You're all here. What's up? I was asleep.

627
00:35:29,021 --> 00:35:31,540
Let me show you a video. Blue River just sent it.

628
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:33,960
The Dungeon record for the 10th server.

629
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:38,600
Why should we look at it?

630
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:41,100
Captain, I don't know why... I can fall asleep so easily...

631
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:43,320
Maybe it's what my body needs. Could I look at it tomorrow?

632
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:44,740
Good night. Good night.

633
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:48,100
You did not answer the phone in your room, right?

634
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:50,000
I did.

635
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,400
Captain, you know... I like watching TV while I fall asleep.

636
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:53,710
So there might be some odd noises.

637
00:35:53,710 --> 00:35:55,980
Tonight, I'll try falling asleep without turning the TV on.

638
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:59,900
It seems like we'll have to talk about this TV issue tomorrow.

639
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:03,700
I think we shouldn't put it off until tomorrow.

640
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:06,700
In this technical room, it's better if we talk about more serious things.

641
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:08,360
What Dungeon were you just talking about, Captain?

642
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:11,000
- Boneyard. 
 - Boneyard?

643
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,160
The record time was 16 minutes 24.67 seconds.

644
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:15,180
That's definitely abnormal!

645
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:16,560
Indeed, it was fast.

646
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:18,900
But a new strategy appeared in it.

647
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:21,400
A Swordsman and an Unspecialized worked together.

648
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:26,641
- Does that sound familiar? 
 - No.

649
00:36:26,641 --> 00:36:29,520
We don't have any Unspecialized, do we? Is anyone here a Freelancer?

650
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:32,200
But we have Swordsmen, right?

651
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:35,200
You! The Swordsman! You performed well as a Berserker?

652
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:37,460
You want me to worry? For here, there's the triple slash.

653
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:40,401
Now, it's a quintuple slash! You don't get it? Idiot!

654
00:36:40,401 --> 00:36:42,740
Every day, all you care about is eating.

655
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:47,600
   

656
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:52,800
Come on. You really are an idiot!

657
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,920
Captain, what were you saying?

658
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:56,760
Talking about this. Look...

659
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:59,840
Falling Light Blade and Gatling Gun worked together smoothly.

660
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:01,800
The cooperation between the two men is very smooth.

661
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:04,900
- They must have known each other for a long time. 
 - True.

662
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:06,600
Look at this guy. His name is...

663
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:08,300
Steamed Bun Invasion!

664
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:10,900
What a name! He should work with a dumpling.

665
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:12,660
The two of them can make breakfast.

666
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:15,440
- I am not talking about this person. I'm talking about Soft... 
 - Soft Mist?

667
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:17,940
This name sounds enlightening.

668
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:20,000
But I seriously suspect it could be a man...

669
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,100
How do you pronounce these two words?

670
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:28,640
Flowing Tree, this must be a grandmaster!

671
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:31,260
And I'm sure he's weak! He must be a lousy player.

672
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:33,840
On the contrary, that dumpling, he could be great.

673
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:35,560
I don't think so.

674
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:36,900
You don't?

675
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:40,220
I think Flowing Tree, as a Swordsman...

676
00:37:40,220 --> 00:37:44,600
seized every opportunity the Unspecialized created.

677
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:46,800
From this point of view...

678
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,500
He is an opportunist.

679
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:53,820
I have only seen that in one person...

680
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:57,740
Don't you think it's very similar to you?

681
00:37:59,180 --> 00:38:01,700
Is it?

682
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:06,400
Isn't it?

683
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:14,220
He must be a fan of mine. They were mimicking my strategy.

684
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:16,660
Captain, I know why you asked me here so late at night.

685
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:18,920
I will not be surpassed by them. You don't need to worry.

686
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:21,841
I will work hard. Believe me, okay?

687
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:26,700
This fan is you, right?

688
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:32,180
Confess.

689
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:56,220
Sit closer.

690
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:03,900
Closer still.

691
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:12,700
Three, two...

692
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:18,900
- Am I that scary? 
 - No.

693
00:39:19,540 --> 00:39:22,020
- About the TV thing... 
 - Captain, I did it only this one time...

694
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:24,741
- I think... 
 - I will not ask about that.

695
00:39:26,641 --> 00:39:30,020
Really? Captain, you're so kind!

696
00:39:30,020 --> 00:39:32,480
Sorry. You have a bigger heart than I do! I was too excited.

697
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:34,900
You must tell me honestly about what I want to know.

698
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:37,100
Okay, okay. Don't worry.

699
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:40,360
- The Unspecialized you were with... What weapon was he using? 
 - An umbrella.

700
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:41,520
- What's its name?  
 - Myriad Manifestation Umbrella.

701
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:43,821
- Specs? 
 - Attacking speed: 5; silver weapon level.

702
00:39:43,821 --> 00:39:44,980
Although there are no special specs...

703
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:46,500
it covers almost all forms of professions.

704
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:47,780
How is Ye Qiu these days?

705
00:39:47,780 --> 00:39:49,600
He is now working as...

706
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,740
I don't know much about it.

707
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:55,980
Lord Grim is Ye Qiu, right?

708
00:39:55,980 --> 00:39:57,820
Is he?

709
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:01,460
Isn't he?

710
00:40:01,460 --> 00:40:02,920
Yes...

711
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:06,300
Do I need to continue asking?

712
00:40:09,180 --> 00:40:10,900
Captain, it's like this... He started it.

713
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:12,920
He asked me to attack the Dungeon with him...

714
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:15,621
I said no. Then he threatened and tempted me...

715
00:40:15,621 --> 00:40:17,940
Then he said he wanted to finish something that wasn't yet complete;

716
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:19,120
revive some sort of umbrella.

717
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:21,260
And he said he would add some excitement to Glory...

718
00:40:21,260 --> 00:40:24,120
- I told him not to do it... 
 - Wait a minute.

719
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:26,220
He really said that?

720
00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:28,740
His words were like this.

721
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:38,200
"I will add more excitement to Glory."

722
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:42,020
That's what he said. He was serious.

723
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:46,000
I'd be Sun Xiang if I'm lying... I'm telling the truth.

724
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,900
Sorry, Old Ye.

725
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:50,500
You had time to attack Dungeons after the competition.

726
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:53,500
It seems that you don't get enough training.

727
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:56,000
Captain, did you just say we'd turn over a new leaf?

728
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,800
- You'll keep your promise, right? 
 - No.

729
00:40:59,380 --> 00:41:01,981
- Unless... 
 - Unless what?

730
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:04,800
Go find a Myriad Manifestation Umbrella.

731
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:06,540
Isn't that stealing...

732
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:10,360
Captain, isn't that a bit shameless?

733
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:12,760
Look. Blue Rain has always been aboveboard.

734
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:15,861
- Is it... 
 - How can this be shameless?

735
00:41:15,861 --> 00:41:18,800
We'll just borrow it for research purposes.

736
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:21,900
We will return it when it's done.

737
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:24,560
By the way, you may not be able to beat him.

738
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:27,020
Captain, you should be responsible for what you say.

739
00:41:27,020 --> 00:41:28,340
I can't beat him?

740
00:41:28,340 --> 00:41:29,860
Listen to me. With my current abilities,

741
00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:32,560
I could beat his umbrella into a stick in minutes.

742
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:34,920
Three hours. I'll wait for you.

743
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:37,850
Only three hours?

744
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:50,200
 When will you finish that training camp competition with me, 

745
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:53,310
 Ye Qiu. Master.
