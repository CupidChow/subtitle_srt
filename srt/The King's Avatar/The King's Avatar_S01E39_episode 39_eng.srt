1
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:32,480
 

2
00:01:33,713 --> 00:01:37,200
Jia Shi assigned Su Mu Cheng
on the last round of Arena Contest.

3
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,680
The league's top Launcher
versus the master of first generation.

4
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:43,480
It's a battle between gunpowder and magic.

5
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:45,320
How will the Arena Contest end?

6
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:49,280
We'll see in the game.

7
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:52,440
Some tactical adjustments were made on the spot.

8
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:54,120
It's normal.

9
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:56,560
Be cool about it.

10
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:02,400
Since Mu Cheng is wearing Jia Shi's uniform
sitting on Jia Shi's player seat,

11
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:07,760
it means that you're ready to fight for Jia Shi.

12
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,760
Don't think too much.

13
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:29,200
Mr. Tao, you're putting her in a dilemma.

14
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,240
You choose Mu Cheng
to play in such a sensitive match,

15
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:34,680
she would be suspected
even though she wants to win

16
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,680
but just lose the game normally.

17
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:41,360
Then play well if she doesn't want that.

18
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,200
But when it comes to games like this,

19
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,120
if you dig out the details with preconceived,

20
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:50,720
any operation that isn't in place
will be seemed as intentional.

21
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:56,480
She has only one option, win.

22
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,960
That's just what we want.

23
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,960
The last Arena Contest,

24
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:08,080
Jia Shi assigned the top Launcher, Su Mu Cheng,
to challenge the veteran,

25
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,720
Wei Chen, the winner of last round.

26
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,600
Captain Yu, what do you think of this game?

27
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:15,360
Both teams' players are experienced and mature.

28
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,560
They both know each other well.

29
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,960
And they operate long-handed professions
that are good at long-distance consumption.

30
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:22,280
This could have been a close game.

31
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:24,400
But Captain Wei lost nearly half
of his blood last round,

32
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,361
and has consumed too much HP,

33
00:03:25,361 --> 00:03:26,960
this should be a tough fight for him.

34
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,120
Well, we all know that

35
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:30,080
Su Mu Cheng didn't renew her contract
with Jia Shi,

36
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,320
it is said that they may not cooperate.

37
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:35,200
But Jia Shi assigned her
in such a crucial competition,

38
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,360
we have no idea what the tactical arrangement
of the Jia Shi Team is.

39
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,240
Game begins.

40
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:41,120
There seems to be a change
in the style of Dancing Rain.

41
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,200
Sister Su didn't start like her style at all.

42
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,440
Why did Su Mu Cheng move completely differen
from before?

43
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,120
She's not really going to let him win, right?

44
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,280
No, she won't.

45
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:51,040
Don't give up your professional honor
for helping Ye Qiu.

46
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,440
I'm just saying that women aren't good enough.

47
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:55,560
She's just not tough enough.

48
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,240
Dancing Rain keeps moving her position
to find the opponent,

49
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:02,360
Windward Formation keeps quiet,
he did not rush out.

50
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:04,720
Windward Formation's HP is in great disadvantage,

51
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,400
it's right to choose a more conservative way.

52
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,080
Dancing Rain mounted gun.

53
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,600
Captain Yu, how do you evaluate
the opening of Su Mu Cheng's blocking?

54
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:13,960
The style of her blocking has really changed.

55
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:17,440
She no longer makes long-distance outflank,
but in a more aggressive way.

56
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,400
We can see that Windward Formation begins
to move his position.

57
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,040
He's finding Dancing Rain's position.

58
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,720
Su Mu Cheng still occupies a high place,
she has a very wide vision.

59
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,240
But she's easy to be discovered.

60
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,440
They are all long-distance professions.

61
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:30,320
It is better to find the opponent first
and hold the upper hand.

62
00:04:32,991 --> 00:04:35,280
Windward Formation seems
to have found her opponent.

63
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,000
He starts to release Arrow of Curse.

64
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,880
Hasn't Dancing rain found him yet?

65
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:40,920
Found him.

66
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,440
The fire is too strong.

67
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:44,840
Windward Formation can't keep casting magic
and begins to find shelters.

68
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:46,960
But Dancing rain's marksmanship was too precise.

69
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:50,000
Every bullet is restricting
the position of Windward Formation.

70
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,560
That's too violent.

71
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,040
Go wild.

72
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:14,200
Su Mu Cheng's attack rhythm for Launcher
is almost perfect.

73
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:18,560
Her skills convergence and output cycle
are the textbook of Launcher of Glory.

74
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,840
But Captain Wei's dodging is just so-so.

75
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:24,040
He has to find a interval between her attacks,
releases the skills,

76
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:26,720
but Su Mu Cheng did not give him
such an opportunity at all.

77
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,160
Sure enough, Dancing rain makes full use
of the advantages of high spot,

78
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,560
her attack was too wide-ranging.

79
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,400
Windward Formation is in danger.

80
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:39,960
Sister Su is so strong.

81
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:43,080
The series multi-skill of Mounted Gun,
few people in the league can do it.

82
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:45,920
Using the recoil of skills and common attack
to adjust her position and dodge the skills,

83
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,800
she's stronger than we can imagine.

84
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:55,280
It's rare for a female player
to play so powerfully and brilliantly.

85
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,400
They are fighting to the limit.

86
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,720
Sister Su, come on!

87
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:04,280
I'm sure Wei will win.

88
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:09,120
Dancing Rain is still accurately output
in the course of positioning.

89
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,920
Nice.

90
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:14,040
Her skills hit the target
after floating in the air.

91
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,480
Windward Formation's HP is empty.

92
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:18,040
The final of Arena Contest, Su Mu Cheng wins.

93
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,080
Congratulations on Su Mu Cheng.

94
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,720
Congratulations on Jia Shi.

95
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,160
So as the final of Arena Contest,

96
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:49,040
We can see
that Su Mu Cheng is as powerful as male player,

97
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:52,400
and we also saw
Wei Chen's persistence and elegance.

98
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:55,160
Thank you for bringing us such a wonderful game,

99
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:59,480
and letting us feel the glorious spirit
behind the game.

100
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:02,800
That little girl really grew up.

101
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,400
The young people are really something.

102
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,800
We old people have to catch up.

103
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,520
Su Mu Cheng won the game.

104
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:15,320
Congratulations on Su Mu Cheng.
Congratulations on Jia Shi.

105

For our Jia Shi,

125
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,920
for our

126
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,960
ten years.

127
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:02,760
We can't be teammates in tomorrow's game.

128
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:06,920
We can't play together as a team
in the later game, right?

129
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:11,680
Xing Xin and Jia Shi will eventually meet
in the Challenge.

130
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,160
Then,

131
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:18,220
welcome to becoming my rival.

132
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:25,600
I still want to be your fifth best partner
rather than an opponent.

133
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:30,480
But, how long will it take

134
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:34,000
to fight together again?

135
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,960
 ♫ We will go together and shake the world ♫ 

136
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:44,960
 ♫ We will go together to the legend ♫ 

137
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,040
I'm Su Mu Cheng.

138
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,880
Today, I officially returned to the team.

139
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:06,080
 ♫ I am an ordinary, but more than ordinary ♫

143
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,680
It seems that

144
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:21,080
I've really been away for a long time.

145
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:26,920
Leave it to me then.

146
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:34,880
 ♫ I have seen the legend before ♫ 

147
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,240
The Arena Contest is over.

148
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,840
The score of Jia Shi to Xing Xin is 10 to 8.

149
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:41,360
The total score is 34 to 29.

150
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:46,000
Jia Shi entered the Team Competition
with a five-point lead.

151
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:49,880
Captain Yu and Shao Tian, please have some rest.
Suit yourself.

152
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:51,520
Okay.

153
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,640
I don't know what your sponsor's thinking about,

154
00:10:57,640 --> 00:11:00,120
they ask Wang Jie Xi
to comment on the Team Competition.

155
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:02,440
That guy has two different eye pixels,

156
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:06,160
I really doubt
if he can see the broadcast screen clearly then.

157
00:11:08,833 --> 00:11:10,273
You're here.

158
00:11:11,924 --> 00:11:14,640
It's doesn't matter whether I can see it clearly,

159
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:20,320
but I saw clearly the game
that Wei Cao eliminated Lanyu.

160
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,320
Of course you can see that clearly,

161
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,200
because you are in good health,
you pay attention to the health care.

162
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,560
An old man like you drinks such bitter things.

163
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,200
We young people all drink sweets.

164
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,240
I'm really worried
about you suffer from the bitter

165
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:35,520
from the throat to the tips of your toes.

166
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:39,280
It's bitter in the mouth after drinking tea,

167
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:42,960
but it's bitter in your heart
after losing the game.

168
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:46,160
Do you think I made a good point, Anchor Pan?

169
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:50,000
I think... I have no idea.

170
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,120
I'm thirsty.

171
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:56,280
Well, wasn't Wei Cao also blocked
by Ambitions before the finals?

172
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,560
My coffee is as bitter as your tea.

173
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:07,320
If Wei Cao play with Ambitions one more time,
they may not win.

174
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:11,000
Captain Han.

175
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,560
Anything to drink?

176
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,880
Water.

177
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:17,320
Nothing else?

178
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:20,080
The water is so ordinary, nothing new.

179
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:22,000
It's normal for Ambitions to win,

180
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,120
there's no need for new ideas.

181
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,001
Captain Wang just said that

182
00:12:25,001 --> 00:12:28,960
Ambitions doesn't necessarily win Wei Cao,
what do you think, Anchor Pan?

183
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,280
What... what do I think...

184
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:35,040
I... I...

185
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:38,400
I've got a phone call. You guys go on.

186
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:46,840
Hello, Director Li,
when on earth will you come back?

187
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:50,040
The exciting Team Competition is about to begin.

188
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:52,040
If you think the Arena Contest is not enough,

189
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:54,640
you'll have the privilege
of witnessing a brilliant confrontation

190
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:58,080
between the two great tacticians,
Xiao Shi Qin and Ye Qiu.

191
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:01,080
Will the steady master of detail
dominate the situation,

192
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:04,600
or the genius Freelancer with frequent tricks
control the game?

193
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:07,799
Let's see it in the game.

194
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:14,400
There's five-point difference
between Xing Xin and Jia Shi,

195
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:16,160
It's not easy to comeback.

196
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:20,320
It is very likely that Jia Shi will continue
their victorious pursuit.

197
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:23,200
Every player is eager to win.

198
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:26,880
Especially those veterans
who have countless games left.

199
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:31,840
Go to the victory,
or go to the end.

200
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,280
Now both teams please take your place.

201
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,120
Lao Ye.

202
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:19,200
Lao Ye, come on! Lao Ye, come on!

203
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:23,080
Audience friends, the final of Challenge of Glory,

204
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:26,560
Team Competition between Xing Xin and Jia Shi
will begin soon.

205
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,960
All players have entered the battle room.

206
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:29,921
After the Arena Contest,

207
00:14:29,921 --> 00:14:32,480
Jia Shi is five points ahead of Xing Xin
in total points.

208
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,960
For Xing Xin, if they want
to win the championship,

209
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:36,160
this Team Competition...

210
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:39,120
Back to Alliance, enjoy the game.

211
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:43,600
Okay, all the characters enter the map.
The game officially starts.

212
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,840
Xing Xin's opening formation was well maintained
under Ye Qiu's command.

213
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:54,160
The purpose of the positioning is clear.

214
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,360
This is very important in Team Competition.

215
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:59,120
Right, we can see that
after Xiao Shi Qin's joining,

216
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:01,320
tactical discipline has also been improved.

217
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:03,840
Tactical positioning.

218
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,400
The formation of Jia Shi begins to change.

219
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,560
They don't want to get in touch
with Xing Xin too early.

220
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:09,320
- Although they are still far away...
- Plan B.

221
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:11,160
they are still cautious about their position.

222
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:15,880
Well, tactical positioning was adopted
on both teams at the beginning.

223
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:20,880
Every detail before the two teams meet each other
is crucial in such a game.

224
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,520
Jia Shi stops moving at this point.

225
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:29,440
We see that Xing Xin also stops moving.

226
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,960
Master Jie Xi, what do you think of this?

227
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:34,160
Xiao Shi Qin and Ye Qiu are
both experienced commanders.

228
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:34,880
They know very well that

229
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:37,480
taking the lead in discovering the opponent
will have some advantages.

230
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:40,200
Therefore, quiet approaching
and find the opportunity is preferred.

231
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,960
We are suddenly enlightened
after Master Jie Xi's explanation.

232
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:52,480
Jun Mo Xiao suddenly fired a shot.

233
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,080
This way.

234
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:55,720
Jia Shi will judge Xing Xing's position
according to the sound of shot.

235
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,600
Ye Qiu deliberately sent out signals
to the opponent.

236
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,640
- This is part of the tactics.
- Turn left.

237
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:03,200
Xing Xin immediately began to move quickly.

238
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:05,040
Another shot.

239
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,560
Jia Shi immediately stopped moving.

240
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:10,320
They haven't met yet,
but both the tacticians have begun to compete.

241
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,520
The third shot.

242
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:13,200
The three shots came
from three different directions.

243
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:13,960
It's a diversion.

244
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,960
They split up into two teams.
Jun Mo Xiao must go alone.

245
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:16,960
Let's hit it.

246
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:20,240
Sun Xiang and Qiu Fei plug in,
I bet you catch up with Jun Mo Xiao.

247
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,720
Copy that.

248
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:25,680
We see that Jia Shi has branched out
into two teams.

249
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:28,480
Combat Form is with Leaf of Autumn,
the other three are together.

250
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,680
Xiao Shi Qin found the target

251
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:33,240
- according to the time and location of the shot.
- Found him.

252
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:36,320
Leaf of Autumn found Jun Mo Xiao alone.

253
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:39,640
Assign two Battlemages to chase me,
what an amazing intuition.

254
00:16:40,379 --> 00:16:41,840
The diversion is working.

255
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:44,160
Now it's double pin down time.

256
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,600
I dragged their two main players.

257
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,760
Those three guys are up to you four.

258
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:50,200
Copy that.

259
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,160
The battlefield is now divided.

260
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:55,000
Jun Mo Xiao confront
with Leaf of Autumn and Combat Form alone,

261
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,400
Xing Xin's absolute core separated
from his teammates,

262
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,880
Jia Shi obviously won't let go
of this opportunity easily.

263
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:02,360
On the other side, Xing
Xin's playing four on three,

264
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:05,800
but it will not be difficult for Jia Shi
to have Xiao Shi Qin in the battle.

265
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:07,680
Now Leaf of Autumn catches up with Jun Mo Xiao.

266
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:09,720
Dragon Breaks the Ranks. Jun Mo Xiao is blown up.

267
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:12,480
Meanwhile, Combat Form has arrived.
Jun Mo Xiao is intercepted.

268
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:15,480
No way.

269
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:17,600
You've learned all I taught.

270
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:20,120
How dare you intercept me here?

271
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:23,920
I dare to do anything to win.

272
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,320
It's Shadow Tactic.

273
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,600
Combat Form becomes Leaf of Autumn's wingman.

274
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:40,440
Jun Mo Xiao was trapped
under the attack of those two.

275
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:43,040
Sun Xiang, don't you like solo?

276
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:45,760
This is Team Competition.

277
00:17:53,935 --> 00:17:58,480
I think in this era of stars,
very few teams will use this tactic.

278
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:03,760
Today Qiu Fei's performance makes us reconsider
what is the real Shadow Tactic.

279
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:08,480
Where's he?

280
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:11,720
Shadow Separation.

281
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:12,920
Jun Mo Xiao suddenly disappeared.

282
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:15,680
Leaf of Autumn and Combat Form start seeking.

283
00:18:18,374 --> 00:18:20,440
The launching scope of Shadow Separation
is fifteen position unit.

284
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:21,241
He won't go too far.

285
00:18:21,241 --> 00:18:22,600
Sun Xiang and Qiu Fei judged that

286
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,200
the location of Shadow Separation
won't be too far.

287
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,360
They continue to seek for him.

288
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:28,120
But we can see
that Master Ye Qiu is dodging skillfully,

289
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:29,760
he hasn't been found yet.

290
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:35,720
Jun Mo Xiao's HP has been consumed
by 70% at present.

291
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:37,760
The whole state is quite passive.

292
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:07,040
Dragon Soaring.

293
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:08,520
Too decisive.

294
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:11,440
Mechanical Rotor, dodging in the air,

295
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,800
and found Combat Form at his convenience.

296
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:14,280
Cloud Seize.

297
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:18,587
Your Shadow Tactic is not flawless at all.

298
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:22,240
This is an opportunity, Ye Qiu counterattacked.

299
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:26,800
You're the support,
why do you stand in the way of mine?

300
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,440
What are you dawdling behind?

301
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:30,040
Put up or shut up.

302
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:31,440
Fine.

303
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,960
Ye Qiu seized the opportunity to disrupt

304
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:35,160
the main attacker position
and the attack rhythm of support.

305
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,760
Sun Xiang was forced
to stand in the support Position.

306
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:39,640
Qiu Fei could not stop Ye Qiu's attack.

307
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:51,640
It's not so easy to break through.

308
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:54,800
Shadow Tactic has not just
one main attacker position.

309
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:56,800
Such a pity.

310
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:58,480
Your tactic didn't work.

311
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,880
Xiao Shi Qin told us that you make the diversion,

312
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,520
we'll beat you at your own game.

313
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:06,680
Everyone else in Xing Xin is a piece of loose sand
as long as we hold you back.

314
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:12,400
Yi Fan. They are in danger.

315
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,280
Be careful of the traps.

316
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,480
Let's turn our attention
to the other part of the battlefield.

317
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:16,960
It's bounding mine.

318
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:19,480
Most players of Xing Xin
has been ambushed by Jia Shi.

319
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:23,880
It's the bounding mine arranged by Sheng Ling Mie.

320
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:24,760
They are nearby.

321
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:26,080
Be aware.

322
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:29,560
Xing Xin doesn't lack of harm face to face.

323
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:32,640
Their best choice is
to focus on fighting the Cleric Woven Shadow.

324
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:36,320
Meanwhile they must pay attention,
not to rush forward, or they'll be sneak attacked.

325
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:44,320
Found Woven Shadow.

326
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:45,720
Catch him up.

327
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:52,000
Han Yan Rou's Dragon Breaks the Ranks
is intercepted by Successive Strike.

328
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,600
Woven Shadow counterattacks.

329
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:58,480
Han Yan Rou, Yi Cun Hui, Bao Zi, the Invader
are all consumed.

330
00:20:58,480 --> 00:20:59,520
Xiao Shi Qin had long anticipated

331
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:00,760
that Xing Xin will try her best
to kill the Cleric.

332
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:01,640
Nice.

333
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:03,560
And laid out a counter-attack strategy
in advance.

334
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:05,320
Jia Shi is constantly accumulating advantages.

335
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:05,921
Right. Let's see.

336
00:21:05,921 --> 00:21:08,680
After this fight, Xing Xin team lost a lot of HP.

337
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:10,040
Only 70% left.

338
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:12,360
Xing Xin is at a disadvantage
in both battlefields.

339
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:14,200
Someone needs to help Jun Mo Xiao out of trouble.

340
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:14,920
Yes.

341
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:18,520
We can see that Jun Mo Xiao is still entangled
by the two Battlemages of Jia Shi.

342
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:23,960
When you get back to your teammates,
they're all dead.

343
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:26,480
That's not right. You won't go back.

344
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:31,960
Critical moment.
He hit Leaf of Autumn and Combat Form.

345
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:34,720
They all fell to the ground straight and stiff.

346
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,880
I'm afraid you'll be disappointed.

347
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:43,520
Thanks, Wu Chen.

348
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:46,000
Xing Xin indeed holds back a trick.

349
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,880
It took some time to climb up.

350
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,320
Nice timing.

351
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:55,280
Next, it's your turn, Lian Jin.

352
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,880
Copy that.

353
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,080
Launcher who occupies high spot
without any interference,

354
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:02,160
it's horrible.

355
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,280
Dawn Rifle continuously releases the skills.

356
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,880
The dodging of Sheng Ling Mie
and Woven Shadow is restricted.

357
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:07,040
They are very passive.

358
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,760
The Counterattack Begins.

359
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:24,880
He killed Successive Strike
with a series of skills.

360
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,480
Jia Shi lost one person.

361
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:29,400
This is Ye Qiu's Screen Gun Tactic
founded in Jia Shi.

362
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:32,560
Today Xing Xin suppressed Jia Shi
with this classical tactic.

363
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:35,320
This is undoubtedly another psychological strike
to Jia Shi.

364
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:38,520
Now it seems
that Xing Xin is more like a former Jia Shi.

365
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:39,121
Exactly.

366
00:22:39,121 --> 00:22:41,400
Now the momentum of Xing Xin
has undoubtedly reached to the top.

367
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:43,480
Long live Xing Xin!

368
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:45,360
Long live Xing Xin!

369
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:48,760
We can't lose to them. Jia Shi will win!

370
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:52,920
Long live Xing Xin!

371
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:56,080
Jia Shi! Jia Shi!

372
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:00,320
Jia Xing, pay attention to our HP.
Sharpshooter, prepare for support.

373
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:01,160
Copy that.

374
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:02,600
On my way.

375
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:05,320
We can see
that Jia Shi's substitute Matchstick is in.

376
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:06,321
Bao Zi, Tang Rou.

377
00:23:06,321 --> 00:23:07,560
The coordination is 373, 480.

378
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:09,160
Climb over directly, kill the Cleric.

379
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:09,960
Understood.

380
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:12,560
Jia Shi's substitute is in,
and will arrive in half a minute.

381
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:15,480
Senior Wu Chen, captain will arrive
in one and a half minutes.

382
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:17,560
Understood. One and a half minutes.

383
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:19,520
I'll stall their Sharpshooter.

384
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:33,760
Well, in order to intercept Matchstick,

385
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:36,280
Dawn Rifle gives up the advantage of long-range

386
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:37,720
and fight close with Matchstick.

387
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:40,160
Matchstick makes full use
of sharpshooter's flexible advantage,

388
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:42,240
keep dodging and finding shelters.

389
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:44,520
This is what Xing Xin would like to see very much.

390
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:46,600
If Matchstick doesn't return quickly,

391
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:50,000
Xing Xin will fight one man more
and kill Jia Shi's Cleric.

392
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,440
What are you doing? Come over quickly.

393
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:01,800
On the way.

394
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:04,960
The Launcher of Xing Xin keeps following me.

395
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:08,160
It's obvious that Matchstick is suffering
from Dawn Rifle's stalling.

396
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:09,640
His teammates are also under a lot of pressure.

397
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:12,680
It has to be said
that his performance so far has been crucial.

398
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:15,640
He is the greatest contributor
to Xing Xin's advantage.

399
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:16,520
Exactly.

400
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:19,200
The Launcher operated by Wu Chen
is too aggressive,

401
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,280
he dares to stick close to the Sharpshooter.

402
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:23,480
We know Launchers would suffer a lot
in close combat.

403
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:26,560
This is the tactic. he chose
to entangle his opponent.

404
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:34,480
My God. Launcher fight me close.

405
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,320
Is he crazy?

406
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:40,280
It's not like a duel between two Launchers at all.

407
00:24:44,199 --> 00:24:48,919
He's trading his own HP consumption for time
to hold his opponent back.

408
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:12,880
Is this man crazy?

409
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,680
Matchstick seizes the opportunity, headshot.

410
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:19,400
Dawn Rifle is in danger.

411
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:23,600
Bao Zi, hold on. Healing the low HP.

412
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:26,120
Don't worry about me. You cover Tang.

413
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:27,360
Ten more seconds.

414
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,800
Be there in nine seconds. Hang in there.

415
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:53,920
Dawn Rifle and Matchstick have turned white-hot
on the other side of the battlefield.

416
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,760
They both aim each other.

417
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:02,880
Nice.

418
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,920
Dawn Rifle is killed first.

419
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:07,080
Wait.

420
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:08,920
Dawn Rifle launched his skill at the last minute,

421
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:12,680
there's no time for Matchstick to dodge,
he's killed too.

422
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:16,440
Master Jie Xi, can you give us an analysis
of the current situation on the battlefield?

423
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:17,640
These techniques are critical.

424
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:20,760
Dawn Rifle successfully killed Matchstick,
mission is beautifully accomplished.

425
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:22,560
Now Jia Shi's substitute has been killed,

426
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:25,960
Xing Xin's substitute Cleric, Cold Hands,
will soon join the battlefield.

427
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:29,280
Then, I'll leave it to you guys.

428
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:31,760
Wu Chen, great game.

429
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:42,200
He killed Woven Shadow with a close hit.

430
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,440
Long live Xing Xin.

431
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:46,080
Ye Qiu is the master.

432
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:47,400
Xing Xin goes a step further.

433
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:50,320
They've killed three people,
the situation is very good.

434
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:53,760
Then, leave it to us.

435
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:59,320
So far Xing Xin still has five people left
in the battlefield.

436
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:01,280
Jia Shi only has three left.

437
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:04,360
Xing Xin's Launcher gave
up the long-range advantage,

438
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:07,240
took away Jia Shi's Sharpshooter with himself,

439
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:08,560
won over lots of time for the team.

440
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:12,720
It can be said
that he is the match point in this game.

441
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,560
Moreover, Jun Mo Xiao arrived in time,

442
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:16,880
helped the team kill Jia Shi's Cleric.

443
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:19,240
Now Jia Shi lost three in row,

444
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:21,280
the situation is far from good.

445
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:24,280
But why did Captain Xiao send
the two main players out?

446
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:26,400
If it weren't two main players,

447
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:28,520
Jia Shi can't hold Ye Qiu back.

448
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:29,361
But Captain Xiao thought

449
00:27:29,361 --> 00:27:31,120
the winning point was Ye Qiu.

450
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:34,320
He didn't expect
the other players in Xing Xin to grow up so fast.

451
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:35,840
Even the newcomer Qiao Yi Fan

452
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:38,280
can take the lead.

453
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:49,640
Xiao Shi Qin, you are poor of HP,

454
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:51,800
I say you just surrender.

455
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,560
If that makes Captain Ye happy.

456
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:11,880
Sheng Ling Mie stops suddenly.

457
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:13,760
Does the tactician still have any trick?

458
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:15,120
The situation is too tense.

459
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:17,880
Any operational details can make
a world-shaking change in the situation.

460
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:19,560
Sheng Ling Mie is self-destructing.

461
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:21,040
Stand back.

462
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:35,720
An instantaneous explosion.

463
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:36,920
It's a self-destruction.

464
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:39,720
Xiao Shi Qin let the situation reverse directly.

465
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:40,721
It's amazing.

466
00:28:40,721 --> 00:28:43,080
The points before with
the points of Arena Contest,

467
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:46,360
Xing Xin has to remain three players to win.

468
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:47,640
Han Yan Rou, Yi Cun Hui,

469
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:49,560
Bao Zi, the Invader are all low HP,

470
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:50,521
if Sheng Ling Mie's self-destruction

471
00:28:50,521 --> 00:28:52,600
can kill all three,

472
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:55,360
Jia Shi will win the game in advance.

473
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:07,121
Let's see

474
00:29:07,121 --> 00:29:08,680
the effect of this self-destruction.

475
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:10,120
Yi Cun Hui's out.

476
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:11,920
Bao Zi, the Invader is out.

477
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:13,800
Han Yan Rou's HP is only 5% left.

478
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:15,680
How did she survive?

479
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:33,480
Come on!

480
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:39,120
Come on! Come on! Come on!

481
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:41,000
Han Yan Rou's HP is nearly empty,

482
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,720
we can win in advance if we hit her.

483
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:45,120
Combat Form and Leaf of Autumn
are chasing after Han Yan Rou,

484
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,600
Leaf of Autumn intercepts.

485
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:49,240
A Freelancer and a Battlemage
versus two other battlemages.

486
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:50,720
Jia Shi concentrates attack on Han Yan Rou,

487
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,000
whose HP is only 5% left.

488
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,640
Xing Xin conducts a desperate struggle.

489
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:54,241
Tang Rou.

490
00:29:54,241 --> 00:29:55,520
Two minutes and fifty-eight seconds left.

491
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:56,480
They have to be aced.

492
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:58,360
We have to remain three people.

493
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:00,880
Tang, hang in there.

494
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,360
Understood.

495
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:07,560
Nice.

496
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:26,400
Furious Dragon Strikes the
Heart. He hit Han Yan Rou.

497
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,840
Jun Mo Xiao's healing

498
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,440
is almost at the same time.

499
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:31,520
Han Yan Rou's little HP goes up again.

500
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:34,040
It remains at 1%.

501
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,240
Magic Shield.

502
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:37,360
Han Yan Rou didn't give up the chance to attack

503
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:40,120
while she's HP is almost empty.

504
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:45,720
Keep consuming.

505
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:52,840
Let's kill her now.

506
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:54,440
As Jun Mo Xiao battles his opponent,

507
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:55,680
he needs to find a chance

508
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:56,720
to heal Han Yan Rou.

509
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:58,960
Only Ye Qiu can do this.

510
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:00,520
But now Jun Mo Xiao's healing skills

511
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:01,680
are all cooling down.

512
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:04,400
He won't save Han Yan Rou this time.

513
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:08,120
Now no one can save you.

514
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:09,280
Leaf of Autumn hits back Han Yan Rou.

515
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:10,120
Danger.

516
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:12,000
She still has 1% HP left.

517
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,880
How could this happen?

518
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:14,960
It's Cold Hands.

519
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,640
Xing Xin's substitute Cleric arrived

520
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:18,360
at time at the critical moment.

521
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:22,040
Everyone,

522
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:23,320
sorry for the waiting.

523
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:37,560
How about it?

524
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:38,840
Even if I'm worse,

525
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:41,160
I'm Xing Xin's Cleric.

526
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:07,400
 ♫ The starry fireflies from the ordinary ♫ 

527
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:11,320
 ♫ Sailing with the wind and
converge into the Milky Way ♫ 

528
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:15,200
 ♫ Standing on the top and claiming that ♫ 

529
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:20,320
 ♫ We will regain our glory ♫ 

530
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:24,560
 ♫ Push the clouds aside and shine the light ♫ 

531
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:26,040
The Team Competition is drawing to an end.

532
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:27,520
The last sixty seconds.

533
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:28,554
Will Xing Xin tries their best

534
00:32:28,554 --> 00:32:29,720
to turn back the situation and win,

535
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:32,480
or Jia Shi makes a breakthrough
and defend the Glory?

536
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:36,720
 ♫ The past overlaps the present ♫ 

537
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:40,160
 ♫ The glory we've missed ♫ 

538
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:43,960
 ♫ The pride in the future ♫ 

539
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:48,200
 ♫ Intertwined between the fingers ♫ 

540
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:51,760
 ♫ Composing the great song of battlefield ♫ 

541
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:55,400
 ♫ The only light during the long night ♫ 

542
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:58,920
 ♫ Is us from the ordinary life ♫ 

543
00:32:58,920 --> 00:32:59,840
Kill Combat Form.

544
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:03,120
 ♫ Above the cloud, in the dust ♫ 

545
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:07,120
 ♫ We are the brightest fireflies ♫ 

546
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:12,120
 ♫ I came from the past and will write the future ♫ 

547
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:13,521
Go for it.

548
00:33:13,521 --> 00:33:15,080
Go for it, Tang.

549
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:18,520
Long live Xing Xin!

550
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:19,200
Hold out!

551
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:19,760
All of you, hold out!

552
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:20,520
Leave them to me.

553
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:21,520
Don't hold back.

554
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:22,480
Go straight up.

555
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:24,320
Do you know what you're talking about?

556
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:26,000
Our goal is to win the championship.

557
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,200
It's not the win or lose of the game.

558
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:28,840
Do you know that?

559
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,800
Tang, run.

560
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:37,800
Now Han Yan Rou's HP is only 10%.

561
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:41,000
Cold Hands' HP is only 30%.

562
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:54,521
Hit them.

563
00:33:54,521 --> 00:33:57,040
But Combat Form's last skill,
Destroying the World,

564
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:58,920
consumes too much.

565
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:05,080
Jun Mo Xiao wants to support, but it's too late.

566
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:06,560
Han Yan Rou, Cold Hands and Combat Form's

567
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:08,600
HP are all empty.

568
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:12,200
 ♫ We are the brightest fireflies ♫ 

569
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:13,960
So now the two teams are tied
in the Team Competition.

570
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:17,200
But the totol points of Xing Xin is still
five points behind Jia Shi.

571
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:20,000
Even if Jia Shi is aced by Xing Xin
and gains points,

572
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,200
Xing Xin will still lose by one point.

573
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:26,000
In other words,
Jia Shi has already locked in the championship.
