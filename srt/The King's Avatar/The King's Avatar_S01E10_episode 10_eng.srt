 "Light From the Ashes" - Cai Weize

00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:06,340
♫  Countless fireflies born from insignificance  ♫

♫  Melting ice and snow, overcoming twists and turns  ♫

8
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:31,230
♫  Finally at this moment of peak  ♫

9
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:35,300
♫  There is a figure that coincides with the past  ♫

10
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:39,080
♫  The glory of the past that never came  ♫

11
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:42,810
♫  The pride that the future will never pass  ♫

12
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:46,540
♫  Our fingertips intertwined and condensed  ♫

13
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:50,490
♫  Into a song that ignited the battlefield  ♫

♫  The only light in an endless night  ♫

15
00:00:54,230 --> 00:00:58,010
♫  Is you and me who overcame mediocrity  ♫

♫  I came from the legend to carry on a legend  ♫

19

♫  Up on the clouds and down in the dust  ♫

♫  Fireflies making every effort to illuminate  ♫

22
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:24,910
♫  Fireflies making every effort to illuminate  ♫

23
00:01:24,910 --> 00:01:27,960
   

24
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:30,440
   

25
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:39,200
Excellent Dynasty team members, get ready to encircle Lord Grim.

26
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,760
Don't let any of them go. Kill them all.

27
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:43,340
Go!

28
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:51,940
Oh my! So many enemies!

29
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:54,160
Old Ye, did you stir up a hornet's nest?

30
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:04,280
Old Ye, you're heartless, running off without me?

31
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:06,680
Hey, wait for me! Wait!

32
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:26,150
 Subtitles and Timing provided to you by💥🍥 TEAM 7️⃣ 🍥💥 @viki.com 

33
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:34,740
Now nobody is here. Come clean, Old Ye.

34
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:36,680
What unethical thing have you done?

35
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:40,080
 Steal their inventory or steal someone's girlfriend? Let me guess. 

36
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,941
I bet Cleansing Mist is upset about you retiring from Glory.

37
00:02:41,941 --> 00:02:44,380
So she decided to follow you until you came back.

38
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:46,800
 No? Then don't tell me. Let me guess again. 

39
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,100
Oh... I see.

40
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:50,800
It must be like this! Your plot was revealed.

41
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,361
 That's why everyone is chasing you. Am I right? 

42
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,700
Shh.

43
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,300
Under the tree, follow me.

44
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,240
Captain, nothing.

45
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:39,580
Captain, nothing here, either.

46
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,140
Let's check over there. Team one, go left. Team two, go right.

47
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:49,840
 Copy that. 

48
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:57,700
That's rare. The kid has grown up.

49
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:59,320
You've learned to restrain.

50
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:01,120
Lord Grim is despicable and shameless.

51
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,221
You promised to PK with me, but you tricked me into a fight.

52
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,800
   

53
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:15,200
Text bubbles. He's over here!

54
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:20,420
   

55
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:32,580
Follow me! Follow me closely.

56
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:36,460
Can you screw over your teammates in a more direct way?

57
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:38,340
Hey, you can't blame that on me.

58
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:40,500
You wouldn't let me talk, so I could only send text bubbles.

59
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,000
I have cooperated with you well enough.

60
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,860
Don't you know who their target is?

61
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:46,060
Do you think I'm a bad teammate? You're the troublemaker.

62
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:50,020
Fine, I'll just stay away from you. I'm going to dump you.

63
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:51,010
They want to run away.

64
00:04:51,010 --> 00:04:53,540
Split and outflank them. Split and outflank them.

65
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,900
Who are you?

66
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:18,060
How did you find this place?

67
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,880
   

68
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:24,180
"Concealed Light"?

69
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:26,500
Where did I see this IGN before?

70
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,400
Concealed Light?

71
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,760
Why are you here?

72
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:32,200
Don't bother me.

73
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:35,900
This is the perfect blind spot I found after many times of data analysis.

74
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:39,500
In theory, it should not be discovered by anyone else.

75
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,200
By the way, let me ask you something.

76
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:44,700
How do I get to the leveling area that's in the middle Congee Forest?

77
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:47,600
First, tell me how you found this place.

78
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:51,600
I'll tell you, but don't get scared.

79
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:57,620
I'm currently avoiding a mysterious hunt.

80
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:03,740
A psycho.

81
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:05,700
Steamed Bun...

82
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:09,680
Are you Steamed Bun Invasion that's on Lord Grim's team?

83
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:12,200
Bingo.

84
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,180
Why?

85
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:16,380
Am I that famous in the 10th Server now?

86
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:18,160
It's really you.

87
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,900
Are you my fan?

88
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:21,400
Come, I'll let you have a look.

89
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,900
Come, have a look at my equipment.

90
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:26,800
Are they awesome? Are they cool?

91
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:31,020
What do you think? The claws aren't bad, right?

92
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:32,580
Orange weapon Bloodsucking Claw.

93
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:34,380
Equipment.

94
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:40,120
Purple equipment? Why is it purple equipment?

95
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:45,500
Physical attack is only 300. 300?

96
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,880
Three hundred is too low.

97
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:54,700
Are you not wearing your full set of orange equipment today?

98
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:56,500
Why do I need a full set of orange equipment?

99
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:59,580
Boss and I rely on our skills to defeat enemies barehanded.

100
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:01,040
We don't need any equipment.

101
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,940
Your boss?

102
00:07:06,161 --> 00:07:07,020
Lord Grim.

103
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:08,740
- Is your boss Lord Grim? 
 - Enough, leave me alone.

104
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:12,380
- I'm going to find my boss now. Bye. 
 - Lord Grim.

105
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:14,500
Wait for me.

106
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:18,840
- Can you do it? 
 - One more time.

107
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:26,300
Such a rookie. Here, I'll give you a hand.

108
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:27,840
Come on.

109
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:40,080
Thanks a lot.

110
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:43,380
Steamed Bun Invasion came out. He's beside the dry well.

111
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:47,740
Guys, why won't you leave me alone?

112
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:52,700
Litttle Brother, ready?

113
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:54,800
Run!

114
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:02,500
Hey! Are they nuts? Why are they chasing me?

115
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,740
Fine. Chase me if you like.

116
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:06,260
Want to chase me? Maybe in your next life!

117
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:08,100
Kids, you didn't even know where the power button was

118
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:09,520
when Daddy started to play Glory.

119
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,260
Didn't you check the almanac before hunting?

120
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:13,800
Wait. Flowing Tree is only level 27.

121
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,520
No need to chase after a useless Blade Master.

122
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,460
It's a waste of time, ignore that trash.

123
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:19,940
- Go after Lord Grim. Let's go. 
 - What? "Trash"?

124
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:21,400
Stop!

125
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:24,500
Who just said I was trash? Step forward.

126
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:27,360
I'll teach you how to spell "trash"!

127
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:36,620
One, two, three, four.

128
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:39,240
Four pieces of trash. You're lined up pretty well.

129
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,861
Why? Lining up for recycling?

130
00:08:40,861 --> 00:08:43,200
I'm sorry, I forgot. You are all non-recyclables!

131
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,140
If you're a bit aware of that, dig a hole to bury yourself,

132
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:48,100
and stop polluting the environment!

133
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:54,640
You said those words just now, right?

134
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,160
Yeah, that was me.

135
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,640
Good. It seems like you're itching for a beating.

136
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:02,300
Are you perhaps the legendary... "Cheap" Master?

137
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:05,660
Cheap Master, Cheap Master, Cheap Master.

138
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:10,700
Cheap Master, Cheap Master, Cheap Master.

139
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:14,440
Take that, take that, take that!

140
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:17,160
Take that, that, that!

141
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:28,000
What happened?

142
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:34,800
Hey, Cheap buddy.

143
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,320
Let's have a good chat. Hey! Stop!

144
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:39,100
That's enough.

145
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:40,700
- Cheap Master. 
 - Hey!

146
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:43,140
Why are you repeating my words? Let me tell you.

147
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:46,021
Explain yourself, did you mean "blade" or "cheap"?

148
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:49,400
   

149
00:09:49,401 --> 00:09:51,520
- Let's meet here. 
 - Wait, I'm missing a sword.

150
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:53,840
Let me get a sword first.

151
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:56,400
A Cheap Master getting a sword, the cheapness is endless.

152
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,520
Hi, little Cheap Master up ahead. Don't run away.

153
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:00,560
Do you want to exchange equipment? Don't run away.

154
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,801
I'll still catch up to you even if you toss all your equipment and run naked.

155
00:10:02,801 --> 00:10:04,800
Why is this man so rude?

156
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:10,120
But, if you lend me your sword, I can reluctantly forgive you for a bit.

157
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:12,900
How would you like to borrow it?

158
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:18,320
Guess.

159
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:26,900
Like that.

160
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:28,880
   

161
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:31,360
Oh, I'm so lucky.

162
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,280
I can get an orange weapon by beating a random person.

163
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:38,640
It's been ages since I last logged on, so it feels different. I'm so lucky.

164
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,101
Hey, buddy.

165
00:10:40,101 --> 00:10:42,520
Don't worry too much, I'm just borrowing it.

166
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:45,840
I'll give it back to you soon. Bye-bye.

167
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:51,420
- So happy. 
 - They're here. Stay hidden.

168
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:14,680
She came out.

169
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:16,941
- She came out. Attack. 
 - Okay. Go.

170
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:09,880
Cleansing Mist disappeared.

171
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:12,000
Everyone, increase your cannon attacks.

172
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,900
Pursue individually.

173
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:18,280
Everyone, keep a close watch.

174
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:20,120
Get the Gatling Guns ready.

175
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,700
Attack with everything as soon as they appear.

176
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:23,600
 - Copy. 
 - Copy. 

177
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,460
Yifan, Flame Boundary with heavy artillery.

178
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:30,360
Okay.

179
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:36,420
Three, two, one.

180
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:45,020
Fire. Attack with everything you've got!

181
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,780
Senior, sorry.

182
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:52,700
I was slow just now.

183
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:54,960
It's all right.

184
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:57,740
Let's see how long they can hold out.

185
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,641
Cleansing Mist and One Inch Ash have no way out now.

186
00:13:06,641 --> 00:13:08,740
Steamed Bun Invasion is under control.

187
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:10,580
There's even a passer-by.

188
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:13,520
Soft Mist was also ganked in Congee City.

189
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:15,020
She's going to die soon.

190
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:16,920
Lord Grim is nothing special.

191
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:19,460
He's already a salted fish on the chopping board.

192
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:23,700
Comrades, time to finish up.

193
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:26,140
 - Copy. 
 - Copy. 

194
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:28,200
How are you doing, Yifan?

195
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:30,000
How about you, Xiao Tang?

196
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:32,560
Bun?

197
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:36,310
   

198
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,760
Old Ye, I got it, I got it!

199
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:00,560
What do you think of it? An orange weapon.

200
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,420
Look at my luck. Aren't I impressive?

201
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:04,960
Yes, go ahead, my hero.

202
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,340
What are you talking about?

203
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:07,860
Don't you want to PK?

204
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:11,440
Typical wilderness PK. Whoever kills the most, wins.

205
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,440
You tricked me again, didn't you?

206
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,840
Fine, I'll fight.

207
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,820
I'm not afraid. Bring it on.

208
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:55,721
Today, this daddy will show you what "Three Flowing Swords" is.

209
00:14:55,721 --> 00:14:57,100
One sword to kill three people.

210
00:14:57,100 --> 00:15:00,520
One, two... The legendary "Three Flowing Swords."

211
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:03,700
Slash, slash, slash.

212
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:04,940
Why am I feeling a bit breathless?

213
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:06,680
Talking too much to the point of being breathless.

214
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:08,800
You're so talented.

215
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:16,260
Don't laugh at me. I'm just out of HP.

216
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:18,781
Don't be so smug. I'm guessing you're low on MP, too.

217
00:15:18,781 --> 00:15:20,800
Are there any rookies left to bully now?

218
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:23,330
Wait until I recover my MP. I'll fight you to the end.

219
00:15:23,330 --> 00:15:24,560
   

220
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,100
Let's go and replenish it.

221
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:28,960
There are children waiting for us to save.

222
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:31,020
You want to trick me again, don't you?

223
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:33,520
Well, for the sake of the children,

224
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:34,820
I'll reluctantly go with you.

225
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:36,720
Let's go.

226
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,500
Not bad.

227
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,560
No doubt you're an expert.

228
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,500
You were able to hold out until now.

229
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:15,780
It's a pity that you are still so full of yourself.

230
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:19,581
Do you know how many people hate you to the core?

231
00:16:19,581 --> 00:16:22,600
Now you've offended everyone.

232
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:26,160
You aren't aware that a great calamity is at hand.

233
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:30,300
Seems like this "Cheap" Swordsman knows you.

234
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:34,960
Little fella, if you lose to me today,

235
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:37,740
you can only blame yourself for befriending the wrong person.

236
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:39,760
 You've all fallen into the trap. 

237
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:44,380
Ye Qiu, do you know why I keep letting you escape?

238
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:47,560
I wanted to deplete your HP.

239
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:51,060
Aren't you very good at fighting? Bring it on then.

240
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:52,940
 Now, you have no MP at all, 

241
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:55,080
and can't even use any skills.

242
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:57,540
How are you any different from a level zero player?

243
00:17:00,650 --> 00:17:02,810
   

244
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:08,160
Fine, I'll fight you first,

245
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,900
then these unimportant followers.

246
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:12,180
Sure.

247
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:14,360
Go ahead and try.

248
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:15,580
No, no, no.

249
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:17,420
I haven't won you in a PK yet.

250
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:18,700
This kind of garbage is not worth fighting,

251
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:21,420
and you can't just let someone steal your umbrella.

252
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:24,180
Do you want me to kill him for you?

253
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:07,320
Boss, we are here.

254
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:09,600
Senior, are you all right?

255
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:13,180
What do you think? Was my aim accurate?

256
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:15,720
What are you doing, Buddy?

257
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:18,541
Why are you just standing there? Quickly replenish Boss's MP.

258
00:18:18,541 --> 00:18:21,080
Bun, how did you come here?

259
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:24,100
Not in a normal way.

260
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:43,100
What do you think, Boss? Aren't I good?

261
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:45,020
Hurry and praise me.

262
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:46,920
Very clever.

263
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,540
How about you guys? You forcefully broke through?

264
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:52,160
No, it was a pleasant cooperation.

265
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:55,860
Senior, I want to try again.

266
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,920
Very good.

267
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:13,440
Didn't I tell you to wait in the city?

268
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,460
For me,

269
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:18,420
there's no such thing as "wait," only "fight."

270
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:27,780
Your 180-degree sweep worked very well.

271
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:34,120
Grandmaster, 20 units at your two o'clock direction,

272
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:36,420
there's a blind spot to go offline.

273
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:39,540
All right. Everyone, retreat.

274
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:47,160
They're trying to escape.

275
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:48,340
Set up a defense at the two o'clock direction.

276
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:50,980
Guild master, two o'clock is our blind spot.

277
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:53,040
Jerk.

278
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,900
Xiao Tang, don't fight.

279
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:08,440
My spear...

280
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:11,120
I will personally get it back myself.

281
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:15,580
♫  Countless fireflies born from insignificance  ♫

282
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:19,000
Do you all want to help Xiao Tang take back her spear?

283
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,463
Of course.

284
00:20:20,463 --> 00:20:21,533
Bring it on.

285
00:20:21,533 --> 00:20:22,500
Let's go.

286
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:24,061
All right.

287
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:32,680
♫  Clear the clouds and descend with the heat  ♫

309
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:45,777
You guys did a great job.

310
00:22:45,777 --> 00:22:47,480
This is the end of our adventure.

311
00:22:51,629 --> 00:22:53,329
I'm exhausted.

312
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:55,301
There's such a huge gap in skills.

313
00:22:55,301 --> 00:22:57,100
Who the heck is Lord Grim?

314
00:22:58,140 --> 00:22:59,976
- Our strategy was wrong. 
 - That's right.

315
00:22:59,976 --> 00:23:02,600
We were completely defeated. 
    

316
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:06,840
Chen Yehui, was that your brilliant plan?

317
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:10,340
You gathered people from all over the place,

318
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:13,780
and brothers from seven guilds were all under your control.

319
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:16,280
Before, you swore that nothing would go wrong.

320
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:17,839
But what now?

321
00:23:17,839 --> 00:23:20,480
How do you explain it?

322
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:23,720
Chen Yehui, how will you take responsibility

323
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:25,520
for the sacrifice of our brothers?

324
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:30,240
Guild Masters, please calm down.

325
00:23:31,189 --> 00:23:33,220
It was a mistake, really.

326
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:34,580
I admit it.

327
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:37,360
My plan tonight was not thorough enough.

328
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:41,520
But I never expected there would suddenly be a Flowing Tree and Concealed Light.

329
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:44,841
Otherwise, he would never be able to break through the first layer of encirclement.

330
00:23:44,841 --> 00:23:46,300
Even if he broke through,

331
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:48,500
he wouldn't have had the chance to heal himself.

332
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:50,060
Bullsh*t, "not thorough enough"?

333
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:51,540
It seems to me that you have thought about everything.

334
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:52,701
Our Tyrannical Ambition was wiped out.

335
00:23:52,701 --> 00:23:55,860
But you? You barely lost anything. What's the meaning of that?

336
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:57,700
Chen Yehui,

337
00:23:57,700 --> 00:24:00,060
you made the rest of us as vanguard units.

338
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:02,780
But Excellent Dynasty only came to gank at the very end.

339
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:06,960
Were you just... using us?

340
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,700
You're right.

341
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:10,400
I feel the same.

342
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:13,680
You must explain everything to us.

343
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:16,541
The six big guilds are all here.

344
00:24:16,541 --> 00:24:19,940
Don't think that just by paying for our hotel and flights,

345
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:23,120
we won't hold you accountable.

346
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:28,660
Right. Also, I already boasted to Captain Jiexi that we would win.

347
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:31,420
I have to report to him what happened in the 10th Server tomorrow.

348
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:33,540
But today, all of our guild elites

349
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:36,440
got demoted levels because of today's ganking.

350
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:39,700
How should I explain it to Captain Jiexi?

351
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:44,340
Guys, it was truly a misunderstanding.

352
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:46,660
How could I have any selfish scheme?

353
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:49,840
Don't you see that Excellent Dynasty also suffered a great loss?

354
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:52,140
Forget it.

355
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:54,920
I knew Chen was not reliable.

356
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:56,620
Let's go.

357
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:01,540
We have a common goal

358
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:03,760
and that is to defeat Lord Grim and his team.

359
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:04,681
As long as the League exists—

360
00:25:04,681 --> 00:25:05,860
What bullsh*t!

361
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:07,580
We are the league,

362
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:10,840
while you're just bullsh*t.

363
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:15,900
Ye Qiu.

364
00:25:58,246 --> 00:26:00,460
 What have you done after you joined the guild? 

365
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:02,188
 How many dungeon records did you set? 

366
00:26:02,188 --> 00:26:04,100
 What's the increase in membership? 

367
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:05,720
 If you're not good at management, 

368
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:09,800
 it would be useless even if the whole team is there for you. 

369
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:11,960
 What's going on with you? 

370
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:14,700
 You even asked the pro teams to help you do dungeon quests? 

371
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:17,620
 Can you accept the consequences of losing the tournament? 

372
00:26:18,122 --> 00:26:21,560
 President Tao, I admit that 

373
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:24,040
 I, Chen Yehui, am selfish at times. 

374
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:28,321
 But I swear, I never thought of harming Excellent Era. 

375
00:26:28,321 --> 00:26:30,920
 It seems that you are really going down. 

376
00:26:32,418 --> 00:26:34,699
 Only those in higher places can go down. 

377
00:26:34,699 --> 00:26:38,040
 If someone is always at the bottom, he is nothing but desperate. 

378
00:26:45,683 --> 00:26:51,641
   

379
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:03,480
 Admin. 

380
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:05,661
 I'm the guest from VIP Room 214. 

381
00:27:05,661 --> 00:27:07,340
 I want a pen and some paper. 

382
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:08,540
 Don't mess up this time. 

383
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:10,620
 The pen must be a 0.45 millimeter. 

384
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:13,160
 The weight of the paper must be 4.39 grams. 

385
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:17,840
Got it. Please hold on.

386
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:22,812
Is this guy a paper shredder?

387
00:27:22,812 --> 00:27:24,712
Why does he need so much paper?

388
00:27:34,512 --> 00:27:35,340
Here's your pen and paper.

389
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:37,140
 Come in, the door's unlocked. 

390
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:40,580
I'll leave the things here.

391
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:41,520
It's the last one.

392
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:44,400
If you want more, I'll have to go to the store.

393
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,940
We don't stock these here.

394
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:49,836
Lord Grim must have lied to me. He must have.

395
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:53,700
17'20"17 matches perfectly.

396
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:55,900
My calculations can't be wrong.

397
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:57,540
Liar!

398
00:28:07,079 --> 00:28:10,060
   

399
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,160
Are you Concealed Light?

400
00:28:15,796 --> 00:28:17,496
You know me?

401
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:20,060
I've read your guide.

402
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:23,440
You seem very interested in Lord Grim.

403
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:25,382
He's my research topic.

404
00:28:25,382 --> 00:28:27,900
I can't believe I met him today.

405
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:29,420
But to my surprise,

406
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:31,260
his whole team consists of noobs.

407
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:33,379
One is terrible with directions, and another is a newbie girl.

408
00:28:33,379 --> 00:28:35,479
Also, the whole team...

409
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:39,440
is poorly equipped and crazy.

410
00:28:40,501 --> 00:28:42,628
What's more, I don't think...

411
00:28:43,631 --> 00:28:45,711
he is a decent man.

412
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:51,320
Is that so?

413
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:52,640
He must be.

414
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,520
Why else would so many players want to kill him?

415
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:57,940
Also, he only had 0.01% HP left.

416
00:28:57,940 --> 00:29:00,000
0.01%.

417
00:29:01,310 --> 00:29:03,430
He doesn't seem like an expert at all.

418
00:29:09,648 --> 00:29:13,180
Then tell me. For someone who is so unreliable and awful,

419
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:15,840
why did you heal him?

420
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:20,108
How did you know?

421
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:26,140
Because... I am "that guy."

422
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,340
Wish you a happy life.

423
00:29:37,310 --> 00:29:38,920
Please use it sparingly.

424
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:50,620
Look, you are my underling.

425
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:53,180
He's my boss.

426
00:29:53,180 --> 00:29:56,300
What should you call your boss's boss?

427
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:58,680
Grand Boss.

428
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:03,054
Does it sound weird?

429
00:30:03,054 --> 00:30:05,365
Then how about "Big Chief"?

430
00:30:05,365 --> 00:30:07,240
Why does it sound so rustic?

431
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:08,840
I got one. I got one.

432
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:11,537
Boss, how about "Top Boss"?

433
00:30:11,537 --> 00:30:13,020
"Top Boss" sounds cool.

434
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:15,480
Do we have to turn our relationship into something like that?

435
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:18,000
Right. I never said I'd be your little brother.

436
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,060
You can't go back on your word. I saved your life.

437
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:22,780
According to my level, I would only lose 875 EXP if I had died.

438
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:24,380
Not a big deal.

439
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:25,320
I don't care.

440
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:27,380
When we're online, you are my little brother Concealed Light.

441
00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:29,220
And little brother Luo Ji offline.

442
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:30,920
Wait for me!

443
00:30:50,411 --> 00:30:52,011
Here you are.

444
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:56,465
- Hotpot! 
 - Are you really Senior Su Mucheng?

445
00:30:56,465 --> 00:30:57,517
Come here.

446
00:30:57,517 --> 00:31:00,280
Mucheng, this is Yifan.

447
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:01,800
Nice to meet you.

448
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:02,662
Nice to meet you, Senior.

449
00:31:02,662 --> 00:31:04,362
Have a seat.

450
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:08,700
So you are Tang Rou.

451
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,360
Luo Ji.

452
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:11,960
You're Bun.

453
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:14,880
Boss, I am so hungry.

454
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:15,980
Can we eat now?

455
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:17,940
Of course. It's her treat today.

456
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:19,591
Help yourselves.

457
00:31:19,591 --> 00:31:22,281
- Great! 
 - Come on, let's eat.

458
00:31:35,911 --> 00:31:37,840
- Cheers! 
 - Cheers!

459
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:48,660
 I can finally see Grandmaster. 

460
00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:51,760
 What will the retired life of the grandmaster be? 

461
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:54,020
 I never thought that my first time seeing Grandmaster's true face 

462
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:56,560
 would be during his retirement ceremony. 

463
00:31:56,560 --> 00:32:00,460
   

464
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:02,560
 Ye Qiu the Battle God. 

465
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:06,640
 Ye Qiu the Battle God. 

466
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,840
Come. Be quick.

467
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:10,560
Hi, Boss!

468
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:12,700
 Ye Qiu the Battle God. 

469
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:15,400
 Ye Qiu the Battle God. 

470
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:22,700
Chairman Tao, well done.

471
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:25,700
Excellent Era lost the competition again last night.

472
00:32:27,930 --> 00:32:29,700
You brought in Rookie of the Year, Sun Xiang.

473
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:32,640
The result? Three losses in a row.

474
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:35,360
Do you know that those journalists wrote about it?

475
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:36,800
You are really something.

476
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:38,280
And you still have the energy to spend

477
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:41,460
on some retirement ceremony for Ye Qie?

478
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:45,160
I never realized you were so nostalgic.

479
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:48,140
Precisely because of the three consecutive losses,

480
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:50,700
it is necessary to hold an event like this.

481
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:52,660
Just like you said,

482
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:56,340
sometimes being nostalgic is a good thing.

483
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:02,370
All right.

484
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:06,060
I hope you can still be this confident

485
00:33:06,060 --> 00:33:08,660
when the fans angrily question you

486
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:10,680
about why you replaced Ye Qiu.

487
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:13,760
Feelings like fury should be released

488
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:16,460
rather than repressed.

489
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:19,900
The era of Ye Qiu has long since passed.

490
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:22,300
If someone still wants to honor him,

491
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:25,620
it will be the last time tonight.

492
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:29,540
I want to tell people that they have to move forward.

493
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:30,920
It's the same for Excellent Era.

494
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:33,000
Chairman Tao, we can start now.

495
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,300
Okay.

496
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:41,580
By the way, I will not let you down.

497
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:43,570
 Ye Qiu, the Battle God! 

498
00:33:43,570 --> 00:33:47,270
 Ye Qiu, the Battle God! 

499
00:33:47,270 --> 00:33:49,220
 Ye Qiu, the Battle God! 

500
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:53,680
 Ye Qiu, the Battle God! 

501
00:33:54,580 --> 00:34:01,180
   

502
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:03,160
 Ye Qiu, the Battle God! 

503
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:06,920
 Ye Qiu, the Battle God! 

504
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:08,520
 Ye Qiu, the Battle God! 

505
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:10,360
 I'm really angry. 

506
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:11,860
 And it‘s the kind that you can't make up for. 

507
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:13,080
 It's a deal then. 

508
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:14,680
 Wherever you want to go, whatever you want to eat. 

509
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:17,720
 I promise that I'll show up whenever you call me. 

510
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:18,700
 I'd like some milk tea. 

511
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:20,500
 No problem. I'll line up to buy for you. 

512
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:22,540
 - I want to eat cake. 
 - I'll make it for you. 

513
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:24,260
 I want to eat hotpot. 

514
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:27,161
 We can go to eat whenever we want. 

515
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:30,020
 Don't be angry, okay? 

516
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:32,140
 Then you have to accompany me more in the future. 

517
00:34:32,140 --> 00:34:34,240
 You can't keep doing dungeon quests. 

518
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:39,600
 - Will your words count? 
 - Yes. 

519
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:46,320
You broke the promise after all.

520
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:51,100
 Ye Qiu, the Battle God! 

521
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:54,668
Tang Rou, here.

522
00:34:54,668 --> 00:34:57,860
When it comes to eating meat, I prefer doing it myself.

523
00:34:57,860 --> 00:35:01,361
Resist all the attacks from you foodies on my own.

524
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:06,260
Tang Rou, you were so impressive when you

525
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:09,780
resisted so many people on your own in Congee Forest today.

526
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:11,480
Thank you.

527
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:15,560
Senior, here. Have some meat.

528
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:18,394
Eating meat relies on seizing.

529
00:35:18,394 --> 00:35:21,091
As for courage, it relies on your heart.

530
00:35:21,091 --> 00:35:24,691
Rather than envying others, it's better to figure out the hotkeys on your own.

531
00:35:27,517 --> 00:35:29,840
Hurry! The meat is fully cooked. Time for full output!

532
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:31,640
Output. Output.

533
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:40,420
I still don't understand how you could create

534
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:42,780
the highest record for Boneyard without orange equipment.

535
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:45,940
It is the most extreme strategy that I could calculate.

536
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:48,280
There are no other ways to achieve it.

537
00:35:55,540 --> 00:35:57,100
Little Brother, enough talking.

538
00:35:57,100 --> 00:36:00,220
Here, have some meat.

539
00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:08,797
The last meatball that was put in three minutes ago.

540
00:36:08,797 --> 00:36:10,400
According to Archimedes' Principle,

541
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:13,160
the meatball will float when the buoyancy is greater than gravity.

542
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:14,940
Floating proves that the meatball is fully cooked.

543
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:16,581
When we were snatching the meat just now,

544
00:36:16,581 --> 00:36:19,180
the pot rotated 273 degrees clockwise.

545
00:36:19,180 --> 00:36:24,301
Therefore, one second later, the meatball will float up in the three o'clock direction.

546
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:34,420
I must say, sometimes math is really...

547
00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:36,020
Delicious.

548
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:09,385
Correct anticipation and exquisite timing.

549
00:37:09,385 --> 00:37:12,014
See, this is someone who sees the big picture and has anticipation skills.

550
00:37:12,014 --> 00:37:16,180
See, this is someone who is full of theories but has no practical skills.

551
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:19,380
See, this is the expert who doesn't get the meatball.

552
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:26,280
See, there is still kindness in the world.

553
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:29,231
She shares the meat with me. True friendship indeed.

554
00:37:29,231 --> 00:37:33,300
By the way, Senior, I finished the TV series that you asked me to watch.

555
00:37:34,157 --> 00:37:37,048
You even know to recommend TV series?

556
00:37:37,048 --> 00:37:38,774
Which one?

557
00:37:38,774 --> 00:37:43,200
"Evasion is useful, but shameful."

558
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:50,640
It's called "Evasion is shameful, but useful."

559
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:55,780
Senior, is it shameful?

560
00:37:55,780 --> 00:37:57,177
Or useful?

561
00:37:57,177 --> 00:37:58,777
Right.

562
00:38:00,008 --> 00:38:01,868
You guys have a tacit mutual understanding.

563
00:38:01,868 --> 00:38:05,260
Next time, please go on.

564
00:38:06,697 --> 00:38:08,140
Cheers!

565
00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:10,420
- Come, cheers! 
 - Come.

566
00:38:12,031 --> 00:38:14,391
Come, eat that one.

567
00:38:14,391 --> 00:38:16,270
The mushroom is done, too.

568
00:38:16,270 --> 00:38:18,262
This one is good. So is this.

569
00:38:18,262 --> 00:38:20,601
 Hello, Old Ye? I gave you the sword that I borrowed. 

570
00:38:20,601 --> 00:38:21,720
 Remember to give it back. 

571
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:23,634
 As Sword Saint, I always keep my words. 

572
00:38:23,634 --> 00:38:25,840
 You better not ruin my reputation. 

573
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:27,620
 Hey, where are you now? 

574
00:38:27,620 --> 00:38:29,420
 Why is it so noisy? Hurry and go online. 

575
00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:31,420
 Let's PK, PK, PK. 

576
00:38:32,014 --> 00:38:33,311
I'm eating hotpot.

577
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:35,160
 Eating hotpot? 

578
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:37,720
 So ungrateful, tossing me aside after you're done using me. 

579
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:39,508
 - How can you abandon your hero to eat hotpot?  
 - Eat.

580
00:38:39,508 --> 00:38:41,425
 - Who are you eating with? And where?  
 - I must say, Sister Tang Rou.

581
00:38:41,425 --> 00:38:44,051
 - Why didn't you invite me?  
 - Invite you? Can you even come here?

582
00:38:44,051 --> 00:38:47,420
 - If you reimburse me for travel expenses, I can consider it.  
 - This is so yummy.

583
00:38:48,205 --> 00:38:50,780
I finally know what you are scheming.

584
00:38:50,780 --> 00:38:53,240
No wonder Captain said you will come back sooner or later.

585
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:56,320
Have you already planned to form a team with the people around you,

586
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:58,697
 - so that you can come back to the League with a new team?  
 - Hey! None for you!

587
00:38:58,697 --> 00:39:01,005
 - Tell me honestly. I'm right, aren't I?  
 - Come on.

588
00:39:01,005 --> 00:39:02,020
 Hello? 

589
00:39:02,020 --> 00:39:04,400
 Hello? Hello? Hello? 

590
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:12,960
♫  As you always are  ♫

591
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:15,500
 Su Mucheng, 

592
00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:19,961
 the gentle and weak little girl who needs protection. 

593
00:39:19,961 --> 00:39:22,020
 After I left Excellent Era, 

594
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:26,920
 she holds fast to her position in Glory on her own. 

595
00:39:29,334 --> 00:39:33,860
 Tang Rou, who has been a winner since she was born, 

596
00:39:33,860 --> 00:39:36,340
 but doesn't dare to face failure. 

597
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:38,140
 After stumbling upon Glory, 

598
00:39:38,140 --> 00:39:40,340
 she learned to accept setbacks 

599
00:39:40,340 --> 00:39:42,660
 and to embrace her imperfect self. 

600
00:39:46,140 --> 00:39:50,040
 Bun, an ordinary person. 

601
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:53,060
 Glory is no longer a tool used to kill time. 

602
00:39:53,060 --> 00:39:57,760
 Because in the world of Glory, he found his new starting point in life. 

603
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:04,980
 Qiao Yifan, a bench warmer who never played an official game. 

604
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:08,280
 But still sticks to his belief of being a professional player. 

605
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:11,300
 He changed his profession with no hesitation. 

606
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:15,260
 Due to his passion for Glory, he's unafraid to deny his past 

607
00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:17,300
 to take on a new challenge. 

608
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:27,500
 Luo Ji, whose life is only filled with endless formulas. 

609
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:30,020
 Due to Glory, he met us. 

610
00:40:30,020 --> 00:40:34,497
 He felt a different kind of warmth apart from numbers. 

611
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:40,520
- Come, cheers! 
 - Come, cheers!

612
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:41,680
- Cheers! 
 - Cheers!

613
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:43,700
 Shall I form... 

614
00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:46,780
 a new team?
