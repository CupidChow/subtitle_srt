Keep us updated.

25
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:40,580
- Don't forget!
- Stay in touch, okay?

26
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:41,310
Don't worry.

27
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:43,760
- Bye!
- Bye!

28
00:01:52,373 --> 00:01:55,840
So you went to see the leader of Team Zhu Xian
to procure materials.

29
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:59,040
Yes. We don't have enough silver equipment.

30
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,280
I could have given you all a surprise.

31
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:05,040
But why didn't you tell us at that point?

32
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,520
No matter what is the reason,
we must do what the Captain arranged.

33
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,990
To keep the morale of our team

34
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:13,380
is more important
than my attendance in the competition.

35
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,980
Then where were you after the competition?

36
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:18,947
It's because of the a thousand-machine umbrella.

37
00:02:18,947 --> 00:02:21,320
Competition is coming. But we don't have much more time.

38
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:24,140
So I visited a lot of teams and guilds,

39
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:26,220
and gathered a batch of basic materials,

40
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:28,460
hoping they'll be helpful to the Captain.

 Subtitles and Timing provided to you by💥🍥 TEAM 7️⃣ 🍥💥 @viki.com 

42
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:00,080
Will they come back?

43
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:05,660
Boss, every professional player
has to face this fork of decision.

44
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:07,560
I already made my choice.

45
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:11,000
Now it's their time to choose.

46
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:17,120
What we can right now, is to give them more space.

47
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:20,100
Give more time to the Captain.

48
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:36,580
 

49
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:39,770
Come back, don't come back.

50
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:44,200
Come back, don't come back.

51
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:49,840
Will, will not.

52
00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:00,000
Ye Xiu. Professional E-sport player.

53
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,120
Now I apply to be the Captain of Team Xing Xin.

54
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:06,260
Hello, I am...

55
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:08,420
Manager of Team Xing Xin.

56
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:12,260
Nice to meet you.

57
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:14,280
We're a team.

58
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:18,160
If there's any difficulty,
why not handle it together?

59
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:26,400
What about a candy? Sweetmeat makes people happy.

60
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:30,420
Or a lemon? Sourness would drive away all your annoyance.

61
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:33,301
Take it easy. Keep steady and don't cut diamond with diamond.

62
00:04:33,301 --> 00:04:34,840
I'll be at your side no matter what happened.

63
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:38,040
It's okay. Come on.

64
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,360
Tonight is the press conference of Night of Glory.

65
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,241
In accordance with the tradition,

66
00:04:58,241 --> 00:05:00,200
both the two teams
who have promoted into the finals of Challenge will be on the stage.

67
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,520
will be on the stage.

68
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:04,860
However, it's increasingly widespread that Team Xing Xin has dissolved.

69
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:08,040
Tonight, we'll know the truth.

70
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:40,380
Boss. It's half past three.

71
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:42,760
Team Jia Shi across the street must have set out.

72
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:46,200
Will we go to the press conference of Night of Glory tonight or not?

73
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,740
We will.

74
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,420
We have to go.

75
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:53,960
Even though I am the only one left,

76
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,780
I'll go.

77
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,480
Is Team Jia Shi ready for the final?

78
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,300
We've already made enough preparation.

79
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:06,760
As for the champion, we're hell-bent on winning.

80
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,980
What about the condition of your team right now?

81
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:10,940
Every teammate enjoys a good condition.

82
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:12,560
Look don't ask too many questions later. Okay?

83
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,560
How could that be possible?

84
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:16,501
- I've got piles of questions to ask. 
 - Haven't we reached a consensus?

85
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:18,160
Hold on!

86
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,640
What's the real situation
of Team Xing Xin right now?

87
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:23,920
If the public got deceived, isn't it unfair?

88
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:33,321
Today, we're here to apologize to you all.

89
00:06:33,321 --> 00:06:37,560
We're disappointing at the last competition.

90
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:41,220
But it's not about the outcome.

91
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:45,280
It's about our poor performance
of facing the reality.

92
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:49,260
On behalf of the team, I apologize to you all.

93
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:51,440
Cheer up, Team Xing Xin!

94
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,060
Besides,

95
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:01,121
thank you to our fans who have been with Team Xing Xin all the ways.

96
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:07,500
As a newly-established team, we're immature in many spheres.

97
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:11,140
Your company is highly cherished.

98
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,480
You're the tinder of Team Xing Xin.

99
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,440
Team Xing Xin will continue to forge ahead.

100
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,920
Thank you.

101
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,700
Wait a second.

102
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,240
- There're more questions need your answer.
- Tell us more!

103
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,361
- Where's Captain Ye?
- Tell us more!

104
00:07:38,361 --> 00:07:40,140
Tell us more!

105
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,920
That should be all.

106
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,680
Where's Ye Qiu?

107
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,640
Ye Qiu.

108
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,460
Let's get in.

109
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:21,440
Excuse me!

110
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:24,260
Thank you. Excuse me. Thanks.

111
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:27,740
Welcome to the press conference
of the highest combat. I'm Luo.

112
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:31,880
Today we'll see the battle array
of the two teams in the final.

113
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:34,780
First, let's welcome the Captain of Team Jia Shi.

114
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:36,260
This team has won three successive championships.

115
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:40,080
Meanwhile, it has been
a wealthy and influential clan in Glory.

116
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,100
Leaf of Autumn, Sun Xiang.
 

117
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:43,720
Sheng Ling Mie, Xiao Shi Qin.
 

118
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,080
Combat Form, Qiu Fei.
 

119
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:47,001
Dancing Rain, Su Mu Cheng.
 

120
00:08:47,001 --> 00:08:48,320
Woven Shadow, Zhang Jia Xing.

121
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,680
Successive Strike, Shen Jian.

122
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,480
Emotionless Magic, He Ming.

123
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,120
Matchstick, Wang Ze.

124
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,960
Qi Breaker, Guo Yang.

125
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,480
Now, let's invite Sun Xiang, Captain of Team Jia Shi, on the stage,

126
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,920
Sun Xiang, Captain of Team Jia Shi, on the stage,

127
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:02,620
and make his final manifesto.

128
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:12,000
 

129
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,400
Facing the competition,
I have one and only choice.

130
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,520
That is to defeat our rival.

131
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:22,720
In the final,

132
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:26,060
the winner will be Team Jia Shi.

133
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:30,760
Well, after Captain Sun's confident manifesto,

134
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:35,120
we'll going to release
the character information of another team.

135
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:38,040
This is a team full of young blood.

136
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,980
But in the Challenge,

137
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:44,400
they have overcome all the difficulties in the way
and got into the final.

138
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:47,760
This team is Xing Xin.

139
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:52,240
This new team has a lot of talents.

140
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,720
Well next,

141
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:58,080
let's release the battle array of Team Xing Xin.

142
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,080
It seems Team Xing Xin is in trouble now.

143
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,920
Or else there won't be just one player.

144
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:05,200
With only one player,
how could the competition continue?

145
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:11,160
Please let me release the our battle array.

146
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:23,960
 

147
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:26,140
Before releasing the character,

148
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:28,120
I have a few words to say.

149
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:33,480
They probably have no connection with the final.

150
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:37,540
If it's not what you would like to listen to, please use some patience.

151
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:40,760
Captain Sun just said that he got only one choice.

152
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:47,020
What I want to say is
that the result of a competition is win or lose.

153
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:48,600
But life is not the same.

154
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:52,800
We can have lots of choices in our lives.

155
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:59,400
Someone can choose to be a stunning pianist.

156
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:03,500
Or to be in the university, as a teacher
imparting knowledge and cultivating students.

157
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:07,000
Or a white-collar in finance
with considerable income.

158
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:12,980
A more promising future or an uncertain today?

159
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:16,720
There're countless possibilities.

160
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:19,560
Each would lead to a wonderful life.

161
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:23,640
E-sport, is just one possibility among them.

162
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:26,461
There's no big difference between it and every other profession.

163
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:29,260
If there is,

164
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:34,840
then it might be the misapprehension as indecent.

165
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:37,220
People might believe
that we are addicted to internet.

166
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:41,100
Years ago,

167
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:44,920
I had to make such choice too.

168
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,720
But you'll find it out.   

169
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,240
Although you chose the Glory,

170
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:53,880
you would still be more choices to make.

171
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:57,100
No matter what choice have you made eventually,

172
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:59,353
it has nothing to do with right and wrong

173
00:11:59,353 --> 00:12:01,440
only if you followed your heart.

174
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,480
And today,

175
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:06,040
just on behalf of me,

176
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,960
I made my choice.

177
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:23,140
Team Xing Xin,

178
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:24,440
Jun Mo Xiao.

179
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:26,680
 

180

 ♫ It's a long and bumpy road towards the top ♫ 

181
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,060
They really won't come?

182
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:33,160
Yeah.

183
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:34,960
How could the competition continue?

184
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,040
 

185

 ♫ Failure is the first light of victory ♫ 
 

186

 ♫ Failure is the first light of victory ♫

00:14:19,761 --> 00:14:22,240
Just like the surprise scene
of the press conference.

214
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,560
Good job!

215
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:24,600
The time is just good.

216
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,660
Without a second's error.

217
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:29,721
Have a seat.

218
00:14:29,721 --> 00:14:31,680
I have something to tell you.

219
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:34,560
It's said that Senior Wei, had sold his account.

220
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,280
Got a pretty penny.

221
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:37,980
Having money is good for sure.

222
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:39,840
But...

223
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:41,440
We'd better skimp on avoidable costs.

224
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:44,360
And a cup free from breaking a cup saved.

225
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:46,380
It's plastic. For you.

226
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:51,180
Who told you I sold my account?

227
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:53,740
Mr. Wei, wish a happy cooperation.

228
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:57,440
Mr. Wei, It's mine now.

229
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,840
You...

230
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:04,860
Let's go!

231
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:23,860
What about Captain Ye?

232
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:25,961
Today only you two go to attend this press conference?

233
00:15:25,961 --> 00:15:28,200
Right, why are they not here?

234
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:35,780
It's been ten years when I first got my account.

235
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:38,380
I can sell anything but it.

236
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:39,860
Tang.

237
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:42,000
This cup is suitable for you.

238
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,440
I heard that you came back to the band, and started your new life.

239
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,520
Teacher.

240
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:00,920
Can I play it again?

241
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:11,200
Now I won't be afraid of starting again at last.

242
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:13,440
Mistake is not horrible.

243
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,700
I completed that piano music
I failed to perform at that year.

244
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:20,800
When the last note finished,

245
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:24,840
I thought I already made my decision.

246
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:29,120
I just passed by, and watched a show.

247
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,820
What about you, Mo Fan?

248
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:35,200
I... I just stay at the crossing.

249
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,700
Xiao An, Luo Ji, what about you?

250
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:41,740
I didn't saw you come back.

251
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:47,040
I just...

252
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:50,303
come back to the campus and took over a class for my university professor.

253
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:55,000
I just recalled that the last digit of the decimal was wrong.

254
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,220
Xiao An, and you?

255
00:16:58,220 --> 00:16:59,920
I...

256
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:04,660
 

257
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:07,300
Help me fill in this blank.

258
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:08,700
You should write here.

259
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:10,080
Here.

260
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:18,140
I was so busy with refusing all kinds of offers.

261
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:21,240
Right. Yi Fan, what did you do?

262
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:25,540
I was staying with you all the time.

263
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:27,300
Yi Fan, quick. Give me that cup.

264
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:29,880
-I have more things about Lao Wei to tell.
- Buddy!

265
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:30,800
- Here.
- Here.

266
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:31,561
- Here you are.
- He knows nothing.

267
00:17:31,561 --> 00:17:32,420
Nothing.

268
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:35,120
- He knows.
- He must know a lot.

269
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,640
Here comes your presents.

270
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:37,421
What kind of presents?

271
00:17:37,421 --> 00:17:38,920
Let me show you.

272
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,360
Let's have a look.

273
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:45,000
What is this for?

274
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:45,620
They're cups.

275
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:50,380
Specially customized. Antiskid,
shatter-resistant and tiff-proof.

276
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:52,820
That's good. I like it.

277
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:55,000
All right. Now you've got the present.

278
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,800
Can I know what's your plan next?

279
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:01,340
Repair a thousand-machine umbrella.

280
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:03,160
Fight for the final.

281
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:09,840
 

282
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:14,120
To repair a thousand-machine umbrella,
we must start from damaging it.

283
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:18,560
I gradually gathered those rare materials before,
for upgrade,

284
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:23,700
but now I have to use the same way to dismantle all materials off the axle.

285
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:24,840
 

286
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:26,840
No detail should be ignored.

287
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:29,921
And every material should be checked.

288
00:18:29,921 --> 00:18:31,440
Until I know what is the problem.

289
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,560
 

290
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,460
 

291
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:49,141
 

292
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:53,420
Captain.

293
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:57,060
Shall we continue dismantling?

294
00:18:57,060 --> 00:19:01,760
Now the umbrella has been dismantled
to its original level five.

295
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:06,740
If we go on dismantling, nothing but the axle could be left.

296
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:11,640
But the axle means nothing.

297
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,760
Back to its original.

298
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:53,760
In fact, having been dismantling it
for such a long time,

299
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,420
you're clear what is the problem.

300
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:02,540
 ♫ From adversity to glory ♫ 

301
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:04,960
What a stupid mistake!

302
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,860
Even a genius can't avoid making mistakes.

303
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:13,100
So what do you think we should do now?

304
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:17,520
I tell you, don't be too reluctant to tear it asunder.

305
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:20,380
No matter how it would change
and what it would become,

306
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:25,540
as long as its name unchanged, it's still my invention. Isn't it?

307
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:34,020
 ♫ I am as always, ♫ 

308
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:41,060
 ♫ writing an ending for the story ♫ 

309
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:44,320
 ♫ I am an ordinary, but more than ordinary ♫ 

310
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:47,560
 ♫ I am at the summit, looking for another summit ♫ 

311
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:50,800
 ♫ We will meet again when the day comes ♫ 

312
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:53,840
 ♫ We are stronger than we used to be ♫ 

313
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:57,160
 ♫ We go through deep and down ♫ 

314
00:20:57,160 --> 00:21:00,280
 ♫ We stand at the starry summit ♫ 

315
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:03,520
 ♫ Now I finally understand what I used to be ♫ 

316
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:04,780
It's the axle.

317
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:07,641
Whatever it is, we'll solve it together.

318
00:21:07,641 --> 00:21:09,900
A thousand-machine umbrella is not your own.

319
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:12,040
It belongs to all of us.

320
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:15,000
We'll divide into several groups
and speed up the repair.

321
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,720
I'm in charge of data modeling, and offer new assemble templates.

322
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:20,521
Wu Chen, you're responsible for sorting out the basic materials you brought.

323
00:21:20,521 --> 00:21:21,960
Mo Fan and Bao Zi, you two assist Wu Chen.

324
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:25,160
And Tang, Yi Fan and Wei Chen.

325
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:27,780
You need to fight for new materials.

326
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:31,600
Everyone got tasks. What should I do?

327
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:34,620
Your job is...

328
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:37,780
To click "Yes" when the weapon is assembled.

329
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:43,700
- Let's go.
- Go!

330
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:45,781
- Let's start!
- Here we go. 
- Okay!

331
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,600
Let's do it. Come on.

332
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,940
Well, from now on,

333
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:54,680
let's start again.

334
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:08,640
Today we have the latest news.

335
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:11,521
Glory official has upgraded the system
to level 75. 
  

336
00:22:11,521 --> 00:22:14,260
That means there would be new Dungeon materials.

337
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:18,840
So far, all the teams including Wei Cao, Ambitions and Lanyu,

338
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:22,280
plan to take this opportunity
to renew and upgrade equipment.

339
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:26,060
Therefore, if we late for a while, we'll lag behind in the competition.

340
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:28,360
So this time, we need to prepare
for not only the final,

341
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:31,740
but the rate of progress in Dungeon.

342
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,940
Come in.

343
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:41,960
Let me introduce him to you all.

344
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:45,140
This is the new member of Team One, Qiu Fei.

345
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:47,520
Qiu has a good data in almost every sphere.

346
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,520
He's always the best in Team Two.

347
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:52,160
He has been exchanged overseas
once representing Jia Shi.

348
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:55,440
His strength is not lower than you in Team One.

349
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,300
Have a seat there.

350
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:04,000
Your profession is Battlemage too.

351
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,900
You two can communicate more with each other.

352
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:08,960
Communicate?

353
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:11,680
I'm afraid the word "teach" is more appropriate.

354
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:22,600
Qiu, this is your seat.

355
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:34,820
No matter it's teaching or communicating, it'll be convenient for you.

356
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:29,534
 

357
00:24:29,534 --> 00:24:31,193
 

358
00:24:31,193 --> 00:24:32,380
 

359
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:35,580
Team Xing Xin got so many first kills.

360
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:37,580
Did you take it serious?

361
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:41,480
Though I was serious,
it's no use with you hindering me.

362
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:48,780
All right.

363
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:51,700
Then let's not compete for that.

364
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:55,300
How about this? He who gets the first kill in the new map
is the winner.

365
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:57,380
Have I ever competed with you?

366
00:24:58,040 --> 00:24:59,720
Naive.

367
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:01,400
Let's compete our output.

368
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,180
I'll let you attack for ten seconds first.

369
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:08,020
Are you sure about this arrangement?

370
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:10,320
His profession is the same with that of Sun Xiang.

371
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:14,200
And in terms of the character,
they can hardly get on with each other.

372
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:18,640
Mr. Tao. Have you ever seen Sun Xiang like this?

373
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:21,240
Though he's not convinced,

374
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:24,420
he is influenced unconsciously by his teammate,

375
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:29,460
both in reality and in his performance in Glory.

376
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:35,120
Playback with double speed.

377
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:41,160
Fourfold speed.

378
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:45,700
Sixfold speed.

379
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:49,320
- Sixfold? How could we see it clearly? 
 - I agree.

380
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:51,520
Eightfold.

381
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:01,460
This is menu. What would you like to order?

382
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:07,060
I'd like this. Just a little spicy.

383
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:08,700
All right.

384
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:19,620
Waitress.

385
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:22,820
I'd like a super spicy!

386
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:26,520
 

387
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:30,480
Taking the opportunity of upgrade in level 75,

388
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:33,440
we've already got much better equipment.

389
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:36,500
But now, the most important equipment that we need

390
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:38,420
is this Blue-white crystal.

391
00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:41,920
This is the crux of repairing a
thousand-machine umbrella.

392
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:43,620
Therefore,

393
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:46,280
please, everyone.

394
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:48,840
The drop rate of first kill in this Dungeon is one hundred percent.

395
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:50,820
We must get it!

396
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:53,020
The First Kill List is empty now.

397
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:54,320
The Boss doesn't have enough blood.

398
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:56,200
Yi Fan, three o'clock.

399
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,640
Roger that.

400
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:06,060
Praisage Guild has got the first kill
in Line Canyon Dungeon.

401
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:09,580
Praisage.

402
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:14,000
Our award of first kill has gone.

403
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,900
Just late for a second.

404
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:20,080
Now every team is keeping attacking level 75 for equipment upgrade.

405
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:23,560
At a result, our first kill was
robbed by those bastards.

406
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:26,400
I don't want to buy it from Team Jia Shi.

407
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:29,100
Then we need to get other first kill.

408
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:31,040
This is the last Dungeon.

409
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:34,660
Actually apart from getting first kill,

410
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:36,800
we have another way.

411
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:38,800
Apart from getting first kill,

412
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,600
there is possibility to get the crystal
in common Dungeons.

413
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:43,340
But the rate is not as high as first kill.

414
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:47,140
Even though all of us keep attacking for 24 hours,

415
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:50,000
we can't get the crystal for sure
before the final.

416
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,500
Who said you are the all?

417
00:27:57,340 --> 00:27:59,500
Come here! Be quickly!

418
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:02,300
Come on! My dear brothers and sisters.

419
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:03,660
Let's have a seat!

420
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:05,320
Quick!

421
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:09,040
We're here with passion, right? We have our mission, right?

422
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:11,020
Yes.

423
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:13,760
Mu Yunshen. Go gather your team. Hurry up!

424
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:15,920
Teammates sit together according to our grouping.

425
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:17,480
That's right.

426
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:21,680
Xing Xin is not only us.

427
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:24,000
Here, attention.

428
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,560
Now it's time for the guild to take action.

429
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:28,380
In every Dungeon where the
Blue-white crystal is possible to appear,

430
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:29,880
we need to keep attacking!

431
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:32,620
- Okay!
- Let's move!

432
00:29:02,841 --> 00:29:04,940
Task time. See details of attacking in notice.
 

433
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:06,900
- Got it.
 - I ensure to complete the task.

434
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:08,820
Three times in the Dungeon. Come on!

435
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:11,480
For Blue-white crystal, come on!

436
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:34,100
Let's see what we have this time.

437
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:36,060
Come on, boss.

438
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:38,760
Other players attack three times within one hour

439
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:41,960
while your team attack once within three hours. Considering this rate,

440
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:44,400
even though we attack till the end of the world, we can't get the Blue-white crystal.

441
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:46,000
But I think it looks good now.

442
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:50,300
You see, the whole cafe is busy.

443
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:53,120
Just like the scene in the opening of District 10.

444
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:56,000
Boss, can I apply for playing in another team?

445
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:00,920
You see, I am the chosen one to get the Blue-white crystal for Master Ye.

446
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:04,480
Boss, you can't hinder me, right?

447
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:06,400
That's too...

448
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:08,200
 

449
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:13,860
Blue-white crystal!

450
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:17,060
We got it!

451
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:21,900
We got it! Finally!

452
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:25,740
That's awesome!

We need to change our places. Go there, quick.

490
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:56,557
Captain.

The sight of your character makes me happier.
