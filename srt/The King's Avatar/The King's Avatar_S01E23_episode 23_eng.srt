25
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,300
It's Yi Fan's email.

26
00:02:11,902 --> 00:02:13,500
Deploying Killing Every Ten Steps failed.

27
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:16,150
Wei Cao Team mainly took the method of attack, supplemented by debuff.

28
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:17,351
It's rival was aced quickly.

29
00:02:17,351 --> 00:02:20,051
Yunxuan Pavilion, no one survived. Overtime.

30
00:02:20,051 --> 00:02:21,971
Miracle, one survived.

31
00:02:21,971 --> 00:02:24,530
It took 28 minutes 51 seconds.

32
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:28,710
- These are the teams that just played with Wei Cao. 
 - Yes.

33
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:31,000
It seems that Yi Fan arrived
at the scene very early.

34
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,800
And he also did a lot of research in advance.

35
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,400
I'll find him.

36
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,851
- Me too. 
 - That's fine.

37
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,400
If he doesn't want to play,

38
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:42,990
it still doesn't make sense
that we force him back.

39
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:04,830
Where are you going?

40
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:07,570
The game is begining.

41
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,100
Who are you?

42
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:16,290
Do you remember that scrap-pick?

43
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:20,300
You robbed Praisage of too much equipment.

44
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:23,100
At first, I thought you were an expert.

45
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:28,430
But, after some research,
I found out that you are a newbie.

46
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,900
You can't even dispell debuff,

47
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:37,090
and need to find game leveling.

48
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:42,100
I am curious to know how you cheated everyone during this time.

49
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:47,500
But, I'm more curious about

50
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:52,900
when so many people watch you to play, what will you do?

51
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,600
Who are you?

52
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:03,470
Take it easy.

53
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:06,350
I just came to make a deal with you.

54
00:04:07,451 --> 00:04:10,000
- How? 
 - That's simple.

55
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,300
As long as you play negatively,

56
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:14,510
and let Xing Xin Team lose the game,

57
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:16,500
how much they pay you,

58
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,800
I will pay you double.

59
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:26,600
As a student in the finance department,

60
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:30,470
you know that this is the best deal.

61
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:32,830
You've got the offer.

62
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:36,390
Why you still saty in a team without future?

63
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:43,700
Don't you tell me that you're gonna help them,

64
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:47,100
and you want to be one of them.

65
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:49,070
Are you done?

66
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:52,730
What I should do. It's none of your business.

67
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:58,800
If I tell everyone about your game leveling,

68
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:02,370
what will they do to you?

69
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:12,400
Either you get our payment,

70
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:16,710
or You lose all reputation.

71
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:21,570
Here are two roads, that you can choose.

72
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:41,010
We get together as a team,

73
00:05:41,010 --> 00:05:42,730
only for one goal,

74
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:45,450
to become real Glory professional players.

75
00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:48,530
Now, the goal is already in sight,

76
00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:50,890
are you really going to get cold feet?

77
00:05:52,910 --> 00:05:55,290
If you don't want to give up,

78
00:05:55,290 --> 00:05:59,310
now play with me seriously.

79
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:06,870
Captain.

80
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:38,350
You are hesitating.

81
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:39,700
Do you want to play or escape?

82
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:41,500
Make up your mind.

83
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:43,550
I don't want to hesitate.

84
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:45,130
Once more.

85
00:06:56,550 --> 00:07:00,190
What comes from hesitation is to be contained.

86
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:02,000
I don't want to be contained.

87
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,600
Continue.

88
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:41,950
You were dominant in the game,

89
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:44,100
now you are very passive.

90
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:46,100
Captain.

91
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:47,470
I don't want to be passive.

92
00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:49,490
What do you want?

93
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:51,290
I want...

94
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:09,300
I want to win.

95
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:13,700
The only way is to fight against me.

96
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:27,970
Yi Fan.

97
00:08:27,970 --> 00:08:30,390
What are you afraid of?

98
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:32,370
I'm afraid...

99
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:40,270
I am afraid that I cannot take responsibility.

100
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:45,800
I am afraid that we lose the game because of me.

101
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:49,030
I'm afraid...

102
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:53,910
that let you down.

Captain.

108
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:18,000
I disappointed you.

123
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:31,630
Welcome to the live internet broadcast of the 9th Tutor Selection of Glory.

124
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:33,220
The Tutor Selection is the basic screening

125
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:34,810
in the Glory Professional Alliance.

126
00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:38,050
Yes, it's more like a teaching guidance than a competition.

127
00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:40,430
The strong team in the Professional
Alliance serves as a mentor.

128
00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:42,510
Every members of the challenge team needs to complete the task of crossing the finish line.

129
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:44,070
Under the interception of the instructor.

130
00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:47,010
Within the set time, one person crossing the line counts a point,

131
00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:50,010
- and finally ranks according to the points. 
 - Captain.

132
00:10:50,010 --> 00:10:52,390
Isn't Yi Fan supposed to fight today?

133
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:55,430
Is he too stressed out to fight against Wei Cao Team?

134
00:10:55,430 --> 00:10:57,300
During two seasons in Wei Cao Team,

135
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:58,990
Yi Fan was very competitive all the time.

136
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:01,390
Although he didn't have a chance to
participate in the official competition,

137
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:05,070
he never stops to compete with himself.

138
00:11:05,070 --> 00:11:07,110
Will he come this time?

139
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:10,530
If he is a professional player,

140
00:11:10,530 --> 00:11:12,270
he will come.

141
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:55,010
The last member of Xing Xin
Team has finished the roll-call.

142
00:11:56,370 --> 00:11:57,990
Another highlight of today

143
00:11:57,990 --> 00:12:01,130
is that Master Ye Qiu enabled a new account, Jun Mo Xiao.

144
00:12:01,130 --> 00:12:03,050
And he chose Freelancer as his prefession.

145
00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:05,030
That's true. Freelancer means no profession.

146
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:06,011
The only thing he can rely on

147
00:12:06,011 --> 00:12:08,410
is the homemade weapon in his
hand, A Thousand-Machine Umbrella.

148
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:11,670
His weapon can transfer its form according to 24 different professions

149
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:14,830
which are under level 20 before they change theire profession,

150
00:12:14,830 --> 00:12:16,190
which means 120 kinds all together.

151
00:12:16,190 --> 00:12:19,211
So in other words, It can change every shapes without cooling.

152
00:12:19,211 --> 00:12:21,550
Both advantages and disadvantages are obvious. His umbrella is extremely difficult to use.

153
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:23,530
Let us look forward to Master Ye Qiu

154
00:12:23,530 --> 00:12:26,970
to watch how he plays
around with every profession.

155
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:33,210
Tutor Selestion First round Xing Xin Team VS. Wei Cao Team.

156
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:34,810
The game is about to begin.

157
00:12:34,810 --> 00:12:36,970
Members of Xing Xin Team, can they reach the destination safely,

158
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:38,630
and win their first game.

159
00:12:38,631 --> 00:12:39,550
Game starts now.

160
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:42,310
Xing Xin Team members marched forward under the leadership of Jun Mo Xiao.

161
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:44,870
At present, all members of Xing Xin Team has completed 3%.

162
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:48,251
I want to know how Wei Cao Team will
arrange interception tactics.

163
00:12:48,251 --> 00:12:51,151
I think, According to the style of Wei Cao Team, their captain, Wang Jie Xi

164
00:12:51,151 --> 00:12:53,590
will surely find the most suitable position to do the ambush.

165
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:54,390
In the Kongzhi Forest.

166
00:12:54,390 --> 00:12:56,531
Lives many kinds of trees, which is a perfect place for ambush.

167
00:12:56,531 --> 00:12:58,330
Xing Xin Team is progressing smoothly

168
00:12:58,330 --> 00:12:59,830
and has not encountered any obstacles for now.

169
00:12:59,830 --> 00:13:01,731
Snapshoting. Wei Cao really did ambush.

170
00:13:01,731 --> 00:13:04,030
The Sharpshooter strikes first.

171
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:06,230
Lava flask. Mu En follows.

172
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:09,170
By releasing skills to contain
movement of Xing Xin Team,

173
00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:15,490
Wei Cao Team seize the initiative.

174
00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:16,991
Xing Xin's situation is not optimistic.

175
00:13:16,991 --> 00:13:18,810
This will seriously delay their progress.

176
00:13:18,810 --> 00:13:21,410
Team HP is gradually being consumed.

177
00:13:21,410 --> 00:13:22,910
Xing Xin is fighting back.

178
00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:26,111
In this bad situation, this is their only way.

179
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:54,691
Nice cutthroat. Successful sneak attack by Jun Mo Xiao.

180
00:13:54,691 --> 00:13:56,530
Magic bomb. He is a Magician indeed.

181
00:13:56,530 --> 00:13:58,430
He can still fight back when he is attacked.

182
00:13:58,430 --> 00:14:00,651
Yes, we can see that Yi Cun Hui is adjusting his position.

183
00:14:00,651 --> 00:14:02,711
The scene is steady. The two sides are into a stalemate.

184
00:14:02,711 --> 00:14:05,270
Wei Cao surrounds Xing Xin. But they are not in a hurry to
start the next round of attack.

185
00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:06,530
The scene is not good for Xing Xin Team.

186
00:14:06,530 --> 00:14:09,610
If Xing Xin is dragged here, their progress will be seriously affected.

187
00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:12,550
And there is no advantage in Xing Xin's HP.

188
00:14:13,890 --> 00:14:16,050
We are cut off.

189
00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:26,730
Now the progress of all
members of Xing Xin is 25 percent.

190
00:14:26,730 --> 00:14:29,790
The Wei Cao Team is looking for a chance to start a new round of attack.

191
00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:32,390
Wei Cao Team has two Witches. They have strong mobility.

192
00:14:32,390 --> 00:14:34,230
If Xng Xin is held back, it will be hard to get out.

193
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:38,210
Only by dragging two Witches, can we get to the finish line.

194
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:42,010
I Can I do it?

195
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:46,530
I' ll hold him off.

196
00:14:46,530 --> 00:14:49,130
Yi Fan. Are you all right by yourself?

197
00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:52,150
Of course. No problem.

198
00:14:55,430 --> 00:14:57,211
We find out Xing Xin leave Yi Cun Hui alone.

199
00:14:57,211 --> 00:14:59,670
Others starts running in the map.

200
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:26,931
Nice! Yi Cun Hui is deploying
the Ghost Array on the tree.

201
00:15:26,931 --> 00:15:28,350
He is a very thoughtful player.

202
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:31,290
This idea of interception is very creative.

203
00:15:33,190 --> 00:15:35,410
The restriction for Wang Bu Liu Xing is very effective.

204
00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:39,071
The Ghost Array on the tree interrupts Wang Bu Liu Xing's pace.

205
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:47,650
Wei Cao Team want to block Xing Xin by controlling HP.

206
00:15:47,650 --> 00:15:50,190
Han Yan Rou and Bai Zi, the Invader are casted with debuff.

207
00:15:50,190 --> 00:15:51,410
Their HP is reducing rapidly.

208
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:53,030
The Cleric of Xing Xin Team should come on the stage.

209
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:54,220
Jun Mo Xiao is in the last row of the formation

210
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:55,990
and helps his teammates cover a retreat.

211
00:15:55,990 --> 00:15:57,770
Nice dodge.

212
00:15:57,770 --> 00:16:01,990
Now they need the Cleric to dispell debuff off their teammates.

213
00:16:04,070 --> 00:16:05,550
Bai Zi, the Invader is casted
by debuff of decelerating.

214
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:06,850
He was hit by this skill.

215
00:16:06,850 --> 00:16:08,470
What is Cold Hands doing?

216
00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:10,710
When they need him most, he
doesn't seem to be in the state.

217
00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:12,250
The players of Wei Cao Team
are still chasing after them.

218
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:13,670
Wei Cao uses skills
to interfere with Xing Xin constantly.

219
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:15,970
The HP of their team is reducing.

220
00:16:24,330 --> 00:16:27,070
Cold Hands doesn't help trammates to dispell debuff.

221
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:30,110
As a newcomer, An Wen Yi maybe this is his first time to play.

222
00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:31,730
He is probably a little nervous.

223
00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:34,350
He didn't see the situation clearly.

224
00:16:35,090 --> 00:16:36,830
So the weakness of Xing Xin is a little obvious.

225
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:40,971
In this way, they might lose the game because of the Cleric mistake.

226
00:16:40,971 --> 00:16:42,850
You go ahead.

227
00:16:46,650 --> 00:16:48,230
Jun Mo Xiao turns back. He wants to help his teammates

228
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:50,903
stop the four players from Wei Cao.

229
00:16:52,890 --> 00:16:54,490
Bao Zi, the Invader and Han
Yan Rou are still sprinting.

230
00:16:54,490 --> 00:16:55,730
But their HP is very low.

231
00:16:55,730 --> 00:16:57,470
It's time for Cold Hands.

232
00:16:57,470 --> 00:17:00,300
- An Wen Yi 
 - Dispell debuff!

233
00:17:00,891 --> 00:17:03,030
Quickly!

234
00:17:06,570 --> 00:17:09,270
At last, Cold Hands take his anction. He dispelled the debuff.

235
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:12,530
Xing Xin will have two players
successfully completed the progress.

236
00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:15,311
What? Why it's invalid?

237
00:17:16,790 --> 00:17:17,750
They died.

238
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:19,590
The HP of Han Yan Rou and
Bao Zi, the Invader is clear.

239
00:17:19,590 --> 00:17:21,730
So they fell before the finish line. What a pity!

240
00:17:21,730 --> 00:17:24,610
Xing Xin's progress has
fallen back from 95 percent to 80 percent.

241
00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:26,690
The ability of Xing Xin Team's Cleric is too poor.

242
00:17:26,690 --> 00:17:28,270
What did you do?

243
00:17:28,270 --> 00:17:31,590
Why you even can't cast
the diepell skill correctly.

244
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:32,950
I'm sorry.

245
00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:35,830
Fine, add blood for me.

246
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:49,190
Jun Mo Xiao haven't given up yet. He is struggling to fight back.

247
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:09,431
Oh, no. Jun Mo Xiao is going to die. His HP is runing out.

248
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:15,211
It's Star Ray. They can't hide.

249
00:18:15,211 --> 00:18:17,530
The blood adding is just in time.

250
00:18:18,210 --> 00:18:21,270
Jun Mo Xiao's HP remains 7 percent. He still alive.

251
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:24,731
The final attack. His HP is running out.

252
00:18:27,210 --> 00:18:30,531
He adds blood again. Back to 10 percent. It is very very essential.

253
00:18:30,531 --> 00:18:32,210
Continue to attack.

254
00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:47,250
Oracle Curing! This pre-read skill is great.

255
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:48,830
Now.

256
00:18:50,470 --> 00:18:52,310
Cold Hands' rhythm of adding blood is very good.

257
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:54,170
The time of casting skills is also accurate.

258
00:18:54,170 --> 00:18:55,530
The skill is really professional.

259
00:18:55,530 --> 00:18:57,530
Compareing with the clumsy dispelling skill we can see the obvious contrast.

260
00:18:57,530 --> 00:18:59,610
Great Healing. Well done!

261
00:18:59,610 --> 00:19:03,531
Now, I understand the value of Cold Hands for Xing Xin.

262
00:19:03,531 --> 00:19:04,830
Good job.

263
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:07,310
That was a good performance.

264
00:19:09,370 --> 00:19:10,590
Split up.

265
00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:12,650
Kill the Cleric first.

266
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:16,631
Wei Cao Team changed their goal.

267
00:19:16,631 --> 00:19:20,350
Because the Cleric brings too much threat to them, so they must kill the Cleric first.

268
00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:44,210
Wang Bu Liu Xing is back.

269
00:19:44,210 --> 00:19:47,211
Magic bomb hit. Cold Hands was been slain.

270
00:19:51,010 --> 00:19:53,931
Lava flask. Mu En is going to restrain Cold Hands' movement.

271
00:19:53,931 --> 00:19:55,410
A Thousand-machine Umbrella In this critical moment

272
00:19:55,410 --> 00:19:58,291
It becomes a shield, and resists DPS.

273
00:20:03,910 --> 00:20:05,590
Run!

274
00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:09,390
He is about to cross the finish line.

275
00:20:09,390 --> 00:20:10,830
Xing Xin is finally going to win the first point

276
00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:13,150
What? Why did An Wen Yi stopped?

277
00:20:13,150 --> 00:20:15,520
Either you get our payment,

278
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:19,550
or You lose all reputation.

279
00:20:20,370 --> 00:20:21,350
What's wrong with you?

280
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:24,430
Run. Why did you stop?

281
00:20:31,310 --> 00:20:33,070
Mu En seized the moment when Cold Hands was dazed.

282
00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:35,250
Magic bomb. Yi Cun Hui. He is back.

283
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:37,410
An Wen Yi, run.

284
00:20:41,610 --> 00:20:45,110
Yi Cun Hui helped Cold Hands then he was knocked down.

285
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:48,811
- Get up. 
 - Yi Cun Hui starts to help Xing Xin's Cleric

286
00:20:54,790 --> 00:20:58,830
But, what is Cold Hands thinking? Why he stand still.

287
00:21:25,130 --> 00:21:27,570
An Wen Yi, run.

288
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:41,550
They did it.

289
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:44,670
The Cleric of Xing Xin Team. Cold Hands. 100% progress

290
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:49,970
Congratulations to Xing Xin for its first win, against the Strong Team Weci Cao.

291
00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:11,310
Chen Ye Hui, I wanna tell you, I'm not afraid of you now.

292
00:22:11,310 --> 00:22:13,110
You can tell them whatever you want.

293
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:16,430
I made this decision at my own risk.

294
00:22:25,550 --> 00:22:28,010
Captain.

295
00:22:32,690 --> 00:22:36,350
Actually, I don't know how to dispell debuff,

296
00:22:36,350 --> 00:22:40,710
I lied to everyone for money.

297
00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:43,950
If you learn to dispell debuff,

298
00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:47,370
you can cover up your lie, right?

299
00:22:48,710 --> 00:22:53,790
But dispelling debuff is not that easy to learn.

300
00:22:55,110 --> 00:22:57,910
Stay! I'll teach you.

301
00:23:07,230 --> 00:23:08,850
Captain!

302
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:13,390
Well done.

303
00:23:14,470 --> 00:23:18,510
Xing Xin Team is a right choice.

304
00:23:20,951 --> 00:23:23,350
Yi Fan! We'll waiting for you in the League.

305
00:23:26,810 --> 00:23:28,270
- Fighting! Yi Fan! 
 - Come on!

306
00:23:28,270 --> 00:23:29,870
Yi Fan, fighting!

307
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:34,490
We'll meet again

308
00:23:39,950 --> 00:23:41,910
at the arena.

309
00:23:44,150 --> 00:23:45,870
Good luck.

310
00:23:56,790 --> 00:23:59,771
Let's have a look at the team we'll battle aginst next time.

311
00:24:02,870 --> 00:24:04,170
Is it my turn? I'll do it then.

312
00:24:04,170 --> 00:24:07,610
Anyway, I'm afraid of no team now.

313
00:24:07,610 --> 00:24:12,030
Yi Fan, did you remember the All-Star Game?

314
00:24:12,030 --> 00:24:15,150
Do you remember the No.1 Ghostblade in the league?

315
00:24:15,150 --> 00:24:17,990
Yi Fan, do you know Murphy's Law?

316
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:29,950
Just kidding.

317
00:24:29,950 --> 00:24:31,810
Blockhead.

318
00:24:32,970 --> 00:24:34,290
What's the trouble?

319
00:24:34,290 --> 00:24:38,370
I believe that sometimes a man should believe in fate.

320
00:24:38,370 --> 00:24:40,790
Whose fate?

321
00:24:40,790 --> 00:24:42,170
Murphy's and your's.

322
00:24:42,170 --> 00:24:44,270
Murphy's and your's.

323
00:24:44,270 --> 00:24:46,731
I'm coming. Here.

324
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:52,230
Any boss who talks about
only feeling but not payments is a bastard.

325
00:24:53,210 --> 00:24:54,650
I've thought about it.

326
00:24:54,650 --> 00:24:57,230
Our team will be more and more normalized.

327
00:24:57,230 --> 00:24:59,730
I'll do what a boss should do.

328
00:24:59,730 --> 00:25:02,270
I'll guarantee each member's welfare.

329
00:25:02,270 --> 00:25:04,570
You're a great boss!

330
00:25:07,030 --> 00:25:09,710
If you have any questions, you can ask our boss.

331
00:25:09,710 --> 00:25:11,050
- I'm fine. 
 - Me too.

332
00:25:11,050 --> 00:25:12,470
No question.

333
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:14,230
I have a question.

334
00:25:14,230 --> 00:25:15,790
Tell me.

335
00:25:17,230 --> 00:25:20,890
I wanna change my period of the contract.

336
00:25:22,030 --> 00:25:23,750
How?

337
00:25:24,830 --> 00:25:26,790
I want to end the contract

338
00:25:29,270 --> 00:25:31,470
until Xing Xin Team become the champion.

339
00:25:34,250 --> 00:25:39,230
 ♫ Writing an end for the story ♫ 

340
00:25:39,230 --> 00:25:42,390
 ♫ Unwilling to mediocrity ♫ 

341
00:25:42,390 --> 00:25:45,650
 ♫ Not limitied by the success ♫ 

342
00:25:45,650 --> 00:25:48,950
 ♫ We've agreed to meet again one day ♫ 

343
00:25:48,950 --> 00:25:52,770
 ♫ I'll coming back with a
larger scale than I left ♫ 

344
00:25:53,590 --> 00:25:57,310
Ye Xiu, Tang, Bao Zi,

345
00:25:57,310 --> 00:26:02,730
Qiao Yi Fan, Luo Ji and An Wen Yi.

346
00:26:02,730 --> 00:26:07,230
It is your hard working that brings Xing Xin to here and today.

347
00:26:07,230 --> 00:26:09,650
Thank you for everyone's joining.

348
00:26:09,650 --> 00:26:12,590
I'm proud of you.

349
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:26,430
Yi Fan,

350
00:26:35,390 --> 00:26:43,090
the equipments you bought for me don't worth it.

351
00:26:48,290 --> 00:26:53,370
You pay them for twice the market price.

352
00:26:58,850 --> 00:27:01,090
We had a game the next day,

353
00:27:01,090 --> 00:27:03,230
but you are lack of equipments.

354
00:27:03,230 --> 00:27:05,690
That's all I can do.

355
00:27:05,690 --> 00:27:11,330
Beside, We can't reach the highest cost performance in every deal.

356
00:27:14,930 --> 00:27:16,590
That make sense.

357
00:27:27,310 --> 00:27:30,350
We shouldn't consider cost performance

358
00:27:31,450 --> 00:27:34,110
when it comes to the fact
that you play game with me.

359
00:27:54,010 --> 00:27:56,390
No thanks.

360
00:28:05,470 --> 00:28:07,290
The game against Xing Xin Team next week, what's your opinion about it?

361
00:28:07,290 --> 00:28:08,830
Dangerous, dangerous, dangerous.

362
00:28:08,830 --> 00:28:10,910
Who's in danger?

363
00:28:10,910 --> 00:28:14,490
Obviously, I'm saying the grass root team you were talking about.

364
00:28:14,490 --> 00:28:15,910
It's the team of your senior, Ye Qiu.

365
00:28:15,910 --> 00:28:19,230
Are you kidding? That guy is not my senior.

366
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:24,210
He is just a little hogweed in my heart now.

367
00:28:24,210 --> 00:28:26,070
Hogweed

368
00:28:28,810 --> 00:28:31,170
which will grow again when spring wind breeze.

369
00:28:32,030 --> 00:28:34,290
No. There is no spring wind at all.

370
00:28:34,290 --> 00:28:37,130
Once they meet us, they can't get any wind.

371
00:28:37,130 --> 00:28:40,431
You should know that, captain, they can rise in rank only if they get five point.

372
00:28:40,431 --> 00:28:42,291
They have no countermeasures at all. They are anxious to death.

373
00:28:42,291 --> 00:28:44,870
- How do you know that? 
 - I've called them.

374
00:28:46,750 --> 00:28:48,590
I've called them to humiliate them.

375
00:28:48,590 --> 00:28:50,270
How dare they rise in rank by beating Lanyu?

376
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:52,150
It is absolutely impossible.

377
00:28:52,150 --> 00:28:54,590
In fact, I don't think you even
need to take part in the game.

378
00:28:54,590 --> 00:28:58,170
I can beat them a thousand times in different way only by using one finger.

379
00:28:58,170 --> 00:29:01,430
I don't need to take part in the game. Why?

380
00:29:01,430 --> 00:29:03,490
Do you think that I am no match for them?

381
00:29:03,490 --> 00:29:05,910
No no no! It's defenitly not what I mean.

382
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:08,031
I mean that you, my captain, don't need to use even one finger,

383
00:29:08,031 --> 00:29:12,470
just your smile will make them shivering, especially Ye Xiu.

384
00:29:13,051 --> 00:29:15,270
However, Lao Ye plays pretty well now

385
00:29:15,270 --> 00:29:18,270
He has both tactics and skills.

386
00:29:18,270 --> 00:29:21,970
Yeah. He plays really well.

387
00:29:22,670 --> 00:29:24,370
But captain you are better.

388
00:29:24,370 --> 00:29:28,010
Look at you, you have not only tactics and skills, but

389
00:29:29,670 --> 00:29:31,350
me.

390
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:32,731
Aren't you better?

391
00:29:32,731 --> 00:29:36,090
So. You can totally handle this competition right?

392
00:29:36,090 --> 00:29:37,890
Right. I think I can.

393
00:29:37,890 --> 00:29:40,490
As long as I 'm here, they shall never think of rising in rank.

394
00:29:40,490 --> 00:29:42,930
I'll beat them like I beat Sun Xiang.

395
00:29:43,970 --> 00:29:46,730
It's up to you this time. Shao Tian.

396
00:30:05,210 --> 00:30:08,910
Lao Ye! Do you know what I've been through right now?

397
00:30:08,910 --> 00:30:10,850
Yu Wen Zhou is not a normal person.

398
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:13,510
He's a devil who can read mind.

399
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:33,430
Are you tired to type so much words?

400
00:30:33,430 --> 00:30:35,830
Do you need some red dates
to help taking care of your body?

401
00:30:46,510 --> 00:30:48,570
Lao Ye, do you know that my captain

402
00:30:48,570 --> 00:30:50,270
is not just a devil who can read mind,

403
00:30:50,270 --> 00:30:52,670
he is totally a ghost hanging behind me.

404
00:30:52,670 --> 00:30:54,350
And you should know that it's all your fault.

405
00:30:54,350 --> 00:30:56,210
You made my training courses doubled!

406
00:30:56,210 --> 00:30:58,670
I am also asked to eat gumbos fried pork meet, gumbos in garlic sauce,

407
00:30:58,670 --> 00:31:01,170
boiled gumbos, gumbos in oyster sauce, gumbos and sashimis,

408
00:31:01,170 --> 00:31:03,450
and the most terrifying
one, gumbos mixed with rice!

409
00:31:03,450 --> 00:31:05,311
That guy now, knowing that I hate gumbos,

410
00:31:05,311 --> 00:31:06,650
asks the cafeteria to cook
food with gumbos delibrately.

411
00:31:06,650 --> 00:31:07,970
They selling them with sliced cold chicken!

412
00:31:07,970 --> 00:31:09,910
I'm feeling myself sticky now.

413
00:31:09,910 --> 00:31:15,210
I really want to follow the
phone line to get to him and kill him.

414
00:31:19,710 --> 00:31:20,990
Calm down.

415
00:31:20,990 --> 00:31:23,470
We should be familiar with his trash talk.

416
00:31:23,470 --> 00:31:25,050
Hello? Are you still listening?

417
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:29,591
Yes, I am. So what is your point except for gumbos?

418
00:31:29,591 --> 00:31:32,550
Right. Now seriously, The Tutor Selection this time.

419
00:31:32,550 --> 00:31:34,850
Lanyu will be serious.

420
00:31:37,910 --> 00:31:40,850
Which means, Yu Wen Zhou will take part in it?

421
00:31:40,850 --> 00:31:42,451
Yes. Not just take part in.

422
00:31:42,451 --> 00:31:44,431
We'll try our best this time.

423
00:31:44,431 --> 00:31:46,890
Think about it. The man who work and rest like an old

424
00:31:46,890 --> 00:31:48,490
stay up late to find tactics against you.

425
00:31:48,490 --> 00:31:50,630
You are the only one who have this treatment.

426
00:31:50,630 --> 00:31:52,530
Don't say your brother isn't loyal to friends.

427
00:31:52,530 --> 00:31:54,330
It's hard for me to give you a
match-fixing when he takes part in.

428
00:31:54,330 --> 00:31:56,791
It's impossible for Xing Xin to get five point anyway.

429
00:31:56,791 --> 00:31:59,870
However, If you beg me, I can keep you in contenance

430
00:31:59,870 --> 00:32:02,470
and let you get through half people.

431
00:32:04,790 --> 00:32:07,350
- What's that voice? 
 - Nothing.

432
00:32:07,350 --> 00:32:11,070
Talking so big that blow yourself up.

433
00:32:11,070 --> 00:32:14,300
Lao Ye, you bastard. You do think I'm talking big right?

434
00:32:14,950 --> 00:32:17,950
Of course. You?

435
00:32:17,950 --> 00:32:19,630
Do you have the qualification
to make a match-fixing?

436
00:32:19,630 --> 00:32:20,670
Why do you bite the kind?

437
00:32:20,670 --> 00:32:22,351
I get nothing paid to be the good guy.

438
00:32:22,351 --> 00:32:24,871
Yes. Lao Ye, you're dead. Let's meet in the arena.

439
00:32:24,871 --> 00:32:26,790
At that time, the one who fail is Sun Xiang.

440
00:32:26,790 --> 00:32:28,991
The loser, Sun Xiang. Did you hear...

441
00:32:32,770 --> 00:32:36,351
The world become peace and quiet again.

442
00:32:36,351 --> 00:32:38,930
The elements that descide whether we could get through include

443
00:32:38,930 --> 00:32:40,190
the moving speed of our side,

444
00:32:40,190 --> 00:32:42,850
the position of the obstacle and the blocking rate of the opposite side.

445
00:32:42,850 --> 00:32:45,491
I've put all of these into my motion model.

446
00:32:45,491 --> 00:32:51,170
The final chance of all five of us getting through is

447
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:57,010
4.444444

448
00:32:57,010 --> 00:32:59,990
That's okay. According to Lanyu's old line-up,

449
00:32:59,990 --> 00:33:03,810
those who most likely stand in front of us will be

450
00:33:05,570 --> 00:33:10,210
Guardian Angle, Ammunition Specialist锘?

451
00:33:10,210 --> 00:33:13,970
Qi Master, and the double core of Lanyu,

452
00:33:13,970 --> 00:33:16,190
the sword and the curse.

453
00:33:16,190 --> 00:33:18,810
Yu Wen Zhou will be responsible for the intercept

454
00:33:18,810 --> 00:33:20,810
while Huang Shao Tian take care of the killing.

455
00:33:20,810 --> 00:33:25,390
So, our rate of fighting back will be very low.

456
00:33:32,870 --> 00:33:35,710
There is someone who can
influence their cooperation.

457
00:33:35,710 --> 00:33:37,310
That's right.

458
00:33:37,310 --> 00:33:40,690
This person must know Lanyu well.

459
00:33:40,690 --> 00:33:42,150
He can fight against Yu Wen Zhou

460
00:33:42,150 --> 00:33:44,790
as well as stop Huang Shao
Tian from finding chances.

461
00:33:44,790 --> 00:33:47,110
By charging he can attack, by fleeing he can defend.

462
00:33:47,110 --> 00:33:53,230
The skills and tactics would better be quite different from Lanyu.

463
00:33:53,910 --> 00:33:57,450
It would be better if he is a Warlock.

464
00:33:57,450 --> 00:34:01,150
Captain, do you mean that you have the choice?

465
00:34:01,150 --> 00:34:05,060
Some old guy should come out to have a try.

466
00:34:10,210 --> 00:34:12,630
The dust on your coffin is pretty thick now.

467
00:34:12,630 --> 00:34:15,350
Do you want to stay inside
until you starts to decay?

468
00:34:15,350 --> 00:34:16,590
Go away.

469
00:34:16,590 --> 00:34:18,270
You grandpa, I am full of beans.

470
00:34:18,270 --> 00:34:20,850
Do not cursing me like that.

471
00:34:22,630 --> 00:34:24,270
You reply in a fast speed.

472
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:26,230
Looks like you are always online.

473
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:27,630
Shut up.

474
00:34:27,630 --> 00:34:29,470
I'm doing business online.

475
00:34:29,470 --> 00:34:31,030
Gaining more than a hundred
thousand Yuan in a few minutes.

476
00:34:31,030 --> 00:34:32,470
I don't have time to tell tall tales with you.

477
00:34:32,470 --> 00:34:34,070
Great, Lao Wei.

478
00:34:34,070 --> 00:34:37,570
You didn't face your midlife crisis. Congratulations.

479
00:34:38,270 --> 00:34:40,510
Get away as far as you can.

480
00:34:40,510 --> 00:34:42,810
Are you still playing Glory?

481
00:34:42,810 --> 00:34:44,210
How old am I?

482
00:34:44,210 --> 00:34:46,630
I'm busy with dealing the business.

483
00:34:46,630 --> 00:34:49,430
I don't even have time to count the odd of my bank account.

484
00:34:49,430 --> 00:34:51,250
How could I have time playing Glory.

485
00:34:51,250 --> 00:34:52,390
What's wrong with you?

486
00:34:52,390 --> 00:34:53,790
Why would you choose to end your term?

487
00:34:53,790 --> 00:34:58,150
Have you figured out that you are willing to live a
life like a normal person?

488
00:35:00,190 --> 00:35:01,510
No, I haven't.

489
00:35:01,510 --> 00:35:05,810
What? Do you still want to play Glory?

490
00:35:05,810 --> 00:35:07,350
I built a team.

491
00:35:07,350 --> 00:35:10,650
Would you like to come with us?

492
00:35:20,830 --> 00:35:24,050
I understand that you are exciting, but do you really need to type with face?

493
00:35:24,050 --> 00:35:26,590
- No, thank you. 
 - Thank you for what?

494
00:35:26,590 --> 00:35:30,610
Why would I give up a rich business and go to play in a team with you?

495
00:35:30,610 --> 00:35:33,430
Don't you know that I was a professional player?

496
00:35:34,150 --> 00:35:36,250
Professional players look decent,

497
00:35:36,250 --> 00:35:38,570
but it's not a job for a person.

498
00:35:38,570 --> 00:35:41,210
I gave up a long time ago.

499
00:35:41,210 --> 00:35:42,870
Life winner.

500
00:35:42,870 --> 00:35:45,490
I do want to see you by myself.

501
00:35:49,515 --> 00:35:53,695
 

502
00:35:56,310 --> 00:36:00,030
Captain, I've found the address of the IP that he's using.

503
00:36:07,150 --> 00:36:09,330
If you are not interested in it, I won't force you.

504
00:36:09,330 --> 00:36:10,550
Let's stop here.

505
00:36:10,550 --> 00:36:12,430
Is it your attitude to recruit talents?

506
00:36:12,430 --> 00:36:14,770
You left me nothing.

507
00:36:17,070 --> 00:36:20,730
Why can you beg me once, bastard?

508
00:36:22,630 --> 00:36:24,810
Did you find out?

509
00:36:24,810 --> 00:36:27,070
Why are you so slow?

510
00:36:27,070 --> 00:36:28,590
Hurry up, please.

511
00:36:28,590 --> 00:36:29,990
Where's my instant noodle?

512
00:36:29,990 --> 00:36:31,830
I'm coming boss.

513
00:36:31,830 --> 00:36:33,670
Here is it, boss.

514
00:36:36,350 --> 00:36:39,711
Got it, boss. The IP he was using is located in this city.

515
00:36:39,711 --> 00:36:41,790
I'll sent you the address.

516
00:36:51,590 --> 00:36:53,830
The real talent is coming to your door.

517
00:36:53,830 --> 00:36:56,590
If you don't accept him, you are a real fool then.

518
00:36:57,330 --> 00:37:02,390
It is his fault to make himself too much enemy.

519
00:37:04,910 --> 00:37:06,830
Good bless him.

520
00:37:06,830 --> 00:37:08,690
Brother,

521
00:37:48,190 --> 00:37:49,830
what is this?

522
00:37:49,830 --> 00:37:53,890
It's a Internet Bar opposite Jia Shi.

523
00:38:00,870 --> 00:38:03,470
Nan Ke Road 147.

524
00:38:03,470 --> 00:38:04,830
It's here.

525
00:38:04,830 --> 00:38:06,630
That's right.

526
00:38:12,530 --> 00:38:15,430
It's not a big company.

527
00:38:18,030 --> 00:38:19,050
Who are you looking for?

528
00:38:19,050 --> 00:38:21,770
Your boss. I'm his friend.

529
00:38:22,330 --> 00:38:26,310
An internet bar. How dare he said it's a team.

530
00:38:35,710 --> 00:38:38,510
Putting these here in front of Jia Shi,

531
00:38:38,510 --> 00:38:41,350
the boss has some guts.

532
00:38:41,350 --> 00:38:43,470
What time is it now?

533
00:38:43,470 --> 00:38:46,630
Does he still have fans?

534
00:38:49,430 --> 00:38:51,910
I am his fan.

535
00:38:58,850 --> 00:39:01,430
I'm also the boss of this internet bar.

536
00:39:01,430 --> 00:39:03,470
Is there any problem?

537
00:39:10,430 --> 00:39:12,370
It's a nice company.

538
00:39:12,370 --> 00:39:15,570
They got a few computers as their property.

539
00:39:15,570 --> 00:39:17,250
Girl,

540
00:39:18,730 --> 00:39:24,430
why are you such a fool
that you choose to be a fan of Ye Qiu?

541
00:39:25,830 --> 00:39:27,890
What do you mean?

542
00:39:28,550 --> 00:39:33,070
All of the fan in the circle of Glory, everyone is better than being a Ye Qiu's fan.

543
00:39:33,070 --> 00:39:35,330
He didn't exist after the competition.

544
00:39:35,330 --> 00:39:38,531
He had no sources and no flow which are bearable.

545
00:39:38,531 --> 00:39:40,670
But why did him choose to leave?

546
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:45,710
Now he's likely to disappear, but the fans have no way to find him.

547
00:39:45,710 --> 00:39:47,790
Spending more than a half of my youth on him,

548
00:39:47,790 --> 00:39:50,670
but I don't know what is him look like.

549
00:39:52,430 --> 00:39:55,410
Once you starts playing Glory,

550
00:39:57,110 --> 00:40:00,090
When is your time to come back, Ye Qiu?

551
00:40:04,690 --> 00:40:07,150
Don't be too sad.

552
00:40:08,230 --> 00:40:11,610
It has been ten years. It's not easy.

553
00:40:13,890 --> 00:40:16,010
However, Ye Qiu will come back one day.

554
00:40:16,010 --> 00:40:18,170
I'll promise to you.

555
00:40:19,430 --> 00:40:23,630
Looks like, you know that Ye Qiu is building a team?

556
00:40:26,310 --> 00:40:28,870
I am the boss of the team.

557
00:40:28,870 --> 00:40:31,790
Your family must be rich.

558
00:40:31,790 --> 00:40:35,671
- No, I'm not. 
 - You must have some relationship with the League.

559
00:40:38,380 --> 00:40:39,710
Why?

560
00:40:39,710 --> 00:40:45,170
No. I want to say that, being a fan of Ye Qiu is already a hard thing.

561
00:40:45,170 --> 00:40:50,590
If you are the boss of his team,
you must have some hardware or software.

562
00:40:51,350 --> 00:40:53,270
Yes, I have.
