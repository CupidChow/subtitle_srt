24
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:36,600
Lao Ye, I've been tied up.

25
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,800
- What shall I do?
- Fine.

26
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,900
You'll be tortured to say uncle.

27
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:42,340
It's your style!

28
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:45,040
Bastard, set yourself against me?

29
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,580
Then let me say uncle now.

 Subtitles and Timing provided to you by💥🍥 TEAM 7️⃣ 🍥💥 @viki.com 

31
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,700
- Sir.
- Why did you save me?

32
00:02:01,686 --> 00:02:04,203
- Sir, was I wrong?
- Absolutely.

33
00:02:04,203 --> 00:02:06,480
You'd run away
rather than spend time arraying ices.

34
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,600
You're so despicable.

35
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:12,726
Tricked me into attacking
before stabbing me from behind. Disgusting.

36
00:02:12,726 --> 00:02:17,935
Don't you know Lanyu was formed
on the base of Containment?

37
00:02:19,994 --> 00:02:21,254
Yi Fan,

38
00:02:21,254 --> 00:02:24,800
let's show him now what the real Containment is.

39
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,158
Yes, sir.

40
00:02:26,158 --> 00:02:31,047
Can't you stop running
away like Sun Xiang, Lao Ye?

41
00:02:31,047 --> 00:02:34,948
Let's fight face to face if you are a man.

42
00:02:50,381 --> 00:02:53,186
Lao Ye, it's unexpected.

43
00:02:53,186 --> 00:02:56,041
You even don't dare face me today.

44
00:02:56,041 --> 00:02:58,887
I'm gonna get you now.

45
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,200
Stop!

46
00:03:15,899 --> 00:03:19,500
What're you thinking about, Shao Tian?
I'm just beside you.

47
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:20,800
Why don't you see me?

48
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,944
So the great Blade Master
has been stuck, hasn't you?

49
00:03:23,944 --> 00:03:26,061
You've got no bottom line.

50
00:03:26,061 --> 00:03:28,500
You're trapping me as if I were a dungeon boss.

51
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:32,400
Lao Ye.
I'll settle accounts with you when I come out.

52
00:03:33,418 --> 00:03:35,211
I'm stuck.

53
00:03:40,246 --> 00:03:43,163
On the other side,
Yi Cun Hui and Windward Formation are advancing.

54
00:03:43,163 --> 00:03:44,900
Brilliant Edge is gonna stop them.

55
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:46,600
Though Xing Xin outnumbers the opponent,

56
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:49,415
they're weak as regards their classes.

57
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:52,881
But Bao Zi appears suddenly.

58
00:03:52,881 --> 00:03:55,350
With his brick,
he's knocked down Brilliant Edge from behind.

59
00:03:55,350 --> 00:03:57,020
It's their typical style.

60
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:58,891
Good job, Bao Zi.

61
00:03:58,891 --> 00:04:02,400
The essence of Containment is
never confronting enemy head-on.

62
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,000
You're a scholar now.

63
00:04:16,379 --> 00:04:22,082
Firing from the roof,
Bullets Rain of Lanyu is trying to stop Xing Xin.

64
00:04:25,555 --> 00:04:28,881
Sir, our path is blocked. What shall we do now?

65
00:04:28,881 --> 00:04:31,066
They've got terrain advantage.

66
00:04:31,066 --> 00:04:33,197
Xing Xin is dodging their opponent's attack.

67
00:04:33,197 --> 00:04:35,050
Using the tactic of Blocking-sight,

68
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:38,318
they've managed to elude the Launcher.

69
00:04:38,318 --> 00:04:39,900
Magic Chaser!

70
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:42,300
Han Yan Rou has defeated the
Launcher and met his teammates.

71
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:44,400
A perfect fight won by Xing Xin.

72
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:47,100
Lao Wei, why are you running away?

73
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:48,983
We've agreed to ambush them, haven't we?

74
00:04:48,983 --> 00:04:52,607
You have the right to be despicable, but your teammates are innocent.

75
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:55,713
What? Am I wrong?

76
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:00,400
We're getting to the destination. It's in the bag.

77
00:05:09,751 --> 00:05:12,622
Before getting to the destination,
Xing Xin is stopped by Lanyu.

78
00:05:12,622 --> 00:05:15,361
The ultimate fight is imminent.

79
00:05:15,361 --> 00:05:16,832
How to fight this time?

80
00:05:16,832 --> 00:05:21,052
I'll show you the essence of Containment.

81
00:05:24,776 --> 00:05:26,700
Wait.

82
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:29,500
Is there anything you know
about your captain and me?

83
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:34,628
Did you see that he was respectful
to me when I entered the room?

84
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,700
Attack now.

85
00:05:40,046 --> 00:05:41,157
Xing Xin made a surprise attack.

86
00:05:41,157 --> 00:05:43,590
Yes, they're fighting excellently...

87
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:46,000
- Good job.
- That's what you teach us.

88
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,300
Being hell-bent is always the best way to win.

89
00:05:55,721 --> 00:05:56,827
Six-light Prison.

90
00:05:56,827 --> 00:05:59,617
Facing the former captain, Yu
Wen Zhou doesn't hesitate at all.

91
00:05:59,617 --> 00:06:02,703
The head-on fight begins... between the captains of Lanyu,

92
00:06:02,703 --> 00:06:05,460
the operators of Swoksaar and the great warlocks

93
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:07,382
To fight a character he used to operate,

94
00:06:07,382 --> 00:06:10,539
I don't know what Wei Chen is thinking about.

95
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:14,500
Captain Wei, how are you?

96
00:06:27,251 --> 00:06:29,800
- Who is the next?
- Me, captain.

97
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,800
Yu Wen Zhou.

98
00:06:33,774 --> 00:06:36,600
- Come here.
- Okay.

99
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:40,300
200 Actions per Minute is the
minimum standard in pro games.

100
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:42,800
Some people can even approach 400.

101
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,600
But you barely reach 200,

102
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:47,400
so you have to rely on your
awareness to compensate for your APM.

103
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:50,400
For example, predict the opponent's next position.

104
00:07:14,127 --> 00:07:17,500
It's a surprise that he's predicted my ambush,

105
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:20,400
and calculated the time I
would spend arriving here.

106
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,519
Interesting.

107
00:07:23,891 --> 00:07:28,211
Well done. I'm just too tired. Do it again.

108
00:07:28,211 --> 00:07:29,865
Okay.

109
00:07:32,071 --> 00:07:35,872
He thought he could defeat
me again with the same trick.

110
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:38,800
A serious underestimation of pros.

111
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,400
Just same as the previous one.

112
00:08:08,989 --> 00:08:12,957
Good job. One more time.
I'll fight you seriously this time.

113
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,900
Thank you for your teaching.

114
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:55,254
You're great.

115
00:08:55,254 --> 00:08:57,183
I'm going to buy a Coke.

116
00:08:59,254 --> 00:09:00,544
He played it steadily this time.

117
00:09:00,544 --> 00:09:02,800
- He's improved enormously.
- Yes.

118
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,600
Captain, where are you going?

119
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,282
To get a Coke, just as I said.

120
00:09:07,282 --> 00:09:11,053
I'm shocked. I can get it for you.

121
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:16,115
But that guy, Yu Wen Zhou,
was so lucky to meet you.

122
00:09:16,115 --> 00:09:19,883
You're building his confidence
by deliberately losing to him.

123
00:09:25,489 --> 00:09:27,468
Keep advancing.

124
00:09:48,061 --> 00:09:51,200
The Arrow of Curse may kill
Windward Formation if he is hit.

125
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,400
But it is stopped by Green Gun from Jun Mo Xiao.

126
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:57,052
How could you attack your
former captain so furiously?

127
00:09:57,052 --> 00:09:58,987
You should respect the elders.

128
00:09:58,987 --> 00:10:01,700
Yu Wen Zhou, let him go.

129
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:04,420
Show your kindness to him.

130
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:09,858
He's been under the shadow
of upset since you defeated him.

131
00:10:09,858 --> 00:10:12,715
That's why he retired abruptly.

132
00:10:12,715 --> 00:10:14,301
Bullshit!

133
00:10:14,301 --> 00:10:16,856
I just wanted to give young people a chance.

134
00:10:16,856 --> 00:10:20,109
How dare you laugh at me
like this? Let me defeat you first.

135
00:10:20,109 --> 00:10:23,569
Are you crazy? You can't hurt your teammate.

136
00:10:23,569 --> 00:10:28,370
I just want to kick your ass. I enjoy it.

137
00:10:28,875 --> 00:10:30,508
This is an explosive situation.

138
00:10:30,508 --> 00:10:33,052
Green Gun is going off, but
the target is Windward Formation.

139
00:10:33,052 --> 00:10:37,096
Though he can't be hurt, it means something is wrong inside Xing Xin.

140
00:10:37,096 --> 00:10:39,568
An internal conflict?

141
00:10:43,303 --> 00:10:46,720
The situation is unexpectedly weird now.

142
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,234
Captain, I'm coming out.

143
00:11:08,234 --> 00:11:12,181
Come on, let's kill Ye now.

144
00:11:31,824 --> 00:11:33,282
Shit!

145
00:11:40,846 --> 00:11:44,709
All the members of Lanyu have
been buried by collapsed walls.

146
00:11:46,734 --> 00:11:50,694
Awesome! The members of Lanyu must be shocked now.

147
00:11:50,694 --> 00:11:53,852
Congratulations! Everyone
in Xing Xin has qualified.

148
00:12:06,276 --> 00:12:09,593
Good cooperation, Lao Wei.

149
00:12:09,593 --> 00:12:11,402
I knew you were prodding me.

150
00:12:11,402 --> 00:12:15,958
If I hadn't perceived your trick,
who would cooperate with you?

151
00:12:17,267 --> 00:12:19,162
When you're playing...

152
00:12:19,981 --> 00:12:21,488
how did you feel?

153
00:12:21,488 --> 00:12:24,523
Cut your crap. Give my
Silver Equipment back to me.

154
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:31,181
 

155
00:12:31,181 --> 00:12:34,741
Bastard, you didn't give
me my Equipment until now.

156
00:12:34,741 --> 00:12:36,423
Weren't you afraid of losing the game?

157
00:12:36,423 --> 00:12:38,394
On the contrary,

158
00:12:38,394 --> 00:12:41,259
relying too much on your weapon
and giving up your own advantage,

159
00:12:41,259 --> 00:12:43,262
you would lose the game.

160
00:12:49,658 --> 00:12:50,999
Lao Wei,

161
00:12:50,999 --> 00:12:55,252
your awareness is more
important to your success...

162
00:12:55,252 --> 00:12:57,093
than your weapon and operation.

163
00:12:57,093 --> 00:12:59,426
Lao Wei, good job.

164
00:12:59,426 --> 00:13:01,814
Mr. Wei, you're awesome.

165
00:13:01,814 --> 00:13:04,452
Your tactic worked.

166
00:13:05,115 --> 00:13:08,400
Now you know what Containment is.

167
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,177
You'll have to learn more in the future,

168
00:13:10,177 --> 00:13:13,815
because I've got many tactics yet to teach you.

169
00:13:14,534 --> 00:13:16,968
I'm thirsty. I need a Coke.

170
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:42,478
Captain Wei.

171
00:13:43,662 --> 00:13:45,606
Good job.

172
00:13:45,606 --> 00:13:47,887
You're better.

173
00:13:51,366 --> 00:13:53,877
I'm not talking about this game.

174
00:14:04,721 --> 00:14:07,935
The year before last, Swoksaar changed his weapon.

175
00:14:07,935 --> 00:14:11,450
With Killing-gods Curse,
he fought against Ambitions.

176
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:15,878
He won the game and just
lost 15% of his Hit Points.

177
00:14:15,878 --> 00:14:18,076
Everyone was stunned.

178
00:14:18,076 --> 00:14:20,030
The upgrading of weapons last year...

179
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:23,650
lifted Swoksaar's attack by two levels.

180
00:14:26,721 --> 00:14:30,696
The final in which Lanyu won
the championship was pretty good.

181
00:14:30,696 --> 00:14:32,397
The audience...

182
00:14:38,062 --> 00:14:41,078
In a word, you have been
playing well in recent years.

183
00:14:41,078 --> 00:14:44,512
You deserve to be called the First Warlock.

184
00:14:48,052 --> 00:14:50,702
Swoksaar was passed on to me by you.

185
00:14:50,702 --> 00:14:53,090
And you taught me how to play.

186
00:14:53,090 --> 00:14:55,842
What I passed on to you was just an account.

187
00:14:57,780 --> 00:15:03,060
The person making him success in League is you.

188
00:15:04,026 --> 00:15:05,873
Speaking of teaching,

189
00:15:07,057 --> 00:15:08,963
it seemed I didn't do it.

190
00:15:14,896 --> 00:15:17,457
Do you remember when you and
Shao Tian played the guiding game...

191
00:15:17,457 --> 00:15:20,060
in the training-room?

192
00:15:20,704 --> 00:15:24,151
When Troubling Rain was locked
by Swoksaar's Six-light Prison,

193
00:15:25,465 --> 00:15:27,683
you told Shao Tian:

194
00:15:28,655 --> 00:15:32,972
"Though I can't see you
because you're behind the rock,

195
00:15:32,972 --> 00:15:35,853
not only can I guess what your next step will be,

196
00:15:35,853 --> 00:15:39,943
but calculate the position you'll move to, and the time you need.

197
00:15:39,943 --> 00:15:41,304
This is predicting.

198
00:15:41,304 --> 00:15:45,377
It's an ability that every warlock
has to practice and master."

199
00:15:45,377 --> 00:15:46,735
It's like what I said then.

200
00:15:46,735 --> 00:15:50,930
You took care of every trainee
and taught them diligently.

201
00:15:50,930 --> 00:15:53,369
That made me raise my hand...

202
00:15:53,930 --> 00:15:55,698
to ask you for a game.

203
00:15:56,572 --> 00:15:59,809
As I said, I had never taught you.

204
00:16:00,492 --> 00:16:04,384
You've got an exceptional talent.

205
00:16:05,007 --> 00:16:07,092
Though I won the game,

206
00:16:07,705 --> 00:16:10,141
I had learned all your tactics.

207
00:16:10,141 --> 00:16:12,514
I couldn't succeed without you.

208
00:16:12,514 --> 00:16:16,342
It was your inspiration that brought me here.

209
00:16:18,666 --> 00:16:20,904
For these years,

210
00:16:23,883 --> 00:16:26,330
I've always wanted to tell you...

211
00:16:35,174 --> 00:16:37,994
Thank you, captain.

212
00:16:42,585 --> 00:16:44,313
Yu Wen Zhou.

213
00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:48,826
Passing Lanyu and Swoksaar on to you...

214
00:16:52,502 --> 00:16:54,746
was a right thing I did.

215
00:16:58,803 --> 00:17:02,334
Mr. Wei, Mr. Wei...

216
00:17:02,334 --> 00:17:03,729
Sir...

217
00:17:04,484 --> 00:17:06,666
In order to prevent you from disappearing again,

218
00:17:06,666 --> 00:17:09,181
I bought all kinds of Coke for you.

219
00:17:09,181 --> 00:17:12,348
See? Flavor of ginger, vanilla,
the best-selling blue one,

220
00:17:12,348 --> 00:17:14,372
and the pink cherry flavor you like best.

221
00:17:14,372 --> 00:17:17,232
But promise: never run away again.

222
00:17:22,056 --> 00:17:25,282
This time, I won't.

223
00:17:30,634 --> 00:17:34,879
Mr. Wei's tactics are still unorthodox.

224
00:17:34,879 --> 00:17:36,902
But...

225
00:17:36,902 --> 00:17:38,441
I like them.

226
00:17:38,441 --> 00:17:39,907
Really?

227
00:17:44,091 --> 00:17:45,724
So do I.

228
00:18:02,825 --> 00:18:05,475
Leaving Lanyu and quitting Glory...

229
00:18:05,475 --> 00:18:09,711
Do you think...it's a bad decision then?

230
00:18:09,711 --> 00:18:12,740
Why do you like to talk such nonsense?

231
00:18:13,441 --> 00:18:16,655
The defeat still haunts you, doesn't it?

232
00:18:16,655 --> 00:18:22,051
The defeat was really one of
the main reasons why I retired.

233
00:18:22,051 --> 00:18:24,463
Denying it...

234
00:18:24,463 --> 00:18:27,082
because I don't want to admit it.

235
00:18:27,082 --> 00:18:30,667
I'd have been playing in Glory
for another two or three years.

236
00:18:32,826 --> 00:18:35,492
But it was impossible.

237
00:18:35,492 --> 00:18:39,181
My time has passed.

238
00:18:42,809 --> 00:18:46,883
If you like, anything is possible.

239
00:18:48,281 --> 00:18:50,669
Do you think...

240
00:18:50,669 --> 00:18:53,411
I am still as good as I used to be?

241
00:18:56,745 --> 00:19:00,227
It's true that tactics and
people would be out of date.

242
00:19:00,816 --> 00:19:03,014
But all the tactics are
created by the successors...

243
00:19:03,014 --> 00:19:06,545
standing on the shoulders of their predecessors.

244
00:19:06,545 --> 00:19:08,457
Being outdated may be an disadvantage,

245
00:19:08,457 --> 00:19:10,330
but it can be transformed into an advantage.

246
00:19:10,330 --> 00:19:12,568
Yu Wen Zhou understood it then.

247
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:14,955
Don't you understand it now?

248
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,875
So you really lost to him.

249
00:19:29,458 --> 00:19:34,107
These kids can easily surpass me.

250
00:19:36,975 --> 00:19:39,552
So can the kids under you.

251
00:19:41,041 --> 00:19:44,036
I thought they would ignore the old tactics.

252
00:19:45,266 --> 00:19:47,702
But, it turned out...

253
00:19:47,702 --> 00:19:50,780
the game made me excited when I was playing.

254
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:59,366
So...join Xing Xin?

255
00:20:08,214 --> 00:20:13,093
 

256
00:20:13,093 --> 00:20:14,894
 

257
00:20:14,894 --> 00:20:16,298
 

258
00:20:16,298 --> 00:20:18,591
 

259
00:20:18,591 --> 00:20:21,657
We have qualified.

260
00:20:23,484 --> 00:20:25,292
Really?

261
00:20:25,292 --> 00:20:28,522
Jia Shi is the first, and we are the last.

262
00:20:28,522 --> 00:20:30,895
It's humiliating.

263
00:20:30,895 --> 00:20:34,202
So you have to practice diligently.

264
00:20:36,930 --> 00:20:40,478
Our ranking is not good, but we've qualified.

265
00:20:40,478 --> 00:20:44,156
That means the first and the
last are on the same starting line.

266
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:49,306
Okay, that's all for today.

267
00:20:49,306 --> 00:20:50,606
 

268
00:20:50,606 --> 00:20:52,383
Thank you.
 

269
00:20:52,383 --> 00:20:56,621
Captain Xiao. Our team won the first in the Tutor Selection.

270
00:20:56,621 --> 00:20:58,795
- We should celebrate, okay?
- Yes.

271
00:20:58,795 --> 00:21:00,406
Let's go to Eagle's Nest.

272
00:21:00,406 --> 00:21:01,794
- Okay.
- Good.

273
00:21:01,794 --> 00:21:03,167
Though we can't drink,
 

274
00:21:03,167 --> 00:21:04,706
we can enjoy the food.

275
00:21:04,706 --> 00:21:06,648
Xing Xin has qualified, too.

276
00:21:07,506 --> 00:21:09,267
It's par for the course.

277
00:21:09,267 --> 00:21:11,376
We'll meet them some day.

278
00:21:12,338 --> 00:21:14,439
That's not necessarily true.

279
00:21:16,369 --> 00:21:19,249
You go to celebrate. I've got something to do.

280
00:21:21,119 --> 00:21:23,761
20 teams qualifying for the Challenge have emerged. 
  

281
00:21:23,761 --> 00:21:25,840
But a private arrangement has been made...

282
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:28,776
between Jia Shi, rated No.1,
and Xing Xin, rated No.20.

283
00:21:28,776 --> 00:21:30,776
They're going to have an extra game,

284
00:21:30,776 --> 00:21:34,787
whose result will affect
Xing Xin's advancing in the League.

285
00:21:45,507 --> 00:21:50,673
Although it conforms to the rules,
the Demolish style is opportunistic.

286
00:21:50,673 --> 00:21:52,593
I didn't know until today...

287
00:21:52,593 --> 00:21:56,171
that Xing Xin succeeded in qualifying
with this tactic.

288
00:21:57,029 --> 00:22:01,876
Why are you coming back
with such an embarrassed manner?

289
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:05,914
Captain Sun.

290
00:22:05,914 --> 00:22:08,218
It's more meaningful
to study your opponent's tactics...

291
00:22:08,218 --> 00:22:10,266
than to laugh at them.

292
00:22:10,266 --> 00:22:15,080
Besides, I'm here today just as a friend,

293
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:19,430
not the Chairman of League, okay?

294
00:22:19,431 --> 00:22:21,065
A stolen win.

295
00:22:21,065 --> 00:22:23,644
- Shameful.
- Is Jia Shi scared...

296
00:22:24,204 --> 00:22:25,700
that I'm coming back?

297
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:28,300
Captain Ye, what's your point?

298
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:30,000
You don't know us.

299
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,500
We haven't had a fight yet.

300
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:33,098
So let's have a fight.

301
00:22:33,098 --> 00:22:35,632
The problem of strength
should be solved by strength.

302
00:22:35,632 --> 00:22:37,200
I'm afraid...

303
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:40,300
you won't win anyone in my team without cheating.

304
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:44,210
Captain Ye, do you dare to fight?

305
00:22:45,634 --> 00:22:50,200
If Xing Xin fails,
it will voluntarily withdraw from Challenge.

306
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:52,800
I'd also like to know...

307
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:55,207
if you've got the strength qualifying
for Challenge.

308
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:59,400
Sooner or later,
we'll inevitably fight against Jia Shi.

309
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:03,200
This fight is an excellent opportunity
to practice.

310
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:06,268
We're gonna have a real fight
with the real pro team.

311
00:23:06,268 --> 00:23:09,200
Only in this way can we expose
all our problems and shortcomings.

312
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:12,600
This fight, we have to take.

313
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:13,874
Mr. Tao.

314
00:23:13,874 --> 00:23:15,700
Do you have any idea

315
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:19,400
why Sun Xiang strongly proposed
to have a fight with Xing Xin?

316
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:22,000
Since his transfer to Jia Shi,
 

317
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,200
Sun Xiang has in fact been
thinking of beating Ye Qiu.

318
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:27,900
Captain Ye Qiu left Jia Shi,

319
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:30,900
and Sun, the best rookie, became the new leader.

320
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:33,331
It's a big pressure for him.

321
00:23:33,331 --> 00:23:35,667
Now Jia Shi has been demoted into the Challenge.

322
00:23:35,667 --> 00:23:38,500
Sun Xiang is surely feeling more stressed.

323
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,200
He's making trouble with Ye Qiu.

324
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:43,900
He's anxious to prove that
he is as good as Ye Qiu.

325
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:46,500
Stubbornness will stick into the subconscious...

326
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:49,165
after existing for a long time.

327
00:23:49,165 --> 00:23:51,545
This would be a fatal problem...

328
00:23:51,545 --> 00:23:54,045
in the Challenge.

329
00:23:54,045 --> 00:23:56,346
Not only Sun Xiang,

330
00:23:56,346 --> 00:23:59,397
but everyone in Jia Shi thinks so.

331
00:24:00,401 --> 00:24:02,242
Though Ye retired from Jia Shi,

332
00:24:02,242 --> 00:24:06,091
his imprint left in it is too deep.

333
00:24:06,091 --> 00:24:08,392
We've been fighting against his shadow.

334
00:24:08,392 --> 00:24:11,295
This is bound to affect our own pace.

335
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:15,400
So, in your opinion,

336
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:18,168
what should Jia Shi do now?

337
00:24:18,168 --> 00:24:21,200
Defeating Ye is just a small
step on our way to championship.

338
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,700
We can strategically despise our opponent,

339
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:26,691
but have to tactically attach weight to them.

340
00:24:26,691 --> 00:24:28,503
But...

341
00:24:28,503 --> 00:24:30,664
if Xing Xin wins...

342
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:36,500
Then it would rather be an encouragement for Sun.

343
00:24:39,158 --> 00:24:42,400
Sooner or later, we'll fight against Jia Shi.

344
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:45,700
The extra game is our best
chance to investigate our opponent.

345
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:47,109
Luo Ji, it's your turn.

346
00:24:47,109 --> 00:24:49,864
Though we need to kill just one player...
 

347
00:24:49,864 --> 00:24:51,338
in the fight against Jia Shi,

348
00:24:51,338 --> 00:24:56,631
we'll be under much greater
pressure than usual because of him,

349
00:24:58,500 --> 00:24:59,900
Xiao Shi Qin.

350
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:03,347
Like our captain, he is one
of the Four Best Tacticians.

351
00:25:03,347 --> 00:25:07,173
There are few flaws in his
awareness and operation.

352
00:25:07,173 --> 00:25:10,900
He's always been the leader
in the previous team games.

353
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:14,300
Jia Shi neglected tactics before Xiao joined it,
 

354
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:16,863
so it always lost in team games.

355
00:25:16,863 --> 00:25:19,863
But everything has changed since he joined it.

356
00:25:19,863 --> 00:25:25,089
He is now claimed to be the
central core in Team Jia Shi.

357
00:25:26,284 --> 00:25:28,684
How to defeat them? 
  

358
00:25:28,684 --> 00:25:31,659
Cut the central core off, then smash it.

359
00:25:31,659 --> 00:25:34,966
Cool. Who will do it?

360
00:25:34,966 --> 00:25:41,200
The weakness of Mechanics is
that they are slower and less HP.

361
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:44,108
We need a character who
is highly explosive and lethal,

362
00:25:44,108 --> 00:25:47,037
and can launch a surprise
attack to kill him with one blow.

363
00:25:47,037 --> 00:25:50,728
It's better if he is very
familiar with the terrain,

364
00:25:50,728 --> 00:25:53,033
so he can hide himself if necessary.

365
00:25:53,033 --> 00:25:54,909
That would be perfect.

366
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:58,100
I've got a candidate.

367
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:25,900
Take it easy.

368
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:27,901
I'm not here to fight.

369
00:26:28,736 --> 00:26:31,828
Do you know Team Xing Xin?

370
00:26:40,039 --> 00:26:42,768
You should know eSports...

371
00:26:42,768 --> 00:26:45,204
and I'm the Bossy Captain.

372
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:11,600
He's stubborn as a mule.

373
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,559
That's a problem.

374
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,500
You've got a girlfriend?

375
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:22,706
- Yes.
- How do you feel?

376
00:27:22,706 --> 00:27:24,621
It's hard to say...

377
00:27:24,621 --> 00:27:26,801
There's nothing hard about it.

378
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:30,100
Are you messing around with me?

379
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:31,857
Such a useless boy!

380
00:27:31,857 --> 00:27:34,906
Is he really "Deception"?

381
00:27:34,906 --> 00:27:37,778
His real name is Mo Fan, the cashier of the cafe.

382
00:27:37,778 --> 00:27:41,709
My information has always been accurate.

383
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:47,138
You don't think he is too old, do you?

384
00:27:47,138 --> 00:27:50,300
Playing Glory in his age means he loves the game.

385
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:52,200
- But...
- Are you blind?

386
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:54,788
- He's too fat.
- Don't you see me here?

387
00:27:54,788 --> 00:27:59,544
In fact he's very agile, and
you can see it from his Ninja.

388
00:27:59,544 --> 00:28:01,086
Now!

389
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:03,800
Such an asshole!

390
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:06,423
- He's too fierce.
- Fierce?

391
00:28:06,423 --> 00:28:08,689
A Ninja has to be fierce.

392
00:28:08,689 --> 00:28:12,300
If he's not fierce, how could
he break into enemy's camps?

393
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:15,460
Sir, what shall we do now?

394
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:18,900
He's a fierce and grim guy,

395
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:21,300
so we can't confront him.

396
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:25,100
We should influence him.

397
00:28:28,044 --> 00:28:29,901
Do it now.

398
00:28:39,643 --> 00:28:41,100
What?

399
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:45,300
It's your duty, Bossy Captain.

400
00:29:05,405 --> 00:29:08,066
Hi, I'm Jun Mo Xiao.

401
00:29:09,658 --> 00:29:13,158
Mr. Jun, what can I do for you?

402
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:16,800
Three cups of...

403
00:29:18,879 --> 00:29:20,929
Flat White.

404
00:29:20,929 --> 00:29:22,798
 
 

405
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:27,800
I want Flat White, not Americano.

406
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:32,218
It doesn't matter here. Take it easy.

407
00:29:32,218 --> 00:29:34,038
Three Flat Whites.

408
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:37,600
- Buddy, are you...
- Boss!

409
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:42,300
Sir, what're you doing here?

410
00:29:42,917 --> 00:29:45,718
Just passing by.

411
00:29:47,042 --> 00:29:48,719
Wait.

412
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:55,100
Let me see...

413
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:57,404
They are Flat Whites,

414
00:29:57,404 --> 00:29:59,388
but on the bill, it's the price of Americano.

415
00:29:59,388 --> 00:30:01,800
What the hell is it?

416
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,200
You!

417
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:05,598
What the hell is it?

418
00:30:05,598 --> 00:30:07,100
What's your name?

419
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:10,100
Sir, come here.

420
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:13,355
Sir. Take a seat.

421
00:30:13,355 --> 00:30:14,678
Sir.

422
00:30:14,678 --> 00:30:18,471
He's a rookie who knows nothing.

423
00:30:18,471 --> 00:30:21,100
It's all my fault.

424
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:24,300
Mr. Liu, you're too kind.

425
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:27,318
- Here you are.
- How could you manage the cafe like this?

426
00:30:28,016 --> 00:30:30,578
Last time, it was me who found out...

427
00:30:30,578 --> 00:30:34,649
some employee was swapping our goods in kitchen.

428
00:30:34,649 --> 00:30:39,639
Listen: every rookie has to be scrutinized.

429
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:42,500
Come here.

430
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:44,304
Now!

431
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:47,100
Apologize to our boss.

432
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:49,700
Cut your crap!

433
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:52,000
Is this a problem you can fix with an apology?

434
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,769
You, bring me all the bills here.

435
00:30:54,769 --> 00:30:56,589
Let me check them.

436
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:10,200
Sir, raise your foot.

437
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
Glory Card.

438
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,971
I see.

439
00:31:23,971 --> 00:31:26,101
You've been embezzling the money in cafe,

440
00:31:26,101 --> 00:31:28,188
to buy equipments in Glory?

441
00:31:28,188 --> 00:31:30,294
I shouldn't have trusted you!

442
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:37,400
How dare you snatch the card?

443
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:39,449
Don't you want the job?

444
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:53,800
Shit. He's gone away. Mo Fan is him.

445
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:56,058
Let him go. He is a mute kid.

446
00:31:56,058 --> 00:31:58,656
He maybe won't express clearly
his coordinates during the game.

447
00:31:58,656 --> 00:32:00,171
Forget him.

448
00:32:00,171 --> 00:32:02,250
No, we need him.

449
00:32:02,250 --> 00:32:04,200
But...

450
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:07,900
a special guy has to be
recruited in a special way.

451
00:32:17,097 --> 00:32:18,417
I'm coming.

452
00:32:18,417 --> 00:32:21,464
Don't worry. I've got everything.

453
00:32:28,816 --> 00:32:34,560
 

454
00:32:48,622 --> 00:32:50,490
 

455
00:33:17,141 --> 00:33:18,744
Wanting a guy like him to talk,

456
00:33:18,744 --> 00:33:22,400
you must start with something he knows well.

457
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:24,700
If Glory is the only thing he cares about,

458
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:28,320
we'll have a chance to recruit him.

459
00:33:36,204 --> 00:33:39,542
What do you think about joining Xing Xin?

460
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:22,800
Join us?

461
00:34:37,535 --> 00:34:39,456
 

462
00:34:52,558 --> 00:34:54,400
No way to escape.

463
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:56,400
Want to be killed again?

464
00:35:14,398 --> 00:35:18,334
Your tactic has forced him to kill himself.

465
00:35:18,334 --> 00:35:21,747
Even as a senior opportunist, I can't do this.

466
00:35:21,747 --> 00:35:25,607
If a tactic works, it doesn't
matter whether it's dirty or not.

467
00:35:25,607 --> 00:35:28,700
If Glory has something very special for him,

468
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:32,200
I have to destroy the special element.

469
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:36,112
However, he'll be downgraded in this way.

470
00:35:36,112 --> 00:35:40,549
Then, even if he is recruited,
he won't be able to compete.

471
00:35:44,303 --> 00:35:46,295
Fair enough.

472
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:55,900
Think about it.

473
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:57,832
Join us.

474
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:01,300
Forget it.

475
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:42,900
He'll never escape the well.

476
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:46,508
What a torment! But I like it.

477
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,900
He wants to kill himself.

478
00:37:12,607 --> 00:37:16,187
Sometimes, it's also not easy to die.

479
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:29,600
How are you feeling as
being trapped inside the well?

480
00:37:30,736 --> 00:37:33,994
You're crazy. What do you want from me?

481
00:37:35,847 --> 00:37:39,077
From now on, the well is your only area

482
00:37:39,077 --> 00:37:41,100
you can move freely in Glory.

483
00:37:46,387 --> 00:37:48,300
It's the address of our team.

484
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:52,200
If you want to join us or seek revenge, come here.

485
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:55,337
Of course, I personally hope you'll join us,

486
00:37:55,337 --> 00:37:57,578
because I don't like to fight a rookie.

487
00:37:57,578 --> 00:37:59,479
Right?

488
00:37:59,479 --> 00:38:02,018
Xing Xin Net Cafe.

489
00:38:05,598 --> 00:38:08,161
Look, he is off line.

490
00:38:08,161 --> 00:38:09,859
We're waiting.

491
00:38:09,859 --> 00:38:11,100
He'll be back.

492
00:38:43,027 --> 00:38:45,308
Bao Zi, it's your turn.

493
00:39:10,312 --> 00:39:12,026
Hi, we meet again.

494
00:39:12,026 --> 00:39:15,941
Windy or rainy, I'll always
be waiting for you here.

495
00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:21,505
Okay.

496
00:39:52,278 --> 00:39:58,785
 

497
00:40:00,348 --> 00:40:02,911
I'll take back my Glory.

498
00:40:04,589 --> 00:40:09,055
In other companies, I heard something called "Team Building",

499
00:40:09,055 --> 00:40:11,054
which is very useful.

500
00:40:12,121 --> 00:40:13,874
Jun Mo Xiao.

501
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:24,100
Welcome to Xing Xin.

502
00:40:29,022 --> 00:40:30,442
Sporting area.

503
00:40:30,442 --> 00:40:33,592
You can relax here during training.

504
00:40:34,767 --> 00:40:36,400
Massage chairs.

505
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:38,100
I like them.

506
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:43,600
This is where everyone practices.

507
00:40:44,416 --> 00:40:45,884
This is our power supply.

508
00:40:45,884 --> 00:40:48,090
Never touch it when you're training.

509
00:40:48,090 --> 00:40:50,984
Otherwise, all the computers will be dead.

510
00:40:52,908 --> 00:40:55,904
- You got it?
- Yes.

511
00:40:59,575 --> 00:41:02,265
Everyone's account card is kept here.

512
00:41:02,265 --> 00:41:04,384
So is yours.

513
00:41:07,384 --> 00:41:11,071
Who was so careless, putting my Jun Mo Xiao here?

514
00:41:11,071 --> 00:41:15,681
If I lose it,
I'll lose the most precious Umbrella in Glory.

515
00:41:21,867 --> 00:41:23,247
I'm done.

516
00:41:23,247 --> 00:41:24,810
Go around here by yourself.

517
00:41:24,810 --> 00:41:26,344
Okay.

518
00:41:28,130 --> 00:41:38,120
