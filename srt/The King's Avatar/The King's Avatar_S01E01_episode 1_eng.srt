27
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:43,762
- Everyone, welcome to the world of Glory. 
 - The world of Glory.

28
00:02:43,762 --> 00:02:45,337
   

29
00:02:45,337 --> 00:02:46,629
   

30
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:49,950
   

31
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:57,280
 In this arena, hard work is nothing to brag about. 

32
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,900
 It is the bare minimum. 

33
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:02,260
 Anyone can work hard. 

34
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:04,140
 It's the bottom line. 

35
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:06,880
 It's the most trivial thing. 

36
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:10,840
 Only when you understand this, can you reach the top. 

37
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,000
 Team Excellent Era, 

38
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,440
 the only team that won three consecutive championships in the Glory Professional Alliance's history, 

39
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:17,540
 ushered in a new era in Glory. 

40
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,080
 Team Blue Rain, adapting a strategy built around Troubling Rain and Swoksaar, 

41
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,180
 will definitely earn their chance to shine. 

42
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:33,280
 Team Tiny Herb focuses on passing on techniques. 

43
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,940
 Their captain is the center of the team. Unity is their weapon. 

44
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:39,380
 A blade of grass can grow into a vast field. 

45
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:43,520
 Team Tyranny has an aggressive play style with ten years of ups and downs. 

46
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:51,140
 Cheering and worship are not important. 

47
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:55,980
 All I care about is fighting with you 

48
00:03:55,980 --> 00:04:00,320
 on this arena at this moment. 

49
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:03,140
 Today is irreplaceable. 

50
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:05,560
 There is only one goal. 

51
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:09,520
 Bring home the championship. 

52
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:14,820
   

53
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:18,601
Tonight, we welcome Round 7 of the Glory Pro League, Season 8.

54
00:04:18,601 --> 00:04:21,860
Team Tiny Herb will challenge the home team, Team Excellent Era.

55
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:22,780
   

56
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:27,060
Today, Pan Lin and I will bring you a live commentary of the match.

57
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:28,670
Viewers of tonight's battle

58
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:29,880
not only include audiences in front of the TV

59
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:32,140
but also audiences in front of their mobile phones.

60
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:36,960
- So many fans are here with us. Let me hear your shouts! 
  - Team Excellent Era must win! 

61
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:41,540
 Everyone has been looking forward to this match tonight for a long time. 

62
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:43,880
Team Excellent Era, as an experienced team in the League

63
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,720
that has won the championship three times.

64
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:48,440
They have the League's best combination: Battle God, Ye Qiu

65
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:50,640
and the top Launcher, Su Mucheng.

66
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,680
Ye Qiu is the first and the only

67
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:55,920
three-time winner in the history of Glory.

68
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:59,261
However, Team Tiny Herb's strength should not be underestimated either.

69
00:04:59,261 --> 00:05:00,960
As last Season's champion,

70
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,320
Captain Wang Jiexi, with his unpredictable way of playing,

71
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:05,600
has been called "the Magician".

72
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,999
Let's take a look at the two teams'

73
00:05:06,999 --> 00:05:08,301
lineup for this match. 
    

74
00:05:08,301 --> 00:05:09,760
First off is Excellent Era's lineup.

75
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,440
Battlemage: One Autumn Leaf.

76
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,920
Launcher: Dancing Rain.

77
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,320
Sharpshooter: Matchstick.

78
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,201
Cleric: Woven Shadow.

79
00:05:15,201 --> 00:05:16,700
Spellblade: Total Darkness.

80
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:17,961
Striker: Successive Strike.

81
00:05:17,961 --> 00:05:20,160
The Launcher and the Sharpshooter specialize in fighting long distances.

82
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,620
The Battlemage is in charge of the main attack.

83
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:23,220
While the Spellblade provides support.

84
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:25,180
Yes. While Team Tiny Herb has their captain, the Magician:

85
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:26,021
Vaccaria. 
    

86
00:05:26,021 --> 00:05:26,980
Knight: Angelica.

87
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:28,300
Sharpshooter: Red Leaves.

88
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:29,540
Cleric: Aweto.

89
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:30,601
Ghostblade: Rangoon Creeper.

90
00:05:30,601 --> 00:05:32,600
And Blade Master: Flying Sword, as their 6th player.

91
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:35,141
In the League, this team specializes in the Four-for-One strategy.

92
00:05:35,141 --> 00:05:37,880
The captain is the center of the team, Wang Jiexi, the Magician.

93
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:40,262
Their strength cannot be underestimated.

94
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,800
Excellent Era players have already started their preparations.

95
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,000
A huge battle is imminent.

96
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,900
On the screen, we can see Excellent Era's star player, Su Mucheng,

97
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:19,280
the top Launcher in the League, who is gentle and elegant.

98
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,200
She is the Goddess of Glory who plays fiercely.

99
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:23,760
Her excellent techniques surpass her beautiful look.

100
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:29,260
Let's warmly welcome Team Excellent Era's captain,

101
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:33,120
a three-consecutive winner, and the Creation Generation of the League.

102
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:38,380
He is the Textbook of Glory and Battle God, Ye Qiu.

103
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,400
 Battle God, Ye Qiu! 

104
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,400
 Battle God, Ye Qiu! 

105
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:48,080
 Battle God, Ye Qiu! 

106
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:52,440
What we can see now is Team Tiny Herb's Captain Wang Jiexi,

107
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:54,540
the unpredictable Magician.

108
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:56,240
The two teams have finished their preparation.

109
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,400
The match starts now.

110
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,780
In the Team Competition, each team has six members,

111
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:04,860
including five active players and one substitute.

112
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:07,380
The 6th player will be waiting in the substitution zone on the map.

113
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:09,860
When a teammate is eliminated or goes to the substitute zone,

114
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:12,260
the 6th player will take his place.

115
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:14,040
In the 15-minute match,

116
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:16,281
the team that eliminates more opponents wins and gets five points.

117
00:07:16,281 --> 00:07:17,460
If the number of players eliminated is the same,

118
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:19,620
the team with a larger total HP* will win. 
  (*Health Points) 

119
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:24,900
If a team wipes out the other team or breaks the League Records, they will gain two extra points.

120
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,760
Okay, both teams' players have entered the map.

121
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:31,960
The match officially begins.

122
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:34,880
Both teams head toward the center of the map at the same time.

123
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,180
Let's talk about these two teams.

124
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:49,300
Excellent Era has the Battle God, One Autumn Leaf.

125
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:53,600
His partner is Dancing Rain, played by Su Mucheng.

126
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:56,920
Team Tiny Herb's Vaccaria is played by Wang Jiexi.

127
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:59,900
Because of his elegant play style, he is also known as the Magician.

128
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:00,841
Arrowhead formation.

129
00:08:00,841 --> 00:08:02,520
Damage dealers cover the back.

130
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:04,240
Excellent Era has spread out and continues to move forward.

131
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,460
Launcher, slow down their frontline.

132
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,800
Excellent choice of position.

133
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,620
Dancing Rain used its recoil to reach the high point

134
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:16,300
and has started to attack.

135
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:22,220
The feint attack ends; all players start attacking.

136
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:26,721
One Autumn Leaf attacks the back row with Dragon Breaks the Ranks.

137
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:33,680
Ye Qiu, excellent techniques.

138
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,100
He helped teammates tear up Tiny Herb's formation.

139
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:37,320
This is not a good start for Tiny Herb.

140
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,920
Let's see it in slow motion.

141
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:48,420
The Sharpshooter is in the eleven o'clock position.

142
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:50,020
Spellblade, go around and attack their Cleric.

143
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:52,240
Be careful. Do not waste AOE*.
  (*Area of Effect, deals damage to multiple targets) 

144
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:56,500
Tiny Herb is currently in a passive position.

145
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:57,670
Vaccaria is looking for opportunities

146
00:08:57,670 --> 00:09:00,100
to help his teammates escape danger.

147
00:09:00,101 --> 00:09:01,340
Good containment, Su Mucheng.

148
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:02,980
She takes advantage of the Launcher's shooting range

149
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:06,080
to interfere with Vaccaria, keeping him from getting away.

150
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:11,520
Not bad. Look out for the rear. Keep an eye on the opponents.

151
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:14,060
Ye Qiu indeed lives up to his name as the Master Tactician.

152
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:15,181
The situation may look chaotic.

153
00:09:15,181 --> 00:09:17,580
But Excellent Era has been consuming Tiny Herb's HP.

154
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:19,840
Cleric, shield Spellblade.

155
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,860
Solo flank from behind. Don't get killed.

156
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:22,900
Yes, such a chaotic scene.

157
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:25,061
But Excellent Era's one-on-one tactics are working.

158
00:09:25,061 --> 00:09:27,180
Tiny Herb is restrained.

159
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:29,300
Tiny Herb needs to adjust their formation as soon as possible.

160
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:31,100
It's Wang Jiexi!

161
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:37,160
His Magic Missile perfectly interrupted Excellent Era's Matchstick

162
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:39,060
and saved his Cleric.

163
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:46,201
Amazing prediction!

164
00:09:46,201 --> 00:09:48,120
Vaccaria predicted Dancing Rain's movements.

165
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,100
Skill hit.

166
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:56,680
At present, Team Excellent Era is in the lead with more HP.

167
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,760
The HP of Tiny Herb's Cleric dropped rapidly.

168
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:01,060
Yes. Excellent Era just needs to continue its attacks.

169
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:03,700
I believe they will win.

170
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:10,520
Although Excellent Era lost some HP,

171
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:12,861
compared with Tiny Herb, they're still leading in total HP

172
00:10:12,861 --> 00:10:16,120
with their Spellblade, Total Darkness having full HP.

173
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:20,020
- At this time, Team Tiny Herb's Captain Wang Jiexi's decision will be critical. 
  - Go! 

174
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:23,460
Prepare to retreat. Tactical formation.

175
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:26,420
We see Tiny Herb is retreating.

176
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:36,100
Looks like Tiny Herb's Cleric is falling behind.

177
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:37,620
This is an opportunity for Excellent Era.

178
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:41,020
If they can eliminate Tiny Herb's Cleric, Excellent Era will win this round.

179
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:42,600
Wow, what an epic match.

180
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:46,720
Whoever eliminates an opponent first will be the brightest star tonight.

181
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:53,760
This is not normal.

182
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:56,620
Distance yourselves. Kite* them first. 
  (*Long distance attack and avoid taking damage) 

183
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:00,220
Return to your position!

184
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:01,600
Total Darkness is too impatient.

185
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,120
- He is now completely separated from the team. 
 - Get ready.

186
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,660
Is this Excellent Era's tactic?

187
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,000
He's attacking!

188
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,940
Close in around him.

189
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:17,780
Looks like that was not a tactical arrangement.

190
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:20,481
Total Darkness's mistake destroyed the advantage Excellent Era had.

191
00:11:20,481 --> 00:11:21,960
He is too reckless.

192
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:24,620
If Excellent Era loses because of this, his recklessness is to blame.

193
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:25,920
Total Darkness was too reckless.

194
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,600
He gave Tiny Herb a chance to eliminate himself.

195
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,960
Excellent Era's total HP has now fallen behind.

196
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,360
Yes, Tiny Herb changed the situation instantly.

197
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,020
Excellent Era is now fighting four against five.

198
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:36,200
Although the 6th player entered the competition,

199
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,660
he is still far away from the battlefield.

200
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:41,100
Excellent Era is in danger. Does Ye Qiu want to change tactics?

201
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:46,040
Reorganize the formation.

202
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:48,240
Ranged attack on their frontline. Be careful, don't get killed.

203
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,100
How will Excellent Era deal with 4v5 now?

204
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:53,180
It seems that the victory of this match will slip through Excellent Era's fingers.

205
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:55,420
Spitfire, use Hellfire for AOE.

206
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:57,341
Launcher, ranged AOE.

207
00:11:57,341 --> 00:11:59,481
Pay attention to the two support wings. Carry out Tactic Three.

208
00:11:59,481 --> 00:12:00,740
Sweeping Tactic.

209
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:01,960
One Autumn Leaf and Dancing Rain

210
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,900
is carrying out Glory's most classic teamwork.

211
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:05,860
Under the Launcher's cover, the Battlemage moves forward.

212
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:07,360
It seems that Ye Qiu has not changed his plan.

213
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,960
He won't let Tiny Herb have the chance to recover.

214
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,960
Let him in. Beheading Tactic.

215
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:20,460
Tiny Herb no longer intercepts One Autumn Leaf and seems to let him in.

216
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:24,020
Does Tiny Herb want to attack like last time to eliminate One Autumn Leaf?

217
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:26,780
Red Leaves with low HP wants to fight back.

218
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:32,560
Nice! Red Leaves is eliminated.

219
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,740
Red Leaves does not possess high HP.

220
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:36,040
She wanted to sneak attack One Autumn Leaf

221
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:38,560
but she was interrupted by Dancing Rain.

222
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,360
At present, there are four players in each team.

223
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,480
Tiny Herb's 6th player also enters the match.

224
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:51,680
Excellent Era eliminated a player, but their total HP is still behind.

225
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:52,840
They remain disadvantaged.

226
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:53,840
If Tiny Herb drags it out

227
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,720
while maintaining the same number of players on both teams,

228
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:58,320
Tiny Herb can still win.

229
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,760
Let's start.

230
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,320
One Autumn Leaf is fiercely attacking Tiny Herb.

231
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:05,360
Trying to eliminate another opponent.

232
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:08,441
Tiny Herb is using Angelica, the Knight, to stall One Autumn Leaf.

233
00:13:08,441 --> 00:13:09,940
Knights have strong defense and high HP.

234
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:11,200
There are only 30 seconds left.

235
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,221
It's hard for One Autumn Leaf to eliminate him in such a short time.

236
00:13:13,221 --> 00:13:16,060
Can Ye Qiu use his superior skill to create a miracle?

237
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:17,320
In such a short period of time,

238
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:21,240
it seems impossible to eliminate the Knight with such strong defense.

239
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,181
One Autumn Leaf is going all out

240
00:13:27,181 --> 00:13:29,560
while Angelica is trying his best to defend.

241
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:31,981
Excellent Era's other players are also providing cover for their captain.

242
00:13:31,981 --> 00:13:35,100
Ye Qiu has a burst in APM*. The match is heating up. 
  (*Actions per minute, hand speed) 

243
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:53,500
Fire cover.

244
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:57,920
Armor Piercing Cannon.

245
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,881
At this critical moment, Dancing Rain helps One Autumn Leaf.

246
00:13:59,881 --> 00:14:01,600
There's five seconds left!

247
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,520
One Autumn Leaf is doing his best to deal damage.

248
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:06,480
His use of skills is getting faster.

249
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:09,400
- Rising Dragon Soars the Sky. 
 - 2 seconds remaining.

250
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:11,020
Draconic Crusher.

251
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,240
Ye Qiu. He did it!

252
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,040
The HP of Tiny Herb's Knight fell to zero.

253
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:18,580
He won in the very last second.

254
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:20,160
What a great match.

255
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,780
In the last second, Ye Qiu eliminated the opponent.

256
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:26,060
The Battle God ends this match in his own way.

257
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:28,400
Dancing Rain's critical assistance also proves to us

258
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:31,500
they indeed have the best teamwork in the League.

259
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,380
Tonight, we witnessed history together.

260
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:35,340
Excellent Era hasn't fallen yet.

261
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:36,880
Compared with the loses recently, 
    

262
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:40,200
Excellent Era and Captain Ye Qiu, with his stunning skills, used this victory

263
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:43,360
to prove to everyone that Excellent Era, the King, has returned.

264
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:46,960
The Battle God once again created miracles in the critical moment.

265
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,360
Let's shout out together.

266
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:53,440
- The greatest name in the history of Glory, Ye Qiu. 
  - Ye Qiu! 

267
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:06,360
Yours are much warmer.

268
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:14,000
This is Captain Ye Qiu, who created a miracle tonight.

269
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,900
Black mask, black hat,

270
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:18,560
and sharp eyes are his trademarks.

271
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,800
He never appears in front of the public.

272
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,220
 He doesn't participate in any sponsored matches 

273
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:23,840
 or any publicity campaigns. 

274
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:26,360
 We have enjoyed a legendary match, 

275
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:29,680
 but we will never see Glory's Grandmaster, Ye Qiu. 

276
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:32,740
 Maybe he only shows who he really is 

277
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:35,840
 in front of the person he cherishes the most. 

278
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:46,580
 Glory is never a single-player competition. 

279
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:48,620
 It is a team competition. 

280
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:51,480
 Compared with extravagant techniques 

281
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:53,980
 or increased number of strikes, 

282
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:56,020
 teamwork matters more. 

283
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:02,200
 In times of crisis, players need to calmly show all their skills without being flashy. 

284
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:05,160
 There is no weak team in the League. 

285
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,360
 No one can just rely on luck. 

286
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:31,400
This is the second time Tiny Herb counterattacked.

287
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:35,020
In this round of attack and defense, there was a serious mistake.

288
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:38,660
The rhythm of the whole match became chaotic from that moment.

289
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:56,921
This was already a tactic with obvious flaws.

290
00:16:56,921 --> 00:16:58,520
Look here.

291
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:00,200
When Tiny Herb retreated,

292
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:02,880
their Cleric was far away from his team.

293
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:05,720
In this distance, there were 40 position units.

294
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:08,540
However, the time to retreat was only six seconds.

295
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:10,520
Even if the Cleric was slow,

296
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:13,780
he distanced himself from the team in such a short time.

297
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:15,380
What does it mean?

298
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:19,320
The Cleric already started getting into position.

299
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:20,780
That's right.

300
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:23,240
This was a deliberately dropped bait.

301
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:25,240
However, we still took it.

302
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:27,520
And firmly at that.

303
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:28,840
During the last 40 seconds,

304
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:32,300
we could have delayed on purpose to win the match.

305
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:37,040
However, you chose to attack alone.

306
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:39,081
- I... 
 - After being separated from the team,

307
00:17:39,081 --> 00:17:42,360
you used Electric Wave Formation in two seconds.

308
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:43,600
In order to kill the bait,

309
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:47,900
you wasted a strong skill and your own life.

310
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:02,261
This is not the first time something like this happened.

311
00:18:02,261 --> 00:18:04,420
Give me a reasonable explanation.

312
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,160
I wanted...

313
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:09,720
I wanted to take the first kill for our team.

314
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:17,420
Not for us,

315
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:19,920
but for yourself.

316
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:24,480
 Whoever eliminates the opponent first will be the brightest star tonight. 

317
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:32,460
You only use the right skill at the right time.

318
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:34,600
Turn advantage into victory.

319
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:38,780
This is the most basic for professional eSports players.

320
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:42,180
If every player turns the Team Competition into a solo show,

321
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:46,620
this team will not last.

322
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,520
I'm done.

323
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:56,380
Chen Yehui, you are not suitable for the Team.

324
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:58,260
Go back to the guild.

325
00:18:58,260 --> 00:19:02,520
Captain, I don't understand what you mean.

326
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,460
The team doesn't need you anymore.

327
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:25,280
   

328
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:43,260
Three championship trophies.

329
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:46,520
Three Regular Season MVP Trophies.

330
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:50,340
This wall is the League's true Wall of Fame.

331
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:53,620
Now the League's pushing for more matches.

332
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:56,980
If we continue that old strategy, we will soon be eliminated.

333
00:19:56,980 --> 00:19:59,940
In the next match, I want to try some new tactics.

334
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:03,260
In a competition, there will always be winners and losers.

335
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:05,320
Don't work yourself too hard.

336
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,320
I don't like losing.

337
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:14,280
If you lose today, you can win it back tomorrow.

338
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:18,040
Victory and defeat are simply a matter of probability.

339
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,840
However, business is different.

340
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,880
We are all gambling here.

341
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:27,100
If you don't watch your step, you will fall into a bottomless pit.

342
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:30,960
If you make any mistake, you're all out.

343
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:38,860
You mentioned using new tactics just now?

344
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:41,180
Mucheng and I brought the Sweeping Tactic to the League.

345
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:43,881
But this tactic is no longer a secret.

346
00:20:43,881 --> 00:20:46,680
It's been targeted and studied. It's normal.

347
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:49,720
Have you ever thought maybe it's not a problem of tactics,

348
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:52,600
but in its players?

349
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:57,740
What do you think of the newcomers from the last season?

350
00:20:57,740 --> 00:20:59,740
What do you think of Sun Xiang?

351
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:00,740
He is good.

352
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:02,260
I have paid attention to him before.

353
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:04,060
He ranked first in KDA* among the newcomers. 
  (*Kills, Deaths, Assists) 

354
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:05,960
The efficiency is quite high.

355
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:07,740
It's just...

356
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:08,800
No.

357
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,680
I mean...

358
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:14,580
how is he compared to your old days?

359
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:21,580
I can't tell unless I fight against him.

360
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:28,960
All you masters care about is fighting against each other.

361
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,280
Ye Qiu.

362
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:34,680
Sometimes, you can build rapport with someone after meeting them once.

363
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:52,800
Let me introduce you.

364
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:55,260
This is Conquering Cloud's...

365
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:57,800
He is Excellent Era's Sun Xiang.

366
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:00,160
I'm Ye Qiu.

367
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:03,600
I didn't expect to see Brother Ye's real face.

368
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:07,160
What an honor.

369
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:15,000
Excellent Era's profit used to account for half of the League's profit.

370
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,840
However, now we are way behind other teams.

371
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:21,260
Now the whole League is changing.

372
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:24,800
We need to follow the trend. Now,

373
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:29,460
what we need the most now are players like Sun Xiang.

374
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:30,660
He is good at playing matches.

375
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:33,561
He can also bring some fresh blood to create commercial value for the League.

376
00:22:33,561 --> 00:22:38,020
Don't worry. When I join you, we will only get better.

377
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:41,500
What do you mean by "we"?

378
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:49,120
Let me introduce again.

379
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:50,980
He is Excellent Era's...

380
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:56,280
new captain, Sun Xiang.

381
00:22:56,280 --> 00:23:00,120
From now on, Sun Xiang will take your position as captain. 
    

382
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:03,820
The One Autumn Leaf account is his now.

383
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:09,000
Of course. If you are willing to stay to be his sparring partner,

384
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:13,600
I'll think of some way to help you get some compensation.

385
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,240
No need.

386
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:18,240
Terminate my contract.

387
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,240
Are you sure?

388
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:29,120
If you terminate the contract, you can't get a dime.

389
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:41,080
I chose to retire.

390
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:56,120
Do you like eSports?

391
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:57,500
What?

392
00:23:57,500 --> 00:24:01,640
If you like it, consider all of this as a glory,

393
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:05,300
rather than a chance to show off.

394
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:32,140
Are you truly letting him retire?

395
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:35,620
 The rules of Glory have long changed. 

396
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:38,780
 It's not like when the League first formed, 

397
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:41,220
 winning trophies does not mean you will get your investment. 

398
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:44,520
 I've already arranged all of the commercial events. 

399
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:47,580
 Will Ye Qiu come? 

400
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:51,640
 He can't make money for us and refuses to be obedient. 

401
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:58,120
 No matter how many MVPs he gets, he is meaningless to me. 

402
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:04,380
Retired players cannot participate in League matches for a year.

403
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:06,360
As a professional eSports player,

404
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:08,340
one month away from any matches will end his career,

405
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:10,580
let alone a whole year.

406
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:16,180
One Autumn Leaf's account card is yours now.

407
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:20,260
Mind your own position.

408
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:57,820
Excuse me.

409
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:05,340
In such a big place, people don't even make room for the captain anymore.

410
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:08,180
It seems that you are really going down.

411
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:12,360
Only those in higher places can go down.

412
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:16,880
If someone is always at the bottom, he is nothing but desperate.

413
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:22,780
You have become even harsher these days.

414
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:26,160
I remember what you said before.

415
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:29,120
You said Excellent Era would never need someone like me.

416
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,930
How about now?

417
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:35,960
Excellent Era doesn't need you, not me.

418
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:41,260
Have you finished? I'm in a hurry.

419
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:45,960
Since my first day in Excellent Era, you have always looked down on me.

420
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:48,640
You were so mighty back then.

421
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:51,280
You don't play sponsored matches, no endorsements.

422
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:53,120
You had everyone waiting for you.

423
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:55,240
Who do you think you are?

424
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:57,760
How about now?

425
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:04,280
Those who can stay are the people who obey the rules.

426
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:11,980
Are you done now?

427
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:25,440
Ye Qiu, you are no longer a member of Team Excellent Era.

428
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,680
Why are you still wearing our team uniform?

429
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:31,960
Take it off. Or I can help you take it off.

430
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:10,640
   

431
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:34,240
 Battle God Ye Qiu! 
   

432
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:56,180
It's an away game. You came to buy things yourself?

433
00:29:56,180 --> 00:29:58,820
However, you are still one step behind.

434
00:29:58,820 --> 00:30:04,040
I have already prepared what you need in advance, like always.

435
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:13,340
Take another one of these.

436
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:24,060
What's wrong with you?

437
00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:36,480
Can I pay the bill please?

438
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:48,440
What's the matter?

439
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:52,180
I won't go in.

440
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:55,340
Why? What happened?

441
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:00,900
My contract was terminated.

442
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,450
I chose to retire.

443
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:07,800
I will leave with you.

444
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:21,080
Stay here and fight hard.

445
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:24,880
For our sake.

446
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:31,160
For the ten years we spent together.

447
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:14,620
I know.

448
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:17,220
The fact that the captain is retired

449
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:21,460
may be hard for you senior members to accept at the moment.

450
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:23,860
There is pressure from above and dissatisfaction from below.

451
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:25,920
I can't just sit back and do nothing.

452
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:30,300
Don't worry. This retirement is just a show.

453
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:33,480
As long as you stay in Excellent Era, I will definitely—

454
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:35,340
I won't leave.

455
00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:38,380
You are still...

456
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:43,060
my boss.

457
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:53,080
Honestly, I was also very upset Ye Qiu chose to leave.

458
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:54,280
After all, we have—

459
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:56,000
After all,

460
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:02,720
we have gone through...

461
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:06,220
those difficult days together.

462
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,230
Regardless of how you forced Ye Qiu to leave,

463
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:16,600
he's more resolute than you think.

464
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:20,940
Because to him, Glory is his faith.

465
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:24,660
When a once-shattered faith is rebuilt,

466
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:28,220
it will only become more stunning and more tenacious,

467
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:34,300
even if it takes some detours and brings loneliness.

468
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:36,900
He will return to his starting point.

469
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:40,480
He will definitely return to the League

470
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:44,140
and reclaim his glory.

471
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:49,600
 Mucheng. 

472
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:51,220
 A year. 

473
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:53,750
 I'll rest for a year. 

474
00:33:54,571 --> 00:33:56,260
 And then I'll return. 

475
00:33:56,260 --> 00:33:58,129
   

476
00:34:09,171 --> 00:34:12,660
   

477
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:13,960
Thank you.

478
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:15,510
- Turn on a computer, please. 
 - All right, coming.

479
00:34:15,510 --> 00:34:18,660
Glory has opened a new server on their anniversary every year. 
    

480
00:34:18,660 --> 00:34:20,140
Thank you.

481
00:34:20,140 --> 00:34:22,840
This is a time for all players to start from the beginning.

482
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:24,540
Yes, let's start over together.

483
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:27,270
Let's open an account first. A new journey has begun.

484
00:34:27,270 --> 00:34:28,600
Let's have fun in the new server.

485
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:30,480
- Sister Chu, we'll take our usual four computers. 
 - Yes, I know.

486
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:32,640
- You go up first. 
 - Give me your ID cards later.

487
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:34,980
- Got it. 
 - Hurry and open an account.

488
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:37,460
Quick. How is it now? Go and create an account.

489
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:39,760
Quick. Go!

490
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:41,900
Open an account first. It's about to begin.

491
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:43,720
Boss, turn on a computer for me, please.

492
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:46,501
- Quickly. 
  - No. 47, Area C. 

493
00:35:01,690 --> 00:35:04,400
 Quickly! 

494
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,412
 Get ready, it's starting soon. 

495
00:35:06,412 --> 00:35:08,240
 Ten. Nine. 
   

496
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:10,120
 Eight. Seven. 

497
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:12,960
 Six. Five. Four. 

498
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:14,880
 Three. Two. 
   

499
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:17,604

00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:21,600
   

501
00:35:22,812 --> 00:35:24,796
   

502
00:35:24,796 --> 00:35:26,000
   

503
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,321
 All equipment needs items to upgrade. 
   

504
00:35:28,321 --> 00:35:30,781
 The number of people in a guild is limited. Come and join us. 

505
00:35:30,781 --> 00:35:33,261
 All the dungeon records and leaderboards are empty. 

506
00:35:33,261 --> 00:35:34,901
 How exciting. Here we come! 

507
00:35:34,901 --> 00:35:37,641
 - Hurry and do your tasks, Everyone! 
 - Right, complete tasks. 

508
00:35:37,641 --> 00:35:39,540
 You can choose your profession once you own a weapon. 

509
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:40,780
 What are "professions"? 

510
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:42,040
 Glory has 24 professions. 

511
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:43,400
 It is divided into six main classes. 

512
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:46,260
 Fighter, Mage, Night Walker, Priest, Swordsman, and Gunner. 

513
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:49,100
 Each profession has its own advantages and disadvantages. 

514
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:52,000
 Should I choose my profession according to my constellation or my characteristic? 

515
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,900
 Constellation. 

516
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:57,760
 It's okay. Don't be nervous 

517
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:02,000
 Don't worry, I'll carry you*.

 I call this equipment Myriad Manifestation Umbrella. 

524
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:17,320
 It can adjust itself into all of Glory's 24 professions 

525

 with 120 low-level skills level 20 and under

 This team strategy is built around the Battlemage. 

541
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:11,700
 I want to try a different profession, though. 

542
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:13,100
 I thought it was something serious. 

543
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:16,100
 It is important to choose the right profession. 

544
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:17,500
 Profession? 

545
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:21,000
 In the world of Glory, you want to be restrained to a profession? 

546

 You should be the King's Avatar* instead.

 I have a friend 

550
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:38,000
 who plays Glory like a master. 

551
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:41,820
 Then, he left. 

552
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:45,080
 There is one thing he told me. 

553
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:48,400
 "It's just a matter of starting all over again."

563
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:56,000
Boss, can I pay the bill, please?

564
00:39:57,720 --> 00:39:59,000
You need to pay the bill, right? Just a second.

565
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,800
After I finish this match.

566
00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:02,820
Use Knee Strike.

567

- Don't use Swing. 
 - Shut up.

568
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:10,201
It's just a PK battle. Do you need to be this serious?

569
00:40:10,201 --> 00:40:11,980
Of course I do.

570
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:15,060
Glory is more than just a battle.

571
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:19,460
Lost again.

572
00:40:21,541 --> 00:40:23,400
- Can I pay the bill now? 
 - Sure.

573
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:25,580
- Boss, come here. 
 - Coming!

574
00:40:25,580 --> 00:40:27,620
Wait a second.

575
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:32,520
- Why is the screen black again? 
 - What's the matter?

576
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:35,820
Am I playing Glory, or is the computer playing me?

577
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:55,500
Boss.

578
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:57,800
Is that man playing with your account?

579
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:00,140
Will he steal your equipment? 
    

580
00:41:00,140 --> 00:41:01,920
Oh, no.

581
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:07,040
You brat, are you looking for trouble?

582
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:16,540
You won?

583
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:19,160
I saw the PK* started, 
  (*Player Kill, a term for challenging others) 

584
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:20,860
so I played a round for you.

585
00:41:20,860 --> 00:41:23,100
How long did it take for you to win?

586
00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:24,960
Forty seconds.

587
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:29,240
This is awesome.

588
00:41:30,141 --> 00:41:32,280
 Come on. We are short of Tanks. 

589

 Who is good at playing Tanks? Come here immediately. 

590
00:41:35,340 --> 00:41:38,040
 - Not bad, Buddy. 
 - I won! 

591
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:39,560
 Well done! 

592
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:41,821
 - Yeah, well done.  
 - Boss.

593
00:41:41,821 --> 00:41:45,820
You said Glory was more than just a battle.

594
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:51,400
Then... what is Glory?

595
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:53,500
Glory...

596
00:41:57,020 --> 00:41:59,680
It was Glory who brought us all together.

597
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:04,560
Glory is a world that belongs to all of us.

598
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:14,680
You're paying the bill, right? Sorry about that.
