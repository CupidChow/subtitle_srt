No.

Brother Yi Fan, your Ghost Boundary is insane!

 You should improve all the skills of the Ghost Boundary. 

70
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:46,050
 You need to remember everything and practice. 

71

 Your reaction and judgment are not good enough. 

72
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,905
 More combat experience will help. 

73
00:04:48,905 --> 00:04:50,455
 Your state of mind is not professional enough.

 Your emotions can control you. 

75

Actually, in Green Forest, when we first randomly teamed up,

I had an agenda.

164

00:11:29,810 --> 00:11:31,730
Then I could take all the inventory.

167
00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:36,005
But later, my plan fell apart.

168
00:11:36,005 --> 00:11:39,505
So I broadcast in the "world," and framed you in the "world."

169
00:11:39,505 --> 00:11:41,580
Now I feel I was so childish.

170
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:44,505
Later, I led you into the Spider Cave.

171
00:11:44,505 --> 00:11:48,010
That was just to trap you.

172
00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:51,130
But I overestimated myself.

173
00:11:51,130 --> 00:11:55,370
You could easily defeat a number of us all by yourself.

174
00:11:55,370 --> 00:11:59,910
At last, it was you who led us to defeat the hidden boss.

175
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:03,430
And you gave me the last sword.

176
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:07,880
 Why are you confessing? I don't get it. 

177
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:11,570
So I want to apologize to you.

178
00:12:11,570 --> 00:12:14,905
Forgive me, please.

179
00:12:14,905 --> 00:12:17,070
 If you have something to say, just speak up. 

180
00:12:18,105 --> 00:12:20,605
Actually, I want to ask you a favor.

181
00:12:20,605 --> 00:12:22,455
Could you create a dungeon for our Full Moon Guild?

182
00:12:22,455 --> 00:12:25,680
Just like what you did for the Blue Brook Guild and the Tyrannical Ambitions Guild.

183
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:29,380
Just create one dungeon for us. Then get onto the ranking list to play.

184
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:31,330
 You haven't even finished with the situation in Spider Cave? 

185
00:12:31,330 --> 00:12:32,730
 What sort of tricks are you planning this time? 

186
00:12:32,730 --> 00:12:34,805
It's not what you're thinking.

187
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:41,530
Master, I'll be honest with you.

188
00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:44,810
My guild will collapse soon.

189
00:12:44,810 --> 00:12:48,305
I... I know you make money from dungeons.

190
00:12:48,305 --> 00:12:49,650
I know how much it will cost.

191
00:12:49,650 --> 00:12:52,505
My guild can't afford it even if we use all we have.

192
00:12:52,505 --> 00:12:53,530
But don't worry.

193
00:12:53,530 --> 00:12:57,770
Later, we'll pay you back with everything we acquire each day, until we pay you back.

194
00:12:57,770 --> 00:12:59,380
Is that okay?

195
00:13:00,830 --> 00:13:02,605
Please.

196
00:13:06,505 --> 00:13:08,230
It's really shabby.

197
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:12,055
All this inventory together is not as valuable as what you have in your hand.

198
00:13:23,855 --> 00:13:25,680
I didn't look at it clearly earlier.

199
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,810
You've got the Lance of the Purple Moon?

200
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:30,480
I'll take that.

201
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:33,970
You'll... only take one lance?

202
00:13:42,805 --> 00:13:44,155
Reading about the strategy?

203
00:13:44,155 --> 00:13:46,256
Xiao Tang has been busy with the strategy, working very hard.

204
00:13:46,256 --> 00:13:49,030
What's so odd about that?

205
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:50,560
You're reading a dungeon strategy guide?

206
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,470
   

207
00:13:53,755 --> 00:13:55,270
We're about to attack the Desolate Lands Dungeon.

208
00:13:55,270 --> 00:13:57,330
Sharpening the spear just before a battle?

209
00:13:57,330 --> 00:13:58,505
I'm just reading.

210
00:13:58,505 --> 00:14:00,980
Just reading.

211
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:02,905
The living Glory master will be the captain.

212
00:14:02,905 --> 00:14:05,930
You just need to know about other strategies.

213
00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:10,305
The living Glory master is my idol, Ye Qiu.

214
00:14:10,305 --> 00:14:13,380
Don't take the credit for yourself.

215
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:20,980
Xiao Tang, who wrote this strategy?

216
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:24,430
The writer is Concealed Light. Why?

217
00:14:27,355 --> 00:14:29,680
It's very detailed.

218
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:32,270
It includes all the probable events.

219
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:34,855
It even calculates the time for each step.

220
00:14:34,855 --> 00:14:37,480
- Down to a millisecond. 
 - Let me have a look.

221
00:14:41,530 --> 00:14:45,205
Xiao Tang, look at this guy. Very strange.

222
00:14:45,205 --> 00:14:48,480
He wrote so much for a low-grade dungeon.

223
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,930
Who would have the patience to read through it?

224
00:14:50,930 --> 00:14:54,130
Reading it is hard for a loser.

225
00:14:55,905 --> 00:14:58,780
Who is a loser? Xiao Tang, he is bullying me.

226
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:00,430
Who's he talking about?

227
00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:04,870
Boss, keep it up.

228
00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:11,530
 Boss, when will you deliver my paper and pen? 

229
00:15:11,530 --> 00:15:13,305
Him again!

230
00:15:13,305 --> 00:15:14,356
In all my business years,

231
00:15:14,356 --> 00:15:17,580
I have never seen anyone who always asks for paper and a pen.

232
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:20,605
Xiao Tang, is he making this place his study room?

233
00:15:20,605 --> 00:15:22,650
The same as you.

234
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:26,305
Don't you have anything to do?

235
00:15:29,005 --> 00:15:31,250
Go and deliver it to him!

236
00:15:34,690 --> 00:15:38,280
Xiao Tang, send me a copy of that strategy, please.

237
00:15:51,330 --> 00:15:53,390
Xiao Tang...

238
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:56,080
It's great that you work in the internet café.

239
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:59,755
It's my honor that you can tutor me.

240
00:16:04,005 --> 00:16:07,605
Xiao Tang, could you help me with this?

241
00:16:07,605 --> 00:16:10,105
I can't figure it out. Could you help me?

242
00:16:10,105 --> 00:16:11,780
Please?

243
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,055
Xiao Tang.

244
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,755
I should go and try it.

245
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:22,030
Xiao Tang... What about this?

246
00:16:22,030 --> 00:16:23,905
Just leave blank what you can't do and continue doing your homework.

247
00:16:23,905 --> 00:16:26,180
This is called a test "strategy."

248
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:28,505
Xiao Tang...

249
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:34,980
I can't do any of it by myself.

250
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:04,800
 This pen is running out of ink. Why hasn't it been delivered yet? 

251
00:17:08,130 --> 00:17:16,130
   

252
00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:20,630
From the storage rack on the first floor to my door,

253
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:23,255
it only takes five minutes using the average human speed.

254
00:17:23,255 --> 00:17:27,550
But it took you... six minutes and twelve seconds.

255
00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:32,455
Your paper.

256
00:17:33,730 --> 00:17:35,530
The paper weight is not right.

257
00:17:35,530 --> 00:17:37,670
The brand I want weighs 4.09 grams.

258
00:17:37,670 --> 00:17:39,090
But this one weighs 4.06 grams.

259
00:17:39,090 --> 00:17:43,205
The friction that my pen generates will slow down my calculations.

260
00:17:51,530 --> 00:17:53,830
- My pen? 
 - What?

261
00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:55,405
My pen...

262
00:18:00,255 --> 00:18:03,305
Sorry. Your pen.

263
00:18:03,305 --> 00:18:05,605
Wait a minute.

264
00:18:05,605 --> 00:18:06,690
You brought the wrong one.

265
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:09,290
What I ordered was cartridge 0.48, not 0.45.

266
00:18:09,290 --> 00:18:11,230
So you were late by 72 seconds,

267
00:18:11,230 --> 00:18:12,650
and it took me 48 seconds to explain to you.

268
00:18:12,650 --> 00:18:15,130
You wasted two minutes.

269
00:18:15,130 --> 00:18:18,455
I could have done more calculations in these two minutes...

270
00:18:18,455 --> 00:18:19,930
Take your time.

271
00:18:19,930 --> 00:18:21,790
I won't stop you from your numerous activities.

272
00:18:21,790 --> 00:18:24,330
Numerous activities? That's what webmasters do.

273
00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:26,000
You hurry up. I need it in a short time.

274
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,480
Okay, okay. There's still time to look for a pro.

275
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:31,805
What pro? I'm going to a meeting.

276
00:18:31,805 --> 00:18:33,205
Why are you having a meeting?

277
00:18:33,205 --> 00:18:36,180
To find the pro who has turned the world upside down

278
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:39,580
and left everything in a mess.

279
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:42,750
Xi Zhou, you can't say that.

280
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:45,180
This pro really has helped our Blue Brook Guild a lot.

281
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:49,130
Think about it. He did his best to help us research Boneyard.

282
00:18:49,130 --> 00:18:51,130
Aren't you overthinking this?

283
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:52,930
He took the inventory.

284
00:18:52,930 --> 00:18:54,880
We were even.

285
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:57,155
It's just a scheme, okay?

286
00:19:00,005 --> 00:19:02,430
Okay, I see. I'm going to the meeting. Talk to you later.

287
00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:05,005
Talk about what? Everything is clear.

288
00:19:05,005 --> 00:19:08,630
You just can't live without a pro.

289
00:19:16,905 --> 00:19:18,780
 Now the world is in a mess. 

290
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:20,280
 Everything is bloody. 

291
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:22,955
 All the guilds suffered a great loss. 

292
00:19:22,955 --> 00:19:25,080
 It's time to call a truce. 

293
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,430
 Let's talk about peace. 

294
00:19:26,430 --> 00:19:28,050
 Now you want to talk about peace? 

295
00:19:28,050 --> 00:19:30,530
 It was you, Herb Garden Guild, who started the fight. 

296
00:19:30,530 --> 00:19:33,755
 It was Blue Brook Guild who first asked Lord Grim to substitute. 

297
00:19:33,755 --> 00:19:35,230
Who was the substitute?

298
00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:37,670
He was an official member of Blue Brook Guild.

299
00:19:37,670 --> 00:19:41,930
He was making the dungeon record as one of us.

300
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:44,055
It's just that he left our guild later.

301
00:19:44,055 --> 00:19:45,705
 - I... 
 - Nonsense! 

302
00:19:45,705 --> 00:19:48,610
 He was one of you whenever he was substituting. 

303
00:19:48,610 --> 00:19:51,705
 Old Ye, don't talk trash. 

304
00:19:51,705 --> 00:19:55,205
 Blue River, your Blue Brook Guild killed my elite brigade. 

305
00:19:55,205 --> 00:19:57,655
 - What would you do?  
 - Stop arguing!

306
00:19:57,655 --> 00:20:00,210
Could we just stop killing each other?

307
00:20:00,210 --> 00:20:03,090
Can't we play it fairly?

308
00:20:03,090 --> 00:20:04,590
Without fighting with each other?

309
00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:07,350
You are such a pacifist.

310
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:10,190
 Congratulations to Players Lord Grim, Soft Mist, 

311
00:20:10,190 --> 00:20:12,210
 Steam Bun Invasion, One Inch Ash, and Sleeping Moon, 

312
00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:14,210
 belonging to the Full Moon Guild. 
   

313
00:20:14,210 --> 00:20:16,310
 They have created a new record for the Desolated Lands Dungeon. 

314
00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:17,970
 Time used was 22.35 seconds. 

315
00:20:17,970 --> 00:20:20,210
 This... Full Moon guild; who's that? 

316
00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:22,870
 Hey, you guys, have any of you heard of this guild? 

317
00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:25,450
 How can this kind of shady guild try to steal our thunder? 

318
00:20:25,450 --> 00:20:28,430
 Desolated Lands? Oh, my! 

319
00:20:28,430 --> 00:20:30,870
 They even broke the record set by our guild. 

320
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:34,650
Lord Grim. You certainly are not picky.

321
00:20:40,390 --> 00:20:41,950
Xi Zhou, how can he do that?

322
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:43,810
The only thing he wants is the inventory.

323
00:20:43,810 --> 00:20:45,370
As long as he gets what he wants, he will help anyone.

324
00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:48,010
I thought he was one of us.

325
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:49,810
Why did you think of him as one of us?

326
00:20:49,810 --> 00:20:52,290
You only care about yourself.

327
00:20:57,070 --> 00:20:59,730
This Lord Grim is shameless, as blind as a bat, and

328
00:20:59,730 --> 00:21:01,210
disregards moral principles in pursuit of profits.

329
00:21:01,210 --> 00:21:02,610
He pretends to be kind and righteous.

330
00:21:02,610 --> 00:21:04,490
He fails in every criterion. He is a disaster to all living creatures.

331
00:21:04,490 --> 00:21:07,850
Everyone who plays Glory should despise him.

332
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:11,770
From now on, Lord Grim, you are officially

333
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:13,410
the arch-enemy of Blue Brook Guild.

334
00:21:13,410 --> 00:21:17,110
That's right! From now on, he is our arch-enemy.

335
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:18,950
Think about it, everyone.

336
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:20,370
Before the opening of the 10th Server,

337
00:21:20,370 --> 00:21:23,210
has this kind of thing ever happened?

338
00:21:23,210 --> 00:21:25,190
Ever since Lord Grim appeared,

339
00:21:25,190 --> 00:21:27,590
he has been stringing us along.

340
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:29,470
From the first kill to the dungeon records,

341
00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:32,990
from fighting against each other for the final boss to our infighting,

342
00:21:32,990 --> 00:21:36,351
who do you think the final winner is?

343
00:21:36,351 --> 00:21:38,090
It's that Lord Grim.

344
00:21:38,090 --> 00:21:40,530
It does appear that way.

345
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:58,180
   

346
00:22:09,570 --> 00:22:14,370
 Brother, you had better keep it low-key. 

347
00:22:24,090 --> 00:22:26,770
   

348
00:22:26,770 --> 00:22:29,270
   

349
00:22:37,770 --> 00:22:38,910
Thanks.

350
00:22:38,910 --> 00:22:41,550
All you want is this lance?

351
00:22:41,550 --> 00:22:43,390
In a shabby guild like yours,

352
00:22:43,390 --> 00:22:46,050
this is the only distinguished weapon there is.

353
00:22:48,270 --> 00:22:49,570
Such a waste.

354
00:22:49,570 --> 00:22:52,590
In just a few words, he shows his true self.

355
00:22:53,910 --> 00:22:54,810
   

356
00:22:54,810 --> 00:22:56,490
   

357
00:22:56,490 --> 00:22:57,230
   

358
00:22:57,230 --> 00:22:58,910
   

359
00:22:58,910 --> 00:23:00,330
Awesome. Awesome.

360
00:23:00,330 --> 00:23:03,290
   

361
00:23:36,770 --> 00:23:38,950
This new weapon is becoming more and more useful.

362
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:42,070
This orange weapon suits me the most.

363
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:43,630
Sister Tang Rou, what's wrong with you today?

364
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:44,750
You are quite slow.

365
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:48,910
As expected, if you only have the suit without the orange weapon, you can't fight as well as I.

366
00:23:53,270 --> 00:23:55,090
You can fight on your own. I'm going offline now.

367
00:23:55,090 --> 00:23:57,170
   

368
00:23:59,570 --> 00:24:04,330
   
   

369
00:24:08,210 --> 00:24:09,270
 You bought it? 

370
00:24:09,270 --> 00:24:10,730
 It's a trophy. 

371
00:24:11,270 --> 00:24:14,470
 You played through the Desolated Lands and the only thing you want is this? 

372
00:24:14,470 --> 00:24:18,430
 It matches the weapon I bought you the last time. 

373
00:24:18,430 --> 00:24:20,130
   
   

374
00:24:29,530 --> 00:24:32,911
   

375
00:24:32,911 --> 00:24:35,330
Isn't that our record?

376
00:24:36,230 --> 00:24:37,670
Let me see.

377
00:24:37,670 --> 00:24:39,030
It's so detailed.

378
00:24:39,030 --> 00:24:42,110
The way to pass each checkpoint is clearly marked.

379
00:24:43,970 --> 00:24:47,410
The equipment of Steamed Bun Invasion with pictures.

380
00:24:47,410 --> 00:24:50,251
It says all my inventory is orange.

381
00:24:50,251 --> 00:24:52,340
Buddy, do you think we should

382
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:54,010
follow the steps posted

383
00:24:54,010 --> 00:24:56,830
and then create a record of 16.24 minutes?

384
00:24:58,090 --> 00:25:00,690
This guy is a genius.

385
00:25:00,690 --> 00:25:02,390
Indeed, he is a genius.

386
00:25:02,390 --> 00:25:04,090
He can reproduce the complete method of getting through a dungeon

387
00:25:04,090 --> 00:25:06,210
based on the record time.

388
00:25:06,210 --> 00:25:08,070
His calculations are grounded in basic skills.

389
00:25:08,070 --> 00:25:09,950
But what a pity...

390
00:25:09,950 --> 00:25:11,390
What's a pity?

391
00:25:11,390 --> 00:25:14,870
This method requires players to have not only high-end equipment,

392
00:25:14,870 --> 00:25:17,170
but also exquisite techniques.

393
00:25:17,170 --> 00:25:19,390
Normal players simply can't reach that level.

394
00:25:19,390 --> 00:25:20,650
In other words,

395
00:25:20,650 --> 00:25:23,350
this so-called "Strategy for the Inexperienced" is not what it claims to be.

396
00:25:23,350 --> 00:25:25,850
It's only idle theorizing, not practical.

397
00:25:25,850 --> 00:25:27,270
Then why are we wasting time on this?

398
00:25:27,270 --> 00:25:28,290
It's useless.

399
00:25:28,290 --> 00:25:30,550
We can just go and play the dungeon directly.

400
00:25:31,930 --> 00:25:34,150
It is not useless.

401
00:25:34,150 --> 00:25:35,830
It's posted by someone named Concealed Light.

402
00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:37,950
At least, he has the spirit to study it intensively.

403
00:25:37,950 --> 00:25:40,090
If someone points him in the right direction,

404
00:25:40,090 --> 00:25:43,250
maybe he could come up with a really decent strategy guide.

405
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:45,670
Network manager, come turn on a computer, please.

406
00:25:48,290 --> 00:25:50,270
Let's go.

407
00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:52,990
Hello. Your I.D. card.

408
00:25:56,490 --> 00:25:59,290
    
   

409
00:26:00,770 --> 00:26:02,550
It's really crowded here today.

410
00:26:02,550 --> 00:26:04,030
The business is thriving.

411
00:26:04,030 --> 00:26:06,470
Here you go. No.46 in Section B.

412
00:26:06,470 --> 00:26:08,250
Okay, thank you.

413
00:26:12,390 --> 00:26:15,990
I'm sorry, but we need to split you up today.

414
00:26:21,290 --> 00:26:23,130
Yi Fan, you are No.42 in Section B.

415
00:26:23,130 --> 00:26:24,410
Okay.

416
00:26:24,410 --> 00:26:26,030
Bao Zi.

417
00:26:27,890 --> 00:26:29,310
Go upstairs to Section C.

418
00:26:29,310 --> 00:26:30,250
Okay.

419
00:26:30,250 --> 00:26:31,670
Let's go.

420
00:26:59,470 --> 00:27:01,010
 Why are you online now? 

421
00:27:01,010 --> 00:27:03,270
 Didn't you say there was a team event? 

422
00:27:03,270 --> 00:27:05,551
Are you going to Line Canyon Dungeon today?

423
00:27:05,551 --> 00:27:07,410
Take me along.

424
00:27:09,130 --> 00:27:11,690
 You sure have a lot of time, My Lady. 

425
00:27:11,690 --> 00:27:13,790
 You can even play Glory. 

426
00:27:17,630 --> 00:27:21,310
I am sick. I took sick leave today.

427
00:27:23,490 --> 00:27:25,430
 What's wrong? 

428
00:27:25,430 --> 00:27:27,030
 Have you gone to see a doctor? 

429
00:27:27,670 --> 00:27:29,870
I have severe insomnia.

430
00:27:29,870 --> 00:27:32,870
I can't sleep at all during the day.

431
00:27:32,870 --> 00:27:36,230
The doctor said that the more I play Glory, the better.

432
00:27:36,230 --> 00:27:39,200
 The most important thing is to keep myself happy. 

433
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,900
 You... 

434
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:43,269
 All right. We are gathering in Congee Forest. 

435
00:27:43,269 --> 00:27:44,850
Roger.

436
00:27:49,310 --> 00:27:51,731
 This time, we have gathered the elite players from the seven largest guilds 

437
00:27:51,731 --> 00:27:53,430
 in order to take down Lord Grim. 

438
00:27:53,430 --> 00:27:55,710
 Herb Garden Guild won fifth place in the league match. 

439
00:27:55,710 --> 00:27:59,050
 Team Tiny Herb, champion of Season 7, is strong and powerful. 

440
00:27:59,050 --> 00:28:02,590
 Tyrannical Ambition carries on the style developed by their captain, Han Wenqing. 

441
00:28:02,590 --> 00:28:03,750
 They are tough and hard to defeat. 

442
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:05,770
 Players tremble with fear when they hear that name. 

443
00:28:05,770 --> 00:28:08,430
 Not to mention Blossom Valley Guild, Samsara Guild, 

444
00:28:08,430 --> 00:28:09,550
 Wind Howl Guild and Void Walk Guild. 

445
00:28:09,550 --> 00:28:11,250
 With the capabilities of each guild, 

446
00:28:11,250 --> 00:28:13,130
 their strength will be doubled. 

447
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:18,960
   

448
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:25,190
   

449
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,740
   

450
00:28:56,310 --> 00:28:57,770
Cleansing Mist is online.

451
00:28:57,770 --> 00:29:00,570
Position 375, 690.

452
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:04,190
   

453
00:29:04,190 --> 00:29:05,810
He is online now.

454
00:29:10,170 --> 00:29:12,210
Steamed Bun Invasion is online.

455
00:29:14,930 --> 00:29:16,290
A big fish is coming.

456
00:29:16,290 --> 00:29:19,290
Everyone, Lord Grim and his team 
    

457
00:29:19,290 --> 00:29:21,190
are very good and experienced. 
    

458
00:29:21,190 --> 00:29:23,390
We need to work together.

459
00:29:23,390 --> 00:29:27,000
Now, Cleansing Mist, One Inch Ash, and Steamed Bun Invasion

460
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,390
are in different sections of Congee Forest.

461
00:29:29,390 --> 00:29:31,670
They can't gather in such a short time.

462
00:29:31,670 --> 00:29:33,150
We can defeat them one by one.

463
00:29:33,150 --> 00:29:34,610
Everyone lay siege!

464
00:29:34,610 --> 00:29:35,430
Move.

465
00:29:35,430 --> 00:29:37,130
Strangle them.

466
00:30:29,350 --> 00:30:31,010
Go.

467
00:31:00,190 --> 00:31:01,810
It's an ambush.

468
00:31:01,810 --> 00:31:02,970
Watch your surroundings.

469
00:31:02,970 --> 00:31:04,120
There are also 4 here.

470
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:05,950
I've also been ambushed by 4 enemies.

471
00:31:05,950 --> 00:31:09,290
But these rookies are so lame.

472
00:31:09,290 --> 00:31:12,830
Xiao Tang, are you okay?

473
00:31:36,950 --> 00:31:38,650
I was killed.

474
00:31:43,670 --> 00:31:47,030
Xiao Tang, I already asked everyone to assemble in the Congee Forest as planned.

475
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:48,510
You can go to the Congee City to be revived.

476
00:31:48,510 --> 00:31:51,070
But hide for now, save your strength for later.

477
00:31:51,070 --> 00:31:54,710
Lord Grim has no one to use now.

478
00:31:54,710 --> 00:31:56,570
Position 236, 985.

479
00:31:56,570 --> 00:31:58,470
Target Lord Grim.

480
00:32:00,990 --> 00:32:04,290
It appears the game isn't over.

481
00:32:04,290 --> 00:32:06,310
Assemble in the Congee Forest.

482
00:32:06,310 --> 00:32:07,850
- Got it. 
 - No problem.

483
00:32:07,850 --> 00:32:09,500
Stop them from assembling.

484
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:11,330
Wait until they stop, then kill them one by one.

485
00:32:11,330 --> 00:32:13,070
 - Roger that. 
 - Roger that. 

486
00:32:34,550 --> 00:32:37,070
Concentrate fire on One Inch Ash.

487
00:32:42,370 --> 00:32:44,690
What? So many enemies!

488
00:32:44,690 --> 00:32:46,070
Come on! Come and get me!

489
00:32:46,070 --> 00:32:47,890
Come here. Here. Here.

490
00:32:51,510 --> 00:32:52,510
Oh my! Lost him again!

491
00:32:52,510 --> 00:32:55,111
Go and get him! Hurry! What are you waiting for?

492
00:33:31,390 --> 00:33:33,970
Relying solely on our ATK won't be enough to break through their gank.

493
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:35,750
Senior, what should we do?

494
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:37,990
Hide.

495
00:33:37,990 --> 00:33:40,871
Hit him hard! Don't let any of them survive!

496
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:42,800
Have you met up with Yifan?

497
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:44,811
Yes, but there are too many enemies.

498
00:33:44,811 --> 00:33:45,850
We can't break through the encirclement at all.

499
00:33:45,850 --> 00:33:48,300
Let him use Flame Boundaries to give you a boost.

500
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:50,330
Steamed Bun is pretty close to you.

501
00:33:50,330 --> 00:33:52,100
- I'll tell him to go support you. 
 - Roger that.

502
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:53,900
Steamed Bun, how about you?

503
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:57,500
Boss, so many people are chasing me.

504
00:33:57,500 --> 00:34:01,500
What should I do? Run! Run! Run!

505
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:04,100
Find a way to escape. Go.

506
00:34:04,870 --> 00:34:06,530
What happened?

507
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:21,200
Where am I? It's so dark.

508
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:30,100
Guild Leader, we lost Steamed Bun Invasion.

509
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:36,300
He must have found a blind spot to hide in.

510
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:39,310
Let's scatter to search for him.

511
00:34:40,490 --> 00:34:43,830
Oh? They can't see me.

512
00:34:43,830 --> 00:34:45,590
Seems I found a good place.

513
00:34:45,590 --> 00:34:48,250
Void Walk, remain on standby outside Congee City.

514
00:34:48,250 --> 00:34:51,170
After reviving, Cleansing Mist will choose to go to the Congee City.

515
00:34:51,170 --> 00:34:52,650
Killing is not allowed in the city.

516
00:34:52,650 --> 00:34:54,800
Once they step outside of the city, immediately kill them.

517
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,000
Roger that.

518
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,700
None of them will survive this time.

519
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:04,500
   

520
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:06,250
   

521
00:35:27,070 --> 00:35:30,030
   

522
00:35:30,030 --> 00:35:32,430
   

523
00:35:32,430 --> 00:35:37,300
   

524
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:57,200
We lost Steamed Bun.

525
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:59,470
Things are worse than we thought.

526
00:35:59,470 --> 00:36:02,630
Right now, stay in Congee City. Wait for an opportunity.

527
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:07,800
   

528
00:36:16,590 --> 00:36:18,450
   

529
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:23,890
   

530
00:36:33,130 --> 00:36:34,890
Excellent Dynasty team members,

531
00:36:34,890 --> 00:36:37,550
get ready to encircle Lord Grim.

532
00:37:17,970 --> 00:37:20,310
Why bother to be masked as a smurf (low-ranked player)?

533
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,900
To give you a surprise! Are you happy?

534
00:37:25,270 --> 00:37:27,710
Don't let any of them go. Kill them all.

535
00:37:27,710 --> 00:37:29,470
Go!

536
00:37:34,831 --> 00:37:37,300
Oh my! So many enemies!

537
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:39,600
Ye, did you stir up a hornet's nest?

538
00:37:40,910 --> 00:37:44,910
You noobs are really brave.

539
00:37:44,910 --> 00:37:47,590
Keep coming? Why? Want to be taught a lesson?

540
00:37:47,590 --> 00:37:49,830
All right, I will teach you a lesson.

541
00:37:49,830 --> 00:37:52,190
You are doomed.

542
00:38:00,650 --> 00:38:02,890
Old Ye, you're heartless, running off without me?

543
00:38:02,890 --> 00:38:05,330
Wait for me! Wait!

544
00:38:30,131 --> 00:38:32,130
Now nobody is here. Come clean, Old Ye.

545
00:38:32,130 --> 00:38:33,600
What unethical thing have you done?

546
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:36,300
Steal their inventory or steal someone's girlfriend?

547
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:39,211
Let me guess. I bet Cleansing Mist is upset about you retiring from Glory.

548
00:38:39,211 --> 00:38:41,670
So he decided to follow you until you came back.

549
00:38:41,670 --> 00:38:44,110
No? Then don't tell me. Let me guess again.

550
00:38:44,110 --> 00:38:45,370
Oh... I see.

551
00:38:45,370 --> 00:38:48,130
It must be like this! Your plot was revealed.

552
00:38:48,130 --> 00:38:49,430
That's why everyone is chasing you. Am I right?

553
00:38:49,431 --> 00:38:51,270
We just broke a dungeon record.

554
00:38:51,270 --> 00:38:52,870
You deserve it, Old Ye.

555
00:38:52,870 --> 00:38:56,010
What's your level? Competing with these newbies for the dungeon?

556
00:38:56,010 --> 00:38:57,800
You are getting more and more shameless.

557
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:59,500
What's so shameful?

558
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:02,970
I am just a common player. Getting a record is an obligation.

559
00:39:02,970 --> 00:39:07,110
But you haven't experienced such a huge battle for a long time.

560
00:39:07,110 --> 00:39:09,830
- Scared? 
 - Don't curse me!

561
00:39:09,830 --> 00:39:12,350
Are you kidding me? I'm scared? Who am I scared of?

562
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:13,710
Then why did you run?

563
00:39:13,710 --> 00:39:17,100
I come here to PK with you, not for these noobs.

564
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:20,400
All right, no more talk. I am going to open the PK field.

565
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:23,750
I'll give you one minute to PK me. PK. PK.

566
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:36,900
Shh.

567
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:26,200
Under the tree, follow me.

568
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:36,400
Fire.

569
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:47,300
