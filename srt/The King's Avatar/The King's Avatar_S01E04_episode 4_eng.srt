 "Light From the Ashes" - Cai Weize 

2
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:06,240
♫  Countless fireflies born from insignificance  ♫

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:10,130
♫  Riding the long wind to gather into a shining galaxy  ♫

4
00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:14,000
♫  Proclaim to the world on top of the sky  ♫

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,990
♫  We will return in glory  ♫

6
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:23,610
♫  Clear the clouds and descend with the heat  ♫

7
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:27,420
♫  Melting ice and snow, overcoming twists and turns  ♫

8
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:31,160
♫  Finally at this moment of peak  ♫

9
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:35,340
♫  There is a figure that coincides with the past  ♫

10
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:39,060
♫  The glory of the past that never came  ♫

11
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:42,730
♫  The pride that the future will never pass  ♫

12
00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:46,400
 Our fingertips intertwined and condensed  ♫

13
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:50,490
♫  Into a song that ignited the battlefield  ♫

14
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:54,170
♫  The only light in an endless night  ♫

15
00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:58,060
♫  Is you and me who overcame mediocrity  ♫

16
00:00:58,060 --> 00:01:01,840
♫  Up on the clouds and down in the dust  ♫

17
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:05,580
♫  Fireflies making every effort to illuminate  ♫

18
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:09,480
♫  I came from the legend to carry on a legend  ♫

19
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:13,550
♫  Once it's disruptive, a decade of persistence won't be in vain  ♫

20
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:17,340
♫  Up on the clouds and down in the dust  ♫

21
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:20,940
♫  Fireflies making every effort to illuminate  ♫

22
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:24,790
♫  Fireflies making every effort to illuminate  ♫

23
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:27,960
   

24
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:30,280
   

25
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:38,080
This circle he's drawn represents that we will fight together.

26
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:39,912
Inside the circle is the pure land,

27
00:01:39,912 --> 00:01:42,240
outside is the battlefield.

28
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,800
That's right, isn't it?

29
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:48,400
What I mean is, you guys shouldn't move out of the circle.

30
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:55,820
But...

31
00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:06,980
 Subtitles and Timing provided to you by💥🍥 TEAM 7️⃣ 🍥💥 @viki.com 

32
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,360
What is his plan?

33
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,560
How dare he face the monster alone?

34
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:39,020
Did he kill the monster, or was he eaten by it?

35
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:40,720
I'll go and check.

36
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:44,940
We need to give him a few more minutes.

37
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:47,200
The expert has his own strategy.

38
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,360
We must show our tolerance.

39
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:52,060
Then our tolerance is...

40
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:53,860
Waiting.

41
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,480
Fifteen minutes have passed.

42
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,880
We've shown our tolerance well enough, right?

43
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,060
Yes.

44
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:46,560
Then, the expert's strategy is...

45
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:54,761
There are only five minutes left to break the record. 
    

46
00:03:54,761 --> 00:03:56,160
If we don't go out of the circle,

47
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:59,340
we could become the biggest joke in the history of Glory.

48
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:00,713
This is called "Responding to changes by staying still."

49
00:04:00,713 --> 00:04:02,640
We are turning ourselves into a joke by not moving.

50
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,240
Guild Master.

51
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:19,720
Everyone, get ready.

52
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:24,320
I'll count down from three.

53
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,600
Then out of the circle.

54
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,520
Three.

55
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:30,320
Three.

56
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,740
Two.

57
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:43,080
 Congratulations to the players of Blue Brook Guild, 

58
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:48,080
 Blue River, Thundering Light, Lord Grim, Flower Lantern, and Bound Boat 

59
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,120
 for breaking the Frost Forest record 

60
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:53,960
 within 15 minutes and 24.11 seconds. 

61
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,840
He did it! Only 15 minutes.

62
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,920
It is a whole five minutes faster.

63
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:06,860
What did I say.

64
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:09,240
This is the expert I invited.

65
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:12,660
This is called "winning all by staying still."

66
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:17,480
With Lord Grim,

67
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:21,800
the world of the 10th server belongs to Blue Brook Guild.

68
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:28,880
Don't move! Don't move, don't move.

69
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,960
The expert must be looking for me.

70
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:39,960
 Lord Grim has left Blue Brook Guild. 

71
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:42,820
What?

72
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,920
It's over.

73
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,020
Go, leave.

74
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:48,260
Go.

75
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:49,560
You get me a cup of coffee.

76
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,380
- Quickly. 
 - Okay.

77
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:51,680
You,

78
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,720
g-go water the flowers.

79
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:56,360
You.

80
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,080
Forget it.

81
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:07,640
   
   

82
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:21,273
   

83
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:38,300
   
   

84
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:44,500
Xiao Tang, why don't you choose a Launcher like me?

85
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:46,320
I can teach you about it.

86
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:51,160
But I like to see my opponent falling in front of me.

87
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:54,160
Here. Then choose Battlemage.

88
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,440
My idol, One Autumn Leaf, is in this profession.

89
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:58,880
   
   

90
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,460
 I, Tang Rou, will never lose to anybody. 

91
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:05,930
   

92
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,400
Everybody.

93
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:22,000
Mucheng.

94
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,440
Today is the first training session with our new captain.

95
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,520
This is our brand new synergy

96
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:30,580
and more so, a mutual understanding.

97
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:33,660
I believe with Sun Xiang's joining in,

98
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:35,700
and the efforts of all of you here,

99
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:39,800
Excellent Era will surely create another brilliant future.

100
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:44,940
My goal is to build a new dynasty for Excellent Era.

101
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:51,740
Starting from today, Sun Xiang is the core of our Excellent Era Dynasty.

102
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:54,660
He'll shoulder the responsibility as the captain

103
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:57,000
to complete the captain's mission.

104
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,700
Sun Xiang,

105
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:03,220
Excellent Era's future depends on you.

106
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:08,220
We will fight Blue Rain in the next competition.

107
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:09,780
Now, start simulation training.

108
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:11,760
Everyone, start training.

109
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:14,140
Congratulations to Chairman Tao for getting an excellent talent.

110
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:15,640
Thank you.

111
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:18,640
Ye Qiu's revenge on me was personal.

112
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:21,020
Fortunately, the petty guy was driven away.

113
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:27,080
Do you think I can return...

114
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:31,880
Ye Qiu retired voluntarily.

115
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:34,180
No one forced him out.

116
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:39,840
Yehui, you can eat whatever you like, but you should speak carefully.

117
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:43,680
Sorry. I have no other intentions.

118
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:46,760
I just want to return.

119
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:52,320
When Ye Qiu drove you away, he was still the captain.

120
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,600
Everyone, attack with everything.

121
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:12,000
Striker in the middle. Qi Master, cover him.

122
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,780
Launcher, keep up. Faster.

123
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:05,160
Launcher, attack to break their rhythm.

124
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:19,380
Launcher, what's the matter with you? You are always so slow.

125
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:22,980
Launchers do not rely on speed to win.

126
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:27,420
For fast speed, you use Assassins and Ninjas.

127
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:30,700
Do you mean there is something wrong with my tactical arrangement?

128
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:32,560
Have you arranged tactics?

129
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:35,600
Sorry, I didn't see any cooperation.

130
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:39,520
I only saw everyone following you, recklessly running around.

131
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:42,120
That's because you can't keep pace with me.

132
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,660
What era is it now?

133
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:45,680
Launcher still moves behind as support?

134
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:49,300
I think you were too comfortable while Ye Qiu was the captain.

135
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:52,100
That's why you are not used to this new playing style.

136
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:56,460
Ye Qiu's tactics are just that he fights in front and finds good positions.

137
00:10:56,460 --> 00:11:00,320
While you hide behind in a blind corner to attack.

138
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,440
Over and over again, just a few moves.

139
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:07,960
It's so boring. Even if you're used to it, I'm tired of seeing it.

140
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:20,370
   

141
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:30,540
Not bad. You answered the phone after three rings.

142
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:34,300
It seems that you've been living idly these days.

143
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:36,440
I don't have a choice.

144
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:37,890
Recently, friends have called me one after another

145
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:39,900
sneering at my miserable situation.

146
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:42,560
It's already a conditioned reflex once I hear my phone ring.

147
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,120
Liar.

148
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:46,460
Your phone has always been on silent.

149
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:48,640
You never answer a call from anyone.

150
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:52,740
To look for you, one has to be in front of you and shout in your face.

151
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:55,400
Then quickly appear to yell at me.

152
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,400
You're not in front of me.

153
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,940
Aren't I?

154
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:10,200
 Why aren't your room's curtains fixed yet? 

155
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:13,260
Are you in my room?

156
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:18,020
I just wanted to see if you changed your room's password.

157
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:22,700
Hey, do you still remember your room's password?

158
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:26,300
 First, don't scold anyone at the strategy debrief meeting tomorrow. 

159
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:29,680
 Second, if you want to scold someone, don't scold me. 

160
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:32,060
 Third, even if you want to scold me, 

161
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:33,960
 no more than three sentences. 

162
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:35,960
 What about the fourth? 

163
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:41,200
First, at the training meeting, don't get angry at the new teammates.

164
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:45,000
 Second, even if you get angry, don't sulk. 

165
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,760
 Just scold them if you need to. 

166
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:53,120
Third, if you sulk, don't go past three minutes.

167
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,720
Fourth.

168
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:58,280
 Fourth. 

169
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:04,140
When angry and sad, rush across the street from Excellent Era and shout.

170
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:07,300
Shout what?

171
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:09,100
Shout...

172
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:11,600
one, two, three, four.

173
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:16,560
From now on, don't miss my call.

174
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:44,500
 "One, two, three, four 

175
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:49,400
 This string of simple numbers is all the tacit understanding between us. 

176
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:52,300
 But I still want to stand in front of you 

177
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:54,900
 to press these four numbers for you. 

178
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:15,200
   

179
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:25,820
My idol.

180
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:35,480
Boss, I'll come back to you later.

181
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:38,100
 It will be Excellent Era's year-end press conference soon. 
   

182
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:41,500
 Should we organize an activity to support Ye Qiu? 
   

183
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:46,040
 The time has come to support our idol. 

184
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:49,000
 I'll pay all the expenses. Come on. 

185
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:58,980
 Seems like I need to show you something big to interest you all. 

186
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,180
 Possibility in impossibility 
   

187
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:06,660
 is the best interpretation of our idol, Ye Qiu's competitive spirit. 

188
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:08,560
 His unique skill, Dragon Raising Its Head, 

189
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:11,800
 is also a legend in the history of Glory. 

190
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:14,660
 First, use the strongest Battlemage blade-level move, 

191
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:16,660
 Rising Dragon Soars the Sky. 

192
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:19,341
 Then use his invincible hand speed and micro-operations 

193
00:16:19,341 --> 00:16:21,940
 to forcibly change the trajectory of Rising Dragon Soars the Sky, 

194
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:25,583
 making it impossible for the opponent to evade the attack at all. 

195
00:16:25,583 --> 00:16:27,600
 He has proven with his strength that 

196
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:31,060
 there is no strongest, only stronger. 

197
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:36,400
 Such an excellent video still can't attract you all. 

198
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:38,120
 What are you all doing? 

199
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:40,300
Boss, what's wrong out there? So noisy outside.

200
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:42,980
- I lost the game because of it. 
 - Sorry, sorry.

201
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:44,420
I... I'll go out and have a look.

202
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:47,780
- Xiao Chu, I'll take a look. 
 - Hurry up then.

203
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:01,081
- Over there, over there. Tear it off. Lever it. 
 - Hey!

204
00:17:01,081 --> 00:17:03,920
- Be careful. Quickly now. 
 - What are you doing? Do you know who he is?

205
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:06,121
Who cares? I just work for the money.

206
00:17:06,121 --> 00:17:08,741
Stop looking. Hurry up and tear it off.

207
00:17:08,741 --> 00:17:10,220
All right.

208
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:23,400
He is One Autumn Leaf, who uses Dragon Raising Its Head.

209
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:30,440
   

210
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:58,900
♫  Your old coat is like a sturdy umbrella  ♫

211
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:07,860
♫  That protects me from the harshness of the weather  ♫

212
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:19,020
♫  You are like my exclusive detective  ♫

213
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:27,760
♫  Every movement and expression is seen by you  ♫

214
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:36,240
♫  In my heart is the most amazing you  ♫

215
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:40,880
♫  Some days time just slips away  ♫

216
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:45,200
♫  Other days it seems to stand still  ♫

217
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:53,560
♫  In my heart is the dearest you  ♫

218
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:57,980
♫  My constant, unwavering support  ♫

219
00:18:57,980 --> 00:19:03,560
♫  And also my unbreakable vow  ♫

220
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:09,500
♫  I'm always thinking of you  ♫

221
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,900
 - We won! 
 - Nice! 

222
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:23,980
 My father is a fan of Ye Qiu. 

223
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:26,520
 Such a virtual role 

224
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:29,000
 let this group of people of different ages and occupations, 

225
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,100
 and adults who don't even know each other 

226
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:36,920
 become a group of loyal and passionate youngsters. 

227
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:38,880
 Father running this internet cafe 

228
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:43,040
 is more like managing his dream for Glory. 

229
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:48,400
 He told me that in one's life, there will be many impossible moments. 

230
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,620
 We must learn to live in these desperate situations 

231
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:52,180
 and constantly break through oneself 

232
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:55,740
 to look for unlimited possibilities for growth. 

233
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:01,180
 After Father died, I refused to sell the internet cafe. 

234
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:05,120
 I firmly believe that I understand the meaning of One Autumn Leaf. 

235
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,840
 I can become the real boss of Happy Internet Cafe 

236
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:10,160
 and make Father proud. 

237
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:15,840
 But today, 

238
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:18,400
 you left, 

239
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,300
 and was replaced. 

240
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:25,590
 My spiritual worship was destroyed. 

241
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:27,580
   

242
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:32,160
♫  And also my unbreakable vow  ♫

243
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:39,680
♫  In my heart is the most amazing you  ♫

244
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:45,260
♫  Transform every mundane moment  ♫

245
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:49,600
♫  Into captivating experiences  ♫

246
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:57,800
♫  In my heart is the dearest you  ♫

247
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:05,240
 Dad, you helped me choose Launcher as my profession. 

248
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:07,440
 You said no matter how far my target is, 

249
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:10,440
 as long as I focus my aim and never give up, 

250
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:12,740
 I'll hit my target. 

251
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:17,000
 I will not give up, 

252
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,340
 whether it's the internet cafe 

253
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:21,760
 or One Autumn Leaf. 

254
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:24,400
Xiao Tang.

255
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:34,800
Xiao Tang, did you study strategies all night?

256
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,780
"No One Autumn Leaf"? 
    

257
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:39,781
Guo Guo, can I help you?

258
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:51,740
This persistent spirit of yours reflect those in eSports.

259
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:54,540
I stayed up all night. But the effect is not significant.

260
00:21:54,540 --> 00:22:00,240
Actually, Ye Qiu's play style is not something newbies like us can master.

261
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:04,520
He is an expert at creating miracles from the impossible.

262
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:07,000
It is called having brilliant tactics.

263
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:13,040
We can only grasp an understanding, but not master it.

264
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:15,040
You know so much about him.

265
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:25,340
The network manager told me this.

266
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:28,940
What you're saying sounds like a lie.

267
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:34,940
A confident truth is the truth.

268
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:37,180
Where does your confidence come from?

269
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:39,220
My confidence?

270
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:43,880
From the network manager.

271
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:45,540
Network Manager, come here.

272
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:47,640
Boss, wait a minute.

273
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:48,920
Xiao Tang, let me tell you something.

274
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:53,680
My Network manager imitates Ye Qiu just like Ye Qiu himself.

275
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:55,540
Not to mention you.

276
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:58,440
I won't compete with your network manager.

277
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:02,060
After all, his name is like Ye Qiu, so he wins.

278
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:07,000
Just by looking at the strategy, it doesn't work at all.

279
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,680
You need actual combat training.

280
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:12,340
You practice with him first.

281
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,340
Thank you.

282
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:17,500
Your network manager has already played with me.

283
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:18,980
He is handsome and speaks clearly.

284
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:21,880
He is also polite. You can let him stay.

285
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:24,160
I'm not talking about that kind of training.

286
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:26,360
If you don't want to practice, it's okay. Actually...

287
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:27,800
Actually what?

288
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:30,140
Is this a question of training?

289
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:35,700
It is... Come here. It's a question of homework for me or my control over her.

290
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:42,610
If she focuses on training,

291
00:23:42,610 --> 00:23:45,180
she won't have time to ask about your homework.

292
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:48,100
This is a clever redirecting tactic.

293
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:50,000
You flatter me.

294
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:53,200
Everything is now ready except for one last piece.

295
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,900
Do you know who that is?

296
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:57,940
It's you.

297
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:00,320
I can't.

298
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:02,480
She is in fields beyond my knowledge.

299
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:05,440
I really don't understand her temper and thoughts.

300
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,240
She's too far out of my reach.

301
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:11,160
Come. Sit down.

302
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:14,520
Sit properly.

303
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:17,000
First, add friends to establish contact.

304
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:19,920
What are you waiting for?

305
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,880
Fine.

306
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,660
You little brat.

307
00:24:29,283 --> 00:24:31,289
   

308
00:24:32,169 --> 00:24:34,229
   

309
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:43,140
See? I was rejected mercilessly.

310
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:44,980
Wait a minute.

311
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:46,660
Refusal is a woman's natural privilege.

312
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:48,100
Being reserved is a woman's innate trait.

313
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:49,600
As a man, do you know what trait you should have?

314
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:52,940
Shameless determination. Keep adding her.

315
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:55,960
As a man, I have my own dignity.

316
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:56,840
What?

317
00:24:56,840 --> 00:25:00,860
When the girl is interested, shameless persistence is called determination.

318
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:03,660
But if she is not, that shameless persistence

319
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:05,720
is called being tactless.

320
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:09,800
Really? Why do I feel like

321
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:14,120
you forget who the boss is and who the network manager here is?

322
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:18,480
Why don't we calculate your debt?

323
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:23,200
Or you can take another look

324
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,180
at who the boss here is?

325
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:31,980
I know, I know you are the boss.

326
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:34,240
How about your dignity?

327
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:42,940
You brat, add her.

328
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:05,060
Adding her is like going through an iron wall.

329
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:06,940
 Did you watch the match yesterday? 

330
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:07,900
 Yes, I did. 

331
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:10,081
 - It was amazing. 
 - Very good. 

332
00:26:10,081 --> 00:26:13,140
The players have all arrived. They are waiting for your decision.

333
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:16,520
Blood Gunner Yagg, are you sure of that?

334
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:17,860
We got the news from our spy in the Herb Garden Guild.

335
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:19,340
The map was refreshed just a minute ago.

336
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:21,281
Herb Garden's Plantago Seed and the others have already rushed over there.

337
00:26:21,281 --> 00:26:23,620
Tyrannical Ambition Guild will soon arrive, too.

338
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:25,880
Okay, hurry up.

339
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:27,620
Hurry and log on.

340
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:29,421
- Okay, let's go. 
 - Quickly log on.

341
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:31,180
You log on first. I'll be back soon.

342
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:32,940
Where are you going?

343
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:43,660
All of you, focus.

344
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:46,780
Captain Jiexi is watching you all here.

345
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:50,760
Herb Garden must kill the boss this time.

346
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:53,800
Captain Jiexi cannot be humiliated. Do you understand?

347
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:54,820
 Understood! 

348
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:56,320
Everybody, listen up.

349
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:59,980
Although we won the first kill last time, it took half an hour.

350
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:03,380
This kind of mistake is absolutely not allowed this time.

351
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:04,740
 Yes, Guild Master! 

352
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:06,280
What is your goal?

353
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:08,840
 High level, high efficiency, and high concentration! 

354
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:12,940
Good. This is your moment to show your capabilities.

355
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:15,460
Blood Gunner Yagg will be ours!

356
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:16,920
Get ready, everyone.

357
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:19,420
Victory is just ahead.

358
00:27:37,180 --> 00:27:39,080
Tyrannical Ambition Guild has arrived.

359
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:41,641
Its leader is the shameless man called Cold Night.

360
00:27:41,641 --> 00:27:43,440
Herb Garden Guild has also arrived.

361
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:45,580
Plantago Seed arrived long ago with his group.

362
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:47,820
But the two guilds haven't launched attacks yet.

363
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:49,340
   

364
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:54,000
This Blood Gunner is too powerful.

365
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,940
Whichever guild attacks first will be the first to lose.

366
00:27:56,940 --> 00:28:00,120
Let's see what their plans are.

367
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:01,760
You got here really fast.

368
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,760
Not as fast as you who can fly.

369
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,100
Who will attack first?

370
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:06,580
You, you do it first.

371
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:09,800
You first, and we Tyrannical Ambition will follow.

372
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:12,260
We can attack first, but don't try to steal if you dare.

373
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:15,240
Exactly. I don't want to die for Tyrannical Ambition.

374
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:16,261
You're one to talk.

375
00:28:16,261 --> 00:28:18,920
As a man dumped by Lord Grim, it's shameful for you to even be here.

376
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:21,321
Shame on you. Did you plant a spy in my guild again?

377
00:28:21,321 --> 00:28:25,080
Old Blue, you were dumped? So miserable.

378
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:27,940
I really want to see how green* your face is right now. 
  (*Embarrassment) 

379
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:29,560
Not greener than your Herb Garden's faces.

380
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:31,520
All right, cut the crap.

381
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:34,340
Soon, the more guilds come, the less chance we have.

382
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:38,280
Why don't we do this together?

383
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:39,420
How about it?

384
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:41,220
- Fine. 
 - Fine.

385
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:44,560
 Three. 

386
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:47,180
 Two. 

387
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:49,880
One.

388
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:55,400
Why aren't you going?

389
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:57,620
We are preparing. Why didn't you go?

390
00:28:57,620 --> 00:29:00,000
We are also preparing for it.

391
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:04,300
Who is attacking the monster there?

392
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:27,520
Facing Blood Gunner's shooting from all directions, and he's not hurt at all.

393
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:29,480
Damn, he's impressive.

394
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:31,700
So cool.

395
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:35,140
Steamed Bun Invasion? Where did such an expert come from? 
    

396
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:41,460
Nice knee attack.

397
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:43,880
He counterattacks while being attacked.

398
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:45,200
His game sense is not bad.

399
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,600
Here comes another expert.

400
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:50,600
Flexible mechanics and spot-on attacks.

401
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:52,660
He moves like a dancer.

402
00:29:59,180 --> 00:30:02,020
Doesn't Sand Toss cause a blind effect only when it hits the eyes?

403
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:05,620
Why is he aiming at its head?

404
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:19,140
His game sense is equal to nothing.

405
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:20,081
That's impressive.

406
00:30:20,081 --> 00:30:23,140
I have never seen such a cool method of suicide before.

407
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:25,240
I thought it was a big meat bun,

408
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:27,620
it turns out to be a small white steamed bun without stuffing.

409
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:30,980
Turns out he is a super newbie. A Glory noob.

410
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:38,020
Why don't you two go up and help.

411
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:41,800
All right, let's go. I'll cover for you two.

412
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:44,300
Old Night, I know what you're thinking.

413
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:45,840
Too obvious.

414
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:50,880
Old Plantago and I will not fight with each other and let you win easily.

415
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:57,140
There's not much HP left. That Bun won't make it.

416
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:04,920
Are we really just standing here?

417
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:07,580
- Wait. 
 - Again?

418
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:10,180
An expert has his own strategy.

419
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:11,961
 You log on first. I'll be back soon. Go. 

420
00:31:11,961 --> 00:31:13,840
 Where are you going? 

421
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:18,940
 Brother Expert, we are planning to attack Blood Gunner. 

422
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:20,840
 Are you interested? 

423
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:23,900
 Yes. 

424
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:28,260
 Are the conditions the same? 

425
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:31,640
 Send me the coordinates. 

426
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:47,260
Brother Expert, you are here!

427
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:49,520
We are all ready.

428
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:50,880
Let's fight together later.

429
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:52,640
We Blue Brook Guild are under your command.

430
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:55,340
All the rare materials are yours.

431
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:58,540
Old Blue, you're not playing fair by asking for external aid again.

432
00:31:58,540 --> 00:32:01,440
Killing Blood Gunner is a task for those who are capable.

433
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:03,940
I have the ability to find external aid. How am I not playing fair?

434
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:07,420
Right. Kill the Boss with your own skills. 
    

435
00:32:09,370 --> 00:32:11,570
   

436
00:32:13,830 --> 00:32:15,320
   

437
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:19,260
What?

438
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:22,800
Brother Expert, why did you form a team with others?

439
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:27,360
Old Blue, you were dumped again.

440
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:29,580
My condolences.

441
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:33,320
What do you know? This is a strategy.

442
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:38,840
You bring in an expert to form a wild team. Impressive!

443
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:52,281
Ten o'clock position. Use Sand Toss at the Gunner's eyes.

444
00:32:52,281 --> 00:32:56,540
Quick moves or the right movies... I suggest you choose the latter.

445
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:00,400
Don't stop attacking. Move to the 6 o'clock position.

446
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:02,300
Use Brick Buster.

447
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:03,500
Don't throw it.

448
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:06,700
Directly hit the back of his head to double the damage.

449
00:33:07,540 --> 00:33:08,940
Uppercut.

450
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:21,600
Bun, slow down your attacks.

451
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,100
We have to control the rhythm.

452
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:24,980
 Why? 

453
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:30,260
Wait for the fishermen.

454
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:42,220
Damn, tacit and accurate teamwork.

455
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:44,340
The newbie is totally different now.

456
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:48,300
Was he... pretending earlier?

457
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:50,540
Old Blue, say something.

458
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:52,160
What kind of strategy is this? I can't understand it.

459
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:54,260
Guild Master, what is Lord Grim's plan?

460
00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:55,700
Blood Gunner is on the verge of being killed.

461
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:57,400
Lord Grim is decreasing their output.

462
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:58,900
They're not going to make it.

463
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:01,520
It's the perfect time to attack now. You cowards.

464
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:03,400
It's just fighting head-on. Nothing to be afraid of.

465
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:05,700
Tyrannical Ambition, follow me.

466
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:08,500
Herb Garden is following after Tyrannical Ambition.

467
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:12,640
Guild Master.

468
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:13,960
Forget it, let's go!

469
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:15,660
 Copy. 

470
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,900
They took the bait. Bun, full output.

471
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:30,860
Okay.

472
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:32,460
Uppercut.

473
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:44,981
Bun, at the one o'clock direction, hide behind the large stone. Stay safe.

474
00:34:44,981 --> 00:34:46,700
Lord Grim and Bun ran away.

475
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:48,500
It seems that they have reached the limit of attack.

476
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:51,120
You guys attacked too early. The first to attack dies first.

477
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:53,620
 That's right. 

478
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:00,260
Want to run?

479
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:15,600
- Blood Gunner is going berserk! 
 - Oh no!

480
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:18,620
G-Going berserk?

481
00:35:18,620 --> 00:35:23,000
- Be careful. 
 - Withdraw, withdraw, withdraw.

482
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:43,480
Hurry up and run!

483
00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:46,620
Too late.

484
00:35:56,480 --> 00:36:01,660
I lost? As a Guild Master, how could I lose in a jungle area?

485
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:05,000
Lord Grim, you jerk.

486
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,400
Lord Grim.

487
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,580
Don't let me meet you in Glory in the future.

488
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:09,870
What should we do in case we meet him?

489
00:36:09,870 --> 00:36:12,760
Of course, we will solicit him.

490
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:17,240
Start our output performance.

491
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:49,420
 Congratulations to Lord Grim and Steamed Bun Invasion 

492
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:52,400
 for the first kill on Blood Gunner Yagg. 

493
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:09,360
This is my first kill.

494
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:11,440
Expert, you are awesome.

495
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:13,180
You played well, too.

496
00:37:13,180 --> 00:37:15,120
Yes, I also think I played well.

497
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:17,920
Expert, call me to fight next time.

498
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:20,300
Sure, no problem.

499
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:27,500
 My name is Bao Rongxing, a warehouse keeper. 

500
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:29,720
 My friends always call me Bao Zi (Bun). 

501
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:31,700
 In addition to enjoying the satisfaction my work gives me, 

502
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:34,420
 my hobby during my free time is playing Glory. 

503
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:37,580
 I didn't expect to gain an expert's recognition today. 

504
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:39,880
 My dream is to join a professional team, 

505
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:41,440
 play in a real match, 

506
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:44,380
 and become a real professional esports player. 

507
00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:48,340
The guild master lost the match just now.

508
00:37:48,340 --> 00:37:50,180
What? Impossible. 
    

509
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:52,500
I heard that there was an expert.

510
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,440
 Expert, you didn't help me. 

511
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:16,320
 You said it yourself, the boss belongs to the capable player. 

512
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:20,960
 You humiliated Tyrannical Ambition and Herb Garden. 

513
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:23,520
 I bet they'll blacklist you to get revenge. 

514
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:27,400
 Really? I just talked with them 

515
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:29,800
 and have agreed to dungeon together next time. 

516
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:35,620
 Those two have no bottom lines and even invited you to dungeon together? 

517
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:38,220
 Don't you also want to? 

518
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:43,700
 I do. 

519
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:45,300
 Which one? 

520
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,200
 The Boneyard. 

521
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:50,700
 Prepare the items. 

522
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:53,300
 I'll let you know when I have time. 

523
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:59,540
The expert is still on our side.

524
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:03,800
  
   

525
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:05,400
 Items dropped from dungeons 

526
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:07,760
 have a limited effect in upgrading the weapon attributes. 

527
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:11,740
 But using rare items to upgrade weapons can max out their stats. 

528
00:39:11,740 --> 00:39:15,240
 So the best weapons must use rare items. 

529
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:17,000
 The rarity of items does not lie in their drop rate 

530
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,600
 but in the spawn rate of the hidden boss. 

531
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:23,040
 That is the meaning of "rare". 

532
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:26,450
   
   

533
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,900
You won again?

534
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:41,600
Just a little luck.

535
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:48,540
It is clear that you are powerful.

536
00:39:48,540 --> 00:39:52,600
One must keep it low-key when modesty calls for it.

537
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:55,900
When it's time to be flashy, one must show off.

538
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:02,100
I... I really don't have a strategy.

539
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:05,160
You are really experienced.

540
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:09,000
Adding her as a friend failed, and the files were rejected.

541
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:12,880
What can I do? I am also very helpless.

542
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:17,610
If you failed to add her as a friend,

543
00:40:17,610 --> 00:40:19,500
you can teach her using words and actions.

544
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:22,600
If she refuses your files, you can change your strategy.

545
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:25,060
There's nothing I can do either.

546
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:28,220
I am also very irritable.

547
00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:29,940
"Irritable" can't solve the problem either.

548
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:32,860
Are you sure you can't finish the task?

549
00:40:32,860 --> 00:40:34,760
I...

550
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:41,640
can definitely finish the task

551
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:44,720
under your guidance, Boss.

552
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:48,180
The deadline is 24 hours.

553
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:50,740
When the time runs out, you either succeed

554
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:54,060
or you die trying.
