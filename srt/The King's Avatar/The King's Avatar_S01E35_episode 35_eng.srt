Could you ever compete with me for one more time?

This time...

26
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,560
I'd still let you win.

28
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,440
What happened?

29
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:01,890
- What... What are you doing?
- Give it to me...

30
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:09,790
You did this?

31
00:02:09,790 --> 00:02:12,660
Don't... How could it be me?

32
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:14,730
It was me. It had nothing to do with him.

33
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:16,840
I'll pay you for whatever it costs.

34
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:19,380
Cool. You do it.

35
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:21,180
Give me the money.

36
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:22,590
Fine.

37
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,700
Now what?

38
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:32,540
Your money was stolen?

39
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:34,600
Come here, you.

40
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,240
Come here!

 Subtitles and Timing provided to you by💥🍥 TEAM 7️⃣ 🍥💥 @viki.com 

42
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,180
I'm overwhelmed.

43
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:48,410
It's the first time
to see someone played arcade games

44
00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:50,800
when having a fever of 39℃.

45
00:02:55,670 --> 00:02:56,910
By the way...

46
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:58,160
I'll go buy medicine for him.

47
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,860
You take care of him.

48
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:01,620
Don't touch his favorite toy.

49
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:04,330
Brother! The Transformer's arm was broken.

50
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:06,470
It has nothing to do with me.

51
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,560
We clowned around together...

52
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,360
We kept each other warm...

53
00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:18,580
We went through the chaos of our adolescence...

54
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:21,800
I still remember what you said to me.

55
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:24,360
"We shouldn't be too furious in early youth.

56
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:28,120
Because life is still long."

57
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:34,520
Are these the ones we broke last time?

58
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,900
Yep.

59
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:38,270
I bought both of them.

60
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:41,560
Why did you buy the broken ones?

61
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:46,640
 ♫ You cover your unwillingness with a smile ♫ 

62
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:49,100
I bought them...

63
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:51,870
to get your lucky coins back!

64
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:58,490
Anyways, you can fix anything.

65
00:03:58,490 --> 00:04:01,580
So, fix these two machines!

66
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,520
Wait! Come back!

67
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,600
Where did you get the money?

68
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,420
Did you rob a bank?

69
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:12,530
What I did is much better than robbing a bank.

70
00:04:14,210 --> 00:04:15,700
Look!

71
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:19,700
I earned it with my talent! 
  

72
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,440
You won the champion?

73
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:28,400
You can't squander your money
even if you are the champion!

74
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:34,300
♫ ♫

75
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:39,670
 ♫ You are my dearest in my heart ♫ 

76
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:41,230
Great!

77
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:43,650
I was the first one to play the game.

78
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:45,650
No one can compete with me.

79
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:46,940
How brazen!

80
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:49,480
You even dare to boast
before the national champion.

81
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:51,800
You won because I wasn't in the competition.

82
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,970
Come look at the Ranking List.

83
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:56,340
As long as a player can be
the top of the Ranking List,

84
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:59,450
his ID's profile image will be saved
as an NPC automatically.

85
00:04:59,450 --> 00:05:02,040
If someone surpasses me,
my profile image will be deleted.

86
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,360
Mine is still there.

87
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,440
No one has surpassed me yet.

88
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,920
Watch me defeat you in this round!

89
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:09,220
Get on! One more round!

90
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:13,421
 

91
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:27,220
 ♫ But you try your best
not leaving regrets for me ♫ 

92
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:37,580
 ♫ You are like my private investigator ♫ 

93
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:42,600
 ♫ You see through every action and expression ♫ 

94
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:46,240
 

95
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:54,580
 ♫ You are my dearest in my heart ♫ 

96
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:59,260
 

97
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:03,790
 ♫ I will care about you forever ♫ 

98
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:08,211
 

99
00:06:08,211 --> 00:06:11,171
Fool! You lost again!

100
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:21,020
 ♫ You make every idle moment interesting again ♫ 

101
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:29,440
 ♫ You are my dearest in my heart ♫ 

102
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,530
He didn't want to win.

103
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:34,970
Even though my big brother was an NPC,

104
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:38,720
he wanted to stay
with a big brother like this for longer...

105
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:42,600
and much longer...

106
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:48,040
 ♫ Let us stay together ♫ 

107
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:17,120
Why are you doing this?

108
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,080
Fine.

109
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,800
You won't eat anything? I'll throw all food away.

110
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,300
We'll eat, okay?

111
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:28,020
It's just breakfast.

112
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:30,880
Everyone, start eating! Start eating.

113
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,420
Pass me the bread, please.

114
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:42,560
If you could turn to others in competitions,
it'd be great.

115
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:47,910
Wait... Where is Wu Chen? Has anyone seen him?

116
00:07:47,910 --> 00:07:50,250
Since the competition ended that day...

117
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:52,840
I have never seen him again.

118
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,660
I knew it was him.

119
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:56,480
We were right not to let him compete.

120
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:59,160
He might manage to climb
the social ladder in Zhu Xian.

121
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,890
Don't say that, Lao Wei.

122
00:08:00,890 --> 00:08:04,300
How can we blame Wu Chen
for being defeated by Zhu Xian?

123
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:06,440
What I said is all true.

124
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:10,230
I myself saw him with Zhu Xian
players before the competition.

125
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:12,380
Who would know if it was him who ratted us out?

126
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:14,000
He told them Lao Ye was not there.

127
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,070
Are you sure it was Wu Chen?

128
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:19,960
Didn't someone blunder because
the mouse slipped out of his hand?

129
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:22,100
Besides... Let me ask you...

130
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:24,380
What's wrong with your hand?

131
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:27,280
Now what?

132
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,980
Don't make that face.

133
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:30,710
Nobody owes you anything.

134
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:34,910
"Listen to my command and we'll win for sure"?

135
00:08:34,910 --> 00:08:35,860
Listen!

136
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:39,020
What I hate most is someone
gets above himself with his sciolism!

137
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:40,790
If you are really capable, win to prove yourself!

138
00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:42,760
- Xiao An! 
 - Stop it!

139
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:45,180
The best commander needs a good cooperation.

140
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:46,900
Go practice and improve yourself!

141
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:48,420
Cooperation?

142
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:53,440
Who was the one that went to the
front and disrupted the entire plan?

143
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,340
Was that me? Never!

144
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:56,700
Why did I go to the front?

145
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:58,880
There was no main attacker at all!

146
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:01,400
Don't look at me.

147
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,060
We need to adjust our paces when attacking!

148
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:05,400
You think you are the best and
everyone else is holding you back?

149
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,940
But each time I do the post-game analysis,

150
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:09,200
I see you disrupt our paces
by taking your own course.

151
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:13,120
Enough. We are a team. Could everyone just calm down?

152
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:16,780
Yi Fan. When would you know your own mind?

153
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:18,680
He doesn't need to.

154
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:21,180
"Yes Man" never needs to
take responsibilities for anyone!

155
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:23,060
Everyone should take
responsibilities for the competition.

156
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:25,270
It doesn't make any sense to
say all this when we are angry.

157
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:27,460
Why are you here validating your existence?

158
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:28,620
Have you got any score?

159
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:32,200
Why don't you make a "Losers'
Team" with Luo Ji? Perfect for you!

160
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,120
Are you done?

161
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:36,910
You won't let it go?

162
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:38,860
No!

163
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:42,830
We are not born to build a team together!

164
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:44,640
Fine.  Let's part our ways.

165
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,500
- Do it! 
 - Now!

166
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:49,720
Whatever. I don't even like it here.

167
00:09:55,550 --> 00:09:57,140
Captain.

168
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:03,990
It's everyone's Xing Xin.

169
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:08,590
You should make your own decisions.

170
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:33,450
 

171
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:15,370
 

172
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:17,500
Through the whole journey...
 

173
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:20,470
Highly intense daily training and
the pressure from preparations

174
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:22,740
have been irritating all of us.

175
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:26,620
Occasional fragility and outburst...

176
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:28,680
speak for the truest us.

177
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:33,360
I think... we all need more time... 
 

178
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,720
to learn from experience... to learn about responsibility...

179
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,690
and to learn how to grow up.

180
00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:42,520
This time... I won't...

181
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:46,940
and I don't want to... make any decisions for you.

182
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,460
Tang.

183
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:00,340
Let's go.

184
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:25,820
Look at me!

185
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:27,330
See my APM?

186
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:29,230
As fast as before!

187
00:12:29,830 --> 00:12:31,090
Look at my position.

188
00:12:31,090 --> 00:12:32,740
As fancy as before!

189
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:34,510
See my reaction?

190
00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:37,100
Lao Wei, any new word?

191
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:39,740
Stop it! Look at you.

192
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:41,980
Only can show off when doing PVE.

193
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:45,400
You'll absolutely be defeated by
new talents in real competitions.

194
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:47,280
We retired 5 or 6 years ago.

195
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:48,960
You're not like us. You just
made your reappearance.

196
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,460
We'd never be the ones
they wanted to rival against.

197
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:51,920
Don't even mention real competitions.

198
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:55,540
I'm afraid a boss would be a disaster for you.

199
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:57,780
Wait!

200
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,340
Are you provoking us?

201
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:02,420
Lao Wei, don't look down on us.

202
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:03,630
Let's show him.

203
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:06,400
I won't go home if I can't defeat several bosses.

204
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:09,280
- Seriously? 
 - Stay focused!

205
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:20,880
Good job!

206
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:25,280
Hello.

207
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:29,700
Honey... Yes, I bought it.

208
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:31,740
I'm on my way home.

209
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:33,700
Met a traffic jam.

210
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:38,240
There is no keyboard sound. You got it wrong.

211
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:41,380
No keyboard at all on the road.

212
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:42,740
Okay, I see.

213
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:44,400
Seriously?

214
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:47,420
- Come and fill! 
 - I'm coming. Let's continue.

215
00:13:48,450 --> 00:13:50,080
Lao Wei.

216
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:52,760
Let's poke?

217
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:15,660
Hello. What?

218
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:17,920
It didn't work by increasing 2%?

219
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,700
Okay. Wait for me.

220
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:22,950
No need. The driver is downstairs.

221
00:14:24,650 --> 00:14:26,180
Lao Wei. Let's take a rain check.

222
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:27,940
Something came up in the company. I gotta go.

223
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:29,320
See you.

224
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:31,900
What the heck?

225
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:33,810
Next time I'll take all your
phones away when you come!

226
00:14:33,810 --> 00:14:35,500
Exactly!

227
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:36,820
Lao Wu, you are my good buddy.

228
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:39,050
Only you and I can also beat the boss.

229
00:14:57,510 --> 00:14:58,880
Hello.

230
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,720
I'll be right there. I promise.

231
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:03,820
Well... Lao Wei. I'm sorry.

232
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:05,050
My driving buddies are rushing me.

233
00:15:05,050 --> 00:15:06,340
We'll make a self-driving tour to Tibet.

234
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:09,520
I thought I could play some games before leaving.

235
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:12,100
Next time. I'll have a blast with you.

236
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:13,740
I give you my word.

237
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:26,830
Why is it so difficult to find
someone to play Glory with?

238
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,420
Lao Wei.

239
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:36,940
You played Glory.

240
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:38,660
And you went through a lot.

241
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:39,960
It's time to let go.

242
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:41,930
Think about your future.

243
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,780
You are the same.

244
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:47,810
You can let anything go but Glory.

245
00:15:47,810 --> 00:15:49,760
Or you wouldn't come back.

246
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:51,360
I...

247
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:55,440
I came back for the baby
diapers I bought for my kid.

248
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:01,110
Bye!

249
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:27,100
Driver, stop here, please.

250
00:17:05,950 --> 00:17:08,450
Pay attention to the rhythms
when you play this part.

251
00:17:08,450 --> 00:17:10,140
Okay.

252
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:13,220
Stop.

253
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:15,180
Tang Rou.

254
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:16,660
Let me introduce her.

255
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:18,270
This is your senior.

256
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:19,860
She is my most excellent student.

257
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:21,460
Come here.

258
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:25,040
- Long time no see. 
 - Long time no see.

259
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:30,560
I chose to escape from here before.

260
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:34,820
But I won't do it again.

261
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:39,330
If you decide not to escape again,

262
00:17:39,330 --> 00:17:41,720
would you come back?

263
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,490
Think about it.

264
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:55,340
Because of a mistake I made in the competition,

265
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:57,900
I have never played the piano again.

266
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:06,760
The old me...

267
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:13,160
thought winning the competition... was my entire life.

268
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:16,960
But the new me...

269
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:19,950
is not afraid of losing anymore.

270
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:22,960
I won't escape, either.

271
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:35,200
Because my passion... triumphs over winning or losing.

272
00:18:42,130 --> 00:18:44,940
What makes me understand all this...

273
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:46,740
is Glory.

274
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:50,970
The price... is listed very clearly.

275
00:18:50,970 --> 00:18:52,910
If you make up your mind...

276
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:55,630
sign here.

277
00:18:59,710 --> 00:19:02,210
 

278
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:08,320
Boss Wei! You forgot to take the
medicine for your hand injury.

279
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,260
I've brought it here.

280
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:15,080
 

281
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:18,520
You're selling your account?

282
00:19:21,430 --> 00:19:23,690
Wand of Death is even
more precious than your life.

283
00:19:23,690 --> 00:19:24,880
Are you really selling it?

284
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,660
I don't want it anymore.

285
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:28,970
Don't sign it!

286
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:33,700
Get out!

287
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:35,480
Go!

288
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:37,060
Go!

289
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:41,460
Are you really leaving Glory?

290
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:46,830
Or what?

291
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:49,260
I couldn't even call up my friends together.

292
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:52,400
Where could I play Glory?

293
00:20:02,650 --> 00:20:04,570
Return to Xing Xin with me.

294
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:05,700
Like our old days.

295
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:07,940
We screwed things up when
rivaling against Zhu Xian.

296
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:09,700
Do you think we...

297
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:11,980
No...

298
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:15,920
Do you think I... should continue working on it?

299
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,850
Some battles you win, some battles you lose.

300
00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:20,560
Moreover, it was not your own
responsibility in that competition.

301
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:23,340
I'm not like any of you.

302
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:29,700
I should live like others who are in my age.

303
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:32,860
What's your age?

304
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:33,840
In my eyes...

305
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:36,690
You are in the exact age when
you should strive, hang out, and play Glory with us all!

306
00:20:36,690 --> 00:20:38,600
Look at it!

307
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:43,210
It is the injury that decides I need to leave now.

308
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:50,660
Our captain has said...

309
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:53,660
Only you can make the decision...

310
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:55,840
when you should leave the competition.

311
00:20:56,660 --> 00:21:02,180
No matter if you are at your peak, or in your trough, or you're kicked out...

312
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:05,420
As long as you love Glory,

313
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:07,370
as long as you want to be in this arena,

314
00:21:07,370 --> 00:21:09,560
you'll find a way to handle
all your setbacks and failures.

315
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:12,740
It's a choice that we eSports players must face!

316
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:22,840
No matter how many times we start over...

317
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:25,480
we'll never change.

318
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:41,210
Sign it.

319
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:46,320
Wait a sec.

320
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,380
I've got another pen here.

321
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:50,840
Hurry up and sign it.

322
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:56,080
 

323
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,740
 

324
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,780
Sir, we're about to close.

325
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:24,880
Sorry. I...

326
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:30,990
Thank you.

327
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:34,780
Why have you been sitting here?

328
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:38,120
I like this intersection.

329
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,320
What about the intersection?

330
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:43,270
Anything special?

331
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:47,590
If any of them comes back,
I can see them from here.

332
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,400
So?

333
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:51,100
So I can hear the captain say:

334
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:54,080
"All team players of Xing Xin are here!"

335
00:22:56,940 --> 00:23:01,080
What if... they would never come back?

336
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:05,160
They will.

337
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,760
I'm afraid we have to...

338
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,860
wait for the red light
to go off for too long...

339
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:15,940
and the green light just flashes away.

340
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:20,300
The red light will be on for a long time.

341
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:22,360
But it's okay.

342
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:24,570
I'll wait longer.

343
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:55,260
 

344
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:21,240
I've fixed the umbrella.

345
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:26,760
But...

346
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:30,120
I feel something is still wrong.

347
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:36,470
New rubber bands. New hair pins. New cloth.

348
00:24:36,470 --> 00:24:39,900
The material is updated. The quality is much better.

349
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:42,810
I think the umbrella is pretty good.

350
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:49,420
No matter how good it is... It's not the one I used to have.

351
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:52,710
I thought...

352
00:24:52,710 --> 00:24:56,500
I'd get to the end with a thousand-machine
umbrella by being Jun Mo Xiao.

353
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:06,120
But I didn't make it.

354
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:17,760
Remember this coin?

355
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:26,710
If it had not been for it,

356
00:25:26,710 --> 00:25:29,360
Your big brother would have never taken me in.

357
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:33,550
If it had not been for it, you would have never met me.

358
00:25:36,230 --> 00:25:38,860
Back then, my parents were gone.

359
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:41,240
My relatives living abroad wanted to adopt me.

360
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:44,380
Should we still stick together like before?

361
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:47,340
Or should he let me leave for a promising future?

362
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:49,210
My big brother hesitated.

363
00:25:49,210 --> 00:25:50,660
Head, let her go.

364
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:52,500
Tail, let her stay.

365
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:18,790
Because of you... our fate has been changed.

366
00:26:18,790 --> 00:26:22,600
You always say you were lucky to meet us.

367
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:24,480
But your appearance...

368
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:28,580
was the best luck the lucky coin brought to us.

369
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:34,180
Your big brother never wanted to let you go.

370
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:36,870
I was just passing by inadvertently.

371
00:26:36,870 --> 00:26:42,260
And then inadvertently... helped him make a decision
that had been in his mind.

372
00:26:43,790 --> 00:26:49,820
But you always inadvertently helped us... to have the best choices.

373
00:26:53,160 --> 00:27:00,300
 ♫ But you try your best
not leaving regrets for me ♫ 

374
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:04,100
Why are you quitting the part-time job here?

375
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,600
I'm looking for a full-time job...

376
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:09,910
which will help me make money... and feed my family.

377
00:27:09,910 --> 00:27:11,190
But...

378
00:27:11,190 --> 00:27:13,720
What about the senior seminar of programming?

379
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:15,860
I quit.

380
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:24,460
Su Mu Qiu. Are you really doing this?

381
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:28,860
To be a miserable brother
quitting school for his little sister?

382
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:31,780
Since I've decided to stick with Mu Cheng,

383
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:35,230
I'll try whatever I can to give her a better life.

384
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:38,080
What is "better life"?

385
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:42,380
Mu Cheng's birthday wish
was to go to the Sea World.

386
00:27:44,290 --> 00:27:47,740
But what I can afford now is three golden fishes.

387
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:54,480
 ♫ I will care about you forever ♫ 

388
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:57,040
Who said three little golden fishes...

389
00:27:57,040 --> 00:28:00,080
would never have their own Sea World?

390
00:28:04,050 --> 00:28:08,460
The three of us... were like these three golden fishes.

391
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:10,790
We didn't have a big house.

392
00:28:10,790 --> 00:28:12,520
We didn't have fancy decorations.

393
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:14,620
But we were still happy.

394
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:17,120
This was "better life".

395
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:22,410
Thank you. You gave me the best birthday gift ever.

396
00:28:22,410 --> 00:28:24,220
Thank you.

397
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:27,380
For being the best birthday gift ever... in my and my brother's life.

398
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:35,630
 ♫ You are like my private investigator ♫ 

399
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:39,980
We'll have many crossings in life.

400
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:43,920
If we were not careful enough... we'd derail.

401
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:48,860
What I only did was to tell your brother...

402
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:51,460
to go along one road.

403
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:55,680
There's nothing wrong with going along one road.

404
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:59,280
That was how exactly... I met all of you.

405
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:02,020
And my brother could go back to school.

406
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:06,170
In the end... A thousand-machine umbrella was born.

407
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:10,680
I got it! I got it!

408
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:13,210
Look! How about this design?

409
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:17,700
Awesome!

410
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:21,120
We made it!

411
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:26,080
But it belongs to me now.

412
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:28,100
It's mine!

413
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:29,701
- Come back! 
 - I said "it's mine"!

414
00:29:29,701 --> 00:29:31,110
I said it!

415
00:29:31,110 --> 00:29:35,290
Everyone said... A thousand-machine umbrella
was an unpractical fantasy.

416
00:29:35,290 --> 00:29:38,050
And it was a mission that
would never be accomplished.

417
00:29:38,050 --> 00:29:39,540
But you said...

418
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:42,990
The difference between fantasy
and reality was whether you believe it.

419
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:47,080
And the way to make the
impossible possible was never give up.

420
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:52,100
So, a thousand-machine umbrella... has never only belonged to my brother.

421
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:56,360
You used to help him a lot.

422
00:29:57,020 --> 00:30:01,960
So now... Let him help you make a decision.

423
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:03,900
Tell us...

424
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:06,780
what we should do.

425
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:11,850
No need to look.

426
00:30:12,550 --> 00:30:14,820
I know what Mu Qiu would say.

427
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:22,280
"No big deal. Start over."

428
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:30,021
Ta Yun and Xing Xin have equal points.

429
00:30:30,021 --> 00:30:32,260
But with the win-lose situation,
Xing Xin has made their way to the final.

430
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:33,460
- Manager Chen, what's your opinion?
- Talk to us.

431
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:35,370
- Could we have the conversation upstairs? 
 - Okay, okay.

432
00:30:35,370 --> 00:30:36,880
Share details with us later, please.

433
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:39,590
Okay. Come in, please.

434
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:44,400
We all know when rivaling against Zhu Xian,

435
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:46,570
there was something wrong
with Captain Ye's ultimate weapon.

436
00:30:46,570 --> 00:30:48,800
Will he show up in the final and compete?

437
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:51,400
All players are trying to fix it now.

438
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:54,980
Moreover, you care about competitions
more than equipment displays.

439
00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:58,970
Has your players been affected
by the failure from last time?

440
00:31:00,030 --> 00:31:03,110
Captain Ye has said: "Some battles you win, some battles you lose."

441
00:31:03,110 --> 00:31:05,140
Everyone is very active now.

442
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:06,640
We are actively preparing for the competition.

443
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:08,180
But according to our informant,

444
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:11,710
Wei Chen has sold his account and
his silver equipment "Wand of Death".

445
00:31:11,710 --> 00:31:12,980
How would you explain it?

446
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:16,380
We heard Tang Rou returned to her
band and Wu Chen was in Zhu Xian.

447
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:19,160
And your other players are not with Xing Xin.

448
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:23,130
So, with everyone's leaving, will Xing Xin be dissolved?

449
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:28,840
I've told you.

450
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:32,000
Everyone is trying to fix a
thousand-machine umbrella actively.

451
00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:34,660
Captain Ye has sent them to buy materials.

452
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:36,780
That's why they are not with Xing Xin now.

453
00:31:36,780 --> 00:31:38,900
Could we call them from here?

454
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:40,550
We care about what's really going on.

455
00:31:40,550 --> 00:31:41,700
Yes, call them.

456
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:43,770
Prove it by calling them.

457
00:31:43,770 --> 00:31:46,380
Seems Xing Xin is just an
empty shell. No one is here.

458
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:48,380
Who said that?

459
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:57,020
Boss. I've got all the materials
you and Captain Ye needed.

460
00:31:57,020 --> 00:31:59,320
Things are going well with Yi Fan and others.

461
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:01,180
They'll be back soon.

462
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:06,000
It's the contract of purchasing materials.

463
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,280
All data are in here.

464
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:11,060
You wanna prove something?

465
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:14,261
Go ahead. 
  

466
00:32:14,261 --> 00:32:18,800
 

467
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:20,260
Contact us if there's any further info.

468
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:22,071
- Remember it. 
 - Keep in touch with us.

469
00:32:22,071 --> 00:32:23,100
We will.

470
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:25,380
- Bye!
- Bye!

471
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:37,140
So you met with Zhu Xian players to buy materials?

472
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:40,220
Yes. Xing Xin didn't have enough silver equipment.

473
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:42,580
I wanted to surprise all of you.

474
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:46,420
Why didn't you tell us back then?

475
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:49,780
We'll listen to the chief
commander no matter what happens.

476
00:32:50,610 --> 00:32:52,400
Keeping you all on an even keel...

477
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:54,760
is more important than
whether I was in the competition.

478
00:32:56,260 --> 00:32:58,340
Where did you go after the competition?

479
00:32:58,340 --> 00:33:00,180
To save a thousand-machine umbrella.

480
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:02,620
The final was coming. Time was running out.

481
00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:05,460
I visited many teams and guilds in a short time.

482
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:07,600
And I've got a batch of basic materials.

483
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,810
Hope they will help the captain.

484
00:33:39,490 --> 00:33:41,500
Do you think if they would come back?

485
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:42,930
Boss.

486
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:47,060
All professional players will
face the life crossing of choices.

487
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:48,960
I've made my choice.

488
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:52,420
It's their turn now.

489
00:33:54,220 --> 00:33:56,020
What we can do now...

490
00:33:56,020 --> 00:33:58,500
is to give them more space...

491
00:33:59,150 --> 00:34:01,490
and give the captain more time.

492
