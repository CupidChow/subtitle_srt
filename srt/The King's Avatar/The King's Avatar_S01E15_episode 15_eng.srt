 "Light From the Ashes" - Cai Weize 

2
00:00:02,350 --> 00:00:06,220
♫  Countless fireflies born from insignificance  ♫

3
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:10,090
♫  Riding the long wind to gather into a shining galaxy  ♫

4
00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:13,960
♫  Proclaim to the world on top of the sky  ♫

5
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:18,800
♫  We will return in glory  ♫

6
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:23,770
♫  Clear the clouds and descend with the heat  ♫

7
00:00:23,770 --> 00:00:27,440
♫  Melting ice and snow, overcoming twists and turns  ♫

8
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:31,250
♫  Finally at this moment of peak  ♫

9
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:35,370
♫  There is a figure that coincides with the past  ♫

10
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:39,100
♫  The glory of the past that never came  ♫

11
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:42,720
♫  The pride that the future will never pass  ♫

12
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:46,560
♫  Our fingertips intertwined and condensed  ♫

13
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:50,460
♫  Into a song that ignited the battlefield  ♫

14
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:54,230
♫  The only light in an endless night  ♫

15
00:00:54,230 --> 00:00:58,000
♫  Is you and me who overcame mediocrity  ♫

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,010
♫  Up on the clouds and down in the dust  ♫

17
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:05,810
♫  Fireflies making every effort to illuminate  ♫

18
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:09,580
♫  I came from the legend to carry on a legend  ♫

19
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:13,510
♫  Once it's disruptive, a decade of persistence won't be in vain  ♫

20
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:17,320
♫  Up on the clouds and down in the dust  ♫

21
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:21,170
♫  Fireflies making every effort to illuminate  ♫

22
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:24,940
♫  Fireflies making every effort to illuminate  ♫

23
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:28,160
   

24
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:32,660
   

25
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:38,314
   

26
00:01:38,314 --> 00:01:39,871
What are you looking for?

27
00:01:39,871 --> 00:01:45,660
If I can't prevent others from coming in, I need to make changes inside.

28
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:50,500
Tell me. How many locks should I put on the attic?

29
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:53,900
What? Locks?

30
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:59,380
Or I could demolish the stairs to the attic.

31
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:01,000
After all, he stays indoors.

32
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,900
There shouldn't be any problem if he stays up there for over 10 days.

33
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:04,420
Wait, Guo Guo.

34
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:07,340
What you are saying is so weird.

35
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:12,200
I will give him a computer.

36
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:15,580
After all, as long as he has Glory in his world, he'll be fine.

37
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:19,280
As long as he doesn't expose himself, the journalists won't know.

38
00:02:20,131 --> 00:02:21,557
Perfect.

39
00:02:21,557 --> 00:02:22,945
How is it perfect?

40
00:02:22,945 --> 00:02:26,760
Even if journalists won't come, the police will.

41
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:30,400
Nothing will work. What should I do?

42
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,400
I'm running out of options.

43
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:38,300
Guo Guo, it's quite simple if you really want to keep him here.

44
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:40,400
Then what should I do?

45
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,000
Should I break his legs?

46
00:02:49,677 --> 00:02:51,674
That's not impossible.

47
00:02:51,674 --> 00:02:54,468
- As long as he has his hands.  
 - Of course not!

48
00:02:54,468 --> 00:02:57,540
What nonsense are you thinking about right now?

49
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:01,500
I mean, if you want to keep someone from leaving,

50
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:05,200
win his heart first.

51
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,000
How?

52
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,500
Two words.

53
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:13,733
Spoil him.

54
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:19,970
Spoil him?

55
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:25,850
   

56
00:03:36,106 --> 00:03:38,193
That's strange.

57
00:03:38,193 --> 00:03:40,546
Why hasn't anybody called me?

58
00:04:02,726 --> 00:04:06,113
Even though this plan is a little old-fashioned,

59
00:04:06,113 --> 00:04:08,960
he is a man after all.

60
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:12,600
It should work.

61
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:20,700
Xiao Chu, he's coming.

62
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:22,400
Brother Ye.

63
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:25,813
You're up.

64
00:04:25,813 --> 00:04:27,900
Why aren't you using the vacuum cleaner?

65
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:30,300
My boss said the vacuum cleaner is too noisy.

66
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:32,380
It might disturb you.

67
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:34,973
Oh, by the way,

68
00:04:34,973 --> 00:04:37,780
your breakfast is ready.

69
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:40,286
Eat it while it is warm. It won't taste good if it gets cold.

70
00:04:40,286 --> 00:04:42,153
- What's going on? 
 - This way. This way.

71
00:04:42,153 --> 00:04:44,040
Over here. Here.

72
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:48,230
Da-da-da-da.

73
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:54,860
From this one to that one, they were all prepared for you.

74
00:04:58,413 --> 00:05:01,653
- What's this? 
 - Explain it to him.

75
00:05:01,653 --> 00:05:05,486
There are ten kinds of nutritious porridge.

76
00:05:05,486 --> 00:05:07,340
Including Eight-Ingredient Porridge,

77
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:08,780
porridge with white fungus and lotus seeds,

78
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:11,720
and porridge with red beans and corn.

79
00:05:13,746 --> 00:05:16,600
They were all prepared by the boss.

80
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,600
Of course.

81
00:05:20,433 --> 00:05:23,800
- What should I do now? 
 - There is also salty porridge.

82
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:27,340
Well, Brother Ye, you don't like sweet porridge, do you?

83
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:29,880
There is also salty porridge here, like porridge with corn and spareribs.

84
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:33,470
- And there's shrimp meat... 
 - Stop. That's enough.

85
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:40,500
I understand what you're thinking.

86
00:05:43,213 --> 00:05:45,160
Really?

87
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:49,286
She wants to use these carbohydrates so I'll die from overeating.

88
00:05:49,286 --> 00:05:52,886
That way, she can inherit my Glory equipment, right? I see.

89
00:05:52,886 --> 00:05:54,800
- I won't be fooled. 
 - No.

90
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,200
The package!

91
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,366
Brother Ye, your package...

92
00:05:58,366 --> 00:06:00,373
Your package arrived.

93
00:06:00,373 --> 00:06:02,600
What else?

94
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,900
 Hello. Here's your package. 

95
00:06:06,486 --> 00:06:09,420
It's so hard to please him.

96
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,400
- What's this? 
 - This is...

97
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:18,000
This is a coffee maker that the boss bought for you.

98
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,400
In the morning, it can grind coffee beans for you.

99
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,813
At night, it can make cold brew coffee.

100
00:06:24,813 --> 00:06:26,786
Whatever flavor you like.

101
00:06:26,786 --> 00:06:28,520
Please sign here.

102
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:32,646
Suning delivers parcels so fast.

103
00:06:32,646 --> 00:06:34,900
She thinks I don't stay up late enough.

104
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:37,500
She wants me to work overtime every day.

105
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:41,500
Sir, if you don't like it, it's refundable within 30 days.

106
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:43,186
- Really? 
 - No.

107
00:06:43,186 --> 00:06:46,100
Go, go.

108
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:50,146
- Boss. 
 - Wow, so many porridges.

109
00:06:50,146 --> 00:06:52,800
What a pity that they weren't prepared for me.

110
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,800
If they were prepared for me, I would have to thank that person kindly.

111
00:06:58,306 --> 00:06:59,800
Why are you looking at me?

112
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,100
I love drinking juice.

113
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:04,740
But no one buys me a juicer.

114
00:07:05,886 --> 00:07:08,480
You should appreciate what you get.

115
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:18,400
Is there something wrong with this computer?

116
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,100
This...

117
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:36,520
Where are you going?

118
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,700
Don't. Let me do it.

119
00:07:52,946 --> 00:07:54,740
You're such an idiot...

120
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:03,093
Why bother doing such menial work?

121
00:08:03,093 --> 00:08:05,346
I'll do it. I'll do it.

122
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:10,300
Boss, what's wrong with you today?

123
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:24,700
Don't you think I am

124
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:29,420
kinder to you today than before?

125
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,920
No.

126
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:49,400
Fine. Fine.

127
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,280
Fine.

128
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:53,760
Starting today,

129
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,846
you don't have to manage the internet cafe.

130
00:08:55,846 --> 00:08:59,400
You can play Glory whenever you want. I will still pay you.

131
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,380
How about that?

132
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,100
I think it's a trap.

133
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:08,400
It's not a trap.

134
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:15,760
It's just my sincerity.

135
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:18,800
Why don't I make some coffee for you?

136
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,293
Here.

137
00:09:21,173 --> 00:09:23,200
Be careful. It's hot.

138
00:09:25,333 --> 00:09:27,666
I don't want a blend of Robusta.

139
00:09:27,666 --> 00:09:30,100
I want freshly roasted Arabica beans.

140
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:31,800
Or at least,

141
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,400
those beans from Liberia.

142
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:39,800
Do you have that?

143
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,900
I'll go ask Xiao Chu to buy them.

144
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:46,600
So you don't have it?

145
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:53,000
How about drinking some tea?

146
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,360
I have red tea, green tea, white tea...

147
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:58,100
Whatever tea you want.

148
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:00,700
Which one do you want.

149
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,813
Flower tea.

150
00:10:08,006 --> 00:10:10,140
I will go ask Xiao Chu to buy that, too.

151
00:10:14,433 --> 00:10:16,100
Never mind.

152
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:18,300
No coffee. No tea.

153
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:21,460
Then give me a fruit tray.

154
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,980
Okay.

155
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:29,100
Here you are.

156
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:35,800
Boss, are you kidding me?

157
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,700
What's wrong?

158
00:10:41,833 --> 00:10:44,020
Do you know how to peel an apple?

159
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:45,886
Didn't I peel it?

160
00:10:45,886 --> 00:10:47,760
You try it.

161
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
You call this peeling apples?

162
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:55,000
I need something artistic.

163
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,940
This is too ugly. I won't eat it.

164
00:11:00,746 --> 00:11:03,046
Artistic?

165
00:11:03,046 --> 00:11:04,606
It's ready.

166
00:11:07,933 --> 00:11:09,513
You are quite deft.

167
00:11:09,513 --> 00:11:12,700
This rabbit is delicate.

168
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:18,440
Right? I am telling you... It's quite difficult to carve a rabbit.

169
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:23,220
Look at its ears. They will break if you are not careful enough.

170
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:33,860
It doesn't taste well. I won't eat it.

171
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,460
You are such a bra...

172
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,180
Brat.

173
00:11:41,426 --> 00:11:43,333
Say that again.

174
00:11:44,953 --> 00:11:46,393
Brat.

175
00:11:46,393 --> 00:11:51,206
Brat! Don't think that I'm being kind to you so you can push me around.

176
00:11:53,226 --> 00:11:55,666
Boss, keep it up.

177
00:11:55,666 --> 00:11:58,280
Just speak your mind and be your true self.

178
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:01,146
Otherwise, I have to put on an act for you every day.

179
00:12:01,146 --> 00:12:03,200
It's exhausting.

180
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:07,286
Put on an act?

181
00:12:07,286 --> 00:12:09,826
Yes. If you have to be a fan,

182
00:12:09,826 --> 00:12:13,080
then I have to suffer and act like an idol.

183
00:12:20,473 --> 00:12:23,980
I regard you as my idol, but you treat me like a monkey?

184
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:30,520
Fine. You want to treat me like a monkey?

185
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:32,353
- Don't you? 
 - Boss...

186
00:12:32,353 --> 00:12:34,626
I just told you to speak your mind. Not beat me whenever you want.

187
00:12:34,626 --> 00:12:38,020
I'm beating you now. So what? I...

188
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:43,606
You are so fierce. Are you afraid I will leave?

189
00:12:44,726 --> 00:12:46,373
Fine.

190
00:12:50,646 --> 00:12:52,766
Don't come back if you leave.

191
00:12:54,646 --> 00:12:56,526
I wouldn't dare leave.

192
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:13,500
Hello.

193
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:17,320
 It's me. Why don't we meet? 

194
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:25,480
   

195
00:13:28,333 --> 00:13:29,860
 For so many years, 

196
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:32,746
 I was always a novice in Glory. 

197
00:13:32,746 --> 00:13:37,860
 When I first met Su Muqiu and Ye Qiu, they were the experts in Glory. 

198
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:40,973
 As for me, I was just a loser, 

199
00:13:40,973 --> 00:13:44,670
 who couldn't do anything well. 

200
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:46,260
   

201
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:02,226
 The jungle. The boss appeared in the jungle. 

202
00:14:02,226 --> 00:14:04,853
 Position 234, 665. Come here right now. 

203
00:14:04,853 --> 00:14:06,846
 I'm coming. 

204
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:09,226
 Manager, check out. 

205
00:14:10,133 --> 00:14:13,526
 Your timing doesn't seem right. The time went too fast. 

206
00:14:32,006 --> 00:14:34,426
 So the timing has been tampered with. 

207
00:14:34,426 --> 00:14:36,413
 Give me the account book. 

208
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:44,693
 Boss, what's this for? 

209
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:49,093
 It's for timing. A good thing. 

210
00:14:49,093 --> 00:14:51,433
 It's to steal the online time of our customers. 

211
00:14:51,433 --> 00:14:53,926
 What a shame. You study business. 

212
00:14:53,926 --> 00:14:56,273
 But you don't know what profit maximization is, do you? 

213
00:14:56,273 --> 00:14:59,320
 But you can't have a conscience and make dirty money. 

214
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:04,200
 The most important quality for a great businessman is honesty. 

215
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:07,586
 What a businessman needs isn't character but brains. 

216
00:15:07,586 --> 00:15:10,558
 If you want to make money, stop talking about morality. 

217
00:15:10,558 --> 00:15:13,471
 "If you want to make money, stop talking about morality." 

218
00:15:13,471 --> 00:15:17,980
 At that moment, what I hated most were those words. 

219
00:15:45,906 --> 00:15:47,600
What's wrong?

220
00:15:50,607 --> 00:15:52,883
I'm going to meet an old friend.

221
00:15:54,804 --> 00:15:57,469
 I believe the competitive spirit we advocate 

222
00:15:57,469 --> 00:16:00,270
 will definitely change some people's understanding 

223
00:16:00,270 --> 00:16:01,880
 of this field in this future. 

224
00:16:01,887 --> 00:16:06,360
 Next, we will give vigorous support to qualified people in this field. 

225
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:10,597
 We will form esports teams as soon as possible. 

226
00:16:10,597 --> 00:16:13,069
   

227
00:16:13,069 --> 00:16:17,013
 Sportsmanship, esports teams. 

228
00:16:17,013 --> 00:16:22,069
 These two strange and familiar phrases thrilled Muqiu and I. 

229
00:16:22,069 --> 00:16:25,070
 We wanted to hold the first Glory League competition, 

230
00:16:25,070 --> 00:16:28,244
 inviting those trans-regional masters to compete together. 

231
00:16:28,244 --> 00:16:31,863
 And change Glory into a real competitive sport. 

232
00:16:32,896 --> 00:16:37,080
 Tao Xuan was fired, undoubtedly because he opposed a dishonest businessman. 

233
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:39,653
 And then he joined us. 

234
00:16:39,653 --> 00:16:43,407
 Our poor 3-man trio only had broken screens and old computer hosts. 

235
00:16:43,407 --> 00:16:48,020
 But we expected to do great things. 

236
00:16:48,513 --> 00:16:50,926
 Xiao Ye, you are the commander-in-chief of the entire strategy. 

237
00:16:50,926 --> 00:16:52,146
 As well as our commando team. 

238
00:16:52,146 --> 00:16:54,687
 You are in charge of arranging the competition schedule. 

239
00:16:54,687 --> 00:16:58,820
 The whole level of this competition depends on you. 

240
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:02,690
 Invite the players here, and defeat them one by one. Easy. 

241
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:05,760
♫  Aim higher and rise above mediocrity  ♫

242
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,735
♫  Push past the limits and conquer the peak  ♫

243
00:17:07,735 --> 00:17:11,641
 With our competitive spirit, in our professional careers, 

244
00:17:11,641 --> 00:17:16,490
 we spent our poorest but most satisfying period of time. 

245
00:17:18,495 --> 00:17:21,750
♫  Remaining steadfast on the pinnacle of greatness  ♫

246
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:24,884
♫  That's when I grasped who I was in the past  ♫

247
00:17:24,884 --> 00:17:27,715
♫  Always trying to be my own hero  ♫

248
00:17:27,715 --> 00:17:34,480
♫  Now, I have seen the legend  ♫

249
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,050
 Wei Chen and Han Wenqing, the strongest players in the second server, 

250
00:17:36,050 --> 00:17:37,655
 came to join the competition. 

251
00:17:37,655 --> 00:17:39,403
 Our old self-built computer finally had to face 

252
00:17:39,403 --> 00:17:43,621
 - the challenges from the masters. 
 - Let me do it. 

253
00:17:43,621 --> 00:17:46,213
 Hello. Hello. Please come in. 

254
00:17:46,213 --> 00:17:47,700
 Ready? 

255
00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:02,875
 Begin! 

256
00:18:12,941 --> 00:18:14,450
 Go around. 

257
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:18,778
 The strongest player in the second server is definitely worthy of his name. 

258
00:18:18,778 --> 00:18:21,136
 Let's decide the winner through one move. How about that? 

259
00:18:21,136 --> 00:18:23,300
 That's exactly what I want. 

260
00:18:30,215 --> 00:18:32,056
 What's happened? 

261
00:18:34,972 --> 00:18:36,232
 Why can't I move? 

262
00:18:36,232 --> 00:18:39,212
 Wait. Give me a minute. I'll handle it. 

263
00:18:39,212 --> 00:18:41,216
 You didn't seize the chance to kill me? 

264
00:18:41,216 --> 00:18:45,300
 This is a competition; it's not a PK fight in the jungle. 

265
00:18:49,076 --> 00:18:50,473
 Okay. It's fixed. 

266
00:18:50,473 --> 00:18:52,230
 There will surely be no more... 

267
00:18:54,863 --> 00:18:57,083
 An unfinished competition. 

268
00:18:57,578 --> 00:18:59,980
 A broken screen. 

269
00:19:00,572 --> 00:19:03,340
 They make up the memories of our youth. 

270
00:19:19,438 --> 00:19:23,550
 Ye Qiu, come and have a seat. 

271
00:19:39,106 --> 00:19:42,552
It's been a long time since I played Glory.

272
00:19:42,552 --> 00:19:44,186
Speak your mind.

273
00:19:51,715 --> 00:19:54,361
Come back. Come back to Excellent Era.

274
00:19:54,361 --> 00:19:56,396
Be a coach.

275
00:19:56,396 --> 00:20:00,861
In fact, the position of coach has always been left open for you.

276
00:20:00,861 --> 00:20:03,752
I never considered giving up on you.

277
00:20:03,752 --> 00:20:05,721
I have no interest in standing outside the arena.

278
00:20:05,721 --> 00:20:07,758
I prefer to stand in the arena.

279
00:20:07,758 --> 00:20:09,672
Being a coach is only temporary.

280
00:20:09,672 --> 00:20:12,700
As long as you retire for one year, you can come back immediately.

281
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:14,066
I've already come back.

282
00:20:14,066 --> 00:20:16,673
In fact, we are all very clear that...

283
00:20:17,536 --> 00:20:21,838
the Pro-League nowadays is quite different from that in the past.

284
00:20:21,838 --> 00:20:27,032
Yes. I admit that tactics and coordination are very important.

285
00:20:27,032 --> 00:20:30,650
However, as for your high-end play... most of the audience

286
00:20:30,650 --> 00:20:33,364
doesn't even understand them.

287
00:20:33,364 --> 00:20:35,240
What do they want to see?

288
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:38,598
They want to see that one person can fight against many players,

289
00:20:38,598 --> 00:20:40,995
or save the desperate situation on his own.

290
00:20:40,995 --> 00:20:45,110
This is what they want to see and hope to see.

291
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:48,798
I go to play games, not just to please the audience.

292
00:20:48,798 --> 00:20:50,484
Your Dragon Raising its Head.

293
00:20:50,484 --> 00:20:52,743
You said it was just for fun.

294
00:20:52,743 --> 00:20:55,960
But all the fans regarded it as your personal representative skill.

295
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,869
Its practical value is limited.

296
00:20:57,869 --> 00:20:59,721
Does it matter? It doesn't matter.

297
00:20:59,721 --> 00:21:01,333
What matters is that it is irreplaceable.

298
00:21:01,333 --> 00:21:03,296
Only you can use it.

299
00:21:03,296 --> 00:21:05,660
Using Dragon Raising its Head is necessary.

300
00:21:06,326 --> 00:21:07,253
It's not for putting on a dazzling display.

301
00:21:07,253 --> 00:21:10,767
But you were very successful in showing it this time.

302
00:21:10,767 --> 00:21:14,370
When you used Dragon Raising its Head in the All-Star game,

303
00:21:14,370 --> 00:21:16,946
it roused the crowd immediately.

304
00:21:16,946 --> 00:21:19,800
I don't believe you have never realized that.

305
00:21:21,807 --> 00:21:26,949
Why not seize the chance and ascend directly to the throne?

306
00:21:26,949 --> 00:21:28,921
You are right.

307
00:21:28,921 --> 00:21:30,150
But that's not what I want.

308
00:21:30,150 --> 00:21:31,696
Then what do you want?

309
00:21:31,696 --> 00:21:33,355
Winning.

310
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:45,975
Do you think you can now

311
00:21:45,975 --> 00:21:50,440
win back the glory that belongs to you?

312
00:21:53,341 --> 00:21:55,010
I'll give it a try.

313
00:21:55,806 --> 00:22:02,990
I... only focus on the future, and I'm never stuck in the past.

314
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:06,456
As for those stumbling blocks to the future of Excellent Era,

315
00:22:08,258 --> 00:22:11,620
I will throw them away without hesitation.

316
00:22:14,775 --> 00:22:16,264
But...

317
00:22:16,955 --> 00:22:18,541
in this regard,

318
00:22:20,793 --> 00:22:22,958
we are the same.

319
00:22:23,856 --> 00:22:26,166
Recently, I have kept wondering...

320
00:22:27,329 --> 00:22:29,660
If Muqiu were still here,

321
00:22:32,923 --> 00:22:36,157
would we have been brought to this point?

322
00:22:38,416 --> 00:22:39,947
 Xiao Ye, 

323
00:22:42,972 --> 00:22:46,049
 from now on, you are the core of our team. 

324
00:22:46,049 --> 00:22:49,184
 The allocation of personnel is all to support you. 

325
00:22:49,184 --> 00:22:51,395
 You can also decide the tactics. 

326
00:22:51,395 --> 00:22:53,298
 I don't worry about your abilities. 

327
00:22:53,298 --> 00:22:56,360
 You will definitely become number 1 in Glory. 

328
00:22:59,709 --> 00:23:01,550
 Muqiu. 

329
00:23:01,550 --> 00:23:03,401
 Here. 

330
00:23:03,401 --> 00:23:05,747
 You are also part of our team. 

331
00:23:05,747 --> 00:23:08,424
 After all, you are the only one who cooperates well with Ye Qiu. 

332
00:23:08,424 --> 00:23:09,752
 But apart from the competitions, 

333
00:23:09,752 --> 00:23:11,950
 you have to offer some technical support. 

334
00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:14,946
 Issues like the design of the equipment are all up to you. 

335
00:23:14,946 --> 00:23:19,583
 They should pose no problem for a genius like you. 

336
00:23:19,583 --> 00:23:22,416
 Brother Tao, you are flattering me. 

337
00:23:22,416 --> 00:23:27,180
 As for me, from now on, I'll handle the odds and ends. 

338
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:29,224
 Leave the logistical support to me. 

339
00:23:29,224 --> 00:23:33,443
 I believe we will definitely become the number 1 team in Glory. 

340
00:23:33,443 --> 00:23:34,807
 Here. 

341
00:23:36,535 --> 00:23:37,900
 Here we go. 

342
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:41,963
 With Glory in your heart, you are invincible. 

343
00:23:44,984 --> 00:23:46,867
Waiter!

344
00:23:46,867 --> 00:23:49,009
Throw these away!

345
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:52,775
All... Throw all of them away?

346
00:23:52,775 --> 00:23:55,660
Including the computer?

347
00:23:59,776 --> 00:24:02,313
It has been broken for a long time, anyway.

348
00:24:03,089 --> 00:24:05,312
What's the use of keeping it?

349
00:24:13,170 --> 00:24:14,715
Wait.

350
00:24:21,063 --> 00:24:23,236
Indeed it has been broken for a long time.

351
00:24:26,258 --> 00:24:28,898
 Look! This is my design. 

352
00:24:28,898 --> 00:24:30,860
 Unspecialized has always existed in Glory. 

353
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:34,064
 But due to the cool-down period from changing weapons and the high load, 

354
00:24:34,064 --> 00:24:37,144
 there are many flaws in the continuity when attacking. 

355
00:24:37,144 --> 00:24:38,240
 We can't connect the low-level skills 

356
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,700
 with different professions perfectly. 

357
00:24:40,703 --> 00:24:42,072
 But look. 

358
00:24:42,072 --> 00:24:43,943
 If there was a weapon like this, 

359
00:24:43,943 --> 00:24:46,569
 it could change its form at any time. 

360
00:24:47,655 --> 00:24:48,560
 What do you think of it? 

361
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:53,469
 Then it could use all the professional skills continually? 

362
00:24:53,469 --> 00:24:55,053
 That's right. 

363
00:24:57,046 --> 00:24:59,413
 I am designing a weapon like this right now. 

364
00:24:59,413 --> 00:25:00,744
 I call it the Myriad Manifestation Umbrella. 

365
00:25:00,744 --> 00:25:02,018
 Great! 

366
00:25:02,018 --> 00:25:03,926
 So you have already thought this through. 

367
00:25:03,926 --> 00:25:05,470
 And you've even been hiding it from me. 

368
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:06,996
 I haven't finished it yet. 

369
00:25:06,996 --> 00:25:09,120
 There are still two forms left. 

370
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:12,296
 These two forms can't switch between each other at random. 

371
00:25:12,296 --> 00:25:13,809
 But when I finish the design 

372
00:25:13,809 --> 00:25:15,735
 and figure out the last two skills, 

373
00:25:15,735 --> 00:25:17,895
 get ready to sweep away the other players 

374
00:25:17,895 --> 00:25:20,003
 and surprise all of Glory. 

375
00:25:48,998 --> 00:25:50,492
 Yes! 

376
00:25:53,895 --> 00:25:55,827
 Xiao Ye. 

377
00:25:55,827 --> 00:25:59,475
 I heard that Muqiu and you are designing a weapon for the Unspecialized. 

378
00:25:59,475 --> 00:26:04,681
 Yes. With this weapon, I can be a true Unspecialized. 

379
00:26:05,913 --> 00:26:12,018
 Wait, no. It should be called The King's Avatar. 

380
00:26:12,018 --> 00:26:14,313
 However, if you don't change your profession, 

381
00:26:14,313 --> 00:26:17,107
 you can only use the skills of the first twenty levels. 

382
00:26:17,107 --> 00:26:18,067
 How can you play that way? 

383
00:26:18,067 --> 00:26:19,040
 I can. 

384
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:20,300
 Brother Tao, look. 

385
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:22,430
 Even if I can only use the weaker skills from the first twenty levels, 

386
00:26:22,430 --> 00:26:26,238
 it can still produce amazing transformations as long as there are enough skills. 

387
00:26:26,238 --> 00:26:27,640
 The potential of the Unspecialized 

388
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:29,949
 is no worse than that of all twenty-four professions. 

389
00:26:29,949 --> 00:26:32,080
 It could be even better. 

390
00:26:32,695 --> 00:26:36,806
 Fine. Forget about the skills issue for now, 

391
00:26:36,806 --> 00:26:38,400
 what about the league? 

392
00:26:39,249 --> 00:26:42,760
 What if the Unspecialized is not allowed to be in the league? 

393
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:45,347
 What if the level of Glory raises its limits? 

394
00:26:45,347 --> 00:26:48,606
 What if it raises its levels to the ninetieth level, to the hundredth level, 

395
00:26:48,606 --> 00:26:51,280
 do you think playing Unspecialized still has value? 

396
00:26:53,333 --> 00:26:59,089
 Brother Tao, in fact, you have been determined not to allow me to be an Unspecialized. 

397
00:26:59,089 --> 00:27:01,932
 Risk. Risk. Risk. 

398
00:27:01,932 --> 00:27:03,550
 It's about risk. 

399
00:27:03,550 --> 00:27:06,461
 I can't ignore the danger of it just for your fun and games. 

400
00:27:06,461 --> 00:27:07,950
 I have always agreed to your requirement 

401
00:27:07,950 --> 00:27:10,320
 of staying low key and not accepting any endorsements. 

402
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:12,621
 Are you going to continue being so headstrong at this point? 

403
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:24,609
 Brother Tao, please trust me. 

404
00:27:24,609 --> 00:27:29,424
 I believe Muqiu and I can resolve all of these problems. 

405
00:27:30,990 --> 00:27:33,126
 Think it over carefully. 

406
00:27:44,603 --> 00:27:46,478
 Persuade Ye Qiu. 

407
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:07,629
   

408
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:13,706
   

409
00:30:32,418 --> 00:30:36,900
 I think this time we had better listen to Brother Tao. 

410
00:30:41,224 --> 00:30:42,813
 Why? 

411
00:30:44,381 --> 00:30:45,963
 My trial failed. 

412
00:30:45,963 --> 00:30:49,113
 I sealed away the Myriad Manifestation Umbrella. 

413
00:30:49,113 --> 00:30:52,098
 Are you kidding me? This is not a joke. 

414
00:30:52,098 --> 00:30:53,747
 Look at what you designed before. 

415
00:30:53,747 --> 00:30:55,807
 Look at the cannon. So gorgeous. 

416
00:30:55,807 --> 00:30:57,223
 And the weapons in the rear. 

417
00:30:57,223 --> 00:30:59,683
 Right? And this one. 

418
00:31:07,335 --> 00:31:08,727
 This... 

419
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:33,264
 Actually, the Unspecialized is not a conventional profession. 

420
00:31:33,264 --> 00:31:35,476
 Its style isn't very stable. 

421
00:31:35,476 --> 00:31:38,201
 Even if we use it very well, 

422
00:31:38,201 --> 00:31:41,136
 after Excellent Era recruits new members, 

423
00:31:41,136 --> 00:31:44,920
 they won't be able to handle such flexible playing styles like we can. 

424
00:31:46,281 --> 00:31:51,013
 That is indeed a problem for team play. 

425
00:31:51,735 --> 00:31:54,627
 In fact, this isn't that important. 

426
00:31:54,627 --> 00:31:57,086
 Most importantly, one day, 

427
00:31:57,086 --> 00:32:01,723
 we can rise to the top of Glory together instead of depending on the weapons. 

428
00:32:01,723 --> 00:32:03,840
 Therefore, whether we use the Myriad Manifestation Umbrella or not, 

429
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:06,775
 whether I fool you or not, it's not important. 

430
00:32:06,775 --> 00:32:08,320
 Isn't that right? 

431
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:11,409
 How about this? 

432
00:32:11,409 --> 00:32:12,760
 Let's make a bet. 

433
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:15,444
 First, we make Excellent Era into the best team. 

434
00:32:15,444 --> 00:32:16,780
 Then the best member at that time 

435
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:18,090
 will have the right to revive the Myriad Manifestation Umbrella.. 

436
00:32:18,093 --> 00:32:20,600
 What do you think? Do you dare make that bet with me? 

437
00:32:33,303 --> 00:32:36,872
 Here. This is a weapon I made especially for you. 

438
00:32:36,872 --> 00:32:40,300
 I call this weapon Evil Annihilation. 

439
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:42,567
 What do you think? Do you like it? 

440
00:32:48,103 --> 00:32:50,981
 Since the Myriad Manifestation Umbrella can't be completed, 

441
00:32:52,676 --> 00:32:56,940
 let evil annihilation accompany you and rise to the top of Glory. 

442
00:33:38,843 --> 00:33:40,556
Su Muqiu,

443
00:33:41,384 --> 00:33:45,864
you did indeed lie to me.

444
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,924
 This is my secret. 

445
00:33:57,924 --> 00:34:01,900
 Xiao Ye, when you find it, 

446
00:34:03,870 --> 00:34:08,100
 Excellent Era and you must have reached the top of Glory. 

447
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:11,130
   

448
00:34:11,130 --> 00:34:13,570
   

449
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:25,143
   

450
00:34:25,143 --> 00:34:26,620
   

451
00:34:35,750 --> 00:34:38,630
   

452
00:34:40,330 --> 00:34:45,680
 My retirement led to many assumptions by the media and fans. 

453
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:47,660
 I hereby certify that... 

454
00:34:48,332 --> 00:34:50,449
 my retirement had nothing to do with other people. 

455
00:34:50,449 --> 00:34:52,578
 It was my personal decision. 

456
00:34:53,573 --> 00:34:57,224
 With Glory in your heart, you are invincible. 

457
00:34:57,950 --> 00:34:59,460
 Ye Qiu. 

458
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:06,312
   

459
00:35:11,452 --> 00:35:14,276
Tell them there's no need for PR at this point.

460
00:35:14,276 --> 00:35:15,810
Okay.

461
00:35:15,810 --> 00:35:17,970
   

462
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:38,349
 The dungeon of the Heavenly Domain Challenge is a sky-high tower. 

463
00:35:38,349 --> 00:35:41,284
 Normally, after the player kills all the monsters, 

464
00:35:41,284 --> 00:35:43,007
 the tower gate will open 

465
00:35:43,007 --> 00:35:45,563
 and send the player to Heavenly Domain. 

466
00:35:45,563 --> 00:35:47,003
 But the Myriad Manifestation Umbrella can't do that. 

467
00:35:47,003 --> 00:35:49,949
 Because the Myriad Manifestation Umbrella still needs to pass one last step. 

468
00:35:49,949 --> 00:35:53,087
 It will be perfected after the player passes the dungeon of the Heavenly Domain. 

469
00:35:53,087 --> 00:35:55,801
 Before that, the Myriad Manifestation Umbrella cannot be attacked 

470
00:35:55,801 --> 00:35:57,592
 by any frost monsters in the dungeon. 

471
00:35:57,592 --> 00:36:00,213
 Otherwise, the umbrella will be torn apart. 

472
00:36:00,213 --> 00:36:02,196
 So, if you want to pass the dungeon of the Heavenly Domain, 

473
00:36:02,196 --> 00:36:04,078
 with the Myriad Manifestation Umbrella, 

474
00:36:04,078 --> 00:36:06,832
 you can only climb from outside the tower. 

475
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:30,180
   

476
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:07,450
   

477
00:37:19,789 --> 00:37:21,529
 Transforming the form of the umbrella into a long sword, 

478
00:37:21,529 --> 00:37:25,780
 you can use the skills of Blademaster, Spellblade, and Berserker. 

479
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:14,590
   

480
00:38:46,070 --> 00:38:47,910
   

481
00:38:52,289 --> 00:38:54,509
 Transforming the form of the umbrella into a rotor, 

482
00:38:54,509 --> 00:38:56,900
 you can use the skill of Mechanic. 

483
00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:17,740
   

484
00:39:21,658 --> 00:39:23,675
 I hope one day, 

485
00:39:23,675 --> 00:39:27,420
 the Myriad Manifestation Umbrella can reach the summit of Glory. 

486
00:40:05,230 --> 00:40:07,380
You have so much free time? Waiting for me here?

487
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:09,149
I am very busy, okay?

488
00:40:09,149 --> 00:40:11,583
Watch this.
