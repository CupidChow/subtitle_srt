♫  Finally at this moment of peak  ♫

9
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:35,330
♫  There is a figure that coincides with the past  ♫

10
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:39,120
♫  The glory of the past that never came  ♫

11
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,670
♫  The pride that the future will never pass  ♫

00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:46,570
♫  Our fingertips intertwined and condensed  ♫

♫  Is you and me who overcame mediocrity  ♫

16
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:01,980
♫  Up on the clouds and down in the dust  ♫

♫  Once it's disruptive, a decade of persistence won't be in vain  ♫

♫  Fireflies making every effort to illuminate  ♫

22

27
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:47,670
 Did you give it your all this time? 

28
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:52,950
 I give it my all in every match. 

29
00:01:57,850 --> 00:02:00,270
 Are you really going to give up like this? 

30
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:04,510
 Giving up does not mean admitting defeat. 

31
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:11,590
 Okay. Don't be a deserter by then. 

32
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:13,710
 Then see you at the All-Star next year! 

33
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:19,130
 Dragon Raising its Head! Dragon Raising its Head! 

34
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:22,110
 Rebound if you hit rock bottom. 

35
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:27,420
 Never say you'll give up. 

36
00:02:34,394 --> 00:02:37,190

00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:38,270

Grandmaster Ye Qiu!

41
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:48,150
- Grandmaster! 
 - Grandmaster Ye Qiu!

42
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:50,880
Where is Grandmaster Ye Qiu?

43
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:51,831
Tell us where Grandmaster Ye Qiu is.

44
00:02:51,831 --> 00:02:53,590
He just...

45
00:02:54,970 --> 00:02:55,870
left.

46
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:57,970
Hurry!

47
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,878
 Every unwilling departure... 

48
00:03:07,878 --> 00:03:11,150
 is for the sake of a glorious return. 

49
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:14,280
   

50
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:23,870
 Ye Qiu is back! 

51
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,810
 Ye Xiu. 

52
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:28,750
 Your name is so similar to the name of our Grandmaster in Glory. 

53
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,860
 Can you help customers upgrade? 

54
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:32,650
 No. 

55
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:34,630
 What the hell do you know? 

56
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:36,410
 Well. 

57
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,910
 I know how to play Glory. 

58
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:44,740
 I'm the one who's been with Ye Qiu in his entire Glory career. 

59
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:47,570
 Since the iteration is a total failure, why insist on doing it? 

60
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:49,760
 Exactly! Why? 

61
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,250
 Ye Qiu is obviously still a top player. Why did you replace him with Sun Xiang? 

62
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:53,350
 Why? 

63
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:54,891
 All right! I'll give you an answer .

64
00:03:54,891 --> 00:04:00,270
 Actually, the reason why Ye Qiu retired and was replaced by Sun Xiang 

65
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:03,600
 was because it was his decision. 

66
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,160
 The cup is a vase now. 

67
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:07,790
 Maybe he's taking a new path to start over. 

68
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:11,130
 Ye Xiu. Ye Qiu. 

69
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:17,480
    
 ♫  In my heart is the most amazing you  ♫

70
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:19,570
He really is Ye Qiu.

71
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:24,100
♫  Some days time just slips away  ♫

72
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:28,550
♫  Other days it seems to stand still  ♫

73
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:36,870
♫  In my heart is the dearest you  ♫

74
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:39,710
He really has come back.

75
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:44,170
Whether he is Ye Xiu or Ye Qiu...

76
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:46,060
Does it really matter?

77
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:53,610
There's no difference whether he has never left or he has come back.

78
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:58,390
The most important thing is that he has always been with you.

79
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:05,570
- Didn't expect Ye Qiu to come back. 
 - He's as good as he was.

80
00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:08,150
- That's a 10-game win streak. 
 - Exactly.

81
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,590
Our nemesis has come back.

82
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:18,210
Then we'll continue the PKs.

83
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:19,870
No one is scared. 
    

84
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:21,730
See you next year.

85
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:27,840
   

86
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,110
Tang.

87
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:30,730
What?

88
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:42,120
   

89
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,450
Guo Guo, what are you doing...

90
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:59,810
I'll throw away everything from the past.

91
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,410
Then walk with the Grandmaster to the peak.

92
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:11,010
Now we'll call ourselves "Lord Grim."

93
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:16,430
Then, how do you plan to go to the peak?

94
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:21,320
Go back to the hotel now.

95
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:24,082
I'll get to know Grandmaster all over again.

96
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:33,190
Why didn't you stay inside to enjoy the cheers longer?

97
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:34,630
It's cold outside.

98
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:36,854
I was worried you might catch a cold.

99
00:06:36,854 --> 00:06:38,830
Who said I was waiting for you?

100
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:43,640
I'm here to see... how you'll thank me for the three tickets.

101
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:46,140
You gave me three tickets as a gift.

102
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:48,270
What do you want in return?

103
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:52,170
Same as usual.

104
00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:56,590
But it's still cold.

105
00:06:56,590 --> 00:06:58,950
Cold weather is the best. I can eat slowly.

106
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:00,958
It won't melt rapidly.

107
00:07:04,810 --> 00:07:05,820
- Hi! 
 - Hi!

108
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:08,678
I'll have this one, this one, and this one.

109
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:21,990
   

110
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:23,630
Boss. 
    

111
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:25,730
One more thing. 
    

112
00:07:32,382 --> 00:07:36,618
   

113
00:07:39,450 --> 00:07:43,260
Wait... Why are you dressed like Brown Bear?

114
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:44,580
The shop employee had to do something.

115
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:46,590
She asked me to help her for a while.

116
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:49,180
A 5-minute part-time job.

117
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:51,450
Thanks for visiting.

118
00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:54,650
Balloons are only for kids.

119
00:07:54,650 --> 00:07:56,410
What about ice cream?

120
00:07:57,610 --> 00:08:01,110
Ice cream is for me to heal myself.

121
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:03,370
Have a bite, please.

122
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:07,430
A new life experience starts with your first taste of ice cream.

123
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:24,630
Run!

124
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:32,640
Running away like this after causing trouble?

125
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,560
Or what?

126
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:40,310
Feeling good after doing something bad?

127
00:08:41,310 --> 00:08:43,110
Do you feel good?

128
00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:46,990
I had bought all of the balloons.

129
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:51,510
Do you have to buy all those balloons to tease me?

130
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:52,850
I told you.

131
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:55,730
Balloons are only for kids.

132
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:59,590
Feeling good after teasing me?

133
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:03,760
You... Why aren't you eating?

134
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,430
You want it?

135
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:06,490
If you don't want it, I'll eat it.

136
00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:09,430
Come get it!

137
00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:11,390
Stop running!

138
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:39,510
Guo Guo, what are you doing?

139
00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:44,410
Grandmaster has been in his room for so long.

140
00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:47,230
What is he doing?

141
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:50,470
If you want to know, go and knock on his door.

142
00:09:51,770 --> 00:09:54,310
It's not proper.

143
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:57,300
The boss visiting her employee, nothing is improper.

144
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:58,870
Go.

145
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:04,730
Sounds plausible. I'm going.

146
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:10,600
 - From now on, you will do network administration tasks. 
 - Okay. 

147
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,710
 You will do cleaning work. 

148
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:16,270
 You will also do hard labor. 

149
00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:18,050
 I can provide you with food and lodging, 

150
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:21,300
 but I won't give you a cent. 

151
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:27,450
I didn't even give him money...

152
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:30,120
I was way too mean.

153
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:32,400
He's the Grandmaster.

154
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:35,080
Why did I boss him around as the network admin?

155
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,870
I even criticized him for not knowing how to change a light bulb,

156
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:38,810
treating him as a loser.

157
00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:44,150
How could he be a loser?

158
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:48,130
He is obviously cute.

159
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:53,110
 Will I never see Ye Qiu again? 

160
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:58,070
 You're the least qualified person to say that now. 

161
00:11:02,650 --> 00:11:06,930
Grandmaster was right. I'm the least qualified person.

162
00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:12,910
I spent so much time with him.

163
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:17,220
He silently cared about me, but I was kept in the dark.

164
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:25,430
Tang, do you think it's my blessing?

165
00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:29,550
I don't think it's a blessing.

166
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:32,590
It's revenge.

167
00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:35,690
It's for being with him for a month and

168
00:11:35,690 --> 00:11:40,660
failing-to-recognize-him type of revenge.

169
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:42,060
 - Boss. 
 - Yes? 

170
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:44,040
 You have a good eye for these posters. 

171
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:46,990
 It's very sharp and unique. The cardboard cutout is well done. 

172
00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:50,830
 Taller than Ye Qiu himself. Garage Kits videos are also great. 

173
00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:53,570
 Why don't we be thorough? 

174
00:11:53,570 --> 00:11:55,310
 Let's change the password of the net cafe, too. 

175
00:11:55,310 --> 00:12:01,050
 Let's use "Ye Qiu is invincibly the most handsome." 

176
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:07,790
 Ye Qiu is invincibly the most handsome. 

177
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:10,830
 That's a good one. 

178
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:13,850
 I feel the vibe of the net cafe has changed. 

179
00:12:14,690 --> 00:12:17,620
 You should know I just used rhetoric. 

180
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:20,460
 It's called irony. 

181
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:25,420
Irony. This is Grandmaster being ironic to me.

182
00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:30,140
Why did I always push him so hard?

183
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:34,050
I was baring my heart as a fan while scolding him as a boss.

184
00:12:34,050 --> 00:12:38,270
Look how quickly I switched my mode!

185
00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:41,270
Tang, what should I do?

186
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:43,350
What if Grandmaster leaves?

187
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:45,910
What if he doesn't leave today but leaves tomorrow?

188
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:49,570
What if it's not tomorrow but the day after?

189
00:12:50,210 --> 00:12:52,550
Turn right. The second room. Go kidnap him now.

190
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:56,130
Or wait for him quietly at his door until he's touched.

191
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:02,266
Wait.

192
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:06,740
Kidnapping isn't a good option.

193
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:09,310
It'd make me look crude.

194
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,820
But waiting isn't an option, either.

195
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:16,330
It'd make me look stupid.

196
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:19,280
Then, what will you do?

197
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:32,940
I heard some noise.

198
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:41,650
He's throwing things. Is he mad?

199
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:45,800
He just closed the closet.

200
00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:48,670
He's coming out.

201
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:52,670
Boss.

202
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:56,590
What are you doing?

203
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:10,030
Boss, move aside, please. You're blocking the door.

204
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:18,960
Please go in.

205
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,750
Are you okay?

206
00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:23,450
I'm okay.

207
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:30,970
Really?

208
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:34,310
Yes.

209
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:44,240
Did he just smile at me?

210
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:48,260
- Did he? 
 - Yes.

211
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:52,430
And his smile was creepy.

212
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:56,760
Is he going to part ways with me?

213
00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:05,140
I may look domineering at work, but I didn't mean it.

214
00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:10,110
Tang! Tang! Come back! Tang!

215
00:15:10,890 --> 00:15:12,570
Don't.

216
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:16,930
Need anything?

217
00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:19,230
Could be something or nothing.

218
00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:20,650
Depends on what you'll say.

219
00:15:20,650 --> 00:15:22,790
You can say something or nothing.

220
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:24,700
Depends on what you'll ask.

221
00:15:28,170 --> 00:15:29,790
Want something to drink?

222
00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:32,890
Anything.

223
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:35,870
Then, tea.

224
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:39,430
Dragon Raising its Head is a powerful combo.

225
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:41,590
Why is it not in the strategy guide you gave me?

226
00:15:41,590 --> 00:15:44,770
Will you not learn if it's not there?

227
00:15:44,770 --> 00:15:48,320
I'm not saying that. I can always steal the skill from the master.

228
00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:54,350
Steal from the master.

229
00:15:55,710 --> 00:16:00,230
Stolen skills are more valuable, right?

230
00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:08,190
So...

231
00:16:08,190 --> 00:16:13,440
A stolen name is also more valuable, right?

232
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:16,900
I'd value my salary more.

233
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:20,290
Please ask the boss when the payday will be.

234
00:16:21,310 --> 00:16:24,960
Didn't Guo Guo tell you? She never pays the salary each month.

235
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:28,270
It's a 10-year contract. Salary is bi-annual.

236
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:36,570
So it's a contract of selling myself.

237
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:39,190
Want to terminate the contract?

238
00:16:39,190 --> 00:16:41,250
Selling myself means...

239
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:45,470
 I could never leave even if I wanted to. 

240
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:49,662
 Have a good rest. 

241
00:16:58,790 --> 00:17:01,070
Did you hear everything?

242
00:17:01,070 --> 00:17:02,730
Go to bed.

243
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:05,190
He said he could never leave even if he wanted to.

244
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:07,150
What does it mean?

245
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:11,920
Does he want to leave? Or not?

246
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:16,520
Wait. Will he leave or not?

247
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:59,150
Put it here.

248
00:18:06,650 --> 00:18:11,710
Guo Guo, what's your plan?

249
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:19,200
Holding on to his luggage is like watching over him.

250
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:22,720
- Beauty. 
 - Yes?

251
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:25,450
Well, this is my seat.

252
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:29,270
- We're friends. We're just chatting. 
 - Friends?

253
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:30,650
- Yes. 
 - It's okay. Take my seat.

254
00:18:30,650 --> 00:18:32,980
- I'm sorry. 
 - It's okay.

255
00:18:36,690 --> 00:18:39,990
Bro, you look familiar.

256
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:41,780
Do I know you?

257
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:47,050
Now I remember. You look like an esports player.

258
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:51,330
- Really? People say it often. 
 - See?

259
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:52,380
Handsome, we're done chatting.

260
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:53,640
Wait a sec. You are...

261
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:55,150
You can go back to your own seat.

262
00:18:55,150 --> 00:18:56,620
Troubling Rain.

263
00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:58,070
Right!

264
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:00,340
Am I right?

265
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:02,330
He does look like him.

266
00:19:02,330 --> 00:19:03,910
He does.

267
00:19:15,470 --> 00:19:17,950
 If I remember correctly, on this day last month Grandmaster Ye Qiu 

268
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:19,830
 announced his retirement. 

269
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:21,480
 Many fans are very curious about 

270
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:24,390
 what the grandmaster has been doing this month. 

271
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:27,930
 If I were him, after seven years with the Glory professional league 

272
00:19:27,930 --> 00:19:29,250
 and competing in tournaments for such a long time, 

273
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:31,250
 I would take a long vacation. 

274
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:34,180
 Go to a remote island and enjoy the sun and the beach. 

275
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:35,570
 - And enjoy the waves and the view.   
 - Boss.

276
00:19:35,570 --> 00:19:37,400
 - The sun, the beach, and the waves...  
 - Boss.

277
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:41,890
 - I'm not quite sure about that, but in the recent Glory All-Star...  
 - You're pulling my seat belt.

278
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:44,990
 We've seen Grandmaster Ye Qiu's combo: "Dragon Raising its Head." 

279
00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:47,080
 It's something many people didn't expect. 

280
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:51,590
 Right. We want to hear what other pro players would say. 

281
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,390
 No comment. 

282
00:19:55,390 --> 00:19:58,350
 What our captain means is we don't know what's going on with Ye Qiu. 

283
00:19:58,350 --> 00:20:00,240
 But if he wants to come back to the league, 
   

284
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,330
 we'll definitely support him. 

285
00:20:01,330 --> 00:20:05,020
 - In my opinion— 
 - We don't know what's going on with Excellent Era and Ye Qiu. 

286
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:06,250
 But as his friends, 

287
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:09,150
 we believe there's a reason behind his actions. 

288
00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:11,870
 Each profession has its strength. 

289
00:20:11,870 --> 00:20:14,910
 The key is the person playing it. 

290
00:20:14,910 --> 00:20:17,230
 Xiao Luo, at the recent All-Star Game, 

291
00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:19,390
 you were invited to be the host. 

292
00:20:19,390 --> 00:20:21,030
 Any inside information you can share with us? 

293
00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:22,990
 None. I was very surprised, too. 

294
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:26,910
 Team Samsara originally planned to invite Grandmaster Ye Qiu as a special guest 

295
00:20:26,910 --> 00:20:28,550
 to attend the live event. 

296
00:20:28,550 --> 00:20:30,550
 But after the grandmaster retired, 

297
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:32,900
 all his contact info didn't work anymore. 

298
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:35,710
 We have no way to invite him to join us. 

299
00:20:35,710 --> 00:20:37,700
 But I'm really curious. 

300
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:41,270
 Why did Grandmaster Ye Qiu suddenly retire? 

301
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:44,350
 When Excellent Era announced Ye Qiu's retirement, the reason they gave was 

302
00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:45,910
 his overall play was declining. 

303
00:20:45,910 --> 00:20:47,330
 So he decided to retire and stay behind the scenes. 

304
00:20:47,330 --> 00:20:50,460
 Since he could still execute Dragon Raising Its Head, 

305
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:53,450
 the decline in his overall play seems untrue. 

306
00:20:53,450 --> 00:20:55,670
 What you just said sent a chill down my spine. 

307
00:20:55,670 --> 00:20:57,790
 We don't know the inside story. 

308
00:20:57,790 --> 00:20:59,320
 But what I know is 

309
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:03,500
 no media outlet was able to interview anyone from Excellent Era at present. 

310
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:04,530
 What's going on? 

311
00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:06,580
 Let's wait for more first-hand information. 

312
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:08,830
In short, it's total bullshit!

313
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:10,480
It's more than just a chill down the spine.

314
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,670
It's a chill in my heart.

315
00:21:12,670 --> 00:21:15,100
Excellent Era kicked Grandmaster Ye Qiu out

316
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:17,520
and found the rookie Sun Xiang to replace him.

317
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:18,990
What the heck?

318
00:21:18,990 --> 00:21:20,710
Sun Xiang is quite competitive.

319
00:21:20,710 --> 00:21:21,641
- After all— 
 - Wait, wait...

320
00:21:21,641 --> 00:21:24,340
Was that just a total coincidence?

321
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:25,550
One gets in and the other one gets out.

322
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:29,030
Excellent Era must have planned everything early on.

323
00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:31,460
Previously, he didn't perform well in Team Conquering Cloud.

324
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:33,390
Going to Excellent Era gives him a better opportunity for growth.

325
00:21:33,390 --> 00:21:35,900
Damn! A new talent?

326
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:39,790
No matter how competitive he is, he is, at most, a rookie.

327
00:21:39,790 --> 00:21:41,590
How could he ever compare to Grandmaster Ye Qiu?

328
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:42,740
You saw that, too.

329
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:43,870
He's using One Autumn Leaf.

330
00:21:43,870 --> 00:21:44,990
Is he playing it well?

331
00:21:44,990 --> 00:21:46,870
He was still defeated by Desert Dust.

332
00:21:46,870 --> 00:21:48,390
Right?

333
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:50,340
- You are new, right? 
 - Yes.

334
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:52,330
- Just started doing interviews? 
 - Yes.

335
00:21:52,330 --> 00:21:54,260
When you are in this industry long enough, you will know.

336
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:56,290
Rookies are laughing while retirees are weeping.

337
00:21:56,290 --> 00:21:58,150
The laws of nature.

338
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:00,740
I only believe in my Grandmaster.

339
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:02,410
Keep doing that.

340
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:06,730
Look!

341
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:09,810
They're back!

342
00:22:09,810 --> 00:22:12,250
Hurry up! Follow them!

343
00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:14,640
I'll protect Grandmaster!

344
00:22:15,970 --> 00:22:18,290
You! Hurry up!

345
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:22,530
Don't come close!

346
00:22:22,530 --> 00:22:24,220
Don't come close!

347
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:25,830
Don't come near!

348
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:28,170
Don't come near!

349
00:22:30,570 --> 00:22:34,460
Seems like he's not the one they're waiting for.

350
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:36,311
Guo Guo. 
    

351
00:22:36,311 --> 00:22:38,230
You've gone a bit too far. 
    

352
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:41,690
 - What happened? 
 - Who knows? 

353
00:22:46,350 --> 00:22:47,840
Boss.

354
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:52,350
You've ruined my hair.

355
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:02,510
Chu,

356
00:23:02,510 --> 00:23:05,490
you did a good job.

357
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:25,430
Chairman Tao! Chairman Tao!

358
00:23:25,430 --> 00:23:26,710
Can you open the window, please?

359
00:23:26,710 --> 00:23:27,530
Chairman Tao!

360
00:23:27,530 --> 00:23:30,550
How was Ye Qiu able to execute Dragon Raising its Head at the All-Star Game yesterday?

361
00:23:30,550 --> 00:23:32,200
You said his overall play has already declined.

362
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:34,550
If that was not the case, why did he retire?

363
00:23:34,550 --> 00:23:36,700
Captain Sun, as the account owner of One Autumn Leaf,

364
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:38,040
you don't know how to execute Dragon Raising its Head.

365
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:39,570
Don't you think you're wasting usage of a high-level account?

366
00:23:39,570 --> 00:23:41,010
Captain Sun, can you explain?

367
00:23:41,010 --> 00:23:42,350
Captain Sun, you...

368
00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:43,950
- Who asked the question? Step up! 
 - Shut up!

369
00:23:43,950 --> 00:23:45,950
Watch out!

370
00:23:45,950 --> 00:23:47,190
Thanks for your attention.

371
00:23:47,190 --> 00:23:48,660
We'll hold a press conference soon.

372
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:50,640
You're all welcome to attend. Thank you. Thank you.

373
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,300
Drive.

374
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:56,550
Don't go. Answer the question.

375
00:24:04,790 --> 00:24:08,930
Boss, do you still need the workbook on the front desk?

376
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:15,560
Is it that scary?

377
00:24:22,390 --> 00:24:23,770
 Dragon Raising its Head! 

378
00:24:23,770 --> 00:24:25,870
 Soft Mist actually executed Glory's top-tier player Ye Qiu's 

379
00:24:25,870 --> 00:24:28,650
 famous combo Dragon Raising its Head! 

380
00:24:28,650 --> 00:24:31,140
 The reappearance of Dragon Raising Its Head has caused a buzz in the pro scene. 

381
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:34,290
 Players from other teams are rooting for his comeback. 

382
00:24:34,290 --> 00:24:36,170
 The Dragon Raising its Head incident in the All-Star game continues to be widely discussed. 

383
00:24:36,170 --> 00:24:38,490
 Today, a lot of media outlets flooded into Excellent Era's building. 

384
00:24:38,490 --> 00:24:40,110
See?

385
00:24:40,110 --> 00:24:43,330
All the media are focusing on Excellent Era.

386
00:24:44,230 --> 00:24:47,510
After your three consecutive championships,

387
00:24:47,510 --> 00:24:50,310
I haven't seen this kind of attention for a while.

388
00:24:52,710 --> 00:24:55,870
You don't have to worry about the media.

389
00:24:55,870 --> 00:24:57,430
I have assigned the task to PR.

390
00:24:57,430 --> 00:24:59,480
The reporters at the door won't stay for long.

391
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:03,950
Everything will be settled once the press conference is held.

392
00:25:05,030 --> 00:25:09,750
Don't tell me you knew nothing about Ye Qiu's appearance at the All-Star.

393
00:25:10,470 --> 00:25:12,110
Ye Qiu...

394
00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:14,490
He didn't show up at the All-Star.

395
00:25:14,490 --> 00:25:15,830
Really?

396
00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:17,870
So the media reports were fake news?

397
00:25:17,870 --> 00:25:19,110
It could be true.

398
00:25:19,110 --> 00:25:20,980
It could also be fake.

399
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:24,260
Ye Qiu has never shown up in public.

400
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:27,560
No media took a single photo of him this time.

401
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:32,190
No one saw who executed Dragon Raising its Head.

402
00:25:32,190 --> 00:25:35,900
So if we say it wasn't Ye Qiu, it's not hard to believe.

403
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:38,190
Chairman Tao, you're really something.

404
00:25:38,190 --> 00:25:40,570
Being so calm while deceiving yourself and others.

405
00:25:40,570 --> 00:25:42,370
That is Dragon Raising its Head.

406
00:25:42,370 --> 00:25:45,170
Only Ye Qiu can execute it.

407
00:25:45,170 --> 00:25:47,350
The fans are not blind.

408
00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:50,730
You don't have to worry about it.

409
00:25:50,730 --> 00:25:52,030
Just spend more money.

410
00:25:52,030 --> 00:25:53,770
When media relations is done,

411
00:25:53,770 --> 00:25:56,300
I'll send someone to engage with the fans.

412
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:58,730
Things will be different soon. 
    

413
00:25:58,730 --> 00:26:02,290
I don't care about the media or the fans.

414
00:26:02,290 --> 00:26:04,940
What I'm concerned about is the market valuation of Excellent Era,

415
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:08,100
the possibility for it to secure the next round of financing.

416
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:12,370
Chairman Tao, we're both clear that esports is just business.

417
00:26:12,370 --> 00:26:16,220
I've invested in it because I can see its business potential.

418
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:17,510
But a month ago,

419
00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:20,130
the market valuation has already dropped to its lowest in two years.

420
00:26:20,130 --> 00:26:21,710
You said the key was to find a new talent.

421
00:26:21,710 --> 00:26:23,490
You named Sun Xiang. Fine.

422
00:26:23,490 --> 00:26:25,150
What now?

423
00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:26,710
No improvement in market valuation.

424
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:29,380
Instead, Excellent Era has ruined its reputation.

425
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:32,120
Sun Xiang has more commercial value than Ye Qiu.

426
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:34,390
You and I both know it clearly.

427
00:26:34,390 --> 00:26:36,580
They're just going through an integration period.

428
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:39,290
We need to be patient.

429
00:26:41,230 --> 00:26:44,840
I'll try my best to deal with this emergency.

430
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:46,810
Hoping for a smooth transition.

431
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:53,020
Don't worry.

432
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:56,950
Excellent Era will bounce back soon.

433
00:26:57,830 --> 00:26:59,490
Chairman Tao.

434
00:27:03,730 --> 00:27:05,990
I hope you are not making empty promises.

435
00:27:05,990 --> 00:27:09,210
Show me something real.

436
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:12,870
Or... with all the opportunities in the market,

437
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:16,330
I could still weigh my options.

438
00:27:24,070 --> 00:27:26,510
Ye Qiu is really something.

439
00:27:26,510 --> 00:27:27,950
Think about Dragon Raising its Head.

440
00:27:27,950 --> 00:27:29,350
Really interesting.

441
00:27:29,350 --> 00:27:31,560
When Rising Dragon Soars the Sky is executed,

442
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:35,110
you could still redirect it when you miss the target.

443
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:38,020
It doesn't matter if you make a bad move,

444
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:40,270
you just have to know how to make a timely remedy.

445
00:27:40,270 --> 00:27:41,820
So in my eyes,

446
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:46,450
whether the dragon is raising its head or lowering it,

447
00:27:46,450 --> 00:27:49,974
winning is the best strategy.

448
00:27:55,190 --> 00:27:58,070
   

449
00:27:58,070 --> 00:27:59,510
   

450
00:27:59,510 --> 00:28:02,420
Boss, there's something wrong with this computer.

451
00:28:03,161 --> 00:28:05,390
Go fix it.

452
00:28:14,390 --> 00:28:16,190
- Boss. 
 - Chu.

453
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:20,500
Chu, what's wrong with the computer? Did you check it?

454
00:29:03,390 --> 00:29:04,830
Boss.

455
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:12,050
The jacket needs washing.

456
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:21,480
Why is Guo Guo avoiding you like she's avoiding a virus?

457
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:24,790
I'd say she's quite ill.

458
00:29:26,570 --> 00:29:28,310
What's wrong?

459
00:29:28,310 --> 00:29:30,370
Late stage of social anxiety disorder.

460
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:34,220
It looks like...

461
00:29:36,070 --> 00:29:37,990
we have to take drastic measures.

462
00:29:37,990 --> 00:29:39,030
Director Cao, listen to me. 
    

463
00:29:39,030 --> 00:29:41,450
Though I didn't take any pictures of Sun Xiang, I did get inside info.

464
00:29:41,450 --> 00:29:44,790
Grandmaster Ye Qiu had already left Excellent Era a day before the press conference.

465
00:29:44,790 --> 00:29:46,810
Something fishy is going on here.

466
00:29:52,210 --> 00:29:53,271
Sun Xiang is just a small potato.

467
00:29:53,271 --> 00:29:55,670
Who really matters is Grandmaster Ye Qiu.

468
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:59,431
Don't, Director, why are you suddenly taking Excellent Era's side?

469
00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:03,810
I'm not focusing on the insignificant details. Didn't you teach us?

470
00:30:03,810 --> 00:30:05,780
News reporting must be truthful, objective, and fair.

471
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:07,590
That's what I've been doing.

472
00:30:08,410 --> 00:30:09,674
What about this?

473
00:30:09,674 --> 00:30:11,930
Director, grant me some travel expenses.

474
00:30:11,930 --> 00:30:14,930
I'll wait at Excellent Era's gate. And I'll find Grandmaster Ye Qiu.

475
00:30:14,930 --> 00:30:16,710
Then we can interview him.

476
00:30:16,710 --> 00:30:18,790
Hello... Hello...

477
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:21,510
What?

478
00:30:21,510 --> 00:30:22,886
Hung up on me again?

479
00:30:22,886 --> 00:30:24,458
   

480
00:30:26,190 --> 00:30:30,070
Grandmaster Ye Qiu, where are you?

481
00:30:42,950 --> 00:30:46,310
It's near Excellent Era. What if...

482
00:30:54,650 --> 00:30:57,670
Hey, Network Admin. Nice mask!

483
00:30:57,670 --> 00:30:59,850
Is it? Thank you!

484
00:30:59,850 --> 00:31:02,770
May I know your last name?

485
00:31:02,770 --> 00:31:03,500
Ye.

486
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:05,100
I knew it!

487
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:06,690
Knew what?

488
00:31:07,310 --> 00:31:10,590
To tell you the truth, I... I'm a reporter.

489
00:31:10,590 --> 00:31:12,990
Can I ask you a few questions?

490
00:31:13,810 --> 00:31:15,430
What is there to interview about?

491
00:31:15,430 --> 00:31:18,220
People say you play like Ye Qiu.

492
00:31:18,930 --> 00:31:20,790
My boss says so.

493
00:31:20,790 --> 00:31:23,190
How do you view Ye Qiu?

494
00:31:23,190 --> 00:31:24,570
He's my boss's idol.

495
00:31:24,570 --> 00:31:26,850
Do you know about Dragon Raising its Head?

496
00:31:28,270 --> 00:31:29,650
My boss does.

497
00:31:29,650 --> 00:31:33,230
Why do you keep talking about your boss?

498
00:31:35,330 --> 00:31:37,070
Because I'm just the network admin.

499
00:31:37,070 --> 00:31:40,470
If you want to interview me, you need to get her consent.

500
00:31:40,470 --> 00:31:42,460
Where is your boss?

501
00:31:46,470 --> 00:31:47,740
Sleeping on the second floor.

502
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:49,330
Thank you.

503
00:31:55,510 --> 00:31:59,010
Boss, time to get up.

504
00:32:01,310 --> 00:32:02,830
Boss.

505
00:32:04,630 --> 00:32:06,930
I'll sleep some more. Don't disturb me.

506
00:32:06,930 --> 00:32:08,820
Boss. Boss.

507
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:10,690
What are you doing?

508
00:32:11,890 --> 00:32:13,670
Boss, congrats!

509
00:32:13,670 --> 00:32:16,770
Happy Internet Cafe will be famous soon.

510
00:32:17,270 --> 00:32:19,350
Don't press on me with your big belly.

511
00:32:19,350 --> 00:32:20,990
Sure.

512
00:32:21,470 --> 00:32:23,720
What the heck?

513
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:28,510
Boss, the day when the 10th server of Glory was launched,

514
00:32:28,510 --> 00:32:31,370
I was attacking Midnight Phantom Cat in this net cafe.

515
00:32:38,370 --> 00:32:40,570
 This was just fine. 

516
00:32:42,230 --> 00:32:43,840
 Turn the screen around. 

517
00:32:44,430 --> 00:32:45,710
 It's done. 

518
00:32:45,710 --> 00:32:46,870
 Same line of work? 

519
00:32:46,870 --> 00:32:48,130
 Get me a bottle of water. 

520
00:32:48,130 --> 00:32:49,821
 Let me get it. 

521
00:32:54,870 --> 00:32:57,380
 How much is the salary in your internet cafe? 

522
00:32:57,380 --> 00:32:59,260
 Are they still hiring? 

523
00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:01,230
 I am not your peer. 

524
00:33:01,230 --> 00:33:05,090
Was that the day when Network Admin Ye first started working here?

525
00:33:05,770 --> 00:33:07,120
Yes.

526
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:09,420
I knew it!

527
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:11,470
What are you talking about?

528
00:33:11,470 --> 00:33:12,950
I have an assumption.

529
00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:18,110
Network Admin Ye could be Grandmaster Ye Qiu.

530
00:33:19,310 --> 00:33:21,390
How is that possible?

531
00:33:21,390 --> 00:33:22,420
Listen to me.

532
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:25,870
According to my investigation, the day the 10th server of Glory was launched

533
00:33:25,870 --> 00:33:28,170
was the day Grandmaster Ye Qiu left Excellent Era.

534
00:33:28,170 --> 00:33:29,880
Think about it.

535
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:35,810
When he left Excellent Era, the Grandmaster looked around.

536
00:33:35,810 --> 00:33:37,630
He had nowhere to go.

537
00:33:37,630 --> 00:33:42,110
So he crossed the street and walked into your net cafe.

538
00:33:42,110 --> 00:33:44,690
He ended up being your network admin.

539
00:33:46,410 --> 00:33:48,130
 You're paying the bill, right? 

540
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:50,950
 I'm here to apply for a job. 

541
00:33:50,950 --> 00:33:54,730
   

542
00:33:54,730 --> 00:33:56,870
That's impossible.

543
00:33:56,870 --> 00:33:58,730
Surprised?

544
00:33:58,730 --> 00:34:00,470
Me too.

545
00:34:00,470 --> 00:34:03,290
But just now, I suddenly realized.

546
00:34:03,290 --> 00:34:05,070
My assumption is flawless.

547
00:34:05,070 --> 00:34:06,870
How is it...

548
00:34:06,870 --> 00:34:08,130
- Wait. 
 - Think about it.

549
00:34:08,130 --> 00:34:09,630
The little hermit lives in the wild,

550
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:11,300
while the bigger hermit is in the city.

551
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:16,790
What I didn't expect was that our Grandmaster had been hiding at the net cafe across the street.

552
00:34:16,790 --> 00:34:18,760
As if he's telling us:

553
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:21,580
"Look. I'll be back. I'm just in front of you."

554
00:34:21,580 --> 00:34:24,740
Your imagination is so vivid! That's impossible!

555
00:34:24,740 --> 00:34:28,110
But what I said is plausible, right?

556
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:30,720
You're Ye Qiu's fan, right?

557
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:35,310
I can tell from the decorations in this net cafe.

558
00:34:35,310 --> 00:34:36,810
Think about it.

559
00:34:36,810 --> 00:34:40,190
Look, our idol is in front of us.

560
00:34:40,190 --> 00:34:42,460
Nobody else knows except you and me.

561
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:44,260
Now we're kind of in the same boat.

562
00:34:44,260 --> 00:34:46,740
Wait here. I'll investigate and collect some evidence.

563
00:34:46,740 --> 00:34:47,790
Don't stop me.

564
00:34:47,790 --> 00:34:49,310
No way!

565
00:34:49,310 --> 00:34:51,750
- What? 
 - He isn't Ye Qiu.

566
00:34:51,750 --> 00:34:54,630
He isn't Ye Qiu.

567
00:34:54,630 --> 00:34:56,890
Look at him.

568
00:34:56,890 --> 00:34:58,520
He is mean and clumsy.

569
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:00,380
He can't do anything and doesn't know how to do the accounts.

570
00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:03,640
How could he be Ye Qiu? Right?

571
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:06,190
- Really? 
 - Yes.

572
00:35:06,190 --> 00:35:10,490
If it's true, why do you still keep him here?

573
00:35:14,270 --> 00:35:16,300
None of your business.

574
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:18,910
Do you have an agenda?

575
00:35:18,910 --> 00:35:19,870
Nope.

576
00:35:19,870 --> 00:35:21,731
You know it's him. So you want to keep him here.

577
00:35:21,731 --> 00:35:22,521
No.

578
00:35:22,521 --> 00:35:24,340
You kidnapped, threatened, and house-arrested him.

579
00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:26,321
- Not true. 
 - Then let me investigate him.

580
00:35:26,321 --> 00:35:27,950
Thank you.

581
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:32,650
Stop!

582
00:35:33,190 --> 00:35:34,740
Brother Ye!

583
00:35:36,910 --> 00:35:38,790
Brother Ye! Your boss gave me the consent.

584
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,200
I didn't!

585
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:41,030
You did!

586
00:35:41,030 --> 00:35:44,580
- Brother Ye, are you doing well here? 
 - I...

587
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:45,940
Meals, accommodation, and internet are included.

588
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:47,190
He's doing very well.

589
00:35:47,190 --> 00:35:48,710
Yes. My boss is right.

590
00:35:48,710 --> 00:35:51,020
It's my dream job.

591
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:52,380
Brother Ye.

592
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:55,180
Are you still training regularly?

593
00:35:55,180 --> 00:35:57,570
Cleaning tables, moving chairs, and fixing computers.

594
00:35:57,570 --> 00:35:59,500
He's training every day.

595
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:00,730
- Right? 
 - Right.

596
00:36:00,730 --> 00:36:03,110
I'm the best network admin.

597
00:36:09,450 --> 00:36:10,710
Do you still play Glory?

598
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:13,511
Which server? Are you performing amazingly?

599
00:36:13,511 --> 00:36:16,350
A noob in the 10th Server. Just as a pastime.

600
00:36:16,350 --> 00:36:18,270
- Just a nobody. 
 - Correct.

601
00:36:18,270 --> 00:36:19,990
Very much a noob.

602
00:36:19,990 --> 00:36:21,330
You're also in the 10th Server.

603
00:36:21,330 --> 00:36:23,450
What's your IGN? Are you in any guild?

604
00:36:23,450 --> 00:36:25,010
That's something private.

605
00:36:25,010 --> 00:36:26,520
Brother Ye!

606
00:36:27,070 --> 00:36:28,040
Boss! Boss!

607
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:29,400
It's stuck. Come fix it!

608
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:32,630
I'm Sleeping Moon, the guild master of Full Moon Guild.

609
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:38,770
So it's you!

610
00:36:38,770 --> 00:36:40,940
Brother Ye, have you heard about me?

611
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:42,960
After all, I was on the Record List!

612
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:44,740
No big deal.

613
00:36:45,290 --> 00:36:46,920
You were on the Record List?

614
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:48,150
You are amazing!

615
00:36:48,150 --> 00:36:49,670
Not bad.

616
00:36:49,670 --> 00:36:52,090
I'm a veteran in three servers.

617
00:36:52,090 --> 00:36:54,290
Getting on the record list is no big deal.

618
00:36:54,290 --> 00:36:57,770
Wasn't it because someone helped you?

619
00:36:57,770 --> 00:37:00,670
That's true. But it's not important.

620
00:37:00,670 --> 00:37:04,490
Brother, what profession do you play? Battlemage?

621
00:37:04,490 --> 00:37:05,370
I'm...

622
00:37:05,370 --> 00:37:08,110
- Done. Sorry for that. 
 - Thanks!

623
00:37:08,110 --> 00:37:09,420
Unspecialized.

624
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:11,350
What? Unspecialized?

625
00:37:11,350 --> 00:37:13,550
What is it?

626
00:37:14,270 --> 00:37:16,360
Stop it, Little Moon Moon.

627
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:19,190
Little... Moon...

628
00:37:19,190 --> 00:37:21,690
Are you Lord...

629
00:37:21,690 --> 00:37:23,450
Your benefactor.

630
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:25,390
Lord Grim.

631
00:37:25,390 --> 00:37:27,130
I've told you. It's not him.

632
00:37:27,130 --> 00:37:28,220
It's impossible!

633
00:37:28,220 --> 00:37:30,020
It's not possible at all.

634
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:32,541
Sorry. I have things to do. I need to go.

635
00:37:32,541 --> 00:37:33,750
Think about it thoroughly.

636
00:37:33,750 --> 00:37:36,410
- He's definitely not One Autumn Leaf! 
 - He's gone.

637
00:37:41,810 --> 00:37:44,670
Never reveal your identity.

638
00:37:48,460 --> 00:37:50,560
You are finally talking to me,

639
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,030
Boss.

640
00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:56,610
Talking about what?

641
00:37:56,610 --> 00:37:58,290
Go on working!

642
00:38:09,390 --> 00:38:11,580
Due to our internal issues, 
    

643
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:13,730
the net cafe will be temporarily closed from today onwards.

644
00:38:13,730 --> 00:38:16,130
If there is any inconvenience...

645
00:38:16,860 --> 00:38:19,690
If there is any inconvenience...

646
00:38:20,310 --> 00:38:23,100
do whatever you see fit.

647
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:26,350
Guo Guo, what are you doing?

648
00:38:26,350 --> 00:38:27,590
You scared me.

649
00:38:27,590 --> 00:38:30,270
Why were you walking so quietly?

650
00:38:30,270 --> 00:38:32,210
The net cafe will close suddenly.

651
00:38:32,210 --> 00:38:33,950
What happened?

652
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:39,040
I'm worried something bad will happen.

653
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:42,310
Have you seen the reporter come and go every day?

654
00:38:42,310 --> 00:38:44,170
What if he does the same thing?

655
00:38:44,170 --> 00:38:46,070
Then Grandmaster's identity will be exposed.

656
00:38:46,070 --> 00:38:48,830
If that happens,

657
00:38:48,830 --> 00:38:51,240
he can't stay here anymore.

658
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:53,910
If he can't stay here, where would he go?

659
00:38:53,910 --> 00:38:56,590
He'd be homeless.

660
00:38:58,770 --> 00:39:00,250
No way.

661
00:39:00,250 --> 00:39:02,670
I must keep him here.

662
00:39:05,970 --> 00:39:10,330
I'd rather close the net cafe.

663
00:39:11,190 --> 00:39:13,310
Close the net cafe?

664
00:39:13,310 --> 00:39:17,290
Have you ever thought about if you closed it,

665
00:39:17,290 --> 00:39:20,560
wouldn't the reporter be more suspicious? Right?

666
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:22,470
You're right!

667
00:39:22,470 --> 00:39:26,070
- It's like I'm making a confession without duress. 
 - Exactly!

668
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:32,790
Not closing the shop anymore?

669
00:39:36,690 --> 00:39:38,990
Where is it?

670
00:39:41,590 --> 00:39:42,970
What are you looking for?

671
00:39:42,970 --> 00:39:45,610
If I can't prevent others from coming in,

672
00:39:45,610 --> 00:39:48,840
I need to make changes inside.

673
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:53,770
How many locks should I put on the attic?

674
00:39:53,770 --> 00:39:56,530
What? Locks?

675
00:39:57,090 --> 00:39:58,830
Or...

676
00:39:59,430 --> 00:40:02,490
I can demolish the stairs to the attic.

677
00:40:02,490 --> 00:40:04,170
After all, he stays indoors.

678
00:40:04,170 --> 00:40:06,150
There shouldn't be any problem if he stays up there for over 10 days.

679
00:40:06,150 --> 00:40:10,570
Wait, Guo Guo. What you are saying is so weird.

680
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:15,410
I will give him a computer.

681
00:40:15,410 --> 00:40:18,760
After all, as long as he has Glory in his world, he'll be fine.

682
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:22,510
As long as he doesn't expose himself, the journalists won't know.

683
00:40:23,370 --> 00:40:24,790
Perfect.

684
00:40:24,790 --> 00:40:26,150
How is it perfect?

685
00:40:26,150 --> 00:40:29,770
Even if journalists won't come, the police will.

686
00:40:29,770 --> 00:40:33,470
Nothing will work. What should I do?

687
00:40:33,470 --> 00:40:35,460
I'm running out of options.

688
00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:41,500
Guo Guo, it's quite simple if you really want to keep him here.

689
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:43,630
Then what should I do?

690
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:51,070
Should I break his legs?

691
00:40:52,910 --> 00:40:54,900
That's not impossible.

692
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:56,270
As long as he has his hands.

693
00:40:56,270 --> 00:40:57,710
Of course not!

694
00:40:57,710 --> 00:41:00,810
What nonsense are you thinking about right now?

695
00:41:01,430 --> 00:41:03,000
I mean...

696
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:08,470
If you want to keep someone from leaving, win his heart first.

697
00:41:11,770 --> 00:41:13,240
How?

698
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:14,900
Two words.

699
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:16,810
Spoil him.

700
00:41:20,470 --> 00:41:23,060
Spoil him?

701
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:34,020
