♫  Finally at this moment of peak  ♫

00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:21,190
♫  Fireflies making every effort to illuminate  ♫

00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:24,880
♫  Fireflies making every effort to illuminate  ♫

23
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:27,920

25
00:01:31,370 --> 00:01:35,290
   

26
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:39,548
- I'm paying now. 
 - Okay.

27
00:01:39,548 --> 00:01:41,313
 Boss, come here. 

28
00:01:41,313 --> 00:01:42,480
I'm coming.

29
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:44,580
Wait a second.

30
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,620
Why am I getting a black screen again?

31
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:51,120
Am I playing Glory, or is the computer playing me?

32
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:59,990
 Subtitles and Timing provided to you by💥🍥 TEAM 7️⃣ 🍥💥 @viki.com 

33
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:08,860
Boss.

34
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:11,280
Is that man playing with your account?

35
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,320
Will he steal your equipment? 
    

36
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:14,900
Oh, no.

37
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:17,520
You brat, are you looking for trouble?

38
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:26,880
You won?

39
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:31,340
I saw the PK* started, so I played a round for you. 
  (*Player Kill) 

40
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:33,760
How long did it take fo you to win?

41
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,360
Forty seconds.

42
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:38,340
This is awesome.

43
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:39,600
 I won! 

44
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,100
 - Nice!  
 - Boss.

45
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:45,040
You said Glory was more than just a battle.

46
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:49,920
Then... what is Glory?

47
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,760
Glory...

48
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:59,000
It was Glory who brought us all together.

49
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:03,640
Glory is a world that belongs to all of us.

50
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,280
You're paying the bill, right?

51
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,960
Sorry about that.

52
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,760
I'm here to apply for a job.

53
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,460
What's your name?

54
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:21,960
Ye Xiu.

55
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:25,320
Ye what?

56
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,580
Ye Xiu.

57
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:31,380
Your name is so similar to the name of our Grandmaster in Glory.

58
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:33,340
Interesting.

59
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:35,740
Do you have any experience working as a network administrator?

60
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:37,240
None.

61
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:40,040
Can you help customers upgrade?

62
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,480
No.

63
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:47,720
Do you know how to check network operations?

64
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,080
No.

65
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,560
Do you know how to maintain network equipment, upgrade anti-virus software,

66
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,140
and detect malicious content?

67
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:56,021
No.

68
00:03:56,021 --> 00:03:58,360
What the hell do you know?

69
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:01,040
Well.

70
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,820
I know how to play Glory.

71
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:13,460
You‘re hired.

72
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:15,200
Let's get this straight.

73
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,840
You don't know anything.

74
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:20,300
If your performance is poor, I won't keep you on.

75
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:22,580
After all, I am not running a charity here.

76
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:24,940
What a mess.

77
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:28,820
Not bad.

78
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:32,360
This place is too good for me.

79
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:34,060
Sorry, but you're overthinking.

80
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:36,000
This is my room.

81
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,160
Your room....

82
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,780
Is over there.

83
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:48,080
Right here.

84
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,100
This...

85
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:04,040
It's slightly bad up here.

86
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:07,100
However, the staff dormitory is currently full.

87
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:09,260
It's okay. It's fine.

88
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:11,240
All I need is a bed.

89
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,200
The quilt is at the top of the bed.

90
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,800
Lay it out yourself. No rush.

91
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,240
Okay.

92
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:53,840
Stop.

93
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,220
Hello.

94
00:06:57,220 --> 00:06:58,580
Go and change the light bulb.

95
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:00,320
The light bulb?

96
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,640
There.

97
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,300
Okay.

98
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,220
What's wrong?

99
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:32,380
Check the switch.

100
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:36,340
Admin, where‘s the instant noodle I ordered?

101
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:37,361
Coming.

102
00:07:37,361 --> 00:07:40,380
Sorry. Sorry to keep you waiting. Sorry.

103
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:42,600
Admin, give me another hour.

104
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:45,720
Chu, Table 24 wants another hour.

105
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,780
Admin, give me another instant noodle.

106
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:51,040
All right. I am coming.

107
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,320
I told you to hurry up.

108
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:56,280
What the hell?

109
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:59,980
What's going on, Admin?

110
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,280
I am sorry.

111
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:04,460
We'll be closed for half a day.

112
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:06,840
Sorry. Come back tomorrow.

113
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:10,340
Sorry. Come back tomorrow.

114
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:13,501
For the first time, I realized that installing a light bulb is a technical job.

115
00:08:13,501 --> 00:08:15,240
I'll get someone to fix it.

116
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:17,460
Stop.

117
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:23,220
Let's talk about the loss you caused.

118
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:27,100
You can deduct today's loss from my salary.

119
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:30,040
All right.

120
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:33,520
A regular employee's monthly salary is 3,000 RMB.

121
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:36,000
You‘re still an intern, so you only get half at 1500 RMB.

122
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,840
Some customers did not pay the Internet fee of 427 RMB.

123
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:41,280
Their meal fee of 361 RMB.

124
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:44,840
The repair cost is 500 RMB. The insurance cost is 32 RMB.

125
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,640
Take a look.

126
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:51,620
This is today's loss.

127
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:56,300
It seems like it's a small loss at most.

128
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:58,760
Master, I will go back to work now.

129
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:03,540
Due to the repair time, I can only close the internet cafe. For the loss of income,

130
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:05,040
you are also liable for that.

131
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,841
It looks like you won't receive any salary this month.

132
00:09:06,841 --> 00:09:08,960
Today's loss is...

133
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,660
9,892.50 RMB.

134
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:21,060
When I say I'll bear the loss, I mean I'll pay for the light bulb.

135
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:26,520
Then I'll scrap the smaller amount?

136
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:29,121
- Nine thousand. 
 - 9,892.

137
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:31,940
How are you going to pay me?

138
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:38,640
Don't have an answer?

139
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:44,300
If you don't have an answer, then you'll have to listen to me.

140
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:56,140
From now on, you will do network administration tasks.

141
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:59,520
You will do cleaning work.

142
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:02,360
You will also do hard labor.

143
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,400
I can provide you with food and lodging,

144
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:10,640
but I won't give you a cent.

145
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:13,521
- Boss. 
 - You'll get paid according to the work you do.

146
00:10:13,521 --> 00:10:16,240
I will deduct them from your debt. Any problem?

147
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,640
I...

148
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:26,360
No problem.

149
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,040
Go work hard.

150
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:40,080
Financial crisis caused by a light bulb.

151
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:45,560
   

152
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:47,290
 Go, go, go. Get out quickly. 
   

153
00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:48,740
- Get out! 
 - Bro.

154
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:50,380
The club does not welcome reporters like you.

155
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:51,281
Listen to me, bro.

156
00:10:51,281 --> 00:10:53,160
Who doesn't know you're Ye Qiu's hardcore fan?

157
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:55,241
You've been snooping around all day for some gossip.

158
00:10:55,241 --> 00:10:57,120
   

159
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,940
Then don't let me in.

160
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:06,190
   

161
00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:08,770
   

162
00:11:08,770 --> 00:11:11,690
   

163
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:22,160
This was just fine.

164
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:30,180
Wait a minute. Let me check this first.

165
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:34,600
It will only take a few seconds.

166
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:38,360
Turn the screen around.

167
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:42,400
It's done.

168
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:48,080
Same line of work?

169
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:51,160
Get me a bottle of water.

170
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:52,800
Let me get it.

171
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:02,900
How much is the salary in your internet cafe?

172
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:04,820
Are they still hiring?

173
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:07,580
I am not your peer.

174
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:10,380
Call me if you need anything.

175
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:17,360
   

176
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:25,160
I‘ll go to the new district first and bully a noob.

177
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:27,160
Let's have some fun first.

178
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:41,400
 Be careful, everyone. 

179
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:45,520
 Fighting monsters alone will get you a lot of good materials. 

180
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,560
Have you three played this before?

181
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,380
Wasn't this server just launched?

182
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:51,740
I'm still not familiar with this now.

183
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:54,500
I was kicked out as soon as I entered the dungeon.

184
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:56,620
Here comes three noobs.

185
00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:58,740
I will make you miserable then.

186
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:01,820
Okay. You three can follow my lead.

187
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:04,860
Isn't the Midnight Phantom Cat just a wild cat?

188
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:06,620
A wild cat?

189
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:08,860
The cat is bigger than the three of us combined.

190
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:10,140
It beat us with one claw.

191
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:13,000
It's because you don't know how to aggro*. 
  (*Short for "aggravation" or "aggressive") 

192
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:18,560
For example, if I slap you now,

193
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:21,580
won't you hate me so much that you'd chase me to hit me?

194
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:24,140
This time he slaps you ten more times.

195
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:27,020
Won't you hate him even more and chase him so you can hit him back?

196
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:28,720
This is what aggro means.

197
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:31,580
Whoever deals more AD* will be the target of the monster. 
  (*Attack Damage value to a character) 

198
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:33,680
The others don't have to worry about being attacked by the monster anymore.

199
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,480
If we just go and fight the monster, it will be a mess.

200
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,581
The Midnight Phantom Cat was supposed to attack me, but it ended up attacking other people.

201
00:13:38,581 --> 00:13:40,260
In the end, it becomes an overthreat*. 
  (*Team disruption strategy) 

202
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:42,000
Got it?

203
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:44,060
 Got it. Understood. 

204
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:47,121
I've been talking for a while now. Have you brought people in yet?

205
00:13:47,121 --> 00:13:50,421
Have you shouted out that we just need one Cleric to enter the dungeon?

206
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:08,380
   
   

207
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:12,340
 I am designing a weapon like this. 

208
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:13,940
 I call this the Myriad Manifestation Umbrella. 

209
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:15,120
 You're amazing! 

210
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:18,080
 Turns out you'd come up with the idea for a while but you've been keeping it from me? 

211
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,620
 It still lacks two items. 

212
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:22,560
 There are two forms that can't be switched arbitrarily. 

213
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,320
 After I finish the design, 

214
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,840
 prepare to overwhelm your opponents, gain an advantage in tournaments, 

215
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:28,080
 - and shock the world of Glory. 
 - Okay. 

216
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:32,020
 Then I'll look forward to the day the Myriad Manifestation Umbrella is made. 

217
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,260
 My research failed. 

218
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:37,700
 I've sealed off the Myriad Manifestation Umbrella. 

219
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:39,180
 Is it lacking some items? 

220
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:41,140
 I'm going to fight through all the dungeons and get the items. 

221
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:42,920
 Wait for me. 

222
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:50,320
 Anyone interested in teaming up? 

223
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,500
 Have you teamed up yet? 

224
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:55,640
You need a Cleric, right?

225
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:58,800
Count me in.

226
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:03,660
   

227
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:06,420
This one has a decent ATK.

228
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:07,800
He should be able to aggro easily.

229
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:10,240
Let you be the first to be taken away.

230
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,300
This...

231
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:16,220
I'll let you be the second one who goes into hell.

232
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:21,420
The third one... will be you.

233
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:26,260
The Cleric. He has to be the last one to die.

234
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:27,960
Never mind. I don't care whether you die or not.

235
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,660
I am in such a bad mood.

236
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:33,120
The reward from the dungeon belongs to me.

237
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:36,200
Let's go.

238
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,210
   

239
00:15:52,210 --> 00:15:54,180
   

240
00:15:54,185 --> 00:15:56,000
   

241
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:39,840
The Midnight Phantom Cat is here.

242
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:07,861
Knight, hit it!

243
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:11,360
Sharpshooter, shoot it! Shoot it!

244
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:20,000
Everybody, help out! Help out!

245
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,320
Thief, attack quickly!

246
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:24,320
Knight, hold up for a while.

247
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:32,960
Heal him. Don't you see his HP is getting low?

248
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:36,230
   

249
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:38,800
   

250
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:41,920
   

251
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:48,401
Lord Grim, are you pretending to be stupid or what?

252
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:56,680
Add some HP!

253
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,930
   

254
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:14,500
Lord Grim, heal the Sharpshooter!

255
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:17,220
Heal the Sharpshooter!

256
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:21,560
Lord Grim, what's wrong with you?

257
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:23,160
 Can't you see he's almost out of HP? 

258
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:25,040
 Heal him! 

259
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:32,980
What the hell? Bro. Heal!

260
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:34,260
I can't.

261
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:35,620
If I do, I'll become an overthreat.

262
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:36,960
Listen to me and heal him!

263
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,560
I'm pulling the aggro, what are you afraid of?

264
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:41,261
If you make a mistake and can't pull the aggro,

265
00:18:41,261 --> 00:18:44,400
the Midnight Phantom Cat will go after me, just like it did with those three.

266
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,320
Are you setting me up on purpose?

267
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,500
You want to pocket the reward without sharing.

268
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,940
Isn't that your goal?

269
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:52,340
The reward for completing the dungeon quest is worth a lot.

270
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:55,621
It's not worth sharing them with noobs who are getting boosted.

271
00:18:55,621 --> 00:18:58,240
You made a plan from the very beginning.

272
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:00,860
Use them to reduce the Midnight Phantom Cat's HP.

273
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:03,120
Let them be the targets of Midnight Phantom Cat.

274
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:07,180
I have to say this is a clever move.

275
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:08,640
Only the two of us are left now.

276
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:09,980
How about working together to kill the Midnight Phantom Cat?

277
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:11,620
I will give you half of the reward.

278
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:13,620
Half?

279
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:14,621
I prefer to take it all.

280
00:19:14,621 --> 00:19:16,600
You're crazy! If I'm dead, you won't live either.

281
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:17,721
Midnight Phantom Cat has already reached the Enraged stage.

282
00:19:17,721 --> 00:19:19,340
You can't handle it alone.

283
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:21,160
In this way, no one will get the reward.

284
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,460
 You're an idiot! Lord Grim! 

285
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:24,540
I will remember you!

286
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:27,340
Do you know how strong our Full Moon Guild is?

287
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:29,800
You're finished!

288
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:36,480
You want to solo kill the Midnight Phantom Cat.

289
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:39,101
You're only a Cleric. Let's see how you‘re going to kill it.

290
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:47,210
   
 (*Combat Power) 

291
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,480
 Congratulations to Players Sleeping Moon, 

292
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,500
 Lord Grim, One Shot Through, 

293
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:20,180
 Shield Walker, and Assassin. 

294
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:23,280
 They're the first team to successfully finish the Green Forest dungeon quest. 

295
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:24,780
 - First kill. First kill. 
 - The first kill in the new server. 

296
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:25,960
 Grandmaster, add me to your friend list. 

297
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,200
 First kill! First kill! First kill! 

298
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,780
 All rise and show your respect to the Grandmaster. 

299
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:31,220
 A master in the making. A master of a master in the making. 

300
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:32,960
Impossible!

301
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:37,400
Lord Grim. Lord Grim.

302
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,520
Lord Grim!

303
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,300
How dare you steal the first kill.

304
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,820
Do you think I'm a pushover!

305
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:46,450
   

306
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:49,240
Hello.

307
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:52,300
Hello, Director Cao.

308
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:54,780
Yes, it's me, Chang.

309
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:58,540
News article?

310
00:21:58,540 --> 00:22:00,080
I will send the article to you tonight.

311
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:03,880
I have already come up with the headline. It is...

312
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:06,020
"Shocking! Excellent Era Changed the Color of Their Uniform"

313
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:08,120
"Maple leaves are no longer redder than February flowers*." 
  (*Means something huge has happened) 

314
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:09,661
What do you think?

315
00:22:09,661 --> 00:22:11,800
Not good? I have another one.

316
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:13,620
It's called "Why are the Flowers so Red*?

317
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:16,320
Because they are contrasted by green leaves."

318
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:18,740
Team Tiny Herb will not be happy about that?

319
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:20,700
Then...

320
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:22,780
All right, I will go back immediately.

321
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:24,440
I'll get back at you next time.

322
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:31,960
   

323
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:40,360
   

324
00:22:43,970 --> 00:22:47,310
   
   

325
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:56,240
Mu Qiu, no matter how rare the materials are and

326
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:58,740
how difficult it is to upgrade, 
    

327
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:03,880
 I will do everything I can to revive your masterpiece. 

328
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:08,270
 I shall take it with me to the peak of Glory. 

329
00:23:08,270 --> 00:23:12,170
   

330
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,320
What the hell?

331
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:20,600
Admin! Admin!

332
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,760
Boss!

333
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:29,320
I'm sorry.

334
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:40,460
Bastard.

335
00:23:46,210 --> 00:23:49,200
   

336
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:54,400
I can see the Grandmaster again.

337
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:05,520
Did he really retire just like that? You're not going to wait for him to change his mind?

338
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:08,160
I mean, what if he comes back?

339
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:09,480
You don't believe in yourself.

340
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:11,440
Or you don't believe in me?

341
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:14,160
What if people ask about this?

342
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:17,840
What if they think I am the reason he chose to retire? They will think I forced him—

343
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:20,780
They will say you drove away Excellent Era's top player.

344
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:23,520
That's good.

345
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:27,400
Take it as a blatant compliment. Just let them talk.

346
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:29,500
You call this a blatant compliment?

347
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:30,680
Being able to drive away the strongest player in the league

348
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:32,400
means you are stronger than him.

349
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,120
As long as most people accept you,

350
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:37,800
the opinions of the minority will not matter.

351
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:41,960
How many people do you think will care about someone who's a thing of the past?

352
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,580
Will the announcement be received without issue?

353
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:54,821
You're so nervous. You think you are inferior to Ye Qiu

354
00:24:54,821 --> 00:24:56,720
and can't be the captain of Excellent Era?

355
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:58,620
Or do you think you're unworthy of One Autumn Leaf

356
00:24:58,620 --> 00:24:59,840
or the title of Battle Grandmaster?

357
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:01,660
I certainly do not think that way.

358
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:07,700
Do you want people to say things like this?

359
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:09,420
Of course not.

360
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:13,220
If you don't do a great job, they will say so sooner or later.

361
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:17,040
If you don't want this to happen,

362
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:19,360
show everyone your true strength.

363
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:22,480
You are the captain of Excellent Era.

364
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:26,080
Ye Qiu. In a few months,

365
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:29,010
people will forget about someone who retired.

366
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:31,040
   

367
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:32,980
- Why are you here again? Get out. 
 - I am a reporter.

368
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:34,440
- Get out. 
 - Excuse me. Excuse me.

369
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:36,380
- The flowers will arrive soon. 
 - Who are you?

370
00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:38,060
We need to give the flowers to our boss. It's urgent.

371
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:40,460
- Get in. 
 - Thank you.

372
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:45,961
Who are you?

373
00:25:45,961 --> 00:25:48,240
I'm here to deliver the flowers. Chairman Tao is waiting for them.

374
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:50,880
- Go, go. 
 - Hurry up.

375
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:55,280
The scene is all set.

376
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:58,240
Three, two, one. Start.

377
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:00,120
Dear audience, hello.

378
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:03,001
Welcome to the press conference of the Excellent Era Club.

379
00:26:03,001 --> 00:26:05,720
Next, let's give a big round of applause

380
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:08,320
to the owner of Excellent Era Club, Tao Xuan.

381
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:12,900
He will tell us about the new plans and strategies for the team.

382
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:15,480
 Hello, everyone. I'm Tao Xuan. 

383
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:19,440
 I'm honored to meet so many people who support Team Excellent Era today 

384
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,200
 and communicate with them. 

385
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:23,901
 Your enthusiasm touches me a lot. 

386
00:26:23,901 --> 00:26:26,960
 At the same time, it makes me feel ashamed. 

387
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:32,100
 I am going to announce something unfortunate to you in this press conference. 

388
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:36,500
The Textbook of Glory, our beloved captain,

389
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:42,980
Ye Qiu, decided to step down as captain a few days ago.

390
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:48,780
 About Ye Qiu's retirement as captain, as his boss— 

391
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:18,160
 He really left. 

392
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:23,080
 We all know 

393
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:26,600
 league-battle levels in Glory are rising dramatically. 

394
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:28,500
 The intensity of competition is getting stronger. 

395
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:31,000
 Players need to spend 80 hours a week to practice. 

396
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:35,980
 This exhausted the old players physically and mentally, and put them under great mental pressure. 

397
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:37,600
 - The club.  
 - How dare he.

398
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:41,820
 I tried to persuade Ye Qiu to help the team as a consultant. 

399
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:45,140
 Unfortunately, Ye Qiu has made up his mind. 

400
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:48,460
 We deeply regret his leaving. 

401
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:49,820
 But still, 

402
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:55,080
 we will give 100% respect and understanding to our ex-captain. 

403
00:27:57,660 --> 00:27:59,840
Boss, I am so sorry.

404
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:02,220
I accidentally dropped some water on the floor.

405
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:04,540
It makes me mad.

406
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:16,680
How about I pay 5 RMB for that?

407
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:20,160
Money is useless.

408
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,920
It can't bring back my Grandmaster.

409
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:24,640
 As a veteran, 

410
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:28,900
 Ye Qiu has accompanied Glory for ten full years. 

411
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:31,520
 For many people, including me, 

412
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:36,840
 Ye Qiu is the legend of our era. 

413
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:38,660
I will never get the chance to see Ye Qiu again.

414
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:41,900
 He won three glorious championships for Excellent Era. 

415
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:45,080
Strictly speaking, Ye Qiu is the one who retired,

416
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:48,740
but One Autumn Leaf is still with Excellent Era.

417
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:54,160
But One Autumn Leaf without Ye Qiu is like an empty shell without a soul.

418
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:56,640
 Ye Qiu's retirement is regrettable. 

419
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,880
 However, Excellent Era needs to move on. 

420
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:01,300
Will I never see Ye Qiu again?

421
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:04,160
 His retirement doesn't represent the end of a legend. 

422
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:06,160
You're the least qualified person to say that now.

423
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:08,680
 He just handed over his legacy 

424
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:11,640
 to the developing next generation of players. 

425
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:14,621
 The one who will carry on his legacy is 

426
00:29:14,621 --> 00:29:17,640
- Move. I can't see. 
  - is a new player in our professional league. 

427
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:18,980
 Sun Xiang. 

428
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:23,720
 Sun Xiang! Sun Xiang! 

429
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:28,120
Get me my computer, kiddo.

430
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,340
- Where is it? 
 - At the bar.

431
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:37,020
 It's an honor to take the baton from Ye Qiu and 

432
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:40,900
 serve as the new captain of Excellent Era. 

433
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:42,460
 On the very day Ye Qiu left... 

434
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:46,240
A mere rookie champion wants to replace Ye Qiu?

435
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:48,120
It's still too early for him.

436
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:52,400
The account was handed over to me with some instructions from my senior.

437
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:54,420
 Do you like eSports? 

438
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:56,200
 What? 

439
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:57,760
 If you like it, 

440
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:02,400
 consider all of this as glory, not as an opportunity to show off. 

441
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:08,580
He said to consider all of this as glory, not as an opportunity to show off.

442
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:10,200
Then, why are you showing off?

443
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:14,340
 We will come up with a new strategy in the shortest possible time 

444
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:16,700
 to usher in a new Excellent Era. 

445
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:19,080
Someone says I am rude.

446
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:21,220
Then I'll show you what rudeness really looks like.

447
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:22,560
 There are so many bullet screen comments. 

448
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:24,760
- Here comes the keyboard warrior. 
  - Everyone is interacting with you. 

449
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:29,280
 Captain Sun Xiang, you just took over the position of captain from Ye Qiu. 

450
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:33,500
 Are you confident that you can do the job well? 

451
00:30:34,621 --> 00:30:39,380
 In other words, can you be just as good as Ye Qiu? 

452
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:41,440
 Just as good? 

453
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:43,701
 If that's all I want, 

454
00:30:43,701 --> 00:30:46,620
 I wouldn't have signed the transfer contract. 

455
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:50,480
 Ten years ago, the current major teams 

456
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:51,981
 don't even have a prototype. 

457
00:30:51,981 --> 00:30:55,680
 Indeed. That's how Excellent Era got the title as the best team in Glory. 

458
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:58,281
 - First— 
 - No, what I want to say is 

459
00:30:58,281 --> 00:31:02,300
 if the treble* that year entered the current league, 
 (*Team's 3-tournament win in 1 season) 

460
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:05,180
 they may not have even made it to 3rd place. 

461
00:31:05,180 --> 00:31:06,680
 This is the reality. 

462
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:08,300
 Strong teams and strong players continuously emerge. 

463
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:10,640
 If you are still immersed in past achievements, 

464
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:13,320
 your progress will become slower and slower 

465
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:16,720
 until you are eventually left behind. 

466
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:21,260
 Since I have chosen to accept this glory as the captain of Excellent Era, 

467
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:24,020
 I have only one goal. 

468
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:27,520
 From now on, when people talk about Excellent Era, 

469
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:29,760
 they will no longer mention the treble of that year, 

470
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:33,280
 but the current number 1 team. 

471
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:37,400
One Autumn Leaf belongs to Ye Qiu.

472
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:41,520
 Good job! 

473
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:42,620
 Well done! 

474
00:31:42,620 --> 00:31:45,080
That was so exciting.

475
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:47,960
Actually, he is right.

476
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:51,240
What do you mean?

477
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:54,360
Old players retire and newcomers emerge.

478
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:56,980
It is the law of nature. No one can change it.

479
00:31:56,980 --> 00:31:58,840
Say it again.

480
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:00,400
However,

481
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:05,920
being old players doesn't mean they will be deserters.

482
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:09,520
Being newcomers doesn't mean they're invincible.

483
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:12,680
In the world of Glory,

484
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:15,720
there is no such thing as noobs or veterans.

485
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:21,040
Yeah.

486
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:23,360
In the world of Glory...

487
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:28,830
In the world of Glory, there is only our love for this game.

488
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:35,760
 Ye Qiu no longer exists in the League, 

489
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:40,440
 but Excellent Era and One Autumn Leaf will still dominate the League. 

490
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:46,160
No one can tell until they fight.

491
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:57,800
Right. You won't know until you fight.

492
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:16,600
Empty eyes. Slow movements.

493
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:18,760
How long has it been since I saw you?

494
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:21,240
This is how you gave up on yourself.

495
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:23,900
I finally realized that in this world,

496
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:26,400
there are things more difficult than playing Glory.

497
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,940
So you are not giving up on yourself?

498
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:34,760
You want a new start.

499
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:39,200
I probably won't be able to make a comeback successfully.

500
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:44,600
I brought the things you didn't take.

501
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:54,340
Did you watch the live broadcast?

502
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:57,800
Watching half of it already made me furious.

503
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:59,600
So I just turned it off.

504
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:04,100
Don't watch it anymore.

505
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:09,900
Are you worried that I may not be able to stand it?

506
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:13,700
I'm worried that Sun Xiang won't be able to stand it in the future.

507
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:32,780
My partner knows me the best.

508
00:34:44,130 --> 00:34:50,250
   
   

509
00:34:50,950 --> 00:34:53,680
 The guild leader got the first kill for the Midnight Phantom Cat yesterday. 

510
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:54,880
 When did he become this powerful? 

511
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:56,320
 It looks like the guild leader is boosted. 

512
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:57,800
 He got help from a grandmaster. 

513
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:59,580
 Yes, everyone was dead. 

514
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:01,260
 He was the last one standing. 

515
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:02,700
 I heard he relied on Lord Grim. 

516
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:04,300
 He solo killed the big boss. 

517
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:07,580
- Lord Grim again. 
  - Who is this Lord Grim anyway? 

518
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:10,980
Another Sun Xiang, who has no respect for his predecessors.

519
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:14,180
As a journalist, I am obliged to expose your ugly side.

520
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:17,160
Lord Grim is so despicable. He wanted the hidden boss for himself.

521
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:19,020
So he deliberately did not heal the entire team.

522
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:20,880
 Watch out for him, everyone. 

523
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:23,740
 Lord Grim is so despicable. Just to get the boss for himself, 

524
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:25,920
 he purposefully didn't heal anyone and caused everyone to die. 

525
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:27,420
 Watch out for him, everyone. 

526
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:29,880
 Lord Grim is so despicable. Just to get the boss for himself, 

527
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:31,920
 so that he could have the reward from the hidden boss all to himself. 

528
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:34,100
 Watch out for him, everyone. 

529
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:36,400
Let's team up. Let's team up for a dungeon quest.

530
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:39,080
We are one person short.

531
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:41,920
Let's team up. Let's team up.

532
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:45,120
The grandmaster is joining.

533
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:49,500
What do you want?

534
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:53,600
I can't find anyone to team up with because of you.

535
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:56,060
Now you know your mistake, noob.

536
00:35:56,060 --> 00:35:58,300
You better learn from this.

537
00:35:58,300 --> 00:36:00,800
Respect those who are more experienced than you.

538
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,100
Understood?

539
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:04,200
You do have a temper.

540
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:07,860
How about this?

541
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:10,660
We know each other now.

542
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:11,960
Let me join you.

543
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:13,350
We can cooperate together.

544
00:36:13,350 --> 00:36:14,960
   

545
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:17,800
I won't let you off this easily.

546
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,700
 I think he really wants to cooperate with us. 

547
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:20,980
You believe him?

548
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:23,000
Sun Xiang even wants to surpass Ye Qiu.

549
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,700
 I know you are angry about Ye Qiu's retirement. 

550
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:28,700
Let him aggro the boss alone later.

551
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:32,120
None of us will help him. Let the Spider Emperor knock him around.

552
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:34,780
Only if you're willing to aggro.

553
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:40,700
What are you waiting for?

554
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:42,200
Let's go.

555
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:19,780
We're about to meet Spider Emperor.

556
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:21,560
I will go and provoke it.

557
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:24,420
Okay, we'll wait until you hold the aggro.

558
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:25,100
Come and work right now.

559
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:30,500
Come with me.

560
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:44,000
What kind of trap is this?

561
00:39:44,620 --> 00:39:46,900
Is he offline?

562
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:48,700
It's as simple as that?

563
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:50,100
What do you think?

564
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:53,860
He is pretending to run out of HP to let our guard down.

565
00:39:53,860 --> 00:39:56,500
Then he'll eat his word and do what he did last time.

566
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:59,340
Looks like you were greatly affected by what happened last time.

567
00:39:59,340 --> 00:40:03,481
This USB flash drive contains a collection of all the matches Ye Qiu played.

568
00:40:03,481 --> 00:40:06,520
Go and play it on the screen so everyone can watch.

569
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:12,700
Is this thing even working?

570
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:15,100
Of course it is.

571
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,600
Wait.

572
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:24,000
Did I also include the profile of my Grandmaster?

573
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,960
Wait. I need to check again.

574
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:30,360
Why do you need to see the face in the game highlight?

575
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:32,580
You don't understand.

576
00:40:32,580 --> 00:40:36,240
Someone who plays Glory well only has attractive techniques.

577
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:40,420
My Grandmaster, he also has charisma.

578
00:40:44,110 --> 00:40:48,100
   

579
