 "Light From the Ashes" - Cai Wei Ze 

2
00:00:02,260 --> 00:00:06,220
♫  Countless fireflies born from insignificance  ♫

3
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:10,150
♫  Riding the long wind to gather into a shining galaxy  ♫

4
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:14,000
♫  Proclaim to the world on top of the sky  ♫

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,970
♫  We will return in glory  ♫

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,800
♫  Clear the clouds and descend with the heat  ♫

7
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:27,420
♫  Melting ice and snow, overcoming twists and turns  ♫

8
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:31,190
♫  Finally at this moment of peak  ♫

9
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:35,340
♫  There is a figure that coincides with the past  ♫

10
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:39,070
♫  The glory of the past that never came  ♫

11
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:42,740
♫  The pride that the future will never pass  ♫

12
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:46,510
♫  Our fingertips intertwined and condensed  ♫

13
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:50,460
♫  Into a song that ignited the battlefield  ♫

14
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:54,210
♫  The only light in an endless night  ♫

15
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:57,980
♫  Is you and me who overcame mediocrity  ♫

16
00:00:57,980 --> 00:01:01,980
♫  Up on the clouds and down in the dust  ♫

17
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:05,820
♫  Fireflies making every effort to illuminate  ♫

18
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:09,690
♫  I came from the legend to carry on a legend  ♫

19
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:13,460
♫  Once it's disruptive, a decade of persistence won't be in vain  ♫

20
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:17,350
♫  Up on the clouds and down in the dust  ♫

21
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:21,140
♫  Fireflies making every effort to illuminate  ♫

22
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:24,940
♫  Fireflies making every effort to illuminate  ♫

23
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:28,200
   

24
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:32,900
   

25
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:42,120
- Thank you. 
 - You're welcome.

26
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:54,240
 Subtitles and Timing provided to you by💥🍥 TEAM 7️⃣ 🍥💥 @viki.com 

27
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,360
- Give it to me. 
 - Okay.

28
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,720
No drinking during the competition.

29
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,500
That's the rule.

30
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:02,100
But since you've started,

31
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,000
then you might as well enjoy yourself.

32
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:13,920
One more glass. The same as his, with ice cubes.

33
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,360
Here.

34
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:25,480
Diluting it with ice? So low.

35
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:31,900
The ice represses the light element in alcohol,

36
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:36,400
which brings out the stronger tasting elements.

37
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:43,400
Many times, it can have a result where one plus one is more than two.

38
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:46,060
I'm the unique one.

39
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:48,500
I don't need to team up with anyone anymore.

40
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:51,200
Of course not.

41
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,680
When genius players like you team up with others,

42
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,600
it's more favorable for others.

43
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,400
It's not fair.

44
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:09,600
You're so prominent, so everyone thinks that you should win.

45
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:12,100
If you lose, it's a shame.

46
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,900
They'll say you're an unprofessional captain.

47
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:21,360
But we all know that it was Team Excellent Era that had problems.

48
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:24,520
I don't care.

49
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:32,500
If really don't care, why are you sitting here instead of in the Tactical Room?

50
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:35,700
Don't think you can educate me after you beat me one time.

51
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:40,000
One day I'll knock you down hard.

52
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:45,280
It should be the two of us

53
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:52,461
who will someday knock the rest of the league down hard.

54
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,440
   

55
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,790
   

56
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:43,160
Our hardware has been upgraded.

57
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:46,820
But our enemy has also upgraded.

58
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:50,880
Judging from the team members, except for the captain,

59
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,820
we're all new players who haven't even played on the field.

60
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:56,320
As for weapons,

61
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:59,040
our orange equipment versus their sliver equipment,

62
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,420
I'm afraid that the DPS (kill value) is less than half of theirs.

63
00:05:03,261 --> 00:05:05,140
Luo Ji, How are the calculations going?

64
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:08,700
What is our winning rate against Excellent Era?

65
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:11,780
Eighty-eight?

66
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:15,640
Hey, buddy. That's so unreliable.

67
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:17,200
It really is 88%.

68
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,600
Based on all the data here,

69
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,200
we have nothing compared with Excellent Era.

70
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,000
Very wise.

71
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,720
It's true that we have nothing compared to Excellent Era.

72
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,790
But there's no need to compare.

73
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:34,300
As a captain, I only consider the possibility of winning.

74
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:36,320
There are only two cases in my opinion.

75
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,560
Win,

76
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,600
or lose.

77
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,800
Our winning rate

78
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,460
is the same as that of Excellent Era.

79
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:48,700
Well... that's not scientific.

80
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:52,000
If we base it on the data, that should be all of us..

81
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,360
ESports Competition is not just about data.

82
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:57,740
It's the person behind the account that is the biggest variable.

83
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:03,660
Sounds like a trick, but I have to say that he really has a good point.

84
00:06:04,541 --> 00:06:07,640
Captain, let's begin training now.

85
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:10,400
Fighting, fighting, beat Excellent Era.

86
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,800
Oh, by the way. The boss wants you to know something.

87
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:19,120
Pay attention to your appearance when you sign up tomorrow.

88
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,900
In...in what way?

89
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,800
In her opinion, I suppose...

90
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,500
Just dress to fit your professional status.

91
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,600
Professional status...

92
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,720
Go on about your business.

93
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:34,980
Okay.

94
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:36,920
- Let's go. 
 - Let's go.

95
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:42,500
How do I look?

96
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:45,760
Do I look very professional in this suit?

97
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:48,600
Do I look like a ranger?

98
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,900
Who are you?

99
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:57,460
Wait. One more thing.

100
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:05,100
Where are you guys going? Wait for me.

101
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,300
He's yours.

102
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:17,160
Bao Zi. Tang Rou said he is more handsome than you.

103
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:21,400
Is that guy your friend?

104
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:24,020
I don't know him.

105
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:26,961
Boss, don't I look professional?

106
00:07:26,961 --> 00:07:30,540
 The eighth Glory Professional Alliance has finished. 

107
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:32,580
 Samsara guild won the championship. 

108
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:35,560
 It was ordinary, but there were some regrets. 

109
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,950
 Compared with when I left Excellent Era, 

110
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:39,780
 the degradation of Excellent Era made me feel worse. 

111
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:41,900
 After all, that's where I once fought. 

112
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:45,100
 But now, I just focus on Team Happy. 

113
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:46,860
 Team Happy is a new team. 

114
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:49,400
 First, we must pass the layers of selection of the Tutor Selection 

115
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:52,500
 to qualify for the challenge competition, and win the championship, 

116
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:55,720
 Only then can we get tickets to the tenth Glory Professional Alliance. 

117
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,440
 This is a new start. 

118
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:00,260
 It means new hope. 

119
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,900
 Let's do this, Team Happy. 

120
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,500
I have something else to do. You guys go sign up.

121
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:15,830
So many people.

122
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:19,460
You say we're going to take part in the best, the most powerful selection?

123
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:22,160
Bao "know nothing" Rongxing,

124
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,560
Since it's a tutor selection,

125
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:26,280
It must be the most elementary competition.

126
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:28,920
Many teams come and sign up every year.

127
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:32,140
Only the top twenty teams selected by the tutors are qualified

128
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:34,500
to participate in the Formal Selection Challenge.

129
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,800
So there are tutors?

130
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:39,600
A tutor team is not a normal team,

131
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:42,820
Tyrannical Ambition, Blue Rain, Tiny Herb, and Samsara guilds,

132
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:46,280
Every year, a team from the League serves as tutors.

133
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:50,640
It's not easy to score well from them and get promoted.

134
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:54,320
It could be said that the selection is a high wall.

135
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:57,140
Sounds so complicated, but actually it's very easy.

136
00:08:57,140 --> 00:08:59,680
Ignore the tutors, just focus on the rank.

137
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:02,360
Twenty teams are eventually selected from among these teams.

138
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:04,060
Even closing your eyes, we're in.

139
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:06,060
Let's go.

140
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:09,100
Assassin from Zhu Xian,

141
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:11,080
APM master. APM 410.

142
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:13,461
He used to play three combo attacks in one second in a game.

143
00:09:13,461 --> 00:09:15,200
People called him "Hurricane Hand".

144
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,600
APM 410.

145
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,620
Impressive.

146
00:09:21,301 --> 00:09:23,980
- This way. 
 - Don't be nervous during the game.

147
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:25,320
Line up.

148
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,800
Competition is about participation.

149
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,100
I recall someone had trembling hands tremble last time.

150
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:31,750
Don't you dare say that again. I'll spray you.

151
00:09:32,441 --> 00:09:33,400
So quick.

152
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,840
- What are you doing? 
 - I'll be darned.

153
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,740
That's the first operator of Great Gunner who plays Cloud Piercer,

154
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:37,810
Has an extremely fast reaction speed.

155
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:40,180
The reaction speed of ordinary people is usually about 0.2 seconds.

156
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:42,660
He only needs 0.09 seconds.

157
00:09:44,321 --> 00:09:46,400
Well, let's fill out the form.

158
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,520
I just saw a place over there. Let's go.

159
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:50,640
Let's go.

160
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:55,800
Hey, watch out. It's lucky you to run into me.

161
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:59,220
You'd be blackmailed if you ran into someone else.

162
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,260
Sorry.

163
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:04,681
I'm sorry. So sorry.

164
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:10,000
Such a silly dude, with a dull brain,

165
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,160
I'll easily beat him.

166
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,940
It seems like that was Wu Chen, captain of Team Everlasting.

167
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:21,960
Wu Chen. Captain of Team Everlasting.

168
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,720
He led the team in games during Season 5.

169
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:25,640
He has plenty of practical experience and excellent management ability.

170
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:27,040
He's good at using weaknesses to become strong.

171
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,820
He led Team Everlasting to winning fifteen games,

172
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:30,620
when there was zero percent chance of winning.

173
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:32,880
- Many call him the Reversal God. 
 - Seriously?

174
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:36,041
The strength of each of these teams should not be underestimated.

175
00:10:36,041 --> 00:10:40,200
If we want to have a chance among these twenty teams,

176
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:43,480
then our chances of winning are probably...

177
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:45,360
Oh..enough, enough.

178
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,720
You always praise others, lift their spirits, and lower ours.

179
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,700
Let me tell you, our boss is even better.

180
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:53,300
He's responsible for the name "Textbook of Glory".

181
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:57,100
Tutor Selection? It's not yet sure who will guide whom.

182
00:10:57,100 --> 00:11:00,700
When you're making comparisons, that's when you remember your master.

183
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,480
That's right... where's the master?

184
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:12,400
   

185
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,380
Same venue, same people.

186
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:17,620
This scene really is a replica of past times.

187
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:21,920
It is indeed the same venue.

188
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,760
But the people are not.

189
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,540
True.

190
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:28,040
You're not the captain of Team Thunderclap,

191
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:30,600
who lost the game and threw everything away.

192
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:36,560
And you're not the captain of Excellent Era who won the game and lectured me.

193
00:11:38,370 --> 00:11:41,380
   

194
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:43,180
   

195
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:19,020
 This page is very clever concerning the tactics used against Tyrannical Ambition. 

196
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:21,140
 I'll take it for reference. 

197
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,460
 It's tactical analysis of Blue Rain is also here. 

198
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:34,960
 It's a pity that your Team Thunderclap couldn't realize your plans. 

199
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:42,680
 Looks like you dirty guys did work hard on these dirty tactics. 

200
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:47,000
 Work hard? 

201
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,180
 Do my best? 

202
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,560
 I might consider that a compliment 

203
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:57,280
 if I had heard such words a few years ago. 

204
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:02,020
 It's also a compliment now. 

205
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:10,300
 Talent is a necessity if you want to go down the eSports road. 

206
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:13,600
 But there is also a difference between talents. 

207
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:18,580
 And maybe that difference can't be bridged by hard work. 

208
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:20,080
 So, 

209
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:23,500
 "hard work" now sounds a little ironic. 

210
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:29,720
 For most people, working hard is the only option. 

211
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:32,460
 It has nothing to do with talent. 

212
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:38,360
 It's so arrogant of you geniuses to say that. 

213
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:41,240
 There aren't that many geniuses 

214
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:46,580
 Those extraordinary people just work hard in an ordinary way 

215
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:49,180
 in places that you can't see. 

216
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:54,000
 Quantitative changes to qualitative changes. 

217
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,500
 Who knows?  Maybe it was the very last trembling effort that made the difference. 

218
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:09,621
 It looks like I'll have to beat you the next time we meet. 

219
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:13,480
 Or I will be unworthy of not only my own efforts, 

220
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:18,420
 but also of you deliberately coming here to say those words to me. 

221
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:24,100
 Just finish the last pages first. 

222
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:28,680
It seems that the tactics book has been completed.

223
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:30,460
Good results.

224
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:32,500
You've fulfilled your promise.

225
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:34,900
You beat Excellent Era with Team Thunderclap.

226
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,080
But I haven't defeated you yet.

227
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:49,220
I heard you've made some important news recently.

228
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:51,040
Just transferred to another team.

229
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:53,920
The most common news in the league.

230
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:00,920
I'm afraid your transfer this time is unusual.

231
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:07,200
This so-called 'unusual' depends on who says it.

232
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,120
- Here. 
 - Okay.

233
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:20,620
Mucheng.

234
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:23,160
- Mucheng, Mucheng. 
 - Is that her?

235
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:26,080
What are you doing here?

236
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,880
I'm asking you.

237
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:29,600
Didn't you hear?

238
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,800
Are you deaf?

239
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,800
Are you doing cosplay?

240
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:39,341
Your Team Happy can just play out here during the selections.

241
00:15:39,341 --> 00:15:42,080
So don't hold any hope.

242
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:46,960
Any team in this hall could knock you down.

243
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,360
Who's that guy?

244
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,360
He talks so much.

245
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:51,820
So annoying.

246
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:54,540
Number 1 team member Shen Jian from Team Excellent Era.

247
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:56,480
What?  Say that again.

248
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,140
Shen Jian.

249
00:15:58,860 --> 00:15:59,921
Truly shen jian.  

250
00:15:59,921 --> 00:16:01,730
What did you say?

251
00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:04,260
   

252
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:17,480
Shen Jian.

253
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:20,020
One of the main players in our Excellent Era, the number one team.

254
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:23,940
He's been with Excellent Era since Season 5.

255
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:26,460
Participated in seventy-eight games.

256
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:31,580
The highest DPS was once 32% of the whole team.

257
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:36,380
He's among the top three strikers in the league.

258
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:38,760
What... What now?

259
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:41,940
I, the famous Glory rookie, Bao Rongxing,

260
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:44,040
have broken 1800 bricks,

261
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:46,941
Ive thrown more sand than is in the Sahara Desert.

262
00:16:46,941 --> 00:16:49,860
If you want to compare data, I'm not afraid of you.

263
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:53,820
Young man, you know nothing.

264
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:58,320
Our Excellent Era's captain is 'Best Rookie', Sun Xiang,

265
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:02,340
Top Launcher of the League, Su Mucheng.

266
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:04,200
Who do you have?

267
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:07,020
You don't even have enough players.

268
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:10,100
Buddy, teach them a lesson.

269
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:14,621
Hello, my name is Luo Ji.

270
00:17:14,621 --> 00:17:17,160
My operations and skills are the worst in our team.

271
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:20,640
But I'm familiar with everything about all of you here.

272
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,160
And if there's no accident,

273
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:26,581
my analysis of you should be more thorough than yours.

274
00:17:26,581 --> 00:17:28,100
Nice.

275
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:30,541
- Very good. 
 - Anything else?

276
00:17:30,541 --> 00:17:31,640
Do you have anyone else?

277
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:32,940
Yes.

278
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:36,600
Rookie Tang Rou, 163 days of contact with Glory,

279
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,920
20 days after opening his account, he's reached the full level.

280
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:42,400
68 games battling with Team Tiny Herb in the arena.

281
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,400
His winning rate is zero.

282
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:47,400
Went to the Glory Professional Alliance for the first time two days ago.

283
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,160
So what?

284
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:52,120
You are all standing at this starting point like me.

285
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:54,280
Well said.

286
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,600
Anyone else?

287
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,000
Anyone else or not?

288
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,080
Me.

289
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:00,920
You don't have to introduce yourself.

290
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:03,200
Former Tiny Herb professional manager

291
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:08,020
who was beaten cruelly in the last All-Star Game.

292
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:09,840
Manager?

293
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:13,400
Manager of water.

294
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:16,820
Boss.

295
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:24,540
Vice Captain of Excellent Era, Xiao Shiqin.

296
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:37,920
Vice Captain of Team Happy, Qiao Yifan.

297
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:40,840
Team Happy and Team Excellent Era may meet again.

298
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:44,660
If there's anything to say, let's say it in the arena.

299
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:46,180
Yifan,

300
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:49,360
the result of the tutor selection is still half an hour away.

301
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:53,081
You've dragged us here to look at an empty screen for an hour.

302
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:56,000
That's right, Yifan.

303
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,280
Is it fun to attack dungeons?

304
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:00,120
Isn't it more exciting to fight to the finish?

305
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:03,060
Is it exciting to throw bricks around?

306
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:05,820
Why are we wasting time here?

307
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:07,160
Let's go. Let's go back.

308
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:08,940
Move.

309
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:12,260
Abnormal behavior...there's only one explanation.

310
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:13,560
Fear.

311
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:16,220
Yifan. Are you afraid?

312
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,740
Instead of waiting for Murphy's Law,

313
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:22,180
it's better for us to take the initiative.

314
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:24,180
What's Murphy's Law?

315
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:25,640
The fourth law of Murphy's Law is that

316
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:27,600
if you're worried about something happening,

317
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:30,160
it's more likely to happen.

318
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,000
So how do we take the initiative?

319
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,700
Normally speaking, if we are not afraid anything,

320
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:37,600
there will be relatively good results.

321
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:39,400
Would I be afraid?

322
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:41,300
Do I need to be afraid?

323
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:44,220
I...

324
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:47,100
Am I afraid?

325
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:49,040
Yes.

326
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,740
Since all of us are not afraid,

327
00:19:55,740 --> 00:20:00,180
then the result doesn't matter, right?

328
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:02,820
Then, let's go back and take a break.

329
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:04,400
Let's go.

330
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,280
Go.

331
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,620
Finally.

332
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:39,460
No way.

333
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:41,800
Such a coincidence.

334
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:47,320
 Nothing to worry about, right, Yifan? 

335
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:48,890
 You aren't afraid, Tang Rou? 

336
00:20:48,890 --> 00:20:52,520
 Luo Ji, didn't you tell us not to be afraid? 

337
00:20:56,604 --> 00:20:58,475
 Shut up. 

338
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:00,281
 I second what Tang Rou said. 

339
00:21:00,281 --> 00:21:01,920
   

340
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:12,180
 Look, the Captain is offline. He is the one who isn't afraid. 

341
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:17,260
 He won't be affected by the opponents at all. I admire the captain. 

342
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:21,350
 -I admire the captain. 
 - I admire the captain. 

343
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:25,300
   

344
00:21:26,210 --> 00:21:28,270
   

345
00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:34,850
   

346
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:42,480
Team Tiny Herb.

347
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:46,760
 

348
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:23,940
All the star mentors in the Tutor Selection are familiar.

349
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:24,860
True.

350
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:27,400
It's much less difficult than the Alliance.

351
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:28,800
There will be no problem.

352
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,900
That's the reason that there is no need

353
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:34,420
for three All-Stars to be present at this level.

354
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:39,560
You mean that Sun Xiang and I don't have to play at the same time.

355
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:41,000
Exactly.

356
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,520
When Sun Xiang gets impulsive,

357
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:45,920
I'll ask him to go back; he can sit on the bench and calm down.

358
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:50,860
Then it's time for tacticians like you to play, take over control.

359
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:52,700
Sun Xiang and I are different types of players.

360
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:55,080
Excellent Era needs him and I at the same time.

361
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:56,460
You are new here.

362
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:58,620
You don't know much about our newcomer yet.

363
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:02,360
Young and aggressive, doesn't know how to obey, only knows how to attack.

364
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:06,180
It's not wise to talk about compatibility with such an impulsive person.

365
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:08,920
Impulse can also be an advantage.

366
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:11,180
Even though qualified players rarely make mistakes,

367
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:13,320
they also rarely create miracles.

368
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:15,770
I have designed a set of tactics with Sun Xiang as the core

369
00:23:15,770 --> 00:23:18,240
for the tutor selection.

370
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:22,460
I certainly believe in your tactics.

371
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:26,200
It's just that Sun Xiang will not make any changes

372
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:28,540
because of your addition to the team.

373
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:31,820
He's bound to be the weak link in your tactics.

374
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:35,460
What's going on?

375
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:40,100
I want to know your next tactical arrangement.

376
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:47,080
One Autumn Leaf is the tactic.

377
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:50,080
Fine.

378
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:55,040
Then let's work together to knock down the rest of the league.

379
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:05,960
Any weak link can be remedied, because we are professional players.

380
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:08,860
Victory is our common goal.

381
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:21,680
Tutor selection is different from the regular season.

382
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:24,880
There's no Individual Event, Arena Contest or Team Competition.

383
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,800
There is only one contest.

384
00:24:28,630 --> 00:24:31,500
   

385
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:35,220
The tutor team will intercept on this map.

386
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:37,130
We need to break through their barriers,

387
00:24:37,130 --> 00:24:39,560
running from one end of the map to the other.

388
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:42,480
One point for each player who crosses the line.

389
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:48,000
That's the rule.

390
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,480
Next, we should talk about how we should deal with it.

391
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:04,420
Team Tiny Herb is led by Vaccaria. He is best at debuff (negative power that weakens opponents).

392
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:06,520
which will greatly reduce our combat effectiveness.

393
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:10,460
Therefore, I think we need a cleric.

394
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:13,900
Are we that frightened?

395
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:15,580
Why do we need a Cleric to heal us?

396
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:17,740
The Cleric's main purpose is for healing,

397
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:21,280
but this time, we need his ability to clear the debuff.

398
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:27,100
I have a video here.

399
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:31,320
Let's take a look at how the Cleric clears the debuff.

400
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:47,600
Wang Jiexi and Gao Yingjie can both release debuff,

401
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:50,740
causing us all kinds of reduced effects.

402
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:54,150
This causes our combat effectiveness to drop sharply.

403
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:57,220
We really do need a special person to disperse them.

404
00:25:57,220 --> 00:26:01,960
Yifan, are you really not afraid to face Tiny Herb?

405
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:04,580
Tiny Herb...

406
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:07,140
It's fine.

407
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:09,200
At least I'm familiar with them.

408
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:28,200
Why are you guys here?

409
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:31,500
Never judge people by their appearance.

410
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:33,960
Our Yifan usually seems quite optimistic.

411
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:37,540
But deep inside, he's evil-minded.

412
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:40,380
I...no.

413
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:44,740
I'd like to see how bad you can be.

414
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:49,620
- Bao Zi. 
 - Xiao Tang, catch.

415
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:51,500
Tang Rou.

416
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:52,700
Tang Rou. Bro.

417
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:54,680
- Luo Ji. 
 - Give it back to me.

418
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:55,680
Team Tiny Herb.

419
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:58,481
Some offensive skills can be used to debuff enemy characters.

420
00:26:58,481 --> 00:27:01,521
Debuff is a state of diminution imposed on the enemy's character.

421
00:27:01,521 --> 00:27:04,121
It can temporarily reduce the enemy's role attributes, skills, etc.,

422
00:27:04,121 --> 00:27:06,960
causing their decline in combat effectiveness.

423
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,220
Tang Rou!

424
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:11,360
Secret weapons are already prepared.

425
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:22,680
Yifan.

426
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:27,040
Good job.

427
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:31,100
Captain, this is the ranking of the entire network's clerics.

428
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,300
I'll do it myself.

429
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:46,600
Captain, what do think about this one?

430
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:48,900
Although he's not at the top of the list,

431
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:51,420
his power of clearing debuff is the strongest.

432
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:54,370
I think he would be very suitable for our team.

433
00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:58,600
Don't choose the best, but the right one.

434
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:00,560
Your train of thought is clear.

435
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:03,220
Have you found him?

436
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:05,520
His name is An Wenyi.  He is a new graduate.

437
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:07,920
I'm thinking that if he plays the Cleric,

438
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:11,960
he might be easygoing, and very likely to fit in with us.

439
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:15,020
His ID nickname is "Cold Hands".

440
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:16,640
Then let's try him.

441
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:20,600
Warm his cool hands with our passion.

442
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:22,480
Yes, captain.

443
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:28,240
Oh right, captain, This is the personal data of An Wenyi.

444
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:30,240
I've highlighted all the key points.

445
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:33,641
Moreover, this is the latest recruitment for all the teams.

446
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:40,080
Captain, this is some interview skills I searched yesterday,

447
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:43,420
I hope it helps.

448
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:53,840
So well prepared...

449
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:57,360
Why don't you go and interview him?

450
00:28:58,060 --> 00:29:00,480
Me?

451
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:03,260
Could I?

452
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:05,000
Of course you can.

453
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:12,940
You are the vice captain.

454
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:25,620
Are you really want going to join Team Happy?

455
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:27,120
What else?

456
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:30,200
Well, there are only two months left so you can't stay long.

457
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:34,540
Then I'll use two months to make a quick buck. Isn't that a good idea?

458
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:36,900
Let me tell you. ESports is not just attacking Dungeons.

459
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:39,140
It's real action and weapons.

460
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:42,020
Why am I feeling that...

461
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:46,180
you are doubting me? Aren't you?

462
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:48,700
It's not that I doubt you.

463
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:50,820
You know your strengths and weaknesses, right?

464
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:54,461
Otherwise, you wouldn't ask me to come help you with this.

465
00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:00,760
Thanks.

466
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:03,700
   

467
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:05,720
As a gold medal substitute,

468
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:08,080
you are not that good.

469
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:10,260
Didn't we agree you would give me five books in exchange?

470
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:11,440
Junior brother,

471
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:15,220
we agreed that you would help me reach No.1.

472
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:18,900
I'm only No.10 now.

473
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:23,180
You deserve only three books.

474
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:26,700
Although the results were not as good as expected,

475
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:30,140
it was also affected by misfortune. Right?

476
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:33,200
And look. Now here's a team coming to you with an olive branch.

477
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:35,520
Please give me the whole set.

478
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:38,040
-No problem. 
 - Thanks a lot.

479
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:41,080
Don't you count your coffee as one of these?

480
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:42,480
Then I still have one more.

481
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:46,360
My coffee counts and that's five.

482
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:50,921
Hey, these books are no longer of any value to you.

483
00:30:50,921 --> 00:30:54,820
Look at this as part of our friendship.

484
00:30:54,820 --> 00:31:00,540
Let me ask you, how much is our friendship worth?

485
00:31:00,540 --> 00:31:02,020
You are so mean.

486
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:03,500
Why do I have a friend like you?

487
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:04,740
I want to break up with you.

488
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:05,940
Take care. I won't see you off.

489
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:07,900
Wait! I...

490
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:08,920
Fine.

491
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:11,740
I can't believe you can be part of a team.

492
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:14,780
You don't have to worry about that.

493
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:20,120
Not only can I join the team, but I can also raise my status.

494
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,750
We'll see.

495
00:31:26,750 --> 00:31:32,980
   

496
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:01,600
This property along with the turnover here must be pretty good.

497
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:11,100
Hello. Are you An Wenyi?

498
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:14,160
Yes, I am An Wenyi.

499
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:16,560
Go and tell your interviewer I'm here.

500
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:22,100
Hi.

501
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:24,060
I am...

502
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:25,980
the interviewer.

503
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:42,680
Is he the one you are looking for?

504
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:45,840
Cold Hands. His name is An Wenyi.

505
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:48,120
Why did you let Yifan do the interview?

506
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:49,940
Such an excellent vice captain,

507
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:52,720
it would be a pity if I didn't give him this opportunity

508
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,940
and make him take charge of it.

509
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:59,140
Watch out.

510
00:32:59,140 --> 00:33:01,040
Careful, it's hot.

511
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:14,420
 Interview skill No. 1, start with greetings, relieve the tension. 

512
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:24,160
Your resume says that your undergraduate major is Finance.

513
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:25,640
Yes.

514
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:31,200
But it didn't influence me to become an excellent Cleric.

515
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:35,080
Based on my abilities, it should be enough to be one of your team.

516
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:40,340
Not only that, I could be your team investment advisor.

517
00:33:40,340 --> 00:33:44,000
And of course, personal finance.

518
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:53,320
 Interview skill No. 2, don't rush to the point. 

519
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:58,440
 Leave the question to him, respond quickly according to the situation. 

520
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:04,960
What advantages do you think you have as a Cleric?

521
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:07,180
Talent is not like being pregnant.

522
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:09,380
It can't be discerned in just a second.

523
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:13,760
But if you're a person of good sense,

524
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:17,260
in a glance, you will be able to see if I'm suitable or not.

525
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:24,020
 Interview skill No. 3, Go to the point directly. 

526
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:29,180
So tell me about your records with Glory.

527
00:34:29,180 --> 00:34:31,360
Me?  I'm strongest when I meet strength.

528
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:35,820
The records depend on whether the team can make me play at a high level.

529
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:40,340
Your team has to rely on an internet cafe for support.

530
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:44,560
I'd better...

531
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:49,480
Although our team is small scale, we are professional.

532
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:51,840
Let me show you our training room.

533
00:35:02,860 --> 00:35:06,540
Do you have any other requirements?

534
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:14,240
Look, why do you seem so insincere?

535
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:22,800
In an interview, shouldn't you talk about the salary or something?

536
00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:29,300
Never mind. Time is money.

537
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:32,500
- You... 
 - You can request anything as long as you stay.

538
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:46,280
You mean that as long as my performance is good,

539
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:50,140
the salary can be increased. Right?

540
00:35:50,140 --> 00:35:51,860
No problem.

541
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:56,500
I can grant your request.

542
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:59,860
But whether you can get the contract depends on your performance.

543
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:01,600
Okay.

544
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:05,980
I'll play according to your rules.

545
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:08,250
Our rules are the rules for the tutor selection,

546
00:36:08,250 --> 00:36:10,880
which is running through the map.

547
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:13,340
You win if you cross the finish line.

548
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:15,900
You run and I'm in charge of interception.

549
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:19,500
If any one player crosses the line, it means I lose.

550
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:23,800
Let me see what on earth your abilities are.

551
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:27,000
   

552
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:37,660
   

553
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:53,260
Boss, you played a trick.

554
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:54,760
I'm not ready.

555
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:58,780
The opponent does not care whether you are ready or not on the arena.

556
00:36:58,780 --> 00:37:01,360
Tang Rou, go forward, suppress the captain, I'll support you.

557
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:03,480
Bao Zi, An Wenyi, look for opportunities to move forward.

558
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:05,721
- No problem. 
 - Got it.

559
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:17,880
It's not so easy to walk away.

560
00:37:23,260 --> 00:37:27,040
An Wenyi, eliminate all the captain's skills with Sacred Fire.

561
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:32,240
   

562
00:37:42,580 --> 00:37:44,300
  ] 

563
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:54,160
   

564
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:56,080
Thanks.

565
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:58,840
No need. I just gave you a little bit. So mean.

566
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:01,180
It's lucky that you're still alive.

567
00:38:01,180 --> 00:38:03,100
Nice timing.

568
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:04,820
Of course.

569
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:14,940
Why don't you cancel my debuff?

570
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:19,741
You are too weak. It's such a waste cancelling your debuff.

571
00:38:19,741 --> 00:38:21,580
What did you say?

572
00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:29,700
Bao Zi, more talking and you'll lose.

573
00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:41,120
Bao Zi, use Inject Poison to break the captain's super armor.

574
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:45,600
Tang Rou, limit the captain's range of activities.

575
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:51,280
Sorry, my mistake.

576
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:53,440
It's okay, Yifan.

577
00:39:13,950 --> 00:39:15,980
   

578
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:19,180
   

579
00:39:19,180 --> 00:39:21,660
An Wenyi, cancel the debuff.

580
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:28,660
We're all going to die under your command.

581
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:29,920
What's this nonsense?

582
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:31,640
There's no need to cancel the debuff.

583
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:35,400
Cause he has unilaterally declared that the game is over.

584
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:38,920
You spoke fast, the commands were correct

585
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:42,380
but you are just like reading a textbook. You don't know how to be flexible.

586
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:46,080
You can pass if you're dealing with an ordinary person

587
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:48,940
But he is the author of "Textbook of Glory".

588
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:51,360
That's simply ridiculous.

589
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:55,920
Besides, Captain Ye knows so much about everybody.

590
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:57,880
There's no chance to overturn him.

591
00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:00,120
My teammates are weak today, bad luck for me.

592
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:02,660
I will gamble and say I lose.

593
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:04,980
I have enough self-respect not to ask for a contract.

594
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:06,480
Goodbye.

595
00:40:10,460 --> 00:40:12,740
An Wenyi! Please wait.

596
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:17,400
An Wenyi, wait a minute.

597
00:40:19,860 --> 00:40:23,180
Captain, it was my fault. I wasn't a good commander.

598
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:25,640
Stay.

599
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:33,340
I can grant your extra request.

600
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:36,180
I look forward to a happy cooperation.

601
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:41,550
    

602
00:40:41,550 --> 00:40:43,270
   

603
00:40:43,270 --> 00:40:45,440
   

604
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:47,240
   

605
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:50,620
   

606
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:57,580
For the long-term development of our team,

607
00:40:57,580 --> 00:41:01,000
we need to cultivate new talents for the second echelon.

608
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:04,280
Do you have plans about this future development?

609
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:09,660
It seems a little early to talk about things so distant.

610
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:15,460
Then, let's talk about the present.

611
00:41:15,460 --> 00:41:18,460
Have you decided about An Wenyi's salary?

612
00:41:18,460 --> 00:41:20,840
I have to calculate the cost of each person

613
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:22,940
and sign a contract with him as soon as possible.

614
00:41:22,940 --> 00:41:26,900
I...haven't decided yet.

615
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:30,420
Haven't decided yet?

616
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:37,180
These questions should be decided before the interview.

617
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:43,160
Look at this.

618
00:41:44,513 --> 00:41:47,920
An Wenyi's Exclusive Plan.
