24
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:37,500
How about the guild?

25
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:39,800
Fine.

26
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,700
Pretty busy.

27
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:44,300
Do you have something else to say, vice captain?

28
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:46,700
Or I'd better go now.

29
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:49,400
Are you still interested to join the team one?

30
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:57,520
You know, guild is important for Jia Shi.

31
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:00,300
Without your support,

32
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:04,000
the team will find difficult to gather materials in game instance.

33
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,200
However,

34
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:16,960
if there's someone
who attempts to gain a foothold in our team to make waves,

35
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:21,360
then no matter how difficult we may find, we will kick this guy out.

36
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:27,400
Chen, you're suitable for guild work,

37
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,060
 

38
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:32,360
but these things won't be useful.

39
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:38,160
Just focus on your own business.

40
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:55,000
 
 

41
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,780
- Have you gotten all the skill points? 
 - Yep.

42
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:03,480
Are you ready to celebrate?

43
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:07,900
Mo Fan, All set?

44
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:11,300
Yes, K/D ratio has been over 0.96.

45
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:14,680
Ready to go?

46
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:17,700
Take it easy! No problem.

47
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:19,900
Well, then let's go.

48
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:26,170
Go! Go! Go!

49
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:34,300
 Subtitles and Timing provided to you by💥🍥 TEAM 7️⃣ 🍥💥 @viki.com 

50
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:38,480
The match today is Xing Xin versus Jia Shi
scored by kill count.

51
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:41,240
The map randomly chosen
is the Place of Exile Dungeon.

52
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:44,300
As agreed by both sides, as long as Xing Xin scores a point,

53
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:47,900
it can keep its competition
eligibility for the Challenge.

54
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:50,780
So let's get ready!

55
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,600
What?

56
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:01,500
Sun Xiang is unexpectedly
not in the starting line-up.

57
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,420
Captain, should we alter our tactics?

58
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:05,000
Adopt Plan B

59
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Yi Fan, you'll replace Lao Wei to start the game.

60
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:19,500
We'll aim at Sheng Ling Mie

61
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:23,100
This historic game between Xing Xin and Jia Shi is fueled by a bet,

62
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:26,740
which is the competition eligibility of Xing Xin

63
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:30,940
Even though it's not an official one, the delicate relationship between two teams

64
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:33,720
still makes this game a hot topic.

65
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:38,500
Under the leadership of Ye Qiu, will Xing Xin go forward or stop over there?

66
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,360
It is seen that Jia Shi wins a good beginning.

67
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,260
They have recognized Xing Xin's Cleric.

68
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:45,400
Now Jia Shi targets at Cold Hands.

69
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,900
Sheng Ling Mie keeps blocking him with skills,

70
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:50,780
in order to slow him down or even directly weed him out.

71
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,800
The Cleric from Xing Xin enters the Old Town.

72
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,500
Keep rank. Roll back.

73
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:08,220
Got it. Move.

74
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,841
No! It's a trap!

75
00:05:10,841 --> 00:05:12,080
Xing Xin applied a tactic.

76
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,860
Han Yan Rou and Dragon Breaks
the Ranks give him a direct attack.

77
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:17,421
Sheng Ling Mie edged away from it, but Striker Successive Strike is knocked over.

78
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:27,000
Sheng Ling Mie uses Rock Punch, moving back by recoil.

79
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,300
He misestimates the distance and one of his feet is frozen.

80
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:36,260
It can't be real! How big the array of ice is?

81
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:39,480
Han Yan Rou and Dragon Breaks the Ranks made such an overestimation.

82
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:42,100
It's because of SP. They've strengthened their skill rank.

83
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:44,320
We have no advantage here. Pull out!

84
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:47,040
Sheng Ling Mie breaks out from the siege and adopts a tactical dodging.

85
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:49,960
The rest of Jia Shi also scatter.

86
00:05:52,701 --> 00:05:54,740
They use electronic eye. It means that the tactician

87
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:57,140
will overlook the battlefield in order to design targeted tactics.

88
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:58,590
All the Xing Xin players' dodging

89
00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:01,860
and skills are captured by Xiao Shi Qin.

90
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:10,050
No, there's one person still out of sight.

91
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:31,980
Deception is very agile and elusive. His operation is quite smooth.

92
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:36,080
It is Scrap Picker who is good at seizing the moment.

93
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:39,500
Strangle Knot from Behind.

94
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:40,900
Deception attack Sheng Ling Mie again.

95
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:44,460
The core members have lost half of HP.

96
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,480
And Deception sticks to Sheng Ling Mie

97
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,240
finding a chance for close
quarters and consuming his HP.

98
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:02,260
Brilliant! The strike from Mo Fan greatly wounded Sheng Ling Mie.

99
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:15,440
Very close. Deception keeps dashing,

100
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,640
takes the chance that Sheng Ling Mie turns back on to him. Thruster!

101
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:20,120
Sheng Ling Mie pull himself away from Deception.

102
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:24,000
Besiege them. Mo Fan, come back and support us.

103
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,760
And I will look for a chance.

104
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:28,021
Now Jun Mo Xiao arrives. Dragon Tooth.

105
00:07:28,021 --> 00:07:32,140
Yes, it's shown that Xing Xin is aiming at eliminating Sheng Ling Mie.

106
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:33,740
Bounding mine! Sheng Ling Mie is really swift.

107
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:36,680
Jun Mo Xiao escapes by jumping up, keeps chasing to attack.

108
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:39,700
Energy Connon!

109
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:41,760
Jun Mo Xiao is hit.

110
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:45,020
It's from Dancing Rain. She covers Sheng Ling Mie's withdrawal.

111
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:46,430
Jun Mo Xiao and Dancing
Rain used to be the best partners,

112
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:47,480
but now they fight against each other.

113
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,840
Jun Mo Xiao is blocked.

114
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:51,630
Will he choose to beat off Dancing Rain first?

115
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:57,100
You merely focus on Xiao Shi Qin rather than saying hi to me.

116
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:59,200
He sends you to block me.

117
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:02,200
Good idea.

118
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:19,300
They truly know each other very well.

119
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:23,720
Regardless of being partners or being rivals, they are always well matched.

120
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,680
Stiffness bullet.

121
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:34,940
Both of them are hanging in the air.

122
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:37,060
They used to be true best partners.

123
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:40,060
How tacit they are!

124
00:08:41,201 --> 00:08:43,200
They remain in the air. Dancing Rain attempts to attack.

125
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,640
So does Jun Mo Xiao. At the same time! Again!

126
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:48,440
They fire anti-tank gun simultaneously.

127
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,700
I've blocked Jun Mo Xiao.

128
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:12,300
But suddenly, Sheng Ling Mie stop moving. Is that a device?

129
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:17,780
Ninja Burrowing.

130
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:19,900
I've been waiting for this for a long time.

131
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:24,780
Bounding mine! Absolutely, it's designed by Sheng Ling Mie.

132
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:28,420
Xiao Shi Qin is a tactician indeed.

133
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:31,980
Followed by Aerial bombs. Deception's HP is rapidly declining.

134
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:34,300
Go and keep the pace with Mo Fan.

135
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:43,400
His teammates timely arrive to rescue him from the trap.

136
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,620
- Xiao An, get set at position one. 
 - Roger.

137
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:47,400
Mo Fan, defend.

138
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:50,060
It should be mine.

139
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,860
He abruptly speeds up, hindering his teammate Yi Cun Hui

140
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:57,600
- and Cold Hands to exercise their skills. 
 - Wait, Mo Fan!

141
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,400
What are you doing?

142
00:10:10,981 --> 00:10:14,200
Once the target is hit, the game is over.

143
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:17,840
What? Deception and Han Yan Rou bump into each other.

144
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:20,740
No communication between them? Too reckless!

145
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:24,800
In such a crucial competition, it is undoubtedly a blunder!

146
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:30,510
Satellite Ray. Emergency!

147
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:36,300
Han Yan Rou's HP is emptied. Deception is in danger, too!

148
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:40,300
Double kill! Mastering the art of perfect timing helps him kill two of Xing Xin.

149
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:43,301
- Xiao Shi Qin ensnares them To support Dancing Rain. 
 - How does that happen?

150
00:10:43,301 --> 00:10:46,010
Now Xing Xin is in great danger.

151
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:56,640
Captain, I remain only half a HP.

152
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,040
Mo Fan and I have been weeded out.

153
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:00,300
We lose all the benefits!

154
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:02,700
We have neither enough carry nor time.

155
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:05,460
If nothing changes, we'll lose the game.

156
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:11,260
The game is not over yet. Cheer up.

157
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:13,320
Yi Fan and Xiao An, notice your HP, and see you in District C.

158
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,360
Roger.

159
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:16,340
Lao Wei, go for it.

160
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:18,540
Windward Formation, Xing
Xin's substitute, joins the game.

161
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:21,980
But Jun Mo Xiao is being blocked by three rivals and unable to get out of them.

162
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:25,540
Xing Xin's players should get together right now.

163
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:27,170
Sheng Ling Mie takes the advantage of gunshot,

164
00:11:27,170 --> 00:11:29,560
drains the HP of Yi Cun Hui and Cold Hands.

165
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:31,600
- Jun Mo Xiao escaped! 
- Coordinates?

166
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,470
249 653.

167
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:39,220
It's substitute district. They're going there for Windward Formation.

168
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:41,420
It's my showtime.

169
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:44,390
Jia Shi's Matchstick is
moving to substitute district,

170
00:11:44,390 --> 00:11:45,960
and Leaf of Autumn will replace him.

171
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:48,061
It appears that they'll let Sun Xiang finish the game.

172
00:11:48,061 --> 00:11:50,020
As we can see, Xing Xin are now short of hands.

173
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:51,880
Yi Cun Hui and Cold Hands remain only a little HP,

174
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:54,080
while Jia Shi keep blocking them.

175
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,040
Anti-tank gun!

176
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,760
Retreat.

177
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:10,480
Jun Mo Xiao covers the rest of Xing Xin to retreat

178
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,800
and wait for a chance to recover.

179
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:15,620
Drawing Jia Shi's attention, will offer them a good opportunity to heal.

180
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:27,660
No! Leaf of Autumn arrives ahead of him and blocks them.

181
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:44,200
- Stiffness bullet! 
- Leaf of Autumn is hindered by Jun Mo Xiao.

182
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,440
They finally come face to face with each other.

183
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,320
Jun Mo Xiao controlled by Ye Qiu

184
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:51,460
clashes with Leaf of Autumn
controlled by Sun Xiang.

185
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:57,540
Leaf of Autumn stops blocking and dashes to Jun Mo Xiao.

186
00:12:57,540 --> 00:13:00,720
By switching forms, Jun Mo Xiao strikes back with Gatling Gear,

187
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:04,300
dodges the attack from Leaf of Autumn by sliding.

188
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:06,241
At present, Jun Mo Xiao intends to block Leaf of Autumn,

189
00:13:06,241 --> 00:13:09,100
thus helping his teammates quickly retreat and regenerate HP.

190
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,100
I'll block him.

191
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:13,280
And you move in the direction of 10 o' clock.

192
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:21,660
Dragon Soaring! Leaf of Autumn uses an ultimate skill,

193
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:23,780
which shows that he'd like to
finish the game as fast as possible to chase those without enough HP.

194
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:26,560
Jun Mo Xiao turns his gun into shield. He's gonna directly take it?

195
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:29,700
No. Dragon Soaring was aimed at

196
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:32,540
Leaf of Autumn feinted against Jun Mo Xiao in order to wait for a chance

197
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:34,000
to kill those two of Xing Xin.

198
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,880
Before returning to League, You still have a long way to go.

199
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:40,960
Awesome tactics! Double kill!

200
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:44,420
Xing Xin is on the edge of danger with less than one minute left.

201
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:46,781
Jun Mo Xiao is under siege of five of Jia Shi.

202
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:07,320
He persists in his original goal which is to kill Sheng Ling Mie.

203
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:10,320
Only twenty seconds left.

204
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:17,760
Gate of Death!

205
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,980
At this critical moment, except Sheng Ling Mie,
four of Jia Shi are captured.

206
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:22,540
Windward Formation arrives.

207
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:23,740
Not much time left.

208
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,840
Sheng Ling Mie's HP keeps decreasing.

209
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:35,440
Five seconds left.

210
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:44,140
Three.

211
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:45,520
Two.

212
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:48,170
The last hit. Can he make it?

213
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:53,200
Fire!

214
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:18,840
Time's up.

215
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:21,501
Sheng Ling Mie surprisingly remains 0.1% of HP.

216
00:15:21,501 --> 00:15:22,600
What a pity.

217
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:25,440
Unfortunately, Xing Xin was defeated.

218
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:29,180
Let's go back.

219
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:57,960
Bao Zi sneaked it again?

220
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:00,780
- No, I didn't. 
- Boss, I saw him.

221
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:06,560
Well, let me help you.

222
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:11,600
We'll go for the Challenge!

223
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:19,540
Bao Zi, are these slanted?

224
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:22,180
Bao Zi?

225
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:26,400
Taking part in the Challenge may be impossible for us.

226
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:34,920
We lost the game...

227
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:40,400
We'd better clean up these things, in case they feel upset.

228
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:44,920
Don't do that.

229
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:47,940
Just because they are upset now, we should keep these things intact.

230
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:50,921
We should cheer them up.

231
00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:59,900
Come on, never mind,

232
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:03,840
even though we miss the chance this year, we can seize it next year.

233
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:09,220
Hurry up, let's get these things done!

234
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:15,700
 

235
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:28,840
Captain Ye,

236
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:33,760
Xing Xin finally killed one of Jia Shi.

237
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,960
We didn't fail completely?

238
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,640
There was a mistake in the referee's timer.

239
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:40,820
You successfully killed Xiao
Shi Qin at the last moment.

240
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,300
You made a big mistake.

241
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:01,620
The name of team is wrong.

242
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:03,900
It should be called

243
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,120
Xing Xin.

244
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:10,360
Boss, from now on,

245
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:13,840
Ye Xiu and Jun Mo Xiao will always be with Xing Xin.

246
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,940
Tang Rou, Han Yan Rou will be with Xingxin.

247
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:17,700
Bao Zi, the Invader will always be with Xing Xin.

248
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:20,840
Qiao Yi Fan, Yi Cun Hui will be with Xing Xin.

249
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,810
Thank you so much.

250
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:29,281
I will not fail your expectation.

251
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,160
Dad,

252
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:56,140
something puzzling happens to me today,

253
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:58,200
would you like to hear me?

254
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:01,220
Our team

255
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:04,850
have tackled all kinds of toughness,

256
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:09,620
but still failed to reach the Challenge.

257
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:19,000
We can wait for another year,

258
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,940
but, you know, easier said than actually done.

259
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:25,180
Dad,

260
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:29,140
will this team still exist?

261
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:34,420
Are they really willing to face failure and consequences?

262
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:40,601
Why don't you choose Battlemage as Leaf of Autumn?

263
00:19:40,601 --> 00:19:42,421
Short-sighted.
Battlemage as Leaf of Autumn?

264
00:19:42,421 --> 00:19:44,800
For you, Launcher is enough.

265
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,160
See,

266
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:07,380
 ♫ Your old coat feels like an umbrella ♫ 

267
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:10,520
No matter how far your target is, once you are determined,

268
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:12,740
you just need to focus on it

269
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:15,040
and never give up,

270
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:19,140
then you will finally reach it.

271
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:20,780
Got it?

272
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:22,440
Have a try.

273
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,000
Never say never.

274
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,580
Find out about wrongdoings.

275
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:37,180
Try again.

276
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:42,220
Fire!

277
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:50,720
That's my girl!

278
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:55,200
Dad, I got it.

279
00:20:57,700 --> 00:21:00,980
What I should do is to promise them

280
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:07,580
I'll make all my efforts to
lead them to the destination.

281
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:12,040
As long as we are still be together,

282
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:13,960
we will never lose hope.

283
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:20,920
We should face our failure, find out our problems

284
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:23,640
and tackle them.

285
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:25,820
 ♫ Time sometimes flies so
fast when we are together ♫ 

286
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:30,160
 ♫ Sometimes time becomes so slow ♫ 

287
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:38,060
 ♫ You are my dearest in my heart ♫ 

288
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:42,000
Dad,

289
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:48,360
There's still a long way to go.

290
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:55,100
 ♫ Let us stay together ♫ 

291
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:02,520
A candy for you to make you feel sweet and happier.

292
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:03,840
Or eat a lemon?

293
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:06,980
Its sour can let you forget all the troubles.

294
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:28,380
Congratulations.

295
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:32,040
But you are merely worth one point.

296
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:53,600
Team can't survive without funds,

297
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:56,240
but I'm not good at making money.

298
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:58,580
Boss, that's not a big problem.

299
00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:02,240
Adequate funds will not
automatically bring a team unity.

300
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:07,420
You're right.

301
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,410
Although I am not good at making money,

302
00:23:13,410 --> 00:23:16,560
providing backup services, and administering,

303
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:21,260
I will work harder and never give up!

304
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:30,840
Let's reflect on our performance.

305
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:33,500
Yes, the Challenge is coming soon.

306
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:36,801
We ought to find out our wrongdoings.

307
00:23:36,801 --> 00:23:39,020
We should make more efforts than ever before

308
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:40,920
and adjust our training methods.

309
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:44,360
Take it easy.

310
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:52,620
As for tonight, let's take a break.

311
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:58,620
Have you been eager to get some rest?

312
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:00,340
What about tonight?

313
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:03,480
In normal times you are restrained by team rules.

314
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:07,780
So tonight is the time for you to do something you want

315
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:09,220
but you are not allowed before.

316
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:11,760
Are you frozen? Come back!

317
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,560
- See you! 
- Bye!

318
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:22,000
- Bye-bye! 
- See you then.

319
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,400
-Bye. - Goodbye.

320
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:09,240
Any comment on me today?

321
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,960
Really relentless.

322
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:18,560
But... professional.

323
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:20,000
Of course I am!

324
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,800
Because I have a good trainer.

325
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:31,080
By the way, where are you going?

326
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,780
No idea.

327
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:40,380
♫ ♫

328
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:45,280
 ♫ I'm just as before ♫ 

329
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:47,700
Why not get on the bus? Then get off whenever you want.

330
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:54,080
 ♫ Remain true to original aspiration ♫ 

331

 ♫ I'm just as before ♫ 

334

If you were me, what would you do?

335
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:23,240
You would shoulder the responsibility
and grow stronger, wouldn't you?

336
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:28,090
 ♫ I believe after frustration ♫ 

337
00:26:28,090 --> 00:26:32,300

338
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:34,520

00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:28,960
 ♫ Standing at the peak of the star ♫

 ♫ I once saw the legend ♫ 

352
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:53,060
 ♫ I once saw the legend ♫ 

353
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:02,320
You have something in mind?

354
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:05,920
Why not tell me about it?

355
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:12,280
Telling someone who knows me well
will be useless but trouble her.

356
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:28,980
Young man, what's your troubles?

357
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:33,400
Tell me to please me.

358
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:38,800
I...

359
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,890
just have some mixed feelings.

360
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:45,200
All of you have made progress,

361
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:48,740
especially Sun Xiang who has made a dramatic improvement.

362
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:55,140
Xiao Shi Qin is truly helpful.

363
00:28:55,140 --> 00:29:01,400
He enlightened Sun Xiang to win the game rather than merely defeating you.

364
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:05,540
So, does it make you upset?

365
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:09,180
I remember your brother's words that only facing competitive rivals,

366
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:11,160
will we grow stronger.

367
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:16,700
You also said that You will be back in a year.

368
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:19,160
Now there only half a year left,

369
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:22,200
and you cannot forget your words.

370
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:26,500
I have never forgotten my words.

371
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:47,840
Yesterday I popped over
every place you might go to!

372
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:51,800
I went to Lao Wei's previous studio, then went to Xiao An's campus.

373
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:55,800
In case Yi Fan went back his hometown, I even waited at the train station.

374
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:58,760
But you guys just got high

375
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:01,540
in which were near net bar
within only one kilometer!

376
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:03,460
How much time I wasted!

377
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:06,721
Considering that no one contents with the game yesterday,

378
00:30:06,721 --> 00:30:08,980
we'll hold a secret ballot.

379
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:12,800
Don't pass the buck.

380
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:15,060
If I'm the one who should be blamed the most,

381
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:18,320
then I will do my utmost to improve your living conditions;

382
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:21,020
if that's not me but one of you,

383
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:24,320
this guy will undergo some devils training,

384
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:27,520
and the rest of you will not be punished.

385
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:30,080
Go ahead.

386
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:31,840
What is it all about?

387
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:33,500
Say something, Ye.

388
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:36,080
Do we have to find someone to blame?

389
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:43,520
Luo Ji, count ballots later.

390
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:45,480
Okay.

391
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:50,720
Now they are all sitting here,

392
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:53,320
but still have some unsettled problems.

393
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:56,340
They actually got the hump

394
00:30:56,340 --> 00:30:58,600
but felt embarrassed to speak out.
 

395
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:00,680
Not far off.

396
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:02,680
Indeed, they need a chance to speak out.

397
00:31:04,401 --> 00:31:06,980
 
Mo Fan's under considerable stress.

398
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:11,180
Unless he releases it, he will never dare to face it.

399
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:15,560
For the rest of them, it is a good chance to be open and honest.
 

400
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:23,220
Boss, now you are clever the same as me.

401
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:25,900
Same?

402
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:28,760
No, we are different.

403
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:30,410
I am

404
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:34,120
totally sincere.

405
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:36,680
Really?

406
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:37,960
Yes, I not only urge them to do that, but urge myself

407
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:40,880
but urge myself to complete my schedule as early as possible.

408
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:44,160
It's fair to us all, so I'm sincere.

409
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:04,750
One vote goes to Tang Rou.

410
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:07,080
One vote goes to the boss.

411
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:11,040
One vote goes to Qiao Yi Fan.

412
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:12,520
One vote goes to An Wen Yi.

413
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:14,160
One vote goes to Wei Chen.

414
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:15,960
One vote goes to the captain.

415
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:20,620
As for the last one...

416
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:23,361
The last one will either make everyone get one vote,

417
00:32:23,361 --> 00:32:26,200
or determine who will be punished.

418
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,640
Captain Ye,

419
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:30,080
What do you think?

420
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:32,960
Unfold it.

421
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,620
This is an abstention.

422
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:47,080
So the one who won't be punished is Mo Fan.

423
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:49,840
Any other ideas?

424
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:52,260
It shouldn't be like this.

425
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:54,860
I deserve the punishment and blame because of what i did.

426
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:57,181
Nope, it's my fault.

427
00:32:57,181 --> 00:32:58,960
I could have kill Lao Xiao in
the second half of the game.

428
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:01,600
My fault. I didn't protect Xiao An well.

429
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:04,220
It's not your problem but mine.

430
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:06,500
I failed to heal you, either.

431
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:08,220
I'll take responsibility for our failure.

432
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:09,900
No, I should be blamed.

433
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:12,080
If I can attack rivals in a more effective manner,

434
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:14,261
we couldn't have suffered such an awkward situation.

435
00:33:14,261 --> 00:33:17,180
Nay! It's all my fault.

436
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:19,380
If I have joined you, they wouldn't have won.

437
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:21,300
Are you kidding? It's none of your business.

438
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:23,160
You were not there yesterday, and you know nothing.

439
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:25,860
It's not a proper way to ask for more training.

440
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:33,040
In Xing Xin team, we stick to the facts.

441
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:35,100
You needn't apologize for it so eagerly.

442
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:36,020
Have a seat.

443
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:39,460
Well, except Mo Fan,

444
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:41,000
as we promised just now,

445
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,480
because each of us gets one vote,

446
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:45,200
each of us should face punishment.

447
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:47,180
We have no problem with that,

448
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:50,780
but you may face a big problem.

449
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:53,900
Boss, to be honest, we are
satisfied with current situation.

450
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:55,480
I haven't done nearly enough.

451
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:58,720
You all try your best, I ought to do my utmost, too.

452
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:00,360
In another word, as your boss,

453
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:03,980
of course I should be a good role model.

454
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:06,420
What has been said cannot be unsaid.

455
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:09,040
Even if it is a burden, it's my pleasure to shoulder it.

456
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:12,680
Captain Ye, you used a wrong word.

457
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:16,220
There's no burden for me but pleasure.

458
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,500
Hello?

459
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:23,620
You want to buy skill books?

460
00:34:23,620 --> 00:34:25,340
Well, you need to queue up,

461
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:28,300
because there are considerable
teams waiting to buy.

462
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:30,240
Look, first come, first serve.

463
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:34,160
Thanks for your support.

464
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:36,780
Boss, what are you selling?

465
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:38,580
You know, the skill is our competitiveness.

466
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:42,980
So I am trying to transform our skill into products.

467
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:46,740
That's why our skill books are the best choice.

468
00:34:46,740 --> 00:34:47,640
That's true！

469
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:49,400
Improving SP with skill books,

470
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:52,040
for other teams, is really attractive.

471
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:53,300
Why couldn't I think of that?

472
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:54,401
Of course you couldn't.

473
00:34:54,401 --> 00:34:57,220
I was inspired by our captain.

474
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:00,440
Although it's unsure whether there's any buyer,

475
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:03,080
at least I could give a try.

476
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:05,620
Hello?

477
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:10,020
Yes?

478
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:15,160
Make a deal!

479
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:38,720
We huddle together in the hurly-burly,

480
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:41,140
but still find joy.

481
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:46,160
However, we can't be stuck in a rut.

482
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:52,880
Since we sold skill books, Our new life begins.

483
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:54,900
Well,

484
00:35:54,900 --> 00:36:00,580
Being woke up by noisy radio is not what we look forward to.

485
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:11,820
 ♫ The Third Set of Radio Calisthenics ♫ 

486
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:13,240
Who's doing that?  ♫ for China's Middle
School Students: Dancing Steps of Youth ♫ 

487
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:15,520
I hate it!

488
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:22,680
Bao Zi,

489
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:25,180
Bao Zi, wake up!

490
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:29,940
Get out of bed, or we'll be late for training.

491
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:31,480
Wake up!

492
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:40,860
Captain and buddies, it's time to get up!

493
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:50,680
Here you are. I've made breakfast, in case you'll be late.

494
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:52,060
We can't be late at all!

495
00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:54,201
It's only eight now,

496
00:36:54,201 --> 00:36:56,160
unless you live in GMT+9 timezone.

497
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:58,500
You wake us up an hour early.

498
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:00,240
- No, captain, - I don't wanna eat it.

499
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:01,720
It's specially prepared for you.

500
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:03,780
You have to eat up your food.

501
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:06,560
I slept so well here.

502
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:07,420
Look at this room.

503
00:37:07,420 --> 00:37:10,660
Look at this TV, furniture and decoration.

504
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:13,740
It seems designed for me.

505
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:18,460
Without my enormous contribution,

506
00:37:18,460 --> 00:37:20,460
we couldn't have had any skill book;

507
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:21,900
Without skill books,

508
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:24,520
we couldn't have had such a big house.

509
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:26,600
Without this big house,

510
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:29,900
you couldn't have had such a high living standard.

511
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:33,740
Hey, hey!

512
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:35,740
You boys doe!

513
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:39,380
Well, I know you're thankful for these.

514
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:43,960
What's the matter with him?

515
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:46,720
Last week's training data has been generated.

516
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:48,680
Come here and have a look.

517
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:58,120
Tang Rou's DPS is truly high.

518
00:37:58,120 --> 00:37:59,920
So she certainly has no need to check her data.

519
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:03,540
All of us have made a steady progress.

520
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:05,520
However...

521
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:08,880
To my surprise, bro, you are not the last one but rise from the bottom!

522
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:10,980
Data tells the truth.

523
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:12,900
It's just part of the truth.

524
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:13,820
What does that mean?

525
00:38:13,820 --> 00:38:15,740
It means that you are fortunate this time,

526
00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:19,020
and next time Mo Fan will definitely exceed you, will you, Mo Fan?

527
00:38:49,340 --> 00:38:52,220
Why am I always be the last one?

528
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:59,240
I can't be a burden of Xing Xin.

529
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:02,480
I'll get back to Glory and practice hard.

530
00:39:08,860 --> 00:39:10,560
Although he's at the bottom of this list,

531
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:14,040
But he's at the top of another list.

532
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:20,240
Scrap Picker reward list.

533
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:23,340
No more than three words a week,

534
00:39:23,340 --> 00:39:26,940
I can't see through what's going on in his mind.

535
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:28,940
Let's see him in the game.

536
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:40,900
I am the top Scrap Picker of Glory.

537
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:47,600
This kid's lucky.

538
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:49,020
Got an orange suit at the beginning.

539
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:50,141
So lucky.

540
00:39:50,141 --> 00:39:52,700
 

541
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:55,120
I can't be the last one.

542
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:56,940
What?

543
00:39:56,940 --> 00:39:58,620
He doesn't pick the equipment
after killing someone?

544
00:39:58,620 --> 00:40:00,540
Isn't he here to scrap-pick?

545
00:40:00,540 --> 00:40:03,441
He'll lose badly sooner or later if he still plays like that.

546
00:40:03,441 --> 00:40:06,860
He might be training in this way.

547
00:40:07,580 --> 00:40:10,660
But unfortunately, it's a wrong way.

548
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:32,080
Kill people steadily and severely.

549
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:35,460
My DPS can't be the last.

550
00:40:36,980 --> 00:40:44,010
