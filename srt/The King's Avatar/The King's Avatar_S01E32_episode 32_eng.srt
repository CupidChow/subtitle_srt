 Subtitles and Timing provided to you by💥🍥 TEAM 7️⃣ 🍥💥 @viki.com 

26
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,260
Sorry.

27
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,800
I cheated.

28
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:49,900
Pulling out the cable,
and having phone calls with someone else.

29
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:51,920
These were all my fault.

30
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,840
You don't need to apologize to me.

31
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:56,300
We'd better have a talk rather than

32
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:58,600
waste time on apologizing and forgiving.

33
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:07,300
This cloth armor of Warlock
can quicken movement speed.

34
00:02:07,303 --> 00:02:09,851
It's suitable for the containment of your team.

35
00:02:09,851 --> 00:02:13,340
As for this cross of Cleric,
it can buff health point.

36
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:17,360
And this shinobigatana,
it has no special attribute,

37
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,740
but it was self-made by our team.

38
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:25,600
If it's possible,

39
00:02:26,251 --> 00:02:28,460
I hope it can be free from dismantling.

40
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,400
Now our silver equipment belongs to you.

41
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,400
Using Everlasting's equipment
to promote Team Xing Xin's strength

42
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,380
makes me happy indeed.

43
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,380
But what about you?

44
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:53,000
The day before yesterday,
I sold the furniture of our team,

45
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,440
tabels and chairs were inclusive.

46
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:57,700
Yesterday I liquidated all the money
in our bank accounts.

47
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:58,800
And today, I'm here.

48
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:03,420
Selling all the weapons that had been fighting with us all the time to you.

49
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:05,120
And then?

50
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,051
I'll try to find ways
to continue to stay in Glory.

51
00:03:07,051 --> 00:03:08,800
How?

52
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:11,100
Given your current condition,

53
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:14,320
I can't say it'll be hopeful for
you to get into another team.

54
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:18,400
You're right.

55
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,760
When it comes to physical strength,

56
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,940
I have no chance to win
compared with younger players.

57
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:27,020
Also, my skills don't allow me to
defeat the experienced players.

58
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:29,200
I know it's impossible for me to promote,

59
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,200
but I would never give up.

60
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:35,200
It seems you determine to stick it out in Glory.

61
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,500
Yeah.

62
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:38,200
This is the only thing I can do.

63
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:41,400
Whether I can do it well or not, I'll do it.

64
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:52,740
Hi. Please give me another glass of water.

65
00:03:56,914 --> 00:03:58,700
I've thought about it.

66
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:00,300
It's difficult
for senior players like you to adapt,

67
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:04,040
after joining a new team and using new weapons.

68
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,980
You'll lose more badly.

69
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:11,500
Join Team Xing Xin.

70
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,400
You don't need a loser,

71
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:27,300
and a ratfink who played dirty tricks.

72
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:29,400
That's right.

73
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:32,400
I need you to be a negative example in our team.

74
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,700
There're a lot of kids in our team.

75
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:36,540
When they're lazy, I can tell them,

76
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:40,540
a young idler, an old beggar like Wu Chen.

77
00:04:45,782 --> 00:04:47,677
Don't you reconsider it?

78
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,100
Why would you do that?

79
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,400
Because we're the same kind of people.

80
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,631
Even though we're the only one left,

81
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,620
we'll never get away from Glory.

82
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:23,120
 

83
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:30,240

 ♫ You are as always ♫ 

85
00:06:01,568 --> 00:06:02,842
Hey, bro.

86
00:06:02,842 --> 00:06:04,620
Come here to take a picture. Let's record this moment.

87
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:05,980
That's good! Let's get it!

88
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:07,880
- Come here! 
 - Are you ready?

89
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:11,220
- Yes! 
 - One, two, three.

90
00:06:14,654 --> 00:06:16,740
Silver equipment!

91
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:18,700
- It's silver equipment! 
 - It's real!

92
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:19,911
Everyone has a silver equipment.

93
00:06:19,911 --> 00:06:21,540
I have a silver equipment, too!

94
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:24,114
- That's awesome! Captain! 
 - Thank you, Captain!

95
00:06:24,114 --> 00:06:27,428
- Captain, you're so kind! 
 - You're so awesome, Captain!

96
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:36,620
 ♫ I am as always, ♫ 

97
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:43,880
 ♫ writing an ending for the story ♫ 

98
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:49,520
Every stuff here is made by you.

99
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:53,800
Without you, there is no Everlasting.

100
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:56,623
I remember at the beginning of Everlasting's establishment, we didn't get enough money.

101
00:06:56,623 --> 00:06:58,600
So you were the Captain at the daytime,

102
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:01,500
and a worker here at night.

103
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,437
At some point, I was thinking,

104
00:07:03,437 --> 00:07:06,180
like piecing up a computer
with various components,

105
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:09,700
you made this team an integral whole.

106
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:12,000
 
You even sold your silver equipment.

107
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,600
In order to intensify teammates' equipment.

108
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:18,300
You said you don't care
orange equipment is good or not.

109
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:21,400
The only thing you care
is the future of Everlasting.

110
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:24,000
You must be tired.

111
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,240
Have you ever regretted of joining Everlasting?

112
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,900
It should be the other way around.

113
00:07:30,465 --> 00:07:34,605
Without Everlasting, I'm nothing.

114
00:07:34,605 --> 00:07:37,000
Although life here was short,

115
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,400
it's the most precious memory of me.

116
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:41,400
I don't regret.

117
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:48,120
Because everything I did for
Evelasting makes me feel happy.

118
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:50,200
Right.

119
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:52,200
What's your future plan?

120
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:59,700
If it's possible, I want to form another team.

121
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:03,800
It's name would still be Everlasting.
 

122
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,840
Great.
 

123
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,300
Be sure to save a seat for me at that time.
 

124
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:09,900
By the way,

125
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Here are your and the guild's accounts.

126
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,220
From now on, Everlasting belongs to you.

127
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:29,420
You can deal with it at your disposal.

128
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:31,028

Thank you for never giving up Everlasting.

133
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:50,400
But this is the end between you and this team.

134
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,600
Even though Everlasting has been dismissed,

135
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,720
I'm still here.

136
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:04,380
With these accounts,
I'll keep staying in the Glory.

137
00:09:07,165 --> 00:09:09,202
For all of you.

138
00:09:14,525 --> 00:09:16,182
Till the end,

139
00:09:16,182 --> 00:09:19,740

has defeated professional teams repeatedly.

00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:58,354
What's their secret of success?

152
00:09:58,354 --> 00:09:59,480
Come here!

153
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:01,901
- Bao Zi. 
 - Come here!

154
00:10:01,901 --> 00:10:03,540
Here comes the highlight.

155
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:05,740
My elegant mien.

156
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:06,970
Hello.

157
00:10:06,970 --> 00:10:09,010
Could you talk about your secret of leadership

158
00:10:09,010 --> 00:10:11,220
which helped Team Xing Xin perform so well?

159
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:12,241
Hi, guys.

160
00:10:12,241 --> 00:10:14,940
I'm from Xing Xin Net Café. My name is Chen...

161
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:18,480
A network outage?

162
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,460
 

163
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:22,860
- Are you kidding us?
- Boss.

164
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:25,508
Got off on the wrong foot.

165
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:30,780
Drop the ball at the critical moment.

166
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:32,680
You look beautiful.

167
00:10:34,514 --> 00:10:37,020
Guo Guo. Though we haven't heard what you said,

168
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:38,600
when you appeared on the scene,

169
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,900
you were a boss of a top team!

170
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:40,781
- What do you think?

171
00:10:40,781 --> 00:10:42,680
Tha's right.

172
00:10:44,674 --> 00:10:46,468
You're awesome, Tang.

173
00:10:46,468 --> 00:10:49,717
Without you, we can't win
the seventh consecutive victory.

174
00:10:49,717 --> 00:10:50,674
Right?

175
00:10:50,674 --> 00:10:52,420
- Yes.
- That owes to all of us.

176
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:54,802
If Xiao An didn't protect me in the rear,

177
00:10:54,802 --> 00:10:57,420
how could I fight in the front?

178
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:59,560
Without Yi Fan's protection, I can't survive to the end.

179
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:01,317
Am I right, Yi Fan?

180
00:11:01,317 --> 00:11:05,880
I can't fight smoothly
if Senior Wei didn't blaze a trail for me.

181
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:07,280
That's right!

182
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:09,860
That we've got such a good performance today

183
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:12,640
owes to the joint efforts made by all of us.

184
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,345
Come on. Let me take the lead.

185
00:11:14,345 --> 00:11:15,888
You guys follow up.

186
00:11:15,888 --> 00:11:17,220
- Here.
- Here.

187
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:18,800
- Here. 
 - Cheers!

188
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,160
Excuse me.

189
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:23,520
Drinking is prohibited during competition.

190
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:25,441
- Right. 
 - That's right.

191
00:11:25,441 --> 00:11:28,581
- Then we'd better stop here. 
 - Beer is not liquor.

192
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:32,160
Cocktail is not liquor.

193
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:35,620
Sparkling wine is not liquor.

194
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:37,160
Red wine is not liquor too!

195
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:39,940
Cheers!

196
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:48,400
 

197
00:11:52,242 --> 00:11:53,940
Come on!

198
00:11:56,182 --> 00:11:57,488
Come on! We're late.

199
00:11:57,488 --> 00:11:58,834
Quick, quick!

200
00:11:58,834 --> 00:12:00,600
Be quickly!

201
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:03,260
Come on! Can you two be quickly?

202
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:05,320
Here we are.

203
00:12:15,951 --> 00:12:16,982
Are you tired?

204
00:12:16,982 --> 00:12:18,660
Yes.

205
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:22,460
If so, forty more push-ups, and three groups of sit-ups.

206
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:25,097
Are you serious? Captain. I can't do it.

207
00:12:25,097 --> 00:12:26,740
Go.

208
00:12:33,794 --> 00:12:36,300
Don't watch me like that.

209
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:37,382
What did you do last night?

210
00:12:37,382 --> 00:12:39,085
All of you were late this morning.

211
00:12:39,085 --> 00:12:40,600
Being late should be punished.

212
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,200
That's the rule.

213
00:12:52,674 --> 00:12:55,820
Lao Ye, it's not like the time when we were young.

214
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:59,340
They are all as thin as a shadow.

215
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:01,980
Even I can't bear to punish them.

216
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:04,420
Being late and plead for them.

217
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:06,320
Twenty more push-ups.

218
00:13:07,088 --> 00:13:09,720
Captain.

219
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,420
That's too many.

220
00:13:23,268 --> 00:13:25,110
Welcome to Team Xing Xin.

221
00:13:28,651 --> 00:13:30,174
What is he doing here?

222
00:13:30,174 --> 00:13:34,094
To install monitors, monitor units, and signal jammers.

223
00:13:34,674 --> 00:13:37,557
Do you know why Captain would recruit him into our team?

224
00:13:37,557 --> 00:13:39,420
I just searched.

225
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:42,720
The win rate of Everlasting under
the leadership of Wu Chen is 100%.

226
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,780
Teams like Zhu Xian in the middle of Challenge

227
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:46,420
don't fear outflanking tactics,
but suppressing tactics.

228
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:50,880
Wu Chen's profession can
help us intensify our ranged DPS,

229
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,700
which can repress Team Zhu Xian.

230
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:55,668
So that is what it is.

231
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:57,900
Captain is forethoughtful.

232
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:59,540
Then we'll tolerate him now.

233
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:01,460
If he dares to hatch any sinister plot,

234
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:03,060
Mo Fan.

235
00:14:11,828 --> 00:14:14,820
You mean you won't take part in any competition.

236
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:17,400
You want to manage Xing Xin guild.

237
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:19,140
Yes.

238
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:22,661
Here are ten guild cards
of the common area in Glory,

239
00:14:22,661 --> 00:14:24,402
and two of the Field of God.

240
00:14:24,402 --> 00:14:26,760
That's twelve in total.

241
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:30,260
Here are all the accumulations
on guilds of Everlasting these years.

242
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,820
They can be used for the good of Team Xing Xin.

243
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:36,080
From now on Team Xing Xin's
supply of materials can count on me.

244
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:40,920
All I want is to keep staying
in Glory with these accounts.

245
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,740
But I want you to be a member of Team Xing Xin,

246
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:49,985
to stand on the competition terrain with us.

247
00:14:52,605 --> 00:14:54,580
Think about it.

248
00:14:59,691 --> 00:15:01,460
Wait a sec.

249
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:03,460
Listen to me.

250
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:06,581
I've had a lot of dreams like returning to competition.

251
00:15:06,581 --> 00:15:10,534
But at this age, I know myself well enough.

252
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:13,440
Speaking of age,

253
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:17,985
Lao Wei has been playing well even now.

254
00:15:18,582 --> 00:15:19,500
What?

255
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:20,501
It's your business.

256
00:15:20,501 --> 00:15:22,600
Don't drag me in.

257
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,940
I know my limitations.

258
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:28,960
For me, the ceiling of
professional E-sports is low itself.

259
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:30,560
It's not necessarily so.

260
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:33,040
Lao Wei has hit the ceiling years ago.

261
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,320
Although he has become a
person with bad character,

262
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:37,497
he's also shameless, and dark-minded.

263
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,554
This is growth.

264
00:15:39,554 --> 00:15:41,800
Damn that growth.

265
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,474
I don't have the energy to diss you.

266
00:15:43,474 --> 00:15:45,702
Lao Wei. Keep growing.

267
00:15:45,702 --> 00:15:47,620
Go on.

268
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:06,642
You told me before that it's
impossible for you to promote,

269
00:16:06,642 --> 00:16:08,960
but you would never give up,

270
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:11,371
and you'll stick it out in Glory.

271
00:16:11,371 --> 00:16:15,240
So, these excuses of refusing
to come back to competitions

272
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,940
are what you really want to say?

273
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:27,120
 

274
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,708
 

275
00:16:29,708 --> 00:16:32,180
 

276
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:36,340
He's so heartless in the competition,

277
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:38,780
let alone in the daily life.

278
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:41,840
Playing hard is what he does best.

279
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:44,580
The key is he know how to stir up our emotions.

280
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:45,980
He'll lose no chance.

281
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:49,505
We can't even dodge.

282
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:54,820
It's time to readjust the industrial mode.

283
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:56,960
We must stick to resist.

284
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:58,580
Resist!

285
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:01,661
What are you two doing? Aren't we a team?

286
00:17:01,661 --> 00:17:03,680
Hey, bro! Resist!

287
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,220
That's bullshit.

288
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:06,460
- Yi Fan.
- Shit.

289
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:07,877
I have no idea.

290
00:17:07,877 --> 00:17:08,780
Stop!

291
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:10,357
What did you say? Say it again!

292
00:17:10,357 --> 00:17:11,991
Don't you hit Yi Fan.

293
00:17:11,991 --> 00:17:13,660
Get up.

294
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:15,260
Senior.

295
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:16,251
Help me!

296
00:17:16,251 --> 00:17:17,868
Stop!

297
00:17:19,902 --> 00:17:21,645
What are you doing?

298
00:17:21,645 --> 00:17:23,285
All right!

299
00:17:25,005 --> 00:17:26,300
Captain.

300
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:29,402
Just now, who spoke ill of me?

301
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:36,097
Do you think when I was in the room,

302
00:17:36,097 --> 00:17:38,468
I can't hear what you said?

303
00:17:38,468 --> 00:17:40,474
What the ears he has!

304
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:44,800
Playing hard is what I do best?

305
00:17:48,057 --> 00:17:49,360
We were late.

306
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,040
The push-up was punishment we deserved.

307
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:52,200
It's not playing hard.

308
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,780
It's... It's because we didn't
live up to your expectations.

309
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:56,360
Right. It's an encouragement!

310
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,680
What I did is bad for the industrial mode?

311
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:05,760
No, no, no.

312
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,360
You asked us to have two more hours training.

313
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:08,680
It's not bad for the industrial mode.

314
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:12,601
It's the way you care us! You care us a lot!

315
00:18:12,601 --> 00:18:13,840
And you want to resist?

316
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:16,240
- Uphold!
- Uphold!

317
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,711
Uphold!

318
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,108
What do you uphold?

319
00:18:19,108 --> 00:18:20,137
- We uphold...
- Captain.

320
00:18:20,137 --> 00:18:21,880
Every decision made by Captain.

321
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,220
Yes.

322
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,180
Very well.

323
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:29,600
Then you three, thirty pull-ups.

324
00:18:31,005 --> 00:18:34,261
Luo Ji and Yi Fan should be punished too for the failure to report the facts.

325
00:18:34,261 --> 00:18:36,380
Ten pull-ups.

326
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:40,040
You can't be free from this.

327
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:43,000
But considering you're the victim,

328
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:49,040
I want you to supervise them
until they finish their tasks.

329
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:55,700
Thirty pull-ups.

330
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:57,540
We'll be dead tired.

331
00:18:57,540 --> 00:18:59,380
Yeah.

332
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:03,120
Why is the Captain not here?

333
00:19:06,651 --> 00:19:08,385
That's right.

334
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:24,040
Chen.

335
00:19:24,834 --> 00:19:26,660
What are you doing?

336
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:30,320
Chen. It's too difficult for us to do thirty pull-ups.

337
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,640
Could you let it go this time?

338
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,960
But we must complete what Captain required.

339
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:37,340
Chen, Captain's not here now.

340
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:38,560
What about...

341
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:41,140
Can you let us off?

342
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:43,340
You're putting me in an awkward situation.

343
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:50,780
You see, we're a team now.

344
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:52,860
You're a part of us now after all.

345
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:55,760
From now on, we'll have a lot of
chances to be punished together.

346
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:58,780
Why don't you make it a gift for
our first collective punishment?

347
00:19:59,745 --> 00:20:01,268
What does that mean?

348
00:20:01,268 --> 00:20:02,737
Eighty-four.

349
00:20:02,737 --> 00:20:04,294
Eighty-five.

350
00:20:04,294 --> 00:20:05,960
Eighty-six. Eighty-seven.

351
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:09,460
Actually, Senior Wu Chen is a good person.

352
00:20:10,122 --> 00:20:11,440
I think so.

353
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:14,180
Ninety-one. Come on! Ninety-two.

354
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:17,200
How about our ten pull-ups?

355
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,680
Ninety-three.

356
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:20,900
How many did we do?

357
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:22,880
Cut the crap!

358
00:20:37,691 --> 00:20:40,040
How do you feel doing mischief with them?

359
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:42,000
Clear division of work.

360
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,720
Good teamwork.

361
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:48,945
You look quite happy.

362
00:20:49,611 --> 00:20:50,937
I am.

363
00:20:50,937 --> 00:20:53,280
Exercise can produce dopamine,

364
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,622
which makes people feel happy.

365
00:20:55,622 --> 00:20:58,800
What is your dopamine?

366
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,700
Glory for sure.

367
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:05,240
Except Glory?

368
00:21:06,674 --> 00:21:09,080
Friends who play Glory with me.

369
00:21:09,771 --> 00:21:13,625
I thought after the competition with Everlasting, you'll never admit me.

370
00:21:13,625 --> 00:21:15,560
Pass it to me.

371
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:17,340
Rather than failing to integrate in the team,

372
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:19,620
why not to manage the guild?

373
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:21,794
As a continuation of my life in Glory.

374
00:21:21,794 --> 00:21:23,980
A way to continue my Glory dream.

375
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:28,660
So what do you think now?

376
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:31,462
Now?

377
00:21:31,462 --> 00:21:36,320
I feel like returning to my youth in Everlasting.

378
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:55,805
 

379
00:21:55,805 --> 00:21:56,720
Captain.

380
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:00,620
The first player in Individual
Event hasn't been arranged yet.

381
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:02,480
I already made my decision.

382
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,560
Sorry. I'm late.

383
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:11,140
Make Team Xing Xin stronger.

384
00:22:14,885 --> 00:22:18,560
You should say "Let's make
Team Xing Xin stronger."

385
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:19,820
- Welcome join us, Senior Wu Chen.
- Welcome.

386
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:21,780
Let's do it together!

387
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:27,840
 

388
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,660
 

389
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:31,620
Ye Xiu?

390
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:33,660
Shouldn't it be Ye Qiu?

391
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:35,880
Both of them mean our Captain.

392
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:37,417
Okay. Let's go.

393
00:22:37,417 --> 00:22:39,488
- Let's go. 
 - Something happened!

394
00:22:39,488 --> 00:22:41,465
Something serious!

395
00:22:41,465 --> 00:22:43,700
We've been taken pictures. 
  

396
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:45,109
And it has been put on the cover! 
  

397
00:22:45,109 --> 00:22:47,980
Beautiful female player fixes
the Best Newcomer in advance.

398
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:49,771
Isn't that you, Tang Rou?

399
00:22:49,771 --> 00:22:51,291
There're more in the magazine.

400
00:22:51,291 --> 00:22:52,297
- A lot of pictures.
- Is there more?

401
00:22:52,297 --> 00:22:55,100
Awesome. We've been on the magazine.

402
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,440
Not a big deal.

403
00:22:58,440 --> 00:22:59,920
Just took a horn.

404
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:02,882
Being on the magazine means we're popular now.

405
00:23:02,882 --> 00:23:04,680
That's a good thing.

406
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:07,540
So, you didn't drill the
new tactic at all that night?

407
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:10,400
Without your instruction,
there's no help to drill.

408
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:13,005
Team Xing Xin can thrive without anyone but you.

409
00:23:13,005 --> 00:23:15,960
No tactic is unnecessary.

410
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:19,960
In competition,

411
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:21,740
one more tactic,

412
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:25,280
is one more possibility of organization.

413
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:33,240
At that night, we just want to relax.

414
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:35,740
To adjust our states.

415
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:38,760
Professional players are banned to drink alcohol.

416
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:40,968
This is our consensus.

417
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,780
Delay training for the sake of relaxation.

418
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:46,680
This is slack not relaxation.

419
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:49,960
Respect your competition and your rivals.

420
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:53,720
Don't really regard yourself as a
black horse or the Best Newcomer.

421
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:55,120
Without a good performance,

422
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,760
without excellent strength,

423
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:58,840
we're nothing at all.

424
00:24:06,774 --> 00:24:08,728
This is not Tang's fault.

425
00:24:08,728 --> 00:24:11,265
We went there together.

426
00:24:11,265 --> 00:24:14,857
As for the Best Newcomer,
this is not a title gave by herself.

427
00:24:14,857 --> 00:24:18,280
Can you ensure she wasn't
complacent after seeing this report?

428
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:20,900
- Of course not.
- No, she wasn't. For sure.

429
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:22,620
Yes, I was.

430
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:25,020
I don't see there's anything wrong.

431
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,800
We got the strength,

432
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,280
and a good grade,

433
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:32,680
why shouldn't we be this black horse?

434
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,480
So you're satisfied

435
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,580
only after eight consecutive victories?

436
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:42,671
We can get it even though
it's ten consecutive victories.

437
00:24:42,671 --> 00:24:45,220
And the Best Newcomer, I'll get it.

438
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:50,057
You are confident.

439
00:24:50,057 --> 00:24:51,600
Tang...

440
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,640
With our current strength,

441
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:55,840
I have good reason to be confident.

442
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:00,020
So what kind of strength do you think you have?

443
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:01,720
Tang...

444
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:06,400
I'll show it to you.

445
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:10,880
Tang!

446
00:25:13,051 --> 00:25:16,020
Today's competition is the
last round of the Challenge.

447
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:19,800
Being a new team,
Team Xing Xin is a real black horse.

448
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:22,720
It ranks first on the league table of group B now.

449
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:26,813
But the gap between them and the second place Team Ta Yun is not huge.

450
00:25:26,813 --> 00:25:28,408
Team Xing Xin will go first this round.

451
00:25:28,408 --> 00:25:30,500
If they successfully got seven points,

452
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:33,045
then no matter what grade Team Ta Yun got,

453
00:25:33,045 --> 00:25:35,325
Team Xing Xin will get in the Final.

454
00:25:35,325 --> 00:25:36,640
So this round is very important.

455
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:37,382
Tang Rou,

456
00:25:37,382 --> 00:25:39,660
someone took pictures of you drinking in the bar
after eight consecutive victories.

457
00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:42,460
Do you think your teammates' mentalities
have changed after winning consecutive victories?

458
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:44,197
Tang Rou, what do you think
of Team Xing Xin's overall strength level?

459
00:25:44,197 --> 00:25:45,045
Victory has proven everything.

460
00:25:45,045 --> 00:25:47,800
So do you think what's your strength level?

461
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:51,020
I will prove my strength
and value in the competition.

462
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:54,420
How to prove? One-against-three is a masterpiece of Captain Ye.

463
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:57,920
Have you ever thought of
reproducing it to prove your strength?

464
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:58,980
Sure.

465
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:01,480
I will complete it in the competition.

466
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:03,880
What if you failed? Tang Rou?

467
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:07,260
If I failed, I'll retire from the professional circle.

468
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:08,860
Are you serious?

469
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:10,240
That's a long shot!

470
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:12,800
Isn't this bet too heavy?

471
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:16,060
Come on!

472
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:16,780
Captain Ye.

473
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:19,566
What do you think of Tang Rou's promise of achieving one-against three?

474
00:26:19,566 --> 00:26:21,960
She's bold and resolute.

475
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:24,840
Tang Rou, I heard you promised to
complete one-against-three.

476
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:26,765
I admire your courage. Come on!

477
00:26:26,765 --> 00:26:28,480
I believe in your strength.

478
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:31,060
It's better to keep yourself in low key.

479
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:38,700
Sorry.

480
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:40,500
It's caused by my neglect of duty.

481
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:41,800
After this competition,

482
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:44,160
I'll make a self-criticism.

483
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:48,540
It must be profound and touching.

484
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:51,980
At least 3,000 words, and there's
no cap on the number of words.

485
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:57,520
I think eight words would be enough.

486
00:27:00,685 --> 00:27:04,660
I'll take the lead, and just this once.

487
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:12,200
By the way,

488
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:14,240
what about changing Tang's order in Arena Contest?

489
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:16,980
Don't let her play the first.

490
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:20,024
Don't you want to give her a chance to accomplish one-against-three?

491
00:27:20,024 --> 00:27:22,577
It's obvious that she was getting in a rage. Don't you know it?

492
00:27:22,577 --> 00:27:26,160
I just said, that she is resolute and bold.

493
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:29,140
But if Tang couldn't...

494
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:31,500
It's not that serious.

495
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:36,800
Sometimes, we need to return the
competition to players themselves.

496
00:27:40,565 --> 00:27:43,165
Isn't that Lin Yi, the Captain of Zhu Xian?

497
00:27:43,165 --> 00:27:44,820
Hey...

498
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:47,060
The price we set last time...

499
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:48,440
No problem.

500
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:51,930
If you did it well, we can sign a contract as
soon as the competition's over.

501
00:27:51,930 --> 00:27:53,140
It's a deal.

502
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:54,760
Deal.

503
00:28:04,022 --> 00:28:06,965
Lao Ye. Come here. I got something to tell you.

504
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:14,160
 
I'm a staff of Glory League.

505
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:16,001
Your competition ID is suspected
to be counterfeit.

506
00:28:16,001 --> 00:28:18,000
Please follow us to the headquarters.

507
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,080
Right now?

508
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:25,362
Captain Ye. This is our work. Please cooperate us.

509
00:28:25,362 --> 00:28:27,280
Besides, we need your ID card.

510
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:29,260
We'll keep it for you temporarily.

511
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:33,240
Please, Captain Ye.

512
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:40,980
Wait a moment.

513
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:43,080
Can you let my teammate
attend the competition first?

514
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:47,000
After the competition, I'll accompany him to the
League and receive investigation.

515
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:56,022
This is our first time in the Challenge.

516
00:28:56,022 --> 00:28:59,188
Perhaps we're not quite familiar
with many procedures here.

517
00:28:59,188 --> 00:29:01,480
But every procedure was done
by me. It's none of their business.

518
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:04,560
How about this? I'll go to the headquarters with you.

519
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:10,600
For E-sports players, every round of competition is critical.

520
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:14,500
But for the League, truth and fairness are more important.

521
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:16,480
Please follow us, Captain Ye.

522
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:25,760
I'll come back soon.

523
00:29:28,365 --> 00:29:32,400
Lao Wei. I won't be able to stay here. Everything will have to count on you.

524
00:29:33,382 --> 00:29:34,251
Lao Ye.

525
00:29:34,251 --> 00:29:36,320
Captain, we're here waiting for you.

526
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:40,274
 

527
00:29:40,274 --> 00:29:42,340
Ye Xiu? Shouldn't it be Ye Qiu?

528
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:45,960
Beautiful female player fixes
the Best Newcomer in advance.

529
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:47,640
The price we set last time...

530
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:48,880
No problem.

531
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:52,083
If you did it well, we can sign a contract
as soon as the competition's over.

532
00:29:53,554 --> 00:29:56,988
Boss, I got something to tell you.

533
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,820
Change the application form immediately.

534
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:11,960
Qiao Yi Fan replaces Wu Chen for the first round.

535
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,260
Why?

536
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:20,560
Don't waste time on asking. Trust me.

537
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:26,020
All right. Spectators here and friends
who are watching our live telecast,

538
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:29,121
hello and welcome to the competition site of the last round of

539
00:30:29,121 --> 00:30:31,980
Regular Season of the Ninth Glory Challenge.

540
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:33,520
I'm the host Luo.

541
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:38,284
Today we'll see the combat
between Team Xing Xin and Team Zhu Xian.

542
00:30:38,284 --> 00:30:41,041
Welcome to the Glory Challenge.

543
00:30:41,041 --> 00:30:43,021
Hi, guys. I'm your old friend Pan Lin.

544
00:30:43,021 --> 00:30:44,820
Hi, I'm Ruo Feng.

545
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:46,680
There're two teams that will
attend today's competition.

546
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:49,288
They're old hand Team Zhu Xian, one of the strongest teams in Challenge...

547
00:30:49,288 --> 00:30:51,600
You'd better not play in this round.

548
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:54,541
Our game is going to start.

549
00:30:54,541 --> 00:30:57,620
Let's looking forward to the excellent
performance of these two teams.

550
00:30:57,620 --> 00:30:59,522
Captain's not here.

551
00:30:59,522 --> 00:31:01,960
We need to follow We Chen's instruction.

552
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:06,828
It's all right. I'll wait for Captain.

553
00:31:06,828 --> 00:31:09,800
In the first round, Team Xing
Xin appointed player Qiao Yi Fan.

554
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:12,891
As for Team Zhu Xian, we
got player Zheng Shengchao.

555
00:31:12,891 --> 00:31:16,622
Let's invite them to prepare on the stage.

556
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:25,140
Come on, Yi Fan!

557
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:30,020
Come on!

558
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:36,660
Come on!

559
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,220
Take it easy and try your best.

560
00:31:40,125 --> 00:31:40,199
Our two players have been on the stage now.

561
00:31:40,199 --> 00:31:42,021
 
Our two players have been on the stage now.

562
00:31:42,021 --> 00:31:45,934
Please get into the competition room
for preparation.

563
00:31:45,934 --> 00:31:49,238
Team Xing Xin appointed their Ghost, Qiao Yi Fan again for the first round.

564
00:31:49,238 --> 00:31:51,474
Let's looking forward
to the growth of this newcomer.

565
00:31:51,474 --> 00:31:54,582
The player from Team Zhu Xian is also a Ghost.

566
00:31:54,582 --> 00:31:56,251
It's a combat between two
players from the same profession.

567
00:31:56,251 --> 00:31:58,040
Let's expect!

568
00:31:58,040 --> 00:31:59,278
Last round of the Glory Challenge.

569
00:31:59,278 --> 00:32:00,600
Team Xing Xin vs. Team Zhu Xian.

570
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:02,468
Individual Event starts!

571
00:32:02,468 --> 00:32:04,820
The map is the Arena in the Place of Exile.

572
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:06,951
We can see at the very beginning,
Yi Cun Hui moves first.

573
00:32:06,951 --> 00:32:09,820
He's scouting the Arena during moving.

574
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:12,137
Good. Yi Cun Hui has detoured
to the rear of Anxious Ghost.

575
00:32:12,137 --> 00:32:14,920
His move and choice look more like an assassin,
rather than a Ghostblade.

576
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:16,740
Now if Yi Cun Hui sang the ghost array,

577
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:19,510
Anxious Ghost would be thrown into passivity.

578
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:27,736
The Ghostblade of Team Zhu Xian hasn't found that

579
00:32:27,736 --> 00:32:28,840
his rival has already been in his rear.

580
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:30,940
It's a bit reckless. Yi Cun Hui is going to attack.

581
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:34,208
It seems that he's not
going to sing the ghost array.

582
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:41,668
Move!

583
00:32:41,668 --> 00:32:43,340
Yi Cun Hui gave up the chance
of singing the ghost array.

584
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:45,900
He made a melee attack using
ghost array and ghost-chop.

585
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:49,536
But it appears that flaw was exposed to Yi Cun Hui
on purpose by Anxious Ghost.

586
00:32:49,536 --> 00:32:51,780
What a pity! It's a bit early for Yi Fan
to make a sneak attack.

587
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:54,800
If he could wait a moment, his rival might lose his balance.

588
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:57,242
Go for wool and come home shorn.

589
00:32:57,920 --> 00:33:01,400
He's the first one. It must be
stressful under such circumstance.

590
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:13,133
Yi Cun Hui is very familiar with this arena, so he escaped successfully.

591
00:33:13,133 --> 00:33:15,811
Anxious Ghost lost his goal.

592
00:33:35,862 --> 00:33:38,740
Look, right now Yi Cun Hui is
still hiding on the top of the wall.

593
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:40,742
It appears that he's still
observing the surroundings.

594
00:33:40,742 --> 00:33:42,814
It isn't a long distance between
Anxious Ghost and Yi Cun Hui.

595
00:33:42,814 --> 00:33:44,342
And the former is moving toward the latter.

596
00:33:44,342 --> 00:33:46,800
That's a good chance!

597
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:00,040
But I don't understand what is he waiting for?

598
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:01,520
Anxious Ghost is quite near him.

599
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:03,080
He can make a sneak attack at any time.

600
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:05,101
Oh, no! Yi Cun Hui's location is exposed by his shadow.

601
00:34:05,101 --> 00:34:07,040
Anxious Ghost has discovered!

602
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:09,381
What? Anxious Ghost didn't dodge. He got hit!

603
00:34:09,381 --> 00:34:11,350
What happened?
