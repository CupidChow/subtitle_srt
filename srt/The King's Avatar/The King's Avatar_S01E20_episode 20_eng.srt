 "Light From the Ashes" - Cai Wei Ze 

2
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:06,170
♫  Countless fireflies born from insignificance  ♫

3
00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:10,120
♫  Riding the long wind to gather into a shining galaxy  ♫

4
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:13,920
♫  Proclaim to the world on top of the sky  ♫

5
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:19,970
♫  We will return in glory  ♫

6
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:23,790
♫  Clear the clouds and descend with the heat  ♫

7
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:27,420
♫  Melting ice and snow, overcoming twists and turns  ♫

8
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:31,090
♫  Finally at this moment of peak  ♫

9
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:35,290
♫  There is a figure that coincides with the past  ♫

10
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:39,080
♫  The glory of the past that never came  ♫

11
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:42,610
♫  The pride that the future will never pass  ♫

12
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:46,390
♫  Our fingertips intertwined and condensed  ♫

13
00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:50,430
♫  Into a song that ignited the battlefield  ♫

14
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:54,150
♫  The only light in an endless night  ♫

15
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:58,000
♫  Is you and me who overcame mediocrity  ♫

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,980
♫  Up on the clouds and down in the dust  ♫

17
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:05,650
♫  Fireflies making every effort to illuminate  ♫

18
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:09,580
♫  I came from the legend to carry on a legend  ♫

19
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:13,490
♫  Once it's disruptive, a decade of persistence won't be in vain  ♫

20
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:17,400
♫  This battle is for everyone to remember  ♫

21
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:21,050
♫  This moment when we will be crowned in glory  ♫

22
00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:24,720
♫  This moment when we will be crowned in glory  ♫

23
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:28,140
   

24
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:32,580
   

25
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,800
Planning to give a hard blow.

26
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:46,904
That's good.

27
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:51,960
Get separated, and go back to their own position.

28
00:01:53,074 --> 00:01:55,960
Whether is good or not, it depends on your view.

29
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:59,894
Try again.

30
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,180
Hit here.

31
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:12,630
Actually, whether there exists a ball
which can push you, it's not important.

32
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:14,551
Focus on the present,

33
00:02:14,551 --> 00:02:18,102
and then the direction of the future
will be more clear.

34
00:02:18,102 --> 00:02:19,660
You...

35
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,006
What's your future direction?

36
00:02:23,006 --> 00:02:24,446
Me?

37
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:28,537
I just want to play billiards.

38
00:02:34,754 --> 00:02:39,180
I also just want to play billiards.

39
00:02:40,797 --> 00:02:44,080
Why do you bother to work
in such a small net cafe?

40
00:02:45,917 --> 00:02:48,060
If you want to restart,

41
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:50,990
you can choose whatever team you want.

42
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:53,590
Because there is a group of people who like Glory.

43
00:02:54,151 --> 00:02:56,108
Glory is their world.

44
00:02:56,108 --> 00:02:58,353
What does it have to do with you?

45
00:02:59,505 --> 00:03:01,914
In fact, I'm just one of them.

46
00:03:04,213 --> 00:03:05,782
Great.

47
00:03:05,782 --> 00:03:07,708
That's hard. Let's play again.

48
00:03:07,708 --> 00:03:09,400
Don't forget.

49
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:12,757
You were one of them too.

50
00:03:13,876 --> 00:03:15,711
Yes.

51
00:03:15,711 --> 00:03:20,560
There was a time
where we simply played billiards happily.

52
00:03:24,699 --> 00:03:26,514
That's good.

53
00:03:26,514 --> 00:03:29,622
Why did I listen to your words at that time?

54
00:03:29,622 --> 00:03:33,006
Now I can only see
the bastard occupy the position.

55
00:03:33,006 --> 00:03:35,820
Rather than spending the time on finding the evidence to prove that he framed you,

56
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:39,473
It's better to focus on the training and keep your own ranking.

57
00:03:40,262 --> 00:03:44,913
One day, you will encounter him on your way.

58
00:03:44,913 --> 00:03:46,090
Dammit.

59
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:48,480
If I encounter him,

60
00:03:49,936 --> 00:03:52,696
only I could be the winner.

61
00:03:54,686 --> 00:03:56,573
Excellent.

62
00:03:57,456 --> 00:03:59,462
We have made the deal.

63
00:03:59,462 --> 00:04:04,420
After I win, you will own me an equipment.

64
00:04:05,197 --> 00:04:07,340
Talk about it after you have won.

65
00:04:16,046 --> 00:04:19,628
You haven't answered my question.

66
00:04:19,628 --> 00:04:24,422
UCI offer a chance
of one -year professional E-sports training.

67
00:04:24,422 --> 00:04:25,406
Will you go?

68
00:04:25,406 --> 00:04:27,900
Why is me?

69
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:30,410
Members of Team One need
to participate in the competition.

70
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:33,660
Such a long-term exchange program is best for players like you

71
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:37,130
who never enter the competition before.

72
00:04:38,803 --> 00:04:42,157
When I come back, can I come into Team One?

73
00:04:44,213 --> 00:04:45,339
That's rascally.

74
00:04:45,339 --> 00:04:47,296
You have owned me one equipment.

75
00:04:47,296 --> 00:04:49,246
When do you give it to me?

76
00:04:49,246 --> 00:04:51,511
After you come back from abroad?

77
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:54,640
I haven't said I will go abroad.

78
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,914
After you come back,

79
00:04:56,914 --> 00:04:59,525
I will give you a silver equipment.

80
00:04:59,525 --> 00:05:01,797
Silver equipment?

81
00:05:01,797 --> 00:05:04,910
You mean the silver equipment that only the members of Team One could have?

82
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:08,500
Write down the IOU.

83
00:05:13,683 --> 00:05:16,122
Write it down clearly.

84
00:05:16,122 --> 00:05:18,433
Don't try to escape.

85
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,440
You don't trust me?

86
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:22,371
I trust you.

87
00:05:22,877 --> 00:05:25,173
But you still write IOU.

88
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:33,810
Write that you own Qiu Fei a silver equipment.

89
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:35,520
Wait. Write that,

90
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:39,330
You own Qiu Fei, the regular
of Jia Shi, a silver equipment.

91
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:40,980
Okay?

92
00:05:43,116 --> 00:05:45,054
I own you this.

93
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:49,800
 

94
00:05:55,683 --> 00:05:57,925
Debts that you own me,

95
00:05:57,925 --> 00:06:00,243
When do you plan to pay?

96
00:06:03,563 --> 00:06:06,660
You own me a glory.

97
00:06:08,059 --> 00:06:11,628
You will fight the glory back on your own.

98
00:06:11,628 --> 00:06:14,102
What? Want to go back on your words?

99
00:06:14,102 --> 00:06:15,803
Right.

100
00:06:19,117 --> 00:06:23,620
So that I have reasons to entangle you.

101
00:06:27,259 --> 00:06:29,020
I will give you.

102
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,137
You saw him?

103
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:40,936
I guess he must lesson you brashly.

104
00:06:40,936 --> 00:06:44,060
Just like he changed PK into
a competition for guidance.

105
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:46,370
Always insulting others.

106
00:06:49,794 --> 00:06:52,059
Qiu Fei, amazing.

107
00:06:52,059 --> 00:06:54,914
You still want to improve yourself at this moment.

108
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:58,016
Pitifully, the things you copied are useless.

109
00:06:58,016 --> 00:07:00,860
The tactics of Ye Qiu are out of date.

110
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:05,820
I am very happy that you come back from abroad.

111
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:09,940
With you joining in, it's just
like adding wings to a tiger.

112
00:07:15,425 --> 00:07:18,348
We are both the victims of Ye Qiu.

113
00:07:18,348 --> 00:07:21,271
Why not working together?

114
00:07:21,271 --> 00:07:26,097
His vulnerable team can't last for a few days.

115
00:07:37,031 --> 00:07:39,280
Jia Shi has changed the captain.

116
00:07:41,154 --> 00:07:43,420
You don't deserve mentioning Ye Qiu.

117
00:07:50,908 --> 00:07:52,822
This is for giving you a lesson.

118
00:07:52,822 --> 00:07:55,120
Later, if I hear it again,

119
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,968
I will beat you again.

120
00:08:05,917 --> 00:08:09,534
Tang, Yi Fan, Bao Zi, they are all not here.

121
00:08:09,534 --> 00:08:12,133
I feel a little lonely.

122
00:08:12,133 --> 00:08:14,434
Kinda miss them.

123
00:08:14,434 --> 00:08:18,423
To them, this is an important choice for their life.

124
00:08:19,234 --> 00:08:21,185
They should be prudent.

125
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:34,348
Yi Fan, good news.

126
00:08:34,348 --> 00:08:36,256
You don't have to go to the training camp.

127
00:08:36,256 --> 00:08:39,283
The captain says he wants to tell you something.

128
00:08:39,283 --> 00:08:42,520
Keep your training in the team.

129
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:45,020
I wan to go somewhere else.

130
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:48,440
Practicing The Array Ghost.

131
00:08:49,794 --> 00:08:51,388
Manager, what are you saying?

132
00:08:51,388 --> 00:08:53,985
The company plans to give you promotion.

133
00:08:53,985 --> 00:08:56,500
You are in charge of this area.

134
00:08:59,105 --> 00:09:01,360
Please let me calm down.

135
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,920
This is the last day of the invitation.

136
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,020
Have you decided yet?

137
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,000
Yes.

138
00:09:11,026 --> 00:09:13,400
I have made the decision.

139
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:16,094
Let me do it.

140
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:25,900
The little devil just came, right?

141
00:09:26,791 --> 00:09:29,357
Jia Shi plans to how to arrange him?

142
00:09:29,357 --> 00:09:32,720
In terms of his temper, whatever the arrangement of the team is,

143
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:36,380
he can achieve anything as long as it is what he wants.

144
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:42,840
Actually, no matter Qiu Fei, or other people,

145
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,576
They want to follow you.

146
00:09:44,576 --> 00:09:47,376
It doesn't mean you have
to be responsible for their life.

147
00:09:47,376 --> 00:09:50,040
They just want to Play Glory with you.

148
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,800
Since they have made the choice,

149
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:55,099
each of them has to be responsible
for his own life.

150
00:09:55,099 --> 00:09:56,880
Right?

151
00:09:57,714 --> 00:10:01,000
 

152
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,920
 ♫ Sailing with the wind
and converge into the Milky Way ♫ 

153
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:08,740
 ♫ Standing on the top and claiming that ♫ 

154
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:11,580
 ♫ We will regain our glory ♫ 

155
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:16,034
If you love Glory,
please love everything it brings to you.

156
00:10:16,034 --> 00:10:20,600
No matter it is pain, setback, or tears.

157
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:23,117
I can't be responsible for your life.

158
00:10:23,117 --> 00:10:27,060
But I'm willing to become your choice.

159
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:31,380
Because where the sword points, Is our glory.

160
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:37,620
 ♫ The pride in the future ♫ 

161
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:41,420
Boss,

162
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:45,283
 ♫ Composing the great song of battlefield ♫ 

163
00:10:45,283 --> 00:10:47,037
Senior.

164
00:10:47,037 --> 00:10:48,900
We are back.

00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:56,780
 ♫ Above the cloud, in the dust ♫ 

167
00:10:56,780 --> 00:11:00,620
 ♫ We are the brightest fireflies ♫ 

168
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:04,360
 ♫ I came from the past
and will write the furture ♫ 

169
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:08,140
 ♫ The rising wave of our ten years' effort ♫ 

170
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:12,100
 ♫ This fight, we will make it memorable ♫ 

171
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:17,140
 ♫ The glorious moment of coronation ♫ 

172
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,440
Yes.

173
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:29,000
I have to say, the weight in my mind, is finally unloaded.

174
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,700
You have no confidence of me?

175
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:38,140
As for things about the team, I can definitely take care of them.

176
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:42,330
Handle them. Won't cause any trouble at the critical moment.

177
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:51,900
It's for encouragement. Keep on.

178
00:11:53,445 --> 00:11:57,980
Isn't it something cheap bought in the street? And use it to fool me, right?

179
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:01,700
It seems so worn and old.

180
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,700
It's indeed second-handed.

181
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:08,340
When it is given to you, It will be third-handed.

182
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:13,970
Master, can you be a little sincere when you send gifts.

183
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:23,400
The badge of the first league.

184
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,160
Awesome.

185
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:32,360
This can be regarded as an antique.

186
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:34,901
Ordinary players can hardly collect it.

187
00:12:34,901 --> 00:12:37,840
Am I an ordinary player?

188
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:40,680
Why not saying it earlier?

189
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:43,700
I almost miss the priceless gift.

190
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,940
Thank you. I like this second-handed gift very much.

191
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:52,680
By the way, I also prepare a gift for you.

192
00:12:58,654 --> 00:13:00,820
What is it?

193
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:05,540
New beginning.

194
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,800
What is it?

195
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,940
New beginning.

196
00:13:23,813 --> 00:13:25,400
The gift has been sent.

197
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:27,600
The people upstairs are also here.

198
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:31,880
Since tomorrow, the mission
of the new year will also begin.

199
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,285
Your order.

200
00:13:34,285 --> 00:13:36,251
Give me the gizzards.

201
00:13:37,641 --> 00:13:39,310
- Now. Now. 
 -  Here. Take it.

202
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:47,400
We met each other in Glory
and got together in Xing Xin.

203
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:50,400
In the long future, please render your help.

204
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,979
Cheers.

205
00:13:51,979 --> 00:13:53,400
Wait.

206
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,100
I almost forget an important thing.

207
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:57,210
- Important? 
 - Important thing?

208
00:13:57,210 --> 00:13:59,500
Boss, since today,

209
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:04,000
Ye Xiu and Jun Mo Xiao
will always be with Xing Xin.

210
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:11,420
After the team is formed, it needs to unify the management of the account cards.

211
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,883
But you don't need to be so urgent.

212
00:14:14,883 --> 00:14:16,770
Tang Rou, Han Yan Rou
will always be with Xing Xin.

213
00:14:16,770 --> 00:14:18,650
Bao Zi, the Invader will always be with Xing Xin.

214
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:21,920
Qiao Yi Fan, Yi Cun Hui
will always be with Xing Xin.

215
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:26,220
 ♫ It's a long and bumpy road towards the top ♫ 

216
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:28,760
- Can he find a boss? 
 - He can.

217
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:31,230
- Who? 
 - Me.

218
00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:36,280
 ♫ Even if I am beat black and blue ♫ 

219
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:40,740
 ♫ there is always hope rising from desperation ♫ 

220
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,914
since this is what you thought,

221
00:14:43,914 --> 00:14:46,940
and so did they, then I'm out.

222
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:49,600
You always give up halfway anyway.

223
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:53,000
Since you are unwilling to do it, then don't force yourself.

224
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,380
I am

225
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:56,300
the manager of Team Xing Xin.

226
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:59,600
I am the manager of Team Xing Xin.

227
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:03,120
I am willing to fight with you to the end.

228
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,780
Thank you.

229
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:08,981
I will not fail your expectation.

230
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:17,300
- Thank you. 
 - Xing Xin are bound to win.

231
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:18,597
Glory will never die out.

232
00:15:18,597 --> 00:15:22,203
- Challenge, 
 - we are coming!

233
00:15:22,203 --> 00:15:24,740
Since the establishment of the League,

234
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:28,700
there is only one ultimate goal of all players.

235
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:31,440
That is the championship trophy of Glory.

236
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:35,200
The ultimate throne of all players,

237
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:39,900
will have a new owner today.

238
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:44,000
We take the crown. Long life Xing Xin.

239
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:48,080
Next, please welcome my dear teammates.

240
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:50,620
Please welcome Qiao Yi Fan.

241
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:54,260
Thank you to the league for giving us this trophy.

242
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:57,080
We will make persistent efforts.

243
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:59,261
That is too official. Come. Next one.

244
00:15:59,263 --> 00:16:01,770
I'd better not.

245
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:03,737
Next one. Next one. Come here now.

246
00:16:03,737 --> 00:16:05,860
Actually, I have so much to say.

247
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:09,920
But the one I want to thank most is our boss.

248
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:12,760
I think it's not an end,

249
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:15,800
but a beginning.

250
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:18,060
Next champion, next champion of the next,

251
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:19,760
will all belong to Xing Xin.

252
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:22,748
- Great. 
 - Yes.

253
00:16:22,748 --> 00:16:25,100
How about this shooting? Is it good?

254
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:27,820
- Have a look. 
 - Have a look.

255
00:16:29,486 --> 00:16:31,700
Perfect.

256
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:33,990
- Underling, what are you doing, underling? 
 - Does it a little joggle?

257
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:36,000
Remember this feeling.

258
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,486
Try again, okay?

259
00:16:37,486 --> 00:16:39,720
- Okay. Let's go. 
 - You are so annoying.

260
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:43,290
Isn't it tiring to act so many times? The Academy Award owns you an Oscar.

261
00:16:43,290 --> 00:16:45,100
Don't be so dramatic.

262
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:46,800
Not anyone can have the championship trophy.

263
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:49,045
- Right. 
 - That trophy,

264
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:53,700
I had it three times.

265
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:58,200
Apart from the fact that it's too heavy, it's just so-so.

266
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,917
- Really? 
 - I don't know.

267
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:05,040
- How about joining us in the shooting? 
 - Yes.

268
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,940
- Come and join us.  
 - Join us.

269
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:08,900
Come.

270
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:11,820
When we take the crown, Let's lift the pure gold championship trophy.

271
00:17:15,050 --> 00:17:17,240
Hello, everybody. I'm Xiao Lu.

272
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:20,103
This is the twelfth game of this regular season in the eighth season of Glory.

273
00:17:20,103 --> 00:17:21,820
Jia Shi vs. Thunderbolt.

274
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:23,500
This is an epic battle.

275
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:27,520
Why? You will know later.

276
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,350
When it comes to Thunderbolt, its captain, Xiao Shi Qin,

277
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:31,080
is one of the four tacticians.

278
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:33,860
Always leads his team to
overcame the stronger one.

279
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:36,680
His role, the mechanic Sheng Ling Mie.

280
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,330
Is also a S-level role in Glory.

281
00:17:38,330 --> 00:17:39,720
It's the core of tactics of Thunderbolt.

282
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:42,400
As for Team Jia Shi, it is led by Sun Xiang, the Rookie.

283
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:46,060
His role Leaf of Autumn is called God of Fights.

284
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:48,300
The contest starts now!

285
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:49,993
The players enter into the map.

286
00:17:49,993 --> 00:17:52,440
The team tournament and relegation battle

287
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:53,582
between Jia Shi and Thunderbolt begins right now.

288
00:17:53,582 --> 00:17:56,010
Although Thunderbolt has Xiao Shi Qin, one of the four tacticians,

289
00:17:56,010 --> 00:17:58,257
members of Thunderbolt don't
have enough personal ability.

290
00:17:58,257 --> 00:18:00,200
They also enter into the
relegation zone pitifully.

291
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:02,900
Jia Shi changed its captain, but didn't make any progress.

292
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:04,900
It also could be relegated.

293
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:06,120
Why not being afraid of the relegation?

294
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:08,770
Come back again by killing monsters and leveling.

295
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,400
You think it's like playing
the dungeon, don't you?

296
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,700
Killing monsters and leveling? Shame on you.

297
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:16,300
Only twenty teams will be left in this season.

298
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:18,600
If the team is at the bottom,
he can't even keep his seat.

299
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,480
- How could they lift the level? 
 - So...

300
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:23,760
Tonight, either Jia Shi or Thunderbolt will be relegated.

301
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:27,260
Yes. The relegated team will naturally

302
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:29,260
participate in the challenge of the next season.

303
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:33,020
Challenge. That is what
we are going to participate.

304
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:35,140
Achieve the champion of
the challenge is the only way

305
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:38,940
for the relegated team to come back to the league.

306
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:42,720
- So... 
 - The team which will be relegated tonight

307
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:45,100
will become our rival.

308
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:47,300
It's just a matter of time.

309
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:49,600
Even if we don't meet in the challenge,

310
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:53,300
we will still encounter each other in the league.

311
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:55,300
No matter which of them,

312
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:57,760
It will become our future rival.

313
00:19:00,993 --> 00:19:03,194
He is indeed worth of being called Rookie. Take away HOP of Thunderbolt.

314
00:19:03,194 --> 00:19:06,240
Thunderbolt will lose if this continues. Thunderbolt is in danger.

315
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:11,030
Jia Shi has had the game under control. At this critical point, Sun Xiang stands out.

316
00:19:11,030 --> 00:19:13,700
It's time to end.

317
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:16,460
I still can't tolerate Sun Xiang's arrogance.

318
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:18,160
It's not good for us if Jia Shi loses the game.

319
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,600
Nonsense.

320
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,800
I hope Jia Shi will lose. And go bankrupt right now.

321
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:23,500
According to the data,

322
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,200
Thunderbolt's capacity
is far lower than Jia Shi's.

323
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,840
It's not surprising that they will lose.

324
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:29,300
If we can choose a team as our rival,

325
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:31,740
I prefer Thunderbolt.

326
00:19:33,770 --> 00:19:36,249
Thunderbolt is retreating. Jia Shi is still chasing them.

327
00:19:36,249 --> 00:19:38,437
They don't want the substitution To join the main strength of Thunderbolt.

328
00:19:38,437 --> 00:19:41,600
Hi Fan, if you are Thunderbolt,

329
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:44,300
What will you do in such an unfavorable situation?

330
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:47,400
I will conserve my strength.

331
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,700
Wait for the chance.

332
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:50,300
Thunderbolt is running out of the time.

333
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:52,500
You have to create the chances for yourself.

334
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:56,200
Captain, you mean taking the initiative,

335
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:58,380
Containing their main force.

336
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:01,420
But that's too risky.

337
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:05,154
You are coming out yourself.

338
00:20:05,154 --> 00:20:07,520
Then I don't need to chase you.

339
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:13,120
Sheng Ling Mie.

340
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,840
He is

341
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:16,800
Xiao Shi Qin, the captain of Thunderbolt.

342
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:20,700
He leads Thunderbolt, a weak team gradually into the league.

343
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:22,550
He is the core of all the tactics of Thunderbolt.

344
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:29,625
Apart from the tactics, even in the mental aspect,

345
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:33,200
he is absolutely the leader of Thunderbolt.

346
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:40,133
Dragon soaring. Does Sun Xiang
want to expand his advantage?

347
00:20:40,133 --> 00:20:43,040
- Wonderful. 
 - That's the end.

348
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:45,420
Dragon soaring begins the bonus.

349
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:47,400
It seems he will use Dragon Head Rising.

350
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,019
You mean Sun Xiang will use Dragon Heads Rising?

351
00:20:49,019 --> 00:20:51,740
Dragon Head Rising. Sun Xiang should use the unique skill of Ye Qiu.

352
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:52,800
Dragon Head Rising.

353
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:56,100
What's going on? He should escape the Dragon Head Rising.

354
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:58,285
Sheng Ling Mie uses the
step-back of the mechanical punch,

355
00:20:58,285 --> 00:21:00,140
Escaping the damage of Dragon soaring immediately.

356
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:01,714
What the hell is that?

357
00:21:01,714 --> 00:21:04,241
Just now, we saw that Sun Xiang used Dragon Head Rising.

358
00:21:04,241 --> 00:21:05,950
But it's also the first time we saw that Someone

359
00:21:05,950 --> 00:21:08,800
- could break the Dragon Head Rising. 
 - The captain of Thunderbolt.

360
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:11,880
He should break Dragon Head Rising. How could that be possible?

361
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:13,640
Nothing is impossible.

362
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:18,220
Dragon Head Rising is not unbreakable.

363
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,800
You have known the solution.

364
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:27,300
This skill from the beginning to the end constitutes seventy eight frames.

365
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:30,360
The only flaw Is hidden in the forty-second frame.

366
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:32,060
This is unavoidable when the player uses it.

367
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:34,133
It's hard to find it.

368
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:40,200
I guess he watched the playback for thousands of times.

369
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:43,100
And finally found this solution.

370
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:45,880
This is really his style.

371
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:48,700
Leaf of Autumn is in danger. It takes too long to end Dragon Soaring.

372
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:52,120
Find one in about seventy frames.

373
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:54,900
His sight is too good.

374
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:58,370
It's his effort, not his sight.

375
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:03,000
This guy is too frightening.

376
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:07,720
Any skill is meaningful only when
it is used at the right time.

377
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:10,600
Otherwise, it will become the flaw.

378
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:15,480
This time, Sun Xiang suffers from showing his virtuosity.

379
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:20,294
Lumbricus Tactic. From now on, fight back with all forces.

380
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:25,180
We see that Thunderbolt begins to fight back at once.
Lay siege to Leaf of Autumn.

381
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:31,780
Xiao Shi Qin of Thunderbolt Is famous for overcoming the stronger rivals.

382
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:35,400
Once he finds the flaw, he won't let it go.

383
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:38,220
If Sun Xiang didn't use
Dragon Head Rising just now,

384
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:40,860
maybe Thunderbolt would have lost the game.

385
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:44,660
Pitifully, there is no "if" in the competition.

386
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:47,120
The result has come out.

387
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:48,420
Jia Shi is in danger.

388
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:51,240
The time is running out.

389
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:52,341
Make it.

390
00:22:52,341 --> 00:22:54,260
Thunderbolt successfully
takes Leaf of Autumn away.

391
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:56,780
Meanwhile, team HP of Thunderbolt
is higher than that of Jia Shi.

392
00:22:56,780 --> 00:22:59,160
Time is up. Game over.

393
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:01,025
Thunderbolt keeps its seat.

394
00:23:01,025 --> 00:23:03,161
That's splendid. We have witnessed the history again.

395
00:23:03,161 --> 00:23:05,040
Thunderbolt achieved its
comeback in the desperate situation.

396
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:07,680
At the last moment, they won the game.

397
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:10,920
It's Thunderbolt that
keeps its seat in the league.

398
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:14,260
Jia Shi is relegated.

399
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:18,880
- So we will... 
 - Congratulations to Thunderbolt again.

400
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,791
They achieve the final victory.

401
00:23:20,791 --> 00:23:24,540
We also feel very pitiful to Jia Shi,
the great team in the past.

402
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:25,520
We won.

403
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,060
They are relegated from the league.

404
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:30,100
They will begin from the challenge
in the next season.

405
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:33,880
We also thank our audience for your support.

406
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:36,680
We will see you again at the ninth pro-league.

407
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:38,266
Bye-bye.

408
00:23:48,063 --> 00:23:48,911
We won. We won.

409
00:23:48,911 --> 00:23:51,160
The cooperation was great just now.

410
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:51,905
Great.

411
00:23:51,905 --> 00:23:53,179
Not bad. Not bad.

412
00:23:53,179 --> 00:23:54,461
- Come and have a rest.
- Well done.

413
00:23:54,461 --> 00:23:57,260
Captain, where do we go to celebrate tonight?

414
00:23:57,260 --> 00:23:58,460
I won't go tonight.

415
00:23:58,460 --> 00:24:00,810
I know, among all the teams in the league,

416
00:24:00,810 --> 00:24:02,120
as for which is the most diligent,

417
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:04,520
if Thunderbolt ranks second,
then there will be no team ranking first.

418
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:09,694
Tonight, we must open a summing-up meeting,
celebrating it later.

419
00:24:19,542 --> 00:24:20,520
What's going on?

420
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:22,620
The...

421
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:30,780
Starting from today,

422
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:33,560
I won't be your captain.

423
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:35,320
- What?
- What?

424
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:39,080
Captain, this joke is not funny.

425
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,760
What's going on?

426
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:49,620
This is the tactics of all teams in the league
and coping strategies

427
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:51,160
that I have summarized for years.

428
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:53,200
You will use them in the future.

429
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:57,040
I also add notes to all the tactics.

430
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:59,040
You can refer to it.

431
00:25:04,015 --> 00:25:07,000
After I leave,
the new captain will appear among you.

432
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,840
Please work hard, everyone.

433
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:09,460
- Captain.
- Captain.

434
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:13,671
What do you mean?
You want to transfer and leave Thunderbolt.

435
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:27,320
Captain. Captain.

436
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:31,300
Come out, Sun Xiang.

437
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:32,600
Members of Jia Shi,

438
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:34,460
pleas leave the competition room
as soon as possible.

439
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:39,320
Come out. Come out.

440
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:41,790
Come out. Come out.

441
00:25:57,242 --> 00:25:58,860
What are you doing? They are fans.

442
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:01,320
You will be scolded to death.

443
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:02,900
We lost the game.

444
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:04,840
Someone has to account for this.

445
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:06,440
Then who?

446
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:09,720
It's not that simple
that we just lost the game today.

447
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:12,000
It's relegation.

448
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,260
Then who should be blamed?

449
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:16,820
We just followed the tactics
that has been arranged.

450
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:20,920
Now, Jia Shi believes in individualism.

451
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:23,110
Powerless people like us

452
00:26:23,110 --> 00:26:26,700
can't decide the game
no matter we played well or not.

453
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:29,880
Today, someone insisted
on using Dragon Head Rising.

454
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:31,800
Is he ashamed?

455
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:33,388
Enough.

456
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:38,200
If you continue to pass the buck, suit yourself.

457
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,400
I won't join you.

458
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:41,600
Mu Cheng, we don't mean that.

459
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,106
We just don't want to lose
the game with no clear reasons.

460
00:26:43,106 --> 00:26:44,640
Shut up.

461
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:49,816
Come out. Come out.

462
00:26:49,816 --> 00:26:52,000
I am the captain.

463
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,920
I will be held accountable for this.

464
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:57,900
You think you bear all the
responsibility and that's enough?

465
00:26:57,900 --> 00:26:59,280
Jia Shi is relegated.

466
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:01,080
No one is innocent.

467
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:02,900
We lost the game.

468
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:05,140
We all have our own responsibility.

469
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:08,240
Including myself.

470
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:14,422
Come out. Come out.

471
00:27:14,422 --> 00:27:16,000
- Please calm down. 
 - How did you play?

472
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,371
Su Mu Cheng, The record of Jia Shi
was always very stable before.

473
00:27:18,371 --> 00:27:19,980
Why could it be relegated this time?

474
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:22,040
What does it have to do
with the captain, Sun Xiang?

475
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:23,080
Can you explain this?

476
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:24,247
Can you explain, Su Mu Cheng?

477
00:27:24,247 --> 00:27:26,930
Whether there is some problems?

478
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:31,320
Does the retirement of Ye Qiu
have a great influence on Jia Shi?

479
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:35,280
Order, please.

480
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:37,120
Please calm down guys.

481
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:40,136
Please calm down, guys.

482
00:27:40,136 --> 00:27:41,160
This is not your fault.

483
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:42,001
You are not the captain.

484
00:27:42,001 --> 00:27:43,980
Su Mu Cheng, don't leave.

485
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:47,780
Su Mu Cheng, why?

486
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:50,720
Mu Cheng. Mu Cheng. Su Mu Cheng.

487
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:51,638
Don't.

488
00:27:51,638 --> 00:27:53,740
We don't blame you. Su Mu Cheng.

489
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:56,540
Mu Cheng, don't leave.

490
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:21,551
Don't leave, Mu Cheng.

491
00:28:21,551 --> 00:28:23,400
Mu Cheng.

492
00:28:26,374 --> 00:28:27,537
Today's performance was so good. Yes.

493
00:28:27,537 --> 00:28:28,839
Jia Shi was too terrible today.

494
00:28:28,839 --> 00:28:30,000
Yes.

495
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,800
Great.

496
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:34,836
I take you to a familiar place.

497
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,280
What do you want?

498
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:44,360
- A cup of coffee.
- Okay.

499
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:45,480
Thank you.

500
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:47,980
This is the familiar place?

501
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:50,140
But we never come here before.

502
00:28:55,648 --> 00:28:56,800
Really?

503
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:59,331
You think I don't have enough of the game today?

504
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,000
You don't dare to come?

505
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,440
Let me clarify,

506
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:06,117
I am furious right now.

507
00:29:06,117 --> 00:29:08,170
I won't be softhearted.

508
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:28,060
This map?

509
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:31,919
You do remember it.

510
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:35,382
Of course. How could I forget it?

511
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:40,480
I don't lie to you. This is the familiar place.

512
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:43,640
I still remember my brother created this map.

513
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:46,340
And here, I played Glory for the first time.

514
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:57,740
 ♫ You'll share with me a bowl of instant noodles ♫ 

515
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:01,839
Right. Move.

516
00:30:01,839 --> 00:30:03,420
Yes. Yes. Yes.

517
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:06,202
Now use the cannonball of flotation.

518
00:30:06,202 --> 00:30:07,620
Throw the grenade and meanwhile change your gun.

519
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:08,580
This way. This way.

520
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:11,020
He is hiding here. Okay.

521
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:14,780
That's so cruel, Ye Xiu.

522
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:16,580
You such a despicable person.
Don't misguide my little sister.

523
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:19,400
Su Mu Qiu, really?

524
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:21,800
You design this map,
and now have stayed there for a while.

525
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:23,600
Shoot him. Shoot him.

526
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:25,517
You will pay for it. I am telling you.

527
00:30:25,517 --> 00:30:26,760
Okay.

528
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:28,960
Send that bomb back.

529
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:39,085
Why I can't move?

530
00:30:39,085 --> 00:30:40,660
I am asking you, why she can't move?

531
00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:42,605
Is there any bug here?

532
00:30:42,605 --> 00:30:44,640
Dammit. I have revised this map several times.

533
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:45,800
Why there is still bugs?

534
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:47,300
Entrap your own sister.

535
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:49,240
Right, Mu Cheng?

536
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:53,360
Every programmer makes progress
by fixing his bugs.

537
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:55,824
Failure is the ladder upwards success. Right?

538
00:30:55,824 --> 00:30:58,680
What ladder? Look at it yourself.

539
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:01,580
It should be called the desperate black hole.

540
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:12,360
 ♫ It's the eternal support in my heart ♫ 

541
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,540
It should be here.

542
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:15,940
It has been so many years.

543
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:18,480
That bug is the only flaw of my brother.

544
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:21,880
Now, it should have been fixed, right?

545
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:24,520
Who knows? Let's have a contest?

546
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:27,040
Okay. My force is quite strong right now.

547
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:28,908
Be careful.

548
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:14,680
Do you still remember how I taught you
to handle your brother?

549
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:16,220
How dare you talk about it!

550
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:18,420
After that game,
my brother forbade me from playing Glory.

551
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:20,596
He was afraid that you would mislead me.

552
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:23,520
I misled you?

553
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:25,960
You have been self-taught.

554
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:41,240
I am stuck. The bug is still here.

555
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:43,010
Let me have a look.

556
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:52,000
Where is this?

557
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,172
Go down there and we'll find out.

558
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:10,200
In the past six months,
I have never given up,

559
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:13,000
even though many things have happened.

560
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,800
Even without you by my side,

561
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:18,600
I realize that I need to rely on myself.

562
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:21,080
So I work harder than before.

563
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,800
But Jia Shi is

564
00:33:27,459 --> 00:33:29,459
still relegated.

565
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:38,360
What despairs me is not the relegation itself.

566
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:40,600
Instead, no matter how harder I tried,

567
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:45,680
Jia Shi nowadays made me feel powerless.

568
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:52,200
How to choose the future path
of the following year,

569
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:54,100
I am quite confused.

570
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:59,800
We are going downhill.

571
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:05,740
As for the future path, I don't know where to go.

572
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:18,400
Then focus on the path
you're walking on right now.

573
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:27,600
Aren't I going downhill?

574
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,840
Actually, at many moments of life,
it's like this stairs.

575
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:36,000
You think you are going downhill.

576
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,680
As long as you keep going,

577
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:39,500
when you turn around,

578
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:44,500
you will find that you've stood in a higher place.

579
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:57,800
There is no absolute boundary
between winning and losing.

580
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:00,440
As long as you keep going forward,

581
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:03,480
the nadir could be a high spot.

582
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:07,680
Our world is never a straight path.

583
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:12,900
There are ups and downs, winning and losing,

584
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:14,580
and no end.

585
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:21,400
The bug at that time has been fix by Mu Qiu.

586
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:23,800
And he left a bonus.

587
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:25,920
It is what you are seeing now.

588
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:27,800
Penrose stairs.

589
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:29,100
It still doesn't have a name.

590
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:32,200
You pick a name for it?

591
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:37,200
Then the name is

592
00:35:38,053 --> 00:35:39,853
Path of Glory.

593
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:45,880
Your taste of naming has improved.

594
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:48,520
At least, it's better than Leaf of Autumn.

595
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:49,820
Your ice cream.

596
00:35:49,820 --> 00:35:51,540
Thank you.

597
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:54,960
Xing Xin and Jia Shi.

598
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:57,900
They will definitely meet in the Challenge.

599
00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:00,240
Then...

600
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,100
welcome to becoming my rival.

601
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:18,860
Almost all the top players live in this floor.

602
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:22,040
This is Shen Jian's room.

603
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:23,920
Next lives Zhang Jia Xing.

604
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:26,291
Sun Xiang lives there.

605
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:31,500
This is Ye Qiu's room.

606
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:37,520
One, two, three, four.

607
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:41,500
I set the password. It's very simple.

608
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:44,600
In case that he will sleep
in the hallway at night.

609
00:36:45,763 --> 00:36:47,662
Come in.

610
00:36:54,626 --> 00:36:58,532
His room belongs to me now.

611
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:01,729
Welcome our old friend to live here.

612
00:37:01,729 --> 00:37:04,969
I never think we will be in one team.

613
00:37:10,068 --> 00:37:15,868
By the way, this board may be a little loose.

614
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:21,300
The table leg is not stable.

615
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:24,089
Especially this curtain. Don't pull it.

616
00:37:24,089 --> 00:37:26,189
Otherwise, it will be worse.

617
00:37:29,129 --> 00:37:31,169
Why are you guys

618
00:37:32,289 --> 00:37:34,375
not fixing them?

619
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:40,000
Maybe it's because we don't know how to fix them.

620
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,760
It was a good place.

621
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:45,680
But with time going by,
some small problems gradually occur.

622
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:47,280
Just like this room.

623
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:48,630
After it is empty for long,

624
00:37:48,630 --> 00:37:51,700
it becomes a hollow room with nobody living here.

625
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:53,600
Right?

626
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:57,900
So here I come.

627
00:37:57,900 --> 00:38:00,665
The Jia Shi that remains to be fixed needs me.

628
00:38:00,665 --> 00:38:02,840
You're right.

629
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:05,988
Actually, the curtain only needs to change a hook.

630
00:38:05,988 --> 00:38:09,500
The table legs need to screw it up.

631
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:13,200
But the board has been totally broken.

632
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:15,360
I don't know how to fix it.

633
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:16,760
Fix it if possible.

634
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:18,680
Otherwise, replace it with a new one.

635
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:20,200
Replace?

636
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:24,100
Qiao Shi Qin, you are such a cruel guy.

637
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:27,500
You just came here. And have thought about cleaning up.

638
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:32,100
Don't misunderstand me.

639
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:34,200
I don't misunderstand you.

640
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:38,600
But as the old saying goes,
one nation can't have two queens.

641
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:39,760
Say away.

642
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:44,820
Whether you are here to help Mr. Tao
transfer the power of Sun Xiang?

643
00:38:48,087 --> 00:38:51,727
Enough. Don't try to pull it out of me.

644
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:55,100
I'm not here to transfer anyone's power.

645
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:02,700
I'm here to change the broken Jia Shi
into a new look.

646
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:06,300
How to change it?

647
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:12,000
Just like you said, change a screw.

648
00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:20,960
- Okay. Thank you.
- No problem.

649
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:33,680
- Give it to me.
- Okay.

650
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:36,000
No drinking during the competition.

651
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
This is the regulation.

652
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,580
But since you've started,

653
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:46,400
then might as well enjoy yourself.

654
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:51,640
One more glass.
The same as his, with spherical ice.

655
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:53,140
Here.

656
00:39:58,719 --> 00:40:03,519
Dilute with ice? Too low.

657
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:10,200
The ice represses
the light element in the alcohol,

658
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:14,700
which brings out
the stronger tasting elements more.

659
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:21,400
Sometimes, it can reach the result
that one plus one is more than two.

660
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:24,100
I'm the unique one.

661
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:26,800
I don't need to team up with anyone.

662
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:29,520
Of course not.

663
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:31,940
When genius players like you team up with others,

664
00:40:31,940 --> 00:40:34,860
it's more favorable for others.

665
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:39,640
It's not fair.

666
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:48,140
