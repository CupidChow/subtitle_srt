Real bad luck.

27
00:01:36,718 --> 00:01:38,568
I admit my defeat.

28
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:41,640
I'm ashamed to ask for a contract.

29
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,260
Bye!

30
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,330
An Wen Yi! Please wait.

31
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:53,980
An Wen Yi, wait.

32
00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:00,200
Captain, it was my fault.
I wasn't a good commander.

33
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,780
Stay.

34
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:09,860
I can grant your extra request.

35
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,230
I look forward to a smooth cooperation.

36
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:15,077
For the long-term development of our team,

37
00:02:15,077 --> 00:02:18,310
we need to cultivate new talents
for the second echelon.

38
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:21,085
Do you have plans about the future development?

39
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:26,740
It seems a little early
to talk about things far away.

40
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:32,950
Then let's talk about the present.

41
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:36,080
How should we pay An Wen Yi? Any idea?

42
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,190
I have to check the cost of the parties quickly

43
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:40,490
and sign a contract with him as soon as possible.

44
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:44,280
I haven't considered it yet.

45
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:47,910
Haven't considered?

46
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:54,400
These questions should be thought out
before the interview.

47
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:00,640
Look.

48
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:05,370
An Wen Yi's Exclusive Program.

49
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:08,290
There are three parts
in An Wen Yi's Exclusive Program.

50
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:12,400
Skills. Life. Mental health.

51
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,680
Three things need to be improved of his skills.

52
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,690
Pressure resistance training. 
  

53
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:20,080
Team work. Personal abilities.

54
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,630
About compression resistance training...

55
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:26,260
I understand all those. But...

56
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:28,605
Why mental health?

57
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:34,540
Mental health is the most important of all.

58
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:37,840
It will affect the whole team's morale.

59
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,040
How should we dissolve their negative emotions?

60
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:42,200
How should we stimulate
their passion when training?

61
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:46,020
How should we guide them to be self-disciplined?

62
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:49,560
When you are the bad cop and criticize them,

63
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:53,690
how should I vindicate your authority
as the captain?

64
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:56,210
Meanwhile, pacify their emotions?

65
00:03:56,210 --> 00:03:59,380
Isn't it important?

66
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:07,360
What are you doing?

67
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,340
To stop me from talking
by asking me to drink water?

68
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:13,460
I mean... Let's make tea liquor...

69
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:16,042
Toast to our good boss of Xing Xin!

70
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:24,130
This compliment has come a bit early.

71
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,360
Then let's toast to our boss...

72
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:31,740
who is not good enough
but wants to be good enough...

73
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:35,610
and who is not sure whether she'd be great...

74
00:04:36,928 --> 00:04:38,391
Toast to you!

75
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,360
Captain.

76
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,950
It's late. You still up?

77
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:51,048
I'm here to report to you.

78
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:53,285
Go ahead.

79
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:04,100
I've summed up what I didn't
do well in today's interview.

80
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:08,330
Number one, I didn't prepare enough.

81
00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:10,380
So I almost screwed things up.

82
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:13,408
Number two,
my performance in the training match was poor.

83
00:05:13,408 --> 00:05:17,708
Nearly missed a good Cleric for our team.

84
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:22,340
And...

85
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:24,640
Captain...

86
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:26,500
Do you think...

87
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:29,370
It's late. Get some rest.

88
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:47,920
Do you think I'm qualified to be the vice captain?

89
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,417
You're questioning yourself is because...

90
00:05:56,417 --> 00:05:59,631
you haven't found your huge potential.

93
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:49,640
That's the brief about Kongzhi Forest.

94
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:54,010
If we follow the position we've planned,
two team players will get through for sure.

95
00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:57,340
Yi Fan. Why use this array?

96
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,720
I'll explain.

97
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:02,180
There are two Witches in Team Wei Cao.

98
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:05,300
So they have a big attack range.

99
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:07,697
We'll have to disperse our positions.

100
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:11,730
Otherwise, we'll not break through.

101
00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:17,100
If we disperse our positions
and they divide and conquer,

102
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:18,991
- what should we do?
- Bao Zi, wait a sec.

103
00:07:18,991 --> 00:07:21,080
Let Yi Fan finish it.

104
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:23,130
Go on, Yi Fan.

105
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:25,440
So, let's make a plan first.

106
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:28,290
Deploy three team players
to surround the two Witches.

107
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:32,170
Then other team players can reach the terminus.

108
00:07:32,170 --> 00:07:35,710
But Gao Ying Jie and Wang Jie Xi
are very flexible.

109
00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:38,760
If we deploy three players
to surround two Witches,

110
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:42,280
the rest of us will face a
"two-against-three" battle.

111
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:44,120
It's much easier to collapse.

112
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:46,310
You asked me not to argue. But you're arguing now.

113
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:48,480
Yi Fan, relax, go on.

114
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,580
So...

115
00:07:51,168 --> 00:07:54,530
We'll have to protect the only Cleric of ours.

116
00:07:54,530 --> 00:07:56,550
I have a plan.

117
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:58,510
Protect An Wen Yi with
two players working together.

118
00:07:58,510 --> 00:08:01,002
What about the two Witches?

119
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:14,374
Were you really a former player in Wei Cao?

120
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:19,090
How did Wang Jie Xi gain the title of Magician?

121
00:08:19,090 --> 00:08:20,210
His tactics are very variable.

122
00:08:20,210 --> 00:08:23,910
When Wei Cao vs. Xing Xin,
would he use normal tactics?

123
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,360
Let's me put it this way.

124
00:08:33,310 --> 00:08:36,370
Right now, Xing Xin is just a grass-root team.

125
00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:38,360
As long as they kill the captain,

126
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:42,650
others will be defeated once and for all.

127
00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:45,650
So in my opinion, their first target should not be me.

128
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:48,130
It's...the captain.

129
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:50,850
Made sense.

130
00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:53,940
Let's wait for the captain.

131
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:56,340
Then hold the meeting, okay?

132
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:01,800
That's right. Where is the captain?

133
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,200
Master.

134
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:11,000
I'd come to apologize as
soon as I knew who you are.

135
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,650
But I was on a business trip. Just came back today.

136
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:16,257
So I'm late for 28 days, 7
hours, 6 minutes and 5 secs.

137
00:09:16,257 --> 00:09:18,320
I'd rather I was never late.

138
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,970
Mas...

139
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:24,200
- Keep a low key.
- Okay, okay.

140
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,060
Don't worry, please.

141
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:31,210
I'll keep it secret even though
I know you're the master.

142
00:09:31,210 --> 00:09:32,848
Good business trip meals!

143
00:09:32,848 --> 00:09:34,462
You've gained weight.

144
00:09:35,330 --> 00:09:37,580
Have I? It must be puffiness.

145
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:39,380
What I've been thinking is
how I should apologize to you.

146
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:41,280
Can't even eat or sleep.

147
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:44,280
Master. I'm sorry. I was blind.

148
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:47,425
Not only didn't recognize you, but also treated you as a network manager.

149
00:09:48,410 --> 00:09:50,020
These are hyacinth flavored cookies.

150
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:51,230
You can view them as me.

151
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:52,390
Forcibly open the package.

152
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:53,620
Squeeze it violently.

153
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:55,160
Take the cookies out vigorously.

154
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:56,860
Then squeeze them.

155
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:58,870
Whatever you want.

156
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:01,300
Stop it.

157
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:03,900
- What's more?
- Here.

158
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:05,930
It's a phone shell I especially prepared for you.

159
00:10:05,930 --> 00:10:07,130
Hope it'll be around you every day.

160
00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:10,150
It's one way to protect the heart broken by me.

161
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:13,200
Sounds good? It's pretty.

162
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,980
And...

163
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:20,080
Master, did you smell it? Smell it!

164
00:10:20,890 --> 00:10:24,020
You'll smell hyacinth in the air.

165
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:26,110
The smell will be surrounding you.

166
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:30,810
Listen! They are all saying one thing... on my behalf:

167
00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:32,468
I'm sorry.

168
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:36,490
Excuse me.

169
00:10:36,490 --> 00:10:39,220
I'm allergic to hyacinth.

170
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,391
Look at this. And this.

171
00:10:47,391 --> 00:10:48,900
And this.

172
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:52,560
Master... Could you please have a look?

173
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,720
I prepared all these hyacinth gifts.

174
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,670
I don't want to hear you apologize anymore.

175
00:10:56,670 --> 00:10:58,362
Cut the chase.

176
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:02,225
Why are you meeting me?

177
00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:06,260
Master, look at this.

178
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:07,700
 

179
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:09,850
- What's this?
- Someone wrote it for House of eSports.

180
00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:11,710
The chief editor plans to publish it tomorrow.

181
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:14,710
I'm worried it'd cause
adverse impacts on Xing Xin.

182
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:17,690
So I'm here to ask you to read it through.

183
00:11:17,690 --> 00:11:19,960
I heard when they were interviewing Wei Cao,

184
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:23,240
Wang Jie Xi said a former player in
Wei Cao would be in Tutor Selection.

185
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:26,180
What he did mean was Qiao Yi Fan could do well.

186
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:27,980
But the writer was interpreting out of context.

187
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:29,320
That was just for stunt.

188
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:32,130
Look at the title. Who wouldn't be mad when reading this?

189
00:11:32,130 --> 00:11:33,780
 

190
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:35,950
It is provoking.

191
00:11:35,950 --> 00:11:38,540
Exactly! So I have an assumption.

192
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:40,720
Someone is targeting Xing Xin.

193
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,580
They aim at creating public pressure.

194
00:11:43,650 --> 00:11:44,900
It's possible.

195
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:46,100
Am I right?

196
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:49,560
As a rookie, he'd be easily
destroyed by the public voice.

197
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:51,570
So, if the essay came out,

198
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:54,922
it'd make influence on Qiao Yi Fan's performance.

199
00:11:54,922 --> 00:11:56,960
It makes sense.

200
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,740
Thank you!

201
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:02,120
To be honest, I hate unfair competitions.

202
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:05,140
They should focus more on
training instead of these tricks.

203
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:06,514
Right?

204
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,770
So, in your opinion...

205
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:11,540
What should we do?

206
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:14,880
Master. Don't worry. I've got a plan.

207
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,300
No matter what the director says,

208
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:20,620
if you want to cancel it, I'll
make sure it won't be published!

209
00:12:22,570 --> 00:12:23,985
Publish it.

210
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:27,850
- But... 
 - As a professional player,

211
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:30,440
learning to face questions...

212
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:32,500
is something he must do.

213
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:43,137
Master! Wait!

214
00:12:43,137 --> 00:12:44,810
 

215
00:12:44,810 --> 00:12:46,310
You don't want to hear it.

216
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:49,068
  How about just looking at it?

217
00:12:57,008 --> 00:12:59,640
 

218
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:02,420
Captain. I've thought about everything thoroughly.

219
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:05,160
An Wen Yi is very important
in the competition days later.

220
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:07,540
If we want Xiao An to do his best,

221
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:10,797
we should buy him a set of new equipment.

222
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:17,105
I'm afraid my salary is not enough for it.

223
00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:20,320
If we can't...

224
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,570
Could we at least send Tang Rou to protect him?

225
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:25,794
Otherwise, Xiao An could be
our technological weakness.

226
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:30,251
It's not the only weakness.

227
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:34,670
If we can't send Tang Rou, could we send Bao Zi?

228
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:35,880
Bao Zi is flexible.

229
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:38,070
He can back up anytime.

230
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,960
Captain.

231
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:47,590
If... nothing would work...

232
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:50,177
we may have to change our tactics.

233
00:13:54,150 --> 00:13:58,630
I know what to do. I'll instruct you. You try to fix it.

234
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:00,120
Perfect.

235
00:14:00,765 --> 00:14:02,300
Come on.

236
00:14:05,334 --> 00:14:07,500
 

237
00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:10,720
Captain.

238
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,300
Are you teaching me how to fix the computer?

239
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:15,880
I won't. It will.

240
00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:23,380
Captain. I don't think so.

241
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:25,470
I might damage it.

242
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:28,617
If you think that way, bad thing will happen.

243
00:14:28,617 --> 00:14:30,611
What's that law?

244
00:14:30,611 --> 00:14:31,740
Murphy's law.

245
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:33,020
Start.

246
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:34,477
Here.

247
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:37,528
Pass me the book.

248
00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:41,785
Start from cable winding displacement.

249
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:44,762
Read this page.

250
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,582
Cable winding displacement...

251
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:02,260
Captain. Is it okay?

252
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:07,200
Something wrong with your routing. It's not artistic.

253
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:09,022
Artistic?

254
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:14,400
On this page.

255
00:15:19,637 --> 00:15:22,030
Captain. Is it okay?

256
00:15:24,850 --> 00:15:26,660
It's a mess.

257
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:29,680
It's... even worse...

258
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,250
Sit down.

259
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,610
You talked about everyone's problem.

260
00:15:35,610 --> 00:15:37,560
But left yours out.

261
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:39,510
You adopted others' suggestions.

262
00:15:39,510 --> 00:15:42,005
But never thought about your own feelings.

263
00:15:42,830 --> 00:15:44,850
Your task is not that complicated.

264
00:15:44,850 --> 00:15:47,825
What you need to do is fix the computer.

265
00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:56,090
Captain. I may know what to do.

266
00:15:56,090 --> 00:15:57,971
What should you do?

267
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:01,920
Hello. Is it Technician Wang?

268
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,010
Yes. We need you to fix the computer.

269
00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:06,310
No. 11 on the King's Avenue. Xing Xin Net Cafe.

270
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:08,740
It's an easier way. And more effective.

271
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,350
 

272
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:14,610
Was it a waste?

273
00:16:14,610 --> 00:16:15,943
  Was it extravagant?

274
00:16:15,943 --> 00:16:18,060
How could you do it?

275
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:24,250
You wasted your training time fixing the computer.

276
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:25,671
Wasn't it a waste? Wasn't it extravagant?

277
00:16:25,671 --> 00:16:27,531
Shouldn't you introspect yourselves?

278
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:31,070
Captain. Did we spend too much?

279
00:16:31,070 --> 00:16:33,370
- Don't talk about money with me.
- The boss is mad.

280
00:16:33,370 --> 00:16:35,040
I've told you many times.

281
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:38,830
Your time is way more important than money.

282
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:40,710
Let's me emphasize it again.

283
00:16:40,710 --> 00:16:43,800
Training and competing is what you should do.

284
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:47,650
Making money is what I should do.

285
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:54,730
Why standing here?

286
00:16:54,730 --> 00:16:56,420
Go training!

287
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:59,350
Yes. Let's go training.

288
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:02,580
Captain.

289
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:05,800
Why didn't you mention buying
new equipment for An Wen Yi?

290
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:08,240
It costs money.

291
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:12,970
Yes... But the boss said training
was more important than money.

292
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:14,120
Remember this.

293
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:16,520
Many things mean opposite to what people say.

294
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:19,460
The boss has spent much money on wrong things.

295
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:21,890
We shouldn't rub salt into her wound.

296
00:17:21,890 --> 00:17:23,370
Spending money on wrong things?

297
00:17:23,370 --> 00:17:27,730
But spending money on fixing computers is normal.

298
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:30,480
Maybe...

299
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,750
It was not normal maintenance.

300
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:36,222
I broke this computer.

301
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:45,890
To get more equipment?

302
00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:47,250
Yep.

303
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:50,680
To equip our new team player, An Wen Yi.

304
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:53,140
But where should we get the equipment?

305
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:57,780
Today, I'll show you what is scrap-picking.

306
00:17:57,780 --> 00:17:59,940
A great profession.

307
00:18:25,850 --> 00:18:28,780
Three guilds are attacking
Gunsmoke, the jungle boss.

308
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:30,330
What should we do?

309
00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:31,440
We stay put.

310
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,750
Watch their show quietly.

311
00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:41,250
What a mess!

312
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:43,010
The messier, the better for us to scrap-pick.

313
00:18:43,010 --> 00:18:45,290
Captain. What is scrap-picking?

314
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:47,650
It means in the flames of war,

315
00:18:47,650 --> 00:18:51,700
tough guys pillage from others aboveboard.

316
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:55,580
Is it the so-called "tough guys
pillaging from others aboveboard"?

317
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:57,040
Well.

318
00:18:57,040 --> 00:19:01,460
The first profound meaning of
scrap-picking is to win without fighting.

319
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:15,550
Go!

320
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:22,980
Run as soon as you've picked up the equipment!

321
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:32,740
To win without fighting?

322
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:33,860
Indeed!

323
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:35,200
Absolutely!

324
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,150
When did I lie?

325
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:42,490
Run faster!

326
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:46,860
Captain. They caught up with us.

327
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:49,040
It's a dead end in front. What should we do?

328
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:51,428
Then comes the second profound meaning of it.

329
00:19:52,050 --> 00:19:53,430
Remember.

330
00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:55,910
Keep a way open for retreat anytime.

331
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,950
Worm in?

332
00:20:17,630 --> 00:20:18,971
Go!

333
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:50,505
Stop looking for them.

334
00:20:50,505 --> 00:20:52,237
Fight against the boss!

335
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:16,260
Captain. The three guilds have lured the boss here.

336
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:18,180
Should we rob him?

337
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:19,780
We won't rob him this time.

338
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:23,470
Instead, we pick up equipment when it's a mess.

339
00:21:23,470 --> 00:21:26,710
But players in the three guilds are in harmony.

340
00:21:26,710 --> 00:21:28,000
Haven't seen an opportunity.

341
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,554
So now, comes the final
profound meaning of scrap-picking.

342
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:35,330
If there is no chance, we'll create one.

343
00:21:35,330 --> 00:21:36,940
Watch me shoot them.

344
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:38,900
Then they'll start a scuffle.

345
00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:41,060
Who shot us?

346
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:42,450
I knew you'd have an agenda!

347
00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:44,470
You said we'd divide the equipment equally?

348
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:45,628
Bullshit!

349
00:21:45,628 --> 00:21:47,380
Watch your mouth! Make war!

350
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:49,050
Who cares?

351
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:58,140
Bros in Lanxi Pavilion,
let's fight against Ambitions!

352
00:21:58,140 --> 00:21:59,630
They shot us unexpectedly!

353
00:21:59,630 --> 00:22:00,910
Don't let Praisage go!

354
00:22:00,910 --> 00:22:03,205
They love dirty fighting!

355
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:13,310
Captain. You're a prophet!

356
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:16,600
Now...

357
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:18,400
Comes the perfect timing.

358
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:22,940
Our first target is Cleric's top
equipment, Frigid Defender.

359
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:25,160
We need to better unite in mess situations.

360
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:27,450
Even when scrap-picking, we need to team up.

361
00:22:27,450 --> 00:22:31,271
If we use the right methods,
battle field can be our stage.

362
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:42,794
I saw Frigid Defender!

363
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:49,065
Captain.

364
00:22:49,065 --> 00:22:52,180
A guy named Deception took it away!

365
00:22:54,490 --> 00:22:57,880
I'll go after him. Yi Fan. Take care of things here.

366
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:01,570
Underling. What should we do next?

367
00:23:01,570 --> 00:23:03,830
Continue scrap-picking. Target the Cleric.

368
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:05,500
Collect everything Xiao An needs.

369
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:08,100
Wait. Look around.

370
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:10,260
Scrap-picking from us?

371
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:12,820
Walk over my dead body!

372
00:23:36,090 --> 00:23:38,382
Tang Rou has found a weak spot.

373
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,000
We need to break through quickly!

374
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,362
Xiao An, come closer to us.

375
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,800
- Xiao An. 
 - No need.

376
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:29,600
Xiao An!

377
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:34,400
Watch out!

378
00:24:52,830 --> 00:24:54,120
Bao Zi, I found Xiao An.

379
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:55,690
Come and back up. Escort him out.

380
00:24:55,690 --> 00:24:57,250
Coming!

381
00:25:04,130 --> 00:25:06,928
I told you not to come! Why are you here?

382
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:22,700
Hi, friend. You've got good skills.

383
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:24,760
But you've encountered me.

384
00:25:28,002 --> 00:25:32,600
 

385
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:17,300
Now what?

386
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:20,130
You led us to ace. Happy?

387
00:26:20,130 --> 00:26:22,340
It's fine. Yi Fan did it to save you.

388
00:26:22,350 --> 00:26:24,600
To save me?

389
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:27,430
I saw the Swordsman. Why I didn't attack him?

390
00:26:27,430 --> 00:26:29,890
I didn't want to alert the three guilds.

391
00:26:29,890 --> 00:26:31,400
He didn't have much blood.

392
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:34,110
What would happen even if he raided me? Could he kill me?

393
00:26:34,110 --> 00:26:37,260
No way! But you...

394
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:39,240
You took the plunge.

395
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:40,650
And got us all killed!

396
00:26:40,650 --> 00:26:43,880
You didn't even make right judgment of Glory!

397
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:49,000
My fault. I didn't look around.

398
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,120
Yep. Your fault.

399
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:54,260
You didn't look around. And Bao zi.

400
00:26:54,260 --> 00:26:55,760
Came too quickly to back up.

401
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:57,510
But who should we blame the most? Me?

402
00:26:57,510 --> 00:27:00,580
I shouldn't have picked the equipment. Right?

403
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:08,000
Guys. The competition is coming.

404
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,200
We didn't get the equipment we need. 
  

405
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:13,000
What's worse, we lost the only Orange equipment!

406
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:16,342
So ridiculous! Why did we do it?

407
00:27:16,342 --> 00:27:18,080
Sorry.

408
00:27:18,690 --> 00:27:20,400
With your poor judgment,

409
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:24,100
I'd suggest you should
not be a professional player.

410
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,900
Captain.

411
00:27:44,110 --> 00:27:46,240
Was I wrong?

412
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:49,620
What do you think?

413
00:27:56,800 --> 00:28:01,500
Yi Fan. I've valued your overall awareness.

414
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:04,150
But I don't want it to be...

415
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:07,537
your burden.

416
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:20,480
Yi Fan showed his weakness here.

417
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:25,090
We can see clearly he reacted more slowly here.

418
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:30,920
He used one more second when he could have reacted in subconsciousness.

419
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:34,960
The he missed the best timing... to react.

420
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:37,970
Didn't make adjustments in time after the mess.

421
00:28:37,970 --> 00:28:39,720
Also, he made mistakes.

422
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:43,220
Yes. His hit rate should have been 70%.

423
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:46,000
But now it's 30%.

424
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,760
But... It' not the most fatal.

425
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,900
The most fatal thing is...

426
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:54,400
His overall awareness was limited.

427
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:57,300
Penny wise and pound foolish. More harm than good.

428
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:05,200
Send him the report.

429
00:29:09,077 --> 00:29:10,820
 

430
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:15,700
Should we hide this magazine from him?

431
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:18,450
I'm afraid Yi Fan would be
stressed out after reading it.

432
00:29:18,450 --> 00:29:20,760
There is no burden in our Xing Xin Team.

433
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:22,160
Actually...

434
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:25,045
Yi Fan's grown the fastest among all.

435
00:29:25,045 --> 00:29:26,700
But I...

436
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:30,300
I'm afraid Yi Fan could not handle the questions.

437
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:34,080
Learning to face questions
is something he must do.

438
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:36,570
He's a professional player.

439
00:29:36,570 --> 00:29:40,340
Yi Fan's overall awareness has become his burden.

440
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:44,160
What he needs to do is
let go and believe in himself.

441
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:45,700
But no one could ever instruct him.

442
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:49,300
Whether he'd make it or not... depends on himself.

443
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:52,700
What I can do now is...

444
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:55,630
to push him hard.

445
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:11,440
But... You've got great overall awareness.

446
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:16,340
But it can't help the team kill more rivals.

447
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:18,700
It could help the team win.

448
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:20,520
What you've got is precious.

449
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:22,900
Do you think I'm qualified...

450
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:25,608
to be the vice captain?

451
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:33,894
 

452
00:30:50,930 --> 00:30:56,340
Yi Fan. I've valued your overall awareness.

453
00:30:56,340 --> 00:30:58,900
But I don't want it...

454
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:01,000
to be your burden.

455
00:31:15,010 --> 00:31:17,370
They had to scrap-pick to get equipment.

456
00:31:17,370 --> 00:31:20,800
How impoverished! How could I join them at first?

457
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:23,900
I'd better get my money and leave.

458
00:31:24,910 --> 00:31:26,290
I don't want act like them.

459
00:31:26,290 --> 00:31:29,140
They've got a stupid dream
of being professional players.

460
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:33,400
It makes them full of beans. Money is the only dream, right?

461
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:37,500
Sure! I've found another team. I'll contact them later.

462
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:40,600
I'll tell them I can...

463
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:48,200
Call you back soon.

464
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,240
Could we talk?

465
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:53,980
Just for a moment.

466
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:58,490
Sit down.

467
00:31:58,490 --> 00:32:00,000
Water?

468
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,200
Nope.

469
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,000
I want to make it clear.

470
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:06,000
The problems were serious when scrap-picking.

471
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:09,140
Bad command. Disordered team work. Let alone...

472
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:12,671
Let alone they didn't get any good equipment for you.

473
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,980
Though I don't know much about techniques,

474
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:24,940
I do know equipment is
important for a professional player.

475
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:27,662
I need to keep up your pace.

476
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:30,300
So what?

477
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:32,600
Boss, are you going to persuade me?

478
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:34,550
Even if there's no money, no equipment,

479
00:32:34,550 --> 00:32:37,434
I should be day dreaming like you are, right?

480
00:32:39,390 --> 00:32:41,140
Take this.

481
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:43,637
What do you mean?

482
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:45,700
My salary?

483
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:48,030
No.

484
00:32:48,570 --> 00:32:50,170
I'm working on your contract.

485
00:32:50,170 --> 00:32:53,410
If you have any request, talk to me. We can work things out.

486
00:32:53,410 --> 00:32:56,500
The money is for you to buy equipment.

487
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:59,700
Nothing to do with your contract or your work.

488
00:33:00,690 --> 00:33:06,800
Got it. So the money is... an extra gift you gave me.

489
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:15,900
The money is a welcome
gift the whole team gives you.

490
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:22,642
I know that as a new talent,
you may have a run-in period.

491
00:33:22,642 --> 00:33:26,320
I experienced the same when
I first opened the Net cafe.

492
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:28,500
I was stressed out every day.

493
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:32,800
Later I realized I needed to
vent the stress and frustration.

494
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:35,740
Don't let the anger go through the night.

495
00:33:35,740 --> 00:33:37,340
It's bad for your health.

496
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:38,950
So...

497
00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:42,380
How much money did you
give me to buy the equipment?

498
00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:49,470
To be honest...

499
00:33:49,470 --> 00:33:53,470
What I have got is this Net cafe.

500
00:33:53,470 --> 00:33:56,140
I don't have enough money.

501
00:33:56,140 --> 00:33:58,390
But I'm working on it.

502
00:33:58,390 --> 00:34:01,390
Right now... I can't give you the best things.

503
00:34:01,390 --> 00:34:05,610
But I can give you all I have.

504
00:34:05,610 --> 00:34:07,770
The money here...

505
00:34:07,770 --> 00:34:10,400
may just afford half of the equipment.

506
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:15,600
But I promise I'll get all
equipment other teams have.

507
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:18,300
View it as...

508
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:21,000
a promise I made as a "semi-professional boss".

509
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:25,360
Take it.

510
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:27,160
Log in Glory.

511
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:28,700
Buy it now.

512
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:31,510
- I... 
 - It's late.

513
00:34:31,510 --> 00:34:33,640
I'll go to bed now.

514
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:35,400
Boss...

515
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:37,660
Thank you for being with Xing Xin! Good night!

516
00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:39,180
I...

517
00:35:08,522 --> 00:35:10,065
 

518
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:19,945
 

519
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:27,300
Yi Cun Hui...

520
00:35:30,462 --> 00:35:33,782
 

521
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:37,640
Words of Elves...

522
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:42,400
It's top Orange equipment!

523
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:48,700
How much will it cost in the market?

524
00:35:57,402 --> 00:35:59,240
 

525
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:22,480
Thank you... for playing Gory with me.

526
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,800
- Hello, bro! 
 - Look...

527
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:45,865
Do I have a...

528
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:48,100
bad character?

529
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:50,400
You've finally figured that out!

530
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:53,200
If I didn't know you for so
long or grow up with you...

531
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:56,060
How could I put up with you?

532
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:59,600
Do you have any other friend except for me?

533
00:37:01,290 --> 00:37:02,820
Then...

534
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:05,430
What do friends mean?

535
00:37:05,430 --> 00:37:07,600
They are people whom you hurt many times

536
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:10,800
but always return good for evil.

537
00:37:12,190 --> 00:37:16,300
Hello. I am... the interviewer.

538
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:18,300
As long as you can stay, we'll work things out!

539
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:22,520
Let's wait for the captain. Then hold the meeting.

540
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:24,150
With your poor judgment,

541
00:37:24,150 --> 00:37:27,540
I'd suggest you should not be a professional player.

542
00:37:27,542 --> 00:37:29,500
Sorry.

543
00:37:34,330 --> 00:37:37,320
Could you... do me a favor?

544
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:38,840
Teach me how to debuff.

545
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:40,800
As long as I've learned it...

546
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,700
I'll gve you everything.

547
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:44,870
Yes. Now...

548
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:49,900
Xing Xin...

549
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:52,800
vs. Wei Cao...

550
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:56,565
Game to win!

551
00:38:00,731 --> 00:38:05,131
 

552
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:09,000
Captain.

553
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,000
I need to talk to you.

554
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,120
Captain!

555
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:18,810
- Yi Fan is gone. 
 - What?

556
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:21,320
Captain. Didn't find him on the 2nd floor.

557
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:22,860
He's not on the roof, either.

558
00:38:22,860 --> 00:38:25,360
He didn't answer my call. Where did Yi Fan go?

559
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:27,560
I didn't see him last night.

560
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:29,500
Did he leave because he was stressed out?

561
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:31,100
No.

562
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,300
Yi Fan will not desert from the battlefield.

563
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:39,100
It's 8:30. The competition starts at 9:00.

564
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:42,290
You go first. Don't be late. I'll go look for him.

565
00:38:42,290 --> 00:38:44,130
What should we do with one absent?

566
00:38:44,130 --> 00:38:46,810
Without Yi Fan, the rest of us...

567
00:38:46,810 --> 00:38:49,351
will share his duty.

568
00:39:04,057 --> 00:39:06,580
 

569
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
Yi Fan sent an email.

570
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:34,600
Killing Every Ten Steps made a strategic error. Wei Cao actively attacked.

571
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:37,000
With the debuff effect, they aced soon.

572
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,800
No one passed when against Yuxuan Pavilion. Time was out.

573
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:41,762
One passed when against Miracle.

574
00:39:41,762 --> 00:39:44,140
Took 13 minutes and 51 seconds.

575
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:47,780
These were teams against Wei Cao.

576
00:39:48,470 --> 00:39:50,600
- Yi Fan arrived at the scene earlier. 
 - Yes.

577
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:52,300
And he prepared a lot.

578
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:53,990
I'll go find him.

579
00:39:53,990 --> 00:39:56,200
- I'll go, too. 
 - No need.

580
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,900
If he doesn't want to compete...

581
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:02,800
it would not work... when we forced him.

582
00:40:05,922 --> 00:40:09,880
 

583
00:40:13,568 --> 00:40:15,725
 

584
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:24,400
Where are you going?

585
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:27,253
The competition will start soon.

586
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,681
Who are you?

587
00:40:33,230 --> 00:40:35,980
Remember the scrap-picking?

588
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:39,780
You robbed Praisage of too much equipment.

589
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:42,500
At first, I thought you were an expert.

590
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:47,800
But, after some research,
I found out that you are a newbie.
