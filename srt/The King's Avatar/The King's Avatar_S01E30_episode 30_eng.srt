25
00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:51,105
The last hit.

26
00:01:51,105 --> 00:01:53,545
Ye Qiu's continuous attacking
has eliminated Flames.

27
00:01:53,545 --> 00:01:55,961
The winner is Ye Qiu.

28
00:01:55,961 --> 00:01:57,824
This is a historical moment.

29
00:01:57,824 --> 00:02:00,298
Master Ye has returned to Glory as a Freelancer.

30
00:02:00,298 --> 00:02:03,865
Both the Umbrella and Freelancer
have opened a new era of Glory.

31
00:02:03,865 --> 00:02:07,569
This is the real Master Ye and the King's Avatar.

32
00:02:07,569 --> 00:02:11,437
Congratulations. Ye and Xing Xin has scored one.

33
00:02:21,263 --> 00:02:26,097
On September 5, Guang...

34
00:02:26,097 --> 00:02:28,039
won the game.

35
00:02:30,876 --> 00:02:35,338
After the Individual Game, Xing Xin only lags behind Miracle by 1:2 now.

36
00:02:35,338 --> 00:02:39,728
Come on. we've won. Why are you sitting here?

37
00:02:39,728 --> 00:02:42,450
Although there is only you and me,

38
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:44,640
we can cover the people of all ages.

39
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:48,378
Come on. Let's cheer and let the Master hear it.

40
00:02:49,171 --> 00:02:52,154
Don't think you're too old to be passionate?

41
00:02:52,154 --> 00:02:56,010
Glory is your time machine that
will send you back to the past.

42
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:58,256
Just a game. Don't be so excited.

43
00:02:58,256 --> 00:03:02,629
But it's the game that can bridge our age gap,

44
00:03:02,629 --> 00:03:05,279
awaken our heroic dream in the boring life,

45
00:03:05,279 --> 00:03:08,739
and let a boy as him become a public idol.

46
00:03:08,739 --> 00:03:11,830
- A public idol?
- Yes.

47
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:15,780
He has been telling us
that there is nothing impossible in life.

48
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:20,342
Even if you were expelled, retired, challenged,

49
00:03:20,342 --> 00:03:22,703
or you lost Leaf of Autumn.

50
00:03:22,703 --> 00:03:26,144
He's still standing on the stage.

51
00:03:27,747 --> 00:03:29,321
Are you ready?

52
00:03:29,321 --> 00:03:31,654
I'll bring you something.

53
00:03:33,478 --> 00:03:34,828
Here you are.

54
00:03:34,828 --> 00:03:36,985
 

55
00:03:36,985 --> 00:03:42,374
Master. Master...

56
00:03:42,374 --> 00:03:45,151
Captain, you're so amazing in the game.

57
00:03:45,151 --> 00:03:47,825
That guy was no match for you at all.

58
00:03:47,825 --> 00:03:52,413
- Did the atmosphere of game make you play better? 
 -

59
00:03:52,413 --> 00:03:56,680
Or did you want to strengthen our weak fan base.

60
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,330
No.

61
00:04:00,704 --> 00:04:03,783
Don't look at me. Ask him.

62
00:04:05,275 --> 00:04:10,979
Captain, we just want to know why you
took off your mask suddenly.

63
00:04:13,771 --> 00:04:17,210
Do you know how hot inside the room?

64
00:04:17,210 --> 00:04:22,106
Ladies and gentlemen, it's
time for the Arena Contest.

65
00:04:22,106 --> 00:04:28,074
The first game is Miracle's Li
Xiang vs Xing Xin's Wei Chen.

66
00:04:28,074 --> 00:04:31,780
Let me introduce the players from both teams.

67
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:35,081
Mr. Wei Chen, please.

68
00:04:35,081 --> 00:04:37,382
The continuous attacking was awesome indeed,

69
00:04:37,382 --> 00:04:39,683
but you can't win all the honors along.

70
00:04:39,683 --> 00:04:45,636
In the Arena Contest, I'm sure I'll defeat two opponents, maybe three.

71
00:04:45,636 --> 00:04:48,265
I believe you can break the record.

72
00:04:48,265 --> 00:04:51,236
What record do you mean,

73
00:04:51,236 --> 00:04:54,688
the shortest winning time or the highest damage?

74
00:04:54,688 --> 00:04:57,172
The oldest comeback player.

75
00:04:57,172 --> 00:04:58,529
Put on your mask.

76
00:04:58,529 --> 00:05:00,792
- Now, we'll...
- Defeat them!

77
00:05:00,792 --> 00:05:03,925
Mr. Li Xiang from Miracle.

78
00:05:07,067 --> 00:05:09,701
Wei Chen is an experienced player. Be careful.

79
00:05:09,701 --> 00:05:11,740
Never talk to him.

80
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:13,363
Just fight silently.

81
00:05:13,363 --> 00:05:15,577
You're no match for him at swearing.

82
00:05:15,577 --> 00:05:18,428
Defeat him with a hand-to-hand fight, got it?

83
00:05:18,428 --> 00:05:20,117
Got it.

84
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:24,896
We're both warlocks. How
could I hand-to-hand fight him?

85
00:05:24,896 --> 00:05:26,920
The first Contest between Xing Xin and Miracle:

86
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:30,031
Windward Formation of Xing
Xin vs Memory in Eyes of Miracle.

87
00:05:30,031 --> 00:05:32,506
A fight between warlocks is about to begin.

88
00:05:32,506 --> 00:05:34,612
The game begins. In the fight between warlocks,

89
00:05:34,612 --> 00:05:37,767
predicting and controlling the
distance are the key elements.

90
00:05:37,767 --> 00:05:40,770
As the class of Long-range
attack and various control abilities,

91
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:44,170
the one who hit the other first
will have a greater advantage.

92
00:05:47,969 --> 00:05:49,016
What the hell is it?

93
00:05:49,016 --> 00:05:51,217
Is he really the founder of Containment?

94
00:05:51,217 --> 00:05:53,380
Why is he standing at the center of Arena?

95
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:56,488
Kid, are you coming?

96
00:05:56,488 --> 00:06:01,437
Why are young guys now
so lazy and moving so slowly?

97
00:06:01,437 --> 00:06:05,034
If you are not coming, I'll come to you.

98
00:06:05,034 --> 00:06:08,308
As the earliest Master of
Glory and player of Swoksaar

99
00:06:08,308 --> 00:06:11,839
Wei's understanding on warlocks
must have been very profound.

100
00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:14,449
Now Windward is moving to Memory.

101
00:06:14,449 --> 00:06:16,247
He's coming to Memory's attack range.

102
00:06:16,247 --> 00:06:17,917
Suddenly, he stops.

103
00:06:17,917 --> 00:06:19,512
The veteran is indeed experienced,

104
00:06:19,512 --> 00:06:23,229
He knows accurately the
casting range of his opponent.

105
00:06:24,107 --> 00:06:27,828
Windward starts backing to
distance himself from his opponent.

106
00:06:27,828 --> 00:06:30,245
It makes Miracle's warlock a little confused.

107
00:06:30,245 --> 00:06:33,120
What the hell is it now?

108
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:36,302
Memory in Eyes is moving forward.

109
00:06:36,302 --> 00:06:38,403
Here you are.

110
00:06:44,618 --> 00:06:47,290
Impossible. Warlocks' attack ranges are all same.

111
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:48,857
- You're not inside my range.
- Memory is hit.

112
00:06:48,857 --> 00:06:51,293
How could you hit me?

113
00:06:51,293 --> 00:06:53,642
Kids these days are so simple.

114
00:06:53,642 --> 00:06:57,070
If I have no trump card, how
can I fight you hand to hand?

115
00:06:57,070 --> 00:07:01,390
Yes, I'm not inside your
range, but you're inside mine.

116
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:09,401
Magic bomb. Memory is down
without any chance to fight back.

117
00:07:09,401 --> 00:07:12,144
Okay, let's see the Data Analysis of the game.

118
00:07:12,144 --> 00:07:15,842
I think the range of the weapon, Wand of Death,

119
00:07:15,842 --> 00:07:19,111
was increased during its forging process.

120
00:07:19,111 --> 00:07:20,302
From the picture,

121
00:07:20,302 --> 00:07:25,825
We can see Windward's range
is two grids farther than Memory's.

122
00:07:25,825 --> 00:07:31,721
How could I be the founder of
Containment without a best weapon?

123
00:07:31,721 --> 00:07:35,582
I'm not retired yet.

124
00:07:40,208 --> 00:07:43,417
Windward's Gate of Death. He would be erased if he's hit by it.

125
00:07:43,417 --> 00:07:48,210
Memory's hit. He is being dragged
slowly into the Gate of Death.

126
00:07:49,284 --> 00:07:52,585
Gate of Death has exploded and he's been erased.

127
00:07:52,585 --> 00:07:55,390
Congratulations to Windward
Formation on his win...

128
00:07:55,390 --> 00:07:56,323
Well done.

129
00:07:56,323 --> 00:07:58,577
He scored one for Xing Xin and lost only 30% HP.

130
00:07:58,577 --> 00:08:02,688
Now the Arena defender is Wei Chen,

131
00:08:02,688 --> 00:08:06,878
who will be challenged by Deng Yinan of Miracle.

132
00:08:06,878 --> 00:08:08,901
Everyone, Mr. Deng Yinan.

133
00:08:08,901 --> 00:08:10,861
The second Arena Game: Deng Yinan vs Wei Chen...

134
00:08:10,861 --> 00:08:14,932
Kid, Miracle's performance is terrible.

135
00:08:14,932 --> 00:08:17,542
If everyone in Miracle is like the boy I erased,

136
00:08:17,542 --> 00:08:21,129
then don't waste my time and get out of here.

137
00:08:21,129 --> 00:08:22,716
Let's start to fight, sir.

138
00:08:22,716 --> 00:08:25,922
Both characters have entered
the Arena. The game begins.

139
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:27,446
Though being good at hand-to-hand fight,

140
00:08:27,446 --> 00:08:30,104
a Swordsman's speeds of
attacking and moving is outstanding.

141
00:08:30,104 --> 00:08:33,699
So, to fight a long-range attacking warlock, he may not be in a bad position.

142
00:08:33,699 --> 00:08:35,880
Besides, he can do much
damage with a heavy strike.

143
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:38,708
If the opportunity is right,
it's very likely to erase...

144
00:08:38,708 --> 00:08:40,855
Kid, I give you three minutes.

145
00:08:40,855 --> 00:08:44,680
If you can find me within
the time, I'll fight against you.

146
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:47,370
Sir, aren't you standing at
the center of Arena this time?

147
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:51,552
It's ridiculous. I'm the founder of Containment.

148
00:08:51,552 --> 00:08:53,806
I said I would hide myself this time.

149
00:08:53,806 --> 00:08:57,670
Keeping promise is my motto.

150
00:08:57,670 --> 00:09:00,463
It looks like he's waiting for
Windy Nightside to move forward,

151
00:09:00,463 --> 00:09:03,166
then give him a surprise attack.

152
00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:09,523
However, Nightside seems to
see through Windward's intention.

153
00:09:09,523 --> 00:09:11,618
Instead of moving to his adversary's hiding area.

154
00:09:11,618 --> 00:09:14,030
He's sneaking to his back.

155
00:09:17,134 --> 00:09:18,102
He's close to him.

156
00:09:18,102 --> 00:09:21,980
Nightside is watching the terrain
to judge Windward's position.

157
00:09:35,692 --> 00:09:39,916
Why don't you come yet?
Want to give me a sneak attack?

158
00:09:39,916 --> 00:09:43,200
You'll never have a chance to do that.

159
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,173
Fire!

160
00:09:44,173 --> 00:09:47,533
Windward is shooting magic
missile, then Arrow of Curse.

161
00:09:47,533 --> 00:09:50,809
But the Swordsman has dodged
them and is approaching him.

162
00:09:53,018 --> 00:09:54,946
Damn it, he's approaching.

163
00:09:54,946 --> 00:09:57,063
Poor Wei.

164
00:10:01,556 --> 00:10:03,483
Windward has been chopped down.

165
00:10:03,483 --> 00:10:05,775
Windy Nightside's attack is very lethal,

166
00:10:05,775 --> 00:10:09,306
With his remaining little HP,
the warlock is killed immediately.

167
00:10:09,306 --> 00:10:13,107
With his 70% HP, Windward has
reduced Nightside's HP to 50%.

168
00:10:13,107 --> 00:10:16,199
Even so, Xing Xin has still one
more challengers than its rival.

169
00:10:16,199 --> 00:10:20,049
Miracle has scored one.
The scores are now tied at 1:1.

170
00:10:20,049 --> 00:10:22,522
- Though... 
 - You said you'd defeat two opponents.

171
00:10:22,522 --> 00:10:24,484
You said you were sure to win.

172
00:10:24,484 --> 00:10:28,425
And you said keeping promise was your motto.

173
00:10:30,961 --> 00:10:32,813
You don't get it.

174
00:10:32,813 --> 00:10:35,822
I've just given Luo Ji a chance to show himself.

175
00:10:37,896 --> 00:10:40,104
- Now... 
 - The opponent has only half HP.

176
00:10:40,104 --> 00:10:42,722
Decrease his HP and defeat him.

177
00:10:42,722 --> 00:10:45,098
Luo Ji of Xing Xin is gonna challenge him.

178
00:10:45,098 --> 00:10:47,201
Everybody, Mr. Luo Ji.

179
00:10:47,201 --> 00:10:48,550
In the third game,

180
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:52,180
Summoner Mei Guang will
fight Swordsman Windy Nightside.

181
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:54,513
Luo Ji, the second player of Xing Xin,

182
00:10:54,513 --> 00:10:56,925
has never emerged in the games of Glory.

183
00:10:56,925 --> 00:10:59,588
So we haven't any records about him.

184
00:10:59,588 --> 00:11:01,932
Will he become an outstanding newcomer?

185
00:11:01,932 --> 00:11:03,348
Let's wait and see.

186
00:11:03,348 --> 00:11:08,105
Though he defeated Windward,
Nightside has only 50% HP left.

187
00:11:08,105 --> 00:11:12,215
With full HP, Mei Guang
has a bigger chance to win.

188
00:11:12,215 --> 00:11:15,127
After practicing with me for a long time?

189
00:11:15,127 --> 00:11:16,528
Has Luo made any progress?

190
00:11:16,528 --> 00:11:18,999
Take it easy. That guy has only half HP.

191
00:11:18,999 --> 00:11:22,046
He's sure to beat him.

192
00:11:22,046 --> 00:11:25,341
The game begins. Ice Wolf. Mei Guang is summoning Four Beasts.

193
00:11:25,341 --> 00:11:27,517
But Nightside is close to him now,

194
00:11:27,517 --> 00:11:30,664
so maybe the summoning will be interrupted.

195
00:11:32,505 --> 00:11:35,993
As expected, dodging the
Wolf, Nightside is rushing to Luo.

196
00:11:35,993 --> 00:11:39,042
It's dangerous if a Summoner
is approached by a Swordsman.

197
00:11:41,134 --> 00:11:43,204
Too close.

198
00:11:44,603 --> 00:11:47,672
Nightside has chopped down his
opponent without losing any HP.

199
00:11:47,672 --> 00:11:51,127
So the defender is still
Mr. Deng Yinan of Miracle.

200
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:54,076
The challenger from Xing Xin is Miss Tang Rou.

201
00:11:54,076 --> 00:11:56,083
Everybody, Miss Tang Rou.

202
00:11:56,083 --> 00:11:57,472
The fourth game:

203
00:11:57,472 --> 00:12:00,488
Han Yan Rou, a Battlemage,
vs Windy Nightside, a Swordman.

204
00:12:00,488 --> 00:12:04,194
Nightside has already defeated two adversaries...

205
00:12:04,194 --> 00:12:06,241
Are you here to let me chop you off?

206
00:12:06,241 --> 00:12:08,971
- I'm afraid you can't chop again.
- Let me try it.

207
00:12:08,971 --> 00:12:11,209
As the last player of Xing Xin,

208
00:12:11,209 --> 00:12:14,502
Tang has to defeat two
adversaries to win the Arena Contest.

209
00:12:14,502 --> 00:12:18,108
Tang is launching a fierce
attack. Nightside is fighting back.

210
00:12:18,108 --> 00:12:19,693
Keeping launching attack for a while,

211
00:12:19,693 --> 00:12:22,223
Nightside's HP has been reduced to 30%.

212
00:12:22,223 --> 00:12:24,888
But Tang's own HP is decreasing quickly.

213
00:12:41,484 --> 00:12:42,707
Flying Sword.

214
00:12:42,707 --> 00:12:45,338
Without dodging, Tang is
shooting back with icy Chaser.

215
00:12:45,338 --> 00:12:48,658
When Nightside becomes stiff,
Tang erases him immediately.

216
00:12:48,658 --> 00:12:50,523
Tang Rou has won. Congratulations.

217
00:12:50,523 --> 00:12:53,292
She's scored one for Xing Xin.

218
00:12:53,292 --> 00:12:57,701
Though she has won, her HP is very low.

219
00:12:57,701 --> 00:12:59,502
It's difficult for her.

220
00:12:59,502 --> 00:13:01,509
This is Tang Rou's style.

221
00:13:01,509 --> 00:13:05,635
Without bravery, she might not know how to fight.

222
00:13:05,635 --> 00:13:08,349
If she can fight like this,

223
00:13:08,349 --> 00:13:10,145
it's likely she'll win.

224
00:13:10,952 --> 00:13:13,499
- Thank you for your sacrifice.
- Don't mock me.

225
00:13:13,499 --> 00:13:15,411
Look at your HP.

226
00:13:15,411 --> 00:13:18,379
You haven't won yet. We've
got one more challenger.

227
00:13:18,379 --> 00:13:21,563
You can't beat my vice-captain with such low HP.

228
00:13:21,563 --> 00:13:23,626
Tang, take it easy.

229
00:13:23,626 --> 00:13:27,003
Just fight without worry.

230
00:13:27,003 --> 00:13:29,772
Sure, I can beat one and half.

231
00:13:29,772 --> 00:13:32,764
I'll erase the first one with the least HP,

232
00:13:32,764 --> 00:13:35,697
then deal with the second at full stretch.

233
00:13:40,968 --> 00:13:43,312
Now the defender is Xing Xin,
 

234
00:13:43,312 --> 00:13:47,313
and the challenger from Miracle is Wang Xing.
 

235
00:13:47,313 --> 00:13:49,141
Mr. Wang Xing.

236
00:13:49,141 --> 00:13:50,974
Come on, buddy.

237
00:13:50,974 --> 00:13:52,490
The last contest:

238
00:13:52,490 --> 00:13:55,010
Han Yan Rou, a Battlemage, vs Street Fighter.

239
00:13:55,010 --> 00:13:56,560
The game begins.

240
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:59,898
Though she won the previous
game, Tang lost many HP.

241
00:13:59,898 --> 00:14:01,909
The game will be very difficult for her.

242
00:14:01,909 --> 00:14:04,155
Now Street Fighter is looking for Tang's location.

243
00:14:04,155 --> 00:14:06,377
Hiding at the high point and
watching Fighter's movement,

244
00:14:06,377 --> 00:14:08,721
Tang doesn't hurry to attack.

245
00:14:18,381 --> 00:14:20,047
Tang is attacking with Dragon's Pressure

246
00:14:20,047 --> 00:14:23,964
Fighter dodges it and
tosses Gas Bottle. It hits Tang.

247
00:14:24,674 --> 00:14:27,629
Fighter is approaching and
attacking Tang who is defending.

248
00:14:27,629 --> 00:14:29,932
Miss Tang is not strong as in the previous game.

249
00:14:29,932 --> 00:14:31,406
She chooses to defend.

250
00:14:31,406 --> 00:14:35,959
But, with lower HP, she wouldn't
win the game only with defense.

251
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:49,264
What's the matter with Tang?

252
00:14:49,264 --> 00:14:53,608
With lower HP, Tang
chooses to fight conservatively.

253
00:14:54,689 --> 00:14:56,935
Is it a wise decision?

254
00:14:58,022 --> 00:14:59,866
In this way,

255
00:14:59,866 --> 00:15:01,524
she'll lose.

256
00:15:01,524 --> 00:15:02,897
Why?

257
00:15:02,897 --> 00:15:05,595
She would lose faster if she chooses to attack.

258
00:15:05,595 --> 00:15:09,234
She's avoiding the fight. Is
this the Tang you have known?

259
00:15:09,234 --> 00:15:10,523
She's hit by Sand Ball again.

260
00:15:10,523 --> 00:15:13,237
Tang is blind. It's dangerous now.

261
00:15:14,569 --> 00:15:16,672
Fighter is approaching and punching.

262
00:15:16,672 --> 00:15:18,599
Tang can't dodge and her HP becomes zero.

263
00:15:18,599 --> 00:15:21,987
Street Fighter has won the game. Congratulations.

264
00:15:23,011 --> 00:15:25,058
Either attacking recklessly,

265
00:15:25,058 --> 00:15:27,307
or dodging inexperiencedly,

266
00:15:27,307 --> 00:15:29,922
so your price is to be completely crushed.

267
00:15:29,922 --> 00:15:32,350
Keep practicing.

268
00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:35,012
Miss Tang hasn't defeated two adversaries,

269
00:15:35,012 --> 00:15:37,678
so Miracle has won the Arena
Game and scored three points.

270
00:15:37,678 --> 00:15:39,353
Miracle is now ahead with the score of 5:1

271
00:15:39,353 --> 00:15:41,098
Xing Xin is in trouble.

272
00:15:41,098 --> 00:15:43,944
They have to do excellently in the Team Game,

273
00:15:43,944 --> 00:15:46,364
if they want to turn the tide.

274
00:15:46,364 --> 00:15:51,341
Alright, Let's give it up for the winner,
Mr. Wang Xing from Miracle.

275
00:15:51,341 --> 00:15:53,779
After Miss Tang lost the game,

276
00:15:53,779 --> 00:15:56,966
Xing Xin has lagged behind
Miracle by a big gap of 1:5.

277
00:15:56,966 --> 00:15:59,807
Xing Xin has to come up with
solutions during the interval,

278
00:15:59,807 --> 00:16:03,213
because they are now in
a very dangerous situation.

279
00:16:20,984 --> 00:16:22,720
What did you think about it?

280
00:16:24,746 --> 00:16:26,530
I haven't drunk it yet.

281
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:31,167
I mean the game.

282
00:16:32,023 --> 00:16:33,992
It's your first competition.

283
00:16:36,253 --> 00:16:38,364
I'll win it back.

284
00:16:38,364 --> 00:16:39,986
How?

285
00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:46,899
Another question.

286
00:16:47,862 --> 00:16:50,077
Why did you lose the game?

287
00:16:51,546 --> 00:16:53,966
My weakness is too obvious

288
00:16:53,966 --> 00:16:55,737
What is it?

289
00:16:56,764 --> 00:16:59,648
I lost too many HP in my first game,

290
00:16:59,648 --> 00:17:02,600
so I've got no advantage in the second.

291
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:04,449
Besides, I'm inexperienced.

292
00:17:04,449 --> 00:17:07,369
I can't counter-attack in defense.

293
00:17:07,369 --> 00:17:10,130
So my weakness is...

294
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:12,122
I'm not powerful enough.

295
00:17:12,122 --> 00:17:14,012
You're not.

296
00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:17,795
But that's not the reason.

297
00:17:17,795 --> 00:17:22,564
You lost to him... because you changed your fighting tactic.

298
00:17:22,564 --> 00:17:25,547
But my HP was lower.

299
00:17:25,547 --> 00:17:26,726
If I didn't change my tactic...

300
00:17:26,726 --> 00:17:30,173
No tactic is perfect.

301
00:17:30,173 --> 00:17:34,930
The key to winning... is not what tactic you choose,

302
00:17:34,930 --> 00:17:37,779
but to find one that suits you.

303
00:17:41,355 --> 00:17:44,832
Having too many choices is
not as good as having no choice.

304
00:17:47,032 --> 00:17:48,949
Anytime,

305
00:17:48,949 --> 00:17:51,307
You shouldn't easily doubt yourself.

306
00:18:20,531 --> 00:18:24,475
I think sometimes we need to doubt ourselves...

307
00:18:24,475 --> 00:18:27,644
at least on such trifles.

308
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:42,464
I think Ye Qiu is messing up this time.

309
00:18:42,464 --> 00:18:45,829
It has turned out the mockery
they were subjected to is accurate.

310
00:18:45,829 --> 00:18:49,313
They are very weak and vulnerable.

311
00:18:49,313 --> 00:18:53,067
Captain, you're the only one who lost to them badly.

312
00:18:53,067 --> 00:18:54,479
Nonsense.

313
00:18:54,479 --> 00:18:59,156
I was just proving with my failure...that we can't underestimate Xing Xin too much

314
00:18:59,156 --> 00:19:01,416
even if it's a weak team. Got it?

315
00:19:01,416 --> 00:19:04,535
The Team Game will be more difficult for us.

316
00:19:04,535 --> 00:19:07,071
Miracle is good at the tactic
"One Defended by Four".

317
00:19:07,071 --> 00:19:11,285
Its achievements over the years
depend on its perfect defense.

318
00:19:11,285 --> 00:19:14,078
Sir, What is the "One Defended by Four"?

319
00:19:14,078 --> 00:19:17,657
All players are fighting to
protect their core member.

320
00:19:17,657 --> 00:19:19,871
Then what shall we do?

321
00:19:19,871 --> 00:19:22,894
Kill their captain at all costs.

322
00:19:22,894 --> 00:19:27,560
I agree with it. But it would be hard to do without a Cleric.

323
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:29,384
We must fight steadily in Team Game.

324
00:19:29,384 --> 00:19:31,212
No Cleric.

325
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:33,600
What...

326
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:37,528
Ye, this is not the fight in Dungeon.

327
00:19:37,528 --> 00:19:40,004
Our endurance will be affected without a Cleric.

328
00:19:40,004 --> 00:19:44,840
They're all experienced players. It's difficult to beat them.

329
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:48,164
I'm not propagating for the opponent, but in terms of team strength,

330
00:19:48,164 --> 00:19:49,921
we still lag far behind Miracle.

331
00:19:49,921 --> 00:19:53,151
A protracted fight would make
our disadvantage more obvious.

332
00:19:53,151 --> 00:19:56,698
Their perfect defensive
system is at the Alliance level.

333
00:19:56,698 --> 00:19:59,248
A common tactic can't break it.

334
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:04,113
We have to use an all-or-nothing tactic.

335
00:20:04,113 --> 00:20:08,263
I count on Mo Fan's surprise
attack to tear a breach for us.

336
00:20:08,263 --> 00:20:12,318
Okay. Let's take the risk under your leadership.

337
00:20:13,850 --> 00:20:15,750
Now it's your turn.

338
00:20:19,630 --> 00:20:23,668
Because of Ye Qiu, the game Xing Xin vs Miracle
has attracted much interest.

339
00:20:23,668 --> 00:20:26,533
Ye's first appearance has
also aroused heated comments.

340
00:20:26,533 --> 00:20:29,390
But in the Individual Game,
Xing Xin lagged much behind.

341
00:20:29,390 --> 00:20:33,210
So it would be very hard
to fight in the Team Game.

342
00:20:33,802 --> 00:20:36,496
Now, the Team Game is kicking off.

343
00:20:36,496 --> 00:20:40,878
The players of both teams
are going to the game room.

344
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,218
Where's Mo Fan?

345
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:52,562
He's very obedient.

346
00:20:53,610 --> 00:20:54,955
Damn it.

347
00:20:54,955 --> 00:20:58,812
Let's see the lineups of both sides. Miracle's lineup is same as usual.

348
00:20:58,812 --> 00:21:03,441
But there's no Cleric in Xing Xin. This is really a desperate lineup.

349
00:21:03,441 --> 00:21:06,318
And all the ten players in the
room are all output-oriented,

350
00:21:06,318 --> 00:21:09,361
except Xing Xin's substitute is
Warlock Windward Formation,

351
00:21:09,361 --> 00:21:12,365
and Miracle's substitute is Cleric Sincerity.

352
00:21:12,365 --> 00:21:15,312
Now the characters of both
sides are entering the map.

353
00:21:15,312 --> 00:21:18,531
The Team Game between
Xing Xin and Miracle is beginning.

354
00:21:18,531 --> 00:21:22,456
In the Individual and Arena games, Miracle was more excellent.

355
00:21:22,456 --> 00:21:25,605
But in the Team Game, because both teams have no Cleric on the field,

356
00:21:25,605 --> 00:21:29,021
the team that cooperates better
will take control of the game.

357
00:21:29,021 --> 00:21:30,703
Back off. Don't let them get close.

358
00:21:30,703 --> 00:21:34,063
The longer the fight lasts, the better for us.

359
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:38,094
Both sides are exchanging fire fiercely
at the beginning.

360
00:21:38,094 --> 00:21:41,908
Xing Xin is obviously at a
disadvantage in attacking range.

361
00:21:41,908 --> 00:21:45,840
Because Xing Xin has no
Cleric, they can't fight like this.

362
00:21:46,494 --> 00:21:48,997
Miracle plays well at the beginning...

363
00:21:48,997 --> 00:21:50,723
What is that?

364
00:21:50,723 --> 00:21:53,043
This is teamwork. It's very good.

365
00:21:53,043 --> 00:21:55,889
The situation will be good
for Miracle, if Xing Xin can't...

366
00:21:55,889 --> 00:21:59,740
Good. Control our HP. It's very easy to beat them.

367
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:02,229
Yes, if the front attack fails...

368
00:22:02,229 --> 00:22:04,070
They're dispersing.

369
00:22:04,070 --> 00:22:05,387
Then, it's your funeral.

370
00:22:05,387 --> 00:22:09,474
They've got hooked. Find your target. Destroy them one by one.

371
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:13,668
Qiao Yi Fan is targeting at the Knight Is this Xing Xin's man-to-man tactics?

372
00:22:13,668 --> 00:22:16,083
Now it seems to be an individual game.

373
00:22:16,083 --> 00:22:18,689
Tang Rou is targeting at the Ranger.

374
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:23,966
I'm looking for their Elemental Mage.

375
00:22:23,966 --> 00:22:25,651
- Got him.
- Damn it.

376
00:22:25,651 --> 00:22:27,892
Xing Xin's fighting formation
is widely stretched now.

377
00:22:27,892 --> 00:22:30,436
Do they want to beat Miracle
by individual strength?

378
00:22:30,436 --> 00:22:32,480
But according to the previous games,

379
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,812
it's hard for them to gain an advantage
in one-on-one fight,

380
00:22:34,812 --> 00:22:38,435
especially Bao Zi', his movement is clumsy.

381
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:49,580
Qiao is at a disadvantage now.

382
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:52,889
The HPs of both sides are nearly same. It's not good for Xing Xin.

383
00:22:52,889 --> 00:22:54,870
Dragging on like this,
once Miracle's Cleric comes on,

384
00:22:54,870 --> 00:22:58,200
it's unlikely for Xing Xin to turn the tables.

385
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:20,449
Tang's counterattack was very impressive.

386
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:27,900
Bao Zi seems to have not found a way
to beat the mage yet.

387
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:30,228
He's very tired.

388
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:34,120
Jun Mo Xiao is fighting
Miracle's Warlock and Sharpshooter.

389
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:37,510
Though it's two-to-one,
Miracle is not at an advantage.

390
00:23:37,510 --> 00:23:38,861
The Master is indeed outstanding.

391
00:23:38,861 --> 00:23:42,320
He's reducing effortlessly
his two adversaries' HP.

392
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:47,460
Making a comeback,
you should have joined Miracle directly.

393
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:51,400
Really? But I want Xing Xin to win.

394
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:53,362
All your teammates are useless.

395
00:23:53,362 --> 00:23:56,906
In Xing Xin, I think only you deserve
to fight against me.

396
00:23:56,906 --> 00:24:00,920
Thank you. But you don't deserve it.

397
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:11,160
 

398
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:13,860
Look! See?
 

399
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:17,348
Wait, who has seen their Ninja?

400
00:24:17,348 --> 00:24:19,043
No.

401
00:24:19,043 --> 00:24:20,585
Damn it!

402
00:24:20,585 --> 00:24:22,334
Now!

403
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:47,007
Xing Xin has first killed an adversary,
so Miracle's substitute is coming on.

404
00:24:48,850 --> 00:24:52,936
Fighting individually, the other three Xing Xin players
are moving closer.

405
00:24:52,936 --> 00:24:58,300
Qiao, Tang and Bao Zi protect each other. This is teamwork.

406
00:25:09,890 --> 00:25:10,690
Good job. - Qiao has successfully erased the Mage.
- Awesome.

407
00:25:10,690 --> 00:25:13,840
- Qiao has successfully erased the Mage.
- Awesome.

408
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:16,051
Look at Master's fight.

409
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:31,520
Fighting in rotation,
Xing Xin players keep attacking.

410
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:34,477
Miracle players is completely overwhelmed.

411
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:50,146
Dragon's Pressure.
Miracle's Knight has also been erased.

412
00:26:04,770 --> 00:26:06,145
This is a wonderful team game.

413
00:26:06,145 --> 00:26:09,157
- Xing Xin is telling us what teamwork is.
- Awesome.

414
00:26:09,157 --> 00:26:10,312
Awesome.

415
00:26:10,312 --> 00:26:13,394
The ultimate winner is Xing Xin
which has done marvels.

416
00:26:13,394 --> 00:26:15,580
Scoring only one point
in Individual and Arena games,

417
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:17,707
and in Miracle's home field,
they're underestimated...

418
00:26:17,707 --> 00:26:21,286
- Very good.
- I said you're awesome.

419
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:34,090
Xing Xin has won the first
Challenge by 6:5. Congratulations.

420
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:39,167
Come on, cheer!

421
00:26:39,167 --> 00:26:42,683
Master, I love you.

422
00:26:42,683 --> 00:26:45,748
Your performance today is very close to mine.

423
00:26:45,748 --> 00:26:47,732
You're awesome.

424
00:26:47,732 --> 00:26:50,108
A Ninjas doesn't need a hug,

425
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:53,018
except today.

426
00:26:53,018 --> 00:26:57,333
Don't put on airs and make me embarrassed again.

427
00:26:57,333 --> 00:27:00,468
Brat, never put on airs again.

428
00:27:00,468 --> 00:27:02,447
Where's Captain Ye?

429
00:27:07,670 --> 00:27:09,271
Master.

430
00:27:09,271 --> 00:27:14,532
Master, you're so wonderful and too awesome today.

431
00:27:14,532 --> 00:27:16,349
- Listen...
- Do you know, Master?

432
00:27:16,349 --> 00:27:18,850
You also gave me an unprecedented power,

433
00:27:18,850 --> 00:27:22,620
with which I beat their huge
cheering team by myself.

434
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:27,740
No, by myself and him. I've got an old fan today.

435
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:33,901
Though he is too old to jump and cheer,
he adores you very much.

436
00:27:33,901 --> 00:27:35,159
Where's he?

437
00:27:35,159 --> 00:27:36,990
He's gone away.

438
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:42,660
 

439
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:13,823

Come home anytime if you want.

447
00:28:59,876 --> 00:29:01,103

452
00:29:23,870 --> 00:29:26,513
In the just-concluded first Challenge of Glory,

453
00:29:26,513 --> 00:29:29,362
Xing Xin has turned the tables to beat Miracle...
 

454
00:29:29,362 --> 00:29:30,866
and won their first victory.
 

455
00:29:30,866 --> 00:29:32,981
However, the fans are paying
more attention to Ye Qiu,

456
00:29:32,981 --> 00:29:35,586
known as the Master of Glory
and the former captain of Jia Shi.

457
00:29:35,586 --> 00:29:39,265
They're asking why he's
joined an insignificant team.

458
00:29:39,265 --> 00:29:42,987
When Ye left Jia Shi, he
was criticized by its fans.

459
00:29:42,987 --> 00:29:45,804
Now, leading a new team on the journey of Glory,

460
00:29:45,804 --> 00:29:49,161
He has attracted more heated comments from fans.

461
00:29:51,062 --> 00:29:52,862
 

462
00:29:52,862 --> 00:29:54,060
 

463
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:55,833
 

464
00:29:55,833 --> 00:29:57,628
 

465
00:30:02,252 --> 00:30:05,961
Winning the first game, we'll be on the front pages of newspapers.

466
00:30:05,961 --> 00:30:09,163
The number of our fans will increase romantically.

467
00:30:09,163 --> 00:30:12,448
Dude, "increase dramatically".

468
00:30:12,448 --> 00:30:13,789
Whatever.

469
00:30:13,789 --> 00:30:16,757
It's our captain's first public appearance today.

470
00:30:16,757 --> 00:30:19,654
We won't have to take the bus in the future,

471
00:30:19,654 --> 00:30:21,582
we'll have our own shuttle.

472
00:30:21,582 --> 00:30:24,601
Yes, but you have to pay, 12 yuan per kilometer.

473
00:30:24,601 --> 00:30:28,343
Finally, maybe charge you
additional 1 yuan for gas.

474
00:30:28,343 --> 00:30:31,557
Why do you think we won't have a lot of fans?

475
00:30:32,374 --> 00:30:35,842
Because of... this.

476
00:30:52,713 --> 00:30:58,200
 

477
00:31:10,348 --> 00:31:12,213
 

478
00:31:12,213 --> 00:31:14,106
3 seconds before the fifth attack coming.

479
00:31:14,106 --> 00:31:17,693
Luo Ji, lock the source of attack. Others strike.

480
00:31:20,917 --> 00:31:22,866
New messages per second is exceeding 15.

481
00:31:22,866 --> 00:31:25,170
Tieba will be crashed if messages keep increasing.

482
00:31:25,170 --> 00:31:27,237
Contain it by correcting opinion direction.

483
00:31:27,237 --> 00:31:31,485
Everyone of us must proudly speak for Ye Qiu.

484
00:31:31,485 --> 00:31:33,396
Damn! Hacker.

485
00:31:33,396 --> 00:31:34,646
Asshole.

486
00:31:34,646 --> 00:31:38,550
Someday I'm going to find you and kick your ass.

487
00:31:38,550 --> 00:31:40,866
Whose ass will you kick?

488
00:31:40,866 --> 00:31:43,525
Kick the ass of...

489
00:31:43,525 --> 00:31:47,572
every team in Challenge.

490
00:31:47,572 --> 00:31:49,797
Today's training course is...

491
00:31:54,621 --> 00:31:56,087
relaxing.

492
00:32:01,041 --> 00:32:02,779
Not bad?

493
00:32:07,239 --> 00:32:09,004
Captain.

494
00:32:09,004 --> 00:32:15,875
Are you using football
sto let us know something philosophical?

495
00:32:16,909 --> 00:32:18,445
I see.

496
00:32:18,445 --> 00:32:20,337
Precision...

497
00:32:20,337 --> 00:32:25,451
Our captain wants us
to focus on the Challenge Game.

498
00:32:25,451 --> 00:32:27,352
And calmness...

499
00:32:27,352 --> 00:32:31,082
means never be confused by online comments.

500
00:32:31,082 --> 00:32:34,026
Then, concentration...

501
00:32:34,026 --> 00:32:37,478
It means we have to concentrate on our training,

502
00:32:37,478 --> 00:32:39,573
and can't be distracted.

503
00:32:39,573 --> 00:32:40,953
It's boring here.

504
00:32:40,953 --> 00:32:43,366
Let's go back to training, okay?

505
00:32:48,545 --> 00:32:49,920
Captain.

506
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:55,138
We have already understood
your good intention, right?

507
00:32:59,123 --> 00:33:02,685
The cake vouchers given by Ye Qiu
will expire tomorrow.

508
00:33:02,685 --> 00:33:06,037
They are free. Don't waste them.
Take whatever you want.

509
00:33:06,037 --> 00:33:08,441
I want another one.

510
00:33:09,338 --> 00:33:14,579
However, who will pay the fare when we go back?

511
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:22,914
Never mind. I want to stay here.

512
00:33:22,914 --> 00:33:27,547
Swearing everywhere on internet,
Jia Shi's fans seem crazy these days.

513
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:31,931
What were you talking about? Say it again.

514
00:33:31,931 --> 00:33:34,079
Stop it!

515
00:33:34,079 --> 00:33:38,361
Okay, everybody, I'll show you something.

516
00:33:38,361 --> 00:33:40,299
These guys are from Xing Xin.

517
00:33:40,299 --> 00:33:42,199
Look at these ugly faces.

518
00:33:42,199 --> 00:33:43,679
What? Don't touch me!

519
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:46,760
Come on, talk, talk to the camera.

520
00:33:47,805 --> 00:33:49,966
- Excuse me, stop shooting.
- Leave me alone.

521
00:33:49,966 --> 00:33:51,315
You're the vice-captain.

522
00:33:51,315 --> 00:33:53,853
Don't let your guys bully us here.

523
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:59,441
Come on, talk to the camera what you just said.

524
00:33:59,441 --> 00:34:02,280
- Dude...
- Come on, cut the crap.

525
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:07,607
You just said Jia Shi's fans seem crazy.

526
00:34:08,620 --> 00:34:14,220
Our captain we used to support
is fighting for another team now.

527
00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:17,146
He's fighting desperately against his former team.

528
00:34:17,146 --> 00:34:20,090
Do you understand how Jia Shi's fans are feeling?

529
00:34:20,090 --> 00:34:21,828
No.

530
00:34:29,284 --> 00:34:31,906
You don't care about Jia Shi's fans, do you?

531
00:34:34,347 --> 00:34:37,783
My game is not played for fans.

532
00:34:37,783 --> 00:34:40,576
Then for whom?

533
00:34:40,576 --> 00:34:46,736
Frankly, we are just fighting
for our personal ideals.

534
00:34:46,736 --> 00:34:50,204
Nobody would fight for pleasing others.

535
00:34:50,204 --> 00:34:52,735
So, don't get it wrong.

536
00:34:52,735 --> 00:34:56,949
We're moved by, and appreciate
your support and encouragement.

537
00:34:56,949 --> 00:35:04,686
But I have to tell you,
it's not true that we're playing for fans.

538
00:35:04,686 --> 00:35:06,732
At least,

539
00:35:07,428 --> 00:35:09,240
I'm not.

540
00:35:11,164 --> 00:35:13,544
But, without our support,

541
00:35:13,544 --> 00:35:17,936
there would be no pro games,
and of course no pro players either,

542
00:35:17,936 --> 00:35:19,685
You're right.

543
00:35:20,583 --> 00:35:22,297
That's why I appreciate it.

544
00:35:22,297 --> 00:35:26,815
I'm also moved by your support, sincerely.

545
00:35:26,815 --> 00:35:28,949
But my game

546
00:35:29,843 --> 00:35:32,070
is not played for fans.

547
00:35:32,070 --> 00:35:40,870
