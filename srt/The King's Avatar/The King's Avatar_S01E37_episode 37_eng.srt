Wait a moment.

Does boss dislike me?

42
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:48,120
Why I only got an exclamatory mark? You all have a character.

43
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:54,837

00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,320
Come on.

Let's get ready.

51
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:31,560
The adjustment of competition system
for the Challenge Final.

52
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,580
- Captain. 
 - Cancel the Individual Event.

53
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:37,220
Turn the Arena Contest from
three players to five players.

54
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:40,040
The score will be based
on how many players you kill.

55
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:42,000
You will get two points for killing one player.

56
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,700
It means that you will lose two
points for one player get killed.

57
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:48,080
The score will be enlarged if we are heedless.

58
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:53,700
I can figure out more than
six ways to comeback by now.

59
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:56,400
But we only have one choice.

60
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,711
Smile for the camera.

61
00:03:59,711 --> 00:04:04,480
 

62
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,720
Just look over there when we take pictures later.

63
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:11,760
This adjustment will not
only leads to our victory,

64
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:16,600
we will also crush them by the biggest score gap in history. Am I right?

65
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,700
We will get two points by killing one player.

66
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:23,900
There will be two bonus points if we can kill them all within the prescribed time.

67
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:29,980
Do you ever think it will give the Xing Xin Team the same chance to comeback?

68
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:34,660
Could you please shut up? If you can't say something nice, don't say anything at all.

69
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,300
We won't give anyone a chance.

70
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,000
We can't take the risk.

71
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,040
Each killing counts.

72
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,800
- Are you with me or not?
- Fine. Fine.

73
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,240
Let's take photos. Come on!

74
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:55,348
Here. Get ready.

75
00:04:55,348 --> 00:04:56,544
Is there still one person missing?

76
00:04:56,544 --> 00:04:58,360
Let's have a look. 
  

77
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:02,000
I found a very famous coach in this field.

78
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,800
And helped you to develop a
whole training program for you.

79
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,320
In the next three years...

80
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:10,040
- You can see that... 
 - Three years?

81
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,760
Right.

82
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:19,480
Your contract with Jia Shi is about to expire.

83
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:21,900
Here. A brand new contract.

84
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:24,700
Just check and sign it.

85
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:27,220
It's just a process.

86
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:33,000
Mr. Tao, I won't sign an extension with Jia Shi.

87
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,600
I will leave here as long as the contract expires.

88
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:40,500
Don't you think about it?

89
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:43,880
I am sorry. I want a fresh start.

90
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,720
Are you...

91
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,820
going to join Xing Xin Team?

92
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,700
I will go to take pictures first.

93
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:54,460
What's wrong?

94
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:57,660
Do you want to leave Jia Shi in such a hurry?

95
00:05:57,660 --> 00:06:01,800
Can you play well in such a state?

96
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:09,000
I'm a professional eSports player.

97
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:14,300
As long as I am a member of Jia Shi, I will try my best to win.

98
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,560
No one knows if you're
doing your best in the match.

99
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:23,960
Who knows? What a pity!

100
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:30,320
Since you put it that way, I won't let you play in the final.

101
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:35,000
What a pity! Till now...

102
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,140
You don't know what's the
meaning of professional players.

103
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:46,120
Refine the make-up.

104
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:56,280
You! Stand there! Just stand there!

105
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,840
Captain, this is your central position.

106
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:00,480
The central position is at where I stand.

107
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,400
Here. Get ready!

108
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,600

Your contract is about to expire after this match.

00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:46,120
Are you going to have a contract extension?

148
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:49,320
Sorry, this is our internal arrangement.

149
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:51,800
It's inconvenient to disclose now.

150
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,520
You were the dream ticket before, but becomes opponents now.

151
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:56,180
It's a hot topic in the last three days. What's your opinion?

152
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:58,480
Are you going to fight with Ye Qiu today?

153
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,000
Or you are not going to enter the field tonight?

154
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,880
Su Mu Cheng, it's said that you are going to join Xing Xin.

155
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:04,520
Are you going to avoid doing anything that may arouse suspicion?

156
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,200
Don't worry, everybody!

157
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:12,160
Mu Cheng is a professional player.

158

What's your feeling to against your previous employer?

159
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,040
Are you still communicating in private?

160
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:27,120
What's your plan in the next
if you fail to join the league?

161
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,520
Right, what's your plan in the next?

162
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:29,380
- Master Ye, please tell us more.
- Thank you.

163
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:30,980
Yeah, please tell us more.

164

Miss Tang. You said you will do the one-against-three in public before the match with Zhu Xian.

00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,520
You would resign if you can't.

166
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:40,200
So are you here to cheer today?

167
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,640
I am here to play.

168
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:43,440
Are you going to disavow your public statement?

169
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,300
You broke your promise.
How can you just let it go?

170
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,360
I am sorry.

171
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:50,680
I didn't fulfill my promise.

172
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,760
I let Xing Xin's fans down.

173
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:56,160
Today,

174
00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:00,220
I apologize for my recklessness and impulsiveness.

175
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:08,520
But I won't quit.

176
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:13,500
I will stick with it even I
have to break my promise.

177
00:11:16,931 --> 00:11:18,920
There is obviously a huge
gap between you and Jia Shi.

178
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:19,880
And the rules have changed in final.

179
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:23,275
- You have no chance to win so far.
- Can you win?

180
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:28,540
You don't know until you try.

181
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,520
Let's go.

182
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:37,480
They are having huge advantages. So they will keep it steadily.

183
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:39,600
I think they will use conventional tactics.

184
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,880
Tang, you take the lead in the Arena Contest.

185
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:43,440
If everything goes well,
your opponent is Sun Xiang.

186
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,000
- Just keep to play it intrepidly and to infuriate him duly.
- I see.

187
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,320
You are the next. Play it
rhythmically to consume his patience.

188
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:53,240
Yi Fan, you are the third one. Beat him by using outflanking tactics.

189
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,760
Wei Chen and I...

190
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,440
will do the rest.

191
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,920
No problem.

192
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,320
And...

193
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,880
Where is our boss?

194
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:07,220
I've handed the list accurately.

195
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:14,760
Tonight is a night of glory for all of us.

196
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:16,480
Fighting!

197
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:27,760
Everyone, listen to me.

198
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:30,760
We can do nothing on the stage.
But we can cheer up for them.

199
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:32,880
Let us practice our slogan again.

200
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:33,720
Okay.

201
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,360
Fans are everywhere!

202
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,520
Fans are everywhere!

203
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:39,240
Xing Xin, you are irreplaceable!

204
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:41,320
Xing Xin, you are irreplaceable!

205
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:43,060
Fans are everywhere!

206
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:44,920
Fans are everywhere!

207
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:46,440
Xing Xin, you are irreplaceable!

208
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,480
Xing Xin, you are irreplaceable!

209
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:51,240
We must pay attention to the rhythm and our vigour. And our motions also.

210
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:52,840
Just take a break.

211
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,760
Here. Here.

212
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,240
Just take this. All right.

213
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,600
Here. Just take it.

214
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,601
Here. Here. Here.

215
00:12:58,601 --> 00:13:01,240
This is nice.

216
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:03,040
Come here. Take it.

217
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:05,480
This color really suits you. Here. I help you to wear it.

218
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:07,539
Just wear it.

219
00:13:07,539 --> 00:13:09,284
Has everybody got it? Here. Here.

220
00:13:09,284 --> 00:13:12,084
 

221
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,880
Han... Han Wen Qing.

222
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,040
Zhang Xinjie. Wang Jie Xi.

223
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,760
It's really them.

224
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:38,440
So many masters are here.

225
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,640
Bro, what a blockbuster!

226
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:42,580
Hello, Zhou Zekai. Where are you? What's wrong?

227
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:45,460
You can't put on airs to me for you are handsome and popular.

228
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:46,840
I tell you what. The game is going to begin.

229
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:48,000
We are all waiting for you.

230
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,060
Just tell me if you are coming or not. Hello?

231
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:52,800
- The sponsor invited him to do the commentary.
- Will Zhou Zekai come here too?

232
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,040
How can you ignore me?

233
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,040
What's wrong with your sponsor?

234
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,440
To invite him to do the commentary?

235
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,800
The cost performance is too low.

236
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,240
Although he is the most handsome in the league.

237
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,480
So what?

238
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,640
To do the commentary, your
eloquence need to be excellent.

239
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:06,560
He is so tedious but charging too much.

240
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:07,960
It's better to put a humanoid card board here.

241
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,960
It's the same.

242
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:13,760
Huang Shao Tian, you are careful
to offend his fans.

243
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,560
It's okay. His fans won't know.

244
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:18,240
- These microphones are already on.
- Right.

245
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:34,320
Welcome to the Challenge Final of Glory.

246
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:39,900
Tonight, we are honor to be here
to witness the birth of a champion.

247
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:45,000
The victory will go to our ever-victorious general
or will it goes to our new star?

248
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,800
Let's see.

249
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,600
We will use new rules tonight.

250
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,840
There will be the Arena Contest
and the Team Competition.

251
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:54,760
They will dispatch six players
each to play the Arena Contest.

252
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:57,160
The score will base on how
many opponents they kill.

253
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:58,920
They will get two points for killing one opponent.

254
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:01,360
And all the bonus rules will be remained.

255
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,880
Jia Shi Team got twenty
four points in the group stage.

256
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:05,920
And Xing Xin Team got twenty one points.

257
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:09,120
So Jia Shi Team has a three
points advantage in the final.

258
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,560
Tonight, our commentators are...

259
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:14,120
The captain of Lanyu Team, Yu Wen Zhou.

260
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,460
Hello.

261
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:16,881
- And...
- Hello.

262
00:15:16,881 --> 00:15:19,120
I am the best Swordsman of
both talent and beauty in history.

263
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,201
I am Huang Shao Tian. Okay. Let's cut the crap.

264
00:15:21,201 --> 00:15:22,360
Let's get down to business.

265
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:25,101
Let's see. Who are going to play in the first round?

266
00:15:25,101 --> 00:15:26,200
Alright.
 

267
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,040
Xing Xin Team is going
to appoint Tang Rou first.

268
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:29,800
Her role is Han Yan Rou.

269
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:30,800
A Battlemage.

270
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:31,681
Fighting! Tang!

271
00:15:31,681 --> 00:15:33,120
Even she plays the Glory less than one year,

272
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,560
but her style is so tough.

273
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:37,760
And she comes to the fore
quickly with exceptional talent.

274
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:40,120
Let's see who will represent
Jia Shi to play the first round.

275
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:42,040
It's him.

276
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:44,080
Jia Shi Team is going to
appointment Xiao Shi Qin first.

277
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:47,160
His role is Sheng Ling Mie. A Mechanic.

278
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:50,500
Jia Shi gave up their frequently-used tactics.

279
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:53,600
Captain. Although Sun Xiang is so reckless,

280
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,920
he always want to take the first formation.

281
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,440
But he didn't this time.

282
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,160
Has he become smarter?

283
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:01,320
Captain. Captain. Captain.

284
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:07,680
Captain. Captain. Captain.

285
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,920
They must thought that I
will be the first one to play.

286
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,740
Mistake!

287
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:20,400
Be humble.

288
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:22,480
I am telling the truth.

289
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,100
Fighting!

290
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:33,880
Fighting!

291
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:35,920
Fighting! Fighting! Fighting!

292
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:38,160
Fighting! Fighting! Fighting!

293
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,640
Fighting!

294
00:16:41,733 --> 00:16:45,017
 

295
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:49,480
Jia Shi Team appoints
Xiao Shi Qin to take the lead.

296
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:52,160
They must made some adjustments
according to the new rules.

297
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,400
We don't know if it's in Xing Xin's plan.

298
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:56,480
What should we do now?

299
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:59,400
Our previous deployments were all messed up.

300
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:03,280
Tang Rou and Mo Fan will
be restrained by Xiao Shi Qin.

301
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:08,180
Tang said she will insist even
she has to break her promise.

302
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,144
Besides, it's just Xiao Shi Qin now.

303
00:17:12,144 --> 00:17:13,760
 

304
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,320
The Challenge Final of Glory.

305
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:17,800
The first round of Arena
Contest is going to begin.

306
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:20,000
Tang Rou, Han Yan Rou vs. Xiao Shi Qin, Sheng Ling Mie.

307
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,520
Captain Yu, what do you think about it?

308
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,480
Each has its advantages and disadvantages.

309
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:25,360
I think Tang Rou is likely to win.

310
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:26,960
Her APM will make Xiao Shi Qin get rattled.

311
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:29,440
It's time to let newbie to show themselves.

312
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,640
Meets with Xiao Shi Qin, the master of tactics,

313
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:33,640
can Tang Rou cover the
shortage by her excellent APM?

314
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:35,320
Let's wait and see.

315
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:37,560
Okay. The game began.

316
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:39,280
We can saw that Tang Rou stick to her own style.

317
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,240
She rushed at the central of map at first.

318
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:43,320
The fight between Mechanic and Battlemage.

319
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:45,840
Xiao Shi Qin will take the advantage of far shot.

320
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,520
He will choose to consume her in distant.

321
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,040
Sheng Ling Mie found himself get discovered.

322
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:51,420
He chose to pull away immediately.

323
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:01,460
Han Yan Rou, got hit!

324
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:05,800
Han Yan Rou adjusted
herself quickly and fought back.

325
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,640
Tang Rou is so tough.

326
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:19,240
How could she fight back in such a situation?

327
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:21,260
Mechanical tracking will slow people down.

328
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:24,740
So the first choice is supposed to defend. Or to dodge.

329
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:26,640
But Tang Rou chose to storm.

330
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,560
She'd rather to take the sacrifice of ultimate,

331
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:31,460
but still want to strike to approach him.

332
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:33,800
Xiao Shi Qin was caught off guard.

333
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,200
Ladies and gentlemen, did you see that?

334
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:38,200
These masters of tactics are so cunning usually.

335
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,900
We need some unconventional
players to teach them a lesson.

336
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:43,880
It's really exciting, right?

337
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,400
Sheng Ling Mie throw a bounding mine.

338
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,240
Han Yan Rou was unaware. She is in danger.

339
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:53,060
But she avoided it as well. How could she realized?

340
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:54,700
Was it a coincidence? Or was it her intuition?

341
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:58,380
None. She can catch the sound precisely.

342
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:02,960
As a pianist, her hearing is much sharper than ordinary person.

343
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:07,240
Xiao Shi Qin made a mistake by using Sound Trap.

344
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:08,880
Bravo!

345
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:11,940
Even Xiao Shi Qin couldn't do anything about her.

346
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:14,040
Don't jump to conclusions.

347
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:17,760
He is one of the best four tacticians in Glory.

348
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:20,320
Xiao Shi Qin.

349
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:21,560
Sheng Ling Mie chose to use the Air Drops.

350
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:23,780
He wanted to astrict her blocking.

351
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:26,880
But Tang Rou is calm.

352
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:52,440
Han Yan Rou lost track of her opponent.

353
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:54,180
Shao Tian, let's guess.

354
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:57,860
As a master of tactics and a sharpie, what will he do next?

355
00:19:57,860 --> 00:19:59,640
He will use his strange weapons,

356
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:01,681
to make this fight goes into the
environment that best suits him.

357
00:20:01,681 --> 00:20:04,800
Whatever he do, I hope Tang Rou can break the predicament and win.

358
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:07,060
It seems like Han Yan Rou
can't judge his intentions now.

359
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:09,440
She moved prudently.

360
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:12,760
Sheng Ling Mie used his trick again.

361
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:15,960
Threw out two bounding mines by using Sound Trap.

362
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:19,320
Han Yan Rou avoided them faultlessly.

363
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:20,660
It didn't work at all.

364
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:22,880
Why he chose to used this trick again?

365
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:26,400
He didn't want to consume her HP.

366
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:30,000
But to guide Tang Rou into his trap.

367
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:34,320
Game over.

368
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:37,380
The damage of the skill has been calculated.

369
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:39,820
It's about time.

370
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:42,060
Got hit! Han Yan Rou was dead.

371
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:44,540
Sheng Ling Mie led her into
his own rhythm gradually.

372
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:49,460
And won the first round by 70% HP have left.

373
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:53,900
How could it be?

374
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:58,080
It's impossible.

375
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,560
Tang played it well all the time.

376
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:03,440
She has eluded so many attacks.

377
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,680
How could she lose?

378
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:08,440
Tang is quick in action and plays valiantly.

379
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:11,300
She is a talented offensive player.

380
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:16,080
Xiao Shi Qin used her
fortes to defeat her tactfully.

381
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:19,400
What do you mean?

382
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:24,120
Tang will get tired when
she plays in high frequency.

383
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:48,760
Indeed. She will become a fearful rival as Ye Qiu.

384
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:53,800
As a tactician, we always look for opponents'
loopholes to win the game.

385
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:57,460
But Tang Rou chose to look
for opportunities to fight back

386
00:21:57,460 --> 00:22:00,780
She still chose to storm even
in the most dangerous of times.

387
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:04,520
There's nothing impossible in Glory.

388
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:22,560
Although Xing Xin has lost the first round, but Tang Rou, as a newbie,

389
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:26,200
has put lots of pressure on
Jia Shi by her performance.

390
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:29,460
Although she lost the game, but we knew that...

391
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:32,380
There's a rising Battlemage star in Glory.

392
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:35,040
She is Tang Rou.

393
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:37,160
Fighting!

394
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:38,240
It's okay.

395
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,120
Fighting! Fighting!

396
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:42,141
- You did well! 
 - Fighting!

397
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,640
How do you feel?

398
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,040
How about it?

399
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,520
I am so depressed.

400
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:57,040
Xiao Shi Qin is the most
horrible opponent I've met.

401
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:04,660
It's not a big deal.

402
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:07,680
Yeah. It's not a big deal.

403
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:09,660
Xiao Shi Qin is so skillful.

404
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:15,200
No one has the confidence to defeat him in the whole league.

405
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:18,160
There are always winners and losers.

406
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:22,760
I know. But I couldn't do anything about him.

407
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:27,160
I didn't have any initiative
even though I tried my best.

408
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:31,080
If this problem can be solved easily,

409
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:34,320
then I can teach you before you go to the stage.

410
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:38,560
What you're dealing with right now, is the highest level player in Glory.

411
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:41,160
He wouldn't be where he is today

412
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:43,741
if he has some huge loopholes
that can be used by others.

413
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:48,200
Keep trying! Enrich yourself comprehensively!

414
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:50,960
There will be no shortcuts from now on.

415
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,900
Captain is right!

416
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:03,680
The Glory is so hard to play.

417
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:11,200
That's why it's interesting, right?

418
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:14,760
It's really interesting.

419
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:17,560
The next player from Xing Xin is Mo Fan.
 

420
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:19,240
He is a former Scrap Picker whose action is

421
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:21,920
fast, accurate and relentless
and good at biding his time.

422
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:24,280
Can he break through the
encirclement set by Xiao Shi Qin?

423
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:25,560
And fight his way out.

424
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:28,280
Let's wait and see.

425
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:31,280
The second round of Arena Contest.

426
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:33,280
Xing Xin chose to dispatch their Ninja, Deception.

427
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:36,040
To challenge Jia Shi's Mechanic, Sheng Ling Mie.

428
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:50,700
Xiao Shi Qin, such an old fox...

429
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:52,600
As a master of tactics,
although he won last round,

430
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:54,481
but his HP was consumed by Tang Rou.

431
00:24:54,481 --> 00:24:57,420
Deception, fighting! You still have the chance to win!

432
00:24:57,420 --> 00:25:00,100
Okay. Game Started! Deception is moving rapidly at the beginning.

433
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:03,200
He is finding the right place to hide himself.

434
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:10,480
This is a very typical opening for Ninja.

435
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:11,940
They will take the high ground first.

436
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:15,500
And to use the advantage
of vision to find opportunities.

437
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:18,480
It seems like Mo Fan has
the chance to break through.

438
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:22,140
Sheng Ling Mie released the Electronic Eyes to seek for Deception's position.

439
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:24,000
Xiao Shi Qin knows Deception's strategy.

440
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,201
He is in patience.

441
00:25:25,201 --> 00:25:27,820
He won't give Deception a chance to sneak attack.

442
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:30,800
Please don't hide anymore. It's boring. Just fight!

443
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:32,620
Just fight face to face if you are real men.

444
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:36,000
You are the most famous chance taker in league.

445
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,320
You often use this tactic.

446
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:40,840
It means that your opponent
can't find you for ages.

447
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:43,200
I just wait for chances to make no mistakes.

448
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,520
But they are so cheeky now.

449
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:46,500
We are different. You know?

450
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:48,820
You are so facetious. Okay. Back to the game.

451
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:52,000
The Electronic Eyes is still
seeking for Deception's position.

452
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:54,800
Deception used the shuriken.

453
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:56,980
He destroyed the Electronic Eyes.

454
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:05,720
Okay. We can see that
Sheng Ling Mie is taking actions.

455
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:09,540
It seems like he is heading for Deception's rear.

456
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:12,940
Sheng Ling Mie has detected Deception's position.

457
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:15,660
Xiao Shi Qin chose to rush at him directly.

458
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:17,440
But not to detour him from sides.

459
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:20,380
Maybe he wants to find out
Deception as soon as possible.

460
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:22,960
Mo Fan knew that shuriken
would expose his own position.

461
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:26,080
So when he used this skill, he chose to move at the same time.

462
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:42,360
Deception attacked.

463
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:44,140
He used the ultimate, Moon-Slaying Sakura.

464
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:45,080
It was too close.

465
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:48,680
Sheng Ling Mie couldn't avoid it but to take it.

466
00:26:56,100 --> 00:27:00,200
We could see that after Sheng Ling Mie got hit.

467
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:02,760
He launched a counterattack.

468
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:07,060
Mechanical Tracking. Deception got hit again.

469
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:09,300
Sheng Ling Mie is still attacking. Astrict his dodging by using bounding mine.

470
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:13,400
Body Replacement Technique. Deception is adjusting his own position.

471
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:16,640
Disappearing Body Technique after detonated bombs by using shuriken.

472
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,860
He avoided the Air Drops.

473
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:55,060
Mechanical Punch! Got hit!

474
00:27:55,060 --> 00:27:57,660
Deception's HP is going to be zero.

475
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:05,100
In last moment, all the skills of Deception are freezing.

476
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:07,080
They can figure out
opponents' skills will be frozen.

477
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:10,575
This is the biggest difference between professional players and ordinary players.

478
00:28:10,575 --> 00:28:14,560
Mo Fan needs time to practice.

479
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,920
What should we do?

480
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,840
Nice! Nice!

481
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:33,420
Sheng Ling Mie from Jia Shi killed Deception.

482
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:35,200
He did the one-against-two.

483
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:39,900
Sheng Ling Mie's HP is 51% after two rounds.

484
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:42,100
He got four points.

485
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:10,300
Jia Shi Team got four
points by killing two rivals.

486
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:12,100
Xing Xin didn't get any points.

487
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:14,220
The score on the field is four to zero now.

488
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:16,480
Xiao Shi Qin hold the upper hand

489
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:19,040
in this fight between Mechanic and Ninja.

490
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:21,260
Xing Xin didn't get any
points in the first two rounds.

491
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:26,220
And two of its players got killed. The situation is not optimistic.

492
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:35,000
Sometimes, it's better to keep your skills.

493
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:38,340
I see.

494
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:40,220
If I have another match...

495
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:42,640
Sure we will.

496
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,700
There are nine points gap
between Xing Xin and Jia Shi.

497
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:53,420
Xing Xin is going to dispatch Qiao Yi Fan.

498
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:55,600
If he can't win in the third round,

499
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:58,400
I think it will be hard for Xing Xin to comeback.

500
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:05,710
Yi Fan, fighting! Yi Fan, fighting!

501
00:30:05,710 --> 00:30:12,540
Yi Fan, fighting! Yi Fan, fighting!

502
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:13,980
Yi Fan, fighting!

503
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:15,920
Yi Fan, fighting!

504
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:19,300
Sorry. Excuse me.

505
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:22,700
You are from Wei Cao...

506
00:30:29,735 --> 00:30:32,504
 

507
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:41,260
Qiao Yi Fan, fighting!

508
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:55,240
Fighting!

509
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:24,760
The third round of Arena Contest.

510
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:27,780
Yi Cun Hui vs. Sheng Ling Mie. Game started.

511
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:31,040
Yi Cun Hui chose tactical positioning. But Sheng Ling Mie already knew it.

512
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:33,560
He got intercepted halfway.

513
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:46,340
Sheng Ling Mie hold the upper hand.

514
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:49,500
It's not good for Yi Cun Hui.

515
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:52,400
Yi Fan, fighting!

516
00:31:53,582 --> 00:31:57,624
Leaping onto the wall, Qiao
launches a counterattack...

517
00:31:57,624 --> 00:31:59,708
while Xiao is alternating his skill strikes.

518
00:32:17,331 --> 00:32:21,556
But Arrays of Ice and Plague
may not enough to turn the tide.

519
00:32:21,556 --> 00:32:24,357
He should use more Arrays of Ghosts...

520
00:32:24,357 --> 00:32:27,474
and cause high damage to
enemy by the Feast of Ghosts.

521
00:32:40,222 --> 00:32:41,582
What happened?

522
00:32:41,582 --> 00:32:43,600
Why did Xiao rush in the opposite direction?

523
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:46,700
Tell us why, Captain Yu.

524
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:50,000
Director, please replay these frames.

525
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,400
Yeah, it's here.

526
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:53,900
Xiao was shooting with his rifle
at the same direction,

527
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:56,200
then hit the air with his Mechanical Punch.

528
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:58,968
But nobody was here, Captain Yu.

529
00:32:58,968 --> 00:33:01,789
Let's see from Xiao's view.

530
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:04,400
What...

531
00:33:05,328 --> 00:33:08,807
Shao Tian, have you seen it?

532
00:33:08,807 --> 00:33:11,589
It must be an afterimage that looks very real.

533
00:33:11,589 --> 00:33:14,532
It's not surprising that Xiao mistook it for Qiao.

534
00:33:14,532 --> 00:33:16,762
But I think it must be a coincidence,

535
00:33:16,762 --> 00:33:19,092
because a Ghost has no
skill creating an afterimage.

536
00:33:19,092 --> 00:33:23,200
So Xiao was just unlucky and
fell into the trap for no reason.

537
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,800
I don't think so.

538
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:28,932
The afterimage just appeared
in a right place at a right time.

539
00:33:28,932 --> 00:33:30,654
It was Visual Deception.

540
00:33:30,654 --> 00:33:33,700
Visual Deception?

541
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:36,200
What the hell is it?

542
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:38,752
These frames just frightened me.

543
00:33:38,752 --> 00:33:49,210
