 "Light From the Ashes" - Cai Weize 

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:06,100
♫  Countless fireflies born from insignificance  ♫

3
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:09,990
♫  Riding the long wind to gather into a shining galaxy  ♫

4
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:13,920
♫  Proclaim to the world on top of the sky  ♫

5
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:18,890
♫  We will return in glory  ♫

6
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,760
♫  Clear the clouds and descend with the heat  ♫

7
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,480
♫  Melting ice and snow, overcoming twists and turns  ♫

8
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:31,300
♫  Finally at this moment of peak  ♫

9
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:35,300
♫  There is a figure that coincides with the past  ♫

10
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:39,140
♫  The glory of the past that never came  ♫

11
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:42,600
♫  The pride that the future will never pass  ♫

12
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:46,540
♫  Our fingertips intertwined and condensed  ♫

13
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:50,420
♫  Into a song that ignited the battlefield  ♫

14
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:54,140
♫  The only light in an endless night  ♫

15
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:58,060
♫  Is you and me who overcame mediocrity  ♫

16
00:00:58,060 --> 00:01:01,950
♫  Up on the clouds and down in the dust  ♫

17
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:05,820
♫  Fireflies making every effort to illuminate  ♫

18
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:09,550
♫  I came from the legend to carry on a legend  ♫

19
00:01:09,550 --> 00:01:13,520
♫  Once it's disruptive, a decade of persistence won't be in vain  ♫

20
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:17,370
♫  Up on the clouds and down in the dust  ♫

21
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:21,150
♫  Fireflies making every effort to illuminate  ♫

22
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:24,750
♫  Fireflies making every effort to illuminate  ♫

23
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:27,960
   

24
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:30,800
   

25
00:01:32,812 --> 00:01:34,932
Do I need to continue asking?

26
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,600
Captain, it's like this... He started it.

27
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,720
He asked me to attack the Dungeon with him...

28
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:42,940
I said no.

29
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:44,920
Then he threatened and tempted me...

30
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:47,210
Then he said he wanted to finish something that wasn't yet complete;

31
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:48,320
revive some sort of umbrella.

32
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,320
And he said he would add some excitement to Glory...

33
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,860
- I told him not to do it... 
 - Wait a minute.

34
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:55,140
He really said that?

35
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:57,613
His words were like this.

36
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:07,020
"I will add more excitement to Glory."

37
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:10,720
That's what he said. He was serious.

38
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:14,660
I'd be Sun Xiang if I'm lying... I'm telling the truth.

39
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:16,620
Sorry, Old Ye.

40
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,240
You had time to attack Dungeons after the competition.

41
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:22,400
It seems that you don't get enough training.

42
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,840
Captain, didn't you just say we'd turn over a new leaf?

43
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:27,980
- You'll keep your promise, right? 
 - No.

44
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:30,580
- Unless... 
 - Unless what?

45
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:33,580
Get me the Myriad Manifestation Umbrella.

46
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:35,410
Isn't that stealing...

47
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:39,140
Captain, isn't that a bit shameless?

48
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:41,560
Look. Blue Rain has always been aboveboard.

49
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:44,560
- Is it... 
 - How can this be shameless?

50
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,520
We'll just borrow it for research purposes.

51
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:50,620
We will return it when it's done.

52
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:53,360
By the way, you may not be able to beat him.

53
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,820
Captain, you should be responsible for what you say.

54
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:57,140
I can't beat him?

55
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:58,760
Listen to me. With my current abilities,

56
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:00,760
I could beat his umbrella into a stick in minutes.

57
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:03,530
Good. Three hours. I'll wait for you.

58
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:06,570
Only three hours?

59

60
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:18,860
 When will you finish that training camp competition with me, 

61
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:21,840
 Ye Qiu. Master.  

62
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:26,721
 - Quickly, quickly, quickly. 
 - Go, go, go. 

63
00:03:26,721 --> 00:03:29,660
 - Nice! Don't rush it.  
 - Watch me succeed.

64
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:31,680
You're not good. Why are you so slow?

65
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,580
 - You don't have many skills left. Come on. 
 - Use your ult. Hurry! 

66
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,020
 - Nice! 
 - Go, we've got a chance. 

67
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:41,700
 - Not bad! 
 - That was easy. 

68
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:42,960
How many matches have you won successively?

69
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,380
You see, Yu Wenshou is weak.

70
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:47,341
He's too slow. How can he compare with you?

71
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,740
Be quiet.

72
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,480
I'd like to announce one thing to you all.

73
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:05,240
Our training camp will officially start the evaluations tomorrow.

74
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,880
Last place in the evaluation will be eliminated.

75
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,780
Is everyone clear?

76
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:11,640
 - Don't go. 
 - Don't leave. 

77
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:14,340
Yu Wenzhou, you are the only student I've ever seen

78
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:18,040
who has never won in the regular matches.

79
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,080
If you lose again this time, you would be eliminated.

80
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,600
If you want to stay in esports,

81
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,380
then you have to work hard.

82
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:29,580
Got it.

83
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:31,240
All right, everyone.

84
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:34,400
Line up and draw lots to choose your opponent.

85
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,840
 - You first. Quickly.  
 - I'm heading back first.

86
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,120
 You first. 

87
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,420
 - Don't be shy. 
 - Draw one. 

88
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:41,060
 - Don't be shy. 
 - You'll just lose anyway. 

89
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:44,040
 - Just draw a lot. 
 - Seriously? You're slow even when drawing lots? 

90
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:46,400
 Come on. Quickly. 

91
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,240
 - Take a look. 
 - Who is it? Open it. 

92
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,980
 - Quickly. 
 - Come on, who is it? 

93
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:54,980
 Who is it? 
   

94
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:57,300
- Don't hide it. 
  - Right. 

95
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:59,760
Goodness! It's Ye Qiu.

96
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,360
 Ye Qiu? 

97
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,520
 You won the first prize. 

98
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:06,440
 You've never won, and he has never lost. 

99
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:08,860
-  We even don't need to guess. 
 - Yeah. 

100
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:10,400
 Good luck. 

101
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,760
 Good luck. 

102
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:12,880
 It's okay. 

103
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,760
 My classmates' mockery 

104
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:17,820
 made me felt utterly worthless. 

105
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:21,380
 So I started intensely practicing all night without rest. 

106
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,540
 Warlock versus Battlemage. 

107
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:33,720
 It'll be a very tough match. 

108
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:38,840
 The only turning point is whether I can release Cursed Arrow or not. 

109
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:47,740
 But it'll take ten seconds to cast a spell to get the maximum charge. 

110
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:50,180
 It is impossible for me not to be interrupted. 

111
00:05:52,755 --> 00:05:57,863
♫  Failure is like the dawn of victory  ♫

112
00:05:57,863 --> 00:06:02,140
♫  So what if we start over again  ♫

113
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:04,040
 The only possible way 

114
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:07,160
 is to completely control him for ten seconds. 

115
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:12,897
♫  Accompanied by confidence and strength  ♫

116
00:06:12,897 --> 00:06:17,005
♫  Even if beaten to flee with wounds and bruises  ♫

117
00:06:17,005 --> 00:06:19,000
 I can only stall him for five seconds. 

118
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,520
 The casting would still be interrupted. 

119
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:24,900
 I must find a way to stall for another five seconds. 

120
00:06:27,112 --> 00:06:32,351
♫  We must give it our all to win the battle  ♫

121
00:06:32,351 --> 00:06:37,440
♫  We laugh and cry, secretly grieving over failures  ♫

137
00:07:56,566 --> 00:07:58,440
 He's doomed. 

138
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:03,621
 - There's no suspense. 
 - There's no way he can win. 

139
00:08:03,621 --> 00:08:05,080
 There is no suspense. 

140
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:07,280
 - They're starting 
 - It's starting. 

141
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,880
Dragon Tooth Sprint. Master Ye is starting off so fiercely.

142
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:25,481
- No mercy at all. 
 - Sprint at the beginning?

143
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,260
Look up into the sky.

144
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:27,920
 Master Ye Qiu. 

145
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,120
 Five. 

146
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,880
 Four. 

147
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,440
 Three. 

148
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,200
 Two. 

149
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,280
 One! 

150
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:04,920
   
(*Good game) 

151
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:10,300
   

152
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:13,320
 Two minutes and eighteen seconds. 

153
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:17,180
 It became the driving force for me to work harder. 

154
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:18,900
 Ye Qiu also became 

155
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:22,500
 the opponent that I wanted to meet the most in a match. 

156
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:26,000
It's done.

157
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:32,980
Captain, please wait a minute.

158
00:11:41,381 --> 00:11:43,260
- What's this? 
 - Myriad Manifestation Umbrella.

159
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:46,281
Captain, let me report. I strictly followed your instructions.

160
00:11:46,281 --> 00:11:49,600
I successfully and quickly got it. Mission completed.

161
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:58,740
Hey, why does Team Blue Rain steal things in such a high-key fashion?

162
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:00,860
It's outright robbery.

163
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,080
Long time no see.

164
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:12,180
Long time no see.

165
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:17,400
You two heartless...

166
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:20,940
...heartfeltly good friends rarely get to meet.

167
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:22,740
Why don't you have a friendly chat to improve your friendship?

168
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:25,240
I'll take this with me and go now. Bye.

169
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,900
Are you very interested in my Myriad Manifestation Umbrella?

170
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:37,120
I'd like to see the power of the Myriad Manifestation Umbrella and the Unspecialized class.

171
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:52,620
I owe you that. Two minutes and eighteen seconds.

172
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,400
I owe that to myself.

173
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:59,290
Two minutes and eighteen seconds.

174
00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:02,140
   

175
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:40,540
You hide yourself to prevent interruption.

176
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:42,781
- Very skilled. 
 - You flatter me.

177
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:55,860
It's a divine equipment indeed.

178
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:59,300
It seems that your casting speed has also improved.

179
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:02,200
But that's as far as it goes.

180
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,640
   

181
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,940
Oh? You've got another move.

182
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:20,580
   

183
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,160
Did you give it your all this time?

184
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:33,620
I give it my all in every match.

185
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,840
   

186
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,500
Myriad Manifestation Umbrella paired with an Unspecialized.

187
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:46,300
Maybe it can really change the League's structure.

188
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,920
It's just...

189
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:53,160
Maybe you can rely on the Myriad Manifestation Umbrella

190
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:56,120
and Unspecialized's various skills to make a difference now.

191
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:02,920
But how are you going to pass Heavenly Domain's challenge?

192
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:05,700
I'm not like you.

193
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:08,200
Thinking too much will kill too many brain cells.

194
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,840
If you have the time, I think you should first think about

195
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:14,000
how to prevent Huang Shaotian from running around.

196
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,900
Ye Qiu.

197
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:25,780
I hope that the next time I see you,

198
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:28,000
you can add some excitement to Glory.

199
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:50,240
 We all suffer pains while we're growing. 

200
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:54,440
 In the world of Glory, we've learned to make peace with ourselves. 

201
00:17:02,970 --> 00:17:07,140
   

202
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:08,760
Okay, come on, let's smile.

203
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:10,500
Three, two, one.

204
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:13,860
Good. Okay, arms crossed over your chest.

205
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:16,320
Good. Three, two, one.

206
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:18,120
Good.

207
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:21,140
Let's look this way at a 45-degree angle. Over here.

208
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:24,561
Okay. Three, two, one.

209
00:17:28,781 --> 00:17:29,840
No, still not good.

210
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:33,400
- His eyes are too obvious. 
 - Right. One is still big and the other is small.

211
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,700
All right. It's okay. I'll adjust them again.

212
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:37,981
- Make both eyes bigger. 
 - All right.

213
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:45,460
Let me try.

214
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:48,500
Hold onto it.

215
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:51,620
Look at a 45-degree angle.

216
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:57,700
- This works. 
 - This time, the picture is good.

217
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:59,840
- Good. 
 - His eyes now look the same.

218
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:02,160
   

219
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,800
- Captain. 
 - Go ahead. What is it?

220
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:09,800
Recently, a guy called Lord Grim appeared in the 10th Server.

221
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:12,120
All the guilds are not peaceful now.

222
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:14,600
I suspect that he's a professional player from another team

223
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,740
who is causing trouble for us.

224
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,500
This is the end of today's work.

225
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,700
Today's task is very arduous.

226
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:40,300
- Are you ready? 
 - I'm ready.

227
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:42,340
I'm ready.

228
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,700
Forty seven.

229
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:05,140
Forty eight.

230
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:07,140
How are you doing?

231
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,000
Fifty three.

232
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,400
It's so unfair.

233
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,900
You can fight a group, while I can only fight one-on-one.

234
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:19,080
Your attack speed is faster than mine.

235
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,200
The Boss we're fighting this time is Toya.

236
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,700
It's not too difficult to defeat him.

237
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:30,200
But the reason why he hasn't been defeated for so long

238
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,660
is because of the steps we take before we can fight the Boss.

239
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:33,000
They're closely linked.

240
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,200
They are not only trivial but also time-limited.

241
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,900
We can't make mistakes, Xiao Tang.

242
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:38,900
Mind your own business.

243
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,820
Xiao Tang and Brother Ye have been playing Glory for a long time.

244
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,400
It seems that they have pretty good teamwork.

245
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:53,200
But Sister Xiao Tang used to play with us.

246
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:56,703
Why does she only play with men now?

247
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:02,941
- Continue. 
 - Watch your position.

248
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,700
The two in front of you.

249
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:15,021
- Xiao Tang. 
 - Speed up.

250
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,800
Xiao Tang?

251
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,900
Guo Guo, wait a minute.

252
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:22,980
Xiao Tang, do a Sky Strike.

253
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:24,900
Okay.

254
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:26,700
Good.

255
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:31,010
- Xiao Tang. 
 - We need to try harder.

256
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:33,860
There's a new cake shop nearby.

257
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:35,960
I heard the cakes are delicious.

258
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:39,520
- Let's go there together. 
 - I'll go if I have time.

259
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:43,740
Watch your back.

260
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:54,700
What's the matter?

261
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:58,900
There are some questions that I don't know.

262
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:01,360
You're the only one who can solve them.

263
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:02,860
Can you teach me?

264
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:05,400
Of course. Why don't you write them down first?

265
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:07,600
I'll solve them for you later.

266
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:11,140
Let's continue.

267
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:27,400
You play every day.

268
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:30,400
Did I hire you to play Glory?

269
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,380
You'd better get to work now.

270
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:36,000
 From now on, you just practice with Xiao Tang 
   

271
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,260
 and improve her skills. That'll be your job. 

272
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:46,720
Hey, go left.

273
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:50,020
You brat, you're playing dirty.

274
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:51,700
Delete.

275
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:53,700
- Don't. It's my phone. 
 - What are you doing?

276
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:55,600
What? Who asked you to record it?

277
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,200
Guo Guo.

278
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,720
Xiao Tang.

279
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:11,000
Let's go and eat something, have fun,

280
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,260
and do something together.

281
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:15,000
It's my treat. Let's go.

282
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,300
All right, stop it. We are now doing the Dungeon.

283
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:19,560
Let's go later. Okay?

284
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:22,080
Back up.

285
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,860
Use your ult. Mind your HP.

286
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:33,180
Heal me.

287
00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:46,240
   

288
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:50,800
Our training's intensity and difficulty are not quite suitable for you.

289
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:53,120
You should go back to the training camp.

290
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:55,560
After improving your skills,

291
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:59,040
you can come back again.

292
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:26,000
 My name is Qiao Yifan. 

293
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,920
 I'm an Assassin in Team Tiny Herb. 

294
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,740
 I am a professional esports player 

295
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:36,300
 who always placed last in the assessments. 

296
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:41,160
 A pro esports player who has never been in a competition before. 

297
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:19,080
   

298
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:24,120
   

299
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:27,456
Come on. Two, three.

300
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,480
   

301
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:44,420
Yingjie, come here and take photos with us.

302
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:45,800
Come on, come on.

303
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:49,140
   

304
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:52,720
Yingjie, Yifan went to the training school.

305
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:53,940
It probably will be very difficult for him to come back.

306
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:55,540
Leave this spot to us.

307
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:56,580
Get out of the way, all of you.

308
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:59,920
Let me take a nice-looking photo with the future captain.

309
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:01,300
Come on.

310
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:14,440
Let me knock you out with a brick.

311
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:21,120
Hey, that monster was clearly mine.

312
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:23,120
It belongs to whoever kills it.

313
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:29,880
Everyone, let's take a ten-minute break.

314
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:32,801
The next boss fight with Toya will be a tough one.

315
00:25:32,801 --> 00:25:34,760
Didn't you just say it wasn't difficult?

316
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:37,360
This jungle boss is designed according to the standard of ten people.

317
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:38,720
Indeed it's not difficult.

318
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:42,060
But there are only three of us.

319
00:25:42,060 --> 00:25:43,580
Crap.

320
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:47,020
Lord Grim is doing Toya's pre-task.

321
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:48,800
He's already in the last stage.

322
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:51,140
If everything goes smoothly, he'll achieve another first kill.

323
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:52,800
Is that so?

324
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,240
All the teammates,

325
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:02,500
gather in the training room in ten minutes.

326
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:04,040
It's an emergency training.

327
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:05,360
Your performance in this training

328
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:07,320
will be included in this month's evaluation.

329
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:11,340
If anyone's absent, their score will be zero for the month.

330
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:14,040
Wow! What kind of training is that? It's so extreme.

331
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:15,560
Absence means zero.

332
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:17,121
In this case, if I can perform well,

333
00:26:17,121 --> 00:26:18,540
will I be in the starting line-up?

334
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:20,221
- Let's go. 
 - Let's go train. Let's go.

335
00:26:20,221 --> 00:26:21,920
Let's go, Yingjie.

336
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:51,682
- Hello. 
 - Hello.

337
00:26:53,505 --> 00:26:55,977
Yifan, wait.

338
00:26:55,977 --> 00:26:57,520
- Yingjie. 
 - There's a new opportunity.

339
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:00,080
A new opportunity? What is it?

340
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:01,380
- Let's go. 
 - To where?

341
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:03,424
Hurry up.

342
00:27:03,424 --> 00:27:04,809
- Sorry. 
 - Wait.

343
00:27:04,809 --> 00:27:06,320
This is an activity led by the captain.

344
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:09,180
If you can perform well, then maybe you don't have to go to training camp.

345
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:10,161
- Are you ready? 
 - Yes.

346
00:27:10,161 --> 00:27:11,500
Let's go.

347
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:17,580
- Captain. 
 - Captain.

348
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:20,160
Sit down.

349
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:30,520
- Take a seat. 
 - Yingjie, you go first.

350
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:32,420
I'll find you.

351
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:42,280
We'll start in five minutes.

352
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:44,140
I look forward to seeing your performances.

353
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:46,260
Go to Desolate Lands. We'll siege a guy called Lord Grim.

354
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:47,720
Thank you.

355
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:50,400
 I have to find a computer in five minutes. 

356
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,720
 to make it in time for the assessment. 

357
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:55,080
Stop.

358
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:56,880
What's wrong, Boss?

359
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:00,020
There's an ambush.

360
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:12,501
- Yingjie, you're the commander. Do it. 
  - Roger that. 

361
00:29:12,501 --> 00:29:14,000
Spread out and kill them one by one.

362
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,000
Liu Fei, lock in on their positions.

363
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,321
- Don't lose the targets. 
 - Okay.

364
00:29:16,321 --> 00:29:18,640
- Yebo, be careful of Bao Zi. Don't underestimate him. 
 - Okay.

365
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,120
Xiao Yun, attack hard on Soft Mist.

366
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:22,541
- but watch your HP. 
 - Got it.

367
00:29:22,541 --> 00:29:24,920
   
    

368
00:29:56,430 --> 00:29:58,520
   

369
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:08,580
   

370
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:20,480
Take my brick.

371
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:23,380
Didn't you say you'd use Brick?

372
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:40,720
It's not bad that we died together.

373
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:43,440
You're good, Bao Zi. You got the first blood.

374
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:45,520
Quickly revive to help Xiao Tang.

375
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:47,121
- She's stuck in a fight. 
 - Got it.

376
00:30:47,121 --> 00:30:48,540
No need.

377
00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:08,000
Competing against me in APM?

378
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,120
I don't believe you can be faster than me.

379
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:22,680
Got yourself killed?

380
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:25,020
I told you to wait for Bao Zi.

381
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:30,160
   
   

382
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:50,780
 Lord Grim kept it up for so long without falling behind. 

383
00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:53,880
 I think it's almost impossible to defeat him head-on. 

384
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:56,840
 That's right, Boss Toya. 
   

385
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:00,960
 If they want to fight Toya, 

386
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:03,000
 they must pass through this cave. 

387
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:06,040
 The terrain here is complicated and is suitable for an ambush. 

388
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:25,930
   

389
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:28,580
Shadow Clone.

390
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:36,040
Yingjie, watch your back.

391
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:52,360
   

392
00:32:56,100 --> 00:33:00,360
Failure, is what I expected.

393
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:04,400
But I didn't expect you'd lose so fast.

394
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:19,000
Xiao Yun, rashness is your greatest enemy.

395
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:22,380
The match is never about who starts first wins.

396
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:24,060
Understood.

397
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:26,680
Liu Fei,

398
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:29,800
it's good to care about your teammates.

399
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:32,520
But whenever a teammate is in danger,

400
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:34,780
you'll lose your correct judgment of the whole situation.

401
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:37,560
This is the main problem you need to overcome at present.

402
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:39,560
Understood, Captain

403
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:41,380
Yebo.

404
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:44,280
Captain, I'll practice my low-level account well.

405
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:46,560
I'll find that Lord Grim again tonight and take revenge.

406
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:49,200
You think the reason why you failed today

407
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:51,260
is because you used low-level accounts?

408
00:33:51,260 --> 00:33:52,740
I...

409
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:56,500
You all think like that, right?

410
00:33:57,400 --> 00:34:00,060
You're all official members of a champion team.

411
00:34:00,060 --> 00:34:04,820
Yet you have to siege an ordinary player in a dungeon.

412
00:34:04,820 --> 00:34:08,760
It's not worth your efforts at all. Right?

413
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:12,301
Yingjie, what did you think of Lord Grim's skills?

414
00:34:12,301 --> 00:34:13,440
He's very good.

415
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:14,560
How good is he?

416
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:18,240
He's very experienced. His attacks and skills are used effectively.

417
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:21,460
All his judgments are accurate.

418
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:23,680
He is better than all of us.

419
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:26,200
Yes, better than all of you.

420
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:28,560
He's great enough to kill all of you.

421
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:32,120
So, never underestimate any opponent.

422
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:33,960
Today is a good lesson for you all.

423
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:37,361
When you go back, take a good look at the video of the match.

424
00:34:37,361 --> 00:34:41,360
I hope you'll learn something.

425
00:34:42,140 --> 00:34:44,880
Who exactly is this Lord Grim?

426
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:53,200
What you've encountered today is the greatest Boss in the history of Glory.

427
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:00,860
Ye Qiu.

428
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:03,260
- Ye Qiu? 
 - Ye Qiu?

429
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:04,960
Look!

430
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:21,740
Interesting.

431
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:23,520
Hang in there, Yifan.

432
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,400
Ask him to stop.

433
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:28,800
I'll go and get him.

434
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:35,000
You've got ideas, but unfortunately, you didn't realize your problem.

435
00:36:37,340 --> 00:36:39,460
And what's that?

436
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:46,200
- He's a grandmaster indeed. 
 - It's so hot.

437
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:47,580
- His play style is so cool. 
 - What are you doing?

438
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:49,900
It's today's training video.

439
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:51,480
Isn't it the part where Yingjie lost?

440
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:52,680
- Yeah. 
 - Yes, this is it.

441
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:54,300
It was a terrible loss, wasn't it?

442
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:55,580
Do you know what this is?

443
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:57,080
It's called Shadow Clone.

444
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:58,860
- Yebo. 
 - Let's watch it again.

445
00:36:58,860 --> 00:37:00,260
Yebo.

446
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:02,440
Where is the captain?

447
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:04,000
Where is the captain?

448
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,320
I think he's gone.

449
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:07,500
Actually, it's nothing.

450
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:09,240
Captain's worried you'll be too embarrassed from losing.

451
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:11,040
After all, your opponent is the grandmaster, Ye Qiu.

452
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,150
- This is it. 
 - Ye Qiu?

453
00:37:12,150 --> 00:37:13,660
Lord Grim is Grandmaster Ye Qiu?

454
00:37:13,661 --> 00:37:15,480
- He's a grandmaster indeed. 
 - Right.

455
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:17,480
Yeah. When do you think I can be like him?

456
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:19,260
Just keep practicing.

457
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:23,400
There's no more water? Yifan.

458
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:25,420
If you've got nothing to do, can you get me some water?

459
00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:26,560
Thank you.

460
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:28,960
Me too, Yifan.

461
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,820
- Look at you, Liu Fei. 
 - Look at you instead.

462
00:37:30,820 --> 00:37:32,360
Look, you lost first.

463
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:36,180
Don't look at me. I didn't perform well today.

464
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:38,840
I'm not usually like this.

465
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:43,080
Actually, I think it would benefit Yifan to go to the Glory Bootcamp.

466
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:44,400
If he stays on our team,

467
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:47,620
he will always be the water boy. That's even worse.

468
00:37:47,620 --> 00:37:49,460
Let's keep watching.

469
00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:51,400
This loss is even worse.

470
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:52,340
Let's work hard.

471
00:37:52,340 --> 00:37:55,080
Liu Fei. Yebo. Here you are.

472
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:56,960
- Thank you. 
 - Thank you.

473
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:59,080
Look at this execution. Isn't it cool?

474
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:02,000
That's pretty cool. Isn't that you?

475
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,380
Impressive.

476
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:07,920
But speaking of, so what if he's impressive?

477
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:09,360
Is he any better than our Tiny Herb?

478
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:10,880
Exactly.

479
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:12,480
By the way, Yingjie,

480
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:17,480
I heard that the restaurant we always go to is getting renovated.

481
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:21,080
We may not be able to eat their takeout for a while.

482
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:24,600
So you'll also have to eat my portion while I'm gone.

483
00:38:26,158 --> 00:38:30,940
♫  But with you, I have limitless strength  ♫

00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:32,720
What's with that expression?

485
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:36,360
I'm just going to train for a few days. I will come back.

486
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:39,400
Come back soon.

487
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:40,840
Of course.

488
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:44,720
When I come back, you must defeat that Lord Grim.

489
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:51,040
I heard them say that the captain intends to train you to be his successor.

490
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:56,080
Yingjie, keep it up.

491
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:58,960
You too. You've got this.

492
00:38:58,960 --> 00:38:59,894
I'm leaving.

 Actually, I think it would benefit Yifan to go to the Glory Bootcamp. 

499
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:30,510
 If he stays on our team, 

500
00:39:30,510 --> 00:39:33,680
 he will always be the water boy. That's even worse.
