 "Light From the Ashes" - Cai Wei Ze 

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:06,170
♫  Countless fireflies born from insignificance  ♫

3
00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:10,080
♫  Riding the long wind to gather into a shining galaxy  ♫

4
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:13,980
♫  Proclaim to the world on top of the sky  ♫

5
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:18,520
♫  We will return in glory  ♫

6
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:23,720
♫  Clear the clouds and descend with the heat  ♫

7
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:27,300
♫  Melting ice and snow, overcoming twists and turns  ♫

8
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:31,120
♫  Finally at this moment of peak  ♫

9
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:35,240
♫  There is a figure that coincides with the past  ♫

10
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:39,090
♫  The glory of the past that never came  ♫

11
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:42,610
♫  The pride that the future will never pass  ♫

12
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:46,450
♫  Our fingertips intertwined and condensed  ♫

13
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:50,440
♫  Into a song that ignited the battlefield  ♫

14
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:54,190
♫  The only light in an endless night  ♫

15
00:00:54,190 --> 00:00:58,070
♫  Is you and me who overcame mediocrity  ♫

16
00:00:58,070 --> 00:01:01,850
♫  Up on the clouds and down in the dust  ♫

17
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:05,580
♫  Fireflies making every effort to illuminate  ♫

18
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:09,530
♫  I came from the legend to carry on a legend  ♫

19
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:13,430
♫  Once it's disruptive, a decade of persistence won't be in vain  ♫

20
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:17,360
♫  Up on the clouds and down in the dust  ♫

21
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:21,150
♫  Fireflies making every effort to illuminate  ♫

22
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:24,750
♫  Fireflies making every effort to illuminate  ♫

23
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:28,100
   

24
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:32,800
   

25
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:38,540
Just an ordinary internet café can be boosted into becoming a team.

26
00:01:48,028 --> 00:01:50,680
They dare to place this in front of Excellent Era.

27
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:53,600
The boss has a lot of guts

28
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,540
What era is this now?

29
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:58,820
Does this guy still even have fans?

30
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,820
I'm his fan.

31
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:13,580
Also the owner of this internet cafe.

32
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:15,080
Is there a problem?

33
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,720
Young lady,

34
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:21,480
what are you thinking?

35
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:24,040
Being a fan of Ye Qiu.

36
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:27,300
What do you mean?

37
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:32,560
In all of Glory is there anyone more tragic than Ye Qiu's fans?

38
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,994
No one can find him after competition.

39
00:02:34,994 --> 00:02:38,117
He's got no resources. No popularity. Everyone admits it?

40
00:02:38,117 --> 00:02:40,320
But why did he suddenly retire?

41
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:42,320
Now he's vanished.

42
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:45,260
His fans can't even put up a posters.

43
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:47,400
They've been his fans for more than a half of their youth,

44
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:50,240
and their idol has never made an appearance.

45
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:54,940
A player of Glory is never free.

46
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:59,640
Ye Qiu, when will you come back?

47
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:06,740
Don't be ao sad.

48
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:11,340
It has been ten years. It hasn't been easy for any of us.

49
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:15,640
But Ye Qiu will definitely come back.

50
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,720
I promise you.

51
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,300
Could it be said that you know that Ye Qiu has formed a team?

52
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,640
I'm the boss of this team.

53
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:31,300
That means your boss has stayed in the E-sports circle all these years.

54
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:32,720
And it's the Glory circle.

55
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:33,665
That's right.

56
00:03:33,665 --> 00:03:36,708
He said himself that all his skills for making a living are in the Glory.

57
00:03:36,708 --> 00:03:39,640
Without the Glory, 90% of him would be a good-for-nothing.

58
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:43,180
I just knew it.

59
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:46,280
What about the remaining 10%?

60
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,360
It's his face.

61
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,048
He said his face is equal to hard currency.

62
00:03:49,048 --> 00:03:51,711
It would be easy for him to live a good life just with his face.

63
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,420
Pretend I never asked.

64
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:04,068
Hey, man. Be careful!

65
00:04:04,068 --> 00:04:07,554
This is the treasure of our boss.

66
00:04:07,554 --> 00:04:09,750
Sorry. Sorry.

67
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:14,020
This...is it silver equipment?

68
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:15,780
It's a wand that reached level 60.

69
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:18,328
AD 530. AP 777.

70
00:04:18,328 --> 00:04:20,162
This is a top-level silver equipment made by our boss for years,

71
00:04:20,162 --> 00:04:23,900
specially designed for Warlock.

72
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:27,140
Warlock?

73
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:28,320
Is he still playing Warlock?

74
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:32,440
Yes. Since his beginning in Glory, he has always been playing Warlock.

75
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:46,920
Making a silver equipment in such conditions, that's something.

76
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:49,180
Our boss is stubborn.

77
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:51,682
You know, the price of silver equipment has been driven up.

78
00:04:51,682 --> 00:04:53,740
But he would never sell it.

79
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,480
That's right.

80
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:59,080
He would neither play a game, nor join a team.

81
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:02,900
Why did he make this top-level silver equipment?

82
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:04,840
That's right.

83
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:06,820
So such effort.

84
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:09,320
What is it for?

85
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:11,900
You must be a rich second-generation.

86
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:15,942
- I'm not. 
 - Then you must have some connection with the league.

87
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:20,180
What do you mean?

88
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:22,108
No. I don't mean that.

89
00:05:22,108 --> 00:05:25,669
What I'm saying is, as a fan of Ye Qiu, I'm a tragic figure myself.

90
00:05:25,669 --> 00:05:27,380
You're the boss of this team.

91
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:30,900
You must have either software or hardware, right?

92
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:33,800
I do.

93
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:37,880
I have this internet café,

94
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:42,360
and a group of people who follow Ye Qiu.

95
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:44,500
How many people are they?

96
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,577
With myself included, there are eight.

97
00:05:47,577 --> 00:05:49,462
Where are they from?

98
00:05:49,462 --> 00:05:50,757
All were recruited from Glory.

99
00:05:50,757 --> 00:05:54,174
Although they're all new faces, they all have great potential.

100
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,080
Even worse than a poorly-equipped troupe.

101
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,565
- No wonder they would cheat me. 
 - What?

102
00:06:00,565 --> 00:06:03,420
I mean you really have a good sense.

103
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:05,700
Team Happy must have a bright future.

104
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:08,000
Are you short of player in Dungeon?

105
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,020
Why don't you tell me the online coordinates?

106
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:11,780
My team can help you attack.

107
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:13,760
Online coordinates?

108
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:16,360
He went to search for it himself?

109
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:18,580
It's not easy to be a bounty hunter.

110
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:20,560
Besides, this is a big order.

111
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:23,000
KPI of the whole year depends on it.

112
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,900
Surely he'd do it by himself.

113
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:27,860
Really?

114
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,260
What kind of order it is?

115
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,520
Come with me.

116
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:45,380
Look. Here it is.

117
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:51,600
Our mission. Kill Lord Grim.

118
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,348
We're not lacking players for Glory.

119
00:06:57,348 --> 00:07:01,037
But I know. It's not easy for you to come here from afar.

120
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:03,720
I still have one.

121
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:07,840
So here you are.

122
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:14,282
What's this?

123
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,660
Signature of Ye Qiu.

124
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:21,640
Don't tell other fans.

125
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:24,120
Boss! Time for our meeting!

126
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,440
Coming.

127
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,430
Excuse me.

128
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:51,377
Task for this week is to attack the following maps.

129
00:07:51,377 --> 00:07:53,931
The coordinates of the next Dungeon is...

130
00:07:57,691 --> 00:07:58,848
Just passing by.

131
00:07:58,848 --> 00:08:00,391
Passing by.

132
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:07,280
Let's continue.

133
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,260
Here you are, boss.

134
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:11,540
Step aside.

135
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:15,660
Boss. The online coordinates of Lord Grim.

136
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:17,542
Don't even mention it.

137
00:08:17,542 --> 00:08:21,005
That woman's mouth is as closed as a burglar-proof padlock.

138
00:08:21,005 --> 00:08:26,000
No matter what I asked, nothing of Lord Grim's whereabouts was revealed.

139
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:28,760
She's so alert.

140
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:31,268
It's reasonable that you can't find out.

141
00:08:31,268 --> 00:08:34,162
Boss. We've found it.

142
00:08:34,162 --> 00:08:36,114
- What? 
 - At 4 p.m..

143
00:08:36,114 --> 00:08:37,920
In Zone A of Miluo Ancient City.

144
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:41,351
- That's right. 
 - The coordinate is 3958 2564.

145
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:44,140
You guys are amazing!

146
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:45,400
Thanks to boss's good leadership.

147
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,697
That's right. Boss is excellent!

148
00:08:46,697 --> 00:08:47,820
Let's have a meeting.

149
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:52,782
Our mission this time is to thoroughly intercept and kill Lord Grim in Glory.

150
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:55,540
The reward is priced at 500.

151
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:57,620
No upper limit of attack.

152
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:00,060
Do you know what it means?

153
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:07,780
The set up in Glory is that after 5 kills, you decrease one level.

154
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:11,377
Then cut a level-70 player down to level zero.

155
00:09:11,377 --> 00:09:15,074
The amount that accrues will be ¥175,000.

156
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:21,880
If the Cleric brought him back to life, the profit will be doubled.

157
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:25,120
That is ¥350,000.

158
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,600
¥350,000!

159
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:32,920
That high...is the Heavenly Domain.

160
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:35,180
If we chase him into a common area and kill again,

161
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:36,840
we'll gain ¥700,000.

162
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:39,248
¥700,000!

163
00:09:39,248 --> 00:09:40,402
Understand?

164
00:09:40,402 --> 00:09:41,577
Yes.

165
00:09:41,577 --> 00:09:44,837
Finish this mission and we'll have our year-end bonus.

166
00:09:44,837 --> 00:09:46,171
What do you think?

167
00:09:46,171 --> 00:09:47,577
Want to give it a try?

168
00:09:47,577 --> 00:09:49,520
Yes!

169
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:52,308
Boss! Boss! Lord Grim is online now.

170
00:09:52,308 --> 00:09:53,520
How many people are they?

171
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:55,380
Just him alone.

172
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:57,720
Buddies.

173
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,508
Here comes our God of Wealth.

174
00:09:59,508 --> 00:10:01,108
Let's welcome our guest!

175
00:10:01,108 --> 00:10:02,957
All right!

176
00:10:27,531 --> 00:10:29,345
Team two, lift-off. Team one, get ready for targeted fire.

177
00:10:29,345 --> 00:10:30,820
Roger that.

178
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:12,100
   

179
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:20,010
Double hack, 2 stage flow.

180
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:23,740
Oh my! How many transformations does this umbrella have?

181
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:26,168
His play is still so awesome.

182
00:11:26,168 --> 00:11:27,611
Everyone set out in batches!

183
00:11:27,611 --> 00:11:29,520
Wear out his patience.

184
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:45,754
Half of our team has been killed.

185
00:11:45,754 --> 00:11:47,720
Why aren't you attacking, boss?

186
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,300
Wait a minute.

187
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:28,080
It's right now!

188
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,800
   

189
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:48,360
We've got Lord Grim!

190
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,814
Boss! Bravo, boss!

191
00:12:49,814 --> 00:12:51,500
That ¥700,000 is ours!

192
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:53,800
Finally captured that crafty guy.

193
00:12:54,725 --> 00:12:57,465
People who sacrified themselves today will get a red packet!

194
00:12:57,465 --> 00:12:59,580
Especially those who got Lord Grim's online coordinates.

195
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:01,174
You deserve a good reward!

196
00:13:01,174 --> 00:13:02,034
Thanks, boss.

197
00:13:02,034 --> 00:13:04,155
What I want to say is our boss has a wide connections.

198
00:13:04,155 --> 00:13:06,474
Unless your friend hadn't helped us find the online  coordinates,

199
00:13:06,474 --> 00:13:08,254
- We...
 - Wait a moment.

200
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:11,040
My friend?

201
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,220
What friend?

202
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:14,340
A man came here this afternoon.

203
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:16,120
He said he's your friend.

204
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,840
Oh, no!

205
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:30,080
That's a substitute!

206
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,280
My friend.

207
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:33,180
Long time no see.

208
00:13:36,125 --> 00:13:38,205
You scoundrel! You set me up!

209
00:13:38,205 --> 00:13:39,851
How can you call that a set up?

210
00:13:39,851 --> 00:13:41,371
I know you're suffering from all those investigations.

211
00:13:41,371 --> 00:13:43,094
So I deliberately sent you some information.

212
00:13:43,094 --> 00:13:45,371
What? I helped you so much.

213
00:13:45,371 --> 00:13:47,300
You complain about your own failure to catch me.

214
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:49,900
Cut this nonsense! Release me!

215
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:52,180
Then lie down and let us collect the money!

216
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:53,531
Then I'll let everything go.

217
00:13:53,531 --> 00:13:55,120
Otherwise...

218
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:59,180
Old Wei. You even got some silver equipment.

219
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:01,748
It seems that your conditions are becoming better. Let me have a look.

220
00:14:01,748 --> 00:14:04,114
I warn you. Don't even think about those weapons.

221
00:14:04,114 --> 00:14:06,740
Or else I'll go after you forever.

222
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:08,320
Go kill him, buddies!

223
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,754
He doesn't have a lot of blood. Let's defeat him!

224
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:16,420
   

225
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:19,420
This is the benefit of teamwork.

226
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:21,960
You're here alone with little blood.

227
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:25,040
Just wait for the mass brawl and being defeated!

228
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:40,120
Who told you that I'm alone?

229
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,511
Go! It's your turn.

230
00:14:41,511 --> 00:14:42,854
Roger that.

231
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:52,182
This is the helper that you called again and again?

232
00:14:52,182 --> 00:14:55,402
A Ghost for support? Like a piece of cake.

233
00:14:55,402 --> 00:14:57,897
To fight you, it's enough.

234
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:04,660
Do you see the old rascal in front of you?

235
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:05,528
Don't be soft-hearted.

236
00:15:05,528 --> 00:15:06,488
Go decidedly!

237
00:15:06,488 --> 00:15:07,880
Got it!

238
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,720
Slow down.

239
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,428
You sound so young.

240
00:15:16,428 --> 00:15:18,860
Why are you so vicious?

241
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:20,080
Sorry.

242
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:23,214
Hey, bro. Good skills!

243
00:15:23,214 --> 00:15:24,900
Look at your operation and mentality.

244
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:26,820
You don't seem like a player of Glory.

245
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:28,080
Are you a professional?

246
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,200
From which team?

247
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:31,120
Team Tiny Herb.

248
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,960
Team Tiny Herb's a good team.

249
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:35,440
I have a good relationship with Wang Jiexi.

250
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:38,340
Later I'll tell him to let you play in the starting line up.

251
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:41,460
You're good. But just lack opportunity.

252
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,540
Senior. Sorry.

253
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:49,954
But I probably won't need it.

254
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:52,982
Wrong. You need it.

255
00:15:52,982 --> 00:15:54,955
Young lad. This is your time.

256
00:15:54,955 --> 00:15:56,559
Don't be shy. Don't resist.

257
00:15:56,559 --> 00:15:57,702
Get ready for the battle!

258
00:15:57,702 --> 00:15:59,800
Zhou Yebo.

259
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:01,900
You got the wrong person.

260
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:18,620
You're something.

261
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:20,500
Still scamming when you're facing imminent disaster.

262
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,774
The one you searched up is not him.

263
00:16:22,774 --> 00:16:23,634
He's my teammate.

264
00:16:23,634 --> 00:16:25,485
Why did you search Team Tiny Herb?

265
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:26,980
Whoa. You're unreliable.

266
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:29,505
Where can I find information on your pitiful team?

267
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:33,940
That wand looks disgusting.

268
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:36,440
What kind of aesthetics does its owner have?

269
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:37,800
Cry now. Old Wei.

270
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,860
Your baby wand is mine now.

271
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:42,255
You scum! Give my silver weapon back right now!

272
00:16:42,255 --> 00:16:45,540
Boss. Their computers are off-line.

273
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:56,280
Ye Qiu! You scoundrel!

274
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:58,040
We'll see!

275
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:10,120
   

276
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:23,000
- Boss. 
 - Boss.

277
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:41,040
 [One Autumn Leaf 

278
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:47,120
Boss, have a seat.

279
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:53,280
Clear the site.

280
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,065
Yes, sir.

281
00:17:54,065 --> 00:17:56,400
Clear the people.

282
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,400
Or do you want to book the whole café?

283
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:06,151
I want Ye Qiu to come out and see me.

284
00:18:06,151 --> 00:18:08,520
Booking this cafe doesn't have anything to do with me.

285
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:10,560
You can talk to me directly.

286
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:19,140
Are you qualified to discuss it with me?

287
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:24,120
I think,

288
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:28,040
you look a little familiar.

289
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:31,580
It's not important who I am.

290
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:35,900
But what I've lost, I must personally take back.

291
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:39,200
People who pretend to be Brother Xiaoma here

292
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:42,180
will at least bring a toothpick.

293
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:46,317
Here.

294
00:18:46,317 --> 00:18:47,800
It's for you.

295
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:58,120
Your label is sticking out.

296
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:02,820
Stop pretending.

297
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:05,000
Little fan.

298
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,120
Who's that?

299
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:07,920
With an array of some many people.

300
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:13,620
Give Death's Hand back to me right now!

301
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:18,460
Or I have a hundred ways to make you miserable!

302
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:20,000
A hundred?

303
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,880
You're creative.

304
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:27,200
I've wandered around the world, been known to be heartless and cruel.

305
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,380
My buddies stand here today.

306
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:31,440
I promise you that within a few days,

307
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:34,625
this café will have to close.

308
00:19:34,625 --> 00:19:35,977
Not long ago, boss was saying that

309
00:19:35,977 --> 00:19:37,880
that we needed to hire several people to help out in the cafe.

310
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:39,120
That's a good thing.

311
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,800
We can save on salaries.

312
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,551
Old friend.

313
00:19:45,551 --> 00:19:48,562
You know how much painstaking effort it took for me to create this weapon?

314
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:50,228
Thousands of nights.

315
00:19:50,228 --> 00:19:52,054
Dozens of versions modified.

316
00:19:52,054 --> 00:19:54,440
Finally I got this top silver weapon.

317
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:56,000
I'm not bragging about it.

318
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,600
Out of all the warlocks in the whole professional circle.

319
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:00,380
I dare to say

320
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:02,200
that I'm second to none.

321
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:04,840
You must be lonely.

322
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:06,431
Old Wei.

323
00:20:06,431 --> 00:20:09,740
What an effort it was to create this silver weapon!

324
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:12,034
it would be a waste to fight common players.

325
00:20:12,034 --> 00:20:14,080
Unless you want to come back to the competition.

326
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,180
Save your nonsense. Speak clearly.

327
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:19,020
What would it take for you to return the Death Hand?

328
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:20,860
It's rather simple.

329
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:23,000
Substitute in a Tutor Selection match for Team Happy.

330
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,620
If we win, I'll give it back to you.

331
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:28,600
I just knew it.

332
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:31,000
You want me to help.

333
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,900
This poor troupe can't work, right?

334
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:36,420
I have a big company.

335
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:40,077
Just lifting my hand means tens of millions in business.

336
00:20:40,077 --> 00:20:42,960
How would I have time to mess around here with you?

337
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:45,780
Then...

338
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:49,060
I won't see you out.

339
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:56,300
Listen.

340
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:58,751
Boss has already decided to refashion that wand.

341
00:20:58,751 --> 00:21:01,960
For my usage. I'll have a silver weapon from now on.

342
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:02,868
Hey, Bao Zi.

343
00:21:02,868 --> 00:21:05,180
That silver weapon can't be used by you alone.

344
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:06,617
- What? 
 -  Shut up now.

345
00:21:06,617 --> 00:21:08,760
Let me introduce this silver weapon to you.

346
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:11,754
In terms of INT, Magic Strike,

347
00:21:11,754 --> 00:21:13,917
Personal Attribute Bonus,

348
00:21:13,917 --> 00:21:15,177
and Magic Singing

349
00:21:15,177 --> 00:21:16,448
this silver weapon is almost perfect.

350
00:21:16,448 --> 00:21:19,440
It's one of the best silver equipment weapons I've ever seen.

351
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,040
If we can dismantle it,

352
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:24,900
Its INT material can be used to update Xiao Tang's Lance.

353
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:27,262
Its Magic Singing can transform into attack speed for Bao Zi.

354
00:21:27,262 --> 00:21:28,450
And Xiao An can have its Magic Strike.

355
00:21:28,450 --> 00:21:30,494
- That's great! 
 - If we do that, we can form an explosive team in the future.

356
00:21:30,494 --> 00:21:32,550
There should be no problem with that.

357
00:21:33,111 --> 00:21:35,400
Now, when you are dismantling it, you must be very careful.

358
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,920
If we were to fail,

359
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,360
that silver weapon would be completely ruined.

360
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:40,200
We won't lose anything.

361
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,285
We don't need that wand after all.

362
00:21:42,285 --> 00:21:43,580
Just tear it apart.

363
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:45,380
It's good that the owner of this weapon is not here.

364
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:46,540
If he was here,

365
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:49,114
standing and watching his equipment get dismantled...

366
00:21:49,114 --> 00:21:51,580
how cruel that would be!

367
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:53,428
That's heartrending.

368
00:21:58,134 --> 00:21:59,782
Deal.

369
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:05,340
Wishing us a fruitful collaboration.

370
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:11,600
   
   

371
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:14,260
You can leave now, buddies.

372
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:15,360
I have to stay here.

373
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:16,800
Boss.

374
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:19,500
Don't worry.

375
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:20,860
Don't feel bad.

376
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:23,780
I'll be back as soon as I get my Death's Hand back.

377
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:25,200
Boss.

378
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,280
I mean...

379
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:28,680
It's near the return deadline for our suits.

380
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:39,080
Put it back on.

381
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:40,577
Goodbye, boss.

382
00:22:40,577 --> 00:22:42,060
Let's go, guys. Go. Come on, let's go.

383
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:43,900
Back to the company.

384
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:53,060
The master says that we're going to use a containment strategy this time.

385
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:56,120
What is containment?

386
00:22:56,120 --> 00:23:00,834
Containment is a representative tactic of Team Blue Rain in ancient times.

387
00:23:01,828 --> 00:23:02,990
Containment means that

388
00:23:02,990 --> 00:23:05,820
without conflict with the opposite side, you can keep harassing them.

389
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:08,017
Without even making anyone panic

390
00:23:08,017 --> 00:23:10,660
it can help you achieve your goal.

391
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:15,340
Look. This is the 'containment' I found when I searched online.

392
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:16,800
It's Tom and Jerry.

393
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:19,714
This old tactic is from centuries ago.

394
00:23:19,714 --> 00:23:22,000
It's out of date.

395
00:23:23,563 --> 00:23:25,554
Tom and Jerry is a classic animation

396
00:23:25,554 --> 00:23:28,614
produced by MGM in 1939.

397
00:23:28,614 --> 00:23:32,568
It is a bit old. But which one of us has grown up without it?

398
00:23:32,568 --> 00:23:34,360
Containment?

399
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:36,260
Have you guys heard it before?

400
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:41,400
Containment has never been old-fashioned.

401
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:43,660
Only iof you're not good at it.

402
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:45,300
If you can do it well,

403
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:47,100
it is a classic.

404
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:49,580
Today I will let you see

405
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:52,800
what is genuine 'containment'.

406
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:57,000
Pick a map that you have the highest chance of winning.

407
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,600
Or else you'll find excuses, if you lose.

408
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:06,700
Then we choose the Tower.

409
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:08,700
Our win rate is 87.6%.

410
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:10,280
What do you think?

411
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:12,900
You want to beat me with such a low rate?

412
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:14,100
Except the map,

413
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:16,440
I'll give you one more right. You decide the rules of this game.

414
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:18,260
Then we climb the Tower.

415
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:19,942
The one who gets to the top of the Tower is the winner.

416
00:24:19,942 --> 00:24:21,460
Let's do it.

417
00:24:32,714 --> 00:24:36,511
Three. Two. One. Begin.

418
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:56,322
Bao Zi. Help me check and find out which route he's taking.

419
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,000
He hasn't moved at all.

420
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,820
How come?

421
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:05,280
It seems that containment is not a big deal.

422
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:07,480
The first principle of containment

423
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:11,360
is to keep calm no matter what happens.

424
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:14,725
You can't even climb. Stop this stuff about keeping calm.

425
00:25:14,725 --> 00:25:19,260
No matter how fast you climb, you're just my stepping-stone.

426
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:41,800
You...

427
00:26:16,851 --> 00:26:19,302
- What a dirty trick! 
 - The second principle of containment

428
00:26:19,302 --> 00:26:23,211
is to gain mastery by striking only after the enemy has struck.

429
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:37,517
One Inch Ash.

430
00:26:37,517 --> 00:26:39,940
Your reaction and mental acuity are not too bad.

431
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:41,160
Thanks, senior.

432
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:44,720
So do you know the 36 frequently-used combos of Ghostblade?

433
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:48,180
What 36 combos?

434
00:26:58,277 --> 00:27:01,654
You've gone to far! Kill him when the game is almost finished. That's foul.

435
00:27:01,654 --> 00:27:04,900
The third principle of containment is to play hard.

436
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:07,600
That's the best way of playing games.

437
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:11,080
I'm so kind that I'll give you one last lesson.

438
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:12,780
The so-called 'containment'

439
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:14,840
is to play not by the conventional wisdom.

440
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:19,188
The essence of it is be the best opportunist.

441
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:27,180
Let's play again.

442
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:31,400
Young players are eager to win.

443
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:32,900
That's good.

444
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:34,700
However,

445
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:36,397
that'll be all for today.

446
00:27:36,397 --> 00:27:38,922
I've got something else to do. Got to go.

447
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:43,300
How are their preparations going?

448
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:45,000
Not bad.

449
00:27:46,908 --> 00:27:48,900
Then next, I'll start to prepare for

450
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:51,800
- the Challenge. 
 - You guys busy now?

451
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:58,300
No problem. Just do it.

452
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:02,460
By the way, have we got enough money?

453
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:05,200
What are you looking at?

454
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:10,268
Don't worry about money. I'll handle it.

455
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:18,200
I want to see you smiling at me.

456
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:20,900
The coffee tastes so bitter.

457
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:24,980
But you smile, is my sugar.

458
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:27,020
He who touches rouge will be stained with red,

459
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:30,220
but he who gets in contact with you will feel sweet.

460
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,234
This woman is easy to deal with.

461
00:28:49,234 --> 00:28:50,700
I didn't even try my best and

462
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:52,900
she just left.

463
00:28:55,420 --> 00:28:58,191
What do you want to say that can't be said in front of the boss?

464
00:28:58,191 --> 00:29:00,605
These young players, they really can't make it.

465
00:29:00,605 --> 00:29:03,911
No matter how I teach, they can't learn it well.

466
00:29:03,911 --> 00:29:05,720
Is it because they don't understand your lessons?

467
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:08,020
Or they won't admit it to you?

468
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:10,200
In a word, don't count on them.

469
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:11,800
Just give up.

470
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:13,800
Things like competition,

471
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:16,440
still depend on us in the older generation.

472
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:18,360
I'm not part of that group.

473
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:21,280
When you say the word "old", don't include me.

474
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:24,020
I'm serious.

475
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:27,251
Playing in competitions needs players like you and me.

476
00:29:27,251 --> 00:29:30,300
We have both competence and experience.

477
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:32,600
My Death's Hand

478
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:35,800
is the key to success.

479
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:39,620
You must give it back to me. Or else we'll definitely lose.

480
00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:42,280
You want to get it back so eagerly.

481
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:45,020
Who are you going to fight?

482
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:48,600
I'm invincible.

483
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:51,060
Do I look like someone has any rival?

484
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:55,020
In today's Glory League,

485
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:58,080
is there no player that you regard as a rival?

486
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,900
No matter who he is,

487
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:07,300
if he fights with me, it's all the same.

488
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:09,180
I'll hit him hard.

489
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:12,700
Whoa. There's no sugar in my coffee too.

490
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:15,900
Lao Wei. Give me a smile.

491
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:31,380
Here, Bao Zi, take this.

492
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:37,960
Not until now have I realized

493
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:40,200
what the words, "Return of the King" mean.

494
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:43,000
And how intimidating it is!

495
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,880
Don't lag behind, King.

496
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,842
I'm afraid you won't even be able to find the door when you get to the stadium.

497
00:30:46,842 --> 00:30:48,900
We're going to fight Team Blue Rain. Are you afraid?

498
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:51,000
Team Blue Rain?

499
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:54,200
What do you mean?

500
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:56,860
Why didn't you tell me earlier that we'll be fighting Team Blue Rain?

501
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:00,600
I just knew you were a scoundrel.

502
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:02,620
You lie to me so that I will fight Team Blue Rain for you.

503
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:04,360
Master?

504
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
Why are you here?

505
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:18,080
Master!

506
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:19,600
Where have you been for such a long time?

507
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:21,100
Do you know how long we've been looking for you?

508
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:22,982
You should at least tell us now that you have retired.

509
00:31:22,982 --> 00:31:25,920
Don't you miss our team? Don't you miss me?

510
00:31:27,377 --> 00:31:29,908
I won't let you go this time! I finally found you.

511
00:31:29,908 --> 00:31:31,297
Do you know how much I miss you?

512
00:31:31,297 --> 00:31:35,020
I even wrote a song for you. It's called, "In the World only the Captain's Dear".

513
00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:43,040
You little jerk. After just a few years, you've become so heavy.

514
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:44,680
Captain Wei.

515
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:58,400
Long time no see.

516
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:00,800
You're here too.

517
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:03,840
Old Wei. Time to go in.

518
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:08,200
I'll go bananas right here, right now!

519
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:19,620
Come here! Don't go there! What are you doing?

520
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:22,720
Old Wei says, see you soon.

521
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:32,540
See you around.

522
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:41,460
Ye Qiu, you're so shameless that you even lied to me!

523
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:45,180
Blue Rain is not easy to defeat.

524
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:58,500
Come on.

525
00:33:00,682 --> 00:33:04,740
Give me Death's Hand. Right now, immediately!

526
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:09,300
Death's Hand, weighs 3kg, attack speed 2.

527
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:13,600
No matter how I observe,

528
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:17,700
this weapon seems to have been designed for Yu Wenzhou.

529
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:19,600
Am I right?

530
00:33:24,070 --> 00:33:26,400
   

531
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:27,800
Where's my weapon?

532
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:30,320
The competition is about to start.

533
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:32,560
Here you are.

534
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:35,080
   

535
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:38,100
What can I do with a chicken claw?

536
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:39,500
Where's my Death's Hand?

537
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:41,300
Give it to me!

538
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:44,380
I promised it would be returned after winning this game.

539
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,500
Why should I waste my time here if you don't give it back?

540
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:49,800
Giving you face or for your moral character?

541
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:51,900
In your mind, aren't you clear?

542
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:53,540
I'm a retired old player.

543
00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:56,120
I'm going to fight the leader of Team Blue Rain with a primary weapon?

544
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:58,460
Am I mad?

545
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,900
Without my silver weapon,

546
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:02,820
I won't help you fight.

547
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:06,960
What I asked for help is you, not your weapon.

548
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,940
Don't lie anymore.

549
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:11,960
In a word, will you give it back to me?

550
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:17,020
Last round of Tutor Selection.

551
00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:18,568
Team Happy vs. Team Blue Rain.

552
00:34:18,568 --> 00:34:20,700
is about to start!

553
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:23,380
- This is a life or death battle for Team Happy. 
 - Okay.

554
00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:26,486
You're the one who's going to let me die. Don't regret it.

555
00:34:26,486 --> 00:34:28,825
This means that if Team Happy wants to be promoted,

556
00:34:28,825 --> 00:34:30,780
all of their teammates have to survive.

557
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:32,802
Facing Master Technician Yu Wenzhou

558
00:34:32,802 --> 00:34:34,785
and Blade Master Huang Shaotian from Team Blue Rain

559
00:34:34,785 --> 00:34:37,488
it may be impossible for all of them to get through.

560
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:06,161
Ultimate Chaotic Rain from Swoksaar.

561
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:13,722
No interruption. Team Happy must get away from the Ultimate as soon as possible.

562
00:35:16,265 --> 00:35:18,802
As we expected, Troubling Rain is going for Lord Grim.

563
00:35:18,802 --> 00:35:20,937
I'm coming, Lao Ye. Take that!

564
00:35:20,937 --> 00:35:23,322
Dragon Cut. Phoenix Cut. Triple Cut.

565
00:35:23,322 --> 00:35:25,310
Cut, cut, cut!

566
00:35:26,020 --> 00:35:28,080
Finally, it's our battle! Are you afraid?

567
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:32,660
Now I tell you, don't cry after losing the game. Take that!

568
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:35,420
Slow down. It's too violent for the beginning.

569
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:37,500
I'm afraid you'll be short of momentum later.

570
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:40,600
I won't. You'd better worry about yourself.

571
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:43,334
Don't you believe you'll win with the help of Master Wei.

572
00:35:43,334 --> 00:35:45,200
Unfortunately, your rival is me today.

573
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:47,900
I'm a corgi if I can't beat you close to death.

574
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:50,697
Top-level confrontation at the very beginning.

575
00:35:50,697 --> 00:35:53,897
That's right. We can see at the very beginning, it's the long-anticipated confrontation.

576
00:35:53,897 --> 00:35:55,980
Troubling Rain vs. Lord Grim.

577
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:59,040
They keep a distance to look for an opportunity.

578
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:09,440
Lord Grim attacks first.

579
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:10,880
And then slips away.

580
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,917
I guess he doesn't want to waste time here.

581
00:36:12,917 --> 00:36:16,951
Stop! You're shameless. Come fight with me!

582
00:36:19,162 --> 00:36:21,305
All right. The first confrontation between Troubling Rain and Lord Grim

583
00:36:21,305 --> 00:36:24,420
ended up with Lord Grim's tactical retreat.

584
00:36:25,562 --> 00:36:29,105
On another side of the map, What is the Warlock of Team Team Happy doing?

585
00:36:29,105 --> 00:36:33,397
No one in Team Blue Rain attacks him. They just leave Windward Formation here alone.

586
00:36:34,199 --> 00:36:36,268
At this time, Windward Formation should finish the schedule as soon as possible,

587
00:36:36,268 --> 00:36:38,480
or go meet with his teammates.

588
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:46,780
Waste his ability? It seems Windward Formation doesn't want to fight.

589
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:48,820
It's a good place to have a walk in the town.

590
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:50,100
But in such a serious battle,

591
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:52,790
I wonder what the players of Team Happy will think

592
00:36:52,790 --> 00:36:54,520
of this behavior when they find what he is doing.

593
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:58,462
In addition, we noticed that Windward Formation's weapon is a purple wand.

594
00:37:11,225 --> 00:37:14,560
He just sits down. He's not at all nervous.

595
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:17,620
Is this a part of Master Ye Qiu's tactics?

596
00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:21,017
I've never seen such tactics before.

597
00:37:26,782 --> 00:37:29,765
One Inch Ashi vs. Brilliant Edge. 
 - Dodge.

598
00:37:29,765 --> 00:37:31,488
Two against one can be achieved here.

599
00:37:31,488 --> 00:37:33,600
But Windward Formation looks like he hasn't noticed.

600
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:36,120
Senior Wei. I need your help.

601
00:37:38,170 --> 00:37:40,140
   

602
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:45,500
Thanks, senior.

603
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:47,500
Don't get me wrong.

604
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:49,620
Well, don't get me wrong.

605
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:51,620
Go on fighting.

606
00:38:01,451 --> 00:38:03,832
That's right. Hit him. Hit!

607
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,520
Captain. There's a Warlock sitting beside me.

608
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:14,031
He doesn't attack or retreat. I don't know what's wrong with him.

609
00:38:14,031 --> 00:38:15,100
Where are you?

610
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:18,480
Coordinates: 312 662

611
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:21,240
- Qi Master, cover me. 
 - Got it.

612
00:38:23,442 --> 00:38:25,400
Here comes the Qi Master of Team Blue Rain; Cloud Seize!

613
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:27,900
He successfully hit Windward Formation.

614
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:34,060
Successful sneak attack!

615
00:38:34,060 --> 00:38:35,460
You said it so loudly.

616
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:37,280
Could it be called as a sneak attack?

617
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:39,300
Do you need me to teach you, youngster?

618
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:42,600
Lao Ye. I've been caught.

619
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:44,720
- What can I do? 
 - It's good.

620
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:48,600
It's your style to be caught and beaten, then finally give up and admit defeat.

621
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:51,000
You want to be against me?

622
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,540
All right. I'll let you see how I lose.

623
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:04,200
Senior.

624
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:06,560
Who asked you to save me?

625
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:09,200
Senior. Was I wrong to save you?

626
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:11,302
Of course you are. Do you have time to waste making an Ice Boundary?

627
00:39:11,302 --> 00:39:13,248
It's better to leave me and run.

628
00:39:13,248 --> 00:39:14,451
But you said before,

629
00:39:14,451 --> 00:39:16,337
the essence of containment strategy is to strike only after the enemy has attacked.

630
00:39:16,337 --> 00:39:20,040
If I run away now, what if they attack you in the rear?

631
00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:24,220
This lad has a good memory.

632
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:25,520
You're so despicable.

633
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:27,140
Let the Warlock lie there to attract me to attack,

634
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:29,842
and then let the Ghost attack me in the rear. Shameless.

635
00:39:29,842 --> 00:39:31,488
Hasn't your captain told you

636
00:39:31,488 --> 00:39:35,040
the formation of Team Blue Rain is all about containment?

637
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:38,300
Yifan.

638
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:41,900
Let's show him what containment really is.

639
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:43,188
Okay. Senior.

640
00:39:43,188 --> 00:39:46,182
Can you stop running? Lao Ye.

641
00:39:46,182 --> 00:39:48,200
Are you imitating Sun Xiang today?

642
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:51,997
Don't be afraid. We'd have a confrontation if you were a man.

643
00:39:51,997 --> 00:39:54,105
Troubling Rain is still chasing for Lord Grim.

644
00:39:54,105 --> 00:39:56,830
But it seems that he has lost his target.

645
00:39:56,830 --> 00:39:59,280
   

646
00:40:02,482 --> 00:40:05,320
Lao Ye, even you have your day.

647
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:08,360
In order to save your life, you don't even dare to go face to face with me.

648
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:11,160
I'm gonna catch you now.

649
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:21,320
There you go.

650
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:25,742
There's no love in the corner. But in the rear.

651
00:40:25,742 --> 00:40:28,025
That's unbelievable. Troubling Rain has been kicked by Lord Grim...

652
00:40:28,025 --> 00:40:29,965
What are you thinking about, Shaotian?

653
00:40:29,965 --> 00:40:31,840
I'm right by your side.

654
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:34,180
Why don't you turn around and see me?

655
