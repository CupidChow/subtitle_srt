 "Light From the Ashes" - Cai Wei Ze 

2
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:06,270
♫  Countless fireflies born from insignificance  ♫

3
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:10,130
♫  Riding the long wind to gather into a shining galaxy  ♫

4
00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:13,960
♫  Proclaim to the world on top of the sky  ♫

5
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:18,880
♫  We will return in glory  ♫

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,840
♫  Clear the clouds and descend with the heat  ♫

7
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:27,460
♫  Melting ice and snow, overcoming twists and turns  ♫

8
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:31,210
♫  Finally at this moment of peak  ♫

9
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:35,310
♫  There is a figure that coincides with the past  ♫

10
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:39,080
♫  The glory of the past that never came  ♫

11
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:42,790
♫  The pride that the future will never pass  ♫

12
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:46,600
♫  Our fingertips intertwined and condensed  ♫

13
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:50,510
♫  Into a song that ignited the battlefield  ♫

14
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:54,230
♫  The only light in an endless night  ♫

15
00:00:54,230 --> 00:00:58,090
♫  Is you and me who overcame mediocrity  ♫

16
00:00:58,090 --> 00:01:02,020
♫  Up on the clouds and down in the dust  ♫

17
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:05,790
♫  Fireflies making every effort to illuminate  ♫

18
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:09,690
♫  I came from the legend to carry on a legend  ♫

19
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:13,470
♫  Once it's disruptive, a decade of persistence won't be in vain  ♫

20
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:17,420
♫  Up on the clouds and down in the dust  ♫

21
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:21,240
♫  Fireflies making every effort to illuminate  ♫

22
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:24,950
♫  Fireflies making every effort to illuminate  ♫

23
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:28,200
   

24
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:32,480
   

25
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:38,460
So they were undercover agents from other teams.

26
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:40,180
Who gave them the courage?

27
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:43,200
Good thing they deliberately attacked the stone wall.

28
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,120
So we clutched the boss kill last second using an unconventional strategy.

29
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:47,300
&nbsp;

30
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:52,500
I think Senior probably adapted this strategy when the first attempt failed.

31
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:56,800
So he deliberately let them throw the game* on the second attempt.  (*deliberately trying to play bad)  

32
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:59,100
Senior, have I guessed right?

33
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:00,720
You are half right.

34
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:04,200
The person who discovered it was not me. It was Luo Ji.

35
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,660
Excuse me for interrupting.

36
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:07,600
You left out two decimal places.

37
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,700
It should be 103245.618.

38
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:13,480
Stop talking. Shut up! Whatever boss says is right. Understand?

39
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:15,100
103245.618?

40
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:17,700
- Correct. 
 - I'll keep that in mind.

41
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:19,620
So you already had a plan.

42
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:22,220
But you let Guo Guo get that anxious.

43
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:27,780
Cheers, for our boss.

44
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:30,900
Wish her good luck in the exam.

45
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:33,700
Or wish her a miracle!

46
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:35,200
Okay.

47
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,920
- Here. 
 - Cheers!

48

 Subtitles and Timing provided to you by💥🍥 TEAM 7️⃣ 🍥💥 @viki.com 

49
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,920
 The reason they did better than you 

50
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:48,780
 was not that they were stronger and better, 

51
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:53,120
 but that you've already stopped yourself before you even started. 

52
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:57,300
 You want to build a team. I won't object to that. 

53
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:00,900
 But have you ever weighed if you are cut out for it? 

54
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:05,740
 Anyway, you've been known to be a quitter. 

55
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:09,740
 Since you're not up for it, don't push it. 

56
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,700
Sorry for taking your time to see me off.

57
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:42,400
Will you come back to Hangzhou after the Spring Festival?

58
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,400
Yes, Captain wanted me to go back.

59
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:48,720
Your captain's got a good eye.

60
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:52,060
Captain said that though my Assassin scored negative points,

61
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:54,900
but my Phantom Demon actually got a zero point.

62
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:58,100
He wants me to rejoin the team and start fresh.

63
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:01,900
He has set the starting point for you.

64
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:04,360
Where you'll end up

65
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,360
is still up to you.

66
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:12,900
Senior, I'm so glad I got to play Glory with you.

67
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:17,700
Go ahead.

68
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:20,160
Hop on the bus quick!

69
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,740
Senior, I'll work extra hard!

70
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:25,701
I'll remember everything you taught me.

71
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:44,220
Good luck, and happy new year!

72
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:47,300
Thank you. Happy new year!

73
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:55,140
♫  As you always are  ♫

74
00:04:56,760 --> 00:05:02,080
♫  Maintaining composure even as you leave  ♫

75
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:08,300
♫  As I always do  ♫

76
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:14,700
♫  Writing this legend's narrative conclusion  ♫

77
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:17,920
♫  Aim higher and rise above mediocrity  ♫

78
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:21,160
♫  Push past the limits and conquer the peak  ♫

79
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,200
Under any circumstances,

80
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:26,440
never give up.

81
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:30,700
♫  Though engulfed in a storm of hardship  ♫

82
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:33,920
♫  Remaining steadfast on the pinnacle of greatness  ♫

83
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:37,220
♫  That's when I grasped who I was in the past  ♫

84
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:39,900
♫  Always trying to be my own hero  ♫

85
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:47,700
♫  Now, I have seen the legend  ♫

86
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:00,360
Anyway, you've been known to be a quitter.

87
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:03,940
Since you're not up for it, don't push it.

88
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:10,660
But I have tried my best...

89
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:11,770
You failed the certification exam.

90
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:12,920
And mistakenly accepted the Guardian Challenge.

91
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:15,720
You‘re not qualified to be the team's boss at all.

92
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:18,800
Mistakenly accepted the Guardian Challenge.

93
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,500
I didn't do it on purpose.

94
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,240
I didn't know...

95
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:25,840
Then go talk to Grandmaster now!

96
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,800
Grandmaster is leaving?

97
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:19,880
Ye Xiu!

98
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:23,400
You're back. I have something to tell you.

99
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:26,700
Hold up. Don't say anything. Listen to me first.

100
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:29,180
Alright, you go first.

101
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,600
I'd like to...

102
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:35,120
Show you around again.

103
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,700
What do you think of this place?

104
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:47,560
It can serve as a lounge for your team.

105
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:54,780
It's a bit noisy.

106
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,220
Come with me.

107
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:01,380
This is a VIP room.

108
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:02,860
The door and windows are all soundproof.

109
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:05,100
It can serve as your Strategy Room.

110
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:07,260
You would never be disturbed here.

111
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:08,600
It's pretty good.

112
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,400
Just a little too small.

113
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,000
What do you think of this room?

114
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,600
It has good lighting.

115
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,500
We can make it your team dormitory.

116
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:19,320
It's quite cozy.

117
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:22,100
You can decorate it as you like.

118
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:23,900
It still needs to be decorated?

119
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:26,700
I can't wait that long.

120
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:29,100
Look at this place.

121
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:30,740
It's perfect.

122
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:32,400
You guys can train here.

123
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:36,040
We can change the layout of these tables.

124
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:40,740
Trust me. I can get it done in a day.

125
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:46,400
I hope your team will thrive.

126
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,600
Why is it

127
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,420
"your team"?

128
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:58,820
When you are looking for a partner,

129
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,620
don't go for someone like me.

130
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:05,680
You should get someone reliable and experienced.

131
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:09,800
Ye Xiu, you have to return to the league.

132
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:14,100
I will root for you.

133
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:16,700
Even though I can't be your partner,

134
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:20,480
I am still your number one fan.

135
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:27,320
This is what you call an effort?

136
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,700
I don't want you to leave.

137
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:40,900
This place can serve as your base.

138
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:42,800
Lodging and everything will be free. For real.

139
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,581
I don't want anything. I...

140
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:48,700
All I want...

141
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:55,880
All I want is that you guys stay.

142
00:09:57,900 --> 00:10:00,100
Is that okay?

143
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,100
After having said so much,

144
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:08,800
I found that you're really stupid.

145
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,400
You're even willing to operate a business at a loss.

146
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:16,600
I know.

147
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:19,540
I always screw things up.

148
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:20,900
That's right.

149
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:22,900
Mistakenly accepting the Guardian Challenge was your fault.

150
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:24,040
Leaving without saying goodbye

151
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:26,300
and making us miss our victory was also your fault.

152
00:10:26,304 --> 00:10:30,200
But do you know what your biggest problem was?

153
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:33,900
Your biggest problem was

154
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:36,600
giving the guild a wrong name.

155
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:42,700
What was it? Unrivaled Super Hottie?

156
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,440
It should be called...

157
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,860
Happy.

158
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:03,820
What... What does that mean?

159
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:07,960
Let's start over again.

160
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:10,840
I'm Ye Xiu, a professional esports player,

161
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:14,320
applying to be the captain of the Team Happy.

162
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:25,900
Nice to meet you. I am...

163
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:28,640
the team manager of Team Happy.

164
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:31,980
I look forward to working with you.

165
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:49,700
But I screwed up two things.

166
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:55,420
There's a third one.

167
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:56,740
What is that?

168
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:59,340
If you screwed up the first two tasks,

169
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:03,680
we should redo them together.

170
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,620
Cheer up.

171
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:18,160
By the way, how many more points do you need to pass today's exam?

172
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:25,560
10 points.

173
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:27,480
Next time you have to pass it.

174
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,460
It's too difficult!

175
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:31,080
Really.

176
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:34,880
I'll have to prepare for the exam while managing the guild.

177
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:38,560
I... I simply can't do it.

178
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:42,520
Luckily, I got you some help.

179
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:45,480
Just wait for it.

180
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:27,940
 Dad, I'm going to do something earth-shattering. 

181
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:31,600
 I'm going to build a team. 

182
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:35,760
 Am I making the impossible possible? 

183
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,360
Regardless of the distance,

184
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,480
once you lock on to the target, concentrate on aiming it.

185
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,800
Don't give up and you'll be able to hit it.

186
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:54,440
By the way, the name of the team is

187
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,980
Happy.

188
00:13:57,980 --> 00:14:04,200
   

189
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:07,920
   

190
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:12,180
   

191
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:31,480
So it really is a net cafe.

192
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:39,160
No customer here?

193
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,620
Uhm... Assign me a computer.

194
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:48,712
Sorry. The boss is preparing for an exam.

195
00:14:48,712 --> 00:14:50,280
We're closed for half a day.

196
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:54,001
I'm going nuts. I recognize every word in this book.

197
00:14:54,001 --> 00:14:55,881
How come I don't understand anything when the words are strung together?

198
00:14:55,881 --> 00:14:59,680
I'm talking to you. Show some respect, okay?

199
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,180
If you don't assign me a computer, I'll keep nagging you.

200
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:03,320
Just assign me one. I'll play for an hour and leave. Alright?

201
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,680
But can you promise that you'll be a quiet pretty boy

202
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:06,940
who won't even say a word?

203
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:29,080
Alright, Area B, No. 25.

204
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:43,820
Do you know me?

205
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:45,680
No, I don't.

206
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:51,461
Are you the only person here in the net cafe?

207
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:13,881
Why did he ask if I was the only person here?

208
00:16:13,881 --> 00:16:16,720
He wouldn't happen to be this bad guy, would he?

209
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:28,540
Holy cow!

210
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:31,990
It really is him!

211
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:33,830
   

212
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:02,640
Hello?

213
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:05,680
Bro, where are you? The captain is looking for you.

214
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:08,561
Didn't I tell you yesterday that I'll be on a business trip today?

215
00:17:08,561 --> 00:17:11,320
No way! You really went to Happy to meet Lord Grim.

216
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:12,940
 You are the guild master of the Blue Brook Guild. 

217
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:16,260
 How could you be so easily lured into meeting him? 

218
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:19,020
Bound Boat, listen to me.

219
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:23,100
The thing is, why did the undercover agents we sent to the Happy Guild

220
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:25,500
get caught so easily?

221
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,740
 Because you were so bad at disguising. 

222
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:30,180
 You... You guys did a terrible job disguising yourselves. 

223
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:33,880
So I had no choice but to go behind enemy lines.

224
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:37,080
I came here to find out about the Happy Guild.

225
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:38,780
How many members do they have?

226
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:40,700
 How many coaches? 

227
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:43,180
Who's the boss behind the scene?

228
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:44,820
Could you guys figure these out?

229
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:46,700
You can't!

230
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:48,180
So don't bother me if you don't have anything important to say.

231
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:50,600
If I find anything, I'll talk to the captain.

232
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:53,360
Alright, got to go.

233
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:56,700
This won't do. I have to call the police.

234
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:58,440
That's right.

235
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:01,440
Call the police.

236
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:10,340
Why did this computer crash again?

237
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:13,000
So annoying!

238
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,720
I need another computer.

239
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,700
What's this crap?

240
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:18,280
Hello?

241
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:21,600
Hello, I want to—

242
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:30,840
Didn't you hear me shouting?

243
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:33,881
The computer crashed. Assign me another one, please.

244
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:36,770
   

245
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,820
I'll do it!

246
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:43,460
Hold on a second.

247
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:46,080
What are the rooms upstairs for?

248
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:52,880
Those are the private rooms.

249
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,160
Can I play in a private room?

250
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,980
Yes, you can.

251
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:57,280
So assign me one!

252
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:00,420
You can just go straight upstairs.

253
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:02,040
Alright.

254
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:06,080
Don't go up and bother me, okay?

255
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,920
   

256
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:25,900
No, no, no, don't do it!

257
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,520
Professional team manager?

258
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:32,400
You're going to take the exam for this?

259
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:37,120
I've taken this exam before! It was so easy!

260
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:42,860
You only need to memorize the exam outlines

261
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:46,060
and read the industry analysis tables multiple times.

262
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:48,480
Then you'll be able to pass with your eyes closed.

263
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:55,640
Is esports really so popular these days?

264
00:19:55,640 --> 00:20:00,100
Even a cafe attendant like you wants to join the grand Glory scene.

265
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:02,580
Good, good, good.

266
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:06,780
Alright, good luck! You can do it!

267
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:25,960
No, no.

268
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:27,500
I have to talk to Ye Xiu.

269
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,800
I need to get Ye Xiu and Steamed Bun back here.

270
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:35,780
Hello, Ye Xiu?

271
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:41,460
A weird guy is in our net cafe now.

272
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:43,480
- Hello, boss. 
 - Boss!

273
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:46,041
- We just got out of the supermarket. 
 - Let me help you.

274
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:49,900
It's alright. Pick them up.

275
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:51,820
Okay.

276
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:54,020
- Boss, continue— 
  - I'm telling you. 

277
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:56,341
 - There's a rather strange guy in our net cafe now.  
 - Boss?

278
00:20:56,341 --> 00:20:57,600
- Boss! 
 - The connection is bad.

279
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,160
 I'm telling you. 

280
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:02,420
I suspect that he may be a wanted criminal.

281
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:06,460
No, he is a wanted criminal.

282
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:10,260
But don't worry, I acted normally.

283
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:15,060
What? Cumin*? Boss? 
  (*Chinese pinyin for "cumin" is same as "normally") 

284
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:18,300
Cumin? Is the boss preparing for a barbeque?

285
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:22,700
Boss, please continue.

286
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:25,400
Come back as soon as possible.

287
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:28,200
I'm worried that he will escape.

288
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,040
Peach*? 
  (*Chinese pinyin for "peach" is same as "escape") 

289
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:34,000
Go, go, go!

290
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,480
Let's go!

291
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:37,640
I will come back later.

292
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:50,980
As expected, they're going to build a team.

293
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:53,061
The lineup, schedule,

294
00:21:53,061 --> 00:21:55,120
Guardian Challenge, 3D maps, simulation diagrams.

295
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:59,620
I... Good for you, Lord Grim!

296
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:02,460
So you already knew there were undercover agents in the guild.

297
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:05,620
You had the audacity to use us for burst damage.

298
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:09,100
I will record everything and study them later.

299
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:11,060
Here we go!

300
00:22:19,421 --> 00:22:22,100
There's a person in here! Why did you lock the door?

301
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:25,634
Outstanding citizen outsmarting a wanted criminal.

302
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:31,400
Don't think I won't recognize you just because you're wearing a wig.

303
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:46,301
Who gave your shady net cafe the right to lock me up?

304
00:22:46,301 --> 00:22:48,060
- Stay away from me! 
 - You...

305
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:49,490
Stay away, you wanted criminal!

306
00:22:49,490 --> 00:22:50,760
Who is a wanted criminal?

307
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:52,120
I'm warning you!

308
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:54,020
- You called the police? 
 - I should be the one to call the police!

309
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:56,100
You! Called the police?

310
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:57,900
How lively!

311
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:03,100
As a young, promising, handsome man with luxuriant hair,

312
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:05,600
do I look anything like that bald wanted criminal?

313
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:10,020
See for yourself. Any similarities?

314
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,300
Can't see it clearly? Let's zoom in.

315
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:14,200
You'll be able to see it when we zoom in.

316
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:18,240
Hold on.

317
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:21,740
My name is Xu Boyuan.

318
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:23,960
Is his name Xu Boyuan?

319
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:25,860
I am a kind netizen.

320
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:29,000
First, I didn't break the law. Second, I didn't default on the net cafe fees.

321
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,600
If you don't give me an explanation today,

322
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:37,400
I'll go to the Consumers Association to file a complaint against you.

323
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:41,780
Speaking of the net cafe fee, I'd like to review the billable items with you.

324
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:44,921
- Go ahead. 
 - Two hours in the 2F VIP room.

325
00:23:44,921 --> 00:23:46,300
A total of 50 yuan. Is that right?

326
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:48,500
The two hours...

327
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:49,900
Fine.

328
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:52,100
I deposited 100 yuan at the reception counter.

329
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:55,100
I didn't go overtime. Nor did I overspend. Right?

330
00:23:56,381 --> 00:23:58,620
You damaged a door lock on the second floor.

331
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:00,480
It's worth 130 yuan.

332
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:04,400
Fine, I'll pay for the damaged lock.

333
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:07,420
In our net cafe,

334
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:10,020
all the door locks are uniformly configured.

335
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:13,220
So we'll have to change all locks in the whole net cafe.

336
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:15,660
There are ten doors so the total is 1,300 yuan.

337
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:18,260
- Why do you have to change all of them? 
 - Oh, right.

338
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:20,200
When you came down with the boss

339
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:22,200
you accidentally broke a vase.

340
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,700
This vase iteself is not expensive,

341
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:27,360
but the water splashed onto the socket next to it.

342
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,780
Now the entire ground floor is short-circuited.

343
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:33,300
Nonsense! The...

344
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:35,580
How is it short-circuited?

345
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:38,000
- I'm telling you... 
 - The power outage has caused us

346
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:42,120
to be unable to do business. The loss is quite serious.

347
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:43,900
Don't lie to me on this.

348
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:47,700
Before I came in earlier, I saw the notice that the net cafe is closed today.

349
00:24:57,040 --> 00:25:00,780
Now, we're open.

350
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:03,000
I...

351
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,000
In fact, our net cafe is usually very busy.

352
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,600
The turnover in half a day is between

353
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:11,300
20,000 to 50,000 yuan. I'll give you a discount.

354
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:14,200
Let's make it 35,000 yuan.

355
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:16,510
After deducting the deposit...

356
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:20,160
The total is 36,550 yuan.

357
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:22,180
With the discount...

358
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:23,660
It's 35,000 yuan.

359
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:25,500
Card or cash?

360
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:29,400
What... What is this? Don't try to fool me.

361
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:32,680
But I'm okay with labor in lieu of payment.

362
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:35,180
I heard you worked as a team manager for some time.

363
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:37,761
So you should know how to pass the certification exam.

364
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:40,300
Blue River.

365
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:43,040
How did...

366
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:45,740
You... How did you...

367
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:50,400
You... Are you Lord Grim?

368
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:53,480
Clever.

369
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,000
So it's you! I've been looking for...

370
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:03,880
Oh, so it's... It's you...

371
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:06,280
So you're Lord Grim.

372
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:10,920
But how did you know that I'm Blue River?

373
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:15,520
In Blue Rain, you're the smartest guy next to Yu Wenzhou.

374
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:19,360
So I'll leave our boss in your hands.

375
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,700
Good luck, Blue River!

376
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:28,660
He's getting better at making deals.

377
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:30,380
No wonder he's my Grandmaster.

378
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:32,260
He's becoming more and more like me.

379
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:34,120
He's got such a refreshing personality

380
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:36,400
that remains the same whether online or offline.

381
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,000
As expected of Blue River.

382
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,500
Grandmaster, the boss you're talking about is...

383
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:43,340
The boss is...

384
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:53,920
I fell into their trap.

385
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:57,440
I came to spy. How did I end up giving lessons?

386
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:59,300
No way, this won't do.

387
00:27:03,641 --> 00:27:07,250
Are you ready, Mr. Blue? Can we start now?

388
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:08,500
   

389
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:15,200
Well, Ye Qiu.

390
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:19,600
Even though you're a grandmaster, there are some things I have to clarify with you.

391
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:22,540
I came to this city on a business trip.

392
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:24,800
It's just a coincidence that I came to this net cafe.

393
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:27,540
It's an even bigger coincidence that I met you.

394
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:29,340
And, I still have some

395
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:32,260
important things to do.

396
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:36,320
I understand.

397
00:27:37,373 --> 00:27:40,080
There's a meeting I've been anticipating for.

398
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:41,540
It's very important.

399
00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:44,160
I may have to leave right away.

400
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,600
For how long?

401
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:51,800
One hour.

402
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:54,120
Okay, good. Go ahead.

403
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:06,300
Drop the act. Just give the lesson.

404
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:08,400
Go now, quick.

405
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:12,700
Esports is the best combination of the internet and sports.

406
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:16,900
Esports is now a recognized global sport.

407
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:19,800
It has been successfully included in the Asian Games.

408
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:22,600
Esports teams are one of the pillars of the esports industry.

409
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:24,920
If you want a team that is sustainable,

410
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:27,700
implementing reasonable adjustments to operational processes is vital.

411
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:29,330
And good operational mechanisms

412
00:28:29,330 --> 00:28:32,000
are related to the flow of funds.

413
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,180
&nbsp;

414
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:37,440
The guilds in Glory provide essential support for the teams.

415
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,700
Teams can't thrive without the supplies from the guilds.

416
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:43,320
Therefore, the development of the guild is important to the foundation of a team.

417
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:45,140
For a newly established guild like yours,

418
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:47,480
- the most important thing is that... 
 - So well-behaved.

419
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:50,501
I've never seen her study so hard.

420
00:28:50,501 --> 00:28:52,881
I've never seen anyone who likes to play tricks more than that guy.

421
00:28:52,881 --> 00:28:56,580
You guys who like playing tricks are really despicable.

422
00:28:56,580 --> 00:28:59,740
And you guys who work as tutors have big hearts.

423
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:03,260
Of course, you have to learn how to recruit people in Glory.

424
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:05,800
Members recruited here are the most loyal ones.

425
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:07,281
In the later development of the guild,

426
00:29:07,281 --> 00:29:08,960
they will become the guild's competitive lineup.

427
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,620
They are the guardians of the guild.

428
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:13,020
Group admins will also play a critical role.

429
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:18,200
Group admins shouldn't be the ones who are simply active and motivating in the group.

430
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:21,100
We should choose those who are passionate about the guild,

431
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:23,440
have a strong sense of responsibility and possess management skills.

432
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:25,490
Especially those who are able to

433
00:29:25,490 --> 00:29:27,400
coordinate the conflicts between the guild members.

434
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:31,880
They are the ones who can reduce friction and allow for an efficient operation in the guild.

435
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:32,000
   

436
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,921
The most important thing is that you have to learn how to set goals

437
00:29:34,921 --> 00:29:36,900
when you implement a structured membership system.

438
00:29:58,340 --> 00:30:00,560
Leaving without saying goodbye?

439
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:12,200
Master, my bro,

440
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:16,320
I... I am in a hurry to attend the meeting. I've got to go now.

441
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,540
Have you taught the boss anything?

442
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:29,720
Bro, I've really tried my best.

443
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:32,000
I told her everything I should and shouldn't.

444
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,000
The only thing I didn't do was give her Blue Brook Guild.

445
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:39,440
It seems that our boss is really not cut out for it.

446
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:40,290
She really isn't.

447
00:30:40,290 --> 00:30:41,840
So it seems that the certification exam is a great challenge for her.

448
00:30:41,841 --> 00:30:42,810
She definitely will not pass it.

449
00:30:42,810 --> 00:30:44,600
So I can't leave the guild in her hands.

450
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:45,790
Of course you can't.

451
00:30:45,790 --> 00:30:47,300
So you're the only one who can manage our guild.

452
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:48,800
Of course I'm...

453
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:51,040
No, I didn't mean that.

454
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:53,400
Give the position back to her when the boss passes the exam.

455
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:55,460
Brother Master! I didn't mean that!

456
00:30:55,460 --> 00:30:56,900
Want a salary?

457
00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:58,700
- No... No! 
 - I knew it!

458
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:00,400
Blue River you're the best.

459
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:03,600
I'm not being the best! I still have my job!

460
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:04,920
Besides, later, I'll have to...

461
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:07,040
Later, I'm having a video call with Yu Wenzhou.

462
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:08,880
Do you want to say hi to him?

463
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:10,880
No need. I have to go.

464
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:12,660
Why not have some breakfast before you leave?

465
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:15,380
I can't afford to do that.

466
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:17,460
So I'll leave the guild in your hands!

467
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:19,360
Good luck!

468
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:21,410
   

469
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:54,100
 What are you doing? 

470
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:55,860
 What's going on? 

471
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:58,501
 - A thief! 
 - Stop! 

472
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:01,100
 Are you okay? 

473
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:04,080
 Get up. 

474
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:07,800
 I'm sorry. 

475
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:09,520
 No worries. 

476
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:13,980
 I have to go now. 

477
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:16,660
 - Thank you! 
 - No worries, no worries. 

478
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:24,420
♫  But make it seem like you don't care  ♫

479
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:28,560
 Your backpack! 

480
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:33,120
Zoning out?

481
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:37,460
Tang, look at this. Do you still remember?

482
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:41,300
Are you trying to remind me of

483
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:43,900
the stupid mistake I made

484
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:46,121
that caused you to miss the most important exam of your life?

485
00:32:46,121 --> 00:32:51,020
Look! I rarely have a day to tidy up the room!

486
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:57,100
Alright, stop hiding.

487
00:32:57,100 --> 00:33:01,260
These are all just props you prepared.

488
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:15,660
To be honest, I never wanted to take that exam.

489
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:18,680
So helping you catch the thief

490
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:21,200
and grabbing the wrong backpack

491
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,700
became the perfect excuse for me to lose the exam admission ticket.

492
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:26,440
After that, every year during my vacation,

493
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:29,360
I asked you to tutor me,

494
00:33:30,460 --> 00:33:33,220
just so you would spend more time with me.

495
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:38,640
I tried so hard to prepare for the exam.

496
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:41,580
I tried so hard to make myself worthy of being your friend,

497
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:44,880
despite the fact that I never passed the exam.

498
00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:48,260
Look at these.

499
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:51,460
I put all my IQ points into these.

500
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:55,140
Maybe taking the professional manager exam is a better choice for me.

501
00:33:56,980 --> 00:33:58,660
All right.

502
00:33:58,660 --> 00:34:04,060
Actually, since the first time I tutored you,

503
00:34:04,060 --> 00:34:07,080
I already knew all your ulterior motives.

504
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:15,680
I didn't know you were so sharp!

505
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:23,100
Coming here to tutor you

506
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:27,400
is actually an excuse for myself, as well.

507
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:32,360
I come to Happy Internet Cafe to escape.

508
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:36,860
No matter what you're trying to escape from,

509
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:39,240
please come here more often.

510
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:41,940
I probably won't be able to come here often.

511
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:43,640
Why?

512
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:48,260
The Berklee College of Music sent me an invitation.

513
00:34:49,060 --> 00:34:52,060
I'll have to leave after the Spring Festival.

514
00:34:52,060 --> 00:34:54,540
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

515
00:34:57,180 --> 00:35:01,380
To be honest, I had been struggling to make the decision.

516
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:05,660
But I didn't want to miss such a good opportunity.

517
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:10,600
Shouldn't you be happy for me, as well?

518
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:13,980
Guo Guo.

519
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:18,100
Both of us should make a choice now.

520
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:32,040
   

521
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,540
Time flies.

522
00:35:52,540 --> 00:35:54,000
In the blink of an eye, the Spring Festival comes.

523
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,240
Everyone needs to say goodbye and go back to their hometown.

524
00:35:56,240 --> 00:36:00,180
Only Ye Xiu didn't leave for whatever reason.

525
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:03,620
Actually, I...

526
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:06,420
Looking forward to your next visit!

527
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,960
Take care of yourself.

528
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:25,320
   

529
00:36:27,010 --> 00:36:28,940
   

530
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:35,500
This is the first Spring Festival I get to spend with Ye Xiu and Mu Cheng.

531
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:38,540
I have to maintain a nice image.

532
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:42,700
This coat doesn't look quite right.

533
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:44,560
Not good.

534
00:36:49,580 --> 00:36:52,140
No more coats.

535
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:53,320
Maybe I should settle for this one.

536
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:55,480
The color looks pretty nice.

537
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:57,460
Still a bit off.

538
00:36:58,660 --> 00:37:01,460
After all, I'm also the manager of the team.

539
00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:04,440
I should wear something with a bit more personality.

540
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,500
It's not enough to wear a branded scarf.

541
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:31,980
Fashion taste highlights your character.

542
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:34,760
People will judge your value based on your character.

543
00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:40,180
I'm counting on you now.

544
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:08,880
How is it going?

545
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:14,760
Oh my goodness.

546
00:38:15,940 --> 00:38:17,960
It's covered with dust.

547
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:20,940
We've run out of rags.

548
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:22,800
Go to my room and find an old piece of clothing.

549
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:25,200
Cut a few pieces from it and use them as rags.

550
00:38:26,380 --> 00:38:29,900
What would count as an "old" piece of clothing?

551
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:30,860
A ragged one

552
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:34,941
or a patched one that looks recyclable at first glance.

553
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:39,880
Good job!

554
00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:49,160
Stop it!

555
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:57,260
What are you holding?

556
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:07,860
You're using my scarf as a rag?

557
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:11,920
A ragged, patched one that looks recyclable.

558
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:13,200
Isn't that the right one?

559
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:14,720
You really pissed me off!

560
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:17,180
The scarf is very expensive!

561
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:19,460
Where's the other half?

562
00:39:22,540 --> 00:39:25,100
What can you do for this net cafe?

563
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:26,361
You couldn't even change the bulb!

564
00:39:26,361 --> 00:39:28,580
You had to be taught how to be a cashier!

565
00:39:28,580 --> 00:39:29,760
I'm so pissed off!

566
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:31,040
You are really use...

567
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:32,780
Less.

568
00:39:32,780 --> 00:39:38,120
 If you want to keep someone from leaving, win his heart first. 

569
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:40,860
 How? 

570
00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:42,380
 Two words. 

571
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:44,380
 Spoil him. 

572
00:39:51,220 --> 00:39:53,660
Non-human.

573
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:56,600
Superman.

574
00:39:59,860 --> 00:40:02,040
Grandmaster.

575
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:03,460
Grandmaster, having you in my Happy Internet Cafe

576
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:06,581
is a blessing accumulated from my previous eight lives!

577
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:11,380
Sorry for my bad temper.

578
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:13,280
I don't need this scarf anymore!

579
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:15,520
I'll buy another one next time.

580
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:18,420
In Spring Festival, we shouldn't be fighting each other.

581
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:20,560
Right, Grandmaster?

582
00:40:21,740 --> 00:40:23,500
So I'll continue.

583
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:25,540
What?

584
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:32,660
You shouldn't be doing this kind of dirty, menial work.

585
00:40:32,660 --> 00:40:34,640
I'll do it!

586
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:36,820
Boss, leave the dirty work to me.

587
00:40:36,820 --> 00:40:38,180
Let me do it!

588
00:40:38,180 --> 00:40:39,400
Let me.

589
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:40,581
We shouldn't be fighting each other.

590
00:40:40,581 --> 00:40:42,460
Just let me do it!

591
00:40:43,620 --> 00:40:45,640
Here. Here.

592
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:47,640
Take this bank card.

593
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:51,600
Go buy some clothes.

594
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:55,480
New year, new threads, good luck.

595
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:57,120
It dropped. Let me pick it up for you.

596
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:59,920
Take it. Go, go.

597
