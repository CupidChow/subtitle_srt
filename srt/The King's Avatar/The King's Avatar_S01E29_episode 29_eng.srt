25
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,000
Dad,

26
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:54,140
I was sitting here the day I left home,

27
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:55,800
you told me that

28
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,900
you don't want me to have no way back while I regret.

29
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,400
Dad,

30
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:04,000
I always want to tell you these years

31
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,560
that I don't need the way back at all.

32
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,700
Cause I never regret.

33
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:15,200
Noodles don't taste good after a long time.

34
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,620
I built a new team.

35
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:25,400
We're going to play
the first National Challenge soon.

36
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,100
I hope

37
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:31,000
you can come and see my game.

38
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:46,400
Go back after eating.

39
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,300
April 2nd.

40
00:03:57,300 --> 00:04:02,000
Remember to ask Guang if he had found a place to live.

41
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,700
May 8th.

42
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:10,460
I can't pass a single level after Guang left.

43
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:14,720
Next he called, remember to tell Guang,

44
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:18,560
the master needs Guang's guidance,

45
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,080
then he can remain a master.

46
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:28,560
Right, did I ask Guang
if he found a place to live?

47
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,760
I must remember to ask next time.

48
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:36,200
July 16th.

49
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,800
Remember to ask Guang,

50
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:43,800
which channel will broadcast
the eSports competition?

51
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:47,720
After Guang becomes a professional player,

52
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:54,540
I can see him on TV when I miss him.

53
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:59,800
Today, I have nothing to tell Guang,

54
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:03,000
but to tell myself,

55
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:11,640
do remember that I'm the master, he is Guang.

56
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:19,500
Our Glory account is Golden Partner.

57
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:25,300
Guang, be sure to get a champion back.

58
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:27,680
I'm waiting for you.

59
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,410
 

60
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:43,860
Ten minutes to go to the stadium.

61
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:46,320
You still have time
for the last round of inspection.

62
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,340
Timing begins.

63
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:18,400
Over.

64
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:22,000
If the speed of Mo Fan's brain circuits
is one-tenth of his movement,

65
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,300
he'll be the captain.

66
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:30,450
Just waiting for you.

67
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:34,500
Let's go.

68
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:13,900
Although I've said it many times,

69
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:16,800
I'd like to emphasize again
before the game starts.

70
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,700
Today our opponent Miracle Team

71
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:21,440
is a veteran team that has been fighting in the League for years.

72
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:25,320
As a veteran team, we are all skilled hands.

73
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:28,480
It's so easy for us Miracle Team
to defeat Xing xin.

74
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:31,840
But even so, we can't let down our guards.

75
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:35,200
Individual Event needs stable operation
and strong output players.

76
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:37,500
Wei Chen, Mo Fan and Tang Rou are suitable.

77
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,920
However, Mo Fan as
a sneak attack soldier of the team,

78
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:43,100
should not be exposed prematurely. You'll be replaced by Luo Ji.

79
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:46,040
Did you hear that, underling? Don't let me down.

80
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,760
Arena Contest is wheel war.

81
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:50,440
The Ghosts of Yi Fan as a support character,

82
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:52,080
is suitable for the first appearance.

83
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,520
Yi Fan, it's all right.

84
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,600
I'll kick the asses that you can't kick.

85
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:59,320
You play unsteadily, so you'll be the second one.

86
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:01,680
Why? Anyway, boss is the last one.

87
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:05,700
He can defeat them all if we don't succeed. Right, boss?

88
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:07,680
I can turn off the monitor and play with them.

89
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,880
Did you hear that? Absolute crush them.

90
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,280
Terminate the war ahead of time.

91
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,480
Right.

92
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,960
What if there are variables?

93
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:16,300
- Why are you saying that? 
 - There won't be.

94
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:20,060
If so, let's just play it by ear.

95
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:22,040
I'll hand in the registration form first.

96
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:25,240
By the way, You have a pre-match interview.

97
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:27,000
Hurry up.

98
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,300
Master Ye Qiu. Microphone.

99
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:35,420
Master. Did you build your team this time to retaliate against Jiashi?

100
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:38,120
Is Jiashi's introduction of Xiao Shi Qin a response to your plan?

101
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:40,101
Fighting Miracle, is your first game after your comeback...

102
00:08:40,101 --> 00:08:42,680
How can such a confidential matter be exposed casually? Tell me about it.

103
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:46,200
Win, is the only tactic.

104
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:50,200
As the captain of Miracle,
what do you think of Xing Xin Team?

105
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,080
They are a very special team.

106
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,480
I think the summary from the outside world
is very incisive.

107
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,880
Weakness and disability.

108
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:58,720
They just need us to give them a lesson.

109
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:02,920
A retired pacifier, with six or seven worthless babies,

110
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:04,400
everyone is pity for them.

111
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,680
Even the boss is a green hand,

112
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:09,900
Maybe she didn't even know
where to hand in the registration form.

113
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:13,400
All in all, the game will be a bonus to us Miracle Team.

114
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:16,180
Turn the corner, and there's a new world.

115
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:18,080
Is everyone ready?

116
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,160
Are you ready to accept the cheers of our fans?

117
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,120
My fame is beyond description.

118
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:26,640
There will be huge crowds of my fans that shout for us with babies.

119
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:29,400
You'll just wait to benefit from me.

120
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:33,400
You still haven't learned to be calm at this age.

121
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,880
I'm setting an example for you.

122
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:41,720
If you're all like me who had the achievements,
will there be fewer fans?

123
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:46,200
Wei, you should go on a stage play.

124
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:49,240
I've got a bunch of fans for everything.

125
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:51,920
The cheers before the game are all credit lines.

126
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,980
Don't be too superstitious.

127
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:57,000
The cheer after the game

128
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,300
is our real strength.

129
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:05,100
That's what I mean.

130
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:07,140
Let's go.

131
00:10:13,291 --> 00:10:14,865
 

132
00:10:14,865 --> 00:10:16,991
 

133
00:10:19,015 --> 00:10:23,112
 

134
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:30,400
What?

135
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:33,900
Have you been intimidated by my fans?

136
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,580
So many fans here today.

137
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:13,200
We are major competition arena, we'll win today.

138
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,700
Hello, where is the registration place, please?

139
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:25,800
Thanks.

140
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:28,040
No wonder I haven't heard of it.

141
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:30,360
How can I get in? Go to the end and turn left.

142
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:32,001
- Thanks. 
 - No problem.

143
00:11:32,001 --> 00:11:34,300
Miss, here is the registration place.

144
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:36,500
Wait, wait.

145
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:40,200
Here is the Team Competition.

146
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:56,680
It's no big deal.

147
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:58,800
There was no one there

148
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,240
when my Net Cafe started business
on the first day.

149
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:04,740
We should take a long-term view of the problem.

150
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,520
Captain Ye Xiu, you are surely not nervous.

151
00:12:15,726 --> 00:12:17,706
I'm very nervous.

152
00:12:20,026 --> 00:12:22,826
The captain means

153
00:12:22,826 --> 00:12:24,600
not to underestimate any opponent.

154
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,600
So it's normal to be nervous.

155
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:29,200
The captain also said
we should be awed of the stage,

156
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:33,400
take every time of going up on the stage
as the first time.

157
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,300
I'm not saying that.

158
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:37,600
I call it strategic nervous.

159
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,500
Just posturing.

160
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:43,700
Hello, friends of the audience at the scene and guys

161
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:45,480
who are watching our live broadcasts. Hello, everyone.

162
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:49,920
This is the first round of the 9th Glory Challenge. I'm the host Luo.

163
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,500
This match is divided into three rounds,

164
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:53,880
Individual Event, Arena Contest
and Team Competition.

165
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:55,920
Three Individual Events.
The winner of each game gets one point.

166
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,640
The winner of Arena Contest gets three points.

167
00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:00,940
The winner of Team Competition
will get five points.

168
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:04,800
Today's game is full of interesting.

169
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:08,300
Master Ye's first show after resurrection,
Xingxin Team's first game.

170
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:11,200
Whether the God of Fights who challenged the alliance can create brilliance again?

171
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,200
It's expected.

172
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:18,260
It's time for me to show my skills.

173
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:19,480
Make a good start.

174
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:21,120
Not only a good start,

175
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,800
I'll crush your opponent with absolute advantage.

176
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:26,800
Good luck.

177
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:27,900
See ya.

178
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:29,500
Go, go, go.

179
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:31,880
Qiao Yi Fan.

180
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:41,730
My god.

181
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:44,170
Sorry.

182
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:55,500
I mixed the form
of Individual Event and Arena Contest.

183
00:13:57,060 --> 00:14:00,100
Isn't that a complete disruption
of the captain's strategic deployment?

184
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:01,500
We could have been strategically scored.

185
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:03,700
Now we're giving them points.

186
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:05,300
What should we do now?

187
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:07,500
There must be a remedy.

188
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,400
I'll go now.

189
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:32,300
Excuse me. Excuse me.

190
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:34,000
Excuse me.

191
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,120
Xing Xin's fan. He's Xing Xin's fan.

192
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:43,770
Beat him, beat him, beat him.

193
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:51,200
As a former Wei Cao's player, Qiao Yi Fan hasn't played a professional game yet.

194
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,480
This is his first real appearance.

195
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:56,380
This stage is brand new and unfamiliar to him.

196
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:58,900
Qiao Yi Fan, come on!

197
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:02,900
Qiao Yi Fan, come on! Qiao Yi Fan.

198
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:08,000
Next let's invite Fang Daxu of Miracle Team.

199
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:13,700
Remember to frighten the kid a bit when going on the stage.

200
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:16,600
Don't worry. I know what to do.

201
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:28,620
Since you are so nervous,

202
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:31,440
I'll see you off earlier.

203
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:50,160
I've tried everything.

204
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:54,500
I almost set a cannon in front of them.

205
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:57,040
But they still won't change.

206
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:04,800
Our first game,

207
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:08,600
such an important game, and I screwed it up.

208
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,760
We can lose.

209
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:15,000
We can lose because of inexperience. We can lose because of tactical error.

210
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:19,700
But not because of my fault on a primary mistake.

211
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:24,400
So how do you want me to answer you?

212
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:30,720
If I'm Qiao Yi Fan,

213
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:33,600
he'll tell you it's okay.

214
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,600
If I'm Bao Zi,

215
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:39,600
he'll say it's no big deal.

216
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:43,600
If I'm Lao Wei, he must say it's nothing.

217
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,600
But it's me that chased you out.

218
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:49,160
I can only tell you the truth.

219
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,700
Guo Guo,

220
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:56,300
you really did wrong this time.

221
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:03,200
Do you think I'm not good enough to be a team manager?

222
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:09,000
I can't help anything

223
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:13,060
while you were training.

224
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:17,860
I can't handle a form

225
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:23,260
in such an important game.

226
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,520
I feel like I'm a real failure.

227
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:33,620
I can do nothing and change nothing.

228
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:36,400
Then don't.

229
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:43,300
Rather than hoping to change the rules,

230
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:46,160
why not choose to trust your teammates?

231
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:50,540
We are a team.

232
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:54,940
Why can't we solve it together when we face difficulties?

233
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:02,000
I'll be waiting for you.

234
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:45,360
Individual Event round one, Xing Xin's Ghostblade,

235
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:48,500
Yi Cun Hui, versus Miracle's Knight. The nonexistent knight.

236
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:50,700
Placeing Ghostblade on the
first round of Individual Event,

237
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:52,240
which is weak at one on one,

238
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,400
it seems like Xing Xin is very confident.

239
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,400
Okay. Let's see how Qiao Yi Fan will behave.

240
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:00,100
Both characters have entered the game map. The game will begin soon.

241
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,021
Miracle's Knight starts very proactively.

242
00:19:05,021 --> 00:19:08,760
He wants to get close to Ghostblade quickly,
limits Ghostblade's skill.

243
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:10,440
Another assault.

244
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,200
Keep pressuring.

245
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,400
Falling Star Hammer. Shield Counter.

246
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,400
Miracle's Knight well played at the beginning.

247
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,540
Yi Cun Hui is consumed continuously.

248
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:17,540
He has no rhythm completely.

249
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:27,160
Captain Ye, how did you teach Yi Fan?

250
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,760
Saw the knight and still don't run.

251
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:30,700
Waiting to be killed?

252
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:33,640
You are still so anxious at this age.

253
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:35,320
Avoid consuming too much blood.

254
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:38,160
It seems that Qiao Yi Fan can't relaxed himself
while going on stage for the first time.

255
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,680
Although the knight got close to you,

256
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,880
if you adjusted the rhythm in time,
keep the distance,

257
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:43,500
it's still possible to fight back.

258
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,920
However, Miracle's Knight fights actively.

259
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:48,720
He pushes Qiao Yi Fan to the limit.

260
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:53,840
I always regard Yi Fan as a good boy,
he has a fragile heart.

261
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,440
He was beaten like that at the beginning.

262
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,720
He'll lose.

263
00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:00,120
Kid, your basic skills are fine.

264
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:02,600
But you are lack of practical experience.

265
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:05,160
I heard you were from Wei Cao originally.

266
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:08,360
I don't think you operate
like a student of Wang Jie Xi's.

267
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:09,960
Matter of time.

268
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:12,300
Keep the distance with Ghost Step.

269
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:16,540
After that, increase opponent's weight by using Ash Boundary,

270
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:18,640
in order to slow him down.

271
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:21,520
Then block him completely with the array of ice.

272
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:25,120
Now it's your show time.

273
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,580
Nice. Nice hit back.

274
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:34,600
Yi Cun Hui grabs the opportunity and
pulls away the distance with Ghost Step.

275
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,240
Ghost Step and Ash Boundary and the array of ice.

276
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:38,540
Restrain specially on Knight.

277
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:41,380
Which genius taught him this?

278
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:44,480
Guess.

279
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:50,320
Wanna win me? Nice try.

280
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:51,740
The timing is very good.

281
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:54,020
Combos of connecting skills in time at the end of control.

282
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:58,160
Keep a good attack rhythm, Yi Cun Hui may have a chance to win.

283
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,161
Ultimate.

284
00:21:11,161 --> 00:21:13,140
Crusader's Trial rush to
Yi Cun Hui directly and all in,

285
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:15,161
Yi Cun Hui was consumed a lot.

286
00:21:15,161 --> 00:21:18,400
Such a pity. Yi Cun Hui fell down at the last moment.

287
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,600
Although he loses the game,

288
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:23,340
Qiao Yi Fan did a wonderful
job in the second half.

289
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:31,300
Well, finally let's congratulate Fang Xuda from Miracle Team gets the first point.

290
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:34,361
However, Fang Xuda's fight back was brilliant.

291
00:21:34,361 --> 00:21:36,820
The Crusader's Trial was too violent.

292
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:37,720
Perfect.

293
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:40,620
Congratulations on Fang Xuda.

294
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:54,060
Captain, Ghostblade can't confront Knight directly.

295
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:56,320
We normally choose to dodge.

296
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:59,760
You can't dodge sucessfully if you meet a true master.

297
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:02,660
You'll be suppressed like this.

298
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:07,060
Yi Fan, Calm yourself down while meeting a tough opponent.

299
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:09,400
Think about possible breakthroughs.

300
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:12,840
Knights are strong, but their skills are limited.

301
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:15,260
You have to learn to conserve your strength.

302
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:20,040
Sorry, captain.

303
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:22,560
I'll win back next time.

304
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:28,080
This kid is really tough.

305
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,900
I almost lose.

306
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:31,920
Good.

307
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:33,780
Good game.

308
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:45,880
Captain.

309
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:47,560
I should keep the distance earlier,

310
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:49,600
and find the breakthrough,

311
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:52,240
so that I won't be beaten so badly afterwards.

312
00:22:55,840 --> 00:23:01,120
Yi Fan, how did it feel to stand on the official court for the first time?

313
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,760
Very nervous.

314
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:10,060
I was watched by so many people.

315
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:13,040
But I like this court.

316
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:16,300
There is still a long way to go to be a good professional player.

317
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:18,881
-   
 - Remember today's feeling.

318
00:23:18,881 --> 00:23:20,140
second round player.

319
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:21,840
Xing Xin Team's Bao Rongxing.

320
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,966
Everybody, wait to my triumphant return.

321
00:23:23,966 --> 00:23:25,760
 

322
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,620
He's really relaxed.
 

323
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:29,800
He has no idea what tension is.

324
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,940
What? Are you nervous?

325
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:33,300
How is that possible?

326
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:35,520
I can only make other people nervous.

327
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:38,626
They must be nervous after losing a game.

328
00:23:38,626 --> 00:23:41,240
Take advantage of this opportunity
to kill them in one fell swoop.

329
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:44,280
Xing Xin's Bao Zi, the Invader
versus Miricles' Baraka.

330
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:46,600
Ranger versus Elemental mage.

331
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:50,160
Both characters enters the map and game begins.

332
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:53,880
Stonehenge Map. Close combat.

333
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:58,160
If Ranger can replicate the beginning of Knight,
move near the Elemental Mage,

334
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:59,460
there will be great advantages.

335
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:03,200
But Baraka's Elemental Mage won't let the enemy get close to him easily.

336
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,240
We see Baraka's moving slowly.

337
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:06,420
Find a high spot.

338
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,521
He's spotted.

339
00:24:08,521 --> 00:24:09,680
Bao Zi, the Invader is spotted.

340
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:10,720
Baraka's gonna attack.

341
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:13,020
Nice move. Bao Zi, the
Invader reacts very quickly.

342
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:14,120
Magic missile missed him.

343
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,241
Change the route immediately.

344
00:24:15,241 --> 00:24:17,060
Baraka's attacking continuously.

345
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:18,520
He's consuming Bao Zi, the Invader's HP.

346
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:21,400
Now the Ranger is a little passive.

347
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:23,040
Very experienced. To avoid attack,

348
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,920
Bao Zi, the Invader run straight
into the Stonehenge.

349
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:27,720
This way, the Elemental Mage will find it
very difficult to find his place again.

350
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:29,160
Bao Zi, the Invader continues his strategy.

351
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:30,800
High-speed movement
using his characteristic of occupation.

352
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:32,600
He doesn't give Baraka a chance to locate himself.

353
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:35,360
Such a strategy can temporarily guarantee the safety of HP himself.

354
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:36,560
But if he wants to win the game,

355
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:39,700
he still needs to find an
oppirtunity to get close.

356
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:47,960
Such a good prejudge.

357
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:49,720
He's not a newcomer at all.

358
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:51,600
I was fooled.

359
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:05,000
Baraka adjusted the position.

360
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,620
Baraka is very cautious.

361
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:08,340
He chooses to stay outside Stonehenge.

362
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:10,500
It seems that he will not rush out.

363
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:13,000
Bao Zi, the Invader keeps moving.

364
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:19,280
Baraka found another high spot.

365
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:21,140
This position is very good for him.

366
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:22,920
He uses the skills.

367
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:28,040
What is Bao Zi doing? The Mage has jumped up.

368
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:35,381
Hit him. v

369
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:41,400
The HP of ranger is only 40%.

370
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:44,480
Elemental Mage's damage is considerable.

371
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:48,720
Baraka uses the skills continuously.

372
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:51,140
Bao Zi, the Invader is very passive.

373
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:54,860
Why is here all stone walls?

374
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:57,120
Bao Zi, the Invader's dodging is very strange.

375
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:59,840
It's not like a well planned route.

376
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:05,990
Baraka starts his attaking rhythm.

377
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:12,600
Bao Zi, the Invader will lose if he can't find the
opportunity to get close to him.

378
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:14,080
Good. Another attack.

379
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:15,780
Bao Zi, the Invader has
been suppressed compeltely.

380
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:17,200
Baraka has no pressure at all.

381
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:20,220
He's like shooting a moving stake.

382
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:37,501
We can see that Bao Zi has some difficulties.

383
00:26:37,501 --> 00:26:38,980
If he can't find a way out now

384
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:41,640
It's very likely to be
consumed to death like this.

385
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:42,760
God.

386
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:44,540
Did he get lost on the map?

387
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:49,080
I told him to make use of the geography carefully to avoid ranged attack.

388
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:51,880
Stone wall, for example, is a good choice.

389
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:53,080
A good choice?

390
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:55,780
This guy has no sense of direction.

391
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:58,320
Why is the road so hard to find?

392
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:02,480
Bao Zi, the Invader hasn't found the chance to get close to the Elemental Mage yet?

393
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,160
I observed his position carefully.

394
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:06,880
He seems to be circling around the same area of the map.

395
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,540
Is he lost?

396
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:09,600
Flame Explosion.

397
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:10,600
Hit him again.

398
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:12,520
Bao Zi, the Invader is acting amateur.

399
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:16,160
You turned out to be a rookie.

400
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:18,440
Bao Zi, the Invader is in danger.

401
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:22,980
HP is empty.

402
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:26,560
Miricle Team's Elemental Mage, Baraka won.

403
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:28,900
Luo Tian is the winner.

404
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:31,260
That's a bit unexpected.

405
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:32,260
Yeah.

406
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:35,260
As a professional player, Bao Rongxing still has a long way to go.

407
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:38,220
At least get familiar with the map first.

408
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,600
Sorry, boss.

409
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:47,960
It's too hard to find a way out there.

410
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:50,000
I got lost.

411
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:56,440
Sit.

412
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,640
The score is now two to zero.

413
00:27:58,640 --> 00:27:59,840
Xingxin Team lost two games.

414
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:02,900
If they lose another game, they'll probably be eliminated.

415
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:04,060
It's all right.

416
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:06,000
Let's just do our best.

417
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,080
You can leave it to the team.

418
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:13,120
Welcome Ye Qiu fron Xing Xin Team.

419
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,440
Don't worry.

420
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,840
We'll win.

421
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:21,620
And welcome Zhang Yiwei from Miracle Team.

422
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:30,500
Miracle, Miracle, Miracle.

423
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:32,900
Come on!

424
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:36,200
Boss is the best.

425
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:42,840
It's two to zero.

426
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:44,600
They must have broken down.

427
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:46,340
Let's go and take them down.

428
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:48,880
Good. Go for it, captain.

429
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:53,600
 ♫ I am an ordinary, but more than ordinary ♫ 

430
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:56,880
 ♫ I am at the summit, looking for another summit ♫

 ♫ We stand at the starry summit ♫ 

435
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:13,480
It's been half a year, the
master returns to the stage.

436
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:16,920
Whether he can become stronger is a topic of great concern to the public.

437
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:18,760
Whether he's getting stronger remains to be seen.

438
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:21,360
But one thing hasn't changed in nine years.

439
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:24,240
The master hasn't shown his face so far.

440
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,810
Yeah.

441
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:37,180
Dad.

442
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:38,920
The game starts at three o'clock.

443
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:40,600
Are you coming?

♫ ♫

445
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:49,180
After you get off the plane,
take a taxi to the gate two of the venue.

446
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:50,320
Come in and turn left.

447
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:52,720
Take the first entrance into the auditorium.

448
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:56,580
Third row in the middle, second seat to the left.

449
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:58,460
That's for you.

00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:21,860
He finally started to be himself.

458
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:32,700
Such a wasting of time. When will you guys grow up?

459
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:35,060
We agreed to become professional players together.

460
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:37,420
You want to be a professional player
by playing computer?

461
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:38,860
Haven't you recognize reality?

462
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:40,740
I don't know if I'll regret it in the future.

463
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:45,440
But now, I want to try my best.

464
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:50,240
Stay as my son or never come back.

465
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:53,040
From now on, you have
nothing to do with this family.

466
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:58,160
I hope you can come and see my game.

467
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:01,300
 ♫ We will meet again when the day comes ♫

 ♫ I have always been my own hero ♫ 

473
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:19,160
Xing Xin versus Miracle.

474
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:20,440
The third round of Individual Event.

475
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:22,740
The game will begin soon.

476
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:31,980
Okay, we are now looking
at the captain of Miracle Team,

477
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:33,640
ace player Zhang Yiwei.

478
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:37,400
Zhang Yiwei is well known as the first operator of Sharpshooter,
Cloud Piercer.

479
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:39,080
He has always been known for his quick response.

480
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:41,620
But today he is fighting to God of Fights.

481
00:31:41,620 --> 00:31:43,800
And Ye Qiu uses Freelancer.

482
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:46,520
As the first time in a formal competition,

483
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:49,780
Freelancer includes 24 full professional skills
in one of Glory.

484
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:50,840
The skills are complicated.

485
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:53,780
The operator needs to know every occupation very well.

486
00:31:53,780 --> 00:31:56,900
And skills need to be switched to the corresponding occupational weapons,

487
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:59,440
- hence the speed requirement is also very high.
- Okay.

488
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:05,280
Let's take a look
at what surprises Master Ye Qiu can bring to us.

489
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:08,280
Slide and Scoop. Jun Mo Xiao jumped and dodged.

490
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:10,720
Random Firing.

491
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,760
Freelancer has a fatal flaw.

492
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:15,140
Freelancer doesn't have high injury ultimate.

493
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:18,440
DPS is no match for a regular career.

494
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:20,000
It's easy to deal with you.

495
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,680
I ignore your DPS of small skills,

496
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:23,760
and then hit back with high DPS skills,

497
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:27,820
It won't be long
before the difference of our HP becomes apparent.

498
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:35,680
See? you're really fragile.

499
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:41,960
Jun Mo Xiao vanished
in Raging Flames' field of vision.

500
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,660
Where is he?

501
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:45,420
I hit him.

502
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:59,680
Is this a free fight?

503
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:03,500
Freelancer has 24 occupations
and 120 basic skills in total.

504
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:05,520
Jun Mo Xiao integrates all skills
across all occupations perfectly

505
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:08,160
relies on a thousand-machine umbrella.

506
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:11,640
In other words,
Jun Mo Xiao's skill will never stop.

507
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:13,960
That's amazing.

508
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:31,481
Last hit.

509
00:33:31,481 --> 00:33:34,020
Freelancer Jun Mo Xiao's infinite combos
killed Raging Flames.

510
00:33:34,020 --> 00:33:36,060
The winner is Ye Qiu.

511
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:37,681
He won.

512
00:33:37,681 --> 00:33:40,440
Master Ye Qiu returned to the Glory stage
with Freelancer.

513
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:43,760
A thousand-machine umbrella and Freelancer also opens up a new era of Glory.

514
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:45,880
This is the real Master Ye Qiu.

515
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:47,540
A real King's Avatar.

516
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:48,540
Congratulations to Ye Qiu.

517
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:50,440
Congratulations to Xing Xin for getting one point.

518
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:52,280
The Individual Event is over.

519
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,941
The points of Xing Xin and Miracle is one to two.

520
00:33:53,941 --> 00:33:57,000
Let's cheer together. We won. What are you doing?

521
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,160
Come on, come on.

522
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:59,720
Don't think that we're the only two people,

523
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:00,880
and we don't have the momentum.

524
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:03,220
Together, we can cover the whole age group.

525
00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:06,800
Come on, let's cheer together.
Let the master hear us.

526
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:10,600
Don't think you're too old to be passionate.

527
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:12,000
Glory is your time machine.

528
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,940
Go back to your youth, uncle.

529
00:34:23,693 --> 00:34:25,880
September 5th.

530
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:30,320
Guang won the game.

531
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:42,150
