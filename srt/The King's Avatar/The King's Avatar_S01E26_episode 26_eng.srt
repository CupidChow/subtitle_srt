 Subtitles and Timing provided to you by💥🍥 TEAM 7️⃣ 🍥💥 @viki.com 

25
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:57,100
I heard
that other companies will do team building.

26
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:58,500
Yes, team building.

27
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,678
Seems pretty good.

28
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,400
Hey, Jun Mo Xiao.

29
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,500
Welcome.

30
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:19,858
That's our office gym.

31
00:02:19,858 --> 00:02:23,018
You can do some exercise here
to take a break from training.

32
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,700
Those are massage chairs.

33
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:27,458
I like them.

34
00:02:29,578 --> 00:02:32,998
And here... we practice here.

35
00:02:33,838 --> 00:02:35,258
This is the power supply system.

36
00:02:35,258 --> 00:02:37,518
Don't touch it when some are in training,

37
00:02:37,518 --> 00:02:40,298
or all computers will shut off.

38
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,600
Remember?

39
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,318
Yes.

40
00:02:49,058 --> 00:02:51,800
This is where we keep our account cards.

41
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,800
You can put yours here.

42
00:02:56,818 --> 00:02:58,458
How careless!

43
00:02:58,458 --> 00:03:00,578
Someone puts my card of Jun Mo Xiao in it.

44
00:03:00,578 --> 00:03:01,840
In case it loses,

45
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,270
the greatest thousand-machine umbrella in Glory is nowhere to be found.

46
00:03:11,318 --> 00:03:12,700
Okay, that's it.

47
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:14,300
Feel free to look about.

48
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:15,838
Okay.

49
00:03:56,558 --> 00:03:58,378
You come after me,

50
00:03:58,378 --> 00:04:01,418
and that costs your weapon and account.

51
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:24,100
Wait, see the name.

52
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:28,400
Sullen Kitten?

53
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,058
You want the thousand-machine umbrella?

54
00:04:30,058 --> 00:04:34,100
Then there's a chance you can get it.

55
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:36,500
You can start a fight against anyone in our team,

56
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:38,100
equipping yourself with the umbrella.

57
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:40,600
If you win, it's yours.

58
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:44,100
I promise that I will no longer kill you.

59
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,400
Unfortunately, if you lose,

60
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:54,800
you have to go and surrender your card.

61
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,200
Okay.

62
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:04,400
How about him?

63
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,300
He's a Warlock.

64
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,100
You'd better find another person.

65
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:12,418
He's a Ninja,

66
00:05:12,418 --> 00:05:14,900
which means that he casts a skill,

67
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:18,100
and we're in close quarters. That's a bad option for me.

68
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:22,300
Well, your timing is perfect.

69
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:24,258
You need to think twice.

70
00:05:24,258 --> 00:05:28,798
If I'm defeated, the umbrella will be his.

71
00:05:30,498 --> 00:05:33,000
I'm convinced of your experience.

72
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,200
You can do a good job.

73
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:37,700
Well, I'll rekindle my spirit today.

74
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:40,900
I'll fight without equipment,

75
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:44,555
so he cannot blame it for the failure.

76
00:05:44,555 --> 00:05:46,300
 

77
00:06:09,278 --> 00:06:12,949
 

78
00:07:23,698 --> 00:07:26,058
 

79
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,900
Come on, cough up.

80
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:44,658
I'll take it.

81
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:49,500
How can I... lost my card?

82
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:53,000
You're a visionary.

83
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:57,300
Why so sure he must lose?

84
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,900
I was not certain
until he chose the umbrella as his weapon.

85
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:05,700
With that, our victory was guaranteed.

86
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:12,300
What?

87
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:16,078
Only Freelancers can use the umbrella and reach their full potential.

88
00:08:16,078 --> 00:08:20,678
For 23 other professions, it's a drag.

89
00:08:20,678 --> 00:08:26,938
Its various forms and strange weight
costed him the game.

90
00:08:26,938 --> 00:08:30,778
That's why Mo Fan lost nearly without fighting.

91
00:08:30,778 --> 00:08:36,498
You smug jerk fought with no weapon or equipment? How dare you!

92
00:08:36,498 --> 00:08:39,800
That's nothing.

93
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:42,100
Have you thought about why you made it?

94
00:08:42,898 --> 00:08:46,658
Talk about your extra skill points.

95
00:09:16,378 --> 00:09:18,955
After my father's death,

96
00:09:18,955 --> 00:09:21,766
I was accustomed to sit here on my own.

97
00:09:21,766 --> 00:09:25,950
♫♫

98
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,783
Those years,

99
00:09:33,378 --> 00:09:35,958
I had always been alone,

100
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:40,938
during meals, movies,

101
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:44,620
in the empty cafe,

102
00:09:47,715 --> 00:09:50,898
and the virtual world of Glory.

103
00:09:52,843 --> 00:09:57,780
When solitude becomes the norm, you would find the world beautiful yet unchanging.

104
00:09:59,006 --> 00:10:02,300
So we can't always be alone with ourselves.

105
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:04,900
We need company,

106
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:08,500
both online and offline.

107
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:11,600
We need to enrich our lives,

108
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,183
just like Glory,

109
00:10:14,183 --> 00:10:17,415
which started with one district but now has ten.

110
00:10:17,998 --> 00:10:20,789
This is life.

111
00:10:20,789 --> 00:10:23,206
We never stop exploring and evolving.

112
00:10:24,386 --> 00:10:27,600
 ♫ We go through deep and down ♫ 

113
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,900
 ♫ We stand at the starry summit ♫ 

114

 ♫ Now I finally understand what I used to be ♫

117
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,900
 ♫ I am an ordinary, but more than ordinary ♫ 

118
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:50,100
 ♫ I am at the summit, looking for another summit ♫ 

119
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:53,300
 ♫ We will meet again when the day comes ♫ 

120
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:56,489
 ♫ We are stronger than we used to be ♫ 

121
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:59,646
 ♫ We go through deep and down ♫ 

122
00:10:59,646 --> 00:11:02,926
 ♫ We stand at the starry summit ♫ 

123
00:11:02,926 --> 00:11:06,035
 ♫ Now I finally understand what I used to be ♫ 

124
00:11:06,035 --> 00:11:08,890
 ♫ I have always been my own hero ♫ 

125
00:11:11,628 --> 00:11:15,392
Was I really isolated when I lived a life like that?

126
00:11:21,378 --> 00:11:28,649
I used to laugh with others, and weep alone.

127
00:11:28,649 --> 00:11:31,198
Smile was my mask.

128
00:11:32,638 --> 00:11:34,858
Everything changed when I met them,

129
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:38,058
the guys playing Glory,

130
00:11:38,058 --> 00:11:44,358
They laugh, bicker, or cry, whenever they feel like doing that.

131
00:11:46,738 --> 00:11:52,418
Then I found that I was just relieved to show my true feelings.

132
00:11:54,058 --> 00:11:56,198
Isolation is good.

133
00:11:56,755 --> 00:12:00,320
But with friends, better.

134
00:12:05,098 --> 00:12:09,118
All I want is to take back my account card.

135
00:12:12,938 --> 00:12:16,498
You must first get in there.

136
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,658
You've never tried, so don't just give in.

137
00:12:22,526 --> 00:12:24,875
A small tip.

138
00:12:24,875 --> 00:12:28,300
Don't assume it's difficult to deal with them.

139
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:31,400
You just put your brain into gear, and be tough.

140
00:12:35,898 --> 00:12:38,026
I don't understand.

141
00:12:40,035 --> 00:12:45,758
You might find it a good team when you're dealing with them.

142
00:12:51,418 --> 00:12:53,058
I'm going to go now.

143
00:13:03,338 --> 00:13:05,820
 

144
00:13:10,598 --> 00:13:12,872
Do I need... friends?

145
00:13:23,158 --> 00:13:25,258
Our match against Jia Shi is coming.

146
00:13:25,258 --> 00:13:27,738
We must win.

147
00:13:27,738 --> 00:13:30,120
I'll take the lead on analyzing our opponents,

148
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:32,270
and mapping out plans.

149
00:13:32,278 --> 00:13:36,490
Meanwhile, we must prepare for the match by obtaining better equipment.

150
00:13:48,138 --> 00:13:50,198
Stop, that's it!

151
00:13:50,198 --> 00:13:54,818
If you kill this mob in just 90 seconds, a skill book will drop from it.

152
00:14:11,598 --> 00:14:12,519
 

153
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:14,355
 

154
00:14:14,355 --> 00:14:17,189
It's amazing. I thought the drop rate is random.

155
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:19,158
Turns out there's a pattern.

156
00:14:19,158 --> 00:14:23,998
After all, as an experienced player, I need some unique skills.

157
00:14:23,998 --> 00:14:25,618
I'll make a strategy guide

158
00:14:25,618 --> 00:14:28,915
to help all our teammates get the maximum skill points,

159
00:14:28,915 --> 00:14:30,735
and ace Jia Shi in no time.

160
00:14:30,735 --> 00:14:32,838
Great.

161
00:14:32,838 --> 00:14:35,530
Stop showing your adoration.

162
00:14:47,418 --> 00:14:51,998
This is the boss that we have to kill before we make it to the next.

163
00:14:51,998 --> 00:14:56,738
It might take... 32 minutes and 28 seconds.

164
00:14:56,738 --> 00:14:58,538
Is time enough?

165
00:14:58,538 --> 00:15:00,718
115 342

166
00:15:03,418 --> 00:15:05,978
I thought he had left.

167
00:15:05,978 --> 00:15:07,878
What did he say?

168
00:15:07,878 --> 00:15:10,078
It locates a secret path.

169
00:15:23,715 --> 00:15:25,806
We've got around the boss,

170
00:15:26,698 --> 00:15:28,312
which cuts the time by 29 minutes.

171
00:15:28,312 --> 00:15:30,598
You made it.

172
00:15:30,598 --> 00:15:33,466
As the most notorious scrap picker,

173
00:15:33,466 --> 00:15:36,098
you know the map very well.

174
00:15:36,098 --> 00:15:39,398
Perhaps... I could help them write the guide.

175
00:15:39,398 --> 00:15:41,898
And... in exchange
 

176
00:15:41,898 --> 00:15:43,192
I'll have my account card.

177
00:15:43,192 --> 00:15:46,278
785 013

178
00:15:47,858 --> 00:15:51,649
463 042

179
00:16:02,298 --> 00:16:03,738
Here...

180
00:16:09,678 --> 00:16:12,766
 

181
00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:30,083
 

182
00:16:31,798 --> 00:16:33,478
You see?

183
00:16:34,478 --> 00:16:37,338
Great. Have a rest.

184
00:16:41,698 --> 00:16:44,629
Skill books can increase
the max SP of professions.

185
00:16:44,629 --> 00:16:48,258
And one skill book raises that by 10 points.

186
00:16:48,258 --> 00:16:50,738
But the low drop rate of skill books means

187
00:16:50,738 --> 00:16:52,378
you're trying your luck to get one.

188
00:16:52,378 --> 00:16:58,458
I built a new mathematical model to calculate how to raise the rate.

189
00:17:05,566 --> 00:17:07,603
What are you whispering, kid?

190
00:17:07,603 --> 00:17:09,223
- It's useful.
- Nothing.

191
00:17:09,223 --> 00:17:11,815
I wasn't as worthless as you said.

192
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:40,499
For Team Xing Xin, the guide is crucial for victory.

193
00:17:40,499 --> 00:17:43,618
For me, it's freedom.

194
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,938
I've been looking for you.

195
00:17:48,938 --> 00:17:52,003
For me? What's wrong?

196
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:05,398
You look pale.

197
00:18:06,023 --> 00:18:07,410
Am I?

198
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:17,486
Is it because of the guide?

199
00:18:22,678 --> 00:18:25,226
Actually, I...

200
00:18:25,226 --> 00:18:26,938
I understand.

201
00:18:26,938 --> 00:18:29,958
You don't fancy joining us.

202
00:18:29,958 --> 00:18:33,726
And I'm not going to force you to do so. So don't be tense.

203
00:18:35,063 --> 00:18:36,578
Look at this.

204
00:18:37,432 --> 00:18:41,918
I make the tea especially for you. It can invigorate you.

205
00:18:43,558 --> 00:18:46,386
Thank you... for pulling all nighters with us for six days.

206
00:18:46,386 --> 00:18:49,589
You guys... have made the impossible possible.

207
00:18:56,998 --> 00:18:59,269
Seems the flowers have died.

208
00:18:59,269 --> 00:19:02,438
Well, drink it while it's hot. The effects will be better.

209
00:19:08,309 --> 00:19:11,798
Don't look at me. Drink it.

210
00:19:16,369 --> 00:19:19,799
Why... why do you drink this?

211
00:19:19,799 --> 00:19:22,678
This one.

212
00:19:25,878 --> 00:19:28,815
Well, you go on with your work, I'm leaving. See you.

213
00:19:39,018 --> 00:19:42,838
They are... very nice to me.

214
00:19:42,838 --> 00:19:45,338
Should I have the guide to myself?

215
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:54,858
Captain...

216
00:19:54,858 --> 00:19:58,195
Mo Fan, we decide to name the guide

217
00:19:58,195 --> 00:20:01,618
"The Scroll of Teaching" for your outstanding contribution.

218
00:20:01,618 --> 00:20:03,698
- How about it?
- That sounds good.

219
00:20:03,698 --> 00:20:05,138
Deception...

220
00:20:05,138 --> 00:20:08,758
and his work... "The Scroll of Teaching".

221
00:20:09,738 --> 00:20:12,178
Hey guys, boss's going to treat us to dinner.

222
00:20:12,178 --> 00:20:13,938
Big meals!

223
00:20:13,938 --> 00:20:16,138
Let's go.

224
00:20:18,118 --> 00:20:21,729
Boss... I've expecting so long... for your treat.

225
00:20:26,403 --> 00:20:28,766
I didn't...

226
00:20:53,858 --> 00:20:55,486
Are you blind?

227
00:20:55,486 --> 00:20:57,838
Ah, it's you.

228
00:20:57,838 --> 00:21:01,038
I guess you're a dishwasher here?

229
00:21:03,558 --> 00:21:06,498
Wait, you must say sorry.

230
00:21:06,498 --> 00:21:10,235
I just remembered... you're dumb.

231
00:21:10,235 --> 00:21:15,495
Well, then you remove the oil stain... right now.

232
00:21:15,495 --> 00:21:18,098
Hey, Liu,

233
00:21:18,803 --> 00:21:20,389
come here.

234
00:21:21,829 --> 00:21:23,658
Manager, I'm coming.

235
00:21:42,255 --> 00:21:44,175
Ready?

236
00:21:44,778 --> 00:21:47,078
This is Li, my niece.

237
00:21:47,078 --> 00:21:48,492
- Hi. Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

238
00:21:48,492 --> 00:21:51,969
Li, this is Liu, who I often told you about.

239
00:21:51,969 --> 00:21:56,418
He's generous in everyday life, and is responsible in the workplace.

240
00:21:56,418 --> 00:21:58,949
Manager helps me a lot.

241
00:21:58,949 --> 00:22:01,938
And to top it off, he never plays the field.

242
00:22:05,543 --> 00:22:08,158
Would you excuse me. I got to take this.

243
00:22:08,158 --> 00:22:09,812
Sure.

244
00:22:12,938 --> 00:22:14,698
MT, initiate.

245
00:22:14,698 --> 00:22:16,618
Lure the enemy, and pull aggro.

246
00:22:16,618 --> 00:22:18,078
Got it.

247
00:22:23,438 --> 00:22:25,298
Hello.

248
00:22:25,298 --> 00:22:28,898
Yes, I'll pay the same price for your coffee beans.

249
00:22:28,898 --> 00:22:31,223
I don't care the quality.

250
00:22:31,223 --> 00:22:33,678
Anyway, they will be mixed and sold.

251
00:22:38,595 --> 00:22:40,298
Are you blind...

252
00:22:48,469 --> 00:22:50,858
Do I need to apologize for it?

253
00:22:52,218 --> 00:22:54,259
I failed to hold aggro, OT is needed.

254
00:22:54,259 --> 00:22:55,318
OT, enter.

255
00:22:55,318 --> 00:22:57,038
Lay low, and watch your positioning.

256
00:22:57,038 --> 00:22:58,778
Got it.

257
00:23:03,218 --> 00:23:04,618
Excuse me, miss.

258
00:23:04,618 --> 00:23:07,838
We're seeking pretty ladies, and giving them presents.

259
00:23:07,838 --> 00:23:09,783
You're the most beautiful one. Congratulations!

260
00:23:09,783 --> 00:23:11,292
Me?

261
00:23:11,292 --> 00:23:13,638
We have an fine gift for you.

262
00:23:13,638 --> 00:23:17,146
- Please come with me and take it.
- Okay.

263
00:23:17,146 --> 00:23:18,758
This way, please.

264
00:23:21,058 --> 00:23:23,420
Miss, this way.

265
00:23:26,418 --> 00:23:29,038
- You come with your girlfriend?
- No, no. Of course no.

266
00:23:29,038 --> 00:23:32,060
Those are my uncle and cousin.

267
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:33,858
Well, cousin.

268
00:23:33,858 --> 00:23:36,258
Threat generation is enough.

269
00:23:36,258 --> 00:23:37,738
Now it's time to attack.

270
00:23:37,738 --> 00:23:39,438
Carry, control your DPS.

271
00:23:39,438 --> 00:23:42,178
- Don't pull aggro off him. 
 - Got it.

272
00:23:45,935 --> 00:23:47,578
Manager Liao?

273
00:23:47,578 --> 00:23:49,918
It's you, Manager Liao.

274
00:23:50,778 --> 00:23:53,126
- Who are you? 
 - I'm Wei.

275
00:23:53,126 --> 00:23:54,835
You don't remember?

276
00:23:54,835 --> 00:23:56,415
Liu and me, we are good friends.

277
00:23:56,415 --> 00:23:59,223
I sell coffee beans.

278
00:23:59,223 --> 00:24:01,218
Nice to meet you.

279
00:24:01,218 --> 00:24:02,658
How about my beans?

280
00:24:02,658 --> 00:24:04,238
What?

281
00:24:04,895 --> 00:24:08,578
Although they're not good, they are really cheap.

282
00:24:08,578 --> 00:24:14,019
It's profitable when you blend mine and yours.

283
00:24:14,019 --> 00:24:15,215
Blend?

284
00:24:15,215 --> 00:24:17,318
I've worked with Liu for years,

285
00:24:17,318 --> 00:24:21,318
and have made a big fortune with just one firm.

286
00:24:21,318 --> 00:24:23,203
If we two join hands...

287
00:24:23,203 --> 00:24:24,398
No.

288
00:24:24,398 --> 00:24:25,798
Get away.

289
00:24:31,698 --> 00:24:34,299
I'm out of combat. Attack done.

290
00:24:45,138 --> 00:24:47,058
Ghost, give him a Game Over.

291
00:24:48,338 --> 00:24:50,298
An Wen Yi.

292
00:24:50,298 --> 00:24:53,198
Have you put enough pickled chillies sauce?

293
00:24:53,198 --> 00:24:54,458
Don't worry.

294
00:24:54,458 --> 00:24:58,838
Spice-laden Sichuan capsicum frutescens, I put a spoonful of that.

295
00:25:03,918 --> 00:25:06,298
Mister, here you are.

296
00:25:08,238 --> 00:25:11,638
That lady offers you this.

297
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:19,338
And...

298
00:25:19,338 --> 00:25:23,158
this one is for your uncle, and this for your cousin.

299
00:25:23,158 --> 00:25:25,223
- Enjoy.
- What?

300
00:25:26,872 --> 00:25:29,052
- What's your problem?
- I'm so sorry.

301
00:25:29,052 --> 00:25:31,338
- What the hell.
- I'm sorry, manager.

302
00:25:35,138 --> 00:25:37,298
We always have a good talk.

303
00:25:37,298 --> 00:25:39,090
We've had fun, and eaten tasty food,

304
00:25:39,090 --> 00:25:40,730
so it's time to focus on training.

305
00:25:40,738 --> 00:25:42,660
Wait for me!

306
00:25:43,238 --> 00:25:44,460
Be careful.

307
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:46,080
What?

308
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:47,638
You rock.

309
00:25:55,878 --> 00:25:59,166
I guess you want to talk with me.

310
00:26:03,618 --> 00:26:05,358
Here. Take it back.

311
00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:12,655
No tricks this time.

312
00:26:12,655 --> 00:26:14,278
Just take it.

313
00:26:17,778 --> 00:26:22,298
 ♫ You are as always ♫ 

314
00:26:22,298 --> 00:26:26,338
It's of a lot of fun to have your teammates to play Glory together.

315
00:26:26,338 --> 00:26:28,978
But being a loner is also a nice option.

316
00:26:29,678 --> 00:26:35,103
Whether you join us or not, whoever you'll be,

317
00:26:37,038 --> 00:26:41,438
hopefully, we'll get to play Glory together.

318
00:26:43,138 --> 00:26:46,538
It's a lovely day because of you.

319
00:26:49,698 --> 00:26:53,538
 ♫ Keep calm even though I have to leave, ♫ 

320
00:26:53,538 --> 00:26:56,186
You've never tried. How can you be so sure?

321
00:26:56,186 --> 00:26:57,858
I made the tea especially for you.

322
00:26:57,858 --> 00:27:00,015
It can invigorate you.

323
00:27:00,015 --> 00:27:01,243
Don't look at me.

324
00:27:01,243 --> 00:27:02,638
Drink it.

325
00:27:02,638 --> 00:27:04,098
We decide to name the guide

326
00:27:04,098 --> 00:27:07,618
"The Scroll of Teaching" for your outstanding contribution.

327
00:27:07,618 --> 00:27:08,738
How about it?

328
00:27:08,738 --> 00:27:13,795
Whether you join Team Xing Xin or not, whoever you'll be,

329
00:27:16,298 --> 00:27:20,640
hopefully, we'll get to play Glory together.

330
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:23,672
 ♫ We go through deep and down ♫ 

331
00:27:23,672 --> 00:27:27,038
 ♫ We stand at the starry summit ♫ 

332
00:27:28,818 --> 00:27:32,992
I never thought I'd be so happy... to be with others.

333
00:27:32,992 --> 00:27:36,298
I want to befriend them.

334
00:27:36,298 --> 00:27:38,158
I want to be one of the team.

335
00:27:42,458 --> 00:27:51,418
 ♫ I have seen before The legend ♫ 

336
00:27:56,858 --> 00:27:59,258
I can't find the guide.

337
00:27:59,258 --> 00:28:03,398
Luo Ji, have you made a backup?

338
00:28:04,515 --> 00:28:07,523
- What? 
 - The guide.

339
00:28:07,523 --> 00:28:09,006
No, I haven't.

340
00:28:09,006 --> 00:28:11,283
I thought it's on the computer.

341
00:28:11,283 --> 00:28:12,738
We're done for...

342
00:28:12,738 --> 00:28:14,720
Come and find it.

343
00:28:20,698 --> 00:28:22,798
It's... gone.

344
00:28:27,543 --> 00:28:30,240
I... I feel like I saw Mo Fan.

345
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:33,315
Wait.

346
00:28:39,075 --> 00:28:41,658
It's mine, don't do that.

347
00:28:43,438 --> 00:28:44,678
It's mine.

348
00:28:44,678 --> 00:28:47,660
Stop, stop, what are you doing?

349
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:51,306
It's mine! You don't take it.

350
00:29:40,418 --> 00:29:42,852
You are here. You hungry?

351
00:29:44,638 --> 00:29:46,318
No?

352
00:29:47,086 --> 00:29:49,258
Uhh... I'm a little bit hungry.

353
00:29:49,258 --> 00:29:52,089
Bao Zi, how about you?

354
00:29:52,089 --> 00:29:56,292
Uhh... I want to eat something, and collect a package.

355
00:29:56,292 --> 00:29:58,198
I just get this craving for some sunlight...

356
00:29:58,198 --> 00:30:00,118
to help my body absorb calcium.

357
00:30:07,783 --> 00:30:10,378
Take some food before you go sunbathing.

358
00:30:10,378 --> 00:30:13,152
How about Chinese steamed pork buns?

359
00:30:34,038 --> 00:30:35,578
Hi...

360
00:30:38,318 --> 00:30:40,958
We'll face Jia Shi in the
next match, need to be ready.

361
00:30:40,958 --> 00:30:43,340
I wonder about their players and roles.

362
00:30:45,358 --> 00:30:47,478
I'm going to do some research...

363
00:31:10,458 --> 00:31:12,558
 

364
00:31:12,558 --> 00:31:16,380
 

365
00:31:18,938 --> 00:31:21,058
Surprise!

366
00:31:24,778 --> 00:31:25,806
Welcome to Team Xing Xin.

367
00:31:25,806 --> 00:31:26,778
Welcome.

368
00:31:26,778 --> 00:31:27,918
Welcome.

369
00:31:27,918 --> 00:31:29,458
Welcome.

370
00:31:31,969 --> 00:31:33,618
Thank...

371
00:31:38,023 --> 00:31:41,218
Be gentle next time.

372
00:31:45,218 --> 00:31:50,090
 

373
00:31:51,844 --> 00:31:55,960
 

374
00:32:00,738 --> 00:32:01,818
When the battle starts,

375
00:32:01,818 --> 00:32:05,918
you guys move to find appropriate positions, leaving me and Ye Qiu alone.

376
00:32:05,918 --> 00:32:08,498
Zhang Jia Xing, you'd first go to support others.

377
00:32:08,498 --> 00:32:11,498
I must obliterate Jun Mo Xiao in the first seven minutes.

378
00:32:11,498 --> 00:32:13,255
Yes, captain.

379
00:32:14,458 --> 00:32:16,598
There are other players except for Jun Mo Xiao.

380
00:32:16,598 --> 00:32:20,003
What if they kill our Cleric at the very beginning?

381
00:32:20,003 --> 00:32:23,478
Four versus four, you are close competitors.

382
00:32:23,478 --> 00:32:25,912
When Jun Mo Xiao is out,

383
00:32:25,912 --> 00:32:29,798
the remaining players in Team Xing Xin, are literally at the mercy of us.

384
00:32:29,798 --> 00:32:32,403
What if Jun Mo Xiao rejects your offer of single combat?

385
00:32:32,403 --> 00:32:35,630
Su Mu Cheng, I'm the captain.

386
00:32:36,329 --> 00:32:39,858
To ask him to fight a duel, and to defeat him, is not your concern.

387
00:32:39,858 --> 00:32:43,398
What you should care is whether you're an effective Launcher.

388
00:32:43,398 --> 00:32:45,043
More importantly,

389
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:51,758
did you also contest Ye Qiu in the same way?

390
00:32:53,946 --> 00:32:58,718
At least when he was the captain, he'd always put aside the personal

391
00:32:58,766 --> 00:33:00,603
when playing team sports.

392
00:33:04,178 --> 00:33:07,538
You don't understand? He has it in for our team.

393
00:33:07,538 --> 00:33:10,898
A player of his age doesn't have to make a comeback.

394
00:33:10,898 --> 00:33:16,320
But he builds a team in the cafe before ours,

395
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:19,509
which is intended to humiliate me and our team.

396
00:33:19,509 --> 00:33:23,158
Do you think he would let us off the hook

397
00:33:23,158 --> 00:33:26,538
after we stole his Leaf of Autumn?

398
00:33:26,538 --> 00:33:31,678
Will you acknowledge me as your captain if we're beaten?

399
00:33:36,178 --> 00:33:39,418
Captain, there might be some misunderstandings.

400
00:33:39,418 --> 00:33:42,598
Ye Qiu is a professional player, who is committed to the game.

401
00:33:42,598 --> 00:33:45,223
He resumes his career because of his love for Glory

402
00:33:45,223 --> 00:33:46,778
and for every moment during the matches.

403
00:33:46,778 --> 00:33:49,738
Team Jia Shi, to him, is no more than an opponent.

404
00:33:49,738 --> 00:33:52,658
We are basically as ordinary as any and every team that

405
00:33:52,658 --> 00:33:54,218
he has ever triumphed over before.

406
00:33:54,218 --> 00:33:58,458
The only difference is that we are more competitive.

407
00:33:58,458 --> 00:34:03,266
So he must be more serious and proactive to raise his readiness.

408
00:34:07,538 --> 00:34:09,218
Go for it, guys.

409
00:34:09,218 --> 00:34:11,178
I'm going to get to practice.

410
00:34:16,498 --> 00:34:18,578
Me too.

411
00:34:23,778 --> 00:34:27,698
I'll take it as a yes
now that nobody else raises more questions.

412
00:34:27,698 --> 00:34:31,118
Do you take notes and remember our tactics?

413
00:34:35,398 --> 00:34:37,818
Of course yes.

414
00:34:37,818 --> 00:34:40,258
I agree with Captain Sun.

415
00:34:40,258 --> 00:34:41,429
I have an idea.

416
00:34:41,429 --> 00:34:43,818
You and I lead two teams to battle.

417
00:34:43,818 --> 00:34:46,258
So everyone in the team knows your tactics better.

418
00:34:46,258 --> 00:34:47,938
A good point.

419
00:35:46,206 --> 00:35:49,718
Last time, you dodged my Dragon Head Raising.

420
00:35:50,618 --> 00:35:54,183
Today I'm gonna show you how amazing it is.

421
00:36:04,698 --> 00:36:06,198
I won.

422
00:36:12,538 --> 00:36:14,118
Did you?

423
00:36:21,438 --> 00:36:24,266
Okay, let's call it a day.

424
00:36:44,338 --> 00:36:46,958
You did cast the Dragon Head Raising,

425
00:36:46,958 --> 00:36:49,615
but you still lost the game.

426
00:36:49,615 --> 00:36:53,458
Do you think your version
of Leaf of Autumn like that can be recognized?

427
00:36:58,498 --> 00:37:00,378
What on earth did you mean?

428
00:37:01,463 --> 00:37:06,618
To be frank,
Leaf of Autumn merely represents an account card.

429
00:37:06,618 --> 00:37:10,795
What people celebrate is not the roles in Glory.

430
00:37:10,795 --> 00:37:13,978
Instead, they cheer for the player behind, who wins the title,

431
00:37:13,978 --> 00:37:16,438
and presents the real Glory to them.

432
00:37:17,315 --> 00:37:19,680
You always want to show us
the so-called Dragon Head Raising.

433
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:24,758
But that's only a tool someone used
in order to succeed.

434
00:37:24,758 --> 00:37:26,858
Ye Qiu was that someone.

435
00:37:26,858 --> 00:37:29,058
Now it's you.

436
00:37:29,918 --> 00:37:31,498
Sun Xiang,

437
00:37:35,018 --> 00:37:37,578
if you really think you're much better,

438
00:37:37,578 --> 00:37:44,058
then you have to make a case for it
by leading us to prevail against not only him,

439
00:37:44,058 --> 00:37:46,098
but also other teams.

440
00:37:50,069 --> 00:37:54,978
So what we need to do
is to focus on training and matches.

441
00:37:54,978 --> 00:38:00,538
Jun Mo Xiao or Team Xing Xin
deserves a little attention

442
00:38:00,538 --> 00:38:02,578
if we're championship-oriented.

443
00:38:05,463 --> 00:38:08,738
Okay now, Captain Sun, have a good rest.

444
00:38:08,738 --> 00:38:10,378
See you.

445
00:38:20,098 --> 00:38:22,240
Why are you eating here?

446
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:24,178
Because food is not allowed there.

447
00:38:26,652 --> 00:38:30,186
I think it's a pretty big ask
to take Jia Shi forward.

448
00:38:31,178 --> 00:38:34,915
You're right, we've got a formidable competitor.

449
00:38:34,915 --> 00:38:39,318
And Ye Qiu's impact on us is huge. 
    

450
00:38:39,318 --> 00:38:42,620
It's hard for our teammates
to be comfortable with the forthcoming battle.

451
00:38:45,058 --> 00:38:48,189
Captain, the information
of Dragon Head Raising has been...

452
00:38:52,858 --> 00:38:56,338
Wait, sit.

453
00:38:56,338 --> 00:38:58,118
I want to talk with you.

454
00:39:07,783 --> 00:39:09,966
Seems you've been working hard on this.

455
00:39:09,966 --> 00:39:11,860
Can I...

456
00:39:17,738 --> 00:39:19,932
 

457
00:39:19,932 --> 00:39:22,098
I saw you here multiple times.

458
00:39:22,098 --> 00:39:26,000
- Are you seeking Captain Sun?
- No, I'm not.

459
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:31,878
You offer to investigate the Dragon Head Raising and Ye Qiu?

460
00:39:35,218 --> 00:39:37,823
How's the guild going?

461
00:39:37,823 --> 00:39:41,432
Good, and quite busy.

462
00:39:41,432 --> 00:39:44,058
Is there anything else wrong with it?

463
00:39:44,058 --> 00:39:46,340
If not, would you excuse me?

464
00:39:46,340 --> 00:39:48,995
Do you still want to join Jia Shi's Team 1?

465
00:39:54,263 --> 00:39:56,986
Praisage matters a lot to our team.

466
00:39:57,978 --> 00:40:03,300
Without your assistance, we'll be short of materials and supplies.

467
00:40:06,149 --> 00:40:07,692
However,

468
00:40:11,378 --> 00:40:14,658
if you try to overreach yourself, intervening in team affairs,

469
00:40:14,658 --> 00:40:16,698
and causing divisions,

470
00:40:16,698 --> 00:40:20,849
I won't hesitate to send you packing.

471
00:40:23,378 --> 00:40:27,598
Chen, you've doing a good job as a guild master.

472
00:40:28,818 --> 00:40:32,078
These do nothing for you.
 

473
00:40:34,858 --> 00:40:37,618
You'd better concentrate on your own work.

474
00:40:40,718 --> 00:40:45,506
 

475
00:40:54,858 --> 00:40:56,618
Have you maximized your SP?

476
00:40:56,618 --> 00:40:58,200
Yes.

477
00:41:01,318 --> 00:41:03,235
How do we celebrate our victory?

478
00:41:04,618 --> 00:41:08,438
Mo Fan, are you ready?

479
00:41:08,438 --> 00:41:11,018
The killing rate is above 96 per cent.

480
00:41:12,218 --> 00:41:13,760
Are you well-equipped?

481
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:16,129
Of course yes.

482
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:20,303
Okay, then let's go.
