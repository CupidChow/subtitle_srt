- Go!

116
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:15,810
Hmm!

117
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:18,540
Pai, don't make fun of me.

118
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:21,110
Sorry. I'll stop.

119
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:22,770
I'll stop, too.

120
00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:43,570
What's your next move?

121
00:08:45,210 --> 00:08:46,510
I don't know.

122
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:50,140
Do you think he can be trusted?

123
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:53,020
I firmly trust him,

124
00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:57,720
and I don't want to lose anyone
who values and cares about me again.

125

Hello?

126

127
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:22,740
Yeah, I'll go, of course.

Why did you tease my friend?

136
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,440
I didn't.

137
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:02,840
Be honest.
How serious are you gonna get with him?

138
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,440
I'm serious.

139
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,560

140

141
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,720
The one that I want him
to believe is Nom Jued.

142
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:18,680
You know that he's very naive, right?

143
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:20,600
I do.

144
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,120
He's so innocent that

145
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,200
I don't know how he survived high school.

146
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,640
Yeah, I know.

147
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:29,920
More importantly,

148
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,160
he's very sensitive about this.

149
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,120
I can take time,

150
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
learning about him

151
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,640
and taking a step at a time.

152
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,160
Are you sure?

153
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:49,920
Yes, I am.

154
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,200
Allow me to ask you one final time.

155
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,480
Are you sure that Nom Jued is the one?

156
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:58,680
Mm.

157
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,560
I'm gonna try my hardest

158
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:02,960
to be with him.

159

Fancy meeting you here.

163

166
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,990
- Oh?
- What are you doing here?

167
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:52,640
The professor is taking attendance.

168
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:54,930
- But Nom...
- Hurry up!

169
00:11:56,190 --> 00:11:57,060
Uh...

170
00:11:57,230 --> 00:11:58,230
Let's go!

171
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:02,000
Why are you avoiding me
when I finally stopped running?

172
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,330
Thank you, Somchat.

173
00:12:15,830 --> 00:12:17,670
Your mom taught you
to bow down to say thank you?

174
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:22,470
Phra Aek!

175
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:24,800
Phra Aek.

176
00:12:26,530 --> 00:12:27,730
It's actually you.

177
00:12:29,770 --> 00:12:31,500
Yeah, stop calling my name already.

178
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:35,630
Are you okay?

179
00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:37,830
Take a seat.

180
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:39,570
Here.

181
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:44,770
Are you hurt?

182
00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:46,830
Go and sit there.

183
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:48,670
There.

184
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:55,870
Phra Aek.

185
00:12:57,070 --> 00:12:58,830
I don't wanna have this feeling again.

186
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:00,460
Don't ignore me, please.

00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:21,970
Huh?

191
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:23,390
Leave.

192
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:24,800
- Huh?
- Take a photo?

193
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:26,230
Leave!

194
00:13:26,530 --> 00:13:28,730
- I told you to leave!
- Here?

195
00:13:28,770 --> 00:13:30,330
Fucking leave!

196
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:31,530
Leave?

197
00:13:47,330 --> 00:13:49,100
I don't want you to walk away from me.

198
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,870
I still wanna see you.

199
00:13:52,170 --> 00:13:54,200
I wanna know how you're doing.

200
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,630
What Phrab and Pai said was true.

201
00:13:56,930 --> 00:13:59,200
They told me that it's love.

202
00:14:01,170 --> 00:14:02,630
So this means that

203
00:14:03,330 --> 00:14:04,930
I love you, Phra Aek.

204
00:14:09,930 --> 00:14:11,600
Do you believe in what they said?

205
00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:15,000
I do.

206
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:17,100
It's because

207
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,200
what they said

208
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
was true.

209
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:24,530
Why is that?

210
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:26,870
I don't know.

211
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,130
I just feel that

212
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:34,630
the feelings I'm having are true.

213
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:41,130
I've already told you that

214
00:14:42,170 --> 00:14:44,970
I won't say sorry for kissing you, right?

215
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,030
It's because I meant to do it,

216
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:50,340
and it

217
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:52,930
carries all of my feelings toward you.

218
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,600
I'm flustered.

219
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:59,230
I know.

220
00:15:00,530 --> 00:15:04,430
I just wanna give us time to
get to know each other,

221
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:08,570
slowly learning about each other's feelings.

222
00:15:11,230 --> 00:15:13,000
If you think you're ready for this ride,

223
00:15:16,630 --> 00:15:18,100
then all you need to do is hold my hands.

224
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:26,900
Thank you so much, Phra Aek.

225
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:32,300
I'm thirsty again.

226
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,400
Are you?

227
00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:36,900
Give me a moment.

228
00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:44,030
Here.

229
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:47,270
You don't have to play along, you know?

230
00:15:47,970 --> 00:15:50,830
I know that you hate plain milk.

231
00:15:52,070 --> 00:15:53,470
I don't think this drink will satisfy me,

232
00:15:56,270 --> 00:15:57,600
but these might.

233
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,730
You can't do that here.

234
00:16:04,070 --> 00:16:05,470
It's fine at other places, right?

235
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:19,280
It's just the two of us now.

236
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:21,220
This means I can taste your lips, right?

237
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:24,140
Mm.

238
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:28,940
Ready?

239
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:32,260
I'm ready.

240
00:16:57,940 --> 00:17:00,380
Phra Aek! You're such a tease!

241
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:02,540
It's because you're goofy.

242
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:04,940
You never stop teasing me.

243
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:09,540
Don't you know that men like to tease
someone they're into?

244
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:13,020
We aren't kids now.

245
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:15,380
Next time, just tell me

246
00:17:15,819 --> 00:17:17,740
so it doesn't feel humiliating.

247
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,640
Righto.

248
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:21,599
I'll stop teasing you.

249
00:17:22,619 --> 00:17:23,619
Having said that,

250
00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:26,079
I'm doing it for real now.

251
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:29,520
Mm.

252
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:33,600
Can I taste those lips?

253
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:14,360
I can assure you
that I've never hated you, Phra Aek.

254
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:18,920
Righto,

255
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,360
Jued.

256
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:20,960
Sorry.

257
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:25,080
Righto, Nom Jued.

258
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:02,000
What the hell is wrong with you?

259
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,440
Why didn't you answer my text?

260
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:06,680
It's nice that you're here.

261
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:11,000
I think we should call it here.

262
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:15,280
Why?

263
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,640
If you still want to have fun with others,

264
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:19,680
then don't date me.

265
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:23,160
I'm possessive and emotionally sensitive.

266
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:25,200
I get upset at almost everything.

267
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,120
I don't know what's wrong with me.

268
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:30,680
I'm sorry.

269
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:35,960
I had no clue that I made you feel that way.

270
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:38,240
Why?

271
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,840
What you did was dance with a man.

272
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,000
And that guy...

273
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:49,000
Come on!

274
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:50,360
He's my friend.

275
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:52,320
So?

276
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,040
My girly friend.

277
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:57,720
Your girly friend?

278
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,600
Where are you going, Yingyam?

279
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:13,740
God, what's up with your friend, sis?

280
00:20:14,910 --> 00:20:15,750
I don't know.

281
00:20:16,890 --> 00:20:19,090
She can't tell that I'm not a guy?

282
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:23,960
Anyway, I'm so sorry

283
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:26,470
for making you feel uncomfortable.

284
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:30,920
I'm sorry

285
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:33,480
for thinking that you're that type of girl.

286
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:36,280
Let's...

287
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:38,360
Let's start over, okay?

288
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:42,080
Just tell me what you are
and are not okay with.

289
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:43,840
Mm.

290
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,280
- I'm sorry.
- Mm.

291
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:07,280
- Oh, you're finally here.
- Pai?

292
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:11,360
You're still drinking even if
the exam is around the corner?

293
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,080
It's been stressful, you know?

294
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:16,400
That's why we need to find a way to ease that.

295
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:19,520
- Cheers.
- Sure.

296
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:21,080
And... Cheers.

297
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:28,440
We aren't done with
what happened on that day.

298
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:30,480
How come you showed up by my college?

299
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:32,600
Yeah.

300
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,800
You got beef with Phra Rong?

301
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:36,480
It's nothing.

302
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:38,960
I just ended up there.

303
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:41,320
Let's continue drinking already.

304
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:42,780
Alright.

305
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:51,760
I've got no problem with you
being close to him.

306
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:53,920
He's a cool brother.

307
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:57,480
Yeah, the closer you are, the better.

308
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:59,000
His friends are so sweet.

309
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,440
Stop saying that to his girlfriends.

310
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,880
I don't know what you got
between you and him,

311
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:06,040
but I believe that my brother is a nice guy.

312
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:09,640
He told you that he helped you, too.

313
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:12,480
Helped?

314
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:14,520
With what?

315
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:34,280
A nice guy, my ass.

316
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:03,680
- Hey.
- Into the car.

317
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:06,040
- Right.
- See you soon.

318
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:07,490
- Take care of each other, okay?
- Yeah, yeah.

319
00:23:07,530 --> 00:23:08,610
Have a safe trip home.

320
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:26,480
What am I to you, exactly?

321
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:29,840
Hey!

322
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:31,480
Can you fucking hear me?!

323
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,050
I can.

324
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:37,200
What the hell is wrong with you?

325
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:39,720
I'm fine.

326
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:42,800
Then why did you ignore me?

327
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:47,200
You think you can just show up
and leave as you please?

328
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:49,000
Answer me, you brat!

329
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:53,790
God, the alcohol's getting to me.

330
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,120
Why were you with someone else?

331
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:04,480
You always give me rides to places,

332
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:08,280
so why do you make me have feelings for you?

333
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:12,380
That girl was Jan.

334
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:14,360
She's my friend.

335
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:22,840
I'm done caring!

336
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:27,200
What's wrong with you, Jan?

337
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:32,800
That's enough!

338
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:34,480
No more drinking.

339
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,200
- Hey...
- Huh?

340
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:46,460
I think

341
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:49,180
I don't deserve to be in a relationship.

342
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:54,080
Why?

343
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:59,360
I just want to have someone

344
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:02,760
who understands me.

345
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:08,290
But love always ruins everything.

346
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:17,400
Yeah.

347
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,720
I feel the same way as you do.

348
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,080
So tonight,

349
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:34,520
ride me home, okay?

350
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:35,960
Mm.

351
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:38,120
Sure.

352
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,280
Take it slow.

353
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:44,160
Easy.

354
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:51,720
Huh?

355
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,000
I found her wallet?

356
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:55,840
Mm.

357
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:00,160
God, why did I forget who she was?

358
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:05,600
Let me take you home, okay?

359
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,440
Then why did you ignore me?

360
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:12,640
You told me

361
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:15,240
that you didn't wanna see me.

362
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:17,600
Just answer the phone when I call you.

363
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:19,000
Alright?

364
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,080
You blocked my phone number?

365
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:22,440
Did you do it?

366
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:23,640
I know! I know!

367
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:26,120
I didn't do that.

368
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:32,400
Next time, I'll immediately answer the phone.

369
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:41,360
Now, let's go home.

370
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:15,960
Hey.

371
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:17,480
Watch your step.

372
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:08,400
What is it?

373
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:11,600
Can you stay?

374
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:16,880
I...

375
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:20,360
I have nobody else by my side.

376
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:40,360
This size is too small.

377
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:00,970
Ow!

378
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:58,000
Go to your room now.
I've gotta go.

379
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:04,190
Hey.

380
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:13,960
Stay at my place if you want.

381
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:21,560
Here.

382
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:23,680
Dry your hair,

383
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:25,360
or you'll catch a cold and die.

384
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:28,600
What?

385
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:30,560
You're worried about me?

386
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:32,360
Of course not.

387
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,880
What about you? Why didn't you dry your hair?

388
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:55,840
You might catch a cold and die, you know?

389
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:06,720
Ow!

390
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:10,280
That's what you get for pinching me.

391
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,000
Go away.

392
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:15,320
My bed is soaked.

393
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:22,320
Take it off, then.

394
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:24,320
Take off what, Kid?

395
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:28,240
Age is just a number.

396
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:30,280
But I'm...

397
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:32,160
fully grown now.

398
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:33,410
Get off.

399
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:37,320
Hey! What are you doing?

400
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:41,800
I'm just a boy who's curious.

401
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:59,720
Do you remember
the last time you were drunk?

402
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:03,650
You threw a whole box of condoms at me.

403
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:46,160
Nom! Please come to the gate quickly!

404
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:47,760
Phra Aek has been waiting for you.

405
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:48,900
Yes, Mom!

406
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:52,600
Whoa.

407
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:54,480
This new Little Guy looks stunning.

408
00:33:55,220 --> 00:33:56,280
Did you say "new"?

409
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:57,640
It's my friend's.

410
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:59,280
Mine's in the repair shop.

411
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:04,520
Thank you for picking me up,
Phra Aek, the kind.

412
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:09,080
Thanks for picking up
my sweetheart, Phra Aek.

413
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:11,760
Don't forget to wear helmets, okay?

414
00:34:11,909 --> 00:34:15,280
Don't go past the 60 km/h mark, understood?

415
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:16,760
Yes, understood!

416
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:17,960
Perfect.

417
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:21,800
- I've gotta go now, Mom.
- Okay.

418
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:37,239
Be careful now.

419
00:34:37,739 --> 00:34:39,040
Sit properly, okay?

420
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:40,639
Or else you'll fall over.

421
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:47,040
Whoa! Your new Little Guy
starts up fast, right?

422
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:49,679
Unlike your old one. It took forever.

423
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:52,679
- We're off now.
- Take care.

424
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:53,800
I'll be back, Mom!

425
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:55,520
- Hold on tight!
- Yes, Mom!

426
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:06,800
- Want some popcorn?
- Yeah!

427
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:09,320
I'll have two boxes of popcorn, please.

428
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:12,690
- Hold them for a minute.
- Sure.

429
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:17,840
Oh, hi, Pued.

430
00:35:18,130 --> 00:35:19,490
What kind of drinks would you like?

431
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:21,640
What should we get?

432
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:23,800
We'll have cups of red soda.

433
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:24,680
Red soda it is.

434
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,000
Thank you.

435
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:31,840
Here you go.

436
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:25,440
God, this is so good.

437
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:30,560
Hey, hey!

438
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:33,680
Where are you going again?

439
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:37,280
I'm dropping by somewhere around here.

440
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:39,440
Where are you going?

441
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,000
Be honest.

442
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:46,080
I'm delivering lunch to Phra Aek.

443
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:49,880
Have you had lunch yet?

444
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,400
Here! I already got some for myself.

445
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:56,200
Before you go,

446
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:57,960
I've got a question.

447
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:00,840
Are you and Phra Aek in a relationship?

448
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:06,280
I'm not sure.

449
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:07,970
What?

450
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:11,000
Then with you getting him stuff,

451
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:12,720
why are you doing it?

452
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:16,280
Well...

453
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:20,520
He wants us to learn
about each other together.

454
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:22,960
And you believed that?

455
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:24,160
Mm.

456
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:26,150
God, really?

457
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:29,280
Mm, stop asking me questions, okay?

458
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:31,840
I'm already flustered enough.

459
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:35,320
I've gotta go now.

460
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:36,760
Right, right.

461
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:40,720
What's with him?

462
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:44,560
Is he serious about this?

463
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:48,240
I think they've probably already hooked up.

464
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:49,200
Huh?!

465
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:52,600
They have?

466
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:53,760
You heard me.

467
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:57,560
God damn.

468
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:59,470
He's carrying those bags
like he's selling them.

469
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:01,080
My friend!

470
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:02,920
Hey, easy.

471
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:08,160
- At this rate, my career is in masonry.
- Is this okay?

472
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:08,960
Yeah.

473
00:39:11,850 --> 00:39:13,880
Hey, Nom!

474
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,130
Hi, Somchat.

475
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:16,520
Oh, Nom Jued.

476
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:19,160
Phra Aek, I got you lunch.

477
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:22,240
What's all the stuff?

478
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:24,760
This one's yours.

479
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:26,120
And this one's mine.

480
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:29,160
I also got some for your friends, too.

481
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:31,640
Would you like to have some, Somchat?

482
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:33,160
Whoa, really?!

483
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:35,720
- Thank you!
- You're not getting any of this!

484
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:38,200
Fuck you.

485
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:40,320
You're having five meal boxes?

486
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:41,560
You bet.

487
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:42,960
- Give me!
- Hey!

488
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:44,840
- Hey!
- There we go.

489
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:48,280
Nom Jued, I told you to only get two boxes.

490
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:50,600
We can share, you know?

491
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:52,400
Thank you!

492
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:53,680
How much are all of these?

493
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:56,880
It's fine. I'm not done compensating you.

494
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:03,560
Here. Take it.

495
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:06,760
Whoa!

496
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:08,640
You're giving me 1,000 baht a box?

497
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:10,600
Just take it.

498
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:13,680
Just have lunch already.

499
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:17,480
What photo are you submitting?

500
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:19,200
I'm not telling you.

501
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:21,120
Tell me.

502
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:22,600
Spill the beans.

503
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:24,160
Please.

504
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:25,960
No, it's a secret.

505
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:30,120
Also, come and see me
on the day of the exhibition.

506
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:33,160
Mm. Fine.

507
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:34,870
I don't wanna know anymore.

508
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:38,920
What? You're upset over me now?

509
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:41,040
Hey, are you?

510
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:44,040
Nope. I'm totally fine.

511
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:45,800
It's fine if you don't wanna tell me.

512
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:48,040
Come on.

513
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:49,440
You'll know it once you're there.

514
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:52,240
No. I'm done.

515
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:53,960
Hey! Don't be upset!

516
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:56,120
Just come to the exhibition
and you'll find out.

517
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:08,760
Noey!

518
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:11,680
Are you hurt?

519
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:13,600
I'm fine, Nom Jued.

520
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:19,080
Whoa...

521
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:23,040
I never knew you had
this many photos of Phra Aek

522
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:29,000
No matter how many pictures I've taken of him,

523
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:31,880
he still doesn't love me.

524
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:40,520
Do you still think
I'm worthy of your friendship?

525
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:43,920
Of course I do.

526
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:46,880
You're my friend, Noey.

527
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:51,000
Can you do me one more favor?

528
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:54,520
What is it?

529
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:58,320
If I can do it, I'll do it right away.

530
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:06,160
I wanna give it one more shot with Phra Aek.

531
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:10,240
Can you please stay away from the exhibition?

532
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:14,720
Why?

533
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:23,200
I wanna give myself another try.

534
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:54,200
Nom Jued.

535
00:42:57,480 --> 00:43:01,040
Thank you for giving me another chance.

536
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:04,040
Are you alright, Noey?

537
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:08,200
Take care of him, okay?

538
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:20,240
Hi, Nom Jued.

539
00:43:26,980 --> 00:43:29,400
Whoa, who's this?

540
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:31,520
Are you kidding me?

541
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:36,120
If it's Phra Aek, he shouldn't be
this handsome or bright.

542
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:38,680
He should be stinky, untidy,

543
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:41,320
and wear dirty clothes.

544
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:43,510
Come on, Nom.

545
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:48,920
Why do you look stunning
like a superstar today?

546
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:52,120
The look is just for you.

547
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:55,280
Let's check out the photo.

548
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:04,080
How is it? Isn't it gorgeous?

549
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:07,360
Mm. It's very beautiful.

550
00:44:07,770 --> 00:44:09,080
I love it.

551
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:11,800
I look so adorable in that photo.

552
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:17,440
You don't have to be nice to
everyone on Earth, though.

553
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,560
Being nice to me is enough.

554
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:23,480
That's so cheesy, Phra Aek.

555
00:44:24,360 --> 00:44:25,360
What?

556
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:29,000
Still, you're my one and only superhero.

557
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:35,200
Um...

558
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:39,600
A while ago, Noey...

559
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:40,960
Mm.

560
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,680
I've already spoken to him,

561
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:46,080
telling him that I've already found the one.

562
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:51,840
It's you, my one and only.

563
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:03,240
Feel free to swing by my place, you know.

564
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:05,320
I promise you
that I'll take care of you very well.

565
00:45:06,700 --> 00:45:08,320
Mm. Thank you.

566
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:13,840
I'm gonna throw up because of you guys.

567
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:16,120
You even changed up your looks to be cooler.

568
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:18,890
Maybe it's that
you wanna make Nom Jued fall for you.

569
00:45:21,080 --> 00:45:24,280
It's such a misfortune
that my homie ended up with you.

570
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:25,520
Ended up with who?

571
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:26,840
You, of course.

572
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:28,560
- Chat, you're such a...
- It's you.

573
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:30,160
- You want some of this?
- Wanna go?

574
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:31,280
- Easy, guys.
- Right here.

575
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:32,680
Calm down, you two.

576
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:35,640
No matter how you look on the outside,

577
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:38,520
your heart is the best there is,

578
00:45:39,560 --> 00:45:41,800
even if you're rude at times.

579
00:45:42,820 --> 00:45:45,600
Aww, come on.

580
00:45:53,560 --> 00:45:54,560
Why are you smiling?

581
00:45:57,460 --> 00:45:59,690
I'm happy. I'm gonna show this to my mom.

582
00:46:01,090 --> 00:46:02,360
Just hop in the cab already.

583
00:46:03,330 --> 00:46:04,090
Mm.

584
00:46:04,130 --> 00:46:05,850
- Thanks, Phra Aek.
- Mm.

585
00:46:06,230 --> 00:46:07,590
Text me when you're home.

586
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:11,860
See you later!

587
00:46:12,090 --> 00:46:13,090
- Bye-bye!
- Bye-bye.

588
00:46:23,190 --> 00:46:24,190
Oh, Korn.

589
00:46:25,630 --> 00:46:27,130
You're really gonna submit that photo?

590
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:30,730
Mm, I'm doing it for Nom Jued.

591
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:34,190
It's because I love him,
and I don't know if I'll have the chance again.

592
00:46:36,230 --> 00:46:37,790
I've gotta give it to you.

593
00:46:38,730 --> 00:46:41,060
You know that I'm stubborn.

594
00:46:41,560 --> 00:46:44,530
As for you, win the award, okay?

595
00:46:45,090 --> 00:46:46,990
Right, I know.

596
00:46:47,710 --> 00:46:49,690
You've gotta help me, okay?

597
00:46:49,860 --> 00:46:50,690
Sure thing.

598
00:47:56,680 --> 00:47:57,480
Whoa!

599
00:48:04,310 --> 00:48:06,080
He sent me a scary video again.

600
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:29,570
You actually know how to tidy up your room?

601
00:48:30,030 --> 00:48:32,730
Yeah, or else,
my fiancé is gonna slit my throat.

602
00:48:33,430 --> 00:48:34,970
Huh? Who's your fiancé?

603
00:48:35,500 --> 00:48:36,500
Who knows.

604
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:45,270
What?

605
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:51,530
Phra Aek, why did you pull me onto your lap?

606
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:54,200
Why? Is it a big deal sitting like this?

607
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:56,300
Well, why didn't you ask me?

608
00:48:57,930 --> 00:48:59,170
Whatever. Just sit here.

609
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:14,600
Alright, little Nom Jued.

610
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:16,160
What would you like to have?

611
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:18,960
Anything, Phra Aek.

612
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:20,800
Okay. Sure.

613
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:26,640
Don't mess about, please.

614
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:28,800
I'll prepare it for you, okay?

615
00:50:35,160 --> 00:50:36,830
Yeah, there!

616
00:50:37,330 --> 00:50:38,590
Come on! Pass the ball!

617
00:50:45,630 --> 00:50:46,670
How was that a miss?

618
00:50:50,030 --> 00:50:52,190
Oh? Why are you just standing there?

619
00:50:52,230 --> 00:50:53,230
Take a seat.

620
00:50:53,930 --> 00:50:55,060
No,

621
00:50:55,290 --> 00:50:56,790
you're gonna tease me again.

622
00:50:57,960 --> 00:50:58,960
Suit yourself.

623
00:51:00,190 --> 00:51:02,280
Yeah! There we go!

624
00:51:07,230 --> 00:51:08,230
What?

625
00:51:11,260 --> 00:51:13,060
Give me attention first, Phra Aek.

626
00:51:13,830 --> 00:51:15,490
Don't just watch the game.

627
00:51:24,030 --> 00:51:24,890
Ow.

628
00:51:30,730 --> 00:51:31,730
Phra Aek.

629
00:51:32,330 --> 00:51:33,860
Stop watching the game for a moment.

630
00:51:36,590 --> 00:51:38,130
Come on, give me a second.

631
00:51:42,930 --> 00:51:44,030
Not again.

632
00:51:54,530 --> 00:51:56,160
What are you doing?

633
00:51:56,890 --> 00:51:58,460
I'm making you pay attention to me.

634
00:52:00,030 --> 00:52:03,230
If you're doing that, it's gonna make me...

635
00:52:04,430 --> 00:52:05,560
Make you what?

636
00:52:06,230 --> 00:52:06,930
Oh?

637
00:52:07,990 --> 00:52:09,520
I think I'm sitting on a TV remote.

638
00:52:09,560 --> 00:52:10,430
Give me a moment.

639
00:52:15,860 --> 00:52:16,690
Did you

640
00:52:18,360 --> 00:52:19,790
study sex education?

641
00:52:21,260 --> 00:52:22,730
Yes, I did.

642
00:52:23,430 --> 00:52:24,960
I studied the Math-Science program,
you know?

643
00:52:26,590 --> 00:52:27,590
And...

644
00:52:29,830 --> 00:52:31,460
If the TV remote is sitting this upright...

645
00:52:32,630 --> 00:52:33,630
What do we do?

646
00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:34,240
What are you doing, Phra Aek?

647
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:55,110
Why are you putting a ring on me?

648
00:55:57,140 --> 00:55:58,370
Just keep it on.

649
00:55:59,270 --> 00:56:00,640
You're my partner now.

650
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:05,670
Come on, that's not very romantic of you.

651
00:56:05,870 --> 00:56:06,840
What?

652
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:07,810
Fine.

653
00:56:08,710 --> 00:56:10,050
I'll...

654
00:56:12,380 --> 00:56:15,830
I'll do something more romantic.

655
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:18,330
I'm tired.

656
00:56:18,370 --> 00:56:19,500
I'm gonna hit the sack now.

657
00:56:20,870 --> 00:56:21,770
What?

658
00:56:24,530 --> 00:56:25,700
Come on!

659
00:57:07,730 --> 00:57:08,600
Nom Jued?

660
00:57:09,770 --> 00:57:10,630
Nom Jued.

661
00:57:11,970 --> 00:57:12,900
Nom Jued!

662
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:29,000
Come on.

663
00:57:32,670 --> 00:57:33,870
Why isn't he answering the phone?

664
00:57:45,170 --> 00:57:46,030
What?

665
00:57:46,870 --> 00:57:47,700
Was...

666
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:50,430
Did I just get banged and ditched?

667
00:58:04,030 --> 00:58:06,130
This is Nom Jued.

668
00:58:06,570 --> 00:58:07,700
He's my lover.

669
00:58:09,400 --> 00:58:10,300
Your lover?

670
00:58:10,760 --> 00:58:11,840
Hey, Pai!

671
00:58:12,300 --> 00:58:13,700
You're here as well?!

672
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:14,880
Hey!

673
00:58:15,700 --> 00:58:18,630
Tell me where your brother took Nom Jued to.
