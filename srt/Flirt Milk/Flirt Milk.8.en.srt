the exact position

and momentum of a particle
with absolute precision.

51

The more precisely one quantity is measured,

52
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:57,079
the less precisely the other can be known.

53
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:01,680
Particles behave differently from objects
in the macroscopic realm,

to wear my hoodie?

and feeling cold,

162
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,760
as if I have a fever.

163
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:24,480
It's all in your head.

164
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,400
- Hey.
- Oh?

165
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,200
- Let's go to the convenience store.
- That's a no.

166
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:35,960
Come on!

167
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:38,520
- Please come with me.
- I'm not coming with you.

168
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:41,240
- You've been sitting here all day, Chat!
- I'm fine staying here!

169
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,360
Let's go to the convenience store!

170
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,640
Did you see someone just walk by?

171
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:47,720
Go!

172
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:49,400
Fine, I'll go.

173
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,920
- You always want me to get rough with you.
- Believe me...

174
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:56,000
See? I almost left my bag here.

175
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,240
Quickly!

176
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:01,840
What do you think I'm like?

177
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,280
You're nice, talented,

178

kind-hearted,
and caring toward your friends.

179
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:09,440
Are there bad things about me?

180
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,120
- Bad things?
- Yeah.

181
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,240
Sure.

182
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:15,560
You like to mess with others,
are overly possessive,

00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:23,850
Fuck...

187
00:11:23,890 --> 00:11:25,680
- That's everything.
- Everything?

188
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:26,800
Oh, one more thing.

189
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,480
- Huh?
- You're an asshole.

190
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,200
That's an extra one.

191
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,800
Yeah, what you said about me is true.

192
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,040
And...

193
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:41,040
What do I have to do
if I wanna hit on someone?

194
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,640
Just walk up to them
and do it.

195
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:45,320
Why overcomplicate things?

196
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:46,720
It's not that simple, though.

197
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:49,240
I should've taken that person to places,

198
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:50,920
to restaurants,

199
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,240
or gone on a date, too.

200
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:53,880
Trust me.

201
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:56,760
Simply treating them nicely
and being by their side

202
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,270
are more than enough.

203
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,600
Yeah, thanks.

204
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:02,640
Isn't that right?

205

[Buy a pack of drinking water
and receive a free, lovely-looking keychain]

206
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:11,940
Whoa.

207
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:13,480
What's this pack of water for?

208
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:15,280
You're donating it to a charity or what?

209
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:19,360
Well, if I bought it in a pack, I'd receive...

210
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:20,480
Receive what?

211
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:23,760
A free poster?

212
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,680
Yeah, a free poster.

213
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:26,520
Of course not!

214
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:27,880
Fucking hell...

215
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:30,400
That's not drinking water.

216
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:31,640
It's all over my face.

217
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:03,800
Hello?

218
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:05,480
Jued.

219
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,480
What's going on, Phra Aek?

220
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,000
Did you take your medicine?

221
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:11,140
I did.

222
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:14,080
Why aren't you sleeping, though?

223
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,600
How did you know?

224
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,880
You're here at my house?

225
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,320
I'm not.

226
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,240
I'm not at your house.

227
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:31,120
Then, who's that?

228
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:34,240
Your sickness is playing a trick on you.

229
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,000
Why would I be at your house?

230
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:40,280
Don't lie, okay?

231
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:41,880
It's obvious.

232
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:45,120
Just hit the hay already.

233
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,560
If you don't get better tomorrow,

234
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,200
I'm gonna smack you.

235
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:50,940
Mm.

236
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:52,800
Don't worry.

237
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:56,400
Mm.

238
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:58,240
Bye.

239
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:25,440
Oh, Nom.

240
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,600
Someone put this at the front of the gate.

241
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:28,920
I don't know whose it is.

242
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:30,720
It's for me, Mom.

243
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,840
Is it from Phrab or Pai?

244
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:38,480
Neither.

245
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,720
It's from Phra Aek.

246
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:03,920
Phra Aek.

247
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,560
Oh, what's up?

248
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:07,840
What is it?

249
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:11,400
Have you seen my work
that I asked you to comment on?

250
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:12,720
No,

251
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:14,120
but I already showed it to Somchat.

252
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,360
Oh, really?

253
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,090
Well...

254
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,560
Can you look at this?

255
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:24,640
Maybe this will jog your memory.

256
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:38,440
[Phra Aek Rattanachaikul]

257
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,740
Your photo is stunning.

258
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:51,440
Only around four people liked my work.

259
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:56,800
Now, with me included, make it five.

260
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:02,440
Why don't you submit this photo
to a photo contest?

261
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,400
It's such an emotional piece.

262
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:08,320
This is the style I'm actually doing, too.

263
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:09,440
Oh.

264
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:15,680
Take a look.

265
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:17,470
Whoa.

266
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,920
This is decent, actually.

267
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,160
It is, right?

268
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:32,360
Mm.

269
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,800
I've gotta go.

270
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:45,640
With this photo?

271
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:50,000
I didn't think I'd submit
this photo for the contest

272
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:52,920
because I thought I wouldn't win.

273
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:55,340
However...

274
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:59,440
A student at the open house
saw something in this image

275
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:02,000
and suggested I go for it.

276
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,839
So I'd like to thank him for that,

277
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:07,119
and if he's watching this...

278
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,599
Next year, if you join the faculty,

279
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,400
let's take photos together.

280
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:15,920
Noey!

281
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:17,319
Yeah.

282
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:22,040
That person who you invited to
take photos with was...

283
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:25,079
How come you're telling me just now?

284
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:27,800
I wasn't sure how to approach you.

285
00:17:28,339 --> 00:17:29,720
You always seem so busy.

286
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,640
Yeah, you're right.

287
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,760
I don't know what I should comment on.

288
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:39,720
I think it's me who needs
your feedback more than anything.

289
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,160
I think...

290
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,560
You just have to find your own style.

291
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:49,280
After that, you'll have an easier time
with photography.

292
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:54,000
How did you find your own style?

293
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:56,680
I just keep doing things randomly.

294
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,400
Find your passion.

295
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:02,280
"Find your passion"?

296
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:03,400
Yeah.

297
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:06,160
When I'm passionate about something,

298
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,920
I'll go out and find it.

299
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,440
I'll try, test,

300
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:11,560
and keep doing it.

301
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,030
Sure.

302
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:14,400
I'll give it a shot.

303
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:17,800
By the way,
why don't you try shooting portraits?

304
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:20,040
The only subject I'm interested in is you.

305
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:25,120
Do you know that

306
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:31,600
you're the person who made me
wanna study at this faculty?

307
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:33,880
I wanna take photos with you.

308
00:18:34,730 --> 00:18:36,610
When will you invite me?

309
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:39,120
Mm...

310
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:43,320
Just tell me when you wanna do it.

311
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:45,420
I'll manage my schedule around it.

312
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:47,280
Sure thing!

313
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:48,600
We'll go on a photography trip together.

314
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:49,420
Mm.

315
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,160
Honestly,

316
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,000
after submitting the photo to the contest,

317
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:02,720
I've received numerous comments.

318
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:05,760
They were both negative and positive ones.

319
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:10,240
I realize that we can't please everyone.

320
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:13,720
You've been busy with work

321
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:15,300
nonstop.

322
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:16,320
Mm.

323
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,200
I'm simply making a living.

324
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:20,800
You're so awesome.

325
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:23,720
I wanna be like you.

326
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:25,680
Mm...

327
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:27,760
Are you free this Saturday?

328
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:29,240
I am.

329
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:32,080
You're inviting me to a photography trip?

330
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,000
Mm.

331
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:34,560
Let's go on a trip.

332
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,280
Sure.

333
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:39,920
I've got a shooting location in mind, too.

334
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,560
Let's go there together.

335
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:42,480
Sure thing.

336
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:54,240
[Kornthep: Nom Jued, are you better now?]

337
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:59,560
[Nom Jued: I am]

00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:02,400
[Kornthep: You would like to
have a meal together?]

339
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:08,200
Oh, Nom Jued!

340
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,320
Fancy meeting you here!

341
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:11,360
- Hi, Somchat.
- Hello.

342
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,720
I'm here to get some milk.

343
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:13,600
Oh...

344
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:16,040
What about you?
What are you doing here?

345
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:17,120
I'm getting these.

346
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,680
They're for Phra Aek.

347
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,760
You can't feed him dog food!

348
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:26,480
We'll see about that.

349
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:27,950
Okay?

350
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:35,050
By the way, do you know

351
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,040
if he likes watching movies or not?

352
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,440
He absolutely does!

353
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:42,000
Do you know that he's been working on a film?

354
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:45,080
I think it's almost done now.

355
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:46,600
Yeah.

356
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:50,880
He's into both photography
and cinematography?

357
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:51,920
Exactly.

358
00:20:52,170 --> 00:20:56,480
But I prefer taking photos of celebrities,
like paparazzi.

359
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,400
Whoa.

360
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,840
- That's nice, Somchat.
- Of course.

361
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:03,880
I think I should ask him to see a movie.

362
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,040
What movie?

363
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,960
Spill the beans for me.

364
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:13,560
What movie?

365
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:15,120
It's...

366
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:18,240
It's the one that your faculty has done.

367
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:21,320
I've never heard of it!

368
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:23,720
I think someone lied to you.

369
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:25,040
It's a thing.

370
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:27,000
See?

371
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:33,100
"Cinemaddict Film Festival"?

372
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:41,440
Yum, yum.

373
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,120
Where's the doggo?

374
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:57,760
There!

375
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:09,640
Let's see if Phra Aek eats dog food

376
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:10,960
or not!

377
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,000
Phra Aek!

378
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:16,080
- This way!
- Aww, a doggo!

379
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:17,080
Good!

380
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,480
Hold on!

381
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:20,600
This way!

382
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:21,920
Halt!

383
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,790
- Whoa!
- How about that?

384
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:26,960
She understands English, too.

385
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29,160
Give it a go.

386
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:32,200
She already gave her paw
without saying the word!

387
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:37,280
She's the beloved dog of this faculty.

388
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:38,760
Isn't she cute?

389
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,360
Aww...

390
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:43,520
I thought you were actually gonna give
the dog food to Phra Aek.

391
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:54,780
Hey, Jued.

392
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:58,800
Hi, Phra Aek.

393
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:02,080
Somchat wants me to play with Phra Aek.

394
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,800
What are you doing here, stupid dog?!

395
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:05,960
Go away!

396
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:07,280
What?

397
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:10,040
Phra Aek! Why did you shoo her away?

398
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:12,160
Don't call it Phra Aek.

399
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,040
Huh?

400
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:16,040
That's my name!

401
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:18,560
Don't get mad.

402
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:21,840
I'm not mad.

403
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,160
Then, don't make an angry face.

404
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:26,640
Smile!

405
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:31,480
Oh, by the way...

406
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:33,200
Do you enjoy watching movies?

407
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,280
Why is that important to you?

408
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:38,480
Let's watch the movie
from your faculty this Saturday.

409
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:41,280
What's the name of the movie?

410
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:44,720
It's 'Rabbit' or something.

411
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:47,800
Why did you invite me?

412
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,720
You've helped me several times,

413
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:52,160
you even left snacks for me at the gate.

414
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,920
Also, you always offer me a ride.

415
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:55,960
Who left you snacks
at the gate of your house?

416
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:58,760
Be honest, okay?

417
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:02,920
The ticket's on you, then.

418
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,120
Sure. That's fine.

419
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:08,280
What?

420
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:16,240
- Nom Jued!
- Hi, Noey!

421
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:18,320
Are you guys watching a movie?

422
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:20,000
Yes.

423
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:21,080
Wanna tag along?

424
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:22,440
Sure! Let's go!

425
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:24,440
When's the movie?

426
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,840
It's this Saturday, right? Phra Aek?

427
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:27,640
Mm.

428
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:32,120
But you already have
an appointment with me, Phra Aek.

429
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:34,360
Yeah!

430
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:36,840
You're right!

431
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:40,520
Oh, really?

432
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:42,560
Maybe next time, then.

433
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:47,840
Well...

434
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:50,400
How about watching the movie
with Kornthep instead?

435
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:52,240
He might be available.

436
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:53,160
Yeah!

437
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,360
Hey, Jued!

438
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:02,880
Korn, are you free this Saturday?

439
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:04,240
Of course.

440
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:05,640
- You are, right?
- Mm.

441
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:08,600
Look at them, Phra Aek.

442
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,120
They're perfect for each other, no?

443
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:11,400
How exactly?

444
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:16,320
Someone told me that
they've been talking to each other.

445
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:17,560
Huh?

446
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,280
But I don't really know

447
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:25,440
what Nom Jued thinks about Korn.

448
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:31,400
But I think Korn has feelings for him.

449
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,120
Who are you talking to?

450
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:00,560
My friend.

451
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:14,480
[N: Are you gonna do something naughty to me?]

452
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
What are you doing?

453
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:24,160
Who is this?

454
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:26,800
Why did you look through my phone?

455
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:29,600
Tell me the truth.

456
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,760
Are you cheating on me?

457
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:33,720
So what?

458
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:36,600
We're a couple, aren't we?

459
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,440
Just tell me next time

460
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:39,480
so that we are not one.

461
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:01,960
Oh?

462
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:03,480
Something on your mind?

463
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:05,440
Who are you talking to?

464
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:08,320
Why?

465
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:10,260
Are you paranoid?

466
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:12,240
Nope.

467
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,080
It's actually about the project.

468
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:23,080
I'm sorry for doubting you.

469
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:25,240
It's fine.

470
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:26,960
I'll...

471
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:29,400
I'll make you trust in me, okay?

472
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:33,160
Thanks.

473
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:45,520
See? It's about the project.

474
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:46,320
I know.

475
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:47,800
Okay.

476
00:27:57,620 --> 00:27:58,520
Come on.

477
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,040
You're showing up late these days.

478
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:21,440
I'm sorry.

479
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:23,560
I got caught up in a project.

480
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:26,520
I've even rushed my way here.

481
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:28,600
Whatever. I'm kidding.

482
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:31,800
You don't have to please me that much, actually.

483
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:34,240
By the way, are you hungry?

484
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:36,160
Wanna have something?

485
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:38,120
Mm...

486
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,200
I have no idea.

487
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,240
How about...

488
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,080
having dinner at a place by my college?

489
00:28:44,930 --> 00:28:46,040
You sure it's a good idea?

490
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:48,280
It's a long ride from here.

491
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:49,520
Also...

492
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:51,920
It's gonna be tiring for you.

493
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:53,240
It's fine.

494
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:55,440
I actually have to go there
to submit a project.

495
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:57,320
I'll drop by my college first.

496
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,280
Let's get going, then.

497
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,280
Look out!

498
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:07,560
Keep your eyes on the fucking road!

499
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:10,440
- Fucking... Go and get him back here.
- Are you alright?

500
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:13,760
I'm a law student,

501
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:15,200
not a military student.

502
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:17,040
They're the same thing.

503
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:19,790
And you...

504
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:21,480
Why are you still being upset?

505
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:24,020
It's upsetting, isn't it?

506
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:25,880
I'm on a footpath, not on a road.

507
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:28,080
That's not fair.

508
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:31,920
Stuff like this needs to be fixed
on a structural level.

509
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:47,360
Why!

510
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:50,200
What are you doing?
You're gonna make a mess.

511
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:52,040
I'm really sorry.

512
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:02,560
Am I late?

513
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:04,800
Just dig in already.

514
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:06,480
The dish is getting cold.

515
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:22,520
Why did you choose to study law?

516
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:25,400
I don't know.

517
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:27,680
Maybe it's that I was born in the country.

518
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:31,240
So was I.

519
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:32,480
Mm...

520
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:35,600
Growing up, I've seen
countless people get scammed

521
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:38,040
by even the smallest of things.

522
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:42,360
Maybe it's that...

523
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:47,080
They see the locals there inferior
and less knowledgeable.

524
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:53,920
Mom.

525
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:56,200
The contract you just signed

526
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:00,160
is offering a plot of land
to the broker basically for free.

527
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:02,790
Huh?

528
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:05,920
Also...

529
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:08,460
This line here.

530
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:12,680
Many hidden fees are buried in this line of texts.

531
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:15,880
What? Good heavens!

532
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:19,280
When we talked about the agreement,

533
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:21,360
they said they'd offer us a high payout.

534
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:23,400
Honey, you didn't help me with this.

535
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:25,800
What am I supposed to do
having the contract already signed?

536
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:29,030
Who would know they'd have these things hidden?

537
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:30,840
It's got only a few terms and conditions.

538
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:36,840
Aside from losing a plot of land,

539
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:39,400
we also have to pay them money.

540
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:40,760
Disastrous!

541
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:43,760
Gosh...

542
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:50,400
It's okay.

543
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:51,920
Whatever is lost is lost.

544
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:54,440
We can buy a new one later.

545
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:00,000
Aren't there ways

546
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:02,640
we can cancel the contract?

547
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:06,160
As far as I've read,

548
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:08,640
there aren't any, Mom.

549
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:32,240
And...

550
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,240
Did you have more faith?

551
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:41,510
I do have faith in the power of the law,

552
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:46,680
but I have no faith in those with the power.

553
00:32:51,060 --> 00:32:52,800
Maybe that's why I became a law student.

554
00:32:53,780 --> 00:32:55,720
I wanna be an enforcer of the law

555
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,640
who others, and I myself included, can believe in.

556
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:08,240
I do believe you'll be a law enforcement
officer that everyone can count on.

557
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:12,880
Thank you.

558
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:20,180
As I've said, however,

559
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,280
my family is very laid back.

560
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:26,760
They're so laid back that
they've forgotten about many things.

561
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:29,840
Taxes, for example,

562
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:31,600
are what I'm taking care of for them.

563
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:36,480
It's a climb having them do it themselves.

564
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:38,160
Yeah.

565
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:43,040
So is my family.

566
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,040
My parents don't listen to me.

567
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,120
It's one step at a time.

568
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:53,480
- Right?
- Yeah.

569
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:06,440
You almost look cool there.

570
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:33,000
Fuck!

571
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:35,000
- This place has tables available.
- An à la carte place?

572
00:34:35,159 --> 00:34:35,960
Yeah.

573
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:38,000
Oh, what's going on, Rong?

574
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:39,639
Is this the place you suggested?

575
00:34:40,679 --> 00:34:42,280
Yeah, it's my first time here.

576
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:44,000
Do you have any suggested dishes?

577
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:46,239
Wait,

578
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:48,520
you ordered two dishes?

579
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:52,560
Despite that, you still look so fine.

580
00:34:53,719 --> 00:34:54,480
Yes.

581
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:57,160
It looks nice, though.

582
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:02,080
By the way, place your orders at the front.

583
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:03,880
The chef ears are quite bad,

584
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:05,520
- There?
- so you have to be quite close to her.

585
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,560
What does this mean?

586
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:20,960
Hey!

587
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:22,600
Pai.

588
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:24,920
Did you just randomly appear here?

589
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:26,200
How did you get here?

590
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:27,320
You came here with Rong?

591
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:29,350
I...

592
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:30,680
I swung by to shop for some stuff.

593
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:33,400
I've gotta go.

594
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:34,480
- Huh?
- Hey!

595
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:35,560
I can give you a ride, you know?

596
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:36,920
What's with him?

597
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:53,200
Hey.

598
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:56,640
What's wrong with you?

599
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:00,320
Why didn't you tell me that
they were coming here too?

600
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:03,000
Is it really that bad being with me?

601
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:05,160
Yeah.

602
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:09,120
You didn't consider what they'd think of me
seeing us being together?

603
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:10,320
You're such a...

604
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:24,400
I'm sorry.

605
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:29,120
That's enough.

606
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:32,000
From now on, don't come and pick me up

607
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:33,280
and mess with me!

608
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,680
The semester is finally over!

609
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:50,080
By the way, Phra Aek...

610
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:53,080
What do you have to stand against Korn?

611
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:55,400
It's a secret.

612
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:58,120
Just know that I'm doing my best.

613
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:01,480
What does that even mean?

614
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:03,800
Anyway,

615
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:08,960
your skills are certified at the national level.

616
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,440
This battle is nothing.

617
00:37:10,860 --> 00:37:12,080
You can easily beat him.

618
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:14,840
Yeah, it's a cakewalk for me.

619
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:17,160
You're getting ahead of yourself.

620
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,720
- Hey! Look!
- Hm?

621
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:24,320
They're looking for a guitarist.

622
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:26,040
Can you go and do it?

623
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:27,560
What guitarist?

624
00:37:27,990 --> 00:37:30,880
It's for the film festival.

625
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:31,920
It's being held on this Saturday!

626
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:34,920
God, I've gotta go out with Noey this Saturday.

627
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:36,720
Listen.

628
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:39,440
You've already given up on Nom Jued?

629
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,760
You're letting Kornthep claim him?

630
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:44,840
Seriously? Kornthep?

631
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:46,480
He's a busy bee.

632
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:47,880
He won't even get a chance!

633
00:37:48,580 --> 00:37:49,580
A chance for what?

634
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:50,600
Whoa!

635
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:52,960
Nom Jued! What brings you here?

636
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:55,760
I'm here to get some milk.

637
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:57,640
Would you guys like to have some?

638
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:59,000
- This one's for you.
- Mine!

639
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:00,920
I'll have it.

640
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,200
Don't give it to Chat.

641
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:13,120
As for the rest, save it for yourself.

642
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:14,880
Drink lots of milk so you'll grow tall.

643
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:18,280
Wait! My class is starting!

644
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:19,720
See you guys later.

645
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:23,000
Bye.

646
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:29,120
Ahem!

647
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:31,000
So what it's gonna be?

648
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:33,280
You're calling the gig a pass or not?

649
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:41,880
[Faculty of Fine and Applied Arts]

650
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:44,480
Hey.

651
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:46,000
Phra Aek.

652
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:47,410
Hey.

653
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:52,560
Shine for them.

654
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:45,800
Actually,

655
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:48,440
I'd like to confess something to you.

656
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:50,760
Hm?

657
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:54,680
I...

658
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:57,840
I just want you to give me some attention,

659
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:01,200
just like what you do with Nom Jued.

660
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:06,200
Can you elaborate?

661
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:11,960
Sometimes, I get jealous of Nom Jued.

662
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:15,640
No matter how talentless he is,

663
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:18,360
everyone still loves him.

664
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,640
You should go now.

665
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:27,480
Soon...

666
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:31,840
Kornthep is gonna ask Nom Jued
to be his boyfriend.

667
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:34,280
What did you just say?

668
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:37,520
You heard me.

669
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:43,200
Give up on Nom Jued

670
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:47,320
and open your heart to someone
who really loves you.

671
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:03,920
Huh?

672
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:04,930
What?

673
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:10,280
You?

674
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:20,760
Whoa!

675
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:23,560
What's going on?

676
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:34,560
What is this, Korn?

677
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:37,420
Nom Jued.

678
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,000
Please be my boyfriend.

679
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:43,160
- What?!
- Whoa!

680
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:46,440
Aww!

681
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:07,800
Korn, I...

682
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:09,560
Can I tell you something?

683
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:12,400
Absolutely.

684
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:13,640
What is it?

685
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:17,560
I think it's too soon.

686
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:18,880
And...

687
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:28,280
That's fine.

688
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:31,120
I just want to make it clear.

689
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:32,760
I...

690
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:34,640
I've given my all.

691
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:38,360
I think it's actually too soon.

692
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:40,080
You're also making me uncomfortable.

693
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:23,560
Have I made the right decision,

694
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:26,720
rejecting Kornthep, Phrab and Pai?

695
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:30,240
I simply don't understand you, Nom.

696
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:31,600
Why?

697
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:34,160
Yeah.

698
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:36,360
I actually don't understand myself, either.

699
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:41,280
I'm confused, too.

700
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:42,760
Why, though?

701
00:43:43,540 --> 00:43:44,760
He's not your type or something?

702
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:48,080
I think he's both handsome and nice.

703
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:56,760
What Korn did on that day made me uncomfortable,

704
00:43:57,320 --> 00:43:59,200
not to mention all the eyes staring at me.

705
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,600
It all felt too premature,

706
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:05,640
as if he was forcing me to say yes to him.

707
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:08,520
I've tried viewing it
from different perspectives,

708
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:12,120
but at the end of the day,
I'm not okay with him.

709
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:16,640
Right.

710
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:18,400
I think I get you now.

711
00:44:24,420 --> 00:44:25,420
But look.

712
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:28,680
There are these weird comments everywhere.

713
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:34,120
I can't do much, I'm afraid.

714
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:36,680
That's fine.

715
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:38,480
I'll take care of them myself.

716
00:44:40,140 --> 00:44:42,120
It's fine. Let them do it.

717
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:46,240
People prematurely judge others anyway.

718
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:53,280
It's okay, buddy.

719
00:44:53,990 --> 00:44:57,200
No matter what happens,
we're always right by your side.

720
00:44:57,240 --> 00:44:58,080
Yeah.

721
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:02,680
You did the right thing, listening to your heart.

722
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:05,560
Thank you so much,

723
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:07,880
Phrab and Pai.

724
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:09,440
Don't mention it.

725
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:14,640
I'm gonna smash those haters.

726
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:16,760
- How's that sound?
- I'll do it, too.

727
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:32,440
What's the location, Somchat?

728
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:39,440
Really?

729
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:41,400
What?

730
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:45,920
Are you good?

731
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:01,480
Phra Aek!

732
00:46:02,120 --> 00:46:03,480
You're late.

733
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:05,760
I'm not. I'm only ten minutes late.

734
00:46:09,120 --> 00:46:10,840
Let's get inside.

735
00:46:13,160 --> 00:46:14,160
Mm...

736
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:18,240
Did you drown in a barrel of beer
or something?

737
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:20,400
You're asking for trouble.

738
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:22,400
Why do you have to be so harsh?

739
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:23,680
Let's go.

740
00:46:34,520 --> 00:46:35,400
Excuse me.

741
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:42,000
What are you scared of?

742
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:46,360
I'm not, but...

743
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:47,920
I'm just too shy.

744
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:52,160
Nobody's judging you for rejecting Korn.

745
00:46:53,080 --> 00:46:54,670
- Really?
- Yeah.

746
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:56,280
Let's go.

747
00:46:58,520 --> 00:46:59,280
Hey.

748
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:03,080
Hey! It's...

749
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:06,760
Is that my homie or...

750
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:08,200
Who are you again? Are you Nom Jued?

751
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:10,920
Come and sit with me.

752
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:12,440
- Somchat.
- Yes?

753
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:16,040
I'm Nom Jued, not your homie.

754
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:18,200
Come on! Don't be serious about that.

755
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:19,560
We're close, no?

756
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:22,920
You've earned a title as a homie
or someone to that degree

757
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:24,960
to me.

758
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:28,400
God, you almost broke my glasses.

759
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:30,280
"To me", my ass. Move.

760
00:47:30,740 --> 00:47:31,600
To where?

761
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:32,720
Move.

762
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:33,960
Or you want more of that?

763
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:38,600
- If it weren't for Nom Jued...
- Yeah, move your butt.

764
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:40,200
Come here. Can you sit?

765
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:47,160
- God, just move already.
- It's already too tight!

766
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:49,120
Somchat, is it comfortable?

767
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:51,800
It is, I guess.

768
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:56,320
Phra Aek, are you comfortable?

769
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:07,040
Hey...

770
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,120
Are those two a couple?

771
00:48:13,840 --> 00:48:15,680
- What the fuck are you looking at?
- What?

772
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:18,160
- It's nothing!
- Let's drink up!

773
00:48:18,200 --> 00:48:20,400
Woo!

774
00:48:26,360 --> 00:48:28,520
Do you drink?

775
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:33,400
I'm sorry, but I don't.

776
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:35,120
Well...

777
00:48:35,720 --> 00:48:36,720
How about a glass of cola?

778
00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:41,120
I've already had too much of that.

779
00:48:42,540 --> 00:48:44,030
I'm worried about my stomach.

780
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:46,880
How about a cup of warm milk?

781
00:48:48,040 --> 00:48:49,880
It's okay. I'll have a glass of water.

782
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:53,360
Excuse me, could I get a cup of warm milk?

783
00:48:53,720 --> 00:48:54,400
Hm?

784
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:56,640
Are you fucking crazy?

785
00:48:56,680 --> 00:48:59,040
You're ordering a cup of warm milk at a pub?

786
00:48:59,080 --> 00:49:00,080
Where have you ever had that before?

787
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:01,800
Hm? You sure you're my guy?

788
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:03,720
I have, though.

789
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:10,360
A cup of warm milk, please.

790
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:12,800
God, you're stubborn.

791
00:49:12,840 --> 00:49:13,720
It's not available here.

792
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:15,960
They'd have already prepared it if it was.

793
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:18,560
Then you go and get some.

794
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:22,520
Tell either Ohm and Krit, the duo.

795
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:23,760
Go and bother them.

796
00:49:24,080 --> 00:49:24,960
Nope.

797
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:27,040
I'm asking you to get some.

798
00:49:28,700 --> 00:49:32,960
I'm doing it for Nom Jued sake, my homie.

799
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:34,510
Whatever! Just hurry up already.

800
00:49:34,550 --> 00:49:35,480
I'll be right back!

801
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:36,560
Huh?

802
00:49:36,920 --> 00:49:37,760
Sorry.

803
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:54,360
Let me see my friend real quick.
I'll be right back.

804
00:49:59,840 --> 00:50:00,920
What's up?

805
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:01,960
What's up, sis.

806
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,160
- It's been so long.
- Yeah.

807
00:50:05,240 --> 00:50:07,280
I've been very busy.

808
00:50:07,320 --> 00:50:08,560
- Really?
- Mm.

809
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:10,840
I've heard that you studied abroad.

810
00:50:19,900 --> 00:50:20,760
Here you go.

811
00:50:21,840 --> 00:50:24,680
It's the milk you requested.

812
00:50:25,220 --> 00:50:26,760
However, it's not warm.

813
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:29,440
It's just a carton of pasteurized milk.

814
00:50:29,480 --> 00:50:31,640
My dear homie, please enjoy.

815
00:50:35,560 --> 00:50:36,560
Where's my payout?

816
00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:42,480
Phra Aek, don't mess with him.

817
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:47,200
Somchat just wanted to take a walk.

818
00:50:47,320 --> 00:50:48,720
God damn, now this is obvious...

819
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:49,800
I'm the one paying.

820
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:52,640
Thanks, Somchat.

821
00:50:52,680 --> 00:50:53,560
It's okay.

822
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:55,640
Please enjoy.

823
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:58,520
- I can drink it?
- Yeah, go ahead.

824
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:13,320
- Cheers, with drink.
- Yeah, cheers.

825
00:51:14,680 --> 00:51:16,110
That's awesome.

826
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:22,440
Phra Aek, are you drunk?

827
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:24,160
No.

828
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:27,720
Take it lightly, okay?

829
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:30,120
Or else you're gonna blackout.

830
00:51:30,760 --> 00:51:31,560
Come on...

831
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:33,920
I'm not a lightweight.

832
00:51:34,540 --> 00:51:35,540
You're right.

833
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:37,480
It's because you're the green superhero.

834
00:51:39,840 --> 00:51:41,160
What green superhero?

835
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:42,960
Ow, that hurts.

836
00:51:44,840 --> 00:51:45,840
Drink up.

837
00:52:06,920 --> 00:52:08,560
Where are you going, Yingyam?

838
00:52:12,300 --> 00:52:13,760
God, what's up with your friend, sis?

839
00:52:14,930 --> 00:52:15,770
I don't know.

840
00:52:16,910 --> 00:52:19,110
She can't tell that I'm not a guy?

841
00:52:20,120 --> 00:52:22,680
I told you that I'd give you a ride home.

842
00:52:24,320 --> 00:52:25,600
Thanks, Shrek.

843
00:52:27,120 --> 00:52:27,760
Hey.

844
00:52:28,460 --> 00:52:29,720
Did you know that

845
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:32,360
Shrek isn't a superhero?

846
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:33,640
He's an ogre.

847
00:52:34,520 --> 00:52:37,880
But he's an ogre who's also a superhero.

848
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:40,840
He is just an ogre.

849
00:52:41,120 --> 00:52:42,120
Why?

850
00:52:42,640 --> 00:52:44,560
You don't wanna be my Shrek?

851
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:47,400
Well...

852
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:50,200
No.

853
00:52:57,160 --> 00:53:01,560
Batman or Superman might be
ideal superheroes to some,

854
00:53:01,840 --> 00:53:05,640
but to me, you'll always be Shrek, my superhero.

855
00:53:24,680 --> 00:53:26,600
Why are you staring at me like that, Phra Aek?

856
00:53:27,880 --> 00:53:28,760
I...

857
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:31,160
I'm feeling kinda thirsty.

858
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:33,920
Huh? Thirsty?

859
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:41,040
Thirsty.

860
00:53:41,640 --> 00:53:42,920
What do you mean, Phra Aek?

861
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:56,280
[Satrupai: Hey, are you there?]

862
00:55:07,080 --> 00:55:07,840
Excuse me.

863
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:10,840
Give me a hard-hitting shot.

864
00:55:11,080 --> 00:55:12,000
How old are you?

865
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:13,240
Can I see your ID card?

866
00:55:14,320 --> 00:55:15,320
Come on...

867
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:17,200
I lost it.

868
00:55:17,640 --> 00:55:18,560
Just get me a shot already.

869
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:26,440
Noey.

870
00:55:41,240 --> 00:55:42,160
Hey.

871
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:48,240
I like you.

872
00:56:51,060 --> 00:56:53,400
Why are you avoiding me
when I finally stopped running?

873
00:56:54,520 --> 00:56:56,160
Hey! What are you doing?

874
00:56:56,200 --> 00:56:59,360
I'm just a boy who's curious.
