No, I don’t wanna owe you anything,

113
00:07:56,630 --> 00:07:57,640

Yeah.

136
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:41,430
I'll send it to you in a second.

137
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:47,840
It's done.

138
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,040

Are you sure?

153
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,080
Change up your pose.

154
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:42,880
One more.

155
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,610
There. See?

156
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,810
If you want some shadow cast on your subject,

157
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:56,070
simply adjust the light and attach a softbox.

158
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,440
It softens the lighting.

159
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,480
Can you notice it?

160
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,450
Mm.

161
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:08,350
Korn, what's that camera for?

162
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:10,900
Oh.

163
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:13,510
That's for promoting
the club's social media pages.

164
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:17,570
I think it's not a good idea.

165
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:21,260
I don't want people to take me the wrong way.

166
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,430
Mm, sure.

167
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:26,360
If it makes you uncomfortable,
it's totally fine.

168
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:29,540
Oh.

169
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,530
- You haven't picked your assignment, right?
- Mm.

170
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:40,270
Let's see what you'll get.

171
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,020
Oh?

172
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:52,390
You're here to borrow a camera, right?

173
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,400
Noey! Hello!

174
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:55,860
That's right, Korn.

175
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:00,140
You said you were gonna use
your own camera, no?

176
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:03,900
I was gonna shoot it like how I always do.

177
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:06,320
But after some consideration,

178
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,800
I wanna try a different camera.

179
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:13,410
Freshmen already have
a lot of work on their hands, though.

180
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:15,200
Would you like to take it slow

181
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,650
so that you can find your own style?

182
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:18,390
Sure thing, Korn.

183
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:22,520
That means you knew photography
since you were in high school?

184
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,440
Yeah.

185
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:27,100
And what's your assignment?

186
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:29,270
Can I tag along?

187
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:33,320
I still don't know
what I'll shoot for my assignment.

188
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:35,310
Mm...

189
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:36,800
No problem.

190
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:39,380
What's your photo assignment, though?

191
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,480
It's "Environment."

192
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:50,880
Wait, yours is similar to mine.

193
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:52,310
I got "Nature."

194
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,360
Really?

195
00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:56,490
Would you like to go out on a shoot together?

196
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:57,720
That sounds awesome.

197
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:00,070
- Let's find a date for it.
- Mm!

198
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:14,380
- This is gorgeous.
- Yeah.

199
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:24,150
Beauty.

200
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:26,080
This one's pretty, isn't it?

201
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,070
- Mm.
- Right?

202
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:28,660
It's kinda pretty.

203
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,260
It's got great meaning behind it, too.

204
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,910
The message sounds hopeful.

205
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:35,480
Mm.

206
00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:40,360
Can you take a photo of me
with this painting?

207
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:41,640
Sure.

208
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,050
Thank you.

209
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:54,020
How is it?

210
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:56,520
Mm...

211
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,230
I don't look that great in this photo.

212
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:00,990
Can you retake it?

213
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,300
- Here.
- How is it?

214
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:11,840
I don't like it.

215
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:16,100
Can you make the frame a little bit tighter?

216
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:17,720
Make it look normal.

217
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:19,380
Mm.

218
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,240
Just make it look normal.

219
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:35,180
What about this?

220
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:39,940
Are you kidding me?

221
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:42,560
What?

222
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:43,960
How is this normal?

223
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:47,370
My head is out of frame.

224
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:51,210
It's the vibe.

225
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,200
But I want a normal photo.

226
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,930
- I'll try again, I guess.
- Stand closer to the wall.

227
00:14:59,040 --> 00:14:59,800
Mm.

228
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:00,840
I'll shoot it for you.

229
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,550
Turn your body a little bit this way.

230
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:06,520
- Like this?
- No, the other way.

231
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:07,760
- This way?
- Uh-huh.

232
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:08,680
Uh-huh.

233
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:10,090
- Is it good?
- That's perfect.

234
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:17,150
- Would you like to see the photos?
- Mm.

235
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,300
Whoa, this one's gorgeous.

236
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,380
Can I have the photo?

237
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,730
Mm, you can have it.

238
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:28,340
How can you send it to me, though?

239
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,260
It's fine. You can send it to me.

240
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:33,150
Then, I'll forward it to her.

241
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:35,350
Yeah, sure.

242
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:38,050
By the way...

243
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,750
Why are you here by yourself?

244
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:45,180
Well, the exhibition
I wanna check out is almost over.

245
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,650
So I have to be here before it's too late.

246
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:48,640
Then, that's great.

247
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,950
Let's ask her to tag along with us.

248
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:56,010
Maybe she wants to be alone, Jan.

249
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,890
Sure, I'm coming with you guys.

250
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:00,340
Awesome.

251
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:01,430
That's perfect.

252
00:16:01,450 --> 00:16:03,260
Please take photos of me, okay?

253
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:05,040
Take lots of pictures of me.

254
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,360
- Sure.
- Thank you.

255
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:09,630
- Let's check out that section.
- Mm.

256
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,320
Yingyam, can you take photos of us?

257
00:16:22,450 --> 00:16:23,710
I want candid shots.

258
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,070
I want them for a reel.

259
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:26,920
Okay.

260
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:31,760
What are you doing, Jan?

261
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:33,760
Taking photos of us.

262
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:35,520
Can we do it later?

263
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:36,870
I wanna enjoy the work first.

264
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,110
We haven't had any couple photos, though.

265
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:41,230
And you said I can do whatever I want today.

266
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:44,180
But we...

267
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,550
We're not a couple, Jan.

268
00:16:49,130 --> 00:16:50,580
We're still not?

269
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,510
When did I say that I'm yours?

270
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:01,410
Then why did you hit me up

271
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:03,640
if you didn't wanna date me?

272
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,079
Hey, stop shooting!

273
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:11,170
You're doing this again.

274
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,560
Jan, wait!

275
00:17:26,359 --> 00:17:27,280
Phra Aek.

276
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,750
Why are you making that face?

277
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,140
It's too hot.

278
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:34,120
We've arrived.

279
00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:36,200
I guess I've gotta go now.

280
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:37,740
Wait.

281
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:42,700
I have a class for half a day tomorrow.

282
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,760
That's the same for me, actually.

283
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:48,680
I think I'm gonna work on my photo assignment.

284
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:52,600
Lately, the Club Room looks kinda quiet,
doesn't it?

285
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:56,680
Everyone's busy with their midterm project.

286
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:59,800
Meet me in front of my faculty building
when you're done tomorrow.

287
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,190
Hm?

288
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,280
I'm not doing that.

289
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,240
That's all you'll get.

290
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,240
Phra Aek, wait!

291
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:33,550
Why do you wanna see me there?

292
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,400
What's up with him?

293
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:44,200
[Kornthep: Would you like to try a product shoot
on the day after tomorrow?]

294
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:08,160
[Satrupai: Have you seen my wallet?
I think I left it at the restaurant]

295
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:19,600
[Phra Rong: This one?]

296
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,960
[Satrupai: Yeah, did you find it?]

297
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,200
[Phra Rong: You dropped it

298
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:37,240
I was going to give it to you,
but you already left]

299
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,720
[Satrupai: Right, give it to
your fraternity brother]

300
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,200
[Satrupai: I'll get it from him]

301
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,840
[Phra Rong: I'm currently outside]

302
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:45,480
[Phra Rong: I'll come to your place
and give it to you]

303
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:50,040
[Satrupai: No, I'll get my wallet myself]

304
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,000
[Phra Rong: It's okay.
I'll go to your place]

305
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:54,000
[Satrupai: Hey, hold on]

306
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:58,160
[Phra Rong: That's it.
I have things to do now]

307
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:03,840
How did he know where I live?

308
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:20,450
What are you doing here?

309
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,500
I told you not to come.

310
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:26,270
Why didn't you tell me that
you didn't want your stuff back?

311
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:28,730
How did you know where I live?

312
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,760
Thanine told me your address.

313
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:34,150
Nine, you piece of...

314
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:35,960
Just hand it over already.

315
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:42,060
Hey.

316
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,360
You're not gonna say thank you?

317
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,030
Quit horsing around.

318
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:47,460
Hand it over.

319
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:49,960
I'm not horsing around.

320
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:51,850
But...

321
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:55,610
What does a man with good manners do?

322
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,460
I don't know. Give it!

323
00:20:58,600 --> 00:20:59,720
If you don't, then you can't have it.

324
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,110
We're all grown-ups here.

325
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,120
Thank you.

326
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:09,010
Huh?

327
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:10,730
Thank you.

328
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,520
It's that simple.

329
00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:13,600
Here.

330
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:16,350
Gosh.

331
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:18,550
It's your friend's.

332
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:20,390
She dropped it at the cafe.

333
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,240
Thank you.

334
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:26,200
By the way, how's the cafe doing?

335
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:28,410
It's just like what you saw.

336
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,110
It's gonna stay closed for a while.

337
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:33,760
But...

338
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:36,020
I've deleted the comments

339
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:37,910
and had my friends delete all of the videos.

340
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:39,600
It's whatever.

341
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,520
By the way, about the photo of your ID card...

342
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:44,680
I...

343
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:47,520
The photo of you with a buzz cut...

344
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:50,560
I didn't know that hairstyle

345
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:52,720
can make your forehead look so

346
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:55,280
brilliantly shiny.

347
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:58,750
What the hell?

348
00:21:58,920 --> 00:21:59,780
What?

349
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:01,990
You're stunned, aren't you?

350
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:06,270
What I'm trying to say is that

351
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:10,720
you looked pretty cute with a buzz cut.

352
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:16,750
Am I allowed to throw you into jail

353
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:17,960
for going through my ID card?

354
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:21,630
I had to look at it, didn't I?

355
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:23,900
I have to know who it belongs to.

356
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:25,650
Right.

357
00:22:30,930 --> 00:22:31,700
Oh...

358
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:34,790
Don't block my contact, okay?

359
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:37,100
Or else...

360
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:39,110
I'm gonna come all the way here to see you.

361
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:44,100
You're blocked.

362
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:16,240
Why are you here again?

363
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:19,250
I already told you

364
00:23:19,950 --> 00:23:21,160
not to block my contact.

365
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:22,720
Or else I'd come all the way here for you.

366
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:23,760
Go the hell away.

367
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:29,550
Let me guess.

368
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:31,990
You're thinking about

369
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:34,000
moving to a different place
to get away from me.

370
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:34,920
How nosy.

371
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:36,480
'Cause I wanna be nosy.

372
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:37,820
Be honest.

373
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,310
Why did you come here?

374
00:23:40,170 --> 00:23:41,430
I don't know.

375
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:44,080
If it weren't for you,
I'd have already called the police.

376
00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:45,510
I don't know.

377
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,050
I just wanna be here.

378
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:49,560
Please.

379
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:52,440
Can we just do our own thing?

380
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:55,680
No promise.

381
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,560
Go the hell back the way you came.

382
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:58,910
- Just get the hell out already.
- Ow!

383
00:23:59,050 --> 00:23:59,760
- Leave!
- Hey.

384
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,640
Hey, hey, hey.

385
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:04,840
Would you like to have shabu-shabu?

386
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:06,070
No.

387
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:07,600
Please.

388
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:08,450
I said no.

389
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:09,760
- Please have shabu-shabu with me.
- Hey!

390
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:11,210
- Please, please, please.
- I already said no.

391
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:12,640
- Hey!
- Let's have shabu-shabu.

392
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:13,840
Hey, brother!

393
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:15,940
- Hello, Mr. Security.
- Good day to you, sir!

394
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,300
Come on now.

395
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,210
Your boyfriend has already come this far.

396
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:21,200
Just say yes already.

397
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:22,320
He's not my boyfriend, sir.

398
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:23,520
Nuh-uh!

399
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:24,900
Don't be shy.

400
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:26,610
I've already seen ones like you.

401
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:29,190
You're so lucky to have
a boyfriend this handsome.

402
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:31,040
I already told you that he's not mine.

403
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:34,850
Look at him.

404
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:36,660
He looks so pitiful.

405
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:38,320
His eyes are all watery.

406
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:39,800
He's been waiting for you for hours.

407
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,120
Don't be so mean to your boyfriend, please.

408
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:44,240
Be gentle and take it slow.

409
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:45,640
That's how a love life thrives.

410
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:46,860
That's enough, sir.

411
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,580
It'll be too much if I tell you my story.

412
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:50,250
It's okay, sir.

413
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:52,720
I’ll keep waiting for him here.

414
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:53,920
Fine.

415
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:55,440
I'll go.

416
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:57,160
Amazing! That's how you do it!

417
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,470
May you two love each other forever!

418
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,240
Time to get back to work, brothers!

419
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:02,320
- Have a good day, sir!
- Bye-bye!

420
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:03,600
Have a safe journey.

421
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:04,230
Thank you!

422
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:05,950
Let's go.

423
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:12,210
Hey, stop!

424
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:18,880
Where are you going?

425
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:20,220
I'm not having shabu-shabu with you.

426
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:22,280
Uncle.

427
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:23,960
I'll have a bowl of egg noodles
with BBQ red pork and dumplings.

428
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:24,940
Hey!

429
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:26,440
"Uncle," you say?

430
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,150
It's "sis." Can you see how pretty I am?

431
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,840
I'll have a plate of BBQ red pork
with gravy and rice, sis.

432
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:35,370
Of course! Please wait, dear.

433
00:25:35,410 --> 00:25:36,850
You're so sweet, dear.

434
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,070
Huh?

435
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:41,240
You said you're having shabu-shabu.

436
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:42,820
You're at this place.

437
00:25:43,190 --> 00:25:44,370
So where else am I gonna go?

438
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:46,950
Your face is ruining my appetite.

439
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:48,760
It makes me wanna vomit.

440
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,440
Got morning sickness?

441
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:52,110
Morning sickness my ass!

442
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:55,070
You said you were gonna throw up
because of my face.

443
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:57,010
So I thought you got it.

444
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:59,240
So funny.

445
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:02,800
- Here you go!
- Oh!

446
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:04,640
- Thank you.
- Thank you, sis.

447
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:05,940
How sweet of you!

448
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:45,070
You got it for me?

449
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:46,810
What?

450
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,280
No. It wasn't me.

451
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:52,340
Oh, and...

452
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:55,120
I just wanna know you more, Nom Jued.

453
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:57,640
I saw photos of you online,

454
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,380
so I wanna meet you in person.

455
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:02,480
You really study at this faculty?

456
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:05,250
I haven't seen your face before.

457
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:07,780
I'm a junior student,

458
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,800
and you do look kinda familiar.

459
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:14,050
Are you that playboy?

460
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,430
You're being too harsh.

461
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:20,710
I'm not that type of person.

462
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,120
I'm kind-hearted

463
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,520
and sweet.

464
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:27,320
I see...

465
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:30,380
I'll be on my way then.

466
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:31,890
Hold up.

467
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:34,160
Before you go,

468
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,040
can I ask you something?

469
00:27:38,180 --> 00:27:40,460
Can I have your LINE ID?

470
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:43,620
Mom told me not to give it to strangers.

471
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:47,000
What about your Instagram?

472
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:48,740
I don't use it.

473
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:49,720
Huh?

474
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:51,540
Why are you taking so long, Nom?

475
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:52,700
You're taking...

476
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:54,200
Fucking...

477
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:57,000
My friend's been looking for me.

478
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:58,470
I've gotta go now.

479
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:09,160
Hold on. Who was that guy?

480
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,280
Hey, guys!

481
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,410
Oh, Pai.

482
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:17,100
You're late again.

483
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:20,460
I was having food.

484
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:22,970
What's with your face, though?

485
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:24,740
You look upset.

486
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,120
It's nothing.

487
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:29,480
By the way,

488
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,820
Nom Mhee Cafe is reopening soon.

489
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:33,440
Really?

490
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:34,600
Yeah.

491
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:37,440
I think it's next week.

492
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:38,330
Mm.

493
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:41,870
We can go and work there after the exam.

494
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:43,770
Let's do it together, Pai.

495
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:46,010
I probably won't return there.

496
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,910
Huh? Why?

497
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:51,750
If I were there,

498
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:53,750
I’d probably mess things up again.

499
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:55,870
Let's go to our class.

500
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:57,910
The professor will prepare us
for the exam today.

501
00:28:58,360 --> 00:28:59,100
Let's go.

502
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:13,200
Oh, hey, Nom Jued.

503
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:15,190
Hey, Nong Noey.

504
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:19,680
You're working on something?

505
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:21,710
That's right.

506
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:25,690
Whoa...

507
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:29,050
I almost didn’t recognize you
without your glasses.

508
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:31,470
That's what a lot of people say, too, actually.

509
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:33,470
You look busy.

510
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:36,160
Yeah.

511
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:38,480
I haven't worked on
the club's assignment, either.

512
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:40,240
Me too.

513
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:43,970
I still don't know what I wanna shoot

514
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:46,560
and what to borrow from the club.

515
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:48,400
Don't worry about it, Nom Jued.

516
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:51,190
I'll borrow one for you.

517
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:52,970
Thank you so much, Noey.

518
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:55,950
By the way, what are you doing here?

519
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:58,350
Phra Aek told me to meet him here.

520
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:00,430
Nom Jued.

521
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:03,180
Be honest.

522
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:05,570
You and Phra Aek

523
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:07,620
are not dating, are you?

524
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:12,550
Are you crazy?

525
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:17,200
It's not like that.

526
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:21,570
You're not falling for each other, right?

527
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:23,860
Not at all.

528
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:26,500
Where did you hear that from?

529
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:28,600
Here.

530
00:30:29,570 --> 00:30:32,830
I saw a comment under a post
about your photo,

531
00:30:33,770 --> 00:30:34,920
saying that you're in a relationship.

532
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,160
[He keeps to himself.
I guess his partner's possessive]

533
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:45,590
I'm not that type of person.

534
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:48,590
Nom Jued, let's go.

535
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:49,790
Come with me.

536
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:52,090
Where are we going, Phra Aek?

537
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:54,360
You'll find out if you come with me.

538
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,220
What...

539
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:58,400
What if this is a kidnapping?

540
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:00,560
God, I'm not gonna do that!

541
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:02,240
You still owe me.

542
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:03,420
- Let's go!
- See you later, Noey!

543
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:04,440
See you, Nom.

544
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:05,910
I'll tell you more about the shoot, okay?

545
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:06,850
Mm!

546
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,560
Why are you just standing there?

547
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:15,520
Follow me.

548
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,720
You're getting a pair of glasses?

549
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:18,950
Me?

550
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,780
You're the one getting a new pair of glasses.

551
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:22,600
No!

552
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,000
It's expensive.

553
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:25,230
I can't afford it either.

554
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:27,400
I'm also wearing contact lenses.

555
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:29,220
Come on.

556
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:30,890
Just get inside already.

557
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:31,920
Quickly.

558
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:34,440
Get inside.

559
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:36,550
Excuse me.

560
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:39,730
Get him this pair.

561
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:40,880
Sure.

562
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:43,330

Just get it.

00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,250
This is an obligation.

565
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:51,000
I don't have the money for it today.

566
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,460
Madam Mommy gave the money to me.

567
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:59,660

568
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:01,520
Yes, your Madam Mommy.

569
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:02,960
So just get one.

570
00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:05,280
This way, you can study your notes better.

571
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:10,230
- Get this pair for him, please.
- Alright.

572
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:13,010
Is this pair similar?

573
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:15,700
Here you go.

574
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:17,960
Thank you.

575
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:23,990
Try walking around first.

576
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:25,430
Right.

577
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:31,780
Is it giving you double vision
or making you dizzy?

578
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:34,530
Not at all.

579
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:39,960
Now, this is a step up.

580
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:43,160
You look as ugly as sin
without your glasses.

581
00:32:43,330 --> 00:32:44,350
Hey.

582
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,330
Don't be so harsh, Phra Aek.

583
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:50,590
Is this pair perfect?

584
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:52,760
Yes, it is.

585
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:54,840
Let me see.

586
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:57,370
Yeah, there we go.

Thank you for the new pair of glasses.

Is there anything you wanna tell me?

590
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:38,850
Nothing.

591

592

Tell me.

I'm all ears.

594
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:52,220
Is it a big deal

595
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:55,590
if I don't wear my glasses?

596
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:57,620
Well...

597
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:00,190
It's not.

598
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,780
I'd rather no one else lay their eyes on you

599
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:06,540
Why?

600
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:08,960
I just wanna change how I look.

601
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:11,489
Why am I suddenly the center of attention?

602
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:13,980
There are even mean comments about me.

603
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:17,290
I just didn't reply to them.

604
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:20,270
Why do they have to be so mean?

605
00:34:32,210 --> 00:34:33,630
It's because you're adorable.

606
00:34:39,159 --> 00:34:40,050
Really?

607
00:34:43,719 --> 00:34:46,580
About the comments...

608
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:48,480
I'll deal with them.

to get a new pair of glasses.

00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:36,770
Why didn't you bring Phrab over, too?

744
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:38,000
I did,

745
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:40,820
but he said he'd game at his own place.

746
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:42,760
I don't think he's doing that, though.

747
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:44,720
I think he's secretly studying his notes.

748
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:47,350
Yet, you're here gaming with us?

749
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:50,290
I've been preparing for the exam
since last semester.

750
00:42:51,370 --> 00:42:52,440
So the exam's gonna be a walk in the park.

751
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:54,620
You don't have a class tomorrow?

752
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:56,030
I do.

753
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:57,070
It's an early morning one,

754
00:42:58,540 --> 00:42:59,700
but I'm going there late.

755
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:01,480
Yeah, yeah.

756
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:03,080
I've got a class at 9 A.M. tomorrow.

757
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:05,160
- You can head out together with me.
- Right.

758
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:06,480
- One more game?
- Of course.

759
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:07,800
- Bring it.
- Let's go.

760
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:09,640
- Pass it to me.
- See that?

761
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:10,510
I forgot!

762
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:13,440
- Yeah!
- How about that?

763
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:15,800
- Come on! Pass it to me.
- Quickly! Run.

764
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:17,260
- I'm doing a diagonal pass.
- Quickly.

765
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:44,210
Shit!

766
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:45,760
God damn it!

767
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:47,480
Oh, fuck.

768
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:52,330
Hello.

769
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:54,680
Hurry up. The Professor is pissed.

770
00:43:54,710 --> 00:43:55,830
She's giving us a quiz.

771
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:57,480
Fucking hell!

772
00:43:57,520 --> 00:43:58,420
Right.

773
00:44:05,290 --> 00:44:06,530
Whoa!

774
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:22,800
With this...

775
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:24,840
What kind of relationship do you wanna be in?

776
00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:27,240
If you say "friends."

777
00:44:27,930 --> 00:44:29,160
Friends don't do that, though.

778
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:33,340
It's said that if we get the same number
from the fortune stick

779
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:35,250
it means we're destined to be together.

780
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:39,380
I know that you're hitting on him.

781
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:41,680
I have a crush on Phra Aek.
