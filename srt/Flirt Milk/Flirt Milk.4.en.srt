I don't think that matters.

132
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,120
And...

133
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,410
What have you done to your face, Shorty?

134
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:27,440
I've been using my go-to
Star Lab PRO SKIN facial cream.

135
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,160
It's great. It deeply nourishes the skin.

Everyone's using it.

137
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:34,880

Had I not stopped you,

143
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,280
you would've already kissed him.

144
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:51,860
Calm down, Phrab.

145
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:55,280
Phra Aek probably didn't have that idea.

146
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,770

147
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,990
Even with a new haircut,

148
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:02,000
he still has the same habits as always.

149
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,640

Uh.

Hey...

165
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:33,250
I can't let him go like that.

Come and revise
the assignment with me first.

- Mm!

170
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:43,980
- We can do that later.
- Hurry!

171
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,800
- Wait! No!
- Come on!

172

You, of course.

176

Mm...

178

After taking your glasses off,
and with your new hairstyle,

179
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:27,540
you look more handsome.

180
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:29,680

181

Mm.

182

It's cool, though.

183
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:35,780
I'm gonna take care of you today,

184
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:41,000

walking around here.

185
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,480
I need to use the bathroom.

186
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,560
Sure.

187
00:11:45,010 --> 00:11:47,910
Meet me here after class, okay?

188
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:53,810
What's with the hurry, man?

189
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:00,400
Get inside!

190
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,600
Don't...

191
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:02,640
Just get inside.

192
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,720
Let me go!

193
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,480
What are you trying to do, Phra Aek?
That really hurt!

194
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:12,030
- What's going on? I need to go to my class.
- Hey.

195
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,900
Why are you covering my face with a bag?

196
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,450
Just keep it on.

197
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:23,870
You think this is funny?

198
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,820
I'll cut down on the debt.

199
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:30,760
No.

200
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:32,910
If this is what it takes,
I'm not doing it.

201
00:12:33,290 --> 00:12:35,180
You're bullying me way too much.

202
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,120
Yeah, right.

203
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,640
You're heading to your faculty, right?

204
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:43,880
It's about to rain, you know?

205
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:44,920
You're gonna get soaked.

206
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,740
Huh? It's gonna rain?

207
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:49,440
Yes, it is.

208
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:52,760
Right...

209
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:55,850
Thank you, Phra Aek.

210
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:58,280
I'm off to my class then.

211
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,390
Right. Watch your step, okay?

212
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:02,100
- Mm.
- Don't take it off, okay?

213
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:06,100
This should protect me from the rain, right?

214
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:28,160
Hi, Pai.

215
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:29,360
What are you doing?

216
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,970
It's a good thing that it didn't rain.

217
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,640
I hastily made my way to the class, too.

218
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:36,280
What rain?

219
00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:39,480
Phra Aek told me that it was gonna rain.

220
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:41,230
That's why he got me this plastic bag.

221
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:44,050
He was probably worried I'd get soaked.

222
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
What's he trying to do now?

223
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,950
And where are your glasses?

224
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:53,460
Don't tell me that
Phra Aek took them from you.

225
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:56,640
I've already told you

226
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,290
that they were broken.

227
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,880
I texted Phrab,

228
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:03,030
and he said he had no pair to spare for me.

229
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:05,240
That's why I'm wearing contact lenses.

230
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,300
I can piece it together now.

231
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:11,940
About what?

232
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,180
It's nothing.

233
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:18,080
Just stay away from Phra Aek.

234
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:29,680
[Let's meet at the same bar tonight
to celebrate the new club members]

235
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:35,720
"Promise me that you will not drink, smoke,

236
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,670
and be with bad guys."

237
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,710
Okay, students.

238
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:45,450
Welcome to the Photography class.

239
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:50,200
In today's class, we'll be learning
about color schemes and composition.

240
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:53,320
[Oh, wow! So cute!]

241
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:54,520
Damn it!

242
00:14:55,990 --> 00:14:56,790
Hey.

243
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,110
What the hell is wrong with you?

244
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:01,400
God...

245
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:06,000
What faculty is that guy studying at?

246
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:07,830
Huh?

247
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:10,550
If you're curious,
just visit his profile page.

248
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:14,440
I think he's an IT student.

249
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:15,540
You think?

250
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:17,250
Why do you wanna know?

251
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:21,420
He commented on a post about Nom Jued,

252
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:24,120
saying "So cute,"

253
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,650
"I love you. Can I date you?"

254
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,130
"Are you single?"

255
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,140
Look at him.

256
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,040
Oh, really?

257
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:35,140
Are you that possessive of him?

258
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:37,870
You're his father or something?

259
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:40,320
I'm not his father.

260
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,240
I'm his...

261
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:46,120
His boyfriend?

262
00:15:47,370 --> 00:15:48,230
Ow!

263
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,280
Shush!

264
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:54,270
Oh, my...

265
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:56,640
Love really changes people, doesn't it?

266
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:00,080
You skip classes

267
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:02,070
just so you can see that lovely face of his.

268
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:04,030
God, what a mess.

269
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:06,120
I'm such a good example.

270
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,360
Pai, Pai.

271
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:13,520
Look.

272
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:15,440
A photo of me
is on the faculty's Facebook page.

273
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,050
Let me see.

274
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:19,770
What?

275
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:21,880
Who posted it?

276
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,460
Yeah.

277
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,480
Who took the photo?

278
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,220
It's of high quality, too.

279
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:28,440
I'm so confused.

280
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:29,880
What does the caption say?

281
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:31,950
"Spotted a cutie

282
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:33,910
with a cool fashion sense."

283
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,040
Whoa!

284
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:41,810
It's got so many likes and comments, too.

285
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:43,440
Let me see.

286
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:45,160
What do people think about it?

287
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:48,600
For the most part, they're compliments, actually.

288
00:16:48,630 --> 00:16:51,050
However, there are some creepy ones.

289
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:54,370
Pai.

290
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,120
I'm scared.

291
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:58,920
Will they do something to me?

292
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:01,700
What's to be scared of?

293
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,310
Keep your chest up!

294
00:17:04,359 --> 00:17:05,079
Chest up!

295
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:08,599
- Yeah.
- Keep my chest up?

296
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:09,640
We're the handsome boys.

297
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:10,339
Here.

298
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:38,160
Why are people still staring at me, Pai?

299
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:45,060
Just ignore them.

300
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:49,480
I'm happy that I've got a handsome friend.

301
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:52,000
Huh? Who?

302
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:53,960
Whatever.

303
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:55,930
Dig in.

304
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:00,110
Mm.

305
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:02,480
The food here is great.

306
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:07,040
Hmm...

307
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:10,830
- Am I the handsome one?
- God, this is driving me insane.

308
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:12,640
Move.

309
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:15,420
- You're late.
- Oh, Phrab.

310
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:18,180
My professor called it a day so late.

311
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:21,620
I shouldn't have enrolled in weird subjects.

312
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:24,120
I should've stuck with you guys.

313
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:25,510
See? I told you.

314
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,200
You didn't believe me.

315
00:18:28,910 --> 00:18:29,670
Hey.

316
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:31,460
Hi, Phra Aek.

317
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:34,970
Why did you take the bag off?

318
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,520
Well, it's not raining.

319
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:38,360
It is.

320
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,430
The forecast said it's gonna rain.

321
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:41,920
Hey, bastard.

322
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:42,760
My name is Phra Aek.

323
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:43,680
Hey, Phra Ass.

324
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:45,990
What part of your brain makes you think that

325
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:47,350
you can screw around with my friend?

326
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:48,880
Huh?

327
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,700
What's with the bag nonsense?

328
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:52,730
Nobody would do such a thing.

329
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,390
It's a common thing in my neighborhood.

330
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:55,510
Piss off.

331
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:57,500
Just look at him.

332
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,080
What?

333
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:04,700
I don't know how Madam Mommy
let him go out and about by himself.

334
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,880
Hey, hey!

335
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,140
What do you have to do with him?

336
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:13,240
I'm the one convincing his mom
to let him the contact lenses.

337
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,700
Why are you being so nosy, huh?

338
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,650
You didn't take care of your friends at all.

339
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,040
We didn't, huh?

340
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,160
Uh... How about we all just calm down?

341
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:24,760
Please calm down, Brothers.

342
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:26,830
We always take care of him, Buddy.

343
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,450
You said we didn't, huh?

344
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:31,330
We never let pesky bastards lay eyes on him,

345
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:33,840
and you're the first to leave.

346
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,360
- Me?
- Yeah.

347
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,250
Me?

348
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:39,430
Then, look at this.

349
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:43,600
Look at what this comment says.

350
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:44,720
Look at it!

351
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,520
Okay, now I've seen it.

352
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,960
This is pissing me off.

353
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,370
Should we get him?

354
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:54,260
Yeah, let's do it.

355
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:55,630
You've got the stuff, right?

356
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:56,440
Yes.

357
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:57,850
Grab whatever you can.

358
00:20:01,150 --> 00:20:02,050
Brothers,

359
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:03,800
let's calm down.

360
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:06,880
Let's make him pay.

361
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:08,040
Uh...

362
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,490
You have to thank me

363
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:12,410
for taking care of him this well, though.

364
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:13,800
Thank my ass.

365
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:18,760
Ouch!

366
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:21,640
You're getting carried away, aren't you?

367
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,320
And you said you were gonna join me.

368
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:24,590
Who said we'd do that?

369
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,190
Come on.

370
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:27,720
How upsetting.

371
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:32,040
Hey.

372
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:32,880
Hm?

373
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:35,330
Why does it have to be like this?

374
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:38,560
Everything's been fine,

375
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,680
except for one thing.

376
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:42,760
She's a nude model

377
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:47,200
Why?

378
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:49,230
You're not okay with that?

379
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:52,000
Would you be fine with

380
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:57,300
seeing people staring at nude photos
of your lover in public?

381
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,160
I just can't.

382
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,670
You're still not her lover, though.

383
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:08,680
Aww, I know.

384
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:11,120
She's my future lover.

385
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:13,840
You're going off the rails,

386
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:14,760
making no sense.

387
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,240
Think about it.

388
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:20,960
Be honest.

389
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,870
Are you happy being with her?

390
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:34,480
Mm...

391
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:36,450
Yeah.

392
00:21:38,610 --> 00:21:39,450
Well...

393
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:47,470
It'd really make me happy

394
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,530
if you were to enjoy this cup.

395
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:56,420
I didn't order this.

396
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:04,880
I told you to enjoy it.

397
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:06,630
Leave a review, too.

398
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:13,770
This course of action violates Section 309.

399
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:18,360
Extortion against someone

400
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,890
to compel them to do their bidding

401
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,360
or obligate them

402
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:26,570
to act under hostility,

403
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:29,490
jeopardizing their livelihood,

404
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:32,900
will, freedom,

405
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:36,440
fame, or assets

406
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:42,970
shall be punished with at least
three years of imprisonment

407
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:47,170
and a fine of up to 60,000 baht,

408
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:51,780
or both imprisonment and a fine.

409
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:56,720
What about the comment
about the taste of the drink?

410
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,460
Do you think that's fair?

411
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:04,370
- Huh?
- What comment?

412
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:12,760
Here.

413
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:23,850
Don't customers have the right
to voice their opinions?

414
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,440
It's fine if it's just that.

415
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,280
But you had over a thousand people
review-bombing this place

416
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:32,400
What's the deal with that?

417
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:33,860
Huh?

418
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,680
I don't know what your thoughts are on this,

419
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:43,490
but as a regular customer,

420
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,520
I still enjoy this place.

421
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:49,860
However, I'm now beginning to be unsure

422
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:51,950
if that is still the case.

423
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:56,780
I'm also not sure
if I'd like to study my notes here.

424
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:00,040
Who cares if you don't come here?

425
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,800
We don't want a bad customer
like you here anyway.

426
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:06,960
Let's leave, Jan.

427
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,000
Yeah, get out!

428
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:13,670
Don't you ever come back here.

429
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,170
Do whatever you want

430
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:18,830
and don't delete
whatever you've posted, too.

431
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:20,290
Just make this place crash and burn.

432
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,200
Oh, hi, Nom Jued.

433
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:04,470
You're here as well?

434
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:06,240
Mm.

435
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:10,280
But I'm debating
whether or not I should go in.

436
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,170
Let's go inside and have fun!

437
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:17,820
I've never had a drink,

438
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:19,780
and I'm hesitant to do so.

439
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:21,140
Hey.

440
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:22,880
I've never had a drink either.

441
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:24,540
I wanna try, though.

442
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,740
Nobody would force us to drink,

443
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:30,640
right?

444
00:25:30,830 --> 00:25:32,560
Mm. Maybe.

445
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,230
Let's get inside.

446
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:35,200
Let's go.

447
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:41,040
Hey! I said no!

448
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:42,080
Don't be shy.

449
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:43,360
- Come here!
- Hey!

450
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:45,310
Chat! Hey!

451
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:46,730
Hello, everyone.

452
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:52,190
Let's make some noise for Phra Aek!

453
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:54,920
Why are you putting me on the spot like this?

454
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:57,050
Come on!
Everyone is eager to make noises for you!

455
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:58,040
Listen.

456
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:02,720
They wanna see what the top dog
of the sophomores is like.

457
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:04,230
Isn't that right, guys?!

458
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:06,370
See?

459
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:09,680
Who would like to hear Phra Aek sing?

460
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:10,900
Yeah!

461
00:26:10,930 --> 00:26:12,920
See? They're all excited.

462
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:13,930
Come on.

463
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:44,280
♫Feeling starstruck, my eyes wide open♫

464
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:49,900
♫You look better than before, baby♫

465
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:56,550
♫From ordinary,
it all becomes so extraordinary,♫

466
00:26:56,590 --> 00:27:01,230
♫As you and I are making history♫

467
00:27:01,270 --> 00:27:06,820
♫What if things have completely changed,♫

468
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:10,000
♫And what if it's beyond what we've expected?♫

469
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:11,440
[Phra Rong Review: What happened to Nom Mhee Cafe?
The drinks taste worse, and the service is poor]

470
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:17,070
♫I don't care what's going to happen next♫

471
00:27:17,110 --> 00:27:23,950
♫I've got to tell you what I want to express♫

472

♫You're the best thing I've ever wished for♫

478
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:55,110
You’re already this drunk?

479
00:27:59,080 --> 00:27:59,950
Yeah.

480
00:28:01,950 --> 00:28:03,550
Nobody likes a drunk person.

481
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:09,760
I do, though.

482
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:16,240
You're ridiculous.

483
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:20,290
You're drunk as a skunk, you know?

484
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
Are you good?

485
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:40,640
Thank you

486
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,550
for staying by my side.

487
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:48,370
Mm.

488
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:51,850
I'm also happy that you're with me.

489
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:55,490
Let's head home.

490
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:57,960
We've gotta go now.

491
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:01,270
Text me how much we've gotta pay, okay?

492
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:02,440
Let's go, Beauty.

493
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,080
You good?

494
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:27,080
Are you messing with me?

495
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:30,170
I'm sorry, Pued.

496
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:33,120
If I've done anything that upsets you,

497
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:35,390
just say it to my face.

498
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:37,090
I don't wanna keep it in my chest anymore.

499
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:40,670
You're a cheater,

500
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,930
and there's nothing I can do about it.

501
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:45,290
What cheater?

502
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,300
Just look at you.

503
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:50,040
You wanna take photos,

504
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:51,680
but you've got no skills.

505
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:54,380
Yet, you got to work with Korn,
the President of the Club.

506
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:59,000
You were close to Phra Aek
way before you joined the club, right?

507
00:29:59,670 --> 00:30:02,160
Just admit that you asked him to
take photos for you.

508
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:05,410
There’s no way
you actually know photography.

509
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:10,880
I don't even know if I do it myself.

510
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:11,950
However...

511
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:16,400
I took all of the photos myself.

512
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:17,720
Liar.

513
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:20,080
It's unfair regardless.

514
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:24,000
You're not passionate about anything,

515
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:25,720
but you got accepted anyway.

516
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:29,730
Meanwhile, my friend,
who is both talented and passionate,

517
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,120
got rejected.

518
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:33,310
It's because of cheaters like you!

519
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:34,880
It's so unfair!

520
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:41,500
I have no clue about what you said.

521
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:43,770
If I made you upset in any way,

522
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:45,630
I'm truly sorry.

523
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:48,760
But I do really put a lot of work into them.

524
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:50,020
You do?

525
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:51,720
Jued!

526
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:53,720
- Hey!
- Pued.

527
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:05,350
Korn.

528
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:07,160
I'll take care of him from here.

529
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,080
Let's go, Nom Jued.

530
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:40,410
Here.

531
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:44,920
Have a drink first.

532
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:58,580
Are you good?

533
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:01,400
Kinda.

534
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:08,910
Phra Aek.

535
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:10,860
My phone battery's dying.

536
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:13,280
Oh.

537
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:17,950
Here.

538
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:24,810
There.

539
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:27,120
It's yours.

540
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:31,310
Why did you give it to me?

541
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:32,880
Well...

542
00:32:34,070 --> 00:32:38,120
What would I do if you pretended
that your phone died and ditched me?

543
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:42,880
Phra Aek!

544
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:44,960
I fucking swear that I won't ditch you!

545
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:46,870
Why are you this bossy, huh?!

546
00:32:47,430 --> 00:32:48,710
Is there something blocking your ears?

547
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:49,990
Hey...

548
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:52,990
You're being harsh on me now?

549
00:32:57,570 --> 00:32:58,600
I'm sorry.

550
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:01,280
I often hear you use this tone of voice.

551
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,930
I just wanna try and see what it's like.

552
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:04,670
Oh, you!

553
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:07,920
Here.

554
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:09,000
Put your stuff here.

555
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:22,400
Before hitting the road,

556
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:26,530
safety first, okay?

557
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:27,580
Huh?

558
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:33,840
Ready?

559
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:36,640
All good.

560
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:39,480
Alright. Let's head home.

561
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:20,889
Hey.

562
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:22,480
Get inside the house already.

563
00:34:26,250 --> 00:34:28,239
My face is still very warm.

564
00:34:30,199 --> 00:34:33,040
Can I have a rest for a minute first?

565
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:37,250
My mom would spank me
if she saw me like this.

566
00:34:37,820 --> 00:34:39,139
Sure, have a seat.

567
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:56,900
Let me see.

568
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:00,080
Touch it.

569
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:29,930
Why does Pued hate me so much?

570
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:32,740
I'm not like what he said at all.

571
00:35:33,410 --> 00:35:37,050
Maybe I shouldn't have joined
the club in the first place.

572
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:40,070
I should've joined the science club
like what my mom wanted

573
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:43,100
and followed my dad's career path.

574
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:47,960
Calm down, Nom.

575
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:50,900
You didn't do anything to him first, right?

576
00:35:58,240 --> 00:35:59,380
Well, I think I didn't.

577
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,080
Oh!

578
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:06,180
Maybe it was when I bumped into him,
dropping his work?

579
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:07,720
It was when I went to the library.

580
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:10,120
What work?

581
00:36:12,460 --> 00:36:17,270
It was something attached to a laptop.

582
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:21,330
I think it's called an eternal drive
or something.

583
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:22,960
God...

584
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:25,690
That's why he's mad at you.

585
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:28,360
Really?

586
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:31,520
I even apologized to him, though.

587
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:32,900
I didn't mean to do any of that.

588
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:38,040
Maybe he didn't like you in the first place.

589
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:41,940
I'll...

590
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:44,920
I'll deal with him.

591
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:58,080
Why do people like to judge others

592
00:36:58,120 --> 00:37:00,200
and label them,

593
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:04,500
despite not knowing anything about them?

594
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:14,020
That's what they think.

595
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:17,280
We can't stop it.

596
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:24,160
You're right.

597
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:30,560
If people don't know something inside out,

598
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:33,880
they won't be able to see
other aspects of it clearly.

599
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:37,130
What the hell are you saying?

600
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:40,730
That's what my professor taught me.

601
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:46,740
However, you're different, Phra Aek,

602
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:48,480
and that makes me happy.

603
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:52,120
Wait, are you...

604
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:55,060
Are you actually that type of person, too?

605
00:37:58,040 --> 00:37:59,040
I don't know.

606
00:38:00,210 --> 00:38:02,790
I can't answer that.

607
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:10,960
I do believe that you're different, though.

608
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:14,440
It's just that you bark a lot.

609
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:15,480
Hey!

610
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,410
Who taught you to say things like that?

611
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:18,600
It's Satrupai.

612
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:27,010
Don't be mad at me, okay?

613
00:38:38,750 --> 00:38:41,240
If it wasn't you who saved me,

614
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,700
it could've been much worse for me.

615
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:46,690
Thank you very much,

616
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:48,790
Phra Aek, the kind.

617
00:38:53,330 --> 00:38:54,190
Right.

618
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:56,950
Just tell me when you need help.

619
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,000
And...

620
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:06,270
I'll reimburse you as soon as I can, okay?

621
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:12,110
Even if you manage that,

622
00:39:14,330 --> 00:39:15,750
I'll still help you anyway.

623
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:25,570
Thanks for letting me hug you.

624
00:39:33,990 --> 00:39:35,370
Just tell me if you need it.

625
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:38,700
I'm always up for a hug.

626
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:52,440
Oh!

627
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:56,700
My face is no longer too warm.

628
00:39:58,320 --> 00:39:59,320
I'll...

629
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:01,240
I'll head inside now, okay?

630
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:03,200
Right. Just hurry up already.

631
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:05,520
Have a safe ride home, okay?

632
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:07,360
Mm! Get inside.

633
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:12,440
Bye-bye.

634
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:22,200
Why is my face suddenly so warm?

635
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:29,520
What's wrong with me?

636
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:40,000
Hey! Phra Aek!

637
00:40:40,030 --> 00:40:41,720
I'm sorry! I didn't mean it!

638
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:43,240
Don't be so pretentious.

639
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:45,080
You broke Nom Jued's glasses, right?

640
00:40:45,110 --> 00:40:47,210
Pued! You!

641
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,720
Ah!

642
00:40:53,110 --> 00:40:57,760
Another interaction caused by
the magnetic movement of the two particles

643
00:40:57,880 --> 00:41:00,040
is similar to that of
two magnets facing each other.

644
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:02,800
Hey, Nom.

645
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:05,530
It's Pai, isn't it?

646
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:07,800
Huh?

647
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:09,310
What's going on?

648
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:10,700
Look at him.

649
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:12,520
He's in hot water again.

650
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:17,360
Whoa...

651
00:41:17,930 --> 00:41:21,820
The background music for the video
also really emphasizes the message.

652
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:26,620
He can't keep going around messing
with people like this.

653
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:29,460
They might think he's a thug,

654
00:41:30,190 --> 00:41:31,440
not a student.

655
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:35,610
What makes you think that he always does it?

656
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:37,820
It's possible that he did

657
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:40,270
because he wanna prove that

658
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:43,150
the drink that he made tasted good.

659
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:46,560
God...

660
00:41:47,740 --> 00:41:49,380
You're so optimistic.

661
00:41:50,020 --> 00:41:51,110
Of all the people?

662
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:58,680
Still...

663
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:01,990
He's not someone
who'd mess with others first.

664
00:42:04,140 --> 00:42:05,710
But just look at the video.

665
00:42:07,220 --> 00:42:09,760
People would still think that he started it.

666
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:40,140
Took you long enough.

667
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:42,170
I got up late.

668
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:54,680
Nom.

669
00:42:57,260 --> 00:42:58,470
What is it, Pai?

670
00:43:01,490 --> 00:43:02,480
Just take it.

671
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:05,270
This is as much as I can do.

672
00:43:15,020 --> 00:43:16,790
What happened?

673
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:30,120
Let's put this behind us.

674
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:32,900
I think you should find a job
that suits you better.

675
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:34,490
- But...
- Hey!

676
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:36,380
No more words.

677
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:37,680
I don't wanna hear anything from you.

678
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:57,320
Whose wallet is this?

679
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:15,720
Right...

680
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:18,960
So you're a law student.

681
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:21,470
You're gonna have a piece of me.

682
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:24,280
Yeah.

683
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:25,950
If I see his face,

684
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:27,570
I'm gonna teach him a lesson.

685
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:30,010
I've got nothing to lose anyway.

686
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:33,480
Since electrons and protons
are particles in which...

687
00:44:34,090 --> 00:44:36,330
- What's with him?
- Who the hell is he?

688
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:39,840
Brother.

689
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:43,230
I'm sorry for upsetting you.

690
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:44,340
I...

691
00:44:44,610 --> 00:44:45,900
I spiked your drink.

692
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:47,760
I've learned my lesson!

693
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:48,900
It's okay, Pued.

694
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:51,700
What happened to you, though?

695
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:54,600
I beg you.

696
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:57,070
I no longer have anything
against you, actually.

697
00:44:58,160 --> 00:44:59,480
Really?

698
00:44:59,510 --> 00:45:00,890
Thank you very much.

699
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,150
And...

700
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:06,760
Who did this to you?

701
00:45:12,740 --> 00:45:14,100
- Was it Phra Aek?
- Ah!

702
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,100
Phra Aek?!

703
00:45:17,500 --> 00:45:18,460
Phra Aek!

704
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:24,480
Seriously?

705
00:45:25,140 --> 00:45:27,560
Is there really a sane art student?

706
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:29,560
There's one.

707
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:31,720
- Who?
- His name is Korn.

708
00:45:32,450 --> 00:45:35,760
I've heard that there's something going on
between you and him,

709
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:36,680
Nom Jued.

710
00:45:38,680 --> 00:45:39,960
Is there?

711
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:43,240
- Sheesh!
- Oh, he's flustered as well.

712
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:45,560
No!

713
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:48,540
There's nothing going on.

714
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:50,520
Really?

715
00:45:50,700 --> 00:45:51,720
Let's leave.

716
00:45:56,040 --> 00:45:57,250
Who just texted me?

717
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,360
[Kornthep: For the Photography Club's
new project,]

718
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:03,600
[Kornthep: please drop by the club
today or tomorrow

719
00:46:03,640 --> 00:46:04,840
to pick up your assignment]

720
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:12,210
"Please," he says?

721
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:13,560
Take that.

722
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:21,870
Wait, you're not done?

723
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:23,110
Almost.

724
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:28,140
Don't tell me that
you're throwing all of these away.

725
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:29,980
We can at least sell them, no?

726
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:32,360
Who's gonna buy them?

727
00:46:34,520 --> 00:46:37,380
If that's the case, can I have one for myself?

728
00:46:41,320 --> 00:46:42,060
Go ahead.

729
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:45,960
By the way,

730
00:46:46,300 --> 00:46:50,810
you haven't told me what each photo means.

731
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:52,630
Mm...

732
00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:55,460
I don't know it either.

733
00:46:59,360 --> 00:47:00,800
You have to interpret them yourself.

734
00:47:01,110 --> 00:47:02,560
I just used my feelings.

735
00:47:02,680 --> 00:47:03,880
You knew that, didn't you?

736
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:05,620
Even the professor didn't understand.

737
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:07,130
Really?

738
00:47:07,640 --> 00:47:10,430
I did, actually.

739
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:13,920
It's like each photo can actually draw me into it.

740
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:16,360
You're kidding me.

741
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:19,240
It's true. I'm not joking.

742
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:23,380
Into the pile.

743
00:47:24,120 --> 00:47:25,210
Go back to your class!

744
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:27,870
Honestly,

745
00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:30,280
they look way better than my nude photos.

746
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:33,230
So you're gonna pivot to my style?

747
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:34,770
Nope.

748
00:47:35,080 --> 00:47:36,510
I'm fine with doing nude photos.

749
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:38,460
But I'll take a step further.

750
00:47:42,680 --> 00:47:43,540
All into the pile.

751
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:51,640
Well...

752
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:53,880
Let me keep one.

753
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:55,760
Mm.

754
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:57,410
Take as many as you'd like.

755
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:01,270
The pile is mine, then.

756
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:02,850
I'm gonna sell them.

757
00:48:04,360 --> 00:48:06,200
Share the profit with me, too.
I'm the photographer here.

758
00:48:07,080 --> 00:48:07,820
No promises.

759
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:09,280
I've gotta go now.

760
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:10,400
See you.

761
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:31,270
- Wanna drink?
- Yeah, let's go.

762
00:48:31,310 --> 00:48:33,000
It's been so long. I'm thirsty.

763
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:33,760
Let's go.

764
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:35,530
Hey. Is that Pai?

765
00:48:35,720 --> 00:48:36,840
Yeah, it's him.

766
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,000
Hey, Pai!

767
00:48:39,820 --> 00:48:41,480
Oh, hi. What's up, Nine and Ten?

768
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:43,320
What are you doing at my college?

769
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:45,290
- Yeah.
- You're looking for a girl or something?

770
00:48:45,560 --> 00:48:46,820
Look at you.

771
00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:48,560
You've been drinking hard or what?

772
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:50,560
What drinking?

773
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:53,510
I both work and study.

774
00:48:53,720 --> 00:48:54,720
It's so hard.

775
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:56,480
What do you do, though?

776
00:48:58,200 --> 00:48:59,200
It's best you don't know it.

777
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:01,280
I quit the job.

778
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:03,270
Anyway, we just finished our exam.

779
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:05,100
Are you free to drink tonight?

780
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:06,880
Let's go!

781
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:09,680
It's been so long.

782
00:49:09,840 --> 00:49:10,840
I'm so thirsty.

783
00:49:11,720 --> 00:49:13,640
By the way, where are you guys going?

784
00:49:13,770 --> 00:49:14,640
To a mall.

785
00:49:14,680 --> 00:49:15,480
Wanna join us?

786
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:16,290
Sure!

787
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:18,120
Look at you.

788
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:21,670
You're way too agreeable;
I bet you're heartbroken!

789
00:49:23,490 --> 00:49:24,520
Heartbroken my ass.

790
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:26,100
- I bet he is.
- You're heartbroken.

791
00:49:26,120 --> 00:49:27,830
- It's because you are!
- I bet!

792
00:49:32,980 --> 00:49:34,660
Hey, I'm so sorry.

793
00:49:36,330 --> 00:49:38,280
Took you forever.

794
00:49:38,510 --> 00:49:39,730
We're supposed to meet here at 9 P.M.,

795
00:49:39,900 --> 00:49:41,120
but you got here at 10.30 P.M.?

796
00:49:41,380 --> 00:49:44,100
The traffic at the college was insane.

797
00:49:45,620 --> 00:49:46,440
Serve yourself a drink.

798
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:47,280
Right.

799
00:50:08,120 --> 00:50:09,280
Where's Nine?

800
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:11,720
He's waiting for
his Greek life member outside.

801
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:13,720
He wants to bring them here.

802
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:15,790
His Greek life member is coming as well?

803
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:16,990
Yeah.

804
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:19,030
Is she pretty?

805
00:50:20,840 --> 00:50:21,760
It's a guy.

806
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:24,900
Damn it.

807
00:50:26,360 --> 00:50:28,470
You guys don't have a sorority member at all?

808
00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:31,080
No, it's a curse among our friend group.

809
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:36,000
Sorry, I’m here now.

810
00:50:37,240 --> 00:50:38,240
Speaking of the devil...

811
00:50:38,500 --> 00:50:40,520
You're clinking your glasses without me?

812
00:50:40,560 --> 00:50:42,370
- Here!
- Cheers!

813
00:50:44,560 --> 00:50:45,220
Oh.

814
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:47,200
Where is your Greek life member?

815
00:50:47,240 --> 00:50:48,240
He's on his way.

816
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:49,960
Here he is.

817
00:50:51,880 --> 00:50:52,780
Hello.

818
00:51:00,270 --> 00:51:01,270
Right, right.

819
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:02,560
This is Ten.

820
00:51:02,600 --> 00:51:03,800
But I think you already knew that.

821
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:05,150
That's Pai.

822
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:06,580
He's from a different college.

823
00:51:07,080 --> 00:51:08,770
This is one of my Greek life members.
His name is Phra Rong.

824
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:14,640
So we meet again.

825
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:18,480
You two know each other?

826
00:51:18,840 --> 00:51:19,660
- Yes.
- No!

827
00:51:25,360 --> 00:51:28,400
We've seen each other at cafes.

828
00:51:28,760 --> 00:51:29,760
We've only seen each other.

829
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:32,400
So do you know him?

830
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:33,720
I don't.

831
00:51:37,060 --> 00:51:38,160
No worries.

832
00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:40,330
Even though, right now, he doesn't,

833
00:51:41,180 --> 00:51:45,600
I'm sure we'll know each other more soon.

834
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:51,730
How long are you staying here?

835
00:51:58,040 --> 00:51:59,040
I'll be right back.

836
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:08,080
Hey! Chill out!

837
00:52:08,120 --> 00:52:08,880
You're breezing through the liquor.

838
00:52:09,160 --> 00:52:09,990
Whatever.

839
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:12,650
Your lunch got stolen or something?

840
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:28,180
Hey, can I have a cigarette?

841
00:52:40,620 --> 00:52:41,980
I'm out.

842
00:52:42,840 --> 00:52:44,120
Are you messing with me?

843
00:52:46,600 --> 00:52:47,270
Yes?

844
00:52:49,560 --> 00:52:51,090
Do you think acting so damn polite

845
00:52:51,540 --> 00:52:53,240
makes you a good person?

846
00:52:54,120 --> 00:52:57,000
It never gets rid of the fact that
you ruined the reputation of the cafe.

847
00:52:57,380 --> 00:52:58,560
What did I do?

848
00:52:59,720 --> 00:53:00,630
As for the comments,

849
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:02,720
I've already deleted all of them.

850
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:05,530
Your friends still posted the video.

851
00:53:06,840 --> 00:53:07,640
The video?

852
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:10,200
What video?

853
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:12,410
You're messing with me or something?

854
00:53:15,080 --> 00:53:15,880
Yes.

855
00:53:17,120 --> 00:53:18,120
Thank you.

856
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:20,140
Fucking...

857
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:26,680
He barks like a dog.

858
00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:38,800
Hey, stop shooting!

859
00:53:40,600 --> 00:53:41,810
You're doing this again.

860
00:53:43,240 --> 00:53:44,780
Is it a big deal

861
00:53:46,580 --> 00:53:48,120
if I don’t wear my glasses?

862
00:53:48,680 --> 00:53:50,520
I'd rather no one else lay their eyes on you
