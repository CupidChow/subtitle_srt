can you guys do it?

How can we be sure that you two will make it?

108
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,640

110
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:53,520

will treat us indifferently, no?

111

112
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:02,840

00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,280
I want to be with Phra Aek,

117
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,240
and I'd like to stay in this relationship.

118
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,520
I'd like to dismiss your request as well.

119
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:26,000
If you ask us

120
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,520
whether or not we'd make it,

121
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:31,800
I must be honest that

122
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:34,020
I do not know.

123
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:36,799
However,

124
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,200
as for the prejudice,

125
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,600
that is beyond my control.

126
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:49,880

140

This looks amazing.

171

Since when did you learn cooking?

172
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,320
Cooking?

173
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:59,160
Well, it was when I saved up
for my first camera.

174
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,920
I learned to cook
when I worked at a restaurant.

175
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,200
Whoa.

176
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:09,560

00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:51,760
Come and get the room all tidied up.

186
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,160
Can we stay like this for just a little longer?

187
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:08,880
Phra Aek. Here's the final payment.

188
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,040
So now that you've paid your debt,

189
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,640
do you still want to be with me?

190
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,840
No. I wanna be with Kornthep.

191
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,880
Wait, no!

192
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:24,520
Why did you say that?

193
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:28,240
I'm kidding. It was a joke.

194
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,600
It's you who I wanna be with.

195
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:33,400
Promise?

196
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:37,120
You're so sweet.

197
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:41,800
Whoa!

198
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:49,050
Should I reconsider my thoughts?

199
00:14:49,090 --> 00:14:50,160
Stop it!

200
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,520
- Are you still gonna leave me after this?
- No, I won't leave you!

201
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,120
- I'm kidding!
- Whose heart do you belong to?

202
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,120
- You, of course!
- To whom?

203
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:56,320
- You belong to me, right?
- Yeah.

204
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,920
You can stay here with me only for now.

205
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:10,560
I feel bad seeing you riding back and forth.

206
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:13,110
Yes. Thank you.

207
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:18,680
Yeah, learn to be nicer
while staying with me.

208
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,160
Help me with the chores, too.

209
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:24,240
Yes! Understood!

210
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,640
Are you and your mom on good terms now?

211
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,240
Not yet.

212
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:02,800
Have you called her at all?

213
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,480
I'll call her later.

214
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:15,080
I think she must be missing you, for sure.

215
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,440
How clever.

216
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:19,160
That's just how it goes.

217
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:21,920
Just put your luggage away already.

218
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:23,920
Righto!

219
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:01,120
What's with the headache?!

220
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:08,240
Maybe it's because
you never stop watching soccer.

221
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,200
Yes, that's exactly why.

222
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:26,120
Whatever. My head hurts.

223
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,000
Let me give you a massage.

224
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,400
Is it better now?

225
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:41,040
Mm, a little bit harder.

226
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:43,520
- That's the spot.
- Feeling better now?

227
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,600
Slower and more gentle.

228
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:47,640
That's it.

229
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,160
This is so good.

230
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:55,820
Yeah.

231
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:59,440
By the way, you prepared the dish for me?

232
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:01,400
Mm.

233
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:03,520
Just have it without me.

234
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:07,120
What are you gonna have, though?

235
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:10,120
Just have it first.

236
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:11,800
I'll have the leftovers.

237
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:25,400
Whoa.

238
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,120
Hi.

239
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,760
Oh, hello, Nom Jued.

240
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:30,240
Hi, Phra Rong!

241
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:32,560
Why are you here?

242
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:39,160
Oh, you wanna chill out in our room, too?

243
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:40,640
That's right.

244
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:45,080
I wanna chill out here for a little bit.

245
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:48,890
What?

246
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:53,240
Phra Aek, why are you still making that face?

247
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,880
You still have a headache?

248
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,200
It's nothing.

249
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:03,560
Here.

250
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:05,800
Mom got this for you.

251
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,400
You went back home to see our parents?

252
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:13,680
Mm.

253
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:17,560
Thank you.

254
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:24,040
Don't you wanna visit them, too?

255
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,440
They're missing you.

256
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,600
Right. I'll think about it.

257
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:33,120
Suit yourself.

258
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:46,720
Whatever.

259
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,680
Get out.

260
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:59,160
I've gotta go now.

261
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:02,000
What? You're leaving already?

262
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:04,040
That's right.

263
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,240
I'll come and play with you guys again.

264
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:07,880
Play what?

265
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,760
Just head home already.

266
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:11,680
- Phra Aek!
- Whatever.

267
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:13,800
Be kind to your brother.

268
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:16,040
Walk him downstairs, too.

269
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:17,840
Fine.

270
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:21,480
Come with me.

271
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:22,320
Go!

272
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,560
Okay.

273
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:24,640
Go!

274
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:26,640
You're not playing with me at all.

275
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:27,960
Just leave already.

276
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:30,640
- Just hurry up and leave already.
- I know!

277
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,760
Leave already.

278
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:36,840
Hold up.

279
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:39,640
What's going on with you two?

280
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:41,640
Come on.

281
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,440
You're committed?

282
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:46,680
Mm.

283
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,040
Okay.

284
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:53,760
Good luck.

285
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:58,400
- See you.
- Thanks.

286
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:14,960
Nom Jued.

287
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:17,500
Let's go and see my dad.

288
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:26,800
- What about your umbrella?
- Got it.

289
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:29,560
- A mosquito repellent?
- I already got it.

290
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:31,800
Don't forget your water bottle, too.

291
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:33,360
Already taken care of, Mom.

292
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,880
Don't worry, Mom.

293
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:37,960
Hello.

294
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:39,640
Hello, Phra Aek.

295
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:41,000
You look handsome today.

296
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:45,160
If you get tired,
stop at a gas station, okay?

297
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,320
Have a safe road trip.

298
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:47,550
Understood, Mom.

299
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:49,720
Don't worry, Mom.

300
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,080
If he gets sleepy,

301
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:53,320
I'll pinch him awake.

302
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:57,120
Safety guaranteed.

303
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:58,480
No worries!

304
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:00,080
Excellent, dear.

305
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:04,970
- I've gotta go now.
- Right.

306
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,800
Have a safe trip, okay?

307
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:08,760
Thank you.

308
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:09,760
Enjoy your trip.

309
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:11,040
Thank you. Here.

310
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:12,720
Right this way!

311
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,570
Bye!

312
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:18,400
Have a safe trip, boys.

313
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:45,320
Phra Aek!

314
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,320
Phra Aek! Phra Aek!!

315
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,920
- Phra Aek!
- Turn around! I'm right here.

316
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,920
That buffalo looks so adorable.

317
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:58,360
Right.

318
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,440
Whoa...

319
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:06,200
Your house looks amazing.

320
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:10,480
- Oh, you're here already?
- Hi, Mom.

321
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,760
This is Nom Jued.

322
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:14,520
- Oh...
- Hello.

323
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:15,560
No need for such formality.

324
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,320
Let's get inside, shall we?

325
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:18,560
This way.

326
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,000
Phra Aek, unload your belongings.

327
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:22,800
On my way.

328
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:24,200
Come with me.

329
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,400
Right. Thank you.

330
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:27,880
This way, dear.

331
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:30,080
Have a seat here.

332
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:31,880
- Get yourself rested up first.
- Thank you.

333
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,440
Make yourself at home, okay?
I'll be right back.

334
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:56,760
How was the long drive home?
Are you tired?

335
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:58,640
A little bit.

336
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:01,480
Are you good?

337
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:07,320
Here, have a drink.

338
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:09,080
- Please, enjoy.
- Thank you, Mom.

339
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:11,120
Mom, where's Dad?

340
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:12,560
Is he in a meeting?

341
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:14,480
Yes, it's a residential meeting.

342
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:15,720
I see.

343
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:22,880
Let's go. I'll show you around.

344
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:23,640
Mm.

345
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:29,480
Come on! Why are you drinking
from this little boy's glass?!

346
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,880
Why didn't you get yourself one?

347
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:34,800
What little boy?

348
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:37,560
He's older than me.

349
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:39,200
Really?

350
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:41,880
How old are you?
What year are you studying?

351
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,040
I'm a junior student,

352
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:46,920
and I'm turning 22 this year.

353
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,520
Whoa...

354
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,080
You're old.

355
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:56,800
Do you know that you're old?

356
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:04,840
This is my bedroom.

357
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:17,720
I'm allowed to enter it, right?

358
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:19,960
Please come in.

359
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,640
I really love this place.

360
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:40,200
Come and stay with me.

361
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:43,280
I'm always with you, wherever you are.

362
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:47,920
I'm thirsty.

363
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:49,600
Hm?

364
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:40,560
Phra Aek.

365
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:42,280
Your stubble tickles me.

366
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:46,680
- Ow!
- Whoa!

367
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:49,800
Why did you bite my neck?

368
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:51,480
It was just a tease.

369
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:53,720
That hurt.

370
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:57,640
A smooch should fix that.

371
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:02,800
Huh?

372
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:16,200
Come on! Phra Aek!

373
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:19,880
Hey!

374
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,600
That's a shame.

375
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,440
What's this heavenly smell?

376
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:50,240
Please wait. It'll be ready soon.

377
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:53,520
Let me call Phra Aek to have this first.

378
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:54,960
Sure, go ahead.

379
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:58,200
Oh, you're up already?

380
00:28:58,400 --> 00:28:59,640
Why are you messing about here?

381
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:02,880
I'm not messing around.

382
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:05,960
I just wanna help Mom
with banana in coconut milk.

383
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:08,600
Why are you being so harsh on him, hm?

384
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:12,880
Oh, my Little Pup!

385
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:15,280
- You're home?
- Dad!

386
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:17,120
You're so loud!

387
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:20,520
I'm happy that you're not lost
on the way home!

388
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:23,200
Why would I be lost?

389
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:24,640
This place has my scent all over.

390
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:25,590
Come on!

391
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:28,480
Hello.

392
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:30,080
Who's this?

393
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,100
This is Nom Jued.

394
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:35,560
He's my lover.

395
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:38,260
Your lover?

396
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:41,280
Are you...

397
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:42,800
Uh...

398
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:45,840
Phra Aek might be a little bit dazed.

399
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,240
How did you two meet?

400
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:53,920
He got me a cup of coffee at my faculty.

401
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:56,680
Then... we hit it off.

402
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:57,640
End of story.

403
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:01,840
Be more polite, Phra Aek.

404
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:05,040
You sure you didn't abduct him?

405
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:07,440
Hey, Little Boy, don't be scared, okay?

406
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,400
Be honest. Did you come here willingly?

407
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:14,560
- Uh...
- See?!

408
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:16,680
He's here unwillingly, right?

409
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:20,280
Jued, tell him.

410
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:22,680
Uh...

411
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:25,920
I came here by my own will.

412
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:31,200
Did you?

413
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:33,600
Are you sure?

414
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,240
Alright then!

415
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,400
What a sweet fella.

416
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:45,280
I like you.

417
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:47,800
You're not mad at me?

418
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,200
At what?

419
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:51,800
You didn't do anything wrong.

420
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:54,360
Right.

421
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:58,200
Why would he be mad at us
if we haven't done anything wrong?

422
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:00,440
That's right.

423
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:03,800
But both of us are...

424
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:06,640
A couple?

425
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:09,200
Come on. About that...

426
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:10,770
I'm okay with that, I guess.

427
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:12,200
I was just a little shocked,

428
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:14,640
but I'm a progressive person, you know?

429
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:16,720
I'm cool with you guys.
Isn't that right, honey?

430
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:17,600
Yeah.

431
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,240
Whoa...

432
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:22,840
You're so cool, Dad.

433
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,840
Come on! I've always been this way.

434
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:26,080
Or else I wouldn't have her as my wife.

435
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:27,520
Whoa!

436
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,720
You're especially cool, that is.

437
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,040
Thank you, Dad.

438
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:35,000
It's your mom whom you need to thank.

439
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:37,530
I love you, Mom!

440
00:31:37,570 --> 00:31:38,560
Please let me hug you.

441
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:40,320
Oh, I'm all messy from cooking.

442
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:41,800
Hold off on the hugs for now.

443
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:53,200
What's wrong?

444
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:00,880
You don't wanna take me
to see your parents at all?

445
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:06,520
Phra Aek and Nom Jued are seeing them.

446
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:09,560
Let's go and see them when we can, okay?

447
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:14,400
You don't want them to see me.

448
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:15,760
Isn't that right? I knew it.

449
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:18,200
Of course, I want them to meet you.

450
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:19,960
Why wouldn't I want that?

451
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:23,480
I'm having an exam, you see.

452
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:26,040
Let's go and see them when we're free, okay?

453
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:30,240
I don't care.

454
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:31,560
I'm done talking to you.

455
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:46,320
Here.

456
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:01,480
Are you no longer mad at me?

457
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:03,600
No!

458
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,520
Please forgive me.

459
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:11,920
Please forgive me! Please!

460
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:13,720
Please?

461
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Have you forgiven me?

462
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:19,090
No.

463
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:22,680
- Please stop being mad at me.
- Never.

464
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:23,640
Please, please, please.

465
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:24,760
Hey, Pai!

466
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:26,520
You're here as well?!

467
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:29,520
Hey!

468
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:33,290
Tell me where your brother took Nom Jued to.

469
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:34,880
Oh, Rong.

470
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:36,360
What's wrong with you?

471
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:39,640
He turned off his phone.

472
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:41,320
So I couldn't find him.

473
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:43,960
So it's gotta be you now.

474
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:46,360
Tell me where your brother is hiding.

475
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:50,120
They're on a date.

476
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:53,120
What do you want me to do?

477
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:55,320
I don't know.

478
00:33:57,320 --> 00:33:58,800
Just tell me

479
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:02,000
- where Phra Aek has taken Nom Jued.
- Yeah.

480
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:40,800
Nom Jued!

481
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:42,719
Wanna try riding a buffalo?

482
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:48,320
Come and try it!

483
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:49,840
Wanna try it?

484
00:34:56,340 --> 00:34:57,460
It seems like you've never ridden one.

485
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:58,600
- Yes.
- Would you like to try?

486
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:00,960
- Yes, I'd love to.
- Let me give it a go!

487
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:12,520
Huh?!

488
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:15,280
Jued! Where did you go?

489
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:21,800
Be careful, Nom Jued.

490
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:26,080
Man is really lovely, Dad.

491
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:28,520
Don't get me started.

492
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:31,320
He's the buffalo we've had the longest.

493
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:34,160
No matter how many times I sold him,
he always longs for our home.

494
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:36,080
So I always had to spend my money
buying him back.

495
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:37,320
Come on, this way.

496
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:38,400
Move, son!

497
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:41,440
I think he really loves you.

498
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:43,560
Of course!

499
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:44,960
Right this way.

500
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:46,080
Quickly!

501
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:47,320
Show him what you're made of.

502
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,000
What are you guys talking about?

503
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:49,960
Oh.

504
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,400
It's great that you're here.

505
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:54,720
Take care of your partner and Man, okay?

506
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:57,640
I haven't watered the crops back at the farm.

507
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,640
Sure, I'll take it from here.

508
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:02,280
- See you.
- Yes, thank you!

509
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:18,410
This place is so much prettier

510
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:21,440
and more pleasant
than what I saw in your photos.

511
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:24,680
Yes.

512
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:32,560
I can't believe that
your place is actually this massive.

513
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:34,160
Mm.

514
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:38,920
What does your dad do?

515
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:42,680
He grows produce for a living,

516
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,570
and his lands have been passed down
for generations.

517
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:48,040
Still, there have been some rough times.

518
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,560
That was when we had to sell some of them.

519
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:54,520
Fortunately, Phra Rong saved us.

520
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:55,840
So we didn't get scammed.

521
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:58,880
Really? Phra Rong?

522
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:00,640
Mm.

523
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,480
And is that him, Phra Aek?

524
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:08,320
Wait, it's him!

525
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:10,120
How did he get here?

526
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:15,360
Phra Aek!

527
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,360
Why did you take Nom Jued here?

528
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:19,960
Nom, get off the buffalo.

529
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:22,320
It's okay, Phrab.

530
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:23,560
I wanna ride it myself.

531
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,840
This is Man.

532
00:37:25,870 --> 00:37:27,200
Isn't he adorable?

533
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:29,400
Is it gonna ram into me?

534
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:31,320
Yeah, go for it, Man!

535
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:33,220
Don't get ahead of yourself, Phra Aek.

536
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:37,280
You killed the mood, Phra Rong.

537
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,040
Right.

538
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:42,520
I'm gonna drop off my stuff then.

539
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,680
I'm so damn tired from driving here.

540
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:46,000
See you.

541
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:48,240
Why are you hiding behind me?!

542
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:50,680
Go!

543
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:55,800
What the hell are they doing?

544
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:09,800
Help me get everything on the grill.

545
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:17,440
What's wrong, Nom?

546
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:20,800
I don't know.

547
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:22,320
I think I'm kinda gassy.

548
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:26,400
Maybe you had too much food
that my mom made.

549
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:28,280
Probably.

550
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:31,720
That's okay, though. I got this.

551
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:33,520
Ta-da!

552
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:36,560
It's so easy to take.

553
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:38,320
Simply tear the sachet open

554
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:40,600
and consume it.

555
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:44,600
Whoa!

556
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:45,960
Whoa...

557
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:49,920
And it's...

558
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:51,960
It's a probiotic supplement.

559
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:53,520
Oh.

560
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:55,560
My mom got some for your parents, too.

561
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:56,720
Oh, really?

562
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:57,720
Here.

563
00:38:58,200 --> 00:38:59,280
Have a whole box.

564
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:00,720
She still got plenty of this back home.

565
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:02,720
Thanks.

566
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:08,880
Hey!

567
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:11,800
Get the other piece!

568
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:13,160
I grilled it myself.

569
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:15,280
- Hey, it was me!
- It's mine!

570
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:17,200
- Hey!
- Stop it you two.

571
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:18,440
There are other pieces to get.

572
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:21,120
Here, Phrab, you can have this piece.

573
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:25,080
Pai, what are you doing?

574
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:27,040
I'm getting Phra Rong some vegetables.

575
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:29,920
It clearly was pork.

576
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:33,560
You two are acting so suspicious right now.

577
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:38,120
Suspicious of what?

578
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:42,200
Where are Phrab and Pai gonna stay, though?

579
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:44,560
Well...

580
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:46,480
Pai can share the room with Phra Rong.

581
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:48,240
Three of you can snuggly share the room.

582
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:52,280
Whoa, that's nice!
Three of you get to be in the same room!

583
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,800
- It must be so comfy.
- No!

584
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:54,560
No.

585
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:57,370
Why are you guys whispering?

586
00:39:58,520 --> 00:39:59,360
What whispering?

587
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:02,120
I just...

588
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:04,240
We wanna share the room.

589
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:05,200
It's comfy.

590
00:40:06,010 --> 00:40:07,010
Yeah.

591
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:10,520
Fine. I'll sleep outside.

592
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:14,920
God! Karma's a bitch!

593
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:17,440
I shouldn't have said it,

594
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:19,440
so I'm now stuck here.

595
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:45,200
I know that you're secretly dating Rong.

596
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:48,480
Seeing you two always being together
isn't a coincidence!

597
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:52,000
You two being together
won't matter anyway

598
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:56,440
because Pai got a job in Korat!

599
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:00,400
Will we get to sleep?

600
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:07,560
He'll eventually fall asleep.

601
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:09,720
Let's hit the hay.

602
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:13,880
About you working in Korat...

603
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:15,640
What is it?

604
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:22,480
Well...

605
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:27,960
Before knowing you,
I always wanted to work in particle physics.

606
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:33,160
In Korat, there's a research facility,

607
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:35,680
so I wanna work there.

608
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:44,960
You didn't wanna tell me about it at all?

609
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:58,000
Since I met you,

610
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:00,600
my goal has changed.

611
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:03,040
Back then,

612
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:06,440
I just wanna keep my distance
from my parents.

613
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:11,200
Now, I don’t even know if that’s still my goal.

614
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:18,080
It's okay.

615
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:20,360
Take your time.

616
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:24,080
Are you actually okay

617
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:27,160
that I'm moving to a different region?

618
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:30,800
Mm.

619
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:32,640
Of course.

620
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:34,240
I can drive there to see you.

621
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:36,960
With your motorbike?

622
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:38,520
Are you crazy?

623
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:40,300
With a car, of course.

624
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:43,160
A motorbike?

625
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:44,480
Are you kidding me?

626
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:47,240
I only see you get around by riding one.

627
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:50,610
That wouldn't cut it.

628
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:44,640
Gotcha!

629
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:46,640
I know what you're doing.

630
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:48,600
Screw this.

631
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:52,040
I'm gonna sleep by myself.

632
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:09,240
God.

633
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:20,040
Mm...

634
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:24,720
You've brought Nom to see your family?

635
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:26,720
That's right.

636
00:44:28,360 --> 00:44:29,360
You're introducing him to them?

637
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:34,000
To pay respects to the future parents-in-law.

638
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:43,120
That means you two have already

639
00:44:44,060 --> 00:44:46,480
done

640
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:47,440
the thing, right?

641
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:50,840
What are you talking about?

642
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:53,120
I mean...

643
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:56,120
- You've conquered him, right?
- Shut it!

644
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:58,600
Quit being so nosy.

645
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:01,160
I had good intentions!

646
00:45:01,700 --> 00:45:03,520
But trust me...

647
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:08,400
He's very new to this whole thing.

648
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:09,680
God.

649
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:15,840
Fine.

650
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:20,280
I'll let you in on a secret.

651
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:23,280
I, Master Somchat, will show you the ropes.

652
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:24,120
May I?

653
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:26,360
Why? You're a pro at this?

654
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:31,200
Don't take my years of experience lightly!

655
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:34,520
So you're telling me that
you've done it multiple times?

656
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:37,480
I'm so experienced that
I could publish a book about it.

657
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:39,080
- With women?
- With porn!

658
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:42,040
Not like this again.

659
00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:42,990
My response to jokes is swift.

660
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:45,920
Well, I actually am experienced.

661
00:45:46,120 --> 00:45:47,680
You're giving me a headache.

662
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:50,360
Hey, Phra Aek.

663
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:53,000
Here.

664
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:55,400
This is the stuff.

665
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:57,000
The Peak Performance Punch!

666
00:45:57,040 --> 00:45:58,960
It keeps you going for three nights straight.

667
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:02,360
What does it do?

668
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:04,720
It peaks...

669
00:46:05,080 --> 00:46:06,080
It peaks like...

670
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:12,360
Oh?

671
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:14,280
Nom.

672
00:46:14,820 --> 00:46:16,360
Did I keep you waiting?

673
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:19,080
Not at all! I just got here, actually.

674
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:21,600
No, that's my line!

675
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:23,000
I was just kidding.

676
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:25,720
I was supposed to ask you that question.

677
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:28,280
You're getting funnier day by day.

678
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:31,920
Why did you want to see me, though?

679
00:46:32,840 --> 00:46:33,650
Well...

680
00:46:39,080 --> 00:46:40,360
I have something to ask you.

681
00:46:43,120 --> 00:46:46,200
Have you and Phra Aek ever

682
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:50,760
done it?

683
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,920
Oh!

684
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:58,040
You mean watching the film
'E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial' together?

685
00:46:58,360 --> 00:47:00,800
Of course, we've watched it
multiple times already.

686
00:47:01,720 --> 00:47:03,400
No! I mean...

687
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:05,740
Here's the thing.

688
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:08,840
Have you and Phra Aek

689
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:10,440
banged each other?

690
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:13,400
What does it mean?

691
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:16,280
Well...

692
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:21,160
I'm worried about you guys.

693
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:27,280
Lately, he's been holding it in.

694
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:31,520
He's really, really thirsty, you know.

695
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:35,210
- Is he?
- Correct!

696
00:47:36,560 --> 00:47:38,920
What should I do?!

697
00:47:39,120 --> 00:47:40,680
Can you give me a piece of advice, Somchat?

698
00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:43,170
Is there a way I can help him?

699
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:46,360
Don't worry, Nom.

700
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:47,880
You've asked the right person.

701
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:49,920
You can trust me.

702
00:47:55,160 --> 00:47:56,680
Here it is!

703
00:47:58,240 --> 00:47:59,040
No!

704
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:02,560
Don't open the box right now.

705
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:03,800
It's too out in the open!

706
00:48:04,700 --> 00:48:07,840
You must open it when you're alone!

707
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:09,440
Understood?

708
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:11,000
What if it's something bad?

709
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:13,880
It's me, remember?
I'm Somchat!

710
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:15,320
Trust me!

711
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:17,680
I only provide you with good stuff.

712
00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:21,480
- Okay.
- Okay?

713
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:24,600
- Handle it with care, okay?
- Sure.

714
00:48:25,100 --> 00:48:27,600
- I'll open it when I'm back at the place, okay?
- Mm!

715
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:29,880
You can count on me.

716
00:48:45,240 --> 00:48:46,240
All done.

717
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:50,320
- Thank you, Somchat.
- Mm!

718
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:52,040
I'll never forget your generosity.

719
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:54,320
Don't take it as generosity.

720
00:48:55,240 --> 00:48:57,800
By the way, are you done with your dish?

721
00:48:58,320 --> 00:48:59,560
Oh, you want it?

722
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:02,000
- I'm hungry. I've been working hard.
- Here.

723
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:03,360
You can have it, I guess.

724
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:04,640
- Allow me to have this.
- Okay.

725
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:18,320
Nom Jued! The meal is ready!

726
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:22,200
I'm coming!

727
00:49:26,320 --> 00:49:27,320
What are you...

728
00:49:36,080 --> 00:49:37,600
How do I look, Phra Aek?

729
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:41,320
Somchat told me that

730
00:49:41,560 --> 00:49:43,760
lately, you've been very thirsty

731
00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:45,160
and that you've been holding it all in.

732
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:47,000
So he gave me this outfit.

733
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:53,040
He also told me
that this will quench your thirst.

734
00:49:55,480 --> 00:49:56,640
What's wrong, Phra Aek?

735
00:49:57,040 --> 00:49:57,930
Are you in shock?

736
00:50:13,960 --> 00:50:14,960
I'm thirsty.

737
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:19,260
Mm.

738
00:51:16,680 --> 00:51:18,600
Alright, let's take a selfie.

739

that you're serious about us, no?
