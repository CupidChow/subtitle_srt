I'll forgive you for calling the guard on me.

15

00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,350
Oh, this is quite a lot, actually.

Sheesh.

18
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:01,250
It's not enough, though.

19
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:09,560
I spent all of their savings
on building a house, remember?

20
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,420
I don't even have a single dime left.

21
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:14,050
The house still isn't finished,

22
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:16,800
yet you also have to pay for
your worker medical bills on top of that.

23
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:18,600

Pong fell over in the middle of the field.

26
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:25,490
It's a miracle that
he didn't get hit by lightning after that.

27
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:28,400
Medical bills cost a fortune, though, Mom.

28

00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
- 20,000 baht.
- God, that's nothing.

37
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,780
I'll sell the buffalo for that money.

38

39
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:54,870

We'll get the money back
by selling land deeds in no time.

After selling this plot of land,

55

I'll use the money
to pay off whatever there's left.

Hey, Phra Aek.

62
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:21,209
I think I'm going to assign you this project.

63
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:25,600
With your previous projects,
which are about the countryside,

64
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,140

But...

68
00:04:35,159 --> 00:04:36,780
This is a global project!

69
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:40,570

70
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,810
Of course.

71
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:45,340
No pressure, by the way.

72
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:48,950
However, I want you to win us at least an award.

73
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:55,780
At any rate, consider signing up
at the end of this semester.

74
00:04:56,990 --> 00:04:58,990
If you won nothing, at least,

75
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,320
you got to compete in the big league.

76
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:03,520
Sure, Professor.

77
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:06,960
I'll propose new ideas to you
if one comes to mind.

78
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,040
I'm sorry.

79
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:26,970
Please, say something, Phra Aek.

80
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:29,730
Why?

81
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:32,380
Will saying something fix my camera?

82
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:33,800
Phra Aek...

83
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:37,140
I already told you to take care of it.

84
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:39,409
With its condition being this bad,
I suggest you get a new one.

85
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,159
Why?

86
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,440
The LCD screen came apart, the lens is cracked,

87
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,980
the shutter mechanism's dead,

88
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:48,480
and, as far as I've diagnosed,
the circuit board is also fried.

89
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,460
Both the sensor
and the shutter mechanism are dead.

90
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,240
This is basically beyond repair.

91
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,710
It only got dropped on the ground, though.

92
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,740
Your camera's pretty old, too, it seems.

93
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,620
You really can't repair it?

94
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,480
It's irreparable with this condition.

95
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:03,520
However, I'll call and ask another repair shop
and see what they can do.

96
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:05,140
I don't know if they're up for it, though.

97
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,870
But you're the best
repair technician around here.

98
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:09,600
Please repair it for me.

99
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,150
Kiddo, I just told you that it's irreparable.

100
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:14,760
It's best to move on from now.

101
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,210
It's okay, though, Phra Aek.

102
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:32,050
You might still have hope
at the next camera repair shop.

103
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:33,260
There's none left.

104
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,060
I've visited all the repair shops.

105
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,550
I'm sorry.

106
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:39,820
Stop saying sorry.

107
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:41,560
Sorry won't fix anything.

108
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,390
I have a big project to work on, too.

109
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:45,650
Fuck.

110
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,270
I've made my decision.

111
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:51,070
I'll find a way to compensate you.

112
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,590
Are you crazy, Nom?

113
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,070
It doesn't cost just a baht or two.

114
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,250
Huh? What do you want me to do then?

115
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,030
Alright. Pay me 150,000 baht.

116
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:05,140
Huh? 150,000 baht?!

117
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,140
Yeah.

118
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:10,960
How about we visit a few more
camera repair shops instead?

119
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,150
It's too late. Give me your phone.

120
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,610
Your phone! Quickly!

121
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:22,840
Here.

122
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,160
Huh?

123
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,740
Just add my phone number already.

124
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,480
Do I have to tell you everything?

125
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,720
But we've already got
each other's LINE contact, no?

126
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,920
It's easier this way for me
to tell you to pay up.

127
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,640
I won't ditch.

128
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:40,540
Also, give me your IG, X, Facebook,
and all of your social media accounts.

129
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,810
This way, you won't
be able to ghost me when it's time.

130
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,210
I only use Facebook and LINE.

131
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:46,680
I rarely use IG.

132
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,400
Just give me everything that you use.

133
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:51,810
Here.

134
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:55,040
That's my Facebook and LINE contact.

135
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:57,890
Right.

136
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,460
You can go home now.

137
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:06,820
Hey!

138
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,640
What the hell are you doing?

139
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:12,960
You're scaring me.

140
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,810
In science, it says that

141
00:08:15,850 --> 00:08:19,160
physical contact stimulates oxytocin,

142
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:21,630
which causes the body to produce endorphins,

143
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:26,440
reducing muscle tension and stress.

144
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,680
I don't want you to stress out.

145
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,440
Good luck, Phra Aek.

146
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,080
Even though we can't find one that
would repair the camera today,

147
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:48,130
I'll also save up
to pay you back in the meantime.

148
00:08:52,830 --> 00:08:54,050
Just go home already.

149
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,710
I'm heading home, too.

150
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:00,450
- Leave!
- Off I go then.

151
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,500
What should I do?

152
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:11,400
My mom would definitely kill me
if she knew about this.

153
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:14,560
Why am I this unlucky?

154
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,570
Shit. How did I make it back to my room?

155
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,170
Fuck!

156
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:52,860
Over 20 missed calls?

157
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:56,870
Hello?

158
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:58,480
Why are you?

159
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,290
I didn't answer the phone at all.

160
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,650
Did you go out with Nom?

161
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,240
Shit. I didn't.

162
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:08,580
God. That's unfortunate.

163
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:11,390
Just hastily find Nom.

164
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,540
He could've gotten mugged or worse at this rate.

165
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,200
God...

166
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:20,710
Nom is by the college.

167
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,400
You're making me anxious for nothing, man.

168
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,360
Okay. Have a rest.

169
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:26,600
That's all.

170
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,220
Right, I'm heading back to bed now.

171
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:31,260
My head is in pain, and so is my body.

172
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,640
What the fuck?

173
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:43,170
Time to call my girl!

174
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,650
Hello, babe.

175
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,780
I'm waiting at the same old place.

176
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:49,960
- Huh?!
- Huh?!!

177
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,390
You broke a camera?

178
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,050
A camera for taking photos?

179
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:59,550
Why are you always in trouble, Nom Jued?

180
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:01,040
Wanna make some merits?

181
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,120
You're also in the wrong.

182
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:05,990
If you were there with Nom,

183
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:07,400
none of this would have happened.

184
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,940
Yeah. I'm sorry.

185
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:12,520
I even promised that I'd take care of you,

186
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,010
but I failed.

187
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,340
But you're in the wrong as well.

188
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,980
You simply disappeared.

189
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,360
Disappeared?

190
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:22,070
I told you I was busy.

191
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:23,740
Calm down, guys.

192
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:25,010
Don't fight.

193
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:27,180
I only ask you one thing:

194
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:29,280
do not tell my mom.

195
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:33,120
Or else, she'd spank me to death.

196
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:40,770
What's your next move?

197
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,430
How are you gonna repay him?

198
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,380
Should we work as tutors?

199
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:53,360
Hey...

200
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,330
How about you borrow my money?

201
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,690
I can lend you some from my mom.

202
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,120
How much do you need?

203
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:00,960
100,000 baht.

204
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:02,350
100,000 baht?

205
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,980
Let's become tutors then.

206
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:29,330
Whoa...

207
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:32,700
Why are there so many students
working as tutors?

208
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,670
How about we apply for TAs?

209
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:37,620
50 baht per hour?

210
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:40,960
Will working as TAs earn us 100,000 baht?

211
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:42,680
Right...

212
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:49,660
Should we get a part-time job at a cafe?

213
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,130
At a nearby cafe?

214
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:52,400
Are they still accepting more people?

215
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:53,980
I think the slots are all full.

216
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,010
Nom Mhee Cafe.

217
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,380
Nom Mhee Cafe?

218
00:12:58,920 --> 00:12:59,920
Sure.

219
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,270
But...

220
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,070
I'll join you guys later.

221
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,900
Again? Where are you going?

222
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:08,330
It's just somewhere close by.

223
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,230
- Why is this such a big deal to you, huh?
- See?

224
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,270
You always leave two of us behind.

225
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:15,940
It's okay.

226
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:18,980
There's no need for a fight.

227
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,740
I can go with Pai.

228
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:23,270
Let's pay my debt!

229
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:41,380
Hey...

230
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:43,760
Is this Singha's place?

231
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:47,990
I just ordered a cup of milk drink
a day ago, though.

232
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:54,530
Should we pick a different cafe?

233
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,600
I think it's a good choice.

234
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:00,840
- Shit!
- Whoa.

235
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:02,920
A ghost?

236
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:07,510
What do we do, Pai?

237
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:09,140
I don't know!

238
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,270
Hey.

239
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:51,490
Nom...

240
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:53,350
Did you hear that?

241
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,040
Is it...

242
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,240
Whoa!

243
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:06,680
What?

244
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,010
What's going on?

245
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,250
What should we do?

246
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:19,620
Here.

247
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:23,260
What happened?

248
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,210
Like I've said.

249
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:29,490
Lately, the place isn't doing well.

250
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:31,180
What's even worse is that...

251
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:32,620
Just look around.

252
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,440
New cafes are sprouting left, right, and center.

253
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:38,910
How can my place compete with them?

254
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:44,560
And... are there any positions available?

255
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:47,960
Yes, I'm still hiring.

256
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,470
- Can I apply for a position here?
- Can I as well?

257
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,210
Huh?

258
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:56,780
Here's my resume.

259
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:58,240
And here's mine.

260
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:03,730
You guys are studying Science?

261
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:04,930
That's correct.

262
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:07,450
- You're also a physics major?
- Yes.

263
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:08,980
Are you sure you're available for this?

264
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:12,700
I can guarantee that, as a fan of this place,

265
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:16,050
since this cafe was opened,
I've been a loyal customer,

266
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:18,640
and I'll do my best.

267
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:19,540
Right.

268
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,480
Give it a shot, okay?

269
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,860
I didn't directly study this field.

270
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:25,380
What did you study then?

271
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:29,990
Machine Tool Technology.

272
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:34,670
Go!

273
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,140
Alright. Give it a shot.

274
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:40,840
- Give it a try.
- Sure.

275
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:43,400
- Please help me with this place, okay?
- Thank you so much.

276
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:46,180
- That's nice. I think you have potential.
- Yeah.

277
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:48,160
Can I put it away?

278
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,920
Sure, go ahead. That's great.

279
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,860
- You're awesome.
- You dropped the file.

280
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:55,300
Let's do this, okay?

281
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,740
Does the costume have to be this cute?

282
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,030
Hey there.

283
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,670
Stop focusing on the costume.

284
00:17:08,119 --> 00:17:09,609
Here. Let me teach you.

285
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,440
- Pay close attention, okay?
- Okay.

286
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:12,740
- I'm showing you once, okay?
- Right.

287
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:13,990
Here, take a look.

288
00:17:14,359 --> 00:17:15,800
The first step.

289
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:18,740
Fill the whole cup like so.

290
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:23,500
After it's in the cup, see this?

291
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:25,680
The ingredients all come together.

292
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:27,089
See? They become one mixture.

293
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,380
That's the entire step.

294
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:30,820
It's now ready to serve!

295
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,730
- Yeah?
- Whoa!

296
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,400
How's that? Isn't it cool?

297
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,260
Now, it's you guys' turn.

298
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,180
Alright.

299
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,570
Each of us gets a cup.

300
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,670
- Add the ice first, right?
- Yes.

301
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:31,480
Let's post some photos.

302
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:40,570
- Whoa, this is so lovely.
- Hey, hey.

303
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:42,240
What did you make?

304
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:44,070
What?

305
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,330
Does it look bad?

306
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:47,760
Why are you still asking me questions?

307
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,560
How is it similar to what I showed you?

308
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:53,560
- But...
- No arguing.

309
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:57,460
Oh, goodness gracious.

310
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,690
You told me you're a fan of this place, no?

311
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:00,810
- Gosh...
- Yes...

312
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,920
Go get a new bottle of whipped cream, okay?

313
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,010
- Right.
- Do you know how much it costs?

314
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:05,490
Why are you still standing there?

315
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:12,760
Phra Aek.

316
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,990
Have you come up with
a project to submit to Professor?

317
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:18,500
Not yet.

318
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,860
I'm going to make
a photography project about the homeless.

319
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:22,960
It's more of a Western-style project.

320
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,700
Hey, that sounds good.

321
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:28,680
As for my project, it actually just hit me.

322
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:32,420
I wanna shoot like how paparazzi do.

323
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:33,480
How does that sound?

324
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:34,680
It's such a cool idea.

325
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,190
Paparazzi makes a ton of money.

326
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:38,700
But, I don't think it's up your alley.

327
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,280
I mean... It's trial and error.

328
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:44,560
Kornthep.

329
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:46,530
How many people applied for the club?

330
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:49,040
A handful of people.

331
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:52,420
Are there any students
from other faculties that applied?

332
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,160
None.

333
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:56,580
What about Science students?

334
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,150
There's none.

335
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:01,640
Why?

336
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,760
Hey, where are you going?

337
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:08,760
I'm looking for inspiration.

338
00:20:14,810 --> 00:20:16,150
So much for the inspiration.

339
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,130
Don't you have any, Kornthep?

340
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:20,450
Working on my project
is already too much for me.

341
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:22,950
Are you free tonight, though?

342
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,280
What's up?

343
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:29,000
Cracking some cold ones

344
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:30,240
and lifting up some cups.

345
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:31,850
Sure.

346
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,280
See you at the car.

347
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:35,710
The first one to leave pays for the drink.

348
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:37,600
I'm coming after you.

349
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,520
You only drink unsweetened milk.

350
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,660
Seriously,
do you even drink other kinds of drinks?

351
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:50,380
Of course, I do.

352
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:53,080
But unsweetened milk is my favorite.

353
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:55,950
By the way, you don't have a class to attend?

354
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:57,360
Nope.

355
00:20:57,990 --> 00:21:00,460
Whoa, that's nice.

356
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:02,980
My next class starts at 4 P.M.

357
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:04,620
So I'm currently free.

358
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:05,750
Mm.

359
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,050
Nom!

360
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:10,450
Oh, Phrab and Pai?

361
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:13,000
Nom.

362
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,600
- We thought you were gone.
- Yeah.

363
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:18,520
No, I just went to buy a carton of milk.

364
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:19,680
That's why I'm waiting here for you guys.

365
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:22,820
What?

366
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:28,680
Who the hell are you?

367
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:30,540
Why are you sitting here?

368
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:32,660
Oh, I forgot to introduce him to you guys.

369
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,280
This is Phra Aek.

370
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,160
He's a sophomore
studying at a faculty nearby.

371
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:39,390
He's the one who forgot his coffee,

372
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:43,130
- Phra Aek?
- and I got it for him from the convenience store.

373
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:46,660
Phra Aek, these two are my friends:

374
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,070
Pomphrab and Satrupai.

375
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:52,300
Nom, how did you know him?

376
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:53,800
Yeah.

377
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:55,780
How did you two become friends?

378
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:57,950
How come I didn't know anything about this?

379
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:01,180
Well, we met each other
at the Faculty of Fine and Applied Arts

380
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,390
when...

381
00:22:04,450 --> 00:22:05,680
his little guy

382
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:07,920
was dead.

383
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:10,230
- Huh? His little guy?
- Huh? Dead?

384
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:12,400
Then...

385
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:17,830
The shop said his little guy
was in a very rough condition.

386
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:21,670
So we had to leave him there.

387
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,780
He's into that little of a boy?

388
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,240
Scary.

389
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:31,290
By the way, did you bring your little guy today?

390
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:32,890
Mm.

391
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:34,720
Back at the faculty.

392
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:36,550
By the way...

393
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:39,130
You're not submitting your photos for the club?

394
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,470
Mm... Phra Aek.

395
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,950
I have no photos to submit.

396
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:46,850
What about the photos back at that shoot?

397
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,810
They're yours.

398
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:51,750
It'd be bad if I were to use them.

399
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:54,280
You can just shoot photos with your phone.

400
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,020
Oh, Phra Aek...

401
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,550
I only have a phone camera.

402
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:00,380
How can I fare against others?

403
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:02,260
Don't get my hopes up.

404
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,510
I'm not getting your hopes up.

405
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:07,760
I'll show you.

406
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:12,440
Okay!

407
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:19,420
Right.

408
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:21,120
Time to ride my little guy.

409
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:22,160
No, ride my motorcycle.

410
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:23,840
See? It's getting to me.

411
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:25,840
I'll pick you up tomorrow, okay?

412
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:28,560
- Later.
- Bye-bye.

413
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:32,200
Nom.

414
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:36,080
Do not talk to that bastard.

415
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:36,990
Get it?

416
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:39,960
Yeah. What would you do
if he did bad things to you?

417
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:52,340
Nom.

418
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,000
How are you doing, dear?

419
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:58,620
Are you meeting Pom and Pai today?

420
00:23:59,590 --> 00:24:00,590
Yes, Mom.

421
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,260
Where are you guys going?

422
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:05,400
We're going to...

423
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:11,990
Go...

424
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:13,800
Go...

425
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:14,830
- Nom?
- Go...

426
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:16,160
What's the matter, dear?

427
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,440
There are a lot of bugs here, Mom.

428
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:19,320
- Bugs?
- I think you should get inside.

429
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:20,490
Or else they'll bite you.

430
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,830
- Have a safe journey, dear.
- Okay, Mom.

431
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,480
I'll be back soon.

432
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:27,080
- Alright, dear!
- I'll get you your favorite desserts, too.

433
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,250
- Alright.
- I'll come home soon!

434
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:29,210
Alright!

435
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:35,440
Phra Aek, I told you to move.

436
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:37,360
Huh? I didn't know.

437
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:38,790
I thought you were telling me to come to you.

438
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:40,020
Let's get going.

439
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:44,410
Here.

440
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:48,000
- Quickly.
- Right.

441
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:49,040
Go, go, go!

442
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:51,400
Easy!

443
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:52,540
Quickly.

444
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:53,360
Ow.

445
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,760
Hurry, or else my mom will see us.

446
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:19,180
And...

447
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:21,250
What type of photography do you wanna do?

448
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:24,080
No idea.

449
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:27,610
Try and think like...

450
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,720
Is there anything
you'd like to convey through your photos?

451
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,530
A kitty cat!

452
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,000
Yeah, it's a cat.

453
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,290
Why?

454
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:49,600
What is a cat's perspective of us?

455
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:19,880
Hey, Phra Aek.

456
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,700
Is that a photo taken by your pupil?

457
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:23,880
Yes, of course.

458
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:27,140
Do you think he's gonna make it?

459
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:29,040
Just wait and see.

460
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:30,080
What's he shooting?

461
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:30,890
You'll see.

462
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:35,480
Hello.

463
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:39,760
I'm Nom Jued, a Science junior.

464
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:41,630
Well...

465
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:43,900
The photo I took

466
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:48,520
represented a stray cat's perspective

467
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:52,240
on its surroundings.

468
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:54,230
During the shoot,

469
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:59,400
I aimed to portray how a cat sees the world

470
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:01,380
and what it observes.

471
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:03,740
Then, I edited the photo
as if it was through the cat's eyes.

472
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:07,810
Excuse me, may I ask you a question?

473
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:09,100
- Yes?
- So...

474
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:11,430
Your photo...

475
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,250
What kind of camera did you use to take it?

476
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:15,260
I took it on a phone.

477
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:16,670
Oh, I see.

478
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:18,500
You shot it with your phone camera?

479
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:20,120
I thought...

480
00:27:21,310 --> 00:27:23,000
you shot it on an iron!

481
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:33,100
Is the use of a phone camera
not allowed in the club?

482
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:35,560
Any camera works, actually.

483
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:38,640
Your idea is an interesting one.

484
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:42,170
What's the key message of the photo?

485
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:44,010
The key message?

486
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,300
Can he answer it?

487
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:50,160
No clue.

488
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:57,700
Sometimes, I just want to show

489
00:27:58,230 --> 00:28:01,950
how lonely a cat can be

490
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,410
and its struggle to find food.

491
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:06,240
That's about it.

492
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:08,550
Mm. It's okay, actually.

493
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:09,970
That's pretty much it for me.

494
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:12,550
Next one, please.

495
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:31,970
How was it?

496
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:35,170
Thank you, Phra Aek,
for helping me get a photo for the submission.

497
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:36,330
Are you okay?

498
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:41,830
Those guys were just trash-talking.

499
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:43,200
Don't listen to them.

500
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:46,210
I was quite surprised, actually.

501
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:49,760
Was my photo that bad?

502
00:28:53,850 --> 00:28:55,500
My Professor once told me that

503
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,940
engagements help photos
become widely recognized.

504
00:28:58,750 --> 00:28:59,930
Thanks, Phra Aek.

505
00:29:02,470 --> 00:29:04,060
It's nice to see things from your perspective.

506
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:07,940
Anyhow, let's wait and see

507
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:09,520
if I can be approved.

508
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:17,740
Come here!

509
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:19,490
Together, with me.

510
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:35,570
Why are they all lying all over the place?

511
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:36,880
Yeah.

512
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:40,400
Why don't they just go back home and sleep?

513
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:43,120
- Shit!
- Whoa!

514
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:45,220
Here for the assignment?

515
00:29:46,350 --> 00:29:47,280
Go to the Professor's room.

516
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:51,770
Let's go.

517
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:53,990
This place isn't safe.

518
00:29:55,750 --> 00:29:56,940
I hope Nom makes it.

519
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:58,300
Nom...

520
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:00,430
Don't die just yet.

521
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:02,240
Shit!

522
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:09,640
Nom Jued, please take care of this order.

523
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:11,260
Sure thing, Pai.

524
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:13,020
Whoa.

525
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:15,300
It's like I'm playing that old video game.

526
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:17,430
Yeah, make it taste good, okay?

527
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:19,790
We'd get scolded if it tastes bad.

528
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:26,430
You're really gonna join the Photography Club?

529
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:27,280
Mm.

530
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:30,860
I'm still not that sure myself, though.

531
00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:34,010
How about joining the club of our faculty?

532
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:35,640
It's much more comfortable.

533
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,670
Club members are also not intimidating.

534
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:39,700
Our junior year is over soon.

535
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:43,520
I'm worried that I won't get to do
what I wanna do.

536
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:45,140
I get that, but...

537
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:47,980
You can just take a photography class later.

538
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:49,870
There are plenty of online classes, too.

539
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:53,350
You'd be better off using that time
to study electrics and quantum physics.

540
00:30:56,950 --> 00:30:57,640
Mm.

541
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:01,600
The order's done, Pai.

542
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:03,860
Let me serve the order real quick.

543
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:04,810
Okay.

544
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:16,280
- Hey.
- Hm?

545
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:17,580
Beauty answered my text.

546
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:18,900
So what?

547
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:21,580
You're gonna ask her out?

548
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:24,200
Are you crazy?

549
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:25,920
One step at a time, you know?

550
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:27,430
Gosh, you're so dumb.

551
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,230
Just don't let me catch you

552
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:30,460
What?

553
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:32,260
spending all of your time with your girl

554
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:33,950
and then study off my notes later.

555
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:37,170
Come on. That's not gonna happen.

556
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:39,250
I'm doing that anyway.

557
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:40,680
Jeez.

558
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:43,680
"Legally..."

559
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:45,640
Here's your cup of coffee, sir.

560
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:46,860
Just put it here.

561
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:49,560
Enjoy your coffee.

562
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:50,520
Thank you.

563
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:03,700
Excuse me.

564
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:07,010
Yes? Is there a problem, sir?

565
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:10,160
This isn't the signature Americano.

566
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:12,650
Can you please get a new cup for me?

567
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:14,970
I think...

568
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:17,300
I followed the recipe.

569
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:20,270
Is there anything you'd like to adjust?

570
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:26,120
A shot of espresso
per 120-150 ml of hot water.

571
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:28,740
That's the perfect amount.

572
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:30,930
I think this is too bitter.

573
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:32,350
I can't drink it.

574
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:33,760
Understood.

575
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:36,540
Please.

576
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:39,920
Is it that bad?

577
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:41,440
It's too bitter.

578
00:32:44,370 --> 00:32:45,820
Here you go, sir.

579
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,000
That should be it.

580
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:57,970
Hey!

581
00:32:58,320 --> 00:32:59,650
Don't spit it on my book.

582
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:01,400
You even added syrup?

583
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:03,630
That's not right.

584
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:06,550
Then...

585
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:08,410
What should I do, sir?

586
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:10,210
Milk is already sweet by itself.

587
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:14,620
Can you grind the coffee beans
just a little bit finer?

588
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,510
I'll try, sir.

589
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:19,060
If you're that good,
then make it yourself.

590
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,150
If you can manage it, enjoy it.

591
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:23,860
If not, dump it.

592
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:25,720
Pai...

593
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:28,120
It's not drinkable.

594
00:33:28,350 --> 00:33:29,650
Then pay up.

595
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:32,620
I'm not paying.

596
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:34,300
Your craft is below the standard

597
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:37,130
and I've told you several times.

598
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:39,160
I'm not paying.

599
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:41,500
- Pai! Easy.
- You wanna fight?

600
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:42,520
It's okay, Pai.

601
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:43,430
Calm down.

602
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:44,690
What the heck?

603
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,380
- Why do I have to pay?
- Hold this.

604
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:49,120
My apologies, sir.

605
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:51,010
I'll hastily make a new cup.

606
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,570
Pai, Pai...

607
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:54,880
Go back.

608
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:56,000
We can make a new one.

609
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:56,960
Calm down.

610
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:58,590
It's okay.

611
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:01,240
I just wanna have a cup of coffee.

612
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:05,470
- Mm!
- Ouch!

613
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:08,560
What dog just slapped me on the head?

614
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:09,940
Dog?

615
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:11,690
It's me, Phra Aek.

616
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:13,639
And why are you going through my laptop?

617
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:14,780
Also, you stole my seat.

618
00:34:15,510 --> 00:34:16,630
You marked it with your pee or what?

619
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:19,469
I smelled nothing,

620
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:21,469
yet you said this seat was yours.

621
00:34:21,639 --> 00:34:22,400
God.

622
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:25,120
Hey, Aek.

623
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:26,909
Who's this?

624
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:30,500
A spoiled pup.

625
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:32,530
He's the subject of your project?

626
00:34:33,380 --> 00:34:34,699
Why are you taking portraits, though?

627
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:37,130
It's nothing, really.

628
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:38,960
I just wanna experiment.

629
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:42,310
What...

630
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:43,790
Hold on...

631
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:46,639
He's...

632
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:49,639
This kid...

633
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:53,429
He's that tiny boy
who asked to join the club, right?

634
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:55,120
Nosy!

635
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:57,410
Right in my fucking face.

636
00:34:57,860 --> 00:34:59,510
It's my work!

637
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:02,780
Stop being nosy and continue with your work.

638
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:03,990
Sure!

639
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:05,840
It's mine now.

640
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:08,730
- Hey, that's my laptop!
- And I'm gonna use it.

641
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:10,840
- Just leave.
- You're such a...

642
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:11,770
Off you go.

643
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:17,400
Hey...

644
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:18,920
I'll be right back.

645
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:21,300
Here we go again.

646
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:23,090
You're leaving again?

647
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:27,090
A world record goes to you, my guy.

648
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:29,530
It hasn't been 5 minutes, and he left again.

649
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:30,640
I'm here working all by myself.

650
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:32,880
At this rate, we're gonna repeat this year.

651
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:36,000
Hey.

652
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:37,560
Hi, Phra Aek.

653
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:38,720
What are you doing here?

654
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:43,340
I think I'm gonna resign from the club.

655
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:46,480
What? But the amount of work
you've put into this...

656
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:50,300
Yeah, I only have a phone camera.

657
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:51,540
I don't have a professional camera.

658
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:54,050
Everything seems so hard to me.

659
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:56,150
Also...

660
00:35:57,220 --> 00:35:58,640
People here seem so talented.

661
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:00,880
How would I fare against them, Phra Aek?

662
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:04,040
Join the club and I'll cut down on the debt.

663
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:06,380
How exactly?

664
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:19,030
I'm giving you this one per day.

665
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:22,280
If you join the club,
a sticker represents 1,000 baht.

666
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:24,480
You can be at the club either for
half a day or a whole day.

667
00:36:26,610 --> 00:36:27,980
You sure it's a good idea?

668
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:30,790
Do you wanna finish paying off my debt ASAP?

669
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:34,460
Mm. I kinda do.

670
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:37,000
I no longer wanna have
a secret between my mom and me.

671
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:38,700
I've cut down the debt.

672
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:40,160
So join the club.

673
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:44,960
I'm off to my class then.

674
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:46,230
Right.

675
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:48,420
Wait.

676
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:51,080
Are you free this Saturday?

677
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:15,960
Where do I put the chair, Phra Aek?

678
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,270
Just put it there.

679
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:23,940
There.

680
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:29,760
It's exhausting.

681
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:32,360
Life isn't easy. It's hard to make a living.

682
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,910
People say we don't have a bright future.

683
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:35,450
We're at the bottom.

684
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:37,540
However, I know smithing.

685
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:38,980
Yet, nobody was willing to accept me.

686
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:41,220
I do have a house,

687
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:45,400
but I'm annoyed by the relatives arguing.

688
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:48,680
So I decided to leave myself.

689
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:50,610
When something was missing,
we were the ones to blame.

690
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:54,000
I just recently got beaten up
and received a death threat.

691
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:57,080
Don't look at it on a surface level.

692
00:37:57,560 --> 00:38:00,660
Just staying here like this is
enough for me to be happy.

693
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:02,280
I don't have to think about anything much.

694
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:09,520
Why are you smiling?

695
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,560
Well, I'm happy.

696
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:13,610
I got to see so many things.

697
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,540
I never thought I'd see that side of yours.

698
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:19,920
What are you gonna do with
the photos and the videos that you took?

699
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:22,680
They're for the upcoming photo exhibition.

700
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:24,540
Mm.

701
00:38:25,010 --> 00:38:26,550
I'll also give them the prints.

702
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:28,080
That's nice.

703
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,800
The world would be in a much better place

704
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:33,490
if people saw things
from different perspectives.

705
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:36,360
That's similar to how physics works.

706
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:39,160
Hm... You're all over the place.

707
00:38:40,060 --> 00:38:43,110
Phra Aek,
can I buy a bottle of water real quick?

708
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:44,640
Go ahead.

709
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:45,880
Oh.

710
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:50,660
Here.

711
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:52,050
It's on me.

712
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:53,770
You helped me with my work.

713
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:57,180
Are you sure, Phra Aek?

714
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,470
Just take it.

715
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:00,940
- I'll be right back, okay?
- Mm.

716
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:02,960
Hand me your stuff.

717
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:22,970
- Here! Isn't it sweet?
- Whoa.

718
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:25,760
Whoa! The money was for the drink!

719
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:27,040
Here it is.

720
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:29,320
I redeemed it.

721
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:31,660
And you told me
you're saving money to pay me back.

722
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:33,510
Aww...

723
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:37,450
It's just too sweet to pass.

724
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:42,190
I'll save up and repay you, okay?

725
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:44,210
Come on...

726
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:49,640
[Phra Aek: Are you home?]

727
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:50,760
[Phra Aek: Did you know the way back?]

728
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,420
[Nom Jued: I did, and I'm home now]

729
00:39:53,310 --> 00:39:56,240
[Phra Aek: That's good]
[Nom Jued: I'm tired; I'm heading to bed]

730
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:58,280
[Nom Jued: Today was so much fun; good night]

731
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:20,150
Scientific communication
should be clearer and more accurate

732
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:25,120
as the presented details
must be verifiable yet simple.

733
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:28,350
Hey, Nom.

734
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:30,300
Did you stop talking to that bastard?

735
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:32,080
Who?

736
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:34,440
The guy named Phra Ass or something.

737
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:38,570
His name is Phra Aek, not Phra Ass.

738
00:40:39,580 --> 00:40:40,580
It's all the same.

739
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:43,560
I just wanna say his name.
It pains me to say it.

740
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:45,860
Hey, guys.

741
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:50,160
Phra Aek is a very good guy.

742
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:53,350
Good or bad, I'm still not trusting him.

743
00:40:53,580 --> 00:40:55,140
Also, I don't like him.

744
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:56,400
Same.

745
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:58,010
So, stay away from him.

746
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:02,950
By the way, have you joined the club?

747
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:04,520
I have.

748
00:41:05,470 --> 00:41:07,260
Wait, why didn't I see your name?

749
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:10,080
I joined the Photography Club.

750
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:11,520
Seriously?

751
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:16,760
You're ditching two of us?

752
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:18,750
I'm sorry, Pai.

753
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:22,240
I just wanna do what I wanna do.

754
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:26,920
In all my life, I've never gotten to
follow my own dreams.

755
00:41:27,340 --> 00:41:29,330
I didn't say I was mad.

756
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:31,930
If you like doing something, then go for it.

757
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:33,670
That's great.

758
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:36,900
At least, I still got Phrab.

759
00:41:37,340 --> 00:41:38,230
Yeah.

760
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:43,170
I also didn't like the fact that
you forced me to join the same club as you.

761
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:47,680
That's why I ditched you
for the Robotics Club.

762
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:50,970
What? You're also ditching me?

763
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:53,510
Of course.

764
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:02,000
[Photography Club]

765
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:26,470
Jued.

766
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:29,350
Are you good, bro?

767
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:31,040
Why are you stumbling around?

768
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:33,660
Wait, you're not him.

769
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:34,980
Sorry.

770
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:50,960
Hi, Phra Aek.

771
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:51,850
Hm?

772
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:56,870
Have you been smoking?

773
00:42:57,160 --> 00:42:59,480
Yes, your class is over,

774
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:00,920
so go home.

775
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:02,610
I don't have time to play games with you.

776
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:04,410
You seem a little bit tired.

777
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:05,770
Have you slept?

778
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:07,450
I haven't.

779
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:09,560
I just submitted my project to my professor.

780
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:11,010
Are you hungry?

781
00:43:12,270 --> 00:43:13,370
Would you like to have anything?

782
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:14,450
No.

783
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,600
I'm having food back at my own place.

784
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:17,910
Just go home already.

785
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:19,750
I'll take you home.

786
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,920
You're gonna take me home?

787
00:43:22,940 --> 00:43:23,940
How?

788
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:25,480
By a tuktuk?

789
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,930
No, I'm calling a taxi.

790
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:29,720
By the way...

791
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:33,110
Where's your condo?

792
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:35,080
Listen.

793
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:37,020
If you visit my place,

794
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:39,970
I will...

795
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:00,560
It's just a hug,

796
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:02,240
why are you screaming over it?

797
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:03,270
Huh?

798
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:05,280
Who is he?

799
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:06,700
Is he yours?

800
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:09,870
Aww, since when did you
snatch yourself a boy?

801
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,740
That person's more important to you, huh?

802
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:13,160
What's wrong with you?

803
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:15,400
Can I say something?

804
00:44:17,080 --> 00:44:17,990
See...

805
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,760
It looks like you don't wanna
spend time with me, Beauty.

806
00:44:23,060 --> 00:44:24,720
It's not a one-way street, you know.

807
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:27,040
Here, Kornthep.
I brought you this flower bouquet.

808
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:28,960
Thank you.
