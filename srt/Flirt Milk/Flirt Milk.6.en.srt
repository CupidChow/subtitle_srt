00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:01,660
No. 2...

189
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,430
"In times of trouble or hardship,

190
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:07,670
help will come to guide you through."

191
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:13,000
"A lone soul may find a partner."

192
00:17:15,339 --> 00:17:17,740
"One must be patient and calm

193
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:22,079
to find love."

194
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:23,560
You're messing with me.

195
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,920
[In times of trouble or hardship,
help will come to guide you through...]

196
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:39,940
Sadhu.

197
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:43,080
If my partner does exist,
please appear right before me.

198
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:44,600
I've been waiting forever.

199
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,330
He's here.

200
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:50,070
What the hell?

201
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:52,630
You're asking for your partner.

202
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,600
That's why I said...

203
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,440
"He's here."

204
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:57,590
Fuck off.

205
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:05,130
They said that
if we get the same fortune stick number,

206
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:07,110
it means we're destined to be together.

207
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:10,730
Stop messing with me.

208
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:17,120
I'm not messing with you.

209
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:19,760
We just wanted to do the same thing.

210
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:22,580
I don't think that's the case.

211
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:25,120
Do you realize that
you're making me uncomfortable?

212
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:27,810
Yes.

213
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,520
I am sorry.

214
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:31,440
Well, then...

215
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:34,330
I'll stop making you feel that way.

216
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:37,130
That's great.

217
00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:45,360
Shit...

218
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:55,260
What's wrong with me?

219
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:00,200
Hey.

220
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:01,540
Huh?

221
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:02,960
I shouldn't have done that.

222
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,120
Why was I like that?

223
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:08,360
Easy, buddy.

224
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,120
Pull yourself together.

225
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,730
Don't hurt yourself, Jan.

226
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:28,970
What's wrong?

227
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,400
I tried.

228
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,470
Am I a bad person?

229
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:40,840
Answer me.

230
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,280
Listen.

231
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:47,360
About things you've done,

232
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,530
is it because you love her,

233
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:53,490
or is it because you want her to love you?

234
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:58,360
Answer me.

235
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:03,290
Of course, it's because I love her.

236
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,630
Then, no matter what she does to you,

237
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:16,080
whether it makes you happy or not,

238
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:20,190
you'll still love her, right?

239
00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:23,700
Mm.

240
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:30,000
When you love someone,

241
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:33,050
you wanna give it your all for them, right?

242
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:37,970
Of course.

243
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:48,600
It's okay.

244
00:20:51,930 --> 00:20:53,110
It'll be better.

245
00:20:54,130 --> 00:20:54,950
Okay?

246
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:58,210
Okay?

247
00:20:59,160 --> 00:20:59,960
Mm.

248
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:07,520
I'm so delighted,

249
00:21:07,670 --> 00:21:09,330
getting to shoot photos after the exam.

250
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:13,980
Are these photos great, Noey?

251
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:20,280
Can I be honest with you, Nom Jued?

252
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,200
Absolutely.

253
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:25,980
They look like photos for
high school art projects.

254
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:27,720
Whoa...

255
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:30,480
How should I fix that?

256
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:32,870
Um...

257
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:35,280
Hear me out.

258
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:38,670
What do you want your photos to be about?

259
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,650
The environment, right?

260
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:44,720
Mm...

261
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,270
I still can't figure it out.

262
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,340
How about you do that first?

263
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:55,080
Otherwise, we won't be able to convey

264
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,720
the message you want.

265
00:21:58,320 --> 00:21:59,620
This is so hard, Noey.

266
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:06,360
What emotion would you like the audience

267
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,520
to feel when they see the photos?

268
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:11,000
What emotion?

269
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:14,350
Mm...

270
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:32,430
You can leave without me, Noey.

271
00:22:32,470 --> 00:22:33,320
I can wait.

272
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:35,920
It's fine.

273
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:37,910
I can wait here with you.

274
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:40,500
Thanks, Noey.

275
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:45,240
You lent me your camera
and taught me photography.

276
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:49,360
Without you, I would've been in trouble.

277
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:52,590
Don't mention it.

278
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:54,580
Doing a photo shoot with you

279
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,490
has taught me a lot of things, too.

280
00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:00,380
If there's anything you need me for,

281
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,480
just tell me, okay?

282
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:03,560
I'm willing to help you with anything.

283
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:04,770
Really?

284
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,430
Mm. Yes.

285
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:08,880
Mm...

286
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:13,970
Can I ask you a question, then?

287
00:23:17,690 --> 00:23:18,440
Mm.

288
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:25,890
How do we let someone we like

289
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:29,200
know that we have a crush on them?

290
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:34,710
This is hard.

291
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:39,050
I would just tell them directly.

292
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:44,910
If not, I'll do everything
to let them know that I have a crush on them.

293
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:52,550
What if you knew that they didn't like you?

294
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:55,280
Have you already asked that person

295
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,490
to make you think like that?

296
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:01,840
Maybe it's just because

297
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:07,160
they don’t know yet.

298
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:12,940
If I were to say something to you,

299
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:16,180
could you keep it a secret?

300
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:18,120
Sure. What is it?

301
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,250
I have a crush on Phra Aek.

302
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:27,190
Oh...

303
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,140
Someone dropped more trash.

304
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:38,540
Thanks, Noey.

305
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:43,750
I will not tell anyone about it.

306
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,230
I promise.

307
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:47,120
Really?

308
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:49,670
Mm.

309
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:53,720
I will also help bring you
and Phra Aek together

310
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,050
in return.

311
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:12,110
Just pick up the phone first if you need to.

312
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:16,320
It's fine.

313
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,680
Let's continue with the shoot.

314
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:20,030
Let's go.

315
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:37,720
Alright, these are photos,
with the trash bin and garbage as the subject.

316
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:41,600
I shot them from the morning to noon, evening,

317
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,600
and the morning of the next day.

318
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:47,870
You can see that at each time of day,
piles of trash get bigger over time,

319
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:50,310
which is probably how it normally is.

320
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:54,160
Uh...

321
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:56,110
The concept...

322
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:57,320
The concept.

323
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,310
By studying these pictures,

324
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:07,000
it's clear that the garbage
we dispose of doesn't simply vanish.

325
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:10,660
It remains and keeps growing in size.

326
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:13,960
This issue needs to be resolved.

327
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,400
It's not limited to urban areas,

328
00:26:15,510 --> 00:26:19,830
but smaller communities
and even individual homes.

329
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:24,120
If we start with a small thing,
such as sorting the trash,

330
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:27,090
we might be able to reduce the waste.

331
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,360
Every neighborhood will become cleaner,

332
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:31,540
improving the environment.

333
00:26:40,230 --> 00:26:41,320
That's great.

334
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:42,280
It's phenomenal.

335
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:45,660
I didn't expect to see
this style of photos from you.

336
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:50,370
Focusing more on composition
and the trash bins

337
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:53,330
could highlight the concept even better.

338
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:54,480
Thank you.

339
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:56,350
I will apply it to my future projects.

340
00:26:57,320 --> 00:27:00,800
Lastly, a big thank you goes to Nong Noey.

341
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:06,640
He went to the shooting location with me
and gave me inspiration.

342
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:08,980
Good job.

343
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:11,720
Hey.

344
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:15,070
I think he's taking my place for the project.

345
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:16,520
How is he this talented?

346
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:19,760
You bet he's good.

347
00:27:19,930 --> 00:27:21,560
I trained him myself.

348
00:27:22,210 --> 00:27:22,990
Bah!

349
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:27,120
You always drag him around
to do your bidding.

350
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:28,560
Chat!

351
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,820
- You slapped me in front of the juniors?
- Yeah.

352
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:34,440
Ow, fuck...

353
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:36,880
Can I see it?

354
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,840
Whoa! Bro!

355
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:43,640
You might as well come and study
in this faculty

356
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:45,280
at this rate!

357
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:48,360
You're such a tease, Somchat.

358
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:51,300
This is the real deal.
You've got skills.

359
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:54,280
Can I take some photos as keepsakes?

360
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:56,030
- Sure, go ahead.
- Alright.

361
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:00,500
- Nong Noey.
- Yes, Korn?

362
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,630
You're friends with Nom Jued, right?

363
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:05,440
Oh.

364
00:28:05,670 --> 00:28:08,640
No, he's my senior.

365
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:11,250
Anyway, you're close to each other, right?

366
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:12,920
Oh...

367
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:15,210
I think we are.

368
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
So...

369
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:20,180
Can you do me a favor?

370
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:21,920
What favor?

371
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:24,210
Uh...

372
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:26,360
Can you help me win Nom Jued's heart?

373
00:28:26,550 --> 00:28:27,270
Huh?!

374
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:28,760
- Winning Nom Jued's heart?
- Shhh.

375
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:34,020
You know him.

376
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:37,380
So I think you know more about him
than I do.

377
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:39,760
I see...

378
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:42,720
I'll help.

379
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:44,700
I'll give it a shot.

380
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:45,600
Awesome.

381
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:47,120
Thank you very much.

382
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:48,410
- I've gotta go now.
- Bye-bye.

383
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:52,320
Can I be your pupil?

384
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,180
Thank you so much, Somchat.

385
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:57,670
These photos are sublime.

386
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:59,160
Would you like to see mine?

387
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:01,470
Please hold this for me.

388
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:04,600
Let me take some photos.

389
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:13,480
[Phra Aek, The Most Handsome Face]

390
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:15,200
Phra Aek.

391
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,140
Why are you calling me
if you're already next to me?

392
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:21,840
I'm just checking if you've set the picture.

393
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:23,480
I already have.

394
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:25,170
Here.

395
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:27,870
Great job, Jued.

396
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:35,780
Do you like my photos?

397
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:40,050
They're alright.

398
00:29:42,010 --> 00:29:46,210
What do I do to make you like them?

399
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:48,840
Invite me to a shoot next time.

400
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:52,030
If you came with me,

401
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:53,920
you'd end up taking all the photos yourself.

402
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:57,100
Just try to invite me first.

403
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:00,500
Who would know that you were free?

404
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:01,810
I thought you had an exam.

405
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:04,520
Just call me sometimes.

406
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:06,210
Mm.

407
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:09,360
I guess I'll do that from time to time.

408
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:19,840
Nom Jued.

409
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:22,510
Please ask Phra Aek
to give feedback on my work.

410
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:25,380
Oh, sure.

411
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:29,920
Phra Aek.

412
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:32,170
Please give a comment on Nong Noey's work.

413
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:36,900
Why do I have to do that?

414
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:40,210
Be gentle, okay?

415
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:44,120
Sure, I'll do it.

416
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:54,650
Huh...

417
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:57,480
Why...

418
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:00,610
Why do these photos look so familiar?

419
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,000
That's great.

420
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:14,790
It's conceptual art.

421
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:17,190
It's also easy to understand.

422
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,710
The fact that you like it is enough for me.

423
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:23,360
When I knew that
the theme of my assignment was time,

424
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:25,520
I was so lost.

425
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:27,280
After thinking about it,

426
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:30,770
I figured I should make a composite image.

427
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:34,100
That way, the message, "Life is short,

428
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:35,850
so do what you want to do,"
comes through stronger.

429
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:38,920
I don't know if you can feel it
from the photo, though.

430
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:46,610
Mm.

431
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:48,800
I do now.

432
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,800
I need to go to the bathroom.
I'll be right back.

433
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:54,580
Mm.

434
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:15,870
Here.

435
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:17,950
Have you been working all night?

436
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:19,440
You're ruining your health.

437
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:22,880
You're kidding me.

438
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:24,760
I'm still perfectly fine.

439
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:31,440
This is nice, though.

440
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:33,930
This way, no juniors
would approach me for comments.

441
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:36,660
You're such a bad senior.

442
00:32:37,090 --> 00:32:37,890
Huh?

443
00:32:38,780 --> 00:32:41,230
Do I actually have what it takes to
comment on their work?

444
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:43,640
Everyone's so passionate that...

445
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:45,700
I can't.

446
00:33:05,010 --> 00:33:08,730
With this...
What kind of relationship do you want?

447
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:12,920
'Cause...friends don’t do things like this.

448
00:33:16,190 --> 00:33:17,110
We can try.

449
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:21,550
Try what?

450
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:24,200
Try becoming a couple?

451
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:26,890
Yeah.

452
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:28,540
Life is short, you know?

453
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:32,740
It's that simple, see?

454
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:34,830
Why do you have to make it so complicated?

455
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:39,130
Of course, I have to!

456
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:41,200
We are friends.

457
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:44,550
One day, if we become more than just friends...

458
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:54,680
See this?

459
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:02,020
Have you ever seen me without this necklace?

460
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:05,470
I haven't.

461
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:08,520
Since you gave it to me,

462
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:10,639
I've never taken it off

463
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:13,900
and never will.

464
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:21,370
It's so pretty.

465
00:34:22,570 --> 00:34:24,210
- Thanks!
- Blow out the candles.

466
00:34:25,159 --> 00:34:26,000
I forgot that.

467
00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:34,239
- Yay!
- Okay!

468
00:34:34,510 --> 00:34:35,800
Happy birthday.

469
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:37,310
Wish you a ton of happiness,

470
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:38,730
my first friend.

471
00:34:39,239 --> 00:34:40,780
Sadhu.

472
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:45,070
By the way, why did you gift me the necklace?

473
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:47,290
It's got the letter 'B.'

474
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:48,840
I thought it would suit you well.

475
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:53,560
You know what?

476
00:34:55,239 --> 00:34:58,480
Even my partner forgot my birthday.

477
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:01,910
And my parents...

478
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:05,420
They don’t even get me a cake anymore.

479
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:07,990
It's okay.

480
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:10,360
They'll eventually get it.

481
00:35:11,540 --> 00:35:12,300
Okay?

482
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:14,790
In this day and age,

483
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:18,440
why can taking nude photos
lead to family estrangement?

484
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:21,440
If I were to do OnlyFans,

485
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:23,690
their hearts would probably
be broken to pieces.

486
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:26,140
Calm down.

487
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:28,600
Give them some time
to understand your decision.

488
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:31,090
Okay?

489
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:38,060
You won't leave me
because of this simple issue, right?

490
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:42,760
Mm! I will never leave your side.

491
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:43,800
I promise.

492
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:44,940
Here.

493
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:50,440
Promised.

494
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:57,370
Let's take things more seriously.

495
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:03,580
Sorry, I can't keep my eyes open.

496
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:08,890
You're gonna doze off right here?

497
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:10,980
Let's go somewhere else.

498
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:12,160
No.

499
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:36,680
Nom Jued.

500
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:37,960
Are you heading home already?

501
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:39,560
Yes.

502
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:41,360
I'm heading home.

503
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:44,200
You need to stay here
to wrap things up, right?

504
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:45,840
I can lend you a hand if you want.

505
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:47,280
It's fine.

506
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:48,700
You've done such a great job today.

507
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:50,920
Thanks.

508
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:55,500
Anyhow, I'd like to
keep learning from you, okay?

509
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:57,640
So...

510
00:36:58,160 --> 00:36:59,440
How are you going home?

511
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:00,520
Do you want me to give you a ride?

512
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:02,160
It's fine.

513
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:04,440
I'm heading back with my friends.

514
00:37:04,690 --> 00:37:05,690
Mm.

515
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:08,680
It's better if I give you a ride, though.

516
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:11,180
It's getting dark, too.
It can be dangerous.

517
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:15,200
Take it as a reward for impressing
the President of the Club.

518
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:19,240
Uh...

519
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:22,760
Can I change it from you giving me a ride

520
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:28,880
to you lending me a camera
for a shoot tomorrow at Nom Mhee Cafe?

521
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:31,960
For that, I've sorted it out for you.

522
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:34,280
I'll have it delivered to the cafe.

523
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:36,850
Thank you so much, Korn.

524
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:40,250
Umm... But...

525
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:42,880
If you're giving me a ride,

526
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:44,750
I'm cool with that.

527
00:37:45,860 --> 00:37:46,760
Really?

528
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:48,890
I'll come and pick you up, okay?

529
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,380
Okay.

530
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:58,350
Hello?

531
00:37:58,560 --> 00:37:59,520
Are you at the faculty?

532
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:00,840
Can you come to the club room?

533
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:02,520
I'd like to talk to you about the funding.

534
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:04,270
Yes, professor.

535
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:07,030
I'm on my way.

536
00:38:09,260 --> 00:38:10,630
Nom Jued.

537
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:12,400
I'm sorry.

538
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:14,330
I'll give you a ride next time.

539
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:16,630
Oh, really?

540
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:20,920
That's fine. Next time, okay?

541
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:21,930
Mm.

542
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:24,330
See you at the cafe tomorrow, okay?

543
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:34,140
I've had a meeting with the committee

544
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:37,990
about the Sony World Photography Awards,

545
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:42,570
and we've discussed that we'll pick
one of your works to exhibit there.

546
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:48,280
Moreover, the chosen candidate will be
100% funded for the photography award,

547
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,200
which is either you

548
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:51,560
or you.

549
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:55,910
What do you mean, Professor?

550
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:58,050
We have to compete against each other?

551
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:01,730
Yes.

552
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:03,620
Like always.

553
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:06,130
What's the criteria?

554
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:08,730
If it's past projects,

555
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:12,200
I guess he deserves the spot.

556
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:15,450
No, it's much simpler.

557
00:39:15,490 --> 00:39:18,980
It's all up to me.

558
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:23,160
How will you choose one over the other?

559
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:33,260
Both of your final projects
are exhibitions, right?

560
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:35,800
That's the final frontier.

561
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:36,840
It's a fair game.

562
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,160
Are you sure that our final projects

563
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:41,200
are the only factor for such a massive event?

564
00:39:41,470 --> 00:39:42,340
He has a point.

565
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:45,530
Yes.

566
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,440
But I will not tell you the details.

567
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:50,970
It all depends on your exhibition.

568
00:39:52,650 --> 00:39:53,530
Good luck.

569
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:15,000
Why do I always have to compete against you?

570
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:18,180
Maybe we're evenly matched.

571
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:22,140
Do you know that

572
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:24,660
I've never wanted to compete against you?

573
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:28,270
Really?

574
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:30,090
But I have.

575
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:33,880
Take this as a pity request.

576
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:38,020
You've won in the past.

577
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:39,650
God.

578
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:41,770
That event wasn't even a big one.

579
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,360
I lucked out.

580
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:45,400
I was chosen because it suited his taste.

581
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:48,160
I'm about to graduate,

582
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,650
and finding gigs is already hard as it is.

583
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:53,480
Unlike you.

584
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:56,020
You always have gigs coming your way.

585
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:01,090
You've already bought back your buffalo, too.

586
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:06,080
I fucking hate you.

587
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:09,010
So you're not backing down, huh?

588
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:10,680
I am not.

589
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:13,680
The same goes for Nom Jued.

590
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:16,950
What about him?

591
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:29,760
["Good luck on your exam" from Korn]

592
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:42,530
I know that you're hitting on him.

593
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:45,490
Although I'm not as good-looking as you,

594
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:49,210
I will show him how much I love him.

595
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:50,940
Fine.

596
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:52,820
I'm hitting on Nom Jued.

597
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:54,960
And I'm very serious about it.

598
00:41:57,920 --> 00:41:59,190
Let's make it a fair fight.

599
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:08,500
Bring it.

600
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:09,800
Sure!

601
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:11,320
You're gonna have to deal with me.

602
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:12,360
We'll see about that.

603
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:14,220
I'm not backing down.

604
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:16,180
So am I.

605
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:22,170
Hey!

606
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:24,440
We're discussing our project.

607
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:25,690
It's not what you think, Professor.

608
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:27,100
That's what we're doing, Professor.

609
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,210
- Where were we?
- Oh...

610
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:30,440
It's that topic.

611
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:33,600
It's the photo shoot.

612
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:35,320
- Oh, with that camera?
- Yeah.

613
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:36,840
Okay, okay. I'll go away now.

614
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:37,880
Good luck.

615
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:08,970
Why is he on my mind?!

616
00:43:23,450 --> 00:43:28,000
[Satrupai: Have you had dinner?]

617
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:32,520
[Phra Rong: I haven't]

618
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:45,400
[Satrupai: I'll treat you to one
at the noodle shop, as promised]

619
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:49,960
[Phra Rong: My class finishes at 10 P.M.]

620
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:54,360
[Satrupai: That's fine, I don’t mind waiting]

621
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:19,080
Took you forever.

622
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:21,350
Every restaurant here is closed.

623
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:26,950
Hey.

624
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:30,280
I apologize.

625
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:39,380
Whatever.

626
00:44:40,020 --> 00:44:41,360
Come to my place.

627
00:45:07,020 --> 00:45:07,920
Good?

628
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:24,430
Hey.

629
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:26,580
Just finish it already.

630
00:45:27,080 --> 00:45:28,020
Bugs are everywhere.

631
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:32,080
You can just go on without me.

632
00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:35,840
No.

633
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:37,790
It's my plate you're using.

634
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:40,130
What would I eat food with
if you stole it?

635
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:45,860
Then...

636
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:48,420
Let me finish this in your room.

637
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:52,220
That's so out of line.

638
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:54,860
We're not that close, you know?

639
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,270
Aww, how upsetting.

640
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:05,360
I even gave you a ride and everything.

641
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:08,280
Yet, we're still not that close?

642
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:11,160
Let me be clear.

643
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:14,570
I haven't even brought my friends
to my room.

644
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:19,290
I only once shared my room
with your fraternity brother.

645
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:21,340
And who do you think you are
to visit my room?

646
00:46:23,840 --> 00:46:24,700
Really?

647
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:27,580
You've never taken your partner to your room?

648
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:30,100
If I had one, I would've done it.

649
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:34,610
Right.

650
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:36,640
You have a point

651
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:38,510
because a few days ago,

652
00:46:39,640 --> 00:46:41,210
you wished for one.

653
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:42,960
Fucking hell.

654
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:43,980
Just finish it already.

655
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:51,800
Hey! Hey!

656
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:53,400
Easy!

657
00:46:57,400 --> 00:46:58,270
Have a drink.

658
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:11,760
Don't just do everything I say.

659
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:17,160
I just...

660
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:19,890
I just don't want you to feel uncomfortable.

661
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:23,040
I know,

662
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:30,160
but I'm not used to being treated this much.

663
00:47:31,160 --> 00:47:32,160
Even...

664
00:47:35,720 --> 00:47:39,330
My parents didn't even treat me this well.

665
00:47:41,240 --> 00:47:43,000
So how am I supposed to feel about

666
00:47:43,640 --> 00:47:44,850
you helping me out?

667
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:47,950
It's fine.

668
00:47:49,080 --> 00:47:50,170
I'm happy to help.

669
00:47:52,040 --> 00:47:53,670
All I want is...

670
00:47:56,300 --> 00:47:57,300
Is?

671
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:01,850
Let me see you every day.

672
00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:03,400
Okay?

673
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:07,010
Give me some me-time.

674
00:48:09,160 --> 00:48:10,590
How about this?

675
00:48:11,080 --> 00:48:13,220
I'll text you if you're free.

676
00:48:14,040 --> 00:48:15,380
You have to tell me your availability.

677
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:17,350
Is that okay?

678
00:48:19,080 --> 00:48:19,970
Fine.

679
00:48:41,560 --> 00:48:43,100
Whoa! A ghost!

680
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:44,610
Fuck!

681
00:48:46,080 --> 00:48:47,080
It's a ghost!

682
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:50,200
That's okay.

683
00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:51,750
Ghosts are scary, no?

684
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:53,770
Why are you scared, Mr. Pai?

685
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:56,720
I treated my skin like this every day,
and you're still not used to it?

686
00:48:56,760 --> 00:48:58,410
Aww, Mr. Security!

687
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:00,170
You scared the life out of me.

688
00:49:03,600 --> 00:49:04,960
Okay, I'll be on my way now.

689
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:06,250
Enjoy yourselves.

690
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:07,440
Enjoy yourselves, okay?

691
00:49:17,640 --> 00:49:19,170
Mr. Pai, have you seen
my bottle of strawberry soda?

692
00:49:19,240 --> 00:49:20,180
It was right there.

693
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:22,100
I gave it to Rong already.

694
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:26,300
What about it?

695
00:49:29,640 --> 00:49:30,670
He drank it?

696
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:36,400
It was for the shrine.

697
00:49:42,520 --> 00:49:43,930
I need to get a new one now.

698
00:49:44,360 --> 00:49:45,660
I gotta go!

699
00:49:46,120 --> 00:49:46,930
Oh...

700
00:49:48,040 --> 00:49:48,960
Shit.

701
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:54,160
We're in trouble now.

702
00:49:54,760 --> 00:49:55,760
We really are.

703
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:57,520
Good luck sleeping tonight.

704
00:49:58,240 --> 00:49:59,570
- Better keep your eyes open.
- Ow...

705
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:15,530
Why is Korn still not here?

706
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:22,030
Whoa, what's going on, Nom Jued?

707
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:24,130
Do you need to set it all up yourself?

708
00:50:24,840 --> 00:50:25,840
How strange.

709
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:28,670
I thought it'd come pre-assembled.

710
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:32,840
If it's done, please make it quick,

711
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:34,030
in case there's a customer, okay?

712
00:50:34,600 --> 00:50:35,420
Alright.

713
00:50:55,080 --> 00:50:56,080
Hello, Korn.

714
00:50:56,120 --> 00:50:57,320
Hi, Nom Jued.

715
00:50:57,360 --> 00:50:59,280
I'm working on a project.

716
00:50:59,320 --> 00:51:01,760
I don't think I'll be there in time.

717
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:05,160
Can you follow the instructions I gave you?

718
00:51:05,960 --> 00:51:07,940
Okay, sure.

719
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:14,840
It's fine, Korn.

720
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:17,840
I'll give it a try.

721
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:18,880
Good luck.

722
00:51:25,080 --> 00:51:26,200
So what is it, Nom Jued?

723
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:28,040
Are we good to go?

724
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:30,950
Huh?

725
00:51:32,520 --> 00:51:34,290
Don't look away.

726
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:35,600
Hurry.

727
00:51:47,480 --> 00:51:48,610
Here I go!

728
00:52:26,440 --> 00:52:27,440
What do I do?

729
00:52:44,360 --> 00:52:45,550
Hello, Phra Aek.

730
00:52:48,120 --> 00:52:49,120
What's up?

731
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:50,760
Um...

732
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:53,900
I need your help.

733
00:52:54,120 --> 00:52:58,920
I told the owner of a cafe that
I'd do a promotional shoot for his cafe.

734
00:53:00,080 --> 00:53:02,090
Are you free? Can you come and help me?

735
00:53:04,560 --> 00:53:07,200
Korn is currently busy.

736
00:53:07,960 --> 00:53:13,510
I thought the equipment he gave me
would be pre-assembled.

737
00:53:13,550 --> 00:53:16,140
But that's not the case, Phra Aek.

738
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:18,520
What am I supposed to do?

739
00:53:21,160 --> 00:53:22,830
Okay, give me a second.

740
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:25,140
Where's the cafe?
Send me the location.

741
00:53:26,840 --> 00:53:28,080
Thank you so much, Phra Aek.

742
00:53:28,320 --> 00:53:29,840
I'll send it to you right away.

743
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:41,960
Jued!

744
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:45,620
Phra Aek!

745
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:03,410
I wanna look cool.

746
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:05,150
You, of all people?!

747
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:06,280
Whoa!

748
00:54:06,320 --> 00:54:07,810
What are you doing, Phra Aek?!

749
00:54:08,260 --> 00:54:09,420
Getting changed, of course.

750
00:54:09,640 --> 00:54:11,270
Do you want me to freeze to death?

751
00:54:11,600 --> 00:54:13,120
If it's still new to you,

752
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:16,650
would you like to try that again?
