1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,600
The sky is dark, the earth is silent

2
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:41,100
Episode 1

3
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:49,000
I heard that Prince of Yuechang is not very well lately.

4
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,600
Is His Majesty worried about it?

5
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,000
The longer he is, the more mysterious he will be.

6
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,400
He will be surrounded by soldiers.

7
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:58,200
Although Prince of Yuechang is the local governor,

8
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:03,000
but actually, the most important thing is the life of the local people.

9
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
How do you know these things?

10
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I have been to Yuechang since I was little.

11
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,400
I have been to the hospital to seek medical treatment.

12
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,800
But unfortunately, I have not gone far.

13
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:23,000
Your Majesty, can I ask for a favor?

14
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,800
Every day, I need to go to the Imperial Medical Academy

15
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:29,200
to enter the Imperial Medical Academy to check on the medical books.

16
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,800
I can do it for half an hour.

17
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:45,000
Although I have a favor to ask,

18
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,600
I will not give you any sincerity.

19
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:00,200
You are a very young and young son.

20
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:03,200
Are they all fake?

21
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,800
Is that enough?

22
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,200
Not enough.

23
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,800
Is that enough?

24
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,600
Not enough.

25
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,800
What's wrong with you?

26
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,800
You are really wrong.

27
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,800
Why are you so hurt?

28
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:36,800
I am sick.

29
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,800
Sick?

30
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,400
I am sick.

31
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,600
Master, it's late. Do you want to send Xiao Ye?

32
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,200
No need.

33
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:19,800
Wait.

34
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:23,800
Send some Yan Zhi Peach Flower Pond and Furong River Flower Pond.

35
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,800
Is it for Princess An Yang? You never eat these.

36
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,800
Don't ask if you shouldn't.

37
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,800
I know. It must be for Miss Nan Gong.

38
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,800
Madam, I have not found the antidote.

39
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,400
Master is not satisfied with your food.

40
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,400
He might have killed Xiao Ye.

41
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,400
You must do me a favor.

42
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:55,000
Find a chance to kill Su Wu Yang.

43
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,400
As long as you listen to me,

44
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:01,000
I will not stop Cheng Erliang.

45
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
What are you doing?

46
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Why are you here?

47
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,560
How dare you finish the food?

48
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:09,600
What a hypocrite!

49
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,600
Do you think it belongs to me?

50
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:25,700
Young Lord Nan,

51
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:26,900
Please listen to me.

52
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:27,900
Listen to me.

53
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:45,100
Ying!

54
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:47,700
Ying!

55
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,100
Ying, where are you?

56
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:59,700
Brother Wu Yang, I'm here.

57
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:02,700
Ying!

58
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:04,700
Brother Wu Yang,

59
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:07,700
we won't separate anymore, okay?

60
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:08,700
Okay.

61
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:10,700
I'll always protect you.

62
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:13,700
Brother Wu Yang, you still can't bear to see Ying.

63
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:16,700
Ying.

64
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:21,700
But Ying only wants Brother Wu Yang to die.

65
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:27,700
Brother Wu Yang,

66
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:29,700
I'm here.

67
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:31,700
I'm here.

68
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:33,700
I'm here.

69
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:35,700
I'm here.

70
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:37,700
I'm here.

71
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:39,700
I'm here.

72
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:41,700
I'm here.

73
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:43,700
I'm here.

74
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:45,700
I'm here.

75
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:47,700
I'm here.

76
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:49,700
I'm here.

77
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:51,700
I'm here.

78
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:53,700
I'm here.

79
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:55,700
I'm here.

80
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:25,700
Brother Wu Yang,

81
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:27,700
I'm sorry.

82
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:29,700
I'm not safe.

83
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:40,700
Five years ago, you wanted to kill me.

84
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:42,700
Five years later,

85
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:46,700
you wanted to kill me.

86
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:50,700
Five years later,

87
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:51,700
you wanted to kill me.

88
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:58,700
What did you do?

89
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:00,700
What did you do?

90
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:02,700
I had no choice.

91
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:03,700
I had no choice but to kill you.

92
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:10,700
I'm not going to let you

93
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:13,700
kill me again.

94
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:22,700
Okay.

95
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:25,700
Since you wanted to kill me,

96
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:27,700
I'm willing to do it.

97
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:37,700
My heart was dead five years ago.

98
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:42,700
Now, what's the point of dying again?

99
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:49,700
Is it that high?

100
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:51,700
No.

101
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:57,700
You're not enough.

102
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:00,700
Then take my heart.

103
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:04,700
And then move.

104
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:11,700
This time,

105
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:14,700
you're lying to me.

106
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:16,700
I shouldn't have believed you.

107
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:19,700
You're so sincere to me.

108
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:21,760
I hate her!

109
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:23,560
Don't cry.

110
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:27,700
Although I didn't see her for 6 months

111
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:28,540
Until this failure today

112
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:29,620
She looks uranium-acid

113
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:30,320
Stay still

114
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:34,480
Stop

115
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,020
為何

116
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,560
I want to be like you

117
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:39,840
Stay still

118
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:40,940
We go without beginning

119
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:42,540
Will you feel pain?

120
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,420
おい

121
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:19,480
Organizer

122
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:35,960
The green lake has been fooled

123
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,960
I'm afraid I'll be able to do nothing.

124
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,960
I'm afraid I'll be able to do nothing.

125
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,960
I'm afraid I'll be able to do nothing.

126
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,960
I'm afraid I'll be able to do nothing.

127
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,960
I'm afraid I'll be able to do nothing.

128
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,960
I'm afraid I'll be able to do nothing.

129
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,960
I'm afraid I'll be able to do nothing.

130
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,960
I'm afraid I'll be able to do nothing.

131
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,960
I'm afraid I'll be able to do nothing.

132
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,960
I'm afraid I'll be able to do nothing.

133
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,960
I'm afraid I'll be able to do nothing.

134
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,960
I'm afraid I'll be able to do nothing.

135
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,960
I'm afraid I'll be able to do nothing.

136
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,960
I'm afraid I'll be able to do nothing.

137
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:06,180
grub it with all my will to breathe.

138
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:11,960
as if the ninety-first rain 쵤 from the ج Template

139
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:14,060
Even if it falls short of our world,

140
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:26,160
Let racing my carry you towards final in all hands

141
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:31,160
The moment we met, we were so far apart

142
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:37,160
We were so close, we were so close

143
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:42,160
We were so close, we were so close

144
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:45,160
We were so close, we were so close

145
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:51,160
We were so close, we were so close

146
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:56,160
We were so close, we were so close

147
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:01,160
We were so close
