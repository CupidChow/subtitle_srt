The universe shims and realityồ

00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:40,200
Episode 77

3
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:45,300
Duke Shaoqikuan, forgive the delay

4
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:47,040
DANIEL & LAND� safe

5
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:48,160
deals with 32

6
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:52,540
Finally i can see the general you were thinking about

7
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:55,740
I am thinking about meeting Cheng Er

8
00:00:58,320 --> 00:00:59,860
Your majesty

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm innocent.

10
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I hope His Majesty won't...

11
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Is this how you treat people?

12
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
It's getting cold outside.

13
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
You should go earlier.

14
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
His Majesty should also be careful not to catch a cold.

15
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I'll take this opportunity to treat you to a meal.

16
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Mother!

17
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Let me take a good look at Cheng'er.

18
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Mother, my grandfather told me to tell you.

19
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Hurry up and go home after you finish your work.

20
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Otherwise, Cheng'er's medicine will be finished soon.

21
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Mother will be back soon.

22
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Master,

23
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I don't think Young Master Pei Jia is not as good as Pei Xian.

24
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
He is similar to you.

25
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Especially his eyes.

26
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
He is so similar.

27
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Hurry up and go!

28
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
The people in the village, follow me!

29
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Yes!

30
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Sister!

31
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Brother, hurry up and go!

32
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Hurry up and go!

33
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Yes!

34
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Sister, I can't leave you here alone.

35
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I'll take you away from Su Wuyang Mountain.

36
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
He is a military official.

37
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
He is the emperor's concubine.

38
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I should take the punishment.

39
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Don't you want the honor you got from the bloodbath?

40
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
It's useless without you and me.

41
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Pei Xian, remember.

42
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
You are a general who loves the country.

43
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
You are not a traitor who takes the punishment.

44
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Let's go far away.

45
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
We'll be out of this.

46
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
What about Cheng'er?

47
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
What about Pei Jia?

48
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
You go back first.

49
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Take care of Cheng'er.

50
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I'll find a way to get back as soon as possible.

51
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Sister, wait for me to get the route.

52
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I'll take you home next time.

53
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
His Majesty has been here for a long time.

54
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Of course, it's a long time.

55
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
And the harem is not empty.

56
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
You and Zhiwei's marriage should be prepared for the end.

57
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
What the Nangang King said is true.

58
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I've been thinking about this for a while.

59
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
His Majesty is still young.

60
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
He should think about it before and after.

61
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:48,000
It's a long time.

62
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Your Majesty, don't let me wait until the day of the first lord of the country.

63
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Nangang King is so bold.

64
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
How dare he be so bold in front of His Majesty?

65
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Nangang King, Nangang King.

66
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
You always think for me.

67
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I'm kind-hearted.

68
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Gu Yu, send people to send the precious herbs of the north to the palace.

69
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:22,000
It's my own intention to send the precious herbs to the Nangang King's Mansion.

70
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,000
The precious herbs of the north are the precious herbs of the north.

71
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
We can't do anything about them.

72
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:35,000
We need to know what His Majesty wants more.

73
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I'm leaving.

74
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Master, I've checked it.

75
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Nangong is right.

76
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
It's been five years since the palace was built.

77
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
The army of Chengchang is really the same as General Pei's.

78
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Kill! Kill!

79
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I'm sorry.

80
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I'm sorry.

81
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
General Pei's army is really the same as General Chengchang's.

82
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Kill! Kill!

83
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
It was just a secret.

84
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
There was no evidence.

85
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Your Majesty, you are so cold.

86
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I made a bracelet for you.

87
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
You made it yourself.

88
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
It's so rough.

89
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
It's also suitable for me.

90
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I think it's good.

91
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Master, if you don't want it, give it to me.

92
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
If you don't mind, take it.

93
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I'll make another bracelet for His Majesty when I'm ready.

94
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I'll prepare the water for you.

95
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
This is from Miss Nangong.

96
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Master, you didn't want it first.

97
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Who said I didn't want it?

98
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I know you're drunk.

99
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Are you going to the wedding again tonight?

100
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
As a maid, this little thing is not good.

101
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I'm sorry.

102
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
You used to be like this.

103
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I'm sorry.

104
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I'm sorry.

105
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I'm sorry.

106
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I'm sorry.

107
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I'm sorry.

108
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I'm sorry.

109
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I'm sorry.

110
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I'm sorry.

111
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I'm sorry.

112
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I'm sorry.

113
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I'm sorry.

114
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I'm sorry.

115
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I'm sorry.

116
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I'm sorry.

117
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I'm sorry.

118
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I'm sorry.

119
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
I'm sorry.
