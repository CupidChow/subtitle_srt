1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,680
Remember the beautiful last moments of our life

2
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:37,700
The endingonde

3
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:40,800
Episode 12

4
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,600
Her life will be taken personal by me

5
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:47,720
I ordered you to enter the palace

6
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:49,880
but if you woman once you're really kidnapped

7
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:50,820
why did you killing my prince-in- PP

8
00:00:58,020 --> 00:00:59,520
Then keep PrincekiemWu Yunie's leading position

9
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,520
I have to interrogate myself!

10
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:19,520
I haven't seen you in a long time.

11
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:21,520
Why?

12
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:24,520
You came back alive?

13
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:27,520
Are you unhappy?

14
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:30,520
I'm glad you can come back safely.

15
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,520
But you shouldn't.

16
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:36,520
Where should I be?

17
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:38,520
Should I treat you like a dead person?

18
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:40,520
Or should I be a fool?

19
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:44,520
Shouldn't you tell me?

20
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:50,520
I'm sorry.

21
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,520
I've arranged for you to stay with Su Wu Yang for so many years.

22
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:01,520
I didn't get any useful information.

23
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:03,520
What's the use of asking you?

24
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:05,520
I'll give you one last chance.

25
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:07,520
If you kill Su Wu Yang tonight,

26
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,520
you and Qi Yue will be free.

27
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:13,520
I was forced to do it.

28
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,520
Killing is a crime.

29
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,520
Is it a crime to marry Pei Xian?

30
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,520
Your Majesty, you're innocent.

31
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,520
How can you be so lucky?

32
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,520
You're so bold.

33
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,520
How dare you attack me?

34
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,520
I really don't want to see you.

35
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:42,520
I just want to be with you.

36
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:49,520
You're so good at making excuses.

37
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:53,520
It's a crime to kill someone who's a criminal.

38
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,520
If you're not mistaken,

39
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,520
everyone in Pei family will be implicated.

40
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,520
It's a big deal.

41
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,520
General Pei,

42
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,520
you must think it over.

43
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:12,520
Nangongying has married into my family.

44
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,520
If you're guilty,

45
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,520
I'll bear the responsibility.

46
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:19,520
Don't think that you're so hard-working.

47
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,520
I can't stand you.

48
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,520
The crime I committed

49
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,520
is my return as husband.

50
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,520
Since I'm willing to die,

51
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,520
I'll take it.

52
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,520
Qi Zhi, no!

53
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,520
Nangongying, let go.

54
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,520
I told you to let go.

55
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,520
You don't believe in your life.

56
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,520
Su Ya,

57
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:54,520
it's none of your business with me.

58
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:56,520
It's none of your business with me.

59
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,520
If you have to kill him today,

60
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,520
then kill me first.

61
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,520
Your Majesty,

62
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,520
he's my wife.

63
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,520
I won't let you touch him.

64
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:17,520
How dare you

65
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:19,520
kill the Ninth Emperor?

66
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:20,520
A Xian,

67
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:21,520
don't be so rash.

68
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:23,520
I'm not afraid of the consequences

69
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,520
of the crime.

70
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:25,520
I'll go back and take care of Cheng'er.

71
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:27,520
Qi Zhi,

72
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,520
I won't leave.

73
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,520
I promised Cheng'er

74
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,520
that I'll take you back.

75
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,520
Chen Zhen hasn't changed his mind yet.

76
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,520
Get out of here.

77
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,520
Otherwise,

78
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:42,520
I'll be exposed to Nangongying.

79
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:43,520
Go.

80
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,520
Throw out the general.

81
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,520
Why?

82
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:49,520
Don't you want to be the general?

83
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:51,520
Pei Xian is innocent.

84
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,520
I'm innocent.

85
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,520
Don't be angry with him.

86
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:56,520
You really love your little general.

87
00:04:58,520 --> 00:04:59,520
Why didn't you say anything?

88
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:01,520
I was right.

89
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,520
If the Queen

90
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:04,520
can't bear to be with Pei family anymore,

91
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:07,520
I can use

92
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,520
Pei Xian's blood to make a move.

93
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:27,520
No.

94
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,320
She may have been caresfree

95
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,520
but nearby she got assignment to keep herateurs.

96
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:33,520
I heard that

97
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,960
Prime Minister Pei came to plead for His Majesty'sக

98
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,520
heiska and wanted to take her back

99
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:37,520
to be almost punished by His Majesty.

100
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:39,520
Who asked Prime Minister Pei

101
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,520
to attend the cabinet?

102
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,020
She's just a rascal.

103
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,760
The emperor hasn't found no one.

104
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:46,520
He already married her.

105
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:47,520
She was just sweetнов.

106
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,520
She was just means of the present.

107
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,520
Fifth Brother Yang,

108
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,520
five years ago, you were alive.

109
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,520
You finally survived.

110
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,520
Why did you come back?

111
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:04,520
You came back to this place of failure.

112
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,520
Fifth Brother Yang,

113
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,520
in this life,

114
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,520
you are willing to be with the emperor

115
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:14,520
and enjoy the spring and autumn months together.

116
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:16,520
Fifth Brother Yang!

117
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,520
Fifth Brother Yang!

118
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,520
Su Wu Yang,

119
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:46,520
you shouldn't have come back to this palace of a person.

120
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:49,520
You shouldn't have put me by your side

121
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,520
and risk your life.

122
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:01,520
This gold medal is from His Majesty.

123
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,520
Is it beautiful?

124
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:04,520
Your Highness, you are born in the south of the country.

125
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:06,520
You are the most beautiful person in the south of the country.

126
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:12,520
Your Highness,

127
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,520
the South Palace is surrounded by His Majesty.

128
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,520
What did you say?

129
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:17,520
Your Highness, don't be angry.

130
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,520
I think it's better to tell His Highness

131
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,520
not to have a long night.

132
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:25,520
You are so shameless.

133
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:28,520
Why did you ask me to be here?

134
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:31,520
I want you to be in my control.

135
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,520
Without my permission,

136
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,520
you can't go anywhere.

137
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:40,520
Su Wu Yang,

138
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:41,520
are you crazy?

139
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,520
Even if you have the power now,

140
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:46,520
you can't force me.

141
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:48,520
You are right.

142
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,520
I am crazy.

143
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:54,520
Are you still blaming me?

144
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:56,520
You taught me this.

145
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:59,520
Since you can still stand in front of me,

146
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,520
you should know that I was the one who was in love.

147
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:06,520
Then should I thank you?

148
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:11,520
Thank you for saving my life.

149
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:15,520
I only beg Your Majesty not to be in front of Ah Xian.

150
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,520
You are still so angry.

151
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:20,520
You are still talking to her in front of me.

152
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:23,520
You are really so serious.

153
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,520
What did I say wrong?

154
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:32,520
You want me to let her go?

155
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,520
Fine.

156
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:36,520
Then use your body

157
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:38,520
to redeem her sin.

158
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:41,520
I will redeem her sin.

159
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:49,520
Princess.

160
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:55,520
Nanguang, you are a bitch.

161
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:03,520
Your Majesty, this woman made you risk your life.

162
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:05,520
She turned around and married Pei Xian.

163
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:07,520
She gave birth to Ye Zhong.

164
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:09,520
You still protect her?

165
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:11,520
Who is Ye Zhong?

166
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:13,520
You married two people in three months.

167
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:15,520
You are so kind.

168
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:17,520
The rest of the children are not Ye Zhong.

169
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:19,520
What do you think they are?

170
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,520
You bitch.

171
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:25,520
How dare you hit me?

172
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:28,520
My children can't even take your life.

173
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:30,520
You...

174
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:33,520
When the first person to hit this woman

175
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:36,520
will be the one who killed Princess An Yang,

176
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:40,520
who will hurt Princess An Yang

177
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:42,520
for your sake?

178
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:43,520
Guards.

179
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,520
Yes.

180
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,520
Bring the male shadow to me.

181
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:48,520
Yes.

182
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:54,520
I just sent someone

183
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:57,520
to send a new pearl to your palace.

184
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:59,520
You think I am a fool?

185
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:01,520
I will give you a lift.

186
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:03,520
Really?

187
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,520
I will go and see.

188
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:09,520
Wait for me in the South Palace.

189
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:17,520
