00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,600
The sky and earth are silent and silent

00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:40,600
Episode 1

3
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:44,400
How dare you! Stop me!

4
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:45,300
Your Majesty!

5
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:48,000
Nanguanyin, what do you want?

6
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,800
Princess Anyang wants to see someone to insult me.

7
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:56,200
But the person she loves is Princess Anyang.

8
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:59,800
I even saved her.

9
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:02,300
As a woman,

10
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:05,800
you think that if there is no one to be innocent,

11
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:08,400
I should kill you.

12
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,100
Today, I saved you.

13
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:15,400
Princess Anyang, do you remember your gratitude?

14
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:21,400
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

15
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:23,200
Your Majesty!

16
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,000
You want to kill me?

17
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,800
You must be the one to hold me. You must catch her!

18
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:32,300
I'm trapped here. I can't even see your face.

19
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:33,600
How can I kill you?

20
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:37,400
You liar! You lied to me!

21
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:42,000
Your Majesty, look! My hand is too red.

22
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,800
You must be the one to hold me, Your Majesty!

23
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:47,000
Princess Anyang is too kind.

24
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,700
I'm afraid that she will still save her life here.

25
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:55,200
Then punish her to go to Hanzhang Hall to avoid her.

26
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:02,200
Your Majesty, she is going to kill me!

27
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,700
You still want her to go to Hanzhang Hall?

28
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:06,100
No! I want to kill her!

29
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:08,000
Kill her?

30
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:13,600
I heard that someone has given up a request today.

31
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:17,600
Do you know what Princess Anyang is doing?

32
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:23,600
The Southern Palace should insult Princess Anyang and take the punishment.

33
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:27,400
You must be the one to punish her to go to Hanzhang Hall.

34
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:30,000
I can finally go out.

35
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,800
I think Su Wu Yang is still alive.

36
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:40,600
I'm afraid that someone has been too kind to her.

37
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,400
Please take care of her.

38
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,800
You misunderstood me.

39
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,000
Ying is better than anyone else.

40
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,600
I hope that Su Wu Yang will die without any funeral.

41
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:56,000
You have already known my identity as the General of the Moon.

42
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,400
I was the Princess of Moon Empire, which was destroyed by Zhou Empire 18 years ago.

43
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,400
Su Wu Yang's father killed my family and my family.

44
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:09,400
How could I be merciful to the people of the Moon?

45
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,700
Is that so?

46
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:18,800
But now, Su Wu Yang is no longer the crown prince who was captured by the people five years ago.

47
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:23,600
We need to break the rules of the seven languages and make the King of the Southern Empire and Su Wu Yang rebel.

48
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:27,400
By then, the General will be able to take the command of Yu Weng.

49
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,400
What do you think?

50
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:37,800
General Pei Xiao has been kneeling in the palace for a whole night.

51
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:43,600
Your Majesty, I have a minor illness.

52
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:46,100
I came to take my wife home.

53
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:48,600
The Southern Palace is the body of the guilty.

54
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:51,800
How can you take her back?

55
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:57,000
I have 100,000 soldiers of Pei's family. I will surely be in trouble for His Majesty.

56
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I am willing to take revenge on you and punish you for my wife's crime.

57
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,000
You are threatening me.

58
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,200
I dare not. I just want to take back my wife.

59
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,400
Your wife?

60
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:18,600
General Pei Xiao, don't forget.

61
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:22,800
Since childhood, the Southern Palace has always been mine.

62
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:27,800
You are not qualified to be my woman.

63
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,800
Then please don't forget, Your Majesty.

64
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,800
Before her, I had a child.

65
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,800
Our half of the body is much more than yours.

66
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:56,000
Your half of the body is much more meaningful

67
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
than mine.

68
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,200
Between you and her,

69
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:05,000
you are already past.

70
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,600
As long as I am not dead,

71
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,000
the Southern Palace will always be mine.

72
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:19,400
booked Xie You

73
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:30,000
If Your Majesty refuse and won't吧

74
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,200
It's not my fault anymore.

75
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,820
In this day and age you worked so hard that you've had un素

76
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:39,900
I am not afraid to damage your body.

77
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,060
Right!

78
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:47,500
It's the time to ask me

79
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:48,860
what to item up.

80
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:08,620
Yourodo!

81
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:10,620
This is the Hanzhang Hall.

82
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:12,620
You're so afraid of being seen?

83
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:18,620
His Majesty just got promoted.

84
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:20,620
If this is the rumor spread,

85
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:22,620
I'll be afraid of His Majesty.

86
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:23,620
Let me go.

87
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:24,620
You're begging me?

88
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:11,620
This is the chance you've been dreaming about.

89
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:33,620
Are you okay?

90
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:37,620
You're also cold.

91
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:40,620
You should rest early.

92
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:03,620
Brother Wu Yang,

93
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:05,620
I will be with you forever.

94
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:07,620
I will be with you forever.

95
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:09,620
I will be with you forever.

96
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:35,620
I will be with you forever.

97
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:05,620
I will be with you forever.

98
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:35,620
The End
