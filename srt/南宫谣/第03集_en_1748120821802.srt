1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:44,360
The God's

2
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:45,420
Her Highness.

3
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:01,620
Your Highness, not at all ok.

4
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:03,520
His Majesty will kill him for sure.

5
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:12,040
Your Highness!

6
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:14,200
You are the 18th best cookess ever!

7
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:16,080
You two, put her down!

8
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:16,960
Yes.

9
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,760
You two are so selfish.

10
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:32,520
I'm the queen of Su Wuyang.

11
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:34,360
I'm a criminal.

12
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:35,560
What's selfish?

13
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:36,280
It's true.

14
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:38,560
You're the queen, aren't you?

15
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:40,400
The South Palace won.

16
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,800
You're not only good at guarding,

17
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,520
but also good at keeping your mouth shut.

18
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,200
It's okay.

19
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:49,240
Today, I'll teach you a lesson.

20
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,760
What's the rule?

21
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,520
Be brave.

22
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,120
I'll let this bitch

23
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,720
never beat anyone again.

24
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,040
Yes, Your Highness.

25
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:47,800
The King of Su Wuyang

26
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,400
Episode 1

27
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,640
You're right.

28
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:53,680
I'm not suitable for the title of

29
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,640
the King of Su Wuyang.

30
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,040
Your Majesty.

31
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:02,080
Your Majesty.

32
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,280
Your Majesty, you're here.

33
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,600
Your Majesty, are you heartbroken?

34
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:09,960
Don't forget.

35
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,880
How did the woman betray you?

36
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:18,680
Was she Sophie Wu's boyfriend or your smuggler?

37
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:19,680
Why not?

38
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,200
I've told you a long time ago,

39
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:27,540
you серver

40
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,520
will not stop me

41
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,280
from Elsa the Envoy of the South Palace.

42
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:34,880
So bold,

43
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,800
spécial.

44
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:41,600
You dare to ruin Na Ying's life?

45
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,160
I'm sorry, Father.

46
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:43,760
Go.

47
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,040
I don't know what to do, Your Majesty.

48
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,000
Please stop.

49
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,040
Xiao Wan.

50
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,240
Don't forget.

51
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:50,480
But my father gave you the chance to go back to the capital.

52
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,240
Do you want to go to the bridge?

53
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:55,840
I promised you that I would do what you and Nang Jiang Wang did.

54
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,520
I left him.

55
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,840
I did it to torture him.

56
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,920
I want you to live.

57
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:05,280
I didn't find out what Prince Ji did to you.

58
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,200
You can't have anything to do

59
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:10,000
before you hide it.

60
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:16,960
I'm afraid I'll be in trouble.

61
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:17,920
How is it?

62
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,680
Mrs. Pei has been too considerate.

63
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,720
She has a weak body and a wound.

64
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,760
If we don't use the temperature of Yuhuang Mountain,

65
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:28,400
we'll be in trouble for the next few days.

66
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:31,280
He can use the temperature of the royal family.

67
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,440
I'll take my leave.

68
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:36,960
Master.

69
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,680
You're so thoughtful.

70
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,680
You're even against the memorial.

71
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:43,840
Father.

72
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:46,240
How did you get the space to enter the palace today?

73
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,080
When did Su Wuyang get down?

74
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,760
He's just trying to protect you.

75
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,200
I don't know.

76
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,560
I think he's almost there.

77
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,320
You're a fool.

78
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:01,280
Why can't you even climb up Su Wuyang's bed?

79
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,360
I'm not a fool.

80
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:09,280
I don't care what you do.

81
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:12,880
Just wait for the empress to die.

82
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:19,280
If you really can't do anything,

83
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,280
you'll have to kill Su Wuyang

84
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,280
and use your death to get to the throne.

85
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,240
Princess.

86
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,600
Are you all right?

87
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:35,280
You're just insulting my daughter.

88
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,600
What could have done to her?

89
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,040
You're suddenly mad.

90
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:41,120
I wouldn't want to offend her.

91
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,680
Subscribe now.

92
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,800
Father, why doesn't a dehisc from your father

93
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,080
feel so good?

94
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,600
The warmth of the yellow mountain is good for you.

95
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,600
If you don't want to die, just obediently listen to me.

96
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,600
Where have you never seen your body?

97
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,600
What are you pretending to be?

98
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,600
I already have my husband and child.

99
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,600
I'm different from before.

100
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,600
If your husband and child

101
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,600
know that you are now with another man,

102
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,600
will they still want you?

103
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,600
Your Majesty, you should be the most lenient one.

104
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,600
What's wrong with you?

105
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,600
I'm sorry, Yinghe.

106
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,600
What are you pretending to be?

107
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,600
You didn't make this face?

108
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,600
If Your Majesty insisted that I did it,

109
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,600
my life would be ruined.

110
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,600
I killed you.

111
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,600
It's too easy for you.

112
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,600
Nangong Yan,

113
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,600
remember this.

114
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,600
Your life is real.

115
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,600
Your body is also real.

116
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,600
Your Majesty.

117
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,600
The song is a golden lake, a lake and a lake.

118
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,600
I embroidered you a unique cloud.

119
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,600
I embroidered you a unique cloud.

120
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,600
I embroidered you a unique cloud.

121
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,600
I embroidered you a unique cloud.

122
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,600
I embroidered you a unique cloud.

123
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,600
I embroidered you a unique cloud.

124
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,600
I embroidered you a unique cloud.

125
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,600
I embroidered you a unique cloud.

126
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,600
I embroidered you a unique cloud.

127
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,600
I embroidered you a unique cloud.

128
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:32,600
I embroidered you a unique cloud.

129
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,600
I embroidered you a unique cloud.

130
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,600
I embroidered you a unique cloud.

131
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,600
I embroidered you a strange cloud.

132
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:50,600
Xi'en has tried to punish to understand how you greatly improve your love of me,

133
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,600
I will never forget you.

134
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,600
I will never forget you.

135
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,600
I will never forget you.

136
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,600
I will never forget you.

137
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,600
I will never forget you.

138
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,600
I will never forget you.

139
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,600
I will never forget you.

140
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,600
I will never forget you.

141
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,600
I will never forget you.

142
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,600
I will never forget you.

143
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,600
I will never forget you.

144
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,600
I will never forget you.

145
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,600
I will never forget you.

146
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,600
I will never forget you.

147
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,600
I will never forget you.

148
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,600
I will never forget you.

149
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,600
I will never forget you.

150
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,600
I will never forget you.

151
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,600
I will never forget you.

152
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,600
I will never forget you.

153
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,600
I will never forget you.

154
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,600
I will never forget you.

155
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,600
I will never forget you.

156
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,600
I will never forget you.

157
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,600
I will never forget you.

158
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,600
I will never forget you.

159
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,600
I will never forget you.

160
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,600
I will never forget you.
