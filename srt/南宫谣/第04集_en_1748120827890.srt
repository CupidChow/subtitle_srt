1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,480
And to lose all the peace and nearness or to dream

2
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:42,000
Episode 17

3
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:45,600
Master,

4
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:46,680
Miss Nan De,

5
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:50,340
have arops of poison from the arrow of five year

6
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:52,840
lucky you took away the 몰�ane venom from South Jiang

7
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:53,800
it's anlerd in your life

8
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:55,600
and it really doesn't move you anymore

9
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:57,360
I'm worried for no good

10
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,240
What to do with that?

11
00:00:59,240 --> 00:00:59,740
Stop.

12
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:02,100
You're going to die in the East Sea.

13
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:03,020
What do you know?

14
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:04,420
I think you're just a mouth.

15
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,020
Actually, you can't let go of it.

16
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:07,700
Nangongying,

17
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:09,620
you're a man of the past.

18
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:12,500
Why do you want to marry Pei Xian?

19
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:14,900
You're still a child.

20
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:22,220
Father,

21
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:24,220
General Pei Xiao is a pure and pure person.

22
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:25,220
He's a impulsive person.

23
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:27,020
Don't tell him the truth.

24
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:28,540
You have to find the time

25
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:29,700
to find Cheng'er's prescription.

26
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:31,580
Where can I put the prescription?

27
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:39,100
Master,

28
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:40,780
the Ministry of Revenue

29
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:42,580
has also been dragged by the Nangong King.

30
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:44,540
The news from the palace

31
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:45,700
still hasn't been

32
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:48,380
heard from Nangongying.

33
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:51,860
It seems

34
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:54,100
that the cat is playing outside.

35
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:57,100
I forgot who the master is.

36
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:58,620
What do you mean?

37
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:26,100
It's you.

38
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:27,860
Otherwise, who do you want?

39
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:36,740
Since the wound hasn't healed yet, be careful.

40
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:40,340
Who sent this medicine?

41
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:44,220
Master Gu Yu sent it to me just now.

42
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:45,540
Gu Yu?

43
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:47,740
He's a rough person.

44
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:49,100
What good medicine can he have?

45
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:51,220
Take it.

46
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:53,500
His Majesty has such a good medicine.

47
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:54,900
You'd better keep it for yourself.

48
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:57,820
I'll let you use it.

49
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:00,220
Cut the crap.

50
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:05,700
Is your wound better?

51
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:06,900
It's just an old wound.

52
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:09,220
You can take care of it yourself.

53
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:11,220
You have to take care of the old wound.

54
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:13,660
You care about me.

55
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:15,420
Since you care about me so much,

56
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:18,420
then come and be sure.

57
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:22,940
What?

58
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:25,220
You don't even want to give me a kiss?

59
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:27,780
Or do you mean you care about me?

60
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:31,900
Look at my precious treasure.

61
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:33,700
My mother gave it to me.

62
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:35,140
It's the treasure of the world.

63
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:36,660
It's a lotus-shaped shoe.

64
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:40,140
This is the best gift

65
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:42,060
that my mother gave me.

66
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:45,980
We put them together.

67
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:47,780
You're the one who has me.

68
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:49,260
I have you.

69
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:54,020
The one who wore the beautiful moment

70
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:56,460
and the white�'s color,

71
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:59,780
his mother's tricky fortune,

72
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:01,420
ு

73
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:03,420
Immortal jade,

74
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:04,420
you're not like me.

75
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:05,260
Families,

76
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:07,040
you are the one who has many Wetland 快

77
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,160
how can you be nice to me?

78
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:11,660
All your relationships

79
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:12,700
were Давай que.

80
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:14,460
I mean that no matter how much I care,

81
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:15,340
what matters most that Heisen000 is to us.

82
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:17,780
It brings any happiness to them.

83
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:19,420
You want so as well.

84
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:20,500
I love you, Photo.

85
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:24,500
I know, I know I'm cheating

86
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,760
But all the others go in the wrong way

87
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:30,100
Dare think that I'm cheating

88
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,800
Your highness, you're afraid of renown

89
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,620
But regret the dense flash

90
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:49,000
Your highness

91
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I will give you a big gift.

92
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
You wait here for my order.

93
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Ok.

94
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
This face is really beautiful.

95
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
No wonder General Pei and His Majesty are so fond of you.

96
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I will destroy your face first.

97
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Then I will close my eyes and nose.

98
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
What exactly do you want to do?

99
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I know you can't leave a man.

100
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I specially gave you a big gift.

101
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
He is a famous doctor in the capital.

102
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I guarantee you will be satisfied.

103
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Why are you laughing?

104
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I am laughing at you, stupid girl.

105
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,000
The more you do this, the more you can't get the position of empress.

106
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Am I a childhood friend of His Majesty?

107
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I know him best.

108
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:06,000
His Majesty is the one who loves you the most.

109
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Your Majesty, the imperial guards are in a hurry.

110
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
The imperial guards are in a hurry.

111
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
The people are talking about the situation.

112
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Please let His Majesty take the position of empress.

113
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
And let the imperial guards know.

114
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
My love,

115
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I think you are more capable than I am.

116
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
You dare to interfere with my personal affairs.

117
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
There is no personal affairs in the world.

118
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Please think about it.

119
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
You don't care about the Ministry of Revenue.

120
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
You don't care about the imperial guards.

121
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
You are a minister of the Ministry of Revenue.

122
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
You are just staring at my inner court.

123
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I think you should be the emperor.

124
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
No, Your Majesty.

125
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I dare not.

126
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
The Ministry of Revenue is heartless.

127
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
The money is lost.

128
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Take out the money and pay 30 yuan.

129
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Yes.

130
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
This face is so beautiful.

131
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
If I draw your face, can you be the empress?

132
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I also prepared a gift for you.

133
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I promise to make you satisfied.

134
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Master, Princess Anyang went to Miss Nan Gong.

135
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
She went to Bian.

136
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Why did she go to the capital?

137
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
She also...

138
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
She also brought a dead ball.

139
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Dead ball?

140
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Master.

141
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I can only let the master know that

142
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
the man who is in trouble is Miss Nan Gong.

143
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Come out.

144
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
My lady.

145
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Shen Zhiwei.

146
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Can you feel the taste of the spirit?

147
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Don't use the hand of the third man again next time.

148
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I can't do it.

149
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I have to leave here as soon as possible

150
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
to find the antidote for Chao'er.

151
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Nan Gongying, stop it.

152
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Nan Gongying humiliated Princess Anyang.

153
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
She is now a criminal.

154
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Please punish her as a victim of the Hanzhang Palace.

155
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Finally, you can leave.

156
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I will go to the capital.

157
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I will go to the capital.

158
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I will go to the capital.

159
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
I will go to the capital.

160
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I will go to the capital.

161
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I will go to the capital.

162
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000

I will go to the capital.

166
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I will go to the capital.

167
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I will go to the capital.

168
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I will go to the capital.

I will go to the capital.

174
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I will go to the capital.

175
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I will go to the capital.

176
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000

I will go to the capital.

183
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I will go to the capital.

184
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I will go to the capital.

185
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I will go to the capital.

186
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I will go to the capital.

187
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I will go to the capital.
