1
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,320
Haven't you been feeling

2
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:40,720
any stagnation in your energy flow lately?

3
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:44,700
Don't look at me like that.

4
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:47,340
These are the rules of the secret guards.

5
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,960
But if you help me kill my brother.

6
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:58,400
No need.

7
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:01,420
Your Highness.

8
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:47,520
Good.

9
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,970
We've got the city defense map.

10
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:51,420
Our plan will succeed.

11
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:52,640
What plan?

12
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,080
You'll find out soon enough.

13
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:54,610
Let's go.

14
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:02,410
This.

15
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,680
The Inseparable Heroes,

16
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,680
surrender now.

17
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:15,880
Lord Chang,

18
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:19,060
according to Article 40 of the Dacheng Code,

19
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:21,840
you're guilty of treason and collusion with the enemy.

20
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:22,800
I, Chen Yiqu,

21
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,200
am ordered to

22
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,820
take you into custody.

23
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,280
Chen Yiqu,

24
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,200
your Dacheng laws

25
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,940
have no authority over me.

26
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,560
Fire!

27
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,120
Xing Dezheng.

28
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:11,680
You slaughtered the wild geese and deliberately went off the grid.

29
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,840
I was planning

30
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,400
to kill you once

31
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,900
I got the city defense map.

32
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,060
Unexpectedly.

33
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:18,520
In the end,

34
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:21,120
you still gave me a helping hand.

35
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:24,570
I was just momentarily possessed by madness.

36
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,600
Today.

37
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,000
One of us

38
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:29,280
must make it out alive.

39
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:34,040
Remember.

40
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,820
Deliver this map to the Young Prince.

41
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,880
He has already made arrangements with General Natulu.

42
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:40,680
The success of

43
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
our Great Cloud in

44
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,320
this battle

45
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,840
depends on this one move.

46
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:45,640
Young Prince

47
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:46,760
Zhao Kuo.

48
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,240
Don't you want to know

49
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:05,200
who the other member of the Inseparable Duo is?

50
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,140
Since you're willing to tell me all this,

51
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,770
you must want something in return.

52
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:19,960
I don't ask for much,

53
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,080
spare my life,

54
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,740
and I'll help you find him.

55
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:26,000
Xing Dezheng,

56
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,240
that's asking too much.

57
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,320
Your crimes

58
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:33,280
are enough to execute you ten times over.

59
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,210
I'm just trying to negotiate here.

60
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,900
Let me tell you one more thing.

61
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:39,760
That person and I

62
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:42,360
were both contacted separately by Master Helawa,

63
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:44,560
we know of each other but have never met.

64
00:05:45,159 --> 00:05:46,159
So what do you say?

65
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:48,610
Will you spare me for a chance at survival?

66
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:51,780
Or we can all go to the underworld one after another.

67
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,240
I can spare your life,

68
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,240
but I can't let you go.

69
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:58,960
How is that acceptable?

70
00:05:58,960 --> 00:05:59,620
My life here

71
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:00,800
is worse than death.

72
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,000
How can I help you all?

73
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,000
Don't worry,

74
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:06,810
someone will take you out of here eventually.

75
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:17,560
Xing Dezheng, you traitor!

76
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,240
I, Xing Dezheng, am atoning for my crimes

77
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,570
by helping you kill Die.

78
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,760
Can I live now?

79
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,440
Chang Wuming just told me

80
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,240
that Zhao Kuo used this city defense map

81
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,170
to make a deal with General Natulu.

82
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,840
Zhao Kuo was actually adopted by the Prince of Luling.

83
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:45,000
My subordinates have been disrespectful to him,

84
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,159
so it's understandable that he feels resentful.

85
00:06:47,159 --> 00:06:48,440
But I don't understand.

86
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:49,900
Why did he betray Dacheng?

87
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,659
That's beyond my control.

88
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,610
I'm leaving for Nanzhou tomorrow,

89
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,920
to a place where Yun Kingdom can't reach.

90
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,440
The scenery there is beautiful,

91
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,970
perfect for my retirement.

92
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,640
With that personality of yours.

93
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:02,970
Mind your own business.

94
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:03,840
What?

95
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,080
Are you really going to marry her?

96
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,240
Then I'll have to go find little Yangtao.

97
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,120
Don't rush.

98
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,980
Once I gather evidence of Zhao Kuo's treason

99
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,680
and resolve the crisis in Lin'an,

100
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,160
I will petition His Majesty

101
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,290
to revoke his order.

102
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,240
That flute sound is so familiar.

103
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:25,760
Yes,

104
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,040
Yangtao.

105
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:35,690
Why are you here?

106
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:43,040
Are you

107
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,140
not angry with me anymore?

108
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,159
Watch out!

109
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:56,159
Chief!

110
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:02,410
Yangtao!

111
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,160
Yangtao, wake up!

112
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:06,170
It's the mind-control poison!

113
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:06,800
The flute!

114
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:08,240
The flute!

115
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:09,280
The flute!

116
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:09,920
Li Yue'an,

117
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,280
find the source of that flute sound!

118
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:11,880
Follow me!

119
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,490
Snap out of it, Yangtao!

120
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:16,720
Wake up!

121
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:18,600
Chief!

122
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,160
Look out!

123
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:30,800
Chief!

124
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,320
Nanzhou...

125
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,559
I won't be going there after all.

126
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:41,880
Yangtao!

127
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:52,800
Yangtao!

128
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:54,730
Yangtao!

129
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,010
Yangtao!

130
00:08:58,960 --> 00:08:59,360
Old Li,

131
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:00,810
get a doctor!

132
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:02,840
Yang Tao.
