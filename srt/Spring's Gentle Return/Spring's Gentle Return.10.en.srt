1
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:49,800
Are you okay?

2
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:52,120
I'm fine.

3
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:55,300
Go back and treat the guys to something nice.

4
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:56,330
Does it hurt?

5
00:00:58,600 --> 00:00:59,460
No, it doesn't.

6
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:00,890
Are you alright?

7
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:02,280
Your well-being matters more.

8
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:02,920
I'm fine.

9
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Look at your hand.

10
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:11,400
I don't know what happened between you two before,

11
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,640
but Ququ has had amnesia for over four years now,

12
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:14,560
I have to remind you.

13
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:15,039
You...

14
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:17,480
He's definitely not that young master you mentioned,

15
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:19,440
so please stop bothering them.

16
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:24,900
This is none of your business.

17
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:25,800
Next time.

18
00:01:26,039 --> 00:01:27,300
Take care of yourself.

19
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:28,880
I understand.

20
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,320
You too.

21
00:01:32,039 --> 00:01:32,520
Boss.

22
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:33,680
Look at those two,

23
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:35,360
something's definitely going on.

24
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,289
Exactly! They're so lovey-dovey,

25
00:01:37,479 --> 00:01:39,520
doesn't look like they're getting divorced at all.

26
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,640
What are you two doing? Go inside and help,

27
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:42,280
hurry up,

28
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,220
get moving!

29
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:46,240
Cai Zhisheng

30
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,720
and his wife

31
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,280
are both deceased.

32
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:52,370
If they really were the Inseparable Hero Couple,

33
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,400
does that clear our suspicion?

34
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:59,500
Hou Wei is still searching the house,

35
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:01,480
but something feels off to me.

36
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:03,720
Indeed,

37
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,400
although I also feel something's wrong,

38
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,730
but he doesn't seem like

39
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,160
an enemy spy.

40
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:10,370
I think he...

41
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,040
He's caused you all this trouble,

42
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,560
and you're still defending him?

43
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:16,040
If spies could be identified just by looking,

44
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,840
what would be the point of my job?

45
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:20,680
These were just confiscated from his home:

46
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,400
letters to the enemy,

47
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,480
city maps,

48
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,320
a Cloud Kingdom token and this border pass.

49
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:30,100
We'll continue searching for his accomplices.

50
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,360
As for all of you,

51
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,560
those with merits will be rewarded,

52
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:36,000
those with guilt will be sentenced accordingly.

53
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:36,530
Alright,

54
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:37,920
everyone go get some rest,

55
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:38,579
move along.

56
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,620
Thank you for your hard work, sir.

57
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,079
Let's go.

58
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:47,520
Let's go home.

59
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,960
If you put the Young Master in danger again,

60
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:06,640
I won't let you off.

61
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:07,320
Princess,

62
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,130
if you have any grievances,

63
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,160
direct them at me.

64
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:15,540
Cricket, you go ahead with your work.

65
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,460
Take care of yourself.

66
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,400
I'll wait for you at home.

67
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:26,920
Princess,

68
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:29,800
why torment yourself like this?

69
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:30,600
Young Master.

70
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,600
Chen Yiqu.

71
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:36,880
I'm sorry.

72
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:39,370
I've been quite abrupt lately.

73
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,610
I just learned about your memory loss.

74
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:43,680
Yue'an,

75
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,900
Zhao Jian is already dead.

76
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:49,600
I am Chen Yiqu now.

77
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:51,600
Young Master.

78
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,520
I'm already married, Princess.

79
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,400
Married.

80
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,090
What about our engagement?

81
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:04,320
You promised we would marry after the northern expedition.

82
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:06,720
I've been searching for you for four years.

83
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:09,290
The Emperor arranged our marriage for

84
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:12,920
whoever inherited the title of Prince of Luling.

85
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,960
Someone else sits on that throne now,

86
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:15,600
not me.

87
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,240
For these four years,

88
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:20,800
I'm sorry.

89
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,810
What exactly happened four years ago?

90
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,440
Autumn osmanthus

91
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,210
and miles of lotus flowers.

92
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,260
Raise an army of a million men,

93
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,250
and make your stand at Wu Mountain.

94
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,680
That day I used the password

95
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:32,600
to infiltrate the enemy camp,

96
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,800
took Helawu's head,

97
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,680
and planned to return immediately to regroup with you,

98
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:38,080
but unexpectedly, a person in black appeared on my way

99
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,210
and blocked my path.

100
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,200
This person and I

101
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:13,000
were evenly matched.

102
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,490
I seized the opportunity to wound her,

103
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:18,700
but to my surprise,

104
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,480
she had reinforcements.

105
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,810
They not only took the head,

106
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,460
but also knocked me off the cliff.

107
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,360
When I woke up again,

108
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:49,560
I found myself lying in a farmer's home, the Chen family.

109
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,890
I had lost my memory then

110
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,650
and suffered a head injury.

111
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,320
They

112
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,740
named me Chen Yiqu.

113
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,600
Since you've remembered everything now,

114
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,600
come back with me to the Luling Army.

115
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,770
I'm not some young master anymore,

116
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,120
I'm just an ordinary person.

117
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,120
I will report to the Emperor to restore your status.

118
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:05,600
Enough.

119
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:07,680
Now I

120
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,960
only want to be with Yangtao.

121
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,840
A mere country woman.

122
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:13,440
Her?

123
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:14,810
On what grounds?

124
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,040
In terms of martial skills,

125
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:16,920
family background,

126
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:17,440
appearance...

127
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:17,900
Enough!

128
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:23,840
I love her.

129
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,520
Only she brings me peace.

130
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,240
For the rest of my life,

131
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,500
I just want to live a simple life with her.

132
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:36,290
What about the Luling Army?

133
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,880
Are you abandoning them?

134
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,659
These past four years,

135
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,740
although I lost my memory,

136
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:45,360
I've heard about the achievements of the Luling Army,

137
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,960
all their accomplishments.

138
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,720
Your military achievements are outstanding,

139
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,159
the Luling Army is better off

140
00:07:50,159 --> 00:07:51,360
with you than with me.

141
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:53,960
Thank you

142
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,080
for your help today.

143
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:58,320
Farewell.

144
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,400
Young Master.

145
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:12,400
Zhang.

146
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:13,560
Get some rest.

147
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,600
You hugged her.

148
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,160
No.

149
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,680
I pushed her away.

150
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,960
You also held her hand.

151
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:37,559
No,

152
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:39,320
she grabbed my hand,

153
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,820
I was the one being pulled.

154
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:43,440
Young Master,

155
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,200
how could you abandon us?

156
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:47,560
What will we do without you?

157
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:53,560
I was wrong.

158
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,770
Looks like we won't be having wonton soup,

159
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,660
not as good as fancy meat dishes, huh?

160
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:08,280
I'm sorry, I'm truly sorry, my dear.

161
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,800
What did you do wrong?

162
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:11,600
I don't know,

163
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,740
but I must have done something wrong.

164
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:14,720
Young Master,

165
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:15,880
please get up,

166
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,000
I can't bear you bowing to me like this.

167
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:18,320
No,

168
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:19,760
what are you doing?

169
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,320
Please come inside

170
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,160
Young Master.

171
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,160
I hope you'll still find

172
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,400
our humble abode comfortable.

173
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,160
My dear.

174
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:30,880
My dear.

175
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:33,880
My dear.

176
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,280
Since we've just

177
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:37,140
returned home,

178
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,120
shouldn't we

179
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:38,960
clean up a bit?

180
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,140
Away with bad luck!

181
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:41,490
I'll go prepare.

182
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:43,520
Tell me honestly,

183
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,370
how long have you had your memory back?

184
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:51,520
Well,

185
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:52,560
I just

186
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,080
hit my head, didn't I?

187
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,240
I had a moment of clarity,

188
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,000
and then

189
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,760
I gradually started remembering things.

190
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,440
So, Young Master,

191
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:06,120
is there anything else you haven't told a commoner like me?

192
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:06,480
No,

193
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:07,690
absolutely not.

194
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:18,860
I have no farmland,

195
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:20,960
my properties have all been confiscated,

196
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:23,020
I don't even have any secret savings.

197
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,700
Please stop calling me Young Master.

198
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,760
What about the Princess?

199
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,920
I was removed from the family register

200
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,850
when I disappeared four years ago.

201
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,250
She's going to marry

202
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:40,760
my brother, Zhao Kuo.

203
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:42,520
Yangtao,

204
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,400
you're the only wife I'll ever have.

205
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,720
I was thinking,

206
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:55,520
if you married into the Princess's household,

207
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:57,520
it might not be so bad.

208
00:10:58,680 --> 00:10:59,640
If I had known

209
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,680
you were this open-minded back then,

210
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:02,610
I should have...

211
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:04,120
You should have what?

212
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,040
Yangtao.

213
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:33,920
I love you.

214
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:38,090
What did you say?

215
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:39,360
I said...

216
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:49,960
What did you just say?

217
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,320
Say it again.

218
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,120
I said,

219
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:56,760
I...
