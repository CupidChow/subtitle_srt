1
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,060
You're quite amusing, young master.

2
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:42,040
You don't have any martial skills

3
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:43,640
yet you still try to show off.

4
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:46,340
Is there something wrong with your head?

5
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:48,960
I

6
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,260
truly do suffer from a brain ailment.

7
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,000
But as men of Dacheng,

8
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:56,800
whether we have brain problems or not,

9
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,440
when we encounter such despicable matters,

10
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:00,700
we cannot simply stand by and do nothing.

11
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:05,400
I am Chen Yiqu.

12
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:07,760
Thank you for your help earlier.

13
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,820
You were the one who acted bravely first,

14
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:12,570
and even got hurt because of me.

15
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:15,850
Let me take a look at your wound.

16
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:49,880
Time flies,

17
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,570
it's been three years already.

18
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:56,039
I once aspired to be a wandering doctor, free from all constraints,

19
00:01:56,039 --> 00:01:58,770
never imagining I'd settle down with my own shop.

20
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:02,320
I originally just wanted to find a way to recover my memories,

21
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,850
to remember who I really am.

22
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,530
But before I knew it,

23
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,340
I had started a family.

24
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:08,850
Do you regret it?

25
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,060
I have at times.

26
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,000
But...

27
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,960
Surveillance Bureau! Official business!

28
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,120
Inseparable Heroes,

29
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,520
surrender immediately!

30
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:25,380
Don't move!

31
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:27,010
Put your hands on the table!

32
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:28,920
Fine.

33
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,320
Officers,

34
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:35,140
I work for the government too.

35
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,920
I can't believe spies like you

36
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:39,240
managed to infiltrate official positions.

37
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,400
What spies?

38
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:44,079
Wait, what are you doing?

39
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,620
This is evidence of your treason.

40
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:48,520
Chen Yiqu,

41
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,520
what have you done?

42
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,920
I haven't done anything,

43
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,360
don't make false accusations!

44
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,960
Treason is punishable by death,

45
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,400
don't frame innocent people!

46
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,480
In your Cloud Nation, it might just be beheading,

47
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,740
but in our Great Cheng,

48
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:02,320
treason is usually punished by dismemberment,

49
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:04,520
which means being cut into pieces while still alive.

50
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,720
Inseparable Heroes.

51
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:10,400
Misunderstanding.

52
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,480
Misunderstanding.

53
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:13,400
They think we're the Inseparable Heroes, but

54
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,600
we're not.

55
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:15,770
Behave yourselves,

56
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:17,680
you spies.

57
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,040
How come you both say the same thing?

58
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,100
You two have hidden yourselves well,

59
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,680
our Surveillance Bureau has been watching for years

60
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,680
just to discover the codename 'Inseparable Heroes.'

61
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:29,560
If we hadn't accidentally found your handler moved to Lin'an,

62
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,820
we wouldn't have caught you red-handed.

63
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:35,480
We really aren't the Inseparable Heroes.

64
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:37,440
Then let's see

65
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:38,810
what this letter

66
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,400
actually says.

67
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:43,079
There's no need to look at it,

68
00:03:43,079 --> 00:03:43,520
right?

69
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:44,280
No,

70
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,400
that's not it.

71
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:46,240
You can't read it.

72
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:46,900
Stay still.

73
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,880
Resolve grudges, let go of attachments.

74
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:54,680
Let's not discuss this further.

75
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:58,770
These thieves have become quite sophisticated.

76
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,440
They even managed to hide treasonous correspondence in divorce papers.

77
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:04,080
Must be using some kind of code.

78
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:04,960
When we get back to the office,

79
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:07,090
we'll let those old experts decode it.

80
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,000
Chen Yiqu.

81
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:12,240
You actually want a divorce from me?

82
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:14,400
I told you it wasn't me. Don't you believe me?

83
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,130
Love letter.

84
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:19,120
Look.

85
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,680
See for yourself,

86
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:24,120
what else could this be but divorce papers?

87
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,480
What are you doing?

88
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,280
Sit back down!

89
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:31,080
So what if it's divorce papers?

90
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,480
Let me tell you, Yang Tao,

91
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:34,360
I, Chen Yiqu,

92
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,360
am going to be a dignified man today,

93
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,480
and I absolutely won't let you, you tigress,

94
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:38,880
Go on.

95
00:04:39,159 --> 00:04:40,159
bully me anymore.

96
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,159
Chen Yiqu, are you trying to rebel?

97
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:44,820
Both of you.

98
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:46,220
Sit back down, now!

99
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:46,640
Trying to rebel?

100
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:47,280
Is that what you want?

101
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,080
Just kill me then!

102
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,280
You have a death wish?

103
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,320
Both of you behave yourselves!

104
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,450
Or I'll execute you right here and now!

105
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,980
What are you waiting for? Run!

106
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,010
Xiaowei!

107
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:09,720
Don't worry about me!

108
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:32,920
Who are you?

109
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,400
Yang Tao, wait.

110
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,120
Wait for what?

111
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,200
Yang Tao is coming back.

112
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:42,800
Don't run!

113
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:44,820
What are you doing?

114
00:05:45,159 --> 00:05:47,690
If you don't run, are you waiting to be caught?

115
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,640
If both of us believe we're innocent,

116
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:50,840
we should go back now.

117
00:05:51,159 --> 00:05:52,400
If before I lost my memory,

118
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,640
I was truly a spy,

119
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,420
then I deserve to be arrested.

120
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:57,960
But I believe they will give us justice.

121
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,040
Come back!

122
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,960
Don't you understand Hou Wei's methods?

123
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,680
They'll only force confessions through torture.

124
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,000
By then, not only will you lose your innocence,

125
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,600
everyone connected to you will be implicated.

126
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,640
Since you saw that divorce letter earlier,

127
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,460
we are no longer husband and wife.

128
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:17,920
From now on,

129
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,760
we have no relationship whatsoever.

130
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,080
From now on, I, Chen Yiqu,

131
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:23,120
will take responsibility for everything I do

132
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:23,880
by myself,

133
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,330
so don't interfere.

134
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,040
Chen Yiqu!

135
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,520
I'm sorry.

136
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:48,690
I apologize.

137
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,520
The person is already dead.

138
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,920
What are you looking for?

139
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:55,800
Are you crazy?

140
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,240
Why did you come back?

141
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,450
The blade was swift,

142
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:03,280
killing with a single strike.

143
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,600
The imperial guards are skilled fighters,

144
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,460
but this killer

145
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:08,500
is far more formidable than them.

146
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:10,840
Is this really the time to discuss this?

147
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,560
You were never here today.

148
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,560
I've never seen you,

149
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,420
now go quickly.

150
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:16,960
Divorce papers.

151
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:19,440
It must be officially registered with the authorities

152
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,680
Verbal agreements mean nothing

153
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22,210
and neither does your word.

154
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:27,020
I just don't want to be dragged down with you.

155
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:29,240
Autopsy.

156
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,010
Disgusting.

157
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:41,480
This wound

158
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,289
is about 20 inches long.

159
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,530
It was made by a blade

160
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,520
that's thin at the edge but thick at the spine

161
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:48,850
which pierced straight through the body.

162
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,570
But such weapons are common

163
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,220
unless we can find an exact match.

164
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,050
This wound pattern seems rather unusual.

165
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,000
That's right.

166
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:08,040
The wound runs diagonally from the lower left to the upper right.

167
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,220
This indicates

168
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:13,060
that the killer was holding the knife with their left hand.

169
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,120
Yes.

170
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:17,440
The killer

171
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,410
is left-handed.

172
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:27,700
Sir.

173
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:28,320
Everyone,

174
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,520
guard the front and back doors.

175
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:30,520
Lao Li, Shaobing,

176
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:31,160
come upstairs with me.

177
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:31,720
Yes,

178
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:32,240
sir.

179
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:34,480
What should we do?

180
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,120
Chief,

181
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,410
where are you going?

182
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:43,800
Let's go.

183
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,960
Chen Yiqu, don't make me hit you.

184
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,130
Hurry up.

185
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:49,960
It's quite high.

186
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,620
Surveillance Bureau.

187
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,480
Now we're in big trouble.

188
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:06,810
Boss.

189
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:07,800
What kind of person

190
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,440
would dare kill an imperial guard?

191
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:09,840
Li,

192
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,420
go get the coroner.

193
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:20,120
Shaobing,

194
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,900
bring the innkeeper and the waiter here.

195
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:48,760
Hurry up,

196
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,360
gather all the valuables.

197
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:52,020
Someone's trying to frame us.

198
00:10:58,640 --> 00:10:59,320
This way.

199
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:10,120
Boss.

200
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,660
This place is so small,

201
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,280
looks like they've already fled.

202
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,010
Search again

203
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,200
for any clues.

204
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:15,600
Yes, sir.
