1
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:38,700
Rock Paper Scissors King.

2
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:52,810
Rock, paper, scissors.

3
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:23,240
I'm sorry for the trouble,

4
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:25,700
having to investigate while you're unwell.

5
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:26,600
Young Master,

6
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:27,640
it's fine.

7
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:31,560
Such an incident occurring in my jurisdiction

8
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,039
is already my oversight.

9
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:36,320
If I can help you

10
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,640
catch these Twin Heroes,

11
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,120
it would actually

12
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,500
make up for my mistake.

13
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:43,880
Previously,

14
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:46,520
the Princess sent me a confidential letter

15
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:47,979
asking me to investigate.

16
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,000
The investigation into

17
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,400
the evidence provided by Cai Zhisheng's butler Ye

18
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,680
has not confirmed

19
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:04,360
Cai Zhisheng's innocence.

20
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:07,410
Xing Dezheng, whom you suspected,

21
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:09,560
is not a suspect.

22
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,740
That makes things difficult.

23
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:14,800
Yes,

24
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,560
it's truly a challenge.

25
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:27,360
Boss.

26
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:28,840
Chen Yiqu has failed.

27
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,240
He hasn't found any leads,

28
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:30,600
and

29
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,460
he even suspected you before.

30
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:33,320
Right.

31
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,240
What reason is there to suspect me?

32
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,040
I have no idea.

33
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,320
Seems like he couldn't find evidence

34
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,360
and is now desperate like a cornered animal.

35
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:41,160
They just wanted to find someone to stall for time.

36
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,120
Then aren't they

37
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:45,720
doomed?

38
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:52,940
Take these for now.

39
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:55,000
I've already reported about your reward,

40
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:55,600
and it will

41
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,079
definitely be generous.

42
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,329
Thank you, boss.

43
00:02:58,920 --> 00:02:59,980
I'll head back now.

44
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,140
Goodbye, boss.

45
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,520
You sold me out

46
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,579
for this little money?

47
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,040
Brother Chen

48
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,760
I... I...

49
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:24,200
take it easy

50
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,260
Tell me everything

51
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:26,880
truthfully,

52
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,010
if you hide anything...

53
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,800
I'll tell you,

54
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,280
I won't hide anything,

55
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,560
I swear.

56
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:50,540
Lord Chang.

57
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:54,120
Have you arranged the execution before reporting as the young prince requested?

58
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,980
We have prepared the confession.

59
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,240
I have secretly added

60
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,200
Yang Tao's name to tomorrow's execution list.

61
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,240
Once she's dead,

62
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,820
I'll have someone press her fingerprints on the document.

63
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,480
This way,

64
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,640
Zhao Jian will certainly be implicated.

65
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:12,570
The young prince

66
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,040
can rest easy.

67
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,010
That's perfect.

68
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:31,810
Yang Tao.

69
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:32,730
Yang Tao.

70
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,240
Xing.

71
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,810
I brought your favorite pastries.

72
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:39,080
Crispy puffs.

73
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,080
Honey slices.

74
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:52,720
I never thought you'd be the last person I see before I die.

75
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,740
What nonsense are you talking about?

76
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,370
Don't you have one more day?

77
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,360
Chang Wuming broke his promise,

78
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:04,570
and moved up my execution to today.

79
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,330
The imperial guards

80
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,000
will come for me soon.

81
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:11,810
What did you say?

82
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:29,960
Boss.

83
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:31,120
Boss.

84
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:34,840
I've found a lead on the Twin Heroes.

85
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,240
What lead?

86
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:37,640
Do you have any idea?

87
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:39,170
I've been thinking lately,

88
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:40,480
why

89
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,840
we've been constantly outsmarted by the Twin Heroes.

90
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:44,400
Why

91
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:46,640
can't we find even a single trace of them?

92
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:47,280
Could it be

93
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,340
they have an insider at court?

94
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,120
Why? Why?

95
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,420
There aren't so many whys.

96
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,320
Haven't you considered that

97
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,440
these Twin Heroes

98
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,409
are constantly hunted and hiding,

99
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:00,700
they're tired,

100
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,680
and maybe they just want to quit?

101
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,080
That's possible.

102
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,480
But we've all forgotten that

103
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,260
as long as a person exists,

104
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:10,210
they will leave traces behind,

105
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,160
we've just overlooked them.

106
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,200
What traces?

107
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:18,400
Someone who grew up in Cloud Nation

108
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:22,740
will definitely have characteristics from there.

109
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,280
If we find suspicious individuals,

110
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,520
investigate their background,

111
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,420
and financial transactions,

112
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,340
we'll definitely catch them.

113
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,880
Even if this person has powerful connections

114
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,540
and can destroy all evidence,

115
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,010
there will still be records

116
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,360
in Cloud Nation.

117
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:45,400
Boss,

118
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:46,940
take a look at this.

119
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:48,600
These fireworks

120
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,940
are the signal Wild Goose uses to contact all their agents.

121
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
And this firework

122
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:57,159
was specifically left for me by Butcher Zhang.

123
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,730
You want to follow the trail

124
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:00,890
to find the Twin Heroes?

125
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,960
Not just the Twin Heroes,

126
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:07,360
I can also use Cloud Nation's unique characteristics

127
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,360
to round up all the agents in Dacheng

128
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,560
in one fell swoop.

129
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:13,690
Let's go.

130
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:24,600
Hey.

131
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:25,920
This is a dead end,

132
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,440
did you take a wrong turn?

133
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:27,680
No.

134
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,660
We just need to climb over.

135
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:31,640
Right.

136
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:31,960
Hey.

137
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,320
You just mentioned

138
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,920
what are those Cloud Nation characteristics?

139
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,250
Cloud Nation people...

140
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,420
These people from Yun Kingdom...

141
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,460
Ear piercings.

142
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:45,680
People from Yun Kingdom

143
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,360
love getting piercings from childhood.

144
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:47,880
They

145
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,840
determine social status by the number of earrings.

146
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,500
Most have three pairs or more.

147
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,860
But most importantly,

148
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
the clue provided by Wolf Thirteen.

149
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:56,600
He said

150
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:59,720
the real Inseparable Heroes

151
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:02,700
are right here in our government office.

152
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:10,300
When did you start suspecting me?

153
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,340
Left-handed with a knife.

154
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:14,840
It really is you.

155
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,200
Cricket.

156
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,960
I've spared you many times already.

157
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,120
Why?

158
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,360
Why won't you just leave me alone?

159
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:37,419
You asked when I started suspecting you.

160
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:38,720
First,

161
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:42,049
you killed those two guards at Hele Tower.

162
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,520
You wanted to frame us

163
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:45,360
so that after we fled,

164
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,140
no one would ever suspect you.

165
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:48,280
Second,

166
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,560
you took our divorce papers.

167
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,360
But you never expected

168
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,330
we would come back to prove our innocence.

169
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:56,410
Finally,

170
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:00,200
that night when we escaped from prison to your house.

171
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,130
You had just left

172
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,520
when Wolf came to kill us.

173
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:05,240
I believe

174
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,220
Wolf was trying to kill

175
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,200
the real Inseparable Heroes, wasn't he?
