1
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:38,680
Autumn osmanthus

2
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:40,410
and miles of lotus flowers.

3
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:43,720
The first part of the password is

4
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:46,120
'Autumn osmanthus and miles of lotus flowers,'

5
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:47,120
and the second part is

6
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,580
'Raise a million troops, stand at Mount Wu.'

7
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,450
Raise a million troops.

8
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:59,120
Stand at Mount Wu.

9
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:09,800
Jin Wutu

10
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,860
pays respects to the Twin Heroes.

11
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,000
I've caused both of you to be exposed,

12
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:25,660
and deserve

13
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:26,680
a thousand deaths for my fault.

14
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:27,480
It's alright,

15
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:28,400
but

16
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:31,240
there are Dacheng soldiers everywhere outside.

17
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:32,320
Why did you summon us?

18
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:33,320
What's the matter?

19
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:34,250
Get to the point.

20
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:35,940
Your superior,

21
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:36,880
Lord Helawo,

22
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:38,440
was executed due to clan disputes

23
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:39,840
within the royal family.

24
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:40,759
But before his death,

25
00:01:40,759 --> 00:01:42,759
he didn't reveal how to contact you.

26
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,680
His Majesty has been planning a southern campaign recently.

27
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:47,940
But all the agents sent

28
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,729
have vanished without a trace.

29
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,720
The higher-ups had no choice but to wake me up,

30
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,920
and then gave me all the previous correspondence

31
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:55,920
between you two and Master Helawa,

32
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,380
so I could search for clues

33
00:01:57,479 --> 00:01:59,000
to reestablish contact with both of you.

34
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,730
So where are those letters now?

35
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,740
Did you keep them safe?

36
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:06,490
Don't worry.

37
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,889
The moment we made contact,

38
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,479
I burned them all.

39
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:14,200
Good thinking.

40
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,240
Safe,

41
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,160
completely safe now.

42
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,320
Is there any possibility

43
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,840
that you might have missed some clues?

44
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:25,650
I almost forgot,

45
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:29,570
I still have the note you sent with your messenger the other day.

46
00:02:35,079 --> 00:02:35,680
This thing

47
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,770
must not fall into Hou Wei's hands.

48
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,000
Burn it,

49
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:43,050
and there will be no trace left to prove your identities.

50
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:55,320
Everyone,

51
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,000
surround this place,

52
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,560
don't let anyone escape.

53
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:05,480
Don't be afraid,

54
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:07,000
I've long expected this day would come.

55
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,260
Both of you, follow me.

56
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,120
Take this.

57
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:13,980
What are you doing?

58
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:16,940
Sprinkle more over there.

59
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:23,720
Don't be afraid.

60
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:24,760
Those guards who were watching me

61
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:25,360
have been dealt with,

62
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,200
had nowhere to put them,

63
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:28,200
so I made them keep me company in bed.

64
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:40,420
Being watched all these days, this is our only hope.

65
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:41,400
Aren't you coming?

66
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,800
Someone needs to cover for you.

67
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:43,840
If the three of us leave together now,

68
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,370
we can all escape together.

69
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:48,880
You're safe now.

70
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,320
Use this to contact Dayan.

71
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:52,720
The great cause of Dayun now depends on you.

72
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,560
Go now!

73
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,410
Keep running. Don't look back.

74
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,360
White mountains.

75
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:10,880
Black soil.

76
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,360
I, Jin Wutu,

77
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,280
have returned today.

78
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:18,560
Come on.

79
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,880
White mountains.

80
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,960
Black soil.

81
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,520
I, Jin Wutu,

82
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,120
have returned today.

83
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,159
Attack!

84
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,060
Don't just stand there! Put out the fire!

85
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,080
Get water!

86
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:53,640
Chen Yiqu,

87
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,400
tell me honestly,

88
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,640
how did you know that was a secret order from Yun Kingdom?

89
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:58,720
I don't know.

90
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:02,480
I...

91
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,730
I really don't know.

92
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,680
When he said the password just now,

93
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,600
some memories seemed to flash through my mind.

94
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,520
In these memories,

95
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,580
someone told me about this password.

96
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,240
My dear.

97
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
What if I really am one of the Jiandié Twin Heroes?

98
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:16,930
What should I do?

99
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:19,920
Then we'll keep investigating

100
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,720
until you prove your innocence.

101
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,480
If I discover you're truly a spy,

102
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,400
I'll be the first to execute you.

103
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:28,560
What's wrong?

104
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:29,780
Are you afraid?

105
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:31,520
No.

106
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,720
I'm just thinking about how we're taking such big risks,

107
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,240
running here and there,

108
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,210
without finding a single clue.

109
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,170
What's going on?

110
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:46,740
Guards!

111
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,320
Surround this place!

112
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,610
Don't be afraid.

113
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,100
Both of you, follow me.

114
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,280
Are you crazy?

115
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:10,530
Look at this.

116
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,520
See if there are any other clues.

117
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,400
Four characters.

118
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,080
Meet at Hele Tower.

119
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,500
Just four characters?

120
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,680
There are no other clues.

121
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:27,370
How's your hand?

122
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:30,440
You got burned grabbing that note, didn't you?

123
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:31,480
It doesn't hurt.

124
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,120
I practice martial arts and have iron palm skills,

125
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,580
you wouldn't understand.

126
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,760
Would it kill you to admit it hurts?

127
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:38,800
You're always like this, that's why I...

128
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:39,530
Why you what?

129
00:06:40,159 --> 00:06:41,560
Why you wanted a divorce?

130
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:43,920
No.

131
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:45,740
Let me tell you,

132
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:47,690
don't ever mention divorce again.

133
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,200
Who am I?

134
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,280
Who am I really?

135
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,180
Do you still recognize me?

136
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,930
I made you some ginseng soup. Drink it while it's hot.

137
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,860
You stayed up all night again?

138
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,210
I have a lot of medicine to prepare.

139
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,000
Drink up.

140
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:33,560
In a government office like this,

141
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:35,490
there aren't that many vacancies.

142
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:36,960
Take these pastries back.

143
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,159
Help me figure something out,

144
00:07:38,159 --> 00:07:40,020
or just squeeze him in somewhere.

145
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:41,450
This much money?

146
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:42,960
That's almost a month's salary wasted.

147
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:43,800
Cut the nonsense.

148
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,659
Just tell me if you'll help or not.

149
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,600
That husband of yours

150
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,600
can't lift a finger to help himself.

151
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,620
Then find him something easier to do.

152
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:53,480
I don't care,

153
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,560
but if you don't help me,

154
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,760
next time you and your buddies need medical help, I'll...

155
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:57,890
Listen to yourself.

156
00:07:58,159 --> 00:07:58,880
How about this,

157
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:01,520
I'll take the pastries, but you keep your money.

158
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,440
Next month, Old Yang is going home for mourning.

159
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,880
Have your husband come then.

160
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:05,800
Thanks, Xing.

161
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:11,530
How did it go?

162
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,000
It's done. Let's go home for dinner.

163
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,120
You didn't spend a penny!

164
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,480
Of course not.

165
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:17,650
That's impressive!

166
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:26,080
You have a strong personality

167
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,540
and want to heal the world.

168
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,480
I'm physically weak,

169
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,600
can't fight,

170
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:31,700
and have no memory.

171
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:33,960
I shouldn't be holding you back.

172
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:35,850
What do you mean?

173
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:39,559
Didn't you ask why I want a divorce?

174
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:41,880
Actually,

175
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:44,049
it's not your fault.

176
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:46,520
It's my problem.

177
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:47,360
Didn't you say...

178
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,490
Are we not allowed to mention divorce?

179
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,120
Is someone helping us?

180
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:06,200
Anyway,

181
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,260
we shouldn't stay here. Let's go.

182
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:25,400
Sir.

183
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,450
The beams have all burned down,

184
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:29,690
there's nothing left to investigate.

185
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,840
You're the one who's worthless,

186
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,160
Xing Dezheng.

187
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,880
Do all you government officials

188
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:38,000
slack off like you do,

189
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,680
going through the motions and waiting to die?

190
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:40,560
No, sir.

191
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,860
The men are still working inside.

192
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:43,800
Sir.

193
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:45,160
Sir.

194
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:46,160
Chief,

195
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:48,880
we found three bodies. Get them ready quickly.

196
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,360
Heaven is just!

197
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:14,440
I've finally caught these inseparable heroes in one swoop.

198
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,520
Take the bodies back to the magistrate's office.

199
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:19,580
Quickly, this way.

200
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:21,720
This way.

201
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:22,120
Hurry!

202
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:33,840
Where is Magistrate Chang?

203
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:34,640
He went back to the magistrate's office.

204
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:35,480
What's the matter?

205
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:36,240
I found this

206
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,280
in the ruins.

207
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,000
Keep this matter quiet.

208
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:46,530
Yes, sir.

209
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,130
Let's go.

210
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:51,760
Chen Yiqu.

211
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:53,640
Chen Yiqu.

212
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:55,480
Chen Yiqu.

213
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:57,320
Chen Yiqu.

214
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:58,840
Chen Yiqu.

215
00:10:58,880 --> 00:10:59,600
Where have you been?

216
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,060
I thought you were arrested by the soldiers.

217
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:07,040
You went to gather herbs.

218
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:08,690
This is Bai Lian,

219
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:10,440
you told me about it before,

220
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,560
it can treat burns.

221
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,640
Is it really Bai Lian?

222
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:17,980
Yes, it's Bai Lian.

223
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:18,860
You told me that

224
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,640
Bai Lian isn't white but green,

225
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:21,700
shaped like a palm,

226
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,640
and its leaves are very thin,

227
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:24,500
like thin paper

228
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:26,800
in texture.

229
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:33,760
Chen Yiqu,

230
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:35,720
I've told you not to eat these things carelessly.

231
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:36,600
Even though they look similar,

232
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,840
some might be dangerous,

233
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:39,700
and could make you go mad if eaten.

234
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,460
Although I don't know who sent this note,

235
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:43,720
take a closer look

236
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:46,540
at the difference between these two papers.

237
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:48,280
I can't tell.

238
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,000
This one

239
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,440
has a rough texture,

240
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,200
it's horsehair paper used by ordinary households,

241
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,480
but this one is different,

242
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,280
with a fine texture,

243
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:57,480
not easily torn and insect-resistant.

244
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,400
Say something I can understand.

245
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:00,280
This

246
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:02,480
is Yuan Book paper made by the Cai paper mill in the east district,

247
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,520
a special type of paper

248
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:04,680
that's very hard to get.

249
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:05,960
You have to buy at least 500 sheets

250
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,560
and place orders in advance.

251
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,060
Then the Cai paper mill

252
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,280
must have a purchase list.
