1
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:05,680
The Inseparable Heroes

2
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:06,680
bid you farewell.

3
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:10,840
Spare me, great hero!

4
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:11,640
I know the rules.

5
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:12,680
I didn't see anything,

6
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:13,539
nothing at all,

7
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,320
I didn't see a thing.

8
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:19,320
But you just did, didn't you?

9
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:20,580
I didn't see anything.

10
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:21,200
Shut up.

11
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:24,039
From now on, answer whatever you're asked.

12
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:27,520
Who booked

13
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:29,720
the private room last night?

14
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:34,130
I don't know.

15
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:40,080
We're not the Inseparable Duo.

16
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,800
Aren't you two the Inseparable Duo?

17
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:45,570
Your wanted posters are all over the city.

18
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:46,380
Where's the

19
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:47,560
reservation list?

20
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:48,289
Hand it over.

21
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,759
Hou Wei took it.

22
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:55,770
You must at least know what the person who made the reservation looks like, right?

23
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:57,400
Actually,

24
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,560
nobody showed up that day.

25
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,660
Keep your hands where we can see them.

26
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,360
Where's the note?

27
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:34,680
I gave it to the officers.

28
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:35,520
Keep lying.

29
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,079
I forgot. It's right here.

30
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:45,940
Why did you hide it?

31
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,800
I only gave the innkeeper ten coins.

32
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:51,940
I was afraid he'd find out, so I hid it.

33
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:54,420
What are you sniffing at, dog?

34
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:56,120
Look here,

35
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,240
this handwriting,

36
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:59,120
professional constables like us can tell.

37
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,640
I can tell from the powerful strokes

38
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:02,720
so

39
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:03,640
I'm certain

40
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,520
this was written by someone with exceptional martial arts skills.

41
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,280
Smell this.

42
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:10,850
The scent of mutton.

43
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,050
I can't smell it.

44
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,280
Is it from a Western Regions shop

45
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:16,280
or a shepherd?

46
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,920
It can't be Old Zhang, can it?

47
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,800
He spends all day with sheep

48
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,579
and reeks of that gamey smell.

49
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,440
Who is this Mr. Zhang?

50
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,970
He delivers mutton to our shop,

51
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,280
from the west side

52
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,840
of town. He's Zhang the butcher.

53
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:32,700
Take care, sir.

54
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,640
Goodbye.

55
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,760
Safe travels, sir.

56
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:40,240
Who told you to use the front door?

57
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,770
Use the back door next time.

58
00:03:48,079 --> 00:03:49,680
What could have made

59
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,800
this butcher Zhang

60
00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:54,079
forget his place?

61
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,140
Something big.

62
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,079
And it must be

63
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:02,160
something urgent enough to activate these dormant agents,

64
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,890
for him to not use the back door.

65
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,660
So do you think this butcher Zhang

66
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,200
is a handler

67
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,560
or just a messenger?

68
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,120
If he's a handler, that's way too risky.

69
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:15,250
What kind of big situation is this?

70
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,839
None of your business.

71
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:20,720
Brother,

72
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,280
where does this

73
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,040
butcher Zhang live?

74
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:26,040
I only know he's from Taiping Village,

75
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,970
but I don't know his exact address.

76
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,760
Taiping Village.

77
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,690
Thank you, brother.

78
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,120
This is for me.

79
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,620
What are you doing?

80
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,200
I already paid him.

81
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:47,680
He's helped us so much, and you still hit him.

82
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:50,520
What if he could still get some useful information?

83
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,400
This guy won't spill anything even if you beat him with a stick,

84
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,200
just like you.

85
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:53,840
Let's go.

86
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,000
Come on, let's hurry.

87
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,240
Fresh black tea here!

88
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:03,320
Boss!

89
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,580
One bowl of tea,

90
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:05,960
steeped only three times,

91
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:07,090
no fragrance added.

92
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,370
Ah, coming right up!

93
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,960
This tea came in early this year.

94
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,420
I've prepared in advance.

95
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:16,960
Fresh tea here!

96
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,620
Get your black tea,

97
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,300
cools you down in the heat!

98
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:23,040
Here, black tea!

99
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,680
Fresh black tea!

100
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,780
Black tea for sale!

101
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,500
Come have some tea!

102
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:30,780
Who goes there?

103
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:31,760
Whoa!

104
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,159
I am Princess Yuean Li of Qinye,

105
00:05:34,159 --> 00:05:35,520
heading to Lin'an on urgent business.

106
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,520
Who dares stop me?

107
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:38,920
Please be careful, Princess.

108
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,960
There are spies escaping from Lin'an.

109
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,560
That's exactly why I'm here.

110
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:54,240
Which way is Butcher Zhang's house?

111
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,040
What's wrong?

112
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,240
That fat guy drinking tea up ahead

113
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,000
is Hou Wei's lookout.

114
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:10,380
Look casual when you glance over.

115
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,580
How do you know?

116
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:13,360
We officials have our own

117
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,040
methods and protocols.

118
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:17,240
If I were watching this place,

119
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,640
I'd choose that spot too.

120
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:20,500
Good visibility, open position.

121
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:20,960
But...

122
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,420
The downside is he's easily spotted.

123
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,400
I think...

124
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,280
The direction he's watching

125
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:28,210
must be where Butcher Zhang lives.

126
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,260
There should be

127
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,730
other lookouts nearby.

128
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,050
What do we do now?

129
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:33,780
They're all watching.

130
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,560
If we go looking for him,

131
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,159
we'll be walking right into their trap.

132
00:06:37,159 --> 00:06:38,200
Plus, the city is full of

133
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,240
wanted posters with our faces on them.

134
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,600
Moving forward recklessly

135
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,680
would be suicide.

136
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,080
Push to the extreme

137
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,409
to find a way out.

138
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,090
Let's go.

139
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:48,250
How exactly?

140
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,080
Can you handle it?

141
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:56,600
You can't even drink

142
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:57,570
this little bit?

143
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,460
Can you drink anymore?

144
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:03,220
If you can't drink, go sit at the kids' table.

145
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,840
Sit down and take a break.

146
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,850
Oh my, it's so heavy.

147
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:08,800
Sit properly.

148
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,320
Goodness, this is killing me.

149
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:11,400
It's crushing me.

150
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:22,320
Hou Weiqiang.

151
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:31,320
Waiter!

152
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,890
Bring me some sobering tea.

153
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,220
Right away, coming up!

154
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,120
Hou Weiqiang.

155
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,520
We're ignoring you now.

156
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,480
Don't mind him,

157
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:42,920
let's go buy some lamb.

158
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:43,880
Sir,

159
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,180
your sobering tea.

160
00:07:47,159 --> 00:07:47,880
Lamb.

161
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,360
Butcher Zhang's lamb.

162
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,220
How do we deal with Butcher Zhang?

163
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,920
The Twin Heroes have been hiding for a long time.

164
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:11,520
This Butcher Zhang only arrived a few months ago.

165
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,800
I'm afraid they've only just made contact.

166
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,400
Let's try to trick him first.

167
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:28,280
It's been a while since I've had your lamb, Brother Zhang.

168
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,520
What took you so long?

169
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,289
I've been waiting for ages.

170
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,320
Come in, come in.

171
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:35,850
Hurry up.

172
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,260
My village isn't easy to find.

173
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:49,480
You two came all the way from the city,

174
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,600
must have been a tough journey.

175
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,330
Let me get you something to eat.

176
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:55,880
Do you know him?

177
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:56,360
I don't,

178
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,400
I thought you did.

179
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,040
I don't know him either.

180
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,680
Then why is he acting like he knows us?

181
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:00,610
How would I know?

182
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:11,120
Sir.

183
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:12,120
Should we make the arrest?

184
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,560
The men are all in position.

185
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:14,490
What's the rush?

186
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,280
You government officials

187
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:19,240
are always so eager for quick results, aren't you?

188
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,880
The lamb from our village

189
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:23,840
is very popular with city folks.

190
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,580
Even the wild dogs outside

191
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,130
are constantly craving it.

192
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,460
Have some water first.

193
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:32,840
Thank you.

194
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,090
Everyone stay calm.

195
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,220
What are you doing?

196
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,570
Do you have a death wish?

197
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:47,900
Who are you people?

198
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:54,080
Since you asked who we are.

199
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:58,780
This flatbread

200
00:09:59,040 --> 00:09:59,840
is still warm.

201
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:03,680
The notice board at the flatbread stall

202
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:06,580
has sketches of wanted criminals all over the city.

203
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,170
Didn't you see that?

204
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,400
I can't read,

205
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,260
why would I look at that stuff?

206
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,560
We're here to rescue you.

207
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,840
The chubby guy who sat at the tea stall all day

208
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,600
with just one pot of tea,

209
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:27,880
the worker across from your place who's been kneading dough all day,

210
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:28,640
and that man

211
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:31,480
who's been trying to make sugar figurines but can't even make a decent one.

212
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,480
Don't tell me

213
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,480
you didn't notice anything suspicious.

214
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,040
I'm just an ordinary citizen,

215
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,560
why should I fear the guards outside?

216
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:38,960
Did I mention any guards?

217
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,080
No, you didn't.

218
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,320
We, the Inseparable Heroes, came to meet you,

219
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:47,650
and you're worried we might be impostors.

220
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:51,580
Autumn osmanthus,

221
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,200
lotus flowers for miles.

222
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,280
Autumn osmanthus,

223
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,000
lotus flowers for miles.

224
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:02,720
What era do you think this is?

225
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:03,960
Using those old phrases.

226
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,360
You've been exposed already.

227
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,400
Do you really think these outdated passwords

228
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,600
aren't known to them?

229
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,930
Raise a million troops,

230
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,880
stand ready at Wu Mountain.
