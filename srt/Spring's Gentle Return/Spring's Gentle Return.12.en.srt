1
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:52,760
My dear.

2
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:54,090
Cricket is back,

3
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:55,010
just in time,

4
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:56,900
the wine is perfectly warmed.

5
00:00:58,680 --> 00:00:59,320
What's

6
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,600
the special occasion today?

7
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:02,960
Cai Zhisheng is dead,

8
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,879
but his words opened my eyes.

9
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:08,280
If we want to continue living well together,

10
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:09,400
we need to be honest with each other,

11
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:10,730
and lay our hearts bare.

12
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,340
Please sit.

13
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,039
You can't

14
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:46,580
drink anymore.

15
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:47,960
See,

16
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,960
you're just too aggressive.

17
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,840
A gentleman uses words, not fists,

18
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,900
but you're always getting physical.

19
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:55,920
You've said that one before,

20
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:56,979
say something new.

21
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:35,680
My dear,

22
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,000
am I handsome?

23
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,920
There are more skilled fighters.

24
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,120
Yet you two

25
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,890
don't have a scratch on you.

26
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,730
What do you mean we're not hurt?

27
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,280
We've suffered severe emotional trauma.

28
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,760
We're even afraid to go home now.

29
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,080
Those people probably just wanted to capture us for questioning,

30
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,120
that's why they didn't try to kill us.

31
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,600
Then why didn't you

32
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:10,560
go after them

33
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,400
and capture them all at once?

34
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,160
Just the two of us?

35
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,080
Sir Chang,

36
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,160
shouldn't you be questioning

37
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,040
whether those five men in black

38
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:20,100
are actually spies from Yun Kingdom?

39
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:21,200
Enough.

40
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,640
I'll make note of this matter.

41
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:23,440
You may go now.

42
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,560
Chang Wuming, are you deaf or something?

43
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,240
I said we're too scared to go back home.

44
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,280
Just because you can't go home doesn't mean you can stay at the magistrate's office.

45
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,280
Alright, alright.

46
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,140
Officer Chang,

47
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,530
thank you for your help.

48
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:35,850
Let's go.

49
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,440
Why are you always picking fights with people?

50
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:39,440
Every single day.

51
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,520
Can't you see he's just brushing us off?

52
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,520
But causing a scene in court isn't the solution either.

53
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,880
Then what do you suggest we do?

54
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:45,440
What now?

55
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,040
Do you remember this thing?

56
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:49,500
This...

57
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,450
the one from Butcher Zhang.

58
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:52,720
When the time comes,

59
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:53,280
we'll find one.

60
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,540
What are you two doing?

61
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,600
We were ambushed by spies last night,

62
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,360
we're here to report it.

63
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,640
When will these people ever stop?

64
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,160
I already gave you time off.

65
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,040
Don't worry about this matter,

66
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:03,840
leave it to me.

67
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,170
Okay, thanks, boss.

68
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,280
Why didn't you give the signal tube to Xing?

69
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:09,740
I was...

70
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,320
It was urgent, I forgot.

71
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:13,040
I thought we were still suspects.

72
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:13,760
That's true.

73
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,360
So those guards won't come after us again,

74
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,360
it's so annoying.

75
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:17,600
Yes.

76
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:19,860
Your Highness.

77
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:21,880
This humble one doesn't know how I've offended Your Highness.

78
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,540
No need to put on an act with me,

79
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,460
get up and talk.

80
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,960
I've been investigating Yang Tao for days.

81
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:32,760
Since I know she was once a secret guard of Da Cheng,

82
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:35,240
I naturally know about your relationship.

83
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,400
I have just one question.

84
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,360
Once you secret guards enter this door,

85
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,760
you never leave for life.

86
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,980
How could Yang Tao escape unscathed?

87
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,720
How did she manage it?

88
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,400
Your master

89
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:52,080
is the current Young Prince Zhao Kuo of Luling.

90
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,850
Are you suggesting I should go ask him?

91
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,320
If Cai Zhisheng is dead,

92
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:08,090
why are these wolves chasing after us?

93
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:09,600
Indeed,

94
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:10,560
I also think

95
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,720
there are many suspicious points

96
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,320
about Cai Zhisheng's death.

97
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,160
The city defense map,

98
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,530
the one that Butcher Zhang wanted,

99
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:22,780
the Twin Heroes told him to collect it at Hele Tower,

100
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,100
but Cai Zhisheng never showed up,

101
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,340
and officials didn't find it at his home either.

102
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:33,460
Do you think

103
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,770
Cai Zhisheng might still be alive?

104
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:38,450
That's impossible.

105
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,680
We saw him being carried out with our own eyes.

106
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:41,810
Don't overthink it.

107
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:42,640
Or maybe

108
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,730
our deduction was correct,

109
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,320
and Cai Zhisheng wasn't the Twin Heroes at all.

110
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:00,400
Sir Chang.

111
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,800
Everything that happened today

112
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,880
has been fully documented here.

113
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,760
Tell the Young Prince

114
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,120
no matter how this guy tries to hide,

115
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,720
I will find him

116
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,960
and grind his bones to dust.

117
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:58,940
What are you doing?

118
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,680
Tell your leader to come see me.

119
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,210
What are you talking about?

120
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,320
Osmanthus in autumn.

121
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:06,120
Lotus flowers for ten miles.

122
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,080
Raise an army of a million men,

123
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,410
stand ready at Mount Wu,

124
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:10,160
you are the Inseparable Heroes.

125
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:10,820
Step aside.

126
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:19,600
But if Cai Zhisheng isn't one of the Inseparable Heroes,

127
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,530
why would he admit to it?

128
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:23,920
What I'm questioning now

129
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,930
is actually that painting.

130
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:28,180
Cai Zhisheng's deceased wife

131
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,570
looks exactly like you.

132
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,080
I believe coincidences exist in this world,

133
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:32,400
but

134
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,680
two people who look completely identical

135
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,280
is too much of a coincidence.

136
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,480
Are you saying

137
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,580
that painting is fake too?

138
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,180
That can't be determined,

139
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:45,400
but the only thing we can be sure of now is

140
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:47,040
Zhang the butcher is indeed a spy,

141
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,159
and all his leads

142
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,480
point to the government office.

143
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:53,080
Then why are you holding the archive registry?

144
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,920
So I've been thinking,

145
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,960
have we all been misled by Cai Zhisheng?

146
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,420
Think about it.

147
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:02,040
If it weren't for this Cai Zhisheng matter,

148
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,520
what would we be doing right now?

149
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,400
Wouldn't we be investigating people in the government office?

150
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,260
And this person

151
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:07,720
will do the same as us,

152
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,320
they will also go to the archives

153
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:09,960
to look for

154
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,160
city defense maps

155
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:13,420
or important documents like registers.

156
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,920
So this Cai Zhisheng

157
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:18,260
is just taking the blame for someone in the government,

158
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,720
but investigating this won't help.

159
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:21,640
If I were a spy,

160
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:23,760
I certainly wouldn't leave my name,

161
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:25,440
I'd either secretly tear it out,

162
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,800
or memorize it

163
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,220
and copy it down later.

164
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:29,800
That's right.

165
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,520
But the archives are different.

166
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,960
It's not just borrowing that requires registration,

167
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:37,289
you have to register every time you enter.

168
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:41,360
So we just need to find someone who went in frequently

169
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,690
but borrowed few books.

170
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:45,160
And there are very few such people,

171
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:45,960
only two.

172
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,280
One is a constable from the bailiff squad,

173
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:49,080
Zhang Zaiyou.

174
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:50,610
The other one

175
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,450
is the head of the arrest squad,

176
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:54,800
Xing Dezheng.

177
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,800
I've seen you before.

178
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:04,290
You're the squad leader from Lin'an Prefecture.

179
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,760
The Inseparable Heroes,

180
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,080
which one are you?

181
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,440
Let's first talk about

182
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,040
why you've come to wake me up.

183
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,120
I shouldn't let your trip be wasted.

184
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,850
You still have the nerve to ask!

185
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:16,720
To find you,

186
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,800
we've sacrificed so many of our men.

187
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,800
Why didn't you contact us on your own?

188
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,130
Don't make me ask twice.

189
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,360
His Majesty intends to march south,

190
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:28,280
the next step is to conquer Lin'an,

191
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:29,280
placing you here

192
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,900
wasn't it all for this day?

193
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,040
How long

194
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:36,010
have you been in Lin'an?

195
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,130
Lin'an has beautiful scenery,

196
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,440
honest officials,

197
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,560
and people living in peace and prosperity.

198
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:46,160
Even the stray dogs at the East Gate don't bite.

199
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,650
We've finally had a few years of peace,

200
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,400
why must you instigate war?

201
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,360
Don't forget your mission.

202
00:09:56,920 --> 00:10:00,240
All these years, so many people you've sent have vanished without a trace.

203
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,280
Are those guards

204
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,090
really that dedicated?

205
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,960
You killed them.

206
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:10,560
Old Xing.

207
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,040
That old bachelor

208
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,880
barely knows any characters

209
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,760
and is less educated than I am.

210
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:16,960
How is that possible?

211
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:19,600
But I remember he told me

212
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,520
that whenever he skipped work

213
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:24,120
he liked to sneak into the archives to slack off

214
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:26,680
and read those illustrated picture books.

215
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,720
What comic book

216
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,650
are you talking about? You've read it too.

217
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:34,880
Of course I haven't read it,

218
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:35,720
he has.

219
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:36,920
You know all about it

220
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:38,380
yet you still suspect him.

221
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:39,300
This...

222
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:39,960
Isn't this where

223
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,290
my deduction has led us?

224
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,680
Use your brain for a second.

225
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:44,730
Just look at him,

226
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,760
he eats and writes with his right hand,

227
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:48,520
he can't even draw a circle properly with his left hand.

228
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:50,520
And you think he could kill someone?

229
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,640
Anyway, over these years

230
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,850
we've sent wild geese about six times.

231
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,720
If there was never any response,

232
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,740
shouldn't we stop pursuing this?

233
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:10,570
You actually betrayed your brothers!

234
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:12,840
Yes.

235
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,040
I was born in Yun Kingdom,

236
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,810
but now I'm a citizen of Cheng Kingdom,

237
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:21,050
how could I possibly be brothers with you Yun people?

238
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,600
Hela Wo has shown me kindness,

239
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,560
that's why I cooperate with him.

240
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,060
Who do you think you are

241
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,600
to dare control me!

242
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,080
You traitor!

243
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:34,760
When I return, I will report to the royal court,

244
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:38,160
even if I have to join forces with the secret guards to eliminate you.

245
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,090
That's assuming

246
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,280
you live long enough.

247
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,360
Anyway,

248
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,810
we still need to investigate this.

249
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,360
But all your reasoning

250
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:27,240
is based on

251
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:30,700
the assumption that Cai Zhisheng isn't one of the Twin Heroes.

252
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:31,800
Indeed.

253
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,050
I've been struggling with this

254
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,360
but now it seems

255
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,240
only by thoroughly investigating Cai Zhisheng

256
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,240
and all his issues

257
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:40,980
can we solve this problem.

258
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,880
I'm thinking of someone,

259
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,040
the butler, Ye.
