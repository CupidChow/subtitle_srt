1
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:43,680
Where have you been?

2
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,010
I was late getting help.

3
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,400
Where are the people you called?

4
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:48,530
They went with them.

5
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:49,700
Officer Chang,

6
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:50,620
Officer Chang,

7
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:51,600
Officer Chang,

8
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,330
we can't hold them off anymore!

9
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:54,610
Go watch the prison.

10
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:56,700
I'll deal with these rats myself.

11
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,240
Fan Nan is making his move now.

12
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,900
This shouldn't be happening.

13
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,600
Intruders have broken into the magistrate's office

14
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:15,120
Go help quickly!

15
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:15,640
Let's go!

16
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:16,039
Hurry!

17
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:17,840
Xing.

18
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:20,010
What's happening outside?

19
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:29,760
Cricket

20
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:30,300
my dear.

21
00:01:34,039 --> 00:01:34,570
Hurry up!

22
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:35,320
Go!

23
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:42,729
Cricket.

24
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:44,160
Is this your plan?

25
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,300
Then who are these people?

26
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:52,560
They look like the Wolf Gang.

27
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,289
The Wolf Gang

28
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:54,640
these people are really risking their lives

29
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,520
coming to the magistrate's office.

30
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:57,450
Where's Fan Nan?

31
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,920
I don't know.

32
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,400
What are you standing there for?

33
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:10,930
Let's go!

34
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,800
The Inseparable Heroes.

35
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,480
The Inseparable Heroes.

36
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,680
Thank you for saving my life today, sister

37
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,680
If you don't leave Lin'an by tomorrow

38
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:25,600
next time we meet

39
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,860
don't blame me if my blade shows no mercy.

40
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:30,520
Cricket

41
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,450
are you alright?

42
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:32,370
I'm fine.

43
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,360
Won't you stay a bit longer?

44
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,120
Are you okay?

45
00:02:35,079 --> 00:02:36,540
I was so worried about you.

46
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,280
You should leave quickly,

47
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,410
and don't come back.

48
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,200
No way.

49
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:42,940
I just found a lead.

50
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,040
What are you investigating?

51
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,640
Do you realize you almost died in that cell?

52
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:50,170
Cricket.

53
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,360
Don't be hasty,

54
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:54,250
Yang Tao must have her reasons for doing this.

55
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,360
The pine soot ink in the government office

56
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,240
matches the count of official paper,

57
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,970
with no cases of fraud or theft.

58
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:02,100
If what Cai Zhisheng said is true,

59
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:04,040
the letters from the Twin Heroes

60
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:06,960
must have been written during regular office hours.

61
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:07,600
However,

62
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:10,170
it could also be to create a diversion.

63
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:11,640
Cai Zhisheng,

64
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,010
what's he after?

65
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,720
This is what you're after.

66
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:16,600
What is this?

67
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,480
It's so densely written with so many characters.

68
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:21,600
Cai Zhisheng has been frequently traveling

69
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,600
between Dacheng and Yun Kingdom to trade information,

70
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,640
and has long been on the government's watch list.

71
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:25,200
In here

72
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:28,360
are records of his communications with enemy agents.

73
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,660
We've all been deceived by Cai Zhisheng.

74
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,720
If I'm not mistaken,

75
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,900
those men in black tonight

76
00:03:37,079 --> 00:03:38,200
were sent by him.

77
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,040
He wants to kill us

78
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,650
to frame us as suspects.

79
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,240
I'm done investigating.

80
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:02,880
Sir

81
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,720
do you really have to do this?

82
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,520
Have you packed up everything

83
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,600
I gave you?

84
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:13,800
You should go now.

85
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,700
I'll take care of the rest.

86
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:16,560
Sir

87
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:17,839
I can't just leave you here alone.

88
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:18,899
Leave immediately

89
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:21,680
or I'll burn this whole place down.

90
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:13,640
Child,

91
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,880
this is all I can do for you.

92
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:24,480
Wanqing,

93
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:26,720
wait for me.

94
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:34,890
I'm tired, Yangtao,

95
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,610
let's get a divorce.

96
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,000
Cricket.

97
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:43,970
Have you lost your mind?

98
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,060
What nonsense are you talking about?

99
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,159
Don't you want a divorce too?

100
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:55,040
Couples

101
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,760
fight at dawn but make up by dusk.

102
00:05:59,000 --> 00:05:59,400
Chief,

103
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,880
please help me investigate Cai Zhisheng.

104
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,610
But as for our personal matter,

105
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,160
we'll resolve it ourselves.

106
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,890
Could you give us some privacy?

107
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:11,480
Wait,

108
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,130
this is my house.

109
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:15,840
Fine.

110
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,480
I'll head back to the office

111
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,800
and thoroughly investigate this Cai Zhisheng.

112
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:19,800
If he's really involved in something suspicious,

113
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,260
I'll arrest him tomorrow.

114
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,970
It's rare that we're on the same page for once.

115
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,660
All that talk about

116
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,560
profound gratitude

117
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,200
and carefree existence.

118
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,880
I just bought you wonton soup a few times,

119
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,080
and you wrote so formally,

120
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:22,880
it doesn't sound like you at all.

121
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,140
What about you?

122
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:27,040
All that poetic nonsense about my beauty,

123
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:28,560
written so bluntly.

124
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,620
It's all bullshit.

125
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,200
If you once

126
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,600
loved wandering the world

127
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,800
and healing the sick,

128
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:37,740
then why did you

129
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:41,800
still marry me?

130
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,420
You think you've held me back,

131
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,530
but you've been by my side for three years.

132
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,480
I have my reasons.

133
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,520
I have my reasons too.

134
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,620
Neither of us is doing this out of affection.

135
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,200
The light was on just now,

136
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,130
why did it go out?

137
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,380
After them!

138
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:15,680
Why are we chasing?

139
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,940
What if it's an ambush?

140
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:20,880
Am I slowing you down?

141
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:21,720
Shut up!

142
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,090
Does it hurt?

143
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:37,620
It hurts more here.

144
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:49,160
They've found us so quickly.

145
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:00,020
They're enemy agents.

146
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,320
This place isn't safe anymore.

147
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:02,800
Let's go.

148
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:03,860
Where are we going?

149
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,200
Brother Chen?

150
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,320
What Brother Chen?

151
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,240
The Inseparable Heroes!

152
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:10,600
Let's go!

153
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,080
Run!

154
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:12,540
Someone, help!

155
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:13,600
The Inseparable Heroes are here!

156
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,660
The Inseparable Heroes, after them!

157
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:20,280
Over there!

158
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,340
Let's check it out.

159
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,080
The Inseparable Heroes!

160
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:25,960
Hurry!

161
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:26,960
Help!

162
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:27,680
Nothing here.

163
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,010
Let's check over there.

164
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:32,240
This way!

165
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,080
Brothers, where are they?

166
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,200
We were just chasing them.

167
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,800
Split up and keep searching.

168
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:38,600
Hurry!

169
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,000
When do you think

170
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
these wolves started following us?

171
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:49,080
When we left Cai Zhisheng's house.

172
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,160
I don't think so.

173
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,880
If they wanted to kill us then,

174
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
they would have done it already,

175
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,060
why wait until now?

176
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:56,640
I think

177
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,680
someone's trying to muddy the waters,

178
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:00,940
to escape in the chaos.

179
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,660
Then let's go meet this Cai Zhisheng,

180
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,450
maybe we can redeem ourselves.

181
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,160
Stop right there!

182
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:16,900
Meet at the paper mill.

183
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,090
Let's all attack together.

184
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:38,560
Yang.

185
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:39,250
Yang Tao.

186
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:44,920
Who are you?

187
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,530
Why are you stopping me?

188
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:48,320
Young master.

189
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,420
Have you forgotten me?

190
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,000
It's me, Yue'an.

191
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:06,760
Go check over there.

192
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:07,290
Yes, sir.

193
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,960
The first part of the password is

194
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:14,920
autumn osmanthus,

195
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:16,080
lotus flowers for ten miles.

196
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,360
The second part is raise an army of a million,

197
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,600
stand ready at Mount Wu.

198
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:19,600
Wait here for orders.

199
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,660
I'll be right back.

200
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:21,320
Danger!

201
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:25,880
Follow my orders.

202
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:27,760
Young master.

203
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,400
Young Master,

204
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,320
do you remember now?

205
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,400
I'm not any Young Master.

206
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:42,280
I am Chen Yiqu.

207
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:44,420
I need to save Yang Tao.

208
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:48,000
The imperial guards are hunting for you all over the city.

209
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,240
Don't stop me.

210
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:50,480
Young Master!

211
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:51,520
Young Master!

212
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:56,800
Boss!

213
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:57,800
Boss!

214
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,920
Something terrible has happened,

215
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,920
Boss, the imperial guards are taking credit for our work.

216
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,360
You must stand up for us.

217
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,200
What's the point of taking credit

218
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,040
or making decisions?

219
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,040
The crickets!

220
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,340
We discovered them first.

221
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:09,640
Houwei is arresting people everywhere now,

222
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:10,840
and we're left out of it.

223
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:13,280
Those are the Paired Heroes worth 100 taels!

224
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:13,880
Exactly!

225
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:15,200
Let's go see.

226
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:15,880
Let's go.

227
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:17,760
Yang Tao!

228
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:19,450
Yang Tao!

229
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:20,610
Yang Tao!

230
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:22,740
Where did everyone go?

231
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:25,800
Stop pulling me.

232
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:29,280
Princess!

233
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:30,320
Cricket!

234
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:31,920
What cricket?

235
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,770
He's one of the Twin Heroes.

236
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,400
How dare you

237
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,120
kidnap the Princess!

238
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:37,520
No!

239
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:38,930
Who kidnapped whom?

240
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,160
What are you waiting for?

241
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:41,840
Get them!

242
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:56,160
Princess!

243
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,320
We're on the same side!

244
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:58,520
Traitors in wartime!

245
00:13:58,800 --> 00:13:59,330
Must die!

246
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:01,210
Boss!

247
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:02,880
Did you catch Yang Tao?

248
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:03,540
You didn't?

249
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,860
Why did you run off with the Princess?

250
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,600
She was just here.

251
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:09,720
With so many people around,

252
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,160
after she threw me out,

253
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,800
and surrounded by all of you,

254
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,330
how could you not catch her?

255
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:20,380
Paper mill!

256
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:21,900
I remember now!

257
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:23,360
Cai's Paper Mill!

258
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,800
Cai's Paper Mill.

259
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,280
A princess from Qinye,

260
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:34,160
and a constable from the magistrate's office,

261
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:37,000
no wonder these Twin Heroes are so elusive.

262
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:38,450
Arrest them!

263
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,210
Arrest them!

264
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:41,440
Sir!

265
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:42,720
I'm not one of the Twin Heroes,

266
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:43,840
why are you arresting me?

267
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:44,700
I'm not either!

268
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,120
Whether you are or not,

269
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:48,040
we'll find out after interrogation.

270
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:48,480
Take them away!
