1
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,579
Left-handed knife attack again.

2
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,040
Stop talking.

3
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,000
This medicine

4
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,680
will only temporarily block your blood flow.

5
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,560
You should know

6
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:55,700
it won't last long.

7
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:58,800
I know.

8
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:00,890
You're a wolf's cub.

9
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:02,940
Don't move.

10
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,000
If you move,

11
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,060
you'll die faster.

12
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,160
You'd better cooperate with me,

13
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,820
I can help you get revenge.

14
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:25,480
Cricket.

15
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,240
Guess what lead I found today.

16
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:44,360
This time I won't show any mercy.

17
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,340
The lord requests your presence.

18
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,400
What if I refuse?

19
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,700
It concerns Chen Yiqu.

20
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:57,210
Lead the way.

21
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,260
Wolf Thirteen.

22
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,040
Save your strength now.

23
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:09,720
Don't talk.

24
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,440
I'll ask, you answer.

25
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:11,920
If yes,

26
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:12,730
just nod.

27
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:13,480
If no,

28
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:14,920
just shake your head.

29
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,240
Was your attacker

30
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,400
left-handed with the knife?

31
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,690
Was it the Inseparable Duo?

32
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,440
Indeed.

33
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,680
Apart from their code names,

34
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,560
do you know their real names?

35
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,570
So they came to assassinate you

36
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:50,720
because of

37
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,800
internal conflicts among your people?

38
00:04:55,159 --> 00:04:56,020
Wolf Thirteen,

39
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,840
are they government agents?

40
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:02,400
Hold on,

41
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,130
which government official sent them?

42
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:07,400
Thirteen.

43
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,850
So they are government agents.

44
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:46,760
Come out.

45
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,120
The messenger has arrived unexpectedly.

46
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,400
Does the young prince have new orders?

47
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,420
Have you found the person?

48
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,159
Not yet.

49
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:00,600
This thief

50
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,040
is quite cunning.

51
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,200
No matter,

52
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:05,640
catching the thief can wait for now.

53
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:08,560
But our lord now commands you to use any means necessary

54
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,890
to eliminate that couple posing as spies.

55
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:14,480
But Chen Yiqu has the status of a crown prince,

56
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:18,800
and Princess Li Yue'an is interfering as well.

57
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:20,920
With my rank,

58
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,880
I fear I can't contend with them.

59
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:23,810
Can't it be done?

60
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,440
If I find a way,

61
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,880
it could be managed.

62
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,200
Tell the young prince

63
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:33,840
I'll start planning this matter right away.

64
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:34,840
I await your news.

65
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,320
Brother Chen,

66
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,920
where are you rushing off to?

67
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,080
Looking for Hou Wei.

68
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:49,640
There are wolf cubs.

69
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:50,240
Wolf cubs?

70
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,680
Did we stir up a wolves' den?

71
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:57,680
So many wolf cubs.

72
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:04,760
Brother Chen,

73
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,810
where are the wolf cubs?

74
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:08,400
At my family's

75
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,000
medical clinic.

76
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,400
Then where are you going?

77
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:11,320
Brother Chen?

78
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:15,410
I'm busy, Xiao Yang.

79
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:16,780
Chief Xing.

80
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:18,720
Um,

81
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:21,920
where are the household department files with our records?

82
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:22,380
Inside,

83
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,330
on the right,

84
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,490
the second cabinet.

85
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:44,360
Yang.

86
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:45,680
Has anyone

87
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,240
borrowed any archive documents recently?

88
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,640
Chen Yiqu from your department took some today,

89
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:53,300
said he needed to calculate his promotion date.

90
00:07:59,240 --> 00:07:59,600
Boss.

91
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:00,200
Boss.

92
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:01,800
Yang.

93
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:02,960
Boss.

94
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,280
Chen said.

95
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:08,570
There's a wolf cub at their clinic.

96
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:09,860
Where is he?

97
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:10,650
I don't know.

98
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,160
Someone tossed him a note,

99
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,120
and then he left.

100
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:16,440
Shouldn't we notify Hou Wei?

101
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,580
Let's go first.

102
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:19,760
Let's go, Xiao Yang.

103
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:20,290
Let's go.

104
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:32,960
Fan Nan.

105
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,360
You lied to me.

106
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:39,169
Do you really think our lord will spare Chen Yiqu?

107
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,159
Don't you dare lay a finger on him.

108
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,780
Codename: Silver Needle.

109
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:45,600
At age 10,

110
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:47,570
sold into the secret guard.

111
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:48,800
At 12,

112
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,090
failed escape attempt.

113
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,040
At 15,

114
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,100
became an elite agent,

115
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,840
sent to Yun Kingdom on assassination missions.

116
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:57,480
At 18,

117
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,410
became the local secret guard commander.

118
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:01,480
At 21,

119
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:04,040
successfully assassinated Helawa,

120
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,360
retrieved his head,

121
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:07,020
earned merit and retired.

122
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,640
It seems the princess has told you everything.

123
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:17,300
How long were you planning to keep me in the dark?

124
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,360
Until this life is over,

125
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,040
until

126
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,280
death.

127
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:24,980
Enough,

128
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,930
stop with the sentimental talk in front of me.

129
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,740
Is this how Zhao Kuo taught you to handle things?

130
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:32,560
Tell me,

131
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,400
what exactly do you want?

132
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,280
If you wanted me dead,

133
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,170
you could have done it already.

134
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:40,840
Smart.

135
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,560
I just want to know

136
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:47,980
what exactly happened

137
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,460
at the paper mill that day.

138
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:51,480
Boss,

139
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,760
will just the two of us be enough?

140
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:55,560
Boss,

141
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,120
will just the two of us be enough?

142
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,520
Maybe we should bring more people.

143
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:00,320
There are so many spies in the city now,

144
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:03,520
how do you know there aren't any in the government office?

145
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:21,660
Close the door.

146
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:39,640
He's dead.

147
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,120
Dead.

148
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:47,680
Gone.

149
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:50,640
Shaobing.

150
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:56,080
Want to get promoted and rich?

151
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:56,680
Get rich.

152
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:58,160
Of course.

153
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:01,520
How?

154
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:04,380
Let me tell you,

155
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:05,560
I'll be

156
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:06,890
going back soon.

157
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:10,610
Things are exactly as I described.

158
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,280
You are imperial guards,

159
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:14,540
surely you have ways to verify the truth.

160
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:17,240
You're really not the Inseparable Duo.

161
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,360
Are you stupid?

162
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,720
Not only are we not,

163
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,400
but neither is Cai Zhisheng.

164
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:23,960
I have

165
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,330
a letter from Cai Zhisheng to Cricket.

166
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,760
You saved his life during the Northern Expedition.

167
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,360
When he learned you lost your memory and ended up here,

168
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:38,760
he's been looking for a chance to repay you.

169
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,040
な

170
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:45,360
Speaking of which

171
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:48,640
That painting was just something I quickly drew based on your appearance.

172
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,500
And all that evidence we prepared

173
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:51,840
was all to prove

174
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:55,880
that the Elder Master and his late wife were the Inseparable Heroes.

175
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,720
If not for this substitution,

176
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:58,840
the Elder Master's time

177
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,640
would have been up in a day or two.

178
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,200
He said being able to repay his benefactor before death

179
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,060
would make his death worthwhile.

180
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,160
If you two aren't the Inseparable Heroes,

181
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:20,890
then who killed all my brothers

182
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,160
last night?

183
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:23,800
Last night...

184
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,720
Those who died last night

185
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,840
were all wolves.
