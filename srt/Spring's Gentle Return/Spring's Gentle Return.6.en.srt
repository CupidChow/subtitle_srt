1
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:45,210
It seems Houwei hasn't found this yet.

2
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,040
I thought

3
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,330
this would be a more prosperous place.

4
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:51,640
This Master Cai used to

5
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:52,840
make quite a fortune,

6
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:54,760
but later he gave away all his wealth

7
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:56,090
for charitable causes.

8
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:57,920
Come to think of it,

9
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:00,000
after I lost my memory and ended up here,

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,330
he once offered me a meal when I was in need.

11
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:04,890
Then let's go meet this generous benefactor.

12
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,040
Oh no.

13
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:07,880
I've lost my hairpin.

14
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:08,760
Really?

15
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:11,360
You must have left it at Butcher Zhang's place.

16
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,690
Never mind, we can't worry about that now.

17
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,280
Easy!

18
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:17,530
Take it easy.

19
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:20,440
Open up! Or I'll break down this door!

20
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,000
What brings you two here?

21
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:24,800
We're here to

22
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:25,400
buy paper,

23
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,289
specifically Yuan book paper.

24
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,039
Please leave,

25
00:01:29,039 --> 00:01:31,300
our paper mill no longer produces paper.

26
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,320
Could you let us see

27
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,220
your previous customer records?

28
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:38,729
If you keep bothering us, I'll call the authorities.

29
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:44,640
What are you doing?

30
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,200
Kneel!

31
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:49,520
My dear!

32
00:01:50,039 --> 00:01:50,720
Let's calm down.

33
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:51,920
I am calm.

34
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:23,920
Yangtao!

35
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:36,680
Yangtao!

36
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,579
How did you fall like this?

37
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,500
Sorry, my mistake.

38
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,720
Forget what you just saw.

39
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:45,850
What just happened?

40
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:47,940
Why is it you two again?

41
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,160
What exactly do you want?

42
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:51,220
You've damaged the master's coffin.

43
00:02:58,640 --> 00:02:59,240
Coffin?

44
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:02,040
Who makes coffins out of paper?

45
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,570
You're trying to extort us.

46
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,480
I've spent my life making paper.

47
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,440
After I die, I want a paper coffin.

48
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:12,000
What's wrong with that?

49
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:17,280
Sir,

50
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:18,360
why aren't you resting in bed?

51
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,890
What are you doing out here?

52
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:26,720
Sir.

53
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,440
You may not remember,

54
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:31,890
but you once showed me kindness by offering me a meal.

55
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,130
Today's incident is indeed our fault.

56
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:36,520
How much would you like,

57
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,200
no matter the amount,

58
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,930
I'll pay you everything I have.

59
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,740
This paper coffin.

60
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,240
It used up all the paper in my workshop.

61
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,360
Money can't possibly compensate for it.

62
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:49,800
Well,

63
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:52,440
how would you like to resolve this matter?

64
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,520
Though my workshop has no paper left,

65
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:57,880
the tools and materials for papermaking remain.

66
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,760
You don't expect us to make paper for you here, do you?

67
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:02,760
We have urgent matters to attend to.

68
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,680
If there's no solution,

69
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,720
then let's report this to the authorities.

70
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:09,380
Wait, wait.

71
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:10,560
We'll make it.

72
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:21,480
Sir,

73
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:23,900
what are you looking for? Let me help you.

74
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,960
There's no other way.

75
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:40,250
Have you prepared everything I asked for?

76
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:41,620
It's all ready.

77
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,940
But what do you need those things for?

78
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:46,240
Knowing too much

79
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:47,720
isn't good for you.

80
00:04:49,159 --> 00:04:50,640
My days are numbered.

81
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,800
There are certain things

82
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,880
that I'm destined to do.

83
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,120
Commander,

84
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,540
the Golden Crow Map

85
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:16,360
has returned to the heavens.

86
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,080
What?

87
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,760
Where are the Inseparable Heroes?

88
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,220
This is all we have for now.

89
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,580
I suspect it's a trick.

90
00:05:47,159 --> 00:05:49,560
I knew those people from Dacheng couldn't be trusted.

91
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,760
This Golden Crow Map

92
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,040
was probably betrayed by them.

93
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,760
Go wake up all our dormant wolves

94
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:00,080
and capture these two traitors.

95
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:13,320
Sir, you asked for me?

96
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,760
I was about to hold a celebration feast,

97
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:17,420
but the coroner just reported

98
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:20,540
that all the bodies at Butcher Zhang's house were male,

99
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,280
and one of them had an old leg injury

100
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,460
that matches one of my subordinates.

101
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:28,220
All our efforts were for nothing!

102
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,000
Sir,

103
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:31,050
I was just about to report this.

104
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,820
In Butcher Zhang's house,

105
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:33,960
we discovered a secret door.

106
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,620
Why didn't you say so earlier?

107
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:36,520
Guards!

108
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:38,800
Yes, sir.

109
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,520
Call everyone back

110
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:42,220
and search the entire city

111
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,940
along their escape route.

112
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:45,400
Wait!

113
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:48,280
Princess.

114
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,640
Greetings, Princess.

115
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:51,560
Princess.

116
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I'll investigate these two myself.

117
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,920
I was ordered to lead troops north to fight the enemy,

118
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,240
when passing through Lin'an,

119
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,240
I saw this notice.

120
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,200
What's going on here?

121
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,600
These are the Jianjie Twin Heroes,

122
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,130
spies from the Yun Kingdom.

123
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,200
Spies?

124
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,580
The rest of you, withdraw.

125
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:15,720
After you, Princess.

126
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,520
Four years ago, Prince Zhao Jian of Luling

127
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:23,880
went missing during the northern expedition.

128
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,120
Are you aware of this?

129
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:27,560
You're saying

130
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,600
that the Prince of Luling

131
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,200
actually colluded with Yun Kingdom

132
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,400
and became a spy?

133
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,210
How dare you!

134
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:38,560
The Prince went missing while fighting enemies in the north,

135
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,890
how dare you insult him!

136
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,320
Princess,

137
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:44,080
all matters of intelligence and surveillance

138
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,400
have always been under my Surveillance Department's authority.

139
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,240
If anyone tries to slander the Prince,

140
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,560
I, Chang Wuming, would be the first to step forward

141
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,640
to clear his name.

142
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:55,120
However, with the northern conflict flaring up again,

143
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:58,520
if the Princess delays military affairs because of this matter,

144
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,320
that would be a serious offense.

145
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,080
Fine.

146
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,000
You just wait!

147
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,440
Please calm down, Princess.

148
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:10,080
We each have our duties,

149
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,680
and we only seek to ease our ruler's burdens

150
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,640
and speak for the people.

151
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,650
I'll only say this once,

152
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,400
the first step in making bamboo paper

153
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,600
is to create bamboo fiber.

154
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,320
The bamboo fiber must go through steaming, soaking, boiling, filtering,

155
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:31,480
and dozens of other processes

156
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,559
before it can become pulp.

157
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:33,480
Your task today

158
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:35,480
is to turn these bamboo stalks into fiber.

159
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:36,140
Get to work!

160
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:37,320
All right.

161
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,610
What are you doing? Be serious.

162
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:46,320
You're not actually planning to make paper here, are you?

163
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,600
By the time the paper's finished,

164
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,530
we'd have our heads chopped off seven or eight times.

165
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:51,650
That's true.

166
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,920
But we need to make them lower their guard first,

167
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:56,380
so we can get the registry.

168
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:05,970
Put some effort into it!

169
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:11,850
This is taking too long.

170
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,440
Once they find the guard's body,

171
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,840
we're done for.

172
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,180
Then what should we do?

173
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:19,160
We can't just grab it, can we?

174
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:23,440
That's exactly what I had in mind.

175
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:23,700
Hey!

176
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,410
What are you doing? Hey!

177
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:28,640
What now?

178
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,340
I don't know how to do this.

179
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:31,820
This is just...

180
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:04,360
Why are all these books about spies?

181
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:05,880
Spies,

182
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,260
can you be serious?

183
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,360
Look for registers or account books.

184
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,880
I am being serious, okay?

185
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,080
Yang Tao.

186
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,320
I've been wanting to ask you,

187
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:32,520
when Butcher Zhang recited those two lines of poetry,

188
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,860
how did you know they were a password?

189
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:36,740
What password?

190
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,440
A normal person

191
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,600
hearing those verses

192
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,560
wouldn't think they're a password.

193
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:43,620
Autumn osmanthus.

194
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:45,120
Ten miles of lotus flowers.

195
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,000
What era do you think this is? Using phrases like that.

196
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,520
You've already blown your cover.

197
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:50,580
Do you think they wouldn't recognize

198
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,640
these outdated passwords of yours?

199
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,250
That's how they write it in spy novels!

200
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,440
Besides, wasn't I just traveling around?

201
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,360
And anyway,

202
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:04,480
didn't that butcher Zhang respond to you?

203
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,140
Traveling,

204
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:10,170
and then just happened to get married.

205
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,120
This...

206
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,010
it's obviously you.

207
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,720
You drew this when you were in Yun Kingdom, didn't you?

208
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:19,600
This kind of attire

209
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,860
is only worn during wedding ceremonies.

210
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,640
That's not me.

211
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,850
Well, that man isn't me anyway.

212
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,840
That man is me.

213
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,480
That's a portrait of me and my late wife

214
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,440
Feng Wanqing

215
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:35,880
on our wedding day.

216
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:37,480
Late wife?

217
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:41,600
You old man!

218
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,400
Your legs are perfectly fine. Why are you in a wheelchair?

219
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,360
You're deceiving us!

220
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,040
I

221
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:46,640
can walk,

222
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,120
I just don't want to.

223
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:52,920
Okay.

224
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:54,840
He lied to me...

225
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,280
Calm down.

226
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:00,360
Hand over the purchase list for the Yuan paper.

227
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:02,900
You want to kill me?

228
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:06,820
This old man has been tired of living for a long time.

229
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,120
Go ahead!

230
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:10,040
You think I don't dare?

231
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:11,360
No, don't.

232
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:12,280
I was about to.

233
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:13,120
Stay calm,

234
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,400
let's win him over,

235
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,480
the lead is important.

236
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,920
I am calm.

237
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,770
If you won't make a move,

238
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,000
then I will.
