1
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,880
The Yun Kingdom's army has retreated,

2
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,200
and Zhao Kuo's remaining accomplices

3
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,930
have all been eliminated by us.

4
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:49,080
Yue'an,

5
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:50,770
you've worked hard.

6
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:54,940
Kneel down.

7
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,050
Within two days,

8
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:01,000
my report will be delivered to the Emperor,

9
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:01,800
and then,

10
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:05,160
whether it's dismemberment or being minced into paste,

11
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,760
you can choose for yourself.

12
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:11,860
You think you've defeated me?

13
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:13,840
Zhao Kuo,

14
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:18,160
give me the antidote for the poison now.

15
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,560
My report is

16
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:20,560
nothing.

17
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,850
Are you insane? He committed treason!

18
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,579
Once you join the Dark Guards,

19
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:28,250
you'll never escape for the rest of your life.

20
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,640
I've given you a chance to live,

21
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,160
don't be ungrateful.

22
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,640
Even if I die,

23
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,760
I won't let you succeed.

24
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:39,840
Zhao Kuo!

25
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:53,970
Yang Tao!

26
00:02:58,760 --> 00:02:59,320
Yang Tao!

27
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:02,210
Yang Tao!

28
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,250
Don't be afraid,

29
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,440
whether I have to go to the Southern Province

30
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,700
or to the Eastern Edge,

31
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,360
I will find the antidote for you,

32
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,860
I will save you.

33
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:16,480
Yang Tao!

34
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,120
Yang Tao!

35
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,520
That mind-controlling poison

36
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,079
already makes people delirious,

37
00:03:48,079 --> 00:03:50,140
and she forced herself to stay awake,

38
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,680
which triggered the old poison.

39
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,480
Now both poisons are active together,

40
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:54,600
and the toxins have reached her brain.

41
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,860
If we delay any longer,

42
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,320
she won't last six months.

43
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:57,780
Doctor,

44
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:01,800
may I have a word with you in private?

45
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:02,400
Very well.

46
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,420
Is there a cure?

47
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:11,400
It is said that

48
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,040
there's a snow lotus in the Northern Territory

49
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,360
that can cure this poison.

50
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,490
But that snow lotus is extremely rare,

51
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,820
and often grows in treacherous terrain.

52
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,240
As long as there's a cure,

53
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,480
that's all that matters.

54
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,720
No matter how dangerous or difficult,

55
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,400
I will bring back the snow lotus for her.

56
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:25,800
Well,

57
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,620
this won't be as easy as

58
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,480
treating your headache before.

59
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,980
I'll take my leave now.

60
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:34,840
Young master,

61
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,320
are you mentally ill too?

62
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:39,000
Why have I never heard you mention this before?

63
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,610
It happened many years ago.

64
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:42,300
I'll tell you about it slowly.

65
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:43,520
Are you better now?

66
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:45,280
Yes.

67
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:46,440
No.

68
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:47,650
I want to hear it now.

69
00:04:58,920 --> 00:04:59,480
So?

70
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,610
Does this look familiar to you?

71
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,100
This place here

72
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,000
is Hele Tower.

73
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,400
We used to

74
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,440
come here often to wine and dine.

75
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:09,840
Wining and dining

76
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,080
is exactly what I like.

77
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,680
No wonder we're together.

78
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:15,820
For you two,

79
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,680
I've prepared the Yi room.

80
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,320
There won't be any mistakes this time.

81
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,650
Thank you for your help.

82
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,760
Why is it called Room B?

83
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,120
And

84
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:27,480
why does he look

85
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,440
so afraid of me?

86
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,080
Excuse me.

87
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,240
That's not important.

88
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,159
Room B

89
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,920
is where we first met.

90
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,520
Met?

91
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:38,840
It's okay.

92
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,580
Let's take it slow.

93
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,520
It's my fault.

94
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:12,920
That day,

95
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,130
I forgot to book this private room.

96
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,080
This is it,

97
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:17,730
do you remember?

98
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:24,920
Back then,

99
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,800
to part on good terms,

100
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,840
we pretended to be the Inseparable Heroes,

101
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:32,409
which led to everything else we talked about.

102
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,050
Was Xing Dezheng deliberately setting us up?

103
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,240
This room

104
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,120
was booked by Butcher Zhang.

105
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,620
How should I put it,

106
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,820
it was fate, I suppose.

107
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,340
So we're innocent now, right?

108
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:53,620
Of course we are innocent.

109
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,120
From now on,

110
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,820
we'll live freely and follow our hearts.

111
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:59,610
Wherever you want to go,

112
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:00,780
we'll go there,

113
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,780
no one will ever restrict our freedom again.

114
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:07,040
How did you know I've always wanted to travel the world?

115
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:10,040
Even the doctor today suggested I should get out more.

116
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,080
That's why

117
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,520
I submitted my resignation to the court today.

118
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,600
From now on, court affairs

119
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,060
have nothing to do with me.

120
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,200
Then

121
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,160
what about the northern border?

122
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,320
Yue'an is there,

123
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:25,320
with her in charge,

124
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,180
I can rest easy.

125
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:34,080
Taotao.

126
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,280
In my life,

127
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:38,540
there are many things I want to do.

128
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,490
Wherever you go from now on,

129
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:41,890
I'll go with you,

130
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,260
we'll never be apart again in this lifetime.

131
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:47,360
Okay.

132
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,440
We'll never be apart.

133
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,960
Sorry to interrupt you lovebirds

134
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,360
having your private conversation.

135
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:28,040
But there's an imperial decree

136
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,760
that I must announce.

137
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:32,640
Zhao Jian.

138
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,280
Chunran-

139
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,600
I haven't seen you for so long.

140
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:37,960
I've missed you terribly.

141
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:38,559
This is not

142
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:39,760
what it seems.

143
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:40,679
Speak properly.

144
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:41,799
We're not kids anymore.

145
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:42,730
Why are you here?

146
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,640
I'm just making an announcement.

147
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:45,720
They said you were here,

148
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:46,400
so I came.

149
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:48,620
Princess Chunran,

150
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:49,960
stop making trouble.

151
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,000
When I first met her, she was only

152
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:00,200
this tall.

153
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,320
Seems like you have quite a few sisters.

154
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,120
What else don't I know about?

155
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:10,680
By order of His Majesty,

156
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,970
the Crown Prince of Luling,

157
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,680
Zhao Jian and his wife have rendered meritorious service to the nation,

158
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,680
and their new titles and rewards

159
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:21,120
will be arranged by the Ministry of Personnel.

160
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:31,080
As for what follows,

161
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,080
I must speak more quietly.

162
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,480
The Kingdom of Yun still harbors evil intentions

163
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,340
and continues to send people to harass our borders.

164
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:40,920
A storm is brewing.

165
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,760
You two are ordered

166
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,200
to immediately assume the identities

167
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,660
of the Inseparable Heroes

168
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:49,160
under the pretense that they have faked their deaths and escaped,

169
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:51,090
and infiltrate the Kingdom of Yun.

170
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,920
Ensure that all affairs of Yun,

171
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:56,040
great and small, are made known to me.

172
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,200
From now on,

173
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,120
you

174
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,560
are truly

175
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,280
the Inseparable Heroes.

176
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,520
The safety of our Great Cheng

177
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,180
From now on.

178
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,370
rests in your hands.

179
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:09,050
Sir Wang.

180
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,090
The thing is,

181
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,760
the person you're looking for

182
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:12,820
is named Zhao Jian.

183
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:13,480
And I

184
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:14,600
am

185
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:15,520
Chen Yiqu.

186
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,320
Are you defying the imperial order?

187
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,540
That sounds interesting.

188
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,460
Why don't we go?

189
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,040
Do you know what the Twin Heroes are?

190
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:28,000
The Twin Heroes are

191
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,880
the birds that fly wing to wing and the fish that swim eye to eye,

192
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,360
one in the sky and one in the sea,

193
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,360
isn't that fascinating?

194
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,400
But Yun Kingdom is so far away and dangerous.

195
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,200
Stop talking,

196
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,200
we've received the imperial decree.

197
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:35,920
All right.

198
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,040
I'm going too.
