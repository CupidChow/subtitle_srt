1
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:39,880
Palm reading.

2
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:41,720
I don't know how to do that,

3
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:42,180
come on,

4
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:46,250
you're in danger of bloodshed!

5
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:32,720
Cai Zhisheng,

6
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,000
come out here!

7
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:35,680
Why did you lie to us?

8
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:37,720
Impressive,

9
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:40,250
you still managed to find this old man.

10
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:51,979
What's your relationship

11
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:54,020
with the Jiandié Twin Heroes?

12
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,180
The truth is so expensive,

13
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,010
do you have the money to buy it or the life to see it?

14
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,600
You're awake.

15
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,600
I was going to

16
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,120
let you die like this,

17
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:28,920
but then I thought...

18
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,200
Let's see if your husband

19
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,600
will come to save you.

20
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,200
When he comes,

21
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:35,880
I'll kill you both.

22
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,520
Give up that hope.

23
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,960
He's been wanting to divorce me for a while.

24
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:40,640
If I die,

25
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:42,320
he'll just marry someone new.

26
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:42,920
Fine then.

27
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,040
Wait.

28
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:47,520
If I

29
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:48,400
die...

30
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,000
He'd get off too easy.

31
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,680
What if he finds someone prettier

32
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,920
and younger than me?

33
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,210
Stop it, stop it.

34
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:55,960
Your personality

35
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,800
is exactly like

36
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,600
my late wife's.

37
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,400
If she were in this situation,

38
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,440
she would say the same thing.

39
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,080
How could I compare to your late wife?

40
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,680
You two must have been much more loving than us.

41
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,200
What if your husband

42
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,040
forced you

43
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,240
to stay home as a dutiful wife,

44
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,280
or even caused you

45
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,840
to lose your life?

46
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,200
Would you still love him?

47
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,240
I'm not her,

48
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:25,400
I don't know.

49
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,280
But if it were me,

50
00:03:29,079 --> 00:03:32,480
if I love him, I'd be willing to sacrifice everything for him.

51
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,440
You dared to come here alone.

52
00:03:36,079 --> 00:03:37,280
Do you think

53
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:38,560
that love alone

54
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,480
can solve all your problems?

55
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:44,490
You're so concerned about him,

56
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,400
but where is he?

57
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:48,520
Where is he now?

58
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,560
I don't know where he is,

59
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,200
but I believe

60
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,530
he's definitely trying to save me.

61
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,760
Stop dreaming.

62
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,520
He's not coming.

63
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,440
Two of you,

64
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:11,850
guard the back door.

65
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,600
The rest of you stay here

66
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,960
if anyone comes out,

67
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,140
kill them on sight.

68
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,940
I wonder how Yangtao is doing.

69
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,040
You still care about her?

70
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,360
Why don't you worry about us instead?

71
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,020
You coward,

72
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,640
you have no backbone at all.

73
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:29,640
You're no better,

74
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:31,160
you're tied up here just like me.

75
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:33,960
If you weren't still valuable for interrogation,

76
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:36,280
I'd chop you up right now

77
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,090
to show those traitors inside.

78
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:38,880
Sir.

79
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,560
The Twin Heroes are those two,

80
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,880
why tie me up?

81
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,440
Listen, Xing,

82
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:45,370
what kind of constable are you?

83
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,520
Have you forgotten the laws of Dacheng?

84
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,040
Those who assist traitors

85
00:04:49,159 --> 00:04:50,820
are equally guilty of treason

86
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,890
and should be executed on the spot.

87
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,620
I'm not one of the Twin Heroes.

88
00:04:59,159 --> 00:05:00,820
I've never betrayed Dacheng.

89
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:01,880
Because I

90
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:04,250
am the Crown Prince of Dacheng.

91
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,200
If you're the Crown Prince,

92
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,960
then these two must be the Twin Heroes.

93
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,480
The Prince of Luling

94
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:31,560
served as the Northern Campaign General for four years

95
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,120
but disappeared in battle.

96
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:34,940
By imperial mercy,

97
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,920
he was merely stripped of his title

98
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,720
and reduced to commoner status.

99
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,680
Are you trying

100
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:42,840
to impersonate the Prince and betray Dacheng?

101
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,840
Try another identity.

102
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,500
This identity isn't working.

103
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:48,690
What do you know?

104
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,740
That's because the Luling army hasn't arrived yet.

105
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:08,650
General,

106
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:09,400
I apologize for being late.

107
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,130
Please punish me as you see fit.

108
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:13,280
It's fine,

109
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,370
you're here now.

110
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,890
The Emperor has decreed

111
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,210
that in times of war,

112
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,840
if the city's officials perish,

113
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:22,360
all matters within the city

114
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:24,880
shall be temporarily managed by the Luling army.

115
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:27,520
The local magistrate is merely on sick leave,

116
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,160
he hasn't perished.

117
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:30,200
What,

118
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,960
are you defying imperial orders?

119
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:32,960
Release them now!

120
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,120
Fine, fine.

121
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:42,880
Li Yue'an.

122
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:45,900
Do you know the punishment for releasing spies?

123
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,880
It's not your place to question my actions.

124
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,440
I'll bear the consequences.

125
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:55,900
I'd like to see if you can really handle it

126
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,580
when everything falls apart.

127
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,040
You're in charge of the entire Luling army now.

128
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:02,960
It's your call.

129
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:04,620
Really?

130
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,160
Does that work?

131
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:06,690
It works.

132
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,920
Everyone, listen up!

133
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:10,880
Come with me

134
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,360
to rescue my wife.

135
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,040
Let's go!

136
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,120
Cricket.

137
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:32,650
Yangtao.

138
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:33,970
Yangtao.

139
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:36,450
Yangtao.

140
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:40,480
Stay back!

141
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:42,159
This place is filled with oil,

142
00:07:42,159 --> 00:07:43,760
he wants to die together with us.

143
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:44,560
Cai Zhisheng,

144
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:45,680
release Yang Tao.

145
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:48,240
You really came.

146
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,280
What exactly do you want?

147
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,400
What do I want?

148
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,680
You've been investigating for so long,

149
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,740
yet you still couldn't figure it out.

150
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,720
I am the Inseparable Heroes.

151
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,440
You?

152
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,560
Then tell us,

153
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:04,800
are you the fish,

154
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,000
or the bird,

155
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:07,810
and where's the female one?

156
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,640
Show some respect!

157
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,680
That was my late wife.

158
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:12,920
Sir,

159
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,960
his wife must have died long ago.

160
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,080
I believe all of this

161
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,280
was done by him alone.

162
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:20,380
Master Cai,

163
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:22,880
you must have planned this for years.

164
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:25,540
You must have already figured out how to escape.

165
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:26,280
So,

166
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,720
release Yang Tao now.

167
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:30,840
Everyone here

168
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:33,169
can pretend we never saw you today.

169
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,299
Chen Yiqu, are you stupid?

170
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,280
If he really is one of the Inseparable Heroes,

171
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:40,120
letting him go won't save us from being implicated.

172
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,200
Does it even matter

173
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:43,450
if we're implicated or not?

174
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,960
We've been trying to clear our names

175
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,890
just to get back to a peaceful life.

176
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:51,060
But if the price for our peaceful life is you,

177
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,620
then it means nothing.

178
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,440
Enough,

179
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,040
stop with all this lovey-dovey talk,

180
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,040
it's disgusting.

181
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:04,660
Master Cai,

182
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,160
what exactly do you want?

183
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:08,880
The city defense map,

184
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,050
we can give it to you.

185
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,920
What I want is

186
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,770
for you all to be buried with me.

187
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,840
You claim you're one of the Inseparable Heroes,

188
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:23,970
as if you really are,

189
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:25,680
who are you kidding?

190
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,810
In the third year of Chengyuan,

191
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,120
when my wife passed away.

192
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:34,880
I swore

193
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,820
to overthrow the Dacheng Nation.

194
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:39,760
In secret,

195
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,840
I established connections with the wolves of Dayun Nation

196
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,240
behind everyone's back.

197
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:45,880
I reported

198
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,220
the list of officials,

199
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,800
local customs,

200
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:50,920
and every detail to them.

201
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,200
In the fourth year of Chengyuan,

202
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:56,360
the city map I measured with my own feet

203
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,560
earned the appreciation of Lord Heluo.

204
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:00,960
He bestowed upon me the title

205
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,490
of the Inseparable Heroes.

206
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:03,560
Since then,

207
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,800
we've maintained a direct line of communication.

208
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:08,720
For decades after that,

209
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,240
I used paper selling as my cover.

210
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:14,370
I drew all the mountains and rivers I traveled

211
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,320
into detailed topographic maps.

212
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:19,360
I helped Dayun Nation

213
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,360
understand the terrain.

214
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:23,620
Especially recently,

215
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,050
with Butcher Zhang.

216
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:25,620
Enough!

217
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:26,800
You old fool,

218
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,010
release them now

219
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:29,770
and I'll spare your life today.

220
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:36,120
This old man's days are numbered anyway.

221
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,400
I just can't bear

222
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:41,880
that the reputation I worked so hard for

223
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:45,410
has been stolen by these two fools,

224
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,400
it's truly unbearable.

225
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,600
I'll wait until

226
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,800
the fall of Dacheng,

227
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,480
when my Great Cloud

228
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,200
will record my legacy.

229
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,400
Foolish dreams.

230
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,980
As long as the Luling Army stands,

231
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,930
your Cloud Nation won't set foot on a single inch of Dacheng territory.

232
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,040
Haven't I already gotten in?

233
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:14,960
Pathetic.

234
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,000
Cricket.

235
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,240
Are you okay?

236
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:56,840
Mr. Cai.

237
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:57,700
Mr. Cai,

238
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,680
what are you standing there for? Help put out the fire.

239
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:00,560
Come on, Mr. Cai.

240
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:01,640
Hurry, put out the fire,

241
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:02,680
preserve the evidence.

242
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:03,360
Mr. Cai.

243
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,300
General, please reconsider!

244
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,980
General, please reconsider!

245
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:22,440
Victory

246
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,880
is achieved through fighting.

247
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:25,880
Merely defending

248
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:27,880
is waiting for death.

249
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,930
I will go with the General tonight.

250
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,640
The young lord speaks wisely.

251
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:38,100
Indeed.

252
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:41,920
Yue'an.

253
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,600
What nonsense are you talking?

254
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,400
A night raid

255
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,800
is something I should do alone.

256
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:50,730
You stay at camp.

257
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,800
His Majesty arranged our marriage

258
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,400
not to make me a widow.

259
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:58,200
Don't even think about going alone!

260
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:02,410
Fine.

261
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,000
Listen to my orders.

262
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:17,920
Quick! Fire!
