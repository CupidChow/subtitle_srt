1
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:48,720
Foot soak time!

2
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:49,920
Skincare time!

3
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,580
What are you doing?

4
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:03,410
Soaking my feet.

5
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:05,319
Health maintenance.

6
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,060
I questioned Zhang Zaiyou today.

7
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:21,970
He did frequently visit the archives before,

8
00:01:22,039 --> 00:01:23,880
and he still spends every day there now.

9
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:26,520
The staff at the archives can all testify to this.

10
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:27,380
He has no motive

11
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,210
and no opportunity either.

12
00:01:30,039 --> 00:01:32,200
So is Old Xing the Inseparable Hero?

13
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:35,960
I've already obtained his files.

14
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:37,600
Once we verify at his hometown,

15
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:38,560
we'll know the truth.

16
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,090
Let's go.

17
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,759
Always together, huh?

18
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:47,810
Perfect.

19
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,080
Let's get them.

20
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:49,520
Wait.

21
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:51,720
Sir,

22
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,039
you can't just

23
00:01:53,039 --> 00:01:55,039
arrest someone without a reason, can you?

24
00:01:55,039 --> 00:01:57,720
Collusion with foreign powers and harboring fugitives.

25
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,120
Do you have any evidence?

26
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:02,450
The corpse in the medical clinic is the evidence.

27
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,220
Take them away.

28
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,640
I'd like to see who dares.

29
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:10,280
Li Yue'an.

30
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:13,680
I am here by imperial order to capture spies.

31
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,600
I am also here by imperial order to protect our kingdom.

32
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:16,840
Wait

33
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,000
just a moment.

34
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:19,200
Sir,

35
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,600
there must be a misunderstanding.

36
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,960
I was the first to discover the wolf in this clinic,

37
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,240
and I sent someone to report it to the authorities.

38
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:25,840
Shaobing,

39
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:27,940
quickly explain to the official!

40
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,130
This matter.

41
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,560
I know nothing about it.

42
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:31,880
You.

43
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,760
You and your wife conspired with the wolf,

44
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:38,079
we have witnesses and evidence,

45
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,760
yet you still dare to deny it.

46
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:40,760
This was dropped when we were

47
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:43,040
investigating leads on the Inseparable Heroes.

48
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,520
Once is coincidence,

49
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:45,840
twice is accident,

50
00:02:46,079 --> 00:02:47,960
but this has happened repeatedly.

51
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,800
Do you take me for a fool?

52
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:50,880
Chang Wuming.

53
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:52,880
This couple

54
00:02:53,079 --> 00:02:54,560
would never betray our Great Cheng.

55
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,320
For these two,

56
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:56,450
I vouch personally.

57
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:58,880
Fine.

58
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:02,120
I'll go fetch the local magistrate now.

59
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,440
When the chief official returns,

60
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,300
we'll see how you can overrule me.

61
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:13,960
What's going on here?

62
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:19,880
Hail!

63
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,200
Young Prince!

64
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,440
Chen Yiqu!

65
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,360
What's going on with you two?

66
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,400
You've made such a mess

67
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:34,400
and can't even clean up after yourselves?

68
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:35,900
Minister Wang,

69
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:39,079
The reason I didn't take immediate action last night

70
00:03:39,079 --> 00:03:40,440
was because before the assassin died,

71
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:41,640
she left behind clues

72
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:42,680
that prove

73
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,860
the Twin Heroes are someone else.

74
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,680
But Cai Zhisheng

75
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,400
has already confessed and been punished, hasn't he?

76
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,260
Minister Wang,

77
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,500
please give us, husband and wife,

78
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,440
a few more days.

79
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,400
We will certainly get to the bottom

80
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,600
of this whole matter.

81
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:00,880
Who knows if you're planning to escape!

82
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,210
Minister Chang,

83
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:05,000
you're standing before the Prince of Luling,

84
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,200
mind your place.

85
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,520
What prince?

86
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,440
His Majesty has already stripped him of his title.

87
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:11,080
His Majesty issued a verbal decree this morning,

88
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,720
acknowledging that the Prince is still alive.

89
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,320
And he helped solve the case of the Jiandié Duo,

90
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:18,200
the Emperor has now decreed to restore his status,

91
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,459
and the imperial edict will arrive soon.

92
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,340
Please calm down, both of you.

93
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,200
Since the young lord already has some leads,

94
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,440
why don't we

95
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,280
give him a few more days?

96
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,620
Give him more time?

97
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,560
Before the imperial edict arrives,

98
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,840
he is nothing.

99
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:35,920
I'll stay.

100
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,050
What did you say?

101
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,360
I said I'll stay.

102
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,060
As long as I'm here,

103
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,320
my husband will investigate the case thoroughly

104
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:46,520
and won't abandon me.

105
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:47,240
No,

106
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,250
Yangtao!

107
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,000
Very well then,

108
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:52,120
officials,

109
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,680
what do you think?

110
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:54,500
Three days.

111
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,260
Within three days,

112
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:58,040
if you can't uncover the truth,

113
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,880
I don't care who you two are,

114
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,240
no one will be able to protect you.

115
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,920
Take Yangtao to prison!

116
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:06,420
Prison!

117
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,440
I'm counting on you,

118
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:10,970
Yangtao!

119
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:11,850
Yangtao!

120
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:15,600
She did it to prevent Chang Wuming from troubling you anymore.

121
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,660
Don't let her down.

122
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,930
But she's only safe when she's with me.

123
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,760
If you really want to save her,

124
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:22,090
solve the case quickly.

125
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,200
No, that's not right.

126
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:39,480
In our interrogation methods, we have a saying:

127
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,640
under severe punishment,

128
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,530
the truth will always come out.

129
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:44,600
Chang Wuming.

130
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,720
If you dare to harm her in any way,

131
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:54,600
I swear,

132
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:57,080
I will use every means at my disposal

133
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,400
to make sure you never recover from this.

134
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,360
The imperial edict hasn't even arrived yet,

135
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,760
and you already dare to threaten me openly.

136
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:04,720
However,

137
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,610
our Surveillance Bureau has its own procedures,

138
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,240
how can we investigate without interrogation?

139
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,040
Chang Wuming,

140
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,600
are you even a man?

141
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,640
If you're going to do something,

142
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,300
stop wasting time with words.

143
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,000
I just haven't decided yet

144
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,960
whether to brand

145
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,120
your body

146
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:25,050
or your face with this hot iron.

147
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,810
The Yang family's young lady is so beautiful.

148
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,840
If I brand your face,

149
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:32,620
I'm afraid the rest of your life would be ruined.

150
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,370
Stop putting on an act here.

151
00:06:35,159 --> 00:06:35,690
Cricket.

152
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:36,460
Go quickly!

153
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,920
He has ulterior motives.

154
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,320
He's just trying to stall you.

155
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:42,180
Let's see how long you can keep up that sharp tongue.

156
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,600
Young Master.

157
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:49,600
No!

158
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:50,720
Cricket!

159
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,280
Cricket.

160
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,080
Cricket.

161
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:04,800
Does it hurt?

162
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,180
Are you in pain?

163
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:07,640
I'm fine.

164
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,400
Chang Wuming,

165
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,720
without the Emperor's direct order,

166
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,840
using force against royal clan members

167
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:16,160
is a capital offense that condemns three generations of your family.

168
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,560
What do you mean, condemn three generations?

169
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,960
You all witnessed what happened.

170
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,160
He ran into me himself.

171
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,290
How is that my fault?

172
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,160
Chang Wuming.

173
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,800
We've tried torture.

174
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,400
That's enough.

175
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:29,240
Sir.

176
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,560
Let's drop it for now.

177
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,320
Let him investigate.

178
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:33,050
He won't find anything anyway.

179
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:34,320
Very well.

180
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,920
I have other cases to attend to.

181
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:36,450
Let's go.

182
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:43,920
My dear.

183
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,170
Don't be afraid.

184
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:48,440
I will come back for you, I promise.

185
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:51,240
No, I'm afraid something will happen to you, Ququ.

186
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,260
Wait for me.

187
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:55,680
Young Master.

188
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:57,210
I'm fine.

189
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:12,850
Cricket.

190
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,930
Are your injuries serious?

191
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:15,800
Just some flesh wounds,

192
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:16,800
nothing serious.

193
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,970
I'm just worried about Yang Tao

194
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,410
being alone in jail.

195
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:21,960
What did that traitor

196
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,280
tell you before he died?

197
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:23,840
Tell me.

198
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,160
I'll investigate for you,

199
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:25,760
and you can

200
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,060
keep Yang Tao company.

201
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:28,940
What could you possibly find out?

202
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:31,860
It doesn't matter,

203
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:33,400
everything will be clear soon,

204
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,929
we'll handle it ourselves.

205
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:35,900
All right then.

206
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,799
When you're done investigating,

207
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:39,530
I'll throw you a welcome party.

208
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:40,919
I have some business to attend to,

209
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:43,039
need to find Lord Wang and get some answers.

210
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:43,679
Let's go ahead.
