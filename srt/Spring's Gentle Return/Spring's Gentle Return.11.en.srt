1
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:44,700
Commander.

2
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:47,880
The Twin Heroes were killed by the Imperial Guards.

3
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:49,880
Wasn't that woman supposed to be a skilled fighter?

4
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:50,320
No.

5
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:52,120
The Imperial Guards let her go.

6
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:52,720
It seems

7
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,400
the owner of Cai's Paper Mill

8
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:55,730
is the real Twin Heroes.

9
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:56,960
How is that possible?

10
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:02,490
Didn't you just remark earlier

11
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:05,280
that your sister was hiding even more than you?

12
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:06,680
We sacrificed so much,

13
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:08,520
Wild Goose and Wolf helped you save her,

14
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:09,780
but what was it all for?

15
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,360
Are you mistaken?

16
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:15,010
This is all the information I have.

17
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,840
The orders from the secret guards can't be delayed any longer.

18
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,970
Be careful not to implicate yourself.

19
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:32,200
Some wild geese have stayed in Cheng State for too long

20
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,530
and actually think they're citizens now.

21
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:37,160
I don't trust her.

22
00:01:38,039 --> 00:01:39,160
Find some of our men

23
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,610
and bring that couple in for questioning.

24
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:39,820
What are you doing?

25
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,920
I got thirsty in the middle of the night,

26
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,380
so I'm boiling some water.

27
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:49,880
Why are you awake?

28
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,520
I have something on my mind,

29
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,480
couldn't sleep.

30
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:55,840
What's bothering you?

31
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,160
Stop looking.

32
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,960
You're boiling my water,

33
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,040
yours is here.

34
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,480
Chen Yiqu's letter.

35
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:23,720
My dear.

36
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:24,740
I was wrong,

37
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:28,400
there will never be any divorce papers again in this lifetime.

38
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,680
The missing one is mine,

39
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,880
yours is still there.

40
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,090
I don't care,

41
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,400
I can't forget about this,

42
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,460
I can't get over it.

43
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,810
If you can't get over it,

44
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,810
what do you want me to do?

45
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,020
Let's have a fight.

46
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:47,660
My dear,

47
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,760
don't say I didn't warn you,

48
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,200
now that my memory has returned,

49
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,400
my martial arts skills

50
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,060
seem to have returned as well.

51
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:56,420
Do you really want to fight me?

52
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:57,700
Really?

53
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:58,620
Really.

54
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:02,120
Chen Yiqu.

55
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:03,720
Chen Yiqu.

56
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,640
Chen Yiqu.

57
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,500
You dare to fight back?

58
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,399
Chen Yiqu.

59
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:21,200
I didn't.

60
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:55,120
Sir.

61
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:58,320
Sir.

62
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:03,120
What is it?

63
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,040
I wanted to ask,

64
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:07,200
now that Cai Zhisheng has confessed and been punished,

65
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,000
is this case considered closed?

66
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,400
What do you think?

67
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:14,280
I... I think...

68
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,520
Do you believe

69
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,640
that Cai Zhisheng

70
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,520
is the Inseparable Duo?

71
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,200
I think...

72
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:25,120
Well?

73
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,360
If you don't think so, sir,

74
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,160
then he isn't.

75
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,840
You were quite decisive when you wanted to close the case,

76
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:32,440
but now

77
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,170
you can't make up your mind?

78
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,400
As officials of the court,

79
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,330
we must follow proper procedures.

80
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:40,320
Don't give me that nonsense.

81
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,780
If he hadn't burned himself to death,

82
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:46,250
I could have gotten more information.

83
00:06:47,159 --> 00:06:47,760
Forget it.

84
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:50,760
Since Cai Zhisheng has confessed

85
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,300
and paid with his life,

86
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,440
I'll just report it as is.

87
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:55,800
Yes, sir.

88
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:57,860
By the way, sir,

89
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:00,480
the men have been working hard these days.

90
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:01,780
I was thinking,

91
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,000
perhaps I could take them out

92
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,460
to celebrate our success?

93
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:08,360
Everyone has indeed worked hard lately,

94
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:09,290
go ahead.

95
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:10,760
Yes, sir.

96
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,020
Yang Family Clinic is reopening!

97
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:34,130
Half-price consultations today!

98
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:36,600
Don't miss this opportunity!

99
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:37,620
Isn't she one of

100
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,520
the Inseparable Duo?

101
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,560
The authorities have proven our innocence.

102
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:43,290
We are not the Inseparable Duo.

103
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,050
Who would believe that?

104
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,360
Let's go, let's go,

105
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,360
let's move along.

106
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:51,040
Who would seek treatment from her?

107
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:53,600
Yang Family Clinic reopens today!

108
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:56,360
Ladies and gentlemen, don't miss out!

109
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:57,920
Half price for everyone!

110
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:58,920
Everyone.

111
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:04,800
Is this it?

112
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:05,800
Yes.

113
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:08,410
You're definitely in the right place,

114
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,380
please come in, ma'am.

115
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:15,640
Please come in quickly, ma'am.

116
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:17,120
Doctor Yang will be here shortly.

117
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,240
Please wait inside.

118
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,280
Form a line.

119
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:21,100
Come on.

120
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:21,920
Yang Family Clinic,

121
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,000
please, please come!

122
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:23,880
Please!

123
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,880
Yang Family Clinic! Even if you're not sick,

124
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:26,600
come get checked anyway!

125
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,240
You understand?

126
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,500
Do you know where to go?

127
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,320
Yang Family Clinic!

128
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:31,760
Come get checked even if you're healthy!

129
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:32,890
Yang Family Clinic!

130
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:33,679
Thank you.

131
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,960
Thank you, everyone, for your support!

132
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:37,159
Thank you for your support.

133
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:38,090
It's just ahead.

134
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,120
Mr. Huang.

135
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,200
Mr. Huang.

136
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,480
Mr. Huang is on leave.

137
00:08:42,679 --> 00:08:43,240
Mr. Yang.

138
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,600
Mr. Yang is out on field duty.

139
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,280
Young Yang is here today though.

140
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,440
Zhang has perfect attendance this month.

141
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:51,970
Alright.

142
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,320
Everyone dismissed.

143
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:55,180
Dismissed.

144
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:57,840
Chief.

145
00:08:58,960 --> 00:08:59,820
Sorry I'm late.

146
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,040
The Inseparable Duo.

147
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,000
The Inseparable Duo have been executed on the spot.

148
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,200
This is now the Young Master.

149
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,730
Weren't you there that day?

150
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,920
You two go patrol the streets now.

151
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:09,450
Let's go.

152
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:12,730
Let's go.

153
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:14,600
Chief.

154
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:15,930
I'm really sorry

155
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,160
for being late today.

156
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:18,480
Young Master,

157
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:19,610
how's your head?

158
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:22,440
Just call me Cricket,

159
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,120
I've

160
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:25,380
been demoted to commoner status.

161
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:27,400
It's not every day I get a Young Master as my assistant,

162
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,860
you have to let me enjoy it.

163
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:30,680
For the next few days,

164
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:32,010
I'm giving you time off.

165
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:33,770
I can't accept this.

166
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:34,640
The men

167
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:35,960
haven't adjusted to the situation yet.

168
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,240
After these few days pass,

169
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:37,840
you can come back.

170
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:38,560
I really can't accept this,

171
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,160
Everyone needs time to adjust.

172
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:40,640
okay?

173
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,680
This is embarrassing for me.

174
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:44,280
Enough, listen to my advice,

175
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,760
go home and get some rest.

176
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:49,040
Then I'll finish this matter first,

177
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:52,170
and I'll pay you back as soon as I get next month's salary.

178
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:52,960
Thank you.

179
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:53,840
Young Master,

180
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:55,200
I've

181
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:58,140
carefully considered what you said yesterday.

182
00:09:58,880 --> 00:09:59,480
Princess,

183
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:01,050
I have something to report.

184
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,440
What could you possibly have to report?

185
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:02,970
Cricket,

186
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,930
have you finished the tasks I assigned you today?

187
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:08,800
For your great kindness,

188
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,040
I'll devote the rest of my life to you.

189
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:10,760
Get out of here.

190
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:11,560
Go patrol

191
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:12,640
the streets,

192
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:13,320
we're going now.

193
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,120
Young Master.

194
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:14,760
Princess.

195
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:16,360
Please come into the office for a chat.

196
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:17,360
The magistrate is still ill,

197
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,720
I am your superior now,

198
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:19,720
how dare you stop me?

199
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,760
I was just about to report on this matter,

200
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:22,820
Linan is in danger.

201
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:30,400
Xing Dezheng.

202
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:33,360
Don't think I don't know you're covering for Zhao Jian.

203
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,220
What Zhao Jian?

204
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,240
You mean the cricket?

205
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,280
We're concerned about the people of Linan.

206
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,680
Save your breath. Get up.

207
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,800
Princess, forced melons aren't sweet,

208
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,660
and forced seedlings don't grow,

209
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,410
so please stop bothering them.

210
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,280
Don't think I don't know

211
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:51,280
about your little crush on Yang Tao.

212
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,980
I'm happy when I see the person I care about is happy.

213
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,580
If he's not mine, I won't be happy.

214
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,740
Perfect. Since you know them,

215
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:02,860
tell me about them,

216
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,080
especially Yang Tao.

217
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,200
Princess.

218
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:09,120
Princess,

219
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,760
it was four years ago,

220
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,240
when a thunderclap shook the sky,

221
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,500
and the cricket made its grand entrance.

222
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,000
Let's talk inside.
