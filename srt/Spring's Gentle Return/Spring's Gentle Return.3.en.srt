1
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:55,760
Boss,

2
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:57,360
there's nothing here,

3
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:58,400
not even anything valuable.

4
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:00,000
Boss, I've got nothing here.

5
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,400
This candle is still burning,

6
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:02,400
they can't be far.

7
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:03,100
You go east,

8
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:03,900
you go west,

9
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,519
and search thoroughly.

10
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:06,050
Yes, sir.

11
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:08,210
Let's go.

12
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:09,160
You two

13
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,090
come with me.

14
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:10,570
Move.

15
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:13,720
Follow me.

16
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:14,650
Hurry up!

17
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:15,250
This way.

18
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:24,370
Come out now,

19
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,200
they're gone.

20
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:31,890
Come out.

21
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:37,520
Boss,

22
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,960
why didn't you turn us in?

23
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:42,120
Because I believe

24
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,050
you didn't do it.

25
00:01:45,039 --> 00:01:45,920
That's right.

26
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:48,640
Those two guards

27
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,080
were killed with knives.

28
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,740
Yang Tao always fights with his fists

29
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:53,840
and never uses knives.

30
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:54,280
And I

31
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,479
don't know any martial arts.

32
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:57,680
Besides, we would never

33
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,800
kill someone in a place

34
00:01:58,800 --> 00:01:59,560
where people know us.

35
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,690
So I want to know what really happened.

36
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:03,840
Boss.

37
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,360
I'm afraid we've been mistaken for

38
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:09,620
scapegoats for those foreign spies, the Inseparable Duo.

39
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:13,240
What the hell are these 'Inseparable Duo' anyway?

40
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,960
Young Yangtao did the right thing.

41
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:21,040
There are so many spies gathering intelligence in Dacheng,

42
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,079
and none survive once they fall into Hou Wei's hands.

43
00:02:23,079 --> 00:02:24,400
You should leave quickly.

44
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,440
But if we leave,

45
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,040
we won't be able to prove our innocence.

46
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,440
He might even know about my past.

47
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:30,079
Leave proving your innocence to me.

48
00:02:30,079 --> 00:02:30,640
Go now,

49
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,010
or it'll be too late.

50
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,520
I'm not well-educated,

51
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,760
and I have all sorts of health problems.

52
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,920
Yangtao has taken good care of me all these years.

53
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,180
She even saved my life.

54
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,050
Take this money,

55
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,200
it's not much.

56
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,040
How do you have so much money?

57
00:02:47,079 --> 00:02:48,740
I was saving it to get married.

58
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,160
You have about four hours before they lock the city gates.

59
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,440
Once you exit the South Gate, head west,

60
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,800
and take the small paths, not the main road.

61
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,720
If you make it past that mountain before dark,

62
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,720
no one will be able to catch up with you.

63
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:59,520
The wanted notice -

64
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:02,080
I'll try to delay issuing it until after the fifth watch.

65
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:02,680
Boss.

66
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,240
Stop crying, let's go.

67
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:07,880
Hurry up.

68
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,440
This is as far as I can help you.

69
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:09,840
Boss.

70
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:13,170
No words can express my gratitude.

71
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,890
Alright, get going now.

72
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,120
Go.

73
00:03:22,079 --> 00:03:22,540
My dear.

74
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,440
This mountain path is too steep.

75
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,240
My dear, wait.

76
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:27,920
What's wrong?

77
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,360
I left in such a hurry,

78
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,360
I must have forgotten my exam notes.

79
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,520
Are you out of your mind?

80
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,640
We're about to die and you're still thinking about exams.

81
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:35,040
My brain is actually sick,

82
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:35,900
the doctor said

83
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:36,640
I must

84
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:37,480
memorize everything well.

85
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:37,940
Shut up.

86
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,400
Don't make me hit you right here.

87
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,200
What are you laughing at?

88
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,720
Why didn't you warn me when you saw it?

89
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,240
Why weren't you watching where you were going?

90
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,440
If you saw it, you should have warned me.

91
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,480
Why do you want a divorce from me?

92
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,600
When did I say I wanted a divorce?

93
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,440
I never gave you divorce papers, did I?

94
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:10,840
But you've already been thinking about it.

95
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:11,640
Chen Yiqu.

96
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,360
Did I do something wrong?

97
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,600
Is my cooking not good enough?

98
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,240
Or do you blame me for my bad temper?

99
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:21,700
Or is it because I couldn't cure your headaches in three years?

100
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,600
Or do you not love me anymore?

101
00:04:37,159 --> 00:04:38,480
Don't think that by acting this way,

102
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,600
I'll forgive you.

103
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:41,800
If we weren't running for our lives.

104
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,200
I'm not done with you yet.

105
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,200
Don't go! Put me down!

106
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,290
Don't leave!

107
00:04:47,159 --> 00:04:47,760
My dear!

108
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:49,480
Put me down!

109
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:50,600
My dear!

110
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:58,720
My dear!

111
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:01,480
My dear!

112
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:04,080
I'm sorry! I was wrong, truly wrong!

113
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,880
I really didn't mean it that way.

114
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,960
Let's hurry and leave.

115
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,440
If the officers catch up with us,

116
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,060
we won't be able to escape.

117
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,440
Are you okay?

118
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,400
The road ahead

119
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,760
will only get more difficult.

120
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,000
My dear.

121
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,720
I really didn't mean it that way.

122
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,440
I'm hungry.

123
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:33,360
In a few more hours,

124
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,659
Li's wonton stall should be open, right?

125
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,280
I'm hungry too.

126
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,770
Li's wontons are great,

127
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,400
the broth isn't too greasy.

128
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,560
We can brew some tea.

129
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,040
Later we can get some wontons

130
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,000
and some vinegar and ginger.

131
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,530
Let's forget about eating,

132
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:49,240
saving our lives is more important.

133
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:49,760
Wait.

134
00:05:51,159 --> 00:05:52,080
Let's go back.

135
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,840
Not for wontons,

136
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,920
but to catch the real culprits.

137
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:57,720
Think about it.

138
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,850
If we catch the real Mandarin Duck Duo,

139
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,960
wouldn't that prove our innocence?

140
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,880
You're such a genius.

141
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,570
Why should we leave?

142
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,680
We're not the Mandarin Duck Duo anyway,

143
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:08,720
we're completely innocent.

144
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,720
Maybe if we go back,

145
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,480
you might even recover your lost memories.

146
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,920
Yes, and think about this.

147
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:15,080
If we can catch the real Mandarin Duck Duo,

148
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,410
we'll get a huge reward.

149
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,240
Once we're rich and successful,

150
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,840
you won't need to run a clinic anymore, and I...

151
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,720
No wonder they call you a genius.

152
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,680
Chen Yiqu, oh Chen Yiqu.

153
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,600
Not to mention the whole city is hunting us down

154
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,000
and we can't move an inch.

155
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,200
Just the two of us

156
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,400
trying to catch the Twin Heroes.

157
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,210
You're so naive.

158
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,440
What would you do without me?

159
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,360
Spies have escaped from Lin'an.

160
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,080
All travelers

161
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:11,400
must remain here for three days

162
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:12,920
for inspection.

163
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:15,490
If you see these two people,

164
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,020
confirm their identities

165
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,570
and kill them immediately.

166
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:39,940
Who are you?

167
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,120
Don't come any closer!

168
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,080
I've decided to become an outlaw

169
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,940
Will you be my bandit husband?

170
00:07:52,159 --> 00:07:54,120
Whatever I have, you'll have too.

171
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:55,480
Fine.

172
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:57,650
I just...

173
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:01,000
I've checked the roads out of town.

174
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,460
We probably can't get out.

175
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,820
Let's follow your plan

176
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,360
and go back to investigate.

177
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,160
After all, the most dangerous place

178
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,290
might be the safest.

179
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,480
How can we go back?

180
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:13,040
With your amateur disguise skills,

181
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,220
will that work?

182
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,320
I have

183
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,420
two fake death pills passed down from my ancestors.

184
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:21,680
We could give them two corpses instead.

185
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,140
Let's stick with the disguises then.

186
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,620
Let's change clothes.

187
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:32,840
Looks relaxed but actually tight security.

188
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,679
The number of guards hasn't increased,

189
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:36,280
but they've added more constables.

190
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:37,480
We need to be careful.

191
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:39,890
Look at that notice.

192
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,400
Good thing we disguised ourselves.

193
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,560
Look at the one next to it.

194
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,000
Isn't that you?

195
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:55,720
How can it look so similar?

196
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:56,440
How would I know?

197
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,360
It's obviously you.

198
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,680
That one's obviously you too.

199
00:08:58,680 --> 00:08:59,800
Let's just play it by ear.

200
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,160
How are we supposed to do that?

201
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:01,680
They're almost up to us.

202
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:02,680
Keep your head down.

203
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:03,610
Lower your head.

204
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:07,280
Eat.

205
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:18,520
It's so spicy!

206
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:21,380
Look up.

207
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:22,240
Brother,

208
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,040
what's happening to us?

209
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,280
Brother.

210
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,280
What's that smell?

211
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,610
What are you doing here?

212
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:28,080
Sir.

213
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,200
This is my brother,

214
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,680
he has some issues,

215
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,000
we're going to the city to see a doctor.

216
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,120
Would you like some candied haws, sir?

217
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:34,650
Let's go.

218
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:35,440
Hurry.

219
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:36,660
Thank you, sir.

220
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:47,580
You're quite adaptable, aren't you?

221
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,720
Desperate times call for desperate measures,

222
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,380
a gentleman must be flexible.

223
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,000
That smells strong!

224
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Stay away from me.

225
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,740
So where are we going next?

226
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,320
Say something.

227
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:05,530
Did you leave your vocal cords at home?

228
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:06,600
I can talk now.

229
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,320
Even the most tangled thread

230
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,250
has a beginning.

231
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:12,560
What thread?

232
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,480
Hele Restaurant.

233
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,440
Despite how lazy you all are,

234
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:33,200
I'm surprised how clean the scene is.

235
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:34,960
I hate to say this,

236
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,660
but I actually wish

237
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:38,760
they'd kept their usual work habits

238
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,010
and left some crucial evidence for us.

239
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,690
There's no evidence at all.

240
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:02,640
No,

241
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:05,140
the evidence has been cleaned up.

242
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,360
What else?

243
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,600
Even traces of the chief's search

244
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,220
have been wiped clean.

245
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,120
So you're saying

246
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,720
the Inseparable Duo is back?

247
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:17,720
Who's that?
