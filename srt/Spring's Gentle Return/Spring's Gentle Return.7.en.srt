1
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,660
I get tired after just a few steps,

2
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,520
I can't even tie up a chicken,

3
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:51,620
so how could I possibly kill someone?

4
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:55,200
Sir,

5
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:56,880
I'm truly sorry,

6
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,040
my wife and I were falsely accused

7
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:00,240
of being enemy spies,

8
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:02,280
we were desperate for a chance to survive,

9
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:04,010
that's why we resorted to this.

10
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,140
I apologize for my rudeness earlier,

11
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:07,540
please forgive me.

12
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:12,160
The Inseparable Heroes.

13
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:15,160
This...

14
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,160
These arrest warrants

15
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:21,340
have already been distributed everywhere.

16
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:26,530
Tell me about it,

17
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,330
this old man has always loved stories.

18
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:40,200
General.

19
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,560
You must deliver this letter to Colonel Wang,

20
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:44,960
whether we can rescue the young lord

21
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,490
depends on this one action.

22
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,009
I can't believe such a thing happened.

23
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,730
You've heard the story now,

24
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,600
so it's time to hand over the purchase list.

25
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:05,880
Your temperament

26
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,800
is exactly like my late wife's.

27
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,240
The bookshelf behind you,

28
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:13,570
the last three books on the first shelf are

29
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,460
Yuan dynasty paper is very precious.

30
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,360
But over time,

31
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:27,800
I've acquired quite a collection.

32
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:31,079
These three are from the past two years.

33
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,880
If what you two say is true,

34
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:37,520
that the Inseparable Heroes have been hiding for years,

35
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:40,079
we should probably look further back.

36
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,340
How far back do we need to look?

37
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,930
That's your business then.

38
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,280
I hope

39
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,730
you can give us some guidance, sir.

40
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,320
This paper

41
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,120
is crucial.

42
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:01,920
On this paper

43
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:03,640
there are characters

44
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:04,640
and...

45
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,640
What are you doing?

46
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:17,840
This is a clue.

47
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,200
This paper

48
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,520
after being scorched by fire,

49
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,520
has a burnt smell

50
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:27,210
that has masked the original scent of the ink.

51
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,079
You can even taste that?

52
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,680
Based on different ink-making materials,

53
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:34,280
ink can basically be categorized as pine soot ink or oil soot ink.

54
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:35,820
It's pine soot.

55
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:42,440
A faint scent of borneol and musk.

56
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:46,000
Long-lasting fragrant pine soot ink.

57
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,360
So what about this long-lasting fragrant pine soot ink?

58
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,880
Long-lasting fragrant pine soot ink

59
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:51,480
is exclusively used by government officials.

60
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,400
Are you saying

61
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,570
it's from a government office?

62
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,720
Thank you for your hospitality these past few days.

63
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:09,520
Let me persuade you one more time

64
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:11,120
to stay and make paper for me.

65
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,490
Once things quiet down,

66
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,440
I'll help you leave the city,

67
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,240
at least saving your lives.

68
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,600
I appreciate your kindness.

69
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:22,600
However,

70
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,520
as long as this case remains unsolved,

71
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:25,600
I cannot rest easy.

72
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,200
I actually think this Mr. Cai

73
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,659
is quite a passionate man.

74
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,200
I feel like he's hiding something from us.

75
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:47,560
In Yun Kingdom, earring numbers like 3, 5, 7, and 9

76
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,490
represent social status and rank.

77
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:53,720
His late wife

78
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,730
must have held a high position in Yun Kingdom.

79
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,800
Merchants in the past were just like that,

80
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,130
traveling far and wide,

81
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,920
marrying into families of high officials in Yun Kingdom

82
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,580
to gain business advantages.

83
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,280
I just feel

84
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:08,300
there's something off about him.

85
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:11,680
Now that you mention it, I also have a feeling

86
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,720
that my memory loss

87
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,650
might be connected to all this.

88
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,760
I can't figure it out.

89
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,420
Let's focus on the case first.

90
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,360
Where are you going?

91
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:27,660
I'm going to

92
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,560
storm the magistrate's office.

93
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,680
Haven't you learned your lesson yet?

94
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:35,080
Next time you won't just be making paper here.

95
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,540
Then give me a better idea.

96
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:38,970
Ask for help,

97
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,370
find the constable.

98
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,520
If there really is a spy in the magistrate's office,

99
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,050
how do you know it's not him?

100
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,159
You saved his life,

101
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,240
and he constantly talks about you,

102
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,680
singing your praises.

103
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,440
You're afraid I'll get him in trouble, aren't you?

104
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,560
Are you crazy?

105
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,160
I don't think you have amnesia at all,

106
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,020
you're just mentally disturbed.

107
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:08,020
At times like this, you can only trust yourself.

108
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:51,240
Come out!

109
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,120
Don't make me use force.

110
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:55,280
Boss,

111
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,140
it's me.

112
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,280
Didn't I tell you to leave?

113
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,360
Why are you back?

114
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,320
Where's Yang Tao?

115
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,640
But if we leave now,

116
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,080
we'll never clear our names.

117
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,640
You think coming back will clear your name?

118
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:10,770
Risking execution,

119
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:12,720
you must have...

120
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,720
found something?

121
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,760
There are enemy spies

122
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,580
in our government office.

123
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:22,760
I know.

124
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,340
How do you know?

125
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,120
The Inseparable Heroes,

126
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,780
that's you guys, isn't it?

127
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,170
No, I'm not one of the Inseparable Heroes.

128
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:38,120
I'm talking about the real Inseparable Heroes,

129
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:38,880
or at least one of them,

130
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,680
who has infiltrated our office.

131
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:41,800
You mean

132
00:07:42,159 --> 00:07:43,220
you want me to check

133
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:45,380
when everyone started working here?

134
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,520
But we don't need to check everyone,

135
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:49,040
because

136
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,659
they lost contact with their handler

137
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:54,120
sometime before my wedding.

138
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,720
Doesn't that make me the prime suspect?

139
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,320
I also joined four years ago.

140
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,000
No, no, no,

141
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,180
it can't be you.

142
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,960
I've seen the note,

143
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,120
the handwriting is elegant and neat,

144
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,180
must be from someone well-educated.

145
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:06,920
You're insulting me, aren't you?

146
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,050
You'll pay for this.

147
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:26,480
Come out,

148
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,960
you've been following me all night.

149
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:36,240
Yangtao.

150
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,840
Your cautious habit

151
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,280
hasn't changed a bit.

152
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:42,159
And your sneaky ways

153
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,600
haven't changed either?

154
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,320
This note,

155
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:47,040
you wrote it, didn't you?

156
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:56,240
This case has gotten way too big.

157
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:57,640
Don't forget,

158
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,320
you used to be a secret guard.

159
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,440
You didn't kill me today,

160
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,840
which means you've bought me some time.

161
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:09,160
Could you help me with one more favor?

162
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:10,360
Don't push your luck.

163
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:12,400
After two days,

164
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,800
there will be no friendship between us,

165
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,130
only swords and blades.

166
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,930
Well, we still have two days, don't we?

167
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,320
Breaking into the magistrate's office at night,

168
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,160
how dare you!

169
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:40,640
Guards!

170
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:41,640
There's an assassin!

171
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:42,800
Assassin!

172
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:44,050
Seize the assassin!

173
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,730
Take the items away.

174
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:07,520
Arrest her.

175
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,240
Before dealing with external threats, we must ensure internal stability.

176
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:18,970
If you ask me,

177
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:21,490
you should stay out of official business.

178
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:27,440
What's wrong?

179
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,320
What are you thinking about?

180
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:35,320
Come.

181
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,920
You're really starving,

182
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,280
and Yang Tao has such a sweet tooth,

183
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:40,680
he must be suffering too.

184
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:42,920
Boss.

185
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:45,210
Where did you get

186
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:46,440
these two letters from?

187
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,320
Found them on the dead guard's body.

188
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,760
When I saw they belonged to you two,

189
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:50,960
I didn't turn them in.

190
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,900
This one doesn't seem to be my letter.

191
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:00,800
Why are you crying?

192
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:03,720
So

193
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,480
Yangtao wants a divorce too.

194
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,720
Listen to your brother's advice,

195
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:10,720
stop investigating,

196
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,850
find a nice place to live with Yangtao,

197
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,200
and I can visit you both when I have time.

198
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,770
Yangtao has been arrested.

199
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,200
Who are you?

200
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:26,530
Let's go.

201
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:32,560
The Inseparable Heroes.

202
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,040
Finally caught you.

203
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:35,280
Tell me,

204
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:36,800
are you the first hero

205
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,080
or the second one?

206
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:39,880
I've already told you,

207
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:42,640
I'm also looking for clues about the Inseparable Heroes.

208
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:44,840
It doesn't matter if you won't confess.

209
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:46,380
Once I catch your partner,

210
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,040
I'll let you experience

211
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:49,640
my imperial guard's interrogation techniques.

212
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:51,300
No one can resist confessing.

213
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,800
Treating them to the finest food and drink,

214
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:59,660
keeping them plump and well-fed.

215
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:02,860
Wolf Chief,

216
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,040
news has arrived from our messenger:

217
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,000
the Twin Heroes

218
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,960
have been captured by the authorities.

219
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:08,820
Useless fools.

220
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,240
Gather all our wolf brothers.

221
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,970
The Twin Heroes, dead or alive,

222
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:17,140
must not remain in official custody.

223
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:36,400
I've found out everything.

224
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,720
The magistrate's office is in complete chaos.

225
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,650
Chang Wuming is leading all his men

226
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:41,280
to hunt this person down.

227
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:44,640
I knew I shouldn't have helped with this.

228
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:45,770
What about Yang Tao?

229
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:46,930
How is she doing now?

230
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,120
Yang Tao is safe for now,

231
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,450
locked up in the prison.

232
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:50,640
Do you have any ideas?

233
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:51,440
Let's hear it.

234
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:52,640
I would go through hell

235
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:54,170
and high water for you both.

236
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,040
Prison break.

237
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,640
I said I'd go through hell and high water,

238
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:58,600
but you're asking me

239
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,460
to get my entire family executed!

240
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:02,960
Tell us your plan.

241
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:04,880
Fine.

242
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,360
Count me in.
