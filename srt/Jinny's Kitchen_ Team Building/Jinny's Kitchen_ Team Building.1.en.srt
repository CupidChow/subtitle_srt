- Yu-mi?

117
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:48,550
So who reported it?

118
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:53,300
Well we all meet occasionally in private.

119
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:55,150
How many times have we met up?

120
00:05:55,550 --> 00:05:57,550
About 3 times?

121
00:05:58,150 --> 00:06:03,150
For example, if the boss suggests a meet up, what happens?

122
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:05,850
- There's a group chat.
- So by text.

123

124

125
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:17,750
Well he asks for everyone's schedule. What about this day? That day?

126
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:21,150
Then he does communicate.

127

128
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:25,800

139

00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:06,700

143

144
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:20,600

00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:41,500
Wait,

179
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:45,850
I've never met him before.

180
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:47,450
Shake his hand,

181
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,100
For your information, we're the same age,

182
00:09:57,850 --> 00:09:59,150
And we're both CEOs,

183
00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:05,000
Let's briefly hear our EiC CEO's words of encouragement and he'll hand over the prize.

184
00:10:06,050 --> 00:10:09,900
Since you're filming today under the god of communication concept,

185
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:13,150
I've brought a necessary item if you're going to communicate.

186
00:10:12,770 --> 00:10:14,640
[Whisky]

187
00:10:14,650 --> 00:10:18,900
I hope you bring up everything you've kept inside, with the help of this,

188
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:20,550
And communicate well,

189
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:23,050
- I see.
- And CEO Lee,

190
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:24,900
Keep an open mind.

191
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:28,150
- I see, I see.
- Why are you just-

192
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:27,040
[Cash Gift]

193
00:10:38,650 --> 00:10:39,700
Have fun.

194
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:42,250
Thank you. Thank you.

195
00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:48,900
Our guest's words and gift presentation is over,

196
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:52,500
Egg is Coming's CEO, Rhee Myung-han-

197
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:53,350
Keep a hold of this.

198
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,350
Me?

199
00:10:57,270 --> 00:10:59,730
[12:00: Game for lunch]

200
00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:03,000
First, I need to tell you where we're going.

201
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:05,650
EiC has a training institute in Goseong.

202
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:07,450
- Goseong?
- I've seen it.

203
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:09,400
We're going to spend a night there,

204
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:12,750
Play a load of games, eat some delicious food, and have lots of fun.

205
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:25,150
But it's no fun to just go. After all, we're here to have fun.

206
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:28,400
So we've prepared some tasty games for the road while we go.

207
00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:34,200
In the middle, we're going to have lunch in Chuncheon.

208
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:35,600
Dakgalbi.

209
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:40,350
We've found a place that does an amazing charcoal dakgalbi, so we'll have that for lunch.

210
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:50,850
But not everyone will be eating.

211
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,650
Are only the winners of the game eating?

212
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:59,700
So the winners will obviously eat dakgalbi.

213
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:02,800
- And the losers,
- What will they eat?

214
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:07,200
The losers will do a good job grilling the dakgalbi.

215
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,200
Wow, that's so nice.

216
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:14,250
Employees vs interns.

217
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:19,600
Your teamwork. How well you cooperate with each other to complete the mission.

218
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:24,100
- Through a game,
- Are you splitting us up?

219
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:24,750
That's right.

220
00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:28,250
Team building he says.

221
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:29,750
And then he splits us up right from the get go.

222
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:31,150
No, hear me out! Hear me out!

223
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:33,450
First, build your teamwork in smaller groups,

224
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:36,200
And then you'll come together and build your teamwork all together.

225
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:38,750
But we're an odd number.

226
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:39,600
Right.

227
00:12:39,950 --> 00:12:41,350
Don't you need to even us out?

228
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:46,300
We've prepared provisions for that on a case by case basis.

229
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:48,400
But how is 4 vs 1 fair?

230
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:58,650
See E1 of Jinny's Kitchen to see the origin of this joke

231
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:55,580
Choi Woo-shik | Employee?

232
00:12:58,650 --> 00:12:59,800
Will you be alright 1 vs 4?

233
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:09,800
So, the communication amongst the employees, and amongst the interns,

234
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:12,750
We'll figure that out first before we do everyone all together.

235
00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:14,500
There's already disharmony in this team.

236
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:17,600
Maybe, but you're still a team.

237
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:22,000
Alright, so let me explain simply.

238
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:25,900
We'll play one game here, and the team that finishes first can go.

239
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:30,450
Oh we're taking different cars?

240
00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:31,100
Of course.

241
00:13:31,650 --> 00:13:33,350
If you go downstairs, there are two cars.

242
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:41,540
[The team that wins the first mission gets to choose their car]

243
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:45,410
[Driving your own cars, complete the missions]

244
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:49,210
[Only the team that arrives at the dakgalbi restaurant first]

245
00:13:49,610 --> 00:13:52,970
[Gets to eat charcoal grilled dakgalbi]

246
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:55,350
Then, shall I explain the first game?

247
00:13:55,850 --> 00:13:57,950
The first game is the signal quiz.

248
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:01,250
What's that?

249
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:04,750
You know the music that plays at the start of shows?

250
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:05,550
For example,

251
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:11,670
[Listen to the music that plays in the opening sequence]

252
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:15,970
[And guess the name of the program]

253
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,500
It's not just television programs.

254
00:14:21,450 --> 00:14:24,900
In everyday life there are numerous musical tones that play.

255
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:25,900
Like the sound of a traffic light?

256
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,000
This is a practise question.

257
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,600
Say "Answer".

258
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:36,650
Answer!

259
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:37,750
Subway.

260
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,050
Answer!

261
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:40,950
Washing Machine.

262
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:42,050
Correct.

263
00:14:42,050 --> 00:14:44,550
- What washing machine?
- What washing machine is it though?

264
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:45,500
What?

265
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,150
Answer. LG Tromm?

266
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:50,950
Correct!

267
00:14:51,650 --> 00:14:52,700
That far?

268
00:14:57,650 --> 00:14:58,750
But there's only two of you here, right?

269
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,100
Decide now who will answer 2 questions.

270
00:15:02,450 --> 00:15:03,800
Tae-hyung will do it.

271
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:04,800
Tae-hyung has to answer 2.

272
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:09,900
Let's go. The first question.

273
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:20,350
Answer!

274
00:15:22,450 --> 00:15:23,250
Wrong. That's not it.

275
00:15:31,650 --> 00:15:32,700
Oh, is it that?

276
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:35,650
The one where they go on the unicorn.

277
00:15:35,650 --> 00:15:36,500
Yeah, that one.

278
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,600
This team has the right to answer. 5 more seconds.

279
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,900
I'll play it again.

280
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:43,150
They go on the unicorn and pay money.

281
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:44,400
Yeah, I know what you mean.

282
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:45,200
Answer!

283
00:15:46,450 --> 00:15:48,700
Unicorn? .

284
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:52,550
Wrong. You asked the wrong question.

285
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:55,450
Oh really?

286
00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:02,050
I can't think of it.

287
00:16:02,050 --> 00:16:02,950
Can we pass it?

288
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:05,000
Shall I give you all a hint?

289
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:10,000
This is for everyone. Here it is.

290
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:13,350
Answer!

291
00:16:14,450 --> 00:16:15,350
Tae-hyung?

292
00:16:16,650 --> 00:16:17,550
.

293
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:19,500
The exact title. 3, 2, 1.

294
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:20,850
.

295
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:22,250
Correct.

296
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:26,850
Oh, .

297
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:34,100
You, seriously.

298
00:16:34,950 --> 00:16:36,000
Oi, Choi Woo-shik.

299
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,950
It's already annoying.

300
00:16:39,650 --> 00:16:41,050
Tae-hyung needs to get another one.

301
00:16:41,850 --> 00:16:44,000
- He's so annoying.
- Nice.

302
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:47,050
That was hard.

303
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:55,150
Answer!

304
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:56,850
.

305
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:59,100
Correct!

306
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:13,000
In that case, Woo-shik please stand up and go to the back.

307
00:17:13,150 --> 00:17:15,900
If Tae-hyung answers one more question correctly, this team can leave.

308
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:17,200
We're in trouble.

309
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:21,550
This team can't leave until everyone gets a question right.

310
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,400
Next up.

311
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:34,200
This is a sound you hear in everyday life.

312
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:37,400
In everyday life?

313
00:17:41,050 --> 00:17:43,350
I've never heard this before. In everday life?

314
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,200
Lee Seo-jin should know this.

315
00:17:54,550 --> 00:17:56,400
Are you giving him a hint?

316
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,650
He's the opposing team though.

317
00:17:59,150 --> 00:18:00,650
Just to get in the boss's good favour.

318
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:04,450
But what does that have to do with this?

319
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:05,800
Try it, try it.

320
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:08,350
Answer.

321
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:12,250
Korean Federation of Community Credit Cooperatives.

322
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:13,250
Wrong!

323
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:16,650
What's with him?

324
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:20,600
What did Woo-shik say?

325
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:21,800
He said the KFCCC.

326
00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:28,050
He's so mean. So mean.

327
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,550
What's the KFCCC?

328
00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:51,250
When you've gone on a shoot in regional areas, on the way back,

329
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:55,100
Rest area?

330
00:18:56,150 --> 00:18:58,800
When you're nearly back to Seoul,

331
00:18:59,450 --> 00:19:00,300
Toll gate?

332
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:03,750
Do toll gates have music?

333
00:19:06,850 --> 00:19:08,200
Answer. KTX?

334
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,150
Correct!

335
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:11,750
He got it.

336
00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:13,950
Seo-joon, step back.

337
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,000
KFCCC was hilarious, wasn't it?

338
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,600
Woo-shik knew the answer but said KFCCC.

339
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:22,150
No, I didn't know it then.

340
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:23,800
Why did you say KFCCC?

341
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:27,700
It's 2 vs 1 now. 2 vs 1.

342
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:35,550
I don't have a clue.

343
00:19:39,050 --> 00:19:40,150
I know the answer.

344
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:41,900
MBC's .

345
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:43,350
Correct!

346
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:49,850
Is it just you two now?

347
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:52,500
Stand up and step back.

348
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:54,800
Tae-hyung. Wake up.

349
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:58,500
- Yu-mi vs Tae-hyung.
- I had no idea.

350
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,950
- What is this?
- You can do it.

351
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:03,050
Yu-mi vs Tae-hyung. Tae-hyung vs Yu-mi.

352
00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:49,750
Answer.

353
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:50,700
Kanye West?

354
00:20:51,050 --> 00:20:52,000
Wrong!

355
00:20:53,150 --> 00:20:54,850
You're not guessing the song!

356
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,950
What program is it? What program?

357
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:00,300
Was it really Kanye West though?

358
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:02,600
It is.

359
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:12,250
Shall I give you a hint? Do you want a hint?

360
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:15,250
No, don't give a hint and just go with something different.

361
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:16,900
- A different one.
- Different?

362
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:18,400
I thought Tae-hyung had it earlier.

363
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:20,350
It was .

364
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:25,600
It did feel like it would be one of those.

365
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:29,400
So that's why I thought Kanye West.

366
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,900
He was building up so much for no reason.

367
00:21:35,650 --> 00:21:38,350
As soon as you get it right you can leave.

368
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:39,600
You can run out.

369
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,450
I don't think we can go.

370
00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:46,100
You have to know this.

371
00:21:46,450 --> 00:21:47,350
Answer!

372
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:49,450
Youn's Kitchen!

373
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:51,700
Youn's Kitchen? Wrong!

374
00:21:54,850 --> 00:21:56,200
- Youn's Kitchen?
- Keep playing it please.

375
00:21:59,450 --> 00:22:01,100
Tae-hyung has it for 5 seconds.

376
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:02,600
It feels like this.

377
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:07,650
Anyone can answer now.

378
00:22:09,050 --> 00:22:10,050
This is the opening.

379
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,550
They haven't seen it.

380
00:22:12,550 --> 00:22:13,550
You have to know this.

381
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:14,750
What is it?

382
00:22:28,050 --> 00:22:29,200
We'll play it again.

383
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:32,500
Answer!

384
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:33,700
.

385
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:35,600
Correct!

386
00:22:36,050 --> 00:22:36,950
It was ?

387
00:22:38,650 --> 00:22:43,200
When 3/5 of the cast haven't seen the show XD

388
00:22:38,650 --> 00:22:41,200
It was ? ?

389
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,200
He didn't know either!

390
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:46,500
Let's go, let's go.

391
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:47,600
You have to know that one.

392
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:49,800
Do we go?

393
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:52,050
How do you not know your own show's title song?

394
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:54,900
- We thought that was a gift.
- I've never heard it before.

395
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,250
What car is it?

396
00:22:57,700 --> 00:22:58,600
Oh, these two?

397
00:22:59,850 --> 00:23:02,450
- The Genesis is nice.
- Isn't the Genesis better?

398
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,400
Whatever you prefer. Which one do you want?

399
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:07,050
The sedan's better. Don't you think?

400
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:17,100
The place entered in the navigation is the second location.

401
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:18,400
Seo-joon, is there anything entered in the navigation?

402
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:20,950
Misa Gyeongjeong Park?

403
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,400
Seatbelt.

404
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:27,750
Seo-jin, did you put on your seatbelt?

405
00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:28,800
Yep, I did.

406
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:31,450
- Did you put on your seatbelt?
- We're going.

407
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:38,450
Listen to the music and guess the program.

408
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,900
You can just go ahead and guess it.

409
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:56,600
You need to say the answer.

410
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,900
No, stop singing along. Say the answer.

411
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:08,900
You've been on this show. Recently.

412
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:14,200
Answer.

413
00:24:14,550 --> 00:24:15,450
.

414
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:17,200
Correct.

415
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,400
Let's go.

416
00:24:18,550 --> 00:24:21,800
Let's go, he says. This punk.

417
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:27,150
First floor.

418
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,150
Do I come out well?

419
00:24:36,150 --> 00:24:37,000
Me first?

420
00:24:38,050 --> 00:24:40,050
- However you want.
- I'll drive first then.

421
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,150
Are we really just going like this?

422
00:24:56,550 --> 00:25:00,100
This is like  style from back in the day.

423
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:01,600
Seo-joon, have you done anything like this before?

424
00:25:03,550 --> 00:25:06,950
I was a guest on  once.

425
00:25:06,950 --> 00:25:08,700
I did a shoot once way back.

426
00:25:12,050 --> 00:25:14,200
Who's in charge of us? Dae-ju?

427
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:19,200
Kim Dae-ju is a writer. He often appears on YT lives on Channel Full Moon alongside Na PD.

428
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:16,950
Can you hear me?

429
00:25:19,650 --> 00:25:20,800
Yes, I can hear you.

430
00:25:21,950 --> 00:25:24,150
Has the other team left yet?

431
00:25:28,450 --> 00:25:31,150
I can confirm that they have.

432
00:25:33,050 --> 00:25:34,500
Thanks.

433
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:49,800
Doesn't this sort of,

434
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:55,000
Feel like when we went to the market in ?

435
00:25:56,150 --> 00:25:57,250
Don't you want to go again?

436
00:25:57,850 --> 00:25:59,150
Yeah.

437
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:02,250
Lately I keep thinking of those times.

438
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:04,250
That's because it was tiring.

439
00:26:04,950 --> 00:26:07,450
- It was tiring,
- But it was fun.

440
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,200
Stays long in the memory.

441
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:22,500
After this song, give Seo-joon a call.

442
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,500
See how far he's got left to go.

443
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:29,350
Tae-hyung's calling. I'll pick up.

444
00:26:30,350 --> 00:26:31,250
Hello?

445
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:33,800
How far do you have left?

446
00:26:34,150 --> 00:26:35,700
- Us?
- Don't tell them.

447
00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:37,350
Where are you guys?

448
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,850
We're arriving now.

449
00:26:39,850 --> 00:26:41,800
- Where?
- What a joke.

450
00:26:42,550 --> 00:26:45,200
We're about to arrive. Where are you guys?

451
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,550
Where?

452
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,700
We're nearly at Goseong.

453
00:26:50,550 --> 00:26:52,650
Then why, I don't know why,

454
00:26:52,650 --> 00:26:55,150
But they told us to go via Incheon Airport?

455
00:26:55,450 --> 00:26:56,400
What a lie.

456
00:26:57,850 --> 00:26:59,500
Alright, have a good trip.

457
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:05,100
They're later than they thought they'd be so they're just fishing.

458
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,150
We're nearly there.

459
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:34,400
How far do you think the kids are?

460
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,600
They're still pretty far away, I bet.

461
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,250
They're still far.

462
00:27:38,250 --> 00:27:40,250
They could have gotten the question immediately and come down.

463
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:43,500
Hello.

464
00:27:46,350 --> 00:27:47,300
Here,

465
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:53,150
Like keepy-uppys or hacky sack but with a shuttlecock-like thing with a weight in it called a 'jegi'.

466
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:49,200
It's jegi.

467
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,250
- Jegi?
- Jegi?

468
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:54,850
You need to kick it 7 times between the three of you.

469
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:58,050
Every person needs to kick it at least once.

470
00:27:58,050 --> 00:28:00,250
- We only need 7 between the three of us?
- You do it continuously.

471
00:28:00,250 --> 00:28:03,250
Then after we kick it, 3 times, 2 times and 3 times, that's it?

472
00:28:03,250 --> 00:28:04,050
Yep.

473
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:05,750
Oh, nice, nice.

474
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:07,300
You can practise as much as you want.

475
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:09,450
You can make a challenge by saying "challenge".

476
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:12,500
But if you fail, you have to wait 3 minutes before trying again.

477
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:17,100
Seriously, now you want us to do jegichagi.

478
00:28:15,250 --> 00:28:20,000
Jegichagi: lit. "kicking jegi".

479
00:28:18,450 --> 00:28:19,800
Seo-joon's good at this.

480
00:28:25,050 --> 00:28:26,400
He's good.

481
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:32,100
He's good too?

482
00:28:33,550 --> 00:28:35,150
Right? You practise.

483
00:28:36,650 --> 00:28:37,550
I can't.

484
00:28:39,550 --> 00:28:41,500
The way I see it, Yu-mi just needs to kick it once at the end.

485
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:45,100
- Kick it hard.
- We need to be closer.

486
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,900
- Hold it here and drop it and kick.
- Just kick it once.

487
00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:55,900
She can't hit it at all.

488
00:28:57,450 --> 00:28:58,250
They're here.

489
00:29:00,050 --> 00:29:01,550
Is it jegichagi or something like that?

490
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:04,950
- I'm really bad at jegichagi.
- Me too.

491
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:10,350
- Shall we just go?
- Are you going to challenge?

492
00:29:10,350 --> 00:29:11,350
Shall we try?

493
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:16,200
Guys, please wait for a second. Are you challenging?

494
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:16,900
Challenge.

495
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:18,550
How many is it?

496
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:20,200
Watch from the side please.

497
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:21,450
Challenge.

498
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:28,250
Yu-mi, Yu-mi.

499
00:29:31,450 --> 00:29:32,300
Kick it!

500
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:33,500
Failure.

501
00:29:35,950 --> 00:29:37,400
That's allowed right? Heading it.

502
00:29:38,350 --> 00:29:41,650
- What do we do?
- The rules are the same for you.

503
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:44,200
There are only two men in this team,

504
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,100
- But we're both bad at this.
- We're really bad at this.

505
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:48,600
Try it, try it. Practise.

506
00:29:48,950 --> 00:29:49,950
Can we practise?

507
00:29:50,250 --> 00:29:52,750
Our 4th generation PD, her name is Ye-seul PD.

508
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,400
- Kim Ye-seul PD.
- She looks like she'd be good.

509
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:57,000
No, she's appropriate.

510
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,750
We chose a very appropriate PD.

511
00:29:58,750 --> 00:29:59,880
She looks good.

512
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:03,450
Kim Ye-seul PD (AKA 4th Generation PD)

513
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:03,450
Earth Arcade 1 & 2
Filming and editing countless
games gave her better skills
(we presumed)

514
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:03,550
Can you kick it?

515
00:30:05,850 --> 00:30:07,200
Time is going.

516
00:30:08,350 --> 00:30:10,400
- Wait, hang on.
- We're good. We're good.

517
00:30:12,550 --> 00:30:14,600
Yu-mi is the same. Yumi is.

518
00:30:15,150 --> 00:30:17,100
- Let's practise.
- What do we do?

519
00:30:17,250 --> 00:30:18,700
7? Combined 7?

520
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:19,800
A combined total of 7.

521
00:30:21,450 --> 00:30:22,800
This isn't going to work.

522
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:36,600
We need to do 6, and then give it to her.

523
00:30:38,450 --> 00:30:40,250
- Ok, challenge.
- It's a challenge.

524
00:30:44,650 --> 00:30:45,500
Oh no.

525
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:47,450
Failure. 3 minutes.

526
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:49,700
It's this hourglass.

527
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:51,200
Practise, quickly let's practise.

528
00:30:52,850 --> 00:30:54,250
We don't have much time left.

529
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:55,850
Challenge.

530
00:30:57,700 --> 00:30:59,500
About here, it feels like.

531
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:02,400
Failure.

532
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:05,000
Failure.

533
00:31:09,550 --> 00:31:10,600
Seo-jin.

534
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:13,100
All this just for some dakgalbi.

535
00:31:20,550 --> 00:31:23,400
I'll kick it as many times as I can, then pass it to you, and then you to her.

536
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:36,100
Again. Again.

537
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:52,550
Our team is amazing.

538
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:55,150
No, we're amazing.

539
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:59,950
3 minutes have passed for this team as well. You can make a challenge.

540
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:01,750
Let's get a bit closer together.

541
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:05,450
I'll do as many as I can, and then pass it to you.

542
00:32:05,450 --> 00:32:06,500
Challenge.

543
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:17,650
Failure.

544
00:32:26,950 --> 00:32:27,950
Challenge.

545
00:32:32,050 --> 00:32:33,000
Let's go.

546
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:34,800
Failure.

547
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:36,800
She didn't touch it.

548
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:39,400
From now, we'll just take turns.

549
00:32:40,450 --> 00:32:43,650
No more 3 minutes? Just in turn.

550
00:32:45,050 --> 00:32:45,750
Challenge.

551
00:32:52,150 --> 00:32:53,750
She touched it, she touched it.

552
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:56,350
- She touched it, she touched it.
- Failure!

553
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:59,000
She missed, she missed, she missed.

554
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:01,000
She didn't touch it.

555
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:02,150
Nearly.

556
00:33:03,050 --> 00:33:04,150
Let's go straight away.

557
00:33:04,150 --> 00:33:04,950
Challenge.

558
00:33:08,550 --> 00:33:09,250
Failure.

559
00:33:10,350 --> 00:33:11,150
Challenge.

560
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:16,450
Us now.

561
00:33:37,050 --> 00:33:37,700
Kick it.

562
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,150
Success!

563
00:33:44,950 --> 00:33:46,300
You may leave.

564
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:47,800
- This team,
- Straight away?

565
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:51,350
You may challenge whenever you like but you cannot leave until you succeed.

566
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:53,550
We turned the tables.

567
00:33:54,650 --> 00:33:55,700
Good job.

568
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:59,450
-nim is an honourific, and roughly equates to Mr/Ms/Mrs.

569
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:57,600
Wow, writer-nim.

570
00:33:57,700 --> 00:33:59,450
- Good job.
- Nice.

571
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:04,750
This is the address of the dakgalbi restaurant.

572
00:34:04,750 --> 00:34:06,000
Do we go straight to the restaurant?

573
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:06,850
Yep.

574
00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:09,150
Then do we win?

575
00:34:09,950 --> 00:34:11,650
- You never know.
- Oh there's something else.

576
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:19,900
Alright. Challenge.

577
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:26,300
Oh, my hamstring.

578
00:34:31,550 --> 00:34:33,200
I think he's all out of energy.

579
00:34:33,850 --> 00:34:35,200
No, it's sticking.

580
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:43,450
Yu-mi, kick it.

581
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:53,450
Just sit around for a bit and go.

582
00:34:54,850 --> 00:34:56,300
Who needs to eat chicken.

583
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,250
I'll go first.

584
00:34:58,800 --> 00:34:59,950
You first?

585
00:35:00,650 --> 00:35:02,800
This was fun!

586
00:35:04,250 --> 00:35:05,650
This was fun.

587
00:35:05,950 --> 00:35:07,450
Good luck.

588
00:35:17,350 --> 00:35:19,500
- Yu-mi, come closer.
- Sorry, sorry.

589
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:21,600
Closer.

590
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:30,350
- Got it.
- Success

591
00:35:30,350 --> 00:35:31,300
Let's go.

592
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:35,400
This is the address.

593
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:38,300
- Here you go.
- So tired.

594
00:35:39,450 --> 00:35:42,950
This is amazing. My butt hurts so much.

595
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:48,500
My butt.

596
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:51,550
I'm so out of breath.

597
00:35:55,050 --> 00:35:56,250
So sweaty.

598
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,050
Do we go now and just grill it for them?

599
00:36:06,050 --> 00:36:08,050
- Surely not.
- In that case,

600
00:36:08,350 --> 00:36:09,500
Let's just eat somewhere else.

601
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:11,050
Let's just stop by a rest stop or something and eat.

602
00:36:15,850 --> 00:36:18,500
Deep in the night.

603
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:20,850
Shall we listen to ?

604
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:47,750
Quickly. Park quickly.

605
00:36:48,550 --> 00:36:50,000
Quickly, get out.

606
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:05,500
You have arrived at the final location of the dakgalbi.

607
00:37:05,950 --> 00:37:07,500
We're ready. What is it?

608
00:37:08,250 --> 00:37:10,900
Have you heard of "Green Frog Rock Paper Scissors"?

609
00:37:08,250 --> 00:37:10,900
See Earth Arcade S1E2

610
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:13,800
No. Do we have to lose?

611
00:37:14,750 --> 00:37:16,850
Wait, I know it. What was it?

612
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,810
[First, we play Rock Paper Scissors,]

613
00:37:20,810 --> 00:37:23,910
[If you win, say "I lost"]

614
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:30,910
[If you lose, say "I won"]

615
00:37:32,310 --> 00:37:36,310
[If you tie, say "Ribbit" and play again]

616
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:41,500
[Make a round trip to succeed]

617
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:47,250
You have to succeed in order to enter.

618
00:37:47,250 --> 00:37:49,600
PD-nim. You can't fail.

619
00:37:51,650 --> 00:37:53,100
Do you know it?

620
00:37:53,250 --> 00:37:54,950
The game? I've played it a lot.

621
00:37:54,950 --> 00:37:55,950
Oh really?

622
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,350
Come on, let's cheer ourselves.

623
00:38:01,850 --> 00:38:02,900
Can we practise once?

624
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:03,850
Ok, practise.

625
00:38:04,150 --> 00:38:05,050
I'll practise.

626
00:38:05,650 --> 00:38:06,850
Alright, are you ready?

627
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:08,950
Alright, l-l-let's do it.

628
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:10,350
Rock Paper Scissors.

629
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:11,050
I won.

630
00:38:11,050 --> 00:38:11,700
That's it.

631
00:38:14,150 --> 00:38:15,000
Rock Paper Scissors.

632
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,400
- I won.
- That's wrong.

633
00:38:17,950 --> 00:38:18,750
Seriously.

634
00:38:21,150 --> 00:38:22,750
But you can do it like this.

635
00:38:23,550 --> 00:38:24,800
Just look at the other person.

636
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:26,950
Rock Paper Scissors.

637
00:38:26,950 --> 00:38:27,400
Ribbit.

638
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:28,000
Rock Paper Scissors.

639
00:38:28,250 --> 00:38:29,500
- I won.
- That's it.

640
00:38:30,450 --> 00:38:31,700
It's too easy.

641
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:34,700
If you're ready, please say "challenge".

642
00:38:35,150 --> 00:38:35,800
Challenge.

643
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:37,900

644
00:38:38,250 --> 00:38:39,000
I won.

645
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:40,050
Rock Paper Scissors.

646
00:38:40,450 --> 00:38:41,250
- I lost.
- Wrong!

647
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:43,800
- I lost.
- Wrong!

648
00:38:44,450 --> 00:38:45,950
You can challenge again after 3 minutes.

649
00:38:47,750 --> 00:38:49,050
It's hard to get it right straight away.

650
00:38:49,050 --> 00:38:49,800
Rock Paper Scissors.

651
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:50,600
I lost.

652
00:38:51,250 --> 00:38:52,000
Again, again.

653
00:38:54,450 --> 00:38:55,350
Rock Paper Scissors.

654
00:38:55,350 --> 00:38:56,850
I won. Again.

655
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:00,850
Round trip.

656
00:39:01,250 --> 00:39:02,250
Rock Paper Scissors.

657
00:39:02,250 --> 00:39:02,700
Ribbit.

658
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:03,580
Rock Paper Scissors.

659
00:39:03,580 --> 00:39:04,070
Ribbit.

660
00:39:04,070 --> 00:39:04,830
Rock Paper Scissors.

661
00:39:04,830 --> 00:39:05,320
Ribbit.

662
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:06,070
Rock Paper Scissors.

663
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:07,930
There's another game?

664
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:10,330
Rock Paper Scissors.

665
00:39:10,330 --> 00:39:10,910
I lost.

666
00:39:11,170 --> 00:39:12,110
Rock Paper Scissors.

667
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:13,350
- I lost.
- Wrong!

668
00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:17,920
[Too slow].

669
00:39:18,330 --> 00:39:20,110
- I said I lost.
- It's okay.

670
00:39:21,350 --> 00:39:23,660
Those people won't be here for another 20 minutes or so.

671
00:39:24,110 --> 00:39:25,570
They're right behind you.

672
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:27,970
Oh, they came in the sedan.

673
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:30,950
What is it?

674
00:39:30,950 --> 00:39:32,950
From now you can just go in turns.

675
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:36,420
- Do we go straight away?
- Yep, you can challenge straight away.

676
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:38,150
If you draw, say "ribbit".

677
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:41,570
If you win, say "I lost", and if you lose, say "I won".

678
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:44,200
I don't think we're going to pass anyway so shall we just try it?

679
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:45,040
Let's try it.

680
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:48,280
You're so at ease.

681
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:50,280
We're not going to be able to eat anyway.

682
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:52,200
Challenge.

683
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:53,840

684
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:54,400

00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:01,800
I won.

691
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:02,640
Wrong!

692
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:03,640
Rock Paper Scissors.

693
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:04,840
I won.

694
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:05,640
Wrong!

695
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:07,880
- You did win.
- Bye.

696
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:09,600
You did win. You did win.

697
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:13,160
Young people, come on.

698
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:15,000
We don't have to wait 3 minutes anymore?

699
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,160
Straight away.

700
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:18,280
Rock Paper Scissors.

701
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:18,840
Ribbit.

702
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:19,560
Rock Paper Scissors.

703
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:20,200
Ribbit.

704

705
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:21,840

709
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:25,200
I won.

710
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:26,040
Rock Paper Scissors.

711
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:26,840
Ribbit.

712
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:27,480
Rock Paper Scissors.

713
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:28,160
Ribbit.

714
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:28,720
Rock Paper Scissors.

715
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:29,640
I lon.

716
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:34,040
You lon? You lon? You lon?

717
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:36,680
Out! Out! You're out.

718
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:39,840
If you do well you can eat.

719
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:42,360
Challenge. Rock Paper Scissors.

720
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:43,360
I lost

721
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:44,320

723
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:46,520
Rock Paper Scissors.

724
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:47,520
Eu-ibbit.

725
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:48,280
Rock Paper Scissors.

726
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:49,240
Uh-ribbit.

727
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:49,920
Rock Paper Scissors.

728
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:51,880
- I lost.
- Wrong.

729
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:53,400
- Go.
- She said it.

730
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:54,840
Rock Paper Scissors.

731
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:56,520
- I lost.
- Wrong.

732
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,160
- Go.
- She said it.

733
00:40:58,480 --> 00:40:59,800
- She said she lost.
- Wrong wrong wrong.

734
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:01,520
I think I've seen that back in the day.

735
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:05,120
I think a lot of comedians used to do that.

736
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:07,120
I'm hungry.

737
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:09,400
- Now, the young people.
- It's okay, I'll end it for you.

738
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:11,440
Rock Paper Scissors.

739
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:12,280
I won.

740
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:12,960
Rock Paper Scissors.

741
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:13,480
I lost.

742
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:14,280
Rock Paper Scissors.

743
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:15,320
I wo-ah.

744
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:18,040
Rock Paper Scissors.

745
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:20,040
I wo-ah.

746
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:22,760
Quickly.

747
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:26,760
Quickly. Yu-mi.

748
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:30,320
I'm here.

749
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:32,160
Rock Paper Scissors.

750
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:32,920
I won!

751
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:34,760
- Rock-who is it?
- What?

752
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:36,440
Rock Paper Scissors.

753
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:38,240
I lost. Dammit I lost.

754
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:43,080
Rock Paper Scissors.

755
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:43,720
I lost.

756
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:44,480
Rock Paper Scissors.

757
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:45,440
I lost.

758
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:46,320
Rock Paper Scissors.

759
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:46,920
I lost.

760
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:48,000
Wrong!

761
00:41:58,140 --> 00:41:59,260
Why is it so fast?

762
00:42:00,340 --> 00:42:01,500
Open your eyes wide.

763
00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:05,060
Rock Paper Scissors.

764
00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:05,860
I won.

765
00:42:05,860 --> 00:42:06,860
Rock Paper Scissors.

766
00:42:07,140 --> 00:42:07,660
I won.

767
00:42:07,660 --> 00:42:08,460
Rock Paper Scissors.

768
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:09,220
I lost.

769
00:42:09,220 --> 00:42:10,820
You lost, you lost, you lost.

770
00:42:13,780 --> 00:42:14,580
Rock Paper Scissors.

771
00:42:14,820 --> 00:42:15,340
I won.

772
00:42:15,340 --> 00:42:16,180
Rock Paper Scissors.

773
00:42:16,180 --> 00:42:16,780
I lost.

774
00:42:16,780 --> 00:42:17,580
Rock Paper Scissors.

775
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:18,220
I won.

776
00:42:20,220 --> 00:42:21,060
Rock Paper Scissors.

777
00:42:21,460 --> 00:42:21,900
Ribbit.

778
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:23,900
Rock Paper Scissors.

779
00:42:24,220 --> 00:42:24,660
Ribbit.

780
00:42:24,660 --> 00:42:25,260
Rock Paper Scissors.

781
00:42:25,260 --> 00:42:25,980
Ribbit.

782
00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:26,700
Rock Paper Scissors.

783
00:42:26,980 --> 00:42:27,660
I won.

784
00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:28,620
Rock Paper Scissors.

785
00:42:29,020 --> 00:42:29,500
Ribbit.

786
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:30,100
Rock Paper Scissors.

787
00:42:30,220 --> 00:42:30,820
Ribbit.

788
00:42:30,820 --> 00:42:31,860

00:42:31,860 --> 00:42:32,300
Ribbit.

790
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:32,900
Rock Paper Scissors.

791
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:33,540
Ribbit.

792
00:42:33,540 --> 00:42:34,180
Rock Paper Scissors.

793
00:42:34,460 --> 00:42:34,980
I lost!

794
00:42:36,980 --> 00:42:37,940
Rock Paper Scissors.

795
00:42:38,060 --> 00:42:38,660
I lost!

796
00:42:39,020 --> 00:42:39,900
Success!

797
00:42:42,820 --> 00:42:45,100
Alright. Rock Paper Scissors. No?

798
00:42:47,420 --> 00:42:49,060
Well played, employees.

799
00:42:50,060 --> 00:42:52,020
Interns, you may go ahead and eat.

800
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:56,420
Open the path!

801
00:42:56,420 --> 00:42:58,300
Please press 'Push'.

802
00:43:00,700 --> 00:43:02,140
Hello.

803
00:43:44,260 --> 00:43:45,420
I'm so hungry.

804
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:51,860
Why are you sitting there?

805
00:43:51,860 --> 00:43:54,220
Wait, sorry. Why are you there?

806
00:43:54,740 --> 00:43:56,540
- Aren't we here?
- Aren't we sitting together?

807
00:43:56,540 --> 00:43:57,340
What?

808
00:43:57,620 --> 00:43:59,060
Go sit at the empty table.

809
00:43:59,060 --> 00:44:00,460
There are spare seats though.

810
00:44:00,660 --> 00:44:01,420
Since they're spare?

811
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:05,930
- I'm so hungry.
- There's so much.

812
00:44:06,300 --> 00:44:07,930
Interns, enjoy your food.

813
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:09,260
Bon Appetit.

814
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:10,860
I'll grill it nicely for you.

815
00:44:16,530 --> 00:44:18,130
- Eat now.
- Eat, eat, eat.

816
00:44:35,300 --> 00:44:35,960
I,

817
00:44:36,660 --> 00:44:39,130
I won't be kissing anyone today, so I'm going to eat garlic.

818
00:44:40,130 --> 00:44:41,300
Do whatever you want.

819
00:44:46,730 --> 00:44:49,200
So, we're just not allowed to eat the dakgalbi, right?

820
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:51,230
Is there something else?

821
00:44:52,100 --> 00:44:52,760
The sides.

822
00:44:53,630 --> 00:44:54,830
We can eat the sides, can't we?

823
00:44:55,630 --> 00:44:58,100
The sides. Well you can try discussing that with the interns.

824
00:44:58,730 --> 00:44:59,830
What's that? Seo-joon?

825
00:45:00,330 --> 00:45:03,600
This? I think it's pollack.

826
00:45:12,660 --> 00:45:13,530
The sides.

827
00:45:14,530 --> 00:45:15,230
Are they good?

828
00:45:15,230 --> 00:45:16,500
We can eat the sides.

829
00:45:22,930 --> 00:45:24,460
Seo-jin, you're..

830
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:27,000
You're sitting there a bit too much like a winner.

831
00:45:27,930 --> 00:45:29,800
I mean, why did we do the game?

832
00:45:31,730 --> 00:45:33,660
Aren't you eating too much?

833
00:45:34,100 --> 00:45:35,300
I'm not eating any.

834
00:45:35,300 --> 00:45:37,200
I'm not eating any dakgalbi.

835
00:45:38,460 --> 00:45:41,360
- So what?
- You're not eating it because it's not cooked yet.

836
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:44,100
Did the interns okay this?

837
00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:45,200
Of course.

838
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,460
Then I'll just have some sides.

839
00:46:03,630 --> 00:46:05,400
Is there anyone who would like some beer?

840
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:06,030
I already ordered it.

841
00:46:08,060 --> 00:46:09,700
Hang on, this is a team building retreat,

842
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:13,460
- I'm not eating any dakglabi!
- You should all talk together and then decide.

843
00:46:13,460 --> 00:46:14,900
Why is the beer so big?

844
00:46:15,730 --> 00:46:16,630
That looks good.

845
00:46:19,430 --> 00:46:20,500
What beer is it?

846
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:24,430
I haven't had this in so long.

847
00:46:26,830 --> 00:46:28,130
You're not supposed to be having it.

848
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:36,500
Woo-shik. Put one in Seo-joon's mouth.

849
00:46:38,930 --> 00:46:39,760
Want a wrap?

850
00:46:41,100 --> 00:46:41,760
However you like.

851
00:46:54,030 --> 00:46:54,700
Huh?

852
00:46:55,830 --> 00:46:57,460
It just went in so naturally.

853
00:47:00,530 --> 00:47:01,430
Did you eat that?

854
00:47:04,430 --> 00:47:05,200
Huh?

855
00:47:10,300 --> 00:47:11,430
A lettuce wrap?

856
00:47:12,530 --> 00:47:14,200
I'm only eating it because he put it in my mouth.

857
00:47:16,060 --> 00:47:18,800
Wait, just then, Seo-jin was like,

858
00:47:19,100 --> 00:47:22,230
Woo-shik. Put one in Seo-joon's mouth, since he's grilling it.

859
00:47:22,830 --> 00:47:24,930
Do I have to put one in your mouth then?

860
00:47:25,330 --> 00:47:26,060
Of course.

861
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:41,030
That's good.

862
00:47:43,030 --> 00:47:44,200
I'm full now.

863
00:47:45,700 --> 00:47:47,100
He's full.

864
00:47:49,830 --> 00:47:51,560
- This is good though.
- Right?

865
00:47:52,460 --> 00:47:53,360
It's so good.

866
00:47:54,700 --> 00:47:56,400
Do you want to go together? Or what?

867
00:47:56,900 --> 00:48:00,330
Room deciding game, dinner game, late night game.

868
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:02,360
But we don't need a room deciding game,

869
00:48:02,360 --> 00:48:05,330
Because Tae-hyung will always come and sleep next to someone.

870
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:10,930
Yes, but the rooms, there might not only be good rooms.

871
00:48:14,360 --> 00:48:17,100
If we're going to distinguish between everything, what's the point of a team building retreat?

872
00:48:19,630 --> 00:48:22,530
If we're all picking and choosing, why are we doing a team building retreat?

873
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:26,130
How is this a team building retreat?

874
00:48:26,660 --> 00:48:28,060
Thank you for the food!

875
00:48:30,530 --> 00:48:33,000
[15:30: Move to accomodation]

876
00:48:33,460 --> 00:48:34,360
Who wants to drive?

877
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:35,700
- I'll drive.
- I'll do it.

878
00:48:35,700 --> 00:48:36,660
Let's rock paper scissors for it.

879
00:48:37,330 --> 00:48:39,530
Let's just make it pretty and have the winner drive.

880
00:48:39,530 --> 00:48:40,930
Okay, the winner. Just one game?

881
00:48:41,330 --> 00:48:42,430
Rock Paper Scissors.

882
00:48:42,700 --> 00:48:43,500
Ribbit. No?

883
00:48:44,560 --> 00:48:45,630
Rock Paper Scissors.

884
00:48:51,830 --> 00:48:53,500
It's going to be evening when we arrive.

885
00:48:54,430 --> 00:48:56,500
Tae-hyung. Let us know.

886
00:48:57,760 --> 00:48:58,630
I'll let you know if I get tired.

887
00:48:58,630 --> 00:48:59,630
Let's change after an hour.

888
00:49:20,330 --> 00:49:23,300
I'm going to up the volume to wake me up.

889
00:49:23,300 --> 00:49:23,800
Alright.

890
00:49:26,660 --> 00:49:28,400
You really love this song.

891
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,500
It's been a while, Goseong.

892
00:50:02,730 --> 00:50:04,460
We come to Goseong surprisingly often.

893
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:05,920
Woo-sik and Yu-mi shot another Na PD show,
together in Goseong (Seo-joon was a guest).

894
00:50:06,900 --> 00:50:08,900
That's the famous,

895
00:50:12,630 --> 00:50:16,800
There's a famous story about that mountain. A really famous story.

896
00:50:17,830 --> 00:50:19,560
Look there, that's Ulsan Rock.

897
00:50:19,560 --> 00:50:20,560
Where?

898
00:50:21,060 --> 00:50:23,060
There, there. Right there.

899
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:31,860
He's asking because they're in the far North-East of South Korea, but Ulsan is a city in the very South-East.

900
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:26,760
Why is it called Ulsan Rock?

901
00:50:26,900 --> 00:50:31,860
Because one of the rocks was coming from Ulsan, but it couldn't make it all the way.

902
00:50:32,430 --> 00:50:36,200
[One day the god of mountains was making Mt Geumgang and called all the big rocks in Korea there to make it.]

903
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:39,880
[The rock from Ulsan came all this way but couldn't arrive on time, and then ended up staying here in Mt Seorak]

904
00:50:39,880 --> 00:50:44,000
Yu-mi's told the story using a word that means it/he/she instead of saying 'the rock'.

905
00:50:39,880 --> 00:50:41,160
Is this during the Korean war?

906
00:50:42,260 --> 00:50:44,000
No, it's a story.

907
00:50:44,900 --> 00:50:49,230
I think she told it wrong, saying it came from the North instead of it was going to the North.

908
00:50:44,900 --> 00:50:46,760
When did it come down then? From the North

909
00:50:47,130 --> 00:50:49,230
Oh, it's just like a fairy tale?

910
00:50:51,030 --> 00:50:51,800
I was wondering,

911
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:57,330
She said it came from the north.

912
00:51:03,260 --> 00:51:06,100
- We filmed in Goseong.
- Was that ?

913
00:51:06,100 --> 00:51:08,300
There's a really nice naengmyeon place here.

914
00:51:08,300 --> 00:51:09,930
The Donkass here are really good.

915
00:51:10,230 --> 00:51:12,360
And if you go down there, there's a place that does a great jjamppong.

916
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:17,230
Driving my crazy.

917
00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:21,530
Then let's go there for dinner and have some Kaoliang liquor.

918
00:51:22,430 --> 00:51:23,360
After coming all this way?

919
00:51:24,700 --> 00:51:27,660
It's not like we're overseas, all the food is more or less the same.

920
00:51:28,130 --> 00:51:30,800
But they're really good. And Tae-hyung loves Jjajjangmyeon.

921
00:51:31,630 --> 00:51:32,800
Oh, here it is.

922
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:44,100
Is it here?

923
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:52,300
This is nice.

924
00:51:56,570 --> 00:51:59,060
[17:30: Room Deciding Game]

925
00:52:00,730 --> 00:52:02,360
So, we've arrived at the EiC training institute.

926
00:52:02,360 --> 00:52:04,630
This is Goseong, in Gangwon-do.

927
00:52:09,260 --> 00:52:10,960
You're going to sleep here tonight,

928
00:52:11,430 --> 00:52:14,000
But the important thing is where you sleep.

929
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:17,330
This building has 4 floors.

930
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:22,630
But the nicest suite room of this training institute is the 4th floor.

931
00:52:24,130 --> 00:52:25,860
To tell you about the 4th floor,

932
00:52:27,430 --> 00:52:29,060
On the 4th floor, the main bedroom.

933
00:52:29,560 --> 00:52:33,730
It's the best room with a bathroom. With a bed.

934
00:52:34,030 --> 00:52:35,830
The room that Yu-mi's always in?

935
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:42,160
See? This is why we needed a team building retreat.

936
00:52:42,430 --> 00:52:45,060
Everything's been festering within and is overflowing bit by bit.

937
00:52:46,330 --> 00:52:47,030
It's nice.

938
00:52:48,430 --> 00:52:50,300
The second best room is the entry room.

939
00:52:48,430 --> 00:52:50,300
As in, it's near the entrance.

940
00:52:51,600 --> 00:52:53,800
Third, there's a loft.

941
00:52:54,560 --> 00:52:55,430
A loft?

942
00:52:55,430 --> 00:52:56,900
Oh that must be good vibes.

943
00:52:58,030 --> 00:53:02,820
Korean has another word that translates to 'romantic' when speaking of dreams/aspirations when you were young, like how ideas get romanticised, rather than romantic love.

944
00:52:58,030 --> 00:53:00,030
It's romantic, but there's nothing there.

945
00:53:01,060 --> 00:53:02,100
Are there not even windows?

946
00:53:02,820 --> 00:53:04,260
There aren't windows, are there?

947
00:53:02,820 --> 00:53:04,120
[There are, but they are over the living room]

948
00:53:04,930 --> 00:53:06,560
So it's just storage.

949
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:11,130
And then, not even your own room, the living room.

950
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,930
The nice thing about the living room is that you can still sleep comfortably.

951
00:53:18,560 --> 00:53:21,100
- However,
- People coming back and forth.

952
00:53:22,900 --> 00:53:25,560
And then, finally, if you look behind you,

953
00:53:28,060 --> 00:53:29,700
Do you see the veranda that's sticking out?

954
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:39,100
So we're going to become mosquito food.

955
00:53:41,300 --> 00:53:43,560
We'll give you a 1 person tent,

956
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,460
So finally, there's the terrace.

957
00:53:47,630 --> 00:53:49,030
It does have a sea view.

958
00:53:50,060 --> 00:53:50,700
Isn't that nice?

959
00:53:50,700 --> 00:53:54,130
Are you going to give us only a tent?

960
00:53:54,130 --> 00:53:55,660
Tent, mat, sleeping bag.

961
00:53:56,160 --> 00:53:57,400
As far as a place to sleep goes,

962
00:53:58,230 --> 00:53:59,300
I think it's romantic.

963
00:53:59,300 --> 00:54:00,330
For example, if Seo-jin decides,

964
00:54:00,330 --> 00:54:01,900
"I'll sleep there,"

965
00:54:02,100 --> 00:54:03,800
Then we don't need to do a game or anything.

966
00:54:05,160 --> 00:54:06,460
I don't think theres any chance he'd do that.

967
00:54:08,460 --> 00:54:09,800
I hate romance the most.

968
00:54:15,600 --> 00:54:17,330
Even in the depths of your heart,

969
00:54:17,930 --> 00:54:22,500
At one time. At one time, there must've been something warm?

970
00:54:23,830 --> 00:54:24,360
I don't remember.

971
00:54:26,430 --> 00:54:28,300
Even when you were like 24?

972
00:54:28,560 --> 00:54:31,100
Again, not talking about romantic love. More of a "Oh, I'd like to try that some time".

973
00:54:28,560 --> 00:54:30,460
- Romance?
- There was.

974
00:54:31,100 --> 00:54:32,860
Where you sleep has nothing to do with romance.

975
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:38,700
In the morning with the rising sun and the fresh wind,

976
00:54:38,800 --> 00:54:41,760
I don't even draw the curtains in the morning, what are you talking about?

977
00:54:42,360 --> 00:54:43,730
Why would I watch the rising sun?

978
00:54:46,100 --> 00:54:47,660
I see. Well in that case,

979
00:54:48,530 --> 00:54:49,430
It's war.

980
00:54:49,830 --> 00:54:51,230
If you're going to divide us like this,

981
00:54:51,230 --> 00:54:53,230
In what way is this a team building retreat?

982
00:54:54,600 --> 00:54:55,600
You call this team building?

983
00:54:56,460 --> 00:54:58,000
You call all this team building?

984
00:55:00,560 --> 00:55:03,030
You want us to rip each other to shreds, and you call it team building?

985
00:55:05,830 --> 00:55:09,930
Anyway, so before we decide rooms, this is a team building retreat after all,

986
00:55:10,060 --> 00:55:12,830
Let's take some time to learn about each others' preferences.

987
00:55:12,860 --> 00:55:17,200
The last thing you'd eat before you die. Your favourite food.

988
00:55:18,430 --> 00:55:21,300
Starting with Seo-jin, let's find out about the boss's preferences.

989
00:55:21,300 --> 00:55:22,660
Earth is going to be destroyed tomorrow.

990
00:55:23,060 --> 00:55:25,360
What? Then I'd have no appetite.

991
00:55:26,730 --> 00:55:28,530
Because the Earth is going to be destroyed tomorrow?

992
00:55:29,660 --> 00:55:31,200
I wouldn't have an appetite.

993
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:33,530
Ok, he wouldn't have an appetite.

994
00:55:34,460 --> 00:55:36,200
Tae-hyung, the Earth is being destroyed tomorrow.

995
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:37,800
What would be your last meal?

996
00:55:38,230 --> 00:55:40,730
I'm so worried this is going to end up being our name or something.

997
00:55:42,730 --> 00:55:45,530
Samgyeopsal = Pork belly. Especially Kbbq.

998
00:55:42,730 --> 00:55:43,600
Samgyeopsal?

999
00:55:44,060 --> 00:55:48,030
Pork belly. Tae-hyung, pork belly. Seo-joon?

1000
00:55:48,030 --> 00:55:49,100
It was pork belly for me too.

1001
00:55:50,530 --> 00:55:51,760
Then they can eat together.

1002
00:55:52,030 --> 00:55:54,100
Then I'll do crab.

1003
00:55:54,660 --> 00:55:55,430
Crab.

1004
00:55:55,930 --> 00:55:57,430
Crab? Crab for Tae-hyung?

1005
00:55:57,700 --> 00:55:58,400
You eat crab?

1006
00:56:00,230 --> 00:56:00,860
Yeah.

1007
00:56:02,360 --> 00:56:03,500
So you eat seafood too?

1008
00:56:04,530 --> 00:56:05,060
What?

1009
00:56:05,430 --> 00:56:08,100
This is how you get to know each other. You didn't even know that.

1010
00:56:08,100 --> 00:56:10,300
You should know your employees' preferences.

1011
00:56:10,300 --> 00:56:11,260
What about you?

1012
00:56:11,430 --> 00:56:12,800
Me? I..

1013
00:56:13,960 --> 00:56:15,530
I'll go for kimchi jjigae.

1014
00:56:17,100 --> 00:56:18,430
What a long name.

1015
00:56:19,730 --> 00:56:23,600
Then finally, Jung Yu-mi. The Earth is being destroyed tomorrow.

1016
00:56:23,600 --> 00:56:25,130
She's been thinking about this for a while.

1017
00:56:25,730 --> 00:56:26,600
Fried dumplings.

1018
00:56:27,100 --> 00:56:28,230
Fried dumplings?

1019
00:56:30,230 --> 00:56:32,560
Yu-mi, what about something like poo pad pong curry?

1020
00:56:34,200 --> 00:56:37,400
Alright, so, your favourite foods.

1021
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:40,160
The foods you'd eat before you die, will become your names for today.

1022
00:56:41,030 --> 00:56:43,960
The game to decide your room is the strawberry game.

1023
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:46,360
I'm screwed.

1024
00:56:46,360 --> 00:56:47,060
I'm in trouble.

1025
00:56:47,460 --> 00:56:51,060
Oh, like "I am ground," that one.

1026
00:56:57,060 --> 00:56:58,000
8 beats.

1027
00:56:58,000 --> 00:56:59,560
Is right and left in order too?

1028
00:56:59,560 --> 00:57:00,860
That doesn't matter.

1029
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:03,500
For your information,

1030
00:57:04,030 --> 00:57:08,800
Lee Seo-jin has played this game, about 10 years ago.

1031
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:12,130
I got eliminated straight away, what do you mean I played.

1032
00:57:12,560 --> 00:57:14,030
I got eliminated straight away.

1033
00:57:14,550 --> 00:57:19,510
Season 1

1034
00:57:19,630 --> 00:57:22,860
- I can't at all.
- You can do it.

1035
00:57:23,460 --> 00:57:28,400
In that case, let's go easily with 4 beats. You can do 4 beats.

1036
00:57:33,830 --> 00:57:35,460
- Who's starting?
- Yu-mi's starting.

1037
00:57:36,030 --> 00:57:36,800
I am dumplings.

1038
00:57:38,120 --> 00:57:39,150
I am kimchi jjigae.

1039
00:57:40,010 --> 00:57:40,900
I am pork belly.

1040
00:57:41,720 --> 00:57:42,640
I am crab.

1041
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:44,500
I am appetite (absense of).

1042
00:57:46,120 --> 00:57:49,320
I am ground, starting now.

1043
00:57:50,380 --> 00:57:51,210
Dumplings, 4.

1044
00:58:00,100 --> 00:58:01,010
Bye.

1045
00:58:01,120 --> 00:58:04,040
We won't see you out.

1046
00:58:04,350 --> 00:58:05,980
Wow. Thank you so much, Yu-mi.

1047
00:58:07,610 --> 00:58:09,320
What are you doing, Yu-mi?

1048
00:58:10,300 --> 00:58:11,240
I am dumplings.

1049
00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:13,410
Dumplings, 4.

1050
00:58:17,010 --> 00:58:20,350
Yu-mi! That was too funny, we can't even edit that out.

1051
00:58:21,720 --> 00:58:22,780
Let's just play amongst ourselves.

1052
00:58:26,100 --> 00:58:27,070
We're good now.

1053
00:58:28,520 --> 00:58:30,150
In this case, I'm good. I'm satisfied.

1054
00:58:30,920 --> 00:58:32,320
I'll enjoy the romance.

1055
00:58:35,240 --> 00:58:37,240
I think 4 beats is more than fine.

1056
00:58:37,840 --> 00:58:39,550
We'll start with Woo-shik then.

1057
00:58:40,740 --> 00:58:41,170
Straight away?

1058
00:58:42,940 --> 00:58:46,000
I am ground, starting now.

1059
00:58:46,940 --> 00:58:47,710
Appetite, 1.

1060
00:58:49,110 --> 00:58:49,540
Appetite.

1061
00:58:50,310 --> 00:58:51,110
Crab, 2.

1062
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:52,800
Crab, crab.

1063
00:58:53,620 --> 00:58:54,310
Appetite, 4.

1064
00:58:54,450 --> 00:58:56,110
Appetite, appetite, appetite, appetite.

1065
00:58:56,880 --> 00:58:57,620
Pork belly, 3.

1066
00:58:58,140 --> 00:58:59,400
Pork belly, pork belly, pork belly.

1067
00:59:00,200 --> 00:59:00,970
Appetite, 3.

1068
00:59:01,600 --> 00:59:03,050
Appetite, appetite, appetite.

1069
00:59:03,310 --> 00:59:03,880
I got it.

1070
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:05,800
Appetite, appetite, appetite.

1071
00:59:06,310 --> 00:59:06,880
I got it.

1072
00:59:07,540 --> 00:59:08,480
I got it. Why?

1073
00:59:09,110 --> 00:59:11,000
That's a warning.

1074
00:59:11,370 --> 00:59:13,740
- You were a little,
- It was offbeat.

1075
00:59:14,740 --> 00:59:18,570
If you're going to keep pushing the beat like that, that's a bit.

1076
00:59:18,940 --> 00:59:19,620
It was a layback.

1077
00:59:21,940 --> 00:59:24,770
Let's go again. Let's go a bit quicker, starting with Woo-shik.

1078
00:59:25,050 --> 00:59:27,280
I am ground, starting now.

1079
00:59:27,850 --> 00:59:28,540
Crab, 2.

1080
00:59:29,130 --> 00:59:29,800
Crab, crab.

1081
00:59:30,420 --> 00:59:31,000
Appetite, 4.

1082
00:59:31,110 --> 00:59:32,310
Appetite, appetite, appetite, appetite.

1083
00:59:32,970 --> 00:59:33,440
Pork belly, 3.

1084
00:59:35,020 --> 00:59:35,600
Pork be-

1085
00:59:40,550 --> 00:59:42,110
How did this,

1086
00:59:45,550 --> 00:59:47,350
But, but,

1087
00:59:48,060 --> 00:59:50,460
He attacked him. He only said "samgyeop".

1088
00:59:51,150 --> 00:59:53,860
I was thinking if I had to only say "samgyeop"

1089
00:59:56,800 --> 00:59:57,900
It's "samgyeopsal".

1090
00:59:59,300 --> 01:00:01,150
What's the difference? Seriously.

1091
01:00:03,050 --> 01:00:05,350
Well, it was funny so Park Seo-joon is out.

1092
01:00:06,800 --> 01:00:07,920
Woo-shik, come closer.

1093
01:00:10,270 --> 01:00:12,000
But the CEO is still alive.

1094
01:00:12,600 --> 01:00:13,870
And now I'm about to die.

1095
01:00:15,870 --> 01:00:17,700
You can't keep up with the young kids.

1096
01:00:18,100 --> 01:00:20,000
So how about it? Shall we go for the 8 beats?

1097
01:00:20,220 --> 01:00:21,100
If we do, I'm done for.

1098
01:00:22,950 --> 01:00:24,200
Well we need to end it,

1099
01:00:24,200 --> 01:00:26,350
Besides, even if we keep it to 4, I'm about to die.

1100
01:00:26,500 --> 01:00:27,550
We don't need to go to 8.

1101
01:00:27,800 --> 01:00:29,820
They're obviously both going to attack me.

1102
01:00:30,750 --> 01:00:31,520
It's obvious.

1103
01:00:31,950 --> 01:00:34,600
Then we'll give you the chance to attack first.

1104
01:00:34,600 --> 01:00:36,020
But the arrows are going to keep coming.

1105
01:00:37,720 --> 01:00:38,570
They're practising.

1106
01:00:39,750 --> 01:00:41,600
Even so, let's go with 8 beats.

1107
01:00:41,800 --> 01:00:46,050
1, 2, 3, 4, shoulder, shoulder, then this.

1108
01:00:49,920 --> 01:00:51,400
I can't do this, what is it?

1109
01:00:59,400 --> 01:01:02,420
I can't even do the action. I can't even.

1110
01:01:03,220 --> 01:01:05,050
You can do it if you go slowly.

1111
01:01:09,750 --> 01:01:10,320
That's 5.

1112
01:01:11,170 --> 01:01:11,970
5 is hard.

1113
01:01:20,270 --> 01:01:21,170
It just doesn't work.

1114
01:01:21,420 --> 01:01:23,820
That's why we're giving you the chance to attack first.

1115
01:01:23,820 --> 01:01:25,320
What's the point of attacking? It's going to come straight back and it'll be over.

1116
01:01:25,320 --> 01:01:26,550
But they might get it wrong.

1117
01:01:26,670 --> 01:01:29,650
The way I see it, Woo-shik could be knocked out with just one hit.

1118
01:01:31,070 --> 01:01:32,800
Woo-shik? What was he? Kimchi jjigae?

1119
01:01:33,020 --> 01:01:34,200
Alright, let's go straight away.

1120
01:01:39,150 --> 01:01:42,470
I am ground, starting now.

1121
01:01:46,720 --> 01:01:48,850
Kimchi jjigae, 8.

1122
01:01:49,450 --> 01:01:53,650
Kimchi jjigae, kimchi jjigae, kimchi jjigae, kimchi jjigae, kimchi jjigae, kimchi jjigae, kimchi jjigae, kimchi jjigae.

1123
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:57,770
Appetite, 3

1124
01:02:00,950 --> 01:02:02,370
Appetite, appetite, appetite.

1125
01:02:07,020 --> 01:02:08,570
Kimchi jjigae, 5.

1126
01:02:11,170 --> 01:02:12,420
Kimchi jjigae, kimchi jjigae,

1127
01:02:12,420 --> 01:02:13,820
Wrong! Wrong!

1128
01:02:15,220 --> 01:02:16,450
Kimchi jjigae, kimchi jjigae,

1129
01:02:16,450 --> 01:02:17,720
Wrong! Wrong!

1130
01:02:18,350 --> 01:02:19,270
Choi Woo-shik is out!

1131
01:02:23,410 --> 01:02:24,810
You survived!

1132
01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:31,180
But look at this two-shot.

1133
01:02:31,300 --> 01:02:34,550
In the end, it's the highest person in the company,

1134
01:02:35,240 --> 01:02:37,900
And the youngest.

1135
01:02:39,180 --> 01:02:40,840
Look at the MZ kid's movements.

1136
01:02:47,120 --> 01:02:51,300
Even so, we have to give the chance to attack first to the CEO.

1137
01:02:52,070 --> 01:02:54,520
What is this, I can't even remember the movements.

1138
01:02:54,810 --> 01:02:55,900
You can just watch us while you do it.

1139
01:02:57,520 --> 01:03:01,150
I am ground, starting now.

1140
01:03:05,050 --> 01:03:05,920
Crab, 5.

1141
01:03:07,500 --> 01:03:09,500
Crab, crab, crab, crab, crab.

1142
01:03:12,550 --> 01:03:13,400
Appetite, 7.

1143
01:03:14,370 --> 01:03:18,050
Appetite, appetite, appetite, appetite, appetite, appetite, appetite.

1144
01:03:19,170 --> 01:03:22,570
Appetite, appetite, appetite, appetite, appetite, appetite, appetite.

1145
01:03:22,950 --> 01:03:24,450
Pass, pass.

1146
01:03:25,870 --> 01:03:26,720
Crab, 6.

1147
01:03:27,850 --> 01:03:30,420
Crab, crab, crab, crab, crab, crab.

1148
01:03:32,970 --> 01:03:33,670
Appetite, 4.

1149
01:03:35,720 --> 01:03:37,270
Appetite, appetite, appetite, appetite.

1150
01:03:40,200 --> 01:03:41,300
Crab, 5.

1151
01:03:42,800 --> 01:03:44,750
Crab, crab, crab, crab, crab.

1152
01:03:47,100 --> 01:03:48,420
Appetite, 5.

1153
01:03:49,470 --> 01:03:50,720
Appetite, appetite, appetite,

1154
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:55,700
Good work.

1155
01:03:55,700 --> 01:03:56,720
Even so, you improved.

1156
01:03:57,050 --> 01:03:58,070
Tae-hyung wins.

1157
01:04:00,010 --> 01:04:02,100
Now, you can pick starting from the winner.

1158
01:04:02,470 --> 01:04:04,900
So Tae-hyung. The one you honestly want.

1159
01:04:04,900 --> 01:04:09,120
Main bedroom, entry room, loft, living room. And terrace.

1160
01:04:10,870 --> 01:04:11,440
Choose.

1161
01:04:14,980 --> 01:04:16,900
Doing this in the workplace,

1162
01:04:17,550 --> 01:04:18,100
What?

1163
01:04:18,520 --> 01:04:19,720
What? I'm telling him to pick a nice one.

1164
01:04:21,010 --> 01:04:22,270
Do they all have beds?

1165
01:04:22,580 --> 01:04:23,920
Only the main bedroom has a bed.

1166
01:04:26,150 --> 01:04:28,010
Ah, then I'll pick the main bedroom.

1167
01:04:28,920 --> 01:04:34,300
MZ is a Korean term that collectively refers to millenials and Gen Z.

1168
01:04:28,920 --> 01:04:31,240
That's it. That's the MZ spirit.

1169
01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:34,300
These days who tries to read the room with the CEO and stuff.

1170
01:04:34,300 --> 01:04:35,670
If you won, then you won.

1171
01:04:38,470 --> 01:04:39,720
Really? The main bedroom?

1172
01:04:42,870 --> 01:04:43,470
Really?

1173
01:04:45,350 --> 01:04:48,870
If you get really drunk, then I, I'll go and lay you down there.

1174
01:04:53,350 --> 01:04:54,350
What's next? What room?

1175
01:04:55,120 --> 01:04:58,550
Living room, entry room, loft.

1176
01:04:59,750 --> 01:05:00,720
- Does the loft-
- And the terrace.

1177
01:05:01,580 --> 01:05:02,610
Does the loft have a bed?

1178
01:05:02,980 --> 01:05:03,870
I told you, no.

1179
01:05:04,780 --> 01:05:05,980
Then is the other room better?

1180
01:05:06,270 --> 01:05:07,010
The entry room?

1181
01:05:07,150 --> 01:05:10,550
A 'yo' is a traditional Korean mattress designed to be laid on the floor.

1182
01:05:07,150 --> 01:05:08,700
Do you want us to lay a mattress down in the entry room?

1183
01:05:08,980 --> 01:05:10,720
- Alright, then-
- Lay down 2 mattresses.

1184
01:05:12,550 --> 01:05:15,550
Why are you telling me that? Go and lay it yourself!

1185
01:05:20,810 --> 01:05:24,040
Alright, so the CEO has chosen the entry room.

1186
01:05:24,380 --> 01:05:25,500
Next, who was third?

1187
01:05:25,810 --> 01:05:26,320
Me.

1188
01:05:26,580 --> 01:05:27,380
Woo-shik.

1189
01:05:28,180 --> 01:05:29,100
I'll take the living room.

1190
01:05:30,810 --> 01:05:35,870
In that case, we're left with the loft and the terrace.

1191
01:05:39,540 --> 01:05:40,480
I'll sleep in the car.

1192
01:05:40,850 --> 01:05:41,540
What?

1193
01:05:45,310 --> 01:05:46,110
Yu-mi, where do you want to sleep?

1194
01:05:48,620 --> 01:05:50,770
- Do you want the loft or the terrace?
- So sweet. So sweet.

1195
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:54,680
As sweet as his shoulders are wide.

1196
01:05:54,800 --> 01:05:55,620
The loft?

1197
01:05:55,800 --> 01:05:57,850
The loft? Okay, I'll sleep on the terrace.

1198
01:05:59,850 --> 01:06:00,540
I'm okay with it.

1199
01:06:01,110 --> 01:06:03,340
- Are you going to take everything like that?
- I'm really okay with it.

1200
01:06:04,880 --> 01:06:06,170
Alright then,

1201
01:06:06,170 --> 01:06:08,800
We'll come get you for the game for dinner.

1202
01:06:09,360 --> 01:06:11,200
We won't be able to do it in the next hour or two,

1203
01:06:11,200 --> 01:06:13,140
Since we need to prepare, so rest up.

1204
01:06:13,710 --> 01:06:15,570
- At around 8,
- You can't do it in the next 2 hours?

1205
01:06:15,850 --> 01:06:17,220
But I might go to sleep around then.

1206
01:06:19,620 --> 01:06:21,220
What time do you sleep these days?

1207
01:06:21,220 --> 01:06:23,220
It's because of the jet lag.

1208
01:06:23,480 --> 01:06:25,540
I think I need to sleep at 8ish.

1209
01:06:27,370 --> 01:06:28,880
What are you preparing that you need to take that long?

1210
01:06:28,880 --> 01:06:29,820
Weren't you already prepared?

1211
01:06:30,340 --> 01:06:32,110
- We're preparing,
- Just do it straight away.

1212
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:35,080
I'm giving you some time to rest instead of just doing games all day.

1213
01:06:35,450 --> 01:06:38,220
I'll prepare quickly and let you know, so go and rest up.

1214
01:06:39,280 --> 01:06:42,220
Later once you've had a few drinks, who knows where you sleep.

1215
01:06:47,770 --> 01:06:50,400
Seo-joon. Let's sleep together in sleeping bags.

1216
01:06:50,650 --> 01:06:51,250
Alright.

1217
01:06:54,710 --> 01:06:58,020
Again, not romantic love. (Although I ship this).

1218
01:06:54,710 --> 01:06:56,620
- It'd be romantic.
- It's romantic!

1219
01:06:56,770 --> 01:06:58,020
Do you want me to bring a sleeping bag?

1220
01:06:58,020 --> 01:06:58,770
Bring a sleeping bag.

1221
01:06:58,770 --> 01:07:00,570
I think there's only one sleeping bag.

1222
01:07:00,800 --> 01:07:01,820
Yeah, bring it.

1223
01:07:02,310 --> 01:07:04,540
Bring it. Bring it, Park Seo-joon.

1224
01:07:17,570 --> 01:07:19,480
That's not a sleeping bag.

1225
01:07:20,250 --> 01:07:21,940
Why'd you bring a blanket?

1226
01:07:21,940 --> 01:07:22,940
There isn't one.

1227
01:07:28,170 --> 01:07:29,800
Tae-hyung, you want to sleep here too?

1228
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:32,140
Did you put up the protective cover (mosquito net)?

1229
01:07:33,450 --> 01:07:36,400
You need to put it up. There are so many mosquitos.
