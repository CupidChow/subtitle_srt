00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:35,730
Right then, starting from Woo-shik.

165
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:37,530
Let's do it.

166
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:42,900
- Beef,
- Brisket.

167
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:43,630
Correct.

168
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:45,800
- Pyeongyang,
- Naengmyeon.

169
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,560
Correct.

170
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:48,060
- Hamhung,
- Naengmyeon.

171
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:48,730
Correct.

172
00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:51,130
Wall- Wrong!

173
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:54,530
But that was hard.

174
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,960
Wallpaper. Right?

175
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:58,930
Referring specifically to a desktop wallpaper.

176
00:07:57,630 --> 00:07:58,930
That would be correct.

177
00:07:58,930 --> 00:08:00,630
Is there anything other than wallpaper?

178
00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:02,930
I thought it would continuously be naengmyeon.

179
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:07,260
I also thought it'd be food.

180
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:08,830
Since we went so fast,

181
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,600
I thought he was going through a Kbbq restaurant menu.

182
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:15,560
Shall we take this out?

183
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,830
- Fried prawns?
- Yeah, get rid of that.

184
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:18,660
Thanks.

185
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,260
Tae-hyung hasn't gone once.

186
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:21,730
Do you want to come here?

187
00:08:22,030 --> 00:08:23,500
- You come here.
- Alright.

188
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:26,600
You need to play the game too. You like games.

189
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:29,400
But first, let's decide what to remove next.

190
00:08:30,130 --> 00:08:30,860
That.

191
00:08:31,730 --> 00:08:34,730
- That thing. The one Seo-joon made.
- Buckwheat?

192
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:37,930
To be honest, Tae-hyung's in the hardest spot.

193
00:08:37,930 --> 00:08:39,700
Since he goes again right after the last person.

194
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:41,700
Is that going to be alright?

195
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:44,760
Are you ears too covered?

196
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,900
- Is this alright?
- Yeah, this is okay.

197
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,030
Ok, from Woo-shik.

198
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,530
- Three Meals,
- A Day.

199
00:08:56,530 --> 00:08:57,260
Correct.

200
00:08:58,660 --> 00:08:59,900
- Seorae,
- Village.

201
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:00,760
Correct.

202
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:02,930
- Di-
- So.

203
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:06,100
Is Daiso not right?

204
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:08,000
She needs to say 2 characters!

205
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,530
- Oh, it has to be 4?
- Always.

206
00:09:09,530 --> 00:09:10,960
- What's "di-"?
- Diet.

207
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,700
Then the octopus next?

208
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:18,100
- No, the jeon.
- I thought we were removing the soup.

209
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:19,260
The jeon.

210
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:21,160
That's the stuffed squid, not jeon.

211
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:22,960
It's so sad.

212
00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:26,600
The way you're all expecting us to fail.

213
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,360
This, exactly.

214
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,630
CEO. Please give us a cheer.

215
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:34,030
We haven't even been to the end once.

216
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:37,300
Of course we have to think of what to remove first.

217
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:39,930
A staunch realist.

218
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:41,500
Let's get the u-turn.

219
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:45,400
Let's go. Let's go.

220
00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:47,760
Besides, we just need the spiny lobster.

221
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:53,830
- Seafood,
- S-

222
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:56,200
Wrong.

223
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:57,700
Ramyeon. Ramyeon.

224
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:59,960
Seafood ramyeon. Seafood pajeon.

225
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,500
Can I do that again please?

226
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,300
Just this once.

227
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:05,730
I think I'm a bit broken.

228
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:10,730
I told you. Once Woo-shik breaks once, he's like that.

229
00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:12,560
Woo-shik, don't cry.

230
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,100
You can be wrong.

231
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,300
Ska-

232
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,060
What is there?

233
00:10:24,530 --> 00:10:26,400
Are you going to drink plain soju or what?

234
00:10:24,530 --> 00:10:29,400
As in without any accompanying food. All these foods are supposed to go with alcohol.

235
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,400
You're only going to drink plain soju?

236
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:33,630
I'm really sorry. Can we do that again?

237
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:35,630
At this rate, I'd rather I just starve and you all,

238
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,000
Don't think like that.

239
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:41,430
This is a team-building retreat.

240
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:43,900
What? Are you hurt somewhere?

241
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:44,960
I think a mosquito bit me.

242
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:49,330
Let's go.

243
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:52,630
Mala,

244
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:54,800
Xiang guo.

245
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:58,300
Mala xiang guo is a chinese dish that's been really popular in Korea in the last few years.

246
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:58,300
- Xiang guo. Say it now at least.
- Xiang guo!

247
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,230
Oh no, what do we do?

248
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:03,760
He's broken.

249
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:07,400
You, swap seats. Swap seats.

250
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,360
This is bad.

251
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,730
If I sit here, then I'm going to be speaking for the first time.

252
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:17,500
Why do you keep giving Woo-shik hard questions?

253
00:11:18,330 --> 00:11:19,500
That's a hard one.

254
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,060
Oh, are you complaining on behalf of your employee?

255
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:24,260
No, I mean he's in a bad condition, why do you keep?

256
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:33,760
It looks like the lineup's gotten organised. All of the potential candidates are gone.

257
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:37,630
- Even if we eat all this,
- We can't finish this.

258
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:40,400
- Let's go.
- I'm so hot.

259
00:11:47,830 --> 00:11:49,130
- Psick,
- University.

260
00:11:47,830 --> 00:11:50,900
They're a Youtube channel.

261
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:50,230
Correct.

262
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:52,860
- Rocket,
- Four.

263
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:00,560
Is that weird? It's right!

264
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:03,530
- Rocket Four.
- It's right!

265
00:12:03,530 --> 00:12:06,230
Rocket Four!

266
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:12,330
How is that weird? Look it up!

267
00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:15,330
It is correct. We know it.

268
00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:17,930
I think it's a reference to an old Korean comic?

269
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:19,770
Rocket Four, the missile that Na PD saw in a robot comic in his childhood.

270
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,930
It's the biggest and scariest missile.

271
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:19,660
It was supposed to be "rocket delivery".

272
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:27,000
Think Amazon Prime delivery same day or next day delivery but from Coupang, a Korean platform.

273
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:27,000
I don't know what Rocket Delivery is.

274
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:29,330
So Seo-jin passes.

275
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,600
From Yu-mi.

276
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:34,430
- Merry-go-
- Round.

277
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:35,200
Correct.

278
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:36,830
-Inter-
- -ior.

279
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:38,300
In Korean, "Interior" in English specifically refers to "Interior design", hence a noun.

280
00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:37,960
Correct.

281
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:39,760
- Blood Sweat,
- Subtraction.

282
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:40,460
Wrong!

283
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:42,760
- And Tears!
- Blood Sweat and Subtraction.

284
00:12:46,330 --> 00:12:47,560
Subtraction?

285
00:12:50,530 --> 00:12:51,930
Blood Sweat and Subtraction?

286
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:56,100
My blood, sweat and subtraction.

287
00:12:58,560 --> 00:12:59,860
Can I hit him?

288
00:13:04,530 --> 00:13:06,060
Blood Sweat and Subtraction was so funny.

289
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:07,960
Woo-shik can't do anything now. He's in trouble.

290
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:10,060
Are there any other games?

291
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:12,130
But I feel like this is the easiest game.

292
00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:16,260
Woo-shik is having such a tough time, so,

293
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:21,260
What is Woo-shik? He's one of our country's representative actors, isn't he?

294
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:21,900
Surely not,

295
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:24,860
- The lead from .
- This is going to be hard.

296
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:27,030
So, it's going to be 'Complete the drama or film title'.

297
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:28,130
We're screwed.

298
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:29,660
How do we complete it?

299
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,460
Well, for example,

300
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:33,630
- Phoe-
- -nix? Like that?

301
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:35,800
is one of Lee Seo-jin's most iconic works.

302
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,630
- For example, 'Yi',
- San?

303
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:41,360
is also one of his most iconic works, and the origin of "you are the most handsome Joseon king" from .

304
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,300
That's how it goes.

305
00:13:44,530 --> 00:13:47,930
I think I'm going to be bad at this. Can we do one practise round?

306
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:49,530
For example, for Woo-shik, 'Mission'.

307
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:50,800
Impossible.

308
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,500
- There you go.
- He's good in practise.

309
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:55,330
Shall we give Tae-hyung one?

310
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,360
- Itaewon,
- Class.

311
00:13:57,530 --> 00:13:58,330
That's how it goes.

312
00:13:58,330 --> 00:13:59,900
You're giving easy examples right now.

313
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:05,560
He's so good at pulling the wool over your eyes.

314
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:11,800
So, we're doing this?

315
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:12,960
Let's give it a go.

316
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,500
- So it's films?
- Films and dramas.

317
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:19,880
Translations will be official English titles if there is one, literal translations if there isn't one.

318
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:16,500
Films and dramas.

319
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:22,830
- Our beloved,
- Summer.

320
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:24,450
Sang on the soundtrack.

321
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:24,060
Correct.

322
00:14:24,450 --> 00:14:26,640
Starring Choi Woo-shik.

323
00:14:30,030 --> 00:14:31,730
The "us" from 'Blood sweat and subtraction'?

324
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:35,530
Let's go.

325
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:39,060
- Something in,
- Rain.

326
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:40,260
Wrong!

327
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,300
That's right though.

328
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:45,100
Lit. Korean title is "The pretty nuna who buys me food". Seo-jin missed out the "pretty".

329
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:43,530
"The rain".

330
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:45,100
Oh, pretty.

331
00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:50,000
Wow, that's someone's drama.

332
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:52,560
Who is it? Who's the lead?

333
00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:53,930
Son Ye-jin.

334
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:54,630
Yep, she's pretty.

335
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:11,700
Why is he so funny?

336
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:15,100
I'm losing it.

337
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,600
Then you're acknowledging it?

338
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:29,330
Let's go.

339
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,400
- Lady,
- Vengeance.

340
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,400
Correct.

341
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,360
- The Shawshank,
- Redemption.

342
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,030
Correct.

343
00:15:38,330 --> 00:15:41,160
- Suzume's,
- That- Locking up!

344
00:15:38,330 --> 00:15:44,300
English title was just . Korean and Japanese titles literally translate to .

345
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,030
Correct.

346
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:45,060
What did you say?

347
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,700
You don't actually need to lock up.

348
00:15:48,430 --> 00:15:50,060
And it was a push/pull door.

349
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:54,230
Didn't you also just open the door?

350
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:57,060
They have to close the doors, not open.

351
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:00,700
What a relief.

352
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:09,530
- Rude,
- Miss Young-ae.

353
00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:10,100
Correct.

354

- Extraordinary Attorney,
- Woo.

355
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:13,700
Correct.

356
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:23,630
Just for answering that?

357
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:25,860
Do you know how many times he's gotten it wrong?

358
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:29,330
He's gotten 5 wrong in a row and finally got one right.

359
00:16:31,830 --> 00:16:33,630
- Love on a,
- Jujube Tree.

360
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,930
- Josee, the Tiger and,
- The Fish.

361
00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:42,730
Correct!

362
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,160
If you succeed, you can have everything.

363
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:52,660
Again with the- Stop cherry picking the hard ones, you-

364
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:00,900
Watch closely. I'm going to end him in one go.

365
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:03,660
Oi! An old one. Give me an old one.

366
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:05,960
Not a recent one.

367
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:07,730
Why are you so excited?

368
00:17:09,830 --> 00:17:11,160
Alright, let's go.

369
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:17,130
- Be,
- I am melodramatic.

370
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:19,900
Wrong!

371
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:29,730
He's actually made a full sentence where the title isn't in Korean grammar.

372
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:28,230
I feel like I've heard it.

373
00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:29,730
It's just "melodramatic" isn't it?

374
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:31,630
Is it?

375
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:40,530
I am melodramatic.

376
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:45,100
What is it? Melodramatic?

377
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:53,730
I am melodramatic. What is it? ?

378
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:57,600
Na PD is listing other shows which titles are the same full sentence structure like Seo-jin said.

379
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:57,600
Like .

380
00:17:58,130 --> 00:17:59,530
I am Melodramatic.

381
00:18:01,730 --> 00:18:03,200
But what do we remove now?

382
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,260
I'm hungry.

383
00:18:08,530 --> 00:18:09,430
Is it titles again?

384
00:18:09,930 --> 00:18:13,130
But with titles, at least you've come back.

385
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:15,730
- This is better.
- It's harder for me.

386
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,430
But I find films and dramas hard too.

387
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:24,100
But if this Woo-shik stays, then 4 characters is better.

388
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:26,560
Then let's  give it one more try, the 4 characters.

389
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:30,560
4 characters?

390
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:33,230
We have better odds.

391
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:37,560
4 characters.

Crap, there's no good ones. Hang on.

Please. Please just one easy one.

There we go.

416
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,660
I told you we'd end up with 5 dishes.

417
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:35,860
We got 5.

418
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:37,830
We're good.

419
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,730
Good work, good work.

What are we doing?

What are we doing?

Are you just saying that you do for now?

427
00:20:02,430 --> 00:20:05,400
This is why they talk about veterans.

428
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:08,630
Tomorrow, we're just going to do two or three games and wrap.

Two or three tomorrow?

How much footage are you trying to film?

431

Or, how late do you want to sleep?

432
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:17,830
When will you all sleep until?

433
00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:19,830
I think I may need to wake up early either way.

434
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,200
Liar.

435
00:20:22,730 --> 00:20:24,000
So self-serving!

436
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:25,660
Is it just whatever you want?

437
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:29,930
No, that's why I'm asking them. So they can sleep in.

438
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,900
But I'm in a tent,

I missed this.

446
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:08,360
But even with us, we haven't been able to see each other's faces aside from work.

447
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:09,100
Really?

448
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,530
- So we were looking forward to this.
- Me too.

Do you drink soju?

450
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,760
- We'll pour you raspberry wine then.
- There's raspberry wine.

451
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:23,330
But raspberry wine needs to be cold. It tastes better.

452

But these days you seem to be more and more moving towards a comedic character.

453

I'm not doing that on purpose though.

454

I'm not trying to make you laugh.

But even today, he's so reliable.

To be honest, I kept sneaking looks at the dakgalbi as well,

But as soon as he got there, he just started eating.

00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:28,430
I've never heard that song before in my life.

493
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:31,830
Anyway, it waas really romantic.

494
00:26:31,830 --> 00:26:33,600
What was the most romantic?

495
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:36,660
Sleeping in the tent?

496
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:37,860
All 3 of them.

497
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:40,960
Why did all 3 of you go in that tiny tent?

498
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,400
Because Seo-joon told us to all come in.

499
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:45,730
Ahh, the boomer. Park boomer.

500
00:26:45,730 --> 00:26:46,560
No, no.

501
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:50,430
This middle management. This is why Seo-jin trusts you so much.

502
00:26:50,430 --> 00:26:52,430
Since he's got such great control over the kids.

503
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,930
It's nearly Chuseok.

504
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:03,030
For the sake of employee welfare, we're going to play a few games,

505
00:27:03,030 --> 00:27:08,660
And the head office is going to give you some gift cards as a bonus.

506
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:11,400
Hyundai?

507
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:13,430
What is it?

508
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:19,900
There's Shinsegae, Lotte and Hyundai.

509
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:23,000
The three biggest department store chains in Korea.

510
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,000
You can have the one you want.

511
00:27:25,430 --> 00:27:29,360
I, I, I, I, I, I like Lotte lately.

512
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:36,160
So yesterday we did employees vs interns,

513
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:38,530
Now we're going to mix you up.

514
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:40,860
So you're splitting us up again?

515
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:46,060
What sort of team-building involves splitting us up every single time?

516
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:48,430
We're not splitting you up,

517
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:51,000
I mean, for example, yesterday,

518
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:55,060
Woo-shik and Tae-hyung have build up all that friendship, coming all that way.

519
00:27:55,060 --> 00:27:57,060
And then he said "Blood sweat and subtraction".

520
00:27:59,730 --> 00:28:03,630
So now we're going to make teams by combining young and old.

521
00:28:03,830 --> 00:28:05,230
So now, let's pick your partners.

522
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:09,400
Only the employees need to pick, and you are immediately partners.

523
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:10,430
From Yu-mi.

524
00:28:11,130 --> 00:28:12,460
Who is it? Tae-hyung.

525
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:15,360
Alright, Yu-mi and Tae-hyung are one team.

526
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:16,460
Carry me.

527
00:28:17,330 --> 00:28:18,500
The CEO can pick.

528
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:21,900
What are you- Why are you looking?

529
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:25,100
I didn't see.

530
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:27,100
I saw it. I saw it.

531
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:32,360
Who did you put back?

532
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:34,430
No, I just dropped it.

533
00:28:35,730 --> 00:28:38,560
- He saw it, and,
- You just put someone back.

534
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:41,100
Hang on. That's so upsetting.

535
00:28:43,730 --> 00:28:44,500
It was you?

536
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:46,700
No, one person is supposed come out twice.

537
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:49,360
I put it back down because I thought it was overlapping.

538
00:28:50,030 --> 00:28:53,200
One of the interns is supposed to go twice.

539
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:56,230
Because Seo-joon's going to pick too.

540
00:28:56,230 --> 00:28:58,930
- Then their odds go up.
- Oh, is that how it works?

541
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,930
I thought that since Yu-mi already picked Tae-hyung so I put it back.

542
00:29:02,030 --> 00:29:03,900
Oh, so you threw Tae-hyung away?

543
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:07,860
No, since he's on the same team as Yu-mi so I thought, oh this is wrong, and put it back.

544
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:11,160
Since he's already on Yu-mi's team.

545
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:15,260
That's understandable. But it doesn't matter if there's an overlap, so just pick please.

546
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:16,130
Pick again.

547
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,730
I mean Tae-hyung is way better than Woo-shik at games.

548
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:27,800
See? Now it's Woo-shik.

549
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:32,630
Now, Seo-joon can pick.

550
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:34,760
This one.

551
00:29:35,830 --> 00:29:36,700
Woo-shik.

552
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:38,730
Nice, nice.

553
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:43,630
So now, we have Lee Seo-jin's team, Jung Yu-mi's team and Park Seo-joon's team.

554
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:44,960
The genre is,

555
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:47,160
He has so many sketchbooks.

556
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:50,430
Why do you have so many?

557
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,130
The genre is 'speed quiz'.

558
00:29:55,130 --> 00:29:56,760
You all know this,

559
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:59,560
One person explains, the other person guesses.

560
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:01,360
So that's why we've got these?

561
00:30:02,430 --> 00:30:04,060
I've never done this before.

562
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:05,900
Didn't you do it on  back in the day?

563
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:08,300
I've never been on that show.

564
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:09,030
Really?

565
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:11,660
Didn't all the old actors go on that?

566
00:30:11,930 --> 00:30:14,500
The one with the bomb?

567
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:17,960
That's what we're doing. First, we need to decide,

568
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:20,930
Who goes first.

569
00:30:21,030 --> 00:30:22,330
The three of you should play rock paper scissors.

570
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:25,230
Because this can be a touchy subject. Who goes first.

571
00:30:25,230 --> 00:30:26,200
I'll go first.

572
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,160
Yeah, with Woo-shik.

573
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:30,830
Woo-shik, you explain.

574
00:30:30,830 --> 00:30:32,030
No, I can't.

575
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:34,900
The way I see it, the words don't come to mind with you,

576
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:36,030
So it's better for you to explain.

577
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:40,130
But, but,

578
00:30:40,530 --> 00:30:42,500
This, timeout.

579
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:44,430
The cushions.. Not cushions.

580
00:30:44,430 --> 00:30:47,330
See? He can't think of the words.

581
00:30:47,330 --> 00:30:48,500
Okay, I'll explain.

582
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:51,000
Alright, please choose.

583
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:53,660
Oh, we have to pick?

584
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:57,430
Dammit.

585
00:31:00,330 --> 00:31:01,330
Did you choose?

586
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:02,400
Food!

587
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,730
- Not bad.
- That's easy.

588
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:06,330
Is there a time limit?

589
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:08,830
The time limit is 4 minutes.

590
00:31:08,830 --> 00:31:11,100
There are 15 questions,

591
00:31:12,330 --> 00:31:13,430
Hang on before you guess the answers,

592
00:31:13,430 --> 00:31:17,460
Let's have Woo-shik think of a food in his head, and give an example question.

593
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:19,430
Um, it's red,

594
00:31:20,530 --> 00:31:22,060
That, what's it called?

595
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:24,930
This big.

596
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:25,960
Chilli.

597
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:30,630
There's soup, and spring onion, and onion,

598
00:31:30,630 --> 00:31:31,430
Jjamppong?

599
00:31:32,230 --> 00:31:33,600
No. 3 characters.

600
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:35,900
Ddeokbokki.

601
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:37,230
Yes, ddeokbokki.

602
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:46,260
It may actually be better for you to explain.

603
00:31:47,830 --> 00:31:48,530
No, but,

604
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:51,060
It's becuase I'm so unprepared right now.

605
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:52,830
Yeah, he might be good.

606
00:31:54,330 --> 00:31:54,900
Alright.

607
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:56,460
But I think I might know what you mean.

608
00:31:57,330 --> 00:31:58,560
It's this big. Ddeokbokki.

609
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:00,900
Are you going to be alright? Do it?

610
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:01,730
You don't need to swap?

611
00:32:01,730 --> 00:32:03,760
Woo-shik's going to keep explaining?

612
00:32:03,930 --> 00:32:06,300
I still think this is better with him.

613
00:32:06,630 --> 00:32:07,730
Better than guessing the answer.

614
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:12,130
One of Korea's last few authoritative companies, Jinny's Kitchen.

615
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:13,230
How many?

616
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:14,660
15 questions.

617
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:16,230
No, how many gift cards?

618
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:21,860
5 each from the department store of your choosing.

619
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:24,260
That's not bad.

620
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:27,760
But before we start, you're the CEO,

621
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,430
And you're on the same team as our intern,

622
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:33,600
It'd be nice for you to give him some words of encouragement.

623
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:34,060
Do well.

624
00:32:40,430 --> 00:32:42,800
Ready, begin.

625
00:32:44,730 --> 00:32:45,860
Begin.

626
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:50,130
It's four characters.

627
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:53,000
It's made with a fish,

628
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:56,400
Sometimes you put green tea in it and then eat it,

629
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,030
That...

630
00:32:58,930 --> 00:32:59,960
Dried yellow croaker.

631
00:33:02,130 --> 00:33:04,030
This is my favourite food.

632
00:33:07,130 --> 00:33:10,100
It's Italian food,

633
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:13,760
You take several flat things and stack them on top of each other,

634
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:16,060
- Cheese,
- Lasagna.

635
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:16,600
Yes.

636
00:33:20,130 --> 00:33:21,960
This is rice,

637
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:24,760
But in the rice cooker,

638
00:33:25,130 --> 00:33:28,800
You put different vegetables to make the rice,

639
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:29,600
Thistle rice?

640
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:31,200
What's with you?

641
00:33:31,730 --> 00:33:33,730
This, this,

642
00:33:34,060 --> 00:33:36,630
We saw this earlier in the convenience store.

643
00:33:38,630 --> 00:33:39,530
What?

644
00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:42,900
Kimbap.

645
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:44,000
There's the kimbap.

646
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:47,860
Aged kimchi and tuna.

647
00:33:48,130 --> 00:33:49,660
I don't really want kimbap.

648
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:55,230
- We went to buy sandwiches,
- Kimbap?

649
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:58,460
Yes, but you know the ingredients inside,

650
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:02,030
I said, "What about this", but you didn't want it.

651
00:34:02,030 --> 00:34:03,330
Aged kimchi?

652
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:04,930
- Yes.
- Aged kimchi kimbap?

653
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:07,400
But there's another ingredient.

654
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:08,930
Ingredient?

655
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:10,230
It's a fish.

Fish?

What you just said, the fish,

658
00:34:17,230 --> 00:34:19,900
It's a fish, but a really strong fish.

659
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:23,960
It's on the more expensive side.

660

When you go to a sushi restaurant, the most popular one.

661

Are you talking about tuna?

Yes, yes, yes.

Put it together, put it together.

665
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:39,100
Aged kimchi... what is it?

666
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:41,430
- You just said it!
- Aged kimchi tuna.

No,

668

- Aged kimchi and tuna?
- Yes.

And Na PD was like _ _ and I didn't know it.

676

It's a food, but, oh! It's really spicy.

677

It's really spicy and it's 4 characters.

- No, mala, what did you say?

It's "xiang guo"

No.

684
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,760

You have it with pork belly, but not lettuce or perilla leaves.

If you go to really nice restaurants, they all have this.

800
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:42,760
Try it again- myeongyi namul.

801
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:45,730
Instead of "correct",

802
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:50,300
Instead of "correct". What's the opposite of "correct"?

803
00:40:51,530 --> 00:40:52,430
What is it?

804

Um,

811
00:41:12,930 --> 00:41:17,460
Try saying "trash" but pronounce it softly.

Siraegi.

813
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:23,230
I think that was a bit too direct.

814
00:41:23,230 --> 00:41:24,630
That's a warning.

815
00:41:25,060 --> 00:41:26,660
The "rae" was there so it's a warning.

It looks like a small tree.

819
00:41:34,860 --> 00:41:36,500
It's good if you dip it in gochujang?

Carrot?

821
00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:40,200
A small tree.

822
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:41,200
What's a small tree?

00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:43,200
Think of a tree. What does it look like?

824
00:41:43,530 --> 00:41:44,660
It's got roots,

825
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:46,230
Seo-jin, what is it?

826
00:41:51,860 --> 00:41:53,200
Let's pass it and do something else.

827
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:54,030
Pass it.

828
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:58,660
Beginner. Beginner, intermediate. Then what?

829
00:41:58,900 --> 00:41:59,730
Coriander.

830
00:41:58,900 --> 00:42:01,260
Coriander and 'expert' are homophones

831
00:42:00,260 --> 00:42:01,260
Oh, correct.

832
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:04,630
This is really good when you have it with steak.

833
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:05,800
6 characters.

834
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:08,760
You always have this with steak.

835
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:13,200
The name is like a dinosaur.

836
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:14,060
Dinosaur?

837
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:19,330
Don't explode! Don't explode!

838
00:42:23,930 --> 00:42:24,930
That was easy.

839
00:42:24,930 --> 00:42:26,130
The questions were too easy.

840
00:42:28,130 --> 00:42:29,360
Yu-mi and Tae-hyung,

841
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:33,960
Got 8 questions correct.

842
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:36,000
Who's going to guess?

843
00:42:37,030 --> 00:42:38,500
We're discussing it.

844
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:41,730
Do you think you'll be better guessing or explaining?

845
00:42:41,930 --> 00:42:43,300
But you did well explaining.

846
00:42:43,300 --> 00:42:44,700
I'm not confident with either.

847
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:46,560
You should guess this time.

848
00:42:47,260 --> 00:42:48,460
I'm not confident.

849
00:42:49,030 --> 00:42:50,160
Then what are you confident with?

850
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:51,730
What do you want?

851
00:42:51,730 --> 00:42:53,030
Do you want to leave?

852
00:42:56,300 --> 00:42:58,660
I'll explain. I'll explain.

853
00:42:59,630 --> 00:43:00,430
Woo-shik.

854
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:02,960
If they say "corn" as an answer,

855
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:05,930
You can say "something something corn".

856
00:43:06,230 --> 00:43:09,500
Earlier when you were saying the ripe kimchi thing, you never said that, just before, after.

857
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:11,230
Why didn't you say that earlier?

858
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:14,560
Are you resolving your grudges?

859
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:17,230
I'm just saying that you two can do that.

860
00:43:19,300 --> 00:43:20,500
You can do that.

861
00:43:21,730 --> 00:43:25,930
But normally, if it's "super sweet corn" then you can't say corn.

862
00:43:26,060 --> 00:43:29,430
If that's the case, then you should take an answer away from them.

863
00:43:31,460 --> 00:43:32,430
What are you going to do?

864
00:43:34,060 --> 00:43:35,600
You still wouldn't win!

865
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:38,530
Even if you take one away from them, they've got 7.

866
00:43:38,530 --> 00:43:39,860
We need to get 9.

867
00:43:40,930 --> 00:43:42,730
Finally, it's places.

868
00:43:43,100 --> 00:43:43,900
Places?

869
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:47,660
It's not just like provices or city names.

870
00:43:47,660 --> 00:43:50,560
Is it like bathroom or living room?

871
00:43:51,260 --> 00:43:53,060
Are we in the multiverse?

872
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:56,660
Let's begin.

873
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:58,430
Tae-hyung, are you ready?

874
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:00,800
Alright, begin.

875
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:09,460
It's 4 characters.

876
00:44:09,930 --> 00:44:12,460
When we were in Mexico,

877
00:44:13,100 --> 00:44:15,000
Where were we in Mexico?

878
00:44:15,260 --> 00:44:17,000
In Mexico,

879
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:20,200
Alright, let's go one character at a time.

880
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:22,600
The first character is,

881
00:44:22,930 --> 00:44:25,000
- You don't know?
- The first character is,

882
00:44:25,860 --> 00:44:27,560
You don't even care that much for the company?

883
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:30,500
There's that song, right, something something is blowing.

884
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:31,600
The first character.

885
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:32,760
Ba. Ba.

886
00:44:33,330 --> 00:44:34,260
4 characters.

887
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:38,260
You have the first character and you still don't know?

888
00:44:38,260 --> 00:44:39,800
The second character,

889
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:41,930
You know when we laugh, it's like, ha ha ha.

890
00:44:42,100 --> 00:44:45,330
- Baha!
- No, what do we call that laughing?

891
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:48,130
Bacaragua.

892
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:54,230
You're nearly there.

893
00:44:54,430 --> 00:44:55,560
It's an adjective.

894
00:44:56,600 --> 00:44:58,100
Instead of "ha ha ha" laughing,

895
00:45:03,230 --> 00:45:04,360
Pass it.

896
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:06,500
How can you skip this?

897
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:08,200
Quickly.

898
00:45:09,460 --> 00:45:12,700
The place where we always greet the audience at the Megabox.

899
00:45:09,460 --> 00:45:14,130
Megabox is a cinema chain. COEX is a convention centre in Gangnam.

900
00:45:12,700 --> 00:45:14,130
- COEX.
- That's it.

901
00:45:16,130 --> 00:45:18,200
In Seongdong-gu,

902
00:45:18,530 --> 00:45:19,300
Seoul Forest.

903
00:45:23,260 --> 00:45:24,330
In Itaewon,

904
00:45:25,060 --> 00:45:26,430
- In Itaewon,
- 4 characters.

00:45:33,100 --> 00:45:33,800
Misa-ri.

909
00:45:35,860 --> 00:45:37,460
Where's Niseko?

910
00:45:37,460 --> 00:45:38,300
Japan!

911
00:45:38,300 --> 00:45:40,400
- No, the prefecture.
- Hokkaido.

912
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:41,530
- So there,
- Sapporo.

913
00:45:42,730 --> 00:45:43,860
Quickly, quickly.

914
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:48,360
Have you seen ?

915
00:45:50,230 --> 00:45:51,660
Where's Gu Ma-jeok?

916
00:45:50,230 --> 00:45:53,060
A character from .

917
00:45:51,660 --> 00:45:53,060
How am I supposed to know?

Next to Eulji-ro.

919
00:45:55,160 --> 00:45:57,230
Next to Eulji-ro.. Myeondong.

2 characters.

921

Jung, jung...

922
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:00,800
Similar.

923
00:46:01,330 --> 00:46:02,630
How is it similar?

924
00:46:05,500 --> 00:46:06,400
Pass, pass.

925
00:46:07,930 --> 00:46:09,530

Hey, flip it quickly.

930
00:46:21,100 --> 00:46:22,460
Oh, but this is,

931
00:46:22,900 --> 00:46:25,360
What's the subway stop near Yeoksam-dong?

932
00:46:25,730 --> 00:46:28,160
- Near Yeoksam-dong?
- Near where you lived.

933
00:46:29,460 --> 00:46:30,700
Pass, pass, pass.

00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:01,260
Bacalar. It was Bacalar.

00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:03,330
How didn't you know that?

944
00:47:05,100 --> 00:47:06,960
You did so well but how did you not know that one?

945
00:47:08,860 --> 00:47:09,900
You were good.

946
00:47:09,900 --> 00:47:10,860
They've won then.

947
00:47:11,030 --> 00:47:12,330
Yeah, I think they won.

948
00:47:12,330 --> 00:47:16,060
Seo-joon and Woo-shik, got a whopping 10 questions and came first.

949
00:47:20,260 --> 00:47:21,730
Now, which department store would you like?

950
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:24,430
The place closest to my house is,

951
00:47:27,260 --> 00:47:29,500
My mum goes to Hyundai a lot,

952
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:30,900
Alright, Hyundai. And Woo-shik?

953
00:47:30,900 --> 00:47:32,060
I'll go with Hyundai.

954
00:47:32,060 --> 00:47:33,030
Hyundai for you too.

955
00:47:33,700 --> 00:47:36,100
Alright, half and half. Congratulations.

956
00:47:36,100 --> 00:47:38,100
Thank you, thank you.

957
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:45,360
So anyway, this was the warm up.

958
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:47,800
Now we're going to properly get into the athletic meet.

959
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:49,800
Please stay and rest for a moment in the lobyy,

960
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:51,500
We'll just set up the cameras and you can come in.

961
00:47:52,130 --> 00:47:53,160
That was good.

962
00:48:17,250 --> 00:48:19,450
[13:00: Athletic Meet]

963
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:21,960
Finally, the athletic meet with the staff.

964
00:48:22,260 --> 00:48:23,960
This is our last event.

965
00:48:25,030 --> 00:48:29,130
Including those in the yard- Yu-mi are you angry?

966
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:30,260
No.

967
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:32,100
That was such a defiant posture.

968
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:36,960
It'll be a competition between yourselves and the staff.

969
00:48:37,300 --> 00:48:42,500
If you win, then we'll pay for the next get together.

970
00:48:44,830 --> 00:48:48,830
If we win, then you will pay for the next get together.

971
00:48:49,230 --> 00:48:51,960
I'm sure that out of you all, Seo-jin will pay. Probably.

972
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:01,260
What kind of team building retreat is this?

973
00:49:04,030 --> 00:49:05,500
How is this team building?

974
00:49:08,130 --> 00:49:08,860
He's not wrong.

975
00:49:10,700 --> 00:49:13,160
But normally, you pay anyway.

976
00:49:13,630 --> 00:49:15,260
Now we're saying that we might pay this time.

977
00:49:15,500 --> 00:49:16,800
First, I'll reveal our events.

978
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:19,530

We're in trouble.

It's first team to 2 wins.

983
00:49:31,560 --> 00:49:34,760
For shoe archery, 3 people.

984
00:49:35,500 --> 00:49:36,930
Table tennis is doubles. 2 people.

985
00:49:37,160 --> 00:49:38,700
So please select those people first.

986
00:49:38,700 --> 00:49:39,630
Oh, is table tennis doubles?

987
00:49:40,130 --> 00:49:43,000
According to your selections, we'll reveal our line up too.

- Me too.

989
00:49:48,230 --> 00:49:49,200
Woo-shik, you're bad at table tennis, aren't you?

990
00:49:49,530 --> 00:49:51,130
I'm not bad.

991
00:49:51,130 --> 00:49:52,600
- Oh, really?
- Yeah, he's good.

992
00:49:54,530 --> 00:49:57,160
- No, I'm bad.
- No, he's good at table tennis.

993
00:49:57,660 --> 00:49:58,660
How do you know?

994
00:49:58,660 --> 00:50:01,000
But Woo-shik is pretty good at aggravating the others.

995
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:01,830
No, I can't.

996
00:50:01,830 --> 00:50:03,000
No, I've seen him.

997
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,160
Then who's better at table tennis between you two?

998
00:50:04,630 --> 00:50:05,760
Tae-hyung is better.

999
00:50:07,930 --> 00:50:10,400
I've never even played with you.

1000
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:11,100
He's good.

1001
00:50:12,900 --> 00:50:14,800
Then what? Who's going to do the shoes?

1002
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:16,030
You two are doing the shoes for sure,

1003
00:50:16,030 --> 00:50:17,130
Are you good at table tennis?

1004
00:50:19,460 --> 00:50:20,360
Looks like he's pretty good.

1005
00:50:20,630 --> 00:50:22,260
But it's been a long time since I've played.

1006
00:50:22,260 --> 00:50:24,260
Guess he's pretty good. Guess he wants to play table tennis.

1007
00:50:24,260 --> 00:50:25,700
He's confident.

1008
00:50:28,060 --> 00:50:29,460
He's pretty confident.

1009
00:50:29,460 --> 00:50:31,360
It's the first time I've seen him like this.

1010
00:50:32,060 --> 00:50:33,700
So just quickly do the shoes.

1011
00:50:35,060 --> 00:50:36,600
So is it the three of you for the shoes?

1012
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:40,530
Then we'll match the gender ratios with our representatives.

1013
00:50:40,530 --> 00:50:41,160
Who is it?

1014
00:50:41,730 --> 00:50:43,300
We'll go with these.

1015
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:46,900
Players, enter.

1016
00:50:54,030 --> 00:50:55,260
But they look like they'd be really good.

1017
00:50:57,730 --> 00:50:58,630
Hang on.

1018
00:50:59,260 --> 00:51:01,000
Please introduce yourselves first.

1019
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,400
Starting from Seon-woo in front,

1020
00:51:03,730 --> 00:51:05,600
Hello, I'm Seon-woo from the audio team.

1021
00:51:08,430 --> 00:51:11,130
I'll just ask Seon-woo a couple of things,

1022
00:51:11,130 --> 00:51:14,330
How long have you been with us?

1023
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:16,300
It's been about 10 years

1024
00:51:15,330 --> 00:51:17,900
List of all the shows he's done with Seo-jin alone.

1025
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:17,900
It's been about 10 years.

1026
00:51:18,260 --> 00:51:22,200
"If I say this, then I can immediately send Lee Seo-jin to Dallas".

1027
00:51:22,730 --> 00:51:24,730
How many of these secret stories do you have?

1028
00:51:26,560 --> 00:51:27,900
Do you? Do you?

1029
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:30,560
Several.

1030
00:51:33,730 --> 00:51:36,200
For all this time, Seon-woo has only been listening.

1031
00:51:37,730 --> 00:51:40,160
If he speaks, we're all done for.

1032
00:51:42,530 --> 00:51:43,960
And then, next to him,

1033
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:47,230
Hello, I'm Han Yu-jin PD.

1034
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:50,530
She looks like she'll be really good.

1035
00:51:50,530 --> 00:51:55,100
Yu-jin has been doing Earth Arcade as well,

1036
00:51:55,500 --> 00:52:00,660
So she's generally very competitive.

1037
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:05,000
- And then finally,
- Wait, but aren't we at too much of a disadvantage?

1038
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:05,500
What?

1039
00:52:06,360 --> 00:52:08,400
You've got the grim reaper on your side.

1040
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:13,760
He's just a local bee keeper.

1041
00:52:14,430 --> 00:52:18,160
- The grim reaper,
- No, he's just a beekeeper.

1042
00:52:19,300 --> 00:52:20,530
He's wearing football pants though.

1043
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:22,300
Please introduce yourself.

1044
00:52:22,300 --> 00:52:24,100
Hello, I'm Lee Jun-young from the heli team.

1045
00:52:26,700 --> 00:52:29,200
You know him right, our helicam director.

1046
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:31,060
- He's Hyeon-soo's,
- Son.

1047
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:31,060
The main helicam director.

1048
00:52:31,330 --> 00:52:32,200
Oh, really?

1049
00:52:33,630 --> 00:52:38,230
He's the son of a conglomerate family, earning his stripes.

1050
00:52:38,430 --> 00:52:39,360
Is your father well?

1051
00:52:42,100 --> 00:52:43,800
Wasn't he in Mexico too?

1052
00:52:44,060 --> 00:52:45,830
He was with us in Mexico, wasn't he?

1053
00:52:48,030 --> 00:52:49,100
So it will be 3v3.

1054
00:52:50,560 --> 00:52:55,960
The celebrities will aim for the far target, and our staff, the near target.

1055
00:52:56,560 --> 00:52:57,700
How many attempts do we get?

1056
00:52:57,700 --> 00:53:01,300
It will be a best of 3 sets.

1057
00:53:01,700 --> 00:53:03,660
If your shoe lands on the other team's target,

1058
00:53:03,930 --> 00:53:04,800
Then that's just their points.

1059
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:10,300
Then quickly check the wind direction.

1060
00:53:10,530 --> 00:53:12,660
You can all practise once each.

1061
00:53:12,660 --> 00:53:13,800
I want to try.

1062
00:53:14,860 --> 00:53:16,230
It needs to drop here.

1063
00:53:16,500 --> 00:53:18,160
Yeah, it has to drop on the green edge.

1064
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:28,600
That's the other team's.

1065
00:53:30,930 --> 00:53:32,030
But we have hope.

1066
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:33,500
We have hope.

1067
00:53:34,300 --> 00:53:36,530
Our staff should have a go each as well.

1068
00:53:36,530 --> 00:53:38,900
- Did you step on the line?
- So serious.

1069
00:53:49,830 --> 00:53:54,000
Sun-woo, attack back! Tell your stories.

1070
00:53:58,560 --> 00:53:59,600
Look at Yu-jin's expression.

1071
00:54:02,500 --> 00:54:03,300
She's good.

1072
00:54:10,030 --> 00:54:12,700
Yeah, like that, like that.

1073
00:54:13,160 --> 00:54:15,460
The points will be where the line is.

1074
00:54:15,600 --> 00:54:17,400
Where the shoe is closest to the centre.

1075
00:54:26,500 --> 00:54:27,330
Fair play, fair play.

1076
00:54:29,930 --> 00:54:31,830
Alright, Seo-joon to start. Good luck.

1077
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:39,400
Why am I nervous?

1078
00:54:40,560 --> 00:54:41,700
It's okay.

1079
00:54:42,060 --> 00:54:42,730
I'm going.

1080
00:54:46,660 --> 00:54:47,500
0 points!

1081
00:54:49,230 --> 00:54:50,460
- It's 0 points.
- It's okay, it's okay.

1082
00:54:50,460 --> 00:54:51,860
It was similar.

1083
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:58,830
0 points.

1084
00:55:02,560 --> 00:55:03,900
Too much spin.

1085
00:55:06,700 --> 00:55:07,460
Woo-shik.

1086
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:19,560
That side again.

1087
00:55:22,830 --> 00:55:23,760
Our heli director.

1088
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:28,200
This won't do.

1089
00:55:37,430 --> 00:55:39,200
40 points. It's 40 points.

1090
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:44,160
How did it go in like that?

1091
00:55:49,860 --> 00:55:51,960
Yu-mi absolutely must score.

1092
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:54,660
Nice.

1093
00:55:57,600 --> 00:55:58,430
0 points.

1094
00:55:58,760 --> 00:56:02,560
In that case, set 1 is a win for the staff.

1095
00:56:05,900 --> 00:56:07,800
This is pretty straightforward.

1096
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,900
But this is totally, just luck.

1097
00:56:10,900 --> 00:56:11,600
Right?

1098
00:56:12,030 --> 00:56:13,530
You're even worse than expected.

1099
00:56:14,330 --> 00:56:15,300
I thought it was similar.

1100
00:56:15,630 --> 00:56:18,030
You have the grim reaper, how are we supposed to win?

1101
00:56:18,730 --> 00:56:20,030
You haven't gone, so you go.

1102
00:56:20,500 --> 00:56:21,630
The winning team starts.

1103
00:56:24,360 --> 00:56:25,900
She scored earlier didn't she?

1104
00:56:26,830 --> 00:56:27,860
Wait, wait.

1105
00:56:28,330 --> 00:56:29,900
You can't step on the line.

1106
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:37,030
We agreed to play fair earlier.

1107
00:56:45,030 --> 00:56:46,430
Out, out.

1108
00:56:52,060 --> 00:56:53,360
No points again.

1109
00:56:55,500 --> 00:56:56,730
Heli director.

1110
00:57:00,100 --> 00:57:01,300
Oh, good backspin.

1111
00:57:02,360 --> 00:57:04,430
40 points! 40 points.

1112
00:57:08,460 --> 00:57:09,660
40 again?

1113
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:19,860
Choi Woo-shik. Nervous?

1114
00:57:20,100 --> 00:57:21,030
It's okay, it's okay.

1115
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:22,860
Oh, nice.

1116
00:57:29,400 --> 00:57:31,530
60 points. No, 80. 80 points.

1117
00:57:36,330 --> 00:57:37,560
Don't touch it.

1118
00:57:40,030 --> 00:57:41,560
Sun-woo, you need at least 40.

1119
00:57:49,730 --> 00:57:51,430
Out. That's it.

1120
00:57:52,530 --> 00:57:54,630
In that case, it's 1-1.

1121
00:57:54,860 --> 00:57:55,960
Now it's the final.

1122
00:57:56,330 --> 00:57:57,660
That was good.

1123
00:57:59,460 --> 00:58:00,400
Good job.

1124
00:58:04,300 --> 00:58:05,930
Make a plan.

1125
00:58:06,030 --> 00:58:07,760
- Yu-mi first?
- What order are we doing?

1126
00:58:08,930 --> 00:58:09,760
Should I go second then?

1127
00:58:10,260 --> 00:58:11,530
Seo-joon, you go first.

1128
00:58:11,830 --> 00:58:13,360
- Me?
- Yeah.

1129
00:58:14,200 --> 00:58:15,130
Are we first?

1130
00:58:15,130 --> 00:58:16,060
Well, yes, sure.

1131
00:58:19,700 --> 00:58:21,430
It went left earlier.

1132
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:24,530
I need to adjust my aim.

1133
00:58:27,730 --> 00:58:28,360
Oh, nice.

1134
00:58:29,230 --> 00:58:30,160
That's it.

1135
00:58:32,260 --> 00:58:32,800
80 points.

1136
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:33,800
80 points, 80 points.

1137
00:58:35,460 --> 00:58:37,230
Since he has big feet.

1138
00:58:45,630 --> 00:58:47,300
- You can do it, Sun-woo.
- Director!

1139
00:58:49,330 --> 00:58:50,330
40 points.

1140
00:58:50,330 --> 00:58:52,430
It's 40 points. Not bad, not bad.

1141
00:58:54,630 --> 00:58:57,400
As long as you don't hit his shoe.

1142
00:58:58,260 --> 00:58:59,630
- Oh, nice, nice.
- Get in.

1143
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:08,830
40 points! 40 points!

1144
00:59:08,830 --> 00:59:11,130
Thank you! Thank you!

1145
00:59:13,730 --> 00:59:15,100
40 points!

1146
00:59:15,100 --> 00:59:17,130
Thank you! Thank you!

1147
00:59:19,560 --> 00:59:24,100
Jung Yu-mi! Jung Yu-mi! Jung Yu-mi!

1148
00:59:24,100 --> 00:59:26,560
It's a tie. A tie.

1149
00:59:30,560 --> 00:59:32,600
It's becuase my shoes are small.

1150
00:59:42,660 --> 00:59:43,660
Nice.

1151
00:59:44,630 --> 00:59:46,200
Just score.

1152
00:59:46,430 --> 00:59:47,230
Finally,

1153
00:59:57,060 --> 00:59:58,030
0 points.

1154
01:00:04,660 --> 01:00:06,100
Oh, Yu-jin hasn't gone?

1155
01:00:06,860 --> 01:00:08,260
Then we can win.

1156
01:00:09,830 --> 01:00:12,960
If Yu-jin gets even 10 points, then we win.

1157
01:00:27,160 --> 01:00:28,400
What was that?

1158
01:00:30,730 --> 01:00:32,930
That was nearly bad!

1159
01:00:37,660 --> 01:00:38,600
Extension?

1160
01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:41,060
- Extend it.
- Again.

1161
01:00:42,330 --> 01:00:43,830
Jung Yu-mi, thank you.

1162
01:00:44,930 --> 01:00:48,500
She's a PD, right? She's here as a representative of all of you right?

1163
01:00:48,500 --> 01:00:49,400
Yep.

1164
01:00:50,930 --> 01:00:53,160
Sorry, but please don't speak to our athletes.

1165
01:00:53,600 --> 01:00:54,860
Tell them to go first.

1166
01:00:55,100 --> 01:00:56,660
Since we went first last time.

1167
01:00:57,830 --> 01:00:58,900
Yu-jin first.

1168
01:01:14,060 --> 01:01:15,660
Nice, nice.

1169
01:01:16,160 --> 01:01:17,860
Nice, nice.

1170
01:01:20,830 --> 01:01:22,800
40 points.

1171
01:01:23,200 --> 01:01:24,330
That's how you do it.

1172
01:01:25,500 --> 01:01:26,430
He's good.

1173
01:01:30,430 --> 01:01:31,760
Just the edge.

1174
01:01:32,460 --> 01:01:33,560
Ah, Yu-mi...

1175
01:01:35,460 --> 01:01:36,630
Wait,

1176
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:40,160
Oh, nice, nice.

1177
01:01:47,730 --> 01:01:50,700
If Sun-woo can't get at least 40,

1178
01:02:08,500 --> 01:02:10,260
Good job. Good job.

1179
01:02:14,430 --> 01:02:16,330
But, it's okay.

1180
01:02:18,900 --> 01:02:20,260
It's okay.

1181
01:02:20,630 --> 01:02:21,930
But that is..

1182
01:02:22,530 --> 01:02:25,030
100 to 40. If he gets above 60,

1183
01:02:26,330 --> 01:02:27,860
Seo-joon hadn't gone yet?

1184
01:02:27,860 --> 01:02:28,900
He's not going again?

1185
01:02:36,260 --> 01:02:37,330
Long, long.

1186
01:02:39,730 --> 01:02:41,630
It's over!

1187
01:02:42,830 --> 01:02:44,230
It's okay, it's okay.

1188
01:02:48,230 --> 01:02:51,800
Staff vs celebrities. Staff lead 1-0.

1189
01:02:55,100 --> 01:02:55,830
That was a shame.

1190
01:02:56,830 --> 01:02:58,400
The second event is table tennis.

1191
01:03:10,230 --> 01:03:11,160
They're good.

1192
01:03:12,600 --> 01:03:13,300
Nice.

1193
01:03:15,500 --> 01:03:17,260
How long has it been since you've played table tennis?

1194
01:03:18,500 --> 01:03:20,000
This is the first time since .

1195
01:03:27,800 --> 01:03:29,130
You guys are cool.

1196
01:03:29,930 --> 01:03:31,200
Hyun-young PD is good.

1197
01:03:33,600 --> 01:03:34,600
Dae-ju's coming out.

1198
01:03:34,930 --> 01:03:35,860
Dae-ju, are you playing?

1199
01:03:35,860 --> 01:03:38,230
It'll be Dae-ju and Park Hyun-young.

1200
01:03:39,100 --> 01:03:41,830
Sorry, but warm up time is over. Please come out.

1201
01:03:42,230 --> 01:03:45,200
Seo-joon, can you please keep the score.

1202
01:03:45,400 --> 01:03:46,430
How many points are we playing?

1203
01:03:46,430 --> 01:03:47,830
3 sets of 11 points.

1204
01:03:47,830 --> 01:03:49,030
- We're on this side.
- Good luck.

1205
01:03:50,600 --> 01:03:51,530
Good Luck.

1206
01:03:53,300 --> 01:03:56,100
And our Park Hyun-young PD has made a pledge.

1207
01:03:56,300 --> 01:03:57,500
If he loses,

1208
01:03:58,060 --> 01:04:01,630
He will edit at least 40 minutes worth of air-time per episode.

1209
01:04:01,900 --> 01:04:03,660
He's promised his juniors.

1210
01:04:03,900 --> 01:04:06,050
News to him.

1211
01:04:08,430 --> 01:04:09,960
- Serve.
- You guys?

1212
01:04:11,560 --> 01:04:13,630
We're starting. Good luck.

1213
01:04:19,730 --> 01:04:20,430
No-

1214
01:04:33,860 --> 01:04:36,030
Rocket 4, launch!

1215
01:04:46,730 --> 01:04:47,400
Dammit.

1216
01:04:56,300 --> 01:04:57,460
The wind.

1217
01:05:15,660 --> 01:05:17,460
You can't smash that.

1218
01:05:21,360 --> 01:05:22,300
Good luck.

1219
01:05:22,500 --> 01:05:24,030
11 points a set, this is only set 1.

1220
01:05:24,230 --> 01:05:25,500
Aren't we only playing 1 set?

1221
01:05:25,500 --> 01:05:26,160
It's 3 sets.

1222
01:05:26,600 --> 01:05:28,760
That's so tiring. Who plays 3 sets?

1223
01:05:31,300 --> 01:05:33,500
You need to play 3 sets as a base.

1224
01:05:34,260 --> 01:05:35,460
This is tiring.

1225
01:05:47,600 --> 01:05:50,060
Seo-jin's gotten caught. He's starting to run out of stamina.

1226
01:06:01,530 --> 01:06:04,000
Rocket 4, launch!

1227
01:06:12,630 --> 01:06:13,760
I think we're going to win.

1228
01:06:19,830 --> 01:06:22,760
Rocket 4, launch!

1229
01:06:37,430 --> 01:06:38,360
How many?

1230
01:06:44,260 --> 01:06:45,160
It's okay. It's okay.

1231
01:06:49,700 --> 01:06:50,330
Good luck!

1232
01:06:52,260 --> 01:06:53,460
Park Hyun-young, good luck!

1233
01:07:01,430 --> 01:07:02,200
Game, game.

1234
01:07:12,330 --> 01:07:14,460
Looking at the flow, we've already won.

1235
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:15,860
Let's go.

1236
01:07:16,160 --> 01:07:17,500
Let's begin.

1237
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:49,800
Tae-hyung's collapsing.

1238
01:07:51,230 --> 01:07:53,460
- Tae-hyung, it's okay.
- Relax. Relax.

1239
01:07:57,030 --> 01:07:59,730
The wind is irregular.

1240
01:08:10,560 --> 01:08:11,500
That's it.

1241
01:08:11,500 --> 01:08:12,760
We're going to a final.

1242
01:08:17,830 --> 01:08:19,800
You really are blood sweat and subtraction.

1243
01:08:19,800 --> 01:08:21,530
You're subtracting your blood and sweat.

1244
01:08:24,300 --> 01:08:26,030
If the staff win, it's over.

1245
01:08:43,960 --> 01:08:45,130
What are you doing?

1246
01:08:45,130 --> 01:08:46,200
Where are you hiding?

1247
01:08:47,130 --> 01:08:48,660
What was that?

1248
01:08:48,660 --> 01:08:49,930
Did something just go by?

1249
01:09:04,860 --> 01:09:07,260
Editing. Editing. Editing.

1250
01:09:08,500 --> 01:09:10,400
Why did you suddenly say that about the editing?

1251
01:09:16,760 --> 01:09:17,660
It's okay.

1252
01:09:21,330 --> 01:09:22,500
We weren't ready.

1253
01:09:28,460 --> 01:09:30,360
Those manners,

1254
01:09:30,830 --> 01:09:33,630
No, I mean you should've said something.

1255
01:09:58,160 --> 01:09:59,930
Why do you keep chopping?

1256
01:09:59,930 --> 01:10:01,330
They can't return my chops.

1257
01:10:02,200 --> 01:10:03,460
He said you can't return his chops.

1258
01:10:06,430 --> 01:10:07,600
That's it.

1259
01:10:13,460 --> 01:10:16,160
Tae-hyung, calm down, calm down.

1260
01:10:35,800 --> 01:10:37,960
That was close. Slow it down. Calmly.

1261
01:10:40,160 --> 01:10:41,430
Show us your killer move.

1262
01:10:47,600 --> 01:10:48,460
Oh, sorry.

1263
01:10:57,860 --> 01:10:58,800
It's a comeback.

1264
01:11:02,530 --> 01:11:03,630
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

1265
01:11:03,630 --> 01:11:05,530
Let's.. calmly, calmly.

1266
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:07,630
Slowly.

1267
01:11:27,760 --> 01:11:29,160
This is so nerve wracking.

1268
01:11:39,060 --> 01:11:40,060
That's it.

1269
01:11:42,130 --> 01:11:43,360
10-9.

1270
01:12:00,460 --> 01:12:01,700
It's deuce. Deuce.

1271
01:12:02,400 --> 01:12:04,730
Win by two.

1272
01:12:18,900 --> 01:12:20,200
I thought that was out.

1273
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:42,560
Then in that case,

1274
01:12:43,560 --> 01:12:47,000
The staff win 12 to 10.

1275
01:12:53,260 --> 01:12:54,100
You did well though.

1276
01:12:54,100 --> 01:12:55,360
What a shame.

1277
01:13:01,230 --> 01:13:04,700
Then in that case, our next staff get together, Seo-jin is buying.

1278
01:13:07,730 --> 01:13:09,130
This is supposed to be the end,

1279
01:13:09,730 --> 01:13:11,500
But we still have a few gift cards left.

1280
01:13:11,830 --> 01:13:15,560
How about we put 1 million won's worth of gift cards on the line, and do group skipping?

1281
01:13:16,130 --> 01:13:17,130
Sure.

1282
01:13:17,330 --> 01:13:18,430
Of course.

1283
01:13:18,760 --> 01:13:20,830
- One last game.
- You only have 1 million left?

1284
01:13:23,130 --> 01:13:25,130
You have 2 million though. Just bet it.

1285
01:13:25,800 --> 01:13:29,700
- You knew that?
- Alright, let's go.

1286
01:13:35,460 --> 01:13:39,230
It'll be the same 5 people vs you 5. We'll put them together.

1287
01:13:44,230 --> 01:13:46,230
Players on our side will get the same gift cards if they win.

1288
01:13:46,230 --> 01:13:49,000
Sun-woo. This is a chance to show off to your wife.

1289
01:13:49,260 --> 01:13:51,330
The count starts once all 5 people are in, right?

1290
01:13:51,330 --> 01:13:52,100
Yep, yep.

1291
01:13:53,660 --> 01:13:54,800
I'm the problem here.

1292
01:13:56,100 --> 01:13:56,760
I'm the problem.

1293
01:13:56,760 --> 01:13:58,960
The timing is, 1, 2, 3,

1294
01:14:01,060 --> 01:14:02,130
We'll have to take off our hats.

1295
01:14:03,560 --> 01:14:05,030
Once you go in, it's,

1296
01:14:10,800 --> 01:14:11,660
Oh they're good.

1297
01:14:12,200 --> 01:14:14,230
What's this?

1298
01:14:26,760 --> 01:14:28,100
Nice, just do that.

1299
01:14:28,100 --> 01:14:29,230
Stop showing them.

1300
01:14:29,500 --> 01:14:30,530
Try going in.

1301
01:14:30,860 --> 01:14:32,430
They just practised.

1302
01:14:32,830 --> 01:14:34,360
Let's try.

1303
01:14:34,700 --> 01:14:37,330
I'll go in first, so you try following me.

1304
01:14:41,630 --> 01:14:43,160
Do you have to go in that way?

1305
01:14:43,160 --> 01:14:43,660
No.

1306
01:14:44,130 --> 01:14:45,460
Do you have to go in that way?

1307
01:14:45,460 --> 01:14:46,660
No. It doesn't matter.

1308
01:14:47,560 --> 01:14:48,760
Which ever way is easier for you.

1309
01:14:49,060 --> 01:14:51,630
You have to go in quickly. You can't hesitate.

1310
01:14:52,700 --> 01:14:53,500
You can't do that.

1311
01:14:53,500 --> 01:14:55,160
- You have to go straight in.
- Alright.

1312
01:14:55,160 --> 01:14:55,900
Watch.

1313
01:14:58,030 --> 01:14:58,600
Now.

1314
01:15:01,460 --> 01:15:02,300
Try it.

1315
01:15:02,860 --> 01:15:05,300
That's it. Come into the middle.

1316
01:15:10,600 --> 01:15:11,700
Come here.

1317
01:15:16,430 --> 01:15:17,430
How do you go in?

1318
01:15:24,230 --> 01:15:24,800
That's it.

1319
01:15:32,160 --> 01:15:33,160
Where do I go in?

1320
01:15:33,160 --> 01:15:33,800
Over there.

1321
01:15:33,800 --> 01:15:34,600
Where? Where?

1322
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:37,830
Here. In front of Seo-jin.

1323
01:15:43,230 --> 01:15:45,500
I think you have to go in first.

1324
01:15:45,730 --> 01:15:48,800
- Oh wait, no, no.
- Then she has to keep jumping.

1325
01:15:48,800 --> 01:15:51,700
Then we have to leave the centre with some space for Yu-mi to come in.

1326
01:15:52,330 --> 01:15:53,560
Or let's just remove her.

1327
01:15:54,230 --> 01:15:57,830
Yeah, remove me. Remove me.

1328
01:15:58,260 --> 01:15:59,600
Say I've gone to take a poop.

1329
01:15:59,600 --> 01:16:00,660
Yeah, just go.

1330
01:16:04,100 --> 01:16:07,560
Once you're in, it's just 1, 2, 1, 2. It's always that rhythm.

1331
01:16:07,560 --> 01:16:08,400
Ok.

1332
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:10,300
Are you ready?

1333
01:16:10,630 --> 01:16:11,730
Are you done practising?

1334
01:16:11,960 --> 01:16:13,600
Then the staff will go first.

1335
01:16:14,730 --> 01:16:15,600
Good luck!

1336
01:16:40,160 --> 01:16:41,700
2 times. 2.

1337
01:16:42,030 --> 01:16:42,930
You didn't get over.

1338
01:16:43,230 --> 01:16:45,230
- That's alright.
- But, but,

1339
01:16:45,600 --> 01:16:47,330
You can come slowly.

1340
01:16:47,330 --> 01:16:48,460
But they just,

1341
01:16:48,460 --> 01:16:50,130
asdvferghqw

1342
01:16:50,130 --> 01:16:51,500
No, it doesn't need to be single file.

1343
01:16:51,500 --> 01:16:54,000
No, but doing it like that seems easier.

1344
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:55,100
No, no, no.

1345
01:16:55,100 --> 01:16:57,060
You just need to come in on the timing you want.

1346
01:16:57,430 --> 01:17:00,000
I guess coming in from this side is easier.

1347
01:17:03,100 --> 01:17:04,900
- Practise it then.
- You do that then.

1348
01:17:07,200 --> 01:17:08,200
Who's going to go first?

1349
01:17:08,430 --> 01:17:09,200
I'll go first.

1350
01:17:09,200 --> 01:17:10,460
- Then?
- Then I'll go.

1351
01:17:10,460 --> 01:17:12,230
Then? Woo-shik?

1352
01:17:12,230 --> 01:17:12,760
Sure.

1353
01:17:12,760 --> 01:17:14,430
Third? Then I'm fourth.

1354
01:17:14,430 --> 01:17:15,460
Yu-mi fifth.

1355
01:17:16,330 --> 01:17:18,530
I think coming in from this side will be easier.

1356
01:17:20,430 --> 01:17:22,400
This is the last match of the athletic meet.

1357
01:17:22,900 --> 01:17:27,460
If you lose here, then it's a clean sweep.

1358
01:17:30,600 --> 01:17:31,660
If you're ready, we'll get going.

1359
01:17:31,830 --> 01:17:34,130
Wait, where do we go in from.

1360
01:17:34,130 --> 01:17:34,700
It doesn't matter.

1361
01:17:34,700 --> 01:17:36,830
The way I see it, i guess it's easier to come in from here.

1362
01:17:37,800 --> 01:17:38,760
It's more comfortable for me from here.

1363
01:17:38,760 --> 01:17:41,000
- Alright, then,
- Just go in from wherever you want.

1364
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:43,330
Just go in and leave space for the others.

1365
01:17:43,330 --> 01:17:44,500
I'll go here then.

1366
01:17:44,700 --> 01:17:46,300
Okay, then I'll come right behind you.

1367
01:17:48,300 --> 01:17:49,830
I thought you were third.

1368
01:17:49,830 --> 01:17:50,830
Am I third?

1369
01:17:50,830 --> 01:17:52,660
- Tae-hyung's second.
- Oh you're second?

1370
01:17:53,600 --> 01:17:54,860
Why are you nervous?

1371
01:17:58,300 --> 01:17:59,230
Let's go.

1372
01:18:10,960 --> 01:18:11,930
- No,
- That's it!

1373
01:18:12,630 --> 01:18:13,830
That's it!

1374
01:18:15,530 --> 01:18:17,060
That's it!

1375
01:18:20,260 --> 01:18:21,730
That's it!

1376
01:18:31,700 --> 01:18:33,360
I told you to come in slowly, didn't I?

1377
01:18:33,760 --> 01:18:35,300
I told you to come in slowly.

1378
01:18:35,560 --> 01:18:38,800
He's been like that since earlier.

1379
01:18:38,800 --> 01:18:41,000
Sorry, please, can we do that again.

1380
01:18:43,130 --> 01:18:44,760
It can't end like this.

1381
01:18:44,760 --> 01:18:46,360
You don't think it can end like this?

1382
01:18:46,760 --> 01:18:51,060
Then the next staff get together, has to be at least a course meal.

1383
01:18:51,060 --> 01:18:51,830
Oh, of course.

1384
01:18:51,830 --> 01:18:53,830
Go and come to an agreement with the boss.

1385
01:18:53,830 --> 01:18:55,260
Go convince him.

1386
01:19:01,160 --> 01:19:05,130
If the next get together is a course affair,

1387
01:19:07,400 --> 01:19:08,700
Are you trying to make a deal with me?

1388
01:19:11,060 --> 01:19:13,000
Well since Seo-jin will be the one paying.

1389
01:19:13,960 --> 01:19:16,330
If you buy a course meal, then we'll give you another chance.

1390
01:19:17,130 --> 01:19:17,800
Alright, alright.

1391
01:19:21,100 --> 01:19:23,500
- I'll go in a bit later. Sorry.
- This is your last chance.

1392
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:26,260
What's the order?

1393
01:19:26,360 --> 01:19:27,500
The same as before.

1394
01:19:28,100 --> 01:19:29,400
How did you come in this time?

1395
01:19:29,400 --> 01:19:31,260
But there was no space for me to go in.

1396
01:19:32,430 --> 01:19:33,730
When there's this much space?

1397
01:19:35,360 --> 01:19:37,760
You're saying there was no space?

1398
01:19:37,760 --> 01:19:39,160
No, there was plenty of space.

1399
01:19:39,830 --> 01:19:42,630
- Just do it,
- Alright, there might've been not enough space.

1400
01:19:45,530 --> 01:19:46,260
Let's do it.

1401
01:19:50,130 --> 01:19:51,160
Go forward.

1402
01:19:54,760 --> 01:19:56,930
Forward. I'll go forward.

1403
01:20:07,130 --> 01:20:08,060
Let's do it.

1404
01:20:11,930 --> 01:20:12,800
Go forward.

1405
01:20:16,330 --> 01:20:18,560
Forward. I'll go forward.

1406
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:36,700
That's it!

1407
01:20:36,700 --> 01:20:41,300
But the rope, the rope was so high and barely hitting the ground.

1408
01:20:43,660 --> 01:20:45,760
The turning of the rope.

1409
01:20:46,030 --> 01:20:47,300
I guess they got tired.

1410
01:20:48,460 --> 01:20:51,330
- They got tired, so,
- Let's stop.

1411
01:20:51,730 --> 01:20:54,330
Good work.

1412
01:20:57,900 --> 01:20:59,400
Then our get together,

1413
01:20:59,400 --> 01:21:01,430
It's all over. Good work.

1414
01:21:01,730 --> 01:21:02,630
We can stop filming.

1415
01:21:08,200 --> 01:21:09,330
Everyone, get over here.

1416
01:21:09,330 --> 01:21:12,900
I think it's over. Sorry, but you all look down. Are you okay?

1417
01:21:13,800 --> 01:21:15,460
I'm planning on ending .

1418
01:21:17,160 --> 01:21:19,100
We should stop, if a team building retreat looks like this.

1419
01:21:20,360 --> 01:21:23,000
What kind of team building retreat ends with us tearing each other apart.

1420
01:21:24,500 --> 01:21:27,000
Then we'll take a group photo and wrap things up.

1421
01:21:45,430 --> 01:21:47,200
We'll do one more with you holding this.

1422
01:21:50,630 --> 01:21:52,260
It feels even worse now we're holding this.

1423
01:21:57,060 --> 01:21:58,900
I'm sorry, can you at least smile?

1424
01:22:06,730 --> 01:22:08,160
Stop taking photos.

1425
01:22:12,400 --> 01:22:15,600
Thank you. Good work.

1426
01:22:15,600 --> 01:22:18,530
We'll stop filming now. Thank you for your work.

1427
01:22:20,500 --> 01:22:25,100
