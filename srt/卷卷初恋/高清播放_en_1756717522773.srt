1
00:00:20,603 --> 00:00:22,605
My first confession was at the age of five in my life

2
00:00:23,106 --> 00:00:26,276
Although the confession was successful, the location was a cemetery

3
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:28,361
My cousin is still my cousin

4
00:00:29,195 --> 00:00:30,321
(Li Kangzhen, I like you)

5
00:00:30,405 --> 00:00:32,991
The second confession was when I was in the third grade of elementary school

6
00:00:33,825 --> 00:00:35,160
"I like you"

7
00:00:35,785 --> 00:00:37,162
In the note sent back

8
00:00:37,245 --> 00:00:40,040
He left the five words "I like you too"

9
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:43,460
He transferred to school the next day

10
00:00:44,127 --> 00:00:45,045
well

11
00:00:45,128 --> 00:00:47,088
I'm going to transfer to school, why do I still accept my love?

12
00:00:49,507 --> 00:00:50,341
Since then

13
00:00:50,425 --> 00:00:51,593
Three two one!

14
00:00:51,676 --> 00:00:54,304
The curly hair gene is beginning to appear

15
00:00:57,098 --> 00:00:58,433
Three two one

16
00:01:00,643 --> 00:01:04,481
Different from the fraternal twin Huili
My hair started to roll

17
00:01:05,148 --> 00:01:07,650
Life is starting to be knotted

18
00:01:18,244 --> 00:01:20,163
Just as I was about to confess my love to my brother next door

19
00:01:20,872 --> 00:01:25,877
But he is holding
Huili's hands, whose hair was straight and smooth, left

20
00:01:28,213 --> 00:01:30,340
At that moment I swear

21
00:01:32,675 --> 00:01:34,886
Never confess my love again

22
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:42,352
Don't confess your love

23
00:01:46,856 --> 00:01:47,899
Don't confess your love

24
00:01:50,068 --> 00:01:52,612
"First Love"

25
00:02:08,545 --> 00:02:09,546
Hello!

26
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:11,131
What are you doing?

27
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:15,218
Hello, didn’t you agree that it was my turn this week?

28
00:02:15,301 --> 00:02:17,095
I want to listen to "Good Morning Pops"

29
00:02:20,932 --> 00:02:23,601
Error 500 (Server Error)!!1500.That’s an error.There was an error. Please try again later.That’s all we know.

30
00:02:23,685 --> 00:02:26,271
What's the big deal early in the morning

31
00:02:26,354 --> 00:02:29,023
She's so willful every time

32
00:02:29,691 --> 00:02:32,485
Didn’t she say that she should learn from this?

33
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:35,738
What about you, you know that you listen to popular songs every day

34
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:38,616
Then buy me a CD player

35
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:42,120
Or just sell me and buy it

36
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:44,289
Huili dad

37
00:02:44,372 --> 00:02:45,665
What are you looking at so focused?

38
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:48,084
Come and have a meal

39
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:49,752
Shili, look!

40
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:51,171
There is nothing that cannot be done!

41
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:52,297
Wow!

42
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:53,673
The world's number one

43
00:02:53,756 --> 00:02:55,133
But some things can't be done

44
00:02:55,216 --> 00:02:56,384
What can't be done?

45
00:02:56,467 --> 00:02:57,886
I'll ask you to have a meal

46
00:02:57,969 --> 00:02:58,970
You are Park Seri, too

47
00:02:59,053 --> 00:03:01,723
this! Can't solve it no matter how

48
00:03:02,223 --> 00:03:03,725
This curly hair hereditary to me by my dad

49
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:06,311
It's impossible to become straight if you die

50
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:08,313
Really

51
00:03:08,396 --> 00:03:10,732
Come on, just save money on perm

52
00:03:10,815 --> 00:03:11,774
dad!

53
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:13,234
This perm is more expensive

54
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:15,320
Do you know how expensive it is to perm straighten hair?

55
00:03:15,403 --> 00:03:16,696
Dad wants to pay me?

56
00:03:16,779 --> 00:03:19,073
Just stop eating, don’t eat it or not?

57
00:03:19,657 --> 00:03:20,658
I know

58
00:03:20,742 --> 00:03:21,743
Isseiri

59
00:03:21,826 --> 00:03:22,994
Come out quickly

60
00:03:23,077 --> 00:03:24,871
Why don't you come out quickly

61
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:32,295
Early in the morning, Huili is unpleasant

62
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:33,713
Are you sure?

63
00:03:33,796 --> 00:03:34,839
What's wrong?

64
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:40,678
I've won

65
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:42,096
-Give me
-Remember it

66
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:45,141
I heard that Park Hye-ri won the first place in their school again

67
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:47,060
It's nothing to do with her

68
00:03:47,143 --> 00:03:49,103
-What's this?
-Shili

69
00:03:49,187 --> 00:03:51,481
You and your sister are much different, too
Are you really sisters?

70
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:54,192
Hello, Zheng Duowan, you have crossed the line

71
00:03:54,275 --> 00:03:55,652
Yes, and

72
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:58,071
It's more cute than Huili

73
00:03:59,447 --> 00:04:00,490
Ma Luzhi

74
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:01,407
Um?

75
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:02,992
What are you doing wrong?

76
00:04:03,618 --> 00:04:06,496
Please Shili
Can you change your deskmate this time

77
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:08,122
What's wrong? Is it Bai Cheng here again?

78
00:04:08,206 --> 00:04:09,666
It doesn't matter what you do with Bai Cheng

79
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:11,542
I just don't want to be a deskmate with him
The ears are not going to stand it anymore

80
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:13,211
Hey!

81
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:14,963
Shi Yi Shi Li led Fang Wan!

82
00:04:15,463 --> 00:04:16,839
The weather is so good today!

83
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:17,840
Bai Cheng is here

84
00:04:18,341 --> 00:04:19,509
Let's go quickly

85
00:04:41,739 --> 00:04:42,615
Come

86
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:43,825
Why are there so many things?

87
00:04:43,908 --> 00:04:44,909
Hurry up

88
00:04:48,329 --> 00:04:49,163
Um?

89
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:50,790
It's Kim Hyun

90
00:04:51,874 --> 00:04:52,959
Isn’t that Kim Hyun?

91
00:04:53,042 --> 00:04:54,043
It's Kim Hyun

92
00:04:57,171 --> 00:04:58,006
Kim Hyun!

93
00:05:01,092 --> 00:05:01,926
Huh?

94
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:05,138
Kim Hyun

95
00:05:06,264 --> 00:05:08,766
A boy whom half of the students in the school have a crush on

96
00:05:11,894 --> 00:05:14,772
He actually greeted me?

97
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:23,364
What's going on?

98
00:05:24,032 --> 00:05:25,366
Why would he say hello to you?

99
00:05:26,617 --> 00:05:27,535
No, actually...

100
00:05:28,369 --> 00:05:29,454
Last night at the beach...

101
00:05:29,537 --> 00:05:31,247
What are you doing at the beach?

102
00:05:36,044 --> 00:05:38,755
Because the weather is good

103
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:40,298
While swimming by the sea...

104
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:56,272
(Kim Hyun)

105
00:06:13,414 --> 00:06:15,333
Why are you here?

106
00:06:17,668 --> 00:06:18,920
Are you from our school?

107
00:06:21,547 --> 00:06:23,383
I thought only I knew about it

108
00:06:25,593 --> 00:06:28,346
I thought I only knew about it here.

109
00:06:28,429 --> 00:06:31,265
You said he took off his clothes and put them next to you?

110
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:32,642
-yes
-Huh?

111
00:06:33,142 --> 00:06:34,894
Why did this?

112
00:06:34,977 --> 00:06:36,437
Is there anything special?

113
00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:37,688
A little bit slim

114
00:06:39,982 --> 00:06:42,860
Guys, let's get out of the way, we're not interested

115
00:06:42,944 --> 00:06:44,612
Let it go

116
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:47,990
(The second mock exam for the first semester of senior high school
Ranking list of results)

117
00:06:48,866 --> 00:06:50,076
What are you looking at?

118
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:51,077
It has nothing to do with you

119
00:06:53,162 --> 00:06:54,330
Kim Hyun

120
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:55,331
It's really Kim Hyun

121
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:56,249
(100 Kim Hyun)

122
00:06:56,332 --> 00:06:57,166
Park Se-ri

123
00:06:57,792 --> 00:06:58,835
Kim Hyun is going to study room

124
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:02,922
The study room is only one hundred in the school
A place to enter

125
00:07:03,005 --> 00:07:07,051
Legend has it that I can definitely become a couple

126
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:09,137
But now
I don't want to swim in the sea anymore

127
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:10,638
Once you soak in the sea, you will get hungry

128
00:07:10,721 --> 00:07:12,348
Go and eat fried rice cakes, your body is sticky

129
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:14,058
Go home and take a shower and go out again, it's troublesome

130
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:16,102
But I want to eat rice cakes too much

131
00:07:16,727 --> 00:07:18,646
Fried rice cakes should be eaten outside to taste

132
00:07:19,313 --> 00:07:20,273
Isseiri

133
00:07:20,356 --> 00:07:21,482
Have you been to the Qingshui snack bar?

134
00:07:21,566 --> 00:07:22,400
Bai Chenglai

135
00:07:23,818 --> 00:07:24,652
Have you been there?

136
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:27,989
I finally understand
Why can't I stand being with you

137
00:07:28,573 --> 00:07:29,449
Who said it?

138
00:07:29,991 --> 00:07:30,867
What Ma Luzhi said?

139
00:07:31,826 --> 00:07:33,286
Hello, Ma Luzhi!

140
00:07:34,412 --> 00:07:35,663
Have you been to the Qingshui snack bar?

141
00:07:36,414 --> 00:07:39,000
Oh, it's so noisy. Can you shut up?

142
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:40,251
Are you nothing to do?

143
00:07:40,334 --> 00:07:41,335
Have you finished copying?

144
00:07:43,045 --> 00:07:44,422
I'll copy it...

145
00:07:45,381 --> 00:07:46,340
Not finished yet

146
00:07:53,723 --> 00:07:54,557
All stand upright

147
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:55,975
Salute to the teacher

148
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:57,768
Hello teacher

149
00:07:59,103 --> 00:08:01,189
I want to announce one

150
00:08:02,356 --> 00:08:03,608
Suffering news

151
00:08:04,358 --> 00:08:08,279
The study tour that I didn't go to last year due to a typhoon

152
00:08:10,031 --> 00:08:11,282
I decided to let everyone go this year

153
00:08:15,536 --> 00:08:16,412
Quiet!

154
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:21,083
Where can I find schools in the world
Will you let your senior high school go on a study trip?

155
00:08:22,376 --> 00:08:24,003
It's all your school manager's problem

156
00:08:24,712 --> 00:08:25,630
so

157
00:08:25,713 --> 00:08:27,340
Starting today

158
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:30,426
Add two copies per week

159
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:33,262
-ah!
-teacher

160
00:08:34,388 --> 00:08:35,515
here!

161
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:37,975
here!

162
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:42,063
-nice shot!
-nice shot!

163
00:08:42,146 --> 00:08:42,980
good!

164
00:08:45,233 --> 00:08:46,067
Hey

165
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:46,984
-Hey!
-Um?

166
00:08:47,985 --> 00:08:49,237
Ah, it's totally...

167
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,571
Gen Ei!

168
00:08:50,655 --> 00:08:51,948
-Hey
- Pass the ball

169
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:53,449
I'll pass the ball again

170
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:57,036
-nice shot!
-good!

171
00:08:58,287 --> 00:08:59,205
It's time to move

172
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:02,375
Aunt

173
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:04,293
I want a NeverStop

174
00:09:17,598 --> 00:09:20,476
Help me give this drink to the tall ones in the basketball court...

175
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,602
You mean Kim Hyun?

176
00:09:21,686 --> 00:09:23,354
Huh? Yes, how do you know?

177
00:09:24,272 --> 00:09:25,356
today

178
00:09:25,439 --> 00:09:27,275
There are many "SRs"

179
00:09:27,358 --> 00:09:29,944
Xiulin, Xinglian, Shili

180
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:34,448
Just want to hook a man like this?

181
00:09:35,199 --> 00:09:37,118
All the drinks are over, will the bladder not be able to bear it

182
00:09:37,201 --> 00:09:38,703
(Kim Hyun, brother Kim Hyun, ♡-Ji Hye-)

183
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:41,455
I want one too

184
00:09:42,164 --> 00:09:42,999
So hot

185
00:09:50,965 --> 00:09:52,258
Park Se-ri

186
00:09:52,341 --> 00:09:53,509
Takanishi

187

Speaking of Gao Renshi, her real name is Gao Renjing

188
00:09:57,847 --> 00:09:58,973
I've done a good job of combing my hair today

189
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:02,643
Because the hairstyle looks too much like the stone tomb
So I got this nickname

190
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:04,770
Yes, I have a good comb today

191
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:09,984
We used to hold the pad cleat hair together

195

"Park Se-ri"

196
00:10:53,402 --> 00:10:54,362
The name sounds really good

197
00:10:56,906 --> 00:10:57,740
Very suitable for you

Um?

201
00:12:16,819 --> 00:12:17,653
Hello?

202
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:21,490
Help

203
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:26,162
Hello Can you hear it?

204
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:28,080
Oh my God I'm going crazy!

205
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:47,308
How are you?

206
00:12:47,391 --> 00:12:49,310
Are you a little more awake?

207
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:55,441
Really scared

208
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:58,819
You can't even swim. Where can you get the courage?

209
00:13:01,739 --> 00:13:03,032
Really

210
00:13:05,868 --> 00:13:06,702
Huh?

211
00:13:08,996 --> 00:13:11,540
Don't go into the sea casually. It's very dangerous!

214
00:13:28,724 --> 00:13:29,975
So there is such a thing

215
00:13:30,851 --> 00:13:31,894
But

216
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:34,480
You can't bother others if you don't take the college entrance examination

217
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,440
Even though you're one year older than them

218
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:38,818
But get along well like a friend

219
00:13:39,401 --> 00:13:41,987
Big news! The newborn is here!

220
00:13:43,405 --> 00:13:44,573
Big news!

221
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:46,408
Why do you keep getting big news?

222
00:13:46,992 --> 00:13:48,911
You know I was in the academic room just now
Have you seen something?

223
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:49,954
What?

224
00:13:58,254 --> 00:14:02,132
Today there is a new classmate who transferred from Seoul

225
00:14:02,216 --> 00:14:03,717
-Seoul?
-Introduce it by myself

226

it's over

229
00:14:15,437 --> 00:14:16,480
Look at his broken legs

230
00:14:16,564 --> 00:14:18,315
-Han Yunxi
- It was obvious that he had caused trouble.

231

You go to the seat in the back row

232
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:21,277
I heard he stayed one level

233
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,529
ah? Leave a level?

234
00:14:23,612 --> 00:14:25,322

236
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:31,620
Don't cause trouble

-good

Fortunately, I met me yesterday

247
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:18,208
You've almost gotten into trouble

Hello What's the situation?

251
00:15:31,305 --> 00:15:32,139
Do you two know each other?

252
00:15:32,222 --> 00:15:34,642

253
00:15:34,725 --> 00:15:35,935
ah? seaside?

254
00:15:36,685 --> 00:15:39,355
-When doing what?
-The mouth will be sore when explained

255
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:41,440
Do you want to see Kim Hyun?

256
00:15:44,234 --> 00:15:46,153

-I've got it right
-No

259
00:15:49,865 --> 00:15:50,699
Has it been agreed

260
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,076
Really not

261
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:53,452
-What a good idea
- Say it now

262
00:15:53,535 --> 00:15:54,411
yes

263
00:16:15,891 --> 00:16:16,850
Huh? Hello!

264
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:18,560
Isn’t that Bai Cheng coming?

265
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:20,980
What is he doing?

266
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:27,569
Bai Chenglai, what are you doing?

267
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:29,321
Walk slowly

268
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:30,572
Look at Brother Yunxi

269
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:33,951
Holding an umbrella, carrying a schoolbag, and leaning on a cane
It feels so sad when you look

270
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:36,578
Or you can help

271
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:39,373
I'm afraid he thinks I'm too meddling

272
00:16:39,957 --> 00:16:41,041
Bai Chenglai

273
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:43,335
You are the troublesome person. What are you saying

274
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:44,253
Really

275
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:48,215
oops

276
00:16:49,883 --> 00:16:51,427

-How could it be fine?

279
00:16:58,142 --> 00:16:59,435
Go quickly I'll be late

281
00:17:03,063 --> 00:17:05,274
Look, Shili helps him in the end

282
00:17:09,611 --> 00:17:10,738
You guys come here

283
00:17:11,488 --> 00:17:12,448
Bai Cheng comes, come here for me

284
00:17:14,241 --> 00:17:17,995
Your friend's leg is injured and still in the rain

285
00:17:18,078 --> 00:17:20,831
You're so cool

286
00:17:20,914 --> 00:17:22,124
No, that...

287
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:24,001
What are you doing if you don’t help with the bag?

288
00:17:31,925 --> 00:17:34,428
Park Se-ri, don’t you have anything to say?

289
00:17:35,929 --> 00:17:37,139
Um? Am I?

290
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:41,268
My head is like this because it rains

291
00:17:41,351 --> 00:17:42,853
The teacher also knows that I don't have a perm

292
00:17:42,936 --> 00:17:43,896
Not hair

293
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:45,439
famous brand

294
00:17:46,815 --> 00:17:48,817
Huh? Where did the famous brands go?

295
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:51,487
It was obviously worn before going out, but it disappeared

296
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:53,447
I won't wear famous brands tomorrow

297
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:55,866
Just take you to the beauty salon and burn it.

298
00:17:55,949 --> 00:17:56,784

Don't push it!

302
00:18:22,184 --> 00:18:23,519
Hey

303
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:24,436
You see

304
00:18:24,978 --> 00:18:25,854
Ouch

305
00:18:26,814 --> 00:18:28,232
He can't even eat like that

306
00:18:28,315 --> 00:18:29,650
Why

307
00:18:29,733 --> 00:18:31,360
Why do you always see him

308
00:18:40,327 --> 00:18:41,203
elder brother

309
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:42,454
Please use it slowly

310
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:45,332
Hello, what else do you say about the classmate, "Please use it slowly"

311
00:18:45,415 --> 00:18:47,209
No matter how you say it is bigger than us

312
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:49,753
Don't be so conservative

313
00:18:49,837 --> 00:18:52,089
Yes, this guy also said it's good

315
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:55,425
You're just "this person" is strange

316
00:18:55,509 --> 00:18:58,137
Yes, just call him brother
"This one" is so weird

317
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:01,056
I'm born to be unable to say the word "brother"

318
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,100
I've never called anyone brother in my life

319
00:19:03,183 --> 00:19:05,644
It feels so uncomfortable when you open your mouth

320
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:09,314
Don't be so conservative

321
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:12,442
OK Han Yunxi, let's get along well

322
00:19:12,526 --> 00:19:13,360
Eat more

323
00:19:14,945 --> 00:19:15,779
Or that's it?

324
00:19:17,072 --> 00:19:18,574
Don't you want that? Big brother

325
00:19:19,533 --> 00:19:20,826
But brother

326
00:19:20,909 --> 00:19:23,453
I heard you were saved by Park Se-ri at the beach?

327
00:19:23,537 --> 00:19:24,454
Um?

328
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:26,039
Shi Yi Shili is the eldest brother's life-saving benefactor

329
00:19:26,123 --> 00:19:27,082

I am your savior, right?

332

Keep an umbrella for you today

333
00:19:31,962 --> 00:19:33,463
I'll serve you rice, right?

334
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:37,926
ice cream

335
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:41,263
ice cream!

336
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:43,015
-Thank you for the hospitality
-Um

337
00:19:43,891 --> 00:19:45,642
It's not because you invited me to say that

338
00:19:45,726 --> 00:19:46,935
I think my brother is pretty handsome

339
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:50,314
You've just met Brother Yunxi a few times
Just say such things?

340
00:19:51,148 --> 00:19:52,774
I heard that I even gave up the college entrance examination?

341
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:54,401
How did you know?

342
00:19:54,484 --> 00:19:55,444
Our class teacher...

343
00:19:56,945 --> 00:19:58,697
Anyway, I admire my brother very much

344
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:00,949
Give up, it's really hard

345
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:01,909
Look at me

346
00:20:01,992 --> 00:20:03,118
- Can't abandon it
-What's wrong?

347
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:04,203
Don't move

348
00:20:04,286 --> 00:20:06,413
Hey, it looks pretty decent

349
00:20:06,496 --> 00:20:08,874
But where did your brand go?

350
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:11,668
-I don't know either
-Is someone taking it?

351
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:16,465
I heard that just hold the famous brand of someone you like

352
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:18,467
People who like it will also like themselves

353
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:20,135
It seems that someone likes you

354
00:20:20,802 --> 00:20:21,678
yes

355
00:20:21,762 --> 00:20:23,347
Someone stole it on purpose

356
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:30,562
Park Se-ri Your brand was stolen

357
00:20:32,189 --> 00:20:33,649
Has anyone really taken it?

358
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:35,275
A little difficult to deal with

359
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:36,860
I like Kim Hyun

360
00:20:36,944 --> 00:20:38,820
If someone holds a famous brand and says he likes me

361
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:40,489
What to do...

362
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,039
Sorry, are you okay?

363
00:20:51,792 --> 00:20:52,626
ah?

364
00:20:53,126 --> 00:20:54,002
Um

365
00:20:54,544 --> 00:20:57,005
Yes, it's okay

366
00:20:57,673 --> 00:20:59,424
-I'm really sorry
-What are you doing?

367
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:01,593
-Don't you come?
-I'll come right away

368
00:21:02,719 --> 00:21:03,553
Is it really okay?

369
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:05,097
See you next time

370
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:07,307

00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:15,107
I feel like Kim Hyun did it on purpose

374
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:17,067
Did you just see him laughing? That look is amazing

375
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:19,778
real? Did Kim Hyun look at me just now?

376
00:21:19,861 --> 00:21:20,904
It's really amazing

377
00:21:20,988 --> 00:21:22,364
That's already flirting

378
00:21:23,031 --> 00:21:25,575
Maybe Kim Hyun kicked the ball to you on purpose

379
00:21:25,659 --> 00:21:27,786
Right?

380

I don't feel like I was kicking you on purpose

384
00:21:41,425 --> 00:21:42,551
Yeah?

385
00:21:42,634 --> 00:21:44,678
A moment of things are very careful

386
00:21:46,013 --> 00:21:47,347
No matter how you look at it, you're careless...

387

-hiss
-Why

388
00:21:49,099 --> 00:21:50,475
Shili Forget it

389
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:51,852
Don't take it to heart. It's okay

390

Why is the elder brother so eyebrowless?

393
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:12,122
I heard that Kim Hyun likes Lee Hyo-ri

394
00:22:12,706 --> 00:22:14,124
-Really?
-yes

395
00:22:14,207 --> 00:22:16,001

Forget it, I'm not in that mood now

How do you...

410
00:23:11,014 --> 00:23:14,267
I've straightened my hair

411
00:23:14,351 --> 00:23:16,144
I don't believe it

412
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:17,896
Have you ever been successful in hot?

413
00:23:17,979 --> 00:23:19,648

414
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,358
It's magic

But the next day, it will return to its original state after washing the hair the next day

What's the difference?

432
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:17,330
It can be said to be completely different

Different medications, different machines

434
00:24:19,749 --> 00:24:22,919
Just like you're straight hair when you're born

00:30:45,134 --> 00:30:45,969
Leaving?

562
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:52,934
Why

563
00:30:53,935 --> 00:30:55,770
Something big almost happened

564
00:30:55,854 --> 00:30:57,939
Can't let him see me like this

565
00:30:58,982 --> 00:31:01,192
appearance? As usual

566
00:31:02,610 --> 00:31:03,820
Han Yunxi

567
00:31:04,654 --> 00:31:05,488
Something is going to happen

568
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:07,740
-Why
-What's wrong?

569
00:31:08,324 --> 00:31:09,576
Come with me

570
00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:10,493
Where to go?

571
00:31:10,577 --> 00:31:12,036
Don't talk nonsense, come quickly

572
00:31:18,459 --> 00:31:19,544
Be careful

573
00:31:38,187 --> 00:31:39,063
Going crazy

574
00:31:39,856 --> 00:31:41,733
Are you okay?

575
00:31:41,816 --> 00:31:43,860
What to do if the bandage is completely wet?

576
00:31:46,279 --> 00:31:47,614
Where is this place?

577
00:31:48,448 --> 00:31:49,908
This is my dad's warehouse

578
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:51,451
By the way

579
00:31:57,123 --> 00:31:57,957
for you

580
00:32:04,672 --> 00:32:06,674
You wear it there, I won't see it

581
00:32:08,051 --> 00:32:09,177
Is this your clothes?

582
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:12,513
Not my dad's, everything here is his

583
00:32:20,396 --> 00:32:21,314
Can I come out?

584
00:32:24,108 --> 00:32:24,943
Um

585
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:33,910
These are also your dad's?

586
00:32:34,661 --> 00:32:35,578
Um

587
00:32:35,662 --> 00:32:38,790
Apart from this one, this is my space

588
00:32:40,375 --> 00:32:42,085
Do you like reading comics?

589
00:32:42,168 --> 00:32:43,044
No

590
00:32:44,462 --> 00:32:45,672
Not that meaning

591
00:32:46,297 --> 00:32:47,715
Actually, I haven't read the comics

592
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:50,009
ah? you…

593
00:32:50,093 --> 00:32:51,844
Have you never read a comic?

594
00:32:52,679 --> 00:32:53,805
Um

595
00:32:53,888 --> 00:32:54,847
Oh my God

596
00:32:58,267 --> 00:32:59,102
come over

597
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:02,021
I don't show it to others casually

598
00:33:02,772 --> 00:33:03,606
Come and sit down

599
00:33:04,273 --> 00:33:06,317
These are my dad's. I can't lend them to you

600
00:33:06,401 --> 00:33:07,777
But you can check it out occasionally

601
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:08,987
Make a favor for you

602
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:10,697
No, no

603
00:33:11,864 --> 00:33:12,907
Han Yunxi

604
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:17,787
If you don't read these books, you will lose your life

605
00:33:21,207 --> 00:33:22,417
Yes, there is

606
00:33:30,091 --> 00:33:30,925
Take it

607
00:33:39,225 --> 00:33:40,518
Really

608
00:33:40,601 --> 00:33:42,020
You really can't do it

609
00:33:42,103 --> 00:33:43,771
You can come here to see it in the future

610
00:33:44,313 --> 00:33:45,690
The password here is

611
00:33:46,357 --> 00:33:47,316
It's 486

612
00:33:47,817 --> 00:33:48,651
ah?

613
00:33:49,235 --> 00:33:50,069
486？

614
00:33:50,153 --> 00:33:52,989
Speak quietly! Will hear it

615
00:33:53,823 --> 00:33:55,742
who? Is anyone here?

616
00:33:55,825 --> 00:33:59,954
No I mean 486 is the password

617
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:00,913
4862？

618
00:34:00,997 --> 00:34:02,081
no!

619
00:34:02,165 --> 00:34:04,292
Not 4862!

620
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:05,793
Going crazy

621
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:08,046
No, I'll write it for you

622
00:34:08,129 --> 00:34:10,465
No need I can't remember 486...

623
00:34:10,548 --> 00:34:11,758
All said to be quiet!

624
00:34:12,925 --> 00:34:15,386
You must keep it confidential

625
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:17,346
Only my dad and I will come here

626
00:34:18,139 --> 00:34:19,348
Especially Bai Chenglai

627
00:34:19,974 --> 00:34:21,809
It would be bad if he knew

628
00:34:22,351 --> 00:34:26,147
Because his ears still hurt, it's true

629
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:41,579
(Kim Hyun confesses his love to the big battle)

630
00:34:41,662 --> 00:34:45,083
First of all, at this most important moment in my life

631
00:34:45,166 --> 00:34:47,668
I'm really grateful that you can be with me

632
00:34:47,752 --> 00:34:48,586
Hey

633
00:34:48,669 --> 00:34:50,338
You're not talking nonsense

634
00:34:50,421 --> 00:34:51,672
-Um
-We are friends

635
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:53,633
OK！

636
00:34:54,675 --> 00:34:55,510
Give!

637
00:34:57,386 --> 00:34:58,304
Um

638
00:34:59,597 --> 00:35:01,349
-Is that the discount?
-Um

639
00:35:02,725 --> 00:35:03,893
What is this doing?

640
00:35:03,976 --> 00:35:04,811
What to do?

641
00:35:05,812 --> 00:35:07,480
Shi Yi Shi Li wants to confess to Kim Hyun

642
00:35:08,314 --> 00:35:09,607
Brother, can you fold a thousand paper cranes?

643
00:35:10,525 --> 00:35:11,359
Thousand paper cranes?

644
00:35:13,444 --> 00:35:14,403
A crane with thousands of papers?

645
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:16,322
Paper crane

646
00:35:18,449 --> 00:35:21,244
Bring one by one to one by one, put your heart in

647
00:35:21,327 --> 00:35:22,578
Is a thousand enough?

648
00:35:22,662 --> 00:35:25,373
Meizhen from the next class has sold 1,000 pieces

649
00:35:25,456 --> 00:35:27,208
Then we'll have ten thousand

650
00:35:27,792 --> 00:35:29,710
-ah?
-Ten thousand?

651
00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:30,878
How to discount 10,000 yuan?

652
00:35:30,962 --> 00:35:32,421
- Too many
- Ten thousand is good

653
00:35:32,505 --> 00:35:33,339
How could it be good?

654
00:35:33,422 --> 00:35:34,257
Ten thousand is a must

655
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:35,174
-no
-bring it on

656
00:35:35,258 --> 00:35:36,384
Han Yunxi

657
00:35:37,218 --> 00:35:38,177
Where are you going?

658
00:35:39,303 --> 00:35:42,723
Don’t know how important you are in this plan?

659
00:35:42,807 --> 00:35:43,683
Am I?

660
00:35:44,851 --> 00:35:45,685
Um

661
00:35:47,395 --> 00:35:49,230
"Seoul Magical Straight Hair

662
00:35:49,313 --> 00:35:50,523
Han Yunxiu”

663
00:35:51,107 --> 00:35:51,941
ah

664
00:35:52,775 --> 00:35:55,444
But I don't know much about origami...

665
00:35:55,528 --> 00:35:57,321
-Brother, we are friends
-yes

666
00:35:58,531 --> 00:36:00,575
Forget it, people from Seoul don't understand our culture

667
00:36:00,658 --> 00:36:03,035
Forget it, let him go

668
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:05,538
It seems that he needs to deal with important things

669
00:36:06,581 --> 00:36:08,833
Just treat your life-savior like this?

670
00:36:09,584 --> 00:36:10,543
-oops
-My Mom

671
00:36:10,626 --> 00:36:11,878
- Forget it
-It's fine

672
00:36:11,961 --> 00:36:12,920
Come

673
00:36:14,088 --> 00:36:15,089
Put this part like this

674
00:36:15,173 --> 00:36:16,757
Fold into a triangle

675
00:36:17,675 --> 00:36:19,010
Is this triangle foldable good

676
00:36:23,764 --> 00:36:25,349
Read out "Until"

677
00:36:25,433 --> 00:36:26,601
“Until”

678
00:36:26,684 --> 00:36:29,645
"I don't know what I want before I meet you"

679
00:36:29,729 --> 00:36:32,023
"I didn't know I wanted to..."

680
00:36:38,529 --> 00:36:39,906
Wow, I've broken a lot

681
00:36:53,252 --> 00:36:54,170
Yo!

682
00:36:58,382 --> 00:36:59,217
Well?

683
00:36:59,967 --> 00:37:02,428
Am I walking too fast? Feel sorry

684
00:37:04,513 --> 00:37:05,556
fine

685
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:06,724
Scissors stone cloth!

686
00:37:08,434 --> 00:37:09,852
Scissors stone cloth!

687
00:37:14,649 --> 00:37:16,609
You will copy three copies next week

688
00:37:17,193 --> 00:37:19,570
Oops, teacher

689
00:37:20,196 --> 00:37:21,030
Four books?

690
00:37:25,493 --> 00:37:26,577
Han Yunxi

691
00:37:28,955 --> 00:37:31,249
What about your punishment?

692
00:37:31,832 --> 00:37:32,667
that

693
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:33,793
My leg was injured...

694
00:37:33,876 --> 00:37:36,545
Did you hurt your head?

695
00:37:37,755 --> 00:37:39,674
Are you writing with your legs?

696
00:37:41,133 --> 00:37:41,968
"Bai Chenglai"

697
00:37:42,051 --> 00:37:43,302
-Wow
-Brother

698
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:46,264
The teacher said he could only do it with his teeth

699
00:37:46,973 --> 00:37:49,225
Why not?

700
00:37:49,308 --> 00:37:52,019
If I lose the national ranking, can you be responsible?

701
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:53,896
Oh, it's just one day

702
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:56,899
You know that one day is the first in the school
How important is it?

703
00:37:59,193 --> 00:38:00,069
Really

704
00:38:00,152 --> 00:38:01,821
Huang Shangzhe

705
00:38:01,904 --> 00:38:03,531
Let me change it for a day

706
00:38:03,614 --> 00:38:05,825
This is very important to me!

707
00:38:05,908 --> 00:38:08,953
If not, it won’t work!

708
00:38:09,036 --> 00:38:11,831
I didn't want to say this at first.

709
00:38:12,623 --> 00:38:14,125
Is it meaningful for you to go there to confess?

710
00:38:14,792 --> 00:38:16,419
Will Kim Hyun fall in love with you?

711
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:19,255
Be awake

712
00:38:19,338 --> 00:38:22,133
See what level you are

713
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:27,138
A guy who looks like a half-washed blackboard
What are you saying!

714
00:38:27,221 --> 00:38:28,681
Are you crazy?

715
00:38:28,764 --> 00:38:31,309
Shi Yi Shili wants to confess her love in the study room

716
00:38:31,392 --> 00:38:32,935
Does someone need to change the position

717
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:35,354
He'll be done if he doesn't cooperate

718
00:38:35,438 --> 00:38:36,564
Nothing but learning...

719
00:38:36,647 --> 00:38:37,606
fine

720
00:38:40,735 --> 00:38:42,695
Pack me, I'll get mine

721
00:38:52,872 --> 00:38:54,665
I can get my own bag

722
00:38:58,210 --> 00:38:59,045
Thanks

723
00:38:59,545 --> 00:39:00,796
Wait a moment

724
00:39:09,347 --> 00:39:10,181
Return it to you

725
00:39:16,395 --> 00:39:17,229
Park Se-ri

726
00:39:19,607 --> 00:39:20,441
Are you crying?

727
00:39:24,362 --> 00:39:25,613
No

728
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:29,033
Who is Huang Shangzhe?

729
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:32,453
No, that's...

730
00:39:37,541 --> 00:39:38,501
No…

731
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:44,965
What to do with this?

732
00:39:46,133 --> 00:39:46,967
never mind

733
00:39:50,054 --> 00:39:53,057
(June 1999 mock exam)

734
00:40:10,825 --> 00:40:11,742
Han Yunxi

735
00:40:13,536 --> 00:40:14,870
Do you want to take the mock exam?

736
00:40:15,621 --> 00:40:16,455
Yes

737
00:40:16,956 --> 00:40:17,790
All right

738
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:32,263
Finished?

739
00:40:33,556 --> 00:40:34,390
Yes

740
00:41:02,835 --> 00:41:04,587
Didn’t you say you don’t read comics?

741
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:08,048
You let me see it

742
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:27,651
What are you doing?

743
00:41:27,735 --> 00:41:28,652
What to do?

744
00:41:29,278 --> 00:41:31,489
Pray with a pious heart

745
00:41:32,406 --> 00:41:33,657
Didn’t the answer be written?

746
00:41:35,367 --> 00:41:36,827
Shut up

747
00:41:36,911 --> 00:41:38,204
I'm very serious now

748
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:52,551
Really

749
00:41:53,052 --> 00:41:55,513
I really don't know what to be when I grow up

750
00:41:55,596 --> 00:41:57,056
Nothing special

751
00:41:57,139 --> 00:41:58,682
Nothing liked, either

752
00:41:59,642 --> 00:42:00,476
Why didn't there be any?

753
00:42:02,978 --> 00:42:04,230
Isn't you good at it?

754
00:42:05,689 --> 00:42:06,524
What is it?

755
00:42:07,274 --> 00:42:08,108
swim

756
00:42:09,693 --> 00:42:10,569
All right

757
00:42:11,237 --> 00:42:12,655
Thanks to swimming, I met Kim Hyun

758
00:42:15,115 --> 00:42:16,283
Why

759
00:42:16,367 --> 00:42:18,452
Wait until I'll straighten my hair

760
00:42:18,536 --> 00:42:20,621
I'll confess my love to Kim Hyun directly

761
00:42:22,081 --> 00:42:24,208
Do you have to straighten your hair to confess your love?

762
00:42:24,291 --> 00:42:25,918
Of course

763
00:42:26,001 --> 00:42:27,920
Who would like this hair?

764
00:42:28,504 --> 00:42:29,338
Why

765
00:42:39,848 --> 00:42:40,683
Huh?

766
00:42:43,477 --> 00:42:44,687
Hello

767
00:42:44,770 --> 00:42:45,604
ah?

768
00:42:45,688 --> 00:42:46,564
Why is it full?

769
00:42:47,064 --> 00:42:49,149
Did you fill it up?

770
00:42:52,861 --> 00:42:55,614
So touched

771
00:42:56,115 --> 00:43:00,119
I don't really understand how important these paper cranes are

772
00:43:00,202 --> 00:43:03,664
Of course it's very important

773
00:43:03,747 --> 00:43:05,958
But isn't it useless in the end?

774
00:43:07,459 --> 00:43:08,377
Han Yunxi

775
00:43:09,086 --> 00:43:10,671
That's why you can't

776
00:43:10,754 --> 00:43:12,965
Does it mean to be useful?

777
00:43:13,549 --> 00:43:14,800
There is

778
00:43:14,883 --> 00:43:18,679
Isn’t my heart, your heart, and friends’ hearts?

779
00:43:19,763 --> 00:43:22,099
Even if Kim Hyun won't accept my confession

780
00:43:22,182 --> 00:43:25,436
Time for us to work hard together
It will stay in this bottle too

781
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:28,981
Of course, Kim Hyun can't refuse me

782
00:43:33,944 --> 00:43:37,489
Then I'll give you a gift, too

783
00:43:40,284 --> 00:43:42,494
Beautiful? You can write a copy of the book

784
00:43:44,038 --> 00:43:46,040
But the head teacher really has a problem

785
00:43:46,123 --> 00:43:47,791
Even you have to copy it?

786
00:43:49,501 --> 00:43:50,336
yes

787
00:43:51,378 --> 00:43:52,921
Come here to do all kinds of strange things

788
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:59,637
Huh? Han Yunxi

789
00:44:00,763 --> 00:44:02,222
you!

790
00:44:03,015 --> 00:44:05,100
Finally removed the bandage!

791
00:44:05,601 --> 00:44:06,477
-Um
-Wow!

792
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:08,312
Congratulations, Han Yunxi!

793
00:44:09,063 --> 00:44:10,439
No, congratulations, brother!

794
00:44:11,065 --> 00:44:11,899
Yes, Shili

795
00:44:11,982 --> 00:44:13,692
Hello

796
00:44:13,776 --> 00:44:15,319
Thank you for your hard work, too

797
00:44:15,861 --> 00:44:17,696
Do you want to do Seoul magic straight hair?

798
00:44:18,197 --> 00:44:20,115
Auntie makes it for you for free

799
00:44:20,199 --> 00:44:21,033
ah?

800
00:44:21,575 --> 00:44:22,701
Really?

801
00:44:22,785 --> 00:44:24,828
Is it really free for me?

802
00:44:27,623 --> 00:44:28,749
Thank you so much!

803
00:44:28,832 --> 00:44:29,708
Do it today?

804
00:44:29,792 --> 00:44:31,001
that

805
00:44:31,085 --> 00:44:34,380
I won't do it today. I'll do it when I'm ready

806
00:44:35,297 --> 00:44:36,131
Prepare?

807
00:44:37,174 --> 00:44:38,258
It's insider

808
00:44:45,766 --> 00:44:47,434
What's wrong?

809
00:44:48,185 --> 00:44:50,020
Shili, look at that

810
00:44:50,604 --> 00:44:51,522
What?

811
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:53,774
ah?

812
00:44:53,857 --> 00:44:54,900
Han Yunxiu?

813
00:44:55,984 --> 00:44:56,819
Hello!

814
00:44:57,403 --> 00:44:58,654
Han Yunxi

815
00:44:58,737 --> 00:45:00,572
What's going on with you?

816
00:45:01,281 --> 00:45:03,450
Didn’t you say you needed a study room location?

817
00:45:03,534 --> 00:45:04,368
ah?

818
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:06,245
ah?

819
00:45:06,328 --> 00:45:08,956
Wow!

820
00:45:09,039 --> 00:45:10,332
Really amazing

821
00:45:10,416 --> 00:45:13,711
You're too handsome

822
00:45:15,921 --> 00:45:16,755
What's wrong?

823
00:45:16,839 --> 00:45:19,216
Are you unhappy? What's wrong?

824
00:45:19,925 --> 00:45:21,343
No, actually

825
00:45:21,427 --> 00:45:24,012
Kim Hyun fell out of the list

826
00:45:26,682 --> 00:45:27,766
Can't find it no matter how you look

827
00:45:29,852 --> 00:45:30,686
ah?

828
00:45:35,441 --> 00:45:36,358
(100 Sun He Education)

829
00:45:36,442 --> 00:45:37,276
ah?

830
00:45:46,952 --> 00:45:49,246
Brother wants to help you

831
00:46:05,137 --> 00:46:06,889
-Fuxi
- Come on

832
00:46:06,972 --> 00:46:07,890
Very busy?

833
00:46:07,973 --> 00:46:08,932
not busy

834
00:46:09,016 --> 00:46:10,100
Come and eat this

835
00:46:10,184 --> 00:46:13,479
I'm not doing anything for you. I'm welcome

836
00:46:13,562 --> 00:46:15,939
Have you heard of that rose hair salon?

837
00:46:16,023 --> 00:46:16,857
Oh, Rose Hairdressing House?

838
00:46:16,940 --> 00:46:19,651
The children of that family
This time I got the first place in the school. It's amazing

839
00:46:19,735 --> 00:46:23,530
I've heard of it, too
But why not take the college entrance examination?

840
00:46:24,907 --> 00:46:26,950
This world is unfair

841
00:46:27,034 --> 00:46:27,868
That's it

842
00:46:28,535 --> 00:46:30,245
I think I heard about her husband

843
00:46:30,329 --> 00:46:32,623
Be a professor at Seoul Seoul Seoul University Hospital

844
00:46:32,706 --> 00:46:34,583
Their background is incredible

845
00:46:35,083 --> 00:46:36,418
-Really?
-yes

846
00:46:36,502 --> 00:46:38,879
But why are there only mother and son
Come here to suffer?

847
00:46:38,962 --> 00:46:41,048
It seems that the husband is making people unable to breathe

848
00:46:41,548 --> 00:46:45,135
Have suspicious wife symptoms
I always say that my son is not good enough and I look for trouble every day

849
00:46:45,219 --> 00:46:46,678
What's wrong?

850
00:46:46,762 --> 00:46:47,596
That's it

851
00:46:48,222 --> 00:46:51,475
The child is so mentally injured that he can't even go to school

852
00:46:51,558 --> 00:46:53,018
Being slapped every day

853
00:46:53,101 --> 00:46:55,312
So this time I didn't even take the college entrance examination

854
00:46:55,395 --> 00:46:57,189
Oh my god what should I do

855
00:46:57,773 --> 00:47:00,275
I heard that Qiangwei's sister lives in the United States

856
00:47:00,359 --> 00:47:01,819
Always let them move over

857
00:47:12,663 --> 00:47:13,497
Is Yunxi here?

858
00:47:14,915 --> 00:47:15,874
Shili is here?

859
00:47:15,958 --> 00:47:17,501
ah? dad

860
00:47:18,502 --> 00:47:19,545
What's wrong?

861
00:47:19,628 --> 00:47:20,462
ah?

862
00:47:21,171 --> 00:47:22,256
Han Yunxi

863
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:24,883
Why are you there too?

864
00:47:24,967 --> 00:47:26,260
ah

865
00:47:26,343 --> 00:47:27,594
I asked him to eat noodles

866
00:47:28,512 --> 00:47:29,388
Hand-Pulled Noodle?

867
00:47:34,226 --> 00:47:35,352
Wait a moment…

868
00:47:38,313 --> 00:47:39,147
that

869
00:47:39,773 --> 00:47:40,607
Just now

870
00:47:41,441 --> 00:47:43,610
Sorry

871
00:47:43,694 --> 00:47:44,528
fine

872
00:47:45,737 --> 00:47:48,699
But I didn't expect you to be very smart

873
00:47:49,908 --> 00:47:50,951
Didn't expect it?

874
00:47:52,411 --> 00:47:53,912
Yunxi, do you like taking pictures?

875
00:47:54,788 --> 00:47:55,622
What?

876
00:47:55,706 --> 00:47:57,875
This is a disposable camera

877
00:47:57,958 --> 00:47:59,835
If you need it, use it at any time

878
00:47:59,918 --> 00:48:01,753
There are still a lot of them over there

879
00:48:01,837 --> 00:48:04,006
My dad runs a photo studio

880
00:48:05,215 --> 00:48:06,967
Shili, how did you do the exam visit?

881
00:48:07,050 --> 00:48:09,011
Dad, how can you say "visit"

882
00:48:09,094 --> 00:48:11,138
I was depressed because of the exam

883
00:48:11,763 --> 00:48:14,266
Why are you depressed? You're not doing well in the exam at all

884
00:48:14,349 --> 00:48:15,851
dad! Really

885
00:48:16,351 --> 00:48:17,853
Didn’t my dad expect anything?

886
00:48:17,936 --> 00:48:19,563
Why do I have no expectations of you?

887
00:48:20,314 --> 00:48:21,607
I just didn't expect you to have good grades

888
00:48:21,690 --> 00:48:23,400
Isn’t that just because I don’t expect it!

889
00:48:23,483 --> 00:48:25,652
Didn't my dad look forward to Huili?

890
00:48:25,736 --> 00:48:26,862
What does she have?

891
00:48:26,945 --> 00:48:29,072
Have you poured a glass of water?

892
00:48:29,156 --> 00:48:30,240
- Not reversed
-I'll just say

893
00:48:30,324 --> 00:48:32,117
-yes
-yes

894
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:33,744
Shili pours water for her father the best!

895
00:48:33,827 --> 00:48:35,662
-Right?
-yes!

896
00:48:43,837 --> 00:48:45,297
Stop doing it Park Se-ri

897
00:48:45,797 --> 00:48:47,174
You'll be bald before you get it hot

898
00:48:47,799 --> 00:48:50,677
I'm going to see Kim Hyun soon. Don't bother me

899
00:48:50,761 --> 00:48:51,887
Hey

900
00:48:51,970 --> 00:48:52,971
How do you confess?

901
00:48:54,514 --> 00:48:56,308
Yes, what should I do?

902
00:48:59,227 --> 00:49:01,521
Hello, stop talking, it will drive her crazy

903
00:49:02,064 --> 00:49:03,482
Alas, no

904
00:49:03,565 --> 00:49:06,276
I've been preparing for so long, don't you feel a pity?

905
00:49:08,695 --> 00:49:09,947
Studying and studying travel

906
00:49:10,030 --> 00:49:11,573
ah? What did you just say?

907
00:49:12,866 --> 00:49:14,451
You can confess your love during your study trip

908
00:49:14,993 --> 00:49:16,495
The study tour is pretty good

909
00:49:16,578 --> 00:49:18,205
There is a bonfire party and an atmosphere

910
00:49:18,288 --> 00:49:19,831
And you can wear casual clothes

911
00:49:20,707 --> 00:49:22,918
lie

912
00:49:32,803 --> 00:49:34,096
Borrow it

913
00:49:34,846 --> 00:49:36,974
Why are you here? Don't go to physical education classes?

914
00:49:37,057 --> 00:49:39,184
Want to put the valuables in class

915
00:49:39,267 --> 00:49:40,477
What is it?

916
00:49:44,898 --> 00:49:47,192
-Wow What is this?
-Wow What is this?

917
00:49:47,776 --> 00:49:50,237
Wow, it's really beautiful

918
00:49:50,862 --> 00:49:51,822
-Wow…
-Hey!

919
00:49:52,572 --> 00:49:53,949
Don't touch

920
00:49:54,574 --> 00:49:57,577
It's a valuable thing my aunt sent from the United States

921
00:49:57,661 --> 00:49:59,705
You're so worried

922
00:49:59,788 --> 00:50:01,331
Wouldn't it be better to stay in the classroom and watch it?

923
00:50:01,415 --> 00:50:03,792
Don't want it. Didn't you dodge the ball today?

924
00:50:04,459 --> 00:50:06,294
I like dodgeball

925
00:50:12,092 --> 00:50:14,845
Stop being slow, hurry up and find a partner

926
00:50:14,928 --> 00:50:17,222
Only those who hit the vest will be eliminated

927
00:50:18,056 --> 00:50:19,266
Want to team up with me?

928
00:50:19,349 --> 00:50:20,600
Ouch?

929
00:50:20,684 --> 00:50:21,935
-Takanishi
-OK

930
00:50:22,519 --> 00:50:24,104
Go get the vest, I'll cum

931
00:50:26,398 --> 00:50:27,232
cut

932
00:50:27,816 --> 00:50:28,650
What's wrong?

933
00:50:30,110 --> 00:50:31,028
Want to team up with me?

934
00:50:33,405 --> 00:50:34,448
All right

935
00:50:35,282 --> 00:50:37,367
OK Who will attack first next? One person will come out of each team

936
00:50:39,244 --> 00:50:40,078
Come

937
00:50:41,747 --> 00:50:42,581
Where is your team?

938
00:50:45,751 --> 00:50:46,752
You come

939
00:50:46,835 --> 00:50:47,669
Hello

940
00:50:48,253 --> 00:50:49,087
Um?

941
00:50:49,588 --> 00:50:50,422
-My?
-right

942
00:50:58,847 --> 00:51:00,390
It's about to start

943
00:51:02,225 --> 00:51:03,185
What's going on?

944
00:51:05,687 --> 00:51:06,897
Hit the front one!

945
00:51:16,156 --> 00:51:17,365
Hurry up and stop!

946
00:51:25,999 --> 00:51:27,000
Catch it!

947
00:51:35,467 --> 00:51:36,468
Are you crazy?

948
00:51:36,551 --> 00:51:39,596
I didn't hide on purpose...

949
00:51:46,311 --> 00:51:49,231
Ouch? How do you stick like glue

950
00:51:50,524 --> 00:51:51,733
ah?

951
00:52:01,451 --> 00:52:02,536
pretty!

952
00:52:04,454 --> 00:52:05,288
Cum now!

953
00:52:08,750 --> 00:52:09,918
Protect me Ma Luzhi!

954
00:52:16,758 --> 00:52:19,136
Class 7!

955
00:52:19,219 --> 00:52:21,847
Class 7!

956
00:52:21,930 --> 00:52:23,265
Eliminate Shili

957
00:52:23,348 --> 00:52:24,307
Take your hand back!

958
00:52:28,937 --> 00:52:29,771
Bai Cheng comes!

959
00:52:29,855 --> 00:52:30,856
pretty!

960
00:52:30,939 --> 00:52:32,774
-Did you do it on purpose?
-Front

961
00:52:33,692 --> 00:52:35,152
Pass the ball!

962
00:53:33,627 --> 00:53:34,753
-ah?
-What is she doing?

963
00:53:41,092 --> 00:53:43,178
Shi Yi Shi Li, are you okay?

964
00:53:43,261 --> 00:53:44,137
fine!

965
00:53:44,221 --> 00:53:45,222
What are you doing?

966
00:53:45,305 --> 00:53:46,556
-Go back
- Really

967
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:48,725
We're back

968
00:53:53,563 --> 00:53:54,856
Why

969
00:53:56,775 --> 00:54:00,362
Really

970
00:54:00,445 --> 00:54:01,738
My mother!

971
00:54:02,864 --> 00:54:03,698
Why!

972
00:54:04,699 --> 00:54:07,202
Park Se-ri, look at the good things you did

973
00:54:09,371 --> 00:54:10,330
(Han Yunxiu)

974
00:54:11,581 --> 00:54:13,917
Hello Han Yunxi I'm Park Se-ri

975
00:54:14,876 --> 00:54:15,919
What are you doing?

976
00:54:16,461 --> 00:54:17,295
well enough?

977
00:54:19,589 --> 00:54:21,341
Why

978
00:54:31,601 --> 00:54:34,437
Hello Han Yunxi I'm Park Se-ri

979
00:54:35,397 --> 00:54:37,399
I'm really sorry about what happened in physical education class

980
00:54:38,441 --> 00:54:41,361
I didn't do it on purpose

981
00:54:41,444 --> 00:54:43,530
I don't know why it's like that

982
00:54:44,447 --> 00:54:45,615
but

983
00:54:45,699 --> 00:54:47,367
Behind you, I feel very at ease

984
00:54:50,412 --> 00:54:53,081
ah? What am I talking about?

985
00:54:54,916 --> 00:54:56,251
Alas, it's really

986
00:55:00,380 --> 00:55:01,214
Um?

987
00:55:04,259 --> 00:55:05,176
Who is it?

988
00:55:05,844 --> 00:55:06,678
Um?

989
00:55:11,516 --> 00:55:14,019
There is a message

990
00:55:15,186 --> 00:55:16,021
Park Se-ri

991
00:55:16,688 --> 00:55:17,814
I am Kim Hyun from Class 4

992
00:55:20,150 --> 00:55:21,985
Have fun dodging the ball today

993
00:55:23,528 --> 00:55:25,447
The ball that was hit looks very painful

994
00:55:26,197 --> 00:55:27,407
Thanks to you, I'm not out

995
00:55:27,907 --> 00:55:28,742
Thanks

996
00:55:30,076 --> 00:55:30,910
See you next time

997
00:55:41,129 --> 00:55:41,963
ah

998
00:55:42,547 --> 00:55:45,133
There is a message

999
00:55:47,385 --> 00:55:48,720
Hello, I'm Yunxi

1000
00:55:49,637 --> 00:55:50,555
Is your face okay?

1001
00:55:51,848 --> 00:55:54,309
I seemed to be walking too suddenly in the afternoon

1002
00:55:55,310 --> 00:55:57,729
Don't worry I'm not angry

1003
00:55:59,898 --> 00:56:02,817
Don't apply eggs to your face to reduce swelling

1004
00:56:02,901 --> 00:56:04,694
There may be salmonella

1005
00:56:05,987 --> 00:56:08,573
Go to the pharmacy to buy some medicine and rub it will be better

1006
00:56:10,116 --> 00:56:12,035
Then see you tomorrow

1007
00:56:13,411 --> 00:56:14,287
goodbye

1008
00:57:10,677 --> 00:57:12,846
Just go here

1009
00:57:12,929 --> 00:57:14,848
-Um
-Power is the problem

1010
00:57:14,931 --> 00:57:17,892
That room Xiaying, you guys first set up this area

1011
00:57:18,393 --> 00:57:20,061
The key is power supply

1012
00:57:20,145 --> 00:57:22,272
-I will connect the power
-Hello!

1013
00:57:23,064 --> 00:57:24,357
-never mind
-Don't knock!

1014
00:57:24,441 --> 00:57:25,525
Everyone

1015
00:57:31,614 --> 00:57:32,574
-You stupid
-Hello!

1016
00:57:32,657 --> 00:57:33,950
-Oh how...
-fine

1017
00:57:34,659 --> 00:57:35,618
It's fine

1018
00:57:35,702 --> 00:57:36,995
Where did we just talk about?

1019
00:57:37,078 --> 00:57:37,912
for you

1020
00:57:37,996 --> 00:57:39,372
-power supply
- Right

1021
00:57:39,456 --> 00:57:41,124
-Where do you need to get the power supply?
-Um

1022
00:57:41,207 --> 00:57:42,041
Thanks

1023
00:57:42,125 --> 00:57:43,001
Here?

1024
00:57:43,084 --> 00:57:44,669
-That…
-I'll do it myself

1025
00:57:45,462 --> 00:57:47,922
Bai Chenglai I find you are good at doing this

1026
00:57:48,423 --> 00:57:50,633
Kim Hyun will definitely be fascinated by this, right?

1027
00:57:50,717 --> 00:57:53,219
Have you figured out your child's name? Make a reservation in advance

1028
00:57:53,303 --> 00:57:54,262
that

1029
00:57:54,345 --> 00:57:55,263
I'll leave first

1030
00:57:57,098 --> 00:57:57,932
Going away?

1031
00:57:58,016 --> 00:57:59,434
-Brother
- It's just started

1032
00:57:59,517 --> 00:58:00,810
There is also a task for the elder brother

1033
00:58:00,894 --> 00:58:01,728
knew

1034
00:58:03,021 --> 00:58:04,856
Then, do as you promised!

1035
00:58:08,818 --> 00:58:10,195
That's Park Chan-ho

1036
00:58:13,573 --> 00:58:14,824
(Mobile Graduation Studio)

1037
00:58:14,908 --> 00:58:15,742
Three two one!

1038
00:58:17,076 --> 00:58:18,077
very good

1039
00:58:18,161 --> 00:58:20,538
-Bai Chenglai
-You are wearing a treacherous official

1040
00:58:20,622 --> 00:58:22,874
-Your beard is about to be tied up
-A piece of seaweed was posted on the chin

1041
00:58:22,957 --> 00:58:23,958
-Why!
-This is sweet moss

1042
00:58:26,002 --> 00:58:27,295
Oh, Shili's dad

1043
00:58:27,378 --> 00:58:28,922
Let them do that

1044
00:58:29,005 --> 00:58:30,089
oh!

1045
00:58:30,173 --> 00:58:32,342
Player Park Se-ri and the caddie!

1046
00:58:35,094 --> 00:58:36,763
Come, like me

1047
00:58:36,846 --> 00:58:38,181
that's all

1048
00:58:38,264 --> 00:58:39,265
alright

1049
00:58:39,766 --> 00:58:40,767
Take off your socks

1050
00:58:41,309 --> 00:58:42,519
yes

1051
00:58:42,602 --> 00:58:43,645
Are you really here?

1052
00:58:43,728 --> 00:58:45,313
Dad, do you have to do it?

1053
00:58:46,940 --> 00:58:48,525
Really

1054
00:58:48,608 --> 00:58:49,442
ah!

1055
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:51,694
I'm going crazy

1056
00:58:52,403 --> 00:58:53,404
Why

1057
00:58:53,905 --> 00:58:56,407
Why make such a request?

1058
00:58:57,825 --> 00:58:58,660
Why

1059
00:58:59,369 --> 00:59:00,995
I really hate this hair

1060
00:59:01,746 --> 00:59:03,206
But I don't hate it

1061
00:59:05,833 --> 00:59:06,751
Already ready?

1062
00:59:08,836 --> 00:59:12,382
OK, I'm going to take a photo. Let's pose!

1063
00:59:14,259 --> 00:59:15,301
That ball boy

1064
00:59:15,385 --> 00:59:17,095
-Let's laugh together
-Smile more

1065
00:59:17,679 --> 00:59:19,055
-OK
-Get a smile!

1066
00:59:19,556 --> 00:59:21,099
Why is your face so stiff?

1067
00:59:21,599 --> 00:59:22,559
Come and be excited!

1068
00:59:23,059 --> 00:59:23,893
Yes, very good!

1069
00:59:32,026 --> 00:59:33,027
Hello

1070
00:59:33,111 --> 00:59:34,404
Shili is here

1071
00:59:35,405 --> 00:59:37,031
- Very hot
-Ouch sorry

1072
00:59:37,115 --> 00:59:39,033
Is it okay? Really sorry

1073
00:59:39,117 --> 00:59:40,243
Shili

1074
00:59:40,326 --> 00:59:42,620
I'm very busy now

1075
00:59:42,704 --> 00:59:44,831
Go to the washbasin to wait for a while

1076
00:59:44,914 --> 00:59:45,999
OK

1077
00:59:47,709 --> 00:59:49,377
-Ah very hot
-Ouch

1078
00:59:49,460 --> 00:59:50,295
Scare me

1079
00:59:50,378 --> 00:59:52,046
Sorry, you're hot

1080
00:59:52,130 --> 00:59:53,006
good

1081
00:59:55,967 --> 00:59:57,093
Yunxi is here

1082
00:59:57,176 --> 00:59:59,095
Help me wash Shili's hair

1083
00:59:59,762 --> 01:00:00,597
ah?

1084
01:00:00,680 --> 01:00:02,265
Will Yunxi come to wash?

1085
01:00:03,224 --> 01:00:04,809
He's very good at washing his hair

1086
01:00:04,892 --> 01:00:05,893
ah…

1087
01:00:07,020 --> 01:00:09,522
-ah!
-Oh sorry

1088
01:00:09,606 --> 01:00:10,440
Ouch

1089
01:00:19,949 --> 01:00:20,992
So

1090
01:00:23,161 --> 01:00:24,120
Going to wash

1091
01:00:25,622 --> 01:00:26,456
Um

1092
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:34,714
-ah!
-ah!

1093
01:00:34,797 --> 01:00:35,882
sorry

1094
01:00:35,965 --> 01:00:36,799
Is it okay?

1095
01:00:36,883 --> 01:00:37,717
ah…

1096
01:00:46,809 --> 01:00:47,644
I've done it again

1097
01:00:48,603 --> 01:00:49,562
Um

1098
01:01:03,409 --> 01:01:04,786
alright

1099
01:01:06,579 --> 01:01:08,539
Please go slowly

1100
01:01:08,623 --> 01:01:10,124
Are you very satisfied?

1101
01:01:10,208 --> 01:01:11,709
The effect is very good!

1102
01:01:11,793 --> 01:01:12,627
Is it true?

1103
01:01:12,710 --> 01:01:13,753
Of course

1104
01:01:14,337 --> 01:01:17,131
Then I'll have a meal in Qingshapu

1105
01:01:17,215 --> 01:01:19,509
Welcome to come again next time. Don’t wash your hair today!

1106
01:01:19,592 --> 01:01:20,426
OK!

1107
01:01:21,302 --> 01:01:22,136
oops

1108
01:01:24,305 --> 01:01:25,264
Excuse me

1109
01:01:25,348 --> 01:01:27,975
Is he also doing Seoul magic straight hair?

1110
01:01:28,059 --> 01:01:29,310
yes

1111
01:01:30,645 --> 01:01:32,647
I see

1112
01:01:32,730 --> 01:01:33,773
Huh?

1113
01:01:33,856 --> 01:01:34,691
how so?

1114
01:01:35,191 --> 01:01:36,025
A little weird

1115
01:01:36,734 --> 01:01:37,568
ah?

1116
01:01:38,861 --> 01:01:39,696
Yunxi

1117
01:01:40,196 --> 01:01:42,448
Did you use conditioner?

1118
01:01:43,449 --> 01:01:45,159
Is that conditioner?

1119
01:01:45,243 --> 01:01:47,912
How can I use conditioner if I want to perm my hair?

1120
01:01:47,995 --> 01:01:49,580
The medication doesn't work

1121
01:01:50,164 --> 01:01:51,124
Yeah?

1122
01:01:51,207 --> 01:01:54,001
Don't pretend you don't know. You know very well

1123
01:01:54,085 --> 01:01:58,172
What's going on if you don't make such mistakes?

1124
01:01:58,256 --> 01:02:00,007
Mom, I'll go out

1125
01:02:01,300 --> 01:02:02,593
Hello, where are you going?

1126
01:02:03,428 --> 01:02:04,387
What happened to this kid today...

1127
01:02:04,929 --> 01:02:05,763
Why

1128
01:02:06,431 --> 01:02:08,141
Shili Sorry

1129
01:02:08,224 --> 01:02:09,767
Wash your hair again

1130
01:02:09,851 --> 01:02:10,977
Come quickly

1131
01:02:13,354 --> 01:02:14,313
Get in the car quickly

1132
01:02:19,694 --> 01:02:20,820
Quiet!

1133
01:02:24,073 --> 01:02:25,950
Who can contact Park Se-ri?

1134
01:02:27,452 --> 01:02:29,370
Huh? She's here

1135
01:03:03,488 --> 01:03:04,906
-Wow, so beautiful!
-It's really beautiful

1136
01:03:04,989 --> 01:03:06,616
All straightened!

1137
01:03:07,116 --> 01:03:09,035
Very smooth texture

1138
01:03:15,500 --> 01:03:17,043
Very beautiful, worth spending the money

1139
01:03:31,474 --> 01:03:32,475
No matter how loud it is!

1140
01:03:51,410 --> 01:03:52,620
Hello, teacher!

1141
01:03:52,703 --> 01:03:53,704
Hello

1142
01:03:53,788 --> 01:03:55,373
-Hello
-Hello

1143
01:03:57,542 --> 01:03:59,335
Let’s see here!

1144
01:04:15,351 --> 01:04:16,269
Photographed

1145
01:04:16,352 --> 01:04:17,687
Take another photo

1146
01:04:18,437 --> 01:04:19,814
Take a photo with Yuanying

1147
01:04:23,359 --> 01:04:25,111
Three two one

1148
01:04:25,653 --> 01:04:26,571
OK!

1149
01:04:26,654 --> 01:04:27,738
Three two one!

1150
01:04:37,456 --> 01:04:38,708
very good

1151
01:04:43,004 --> 01:04:44,046
"Letter to parents

1152
01:04:46,090 --> 01:04:47,216
Father Mother

1153
01:04:47,300 --> 01:04:48,509
I'm Shangzhe

1154
01:04:50,052 --> 01:04:52,805
You must have worked very hard lately

1155
01:04:54,515 --> 01:04:57,435
Last year due to the financial crisis
The situation at home becomes difficult

1156
01:04:58,686 --> 01:05:01,689
But I'm ignorant and fucked
Make your heart uncomfortable

1157
01:05:02,940 --> 01:05:03,941
Father Mother

1158
01:05:04,775 --> 01:05:05,902
You always

1159
01:05:06,944 --> 01:05:08,446
Say sorry to me

1160
01:05:10,781 --> 01:05:12,533
But what did you do wrong?

1161
01:05:14,660 --> 01:05:18,414
You have always supported me..."

1162
01:05:28,966 --> 01:05:30,176
Come on

1163
01:05:30,259 --> 01:05:31,135
Um

1164
01:05:36,807 --> 01:05:38,559
-Wow
-Oh my God

1165
01:05:39,060 --> 01:05:40,728
Really beautiful

1166
01:05:41,437 --> 01:05:42,980
-Wow
-Thanks for your hard work

1167
01:05:43,481 --> 01:05:44,315
- Very pretty
-Wow

1168
01:05:44,899 --> 01:05:45,733
elder brother

1169
01:05:46,359 --> 01:05:47,193
Where is the blanket?

1170
01:05:51,030 --> 01:05:52,239
oh

1171
01:05:58,871 --> 01:06:00,790
Park Se-ri, are you ready?

1172
01:06:01,791 --> 01:06:03,834
Focus on you

1173
01:06:03,918 --> 01:06:05,211
You're pretty now

1174
01:06:05,294 --> 01:06:06,128
-OK
- Very beautiful

1175
01:06:06,212 --> 01:06:07,713
-Did you understand?
-I'll do it

1176
01:06:09,006 --> 01:06:10,633
“I will repay my kindness

1177
01:06:12,468 --> 01:06:13,344
Thank you

1178
01:06:14,220 --> 01:06:15,805
I'm sorry, either..."

1179
01:06:15,888 --> 01:06:16,764
Scare me

1180
01:06:16,847 --> 01:06:18,557
-"…I love you all"
- Come with me

1181
01:06:18,641 --> 01:06:19,475
Why?

1182
01:06:20,059 --> 01:06:22,770
"If there is a next life, I will be your son."

1183
01:06:28,442 --> 01:06:30,361
-hurry up
-Wait a moment

1184
01:06:33,072 --> 01:06:33,990
Hello you

1185
01:06:34,865 --> 01:06:38,869
I am Park Hongyi, an exclusive photographer at Jialan High School

1186
01:06:44,625 --> 01:06:45,459
Go and have a look

1187
01:06:47,086 --> 01:06:47,962
-Towards this?
-Um

1188
01:07:17,867 --> 01:07:18,784
Come here Come here

1189
01:07:18,868 --> 01:07:20,286
-Hey
- Let it go

1190
01:07:21,996 --> 01:07:22,830
sit down

1191
01:07:30,963 --> 01:07:33,591
Who turned on the light?

1192
01:07:37,803 --> 01:07:38,637
very beautiful

1193
01:07:39,138 --> 01:07:40,514
yes

1194
01:07:44,185 --> 01:07:45,436
Hair is suitable for you

1195
01:07:47,563 --> 01:07:48,397
Um…

1196
01:07:55,696 --> 01:07:56,530
Thousand Paper Cranes

1197
01:07:57,865 --> 01:07:58,866
Did you give it to me?

1198
01:07:58,949 --> 01:08:02,161
How did you know?

1199
01:08:02,244 --> 01:08:05,039
The bottom of the bottle reads "Park Hongyi"

1200
01:08:05,122 --> 01:08:06,207
Isn't it your dad?

1201
01:08:07,208 --> 01:08:08,292
Very cute

1202
01:08:08,959 --> 01:08:11,045
And the last time you blocked the ball

1203
01:08:11,837 --> 01:08:13,214
Your motor nerves are really good

1204
01:08:13,881 --> 01:08:15,091
Um

1205
01:08:16,217 --> 01:08:17,051
Too

1206
01:08:17,718 --> 01:08:19,637
Have you swam in our sea

1207
01:08:20,596 --> 01:08:21,639
"Our sea"?

1208
01:08:23,265 --> 01:08:25,726
It's the sea that only you and I know

1209
01:08:29,271 --> 01:08:30,648
ah? What are you talking about?

1210
01:08:30,731 --> 01:08:32,358
What?

1211
01:08:32,441 --> 01:08:33,567
Can you hear it?

1212
01:08:46,622 --> 01:08:47,456
But

1213
01:08:48,666 --> 01:08:51,127
Call me out. Do you have something to say?

1214
01:08:55,297 --> 01:08:56,549
Yes, right

1215
01:08:57,216 --> 01:08:58,050
That's right

1216
01:09:01,971 --> 01:09:03,556
Tell me quickly I'm a little nervous

1217
01:09:05,516 --> 01:09:06,350
Um…

1218
01:09:08,561 --> 01:09:10,187
-What are you doing?
-Um?

1219
01:09:10,271 --> 01:09:11,355
What are you talking about?

1220
01:09:11,438 --> 01:09:12,857
Don't move I can't hear

1221
01:09:13,357 --> 01:09:14,191
ah…

1222
01:09:23,617 --> 01:09:24,451
Kim Hyun

1223
01:09:25,161 --> 01:09:25,995
Um

1224
01:09:27,580 --> 01:09:29,748
I used to like you very much

1225
01:09:32,126 --> 01:09:34,336
I heard you like straight hair, so I went to pull my hair

1226
01:09:35,004 --> 01:09:36,839
I also think of you and broke those paper cranes

1227
01:09:39,425 --> 01:09:40,259
but

1228
01:09:41,802 --> 01:09:44,597
When I want to confess to you

1229
01:09:45,389 --> 01:09:47,391
I keep thinking of another person

1230
01:09:56,984 --> 01:09:58,402
-Huh? Going away
-Go away

1231
01:09:58,485 --> 01:09:59,653
Follow up

1232
01:10:11,248 --> 01:10:12,082
Have you confessed?

1233
01:10:12,708 --> 01:10:14,043
Today is the first day?

1234
01:10:14,710 --> 01:10:15,753
Don't know, don't ask

1235
01:10:16,754 --> 01:10:17,963
Ah Why?

1236
01:10:18,047 --> 01:10:19,131
What's going on?

1237
01:10:19,715 --> 01:10:21,425
Speak softly and you will be heard

1238
01:10:35,522 --> 01:10:39,652
I always thought
Only when I get better will someone like me

1239
01:10:40,778 --> 01:10:44,865
I always think it's better and more beautiful

1240
01:10:46,825 --> 01:10:47,660
But

1241
01:10:48,661 --> 01:10:52,081
I wouldn't have such a thought in front of him

1242
01:10:53,582 --> 01:10:54,416
Yeah?

1243
01:11:03,842 --> 01:11:04,677
Why

1244
01:11:05,261 --> 01:11:07,179
I don't know who it is, but I'm a little envious

1245
01:11:12,059 --> 01:11:13,352
You seem to really like him

1246
01:11:17,064 --> 01:11:18,190
is that so?

1247
01:12:00,774 --> 01:12:01,608
Huh?

1248
01:12:54,078 --> 01:12:56,705
I bought the second volume of "Auth"

1249
01:12:59,208 --> 01:13:00,084
oh

1250
01:13:05,047 --> 01:13:07,591
I have to review, can't read it first

1251
01:13:11,261 --> 01:13:13,806
But you can't just take it away just because it looks good

1252
01:13:13,889 --> 01:13:15,724
I'll study hard when I finish the exam

1253
01:13:28,821 --> 01:13:29,655
Why

1254
01:13:30,322 --> 01:13:33,033
This hair is too slippery

1255
01:13:49,508 --> 01:13:50,509
Han Yunxi

1256
01:13:53,512 --> 01:13:55,848
Do you have nothing to ask?

1257
01:14:00,561 --> 01:14:01,437
Want to ask?

1258
01:14:02,688 --> 01:14:03,939
My confession to Kim Hyun

1259
01:14:05,816 --> 01:14:06,692
Are you not curious?

1260
01:14:09,236 --> 01:14:10,571
What happened later?

1261
01:14:12,448 --> 01:14:13,282
At once

1262
01:14:13,782 --> 01:14:14,658
No confession

1263
01:14:20,914 --> 01:14:21,748
Why?

1264
01:14:24,668 --> 01:14:25,502
nothing

1265
01:14:26,170 --> 01:14:27,337
Want to concentrate on studying

1266
01:14:30,674 --> 01:14:31,717
ah

1267
01:14:31,800 --> 01:14:34,720
Don't tell them they'll be disappointed

1268
01:14:36,054 --> 01:14:36,889
OK

1269
01:14:40,893 --> 01:14:41,852
Han Yunxi

1270
01:14:44,438 --> 01:14:47,357
Can you buy me a huge exam candy?

1271
01:14:49,276 --> 01:14:50,110
Um…

1272
01:14:51,737 --> 01:14:53,530
Will you do well in the exam if you have a bigger sugar?

1273
01:14:54,239 --> 01:14:55,491
Alas, it's really

1274
01:14:56,241 --> 01:14:58,118
Forget it, you'd better go read a book

1275
01:14:58,744 --> 01:14:59,828
Really

1276
01:15:02,039 --> 01:15:07,711
(There are 8 days left before the college entrance examination)

1277
01:15:09,880 --> 01:15:11,006
Bai Chenglai

1278
01:15:12,299 --> 01:15:14,510
It's so noisy, is it good for others to study

1279
01:15:14,593 --> 01:15:17,971
Now is not the time to study
You have to practice the luck of getting the questions

1280
01:15:18,847 --> 01:15:19,681
Why

1281
01:15:20,474 --> 01:15:23,352
If it weren't for the class teacher's punishment
You should be able to learn more

1282
01:15:26,230 --> 01:15:28,482
I really hope it ends soon

1283
01:15:28,565 --> 01:15:29,942
Then go see the sea

1284
01:15:30,484 --> 01:15:32,027
The sea in winter is really beautiful

1285
01:15:32,694 --> 01:15:36,865
When it snows
The stone tomb by the sea will look like a snowball

1286
01:15:38,408 --> 01:15:40,786
You're obviously a person by the sea
Why do you like the sea so much?

1287
01:15:41,828 --> 01:15:43,705
And have you ever seen snow in Busan?

1288
01:15:44,414 --> 01:15:46,500
Maybe it will go

1289
01:15:54,383 --> 01:15:55,217
Hey

1290
01:15:56,301 --> 01:15:57,135
ah?

1291
01:15:57,678 --> 01:15:59,012
Isn’t that Brother Yunxi?

1292
01:16:00,013 --> 01:16:00,847
ah?

1293
01:16:01,348 --> 01:16:03,433
Isn’t that Gao Renshi?

1294
01:16:06,645 --> 01:16:07,479
Why…

1295
01:16:20,867 --> 01:16:22,327
Where did you get it?

1296
01:16:22,911 --> 01:16:24,830
Shili said she wanted a huge exam candy

1297
01:16:26,748 --> 01:16:27,749
Isn't it too big?

1298
01:16:29,042 --> 01:16:30,419
The bigger the better, isn't it?

1299
01:16:33,130 --> 01:16:33,964
I want to

1300
01:16:34,840 --> 01:16:36,466
Go and take the college entrance examination next year

1301
01:16:39,136 --> 01:16:40,012
real?

1302
01:16:46,351 --> 01:16:48,061
Don’t you even want to take the exam even if you die?

1303
01:16:50,480 --> 01:16:51,315
I don't know either

1304
01:16:51,898 --> 01:16:53,066
It seems like it's okay now

1305
01:16:59,239 --> 01:17:00,073
What's wrong?

1306
01:17:05,537 --> 01:17:06,371
for you

1307
01:17:07,706 --> 01:17:08,540
What's this?

1308
01:17:09,124 --> 01:17:11,043
Didn’t you want a huge exam candy?

1309
01:17:14,129 --> 01:17:15,088
ah

1310
01:17:16,131 --> 01:17:16,965
Um

1311
01:17:17,966 --> 01:17:18,967
Thank you

1312
01:17:19,635 --> 01:17:20,552

Takanishi?

1318
01:17:43,325 --> 01:17:44,159
No

1319
01:17:44,868 --> 01:17:47,579
Then why do you two meet alone?

1320
01:17:52,668 --> 01:17:55,962
All friends from the same school
Can't meet alone?

1321
01:17:56,463 --> 01:17:57,381
friend?

1322
01:17:58,048 --> 01:18:00,425
When did you become friends with Gao Inshi?

1323
01:18:02,969 --> 01:18:04,805

01:18:27,494 --> 01:18:29,246
- Come to you
-I'm really sorry

1331
01:18:29,788 --> 01:18:31,373
Dad can't give it to you today

1332
01:18:31,456 --> 01:18:33,875
It's okay Dad, I'm not young again

1333
01:18:33,959 --> 01:18:36,211
Anyway, the exam room is close, I can walk alone

1334
01:18:36,294 --> 01:18:37,504

Shili

1338
01:18:42,801 --> 01:18:44,594
Do you want your mother to come and give it to you?

1339
01:18:44,678 --> 01:18:46,304
Oops It's OK

1340

You go and send Huili

1341
01:18:47,723 --> 01:18:49,516
How great it would be if it was an exam room

01:19:40,984 --> 01:19:42,694
Come on!

1356
01:19:44,279 --> 01:19:45,363
Hello!

1357
01:19:49,743 --> 01:19:50,911
Park Se-ri

1358
01:19:50,994 --> 01:19:52,204
Come on the college entrance examination

1359
01:19:53,705 --> 01:19:54,956
Thanks

1360
01:20:00,128 --> 01:20:00,962
oops

1361
01:20:04,007 --> 01:20:04,841
High high!

1362
01:20:10,013 --> 01:20:11,056
come on!

1363
01:20:19,898 --> 01:20:22,943
Two times two equals four

1364
01:20:23,026 --> 01:20:24,110
-so…
-Four Very good

1365
01:20:24,194 --> 01:20:26,154
There are four answers

1366
01:20:26,238 --> 01:20:28,698
Oh, when will my stomach hurt?

1367
01:20:28,782 --> 01:20:30,325
Why

1368
01:20:30,408 --> 01:20:32,035
Can you travel in this state?

1369
01:20:32,118 --> 01:20:33,578
When are you going to talk about?

1370
01:20:39,334 --> 01:20:40,168
Shili

1371
01:20:41,920 --> 01:20:43,547
You'll...

1372
01:20:44,130 --> 01:20:46,299
Is it wrong to answer?

1373
01:20:47,259 --> 01:20:49,302
Compound interest every six months...

1374
01:20:51,972 --> 01:20:54,099
I seem to have all answer sheets painted back

1375
01:20:55,642 --> 01:20:56,810
Hello

1376
01:20:56,893 --> 01:20:58,311
It's OK That one

1377
01:20:58,395 --> 01:20:59,521
Maybe it's a mistake

1378
01:20:59,604 --> 01:21:01,606
Instead, you can get high scores

1379
01:21:03,608 --> 01:21:04,442
Um?

1380
01:21:05,068 --> 01:21:06,444
Maybe it's really possible

1381
01:21:12,534 --> 01:21:13,368
sit down

1382
01:21:15,912 --> 01:21:17,038
Everyone

1383
01:21:18,331 --> 01:21:19,165
Thank you for your hard work

1384
01:21:21,585 --> 01:21:25,338
What else is saying
The guy who failed the exam because he was fined

1385
01:21:26,756 --> 01:21:29,092
It was the teacher who made excuses for you

1386
01:21:29,175 --> 01:21:31,344
Anyway, I didn't do well in the exam, right?

1387
01:21:31,428 --> 01:21:32,262
So

1388
01:21:33,013 --> 01:21:34,556
All the results are out, but they can't be changed

1389
01:21:35,181 --> 01:21:36,182
So start now

1390
01:21:36,766 --> 01:21:38,226
Go and play

1391
01:21:38,310 --> 01:21:39,936
good!

1392
01:21:40,437 --> 01:21:43,940
And guys with ideas
At 7pm, we gathered at Pigtrotter Street

1393
01:21:46,735 --> 01:21:47,652
Pig's trotter!

1394
01:21:51,990 --> 01:21:53,742
So empty, why don’t you go and eat fried rice cakes?

1395
01:21:54,326 --> 01:21:55,160
Fried rice cakes are good

1396
01:21:55,952 --> 01:21:58,538
Do you still have an appetite at this time?

1397
01:21:59,039 --> 01:22:00,081
certainly

1398
01:22:00,165 --> 01:22:01,374
Alas that

1399
01:22:01,875 --> 01:22:04,502
Mom asked me to run errands, I'll leave first

1400
01:22:04,586 --> 01:22:05,837
-Don't eat together?
-Um

1401
01:22:06,546 --> 01:22:07,422
Um

1402
01:22:07,505 --> 01:22:08,715
-Go slow
-goodbye

1403
01:22:11,009 --> 01:22:13,511
I have something to do, you guys go and eat it

1404
01:22:14,012 --> 01:22:14,846
Yeah?

1405
01:22:14,930 --> 01:22:16,181
I wanted to eat together

1406
01:22:16,264 --> 01:22:17,432
Um…

1407
01:22:17,515 --> 01:22:18,350
Walk slowly

1408
01:22:22,729 --> 01:22:23,563
Um?

1409
01:22:40,830 --> 01:22:41,665
Shili

1410
01:22:45,043 --> 01:22:46,086
What's wrong?

1411
01:23:14,531 --> 01:23:15,532
Do you want to take a walk again?

1412
01:23:16,783 --> 01:23:17,867
Yeah?

1413
01:23:18,618 --> 01:23:19,452
OK!

1414
01:23:22,998 --> 01:23:23,999
I'm the first place!

1415
01:23:24,082 --> 01:23:25,625
Wait a minute and let’s go together!

1416
01:23:30,630 --> 01:23:31,464
well

1417
01:23:34,801 --> 01:23:36,052
You follow quickly

1418
01:23:37,178 --> 01:23:38,013
careful

1419
01:23:42,642 --> 01:23:43,476
Hello

1420
01:23:49,357 --> 01:23:50,400
You still remember

1421
01:23:50,984 --> 01:23:52,861
Am I saving you here?

1422
01:23:52,944 --> 01:23:54,779
- Of course remember
-Um

1423
01:23:55,363 --> 01:23:58,158
What did you think? He actually jumped into the sea?

1424
01:24:00,994 --> 01:24:02,078
Want to tell the truth?

1425
01:24:05,248 --> 01:24:06,124
On that day

1426
01:24:07,792 --> 01:24:11,004
I was wondering what would happen if I was caught in the sea

1427
01:24:13,798 --> 01:24:15,091
I was too tired at that time

1428
01:24:20,555 --> 01:24:21,556
But what's funny is

1429
01:24:22,390 --> 01:24:23,933
Someone is swimming there

1430
01:24:27,896 --> 01:24:28,938
And enjoyed swimming

1431
01:24:43,119 --> 01:24:44,120
Huh?

1432
01:24:45,121 --> 01:24:46,956
-This is…
-I was the one who took away the famous brand

1433
01:24:48,500 --> 01:24:50,502
I want to remember the student who saved me

1434
01:24:54,506 --> 01:24:57,133
Fortunately, you are the one who saved me

1435
01:25:15,110 --> 01:25:15,944
Park Se-ri

1436
01:25:22,867 --> 01:25:23,868
I like you

1437
01:25:57,026 --> 01:25:58,611
We're back

1438
01:26:00,905 --> 01:26:01,739
Yes

1439
01:26:02,615 --> 01:26:03,449
Um

1440
01:26:08,371 --> 01:26:09,205
that

1441
01:26:10,039 --> 01:26:12,584
Are you free on Sunday?

1442
01:26:15,670 --> 01:26:16,713
I'm going to see you

1443
01:26:20,049 --> 01:26:21,509
Yes OK

1444
01:26:23,094 --> 01:26:23,928
All right

1445
01:26:24,429 --> 01:26:25,847
See you that day

1446
01:26:28,057 --> 01:26:28,892
Um?

1447
01:27:56,562 --> 01:27:57,480
Mother

1448
01:27:57,563 --> 01:27:58,439
Um

1449
01:27:59,691 --> 01:28:00,608
Come?

1450
01:28:02,485 --> 01:28:03,486
Mother

1451
01:28:03,569 --> 01:28:06,364
This Sunday I plan to visit Seoul

1452
01:28:07,865 --> 01:28:08,700
So sudden?

1453
01:28:09,200 --> 01:28:11,619
I heard that new equipment has been entered by the general agent of Seoul

1454
01:28:12,453 --> 01:28:15,498
You know, too
Our hairdressing hospital is entirely supported by machines

1455
01:28:16,207 --> 01:28:17,292
Then I'll go together, too

1456
01:28:18,001 --> 01:28:18,835
Need not

1457
01:28:18,918 --> 01:28:21,963
If the door suddenly closes, the guest will find it strange

1458
01:28:22,046 --> 01:28:24,590
You can stay and come to the store and explain it to me

1459
01:28:25,300 --> 01:28:26,134
OK

1460
01:28:27,844 --> 01:28:29,095
Are you all ready?

1461
01:28:29,762 --> 01:28:32,640
I'll be on a trip and I'll be in good condition.

1462
01:28:33,516 --> 01:28:36,311
Don't worry, leave it to me by Busan

1463
01:28:38,104 --> 01:28:39,147
Too reliable

1464
01:28:39,230 --> 01:28:41,149
It's leaving Shili

1465
01:28:41,232 --> 01:28:42,817
See you on Sunday

1466
01:28:42,900 --> 01:28:44,736
Yes, a pleasant trip

1467
01:28:44,819 --> 01:28:46,195
OK, I'm leaving

1468
01:28:46,279 --> 01:28:47,655
Um! goodbye!

1469
01:28:47,739 --> 01:28:48,573
goodbye!

1470
01:28:48,656 --> 01:28:49,657
Yes Goodbye!

1471
01:28:52,285 --> 01:28:54,537
-Go away!
-knew!

1472
01:28:54,620 --> 01:28:56,164
Come out quickly

1473
01:28:56,247 --> 01:28:58,708
Hello Ma Luzhi This Sunday Guang'anli, right?

1474
01:28:58,791 --> 01:29:02,211
In the end, I really want to ask you, I can only rely on you

1475
01:29:02,295 --> 01:29:03,129
Thank you really

1476
01:29:04,714 --> 01:29:05,548
Have you heard it all?

1477
01:29:06,674 --> 01:29:09,177
This is the last battle we did when we were a student

1478
01:29:18,269 --> 01:29:19,228
Not cold?

1479
01:29:20,521 --> 01:29:21,689
Even if it's cold

1480
01:29:22,190 --> 01:29:24,525
Still have to come out to see the stars

1481
01:29:25,735 --> 01:29:26,611
We Huili

1482
01:29:27,195 --> 01:29:28,029
We Shili

1483
01:29:28,654 --> 01:29:30,573
To realize all dreams

1484
01:29:31,240 --> 01:29:32,784
Live happily

1485
01:29:36,204 --> 01:29:37,330
And slow

1486
01:29:37,413 --> 01:29:38,247
Where is me?

1487
01:29:39,582 --> 01:29:41,042
Haven't you achieved it?

1488
01:29:41,125 --> 01:29:41,959
What dream?

1489
01:29:42,919 --> 01:29:45,088
Isn’t your dream to marry me?

1490
01:29:45,171 --> 01:29:46,422
Oh my god, go crazy

1491
01:29:47,757 --> 01:29:48,966
-Speechless
-Hey

1492
01:29:49,050 --> 01:29:50,343
When you confessed

1493
01:29:50,426 --> 01:29:52,762
He also said, "My dream is to marry you", right?

1494
01:29:52,845 --> 01:29:54,472
It's so noisy, stinky old man

1495
01:29:58,559 --> 01:30:00,770
Do it now!

1496
01:30:00,853 --> 01:30:01,813
Is this done?

1497
01:30:01,896 --> 01:30:02,730
-so?
-No

1498
01:30:04,565 --> 01:30:05,858
- Just plug it in, right?
-Um

Um?

1510

It's okay, it's not cold

1511
01:30:46,482 --> 01:30:48,151

Not now, go in first

1520
01:31:25,021 --> 01:31:26,397
Um? She said to go to the side

1521
01:31:27,106 --> 01:31:28,024
-To the right

1522
01:31:28,107 --> 01:31:28,941

1550

Not even a greeting

1552
01:34:25,242 --> 01:34:26,952
Your mother fell down the stairs

1553
01:34:28,037 --> 01:34:30,122
You know, she's usually clumsy

1554
01:34:31,540 --> 01:34:33,250
I heard you didn’t even take the college entrance examination?

1555
01:34:37,213 --> 01:34:39,423
A mom, don't care about education

1556
01:34:40,091 --> 01:34:41,384
I'll talk about something or not

1557
01:34:48,599 --> 01:34:50,267
So you treated her like this?

1558
01:34:58,359 --> 01:35:01,278
That's why I said your mother's words were simply unbelievable

1559
01:35:02,738 --> 01:35:05,616
Say you are cheerful and happy over there

1560
01:35:07,243 --> 01:35:09,036
It turns out to be both rude and brainless

Wouldn't it be better if I say it?

1566
01:35:44,780 --> 01:35:47,908
My mother said it was a real estate agent who called me.

1567
01:35:49,118 --> 01:35:51,036
It seems that the procedures have been completed

1568
01:35:52,037 --> 01:35:54,915

1588
01:38:08,299 --> 01:38:10,926
She said she would never be able to get out once she returned to her home in Seoul

1589
01:38:16,181 --> 01:38:17,808
Should we go?

1590

01:48:05,896 --> 01:48:08,064
- Here is a 500ml raw beer
-Hello

1681
01:48:08,148 --> 01:48:09,566
You have to do a blind date tomorrow

1682
01:48:10,775 --> 01:48:12,152
I didn't say I wanted to go

1683
01:48:12,235 --> 01:48:13,069
Hello!

1684
01:48:14,404 --> 01:48:15,739
Not coming?

1685
01:48:17,407 --> 01:48:19,826
It's clear that the best place is left

1686
01:48:19,910 --> 01:48:20,994
Good location?

1687
01:48:21,912 --> 01:48:24,456
That's a good place to confess

1688
01:48:25,040 --> 01:48:26,208
boss

1689
01:48:26,291 --> 01:48:27,459
Didn’t you agree to keep it confidential?

1690
01:48:27,542 --> 01:48:29,085
Why did you say it all!

1691
01:48:29,920 --> 01:48:30,754
Yes

1692
01:48:31,254 --> 01:48:32,214
It doesn't matter

1693
01:48:33,048 --> 01:48:37,719
If you confess your love there
You can do it too

1694
01:48:38,595 --> 01:48:41,014
My baby from Seoul

1695
01:48:42,307 --> 01:48:43,308
Meet there too

1696
01:48:47,646 --> 01:48:48,480
Honey!

1697
01:48:49,814 --> 01:48:50,857
OK

1698
01:48:51,358 --> 01:48:52,234

1699
01:48:55,403 --> 01:48:56,279
Must come

1700
01:48:56,780 --> 01:48:58,406
Yes, you must go

1701
01:48:59,407 --> 01:49:00,367
Why

1702
01:49:01,159 --> 01:49:02,577
There are couples from all directions

1703
01:49:07,916 --> 01:49:11,878
Shi Yi Shi Li You must come on a blind date tomorrow!

1704
01:49:12,712 --> 01:49:14,839
For my sake, I must come!

1705
01:49:29,646 --> 01:49:30,564
Please go slowly

1706
01:49:37,028 --> 01:49:38,530
Are you worried about it?

1707
01:49:41,449 --> 01:49:42,284
ah

1708
01:49:43,118 --> 01:49:43,952
that…

1709
01:49:44,786 --> 01:49:47,038
I used to be by the sea

1710
01:49:47,539 --> 01:49:51,418
Prepare for the most important confession in life

1711
01:49:52,794 --> 01:49:53,920
Has the confession been successful?

1712
01:49:55,797 --> 01:49:58,383
If it succeeds, I won't sit here,

1713
01:49:59,217 --> 01:50:00,927
Who will meet? No one can tell who it is

1714
01:50:01,928 --> 01:50:03,555
Like me, I actually live in Busan

1715
01:50:31,875 --> 01:50:37,922
(Excuse me
Not very comfortable and can't go to a blind date)

1716
01:50:49,142 --> 01:50:49,976
Um?

1717
01:50:50,560 --> 01:50:52,896
(Does your body look good?)

1718
01:50:53,855 --> 01:50:54,689
Um?

1719
01:51:02,364 --> 01:51:04,282
Hello, what's the matter?

1720
01:51:06,743 --> 01:51:07,619

01:53:16,998 --> 01:53:19,000
Still paying pager fees

1744
01:53:27,926 --> 01:53:30,053
