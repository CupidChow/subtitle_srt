1
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:11,280
Why are you looking at me?

2
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:13,760
My wife.

3
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:14,960
I can't look.

4
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,120
You can't.

5
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:19,000
You won't let me see it?

6
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:21,120
Can I see it?

7
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:23,039
Your Highness.

8
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:27,680
What's wrong, Your Majesty?

9
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:28,920
Your Majesty.

10
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:29,960
His Majesty...

11
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:30,840
passed away.

12
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,479
What are you doing here?

13
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,000
Ruyi told me.

14
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:59,600
I found these in Shangguan Jingmao's study.

15
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,600
See if it's evidence of his rebellion.

16
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:06,280
I don't know what you've been investigating these years.

17
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,840
These things are with Shangguan Jingmao.

18
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,199
I can't find them.

19
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,120
Why did you help me?

20
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,520
I'm here to help Ruyi.

21
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:20,079
We can only be free

22
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,560
can we be free

23
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,160
Although I don't know

24
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,760
why Ruyi chose you,

25
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,560
But I respect her.

26
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,280
You don't have to thank me.

27
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:35,000
We can't be friends.

28
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,079
Be good to her.

29
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,360
Or I will kill you.

30
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:54,240
Princess, Lord Shangguan said

31
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:57,480
Hope you can cherish this chance to remain intact.

32
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:00,200
We will announce that you committed suicide

33
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,400
for your father's death.

34
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:02,800
and leave a good name for generations.

35
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,960
What if I refuse?

36
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,080
Humph.

37
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,680
You will obey.

38
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:10,120
We will let you do it.

39
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:10,920
How dare you!

40
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,720
Princess, get changed and let's go.

41
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:36,160
Your Highness.

42
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,320
You're welcome, General Wang.

43
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:38,480
Don't delay recovery.

44
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,040
It's very dangerous this time.

45
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,600
Thank you for saving my life, Your Highness.

46
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,240
Don't mention it, General Wang.

47
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,600
Since Shangguan has killed us,

48
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,840
why don't we play along?

49
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,880
I have prepared a fake body

50
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:57,079
and pretended to be you.

51
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:59,400
and make Shangguan think they have succeeded.

52
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,160
When General Wang has recovered,

53
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,720
I have an important task for you.

54
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,840
Yes, Your Highness.

55
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:15,480
Princess.

56
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,720
I have transferred the guards at the east gate.

57
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,200
We only have 15 minutes.

58
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:19,920
Go now.

59
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:20,920
I'll cover you.

60
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:28,400
The princess will go east after departing.

61
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,920
Dong Mo Chen will pick you up at the inn.

62
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,760
Why are you in such a hurry?

63
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:35,480
This is not the way to treat guests.

64
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,159
My good subordinate.

65
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:39,800
Phoenix.

66
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,360
Your Highness.

67
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,840
There is a way to die less painful.

68
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:52,200
but you insisted on taking the hard way.

69
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,920
How dare a woman dream of becoming the emperor?

70
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,680
How ridiculous.

71
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,760
Shangguan Jingmo

72
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,560
You're the pitiful one.

73
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,280
From beginning to end,

74
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,280
you've been living in your narrow world.

75
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:09,080
You're so narrow that you only dream of becoming an emperor.

76
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,560
You could kill me today,

77
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,440
But I didn't expect

78
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:18,000
will eventually stab you.

79
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:21,480
You will never escape from your nightmare.

80
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,400
Shut up!

81
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,920
You're a demon full of nonsense.

82
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,920
I'll kill you today!

83
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:28,840
Wait.

84
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,320
Shangguan bastard!

85
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:45,440
Today, I will avenge the 5,000 soldiers!

86
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,640
Guards! Arrest them!

87
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,280
Guards!

88
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,840
Send General Chu for help.

89
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,800
What General Chu?

90
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:27,680
Are you referring to this person?

91
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,640
How is that possible?

92
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:34,159
I'm the master of this world.

93
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,080
How could I be

94
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:48,800
Gold Butrade.

95
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:51,080
Jin Butrade.

96
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:54,800
Princess.

97
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,400
Zuo Qianchen.

98
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,680
Can you hear me?

99
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:23,520
It's not up to you.

100
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,920
I'm the real author of the comic.

101
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,600
You are...

102
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:31,320
Wang Mao

103
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,040
Ye Ru Yi.

104
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:35,960
You really don't like

105
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:37,560
the character I created.

106
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,280
[Shangguan Kyung-mo]

107
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,320
A brainless golden finger

108
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,200
Unbelievable stories.

109
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,400
No one will like it.

110
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,440
So what?

111
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,440
They have their own ideas now.

112
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:50,400
and their own ideas.

113
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,800
and no longer be controlled by you.

114
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,720
They are more like a person than you.

115
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,800
I am the God of Creation.

116
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,159
You brainless ants!

117
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,840
I'll kill you all!

118
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,200
All of you will die.

119
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,240
Humph.

120
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,280
Do you see it?

121
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,560
You ants.

122
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:27,200
can only live under the rules I set.

123
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,440
Zuo Qianchen.

124
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:29,640
Zuo Qianchen!

125
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:43,320
Zuo Qianchen!

126
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:53,760
Zuo Qianchen.

127
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:56,360
Ruyi.

128
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I... I will protect you forever.

129
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:02,840
Don't scare me.

130
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:10,120
Since you like bitter scenes so much,

131
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,080
then today,

132
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:13,760
I'll give you another chance.

133
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:52,880
What is this place?

134
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:58,360
This is where the final chapter of this comic is.

135
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:00,120
Then...

136
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:01,880
if I destroy this place,

137
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:02,920
if I destroy this place?

138
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:06,640
Please choose this function carefully.

139
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,120
Once you choose,

140
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:11,000
Wang Mao World will return to its original state.

141
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:14,120
You can't enter the world again after you quit.

142
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,480
What about them?

143
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:19,840
You mean the NPCs?

144
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,480
They're not NPC.

145
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,120
They're my friends.

146
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,240
If you quit,

147
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:49,320
there's no previous file.

148
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:53,000
They will always be NPC in the original story.

149
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,600
That means it's not the right time.

150
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,080
I need to go back.

151
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,400
The world is finally

152
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:04,360
my most admired brother Shangguan.

153
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:06,960
Thank you.

154
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:11,920
Who is this woman?

155
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:12,880
I don't know her.

156
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,480
I told you

157
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,280
Lady Liu can't sit still.

158
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,600
She only has one son.

159
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:19,680
He's ignorant.

160
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:20,640
and disregarded human lives.

161
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:21,640
He's not worthy to be trusted.

162
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:22,800
Who drew this?

163
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,880
He's much more handsome in person than in the picture.

164
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,480
Who are you?

165
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,200
Why are you speaking for the Liu family?

166
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,000
I...

167
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:32,760
Are you trying to rebel?

168
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,240
Call the police.

169
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,400
Step aside.

170
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,120
Phoenix.

171
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,000
Under the Emperor,

172
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:43,000
Don't make a scene.

173
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,520
Read the notice.

174
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:46,920
If you cause trouble,

175
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,280
I won't let anyone off.

176
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:50,560
Let's go.

177
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:51,360
Zhu...

178
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,240
Wang Mao.

179
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,680
Is this your trick?

180
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,720
There must be something he can't interfere with.

181
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:09,560
Unknowledgeable.

182
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:20,800
Dongxia Chen.

183
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,240
You... You didn't lose your memory.

184
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:26,400
and not formatted.

185
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,520
You still remember me?

186
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:29,240
Ruyi.

187
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:30,760
I remember everything.

188
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:34,120
I thought it was just a dream.

189
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,520
Now I lost all my martial arts.

190
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:37,880
I can't find His Highness anymore.

191
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:38,840
It’s not like that.

192
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,320
This is not a dream.

193
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,320
I have the same memory as you.

194
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:44,720
This is what we have experienced.

195
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:46,800
I know.

196
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:50,520
Shangguan must not know your existence.

197
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:52,280
So you're not formatted.

198
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,240
It's a bit complicated.

199
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:59,320
But don't worry.

200
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,400
I'll definitely restore everything.

201
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:03,920
Anyway,

202
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:05,880
take a good rest today.

203
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:08,240
For now,

204
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:10,960
Shangguan just wants the story

205
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,760
to follow the original story.

206
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:17,200
Let's start with the unknown tomorrow.

207
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:20,280
Yes.
