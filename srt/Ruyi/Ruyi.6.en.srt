1
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:41,120
Say it.

2
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,120
Say it! Say it!

3
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:46,040
Listen to him.

4
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:50,440
The number one scholar of the dynasty cannot be changed.

5
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:53,920
is a rare rainbow star.

6
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:57,440
I heard he's the only one who can change the current situation.

7
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:59,360
and save the people.

8
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:02,040
Is that true?

9
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:03,160
Yes.

10
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:05,519
The fortune of the Number One Scholar can be verified.

11
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:06,400
That's great.

12
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:07,360
With the Number One Scholar,

13
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,480
will we be able to live a good life in the future?

14
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:10,440
Yes.

15
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,840
That's right.

16
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,240
But there's one thing.

17
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,440
What is it?

18
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:19,400
You can't get married within ten years.

19
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:21,039
Otherwise, it will affect the fate of the country.

20
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,200
Nonsense.

21
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:26,760
How can you show up like that?

22
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:29,880
This is ridiculous.

23
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:33,960
The people are making a scene.

24
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:35,479
and even wrote a joint letter.

25
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:38,680
The princess can only order to respect the people

26
00:01:39,039 --> 00:01:40,039
to postpone the wedding date.

27
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:44,080
There must be something wrong.

28
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,200
Investigate it.

29
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:47,440
Yes.

30
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:56,880
Useless!

31
00:01:57,479 --> 00:01:59,120
Is it so hard for you to kill someone?

32
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:04,760
Ye Ru Yi and Zuo Qianchen can't stay anymore.

33
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,600
Take it. If you fail,

34
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:12,040
you're on your own.

35
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:21,680
Yes.

36
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,560
Miss Ye is really smart.

37
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,920
She came up with such a good idea

38
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,320
to solve the problem.

39
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,680
Here, a toast to Miss Ye.

40
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,200
I'm embarrassed to be praised by Cang He.

41
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,120
Actually,

42
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,440
this time.

43
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,360
Everyone is great.

44
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,560
So let's do it together.

45
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:39,040
This is what we should do.

46
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,079
To celebrate the failure of Shangguan’s plan.

47
00:02:42,079 --> 00:02:44,440
To celebrate the failure of Shangguan’s plan.

48
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:00,960
Thank you.

49
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:04,360
so that she doesn't have to marry someone she doesn't like.

50
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,840
Why are you thanking me?

51
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:09,040
Zuo Qianchen hasn't thanked me yet.

52
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:13,320
Do you really like the princess?

53
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:18,160
Why do you care so much about Zuo Qianchen and Princess?

54
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,400
What about you? Who do you care about?

55
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:23,960
I just think

56
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:29,720
a marriage between two people who don't love will never be happy.

57
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:34,160
Just like your marriage.

58
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:35,440
Yes.

59
00:03:36,079 --> 00:03:38,160
I somehow married someone

60
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,840
someone I don't even know.

61
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,280
I never thought

62
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:43,760
this would happen to me.

63
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,280
He's really bad.

64
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:51,120
He tried to take me away last time when he came here.

65
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,440
And...

66
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,120
you don't care about your own sister.

67
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,680
He's not responsible at all.

68
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,840
Maybe he's not a bad person.

69
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,680
Are you speaking for him?

70
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,360
Do you remember when you were poisoned,

71
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,440
when you were poisoned?

72
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,080
Yes.

73
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:18,959
I'm a grateful person.

74
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,000
I'll find a way to thank him.

75
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,760
My wife is happy. The rice is in the bowl.

76
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,400
I have an appointment with a beauty. Don't disturb me.

77
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,920
You are so romantic.

78
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:19,000
You have a conscience. You still keep food for me.

79
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:24,080
Is it poisonous?

80
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,320
I was trying to repay you,

81
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,240
but you want to kill me.

82
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,400
I'd better go find the Master Ear.

83
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,800
There are so many people who want to kill me.

84
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,240
Can you protect me?

85
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:38,000
I found poison

86
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,120
in the buns Zuo Qianchen gave me.

87
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:45,000
Is there any misunderstanding?

88
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:46,880
Never mind.

89
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:48,640
I'll just die.

90
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,320
I can

91
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,200
a new round.

92
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:54,600
Yeah.

93
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,320
Die if you want.

94
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,080
When will I die?

95
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,960
You're young.

96
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,760
at such a young age?

97
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,040
Let me tell you.

98
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,840
You can't die.

99
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,640
We must defeat those bad guys together.

100
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:22,720
One-Ear Hero.

101
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,280
Okay, come down first.

102
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,680
Speak of

103
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,400
to

104
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,040
If Zuo Qianchen wants to kill you,

105
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,159
you can stay here.

106
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:47,880
Okay.

107
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,120
I will help you get out.

108
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,120
Your Highness.

109
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,640
Your Majesty, what is your plan?

110
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:05,120
Is the body ready?

111
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:05,920
Yes.

112
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,679
Although he is not valuable,

113
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,919
he's still my only brother.

114
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:37,559
No.

115
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,640
What do you think I should do in the future?

116
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:42,720
Princess.

117
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,039
I'm sorry for your loss.

118
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,280
Don't be too sad.

119
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,280
Anyway,

120
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:49,880
I'm by your side.

121
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:51,720
No.

122
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,800
Leave me alone.

123
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,120
No.

124
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:25,280
How is the princess?

125
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,040
No.

126
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:40,600
Father.

127
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,000
I've calmed him down.

128
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:46,400
I'm tired.

129
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:47,640
Excuse me.

130
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:57,360
One ear.

131
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:59,080
We were burned to death.

132
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,400
Did you do it?

133
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,200
Killing him is my plan.

134
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,480
Why did you kill him?

135
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,560
To help you escape.

136
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,840
Aren't you afraid that if you kill him, someone will pay with your life?

137
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,880
He deserves to die.

138
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:13,640
Really?

139
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,080
Your Highness. Your Highness.
