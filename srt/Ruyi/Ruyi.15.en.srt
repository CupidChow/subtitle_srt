1
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:46,120
It's here.

2
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:48,080
Ruyi, what's wrong?

3
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:49,600
Feeling better?

4
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:50,480
I'm fine.

5
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,040
Isn't there any good news?

6
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:59,440
I heard that the executioner is Kim Butrade.

7
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,040
I'm not sure if this is good news.

8
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,519
Knowing someone is better than strangers.

9
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:07,680
We know what he wants.

10
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:09,240
Ruyi.

11
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:12,640
He wants you.

12
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:15,160
Cang He,

13
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,720
Go ask about the prison in Qiao County.

14
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:20,039
Okay.

15
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,280
Don't worry.

16
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:24,840
Hey, Ruyi.

17
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:26,920
Don't be silly.

18
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:57,759
You are...

19
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:03,960
Have a seat.

20
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:11,680
Ruyi.

21
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,000
Did he tell you what happened back then?

22
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,200
He always fights with himself.

23
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:22,840
Back then, everyone had a chance to break out of the encirclement.

24
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,320
But the wrong information

25
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:28,440
which made him believe there must be reinforcements.

26
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:32,760
He planned to cooperate with the reinforcements

27
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,040
with the reinforcements.

28
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,400
But they spent a whole month

29
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,040
for a whole month.

30
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,640
We lost all the provisions.

31
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:43,640
Many soldiers died on the battlefield

32
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,640
but froze to death.

33
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,720
He starved to death in his camp.

34
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:52,560
The soldiers held his hand before they died and told him

35
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,200
This death is so frustrating.

36
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,360
Later, he realized the information was wrong,

37
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,760
he led a team of elites to break out.

38
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,240
But when they left,

39
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,280
the enemy started attacking.

40
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,120
The soldiers in the camp

41
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:12,760
They didn't even have a chance to fight back.

42
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,280
without even a chance to resist.

43
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:20,320
He thought he was a deserter.

44
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:24,920
After that,

45
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:28,240
he became an unknown ear.

46
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,920
That's how we established our own intelligence network.

47
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,800
Do you know Lion Guard?

48
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:38,760
Are they reliable?

49
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:41,720
All these years,

50
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,360
no one knows what they think.

51
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:49,200
Even when they fought so badly back then,

52
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,040
they never showed up.

53
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,840
As long as there is a glimmer of hope,

54
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,400
we have to give it a try.

55
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,920
I'll go with you.

56
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:57,720
No.

57
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,440
Once you leave,

58
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:02,520
Shangguan Jingmao can come in anytime.

59
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,800
I'll go with Zuo Qianchen.

60
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:11,200
Don't worry. I have a way to save him.

61
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,720
Ruyi, don't do anything stupid.

62
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,440
No.

63
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,920
Why are you in such a hurry to go out?

64
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:37,000
Father, I'm ordered to supervise Zuo Qianchen's execution.

65
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,040
You finally understand.

66
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,000
Take this badge.

67
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,920
Qiao County will be at your disposal.

68
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,240
Remember,

69
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:52,600
you must get rid of Zuo Qianchen.

70
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:07,800
I thought you knew Jin Bubei betrayed us.

71
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:12,200
Some old men in the court are supporting the Liu family.

72
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,360
They are locked up in prison.

73
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:18,120
I don't know when they will be executed.

74
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:21,040
Why don't we release them?

75
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,480
Isn't it easier to do it?

76
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,400
Tell your men to keep an eye on them.

77
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:31,200
Kill them all if there's a chance.

78
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:32,320
Okay.

79
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:55,080
You're here. Did I get you involved?

80
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,520
Stay still if you want to live.

81
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,160
It's all my fault.

82
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:02,800
Take care of yourself.

83
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,600
Don't flatter yourself.

84
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,200
It's not for you.

85
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,240
I'm doing it for the princess.

86
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:13,920
Hurry up.

87
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:14,760
Time's up.

88
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,360
Give this to the guards.

89
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:25,920
Don't make things difficult for you.

90
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,000
Ruyi.

91
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,760
I have nothing else to do today.

92
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:12,080
I just want to buy you a bottle of wine.

93
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:46,760
Zuo Qianchen.

94
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,600
If Ruyi hadn't come to me,

95
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,360
do you think I want to control you?

96
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:52,480
She came to you?

97
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:53,920
She's here. She's here.

98
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,159
She asked me to save you.

99
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:57,840
You don't know her yet.

100
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,880
She won't beg you for my help.

101
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,840
You don't know her well enough.

102
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:07,600
She has signed our marriage contract.

103
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,720
Take this wine as a wedding banquet.

104
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:19,640
Ruyi has always been mine.

105
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,680
It has always been mine.

106
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,360
Come on.

107
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:31,120
Come on.

108
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:52,560
You're here

109
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,960
Let's talk about it later.

110
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:55,800
Let's go.

111
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,040
Bad news, my lord.

112
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,160
My lord, bad news!

113
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,520
My lord, bad news!

114
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:07,800
Zuo Qianchen has become an immortal.

115
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:08,640
and ascended.

116
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:09,240
What?

117
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:10,560
This...
