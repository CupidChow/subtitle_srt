1
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:48,560
This Crown Prince is the only one

2
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:51,320
was the only time he led the army to battle.

3
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:55,360
causing 5,000 soldiers to die in vain.

4
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:59,160
Now the old emperor wants him to ascend the throne.

5
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,160
It's ridiculous.

6
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:05,080
After the Crown Prince took the Hehuan Powder,

7
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:08,920
Ruyi, you lie down.

8
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:16,520
I'm sorry.

9
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:17,400
Your Highness.

10
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,000
The candle is out as signal.

11
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,080
If we don't change upstairs,

12
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,200
and sue him for abduction.

13
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,840
Ruyi.

14
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,079
Your tricks are getting worse.

15
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,360
Your Highness.

16
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:47,000
Let's see how long you can be arrogant.

17
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:52,200
The Crown Prince, Qianchen, has committed a crime of disrespect.

18
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,760
He shall be dethroned as a commoner.

19
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,240
and exiled to a foreign country.

20
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,520
and reflect on himself.

21
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,200
Is this a place for people to live?

22
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,640
Zuo Qianchen,

23
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:40,240
You must marry my daughter Ye Ru Yi.

24
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,040
Shangguan Jingmao.

25
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,880
I'm not the Crown Prince anymore.

26
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:50,920
What else do you want me to do?

27
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,400
You've defiled my daughter's innocence.

28
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,120
Are you going to deny it?

29
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,760
I have to marry her, right?

30
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:06,560
You'll regret it.

31
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:19,600
Why should Ye Ru Yi

32
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,839
be the puppet that will be slaughtered by others

33
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:24,000
and be controlled by Shangguan.

34
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:25,680
If I were her,

35
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,360
Ah.

36
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,480
Where am I?

37
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,159
Time-slip!

38
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,480
Could it be...

39
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,920
This is so exciting.

40
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,640
Welcome to the world of comics.

41
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:53,320
Your current identity is Ye Ru Yi.

42
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:55,440
Your mission is to change her fate

43
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,360
and get rid of your foster father's control.

44
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,040
and help the princess seize power.

45
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,120
Today is your wedding.

46
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,520
But someone wants to kill you.

47
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:04,280
Run for your life.

48
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:06,280
I'm off work. No, no, no. Bye.

49
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:07,360
Hey.

50
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,560
If it wasn't me, why would I be killed?

51
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,080
You...

52
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,800
Are you really off work?

53
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:17,400
You don't even want to work overtime for a minute, do you?

54
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:40,480
Who wants to kill me?

55
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,920
It was my husband who wanted to kill me.

56
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,840
The intelligence center of Daliang

57
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:26,120
This is the one who covered the bar.

58
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,160
Unknown

59
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:39,120
Rumor has it that the owner called One Ear

60
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,240
He always wears a mask.

61
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:44,200
No one knows his real identity.

62
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:49,240
Ye Ru Yi was hunted down while running away from marriage.

63
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:14,120
Sir, the hot water is ready.

64
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,880
What are you doing?

65
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,280
Get lost!

66
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,159
Buddy, keep quiet.

67
00:07:37,159 --> 00:07:39,880
I mean no harm. Someone is after me.

68
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:42,040
Help me get rid of them.

69
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,920
Are you threatening me or begging me?

70
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,440
Hide for me.

71
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,600
I'll be useful to you.

72
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:53,680
Ye Ru Yi.

73
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,960
You threw yourself into my arms

74
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,400
and your foster father set me up.

75
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,080
I escaped the marriage on purpose.

76
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,960
Let's see

77
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,960
your new trick today.

78
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,440
What are you doing?

79
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:11,840
Help you.

80
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:26,960
Sir,

81
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:30,440
It's not a place to be polite.

82
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:32,200
But I don't like it

83
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,799
I don't like it.

84
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:37,440
I suspect the witch I'm looking for is hiding here.

85
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:40,000
Witch, I don't have it.

86
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,840
I do have one.

87
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,280
You're pestering me.

88
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,000
Are you trying to ruin my plan

89
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:51,200
or do you want to be with us?

90
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:52,880
Who?

91
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:14,520
I didn't expect Shangguan to control you too.

92
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:18,160
Do you think I should save your life

93
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,320
or let you die?

94
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,720
Honey.
