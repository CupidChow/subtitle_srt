1
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:41,320
Guards!

2
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:51,040
Someone reported that he didn't know about gambling.

3
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:53,960
Therefore, Nanfeng Pavilion is more unscrupulous.

4
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:57,200
I'm here to seal it.

5
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:57,840
Nonsense.

6
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,320
Nanfeng Pavilion has never had any dirty activities.

7
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:01,840
Have you found any evidence?

8
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:03,080
Ruyi.

9
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:04,879
It depends on you. It depends on you.

10
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:06,040
depends on you.

11
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,440
It's between you and me.

12
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:09,000
between you and me?

13
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:12,800
It's just some unimportant people.

14
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:14,680
You must

15
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:17,200
come with me.

16
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:31,920
If you leave,

17
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:33,400
what should we do?

18
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,960
Unknown people are illegally running it.

19
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,000
The evidence is solid.

20
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:41,600
Smash it!

21
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:43,640
Stop!

22
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,200
I'll go with you.

23
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,280
Let them go.

24
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:53,800
Ruyi.

25
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,560
They're still useful.

26
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,120
We can't be smashed by them.

27
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:02,880
Don't worry.

28
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:05,360
He won't do anything to me.

29
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,280
Don't you understand?

30
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,759
She said she's coming with me.

31
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:46,480
Your Highness.

32
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,640
How can you let Miss Ye Ruyi go with Jin Buyi?

33
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,440
You know who Ye Ru Yi is.

34
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,480
No one can change her mind.

35
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:56,200
But...

36
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:57,600
It's okay.

37
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,000
Tell the princess

38
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,920
Find an excuse to get Jin out of the capital.

39
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:01,760
Yes.

40
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,440
But after this

41
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,400
the guests won't dare to come again

42
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:09,760
Then do something

43
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,480
to restore the unknown place as soon as possible.

44
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,000
That way, we can collect information.

45
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,040
Also,

46
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:16,079
make more money.

47
00:03:16,079 --> 00:03:17,400
The provisions at the border are in danger.

48
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,079
Yes.

49
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,040
I don't know

50
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,880
I don't know what happened.

51
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:41,160
Is it so painful to be with me?

52
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,120
Ruyi, I have something to do in the court.

53
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,480
I'll be back later.

54
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:27,480
What do you think?

55
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,640
Do you think my idea works?

56
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:31,600
The manager said we can try.

57
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:32,720
That's good.

58
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:35,159
Are you ready for the divination wine?

59
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,720
Yes.

60
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,440
Do you need to pick an auspicious day?

61
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,480
No, it's better to pick another day.

62
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,320
Just today.

63
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:45,960
Wait for me.

64
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,480
Take a look.

65
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,400
A new Fortune-telling wine

66
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,600
Come and take a look.

67
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,120
Sir.

68
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,200
Okay.

69
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:00,920
This is our new divination wine.

70
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,920
What new stuff is coming out?

71
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,400
This is Fortune-telling Wine.

72
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:09,040
There's a spirit stick in each pot.

73
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:11,920
You can see it after you drink it.

74
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,200
Bring me a pot when you're in trouble.

75
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,160
I promise everything will go well.

76
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,240
It works.

77
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,480
How much is this pot?

78
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,200
Let me try.

79
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,120
to see if it works.

80
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,480
Ruyi, the manager said it's dangerous outside.

81
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,000
Why don't we go back first?

82
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:52,000
Sir, what's wrong?

83
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,560
Do you not like the food?

84
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,440
No, no.

85
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:55,440
It suits your taste.

86
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,920
I came here today

87
00:05:58,840 --> 00:05:59,840
to

88
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,360
I want to

89
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:03,760
with Mr. Qian.

90
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,000
You must be joking, sir.

91
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,640
I'm just a woman.

92
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,200
I need men to decide my business.

93
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,360
Why don't you go to my father?

94
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,720
Business is not physical work.

95
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,720
There's no difference between men and women.

96
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,520
What's the difference?

97
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,120
Thank you for not despising me as a woman.

98
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,000
Just say it.

99
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,200
Here's the thing.

100
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:28,120
We don't know

101
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:30,280
Something happened recently.

102
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,440
The food is decreasing.

103
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:32,880
However,

104
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,960
we launched a new wine.

105
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,080
called Fortune-telling Wine.

106
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,040
It's been sold for a few days.

107
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,040
It worked well.

108
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,240
I'm impressed.

109
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:41,480
I was wondering

110
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,920
to sell the wine

111
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:46,840
to sell it?

112
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:48,600
Of course.

113
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,280
You look like a businessman.

114
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,000
Don't be modest.

115
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:52,520
Okay.

116
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,040
Let me pour you another cup.

117
00:06:58,960 --> 00:06:59,800
It's getting late.

118
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,040
Why don't we go back first?

119
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,280
Okay.

120
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:05,920
How about this, Miss Qian?

121
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,120
Next time,

122
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,080
We'll have a good drink next time.

123
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:09,680
Okay.

124
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,480
I'm leaving.

125
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,120
How are you?

126
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,680
I'm fine.

127
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,480
He didn't give me a hard time.

128
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,480
I wonder how he is doing.

129
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:58,440
Thanks to your Fortune-telling Wine, we got in.

130
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,680
That's good.

131
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:01,840
By the way,

132
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,120
the military pay hasn't been settled yet, right?

133
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,760
It doesn't matter. I'll think about it.

134
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,720
Jin Buswaang will be sent out for a while.

135
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,240
So please bear with it for a while.

136
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:24,600
I know how to make money.

137
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:28,200
Don't look at me like that.

138
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,080
He'll be back soon.

139
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,520
Let's go.

140
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,640
I'm leaving.

141
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:43,559
Let go of me.

142
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,920
If Jin Bubei sees it,

143
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,400
I don't know what will happen.

144
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,920
You are my wife.

145
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,880
Why do you have private meetings every day?

146
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,080
What private meeting?

147
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,240
Don't be so harsh.
