1
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:51,640
Why are you laughing?

2
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,120
Is it weird?

3
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,080
I'm laughing.

4
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,680
I've never seen such a pretty servant.

5
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:09,039
Are you jealous that I'm more handsome than you?

6
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:14,920
What are you doing?

7
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:15,720
Don't move.

8
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:21,720
It's just a show. We need a full set.

9
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:31,760
Let's go, Young Master.

10
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,080
The mask is pretty.

11
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:54,880
Do you like it?

12
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:57,200
This is so ugly.

13
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,039
Thank you.

14
00:01:59,039 --> 00:01:59,840
Take a look.

15
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:04,800
This is cute.

16
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,960
Miss, this mask suits you.

17
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:09,080
Really?

18
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,320
Do I look good?

19
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,000
Not bad.

20
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:22,800
This...

21
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,200
It suits you so well.

22
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,280
Change the mask on your face.

23
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,079
Change it to this.

24
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,160
Which one do you want?

25
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Boss, I want this.

26
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,360
Thank you.

27
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:17,720
I want chestnuts.

28
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,240
Let me peel them for you.

29
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:02,640
Ruo.

30
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,680
Don’t go there. It’s a trap.

31
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,520
It’s really Ruo.

32
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,279
She’s not dead.

33
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,800
Take her back to her place.

34
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,720
Have you forgotten how she hurt you?

35
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,200
She didn’t do it willingly.

36
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,160
Ruo.

37
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:27,760
Ruo.

38
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,000
I...

39
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,520
I'm sorry.

40
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:33,840
Get up.

41
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,320
Zuo Qianchen.

42
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,080
You are so generous.

43
00:04:46,159 --> 00:04:47,200
Saving people is more important.

44
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:57,440
Young Master.

45
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,000
Take her back.

46
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,240
Yes.

47
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,320
Dongxia Chen.

48
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,640
How is she? Can she be saved?

49
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:31,640
It's easy to deal with skin injuries.

50
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:32,760
But

51
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,440
there is a lot of evil poison in her body.

52
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,400
It will affect her heart soon.

53
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,120
This is irreversible damage.

54
00:05:39,159 --> 00:05:41,440
Is there any solution?

55
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,159
Only the dragon bone can solve it.

56
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:47,920
But...

57
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:50,560
this medicine is very valuable.

58
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:54,720
I wonder what your plan is.

59
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,560
It's not me. I know you're worried that if we save her,

60
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,400
she will be a threat to us.

61
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:02,960
But think about it.

62
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,720
We saved her.

63
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:07,960
she won't make things difficult for us again, right?

64
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,400
And look at her.

65
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:15,440
She has no one to rely on.

66
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,520
What a pity.

67
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,120
Aren't you angry?

68
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,600
Why would I be angry?

69
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,440
She didn't do it willingly.

70
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:27,560
The medicine Dong Mo Chen mentioned is very expensive.

71
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:29,120
But it's not impossible to find it, right?

72
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:29,920
Yes.

73
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,440
Don't worry.

74
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:35,360
I'll pay for the medicine.

75
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,159
And I promise you

76
00:06:37,159 --> 00:06:38,760
I'll do my best.

77
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,000
What a loyal Ye Ru Yi!

78
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,920
You'd better

79
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,200
bear the consequences.

80
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,720
What are you angry about?

81
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:11,320
Nothing.

82
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,160
No.

83
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,960
Then why did you drink?

84
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,920
I'm just angry that you don't care about me.

85
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,960
I don't care about you.

86
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:27,280
Zuo Qianchen, do you have a conscience?

87
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,680
Do you think I saved Ruo because I’m a living Buddha?

88
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:33,280
I want Shangguan Jingmao who bullied you

89
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,120
to pay the price he deserves.

90
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:41,200
You mean

91
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,280
we need to lure the enemy deeper.

92
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,520
Looks like my husband is not that stupid.

93
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,440
Is she really okay?

94
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:05,040
I'm afraid Shangguan is severely punished.

95
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,160
Besides,

96
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,960
she didn't tell us when she ran away last time.

97
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,400
Go get the medicine.

98
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,280
Thank you, Young Master.

99
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,040
Hush.

100
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,200
Hush.

101
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:02,080
Keep quiet.

102
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,000
Don't talk.

103
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,400
Hush.

104
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:12,600
This is the antidote.

105
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,760
Give it to them when you go out.

106
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,080
So fast get up

107
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,080
Keep quiet.

108
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:21,920
Take them away.

109
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:22,760
Take them away!

110
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:23,480
Go!

111
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:33,880
Sorry to keep you waiting.
