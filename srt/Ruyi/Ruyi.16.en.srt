1
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:40,560
Where is he?

2
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:41,440
Where is he?

3
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:42,640
No way.

4
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:43,360
I don't know.

5
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:44,360
What's going on?

6
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,480
My lord.

7
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,240
He was right in front of me.

8
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:49,640
He suddenly glows.

9
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:50,480
What?

10
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,240
Then there was a smoke.

11
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,320
Zuo Qianchen also rose higher and higher with the smoke.

12
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,160
and higher.

13
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:56,040
With the smoke,

14
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:56,960
he was gone.

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:57,920
Nonsense!

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,120
Zuo Qianchen must have taken the chance to escape.

17
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:01,920
How dare he lie to you?

18
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,160
God,

19
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:04,840
How dare I say such a thing?

20
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:05,960
It's true.

21
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:06,720
My lord is here.

22
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:07,680
How dare you talk nonsense!

23
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:08,960
Enough. Shut up.

24
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:10,680
Let's call it a day.

25
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:12,120
Don't mention it again.

26
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,039
Yes, sir.

27
00:01:13,039 --> 00:01:13,560
Yes.

28
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:16,240
That's it.

29
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:17,120
Keep it quiet.

30
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,560
Tell Lord Shangguan

31
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,560
the culprit has been sent away as planned.

32
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,680
Don't cause any trouble.

33
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:22,120
Understand?

34
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:23,320
Your Excellency.

35
00:01:32,039 --> 00:01:33,400
Thank you for saving my life, Miss Ye.

36
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:34,520
Farewell.

37
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,200
The most important thing now is to find the Lion Guard.

38
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:39,080
We have to leave now.

39
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:45,479
It's difficult to find the Lion Guard.

40
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,080
You’d better stay out of it.

41
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:49,200
Zuo Qianchen, what’s wrong with you?

42
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,440
Let me ask you again.

43
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:51,960
Are you leaving or not?

44
00:01:55,039 --> 00:01:56,039
Let me tell you.

45
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,080
I like you.

46
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,360
I know you like me too.

47
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,120
Otherwise, your heart will beat like thunder.

48
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:06,920
Why?

49
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,360
I... I didn't.

50
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:13,240
Is it so hard to admit that you care about me?

51
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,560
I know you're worried about me.

52
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:18,079
But can you care about my feelings?

53
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,880
You said that to him too, right?

54
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:27,840
Who?

55
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:33,079
Jin Butrade said you like him.

56
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,640
You must be jealous.

57
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,120
This is the map of Lion Guard.

58
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,800
and the money I've saved up recently.

59
00:02:48,079 --> 00:02:49,280
You want to part with me?

60
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,079
Sure.

61
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,320
But I'll keep my promise to you.

62
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,360
I will do it.

63
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:33,400
How can I get out of this place?

64
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,800
I wish I had copied it more carefully.

65
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,480
Zuo Qianchen.

66
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,240
Ruyi.

67
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,000
I'm hitting you.

68
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:01,760
Why do you always quarrel?

69
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,160
You didn't stop me when I was leaving.

70
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:05,360
Do you know how scary it was in the forest?

71
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,320
Go back before dawn.

72
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,159
You know.

73
00:04:32,159 --> 00:04:34,000
I won't give up until the end.

74
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:52,640
Zuo Qianchen.

75
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,200
I gave you money to find the Lion Guard.

76
00:04:58,159 --> 00:04:59,280
You're getting married.

77
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,000
I have to give you a gift.

78
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,720
What do you mean?

79
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,400
I saw the wedding letter.

80
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:10,880
This is for you.

81
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:14,760
Zuo Qianchen.

82
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,640
You are the biggest nerd in the world.

83
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:21,720
Idiot.

84
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,320
You and I were controlled by Shangguan Jingmao.

85
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:34,159
You should know

86
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,520
he was the one who started this,

87
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,360
instead of Zuo Qianchen.

88
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:42,040
Does it matter?

89
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:46,080
You came to us to deal with Shangguan Jingmao.

90
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,800
I thought

91
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,520
we had the same goal.

92
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,000
Ruyi.

93
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,120
Marry me.

94
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,240
I will try to save his life.

95
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,840
I can't give you anything except money.

96
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:07,960
This time,

97
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:14,360
please help me.

98
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,520
He tricked you and you believed him?

99
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,440
No.

100
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,560
I'm not.

101
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,320
At that time, I...

102
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,560
So in your heart,

103
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:43,360
I, Ye Ru Yi,

104
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,480
who can exchange myself

105
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,240
to achieve something, right?

106
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,040
No, no, no.

107
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:50,400
I was too impatient.

108
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,400
So the marriage letter was fake.

109
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:02,880
What do you think?

110
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:10,720
Listen.

111
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:15,200
Don't ever say

112
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,840
break up again.

113
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:54,720
Ruyi.

114
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,200
This is Bogu.

115
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:28,160
Don't be sad. I'm here.

116
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,120
You don't know what I messed up in the past.

117
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:33,919
I ruined everything.

118
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:35,799
It's all in the past.

119
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:37,000
There's no past.

120
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,520
Five thousand souls

121
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,799
Every night in front of my window

122
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,920
in front of my window every night.

123
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:46,520
You know?

124
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,280
My brothers are here.

125
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,760
Senior, comrades.

126
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,640
They didn't even close their eyes when they died.

127
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,320
Broken arms.

128
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,320
Blood is everywhere on the battlefield.

129
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,200
The failure of the battle

130
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,960
It's not just your fault.

131
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,680
You were only 20 then.

132
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,200
No.

133
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,080
If it weren't for my stubbornness,

134
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:13,880
or

135
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,200
I changed my plan.

136
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:20,040
would the result be different?

137
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,480
I was too arrogant.

138
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,320
They died because of me.

139
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,920
I should have given my life to them.

140
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,360
I'm so tired living every day.

141
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,920
I spent it in endless regret.

142
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:38,080
I face the humiliation of the world

143
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:40,360
and humiliation.

144
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,880
I'm just a piece of mud.

145
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,680
Anyone can step on me.

146
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,200
But...

147
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,120
I deserve to die.

148
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,720
The one who really killed those 5,000 soldiers

149
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:02,360
would think they were wrong?

150
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,280
They should be the ones suffering.

151
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,120
Not you.

152
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,760
It seems that our soft-hearted Warrior One Ear

153
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:12,120
is really not suitable to be the Crown Prince.

154
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,080
Is that comforting?

155
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:23,320
Don't worry.

156
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:26,480
We will find a way to avenge them.

157
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:32,560
Look.

158
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,480
Where should we go?

159
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,080
This way?

160
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,000
The same way.

161
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:11,080
I'm tired.

162
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,240
Yeah

163
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,960
Did we come here just now?

164
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:19,840
Come this way.

165
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,040
Let's go straight.

166
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:31,760
Go.

167
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:35,760
Tell me.

168
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:39,160
Why have we been circling in the bamboo forest?

169
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,600
Could it be the legendary ghost?

170
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,200
Something is fishy.

171
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,560
Let's take a rest here.

172
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:46,400
Let's continue.

173
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,040
Waiter, is the meal ready?

174
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:50,840
Yes.

175
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:12,920
Hey.

176
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:16,320
Yes.

177
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:19,600
Try one.

178
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,200
So,

179
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:30,760
get through this bamboo forest?

180
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,680
Lion constellations don't go out usually, right?

181
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:37,440
This should be a formation.

182
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,240
But we lack a way to break it.

183
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:40,640
Matrix?

184
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:44,080
Are you going to cross the bamboo forest?

185
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:45,920
Yes, sir.

186
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:51,560
We're looking for an old friend.

187
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,120
He lives at the end of the bamboo forest.

188
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:54,880
If you go there,

189
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:59,120
follow the white path.

190
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,280
It won't take long.

191
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:18,520
I see.

192
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:20,880
Let's go.
