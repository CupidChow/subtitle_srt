1
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:48,680
Ruyi, listen to me.

2
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,160
I didn't mean to hide it from you.

3
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,120
It's inconvenient for me to take care of the Crown Prince.

4
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:58,320
I don't want to lie to you.

5
00:00:58,840 --> 00:00:59,920
I understand.

6
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,640
I'm just a pawn

7
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:03,240
in your strategies.

8
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:04,319
Your Highness.

9
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:05,600
You don't have to tell me this.

10
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:06,680
I've had enough fun.

11
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:07,760
Can I go now?

12
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:09,560
Where are you going?

13
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,000
People are after you.

14
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,280
Mind your own business.

15
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,039
Who else?

16
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:15,320
You are my wife.

17
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,960
Do you think I want to marry you?

18
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:17,880
If it weren't for...

19
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:19,640
Because of what?

20
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:24,080
Who do you want to marry if you don't want to marry me?

21
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:26,560
Gold Butrade.

22
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:27,440
Yes.

23
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:30,680
Okay.

24
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:34,360
I'm sorry.

25
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,880
I broke you up.

26
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,160
Why are you still here?

27
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,320
I can't leave.

28
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,440
If I leave, you'll die.

29
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,000
you're going to get me into trouble.

30
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:44,840
Father.

31
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:49,160
I've buried my sister and Zuo Qianchen's bodies.

32
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,240
No.

33
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:59,800
You should focus on your marriage with the princess.

34
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,240
instead of these trivial matters.

35
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:03,960
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

36
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,520
About the rumor,

37
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,760
the rumor?

38
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,240
It’s related to the unknown.

39
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,760
It's just a rumor.

40
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:12,800
No evidence.

41
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:13,960
Okay.

42
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:15,960
Keep looking.

43
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:17,920
No.

44
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,680
Seal it.

45
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,200
Yes.

46
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:50,920
Ruyi.

47
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,720
You've mistaken me for someone else.

48
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,720
I won't mistake you for someone else.

49
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:02,720
I knew it wasn't you.

50
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,080
I let go before.

51
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,320
I won't let you go again.

52
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,440
What are you talking about?

53
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,960
Ruyi, don't be angry.

54
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,800
I know you don't want me to marry the princess.

55
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,480
I will break off the engagement with the princess.

56
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,480
Let's get married soon.

57
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,040
Stop it.

58
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,720
Ruyi, I won't let you leave me again.

59
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,680
We don't know each other well.

60
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,440
We grew up together.

61
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:27,800
Ruyi.

62
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:28,920
I...

63
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,600
Hush.

64
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:31,680
Lower your voice.

65
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,040
You know

66
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:35,080
I only have you in my heart.

67
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,320
Just come with me.

68
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,080
Hey.

69
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:37,840
It's not you.

70
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:40,080
Why can't you stop?

71
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:46,640
My landlady.

72
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,600
The restaurant is a mess.

73
00:04:49,159 --> 00:04:50,440
Where are you going?

74
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:07,680
Ruyi.

75
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,160
Who is he?

76
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,400
Be polite to our landlady

77
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:13,920
She said she won't go with you.

78
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:16,960
It's none of your business.

79
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:20,720
Ruyi, you must come with me today.

80
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:29,720
She doesn't want to leave.

81
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,520
No one can take her away.

82
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,600
You'll regret it.

83
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,080
Aren't you going to marry him?

84
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,120
Can't you tell?

85
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,120
I take every word you say seriously.

86
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,760
If you insist on leaving,

87
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:18,760
take this with you.

88
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:20,920
and protect yourself.

89
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,480
I suddenly don't want to leave.

90
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:49,320
Your Highness.

91
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,200
Jin Buswaang and his men are searching for him.

92
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,080
Miss Ye is confronting him.
