1
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:52,760
Come on.

2
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:54,960
I've been looking for you for a long time.

3
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,760
Why are you here?

4
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:58,880
I'm here to pick you up.

5
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,240
Let go!

6
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:07,240
What are you looking for?

7
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:09,200
Who is your wife?

8
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:11,680
You've only been married for a few days, and you're not recognizing me?

9
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,720
I don't know you.

10
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,520
You came to brothel as a newlywed.

11
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:15,360
and stayed out all night.

12
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,360
How inappropriate!

13
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:17,600
You just killed your wife.

14
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:18,920
Aren't you afraid of being struck by lightning?

15
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,000
Isn't that funny?

16
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:24,000
Don't make excuses.

17
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,480
Do you have a crush on a toy boy?

18
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,200
I can't live anymore.

19
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,440
Who wants to live with you?

20
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:31,000
I want to live a good life.

21
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:32,160
Stop it.

22
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:34,120
I'm not going with you.

23
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:38,360
It's only been a few days since we got married. Why do you dislike me so much?

24
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,240
So what?

25
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,640
I haven't hit you yet.

26
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:42,720
Humph!

27
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:44,320
Did you hear that?

28
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:46,160
She stayed out all night and wanted to hit me.

29
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:51,640
You're spreading rumours, aren't you?

30
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:57,800
My lord.

31
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,680
I, Ye Ru Yi, just hit someone.

32
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:00,840
Please investigate.

33
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,640
Lock me up in prison.

34
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,720
When did you hit someone?

35
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:05,600
No, my lord.

36
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,760
I just...

37
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,080
Don't talk about

38
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,360
in court.

39
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:11,000
My lord.

40
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,080
Please put me in jail.

41
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:14,520
It's all a misunderstanding.

42
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,560
Please forgive me.

43
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,600
Did she hit someone?

44
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,240
She did.

45
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:17,920
No.

46
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:19,640
Okay.

47
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,720
I didn't call him just now.

48
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:22,840
I'm...

49
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:24,960
Let go.

50
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,360
Can you stop it?

51
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,560
Can't we talk at home?

52
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:30,880
Who's going home with you?

53
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,000
I'll die if I go home.

54
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,600
Why would I kill you?

55
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,760
Then the one in the wedding dress

56
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:38,440
the one following me is a ghost.

57
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,360
Did you see his face?

58
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,000
You're the one who holds the sky down.

59
00:02:42,079 --> 00:02:43,680
Think about it.

60
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,920
Why should I kill you?

61
00:02:45,079 --> 00:02:46,800
You're the stupid one.

62
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,680
Enough!

63
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:50,640
You two are not allowed to mess around in court.

64
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,520
You want to go to jail?

65
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,320
I'll grant your wish.

66
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,320
Thank you, my lord.

67
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,520
I will go in and repent.

68
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:01,880
The most dangerous place is the safest place.

69
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:04,080
There's food and drinks in prison.

70
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,440
and protection.

71
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:11,480
My lord.

72
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:12,880
My lord, I'm sorry.

73
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,440
My wife was just trying to be quick.

74
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,040
Please forgive her.

75
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,760
I also want to plead for her.

76
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,120
You two are a loving couple.

77
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,960
Let's have a good conversation in prison.

78
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:25,079
Guards, put them in jail.

79
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,120
She's not dead.

80
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,120
Did she find the antidote?

81
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:33,040
I'll investigate it immediately.

82
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,680
and make it public.

83
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:44,520
This is not something Ye Ru Yi would do.

84
00:03:45,079 --> 00:03:46,360
On the day of the wedding assassination,

85
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,160
I felt something strange.

86
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:49,960
She hasn't changed.

87
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,520
but her behavior

88
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,360
is like a different person.

89
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:58,000
But this is not the reason why you let her make trouble.

90
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:03,520
Phoenix.

91
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,880
You’ve changed too.

92
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:10,720
I dare not betray you.

93
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,760
Then show me your level.

94
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,080
Don't let me down.

95
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,480
No matter what it takes,

96
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:23,800
to kill Ye Ru Yi.

97
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,280
Yes.

98
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:26,560
I understand.

99
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,560
Why are you so far away from me?

100
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:51,840
This is a prison.

101
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:52,760
What do you want?

102
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,400
I advise you

103
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,960
don't have any bad thoughts.

104
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:59,880
So many eyes are watching you.

105
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:02,000
You won't live even if I die.

106
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,880
Why do you have to say I want to kill you?

107
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,360
Hey.

108
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:18,720
You are a lady from Shangguan family.

109
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,320
You...

110
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:22,720
You don't like it?

111
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,760
Then you can divorce me.

112
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:27,760
I can't do that.

113
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,160
A newlywed divorce.

114
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,080
will be struck by lightning.

115
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,280
Moreover,

116
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,080
you haven't served me all day.

117
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,080
I don't want to.

118
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:36,040
Stop pretending, Zuo Qianchen.

119
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,200
Tell me.

120
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:40,520
How are you going to kill me?

121
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,440
Let me ask you again.

122
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,120
Why do you have to say I want to kill you?

123
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,920
Are you planning to poison me

124
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,600
and throw me into the well

125
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,120
or bury me in your backyard?

126
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,640
Shut up and sleep.

127
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,320
Princess,

128
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,480
The Crown Prince

129
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,040
is in prison

130
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,040
in the prison.

131
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,520
Is this a trap?

132
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:26,480
It seems Ye Ru Yi did it herself.

133
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,120
She thought the Crown Prince wanted to kill her.

134
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,520
so she hid in prison.

135
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,640
It has nothing to do with Shangguan.

136
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,920
This is a serious matter.

137
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,159
We need to solve it quickly.

138
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,480
Princess, what's your plan?

139
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:45,280
Let's wait and see.

140
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:48,840
Keep an eye on Shangguan Jingmao.

141
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,440
You secretly protect the Crown Prince.

142
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,040
Yo.

143
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,480
Are you awake?

144
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,280
It's lively tonight.

145
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,720
Snoring again

146
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:25,720
fart again

147
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:26,480
grinding teeth again.

148
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,560
You even talk in your sleep.

149
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,840
What are you talking about?

150
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,280
I never snore.

151
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,520
or sleep talk.

152
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:37,720
I said one, one, one.

153
00:07:38,159 --> 00:07:39,360
One ear.

154
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:40,720
One.

155
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,280
A bowl of ramen.

156
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:45,480
You must be hungry.

157
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,440
Of course.

158
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,720
I haven't eaten all day.

159
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,640
I'm starving.

160
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,800
Dinner is ready.

161
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:08,680
Thank you.

162
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,000
Don't you have hands?

163
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,360
Here.

164
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,720
Is the food poisonous?

165
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:27,360
Zuo Qianchen, how dare you steal the prison?

166
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,240
What are you doing?

167
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:37,559
Did you see that?

168
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:41,799
How?

169
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,360
Now?

170
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,480
Do you think this prison is safe?

171
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,240
But who else wants to kill me except you?

172
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,200
Why are you so sure that I wanted to kill you?

173
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:01,440
I didn't kill you at the wedding.

174
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,200
Brother.

175
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:05,800
I didn't see your face clearly that day.

176
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,320
But you were wearing a wedding dress.

177
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,480
You still want to quibble?

178
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,160
I'm weak.

179
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,160
Otherwise, I wouldn't have been slapped by you.

180
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:25,720
You really don't know martial arts?

181
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,320
Think about it.

182
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,680
I'm just a commoner now.

183
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:30,960
What's in it for me to kill you?

184
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:36,160
Let me sort it out for you.

185
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,480
Killing you is the first step.

186
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,800
and make others think I killed you.

187
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:41,840
Is it the second step?

188
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,480
This meal is obviously to send us away.

189
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,240
Who do you think this person is?

190
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,320
Shangguan Jingmo.

191
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,520
