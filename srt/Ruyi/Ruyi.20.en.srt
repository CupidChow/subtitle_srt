1
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:45,560
Hurry up! Hurry up! Hurry up!

2
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:51,440
Guards!

3
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:53,800
Someone!

4
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:04,239
Ye Ru Yi.

5
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,440
You're here.

6
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:09,240
It seems different from what you expected.

7
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:14,640
But what can you do on your own?

8
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:29,080
She's not alone.

9
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,280
She's just an ant.

10
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,320
No need to be afraid.

11
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:44,560
Who are you?

12
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:47,080
Cut the crap, Shangguan.

13
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,240
Go to hell!

14
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,039
Humph!

15
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:51,680
Do you think you can change anything

16
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:54,240
can change anything?

17
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:03,400
What if you add me?

18
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:05,440
Phoenix,

19
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,039
You’ve let me down for all these years.

20
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,320
Without you,

21
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,760
without you.

22
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,840
A dog that I don't know well.

23
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,520
It's fine to lose it.

24
00:02:29,079 --> 00:02:29,800
Dear.

25
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,800
Why are you here too?

26
00:02:33,079 --> 00:02:34,400
Traitor Shangguan Jingmo.

27
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,280
Still not repenting?

28
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,800
The Liu family's court

29
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:43,200
Who are you to speak?

30
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:46,440
Guards!

31
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,000
Arrest them all!

32
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:01,800
You are indeed my best son.

33
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:06,160
If I don't kill them,

34
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,960
You're the one who deserves to die.

35
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:19,920
You overestimate yourself.

36
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,000
Humph.

37
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:34,640
No!

38
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,079
Dongmo Chen.

39
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,120
Ruyi.

40
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,320
Don't give up.

41
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,480
Bye.

42
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,320
Thief Shangguan.

43
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,800
I'll kill you!

44
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,920
Max.

45
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,560
We will win.

46
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,040
Zuo Qianchen.

47
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:02,800
Zuo Qianchen.

48
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,200
Sorry.

49
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,040
I'm late.

50
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,000
Zuo Qianchen.

51
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:14,840
Ye Ru Yi.

52
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,280
Don't you understand?

53
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:20,160
I am the master of this world.

54
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:23,720
A nobody like you

55
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:26,640
should die in this world.

56
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,720
Shangguan Kyung-mo.

57
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:33,200
We are all small characters in your story.

58
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:35,159
in your story.

59
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,920
We don't have golden fingers.

60
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,880
We don't have the halo of the protagonist.

61
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,000
But I've told you.

62
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:50,280
no one wants to see you become the emperor.

63
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,280
No!

64
00:07:32,159 --> 00:07:35,040
Congratulations on passing through the blind boxes.

65
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,000
The comic has been modified successfully.

66
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,040
and returned to the real world successfully.

67
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,800
It's finally done.

68
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,080
The company is down.

69
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,480
Yes.

70
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:11,160
I heard that the boss is not capable.

71
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:13,200
plagiarized her assistant's work.

72
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,280
He was sued and lost a lot of money.

73
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,320
That's it?

74
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:18,960
This boss is too much.

75
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:21,000
It's fine that he deducts our salary,

76
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,640
but you bully little girls.

77
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:23,840
What kind of ability is that?

78
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,160
That's right.

79
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,880
I've seen her before.

80
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,360
She's very pretty.

81
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,160
Yes.

82
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:30,680
What's your name?

83
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,080
Yoo Shi-won.

84
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,200
That's right.

85
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,600
Are you Ye Ru Yi?

86
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,720
Can I buy you a cup of coffee?

87
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:02,960
Hello.

88
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:05,360
Enjoy.

89
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,840
Ye Ru Yi, you may not know me.

90
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:12,880
No.

91
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,840
I know you.

92
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:19,440
I know you are the real author of the God of War Sword.

93
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,160
Congratulations on winning Wang Mao.

94
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,000
Thank you.

95
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,880
Actually, I found you this time

96
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:26,200
because I read your popular comic.

97
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:26,920
I don't know.

98
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:29,160
are you interested in joining our studio?

99
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:29,920
Yes.

100
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:30,760
They're here.

101
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:31,600
Hi.

102
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:34,920
Let me introduce you briefly.

103
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:37,000
More money is our boss.

104
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:40,280
His boyfriend Cang He is our marketing manager.

105
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,040
This is Phoenix.

106
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:43,640
our operating director.

107
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,320
His fiance is in charge of the market.

108
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,560
Dong Mo Chen.

109
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,320
There's one more person.

110
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,320
is also my brother.

111
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:52,320
Just like us,

112
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,160
an illustrator.

113
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:54,960
Hey, he's here.

114
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:16,280
Hello, I'm Zuo Qianchen.

115
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,160
Hello.

116
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,160
I'm Ye Ru Yi.

117
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,840
Nice to meet you.
