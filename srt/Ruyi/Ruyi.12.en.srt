1
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:41,120
Come on.

2
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:41,480
Drink up.

3
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:42,000
Let's drink.

4
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:48,400
It seems that

5
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:50,040
I can only get out

6
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:51,280
to get out.

7
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:52,400
But how can I kill

8
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:54,400
these two strong men?

9
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:56,560
I can't defeat them.

10
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:58,720
I can only use my wisdom.

11
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:05,360
You...

12
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:06,880
You...

13
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,360
You're pretty.

14
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,039
She's just unlucky.

15
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:20,680
and offended someone.

16
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,760
Let me take good care of you before you die.

17
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:25,000
Brother.

18
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:30,000
Do you only want tonight?

19
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,160
My brother saved my life.

20
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:33,960
Don't give it to the seller.

21
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,360
Can you

22
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,600
be with you forever?

23
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:38,720
Besides,

24
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:40,960
I'll only follow you from now on.

25
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,479
I'm not going anywhere.

26
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,479
No one will know.

27
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:48,000
Really? Are you willing to be with me?

28
00:01:48,039 --> 00:01:49,280
Of course.

29
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,320
You're amazing.

30
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,640
Unlike my useless husband.

31
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,960
I can't even protect my wife.

32
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,320
It's better to be like you.

33
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:00,960
I feel so secure.

34
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,320
But...

35
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:08,720
I just want to follow you.

36
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:11,039
Look at that fatty.

37
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:11,880
He

38
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,840
has bad intentions towards you.

39
00:02:17,079 --> 00:02:17,800
What happened?

40
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:18,920
Tell me.

41
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:22,520
Didn't you sprain your ankle

42
00:02:23,079 --> 00:02:24,640
you sprained your ankle

43
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,400
You almost hit the knife.

44
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,520
I really saw it.

45
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,680
You didn't sprain your ankle.

46
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,079
That fatty.

47
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:33,920
He threw a stone

48
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,360
on your feet.

49
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,120
He has an ulterior motive.

50
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,960
He wants to

51
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:43,120
by himself.

52
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,280
I treat him as my brother.

53
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,040
He treats me like a pushover.

54
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:48,560
No.

55
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,520
I'll kill him.

56
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,320
Brother! Brother! Brother!

57
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:51,640
Don't...

58
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:54,920
Think about it. It's too dangerous for you to do this alone.

59
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,920
Call him over later.

60
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:01,120
I'll distract him for you.

61
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,560
That way, nothing will go wrong.

62
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,520
Right?

63
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,360
Okay.

64
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,440
Thank you.

65
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:21,480
You bitch, you want to make trouble?

66
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:24,160
I'll kill you today.

67
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:30,800
Beauty, don't be afraid.

68
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,960
You are mine now.

69
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:34,800
Fine.

70
00:03:37,079 --> 00:03:38,880
You have to be alive.

71
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,360
Why are you here?

72
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,200
I'm sorry I'm late.

73
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,440
How did you know I was kidnapped?

74
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,000
Phoenix told me.

75
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:35,600
I followed you.

76
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,920
The scattered Marble came here.

77
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:41,720
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

78
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:45,360
I'm fine. I'm smart. How could I get hurt?

79
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:47,360
I just killed two.

80
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,040
Let's go.

81
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,240
I'm tired.

82
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,200
Do you want to sit down and rest?

83
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:27,560
What's wrong?

84
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:47,080
Scorpion-tailed banana.

85
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,800
The Number One Scholar is here to visit his father.

86
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:20,920
Father.

87
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,200
I heard you sent someone to kidnap Ruyi.

88
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,520
What did my sister do

89
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:27,920
to kill her?

90
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,720
You knew Ye Ru Yi wasn't dead,

91
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,360
but you kept it from me.

92
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,840
Ruyi and I have always been obedient to you.

93
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,880
She has listened to you

94
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,840
and married that useless Crown Prince.

95
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,520
Now that the Crown Prince is dead,

96
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:46,880
Can't you let her go?

97
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,360
You bastard!

98
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,840
Do as you say.

99
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:56,840
Without me, you would have frozen to death on the street.

100
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:00,040
I gave you your lives.

101
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:03,080
You should listen to me.

102
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,440
You've raised her for so many years.

103
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,280
She's my daughter.

104
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:11,760
Daughter.

105
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,120
She's just a wild kid who has fed her for years.

106
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,000
Do you really think you're a princess?

107
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,000
Without me,

108
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,320
she's nothing.

109
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:26,280
Without my control,

110
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,800
she must be eliminated.

111
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:31,840
You...

112
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,720
are the same.

113
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,280
Guards!

114
00:07:38,159 --> 00:07:39,760
Young Master is tired.

115
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,720
Take him to rest.

116
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,880
You were poisoned by Scorpion-tail banana.

117
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,760
The poisoned will become crazy and bloodthirsty.

118
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:30,960
Only blood can detoxify the poison.

119
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,240
You saved me.

120
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,280
But I kissed you

121
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:38,559
because I love you.

122
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,360
When I found out you were kidnapped,

123
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:48,120
I've never been so anxious and heartbroken.

124
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,360
I'm afraid of losing you.

125
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,600
I'm afraid I'll never see you again.

126
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,600
I'm afraid you'll leave me.

127
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:06,440
I won't let you be in danger again.

128
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,160
You don't have to

129
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,520
your feelings so soon.

130
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,160
Because in my life,

131
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:16,280
in my life.

132
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:20,040
Don't leave me, okay?

133
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:33,480
I'm sorry.

134
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,600
Yes.

135
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,880
It seems too hard.

136
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,040
Does it hurt?

137
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,760
You did it on purpose.

138
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:01,400
Is Lion Guard really here?

139
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,680
Where are they now?

140
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:10,920
Take a look inside.

141
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:15,600
Get me a sword.

142
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,480
If you're scared,

143
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:30,480
Hold me tight.

144
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:51,920
Dethrone the Crown Prince.

145
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,680
His body and mind are weak.

146
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:55,800
I understand.

147
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:01,760
Hold me tight if you're scared.

148
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:04,800
If you protect me,

149
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,240
I won't be afraid.

150
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:18,520
Why does this look like a dead end?

151
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:26,800
No, this should be a door.

152
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:36,320
Be careful.

153
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,280
Zuo Qianchen.

154
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,680
Look what this is.

155
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,720
Lion Guard.

156
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,040
Map.

157
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:48,200
The founding contributor

158
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,440
to protect the government,

159
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:53,760
but he has an elite army.

160
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,120
Lion Guard.

161
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:58,000
Always prepare for protecting the country.

162
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,720
Only the royal blood...

163
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:03,480
Only the royal blood can find it according to the map.

164
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:06,960
The Lion Guard is hiding.

165
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:13,120
Isn't this another village?
