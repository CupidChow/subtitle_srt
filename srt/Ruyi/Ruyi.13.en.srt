1
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,360
We've sent a signal to Dongxia Chen.

2
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:43,560
He'll pick us up later.

3
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:44,520
Okay.

4
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:47,960
Look what this is.

5
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,240
It's just an ordinary mountain wall.

6
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:55,880
Am I the only one who can see it?

7
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:59,400
Is this the intersection of the Dimension Wall?

8
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,200
We're almost there. Let's go.

9
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:06,600
Okay.

10
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:16,240
What's wrong?

11
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:19,600
If Lion Guard exists

12
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,920
we can defeat Shangguan Kyung-moo.

13
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:27,360
We don't know much about Lion Guard

14
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:30,960
We can only give it a go now.

15
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:33,160
Is the situation very bad?

16
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,800
With the current military deployment,

17
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:49,039
Sister only deployed the guards with the commander’s seal.

18
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:51,840
General Chuyan has been

19
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:55,759
has always been under General Chuyan’s control.

20
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,000
In recent years,

21
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:01,240
General Chuyan and Shangguan Jingmao are close.

22
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:05,520
Why did Shangguan Jingmao get involved with Chuyan?

23
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,880
He doesn’t obey our supervision of political power.

24
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,960
There's someone else without Shangguan Kyung-moo.

25
00:02:17,079 --> 00:02:18,200
So

26
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:22,120
Lion Guard is very important to you.

27
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:24,480
Shangguan Jingmo

28
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,640
is to lock their news forever

29
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:30,200
and leave you alone.

30
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:34,079
Don’t worry. We won’t let him get what he wants.

31
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,320
Lord Shangguan.

32
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:41,280
Those who kidnapped Ye Ruyi were all dead.

33
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,480
How did they die?

34
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,520
Most of them were killed with a sword.

35
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,079
Two of them died in a strange way.

36
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:49,320
One was killed by another.

37
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,360
One was stabbed by a hairpin.

38
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:57,560
It seems that not only has a master helping her,

39
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:01,320
she seems to have changed too.

40
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,360
Humph.

41
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,840
So what?

42
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,680
Just kill them all.

43
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:07,760
Yes.

44
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:12,960
General Chu.

45
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,000
Shangguan.

46
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,360
No change.

47
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,000
Gold Butrade.

48
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:18,960
You're here too.

49
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:19,960
Just in time.

50
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,400
Come on, General Chu.

51
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:25,920
Shangguan.

52
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:26,560
Please.

53
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:40,079
General Chu must know the purpose of this meal.

54
00:03:41,079 --> 00:03:42,800
I wonder

55
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:44,560
what do you think?

56
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:49,800
Shangguan, you should know

57
00:03:51,079 --> 00:03:52,560
For a general,

58
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:56,320
loyalty is more important than life.

59
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:00,960
I know General Chu is not a greedy man.

60
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:04,440
Double salary and a bigger mansion.

61
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:07,880
are nothing to General Chu.

62
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,760
It’s General Chu’s duty

63
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:12,280
is General Chu's duty.

64
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:13,720
But

65
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:16,600
sometimes I feel sorry for General Chu.

66
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:22,440
My beloved son was killed

67
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:25,960
was killed by a fearless war.

68
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,320
Destiny is

69
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,920
to General Chu.

70
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,280
Your suggestion is great.

71
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,400
I don’t want much.

72
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:55,720
I just want them to die with me

73
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,880
on the day of my son's death.

74
00:04:59,000 --> 00:04:59,840
Okay.

75
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,000
Here, General Chu.

76
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:28,480
Phoenix.

77
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,080
Phoenix.

78
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,440
The lock is specially made by Shangguan.

79
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,640
If you force it open,

80
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,960
both of you will be caught.

81
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:53,360
Why?

82
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:54,960
I want to see your master.

83
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,040
Maybe I can help you.

84
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:08,920
There's a night market tonight.

85
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,360
Do you want to go shopping?

86
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:11,520
Really?

87
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:12,960
Will there be fireworks?

88
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,800
If you like it, there will be.

89
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:16,760
Sir.

90
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:34,200
I'll recognize you even if you turn into ashes.

91
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:35,960
Here, slowly.

92
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:51,960
I’m here to help you.

93
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:05,800
Shangguan Jingmao has agreed to cooperate with General Chuyan.

94
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,840
He will take action soon.

95
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,880
General Chu chose to take this step.

96
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,160
Shangguan Jingmao.

97
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,600
What did you tell him?

98
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:21,200
On the 15th of next month, he died in the battle of Bogu.

99
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,240
The anniversary of his son's death.

100
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:31,720
Sir, an important guest is here.

101
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,520
In your room.

102
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,480
Coming.

103
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:42,960
We're closed today.

104
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,320
Guard all the exits.

105
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,120
Yes.

106
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,600
Tell me what you want.

107
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,000
Stop dreaming.

108
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,960
I just have something to tell Ruyi.

109
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:07,640
What is it?

110
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:10,280
in front of her husband.

111
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:17,080
Don't you have an important guest?

112
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:20,320
I know what to do. Don't worry.

113
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,440
Ruyi.

114
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,039
Is he good to you?

115
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:38,679
Did he make you suffer?

116
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,480
If he treats you badly,

117
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:41,240
I...

118
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:41,679
Brother.

119
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:47,280
You're still my brother

120
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,440
you're just my brother.

121
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,120
It's almost the 15th.

122
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:02,640
This

123
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,520
Shangguan Kyung-mo gave it to me

124
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:07,640
Eat it

125
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:10,960
You don't have to keep it.

126
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,480
I'm here now.

127
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,680
Zuo Qianchen

128
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,320
every month.

129
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,480
You stay here.

130
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,440
We need to think about the rest.

131
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,720
It's too dangerous for you to leave the palace now.

132
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,120
The Lion Guard is very important.

133
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,680
I have to tell you face to face.

134
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,240
I have reliable news.

135
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,240
Chuyan has decided to rebel.

136
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:54,840
It’s all my fault.

137
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,480
Dust, the past is unpredictable.

138
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,800
You can pursue the past.

139
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,200
The imperial court is in danger now.

140
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,400
I can trust only one person.

141
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:06,400
It's you.

142
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:08,960
In that case,

143
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,640
I'll find the Lion Guard.

144
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:12,600
I'll go.

145
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:14,320
Don't worry.

146
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,440
It's a long journey.

147
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,560
and dangerous.

148
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,160
Please take care of yourself.

149
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,520
I should have died in that battle.

150
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:27,720
But now,

151
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,800
I only care about one person.

152
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,880
She shouldn't suffer like me.

153
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:54,960
Why are you here?

154
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,160
I bought you this.

155
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,280
What's wrong?

156
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,400
Did you have fun?

157
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:10,360
Yes.

158
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,000
I'm doing well every day.

159
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:18,560
That's good.

160
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:22,600
Take care of yourself.

161
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:25,160
Okay.

162
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:31,400
I'm sick of it.

163
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,000
Let's get divorced.
