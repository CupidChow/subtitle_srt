1
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:09,200
It makes people hallucinate.

2
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,039
that can cause hallucinations.

3
00:01:16,039 --> 00:01:18,600
Now I’ll see how long

4
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:20,560
can survive for a few days.

5
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:22,920
Lord Shangguan.

6
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:25,560
I have given you the medicine.

7
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,760
I have a request.

8
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:33,160
Just let me know.

9
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:35,720
I want to be alone.

10
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,240
You know.

11
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,000
We all want to kill him.

12
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:47,160
It doesn't matter who does it.

13
00:01:48,039 --> 00:01:48,840
No.

14
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,360
I'll kill him myself.

15
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,800
He deserves to die.

16
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:57,200
I'll ruin his reputation.

17
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,360
Okay.

18
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,520
As you wish.

19
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:02,240
Here.

20
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:10,080
This is the fifth girl who disappeared this month.

21
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:11,560
Who did this?

22
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,560
Why can't the government catch him?

23
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,880
Is it a ghost?

24
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,000
Long time no see.

25
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,200
Lu.

26
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,000
Why are you here?

27
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,760
How have you been?

28
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,880
I had a hard time, but I'm fine.

29
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,360
I lost my pouch.

30
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,520
Who took my pouch?

31
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,920
In broad daylight,

32
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,600
in broad daylight?

33
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:01,880
Is there any law?

34
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,480
Dong Mo Chen, take care of her.

35
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:08,080
He stole my pouch and caught him.

36
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:14,760
Let go of me. I can walk on my own.

37
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,240
Your Highness.

38
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,640
Give this jade pendant

39
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,880
to my daughter.

40
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,920
You've seen her.

41
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:46,840
She has a mole under her eyes.

42
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,920
is exactly

43
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,120
the same as me.

44
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,440
Promise me.

45
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,560
you will help me

46
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,080
take good care of her.

47
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,400
Your Highness.

48
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,000
Your Highness!

49
00:04:57,159 --> 00:04:58,040
Are you okay?

50
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,840
What's going on outside?

51
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,440
There is indeed a missing woman.

52
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,360
I will find out the truth.

53
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,200
Be quick.

54
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:08,120
We have more important things to do.

55
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,640
We can't stay here forever.

56
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,080
The cell is loose.

57
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:12,920
Let's go.

58
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:13,560
No.

59
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,040
If we leave, what about her?

60
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,200
She is Zhao Guanhai's daughter.

61
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,720
But she seems to have recognized you long ago.

62
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,440
Your Highness, you can't trust her completely.

63
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,400
Besides, she seems

64
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,280
is related to the missing woman case.

65
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:32,680
Keep her safe.

66
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,440
I owe her this.

67
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,159
Also,

68
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,840
find out where the missing girl is as soon as possible.

69
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,159
and save her.

70
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,000
Don't put the blame on us.

71
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,120
This...

72
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,040
Go.

73
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,040
Yes.

74
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,960
In real life,

75
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:04,680
I advised other sisters not to be sad for men.

76
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,760
but I ended up falling for it.

77
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:29,720
Have a safe trip.

78
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,040
I still need money.

79
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,080
Take care of Ruyi.

80
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,440
The fifteenth day is coming. Don't forget the antidote.

81
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,120
Zuo Qianchen.

82
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,120
Just leave.

83
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,400
Stop pretending to be affectionate.

84
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:46,840
Ruyi.

85
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,200
Looking for this?

86
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:52,920
Ruyi, the manager is worried about you.

87
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,960
What is he moving about?

88
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,640
I thought

89
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,200
after you lost,

90
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:06,120
Uncle quickly saved me.

91
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,000
After I went back,

92
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,600
the whole village was gone.

93
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,760
Until I found that jade pendant,

94
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,480
that you've been there.

95
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,560
I'm glad you're okay.

96
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:21,080
I know some clues about the missing women.

97
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,960
They might be hiding here.

98
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:30,200
I've taken care of the guards.

99
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,720
I need you to save these women.

100
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,040
Don't be afraid.

101
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,120
I'm here to save you.

102
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,320
The demon who uses women to cultivate alchemy is in the room.

103
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:30,480
Soldiers, listen up.

104
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,720
Take him down.

105
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,960
My lord, it's him.

106
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,280
He wanted to kill them to make medicine.

107
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:47,440
I thought the Crown Prince was just

108
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,280
and arrogant.

109
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:51,680
I didn't expect that in order to make medicine, he could kill others.

110
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,200
Take him down!

111
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,040
Let go!

112
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:58,960
I can walk.

113
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:08,880
Lu, is your uncle Shangguan Jingmo?

114
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,600
You can only blame yourself.

115
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,640
When I dreamed of midnight these years,

116
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:15,480
did my father kill you?
