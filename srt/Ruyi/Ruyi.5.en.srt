1
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:56,240
Ruyi.

2
00:00:58,600 --> 00:00:59,760
Go get the fruit.

3
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:00,240
Yes.

4
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:02,680
Ruyi.

5
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:23,720
Father.

6
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:25,960
No.

7
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,320
I

8
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,760
I have two questions for you today.

9
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:31,320
Go ahead, Father.

10
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:35,479
How is the investigation on the letter leakage?

11
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:37,520
It's still under investigation.

12
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:39,640
This matter is very important.

13
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:40,920
We can't delay it.

14
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:45,520
The current progress is not your level.

15
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:48,039
Also,

16
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:52,960
your marriage with the princess should be scheduled.

17
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:08,960
Father.

18
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:11,680
This matter is very important.

19
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,040
We need a long-term plan.

20
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,360
No.

21
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:19,920
Have you forgotten how Ruyi died?

22
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:24,120
Get married as soon as possible.

23
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,640
and help each other from inside and outside.

24
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:26,880
and control the court.

25
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,120
and restore the country.

26
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,400
will come soon.

27
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,200
I...

28
00:02:31,079 --> 00:02:32,240
Tomorrow,

29
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,079
tomorrow.

30
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:37,520
to marry the princess.

31
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,880
No.

32
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,880
I trust you.

33
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:56,680
You won't let me down.

34
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,920
Sorry for troubling you last night.

35
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:26,880
Master One Ear.

36
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,160
Not at all.

37
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:32,560
Breakfast is ready.

38
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,360
Come down and eat.

39
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,040
Oh.

40
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,760
Have some buns.

41
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:06,960
OK.

42
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,280
Tell me.

43
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:13,200
The princess is going to marry the Number One Scholar Kim.

44
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:25,320
There must be something wrong with this marriage.

45
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,360
I can't wait.

46
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,640
Why don't we take this opportunity

47
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,640
to expose his identity as the Crown Prince of the previous dynasty.

48
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,600
No.

49
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,240
The Liu family has only been in charge for decades.

50
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,120
The foundation is not stable.

51
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:01,160
Most main players in the army

52
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,720
retired without knowing where to go.

53
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:06,040
Now some of the soldiers

54
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,920
are still prisoners of the previous dynasty.

55
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,480
If Shangguan Jingmao's identity is exposed,

56
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,160
they might really rebel.

57
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,680
So we have to wait and see?

58
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:17,960
His move can move forward and retreat.

59
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:21,720
He believes that there's no way in the court. will be in his hands.

60
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:23,720
In that case,

61
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,200
let's take a risky move.

62
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:30,160
If we expose his identity as the Crown Prince of the previous dynasty,

63
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,159
it will only make him

64
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:35,800
in the future.

65
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,520
In order to live forever,

66
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,280
he killed so many children and girls.

67
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,600
and to be protected by the God of War,

68
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,320
so many soldiers.

69
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:47,320
In the end,

70
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,880
he blamed everything on a woman.

71
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:50,920
How could someone like him

72
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,040
would never

73
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,320
love the people as their children?

74
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:56,880
Why don't we...

75
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,840
He has many masters around him.

76
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,720
We can't get close to him.

77
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:08,640
I'm thinking

78
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,920
we should compromise and get married

79
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,200
and reorganize.

80
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,400
No.

81
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,960
We can only be passive.

82
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,320
Besides, this is your marriage.

83
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,920
Nothing is more important than the safety of the people.

84
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,160
Take care of yourself.

85
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,760
Don't be impulsive.

86
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,120
The princess is finally getting married.

87
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:45,120
The empire is no longer in charge of women.

88
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,640
Princess has been

89
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,040
in the past few years.

90
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,400
But women

91
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,760
will get married eventually.

92
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,240
The Number One Scholar is in charge now.

93
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,680
Life will be better.

94
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,880
Okay.

95
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:00,800
Ruyi.

96
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:01,760
It's really you.

97
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,240
You're not dead.

98
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:05,760
Gold Butrade.

99
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:07,200
No.

100
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,000
That's great.

101
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,200
What are you doing?

102
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,240
I won't let you leave me again.

103
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:13,520
Let go of me.

104
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,360
Ruyi, come with me.

105
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,360
Ruyi, come back with me.

106
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:23,000
You won't exchange gold, right?

107
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,320
Please behave yourself.

108
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:25,880
Ruyi.

109
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:26,280
This...

110
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,320
Come back with me.

111
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,120
Ah.

112
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,200
Look at that.

113
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,440
Are you worried

114
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,560
the marriage between the princess and the Number One Scholar?

115
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:18,480
I don't know what's going on,

116
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,400
but I know

117
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:23,360
when two people who don't love each other get married,

118
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,400
will never be happy.

119
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,120
Among them,

120
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:30,400
is full of calculations and use.

121
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:36,559
What about you?

122
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,720
Are you worried about your childhood friend?

123
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:40,640
Kim Boo-jae?

124
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,880
What does this have to do with it?

125
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,200
You saw

126
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,080
You saw it.

127
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,200
Pull and pull.

128
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:51,480
It's hard to not see it.

129
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,120
You care so much about the gold.

130
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,920
Do you

131
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:04,800
like the princess?

132
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:08,720
If you keep talking nonsense,

133
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,880
I'll find an elixir to poison you to mute.

134
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:20,720
You smell so familiar.

135
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:22,840
You...

136
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:23,840
Don't you want to know

137
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:26,480
why you want to stop him from marrying the princess?

138
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:29,680
Once they get married,

139
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:32,320
the throne will belong to Shangguan Jingmo.

140
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:43,880
I have an idea.

141
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,200
Stay out of this.

142
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,040
Okay.

143
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,600
Just protect yourself.

144
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:51,520
We don't need to get involved in this.

145
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,600
That thing

146
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,160
can help us.

147
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,880
My cousin's horoscope is...

148
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,280
Bing Shen.

149
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:05,440
Ding Mao.

150
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,200
Gengzi and Yi Chou.

151
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,120
The horoscope

152
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,960
is a once-in-a-century-old Ziwei Star.

153
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,000
It can save the people.

154
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:16,760
Is he?

155
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:18,720
He can be
