1
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:42,200
It's like this. It's like this.

2
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:43,280
You don't know?

3
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,840
You can buy a Tear-Tear Award with five cents.

4
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:47,720
Then go to the stamp office

5
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:50,440
Take six out of 33 numbers.

6
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,160
They'll stamp their exclusive numbers

7
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:55,080
in case it's fake.

8
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:56,960
We can win the award that night.

9
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,840
If the numbers are right,

10
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:02,200
you'll get 50 taels of bonus on the spot.

11
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,600
That simple?

12
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,519
I have to buy one.

13
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:09,680
Don't push.

14
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:19,400
This is your idea?

15
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,320
Am I smart?

16
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:25,360
Everyone has a big mentality.

17
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,400
Miss Ye, a young master is looking for you.

18
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:31,880
Young master.

19
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:34,759
Many people are looking for you.

20
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:40,640
Sorry, Ms. Qian.

21
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:45,640
I was afraid of being recognized.

22
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:47,640
I didn't mean to lie to you.

23
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,000
No.

24
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:51,920
It's my fault.

25
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,759
I was too impatient.

26
00:01:55,039 --> 00:01:56,640
Let's get to know each other again.

27
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,000
My name is Ye Ruyi.

28
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,080
My name is Ricky.

29
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:13,400
The business is so good now.

30
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,120
You have a good business.

31
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:17,640
I envy you.

32
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,480
Unlike my father.

33
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,800
He always said women should get married soon.

34
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,160
and take care of her family.

35
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:27,800
You can't always show up outside.

36
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,120
What's wrong with women?

37
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,400
You're very capable.

38
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:32,400
I...

39
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,680
I heard from your guys that

40
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,400
you managed the restaurant very well.

41
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,440
But my father...

42
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:48,640
How about this?

43
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,480
you help me?

44
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,280
I'm not capable enough.

45
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,320
I really need you.

46
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:12,680
Are you bored?

47
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,120
Don't you need help?

48
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,120
What's wrong with him?

49
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,320
He...

50
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,520
He's afraid we'll finish his tea.

51
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,280
Here, drink more.

52
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,960
How did you find me?

53
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:46,400
The face of Cang River is the signboard.

54
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,840
He's good at everything.

55
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,520
Most importantly, he's handsome.

56
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,880
Everyone in the city knows him.

57
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,560
Everyone wants to see his charm.

58
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,080
Welcome

59
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,560
Today, we're going to

60
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,320
we don't know.

61
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:10,520
As you all know,

62
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,400
Some time ago,

63
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,280
something happened.

64
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:16,480
We also deeply realized the vicious nature of gambling.

65
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,079
So we will

66
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:19,800
every day

67
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,079
to donate a penny of profit

68
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:22,079
to Qingxuan Temple

69
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,280
to make up for our mistakes.

70
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:27,280
Qingxuan Temple will use this money to help the poor.

71
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:29,920
and give each participant a merit card

72
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,360
to commemorate what you've done.

73
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,800
Please watch us from now on.

74
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,280
Alright, cut the crap.

75
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,760
Let's start today's lucky draw.

76
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,159
The first number.

77
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,360
Six.

78
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,600
The second one.

79
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,080
32.

80
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,680
The third number is

81
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,320
27.

82
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,280
The fourth number is...

83
00:04:58,680 --> 00:04:59,440
Eight.

84
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,120
The fifth one.

85
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:02,600
Thirteen.

86
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:10,120
The last one is...

87
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,320
25.

88
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:11,920
Eighteen.

89
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:13,400
15.

90
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:13,880
Twenty-four.

91
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:14,560
25.

92
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,000
Six.

93
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:15,760
15.

94
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:16,560
Eighteen.

95
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,120
Eighteen.

96
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:20,400
All right. I won.

97
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:23,960
Congratulations.

98
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:28,040
You got it all right.

99
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:28,840
Thank you.

100
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31,240
All right.

101
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,800
Have you solved the military pay?

102
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:45,520
Thank you, Miss Ruyi.

103
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,400
What's wrong?

104
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:54,280
Are you jealous of money?

105
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:55,920
How much money?

106
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,960
What are you thinking all day long?

107
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:01,800
You...

108
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,120
By the way,

109
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,720
this is the poisonous bun you ate that day.

110
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:14,000
I found it on the desk of the courtyard

111
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:22,400
This doesn't look like Shangguan Jingmo's handwriting

112
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,160
Besides

113
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,960
Why would he do that to you?

114
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,160
Because he was the Crown Prince of the previous dynasty.

115
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:32,360
Why are you against Shangguan Jingmao?

116
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:34,840
Because I hate him.

117
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:36,960
I used everyone as my tool.

118
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,560
I want to get rid of him

119
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:40,680
and live as myself.

120
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,080
You too, right?

121
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,880
From now on,

122
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,360
together.

123
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,360
We don't hide anything from each other anymore.

124
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:55,720
Okay?

125
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:37,880
Ruyi.

126
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:40,800
You never

127
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,720
treated me like this before.

128
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,200
You said it was in the past.

129
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,480
I have no feelings for you now.

130
00:07:52,159 --> 00:07:53,680
If you're not happy here,

131
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:55,400
If you want to leave,

132
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:58,440
if you want to leave.

133
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,000
But I will make you

134
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,400
come back to me.

135
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,560
Shangguan Kyung-moo is not a good person.

136
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,880
Don't let him lead you.

137
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:14,800
I will find the antidote

138
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,840
I will find the antidote.

139
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:30,840
Come on.

140
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:31,720
Cheers.

141
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:39,360
Thanks to Ruyi,

142
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:42,000
we can reopen without knowing anything.

143
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,919
No, mainly...

144
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:45,320
It's mainly about the amount.

145
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,080
Thank you.

146
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,640
I can't do it without you.

147
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,600
Together

148
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:50,480
Cheers!

149
00:08:58,760 --> 00:08:59,840
Max, let's go.

150
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,800
You guys drink.

151
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,720
Let's go.

152
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:54,880
Zuo Qianchen.

153
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:55,960
Yes.

154
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:03,120
Why are you so handsome?

155
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:09,200
Thank you.

156
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,320
How about taking you out tomorrow?

157
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:14,280
Sure, let's go out tomorrow.

158
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,440
You're sweet when you're drunk.

159
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:21,560
Sweet mouth.

160
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:32,440
Is it sweet?

161
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,480
I’m going on a date tomorrow.

162
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,320
Phoenix.

163
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:10,560
Is it so hard to kill someone?

164
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:15,640
I didn't expect you can't even poison me.

165
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,760
I'm so disappointed.

166
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:20,520
My lord.

167
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:22,200
Please give me another chance.

168
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:24,240
I will complete the mission.

169
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,120
Leave me alive.

170
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,200
Don't worry.

171
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,440
This medicine won't kill you.

172
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,520
It's just a pain.

173
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,520
and learn a lesson.

174
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:41,320
I know what to do in the future.

175
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,000
and what I shouldn't do.

176
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,000
My lord.

177
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:04,840
Good boy.

178
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:07,440
As long as you behave,

179
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,320
everything will be yours.
