1
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:25,320
Girl, we meet again.

2
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:36,120
You look like that old man.

3
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:38,680
My father said he wanted to promote you.

4
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:39,960
but you refused.

5
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:43,880
He wanted me to work for him for the rest of my life.

6
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:45,039
and worry about him forever.

7
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:46,520
I don't want to.

8
00:01:46,759 --> 00:01:49,280
How comfortable life is on this island.

9
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:53,800
How is your father?

10
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,200
Not good.

11
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,240
My father has been seriously ill

12
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,200
and has become more and more unconscious.

13
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,400
I told your father

14
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:04,640
he's thoughtful.

15
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,320
It will definitely affect his health.

16
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,880
Shangguan Jingmao has started his restoration plan.

17
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,920
General Chuyan decided to join hands with him.

18
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,400
The war will start soon.

19
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,600
Alas.

20
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:21,960
I was too soft-hearted

21
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,560
and spared Shangguan's life.

22
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:26,200
We should have killed him.

23
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,920
I'll meet the soldiers immediately.

24
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:30,640
Let’s set out to catch the rebels.

25
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:33,680
General Qin must be careful.

26
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,920
Shangguan Jingmao has a thorough plan

27
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,520
to restore the country.

28
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:38,240
Humph.

29
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:41,160
We could even fight the most vicious enemy back then.

30
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:44,120
the most vicious foreign enemies.

31
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,440
It's not worth mentioning.

32
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,000
You mean...

33
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:52,680
Five years ago,

34
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,520
you defeated the foreign enemies in Yaojiang.

35
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:00,040
Since you have repelled the enemy,

36
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,560
why do you still want to fight again?

37
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,200
Before winter,

38
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,360
we had defeated the enemy.

39
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,800
I was injured and returned to Fengling Manor.

40
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:12,000
It seems that the news of victory was sent to Shangguan.

41
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,240
The enemy from Yaojiang

42
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,840
They are wearing black

43
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:18,760
wearing black

44
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,160
and took the risk.

45
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,880
and used the flint to kill them.

46
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:28,560
Seamless Stitch.

47
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:35,960
So the Huguang Army killed the 5,000 soldiers.

48
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,400
They were killed

49
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,280
who fought alongside them.

50
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,040
Old man.

51
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,640
What evidence do you have?

52
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:56,120
General Qin, this is Brother Zhao's daughter.

53
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,440
I’m glad to see

54
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:02,440
I'm so happy.

55
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,480
When Yaojiang was defeated,

56
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:09,280
I requested a truce immediately.

57
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,200
Shangguan is

58
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,320
is really sinister.

59
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:31,960
All these years, Dust has been blaming himself for his wrong decision.

60
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,080
But no matter what he chooses,

61
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,360
it's a dead end.

62
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:45,520
I left in a hurry when I went to your full moon wine.

63
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,720
I forgot to bring you a gift from my wife.

64
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,640
You must live well from now on.

65
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,200
He killed my father.

66
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:59,720
I've been working for my father's enemy.

67
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:01,320
No.

68
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,560
Impossible.

69
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:04,840
No.

70
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,320
You're awake.

71
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,600
How are you?

72
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,960
Are you feeling unwell?

73
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:42,440
Don't worry.

74
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:46,240
We will avenge them.

75
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,560
This is a tonic.

76
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,440
You'll be very energetic after you drink it.

77
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,320
You'll get stronger

78
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,840
This is the antidote

79
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,520
made for you.

80
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,160
After eating it,

81
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:15,520
you can completely get rid of this villain.

82
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,840
Zuo Qianchen, I have a request.

83
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,560
This is the poison I made.

84
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,080
If it's possible,

85
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,320
please apply it on Shangguan Jingmo's sword.

86
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,840
I want him to die.

87
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,480
Soldiers, listen up.

88
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,760
Arrest the rebel Shangguan Jingmao.

89
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,320
We'll set out in three days.

90
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,120
Yes.

91
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,040
Zuo Qianchen.

92
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,040
Ruyi.

93
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,360
It's really dangerous.

94
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:15,080
Why don't you go back first?

95
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:16,840
Zuo Qianchen.

96
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,720
Do you like making decisions for me that much?

97
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:26,880
Girl.

98
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,600
We'll depart in three days.

99
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,640
I have a big thing in mind before I leave.

100
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:33,600
I think you can solve it for me.

101
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,840
General Qin, if I can help,

102
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:36,800
just let me know.

103
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,000
Girl, how about you be my daughter-in-law?

104
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:42,200
You've divorced him anyway.

105
00:07:43,159 --> 00:07:43,760
No.

106
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:46,760
This is a bit sudden.

107
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,600
My son is about your age.

108
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:51,960
He's still single.

109
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:54,280
You're the most eye-catching girl I've ever met.

110
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,920
I just want you to be my daughter-in-law.

111
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,200
What do you think?

112
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,200
Think about it.

113
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:08,880
Since General Qin asked,

114
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,640
I can’t let you down, right?

115
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:11,600
Yes.

116
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,600
When Brother Qin comes back,

117
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,640
we can talk.

118
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,360
Okay, it's a deal.

119
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,080
What are you doing?

120
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:38,640
Are you looking for Ye Ru Yi?

121
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,000
No.

122
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I was taking a walk.

123
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,720
You're really bad at lying.

124
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:45,800
If you're looking for Ye Ru Yi,

125
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,320
he went out with General Qin.

126
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,600
Gone?

127
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,360
Where did she go?

128
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,160
Where did she go?

129
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:52,760
I don't know.

130
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,600
The old man said he had something important to do.

131
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,560
Maybe he went to meet someone.

132
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:13,880
What are you doing here?

133
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:17,960
General Qin.

134
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,400
I took you to him.

135
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,080
Yes.

136
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,360
I saw him.

137
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:23,480
Very cool.

138
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:24,400
Very powerful.

139
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:27,480
Good for you.

140
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,400
You can find someone else in a few days.

141
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,040
Yes.

142
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,800
I'm single.

143
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:34,600
And I'm a young girl.

144
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,920
What's wrong with me talking about love?

145
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,160
No.

146
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,520
What do you mean no?

147
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:54,680
If you want to talk about love,

148
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,600
can't you talk to me?

149
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,520
Zuo Qianchen,

150
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,640
You said the divorce first.

151
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,800
I was wrong, Ruyi.

152
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,640
Can you not leave me?

153
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:16,040
You even want to be jealous of a rooster?

154
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:18,440
Little rooster?

155
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,080
How is it? I didn't lie to you, right?

156
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:24,800
Very handsome.

157
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,480
I knew you would like it.

158
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:28,840
Very handsome.

159
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:29,920
Very powerful.

160
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,280
Of course.

161
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,080
What happened to your face?

162
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,120
Why is your face so red?

163
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,040
Take the medicine Lu gave you.

164
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:55,040
I drank.

165
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:58,000
I can still drink.

166
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,720
You seem to have recovered well.

167
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:02,840
I have something on my mind.

168
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,400
Do you want to tell me?

169
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:12,160
I'm sad every day.

170
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,320
and unhappy.

171
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:17,120
I regret it.

172
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,760
I was afraid that you would really leave me.

173
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:26,840
But I've made up my mind.

174
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,840
So what?

175
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:31,720
I've decided

176
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:34,280
I won't be a coward anymore.

177
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,840
I will face my heart bravely.

178
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,840
I like Ye Ru Yi.

179
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:42,760
This is the last time.

180
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,320
If you do this again, I'm really leaving.

181
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:46,480
One last time.

182
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:47,360
One last time.

183
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,120
Thank you, Ruyi.

184
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,040
Thank you for encouraging me and trusting me.

185
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:56,640
and love me.

186
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,720
Who loves you?

187
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,120
You said

188
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,560
the sunset is beautiful.

189
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:11,640
You too.
