1
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,640
What are you doing?

2
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:03,640
Hey, let me ask you.

3
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,239
Do you know Ruo?

4
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:12,560
What’s wrong with that?

5
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:14,039
Let me tell you.

6
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:15,640
this woman is not simple.

7
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:17,560
You and I are no match for her.

8
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:19,880
What are you waiting for?

9
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,080
Let's go.

10
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,039
No, no.

11
00:01:22,039 --> 00:01:22,920
What are you doing?

12
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:23,880
What's the use of leaving?

13
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:25,080
Let me tell you.

14
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:26,240
there is only one way now.

15
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:28,039
If we were a loving couple,

16
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:30,520
his plan to frame me and assassinate you wouldn't have succeeded.

17
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,440
What do you mean?

18
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,160
Miss.

19
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,000
Young Master.

20
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:36,080
I...

21
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:37,479
What?

22
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,479
We are in the same boat.

23
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,520
You have to listen to me.

24
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:42,400
You won't die.

25
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:56,320
Newlyweds.

26
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,120
Please forgive us.

27
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,320
I'll wait for you at the alley.

28
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:20,160
It's just a show, right?

29
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,040
You're more experienced.

30
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,320
No one treats you as a mute if you don't talk.

31
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:31,840
Let's go.

32
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,320
My legs hurt. My legs hurt.

33
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:33,840
Let's go.

34
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:34,400
OK.

35
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:52,520
Didn’t Ruo ask you to have a good rest?

36
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,240
She’s always weak.

37
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,200
I want to make her some soup.

38
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,000
Really? Let me see.

39
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,720
Ruo is really good at cooking.

40
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,520
Can I learn from you?

41
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,160
Zuo Qianchen.

42
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,440
What are you doing?

43
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,480
You even want to kill a little girl.

44
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,480
You're a beast.

45
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:18,800
Did he bully you?

46
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:19,800
You have to tell me.

47
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,920
I know you're worse than a beast.

48
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,840
I didn't expect you to be so crazy.

49
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:25,680
Ignore him. Let's go.

50
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,520
Are you hurt?

51
00:03:37,079 --> 00:03:37,880
No.

52
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,440
We are both women.

53
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,480
If you feel wronged,

54
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:41,680
you must tell me.

55
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,000
I will protect you.

56
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,960
Your Highness, this is highly poisonous. A small amount will kill you.

57
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:50,920
I know.

58
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:51,680
Your Highness.

59
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,400
The foster daughter of Shangguan is really dangerous.

60
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:54,920
Why do you still help her?

61
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:57,680
I can't kill her now.

62
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,600
I can't let Shangguan Jingmo

63
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,040
to blame me.

64
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:02,280
I understand.

65
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:03,480
Zuo Qianchen.

66
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:04,840
Zuo Qianchen.

67
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:09,920
What's that look?

68
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,520
You look like someone owes you money.

69
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:21,600
What are you doing?

70
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:23,920
You...

71
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,520
Calm down.

72
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,560
We have to act.

73
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,480
Ye Ru Yi!

74
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:40,000
You brat!

75
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,560
You're just a loser.

76
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,520
I'm not.

77
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,920
You are. Everyone knows that

78
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,280
you and your mother are tough.

79
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,600
and killed your father.

80
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,080
You’ll be called Phoenix.

81
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:15,160
No one knows your existence except me.

82
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,480
We are all women.

83
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,600
Tell me if you feel wronged.

84
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,240
I will protect you.

85
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,200
Ruyi.

86
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:35,800
I'm sorry.

87
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:37,920
If there is a next life,

88
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,120
I hope

89
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,320
I hope you can live a good life.

90
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:53,560
and come to my wife.

91
00:05:55,159 --> 00:05:57,200
I wonder why she hasn't woken up today.

92
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,280
I've never seen her sleep so much.

93
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,200
Come in and take a look.

94
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,720
You're not dead?

95
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:16,840
I'm sorry.

96
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,000
Your plan failed.

97
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,720
I put enough vines

98
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,240
and changed it to Guanyin soil.

99
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:23,760
What is it?

100
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,000
You can't eat that much.

101
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,120
You can eat it all.

102
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,240
The assassination failed, but the assassination changed, right?

103
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,400
Are you sure this is what Shangguan wants?

104
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,200
Ruo.

105
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,360
Shangguan Jingmao is just using you.

106
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:48,920
You won't understand me.

107
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,240
Who are you? Why are you following me?

108
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:14,760
Master with one ear.

109
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,720
Why are you here?

110
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,680
Miss Ye, it's been a long time since you've been here.

111
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,640
My best friend is here to visit you.

112
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,120
Okay.

113
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,520
Why are you so sad, Miss Ye?

114
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,280
Tell me.

115
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:34,000
and let me clear things up.

116
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,000
Warrior Zhao,

117
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,360
If someone wants to kill me,

118
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:44,520
how can I get rid of the fate of being hunted down?

119
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,360
Why would he kill you?

120
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:50,440
He wants to frame someone else for my death.

121
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:53,560
There are two ways.

122
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,120
or kill him.

123
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,520
No.

124
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,600
He has too many men.

125
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,000
One of them will die.

126
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,480
Let's do it first.

127
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,640
Kill the person who was framed.

128
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,280
Then the plan will fail.

129
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:11,280
That's true, but...

130
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:13,640
But...

131
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,240
Just what?

132
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,080
Do you have to kill someone?

133
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,560
Is there any other way?

134
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,600
If you don't want to,

135
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,360
I can do it for you.

136
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,800
Let me think about it.

137
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,600
For me?

138
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,400
Yes.

139
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,560
I made too much.

140
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,240
Drink it while it's hot.

141
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:17,800
You're so kind.

142
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,280
What's wrong?

143
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,200
What are you doing?

144
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,520
The bowl is cold.

145
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:51,160
I'll get you another bowl.

146
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,280
Hey.

147
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,280
Who are you?

148
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,520
Hey.

149
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:01,680
What's wrong?

150
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,440
Take me to a place where I don't know.
