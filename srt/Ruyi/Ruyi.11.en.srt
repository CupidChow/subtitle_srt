1
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:54,960
Thank you.

2
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:56,560
Are you hurt?

3
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:58,760
No.

4
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:01,560
You're not dead.

5
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:04,480
Good.

6
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,760
Dong Mo Chen told me

7
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:09,080
you saved my life because you insisted on the dragon bone.

8
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,120
Thank you.

9
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:12,440
[Shangguan Kyung-mo]

10
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:13,880
He treated you so badly.

11
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:15,600
Why did you help him?

12
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:17,440
He saved my life.

13
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:19,840
So I can't...

14
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,840
He saved you, so he can beat you like this.

15
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:25,920
He also taught me martial arts.

16
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:28,000
and made me who I am today.

17
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,440
But he controlled you with drugs.

18
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:31,520
control you

19
00:01:32,039 --> 00:01:33,520
Because of your talent,

20
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,280
because of your talents.

21
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:38,160
Have you ever thought

22
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,479
if he doesn't use drugs to control you,

23
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:43,440
you may

24
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,200
have a different life.

25
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,720
Have a good rest.

26
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,280
Call me if you need anything.

27
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:01,840
How can I help you?

28
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:09,639
There is one thing.

29
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,480
But it's a little dangerous.

30
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,520
You can refuse.

31
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I do.

32
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:22,240
You're not afraid of danger?

33
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,640
It's not easy to save your life.

34
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,120
I have nothing to lose.

35
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:32,240
Ye Ru Yi can help you.

36
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,120
I have no regrets.

37
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:36,920
Okay.

38
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,800
We hope you can let those innocent girls go.

39
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:46,840
By the way,

40
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:47,960
can that fruit

41
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:50,160
really detoxicate those girls?

42
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,160
These girls are not deeply poisoned.

43
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,600
They can be detoxified. Don't worry.

44
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,200
That’s good.

45
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,600
Ruo.

46
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,720
If you don’t want to go back,

47
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,880
there are

48
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,560
There is

49
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:11,440
that can cure your poison.

50
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,240
Didn't we agree that

51
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,160
After I let those girls go,

52
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:18,400
Shangguan Jingmao lacks people.

53
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,640
Isn't this the best chance for me to hide?

54
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:24,200
But Shangguan Jingmao has so many thoughts.

55
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,320
You'll be in danger.

56
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:29,680
I'm not just trying to repay you for saving my life.

57
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,600
I want Shangguan Jingmo

58
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,079
pay the price he deserves.

59
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:41,600
Ye Ruyi.

60
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,640
My name is Phoenix.

61
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:46,680
Phoenix.

62
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,079
Take care.

63
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:58,520
Don't worry, Dongxia Chen will protect her.

64
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,280
With such a big mistake,

65
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,680
What did you do?

66
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,080
We were careless.

67
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,440
How many people have escaped?

68
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,400
It's just that

69
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,240
are not many.

70
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,040
What do you know?

71
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:17,279
If someone runs away,

72
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,360
it will disturb people.

73
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,760
Find out what happened.

74
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:24,920
Also,

75
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,680
inform Lu to come.

76
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:29,200
Ask her to investigate the source of the medicine.

77
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:29,960
Yes.

78
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,480
Did he give you a hard time?

79
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,560
No. Just like what we said before,

80
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,480
No one can use him.

81
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,520
He can only trust me.

82
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,520
How will he investigate the girl's escape?

83
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,480
We're still investigating.

84
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:48,760
Currently, we only suspect that the evil medicine has lost its effect.

85
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,680
and sent someone to ask Lu to make the medicine.

86
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,840
But once the new drug is made,

87
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:56,360
we don't know if it's still within our control.

88
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,880
Dong Mo Chen, look into this man.

89
00:04:59,280 --> 00:04:59,960
Yes.

90
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,480
I can't stay here for long.

91
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:05,720
Take care.

92
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,040
You too.

93
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,280
Be careful.

94
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:10,400
Okay.

95
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:14,920
Phoenix.

96
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,000
I saw it by chance.

97
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,240
I think it suits you.

98
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:30,560
Thank you.

99
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,480
Try it.

100
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:34,560
Okay.

101
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,159
Hold this for me.

102
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,560
Let me help you.

103
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,080
Okay.

104
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:23,640
Done.

105
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:29,960
Do I look good?

106
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,200
Yes.

107
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,080
Xiaolu is here.

108
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:54,760
You must be tired.

109
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:56,040
You must be tired.

110
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,800
I've been in the city lately.

111
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:58,880
Not at all.

112
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,120
I heard my medicine didn't work.

113
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,480
The girls I bought

114
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:11,960
ran away.

115
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:16,680
It's not all my fault that the girl ran away.

116
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,720
Have you ever thought

117
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,560
someone around you gave them the antidote?

118
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,280
You mean

119
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:27,000
I saw your foster daughter Ye Ru Yi

120
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:29,880
picked up a dying person on the street.

121
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:34,080
Judging from his figure, he should be the one beside you.

122
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,200
Phoenix.

123
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,880
You mean Ye Ru Yi is still alive?

124
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:40,120
She didn't die in that fire.

125
00:07:41,159 --> 00:07:43,120
Immortal.

126
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,760
can resist my medicine.

127
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,400
Is this Ye Ru Yi

128
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:50,080
the legendary meta abilities?

129
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,040
Maybe

130
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:54,880
may be good material for alchemy.

131
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:00,920
I underestimated my foster daughter.

132
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:04,040
I didn't expect a dying person

133
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,280
would make such a big fuss.

134
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,760
You just said

135
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,840
the body of a paranormal person

136
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,320
can be used to make medicine.

137
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,600
That's true.

138
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,680
That's what the book says.

139
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,280
Really?

140
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,680
It's time to practice.

141
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,280
Okay!

142
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:30,040
Since we have such good materials,

143
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:33,440
we can’t let her go.

144
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:36,840
Your Highness.

145
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,240
Looks like Shangguan has a new move.

146
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,560
Let's disperse his men.

147
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,080
he will fight back.

148
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:57,040
We don't know where the gold was sealed.

149
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,520
has probably known

150
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,760
the letter was leaked from us.

151
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:03,200
But he didn't tell Shangguan.

152
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:06,680
Maybe he wants to save Miss Ye.

153
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:09,520
He is so infatuated.

154
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,360
Shangguan received news from the Lion Guard.

155
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:14,720
to look for her.

156
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,320
but we still lack key information.

157
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:17,800
We're back on the same way.

158
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:18,840
Lion Guard.

159
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,880
It's the hidden army led by General Qin.

160
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,320
Yes.

161
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,040
But no one in the court has seen it.

162
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,800
I heard that this team only appears

163
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,040
when the country is in danger.

164
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:32,760
But no one knows

165
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,160
No one knows yet.

166
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,000
It seems that Shangguan wants to put an end to it.

167
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,880
Bad news. General Wang is in danger.

168
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:47,400
DongMo Chen, take the Ten Secret Guards to depart immediately.

169
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:49,240
Don't delay General Wang's matter.

170
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,200
No.

171
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,920
Just like old brothers.

172
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:54,920
Yes.

173
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,040
I don't have time to find my wish.

174
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,280
Tell her

175
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:02,240
to be careful when you don't know anything.

176
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:03,440
Yes.

177
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,240
How long does it take?

178
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:29,400
Why did she faint so long?

179
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:32,920
Leave her alone.

180
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,920
She'll probably be in shock.

181
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:38,400
Isn't that old man going to live?

182
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,000
Did he kill him with too much medicine?

183
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:46,120
Don't worry, that medicine won't kill anyone.

184
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,360
The old man is playing quite well now.

185
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:53,800
She might be tormented if she goes back.

186
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,400
When will she stay?

187
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:00,640
No, let's stay for one night.

188
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,280
Then find a place for her.
