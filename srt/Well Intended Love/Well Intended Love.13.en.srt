1
00:00:12,885 --> 00:00:16,445
Come bike with me. You'll get paid
handsomely at the end of the day.

2
00:00:16,685 --> 00:00:20,085
Am I glowing to you right now?

3
00:00:20,605 --> 00:00:21,565
I'm absolutely perfect.

4
00:00:25,925 --> 00:00:26,765
Ling?

5
00:00:26,845 --> 00:00:28,325
How's the investigation into Chu?

6
00:00:28,405 --> 00:00:29,965
Everything is pretty much in place.

7
00:00:31,005 --> 00:00:31,845
Set things in action.

8
00:00:33,365 --> 00:00:36,045
You rotten child.
If Ling Yizhou finds out,

9
00:00:36,125 --> 00:00:37,805
the Chu family's prosperity
will be ruined!

10
00:00:37,885 --> 00:00:41,605
My last name is not Chu. I don't want
to be a part of this family either.

11
00:00:41,965 --> 00:00:45,725
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

12
00:02:12,605 --> 00:02:15,565
EPISODE 13

13
00:02:16,445 --> 00:02:17,925
Xia Lin!

14
00:02:18,285 --> 00:02:19,445
Are you feeling better?

15
00:02:19,525 --> 00:02:21,605
I'm fine, but something
has happened to Chu Yan!

16
00:02:21,685 --> 00:02:22,925
Chu Yan? What happened?

17
00:02:23,885 --> 00:02:24,845
Look.

18
00:02:26,325 --> 00:02:28,245
FIRE AT HOSPITAL
STATUS OF CHU YAN UNKNOWN

19
00:02:30,605 --> 00:02:31,885
-I have to go!
-I'll come!

20
00:02:32,405 --> 00:02:33,245
No.

21
00:02:33,725 --> 00:02:36,405
-Take care of yourself. Bye.
-Please be careful!

22
00:02:40,765 --> 00:02:41,765
Thank you, Mr. Wang.

23
00:02:42,445 --> 00:02:43,445
I'll be off then.

24
00:02:43,805 --> 00:02:45,525
Come tomorrow to assist the investigation.

25
00:02:45,605 --> 00:02:46,445
OK.

26
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:48,685
MORGUE

27
00:02:55,805 --> 00:02:56,925
What happened to Chu Yan?

28
00:02:57,445 --> 00:02:59,965
The news said his room caught on fire.
Did he get hurt?

29
00:03:01,285 --> 00:03:03,245
Why are you here? Where is Chu Yan?

30
00:03:11,165 --> 00:03:12,045
Mumu...

31
00:03:13,965 --> 00:03:15,245
Chu Yan is gone.

32
00:03:21,245 --> 00:03:24,365
You... Since when are you
the type to joke?

33
00:03:26,565 --> 00:03:27,845
This isn't funny at all.

34
00:03:29,325 --> 00:03:30,245
I'm going to find him.

35
00:03:34,405 --> 00:03:35,445
It's true.

36
00:03:36,125 --> 00:03:37,765
The police are already investigating it.

37
00:03:43,885 --> 00:03:44,765
I don't believe it.

38
00:03:48,045 --> 00:03:49,405
There's no way!

39
00:03:51,805 --> 00:03:53,325
You're lying to me!

40
00:03:54,205 --> 00:03:55,885
I wish it wasn't true, too.

41
00:05:53,965 --> 00:05:54,965
Mumu...

42
00:05:55,965 --> 00:05:57,205
Why are you still here?

43
00:05:59,685 --> 00:06:03,845
I can't be alone today.

44
00:06:10,645 --> 00:06:13,445
I want to be closer to you.

45
00:06:14,165 --> 00:06:16,045
Then why didn't you say so?

46
00:06:17,245 --> 00:06:18,565
I didn't want it to be awkward.

47
00:06:19,725 --> 00:06:21,005
And I didn't want you to say no.

48
00:06:31,285 --> 00:06:34,725
Mumu, you're all I have now.

49
00:06:44,205 --> 00:06:45,525
I won't leave your side.

50
00:06:47,645 --> 00:06:51,285
Don't move. I want to say something.

51
00:06:53,925 --> 00:06:57,765
I've realized... life is so short.

52
00:06:59,205 --> 00:07:01,685
If I keep chasing after the past

53
00:07:02,205 --> 00:07:04,685
and hesitating, I'm just wasting my time.

54
00:07:06,845 --> 00:07:08,085
Since I still love you...

55
00:07:09,325 --> 00:07:12,645
there's nothing more important
than being with you.

56
00:07:14,725 --> 00:07:17,765
Because you never know what might happen.

57
00:07:19,085 --> 00:07:20,725
I don't want to regret anything.

58
00:07:28,045 --> 00:07:29,085
Thank you, Xia Lin.

59
00:07:30,325 --> 00:07:32,045
Thank you for coming back to me.

60
00:08:23,405 --> 00:08:24,925
WEN LI CALLING

61
00:08:29,445 --> 00:08:30,285
Hello?

62
00:08:34,565 --> 00:08:36,765
Mr. Ling, I apologize
for bothering you at this hour.

63
00:08:37,564 --> 00:08:38,405
It's fine.

64
00:08:38,725 --> 00:08:40,564
Mr. Wang, any new developments?

65
00:08:41,164 --> 00:08:44,325
Yes. The reason I'm here so late
is because I'd like to ask you

66
00:08:44,845 --> 00:08:47,245
whether you know of any women
close to the deceased?

67
00:08:48,125 --> 00:08:49,525
Did you find new evidence?

68
00:08:50,765 --> 00:08:53,205
I can't reveal any details
of an ongoing investigation.

69
00:08:54,045 --> 00:08:57,005
Mr. Wang, I need to know
the specifics of the situation

70
00:08:57,085 --> 00:08:59,245
to give you any useful information.

71
00:08:59,685 --> 00:09:02,885
Don't worry, I'll keep the details
of the case absolutely secret.

72
00:09:07,525 --> 00:09:08,925
The coroner's autopsy was released.

73
00:09:09,325 --> 00:09:11,485
Chu Yan was holding an earring
in his right hand.

74
00:09:12,485 --> 00:09:15,725
It's the most significant piece
of evidence from the scene so far.

75
00:09:16,285 --> 00:09:18,525
An earring? Can I see it?

76
00:09:19,085 --> 00:09:21,525
As per the law,
only immediate relatives of the deceased

77
00:09:21,605 --> 00:09:23,845
have the right to see relevant evidence.

78
00:09:25,645 --> 00:09:28,965
Chu Yan's father has asked Mr. Ling
to work with you on his behalf.

79
00:09:29,365 --> 00:09:31,965
From now on, Mr. Ling will answer
any questions you may have.

80
00:09:32,485 --> 00:09:35,445
Mr. Chu is currently hospitalized
due to a heart attack.

81
00:09:36,205 --> 00:09:38,365
Mr. Wang, you can go see him
if you have the time.

82
00:09:39,045 --> 00:09:41,445
Just don't excite or agitate him.

83
00:09:42,485 --> 00:09:45,885
Since Mr. Chu has authorized you, it's OK.

84
00:09:51,125 --> 00:09:52,085
This is the earring.

85
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:54,565
Does it look familiar, Mr. Ling?

86
00:10:03,965 --> 00:10:05,765
I'll get you a glass of water.

87
00:10:08,005 --> 00:10:12,005
I don't normally pay much attention
to women's accessories.

88
00:10:12,525 --> 00:10:14,285
So I'm afraid I might not be of any help.

89
00:10:15,845 --> 00:10:19,245
But I can provide you a list
of women close to Chu Yan.

90
00:10:22,405 --> 00:10:24,805
Thank you for your assistance.
We'll get going now.

91
00:10:24,885 --> 00:10:25,725
Of course.

92
00:10:25,805 --> 00:10:27,885
I was hardly any help, Mr. Wang.

93
00:10:28,125 --> 00:10:30,965
Please do let me know
of any further developments.

94
00:10:31,405 --> 00:10:33,845
I'll see if I can help you
with any additional information.

95
00:10:34,205 --> 00:10:37,285
Sure. You'll be the first to know
when we find the owner of the earring.

96
00:10:38,525 --> 00:10:39,365
Thank you.

97
00:10:46,245 --> 00:10:48,325
-Boss, you...
-Don't worry about it.

98
00:10:49,805 --> 00:10:50,645
I'll get going then.

99
00:11:05,285 --> 00:11:08,085
I just saw the police.
Has something happened?

100
00:11:08,445 --> 00:11:09,285
It's nothing.

101
00:11:09,645 --> 00:11:11,885
Mumu, did you lose an earring recently?

102
00:11:12,525 --> 00:11:15,125
I did lose one.
How do you know about that?

103
00:11:15,525 --> 00:11:17,605
Do you still have the other one?
Let me see it.

104
00:11:21,005 --> 00:11:23,725
It's this one. What's the matter?

105
00:11:29,285 --> 00:11:32,285
Mumu, were you wearing those
when you met Chu Yan before the fire?

106
00:11:34,085 --> 00:11:36,725
Yes, the day before he was hospitalized.

107
00:11:37,085 --> 00:11:38,325
That was the day I lost it.

108
00:11:40,765 --> 00:11:43,445
What does this have to do
with the incident?

109
00:11:43,885 --> 00:11:46,645
The cameras in the hospital
were disabled before the fire.

110
00:11:47,485 --> 00:11:49,805
That fire was not an accident.
Someone caused it on purpose.

111
00:11:50,965 --> 00:11:53,205
Are you saying
someone killed him on purpose?

112
00:11:54,885 --> 00:11:57,525
The police already have clues
pointing to an arsonist.

113
00:11:57,765 --> 00:11:58,885
What kind of clues?

114
00:12:02,725 --> 00:12:03,565
This earring.

115
00:12:04,845 --> 00:12:07,765
Me? How could that be?

116
00:12:08,205 --> 00:12:09,685
Your earring was in Chu Yan's hand.

117
00:12:10,805 --> 00:12:13,005
With no other evidence besides this...

118
00:12:13,965 --> 00:12:15,005
you are the main suspect.

119
00:12:15,485 --> 00:12:17,845
This has to be a joke.

120
00:12:18,325 --> 00:12:20,165
Why would I hurt Chu Yan?

121
00:12:20,605 --> 00:12:22,405
I know. This has nothing to do with you.

122
00:12:22,845 --> 00:12:24,925
Don't worry, Xia Lin.
I'll make sure you're OK.

123
00:12:28,205 --> 00:12:31,605
But why was my earring in Chu Yan's hand?

124
00:12:33,525 --> 00:12:34,885
If I ventured to guess,

125
00:12:35,645 --> 00:12:37,205
the person who plotted all this

126
00:12:37,285 --> 00:12:38,725
was not targeting Chu Yan...

127
00:12:40,325 --> 00:12:41,285
but you instead.

128
00:12:51,685 --> 00:12:53,925
UNKNOWN NUMBER:
DO YOU LIKE THE GIFT?

129
00:12:54,325 --> 00:12:55,325
Gift?

130
00:12:57,045 --> 00:13:00,285
Could it be the earring?

131
00:13:07,605 --> 00:13:08,805
I need you to track a number.

132
00:13:16,205 --> 00:13:18,485
This was where I met Chu Yan.

133
00:13:20,325 --> 00:13:22,045
Someone is leading us here.

134
00:13:26,565 --> 00:13:29,685
Mr. Ling, ten minutes of footage was wiped
from the surveillance cameras here.

135
00:13:30,005 --> 00:13:32,365
That was the exact same time
we got the text messages.

136
00:13:33,205 --> 00:13:34,405
How meticulous of them.

137
00:13:35,245 --> 00:13:36,845
We must have been led here for a reason.

138
00:13:54,605 --> 00:13:55,485
What is it?

139
00:13:59,365 --> 00:14:00,445
A photo.

140
00:14:08,485 --> 00:14:11,045
I was just holding him back!

141
00:14:11,125 --> 00:14:12,325
How did they get it like this?

142
00:14:12,405 --> 00:14:16,165
Xia Lin, who else was here
with you that day?

143
00:14:16,645 --> 00:14:19,165
Yang Tong and the driver
were waiting for me.

144
00:14:24,325 --> 00:14:25,685
With this picture,

145
00:14:26,525 --> 00:14:30,845
they will think
that I killed Chu Yan, right?

146
00:14:31,125 --> 00:14:32,245
I know it wasn't you.

147
00:14:33,765 --> 00:14:35,245
Let's get going.

148
00:14:42,805 --> 00:14:45,445
Mr. Wang, any news?

149
00:14:45,965 --> 00:14:47,405
Regarding Mr. Chu Yan's death,

150
00:14:47,485 --> 00:14:49,325
we'd like to ask
for Miss Xia's cooperation.

151
00:14:52,885 --> 00:14:55,325
Based on a single photo, Mr. Wang?

152
00:14:55,685 --> 00:14:56,725
It doesn't prove anything.

153
00:14:56,805 --> 00:14:58,005
We're just doing our duty.

154
00:14:58,365 --> 00:15:01,245
As a friend of Chu Yan,
you should also cooperate

155
00:15:01,325 --> 00:15:03,165
and avoid interfering
with our investigation.

156
00:15:03,405 --> 00:15:05,245
Investigating Xia Lin is a waste of time.

157
00:15:05,325 --> 00:15:07,245
You could use this time
to look for new leads.

158
00:15:08,285 --> 00:15:09,605
I'm willing to cooperate.

159
00:15:09,685 --> 00:15:12,205
Mr. Wang, we hope the police
can solve this case quickly.

160
00:15:12,285 --> 00:15:14,925
My innocence will be proved
when the real perpetrator is found.

161
00:15:15,005 --> 00:15:16,685
People close to him will also get closure.

162
00:15:16,925 --> 00:15:19,245
Thank you for your help.
I'll be waiting outside.

163
00:15:22,605 --> 00:15:25,045
Xia Lin, do you know
what you're stepping into?

164
00:15:25,485 --> 00:15:28,605
I do. I'll just think of it as field work.

165
00:15:28,965 --> 00:15:31,165
Maybe someday I'll be cast
in a detective series.

166
00:15:32,285 --> 00:15:33,445
Don't worry.

167
00:15:37,965 --> 00:15:41,525
Mr. Ling, when we were out there,
the photo was posted online.

168
00:15:42,125 --> 00:15:43,805
We're already checking the IP address.

169
00:15:44,125 --> 00:15:44,965
Let's go then.

170
00:15:47,805 --> 00:15:48,965
I put the notes on your desk.

171
00:15:49,045 --> 00:15:50,405
-Xia Lin.
-Tongtong.

172
00:15:50,485 --> 00:15:51,565
What are you doing here?

173
00:15:51,645 --> 00:15:52,645
They asked me about you.

174
00:15:53,125 --> 00:15:55,645
I don't know what's going on.
I just told them what happened.

175
00:15:57,965 --> 00:15:58,925
It's standard procedure.

176
00:15:59,525 --> 00:16:01,045
Miss Yang, you may go now.

177
00:16:02,405 --> 00:16:04,125
You'll be OK, right?

178
00:16:05,645 --> 00:16:07,525
Don't worry. You should go now.

179
00:16:14,205 --> 00:16:16,685
Based on surveillance footage
outside Yang Tong's apartment,

180
00:16:16,765 --> 00:16:19,765
you left the apartment between
seven and eight o'clock last night.

181
00:16:20,965 --> 00:16:22,445
I went to buy some food.

182
00:16:22,685 --> 00:16:24,165
Can anyone verify that?

183
00:16:25,045 --> 00:16:27,925
The lady who sold me the food
gave me 20RMB in change.

184
00:16:28,285 --> 00:16:29,485
She probably remembers me.

185
00:16:31,045 --> 00:16:31,965
Who else?

186
00:16:32,685 --> 00:16:36,125
I chatted with the girl
who sells brown sugar water.

187
00:16:36,845 --> 00:16:39,205
A girl? How old was she?

188
00:16:40,085 --> 00:16:43,965
She was about this tall,
probably seven or eight years old.

189
00:16:45,285 --> 00:16:47,525
Is there anyone else old enough
to give us a testimony?

190
00:16:47,965 --> 00:16:50,845
I also ran into a man walking his dog
outside the market.

191
00:16:51,325 --> 00:16:53,565
But I don't know if he'll be back there.

192
00:16:54,445 --> 00:16:57,685
Ms. Xia, the entirety of this conversation
will be on the record.

193
00:16:58,245 --> 00:16:59,525
I do hope you act accordingly.

194
00:17:00,845 --> 00:17:03,765
Sir, I'm more concerned
about this case than anyone else.

195
00:17:03,845 --> 00:17:05,365
I want to know who hurt Chu Yan.

196
00:17:06,085 --> 00:17:09,165
I don't understand why you're so hung up
on me buying groceries.

197
00:17:09,604 --> 00:17:10,925
What's that have to do with it?

198
00:17:11,965 --> 00:17:15,885
You were away from the apartment
when the fire started at the hospital.

199
00:17:20,485 --> 00:17:25,245
You think I went to the hospital,
not the store?

200
00:17:26,925 --> 00:17:29,725
Your whereabouts fit the case perfectly.

201
00:17:31,885 --> 00:17:34,405
Mr. Wang, Mr. Ling has arrived
with new evidence.

202
00:17:35,005 --> 00:17:35,845
Got it.

203
00:17:39,845 --> 00:17:40,725
Mr. Wang.

204
00:17:41,445 --> 00:17:43,045
Mr. Ling has come to provide evidence.

205
00:17:43,485 --> 00:17:44,885
Mr. Wang, don't you think that

206
00:17:44,965 --> 00:17:47,285
there's something odd
about that picture online?

207
00:17:48,245 --> 00:17:50,125
We've already examined the photo

208
00:17:50,205 --> 00:17:51,605
and confirmed it is genuine.

209
00:17:52,045 --> 00:17:53,365
Yes, it's genuine.

210
00:17:53,645 --> 00:17:55,285
But choosing to shoot from that angle?

211
00:17:57,045 --> 00:17:58,085
What do you mean?

212
00:18:00,085 --> 00:18:01,085
Mr. Wang,

213
00:18:01,165 --> 00:18:03,405
this is the IP address
of whoever posted that photo.

214
00:18:06,565 --> 00:18:08,085
IP ADDRESS REPORT

215
00:18:09,325 --> 00:18:10,165
Someone abroad?

216
00:18:11,165 --> 00:18:13,005
They deliberately used an untraceable IP.

217
00:18:14,005 --> 00:18:17,085
It's clear someone was prepared
and waiting for a chance to strike.

218
00:18:18,085 --> 00:18:19,485
This IP address alone

219
00:18:19,565 --> 00:18:21,685
cannot prove that Miss Xia was framed.

220
00:18:24,205 --> 00:18:26,965
We found the location
through this cell phone.

221
00:18:27,885 --> 00:18:30,445
The picture was taken with this phone.

222
00:18:30,805 --> 00:18:33,005
All the security footage
from that day was wiped.

223
00:18:33,605 --> 00:18:35,765
Do you find that suspicious, Mr. Wang?

224
00:18:36,765 --> 00:18:39,725
Mr. Ling, what are you implying?

225
00:18:41,005 --> 00:18:42,325
I'd like to post Xia Lin's bail.

226
00:18:48,645 --> 00:18:50,645
Miss Xia, could you explain this photo?

227
00:18:50,725 --> 00:18:52,645
-Are you here as a suspect?
-Please, excuse us.

228
00:18:52,725 --> 00:18:54,285
-Ling Yizhou?
-Let's head home, Mumu.

229
00:18:54,365 --> 00:18:55,765
Please talk to us.

230
00:18:56,085 --> 00:18:57,565
-Don't worry.
-Miss Xia, explain.

231
00:18:57,645 --> 00:18:59,845
-A few words.
-Miss Xia, please explain.

232
00:19:02,965 --> 00:19:04,845
-Anything you'd like to say?
-I'm Ling Yizhou.

233
00:19:05,405 --> 00:19:08,165
Miss Xia and I were very close to Chu Yan.

234
00:19:08,245 --> 00:19:11,165
There's no way we would have harmed him.

235
00:19:11,565 --> 00:19:13,605
The case is still under investigation.

236
00:19:13,685 --> 00:19:15,565
Please be careful
with your words and actions.

237
00:19:15,885 --> 00:19:19,325
If anything slanderous or libelous
is said about Miss Xia,

238
00:19:19,405 --> 00:19:22,245
I will not hesitate
to pursue full legal remedy.

239
00:19:22,765 --> 00:19:23,605
Let's go.

240
00:19:24,125 --> 00:19:25,005
Please step back.

241
00:19:26,005 --> 00:19:27,805
-Anything else, please?
-Mr. Ling!

242
00:19:31,045 --> 00:19:32,085
I'm sorry.

243
00:19:33,085 --> 00:19:36,445
The first public appearance
of the CEO of Lingshi Group

244
00:19:36,925 --> 00:19:38,245
is at a police station.

245
00:19:39,805 --> 00:19:43,525
No problem.
I love being in public with my wife.

246
00:19:47,365 --> 00:19:48,205
Let's go.

247
00:20:17,805 --> 00:20:19,525
You killed my son.

248
00:20:20,245 --> 00:20:22,565
How dare you come here? Get out!

249
00:20:24,565 --> 00:20:25,525
Mr. Chu.

250
00:20:25,965 --> 00:20:28,325
I understand you are in pain
because you lost your son.

251
00:20:29,765 --> 00:20:31,325
But please watch your words.

252
00:20:31,805 --> 00:20:35,005
Ling Yizhou, you connived
your way to my signature

253
00:20:35,085 --> 00:20:36,685
just to cover for her!

254
00:20:39,765 --> 00:20:41,725
Mr. Chu, we are so sorry for your loss.

255
00:20:42,085 --> 00:20:44,565
I know that you won't believe
anything we say right now.

256
00:20:45,085 --> 00:20:46,165
I won't try to explain.

257
00:20:47,405 --> 00:20:48,365
I just hope that

258
00:20:49,045 --> 00:20:51,565
whoever killed Chu Yan
will be found as soon as possible...

259
00:20:52,605 --> 00:20:54,205
and handled according to the law.

260
00:20:54,965 --> 00:20:57,325
Ever since Chu Yan chose you over me...

261
00:20:58,685 --> 00:21:00,685
I knew you'd hurt him sooner or later.

262
00:21:01,805 --> 00:21:05,325
You're the reason all this happened!

263
00:21:06,245 --> 00:21:07,085
I...

264
00:21:09,085 --> 00:21:11,085
Our condolences, Mr. Chu.

265
00:21:11,805 --> 00:21:12,765
We'll get going.

266
00:21:19,205 --> 00:21:21,525
Why did he say that I'd hurt Chu Yan?

267
00:21:21,605 --> 00:21:23,765
The anger of an elderly man.
Don't take it personally.

268
00:21:24,765 --> 00:21:26,245
Mr. Ling, Mrs. Ling.

269
00:21:28,405 --> 00:21:29,725
I'll wait for you in the car.

270
00:21:34,085 --> 00:21:36,325
-What is it?
-After we left the scene of the crime,

271
00:21:36,405 --> 00:21:38,845
I had a private investigator
look into Yang Tong's background.

272
00:21:38,925 --> 00:21:40,805
There are some major discrepancies.

273
00:21:42,045 --> 00:21:43,285
We'll pay her a visit shortly.

274
00:21:43,365 --> 00:21:44,205
Yes, sir.

275
00:21:50,525 --> 00:21:51,365
An Ran?

276
00:21:52,485 --> 00:21:53,805
Are you surprised to see me here?

277
00:21:54,245 --> 00:21:55,925
If the main suspect is allowed to attend,

278
00:21:56,525 --> 00:21:58,885
is it so surprising
that his good friend does, too?

279
00:22:00,525 --> 00:22:02,925
Whether you come or not
has nothing to do with me.

280
00:22:04,085 --> 00:22:05,125
Nothing to do with you?

281
00:22:06,605 --> 00:22:09,845
The spirit of Chu Yan would feel
very hurt about that.

282
00:22:10,285 --> 00:22:11,165
What do you mean?

283
00:22:12,045 --> 00:22:15,445
He had a fallout with his father
all because of you.

284
00:22:16,045 --> 00:22:17,285
What could that mean

285
00:22:17,845 --> 00:22:19,165
other than that he loved you?

286
00:22:19,245 --> 00:22:20,725
That's impossible. Watch yourself.

287
00:22:21,325 --> 00:22:24,405
You pretended to be unaware of it
while he was alive.

288
00:22:25,365 --> 00:22:26,925
Now that he's gone,

289
00:22:27,445 --> 00:22:30,205
can you live with a clear conscience?

290
00:22:31,725 --> 00:22:33,245
I don't care what you say.

291
00:22:33,885 --> 00:22:36,765
Chu Yan was our friend.
That will always be true.

292
00:22:37,325 --> 00:22:38,365
The death of Chu Yan

293
00:22:38,645 --> 00:22:42,365
is an immeasurable loss to me
and everyone who loved and supported him.

294
00:22:43,125 --> 00:22:45,085
We are all grieving him.

295
00:22:45,605 --> 00:22:47,045
All I can do now

296
00:22:47,285 --> 00:22:49,725
is live with the memories of him.

297
00:22:50,325 --> 00:22:53,285
I'm positive that's what
Chu Yan would want to see.

298
00:22:54,125 --> 00:22:55,125
-You're--
-Mumu.

299
00:23:03,005 --> 00:23:05,125
Something came up,
so I can't drive you home.

300
00:23:05,205 --> 00:23:06,365
I've arranged your driver.

301
00:23:06,685 --> 00:23:07,965
Is it about the case?

302
00:23:08,325 --> 00:23:09,805
No, it's just work.

303
00:23:10,805 --> 00:23:13,245
OK, go do your thing.
Don't worry about me.

304
00:23:13,605 --> 00:23:15,205
-Go home and wait for me.
-Alright.

305
00:23:38,845 --> 00:23:41,765
Miss, are you following
your boyfriend or husband?

306
00:23:42,405 --> 00:23:43,445
Husband.

307
00:23:43,725 --> 00:23:45,245
Is he having an affair?

308
00:23:45,325 --> 00:23:47,685
An affair? Is this how you talk?

309
00:23:49,085 --> 00:23:52,485
When wives act like this,
nine out of ten times it's an affair.

310
00:23:53,485 --> 00:23:55,805
You're quite experienced
in this matter, aren't you?

311
00:23:55,885 --> 00:23:57,325
My husband isn't having an affair.

312
00:23:58,725 --> 00:23:59,805
Miss!

313
00:24:00,405 --> 00:24:02,005
I'm sure he's my husband.

314
00:24:02,365 --> 00:24:03,285
The taxi fare.

315
00:24:14,565 --> 00:24:17,085
Mr. Ling, Xia Lin isn't here with you?

316
00:24:17,525 --> 00:24:18,365
She's busy.

317
00:24:19,805 --> 00:24:22,325
What is this all about?

318
00:24:23,765 --> 00:24:24,925
You took that photo.

319
00:24:26,205 --> 00:24:27,045
No, I didn't.

320
00:24:27,445 --> 00:24:30,405
-Why would I do that to hurt Xia Lin?
-You can drop the act.

321
00:24:31,925 --> 00:24:34,925
I know you're not capable
of doing something like this on your own.

322
00:24:35,845 --> 00:24:38,845
Tell me who you're working for,
and I'll let it slide.

323
00:24:39,445 --> 00:24:41,885
Mr. Ling,
I really didn't take that picture.

324
00:24:42,685 --> 00:24:44,205
I was in the car the whole time.

325
00:24:44,285 --> 00:24:46,565
The driver can attest to that.

326
00:24:46,645 --> 00:24:49,005
You know that the driver
has already disappeared.

327
00:24:49,365 --> 00:24:50,805
That's why you're saying that.

328
00:24:52,165 --> 00:24:54,725
Mr. Ling, I really don't know
anything about it.

329
00:24:56,285 --> 00:24:59,445
I'll give you a chance to prove yourself.

330
00:25:00,165 --> 00:25:03,645
From 2015 to 2017,

331
00:25:03,885 --> 00:25:05,925
where did you live
and what were you doing?

332
00:25:08,125 --> 00:25:11,925
Sir, I'm just a girl from the countryside.

333
00:25:12,365 --> 00:25:14,445
You know from that day
what my family is like.

334
00:25:14,885 --> 00:25:16,565
You know everything already.

335
00:25:17,005 --> 00:25:18,445
If you're still suspicious,

336
00:25:18,765 --> 00:25:20,485
I'll have to explain everything
to Xia Lin.

337
00:25:26,005 --> 00:25:27,965
I encourage you
to make things a little clearer.

338
00:25:28,565 --> 00:25:30,005
I'm not Xia Lin.

339
00:25:30,405 --> 00:25:32,045
I have no sympathy towards you.

340
00:25:40,605 --> 00:25:41,445
Mumu.

341
00:25:41,685 --> 00:25:44,165
Xia Lin, please talk
some sense into Mr. Ling.

342
00:25:44,245 --> 00:25:46,685
He thinks I helped someone frame you.

343
00:25:48,125 --> 00:25:49,525
You're interrogating her?

344
00:25:49,805 --> 00:25:51,925
I deserve to be consulted
for something like this.

345
00:25:52,005 --> 00:25:53,565
You wouldn't have the heart to do it.

346
00:25:54,165 --> 00:25:57,525
I might not be as cunning as you,

347
00:25:58,085 --> 00:25:59,765
but I'm not an idiot.

348
00:26:01,605 --> 00:26:02,445
Xia Lin.

349
00:26:04,485 --> 00:26:06,805
Yang Tong, tell me the truth.

350
00:26:07,805 --> 00:26:09,365
Did you have anything to do with this?

351
00:26:09,645 --> 00:26:10,485
No.

352
00:26:14,885 --> 00:26:16,485
When I first saw you...

353
00:26:17,685 --> 00:26:20,685
I thought,
"This girl is really something."

354
00:26:21,645 --> 00:26:24,845
Living all by herself
out in the middle of nowhere...

355
00:26:25,765 --> 00:26:28,205
chopping wood,
starting fires, and cooking food.

356
00:26:28,885 --> 00:26:30,765
Even cultivating fruit trees
on the mountain.

357
00:26:31,045 --> 00:26:32,485
But I gradually realized...

358
00:26:34,245 --> 00:26:35,525
that your hands

359
00:26:35,925 --> 00:26:38,165
are not hands
that have done real country labor.

360
00:26:39,285 --> 00:26:41,205
Even writers get callouses...

361
00:26:42,285 --> 00:26:45,285
not to say someone who chops wood
with an axe every day.

362
00:26:48,765 --> 00:26:49,725
What do you think?

363
00:26:51,965 --> 00:26:54,645
Xia Lin, I'm so sorry.

364
00:26:55,445 --> 00:26:56,725
I lied to you.

365
00:26:57,365 --> 00:26:59,805
I just wanted
to find a good job in the city.

366
00:27:00,925 --> 00:27:04,005
I didn't want to live a life
like that anymore.

367
00:27:06,325 --> 00:27:07,965
That's what I told myself at first.

368
00:27:09,165 --> 00:27:11,685
I saw nothing else suspicious,

369
00:27:12,085 --> 00:27:13,925
so I let my guard down around you.

370
00:27:14,565 --> 00:27:17,285
But I have no choice now.

371
00:27:20,365 --> 00:27:21,205
Please!

372
00:27:23,245 --> 00:27:24,765
Believe me just this once!

373
00:27:24,845 --> 00:27:26,205
Just once!

374
00:27:26,285 --> 00:27:28,645
I beg you...

375
00:27:29,845 --> 00:27:30,765
After this incident,

376
00:27:31,565 --> 00:27:33,405
regardless of whether
you were involved or not,

377
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:35,725
I can't keep you by my side anymore.

378
00:27:36,805 --> 00:27:37,725
Moreover...

379
00:27:39,965 --> 00:27:40,885
I trust Ling Yizhou.

380
00:27:42,605 --> 00:27:44,325
He would not suspect you without reason.

381
00:27:47,485 --> 00:27:50,365
You can't blame all this on me

382
00:27:50,685 --> 00:27:52,565
just because I told one lie.

383
00:27:54,285 --> 00:27:55,885
Think about it, Xia Lin.

384
00:27:56,685 --> 00:27:58,365
I've been with you for so long.

385
00:27:59,125 --> 00:28:01,005
I've never done anything to hurt you!

386
00:28:01,645 --> 00:28:03,485
You were waiting for an opportunity.

387
00:28:04,965 --> 00:28:06,725
You've never had cramps like that before.

388
00:28:07,365 --> 00:28:10,205
But you suddenly did after we went
to see Chu Yan at the hospital.

389
00:28:11,005 --> 00:28:13,565
And we ran out of brown sugar water,
so I had to go get some.

390
00:28:14,805 --> 00:28:16,925
It all seems like quite the coincidence.

391
00:28:17,245 --> 00:28:19,885
You pushed me into a trap step by step.

392
00:28:21,205 --> 00:28:22,165
Isn't that right?

393
00:28:29,405 --> 00:28:32,365
If you still cherish the bond
we've created over all this time,

394
00:28:32,765 --> 00:28:35,965
you'll tell me who's behind all this.

395
00:28:37,005 --> 00:28:39,325
I promise I won't hold
you responsible for any of it.

396
00:28:40,485 --> 00:28:41,565
If you don't tell me...

397
00:28:43,365 --> 00:28:44,845
I'll have to hand you over to them.

398
00:28:48,285 --> 00:28:50,725
OK. I'll talk.

399
00:28:51,325 --> 00:28:53,045
It... It was An Ran.

400
00:29:04,405 --> 00:29:05,805
An Ran paid me

401
00:29:05,885 --> 00:29:07,605
to keep an eye on you and Chu Yan.

402
00:29:08,205 --> 00:29:10,605
I sent the picture to her that day.

403
00:29:11,325 --> 00:29:14,125
Then I found your earring
in the hospital room.

404
00:29:14,485 --> 00:29:17,125
When she found out about it,
she told me to stall you.

405
00:29:22,245 --> 00:29:23,085
What is it?

406
00:29:26,965 --> 00:29:28,405
Do you believe Yang Tong?

407
00:29:30,965 --> 00:29:34,365
As soon as this happened,
An Ran was the first person I looked into,

408
00:29:35,165 --> 00:29:36,285
but I didn't find anything.

409
00:29:36,965 --> 00:29:38,805
If she's lying...

410
00:29:39,725 --> 00:29:41,405
why would she put it all on An Ran?

411
00:29:43,685 --> 00:29:45,285
That's what I can't figure out, either.

412
00:29:46,325 --> 00:29:47,405
Didn't you say that

413
00:29:47,485 --> 00:29:50,365
the person behind this was after me,
not Chu Yan?

414
00:29:51,165 --> 00:29:52,645
An Ran does hate me.

415
00:29:53,085 --> 00:29:55,765
She had the means and the motive, but...

416
00:29:56,565 --> 00:29:57,925
I still don't get it.

417
00:29:58,405 --> 00:30:00,165
How could she be so cruel to Chu Yan?

418
00:30:04,045 --> 00:30:06,725
Go get some rest.
I still need to take care of some things.

419
00:30:15,205 --> 00:30:17,445
He never lets me see him sad.

420
00:30:22,805 --> 00:30:23,685
Hello.

421
00:30:24,325 --> 00:30:26,005
I need to find out where someone is.

422
00:30:26,685 --> 00:30:27,605
Be discrete about it.

423
00:30:38,805 --> 00:30:39,645
Hello?

424
00:30:39,845 --> 00:30:41,965
<i>Hey, Linlin. I don't have internet here.</i>

425
00:30:42,045 --> 00:30:44,205
<i>I just saw the news. Where are you?</i>

426
00:30:44,685 --> 00:30:46,325
I'm at Ling Yizhou's.

427
00:30:46,725 --> 00:30:48,645
<i>Wait for me. I'll be back soon.</i>

428
00:30:48,725 --> 00:30:50,125
I'm fine, you don't need to...

429
00:30:53,445 --> 00:30:54,925
She's so hotheaded.

430
00:30:55,965 --> 00:30:58,165
Right, the news.

431
00:31:02,285 --> 00:31:04,445
-LING YIZHOU ABANDONED BRO FOR A GIRL
-BOYCOTT LINGSHI!

432
00:31:04,885 --> 00:31:07,765
You people know nothing about him,
how dare you say that?

433
00:31:12,485 --> 00:31:17,045
No, defending him like this
will only make things worse.

434
00:31:21,765 --> 00:31:24,445
WEIBO USERNAME: THERE'S ONLY ONE TRUTH

435
00:31:24,525 --> 00:31:27,205
BIO: DETECTIVE JIMMY KUDO

436
00:31:30,685 --> 00:31:32,565
<i>Ling Yizhou has been possessed!</i>

437
00:31:32,645 --> 00:31:37,205
<i>Ling has an IQ of 146. Even possessed,</i>
<i>he would be smarter than a normal person.</i>

438
00:31:37,285 --> 00:31:39,285
<i>Ling Yizhou is giving up on himself.</i>

439
00:31:39,605 --> 00:31:42,125
Giving up on himself?

440
00:31:50,125 --> 00:31:55,245
Giving up on the old me
brings out a new and better me!

441
00:31:56,325 --> 00:31:59,325
You guys should read more.

442
00:32:14,205 --> 00:32:16,765
Boss, as of eleven o'clock this morning,

443
00:32:17,165 --> 00:32:19,845
all shopping centers, supermarkets,
and stores in the Lingshi Group

444
00:32:19,925 --> 00:32:21,245
have seen a minor drop in revenue.

445
00:32:21,885 --> 00:32:24,205
A further decline is anticipated.

446
00:32:26,245 --> 00:32:29,005
Give me a revenue analysis
at the end of each day.

447
00:32:29,085 --> 00:32:32,005
Push forward scheduled renovations
for our all stores.

448
00:32:32,765 --> 00:32:35,565
We can take this opportunity
to get rid of some brands in those stores.

449
00:32:35,645 --> 00:32:36,485
Yes, sir.

450
00:32:49,125 --> 00:32:51,765
Alright, thank you.

451
00:32:52,725 --> 00:32:54,165
Notify me immediately of any news.

452
00:32:58,005 --> 00:32:58,845
Anything else?

453
00:32:59,965 --> 00:33:03,525
Boss, people online are talking
about how you bailed out your wife.

454
00:33:04,205 --> 00:33:05,685
It's all very negative coverage.

455
00:33:07,165 --> 00:33:09,885
Don't bother telling me this.
Let PR handle it.

456
00:33:10,485 --> 00:33:12,725
Someone has acted faster than PR.

457
00:33:16,605 --> 00:33:17,525
I'll get going then.

458
00:33:46,445 --> 00:33:47,285
Hello.

459
00:33:48,445 --> 00:33:49,685
What are you up to?

460
00:33:50,365 --> 00:33:52,405
I'm... I'm reading.

461
00:33:52,925 --> 00:33:53,765
Is that so?

462
00:33:55,245 --> 00:33:58,885
I was worried you'd seen
the comments online and felt bad.

463
00:33:59,565 --> 00:34:00,765
You've see them, too?

464
00:34:00,845 --> 00:34:01,805
<i>Yep.</i>

465
00:34:02,725 --> 00:34:06,285
I guess this is what
Internet outrage is like. Now I know.

466
00:34:06,965 --> 00:34:09,685
A bunch of strangers running their mouths,
it's not worth reading.

467
00:34:09,765 --> 00:34:13,724
It's very smart of you
to never use social media.

468
00:34:15,085 --> 00:34:19,325
I do keep seeing a certain user called
There's Only One Truth speaking up for me.

469
00:34:19,965 --> 00:34:21,724
Don't waste your time on all that garbage.

470
00:34:21,805 --> 00:34:24,565
Get your work done. I've got to go, bye.

471
00:34:30,365 --> 00:34:34,244
Are there cameras in here?

472
00:34:47,684 --> 00:34:49,565
I'm working hard on the script.

473
00:34:50,045 --> 00:34:53,845
I thought Chu Yan could play
the main male character.

474
00:34:54,445 --> 00:34:58,085
And now... now he's gone, just like that.

475
00:34:59,285 --> 00:35:01,684
I still can't believe
what happened to Chu Yan.

476
00:35:03,245 --> 00:35:05,005
It doesn't feel real.

477
00:35:08,165 --> 00:35:10,125
You just can't get rid of that An Ran.

478
00:35:10,205 --> 00:35:12,085
With a pretty princess face like hers,

479
00:35:12,325 --> 00:35:14,005
how can she be so heartless?

480
00:35:15,645 --> 00:35:17,205
Right now, I suspect that

481
00:35:17,885 --> 00:35:21,525
she also arranged for me
to go to that interview at the bar.

482
00:35:22,845 --> 00:35:23,965
That's possible.

483
00:35:24,045 --> 00:35:27,525
Last time it was you and Chu Yan,
and she failed.

484
00:35:28,445 --> 00:35:29,885
This time she upped her game,

485
00:35:30,325 --> 00:35:33,645
smearing you,
and bringing Mr. Ling into it, too.

486
00:35:35,485 --> 00:35:37,445
That's like killing three birds
with one stone.

487
00:35:38,285 --> 00:35:42,205
I've already destroyed
Ling Yizhou's reputation as it is.

488
00:35:43,205 --> 00:35:45,245
I can't even bring myself
to see his grandma.

489
00:35:47,685 --> 00:35:50,725
He's quite the <i>homme fatal</i>.

490
00:35:51,245 --> 00:35:53,325
An Ran's love was unrequited,

491
00:35:53,405 --> 00:35:56,845
so you and Chu Yan had to suffer for it.

492
00:35:58,765 --> 00:36:02,885
Why did it have to be so tragic
for my dear Chu Yan?

493
00:36:03,525 --> 00:36:04,525
Miss Jia, you're here.

494
00:36:06,805 --> 00:36:08,525
Why are you back so early?

495
00:36:09,085 --> 00:36:10,325
I wanted to be with you.

496
00:36:12,045 --> 00:36:14,085
I'm going to use the restroom.

497
00:36:21,525 --> 00:36:22,365
What is it?

498
00:36:24,045 --> 00:36:24,885
Nothing.

499
00:36:29,485 --> 00:36:30,325
Are you avoiding me?

500
00:36:31,045 --> 00:36:32,485
Why would I do that?

501
00:36:32,565 --> 00:36:35,725
I've been working myself to death.
I haven't had the time to avoid you.

502
00:36:36,205 --> 00:36:38,045
-Get over yourself.
-We need to talk.

503
00:36:39,125 --> 00:36:40,805
-I'm busy.
-You had time to kiss me!

504
00:36:43,925 --> 00:36:47,085
I mistook you for my idol.

505
00:36:47,605 --> 00:36:48,845
I kissed the wrong guy, OK?

506
00:36:49,125 --> 00:36:50,605
You can't just kiss people like that.

507
00:36:51,765 --> 00:36:56,005
Fine, we kissed.
Why are you upset about it?

508
00:36:56,285 --> 00:36:57,885
Are you my parent or my boyfriend?

509
00:36:58,365 --> 00:36:59,205
Jia Fei.

510
00:37:00,765 --> 00:37:02,205
Wen Li, come with me.

511
00:37:02,285 --> 00:37:03,125
Yes, sir.

512
00:37:06,445 --> 00:37:09,605
What's up with you two?

513
00:37:10,005 --> 00:37:11,325
Don't ask about it.

514
00:37:11,405 --> 00:37:13,485
Wen Li is a ticking time bomb.

515
00:37:13,565 --> 00:37:14,565
I need to move out.

516
00:37:14,645 --> 00:37:16,085
You need to take me in, OK?

517
00:37:16,325 --> 00:37:18,845
Save me, or I'm done for.

518
00:37:20,645 --> 00:37:22,005
What's going on at the company?

519
00:37:23,605 --> 00:37:26,445
Chu Yan's fans have blocked
the main entrance.

520
00:37:26,845 --> 00:37:29,005
They say you're using your influence
to break the law

521
00:37:29,085 --> 00:37:31,085
and cover up the fact
that your wife killed Chu Yan.

522
00:37:32,605 --> 00:37:34,445
I haven't even dealt with the slander

523
00:37:34,525 --> 00:37:35,965
and they go and start a riot,

524
00:37:36,565 --> 00:37:37,845
coming right to our front door.

525
00:37:39,205 --> 00:37:42,085
Notify the Ministry of Justice.
Make sure they hear from our lawyers.

526
00:37:42,805 --> 00:37:44,365
Understood. Oh, yes...

527
00:37:44,765 --> 00:37:48,205
The board has taken great interest
in rumors about you and your wife lately.

528
00:37:48,485 --> 00:37:51,885
If we can't keep it under control,
they might be alarmed.

529
00:37:55,205 --> 00:37:56,725
Prepare a press conference for me.

530
00:37:57,925 --> 00:38:01,365
It's time... for some things to go public.

531
00:38:02,405 --> 00:38:03,245
Yes, sir.

532
00:38:09,125 --> 00:38:14,525
LINGSHI GROUP PRESS CONFERENCE

533
00:38:15,045 --> 00:38:17,165
Good afternoon
to all our friends in the media.

534
00:38:17,565 --> 00:38:20,085
Welcome to
the Lingshi Group press conference.

535
00:38:20,445 --> 00:38:22,285
What is the main purpose
of this conference?

536
00:38:22,365 --> 00:38:23,925
Is it related to Miss Xia?

537
00:38:24,205 --> 00:38:25,325
Please be patient.

538
00:38:25,805 --> 00:38:28,485
You were invited here
for two main announcements.

539
00:38:29,045 --> 00:38:30,205
Two announcements?

540
00:38:30,805 --> 00:38:33,005
Why did Ling Yizhou
not even tell me one of them?

541
00:38:34,405 --> 00:38:35,565
Just keep listening.

542
00:38:35,645 --> 00:38:36,605
First announcement.

543
00:38:37,045 --> 00:38:40,365
Mr. Ling Yizhou, Director of
Lingshi Group, and Miss Xia Lin

544
00:38:40,685 --> 00:38:43,485
were legally married on February 25, 2018.

545
00:38:45,045 --> 00:38:48,765
Is he insane? How could he go public
with our relationship right now?

546
00:38:48,845 --> 00:38:51,005
Mr. Ling is too slick.

547
00:38:51,525 --> 00:38:53,485
No wonder I've been a fan for so long.

548
00:38:53,565 --> 00:38:55,765
Why wait so long to reveal the marriage?

549
00:38:56,165 --> 00:38:57,565
Why is Mr. Ling not present?

550
00:38:57,965 --> 00:38:59,525
Is it because of the Chu Yan case?

551
00:39:00,165 --> 00:39:01,165
Could you explain?

552
00:39:01,245 --> 00:39:02,525
Please explain.

553
00:39:02,925 --> 00:39:04,685
Please elaborate. Just a word or two!

554
00:39:06,165 --> 00:39:07,005
Please explain.

555
00:39:08,125 --> 00:39:09,125
Please explain everything.

556
00:39:12,965 --> 00:39:16,725
I am just as curious as you all are.

557
00:39:17,965 --> 00:39:20,245
We'll wait for my husband to arrive.

558
00:39:20,485 --> 00:39:21,685
He'll explain everything.

559
00:39:21,765 --> 00:39:23,885
I can give everyone an answer.

560
00:39:24,205 --> 00:39:26,125
Isn't that An Ran
of Xing An Entertainment?

561
00:39:26,485 --> 00:39:28,805
Didn't she disappear a while ago?
What is she doing here?

562
00:39:37,445 --> 00:39:38,965
Yang Tong, you traitor!

563
00:39:47,445 --> 00:39:48,325
Hello, everyone.

564
00:39:49,045 --> 00:39:52,965
I'm here today to reveal the truth
about this Mrs. Ling

565
00:39:53,565 --> 00:39:57,165
so that my dear friend Chu Yan
may finally rest in peace.

566
00:40:05,005 --> 00:40:05,845
What is the truth?

567
00:40:07,245 --> 00:40:09,965
Hello, everyone.
I'm Mrs. Ling's assistant.

568
00:40:10,285 --> 00:40:11,405
I am here to identify...

569
00:40:12,325 --> 00:40:15,965
Mrs. Ling as Chu Yan's murderer.

570
00:40:18,645 --> 00:40:20,325
Yang Tong, I was so lenient towards you.

571
00:40:20,405 --> 00:40:21,925
Why would you backstab me like this?

572
00:40:22,685 --> 00:40:23,765
What proof do you have?

573
00:40:25,165 --> 00:40:27,965
I was there the day
she went to see Chu Yan.

574
00:40:28,605 --> 00:40:30,885
I saw her argue with Chu Yan.

575
00:40:31,205 --> 00:40:33,605
She almost pushed him into the water.

576
00:40:34,325 --> 00:40:35,645
I felt it was unfair to Chu Yan,

577
00:40:36,525 --> 00:40:39,925
so I took the photo and posted it online.

578
00:40:41,405 --> 00:40:43,525
But this only makes Mrs. Ling a suspect.

579
00:40:43,605 --> 00:40:45,565
That doesn't mean she's the murderer.

580
00:40:45,645 --> 00:40:47,525
Yeah. That's right.

581
00:40:47,605 --> 00:40:49,125
You can't prove anything.

582
00:40:49,485 --> 00:40:50,805
I prepared a video clip.

583
00:40:51,245 --> 00:40:53,045
You'll understand after you watch it.

584
00:41:01,045 --> 00:41:02,525
What? How could this be?

585
00:41:02,885 --> 00:41:05,565
Are you filming? Quick, run the camera.

586
00:41:07,765 --> 00:41:08,925
That is certainly evidence.

587
00:41:14,845 --> 00:41:16,285
So you're the one who framed me.

588
00:41:18,725 --> 00:41:21,605
Xia Lin feared her illicit relations
with Chu Yan would come to light,

589
00:41:22,245 --> 00:41:23,805
affecting her status as Mrs. Ling.

590
00:41:24,725 --> 00:41:26,685
So, she took the chance
when she went shopping

591
00:41:26,765 --> 00:41:29,645
to go to the hospital and kill Chu Yan.

592
00:41:30,085 --> 00:41:31,765
Then she returned home to cook for me

593
00:41:32,085 --> 00:41:34,285
in order to establish her own alibi.

594
00:41:34,885 --> 00:41:38,485
Yang Tong, when did you
get so good at storytelling?

595
00:41:38,565 --> 00:41:39,925
I almost believed you there.

596
00:41:40,565 --> 00:41:44,125
Xia Lin, you can fool Ling Yizhou

597
00:41:44,765 --> 00:41:46,565
and use your status as his wife

598
00:41:46,645 --> 00:41:48,725
to obscure the fact that you're a suspect,

599
00:41:49,485 --> 00:41:52,445
but you can't cover up this evidence.

600
00:41:53,805 --> 00:41:57,445
You're the one who killed Chu Yan.

601
00:41:58,245 --> 00:41:59,685
Even when Ling Yizhou gets here,

602
00:42:00,165 --> 00:42:02,285
he won't be able to change that fact.

603
00:42:07,245 --> 00:42:08,925
Please explain everything.

604
00:42:12,685 --> 00:42:14,245
What if I show up?

605
00:42:16,565 --> 00:42:19,325
Isn't that Chu Yan?

606
00:42:35,965 --> 00:42:37,805
-Mr. Ling.
-Wen Li.

607
00:42:38,085 --> 00:42:40,125
Don't worry too much
about the comments online.

608
00:42:40,605 --> 00:42:43,245
But you hate being discussed.

609
00:42:43,965 --> 00:42:45,525
That's something I'm willing to endure

610
00:42:45,605 --> 00:42:48,285
to see my wife show her love for me.

611
00:42:51,005 --> 00:42:52,565
Why am I telling you this?

612
00:42:52,645 --> 00:42:55,725
You don't get it, you don't have a wife.

613
00:42:59,565 --> 00:43:02,285
Boss, was that a workplace injury?

614
00:44:39,845 --> 00:44:41,605
Subtitle translation by Jake Eberts

615
00:44:41,685 --> 00:44:44,845
Even if there was only a 0.01% chance
of seeing you fall from grace,

616
00:44:44,925 --> 00:44:46,325
I'd still do everything I could.

617
00:44:46,405 --> 00:44:49,405
The only person who fell from grace
and lost everything...

618
00:44:49,485 --> 00:44:50,725
is you.

619
00:44:50,805 --> 00:44:52,445
An Ran, according to our investigation,

620
00:44:52,525 --> 00:44:54,645
you're accused of arson and kidnapping.

621
00:44:54,725 --> 00:44:56,365
You're now under arrest.

622
00:44:56,445 --> 00:44:58,565
Regardless of whether
it was An Ran or Yang Tong,

623
00:44:59,005 --> 00:45:01,445
they were just pawns being sacrificed.

624
00:45:01,765 --> 00:45:03,485
This matter isn't over yet.

625
00:45:04,845 --> 00:45:06,525
Who are you? Why are you following me?
