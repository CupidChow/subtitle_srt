1
00:00:12,885 --> 00:00:16,645
There's only one way to cure leukemia,
a stem cell transplant.

2
00:00:16,885 --> 00:00:20,005
Didn't you say Ling Yizhou is a match?

3
00:00:20,085 --> 00:00:21,285
Let's go see him right now.

4
00:00:22,405 --> 00:00:25,725
Women are always
throwing themselves at you.

5
00:00:26,005 --> 00:00:28,525
But don't you worry,
I'll always be by your side.

6
00:00:28,885 --> 00:00:31,845
I'll always keep an eye on you.

7
00:00:31,925 --> 00:00:35,285
I'm looking for Ling Yizhou.
I'm pregnant with his child.

8
00:00:35,365 --> 00:00:36,445
Marry me.

9
00:00:39,165 --> 00:00:42,845
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

10
00:02:09,805 --> 00:02:12,725
EPISODE 2

11
00:02:27,285 --> 00:02:28,965
What did you just say?

12
00:02:32,245 --> 00:02:33,125
Marry me.

13
00:02:38,085 --> 00:02:40,805
Mr. Ling, I didn't know that

14
00:02:41,285 --> 00:02:44,805
there are such creative ways
to turn someone down.

15
00:02:48,645 --> 00:02:51,405
You're not joking?

16
00:02:51,805 --> 00:02:52,765
Is it funny?

17
00:02:54,045 --> 00:02:54,885
But...

18
00:02:55,965 --> 00:02:59,525
with your background,
you could have anyone in the world.

19
00:03:00,605 --> 00:03:01,445
Why me?

20
00:03:01,925 --> 00:03:03,045
You need something from me.

21
00:03:04,845 --> 00:03:07,205
Mr. Ling, marriage is something serious.

22
00:03:07,605 --> 00:03:09,525
Please don't joke about my health.

23
00:03:10,565 --> 00:03:13,925
Ms. Xia, we're just taking
what we need from this marriage.

24
00:03:14,445 --> 00:03:15,285
I'm a busy man.

25
00:03:15,365 --> 00:03:17,805
I don't have the time
to put effort into a relationship.

26
00:03:18,925 --> 00:03:21,645
Rather than finding a needy woman
from a prestigious background...

27
00:03:22,685 --> 00:03:25,965
I think you fulfill
my requirements better.

28
00:03:30,245 --> 00:03:33,485
You mean a fake marriage?

29
00:03:34,005 --> 00:03:35,205
But I...

30
00:03:35,285 --> 00:03:36,525
Contact me with a decision.

31
00:03:37,245 --> 00:03:38,885
I'll give you one week to think it over.

32
00:03:45,565 --> 00:03:48,245
LING YIZHOU

33
00:04:00,405 --> 00:04:02,125
He wants a marriage of convenience.

34
00:04:02,685 --> 00:04:03,805
Marriage of convenience?

35
00:04:06,525 --> 00:04:08,365
You've read too many novels.

36
00:04:10,445 --> 00:04:13,205
According to my experience as a fan,

37
00:04:13,445 --> 00:04:15,925
Ling Yizhou, his best friend Chu Yan,

38
00:04:16,005 --> 00:04:18,285
and his assistant Wen Li
definitely have something going on.

39
00:04:19,365 --> 00:04:22,245
You're just speculating.

40
00:04:22,844 --> 00:04:24,685
Speculating?

41
00:04:24,765 --> 00:04:27,845
We have a lot of proof
to support this rumor.

42
00:04:28,245 --> 00:04:29,125
Think about it.

43
00:04:29,205 --> 00:04:32,525
Last year, Armani gave
Ling Yizhou a sponsored suit.

44
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:36,165
But the next day,
Chu Yan wore it at a red carpet event.

45
00:04:36,245 --> 00:04:37,205
What does that mean?

46
00:04:37,845 --> 00:04:40,765
They're close enough to wear
each other's clothes like buddies.

47
00:04:41,365 --> 00:04:42,525
If that's the case,

48
00:04:42,605 --> 00:04:45,045
if Chu Yan really is Ling Yizhou's buddy,

49
00:04:45,125 --> 00:04:47,125
he should be friends
with Wen Li, too, right?

50
00:04:47,605 --> 00:04:50,965
But, no, you never see those two together.

51
00:04:51,045 --> 00:04:53,925
When they do, they look very unhappy.

52
00:04:54,205 --> 00:04:56,085
If that's not a love triangle, what is?

53
00:05:00,765 --> 00:05:04,325
So, he wants to marry me

54
00:05:04,805 --> 00:05:06,285
to use me as his smokescreen.

55
00:05:06,765 --> 00:05:08,565
That must be it. Think about it.

56
00:05:09,205 --> 00:05:10,925
If he marries a woman from a rich family,

57
00:05:11,205 --> 00:05:13,085
what if people find out his secret?

58
00:05:13,165 --> 00:05:14,925
It could cause a war between companies.

59
00:05:15,325 --> 00:05:16,885
Marrying someone like you

60
00:05:16,965 --> 00:05:18,885
who has no background
and needs something from him

61
00:05:18,965 --> 00:05:19,885
would be a better idea.

62
00:05:21,205 --> 00:05:22,565
What if it isn't for convenience?

63
00:05:22,925 --> 00:05:24,085
How is that possible?

64
00:05:24,165 --> 00:05:26,285
If he liked girls,
you'd never be on his list.

65
00:05:34,205 --> 00:05:35,485
LING YIZHOU

66
00:05:41,805 --> 00:05:42,805
Let me do it.

67
00:05:58,685 --> 00:05:59,525
Hello?

68
00:06:55,045 --> 00:06:56,685
THE AMAZING IDOL

69
00:06:56,765 --> 00:06:57,965
Good work. Thank you.

70
00:06:58,045 --> 00:06:59,365
-All done.
-Good work.

71
00:06:59,845 --> 00:07:01,005
-Wipe off your sweat.
-Thanks.

72
00:07:01,085 --> 00:07:02,245
-Come move this for me.
-Water.

73
00:07:02,325 --> 00:07:03,565
-Coming.
-Thank you.

74
00:07:03,645 --> 00:07:05,565
Your dad's been calling you.
Call him back.

75
00:07:05,645 --> 00:07:06,485
OK.

76
00:07:16,925 --> 00:07:18,245
Hi, Dad.

77
00:07:18,325 --> 00:07:21,525
<i>I heard you're going to the Ling family's</i>
<i>jewelry exhibition tonight.</i>

78
00:07:22,485 --> 00:07:23,485
Why are you stalking me?

79
00:07:23,565 --> 00:07:26,165
Mr. Wang's daughter will be there, too.

80
00:07:26,245 --> 00:07:27,165
Go talk to her.

81
00:07:27,765 --> 00:07:29,085
<i>Mr. Wang of Taihe Pharmaceutical?</i>

82
00:07:30,605 --> 00:07:32,685
When did you become
interested in pharmaceuticals?

83
00:07:32,765 --> 00:07:34,965
<i>Miss Wang comes from a good family.</i>

84
00:07:35,045 --> 00:07:36,605
<i>Be on your best behavior.</i>

85
00:07:36,685 --> 00:07:38,205
<i>Don't cause me any trouble, OK?</i>

86
00:07:41,965 --> 00:07:43,845
Can we do that part again?
It's not good enough.

87
00:07:47,005 --> 00:07:49,885
CHU YAN, HUOHUO

88
00:07:51,525 --> 00:07:53,565
SOUTH ENTRANCE

89
00:07:58,285 --> 00:07:59,645
<i>Is this the place?</i>

90
00:07:59,725 --> 00:08:01,565
<i>There isn't even an entrance.</i>

91
00:08:05,965 --> 00:08:08,245
-Huohuo!
-Huohuo!

92
00:08:09,085 --> 00:08:10,685
<i>Be careful, everyone.</i>

93
00:08:10,765 --> 00:08:12,805
You guys are good.
How did you know I'd be here?

94
00:08:12,885 --> 00:08:13,965
Because we love you.

95
00:08:14,045 --> 00:08:15,365
-This is for you.
-Thank you.

96
00:08:18,725 --> 00:08:20,365
How about I treat you all to coffee?

97
00:08:20,965 --> 00:08:22,045
-Awesome!
-See you next time.

98
00:08:22,125 --> 00:08:23,645
Come this way, please.

99
00:08:24,085 --> 00:08:25,365
-Goodbye.
-This way.

100
00:08:33,685 --> 00:08:35,125
Fancy seeing you again,

101
00:08:36,005 --> 00:08:36,965
Miss Xia.

102
00:08:37,044 --> 00:08:38,164
Hello, Mr. Chu.

103
00:08:39,564 --> 00:08:40,924
Are you here waiting for me, too?

104
00:08:41,325 --> 00:08:44,085
No. I'm meeting someone here to talk.

105
00:08:44,325 --> 00:08:45,445
But I can't get in.

106
00:08:45,765 --> 00:08:46,645
Of course.

107
00:08:47,205 --> 00:08:49,845
Not everyone can get
into a jewelry exhibition.

108
00:08:49,925 --> 00:08:50,925
Jewelry exhibition?

109
00:08:51,845 --> 00:08:52,765
Why are you surprised?

110
00:08:53,405 --> 00:08:55,565
Aren't you trying to sneak into it?

111
00:08:56,165 --> 00:08:58,005
Mr. Chu, if you're going in there,
could you...

112
00:08:58,085 --> 00:08:59,245
No.

113
00:08:59,525 --> 00:09:01,525
Even if you beg me, I'd still say no.

114
00:09:02,325 --> 00:09:03,965
-Do you know why?
-Why?

115
00:09:08,645 --> 00:09:10,725
Because you're not my type.

116
00:09:12,125 --> 00:09:15,605
Mr. Chu, you aren't my type either.

117
00:09:18,925 --> 00:09:20,005
Your fly is open.

118
00:09:20,805 --> 00:09:23,485
How's that possible? You lied to me.

119
00:09:24,205 --> 00:09:27,045
How could I not be your type?
Do you know how many fans I have?

120
00:09:27,125 --> 00:09:29,645
No. But I'm not one of them.

121
00:09:29,725 --> 00:09:30,565
You...

122
00:09:36,125 --> 00:09:36,965
Goodbye, Mr. Chu.

123
00:09:44,685 --> 00:09:45,525
Wen Li?

124
00:09:53,085 --> 00:09:54,085
Interesting.

125
00:09:55,725 --> 00:09:56,565
Yizhou,

126
00:09:57,125 --> 00:09:59,885
are you dating that Xia girl?

127
00:10:01,365 --> 00:10:02,325
What do you want?

128
00:10:02,925 --> 00:10:04,445
I saw Wen Li let her in.

129
00:10:05,125 --> 00:10:06,245
Are you meeting up with her?

130
00:10:06,725 --> 00:10:08,205
If you have the time to spy on me...

131
00:10:09,525 --> 00:10:12,405
maybe you should think about
what to do with your blind date.

132
00:10:12,765 --> 00:10:16,165
You'd bring that
unpleasant matter up for a girl?

133
00:10:36,085 --> 00:10:39,285
Mr. Ling, I'd like to talk about

134
00:10:40,205 --> 00:10:43,805
what you proposed last time.

135
00:10:50,125 --> 00:10:51,525
You've made up your mind?

136
00:10:54,725 --> 00:10:56,325
Actually, I...

137
00:10:57,525 --> 00:10:58,805
-I...
-That's enough.

138
00:10:59,645 --> 00:11:02,045
I need a date
for the jewelry exhibition tonight.

139
00:11:02,725 --> 00:11:03,965
We'll talk after that.

140
00:11:04,885 --> 00:11:05,725
A date?

141
00:11:23,085 --> 00:11:23,925
Next.

142
00:11:36,805 --> 00:11:37,645
Next.

143
00:11:42,485 --> 00:11:45,765
Mr. Ling, which dress do you like?

144
00:11:47,725 --> 00:11:48,565
Any will do.

145
00:11:49,645 --> 00:11:51,205
Any will do?

146
00:11:51,285 --> 00:11:53,365
Why didn't you say earlier?
I changed so many times.

147
00:11:54,005 --> 00:11:56,165
Don't girls love to try on new clothes?

148
00:11:56,605 --> 00:11:57,925
That's true.

149
00:11:58,325 --> 00:12:00,205
But, I didn't have time
to take any photos.

150
00:12:00,565 --> 00:12:01,405
I did.

151
00:12:05,685 --> 00:12:06,685
Let me see.

152
00:12:16,565 --> 00:12:19,445
These photos are horrible.

153
00:12:26,165 --> 00:12:27,205
Don't move. Look up.

154
00:12:32,845 --> 00:12:36,565
Is this real?

155
00:12:38,005 --> 00:12:39,845
Yes. It's very expensive.

156
00:12:40,645 --> 00:12:43,445
I can't pay for it
if anything happens to it.

157
00:12:44,845 --> 00:12:46,405
Then you'll have to pay with your body.

158
00:12:50,165 --> 00:12:51,125
Are you nervous?

159
00:12:52,885 --> 00:12:54,605
No...

160
00:12:55,605 --> 00:12:57,485
Then why can I hear your heart pounding?

161
00:12:59,805 --> 00:13:01,885
I... I have arrhythmia.

162
00:13:05,085 --> 00:13:06,325
I'll get you some earrings.

163
00:13:08,485 --> 00:13:10,485
I'll get them myself.

164
00:13:44,325 --> 00:13:46,605
-Mr. Chu.
-Miss Wang.

165
00:13:47,045 --> 00:13:49,125
This is where you like
to have blind dates?

166
00:13:49,645 --> 00:13:50,485
Yes.

167
00:13:50,845 --> 00:13:52,925
At least it won't be boring here.

168
00:14:02,005 --> 00:14:02,925
I forgot my bow tie.

169
00:14:22,085 --> 00:14:23,725
What do you think about this necklace?

170
00:14:25,165 --> 00:14:26,365
I know nothing about jewelry.

171
00:14:27,005 --> 00:14:29,125
But I know the bigger the diamond is,
the better.

172
00:14:30,085 --> 00:14:33,205
The diamonds on this one
are too small for you.

173
00:14:35,605 --> 00:14:36,885
Excuse me for a moment.

174
00:15:05,365 --> 00:15:06,925
Is that Xia Lin?

175
00:15:20,525 --> 00:15:22,205
This necklace costs five million dollars.

176
00:15:22,805 --> 00:15:24,285
It looks very nice.

177
00:15:24,765 --> 00:15:27,965
These are Hearts and Arrows diamonds.

178
00:15:28,045 --> 00:15:29,445
They're very valuable.

179
00:15:31,165 --> 00:15:33,445
-The design is quite elegant.
-Yes.

180
00:15:33,525 --> 00:15:34,365
Take a look.

181
00:15:44,845 --> 00:15:45,965
So beautiful.

182
00:15:47,005 --> 00:15:50,045
How many years
would I need to save up for this?

183
00:15:52,445 --> 00:15:55,845
Legend has it that
Catherine the Great's orders

184
00:15:55,925 --> 00:15:57,165
inspired craftsmen to invent

185
00:15:57,245 --> 00:16:01,045
the brilliant cut for diamonds,
which makes them even more beautiful.

186
00:16:02,005 --> 00:16:03,525
Without her...

187
00:16:04,685 --> 00:16:07,125
women wouldn't love diamonds
as much as they do now.

188
00:16:08,845 --> 00:16:11,445
Mr. Chu, you're very knowledgeable.

189
00:16:13,365 --> 00:16:15,005
When you're all dressed up, you look...

190
00:16:16,245 --> 00:16:17,085
even more annoying.

191
00:16:20,325 --> 00:16:22,885
Mr. Chu, have I somehow

192
00:16:22,965 --> 00:16:25,565
-offended you in some way?
-No.

193
00:16:26,245 --> 00:16:29,605
I feel like you have a problem with me.

194
00:16:31,925 --> 00:16:32,765
Fine.

195
00:16:34,485 --> 00:16:36,045
How did you meet Ling Yizhou?

196
00:16:39,085 --> 00:16:41,525
It was just... by chance.

197
00:16:42,605 --> 00:16:45,085
Did you go to casting in his car that day?

198
00:16:46,645 --> 00:16:48,605
It was just a ride.

199
00:16:51,605 --> 00:16:54,085
You're just trying to use him.

200
00:16:54,525 --> 00:16:57,365
You want to get the lead role
in the Lingshi Group commercial.

201
00:16:57,965 --> 00:16:59,805
Or do you want more?

202
00:17:01,765 --> 00:17:02,765
You can give up now.

203
00:17:03,365 --> 00:17:04,925
He has lots of options.

204
00:17:05,765 --> 00:17:08,165
<i>He's jealous.</i>

205
00:17:08,685 --> 00:17:10,525
<i>No wonder he was being mean.</i>

206
00:17:11,005 --> 00:17:12,525
<i>I don't want to deal with this.</i>

207
00:17:13,645 --> 00:17:15,364
Mr. Chu, this is a misunderstanding.

208
00:17:15,445 --> 00:17:17,885
I don't know Mr. Ling that well. Goodbye.

209
00:17:24,364 --> 00:17:26,245
A lot of women have the same dream.

210
00:17:26,324 --> 00:17:28,604
If you're honest about it,
maybe I can help you.

211
00:17:29,324 --> 00:17:30,165
Let go.

212
00:17:33,445 --> 00:17:34,285
I don't want to.

213
00:17:47,325 --> 00:17:48,725
Got rid of another one.

214
00:17:53,965 --> 00:17:54,965
Xia Lin.

215
00:17:59,645 --> 00:18:00,925
I almost didn't recognize you.

216
00:18:01,925 --> 00:18:02,885
You don't have to.

217
00:18:03,525 --> 00:18:06,485
We're strangers who don't talk anymore.

218
00:18:07,205 --> 00:18:08,765
Where's the man you were with?

219
00:18:09,605 --> 00:18:12,965
Are you dating him
to squeeze into the upper class?

220
00:18:14,045 --> 00:18:17,485
That's my business, not yours.

221
00:18:24,685 --> 00:18:26,765
Isn't that the most prized piece
of this show?

222
00:18:27,685 --> 00:18:28,605
Where did you get it?

223
00:18:37,045 --> 00:18:38,045
What's wrong?

224
00:18:43,325 --> 00:18:44,165
Honey...

225
00:18:45,085 --> 00:18:46,885
didn't you say you'd buy me a gift?

226
00:18:47,965 --> 00:18:48,925
I like that necklace.

227
00:18:49,845 --> 00:18:50,685
Then I'll buy it.

228
00:18:51,205 --> 00:18:53,085
It can be your one-month anniversary gift.

229
00:18:55,445 --> 00:18:56,365
Yes, Mr. Zhao?

230
00:18:56,645 --> 00:18:57,925
I want this necklace.

231
00:18:58,485 --> 00:18:59,925
This necklace is a special exhibit.

232
00:19:00,285 --> 00:19:03,085
It must be paid for within three days
and it is non-refundable.

233
00:19:06,765 --> 00:19:08,445
SUBSCRIPTION FOR JEWELRY

234
00:19:10,525 --> 00:19:12,965
I'll have someone pay in cash
in a few days.

235
00:19:19,965 --> 00:19:22,205
You like the man I was with.

236
00:19:22,285 --> 00:19:24,085
You like the necklace I'm wearing.

237
00:19:24,685 --> 00:19:26,085
Is it me that you actually like?

238
00:19:27,125 --> 00:19:28,565
-You...
-Fine.

239
00:19:28,645 --> 00:19:30,285
I hope you think of me when you wear it.

240
00:19:33,805 --> 00:19:36,885
Are you sure you can afford this necklace?

241
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:40,685
What do you mean?

242
00:19:41,205 --> 00:19:42,485
Mr. Zhao, Miss Qin,

243
00:19:43,005 --> 00:19:44,645
this necklace costs 50 million dollars.

244
00:19:46,365 --> 00:19:47,285
Are you kidding me?

245
00:19:47,805 --> 00:19:49,325
Do you think I'm stupid?

246
00:19:49,845 --> 00:19:52,325
With that many carats,
it would be at most five million.

247
00:19:52,805 --> 00:19:54,925
A Ling family executive set the price.

248
00:19:55,445 --> 00:19:56,285
Please pay on time.

249
00:19:57,925 --> 00:19:59,165
You're from the Ling family?

250
00:20:00,005 --> 00:20:02,285
That's impossible.
I know all their executives.

251
00:20:02,365 --> 00:20:03,205
I don't know you.

252
00:20:03,565 --> 00:20:05,885
If he doesn't pay the full amount
within three days,

253
00:20:05,965 --> 00:20:07,965
-notify the legal department.
-Yes, Director Ling.

254
00:20:09,325 --> 00:20:10,285
Director?

255
00:20:10,365 --> 00:20:11,205
You may go now.

256
00:20:12,405 --> 00:20:13,245
He's Ling Yizhou?

257
00:20:14,165 --> 00:20:15,765
How would she know Ling Yizhou?

258
00:20:18,605 --> 00:20:19,725
Wait.

259
00:20:22,325 --> 00:20:23,285
Zhao Jiayan.

260
00:20:24,445 --> 00:20:26,165
Your family owns Xuhui Real Estate, right?

261
00:20:27,045 --> 00:20:28,845
I just happen to know your father.

262
00:20:29,605 --> 00:20:32,765
I'm sure he'll willingly pay the bill
for your mistake.

263
00:20:33,645 --> 00:20:34,765
Or would you rather

264
00:20:34,845 --> 00:20:36,205
go to the public security bureau?

265
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:37,365
Director Ling...

266
00:20:38,645 --> 00:20:39,765
can you let this go?

267
00:20:52,445 --> 00:20:53,645
Apologize.

268
00:20:53,725 --> 00:20:54,805
What?

269
00:20:54,885 --> 00:20:56,525
Apologize to Xia Lin.

270
00:20:57,045 --> 00:20:59,005
Then, I'll consider buying
the necklace for you.

271
00:21:07,805 --> 00:21:11,325
Xia Lin, I shouldn't have cheated on you.

272
00:21:11,845 --> 00:21:15,205
But we had happy times together
in the past.

273
00:21:15,525 --> 00:21:16,565
Can you forgive me?

274
00:21:23,525 --> 00:21:24,605
Say something.

275
00:21:26,485 --> 00:21:29,085
I'm sorry I stole your boyfriend.

276
00:21:29,965 --> 00:21:31,005
But without us,

277
00:21:31,605 --> 00:21:33,485
you wouldn't have climbed even higher.

278
00:21:34,285 --> 00:21:36,685
Yeah. Let's call it even.

279
00:21:37,085 --> 00:21:38,045
We can both start over.

280
00:21:38,845 --> 00:21:39,725
Let's go.

281
00:21:41,845 --> 00:21:43,445
I don't need their apologies.

282
00:21:52,205 --> 00:21:55,325
Director Ling, I did everything
you wanted me to.

283
00:21:55,725 --> 00:21:56,565
Can you...

284
00:22:09,125 --> 00:22:10,725
Don't you ever...

285
00:22:11,885 --> 00:22:13,525
show up in front of her again.

286
00:22:22,005 --> 00:22:23,245
What are you all looking at?

287
00:22:51,125 --> 00:22:52,725
Thank you for standing up for me today.

288
00:22:53,165 --> 00:22:56,045
You like helping people, don't you?

289
00:22:56,805 --> 00:22:58,245
I think you've misunderstood me.

290
00:22:58,725 --> 00:23:01,125
Even if you don't want
to give me your bone marrow,

291
00:23:01,205 --> 00:23:02,845
you don't have to deny being nice.

292
00:23:08,085 --> 00:23:09,965
I forgot to return this, Mr. Ling.

293
00:23:10,325 --> 00:23:12,005
No need to return it. I've bought it.

294
00:23:12,365 --> 00:23:13,245
What?

295
00:23:13,925 --> 00:23:15,405
You didn't have to buy it for me.

296
00:23:16,845 --> 00:23:18,205
-Where are you going?
-Come on.

297
00:23:18,285 --> 00:23:19,965
We have to return it. It's too expensive.

298
00:23:20,405 --> 00:23:22,765
I bought it for my grandmother, not you.

299
00:23:25,085 --> 00:23:26,605
You scared me.

300
00:23:29,085 --> 00:23:30,565
Here you go.

301
00:23:34,365 --> 00:23:35,365
Don't lose them.

302
00:23:46,205 --> 00:23:47,045
Oh, yes...

303
00:23:48,165 --> 00:23:50,885
I want to talk about what you said before.

304
00:23:52,325 --> 00:23:54,845
I thought about it
and went to many hospitals.

305
00:23:55,845 --> 00:23:57,085
They couldn't help me.

306
00:23:58,005 --> 00:23:58,885
So?

307
00:24:01,005 --> 00:24:02,125
Mr. Ling...

308
00:24:03,125 --> 00:24:04,725
you probably don't believe in marriage.

309
00:24:07,045 --> 00:24:09,525
I do. That's why I'm not doing it.

310
00:24:12,205 --> 00:24:16,365
It seems like you see marriage
as something sacred.

311
00:24:17,725 --> 00:24:20,965
I've always believed that two people
must love each other enough

312
00:24:21,565 --> 00:24:24,005
in order to get married.

313
00:24:24,485 --> 00:24:29,245
So I don't know if it's right
to treat it as an agreement.

314
00:24:29,925 --> 00:24:31,605
Love isn't everything in a marriage.

315
00:24:31,965 --> 00:24:34,125
Love doesn't necessarily
equal a happy marriage.

316
00:24:34,725 --> 00:24:35,605
In my opinion,

317
00:24:36,445 --> 00:24:39,765
marriage is more like a responsibility.

318
00:24:40,285 --> 00:24:41,525
Don't worry. I promise you...

319
00:24:42,365 --> 00:24:44,165
even if we get married
because of an agreement,

320
00:24:45,005 --> 00:24:47,125
I'll do my best to be a good husband.

321
00:24:49,605 --> 00:24:51,165
It's not that I don't trust you,

322
00:24:52,165 --> 00:24:53,445
it's that I don't trust myself.

323
00:24:54,205 --> 00:24:56,285
You're such a good man.

324
00:24:56,965 --> 00:24:58,125
I'm worried I'll fall for you.

325
00:25:02,645 --> 00:25:04,845
Just kidding. Don't worry.

326
00:25:06,245 --> 00:25:09,645
I won't get in the way
of your pursuit of true love.

327
00:25:11,205 --> 00:25:12,045
Miss Xia.

328
00:25:12,765 --> 00:25:15,085
I think you're a very responsible person.

329
00:25:15,845 --> 00:25:17,165
I also think that

330
00:25:17,245 --> 00:25:20,365
we're going to work well together.

331
00:25:30,925 --> 00:25:32,485
GRANDMOTHER

332
00:25:34,845 --> 00:25:35,845
Answer my phone for me.

333
00:25:40,125 --> 00:25:41,645
I'm driving. I can't take it.

334
00:25:51,845 --> 00:25:53,205
Hello?

335
00:25:54,365 --> 00:25:56,605
Hello. So...

336
00:25:56,685 --> 00:25:58,925
I'm Yizhou's grandmother.

337
00:25:59,605 --> 00:26:02,045
What's your name?

338
00:26:02,365 --> 00:26:05,165
I... My name is Xia Lin.

339
00:26:07,045 --> 00:26:09,605
He's driving,
so he couldn't pick up his phone.

340
00:26:09,685 --> 00:26:10,605
<i>Xia Lin, is it?</i>

341
00:26:11,045 --> 00:26:13,605
So nice to hear your voice, Xia Lin.

342
00:26:14,245 --> 00:26:15,805
Could I ask you

343
00:26:15,885 --> 00:26:19,725
which seat you're sitting in?

344
00:26:20,325 --> 00:26:21,205
Seat?

345
00:26:21,445 --> 00:26:24,405
<i>Are you in the front or in the back?</i>

346
00:26:24,485 --> 00:26:25,445
I'm in the front.

347
00:26:25,525 --> 00:26:26,525
<i>Good!</i>

348
00:26:27,085 --> 00:26:28,005
<i>That's wonderful!</i>

349
00:26:28,805 --> 00:26:29,765
Are you alright?

350
00:26:31,125 --> 00:26:33,245
<i>I'm getting old now.</i>

351
00:26:33,845 --> 00:26:34,805
<i>That happens sometimes.</i>

352
00:26:35,205 --> 00:26:38,125
But I'm very glad. I'm so happy.

353
00:26:38,525 --> 00:26:42,085
Could you two come see me right now?

354
00:26:45,925 --> 00:26:46,885
Right now?

355
00:26:46,965 --> 00:26:48,885
<i>I'm waiting for you in the hospital.</i>

356
00:26:53,365 --> 00:26:54,365
What did she say?

357
00:26:57,685 --> 00:26:58,685
She wants to see us.

358
00:27:09,205 --> 00:27:10,965
-Grandmother.
-You're here.

359
00:27:12,605 --> 00:27:13,445
Come here.

360
00:27:19,845 --> 00:27:20,805
Hello, Mrs. Ling.

361
00:27:20,885 --> 00:27:22,045
My name is Xia Lin.

362
00:27:22,885 --> 00:27:24,405
You're Xia Lin?

363
00:27:24,805 --> 00:27:27,045
Come here, Linlin. Come to Grandma.

364
00:27:29,845 --> 00:27:30,845
Let me tell you something.

365
00:27:31,525 --> 00:27:34,725
Yizhou has never let
any girl sit in the front.

366
00:27:35,005 --> 00:27:38,045
You're the first. So I had to meet you.

367
00:27:40,165 --> 00:27:42,765
Grandma, don't scare her off.

368
00:27:42,845 --> 00:27:43,845
She was very nervous.

369
00:27:43,925 --> 00:27:45,605
She insisted on changing before we came.

370
00:27:47,245 --> 00:27:49,245
Now you know how to care about others?

371
00:27:51,045 --> 00:27:52,565
Linlin, I hope you don't mind.

372
00:27:52,845 --> 00:27:54,405
I'm just so glad.

373
00:27:55,485 --> 00:27:58,485
I've always wanted Yizhou
to get married and have children.

374
00:27:58,965 --> 00:28:01,485
Now I can rest assured.

375
00:28:04,045 --> 00:28:05,285
Mrs. Ling, it's not...

376
00:28:11,445 --> 00:28:14,045
I'm sure that you'll get better

377
00:28:14,125 --> 00:28:15,485
and live for many more years.

378
00:28:15,885 --> 00:28:18,045
Good girl. I hope so, too.

379
00:28:18,325 --> 00:28:20,005
I hope that I live to 100.

380
00:28:20,085 --> 00:28:21,925
Miss Xia, please come with me.

381
00:28:26,205 --> 00:28:27,925
Mrs. Ling, you should get some rest.

382
00:28:28,205 --> 00:28:29,205
I have to go now.

383
00:28:29,285 --> 00:28:30,565
OK. No problem.

384
00:28:36,645 --> 00:28:38,165
You're marrying her?

385
00:28:39,845 --> 00:28:42,165
She seems nice. I like her.

386
00:28:42,245 --> 00:28:43,245
Good luck.

387
00:28:49,205 --> 00:28:51,125
37.5 degrees. You have a slight fever.

388
00:28:53,765 --> 00:28:54,725
Nurse,

389
00:28:55,205 --> 00:28:58,125
is there something wrong with me again?

390
00:28:58,565 --> 00:29:00,245
Is it getting worse?

391
00:29:01,165 --> 00:29:04,085
Just tell me the truth. It's OK.

392
00:29:04,525 --> 00:29:05,525
I can take it.

393
00:29:06,045 --> 00:29:07,325
Don't worry, Miss Xia.

394
00:29:07,405 --> 00:29:09,405
Mr. Ling said you might have a cold.

395
00:29:09,485 --> 00:29:11,085
So he wanted us to give you a checkup.

396
00:29:11,725 --> 00:29:13,005
-Ling Yizhou?
-Yes.

397
00:29:13,365 --> 00:29:14,765
Let's take your blood pressure.

398
00:29:35,485 --> 00:29:37,525
SURGERY

399
00:29:37,605 --> 00:29:39,085
-Out of the way.
-Hurry!

400
00:29:40,005 --> 00:29:40,845
Out of the way!

401
00:29:50,045 --> 00:29:51,605
Don't run off if you get scared easily.

402
00:30:00,365 --> 00:30:01,245
Thank you.

403
00:30:01,725 --> 00:30:02,565
For what?

404
00:30:06,165 --> 00:30:07,565
You want to get married...

405
00:30:09,205 --> 00:30:10,725
because of your grandma, right?

406
00:30:12,965 --> 00:30:14,125
The reason isn't important.

407
00:30:14,485 --> 00:30:17,245
What's important is
whether you accept my proposal.

408
00:30:23,765 --> 00:30:24,805
Never mind then.

409
00:30:32,165 --> 00:30:33,685
I was hesitating

410
00:30:34,725 --> 00:30:36,525
because I couldn't imagine

411
00:30:36,605 --> 00:30:40,685
what it would be like
to marry a complete stranger.

412
00:30:44,725 --> 00:30:46,605
But after being with you today...

413
00:30:49,045 --> 00:30:50,045
I think...

414
00:30:52,125 --> 00:30:53,405
we could give it a try.

415
00:31:07,685 --> 00:31:08,605
What did you say?

416
00:31:10,765 --> 00:31:11,805
I said...

417
00:31:13,565 --> 00:31:14,885
let's help each other out.

418
00:31:24,965 --> 00:31:25,805
Are you sure?

419
00:31:29,085 --> 00:31:30,005
Let's get married.

420
00:31:31,805 --> 00:31:32,645
OK.

421
00:31:35,725 --> 00:31:37,365
You're meeting Miss Xia at ten o'clock.

422
00:31:37,445 --> 00:31:39,565
At 10:30, you have a conference call
with Real Estate.

423
00:31:39,845 --> 00:31:41,365
Lunch is with Commissioner Tang.

424
00:31:41,445 --> 00:31:43,525
That's all for this morning.

425
00:31:43,805 --> 00:31:44,805
What time is it now?

426
00:31:44,885 --> 00:31:45,925
It's 9:59.

427
00:31:50,005 --> 00:31:51,925
Miss Xia might be stuck in traffic.

428
00:31:54,045 --> 00:31:55,965
Maybe she's trying to intimidate me.

429
00:31:59,005 --> 00:32:00,365
-Sorry.
-You're three minutes late.

430
00:32:00,445 --> 00:32:01,725
You have 27 minutes left. Hurry.

431
00:32:02,605 --> 00:32:04,205
There aren't that many clauses.

432
00:32:04,285 --> 00:32:05,765
-I have a question.
-Yes?

433
00:32:06,205 --> 00:32:08,285
Why are you willing to sign
a marriage contract?

434
00:32:08,365 --> 00:32:10,805
I don't believe in promises.
I'm glad that...

435
00:32:11,485 --> 00:32:12,565
we agree on this.

436
00:32:12,645 --> 00:32:14,405
Other than my contract with the agency,

437
00:32:14,485 --> 00:32:16,325
this is the first time I've signed one.

438
00:32:16,725 --> 00:32:18,525
-Me too.
-You've never signed one?

439
00:32:19,405 --> 00:32:20,685
It's my first marriage contract.

440
00:32:21,285 --> 00:32:22,685
Also my first time being Party B.

441
00:32:24,045 --> 00:32:24,885
Mr. Ling,

442
00:32:25,405 --> 00:32:27,925
to protect my personal interests
and safety,

443
00:32:28,005 --> 00:32:29,485
I've stipulated these clauses.

444
00:32:30,085 --> 00:32:31,525
You can ask questions,

445
00:32:31,605 --> 00:32:34,565
but I reserve the right
for final explanation.

446
00:32:39,965 --> 00:32:40,805
MARRIAGE CONTRACT

447
00:32:50,365 --> 00:32:51,485
What are you doing?

448
00:32:52,085 --> 00:32:53,485
I value efficiency.

449
00:32:53,765 --> 00:32:56,325
We can look at it together
to get it done faster.

450
00:32:57,205 --> 00:33:00,485
After marriage, Party A and Party B
shall have at least two houses?

451
00:33:01,765 --> 00:33:02,605
I didn't write that.

452
00:33:09,325 --> 00:33:10,245
That was a mistake.

453
00:33:10,325 --> 00:33:11,805
I meant two bedrooms.

454
00:33:12,765 --> 00:33:13,725
Don't worry.

455
00:33:13,805 --> 00:33:16,485
After marriage, my lawyer
will inform you of all my assets.

456
00:33:16,925 --> 00:33:18,845
No need for that. Look at Clause 11.

457
00:33:18,925 --> 00:33:20,405
Assets of each party

458
00:33:20,485 --> 00:33:22,125
do not become mutual assets

459
00:33:22,205 --> 00:33:23,845
after the marriage.

460
00:33:23,925 --> 00:33:24,845
Whatever.

461
00:33:28,485 --> 00:33:30,165
This contract is effective for one year.

462
00:33:30,245 --> 00:33:33,125
In one year, the contract
will be automatically terminated.

463
00:33:33,205 --> 00:33:34,405
Delete this clause.

464
00:33:35,205 --> 00:33:36,645
Don't you see the asterisk?

465
00:33:36,725 --> 00:33:37,965
It's the most important clause.

466
00:33:38,405 --> 00:33:39,365
Even if I get surgery,

467
00:33:39,925 --> 00:33:42,485
it doesn't guarantee
that I'll completely recover.

468
00:33:42,885 --> 00:33:45,965
So, continuing the marriage
would be in your best interest.

469
00:33:48,205 --> 00:33:49,365
That's not what I mean.

470
00:33:49,685 --> 00:33:53,285
I mean, I can't determine
the rest of my life

471
00:33:53,925 --> 00:33:55,405
with something so unsure.

472
00:33:57,765 --> 00:33:58,605
Three years.

473
00:33:59,925 --> 00:34:01,885
I'll give you a choice
when three years is up.

474
00:34:02,245 --> 00:34:03,525
One year. I've already decided.

475
00:34:03,605 --> 00:34:05,165
-Five years.
-You're making it longer?

476
00:34:05,925 --> 00:34:06,805
Seven years.

477
00:34:10,045 --> 00:34:11,565
Two years. No more.

478
00:34:11,645 --> 00:34:12,525
Deal.

479
00:34:15,005 --> 00:34:16,125
No need to be so formal.

480
00:34:18,885 --> 00:34:20,885
After marriage, you'll move into my place.

481
00:34:21,445 --> 00:34:23,204
I'll have Wen Li help you move.

482
00:34:23,684 --> 00:34:25,684
May I ask where you live?

483
00:34:25,765 --> 00:34:27,525
The Ling family house. With my grandma.

484
00:34:28,885 --> 00:34:30,805
So we'll be sleeping in the same room?

485
00:34:30,885 --> 00:34:32,045
What's wrong with that?

486
00:34:32,365 --> 00:34:33,605
Is there room for discussion?

487
00:34:34,204 --> 00:34:35,485
We could move out.

488
00:34:36,365 --> 00:34:38,204
You think I'd leave my grandma for you?

489
00:34:39,885 --> 00:34:40,765
You wouldn't.

490
00:34:41,965 --> 00:34:44,525
But faking something
in front of an old lady

491
00:34:45,005 --> 00:34:46,684
disturbs my conscience.

492
00:34:52,445 --> 00:34:53,805
These are all the properties I own.

493
00:34:54,204 --> 00:34:56,365
You can choose one as our home.

494
00:34:56,925 --> 00:34:58,445
You agree to move out?

495
00:34:58,805 --> 00:34:59,805
So you won't mess up.

496
00:35:01,285 --> 00:35:03,525
We can visit her often.

497
00:35:09,645 --> 00:35:12,325
I'd never be able to sleep
in such a fancy house.

498
00:35:13,045 --> 00:35:14,765
Don't you have something more low-key?

499
00:35:15,325 --> 00:35:17,325
The Ling family house. Want to live there?

500
00:35:20,125 --> 00:35:23,165
This one. It seems more down-to-earth.

501
00:35:27,565 --> 00:35:29,045
You'll have a lot to get used to.

502
00:35:29,565 --> 00:35:31,685
I won't always be as patient

503
00:35:31,765 --> 00:35:33,005
as I am right now.

504
00:35:36,885 --> 00:35:37,765
Understand?

505
00:35:44,045 --> 00:35:45,685
Miss Xia, your coffee.

506
00:35:46,205 --> 00:35:47,045
Thank you.

507
00:35:47,645 --> 00:35:50,245
Please remind Mr. Ling
to take his stomach medicine.

508
00:35:52,885 --> 00:35:55,165
Does he have a stomach problem?

509
00:35:55,725 --> 00:35:57,725
No. He'll drink at lunch today.

510
00:35:57,805 --> 00:36:00,285
I'm worried it will upset his stomach,
I got him some medicine.

511
00:36:02,125 --> 00:36:03,085
Is that so?

512
00:36:03,965 --> 00:36:05,525
You're so considerate.

513
00:36:05,605 --> 00:36:07,565
Even more considerate than a woman.

514
00:36:09,845 --> 00:36:12,245
We'll be seeing each other all the time.

515
00:36:12,845 --> 00:36:14,725
Don't worry about me. Don't feel awkward.

516
00:36:15,325 --> 00:36:17,685
I'm sure we'll get along.

517
00:36:23,205 --> 00:36:24,605
Excuse me. I need to take this.

518
00:36:25,925 --> 00:36:26,765
Hello?

519
00:36:30,485 --> 00:36:31,325
OK.

520
00:36:51,925 --> 00:36:54,325
FINANCIAL ECONOMICS

521
00:37:03,925 --> 00:37:04,885
This one?

522
00:37:06,805 --> 00:37:09,805
How do you know which one I'm touching?
You have eyes on top of your head?

523
00:37:11,645 --> 00:37:13,405
I'll read anything.

524
00:37:21,525 --> 00:37:23,525
-Did you bring your papers?
-Yes.

525
00:37:23,605 --> 00:37:24,845
Good.

526
00:37:25,365 --> 00:37:26,645
-Let's go.
-Where?

527
00:37:26,725 --> 00:37:28,125
The Civil Affairs Bureau.

528
00:37:28,205 --> 00:37:30,125
Marriage is serious.
We don't have to rush it.

529
00:37:33,045 --> 00:37:35,125
MARRIAGE REGISTRATION
GANGDONG CIVIL AFFAIRS BUREAU

530
00:37:48,325 --> 00:37:49,205
Hello.

531
00:37:50,245 --> 00:37:51,285
Here you go.

532
00:37:55,445 --> 00:37:56,845
There's no getting out of this now.

533
00:37:59,445 --> 00:38:02,245
I'm not stupid enough
to give up on life and money.

534
00:38:02,965 --> 00:38:04,125
-That's good.
-Wait.

535
00:38:04,525 --> 00:38:06,805
Miss, are you voluntarily
marrying this man?

536
00:38:09,645 --> 00:38:10,925
I am. I want to do this.

537
00:38:11,165 --> 00:38:12,885
If there's a problem, just let me know.

538
00:38:13,205 --> 00:38:15,805
The law protects your will to marry.

539
00:38:18,725 --> 00:38:20,445
Your name is Ni Hao...

540
00:38:21,885 --> 00:38:23,925
This is our first day as a married couple.

541
00:38:24,765 --> 00:38:25,845
Don't cause trouble.

542
00:38:26,325 --> 00:38:28,205
I'm not a superstitious man.

543
00:38:29,925 --> 00:38:32,885
But it's OK. You've amused me.

544
00:38:35,805 --> 00:38:36,645
Mrs. Ling.

545
00:38:41,285 --> 00:38:42,445
Sorry about that.

546
00:38:42,525 --> 00:38:44,685
My husband has a short temper.

547
00:38:44,765 --> 00:38:45,925
I hope you don't mind.

548
00:38:46,005 --> 00:38:47,165
Yes. I'm mean.

549
00:38:48,525 --> 00:38:51,125
I've seen how much in love
the two of you are.

550
00:38:52,805 --> 00:38:53,645
Congratulations.

551
00:38:57,685 --> 00:39:00,085
Please move closer to each other
and look happy.

552
00:39:00,685 --> 00:39:01,725
OK.

553
00:39:02,405 --> 00:39:04,165
Closer. Ready?

554
00:39:05,005 --> 00:39:06,005
Good.

555
00:39:16,485 --> 00:39:19,205
Others marry for love.
I married for my life.

556
00:39:20,005 --> 00:39:22,405
Love and life, which is more important?

557
00:39:23,085 --> 00:39:24,085
It depends on the person.

558
00:39:24,885 --> 00:39:25,725
That's true.

559
00:39:26,445 --> 00:39:27,805
I don't have anyone I love.

560
00:39:28,525 --> 00:39:29,965
I might as well save my own life.

561
00:39:30,365 --> 00:39:32,285
You'd do the same, wouldn't you?

562
00:39:32,365 --> 00:39:34,565
No. I have the money to cure myself.

563
00:39:41,605 --> 00:39:43,485
Notify the hospital
to prepare for surgery.

564
00:39:43,565 --> 00:39:44,405
Yes, sir.

565
00:39:50,285 --> 00:39:53,925
You arranged all this?

566
00:39:57,085 --> 00:39:59,805
It's very special.

567
00:40:04,645 --> 00:40:06,485
-Thank you.
-For what?

568
00:40:14,045 --> 00:40:16,325
Glad to work with you, Mr. Ling.

569
00:40:24,685 --> 00:40:27,245
Glad to work with you, Mrs. Ling.

570
00:40:56,845 --> 00:40:57,685
Too much skin.

571
00:41:04,005 --> 00:41:04,845
Next.

572
00:41:14,245 --> 00:41:15,205
Too much skin.

573
00:41:19,085 --> 00:41:19,925
This one.

574
00:42:51,165 --> 00:42:52,965
Subtitle translation by Sophie Chang

575
00:42:53,325 --> 00:42:55,485
Mr. Wen, do you have a girlfriend?

576
00:42:55,845 --> 00:42:58,485
I want to focus on work.
I don't want to date right now.

577
00:42:58,565 --> 00:43:01,005
If a man really was interested in you,

578
00:43:01,085 --> 00:43:02,565
he would do something about it.

579
00:43:03,245 --> 00:43:04,565
Ms. Huang works for Grandma.

580
00:43:04,645 --> 00:43:07,125
If she finds out we don't sleep together,
she'll be suspicious.

581
00:43:07,605 --> 00:43:09,005
But we signed a contract.

582
00:43:09,365 --> 00:43:11,445
An Ran, she isn't my friend.

583
00:43:11,885 --> 00:43:12,965
She's my wife.

584
00:43:13,405 --> 00:43:15,405
I don't have an ulterior motive.

585
00:43:15,765 --> 00:43:17,645
Ling Yizhou is an adult.

586
00:43:17,725 --> 00:43:19,125
Do you think I could trick him?
