1
00:00:13,405 --> 00:00:15,205
You mean I posted this on Weibo?

2
00:00:16,045 --> 00:00:18,245
Your wife manages your Weibo account.

3
00:00:20,245 --> 00:00:21,725
Now you've upset Ling.

4
00:00:22,445 --> 00:00:24,365
That makes regaining his affection

5
00:00:24,445 --> 00:00:26,805
pretty much impossible.

6
00:00:27,405 --> 00:00:28,285
What are you doing?

7
00:00:29,845 --> 00:00:31,725
I don't want to waste time on this.

8
00:00:32,445 --> 00:00:34,325
If you want to know my size,
go ask Wen Li.

9
00:00:38,085 --> 00:00:40,525
The way to a man's heart
is through his stomach.

10
00:00:41,845 --> 00:00:46,525
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

11
00:02:12,525 --> 00:02:15,484
EPISODE 9

12
00:02:48,765 --> 00:02:50,085
MISSED CALL FROM NAN

13
00:02:55,965 --> 00:02:59,045
Sorry. I forgot to let you know
that I've arrived home safely.

14
00:02:59,325 --> 00:03:01,285
Did you get in trouble
for getting home so late?

15
00:03:02,525 --> 00:03:04,365
Don't underestimate my acting skills.

16
00:03:04,445 --> 00:03:07,605
Before he could say anything,
I put on a pitiful show.

17
00:03:07,685 --> 00:03:10,005
He actually fell for it.

18
00:03:11,485 --> 00:03:12,805
What if he detects something?

19
00:03:13,205 --> 00:03:15,845
Truth becomes fiction
when the fiction is true.

20
00:03:16,245 --> 00:03:17,125
Plus,

21
00:03:17,485 --> 00:03:19,325
I have the greatest female weapon.

22
00:03:19,685 --> 00:03:21,325
He softened up the moment I cried.

23
00:03:21,885 --> 00:03:23,845
His attitude towards me is a lot better.

24
00:03:29,205 --> 00:03:30,645
Why are you back?

25
00:03:32,765 --> 00:03:33,645
Great acting.

26
00:03:45,605 --> 00:03:48,005
I didn't mean to act drunk last night.

27
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:52,205
Yes, I exaggerated my emotions a little,

28
00:03:52,845 --> 00:03:55,845
but I meant every word I said.

29
00:03:56,525 --> 00:03:57,485
No...

30
00:03:58,605 --> 00:04:00,565
I don't even believe myself.

31
00:04:01,085 --> 00:04:02,085
What should I do?

32
00:04:05,565 --> 00:04:06,405
Ms. Huang.

33
00:04:10,085 --> 00:04:11,085
Let me do it.

34
00:04:11,365 --> 00:04:12,285
Yes, ma'am.

35
00:04:18,325 --> 00:04:20,485
An Ran, when did you get here?

36
00:04:20,565 --> 00:04:21,645
I didn't see you come in.

37
00:04:21,725 --> 00:04:23,365
I got here before you woke up.

38
00:04:23,925 --> 00:04:26,084
Linlin, do you usually get up so late?

39
00:04:27,485 --> 00:04:30,005
I had insomnia last night
and didn't sleep well.

40
00:04:32,325 --> 00:04:33,325
Come with me.

41
00:04:33,605 --> 00:04:35,805
He doesn't like having people around
when he's working.

42
00:04:36,485 --> 00:04:38,885
I still have some things
to consult Yizhou about.

43
00:04:39,525 --> 00:04:42,485
You can go do your thing.
Don't worry about me.

44
00:04:43,645 --> 00:04:45,605
An Ran, I'll be direct with you.

45
00:04:45,885 --> 00:04:48,645
This is my house.
I don't want to see you here every day.

46
00:04:49,245 --> 00:04:51,645
I don't want you alone with my husband.

47
00:04:52,005 --> 00:04:54,525
But I'm worried about Yizhou, too.

48
00:04:54,885 --> 00:04:56,845
I just want to help you take care of him.

49
00:04:57,365 --> 00:04:59,085
Are you done? Get out.

50
00:05:00,565 --> 00:05:02,685
Did you hear that? He only needs me.

51
00:05:03,085 --> 00:05:04,845
-No need to trouble yourself.
-I meant you.

52
00:05:08,845 --> 00:05:10,245
You want me to leave?

53
00:05:10,685 --> 00:05:12,485
If you still want to be Mrs. Ling,

54
00:05:12,565 --> 00:05:14,885
stop all these little tricks
and act appropriately.

55
00:05:14,965 --> 00:05:16,285
Get out. Close the door for me.

56
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:26,325
I'M SORRY

57
00:05:28,725 --> 00:05:29,565
What's wrong?

58
00:05:32,085 --> 00:05:32,925
Nothing.

59
00:05:45,205 --> 00:05:47,085
I have to get rid of her.

60
00:05:58,885 --> 00:06:01,165
Hey, why didn't you book a private room?

61
00:06:01,245 --> 00:06:02,645
Looks like we're having an affair.

62
00:06:02,725 --> 00:06:05,405
Having an affair with my husband's
best friend? I'm not that crazy.

63
00:06:05,485 --> 00:06:06,445
Oh?

64
00:06:07,645 --> 00:06:09,725
-What kind of affair do you like?
-Don't interrupt me.

65
00:06:11,365 --> 00:06:13,685
It's fine that Ling Yizhou
lost his memory.

66
00:06:14,285 --> 00:06:15,885
But his whole temperament changed, too.

67
00:06:16,565 --> 00:06:19,045
He wasn't super affectionate before,

68
00:06:19,445 --> 00:06:21,805
but at least he wasn't this mean.

69
00:06:22,205 --> 00:06:23,485
Only you think it's strange.

70
00:06:24,405 --> 00:06:26,605
This is the normal Ling Yizhou.

71
00:06:27,165 --> 00:06:30,485
The doting Ling Yizhou was abnormal.

72
00:06:31,205 --> 00:06:32,845
Are you on my side or not?

73
00:06:33,725 --> 00:06:35,285
Don't try to lure me to your side.

74
00:06:35,365 --> 00:06:36,485
I'd never betray Ling.

75
00:06:39,565 --> 00:06:41,485
Helping me is helping Ling Yizhou.

76
00:06:41,805 --> 00:06:43,325
When his memory recovers,

77
00:06:43,405 --> 00:06:46,205
you'll be the hero
who helped save our marriage.

78
00:06:48,445 --> 00:06:49,285
How so?

79
00:06:52,925 --> 00:06:54,885
Do you want to marry An Ran?

80
00:06:55,245 --> 00:06:56,325
Who would want to marry her?

81
00:06:56,965 --> 00:06:59,245
I thought she was betrothed to you.

82
00:06:59,605 --> 00:07:01,205
You'll eventually have to marry someone.

83
00:07:01,285 --> 00:07:03,725
Might as well marry someone you know,
skip the break-in period.

84
00:07:05,165 --> 00:07:06,965
So, basically,

85
00:07:07,365 --> 00:07:11,765
you want to use me
to get An Ran away from Ling Yizhou.

86
00:07:12,365 --> 00:07:14,605
It's a win-win solution.
What do you think?

87
00:07:14,965 --> 00:07:16,005
No way!

88
00:07:20,725 --> 00:07:23,125
No way. I have no interest
in being someone's backup.

89
00:07:23,725 --> 00:07:25,205
I knew you'd turn me down.

90
00:07:25,645 --> 00:07:27,245
How stupid of me to ask you for help.

91
00:07:30,685 --> 00:07:31,525
Fine.

92
00:07:31,965 --> 00:07:34,165
You know what your biggest problem is?

93
00:07:35,005 --> 00:07:35,845
What?

94
00:07:37,405 --> 00:07:38,965
As a woman,

95
00:07:39,285 --> 00:07:41,565
you're not physically attractive at all.

96
00:07:42,565 --> 00:07:44,325
That's why even though you're married,

97
00:07:44,405 --> 00:07:45,565
An Ran hasn't given up yet.

98
00:07:49,325 --> 00:07:51,765
Superficial advantages
are the most vulnerable.

99
00:07:52,725 --> 00:07:55,925
Only smart people
appreciate my advantages.

100
00:07:56,485 --> 00:07:58,165
It's normal that someone as pompous as you

101
00:07:58,605 --> 00:07:59,925
can't understand what I mean.

102
00:08:02,365 --> 00:08:03,605
Who are you calling pompous?

103
00:08:04,685 --> 00:08:07,125
-Whoever responded.
-How am I pompous?

104
00:08:07,205 --> 00:08:09,685
I'm very low-key! I'm wearing black today.
How am I pompous?

105
00:08:09,765 --> 00:08:10,685
You know it best.

106
00:08:10,965 --> 00:08:12,485
I dare you to say that again.

107
00:08:12,565 --> 00:08:13,445
Think about it.

108
00:08:13,845 --> 00:08:14,685
You can't eat this.

109
00:08:14,765 --> 00:08:15,845
That's mine.

110
00:08:15,925 --> 00:08:17,845
You said I was pompous!

111
00:08:19,645 --> 00:08:20,485
Sir.

112
00:08:22,605 --> 00:08:24,365
We found Chu Yan. Have a look.

113
00:08:39,804 --> 00:08:42,445
Ms. Huang. What are you making?
It smells really good.

114
00:08:42,525 --> 00:08:43,365
Ma'am.

115
00:08:43,605 --> 00:08:46,085
Miss An made this healthy herbal soup
for Mr. Ling.

116
00:08:46,965 --> 00:08:49,125
She didn't even allow me to touch it.

117
00:08:49,965 --> 00:08:51,085
Big deal.

118
00:08:51,325 --> 00:08:54,005
It's not like Ling Yizhou
hasn't had soup before. What's the point?

119
00:08:54,765 --> 00:08:56,085
-Ms. Huang.
-Yes?

120
00:08:56,165 --> 00:08:58,125
Bring me some salt, vinegar, and sugar.

121
00:08:59,245 --> 00:09:00,285
But Ma'am, you--

122
00:09:00,365 --> 00:09:02,205
Just do it. I'll take full responsibility.

123
00:09:02,605 --> 00:09:03,445
OK.

124
00:09:13,805 --> 00:09:14,685
Wait.

125
00:09:16,605 --> 00:09:19,565
Ruining this soup would be such a waste.

126
00:09:26,885 --> 00:09:27,925
I'm so full.

127
00:09:30,125 --> 00:09:31,925
Pidan, you're good.

128
00:09:32,005 --> 00:09:33,365
You've been eating non-stop.

129
00:09:33,845 --> 00:09:35,045
Is it that good?

130
00:09:39,565 --> 00:09:42,245
One last chicken wing.

131
00:09:42,525 --> 00:09:43,565
For you!

132
00:09:45,285 --> 00:09:46,125
What are you doing?

133
00:09:49,205 --> 00:09:51,765
Linlin, how could you mess around
with my soup?

134
00:09:52,165 --> 00:09:53,325
You made this soup?

135
00:09:54,045 --> 00:09:57,685
I thought Ms. Huang had messed up.
Even Pidan didn't like it.

136
00:09:57,965 --> 00:09:58,805
That's OK.

137
00:09:59,245 --> 00:10:01,605
It means that your cooking
still has room for improvement.

138
00:10:02,605 --> 00:10:05,605
Pidan, let's go find
yummier food elsewhere.

139
00:10:16,445 --> 00:10:17,285
What's going on?

140
00:10:18,325 --> 00:10:19,165
Nothing.

141
00:10:19,445 --> 00:10:23,005
The dog finished the soup
that I spent all morning making.

142
00:10:23,285 --> 00:10:24,405
I'm a little upset.

143
00:10:24,685 --> 00:10:27,605
Don't be.
I'm kind of sick of soup anyway.

144
00:10:29,165 --> 00:10:30,085
Yizhou.

145
00:10:30,165 --> 00:10:32,245
I have something going on this afternoon.

146
00:10:32,325 --> 00:10:34,045
I won't be able to join you for lunch.

147
00:10:49,085 --> 00:10:52,525
Ma'am, if you don't feel well,
you should stay at home.

148
00:10:53,325 --> 00:10:56,765
I slept too much yesterday,
so my body is aching.

149
00:10:58,845 --> 00:11:01,725
Call me if you feel unwell.

150
00:11:02,125 --> 00:11:03,645
OK.

151
00:11:19,325 --> 00:11:20,205
Yizhou.

152
00:11:21,805 --> 00:11:23,285
Can't you knock before you come in?

153
00:11:24,445 --> 00:11:27,085
I forgot.

154
00:11:27,165 --> 00:11:28,765
We're close. Do you care about that?

155
00:11:28,845 --> 00:11:32,205
An Ran, if Xia Lin was here
with me in this room,

156
00:11:32,285 --> 00:11:33,885
what you just did would be disrespectful.

157
00:11:37,605 --> 00:11:38,525
Yizhou,

158
00:11:38,925 --> 00:11:40,925
are you getting your memory back?

159
00:11:41,645 --> 00:11:42,925
Are you worried about that?

160
00:11:43,845 --> 00:11:45,165
Why would I be worried?

161
00:11:45,245 --> 00:11:47,205
It would be wonderful if it happened.

162
00:11:47,765 --> 00:11:51,325
Actually, Linlin and I used to be close.

163
00:11:51,525 --> 00:11:52,925
I'm not sure why,

164
00:11:53,005 --> 00:11:55,685
but ever since the accident,
she has been very hostile towards me.

165
00:11:57,805 --> 00:11:59,725
Although I haven't fully accepted it,

166
00:12:00,405 --> 00:12:01,565
our marriage is a fact.

167
00:12:02,525 --> 00:12:04,725
You are my friend,
so you should accept it as well.

168
00:12:05,765 --> 00:12:08,405
Fine. You've always liked to lecture me.

169
00:12:09,525 --> 00:12:13,045
I brewed a pot of herbal tea for you.
Try it.

170
00:12:14,205 --> 00:12:16,005
I have no appetite. You can have it.

171
00:12:16,445 --> 00:12:19,325
You said you were tired of soup,
so I made you some tea instead.

172
00:12:20,005 --> 00:12:21,285
Please don't turn me down.

173
00:12:34,045 --> 00:12:34,885
What's that smell?

174
00:12:35,765 --> 00:12:37,685
Mostly herbal ingredients.

175
00:12:37,765 --> 00:12:39,285
It's best to drink it while it's hot.

176
00:12:45,485 --> 00:12:46,885
An Ran.

177
00:12:47,445 --> 00:12:49,685
I left my cell phone in the study.
Can you get it for me?

178
00:12:50,845 --> 00:12:52,925
Sure.

179
00:12:53,405 --> 00:12:54,765
Drink it while it's still hot.

180
00:13:22,725 --> 00:13:23,925
I'M SORRY

181
00:13:28,645 --> 00:13:30,765
Sir, I can't seem to wake Mrs. Ling up.

182
00:13:30,845 --> 00:13:32,845
I'm worried that she might be sick.

183
00:13:38,245 --> 00:13:39,565
Has she ever been like this?

184
00:13:40,205 --> 00:13:41,165
Never.

185
00:13:41,605 --> 00:13:43,045
I find it strange because

186
00:13:43,125 --> 00:13:44,765
Pidan has also been sleeping
all afternoon.

187
00:13:47,325 --> 00:13:48,725
Call Doctor Wang.

188
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:52,005
We found traces of hypnotics
in Mrs. Ling's blood sample.

189
00:13:52,765 --> 00:13:56,125
Thankfully, it wasn't enough
to cause any real harm.

190
00:14:20,005 --> 00:14:23,445
Yizhou, you finished it all?

191
00:14:26,245 --> 00:14:29,205
Yeah. It's not bad, but I'm feeling
really sleepy for some reason.

192
00:14:31,045 --> 00:14:33,565
Why don't you lie down and take a nap?

193
00:14:59,245 --> 00:15:01,085
Have I seen this necklace before?

194
00:15:02,445 --> 00:15:04,165
No, Yizhou.

195
00:15:04,605 --> 00:15:07,765
Close your eyes and relax. Go to sleep.

196
00:15:10,045 --> 00:15:11,285
Starting now,

197
00:15:11,885 --> 00:15:14,445
I want you to listen to me closely.

198
00:15:17,285 --> 00:15:18,245
What are you doing?

199
00:15:19,445 --> 00:15:22,485
Linlin, Yizhou is asleep.

200
00:15:23,285 --> 00:15:24,525
I'm just about to leave.

201
00:15:25,285 --> 00:15:27,205
An Ran, I know you like Ling Yizhou.

202
00:15:27,565 --> 00:15:29,045
But he's married.

203
00:15:29,125 --> 00:15:30,565
If he didn't love you in the past,

204
00:15:30,645 --> 00:15:32,685
he won't fall in love with you now.

205
00:15:33,245 --> 00:15:35,325
So, put away all of your useless thoughts.

206
00:15:35,805 --> 00:15:37,925
And stop showing up
at my house all the time.

207
00:15:38,285 --> 00:15:39,445
Don't ever come over again.

208
00:15:39,925 --> 00:15:42,845
Xia Lin, without those tricks of yours,

209
00:15:43,485 --> 00:15:45,765
you would never have appeared
in our lives.

210
00:15:46,125 --> 00:15:47,485
I'll help Yizhou understand...

211
00:15:48,525 --> 00:15:50,245
that you don't deserve him.

212
00:15:51,285 --> 00:15:54,285
I love him the most.

213
00:15:54,645 --> 00:15:55,805
You love him,

214
00:15:55,885 --> 00:15:57,805
but you don't dare tell him.

215
00:15:57,885 --> 00:15:59,765
That's because you're afraid
of being rejected.

216
00:16:00,245 --> 00:16:03,325
An Ran, even if I wasn't here,
he still wouldn't love you.

217
00:16:03,405 --> 00:16:06,045
But I'm the only one
who's been by his side all these years.

218
00:16:06,325 --> 00:16:09,005
You've only known him for a few months.

219
00:16:09,405 --> 00:16:12,045
Relationships cannot be measured
by length of time.

220
00:16:12,365 --> 00:16:13,605
He didn't love you then,

221
00:16:13,685 --> 00:16:14,845
and he won't love you now.

222
00:16:20,445 --> 00:16:21,765
I'm going to rest with my husband.

223
00:16:22,245 --> 00:16:23,285
Are you going to watch?

224
00:16:35,245 --> 00:16:36,885
OK, you can stop pretending. She's gone.

225
00:16:40,045 --> 00:16:40,885
Ling Yizhou.

226
00:16:44,685 --> 00:16:46,245
Did you really fall asleep?

227
00:16:48,205 --> 00:16:50,485
How dare you bring another woman
into our bedroom?

228
00:16:50,565 --> 00:16:52,325
You are way out of line.

229
00:16:56,725 --> 00:16:58,885
You're not asleep. You tricked me.

230
00:16:58,965 --> 00:17:00,045
It's too easy to fool you.

231
00:17:21,285 --> 00:17:22,165
Hey.

232
00:17:23,045 --> 00:17:23,885
Wen Li.

233
00:17:36,925 --> 00:17:40,765
Director Ling, the tea you brought over
also contained traces of hypnotics.

234
00:17:40,845 --> 00:17:42,805
The dosage could knock
a person out for 24 hours.

235
00:17:44,005 --> 00:17:46,685
Doctor Wang,
in addition to external injury,

236
00:17:47,405 --> 00:17:50,845
are there any other possible causes
of memory loss?

237
00:17:51,645 --> 00:17:53,405
Speaking of hypnotics...

238
00:17:53,805 --> 00:17:56,085
there is another possibility.

239
00:18:01,725 --> 00:18:02,805
Sir.

240
00:18:03,245 --> 00:18:04,085
Sir.

241
00:18:06,365 --> 00:18:07,205
We're here.

242
00:18:08,885 --> 00:18:12,565
Look into An Ran's whereabouts
before the car accident.

243
00:18:13,285 --> 00:18:14,125
Yes, sir.

244
00:18:16,125 --> 00:18:17,165
MRS. LING CALLING

245
00:18:18,245 --> 00:18:19,085
It's Mrs. Ling.

246
00:18:20,045 --> 00:18:21,045
Put it on speaker mode.

247
00:18:24,445 --> 00:18:26,365
Hello, Mrs. Ling. How can I help you?

248
00:18:26,965 --> 00:18:28,165
<i>Did I interrupt your work?</i>

249
00:18:28,605 --> 00:18:30,365
No. What can I do for you, ma'am?

250
00:18:31,525 --> 00:18:33,365
<i>Is Ling Yizhou at the office?</i>

251
00:18:34,365 --> 00:18:36,845
He's in a meeting right now.
Would you like to speak to him?

252
00:18:37,245 --> 00:18:38,925
<i>No, it's OK. Don't worry.</i>

253
00:18:39,165 --> 00:18:40,005
Alright.

254
00:18:42,205 --> 00:18:43,965
Since when did you start working for her?

255
00:18:44,565 --> 00:18:46,925
Please. I'd never betray you, Mr. Ling.

256
00:18:48,645 --> 00:18:51,245
I've only caught people in bed
when I was acting.

257
00:18:51,325 --> 00:18:54,165
Now, I get the chance
to do it in real life.

258
00:18:54,885 --> 00:18:57,045
I don't think Mr. Ling
is the cheating type.

259
00:18:57,565 --> 00:18:59,805
My dear, you're still young.

260
00:18:59,885 --> 00:19:02,445
Reality is always crueler
than what we think.

261
00:19:02,525 --> 00:19:03,765
I still bet he's faithful.

262
00:19:04,045 --> 00:19:05,965
I think he'd never cheat on Mrs. Ling.

263
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:07,645
I give up my vote.

264
00:19:07,725 --> 00:19:10,445
Men at the top of the pyramid
have a mysterious power.

265
00:19:11,125 --> 00:19:13,165
You never know what they're thinking.

266
00:19:13,245 --> 00:19:16,325
That's also the main reason
women like them.

267
00:19:17,085 --> 00:19:18,645
I never said he would cheat.

268
00:19:19,125 --> 00:19:21,725
I'm just testing his loyalty.

269
00:19:22,685 --> 00:19:24,645
Want me to get information from Wen Li?

270
00:19:25,245 --> 00:19:26,485
That works for small things.

271
00:19:26,725 --> 00:19:28,365
But for this, he's not only useless,

272
00:19:28,645 --> 00:19:30,245
he might even give us away.

273
00:19:31,285 --> 00:19:34,245
That makes sense.
I'll go home and think about

274
00:19:34,325 --> 00:19:36,205
how he can be useful to us.

275
00:19:37,125 --> 00:19:38,165
Isn't that Mr. Ling?

276
00:19:41,285 --> 00:19:42,805
Wen Li, you hypocrite.

277
00:19:52,885 --> 00:19:54,645
-Miss Xia?
-You are?

278
00:19:55,045 --> 00:19:57,085
My boss would like
to invite you to his house.

279
00:19:57,645 --> 00:19:58,925
Who's your boss?

280
00:19:59,325 --> 00:20:00,245
Chu Yan's father.

281
00:20:00,645 --> 00:20:02,645
Why does Chu Yan's father want to see you?

282
00:20:03,205 --> 00:20:05,965
I don't know him,
so I'm not coming with you.

283
00:20:06,045 --> 00:20:08,205
-Excuse me. Sorry about the trouble.
-Miss Xia, wait.

284
00:20:08,285 --> 00:20:11,725
What are you doing? Trying to kidnap her
in the middle of the day?

285
00:20:12,405 --> 00:20:14,005
You've misunderstood, Miss Xia.

286
00:20:14,485 --> 00:20:16,925
My boss is extending a sincere invitation.

287
00:20:17,245 --> 00:20:19,845
If he wanted me to kidnap you,
I wouldn't be asking you politely.

288
00:20:23,725 --> 00:20:25,045
Call Ling Yizhou and Chu Yan.

289
00:20:27,405 --> 00:20:28,445
Fine. I'll go with you.

290
00:20:28,525 --> 00:20:30,085
Mrs. Ling, let me go with you, too.

291
00:20:30,925 --> 00:20:33,765
I'm sorry. My boss only invited Miss Xia.

292
00:20:35,445 --> 00:20:37,445
I'll be fine. You guys can go now.

293
00:20:38,325 --> 00:20:39,525
Miss Xia, please.

294
00:20:51,485 --> 00:20:52,925
<i>Can't you leave me alone for one day?</i>

295
00:20:53,005 --> 00:20:55,765
Mr. Chu, Linlin is in trouble.

296
00:21:01,805 --> 00:21:03,405
Sir, Miss Xia is here.

297
00:21:05,405 --> 00:21:07,965
Mr. Chu, why did you want to see me?

298
00:21:08,485 --> 00:21:10,365
It seems that Miss Xia
is quite straightforward.

299
00:21:11,005 --> 00:21:12,565
I'll get to the point then.

300
00:21:12,645 --> 00:21:13,765
I am Chu Yan's father.

301
00:21:14,845 --> 00:21:17,365
I already have
a potential daughter-in-law in mind.

302
00:21:18,765 --> 00:21:20,965
I would not allow him
to be entangled with any other woman

303
00:21:21,045 --> 00:21:22,285
or be involved in any scandal.

304
00:21:22,685 --> 00:21:24,245
Mr. Chu, I think you've misunderstood.

305
00:21:24,565 --> 00:21:26,445
Chu Yan is my senior at the agency.

306
00:21:26,525 --> 00:21:28,925
We're just friends.

307
00:21:29,005 --> 00:21:29,965
That's good.

308
00:21:31,365 --> 00:21:32,565
Chu Yan is my only son.

309
00:21:33,965 --> 00:21:36,325
I won't allow his life
to be ruined by anything or anyone.

310
00:21:36,845 --> 00:21:38,045
Mr. Chu, rest assured.

311
00:21:38,125 --> 00:21:39,605
I already have someone I like.

312
00:21:39,685 --> 00:21:40,885
That person is not Chu Yan.

313
00:21:50,005 --> 00:21:52,285
Shouldn't you be having tea
with Miss Liang right now?

314
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:55,805
That was smart to make sure
I wouldn't be here.

315
00:21:56,485 --> 00:21:58,885
But, as one of the main characters,
how could I miss out?

316
00:21:58,965 --> 00:22:01,405
Mr. Chu invited me over as a guest.

317
00:22:01,485 --> 00:22:02,565
As a guest?

318
00:22:03,445 --> 00:22:06,045
Then why haven't you
been offered a cup of tea?

319
00:22:06,405 --> 00:22:08,965
Does the Chu family lack basic etiquette?

320
00:22:09,925 --> 00:22:10,965
How dare you?

321
00:22:11,485 --> 00:22:14,045
Since you had the nerve to come here,
let me be clear about this.

322
00:22:14,525 --> 00:22:16,245
Stay away from this woman in the future.

323
00:22:16,325 --> 00:22:18,485
Or I'll make sure you never see her again.

324
00:22:19,245 --> 00:22:21,525
Mr. Chu, there's nothing between us.

325
00:22:21,605 --> 00:22:24,085
But even if there was,
you have no right to control his life.

326
00:22:24,645 --> 00:22:25,805
This is none of your business.

327
00:22:26,645 --> 00:22:28,045
Remember what you promised me.

328
00:22:28,125 --> 00:22:31,245
If you keep your word, you can keep
enjoying the life you have now.

329
00:22:31,765 --> 00:22:33,525
I can also promise you other things.

330
00:22:33,805 --> 00:22:36,605
Whatever you offer, I can offer too.
There are others who can as well.

331
00:22:36,685 --> 00:22:39,045
You're not the only person
with power in this world.

332
00:22:41,085 --> 00:22:41,925
Are you done?

333
00:22:42,285 --> 00:22:43,125
He's done. Let's go.

334
00:22:50,845 --> 00:22:52,485
Don't you dare leave this house!

335
00:22:55,325 --> 00:22:57,085
Yan, don't do this.

336
00:23:01,725 --> 00:23:02,925
I'll take you to the doctor.

337
00:23:03,285 --> 00:23:05,765
I'm fine. Thank you for coming.

338
00:23:06,445 --> 00:23:07,445
We're even now.

339
00:23:07,685 --> 00:23:09,645
Why did you take the blow for me?
Are you stupid?

340
00:23:10,325 --> 00:23:11,165
Mumu.

341
00:23:13,965 --> 00:23:14,805
Are you hurt?

342
00:23:15,085 --> 00:23:16,045
I'm fine.

343
00:23:22,125 --> 00:23:22,965
Ling Yizhou.

344
00:23:24,765 --> 00:23:25,805
What's going on?

345
00:23:25,885 --> 00:23:27,485
Mr. Chu, I should be the one asking you.

346
00:23:28,045 --> 00:23:29,805
You invited my wife to your house.

347
00:23:30,485 --> 00:23:31,405
What do you want?

348
00:23:31,925 --> 00:23:33,245
-Your wife?
-Yes.

349
00:23:34,885 --> 00:23:36,005
Xia Lin is my wife.

350
00:23:36,405 --> 00:23:38,365
Didn't you investigate
before you invited her?

351
00:23:39,405 --> 00:23:40,245
Mr. Fu?

352
00:23:41,645 --> 00:23:43,005
This is all my fault.

353
00:23:44,045 --> 00:23:45,565
-So Miss Xia is Mrs. Ling.
-I'm fine.

354
00:23:46,485 --> 00:23:48,805
Chu Yan didn't even inform me
of such wonderful news.

355
00:23:49,565 --> 00:23:51,045
This was all a misunderstanding.

356
00:23:51,445 --> 00:23:52,365
Misunderstanding?

357
00:23:56,685 --> 00:23:58,565
Mr. Chu. Do you think saying that

358
00:23:58,645 --> 00:24:02,085
could cancel out the pain
that my wife has suffered?

359
00:24:03,245 --> 00:24:04,085
Next time.

360
00:24:04,485 --> 00:24:06,405
I'll visit you next time
to apologize officially.

361
00:24:06,765 --> 00:24:09,285
If you're still not willing
to forgive me then,

362
00:24:09,365 --> 00:24:11,405
-you should do so for Chu Yan's sake.
-No need.

363
00:24:11,965 --> 00:24:12,965
Living under your roof,

364
00:24:13,405 --> 00:24:15,285
I've never been treated
with respect anyway.

365
00:24:16,045 --> 00:24:17,045
No need to come visit.

366
00:24:17,645 --> 00:24:20,045
I'll have someone handle
our business matters ASAP.

367
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:21,485
We'll let the past go,

368
00:24:21,565 --> 00:24:22,925
but as for our unfinished deals,

369
00:24:23,005 --> 00:24:25,085
I'll pay the penalty fees
for breaching our contract.

370
00:24:26,285 --> 00:24:29,405
From now on, we will only be competitors.
We're never working together again.

371
00:24:54,205 --> 00:24:55,325
Are you done hugging me?

372
00:24:55,645 --> 00:24:56,885
I'm afraid once I let go,

373
00:24:57,325 --> 00:25:00,365
you'll turn into the Ling Yizhou
I don't know anymore.

374
00:25:02,805 --> 00:25:04,125
How long did Chu Yan hold you?

375
00:25:04,445 --> 00:25:05,285
Are you jealous?

376
00:25:07,765 --> 00:25:08,605
Rest assured.

377
00:25:08,845 --> 00:25:11,045
Next time,
no matter how seriously injured,

378
00:25:11,125 --> 00:25:12,525
I'll never let anyone else hold me.

379
00:25:12,805 --> 00:25:13,925
There won't be a next time.

380
00:25:14,405 --> 00:25:16,085
I should have showed up earlier today.

381
00:25:17,605 --> 00:25:19,885
All that matters is that you showed up.
Being late is OK.

382
00:25:24,365 --> 00:25:27,125
Ling Yizhou. Even though
you haven't got your memory back yet,

383
00:25:27,765 --> 00:25:30,365
you don't hate me as much now, do you?

384
00:25:38,325 --> 00:25:39,525
Never mind, don't answer.

385
00:25:40,125 --> 00:25:41,845
The truth will probably make me sad.

386
00:25:42,365 --> 00:25:43,645
I don't want you to lie to me.

387
00:25:46,125 --> 00:25:47,885
Where is Mr. Wen?

388
00:25:49,845 --> 00:25:51,125
He is busy with something else.

389
00:26:03,725 --> 00:26:07,245
Ms. Huang, come rescue my back.

390
00:26:12,325 --> 00:26:14,285
Why are you here?

391
00:26:14,485 --> 00:26:15,445
Ms. Huang is asleep.

392
00:26:16,885 --> 00:26:17,965
Let me help you.

393
00:26:18,245 --> 00:26:19,805
You still whine like a baby?

394
00:26:21,125 --> 00:26:21,965
No...

395
00:26:22,485 --> 00:26:23,445
I...

396
00:26:23,525 --> 00:26:24,365
You...

397
00:26:24,885 --> 00:26:26,645
This is a bit awkward.

398
00:26:26,725 --> 00:26:27,605
Why is it awkward?

399
00:26:27,885 --> 00:26:30,405
You always say that you're Mrs. Ling,
and I'm your husband.

400
00:26:30,725 --> 00:26:32,845
Isn't it normal
for a husband to help his wife?

401
00:26:32,925 --> 00:26:34,365
Alright, take your clothes off.

402
00:26:34,925 --> 00:26:38,565
No. That's too...

403
00:26:39,445 --> 00:26:41,325
I don't really need medicine.

404
00:26:42,645 --> 00:26:43,645
I guess you don't.

405
00:26:45,205 --> 00:26:48,285
But if your back doesn't heal properly,
you won't be able to wear bikinis

406
00:26:48,925 --> 00:26:50,205
or show off your back anymore.

407
00:26:50,285 --> 00:26:53,085
You'd only be able to wear ugly clothes
for future events.

408
00:27:00,245 --> 00:27:01,085
Fine.

409
00:27:23,125 --> 00:27:24,645
-Ling Yizhou.
-Yeah?

410
00:27:25,925 --> 00:27:27,405
I like you.

411
00:27:28,365 --> 00:27:30,565
I like you more than I thought I would.

412
00:27:31,245 --> 00:27:32,085
Don't move.

413
00:27:32,645 --> 00:27:35,965
If you look at me,
I won't be able to tell you this.

414
00:27:37,805 --> 00:27:39,445
If I miss out on this chance,

415
00:27:40,285 --> 00:27:44,845
I don't know
if you'll be nice to me again.

416
00:27:46,765 --> 00:27:48,205
I regret it now.

417
00:27:48,965 --> 00:27:50,845
I should have told you that I like you

418
00:27:50,925 --> 00:27:54,965
when you still remembered me.

419
00:27:59,205 --> 00:28:00,485
I'm afraid, too.

420
00:28:01,525 --> 00:28:06,045
What if you never remember me
and never like me again?

421
00:28:09,605 --> 00:28:11,965
In my 22 years of life,

422
00:28:12,045 --> 00:28:13,565
you're my first crush.

423
00:28:15,965 --> 00:28:19,885
I can't give up on the love
you once gave me.

424
00:28:31,125 --> 00:28:35,365
If there's no one
in your heart right now...

425
00:28:36,805 --> 00:28:38,965
could you give yourself a chance...

426
00:28:40,405 --> 00:28:43,285
to get to know me, like me,

427
00:28:44,045 --> 00:28:47,445
or even fall in love with me?

428
00:28:55,605 --> 00:28:57,245
You shouldn't have told me this.

429
00:29:00,565 --> 00:29:02,405
I'm sorry. I won't bring it up again.

430
00:29:23,005 --> 00:29:24,005
You...

431
00:29:26,045 --> 00:29:27,325
Why did you kiss me?

432
00:29:27,725 --> 00:29:28,965
We've kissed before.

433
00:29:30,485 --> 00:29:32,005
What do you mean?

434
00:29:33,365 --> 00:29:35,365
The Mr. Ling you know...

435
00:29:36,565 --> 00:29:38,565
heard his wife's confession of love.

436
00:29:39,925 --> 00:29:41,165
He wants me to tell you that

437
00:29:41,245 --> 00:29:43,325
he's really happy.

438
00:29:45,645 --> 00:29:47,325
A man should always
confess his love first.

439
00:29:48,885 --> 00:29:49,965
You remember everything now?

440
00:29:51,805 --> 00:29:54,205
Mumu, I love you.

441
00:29:55,685 --> 00:29:57,285
I love you more than I thought I would.

442
00:31:10,845 --> 00:31:14,085
<i>Mrs. Ling, would you please move</i>
<i>into the master bedroom? Your Mr. Ling.</i>

443
00:31:54,165 --> 00:31:55,085
Yizhou.

444
00:31:55,885 --> 00:31:58,365
Why are we meeting here?

445
00:32:01,325 --> 00:32:02,685
I've been here before, haven't I?

446
00:32:03,045 --> 00:32:04,165
Have you?

447
00:32:11,685 --> 00:32:14,125
The day I had the car accident,
you brought me here.

448
00:32:16,125 --> 00:32:19,165
Yizhou, when I found you that day,

449
00:32:19,485 --> 00:32:21,085
you were already unconscious.

450
00:32:21,605 --> 00:32:25,205
Why would I bring you here
instead of rushing you to the hospital?

451
00:32:26,565 --> 00:32:28,765
It's so dark and eerie here.

452
00:32:29,605 --> 00:32:31,525
-Let's head out.
-Relax.

453
00:32:33,645 --> 00:32:34,805
Let's listen to this first.

454
00:32:39,285 --> 00:32:40,645
<i>Your wife came to me.</i>

455
00:32:40,725 --> 00:32:43,085
<i>She wanted you to forget</i>
<i>a woman named Xia Lin.</i>

456
00:32:43,165 --> 00:32:45,125
<i>She said she was trying</i>
<i>to ruin your marriage.</i>

457
00:32:47,245 --> 00:32:49,205
This person is
a well-known therapist in Gangdong.

458
00:32:50,245 --> 00:32:51,445
She is also a hypnotherapist.

459
00:32:53,005 --> 00:32:56,005
After I had the accident,
you took me to see her, didn't you?

460
00:32:56,285 --> 00:32:58,125
No, I didn't!

461
00:33:02,405 --> 00:33:04,885
Yizhou. You have to trust me.

462
00:33:05,245 --> 00:33:07,085
I wouldn't do anything to hurt you.

463
00:33:09,965 --> 00:33:12,085
You put sleeping drugs in my food.

464
00:33:13,165 --> 00:33:14,805
That's what you mean by not hurting me?

465
00:33:20,445 --> 00:33:21,805
You lied to the hypnotherapist.

466
00:33:22,525 --> 00:33:25,325
You had her erase my memory of
the past two years. That's not hurting me?

467
00:33:27,405 --> 00:33:28,245
An Ran...

468
00:33:30,125 --> 00:33:32,205
What happened to you?

469
00:33:33,205 --> 00:33:35,405
What happened to me?

470
00:33:35,645 --> 00:33:37,565
You two did this to me.

471
00:33:40,125 --> 00:33:41,045
Us two?

472
00:33:42,565 --> 00:33:43,445
Yes.

473
00:33:44,285 --> 00:33:45,925
I arranged all this.

474
00:33:47,045 --> 00:33:48,685
If Xia Lin never appeared in your life,

475
00:33:49,405 --> 00:33:51,205
even if you never fell in love with me,

476
00:33:51,805 --> 00:33:54,325
at least we could be
the way we were before.

477
00:33:57,325 --> 00:33:59,365
But even when I forgot about her,

478
00:34:00,045 --> 00:34:01,845
you still put sleeping drugs
in my soup. Why?

479
00:34:03,045 --> 00:34:04,765
Because I was afraid.

480
00:34:05,045 --> 00:34:07,765
I was afraid that you'd remember her
and fall in love with her again.

481
00:34:10,245 --> 00:34:12,045
I had to take the risk.

482
00:34:13,805 --> 00:34:15,644
I had to hypnotize you again

483
00:34:16,445 --> 00:34:18,244
to make sure the memories stayed erased.

484
00:34:19,045 --> 00:34:20,765
If she'd stay away from you,

485
00:34:21,684 --> 00:34:23,405
if she'd stop pestering you,

486
00:34:23,644 --> 00:34:25,605
I wouldn't have to do it.

487
00:34:30,965 --> 00:34:31,805
An Ran...

488
00:34:33,125 --> 00:34:35,285
You're like a little sister to me.
We grew up together.

489
00:34:36,565 --> 00:34:38,005
But now I barely recognize you.

490
00:34:38,845 --> 00:34:40,925
I never wanted to be your little sister!

491
00:34:41,005 --> 00:34:42,485
Then we can only be strangers.

492
00:34:44,644 --> 00:34:46,365
No! Yizhou...

493
00:34:46,445 --> 00:34:47,565
Yizhou...

494
00:34:49,045 --> 00:34:51,405
I'll accept your marriage with Xia Lin.

495
00:34:51,925 --> 00:34:54,125
Please just let me stay by your side.

496
00:34:59,244 --> 00:35:00,525
I don't care if you accept it.

497
00:35:01,525 --> 00:35:03,005
Are you really going to throw away...

498
00:35:04,165 --> 00:35:06,645
our many years of friendship for her sake?

499
00:35:07,165 --> 00:35:08,085
It's not for her sake.

500
00:35:10,045 --> 00:35:12,765
An Ran, you made a mistake.

501
00:35:13,765 --> 00:35:15,245
Because of our friendship,

502
00:35:16,125 --> 00:35:17,965
I won't continue investigating the matter.

503
00:35:19,125 --> 00:35:20,965
But if you keep making mistakes...

504
00:35:22,925 --> 00:35:25,045
I can't guarantee I won't take action.

505
00:35:28,885 --> 00:35:32,005
Yizhou. Don't leave me!

506
00:35:39,165 --> 00:35:40,485
Let me ask you another question.

507
00:35:41,925 --> 00:35:44,525
Did you have anything
to do with the car accident?

508
00:35:45,245 --> 00:35:49,045
What's the point of asking this now?

509
00:35:51,085 --> 00:35:51,925
An Ran...

510
00:35:53,645 --> 00:35:57,245
Don't destroy my last bit
of affection for you.

511
00:36:03,725 --> 00:36:05,205
Yizhou...

512
00:36:05,525 --> 00:36:09,365
I didn't do it. It wasn't me.

513
00:36:23,365 --> 00:36:24,285
You lost.

514
00:36:28,645 --> 00:36:29,925
I don't need you to remind me.

515
00:36:48,405 --> 00:36:49,485
You scared me!

516
00:36:50,125 --> 00:36:52,365
What is there to be afraid of?
This is our bedroom.

517
00:36:52,445 --> 00:36:53,685
Nobody else can come in here.

518
00:36:55,645 --> 00:36:57,885
Be honest with me. Where have you been?

519
00:36:59,405 --> 00:37:01,045
How will I benefit from telling you?

520
00:37:06,245 --> 00:37:07,085
Not enough.

521
00:37:10,525 --> 00:37:11,365
Still not enough.

522
00:37:12,405 --> 00:37:13,805
You're so greedy.

523
00:37:14,205 --> 00:37:16,445
I'll find out on my own.

524
00:37:16,805 --> 00:37:17,725
From Wen Li?

525
00:37:18,325 --> 00:37:19,725
He's only loyal to you.

526
00:37:19,805 --> 00:37:21,845
He reports the tiniest things to you.

527
00:37:22,125 --> 00:37:23,765
He's my buddy, just like Chu Yan.

528
00:37:24,205 --> 00:37:28,405
Would you be devastated
if Mr. Wen chose to side with me one day?

529
00:37:29,005 --> 00:37:29,885
You can try.

530
00:37:37,885 --> 00:37:38,725
<i>Mrs. Ling.</i>

531
00:37:38,805 --> 00:37:39,805
Hello, Mr. Wen.

532
00:37:40,165 --> 00:37:41,485
Is Ling Yizhou at the office?

533
00:37:41,565 --> 00:37:42,965
I can't get hold of him.

534
00:37:43,045 --> 00:37:44,085
<i>Mr. Ling is in a meeting.</i>

535
00:37:44,485 --> 00:37:45,925
<i>Should I have him call you back?</i>

536
00:37:47,325 --> 00:37:48,925
It's alright. No worries.

537
00:38:00,805 --> 00:38:02,445
WEN LI:
MRS. LING IS LOOKING FOR YOU

538
00:38:04,565 --> 00:38:06,285
If you have any questions in the future,

539
00:38:06,845 --> 00:38:08,285
you should just come to me directly.

540
00:38:08,965 --> 00:38:11,485
Did you two work together
and lie to me yesterday?

541
00:38:12,245 --> 00:38:14,685
He said you were in a meeting,
but you weren't at the office.

542
00:38:17,005 --> 00:38:18,685
We went to see a hypnotist.

543
00:38:19,525 --> 00:38:20,605
To restore my memory.

544
00:38:21,485 --> 00:38:22,525
A hypnotist?

545
00:38:23,005 --> 00:38:24,965
The car accident didn't cause my amnesia.

546
00:38:25,805 --> 00:38:26,965
It was caused by hypnosis.

547
00:38:28,245 --> 00:38:29,165
Is An Ran behind this?

548
00:38:30,925 --> 00:38:32,005
I confronted her.

549
00:38:32,725 --> 00:38:33,845
Don't worry.

550
00:38:34,565 --> 00:38:36,685
She'll never appear in our lives again.

551
00:38:39,685 --> 00:38:42,205
I'm sorry.

552
00:38:42,685 --> 00:38:44,205
Our relationship has cost you a friend.

553
00:38:44,725 --> 00:38:45,725
It's not your fault.

554
00:38:46,285 --> 00:38:48,805
She made the wrong decisions.

555
00:38:51,605 --> 00:38:53,245
But you still have to make it up to me.

556
00:38:55,125 --> 00:38:56,165
No, wait.

557
00:38:57,125 --> 00:38:59,085
You got your memory back
a while ago, didn't you?

558
00:38:59,165 --> 00:39:00,805
Were you acting?

559
00:39:01,445 --> 00:39:04,605
How else would Mumu confess
her love for me?

560
00:39:05,525 --> 00:39:07,565
Ling Yizhou, you liar!

561
00:39:15,445 --> 00:39:17,765
Hello everyone.
Welcome to <i>The Amazing Idol</i>.

562
00:39:18,445 --> 00:39:20,965
Today, we've invited Yin Shuangshuang...

563
00:39:22,845 --> 00:39:23,685
Chu Yan...

564
00:39:24,965 --> 00:39:26,245
and Xia Lin as our guests.

565
00:39:27,965 --> 00:39:30,285
In this episode,
we'll be testing our guests' reactions.

566
00:39:30,365 --> 00:39:31,885
I have three cards in my hand.

567
00:39:31,965 --> 00:39:33,245
Each has a different task.

568
00:39:33,605 --> 00:39:36,485
You have to complete the task
on the card you pick.

569
00:39:57,525 --> 00:39:59,205
Look at Linlin's expression.

570
00:39:59,285 --> 00:40:00,845
Can you show us what your task is?

571
00:40:05,685 --> 00:40:08,245
"Call someone of the opposite sex
who is not on set

572
00:40:08,325 --> 00:40:10,245
and make them say 'I love you.'"

573
00:40:10,805 --> 00:40:12,605
Can someone bring
Xia Lin's phone on stage?

574
00:40:18,085 --> 00:40:19,645
Can I have a few minutes?

575
00:40:19,965 --> 00:40:21,525
I need to think about who to call.

576
00:40:22,805 --> 00:40:23,765
I have a suggestion.

577
00:40:24,125 --> 00:40:25,845
You can call
whoever is on your speed dial.

578
00:40:26,245 --> 00:40:28,005
Or the last person
you chatted with on WeChat.

579
00:40:29,005 --> 00:40:32,805
<i>I wouldn't dare expose</i>
<i>my relationship with Ling Yizhou...</i>

580
00:40:33,325 --> 00:40:35,325
Can't you think of someone
at the agency to call?

581
00:40:39,805 --> 00:40:41,885
LING YIZHOU CALLING

582
00:40:44,325 --> 00:40:46,765
<i>You can't be serious.</i>

583
00:40:47,925 --> 00:40:50,045
Regardless of whether
it's a man or woman calling,

584
00:40:50,125 --> 00:40:53,005
as long as you complete your task,
we'll let you pass.

585
00:40:53,085 --> 00:40:54,365
Is it inconvenient for you?

586
00:43:43,445 --> 00:43:45,205
Subtitle translation by Alice Hsing

587
00:43:45,285 --> 00:43:47,085
So, the real reason
<i>Frosty Moon</i> was cancelled

588
00:43:47,165 --> 00:43:48,365
and Lu Yi was blacklisted

589
00:43:49,085 --> 00:43:50,045
is all because of you?

590
00:43:50,725 --> 00:43:51,645
He was blacklisted?

591
00:43:52,365 --> 00:43:53,605
I didn't know about that.

592
00:43:54,005 --> 00:43:56,325
He hit on my woman.
Of course he had to pay.

593
00:43:57,085 --> 00:44:00,085
Besides this, is there anything else
you're hiding from me?

594
00:44:00,925 --> 00:44:01,765
Nope.

595
00:44:02,685 --> 00:44:04,645
If reporters get a photo of us,

596
00:44:04,725 --> 00:44:06,525
we're going to be
in the gossip column again.

597
00:44:06,925 --> 00:44:08,005
I saw Chu Yan

598
00:44:08,645 --> 00:44:09,885
and your girlfriend

599
00:44:10,405 --> 00:44:11,645
walk into a hotel room.
