1
00:00:13,605 --> 00:00:14,485
What are you doing?

2
00:00:14,565 --> 00:00:15,965
This is necessary for our act.

3
00:00:16,685 --> 00:00:18,045
Grandma would be suspicious.

4
00:00:18,445 --> 00:00:19,605
Ms. Shuangshuang.

5
00:00:19,685 --> 00:00:23,125
I heard you know
Director Ling's housekeeper.

6
00:00:26,525 --> 00:00:28,605
I'm going to shower.
Would you like to join me?

7
00:00:34,365 --> 00:00:38,085
Did he just flirt with me?

8
00:00:38,165 --> 00:00:39,485
I can keep our marriage secret.

9
00:00:39,565 --> 00:00:41,565
-Really?
-But I have one condition.

10
00:00:42,885 --> 00:00:46,565
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

11
00:02:13,525 --> 00:02:16,485
EPISODE 5

12
00:02:33,485 --> 00:02:36,565
I shouldn't have agreed
so quickly yesterday.

13
00:02:39,045 --> 00:02:40,325
Any news about me?

14
00:02:46,525 --> 00:02:48,725
CHU YAN AND YIN SHUANGSHUANG
AT GANGDONG FILM FESTIVAL

15
00:02:50,965 --> 00:02:54,605
At least I didn't fall on the red carpet.
That would be embarrassing.

16
00:02:56,765 --> 00:02:59,685
I just blew away
my first red carpet experience.

17
00:03:00,165 --> 00:03:02,005
Why do I have terrible luck?

18
00:03:19,125 --> 00:03:22,285
I won't allow it.
I must be more careful next time.

19
00:03:22,805 --> 00:03:25,205
I must be as careful as possible.
Super careful.

20
00:03:25,805 --> 00:03:28,965
I must focus. Watch out for backstabbers.

21
00:03:35,245 --> 00:03:38,405
-Hey. You can't just come in here.
-Come down for breakfast.

22
00:03:48,725 --> 00:03:49,885
You should be more careful.

23
00:03:49,965 --> 00:03:51,405
You know you have an ankle injury.

24
00:03:51,685 --> 00:03:54,765
It doesn't hurt as much.
You rushed me, so I lost my balance.

25
00:03:57,325 --> 00:03:58,765
I'll interpret it as

26
00:03:59,365 --> 00:04:01,285
you fell because
you were nervous to see me.

27
00:04:01,965 --> 00:04:04,245
What are you talking about?
Are you sure you're awake?

28
00:04:05,125 --> 00:04:06,405
I'm going to get washed.

29
00:04:15,885 --> 00:04:17,725
LING YIZHOU COULD BE
DATING YIN SHUANGSHUANG

30
00:04:23,005 --> 00:04:24,925
<i>No wonder she's the star of the agency.</i>

31
00:04:25,005 --> 00:04:27,845
<i>She can hold up a play all by herself.</i>

32
00:04:32,565 --> 00:04:33,925
Focus on eating.

33
00:04:35,165 --> 00:04:36,725
Don't you usually use your phone, too?

34
00:04:37,805 --> 00:04:39,925
Why aren't you reading the news today?

35
00:04:40,285 --> 00:04:41,925
No phones while eating from now on.

36
00:04:46,045 --> 00:04:48,685
Are you sure you don't want
to look at your phone?

37
00:04:55,525 --> 00:04:58,685
<i>Mr. Ling, there's gossip about you</i>
<i>and Miss Yin all over the internet now.</i>

38
00:04:58,765 --> 00:05:01,445
<i>It's been shared too many times.</i>
<i>PR needs more time to deal with it.</i>

39
00:05:01,525 --> 00:05:03,285
Do I hire them for charity?

40
00:05:06,405 --> 00:05:08,405
Get rid of the news at once.

41
00:05:08,725 --> 00:05:10,645
<i>Also, notify Yin Shuangshuang on my behalf</i>

42
00:05:10,725 --> 00:05:12,925
<i>that we can get a new spokesperson</i>
<i>whenever we want.</i>

43
00:05:13,005 --> 00:05:13,845
You got it.

44
00:05:22,125 --> 00:05:23,525
YIN LIKED THE GOSSIP ARTICLE

45
00:05:23,605 --> 00:05:25,005
YIN REMOVED HER LIKE

46
00:05:26,525 --> 00:05:28,805
Were you reading gossip
about me and Yin Shuangshuang?

47
00:05:29,125 --> 00:05:31,125
It's the hottest topic today.
I can't avoid it.

48
00:05:31,685 --> 00:05:33,245
This is a tricky issue, isn't it?

49
00:05:33,765 --> 00:05:37,765
But I can give you some advice
to deal with the gossip.

50
00:05:38,245 --> 00:05:39,085
Why?

51
00:05:39,725 --> 00:05:42,205
You don't like seeing gossip
about me and another woman?

52
00:05:43,325 --> 00:05:44,485
You think too much.

53
00:05:44,565 --> 00:05:48,325
It's just to thank you
for helping me with my dress incident.

54
00:05:49,285 --> 00:05:50,205
Thank you, then.

55
00:05:50,725 --> 00:05:51,565
You're welcome.

56
00:05:59,965 --> 00:06:01,885
-This is your advice?
-Yes.

57
00:06:01,965 --> 00:06:04,325
Nowadays, many celebrities
defend themselves.

58
00:06:04,605 --> 00:06:06,765
As for you,
even though you don't have fans,

59
00:06:07,245 --> 00:06:09,085
based on your low public profile,

60
00:06:09,165 --> 00:06:10,885
if you make an official statement,

61
00:06:11,165 --> 00:06:14,485
these rumors would die down immediately.

62
00:06:15,885 --> 00:06:17,125
"Wooden Horse in the Sky"?

63
00:06:17,565 --> 00:06:19,605
It should be called
"Mumu's Imaginary World."

64
00:06:19,685 --> 00:06:21,925
-Stop looking. Log in yourself.
-I don't have an account.

65
00:06:25,165 --> 00:06:27,685
You're a public figure, aren't you?

66
00:06:28,045 --> 00:06:29,445
You don't use Weibo?

67
00:06:29,525 --> 00:06:31,645
I don't like people
following my personal life.

68
00:06:33,165 --> 00:06:37,085
Director Ling, you work all the time.

69
00:06:37,525 --> 00:06:39,205
Don't you find your life boring?

70
00:06:40,045 --> 00:06:40,885
Not really.

71
00:06:41,525 --> 00:06:46,045
Ever since we met,
my life has gotten a bit more interesting.

72
00:06:48,845 --> 00:06:51,765
You can read the latest news on Weibo.

73
00:06:51,845 --> 00:06:53,645
You can interact with interesting people.

74
00:06:54,205 --> 00:06:56,485
Are you implying
that we don't interact enough?

75
00:06:56,845 --> 00:06:58,445
Why do you need to interact with others?

76
00:06:58,845 --> 00:07:00,645
That was just an example.

77
00:07:00,725 --> 00:07:02,525
I don't plan on cheating.

78
00:07:02,605 --> 00:07:06,165
Also, even if I wanted to,
I couldn't afford the default penalty.

79
00:07:06,245 --> 00:07:07,125
Good.

80
00:07:17,085 --> 00:07:19,565
Help me verify
the account I just sent you.

81
00:07:20,805 --> 00:07:22,565
"Earn Money to Support Mumu"?

82
00:07:23,365 --> 00:07:24,525
Are you kidding? Change it.

83
00:07:25,085 --> 00:07:26,325
It's the truth though.

84
00:07:26,405 --> 00:07:29,005
Plus, I prefer this kind of username
to avoid harassment.

85
00:07:29,565 --> 00:07:31,845
It works for you, but I become the target.

86
00:07:31,925 --> 00:07:32,765
You're overreacting.

87
00:07:33,205 --> 00:07:35,005
Not many people know
you're called Xia Lin.

88
00:07:35,085 --> 00:07:37,165
Even fewer people know
that I call you Mumu.

89
00:07:37,245 --> 00:07:40,685
I'm an actress with 2,521 followers.

90
00:07:41,165 --> 00:07:42,005
That's great.

91
00:07:42,365 --> 00:07:46,245
Could I please ask this actress
with 2,521 followers

92
00:07:46,925 --> 00:07:48,365
to manage my account for me?

93
00:07:50,245 --> 00:07:51,325
What's the password?

94
00:07:52,165 --> 00:07:53,285
Your birthday.

95
00:07:55,165 --> 00:07:56,925
Isn't it also your birthday?

96
00:08:02,485 --> 00:08:04,125
What should I post?

97
00:08:05,765 --> 00:08:07,965
It shouldn't come off too strong,

98
00:08:08,605 --> 00:08:10,245
but it can't be too soft either.

99
00:08:11,965 --> 00:08:12,805
I know.

100
00:08:16,125 --> 00:08:17,645
LING CORPORATION

101
00:08:25,685 --> 00:08:26,765
Hey, check this out.

102
00:08:27,805 --> 00:08:29,805
I can't believe Mr. Ling
made a Weibo account.

103
00:08:30,845 --> 00:08:32,165
He did?

104
00:08:32,805 --> 00:08:34,805
Mumu? Who's Mumu?

105
00:08:35,405 --> 00:08:38,164
His ranking on
Weibo Hot Search is soaring.

106
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:40,164
But the topic is unexpectedly...

107
00:08:40,405 --> 00:08:41,445
"Cute husband"?

108
00:08:41,525 --> 00:08:43,205
Everyone, put your work to one side.

109
00:08:43,525 --> 00:08:45,285
We must restore
Director Ling's public image.

110
00:08:45,564 --> 00:08:48,005
Verify if it's a real account.

111
00:08:48,085 --> 00:08:49,885
-OK.
-Contact the media.

112
00:08:49,965 --> 00:08:51,005
No more relevant articles.

113
00:08:51,845 --> 00:08:54,125
-Monitor online comments closely.
-No problem.

114
00:08:54,205 --> 00:08:55,045
Let's get moving.

115
00:08:55,445 --> 00:08:56,765
-OK.
<i>-People in the group chat,</i>

116
00:08:56,845 --> 00:08:58,605
<i>why is Mr. Ling</i>
<i>acting differently on Weibo?</i>

117
00:08:58,685 --> 00:08:59,605
<i>The weather fluctuates.</i>

118
00:08:59,685 --> 00:09:01,325
<i>-The sun will be back.</i>
<i>-He's unpredictable.</i>

119
00:09:01,405 --> 00:09:03,885
<i>-It's indescribable.</i>
<i>-Is this the calm before the storm?</i>

120
00:09:03,965 --> 00:09:06,805
<i>I'm at the office door now. Going in.</i>

121
00:09:08,485 --> 00:09:10,645
Where did you come from?
You're so adorable.

122
00:09:11,605 --> 00:09:12,925
Why are you sitting here alone?

123
00:09:14,085 --> 00:09:15,245
Where's your owner?

124
00:09:17,605 --> 00:09:19,805
I don't have anything planned today,

125
00:09:20,565 --> 00:09:22,085
I'll keep you company for a while.

126
00:09:28,285 --> 00:09:31,285
"Earn Money to Support Mumu"
has 20,000 followers now?

127
00:09:31,965 --> 00:09:34,365
Why is he gaining followers
faster than celebrities?

128
00:09:36,085 --> 00:09:36,925
Tell me,

129
00:09:37,365 --> 00:09:39,285
when will I get so many followers?

130
00:09:44,445 --> 00:09:45,405
Let's take a selfie.

131
00:10:15,725 --> 00:10:18,605
Cutie, this will be
your temporary home for now.

132
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:20,365
Ma'am,

133
00:10:20,685 --> 00:10:22,525
why did you bring a dog home?

134
00:10:22,605 --> 00:10:23,645
I think it's lost.

135
00:10:23,725 --> 00:10:25,925
I didn't want anything bad to happen,
so I brought him.

136
00:10:26,005 --> 00:10:28,205
But Mr. Ling doesn't allow pets at home.

137
00:10:28,685 --> 00:10:30,085
Why? Is he afraid of dogs?

138
00:10:30,725 --> 00:10:34,045
No. Mr. Ling had a dog
when he was a child.

139
00:10:34,125 --> 00:10:37,525
But they got rid of it later
because Mr. Chu has asthma.

140
00:10:37,605 --> 00:10:39,885
I see. What should I do then?

141
00:10:40,645 --> 00:10:43,685
Property management told me
it will take some time to find its owner.

142
00:10:43,965 --> 00:10:44,885
How about this?

143
00:10:45,405 --> 00:10:47,325
You should discuss it with Mr. Ling.

144
00:10:47,405 --> 00:10:49,045
Maybe he'll agree to it.

145
00:10:49,285 --> 00:10:50,405
Discuss it with him?

146
00:10:51,525 --> 00:10:53,285
<i>You didn't consult me before you did that.</i>

147
00:10:53,365 --> 00:10:54,405
Is there a need?

148
00:10:55,165 --> 00:10:56,045
Never mind.

149
00:10:56,405 --> 00:10:57,765
Let me hide it first.

150
00:10:57,845 --> 00:10:58,965
We'll see what happens.

151
00:11:00,085 --> 00:11:00,925
Come on.

152
00:11:21,005 --> 00:11:23,925
You're home. You've worked so hard.
Let me help you with your jacket.

153
00:11:25,525 --> 00:11:28,325
I had Ms. Huang make your favorite dishes.

154
00:11:29,285 --> 00:11:30,605
Go wash your hands for dinner.

155
00:11:34,725 --> 00:11:35,925
Did you do something wrong?

156
00:11:37,205 --> 00:11:38,045
No.

157
00:11:38,765 --> 00:11:41,485
I just want to discuss something with you.

158
00:11:42,125 --> 00:11:45,245
I want to bring a dog home.
Just for a few days.

159
00:11:47,685 --> 00:11:49,725
That's why you're being
so nice to me today?

160
00:11:52,205 --> 00:11:53,045
No way.

161
00:12:15,125 --> 00:12:17,205
Where did this dog come from?

162
00:12:17,965 --> 00:12:18,925
Get off my bed.

163
00:12:19,605 --> 00:12:20,445
Out.

164
00:12:22,245 --> 00:12:23,885
You even peed on my bed?

165
00:12:23,965 --> 00:12:25,285
Get down right now.

166
00:12:25,365 --> 00:12:26,845
Get off my bed, do you hear me?

167
00:12:27,885 --> 00:12:31,605
I don't care where you came from.
Get off my bed immediately!

168
00:12:32,445 --> 00:12:33,285
Now!

169
00:12:37,245 --> 00:12:39,445
Ling Yizhou, are you awake?

170
00:12:48,405 --> 00:12:51,245
Your dog peed on my bed.
You never listen to me.

171
00:12:51,565 --> 00:12:53,765
I brought it back before you came home.

172
00:12:54,045 --> 00:12:55,405
Can I keep it for a few days?

173
00:12:55,485 --> 00:12:57,845
I thought I made myself clear.
No pets in the house.

174
00:12:58,205 --> 00:12:59,965
-Why not?
-No reason.

175
00:13:00,045 --> 00:13:02,125
You just can't because I said no.

176
00:13:02,205 --> 00:13:05,125
Please, once I find its owner,
I'll send it away at once.

177
00:13:05,205 --> 00:13:06,245
You won't do it?

178
00:13:06,645 --> 00:13:07,485
Huh?

179
00:13:08,285 --> 00:13:09,285
I'll have Wen Li do it.

180
00:13:09,965 --> 00:13:11,165
Why are you so cold-hearted?

181
00:13:12,605 --> 00:13:14,965
Fine. Call him.
Have him get rid of me as well.

182
00:13:15,485 --> 00:13:16,325
Let's go!

183
00:13:26,605 --> 00:13:28,205
Why did you go into his room?

184
00:13:28,685 --> 00:13:31,245
And why did you have to pee on his bed?

185
00:13:32,005 --> 00:13:32,885
Don't worry.

186
00:13:33,285 --> 00:13:35,845
I won't let him send you away.

187
00:13:42,685 --> 00:13:43,525
Hello?

188
00:13:43,765 --> 00:13:46,645
Hi, property management
told me you found a Samoyed.

189
00:13:47,285 --> 00:13:48,125
I'm his owner.

190
00:13:48,685 --> 00:13:50,165
They finally found you.

191
00:13:50,245 --> 00:13:53,005
I brought him home with me
because I was worried about his safety.

192
00:13:53,445 --> 00:13:54,405
Thank you so much.

193
00:13:54,765 --> 00:13:57,365
He ran away from the pet center.
I was so worried.

194
00:13:58,005 --> 00:14:01,245
<i>Don't worry. He's safe with me.</i>
<i>When will you pick him up?</i>

195
00:14:03,485 --> 00:14:04,845
I'm traveling right now.

196
00:14:04,925 --> 00:14:07,965
It will be a few days before I go back.
By the way, his name is Eleven.

197
00:14:08,845 --> 00:14:12,245
Should I take Eleven back
to the pet center?

198
00:14:14,725 --> 00:14:16,045
I hate to trouble you,

199
00:14:16,125 --> 00:14:18,805
but Eleven doesn't like the pet store.

200
00:14:19,565 --> 00:14:21,405
Could you look after him for a few days?

201
00:14:24,725 --> 00:14:26,365
Sure, no problem.

202
00:14:27,245 --> 00:14:29,285
Sorry about that. What's your name?

203
00:14:30,285 --> 00:14:31,125
My name is Xia Lin.

204
00:14:32,965 --> 00:14:35,245
Ms. Xia, I'll be back as soon as possible.

205
00:14:35,965 --> 00:14:36,805
<i>OK.</i>

206
00:14:42,805 --> 00:14:44,805
So, your name is Eleven.

207
00:14:46,965 --> 00:14:50,005
We'll be hanging out for a few days.

208
00:15:01,245 --> 00:15:03,965
Sir, we've acquired
all five small companies.

209
00:15:07,085 --> 00:15:07,925
And the employees?

210
00:15:08,005 --> 00:15:11,845
Through headhunters, we've poached
13 key staff members from Lingshi.

211
00:15:11,925 --> 00:15:13,765
We're reaching out
to a few more right now.

212
00:15:17,085 --> 00:15:18,565
Any movements from them lately?

213
00:15:19,245 --> 00:15:23,005
Recently, Lingshi Group injected
$50 million in product development.

214
00:15:23,725 --> 00:15:25,885
They'll be launching
a few new products soon.

215
00:15:27,525 --> 00:15:28,365
Keep an eye on them.

216
00:15:28,725 --> 00:15:29,565
Yes, sir.

217
00:15:33,685 --> 00:15:34,685
Fifty million...

218
00:15:55,205 --> 00:15:57,525
Eleven isn't here. You can have the steak.

219
00:16:08,365 --> 00:16:10,405
-Why are you in such a hurry?
-Lower your voice.

220
00:16:12,365 --> 00:16:13,565
Heading out, Director Ling?

221
00:16:16,165 --> 00:16:18,605
-What's going on between you two?
-Let's talk inside.

222
00:16:21,165 --> 00:16:24,245
You're not talking because of a dog?
That's so childish!

223
00:16:25,045 --> 00:16:27,525
I have to share this news with my buddies.

224
00:16:27,605 --> 00:16:29,725
Mr. Ling doesn't allow pets.

225
00:16:30,965 --> 00:16:34,885
I asked you to come help me,
not laugh at me.

226
00:16:34,965 --> 00:16:37,325
Don't worry. I'll help you.
Any other breaking news for me?

227
00:16:37,805 --> 00:16:40,165
Breaking news? Let me think.

228
00:16:40,685 --> 00:16:43,405
Rumor has it that he doesn't like to talk.

229
00:16:43,805 --> 00:16:46,205
The truth is, he doesn't
have time for nonsense.

230
00:16:46,405 --> 00:16:47,685
Some say he's not into women.

231
00:16:48,805 --> 00:16:50,765
I wish he was less flirty.

232
00:16:53,005 --> 00:16:54,525
Are you falling for him?

233
00:16:55,445 --> 00:16:58,845
Me? That's impossible.

234
00:17:00,245 --> 00:17:01,245
Xia Lin.

235
00:17:01,685 --> 00:17:05,405
I know men like Ling Yizhou
seem almost irresistible,

236
00:17:05,485 --> 00:17:07,005
but you have to stay strong.

237
00:17:15,084 --> 00:17:16,405
Miss An?

238
00:17:16,725 --> 00:17:19,604
<i>Linlin, I heard you fell yesterday.</i>
<i>Are you OK?</i>

239
00:17:19,844 --> 00:17:20,844
I'm fine.

240
00:17:20,925 --> 00:17:23,525
Those shoes were so expensive.
How could they be low-quality?

241
00:17:24,005 --> 00:17:25,765
I'm definitely going to file a complaint.

242
00:17:26,084 --> 00:17:28,765
I happen to be a VIP there.

243
00:17:28,844 --> 00:17:32,245
I'll have them send you another pair, OK?

244
00:17:32,725 --> 00:17:35,125
That works. Thank you.

245
00:17:35,445 --> 00:17:36,405
<i>No problem.</i>

246
00:17:36,485 --> 00:17:39,605
Actually, I called to ask you to a movie.

247
00:17:39,685 --> 00:17:40,805
Are you free this afternoon?

248
00:17:40,885 --> 00:17:41,925
Yeah.

249
00:17:42,725 --> 00:17:44,325
Can I...

250
00:17:44,405 --> 00:17:46,085
bring my friend along?

251
00:17:46,405 --> 00:17:49,205
Of course. I'll send you the address.

252
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:50,325
Great.

253
00:17:52,845 --> 00:17:55,805
Is she one of your two love rivals?

254
00:17:55,885 --> 00:17:58,365
She's had a crush on Ling Yizhou
ever since she was a girl.

255
00:17:58,925 --> 00:18:01,645
But I ruined her plan somehow.

256
00:18:01,725 --> 00:18:04,445
Why go out with her alone?
Aren't you afraid of being backstabbed?

257
00:18:04,925 --> 00:18:08,045
There's nothing wrong with liking someone.
Plus, she hasn't done anything.

258
00:18:08,125 --> 00:18:10,645
It would be petty to keep my guard up.

259
00:18:13,045 --> 00:18:15,005
Said like a real queen.

260
00:18:16,405 --> 00:18:18,405
Wait a minute,
I have to get keys from Ms. Huang.

261
00:18:18,885 --> 00:18:20,805
-What for?
-To lock up the doors.

262
00:18:21,125 --> 00:18:23,685
What if Ling Yizhou sends my dog away
when I'm not here?

263
00:18:28,485 --> 00:18:32,565
<i>Chu Yan, I'm not feeling well.</i>
<i>I won't be able to make it to the movie.</i>

264
00:18:34,565 --> 00:18:36,405
You're not feeling well?
I'm the patient here.

265
00:18:37,045 --> 00:18:38,285
How could you do this to me?

266
00:18:39,325 --> 00:18:40,245
Right here.

267
00:18:48,645 --> 00:18:49,765
Why are you here?

268
00:18:50,605 --> 00:18:51,765
Same reason you're here.

269
00:18:54,645 --> 00:18:56,645
This is my best friend, Jia Fei.

270
00:18:57,125 --> 00:18:58,965
-This is...
-Mr. Chu.

271
00:18:59,045 --> 00:19:01,325
I'm one of your ten million fans.

272
00:19:01,405 --> 00:19:02,765
Could I take a picture with you?

273
00:19:04,165 --> 00:19:05,085
Sure.

274
00:19:06,765 --> 00:19:08,165
Scoot over. Hurry up.

275
00:19:25,165 --> 00:19:26,085
Take a look.

276
00:19:32,725 --> 00:19:35,285
Why isn't Miss An here?

277
00:19:36,605 --> 00:19:38,525
She wasn't feeling well.

278
00:19:42,525 --> 00:19:45,125
If I didn't tag along,

279
00:19:46,045 --> 00:19:47,645
it would be just you and Mr. Chu alone.

280
00:19:49,365 --> 00:19:51,965
Thank God you're here.
Or else he would be picking on me.

281
00:19:53,685 --> 00:19:54,765
Can you get any louder?

282
00:19:54,845 --> 00:19:55,845
Am I wrong?

283
00:19:56,165 --> 00:19:57,005
You...

284
00:20:01,205 --> 00:20:03,285
-You pissed him off.
-He deserved it.

285
00:20:08,085 --> 00:20:09,245
He left his phone behind.

286
00:20:09,685 --> 00:20:11,725
Just leave it. He'll be back soon.

287
00:20:13,325 --> 00:20:14,405
I'm giving you a chance.

288
00:20:16,405 --> 00:20:18,445
So annoying. Hold this.

289
00:20:30,845 --> 00:20:31,685
Here you go.

290
00:20:41,565 --> 00:20:42,405
Are you OK?

291
00:20:43,725 --> 00:20:44,565
I'm fine.

292
00:20:51,165 --> 00:20:52,005
Have you guys heard?

293
00:20:52,365 --> 00:20:54,045
Chu Yan is here today. He's inside.

294
00:20:54,485 --> 00:20:55,645
-Really?
-Let's go in now.

295
00:20:55,725 --> 00:20:58,325
-Take a selfie with him.
-Let's go in, hurry!

296
00:21:03,165 --> 00:21:05,125
Mr. Ling had a dog when he was a child.

297
00:21:05,285 --> 00:21:08,765
But they got rid of it later
because Mr. Chu has asthma.

298
00:21:08,845 --> 00:21:09,925
Where's your inhaler?

299
00:21:10,445 --> 00:21:12,685
I lost it when I was buying water.

300
00:21:13,085 --> 00:21:14,565
Wait here, I'll go look for it.

301
00:21:15,085 --> 00:21:18,085
No. My fans are over there.

302
00:21:20,125 --> 00:21:22,645
What should I do then?
Let me take you to the hospital.

303
00:21:23,365 --> 00:21:24,205
No, don't.

304
00:21:29,525 --> 00:21:31,045
-Let's go.
-Do you want some popcorn?

305
00:21:31,125 --> 00:21:32,685
Where are we going? What are you doing?

306
00:21:32,765 --> 00:21:34,085
Sure. Let's get the combo.

307
00:21:35,045 --> 00:21:36,245
Rest here.

308
00:21:36,685 --> 00:21:38,565
Your fans won't come here.

309
00:21:39,365 --> 00:21:40,645
How do you feel right now?

310
00:21:46,525 --> 00:21:49,085
-Hello?
-Linlin, where are you guys?

311
00:21:49,605 --> 00:21:52,325
Chu Yan's fans are everywhere.
We're trapped inside the storage room.

312
00:21:52,925 --> 00:21:54,565
Wait there. I'll think of something.

313
00:22:04,525 --> 00:22:06,205
I'll go get your inhaler.

314
00:22:07,245 --> 00:22:08,525
Hang in there. Wait for me.

315
00:22:09,485 --> 00:22:10,485
OK.

316
00:22:20,165 --> 00:22:22,045
WHO'S THE GIRL WITH CHU YAN
AT THE MOVIES?

317
00:22:26,165 --> 00:22:27,005
An Ran?

318
00:22:28,005 --> 00:22:28,965
Yizhou.

319
00:22:29,445 --> 00:22:32,365
I brought you your favorite coffee,
but it's cold now.

320
00:22:33,565 --> 00:22:34,605
The meeting just ended.

321
00:22:35,165 --> 00:22:36,245
Why are you here?

322
00:22:36,765 --> 00:22:39,285
I wasn't feeling well,
so I went to the hospital.

323
00:22:39,365 --> 00:22:40,845
Just dropping by to say hi.

324
00:22:41,725 --> 00:22:44,485
If you're not feeling well,
you should go home and rest.

325
00:22:47,565 --> 00:22:49,885
You promised to welcome me home
with a dinner party.

326
00:22:49,965 --> 00:22:51,685
You haven't fulfilled your promise yet.

327
00:22:52,965 --> 00:22:54,805
I don't have time today. I'm very busy.

328
00:22:56,285 --> 00:22:58,485
What about tomorrow?

329
00:22:58,565 --> 00:22:59,885
I'll be busy tomorrow, too.

330
00:23:01,125 --> 00:23:01,965
Doing what?

331
00:23:03,005 --> 00:23:03,925
It's Mumu's birthday.

332
00:23:07,765 --> 00:23:10,245
Mr. Ling, Mrs. Ling and Mr. Chu
are trapped in the theater.

333
00:23:11,605 --> 00:23:12,885
Why are they together?

334
00:23:13,525 --> 00:23:17,405
I thought there was a misunderstanding
between Chu Yan and Linlin,

335
00:23:17,485 --> 00:23:20,605
so I set up a chance
for them to talk it out.

336
00:23:20,925 --> 00:23:23,045
Who would know my good intentions
would go wrong?

337
00:23:25,885 --> 00:23:28,845
Also, people are posting
pictures on Weibo.

338
00:23:31,645 --> 00:23:33,885
Take the pictures down.
Don't let any of them spread.

339
00:23:34,285 --> 00:23:35,645
-Yes, sir.
-I'll go look for them.

340
00:23:42,685 --> 00:23:44,445
You don't look good in this.

341
00:23:45,245 --> 00:23:46,965
See? That's what everyone says.

342
00:23:47,685 --> 00:23:48,885
Why not?

343
00:23:49,405 --> 00:23:50,325
Let me tell you why.

344
00:23:51,445 --> 00:23:52,725
Excuse me, I'm sorry.

345
00:23:52,805 --> 00:23:53,765
-Sorry.
-Are you OK?

346
00:23:53,845 --> 00:23:54,845
I'm fine.

347
00:23:55,125 --> 00:23:56,365
You just stepped on someone.

348
00:23:58,765 --> 00:23:59,765
Look, I found it.

349
00:24:00,245 --> 00:24:01,085
Hurry.

350
00:24:07,445 --> 00:24:09,045
How is it? Better now?

351
00:24:13,205 --> 00:24:14,325
Are you feeling better

352
00:24:19,925 --> 00:24:21,085
What happened to your hand?

353
00:24:23,085 --> 00:24:24,445
It's no big deal.

354
00:24:24,525 --> 00:24:27,605
I got accidentally stepped on
when I was looking for the inhaler.

355
00:24:27,685 --> 00:24:29,605
Fei will find us in no time.

356
00:24:37,965 --> 00:24:39,965
In a situation like this,
it's better to call Ling.

357
00:24:40,565 --> 00:24:42,045
Why don't you call your manager?

358
00:24:43,605 --> 00:24:44,485
I prefer Ling.

359
00:24:46,165 --> 00:24:48,605
Then I'll go chat with your fans.

360
00:24:50,885 --> 00:24:52,525
Fine. I lose.

361
00:24:53,045 --> 00:24:54,005
You win.

362
00:24:55,565 --> 00:24:58,645
Since you helped me out today,
what can I do for you?

363
00:25:00,525 --> 00:25:02,805
If you're thankful, just say thank you.

364
00:25:03,245 --> 00:25:04,885
If you feel sorry, just say sorry.

365
00:25:05,165 --> 00:25:08,285
Communication is that simple. Get it?

366
00:25:12,045 --> 00:25:12,925
I'm sorry.

367
00:25:18,005 --> 00:25:19,725
I just don't like to owe anyone anything.

368
00:25:21,805 --> 00:25:23,805
You're so paranoid.

369
00:25:27,245 --> 00:25:29,765
You'll agree to anything?

370
00:25:32,045 --> 00:25:34,725
If it's related to drama, then yes.

371
00:25:34,805 --> 00:25:38,485
Well... my friend asked me
to watch his dog for two days.

372
00:25:39,165 --> 00:25:41,485
Can you help me persuade Ling Yizhou?

373
00:25:44,365 --> 00:25:45,245
That's it?

374
00:25:46,045 --> 00:25:47,365
Mm-hmm. What else would it be?

375
00:25:47,765 --> 00:25:49,845
Don't you want me to give you a role?

376
00:25:49,925 --> 00:25:51,605
Or put you in another production?

377
00:25:52,885 --> 00:25:55,725
If you do it because you like my acting,

378
00:25:55,805 --> 00:25:58,285
then of course I will accept it,
but that's not the case.

379
00:25:59,285 --> 00:26:00,405
So,

380
00:26:01,005 --> 00:26:04,125
will you help me persuade Ling Yizhou?

381
00:26:06,925 --> 00:26:08,325
Say something.

382
00:26:10,685 --> 00:26:13,045
I can help with anything but this.

383
00:26:13,445 --> 00:26:14,525
Why?

384
00:26:15,085 --> 00:26:16,845
Didn't they send his dog away
because of you?

385
00:26:23,485 --> 00:26:24,325
Fine.

386
00:26:26,365 --> 00:26:28,685
I'll tell you why. Then we're even.

387
00:26:35,485 --> 00:26:36,365
Deal.

388
00:26:56,205 --> 00:26:59,245
<i>A businessman cannot have emotions.</i>
<i>You'll understand when you grow up.</i>

389
00:27:05,125 --> 00:27:07,845
Other people think it's because of me,
but it's actually not.

390
00:27:08,685 --> 00:27:09,605
It was his dad.

391
00:27:10,685 --> 00:27:13,605
Since then, Ling hasn't had any pets.

392
00:27:15,045 --> 00:27:17,165
No, to be more specific,

393
00:27:17,885 --> 00:27:20,605
he hasn't had feelings
for anything or anyone.

394
00:27:22,525 --> 00:27:24,645
Of course, I'm the only exception,

395
00:27:24,725 --> 00:27:25,885
because I'm his buddy.

396
00:27:27,445 --> 00:27:30,045
So what? Our marriage is protected by law.

397
00:27:30,605 --> 00:27:31,765
Do you have that?

398
00:27:32,885 --> 00:27:33,765
So what?

399
00:27:34,285 --> 00:27:35,685
Have you not heard of this?

400
00:27:36,325 --> 00:27:38,805
Brothers are like your hands and feet,
women are like clothing.

401
00:27:39,285 --> 00:27:40,525
How dare you!

402
00:27:44,285 --> 00:27:45,525
Chu Yan. Mrs. Ling.

403
00:27:47,445 --> 00:27:48,365
Why are you here?

404
00:28:09,165 --> 00:28:10,005
Let's go.

405
00:28:15,925 --> 00:28:18,085
Alright. Have a seat.

406
00:28:20,245 --> 00:28:21,485
Oh, my God.

407
00:28:24,765 --> 00:28:26,685
I think we got away from them.

408
00:28:34,525 --> 00:28:36,245
It was you? Thanks.

409
00:28:37,085 --> 00:28:37,925
Who's here for you?

410
00:28:39,525 --> 00:28:40,685
I'm here to pick up Mumu.

411
00:28:44,845 --> 00:28:47,085
An Ran, are you feeling better now?

412
00:28:47,165 --> 00:28:49,685
I stopped by the hospital for a checkup.
I'm much better now.

413
00:28:49,765 --> 00:28:52,885
I'm really sorry. I didn't know it
would cause so much trouble.

414
00:28:52,965 --> 00:28:55,245
I'm fine. He's the victim here.

415
00:28:57,445 --> 00:28:58,285
Who's the victim?

416
00:28:58,845 --> 00:29:01,045
You're just jealous of my popularity.

417
00:29:01,125 --> 00:29:02,325
You...

418
00:29:02,765 --> 00:29:04,765
Let's go watch a movie.

419
00:29:07,725 --> 00:29:08,765
What about me?

420
00:29:09,405 --> 00:29:11,405
I'll take you home, Chu Yan.

421
00:29:12,925 --> 00:29:14,445
You're the best, little princess.

422
00:29:14,525 --> 00:29:17,045
Unlike some people. Bros before hoes, man.

423
00:29:17,365 --> 00:29:18,205
Let's go.

424
00:29:21,965 --> 00:29:24,405
Thank you for today.

425
00:29:25,245 --> 00:29:26,285
It's part of my job.

426
00:29:27,125 --> 00:29:28,405
Having said that,

427
00:29:28,885 --> 00:29:30,885
this is Director Ling's personal matter.

428
00:29:31,205 --> 00:29:33,525
It's best to separate business
and personal matters.

429
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:36,085
I'll do anything
as long as it's an order from my boss.

430
00:29:37,245 --> 00:29:40,445
<i>A loyal dog</i>
<i>that would give its all for love.</i>

431
00:29:43,805 --> 00:29:44,845
I'll give you a ride home.

432
00:29:46,525 --> 00:29:48,285
Not so fast. Wait for me.

433
00:29:52,365 --> 00:29:54,445
<i>How should I apologize?</i>

434
00:29:54,525 --> 00:29:58,365
<i>He probably doesn't want anyone to know</i>
<i>why he doesn't want a dog.</i>

435
00:30:04,365 --> 00:30:05,845
Sorry, I wasn't looking.

436
00:30:07,605 --> 00:30:08,965
It's not the first time.

437
00:30:11,685 --> 00:30:13,045
Thanks for helping Chu Yan out.

438
00:30:13,845 --> 00:30:15,485
But you two are both public figures.

439
00:30:15,765 --> 00:30:17,365
To avoid unnecessary trouble,

440
00:30:17,445 --> 00:30:20,125
it's better if you avoid
seeing each other alone.

441
00:30:20,645 --> 00:30:23,485
Of course. I want to stay as far away
as possible from him.

442
00:30:24,685 --> 00:30:27,405
Oh, no! Were there pictures taken today?

443
00:30:28,925 --> 00:30:29,965
I already took care of it.

444
00:30:32,765 --> 00:30:35,405
Sorry for causing you trouble again.

445
00:30:36,565 --> 00:30:39,245
I'm used to it. Don't stay up too late.

446
00:30:41,085 --> 00:30:44,885
About the dog... I'm sorry.

447
00:30:45,325 --> 00:30:48,885
I shouldn't have brought it home
without your permission.

448
00:30:50,445 --> 00:30:51,685
So you plan to send it away?

449
00:30:52,085 --> 00:30:55,165
Its owner will return in a few days.

450
00:30:55,685 --> 00:30:58,685
So, can we just keep it for a few days?

451
00:31:01,365 --> 00:31:04,125
Are you haggling with me?

452
00:31:04,645 --> 00:31:07,405
Please. Let me know
if I can do anything for you.

453
00:31:07,885 --> 00:31:09,085
There really is something.

454
00:31:09,725 --> 00:31:11,605
-And only you can do it.
-Tell me.

455
00:31:11,685 --> 00:31:12,925
Grandma wants a great-grandson.

456
00:31:17,205 --> 00:31:21,965
There's a contract between us.
We can't breach it.

457
00:31:23,245 --> 00:31:25,285
I thought you offered
to do something for me.

458
00:31:27,285 --> 00:31:31,445
Aren't you afraid I'll fall for you
and become clingy?

459
00:31:31,965 --> 00:31:35,405
It's fine. I won't fall for you.

460
00:31:39,605 --> 00:31:40,685
What are you doing?

461
00:31:43,565 --> 00:31:45,325
I'll stop teasing you.
Go back to your room.

462
00:31:46,205 --> 00:31:47,085
So you agree?

463
00:31:47,405 --> 00:31:49,085
Only this once.

464
00:31:49,885 --> 00:31:50,765
Thank you!

465
00:31:51,925 --> 00:31:55,245
Why are you OK with it now?

466
00:31:58,045 --> 00:31:59,205
Because compared to the dog...

467
00:32:01,125 --> 00:32:02,565
I care more about our relationship.

468
00:32:21,805 --> 00:32:24,725
Due to extensive word-of-mouth marketing
before the new product launch,

469
00:32:24,805 --> 00:32:27,805
all feedback has been
very positive so far.

470
00:32:27,885 --> 00:32:30,765
The only existing problem is
failure to keep up with product demand.

471
00:32:32,325 --> 00:32:34,565
The production department
is boosting output,

472
00:32:34,645 --> 00:32:36,205
hoping to catch up with demand.

473
00:32:37,245 --> 00:32:38,125
Come here.

474
00:32:38,205 --> 00:32:40,165
Ms. Huang and I made all this.

475
00:32:41,365 --> 00:32:42,205
What's the occasion?

476
00:32:42,685 --> 00:32:44,845
Did you forget? Today is our birthday.

477
00:32:45,405 --> 00:32:46,245
Happy birthday.

478
00:33:05,365 --> 00:33:08,685
Are you free tonight?
We could celebrate together.

479
00:33:09,205 --> 00:33:10,045
I'm very busy.

480
00:33:11,165 --> 00:33:12,765
Even on your birthday?

481
00:33:13,165 --> 00:33:15,125
There's been only
one exception in my life,

482
00:33:15,565 --> 00:33:16,525
marrying you.

483
00:33:18,205 --> 00:33:20,045
I'm not hungry. You can eat without me.

484
00:33:29,925 --> 00:33:33,445
LINGSHI GROUP CO. LTD.

485
00:33:56,405 --> 00:33:59,325
<i>Hello? The owner of this phone</i>
<i>is drunk at our restaurant.</i>

486
00:33:59,405 --> 00:34:01,005
<i>Could you come pick her up?</i>

487
00:34:01,925 --> 00:34:03,485
OK. Send me your address.

488
00:34:34,765 --> 00:34:37,204
Mrs. Ling, you should start eating.

489
00:34:38,005 --> 00:34:40,925
On his birthday,
Mr. Ling tends to come home late.

490
00:34:41,485 --> 00:34:42,925
It's fine.

491
00:34:43,005 --> 00:34:46,005
It's our birthday.
We should at least have a meal together.

492
00:34:47,445 --> 00:34:48,285
Alright then.

493
00:35:07,725 --> 00:35:09,925
AN RAN: ALL SET.
WAITING FOR YIZHOU TO SHOW UP!

494
00:35:13,405 --> 00:35:16,765
He didn't even tell me
he was celebrating with her.

495
00:35:16,845 --> 00:35:18,525
I've been waiting for so long.

496
00:35:21,245 --> 00:35:23,325
Well, he missed out
on these delicious dishes.

497
00:35:23,765 --> 00:35:24,885
That's his loss.

498
00:35:39,565 --> 00:35:41,685
Yizhou, you're finally here.

499
00:35:44,365 --> 00:35:46,645
-You're not drunk?
-Of course I'm not.

500
00:35:46,725 --> 00:35:48,325
I just wanted to give you a surprise.

501
00:35:48,845 --> 00:35:51,605
An Ran, don't prank me like this again.
I'm leaving.

502
00:35:52,485 --> 00:35:53,765
Yizhou,

503
00:35:53,845 --> 00:35:56,765
since you're already here,
stay and have dinner with me.

504
00:35:57,565 --> 00:35:59,805
An Ran, you know what today means to me.

505
00:36:01,085 --> 00:36:02,125
Mumu is waiting for me.

506
00:36:02,565 --> 00:36:03,765
It's always Mumu.

507
00:36:04,325 --> 00:36:06,125
How long have you even known each other?

508
00:36:06,205 --> 00:36:09,125
How come she gets to celebrate
your birthday with you, and I don't?

509
00:36:09,205 --> 00:36:10,205
She's my wife.

510
00:36:10,885 --> 00:36:11,765
You're like my sister.

511
00:36:12,805 --> 00:36:14,605
But I don't want to be your sister.

512
00:36:15,565 --> 00:36:17,725
Yizhou, you know how I feel about you.

513
00:36:18,285 --> 00:36:19,925
I've liked you since I was little.

514
00:36:23,605 --> 00:36:26,245
You're wrong.
An Ran, you don't actually like me.

515
00:36:27,365 --> 00:36:30,885
You simply want to have me,
just like those barbie dolls of yours.

516
00:36:31,245 --> 00:36:33,805
I only want you because I like you.

517
00:36:36,005 --> 00:36:37,805
An Ran, I'm married.

518
00:36:38,405 --> 00:36:40,125
I'll never betray my marriage.

519
00:36:41,085 --> 00:36:41,925
Do you understand?

520
00:36:44,125 --> 00:36:45,165
Ling Yizhou!

521
00:36:46,885 --> 00:36:48,765
If I hadn't gone abroad two years ago,

522
00:36:49,285 --> 00:36:53,005
I'd be married to you right now,
wouldn't I?

523
00:36:54,685 --> 00:36:55,605
An Ran.

524
00:36:56,645 --> 00:36:58,725
Some things in this world
are destined to be.

525
00:36:59,285 --> 00:37:02,325
No matter how many times you reset it,
the results will still be the same.

526
00:37:07,965 --> 00:37:08,925
You should go home.

527
00:37:30,045 --> 00:37:31,685
You can't trade your tears for love.

528
00:37:35,045 --> 00:37:35,965
You?

529
00:37:38,565 --> 00:37:39,605
I'm surprised that...

530
00:37:40,405 --> 00:37:42,285
after all these years,
you still remember me.

531
00:37:44,165 --> 00:37:45,245
What are you doing here?

532
00:37:46,245 --> 00:37:47,765
I'm here to help you.

533
00:38:10,085 --> 00:38:12,845
This is how you celebrate my birthday?

534
00:38:13,165 --> 00:38:14,405
I thought you were busy.

535
00:38:14,485 --> 00:38:16,085
I prepared all this for myself.

536
00:38:16,525 --> 00:38:18,365
Didn't you say you'd wait for me?

537
00:38:18,765 --> 00:38:20,605
You didn't reply. I can't wait forever.

538
00:38:21,725 --> 00:38:22,725
I'm not stupid.

539
00:38:23,845 --> 00:38:24,685
Are you mad?

540
00:38:25,925 --> 00:38:27,125
Mad?

541
00:38:27,645 --> 00:38:29,805
I couldn't be more happier
eating all this food.

542
00:38:31,645 --> 00:38:32,485
Come with me.

543
00:38:33,845 --> 00:38:35,245
-Let's go.
-What?

544
00:38:38,645 --> 00:38:40,885
What are you up to?

545
00:38:41,165 --> 00:38:42,005
Mumu.

546
00:38:43,285 --> 00:38:44,405
Happy Birthday.

547
00:38:47,085 --> 00:38:50,165
For me?

548
00:38:52,765 --> 00:38:53,845
Who else could it be for?

549
00:38:55,005 --> 00:38:58,205
Weren't you celebrating
your birthday with An Ran?

550
00:38:58,805 --> 00:39:00,365
I thought it was from her.

551
00:39:00,445 --> 00:39:02,285
I just went to meet her.

552
00:39:05,285 --> 00:39:07,205
Why? Are you jealous?

553
00:39:08,965 --> 00:39:09,805
Excuse me.

554
00:39:10,285 --> 00:39:14,325
I ate sweet and spicy food today,
but nothing sour.

555
00:39:16,085 --> 00:39:18,205
Here. Open it.

556
00:39:21,805 --> 00:39:23,325
What is it?

557
00:39:23,405 --> 00:39:24,685
Your birthday present.

558
00:39:35,925 --> 00:39:37,445
My gift is a building?

559
00:39:38,805 --> 00:39:40,005
No...

560
00:39:40,085 --> 00:39:41,925
This gift is too much. I can't accept it.

561
00:39:42,005 --> 00:39:42,845
Don't worry.

562
00:39:43,645 --> 00:39:45,245
It's only a formality.

563
00:39:46,005 --> 00:39:46,925
What do you mean?

564
00:39:50,485 --> 00:39:51,685
We're married.

565
00:39:52,285 --> 00:39:53,845
What's mine is also yours.

566
00:39:56,405 --> 00:39:58,085
So, Mrs. Ling...

567
00:39:59,245 --> 00:40:02,485
where's my present?

568
00:40:06,445 --> 00:40:08,885
I actually made you a cake.

569
00:40:09,645 --> 00:40:10,845
But I ate it all.

570
00:40:12,365 --> 00:40:15,085
I'll make you another one next time.

571
00:40:16,685 --> 00:40:17,885
No need for next time.

572
00:40:24,605 --> 00:40:27,005
I used to come to this bakery quite often.

573
00:40:27,645 --> 00:40:29,085
It hasn't changed a bit.

574
00:40:31,805 --> 00:40:34,205
Alright.

575
00:40:35,045 --> 00:40:36,925
Now is your chance to make it up to me.

576
00:40:38,005 --> 00:40:41,565
But it will take a long time.

577
00:40:46,365 --> 00:40:48,085
What are you doing?

578
00:40:48,885 --> 00:40:49,765
It's fine.

579
00:40:51,205 --> 00:40:52,205
I can help you.

580
00:45:24,405 --> 00:45:26,165
Subtitle translation by Alice Hsing

581
00:45:26,245 --> 00:45:28,445
In the whole world,
the animal that's best at desertion

582
00:45:29,165 --> 00:45:30,045
is mankind.

583
00:45:30,125 --> 00:45:32,765
They abandon their lovers, their family,

584
00:45:33,125 --> 00:45:34,685
and even their own children.

585
00:45:35,605 --> 00:45:36,565
Women...

586
00:45:38,325 --> 00:45:40,165
What do they like?

587
00:45:40,565 --> 00:45:42,605
I don't really have female friends, so...

588
00:45:43,085 --> 00:45:44,485
You seem to know Jia Fei well.

589
00:45:46,925 --> 00:45:49,365
Don't think you can do this
because you know about my secret.

590
00:45:49,725 --> 00:45:52,645
I just hate seeing you whine all the time.

591
00:45:52,725 --> 00:45:54,645
It's not like the entire world owes you.
