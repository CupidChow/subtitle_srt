1
00:00:13,365 --> 00:00:14,205
Dr. Wang,

2
00:00:15,125 --> 00:00:16,245
tell me the truth.

3
00:00:17,165 --> 00:00:18,565
Will he wake up?

4
00:00:18,645 --> 00:00:21,565
It's possible, but it would be a miracle.

5
00:00:21,645 --> 00:00:24,485
Lingshi's shareholders want the board

6
00:00:24,565 --> 00:00:26,285
to remove Ling Yizhou as CEO.

7
00:00:26,365 --> 00:00:27,565
Those bastards.

8
00:00:28,005 --> 00:00:29,845
They're already trying
to take over the company.

9
00:00:30,325 --> 00:00:31,525
You mean that

10
00:00:32,085 --> 00:00:34,285
someone wants to take over Lingshi

11
00:00:35,085 --> 00:00:36,405
while Ling Yizhou is unconscious?

12
00:00:36,885 --> 00:00:40,885
I can't let Yizhou
and his father's hard work be stolen.

13
00:00:41,245 --> 00:00:45,005
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

14
00:02:11,885 --> 00:02:14,845
EPISODE 20

15
00:02:24,845 --> 00:02:26,165
You're not going to introduce us?

16
00:02:27,885 --> 00:02:28,725
Oh...

17
00:02:32,125 --> 00:02:34,565
Tong Xiaoyou. This is Xia Lin.

18
00:02:36,285 --> 00:02:37,365
Hi, Xiaoyou.

19
00:02:37,445 --> 00:02:38,765
-Hello.
-Nice to meet you.

20
00:02:39,285 --> 00:02:40,765
I feel so close to you already.

21
00:02:44,765 --> 00:02:45,805
Control yourself.

22
00:02:47,725 --> 00:02:49,685
She's so cute.

23
00:02:49,765 --> 00:02:51,085
You made a good choice.

24
00:02:52,285 --> 00:02:53,925
What are you talking about?

25
00:02:55,285 --> 00:02:57,405
I told you she saved me last time.

26
00:02:57,685 --> 00:02:58,685
Oh...

27
00:02:59,205 --> 00:03:02,325
She's the friend you told me about?

28
00:03:04,125 --> 00:03:05,285
That's strange.

29
00:03:05,805 --> 00:03:07,725
Why aren't you taking care of Ling?

30
00:03:07,805 --> 00:03:09,565
-Why are you here?
-I came to look for you.

31
00:03:10,285 --> 00:03:13,525
If I knew going to the bathroom
was your excuse for going on a date,

32
00:03:13,605 --> 00:03:14,725
I wouldn't have bothered you.

33
00:03:16,445 --> 00:03:17,685
I said, it's not a date.

34
00:03:18,085 --> 00:03:20,285
Go away, I don't have time for this.

35
00:03:20,685 --> 00:03:22,205
Do you want to go back to Ling's room?

36
00:03:22,525 --> 00:03:25,125
Or do you want to stay
with your lifesaver?

37
00:03:26,605 --> 00:03:29,005
I'm not going back to watch you two
get all lovey-dovey.

38
00:03:29,805 --> 00:03:32,645
Seize your chance.

39
00:03:32,925 --> 00:03:33,765
Remember,

40
00:03:34,325 --> 00:03:38,325
your face is your biggest asset.

41
00:03:39,165 --> 00:03:40,245
-Go for it.
-Shoo.

42
00:03:40,725 --> 00:03:43,245
Go away!

43
00:03:52,045 --> 00:03:54,125
Don't mind her.
My friend is always like that.

44
00:03:54,205 --> 00:03:55,645
She's a bit weird.

45
00:03:58,085 --> 00:03:59,525
So she's the girl you like.

46
00:04:00,605 --> 00:04:01,445
How do you...

47
00:04:02,805 --> 00:04:05,245
Don't worry. I won't tell anyone.

48
00:04:07,445 --> 00:04:08,805
Is it that obvious?

49
00:04:08,885 --> 00:04:09,765
Yes.

50
00:04:10,965 --> 00:04:14,765
The way you look at her is different
from the way you look at others.

51
00:04:17,085 --> 00:04:20,285
But I heard she's Mrs. Ling
of Lingshi Group.

52
00:04:20,765 --> 00:04:21,605
That's right.

53
00:04:22,404 --> 00:04:24,205
That's why I decided to step aside.

54
00:04:26,284 --> 00:04:27,925
I just want her to be happy.

55
00:04:34,605 --> 00:04:36,165
Why are you looking at me like that?

56
00:04:36,485 --> 00:04:39,125
I had no idea you were a true romantic.

57
00:04:42,045 --> 00:04:42,885
I'm leaving!

58
00:04:43,205 --> 00:04:45,645
I'll walk you out.

59
00:04:46,245 --> 00:04:47,085
Wait for me.

60
00:04:53,285 --> 00:04:55,245
Thank you so much for today. I'm serious.

61
00:04:55,325 --> 00:04:56,965
How many times are you going to thank me?

62
00:04:57,445 --> 00:05:00,165
No amount of words
can express my gratitude.

63
00:05:00,245 --> 00:05:01,725
That's enough.

64
00:05:02,485 --> 00:05:03,925
See you next time.

65
00:05:04,285 --> 00:05:05,605
-Bye.
-Bye.

66
00:05:32,645 --> 00:05:33,885
Guess what I just saw.

67
00:05:33,965 --> 00:05:36,165
Chu Yan was with a girl.

68
00:05:36,405 --> 00:05:39,005
I think we'll hear good news
from him soon.

69
00:05:44,245 --> 00:05:45,165
What's wrong?

70
00:05:46,125 --> 00:05:47,725
Why do you look so serious?

71
00:05:50,205 --> 00:05:51,725
I know what happened at the company.

72
00:05:56,205 --> 00:05:58,645
I didn't mean to ask
Wen Li to hide it from you.

73
00:05:59,325 --> 00:06:01,405
You're still sick.
I didn't want you to worry.

74
00:06:01,965 --> 00:06:04,685
You don't have to hide things from me.
I'm fine.

75
00:06:05,845 --> 00:06:09,165
That's impossible. She's your mother.

76
00:06:12,645 --> 00:06:13,645
Perhaps...

77
00:06:15,005 --> 00:06:17,085
not all mothers are selfless.

78
00:06:18,085 --> 00:06:19,765
She's a mother.

79
00:06:20,605 --> 00:06:21,725
But she's also just human.

80
00:06:25,125 --> 00:06:26,565
I was so dumb.

81
00:06:27,205 --> 00:06:28,685
I trusted her too easily.

82
00:06:29,245 --> 00:06:30,085
You're not dumb.

83
00:06:31,525 --> 00:06:32,765
You're just too kind.

84
00:06:34,405 --> 00:06:36,045
Actually, I could tell that

85
00:06:36,605 --> 00:06:38,045
you had your hopes, too.

86
00:06:42,805 --> 00:06:46,765
Who doesn't hope for their mother's love?

87
00:06:49,245 --> 00:06:50,965
I knew what she was like all along.

88
00:06:51,485 --> 00:06:55,645
But she's even colder
and crueler than I imagined.

89
00:06:56,365 --> 00:06:57,445
This is life.

90
00:07:06,565 --> 00:07:07,485
I'm sorry.

91
00:07:09,045 --> 00:07:10,285
You don't have to apologize.

92
00:07:10,805 --> 00:07:12,325
This has nothing to do with you.

93
00:07:13,165 --> 00:07:15,845
And thanks to you,
we get to keep the company.

94
00:07:17,365 --> 00:07:20,965
Wen Li did it. I didn't do much.

95
00:07:22,005 --> 00:07:23,285
All I want is...

96
00:07:24,325 --> 00:07:27,245
to bring you more happiness.

97
00:07:28,725 --> 00:07:30,725
I already have happiness.

98
00:07:31,325 --> 00:07:32,285
I have you.

99
00:07:33,925 --> 00:07:35,565
Now we have a baby.

100
00:07:37,645 --> 00:07:39,165
I have the world.

101
00:08:02,885 --> 00:08:04,165
Mr. Fu.

102
00:08:08,005 --> 00:08:08,845
What is it?

103
00:08:10,365 --> 00:08:13,405
Can you investigate someone for me?
Her name is Tong Xiaoyou.

104
00:08:13,885 --> 00:08:14,725
Yes, sir.

105
00:08:15,645 --> 00:08:17,885
She's the girl you like?

106
00:08:18,245 --> 00:08:19,765
Just friends.

107
00:08:20,445 --> 00:08:23,845
Focus your investigation
on the wealthy families in Gangdong.

108
00:08:24,805 --> 00:08:25,765
OK. I see.

109
00:08:26,245 --> 00:08:28,325
Wait. Where's the old man?

110
00:08:30,285 --> 00:08:31,325
He's at the office.

111
00:08:31,685 --> 00:08:35,005
The company isn't doing well.
He's been working long hours.

112
00:08:38,245 --> 00:08:39,965
Mr. Fu, just be honest with me.

113
00:08:41,564 --> 00:08:42,405
Yan,

114
00:08:43,125 --> 00:08:44,645
Mr. Chu's body isn't doing well.

115
00:08:44,885 --> 00:08:46,885
His health will suffer
if he continues like this.

116
00:08:47,164 --> 00:08:48,645
Please talk to him.

117
00:08:51,045 --> 00:08:51,885
I understand.

118
00:08:53,125 --> 00:08:54,325
You can go back to work.

119
00:09:24,605 --> 00:09:27,285
Director Ling, will Lingshi Group
fight back against Nantian Group?

120
00:09:27,365 --> 00:09:29,205
What do you think
about what your mother did?

121
00:09:29,285 --> 00:09:30,765
Did family issues cause the fallout?

122
00:09:30,845 --> 00:09:33,365
After all you've been through,
will you have a wedding?

123
00:09:33,445 --> 00:09:35,205
-How many children will you have?
-Let's go.

124
00:09:35,285 --> 00:09:37,365
-Tell us.
-Please say a few words.

125
00:09:37,445 --> 00:09:39,325
Director Ling... tell us what you think.

126
00:09:40,485 --> 00:09:41,485
Please, tell us something.

127
00:09:41,565 --> 00:09:42,565
Please answer.

128
00:09:42,645 --> 00:09:44,445
Director Ling.

129
00:09:50,325 --> 00:09:52,165
These reporters are really enthusiastic.

130
00:09:53,805 --> 00:09:54,645
Mumu.

131
00:09:55,645 --> 00:09:57,165
Let's have a wedding.

132
00:09:58,605 --> 00:09:59,685
That's not necessary.

133
00:10:00,005 --> 00:10:01,485
We've been married for so long.

134
00:10:01,925 --> 00:10:04,205
And I'm pregnant. Let's not fuss over it.

135
00:10:05,725 --> 00:10:08,645
Doesn't every girl dream
about a wedding of the century?

136
00:10:09,765 --> 00:10:11,045
That's true.

137
00:10:11,485 --> 00:10:13,885
But that's for single young girls.

138
00:10:15,005 --> 00:10:17,885
As long as you're always nice to me,

139
00:10:18,485 --> 00:10:21,445
I'll be happy even without a big wedding.

140
00:10:23,685 --> 00:10:24,525
Mumu.

141
00:10:26,525 --> 00:10:29,085
I'll marry you again
on our golden anniversary.

142
00:10:30,165 --> 00:10:31,445
-OK.
-Right now,

143
00:10:32,005 --> 00:10:34,165
I just want to give you
a kiss of the century.

144
00:11:30,605 --> 00:11:31,725
What do you want to say?

145
00:11:33,565 --> 00:11:34,445
Don't worry.

146
00:11:35,725 --> 00:11:39,285
I won't be crying and screaming,
asking you to stay like before.

147
00:11:42,005 --> 00:11:43,645
Tell Mr. Nan,

148
00:11:44,605 --> 00:11:46,925
I won't retaliate against him in business.

149
00:11:48,845 --> 00:11:49,725
Why?

150
00:11:51,605 --> 00:11:53,965
Nan Jintian made me realize
how horrible hate is.

151
00:11:55,405 --> 00:11:57,525
It can twist the mind of a person.

152
00:11:58,685 --> 00:12:00,165
So I've decided not to hate you.

153
00:12:00,525 --> 00:12:01,365
I want to thank you

154
00:12:02,365 --> 00:12:03,685
for giving me life.

155
00:12:04,325 --> 00:12:06,765
Thank you for giving me
the chance to have happiness in life.

156
00:12:12,925 --> 00:12:14,165
Now,

157
00:12:14,925 --> 00:12:16,925
I can better understand
the decision you made.

158
00:12:19,445 --> 00:12:21,885
I've found the person
I can give up everything for.

159
00:12:22,725 --> 00:12:24,285
The person I want to spend my life with.

160
00:12:30,085 --> 00:12:30,925
Mom...

161
00:12:34,565 --> 00:12:35,405
Take care.

162
00:12:55,085 --> 00:12:55,925
Come in.

163
00:13:00,245 --> 00:13:02,805
Yan, I just received some information.

164
00:13:03,245 --> 00:13:04,525
Miss Tong took her mother's name.

165
00:13:05,005 --> 00:13:07,405
So, the investigation
wasn't on the right track.

166
00:13:08,165 --> 00:13:09,005
Got it.

167
00:13:09,765 --> 00:13:12,045
I'll ask them to keep looking.

168
00:13:12,525 --> 00:13:14,605
It's fine, Mr. Fu. Leave it.

169
00:13:14,685 --> 00:13:15,885
I can't help her all her life.

170
00:13:17,205 --> 00:13:18,045
Very well.

171
00:13:18,245 --> 00:13:19,085
Also...

172
00:13:20,085 --> 00:13:22,485
don't tell the old man about this.

173
00:13:23,765 --> 00:13:24,605
Yes, sir.

174
00:13:31,965 --> 00:13:32,965
You have a meeting?

175
00:13:33,485 --> 00:13:34,325
Oh.

176
00:13:34,605 --> 00:13:36,285
I'm going to a business dinner.

177
00:13:37,245 --> 00:13:39,605
Do you mind taking one more person?

178
00:13:40,165 --> 00:13:43,005
I thought you didn't like
this kind of meeting.

179
00:13:43,725 --> 00:13:47,605
I haven't been shooting any movies lately.
It's boring to stay home.

180
00:13:48,005 --> 00:13:49,685
What if it's another blind date for you?

181
00:13:50,325 --> 00:13:52,405
Well, it's about time.

182
00:13:52,605 --> 00:13:55,605
If I meet someone compatible,
I'll get married.

183
00:13:56,485 --> 00:13:57,805
Wait a moment. I'll get changed.

184
00:14:12,085 --> 00:14:12,965
Miss, your shoe...

185
00:14:16,525 --> 00:14:18,125
Your shoe, miss.

186
00:14:28,965 --> 00:14:30,045
Hey!

187
00:14:35,885 --> 00:14:37,285
Does she think she's Cinderella?

188
00:14:43,165 --> 00:14:44,925
This is your son, right?

189
00:14:45,005 --> 00:14:46,885
He's even more handsome than on TV.

190
00:14:46,965 --> 00:14:48,045
Truly a talented man.

191
00:14:48,125 --> 00:14:49,685
You're too kind.

192
00:14:49,965 --> 00:14:51,725
Chu Yan, let me introduce you.

193
00:14:51,805 --> 00:14:53,405
This is Director Ai from Aishi Paper.

194
00:14:53,925 --> 00:14:55,125
Nice to meet you, Mr. Ai.

195
00:14:55,485 --> 00:14:57,085
My daughter is the same age as you.

196
00:14:57,645 --> 00:15:00,405
She studied abroad for many years
and has just returned.

197
00:15:01,245 --> 00:15:03,525
That's great.
They can get to know each other.

198
00:15:03,605 --> 00:15:05,365
I'm sure they'll get along well.

199
00:15:06,965 --> 00:15:08,965
I don't know where she's gone though.

200
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:13,525
I have to take this. Excuse me.

201
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:19,805
<i>Director Ai, I can't find her.</i>

202
00:15:24,725 --> 00:15:25,685
I'm sorry.

203
00:15:25,765 --> 00:15:27,965
My daughter wasn't feeling well.
She went home already.

204
00:15:29,485 --> 00:15:30,885
No problem.

205
00:15:30,965 --> 00:15:32,925
We can introduce them next time.

206
00:15:34,805 --> 00:15:35,845
Mr. Ai,

207
00:15:36,205 --> 00:15:39,285
was she wearing a pink dress?

208
00:15:39,365 --> 00:15:40,245
That's right.

209
00:15:41,885 --> 00:15:42,965
I just saw her.

210
00:15:43,685 --> 00:15:44,805
She's quite interesting.

211
00:15:49,205 --> 00:15:50,085
Good.

212
00:15:50,325 --> 00:15:52,125
You can hang out more.

213
00:15:52,205 --> 00:15:54,165
It's good to make new friends, right?

214
00:15:54,245 --> 00:15:55,485
Yes.

215
00:15:55,565 --> 00:15:57,325
OK, I will.

216
00:15:57,405 --> 00:15:59,725
Let's have a drink.

217
00:16:00,005 --> 00:16:01,165
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

218
00:16:11,405 --> 00:16:12,685
Ling Yizhou.

219
00:16:13,885 --> 00:16:14,845
Ling Yizhou.

220
00:16:16,845 --> 00:16:17,885
Where is he?

221
00:16:20,445 --> 00:16:21,365
You're up early.

222
00:16:22,605 --> 00:16:25,085
I couldn't sleep
because you weren't next to me.

223
00:16:25,445 --> 00:16:27,245
Good. I'm making breakfast for you.

224
00:16:27,685 --> 00:16:29,365
-You?
-Don't underestimate me.

225
00:16:29,885 --> 00:16:30,765
Go freshen up.

226
00:16:39,765 --> 00:16:42,765
You don't look like
a businessman right now.

227
00:16:44,005 --> 00:16:46,845
There's no boss here. Just your man.

228
00:16:50,605 --> 00:16:51,445
Really?

229
00:16:52,525 --> 00:16:54,365
<i>You and Your Charm</i>
will be released tomorrow.

230
00:16:55,085 --> 00:16:57,045
If I become a superstar,

231
00:16:57,485 --> 00:17:00,165
I'll be the breadwinner and support you.
How about that?

232
00:17:00,925 --> 00:17:03,125
Sounds good. I'll think about it.

233
00:17:05,685 --> 00:17:06,805
Can you answer that for me?

234
00:17:11,405 --> 00:17:12,965
Hello, Mr. Wen.

235
00:17:14,445 --> 00:17:15,285
OK.

236
00:17:16,805 --> 00:17:18,084
Hello, what's up?

237
00:17:19,084 --> 00:17:19,925
I'm not going.

238
00:17:20,844 --> 00:17:22,525
Let me know if you can't handle it.

239
00:17:22,604 --> 00:17:23,445
OK.

240
00:17:27,165 --> 00:17:29,005
You really aren't going to work?

241
00:17:29,084 --> 00:17:30,685
Are you unhappy about that?

242
00:17:31,525 --> 00:17:33,324
I'm so happy I might faint.

243
00:17:33,565 --> 00:17:36,725
I just think Mr. Wen works so hard.

244
00:17:36,805 --> 00:17:37,885
I feel bad for him.

245
00:17:38,805 --> 00:17:40,685
I guess I'm still not working hard enough.

246
00:17:41,405 --> 00:17:43,245
Or else why would you think
about another man?

247
00:17:46,405 --> 00:17:48,685
I'll go play with Pidan. You carry on.

248
00:17:50,965 --> 00:17:51,805
Go ahead.

249
00:17:55,445 --> 00:17:57,325
The meeting is adjourned. Thank you.

250
00:17:58,885 --> 00:18:00,045
I need that next week.

251
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:02,725
Mr. Wen, Director Ling is OK now, right?

252
00:18:02,805 --> 00:18:04,325
How come he's not at work?

253
00:18:04,605 --> 00:18:07,485
If those reporters didn't take
photos of him leaving the hospital,

254
00:18:07,885 --> 00:18:09,765
those rumors out there
would have gone wild.

255
00:18:10,125 --> 00:18:12,125
Maybe he hasn't made a full recovery.

256
00:18:13,525 --> 00:18:16,045
I'd be happy to answer
any questions about work.

257
00:18:16,365 --> 00:18:18,685
But I can't answer any other questions.

258
00:18:21,165 --> 00:18:23,165
Mr. Wen is very discreet.

259
00:18:24,405 --> 00:18:26,365
Maybe we can ask the group chat manager

260
00:18:26,925 --> 00:18:28,645
what's going on with Director Ling.

261
00:18:30,045 --> 00:18:33,685
But ever since Mr. Ling was hospitalized,
nothing has been posted in the group chat.

262
00:18:34,285 --> 00:18:37,445
Actually, I've always been very curious
about the manager of the chat.

263
00:18:37,765 --> 00:18:40,405
He knows the director well.
He's good at interpreting what he says.

264
00:18:40,485 --> 00:18:42,765
And he always gets
breaking news right away.

265
00:18:42,845 --> 00:18:46,085
Is it one of you guys?

266
00:18:46,485 --> 00:18:47,445
That's impossible.

267
00:18:47,965 --> 00:18:48,805
Yeah.

268
00:18:49,245 --> 00:18:50,965
Do you want to know who the manager is?

269
00:18:51,845 --> 00:18:53,125
I've got an idea.

270
00:18:57,285 --> 00:19:00,045
Wen Li, I want to play games
on your cell phone.

271
00:19:02,965 --> 00:19:04,285
How many times have I told you?

272
00:19:04,605 --> 00:19:07,845
You have to fold the clothes
before you put them in the closet.

273
00:19:08,045 --> 00:19:10,005
Got it, Mommy.

274
00:19:16,605 --> 00:19:19,205
<i>Group chat manager,</i>
<i>will you have dinner with me tonight?</i>

275
00:19:27,125 --> 00:19:30,605
<i>All previous messages have been deleted.</i>
<i>Something is fishy here.</i>

276
00:19:32,605 --> 00:19:36,125
<i>This isn't his regular account.</i>

277
00:19:37,205 --> 00:19:40,205
<i>Wen Li. How dare you</i>
<i>create a second account?</i>

278
00:19:40,965 --> 00:19:43,485
<i>I'll have to see what you're up to</i>
<i>with this account.</i>

279
00:19:43,565 --> 00:19:45,165
SURE. TIME AND PLACE?

280
00:19:50,365 --> 00:19:53,125
It's not a good idea
to just show up like this.

281
00:19:53,325 --> 00:19:54,485
Why not?

282
00:19:54,565 --> 00:19:56,405
He looks like a goody two-shoes,

283
00:19:56,485 --> 00:19:58,245
but he's talking to girls behind my back.

284
00:19:58,885 --> 00:20:01,565
Did you ask Wen Li about this?
Maybe it's a misunderstanding.

285
00:20:01,965 --> 00:20:04,285
Impossible. I have screen shots.

286
00:20:04,845 --> 00:20:06,605
When I get the proof,
I'll break up with him.

287
00:20:06,685 --> 00:20:07,765
Don't do anything rash.

288
00:20:08,725 --> 00:20:09,885
Are you going to chicken out?

289
00:20:11,965 --> 00:20:14,965
No... I'm pregnant now.

290
00:20:15,445 --> 00:20:17,245
You wouldn't get into a fight, would you?

291
00:20:17,685 --> 00:20:20,445
Don't worry. We're civilized people.

292
00:20:22,005 --> 00:20:23,405
Don't be afraid. Come in.

293
00:20:33,285 --> 00:20:34,565
You're the group chat manager?

294
00:20:35,205 --> 00:20:36,965
Wrong room.

295
00:20:40,165 --> 00:20:41,125
What's going on?

296
00:20:41,485 --> 00:20:42,325
Mumu.

297
00:20:48,205 --> 00:20:49,925
Didn't you two go to the movies?

298
00:20:50,765 --> 00:20:52,405
-What are you doing here?
-What's going on?

299
00:20:52,485 --> 00:20:54,565
We got thirsty on the way.

300
00:20:57,805 --> 00:21:00,445
Wait. How did you know I was here?

301
00:21:03,325 --> 00:21:04,565
Wen Li told me.

302
00:21:09,965 --> 00:21:12,565
It's late. Don't stay here.
Come home with me.

303
00:21:15,005 --> 00:21:15,845
Excuse us.

304
00:21:20,445 --> 00:21:23,165
Could Mr. Ling be the group chat manager?

305
00:21:23,805 --> 00:21:25,085
-What?
-What's going on?

306
00:21:25,805 --> 00:21:26,645
I have no idea.

307
00:21:33,445 --> 00:21:36,005
Can I ask a question?

308
00:21:36,405 --> 00:21:38,485
Who messaged Wen Li?

309
00:21:38,885 --> 00:21:39,805
Wen Li?

310
00:21:40,125 --> 00:21:41,405
Wen Li...

311
00:21:47,165 --> 00:21:48,445
You tried to catch me in the act?

312
00:21:49,645 --> 00:21:51,125
I made a mistake.

313
00:21:52,005 --> 00:21:54,725
I care about you too much.

314
00:21:54,965 --> 00:21:56,645
I'm afraid someone else might steal you.

315
00:21:57,605 --> 00:21:59,325
You're too good.

316
00:21:59,405 --> 00:22:01,045
You must be blind to like me.

317
00:22:01,565 --> 00:22:03,085
I lack self-confidence.

318
00:22:04,005 --> 00:22:07,845
Moreover, they got the prettiest girl
at Lingshi to message you.

319
00:22:07,925 --> 00:22:10,165
I got caught up in the moment...

320
00:22:11,285 --> 00:22:14,125
I'm sorry.

321
00:22:14,405 --> 00:22:17,045
I exposed you as the group chat manager.

322
00:22:17,525 --> 00:22:19,205
Don't be upset.

323
00:22:20,205 --> 00:22:21,045
I'm not upset.

324
00:22:23,365 --> 00:22:24,405
Really?

325
00:22:24,485 --> 00:22:25,325
Yeah.

326
00:22:27,285 --> 00:22:28,365
You didn't see it.

327
00:22:28,565 --> 00:22:32,325
When those senior officers found out
you were the chat manager,

328
00:22:33,045 --> 00:22:35,165
the room went crazy.

329
00:22:35,445 --> 00:22:37,125
They were all stunned.

330
00:22:38,965 --> 00:22:40,125
You have no idea.

331
00:22:42,205 --> 00:22:45,085
Where did you get the idea
of creating a group chat?

332
00:22:45,685 --> 00:22:47,245
I got the inspiration from <i>Gossip Girl</i>.

333
00:22:58,165 --> 00:22:59,365
What are you doing?

334
00:22:59,445 --> 00:23:00,765
This is a great story.

335
00:23:01,125 --> 00:23:04,885
The poker-faced executive assistant
turns out to be the group chat manager.

336
00:23:06,165 --> 00:23:07,045
What a contrast.

337
00:23:07,325 --> 00:23:09,165
I'll write this into my novel.

338
00:23:09,405 --> 00:23:11,485
It will spice up your character.

339
00:23:12,485 --> 00:23:13,685
My character?

340
00:23:14,045 --> 00:23:14,885
Yes.

341
00:23:17,525 --> 00:23:20,325
"The stern-faced executive assistant
of the overbearing director"?

342
00:23:23,605 --> 00:23:26,205
These are just character archetypes.

343
00:23:26,645 --> 00:23:29,165
No one would know
it's you and Director Ling.

344
00:23:33,045 --> 00:23:36,285
I'm a bit tired. I want to go to bed now.

345
00:23:36,365 --> 00:23:37,205
Goodnight.

346
00:23:41,285 --> 00:23:42,125
Stop.

347
00:23:48,405 --> 00:23:49,365
You can write the story.

348
00:23:49,765 --> 00:23:50,605
Really?

349
00:23:51,005 --> 00:23:53,485
But you'll have to pay the price.

350
00:24:04,565 --> 00:24:07,285
YOU AND YOUR CHARM MOVIE PREMIERE

351
00:24:07,365 --> 00:24:08,325
-Thank you.
-Look here.

352
00:24:08,405 --> 00:24:09,605
OK. Thank you. Here.

353
00:24:09,685 --> 00:24:11,645
-Shuangshuang, can you look here?
-I love you.

354
00:24:12,925 --> 00:24:14,285
Chu Yan, can you look here?

355
00:24:15,085 --> 00:24:15,965
Thank you.

356
00:24:17,405 --> 00:24:18,885
-I love you, Chu Yan.
-Thank you.

357
00:24:25,845 --> 00:24:27,085
Why are you hiding?

358
00:24:27,525 --> 00:24:29,485
You used to charge ahead
when you saw the camera.

359
00:24:29,925 --> 00:24:31,285
I just did a cameo.

360
00:24:31,885 --> 00:24:33,565
I don't want to steal their spotlight.

361
00:24:35,285 --> 00:24:36,285
Let me tell you something,

362
00:24:36,365 --> 00:24:38,245
I love your overflowing confidence.

363
00:24:38,805 --> 00:24:39,805
Let me see.

364
00:24:40,965 --> 00:24:42,165
Touch up your makeup.

365
00:24:42,525 --> 00:24:44,365
When it starts,
they will take your photos.

366
00:24:45,245 --> 00:24:47,485
Do you really think
those reporters care about me?

367
00:24:48,005 --> 00:24:49,605
They just want Ling Yizhou.

368
00:24:50,965 --> 00:24:53,165
Director Ling has reached
celebrity status.

369
00:24:54,685 --> 00:24:57,245
Maybe I'll cast him in a cameo role.

370
00:24:57,605 --> 00:24:58,925
Stop your imagination.

371
00:24:59,005 --> 00:25:00,765
Otherwise I'll tell Wen Li.

372
00:25:01,245 --> 00:25:02,565
Come on. Gals before pals.

373
00:25:06,525 --> 00:25:08,725
I'll go talk to the director.
I'll be back.

374
00:25:08,805 --> 00:25:09,885
Go ahead.

375
00:25:23,005 --> 00:25:24,285
<i>How's the premiere?</i>

376
00:25:29,045 --> 00:25:30,805
<i>Lots of handsome guys.</i>

377
00:25:30,885 --> 00:25:33,245
<i>And one pretty girl.</i>

378
00:25:35,405 --> 00:25:38,005
<i>What a shame. I should have gone</i>
<i>to see the pretty girl.</i>

379
00:25:39,965 --> 00:25:43,445
<i>Go back to work. Don't miss me too much.</i>

380
00:25:51,365 --> 00:25:53,925
<i>Linlin, come see me in room 103.</i>

381
00:25:58,405 --> 00:26:00,285
Shuangshuang, what do you think?

382
00:26:23,845 --> 00:26:24,685
Where did she go?

383
00:26:26,245 --> 00:26:27,285
Where is she?

384
00:26:29,885 --> 00:26:32,485
I started a youth screenwriter alliance
with the film association.

385
00:26:32,565 --> 00:26:34,725
You can bring your work
and join us if you're interested.

386
00:26:35,605 --> 00:26:38,325
OK. I'm working on a new story lately.

387
00:26:38,405 --> 00:26:40,005
But I only have an outline right now.

388
00:26:40,085 --> 00:26:41,525
-It's OK.
-Really?

389
00:26:41,605 --> 00:26:44,525
We can talk more when we finish
promoting <i>You and Your Charm</i>.

390
00:26:44,965 --> 00:26:46,245
-No problem.
-Mr. Tsai.

391
00:26:46,685 --> 00:26:48,045
Xia Lin isn't in the dressing room.

392
00:26:48,125 --> 00:26:50,005
She's not? I'll call her.

393
00:26:50,645 --> 00:26:52,165
I just did. She didn't answer.

394
00:26:53,845 --> 00:26:55,085
My cell phone has gone.

395
00:26:57,685 --> 00:26:59,765
-The film's starting. Where are you going?
-Chu Yan!

396
00:27:10,005 --> 00:27:10,885
<i>Come alone.</i>

397
00:27:46,525 --> 00:27:47,965
Here we are again.

398
00:27:48,365 --> 00:27:50,965
I knew it was you, Nan Jintian.

399
00:27:53,405 --> 00:27:57,365
You don't seem surprised to see me alive.

400
00:27:57,925 --> 00:28:00,205
You got a dead body for Chu Yan.

401
00:28:01,525 --> 00:28:05,205
It's not hard to get
another one for yourself.

402
00:28:06,965 --> 00:28:07,925
Very smart.

403
00:28:09,325 --> 00:28:11,285
You're really good at stirring up drama.

404
00:28:11,365 --> 00:28:12,645
Are you having fun?

405
00:28:13,445 --> 00:28:15,285
You're my only friend in the country.

406
00:28:16,165 --> 00:28:17,405
Of course I wouldn't leave you.

407
00:28:18,565 --> 00:28:21,325
You survived.
Why don't you cherish your life?

408
00:28:21,965 --> 00:28:23,525
Why do you have to destroy everything?

409
00:28:25,005 --> 00:28:26,205
I have a new plan.

410
00:28:27,885 --> 00:28:29,525
But I need help from you and Ling Yizhou.

411
00:28:30,085 --> 00:28:32,605
You've hurt Yizhou once.
What else do you want?

412
00:28:33,005 --> 00:28:36,965
Don't worry.
I won't let him die this time.

413
00:28:45,445 --> 00:28:46,285
Mumu!

414
00:28:46,805 --> 00:28:48,565
-Mumu!
-No! Stop right there.

415
00:28:48,645 --> 00:28:50,285
I'll get nervous if you get too close.

416
00:28:51,005 --> 00:28:51,845
Mumu, are you OK?

417
00:28:52,125 --> 00:28:53,805
I'm fine. Be careful.

418
00:28:54,325 --> 00:28:55,165
Ling Yizhou.

419
00:28:56,205 --> 00:28:58,685
How does it feel to be set up
by your own birth mother?

420
00:28:59,165 --> 00:29:00,845
You know everything.
Why are you doing this?

421
00:29:01,405 --> 00:29:03,285
Revenge is meaningless to you now.

422
00:29:03,925 --> 00:29:07,685
I was going to ruin your life
to make that woman suffer more.

423
00:29:08,565 --> 00:29:09,685
I had no idea

424
00:29:10,045 --> 00:29:11,525
that she didn't care about you at all.

425
00:29:12,325 --> 00:29:13,565
We're both the same.

426
00:29:14,325 --> 00:29:15,965
We were both abandoned.

427
00:29:16,045 --> 00:29:17,285
You're not the same.

428
00:29:17,805 --> 00:29:20,765
You choose to hate the world
in the most extreme way.

429
00:29:21,365 --> 00:29:25,965
Yizhou chooses to let go of the past
and create a better present.

430
00:29:26,445 --> 00:29:28,885
The only good thing in my life
has been destroyed by that woman.

431
00:29:29,325 --> 00:29:30,165
Nan Jintian.

432
00:29:31,725 --> 00:29:33,525
Just tell me what you want.

433
00:29:37,485 --> 00:29:38,405
I have a plan.

434
00:29:38,765 --> 00:29:39,605
Tell me.

435
00:29:40,605 --> 00:29:44,205
Why don't we work together
since we have a common enemy?

436
00:29:44,645 --> 00:29:45,685
How do you want to do that?

437
00:29:46,125 --> 00:29:49,405
First, I want to leave Gangdong safely.

438
00:29:50,005 --> 00:29:51,765
Then, we work together
to destroy that woman.

439
00:29:52,565 --> 00:29:55,725
But to make sure everything goes well,
she has to come with me.

440
00:29:55,805 --> 00:30:00,085
Impossible. I can give you
anything else you want. Let Mumu go.

441
00:30:01,285 --> 00:30:02,285
Ling Yizhou!

442
00:30:03,485 --> 00:30:04,965
You don't have any bargaining chips.

443
00:30:06,205 --> 00:30:08,765
Stop! I'll do it.

444
00:30:16,805 --> 00:30:19,085
-Did you call the cops?
-No, I didn't.

445
00:30:19,885 --> 00:30:21,365
You abducted her from the premiere.

446
00:30:21,765 --> 00:30:23,685
People would have found out
and called the police.

447
00:30:23,765 --> 00:30:24,845
Just leave now.

448
00:30:24,925 --> 00:30:26,245
Leave her. I can help you.

449
00:30:26,685 --> 00:30:29,605
You need to see blood
to understand the situation?

450
00:30:30,365 --> 00:30:31,885
Give me some time to think about it.

451
00:30:33,885 --> 00:30:36,405
Give me your answer now.

452
00:30:36,805 --> 00:30:40,645
Or I'll cut up her face.

453
00:30:42,285 --> 00:30:45,245
Nan Jintian,
your mother must have loved you, right?

454
00:30:45,725 --> 00:30:47,485
If she's watching you
right now from heaven,

455
00:30:48,005 --> 00:30:51,045
she wouldn't want you
to waste your life on revenge.

456
00:30:52,205 --> 00:30:53,685
Have you ever lived for yourself?

457
00:30:54,125 --> 00:30:56,205
If one day you disappeared
from this world,

458
00:30:56,965 --> 00:31:00,485
and no one missed you or cried for you,

459
00:31:01,365 --> 00:31:02,925
would it have been worth it?

460
00:31:03,925 --> 00:31:04,885
Shut your mouth.

461
00:31:06,125 --> 00:31:09,285
If you have time to talk to me,
persuade Ling Yizhou to work with me.

462
00:31:14,645 --> 00:31:16,125
Mumu, are you OK?

463
00:31:16,365 --> 00:31:17,525
-I'm OK.
-Hurry!

464
00:31:19,965 --> 00:31:21,525
Stop moving. Stay still.

465
00:31:26,725 --> 00:31:28,165
-Take him.
-Yes, sir.

466
00:31:29,525 --> 00:31:30,365
Get up.

467
00:31:33,605 --> 00:31:34,445
Let's go.

468
00:31:36,165 --> 00:31:37,165
Get in.

469
00:31:40,165 --> 00:31:41,005
Let's go.

470
00:31:43,405 --> 00:31:44,925
Mr. Ling, we're taking him in.

471
00:31:58,925 --> 00:32:00,845
Chu Yan, what are you doing here?

472
00:32:02,085 --> 00:32:03,325
What are you talking about?

473
00:32:03,405 --> 00:32:05,925
Try to be grateful. I called the police.

474
00:32:06,005 --> 00:32:08,045
Otherwise you two
would have been in trouble.

475
00:32:09,165 --> 00:32:10,005
Are you OK?

476
00:32:10,965 --> 00:32:11,805
I'm fine.

477
00:32:12,965 --> 00:32:16,165
You wouldn't let me follow you.
See what happens?

478
00:32:17,965 --> 00:32:20,005
I can't save you both.

479
00:32:20,085 --> 00:32:21,045
You...

480
00:32:21,725 --> 00:32:23,205
Thank you, Chu Yan.

481
00:32:25,525 --> 00:32:26,365
That's more like it.

482
00:32:30,645 --> 00:32:31,965
Now we can finally live in peace.

483
00:32:41,845 --> 00:32:43,045
Hello, old man.

484
00:32:44,725 --> 00:32:46,325
I've been waiting for so long.

485
00:32:46,405 --> 00:32:49,605
Is Miss Ai under the weather again?

486
00:32:50,125 --> 00:32:52,645
Girls need time to dress up. Be patient.

487
00:32:53,845 --> 00:32:54,885
I'm telling you,

488
00:32:54,965 --> 00:32:56,525
her score is negative right now.

489
00:32:56,605 --> 00:32:58,005
I'll give her ten more minutes.

490
00:32:58,085 --> 00:33:00,285
I'll just leave if she doesn't show up.

491
00:33:12,285 --> 00:33:13,405
Tong Xiaoyou?

492
00:33:15,005 --> 00:33:15,965
It's you?

493
00:33:17,245 --> 00:33:18,285
Long time no see.

494
00:33:18,965 --> 00:33:20,365
You really turned into a princess.

495
00:33:21,765 --> 00:33:23,645
Quit teasing me.

496
00:33:26,165 --> 00:33:28,685
By the way, what happened
at the hospital last time?

497
00:33:28,765 --> 00:33:29,805
Who was chasing you?

498
00:33:30,645 --> 00:33:32,285
My dad made me go back to him.

499
00:33:35,445 --> 00:33:36,765
But I talked to your mom.

500
00:33:36,845 --> 00:33:38,885
She doesn't seem to know any of this.

501
00:33:39,365 --> 00:33:41,525
My mom doesn't like it
when I talk to my dad.

502
00:33:42,165 --> 00:33:44,405
I didn't want to trigger her.

503
00:33:45,645 --> 00:33:47,365
But white lies are still lies.

504
00:33:47,685 --> 00:33:49,085
I didn't want to lie to her.

505
00:33:49,685 --> 00:33:51,685
I just don't know how to tell her.

506
00:33:52,365 --> 00:33:54,245
And you're still in the mood for tea?

507
00:33:57,725 --> 00:33:59,565
I was forced here.

508
00:34:03,045 --> 00:34:03,885
Do you need help?

509
00:34:05,205 --> 00:34:06,205
You can help?

510
00:34:07,605 --> 00:34:09,285
When I count to three, we'll run away.

511
00:34:10,245 --> 00:34:12,485
One, two...

512
00:34:18,965 --> 00:34:20,724
Run, silly!

513
00:34:22,845 --> 00:34:23,684
Miss Ai!

514
00:34:46,885 --> 00:34:47,965
Yan, you're home.

515
00:34:48,805 --> 00:34:49,724
How's it going?

516
00:34:50,285 --> 00:34:52,244
Not bad. Where's the old man?

517
00:34:52,644 --> 00:34:54,244
He's in the study. You can go see him.

518
00:35:11,165 --> 00:35:12,005
Dad.

519
00:35:12,725 --> 00:35:13,565
You're home.

520
00:35:15,965 --> 00:35:17,725
I've been thinking about something.

521
00:35:18,085 --> 00:35:20,725
While good looks can give you
an advantage in the society,

522
00:35:20,805 --> 00:35:22,485
ultimately, it's your ability that counts.

523
00:35:24,125 --> 00:35:25,965
What are you beating around the bush for?

524
00:35:26,045 --> 00:35:27,405
Just tell me what you're thinking.

525
00:35:29,365 --> 00:35:30,565
I've decided to quit showbiz.

526
00:35:30,645 --> 00:35:32,605
I'll assume the position of CEO
at our company.

527
00:35:34,205 --> 00:35:36,485
I thought you never liked business.

528
00:35:37,485 --> 00:35:39,845
Now you're stepping up
even before I ask you to.

529
00:35:40,245 --> 00:35:41,085
What happened to you?

530
00:35:43,165 --> 00:35:44,885
Miss Ai rejected me.

531
00:35:45,645 --> 00:35:47,125
My looks aren't good enough for her.

532
00:35:47,445 --> 00:35:49,405
I have to show my abilities
to save face for you.

533
00:35:49,765 --> 00:35:51,085
She stood you up?

534
00:35:52,965 --> 00:35:55,845
I heard you talked to her for a while.

535
00:35:55,925 --> 00:35:58,845
Then you ran away hand in hand
and got rid of the body guards.

536
00:36:00,725 --> 00:36:02,685
What show are you putting on now?

537
00:36:05,085 --> 00:36:06,205
That girl was Miss Ai?

538
00:36:06,685 --> 00:36:07,645
Yes.

539
00:36:08,245 --> 00:36:12,005
I had no idea you two were an item.
I was worried for you.

540
00:36:19,365 --> 00:36:22,245
Pidan, look at the new shirt I bought you.

541
00:36:22,325 --> 00:36:23,325
I'll put it on for you.

542
00:36:23,405 --> 00:36:24,725
Do you want to put it on, Pidan?

543
00:36:25,645 --> 00:36:27,445
Honey, put it on for him.

544
00:36:28,645 --> 00:36:30,285
Pidan is a boy.

545
00:36:30,365 --> 00:36:32,565
And this is too small for him.

546
00:36:32,885 --> 00:36:34,085
Don't you like girls?

547
00:36:34,605 --> 00:36:36,165
We can put it on for him.

548
00:36:36,525 --> 00:36:38,685
It will feel like we have
a little princess at home.

549
00:36:39,565 --> 00:36:40,405
What do you think?

550
00:36:43,605 --> 00:36:44,445
Yeah.

551
00:36:44,805 --> 00:36:46,365
Good thinking, my lovely wife.

552
00:36:46,925 --> 00:36:48,685
Go ahead.

553
00:36:49,365 --> 00:36:50,365
Pidan.

554
00:36:51,085 --> 00:36:51,925
Pidan.

555
00:36:52,605 --> 00:36:53,525
Come here, Pidan.

556
00:36:54,725 --> 00:36:57,365
What are you doing here?

557
00:36:58,125 --> 00:37:00,125
-We're busy. Unlike you.
-Linlin.

558
00:37:00,725 --> 00:37:02,165
What are you talking about?

559
00:37:03,205 --> 00:37:04,045
Linlin.

560
00:37:06,525 --> 00:37:09,845
How are things going between you two?

561
00:37:11,325 --> 00:37:12,685
We're just friends.

562
00:37:15,325 --> 00:37:17,565
We're also family friends.

563
00:37:19,365 --> 00:37:22,365
Romantic relationships
often start out from friendships.

564
00:37:22,965 --> 00:37:24,245
I have high hopes for you two.

565
00:37:26,085 --> 00:37:27,165
What are you talking about?

566
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:28,325
None of your business.

567
00:37:28,925 --> 00:37:30,445
Linlin, I'll go get some glasses.

568
00:37:31,965 --> 00:37:33,885
Look. You scared her away.

569
00:37:35,285 --> 00:37:36,685
Are you smearing my image again?

570
00:37:36,765 --> 00:37:38,525
When have you ever had an image?

571
00:37:38,805 --> 00:37:41,125
I forgot to congratulate you
on winning Best Actor.

572
00:37:42,245 --> 00:37:44,725
But without Jia Fei's great script,

573
00:37:44,805 --> 00:37:46,805
you wouldn't have won, so don't be cocky.

574
00:37:47,885 --> 00:37:49,485
I think you are jealous of me.

575
00:37:49,565 --> 00:37:52,445
Two years of hard work,
and you're still a D-list celebrity.

576
00:37:52,685 --> 00:37:55,005
I don't think you'll ever win
Best Actress.

577
00:37:55,085 --> 00:37:56,565
-Say that again.
-She's hurting me.

578
00:37:56,645 --> 00:37:58,405
-Watch your mouth.
-Stop it now.

579
00:37:59,085 --> 00:38:01,325
-Who does he think he is?
-That's my godson in there.

580
00:38:01,565 --> 00:38:02,525
Careful.

581
00:38:02,845 --> 00:38:05,205
You have to remember
that you're pregnant at all times.

582
00:38:06,565 --> 00:38:07,565
-I'm fine.
-Sit down.

583
00:38:09,405 --> 00:38:11,325
Have you seen Wen Li?

584
00:38:11,925 --> 00:38:13,045
Wen Li?

585
00:38:13,685 --> 00:38:15,965
I think he's talking to Yizhou about work.

586
00:38:16,925 --> 00:38:19,205
Those workaholics.
They're always talking about work.

587
00:38:21,125 --> 00:38:22,685
<i>You and Your Charm</i> has been nominated.

588
00:38:23,165 --> 00:38:25,005
We can go to the award ceremony together.

589
00:38:25,325 --> 00:38:26,205
Really?

590
00:38:26,845 --> 00:38:31,485
But what dress could I wear like this?

591
00:38:32,525 --> 00:38:35,085
Director Ling will find a dress for you.

592
00:38:35,485 --> 00:38:37,605
-Come on.
-Feifei, you were looking for me?

593
00:38:37,925 --> 00:38:41,445
Yeah. I couldn't reach the bottle of wine.
Can you help me?

594
00:38:41,525 --> 00:38:42,445
-OK.
-Let's go.

595
00:38:44,565 --> 00:38:45,605
-Mumu.
-Grandma.

596
00:38:46,445 --> 00:38:48,205
Just sit. It's fine.

597
00:38:49,125 --> 00:38:50,045
Be careful.

598
00:38:57,365 --> 00:38:59,765
Mumu, what are you smiling about?

599
00:39:00,485 --> 00:39:01,325
Grandma.

600
00:39:01,685 --> 00:39:04,285
I feel so happy right now.

601
00:39:04,925 --> 00:39:07,045
Are you happy? Hi, Grandma.

602
00:39:07,125 --> 00:39:08,245
-Mrs. Ling.
-Hello.

603
00:39:08,325 --> 00:39:10,405
-Mrs. Ling.
-Have a seat.

604
00:39:18,045 --> 00:39:21,365
Mumu, happy two-year anniversary.

605
00:39:24,925 --> 00:39:26,005
-Here!
-Happy anniversary.

606
00:39:26,085 --> 00:39:28,205
Happy anniversary!

607
00:39:32,885 --> 00:39:34,165
You're pregnant. No drinking.

608
00:39:34,925 --> 00:39:35,925
OK.

609
00:39:36,005 --> 00:39:37,925
Linlin, when's the baby due?

610
00:39:38,405 --> 00:39:39,565
The baby is overdue.

611
00:39:39,845 --> 00:39:41,925
I'm afraid he'll come out at any time.

612
00:39:43,285 --> 00:39:44,805
This baby is smart.

613
00:39:45,605 --> 00:39:48,285
He's not coming out too early
to see his parents.

614
00:39:50,445 --> 00:39:53,125
Single people think couples
are always showing off.

615
00:39:54,565 --> 00:39:57,405
Yan, when are you getting married?

616
00:39:57,485 --> 00:39:59,445
I'm waiting for your wedding invitation.

617
00:40:01,525 --> 00:40:03,005
I want to get married, too.

618
00:40:03,365 --> 00:40:06,125
But I'm so outstanding.
I'm liked by so many people.

619
00:40:06,205 --> 00:40:09,325
If I get married to one girl,
other girls will be upset.

620
00:40:11,165 --> 00:40:12,685
Where's my Wen Li?

621
00:40:13,405 --> 00:40:19,045
<i>You asked me how much I love you</i>

622
00:40:19,765 --> 00:40:23,365
<i>How deep my love is</i>

623
00:40:23,445 --> 00:40:25,005
I thought it was my wedding anniversary.

624
00:40:25,885 --> 00:40:27,645
Who gave him permission to do that?

625
00:40:27,965 --> 00:40:28,885
Me.

626
00:40:29,405 --> 00:40:31,205
Wen Li and I planned this together.

627
00:40:31,485 --> 00:40:32,365
Surprised?

628
00:40:32,445 --> 00:40:37,885
<i>The moon represents my heart</i>

629
00:40:49,845 --> 00:40:52,085
Feifei, will you marry me?

630
00:40:52,885 --> 00:40:53,725
I will.

631
00:40:54,045 --> 00:40:56,645
No. He's mine.

632
00:40:57,685 --> 00:40:58,645
Yes, I will.

633
00:41:03,885 --> 00:41:06,885
Wen Li, a hug is not enough. Kiss her!

634
00:41:07,565 --> 00:41:10,285
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

635
00:41:10,365 --> 00:41:14,165
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

636
00:41:16,285 --> 00:41:18,565
That's not enough. Use your tongue.

637
00:41:20,045 --> 00:41:21,845
Use your tongue! Use your tongue!

638
00:41:21,925 --> 00:41:25,165
Use your tongue! Use your tongue!

639
00:41:29,445 --> 00:41:30,805
The baby is coming...

640
00:41:30,885 --> 00:41:33,165
Ling Yizhou. The baby is coming out!

641
00:41:34,165 --> 00:41:35,685
-Mumu!
-The baby is coming out!

642
00:41:35,765 --> 00:41:36,805
Mumu, sit down!

643
00:41:37,245 --> 00:41:39,445
Grandma, I'm going to be a dad!
Mumu is having the baby!

644
00:41:39,925 --> 00:41:41,925
What are you smiling about?
It hurts so bad!

645
00:41:42,005 --> 00:41:44,085
Mr. Wu, get the car. Hurry!
Mrs. Ling is in labor!

646
00:41:44,405 --> 00:41:46,605
Mumu, you can do this.

647
00:41:46,685 --> 00:41:48,965
You can do this!

648
00:41:49,045 --> 00:41:51,765
You can do this!

649
00:41:52,005 --> 00:41:54,445
You can do this!

650
00:41:54,605 --> 00:41:57,365
You can do this!

651
00:41:57,445 --> 00:41:59,765
Go, Mumu...

652
00:42:00,245 --> 00:42:02,405
Go!

653
00:42:02,485 --> 00:42:04,925
Go!

654
00:42:14,685 --> 00:42:17,645
LING YIZHOU AND XIA LIN'S
TWO-YEAR ANNIVERSARY PARTY

655
00:42:19,485 --> 00:42:21,445
We heard you'll be
in a Hollywood movie, right?

656
00:42:21,525 --> 00:42:24,045
You said you wanted a girlfriend.
Any update?

657
00:42:24,125 --> 00:42:25,445

What's your relationship with Miss Ai?

659
00:42:27,645 --> 00:42:28,845
Please tell us.

660
00:42:28,925 --> 00:42:29,885
-Tell us.
-Yeah.

661
00:42:29,965 --> 00:42:32,485
Sorry, guys.
My friend is here to pick me up.

662
00:42:32,565 --> 00:42:34,725
-When will you talk about your girlfriend?
-Tell us.

663
00:42:36,845 --> 00:42:37,725
Let's go.

664
00:42:41,205 --> 00:42:42,045
Bye.

665
00:42:45,325 --> 00:42:48,845
OK. Stop crying now.

666
00:42:48,925 --> 00:42:50,405
Stop crying, baby.

667
00:42:51,445 --> 00:42:52,605
I'm sorry, baby.

668
00:42:52,685 --> 00:42:54,125
We won't have the meeting, OK?

669
00:42:54,205 --> 00:42:55,485
We'll leave now.

670
00:42:55,565 --> 00:42:57,885
No meeting. Let's go, baby.

671
00:42:58,365 --> 00:43:00,485
Let's go drink some milk.

672
00:43:00,565 --> 00:43:02,125
Stop crying. Let's go have some milk.

673
00:43:06,445 --> 00:43:08,325
Look who's here, baby.

674
00:43:09,645 --> 00:43:11,005
Look who's here?

675
00:43:11,085 --> 00:43:13,125
Was he a good boy today?

676
00:43:13,525 --> 00:43:15,125
He was. He only cried once.

677
00:43:15,805 --> 00:43:16,685
That's my good boy.

678
00:43:17,205 --> 00:43:20,325
The second quarter reports are out.
They're ready for your approval.

679
00:43:21,085 --> 00:43:22,965
I don't have time. I got the role.

680
00:43:23,045 --> 00:43:24,925
-I need to go film on set.
-Again?

681
00:43:26,885 --> 00:43:30,165
For our son's sake,
you can come along this time.

682
00:43:30,725 --> 00:43:31,565
Thank you, Mrs. Ling.

683
00:43:33,005 --> 00:43:34,125
Let's go, baby.

684
00:45:06,085 --> 00:45:07,845
