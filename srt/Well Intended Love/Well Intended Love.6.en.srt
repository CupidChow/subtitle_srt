1
00:00:13,405 --> 00:00:16,525
I want to bring a dog home.
Just for a few days.

2
00:00:16,805 --> 00:00:17,645
No way.

3
00:00:18,525 --> 00:00:20,605
My friend asked me
to watch his dog for two days.

4
00:00:21,285 --> 00:00:23,605
Can you help me persuade Ling Yizhou?

5
00:00:24,205 --> 00:00:26,045
If I hadn't gone abroad two years ago,

6
00:00:26,525 --> 00:00:30,405
I'd be married to you right now,
wouldn't I?

7
00:00:31,965 --> 00:00:32,885
An Ran.

8
00:00:33,925 --> 00:00:35,925
Some things in this world
are destined to be.

9
00:00:36,565 --> 00:00:39,605
No matter how many times you reset it,
the results will still be the same.

10
00:00:42,365 --> 00:00:47,045
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

11
00:02:13,044 --> 00:02:15,965
EPISODE 6

12
00:02:18,045 --> 00:02:20,965
I'm writing a story based on
Ling Yizhou and Chu Yan.

13
00:02:21,045 --> 00:02:25,885
A gripping romance between
a business mogul and a movie star.

14
00:02:25,965 --> 00:02:26,805
What do you think?

15
00:02:27,365 --> 00:02:30,005
Feifei, could you talk
about something else?

16
00:02:30,085 --> 00:02:32,405
Stop bringing up Ling Yizhou all the time.

17
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:33,565
What's wrong now?

18
00:02:33,645 --> 00:02:35,565
You two still aren't getting along?

19
00:02:37,245 --> 00:02:41,885
When it comes to Ling Yizhou,
I need to re-evaluate the way I...

20
00:02:42,205 --> 00:02:43,125
The way you what?

21
00:02:44,165 --> 00:02:45,565
The way I...

22
00:02:46,245 --> 00:02:48,885
Did the boss man plant a tracker on you?

23
00:02:48,965 --> 00:02:49,845
What do you mean?

24
00:02:56,405 --> 00:02:58,005
What a coincidence. Have you eaten yet?

25
00:02:58,245 --> 00:02:59,085
Not yet.

26
00:03:00,085 --> 00:03:01,285
I just happen to be free.

27
00:03:01,565 --> 00:03:02,405
Let's go eat.

28
00:03:02,765 --> 00:03:03,605
Sounds good.

29
00:03:05,365 --> 00:03:08,365
Come on. He can afford to pay for a meal.

30
00:03:11,285 --> 00:03:13,365
Were you really just driving by?

31
00:03:15,165 --> 00:03:16,365
I came to pick you up.

32
00:03:18,645 --> 00:03:20,445
He came to pick you up.

33
00:03:20,525 --> 00:03:22,645
You're very considerate, Mr. Ling.

34
00:03:23,445 --> 00:03:25,085
Don't be so stubborn.

35
00:03:25,165 --> 00:03:26,445
-Get in.
-What are you doing?

36
00:03:26,525 --> 00:03:27,405
Hurry up. Get in.

37
00:03:29,925 --> 00:03:30,765
Let's go.

38
00:03:34,965 --> 00:03:36,845
You're not getting in, Mr. Ling? Come on.

39
00:04:04,325 --> 00:04:06,325
Miss Jia, you can order whatever you want.

40
00:04:06,405 --> 00:04:07,405
I already ordered some.

41
00:04:08,125 --> 00:04:10,245
We'd love to have
whatever Mr. Ling is having.

42
00:04:10,325 --> 00:04:12,565
My taste buds aligned with Linlin's
a long time ago.

43
00:04:12,965 --> 00:04:15,045
But I'd like to order something spicy.

44
00:04:16,565 --> 00:04:17,965
He doesn't eat spicy food.

45
00:04:18,485 --> 00:04:19,805
I ate it at Grandma's place.

46
00:04:22,045 --> 00:04:24,045
I thought you were all talk.

47
00:04:24,125 --> 00:04:25,365
Actions speak louder than words.

48
00:04:28,285 --> 00:04:29,125
Sorry to be rude,

49
00:04:29,405 --> 00:04:32,245
but my mind is jumping all over the place.

50
00:04:32,325 --> 00:04:34,005
I'm just putting two and two together.

51
00:04:36,005 --> 00:04:36,845
Feifei...

52
00:04:38,525 --> 00:04:41,165
isn't our house rental contract
ending soon?

53
00:04:41,805 --> 00:04:42,965
Don't bring that up.

54
00:04:43,045 --> 00:04:45,845
The landlord wants me to move out early
in order to sell the place.

55
00:04:46,205 --> 00:04:49,445
I was busy writing so I haven't
started looking for a new place yet.

56
00:04:49,925 --> 00:04:51,205
Move in with me then.

57
00:04:54,525 --> 00:04:55,565
Would that be OK?

58
00:04:56,805 --> 00:04:57,685
I'll let you decide.

59
00:05:04,965 --> 00:05:07,205
Miss Jia, if it suits you,

60
00:05:07,285 --> 00:05:08,965
you could move in with me first.

61
00:05:09,885 --> 00:05:11,285
<i>Wow, I'm impressed.</i>

62
00:05:11,645 --> 00:05:13,525
<i>He's sacrificing himself for love.</i>

63
00:05:13,845 --> 00:05:16,045
Yes, Wen Li takes good care of people.

64
00:05:17,045 --> 00:05:18,645
She doesn't need to live with a man.

65
00:05:19,765 --> 00:05:22,685
That's alright. I need someone
to take care of me anyway.

66
00:05:23,645 --> 00:05:26,165
Mr. Wen, I hope we'll get along
as roommates.

67
00:05:41,005 --> 00:05:42,085
Hello, Lisa.

68
00:05:42,965 --> 00:05:45,365
<i>I got you a role in</i> Frosty Moon.

69
00:05:45,445 --> 00:05:47,805
<i>It's a small supporting role,</i>
<i>but I think you'll like it.</i>

70
00:05:47,885 --> 00:05:49,045
<i>I mailed you the script.</i>

71
00:05:49,605 --> 00:05:51,645
Thanks, Lisa. I'll do my best.

72
00:05:52,405 --> 00:05:54,245
When does filming start?

73
00:05:54,645 --> 00:05:56,085
The main actors start in two days.

74
00:05:56,365 --> 00:05:57,525
They'll contact you about it.

75
00:05:58,085 --> 00:06:00,245
Could I start in two days as well?

76
00:06:00,525 --> 00:06:02,885
I want to get used
to the environment there before filming.

77
00:06:03,445 --> 00:06:04,965
<i>I'll ask the producers then.</i>

78
00:06:15,005 --> 00:06:17,445
You got some work?

79
00:06:18,805 --> 00:06:21,645
I just got the call.
I go on set in two days.

80
00:06:21,725 --> 00:06:22,765
I heard that.

81
00:06:25,005 --> 00:06:26,565
Are you trying to avoid me?

82
00:06:27,845 --> 00:06:30,645
I think we should be separated
from each other for a while.

83
00:06:31,405 --> 00:06:32,245
Why?

84
00:06:32,845 --> 00:06:34,045
Our contract stipulates

85
00:06:34,125 --> 00:06:37,765
that both parties shall not infringe upon
the other's work or private life.

86
00:06:40,885 --> 00:06:42,565
Didn't you declare that

87
00:06:43,005 --> 00:06:44,765
the dog would go wherever you go?

88
00:06:44,845 --> 00:06:45,685
Now you're leaving.

89
00:06:46,245 --> 00:06:48,525
His owner just happens to be coming
to pick it up tonight.

90
00:06:48,605 --> 00:06:49,645
Just in time.

91
00:06:52,285 --> 00:06:53,205
Do whatever you want.

92
00:07:00,925 --> 00:07:03,685
It's getting late. Where is he?

93
00:07:04,805 --> 00:07:06,485
I hope he didn't forget about you.

94
00:07:15,165 --> 00:07:16,525
Hello, this is Xia Lin.

95
00:07:16,605 --> 00:07:17,965
<i>When are you coming to get Eleven?</i>

96
00:07:18,045 --> 00:07:20,485
I'm sorry. I can't pick him up today.

97
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:21,405
Is tomorrow OK?

98
00:07:22,445 --> 00:07:24,445
I'm going somewhere tomorrow.

99
00:07:24,525 --> 00:07:25,525
How about this?

100
00:07:25,605 --> 00:07:28,165
Give me your address.
I'll drop him off for you.

101
00:07:28,565 --> 00:07:29,885
If it's not too much trouble.

102
00:07:30,485 --> 00:07:31,325
<i>No problem.</i>

103
00:07:40,005 --> 00:07:40,845
Let's go.

104
00:07:42,085 --> 00:07:42,925
Come on.

105
00:08:02,165 --> 00:08:04,005
-You?
-The tie lady?

106
00:08:04,405 --> 00:08:07,245
That's right. I didn't know we lived
in the same neighborhood.

107
00:08:08,245 --> 00:08:09,325
And you found my dog.

108
00:08:09,885 --> 00:08:11,165
What a huge coincidence.

109
00:08:11,245 --> 00:08:12,605
-Want to come in?
-No, thanks.

110
00:08:12,685 --> 00:08:14,285
I'm glad Eleven is home now.

111
00:08:15,645 --> 00:08:16,965
You did me such a big favor,

112
00:08:17,045 --> 00:08:19,325
I'd feel rude if I didn't offer you
a glass of water.

113
00:08:21,925 --> 00:08:22,805
Thank you then.

114
00:08:40,525 --> 00:08:41,365
Have a seat.

115
00:08:43,765 --> 00:08:45,285
Your house is beautiful.

116
00:08:47,125 --> 00:08:48,564
Thank you so much for everything.

117
00:08:49,765 --> 00:08:51,205
I must have caused you trouble.

118
00:08:51,285 --> 00:08:52,405
Not at all.

119
00:08:52,725 --> 00:08:55,405
It's just that someone
in my house doesn't like pets.

120
00:08:55,805 --> 00:08:56,765
Are you fighting?

121
00:08:57,285 --> 00:08:58,685
It's fine. He agreed to it.

122
00:09:00,725 --> 00:09:01,645
I understand.

123
00:09:02,445 --> 00:09:03,565
I didn't want a dog at first.

124
00:09:04,365 --> 00:09:05,205
Why?

125
00:09:05,965 --> 00:09:07,805
Because dogs don't live as long as humans,

126
00:09:08,645 --> 00:09:10,125
so they'll always leave us first.

127
00:09:11,165 --> 00:09:12,485
But later on, I realized that

128
00:09:12,965 --> 00:09:16,765
in the whole world, the animal
that's best at desertion is mankind.

129
00:09:17,765 --> 00:09:19,485
They abandon their lovers...

130
00:09:20,485 --> 00:09:23,845
their family, and even their own children.

131
00:09:25,925 --> 00:09:29,405
Maybe sometimes they have no other option.

132
00:09:30,925 --> 00:09:31,965
Perhaps.

133
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:34,605
So, if you don't want to be abandoned,

134
00:09:34,965 --> 00:09:37,005
you have to take your fate
into your own hands.

135
00:09:38,605 --> 00:09:39,765
That way, everything in life

136
00:09:40,525 --> 00:09:42,365
will happen according to plan.

137
00:09:51,245 --> 00:09:52,085
What's wrong?

138
00:09:52,765 --> 00:09:55,965
It seems like you have
a lot of stories to tell.

139
00:09:57,245 --> 00:09:58,805
I've been through more than most.

140
00:10:01,685 --> 00:10:03,405
What's wrong? Are you sick?

141
00:10:04,005 --> 00:10:04,925
I have a slight fever.

142
00:10:05,365 --> 00:10:06,645
I slept all day.

143
00:10:07,005 --> 00:10:08,605
That's why I forgot to pick up Eleven.

144
00:10:08,685 --> 00:10:11,125
Did you eat anything?

145
00:10:13,685 --> 00:10:14,965
I'm too weak to cook.

146
00:10:15,925 --> 00:10:17,725
What about your friends and family?

147
00:10:18,405 --> 00:10:19,885
There's no one to take care of you?

148
00:10:19,965 --> 00:10:20,885
They're all abroad.

149
00:10:21,765 --> 00:10:25,005
You could have something delivered.
You really should eat when you're sick.

150
00:10:26,365 --> 00:10:27,925
I don't like restaurant food.

151
00:10:30,725 --> 00:10:31,685
Where's your kitchen?

152
00:10:33,685 --> 00:10:34,725
Over there.

153
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:36,925
Why are you asking?

154
00:10:37,525 --> 00:10:38,965
I have to take care of you.

155
00:10:39,045 --> 00:10:41,445
After all, you let me
have that tie last time.

156
00:10:43,805 --> 00:10:45,525
I still don't know your name though.

157
00:10:47,365 --> 00:10:48,485
You can call me Nan.

158
00:10:49,525 --> 00:10:51,645
Alright, then. You get some rest.

159
00:10:51,725 --> 00:10:53,125
I'll call you when it's ready.

160
00:10:53,205 --> 00:10:54,645
-Go and rest.
-Thank you.

161
00:11:43,645 --> 00:11:45,565
<i>Nan, I'm heading home.</i>

162
00:11:45,925 --> 00:11:47,365
<i>Make sure you finish the congee.</i>

163
00:11:47,645 --> 00:11:49,965
<i>Heat it up if it's cold.</i>

164
00:12:13,405 --> 00:12:15,885
What's up? You want some, too?

165
00:13:02,885 --> 00:13:05,045
-I thought you'd already left.
-I was late.

166
00:13:08,125 --> 00:13:09,685
We're not going the same way.

167
00:13:09,765 --> 00:13:12,445
It's fine. I'm already late anyway.

168
00:13:13,445 --> 00:13:14,285
Get in.

169
00:13:30,085 --> 00:13:31,565
If you're going to miss me,

170
00:13:32,125 --> 00:13:33,525
we can just head back now.

171
00:13:35,845 --> 00:13:37,205
You're not mad anymore?

172
00:13:37,685 --> 00:13:39,165
Do I seem that petty?

173
00:13:39,765 --> 00:13:41,325
You don't seem petty. You are petty.

174
00:13:42,125 --> 00:13:45,245
If that's what you think,
then I need to live up to my reputation.

175
00:13:45,965 --> 00:13:46,805
What do you mean?

176
00:13:47,925 --> 00:13:48,965
When you get there,

177
00:13:49,445 --> 00:13:51,125
don't talk to men you don't know.

178
00:13:51,685 --> 00:13:53,605
No sex scenes or kissing scenes.

179
00:13:53,685 --> 00:13:54,925
No revealing clothing.

180
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:58,605
How do you define "revealing"?

181
00:13:59,165 --> 00:14:00,725
No showing your collarbones.

182
00:14:00,805 --> 00:14:02,045
No showing your belly button.

183
00:14:02,125 --> 00:14:03,565
Skirts must be at least knee-length.

184
00:14:04,645 --> 00:14:05,845
You have a lot of rules.

185
00:14:06,125 --> 00:14:07,845
Mr. Ling, this isn't even a real marriage.

186
00:14:09,405 --> 00:14:11,045
I take my marriage very seriously.

187
00:14:11,765 --> 00:14:14,805
Fine. That's enough.
I'll do what you said.

188
00:14:18,805 --> 00:14:19,685
Where's your ring?

189
00:14:26,205 --> 00:14:28,125
I always have it on me.

190
00:14:31,805 --> 00:14:32,645
What are you doing?

191
00:14:37,605 --> 00:14:40,445
Rings are supposed to be worn.

192
00:14:40,925 --> 00:14:43,885
But I can't wear it when I'm filming.

193
00:14:44,285 --> 00:14:45,525
Try taking it off then.

194
00:14:50,725 --> 00:14:53,485
We'll be so far apart.
You won't be able to see me anyway.

195
00:14:53,885 --> 00:14:55,005
Try and see what happens.

196
00:15:04,445 --> 00:15:06,485
Stop. I can get off right here.

197
00:15:10,845 --> 00:15:12,165
I've got to go. Bye.

198
00:15:13,405 --> 00:15:15,165
That's how you say goodbye
to your husband?

199
00:15:22,765 --> 00:15:24,125
Call me once you arrive.

200
00:15:26,805 --> 00:15:27,645
OK.

201
00:15:29,925 --> 00:15:31,485
I really need to get going.

202
00:15:36,165 --> 00:15:39,005
I've got to go. Bye.

203
00:16:03,645 --> 00:16:06,845
Mr. Ling, the show she's doing
is produced by Xing An Entertainment.

204
00:16:07,165 --> 00:16:09,685
If you're worried,
you can have Miss An look after her.

205
00:16:09,765 --> 00:16:10,605
No need for that.

206
00:16:11,085 --> 00:16:12,445
Isn't Chu Yan filming there, too?

207
00:16:12,845 --> 00:16:13,845
That's right.

208
00:16:14,365 --> 00:16:15,965
-Head back to the office.
-OK.

209
00:16:22,845 --> 00:16:25,045
Linlin, what brings you here?

210
00:16:25,125 --> 00:16:26,405
I'm acting in a show.

211
00:16:26,925 --> 00:16:28,005
Why are you here?

212
00:16:28,085 --> 00:16:29,205
Let me introduce you.

213
00:16:29,285 --> 00:16:31,525
This is Lu Di.
He's one of Xing An's actors.

214
00:16:31,605 --> 00:16:34,645
This is Xia Lin.
She's my best female friend in China.

215
00:16:36,565 --> 00:16:38,365
Is Ms. Xia also acting in <i>Frosty Moon</i>?

216
00:16:39,685 --> 00:16:41,085
I'm one of the supporting roles.

217
00:16:41,165 --> 00:16:43,765
I've always wanted you
to act in one of our company's films.

218
00:16:43,845 --> 00:16:45,525
I'm so glad it happened so soon.

219
00:16:45,805 --> 00:16:48,165
If you ever need anything
when we're filming,

220
00:16:48,245 --> 00:16:50,325
come to him. He'll do whatever you ask.

221
00:16:50,845 --> 00:16:52,325
It would be my honor to help you.

222
00:16:52,725 --> 00:16:53,805
Thank you, Mr. Lu.

223
00:16:54,365 --> 00:16:55,805
An Ran, I'm going to head upstairs.

224
00:16:56,285 --> 00:16:57,605
-Bye.
-Bye.

225
00:17:02,205 --> 00:17:03,045
Miss An.

226
00:17:03,525 --> 00:17:06,605
If you two are friends, why do you want
the media to spread rumors about us?

227
00:17:07,205 --> 00:17:09,285
Just do whatever I tell you to do.

228
00:17:09,885 --> 00:17:11,725
Everything else is none of your business.

229
00:17:21,965 --> 00:17:23,005
Anything else?

230
00:17:23,765 --> 00:17:27,925
Over the past two months,
a lot of important R&amp;D employees have quit

231
00:17:28,525 --> 00:17:29,885
to go and work somewhere else.

232
00:17:30,445 --> 00:17:32,124
Carry out an internal investigation first.

233
00:17:32,205 --> 00:17:33,485
If there aren't any issues,

234
00:17:33,805 --> 00:17:38,245
I remember that our contract includes
a non-compete clause, right?

235
00:17:38,325 --> 00:17:39,285
That's right.

236
00:17:39,365 --> 00:17:41,125
Look into the companies they switch to.

237
00:17:42,205 --> 00:17:46,365
If they're our competitors,
press charges for breach of contract.

238
00:17:46,885 --> 00:17:47,725
Got it.

239
00:17:48,045 --> 00:17:51,805
People might start making assumptions
about why our employees are leaving.

240
00:17:52,685 --> 00:17:55,725
Notify everyone that we start
employee evaluations today.

241
00:17:55,805 --> 00:17:57,525
Those not up to par will be fired.

242
00:17:57,805 --> 00:18:00,525
Old and new employees
will be treated the same.

243
00:18:00,925 --> 00:18:01,765
Yes, sir.

244
00:18:02,765 --> 00:18:03,605
Wait.

245
00:18:05,885 --> 00:18:06,885
Women...

246
00:18:08,605 --> 00:18:10,485
What do they like?

247
00:18:12,525 --> 00:18:15,045
Mr. Ling, are you thinking
about what to get your wife?

248
00:18:17,325 --> 00:18:20,445
I don't really have female friends, so...

249
00:18:20,885 --> 00:18:22,325
You seem to know Jia Fei well.

250
00:18:33,485 --> 00:18:34,885
Just what do they like?

251
00:18:36,485 --> 00:18:39,405
Why are you here?
It's not time to move yet.

252
00:18:41,205 --> 00:18:43,205
Sorry. I couldn't reach you on your phone,

253
00:18:43,285 --> 00:18:44,605
so I had to come here.

254
00:18:45,405 --> 00:18:46,325
Is Linlin in trouble?

255
00:18:46,645 --> 00:18:49,165
No. Mr. Ling wants to know what she likes.

256
00:18:52,365 --> 00:18:54,485
Mr. Ling really does spare no effort

257
00:18:54,565 --> 00:18:56,725
when it comes to maintaining peace
in the relationship.

258
00:18:57,885 --> 00:18:59,245
He's always been very attentive.

259
00:19:07,045 --> 00:19:08,405
Don't worry, Miss Jia.

260
00:19:08,485 --> 00:19:10,605
Mrs. Ling won't hear
about our conversation today.

261
00:19:11,285 --> 00:19:13,605
I'm not worried about that.

262
00:19:14,685 --> 00:19:17,085
Mr. Wen, you're an elite assistant.

263
00:19:18,005 --> 00:19:21,125
Don't you think helping Mr. Ling
with this matter is below you?

264
00:19:24,445 --> 00:19:25,965
It's my honor to help my boss.

265
00:19:28,605 --> 00:19:31,125
I can help you and Mr. Ling,

266
00:19:31,485 --> 00:19:33,445
but one thing you should know about me

267
00:19:33,525 --> 00:19:36,005
-is that I don't help people out for free.
-Don't worry.

268
00:19:36,405 --> 00:19:39,925
If you provide information,
you'll get a DVD signed by Director Cai.

269
00:19:40,285 --> 00:19:41,165
Deal.

270
00:19:41,685 --> 00:19:43,205
Diamonds are a woman's best friend,

271
00:19:43,285 --> 00:19:45,445
but your wife is no ordinary woman.

272
00:19:47,125 --> 00:19:48,565
To break this emotional gridlock,

273
00:19:48,925 --> 00:19:52,405
it's imperative that both parties
start to connect emotionally.

274
00:19:52,765 --> 00:19:53,765
Just tell me the plan.

275
00:19:54,645 --> 00:19:56,645
For example, you could get a pet.

276
00:19:57,125 --> 00:19:58,885
Your wife seems to like dogs very much.

277
00:20:00,925 --> 00:20:01,805
I think that...

278
00:20:04,285 --> 00:20:05,485
you can go home now.

279
00:20:06,605 --> 00:20:09,645
Mr. Ling, are you going
to work late every day

280
00:20:09,725 --> 00:20:11,205
while your wife is filming?

281
00:20:11,645 --> 00:20:12,485
Yes.

282
00:20:14,085 --> 00:20:15,645
I must earn money to support Mumu.

283
00:20:17,125 --> 00:20:20,365
Single men like you
could never understand.

284
00:20:38,525 --> 00:20:39,845
Why are you here?

285
00:20:40,205 --> 00:20:41,845
Mr. Lu, can I help you?

286
00:20:42,925 --> 00:20:45,085
Are you ready
for our scene together tomorrow?

287
00:20:45,765 --> 00:20:48,365
I'll be ready for it.
I don't want to cause you trouble.

288
00:20:48,965 --> 00:20:51,445
I just happen to have some time.
Let's practice.

289
00:20:52,365 --> 00:20:55,125
There are mosquitos out here.
How about we go back inside?

290
00:20:55,205 --> 00:20:56,205
It's quieter out here.

291
00:20:56,485 --> 00:20:58,245
-I don't like crowded places.
-Mr. Lu.

292
00:20:58,645 --> 00:21:01,085
It's almost time for lunch.
I don't want to take up your time.

293
00:21:01,685 --> 00:21:03,565
I promised Miss An
that I'd look after you.

294
00:21:03,645 --> 00:21:04,645
I have to keep my word.

295
00:21:07,765 --> 00:21:09,605
What are you two doing out here?

296
00:21:10,645 --> 00:21:11,605
Mr. Chu.

297
00:21:11,685 --> 00:21:12,965
Why are you here?

298
00:21:13,565 --> 00:21:14,845
Just happened to stop by?

299
00:21:14,925 --> 00:21:17,685
No, I came to see someone.

300
00:21:19,205 --> 00:21:20,485
You two know each other?

301
00:21:22,125 --> 00:21:24,085
We don't just know each other.

302
00:21:24,165 --> 00:21:26,085
We actually often read scripts together.

303
00:21:28,605 --> 00:21:30,805
I'll get going now, Mr. Lu.
See you in a bit.

304
00:21:31,205 --> 00:21:32,405
-Bye.
-Alright, then.

305
00:21:34,085 --> 00:21:35,085
But...

306
00:21:39,205 --> 00:21:40,245
Miss An.

307
00:21:40,645 --> 00:21:43,245
I didn't get a photo.

308
00:21:44,725 --> 00:21:46,245
Chu Yan showed up and took her away.

309
00:21:46,765 --> 00:21:49,245
<i>Chu Yan? Why would he show up?</i>

310
00:21:50,845 --> 00:21:53,045
<i>Keep an eye on them for me.</i>

311
00:21:53,405 --> 00:21:55,805
Who on earth is this Xia Lin girl?

312
00:21:56,885 --> 00:21:59,245
I have to know who I'll be offending.

313
00:21:59,325 --> 00:22:00,685
<i>All you need to know is that</i>

314
00:22:01,005 --> 00:22:02,525
<i>if you don't do your job,</i>

315
00:22:03,045 --> 00:22:05,845
<i>you'll be offending everyone</i>
<i>at Xing An Entertainment.</i>

316
00:22:05,925 --> 00:22:07,205
Got it. Alright.

317
00:22:07,285 --> 00:22:08,685
OK. Goodbye.

318
00:22:13,485 --> 00:22:15,205
When have we ever read a script together?

319
00:22:17,685 --> 00:22:18,965
Why are you here?

320
00:22:19,045 --> 00:22:20,365
Someone asked me

321
00:22:20,845 --> 00:22:24,085
to deliver a bunch of medicine
and nutrition supplements to your hotel.

322
00:22:25,845 --> 00:22:28,645
How's life as Mrs. Ling going?

323
00:22:29,645 --> 00:22:30,485
Great.

324
00:22:31,165 --> 00:22:32,725
Everyone has been very nice to me.

325
00:22:33,965 --> 00:22:37,245
Perhaps too nice.
Why was he trying to hug you?

326
00:22:38,525 --> 00:22:40,885
I don't know why
he thought he could do that.

327
00:22:41,445 --> 00:22:43,125
Thanks for getting me out of there.

328
00:22:43,605 --> 00:22:46,445
I wasn't helping you.
I was saving Ling from embarrassment.

329
00:22:46,925 --> 00:22:49,125
Nobody knows about Yizhou and I.

330
00:22:50,005 --> 00:22:51,685
If they knew you were Mrs. Ling,

331
00:22:52,085 --> 00:22:53,045
they'd never do that.

332
00:22:53,725 --> 00:22:56,205
Don't you dare tell anyone
about our marriage.

333
00:22:56,965 --> 00:22:57,805
Why?

334
00:22:59,205 --> 00:23:00,685
We agreed to keep it secret.

335
00:23:01,085 --> 00:23:04,525
Just act like you didn't see anything.
Don't tell him, OK?

336
00:23:08,445 --> 00:23:09,565
I'll take that as a "yes."

337
00:23:10,245 --> 00:23:12,685
Those people are all from our set.
You should get going.

338
00:23:14,365 --> 00:23:16,325
I'm warning you,
stay away from that Lu Di.

339
00:23:16,405 --> 00:23:17,445
Or else I'll tell Yizhou.

340
00:23:18,085 --> 00:23:20,045
Fine, you snitch.

341
00:23:53,005 --> 00:23:55,485
I know that the Chu family
has given me everything I have.

342
00:23:55,565 --> 00:23:58,645
But that doesn't mean you can
have me marry someone to benefit yourself.

343
00:23:59,165 --> 00:24:00,005
I know.

344
00:24:00,445 --> 00:24:01,885
I'm just an orphan you adopted.

345
00:24:02,325 --> 00:24:04,005
You don't need to remind me of that.

346
00:24:21,885 --> 00:24:22,925
When did you get here?

347
00:24:24,805 --> 00:24:27,085
Before you hung up the phone.

348
00:24:29,485 --> 00:24:30,965
Do you enjoy eavesdropping?

349
00:24:31,485 --> 00:24:33,885
You love finding out
other people's secrets, don't you?

350
00:24:33,965 --> 00:24:36,405
I'm sorry.
I just wanted to give you an umbrella.

351
00:24:37,085 --> 00:24:37,925
Don't worry.

352
00:24:38,285 --> 00:24:40,125
-I won't say a word.
-Just stop.

353
00:24:40,565 --> 00:24:43,445
I don't need to be pitied
by someone like you.

354
00:24:45,885 --> 00:24:47,085
Who's pitying you?

355
00:24:47,405 --> 00:24:48,885
You don't deserve pity at all.

356
00:24:49,605 --> 00:24:52,725
You're handsome. You have a great body.
You won Best Actor at such a young age.

357
00:24:52,805 --> 00:24:54,165
You have over 50 million fans.

358
00:24:54,245 --> 00:24:56,205
When you post,
you get thousands of comments.

359
00:24:56,605 --> 00:24:58,045
You have a sports car and a mansion.

360
00:24:58,125 --> 00:24:59,845
There's always gossip about another girl.

361
00:24:59,925 --> 00:25:02,365
You have what most people
will never achieve in a lifetime.

362
00:25:02,445 --> 00:25:03,805
What more could you possibly want?

363
00:25:03,885 --> 00:25:06,365
You can't go this far
just because you know my secret.

364
00:25:08,285 --> 00:25:11,205
I just hate seeing you whine all the time.

365
00:25:11,605 --> 00:25:13,205
It's not like the entire world owes you.

366
00:25:14,365 --> 00:25:15,685
You have the right to despise me?

367
00:25:16,405 --> 00:25:17,965
Who do you think you are?

368
00:25:19,205 --> 00:25:21,205
You're like those girls
who sleep around to move up.

369
00:25:22,085 --> 00:25:24,325
Ling helped you deal
with the dress problem.

370
00:25:24,925 --> 00:25:27,725
You won't even admit that
you approached Yizhou just to use him.

371
00:25:28,285 --> 00:25:31,285
My relationship with Ling Yizhou
is none of your business.

372
00:25:46,525 --> 00:25:49,445
I didn't want to find out
about his secret. He's so mean.

373
00:25:51,805 --> 00:25:53,485
I shouldn't have given him that umbrella.

374
00:25:53,925 --> 00:25:56,445
I should have let him get rained on
and have an asthma attack.

375
00:26:06,845 --> 00:26:08,205
-You're here.
-Mr. Lu.

376
00:26:09,405 --> 00:26:11,085
I thought this was a cast and crew event.

377
00:26:11,725 --> 00:26:12,805
Where's everyone else?

378
00:26:12,885 --> 00:26:14,125
I only said that so you'd come.

379
00:26:14,765 --> 00:26:17,805
So, only the two of us
are going to be here?

380
00:26:17,885 --> 00:26:18,725
That's right.

381
00:26:18,805 --> 00:26:21,285
I think the two of us
should have a nice long chat.

382
00:26:22,285 --> 00:26:23,525
I need to go to the restroom.

383
00:26:23,605 --> 00:26:24,565
No, stay here.

384
00:26:35,525 --> 00:26:36,725
A meal for forgiveness?

385
00:26:38,125 --> 00:26:39,005
So unoriginal.

386
00:26:43,285 --> 00:26:44,125
Here.

387
00:26:45,085 --> 00:26:47,005
To our first time working together.

388
00:26:47,405 --> 00:26:48,245
Cheers.

389
00:26:48,325 --> 00:26:50,525
I'm sorry, Mr. Lu. I don't drink alcohol.

390
00:26:51,645 --> 00:26:55,245
Everyone drinks alcohol.
Some people are better at it than others.

391
00:26:55,325 --> 00:26:56,925
I really don't drink.

392
00:26:57,005 --> 00:26:59,765
-Here you go.
-No, I really can't.

393
00:26:59,845 --> 00:27:01,565
-I never drink.
-Just try a sip.

394
00:27:01,645 --> 00:27:03,685
-I don't drink, Mr. Lu.
-Just one sip.

395
00:27:12,445 --> 00:27:14,725
Are you stupid?
He told you to stay, so you stayed?

396
00:27:15,085 --> 00:27:16,885
We're filming a moving together.

397
00:27:16,965 --> 00:27:18,965
I don't want to make things awkward.

398
00:27:19,485 --> 00:27:20,605
What if I hadn't shown up?

399
00:27:21,205 --> 00:27:23,405
How dare you not come
after all the nasty things you said?

400
00:27:25,685 --> 00:27:27,965
Fine. I was in a bad mood this afternoon.

401
00:27:28,885 --> 00:27:32,045
But I just rescued you. So we're even now.

402
00:27:33,245 --> 00:27:35,085
Was that an apology?

403
00:27:36,205 --> 00:27:38,565
I wouldn't say that. I'd say...

404
00:27:39,605 --> 00:27:40,885
it's reconciling.

405
00:27:40,965 --> 00:27:42,565
Why would I want to reconcile with you?

406
00:27:45,125 --> 00:27:47,325
Fine. I'll apologize then.

407
00:27:47,805 --> 00:27:50,125
We started arguing because of Ling.

408
00:27:50,565 --> 00:27:52,725
Think of it as forgiving me for him.

409
00:27:54,205 --> 00:27:56,805
It has nothing to do with him.
It's because I'm generous.

410
00:28:02,925 --> 00:28:04,565
Stop treating me like a three-year-old.

411
00:28:04,645 --> 00:28:06,845
You'd be a two-year-old.

412
00:28:08,925 --> 00:28:11,125
Alright. We're good now.

413
00:28:25,885 --> 00:28:27,845
<i>Ling, I saw your wife today.</i>

414
00:28:27,925 --> 00:28:28,765
<i>Is she doing OK?</i>

415
00:28:29,285 --> 00:28:31,965
Not really. I think someone's trying
to make a move on her.

416
00:28:44,525 --> 00:28:46,325
Who left you here?

417
00:28:51,965 --> 00:28:52,965
Pick a name for it.

418
00:28:55,645 --> 00:28:57,165
You bought me a dog?

419
00:28:58,085 --> 00:29:00,005
You're not going to invite me in?

420
00:29:05,445 --> 00:29:06,325
Hurry up. Quick.

421
00:29:06,685 --> 00:29:07,845
Come in. Hurry up.

422
00:29:19,485 --> 00:29:21,125
Why are you acting all mysterious?

423
00:29:21,205 --> 00:29:23,045
We're legally married,
not having an affair.

424
00:29:25,885 --> 00:29:26,725
Let's call it Pidan.

425
00:29:28,725 --> 00:29:29,805
Whatever you want.

426
00:29:31,245 --> 00:29:32,925
So, why are you here?

427
00:29:34,765 --> 00:29:36,765
I wanted to help you relax.

428
00:29:37,365 --> 00:29:39,005
I'm really busy though.

429
00:29:39,085 --> 00:29:41,565
We're filming my main scenes.
I don't have any free time.

430
00:29:50,965 --> 00:29:54,205
"Due to the set
suddenly being unavailable,

431
00:29:54,925 --> 00:29:57,085
cast and crew get two days off."

432
00:29:57,325 --> 00:30:00,725
All cast and crew must return
by tomorrow night.

433
00:30:02,805 --> 00:30:03,965
You came at the right time.

434
00:30:06,485 --> 00:30:09,445
Some coincidences are planned.

435
00:30:33,805 --> 00:30:34,645
Let's go in.

436
00:30:38,525 --> 00:30:41,005
If something's bothering you, tell me.
Don't hold it inside.

437
00:30:42,005 --> 00:30:43,005
Secrets make you ugly.

438
00:30:43,365 --> 00:30:45,925
Didn't we agree not to interfere
with each other's work?

439
00:30:46,245 --> 00:30:47,885
Don't you know how big of a hit

440
00:30:48,445 --> 00:30:51,045
production will take because
you made our set unavailable?

441
00:30:51,925 --> 00:30:55,845
We could wait for my break
to come on this trip.

442
00:30:56,565 --> 00:30:59,285
That would be true
if nobody was trying to harass you.

443
00:31:00,525 --> 00:31:02,685
Chu Yan, you snitch.

444
00:31:03,405 --> 00:31:05,925
Mumu, we have a crisis of trust right now.

445
00:31:06,525 --> 00:31:09,165
You didn't tell me about
what happened right away.

446
00:31:09,685 --> 00:31:11,165
And you didn't tell me later.

447
00:31:11,845 --> 00:31:14,205
Is it because you think
it has nothing to do with me?

448
00:31:14,285 --> 00:31:15,845
Nothing really happened.

449
00:31:15,925 --> 00:31:17,405
It would be too late if it had.

450
00:31:20,685 --> 00:31:21,605
That's enough for now.

451
00:31:22,165 --> 00:31:23,045
Let's go inside.

452
00:31:23,525 --> 00:31:24,565
Come a little closer.

453
00:31:29,165 --> 00:31:30,285
Welcome, Director Ling.

454
00:31:33,605 --> 00:31:35,925
How does he know you?
I thought you're always low-key?

455
00:31:36,605 --> 00:31:38,805
The owner is a Lingshi Group shareholder.
It's fine.

456
00:31:39,805 --> 00:31:42,605
Hello, Miss Xia.
I'm in charge of this guesthouse.

457
00:31:42,685 --> 00:31:43,845
My name is Mr. Wang.

458
00:31:43,925 --> 00:31:45,485
I'm glad to be of your service.

459
00:31:46,525 --> 00:31:47,845
This is a personal visit.

460
00:31:47,925 --> 00:31:49,205
-Treat us as normal guests.
-OK.

461
00:31:49,645 --> 00:31:52,005
Mr. Ling, you requested
a luxury room with a king-size bed.

462
00:31:52,085 --> 00:31:53,485
The room is ready for you now.

463
00:31:54,405 --> 00:31:56,645
Only one room?

464
00:31:57,805 --> 00:31:59,565
When I called,
there was only one room left.

465
00:32:00,125 --> 00:32:01,365
That's right.

466
00:32:02,445 --> 00:32:05,045
Are there any other
vacant rooms right now?

467
00:32:06,085 --> 00:32:07,885
-Let me take a look.
-Excuse me...

468
00:32:07,965 --> 00:32:10,925
Yang has only been
working here for two days.

469
00:32:11,005 --> 00:32:12,005
She's still learning.

470
00:32:12,445 --> 00:32:15,725
It's peak travel season now.
All our rooms are reserved.

471
00:32:17,085 --> 00:32:19,205
What about other room types?

472
00:32:19,285 --> 00:32:20,245
Everything's booked.

473
00:32:22,085 --> 00:32:24,285
Mumu, if you insist,

474
00:32:24,605 --> 00:32:27,365
we can see if any other guest
is willing to give up their room.

475
00:32:28,445 --> 00:32:29,485
No need for that.

476
00:32:29,565 --> 00:32:31,085
That's too much trouble.

477
00:32:31,165 --> 00:32:32,525
Yang, get me the room key. Hurry.

478
00:32:34,085 --> 00:32:35,285
Sorry to keep you waiting.

479
00:32:36,325 --> 00:32:37,365
Let's go.

480
00:32:55,405 --> 00:32:57,725
Mumu, did you turn off the light?

481
00:32:58,165 --> 00:32:59,125
Is the power out?

482
00:32:59,965 --> 00:33:01,365
Sorry, I hit the wrong switch.

483
00:33:13,165 --> 00:33:14,005
Not tired yet?

484
00:33:14,845 --> 00:33:15,885
Waiting for me?

485
00:33:17,085 --> 00:33:19,645
I'm not tired yet.
You can go to bed first.

486
00:33:20,525 --> 00:33:21,485
Go take a shower.

487
00:33:24,005 --> 00:33:27,285
I took one before we came out.

488
00:33:32,285 --> 00:33:34,445
OK, then.
I don't care if you shower or not.

489
00:33:47,885 --> 00:33:50,765
Hotel beds are really gross.
You should put on a shirt.

490
00:33:51,285 --> 00:33:52,125
But I'm hot.

491
00:33:52,725 --> 00:33:54,245
I don't know why I feel so hot.

492
00:33:55,485 --> 00:33:56,685
I'll turn on the AC for you.

493
00:33:56,765 --> 00:33:57,805
It's already on.

494
00:33:59,245 --> 00:34:00,245
Then I'll turn on the TV.

495
00:34:02,165 --> 00:34:03,285
We don't need the TV.

496
00:34:04,965 --> 00:34:07,245
It's late. We should go to sleep.

497
00:34:35,285 --> 00:34:37,485
<i>As long as I hold</i>
<i>the last line of defense,</i>

498
00:34:38,285 --> 00:34:40,644
<i>I guess sleeping in the same bed</i>

499
00:34:41,405 --> 00:34:43,605
<i>is pretty much the same</i>
<i>as staying in the same room.</i>

500
00:34:45,565 --> 00:34:49,204
<i>But with a pretty young lady</i>
<i>lying next to him,</i>

501
00:34:49,765 --> 00:34:51,885
<i>what if he can't stop himself from...</i>

502
00:34:52,244 --> 00:34:53,565
<i>doing something?</i>

503
00:34:58,085 --> 00:34:59,325
Can you stop moving around?

504
00:35:01,125 --> 00:35:02,245
You're not asleep yet?

505
00:35:02,645 --> 00:35:04,565
How can I fall asleep
when you keep moving around?

506
00:35:04,925 --> 00:35:06,085
I'm sorry.

507
00:35:08,205 --> 00:35:11,565
Relax. I won't do anything to you.

508
00:35:30,205 --> 00:35:31,245
Ling Yizhou...

509
00:35:32,405 --> 00:35:36,045
what do you think is
most important in a relationship?

510
00:35:45,365 --> 00:35:46,205
What do you think?

511
00:35:50,085 --> 00:35:53,365
I used to think that
loving each other was enough.

512
00:35:54,085 --> 00:35:58,045
Now, I think it's being
completely honest...

513
00:35:59,205 --> 00:36:01,285
and respecting every decision
the other person makes.

514
00:36:02,245 --> 00:36:05,405
That's what it takes
to have a relationship.

515
00:36:12,005 --> 00:36:13,445
What if someone lied to you?

516
00:36:16,725 --> 00:36:20,765
It depends on the situation.

517
00:36:38,445 --> 00:36:39,285
Actually...

518
00:36:42,085 --> 00:36:43,005
I lied to you...

519
00:36:45,885 --> 00:36:46,885
about your illness.

520
00:37:58,805 --> 00:37:59,645
Good morning.

521
00:38:00,205 --> 00:38:01,045
Morning.

522
00:38:02,725 --> 00:38:04,005
I caught you in the act.

523
00:38:04,885 --> 00:38:07,365
-You can't run away now.
-I haven't brushed my teeth.

524
00:38:10,405 --> 00:38:11,245
I don't care.

525
00:38:17,845 --> 00:38:18,805
You'd better pay up.

526
00:38:19,445 --> 00:38:20,285
You understand me?

527
00:38:21,485 --> 00:38:23,245
You need to pay us back today.

528
00:38:25,325 --> 00:38:26,165
Stop!

529
00:38:27,725 --> 00:38:28,565
Get over here!

530
00:38:29,925 --> 00:38:30,765
Pay up!

531
00:38:33,485 --> 00:38:36,005
I'll call the police!
You're causing trouble!

532
00:38:36,085 --> 00:38:38,605
Go away. I don't have any money.

533
00:38:39,125 --> 00:38:41,205
You took everything in our house.

534
00:38:41,485 --> 00:38:42,405
Where's your father?

535
00:38:42,725 --> 00:38:44,045
How dare he owe me money?

536
00:38:44,125 --> 00:38:45,805
He must be trying to get himself killed.

537
00:38:45,885 --> 00:38:48,245
I haven't seen him for a long time.

538
00:38:48,525 --> 00:38:52,005
I'm begging you.
Please don't come back here.

539
00:38:53,005 --> 00:38:55,205
He's your father. If he can't pay up,

540
00:38:55,285 --> 00:38:57,605
we'll take you away instead. Come on.

541
00:38:57,685 --> 00:38:58,925
No! Let go of me!

542
00:38:59,965 --> 00:39:01,285
What are you doing?

543
00:39:01,365 --> 00:39:04,005
Director Ling,
I'm sorry you had to see this.

544
00:39:04,085 --> 00:39:05,245
Who the hell are you?

545
00:39:05,325 --> 00:39:08,325
Watch your language.
He's not someone you can afford to cross.

546
00:39:09,165 --> 00:39:10,445
What do you want?

547
00:39:10,525 --> 00:39:12,205
You want to pay off
the Yang family's debt?

548
00:39:12,605 --> 00:39:14,765
If not, go mind your own business.

549
00:39:15,165 --> 00:39:17,325
-How much do they owe?
-Including interest,130,000RMB.

550
00:39:24,925 --> 00:39:27,925
Take this to Gangdong Tower.
They'll give you the money.

551
00:39:31,365 --> 00:39:32,565
But I'm warning you,

552
00:39:33,285 --> 00:39:35,125
don't you ever come back here...

553
00:39:36,725 --> 00:39:38,285
or I'll make sure you pay for it.

554
00:39:43,365 --> 00:39:45,245
We'll see about that
after we get the money.

555
00:39:45,605 --> 00:39:46,445
Come on.

556
00:39:56,725 --> 00:39:58,805
Let's interview today's hero.

557
00:39:58,885 --> 00:40:01,405
He paid off 130,000RMB of debt
just like that.

558
00:40:02,005 --> 00:40:03,405
It's not them I care about.

559
00:40:03,485 --> 00:40:04,845
I paid for my own peace of mind.

560
00:40:05,245 --> 00:40:06,085
Come on. Let's go.

561
00:40:06,605 --> 00:40:09,325
Shouldn't we wait for them to get
the money? What if they come back?

562
00:40:09,405 --> 00:40:10,885
We'll be in danger once they have it.

563
00:40:11,445 --> 00:40:12,845
-Why?
-Who are they?

564
00:40:13,405 --> 00:40:15,005
Local gangsters? The mafia?

565
00:40:15,525 --> 00:40:16,485
If you were them,

566
00:40:16,965 --> 00:40:19,885
and you saw a rich man
with a beautiful young woman,

567
00:40:19,965 --> 00:40:20,805
what would you do?

568
00:40:21,725 --> 00:40:23,725
Kidnap the lady
and kill her once I get the ransom.

569
00:40:24,725 --> 00:40:25,885
You're right. Let's go.

570
00:40:34,005 --> 00:40:35,005
You...

571
00:40:35,325 --> 00:40:36,405
I just got fired.

572
00:40:36,965 --> 00:40:38,885
It's OK. I'm used to it.

573
00:40:38,965 --> 00:40:42,805
Those loan sharks always come after me
wherever I work.

574
00:40:43,125 --> 00:40:45,285
I never last more than a few days.

575
00:40:52,045 --> 00:40:53,965
I want to pay you back for your kindness.

576
00:40:54,325 --> 00:40:56,165
I'll give you the money someday.

577
00:40:58,165 --> 00:41:01,005
Where do you live? We'll drive you home.

578
00:41:02,645 --> 00:41:03,605
Thanks.

579
00:41:16,165 --> 00:41:17,125
This is your home?

580
00:41:17,925 --> 00:41:18,965
It looks pretty nice.

581
00:41:19,565 --> 00:41:20,605
It's not the house.

582
00:41:20,685 --> 00:41:22,165
It's the small shack in the back.

583
00:41:22,725 --> 00:41:23,645
The shack?

584
00:41:23,725 --> 00:41:25,645
Alright, Tongtong.

585
00:41:26,165 --> 00:41:28,885
Why isn't there anyone around?

586
00:41:29,925 --> 00:41:31,245
They're all out working right now.

587
00:41:32,445 --> 00:41:35,165
You look pretty young.
Do you have any other family members?

588
00:41:37,765 --> 00:41:39,685
My mom died when I was young.

589
00:41:40,085 --> 00:41:42,445
I'm the only one left in my family.

590
00:41:48,085 --> 00:41:49,245
I'll let you decide.

591
00:41:51,205 --> 00:41:53,685
Tongtong, would you like to come with me?

592
00:41:54,925 --> 00:41:57,165
What do you mean, miss?

593
00:41:57,245 --> 00:41:58,965
I travel a lot for my job.

594
00:41:59,285 --> 00:42:00,685
I just happen to need an assistant.

595
00:42:01,325 --> 00:42:02,165
Would you like that?

596
00:42:02,525 --> 00:42:04,245
I'd really like that.

597
00:42:05,045 --> 00:42:06,005
Thank you so much.

598
00:42:24,005 --> 00:42:27,005
Mumu, I need to tell you something
when I get home.

599
00:42:27,605 --> 00:42:29,685
What is it? It sounds important.

600
00:42:30,325 --> 00:42:31,445
<i>I'll tell you when we meet.</i>

601
00:42:31,765 --> 00:42:32,685
OK.

602
00:42:36,125 --> 00:42:37,165
Mr. Lu.

603
00:42:37,485 --> 00:42:39,325
-Why haven't you left yet?
-I just got back.

604
00:42:39,925 --> 00:42:40,965
Where are you going?

605
00:42:41,325 --> 00:42:44,085
Production has been cancelled.
Why would I stay here?

606
00:42:46,845 --> 00:42:48,845
How could it be cancelled?

607
00:42:54,485 --> 00:42:55,405
Hello, Mr. Wen.

608
00:42:55,485 --> 00:42:57,085
<i>Mrs. Ling, Mr. Ling had a car accident.</i>

609
00:42:57,565 --> 00:42:58,485
A car accident?

610
00:43:05,405 --> 00:43:06,365
Yizhou...

611
00:43:09,765 --> 00:43:12,365
I thought you were ignoring me.
About last time--

612
00:43:12,445 --> 00:43:14,685
I asked you here
to talk about <i>Frosty Moon</i>.

613
00:43:15,285 --> 00:43:16,605
Is this about Linlin?

614
00:43:17,005 --> 00:43:19,045
-Don't worry. I'll take good care of her.
-No need.

615
00:43:19,885 --> 00:43:23,365
I'll buy one percent of Xing An shares
to own this show.

616
00:43:24,565 --> 00:43:26,925
You're doing this to help Linlin's career?

617
00:43:27,365 --> 00:43:28,205
No.

618
00:43:29,485 --> 00:43:32,005
I want production
to be cancelled immediately.

619
00:43:33,085 --> 00:43:37,205
One more thing.
That actor in your company, Lu Di.

620
00:43:39,165 --> 00:43:42,085
I don't want to hear
another word about him.

621
00:43:45,725 --> 00:43:46,685
That's all.

622
00:45:26,125 --> 00:45:27,885
Subtitle translation by Luke Deming

623
00:45:28,125 --> 00:45:28,965
You.

624
00:45:29,245 --> 00:45:30,085
Fire her for me.

625
00:45:33,405 --> 00:45:34,365
Right now.

626
00:45:36,165 --> 00:45:39,245
His amnesia might just be
a reaction to shock.

627
00:45:39,325 --> 00:45:42,005
Perhaps he'll be normal by tomorrow.

628
00:45:42,365 --> 00:45:44,485
Before I get my memory back,

629
00:45:44,845 --> 00:45:48,165
I hope we can live independently
and not interfere with each other.

630
00:45:48,445 --> 00:45:50,165
Mr. Ling lost his memory, right?
