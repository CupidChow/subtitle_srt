EPISODE 1

3
00:01:52,725 --> 00:01:56,405
<i>I'm Xia Lin, a star in the making.</i>

4
00:01:56,605 --> 00:01:59,845
<i>I've never got a female lead role.</i>
<i>I don't even have 10,000 fans.</i>

5
00:02:00,085 --> 00:02:02,205
<i>My life is just getting started.</i>

6
00:02:02,765 --> 00:02:04,885
<i>I can't just skip to the end.</i>

7
00:02:05,445 --> 00:02:06,725
<i>That's just not possible.</i>

8
00:02:07,405 --> 00:02:08,725
<i>I'm only 21 years old.</i>

9
00:02:09,285 --> 00:02:10,765
<i>I don't smoke or drink.</i>

10
00:02:11,205 --> 00:02:13,165
<i>I eat healthily and work out regularly.</i>

11
00:02:13,805 --> 00:02:15,285
<i>My family has no health issues.</i>

12
00:02:16,085 --> 00:02:18,245
How on earth could I have leukemia?

13
00:02:19,485 --> 00:02:20,445
Please calm down.

14
00:02:20,885 --> 00:02:23,485
We can't confirm it
until we do a bone marrow exam.

15
00:02:33,645 --> 00:02:34,485
This isn't possible.

16
00:02:35,845 --> 00:02:36,925
I can't be sick.

17
00:02:38,045 --> 00:02:39,205
It's just not possible.

18
00:02:39,285 --> 00:02:41,165
EXAMINATION ROOM 4

19
00:02:41,245 --> 00:02:42,165
This isn't possible.

20
00:02:43,725 --> 00:02:45,445
How can I be sick?

21
00:02:58,725 --> 00:03:02,245
GANGDONG INTERNATIONAL MEDICAL CENTER

00:03:21,285 --> 00:03:23,245
SEVEN HOURS EARLIER

TIANYI MEDIA &amp; CULTURE CO.

24
00:03:29,285 --> 00:03:30,165
Is this my driver?

25
00:03:31,525 --> 00:03:33,085
Yes, I'm at the entrance of Tianyi.

26
00:03:35,565 --> 00:03:37,045
Black car with flashing lights?

27
00:03:37,685 --> 00:03:38,565
Yes. I see you.

28
00:03:46,125 --> 00:03:46,965
What?

29
00:03:52,685 --> 00:03:53,725
Can I help you, miss?

30
00:03:54,325 --> 00:03:55,885
Why did you pick someone else up?

31
00:03:55,965 --> 00:03:57,205
I didn't order a shared ride.

32
00:03:59,285 --> 00:04:00,565
Whatever. It doesn't matter.

33
00:04:00,645 --> 00:04:02,125
Drop me off first. I'm in a rush.

34
00:04:02,805 --> 00:04:03,725
Please scoot over.

35
00:04:10,205 --> 00:04:11,045
Sir?

36
00:04:12,125 --> 00:04:13,645
Are you sure you want to get in?

37
00:04:30,805 --> 00:04:32,125
Lingyun Hotel, please.

38
00:04:39,405 --> 00:04:41,925
Just relax. If you get me there on time,

39
00:04:42,005 --> 00:04:43,245
I won't give you a bad review.

40
00:04:43,805 --> 00:04:45,245
I know how hard your job is.

41
00:04:46,645 --> 00:04:47,645
Right, sir?

42
00:05:18,845 --> 00:05:20,485
CHU YAN CALLING

43
00:05:22,245 --> 00:05:24,485
<i>Ling, weren't you supposed to pick me up?</i>

44
00:05:24,725 --> 00:05:25,685
<i>Where are you?</i>

45
00:05:29,445 --> 00:05:30,965
Something came up. I ran out of time.

46
00:05:31,045 --> 00:05:35,205
I'm on your commercial castings committee.

47
00:05:35,645 --> 00:05:38,725
I turned down
a luxury car company for you.

48
00:05:39,245 --> 00:05:41,205
<i>Now I'm standing on the street alone.</i>

49
00:05:41,285 --> 00:05:43,045
<i>Is your heart made of stone?</i>

50
00:05:43,645 --> 00:05:44,485
You can take a taxi.

51
00:05:46,845 --> 00:05:49,525
<i>Do famous people like me take taxis?</i>

52
00:05:54,925 --> 00:05:56,485
Hello? Hello?

53
00:06:05,405 --> 00:06:06,245
Hurry up!

54
00:06:09,885 --> 00:06:12,925
Have we met somewhere before?

55
00:06:13,325 --> 00:06:14,285
I've seen you before.

56
00:06:17,845 --> 00:06:20,925
Miss, the way you flirt is out of style.

57
00:06:25,245 --> 00:06:28,845
When we feel like
we've seen something before,

58
00:06:29,485 --> 00:06:30,765
it's called déjà vu.

59
00:06:31,805 --> 00:06:33,725
I feel like I've seen you before, too.

60
00:06:34,685 --> 00:06:37,245
Have you watched <i>The Comical Office</i>
or <i>Story of the Moon?</i>

61
00:06:37,765 --> 00:06:39,725
I was in Episode 36,
around the 24th minute.

62
00:06:39,805 --> 00:06:41,405
I was the maid who got poisoned and died.

63
00:06:41,805 --> 00:06:43,085
That show was so popular.

64
00:06:43,165 --> 00:06:46,045
I'm sorry. I don't watch much TV.

65
00:06:57,405 --> 00:06:59,405
-Hello?
-<i>Are you downstairs yet?</i>

66
00:06:59,485 --> 00:07:00,845
<i>I've been waiting for 10 minutes.</i>

67
00:07:02,765 --> 00:07:03,765
Wrong number?

68
00:07:03,845 --> 00:07:06,285
<i>Didn't you request</i>
<i>a ride to Lingyun Hotel?</i>

69
00:07:07,565 --> 00:07:09,765
But I'm already in a car right now.

70
00:07:09,845 --> 00:07:11,525
<i>I'm still outside the entrance of Tianyi.</i>

71
00:07:12,725 --> 00:07:14,725
<i>Hello? Hello?</i>

72
00:07:15,765 --> 00:07:16,605
<i>Ma'am?</i>

73
00:07:17,485 --> 00:07:18,325
<i>Hello?</i>

74
00:07:22,965 --> 00:07:24,845
You're not a cab driver?

75
00:07:27,645 --> 00:07:31,605
This isn't a shared ride?

76
00:07:31,965 --> 00:07:35,885
Did anyone in this car say
it was a shared ride?

77
00:07:36,845 --> 00:07:38,645
I'm so sorry. I got in the wrong car.

78
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:41,045
You can just stop
at the intersection there.

79
00:07:41,285 --> 00:07:42,445
It's OK.

80
00:07:43,765 --> 00:07:45,285
We're going to Lingyun Hotel, too.

81
00:07:45,805 --> 00:07:46,765
What a coincidence.

82
00:07:49,205 --> 00:07:52,085
Sorry about all the trouble.

83
00:08:21,245 --> 00:08:23,005
Thank you for the ride.

84
00:08:23,325 --> 00:08:25,325
I'd be late for casting
if it weren't for you.

85
00:08:25,885 --> 00:08:27,405
-What for?
-A Lingshi Group commercial.

86
00:08:28,805 --> 00:08:29,805
Let's go in.

87
00:08:32,965 --> 00:08:34,005
Hold on.

88
00:08:34,925 --> 00:08:36,165
I think my...

89
00:08:36,245 --> 00:08:39,245
My contact lens fell onto your jacket.

90
00:08:40,085 --> 00:08:41,285
Where is it?

91
00:08:46,085 --> 00:08:47,684
Never mind.

92
00:08:47,765 --> 00:08:49,645
I'm going to be late. Thank you. Bye.

93
00:08:57,405 --> 00:08:58,365
Ling Yizhou!

94
00:09:00,205 --> 00:09:01,285
Who's that woman?

95
00:09:02,085 --> 00:09:03,765
-I don't know.
-You don't know her?

96
00:09:03,845 --> 00:09:05,125
Why was she in your car then?

97
00:09:05,205 --> 00:09:07,165
Why would she get so close to you?

98
00:09:07,725 --> 00:09:10,605
Is that hussy
the reason you didn't pick me up?

99
00:09:12,965 --> 00:09:15,285
Alright, I get it.

100
00:09:16,085 --> 00:09:18,565
Out with the old, in with the new, right?

101
00:09:19,445 --> 00:09:22,765
Women are always
throwing themselves at you.

102
00:09:23,085 --> 00:09:25,565
But don't you worry.
I'll always be by your side.

103
00:09:25,925 --> 00:09:28,885
I'll always keep an eye on you.

104
00:09:29,205 --> 00:09:31,045
-Let go.
-Nope.

105
00:09:32,725 --> 00:09:33,565
Let go.

106
00:09:33,645 --> 00:09:34,565
Nope.

107
00:09:36,245 --> 00:09:37,205
Cut.

108
00:09:38,325 --> 00:09:39,205
So who is she?

109
00:09:40,845 --> 00:09:42,045
She got into the wrong car.

110
00:09:48,045 --> 00:09:48,925
Best Actor, huh?

111
00:09:50,165 --> 00:09:51,005
You are amazing.

112
00:09:54,285 --> 00:09:55,125
Thanks.

113
00:09:57,805 --> 00:09:59,725
Hello, my name is Xia Lin.

114
00:09:59,965 --> 00:10:04,125
I graduated from the film academy
and I'm represented by Tianyi.

115
00:10:05,005 --> 00:10:05,845
Tianyi?

116
00:10:06,445 --> 00:10:07,285
Yes.

117
00:10:07,365 --> 00:10:09,405
Mr. Chu, you two are
from the same company.

118
00:10:10,245 --> 00:10:11,085
Are we?

119
00:10:13,685 --> 00:10:14,925
Then you should watch out.

120
00:10:15,605 --> 00:10:18,205
Tianyi only represents the elite.

121
00:10:22,245 --> 00:10:24,445
Alright, which projects have you been in?

122
00:10:25,325 --> 00:10:28,405
I've only had a few small roles
on TV shows before.

123
00:10:29,125 --> 00:10:33,485
I wanted to hone my basic skills,
so I focused more on school.

124
00:10:33,885 --> 00:10:36,205
I've acted in a lot of plays.

125
00:10:37,365 --> 00:10:38,205
That's great.

126
00:10:38,725 --> 00:10:40,645
Let's see how well
you know the basics then.

127
00:10:43,325 --> 00:10:45,885
Have you seen <i>Flirting Scholar</i>?

128
00:10:46,205 --> 00:10:47,765
Of course, Mr. Chu.

129
00:10:48,445 --> 00:10:51,125
Do you want me to act as Chow Heung?

130
00:10:52,045 --> 00:10:57,645
No, I want you to act
as the stunningly... ugly one.

131
00:11:06,765 --> 00:11:08,645
"Everyone knows you're
secretly in love with me.

132
00:11:08,725 --> 00:11:11,165
How can I live like this? I'd rather die."

133
00:11:11,685 --> 00:11:14,645
"That's not true.
I love you like my mother."

134
00:11:15,765 --> 00:11:17,765
"You're in love with
your own mother? Gosh.

135
00:11:18,285 --> 00:11:20,805
These morally depraved things you do

136
00:11:20,885 --> 00:11:22,205
really turn me on.

137
00:11:23,205 --> 00:11:25,325
I've never tried this before.
I'm a bit nervous.

138
00:11:25,965 --> 00:11:27,605
Come on. Hurry up."

139
00:11:28,205 --> 00:11:29,365
-Stop.
-"Come on."

140
00:11:29,445 --> 00:11:30,605
Cut!

141
00:11:42,045 --> 00:11:43,085
You did pretty well.

142
00:11:45,245 --> 00:11:47,765
You'd be great
as the female lead in the commercial.

143
00:11:48,445 --> 00:11:51,125
I hope we'll see you again in the future.

144
00:11:51,805 --> 00:11:52,885
Thank you, Mr. Chu.

145
00:11:52,965 --> 00:11:53,965
That's all for today.

146
00:12:02,325 --> 00:12:03,485
Mr. Chu,

147
00:12:04,165 --> 00:12:05,285
my friend really likes you.

148
00:12:05,805 --> 00:12:07,805
Could I get your autograph for her?

149
00:12:09,045 --> 00:12:10,685
Sure. No problem.

150
00:12:11,925 --> 00:12:14,645
My friend's name is Jia Fei. J-I-A, F-E-I.

151
00:12:24,045 --> 00:12:25,845
How did I offend him?

152
00:12:26,605 --> 00:12:28,325
That was the first time we met.

153
00:12:32,365 --> 00:12:33,365
Hello.

154
00:12:36,285 --> 00:12:37,685
Hello. What would you like to order?

155
00:12:38,245 --> 00:12:39,245
Two black coffees.

156
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:43,045
-Hello?
<i>-They chose a female lead for the ad.</i>

157
00:12:44,085 --> 00:12:46,125
That fast? Did I get it?

158
00:12:52,765 --> 00:12:53,605
Lisa,

159
00:12:53,965 --> 00:12:56,405
I'll keep working hard.

160
00:13:01,485 --> 00:13:04,925
I thought I did well.
Why didn't they pick me?

161
00:13:15,765 --> 00:13:17,445
Linlin, why are you home so early?

162
00:13:17,525 --> 00:13:18,885
I'm glad you're home.

163
00:13:18,965 --> 00:13:20,325
I got some food for you.

164
00:13:21,725 --> 00:13:24,445
I need to get to the office. Come with me.

165
00:13:24,525 --> 00:13:26,045
Let me rest for a bit.

166
00:13:26,125 --> 00:13:28,325
The casting didn't go well for me today.

167
00:13:35,285 --> 00:13:36,285
Who are you?

168
00:13:37,125 --> 00:13:38,005
Qin Jing?

169
00:13:38,085 --> 00:13:39,405
-Linlin, let me explain.
-Let go.

170
00:13:39,725 --> 00:13:40,725
Explain? How?

171
00:13:41,085 --> 00:13:43,925
Xia Lin, Jia Yan has wanted to dump you
for a long time.

172
00:13:44,605 --> 00:13:45,525
Handle this with grace,

173
00:13:46,365 --> 00:13:47,845
so things won't be too awkward.

174
00:13:48,805 --> 00:13:49,965
Stop talking.

175
00:13:50,845 --> 00:13:53,405
My college friend stole my boyfriend,

176
00:13:53,925 --> 00:13:55,205
and it's my own fault?

177
00:13:55,565 --> 00:13:56,485
What do you want then?

178
00:13:56,965 --> 00:13:58,045
What do I want?

179
00:13:59,125 --> 00:14:01,725
It must have been hard for you
to keep this from me.

180
00:14:02,525 --> 00:14:04,565
If you like him, he's all yours.

181
00:14:05,045 --> 00:14:06,005
I'm tired of him.

182
00:14:06,685 --> 00:14:08,365
-Linlin.
-Don't go after her!

183
00:14:13,125 --> 00:14:15,085
Cheaters deserve to be together. Have fun.

184
00:14:27,245 --> 00:14:28,645
I'll pick you up soon.

185
00:14:31,165 --> 00:14:32,165
Excuse me, miss.

186
00:14:32,245 --> 00:14:34,085
I'm about to go and pick up my girlfriend.

187
00:14:34,645 --> 00:14:35,685
Girlfriend?

188
00:14:36,205 --> 00:14:38,285
Now that you're in love,
you don't need to work.

189
00:14:38,365 --> 00:14:40,685
How do you know
she won't dump you or cheat on you?

190
00:14:40,765 --> 00:14:42,965
If you can't be sure,
why not drive me home first?

191
00:14:51,925 --> 00:14:52,765
Crazy.

192
00:14:55,445 --> 00:14:57,925
I'm an actress. I'm a future star.

193
00:14:58,445 --> 00:14:59,485
I have to look like a star.

194
00:15:01,885 --> 00:15:03,165
<i>Keep looking like a star.</i>

195
00:15:21,725 --> 00:15:24,885
Miss Xia,
leukemia isn't an incurable disease.

196
00:15:24,965 --> 00:15:26,485
If you start treatment early

197
00:15:26,565 --> 00:15:30,245
and find a bone marrow donor,
then your chances are good.

198
00:15:31,325 --> 00:15:34,445
You should call your family
and do a follow-up right away.

199
00:17:04,045 --> 00:17:08,725
GANGDONG INTERNATIONAL MEDICAL CENTER

200
00:17:09,005 --> 00:17:09,965
Yizhou...

201
00:17:10,965 --> 00:17:13,885
your mom called me yesterday.

202
00:17:17,925 --> 00:17:19,565
It's been so many years,

203
00:17:19,805 --> 00:17:21,045
you still can't forgive her?

204
00:17:22,765 --> 00:17:24,645
Does my forgiveness matter to her?

205
00:17:25,405 --> 00:17:28,765
She left me. She means nothing to me now.

206
00:17:31,925 --> 00:17:33,725
Alright. We don't need to talk about her.

207
00:17:34,605 --> 00:17:38,205
Chu Yan said An Ran is coming home
after she graduates.

208
00:17:39,245 --> 00:17:40,285
Really?

209
00:17:40,805 --> 00:17:42,125
Don't act like I'm stupid.

210
00:17:42,885 --> 00:17:45,485
You've been single for years.
You're waiting for her.

211
00:17:46,125 --> 00:17:47,645
Grandma, it's not like that.

212
00:17:48,565 --> 00:17:49,805
An Ran is like a sister to me.

213
00:17:50,405 --> 00:17:51,845
A sister?

214
00:17:53,325 --> 00:17:56,405
Could it be that you
actually like Chu Yan?

215
00:17:57,485 --> 00:17:58,605
Grandma.

216
00:17:59,685 --> 00:18:03,645
I know you don't trust people
because of your mom.

217
00:18:04,245 --> 00:18:06,965
But I'm old. I won't be around forever.

218
00:18:07,285 --> 00:18:11,165
I want you to have someone
who will love and cherish you.

219
00:18:11,645 --> 00:18:13,205
Or else I'll always worry about you.

220
00:18:14,125 --> 00:18:16,885
I'll like anyone you choose.

221
00:18:19,645 --> 00:18:22,205
But if you choose Chu Yan...

222
00:18:22,285 --> 00:18:24,565
would he be my daughter-in-law
or my grandson?

223
00:18:24,965 --> 00:18:25,845
Grandma,

224
00:18:26,485 --> 00:18:27,565
don't worry so much.

225
00:18:28,525 --> 00:18:29,925
I'll start thinking about marriage.

226
00:18:31,085 --> 00:18:32,045
You have a girlfriend?

227
00:18:34,725 --> 00:18:35,565
Kind of.

228
00:18:35,965 --> 00:18:37,125
What do you mean, "kind of"?

229
00:18:37,205 --> 00:18:38,805
Either you do or you don't.

230
00:18:39,405 --> 00:18:43,165
Do you not have time to date
because of work?

231
00:18:43,405 --> 00:18:45,085
Tell me what's going on.
I'll help you out.

232
00:18:45,845 --> 00:18:47,165
Grandma, I know what you mean.

233
00:18:48,325 --> 00:18:49,405
That's all that matters.

234
00:18:50,565 --> 00:18:54,085
Miss Xia, I'm sorry to inform you
that your diagnosis has been confirmed.

235
00:18:59,645 --> 00:19:01,365
There's only one way to cure leukemia...

236
00:19:01,925 --> 00:19:03,165
A stem cell transplant.

237
00:19:04,005 --> 00:19:06,485
We don't have any matches
in the donor registry right now.

238
00:19:06,885 --> 00:19:08,765
All we can do
is try to control it with drugs.

239
00:19:11,485 --> 00:19:12,485
So, what you mean is...

240
00:19:14,605 --> 00:19:15,605
chemotherapy?

241
00:19:16,365 --> 00:19:17,205
That's right.

242
00:19:23,365 --> 00:19:24,605
So, I'll end up...

243
00:19:26,325 --> 00:19:28,205
losing all my hair, right?

244
00:19:30,165 --> 00:19:31,445
I'll have diarrhea, too.

245
00:19:33,325 --> 00:19:34,885
I'll be so ugly.

246
00:19:37,045 --> 00:19:39,885
I won't be able to act anymore, right?

247
00:19:40,645 --> 00:19:41,605
Once you get better...

248
00:19:43,005 --> 00:19:44,725
you'll be able to do
whatever job you like.

249
00:19:46,485 --> 00:19:47,645
You'll be like...

250
00:19:48,565 --> 00:19:50,445
that American celebrity,

251
00:19:50,965 --> 00:19:51,965
Selena Gomez.

252
00:19:53,605 --> 00:19:57,765
She's been just as amazing
since she got a new kidney.

253
00:19:58,365 --> 00:19:59,525
Don't lose hope.

254
00:19:59,885 --> 00:20:01,925
Maybe you'll find a match very soon.

255
00:20:03,125 --> 00:20:04,405
Don't lie to me.

256
00:20:05,925 --> 00:20:07,165
I looked it up online.

257
00:20:09,085 --> 00:20:12,325
The chances of finding
a matching bone marrow donor are low.

258
00:20:19,325 --> 00:20:20,165
Doctor...

259
00:20:22,125 --> 00:20:24,245
is there something else
you aren't telling me?

260
00:20:24,965 --> 00:20:29,205
We did find a match
in the bone marrow registry...

261
00:20:31,885 --> 00:20:33,805
but this person
isn't willing to donate now.

262
00:20:34,685 --> 00:20:35,765
So...

263
00:20:35,845 --> 00:20:37,245
Tell me how to contact this person.

264
00:20:37,325 --> 00:20:39,445
I'll contact them myself.
I'll beg them to help me.

265
00:20:39,925 --> 00:20:41,765
Miss Xia, I'm so sorry.

266
00:20:42,765 --> 00:20:46,125
Hospitals aren't allowed
to give out donor information.

267
00:20:47,125 --> 00:20:47,965
But...

268
00:20:49,005 --> 00:20:49,845
Come in.

269
00:20:50,605 --> 00:20:53,125
-Dr. Ma, bed nine's relatives are here.
-OK.

270
00:20:53,965 --> 00:20:56,005
Miss Xia, please wait a moment.

271
00:20:56,085 --> 00:20:57,245
I need to leave for a minute.

272
00:21:20,805 --> 00:21:22,805
NAME: XIA LIN

273
00:21:22,885 --> 00:21:26,805
NAME: LING YIZHOU

274
00:21:27,405 --> 00:21:29,045
Ling Yizhou.

275
00:21:36,205 --> 00:21:39,605
"A well-known businessman
in Gangdong City.

276
00:21:39,685 --> 00:21:44,805
Chairman and CEO
of the Lingshi Group Company.

277
00:21:45,165 --> 00:21:49,885
Won the Gangdong
Outstanding Talent Award."

278
00:21:51,605 --> 00:21:55,285
Feifei? I thought you had rehearsal
tonight. Why are you home?

279
00:21:55,565 --> 00:21:56,765
Are you stupid?

280
00:21:57,045 --> 00:21:58,165
Why didn't you tell me?

281
00:22:00,525 --> 00:22:01,645
You know everything?

282
00:22:02,125 --> 00:22:04,485
That tramp sent a photo of them
to all her friends.

283
00:22:05,045 --> 00:22:05,885
What?

284
00:22:05,965 --> 00:22:07,365
That tramp, Qin Jing.

285
00:22:07,805 --> 00:22:10,325
You'd better not cry
over that piece of trash, Jia Yan.

286
00:22:10,405 --> 00:22:13,445
There's a lot of men out there,
but good ones are rare.

287
00:22:16,085 --> 00:22:17,805
That's what you're talking about?

288
00:22:21,165 --> 00:22:22,005
Ling Yizhou?

289
00:22:23,525 --> 00:22:24,645
I shouldn't have worried.

290
00:22:25,205 --> 00:22:26,845
You have a new target already.

291
00:22:28,045 --> 00:22:29,045
That's weird.

292
00:22:29,565 --> 00:22:31,765
Why would you suddenly
be interested in him?

293
00:22:36,085 --> 00:22:39,925
You read about him and Chu Yan every day.
Do you know him well?

294
00:22:40,485 --> 00:22:41,565
Of course.

295
00:22:41,845 --> 00:22:43,365
What do you want to know about?

296
00:22:45,405 --> 00:22:48,925
I want to know how to contact him
or where he lives.

297
00:22:50,685 --> 00:22:53,765
That's very aggressive.
Are you in love with him?

298
00:22:57,365 --> 00:22:58,285
Feifei.

299
00:22:58,605 --> 00:22:59,525
Yes?

300
00:23:12,005 --> 00:23:13,725
How could you?

301
00:23:13,805 --> 00:23:15,285
You should have told me sooner.

302
00:23:16,645 --> 00:23:20,525
I could at least go
to the hospital with you.

303
00:23:22,445 --> 00:23:24,765
I told you not to worry.

304
00:23:26,125 --> 00:23:29,165
Didn't you say Ling Yizhou is a match?

305
00:23:29,245 --> 00:23:30,405
Let's go see him right now.

306
00:23:30,845 --> 00:23:32,565
I just looked him up.

307
00:23:33,125 --> 00:23:36,365
The Lingshi Group office is
in the Gangdong Tower.

308
00:23:38,165 --> 00:23:40,645
But you can't go in there
unless you have an appointment.

309
00:23:41,325 --> 00:23:42,325
I have an idea.

310
00:23:49,285 --> 00:23:51,765
<i>Ladies, where can I</i>
<i>usually find Ling Yizhou?</i>

311
00:23:51,845 --> 00:23:53,725
<i>-It's an emergency.</i>
<i>-Where does he often go?</i>

312
00:23:53,805 --> 00:23:55,605
<i>Emergency!</i>
<i>Where does Mr. Ling often show up?</i>

313
00:23:55,685 --> 00:23:56,925
<i>I heard that he likes to swim.</i>

314
00:23:57,005 --> 00:24:02,645
Someone says he swims at the VIP Room
every Wednesday afternoon.

315
00:24:04,045 --> 00:24:04,885
Wednesday...

316
00:24:06,445 --> 00:24:07,605
That's tomorrow.

317
00:24:09,365 --> 00:24:13,245
We'll go to the pool tomorrow
and catch him off guard.

318
00:24:17,085 --> 00:24:19,805
<i>Ling Yizhou. 29 years old.</i>
<i>A member of the Gangdong elite.</i>

319
00:24:19,885 --> 00:24:22,285
<i>He's a distinguished, rich businessman.</i>

320
00:24:22,725 --> 00:24:26,805
<i>His fields of business include</i>
<i>real estate, showbiz, and electronics.</i>

321
00:24:26,925 --> 00:24:28,525
<i>He's low-key and mysterious though.</i>

322
00:24:28,605 --> 00:24:30,325
<i>You never see him in public.</i>

323
00:24:31,165 --> 00:24:34,965
<i>The only thing the media has on him</i>
<i>is that he's Chu Yan's friend.</i>

324
00:24:35,445 --> 00:24:38,325
<i>The nature of their relationship</i>
<i>remains unclear.</i>

325
00:24:49,565 --> 00:24:51,165
-This place is pretty cool.
-Come here.

326
00:24:51,245 --> 00:24:52,245
Let's take a selfie.

327
00:24:53,765 --> 00:24:55,805
Why does he kind of look familiar?

328
00:24:56,045 --> 00:24:58,125
He must be the third wheel.

329
00:24:58,205 --> 00:24:59,485
What do you mean "third wheel"?

330
00:24:59,565 --> 00:25:02,405
In Yizhou and Chu Yan's relationship.
His name is Wen Li.

331
00:25:02,725 --> 00:25:04,045
He's Ling Yizhou's assistant,

332
00:25:04,125 --> 00:25:05,965
his irreplaceable right-hand man.

333
00:25:06,045 --> 00:25:07,925
He's always at Yizhou's side.

334
00:25:08,285 --> 00:25:11,925
It's been said that he can read
Ling Yizhou's eyes.

335
00:25:12,605 --> 00:25:14,565
We'll have to deal with him
before we can get in.

336
00:25:14,645 --> 00:25:16,045
But how?

337
00:25:18,565 --> 00:25:19,485
I have an idea.

338
00:25:20,085 --> 00:25:21,445
What is it?

339
00:25:33,045 --> 00:25:34,085
Oh, my God!

340
00:25:34,885 --> 00:25:37,165
I hurt my leg!

341
00:25:39,245 --> 00:25:41,445
My leg hurts so bad!

342
00:25:41,765 --> 00:25:43,125
-Help!
-Oh, my leg.

343
00:25:43,205 --> 00:25:45,645
My friend hurt her leg.
Please help us! Help!

344
00:25:47,405 --> 00:25:48,685
It hurts so bad.

345
00:25:48,765 --> 00:25:51,405
Please help us. My friend hurt herself.

346
00:25:51,485 --> 00:25:52,645
Can you please help her?

347
00:25:52,725 --> 00:25:55,925
She can't get up.
I think she's going to die.

348
00:25:56,005 --> 00:25:57,045
Die.

349
00:25:57,845 --> 00:25:59,605
Sir, I'm begging you. Please.

350
00:25:59,685 --> 00:26:01,205
I'm begging you. Please help her.

351
00:26:01,285 --> 00:26:02,645
She's really hurt.

352
00:26:02,725 --> 00:26:04,045
I'm begging you. Please help us.

353
00:26:04,125 --> 00:26:06,525
Please, sir.

354
00:26:08,205 --> 00:26:10,085
Thank you, sir. Please, save her.

355
00:26:10,165 --> 00:26:11,965
She's about to pass out.

356
00:26:12,045 --> 00:26:13,645
-Please.
-You can get a staff member.

357
00:26:14,005 --> 00:26:15,885
I've been shouting, but no one came.

358
00:26:15,965 --> 00:26:19,005
I'm begging you. Can you please help us?

359
00:26:21,765 --> 00:26:22,605
Sir.

360
00:26:23,885 --> 00:26:24,965
Please save her.

361
00:26:30,685 --> 00:26:31,965
Miss, are you OK?

362
00:26:32,245 --> 00:26:33,485
I'm in so much pain.

363
00:26:34,485 --> 00:26:36,125
I can't move it at all.

364
00:26:36,565 --> 00:26:38,965
Sir, can you help me up?

365
00:26:47,125 --> 00:26:48,885
-What are you doing?
-Helping you up.

366
00:26:49,605 --> 00:26:50,605
Do you think I'm dirty?

367
00:26:51,005 --> 00:26:52,885
I'm sorry,
I don't like touching strangers.

368
00:27:00,645 --> 00:27:01,605
Where are you going?

369
00:27:06,405 --> 00:27:07,325
What are you doing?

370
00:27:07,405 --> 00:27:09,485
If I become a cripple
because I hurt my leg,

371
00:27:09,565 --> 00:27:10,965
will you take care of me?

372
00:27:12,605 --> 00:27:13,765
Why are you doing this?

373
00:27:14,445 --> 00:27:15,285
I...

374
00:27:16,085 --> 00:27:18,805
Help! Stop!

375
00:27:20,165 --> 00:27:24,445
Help me! He's sexually harassing me!

376
00:27:24,525 --> 00:27:25,605
Mr. Wen.

377
00:27:25,685 --> 00:27:26,525
I didn't touch you.

378
00:27:26,605 --> 00:27:27,525
Yes, you did.

379
00:27:29,405 --> 00:27:30,605
You have to take care of this.

380
00:27:30,685 --> 00:27:33,245
If you don't, I'll expose
what you did to the media.

381
00:27:43,725 --> 00:27:46,005
Just do whatever she asks us to do.

382
00:27:46,685 --> 00:27:47,525
Yes, sir.

383
00:28:08,205 --> 00:28:09,125
Mr. Ling.

384
00:28:10,925 --> 00:28:12,005
Mr. Ling.

385
00:28:12,805 --> 00:28:14,165
Mr. Ling Yizhou.

386
00:28:14,685 --> 00:28:15,725
Where is he?

387
00:28:18,365 --> 00:28:19,445
Mr. Ling.

388
00:28:20,005 --> 00:28:20,965
I need to talk to you.

389
00:28:21,285 --> 00:28:22,565
Look at me, Mr. Ling.

390
00:28:23,045 --> 00:28:24,885
I have to talk to you.

391
00:28:24,965 --> 00:28:26,205
I need to talk to you.

392
00:28:26,285 --> 00:28:27,765
Can you come up?

393
00:28:34,605 --> 00:28:35,445
Mr. Ling.

394
00:28:37,325 --> 00:28:39,845
Why do you always show up uninvited?

395
00:28:40,405 --> 00:28:42,285
Last time you got into my car
without asking.

396
00:28:43,445 --> 00:28:44,485
What do you want this time?

397
00:28:45,045 --> 00:28:46,565
You did me a big favor last time,

398
00:28:46,645 --> 00:28:49,005
so I came here to express
how grateful I am.

399
00:28:49,405 --> 00:28:50,605
Do you think I'd believe that?

400
00:28:51,725 --> 00:28:52,565
What is it?

401
00:28:53,085 --> 00:28:57,285
Mr. Ling, what do you think of me?

402
00:28:59,045 --> 00:29:00,525
Sorry, that doesn't work on me.

403
00:29:01,365 --> 00:29:02,565
That's not what I mean.

404
00:29:02,645 --> 00:29:03,805
I mean...

405
00:29:04,125 --> 00:29:08,045
What mental state do you think I'm in?

406
00:29:09,965 --> 00:29:11,325
What are you trying to say?

407
00:29:12,165 --> 00:29:13,325
Well...

408
00:29:14,205 --> 00:29:16,445
I went to the hospital
a few days ago for a check-up

409
00:29:17,405 --> 00:29:19,565
and I was diagnosed with leukemia.

410
00:29:20,605 --> 00:29:21,965
But I'm really lucky though,

411
00:29:22,045 --> 00:29:27,845
because I have a match
in the bone marrow registry.

412
00:29:28,365 --> 00:29:30,125
And that person
happens to live in Gangdong.

413
00:29:31,525 --> 00:29:33,525
And I just happen to be that person?

414
00:29:33,965 --> 00:29:35,045
Yes! That's right!

415
00:29:35,605 --> 00:29:37,605
No wonder I felt like
I've seen you before.

416
00:29:38,445 --> 00:29:43,045
We didn't just meet by chance.
Our fates are aligned.

417
00:29:44,005 --> 00:29:44,885
I'm sorry.

418
00:29:45,245 --> 00:29:46,125
I don't know you.

419
00:29:47,485 --> 00:29:48,645
We can get to know each other.

420
00:29:49,805 --> 00:29:52,645
Mr. Ling, we can get to know each other.

421
00:29:53,925 --> 00:29:55,045
Mr. Ling.

422
00:30:05,085 --> 00:30:06,285
What do you want?

423
00:30:07,485 --> 00:30:10,645
Nothing. Just stay here for a while.

424
00:30:11,765 --> 00:30:13,605
They have cameras here, you know?

425
00:30:14,085 --> 00:30:17,205
The tapes will show who's in the wrong.

426
00:30:17,565 --> 00:30:18,685
I'm going to the restroom.

427
00:30:20,085 --> 00:30:21,965
Stay here. I'll be back.

428
00:30:29,965 --> 00:30:30,925
Wait for me.

429
00:30:35,845 --> 00:30:37,085
Mr. Ling.

430
00:30:37,165 --> 00:30:40,365
You registered as a donor to help someone.

431
00:30:42,165 --> 00:30:43,485
I changed my mind.

432
00:30:43,885 --> 00:30:44,845
That's not true.

433
00:30:44,925 --> 00:30:47,565
From last time,
I know you're a good person.

434
00:30:47,965 --> 00:30:49,605
If you're concerned about your health,

435
00:30:49,685 --> 00:30:51,805
there's no need to worry.
I asked the doctor already.

436
00:30:52,165 --> 00:30:54,565
It won't do any harm to your body.

437
00:30:54,645 --> 00:30:55,485
That's not true.

438
00:30:56,405 --> 00:30:57,445
I'm a businessman.

439
00:30:57,965 --> 00:30:58,845
I don't take losses.

440
00:30:59,325 --> 00:31:02,605
Helping you doesn't benefit me
in any aspect.

441
00:31:03,125 --> 00:31:04,565
So, get going now.

442
00:31:04,885 --> 00:31:05,845
Please wait.

443
00:31:10,045 --> 00:31:11,125
Mr. Ling,

444
00:31:11,565 --> 00:31:14,285
I know I shouldn't have
intruded upon you like this.

445
00:31:14,805 --> 00:31:18,805
A few days ago,
I never would have done this.

446
00:31:19,645 --> 00:31:21,685
But I have no choice.

447
00:31:22,525 --> 00:31:23,845
I just want to keep on living.

448
00:31:24,965 --> 00:31:27,485
I'm sorry. I can't help you.

449
00:31:28,805 --> 00:31:29,645
Please leave.

450
00:31:31,525 --> 00:31:32,445
Fine.

451
00:31:33,685 --> 00:31:35,045
If I'm going to die...

452
00:31:36,205 --> 00:31:38,845
I might as well die in a beautiful way.

453
00:31:39,765 --> 00:31:43,845
Threatening a stranger
with your life isn't very wise.

454
00:31:53,605 --> 00:31:55,085
What is that supposed to do?

455
00:31:55,845 --> 00:31:57,405
Get back up here and get out.

456
00:32:03,125 --> 00:32:04,365
Keep acting then.

457
00:32:15,285 --> 00:32:16,125
Hey.

458
00:32:18,565 --> 00:32:19,765
Hey! Get out of the pool.

459
00:32:27,525 --> 00:32:28,365
Hey!

460
00:32:28,845 --> 00:32:31,085
Answer me. Are you OK?

461
00:32:38,365 --> 00:32:41,045
If you don't answer me,
I'll have to do mouth-to-mouth.

462
00:32:46,765 --> 00:32:49,045
You truly are an actress.
Very good at playing dead.

463
00:32:54,525 --> 00:32:56,165
Ling Yizhou, you're such a jerk.

464
00:33:01,045 --> 00:33:02,325
WEDNESDAY: THE POOL

465
00:33:02,405 --> 00:33:03,725
FRIDAY: COFFEE SHOP

466
00:33:41,885 --> 00:33:43,165
You don't work here, do you?

467
00:33:43,245 --> 00:33:44,885
-I was just hired.
-Which department?

468
00:33:45,485 --> 00:33:46,325
Where's your ID card?

469
00:33:47,325 --> 00:33:49,125
You're really good at your job.

470
00:33:49,805 --> 00:33:51,605
You're right. I don't work here.

471
00:33:52,005 --> 00:33:53,685
I came to see Mr. Ling. It's an emergency.

472
00:33:53,965 --> 00:33:55,045
Young lady,

473
00:33:55,325 --> 00:33:57,685
this isn't the way
to climb the social ladder.

474
00:33:58,165 --> 00:33:59,045
Get out of here.

475
00:33:59,565 --> 00:34:01,085
It's really an emergency.

476
00:34:01,405 --> 00:34:02,405
Does Mr. Ling know you?

477
00:34:02,885 --> 00:34:04,325
He's seen me twice.

478
00:34:04,765 --> 00:34:05,725
I'd say he knows me.

479
00:34:06,325 --> 00:34:07,565
Go get an appointment first.

480
00:34:08,325 --> 00:34:10,685
Why would I be here
if I had an appointment?

481
00:34:10,765 --> 00:34:11,885
Could you just let me in?

482
00:34:12,165 --> 00:34:14,045
It's a life-threatening emergency.

483
00:34:14,125 --> 00:34:17,445
You ladies are always making up stories.
Please leave.

484
00:34:17,845 --> 00:34:19,045
Please let me in.

485
00:34:19,125 --> 00:34:20,925
-I need to talk to him.
-Please leave.

486
00:34:21,965 --> 00:34:22,845
This way, please.

487
00:34:28,285 --> 00:34:30,204
-Demote the Planning Department manager.
-Got it.

488
00:34:33,765 --> 00:34:34,925
Mr. Ling.

489
00:34:35,605 --> 00:34:37,285
-Mr. Ling--
-One more chance.

490
00:34:38,965 --> 00:34:43,005
-You mean her--
-I mean the Planning Department manager.

491
00:34:43,605 --> 00:34:44,445
Got it.

492
00:34:49,125 --> 00:34:50,244
Mr. Ling.

493
00:35:10,525 --> 00:35:12,365
I'm looking for Ling Yizhou.

494
00:35:12,445 --> 00:35:13,725
I'm pregnant with his child.

495
00:35:13,805 --> 00:35:14,805
Last name, please?

496
00:35:15,405 --> 00:35:16,245
It's Xia.

497
00:35:16,925 --> 00:35:17,885
Alright, Miss Xia.

498
00:35:18,445 --> 00:35:19,445
Here's your number.

499
00:35:20,085 --> 00:35:22,365
Number? What do you mean?

500
00:35:22,565 --> 00:35:24,045
You have to wait in line.

501
00:35:24,325 --> 00:35:25,565
They're all pregnant.

502
00:35:38,685 --> 00:35:40,085
When will I be able to see him?

503
00:35:40,445 --> 00:35:41,925
You won't see Mr. Ling.

504
00:35:42,005 --> 00:35:44,005
Someone from
the Legal Department will meet you.

505
00:35:44,205 --> 00:35:45,485
Sorry, I got the wrong place.

506
00:35:45,565 --> 00:35:47,205
The man I'm looking for is next door.

507
00:35:47,285 --> 00:35:49,125
-Sorry.
-OK, take care.

508
00:35:50,005 --> 00:35:51,565
LINGSHI GROUP

509
00:35:56,485 --> 00:35:58,725
Feifei, I failed.

510
00:35:59,005 --> 00:36:00,245
Time for Plan B.

511
00:36:34,725 --> 00:36:37,405
Mr. Ling. Mr. Ling.

512
00:36:42,445 --> 00:36:43,525
What's wrong with your leg?

513
00:36:44,285 --> 00:36:46,325
It fell asleep from kneeling
down too long. It's fine.

514
00:36:47,325 --> 00:36:48,165
Get in the car.

515
00:36:49,205 --> 00:36:50,125
Me?

516
00:36:52,365 --> 00:36:53,365
I can help you.

517
00:36:57,765 --> 00:36:59,325
Mr. Ling, you're such a good person.

518
00:36:59,405 --> 00:37:00,685
But I have one condition.

519
00:37:00,765 --> 00:37:01,805
I'll do whatever you want.

520
00:37:02,805 --> 00:37:03,805
We'll see about that.

521
00:37:03,885 --> 00:37:06,685
I'll agree to anything. I'm serious.

522
00:37:07,725 --> 00:37:11,085
That being said,
I won't do anything illegal.

523
00:37:15,285 --> 00:37:17,285
-Marry me.
-What?

524
00:37:33,845 --> 00:37:34,765
<i>Please leave.</i>

525
00:37:34,845 --> 00:37:36,965
<i>I need to talk to him.</i>

526
00:37:37,325 --> 00:37:38,165
<i>This way, please.</i>

527
00:37:40,405 --> 00:37:42,525
Mr. Ling, how should we deal
with Miss Xia?

528
00:37:42,605 --> 00:37:45,845
Have security look the other way.

529
00:37:46,485 --> 00:37:48,205
I'm really not a business spy.

530
00:37:48,285 --> 00:37:49,725
I just need to talk to Mr. Ling.

531
00:37:49,805 --> 00:37:52,245
We'll need to investigate
before we can be sure.

532
00:37:52,925 --> 00:37:53,805
Please cooperate.

533
00:37:54,085 --> 00:37:55,365
-I will.
-Please leave.

534
00:37:55,445 --> 00:37:57,565
Please don't call the police.

535
00:37:58,005 --> 00:37:58,845
Please leave now.

536
00:39:40,565 --> 00:39:42,325

537
00:39:42,405 --> 00:39:44,965
Mr. Ling, marriage is something serious.

538
00:39:45,325 --> 00:39:47,245
Please don't joke around about my health.

539
00:39:48,245 --> 00:39:51,645
Ms. Xia, we're just taking
what we need from this marriage.

540
00:39:52,085 --> 00:39:54,645
Ling Yizhou, his best friend Chu Yan,

541
00:39:54,725 --> 00:39:57,125
and his assistant Wen Li
definitely have something going on.

542
00:39:57,205 --> 00:39:58,965
If that's not a love triangle, what is?

543
00:39:59,245 --> 00:40:04,725
So, he wants to marry me
to use me as his smokescreen.

544
00:40:05,005 --> 00:40:06,125
The reason isn't important.
