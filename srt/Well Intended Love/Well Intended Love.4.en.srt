1
00:00:13,165 --> 00:00:15,325
Mr. Wen, do you have a girlfriend?

2
00:00:15,685 --> 00:00:18,325
I want to focus on work.
I don't want to date right now.

3
00:00:18,405 --> 00:00:20,805
If a man really was interested in you,

4
00:00:20,885 --> 00:00:22,405
he'd do something about it.

5
00:00:23,085 --> 00:00:24,405
Ms. Huang works for Grandma.

6
00:00:24,485 --> 00:00:26,965
If she finds out we don't sleep together,
she'll be suspicious.

7
00:00:27,365 --> 00:00:28,845
But we signed a contract.

8
00:00:29,245 --> 00:00:31,285
An Ran, she isn't my friend.

9
00:00:31,685 --> 00:00:32,805
She's my wife.

10
00:00:33,285 --> 00:00:35,245
I don't have an ulterior motive.

11
00:00:35,605 --> 00:00:37,285
Ling Yizhou is an adult.

12
00:00:37,725 --> 00:00:39,445
Do you think I could trick him?

13
00:00:39,805 --> 00:00:43,485
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

14
00:02:10,445 --> 00:02:13,405
EPISODE 4

15
00:02:37,245 --> 00:02:41,525
This isn't what I wore yesterday.

16
00:02:49,765 --> 00:02:51,605
<i>He should be gone by now.</i>

17
00:03:08,205 --> 00:03:09,045
Morning.

18
00:03:09,685 --> 00:03:10,525
Morning.

19
00:03:11,365 --> 00:03:13,885
Don't you normally leave at eight?

20
00:03:14,645 --> 00:03:15,485
I got up late today.

21
00:03:17,885 --> 00:03:20,725
So, last night when I was drunk...

22
00:03:22,245 --> 00:03:23,925
I didn't do anything weird, right?

23
00:03:24,485 --> 00:03:25,565
You don't remember anything?

24
00:03:26,845 --> 00:03:29,205
It's the first time I've blacked out.

25
00:03:30,245 --> 00:03:31,245
You barfed all over me.

26
00:03:31,605 --> 00:03:34,245
Really? I'm so sorry.

27
00:03:34,565 --> 00:03:36,045
This is my first time getting drunk.

28
00:03:36,125 --> 00:03:38,405
-I'll be careful next time.
-There won't be a next time.

29
00:03:38,965 --> 00:03:40,045
No drinking anymore.

30
00:03:40,565 --> 00:03:43,645
Yesterday I had a curfew, today,
I can't drink. Any more restrictions?

31
00:03:43,725 --> 00:03:44,805
Might as well tell me now.

32
00:03:45,205 --> 00:03:47,845
We'll see how you do
and adjust accordingly.

33
00:03:48,605 --> 00:03:51,045
<i>Is he mad?</i>

34
00:03:52,925 --> 00:03:56,565
So, my clothes...

35
00:03:57,925 --> 00:03:58,885
Ms. Huang changed you.

36
00:04:16,925 --> 00:04:19,525
Something came up.
The meeting has been pushed back an hour

37
00:04:23,925 --> 00:04:26,885
<i>The real reason they postponed the meeting</i>
<i>is that Mr. Ling is late.</i>

38
00:04:28,245 --> 00:04:32,085
<i>The sun will rise in the west</i>
<i>before Mr. Ling ever runs late.</i>

39
00:04:32,885 --> 00:04:34,565
<i>But the group chat has never been wrong.</i>

40
00:04:35,205 --> 00:04:39,005
<i>Oh, no! Mr. Ling's eight-year perfect</i>
<i>attendance record is going to be broken!</i>

41
00:04:39,765 --> 00:04:43,125
<i>I just want to know why he was late.</i>
<i>Could he be dating someone?</i>

42
00:04:54,925 --> 00:04:55,965
-Ms. Huang.
-Yes?

43
00:04:56,485 --> 00:04:58,085
Get rid of all the alcohol in the house.

44
00:04:58,685 --> 00:04:59,645
Yes, sir.

45
00:05:18,565 --> 00:05:19,885
Is there something on my face?

46
00:05:26,325 --> 00:05:27,205
I'll get it.

47
00:05:46,445 --> 00:05:48,845
That's mine. Don't you only drink coffee?

48
00:05:49,445 --> 00:05:51,885
I know. I just wanted to drink yours.

49
00:06:01,605 --> 00:06:02,685
I'll give you a ride.

50
00:06:11,165 --> 00:06:12,845
Park here! Stop.

51
00:06:16,685 --> 00:06:18,005
Sorry, my foot slipped.

52
00:06:19,805 --> 00:06:23,285
Don't you know that the paparazzi
always camp out by the entrance?

53
00:06:23,365 --> 00:06:25,205
If they get a photo of us, it's over.

54
00:06:26,525 --> 00:06:28,405
Who cares if they do?
Then we can go public.

55
00:06:34,165 --> 00:06:35,085
For you. Take it.

56
00:06:38,405 --> 00:06:39,565
What is it?

57
00:06:44,925 --> 00:06:46,885
No way, this is too expensive.
I can't take it.

58
00:06:48,645 --> 00:06:50,485
This is a necessary prop for our act.

59
00:06:50,565 --> 00:06:51,885
Grandma would be suspicious.

60
00:06:52,285 --> 00:06:55,085
Props are always fake. This is overkill.

61
00:06:55,845 --> 00:06:58,005
Reporters are sharp.
They'll notice right away.

62
00:06:58,085 --> 00:06:59,205
I can't take it.

63
00:07:03,845 --> 00:07:04,725
What are you doing?

64
00:07:11,365 --> 00:07:12,565
Keep it on.

65
00:07:37,285 --> 00:07:38,565
It really is you, Director Ling.

66
00:07:39,165 --> 00:07:42,245
I thought this car looked familiar.
What are you doing here?

67
00:07:43,165 --> 00:07:44,005
Just passing by.

68
00:07:45,005 --> 00:07:46,485
How lucky.

69
00:07:47,045 --> 00:07:49,805
I have something to discuss with you.
Can you talk right now?

70
00:07:50,925 --> 00:07:52,245
Sure. What is it?

71
00:07:54,605 --> 00:07:55,445
Are you alright?

72
00:07:56,325 --> 00:07:57,565
-Let me see.
-I'm fine!

73
00:07:59,045 --> 00:08:00,405
There are mosquitos in my car.

74
00:08:00,485 --> 00:08:02,845
I just remembered something.
I have to get to the office.

75
00:08:19,525 --> 00:08:20,645
Did you do that on purpose?

76
00:08:22,525 --> 00:08:25,765
How do you know Lin Shuangshuang?

77
00:08:26,245 --> 00:08:27,725
She's our company's new spokesperson.

78
00:08:29,285 --> 00:08:31,605
She seems quite interested in you.

79
00:08:33,005 --> 00:08:33,845
Are you jealous?

80
00:08:36,365 --> 00:08:37,564
You're going to be late.

81
00:08:37,645 --> 00:08:39,845
Hurry up and go now. Bye.
I'll get going.

82
00:08:56,565 --> 00:08:59,005
What a player.

83
00:08:59,525 --> 00:09:01,685
Did I get an answer last night?

84
00:09:02,005 --> 00:09:05,045
Passing out at the most important moment,
I'm such an idiot.

85
00:09:06,405 --> 00:09:08,325
He has all these rules for me.

86
00:09:08,405 --> 00:09:10,005
It's like I'm one of his employees.

87
00:09:23,925 --> 00:09:26,645
<i>Not him again.</i>

88
00:09:49,125 --> 00:09:50,125
Hold it.

89
00:09:52,165 --> 00:09:54,485
Are you here to talk about
the red carpet event?

90
00:09:56,205 --> 00:09:58,725
I'll do my buddy Ling a favor

91
00:09:59,405 --> 00:10:00,645
and give you a tip.

92
00:10:10,045 --> 00:10:10,925
What's your problem?

93
00:10:12,165 --> 00:10:13,765
Your face looks better covered.

94
00:10:13,845 --> 00:10:14,765
Now you've got a shot.

95
00:10:15,405 --> 00:10:16,245
Trust me.

96
00:10:42,245 --> 00:10:44,725
Guess why Ms. Shuangshuang's
assistant came to PR?

97
00:10:45,005 --> 00:10:47,485
To find out about Ling Yizhou again?

98
00:10:48,085 --> 00:10:49,885
She went to Marketing, too?

99
00:10:49,965 --> 00:10:51,645
Isn't she embarrassed?
Causing such a stir?

100
00:10:52,205 --> 00:10:54,245
She finally became
the Lingshi Group spokesperson.

101
00:10:54,325 --> 00:10:56,805
Now she's trying to go after Ling Yizhou.

102
00:10:57,725 --> 00:10:59,965
No wonder there's been
so many rumors about them lately.

103
00:11:00,405 --> 00:11:03,365
<i>So, she is going after Ling Yizhou.</i>

104
00:11:04,365 --> 00:11:06,125
<i>If talking to her didn't work,</i>

105
00:11:06,565 --> 00:11:08,645
<i>I'll have her come to me.</i>

106
00:11:09,645 --> 00:11:11,165
<i>Sorry, Mr. Ling.</i>

107
00:11:11,405 --> 00:11:12,805
<i>I need to use your name.</i>

108
00:11:18,445 --> 00:11:20,405
You were talking about Ling Yizhou?

109
00:11:21,325 --> 00:11:24,125
I actually kind of know him.

110
00:11:25,965 --> 00:11:28,045
Write down the four points I just made.

111
00:11:28,525 --> 00:11:30,805
Or else you'll be on your own
for the report.

112
00:11:49,885 --> 00:11:51,165
Ms. Shuangshuang.

113
00:11:51,245 --> 00:11:54,645
I heard you know
Director Ling's housekeeper.

114
00:12:15,685 --> 00:12:16,685
Ma'am, you're home.

115
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:19,925
-Is he home?
-Not yet, but he should be soon.

116
00:12:20,845 --> 00:12:21,765
Ms. Huang.

117
00:12:21,845 --> 00:12:23,645
What does Ling Yizhou like?

118
00:12:24,405 --> 00:12:27,165
He's never really been
too fond of anything.

119
00:12:29,405 --> 00:12:30,925
But there is one thing now.

120
00:12:31,005 --> 00:12:31,885
What is it?

121
00:12:32,645 --> 00:12:34,285
You, ma'am!

122
00:12:37,845 --> 00:12:40,325
<i>I guess I'll have to risk it then.</i>

123
00:12:41,125 --> 00:12:42,645
<i>I'm sorry, Mr. Ling.</i>

124
00:12:50,645 --> 00:12:52,045
It's so clean in here.

125
00:13:29,725 --> 00:13:32,605
He was such a cute kid.

126
00:13:36,045 --> 00:13:39,045
How can there be nothing here?

127
00:13:40,965 --> 00:13:42,325
Maybe it's a study?

128
00:13:54,365 --> 00:13:55,325
Hi...

129
00:14:00,125 --> 00:14:01,405
What are you doing in my room?

130
00:14:02,805 --> 00:14:04,645
I didn't get a good look last time.

131
00:14:05,045 --> 00:14:07,365
So I came for another visit.

132
00:14:07,765 --> 00:14:09,365
I hate when people mess with my stuff.

133
00:14:09,845 --> 00:14:10,845
I'm sorry.

134
00:14:12,005 --> 00:14:14,925
I just wanted to get to know you more.

135
00:14:15,005 --> 00:14:18,125
So last night's incident
won't happen again.

136
00:14:18,925 --> 00:14:20,565
Can't you just ask me?

137
00:14:21,725 --> 00:14:22,565
What do you like?

138
00:14:26,045 --> 00:14:28,525
I mean, do you have
any interests or hobbies?

139
00:14:30,085 --> 00:14:30,925
I like work.

140
00:14:31,965 --> 00:14:33,205
That's not what I mean.

141
00:14:33,965 --> 00:14:35,045
I want to know

142
00:14:35,485 --> 00:14:38,565
what kind of gifts do you like
to get for your birthday?

143
00:14:40,205 --> 00:14:42,765
Nothing.
I've never celebrated my birthday.

144
00:14:45,525 --> 00:14:48,125
Never celebrated your birthday? Why?

145
00:14:49,165 --> 00:14:52,245
I get up at six o'clock to work out.
Breakfast is at seven. Only coffee.

146
00:14:52,325 --> 00:14:53,605
At eight, I go to work.

147
00:14:53,685 --> 00:14:55,525
If nothing comes up,
I'm home by seven o'clock.

148
00:14:55,605 --> 00:14:57,405
I hate spicy food
and weird-tasting vegetables.

149
00:14:57,485 --> 00:14:59,445
I only wear tailor-made clothes.
That's about it.

150
00:14:59,925 --> 00:15:01,725
Did you just...

151
00:15:01,805 --> 00:15:04,765
I'm introducing myself.
Didn't you want to get to know me?

152
00:15:06,125 --> 00:15:08,005
Should I introduce myself then?

153
00:15:08,405 --> 00:15:09,565
Your favorite color is blue.

154
00:15:09,645 --> 00:15:11,725
You like spicy food
and anything strawberry-flavored.

155
00:15:11,805 --> 00:15:13,845
You hate the smell of smoke
and love to sing.

156
00:15:14,245 --> 00:15:15,965
Your dream is to win Best Actress.

157
00:15:17,605 --> 00:15:18,605
How did you know?

158
00:15:20,525 --> 00:15:22,605
Because I do my homework.

159
00:15:33,445 --> 00:15:34,285
What are you doing?

160
00:15:34,925 --> 00:15:36,405
This is my room.

161
00:15:36,765 --> 00:15:38,165
I can do whatever I want.

162
00:15:41,365 --> 00:15:43,405
I'm going to shower.
Would you like to join me?

163
00:15:49,085 --> 00:15:52,765
Did he just flirt with me?

164
00:15:57,285 --> 00:15:59,245
<i>And I still got no answers.</i>

165
00:15:59,845 --> 00:16:03,365
<i>What am I supposed</i>
<i>to tell Yin Shuangshuang tomorrow?</i>

166
00:16:09,765 --> 00:16:13,365
Robots. Right. He likes robots!

167
00:16:20,565 --> 00:16:23,685
He doesn't really seem like the kind
of person who'd like these things.

168
00:16:25,045 --> 00:16:26,445
Don't worry, Ms. Shuangshuang.

169
00:16:26,525 --> 00:16:28,885
This information is totally reliable.

170
00:16:33,205 --> 00:16:36,685
Alright then. Grab this.
Come visit the Lingshi Group with me.

171
00:16:37,485 --> 00:16:40,165
Visit the Lingshi Group?

172
00:16:40,845 --> 00:16:43,645
I want to invite Director Ling
to attend the film premiere with me.

173
00:16:44,045 --> 00:16:46,845
We can check whether
your information is true or not.

174
00:17:06,925 --> 00:17:08,165
Director Ling.

175
00:17:08,725 --> 00:17:09,805
You have five minutes.

176
00:17:10,245 --> 00:17:11,124
Start talking.

177
00:17:12,124 --> 00:17:13,765
I wanted to ask you yesterday

178
00:17:13,844 --> 00:17:16,925
if you'd join me at the movie premiere
tomorrow evening.

179
00:17:17,525 --> 00:17:20,165
Miss Yin, you should know
that I never go to events like that.

180
00:17:28,084 --> 00:17:30,285
Director Ling, I know that

181
00:17:30,364 --> 00:17:32,445
you collect robots like this.

182
00:17:32,525 --> 00:17:34,605
So I went out and bought one just for you.

183
00:17:46,845 --> 00:17:48,005
Thank you for your gift.

184
00:17:49,005 --> 00:17:50,525
But I can't accept your invitation.

185
00:17:51,205 --> 00:17:53,045
Five minutes are up. Goodbye.

186
00:17:53,925 --> 00:17:56,045
-I'm in trouble.
-Director Ling! I...

187
00:17:56,325 --> 00:17:57,165
I...

188
00:18:09,645 --> 00:18:12,285
Do you think I look like an idiot?

189
00:18:13,205 --> 00:18:15,605
No. I would never lie to you.

190
00:18:15,685 --> 00:18:18,925
Xia Lin, I thought
you were an honest person.

191
00:18:19,005 --> 00:18:20,885
That's why I believed you.

192
00:18:22,485 --> 00:18:26,325
You're just a D-list actress.
How dare you fool me?

193
00:18:27,445 --> 00:18:28,965
I wasn't lying.

194
00:18:29,045 --> 00:18:32,005
When Director Ling was a kid,
he had the exact same robot.

195
00:18:32,085 --> 00:18:33,085
Where's the proof?

196
00:18:35,205 --> 00:18:36,565
You're still lying to me.

197
00:18:36,845 --> 00:18:38,085
Xia Lin, you listen to me.

198
00:18:38,885 --> 00:18:40,725
You're not walking
the red carpet tomorrow.

199
00:18:41,205 --> 00:18:42,325
Not just the red carpet,

200
00:18:42,405 --> 00:18:44,645
you're not going
to any company events ever again!

201
00:18:44,725 --> 00:18:46,885
How can I make you believe me,
Shuangshuang?

202
00:18:47,365 --> 00:18:48,205
Director Ling.

203
00:18:51,205 --> 00:18:52,045
You...

204
00:18:54,925 --> 00:18:55,845
Do you know me?

205
00:18:56,485 --> 00:18:57,685
I didn't before.

206
00:18:58,685 --> 00:18:59,525
Now I do.

207
00:19:02,005 --> 00:19:03,325
Then why did you say that

208
00:19:04,085 --> 00:19:06,205
I had the exact same robot
when I was a child?

209
00:19:06,685 --> 00:19:07,565
I...

210
00:19:11,365 --> 00:19:12,325
It was a guess.

211
00:19:15,885 --> 00:19:20,445
Don't all boys like cars and toy models?

212
00:19:23,525 --> 00:19:24,645
I couldn't afford a car.

213
00:19:27,965 --> 00:19:31,165
Director Ling,
I had her buy this gift for you.

214
00:19:31,645 --> 00:19:33,285
If you don't like it, that's fine.

215
00:19:33,365 --> 00:19:34,565
I'll keep it in mind next time

216
00:19:34,645 --> 00:19:36,085
-and buy you a different gift.
-No.

217
00:19:38,045 --> 00:19:39,045
I like the gift a lot.

218
00:19:41,005 --> 00:19:43,365
-I'll go to the event.
-Really, Director Ling?

219
00:19:44,485 --> 00:19:46,005
Mr. Ling, you have a meeting tomorrow.

220
00:19:46,085 --> 00:19:47,125
-Reschedule it.
-OK.

221
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:50,445
Hey.

222
00:19:52,525 --> 00:19:53,365
You.

223
00:19:54,325 --> 00:19:55,165
Come here.

224
00:20:04,885 --> 00:20:05,885
Give it to me.

225
00:20:19,405 --> 00:20:22,525
-Goodbye.
-Bye-bye! Bye.

226
00:20:27,005 --> 00:20:28,965
You really got lucky, didn't you?

227
00:20:30,045 --> 00:20:32,565
But, since you completed your mission,

228
00:20:33,205 --> 00:20:34,765
I'll uphold my end of the deal.

229
00:20:35,245 --> 00:20:39,125
Pick up your dress
from the company tomorrow.

230
00:20:51,485 --> 00:20:55,205
I'm sorry. If I buy you a shirt,
will you forgive me?

231
00:20:57,005 --> 00:21:00,845
What if I bought you some pants?

232
00:21:04,205 --> 00:21:05,725
What should I...

233
00:21:34,605 --> 00:21:35,445
Miss.

234
00:21:36,165 --> 00:21:37,485
Can you get me one of these?

235
00:21:37,565 --> 00:21:39,005
Sorry, miss. This is the last one.

236
00:21:39,725 --> 00:21:41,045
Why?

237
00:21:43,485 --> 00:21:44,445
Sir.

238
00:21:45,685 --> 00:21:48,205
Could I buy that tie from you?

239
00:21:48,525 --> 00:21:49,445
Why?

240
00:21:49,685 --> 00:21:51,925
Because they said it's the last one.

241
00:21:52,525 --> 00:21:54,045
And I saw it first.

242
00:21:54,325 --> 00:21:55,845
I just wasn't as quick as you.

243
00:21:56,725 --> 00:21:57,845
But I like it, too.

244
00:21:59,525 --> 00:22:01,525
My boyfriend and I are fighting.

245
00:22:02,125 --> 00:22:04,005
I want to buy him a present
to make up for it.

246
00:22:04,765 --> 00:22:06,685
I spent so much time
looking for a good gift.

247
00:22:07,005 --> 00:22:08,405
Please let me have it.

248
00:22:09,165 --> 00:22:10,285
Please.

249
00:22:11,045 --> 00:22:13,045
Alright. I won't be a bad person.

250
00:22:13,685 --> 00:22:15,965
This tie is really nice.
Your boyfriend should forgive you.

251
00:22:18,365 --> 00:22:20,085
Really? Thank you.

252
00:22:20,165 --> 00:22:21,205
How much was it?

253
00:22:22,045 --> 00:22:22,885
Sir!

254
00:22:27,085 --> 00:22:29,005
What a nice man.

255
00:22:29,605 --> 00:22:30,925
I'll pay him back some day.

256
00:22:49,685 --> 00:22:51,925
Sir, she's not in a good mood today.

257
00:22:52,285 --> 00:22:53,485
She hasn't eaten any dinner.

258
00:22:53,565 --> 00:22:56,085
She's been in her room
and hasn't come out.

259
00:22:56,885 --> 00:22:57,725
I understand.

260
00:23:16,925 --> 00:23:17,765
Can I help you?

261
00:23:18,445 --> 00:23:20,165
Do you have a minute?

262
00:23:20,245 --> 00:23:22,045
I have something to tell you.

263
00:23:22,125 --> 00:23:22,965
Go on.

264
00:23:28,405 --> 00:23:29,245
For me?

265
00:23:31,925 --> 00:23:33,885
Haven't you already given me a toy robot?

266
00:23:34,725 --> 00:23:36,845
Sorry about the robot thing.

267
00:23:37,205 --> 00:23:40,605
When I went into your room last night,
I saw the picture on your nightstand.

268
00:23:40,685 --> 00:23:42,685
-So...
-So when you asked about my interests,

269
00:23:42,765 --> 00:23:44,805
it was all for Yin Shuangshuang. Why?

270
00:23:44,885 --> 00:23:47,685
I can only go to the premiere
if I help her.

271
00:23:48,285 --> 00:23:50,925
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have violated your privacy.

272
00:23:51,285 --> 00:23:52,805
I apologize.

273
00:23:56,325 --> 00:23:59,605
One of my family members gave me
this robot when I turned eight.

274
00:24:00,765 --> 00:24:01,925
I lost it a long time ago.

275
00:24:03,165 --> 00:24:04,965
I should thank you
for buying it for me again.

276
00:24:06,525 --> 00:24:09,485
I really just didn't think it all through.

277
00:24:09,925 --> 00:24:11,125
I'm really sorry.

278
00:24:16,085 --> 00:24:17,005
Besides this...

279
00:24:18,205 --> 00:24:20,365
is there anything else
you should apologize for?

280
00:24:30,645 --> 00:24:31,925
You didn't wear the ring today.

281
00:24:36,645 --> 00:24:37,725
That's my bad.

282
00:24:38,325 --> 00:24:39,805
If you forgive me,

283
00:24:40,325 --> 00:24:42,645
I'll agree to whatever you ask.

284
00:24:42,885 --> 00:24:43,725
Are you sure?

285
00:24:44,325 --> 00:24:46,485
What I mean is,
I'll do whatever I can do for you.

286
00:24:50,605 --> 00:24:51,965
You've already done it.

287
00:24:54,765 --> 00:24:56,885
I'll gladly prove you wrong.

288
00:25:05,685 --> 00:25:09,245
-You... That night... We...
-Remember now?

289
00:25:09,845 --> 00:25:11,525
So you're not...

290
00:25:13,925 --> 00:25:15,685
Looks like I need
to prove you wrong again.

291
00:25:21,805 --> 00:25:24,405
Fine. I forgive you.

292
00:25:25,445 --> 00:25:26,765
Don't let it happen again.

293
00:25:43,285 --> 00:25:47,045
What should I do? Xia Lin,
you're an idiot. Why did you drink?

294
00:25:47,925 --> 00:25:52,205
What should I do?

295
00:26:00,565 --> 00:26:02,205
Hello? An Ran?

296
00:26:08,445 --> 00:26:09,685
What about this pair?

297
00:26:10,885 --> 00:26:13,125
They look good.
I think they suit you really well.

298
00:26:13,205 --> 00:26:14,285
Thank you for coming.

299
00:26:14,765 --> 00:26:16,885
I'm sorry it was so sudden.

300
00:26:17,725 --> 00:26:19,725
It's fine. I forgot to buy shoes
yesterday anyways.

301
00:26:20,125 --> 00:26:22,845
I'm going to the premiere tonight.
I might as well buy a pair.

302
00:26:23,205 --> 00:26:24,725
I'm an expert at this.

303
00:26:24,805 --> 00:26:26,285
I'll choose some for you.

304
00:26:26,925 --> 00:26:27,765
Sure.

305
00:26:34,085 --> 00:26:37,525
Are you and Yizhou getting along?

306
00:26:37,845 --> 00:26:38,965
We're doing OK.

307
00:26:39,205 --> 00:26:42,005
It's just that he can be
a bit domineering sometimes.

308
00:26:42,805 --> 00:26:45,725
He actually has a pretty good temper.

309
00:26:46,045 --> 00:26:50,445
He's used to calling the shots at work.
It probably affects his personal life.

310
00:26:51,285 --> 00:26:52,645
I know, right?

311
00:26:52,965 --> 00:26:56,725
When he doesn't like something,
there's no room for discussion.

312
00:26:56,805 --> 00:26:59,605
He always has so many rules and demands.

313
00:27:02,685 --> 00:27:04,085
What do you think of this pair?

314
00:27:04,845 --> 00:27:06,605
Can't let your shoes steal the show,
right?

315
00:27:09,245 --> 00:27:10,245
That's true.

316
00:27:16,405 --> 00:27:18,205
No, these are way too expensive.

317
00:27:18,285 --> 00:27:20,005
I ran through my credit card yesterday.

318
00:27:20,085 --> 00:27:21,005
Let's try another pair.

319
00:27:21,685 --> 00:27:23,165
Just have Yizhou buy them for you.

320
00:27:23,445 --> 00:27:26,125
He's always been generous with gifts.

321
00:27:26,685 --> 00:27:29,205
So, of course,
he wouldn't be stingy with you.

322
00:27:29,525 --> 00:27:31,885
But I don't want to...

323
00:27:33,525 --> 00:27:36,405
We'll take this pair.
Don't worry about it.

324
00:27:37,325 --> 00:27:39,925
If you really aren't comfortable with it,
I'll buy them for you.

325
00:27:41,045 --> 00:27:42,005
Don't do that.

326
00:27:42,085 --> 00:27:45,805
I have another card.

327
00:27:48,365 --> 00:27:50,725
I'll just use this one, I guess.

328
00:27:52,165 --> 00:27:53,925
Give me a minute. I'll go pay for them.

329
00:28:08,325 --> 00:28:10,365
This is all that Marketing has done
in one month?

330
00:28:11,085 --> 00:28:13,925
Tell them that I want
a completely new idea,

331
00:28:14,525 --> 00:28:16,565
not just putting lipstick on a pig.

332
00:28:17,645 --> 00:28:20,565
If they can't even grasp
this simple concept,

333
00:28:21,085 --> 00:28:22,845
we'll fire them all today.

334
00:28:24,045 --> 00:28:24,885
Yes, sir.

335
00:28:28,925 --> 00:28:31,605
Boss, I didn't buy that tie for you,
did I?

336
00:28:34,485 --> 00:28:35,525
Mumu bought it for me.

337
00:28:37,125 --> 00:28:38,245
Your wife has a good eye.

338
00:28:41,405 --> 00:28:42,285
That's for sure.

339
00:28:48,445 --> 00:28:50,525
YOUR CARD WAS CHARGED 3,980RMB AT 11:40

340
00:28:55,285 --> 00:28:56,125
Wen Li.

341
00:28:59,885 --> 00:29:03,965
Tell Marketing I'll give them
another three days.

342
00:29:04,885 --> 00:29:05,845
Yes, sir.

343
00:29:21,405 --> 00:29:22,325
Not bad.

344
00:29:23,005 --> 00:29:25,725
Don't forget that the designer
sponsored this dress.

345
00:29:25,805 --> 00:29:27,525
This is the only one. Don't damage it.

346
00:29:28,285 --> 00:29:30,685
Go find Shuangshuang
and try to match your walking paces.

347
00:29:31,285 --> 00:29:32,805
Got it. Don't worry, Lisa.

348
00:29:33,365 --> 00:29:34,205
Go now.

349
00:29:41,925 --> 00:29:44,085
You must be Xia Lin. Hello, I'm Su Xi.

350
00:29:44,605 --> 00:29:45,525
Hello.

351
00:29:45,605 --> 00:29:48,045
You'll be walking
the red carpet with me tonight?

352
00:29:48,565 --> 00:29:50,365
Oh, good. I finally found a partner!

353
00:29:50,445 --> 00:29:52,805
I'm so nervous.
I'm worried my legs will give out.

354
00:29:53,445 --> 00:29:56,125
Imagine yourself walking through a zoo
and you'll be just fine.

355
00:29:57,565 --> 00:30:00,685
Don't you know who's going to be there?
How could they be animals?

356
00:30:00,965 --> 00:30:02,285
Humans are just advanced animals.

357
00:30:02,885 --> 00:30:03,885
I guess so.

358
00:30:05,685 --> 00:30:07,605
Your dress looks a lot like mine.

359
00:30:09,405 --> 00:30:10,965
It's to accentuate Shuangshuang.

360
00:30:12,485 --> 00:30:13,325
Let's go.

361
00:30:13,845 --> 00:30:15,485
WET PAINT

362
00:30:19,485 --> 00:30:20,645
Xialin, are you OK?

363
00:30:21,605 --> 00:30:22,445
I'm fine.

364
00:30:26,885 --> 00:30:29,325
I'm sorry, Xia Lin.
I wasn't standing steady.

365
00:30:29,765 --> 00:30:31,325
It's fine. It's not your fault.

366
00:30:32,605 --> 00:30:33,925
Hey, hey, hey.

367
00:30:34,805 --> 00:30:36,965
Which drama are you two
supposed to be acting in?

368
00:30:41,605 --> 00:30:43,765
Su Xi, go ahead and find Shuangshuang.

369
00:30:44,045 --> 00:30:46,285
-But you...
-I'm fine, just go.

370
00:30:57,605 --> 00:30:59,285
-Are you alright?
-As if you care.

371
00:31:06,685 --> 00:31:07,525
Great job there.

372
00:31:11,565 --> 00:31:12,605
Oh, God!

373
00:31:16,165 --> 00:31:18,325
This dress is mainly made of silk.

374
00:31:19,205 --> 00:31:20,845
I bet the stain won't come out.

375
00:31:20,925 --> 00:31:22,845
Keep talking and I'll--

376
00:31:22,925 --> 00:31:23,765
What's the matter?

377
00:31:25,565 --> 00:31:26,485
Gosh, Xia Lin!

378
00:31:26,725 --> 00:31:27,925
How many times did I tell you?

379
00:31:28,005 --> 00:31:29,445
This is a haute couture piece!

380
00:31:29,525 --> 00:31:32,525
Use that backed-up brain of yours
and think about what that means!

381
00:31:33,085 --> 00:31:36,205
Do you know how much this dress cost?
How will I explain this to the designer?

382
00:31:37,645 --> 00:31:40,885
I'm so sorry, Lisa.
I'll find a way to fix it.

383
00:31:40,965 --> 00:31:42,645
Fix it? How are you going to fix it?

384
00:31:43,285 --> 00:31:44,125
I warned you.

385
00:31:44,525 --> 00:31:45,805
This is all your fault.

386
00:31:46,485 --> 00:31:48,205
The company is going to blame this on you.

387
00:31:48,285 --> 00:31:51,405
If you can't take care of this,
the brand will blacklist us.

388
00:31:52,165 --> 00:31:54,885
Don't bother going to the event tonight.
Su Xi will go on her own.

389
00:32:11,205 --> 00:32:12,885
Do you feel good about yourself right now?

390
00:32:13,485 --> 00:32:16,045
Someone like you wouldn't survive
two episodes in a TV series.

391
00:32:18,405 --> 00:32:21,165
Don't waste your time
trying to get the stain out.

392
00:32:21,485 --> 00:32:23,965
She wouldn't have pushed you
if you could get it out.

393
00:32:24,965 --> 00:32:26,005
How is this your business?

394
00:32:27,285 --> 00:32:29,325
Actually, you wouldn't even
last one episode.

395
00:32:30,125 --> 00:32:31,165
What do you want me to do?

396
00:32:31,845 --> 00:32:34,365
Take Su Xi's dress and blame it on her?

397
00:32:34,845 --> 00:32:37,365
Then walk with Ms. Shuangshuang
on the red carpet with a smile?

398
00:32:37,445 --> 00:32:38,965
Then I'd be just like her.

399
00:32:41,325 --> 00:32:43,725
At least she showed me
her true self right off the bat.

400
00:32:43,805 --> 00:32:45,245
I'm going to get this dress clean.

401
00:32:45,325 --> 00:32:47,565
She wants all the glory for herself?
Not going to happen.

402
00:33:13,885 --> 00:33:15,725
-Hello?
<i>-Did you get the stain out?</i>

403
00:33:16,125 --> 00:33:19,285
No. What's going on over there? Any news?

404
00:33:19,685 --> 00:33:22,285
My friend has a similar dress.
I'll meet you at the entrance.

405
00:33:22,725 --> 00:33:23,725
Really?

406
00:33:23,805 --> 00:33:25,965
I've asked so many people.
I knew I could count on you.

407
00:33:26,045 --> 00:33:27,445
I love you so much, Fei!

408
00:33:44,285 --> 00:33:45,125
Ma'am.

409
00:33:46,485 --> 00:33:48,085
Wen Li, what are you doing here?

410
00:33:48,445 --> 00:33:50,805
Miss Jia sent me.
Mr. Ling is waiting for you in the lounge.

411
00:33:51,205 --> 00:33:52,045
Please.

412
00:33:52,125 --> 00:33:54,245
<i>That traitor Feifei.</i>

413
00:34:06,445 --> 00:34:07,405
Hi.

414
00:34:08,125 --> 00:34:09,205
Why didn't you tell me?

415
00:34:10,045 --> 00:34:11,365
You're always busy.

416
00:34:11,445 --> 00:34:14,565
I didn't want to bother you.

417
00:34:14,965 --> 00:34:15,965
I'm your husband.

418
00:34:16,925 --> 00:34:18,965
You'd rather get help
from Jia Fei and not me?

419
00:34:19,684 --> 00:34:21,405
You're my nominal husband.

420
00:34:21,644 --> 00:34:24,684
But she's my true family.

421
00:34:26,925 --> 00:34:28,925
-What are you doing?
-Say that again.

422
00:34:29,445 --> 00:34:30,325
Ouch.

423
00:34:33,125 --> 00:34:33,965
What's wrong?

424
00:34:34,925 --> 00:34:37,125
It's fine. I just accidentally
bumped into something.

425
00:34:38,805 --> 00:34:39,765
Don't go to the event.

426
00:34:42,085 --> 00:34:42,925
Why?

427
00:34:43,005 --> 00:34:44,845
I can deal with the curfew
and no drinking,

428
00:34:45,244 --> 00:34:47,765
but this is my job.
You can't decide things for me.

429
00:34:55,204 --> 00:34:56,565
Isn't that the tie I bought you?

430
00:34:57,885 --> 00:34:59,325
It suits you well.

431
00:35:01,644 --> 00:35:03,325
What are you going to do?

432
00:35:06,205 --> 00:35:08,245
I'm going to talk to the designer

433
00:35:08,325 --> 00:35:10,965
and see if they have
a similar outfit that I can wear.

434
00:35:11,965 --> 00:35:14,405
Why didn't you just ask me for help?

435
00:35:15,765 --> 00:35:16,925
It didn't cross my mind.

436
00:35:18,845 --> 00:35:20,885
There are 12 custom-made versions
of that dress.

437
00:35:21,245 --> 00:35:23,845
I'll have someone bringing over
the most similar one.

438
00:35:24,085 --> 00:35:25,245
Just change into that.

439
00:35:27,085 --> 00:35:29,485
What about the dress I ruined?

440
00:35:30,325 --> 00:35:32,165
-Will they make me pay?
-No.

441
00:35:33,245 --> 00:35:34,925
I bought out their design
and supply chain.

442
00:35:36,125 --> 00:35:38,605
Did you do that because of me?

443
00:35:38,685 --> 00:35:39,525
You think too much.

444
00:35:39,965 --> 00:35:42,965
We've been planning it for a while.
I just pushed things forward a bit.

445
00:35:44,645 --> 00:35:47,125
Either way, thank you so much.

446
00:35:49,885 --> 00:35:52,925
No need to thank me.
I wasn't helping you anyways.

447
00:35:53,405 --> 00:35:55,005
I was helping out Mrs. Ling.

448
00:35:55,085 --> 00:35:58,245
She's a reflection of my reputation.

449
00:35:59,885 --> 00:36:02,205
-Nobody knows that we're married.
-I do.

450
00:36:05,605 --> 00:36:06,805
Wait here a while.

451
00:36:06,885 --> 00:36:08,725
After you change,
you can eat and head out.

452
00:36:35,725 --> 00:36:36,605
Su Xi.

453
00:36:37,605 --> 00:36:39,485
You'll walk behind
Shuangshuang and Chu Yan.

454
00:36:39,565 --> 00:36:41,165
Don't make any weird faces.

455
00:36:41,445 --> 00:36:43,725
Remember that you're only here
as an accessory.

456
00:36:43,805 --> 00:36:44,805
Got it, Lisa.

457
00:36:45,325 --> 00:36:47,685
Since Xia Lin isn't here,
I won't embarrass the company.

458
00:36:48,445 --> 00:36:49,565
Who says I'm not here?

459
00:36:49,925 --> 00:36:50,925
Xia Lin?

460
00:36:52,925 --> 00:36:54,925
Lisa, I'll do my best as well.

461
00:36:55,805 --> 00:36:57,045
Let's follow the original plan.

462
00:36:57,485 --> 00:36:58,885
Get ready and let's go.

463
00:37:00,005 --> 00:37:00,845
Nice dress.

464
00:37:01,525 --> 00:37:02,765
Thank you, Ms. Shuangshuang.

465
00:37:02,845 --> 00:37:04,645
-I'm going to the restroom.
-I'll go with you.

466
00:37:05,925 --> 00:37:06,765
Xia Lin, I...

467
00:37:08,725 --> 00:37:10,925
Looks like you're not nervous anymore.
Good luck.

468
00:37:11,845 --> 00:37:14,405
I hope what you did was worth it.

469
00:37:27,525 --> 00:37:31,445
Mrs. Ling is quite impressive.
She can even wash out paint stains.

470
00:37:32,965 --> 00:37:36,325
You were acting all self-sufficient
a while ago.

471
00:37:36,405 --> 00:37:37,765
But you still went to Ling.

472
00:37:38,285 --> 00:37:40,365
Yes, he's my husband.

473
00:37:40,445 --> 00:37:42,845
Who else would I go to? You?

474
00:37:43,205 --> 00:37:44,045
You...

475
00:37:44,965 --> 00:37:45,965
That's right, Mr. Chu.

476
00:37:46,445 --> 00:37:49,005
I know feelings can be hard to control.

477
00:37:49,085 --> 00:37:50,485
But he's already married.

478
00:37:50,565 --> 00:37:53,205
So it would be best for you to give up.

479
00:37:54,525 --> 00:37:55,365
You're crazy.

480
00:37:58,445 --> 00:37:59,285
Let's go.

481
00:38:08,125 --> 00:38:08,965
This way, please.

482
00:38:09,845 --> 00:38:13,565
THE 12TH ANNUAL GANGDONG FILM FESTIVAL

483
00:38:23,325 --> 00:38:24,885
This can't be real.

484
00:38:37,765 --> 00:38:41,165
How can shoes this expensive
be such poor quality?

485
00:38:42,605 --> 00:38:44,165
My red carpet...

486
00:38:44,685 --> 00:38:46,485
My media exposure...

487
00:38:56,565 --> 00:38:57,685
What are you doing?

488
00:38:59,565 --> 00:39:00,605
Here's some ointment.

489
00:39:02,565 --> 00:39:06,605
I... I can do it myself.

490
00:39:09,565 --> 00:39:13,325
You weren't this polite yesterday when you
used me to suck up to Yin Shuangshuang.

491
00:39:15,285 --> 00:39:18,565
I thought you'd forgiven me for that.

492
00:39:19,925 --> 00:39:21,445
OK. Lie down.

493
00:39:22,005 --> 00:39:23,285
Hurry up now. On your side.

494
00:39:40,005 --> 00:39:40,845
Don't move.

495
00:39:42,685 --> 00:39:44,085
Do you want me to force you?

496
00:39:53,125 --> 00:39:59,445
You can just have Ms. Huang do it.

497
00:40:06,565 --> 00:40:08,645
My foot also got hurt.

498
00:40:12,165 --> 00:40:13,365
Anywhere else that hurts?

499
00:40:14,925 --> 00:40:16,845
No, I don't mean it like that.

500
00:40:18,685 --> 00:40:20,125
It's nothing major.

501
00:40:20,205 --> 00:40:21,285
It'll be fine by tomorrow.

502
00:40:21,765 --> 00:40:23,485
You can just do your own thing.

503
00:40:23,765 --> 00:40:24,605
We need to talk.

504
00:40:25,925 --> 00:40:26,805
About what?

505
00:40:27,485 --> 00:40:28,445
You worked so hard.

506
00:40:29,365 --> 00:40:32,765
In the end, you still missed
the red carpet. Do you regret it?

507
00:40:35,365 --> 00:40:39,045
Even if I knew this would happen,
I'd still do it all over again.

508
00:40:39,525 --> 00:40:41,965
Because this is a job I like.

509
00:40:43,285 --> 00:40:44,325
Has it ever occurred to you

510
00:40:44,965 --> 00:40:46,525
that if you want to be successful

511
00:40:47,325 --> 00:40:48,965
there's a great shortcut?

512
00:40:49,725 --> 00:40:52,805
Just go public with our relationship
and the media will be all over you.

513
00:40:53,365 --> 00:40:54,205
No.

514
00:40:55,245 --> 00:40:58,805
I don't want my work to be drowned out
by scandals and gossip.

515
00:40:59,085 --> 00:41:00,725
In two years, I don't want

516
00:41:00,805 --> 00:41:04,805
the news to say
that I'm just Ling Yizhou's wife.

517
00:41:12,245 --> 00:41:13,525
I can keep our marriage secret.

518
00:41:14,765 --> 00:41:17,765
Ouch... Really?

519
00:41:17,845 --> 00:41:19,005
But I have one condition.

520
00:41:20,365 --> 00:41:21,205
What is it?

521
00:41:22,525 --> 00:41:23,765
I'm always busy with work.

522
00:41:23,845 --> 00:41:27,005
To make sure we spend time together
and to fool Grandma,

523
00:41:27,565 --> 00:41:29,565
you need to have breakfast
with me every day.

524
00:41:30,925 --> 00:41:32,525
I was thinking a lot worse.

525
00:41:33,045 --> 00:41:34,045
Pinky promise.

526
00:41:47,445 --> 00:41:49,325
Don't sleep on that side tonight.

527
00:41:49,885 --> 00:41:53,965
Thank you for helping me today
and for agreeing to keep us a secret.

528
00:42:00,525 --> 00:42:02,965
Good night.
I'll leave the ointment here for you.

529
00:42:16,685 --> 00:42:19,965
Stay strong, Xia Lin.

530
00:42:21,045 --> 00:42:22,445
You must stay strong!

531
00:42:57,085 --> 00:42:58,485
Can you just cut it out?

532
00:42:58,565 --> 00:43:01,805
You're yelling at me.
How dare you yell at me?

533
00:43:02,245 --> 00:43:04,085
If you calm down,
I'll do whatever you want.

534
00:43:04,565 --> 00:43:05,525
Really?

535
00:43:06,045 --> 00:43:09,205
Then I want to win Best Actress.

536
00:43:09,885 --> 00:43:11,165
Try something else.

537
00:43:11,245 --> 00:43:16,165
I want... a secret marriage.

538
00:43:16,965 --> 00:43:18,325
Fine, I'll agree to that.

539
00:43:18,405 --> 00:43:23,005
Also... I want to change clothes.

540
00:43:23,365 --> 00:43:24,525
-I'll get Ms. Huang.
-No!

541
00:43:24,605 --> 00:43:28,565
I want to change right now.

542
00:43:28,645 --> 00:43:30,085
No... Don't...

543
00:44:58,165 --> 00:45:00,085

544
00:45:00,605 --> 00:45:03,725
I want to bring a dog home.
Just for a few days.

545
00:45:04,005 --> 00:45:04,845
No way.

546
00:45:05,725 --> 00:45:07,805
My friend needs me
to look after a dog for two days.

547
00:45:08,445 --> 00:45:10,805
Could you help me persuade Ling Yizhou?

548
00:45:11,405 --> 00:45:13,245
If I hadn't gone abroad two years ago,

549
00:45:13,805 --> 00:45:17,525
I'd be married to you right now,
wouldn't I?

550
00:45:19,165 --> 00:45:20,085
An Ran.

551
00:45:21,125 --> 00:45:23,165
Some things in this world
are destined to be.

552
00:45:23,765 --> 00:45:26,805
No matter how many times you reset it,
the results will still be the same.
