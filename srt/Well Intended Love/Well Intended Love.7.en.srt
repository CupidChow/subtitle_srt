1
00:00:13,085 --> 00:00:16,885
In the whole world, the animal
that's best at desertion is mankind.

2
00:00:16,965 --> 00:00:19,605
They abandon their lovers, their family,

3
00:00:19,965 --> 00:00:21,525
and even their own children.

4
00:00:22,405 --> 00:00:23,405
Women...

5
00:00:25,125 --> 00:00:27,005
What do they like?

6
00:00:27,365 --> 00:00:29,445
I don't really have female friends, so...

7
00:00:29,885 --> 00:00:31,325
You seem to know Jia Fei well.

8
00:00:33,765 --> 00:00:36,205
You can't go this far
just because you know my secret.

9
00:00:36,565 --> 00:00:39,485
I just hate seeing you whine all the time.

10
00:00:39,845 --> 00:00:41,445
It's not like the entire world owes you.

11
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:45,365
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

12
00:02:12,485 --> 00:02:15,484
EPISODE 7

13
00:02:16,325 --> 00:02:20,045
OPERATING ROOM

14
00:02:31,965 --> 00:02:32,805
How is he doing?

15
00:02:32,885 --> 00:02:34,165
We don't know yet.

16
00:02:34,845 --> 00:02:37,845
Don't worry, Linlin.
I'm sure Yizhou will be fine.

17
00:02:37,925 --> 00:02:38,925
What happened?

18
00:02:39,005 --> 00:02:40,645
It was a hit and run.

19
00:02:41,005 --> 00:02:43,605
The driver was drunk
and has been arrested by the police.

20
00:02:43,685 --> 00:02:45,805
Miss An helped out a lot.

21
00:02:46,765 --> 00:02:50,325
I saw it happen on my way
to Gangdong Tower.

22
00:02:51,365 --> 00:02:52,405
Thank you, An Ran.

23
00:02:53,005 --> 00:02:54,125
Of course.

24
00:02:57,885 --> 00:02:59,285
How is he, doctor?

25
00:02:59,525 --> 00:03:02,845
Director Ling has a minor concussion.

26
00:03:02,925 --> 00:03:05,765
His right foot is fractured,
but that's about it, luckily.

27
00:03:06,285 --> 00:03:07,965
He just needs some time to recover.

28
00:03:09,365 --> 00:03:10,765
Can I go in and see him?

29
00:03:11,365 --> 00:03:13,445
Yes. Director Ling is in his room now.

30
00:03:16,285 --> 00:03:18,885
Miss An, the police need
to ask you some questions.

31
00:03:20,885 --> 00:03:23,125
Take good care of Yizhou, Linlin.

32
00:03:23,205 --> 00:03:25,045
Let me know as soon he wakes up.

33
00:03:38,405 --> 00:03:39,445
Did you know

34
00:03:39,885 --> 00:03:42,005
how shocked I was when I got the call?

35
00:03:42,485 --> 00:03:43,685
Thank goodness you're OK.

36
00:03:44,765 --> 00:03:46,325
You wanted to tell me something.

37
00:03:47,725 --> 00:03:50,725
Did you have something to do
with the cancellation of the show?

38
00:03:56,845 --> 00:03:58,525
What a handsome face.

39
00:03:59,285 --> 00:04:01,245
Why do you have to be so domineering?

40
00:04:09,045 --> 00:04:10,085
Hey.

41
00:04:14,205 --> 00:04:15,765
The doctor said you need to stay still.

42
00:04:16,285 --> 00:04:18,645
You tore your cartilage. You need to rest.

43
00:04:20,125 --> 00:04:20,965
Who are you?

44
00:04:22,165 --> 00:04:23,005
Ling!

45
00:04:25,404 --> 00:04:27,205
Ling. Are you OK?

46
00:04:27,285 --> 00:04:29,085
Does your head hurt? How's your foot?

47
00:04:30,205 --> 00:04:31,045
I'm fine.

48
00:04:31,325 --> 00:04:32,685
Be gentle, OK?

49
00:04:32,765 --> 00:04:34,765
He's a patient. You're going to hurt him.

50
00:04:36,085 --> 00:04:37,245
Get out.

51
00:04:37,325 --> 00:04:39,205
Fine, I won't touch you.

52
00:04:39,885 --> 00:04:40,925
I meant you.

53
00:04:44,285 --> 00:04:45,125
Get out.

54
00:04:46,285 --> 00:04:47,285
What did you say?

55
00:04:51,165 --> 00:04:52,725
Don't make me say it a third time.

56
00:04:53,205 --> 00:04:54,925
Otherwise you'll lose your job.

57
00:04:57,325 --> 00:04:58,205
What job?

58
00:04:59,805 --> 00:05:00,725
Are you OK?

59
00:05:04,405 --> 00:05:05,565
What's your name?

60
00:05:07,405 --> 00:05:08,845
Xia Lin.

61
00:05:12,165 --> 00:05:13,125
Xia Lin, is it?

62
00:05:15,165 --> 00:05:17,085
You. Fire her for me.

63
00:05:20,365 --> 00:05:21,365
Right now.

64
00:05:26,005 --> 00:05:28,965
This often occurs
due to severe impact to the brain.

65
00:05:29,285 --> 00:05:31,805
Blood clots can lead to nerve compression.

66
00:05:32,685 --> 00:05:33,965
But the strange thing is

67
00:05:34,045 --> 00:05:36,725
no blood clots were found
in Mr. Ling's brain.

68
00:05:39,045 --> 00:05:42,085
How did he just lose
two years of memory then?

69
00:05:42,725 --> 00:05:44,605
The brain is a complex structure.

70
00:05:44,685 --> 00:05:47,565
More tests need to be done
to identify the cause.

71
00:05:52,965 --> 00:05:53,805
Are you OK?

72
00:05:54,805 --> 00:05:55,685
I'm fine.

73
00:05:55,765 --> 00:05:56,685
Mrs. Ling.

74
00:05:56,925 --> 00:05:59,645
Director Lin doesn't have
any other injuries.

75
00:06:00,045 --> 00:06:01,845
He's been very fortunate.

76
00:06:02,765 --> 00:06:05,925
His amnesia might just be
a reaction to shock.

77
00:06:06,005 --> 00:06:08,725
Perhaps he'll be normal by tomorrow.

78
00:06:09,205 --> 00:06:10,685
I know that, doctor.

79
00:06:11,045 --> 00:06:12,285
What I want to know is

80
00:06:12,925 --> 00:06:15,445
can amnesia change his temperament?

81
00:06:15,885 --> 00:06:17,805
He suddenly became so mean.

82
00:06:20,205 --> 00:06:22,325
That's the normal Ling Yizhou.

83
00:06:23,005 --> 00:06:25,965
He wasn't acting like himself before this.

84
00:06:27,045 --> 00:06:30,165
You can take this opportunity
to get to know him.

85
00:06:38,725 --> 00:06:41,845
<i>How dare you flirt right in front of me?</i>

86
00:06:44,325 --> 00:06:46,445
Linlin. Chu Yan. What did the doctor say?

87
00:06:47,045 --> 00:06:49,445
The doctor says his brain is fine.

88
00:06:50,085 --> 00:06:53,125
His memory loss is
just a reaction to shock.

89
00:06:53,485 --> 00:06:54,365
Glad to hear that.

90
00:06:55,165 --> 00:06:57,205
Linlin, I didn't mean it like that.

91
00:06:58,365 --> 00:07:00,805
As long as he's fine, it's OK.

92
00:07:01,325 --> 00:07:03,845
Maybe he'll get his memory back tomorrow.

93
00:07:05,205 --> 00:07:07,365
Want some fruit? I'll go get some for you.

94
00:07:21,445 --> 00:07:24,165
Ling, I'm sorry
I haven't told you this yet.

95
00:07:24,245 --> 00:07:26,365
During the period of time
that you don't remember,

96
00:07:26,445 --> 00:07:29,045
you've unfortunately made
a major life decision.

97
00:07:30,485 --> 00:07:32,125
Let me introduce you.

98
00:07:32,205 --> 00:07:33,685
-This is your--
-I know.

99
00:07:35,045 --> 00:07:35,885
Xia Lin, right?

100
00:07:37,445 --> 00:07:38,325
I'm sorry.

101
00:07:38,405 --> 00:07:41,325
Right now, to me, you're just a stranger.

102
00:07:45,565 --> 00:07:46,405
What's your point?

103
00:07:47,165 --> 00:07:49,405
Before I get my memory back,

104
00:07:49,485 --> 00:07:52,885
I hope we can live independently
and not interfere with each other.

105
00:07:53,645 --> 00:07:56,725
I'm sure you must be very good at this,
or else I wouldn't have married you.

106
00:08:00,885 --> 00:08:01,725
Any questions?

107
00:08:03,365 --> 00:08:05,445
I've never interfered with your life,

108
00:08:05,525 --> 00:08:08,685
but you've been interfering with mine.

109
00:08:11,925 --> 00:08:12,925
I won't do that anymore.

110
00:08:16,045 --> 00:08:16,885
You can go now.

111
00:08:25,285 --> 00:08:26,325
Ling.

112
00:08:26,405 --> 00:08:29,045
Your change is so abrupt.
I don't know how to react.

113
00:08:29,525 --> 00:08:32,725
Yizhou is still recovering.
We need to be more understanding.

114
00:08:32,805 --> 00:08:34,045
Fine.

115
00:08:34,125 --> 00:08:35,725
You care about him the most, OK?

116
00:08:37,684 --> 00:08:38,765
Here, Yizhou.

117
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:42,325
-Mrs. Ling.
-Mr. Wen.

118
00:08:42,965 --> 00:08:44,845
-Have you made arrangements for Yang Tong?
-Yes.

119
00:08:44,924 --> 00:08:46,885
I sent Ms. Huang to keep Grandma company.

120
00:08:47,845 --> 00:08:49,805
Good. We shouldn't let her worry.

121
00:08:50,365 --> 00:08:51,845
By the way, what are you doing here?

122
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:53,925
Isn't Feifei moving today?

123
00:08:54,005 --> 00:08:55,365
I hope you didn't forget.

124
00:08:55,645 --> 00:08:57,125
The accident happened so suddenly.

125
00:08:57,205 --> 00:08:58,045
Mr. Ling...

126
00:08:58,645 --> 00:08:59,965
He's fine. Don't worry.

127
00:09:00,205 --> 00:09:01,205
Go help Feifei.

128
00:09:01,285 --> 00:09:03,005
Mrs. Ling,
you're not staying here with him?

129
00:09:03,085 --> 00:09:04,845
Miss An is with him. I'm not needed here.

130
00:09:10,365 --> 00:09:13,085
<i>Mr. Ling, I can't help you this time.</i>

131
00:09:14,285 --> 00:09:16,685
ENDLESS MUSIC KUGOU

132
00:09:22,205 --> 00:09:24,685
Play <i>Love You</i> by Chu Yan.

133
00:09:34,365 --> 00:09:36,005
Sorry I'm late.

134
00:09:36,445 --> 00:09:39,165
I'm surprised you even showed up.

135
00:09:40,565 --> 00:09:41,405
I'm so sorry.

136
00:09:43,365 --> 00:09:46,445
I know. You don't want me
to move in, right?

137
00:09:46,525 --> 00:09:48,445
That's why you're deliberately late.

138
00:09:48,965 --> 00:09:50,125
That's not true, Miss Jia.

139
00:09:50,725 --> 00:09:52,685
Mr. Ling had a car accident today.

140
00:09:53,045 --> 00:09:54,045
What?

141
00:09:54,405 --> 00:09:56,045
He called me his sweetheart yesterday.

142
00:09:56,125 --> 00:09:58,005
Now he wakes up
and can't recognize me anymore.

143
00:09:58,085 --> 00:10:00,925
He called me a stranger
and he was mean to me.

144
00:10:02,805 --> 00:10:03,805
Linlin.

145
00:10:03,885 --> 00:10:05,005
-Feifei.
-Way to go, my dear.

146
00:10:05,445 --> 00:10:06,805
Great minds think alike.

147
00:10:08,645 --> 00:10:10,005
What were you thinking?

148
00:10:10,325 --> 00:10:13,205
You can get a divorce!
Wen Li told me what happened.

149
00:10:13,525 --> 00:10:15,245
Mr. Ling lost his memory, right?

150
00:10:15,325 --> 00:10:19,205
This is the best time
to annul your marriage contract.

151
00:10:19,725 --> 00:10:21,485
Get a divorce?

152
00:10:22,765 --> 00:10:25,205
You'll become a divorced lady,

153
00:10:25,725 --> 00:10:26,845
but that's OK.

154
00:10:26,925 --> 00:10:28,485
You're young and beautiful.

155
00:10:28,845 --> 00:10:31,125
You can easily find
someone who truly loves you.

156
00:10:31,525 --> 00:10:34,445
Isn't that better than wasting two years

157
00:10:34,525 --> 00:10:36,685
on someone who likes men?

158
00:10:37,325 --> 00:10:38,925
I got your back. Need help packing?

159
00:10:39,005 --> 00:10:39,965
Here.

160
00:10:40,045 --> 00:10:42,485
I don't want a divorce.

161
00:10:44,165 --> 00:10:45,005
Why not?

162
00:10:45,365 --> 00:10:47,245
Ling Yizhou isn't gay.

163
00:10:47,685 --> 00:10:48,525
What?

164
00:10:48,965 --> 00:10:50,845
Remember when you had me test him?

165
00:10:51,525 --> 00:10:54,805
Turns out he's totally straight.

166
00:10:56,565 --> 00:10:59,805
I need a moment to let that sink in.

167
00:11:01,365 --> 00:11:03,685
Wait. Then why are you packing?

168
00:11:04,045 --> 00:11:05,485
You're not leaving him.

169
00:11:05,565 --> 00:11:08,125
I'm going to stay
at the hospital with him tomorrow.

170
00:11:08,845 --> 00:11:09,685
What?

171
00:11:10,525 --> 00:11:11,685
You have no idea.

172
00:11:11,765 --> 00:11:15,565
He said he wanted us to live separately
and leave each other alone.

173
00:11:16,005 --> 00:11:18,965
He just wants me to leave
so he can flirt with An Ran.

174
00:11:19,605 --> 00:11:20,845
I won't let him have his way.

175
00:11:21,645 --> 00:11:24,525
So you're not leaving him

176
00:11:25,325 --> 00:11:27,285
and you're staying
at the hospital with him?

177
00:11:27,765 --> 00:11:32,765
He's suffering from memory loss.
It's unkind to get a divorce now.

178
00:11:33,685 --> 00:11:35,405
What if when he gets his memory back,

179
00:11:36,045 --> 00:11:38,245
he says I breached the contract
and asks me to pay?

180
00:11:38,325 --> 00:11:39,485
I'd go broke.

181
00:11:42,125 --> 00:11:43,325
I have to pack now.

182
00:11:44,845 --> 00:11:47,805
<i>It's scary when a woman lies to herself.</i>

183
00:11:48,685 --> 00:11:50,885
Let me help you, Mrs. Ling.

184
00:12:18,005 --> 00:12:19,245
Come watch TV with me.

185
00:13:10,965 --> 00:13:13,125
<i>Ling Yizhou, you're such a jerk.</i>

186
00:13:14,605 --> 00:13:16,685
<i>I think I'm in love with you.</i>

187
00:13:35,325 --> 00:13:36,325
You're up?

188
00:13:41,325 --> 00:13:42,925
If you like him,

189
00:13:43,365 --> 00:13:44,845
I think you should fight for him.

190
00:13:47,245 --> 00:13:48,405
How do I fight?

191
00:13:49,725 --> 00:13:51,285
He doesn't even remember me.

192
00:13:52,205 --> 00:13:56,605
That's why your priority is
to make him remember you.

193
00:13:57,445 --> 00:13:58,645
I want to do that, too.

194
00:14:00,685 --> 00:14:02,765
But I don't know what to do.

195
00:14:04,885 --> 00:14:06,205
You silly girl.

196
00:14:06,685 --> 00:14:10,765
I'll show you how to get Mr. Ling.

197
00:14:16,125 --> 00:14:20,645
We shall uphold
the following three principles.

198
00:14:21,205 --> 00:14:22,845
First, commitment.

199
00:14:23,365 --> 00:14:25,165
Second, be shameless.

200
00:14:25,605 --> 00:14:27,565
<i>Third, commitment to being shameless.</i>

201
00:14:27,845 --> 00:14:30,365
<i>We need to be reserved, yet bold.</i>

202
00:14:30,445 --> 00:14:31,925
<i>Remain reserved, yet passionate.</i>

203
00:14:32,125 --> 00:14:33,085
<i>Most importantly,</i>

204
00:14:33,165 --> 00:14:34,645
<i>you have to trust yourself.</i>

205
00:14:35,805 --> 00:14:38,765
You can do it, Xia Lin. Let's go.

206
00:15:15,165 --> 00:15:16,725
Who was that who just left?

207
00:15:18,445 --> 00:15:19,365
None of your business.

208
00:15:21,165 --> 00:15:22,805
I made chicken soup for you.

209
00:15:22,885 --> 00:15:24,525
It smells good. I'll serve you some.

210
00:15:24,605 --> 00:15:25,725
It's fine, I've eaten.

211
00:15:25,805 --> 00:15:28,365
But it's really good.
It took me three hours to make it.

212
00:15:28,445 --> 00:15:29,765
-Try it.
-I said no.

213
00:15:34,325 --> 00:15:35,205
Are you OK?

214
00:15:35,925 --> 00:15:37,965
No. It's hot.

215
00:15:40,725 --> 00:15:42,925
But if you drink it...

216
00:15:44,485 --> 00:15:45,685
it will have been worthwhile.

217
00:16:08,005 --> 00:16:09,845
Don't you have anything important to do?

218
00:16:10,805 --> 00:16:12,925
My priority now is to be with you.

219
00:16:28,645 --> 00:16:29,725
Can you leave now?

220
00:16:30,085 --> 00:16:31,405
I just got here.

221
00:16:31,485 --> 00:16:32,725
You're disrupting my work.

222
00:16:33,045 --> 00:16:34,925
But I didn't say anything.

223
00:16:35,245 --> 00:16:37,365
I don't like having someone around
when I'm working.

224
00:16:37,605 --> 00:16:39,645
Liar. You used to enjoy it so much.

225
00:16:41,925 --> 00:16:42,805
Xia Lin.

226
00:16:43,645 --> 00:16:46,805
Right now,
I don't have any feelings for you.

227
00:16:46,885 --> 00:16:47,885
I know that.

228
00:16:48,245 --> 00:16:49,965
That's why I'm working on it.

229
00:16:50,925 --> 00:16:52,245
An Ran told me

230
00:16:52,325 --> 00:16:55,165
we haven't known each other for long,
and we got married abruptly.

231
00:16:55,245 --> 00:16:56,805
We don't have a solid foundation.

232
00:16:57,125 --> 00:16:58,965
I won't mind
if you don't come to the hospital.

233
00:16:59,365 --> 00:17:01,605
I can't do that.
Who will take care of you?

234
00:17:01,685 --> 00:17:03,285
-I packed my stuff.
-I have a caretaker.

235
00:17:06,405 --> 00:17:07,965
Caretakers are not family.

236
00:17:08,045 --> 00:17:09,525
There will be some inconveniences.

237
00:17:09,604 --> 00:17:11,565
What if you want to use the bathroom?

238
00:17:13,565 --> 00:17:14,965
I won't trouble you.

239
00:17:24,045 --> 00:17:24,965
What are you doing?

240
00:17:25,045 --> 00:17:27,285
Let me help you.
She won't get here fast enough.

241
00:17:27,565 --> 00:17:29,725
What if the esteemed Director Ling--

242
00:17:29,805 --> 00:17:30,885
Who said I need to go?

243
00:17:33,324 --> 00:17:35,365
Be quiet and help me up.

244
00:17:36,005 --> 00:17:36,845
Here.

245
00:17:39,285 --> 00:17:40,205
Take it slow.

246
00:17:44,685 --> 00:17:45,685
It's fine.

247
00:18:00,485 --> 00:18:01,565
Here are your slippers.

248
00:18:02,765 --> 00:18:03,805
Sorry.

249
00:18:06,485 --> 00:18:07,525
I'll show you around.

250
00:18:09,725 --> 00:18:13,125
This is the kitchen. This is the bathroom.

251
00:18:14,765 --> 00:18:17,245
This is your room.
I just changed the sheets.

252
00:18:21,605 --> 00:18:23,765
You like pink?

253
00:18:27,885 --> 00:18:29,965
There's food in the fridge.
You can use the kitchen.

254
00:18:31,005 --> 00:18:32,445
This is the downstairs entrance key.

255
00:18:32,525 --> 00:18:33,805
OK. Thank you.

256
00:18:35,845 --> 00:18:37,205
You can get back to work.

257
00:18:37,285 --> 00:18:39,565
I'll take care of the rest.

258
00:18:40,085 --> 00:18:41,045
Thank you.

259
00:18:43,085 --> 00:18:45,045
-See you tonight.
-Bye!

260
00:18:52,445 --> 00:18:54,325
Wow.

261
00:18:58,325 --> 00:18:59,445
A rabbit?

262
00:19:08,565 --> 00:19:10,725
Everything is pink.

263
00:19:11,285 --> 00:19:15,565
Oh, my God. So girly.

264
00:19:22,205 --> 00:19:23,165
Take it slow.

265
00:19:30,765 --> 00:19:31,845
Are you OK?

266
00:19:40,965 --> 00:19:41,845
Yizhou.

267
00:19:44,125 --> 00:19:45,045
I lost my balance.

268
00:19:46,805 --> 00:19:47,645
I'll help you.

269
00:19:48,885 --> 00:19:50,085
I'll help him.

270
00:19:51,045 --> 00:19:52,005
It's OK, An Ran.

271
00:19:52,325 --> 00:19:54,045
You're holding something. She can help me.

272
00:20:01,285 --> 00:20:03,765
Yizhou, I made soup for you.

273
00:20:04,125 --> 00:20:07,485
It's my first time making soup.
It might not be good.

274
00:20:08,845 --> 00:20:10,045
He's had soup already.

275
00:20:11,085 --> 00:20:12,485
But it took me a long time to make.

276
00:20:12,845 --> 00:20:13,685
I'll try it.

277
00:20:18,125 --> 00:20:19,125
Careful.

278
00:20:24,925 --> 00:20:25,965
It's good.

279
00:20:26,445 --> 00:20:29,005
If you like it,
I'll make it for you every day.

280
00:20:32,405 --> 00:20:35,245
I can do that. You should go back to work.

281
00:20:35,925 --> 00:20:37,085
I'll take care of Yizhou.

282
00:20:38,725 --> 00:20:42,045
Linlin, you probably don't have
much time these days.

283
00:20:43,245 --> 00:20:44,085
What do you mean?

284
00:20:44,405 --> 00:20:48,365
There's gossip about you and Chu Yan
all over the Internet.

285
00:20:48,885 --> 00:20:50,045
You've seen it, haven't you?

286
00:20:50,285 --> 00:20:52,525
Gossip? That's impossible.

287
00:21:03,125 --> 00:21:05,845
"Chu Yan on a late-night date at a hotel?"

288
00:21:06,805 --> 00:21:09,365
"Intimate interaction
with his possible girlfriend."

289
00:21:11,165 --> 00:21:13,365
They must be out of their minds,
making this up.

290
00:21:24,205 --> 00:21:25,045
Hello?

291
00:21:25,325 --> 00:21:27,565
<i>Xia Lin, come to the office immediately.</i>

292
00:21:30,205 --> 00:21:31,045
OK.

293
00:21:40,845 --> 00:21:42,765
Is that you and Chu Yan in the photo?

294
00:21:44,445 --> 00:21:45,485
Yes.

295
00:21:45,965 --> 00:21:47,045
When did you start dating?

296
00:21:47,285 --> 00:21:49,765
It's a misunderstanding. We're not dating.

297
00:21:50,285 --> 00:21:54,285
The media made up the story.

298
00:21:54,725 --> 00:21:57,205
Why was he looking at you so lovingly?

299
00:21:57,925 --> 00:22:01,645
It's his eyes.
He looks at dogs the same way.

300
00:22:03,365 --> 00:22:04,485
Xia Lin.

301
00:22:04,565 --> 00:22:06,845
I know you're eager to get more publicity,

302
00:22:07,325 --> 00:22:10,765
but it's a bad idea to be seen
with Chu Yan in the gossip columns.

303
00:22:11,285 --> 00:22:12,925
His background is well known.

304
00:22:13,245 --> 00:22:16,165
The Chu family will not allow him
to get involved with any actress.

305
00:22:16,685 --> 00:22:18,125
It was really a misunderstanding.

306
00:22:18,205 --> 00:22:19,285
How can I explain this?

307
00:22:19,765 --> 00:22:22,245
Chu Yan's movie will be
released next month.

308
00:22:22,325 --> 00:22:24,605
Starting rumors at this time
is no good for the box office.

309
00:22:25,205 --> 00:22:27,685
The company has decided not to respond.

310
00:22:27,765 --> 00:22:29,565
We'll just let this thing blow over.

311
00:22:30,045 --> 00:22:30,885
Do you understand?

312
00:22:33,005 --> 00:22:33,885
I understand.

313
00:22:36,045 --> 00:22:36,925
What are you doing?

314
00:22:37,965 --> 00:22:40,085
Let go of me. What are you doing?

315
00:22:40,445 --> 00:22:41,645
What if people see us?

316
00:22:44,285 --> 00:22:46,405
So what? We're not dating.

317
00:22:47,005 --> 00:22:50,165
This is my first time in the gossip column
and it's with you. Terrible luck.

318
00:22:50,925 --> 00:22:53,045
You think I want to be associated
with a married woman?

319
00:22:53,125 --> 00:22:56,165
You're the married woman.
I'm a young and pretty lady.

320
00:22:56,445 --> 00:22:58,485
I don't want to be associated
with a playboy like you.

321
00:22:59,605 --> 00:23:00,445
Shrew.

322
00:23:00,725 --> 00:23:01,805
Womanizer.

323
00:23:01,885 --> 00:23:03,325
What do you want?

324
00:23:05,365 --> 00:23:06,605
I want to get rid of the rumor.

325
00:23:07,405 --> 00:23:10,405
The company said they won't respond.

326
00:23:10,725 --> 00:23:12,645
I don't care about
the company's crappy decision.

327
00:23:13,045 --> 00:23:14,765
If you don't want
to get iced out by my dad,

328
00:23:15,205 --> 00:23:16,525
you'd better do what I say.

329
00:23:18,165 --> 00:23:20,045
What should I do then?

330
00:23:22,165 --> 00:23:23,205
Post a statement on Weibo.

331
00:23:24,085 --> 00:23:25,125
That's it?

332
00:23:26,005 --> 00:23:28,485
You want me to call a press conference?

333
00:23:30,245 --> 00:23:32,645
Fine. I'll do it.

334
00:23:37,805 --> 00:23:38,805
You're not posting?

335
00:23:39,325 --> 00:23:41,645
I just did. You're so slow.

336
00:23:47,965 --> 00:23:48,805
"Cut it out!"

337
00:23:50,005 --> 00:23:51,685
That's very vague.

338
00:23:51,765 --> 00:23:53,485
A three-word statement?

339
00:23:57,165 --> 00:23:58,925
What should I say?

340
00:24:08,965 --> 00:24:10,525
WOODEN HORSE:
THESE PEOPLE ARE CLUELESS

341
00:24:10,605 --> 00:24:11,725
So immature.

342
00:24:16,765 --> 00:24:17,605
Hello.

343
00:24:19,285 --> 00:24:21,045
I bought all this. Help yourself.

344
00:24:25,805 --> 00:24:27,085
This is all you eat?

345
00:24:27,925 --> 00:24:29,205
I have different flavors.

346
00:24:32,805 --> 00:24:33,725
I'll cook something.

347
00:24:51,285 --> 00:24:55,565
This music is too old-school.
Try young people's music.

348
00:25:01,725 --> 00:25:03,085
KUGOU PANDORA SPEAKER CONTROL

349
00:25:03,165 --> 00:25:04,245
KUGOU PANDORA

350
00:25:33,805 --> 00:25:36,205
I had no idea you could cook.

351
00:25:38,245 --> 00:25:40,845
You have many skills, Mr. Wen.

352
00:25:42,245 --> 00:25:44,685
Is there anything you can't do?

353
00:25:46,845 --> 00:25:47,885
Have a baby.

354
00:25:52,445 --> 00:25:55,165
That is pretty difficult.

355
00:25:55,765 --> 00:25:59,565
Maybe things will change
with technological advances.

356
00:25:59,645 --> 00:26:02,165
-Don't be discouraged.
-Why would I be discouraged?

357
00:26:04,005 --> 00:26:06,165
Wait a moment. Let me get something.

358
00:26:12,365 --> 00:26:13,525
THE DIAMOND SUTRA

359
00:26:13,605 --> 00:26:14,485
You can have it.

360
00:26:15,725 --> 00:26:18,965
My friend gave this to me for meditation.

361
00:26:19,205 --> 00:26:20,805
Buddhism speaks of the seven sufferings.

362
00:26:20,885 --> 00:26:22,565
The worst is not getting what you want.

363
00:26:23,085 --> 00:26:26,085
Love cannot be forced.

364
00:26:26,365 --> 00:26:28,965
There are many lovable people
in the world.

365
00:26:29,045 --> 00:26:31,205
There's plenty of fish in the sea.
Don't get hung up.

366
00:26:33,205 --> 00:26:35,165
No need to thank me.

367
00:26:35,245 --> 00:26:36,845
-Let's eat.
What are you talking about?

368
00:26:38,685 --> 00:26:39,765
Nothing.

369
00:26:39,845 --> 00:26:41,245
Have some vegetables.

370
00:26:42,965 --> 00:26:44,005
Let's eat.

371
00:26:48,045 --> 00:26:49,125
Dig in.

372
00:26:53,165 --> 00:26:54,045
Go ahead.

373
00:26:59,205 --> 00:27:00,205
Pidan.

374
00:27:01,365 --> 00:27:04,645
I've got over 1,000 comments
for the first time.

375
00:27:05,965 --> 00:27:07,485
They're all hating on me.

376
00:27:08,365 --> 00:27:09,765
I wish you could speak.

377
00:27:10,885 --> 00:27:13,085
Then I'd have someone that listens to me.

378
00:27:16,805 --> 00:27:17,885
Xia Lin.

379
00:27:18,285 --> 00:27:19,285
Nan.

380
00:27:21,725 --> 00:27:23,685
I haven't thanked you for last time.

381
00:27:24,765 --> 00:27:27,285
I just made some food for you.
It was no trouble.

382
00:27:28,805 --> 00:27:31,885
It was the first time
someone made congee for me.

383
00:27:33,365 --> 00:27:37,725
Really? What did your parents do
when you got sick?

384
00:27:39,965 --> 00:27:41,285
They were both too busy at work.

385
00:27:42,845 --> 00:27:43,925
They had no time for me.

386
00:27:46,805 --> 00:27:47,685
Enough about me.

387
00:27:48,485 --> 00:27:51,005
Is something bothering you?

388
00:27:51,085 --> 00:27:52,325
You don't look very happy.

389
00:27:54,245 --> 00:27:55,605
Is it that obvious?

390
00:28:00,845 --> 00:28:02,085
Actually,

391
00:28:02,805 --> 00:28:05,925
my friend's husband had a car accident.

392
00:28:06,765 --> 00:28:08,365
He doesn't remember her anymore.

393
00:28:09,285 --> 00:28:11,845
Also, he's become close
with another woman.

394
00:28:14,245 --> 00:28:15,565
Why am I telling you this?

395
00:28:16,005 --> 00:28:19,605
It sounds like a TV show script.

396
00:28:20,405 --> 00:28:21,285
It's OK.

397
00:28:21,845 --> 00:28:23,805
I'm glad you shared it with me.

398
00:28:24,645 --> 00:28:26,365
If I can help your friend
with her problem,

399
00:28:26,765 --> 00:28:29,245
then I can return your favor.

400
00:28:30,165 --> 00:28:32,085
If we keep thanking each other,

401
00:28:32,925 --> 00:28:35,565
we'll just owe each other
more and more favors.

402
00:28:37,085 --> 00:28:41,005
Will your friend's husband
get his memory back?

403
00:28:44,165 --> 00:28:46,165
The doctor said they can't be sure.

404
00:28:46,765 --> 00:28:48,365
Maybe he will...

405
00:28:49,085 --> 00:28:50,445
Maybe he...

406
00:28:54,285 --> 00:28:55,525
What does your friend think?

407
00:28:57,645 --> 00:29:01,085
Her husband detests her now.

408
00:29:01,925 --> 00:29:03,285
She's confused.

409
00:29:03,845 --> 00:29:05,285
She doesn't know what to do.

410
00:29:09,765 --> 00:29:13,765
Human relationships
are built upon memories.

411
00:29:14,685 --> 00:29:15,925
If the memories are gone,

412
00:29:16,685 --> 00:29:18,285
the relationships will fade away, too.

413
00:29:19,405 --> 00:29:22,325
It may be hard for her to accept,

414
00:29:22,845 --> 00:29:24,725
but if she doesn't want to live in pain,

415
00:29:25,725 --> 00:29:26,805
she needs to let go.

416
00:29:31,605 --> 00:29:34,845
Are you OK? That was just my opinion.

417
00:29:36,085 --> 00:29:37,325
You're right.

418
00:29:37,885 --> 00:29:40,285
Human relationships
are built upon memories.

419
00:29:41,165 --> 00:29:42,885
But even if we lose past memories,

420
00:29:42,965 --> 00:29:44,325
we can still create new memories.

421
00:29:45,245 --> 00:29:46,325
Thank you, Nan.

422
00:29:46,405 --> 00:29:47,845
You just gave me a wake-up call.

423
00:29:48,165 --> 00:29:49,925
I'm leaving now. My treat next time.

424
00:29:52,085 --> 00:29:53,765
Come on.

425
00:30:33,565 --> 00:30:37,085
THIRTY-SIX WAYS TO GET A GUY

426
00:30:37,165 --> 00:30:40,205
STRATEGY ONE: SWEET TALK

427
00:30:43,445 --> 00:30:46,405
The first time I saw you...

428
00:30:47,125 --> 00:30:49,645
I got a fever.

429
00:30:50,565 --> 00:30:51,925
Do you know why?

430
00:30:53,685 --> 00:30:56,165
You really want to know, right?

431
00:30:56,845 --> 00:30:58,085
It's because...

432
00:30:58,165 --> 00:31:01,445
the temperature of love at first sight
is 101.5 degrees Fahrenheit.

433
00:31:03,205 --> 00:31:04,485
Shut up.

434
00:31:07,925 --> 00:31:12,005
STRATEGY TWO: CATER TO HIS TASTE

435
00:31:16,085 --> 00:31:17,325
Do you like it?

436
00:31:18,125 --> 00:31:22,205
I arranged all this for you.

437
00:31:28,405 --> 00:31:29,245
Get out.

438
00:31:29,685 --> 00:31:31,525
Get your stuff and get out.

439
00:31:38,605 --> 00:31:41,965
STRATEGY THREE: FEIGNING MISERY

440
00:31:48,285 --> 00:31:51,165
JERK!!!

441
00:31:54,165 --> 00:31:56,485
This crappy book is useless.

442
00:31:59,805 --> 00:32:02,165
<i>Thirty-six Ways to Get a Guy</i>? So lame.

443
00:32:03,845 --> 00:32:04,685
Leave me alone.

444
00:32:06,125 --> 00:32:07,965
Stay away.
I don't want another photo with you.

445
00:32:08,245 --> 00:32:11,125
Don't worry.
It's my loss if we get photographed.

446
00:32:11,965 --> 00:32:13,965
Ling hasn't accepted you yet?

447
00:32:14,885 --> 00:32:17,485
Well, you fooled him once.

448
00:32:17,805 --> 00:32:20,085
-How could he be fooled again?
-You...

449
00:32:23,805 --> 00:32:26,645
If you dare touch me,
my 50 million fans will go after you.

450
00:32:28,885 --> 00:32:30,885
Do you like cats or dogs?

451
00:32:31,565 --> 00:32:32,405
Cats.

452
00:32:33,165 --> 00:32:34,365
Meow.

453
00:32:36,525 --> 00:32:37,605
What the heck was that?

454
00:32:37,685 --> 00:32:40,085
That's so lame.
No wonder Ling isn't taking the bait.

455
00:32:40,365 --> 00:32:41,485
I don't need your advice.

456
00:32:42,325 --> 00:32:44,085
If you don't step up your game,

457
00:32:44,165 --> 00:32:45,725
someone else will win Ling's heart.

458
00:32:46,205 --> 00:32:47,965
-Meow.
-I didn't say meow.

459
00:32:48,325 --> 00:32:50,245
I said it four times.
Meow, meow, meow, meow.

460
00:32:50,605 --> 00:32:52,485
Do a pig snort. No, a pig!

461
00:32:53,765 --> 00:32:54,685
Now do a crow.

462
00:32:56,045 --> 00:32:58,885
Chu Yan and Linlin are so close.

463
00:32:59,725 --> 00:33:01,525
No wonder they got photographed.

464
00:33:21,205 --> 00:33:23,365
Your An Ran isn't here to protect you?

465
00:33:25,725 --> 00:33:28,805
Even if you think of her as your sister,

466
00:33:29,325 --> 00:33:31,325
you can't bother her
for everything, right?

467
00:33:31,685 --> 00:33:33,045
Let me know if you need anything.

468
00:33:33,485 --> 00:33:34,325
Where's Chu Yan?

469
00:33:34,685 --> 00:33:36,885
How would I know? I'm not his agent.

470
00:33:37,245 --> 00:33:40,685
I want to remind you that you're married.

471
00:33:41,365 --> 00:33:43,645
Don't let people take
misleading photos of you.

472
00:33:45,605 --> 00:33:46,885
How is that my fault?

473
00:33:47,565 --> 00:33:49,805
You mean the gossip?

474
00:33:49,885 --> 00:33:51,605
-Chu Yan and I aren't--
-Don't explain.

475
00:33:51,965 --> 00:33:53,325
I don't care at all.

476
00:33:54,765 --> 00:33:57,365
Even if you crossed the line,
I trust Chu Yan will know better.

477
00:33:57,885 --> 00:33:59,125
What are you saying?

478
00:34:01,245 --> 00:34:02,685
You still don't get what I'm saying?

479
00:34:03,925 --> 00:34:06,845
I haven't said anything
about you and An Ran getting cozy.

480
00:34:07,525 --> 00:34:08,685
Watch your words.

481
00:34:08,765 --> 00:34:10,765
You know that I see her as my sister.

482
00:34:11,045 --> 00:34:13,925
Your last name is Ling, hers is An.
What kind of sister is that?

483
00:34:14,605 --> 00:34:15,644
Then, by the same token,

484
00:34:15,724 --> 00:34:18,485
I can say Chu Yan is like my brother.

485
00:34:18,805 --> 00:34:20,405
Can you stop causing trouble?

486
00:34:20,485 --> 00:34:22,965
I'm causing trouble?
How am I causing trouble?

487
00:34:23,045 --> 00:34:23,885
Director Ling.

488
00:34:25,125 --> 00:34:26,045
Director Ling.

489
00:34:28,164 --> 00:34:30,045
Be quiet.

490
00:34:30,285 --> 00:34:32,644
Director Ling, can I come in?
It's Shuangshuang.

491
00:34:34,325 --> 00:34:35,204
Don't make a sound.

492
00:34:35,684 --> 00:34:36,565
Come in.

493
00:34:41,045 --> 00:34:43,765
Director Lin, I just found out today
that you were hospitalized.

494
00:34:44,125 --> 00:34:46,125
How are you? Are you OK?

495
00:34:46,204 --> 00:34:47,405
I'm fine.

496
00:34:47,485 --> 00:34:50,204
I thought Wen Li blocked
all news about me.

497
00:34:50,285 --> 00:34:51,204
How did you find out?

498
00:34:54,325 --> 00:34:57,285
I've been in showbiz all these years.
I have my sources.

499
00:34:59,525 --> 00:35:01,965
Don't worry. I didn't tell anyone.

500
00:35:05,205 --> 00:35:06,205
By the way,

501
00:35:06,885 --> 00:35:08,525
do you know a girl named Xia Lin?

502
00:35:08,605 --> 00:35:10,285
Xia Lin? Yeah, I do.

503
00:35:11,165 --> 00:35:14,045
Didn't I bring her along
to your company a while ago?

504
00:35:14,925 --> 00:35:16,485
Why are you mentioning her?

505
00:35:19,005 --> 00:35:21,685
I know. It's about Chu Yan, right?

506
00:35:22,285 --> 00:35:24,525
Is the gossip true?

507
00:35:28,125 --> 00:35:31,565
I'm not interested in celebrity gossip.

508
00:35:33,965 --> 00:35:34,965
I'm going to rest now.

509
00:35:38,285 --> 00:35:41,605
Get some rest. I'll come see you again.

510
00:35:51,165 --> 00:35:52,405
Get well soon.

511
00:35:59,405 --> 00:36:00,965
Let go of me.

512
00:36:01,605 --> 00:36:02,445
Let go.

513
00:36:04,525 --> 00:36:07,165
Despicable woman.
How dare you bend my finger?

514
00:36:08,885 --> 00:36:10,245
You scared me on purpose again.

515
00:36:10,325 --> 00:36:11,485
What do you mean, "again"?

516
00:36:12,685 --> 00:36:15,085
That's right. You don't remember anything.

517
00:36:17,525 --> 00:36:18,605
Why are you hiding from her?

518
00:36:20,325 --> 00:36:23,165
If you want to know, get your memory back.

519
00:36:24,165 --> 00:36:25,725
I'm tired. I'm leaving now.

520
00:36:28,085 --> 00:36:29,765
Bye.

521
00:36:30,325 --> 00:36:32,565
Take care.

522
00:36:46,805 --> 00:36:48,965
I think there's been a misunderstanding.

523
00:36:49,645 --> 00:36:51,365
I don't care what kind of person she was,

524
00:36:51,805 --> 00:36:53,045
she's mine now.

525
00:36:57,325 --> 00:37:00,805
You're the only one in the world
who can bother me, besides my grandma.

526
00:37:06,125 --> 00:37:09,685
Why are you OK with it now?

527
00:37:10,125 --> 00:37:11,285
Because compared to the dog...

528
00:37:13,045 --> 00:37:14,685
I care more about our relationship.

529
00:37:18,685 --> 00:37:19,805
Watch your words.

530
00:37:19,885 --> 00:37:21,845
You know that I see her as my sister.

531
00:37:22,125 --> 00:37:24,885
Your last name is Ling, hers is An.
What kind of sister is that?

532
00:37:25,685 --> 00:37:29,565
Then, by the same token,
I can say Chu Yan is like my brother.

533
00:37:29,925 --> 00:37:31,605
Can you stop causing trouble?

534
00:37:33,965 --> 00:37:34,805
Forget it.

535
00:37:36,845 --> 00:37:39,645
You were nice to me before.

536
00:37:40,765 --> 00:37:42,285
I won't hold a grudge against you.

537
00:37:47,965 --> 00:37:49,925
Ling, is your foot OK?

538
00:37:50,005 --> 00:37:50,845
It is.

539
00:37:59,205 --> 00:38:00,045
Mr. Wen.

540
00:38:00,405 --> 00:38:01,765
You look strange today.

541
00:38:02,125 --> 00:38:04,685
-What's the matter?
-I'm checking to see if Mrs. Ling is here.

542
00:38:06,485 --> 00:38:08,485
Maybe Linlin got up too late.

543
00:38:08,925 --> 00:38:11,885
She's an idiot, but she wouldn't forget
that Ling is getting out today.

544
00:38:12,285 --> 00:38:13,325
Let's wait for a while.

545
00:38:14,165 --> 00:38:16,765
-When did you get to know her so well?
-We're not waiting. Let's go.

546
00:38:16,845 --> 00:38:19,085
Mr. Ling. She's here.

547
00:38:31,685 --> 00:38:33,005
Hello!

548
00:38:40,205 --> 00:38:42,205
You drive like a tortoise.

549
00:38:43,445 --> 00:38:45,125
I'm here to take you home.

550
00:38:45,205 --> 00:38:46,485
No. Wen Li will drive me.

551
00:38:47,605 --> 00:38:49,925
Sir, I have a meeting at the office.

552
00:38:51,165 --> 00:38:52,725
I'll drive you then.

553
00:38:52,805 --> 00:38:53,845
Let's go.

554
00:38:55,085 --> 00:38:55,925
Here.

555
00:38:56,805 --> 00:38:58,445
-Linlin, I'll come with you.
-No.

556
00:38:59,005 --> 00:39:00,485
Linlin is a dangerous driver.

557
00:39:01,085 --> 00:39:04,005
Mr. Wen, could you go
to the meeting later?

558
00:39:04,085 --> 00:39:05,645
Of course. Please.

559
00:39:06,045 --> 00:39:07,285
Let's go.

560
00:39:07,885 --> 00:39:09,325
Get in the car.

561
00:39:09,725 --> 00:39:11,565
Be a good girl. Come on.

562
00:39:35,765 --> 00:39:36,605
Drive faster.

563
00:39:38,485 --> 00:39:39,965
It's safer if I go slow.

564
00:39:40,045 --> 00:39:43,005
Look how slow you're going. Step on it.

565
00:39:48,365 --> 00:39:50,645
Look. People are waving hello to us.

566
00:39:51,165 --> 00:39:53,485
You can say hi to them, too.

567
00:39:53,845 --> 00:39:55,845
They're running faster than this car.
Speed up.

568
00:39:55,925 --> 00:39:56,925
Step on it!

569
00:39:57,005 --> 00:39:59,205
I am stepping on it. Calm down.

570
00:40:01,565 --> 00:40:03,925
Even the bike is going faster.
Can't you...

571
00:40:05,725 --> 00:40:07,565
Why is he honking at me?

572
00:40:07,645 --> 00:40:09,045
You're blocking the way.

573
00:40:09,445 --> 00:40:10,525
Can you drive faster?

574
00:40:10,605 --> 00:40:12,925
Will you step on the gas?

575
00:40:13,005 --> 00:40:14,445
I'm stepping on it already.

576
00:40:14,525 --> 00:40:16,205
When did you get your driver's license?

577
00:40:17,485 --> 00:40:18,645
Six months ago.

578
00:40:19,645 --> 00:40:20,925
Have you driven a car since?

579
00:40:21,765 --> 00:40:23,045
It's my first time today.

580
00:40:23,125 --> 00:40:25,445
-Look behind us--
-Don't look behind. Look ahead!

581
00:40:26,005 --> 00:40:27,885
Don't be nervous. I can do this.

582
00:40:28,245 --> 00:40:30,285
Stop talking to me.
Shut up and drive carefully.

583
00:40:30,365 --> 00:40:31,405
Drive faster.

584
00:40:33,205 --> 00:40:35,965
-Step on the gas. You're going so slow.
-I'm stepping on it already.

585
00:40:36,045 --> 00:40:37,805
When will we ever get home?

586
00:40:37,885 --> 00:40:39,685
-Let me drive. I'll drive.
-No.

587
00:40:39,765 --> 00:40:40,965
-Step on the gas.
-I am.

588
00:40:41,045 --> 00:40:42,405
-Step on it!
-I am stepping on it!

589
00:40:42,485 --> 00:40:43,445
You drive so slow.

590
00:40:51,165 --> 00:40:54,325
Yizhou.
Why did it take you guys two hours?

591
00:40:55,205 --> 00:40:56,805
With her driving,

592
00:40:56,885 --> 00:40:58,525
it's a miracle they even got here.

593
00:40:58,885 --> 00:41:01,085
Don't you know you have asthma?
Don't touch Pidan.

594
00:41:01,445 --> 00:41:02,925
Don't blame me if you have an attack.

595
00:41:03,005 --> 00:41:05,685
Pidan? That's a good name for him.

596
00:41:06,245 --> 00:41:08,725
He looks just like you.

597
00:41:10,965 --> 00:41:12,085
Where is this dog from?

598
00:41:15,685 --> 00:41:17,285
You gave him to me.

599
00:41:18,005 --> 00:41:19,645
You're saying I gave you a dog?

600
00:41:25,085 --> 00:41:26,405
No way, Linlin.

601
00:41:27,085 --> 00:41:29,605
Yizhou hates animals.

602
00:41:30,125 --> 00:41:32,445
Why would I lie about this?

603
00:41:33,365 --> 00:41:35,205
-Ask Wen Li.
-I will.

604
00:41:35,485 --> 00:41:37,965
After that, I want you to get rid of it.

605
00:41:38,925 --> 00:41:40,165
Get rid of it?

606
00:41:40,245 --> 00:41:41,885
You said we could keep him.

607
00:41:41,965 --> 00:41:45,085
I'm correcting my previous mistake, OK?

608
00:41:48,805 --> 00:41:50,645
It's just a dog.

609
00:41:51,085 --> 00:41:52,605
It's no big deal.

610
00:41:52,685 --> 00:41:54,365
-I'll keep it.
-No need.

611
00:41:55,045 --> 00:41:56,845
Pidan is my dog. You can't send him away.

612
00:41:56,925 --> 00:41:58,005
This is my house.

613
00:41:58,085 --> 00:41:59,445
If you don't do it, I'll do it.

614
00:41:59,685 --> 00:42:01,325
Then you can get rid of me, too.

615
00:42:01,405 --> 00:42:04,045
If you keep up this attitude,
I wouldn't mind doing that.

616
00:42:04,125 --> 00:42:05,085
Say that again.

617
00:42:05,365 --> 00:42:06,845
I think you heard me.

618
00:42:07,365 --> 00:42:08,205
Stop!

619
00:42:08,765 --> 00:42:09,845
We have to talk.

620
00:42:25,685 --> 00:42:26,525
Mr. Ling.

621
00:42:26,725 --> 00:42:28,845
Should we take down
all the photos of this incident?

622
00:42:29,245 --> 00:42:30,085
This incident?

623
00:42:31,765 --> 00:42:33,165
There was another one before?

624
00:42:33,805 --> 00:42:34,925
She creates so much gossip?

625
00:42:36,045 --> 00:42:37,125
It's not all gossip.

626
00:42:44,005 --> 00:42:45,645
I had someone take these photos?

627
00:42:45,725 --> 00:42:48,765
Yes. You loved your wife dearly
before you lost your memory.

628
00:44:23,925 --> 00:44:25,805
Subtitle translation by Christina Liu

629
00:44:26,405 --> 00:44:28,245
You mean I posted this on Weibo?

630
00:44:29,045 --> 00:44:31,285
Your wife manages your Weibo account.

631
00:44:33,285 --> 00:44:34,765
You've upset Ling.

632
00:44:35,405 --> 00:44:37,365
That makes regaining his affection

633
00:44:37,445 --> 00:44:39,845
pretty much impossible.

634
00:44:40,885 --> 00:44:41,925
What are you doing?

635
00:44:42,805 --> 00:44:44,765
I don't want to waste time on this.

636
00:44:45,445 --> 00:44:47,365
If you want to know my size,
go ask Wen Li.

637
00:44:51,125 --> 00:44:53,525
The way to a man's heart
is through his stomach.
