1
00:00:12,885 --> 00:00:14,205
Why are you here?

2
00:00:14,285 --> 00:00:16,565
Is this how you treat your guests?

3
00:00:16,965 --> 00:00:17,805
Nan?

4
00:00:18,125 --> 00:00:19,285
Long time no see...

5
00:00:22,165 --> 00:00:23,045
Mom.

6
00:00:26,405 --> 00:00:30,205
<i>"Ling Yizhou of Lingshi Group indifferent</i>
<i>towards his biological mother..."</i>

7
00:00:30,965 --> 00:00:32,445
Sir, I've investigated

8
00:00:32,525 --> 00:00:35,045
the source of the news article,
but the contributor was anonymous.

9
00:00:36,125 --> 00:00:37,885
I think you should go to the hospital.

10
00:00:38,325 --> 00:00:40,925
You might... be pregnant.

11
00:00:42,445 --> 00:00:46,205
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

12
00:02:13,085 --> 00:02:15,525
EPISODE 17

13
00:02:37,645 --> 00:02:38,925
Her phone and wallet are gone.

14
00:02:39,765 --> 00:02:43,205
Mr. Wang, we found her car,
but she's not here.

15
00:02:44,125 --> 00:02:44,965
Got it.

16
00:02:46,685 --> 00:02:49,805
Mr. Ling, Mr. Wang told us not
to touch anything. He's on his way here.

17
00:02:50,525 --> 00:02:51,405
-Pop the hood.
-OK.

18
00:03:03,045 --> 00:03:04,045
The coolant tank is empty.

19
00:03:04,445 --> 00:03:06,245
Could it be that the engine overheated,

20
00:03:06,325 --> 00:03:07,685
so Mrs. Ling had to pull over?

21
00:03:08,725 --> 00:03:10,525
But Mrs. Ling's car gets
regular maintenance.

22
00:03:11,005 --> 00:03:12,125
How could this happen?

23
00:03:15,165 --> 00:03:17,245
Someone must have tampered with it.

24
00:03:26,525 --> 00:03:27,565
You?

25
00:03:30,685 --> 00:03:31,885
Have some food.

26
00:03:40,805 --> 00:03:41,845
It's safe. Don't worry.

27
00:03:44,125 --> 00:03:44,965
Where am I?

28
00:03:46,845 --> 00:03:49,045
If you don't eat it, I'll take it away.

29
00:03:53,325 --> 00:03:54,365
Who are you working for?

30
00:03:55,565 --> 00:03:56,765
I'm here already.

31
00:03:56,845 --> 00:03:58,485
Can't I meet the mastermind behind this?

32
00:03:59,485 --> 00:04:02,005
He'll show up when the time is right.

33
00:04:03,125 --> 00:04:05,805
He can't show his face?
Or does he not have any guts?

34
00:04:09,605 --> 00:04:10,565
Where's my stuff?

35
00:04:11,165 --> 00:04:12,245
I'll keep it safe.

36
00:04:13,925 --> 00:04:15,565
These aren't ordinary earrings.

37
00:04:16,005 --> 00:04:19,805
They have GPS microchips inside
so I can locate you.

38
00:04:22,125 --> 00:04:23,725
Can you at least give me my watch?

39
00:04:24,485 --> 00:04:28,405
-I'll feel better knowing what time it is.
-No.

40
00:04:29,885 --> 00:04:31,165
How about my earrings?

41
00:04:32,005 --> 00:04:33,325
Ling Yizhou gave them to me.

42
00:04:33,725 --> 00:04:35,045
They can keep me company.

43
00:04:39,045 --> 00:04:41,725
I can't use them to commit suicide
or hurt other people.

44
00:04:44,965 --> 00:04:45,805
Yang Tong.

45
00:04:46,605 --> 00:04:50,445
Can you think about how nicely
I treated you before?

46
00:04:56,965 --> 00:04:57,845
I'll go get them.

47
00:05:26,525 --> 00:05:28,805
So? What have we found out so far?

48
00:05:31,565 --> 00:05:34,645
If I'd known that she was driving alone,
I'd have gone with her.

49
00:05:35,885 --> 00:05:37,245
What did you tell everyone?

50
00:05:37,565 --> 00:05:39,725
I told Mrs. Ling
that you found Xia Lin already,

51
00:05:40,205 --> 00:05:42,085
and that you wanted to celebrate alone.

52
00:05:42,765 --> 00:05:45,525
As for Ms. Huang,
I told her you needed some couple time

53
00:05:45,605 --> 00:05:47,125
and sent her to keep Grandma company.

54
00:05:49,245 --> 00:05:50,525
Keep an eye on the media.

55
00:05:51,165 --> 00:05:53,325
We can't let anyone find out
about Mumu's disappearance.

56
00:05:53,405 --> 00:05:54,365
Yes, sir.

57
00:05:58,325 --> 00:05:59,245
Mr. Ling.

58
00:05:59,805 --> 00:06:02,085
Mr. Wang, thank you for coming.

59
00:06:04,165 --> 00:06:05,565
That area is a security blind spot.

60
00:06:05,645 --> 00:06:07,325
A few robberies
have happened there before.

61
00:06:07,805 --> 00:06:10,685
It's possible that it was
a robbery gone awry.

62
00:06:11,005 --> 00:06:13,885
We can't treat it as planned kidnapping
just because of the coolant tank.

63
00:06:15,525 --> 00:06:18,525
Before Mrs. Ling drives the car,
security always checks it for problems.

64
00:06:19,765 --> 00:06:22,445
The only possibility is that
someone tampered with the car.

65
00:06:22,725 --> 00:06:23,685
What did the driver say?

66
00:06:23,765 --> 00:06:25,725
Mr. Liu knew
that Mrs. Ling would use the car.

67
00:06:25,805 --> 00:06:27,685
He made sure everything was alright.

68
00:06:28,405 --> 00:06:31,525
Before he headed out, he got
a stomachache and went to the hospital.

69
00:06:32,165 --> 00:06:33,605
That's why he didn't pick her up.

70
00:06:33,685 --> 00:06:36,165
I suspect that someone poisoned him.

71
00:06:38,845 --> 00:06:41,405
Mr. Liu has worked for the Lings
for two decades. He's trustworthy.

72
00:06:42,805 --> 00:06:45,725
Mr. Wang, An Ran told me that

73
00:06:46,045 --> 00:06:48,285
she didn't arrange
the car accident I was in.

74
00:06:49,245 --> 00:06:52,325
Could it be someone else behind her
who's trying to harm me?

75
00:06:52,645 --> 00:06:54,965
You think this incident was arranged
by the same person?

76
00:06:56,525 --> 00:06:57,365
I do.

77
00:07:02,965 --> 00:07:04,285
Sir, Mrs. Ling's location signal.

78
00:07:07,645 --> 00:07:08,525
This location...

79
00:07:09,125 --> 00:07:10,125
It's nearby.

80
00:07:33,365 --> 00:07:35,765
Yang Tong, thank you for helping me.

81
00:07:37,125 --> 00:07:38,965
You'd better not get your hopes up
too soon.

82
00:07:41,645 --> 00:07:42,685
Nan?

83
00:07:42,925 --> 00:07:44,245
We meet again.

84
00:07:44,845 --> 00:07:46,045
Why are you...

85
00:07:46,845 --> 00:07:47,965
You kidnapped me?

86
00:07:48,845 --> 00:07:50,005
Sir, I...

87
00:07:53,285 --> 00:07:54,485
Where's her other stuff?

88
00:07:55,045 --> 00:07:56,525
In a signal-blocked room.

89
00:07:57,365 --> 00:07:59,485
I'm sorry. I won't do it again.

90
00:08:19,525 --> 00:08:20,365
Give them to me.

91
00:08:20,805 --> 00:08:21,645
I won't.

92
00:08:23,805 --> 00:08:25,605
I really don't want to hurt you.

93
00:08:31,845 --> 00:08:34,565
Get rid of them. Don't let me down again.

94
00:08:36,125 --> 00:08:37,005
Yes, sir.

95
00:08:42,725 --> 00:08:44,445
You locked me in your house?

96
00:08:44,525 --> 00:08:45,405
Surprised?

97
00:08:46,044 --> 00:08:49,125
Right now, Ling Yizhou is still looking
for you with the police.

98
00:08:49,845 --> 00:08:51,445
If he knew that you were this close,

99
00:08:51,925 --> 00:08:53,765
he'd be so baffled.

100
00:08:54,645 --> 00:08:56,245
That really excites me.

101
00:08:57,365 --> 00:08:59,565
So you're the one who helped An Ran?

102
00:09:00,685 --> 00:09:02,605
Your target has always been Ling Yizhou.

103
00:09:03,765 --> 00:09:05,285
I thought you knew.

104
00:09:05,845 --> 00:09:07,445
We have history.

105
00:09:07,925 --> 00:09:11,765
I felt guilty for misunderstanding you.
I treated you like a friend.

106
00:09:12,405 --> 00:09:14,845
Why would you do something like this?
You're a horrible person.

107
00:09:14,925 --> 00:09:16,605
Shut your mouth! I'm telling you...

108
00:09:17,765 --> 00:09:19,685
you haven't been through
what I've been through.

109
00:09:20,125 --> 00:09:22,085
So you don't get to judge me.

110
00:09:29,765 --> 00:09:30,645
Get in here.

111
00:09:31,965 --> 00:09:32,885
Take Eleven away.

112
00:09:34,125 --> 00:09:36,085
-What are you doing?
-He doesn't need your concern.

113
00:09:36,165 --> 00:09:38,085
What do you think I'd do
to my own family member?

114
00:09:38,605 --> 00:09:40,565
We're going on a difficult trip.

115
00:09:41,085 --> 00:09:42,725
I don't want the dog to suffer with me.

116
00:09:43,005 --> 00:09:46,285
Family member?
If you can treat an animal kindly,

117
00:09:46,645 --> 00:09:48,245
why can't you treat people kindly?

118
00:09:48,325 --> 00:09:49,485
Because they're not worth it!

119
00:09:49,845 --> 00:09:51,525
Eleven is much more loyal.

120
00:09:51,605 --> 00:09:52,925
He's my best friend.

121
00:09:53,165 --> 00:09:54,565
Do you know why he's called Eleven?

122
00:09:54,645 --> 00:09:56,685
My mother passed away on that day.

123
00:09:57,245 --> 00:09:59,645
It's about time.
This is the last time you visit my house.

124
00:10:00,285 --> 00:10:01,125
Let go!

125
00:10:04,765 --> 00:10:06,365
Wait. Wen Li.

126
00:10:06,965 --> 00:10:09,285
Did you find out Nan Jintian's address?

127
00:10:09,365 --> 00:10:11,725
Not yet. He probably used another name.

128
00:10:13,885 --> 00:10:15,005
Let's go to that location.

129
00:10:15,445 --> 00:10:17,085
We'll spilt up and surround the place.

130
00:10:17,405 --> 00:10:18,245
Let's go.

131
00:10:43,285 --> 00:10:45,605
<i>You search the east side.</i>
<i>We'll block the west exit.</i>

132
00:10:45,685 --> 00:10:46,525
Got it.

133
00:10:47,325 --> 00:10:48,165
No problem.

134
00:10:50,285 --> 00:10:52,045
Mr. Ling, the signal is nearby.

135
00:11:09,525 --> 00:11:10,365
Mr. Ling.

136
00:11:11,885 --> 00:11:12,965
It's right here.

137
00:11:27,165 --> 00:11:28,205
It was a distraction.

138
00:11:29,045 --> 00:11:31,325
Before this, the signal was coming
from our neighborhood.

139
00:11:36,125 --> 00:11:39,325
I'll have someone track every vehicle
that left the area around that time.

140
00:11:40,125 --> 00:11:43,365
Mr. Wang, I want to go see someone first.

141
00:12:04,365 --> 00:12:05,885
You came earlier than I thought.

142
00:12:07,325 --> 00:12:09,205
I guess things aren't going well for you.

143
00:12:10,845 --> 00:12:12,085
An Ran.

144
00:12:13,605 --> 00:12:15,005
I want you to tell me...

145
00:12:16,245 --> 00:12:18,485
Are you a part of this?

146
00:12:19,645 --> 00:12:21,205
I don't know what you're talking about.

147
00:12:22,245 --> 00:12:23,525
Xia Lin has been kidnapped.

148
00:12:28,685 --> 00:12:32,285
If she wasn't kidnapped,
would you come see me?

149
00:12:35,045 --> 00:12:35,965
No.

150
00:12:38,805 --> 00:12:40,765
You won't even lie to me out of mercy.

151
00:12:44,165 --> 00:12:45,205
Then why are you here?

152
00:12:46,205 --> 00:12:49,045
I've never lied to you, ever.

153
00:12:49,325 --> 00:12:52,005
I never have, and I never will.

154
00:12:53,765 --> 00:12:54,645
I know.

155
00:12:56,325 --> 00:12:59,245
You're mad that I lied to you
and tricked you.

156
00:13:01,485 --> 00:13:02,805
But I don't regret it.

157
00:13:05,805 --> 00:13:06,645
Was it worth it?

158
00:13:08,805 --> 00:13:10,765
If you tell me who's behind all this...

159
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:13,845
I can try to have them
reduce your sentence.

160
00:13:15,885 --> 00:13:16,765
Reduce my sentence?

161
00:13:21,445 --> 00:13:22,965
I have no pride anymore.

162
00:13:24,645 --> 00:13:26,485
Do you think I still long for freedom?

163
00:13:28,525 --> 00:13:29,845
What I want right now...

164
00:13:30,845 --> 00:13:33,085
is for Xia Lin to go away forever.

165
00:13:34,725 --> 00:13:38,685
So that you can feel what it's like
to not get what you want.

166
00:13:47,365 --> 00:13:51,365
If anything happens to her,
Xing An will be the first to go down.

167
00:13:53,605 --> 00:13:56,765
Even if I tell you now,
it's already too late.

168
00:13:58,045 --> 00:13:59,005
What do you mean?

169
00:14:20,485 --> 00:14:21,325
Think about it.

170
00:14:22,805 --> 00:14:25,805
A beautiful young woman goes missing.

171
00:14:26,245 --> 00:14:27,365
Even if she comes back...

172
00:14:29,485 --> 00:14:31,125
what would people say about her?

173
00:14:33,045 --> 00:14:35,205
Could you live the same normal life
you had before?

174
00:14:42,765 --> 00:14:44,285
Whether she comes back or not...

175
00:14:46,285 --> 00:14:50,965
her reputation and life
have already been ruined.

176
00:15:03,885 --> 00:15:04,725
Manager...

177
00:15:06,045 --> 00:15:08,125
if I'm not mistaken,
that's Ling Yizhou, right?

178
00:15:09,125 --> 00:15:11,045
He's been drinking since he got here.

179
00:15:14,765 --> 00:15:16,365
-Go do your job.
-Yes, ma'am.

180
00:16:25,085 --> 00:16:26,405
Why are you here so early?

181
00:16:31,125 --> 00:16:32,165
What was that for, Chu Yan?

182
00:16:32,245 --> 00:16:34,085
I'm the one that should be asking you.

183
00:16:35,005 --> 00:16:36,165
What's this about?

184
00:16:39,365 --> 00:16:40,965
It's exactly what you see.

185
00:16:41,285 --> 00:16:42,685
Ling Yizhou, what's wrong with you?

186
00:16:43,245 --> 00:16:45,205
Your precious wife has disappeared

187
00:16:45,285 --> 00:16:46,805
and you're out with another woman?

188
00:16:47,925 --> 00:16:49,205
Let's talk in my office.

189
00:16:52,085 --> 00:16:54,365
Why? I don't care about my public image.

190
00:16:54,445 --> 00:16:56,125
Now you're worried about your reputation?

191
00:16:57,125 --> 00:16:58,125
I'm a human being.

192
00:17:00,165 --> 00:17:01,125
I get tired sometimes.

193
00:17:02,165 --> 00:17:04,925
Can't you give me some time and space

194
00:17:05,005 --> 00:17:06,845
so that I can breathe? Just let me be me.

195
00:17:08,725 --> 00:17:11,124
Have you thought about
what it's like for Xia Lin right now?

196
00:17:11,205 --> 00:17:13,925
-What if she's in danger?
-What kind of danger? Tell me.

197
00:17:18,685 --> 00:17:20,165
What if she gets assaulted?

198
00:17:20,844 --> 00:17:21,765
That's right.

199
00:17:23,324 --> 00:17:25,645
So even if she comes back,
we can't go back to what we were.

200
00:17:31,084 --> 00:17:31,925
Ling Yizhou.

201
00:17:33,124 --> 00:17:35,165
Who are you interrogating me as?

202
00:17:37,005 --> 00:17:40,085
My friend?
Or Xia Lin's backup love interest?

203
00:17:41,325 --> 00:17:44,245
Ling Yizhou, you're too big a loser
to be my friend.

204
00:17:45,365 --> 00:17:46,605
I'm telling you,

205
00:17:46,965 --> 00:17:48,445
if you don't take care of Xia Lin,

206
00:17:49,085 --> 00:17:51,005
I, Chu Yan, will still protect her.

207
00:18:22,565 --> 00:18:24,365
-You're finally home.
-Why are you here?

208
00:18:26,005 --> 00:18:27,485
Some things have to be said in person.

209
00:18:29,885 --> 00:18:30,845
Have you eaten yet?

210
00:18:31,525 --> 00:18:32,445
No.

211
00:18:32,525 --> 00:18:34,925
I'm too worried to eat.

212
00:18:35,845 --> 00:18:38,085
Go relax for a bit. I'll make some food.

213
00:18:42,765 --> 00:18:44,885
-Anything about Linlin?
-Not yet.

214
00:18:45,765 --> 00:18:47,765
Didn't they have a lead yesterday?

215
00:18:48,045 --> 00:18:51,085
The police are tracking the vehicles
that left the area around the same time.

216
00:18:51,165 --> 00:18:53,245
They found a black car
with a fake license plate.

217
00:18:54,005 --> 00:18:55,645
But it was abandoned in a rural area.

218
00:18:56,205 --> 00:18:58,565
So? They're not going
to keep investigating?

219
00:18:59,205 --> 00:19:01,725
The police are carrying out
a blanket search.

220
00:19:01,965 --> 00:19:03,485
I'm sure we'll hear something soon.

221
00:19:05,125 --> 00:19:07,005
No. That's too passive.

222
00:19:07,485 --> 00:19:09,685
Can't Ling Yizhou do something about it?

223
00:19:11,125 --> 00:19:12,885
I'm sure he's doing whatever he can.

224
00:19:13,165 --> 00:19:15,645
Stop covering up for him. I saw the news.

225
00:19:16,125 --> 00:19:17,845
I can understand drinking
your sorrows away,

226
00:19:17,925 --> 00:19:19,245
but who the hell was that woman?

227
00:19:19,885 --> 00:19:21,125
Mr. Ling owns the bar.

228
00:19:21,325 --> 00:19:22,685
That woman is the bar's manager.

229
00:19:23,125 --> 00:19:25,805
Why did the manager
have to go to a hotel room with her boss?

230
00:19:25,885 --> 00:19:29,565
I'm sure Mr. Ling would never do
anything that would hurt Mrs. Ling.

231
00:19:30,645 --> 00:19:33,165
He'd better not.
Or it won't just be betraying Linlin,

232
00:19:33,245 --> 00:19:34,925
-it will also be...
-Be what?

233
00:19:39,965 --> 00:19:42,605
Before we find Linlin,
keep an eye on him for me.

234
00:20:03,445 --> 00:20:07,165
<i>The number you dialed is unavailable.</i>

235
00:20:07,245 --> 00:20:08,325
<i>Please try again--</i>

236
00:20:13,605 --> 00:20:14,445
<i>Hello?</i>

237
00:20:15,605 --> 00:20:18,605
Hello, Mr. Wen.
I saw the news about Yizhou.

238
00:20:19,165 --> 00:20:21,365
Are things between him and Linlin alright?

239
00:20:21,565 --> 00:20:22,925
<i>They are doing fine.</i>

240
00:20:23,005 --> 00:20:24,885
You can't trust the news these days.

241
00:20:24,965 --> 00:20:26,525
We're doing everything we can.

242
00:20:27,445 --> 00:20:28,285
OK.

243
00:20:28,365 --> 00:20:31,565
Glad to hear that.
Linlin hasn't been picking up her phone.

244
00:20:31,645 --> 00:20:32,565
I'm worried about her.

245
00:20:32,925 --> 00:20:34,205
Mrs. Ling is doing fine.

246
00:20:34,765 --> 00:20:36,045
Is that all you wanted to know?

247
00:20:37,085 --> 00:20:38,125
Yes. That's all.

248
00:20:38,485 --> 00:20:40,405
I'll hang up now. Goodbye.

249
00:20:40,485 --> 00:20:41,325
<i>Goodbye.</i>

250
00:21:00,765 --> 00:21:01,725
Can I help you?

251
00:21:02,685 --> 00:21:03,765
Do I know you?

252
00:21:03,965 --> 00:21:05,885
It's fine. All that matters is I know you.

253
00:21:06,245 --> 00:21:07,085
Let go of him.

254
00:21:08,205 --> 00:21:10,205
Not any random woman can touch him.

255
00:21:10,605 --> 00:21:13,205
You're Yin Shuangshuang?

256
00:21:13,845 --> 00:21:16,325
If you know that,
why are you still standing here?

257
00:21:17,005 --> 00:21:20,365
Even if you want a bite of him,
I still came first.

258
00:21:24,565 --> 00:21:25,845
Aren't you my spokesperson?

259
00:21:26,045 --> 00:21:29,525
Director Ling, what a coincidence.
I'll get you a drink.

260
00:21:30,405 --> 00:21:31,245
Sure.

261
00:21:31,525 --> 00:21:32,605
Where should we drink?

262
00:21:35,485 --> 00:21:36,485
Your house.

263
00:21:44,365 --> 00:21:47,205
There's news about you staying at
Ms. Yin's house. Should we take it down?

264
00:21:47,285 --> 00:21:48,605
No. We'll see what happens.

265
00:21:48,805 --> 00:21:50,685
Your mother can't get in touch
with Mrs. Ling.

266
00:21:50,765 --> 00:21:52,445
She called me to ask about her.

267
00:21:53,045 --> 00:21:54,125
You know what to say.

268
00:21:54,445 --> 00:21:55,285
Yes, sir.

269
00:22:03,085 --> 00:22:04,165
You're awake?

270
00:22:04,725 --> 00:22:05,605
What are you doing?

271
00:22:07,405 --> 00:22:09,205
This isn't my bed. I couldn't fall asleep.

272
00:22:09,845 --> 00:22:11,485
But you didn't have a problem with it.

273
00:22:13,005 --> 00:22:15,605
If you miss your bed,
you should take me home.

274
00:22:16,205 --> 00:22:18,085
Why do you want to leave?

275
00:22:18,485 --> 00:22:20,165
Aren't we getting along quite well?

276
00:22:21,245 --> 00:22:22,605
I wasn't careful enough before.

277
00:22:23,045 --> 00:22:24,725
That's why this is happening to me now.

278
00:22:25,285 --> 00:22:28,365
Trust me. This is just the beginning.

279
00:22:28,805 --> 00:22:30,805
What are you going to threaten him with?

280
00:22:31,525 --> 00:22:32,925
He doesn't have to do anything.

281
00:22:34,085 --> 00:22:36,405
I just want to see him lose
the woman he loves

282
00:22:36,845 --> 00:22:38,925
and never be happy.

283
00:22:40,845 --> 00:22:44,005
You'll never succeed. He'll find me.

284
00:22:48,965 --> 00:22:49,805
Well...

285
00:22:51,045 --> 00:22:52,365
before he finds you...

286
00:22:53,565 --> 00:22:56,725
there'll probably be a new Mrs. Ling.

287
00:22:57,885 --> 00:22:59,645
I thought he'd last longer than this.

288
00:23:00,325 --> 00:23:03,405
But he moved on pretty fast.

289
00:23:03,925 --> 00:23:07,045
Maybe I overestimated
how much he cares about you.

290
00:23:08,085 --> 00:23:08,925
Nan Jintian.

291
00:23:09,645 --> 00:23:11,805
I know what kind of person Ling Yizhou is.

292
00:23:11,885 --> 00:23:13,725
Don't waste your time
trying to drive us apart.

293
00:23:14,925 --> 00:23:17,165
I'm just showing you the real him.

294
00:23:17,605 --> 00:23:20,085
You just want me to doubt him
and lose trust in him.

295
00:23:20,605 --> 00:23:23,605
That way, even if he finds me,
we won't be the same anymore.

296
00:23:26,285 --> 00:23:27,845
He stayed at Yin Shuangshuang's house.

297
00:23:28,205 --> 00:23:29,605
What did they do there?

298
00:23:29,885 --> 00:23:31,325
Should I explain it to you?

299
00:23:32,005 --> 00:23:33,205
I trust him.

300
00:23:34,245 --> 00:23:35,925
I've always hated people...

301
00:23:37,125 --> 00:23:39,165
who lose their rationality over love.

302
00:24:01,925 --> 00:24:04,765
It's time to send him a present.

303
00:24:36,765 --> 00:24:40,205
Sir, someone sent this to the front desk
and said it was a gift for you.

304
00:24:43,485 --> 00:24:46,005
Ling Yizhou! I trusted you!

305
00:24:46,085 --> 00:24:47,685
Were you just pretending in front of us?

306
00:24:47,925 --> 00:24:50,765
Linlin just got kidnapped
and now you're out with other women?

307
00:24:51,245 --> 00:24:53,885
Miss Jia, I'm at work right now.
Please leave.

308
00:24:54,525 --> 00:24:56,245
-Feifei, come with me.
-Let go!

309
00:24:57,005 --> 00:24:58,325
You're at work?

310
00:24:58,405 --> 00:25:00,005
What a great excuse.

311
00:25:00,245 --> 00:25:02,405
I want to talk about Linlin right now.
Can you do that?

312
00:25:02,925 --> 00:25:03,765
Miss Jia,

313
00:25:04,565 --> 00:25:06,805
you're a friend of Linlin's.

314
00:25:07,565 --> 00:25:09,085
So I'm giving you another chance.

315
00:25:10,045 --> 00:25:12,885
Please leave this room immediately.

316
00:25:13,325 --> 00:25:14,245
Wow.

317
00:25:14,685 --> 00:25:16,925
You're such a hypocrite, Director Ling.

318
00:25:17,405 --> 00:25:20,245
Too bad we don't know
if Linlin will ever see this side of you.

319
00:25:21,805 --> 00:25:24,245
Oh, have you thought
about your unborn child?

320
00:25:28,205 --> 00:25:31,245
What child? What did you just say?

321
00:25:31,845 --> 00:25:34,485
Your wife, Xia Lin,
is four weeks pregnant.

322
00:25:35,165 --> 00:25:37,725
She was going to give you
a surprise on your birthday.

323
00:25:38,285 --> 00:25:41,525
But I guess you gave her
a terrible surprise first.

324

325
00:26:09,845 --> 00:26:10,685
Feifei.

326
00:26:11,725 --> 00:26:13,765
You're emotional right now.
Let me drive you home.

327
00:26:14,205 --> 00:26:16,685
Let go of me! Why should I trust you?

328
00:26:17,045 --> 00:26:19,245
Just a manager meeting her boss?

329
00:26:19,685 --> 00:26:21,205
He sent you to calm me down, didn't he?

330
00:26:21,285 --> 00:26:22,805
You're all the same.

331
00:26:22,885 --> 00:26:25,645
Feifei, I'm not going
to argue with you right now.

332
00:26:25,725 --> 00:26:26,885
Do you have the nerve to?

333
00:26:26,965 --> 00:26:28,565
I'm just telling the truth.

334
00:26:28,645 --> 00:26:30,805
Ling Yizhou has an affair
and you cover it up for him.

335
00:26:31,205 --> 00:26:32,845
Can you say you didn't know about it?

336
00:26:33,765 --> 00:26:36,205
Feifei, you can take your anger out on me,

337
00:26:36,525 --> 00:26:37,605
but stop all this nonsense.

338
00:26:37,685 --> 00:26:39,925
I'll be responsible for what I say.

339
00:26:40,005 --> 00:26:42,085
From now on, stay away from me.

340
00:26:42,165 --> 00:26:43,285
I'm done with you.

341
00:26:57,925 --> 00:26:59,205
Why did you kiss me?

342
00:26:59,645 --> 00:27:01,285
I didn't want to hear what you'd say next.

343
00:27:01,365 --> 00:27:04,725
So it was just to make me shut up?

344
00:27:05,125 --> 00:27:06,725
-You do this to other people, too?
-No.

345
00:27:06,805 --> 00:27:08,645
Only you.

346
00:27:09,565 --> 00:27:10,565
Feifei.

347
00:27:10,645 --> 00:27:12,365
I know it's bad timing,

348
00:27:12,685 --> 00:27:15,485
but if I don't say this now,
I worry I'll never get another chance.

349
00:27:16,445 --> 00:27:17,485
What is it?

350
00:27:19,165 --> 00:27:20,205
Feifei.

351
00:27:21,005 --> 00:27:23,765
In the past, I never knew
what it was like to like someone.

352
00:27:25,005 --> 00:27:26,245
But then I met you.

353
00:27:27,125 --> 00:27:29,445
It's like I can only see
your face in a crowd.

354
00:27:29,525 --> 00:27:31,165
When I don't see you, I miss you.

355
00:27:32,365 --> 00:27:33,525
I want to get closer to you.

356
00:27:35,765 --> 00:27:36,845
I want to take care of you.

357
00:27:37,165 --> 00:27:39,285
I want to see you happy, not sad.

358
00:27:40,565 --> 00:27:41,445
You dork.

359
00:27:42,245 --> 00:27:43,765
Why are you telling me this now?

360
00:27:45,325 --> 00:27:48,325
I guess the crisis stirred up
some emotions inside me.

361
00:27:49,085 --> 00:27:51,245
Feifei, I like you.

362
00:27:52,325 --> 00:27:53,765
Will you give me a chance?

363
00:27:55,325 --> 00:27:57,165
You'll have to find Linlin first.

364
00:27:57,965 --> 00:28:00,165
Don't worry. Mr. Ling has a plan.

365
00:28:01,005 --> 00:28:01,925
What do you mean?

366
00:28:05,165 --> 00:28:07,085
Ling, Xia Lin...

367
00:28:07,365 --> 00:28:08,725
Chu Yan, why are you here?

368
00:28:09,365 --> 00:28:12,005
I have to act in your play.
You even got Yin Shuangshuang to help.

369
00:28:12,365 --> 00:28:14,165
If I don't, how will you do it without me?

370
00:28:23,605 --> 00:28:24,445
Hey.

371
00:28:24,925 --> 00:28:27,085
You should know better.
How could you just disappear?

372
00:28:28,325 --> 00:28:30,485
Thank you. You may leave now.

373
00:28:39,005 --> 00:28:39,925
What's going on?

374
00:28:41,405 --> 00:28:44,405
I went to see An Ran.
She's still not talking.

375
00:28:45,205 --> 00:28:47,765
What about the men you sent? Nothing?

376
00:28:47,845 --> 00:28:48,885
Nothing.

377
00:28:51,805 --> 00:28:53,365
If they're not taking the initiative...

378
00:28:54,525 --> 00:28:56,365
we'll have to force them
to show their hand.

379
00:29:01,525 --> 00:29:03,205
But we've done a lot of acting.

380
00:29:03,845 --> 00:29:06,365
-Why haven't we heard anything yet?
-We have.

381
00:29:08,005 --> 00:29:11,325
I'm sure that Xia Lin
and the child are safe.

382
00:29:12,805 --> 00:29:14,725
Or else he wouldn't threaten me with this.

383
00:29:18,605 --> 00:29:20,045
You're in a good mood.

384
00:29:21,205 --> 00:29:22,045
I am.

385
00:29:24,525 --> 00:29:25,885
I have good news.

386
00:29:27,805 --> 00:29:28,925
I'm going to be a dad.

387
00:29:35,925 --> 00:29:37,325
Aren't you going to congratulate me?

388
00:29:39,085 --> 00:29:41,045
How far along is she?

389
00:29:42,085 --> 00:29:42,925
Four weeks.

390
00:29:44,525 --> 00:29:45,645
That's not very long.

391
00:29:48,405 --> 00:29:49,485
What if...

392
00:29:50,365 --> 00:29:51,485
I mean what if...

393
00:29:52,685 --> 00:29:54,725
What if she loses the child?

394
00:29:57,005 --> 00:29:58,805
I don't know what I'd do then.

395
00:30:00,845 --> 00:30:03,685
You know what kind of family I came from,
what my parents were like.

396
00:30:04,805 --> 00:30:08,725
People might think I was born
with a silver spoon in my mouth.

397
00:30:09,405 --> 00:30:10,885
That I always got what I wanted.

398
00:30:11,165 --> 00:30:14,245
But I know that all I want
is a happy family.

399
00:30:18,725 --> 00:30:19,885
What are you trying to say?

400
00:30:22,725 --> 00:30:23,645
I could have...

401
00:30:25,685 --> 00:30:28,085
got everything I wanted on my birthday.

402
00:30:30,005 --> 00:30:32,605
But now, my wife
and child have disappeared.

403
00:30:34,925 --> 00:30:35,765
An Ran.

404
00:30:37,085 --> 00:30:38,405
I'm begging you. Please help me.

405
00:30:39,245 --> 00:30:40,805
Let me have my chance to be happy.

406
00:30:44,245 --> 00:30:45,325
Yizhou...

407
00:30:47,845 --> 00:30:51,085
But I'm not the person
who can make you happy.

408
00:31:04,085 --> 00:31:07,165
Do you know who sent me the photo?

409
00:31:07,245 --> 00:31:08,285
Who?

410
00:31:08,885 --> 00:31:09,845
Nan Jintian.

411
00:31:18,285 --> 00:31:21,005
You... You know everything?

412
00:31:25,365 --> 00:31:26,805
I was just guessing.

413
00:31:29,685 --> 00:31:31,045
Thanks for giving me the answer.

414
00:31:38,725 --> 00:31:40,525
Why do you have so many enemies?

415
00:31:41,245 --> 00:31:44,805
Competitors, acquired companies,
people I made bankrupt.

416
00:31:45,165 --> 00:31:46,485
And some personal feuds.

417
00:31:48,245 --> 00:31:50,765
You really dug up some dirt on them.

418
00:31:51,165 --> 00:31:53,685
These are just from the past few days.

419
00:31:55,165 --> 00:31:57,245
It's not enough, but it's a start.

420
00:32:00,445 --> 00:32:04,405
Sir, you had me investigate Nan Jintian.
I found something suspicious.

421
00:32:05,365 --> 00:32:06,485
Nan Jintian?

422
00:32:06,565 --> 00:32:08,765
Isn't he your mom's stepson?

423
00:32:09,365 --> 00:32:10,685
He's connected to Zhuoyuan Group?

424
00:32:10,765 --> 00:32:14,205
Yes. We've been discussing
cooperation with Zhuoyuan lately.

425
00:32:15,485 --> 00:32:18,605
So, he made sure you were busy with work

426
00:32:19,045 --> 00:32:21,085
and took the opportunity
to kidnap Xia Lin.

427
00:32:21,965 --> 00:32:23,205
That seems logical.

428
00:32:23,445 --> 00:32:26,205
But why would he want to do that to you?

429
00:32:26,485 --> 00:32:28,085
That's not the only suspicious thing.

430
00:32:28,605 --> 00:32:31,045
A lot of our employees were quitting
to work somewhere else.

431
00:32:31,125 --> 00:32:32,645
I looked into those small companies

432
00:32:32,965 --> 00:32:36,125
and found that all their representatives
used to work at Nan Jintian's company.

433
00:32:37,325 --> 00:32:40,685
But just from that, we still
can't be sure that he has Xia Lin.

434
00:32:44,325 --> 00:32:45,285
I know how to make sure.

435
00:32:51,645 --> 00:32:52,485
An Ran,

436
00:32:53,365 --> 00:32:56,685
I gave you a chance to come clean,
but you didn't take it.

437
00:33:03,125 --> 00:33:05,565
Whether I take it or not...

438
00:33:07,205 --> 00:33:08,645
it doesn't make any difference.

439
00:33:18,485 --> 00:33:19,925
You'll never see me again.

440
00:33:31,605 --> 00:33:34,165
She's missed you all these years.

441
00:33:35,565 --> 00:33:37,925
I often catch her looking at your photos.

442
00:33:38,885 --> 00:33:40,485
She treats me well,

443
00:33:41,045 --> 00:33:41,965
but I know that...

444
00:33:43,205 --> 00:33:44,925
she's just projecting her feelings on me.

445
00:33:45,525 --> 00:33:47,485
The person she misses is you.

446
00:33:49,005 --> 00:33:50,045
Long time no see.

447
00:33:57,245 --> 00:33:58,365
I'll help you.

448
00:34:04,365 --> 00:34:05,325
Help me with what?

449
00:34:06,605 --> 00:34:09,725
After all, we are brothers.

450
00:34:10,205 --> 00:34:11,285
Right, brother?

451
00:34:19,244 --> 00:34:20,285
Head to Lingyun Hotel.

452
00:34:20,925 --> 00:34:21,765
Yes, sir.

453
00:34:33,925 --> 00:34:34,765
Yizhou?

454
00:34:34,845 --> 00:34:36,125
I have to ask you something.

455
00:34:38,684 --> 00:34:39,525
Come in.

456
00:34:48,085 --> 00:34:49,805
How's your relationship with Nan Jintian?

457
00:34:50,244 --> 00:34:51,684
He's quite antisocial.

458
00:34:52,445 --> 00:34:54,845
We've never been close.

459
00:34:55,485 --> 00:34:56,605
If I remember correctly,

460
00:34:56,684 --> 00:34:59,405
you joined the Nan family right after
Nan Jintian's mother passed away.

461
00:35:01,125 --> 00:35:02,765
That was so long ago.

462
00:35:04,325 --> 00:35:05,445
Why did you bring that up?

463
00:35:05,765 --> 00:35:08,045
I want to know
why Nan Jintian kidnapped Mumu.

464
00:35:08,725 --> 00:35:09,565
He kidnapped her?

465
00:35:09,925 --> 00:35:11,805
He kidnapped Mumu on my birthday.

466
00:35:12,685 --> 00:35:13,805
How could this happen?

467
00:35:14,285 --> 00:35:15,525
I've never done anything to him.

468
00:35:16,045 --> 00:35:18,245
I couldn't figure out why he did this.

469
00:35:19,165 --> 00:35:22,445
The only possible reason
is because of you.

470
00:35:23,845 --> 00:35:24,685
Yizhou.

471
00:35:27,925 --> 00:35:28,805
I'm sorry.

472
00:35:31,165 --> 00:35:32,205
This is all my fault.

473
00:35:34,845 --> 00:35:35,685
Back then...

474
00:35:37,445 --> 00:35:39,685
Nan Jintian's mother's illness
took a turn for the worse...

475
00:35:41,805 --> 00:35:43,165
because...

476
00:35:47,365 --> 00:35:49,845
she saw me with his father.

477
00:35:55,525 --> 00:35:57,765
Your relationship hurt a lot of people.

478
00:35:58,765 --> 00:36:01,485
It ruined my life before,
and now it's doing it again.

479
00:36:02,245 --> 00:36:03,845
Just because you're my mother,

480
00:36:04,125 --> 00:36:07,085
that's why Nan Jintian
is taking all his anger out on me.

481
00:36:08,245 --> 00:36:09,325
Are you happy now?

482
00:36:10,205 --> 00:36:11,045
But...

483
00:36:12,685 --> 00:36:15,285
Sir, the police have found
Nan Jintian's location.

484
00:36:28,125 --> 00:36:31,045
Nan Jintian, did you do this?

485
00:36:32,565 --> 00:36:34,525
Did you kidnap Xia Lin?

486
00:36:34,805 --> 00:36:37,245
Mother, what are you talking about?

487
00:36:37,885 --> 00:36:39,405
I don't understand what you're saying.

488
00:36:40,525 --> 00:36:44,605
<i>Nan Jintian, it was all my fault.</i>

489
00:36:45,085 --> 00:36:47,165
You should take it out on me.

490
00:36:48,325 --> 00:36:49,925
Don't hurt innocent people.

491
00:36:50,445 --> 00:36:51,365
Innocent?

492
00:36:52,605 --> 00:36:54,445
She's your son's beloved wife.

493
00:36:55,245 --> 00:36:56,485
How could she be innocent?

494
00:36:58,765 --> 00:37:01,085
Is Ling Yizhou almost worried
to death right now?

495
00:37:01,765 --> 00:37:02,885
I'm sure he's very scared.

496
00:37:03,765 --> 00:37:06,965
Too bad I didn't get
to see his expression.

497
00:37:07,565 --> 00:37:10,125
<i>Nan Jintian, let Xia Lin go immediately.</i>

498
00:37:10,565 --> 00:37:12,285
Or else I'll tell your dad about this.

499
00:37:12,805 --> 00:37:13,805
<i>My dad?</i>

500
00:37:14,325 --> 00:37:16,125
He doesn't want me as his son.

501
00:37:16,925 --> 00:37:18,485
Why would he worry about what I do?

502
00:37:19,645 --> 00:37:21,885
<i>Have you forgotten</i>
<i>that you caused all this?</i>

503
00:37:22,845 --> 00:37:25,085
You went too far.

504
00:37:25,525 --> 00:37:27,205
You can't blame your father
for being cruel.

505
00:37:29,725 --> 00:37:31,325
Your father still cares about you.

506
00:37:33,685 --> 00:37:34,685
He cares about me?

507
00:37:36,445 --> 00:37:39,205
I just played a few pranks on you.

508
00:37:39,525 --> 00:37:40,925
<i>And he kicked me out.</i>

509
00:37:42,885 --> 00:37:45,525
The way he cares about me
seems quite strange.

510
00:37:49,485 --> 00:37:50,605
Sir, the police are here.

511
00:37:55,285 --> 00:37:56,285
Mother.

512
00:37:57,645 --> 00:38:00,685
You're trying so hard
to make your son forgive you.

513
00:38:01,525 --> 00:38:02,725
How considerate of you.

514
00:38:03,445 --> 00:38:05,685
You even called to stall me.

515
00:38:07,125 --> 00:38:10,045
It's not too late to stop, Nan Jintian.

516
00:38:10,125 --> 00:38:11,725
I'm afraid you'll be disappointed then.

517
00:38:12,725 --> 00:38:14,245
I'm going to give you a huge gift.

518
00:39:41,845 --> 00:39:43,085
They just left.

519
00:39:44,445 --> 00:39:46,525
Block the highways.
Don't let them leave the city.

520
00:39:53,045 --> 00:39:54,165
Got it.

521
00:39:59,445 --> 00:40:01,045
Keep an eye on them.

522
00:40:20,245 --> 00:40:21,405
Where are you taking me?

523
00:40:22,325 --> 00:40:25,045
I'm tired of that room.
We're staying somewhere else.

524
00:40:26,765 --> 00:40:29,285
Ling Yizhou found that place, didn't he?

525
00:40:30,325 --> 00:40:32,125
Or else you wouldn't be in such a rush.

526
00:40:40,125 --> 00:40:42,805
If you don't want to get hurt, stay still.

527
00:40:45,525 --> 00:40:46,685
I'll be quick.

528
00:41:00,645 --> 00:41:01,965
So what if he found it?

529
00:41:02,725 --> 00:41:03,885
I'm still one step ahead.

530
00:41:04,805 --> 00:41:05,645
What does that mean?

531
00:41:07,925 --> 00:41:09,485
It means that you're slipping up.

532
00:41:10,605 --> 00:41:11,845
He'll find me soon.

533
00:41:17,045 --> 00:41:17,965
You're wrong.

534
00:41:18,565 --> 00:41:19,765
It only means that...

535
00:41:22,685 --> 00:41:23,965
I'm smarter than him.

536
00:41:25,045 --> 00:41:26,645
I'll be the one who wins in the end.

537
00:41:29,085 --> 00:41:30,685
Don't look at me like that.

538
00:41:32,045 --> 00:41:32,885
It's no use.

539
00:41:45,125 --> 00:41:46,405
Let's make a deal.

540
00:41:47,685 --> 00:41:48,965
Couldn't hold it in anymore?

541
00:41:49,885 --> 00:41:51,205
That was faster than I expected.

542
00:41:52,405 --> 00:41:54,845
I know how much Director Ling can drink.

543
00:41:55,045 --> 00:41:57,765
You wouldn't be drunk
with just a few drinks.

544
00:41:58,525 --> 00:42:01,685
So, you wanted to be seen?

545
00:42:02,525 --> 00:42:04,445
If you knew, why did you play along?

546
00:42:05,045 --> 00:42:06,765
I know that Director Ling
is very generous.

547
00:42:09,445 --> 00:42:13,125
Aren't you worried they will shame you
for wrecking my marriage?

548
00:42:15,125 --> 00:42:17,405
Director Ling was being harassed
at the bar.

549
00:42:17,805 --> 00:42:21,125
As Mrs. Ling's
former colleague and friend,

550
00:42:21,565 --> 00:42:23,085
I couldn't let that happen.

551
00:42:23,525 --> 00:42:24,805
The woman at the bar

552
00:42:25,645 --> 00:42:27,605
was all the protection I needed.
Right, Mr. Ling?

553
00:42:32,125 --> 00:42:35,205
I'll send the contract for next year's
spokesperson to the agency.

554
00:44:10,925 --> 00:44:12,685
Subtitle translation by Sophie Chang

555
00:44:12,765 --> 00:44:14,805
Someone has been covering up
Nan Jintian's tracks.

556
00:44:15,085 --> 00:44:18,005
Could this slip-up be an intentional clue
they were leaving us?

557
00:44:18,205 --> 00:44:19,685
I have to thank you.

558
00:44:19,765 --> 00:44:21,325
You added a lot of dramatic effect

559
00:44:21,925 --> 00:44:23,525
to this play I'm directing right now.

560
00:44:24,365 --> 00:44:26,085
You let them find us on purpose.

561
00:44:28,845 --> 00:44:30,125
Why did you lock the door?

562
00:44:31,125 --> 00:44:32,045
Xia Lin?

563
00:44:32,565 --> 00:44:35,285
Why do you have the courage
to keep testing my limits?

564
00:44:35,645 --> 00:44:37,045
Because we're friends.

565
00:44:37,125 --> 00:44:38,565
From what I know,

566
00:44:39,005 --> 00:44:42,485
he's probably doing this
to avenge his biological mother.
