1
00:00:12,885 --> 00:00:14,045
Chu Yan is gone.

2
00:00:14,805 --> 00:00:15,845
It's true.

3
00:00:16,605 --> 00:00:18,165
The police are already investigating.

4
00:00:19,565 --> 00:00:20,965
The coroner's autopsy was released.

5
00:00:21,285 --> 00:00:23,285
Chu Yan was holding an earring
in his right hand.

6
00:00:24,565 --> 00:00:26,085
Your earring was in his hand.

7
00:00:27,045 --> 00:00:28,765
With no other evidence besides this...

8
00:00:29,685 --> 00:00:30,805
you're the primary suspect.

9
00:00:31,125 --> 00:00:32,045
What...

10
00:00:32,125 --> 00:00:33,645
Regarding Mr. Chu Yan's death,

11
00:00:33,725 --> 00:00:35,565
we'd like to ask
for Miss Xia's cooperation.

12
00:00:35,645 --> 00:00:37,245
You were away from the apartment

13
00:00:37,325 --> 00:00:39,965
at the exact same time
the fire started at the hospital.

14
00:00:41,325 --> 00:00:45,085
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

15
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:14,924
EPISODE 14

16
00:02:16,125 --> 00:02:19,885
You're the one who killed Chu Yan.

17
00:02:20,645 --> 00:02:22,125
Even when Ling Yizhou gets here,

18
00:02:22,645 --> 00:02:24,725
he won't be able to change that fact.

19
00:02:30,205 --> 00:02:32,285
-Why announce it now?
-A few words?

20
00:02:35,565 --> 00:02:36,685
What if I show up?

21
00:02:36,765 --> 00:02:38,245
Isn't that Chu Yan?

22
00:02:38,325 --> 00:02:39,445
Chu Yan?

23
00:02:39,525 --> 00:02:40,685
It's really him!

24
00:02:42,085 --> 00:02:43,565
-It is.
-How could it be?

25
00:02:43,645 --> 00:02:44,925
-He's not dead.
-It can't be him.

26
00:02:45,005 --> 00:02:45,965
He's alive.

27
00:02:46,445 --> 00:02:47,765
-What happened?
-What's going on?

28
00:02:48,045 --> 00:02:49,845
-Quick, film this.
-He's actually alive.

29
00:02:50,925 --> 00:02:53,325
This is huge news. Huge!

30
00:02:54,405 --> 00:02:56,285
-What a twist this is.
-I know.

31
00:03:01,645 --> 00:03:04,245
Little princess, we meet again.

32
00:03:05,005 --> 00:03:06,325
Chu Yan is here.

33
00:03:11,125 --> 00:03:12,085
Hello, everyone.

34
00:03:13,605 --> 00:03:15,525
We held this press conference today

35
00:03:15,605 --> 00:03:17,805
not just to announce
my marriage to Miss Xia,

36
00:03:17,885 --> 00:03:20,205
but also to clarify some false information

37
00:03:20,485 --> 00:03:23,885
about the relationship
between her and Mr. Chu.

38
00:03:26,965 --> 00:03:28,685
I imagine you're all quite curious.

39
00:03:29,165 --> 00:03:31,205
I clearly died
in the fire at the hospital.

40
00:03:31,605 --> 00:03:33,125
How could I show up here?

41
00:03:34,125 --> 00:03:36,245
Are you implying there's another killer?

42
00:03:36,485 --> 00:03:38,565
Is this some sort of act
by you and Miss Xia?

43
00:03:38,925 --> 00:03:41,605
You're right,
this is indeed a sort of act.

44
00:03:41,685 --> 00:03:42,885
An act?

45
00:03:42,965 --> 00:03:45,605
Unknowingly, in the case of Mrs. Ling,

46
00:03:45,925 --> 00:03:47,365
I became the lead male actor.

47
00:03:48,325 --> 00:03:49,325
The director of this act

48
00:03:49,885 --> 00:03:51,605
was someone who grew up with me

49
00:03:52,165 --> 00:03:54,045
and called me her brother for 22 years.

50
00:03:58,165 --> 00:04:00,005
Miss An Ran.

51
00:04:01,565 --> 00:04:03,405
Miss An, is this true?

52
00:04:03,845 --> 00:04:05,725
Did you start the fire at the hospital?

53
00:04:05,965 --> 00:04:08,165
No, this had nothing to do with me.

54
00:04:08,765 --> 00:04:11,325
I would never hurt you, Chu Yan.

55
00:04:12,165 --> 00:04:14,445
How could you not believe me?

56
00:04:14,845 --> 00:04:17,765
An Ran, if anyone else
told me about this...

57
00:04:18,765 --> 00:04:20,045
I'd never believe it.

58
00:04:21,084 --> 00:04:23,284
But I saw it with my own eyes.

59
00:04:44,725 --> 00:04:46,325
You're my new nurse?

60
00:04:46,885 --> 00:04:48,965
The head nurse took time off.
I'm covering for her.

61
00:05:32,485 --> 00:05:33,485
Chu Yan...

62
00:05:35,245 --> 00:05:36,365
Don't blame me for this.

63
00:05:41,325 --> 00:05:42,845
So no matter what you say,

64
00:05:43,245 --> 00:05:44,605
we'll never believe you.

65
00:05:45,925 --> 00:05:48,085
Miss An, why did you frame Miss Xia?

66
00:05:48,165 --> 00:05:50,165
Wait, whose corpse is in the morgue then?

67
00:05:50,445 --> 00:05:51,725
-Please tell us.
-How evil.

68
00:05:52,085 --> 00:05:53,765
-Please explain.
-Answer the question.

69
00:05:53,845 --> 00:05:55,245
-Please, miss.
-Is it true?

70
00:05:55,325 --> 00:05:56,445
Yes, please elaborate.

71
00:05:56,525 --> 00:05:57,845
Miss An, please say something.

72
00:05:57,925 --> 00:05:59,685
Why would you do something like that?

73
00:06:00,605 --> 00:06:02,085
She's so evil.

74
00:06:02,405 --> 00:06:05,005
-Why, Miss An?
-Can you explain?

75
00:06:05,085 --> 00:06:06,525
Did someone force you to do it?

76
00:06:08,005 --> 00:06:09,605
Please say something, Miss An.

77
00:06:09,685 --> 00:06:11,045
Miss An!

78
00:06:11,125 --> 00:06:12,125
-Don't go.
-Miss An!

79
00:06:13,685 --> 00:06:14,725
I don't know anything.

80
00:06:20,725 --> 00:06:22,005
Ling Yizhou...

81
00:06:23,565 --> 00:06:25,605
You won't be so lucky next time.

82
00:06:28,685 --> 00:06:30,965
Please explain, Miss An.

83
00:06:31,045 --> 00:06:32,685
Is that the truth, Miss An?

84
00:06:32,765 --> 00:06:35,125
It had nothing to do with me.
I didn't do it.

85
00:06:35,205 --> 00:06:36,285
It wasn't me.

86
00:06:36,365 --> 00:06:38,325
-Please answer us, Miss An.
-I don't know.

87
00:06:38,405 --> 00:06:39,405
I'll give you an answer.

88
00:06:42,165 --> 00:06:43,485
The body you saw at the hospital

89
00:06:43,565 --> 00:06:45,045
has been identified by the police

90
00:06:45,125 --> 00:06:47,205
as a corpse
that went missing at the morgue.

91
00:06:51,925 --> 00:06:54,885
Over the past few days,
I was locked in a warehouse.

92
00:07:19,085 --> 00:07:20,005
Did you kidnap me?

93
00:07:20,645 --> 00:07:21,845
Do you know who I am?

94
00:07:22,365 --> 00:07:24,445
People must be looking for me right now.

95
00:07:25,045 --> 00:07:27,565
If you let me go,
I won't hold it against you.

96
00:07:28,165 --> 00:07:29,445
Do you hear me?

97
00:07:30,245 --> 00:07:32,645
Don't waste your breath, Mr. Chu.

98
00:07:33,125 --> 00:07:35,645
Everyone thinks you're dead already.

99
00:07:36,085 --> 00:07:37,565
You shouldn't have said that.

100
00:07:37,765 --> 00:07:39,405
Dead? What do you mean?

101
00:07:40,605 --> 00:07:41,525
Hey!

102
00:07:49,165 --> 00:07:50,925
Fine. Listen up.

103
00:07:51,005 --> 00:07:52,845
I don't care how much
your boss is paying you,

104
00:07:52,925 --> 00:07:55,485
I'm Chu Yan. I'll triple that amount.

105
00:07:56,925 --> 00:08:00,165
Our boss said no matter
how much you offer,

106
00:08:00,245 --> 00:08:01,525
he'll triple it.

107
00:08:02,965 --> 00:08:05,405
Then I'll triple it again! And again!

108
00:08:05,845 --> 00:08:06,685
Hey!

109
00:08:16,885 --> 00:08:17,805
Eat.

110
00:08:23,205 --> 00:08:24,045
So good.

111
00:08:36,085 --> 00:08:38,245
-Why would she do something like that?
-I know.

112
00:08:39,205 --> 00:08:40,965
She sacrificed her own friend.

113
00:08:41,525 --> 00:08:42,804
Was it all for Director Ling?

114
00:08:48,765 --> 00:08:51,405
An Ran, I'm very honored that

115
00:08:51,485 --> 00:08:54,005
you went to all this trouble
just to frame me.

116
00:08:56,605 --> 00:08:57,965
Who do you think you are?

117
00:08:58,285 --> 00:09:01,845
If you hadn't stolen Yizhou away,
I'd never even glance in your direction.

118
00:09:02,205 --> 00:09:04,445
All for a man who doesn't belong to you?

119
00:09:05,765 --> 00:09:07,445
You've gone and ruined yourself.

120
00:09:08,405 --> 00:09:10,805
-Was it worth it?
-It doesn't matter.

121
00:09:11,605 --> 00:09:14,445
Even if there was only a 0.01% chance
of seeing you fall from grace,

122
00:09:14,525 --> 00:09:16,285
I'd still do everything I could.

123
00:09:16,525 --> 00:09:17,965
Yet in the end...

124
00:09:18,845 --> 00:09:21,005
Ling Yizhou is still my husband.

125
00:09:21,805 --> 00:09:23,765
Chu Yan is still my friend.

126
00:09:24,125 --> 00:09:27,405
The only person who fell from grace
and lost everything...

127
00:09:27,925 --> 00:09:28,885
is you.

128
00:09:34,085 --> 00:09:34,925
An Ran.

129
00:09:35,645 --> 00:09:37,165
Stop embarrassing yourself, OK?

130
00:09:37,525 --> 00:09:38,565
Embarrassing myself?

131
00:09:38,965 --> 00:09:40,605
You're the ones who have embarrassed me.

132
00:09:40,685 --> 00:09:41,525
An Ran!

133
00:09:42,605 --> 00:09:43,645
It is your own fault...

134
00:09:44,805 --> 00:09:46,125
that things have come to this.

135
00:09:49,005 --> 00:09:51,685
You and whoever put you up to this.

136
00:09:53,365 --> 00:09:54,685
The only thing you can do now is

137
00:09:55,365 --> 00:09:57,405
tell us who that person is.

138
00:09:58,005 --> 00:10:00,005
Even without me,
that person will make sure that

139
00:10:00,805 --> 00:10:03,125
you never live in peace.

140
00:10:05,765 --> 00:10:06,965
Step aside.

141
00:10:08,405 --> 00:10:09,445
Out of the way.

142
00:10:10,525 --> 00:10:15,685
An Ran, according to our investigation,
you're accused of arson and kidnapping.

143
00:10:15,765 --> 00:10:17,045
You're now under arrest.

144
00:10:17,805 --> 00:10:20,085
-Take her away.
-Quick, get a picture.

145
00:10:20,605 --> 00:10:22,125
This will make the headlines.

146
00:10:25,005 --> 00:10:26,245
Write this down.

147
00:10:26,325 --> 00:10:27,485
What huge news.

148
00:10:32,765 --> 00:10:34,965
-Director An...
-I got the picture!

149
00:10:37,525 --> 00:10:40,005
Mr. Wang, do you need
anything further from us?

150
00:10:40,085 --> 00:10:42,285
Mr. Chu should go and get some rest.

151
00:10:42,365 --> 00:10:44,485
Stop by tomorrow for a testimony.

152
00:10:46,285 --> 00:10:47,125
No problem.

153
00:10:57,765 --> 00:11:01,245
Chu Yan, maybe you should have
a checkup at the hospital.

154
00:11:01,325 --> 00:11:04,445
No, I don't miss that place at all.

155
00:11:04,725 --> 00:11:07,565
Come with us. We'll take care of you.

156
00:11:08,045 --> 00:11:09,165
Mrs. Ling,

157
00:11:09,565 --> 00:11:12,285
I just regained my freedom.
Give me some space, will you?

158
00:11:12,845 --> 00:11:15,285
Fine, don't come with us.

159
00:11:15,365 --> 00:11:17,165
We'll go with you. How about that?

160
00:11:17,485 --> 00:11:20,565
Ling, your wife is so clingy.

161
00:11:23,845 --> 00:11:25,005
A friend is waiting for me.

162
00:11:25,445 --> 00:11:26,565
You'll have to excuse me.

163
00:11:26,805 --> 00:11:27,725
Take care of yourself.

164
00:11:28,365 --> 00:11:29,485
-I'll get going then.
-Bye.

165
00:11:29,565 --> 00:11:30,485
Goodbye.

166
00:11:33,685 --> 00:11:35,445
Director Ling, where did Wen Li go?

167
00:11:36,565 --> 00:11:37,645
He's handling a few things.

168
00:11:38,485 --> 00:11:39,845
I'll be off then, too.

169
00:11:39,925 --> 00:11:41,165
I need to go pack my things.

170
00:11:41,725 --> 00:11:44,445
OK, let me know when you're going to move.

171
00:11:44,525 --> 00:11:46,445
-Got it, bye.
-Bye.

172
00:11:49,205 --> 00:11:50,325
She's moving out?

173
00:11:50,845 --> 00:11:53,565
Yeah, living with Wen Li
isn't very convenient for her.

174
00:11:53,805 --> 00:11:55,965
She's going to move
into that place we used to rent.

175
00:11:57,085 --> 00:11:57,925
Something wrong?

176
00:11:59,325 --> 00:12:00,165
Let's go.

177
00:12:04,445 --> 00:12:06,365
What? Cat got your tongue?

178
00:12:07,085 --> 00:12:09,365
You were pretty brave
when you gave me that ride.

179
00:12:20,965 --> 00:12:21,805
Who are you?

180
00:12:22,245 --> 00:12:23,725
Chu Yan, the superstar!

181
00:12:23,805 --> 00:12:25,165
Take a good look at me.

182
00:12:25,245 --> 00:12:26,885
But Chu Yan died in a fire.

183
00:12:27,445 --> 00:12:30,285
I don't have time to explain.
I'll pay you 100,000RMB to use your bike.

184
00:12:30,365 --> 00:12:33,085
Don't bother. I have food to deliver.

185
00:12:33,445 --> 00:12:34,765
200,000RMB! Just get on!

186
00:12:39,245 --> 00:12:41,005
-You'd better keep your word!
-Stay still!

187
00:12:41,085 --> 00:12:42,645
Stop moving around!

188
00:12:46,885 --> 00:12:47,765
So...

189
00:12:49,365 --> 00:12:50,965
you owe me twice as much.

190
00:12:52,085 --> 00:12:53,245
I can give you the money,

191
00:12:53,565 --> 00:12:56,125
but why do I feel like
I'm being blackmailed?

192
00:12:56,445 --> 00:12:59,325
You superstars all get
to live privileged lives.

193
00:12:59,725 --> 00:13:01,285
I'm just a Robin Hood.

194
00:13:02,605 --> 00:13:04,565
What are you going
to do with all that money?

195
00:13:04,645 --> 00:13:05,805
None of your concern.

196
00:13:06,125 --> 00:13:08,765
I only accept cash, by the way.

197
00:13:10,365 --> 00:13:12,845
Fine. Show me your ID.

198
00:13:13,365 --> 00:13:14,205
Why?

199
00:13:14,645 --> 00:13:15,965
I'm checking your ID.

200
00:13:16,285 --> 00:13:19,085
What if you're on the wanted list?
I'd become your accomplice.

201
00:13:24,565 --> 00:13:26,485
Fine. Look.

202
00:13:26,565 --> 00:13:28,005
-Did you catch that?
-Fine!

203
00:13:28,085 --> 00:13:28,965
Tong Xiaoyou, right?

204
00:13:30,165 --> 00:13:33,605
Add me on WeChat.
I'll contact you after I get the money.

205
00:13:40,165 --> 00:13:41,365
Tong Xiaoyou...

206
00:13:43,085 --> 00:13:48,045
Mr. Chu Yan owes
Miss Tong Xiaoyou 400,000RMB!

207
00:13:48,125 --> 00:13:50,925
This video is evidence.
Come on, give me a nod.

208
00:13:51,005 --> 00:13:52,085
Give me that!

209
00:13:53,565 --> 00:13:56,925
-You...
-Come and get it then.

210
00:13:57,325 --> 00:13:58,245
I'm telling you,

211
00:13:58,325 --> 00:14:01,725
royalties need to be paid
for videos and pictures of me. Delete it.

212
00:14:01,805 --> 00:14:03,125
It's a safety measure.

213
00:14:03,205 --> 00:14:05,445
If you don't pay up,
I'll post the video online.

214
00:14:05,525 --> 00:14:06,445
You...!

215
00:14:09,405 --> 00:14:10,845
Fine...

216
00:14:11,605 --> 00:14:12,685
Since you saved me,

217
00:14:12,765 --> 00:14:14,965
I won't argue with you.
Keep it as a souvenir.

218
00:14:15,045 --> 00:14:15,965
But...

219
00:14:18,405 --> 00:14:20,805
if you go around posting that
for no reason,

220
00:14:21,445 --> 00:14:23,765
I will hunt you down
wherever you are. Got it?

221
00:14:30,685 --> 00:14:32,005
Got it.

222
00:14:38,685 --> 00:14:40,205
The two best leftovers of the day.

223
00:14:40,685 --> 00:14:42,725
Consider it a gift from your creditor.

224
00:14:57,205 --> 00:14:58,685
Hey, what's up?

225
00:14:58,925 --> 00:15:02,125
<i>Mr. Ling, a car blocked our way.</i>
<i>Yang Tong got away.</i>

226
00:15:02,685 --> 00:15:04,005
Got it. Are you OK?

227
00:15:04,085 --> 00:15:05,565
<i>I'm fine. Just a scratch.</i>

228
00:15:06,205 --> 00:15:07,725
-Go get a checkup.
-<i>OK.</i>

229
00:15:11,405 --> 00:15:13,165
What happened?

230
00:15:15,365 --> 00:15:16,205
Mumu,

231
00:15:17,005 --> 00:15:19,005
regardless of whether it was
An Ran or Yang Tong,

232
00:15:19,565 --> 00:15:21,885
they were just pawns being sacrificed.

233
00:15:22,325 --> 00:15:23,965
This matter isn't over yet.

234
00:15:24,885 --> 00:15:28,445
All we did was get married.
Why do people hate us so much?

235
00:15:28,885 --> 00:15:30,645
It's not your fault. It's my problem.

236
00:15:31,725 --> 00:15:32,965
I'm sorry you got involved.

237
00:15:33,285 --> 00:15:34,165
Ling Yizhou,

238
00:15:34,565 --> 00:15:37,565
what if the stars
just weren't aligned for us?

239
00:15:38,005 --> 00:15:41,125
How could our marriage
bring so much disaster?

240
00:15:41,565 --> 00:15:42,845
I don't believe in that stuff.

241
00:15:43,845 --> 00:15:46,725
I believe in myself.
And I need you to, too.

242
00:15:47,365 --> 00:15:49,965
Believe in you?
Then we'd both be done for.

243
00:15:50,605 --> 00:15:52,645
You knew Chu Yan was alive, didn't you?

244
00:15:54,045 --> 00:15:56,285
Actually, you're the one
who reminded me that day.

245
00:15:57,045 --> 00:15:58,525
An Ran does hate me.

246
00:15:58,965 --> 00:16:01,685
She had the means and the motive, but...

247
00:16:02,365 --> 00:16:03,845
I just don't get it.

248
00:16:04,205 --> 00:16:06,005
How could she be so cruel to Chu Yan?

249
00:16:07,005 --> 00:16:08,525
This doesn't involve Chu Yan directly.

250
00:16:09,045 --> 00:16:10,765
He also loved An Ran like a sister.

251
00:16:11,925 --> 00:16:13,125
I know An Ran quite well.

252
00:16:13,645 --> 00:16:15,565
Even if she were to lose all her senses,

253
00:16:15,645 --> 00:16:17,565
she could never do something
so cruel to Chu Yan.

254
00:16:17,805 --> 00:16:18,725
Hello.

255
00:16:19,765 --> 00:16:21,285
I need to find out where someone is.

256
00:16:21,965 --> 00:16:22,885
Be discrete about it.

257
00:16:23,445 --> 00:16:28,485
I secretly looked for Chu Yan
and put on a show with the police,

258
00:16:29,445 --> 00:16:30,685
luring An Ran to come out.

259
00:16:31,765 --> 00:16:34,685
You didn't have to announce
our marriage to do that.

260
00:16:36,165 --> 00:16:38,725
It just upset more people
and now they hate us even more.

261
00:16:39,565 --> 00:16:41,725
It wasn't worth it. Can't you see that?

262
00:16:42,045 --> 00:16:45,685
If I did nothing
when my wife was in danger...

263
00:16:46,685 --> 00:16:47,765
would you still love me?

264
00:16:49,365 --> 00:16:51,245
Besides, I've wanted to do that
for a long time.

265
00:16:58,405 --> 00:17:00,245
Ling Yizhou, thank you.

266
00:17:03,085 --> 00:17:04,445
Did you know that...

267
00:17:06,285 --> 00:17:07,925
there's another way to say thank you?

268
00:17:33,565 --> 00:17:36,925
Chu Yan, I'm here
to take you home. Let's go.

269
00:17:39,325 --> 00:17:40,165
That's not my home.

270
00:17:42,165 --> 00:17:43,285
-Chu Yan.
-Sir.

271
00:17:47,845 --> 00:17:51,445
You've been through a lot. Come back home.

272
00:17:53,685 --> 00:17:55,445
Don't act like you're my father anymore.

273
00:17:56,165 --> 00:17:58,125
Ling Yizhou has told you
all you need to hear.

274
00:17:58,805 --> 00:17:59,725
Please leave.

275
00:18:03,965 --> 00:18:05,045
Sir...

276
00:18:05,725 --> 00:18:06,565
Sir!

277
00:18:06,845 --> 00:18:08,205
Sir! Sir!

278
00:18:10,445 --> 00:18:11,405
What's wrong with him?

279
00:18:11,485 --> 00:18:14,365
He was hospitalized for a heart attack
after what happened to you.

280
00:18:14,445 --> 00:18:15,405
He's still recovering.

281
00:18:16,085 --> 00:18:16,925
Sir.

282
00:18:28,165 --> 00:18:30,725
Chu Yan, come home with your dad.

283
00:18:31,885 --> 00:18:33,285
We'll talk once we get you home.

284
00:18:47,005 --> 00:18:49,085
If that's all, I'll get going now.

285
00:18:49,525 --> 00:18:52,725
Don't you want to hear about your mother?

286
00:19:02,885 --> 00:19:06,205
Your mother and I met on a business trip.

287
00:19:08,445 --> 00:19:10,725
It was love at first sight.

288
00:19:24,565 --> 00:19:26,125
To be with her,

289
00:19:27,085 --> 00:19:29,205
I hid the fact that I couldn't marry her.

290
00:19:30,765 --> 00:19:32,525
But right before you were born...

291
00:19:33,525 --> 00:19:35,805
she found out I was marrying
someone for my family.

292
00:19:36,925 --> 00:19:38,165
I never thought that...

293
00:19:39,245 --> 00:19:41,125
she would just abandon you and leave me

294
00:19:41,205 --> 00:19:43,205
while I was away on a business trip.

295
00:19:45,725 --> 00:19:48,525
I haven't heard from her since.

296
00:19:51,885 --> 00:19:53,165
I hated her cruelty.

297
00:19:54,485 --> 00:19:58,205
That's why I neglected you.

298
00:19:59,405 --> 00:20:01,725
I used my hatred of her...

299
00:20:03,285 --> 00:20:04,925
to numb my own remorse.

300
00:20:06,165 --> 00:20:08,085
I treated you both unfairly.

301
00:20:08,365 --> 00:20:09,205
Chu Yan...

302
00:20:10,605 --> 00:20:12,445
You are my only son.

303
00:20:13,925 --> 00:20:15,565
But you've lied to me my whole life.

304
00:20:18,525 --> 00:20:19,365
That's true.

305
00:20:20,645 --> 00:20:22,005
That's my fault.

306
00:20:33,165 --> 00:20:34,445
Heading out early?

307
00:20:35,445 --> 00:20:36,285
Yes.

308
00:20:36,805 --> 00:20:38,005
Have some breakfast first.

309
00:20:39,405 --> 00:20:40,645
-I'm not hungry.
-You...

310
00:20:43,125 --> 00:20:44,125
Just take care then.

311
00:20:47,605 --> 00:20:48,685
I'll be back for dinner.

312
00:20:56,765 --> 00:20:59,925
That's fantastic!
You two have finally made up.

313
00:21:00,725 --> 00:21:02,605
Are you happy? Or shocked?

314
00:21:02,845 --> 00:21:05,125
I'm so happy I could burst.

315
00:21:05,525 --> 00:21:08,205
Don't think I don't know
you're a double agent.

316
00:21:08,565 --> 00:21:12,005
It seems like you're on my team,
but you always speak up for him.

317
00:21:12,485 --> 00:21:14,805
Tell me, how did he bribe you?

318
00:21:16,925 --> 00:21:20,125
You've ruined Mr. Ling's reputation.

319
00:21:20,845 --> 00:21:23,605
He put up with
all that fiery public rage for you.

320
00:21:23,685 --> 00:21:25,565
If doing all that
can't win your love back,

321
00:21:25,645 --> 00:21:26,965
it just proves one thing.

322
00:21:27,045 --> 00:21:29,085
You have no conscience.

323
00:21:29,445 --> 00:21:31,085
Where did your conscience go, then?

324
00:21:31,165 --> 00:21:33,405
Wen Li took good care of you,

325
00:21:33,485 --> 00:21:35,445
but once he gets hurt, you move out.

326
00:21:36,045 --> 00:21:38,165
Hurt? Is he alright?

327
00:21:38,725 --> 00:21:41,445
He's fine. It was just a car accident.

328
00:21:46,725 --> 00:21:48,005
That must be the realtor.

329
00:21:52,325 --> 00:21:54,645
Sorry you had to come all this way.

330
00:21:55,485 --> 00:21:57,885
Not at all.
Here's the lease transfer contract.

331
00:21:57,965 --> 00:21:59,605
If you two could both sign here, please.

332
00:22:07,525 --> 00:22:08,645
What are you doing? Sign it!

333
00:22:14,245 --> 00:22:15,085
Thank you.

334
00:22:15,485 --> 00:22:18,085
If she has any problems,
she can contact you, right?

335
00:22:18,165 --> 00:22:19,565
Yes. I'll get going then.

336
00:22:19,645 --> 00:22:20,805
Alright. Goodbye.

337
00:22:26,965 --> 00:22:27,805
Let's go.

338
00:22:28,925 --> 00:22:30,645
-Where are we going?
-To visit a patient.

339
00:22:30,725 --> 00:22:31,565
Yes.

340
00:22:31,645 --> 00:22:33,885
Mrs. Ling doesn't know
that you bought the place.

341
00:22:33,965 --> 00:22:36,325
She had me bring over
a lease transfer contract for Miss Jia.

342
00:22:36,405 --> 00:22:38,325
Don't worry, Mr. Ling.
Mrs. Ling doesn't--

343
00:22:39,365 --> 00:22:41,805
Ling Yizhou! Is this the respect
and honesty you promised me?

344
00:22:41,885 --> 00:22:43,445
Your promises are worthless!

345
00:22:46,605 --> 00:22:47,565
Wait.

346
00:22:48,485 --> 00:22:49,325
Mr. Ling...

347
00:22:49,765 --> 00:22:52,165
We just talked about it.
Then he does this a few days later.

348
00:22:52,525 --> 00:22:54,165
How can I trust someone like that?

349
00:22:54,725 --> 00:22:57,845
Yeah, I guess he never keeps his word.

350
00:22:58,125 --> 00:23:00,325
But Wen Li is still
unwaveringly loyal to him.

351
00:23:01,125 --> 00:23:05,205
He said he'd change for me,
but he keeps doing stuff behind my back.

352
00:23:05,805 --> 00:23:07,325
Does he have schizophrenia?

353
00:23:09,125 --> 00:23:11,525
Maybe Wen Li is Mr. Ling's

354
00:23:11,605 --> 00:23:14,045
only honest relationship.

355
00:23:14,765 --> 00:23:15,605
Feifei.

356
00:23:16,285 --> 00:23:18,245
Why do you never shut up about Wen Li?

357
00:23:18,685 --> 00:23:21,365
What? I'm being mad at Mr. Ling with you.

358
00:23:34,245 --> 00:23:37,685
Mumu, I just didn't want you
to have to rent from someone.

359
00:23:38,445 --> 00:23:41,565
You're right.
I didn't think things through.

360
00:23:42,045 --> 00:23:42,925
Come back with me.

361
00:23:43,005 --> 00:23:43,925
No, Director Ling.

362
00:23:44,405 --> 00:23:46,165
I should thank you for your generosity.

363
00:23:46,245 --> 00:23:48,885
Now, I can live in my small apartment
with a sense of security.

364
00:23:49,325 --> 00:23:50,205
Have a great day.

365
00:23:52,645 --> 00:23:53,725
Come on.

366
00:23:58,845 --> 00:24:01,165
I just got to watch Mr. Ling get told off.

367
00:24:01,245 --> 00:24:02,885
I salute your courage, Mrs. Ling.

368
00:24:04,925 --> 00:24:06,045
Sir.

369
00:24:06,125 --> 00:24:07,605
Marriage requires management.

370
00:24:07,685 --> 00:24:10,325
If I don't tell him off this time,
things will just get worse.

371
00:24:11,365 --> 00:24:13,925
-Oh, no. Watch out.
-My apologies, sir.

372
00:24:14,485 --> 00:24:15,965
Please give me a few minutes.

373
00:24:16,045 --> 00:24:17,205
-What?
-Who is that?

374
00:24:17,405 --> 00:24:20,125
I'd like to take care
of a misunderstanding with my wife.

375
00:24:20,405 --> 00:24:23,285
If this leads to any loss for you,
do come find me at Lingshi Group.

376
00:24:24,605 --> 00:24:25,725
You!

377
00:24:27,205 --> 00:24:28,245
Put me down!

378
00:24:36,125 --> 00:24:37,165
Get in.

379
00:24:42,205 --> 00:24:46,165
I'm so jealous!
He's so handsome and romantic.

380
00:24:47,445 --> 00:24:48,965
You'll never get a man like that.

381
00:24:50,685 --> 00:24:51,925
Stop daydreaming.

382
00:24:53,725 --> 00:24:55,685
She never had a chance.

383
00:24:56,005 --> 00:24:57,725
You can't ever change men like that.

384
00:24:58,685 --> 00:25:01,125
Excuse me, driver.
I'd like to get off, too.

385
00:25:15,725 --> 00:25:16,565
Mumu.

386
00:25:18,365 --> 00:25:21,285
I didn't buy that apartment
to control you.

387
00:25:22,725 --> 00:25:25,285
I just wanted to make sure
you were comfortable.

388
00:25:28,445 --> 00:25:31,605
I promised I would respect you, so I will.

389
00:25:32,325 --> 00:25:35,605
But I hope you can give me
some time to adjust.

390
00:25:36,485 --> 00:25:38,565
Even if I'm still making some mistakes,

391
00:25:39,085 --> 00:25:41,405
there should be a grace period, right?

392
00:25:42,885 --> 00:25:45,725
Fine, I'll give you a chance.

393
00:25:47,285 --> 00:25:48,965
-But I have a few conditions.
-Such as?

394
00:25:51,725 --> 00:25:54,405
First, no interfering in my work life.

395
00:25:54,885 --> 00:25:58,525
That includes clear interference
and also hints from other people.

396
00:25:59,125 --> 00:25:59,965
Sure.

397
00:26:00,325 --> 00:26:04,245
Second, let me sleep in two days a week.

398
00:26:05,005 --> 00:26:06,645
You sleep in every day.

399
00:26:06,725 --> 00:26:10,245
The point is, on those two days,
I don't have to have breakfast with you.

400
00:26:10,605 --> 00:26:12,725
No, breakfast is important.

401
00:26:16,205 --> 00:26:17,045
Fine.

402
00:26:17,685 --> 00:26:19,845
I'll have Ms. Huang
keep you healthy another way.

403
00:26:21,765 --> 00:26:23,605
-Third, I--
-Oh, hush.

404
00:26:25,285 --> 00:26:28,445
These are all really extreme stipulations.
You should read them before signing.

405
00:26:29,165 --> 00:26:32,285
What my lady demands, I will accept.

406
00:26:34,485 --> 00:26:35,525
But now,

407
00:26:35,925 --> 00:26:37,805
can we do something even more important?

408
00:26:38,325 --> 00:26:39,165
What?

409
00:27:13,365 --> 00:27:14,925
Chu Yan, you're finally back.

410
00:27:15,005 --> 00:27:16,765
Your father has been waiting
to eat with you.

411
00:27:18,165 --> 00:27:19,245
Who told him to wait?

412
00:27:20,725 --> 00:27:21,565
You're home.

413
00:27:22,245 --> 00:27:23,805
Mr. Fu, bring out the food.

414
00:27:23,885 --> 00:27:25,485
Yes, sir. Have a seat.

415
00:27:28,605 --> 00:27:30,045
You're an old man.

416
00:27:30,485 --> 00:27:31,565
You shouldn't have waited.

417
00:27:33,365 --> 00:27:35,205
We haven't had a meal together in ages.

418
00:27:38,165 --> 00:27:39,445
This won't be the last time.

419
00:27:40,645 --> 00:27:42,565
Are you going to move back in?

420
00:27:43,285 --> 00:27:44,485
Have a seat.

421
00:27:46,605 --> 00:27:47,565
It depends on my mood.

422
00:27:50,685 --> 00:27:52,565
Mr. Fu, hurry. I'm starving!

423
00:27:53,925 --> 00:27:55,045
Coming.

424
00:27:59,125 --> 00:28:01,885
I heard you got hurt,
so I brought some stuff.

425
00:28:02,325 --> 00:28:04,205
Thank you. Have you eaten yet?

426
00:28:04,525 --> 00:28:05,645
I can make you something.

427
00:28:06,765 --> 00:28:09,525
You're injured, what can you cook?

428
00:28:09,845 --> 00:28:11,085
Do you want my pity?

429
00:28:12,165 --> 00:28:14,325
This is nothing, I can still do stuff.

430
00:28:14,645 --> 00:28:17,685
Stop it. You've cooked for me
so much in the past.

431
00:28:17,765 --> 00:28:19,925
So today, you're going
to let Chef Jia cook.

432
00:28:20,005 --> 00:28:21,045
You can cook?

433
00:28:22,245 --> 00:28:23,365
Drop that question mark.

434
00:28:29,285 --> 00:28:30,565
Lord, help us!

435
00:28:37,645 --> 00:28:38,685
Sorry...

436
00:28:39,085 --> 00:28:41,125
I really just wanted
to make you some food!

437
00:28:41,645 --> 00:28:43,805
I didn't think I'd set your house on fire.

438
00:28:44,285 --> 00:28:47,165
You almost set my house on fire.
I should be the one crying.

439
00:28:49,485 --> 00:28:51,525
No... Don't cry.

440
00:28:52,565 --> 00:28:53,925
As long as you're OK, it's fine.

441
00:28:54,405 --> 00:28:55,925
I'm so dumb.

442
00:28:56,245 --> 00:28:58,525
I don't even have basic life skills.

443
00:28:59,645 --> 00:29:00,485
But...

444
00:29:01,445 --> 00:29:04,245
people with basic life skills
aren't as joyful as you are.

445
00:29:07,885 --> 00:29:09,645
You earn a D on comforting.

446
00:29:13,645 --> 00:29:14,845
What are you going to do?

447
00:29:15,845 --> 00:29:16,885
Order takeout.

448
00:29:17,285 --> 00:29:19,765
I won't be cooking anymore, for sure.

449
00:29:21,205 --> 00:29:24,485
I'll get us some takeout for today.
Hope that's OK.

450
00:29:26,205 --> 00:29:28,045
Let me grab my phone.

451
00:29:51,925 --> 00:29:53,245
What time is it?

452
00:29:53,645 --> 00:29:54,565
Six o'clock.

453
00:29:55,165 --> 00:29:57,685
That early? Leave me alone.

454
00:29:58,605 --> 00:29:59,445
Mumu.

455
00:30:00,085 --> 00:30:02,245
What normally happens with a couple

456
00:30:02,725 --> 00:30:04,285
after they get married?

457
00:30:04,765 --> 00:30:05,845
They make a baby.

458
00:30:06,405 --> 00:30:07,885
That's a great idea.

459
00:30:10,645 --> 00:30:13,645
I'm still young.
I'm in no rush to be a mom.

460
00:30:13,725 --> 00:30:16,525
I'm not young anymore, though.
I'm ready to be a dad.

461
00:30:19,445 --> 00:30:20,525
I have a suggestion.

462
00:30:21,005 --> 00:30:21,885
Yes?

463
00:30:22,245 --> 00:30:24,725
I'll go to work with you today. OK?

464
00:30:26,445 --> 00:30:28,205
That does seem like a good idea.

465
00:30:29,965 --> 00:30:34,085
This will be my first time going
in as Mrs. Ling. I need to get ready.

466
00:30:43,005 --> 00:30:44,525
Make a baby...

467
00:31:05,645 --> 00:31:08,205
Mumu, stop looking at me like that.

468
00:31:10,725 --> 00:31:13,685
Beautiful things deserve to be admired.

469
00:31:14,165 --> 00:31:15,565
You're really asking for trouble.

470
00:31:17,845 --> 00:31:18,845
I'm sorry.

471
00:31:48,645 --> 00:31:49,725
Since you're so bored,

472
00:31:50,525 --> 00:31:52,525
why don't we try
something more interesting?

473
00:31:56,085 --> 00:31:56,925
What are you doing?

474
00:31:57,485 --> 00:31:58,725
I value efficiency.

475
00:31:59,085 --> 00:32:01,165
We can look at it together
to get it done faster.

476
00:32:03,765 --> 00:32:04,645
What's so funny?

477
00:32:05,525 --> 00:32:09,925
The last time we were both here
was to sign the contract.

478
00:32:10,285 --> 00:32:12,805
You were still a frigid director
to me back then.

479
00:32:13,725 --> 00:32:17,045
Time is just like a mirror,

480
00:32:17,445 --> 00:32:19,645
showing who you were before.

481
00:32:24,765 --> 00:32:25,765
Then, my lady...

482
00:32:27,005 --> 00:32:29,885
do you like me more before, or now?

483
00:32:31,565 --> 00:32:33,485
Both, I think.

484
00:32:34,165 --> 00:32:35,925
But I like this one more.

485
00:32:47,285 --> 00:32:48,125
Come in.

486
00:32:53,365 --> 00:32:55,325
Mrs. Ling, Director Ling.

487
00:32:55,805 --> 00:32:59,205
Regarding publicity for the 50th
anniversary celebration of Lingshi Group,

488
00:32:59,285 --> 00:33:01,565
we recommend that you make an appearance

489
00:33:01,845 --> 00:33:05,205
and do interviews with a number
of TV and printed news media.

490
00:33:05,805 --> 00:33:08,965
This not only will help you
move past recent negative coverage,

491
00:33:09,045 --> 00:33:11,165
it will also be
an excellent marketing opportunity.

492
00:33:11,925 --> 00:33:13,645
What does my wife think about it?

493
00:33:15,205 --> 00:33:18,205
I think this is an excellent chance
to clear up some misunderstandings.

494
00:33:19,045 --> 00:33:22,125
People who know you already understand.

495
00:33:22,485 --> 00:33:25,365
For people who don't,
it doesn't matter how much you explain it.

496
00:33:25,685 --> 00:33:27,005
My wife understands me.

497
00:33:28,405 --> 00:33:32,485
I never did those things in the past.
Nothing has changed now.

498
00:33:32,925 --> 00:33:34,445
Publicity is your thing.

499
00:33:34,925 --> 00:33:37,165
Just don't ask me to do stuff.

500
00:33:38,125 --> 00:33:39,405
By the way, Director Ling,

501
00:33:39,765 --> 00:33:42,805
there's also the more pressing issue
of promoting the newly-renovated stores.

502
00:33:42,885 --> 00:33:44,605
-Have you taken a look?
-I hired you all...

503
00:33:45,125 --> 00:33:47,285
so that you could give me good answers,

504
00:33:47,885 --> 00:33:50,165
not so I could help you
with every single detail.

505
00:33:50,245 --> 00:33:51,925
Redo it, and then notify me.

506
00:34:03,285 --> 00:34:06,805
Wen Li, Mrs. Ling is here.
We were too afraid to go into his office.

507
00:34:06,885 --> 00:34:08,485
Can you find out what's going on?

508
00:34:08,565 --> 00:34:12,245
Seriously, I didn't even say that much
and I got thrown out.

509
00:34:12,325 --> 00:34:15,565
He didn't even say anything
about promoting the renovated stores.

510
00:34:15,644 --> 00:34:17,965
Without any comments,
how will we know what to change?

511
00:34:18,285 --> 00:34:20,565
My report is still in there
awaiting approval.

512
00:34:20,845 --> 00:34:23,164
How are we supposed to start it
if he won't sign it?

513
00:34:23,965 --> 00:34:26,885
I understand your concerns.

514
00:34:28,244 --> 00:34:29,405
I'll do my best to help you.

515
00:34:31,325 --> 00:34:32,805
Lisa, I've missed you!

516
00:34:33,244 --> 00:34:35,125
<i>You've missed my job announcements.</i>

517
00:34:35,605 --> 00:34:37,644
Can I start working again?

518
00:34:38,164 --> 00:34:40,485
There's a young-teen romance drama
called <i>Only You</i>.

519
00:34:40,565 --> 00:34:41,965
They need someone who can dance.

520
00:34:42,485 --> 00:34:43,684
<i>You can make a cameo.</i>

521
00:34:44,605 --> 00:34:46,845
You need to be ready to shoot
at a moment's notice, though.

522
00:34:47,164 --> 00:34:49,045
Sure. Thank you, Lisa!

523
00:34:49,485 --> 00:34:52,204
It's just a minor role, calm down.

524
00:34:53,644 --> 00:34:55,805
There are only minor actors,
no minor roles.

525
00:34:55,885 --> 00:34:57,204
Even if it's just one scene,

526
00:34:57,285 --> 00:34:58,805
I will do my best to prepare!

527
00:34:59,204 --> 00:35:00,565
<i>I don't know what you're thinking.</i>

528
00:35:00,925 --> 00:35:02,485
You're already Mrs. Ling!

529
00:35:02,565 --> 00:35:04,605
But you're still going
after these D-list roles.

530
00:35:05,245 --> 00:35:08,445
You're above the showbiz industry
given your new status.

531
00:35:09,165 --> 00:35:11,605
Lisa, think of it this way.

532
00:35:11,805 --> 00:35:13,525
If I were a greedy and vain person,

533
00:35:13,765 --> 00:35:15,925
would Ling Yizhou even like me
in the first place?

534
00:35:16,485 --> 00:35:17,885
Fair enough.

535
00:35:18,485 --> 00:35:20,485
I sent you the script.
Practice your dancing.

536
00:35:20,565 --> 00:35:21,485
No problem.

537
00:35:26,885 --> 00:35:27,885
What are you doing there?

538
00:35:29,405 --> 00:35:30,325
Apologies, Mrs. Ling.

539
00:35:30,885 --> 00:35:32,485
I'd like to discuss something with you.

540
00:35:33,525 --> 00:35:34,845
Is it about Jia Fei?

541
00:35:35,165 --> 00:35:36,365
It's about Mr. Ling.

542
00:35:38,125 --> 00:35:42,045
On behalf of all the department heads
at Lingshi Group,

543
00:35:43,005 --> 00:35:46,765
please keep your interactions
with Mr. Ling to a minimum during work.

544
00:35:47,765 --> 00:35:51,165
This is my first day here
and they're complaining about me already?

545
00:35:51,565 --> 00:35:52,925
I didn't mean to provoke them.

546
00:35:54,085 --> 00:35:55,725
It's not anything you did, Mrs. Ling,

547
00:35:55,805 --> 00:35:58,165
just you seriously disrupt
Mr. Ling's usual workflow.

548
00:35:58,605 --> 00:36:01,565
It's indirectly caused a bit of trouble
for various departments.

549
00:36:01,645 --> 00:36:02,485
So...

550
00:36:14,845 --> 00:36:16,085
What took so long?

551
00:36:17,005 --> 00:36:19,445
Lisa just called me.

552
00:36:19,805 --> 00:36:22,125
She got me a new role.

553
00:36:22,685 --> 00:36:23,525
And?

554
00:36:24,245 --> 00:36:26,765
So I'll be busy starting tomorrow.

555
00:36:27,165 --> 00:36:29,845
You'd better keep working hard.
Earn money to support Mumu.

556
00:36:30,805 --> 00:36:32,045
And a little Mumu.

557
00:36:32,565 --> 00:36:33,525
Isn't that right?

558
00:36:35,525 --> 00:36:36,485
He says yes.

559
00:37:21,005 --> 00:37:22,645
What do you think? Am I any good?

560
00:37:23,445 --> 00:37:24,765
You? Or the dance?

561
00:37:25,845 --> 00:37:27,005
Is there a difference?

562
00:37:27,085 --> 00:37:28,765
Of course, the dance looked good.

563
00:37:29,525 --> 00:37:30,525
But you look even better.

564
00:37:31,245 --> 00:37:33,725
It's for the drama.

565
00:37:34,205 --> 00:37:35,445
I have to practice hard.

566
00:37:36,365 --> 00:37:39,445
You can't rush through it.
It's important to relax, too.

567
00:37:40,245 --> 00:37:41,725
-How?
-Chat with me.

568
00:37:42,045 --> 00:37:43,165
Just chat? Nothing else?

569
00:37:43,245 --> 00:37:44,205
You're avoiding me.

570
00:37:44,525 --> 00:37:46,485
This is for my acting career,
don't mess around.

571
00:37:46,565 --> 00:37:48,845
Go to bed now.

572
00:37:50,365 --> 00:37:51,205
Be good.

573
00:37:53,485 --> 00:37:55,605
Good boy. Get some rest.

574
00:38:10,045 --> 00:38:11,685
Time to relax?

575
00:38:12,485 --> 00:38:14,645
Lisa said we're shooting tomorrow.

576
00:38:15,165 --> 00:38:16,165
That soon?

577
00:38:16,805 --> 00:38:19,285
It's only a two-day shoot,
so it got pushed forward.

578
00:38:30,725 --> 00:38:33,125
Well, that's different from
what you've given me before.

579
00:38:33,605 --> 00:38:36,205
Is this a new low-key style of yours?

580
00:38:37,845 --> 00:38:39,165
Would you wear anything else?

581
00:38:40,365 --> 00:38:42,045
These aren't ordinary earrings.

582
00:38:42,285 --> 00:38:44,685
They have GPS microchips inside

583
00:38:44,765 --> 00:38:46,405
so I can locate you.

584
00:38:47,405 --> 00:38:49,805
I'm just filming a drama.
It's not a spy mission.

585
00:38:50,205 --> 00:38:51,805
This is a bit much.

586
00:38:51,885 --> 00:38:53,005
An Ran pleaded guilty,

587
00:38:53,605 --> 00:38:56,405
but we know that the person
behind all of this is still out there.

588
00:38:57,005 --> 00:38:59,485
Since you insist on working,
we should at least keep you safe.

589
00:39:02,365 --> 00:39:03,565
I'll give you a ride tomorrow.

590
00:39:05,245 --> 00:39:06,725
You're so nice, hubby.

591
00:39:44,565 --> 00:39:46,965
Hello?
Is this the great screenwriter, Miss Jia?

592
00:39:47,045 --> 00:39:48,725
I just got done filming.

593
00:39:49,325 --> 00:39:50,925
Do you have time

594
00:39:51,205 --> 00:39:52,685
to grab a bite with me?

595
00:39:52,765 --> 00:39:54,805
<i>I'm in the middle</i>
<i>of an investors' meeting.</i>

596
00:39:55,045 --> 00:39:56,365
<i>Go hang out with Mr. Ling.</i>

597
00:39:56,805 --> 00:39:58,605
Fine, I'll leave you be.

598
00:39:58,925 --> 00:40:01,165
Good luck to you.

599
00:40:01,245 --> 00:40:02,965
<i>OK, thank you. Bye.</i>

600
00:40:57,685 --> 00:40:59,445
Who are you? Why are you following me?

601
00:41:01,045 --> 00:41:03,405
I'm sorry,
I thought you were somebody else!

602
00:41:05,045 --> 00:41:06,165
Really?

603
00:41:08,005 --> 00:41:09,685
Don't worry, I mean no harm.

604
00:41:10,605 --> 00:41:13,165
You just look familiar.

605
00:41:13,845 --> 00:41:14,925
I look familiar?

606
00:41:22,325 --> 00:41:23,885
Did we meet in the hospital?

607
00:41:25,565 --> 00:41:27,645
No, we didn't.
This was a misunderstanding.

608
00:41:51,925 --> 00:41:55,725
I definitely saw her leave
Ling Yizhou's hospital room that time.

609
00:41:56,405 --> 00:41:57,965
They have to be connected somehow.

610
00:42:12,485 --> 00:42:13,445
Could she be...

611
00:42:23,725 --> 00:42:25,965
HEAD OF MARKETING: MRS. LING
IS MY MOTIVATION TO GO JOGGING

612
00:42:37,285 --> 00:42:38,125
Hello.

613
00:42:38,685 --> 00:42:41,605
Send the Head of Marketing to learn
some skills at the new subsidiary.

614
00:42:41,885 --> 00:42:44,085
<i>We have three new subsidiaries.</i>

615
00:42:44,405 --> 00:42:45,965
Pick whichever one in a different city.

616
00:42:46,045 --> 00:42:46,885
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

617
00:44:17,925 --> 00:44:19,685
Subtitle translation by Jake Eberts

618
00:44:19,765 --> 00:44:21,805
You know that Chu Yan likes you.

619
00:44:22,045 --> 00:44:23,005
You...

620
00:44:24,245 --> 00:44:27,365
I only noticed it
at the brand launch event.

621
00:44:28,485 --> 00:44:31,165
Even if you were
the last woman in the world...

622
00:44:32,285 --> 00:44:33,925
I'd rather be with Ling.

623
00:44:34,005 --> 00:44:35,765
Screw you. Ling Yizhou is mine.

624
00:44:35,845 --> 00:44:36,725
Mrs. Ling,

625
00:44:36,805 --> 00:44:41,165
nobody would hate their own mother
for no reason.

626
00:44:41,765 --> 00:44:43,845
Please leave right now.

627
00:44:46,005 --> 00:44:46,845
Now!
