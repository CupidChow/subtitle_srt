1
00:00:13,285 --> 00:00:15,205
You... Fire her for me.

2
00:00:18,405 --> 00:00:19,485
Right now.

3
00:00:21,244 --> 00:00:24,365
His amnesia might just be
a reaction to shock.

4
00:00:24,445 --> 00:00:27,125
Perhaps he'll be normal by tomorrow.

5
00:00:27,445 --> 00:00:29,885
Before I get my memory back,

6
00:00:29,965 --> 00:00:33,285
I hope we can live independently
and not interfere with each other.

7
00:00:33,565 --> 00:00:35,245
Mr. Ling lost his memory, right?

8
00:00:35,325 --> 00:00:36,845
This is the best time

9
00:00:36,925 --> 00:00:39,205
to annul your marriage contract.

10
00:00:39,725 --> 00:00:41,445
Get a divorce?

11
00:00:41,805 --> 00:00:46,485
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

12
00:02:12,445 --> 00:02:15,365
EPISODE 8

13
00:02:15,885 --> 00:02:17,725
You want to correct
your previous mistakes?

14
00:02:17,805 --> 00:02:18,725
Sure.

15
00:02:19,205 --> 00:02:21,125
Marrying me was your biggest mistake.

16
00:02:22,365 --> 00:02:24,645
Maybe we should just forget
this ever happened.

17
00:02:27,245 --> 00:02:28,245
What did you say?

18
00:02:30,125 --> 00:02:32,605
I know, I shouldn't be so emotional.

19
00:02:33,285 --> 00:02:35,725
But if I give up, they'd have it too easy.

20
00:02:41,605 --> 00:02:44,525
I know. He doesn't like you, right?

21
00:02:45,325 --> 00:02:48,245
I'll make him prove it himself.

22
00:02:52,125 --> 00:02:52,965
Hello.

23
00:02:53,965 --> 00:02:55,165
Can I help you?

24
00:02:55,725 --> 00:02:57,005
I'd like to ask about...

25
00:02:57,285 --> 00:02:58,525
This needs to be fixed.

26
00:02:59,165 --> 00:03:00,005
What's all this?

27
00:03:00,405 --> 00:03:01,285
Director Ling.

28
00:03:01,685 --> 00:03:04,965
The company lobby needs to be kept tidy.
Does this need to be said?

29
00:03:07,045 --> 00:03:09,125
Find out whose stuff this is
and get rid of it ASAP.

30
00:03:09,205 --> 00:03:11,245
The owner of this pile of stuff

31
00:03:11,325 --> 00:03:13,645
will have two points deducted
from their performance review.

32
00:03:14,285 --> 00:03:15,125
Yes, sir.

33
00:03:15,205 --> 00:03:18,085
But, Director Ling, this stuff is yours.

34
00:03:19,525 --> 00:03:20,365
Mine?

35
00:03:21,245 --> 00:03:24,405
Yes, your online supporters sent them.

36
00:03:25,125 --> 00:03:26,245
It's dog food.

37
00:03:36,565 --> 00:03:37,405
Get rid of it.

38
00:03:40,245 --> 00:03:42,005
Wen Li, what was
that all about downstairs?

39
00:03:42,085 --> 00:03:43,685
It might be your Weibo post yesterday.

40
00:03:45,165 --> 00:03:46,085
My Weibo post?

41
00:03:50,765 --> 00:03:52,085
<i>He looks like you.</i>

42
00:03:52,165 --> 00:03:54,405
<i>-Yeah, just like his dad!</i>
-<i>Too cute!</i>

43
00:03:54,485 --> 00:03:56,165
Your Weibo post
is now on Weibo Hot Search.

44
00:03:56,885 --> 00:03:59,125
People are excited to find out
that you have a dog.

45
00:03:59,365 --> 00:04:01,565
And the address of Gangdong Tower
is public information.

46
00:04:01,645 --> 00:04:02,885
-<i>Get out my way.</i>
-That's why...

47
00:04:02,965 --> 00:04:04,685
<i>I'm gonna send my boy some dog food!</i>

48
00:04:05,805 --> 00:04:07,645
You mean I posted this on Weibo?

49
00:04:08,405 --> 00:04:10,685
Your wife manages your Weibo account.

50
00:04:22,885 --> 00:04:24,365
You're here at the office?

51
00:04:25,125 --> 00:04:28,365
What if Ling kicks
that dog out of the house?

52
00:04:29,765 --> 00:04:31,565
Do you not follow his Weibo account?

53
00:04:32,085 --> 00:04:34,085
Pidan is his dog now.

54
00:04:35,605 --> 00:04:36,445
Nice.

55
00:04:37,245 --> 00:04:39,005
But now you've upset Ling.

56
00:04:39,645 --> 00:04:41,605
That makes regaining his affection

57
00:04:41,685 --> 00:04:44,085
pretty much impossible.

58
00:04:44,725 --> 00:04:47,005
When did I say I wanted
to regain his affection?

59
00:04:48,965 --> 00:04:52,765
I wonder who was reading
<i>Thirty-six Strategies to Get a Guy</i>.

60
00:04:54,245 --> 00:04:56,045
I was going to share some tips...

61
00:04:56,125 --> 00:04:58,405
Never mind then.

62
00:05:03,765 --> 00:05:04,805
What tips?

63
00:05:09,445 --> 00:05:11,125
What was that? I didn't hear you.

64
00:05:11,725 --> 00:05:13,405
I said, what tips do you have?

65
00:05:15,125 --> 00:05:16,405
You want me to help you?

66
00:05:17,845 --> 00:05:18,805
Beg me.

67
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:28,005
Chu Yan, please help me.
Let's take a photo and send it to Yizhou.

68
00:05:28,085 --> 00:05:29,845
Maybe he'll get better right away.

69
00:05:31,325 --> 00:05:32,685
Fine!

70
00:05:33,725 --> 00:05:34,645
You're scaring me.

71
00:05:39,165 --> 00:05:40,565
Please start your lesson.

72
00:05:44,125 --> 00:05:48,005
Have you ever heard of
Stained Clothes Eighteen Falls?

73
00:06:01,205 --> 00:06:04,565
Wen Li prepares all his clothes.
I never deal with that.

74
00:06:05,845 --> 00:06:07,725
You're his wife,

75
00:06:07,805 --> 00:06:09,885
but his assistant prepares his clothes?

76
00:06:09,965 --> 00:06:12,085
How is that right?
Why does he need a wife then?

77
00:06:13,045 --> 00:06:15,925
But I don't know his size.

78
00:06:16,685 --> 00:06:19,165
His size? If you don't know it,
go measure him then.

79
00:06:19,885 --> 00:06:21,005
The point isn't his size.

80
00:06:21,925 --> 00:06:23,325
The point is...

81
00:06:24,365 --> 00:06:25,325
touch.

82
00:06:37,005 --> 00:06:37,845
Yes?

83
00:06:38,885 --> 00:06:41,565
I need to get your measurements
to buy you clothes.

84
00:06:43,085 --> 00:06:45,805
My clothes are all tailor-made.
I have plenty already.

85
00:06:46,725 --> 00:06:49,085
If you don't let me do it,
I'll keep standing here.

86
00:06:50,645 --> 00:06:51,485
Suit yourself.

87
00:06:55,885 --> 00:06:58,205
I can do this in five minutes and leave.

88
00:06:58,285 --> 00:07:00,605
Or I could stand here
and stare at you all night.

89
00:07:02,165 --> 00:07:03,165
Hurry up then.

90
00:07:03,645 --> 00:07:04,605
OK...

91
00:07:05,005 --> 00:07:07,045
Arms up. Lift them up.

92
00:07:10,725 --> 00:07:14,445
<i>Wow. He's so fit.</i>

93
00:07:15,085 --> 00:07:17,685
<i>When you look at him,</i>
<i>tilt your head eight degrees to the left.</i>

94
00:07:18,085 --> 00:07:21,725
Your eyes will look bigger,
and you'll be 20% cuter.

95
00:07:22,325 --> 00:07:23,205
Are your eyes OK?

96
00:07:27,965 --> 00:07:28,805
Other side.

97
00:07:34,485 --> 00:07:35,445
Hurry up.

98
00:07:35,525 --> 00:07:37,645
Calm down. I have to get it right.

99
00:07:39,325 --> 00:07:41,005
-Done?
-Not yet.

100
00:07:48,005 --> 00:07:49,005
What are you doing?

101
00:07:49,085 --> 00:07:50,285
Do you know how to measure?

102
00:07:50,365 --> 00:07:51,485
How do you measure then?

103
00:08:01,765 --> 00:08:04,005
You want to take off your shirt?

104
00:08:05,045 --> 00:08:05,925
OK, that works.

105
00:08:06,605 --> 00:08:08,365
It'll be even more precise.

106
00:08:15,325 --> 00:08:17,685
You need my help? Sure. I'm coming.

107
00:08:18,085 --> 00:08:18,925
What are you doing?

108
00:08:20,445 --> 00:08:22,365
I don't want to waste time on this.

109
00:08:23,085 --> 00:08:24,965
If you want to know my size,
go ask Wen Li.

110
00:08:39,085 --> 00:08:41,885
So? Did it work?

111
00:08:42,205 --> 00:08:43,564
It was a complete failure.

112
00:08:43,645 --> 00:08:46,005
I didn't even start
the Stained Clothes Eighteen Falls yet.

113
00:08:47,245 --> 00:08:49,164
<i>Such a beautiful image,</i>
<i>I dare not imagine it.</i>

114
00:08:49,965 --> 00:08:51,645
Your method must be wrong.

115
00:08:51,725 --> 00:08:53,485
Or could there be
a problem with my execution?

116
00:08:54,205 --> 00:08:55,445
<i>Are you trying to help or not?</i>

117
00:08:56,685 --> 00:08:58,325
Sorry. My bad.

118
00:08:58,765 --> 00:09:00,285
I didn't think that,

119
00:09:00,365 --> 00:09:03,285
as a woman,
you are not attractive to Ling at all.

120
00:09:04,405 --> 00:09:07,845
<i>We'll have to try a different approach.</i>
<i>Being a good wife.</i>

121
00:09:10,525 --> 00:09:11,445
How do I do that?

122
00:09:11,925 --> 00:09:14,245
<i>You know what they say,</i>
<i>the way to a man's heart</i>

123
00:09:14,845 --> 00:09:16,365
<i>is through his stomach.</i>

124
00:09:17,005 --> 00:09:18,325
So now...

125
00:09:19,365 --> 00:09:20,205
Hello?

126
00:09:20,285 --> 00:09:21,685
CHU YAN

127
00:09:22,445 --> 00:09:24,765
<i>-Miss Xia Lin?</i>
-Huh?

128
00:09:33,365 --> 00:09:34,485
You really are a pig.

129
00:10:06,005 --> 00:10:08,285
My priority now is to be with you.

130
00:10:08,645 --> 00:10:09,725
Do you like it?

131
00:10:10,525 --> 00:10:14,525
I arranged all this for you.

132
00:10:17,405 --> 00:10:18,365
Are you OK?

133
00:10:21,005 --> 00:10:22,925
-I had someone take these photos?
-Yes.

134
00:10:23,885 --> 00:10:26,405
You loved your wife dearly
before you lost your memory.

135
00:10:41,645 --> 00:10:43,245
CHU YAN
CALL DURATION 7:13:21

136
00:11:00,685 --> 00:11:01,565
It's five o'clock.

137
00:11:02,325 --> 00:11:04,085
<i>You're crazy, Xia Lin.</i>

138
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:08,125
Chu Yan?

139
00:11:08,965 --> 00:11:10,725
You're the crazy one!
Why didn't you hang up?

140
00:11:11,325 --> 00:11:13,365
<i>Do you know how much money you wasted?</i>

141
00:11:13,965 --> 00:11:17,565
You were snoring yesterday, miss.

142
00:11:20,405 --> 00:11:21,605
That's impossible.

143
00:11:22,045 --> 00:11:23,245
<i>I recorded it.</i>

144
00:11:25,805 --> 00:11:27,605
You're insane.

145
00:11:32,325 --> 00:11:34,165
Since you're so cute...

146
00:11:35,445 --> 00:11:37,405
I guess I'll help you.

147
00:11:37,685 --> 00:11:39,045
I'll help you...

148
00:11:41,845 --> 00:11:44,365
What did he say last night?

149
00:11:47,765 --> 00:11:50,165
The way to a man's heart
is through his stomach.

150
00:11:53,685 --> 00:11:55,405
This is a medicinal rib stew.

151
00:11:55,485 --> 00:11:57,805
It's got jujube fruit
and goji berries in it.

152
00:11:58,405 --> 00:11:59,525
This is black rice porridge.

153
00:12:00,045 --> 00:12:01,565
These are boiled eggs.

154
00:12:01,885 --> 00:12:03,485
I only drink black coffee for breakfast.

155
00:12:03,805 --> 00:12:05,405
It's good to mix things up sometimes.

156
00:12:05,485 --> 00:12:08,085
You've just recovered,
your body needs nutrients.

157
00:12:08,445 --> 00:12:11,605
Not to mention,
in order to make you all this food,

158
00:12:11,685 --> 00:12:13,205
I had to get up at five o'clock.

159
00:12:14,005 --> 00:12:14,845
Try it.

160
00:12:27,845 --> 00:12:29,045
Have you tried it?

161
00:12:29,125 --> 00:12:31,845
No, but it smells good.

162
00:12:32,525 --> 00:12:33,485
It is good, isn't it?

163
00:12:34,085 --> 00:12:36,845
You said this is medicinal?

164
00:12:37,685 --> 00:12:39,205
Don't worry, I looked it all up.

165
00:12:39,285 --> 00:12:41,605
The ingredients are
all good for your brain.

166
00:12:41,685 --> 00:12:42,805
They're good for you.

167
00:12:42,885 --> 00:12:44,525
Good for my brain?

168
00:12:47,765 --> 00:12:48,885
Mr. Wen is here.

169
00:12:48,965 --> 00:12:50,765
I made some medicinal soup, have some!

170
00:12:52,045 --> 00:12:52,885
Here you go.

171
00:12:53,685 --> 00:12:54,685
Thank you, Mrs. Ling.

172
00:12:57,885 --> 00:12:59,005
-Is it good?
-Is it good?

173
00:13:01,445 --> 00:13:03,045
It's very... interesting.

174
00:13:10,485 --> 00:13:12,605
You spent so long making this,
try it yourself.

175
00:13:12,685 --> 00:13:13,525
Here.

176
00:13:13,965 --> 00:13:17,005
We have a guest, you shouldn't--

177
00:13:21,205 --> 00:13:22,645
How is it? Tasty?

178
00:13:27,725 --> 00:13:29,125
Now that I've tasted it,

179
00:13:29,205 --> 00:13:31,245
it's actually a lot like coffee.

180
00:13:34,005 --> 00:13:35,405
Wen Li, what's on my agenda today?

181
00:13:36,205 --> 00:13:38,085
Lingshi's quarterly report in the morning.

182
00:13:38,285 --> 00:13:41,085
At 2:00 p.m., the international company
asked for a video conference.

183
00:13:41,165 --> 00:13:42,045
Oh, right.

184
00:13:42,125 --> 00:13:44,485
The Planning Division
set up a Celebrity Jog event.

185
00:13:44,565 --> 00:13:46,165
They're reporting to you this morning.

186
00:13:46,245 --> 00:13:47,445
What's a Celebrity Jog?

187
00:13:47,525 --> 00:13:49,485
-Will there be lots of stars?
-Yes, ma'am.

188
00:13:50,165 --> 00:13:52,365
-That's good media exposure, I should--
-Forget about it.

189
00:13:52,645 --> 00:13:53,525
Why?

190
00:13:55,485 --> 00:13:57,285
Lingshi Group has high standards.

191
00:13:59,965 --> 00:14:01,045
We'll see about that.

192
00:14:04,045 --> 00:14:04,885
Wen Li.

193
00:14:05,405 --> 00:14:07,165
Apparently this soup
is good for your brain.

194
00:14:07,565 --> 00:14:09,445
You should finish the whole thing.

195
00:14:10,885 --> 00:14:12,125
Sir, we're going to be late.

196
00:14:15,645 --> 00:14:18,405
-Lisa! Lisa!
-I don't have any roles for you.

197
00:14:18,725 --> 00:14:19,845
I know.

198
00:14:19,925 --> 00:14:21,205
I just wanted to ask you,

199
00:14:21,285 --> 00:14:24,085
Lingshi Group is holding
a Celebrity Jog, right?

200
00:14:24,405 --> 00:14:26,045
You're quite well-informed.

201
00:14:26,125 --> 00:14:28,045
You heard about it from Chu Yan,
didn't you?

202
00:14:28,725 --> 00:14:30,805
Who is our company sending?

203
00:14:31,125 --> 00:14:33,245
Since Yin Shuangshuang
is their spokeswoman,

204
00:14:33,325 --> 00:14:35,085
we do have five spots.

205
00:14:35,965 --> 00:14:37,285
But you won't be able to go.

206
00:14:38,085 --> 00:14:41,045
Perhaps Chu Yan can help you out.

207
00:14:42,805 --> 00:14:44,965
We're not dating!

208
00:14:46,365 --> 00:14:49,405
Have you heard about Xing An
Entertainment's An Ran and Director Ling?

209
00:14:50,365 --> 00:14:51,925
Ms. Shuangshuang will be so sad.

210
00:14:52,005 --> 00:14:53,365
She's always wanted to marry rich.

211
00:14:53,645 --> 00:14:55,645
Not anyone can be Mrs. Ling.

212
00:14:55,725 --> 00:14:58,165
I heard that An Ran
and Director Ling grew up together.

213
00:14:58,245 --> 00:14:59,485
Right?

214
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:01,645
How could the Director of Lingshi Group

215
00:15:01,725 --> 00:15:03,245
marry an actress?

216
00:15:03,325 --> 00:15:04,885
Similar backgrounds are key for a match.

217
00:15:07,245 --> 00:15:08,445
They don't suit each other.

218
00:15:13,285 --> 00:15:14,845
I mean...

219
00:15:15,645 --> 00:15:18,685
We live in a different era.
Background isn't everything anymore.

220
00:15:19,245 --> 00:15:21,085
And what's wrong with being an actress?

221
00:15:21,525 --> 00:15:23,485
It's an honest, hardworking job.

222
00:15:23,565 --> 00:15:25,165
So what if An Ran is from a rich family?

223
00:15:25,725 --> 00:15:29,005
Shuangshuang is pretty
and has a nice figure.

224
00:15:29,325 --> 00:15:30,725
She's kind and friendly.

225
00:15:31,245 --> 00:15:35,805
I think she's a lot better than An Ran
from Xing An Entertainment.

226
00:15:46,925 --> 00:15:47,885
Ms. Shuangshuang.

227
00:15:51,685 --> 00:15:54,765
Do you really think that?

228
00:15:55,365 --> 00:15:56,565
I do.

229
00:15:59,245 --> 00:16:00,605
Want to join the Celebrity Jog?

230
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:26,325
Can I help you?

231
00:16:27,085 --> 00:16:28,085
Nope.

232
00:16:29,205 --> 00:16:31,045
I just wanted to let you know that

233
00:16:31,725 --> 00:16:33,285
I, Xia Lin...

234
00:16:34,085 --> 00:16:37,325
will be attending
Lingshi Group's Celebrity Jog.

235
00:16:38,205 --> 00:16:40,045
Lingshi has high standards,

236
00:16:40,565 --> 00:16:43,285
but I happen to meet them all.

237
00:16:48,165 --> 00:16:49,125
Hello.

238
00:16:49,405 --> 00:16:50,245
Yes.

239
00:16:50,725 --> 00:16:52,365
About the Celebrity Jog,

240
00:16:52,445 --> 00:16:54,365
-one of the participants, Xia Lin...
-Hey!

241
00:16:54,765 --> 00:16:55,805
-Yes.
-What are you doing?

242
00:16:56,245 --> 00:16:58,165
Give me that phone.

243
00:17:04,405 --> 00:17:05,445
You tricked me?

244
00:17:10,324 --> 00:17:12,925
-You should drop out yourself.
-Why?

245
00:17:13,445 --> 00:17:16,285
Because it will be embarrassing
seeing you get last place.

246
00:17:16,844 --> 00:17:18,045
So you're coming tomorrow?

247
00:17:18,124 --> 00:17:20,084
If you come,
I definitely won't finish last.

248
00:17:20,485 --> 00:17:22,685
-I have to work.
-Then why does it matter to you?

249
00:17:28,124 --> 00:17:31,205
Do you remember me now?

250
00:17:50,885 --> 00:17:53,765
Go, Chu Yan, go!

251
00:17:53,845 --> 00:17:56,165
Go, Shuangshuang, go!

252
00:17:56,245 --> 00:17:57,125
Hold it.

253
00:17:59,205 --> 00:18:03,445
I heard you got a spot
by sucking up to Yin Shuangshuang.

254
00:18:03,925 --> 00:18:06,325
Wow. That's impressive.

255
00:18:09,405 --> 00:18:12,045
Hey, is this how you treat
your consultant?

256
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:13,965
Consultant?

257
00:18:15,245 --> 00:18:16,525
I almost forgot about that.

258
00:18:17,045 --> 00:18:18,325
You're a terrible consultant.

259
00:18:18,805 --> 00:18:19,845
Your ideas are lousy.

260
00:18:20,965 --> 00:18:22,565
Regardless of that, I still helped you.

261
00:18:22,645 --> 00:18:24,325
You shouldn't take me for granted.

262
00:18:28,645 --> 00:18:31,085
Why are you staring at me? Enchanted?

263
00:18:32,245 --> 00:18:34,405
Don't you have asthma? Can you even run?

264
00:18:35,725 --> 00:18:39,085
For these events,
I just show up and get my photo taken.

265
00:18:39,445 --> 00:18:41,045
-Do you really plan to run?
-Of course.

266
00:18:41,125 --> 00:18:43,005
I'm not only going to run,
I'm going to win.

267
00:18:43,325 --> 00:18:44,405
I want media exposure!

268
00:18:44,925 --> 00:18:46,045
Xia Lin, come over here.

269
00:18:49,565 --> 00:18:50,445
Hi!

270
00:18:52,845 --> 00:18:53,965
No need to thank me.

271
00:18:54,045 --> 00:18:55,485
I was just doing you a favor.

272
00:18:56,285 --> 00:18:57,125
What?

273
00:18:58,405 --> 00:19:02,285
I'm talking about Xia Lin.
Even if I didn't help her,

274
00:19:02,365 --> 00:19:04,645
she would have gotten
a spot from you anyway.

275
00:19:05,405 --> 00:19:06,525
Miss,

276
00:19:06,605 --> 00:19:08,445
did you not read my Weibo statement?

277
00:19:09,965 --> 00:19:12,845
I can make 18 of those statements
in a single day.

278
00:19:12,925 --> 00:19:14,245
Do they mean anything?

279
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:17,485
What are you trying to say?

280
00:19:18,965 --> 00:19:23,165
I knew that Xia Lin was your type
the first time I saw her.

281
00:19:23,245 --> 00:19:25,245
I guess I got it right.

282
00:19:26,045 --> 00:19:28,525
I'm not blind. Why would I be into her?

283
00:19:29,165 --> 00:19:30,725
Stop pretending.

284
00:19:31,325 --> 00:19:32,805
If you aren't dating her,

285
00:19:33,445 --> 00:19:34,845
how would Director Ling know her?

286
00:19:37,285 --> 00:19:39,645
Don't worry. I'll keep it a secret.

287
00:19:47,445 --> 00:19:49,525
Ready, set, go!

288
00:20:00,805 --> 00:20:03,805
A partner firm has reported our
electronics for regulatory noncompliance.

289
00:20:03,885 --> 00:20:07,085
We have presented quality test reports
and filed a case in court.

290
00:20:07,685 --> 00:20:09,525
You should drop out yourself.

291
00:20:09,605 --> 00:20:10,445
Why?

292
00:20:10,805 --> 00:20:13,805
Because it will be embarrassing
seeing you get last place.

293
00:20:14,245 --> 00:20:15,445
So you're coming tomorrow?

294
00:20:15,525 --> 00:20:17,965
If you come,
I definitely won't finish last.

295
00:20:18,045 --> 00:20:20,605
They have gone to the media
with false misleading stories.

296
00:20:20,685 --> 00:20:23,805
Misconceptions about our products
are spreading online.

297
00:20:24,405 --> 00:20:27,445
Do you remember me now?

298
00:20:28,925 --> 00:20:29,765
Director Ling.

299
00:20:33,925 --> 00:20:34,765
Director Ling?

300
00:20:36,525 --> 00:20:37,605
Sir.

301
00:20:42,845 --> 00:20:43,765
Go on.

302
00:20:44,965 --> 00:20:48,245
Misconceptions about our products
are spreading online.

303
00:20:48,325 --> 00:20:49,765
Misconceptions...

304
00:20:50,565 --> 00:20:53,765
Have experts from the Quality Supervision
Administration test our products.

305
00:20:53,845 --> 00:20:57,165
Invite the media to come and stream
the process to prove our quality.

306
00:20:58,125 --> 00:21:00,325
You just told me
that Weibo is very influential.

307
00:21:00,405 --> 00:21:02,005
Why do I need to teach you what to do?

308
00:21:03,765 --> 00:21:05,005
Get out.

309
00:21:13,165 --> 00:21:14,005
Wen Li.

310
00:21:14,525 --> 00:21:16,125
-Wen Li.
-Sir.

311
00:21:16,885 --> 00:21:18,205
When does the Celebrity Jog start?

312
00:21:18,285 --> 00:21:20,485
At 2:30 in the afternoon.
Are you going to attend?

313
00:21:21,285 --> 00:21:24,205
If you are, we'll have to clear the place.
There'll be lots of reporters.

314
00:21:26,565 --> 00:21:27,565
Yizhou.

315
00:21:28,965 --> 00:21:30,085
An Ran, why are you here?

316
00:21:30,565 --> 00:21:32,765
I can't just come and see you?

317
00:21:33,005 --> 00:21:36,285
I've been helping my dad
at the company lately.

318
00:21:36,365 --> 00:21:37,325
Did you miss me?

319
00:21:38,965 --> 00:21:40,445
Quite a lot of thoughts you have.

320
00:21:40,845 --> 00:21:43,205
I heard your company
is hosting a jog event.

321
00:21:43,605 --> 00:21:45,725
Let's go join in the fun.

322
00:21:46,245 --> 00:21:47,805
Look how nice the weather is.

323
00:21:51,125 --> 00:21:51,965
Sure.

324
00:21:53,005 --> 00:21:53,845
Let's go.

325
00:22:19,445 --> 00:22:20,445
Are you OK?

326
00:22:20,525 --> 00:22:22,685
Don't keep going if you need to stop.

327
00:22:23,405 --> 00:22:24,685
Don't worry about me.

328
00:22:24,765 --> 00:22:27,125
You're running so slow
that you'll surely make the news.

329
00:22:27,885 --> 00:22:30,605
Lisa said Ms. Shuangshuang
is set up to get first place.

330
00:22:30,685 --> 00:22:33,685
But if you collapse
and I'm the first to save you,

331
00:22:33,765 --> 00:22:35,205
I'll get even more media exposure.

332
00:22:36,325 --> 00:22:37,805
Why didn't you do that at the movies?

333
00:22:38,165 --> 00:22:41,005
I was too worried, I forgot.
I'll seize the opportunity next time.

334
00:22:41,245 --> 00:22:42,725
We've just received word that

335
00:22:42,805 --> 00:22:44,965
the Director of Lingshi Group
has arrived at the event.

336
00:22:45,045 --> 00:22:47,525
He will be awarding
the top three runners himself.

337
00:22:50,445 --> 00:22:51,605
Why are you looking at me?

338
00:22:51,685 --> 00:22:53,445
I can't help you get top three.
Start running!

339
00:22:54,805 --> 00:22:55,805
Take your time.

340
00:22:56,165 --> 00:22:57,725
Stop and rest if you feel bad.

341
00:23:00,205 --> 00:23:01,325
Take care of yourself.

342
00:23:01,965 --> 00:23:02,925
Hello, Chu Yan.

343
00:23:03,005 --> 00:23:05,365
Why did you decide
to participate in this event?

344
00:23:07,085 --> 00:23:08,045
Well, this event

345
00:23:08,125 --> 00:23:11,605
aims to promote a greener,
livelier understanding of health.

346
00:23:54,325 --> 00:23:55,605
So Xia Lin is here, too.

347
00:24:07,365 --> 00:24:08,365
CELEBRITY JOG
FIRST PLACE

348
00:24:17,525 --> 00:24:20,045
You run pretty fast
with your short little legs.

349
00:24:20,445 --> 00:24:21,765
Back off a bit.

350
00:24:21,845 --> 00:24:23,885
What if someone gets a photo of us?

351
00:24:24,325 --> 00:24:25,965
Since you still don't remember me,

352
00:24:26,045 --> 00:24:28,845
I have to remind you that we agreed
to keep our marriage secret.

353
00:24:28,925 --> 00:24:30,365
Is being married to me embarrassing?

354
00:24:32,005 --> 00:24:33,485
You asked me that before, too.

355
00:24:35,805 --> 00:24:37,165
Wen Li has cleared the area.

356
00:24:37,605 --> 00:24:39,565
Photos taken here won't be leaked.

357
00:24:40,365 --> 00:24:41,925
I thought you said you weren't coming.

358
00:24:42,405 --> 00:24:44,965
You didn't have to surprise me.
Just say you want to come see me.

359
00:24:45,165 --> 00:24:46,125
I came with An Ran.

360
00:24:48,245 --> 00:24:49,565
Thanks for reminding me of her.

361
00:24:49,645 --> 00:24:50,645
I'm warning you,

362
00:24:50,725 --> 00:24:52,205
you shouldn't cheat on me.

363
00:24:52,685 --> 00:24:54,925
I can sue you for everything you've got.

364
00:24:55,005 --> 00:24:56,765
Want me to get you a lawyer, Mrs. Ling?

365
00:24:57,925 --> 00:24:59,645
Ms. Shuangshuang, let's get a picture!

366
00:25:02,245 --> 00:25:03,765
Xia Lin, there you are.

367
00:25:04,085 --> 00:25:06,005
Ling, I need to borrow your wife
for a second.

368
00:25:10,085 --> 00:25:11,405
Director, what brings you here?

369
00:25:11,485 --> 00:25:13,445
-What are you doing?
-There are reporters there.

370
00:25:13,525 --> 00:25:15,245
Did you forget about Yin Shuangshuang?

371
00:25:15,845 --> 00:25:16,685
What do you mean?

372
00:25:16,965 --> 00:25:18,965
She was supposed to get first place.
You stole it.

373
00:25:19,045 --> 00:25:20,645
Then you go talk to Ling.

374
00:25:20,965 --> 00:25:22,445
That's like suicide for your career.

375
00:25:22,525 --> 00:25:25,245
That's right! I completely forgot.

376
00:25:26,365 --> 00:25:27,285
It's fine.

377
00:25:27,765 --> 00:25:29,725
She thinks the two of us are dating.

378
00:25:29,805 --> 00:25:31,045
Look over here, please.

379
00:25:31,125 --> 00:25:31,965
Look over here.

380
00:25:32,525 --> 00:25:34,045
Good, thank you.

381
00:25:34,325 --> 00:25:36,885
-Smile!
-Excuse me. I have to get going now.

382
00:25:37,485 --> 00:25:38,405
Bye, Director Ling!

383
00:25:42,365 --> 00:25:44,245
Where are you going?
We need to get a photo.

384
00:25:44,725 --> 00:25:47,005
I've already had my photo taken.
I don't need one with you.

385
00:25:52,645 --> 00:25:53,685
What is it, An Ran?

386
00:25:54,405 --> 00:25:57,325
I'm a bit dizzy from the sun.

387
00:25:57,405 --> 00:26:00,365
Yizhou, could you give me a ride home?

388
00:26:02,725 --> 00:26:03,965
Are you worried about Xia Lin?

389
00:26:04,045 --> 00:26:06,645
Don't worry, Chu Yan will drive her home.

390
00:26:08,045 --> 00:26:09,285
Alright, let's go.

391
00:26:10,965 --> 00:26:13,245
You want me to drive you home? Fat chance!

392
00:26:14,285 --> 00:26:16,005
What are you still doing here? Come on.

393
00:26:17,485 --> 00:26:18,325
The event is over?

394
00:26:18,805 --> 00:26:20,845
Yeah. Could you give us a ride?

395
00:26:20,925 --> 00:26:21,885
Get in then.

396
00:26:21,965 --> 00:26:22,925
An Ran.

397
00:26:23,445 --> 00:26:25,885
Maybe you've been abroad
for so long that you've forgotten.

398
00:26:26,325 --> 00:26:28,925
Only a wife or girlfriend
can ride shotgun.

399
00:26:29,005 --> 00:26:31,045
No other woman is allowed in that seat.

400
00:26:32,445 --> 00:26:33,645
I've never heard that before.

401
00:26:33,725 --> 00:26:34,885
Now you have.

402
00:26:37,045 --> 00:26:38,725
Do you two want to walk home?

403
00:26:38,805 --> 00:26:39,645
I'm riding shotgun!

404
00:26:45,525 --> 00:26:47,645
An Ran, are you feeling better?

405
00:26:48,245 --> 00:26:49,645
I am. I just needed to rest.

406
00:26:50,125 --> 00:26:52,805
Otherwise, I wouldn't come bother
you guys for a free dinner.

407
00:26:53,845 --> 00:26:56,565
Little princess, you're out of shape.

408
00:26:56,645 --> 00:26:57,805
Look at me.

409
00:26:57,885 --> 00:27:00,245
I jogged the whole afternoon
and I'm feeling fine.

410
00:27:01,125 --> 00:27:02,165
You call that jogging?

411
00:27:02,245 --> 00:27:03,325
I walk faster than you.

412
00:27:04,485 --> 00:27:07,045
What's your problem?
You can't even shut up while we're eating?

413
00:27:07,845 --> 00:27:08,685
Here.

414
00:27:09,445 --> 00:27:11,565
You'll choke on all that rice.

415
00:27:11,645 --> 00:27:13,685
I like to eat rice plain, OK?

416
00:27:13,765 --> 00:27:14,685
Idiot.

417
00:27:19,165 --> 00:27:20,365
An Ran, have a shrimp.

418
00:27:21,285 --> 00:27:22,245
Yizhou...

419
00:27:22,765 --> 00:27:25,285
Chu Yan is right.
You're too frail, you should eat more.

420
00:27:28,925 --> 00:27:31,045
You ran so hard today,
have some more food.

421
00:27:33,085 --> 00:27:34,405
<i>Don't forget you're married.</i>

422
00:27:35,445 --> 00:27:36,725
<i>What a joke.</i>

423
00:27:36,805 --> 00:27:38,805
<i>-What are you going to do then?</i>
<i>-Don't provoke me.</i>

424
00:27:39,405 --> 00:27:41,325
<i>Bring it on. I'm not afraid of you.</i>

425
00:27:58,005 --> 00:28:00,085
This is delicious. Have some more.

426
00:28:01,325 --> 00:28:03,125
Here, An Ran, you can't reach this dish.

427
00:28:03,205 --> 00:28:04,645
Here you go.

428
00:28:06,125 --> 00:28:07,245
Don't you love this meat?

429
00:28:07,325 --> 00:28:08,445
Have another shrimp.

430
00:28:08,885 --> 00:28:10,685
And this tastes amazing.

431
00:28:15,085 --> 00:28:16,445
Here, have some more.

432
00:28:25,805 --> 00:28:27,005
Stop! Enough!

433
00:28:27,485 --> 00:28:28,885
My plate is full!

434
00:28:29,405 --> 00:28:31,765
You can start competing
after I finish what's on my plate.

435
00:28:32,805 --> 00:28:35,405
Yizhou, I can't eat this much.

436
00:28:35,725 --> 00:28:36,805
Just leave it then.

437
00:28:38,205 --> 00:28:41,005
What a waste. I haven't even touched it.

438
00:28:41,085 --> 00:28:42,085
Let's split it.

439
00:28:42,165 --> 00:28:43,005
Sure.

440
00:28:50,605 --> 00:28:51,725
Xia Lin, that's my juice!

441
00:28:53,285 --> 00:28:55,245
It's just juice. Are you that stingy?

442
00:28:55,325 --> 00:28:56,525
Have mine.

443
00:29:01,325 --> 00:29:04,045
Yizhou, you hate chili peppers!
You should be careful.

444
00:29:04,125 --> 00:29:05,445
You've had them before.

445
00:29:07,485 --> 00:29:09,365
They're not as spicy as I remember.

446
00:29:09,885 --> 00:29:10,725
Is that so?

447
00:29:12,525 --> 00:29:15,685
You've gotten better
at eating spicy food, Ling!

448
00:29:16,205 --> 00:29:17,845
Thanks to Xia Lin.

449
00:29:18,805 --> 00:29:19,685
Oh, really?

450
00:29:24,805 --> 00:29:25,885
<i>You have no idea.</i>

451
00:29:25,965 --> 00:29:28,285
<i>She scratched herself peeling two shrimps.</i>

452
00:29:28,645 --> 00:29:30,365
<i>Then he gave her a ride home.</i>

453
00:29:30,445 --> 00:29:32,365
<i>She invited him in for tea!</i>

454
00:29:32,445 --> 00:29:33,645
<i>Right in front of me!</i>

455
00:29:34,245 --> 00:29:36,285
You said there's nothing wrong
with liking someone.

456
00:29:37,525 --> 00:29:39,965
I was young and naive back then.

457
00:29:40,805 --> 00:29:43,365
Why is she being so flirty
when she knows he has a wife?

458
00:29:44,045 --> 00:29:46,645
I don't care if they grew up together,
or if they're royalty.

459
00:29:48,405 --> 00:29:51,125
She invited Ling Yizhou
to the Celebrity Jog with her.

460
00:29:51,205 --> 00:29:52,765
I knew she was up to no good.

461
00:29:53,925 --> 00:29:57,405
If reporters got a photo,
it would make the headlines again.

462
00:29:58,045 --> 00:30:00,445
Wen Li took care of that beforehand.

463
00:30:00,525 --> 00:30:01,685
You should thank him for me.

464
00:30:04,205 --> 00:30:06,365
Any progress with Mr. Ling?

465
00:30:07,005 --> 00:30:10,245
All of Chu Yan's ideas sucked.

466
00:30:10,845 --> 00:30:14,645
<i>Those strategies of yours</i>
<i>aren't direct enough.</i>

467
00:30:14,965 --> 00:30:17,405
<i>Men are visual animals.</i>

468
00:30:17,685 --> 00:30:20,045
Just go straight for it. Pounce on him!

469
00:30:20,565 --> 00:30:23,005
Think about it. Once you eat him up,

470
00:30:23,605 --> 00:30:25,525
you'll be getting kisses from him again.

471
00:30:25,605 --> 00:30:27,605
Your mind is always in the gutter, Fei.

472
00:30:29,885 --> 00:30:31,445
Wen Li just got home.

473
00:30:31,525 --> 00:30:34,285
Let's stop here, or else he'll be sad
if he hears about you guys.

474
00:30:34,805 --> 00:30:36,925
Remember what I said. Go for it!

475
00:30:37,685 --> 00:30:38,805
<i>Bye now!</i>

476
00:30:42,965 --> 00:30:46,805
Why is my marriage so tragic?

477
00:30:52,525 --> 00:30:54,965
I told you so many times.
Put your snacks away.

478
00:31:00,325 --> 00:31:01,485
Why aren't you wearing...

479
00:31:04,485 --> 00:31:06,645
I just took a shower. It's hot.

480
00:31:08,285 --> 00:31:10,085
By the way, Linlin wanted me to thank you.

481
00:31:10,165 --> 00:31:12,845
She said you kept things
under a tight wrap today.

482
00:31:12,925 --> 00:31:15,525
Let's go eat something yummy tonight.
I really want to get--

483
00:31:21,045 --> 00:31:22,685
Strange.

484
00:32:18,685 --> 00:32:19,645
Don't come into my room.

485
00:32:20,245 --> 00:32:21,165
Get out.

486
00:32:21,805 --> 00:32:23,205
-Out.
-Why?

487
00:32:23,885 --> 00:32:24,725
Get out.

488
00:32:27,525 --> 00:32:28,765
What are you doing?

489
00:32:32,885 --> 00:32:34,165
Are you crazy?

490
00:32:40,205 --> 00:32:42,045
What a stupid jerk.

491
00:32:42,885 --> 00:32:44,405
You'd better not come looking for me.

492
00:32:50,085 --> 00:32:51,245
Xia Lin?

493
00:32:53,725 --> 00:32:55,725
Sorry, I know it's late.

494
00:32:56,605 --> 00:33:00,085
Could I borrow your phone?

495
00:33:01,005 --> 00:33:02,085
Of course. Come in.

496
00:33:14,925 --> 00:33:15,765
Put this on.

497
00:33:16,125 --> 00:33:16,965
Thank you.

498
00:33:25,325 --> 00:33:26,485
Here's some hot water.

499
00:33:28,565 --> 00:33:29,645
Why are you wearing that?

500
00:33:31,565 --> 00:33:35,045
I got into a fight at home.
So I ran out without thinking.

501
00:33:35,645 --> 00:33:37,645
You didn't bring anything.
So you came here?

502
00:33:38,245 --> 00:33:40,805
Well, among my friends,
you live the nearest.

503
00:33:45,885 --> 00:33:46,885
Friend?

504
00:33:53,525 --> 00:33:54,725
I feel better now.

505
00:33:55,485 --> 00:33:58,485
Could I make a call with your phone?

506
00:33:59,365 --> 00:34:00,845
I'll have a friend come and get me.

507
00:34:01,325 --> 00:34:02,245
Of course.

508
00:34:02,885 --> 00:34:05,605
You can tell me all about it
if you want to.

509
00:34:06,085 --> 00:34:08,765
Really? You won't be annoyed?

510
00:34:09,125 --> 00:34:11,125
Didn't you just say we're friends?

511
00:34:15,244 --> 00:34:17,405
You're fighting with your boyfriend?

512
00:34:19,365 --> 00:34:21,765
Not my boyfriend, my husband.

513
00:34:22,285 --> 00:34:24,125
Didn't I tell you before

514
00:34:24,204 --> 00:34:27,285
that my friend's husband
lost his memory in a car crash?

515
00:34:27,365 --> 00:34:30,805
That friend was actually me.

516
00:34:32,885 --> 00:34:34,204
I guessed so.

517
00:34:35,285 --> 00:34:38,244
Yeah, you do seem smart.

518
00:34:40,525 --> 00:34:41,885
In this world,

519
00:34:41,965 --> 00:34:43,684
there are three things you can never hide.

520
00:34:44,045 --> 00:34:46,405
A cough, poverty, and love.

521
00:34:46,965 --> 00:34:49,845
But love is between two people.

522
00:34:50,644 --> 00:34:52,845
It's unrequited if it's just one person.

523
00:34:54,164 --> 00:34:55,644
I understand that now.

524
00:34:56,285 --> 00:34:59,085
Unrequited love is so awkward.

525
00:35:01,684 --> 00:35:03,285
Do you know what you need right now?

526
00:35:04,765 --> 00:35:05,605
What?

527
00:35:06,285 --> 00:35:07,125
Some alcohol.

528
00:35:24,605 --> 00:35:26,085
Did Mrs. Ling call you today?

529
00:35:26,405 --> 00:35:27,445
Nope.

530
00:35:27,845 --> 00:35:28,885
Sir, she didn't call.

531
00:35:30,605 --> 00:35:32,565
What's going on?

532
00:35:33,365 --> 00:35:35,045
Mr. Ling was having a video conference.

533
00:35:35,325 --> 00:35:36,725
Mrs. Ling went in wearing lingerie.

534
00:35:37,845 --> 00:35:40,165
So Mr. Ling yelled at her?

535
00:35:40,685 --> 00:35:43,165
That's what they're saying
in our company group chat.

536
00:35:45,165 --> 00:35:46,525
I gave her terrible advice.

537
00:35:47,005 --> 00:35:48,165
Where is she now?

538
00:35:48,565 --> 00:35:49,405
I don't know.

539
00:36:04,365 --> 00:36:06,645
I'm sorry. I fell asleep.

540
00:36:06,725 --> 00:36:07,685
What time is it?

541
00:36:08,085 --> 00:36:08,925
Half past midnight.

542
00:36:10,525 --> 00:36:12,765
What? Oh, my god.

543
00:36:12,845 --> 00:36:13,765
Nan, I have to go.

544
00:36:13,845 --> 00:36:14,805
Get some rest.

545
00:36:14,885 --> 00:36:16,885
-Let me drive you.
-No, I can get myself back.

546
00:36:17,245 --> 00:36:18,085
Xia Lin.

547
00:36:18,805 --> 00:36:21,165
Two people should only be together
if it makes them happier.

548
00:36:21,965 --> 00:36:23,445
If you're not happy,

549
00:36:23,525 --> 00:36:24,845
it might be better to let it go.

550
00:36:25,805 --> 00:36:26,685
You don't understand.

551
00:36:26,765 --> 00:36:28,525
He's not just my legal husband.

552
00:36:28,605 --> 00:36:29,725
He saved my life.

553
00:36:31,285 --> 00:36:32,205
He saved your life?

554
00:36:32,885 --> 00:36:34,645
Yes. I was very ill before.

555
00:36:35,005 --> 00:36:37,885
I can't really explain it all right now.
I'll tell you next time, goodbye!

556
00:36:39,085 --> 00:36:40,365
Here you go.

557
00:37:33,965 --> 00:37:34,925
<i>That's mine.</i>

558
00:37:35,005 --> 00:37:35,885
<i>I know.</i>

559
00:37:36,325 --> 00:37:37,605
<i>I just wanted to drink yours.</i>

560
00:37:38,165 --> 00:37:39,165
<i>I'm your husband.</i>

561
00:37:40,005 --> 00:37:41,725
<i>Why not just ask me for help?</i>

562
00:37:43,165 --> 00:37:45,685
-Nobody knows we're married.
-I do.

563
00:37:50,725 --> 00:37:51,765
TRANSFER OF PROPERTY

564
00:37:51,845 --> 00:37:52,925
We're married.

565
00:37:53,405 --> 00:37:54,925
What's mine is also yours.

566
00:37:59,085 --> 00:38:00,765
Pinky promise.

567
00:38:06,325 --> 00:38:08,565
This is my first time drunk.
I'll be careful next time.

568
00:38:08,925 --> 00:38:11,845
There won't be a next time.
No drinking anymore.

569
00:38:20,765 --> 00:38:21,925
You're back?

570
00:38:45,205 --> 00:38:46,045
You're drunk.

571
00:38:47,445 --> 00:38:48,405
It's not your alcohol.

572
00:38:49,685 --> 00:38:51,045
I'm tired. I'm going to bed.

573
00:38:54,845 --> 00:38:57,205
Leaving without a word.
Coming home late drunk.

574
00:38:57,645 --> 00:38:58,965
Is this how Mrs. Ling behaves?

575
00:38:59,045 --> 00:39:01,325
Mrs. Ling has been abandoned. Who cares?

576
00:39:02,685 --> 00:39:04,765
Let me know
when you've found the next Mrs. Ling.

577
00:39:05,245 --> 00:39:06,285
I'll clear out my stuff.

578
00:39:07,285 --> 00:39:09,685
I thought you were an actress.

579
00:39:10,205 --> 00:39:12,165
You're done after
just a few days of acting?

580
00:39:12,845 --> 00:39:14,125
So what if I'm an actress?

581
00:39:14,205 --> 00:39:16,925
No matter how good I am,
I can't melt your heart of stone.

582
00:39:17,005 --> 00:39:18,885
You're as stubborn as a mule.
You'll never budge.

583
00:39:20,725 --> 00:39:21,565
Do you feel hurt?

584
00:39:22,445 --> 00:39:23,845
Of course I feel hurt!

585
00:39:23,925 --> 00:39:26,045
You used to defend me
in front of your friends.

586
00:39:26,125 --> 00:39:27,645
You used to call me your wife.

587
00:39:28,165 --> 00:39:30,085
She isn't my friend. She's my wife.

588
00:39:30,805 --> 00:39:32,605
I don't care what kind of person she was.

589
00:39:33,085 --> 00:39:34,445
She's mine now.

590
00:39:35,085 --> 00:39:38,125
You're the only one in the world
who can bother me, besides my grandma.

591
00:39:38,525 --> 00:39:40,205
Even though you're a picky eater,

592
00:39:40,285 --> 00:39:42,085
you'd eat what I like to eat.

593
00:39:42,685 --> 00:39:44,405
You never celebrated your birthday.

594
00:39:44,485 --> 00:39:45,925
But you changed for me.

595
00:39:46,805 --> 00:39:48,845
You did so many things
that touched my heart.

596
00:39:49,525 --> 00:39:51,405
And now you're taking it all back.

597
00:39:53,565 --> 00:39:56,205
You can't accept the current situation,
so I have to deal with it.

598
00:39:57,045 --> 00:39:59,605
Don't you see how unfair this is?

599
00:40:22,325 --> 00:40:23,245
Stop crying.

600
00:40:49,965 --> 00:40:53,325
If you didn't visit me on set that day,

601
00:40:54,605 --> 00:40:56,045
you wouldn't have had the accident.

602
00:40:57,285 --> 00:40:58,485
In the end...

603
00:40:59,765 --> 00:41:01,525
I'm the one who hurt you.

604
00:41:08,165 --> 00:41:10,645
It was just an accident.

605
00:41:12,285 --> 00:41:13,805
I don't hate you that much.

606
00:41:16,965 --> 00:41:20,725
Are you starting to like me?

607
00:41:30,885 --> 00:41:32,125
DRIVING TO MEET MY FAIRY

608
00:41:32,525 --> 00:41:34,005
They're running faster than this car.

609
00:41:34,085 --> 00:41:35,605
Can you speed up?

610
00:41:35,925 --> 00:41:38,005
I am stepping on it. Calm down.

611
00:41:42,325 --> 00:41:44,205
I GOT A BURN FROM COOKING,
BUT NOBODY NOTICED

612
00:41:46,405 --> 00:41:48,045
-Are you OK?
-No.

613
00:41:48,125 --> 00:41:49,205
It's hot.

614
00:41:55,325 --> 00:41:56,165
Mr. Ling.

615
00:41:57,205 --> 00:42:00,045
Would you like PR
to manage your Weibo account?

616
00:42:00,525 --> 00:42:03,325
No. She can play with it.

617
00:42:04,085 --> 00:42:04,925
Yes, sir.

618
00:42:06,405 --> 00:42:08,685
Buy me a hundred KuGou smart speakers.

619
00:42:09,285 --> 00:42:11,245
A gift for your Mrs. Ling?

620
00:42:11,805 --> 00:42:13,125
Could I have one, too?

621
00:42:13,405 --> 00:42:15,805
I heard those smart speakers
have touch panels.

622
00:42:16,805 --> 00:42:18,525
You can listen to anything with them.

623
00:42:19,965 --> 00:42:20,885
Is this your business?

624
00:42:22,565 --> 00:42:24,925
-How about I give you all of them?
-No, thank you.

625
00:44:01,245 --> 00:44:03,005
Subtitle translation by Jake Eberts

626
00:44:03,085 --> 00:44:04,125
This is my house.

627
00:44:04,205 --> 00:44:05,965
I don't want to see you here every day.

628
00:44:06,605 --> 00:44:09,005
I don't want you alone with my husband.

629
00:44:09,365 --> 00:44:11,325
I just want to help you take care of him.

630
00:44:11,405 --> 00:44:12,245
Are you done?

631
00:44:12,325 --> 00:44:13,805
Get out. Close the door for me.

632
00:44:14,165 --> 00:44:16,725
He wasn't super affectionate before,

633
00:44:17,125 --> 00:44:19,485
but at least he wasn't this mean.

634
00:44:20,085 --> 00:44:22,245
This is the normal Ling Yizhou.

635
00:44:22,805 --> 00:44:26,245
The doting Ling Yizhou was abnormal.

636
00:44:26,325 --> 00:44:27,525
You want to use me
