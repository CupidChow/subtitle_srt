1
00:00:12,965 --> 00:00:14,685
So, the real reason
<i>Frosty Moon</i> was cancelled

2
00:00:14,765 --> 00:00:15,925
and Lu Di was blacklisted

3
00:00:16,645 --> 00:00:17,645
is all because of you?

4
00:00:18,325 --> 00:00:19,245
He was blacklisted?

5
00:00:19,965 --> 00:00:21,205
I didn't know about that.

6
00:00:21,645 --> 00:00:23,925
He hit on my woman.
Of course he had to pay.

7
00:00:24,685 --> 00:00:27,685
Besides this, is there anything else
you're hiding from me?

8
00:00:28,525 --> 00:00:29,365
Nope.

9
00:00:30,245 --> 00:00:33,885
If reporters get a photo of us,
we'll be in the gossip column again.

10
00:00:34,485 --> 00:00:35,605
I saw Chu Yan

11
00:00:36,205 --> 00:00:39,245
and your girlfriend walk
into a hotel room.

12
00:00:42,845 --> 00:00:46,645
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

13
00:02:13,484 --> 00:02:16,445
EPISODE 11

14
00:02:17,965 --> 00:02:20,285
Director Ling,
your wife had quite a shock.

15
00:02:20,645 --> 00:02:23,245
She fainted because of her anemia.

16
00:02:25,165 --> 00:02:27,445
But her anemia
hasn't occurred for a while.

17
00:02:28,845 --> 00:02:30,965
It could be due to stress,

18
00:02:31,365 --> 00:02:34,085
so she must get a lot of rest.

19
00:02:35,725 --> 00:02:36,565
Thank you.

20
00:03:00,325 --> 00:03:01,165
Mumu.

21
00:03:03,485 --> 00:03:04,965
What should I do?

22
00:04:00,765 --> 00:04:01,765
Good morning, Mrs. Ling.

23
00:04:02,605 --> 00:04:03,445
Where is Ling Yizhou?

24
00:04:03,725 --> 00:04:06,005
Mr. Ling has already left for work.

25
00:04:06,085 --> 00:04:07,725
He wants you to get some rest.

26
00:04:08,925 --> 00:04:12,485
Mrs. Ling, did you two have a fight?

27
00:04:12,845 --> 00:04:15,045
No, we didn't. Ms. Huang, I'm heading out.

28
00:04:15,125 --> 00:04:18,125
-But, Mrs. Ling, there's...
-There's what?

29
00:04:24,565 --> 00:04:27,805
Our company revenue this quarter has
increased by 3% compared to last quarter,

30
00:04:28,125 --> 00:04:30,365
with 62% coming from real estate.

31
00:04:30,725 --> 00:04:33,765
As for electronic products,
net profit has decreased slightly.

32
00:04:33,845 --> 00:04:37,125
After a series of adjustments,
we have minimized its impact.

33
00:04:45,805 --> 00:04:47,565
Mr. Ling, your phone is ringing.

34
00:04:54,325 --> 00:04:55,285
Hello?

35
00:04:55,365 --> 00:04:57,085
<i>Ling Yizhou,</i>
<i>you are detaining me illegally!</i>

36
00:05:06,005 --> 00:05:06,845
Mumu.

37
00:05:07,725 --> 00:05:09,725
Let's talk when I get home. Get some rest.

38
00:05:10,125 --> 00:05:11,645
You have no right to confine me.

39
00:05:12,125 --> 00:05:14,645
If you don't want to see me,
I can stay at a hotel.

40
00:05:14,725 --> 00:05:15,965
I want to leave this house!

41
00:05:16,405 --> 00:05:17,605
Immediately! Now!

42
00:05:18,045 --> 00:05:18,885
<i>Not right now.</i>

43
00:05:28,045 --> 00:05:29,285
<i>What just happened?</i>

44
00:05:29,645 --> 00:05:32,765
<i>Could it be our almighty future Mrs. Ling?</i>

45
00:05:33,005 --> 00:05:36,205
<i>We're screwed. They must be fighting.</i>
<i>Boss seems to be in a bad mood today.</i>

46
00:05:37,205 --> 00:05:39,725
<i>What can we do to prevent further harm?</i>

47
00:05:40,485 --> 00:05:43,005
<i>We'll be on orange alert</i>
<i>until further notice.</i>

48
00:05:55,045 --> 00:05:56,485
Turn off your phones during meetings.

49
00:05:57,085 --> 00:05:59,445
Five points will be deducted
from your performance assessment.

50
00:05:59,525 --> 00:06:00,685
No leave for three months.

51
00:06:01,125 --> 00:06:01,965
Noted.

52
00:06:02,485 --> 00:06:03,325
Meeting dismissed.

53
00:06:07,285 --> 00:06:09,365
Mrs. Ling, what are you doing?

54
00:06:09,845 --> 00:06:12,565
Mr. Ling just wants you
to get some rest at home.

55
00:06:13,005 --> 00:06:14,845
That doesn't mean he can lock me up.

56
00:06:18,605 --> 00:06:21,565
Where is my marriage certificate?
I'm sure I left it here.

57
00:06:22,805 --> 00:06:24,485
He must have taken it with him.

58
00:06:25,645 --> 00:06:28,245
Mrs. Ling, why are you looking
for your marriage certificate?

59
00:06:28,685 --> 00:06:30,645
Do you know where he keeps his documents?

60
00:06:32,165 --> 00:06:33,165
Mrs. Ling,

61
00:06:33,245 --> 00:06:35,965
why don't you have breakfast first?

62
00:07:01,005 --> 00:07:03,085
You think you can
keep me locked up forever?

63
00:07:04,525 --> 00:07:05,565
We'll see about that.

64
00:07:24,685 --> 00:07:27,285
Ms. Huang.

65
00:07:28,285 --> 00:07:29,885
What is it, Mrs. Ling?

66
00:07:30,525 --> 00:07:32,645
I think I'm not feeling well.

67
00:07:34,485 --> 00:07:35,685
101.7 degrees Fahrenheit?

68
00:07:36,445 --> 00:07:39,365
Mrs. Ling,
why do you suddenly have a fever?

69
00:07:39,805 --> 00:07:41,485
Ms. Huang, I feel terrible.

70
00:07:42,245 --> 00:07:43,805
Can you take me to the hospital?

71
00:07:44,245 --> 00:07:45,445
But, Mr. Ling said...

72
00:07:45,685 --> 00:07:48,325
What if I die here? Would he like that?

73
00:07:50,045 --> 00:07:51,165
-But he said--
-Ms. Huang.

74
00:07:51,525 --> 00:07:52,525
Sir.

75
00:07:52,885 --> 00:07:54,365
Call Dr. Wang and have him come.

76
00:07:54,445 --> 00:07:55,405
Yes, sir.

77
00:07:56,965 --> 00:07:58,005
No need for that.

78
00:07:58,285 --> 00:07:59,125
Mumu...

79
00:08:00,245 --> 00:08:01,845
Why do you want our marriage certificate?

80
00:08:01,925 --> 00:08:03,565
Besides buying a house
and having children,

81
00:08:04,005 --> 00:08:05,605
what else can I do with it?

82
00:08:06,525 --> 00:08:07,965
I was wrong. Can you forgive me?

83
00:08:08,445 --> 00:08:09,765
It's not about right or wrong.

84
00:08:10,165 --> 00:08:12,525
Ling Yizhou, you love being in control.

85
00:08:12,605 --> 00:08:14,205
Even in love, you try to set people up.

86
00:08:14,565 --> 00:08:16,005
I was just trying to protect you.

87
00:08:16,445 --> 00:08:17,845
You're being overprotective.

88
00:08:18,805 --> 00:08:20,325
I can barely breathe.

89
00:08:22,565 --> 00:08:23,845
What do you want me to do?

90
00:08:26,645 --> 00:08:27,845
Get rid of the two guards.

91
00:08:28,365 --> 00:08:29,565
Or else I'll call the police.

92
00:08:31,165 --> 00:08:33,685
Mumu. I won't let you leave me.

93
00:08:33,765 --> 00:08:35,725
Let go of me.

94
00:08:36,165 --> 00:08:39,005
Let go!

95
00:08:42,845 --> 00:08:43,765
Never.

96
00:09:33,525 --> 00:09:35,805
Hello? How can I help you, Mrs. Ling?

97
00:09:36,365 --> 00:09:38,245
Can you pick me up at the Ling residence?

98
00:09:38,645 --> 00:09:39,485
Right now?

99
00:09:40,885 --> 00:09:42,805
Did you have a fight with Ling?

100
00:09:43,965 --> 00:09:45,365
Are you coming or not?

101
00:09:47,685 --> 00:09:49,205
You really had a fight with Ling?

102
00:09:50,485 --> 00:09:52,445
<i>That's rare! It's late.</i>

103
00:09:52,525 --> 00:09:54,245
Can you cut me some slack?

104
00:09:54,565 --> 00:09:56,325
I have an early flight to catch tomorrow.

105
00:09:58,165 --> 00:09:59,485
Fine. Go rest.

106
00:10:00,965 --> 00:10:02,245
Hello? Are you OK?

107
00:10:03,765 --> 00:10:04,605
Hello?

108
00:10:17,045 --> 00:10:19,765
Sir, Mrs. Ling hasn't eaten
anything today.

109
00:10:21,245 --> 00:10:22,085
Got it.

110
00:10:33,885 --> 00:10:36,285
It's day one of my hunger strike
and I'm already starving.

111
00:10:36,565 --> 00:10:38,005
What am I going to do tomorrow?

112
00:10:47,005 --> 00:10:48,005
Mumu.

113
00:10:49,165 --> 00:10:50,845
Ms. Huang told me you have no appetite.

114
00:10:51,365 --> 00:10:52,325
Why aren't you eating?

115
00:10:52,805 --> 00:10:54,525
There's nothing wrong with my appetite.

116
00:10:54,605 --> 00:10:56,445
I'll starve myself
if you don't let me out.

117
00:10:56,925 --> 00:10:59,605
You can be mad at me,
but don't mess with your health.

118
00:10:59,685 --> 00:11:00,725
Go eat something.

119
00:11:01,485 --> 00:11:03,645
Ling Yizhou, I'm not your pet.

120
00:11:03,725 --> 00:11:05,445
I can survive
without you taking care of me.

121
00:11:06,605 --> 00:11:08,205
I won't let you go.

122
00:11:08,725 --> 00:11:10,765
I don't want anything. Just my freedom.

123
00:11:11,285 --> 00:11:12,925
If there's nothing else, then get out.

124
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:14,085
Come with me.

125
00:11:14,485 --> 00:11:15,525
Let go of me.

126
00:11:15,605 --> 00:11:17,165
What are you doing? Let me go!

127
00:11:18,525 --> 00:11:19,365
Let go.

128
00:11:19,685 --> 00:11:21,565
Let go of me.
What do you think you're doing?

129
00:11:21,845 --> 00:11:23,485
Ms. Huang, warm up the food.

130
00:11:24,205 --> 00:11:25,325
What are you doing?

131
00:11:27,445 --> 00:11:28,645
Mumu, you must eat something.

132
00:11:29,645 --> 00:11:30,485
I won't.

133
00:11:30,965 --> 00:11:33,125
Don't damage your health
just because you're mad at me.

134
00:11:35,485 --> 00:11:37,565
Fine, I'll eat.

135
00:11:37,645 --> 00:11:39,085
-Under one condition.
-Say it.

136
00:11:39,485 --> 00:11:40,525
I don't want to see you.

137
00:11:40,605 --> 00:11:42,285
Fine, I'll go stay at a hotel tomorrow.

138
00:11:42,805 --> 00:11:44,765
-I'll come back when you feel better.
-Leave now.

139
00:11:49,005 --> 00:11:51,205
OK. I'll go back to my room.

140
00:12:02,165 --> 00:12:03,405
You need to come over right now.

141
00:12:03,965 --> 00:12:05,605
The two of them are fighting.

142
00:12:34,925 --> 00:12:37,605
Help! Director Ling's door is locked.
It can't be opened.

143
00:12:38,005 --> 00:12:41,125
Hurry! Some help, please.

144
00:12:43,565 --> 00:12:44,405
Mumu, open the door.

145
00:12:45,645 --> 00:12:46,525
Is anyone here?

146
00:12:47,685 --> 00:12:50,045
-What's going on, Mrs. Ling?
-The door lock is broken. Look.

147
00:12:51,445 --> 00:12:52,325
Is someone out there?

148
00:12:53,485 --> 00:12:54,605
Unlock my door at once.

149
00:12:54,965 --> 00:12:56,605
Hold on, sir. I'll go get Ms. Huang.

150
00:12:57,205 --> 00:12:59,445
-Ms. Huang, bring us the spare key. Hurry!
-Mumu.

151
00:13:00,325 --> 00:13:02,005
Coming!

152
00:13:02,085 --> 00:13:03,165
Mumu, unlock the door.

153
00:13:12,405 --> 00:13:13,445
What's going on?

154
00:13:13,525 --> 00:13:15,205
-Hurry up!
-The door's locked?

155
00:13:17,285 --> 00:13:18,445
-Where is she?
-Downstairs.

156
00:13:21,045 --> 00:13:22,165
Mumu!

157
00:13:23,205 --> 00:13:24,085
Stop right there.

158
00:13:25,565 --> 00:13:26,765
Grandma, why are you here?

159
00:13:26,845 --> 00:13:28,565
If Ms. Huang didn't call me,

160
00:13:28,965 --> 00:13:31,445
I wouldn't have known
that the house is in chaos.

161
00:13:32,365 --> 00:13:34,525
Can't you sit down and talk it out?

162
00:13:35,045 --> 00:13:36,445
Mumu, are you alright?

163
00:13:40,525 --> 00:13:41,365
Mumu.

164
00:13:41,925 --> 00:13:44,645
Did he bully you?

165
00:13:45,405 --> 00:13:47,165
You can tell me.

166
00:13:47,685 --> 00:13:49,125
I'll make things right.

167
00:13:58,005 --> 00:14:02,525
Mumu, Grandma told me you only
brought up divorce in a moment of anger.

168
00:14:03,725 --> 00:14:05,485
You just want to be left alone.
Is that true?

169
00:14:06,965 --> 00:14:09,005
Does it matter if it's true or not now?

170
00:14:12,005 --> 00:14:13,805
I was wrong. Please don't leave me.

171
00:14:14,725 --> 00:14:15,645
You were wrong?

172
00:14:17,405 --> 00:14:19,085
Do you really know what you did wrong?

173
00:14:20,845 --> 00:14:24,165
If you knew,
you wouldn't have locked me up.

174
00:14:24,445 --> 00:14:26,845
I never thought
about getting a divorce at first.

175
00:14:26,925 --> 00:14:29,205
I just wanted some time
to think about our relationship.

176
00:14:29,565 --> 00:14:31,325
I never thought you would lock me up.

177
00:14:32,125 --> 00:14:35,085
You've never treated me
as an independent individual.

178
00:14:35,165 --> 00:14:37,845
You just want to satisfy your sense
of possession and manipulation.

179
00:14:42,925 --> 00:14:43,765
Mumu.

180
00:14:45,285 --> 00:14:48,845
Didn't you want to know
about the first time we met?

181
00:14:51,565 --> 00:14:55,925
It was two years ago on our birthday.

182
00:15:07,925 --> 00:15:08,965
Welcome, sir.

183
00:15:09,525 --> 00:15:11,565
-I would like a birthday cake.
-No problem, sir.

184
00:15:11,645 --> 00:15:14,725
You get a "buy one, get one free" discount
with your membership.

185
00:15:14,805 --> 00:15:15,725
I'll pass.

186
00:15:17,445 --> 00:15:18,485
Sorry, sir.

187
00:15:18,565 --> 00:15:20,965
Our card machine is broken.
We can't accept card payments.

188
00:15:23,085 --> 00:15:23,925
Then forget about it.

189
00:15:24,165 --> 00:15:25,005
Sorry about that.

190
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:27,085
Use my membership card then.

191
00:15:27,485 --> 00:15:28,765
Today is my birthday, too.

192
00:15:28,845 --> 00:15:30,405
I can buy one and get one free.

193
00:15:30,485 --> 00:15:32,245
Just count it as my treat.

194
00:15:33,445 --> 00:15:34,285
OK, thank you.

195
00:15:34,365 --> 00:15:36,165
No worries.
I can't eat that much cake anyway.

196
00:15:36,685 --> 00:15:39,605
I'll give the other one to you.
Happy Birthday.

197
00:15:43,245 --> 00:15:44,565
Two cakes, please.

198
00:15:44,645 --> 00:15:45,645
No problem.

199
00:15:52,325 --> 00:15:53,965
XIA LIN

200
00:15:54,445 --> 00:15:55,605
So your name is Xia Lin.

201
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:07,845
So the store you took me to

202
00:16:08,605 --> 00:16:09,645
on our last birthday...

203
00:16:10,125 --> 00:16:11,845
That was where we first met.

204
00:16:13,765 --> 00:16:15,285
I don't remember it at all.

205
00:16:17,245 --> 00:16:19,205
Because that was
an unintentional act of kindness.

206
00:16:20,125 --> 00:16:22,165
Perhaps it didn't mean anything to you...

207
00:16:23,645 --> 00:16:24,845
but on that day...

208
00:16:26,605 --> 00:16:28,285
I was touched by your warm gesture.

209
00:16:30,165 --> 00:16:34,245
Just because of one cake,
you started noticing me?

210
00:16:37,845 --> 00:16:40,525
Half a year later, we met again.

211
00:16:41,725 --> 00:16:42,965
<i>My father passed away that day.</i>

212
00:16:45,325 --> 00:16:48,565
<i>I had never drunk so much.</i>

213
00:16:58,925 --> 00:17:00,045
I'm so sorry.

214
00:17:01,005 --> 00:17:03,325
She didn't do it on purpose.

215
00:17:03,405 --> 00:17:04,845
We'll pay for this drink.

216
00:17:04,925 --> 00:17:07,205
Please don't be mad at us.

217
00:17:09,124 --> 00:17:10,005
So sorry.

218
00:17:12,925 --> 00:17:13,765
Xia Lin!

219
00:17:14,324 --> 00:17:16,364
Excuse me. Sir!

220
00:17:16,765 --> 00:17:17,604
Stop!

221
00:17:18,925 --> 00:17:22,205
Sir, you bumped into me.
My phone fell into someone's drink.

222
00:17:22,645 --> 00:17:24,844
It's broken now.
You need to buy me a new phone.

223
00:17:24,925 --> 00:17:26,205
Sir, can you hear me?

224
00:17:27,485 --> 00:17:29,165
You heard me. Don't run off like this.

225
00:17:29,565 --> 00:17:31,725
My phone is dead.
You need to compensate me. You hear?

226
00:17:37,285 --> 00:17:39,925
Sir, are you OK?

227
00:17:40,885 --> 00:17:43,445
If something's troubling you,
you can talk to me about it.

228
00:17:44,005 --> 00:17:45,605
Perhaps I might be able to help.

229
00:17:47,605 --> 00:17:48,645
Hey, say something.

230
00:17:50,165 --> 00:17:51,645
What did you say? I can't hear you.

231
00:17:52,605 --> 00:17:54,485
Sir, why don't you come out of your car?

232
00:17:54,765 --> 00:17:56,645
Or at least roll down your car window.

233
00:17:57,605 --> 00:17:58,965
I can't hear what you're saying.

234
00:18:01,245 --> 00:18:02,485
Sir, what did you say?

235
00:18:04,725 --> 00:18:05,605
Where...

236
00:18:07,605 --> 00:18:08,765
Where is my steering wheel?

237
00:18:12,365 --> 00:18:13,205
What did you say?

238
00:18:15,085 --> 00:18:16,565
Where is my steering wheel?

239
00:18:18,045 --> 00:18:22,045
Sir, driving drunk
is not just irresponsible,

240
00:18:22,325 --> 00:18:24,965
you're jeopardizing the safety
of yourself and others around you.

241
00:18:25,845 --> 00:18:28,565
If you need a driver,
I can call one for you.

242
00:18:29,365 --> 00:18:30,645
Where is my steering wheel?

243
00:18:32,605 --> 00:18:33,525
Miss, I'm so sorry.

244
00:18:33,605 --> 00:18:35,885
This is my friend. I'll take care of him.

245
00:18:35,965 --> 00:18:38,405
He shouldn't risk people's lives
because he's being stupid.

246
00:18:38,725 --> 00:18:39,845
-Sorry.
-Steering wheel...

247
00:18:40,165 --> 00:18:42,685
By the way, he broke my phone.

248
00:18:42,765 --> 00:18:44,605
-You have to...
-Where's my steering wheel?

249
00:18:45,365 --> 00:18:46,205
Never mind.

250
00:18:46,925 --> 00:18:48,565
Hey! Where did my steering wheel go?

251
00:18:54,165 --> 00:18:55,725
What kind of woman is that?

252
00:18:57,645 --> 00:18:58,605
<i>After I sobered up...</i>

253
00:19:00,005 --> 00:19:03,485
<i>I remembered that</i>
<i>we met at the cake store before.</i>

254
00:19:05,005 --> 00:19:06,685
<i>The kindness you have towards strangers...</i>

255
00:19:07,925 --> 00:19:09,525
<i>was really heartwarming.</i>

256
00:19:11,885 --> 00:19:13,685
<i>I was curious about you.</i>

257
00:19:15,685 --> 00:19:20,005
<i>From that day on,</i>
<i>I'd often drop by the cake store.</i>

258
00:19:51,925 --> 00:19:53,285
<i>Every once in a while...</i>

259
00:19:54,325 --> 00:19:56,365
<i>Wen Li would update me about you.</i>

260
00:19:57,645 --> 00:19:58,925
<i>I didn't stop him.</i>

261
00:20:00,285 --> 00:20:02,245
<i>I'm not sure when it started...</i>

262
00:20:03,285 --> 00:20:05,685
<i>but I began to look forward</i>
<i>to those updates about you.</i>

263
00:20:06,325 --> 00:20:08,085
<i>I was like a drowning person.</i>

264
00:20:08,885 --> 00:20:10,565
<i>And you were like...</i>

265
00:20:11,685 --> 00:20:13,285
<i>the raft I was clinging onto to survive.</i>

266
00:20:14,325 --> 00:20:15,845
<i>I just wanted to hold you tightly.</i>

267
00:20:17,725 --> 00:20:19,565
<i>Perhaps God heard my prayers...</i>

268
00:20:20,725 --> 00:20:22,165
<i>and gave me this chance.</i>

269
00:20:22,805 --> 00:20:24,805
Ms. Xia's health report results are out.

270
00:20:25,165 --> 00:20:26,845
She just has a cold and mild anemia.

271
00:20:27,405 --> 00:20:30,285
That's why her blood test results
were abnormal. She doesn't have leukemia.

272
00:20:31,285 --> 00:20:33,405
Does she know about her results yet?

273
00:20:33,765 --> 00:20:34,645
Not yet.

274
00:20:38,285 --> 00:20:41,525
Find a way to swap her health report.

275
00:20:43,285 --> 00:20:44,125
Mumu.

276
00:20:44,965 --> 00:20:46,285
I really have...

277
00:20:47,485 --> 00:20:49,325
I've loved you for a very long time.

278
00:20:51,205 --> 00:20:54,565
If I hadn't done all that, I don't know
if you would have approached me.

279
00:20:55,125 --> 00:20:57,125
Does that justify your despicable methods?

280
00:20:58,205 --> 00:21:02,525
Did you ever think
that I'd be sad about my illness?

281
00:21:03,925 --> 00:21:05,125
I didn't think about that.

282
00:21:06,925 --> 00:21:09,525
I just wanted to seize the opportunity.

283
00:21:10,245 --> 00:21:11,085
Opportunity?

284
00:21:13,085 --> 00:21:15,085
Do you know
how devastated I was back then?

285
00:21:15,725 --> 00:21:18,565
I couldn't sleep. I kept wondering
what would happen the next day.

286
00:21:19,525 --> 00:21:22,325
If Jia Fei wasn't there for me,
I wouldn't have made it this far.

287
00:21:25,485 --> 00:21:27,725
I only did it because I love you.

288
00:21:27,805 --> 00:21:30,285
But that doesn't give you the right
to manipulate my life!

289
00:21:33,965 --> 00:21:36,925
Your love is too overwhelming
and too selfish.

290
00:21:37,005 --> 00:21:39,965
I cannot bear it. That's it.

291
00:21:42,645 --> 00:21:43,925
You signed a two-year contract.

292
00:21:44,005 --> 00:21:46,245
If you break it now,
you have to pay ten million dollars.

293
00:21:46,845 --> 00:21:48,005
I'll find a way to pay it.

294
00:21:48,845 --> 00:21:50,605
I don't mean that.
I don't want you to leave.

295
00:21:52,325 --> 00:21:54,405
When I think about how you would

296
00:21:55,005 --> 00:21:56,405
control my life if I stayed...

297
00:21:57,005 --> 00:21:59,565
Piling more restrictions and rules
on me... I feel terrified.

298
00:22:02,165 --> 00:22:03,445
If there's nothing else...

299
00:22:04,485 --> 00:22:05,485
goodbye.

300
00:22:05,565 --> 00:22:07,485
Mumu... believe me.

301
00:22:08,045 --> 00:22:10,005
I only did this
so that you could be happy.

302
00:22:10,565 --> 00:22:11,405
I...

303
00:22:13,125 --> 00:22:14,645
I really hope you can stay.

304
00:23:06,605 --> 00:23:07,645
What's going on?

305
00:23:08,005 --> 00:23:09,765
Why did you suddenly end up at a hotel?

306
00:23:14,525 --> 00:23:15,765
Did you run away from home?

307
00:23:17,285 --> 00:23:18,205
Fei...

308
00:23:19,445 --> 00:23:20,805
Can you lend me some money?

309
00:23:21,085 --> 00:23:21,925
What?

310
00:23:23,645 --> 00:23:25,085
So, you're saying that

311
00:23:25,525 --> 00:23:27,885
Mr. Ling knew about you a long time ago.

312
00:23:29,325 --> 00:23:30,725
He's crazy.

313
00:23:30,805 --> 00:23:33,445
How could he lie
about something that serious?

314
00:23:33,645 --> 00:23:35,205
Can't he just tell you he likes you?

315
00:23:36,365 --> 00:23:40,925
Maybe his brain is wired differently
than normal people.

316
00:23:42,445 --> 00:23:43,485
Wait.

317
00:23:44,005 --> 00:23:46,685
What kind of shots did they give you
when you were hospitalized?

318
00:23:47,285 --> 00:23:48,965
Those shots were for anemia.

319
00:23:49,765 --> 00:23:51,845
The drugs were all vitamins.

320
00:23:52,485 --> 00:23:55,245
I wondered why I recovered so quickly.

321
00:23:56,445 --> 00:23:59,765
I guess poverty
has limited my imagination.

322
00:24:03,805 --> 00:24:06,605
So, what's your next move? Divorce?

323
00:24:07,085 --> 00:24:11,045
I haven't thought about it.
My mind is all over the place now.

324
00:24:15,045 --> 00:24:16,765
If divorce is what you have in mind,

325
00:24:16,845 --> 00:24:19,005
don't worry, we'll find you a better guy.

326
00:24:20,045 --> 00:24:22,925
If you decide
that you don't want a divorce,

327
00:24:23,405 --> 00:24:26,725
then I'll fight Director Ling
to the bitter end with you.

328
00:24:27,245 --> 00:24:29,445
We'll make him correct his wrongdoings.

329
00:24:30,725 --> 00:24:31,805
Don't worry.

330
00:24:31,885 --> 00:24:34,165
I'll support you
no matter what you decide to do.

331
00:24:36,405 --> 00:24:38,045
Thank you, Fei.

332
00:24:38,965 --> 00:24:40,685
I still don't want to see him right now.

333
00:24:41,685 --> 00:24:44,285
My top priority
is finding a place to live.

334
00:24:45,285 --> 00:24:47,165
I did some calculations just now.

335
00:24:47,245 --> 00:24:49,205
I haven't been making much money lately.

336
00:24:49,925 --> 00:24:51,685
I don't have money
to pay for a rent deposit.

337
00:24:52,565 --> 00:24:54,725
What is there to worry about?
I have money.

338
00:24:57,205 --> 00:24:59,365
Why don't we move in together?

339
00:24:59,725 --> 00:25:02,485
Don't do that.
I'll look for a place tomorrow.

340
00:25:02,725 --> 00:25:04,365
Let's talk about it when I settle down.

341
00:25:04,445 --> 00:25:05,645
What should we do then?

342
00:25:05,965 --> 00:25:07,325
I have a script meeting tomorrow.

343
00:25:07,805 --> 00:25:09,365
It's OK. Do what you need to do.

344
00:25:09,445 --> 00:25:10,965
I'll ask Yang Tong to go with me.

345
00:25:12,685 --> 00:25:13,525
Alright.

346
00:25:14,805 --> 00:25:16,845
Let me know when you find a place.

347
00:25:16,925 --> 00:25:19,365
You remember my card PIN, right?

348
00:25:20,485 --> 00:25:23,605
Remember, don't be a cheapskate.

349
00:25:23,685 --> 00:25:26,205
Find a good place
in a good neighborhood. OK?

350
00:25:26,565 --> 00:25:27,565
OK.

351
00:25:29,005 --> 00:25:32,325
I'm worried sick about you.

352
00:25:33,885 --> 00:25:36,525
How can you be an actress when
you don't even shut the bathroom door?

353
00:26:00,445 --> 00:26:02,685
Isn't this my old place?

354
00:26:03,325 --> 00:26:04,765
The landlord was trying to sell it.

355
00:26:06,085 --> 00:26:08,085
This house has been on the market
for a long time.

356
00:26:08,525 --> 00:26:11,405
The landlord doesn't want to lose money,
so it's available for rent again.

357
00:26:11,485 --> 00:26:13,325
Fate brought you
and this place together again.

358
00:26:14,045 --> 00:26:17,205
Will the landlord be selling
the house again during my stay?

359
00:26:17,445 --> 00:26:19,405
We've signed an agreement
with the landlord.

360
00:26:19,805 --> 00:26:21,725
The penalty for early
rental termination is high.

361
00:26:22,965 --> 00:26:24,245
Excuse me. I have to take this.

362
00:26:26,325 --> 00:26:28,925
Did you get into a fight with Mr. Ling?

363
00:26:29,565 --> 00:26:30,605
No.

364
00:26:30,685 --> 00:26:31,925
Did he bully you?

365
00:26:32,005 --> 00:26:33,925
Tell me. I'll teach him a lesson.

366
00:26:35,245 --> 00:26:36,845
Haven't you always been afraid of him?

367
00:26:38,605 --> 00:26:39,885
I may be scared,

368
00:26:39,965 --> 00:26:41,565
but you're family to me.

369
00:26:42,365 --> 00:26:45,365
No matter how powerful he is,
he's not allowed to bully you.

370
00:26:46,565 --> 00:26:49,605
It's nothing.
I'm just moving out for a little while.

371
00:26:51,045 --> 00:26:53,405
Come stay with me then.

372
00:26:54,245 --> 00:26:56,845
It's OK. Your place isn't big enough
for two people.

373
00:26:57,445 --> 00:26:58,485
By the way,

374
00:26:59,325 --> 00:27:02,285
-have I got any jobs lately?
-You have.

375
00:27:03,645 --> 00:27:05,885
But they all have to do with Mr. Ling.

376
00:27:07,765 --> 00:27:10,405
In the future,
decline all jobs related to him.

377
00:27:11,565 --> 00:27:12,725
OK.

378
00:27:13,005 --> 00:27:14,485
Ms. Xia, what do you think?

379
00:27:16,165 --> 00:27:18,445
We don't need to look at any more.
I'll take it.

380
00:27:19,245 --> 00:27:21,245
-Can you settle the paperwork with him?
-Sure.

381
00:27:21,805 --> 00:27:22,645
Alright.

382
00:28:01,165 --> 00:28:02,565
-Hello?
<i>-Xia Lin.</i>

383
00:28:02,645 --> 00:28:05,245
Yang Tong told me that
you've declined a number of jobs recently.

384
00:28:05,525 --> 00:28:07,085
How come? Too busy?

385
00:28:07,645 --> 00:28:10,365
No, but I...

386
00:28:10,605 --> 00:28:13,805
Great. Could you talk to Director Ling?

387
00:28:13,885 --> 00:28:16,765
Tianyi and Lingshi could work together
and hold a collaboration event.

388
00:28:16,845 --> 00:28:18,565
Tell him not to worry
about the performers.

389
00:28:19,325 --> 00:28:21,125
<i>Chu Yan and Shuangshuang</i>
<i>will be attending.</i>

390
00:28:22,125 --> 00:28:23,085
Lisa.

391
00:28:24,085 --> 00:28:27,565
What if I were to break up
with Ling Yizhou?

392
00:28:27,925 --> 00:28:28,805
Don't you dare!

393
00:28:29,085 --> 00:28:30,565
Xia Lin, are you out of your mind?

394
00:28:30,645 --> 00:28:31,885
<i>What you should do right now</i>

395
00:28:31,965 --> 00:28:34,365
<i>is convince the media</i>
<i>that you'll soon be Mrs. Ling.</i>

396
00:28:34,445 --> 00:28:36,485
<i>It's fine that you kept it secret before,</i>

397
00:28:36,565 --> 00:28:38,885
<i>but now that it's out,</i>
<i>you should seize the opportunity.</i>

398
00:28:38,965 --> 00:28:41,005
<i>Stop declining jobs.</i>
<i>You wanted to be a star.</i>

399
00:28:41,085 --> 00:28:42,285
Alright, Lisa.

400
00:28:42,365 --> 00:28:44,285
I'm in the middle of something.
Let's talk later.

401
00:29:01,605 --> 00:29:02,845
How did you know I was here?

402
00:29:03,205 --> 00:29:04,405
Did Ling Yizhou send you here?

403
00:29:04,685 --> 00:29:05,765
Is he still spying on me?

404
00:29:06,805 --> 00:29:11,085
Please. I stayed up the whole night
to fly here. This is what I get?

405
00:29:13,125 --> 00:29:16,125
Alright. Ling Yizhou didn't send me.
It was Yang Tong.

406
00:29:17,445 --> 00:29:18,485
Tongtong?

407
00:29:20,245 --> 00:29:22,165
You moved out of the house
after that fight.

408
00:29:22,245 --> 00:29:23,245
She was worried about you.

409
00:29:24,325 --> 00:29:27,125
What happened exactly?
How did it get so serious?

410
00:29:28,925 --> 00:29:31,765
OK. If you don't want to tell me,
I'll ask Ling.

411
00:29:32,405 --> 00:29:33,805
I'll tell you in the car.

412
00:29:47,445 --> 00:29:49,125
Ling is usually quite smart,

413
00:29:49,205 --> 00:29:51,325
why does he always screw up
the important things?

414
00:29:53,205 --> 00:29:54,445
Thanks for dropping me off.

415
00:29:54,725 --> 00:29:56,725
I'm running out of time. Got to go.

416
00:29:58,405 --> 00:30:00,085
You're going to work as a promotion girl?

417
00:30:02,645 --> 00:30:04,405
I'm penniless.

418
00:30:04,965 --> 00:30:07,285
I had to borrow money from Feifei
to pay for my rent.

419
00:30:07,845 --> 00:30:10,645
All the jobs coming from Lisa
are connected to Ling Yizhou.

420
00:30:11,485 --> 00:30:13,885
I have to find a way to support myself.

421
00:30:15,165 --> 00:30:16,205
I can lend you money.

422
00:30:17,605 --> 00:30:20,205
I can't keep living off borrowed money.

423
00:30:20,685 --> 00:30:23,485
I'm not handicapped. I can earn a living.

424
00:30:25,245 --> 00:30:28,285
Fine. But if anything happens...

425
00:30:30,165 --> 00:30:31,205
you know who to call.

426
00:30:32,645 --> 00:30:34,205
Got it, Mr. Superstar.

427
00:30:35,725 --> 00:30:36,765
-I'll get going now.
-OK.

428
00:30:50,125 --> 00:30:51,085
Hello, ma'am.

429
00:30:51,885 --> 00:30:53,045
Good morning.

430
00:30:53,565 --> 00:30:55,605
I called you yesterday. I'm Xia Lin.

431
00:30:55,685 --> 00:30:57,645
I see. You have quite a pleasant image.

432
00:30:58,845 --> 00:31:00,885
We sell KuGou products,

433
00:31:01,165 --> 00:31:02,525
so it's important to have charm.

434
00:31:02,725 --> 00:31:03,845
Remember to keep smiling.

435
00:31:03,925 --> 00:31:04,845
No problem.

436
00:31:05,405 --> 00:31:06,845
We'll pay you on a daily basis,

437
00:31:06,925 --> 00:31:08,845
based on your total sales amount.
Any questions?

438
00:31:08,925 --> 00:31:09,965
Nope.

439
00:31:10,045 --> 00:31:12,005
Great. Let's get you started quickly.

440
00:31:27,605 --> 00:31:28,605
Hello, sir.

441
00:31:29,285 --> 00:31:32,525
Would you be interested
in these KuGou Bluetooth headphones?

442
00:31:33,005 --> 00:31:35,845
-Sure.
-These headphones weigh only 13 grams.

443
00:31:36,245 --> 00:31:38,965
They're super comfortable.
They have a magnetic switch.

444
00:31:39,765 --> 00:31:41,685
Separating the earbuds turns them on.

445
00:31:41,765 --> 00:31:44,445
When you put them back together,
they turn off.

446
00:31:44,525 --> 00:31:45,605
Isn't that convenient?

447
00:31:46,245 --> 00:31:48,405
These headphones also have
a unique feature.

448
00:31:48,645 --> 00:31:50,525
They support voice-over song demand.

449
00:31:50,605 --> 00:31:55,165
Look. When I press this button and say,
"I want to listen to songs by Chu Yan,"

450
00:31:56,205 --> 00:31:58,325
-it will immediately play. Try it.
-Sure.

451
00:32:02,925 --> 00:32:03,965
The sound quality is nice.

452
00:32:05,485 --> 00:32:08,045
We have various colors
for you to choose from.

453
00:32:08,405 --> 00:32:09,485
I'll take this one.

454
00:32:09,925 --> 00:32:10,765
Thank you.

455
00:32:11,525 --> 00:32:15,805
Hi. Could you get this gentleman
the newest model in black?

456
00:32:15,885 --> 00:32:16,925
Sure. Of course.

457
00:32:17,005 --> 00:32:17,845
Please follow me.

458
00:32:20,325 --> 00:32:22,165
Is there anything you're looking for?

459
00:32:24,325 --> 00:32:25,285
This is a cool model.

460
00:32:25,685 --> 00:32:27,045
This color is quite nice.

461
00:32:30,525 --> 00:32:32,005
I'd also like to try it out.

462
00:32:32,525 --> 00:32:33,645
I want one, too.

463
00:32:36,725 --> 00:32:37,925
This model is really nice.

464
00:33:00,565 --> 00:33:02,445
We did unexpectedly well in sales today.

465
00:33:03,205 --> 00:33:04,405
Thanks to you, lucky star.

466
00:33:04,685 --> 00:33:06,285
I'll pay you double tomorrow.

467
00:33:10,805 --> 00:33:11,805
I won't be here tomorrow.

468
00:33:13,325 --> 00:33:15,445
Why not? I'm paying you double.

469
00:33:16,205 --> 00:33:18,245
I've never been so generous before.

470
00:33:18,725 --> 00:33:21,845
I'm treating you special
because you're our store's lucky star.

471
00:33:24,445 --> 00:33:25,565
Aren't you Xia Lin?

472
00:33:26,045 --> 00:33:27,525
No wonder you looked familiar.

473
00:33:29,365 --> 00:33:30,845
I'm not. You have the wrong person.

474
00:33:32,845 --> 00:33:34,965
Ma'am, look. That was her, right?

475
00:33:37,285 --> 00:33:40,445
Ling Yizhou publicly confesses
his love on a show...

476
00:33:41,405 --> 00:33:42,245
Ling Yizhou?

477
00:33:43,485 --> 00:33:45,485
Why would she come work
as a promotion girl here?

478
00:33:45,965 --> 00:33:48,205
-That's strange.
-The CEO of Lingshi Group?

479
00:33:48,285 --> 00:33:49,405
What was she doing here?

480
00:33:51,285 --> 00:33:53,445
Could it be that Lingshi
wants to acquire our company?

481
00:33:54,965 --> 00:33:56,685
-<i>Mrs. Ling. How are you?</i>
-Not good.

482
00:33:57,285 --> 00:33:59,605
<i>Are you going to interfere</i>
<i>with everything I do?</i>

483
00:34:00,165 --> 00:34:01,565
That job doesn't suit you.

484
00:34:02,005 --> 00:34:03,765
Does Ling Yizhou
have so much time to waste?

485
00:34:04,445 --> 00:34:07,005
Tell him to meet me at the
Civil Affairs Bureau for a divorce now.

486
00:34:07,965 --> 00:34:10,445
Never mind. Put him on the phone.

487
00:34:10,685 --> 00:34:12,885
Sorry, Mrs. Ling.
Mr. Ling is with a client right now.

488
00:34:13,445 --> 00:34:14,724
He means no harm.

489
00:34:15,085 --> 00:34:17,285
He just wants to save your relationship.

490
00:34:17,605 --> 00:34:18,684
<i>Mr. Wen,</i>

491
00:34:18,765 --> 00:34:21,644
I know you're speaking for him as usual.

492
00:34:21,724 --> 00:34:22,845
Please inform him,

493
00:34:23,204 --> 00:34:25,365
some things can't be saved.

494
00:34:25,845 --> 00:34:29,445
Besides, from what I see,
he doesn't even realize his wrongdoings.

495
00:34:35,085 --> 00:34:37,405
Weren't you filming overseas?
Why are you back?

496
00:34:38,605 --> 00:34:40,365
I know what happened
between you and Xia Lin.

497
00:34:41,805 --> 00:34:42,925
You shouldn't have done that.

498
00:34:46,925 --> 00:34:49,365
That's between the two of us.
It's none of your business.

499
00:34:51,045 --> 00:34:52,125
I have to get to a meeting.

500
00:34:57,125 --> 00:34:58,204
What are you doing?

501
00:34:58,845 --> 00:35:00,325
You're just pushing her further away.

502
00:35:01,005 --> 00:35:04,245
She's my wife,
so I won't allow her to leave my side.

503
00:35:04,605 --> 00:35:06,805
Yes, she is your wife.

504
00:35:07,765 --> 00:35:09,925
But she also has
her own thoughts and feelings.

505
00:35:10,605 --> 00:35:13,045
You can't just manipulate her life
as you wish.

506
00:35:13,125 --> 00:35:14,205
Nobody can accept that.

507
00:35:14,485 --> 00:35:15,765
I'm doing it for her own good.

508
00:35:16,085 --> 00:35:17,085
For her own good?

509
00:35:18,325 --> 00:35:21,125
Many people have used that
as an excuse to harm others.

510
00:35:23,085 --> 00:35:24,725
Loving someone involves respecting them.

511
00:35:24,805 --> 00:35:26,925
Love with an imbalance of power
will never last.

512
00:35:29,245 --> 00:35:31,885
She'll leave you in the end.

513
00:35:32,325 --> 00:35:33,325
Do you know her that well?

514
00:35:34,325 --> 00:35:35,605
As your mutual friend,

515
00:35:36,125 --> 00:35:37,605
-I'm more objective--
-Do you love her?

516
00:35:38,405 --> 00:35:39,445
Isn't the timing perfect?

517
00:35:39,725 --> 00:35:42,085
You can swoop in
when we're having a crisis.

518
00:35:46,125 --> 00:35:48,845
That's for what you did to Xia Lin.

519
00:35:54,085 --> 00:35:56,845
That's for doubting our friendship.

520
00:35:57,525 --> 00:35:59,045
I'm telling you, Ling Yizhou.

521
00:35:59,125 --> 00:36:02,365
It's easy to hurt someone who loves you,
and that's what you've done today.

522
00:36:03,725 --> 00:36:05,565
You managed to hurt
two people who love you.

523
00:36:23,845 --> 00:36:24,685
Mr. Ling,

524
00:36:25,005 --> 00:36:28,165
your wife wants to meet you at
the Civil Affairs Bureau to get a divorce.

525
00:36:59,525 --> 00:37:01,805
Your place looks better than I expected.

526
00:37:01,885 --> 00:37:03,285
Do you have any manners?

527
00:37:03,365 --> 00:37:04,645
I didn't even invite you in yet.

528
00:37:05,565 --> 00:37:09,845
Manners? I fought Ling for you
and you're lecturing me about manners?

529
00:37:10,245 --> 00:37:11,085
Are you serious?

530
00:37:12,365 --> 00:37:13,725
I punched him hard, twice.

531
00:37:14,365 --> 00:37:15,525
My hand still hurts.

532
00:37:15,605 --> 00:37:19,165
Is he... doing OK?

533
00:37:20,365 --> 00:37:22,125
Can't you take a firm stand?

534
00:37:25,085 --> 00:37:26,845
Your lord is hungry. Serve me some food.

535
00:37:28,285 --> 00:37:31,285
My lord, I only have
instant noodles to serve you.

536
00:37:32,245 --> 00:37:34,405
But I have a lot of flavors.
Take your pick.

537
00:37:35,365 --> 00:37:38,165
I thought you were a celebrity.

538
00:37:38,245 --> 00:37:39,965
Can't you treat yourself a little more?

539
00:37:41,325 --> 00:37:44,565
I'm deep in debt right now.
I'm grateful that I have enough to eat.

540
00:37:44,645 --> 00:37:46,365
If you're going to be picky, go dine out!

541
00:37:46,445 --> 00:37:47,365
-What's this?
-For you.

542
00:37:47,445 --> 00:37:48,405
What is it?

543
00:37:48,925 --> 00:37:50,925
An ice pack. Didn't you hurt your hand?

544
00:37:52,485 --> 00:37:53,485
No need for that.

545
00:38:01,125 --> 00:38:04,605
You're so immature. Couldn't you settle it
in a more civilized way?

546
00:38:05,005 --> 00:38:07,205
Why get in a fight? So childish.

547
00:38:09,725 --> 00:38:11,405
It's because he told me...

548
00:38:12,325 --> 00:38:13,165
Told you what?

549
00:38:16,045 --> 00:38:16,965
Nothing.

550
00:38:17,725 --> 00:38:18,725
Get back to cooking.

551
00:38:18,805 --> 00:38:20,285
Fine. I'll cook you some noodles.

552
00:38:41,365 --> 00:38:42,445
What are you looking at

553
00:38:42,685 --> 00:38:45,285
Nothing. I'll get cooking.

554
00:39:07,565 --> 00:39:09,325
You hate An Ran for plotting against you.

555
00:39:09,405 --> 00:39:11,885
But how are you different from her?

556
00:39:12,885 --> 00:39:14,165
I never meant to hurt you.

557
00:39:14,565 --> 00:39:15,845
You hurt me mentally.

558
00:39:16,205 --> 00:39:17,725
Did you ever consider my feelings?

559
00:39:17,805 --> 00:39:22,285
I was 21. Fresh out of college, bright
future ahead. Then, a death sentence.

560
00:39:22,645 --> 00:39:24,125
You only thought about what you want.

561
00:39:24,365 --> 00:39:27,605
Do you know how much pain
I suffered back then?

562
00:39:28,085 --> 00:39:29,685
What am I to you?

563
00:39:29,765 --> 00:39:33,205
A puppet for you to manipulate?
A pet for your amusement?

564
00:39:33,525 --> 00:39:35,725
I only ask for honesty and respect.

565
00:39:36,445 --> 00:39:38,565
No surveillance, no shadowing, no lies.

566
00:39:42,845 --> 00:39:44,285
I'm telling you, Ling Yizhou.

567
00:39:44,765 --> 00:39:47,765
It's easy to hurt someone who loves you,
and that's what you've done today.

568
00:39:48,925 --> 00:39:50,765
You managed to hurt
two people who love you.

569
00:40:18,325 --> 00:40:20,965
Instant noodles are the best
when it's raining.

570
00:40:24,965 --> 00:40:25,885
Why are you so quiet?

571
00:40:27,045 --> 00:40:28,165
What are you doing tomorrow?

572
00:40:30,605 --> 00:40:31,485
Nothing.

573
00:40:32,845 --> 00:40:35,325
I have to browse through job ads later.

574
00:40:37,765 --> 00:40:40,605
Alright.
To thank you for the feast tonight,

575
00:40:41,085 --> 00:40:42,525
I'll give you a job.

576
00:40:43,405 --> 00:40:44,245
Really?

577
00:40:45,045 --> 00:40:45,885
Of course...

578
00:40:46,125 --> 00:40:46,965
not.

579
00:40:49,365 --> 00:40:51,525
I'll send you the address later.
Just show up at nine.

580
00:40:51,845 --> 00:40:52,685
What job is it?

581
00:40:52,965 --> 00:40:55,165
You'll find out tomorrow. See you then.

582
00:40:56,765 --> 00:40:57,925
Drive safely.

583
00:40:58,485 --> 00:40:59,685
-Bye.
-Bye.

584
00:42:09,605 --> 00:42:10,725
I think...

585
00:42:12,565 --> 00:42:13,885
we can give it a try.

586
00:42:14,525 --> 00:42:15,765
Let's get married.

587
00:42:26,045 --> 00:42:28,445
You did so many things
that touched my heart.

588
00:42:28,525 --> 00:42:30,485
And now you're taking it all back.

589
00:42:32,285 --> 00:42:34,965
You can't accept the current situation,
so I have to deal with it.

590
00:42:35,925 --> 00:42:38,165
Don't you see how unfair this is?

591
00:42:38,565 --> 00:42:42,245
Did you ever think
that I'd be sad about my illness?

592
00:42:47,645 --> 00:42:51,685
Your love is too overwhelming
and too selfish.

593
00:43:17,445 --> 00:43:18,285
Director Ling.

594
00:43:18,565 --> 00:43:19,405
How did it go?

595
00:43:20,005 --> 00:43:22,685
<i>Mrs. Ling said</i>
<i>she used to rent that place.</i>

596
00:43:24,525 --> 00:43:26,365
Purchase it from the landlord immediately.

597
00:43:26,565 --> 00:43:27,405
Yes, sir.

598
00:45:03,645 --> 00:45:05,405
Subtitle translation by Alice Hsing

599
00:45:05,485 --> 00:45:07,325
Come bike with me.

600
00:45:07,405 --> 00:45:09,125
You'll get paid handsomely.

601
00:45:09,205 --> 00:45:12,765
Am I glowing to you right now?

602
00:45:13,285 --> 00:45:14,245
I'm absolutely perfect.

603
00:45:18,605 --> 00:45:19,445
Ling?

604
00:45:19,525 --> 00:45:21,005
How's the investigation into Chu?

605
00:45:21,085 --> 00:45:22,645
Everything is pretty much in place.

606
00:45:23,685 --> 00:45:24,525
Set things in action.

607
00:45:26,045 --> 00:45:28,645
You rotten child.
If Ling Yizhou finds out,

608
00:45:28,725 --> 00:45:30,485
the Chu family's prosperity
will be ruined!
