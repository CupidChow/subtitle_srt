1
00:00:13,325 --> 00:00:15,165
Your beloved wife has disappeared

2
00:00:15,245 --> 00:00:16,925
and you're out with another woman?

3
00:00:17,805 --> 00:00:21,005
Ling Yizhou, you're too big a loser
to be my friend.

4
00:00:21,765 --> 00:00:22,925
I'm telling you,

5
00:00:23,005 --> 00:00:24,605
if you don't take care of Xia Lin,

6
00:00:25,165 --> 00:00:26,805
I, Chu Yan, will still protect her.

7
00:00:27,165 --> 00:00:29,085
What are you going to threaten him with?

8
00:00:29,485 --> 00:00:31,845
I just want to see him lose
the woman he loves

9
00:00:32,245 --> 00:00:34,205
and never be happy.

10
00:00:34,285 --> 00:00:35,605
I've never done anything to him.

11
00:00:36,045 --> 00:00:38,165
I can't figure out why he did this.

12
00:00:39,285 --> 00:00:42,365
The only possible reason
is because of you.

13
00:00:42,725 --> 00:00:46,485
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

14
00:02:13,365 --> 00:02:15,764
EPISODE 18

15
00:02:26,605 --> 00:02:27,605
I need some water.

16
00:02:31,045 --> 00:02:32,325
We don't have any.

17
00:02:35,325 --> 00:02:38,565
Whether you're faking it or not,
you'll have to wait.

18
00:02:41,485 --> 00:02:43,845
Pregnant women need more water
than normal people.

19
00:02:45,765 --> 00:02:48,805
You wouldn't want anything to happen,
would you?

20
00:02:49,565 --> 00:02:50,885
There's a rest stop ahead.

21
00:02:52,365 --> 00:02:53,445
I'll go buy some.

22
00:03:18,885 --> 00:03:20,325
What are you trying to do?

23
00:03:22,085 --> 00:03:23,525
This is a basic physical need.

24
00:03:26,685 --> 00:03:27,565
So...

25
00:03:31,165 --> 00:03:32,965
are you going to sell me abroad?

26
00:03:37,485 --> 00:03:38,325
Don't worry.

27
00:03:39,365 --> 00:03:41,325
The police have sealed the highways.

28
00:03:43,205 --> 00:03:44,045
We can't get off now.

29
00:03:54,645 --> 00:03:56,045
I need to go to the restroom.

30
00:04:02,125 --> 00:04:05,405
Tell me what you're planning to do.

31
00:04:08,405 --> 00:04:11,245
During the first trimester,
pregnant ladies need to pee a lot.

32
00:04:12,725 --> 00:04:14,285
I swear on the life of my child,

33
00:04:14,965 --> 00:04:16,325
I won't run away.

34
00:04:34,605 --> 00:04:35,605
Is that...

35
00:04:37,205 --> 00:04:38,045
a gun?

36
00:04:39,725 --> 00:04:43,485
If you behave, we'll be just fine.

37
00:04:44,725 --> 00:04:46,205
I'm not hurting you right now...

38
00:04:47,565 --> 00:04:51,245
but I didn't say
I won't hurt Ling Yizhou's child.

39
00:05:10,965 --> 00:05:13,085
-Officer.
-Check the security cameras.

40
00:05:13,645 --> 00:05:15,205
-Got it.
-You called the police?

41
00:05:15,285 --> 00:05:17,405
-I did.
-Did you see this woman?

42
00:05:19,125 --> 00:05:19,965
Yes, that's her.

43
00:05:20,405 --> 00:05:21,845
Please tell us what you saw.

44
00:05:21,925 --> 00:05:23,365
It was like this...

45
00:05:23,445 --> 00:05:26,805
I was in the restroom.
A young man came in with his wife.

46
00:05:27,965 --> 00:05:29,205
This is the ladies' room.

47
00:05:29,725 --> 00:05:32,165
I'm sorry. My wife is pregnant.

48
00:05:32,245 --> 00:05:33,405
I'm worried she'll fall.

49
00:05:36,725 --> 00:05:39,165
Be careful. I'll wait for you here.

50
00:05:50,925 --> 00:05:53,765
Don't worry.
I just need to borrow some tissues.

51
00:06:01,925 --> 00:06:04,725
Hello, miss. Could I borrow some tissues?

52
00:06:05,245 --> 00:06:06,085
Sure.

53
00:06:14,245 --> 00:06:15,245
Thank you.

54
00:06:22,445 --> 00:06:25,205
I thought it was strange,
so I called the police.

55
00:06:25,525 --> 00:06:26,725
Was this the man?

56
00:06:27,845 --> 00:06:29,045
Yes. That's him.

57
00:06:29,125 --> 00:06:31,485
Mr. Wang, we've found him
in the security footage as well.

58
00:06:31,565 --> 00:06:33,525
They're heading north in a black SUV.

59
00:06:33,925 --> 00:06:35,845
-Report this to the north exit.
-Yes, sir.

60
00:06:36,205 --> 00:06:37,565
We'll start searching north.

61
00:06:37,645 --> 00:06:38,885
Have someone take her testimony.

62
00:06:38,965 --> 00:06:39,805
Yes, sir.

63
00:06:40,285 --> 00:06:41,125
Please come with me.

64
00:06:41,845 --> 00:06:42,685
-Mr. Wang.
-This way.

65
00:06:43,245 --> 00:06:45,205
Someone has been covering up
Nan Jintian's tracks.

66
00:06:45,285 --> 00:06:48,645
Could this slip-up be an intentional clue
they were leaving us?

67
00:06:52,805 --> 00:06:54,805
Have someone search along the highway.

68
00:06:54,885 --> 00:06:57,325
Get another unit to search local roads.

69
00:06:57,405 --> 00:06:58,565
-Yes, sir.
-Let's go.

70
00:07:21,485 --> 00:07:24,645
What are you trying to do now, Miss Xia?

71
00:07:28,045 --> 00:07:29,565
Haven't you been watching me?

72
00:07:32,445 --> 00:07:34,645
How would I be able to get past you
and ask for help?

73
00:07:36,525 --> 00:07:41,525
Ling Yizhou and the police
are searching along the highway.

74
00:07:42,605 --> 00:07:44,445
If you didn't get someone
to call the police,

75
00:07:44,845 --> 00:07:48,045
they wouldn't be on to us this fast.

76
00:07:54,045 --> 00:07:57,205
Fine. I did it.

77
00:08:01,165 --> 00:08:02,565
You did it?

78
00:08:11,005 --> 00:08:12,325
You did it...

79
00:08:14,965 --> 00:08:16,165
You did it.

80
00:08:17,685 --> 00:08:21,565
I only promised I wouldn't run away.
I didn't say I wouldn't do anything else.

81
00:08:23,645 --> 00:08:25,085
You can't hurt me and the child.

82
00:08:25,765 --> 00:08:27,605
I told you I'd be kind if you behave.

83
00:08:30,845 --> 00:08:31,765
But...

84
00:08:32,925 --> 00:08:34,645
no matter how hard they search...

85
00:08:35,925 --> 00:08:37,525
they won't be able to find us here.

86
00:08:39,085 --> 00:08:39,924
Why?

87
00:08:57,645 --> 00:09:00,125
Are you sad that I tricked Ling Yizhou?

88
00:09:06,165 --> 00:09:09,685
They'd never think
that I'd head backwards.

89
00:09:12,125 --> 00:09:13,485
I have to thank you.

90
00:09:14,285 --> 00:09:15,645
You added a lot of dramatic effect

91
00:09:16,245 --> 00:09:18,005
to this play I'm directing right now.

92
00:09:20,205 --> 00:09:21,885
You let them find us on purpose.

93
00:09:24,045 --> 00:09:28,045
As a friend, if you want to act,
of course I have to help you.

94
00:09:32,645 --> 00:09:36,565
Showing your face like that,
what if they put you on the wanted list?

95
00:09:38,525 --> 00:09:40,885
After this, I'll go abroad.

96
00:09:50,045 --> 00:09:51,685
Want to come with me?

97
00:09:54,765 --> 00:09:55,925
You're a lunatic.

98
00:10:00,485 --> 00:10:03,525
You're pregnant.
You should stay in a good mood.

99
00:10:17,285 --> 00:10:18,765
<i>I need to find another way.</i>

100
00:10:51,045 --> 00:10:54,365
Ling Yizhou. Even though
you haven't got your memory back yet,

101
00:10:54,725 --> 00:10:57,365
you don't hate me as much now, do you?

102
00:11:04,445 --> 00:11:05,645
Never mind. Don't answer that.

103
00:11:06,125 --> 00:11:08,165
The truth will probably make me sad,

104
00:11:08,245 --> 00:11:09,565
but I don't want you to lie to me.

105
00:11:16,605 --> 00:11:17,805
I'll give you a ride tomorrow.

106
00:11:19,445 --> 00:11:20,965
You're so nice, hubby.

107
00:12:37,485 --> 00:12:40,325
<i>I have to leave this place</i>
<i>before Nan Jintian makes his next move.</i>

108
00:12:41,205 --> 00:12:43,565
<i>I can't give him another chance</i>
<i>to trick Ling Yizhou.</i>

109
00:12:51,525 --> 00:12:53,085
This fruit is for you.

110
00:12:55,125 --> 00:12:55,965
Tongtong.

111
00:12:57,005 --> 00:12:58,085
Let's chat.

112
00:12:58,565 --> 00:13:00,205
He doesn't like it when I talk to you.

113
00:13:01,245 --> 00:13:02,085
Why?

114
00:13:02,765 --> 00:13:04,285
Because you get ideas.

115
00:13:06,765 --> 00:13:09,685
Then have some fruit with me.

116
00:13:11,325 --> 00:13:12,645
I can't eat this much anyway.

117
00:13:26,685 --> 00:13:27,925
You like Nan Jintian?

118
00:13:28,005 --> 00:13:28,845
No, I don't.

119
00:13:31,645 --> 00:13:35,645
I admire him and respect him.

120
00:13:37,285 --> 00:13:40,805
Women always fall in love
with those they admire.

121
00:13:42,205 --> 00:13:44,765
To me, Ling Yizhou is
the most amazing man in the world.

122
00:13:45,725 --> 00:13:47,245
It's nothing to be ashamed of.

123
00:13:48,165 --> 00:13:49,485
You're still young.

124
00:13:50,285 --> 00:13:52,245
Why are you limiting yourself?

125
00:13:56,805 --> 00:14:00,445
When I told you my story,
I wasn't completely lying.

126
00:14:01,965 --> 00:14:04,245
My father did owe money
to the loan sharks.

127
00:14:05,485 --> 00:14:07,245
He gave me to them as payment...

128
00:14:08,965 --> 00:14:10,005
and ran away.

129
00:14:12,165 --> 00:14:13,765
Mr. Nan paid off the debt for me.

130
00:14:14,365 --> 00:14:18,885
So, from that day on,
I decided to serve him.

131
00:14:22,045 --> 00:14:27,525
Tongtong, you should be
in college right now.

132
00:14:28,645 --> 00:14:30,485
You should be happy
and carefree at school,

133
00:14:31,365 --> 00:14:34,245
not running around like a fugitive
with Nan Jintian.

134
00:14:34,765 --> 00:14:37,445
As long as he needs me, I won't leave him.

135
00:14:39,725 --> 00:14:42,285
Are you happy following him around?

136
00:14:43,245 --> 00:14:44,085
I...

137
00:15:01,205 --> 00:15:02,045
Mr. Ling.

138
00:15:03,325 --> 00:15:05,085
Mr. Wang just called.

139
00:15:05,605 --> 00:15:08,405
They didn't find Nan Jintian
at any highway checkpoint.

140
00:15:08,485 --> 00:15:11,405
We can be sure
that he's still in the city right now.

141
00:15:13,365 --> 00:15:15,005
Keep investigating him.

142
00:15:16,485 --> 00:15:18,845
I need to know all the properties
he owns in the country.

143
00:15:19,365 --> 00:15:20,485
All the people he knows.

144
00:15:21,525 --> 00:15:23,245
Everything about him.

145
00:15:23,965 --> 00:15:24,805
Yes, sir.

146
00:15:34,165 --> 00:15:35,965
NAN JINTIAN

147
00:15:36,805 --> 00:15:41,005
Do you remember the last time you smiled?

148
00:15:45,045 --> 00:15:47,765
Even if you became my assistant
for the wrong reasons,

149
00:15:48,685 --> 00:15:52,085
I could feel that you were happy
when you were with me.

150
00:15:53,085 --> 00:15:53,925
Right?

151
00:15:55,085 --> 00:15:55,925
Yes.

152
00:15:58,525 --> 00:16:01,445
I'll never be able
to live like that again.

153
00:16:02,885 --> 00:16:05,125
But that's not important.

154
00:16:09,645 --> 00:16:12,685
Alright. I can't change your mind.
I give up.

155
00:16:13,765 --> 00:16:17,005
Why didn't I ever notice
that you're so stubborn?

156
00:16:17,085 --> 00:16:18,005
You're like a mule.

157
00:16:19,325 --> 00:16:22,605
Xia Lin, I should apologize to you.

158
00:16:23,765 --> 00:16:26,045
I know that you cared about me genuinely.

159
00:16:26,125 --> 00:16:27,685
I'm the one in the wrong.

160
00:16:28,845 --> 00:16:32,405
It's fine.
You're just following your heart.

161
00:16:34,845 --> 00:16:38,325
Between me and Nan Jintian, you chose him.

162
00:16:43,565 --> 00:16:47,085
Even though I don't know
why Mr. Nan is doing this...

163
00:16:48,125 --> 00:16:51,325
I can tell that
he doesn't want to hurt you.

164
00:16:54,405 --> 00:16:55,725
I've changed my mindset.

165
00:16:56,645 --> 00:17:00,205
This all happened because of the feud
between Nan Jintian and Ling Yizhou.

166
00:17:00,805 --> 00:17:02,125
We're not the main characters.

167
00:17:02,805 --> 00:17:04,405
My most important task here

168
00:17:04,965 --> 00:17:07,085
is to take care of myself and the baby.

169
00:17:08,205 --> 00:17:11,045
I don't have the energy
to care about anything else now.

170
00:17:11,485 --> 00:17:12,445
Really?

171
00:17:13,165 --> 00:17:14,124
Of course.

172
00:17:14,405 --> 00:17:15,245
That's great.

173
00:17:19,604 --> 00:17:21,445
Tongtong, I'd like some warm water.

174
00:17:21,765 --> 00:17:22,765
Could you get me some?

175
00:17:23,485 --> 00:17:24,805
Warm water? Sure.

176
00:17:34,245 --> 00:17:36,205
Why did you lock the door?

177
00:17:37,165 --> 00:17:38,245
Open the door!

178
00:17:39,405 --> 00:17:41,005
-What's her passcode?
-Give me my phone.

179
00:17:43,165 --> 00:17:44,205
Mr. Nan is coming.

180
00:17:44,285 --> 00:17:46,525
Open the door!

181
00:17:48,845 --> 00:17:49,925
What's going on?

182
00:17:52,965 --> 00:17:55,485
She took my phone and locked the door.

183
00:17:55,565 --> 00:17:56,445
I'm sorry.

184
00:17:58,685 --> 00:17:59,525
Step aside.

185
00:18:07,325 --> 00:18:11,925
Are you misbehaving
because I was too nice to you?

186
00:18:30,765 --> 00:18:31,605
Apologize.

187
00:18:32,525 --> 00:18:33,605
Say you're sorry.

188
00:18:34,525 --> 00:18:36,485
Beg for forgiveness and I won't hurt you.

189
00:18:38,765 --> 00:18:40,205
You should apologize.

190
00:18:40,845 --> 00:18:41,685
Xia Lin.

191
00:18:43,085 --> 00:18:45,805
Why do you have the courage
to keep testing my limits?

192
00:18:47,405 --> 00:18:48,805
Because we're friends.

193
00:18:51,845 --> 00:18:53,085
Get over yourself.

194
00:18:53,445 --> 00:18:55,365
You're just one of my pawns.

195
00:18:56,325 --> 00:18:57,245
You know it.

196
00:18:58,285 --> 00:19:02,045
I treated you as my friend.
That's why you don't want to hurt me.

197
00:19:04,725 --> 00:19:07,605
You'd cast me aside for Ling Yizhou
without even hesitating.

198
00:19:08,245 --> 00:19:10,165
I don't need a friend like you.

199
00:19:11,005 --> 00:19:12,805
Nan Jintian, you're a coward.

200
00:19:13,245 --> 00:19:15,965
You're afraid of being abandoned,
so you've abandoned everyone first.

201
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:18,125
You fear loneliness more than anyone else.

202
00:19:23,085 --> 00:19:25,525
Yes. You're right.

203
00:19:27,765 --> 00:19:29,845
But my main act hasn't even started yet.

204
00:19:30,285 --> 00:19:32,125
Of course I don't want you to die.

205
00:19:34,325 --> 00:19:38,285
If Ling Yizhou saw you
like this right now,

206
00:19:39,085 --> 00:19:41,285
-What would he do?
-Let go.

207
00:19:44,245 --> 00:19:45,805
My game isn't over yet.

208
00:19:47,965 --> 00:19:52,045
When I'm done, I'll let you see him.

209
00:19:53,645 --> 00:19:54,765
Before that...

210
00:19:55,845 --> 00:19:58,045
you'd better not change my script.

211
00:19:59,325 --> 00:20:01,045
Or else you'll regret it.

212
00:20:08,645 --> 00:20:10,445
Have you seen a cat with a mouse before?

213
00:20:13,365 --> 00:20:17,245
Cats love playing around with mice.

214
00:20:19,005 --> 00:20:20,405
But those stupid big cats...

215
00:20:21,365 --> 00:20:22,885
always let the mice get away.

216
00:20:24,205 --> 00:20:25,205
I'm different though.

217
00:20:28,525 --> 00:20:29,885
I have you as a weapon.

218
00:20:31,165 --> 00:20:32,645
So I can enjoy...

219
00:20:34,085 --> 00:20:36,685
the sensation of manipulating Ling Yizhou.

220
00:21:10,085 --> 00:21:11,565
If I didn't bring you home,

221
00:21:12,205 --> 00:21:14,245
who knows who we'd see you with
in the news tomorrow?

222
00:21:14,965 --> 00:21:17,365
How will you explain this to Xia Lin
when she gets back?

223
00:21:23,605 --> 00:21:24,845
I regret it.

224
00:21:27,565 --> 00:21:28,525
What do you regret?

225
00:21:29,045 --> 00:21:31,165
I shouldn't have approached Mumu
in the first place.

226
00:21:32,845 --> 00:21:34,205
I was greedy.

227
00:21:35,685 --> 00:21:37,365
I ruined her life.

228
00:21:38,485 --> 00:21:39,885
That's enough of that.

229
00:21:40,445 --> 00:21:42,165
Can't you be clearer when you talk?

230
00:21:44,445 --> 00:21:47,405
Nan Jintian only came back
after Mumu and I got married.

231
00:21:49,205 --> 00:21:51,285
His target has always been me.

232
00:21:51,845 --> 00:21:53,165
If his target is you,

233
00:21:53,725 --> 00:21:56,085
why isn't he torturing you
instead of Xia Lin?

234
00:21:56,485 --> 00:21:57,485
Don't you understand?

235
00:21:59,685 --> 00:22:02,445
Only by attacking someone's weakness
can you really defeat them.

236
00:22:04,285 --> 00:22:05,765
Mumu is my weakness.

237
00:22:08,405 --> 00:22:09,805
I have another theory.

238
00:22:10,325 --> 00:22:11,805
Maybe he's always loved you.

239
00:22:12,365 --> 00:22:14,445
So he wants to get rid
of all the women by your side.

240
00:22:15,045 --> 00:22:16,725
He even got rid of An Ran.

241
00:22:19,845 --> 00:22:21,565
Then why didn't he get rid of you?

242
00:22:24,565 --> 00:22:25,765
I did disappear for a while.

243
00:22:27,285 --> 00:22:31,205
But you didn't steal his company
or his woman.

244
00:22:31,285 --> 00:22:34,045
You even gave him a stepmother.
Why would he hate you?

245
00:22:36,605 --> 00:22:38,005
From what I know...

246
00:22:40,645 --> 00:22:44,165
he's probably doing this
to avenge his biological mother.

247
00:22:46,565 --> 00:22:48,125
I'm fine now. You can leave.

248
00:22:52,765 --> 00:22:55,485
Are you going to dump me after using me?

249
00:22:56,365 --> 00:22:59,325
I haven't stayed
in your guest room here before.

250
00:23:00,085 --> 00:23:01,125
Let me stay the night.

251
00:23:07,485 --> 00:23:08,525
Thanks, brother.

252
00:23:09,965 --> 00:23:11,285
Ugh... That's enough.

253
00:23:12,365 --> 00:23:13,645
You'll get Xia Lin back soon.

254
00:23:15,045 --> 00:23:16,525
Then, I'll get to meet my godson.

255
00:23:17,245 --> 00:23:19,965
I'm telling you,
stop thinking about my wife.

256
00:23:20,445 --> 00:23:22,205
And don't think about my son either.

257
00:23:24,485 --> 00:23:25,565
You're thinking too much.

258
00:23:37,045 --> 00:23:37,885
What's going on?

259
00:23:38,445 --> 00:23:39,565
She didn't want to eat.

260
00:23:40,965 --> 00:23:42,365
Let her starve for a meal or two.

261
00:23:42,765 --> 00:23:44,285
But she also didn't eat this morning.

262
00:23:49,485 --> 00:23:50,325
So annoying.

263
00:24:11,445 --> 00:24:12,805
I'm not Ling Yizhou.

264
00:24:14,285 --> 00:24:16,045
I won't play your childish games with you.

265
00:24:19,565 --> 00:24:21,085
I'm not trying to cause you trouble.

266
00:24:21,765 --> 00:24:23,045
Please don't trouble me as well.

267
00:24:23,645 --> 00:24:24,965
Don't try to make me pity you.

268
00:24:25,805 --> 00:24:28,405
I won't let you starve to death
or die of dehydration.

269
00:24:29,085 --> 00:24:31,005
You're the star of my show.

270
00:24:31,885 --> 00:24:33,925
How could I let you exit
the stage so soon?

271
00:24:35,885 --> 00:24:36,805
Eat.

272
00:24:46,525 --> 00:24:47,565
What if I don't eat?

273
00:25:00,645 --> 00:25:03,205
I'm going to see Ling Yizhou
in a few days.

274
00:25:03,965 --> 00:25:06,285
I wouldn't mind sending him
a piece of you.

275
00:25:09,525 --> 00:25:13,605
You're busy running away from him.
Why would you go meet him?

276
00:25:13,965 --> 00:25:15,325
Why not?

277
00:25:17,405 --> 00:25:18,685
Oh, I forgot to tell you.

278
00:25:19,005 --> 00:25:21,525
I sent him a present a few days ago.

279
00:25:22,365 --> 00:25:23,205
What?

280
00:25:24,725 --> 00:25:26,045
Your ultrasound pregnancy scan.

281
00:25:28,805 --> 00:25:30,085
I'm kind of sad that

282
00:25:30,485 --> 00:25:32,445
I didn't get to see
the expression on his face.

283
00:25:33,565 --> 00:25:36,645
So this time,
I need to go see it in person.

284
00:25:37,205 --> 00:25:39,845
I can send him a message from you,
if you have anything to say.

285
00:25:41,125 --> 00:25:42,005
I don't.

286
00:25:46,765 --> 00:25:47,845
Eat your food.

287
00:25:49,885 --> 00:25:51,165
Don't test my patience.

288
00:25:56,765 --> 00:25:57,605
I'll eat.

289
00:25:59,085 --> 00:26:01,405
But I have one request.

290
00:26:05,725 --> 00:26:06,565
What?

291
00:26:08,445 --> 00:26:09,965
I want paper and colored pencils.

292
00:26:11,005 --> 00:26:12,125
If you don't let me out,

293
00:26:12,725 --> 00:26:15,205
I should at least have something
to help pass the time.

294
00:26:20,725 --> 00:26:21,845
What are you trying to do?

295
00:26:22,765 --> 00:26:25,365
Apart from acting and being beautiful,

296
00:26:25,445 --> 00:26:26,645
I also have a lot of hobbies.

297
00:26:27,445 --> 00:26:28,845
One of them is drawing.

298
00:26:29,525 --> 00:26:32,045
You can ask Yang Tong
if you don't believe me.

299
00:26:35,205 --> 00:26:40,165
Very well. I look forward
to seeing your masterpieces.

300
00:27:32,085 --> 00:27:33,005
This bear is you?

301
00:27:36,965 --> 00:27:40,525
I'm not good at drawing people,
so I draw cartoon figures.

302
00:27:55,805 --> 00:27:58,005
These two are more realistic.

303
00:27:59,005 --> 00:28:00,005
What about that one?

304
00:28:04,965 --> 00:28:05,925
Idealistic.

305
00:28:06,885 --> 00:28:11,445
This is my ideal home and life.

306
00:28:26,765 --> 00:28:27,925
Can I have this one?

307
00:28:29,725 --> 00:28:32,165
If I say no, you won't take it?

308
00:28:35,285 --> 00:28:38,605
Don't worry. I'll put this to good use.

309
00:29:15,445 --> 00:29:16,285
<i>Hello?</i>

310
00:29:17,485 --> 00:29:20,605
Let's meet up. Just the two of us.

311
00:29:54,765 --> 00:29:58,085
Cell reception is bad here. They won't
be able to contact you for a while.

312
00:29:58,645 --> 00:30:00,325
If they want to find me, they'll find me.

313
00:30:01,205 --> 00:30:02,885
It's the same when I want to find someone.

314
00:30:04,565 --> 00:30:05,925
I heard that my company

315
00:30:06,885 --> 00:30:08,485
has been stealing business from Lingshi.

316
00:30:09,045 --> 00:30:10,565
They don't know how we're related.

317
00:30:11,405 --> 00:30:12,725
I apologize for them.

318
00:30:13,325 --> 00:30:15,005
You should be sincere with your apology.

319
00:30:16,725 --> 00:30:17,765
Tell me where Xia Lin is.

320
00:30:19,965 --> 00:30:20,965
Are you worried about her?

321
00:30:21,405 --> 00:30:23,685
I like to deal with problems
the fastest way.

322
00:30:25,045 --> 00:30:26,965
Give me Xia Lin,
I'll give you anything you want.

323
00:30:28,765 --> 00:30:31,845
Xia Lin is your woman.

324
00:30:32,725 --> 00:30:34,445
Why are you asking me for her?

325
00:30:35,405 --> 00:30:38,445
I just came here today
to catch up with you.

326
00:30:42,005 --> 00:30:43,805
If anything happens to Xia Lin...

327
00:30:45,805 --> 00:30:47,565
you and the Nan family
will go down with her.

328
00:30:54,005 --> 00:30:56,365
This trip has been worth it.

329
00:30:57,365 --> 00:31:00,165
I remember the last time
you were this mad. I think it was...

330
00:31:01,165 --> 00:31:02,605
on your eighth birthday.

331
00:31:08,525 --> 00:31:11,205
My best friend drew this today.

332
00:31:12,525 --> 00:31:13,725
Take a look.

333
00:31:49,445 --> 00:31:50,605
<i>It's Mumu's handwriting.</i>

334
00:31:54,605 --> 00:31:58,605
<i>Bears, clothes, a TV.</i>

335
00:31:59,725 --> 00:32:01,485
<i>What do these things mean?</i>

336
00:32:14,005 --> 00:32:15,045
<i>Our date.</i>

337
00:32:23,125 --> 00:32:24,845
<i>Mumu remembers the details of our date,</i>

338
00:32:24,925 --> 00:32:26,245
<i>but she missed something.</i>

339
00:32:26,685 --> 00:32:28,725
We don't have to rush to do those things

340
00:32:28,805 --> 00:32:30,485
or else we won't be able to enjoy life.

341
00:32:31,005 --> 00:32:32,765
Those things will lose
their meaning as well.

342
00:32:33,405 --> 00:32:35,845
But I want to go see dolphins.

343
00:32:37,245 --> 00:32:39,205
If we can't go this time,
we'll go next time.

344
00:32:39,525 --> 00:32:40,925
I'll take you out to sea.

345
00:32:41,485 --> 00:32:42,365
You promise?

346
00:32:42,965 --> 00:32:46,405
Then I want to see
the sunrise and sunset, too.

347
00:32:54,805 --> 00:32:57,165
Mr. Wang, I know where Mumu is.

348
00:33:11,245 --> 00:33:12,205
Let go of me!

349
00:33:18,045 --> 00:33:20,645
I'll let you meet the person
you've been missing.

350
00:33:22,045 --> 00:33:23,165
Didn't you draw that picture

351
00:33:23,245 --> 00:33:26,525
to send Ling Yizhou a message through me?

352
00:33:27,045 --> 00:33:28,845
If you knew,
why did you still give it to him?

353
00:33:28,925 --> 00:33:30,005
Didn't I tell you?

354
00:33:30,845 --> 00:33:32,125
When I've had enough fun,

355
00:33:32,685 --> 00:33:33,885
I'll let you see him.

356
00:33:35,045 --> 00:33:37,605
Now, as the director,
it's time for me to take a bow.

357
00:33:41,445 --> 00:33:42,405
He's almost here.

358
00:33:43,125 --> 00:33:45,725
Aren't you worried
he'll bring the police with him?

359
00:33:46,285 --> 00:33:50,245
The police?
They're probably stuck in traffic.

360
00:33:50,845 --> 00:33:53,965
You know how terrible
the traffic in Gangdong is.

361
00:33:55,445 --> 00:33:56,525
You set it up.

362
00:33:57,805 --> 00:33:59,685
I just didn't want
to be disturbed by nobodies.

363
00:34:01,525 --> 00:34:02,845
I still don't understand.

364
00:34:02,925 --> 00:34:04,765
Why did you do all of this?

365
00:34:05,765 --> 00:34:07,085
No rush.

366
00:34:07,845 --> 00:34:09,325
You'll understand in a moment.

367
00:34:10,605 --> 00:34:11,445
Nan Jintian!

368
00:34:14,125 --> 00:34:15,805
That was faster than I expected.

369
00:34:17,005 --> 00:34:18,204
Weren't you waiting for me?

370
00:34:18,965 --> 00:34:21,644
Ling Yizhou, leave.
This is a trap. Just leave me!

371
00:34:21,965 --> 00:34:24,525
Mumu, don't worry. I'll bring you home.

372
00:34:27,565 --> 00:34:28,845
Did I tell you to move?

373
00:34:29,164 --> 00:34:30,285
I told you to come here.

374
00:34:31,164 --> 00:34:33,244
But I didn't say
you could take her with you.

375
00:34:34,885 --> 00:34:36,005
I'm here already.

376
00:34:36,285 --> 00:34:37,925
I won't leave without her.

377
00:34:38,445 --> 00:34:42,885
Ling Yizhou...
I'm the one who calls the shots here.

378
00:34:44,085 --> 00:34:46,485
You're just a mouse,
being played around with by the cat.

379
00:34:47,005 --> 00:34:50,445
I'm really impressed by
the suicidal recklessness you possess.

380
00:34:51,005 --> 00:34:51,885
I think that...

381
00:34:52,885 --> 00:34:55,684
you're more like the rat
everyone hates right now.

382
00:34:56,005 --> 00:34:57,125
Ling Yizhou!

383
00:34:58,684 --> 00:35:01,204
Are you trying to provoke me?
With a gun in my hand?

384
00:35:01,885 --> 00:35:03,485
Aren't you worried my finger will twitch?

385
00:35:06,925 --> 00:35:10,485
Yang Tong, help me record all this.

386
00:35:11,085 --> 00:35:12,005
I promised you

387
00:35:12,885 --> 00:35:14,725
that we were going to send
a gift to our mother.

388
00:35:16,645 --> 00:35:17,485
Nan Jintian,

389
00:35:18,245 --> 00:35:20,005
if you're trying to avenge your mother,

390
00:35:20,805 --> 00:35:23,125
you should take it out on the person
who ruined your family.

391
00:35:23,565 --> 00:35:26,005
If you think that I should pay
for my mother's actions,

392
00:35:26,765 --> 00:35:27,765
then come at me.

393
00:35:28,125 --> 00:35:29,605
Leave Mumu alone. She's innocent.

394
00:35:30,205 --> 00:35:31,925
How do you know I didn't avenge her?

395
00:35:32,285 --> 00:35:34,125
If that woman hadn't brainwashed my dad...

396
00:35:35,325 --> 00:35:37,405
would I have no home to return to?

397
00:35:38,085 --> 00:35:38,925
So...

398
00:35:40,805 --> 00:35:43,805
you came to hurt me
because you couldn't hurt her.

399
00:35:45,565 --> 00:35:47,805
Now I know how powerless you are.

400
00:35:48,165 --> 00:35:49,445
Me? Powerless?

401
00:35:50,565 --> 00:35:53,245
Ling Yizhou, did I hear you correctly?
You're saying I'm powerless?

402
00:35:56,405 --> 00:35:57,485
Ling Yizhou.

403
00:35:58,205 --> 00:36:01,365
You can't even protect your own woman.
And I'm the powerless one?

404
00:36:02,365 --> 00:36:03,845
You have no right to say that.

405
00:36:05,325 --> 00:36:07,205
You're just a tool
I'm using to get revenge.

406
00:36:08,765 --> 00:36:10,485
<i>Over all these years, I've been thinking,</i>

407
00:36:11,165 --> 00:36:13,005
<i>how can I hurt that woman even more?</i>

408
00:36:14,565 --> 00:36:16,645
<i>Then I found out</i>
<i>that she still cares about you.</i>

409
00:36:16,725 --> 00:36:18,725
This is a birthday present
for you, Yizhou.

410
00:36:19,085 --> 00:36:22,205
I didn't get any in the past.
I don't need one now.

411
00:36:24,525 --> 00:36:26,685
<i>She abandoned that child.</i>

412
00:36:27,525 --> 00:36:29,405
<i>But she still cares about him so much.</i>

413
00:36:30,485 --> 00:36:31,565
<i>Which is why your pain</i>

414
00:36:32,605 --> 00:36:33,925
<i>is also her pain.</i>

415
00:36:38,765 --> 00:36:40,485
Then why did you drag Mumu into this?

416
00:36:41,245 --> 00:36:42,925
You should have just come after me.

417
00:36:43,525 --> 00:36:44,605
Because I found out...

418
00:36:45,765 --> 00:36:47,645
that you're just like your mother.

419
00:36:48,765 --> 00:36:50,645
For love, you can sacrifice everything.

420
00:36:52,445 --> 00:36:57,445
But her love for my father...
ruined my life.

421
00:36:59,165 --> 00:37:00,285
So I...

422
00:37:01,325 --> 00:37:02,605
I'm going to ruin your life, too.

423
00:37:06,125 --> 00:37:07,365
No!

424
00:37:14,685 --> 00:37:17,805
Nan Jintian.
Without a gun, you're just a coward.

425
00:37:20,045 --> 00:37:22,005
-Ling Yizhou! Let go!
-Xia Lin. Stay here.

426
00:37:42,125 --> 00:37:44,645
Game over.

427
00:38:25,405 --> 00:38:27,365
Ling Yizhou!

428
00:38:27,445 --> 00:38:29,645
Are you OK? Ling Yizhou!

429
00:38:31,525 --> 00:38:33,405
I'm fine.

430
00:38:36,085 --> 00:38:38,205
No. That's not right.

431
00:38:39,365 --> 00:38:40,645
That's not the ending I wrote.

432
00:38:41,085 --> 00:38:42,485
Why did you change my script?

433
00:38:43,565 --> 00:38:45,885
Xia Lin should be lying in your arms.

434
00:38:46,525 --> 00:38:48,165
You'll suffer your whole life.

435
00:38:48,565 --> 00:38:50,325
And that woman will rot in hell.

436
00:38:50,925 --> 00:38:54,045
You've got your revenge. Let her go.

437
00:38:55,125 --> 00:38:58,085
Fine. If you like changing
my script so much,

438
00:38:58,365 --> 00:39:00,685
let's change it completely then.

439
00:39:01,045 --> 00:39:02,165
You can die together.

440
00:39:04,845 --> 00:39:06,485
As long as my family's together,

441
00:39:07,125 --> 00:39:08,165
I'm not afraid of anything.

442
00:39:10,165 --> 00:39:13,165
Nan Jintian. Do it.

443
00:39:17,685 --> 00:39:18,525
Sure.

444
00:39:22,205 --> 00:39:23,565
Sir, the police are here.

445
00:39:23,645 --> 00:39:24,965
You go. I'll take responsibility.

446
00:39:32,845 --> 00:39:34,765
I'll let your mother know you're dead.

447
00:39:35,645 --> 00:39:37,045
I'll tell her in person.

448
00:39:38,125 --> 00:39:42,525
After that, we'll finally be even.

449
00:39:43,845 --> 00:39:47,005
Goodbye then.

450
00:39:58,645 --> 00:40:01,045
I'm sorry, Xia Lin.

451
00:40:04,285 --> 00:40:05,165
Ling Yizhou.

452
00:40:07,525 --> 00:40:08,445
Mumu.

453
00:40:10,485 --> 00:40:12,405
Promise me you'll carry on with your life.

454
00:40:13,765 --> 00:40:14,685
No.

455
00:40:17,765 --> 00:40:20,405
How can I live without you?

456
00:40:22,325 --> 00:40:23,845
We have a baby now.

457
00:40:25,605 --> 00:40:27,765
You wouldn't want the baby...

458
00:40:28,845 --> 00:40:30,645
to never see his father.

459
00:40:41,605 --> 00:40:47,405
Ling Yizhou! Please don't leave us.

460
00:40:47,485 --> 00:40:49,045
Ling Yizhou...

461
00:40:50,525 --> 00:40:52,565
Wake up.

462
00:40:53,125 --> 00:40:55,485
Wake up.

463
00:40:55,885 --> 00:40:58,245
Ling Yizhou. Wake up.

464
00:43:13,245 --> 00:43:14,085
Pidan...

465
00:43:16,365 --> 00:43:17,965
you miss Mumu, too, right?

466
00:45:01,645 --> 00:45:03,405
Subtitle translation by Sophie Chang

467
00:45:04,125 --> 00:45:04,965
Dr. Wang,

468
00:45:05,885 --> 00:45:07,045
tell me the truth.

469
00:45:07,925 --> 00:45:09,325
Will he wake up?

470
00:45:09,405 --> 00:45:12,325
It's possible, but it would be a miracle.

471
00:45:12,405 --> 00:45:15,205
Lingshi Group shareholders
are calling on the board

472
00:45:15,285 --> 00:45:17,045
to remove Ling Yizhou as CEO.

473
00:45:17,125 --> 00:45:18,365
Those bastards.

474
00:45:18,765 --> 00:45:20,605
They're already trying
to take over the company.

475
00:45:21,085 --> 00:45:22,325
You mean that

476
00:45:22,805 --> 00:45:27,165
someone wants to take over Lingshi
while Ling Yizhou is unconscious?
