1
00:00:13,325 --> 00:00:15,925
This is my house.
I don't want to see you here every day.

2
00:00:16,605 --> 00:00:19,005
I don't want you alone with my husband.

3
00:00:19,365 --> 00:00:21,325
I just want to help you take care of him.

4
00:00:21,405 --> 00:00:22,245
Are you done?

5
00:00:22,525 --> 00:00:23,805
Get out. Close the door for me.

6
00:00:24,205 --> 00:00:26,725
He wasn't super affectionate before,

7
00:00:27,125 --> 00:00:29,485
but at least he wasn't this mean.

8
00:00:30,045 --> 00:00:32,245
This is the normal Ling Yizhou.

9
00:00:32,805 --> 00:00:36,245
The doting Ling Yizhou was abnormal.

10
00:00:36,325 --> 00:00:40,605
You want to use me
to get An Ran away from Ling Yizhou.

11
00:00:41,205 --> 00:00:42,925
It's a win-win solution.
What do you think?

12
00:00:43,845 --> 00:00:47,205
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

13
00:02:13,965 --> 00:02:16,885
EPISODE 10

14
00:02:29,165 --> 00:02:30,525
<i>Hello? Where are you?</i>

15
00:02:34,885 --> 00:02:35,765
I'm at home.

16
00:02:36,885 --> 00:02:39,925
<i>I just watched a romance movie.</i>

17
00:02:41,085 --> 00:02:42,205
You're finished filming?

18
00:02:42,765 --> 00:02:44,445
This sounds like a special relationship.

19
00:02:46,445 --> 00:02:47,525
In the movie,

20
00:02:48,245 --> 00:02:51,925
the couple said three words
to each other before they parted.

21
00:02:52,645 --> 00:02:53,565
Guess what they said.

22
00:02:56,365 --> 00:02:57,605
What do I get if I get it right?

23
00:02:58,885 --> 00:03:00,605
I'll definitely satisfy you, alright?

24
00:03:06,445 --> 00:03:07,285
<i>Mumu.</i>

25
00:03:07,845 --> 00:03:08,685
Just say it.

26
00:03:12,485 --> 00:03:15,885
I love you.

27
00:03:16,885 --> 00:03:17,965
Mission accomplished!

28
00:03:23,765 --> 00:03:25,245
He calls you "Mumu"?

29
00:03:27,885 --> 00:03:28,885
<i>-Director Ling.</i>
<i>-Sir.</i>

30
00:03:30,165 --> 00:03:31,565
Director Ling and Mumu?

31
00:03:32,125 --> 00:03:33,005
From what I know,

32
00:03:33,245 --> 00:03:37,485
Director Ling's Weibo account is called
"Earn Money to Support Mumu."

33
00:03:39,725 --> 00:03:44,285
Is this the same Director Ling I know?

34
00:03:46,445 --> 00:03:47,885
Chu Yan, say something.

35
00:03:48,925 --> 00:03:51,965
Ling doesn't belong to you.
Why should he tell you who he's dating?

36
00:03:53,045 --> 00:03:56,125
OK, let's have a look
at Chu Yan's task card.

37
00:03:58,725 --> 00:03:59,605
Well done, guys.

38
00:04:00,205 --> 00:04:02,365
Alright, everybody,
get ready for the next filming.

39
00:04:08,845 --> 00:04:10,045
Shuangshuang...

40
00:04:11,685 --> 00:04:14,005
I didn't mean to hide it from you.

41
00:04:14,605 --> 00:04:15,725
I'm sorry.

42
00:04:16,125 --> 00:04:17,565
When did you meet each other?

43
00:04:18,045 --> 00:04:21,045
At the Celebrity Jog?
The red carpet event? Or even earlier?

44
00:04:22,445 --> 00:04:23,844
Even earlier.

45
00:04:24,045 --> 00:04:25,084
I'm sorry.

46
00:04:25,685 --> 00:04:27,485
Because of personal reasons,

47
00:04:27,805 --> 00:04:30,965
we couldn't reveal our relationship.

48
00:04:31,445 --> 00:04:32,765
I've really misjudged you.

49
00:04:33,405 --> 00:04:36,245
So, Director Ling bought out
the entire clothing line...

50
00:04:37,285 --> 00:04:39,685
just so he could buy you a new dress?

51
00:04:40,565 --> 00:04:43,445
So, the real reason <i>Frosty Moon</i>
was cancelled and Lu Di was blacklisted

52
00:04:44,285 --> 00:04:45,245
is all because of you?

53
00:04:46,005 --> 00:04:48,805
He was blacklisted?
I didn't know about that.

54
00:04:49,285 --> 00:04:50,485
Stop bragging in front of me.

55
00:04:51,045 --> 00:04:52,165
A man like Ling Yizhou

56
00:04:52,685 --> 00:04:54,605
will treat you like
a delicate treasure today...

57
00:04:55,645 --> 00:04:58,045
and shift his affection
onto another woman tomorrow.

58
00:04:58,925 --> 00:05:00,365
You have nothing to be proud of.

59
00:05:01,845 --> 00:05:03,645
Thank you for your reminder,
Ms. Shuangshuang.

60
00:05:04,285 --> 00:05:06,925
But I am 100% sure about one thing.

61
00:05:07,405 --> 00:05:09,285
Those whom he had no interest in
in the past

62
00:05:09,925 --> 00:05:11,285
won't win him over in the future.

63
00:05:11,765 --> 00:05:12,605
Whatever.

64
00:05:13,685 --> 00:05:15,685
Although I can't believe I lost to you,

65
00:05:16,645 --> 00:05:18,205
I have no interest in being an intruder.

66
00:05:24,805 --> 00:05:26,085
Mr. Ling is so awesome.

67
00:05:26,445 --> 00:05:27,885
He did so much for you,

68
00:05:27,965 --> 00:05:29,205
yet chose to keep it secret.

69
00:05:29,285 --> 00:05:30,125
Thumbs up for him.

70
00:05:30,765 --> 00:05:32,245
Typical Ling Yizhou.

71
00:05:32,605 --> 00:05:34,725
He always makes decisions

72
00:05:35,205 --> 00:05:36,845
without asking me.

73
00:05:38,245 --> 00:05:40,525
I'm sure he just didn't want you to worry.

74
00:05:41,005 --> 00:05:42,045
Alright, let's go.

75
00:05:49,725 --> 00:05:50,885
Hi, Lisa.

76
00:05:50,965 --> 00:05:53,925
It's company policy to report your
love relationship, don't you know that?

77
00:05:54,365 --> 00:05:56,565
What's more,
this person happens to be Ling Yizhou.

78
00:05:56,845 --> 00:05:59,685
How can you hide
such an important matter from me?

79
00:06:00,005 --> 00:06:03,925
I just wanted to wait until things
were more stable between us.

80
00:06:07,205 --> 00:06:09,485
Director Xu, how are you?

81
00:06:10,205 --> 00:06:12,245
-A product launch?
<i>-She ruined Ling Yizhou's life.</i>

82
00:06:12,325 --> 00:06:14,885
<i>Xia Lin, how dare you use Mr. Ling</i>
<i>to gain popularity?</i>

83
00:06:14,965 --> 00:06:16,165
<i>She's a gold digger.</i>

84
00:06:16,245 --> 00:06:18,405
Chu Yan and Shuangshuang
will both be there.

85
00:06:18,805 --> 00:06:21,645
<i>Starting today,</i>
<i>you're sleeping in the guest bedroom.</i>

86
00:06:22,485 --> 00:06:23,725
YOU'RE IN THE GUEST BEDROOM

87
00:06:23,805 --> 00:06:24,725
OK.

88
00:06:26,725 --> 00:06:27,965
Go home and pack your stuff.

89
00:06:28,525 --> 00:06:30,645
We're flying to Beijing tomorrow
for a brand launch.

90
00:06:31,045 --> 00:06:32,325
Really? I can go, too?

91
00:06:33,485 --> 00:06:35,245
You'll be able to see lots of celebrities!

92
00:06:36,125 --> 00:06:37,405
What's so exciting about that?

93
00:06:37,485 --> 00:06:40,405
Don't you know how many
important resources you're holding now?

94
00:06:40,685 --> 00:06:43,445
One word from Mr. Ling,
and you'd have everything at your feet.

95
00:06:43,525 --> 00:06:45,565
The entire industry
would follow your every order.

96
00:06:45,645 --> 00:06:47,485
Not to mention a mere brand launch event.

97
00:06:47,805 --> 00:06:50,045
I'm already being blacklisted
for dating him.

98
00:06:50,125 --> 00:06:52,285
If I rely on him for more,
I'll be blacklisted forever.

99
00:06:52,845 --> 00:06:54,845
Let's go. I'm starving already.

100
00:06:58,165 --> 00:07:00,925
LING YIZHOU AND XIA LIN,
THE PERFECT MATCH!

101
00:07:11,405 --> 00:07:12,645
You're giving up?

102
00:07:13,005 --> 00:07:15,325
Get lost! I don't want to speak to anyone.

103
00:07:17,925 --> 00:07:20,805
You're letting Xia Lin have Ling Yizhou?

104
00:07:23,885 --> 00:07:26,445
Don't you dare think
I don't know about your intentions.

105
00:07:26,525 --> 00:07:28,365
You want to use me
to fulfill your own purpose.

106
00:07:29,765 --> 00:07:30,605
Use you?

107
00:07:31,405 --> 00:07:32,325
You're wrong.

108
00:07:33,005 --> 00:07:34,285
We're using each other.

109
00:07:36,565 --> 00:07:38,685
I don't understand
what you're talking about.

110
00:07:40,605 --> 00:07:42,445
We worked well together
on the car accident.

111
00:07:43,365 --> 00:07:45,245
You didn't seize
your opportunity well enough.

112
00:07:46,045 --> 00:07:47,765
That's why the outcome didn't go your way.

113
00:07:49,965 --> 00:07:51,485
What exactly are you trying to say?

114
00:07:55,405 --> 00:07:57,045
I uncovered a secret.

115
00:08:14,365 --> 00:08:16,005
There's a hidden safe here?

116
00:08:24,725 --> 00:08:25,805
The PIN number is 0608.

117
00:08:26,325 --> 00:08:28,005
You're too kind.

118
00:08:28,405 --> 00:08:29,645
The PIN is my birthday?

119
00:08:29,885 --> 00:08:30,965
It's my birthday.

120
00:08:42,804 --> 00:08:44,605
I didn't even hear you. You scared me!

121
00:08:44,684 --> 00:08:45,684
What are you doing?

122
00:08:46,044 --> 00:08:48,485
I found a safe at home and got curious.

123
00:08:51,685 --> 00:08:52,525
Why are you uptight?

124
00:08:53,325 --> 00:08:56,805
Are your shameful secrets hidden in there?

125
00:08:57,725 --> 00:08:58,565
Yes.

126
00:08:59,525 --> 00:09:01,845
I hid a lot of confidential
business information.

127
00:09:02,325 --> 00:09:05,445
If the information is exposed, Mrs. Ling
won't be able to live this life anymore.

128
00:09:06,125 --> 00:09:07,765
You think I care about the title?

129
00:09:07,845 --> 00:09:10,205
You're not welcome here.
Go to the living room.

130
00:09:10,605 --> 00:09:11,645
This is domestic violence.

131
00:09:12,565 --> 00:09:16,845
You should have known this was coming
the moment you revealed your identity.

132
00:09:21,365 --> 00:09:22,765
I helped you accomplish your task,

133
00:09:23,205 --> 00:09:25,165
and you're blaming me for a tiny accident?

134
00:09:25,245 --> 00:09:27,045
Burning the bridge
after crossing the river.

135
00:09:28,125 --> 00:09:29,205
Why are you packing this?

136
00:09:30,645 --> 00:09:33,285
I'm going to a product launch tomorrow.
I'll stay the night.

137
00:09:33,365 --> 00:09:34,485
Why didn't you tell me?

138
00:09:35,645 --> 00:09:37,925
They just told me yesterday.

139
00:09:40,365 --> 00:09:42,005
What if I had told you earlier?

140
00:09:43,485 --> 00:09:45,325
I just worry that you're working too hard.

141
00:09:45,405 --> 00:09:47,045
We just made our relationship public.

142
00:09:47,125 --> 00:09:50,405
If you want to act,
I can help you... arrange things.

143
00:09:51,125 --> 00:09:54,805
Please don't.
I thought we had an agreement.

144
00:09:55,045 --> 00:09:56,645
You can't interfere with my work.

145
00:09:59,405 --> 00:10:01,805
Alright. I'll do as my wife says.

146
00:10:03,845 --> 00:10:05,125
By the way,

147
00:10:05,205 --> 00:10:07,325
was production of <i>Frosty Moon</i> cancelled

148
00:10:07,845 --> 00:10:10,405
and Lu Di blacklisted because of you?

149
00:10:10,725 --> 00:10:12,125
What do you think? Of course it was.

150
00:10:12,205 --> 00:10:14,605
He hit on my woman.
Of course he had to pay.

151
00:10:15,965 --> 00:10:17,725
So, when you called me
before the accident,

152
00:10:17,805 --> 00:10:18,805
it was about this?

153
00:10:23,325 --> 00:10:26,325
Besides this, is there anything else
you're hiding from me?

154
00:10:27,485 --> 00:10:29,605
-Nope.
-That had better be the case.

155
00:10:30,165 --> 00:10:31,165
If there is,

156
00:10:31,565 --> 00:10:33,085
you had better never let me find out.

157
00:10:33,845 --> 00:10:35,205
Alright. Let's not talk about this.

158
00:10:35,925 --> 00:10:37,125
I have something to tell you.

159
00:10:38,405 --> 00:10:40,205
Our fish tank talked to me just now.

160
00:10:41,245 --> 00:10:42,445
It wants to tell me a secret.

161
00:10:43,125 --> 00:10:44,845
But it will only tell me in your presence.

162
00:10:45,725 --> 00:10:46,765
Should we go check it out?

163
00:10:47,085 --> 00:10:49,045
-I haven't finished packing.
-Come on.

164
00:10:51,085 --> 00:10:51,925
Wenwen.

165
00:10:54,045 --> 00:10:55,205
Wenwen.

166
00:10:56,365 --> 00:10:57,365
Wen Li.

167
00:11:02,205 --> 00:11:03,165
What is it?

168
00:11:03,485 --> 00:11:05,085
My period is here.

169
00:11:06,085 --> 00:11:07,965
Can you make a run
to the convenience store?

170
00:11:09,525 --> 00:11:12,365
I need extra-long pads, 16.5 inches.

171
00:11:15,205 --> 00:11:16,325
How could a girl like you

172
00:11:16,725 --> 00:11:18,125
joke about such things?

173
00:11:18,445 --> 00:11:20,205
I'm not joking with you.

174
00:11:20,525 --> 00:11:22,565
My legs are going numb.
I've been squatting too long.

175
00:11:23,725 --> 00:11:24,765
Hurry and come out then.

176
00:11:27,405 --> 00:11:30,325
If you don't get the pads for me,
I'll call Linlin instead.

177
00:11:31,245 --> 00:11:32,925
It's getting late.

178
00:11:33,605 --> 00:11:36,325
What if it bothers Director Ling?

179
00:11:36,565 --> 00:11:37,605
I'm not sure...

180
00:11:40,365 --> 00:11:42,205
I'll go get them. Wait here.

181
00:11:44,725 --> 00:11:46,445
I wouldn't be joking about this, OK?

182
00:11:47,645 --> 00:11:48,525
Oh, my God.

183
00:11:56,285 --> 00:11:57,685
I'll leave them by the door.

184
00:11:58,045 --> 00:11:58,885
OK.

185
00:12:15,365 --> 00:12:17,605
Jia Fei.

186
00:12:22,205 --> 00:12:23,165
Jia Fei!

187
00:12:24,085 --> 00:12:24,965
Jia Fei!

188
00:12:31,925 --> 00:12:33,085
<i>Hello, emergency room.</i>

189
00:12:33,165 --> 00:12:34,125
Hello.

190
00:12:34,205 --> 00:12:36,125
I have a patient here
in shock due to pain.

191
00:12:36,645 --> 00:12:38,485
What can I do to help?

192
00:12:39,205 --> 00:12:41,365
<i>Where is the patient feeling pain?</i>

193
00:12:45,725 --> 00:12:46,565
Her abdomen.

194
00:12:47,845 --> 00:12:49,885
<i>Does she have a past history</i>
<i>of such illness?</i>

195
00:12:52,725 --> 00:12:53,925
I think it's menstrual cramps.

196
00:12:54,605 --> 00:12:55,645
<i>Sir,</i>

197
00:12:55,725 --> 00:12:57,805
<i>menstrual cramps are quite common.</i>

198
00:12:57,885 --> 00:13:00,645
<i>You shouldn't call the ER even if</i>
<i>you're worried about your girlfriend.</i>

199
00:13:04,005 --> 00:13:05,485
Are you stupid?

200
00:13:07,245 --> 00:13:08,405
Have some brown sugar water.

201
00:13:10,245 --> 00:13:11,085
Here.

202
00:13:12,725 --> 00:13:13,565
Slowly.

203
00:13:15,845 --> 00:13:16,685
Have another sip.

204
00:13:33,285 --> 00:13:37,605
They say music can help alleviate pain.
I'll play a song for you.

205
00:13:38,005 --> 00:13:38,845
Sure.

206
00:13:45,925 --> 00:13:47,165
ENDLESS MUSIC

207
00:13:53,765 --> 00:13:57,605
I'm already feeling very agitated.

208
00:13:57,885 --> 00:14:00,885
There are so many songs on KuGou,
must you play rock?

209
00:14:01,885 --> 00:14:03,365
I'll play something more relaxing.

210
00:14:07,845 --> 00:14:10,685
I'll soften the music
with the surround sound effect.

211
00:14:19,365 --> 00:14:20,565
REAR LEFT SURROUND SOUND BOX

212
00:14:51,845 --> 00:14:55,885
<i>You're actually pretty good</i>
<i>at taking care of people.</i>

213
00:15:05,805 --> 00:15:06,645
Jia Fei?

214
00:15:07,045 --> 00:15:08,205
Wake up.

215
00:15:08,685 --> 00:15:09,845
Jia Fei.

216
00:15:10,885 --> 00:15:14,245
I'm not dead. Why did you slap me?

217
00:15:15,085 --> 00:15:16,045
How are you feeling?

218
00:15:17,045 --> 00:15:17,885
I'm fine now.

219
00:15:18,845 --> 00:15:20,085
Get some rest then.

220
00:15:25,165 --> 00:15:26,005
Close the door.

221
00:15:31,285 --> 00:15:34,565
I've written all kinds of scripts before.

222
00:15:35,245 --> 00:15:37,845
Why would I be touched
by a cup of brown sugar water?

223
00:15:47,405 --> 00:15:50,285
Linlin, let's get some hot pot today.

224
00:15:50,605 --> 00:15:53,845
<i>I'm flying to Beijing for an event.</i>
<i>I won't be able to join you.</i>

225
00:15:53,925 --> 00:15:55,405
-An event?
-Yes.

226
00:15:58,805 --> 00:16:00,725
Don't join me then. I'll come with you.

227
00:16:08,965 --> 00:16:10,685
A pair of fives. I win again!

228
00:16:11,925 --> 00:16:12,765
Pass.

229
00:16:13,885 --> 00:16:14,725
Pair of eights.

230
00:16:16,645 --> 00:16:17,485
Pass.

231
00:16:19,525 --> 00:16:20,405
Pass.

232
00:16:23,445 --> 00:16:24,285
One Ace.

233
00:16:24,605 --> 00:16:25,445
Pass.

234
00:16:25,765 --> 00:16:26,605
Two!

235
00:16:29,205 --> 00:16:30,085
Yeah!

236
00:16:30,365 --> 00:16:31,645
Why did you play a single card

237
00:16:31,725 --> 00:16:33,365
when she only had one left?

238
00:16:33,885 --> 00:16:36,525
I don't have laser eyes.
How would I know that?

239
00:16:37,245 --> 00:16:39,005
She was holding one card. It's obvious!

240
00:16:39,325 --> 00:16:41,325
Why didn't you tell me
before I played it then?

241
00:16:42,205 --> 00:16:43,685
That's enough, guys.

242
00:16:43,765 --> 00:16:47,125
It's just a beer.
We're not betting houses or land.

243
00:16:47,405 --> 00:16:49,165
Aren't you the best at drinking?

244
00:16:50,045 --> 00:16:51,405
I don't want to play anymore.

245
00:16:54,005 --> 00:16:56,485
Chu Yan. You have a pair of tens
and four Kings.

246
00:16:56,565 --> 00:16:57,765
Why didn't you separate them?

247
00:16:58,525 --> 00:17:00,285
I was so mad at her that I forgot.

248
00:17:01,445 --> 00:17:03,445
Did you lose on purpose?

249
00:17:04,125 --> 00:17:05,525
Why would I do that?

250
00:17:06,325 --> 00:17:07,685
Next round!

251
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:21,965
SUPPORT MUMU:
DOES MY SON LOOK LIKE ME?

252
00:17:28,925 --> 00:17:29,765
Hey.

253
00:17:30,725 --> 00:17:32,805
Postpone my Beijing meeting
to the day after tomorrow.

254
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:34,645
Then book me a ticket for tomorrow night.

255
00:17:35,245 --> 00:17:37,285
<i>Mrs. Ling will be thrilled to see you.</i>

256
00:17:37,965 --> 00:17:39,205
It's a business trip.

257
00:17:39,645 --> 00:17:41,565
<i>Of course.</i>
<i>You're just dropping by to visit her.</i>

258
00:17:53,445 --> 00:17:55,325
AUDIO LIBRARY

259
00:18:03,565 --> 00:18:04,525
Miss Xia!

260
00:18:04,605 --> 00:18:05,605
Tell us what's going on.

261
00:18:05,685 --> 00:18:07,405
How long have you been together?

262
00:18:07,485 --> 00:18:09,165
Can you share your love story with us?

263
00:18:09,245 --> 00:18:11,605
Aren't you all here
for the product launch event?

264
00:18:11,965 --> 00:18:15,245
Maybe you should be more concerned
about the product instead of gossip.

265
00:18:16,125 --> 00:18:18,125
How about this?
I'm currently working on a new film.

266
00:18:18,405 --> 00:18:20,285
If you'd like to hear more about it,
follow me.

267
00:18:21,405 --> 00:18:23,005
Is it still in the filming process?

268
00:18:23,365 --> 00:18:25,005
We're ready to wrap things up.

269
00:18:25,725 --> 00:18:27,365
There are others that are more suitable.

270
00:18:27,765 --> 00:18:29,245
No way. You deserve it.

271
00:18:29,325 --> 00:18:30,325
Cheers to you.

272
00:18:41,845 --> 00:18:42,685
Xia Lin.

273
00:18:45,645 --> 00:18:48,165
It's you.
I thought I got the wrong person.

274
00:18:48,405 --> 00:18:49,725
Nan? What a coincidence!

275
00:18:49,925 --> 00:18:51,325
What are you doing here?

276
00:18:51,405 --> 00:18:52,805
Our company received an invitation.

277
00:18:52,885 --> 00:18:54,205
I'm here to make up the numbers.

278
00:18:56,445 --> 00:18:57,325
You look beautiful.

279
00:18:59,445 --> 00:19:00,325
Thank you.

280
00:19:01,405 --> 00:19:03,405
Why are you alone?

281
00:19:04,325 --> 00:19:07,085
It's my first time at this kind of event.
I'm not quite used to it.

282
00:19:07,405 --> 00:19:08,885
Thankfully, I ran into you.

283
00:19:10,365 --> 00:19:13,405
To be honest, I'm also trying
to get away from people.

284
00:19:18,245 --> 00:19:19,085
Miss Xia.

285
00:19:21,085 --> 00:19:23,245
You should talk. I'll go walk around.

286
00:19:25,645 --> 00:19:26,845
Allow me to introduce you.

287
00:19:27,365 --> 00:19:29,805
This is Director Jiang
of MeiLai Greater China.

288
00:19:30,605 --> 00:19:31,605
Nice to meet you.

289
00:19:31,685 --> 00:19:34,045
Chu Yan, what have you been up to lately?

290
00:19:34,125 --> 00:19:36,205
I'm sorry. Please excuse me.

291
00:19:36,285 --> 00:19:37,125
Alright.

292
00:19:38,325 --> 00:19:40,165
Thank you for your compliments,
Director Jiang.

293
00:19:40,245 --> 00:19:42,245
Yizhou never compliments me on my looks.

294
00:19:42,725 --> 00:19:44,085
He doesn't care about such things.

295
00:19:44,605 --> 00:19:46,125
I've met Director Ling a few times,

296
00:19:46,565 --> 00:19:48,925
but I've never had the chance
to chat with him.

297
00:19:50,085 --> 00:19:51,205
I'll fix that.

298
00:19:51,285 --> 00:19:52,405
Come visit me next time.

299
00:19:52,485 --> 00:19:55,285
Would Miss Xia and Director Ling
do us the honor of joining us?

300
00:19:56,245 --> 00:19:58,085
I'm sorry, I...

301
00:19:58,165 --> 00:19:59,645
There you are.

302
00:20:01,525 --> 00:20:02,445
Mr. Chu is here, too.

303
00:20:03,765 --> 00:20:04,925
I have to be here.

304
00:20:05,365 --> 00:20:06,445
Ling instructed me

305
00:20:06,765 --> 00:20:10,085
to stay close to his girlfriend.

306
00:20:10,405 --> 00:20:11,845
In case she gets bullied by others.

307
00:20:12,805 --> 00:20:16,925
Miss Xia has Mr. Chu and Director Ling
watching her back.

308
00:20:17,525 --> 00:20:18,885
No need to worry.

309
00:20:19,925 --> 00:20:23,885
I'd like to ask Miss Xia to be
spokesperson for our company.

310
00:20:23,965 --> 00:20:25,485
Would you be interested, Miss Xia?

311
00:20:27,605 --> 00:20:29,165
Thank you for offering, Director Jiang.

312
00:20:29,805 --> 00:20:33,245
But I don't think I'm qualified enough
for such an important job yet.

313
00:20:33,325 --> 00:20:35,805
When I am ready,

314
00:20:36,045 --> 00:20:38,365
I hope Director Jiang
will give me the opportunity.

315
00:20:38,445 --> 00:20:39,925
As long as Miss Xia is willing,

316
00:20:40,005 --> 00:20:41,085
my door is always open.

317
00:20:41,165 --> 00:20:44,685
I'll show her around now.
Please excuse us.

318
00:20:46,125 --> 00:20:48,565
It was nice meeting you both,
Director Xu and Director Jiang.

319
00:20:48,645 --> 00:20:49,645
You too.

320
00:20:55,565 --> 00:20:57,445
I've underestimated you.

321
00:20:58,045 --> 00:21:00,005
Who was that man
chatting with you just now?

322
00:21:00,525 --> 00:21:02,685
Why should I tell you?
How is this your business?

323
00:21:03,325 --> 00:21:04,605
How is it my business?

324
00:21:06,085 --> 00:21:07,925
It doesn't have much to do with me,

325
00:21:08,005 --> 00:21:10,885
but it definitely has a lot to do
with someone in my contacts.

326
00:21:10,965 --> 00:21:13,445
Someone called Ling Yizhou.

327
00:21:16,045 --> 00:21:17,085
What's going on?

328
00:21:18,765 --> 00:21:21,645
I suddenly can't breathe.

329
00:21:22,165 --> 00:21:25,885
Just hearing his name makes you dizzy?

330
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:28,125
Let me snap some photos
and send them to him.

331
00:21:28,205 --> 00:21:30,245
Stop fooling around.
I'm really not feeling well.

332
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:34,005
Are you serious?

333
00:21:34,885 --> 00:21:36,245
Should I take you to the hospital?

334
00:21:36,325 --> 00:21:39,245
No. I probably haven't been
getting enough rest.

335
00:21:39,565 --> 00:21:42,445
I'm tired from the event.
I'll be fine after I get some rest.

336
00:21:43,205 --> 00:21:44,285
Let me escort you back.

337
00:21:45,045 --> 00:21:47,645
By the way,
don't mention a word to Ling Yizhou.

338
00:21:48,125 --> 00:21:49,965
Don't worry. Do I look like a snitch?

339
00:21:52,925 --> 00:21:56,525
If reporters get a photo of us,
we'll be in the gossip column again.

340
00:21:57,285 --> 00:21:58,685
Why are you so dumb?

341
00:21:58,765 --> 00:22:00,325
You keep getting hurt again and again.

342
00:22:00,405 --> 00:22:01,565
Why do you love to nag?

343
00:22:01,645 --> 00:22:02,765
You think I like to nag?

344
00:22:03,205 --> 00:22:04,045
What if...

345
00:22:09,485 --> 00:22:11,365
I was very ill before.

346
00:22:11,445 --> 00:22:14,125
He's not just my legal husband.
He saved my life.

347
00:22:30,525 --> 00:22:31,365
Xia Lin?

348
00:22:41,085 --> 00:22:42,365
Long time no see.

349
00:22:48,125 --> 00:22:49,205
Why are you here?

350
00:22:49,965 --> 00:22:54,285
Why are you being so cold
towards an old neighbor?

351
00:22:55,445 --> 00:22:56,685
I don't want to talk to you.

352
00:22:58,085 --> 00:22:59,725
Aren't you curious about when I got back?

353
00:22:59,805 --> 00:23:00,725
Not at all.

354
00:23:01,165 --> 00:23:03,165
You must be here for your girlfriend.

355
00:23:10,445 --> 00:23:11,445
What are you implying?

356
00:23:12,365 --> 00:23:14,085
I just want to inform you out of goodwill.

357
00:23:14,845 --> 00:23:16,085
I saw Chu Yan

358
00:23:16,565 --> 00:23:19,605
and your girlfriend
walk into a hotel room.

359
00:23:36,765 --> 00:23:37,605
You're awake?

360
00:23:38,405 --> 00:23:40,125
Sit down. I'll get you a glass of water.

361
00:23:40,365 --> 00:23:41,205
Sure.

362
00:23:50,765 --> 00:23:52,725
Ling, you're finally here.

363
00:23:53,765 --> 00:23:55,565
I don't have to take care
of your wife anymore.

364
00:23:56,885 --> 00:23:58,005
What's going on, Mumu?

365
00:23:58,085 --> 00:23:59,565
She's not feeling--

366
00:23:59,645 --> 00:24:00,965
I missed you so much, Yizhou.

367
00:24:06,725 --> 00:24:08,685
Alright. You carry on then.

368
00:24:09,245 --> 00:24:10,085
I'll get going.

369
00:24:25,325 --> 00:24:27,285
Miss Jia. I've been waiting for you.

370
00:24:27,765 --> 00:24:29,165
Why were you waiting for me?

371
00:24:30,005 --> 00:24:32,485
My boss is here.
Please don't disturb them.

372
00:24:33,645 --> 00:24:35,405
That's nice of you.

373
00:24:36,445 --> 00:24:37,285
What do you mean?

374
00:24:39,005 --> 00:24:40,885
Your attitude towards your boss.

375
00:24:42,285 --> 00:24:44,245
Never mind.

376
00:24:49,605 --> 00:24:50,685
What about my boss?

377
00:24:51,325 --> 00:24:52,445
I bought too much supper.

378
00:24:53,125 --> 00:24:53,965
Want to share?

379
00:25:07,565 --> 00:25:08,405
Yizhou.

380
00:25:15,645 --> 00:25:16,485
Hubby.

381
00:25:17,085 --> 00:25:18,285
Why are you ignoring me?

382
00:25:22,285 --> 00:25:25,605
You're being too nice to me.
Usually that means something's wrong.

383
00:25:30,845 --> 00:25:32,165
When I finish my work here,

384
00:25:33,045 --> 00:25:35,045
can I stay for a few more days?

385
00:25:35,725 --> 00:25:38,285
Have you forgotten
you have a family to attend to now?

386
00:25:39,285 --> 00:25:40,765
You are my family.

387
00:25:41,565 --> 00:25:45,045
Dear Mr. Ling, would you have time
to take me on a date?

388
00:25:51,125 --> 00:25:52,045
Time isn't the problem.

389
00:25:52,805 --> 00:25:54,405
It's your sincerity that matters.

390
00:25:56,605 --> 00:25:58,205
If you won't promise me, don't touch me.

391
00:26:01,365 --> 00:26:02,725
Fine. I promise.

392
00:26:05,205 --> 00:26:07,685
Go take a shower.

393
00:26:11,605 --> 00:26:12,525
Wait here.

394
00:26:26,725 --> 00:26:27,845
What's wrong with me?

395
00:26:29,605 --> 00:26:30,445
It can't be...

396
00:26:31,565 --> 00:26:33,765
Is there something wrong with my heart?

397
00:26:35,725 --> 00:26:36,725
It can't be.

398
00:27:14,925 --> 00:27:17,045
DATE PLAN

399
00:27:26,645 --> 00:27:28,685
<i>Cancel my meeting tomorrow.</i>

400
00:27:48,405 --> 00:27:50,885
Don't move. Mine.

401
00:28:15,845 --> 00:28:17,565
Why are you touching my hair?

402
00:28:21,005 --> 00:28:21,965
Why are you holding me?

403
00:28:25,845 --> 00:28:27,645
I fell asleep. How would I know?

404
00:28:27,885 --> 00:28:29,405
Why are you on my bed?

405
00:28:30,645 --> 00:28:32,605
You're the one who invited me in.

406
00:28:49,765 --> 00:28:50,925
What do you think of this?

407
00:28:52,005 --> 00:28:53,045
Are you buying it for me?

408
00:28:53,845 --> 00:28:56,405
We are on a date, not in a meeting.

409
00:28:56,765 --> 00:28:59,205
You're always in a suit.
I look like your secretary.

410
00:29:00,925 --> 00:29:04,045
Mumu, this shirt doesn't suit me.
It's for children.

411
00:29:05,005 --> 00:29:06,765
It will suit you as long as it fits.

412
00:29:07,325 --> 00:29:09,365
Besides, you lack youthful spirit.

413
00:29:10,165 --> 00:29:11,005
Go, try it on.

414
00:29:11,085 --> 00:29:13,485
Go now.

415
00:29:39,685 --> 00:29:41,845
Hey you, do you have a girlfriend?

416
00:29:42,485 --> 00:29:43,605
Can we be friends on WeChat?

417
00:29:44,565 --> 00:29:46,085
I'm sorry, miss.

418
00:29:47,245 --> 00:29:48,925
I already have a wife.

419
00:29:51,885 --> 00:29:54,165
Why are you being so nice today?

420
00:29:54,245 --> 00:29:55,405
When am I not nice?

421
00:29:56,205 --> 00:29:59,325
You're buying me stuff when you're
out shopping. I feel very touched.

422
00:30:01,965 --> 00:30:04,285
Bend your head
so I can remove the price tag.

423
00:30:07,965 --> 00:30:08,805
What are you doing?

424
00:30:08,885 --> 00:30:11,725
Put me down. We're in a changing room.
We'll get in trouble.

425
00:30:11,805 --> 00:30:12,845
What kind of trouble?

426
00:30:13,125 --> 00:30:15,885
Didn't you want to remove my tag?
I'll put you down when you're done.

427
00:31:20,685 --> 00:31:22,685
When I dropped Feifei off
at the airport yesterday,

428
00:31:22,765 --> 00:31:24,525
she seemed to have something on her mind.

429
00:31:25,005 --> 00:31:28,245
She always boasts that nothing
gets to her. What could it be?

430
00:31:29,365 --> 00:31:30,965
Maybe I'm being too sensitive.

431
00:31:35,245 --> 00:31:36,925
What's wrong? Are you not feeling well?

432
00:31:37,005 --> 00:31:40,565
My chest has been feeling tight lately.
I often can't breathe.

433
00:31:42,365 --> 00:31:44,925
Once we're back home,
let's get you scheduled for a checkup.

434
00:31:46,125 --> 00:31:47,005
By the way,

435
00:31:47,085 --> 00:31:49,045
don't tell Mr. Ling about this.

436
00:31:49,125 --> 00:31:50,765
He'll make a mountain out of a molehill.

437
00:31:50,845 --> 00:31:51,685
Got it.

438
00:31:52,885 --> 00:31:54,965
But before I left,

439
00:31:55,405 --> 00:31:58,525
Mr. Ling was mad about something.

440
00:31:58,805 --> 00:32:02,125
That's nothing compared to being
seen together by the reporters.

441
00:32:02,405 --> 00:32:03,405
You're right. Let's hurry.

442
00:32:04,205 --> 00:32:06,965
Miss Xia, we heard Director Ling
rescheduled his plans to come see you.

443
00:32:07,045 --> 00:32:08,325
Make way.

444
00:32:09,285 --> 00:32:10,205
Please, let us through.

445
00:32:11,485 --> 00:32:12,325
Miss Xia.

446
00:32:12,605 --> 00:32:15,285
Miss Xia, please comment on the matter.

447
00:32:36,685 --> 00:32:40,525
Could it be a relapse?

448
00:32:42,085 --> 00:32:46,405
Doctor, I've been experiencing
palpitations, chest pain, and fatigue.

449
00:32:46,925 --> 00:32:49,405
Is there something wrong with me?

450
00:32:50,525 --> 00:32:51,605
Don't worry.

451
00:32:51,885 --> 00:32:55,005
Based on your medical report,
you have severe anemia.

452
00:32:55,725 --> 00:32:57,605
Have you had similar symptoms before?

453
00:32:57,925 --> 00:33:00,765
I used to have leukemia.
You were my doctor.

454
00:33:03,005 --> 00:33:04,965
I don't remember
performing surgery on you.

455
00:33:06,125 --> 00:33:09,005
I had my checkup at this hospital.

456
00:33:09,285 --> 00:33:11,685
I was diagnosed and had surgery
at a private hospital.

457
00:33:12,205 --> 00:33:15,805
Bring me your diagnosis and surgery report
so I can have a look.

458
00:33:16,365 --> 00:33:17,205
Sure.

459
00:34:01,325 --> 00:34:02,965
I didn't even hear you. You scared me!

460
00:34:03,205 --> 00:34:04,045
What are you doing?

461
00:34:04,485 --> 00:34:06,845
I found a safe at home and got curious.

462
00:34:46,724 --> 00:34:47,925
Hello?

463
00:34:49,724 --> 00:34:50,565
<i>Hello, Mumu.</i>

464
00:34:59,845 --> 00:35:00,845
Mumu, what's wrong?

465
00:35:03,485 --> 00:35:05,725
GANGDONG MUNICIPAL HOSPITAL
BLOOD TEST REPORT

466
00:35:06,005 --> 00:35:06,845
Hello?

467
00:35:17,245 --> 00:35:18,885
Mumu, say something! Hello?

468
00:35:21,045 --> 00:35:21,885
<i>Hello?</i>

469
00:35:22,325 --> 00:35:23,165
<i>Mumu.</i>

470
00:35:23,765 --> 00:35:24,605
<i>Mumu.</i>

471
00:35:26,085 --> 00:35:27,125
<i>Mumu, talk to me!</i>

472
00:35:40,165 --> 00:35:41,885
BLOOD SAMPLE RESULTS: NORMAL

473
00:35:44,685 --> 00:35:46,765
DIAGNOSIS: ANEMIA

474
00:36:00,285 --> 00:36:02,205
DIAGNOSIS: ANEMIA

475
00:36:26,445 --> 00:36:28,605
Mumu, why is it so dark in here?

476
00:36:29,645 --> 00:36:30,685
It doesn't matter.

477
00:36:39,645 --> 00:36:40,485
Mumu...

478
00:36:41,085 --> 00:36:43,045
This report says
that I don't have leukemia.

479
00:36:44,205 --> 00:36:46,005
Why was it in your safe?

480
00:36:55,565 --> 00:36:56,605
You found everything?

481
00:36:57,445 --> 00:37:01,645
Yes. Things I should have seen,
things I shouldn't have seen,

482
00:37:01,885 --> 00:37:03,365
I found it all.

483
00:37:06,765 --> 00:37:07,605
Mumu.

484
00:37:08,525 --> 00:37:10,245
I'll tell you whatever you want to know.

485
00:37:10,325 --> 00:37:13,045
Please don't let
your imagination run wild, OK?

486
00:37:16,325 --> 00:37:19,005
Start talking. I want to hear the truth.

487
00:37:27,605 --> 00:37:31,085
The private hospital where you got
your diagnosis is owned by our family.

488
00:37:33,405 --> 00:37:35,285
I replaced your original diagnosis report,

489
00:37:35,965 --> 00:37:38,605
and falsified the information
that I was a bone marrow match for you.

490
00:37:41,045 --> 00:37:42,445
I knew you would come look for me.

491
00:37:50,725 --> 00:37:52,765
I know this sounds unreasonable
to you now.

492
00:37:52,845 --> 00:37:55,805
But if I hadn't done so,
we would miss our chance with each other.

493
00:37:56,765 --> 00:37:59,525
So you arranged
this bone marrow donation act

494
00:37:59,605 --> 00:38:01,165
and waited for me to knock on your door?

495
00:38:01,885 --> 00:38:04,725
How long were you planning
to hide this from me

496
00:38:06,005 --> 00:38:08,565
Until you trusted me completely.

497
00:38:09,245 --> 00:38:11,045
You want me to trust a liar?

498
00:38:13,605 --> 00:38:14,805
Don't you find that ironic?

499
00:38:16,525 --> 00:38:18,685
But we're together now and I love you.

500
00:38:20,045 --> 00:38:21,245
I'm scared of your love.

501
00:38:22,165 --> 00:38:23,365
You hate An Ran,

502
00:38:23,445 --> 00:38:26,205
but how are you different from her?

503
00:38:27,205 --> 00:38:28,485
I never meant to hurt you!

504
00:38:28,925 --> 00:38:30,165
You hurt me mentally.

505
00:38:30,405 --> 00:38:32,045
Did you ever consider my feelings?

506
00:38:32,325 --> 00:38:33,805
I was only 21 years old.

507
00:38:33,885 --> 00:38:36,605
Fresh out of college with a bright future
ahead. Then a death sentence.

508
00:38:37,085 --> 00:38:38,525
You only thought about what you want.

509
00:38:38,605 --> 00:38:41,405
Do you know how much pain
I suffered back then?

510
00:38:42,005 --> 00:38:44,005
If it's a happy ending,
does the process matter?

511
00:38:44,085 --> 00:38:45,325
Isn't it important, Ling Yizhou?

512
00:38:46,125 --> 00:38:47,165
What am I to you?

513
00:38:47,645 --> 00:38:51,445
A puppet for you to manipulate?
A pet for your amusement?

514
00:38:57,285 --> 00:38:59,085
You've seen how I treat you.

515
00:39:00,845 --> 00:39:03,085
I've always wanted
to give you a grand wedding.

516
00:39:03,165 --> 00:39:06,165
I've always wanted to announce
to the world that you are my wife.

517
00:39:06,645 --> 00:39:07,805
What about you?

518
00:39:07,885 --> 00:39:10,205
You keep running and hiding.
Have you given me a chance?

519
00:39:10,645 --> 00:39:12,925
I keep breaking my own boundaries for you.

520
00:39:13,485 --> 00:39:14,565
Yet now you ask me...

521
00:39:15,645 --> 00:39:17,045
what you are to me.

522
00:39:17,405 --> 00:39:19,005
What do you think you are to me?

523
00:39:19,245 --> 00:39:21,325
I only ask for honesty and respect.

524
00:39:21,725 --> 00:39:24,005
No surveillance, no shadowing, no lies.

525
00:39:38,965 --> 00:39:40,405
If I could start over again...

526
00:39:42,005 --> 00:39:43,165
I would do the same thing.

527
00:39:50,005 --> 00:39:51,525
I'm very disappointed with you.

528
00:40:02,325 --> 00:40:03,165
Mumu!

529
00:40:10,045 --> 00:40:10,885
Hello.

530
00:40:12,325 --> 00:40:13,285
Where are you?

531
00:40:13,365 --> 00:40:14,485
<i>I'm at home.</i>

532
00:40:14,885 --> 00:40:18,045
<i>I just watched a romantic movie.</i>

533
00:40:18,325 --> 00:40:19,605
You're finished filming?

534
00:40:21,165 --> 00:40:22,285
<i>In the movie,</i>

535
00:40:22,565 --> 00:40:26,445
<i>the couple said three words</i>
<i>to each other before they parted.</i>

536
00:40:27,285 --> 00:40:28,205
<i>Guess what they said.</i>

537
00:40:30,005 --> 00:40:31,325
What do I get if I get it right?

538
00:40:31,685 --> 00:40:33,725
<i>I'll definitely satisfy you, alright?</i>

539
00:40:36,045 --> 00:40:36,885
Mumu.

540
00:40:37,285 --> 00:40:38,365
<i>Just say it.</i>

541
00:40:40,685 --> 00:40:43,965
I love you.

542
00:40:47,005 --> 00:40:48,005
-Director Ling.
-Sir.

543
00:40:55,365 --> 00:40:57,565
Thank you, everyone.
Let's continue with our meeting.

544
00:42:25,765 --> 00:42:27,525

545
00:42:27,765 --> 00:42:30,725
Mr. Ling just wants you
to get some rest at home.

546
00:42:30,805 --> 00:42:32,525
Ling Yizhou, you love being in control.

547
00:42:33,165 --> 00:42:34,805
Even in love, you try to set people up.

548
00:42:35,165 --> 00:42:36,605
I was just trying to protect you.

549
00:42:36,685 --> 00:42:37,965
I'm not your pet.

550
00:42:38,165 --> 00:42:39,845
I can survive
without you taking care of me.

551
00:42:41,005 --> 00:42:42,605
I won't let you go.

552
00:42:42,965 --> 00:42:44,525
I never thought about getting a divorce.

553
00:42:44,605 --> 00:42:46,765
I just wanted some time
to think about our relationship.

554
00:42:47,125 --> 00:42:49,085
I never thought you would lock me up.
