1
00:00:13,085 --> 00:00:15,685
Mr. Ling, marriage is something serious.

2
00:00:15,765 --> 00:00:17,725
Please don't joke about my health.

3
00:00:18,725 --> 00:00:22,125
Miss Xia, we're just taking
what we need from this marriage.

4
00:00:22,565 --> 00:00:25,085
Ling Yizhou, his best friend Chu Yan,

5
00:00:25,165 --> 00:00:27,565
and his assistant Wen Li
definitely have something going on.

6
00:00:27,645 --> 00:00:29,445
If that's not a love triangle, what is?

7
00:00:29,725 --> 00:00:30,885
So...

8
00:00:31,805 --> 00:00:33,245
he wants to marry me

9
00:00:33,805 --> 00:00:35,205
to use me as his smokescreen.

10
00:00:35,485 --> 00:00:36,685
The reason isn't important.

11
00:00:37,005 --> 00:00:39,805
What's important is
whether you accept my proposal.

12
00:00:42,365 --> 00:00:46,045
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

13
00:02:13,005 --> 00:02:16,005
EPISODE 3

14
00:02:16,965 --> 00:02:18,925
TWO MONTHS LATER

15
00:02:20,205 --> 00:02:23,685
Now I'll be living here all alone.

16
00:02:24,965 --> 00:02:27,005
You can come visit me
once I've settled down.

17
00:02:27,085 --> 00:02:30,005
Aren't you eager to know more
about Ling Yizhou's private life?

18
00:02:31,205 --> 00:02:32,285
That's more like it.

19
00:02:32,725 --> 00:02:35,445
But he didn't even show up
when you left the hospital.

20
00:02:35,525 --> 00:02:37,165
Your relationship...

21
00:02:37,725 --> 00:02:39,085
He had to attend a meeting.

22
00:02:39,645 --> 00:02:43,485
Moreover, he visited me almost every day
for the past two months at the hospital.

23
00:02:43,565 --> 00:02:46,205
He donated his bone marrow to me
and he took care of me.

24
00:02:46,285 --> 00:02:47,645
I feel bad already.

25
00:02:48,205 --> 00:02:49,885
You haven't even moved in yet.

26
00:02:49,965 --> 00:02:51,805
You're already on his team, huh?

27
00:02:51,885 --> 00:02:52,765
I'm not.

28
00:02:53,325 --> 00:02:54,925
Leaving the hospital isn't a big deal.

29
00:02:55,005 --> 00:02:56,605
There's no need to trouble him.

30
00:02:57,125 --> 00:02:58,285
His assistant picked me up.

31
00:02:59,525 --> 00:03:00,605
Wen Li...

32
00:03:01,325 --> 00:03:02,805
Trying so hard to impress his boss.

33
00:03:02,885 --> 00:03:06,245
He just wants to break up
my official couple, Mr. Chu and Mr. Ling.

34
00:03:07,165 --> 00:03:08,085
Tell me.

35
00:03:08,405 --> 00:03:10,245
When you're with Mr. Ling,

36
00:03:10,325 --> 00:03:13,045
is his behavior suspicious?

37
00:03:14,765 --> 00:03:15,605
I'm a businessman.

38
00:03:16,245 --> 00:03:17,445
I never take any losses.

39
00:03:17,525 --> 00:03:20,845
Helping you doesn't benefit me
in any aspect.

40
00:03:21,525 --> 00:03:24,045
Sometimes he's indifferent.

41
00:03:25,085 --> 00:03:29,205
But sometimes he's very caring and gentle.

42
00:03:29,845 --> 00:03:31,285
<i>Love isn't everything in a marriage.</i>

43
00:03:31,805 --> 00:03:33,965
<i>Love doesn't necessarily</i>
<i>equal a happy marriage.</i>

44
00:03:34,645 --> 00:03:35,805
In my opinion,

45
00:03:36,485 --> 00:03:39,725
marriage is more like a responsibility.

46
00:03:41,285 --> 00:03:42,605
He makes me feel secure.

47
00:03:43,285 --> 00:03:44,885
Be careful, then.

48
00:03:45,285 --> 00:03:47,045
Don't become a gay man's best friend.

49
00:03:47,525 --> 00:03:49,085
If you fall in love with him...

50
00:03:50,605 --> 00:03:53,365
That's impossible. I'm not a masochist.

51
00:03:53,965 --> 00:03:54,925
Good.

52
00:03:56,565 --> 00:03:59,485
Mr. Ling may not give you romance,

53
00:03:59,925 --> 00:04:01,845
but you can be a family.

54
00:04:02,325 --> 00:04:05,245
The familial bond is even stronger
than that of romance.

55
00:04:06,045 --> 00:04:09,365
Now that you have him to lean on
like a giant rock,

56
00:04:09,445 --> 00:04:11,525
you can do whatever you want in Gangdong.

57
00:04:12,045 --> 00:04:14,365
Don't say that.
I don't want a giant rock to lean on.

58
00:04:14,445 --> 00:04:15,805
I don't want to get crushed.

59
00:04:16,805 --> 00:04:17,965
Count your blessings.

60
00:04:18,885 --> 00:04:22,125
Mr. Ling has got an amazing voice,
a handsome face,

61
00:04:22,205 --> 00:04:23,685
a smashing hot body,

62
00:04:23,765 --> 00:04:25,325
and he comes from a wealthy family.

63
00:04:25,404 --> 00:04:27,285
He's the best catch in Gangdong.

64
00:04:27,365 --> 00:04:29,325
You're getting the better end of the deal.

65
00:04:29,605 --> 00:04:31,645
And you'll be living in his house.

66
00:04:32,085 --> 00:04:34,205
You'll see Mr. Chu all the time.

67
00:04:35,485 --> 00:04:36,685
Speaking of Chu Yan,

68
00:04:37,205 --> 00:04:38,285
what you said is true.

69
00:04:39,325 --> 00:04:42,285
He's extremely possessive of Ling Yizhou.

70
00:04:42,725 --> 00:04:45,285
He's always so hostile towards me.

71
00:04:46,325 --> 00:04:47,285
Oh, my God.

72
00:04:47,685 --> 00:04:49,005
My heart...

73
00:04:49,605 --> 00:04:52,405
Xia Lin, how dare you?
You snatched my Chu Yan.

74
00:04:52,885 --> 00:04:53,965
We must have a duel.

75
00:04:55,005 --> 00:04:57,165
Gosh. I can't stand you.

76
00:04:57,245 --> 00:04:58,485
He's so cute...

77
00:05:33,885 --> 00:05:35,165
Hello, beautiful.

78
00:05:40,125 --> 00:05:42,645
Stop it, Chu Yan.

79
00:05:44,565 --> 00:05:46,605
Our little princess has
completed her studies abroad.

80
00:05:51,205 --> 00:05:52,085
Where is Yizhou?

81
00:05:55,085 --> 00:05:56,805
He must be busy.

82
00:05:58,365 --> 00:05:59,565
OK, little princess.

83
00:05:59,925 --> 00:06:02,405
If you don't want to see us
in the gossip columns tomorrow,

84
00:06:03,205 --> 00:06:04,405
get in the car now. Come on.

85
00:06:13,245 --> 00:06:14,885
OK. No problem.

86
00:06:16,485 --> 00:06:17,365
Mr. Wen.

87
00:06:18,805 --> 00:06:21,405
I know we kind of got off
on the wrong foot.

88
00:06:21,485 --> 00:06:23,005
You're always by Director Ling's side.

89
00:06:23,085 --> 00:06:26,125
Please take care of Linlin.

90
00:06:26,405 --> 00:06:28,405
Of course, Miss Jia.
It's my responsibility.

91
00:06:30,605 --> 00:06:32,845
Mr. Wen, do you have a girlfriend?

92
00:06:34,165 --> 00:06:35,005
No.

93
00:06:35,685 --> 00:06:37,125
Why don't you go find one?

94
00:06:37,445 --> 00:06:39,125
I'm sure a lot of women

95
00:06:39,205 --> 00:06:41,325
like men your type.

96
00:06:44,365 --> 00:06:47,045
I want to focus on work.
I don't want to date right now.

97
00:06:47,805 --> 00:06:50,765
So, you're saying if you had a girlfriend,

98
00:06:50,845 --> 00:06:53,565
you wouldn't do a good job at work?

99
00:06:54,085 --> 00:06:55,445
I meant...

100
00:06:55,525 --> 00:06:57,685
Relax. I'm just teasing you.

101
00:06:58,365 --> 00:07:01,045
Give me your business card.
I'll find you a girlfriend.

102
00:07:06,045 --> 00:07:06,885
Thanks.

103
00:07:11,565 --> 00:07:12,805
Lisa wants to see me tomorrow.

104
00:07:13,365 --> 00:07:14,245
Workaholic.

105
00:07:14,325 --> 00:07:16,645
No matter how busy you are,
be sure to take care of yourself.

106
00:07:16,925 --> 00:07:18,405
Or you'll be hearing from me.

107
00:07:18,645 --> 00:07:20,165
Got it, Fei.

108
00:07:21,525 --> 00:07:23,645
Until next time, Mr. Wen.

109
00:07:23,725 --> 00:07:25,965
I have so many questions for you.

110
00:07:29,365 --> 00:07:30,205
Bye.

111
00:07:32,845 --> 00:07:34,525
YIZHOU

112
00:07:40,885 --> 00:07:43,165
Don't bother.
Even I haven't seen him in two months.

113
00:07:44,645 --> 00:07:48,925
Does he have a girlfriend?

114
00:07:50,325 --> 00:07:52,285
Ling? Impossible.

115
00:07:57,725 --> 00:08:01,005
Did you think he was waiting for you?

116
00:08:01,365 --> 00:08:02,285
Why not?

117
00:08:02,765 --> 00:08:05,285
I've been the only woman
in his life for years.

118
00:08:09,965 --> 00:08:10,805
Little princess...

119
00:08:11,805 --> 00:08:14,165
if a man really was interested in you,

120
00:08:14,245 --> 00:08:15,845
he would do something about it.

121
00:08:16,205 --> 00:08:17,165
Therefore,

122
00:08:17,245 --> 00:08:19,285
stop thinking so much. Enjoy your meal.

123
00:08:19,725 --> 00:08:21,405
I don't have an appetite.

124
00:08:23,085 --> 00:08:24,165
You've been abroad too long.

125
00:08:24,765 --> 00:08:27,005
Do you know how many people
want to have dinner with me?

126
00:08:28,245 --> 00:08:32,245
Alright. You're the best, Chu Yan.

127
00:08:32,605 --> 00:08:34,765
Can you take me to him after we eat?

128
00:08:35,605 --> 00:08:38,605
I promise I'll tell your dad
how great you are.

129
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:39,564
What do you say?

130
00:08:40,605 --> 00:08:41,684
Whatever.

131
00:08:45,725 --> 00:08:46,564
Deal.

132
00:08:54,925 --> 00:08:55,765
Good morning, ma'am.

133
00:08:56,605 --> 00:08:58,765
Hello. You can just call me Xia Lin.

134
00:08:59,285 --> 00:09:00,285
Surely I can't.

135
00:09:00,365 --> 00:09:02,765
Ms. Huang. I'll leave her with you.

136
00:09:02,845 --> 00:09:05,085
-I need to get back to the office.
-OK.

137
00:09:05,165 --> 00:09:06,085
Thank you, Mr. Wen.

138
00:09:08,805 --> 00:09:10,045
Here. Please come in.

139
00:09:11,365 --> 00:09:12,205
Careful.

140
00:09:15,365 --> 00:09:17,285
Ma'am, your room is upstairs.

141
00:09:18,765 --> 00:09:20,645
<i>It kind of feels like home.</i>

142
00:09:21,125 --> 00:09:22,245
<i>Good choice.</i>

143
00:09:23,205 --> 00:09:26,685
Ms. Huang. Do you have many visitors here?

144
00:09:26,925 --> 00:09:27,805
Not many.

145
00:09:27,885 --> 00:09:31,165
Usually it's just Mr. Chu and Mr. Wen.

146
00:09:31,485 --> 00:09:34,405
Mr. Ling doesn't like visitors.

147
00:09:35,485 --> 00:09:37,565
What about his family?

148
00:09:38,245 --> 00:09:40,325
His father died a long time ago.

149
00:09:40,725 --> 00:09:42,085
As for his mother...

150
00:09:43,085 --> 00:09:45,085
you can ask him yourself later.

151
00:09:45,685 --> 00:09:46,765
Take a look at the room.

152
00:09:47,165 --> 00:09:48,925
Let me know if you need anything.

153
00:10:09,805 --> 00:10:12,085
It's not how I imagined.

154
00:10:13,325 --> 00:10:14,325
But that's OK.

155
00:10:36,205 --> 00:10:39,525
Is this the right room?

156
00:10:54,045 --> 00:10:54,925
Ms. Huang.

157
00:10:55,005 --> 00:10:56,405
Mr. Chu, Miss An.

158
00:11:21,285 --> 00:11:23,285
What? Enjoying the view?

159
00:11:23,885 --> 00:11:26,685
Why are you at home?

160
00:11:26,765 --> 00:11:27,725
What are you doing here?

161
00:11:28,845 --> 00:11:30,005
This is my room.

162
00:11:30,085 --> 00:11:32,885
Could it be that...
you don't want to sleep in separate rooms?

163
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:35,965
No... Ms. Huang brought me in.

164
00:11:36,325 --> 00:11:38,885
-She doesn't know that...
-Ms. Huang works for Grandma.

165
00:11:39,205 --> 00:11:41,845
If she finds out we don't sleep together,
she'll be suspicious.

166
00:11:42,405 --> 00:11:43,725
But we signed a contract.

167
00:11:44,205 --> 00:11:45,925
Don't you want to sleep in the same room?

168
00:11:46,285 --> 00:11:47,885
It's not about what I think,

169
00:11:47,965 --> 00:11:49,445
it's just inconvenient.

170
00:11:49,805 --> 00:11:50,645
How so?

171
00:11:53,125 --> 00:11:55,485
Being with a handsome man...

172
00:11:55,885 --> 00:11:57,925
I don't know if I can control myself.

173
00:12:05,085 --> 00:12:08,605
What would you do
if you couldn't control yourself?

174
00:12:16,165 --> 00:12:17,005
Yizhou?

175
00:12:20,925 --> 00:12:21,885
What are you doing?

176
00:12:24,165 --> 00:12:25,165
Wait in the living room.

177
00:12:28,045 --> 00:12:29,405
Oh, no...

178
00:12:33,165 --> 00:12:34,125
Can I yell for help?

179
00:12:36,685 --> 00:12:40,205
It's just that your skin is so smooth.

180
00:13:01,325 --> 00:13:02,325
Yizhou.

181
00:13:04,845 --> 00:13:06,405
Long time no see. You've grown taller.

182
00:13:06,765 --> 00:13:08,085
You didn't pick me up.

183
00:13:08,165 --> 00:13:09,805
You didn't answer my calls.

184
00:13:11,205 --> 00:13:12,045
I was busy.

185
00:13:12,765 --> 00:13:14,605
Busy with her?

186
00:13:15,445 --> 00:13:17,125
I've never heard you talk about her.

187
00:13:18,445 --> 00:13:20,965
I'm nobody. Not worth mentioning.

188
00:13:21,565 --> 00:13:22,765
Xia Lin.

189
00:13:23,805 --> 00:13:25,605
You can't tell me again now

190
00:13:25,925 --> 00:13:27,285
that you don't know Ling.

191
00:13:33,405 --> 00:13:35,725
Don't be mean, Chu Yan.

192
00:13:36,005 --> 00:13:38,725
It takes time for people
to get to know each other.

193
00:13:39,045 --> 00:13:42,725
Yizhou's friend is our friend.

194
00:13:42,925 --> 00:13:44,165
Yizhou.

195
00:13:44,245 --> 00:13:46,525
Why did you move to this house?

196
00:13:47,285 --> 00:13:50,845
An Ran, she isn't my friend.
She's my wife.

197
00:13:51,325 --> 00:13:53,165
We moved here
because she likes this place.

198
00:13:53,725 --> 00:13:55,125
What did you say?

199
00:13:55,485 --> 00:13:56,325
You're married?

200
00:13:57,365 --> 00:13:58,485
Why didn't you tell me?

201
00:13:58,565 --> 00:14:00,445
It was two months ago.
I forgot to tell you.

202
00:14:00,925 --> 00:14:03,405
Forgot? How could you forget
something like this?

203
00:14:05,925 --> 00:14:08,005
I was wondering why you moved here.

204
00:14:08,325 --> 00:14:09,645
So it's because of her.

205
00:14:13,365 --> 00:14:14,325
Go cut up some fruit.

206
00:14:20,565 --> 00:14:21,965
Ling.

207
00:14:22,045 --> 00:14:23,965
Marriage is a good thing. I support you.

208
00:14:24,045 --> 00:14:25,565
But why her?

209
00:14:26,045 --> 00:14:27,805
You knew why she approached you.

210
00:14:27,885 --> 00:14:29,645
You knew what kind of person she was.

211
00:14:30,205 --> 00:14:31,885
I think there's been a misunderstanding.

212
00:14:32,685 --> 00:14:36,005
I don't care what kind of person she was.
She's mine now.

213
00:14:38,325 --> 00:14:40,205
Xia Lin. Watch your fingers.

214
00:14:40,965 --> 00:14:41,845
Let me do it.

215
00:14:56,485 --> 00:14:57,325
Chu Yan.

216
00:14:58,725 --> 00:15:00,205
Can you give me a ride home?

217
00:15:00,925 --> 00:15:02,605
I'm a bit tired.

218
00:15:15,725 --> 00:15:16,565
Are you OK?

219
00:15:17,525 --> 00:15:18,565
Chu Yan.

220
00:15:18,925 --> 00:15:20,125
Who is she?

221
00:15:21,045 --> 00:15:23,885
She's just a D-list actress.

222
00:15:24,765 --> 00:15:26,325
I guess she's good at mind games.

223
00:15:26,845 --> 00:15:27,885
I underestimated her.

224
00:15:29,085 --> 00:15:31,245
Ling's never had a girlfriend.
She must have fooled him.

225
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:34,805
Even if Yizhou got caught up in her charm,

226
00:15:35,285 --> 00:15:37,125
his grandma wouldn't
let this happen, right?

227
00:15:41,605 --> 00:15:42,685
I've got an idea.

228
00:15:43,005 --> 00:15:44,285
Let's go. I'll take you home.

229
00:15:50,605 --> 00:15:51,845
-What now?
-What now?

230
00:15:52,365 --> 00:15:53,925
What if they tell people?

231
00:15:55,805 --> 00:15:57,245
Is it embarrassing to be my wife?

232
00:15:57,805 --> 00:15:58,845
No.

233
00:15:59,205 --> 00:16:01,165
Our marriage contract
only lasts two years.

234
00:16:01,485 --> 00:16:03,405
Making it public
would cause both of us trouble.

235
00:16:03,965 --> 00:16:05,325
You're a very private person.

236
00:16:05,405 --> 00:16:07,765
I'm sure you don't want more attention
on your personal life.

237
00:16:07,845 --> 00:16:10,965
So, let's just start it secretly

238
00:16:11,365 --> 00:16:12,245
and end it secretly.

239
00:16:12,765 --> 00:16:15,725
If you can't even talk
about our relationship,

240
00:16:16,205 --> 00:16:17,845
how can you fool my grandma?

241
00:16:18,845 --> 00:16:20,845
If she finds out our marriage is a sham,

242
00:16:21,445 --> 00:16:22,565
you know what will happen.

243
00:16:22,885 --> 00:16:24,085
Don't worry.

244
00:16:24,165 --> 00:16:26,245
I'll keep my end of the bargain.

245
00:16:26,525 --> 00:16:29,965
But my career is just taking off.

246
00:16:30,245 --> 00:16:32,645
I don't want the public
to focus on the wrong things.

247
00:16:32,965 --> 00:16:34,765
That's why the contract states that

248
00:16:34,845 --> 00:16:37,085
the marriage should be kept hidden
from the public.

249
00:16:39,645 --> 00:16:41,365
-I deleted that.
-What?

250
00:16:41,765 --> 00:16:43,405
You didn't consult me first.

251
00:16:43,845 --> 00:16:45,205
Is there a need for discussion?

252
00:16:47,245 --> 00:16:48,085
You...

253
00:16:50,085 --> 00:16:52,285
You don't respect your partner's opinion?

254
00:16:54,685 --> 00:16:56,445
Which room should I stay in?

255
00:16:57,045 --> 00:16:58,125
Upstairs. The first room.

256
00:17:01,005 --> 00:17:02,045
So bossy.

257
00:17:06,845 --> 00:17:07,685
Stop right there.

258
00:17:21,885 --> 00:17:22,725
Old man...

259
00:17:23,604 --> 00:17:25,124
my face is my only asset.

260
00:17:25,364 --> 00:17:26,364
If you damage it...

261
00:17:27,205 --> 00:17:28,205
I'll lose market value.

262
00:17:28,604 --> 00:17:30,124
I told you to pick up An Ran,

263
00:17:30,805 --> 00:17:32,245
not drive her to see Ling Yizhou.

264
00:17:32,725 --> 00:17:33,685
You had me followed?

265
00:17:33,925 --> 00:17:36,965
I can let go of the incident
with Miss Yuan.

266
00:17:37,325 --> 00:17:38,565
But An Ran is different.

267
00:17:39,645 --> 00:17:41,405
Her family owns Xing An Entertainment.

268
00:17:41,485 --> 00:17:42,645
You have to win her over.

269
00:17:44,725 --> 00:17:46,565
With your marriage,
our families become one.

270
00:17:47,325 --> 00:17:49,445
Then we can stand up to the Ling family.

271
00:17:50,245 --> 00:17:51,125
Excuse me.

272
00:17:52,045 --> 00:17:55,125
Knowing that I'm being spied on
kills my mood for romance.

273
00:17:56,085 --> 00:17:59,125
You can realize your grand vision
on your own.

274
00:17:59,765 --> 00:18:02,205
Or maybe... you can adopt another child.

275
00:18:03,805 --> 00:18:05,205
-You rotten child!
-Calm down.

276
00:18:06,045 --> 00:18:06,925
I'm leaving now.

277
00:19:18,365 --> 00:19:19,285
You're so silly.

278
00:19:20,125 --> 00:19:23,125
If you needed something,
why didn't you ask for help?

279
00:19:23,845 --> 00:19:25,445
I didn't want to bother you.

280
00:19:25,525 --> 00:19:29,245
You're the only one in the world who's
allowed to bother me, besides my grandma.

281
00:19:30,885 --> 00:19:33,685
I'm fine now. Thank you.
You can carry on with your business.

282
00:19:36,365 --> 00:19:38,125
What are you doing? I can walk by myself.

283
00:19:55,765 --> 00:19:56,765
Ms. Huang.

284
00:19:57,005 --> 00:19:58,805
This looks amazing.

285
00:19:59,805 --> 00:20:02,085
I'm glad you like it, ma'am.
Enjoy your breakfast.

286
00:20:08,485 --> 00:20:12,925
<i>Is this like the ancient times,</i>
<i>where speaking is forbidden while eating?</i>

287
00:20:16,085 --> 00:20:16,965
I didn't say anything.

288
00:20:22,405 --> 00:20:23,245
Take this.

289
00:20:23,965 --> 00:20:25,925
No... I don't need money.

290
00:20:26,005 --> 00:20:27,645
I'm living here for free already.

291
00:20:28,245 --> 00:20:30,165
I don't want the early days
of our marriage

292
00:20:30,245 --> 00:20:32,525
to be soured by boring things like money.

293
00:20:32,925 --> 00:20:34,125
Money is a boring thing?

294
00:20:35,285 --> 00:20:36,445
In other words,

295
00:20:37,285 --> 00:20:40,645
I want you to take
the role you're playing seriously.

296
00:20:41,765 --> 00:20:42,925
<i>Here we go again.</i>

297
00:20:46,805 --> 00:20:49,045
Fine. I'll take it.

298
00:20:50,925 --> 00:20:52,565
<i>I won't use it anyway.</i>

299
00:20:52,845 --> 00:20:54,125
The PIN number is 0608.

300
00:20:56,685 --> 00:20:58,365
You're too kind.

301
00:20:58,805 --> 00:21:00,965
-The PIN is my birthday?
-It's my birthday.

302
00:21:01,405 --> 00:21:03,645
-Your birthday is June 8th, too?
-Of course.

303
00:21:06,805 --> 00:21:11,085
We're a bone marrow match
and we have the same birthday?

304
00:21:11,525 --> 00:21:12,965
Maybe we are actually

305
00:21:13,045 --> 00:21:15,285
long-lost brother and sister.

306
00:21:15,965 --> 00:21:17,885
I don't want to have a sister like you.

307
00:21:20,725 --> 00:21:21,925
<i>He's so serious.</i>

308
00:21:22,365 --> 00:21:25,245
<i>Maybe he only jokes with guys.</i>

309
00:21:27,125 --> 00:21:28,365
I'll take you to the office.

310
00:21:29,845 --> 00:21:30,685
No. It's fine.

311
00:21:31,285 --> 00:21:33,085
It's time. I need to go now.

312
00:21:33,325 --> 00:21:34,165
Wait.

313
00:21:34,885 --> 00:21:37,445
Come home before 5 p.m.
We're having dinner at Grandma's.

314
00:21:37,965 --> 00:21:38,805
Got it.

315
00:21:44,205 --> 00:21:45,805
TIANYI MEDIA &amp; CULTURE CO.

316
00:21:47,805 --> 00:21:48,685
Lisa.

317
00:21:50,885 --> 00:21:51,885
What's your problem?

318
00:21:52,725 --> 00:21:54,165
I've never seen an actress like you.

319
00:21:54,245 --> 00:21:56,405
Taking two months off
when your career is taking off?

320
00:21:56,925 --> 00:21:58,445
I promise this is the last time.

321
00:21:58,725 --> 00:22:01,725
Lisa, are there any TV shows for me?

322
00:22:02,005 --> 00:22:03,565
I don't have time for that.

323
00:22:03,645 --> 00:22:05,685
The red carpet event is driving me crazy.

324
00:22:06,485 --> 00:22:08,965
What red carpet event? Can I go?

325
00:22:09,445 --> 00:22:10,365
Not a chance.

326
00:22:10,445 --> 00:22:13,205
Only two people can accompany
Yin Shuangshuang to the movie premiere.

327
00:22:13,765 --> 00:22:15,045
One has already been decided.

328
00:22:15,445 --> 00:22:17,085
Do you think you could be the other one?

329
00:22:17,685 --> 00:22:18,805
Why not?

330
00:22:19,165 --> 00:22:20,805
I can show my abilities.

331
00:22:21,165 --> 00:22:22,765
Our agency represents so many artists.

332
00:22:22,845 --> 00:22:24,365
They have all kinds of talents.

333
00:22:24,925 --> 00:22:26,365
Who cares about your abilities?

334
00:22:27,045 --> 00:22:28,165
You don't stand a chance.

335
00:22:34,005 --> 00:22:35,005
Anything else?

336
00:22:35,685 --> 00:22:36,525
No.

337
00:22:36,885 --> 00:22:37,765
You can go now.

338
00:22:45,805 --> 00:22:47,765
Chu Yan, when is your new show coming out?

339
00:22:48,005 --> 00:22:49,285
Soon. In about two weeks.

340
00:22:49,365 --> 00:22:52,005
<i>I should have read</i>
<i>my daily horoscope this morning.</i>

341
00:22:52,085 --> 00:22:53,125
<i>What an unlucky day for me.</i>

342
00:22:53,965 --> 00:22:56,205
Why are you hiding from us?
You look suspicious.

343
00:22:57,765 --> 00:22:59,725
Who is she?

344
00:23:01,165 --> 00:23:03,085
Hello, Mr. Chu. Ms. Shuangshuang.

345
00:23:03,165 --> 00:23:05,685
My name is Xia Lin.
I joined the company last year.

346
00:23:05,765 --> 00:23:07,445
Lisa is my agent.

347
00:23:09,485 --> 00:23:10,405
Ms. Shuangshuang.

348
00:23:10,645 --> 00:23:13,565
I'd like to talk to you
about the red carpet event.

349
00:23:14,125 --> 00:23:15,365
I'm not in charge of that.

350
00:23:15,805 --> 00:23:17,565
-It's the company's decision.
-But...

351
00:23:19,405 --> 00:23:21,165
What's the matter?
You have a crush on her?

352
00:23:22,365 --> 00:23:23,245
I'm not blind.

353
00:23:24,165 --> 00:23:25,005
It's just that

354
00:23:25,765 --> 00:23:27,005
she looks just like

355
00:23:27,085 --> 00:23:29,605
my buddy's new wife.

356
00:23:33,365 --> 00:23:35,685
Come on. Your only buddy is Director Ling.

357
00:23:39,725 --> 00:23:40,925
-Well, he--
-Ms. Shuangshuang.

358
00:23:41,685 --> 00:23:44,045
If I had the opportunity
to walk the red carpet with you,

359
00:23:44,125 --> 00:23:46,645
I'd make it my mission
to help you stand out.

360
00:23:48,205 --> 00:23:49,365
Thanks.

361
00:24:03,285 --> 00:24:05,245
The esteemed Mrs. Ling

362
00:24:05,805 --> 00:24:08,045
is begging for a spot on the red carpet.

363
00:24:08,125 --> 00:24:10,925
It seems like Ling
hasn't done you any favors.

364
00:24:11,565 --> 00:24:13,005
You're still the sidekick.

365
00:24:13,565 --> 00:24:14,685
The title of Mrs. Ling

366
00:24:15,365 --> 00:24:16,525
hasn't really benefited you.

367
00:24:17,565 --> 00:24:18,405
By the way...

368
00:24:19,445 --> 00:24:24,205
in front of Ling, are you trying
to be the strong, independent girl?

369
00:24:25,765 --> 00:24:26,765
Mr. Chu.

370
00:24:27,205 --> 00:24:29,285
I think there's been
a misunderstanding between us.

371
00:24:30,925 --> 00:24:33,365
I wish that your marriage

372
00:24:34,045 --> 00:24:35,805
was a big misunderstanding.

373
00:24:37,725 --> 00:24:40,325
<i>He's so jealous.</i>

374
00:24:41,365 --> 00:24:42,565
Mr. Chu,

375
00:24:42,645 --> 00:24:46,565
if you have any complaints
about our marriage, tell Ling Yizhou.

376
00:24:47,045 --> 00:24:48,045
I'll excuse myself now.

377
00:24:49,725 --> 00:24:50,565
I'm telling you...

378
00:24:52,005 --> 00:24:54,885
I don't know how you won Ling Yizhou over.

379
00:24:55,685 --> 00:24:57,685
But you'd better watch out.

380
00:24:57,765 --> 00:24:58,965
I'm going to expose you.

381
00:24:59,485 --> 00:25:03,445
Why didn't you just tell
Ms. Shuangshuang then?

382
00:25:03,525 --> 00:25:04,525
You think I'm dumb?

383
00:25:05,405 --> 00:25:07,725
Why would I tell the world
that you're Mrs. Ling?

384
00:25:08,565 --> 00:25:09,965
I hope nobody ever finds out.

385
00:25:11,685 --> 00:25:14,085
Mr. Chu, I know you're a busy man.
I'll get going now.

386
00:25:15,125 --> 00:25:17,285
Wait. I'm not done yet.

387
00:25:18,245 --> 00:25:19,285
What else do you need?

388
00:25:20,685 --> 00:25:21,685
Everybody knows

389
00:25:22,325 --> 00:25:24,605
that your ultimate goal is to be famous.

390
00:25:24,685 --> 00:25:26,365
I have a lot of influence in showbiz.

391
00:25:28,165 --> 00:25:30,405
Tell me what you really want from him.

392
00:25:31,565 --> 00:25:33,525
I don't have an ulterior motive.

393
00:25:33,885 --> 00:25:35,445
Ling Yizhou is an adult.

394
00:25:36,005 --> 00:25:37,245
Do you think I could trick him?

395
00:25:39,085 --> 00:25:41,165
He doesn't have
a lot of experience with women.

396
00:25:41,245 --> 00:25:42,765
Especially conniving ones like you.

397
00:25:43,805 --> 00:25:46,165
I'm telling you,
if you're trying to scam him,

398
00:25:46,965 --> 00:25:47,925
I'll stop you.

399
00:25:49,445 --> 00:25:50,645
You...

400
00:25:51,045 --> 00:25:53,445
You want to hit me?
What are you trying to do?

401
00:25:53,525 --> 00:25:54,725
You missed.

402
00:25:59,725 --> 00:26:01,725
-Move your foot.
-No.

403
00:26:03,245 --> 00:26:04,405
Let go of me.

404
00:26:04,485 --> 00:26:06,765
That's quite a lot of makeup
you've got on today.

405
00:26:07,525 --> 00:26:08,485
Chu Yan...

406
00:26:16,325 --> 00:26:17,965
Dance like that for the audition, OK?

407
00:26:18,045 --> 00:26:19,405
I got it. Thank you, Mr. Chu.

408
00:26:20,125 --> 00:26:21,085
Lisa.

409
00:26:21,405 --> 00:26:22,725
What are you two doing together?

410
00:26:22,805 --> 00:26:23,845
We bumped into each other.

411
00:26:24,245 --> 00:26:26,925
You can talk to him now, Lisa. Goodbye.

412
00:26:27,525 --> 00:26:29,085
-Thank you, Mr. Chu.
-You're welcome.

413
00:26:29,565 --> 00:26:30,645
Goodbye, Lisa.

414
00:26:31,725 --> 00:26:32,565
Good luck.

415
00:26:35,645 --> 00:26:37,165
You saw Mr. Chu again?

416
00:26:37,245 --> 00:26:38,445
I'd rather not talk about it.

417
00:26:38,525 --> 00:26:41,045
He seems to think I'm his love rival.

418
00:26:41,125 --> 00:26:42,325
What about Mr. Ling?

419
00:26:42,685 --> 00:26:44,845
I think he was pretending
to be a gentleman.

420
00:26:45,645 --> 00:26:47,045
Now he can't fake it anymore.

421
00:26:47,685 --> 00:26:48,965
His true colors are coming out.

422
00:26:49,325 --> 00:26:52,325
Bosses are always good at giving orders.

423
00:26:52,405 --> 00:26:54,125
They're very difficult to conquer.

424
00:26:54,445 --> 00:26:57,845
However, if you beat him,
you'll get a big reward.

425
00:26:57,925 --> 00:27:00,765
So, how can I deal with...

426
00:27:02,165 --> 00:27:03,005
He's a thief!

427
00:27:08,085 --> 00:27:09,765
Xia Lin!

428
00:27:10,925 --> 00:27:12,085
I'm too tired.

429
00:27:12,165 --> 00:27:13,445
He's too fast.

430
00:27:14,245 --> 00:27:15,685
You don't have much money anyway.

431
00:27:16,165 --> 00:27:17,525
Did you have to chase him so hard?

432
00:27:17,605 --> 00:27:18,845
Of course I had to.

433
00:27:19,325 --> 00:27:20,845
I'm not worried about losing my money.

434
00:27:20,925 --> 00:27:23,085
I'm worried about losing
Ling Yizhou's black card.

435
00:27:24,085 --> 00:27:25,085
Black card?

436
00:27:25,765 --> 00:27:28,325
He just gave it to me today.
I've barely touched it.

437
00:27:28,685 --> 00:27:31,925
If he finds out I lost it,
I'd have to pay him everything I have.

438
00:27:32,445 --> 00:27:35,325
Why would he even bother?
You have nothing.

439
00:27:35,405 --> 00:27:37,285
-Come on.
-Where are we going?

440
00:27:37,725 --> 00:27:38,805
The police station.

441
00:27:39,085 --> 00:27:40,605
If the police can't find it,

442
00:27:41,125 --> 00:27:43,165
you'll just have to beg for mercy.

443
00:27:46,765 --> 00:27:47,805
You!

444
00:27:48,845 --> 00:27:50,165
We don't want the wallet.

445
00:27:50,805 --> 00:27:52,445
I'm so sorry.

446
00:27:52,525 --> 00:27:53,845
I shouldn't have stolen it.

447
00:27:53,925 --> 00:27:55,285
Please show some mercy.

448
00:27:55,765 --> 00:27:56,725
Please forgive me.

449
00:27:57,125 --> 00:28:00,965
I won't steal your wallet again.

450
00:28:04,245 --> 00:28:05,245
What's going on?

451
00:28:06,005 --> 00:28:07,045
Let's take a look.

452
00:28:15,125 --> 00:28:16,165
Everything's still in here.

453
00:28:17,045 --> 00:28:18,405
What was that all about?

454
00:28:32,445 --> 00:28:33,325
What's the matter?

455
00:28:39,285 --> 00:28:40,125
Just a reminder.

456
00:28:41,085 --> 00:28:42,165
Don't blow your cover.

457
00:28:44,765 --> 00:28:45,845
Got it?

458
00:28:46,325 --> 00:28:47,205
I got it.

459
00:28:50,765 --> 00:28:51,605
Come on.

460
00:28:53,925 --> 00:28:54,965
Yizhou.

461
00:28:56,085 --> 00:28:57,165
An Ran, you're here, too?

462
00:28:57,485 --> 00:28:59,445
Chu Yan and I came to see your grandma.

463
00:28:59,525 --> 00:29:00,965
I haven't seen her in so long.

464
00:29:01,285 --> 00:29:03,005
-I've missed her.
-Chu Yan's here, too?

465
00:29:03,365 --> 00:29:04,405
You're a good girl.

466
00:29:06,405 --> 00:29:07,245
Come on.

467
00:29:16,525 --> 00:29:17,405
Let's go.

468
00:29:35,205 --> 00:29:36,045
Here, Grandma.

469
00:29:37,325 --> 00:29:38,205
I want some, too.

470
00:29:39,965 --> 00:29:41,485
Don't you have hands?

471
00:29:41,565 --> 00:29:43,365
You should be taking care of your wife

472
00:29:43,925 --> 00:29:45,485
instead of letting her do the work.

473
00:29:48,085 --> 00:29:50,045
I must say though,

474
00:29:50,445 --> 00:29:52,565
how could you get married
without telling anyone?

475
00:29:53,125 --> 00:29:54,805
You didn't even tell me.

476
00:29:55,765 --> 00:29:58,365
Even if you're in love,
you can't be so impulsive.

477
00:29:59,765 --> 00:30:01,005
Mumu was eager to marry me.

478
00:30:02,085 --> 00:30:04,525
So we didn't think about it too much.
Right?

479
00:30:05,125 --> 00:30:05,965
Yes.

480
00:30:06,565 --> 00:30:07,405
Mumu?

481
00:30:09,165 --> 00:30:11,365
That comes from the character "Lin"
in her name, right?

482
00:30:12,925 --> 00:30:16,605
Great name. Mu, meaning wood, has been
made into a boat. The deed is done.

483
00:30:17,005 --> 00:30:18,725
That's what we'll call you from now on.

484
00:30:18,805 --> 00:30:20,485
Have some more food, Mumu.

485
00:30:20,565 --> 00:30:22,525
Take whatever you like.

486
00:30:24,605 --> 00:30:26,045
An Ran, you too.

487
00:30:26,485 --> 00:30:27,605
Chu Yan, have some more.

488
00:30:31,565 --> 00:30:33,765
Grandma is good to me,
so I'll be good to you.

489
00:30:33,845 --> 00:30:35,285
Yizhou doesn't eat spicy food.

490
00:30:40,805 --> 00:30:43,285
Mumu loves to eat spicy food,
so I'll eat a little, too.

491
00:30:51,405 --> 00:30:53,365
Eat some vegetables too.

492
00:30:54,805 --> 00:30:56,885
Ling hates carrots.

493
00:30:58,965 --> 00:31:01,045
What? You don't know that?

494
00:31:04,565 --> 00:31:06,205
Of course I do.

495
00:31:06,525 --> 00:31:09,005
But being a picky eater is bad for you.

496
00:31:10,685 --> 00:31:11,525
Right?

497
00:31:20,205 --> 00:31:21,045
Not bad.

498
00:31:22,725 --> 00:31:25,405
You really have a way with him, Mumu.

499
00:31:28,965 --> 00:31:30,965
Linlin. Can I call you Linlin?

500
00:31:32,205 --> 00:31:34,005
Chu Yan said

501
00:31:34,085 --> 00:31:36,005
you two are represented
by the same agency.

502
00:31:37,405 --> 00:31:40,165
Yes. It's wonderful.

503
00:31:41,445 --> 00:31:43,445
That's great. Chu Yan,

504
00:31:44,085 --> 00:31:46,605
you'll have to take good care
of our Mumu at work.

505
00:31:47,405 --> 00:31:48,965
Don't let anyone bully her.

506
00:31:50,325 --> 00:31:52,285
She's so unruly. Who would dare bully her?

507
00:31:53,525 --> 00:31:54,725
What did you say?

508
00:31:55,485 --> 00:31:57,405
Grandma,
I said I'll take good care of her.

509
00:31:58,685 --> 00:31:59,805
By the way, Yizhou,

510
00:32:00,205 --> 00:32:04,005
you could invest in a TV drama.
Linlin could be the leading actress.

511
00:32:05,005 --> 00:32:05,845
No...

512
00:32:06,565 --> 00:32:10,165
I prefer to separate
my personal life from work.

513
00:32:11,485 --> 00:32:14,965
I heard you were at the audition
for the Lingshi Group commercial.

514
00:32:16,325 --> 00:32:17,405
Very separate indeed.

515
00:32:18,605 --> 00:32:21,485
I didn't know Yizhou back then.

516
00:32:21,965 --> 00:32:23,205
He didn't know you.

517
00:32:23,845 --> 00:32:25,245
But you probably knew him.

518
00:32:26,765 --> 00:32:28,325
I made the first move on Mumu.

519
00:32:37,525 --> 00:32:39,805
We can talk about your love story later.

520
00:32:39,885 --> 00:32:42,285
Let's eat before the food gets cold.

521
00:32:42,365 --> 00:32:44,485
That's right. Have some more, Mumu.

522
00:32:48,645 --> 00:32:50,805
Here. Mumu loves to eat garlic.

523
00:33:07,845 --> 00:33:09,285
Why did you say those things?

524
00:33:09,925 --> 00:33:10,885
I don't like her.

525
00:33:11,845 --> 00:33:12,685
Why not?

526
00:33:15,085 --> 00:33:15,925
Ling.

527
00:33:16,365 --> 00:33:19,165
She seems simple and innocuous.
She doesn't ask for anything.

528
00:33:19,725 --> 00:33:22,205
But she's just playing dumb.

529
00:33:22,845 --> 00:33:23,765
Think about it.

530
00:33:24,085 --> 00:33:25,605
If you get caught up in her charm,

531
00:33:25,685 --> 00:33:27,405
she will reveal her true colors.

532
00:33:27,645 --> 00:33:29,525
I've seen so many women
like this in showbiz.

533
00:33:29,605 --> 00:33:32,125
They'd do anything
to climb their way up ladder.

534
00:33:33,165 --> 00:33:35,725
That's why I want you to think carefully.
Don't be fooled by her.

535
00:33:37,445 --> 00:33:38,285
What's so funny?

536
00:33:38,805 --> 00:33:40,565
When have you ever seen me be fooled?

537
00:33:41,445 --> 00:33:43,325
I'm not worried about anything else.

538
00:33:43,405 --> 00:33:45,645
But when it comes to women,
you're a blank sheet of paper.

539
00:33:45,925 --> 00:33:47,885
Maybe you'll be overwhelmed by desire.

540
00:33:47,965 --> 00:33:49,165
-And then you'll--
-I won't.

541
00:33:52,005 --> 00:33:54,765
Getting married is a decision I made
after thorough consideration.

542
00:33:57,885 --> 00:33:59,725
Do you know what she's like in private?

543
00:34:01,445 --> 00:34:02,805
Whatever she's like, I'll like it.

544
00:34:03,725 --> 00:34:05,765
I think someone's put a spell on you.

545
00:34:06,125 --> 00:34:07,325
If she cast the spell...

546
00:34:09,285 --> 00:34:10,325
I'll take it.

547
00:34:19,325 --> 00:34:21,365
<i>The hopeless romantic.</i>

548
00:34:21,445 --> 00:34:24,204
<i>When he's in love, he becomes obsessed.</i>

549
00:34:26,325 --> 00:34:28,565
<i>I'll find a way to expose her.</i>

550
00:34:33,204 --> 00:34:35,125
Chu Yan, we should go home.

551
00:34:35,204 --> 00:34:36,965
No... I'm too drunk.

552
00:34:37,045 --> 00:34:38,125
I have to stay the night.

553
00:34:38,445 --> 00:34:40,005
I need to sleep. My head hurts.

554
00:34:41,005 --> 00:34:42,085
We don't have a guest room.

555
00:34:42,765 --> 00:34:43,805
I can sleep on the couch.

556
00:34:44,365 --> 00:34:45,605
My head!

557
00:34:47,365 --> 00:34:49,644
The curfew in my house is 10 p.m.
It's 9:30 now.

558
00:34:49,724 --> 00:34:52,365
You have half an hour to sober up
before you leave.

559
00:34:53,005 --> 00:34:53,845
Curfew?

560
00:34:54,285 --> 00:34:55,684
I didn't know about that.

561
00:34:56,885 --> 00:34:57,925
Now you know.

562
00:35:00,605 --> 00:35:02,125
Oh, my stomach...

563
00:35:02,445 --> 00:35:03,765
I need to use the bathroom.

564
00:35:35,645 --> 00:35:37,485
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

565
00:35:39,045 --> 00:35:41,405
<i>In the tiny bathroom,</i>

566
00:35:42,285 --> 00:35:46,965
<i>the tension between them</i>
<i>will be unbearable.</i>

567
00:35:56,605 --> 00:35:58,845
Linlin. Linlin.

568
00:36:00,725 --> 00:36:02,165
Yes, Miss An?

569
00:36:02,525 --> 00:36:03,725
Just call me An Ran.

570
00:36:04,045 --> 00:36:06,885
I grew up with Yizhou.

571
00:36:06,965 --> 00:36:09,605
I've always been curious
about what kind of girl he likes.

572
00:36:11,405 --> 00:36:14,005
You didn't think it would be me, right?
I was surprised, too.

573
00:36:14,325 --> 00:36:17,805
Perhaps we all fall for someone
who's different from us.

574
00:36:18,125 --> 00:36:19,765
It keeps things fresh and exciting.

575
00:36:22,285 --> 00:36:24,245
<i>Too bad Ling Yizhou likes</i>

576
00:36:24,325 --> 00:36:26,645
<i>a man who's different from him.</i>

577
00:36:27,645 --> 00:36:28,605
Stop causing trouble.

578
00:36:29,525 --> 00:36:30,805
I thought we were buddies.

579
00:36:33,005 --> 00:36:36,565
Yizhou is a picky eater.
He also has some little quirks.

580
00:36:36,965 --> 00:36:38,725
You can ask me
if you don't know what to do.

581
00:36:39,325 --> 00:36:41,725
It's OK. I won't trouble you.
I'll just ask him.

582
00:36:43,685 --> 00:36:44,965
Sounds good.

583
00:36:45,285 --> 00:36:48,285
By the way,
I don't have many friends here.

584
00:36:48,845 --> 00:36:51,405
If I want to go shopping,
can I give you a call?

585
00:36:51,925 --> 00:36:53,125
Sure. No problem.

586
00:36:53,685 --> 00:36:54,765
What's no problem?

587
00:36:59,245 --> 00:37:01,685
Chu Yan is sober now.
An Ran, you can go with him now.

588
00:37:02,525 --> 00:37:04,845
OK, Yizhou. We'll get going.

589
00:37:08,245 --> 00:37:09,605
Don't forget what you promised.

590
00:37:24,565 --> 00:37:25,485
Stop drinking.

591
00:37:26,045 --> 00:37:27,685
Drowning in sorrow doesn't suit you.

592
00:37:29,805 --> 00:37:31,805
Chu Yan, let me tell you something.

593
00:37:33,365 --> 00:37:37,365
Since I was a child, I've always gotten...

594
00:37:38,605 --> 00:37:39,645
everything I want.

595
00:37:41,485 --> 00:37:42,405
That's why...

596
00:37:45,445 --> 00:37:46,925
it will be the same this time.

597
00:37:47,925 --> 00:37:51,125
He will be mine eventually.

598
00:37:52,205 --> 00:37:55,045
You think Ling is a barbie doll

599
00:37:55,125 --> 00:37:56,565
that you can just buy with money?

600
00:37:57,045 --> 00:37:58,725
Stop wasting your time.

601
00:37:59,045 --> 00:38:01,205
He's harder to conquer than Mount Everest.

602
00:38:01,725 --> 00:38:03,525
Maybe we should make do with each other.

603
00:38:05,885 --> 00:38:06,885
Chu Yan.

604
00:38:08,005 --> 00:38:09,605
You've never liked anyone before, right?

605
00:38:10,365 --> 00:38:12,005
There are many people who like me.

606
00:38:12,085 --> 00:38:14,805
If I choose someone,
many people will be heartbroken, OK?

607
00:38:15,605 --> 00:38:16,765
That's why you don't get it.

608
00:38:17,805 --> 00:38:19,325
Love is not about making do.

609
00:38:20,085 --> 00:38:22,685
It's the one and only.

610
00:38:37,485 --> 00:38:42,205
Ling Yizhou, you can only be mine.

611
00:38:58,845 --> 00:39:02,365
<i>You just got married</i>
<i>and you have two rivals already?</i>

612
00:39:04,085 --> 00:39:08,725
Mr. Ling's good looks are off the chart.
Both guys and girls like him.

613
00:39:09,805 --> 00:39:11,765
Sometimes I'm confused.

614
00:39:12,445 --> 00:39:15,085
He's like a straight guy in some ways.

615
00:39:17,405 --> 00:39:19,085
Have you already...

616
00:39:20,685 --> 00:39:23,245
<i>Hey... we're just roommates.</i>

617
00:39:23,965 --> 00:39:26,125
<i>It's just a feeling I have.</i>

618
00:39:28,565 --> 00:39:29,965
It's easy to find out.

619
00:39:30,285 --> 00:39:31,405
Just give him a test.

620
00:39:32,965 --> 00:39:34,085
How?

621
00:39:59,885 --> 00:40:00,845
What are you doing?

622
00:40:05,845 --> 00:40:08,405
Want to watch TV together?

623
00:40:18,645 --> 00:40:19,565
Are you cold?

624
00:40:22,365 --> 00:40:23,445
I said, are you cold?

625
00:40:25,605 --> 00:40:29,045
First of all, they're not
interested in women at all.

626
00:40:29,445 --> 00:40:31,805
Even if you stripped naked
in front of him,

627
00:40:31,885 --> 00:40:34,445
he wouldn't even look at you.

628
00:40:38,725 --> 00:40:39,765
Let's go watch TV then.

629
00:40:56,485 --> 00:40:58,085
What do you think of the male actors?

630
00:40:58,645 --> 00:41:01,885
Second, they often comment on other men.

631
00:41:05,565 --> 00:41:07,085
They're all quite handsome.

632
00:41:07,565 --> 00:41:09,365
I think Chu Yan is the most handsome.

633
00:41:11,085 --> 00:41:14,685
<i>Beauty truly is</i>
<i>in the eye of the beholder.</i>

634
00:41:17,725 --> 00:41:19,285
If you still have doubts,

635
00:41:19,765 --> 00:41:22,805
the ultimate trick is to get him drunk.

636
00:41:23,205 --> 00:41:26,285
Then, you can ask him whatever you want.

637
00:41:28,685 --> 00:41:30,045
Do we have any alcohol at home?

638
00:41:30,125 --> 00:41:31,005
You drink?

639
00:41:32,325 --> 00:41:33,445
Not to blow my own horn,

640
00:41:33,525 --> 00:41:35,365
but I can drink a lot.

641
00:41:45,885 --> 00:41:50,365
See? What did I tell you?

642
00:41:51,485 --> 00:41:52,325
Good.

643
00:41:53,645 --> 00:41:57,445
I'll ask you one last question.

644
00:41:59,725 --> 00:42:02,565
Do you like Chu Yan?

645
00:42:04,365 --> 00:42:06,045
-Or Wen Li?
-What do you mean?

646
00:42:06,685 --> 00:42:10,045
It's OK. You can tell me your secret.

647
00:42:10,845 --> 00:42:14,725
I won't tell anyone.

648
00:42:15,765 --> 00:42:16,645
Besides,

649
00:42:17,045 --> 00:42:20,325
I'll respect your personal orientation.

650
00:42:21,765 --> 00:42:22,845
Who told you that?

651
00:42:25,165 --> 00:42:26,445
I guessed.

652
00:42:27,965 --> 00:42:32,765
You're a neat freak. You don't smoke.
You have good taste.

653
00:42:34,005 --> 00:42:37,965
And you're not interested in women.

654
00:42:40,605 --> 00:42:42,805
Who says I'm not interested in women?

655
00:42:45,165 --> 00:42:46,565
Are you?

656
00:42:47,085 --> 00:42:49,405
I'll gladly prove you wrong.

00:43:23,965 --> 00:43:24,965
Keep up the good work.

658
00:43:25,205 --> 00:43:26,925
Yes, sir. I'll do my best.

00:45:06,325 --> 00:45:07,205
What are you doing?

661
00:45:07,285 --> 00:45:08,685
This is necessary for our act.

662
00:45:09,405 --> 00:45:10,765
Grandma would be suspicious.

I heard you know
Director Ling's housekeeper.

00:45:19,245 --> 00:45:21,245
I'm going to shower.
Would you like to join me?

00:45:27,005 --> 00:45:30,805
Did he just flirt with me?

667
00:45:31,205 --> 00:45:33,045
-I can keep our marriage secret.
-Really?

668
00:45:33,125 --> 00:45:34,285
But I have one condition.
