1
00:00:13,005 --> 00:00:14,925
Someone has been covering up
Nan Jintian's tracks.

2
00:00:15,005 --> 00:00:18,125
Could this slip-up be an intentional clue
they were leaving us?

3
00:00:18,205 --> 00:00:19,565
I have to thank you.

4
00:00:20,085 --> 00:00:21,565
You added a lot of dramatic effect

5
00:00:22,085 --> 00:00:24,085
to this play I'm directing right now.

6
00:00:24,485 --> 00:00:26,205
You let them find us on purpose.

7
00:00:28,965 --> 00:00:30,165
Why did you lock the door?

8
00:00:31,245 --> 00:00:32,165
Xia Lin.

9
00:00:32,645 --> 00:00:35,405
Why do you have the courage
to keep testing my limits?

10
00:00:35,805 --> 00:00:37,164
Because we're friends.

11
00:00:37,245 --> 00:00:38,685
From what I know,

12
00:00:39,125 --> 00:00:42,605
he's probably doing this
to avenge his biological mother.

13
00:00:42,965 --> 00:00:46,725
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

14
00:02:13,605 --> 00:02:16,325
EPISODE 19

15
00:02:36,645 --> 00:02:38,125
-Mumu.
-Xia Lin.

16
00:02:38,205 --> 00:02:39,565
-Mumu.
-Are you OK?

17
00:02:40,205 --> 00:02:42,205
I'm fine.

18
00:02:42,645 --> 00:02:43,645
That's good.

19
00:02:44,445 --> 00:02:46,605
Mumu, how is Yizhou doing?

20
00:02:47,725 --> 00:02:48,925
They're still operating on him.

21
00:02:49,445 --> 00:02:51,205
What happened?

22
00:02:53,445 --> 00:02:54,845
Nan Jintian tried to kill me.

23
00:02:56,285 --> 00:02:57,125
Yizhou...

24
00:02:58,565 --> 00:02:59,685
Yizhou took a bullet for me.

25
00:03:01,445 --> 00:03:02,445
How could this be?

26
00:03:03,005 --> 00:03:05,565
I'm sorry. Please have a seat.

27
00:03:13,725 --> 00:03:14,565
Mumu.

28
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:16,525
It's not your fault.

29
00:03:17,485 --> 00:03:19,125
He's your husband.

30
00:03:19,805 --> 00:03:21,685
He's supposed to protect you.

31
00:03:22,925 --> 00:03:25,725
Yan told me you were pregnant.

32
00:03:26,605 --> 00:03:28,765
You've suffered all this time.

33
00:03:29,685 --> 00:03:32,045
I'm not afraid of suffering.

34
00:03:33,245 --> 00:03:36,645
I just want Yizhou to be OK.

35
00:03:38,245 --> 00:03:41,925
Don't worry. Yizhou will be OK.

36
00:03:56,405 --> 00:03:58,645
Xia Lin, eat something.

37
00:04:03,485 --> 00:04:04,325
Where's Grandma?

38
00:04:04,405 --> 00:04:05,605
She had dinner and went to bed.

39
00:04:06,325 --> 00:04:08,365
She was feeling tired because of her age.

40
00:04:15,645 --> 00:04:17,645
Linlin, you can't continue like this.

41
00:04:17,925 --> 00:04:19,045
You're not alone anymore.

42
00:04:19,565 --> 00:04:21,284
You have to think about your baby.

43
00:04:22,325 --> 00:04:25,685
If you collapse too,
Grandma will be devastated.

44
00:04:27,245 --> 00:04:28,205
Have some water.

45
00:04:36,085 --> 00:04:36,925
Are you OK?

46
00:04:39,005 --> 00:04:40,125
I'm fine.

47
00:04:40,845 --> 00:04:45,525
I've been eating and sleeping well.

48
00:04:45,965 --> 00:04:47,205
I'm healthy.

49
00:04:49,365 --> 00:04:52,885
Don't worry about me.

50
00:04:53,365 --> 00:04:54,565
How can we not be worried?

51
00:04:55,645 --> 00:04:57,565
You don't look well at all.

52
00:05:01,485 --> 00:05:03,885
-I'll wait for Yizhou to come out.
-Hello?

53
00:05:04,885 --> 00:05:06,165
If he's OK...

54
00:05:07,685 --> 00:05:09,485
I'll go home and rest.

55
00:05:11,725 --> 00:05:12,565
OK?

56
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:14,365
-But...
-OK.

57
00:05:15,765 --> 00:05:17,125
Mr. Wang just called.

58
00:05:17,645 --> 00:05:20,405
Nan Jintian's car fell into the sea
as he was getting away.

59
00:05:20,765 --> 00:05:22,405
They don't know if he's alive or not.

60
00:05:23,605 --> 00:05:24,525
He deserves it.

61
00:05:30,245 --> 00:05:31,365
Doctor, how is he doing?

62
00:05:31,925 --> 00:05:33,125
We've removed the bullet.

63
00:05:33,205 --> 00:05:35,725
However, Director Ling's vital signs
are still unstable.

64
00:05:36,845 --> 00:05:38,365
We need to keep him under observation.

65
00:05:39,485 --> 00:05:40,645
You're saying that...

66
00:05:41,925 --> 00:05:43,725
he's still in critical condition.

67
00:05:44,325 --> 00:05:45,765
I'm sorry, Mrs. Ling.

68
00:05:46,325 --> 00:05:47,725
When will he regain consciousness?

69
00:05:49,645 --> 00:05:50,685
We don't know for sure.

70
00:05:51,405 --> 00:05:52,965
He's lost a lot of blood,

71
00:05:53,765 --> 00:05:55,405
which caused a hemorrhagic shock.

72
00:05:55,885 --> 00:05:57,485
He's still in a coma.

73
00:05:58,845 --> 00:06:01,965
This will continue for quite some time.

74
00:06:02,045 --> 00:06:03,085
That's not true.

75
00:06:05,005 --> 00:06:07,165
I'm so sorry. We've done our best.

76
00:06:13,605 --> 00:06:15,085
Linlin...

77
00:06:15,525 --> 00:06:16,965
Linlin...

78
00:06:25,445 --> 00:06:26,325
Yizhou...

79
00:06:27,365 --> 00:06:28,245
Yizhou...

80
00:06:29,685 --> 00:06:32,285
No... No!

81
00:06:33,445 --> 00:06:35,045
Mumu, you're awake.

82
00:06:37,285 --> 00:06:38,285
Take it slow.

83
00:06:43,165 --> 00:06:44,205
It's daytime.

84
00:06:45,805 --> 00:06:47,925
Grandma, where's Yizhou?

85
00:06:48,685 --> 00:06:50,765
He's in his room now.

86
00:06:51,045 --> 00:06:53,845
But he's still unconscious.

87
00:06:55,325 --> 00:06:56,405
What are you doing?

88
00:06:56,605 --> 00:06:57,645
I want to see him.

89
00:06:58,285 --> 00:07:01,045
No. You're pregnant.

90
00:07:01,605 --> 00:07:04,565
You have to take care of yourself first
before you take care of him.

91
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:06,765
But...

92
00:07:07,965 --> 00:07:09,685
I know you're worried about Yizhou.

93
00:07:09,965 --> 00:07:11,525
But I hope that

94
00:07:11,925 --> 00:07:16,045
both of you can be safe and healthy.

95
00:07:16,765 --> 00:07:18,405
That's more important than anything.

96
00:07:19,245 --> 00:07:20,365
Promise me.

97
00:07:21,085 --> 00:07:23,685
You need to take care of yourself
and the baby.

98
00:07:24,245 --> 00:07:26,645
Don't let me worry about you, OK?

99
00:07:26,725 --> 00:07:27,765
OK.

100
00:07:28,325 --> 00:07:31,685
Here. Sit down.

101
00:07:32,005 --> 00:07:33,965
I'll get you something to eat.

102
00:07:50,085 --> 00:07:53,845
Yizhou, I'm here to see you.

103
00:07:54,925 --> 00:07:57,205
I know you can hear me.

104
00:07:59,685 --> 00:08:01,405
The baby and I are waiting for you.

105
00:08:04,445 --> 00:08:06,245
Wake up, OK?

106
00:08:26,245 --> 00:08:27,085
Ling Yizhou...

107
00:08:27,805 --> 00:08:28,725
Ling Yizhou!

108
00:08:28,805 --> 00:08:30,125
Ling Yizhou!

109
00:08:31,725 --> 00:08:32,685
Ling Yizhou!

110
00:08:32,925 --> 00:08:35,365
Please leave now.
We need to work on the patient.

111
00:08:38,405 --> 00:08:40,924
-His heart has stopped. Get the AED ready.
-OK.

112
00:08:45,924 --> 00:08:47,285
Charge. Stand clear.

113
00:08:48,044 --> 00:08:49,085
-Clear.
-Clear.

114
00:08:51,365 --> 00:08:53,165
-What's his heart rate?
-72. Blood pressure 98.

115
00:08:54,845 --> 00:08:55,845
Charge.

116
00:08:56,485 --> 00:08:58,445
-Clear.
-Heart rate 70. Blood pressure 98.

117
00:08:59,125 --> 00:09:00,925
-Pulse.
-72.

118
00:09:10,685 --> 00:09:13,365
That's for doubting our friendship.

119
00:09:13,805 --> 00:09:15,765
I believe you.
You're like a brother to me.

120
00:09:16,405 --> 00:09:17,565
That will never change.

121
00:09:18,405 --> 00:09:19,405
That will never change.

122
00:09:55,525 --> 00:09:56,365
Ling Yizhou.

123
00:09:58,445 --> 00:10:00,925
You promised you'd never leave me.

124
00:10:06,445 --> 00:10:07,885
Please wake up.

125
00:10:09,805 --> 00:10:11,925
Please, wake up.

126
00:10:14,965 --> 00:10:15,805
Mumu.

127
00:10:17,005 --> 00:10:17,965
Don't cry.

128
00:10:32,285 --> 00:10:35,565
GANGDONG INTERNATIONAL MEDICAL CENTER
OPERATING ROOM

129
00:10:54,645 --> 00:10:56,165
How is he doing, doctor?

130
00:10:56,725 --> 00:10:58,245
He has a strong will to survive.

131
00:10:58,525 --> 00:10:59,925
We were able to save him.

132
00:11:01,405 --> 00:11:03,445
However, he stopped breathing
for a moment.

133
00:11:03,845 --> 00:11:05,805
That has caused brain damage again.

134
00:11:06,645 --> 00:11:09,165
You have to be prepared.

135
00:11:14,125 --> 00:11:15,045
Xia Lin.

136
00:11:16,005 --> 00:11:18,125
Ling has survived through it all.

137
00:11:18,405 --> 00:11:20,165
He's stronger than most people.

138
00:11:20,885 --> 00:11:22,285
He will be fine.

139
00:11:25,125 --> 00:11:28,005
Dr. Wang, tell me the truth.

140
00:11:28,925 --> 00:11:30,365
Will he wake up?

141
00:11:33,005 --> 00:11:35,885
It's possible, but it would be a miracle.

142
00:11:36,605 --> 00:11:38,285
As for the probability for a miracle...

143
00:11:41,045 --> 00:11:43,045
How can we trigger the miracle?

144
00:11:43,685 --> 00:11:44,765
I can't say for sure.

145
00:11:44,845 --> 00:11:48,085
Maybe an emotional trigger
or physical stimulation.

146
00:11:49,845 --> 00:11:52,725
There's no specific medical definition
for a miracle.

147
00:11:53,805 --> 00:11:54,645
So...

148
00:11:55,885 --> 00:11:58,365
I understand. Thank you.

149
00:12:07,365 --> 00:12:08,885
You both go home and rest.

150
00:12:09,605 --> 00:12:11,405
No. I want to stay here with you.

151
00:12:11,965 --> 00:12:13,005
That's right.

152
00:12:13,085 --> 00:12:15,605
If you can stay up when you're pregnant,
we can too.

153
00:12:16,045 --> 00:12:16,885
I'm fine.

154
00:12:18,645 --> 00:12:20,605
Xia Lin, cry if you want.

155
00:12:21,365 --> 00:12:22,445
I'll lend you my shoulder.

156
00:12:23,925 --> 00:12:25,445
Don't force yourself to smile.

157
00:12:25,725 --> 00:12:27,325
Ling wouldn't want to see you like this.

158
00:12:27,845 --> 00:12:28,925
I'm fine, really.

159
00:12:29,645 --> 00:12:30,885
The doctor said it.

160
00:12:31,445 --> 00:12:32,965
He has a strong will to survive.

161
00:12:33,805 --> 00:12:38,005
He's fighting so hard for his life.

162
00:12:38,485 --> 00:12:42,205
How can I complain and be discouraged?

163
00:12:45,925 --> 00:12:46,885
Where are you going?

164
00:12:48,245 --> 00:12:49,485
I'm going to get examined.

165
00:12:51,165 --> 00:12:54,045
If the baby is OK, and I'm OK,

166
00:12:54,525 --> 00:12:55,805
he'll be fine, too.

167
00:12:57,325 --> 00:12:58,885
We're waiting for a miracle.

168
00:12:59,365 --> 00:13:01,205
As long as we stay together as a family...

169
00:13:02,445 --> 00:13:04,045
it will happen for sure.

170
00:13:04,285 --> 00:13:05,245
I'll come with you.

171
00:13:15,525 --> 00:13:18,445
<i>Ling, you have to get better.</i>

172
00:13:22,165 --> 00:13:24,445
GANGDONG MEDICAL CENTER
GANGDONG MINGZHOU HOSPITAL

173
00:15:02,485 --> 00:15:03,565
-You're home.
-Yes.

174
00:15:03,645 --> 00:15:05,965
Mr. Fu, Yan is back.
You can start preparing dinner now.

175
00:15:07,525 --> 00:15:10,725
I told you so many times, old man.
Don't wait for me.

176
00:15:13,405 --> 00:15:14,405
How's Ling Yizhou?

177
00:15:14,885 --> 00:15:17,405
He's still in a coma.
No sign of waking up.

178
00:15:17,845 --> 00:15:21,845
So Wen Li is managing Lingshi Group now?

179
00:15:22,165 --> 00:15:24,045
I guess so. I'm not sure.

180
00:15:27,445 --> 00:15:30,845
Why are you suddenly interested
in Lingshi Group?

181
00:15:31,685 --> 00:15:33,365
Are you trying to play tricks?

182
00:15:34,485 --> 00:15:38,405
Is this how you talk to your father?

183
00:15:38,485 --> 00:15:39,405
You'd better not be.

184
00:15:40,485 --> 00:15:43,325
I don't care about
your business wrangling.

185
00:15:43,405 --> 00:15:44,445
Ling is my brother.

186
00:15:44,925 --> 00:15:48,645
I won't let anyone attack him
while he's down.

187
00:15:49,525 --> 00:15:52,285
I'm afraid someone is trying to do that.

188
00:15:53,685 --> 00:15:54,765
What do you mean?

189
00:15:56,525 --> 00:16:01,085
Lingshi's shareholders want the board
to remove Ling Yizhou as CEO.

190
00:16:01,765 --> 00:16:03,325
The shareholder meeting is in one week.

191
00:16:04,085 --> 00:16:05,045
What?

192
00:16:05,125 --> 00:16:06,445
I heard that

193
00:16:06,525 --> 00:16:09,085
some people are buying out
Lingshi Group's penny stocks.

194
00:16:10,325 --> 00:16:11,285
Those bastards.

195
00:16:11,805 --> 00:16:13,645
They're already trying
to take over the company.

196
00:16:14,125 --> 00:16:15,805
I need to let Wen Li know right now.

197
00:16:16,165 --> 00:16:17,125
Finish your meal first.

198
00:16:17,365 --> 00:16:18,885
-I have no appetite.
-You...

199
00:16:27,565 --> 00:16:28,405
Mrs. Ling.

200
00:16:28,645 --> 00:16:30,085
I know it's been hard for you.

201
00:16:30,485 --> 00:16:32,205
Rushing between the company
and the hospital.

202
00:16:32,285 --> 00:16:33,685
This is my duty.

203
00:16:33,765 --> 00:16:35,645
It's even harder for you, Mrs. Ling.

204
00:16:36,685 --> 00:16:39,845
It's all worth it
as long as he gets better.

205
00:16:40,285 --> 00:16:41,125
Have a seat.

206
00:16:46,325 --> 00:16:47,805
What do you want to talk to me about?

207
00:16:49,365 --> 00:16:50,805
There are two things.

208
00:16:51,085 --> 00:16:52,685
One is about Nan Jintian.

209
00:16:53,045 --> 00:16:53,885
They found him?

210
00:16:54,565 --> 00:16:56,285
The police found a body downstream.

211
00:16:56,725 --> 00:16:59,765
The body has been in the water
too long to be identified.

212
00:17:00,885 --> 00:17:02,805
But based on the clothing, IDs,

213
00:17:03,125 --> 00:17:04,485
and physical features,

214
00:17:04,565 --> 00:17:06,445
they think it's Nan Jintian.

215
00:17:07,405 --> 00:17:10,245
The DNA test will take some time.

216
00:17:12,045 --> 00:17:13,844
Even if he has escaped and survived,

217
00:17:14,245 --> 00:17:16,525
he will receive the death sentence
if they catch him.

218
00:17:16,604 --> 00:17:19,565
The police reopened the investigation
based on Yang Tong's statement.

219
00:17:20,084 --> 00:17:22,525
The driver of the car accident
was sent by Nan Jintian.

220
00:17:23,205 --> 00:17:25,725
He's also behind the arson case.

221
00:17:27,245 --> 00:17:28,405
An Ran was obviously used.

222
00:17:28,765 --> 00:17:29,604
Yes.

223
00:17:31,245 --> 00:17:32,165
And Yang Tong?

224
00:17:33,205 --> 00:17:34,925
She was the mastermind of the arson fire.

225
00:17:35,645 --> 00:17:38,645
She also helped Nan Jintian
plan the abduction

226
00:17:39,205 --> 00:17:40,165
as well as the murder.

227
00:17:41,045 --> 00:17:42,845
She's still waiting for her sentence,

228
00:17:43,205 --> 00:17:46,365
but she'll most likely spend
the rest of her life in jail.

229
00:17:48,765 --> 00:17:50,205
She's still so young.

230
00:17:50,645 --> 00:17:53,085
It was her choice, Mrs. Ling.

231
00:17:54,845 --> 00:17:58,885
This whole thing
has finally come to an end.

232
00:17:59,925 --> 00:18:02,685
You said there were two things.

233
00:18:04,325 --> 00:18:05,885
The second thing is that

234
00:18:05,965 --> 00:18:08,085
the special shareholder meeting
will be held in a week.

235
00:18:09,045 --> 00:18:12,245
They're proposing to remove
Director Ling from the board.

236
00:18:12,325 --> 00:18:13,205
What?

237
00:18:13,685 --> 00:18:17,365
Chu Yan called me today and said someone
has been buying our penny stocks.

238
00:18:18,085 --> 00:18:20,525
People are getting anxious.

239
00:18:20,605 --> 00:18:23,005
Wait. You mean that

240
00:18:23,525 --> 00:18:26,165
someone wants to take over Lingshi

241
00:18:26,725 --> 00:18:28,285
while Ling Yizhou is unconscious?

242
00:18:28,365 --> 00:18:29,245
Yes.

243
00:18:34,525 --> 00:18:35,525
-Mrs. Ling.
-Linlin.

244
00:18:36,045 --> 00:18:37,365
You're pregnant.

245
00:18:37,445 --> 00:18:39,365
You can leave these things to Ms. Huang.

246
00:18:39,685 --> 00:18:40,965
I'm not that weak.

247
00:18:41,645 --> 00:18:43,805
And Ms. Huang is with grandma.

248
00:18:44,365 --> 00:18:45,205
Mrs. Ling.

249
00:18:45,485 --> 00:18:48,125
I asked you to come
because I wanted to ask you something.

250
00:18:48,325 --> 00:18:49,165
What is it?

251
00:18:54,325 --> 00:18:55,445
Did you want to ask why

252
00:18:55,765 --> 00:18:58,285
I haven't come to see Yizhou in a while?

253
00:19:00,365 --> 00:19:03,245
You know we will have
a special shareholder meeting soon, right?

254
00:19:04,725 --> 00:19:05,885
Wen Li told me.

255
00:19:08,125 --> 00:19:11,045
After the news of Yizhou
being in a coma got out,

256
00:19:11,125 --> 00:19:13,885
people were worried,
and the stock price plummeted.

257
00:19:14,885 --> 00:19:17,365
Some people are even trying to grab power.

258
00:19:18,045 --> 00:19:22,125
I can't let Yizhou
and his father's hard work be stolen.

259
00:19:23,245 --> 00:19:26,245
I've been contacting board members.

260
00:19:26,565 --> 00:19:28,725
I want to get more support for Yizhou.

261
00:19:29,685 --> 00:19:32,365
I see. Have you had any success?

262
00:19:34,525 --> 00:19:35,965
I have been abroad for too long.

263
00:19:36,525 --> 00:19:40,405
It's hard to persuade
the old-timers on the board.

264
00:19:41,205 --> 00:19:43,805
What can I do to help?

265
00:19:44,325 --> 00:19:45,165
Linlin.

266
00:19:45,645 --> 00:19:48,205
I know I shouldn't bother you
at this time.

267
00:19:49,005 --> 00:19:51,965
But I do need a copy
of the list of shareholders.

268
00:19:53,045 --> 00:19:56,965
This way, I can get more
board members on our side.

269
00:19:58,045 --> 00:20:01,125
I couldn't find the list at the office.

270
00:20:01,925 --> 00:20:04,925
Maybe Yizhou left it in the house?

271
00:20:06,285 --> 00:20:08,325
Maybe. I'll go look.

272
00:20:09,565 --> 00:20:10,485
By the way,

273
00:20:10,765 --> 00:20:12,925
I don't know what the list looks like.

274
00:20:13,005 --> 00:20:14,365
Maybe you can come with me.

275
00:20:14,765 --> 00:20:15,605
OK.

276
00:20:17,005 --> 00:20:17,845
Let's go.

277
00:20:30,245 --> 00:20:31,845
I couldn't find it.

278
00:20:32,165 --> 00:20:34,645
Keep looking. It's an important document.

279
00:20:34,725 --> 00:20:37,285
Maybe Yizhou stored it in a hidden place.

280
00:20:39,125 --> 00:20:40,365
How could I forget?

281
00:20:40,445 --> 00:20:42,885
Wait a moment. I'll look in the safe.

282
00:21:18,405 --> 00:21:20,365
I can't find it in the safe either.

283
00:21:22,285 --> 00:21:24,245
It's OK. I'll think of other ways.

284
00:21:24,725 --> 00:21:26,365
I can call Wen Li and ask him.

285
00:21:26,685 --> 00:21:28,085
-Maybe he knows.
-It's fine.

286
00:21:29,765 --> 00:21:31,165
Get some rest.

287
00:21:31,685 --> 00:21:33,445
Don't worry about any of this.

288
00:21:33,525 --> 00:21:36,045
I'll take care of it. I'll call Wen Li.

289
00:21:36,645 --> 00:21:37,485
OK.

290
00:21:40,005 --> 00:21:42,365
Yizhou is an adult.
Is he still playing with this kind of toy?

291
00:21:43,125 --> 00:21:45,325
He didn't buy it. I gave it to him.

292
00:21:46,885 --> 00:21:47,765
No wonder.

293
00:21:49,005 --> 00:21:51,645
Don't you think it looks familiar?

294
00:21:54,605 --> 00:21:56,925
I don't know much about this kind of toy.

295
00:22:00,365 --> 00:22:02,565
I received word

296
00:22:03,005 --> 00:22:06,125
that someone has been meeting
with board members.

297
00:22:07,085 --> 00:22:09,165
In fact, we know this person.

298
00:22:09,445 --> 00:22:10,285
Who is it?

299
00:22:10,365 --> 00:22:11,445
Director Ling's mother.

300
00:22:15,525 --> 00:22:18,205
It's true I haven't seen her in days.

301
00:22:18,765 --> 00:22:20,325
Do you question her motive?

302
00:22:20,565 --> 00:22:22,205
Her behavior is suspicious.

303
00:22:24,085 --> 00:22:25,725
I haven't seen Yizhou in a while.

304
00:22:25,805 --> 00:22:27,405
I'll come with you later.

305
00:22:28,565 --> 00:22:31,485
Thank you. With what's happened,

306
00:22:31,565 --> 00:22:33,365
you're caught between
the Ling and Nan family.

307
00:22:33,885 --> 00:22:34,965
It must be hard for you.

308
00:22:35,485 --> 00:22:36,525
Don't say that.

309
00:22:37,605 --> 00:22:40,325
This whole thing is all my fault.

310
00:22:41,445 --> 00:22:44,125
Jintian is the one who caused all of this.

311
00:22:44,885 --> 00:22:47,525
His father called and asked me
to make amends the best I can.

312
00:22:49,405 --> 00:22:51,925
I shouldn't be saying all this.

313
00:22:52,005 --> 00:22:54,965
Please have a seat in the living room.
I'll go change.

314
00:22:55,365 --> 00:22:56,565
-OK.
-Let's go.

315
00:23:12,925 --> 00:23:16,445
LINGSHI GROUP CO. LTD.

316
00:23:17,245 --> 00:23:19,245
Linlin, what are you doing here?

317
00:23:19,925 --> 00:23:21,565
I'm Ling Yizhou's proxy.

318
00:23:22,885 --> 00:23:24,605
You can leave this to us.

319
00:23:25,205 --> 00:23:28,645
You should be at the hospital with Yizhou.

320
00:23:29,205 --> 00:23:31,685
I know you think you're winning.

321
00:23:32,085 --> 00:23:35,565
But I'm Yizhou's wife. I want to do
something for Lingshi Group, too.

322
00:23:36,005 --> 00:23:36,885
Don't you think?

323
00:23:37,845 --> 00:23:39,445
Ma'am, the voting is about to start.

324
00:23:40,845 --> 00:23:42,485
I'll go in now.

325
00:23:49,565 --> 00:23:53,365
Even if they know now, it's too late.
They will lose for sure.

326
00:24:20,445 --> 00:24:23,245
Yan, why are you here?
Where is Director Chu?

327
00:24:25,525 --> 00:24:29,045
The old man isn't feeling well,
so I'll be his proxy.

328
00:24:29,885 --> 00:24:32,685
We're casting the same vote anyway.

329
00:24:33,085 --> 00:24:35,445
It makes no difference
whether it's me or the old man.

330
00:24:44,605 --> 00:24:45,445
Grandma.

331
00:24:45,925 --> 00:24:49,965
Don't worry, Mumu.
No matter what the result is,

332
00:24:50,045 --> 00:24:51,245
we've done our best.

333
00:24:53,325 --> 00:24:56,125
Since everyone is here, let's begin.

334
00:25:12,245 --> 00:25:14,565
MOTION TO REMOVE
LINGSHI GROUP DIRECTOR, LING YIZHOU

335
00:25:18,485 --> 00:25:20,285
Thank you for attending the meeting.

336
00:25:20,525 --> 00:25:22,845
I'll make sure
you don't regret your choice today.

337
00:25:22,925 --> 00:25:24,605
After tomorrow's shareholder meeting,

338
00:25:24,685 --> 00:25:27,005
we will reach new agreements
for collaboration.

339
00:26:19,005 --> 00:26:21,805
MOTION TO REMOVE
LINGSHI GROUP DIRECTOR, LING YIZHOU

340
00:26:21,885 --> 00:26:23,525
AGAINST 56%, FOR 44%

341
00:26:25,565 --> 00:26:29,005
We won. Are you unhappy?

342
00:26:29,485 --> 00:26:30,725
You knew.

343
00:26:31,365 --> 00:26:32,205
That's right.

344
00:26:32,725 --> 00:26:35,485
I've wanted to ask you about it
since the day I found out.

345
00:26:35,565 --> 00:26:36,405
Why?

346
00:26:36,885 --> 00:26:41,245
Business is like war.
Business is business. No reason.

347
00:26:41,605 --> 00:26:43,925
As cruel as business may be,
family is still family.

348
00:26:44,445 --> 00:26:47,485
I could accept it if anyone else did this,
but not you.

349
00:26:48,485 --> 00:26:51,925
Nan Jintian retaliated against Yizhou
because of the mistake you made.

350
00:26:52,165 --> 00:26:53,365
He committed crimes for you.

351
00:26:54,365 --> 00:26:55,205
So,

352
00:26:55,525 --> 00:26:57,405
don't you owe me an explanation?

353
00:26:57,965 --> 00:26:59,685
Because I love Jintian's father.

354
00:27:02,205 --> 00:27:05,245
You can hurt the people
around you because of that?

355
00:27:06,885 --> 00:27:09,965
Your love is so great, so selfish.

356
00:27:11,765 --> 00:27:13,205
How did you find out?

357
00:27:13,605 --> 00:27:16,765
You did a good job putting on an act.

358
00:27:17,525 --> 00:27:19,885
But something gave you away.

359
00:27:20,605 --> 00:27:23,125
Don't you think it looks familiar?

360
00:27:26,085 --> 00:27:28,325
I don't know much about this kind of toy.

361
00:27:29,845 --> 00:27:33,365
That robot was
the parting gift you gave him.

362
00:27:34,285 --> 00:27:37,005
It was also the only gift
you ever gave him.

363
00:27:37,485 --> 00:27:40,685
It's impossible for a mother to forget.

364
00:27:43,445 --> 00:27:46,045
You doubted me over this one detail?

365
00:27:46,125 --> 00:27:49,285
Yes. This one thing says it all.

366
00:27:49,565 --> 00:27:51,725
You don't care about Yizhou at all.

367
00:27:52,925 --> 00:27:55,445
Regarding the list of shareholders,

368
00:27:55,965 --> 00:27:57,165
you never asked Wen Li, right?

369
00:27:58,205 --> 00:28:01,325
Because he would immediately question
your motive if you did.

370
00:28:02,445 --> 00:28:04,605
But it's OK. I asked him for you.

371
00:28:09,765 --> 00:28:13,485
So, we can confirm that Nantian Group
is behind all this.

372
00:28:13,805 --> 00:28:17,085
The companies that acquired penny stocks
are all linked to Nantian.

373
00:28:17,725 --> 00:28:20,485
Why did they buy the penny stocks?

374
00:28:20,925 --> 00:28:23,005
Penny stocks are purchased
through other companies.

375
00:28:23,405 --> 00:28:25,365
Then, Nantian can buy back these stocks

376
00:28:25,685 --> 00:28:27,285
at a low price on the market.

377
00:28:27,605 --> 00:28:31,205
This way, they will have a say
at the shareholder meeting.

378
00:28:32,605 --> 00:28:35,085
I remember Nan Jintian's father

379
00:28:35,405 --> 00:28:37,405
was forced out of the country by Mr. Ling.

380
00:28:38,125 --> 00:28:40,645
Afterwards, Nantian's business
has mostly moved overseas.

381
00:28:41,325 --> 00:28:45,125
They want to take this opportunity
to make a comeback

382
00:28:45,645 --> 00:28:47,125
and get revenge for Nan Jintian.

383
00:28:47,205 --> 00:28:48,045
No.

384
00:28:48,805 --> 00:28:51,725
Ling has an overwhelming majority
of shares.

385
00:28:52,325 --> 00:28:53,405
He used to.

386
00:28:53,485 --> 00:28:55,685
But Mrs. Nan is also a shareholder
of Lingshi Group.

387
00:28:56,445 --> 00:28:58,485
With the penny stocks
she's acquired lately,

388
00:28:58,565 --> 00:29:00,645
her shares are over 15%.

389
00:29:00,885 --> 00:29:03,845
She's also been in close contact
with board members.

390
00:29:04,285 --> 00:29:06,565
Her total shares are probably over 35%.

391
00:29:07,565 --> 00:29:08,885
Director Ling and Mrs. Ling

392
00:29:09,485 --> 00:29:11,445
only hold 29.7% of the shares.

393
00:29:13,165 --> 00:29:14,165
I remember that

394
00:29:14,645 --> 00:29:16,605
to dismiss a director from the board,

395
00:29:17,045 --> 00:29:19,485
over 50% of the votes are required
to pass the motion.

396
00:29:23,365 --> 00:29:24,405
What should we do now?

397
00:29:27,245 --> 00:29:29,205
This is the list of shareholders.

398
00:29:30,005 --> 00:29:31,565
I've been keeping it for Director Ling.

399
00:29:31,645 --> 00:29:33,005
The most important thing now

400
00:29:33,685 --> 00:29:36,925
is to find the medium
and small shareholders.

401
00:29:37,325 --> 00:29:40,685
We need to get
their power of attorney for the vote.

402
00:29:41,845 --> 00:29:42,685
I think

403
00:29:43,005 --> 00:29:46,325
that was why Mrs. Nan
asked you for the list.

404
00:29:48,925 --> 00:29:51,765
That's why I've been busy the whole week.

405
00:29:53,085 --> 00:29:55,165
You were preparing
to take over Lingshi Group.

406
00:29:55,645 --> 00:29:59,485
And I was working to protect Lingshi.

407
00:30:05,245 --> 00:30:08,605
Nan Jintian was so naive.

408
00:30:10,285 --> 00:30:13,285
He was fooled by you,
who pretended to care about him.

409
00:30:14,045 --> 00:30:16,285
He thought he could hurt you
by retaliating against Yizhou.

410
00:30:18,205 --> 00:30:19,925
In fact, we were all fooled by you.

411
00:30:21,165 --> 00:30:23,525
I regret asking people to be kind to you.

412
00:30:24,645 --> 00:30:25,885
You're a selfish person.

413
00:30:26,725 --> 00:30:28,285
You don't deserve to be a mother.

414
00:30:28,565 --> 00:30:31,445
You don't deserve his forgiveness.

415
00:30:46,165 --> 00:30:47,885
So? You won?

416
00:30:48,805 --> 00:30:49,645
Of course.

417
00:30:49,965 --> 00:30:52,445
How could I face you if I lost?

418
00:30:56,725 --> 00:30:59,285
I don't care who has a better chance
of winning. I'm asking you...

419
00:31:00,405 --> 00:31:01,765
who will you vote for tomorrow?

420
00:31:02,725 --> 00:31:06,685
Son, the company is failing.

421
00:31:07,925 --> 00:31:08,965
What do you mean?

422
00:31:10,325 --> 00:31:13,285
Your grandfather handed me a mess.

423
00:31:14,645 --> 00:31:16,805
I've been working so hard these years.

424
00:31:17,565 --> 00:31:19,205
But we're still suffering huge losses.

425
00:31:20,285 --> 00:31:22,685
Especially after being
economically blocked by Lingshi Group.

426
00:31:23,365 --> 00:31:25,925
The company's finances took a nosedive.

427
00:31:27,005 --> 00:31:28,245
If the situation persists,

428
00:31:29,205 --> 00:31:31,365
we will have to file for bankruptcy.

429
00:31:32,405 --> 00:31:35,445
That's why you forced me
to agree to an arranged marriage.

430
00:31:37,605 --> 00:31:39,725
I wanted to protect our family business.

431
00:31:40,445 --> 00:31:43,005
I was at the end of my rope.

432
00:31:56,005 --> 00:31:57,725
POWER OF ATTORNEY

433
00:31:57,805 --> 00:31:58,805
You should go tomorrow.

434
00:31:59,605 --> 00:32:00,885
Power of attorney?

435
00:32:01,365 --> 00:32:02,405
You're not helping Nantian?

436
00:32:03,325 --> 00:32:04,965
I was planning to.

437
00:32:05,365 --> 00:32:07,125
But I can't keep on making
the same mistakes.

438
00:32:08,165 --> 00:32:11,965
Compared to the company,
you matter to me even more.

439
00:32:16,965 --> 00:32:19,165
You can go now. Don't just stand there.

440
00:32:21,245 --> 00:32:24,165
Don't work too hard, old man.
You've got me.

441
00:32:25,045 --> 00:32:26,285
I can quit acting.

442
00:32:26,605 --> 00:32:28,645
I'll learn how to run
a business from Ling.

443
00:32:30,005 --> 00:32:33,805
I won't let the company go down.

444
00:32:47,885 --> 00:32:52,885
Yizhou, we got the results today.

445
00:32:54,605 --> 00:32:58,485
Guess whether we won or lost.

446
00:33:04,685 --> 00:33:06,245
You're right.

447
00:33:07,245 --> 00:33:10,125
You're still the director
of Lingshi Group.

448
00:33:11,765 --> 00:33:13,045
Let's give you a big hand.

449
00:33:25,285 --> 00:33:26,765
Will you please wake up?

450
00:33:29,005 --> 00:33:30,565
The baby and I miss you.

451
00:33:33,325 --> 00:33:34,845
Didn't you say...

452
00:33:36,245 --> 00:33:37,965
you'd agree to everything I want?

453
00:33:40,885 --> 00:33:42,285
I want you to wake up...

454
00:33:43,965 --> 00:33:45,125
right this moment.

455
00:34:04,525 --> 00:34:05,805
You failed again.

456
00:34:06,725 --> 00:34:08,405
You're such a liar, Ling Yizhou.

457
00:34:14,285 --> 00:34:18,644
Why do I still love you so much?

458
00:34:22,805 --> 00:34:23,885
Ling Yizhou.

459
00:34:25,925 --> 00:34:27,485
Will you please wake up?

460
00:34:33,244 --> 00:34:34,085
Fine.

461
00:34:36,085 --> 00:34:37,244
If you don't wake up...

462
00:34:38,325 --> 00:34:40,285
I'll shoot a kissing scene
with another man.

463
00:34:41,525 --> 00:34:43,164
I'll go on a blind date TV show.

464
00:34:44,244 --> 00:34:47,684
Your baby will call another man Daddy.

465
00:35:03,365 --> 00:35:04,325
Don't you dare...

466
00:35:10,885 --> 00:35:12,005
Why didn't you wake up then?

467
00:35:12,085 --> 00:35:13,685
Sorry... I forgot.

468
00:35:13,765 --> 00:35:15,365
I'll get the doctor.

469
00:35:16,525 --> 00:35:18,965
No. It's OK.

470
00:35:22,925 --> 00:35:24,005
You're a crybaby.

471
00:35:25,045 --> 00:35:26,565
Why do you keep crying?

472
00:35:27,045 --> 00:35:28,885
You never woke up.

473
00:35:32,325 --> 00:35:35,005
I'm sorry. It's my fault.

474
00:35:36,125 --> 00:35:37,165
You've no idea

475
00:35:38,085 --> 00:35:39,965
how afraid I've been.

476
00:35:41,125 --> 00:35:43,805
I was so scared you'd never wake up.

477
00:35:44,685 --> 00:35:45,685
Don't be afraid.

478
00:35:47,965 --> 00:35:49,205
How can I

479
00:35:49,805 --> 00:35:52,485
leave my Mumu alone in this world?

480
00:35:55,725 --> 00:35:57,565
I have to earn money to support Mumu.

481
00:36:04,165 --> 00:36:08,805
Ling Yizhou, I missed you so much.

482
00:36:20,005 --> 00:36:21,325
I missed you so much, too.

483
00:36:23,605 --> 00:36:24,685
Really?

484
00:36:25,685 --> 00:36:27,685
You only said it after I said it.

485
00:36:28,365 --> 00:36:31,005
They say pregnant women are unreasonable.

486
00:36:31,525 --> 00:36:32,845
It seems the saying is true.

487
00:36:35,445 --> 00:36:36,285
Right.

488
00:36:43,045 --> 00:36:46,405
This is a belated birthday gift.

489
00:36:50,285 --> 00:36:52,245
ULTRASOUND PREGNANCY SCAN REPORT

490
00:36:54,325 --> 00:36:55,165
Mumu.

491
00:36:59,005 --> 00:37:00,285
This is the best gift...

492
00:37:01,365 --> 00:37:02,525
I've ever received.

493
00:37:16,205 --> 00:37:17,085
Stop crying.

494
00:37:20,365 --> 00:37:21,365
I'm back.

495
00:37:44,485 --> 00:37:45,925
-You?
-It's you?

496
00:37:48,005 --> 00:37:48,925
Mrs. Ling.

497
00:37:49,005 --> 00:37:51,765
Director Ling's physical functions
have mostly returned to normal.

498
00:37:52,165 --> 00:37:54,325
But his blood circulation is not good
after being in bed.

499
00:37:54,925 --> 00:37:56,565
His physical strength is still an issue.

500
00:37:57,285 --> 00:37:59,845
He should take walks
in the park more often.

501
00:38:01,005 --> 00:38:02,685
I got it. Thank you, doctor.

502
00:38:03,565 --> 00:38:06,965
Congratulations, Mrs. Ling.
You made the miracle happen.

503
00:38:07,805 --> 00:38:09,685
Not me. We did.

504
00:38:11,925 --> 00:38:13,525
Why did you come to the hospital?

505
00:38:13,605 --> 00:38:14,765
I have to thank you.

506
00:38:15,925 --> 00:38:17,685
-Thank me?
-Yes.

507
00:38:17,885 --> 00:38:21,045
Without your money, my mom wouldn't
be able to stay in such a nice hospital.

508
00:38:22,965 --> 00:38:23,885
Your mom's sick?

509
00:38:24,965 --> 00:38:25,805
Yes.

510
00:38:27,005 --> 00:38:28,085
Intestine cancer.

511
00:38:29,045 --> 00:38:30,685
Sorry. I didn't know that.

512
00:38:31,645 --> 00:38:33,645
It's OK. I'm used to it.

513
00:38:34,325 --> 00:38:36,045
My mom has had several surgeries.

514
00:38:36,485 --> 00:38:41,045
This time, her cancer metastasized.
The doctor said it can't be operated on.

515
00:38:41,925 --> 00:38:45,245
I just want to make my mom's
last days more comfortable.

516
00:38:45,805 --> 00:38:48,805
I heard this is
the best hospital in Gangdong.

517
00:38:49,205 --> 00:38:50,645
So I helped my mom transfer here.

518
00:38:53,805 --> 00:38:55,165
Don't be so depressed.

519
00:38:56,245 --> 00:38:57,205
My mom always says,

520
00:38:57,285 --> 00:38:59,565
"To each their own destiny."

521
00:39:00,165 --> 00:39:02,565
We have to be happy every day we're alive.

522
00:39:05,005 --> 00:39:07,405
I see you have your mother's
optimistic personality.

523
00:39:07,805 --> 00:39:08,645
Yes.

524
00:39:09,445 --> 00:39:10,285
By the way,

525
00:39:10,605 --> 00:39:13,965
those men who came to collect debt.
Did they bother you again?

526
00:39:16,165 --> 00:39:20,045
I lied to you about those men.

527
00:39:21,245 --> 00:39:22,325
I knew it.

528
00:39:23,245 --> 00:39:26,085
They weren't there to collect debt.
They were sent by my father.

529
00:39:26,725 --> 00:39:29,525
Your dad?
Why did he send someone after you?

530
00:39:31,365 --> 00:39:34,085
It's a dramatic story.

531
00:39:35,005 --> 00:39:38,405
My dad moved to the city
and abandoned his pregnant wife.

532
00:39:38,965 --> 00:39:40,565
He married a woman from a rich family.

533
00:39:40,645 --> 00:39:42,605
They realized they couldn't conceive.

534
00:39:43,245 --> 00:39:45,005
So, he tried to get his child back.

535
00:39:45,525 --> 00:39:47,925
Unfortunately...

536
00:39:49,365 --> 00:39:50,205
I am that child.

537
00:39:53,525 --> 00:39:55,125
Stop laughing at my misery.

538
00:39:56,725 --> 00:39:59,765
No... Actually, I want to tell you

539
00:40:00,205 --> 00:40:01,685
my family's story is just as dramatic.

540
00:40:03,845 --> 00:40:04,885
OK.

541
00:40:05,445 --> 00:40:08,125
Let's celebrate our luck, then.

542
00:40:09,245 --> 00:40:10,085
OK.

543
00:40:11,365 --> 00:40:12,685
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

544
00:40:20,085 --> 00:40:22,365
GANGDONG MEDICAL CENTER
GANGDONG MINGZHOU HOSPITAL

545
00:40:37,885 --> 00:40:39,285
Here. Take this.

546
00:40:39,365 --> 00:40:41,525
Who's the patient?
Who's taking care of who now?

547
00:40:42,245 --> 00:40:43,725
He's happy to do this, right?

548
00:40:46,645 --> 00:40:47,845
The doctor said

549
00:40:48,445 --> 00:40:51,485
his blood circulation isn't good.
He needs to walk more.

550
00:40:52,085 --> 00:40:54,485
Fine. You're the pregnant lady.
We defer to you.

551
00:40:54,685 --> 00:40:56,045
You call the shots.

552
00:40:56,645 --> 00:40:58,805
Wen Li, how's the company doing?

553
00:40:59,405 --> 00:41:01,245
Everything's good. However...

554
00:41:01,325 --> 00:41:03,045
You don't have to worry with Wen Li here.

555
00:41:03,125 --> 00:41:04,525
He can take care of everything.

556
00:41:08,205 --> 00:41:09,805
When did you become such a fan of Wen Li?

557
00:41:11,365 --> 00:41:12,525
Not really.

558
00:41:12,605 --> 00:41:15,525
He just manages the company.
Nothing to admire.

559
00:41:16,085 --> 00:41:19,045
Unlike you. The apple you peel is sweeter.

560
00:41:20,765 --> 00:41:21,805
You guys carry on.

561
00:41:22,125 --> 00:41:23,205
I'll go enjoy my date, too.

562
00:41:24,605 --> 00:41:25,445
Let's go.

563
00:41:26,205 --> 00:41:27,245
Let's go.

564
00:41:28,085 --> 00:41:29,125
Did you see that?

565
00:41:29,325 --> 00:41:31,605
Wen Li is now under Feifei's control.

566
00:41:33,085 --> 00:41:34,285
Did I miss something?

567
00:41:34,365 --> 00:41:36,125
No. Nothing.

568
00:41:36,645 --> 00:41:39,365
You just need to focus on getting better.

569
00:41:41,285 --> 00:41:43,485
Where's Chu Yan? He went out earlier.

570
00:41:44,405 --> 00:41:45,325
I'll go check on him.

571
00:41:46,685 --> 00:41:47,525
Eat this.

572
00:41:48,725 --> 00:41:49,645
Take care of him.

573
00:42:03,125 --> 00:42:04,885
Thank you for coming to see my mom

574
00:42:05,205 --> 00:42:06,885
and transferring her to the VIP room.

575
00:42:08,045 --> 00:42:08,885
It's nothing.

576
00:42:09,205 --> 00:42:11,405
I want to return your favor
of buying me drinks yesterday.

577
00:42:12,365 --> 00:42:13,485
Chu Yan?

578
00:42:14,925 --> 00:42:17,005
If everything's OK, I'll...

579
00:42:18,965 --> 00:42:19,805
Xia Lin?

580
00:42:27,005 --> 00:42:28,925
Boys can't wear green.

581
00:42:29,405 --> 00:42:30,525
Why don't you go in?

582
00:42:30,605 --> 00:42:32,685
No... Don't cry... I take it back.

583
00:42:32,765 --> 00:42:35,805
It looks good on you. Really cute.

584
00:42:37,085 --> 00:42:39,605
What are you doing, honey?

585
00:42:39,965 --> 00:42:40,925
You look so happy.

586
00:42:44,205 --> 00:42:46,125
Who gave you this? It's so ugly.

587
00:42:46,445 --> 00:42:47,965
And it's green. Why?

588
00:42:49,165 --> 00:42:50,805
Don't accept this kind of gift anymore.

589
00:42:52,285 --> 00:42:53,725
OK, honey.

590
00:42:58,845 --> 00:43:00,725
-Take it.
-So cute.

591
00:44:30,925 --> 00:44:32,685
Subtitle translation by Christina Liu

592
00:44:32,765 --> 00:44:33,805
Go away.

593
00:44:34,005 --> 00:44:35,725
So she's the girl you like.

594
00:44:36,565 --> 00:44:37,405
How do you--

595
00:44:37,485 --> 00:44:40,805
The way you look at her is different
from the way you look at others.

596
00:44:41,325 --> 00:44:43,885
Nan Jintian made me realize
how horrible hate is.

597
00:44:44,765 --> 00:44:46,165
So I've decided not to hate you.

598
00:44:46,725 --> 00:44:49,965
I want to thank you for giving me
the chance to have happiness in life.

599
00:44:51,045 --> 00:44:53,445
I've found the person
I can give up everything for.

600
00:44:54,285 --> 00:44:55,845
The person I want to spend my life with.
