1
00:00:12,885 --> 00:00:15,725
Even if there was only a 0.01% chance
of seeing you fall from grace,

2
00:00:15,805 --> 00:00:17,405
I'd still do everything I could.

3
00:00:17,645 --> 00:00:20,485
The only person who fell from grace
and lost everything...

4
00:00:20,925 --> 00:00:21,805
is you.

5
00:00:21,885 --> 00:00:23,525
An Ran, according to our investigation,

6
00:00:23,605 --> 00:00:25,685
you're accused of arson and kidnapping.

7
00:00:25,765 --> 00:00:27,485
You're now under arrest.

8
00:00:27,565 --> 00:00:29,725
Regardless of whether it was
An Ran or Yang Tong,

9
00:00:30,125 --> 00:00:32,525
they were just pawns being sacrificed.

10
00:00:32,765 --> 00:00:34,565
This matter isn't over yet.

11
00:00:35,925 --> 00:00:37,605
Who are you? Why are you following me?

12
00:00:38,645 --> 00:00:40,885
I'm sorry,
I thought you were someone else.

13
00:00:42,685 --> 00:00:46,445
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

14
00:02:13,325 --> 00:02:16,285
EPISODE 15

15
00:02:37,685 --> 00:02:41,765
Feifei, do you know
any private detectives?

16
00:02:42,365 --> 00:02:43,485
I want to find someone.

17
00:02:44,165 --> 00:02:47,045
Yes. Please look into this for me.
Love you.

18
00:02:49,005 --> 00:02:50,645
Other than me, who else do you love?

19
00:02:52,765 --> 00:02:54,005
You heard what I was saying?

20
00:02:54,285 --> 00:02:56,445
I heard everything.
Who do you want to find?

21
00:02:57,165 --> 00:02:59,125
Didn't you say
you wouldn't interfere with my life?

22
00:02:59,205 --> 00:03:00,685
Of course I'm not interfering.

23
00:03:01,365 --> 00:03:04,005
I could introduce
some private detectives to you.

24
00:03:05,765 --> 00:03:06,805
Are you serious?

25
00:03:07,285 --> 00:03:08,285
Of course I'm serious.

26
00:03:09,325 --> 00:03:11,605
I mean, how would Jia Fei
know any private detectives?

27
00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:14,325
Then give me their numbers.

28
00:03:21,845 --> 00:03:22,925
What were you thinking?

29
00:03:23,325 --> 00:03:25,725
I just wanted you to feed me a cherry.

30
00:03:32,005 --> 00:03:33,245
Then get it yourself.

31
00:03:47,565 --> 00:03:50,245
Tastes good. You know, with cherries,

32
00:03:50,645 --> 00:03:53,445
the more, the better.

33
00:03:53,765 --> 00:03:56,565
Ling Yizhou, you rascal!
I'm going to call the cops on you.

34
00:03:57,885 --> 00:03:59,285
You don't want my help?

35
00:04:01,725 --> 00:04:02,565
Tell me what to do.

36
00:04:05,005 --> 00:04:07,285
First, get your phone.

37
00:04:08,765 --> 00:04:11,085
Second, call Wen Li.

38
00:04:12,245 --> 00:04:16,765
Three, tell Wen Li what you want to do.

39
00:04:17,525 --> 00:04:18,965
Wen Li can command the Lingshi Group,

40
00:04:19,365 --> 00:04:21,005
and you can command Wen Li.

41
00:04:27,485 --> 00:04:29,645
Ling Yizhou, you're so good to me.

42
00:04:30,605 --> 00:04:34,605
That being the case, can the beautiful
Miss Xia come to bed now?

43
00:04:35,365 --> 00:04:37,405
Why are you always talking
about sleeping now?

44
00:04:37,845 --> 00:04:41,645
I'm a lucky man. The person
I want to sleep with is my wife.

45
00:04:42,045 --> 00:04:43,085
You're such a...

46
00:04:44,325 --> 00:04:45,165
Mr. Ling,

47
00:04:45,605 --> 00:04:47,645
you asked me to look
into Yang Tong's whereabouts,

48
00:04:48,125 --> 00:04:49,845
but I haven't found any major clues yet.

49
00:04:50,245 --> 00:04:52,645
What I can confirm is
that she's currently still in Gangdong.

50
00:04:53,765 --> 00:04:56,645
We haven't found the person
she's working for either.

51
00:04:57,165 --> 00:04:58,765
I'm sure that person's target is me.

52
00:04:59,965 --> 00:05:01,525
Expand the scope of this investigation.

53
00:05:01,925 --> 00:05:03,685
Investigate every single person

54
00:05:03,765 --> 00:05:06,525
who has criticized
either Lingshi Group or me.

55
00:05:07,045 --> 00:05:07,885
Yes, sir.

56
00:05:12,085 --> 00:05:13,365
Mr. Ling, it's your wife.

57
00:05:14,805 --> 00:05:15,645
Take the call.

58
00:05:18,085 --> 00:05:19,085
Hello, Mrs. Ling.

59
00:05:19,165 --> 00:05:22,045
<i>Mr. Wen, I want to ask you for a favor.</i>

60
00:05:22,725 --> 00:05:23,645
Of course.

61
00:05:24,245 --> 00:05:25,885
I want you to find someone for me.

62
00:05:26,085 --> 00:05:27,605
She's in Gangdong right now.

63
00:05:28,325 --> 00:05:29,365
What's her name?

64
00:05:30,485 --> 00:05:31,925
I don't know her name,

65
00:05:32,765 --> 00:05:36,045
but the person I'm looking for
is Ling Yizhou's mom.

66
00:05:38,085 --> 00:05:40,125
<i>You absolutely cannot tell Yizhou</i>
<i>about this.</i>

67
00:05:40,845 --> 00:05:41,725
Got it.

68
00:05:42,245 --> 00:05:43,645
Contact me once you find anything.

69
00:05:44,565 --> 00:05:45,405
<i>Yes, ma'am.</i>

70
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:55,645
-Mr. Ling, your wife--
-You don't need to tell me.

71
00:05:56,365 --> 00:05:58,885
She'll tell me if she wants me to know.

72
00:06:03,845 --> 00:06:05,285
You had time to stop over today?

73
00:06:08,005 --> 00:06:09,245
I wanted to give this to you.

74
00:06:11,205 --> 00:06:13,045
<i>You and Your Charm</i>.

75
00:06:15,045 --> 00:06:16,085
Linlin,

76
00:06:16,165 --> 00:06:18,525
someone's finally going to invest
in my movie script.

77
00:06:19,125 --> 00:06:22,165
All the time I've spent looking
for investors hasn't been in vain.

78
00:06:24,765 --> 00:06:26,165
Who's the talent scout?

79
00:06:28,525 --> 00:06:30,765
Mr. Ling, of course.

80
00:06:35,445 --> 00:06:39,725
Calm down. We did everything according
to the rules. We did nothing illegitimate.

81
00:06:40,925 --> 00:06:42,645
So, who will be playing...

82
00:06:45,565 --> 00:06:48,445
Miss Xia, I cordially invite you

83
00:06:48,525 --> 00:06:52,285
to play the first love
of the lead actor in this movie.

84
00:06:53,605 --> 00:06:54,805
Who's the lead actor?

85
00:06:55,405 --> 00:06:56,525
The lovely Mr. Chu.

86
00:06:57,205 --> 00:06:59,765
He didn't want to take it at first,

87
00:07:00,045 --> 00:07:04,605
but after reading my script,
he liked it so much he agreed to it.

88
00:07:10,725 --> 00:07:14,045
A story about a secret crush?

89
00:07:14,125 --> 00:07:16,925
That's right. The story's inspiration
comes from real-life experiences.

90
00:07:17,565 --> 00:07:20,445
I once was secretly in love
with a handsome young man,

91
00:07:20,525 --> 00:07:22,285
and when he was at a train station...

92
00:07:22,965 --> 00:07:24,085
Let me tell you a story.

93
00:07:24,925 --> 00:07:25,845
Sure.

94
00:07:27,325 --> 00:07:28,285
I have a secret crush.

95
00:07:29,285 --> 00:07:32,725
He had a fall out with his father
all because of you.

96
00:07:33,325 --> 00:07:36,325
What could that mean
other than that he loved you?

97
00:07:38,645 --> 00:07:40,725
Linlin. Hey, Linlin.

98
00:07:41,285 --> 00:07:42,405
What's on your mind?

99
00:07:42,485 --> 00:07:43,725
I was just talking to you.

100
00:07:45,925 --> 00:07:49,565
I don't think
I'll be able to play that role.

101
00:07:52,565 --> 00:07:54,685
You know that Chu Yan likes you.

102
00:07:54,765 --> 00:07:55,805
You...

103
00:07:56,885 --> 00:08:00,085
I only noticed it
at the brand launch event.

104
00:08:00,565 --> 00:08:03,845
But I know you treat him as a friend,
so I didn't say anything.

105
00:08:05,285 --> 00:08:06,645
How did you find out?

106
00:08:06,925 --> 00:08:07,765
Did he tell you?

107
00:08:08,365 --> 00:08:10,365
Stop being ridiculous. An Ran told me.

108
00:08:12,365 --> 00:08:13,765
She always has evil intentions.

109
00:08:14,485 --> 00:08:17,485
I think it would be best
if you ask him about it directly.

110
00:08:17,565 --> 00:08:19,725
We're all just speculating here.

111
00:08:19,805 --> 00:08:21,925
If he really likes you...

112
00:08:23,165 --> 00:08:24,405
then he's an unfortunate soul.

113
00:08:24,485 --> 00:08:27,125
He fell for his best friend's wife.

114
00:08:28,845 --> 00:08:31,285
-Just thinking about it makes me sad.
-Feifei!

115
00:08:31,885 --> 00:08:33,685
Alright, I'll stop talking about it.

116
00:08:33,965 --> 00:08:35,485
But if he admits it,

117
00:08:35,565 --> 00:08:37,485
you need to end it immediately.
You got me?

118
00:08:38,005 --> 00:08:39,405
Don't let him think he has a chance.

119
00:08:39,804 --> 00:08:42,725
If you don't, you all might create
a drama-filled love triangle.

120
00:08:43,405 --> 00:08:45,285
What are you going to do with this script?

121
00:08:46,405 --> 00:08:49,805
Why worry about finding actors
when I have a screenplay masterpiece?

122
00:08:50,805 --> 00:08:54,605
I just thought it suited you two well,
so I took advantage of our friendship.

123
00:08:56,285 --> 00:08:59,445
I'll look for someone else
if you think it would be awkward.

124
00:09:01,685 --> 00:09:02,525
What time is it?

125
00:09:06,445 --> 00:09:08,725
I have a meeting in a bit.
I've got to go now.

126
00:09:10,405 --> 00:09:11,965
Remember to get a clear answer from him.

127
00:09:12,405 --> 00:09:13,445
I understand.

128
00:09:15,245 --> 00:09:16,325
Oh, yeah...

129
00:09:16,405 --> 00:09:18,405
I couldn't find
a private detective for you.

130
00:09:19,245 --> 00:09:20,885
I've already taken care of it. Get going.

131
00:09:21,965 --> 00:09:23,285
Bye. See you.

132
00:09:23,685 --> 00:09:24,525
Bye.

133
00:10:00,085 --> 00:10:01,125
You're so immature.

134
00:10:01,485 --> 00:10:02,645
Then why did you get tricked?

135
00:10:02,925 --> 00:10:05,085
-You're silly.
-You're the silly one.

136
00:10:13,445 --> 00:10:15,125
So what did you want to talk about?

137
00:10:15,645 --> 00:10:19,845
I heard you agreed
to be in Jia Fei's movie.

138
00:10:20,445 --> 00:10:23,125
It's because I'm afraid of her.
She called me 30 times a day.

139
00:10:25,285 --> 00:10:28,685
She asked me to be
the lead actor's first love.

140
00:10:29,605 --> 00:10:31,605
Oh... really?

141
00:10:32,565 --> 00:10:36,285
During the time you disappeared,

142
00:10:37,445 --> 00:10:42,005
An Ran told me... She said that...

143
00:10:45,445 --> 00:10:47,325
Just say it. Stop beating around the bush.

144
00:10:47,645 --> 00:10:48,845
If you can't say it, drop it.

145
00:10:56,565 --> 00:10:58,365
An Ran said that...

146
00:10:59,365 --> 00:11:01,045
you like me.

147
00:11:02,245 --> 00:11:03,565
I know you're a good person,

148
00:11:04,245 --> 00:11:06,845
but I love Ling Yizhou, so...

149
00:11:11,125 --> 00:11:12,965
What did you just say? I like you?

150
00:11:14,005 --> 00:11:16,725
That's the funniest thing
I've ever heard in my whole life.

151
00:11:16,805 --> 00:11:19,365
What do you mean? That liking me is funny?

152
00:11:19,445 --> 00:11:21,165
So, I'm not a likable person?

153
00:11:22,365 --> 00:11:24,285
When it comes to women I like,

154
00:11:24,365 --> 00:11:26,245
they at least have to be
a Best Actress winner.

155
00:11:27,005 --> 00:11:30,365
So you can get in line after you win that.

156
00:11:30,685 --> 00:11:31,965
Then I might consider it.

157
00:11:34,165 --> 00:11:37,885
You once said you have a crush on someone.

158
00:11:38,525 --> 00:11:40,925
Miss, get over yourself.

159
00:11:41,405 --> 00:11:42,445
Let me tell you something.

160
00:11:43,045 --> 00:11:45,765
Even if you were
the last woman in the world...

161
00:11:46,805 --> 00:11:48,525
I'd rather be with Ling.

162
00:11:48,605 --> 00:11:50,525
Screw you. Ling Yizhou is mine.

163
00:11:50,765 --> 00:11:52,805
Try being a woman
in your next life if you want him.

164
00:11:54,165 --> 00:11:56,765
An Ran lied to me again. I knew it.

165
00:11:57,445 --> 00:11:59,405
Don't blame others
because your brain is faulty.

166
00:12:00,925 --> 00:12:03,365
That being the case,
I can be in Jia Fei's movie now.

167
00:12:03,845 --> 00:12:05,445
You're still thinking of turning it down?

168
00:12:05,525 --> 00:12:07,205
I didn't want it to be awkward.

169
00:12:08,205 --> 00:12:09,165
Enough of that.

170
00:12:09,245 --> 00:12:12,045
Only Jia Fei would ask Xia Lin
to act in a movie sincerely.

171
00:12:12,445 --> 00:12:14,565
Everyone else just wants
to get on Mr. Ling's good side.

172
00:12:14,645 --> 00:12:17,165
You were going to reject it?
Who do you think you are?

173
00:12:17,245 --> 00:12:18,445
It's none of your business.

174
00:12:20,605 --> 00:12:23,125
-Ouch!
-Stop playing around and get up.

175
00:12:24,365 --> 00:12:26,965
It really hurts.
I think I'll need money for medicine.

176
00:12:27,045 --> 00:12:29,245
Yizhou can take you to the doctor then,
because I won't.

177
00:12:32,165 --> 00:12:33,805
Oh, wow. I'm OK now.

178
00:12:34,205 --> 00:12:35,045
I'm fine.

179
00:12:36,525 --> 00:12:37,445
By the way...

180
00:12:39,565 --> 00:12:43,205
how are things with your dad now?

181
00:12:46,005 --> 00:12:47,565
That old geezer?

182
00:12:51,685 --> 00:12:53,805
I'd say health-wise, he's doing OK.

183
00:12:54,525 --> 00:12:57,885
When he found out
about what happened to you,

184
00:12:58,205 --> 00:12:59,725
all of a sudden he aged so fast.

185
00:13:00,605 --> 00:13:02,165
I think he really loves you.

186
00:13:02,765 --> 00:13:04,445
He just doesn't know how to express it.

187
00:13:05,365 --> 00:13:07,565
You should try to talk to him about it.

188
00:13:08,285 --> 00:13:10,925
Maybe you can break
the barrier between you two.

189
00:13:11,325 --> 00:13:15,045
Alright. You have enough
to worry about already.

190
00:13:15,445 --> 00:13:16,445
I'll handle it myself.

191
00:13:18,125 --> 00:13:19,165
So, what about your crush?

192
00:13:19,485 --> 00:13:20,325
I think I'll give up.

193
00:13:20,405 --> 00:13:21,285
Why?

194
00:13:24,645 --> 00:13:26,205
Seeing her happy is good enough for me.

195
00:13:26,605 --> 00:13:29,165
It doesn't matter how I feel.

196
00:13:30,365 --> 00:13:32,805
I never would have guessed
you were a lovesick romantic.

197
00:13:33,045 --> 00:13:36,805
Don't worry.
We'll find you one just as good.

198
00:13:37,565 --> 00:13:40,685
Don't introduce a bunch of hot messes,
or I'll stop being friends.

199
00:13:46,765 --> 00:13:49,805
<i>Mrs. Ling, I found her.</i>
<i>She's staying at Lingyun Hotel.</i>

200
00:13:49,885 --> 00:13:50,725
What's up?

201
00:13:52,005 --> 00:13:53,725
Something came up. I have to go.

202
00:13:53,805 --> 00:13:55,005
Do you need a ride?

203
00:13:55,085 --> 00:13:56,405
That's OK. I've got to go now.

204
00:13:56,485 --> 00:13:58,245
Talk soon. Bye.

205
00:13:58,325 --> 00:13:59,165
Bye.

206
00:14:12,005 --> 00:14:14,645
<i>Chu Yan, you did well</i>.

207
00:14:34,445 --> 00:14:35,485
Mrs. Ling.

208
00:14:54,005 --> 00:14:55,245
-Hey.
-Hi.

209
00:14:55,325 --> 00:14:56,965
It's you. The movie star
who owes me money.

210
00:14:58,125 --> 00:14:59,685
Get in. I'll drive to a bank.

211
00:15:00,325 --> 00:15:01,765
Don't worry about the money now.

212
00:15:01,845 --> 00:15:03,805
Could you do me a favor, though?

213
00:15:04,045 --> 00:15:05,205
My scooter is broken,

214
00:15:05,445 --> 00:15:07,245
and I haven't made all my deliveries yet.

215
00:15:07,605 --> 00:15:12,125
I'll be in trouble
if a customer complains.

216
00:15:12,645 --> 00:15:14,645
No. How could I let you
bring food in my car?

217
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:21,525
Do you want your video posted online then?

218
00:15:22,685 --> 00:15:23,605
You're threatening me?

219
00:15:23,845 --> 00:15:25,485
I wouldn't say that.

220
00:15:25,565 --> 00:15:27,645
We're just two people
helping one another out.

221
00:15:28,845 --> 00:15:29,805
Sorry to trouble you.

222
00:15:30,445 --> 00:15:31,565
There's a fan over there.

223
00:15:33,645 --> 00:15:34,885
Hurry up! Go.

224
00:15:41,005 --> 00:15:41,845
Let's go.

225
00:15:42,605 --> 00:15:44,045
Hey! Did you lie to me?

226
00:15:46,085 --> 00:15:49,805
I promise I'll erase the video
once my deliveries are finished.

227
00:15:50,565 --> 00:15:51,605
You'd better.

228
00:15:53,365 --> 00:15:54,205
Your seatbelt.

229
00:15:59,085 --> 00:16:00,445
I presume you asked me here today

230
00:16:00,965 --> 00:16:02,765
because you know who I am already.

231
00:16:03,685 --> 00:16:04,805
What about Yizhou?

232
00:16:05,445 --> 00:16:06,765
He doesn't know I came to see you.

233
00:16:07,125 --> 00:16:09,445
I saw you in an old photo.

234
00:16:10,845 --> 00:16:12,285
I didn't think he'd hold onto it.

235
00:16:14,565 --> 00:16:16,045
If you don't mind me asking,

236
00:16:16,965 --> 00:16:20,565
why did you abandon Ling Yizhou?

237
00:16:21,125 --> 00:16:23,365
He's never told you?

238
00:16:24,405 --> 00:16:26,525
He's never mentioned you.

239
00:16:28,405 --> 00:16:29,245
Really?

240
00:16:30,765 --> 00:16:31,965
He probably hates me.

241
00:16:33,485 --> 00:16:34,325
Mrs. Ling...

242
00:16:35,605 --> 00:16:39,925
nobody would hate their own mother
for no reason.

243
00:16:40,525 --> 00:16:43,005
True. You're right.

244
00:16:44,245 --> 00:16:46,605
I was sick of his father's tyranny.

245
00:16:47,365 --> 00:16:48,405
So I...

246
00:16:49,805 --> 00:16:51,005
fell in love with someone else.

247
00:16:53,765 --> 00:16:55,365
I know that, to you,

248
00:16:56,045 --> 00:16:57,765
that's not what a good wife would do.

249
00:16:59,405 --> 00:17:02,125
But back when I got married to his dad...

250
00:17:04,605 --> 00:17:05,765
we enjoyed happy times.

251
00:17:07,005 --> 00:17:08,525
Unfortunately, good times never last.

252
00:17:08,925 --> 00:17:12,364
Over time,
his controlling nature revealed itself.

253
00:17:12,445 --> 00:17:13,485
Where are you going?

254
00:17:13,565 --> 00:17:16,324
Jin Yun asked me to go shopping with her,
so I won't be back for lunch.

255
00:17:16,725 --> 00:17:17,645
Jin Yun?

256
00:17:18,205 --> 00:17:21,045
She's the neighbor who just moved in.

257
00:17:21,685 --> 00:17:24,005
She came over to say hello recently.
You two have met.

258
00:17:24,245 --> 00:17:25,725
Why didn't you tell me last night?

259
00:17:26,245 --> 00:17:27,285
You came home late.

260
00:17:28,245 --> 00:17:30,324
And it's not even a big deal.

261
00:17:31,805 --> 00:17:33,005
Get home before three o'clock.

262
00:17:33,525 --> 00:17:35,285
You need to go to a banquet
with me tonight.

263
00:17:35,685 --> 00:17:38,405
Next time you want to go out,
you need to tell me earlier.

264
00:17:48,605 --> 00:17:50,885
Your skirt's too short.
Put on something else first.

265
00:17:53,925 --> 00:17:55,365
It got more unreasonable over time.

266
00:17:55,725 --> 00:17:57,885
He treated home life
like he was running a company.

267
00:17:59,765 --> 00:18:03,845
Whatever I did...
I needed his permission first.

268
00:18:04,925 --> 00:18:07,845
I wasn't allowed to work
and I couldn't have friends.

269
00:18:08,165 --> 00:18:11,565
Even food. If he didn't like it...

270
00:18:13,365 --> 00:18:14,845
then I couldn't eat it.

271
00:18:15,285 --> 00:18:18,525
<i>I guess bullying runs in the family</i>.

272
00:18:18,925 --> 00:18:23,605
Did you ever stand up to Yizhou's father?

273
00:18:27,765 --> 00:18:28,845
For Yizhou's sake...

274
00:18:31,125 --> 00:18:33,165
I settled for peace time after time.

275
00:18:33,885 --> 00:18:35,005
But all I got from that...

276
00:18:36,805 --> 00:18:38,805
was a growing sense of feeling suffocated.

277
00:18:40,885 --> 00:18:41,725
What are you doing?

278
00:18:42,645 --> 00:18:44,845
Ling Jing, I'm not one of your employees.

279
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:46,645
I deserve to have my own freedom.

280
00:18:47,245 --> 00:18:48,485
You can't keep me locked up.

281
00:18:48,565 --> 00:18:49,885
I don't stop you from going out.

282
00:18:50,285 --> 00:18:51,245
You don't?

283
00:18:52,605 --> 00:18:56,405
I always have two bodyguards with me.
Am I a convict?

284
00:18:57,765 --> 00:19:02,885
Ling Jing, you are a selfish dictator,
through and through.

285
00:19:04,805 --> 00:19:05,765
I want a divorce.

286
00:19:06,005 --> 00:19:07,125
Are you crazy?

287
00:19:07,485 --> 00:19:09,005
Mom, where are you going?

288
00:19:09,085 --> 00:19:11,485
Go back to bed right now.
She can go wherever she likes.

289
00:19:17,205 --> 00:19:18,205
At that moment...

290
00:19:19,685 --> 00:19:23,125
I knew that was the only chance
I'd ever have to escape from that home.

291
00:19:23,445 --> 00:19:24,285
Mom!

292
00:19:24,365 --> 00:19:25,445
So I...

293
00:19:25,885 --> 00:19:27,645
So you abandoned Yizhou.

294
00:19:27,725 --> 00:19:28,925
I had no choice.

295
00:19:29,805 --> 00:19:31,005
If I'd taken Yizhou with me,

296
00:19:31,485 --> 00:19:32,805
Ling Jing would have stopped me.

297
00:19:32,885 --> 00:19:34,605
Have you ever thought about that fact that

298
00:19:35,325 --> 00:19:37,045
he was still so young when you left?

299
00:19:37,605 --> 00:19:40,125
How would he be able to deal
with a controlling father like that?

300
00:19:40,885 --> 00:19:43,205
I didn't think about anything
at that time.

301
00:19:45,805 --> 00:19:46,765
So, later on...

302
00:19:47,805 --> 00:19:49,605
did you go back to see him often?

303
00:19:51,885 --> 00:19:52,925
I wasn't brave enough...

304
00:19:55,925 --> 00:19:57,805
to see the resentment in his eyes.

305
00:19:59,805 --> 00:20:03,085
His father died 18 months ago.

306
00:20:03,725 --> 00:20:06,725
I worried he couldn't deal with it alone,
so I hurried back.

307
00:20:08,485 --> 00:20:10,325
But the whole time,
he never wanted to see me.

308
00:20:11,685 --> 00:20:12,925
I know you feel that...

309
00:20:14,525 --> 00:20:16,045
I was a failure as a mother.

310
00:20:17,165 --> 00:20:19,685
I didn't fulfill
the responsibilities of a mother.

311
00:20:21,445 --> 00:20:23,525
To be honest,
I'd never expect Yizhou to forgive me.

312
00:20:24,845 --> 00:20:27,725
I just hope that I'll be able
to watch him from afar.

313
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:32,125
I just want to see him happy.

314
00:20:34,245 --> 00:20:35,325
Then I can feel at ease.

315
00:20:49,685 --> 00:20:50,725
You're not going to eat?

316
00:20:51,445 --> 00:20:52,485
Give me the ribs then.

317
00:21:00,605 --> 00:21:01,725
You seem quite content.

318
00:21:02,565 --> 00:21:04,125
I have food to eat, clothes to wear,

319
00:21:04,645 --> 00:21:06,245
and a job to support myself.

320
00:21:06,485 --> 00:21:07,485
Why would I be discontent?

321
00:21:08,445 --> 00:21:09,645
The people I hate the most

322
00:21:10,005 --> 00:21:12,725
are people who feel sorry for themselves
and whine all the time.

323
00:21:14,605 --> 00:21:17,565
I just hate seeing you whine all the time.

324
00:21:17,645 --> 00:21:19,525
It's not like the entire world owes you.

325
00:21:27,685 --> 00:21:28,525
Why are you laughing?

326
00:21:29,005 --> 00:21:33,125
I'm laughing because somebody
once told me what you just said.

327
00:21:34,365 --> 00:21:35,765
You have a nice smile.

328
00:21:36,725 --> 00:21:37,805
You should laugh more.

329
00:21:41,045 --> 00:21:41,885
Thank you.

330
00:21:42,925 --> 00:21:45,405
Are you sick or something?
Why are you thanking me?

331
00:21:46,685 --> 00:21:48,685
Thank you for occupying my time
so I don't feel sad.

332
00:21:53,845 --> 00:21:56,205
Young lady,
don't you fall in love with me.

333
00:21:56,645 --> 00:21:57,725
What are you talking about?

334
00:21:59,565 --> 00:22:01,405
I already like someone else.

335
00:22:03,965 --> 00:22:05,085
As if I care.

336
00:22:07,325 --> 00:22:08,405
Hurry up and eat.

337
00:22:21,845 --> 00:22:23,965
LINGSHI GROUP

338
00:22:25,725 --> 00:22:28,205
I told you to stop.
Why aren't you listening to me?

339
00:22:28,285 --> 00:22:29,405
What are you arguing about?

340
00:22:29,925 --> 00:22:30,765
Director Ling.

341
00:22:32,085 --> 00:22:33,005
Mumu, why are you here?

342
00:22:33,445 --> 00:22:35,805
I came to check up on you.
So, I'm not welcome here?

343
00:22:36,205 --> 00:22:37,485
Feeling guilty about something?

344
00:22:37,565 --> 00:22:39,125
How could I? I've done nothing wrong.

345
00:22:40,525 --> 00:22:41,565
I was just kidding.

346
00:22:42,005 --> 00:22:43,445
I brought you some food.

347
00:22:43,525 --> 00:22:45,885
I was worried you'd be so busy
you'd forget to eat.

348
00:22:46,445 --> 00:22:47,765
What a considerate wife.

349
00:22:48,765 --> 00:22:51,125
Director Ling, I'm going to leave now.

350
00:23:00,365 --> 00:23:03,245
Who's that female secretary out there?

351
00:23:03,605 --> 00:23:06,485
I don't know her. She transferred
up to us after Wen Li's injury.

352
00:23:07,765 --> 00:23:08,765
She won't last.

353
00:23:09,445 --> 00:23:12,205
What do I have to be worried about?
She's not as pretty as me.

354
00:23:14,125 --> 00:23:15,045
What did you do today?

355
00:23:16,525 --> 00:23:17,845
I met up with Chu Yan.

356
00:23:17,925 --> 00:23:20,485
He's getting old.
I want to find him a girlfriend.

357
00:23:20,765 --> 00:23:21,925
He told me not to interfere.

358
00:23:22,325 --> 00:23:24,685
Chu Yan is well aware
about marriage and stuff.

359
00:23:24,765 --> 00:23:25,685
It's not your concern.

360
00:23:26,725 --> 00:23:28,445
Alright, finish eating
and get back to work.

361
00:23:29,845 --> 00:23:30,725
I don't want to work.

362
00:23:31,085 --> 00:23:33,525
I'm done with work for the day.
The rest of the day is yours.

363
00:23:33,805 --> 00:23:35,485
It's getting late. How about we head home?

364
00:23:35,565 --> 00:23:36,405
No...

365
00:23:37,005 --> 00:23:39,045
I'm so tired. Hug me for a while.

366
00:23:42,045 --> 00:23:44,765
Director Ling, the documents
concerning the bids are ready.

367
00:23:45,925 --> 00:23:47,445
Tell me about it tomorrow.

368
00:23:50,725 --> 00:23:51,685
Why are you laughing?

369
00:23:53,805 --> 00:23:55,085
I just think that

370
00:23:55,405 --> 00:24:00,525
my husband is handsome, amazing,
and I'm proud of his achievements.

371
00:24:02,245 --> 00:24:04,765
If I'm that impressive,
shouldn't you reward me for it?

372
00:24:07,285 --> 00:24:08,845
We can't. We're in your office.

373
00:24:09,165 --> 00:24:11,245
What's so bad about
doing this in the office?

374
00:24:11,565 --> 00:24:12,445
We just can't.

375
00:24:13,005 --> 00:24:13,885
Director Ling.

376
00:24:15,485 --> 00:24:17,445
I said, tell me about it tomorrow.

377
00:24:17,525 --> 00:24:19,885
Director Ling, sorry to bother you...

378
00:24:19,965 --> 00:24:21,125
Do you want to get fired?

379
00:24:21,485 --> 00:24:22,445
No...

380
00:24:25,005 --> 00:24:26,525
No one will bother us now.

381
00:24:27,645 --> 00:24:30,085
Ling Yizhou, when are you going to retire?

382
00:24:30,925 --> 00:24:33,685
I want to live with you
in the middle of nowhere,

383
00:24:33,765 --> 00:24:35,205
and cut you off from the world.

384
00:24:35,845 --> 00:24:38,765
Then, no one will steal you from me.

385
00:24:40,325 --> 00:24:41,885
You're talking nonsense. Let's continue.

386
00:24:41,965 --> 00:24:42,805
Hold on.

387
00:24:46,685 --> 00:24:47,525
You promise?

388
00:24:49,805 --> 00:24:50,645
Let's go.

389
00:25:37,525 --> 00:25:38,525
Mrs. Ling.

390
00:25:38,605 --> 00:25:40,085
Linlin, sorry to bother you.

391
00:25:41,085 --> 00:25:42,845
Mrs. Ling, it's so early. Are you OK?

392
00:25:44,165 --> 00:25:46,565
I made some breakfast food
that Yizhou loved as a child.

393
00:25:46,645 --> 00:25:47,845
I just came to drop it off.

394
00:25:48,645 --> 00:25:50,845
Your hands are cold.
You must have waited a long time.

395
00:25:51,205 --> 00:25:52,045
It's alright.

396
00:25:52,125 --> 00:25:54,085
I didn't have anything else to do anyway.

397
00:25:54,165 --> 00:25:56,205
Go back in before you catch a cold.
I'll leave now.

398
00:25:57,005 --> 00:25:58,205
How about this, Mrs. Ling?

399
00:25:58,285 --> 00:26:00,725
You can come at noon to cook lunch.

400
00:26:01,805 --> 00:26:02,645
Would that be OK?

401
00:26:02,925 --> 00:26:03,765
Of course.

402
00:26:17,725 --> 00:26:18,605
Mumu?

403
00:26:25,205 --> 00:26:26,045
You're up?

404
00:26:28,965 --> 00:26:30,085
Why are you hugging me?

405
00:26:30,805 --> 00:26:32,565
I travelled miles looking for my wife.

406
00:26:32,965 --> 00:26:34,845
Why have you kidnapped my wife?

407
00:26:35,165 --> 00:26:36,565
Go freshen up.

408
00:26:36,965 --> 00:26:39,685
Your wife will be cooking for you today.

409
00:26:40,085 --> 00:26:41,885
It's guaranteed to amaze your taste buds.

410
00:26:43,045 --> 00:26:43,885
Go on.

411
00:26:47,845 --> 00:26:49,245
Try this soup dumpling.

412
00:27:00,565 --> 00:27:02,965
What's up? It's not good?

413
00:27:04,365 --> 00:27:05,405
That's impossible.

414
00:27:10,245 --> 00:27:11,885
It does taste a little fishy.

415
00:27:14,165 --> 00:27:16,885
I woke up early to make this,
so you have to finish it all.

416
00:27:21,485 --> 00:27:23,005
How did you learn to make dumplings?

417
00:27:24,365 --> 00:27:26,325
I... I looked it up online.

418
00:27:26,965 --> 00:27:29,005
This is the first time I've made it.
Does it taste OK?

419
00:27:30,845 --> 00:27:32,285
It tastes a bit like my childhood.

420
00:27:34,845 --> 00:27:37,205
Pidan, are you hungry?
What do you want to eat?

421
00:27:37,285 --> 00:27:39,285
Mommy is going to feed you.
Are you hungry?

422
00:27:39,725 --> 00:27:41,445
Why do you treat the dog
just as good as me?

423
00:27:41,525 --> 00:27:44,285
-I need to check to see how he's feeling.
-What about how I feel?

424
00:27:45,245 --> 00:27:47,925
You're jealous of a dog?
You think I talk with you less than him?

425
00:27:48,005 --> 00:27:50,885
Let me ask you this. Who would you
save first if we were both drowning?

426
00:27:51,285 --> 00:27:54,845
You could be on the Chinese swimming team,
so of course I'd save Pidan.

427
00:27:55,725 --> 00:27:57,005
Wrong answer. Try again.

428
00:27:57,325 --> 00:27:58,925
What are you trying to ask me?

429
00:27:59,485 --> 00:28:02,045
If your mom and I were drowning,
who would you save first?

430
00:28:04,525 --> 00:28:07,045
I feel like you've never talked
about your mom before.

431
00:28:10,925 --> 00:28:12,085
Change the question a bit.

432
00:28:12,925 --> 00:28:14,205
Replace my mom with my grandma.

433
00:28:15,005 --> 00:28:16,165
I'd save my grandma first...

434
00:28:18,085 --> 00:28:19,925
because I'll teach you
how to hold your breath.

435
00:28:20,965 --> 00:28:23,125
How do you teach someone
to hold their breath?

436
00:28:24,245 --> 00:28:25,285
You teach her like this.

437
00:28:46,285 --> 00:28:47,325
Mrs. Ling, you're here.

438
00:28:48,645 --> 00:28:49,485
Linlin...

439
00:28:50,765 --> 00:28:51,685
Is this OK?

440
00:28:52,165 --> 00:28:55,165
It will be OK.
Yizhou stays at the office during the day.

441
00:28:55,485 --> 00:28:58,725
I had Ms. Huang go take care of grandma.
She won't be back until tonight.

442
00:29:02,085 --> 00:29:03,765
This is my first time in Yizhou's home.

443
00:29:04,125 --> 00:29:06,765
It feels wonderful.

444
00:29:07,365 --> 00:29:08,405
This dog is...

445
00:29:08,885 --> 00:29:11,245
Yizhou gave me the dog as a gift.
He's called Pidan.

446
00:29:12,165 --> 00:29:15,085
We raised this kind of dog
when Yizhou was a child.

447
00:29:16,005 --> 00:29:17,205
His dad got rid of it.

448
00:29:18,325 --> 00:29:20,245
He's hated animals
ever since that happened.

449
00:29:21,445 --> 00:29:25,245
Yes. When we first got the dog,
we had a big argument over it.

450
00:29:25,685 --> 00:29:26,565
Really?

451
00:29:28,845 --> 00:29:30,605
You know,
I've always been afraid of Yizhou.

452
00:29:30,685 --> 00:29:34,285
I worried he'd become
a cold man like his father.

453
00:29:35,125 --> 00:29:37,005
But I see that
he grew up to be a good person,

454
00:29:37,085 --> 00:29:38,365
so I feel very grateful.

455
00:29:38,725 --> 00:29:41,165
Linlin, thank you.

456
00:29:42,845 --> 00:29:44,405
Mrs. Ling, I bought all the ingredients.

457
00:29:44,485 --> 00:29:46,445
I'll take the food to Yizhou
when it's ready.

458
00:29:47,485 --> 00:29:49,645
He ate the crab roe dumplings
you made this morning.

459
00:29:49,725 --> 00:29:51,325
He said they tasted like his childhood.

460
00:29:51,405 --> 00:29:52,685
-Really?
-Yeah.

461
00:29:54,085 --> 00:29:56,485
Our memories can be fuzzy,
but taste never is.

462
00:29:56,565 --> 00:29:58,485
Nobody forgets the taste
of their mother's food.

463
00:29:59,405 --> 00:30:01,605
Mrs. Ling, I want to learn from you
while you're cooking.

464
00:30:02,165 --> 00:30:03,645
Sounds good.

465
00:30:06,525 --> 00:30:09,205
The next slide features data analysis
for the first half of the year.

466
00:30:09,845 --> 00:30:11,445
Based on these figures, we can see that

467
00:30:11,525 --> 00:30:12,765
compared to last June...

468
00:30:12,845 --> 00:30:14,405
<i>Will you be at the office at noon?</i>

469
00:30:18,605 --> 00:30:19,845
<i>I will. What's up?</i>

470
00:30:24,005 --> 00:30:25,445
<i>I can't just ask how you're doing?</i>

471
00:30:30,085 --> 00:30:32,125
ONE MESSAGE REMOVED

472
00:30:37,605 --> 00:30:38,805
<i>That's more like it.</i>

473
00:30:39,165 --> 00:30:41,485
<i>Keep your distance</i>
<i>from that female secretary,</i>

474
00:30:41,805 --> 00:30:44,085
<i>because I'll pop in from time to time.</i>

475
00:30:46,445 --> 00:30:48,405
<i>I'll do as you wish, my lovely wife.</i>

476
00:30:54,045 --> 00:30:55,805
<i>Be a good boy. I miss you.</i>

477
00:31:03,325 --> 00:31:04,165
Keep going.

478
00:31:19,525 --> 00:31:20,405
Wen Li...

479
00:31:22,085 --> 00:31:23,925
I left the bid information at home.

480
00:31:24,245 --> 00:31:26,165
-Go get it for me at noon.
-Got it, Mr. Ling.

481
00:31:27,285 --> 00:31:28,805
Never mind.

482
00:31:30,205 --> 00:31:31,885
I'll get it myself. You don't need to go.

483
00:31:32,445 --> 00:31:34,125
It's alright. It's not an inconvenience.

484
00:31:34,605 --> 00:31:36,445
Someone at home misses me.
Why should you go?

485
00:31:39,165 --> 00:31:41,245
Do you know what it's like
to have someone miss you?

486
00:31:42,485 --> 00:31:43,525
Is anyone missing you?

487
00:31:48,725 --> 00:31:50,045
I knew it.

488
00:32:05,005 --> 00:32:05,845
Linlin...

489
00:32:06,765 --> 00:32:08,725
tell me something about Yizhou.

490
00:32:10,245 --> 00:32:11,365
What do you want to hear?

491
00:32:11,845 --> 00:32:13,245
Is he healthy?

492
00:32:13,925 --> 00:32:15,845
Are there any problems at the company?

493
00:32:16,765 --> 00:32:18,125
What are his hobbies?

494
00:32:19,045 --> 00:32:22,365
He works out every morning,
so he's really healthy.

495
00:32:22,845 --> 00:32:23,725
He never gets sick.

496
00:32:24,445 --> 00:32:26,605
I don't know much about his work.

497
00:32:27,205 --> 00:32:28,245
As for his hobbies,

498
00:32:28,765 --> 00:32:31,285
he used to only love work.
Now he has a dog to walk.

499
00:32:31,685 --> 00:32:32,645
Oh, really?

500
00:32:36,845 --> 00:32:38,685
I don't know if his taste buds
have changed.

501
00:32:39,125 --> 00:32:42,125
I can tell you that he's really picky.

502
00:32:42,805 --> 00:32:44,645
There are so many vegetables he won't eat,

503
00:32:44,725 --> 00:32:46,325
and he doesn't like spicy food.

504
00:32:47,125 --> 00:32:51,365
That's because as a child he had an
eczema flare-up after eating spicy food.

505
00:32:52,005 --> 00:32:53,165
He had rashes all over,

506
00:32:53,565 --> 00:32:54,965
so he never ate spicy food again.

507
00:32:55,925 --> 00:32:56,965
That explains it.

508
00:32:57,285 --> 00:33:00,325
Sometimes he eats spicy food now,
but nothing happens.

509
00:33:00,765 --> 00:33:03,765
That's because he grew up.
His immune system is stronger now.

510
00:33:09,565 --> 00:33:10,405
Mrs. Ling.

511
00:33:11,245 --> 00:33:12,405
What's wrong?

512
00:33:13,085 --> 00:33:14,565
I need to use the bathroom.

513
00:33:15,245 --> 00:33:16,285
Are you OK?

514
00:33:36,445 --> 00:33:37,285
Linlin.

515
00:33:38,925 --> 00:33:40,005
Why are you here?

516
00:33:48,445 --> 00:33:49,805
Yizhou, why are you home?

517
00:33:49,885 --> 00:33:52,285
Explain to me why this person
is in my home right now!

518
00:33:53,245 --> 00:33:54,845
-I...
-Don't blame Linlin for this.

519
00:33:55,565 --> 00:33:56,485
I begged her.

520
00:33:57,045 --> 00:33:58,685
I just wanted to make you some good food.

521
00:33:59,925 --> 00:34:01,765
So you made
the crab roe dumplings this morning?

522
00:34:05,325 --> 00:34:08,805
I was perfectly clear
that I never wanted to see you again.

523
00:34:09,365 --> 00:34:11,485
Please leave right now.

524
00:34:12,445 --> 00:34:15,045
-Yizhou, don't do this. She's your mother.
-Just be quiet!

525
00:34:19,365 --> 00:34:21,445
On the day my father died, I told you

526
00:34:22,445 --> 00:34:24,525
that I wanted nothing
to do with you anymore.

527
00:34:24,605 --> 00:34:26,405
Anything you do right now means nothing.

528
00:34:26,965 --> 00:34:28,244
I'm sure I've been clear enough.

529
00:34:29,085 --> 00:34:31,965
Yizhou, Linlin is a good girl.

530
00:34:32,485 --> 00:34:33,405
Don't blow up at her.

531
00:34:33,485 --> 00:34:35,605
I don't need an outsider
dealing with family issues!

532
00:34:37,365 --> 00:34:38,525
Get out.

533
00:34:40,485 --> 00:34:41,565
Get out!

534
00:34:57,565 --> 00:34:59,085
Mrs. Ling...

535
00:36:07,445 --> 00:36:09,805
Mumu, what happened to your finger?
Does it hurt? Let me see.

536
00:36:10,365 --> 00:36:12,485
Don't talk to me.
It doesn't matter how bad it hurts.

537
00:36:13,765 --> 00:36:15,685
This afternoon was my fault.
Please forgive me.

538
00:36:22,325 --> 00:36:23,765
You were so mean to me today.

539
00:36:24,685 --> 00:36:26,645
I'm sorry that I lost my temper.

540
00:36:27,805 --> 00:36:29,605
I burnt my hand.

541
00:36:30,645 --> 00:36:32,405
I'll burn my hand too
if you stop being mad.

542
00:36:32,485 --> 00:36:35,445
What are you talking about?
I wouldn't let you do that.

543
00:36:37,885 --> 00:36:38,725
Yizhou,

544
00:36:39,445 --> 00:36:41,445
one day, I noticed
someone following me around.

545
00:36:41,925 --> 00:36:42,845
I found out it was her.

546
00:36:44,645 --> 00:36:48,525
So I had Wen Li look up her address
and went to meet her.

547
00:36:50,045 --> 00:36:52,725
I just wanted to understand you better.

548
00:36:53,605 --> 00:36:56,525
You never talk about her
and you don't let Ms. Huang mention her.

549
00:36:57,005 --> 00:36:59,285
It's like she became our family's taboo.

550
00:37:00,885 --> 00:37:02,925
Yizhou, this isn't normal.

551
00:37:04,565 --> 00:37:06,885
Maybe you still hold
a grudge about the past,

552
00:37:07,485 --> 00:37:09,285
but she has her own pain as well.

553
00:37:09,965 --> 00:37:11,925
Plus, she's your mom.

554
00:37:12,005 --> 00:37:12,845
What's her pain?

555
00:37:14,645 --> 00:37:17,565
If she loved me, then why did she leave me
and my dad for another man?

556
00:37:18,765 --> 00:37:19,885
That's not love at all.

557
00:37:23,205 --> 00:37:25,125
Do you know why I hate my birthday?

558
00:37:25,845 --> 00:37:28,885
It's because she left me
on the day I turned eight.

559
00:37:33,285 --> 00:37:34,205
This robot...

560
00:37:35,445 --> 00:37:37,085
was the first gift she ever gave me,

561
00:37:37,805 --> 00:37:39,165
and it was the last one as well.

562
00:37:41,445 --> 00:37:45,245
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

563
00:37:45,805 --> 00:37:50,245
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

564
00:37:50,605 --> 00:37:54,445
<i>Happy birthday, dear Yizhou</i>

565
00:37:54,885 --> 00:37:56,285
Here's your gift.

566
00:38:00,045 --> 00:38:02,885
<i>That day I cried, I screamed,</i>
<i>I begged her not to leave.</i>

567
00:38:04,725 --> 00:38:06,325
<i>But she didn't even look back at me.</i>

568
00:38:15,885 --> 00:38:18,085
Even though that robot
got smashed to pieces...

569
00:38:19,965 --> 00:38:21,165
I still don't know why...

570
00:38:22,485 --> 00:38:24,365
I've never been able
to throw this photo away.

571
00:38:27,845 --> 00:38:29,485
When I was little, I'd always wonder...

572
00:38:31,045 --> 00:38:32,685
if it was because I wasn't good enough.

573
00:38:34,485 --> 00:38:37,485
I wasn't good enough.
That's why she left me without any qualms.

574
00:38:41,485 --> 00:38:44,445
I'm sorry.
I didn't know about any of this.

575
00:38:46,125 --> 00:38:47,605
I became a very obedient child.

576
00:38:50,005 --> 00:38:52,245
I did whatever my father told me to do.

577
00:38:54,085 --> 00:38:57,125
But I always hoped
that she'd come back to see me again.

578
00:39:00,765 --> 00:39:02,285
But she never came back, not once.

579
00:39:06,325 --> 00:39:07,725
And I was just so disappointed.

580
00:39:10,125 --> 00:39:11,005
Over time...

581
00:39:12,485 --> 00:39:14,245
that disappointment turned into hate.

582
00:39:14,685 --> 00:39:16,045
That's right, I hated her.

583
00:39:19,005 --> 00:39:20,085
It's OK.

584
00:39:20,525 --> 00:39:22,925
We don't have to see her
if you don't want to.

585
00:39:23,685 --> 00:39:26,685
I'll always be with you anyway.

586
00:39:33,725 --> 00:39:35,885
I'm sorry.

587
00:40:39,125 --> 00:40:39,965
Mumu...

588
00:40:41,925 --> 00:40:43,285
I used to be so afraid.

589
00:40:44,725 --> 00:40:46,125
I was afraid to face her.

590
00:40:49,965 --> 00:40:52,045
To me, she was like a scab.

591
00:40:52,925 --> 00:40:55,685
I could pretend it didn't exist
as long as I didn't pick at it.

592
00:40:58,085 --> 00:40:59,885
I was afraid the wound was too big.

593
00:41:02,005 --> 00:41:04,205
That it would never be able to fully heal.

594
00:41:08,965 --> 00:41:10,165
But I'm not afraid anymore...

595
00:41:13,125 --> 00:41:14,445
because I have you at my side.

596
00:41:17,925 --> 00:41:18,925
Yizhou.

597
00:41:21,565 --> 00:41:23,325
You should invite her
to come here tomorrow.

598
00:41:24,885 --> 00:41:25,925
What?

599
00:41:27,165 --> 00:41:28,885
Eventually, I need to fix this, right?

600
00:41:30,445 --> 00:41:35,045
I have you at my side anyways,
so I've got nothing to fear.

601
00:41:36,725 --> 00:41:39,005
So you're willing to have
a heart-to-heart chat with her?

602
00:41:39,605 --> 00:41:42,725
Didn't I promise you
I'd never lie to you again, silly girl?

603
00:41:48,365 --> 00:41:49,245
Ling Yizhou...

604
00:41:50,405 --> 00:41:54,205
do I keep forgetting
to finally tell you...

605
00:41:56,485 --> 00:41:57,445
that I love you?

606
00:42:00,805 --> 00:42:02,365
I know it even if you don't say it.

607
00:42:03,525 --> 00:42:04,405
But Mumu...

608
00:42:07,365 --> 00:42:08,325
I love you even more.

609
00:42:23,565 --> 00:42:26,125
Hurry up and close the door.
Ms. Huang just saw us.

610
00:42:26,525 --> 00:42:28,485
It's alright. She can understand this.

611
00:42:28,725 --> 00:42:31,045
I'm so embarrassed.

612
00:42:31,125 --> 00:42:32,605
-This is all your fault.
-My fault?

613
00:42:33,205 --> 00:42:36,485
I didn't even get to eat one cherry.
I'm hungry.

614
00:42:37,125 --> 00:42:40,165
Did you know that I'm hungry, too?

615
00:42:47,765 --> 00:42:48,845
Is this domestic violence?

616
00:42:49,445 --> 00:42:53,285
What will you do about it?
I'll keep it up if you keep being bad.

617
00:42:59,365 --> 00:43:00,765
You said you'll keep it up?

618
00:43:02,645 --> 00:43:04,445
Ling Yizhou, you're such a pervert.

619
00:43:06,045 --> 00:43:08,845
Did you say that on purpose?

620
00:44:44,525 --> 00:44:46,285
Subtitle translation by Luke Deming

621
00:44:46,365 --> 00:44:47,245
Why are you here?

622
00:44:47,685 --> 00:44:50,165
Is this how you treat your guests?

623
00:44:50,525 --> 00:44:51,405
Nan?

624
00:44:51,725 --> 00:44:52,885
Long time no see...

625
00:44:55,685 --> 00:44:56,645
Mom.

626

<i>"Ling Yizhou of Lingshi Group indifferent</i>
<i>towards his biological mother..."</i>

627
00:45:04,525 --> 00:45:06,045
Sir, I've investigated

628
00:45:06,125 --> 00:45:08,645
the source of the news article,
but the contributor was anonymous.

629
00:45:09,725 --> 00:45:11,485
I think you should go to the hospital.

630
00:45:11,925 --> 00:45:14,525
You might... be pregnant.
