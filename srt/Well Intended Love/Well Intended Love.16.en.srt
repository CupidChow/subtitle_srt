1
00:00:12,885 --> 00:00:14,805
You know that Chu Yan likes you.

2
00:00:15,045 --> 00:00:16,005
You...

3
00:00:17,165 --> 00:00:20,365
I only noticed it
at the brand launch event.

4
00:00:21,485 --> 00:00:24,165
Even if you were
the last woman in the world...

5
00:00:25,165 --> 00:00:26,365
I'd rather be with Ling.

6
00:00:27,005 --> 00:00:28,765
Screw you. Ling Yizhou is mine.

7
00:00:28,845 --> 00:00:29,725
Mrs. Ling,

8
00:00:29,805 --> 00:00:34,165
nobody would hate their own mother
for no reason.

9
00:00:34,765 --> 00:00:36,845
Please leave right now.

10
00:00:39,005 --> 00:00:39,845
Now!

11
00:00:41,565 --> 00:00:45,325
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

12
00:02:12,205 --> 00:02:15,165
EPISODE 16

13
00:02:29,925 --> 00:02:31,005
That's way too sour.

14
00:02:31,085 --> 00:02:33,125
Is it? I think it tastes just right.

15
00:02:38,245 --> 00:02:39,365
I think Mrs. Ling is here.

16
00:02:46,205 --> 00:02:47,045
Mrs. Ling.

17
00:02:53,445 --> 00:02:55,085
Yizhou, she's here.

18
00:02:56,645 --> 00:02:57,645
Yizhou.

19
00:02:58,925 --> 00:03:01,445
How about you go sit on the sofa?
I'll get you some water.

20
00:03:07,605 --> 00:03:08,445
Yizhou.

21
00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:14,285
Linlin is a nice girl.

22
00:03:15,885 --> 00:03:18,685
She's beautiful and kind.

23
00:03:23,205 --> 00:03:24,925
Let's go sit over there.

24
00:03:25,005 --> 00:03:26,125
OK.

25
00:03:33,605 --> 00:03:35,125
-Here's your water.
-Thanks.

26
00:03:35,805 --> 00:03:36,725
By the way...

27
00:03:39,485 --> 00:03:40,325
Linlin,

28
00:03:40,885 --> 00:03:43,565
I never sent a gift when you got married.

29
00:03:43,925 --> 00:03:46,405
Please take this. It's just a simple gift.

30
00:03:51,085 --> 00:03:52,725
I can't take it. It's too much.

31
00:03:52,965 --> 00:03:56,885
It's just a little something
for my daughter-in-law.

32
00:03:57,285 --> 00:03:59,205
My wife doesn't need jewelry.

33
00:04:08,005 --> 00:04:08,925
Go see who it is.

34
00:04:15,125 --> 00:04:16,045
Don't listen to him.

35
00:04:19,885 --> 00:04:20,725
Hi.

36
00:04:23,524 --> 00:04:24,365
Why are you here?

37
00:04:24,805 --> 00:04:27,285
Is this how you treat your guests?

38
00:04:29,005 --> 00:04:31,365
You're just going to talk to me outside?

39
00:04:34,245 --> 00:04:35,405
What do you want?

40
00:04:42,325 --> 00:04:43,845
Nan?

41
00:04:43,925 --> 00:04:45,085
Long time no see...

42
00:04:47,925 --> 00:04:48,765
Mom.

43
00:04:56,005 --> 00:04:57,485
Oh, my gosh.

44
00:04:57,805 --> 00:05:01,565
It's so early.
Whoever it is should let me sleep.

45
00:05:04,845 --> 00:05:06,805
What? Why are you here?

46
00:05:06,885 --> 00:05:08,285
Why didn't you call me first?

47
00:05:09,325 --> 00:05:10,525
Oh, my gosh.

48
00:05:13,365 --> 00:05:15,645
Last time you treated me.
It's my turn today.

49
00:05:16,605 --> 00:05:17,765
The kitchen is over there.

50
00:05:26,205 --> 00:05:27,085
Don't look at me.

51
00:05:29,205 --> 00:05:30,605
Don't look at me.

52
00:05:31,765 --> 00:05:33,205
Maybe you could clean up a bit.

53
00:05:33,285 --> 00:05:34,245
I mean you yourself.

54
00:05:44,725 --> 00:05:46,725
Mom, have some more.

55
00:05:47,765 --> 00:05:49,645
You must miss Ms. Huang's cooking.

56
00:05:59,325 --> 00:06:00,605
Why do you keep looking at me?

57
00:06:01,605 --> 00:06:03,045
I still can't believe that

58
00:06:03,885 --> 00:06:05,645
you and Yizhou are related.

59
00:06:07,045 --> 00:06:08,205
Jintian is my stepson.

60
00:06:08,605 --> 00:06:09,445
We're not related.

61
00:06:14,605 --> 00:06:16,645
We aren't related biologically,

62
00:06:17,005 --> 00:06:18,925
but I've always seen you as my brother.

63
00:06:19,365 --> 00:06:20,885
Right, big brother?

64
00:06:21,765 --> 00:06:24,245
No need for that. Please stop.

65
00:06:24,925 --> 00:06:26,645
Jintian, are you done?

66
00:06:26,725 --> 00:06:28,685
-Let's go.
-No rush, Mom.

67
00:06:31,805 --> 00:06:34,365
She's missed you all these years.

68
00:06:35,805 --> 00:06:38,165
I often catch her looking at your photos.

69
00:06:39,685 --> 00:06:41,365
She treats me well,

70
00:06:41,885 --> 00:06:42,845
but I know that...

71
00:06:43,925 --> 00:06:45,565
she's just projecting her feelings on me.

72
00:06:45,885 --> 00:06:48,165
The person she misses is you.

73
00:06:48,365 --> 00:06:49,445
Jintian.

74
00:06:49,725 --> 00:06:50,565
Mom.

75
00:06:51,965 --> 00:06:53,005
He should know about this.

76
00:06:54,405 --> 00:06:55,845
You haven't been back here,

77
00:06:56,605 --> 00:06:58,005
but you haven't missed out on much.

78
00:06:59,165 --> 00:07:02,685
She even found out that...
you got married right after it happened.

79
00:07:03,885 --> 00:07:05,965
Is that so? You've been watching me?

80
00:07:06,405 --> 00:07:07,765
No, Yizhou. I was just--

81
00:07:07,845 --> 00:07:09,045
Mom was just worried about you.

82
00:07:09,765 --> 00:07:10,605
Are you done?

83
00:07:12,725 --> 00:07:14,965
I don't need your pretentious concern.

84
00:07:16,565 --> 00:07:18,965
If you're done, you can leave now.

85
00:07:19,445 --> 00:07:21,725
I can't stand watching the two of you

86
00:07:22,245 --> 00:07:23,965
acting like a loving family.

87
00:07:24,445 --> 00:07:26,725
Yizhou, it's not like that.

88
00:07:29,645 --> 00:07:33,565
Mrs. Ling... I'll walk you outside.

89
00:07:53,805 --> 00:07:55,445
I'll help you.

90
00:08:01,125 --> 00:08:02,165
Help me with what?

91
00:08:03,325 --> 00:08:04,245
After all,

92
00:08:05,125 --> 00:08:06,445
we are brothers.

93
00:08:06,885 --> 00:08:08,005
Right, brother?

94
00:08:28,405 --> 00:08:32,245
It might take him some time to come round.

95
00:08:32,805 --> 00:08:35,045
I know. I don't blame him.

96
00:08:35,925 --> 00:08:38,765
The situation is kind of complicated.

97
00:08:39,445 --> 00:08:41,044
You know Jintian?

98
00:08:41,285 --> 00:08:43,285
Yes, by chance.

99
00:08:44,164 --> 00:08:45,005
Nan.

100
00:08:46,325 --> 00:08:47,645
My full name is Nan Jintian.

101
00:08:48,205 --> 00:08:49,044
I'm sorry.

102
00:08:49,765 --> 00:08:52,925
My brother pretends I don't exist,
so I didn't tell you.

103
00:08:54,205 --> 00:08:57,365
It's fine. I was just surprised.

104
00:08:58,045 --> 00:09:00,525
It's pretty complicated.
I'll tell you next time.

105
00:09:01,325 --> 00:09:02,365
OK.

106
00:09:02,685 --> 00:09:03,525
Mother...

107
00:09:04,645 --> 00:09:05,645
want to visit my place?

108
00:09:06,165 --> 00:09:07,005
No.

109
00:09:07,405 --> 00:09:08,645
Take you to your hotel, then?

110
00:09:13,765 --> 00:09:14,805
Sure.

111
00:09:16,285 --> 00:09:17,165
See you next time.

112
00:09:17,645 --> 00:09:18,485
OK.

113
00:09:24,525 --> 00:09:25,605
How do you know him?

114
00:09:26,925 --> 00:09:28,565
You mean Nan?

115
00:09:29,405 --> 00:09:32,205
I first met him
when I was shopping at the mall.

116
00:09:32,285 --> 00:09:34,845
Then I found out he lives nearby.

117
00:09:35,525 --> 00:09:36,725
Eleven is his dog.

118
00:09:40,885 --> 00:09:42,165
Don't be mad at me.

119
00:09:44,645 --> 00:09:45,485
Why?

120
00:09:46,005 --> 00:09:49,365
Because then I have to make you happy.

121
00:09:51,765 --> 00:09:52,885
How will you do that?

122
00:10:01,685 --> 00:10:03,565
Did that work?

123
00:10:10,165 --> 00:10:11,045
It did. Immediately.

124
00:10:29,805 --> 00:10:31,805
I'm here. You can leave now.

125
00:10:32,525 --> 00:10:35,085
You're not going to invite me in, Mom?

126
00:10:36,005 --> 00:10:37,485
What do you want?

127
00:10:38,925 --> 00:10:40,125
What do I want?

128
00:10:47,205 --> 00:10:49,645
Haven't you always known what I want?

129
00:10:50,605 --> 00:10:51,725
Let go.

130
00:10:55,085 --> 00:10:56,045
Let go.

131
00:11:03,605 --> 00:11:06,925
Don't worry. I won't hurt you right now.

132
00:11:07,565 --> 00:11:10,285
If I hurt you, Dad will ask me about it.

133
00:11:13,245 --> 00:11:14,325
Leave Yizhou alone.

134
00:11:20,965 --> 00:11:24,365
Sorry, I can't promise you that.

135
00:11:25,445 --> 00:11:27,205
He's my new toy.

136
00:11:29,205 --> 00:11:30,925
Don't you dare hurt him.

137
00:11:37,485 --> 00:11:40,525
Then show me what
you'd be willing to do...

138
00:11:41,645 --> 00:11:42,925
to protect him.

139
00:11:44,325 --> 00:11:45,965
I have to remind you though...

140
00:11:47,125 --> 00:11:48,485
no matter what you do...

141
00:11:49,565 --> 00:11:51,005
you can't stop me.

142
00:11:52,525 --> 00:11:56,205
One day, I'll let you see him...

143
00:11:57,485 --> 00:11:58,925
kneeling before me.

144
00:12:00,645 --> 00:12:02,405
I feel so excited just thinking about...

145
00:12:03,885 --> 00:12:05,565
the expression on his face.

146
00:12:15,725 --> 00:12:18,165
Don't forget to watch TV, Mother.

147
00:12:38,485 --> 00:12:41,845
I think that if you ever left Lingshi,
you could open your own restaurant.

148
00:12:42,445 --> 00:12:44,845
I guarantee that it would be a hit.

149
00:12:44,925 --> 00:12:45,925
I'll never leave Lingshi.

150
00:12:47,165 --> 00:12:50,925
Nobody stays at one company
their whole life nowadays.

151
00:12:51,245 --> 00:12:52,085
I will.

152
00:12:53,925 --> 00:12:57,605
You don't have to give him everything.

153
00:12:58,965 --> 00:13:00,405
Mr. Ling has helped me so much.

154
00:13:00,485 --> 00:13:02,085
I'm just fulfilling my duty.

155
00:13:02,965 --> 00:13:04,965
You don't have to promise yourself to him.

156
00:13:06,085 --> 00:13:07,165
What do you mean?

157
00:13:07,245 --> 00:13:09,525
How many years have you been by his side?

158
00:13:09,725 --> 00:13:10,565
Eight years.

159
00:13:12,005 --> 00:13:14,245
Eight years. That's like forever.

160
00:13:14,805 --> 00:13:16,925
Please, just give up.

161
00:13:17,525 --> 00:13:21,725
I know that Mr. Ling
really is quite handsome,

162
00:13:22,125 --> 00:13:23,645
but he's married now.

163
00:13:23,965 --> 00:13:28,445
If you don't give up on him,
you'll end up all alone.

164
00:13:30,085 --> 00:13:30,925
What do you mean?

165
00:13:32,605 --> 00:13:33,445
I mean,

166
00:13:34,165 --> 00:13:36,125
you haven't been able
to seduce him in eight years.

167
00:13:36,365 --> 00:13:38,525
That means he's a straight man.

168
00:13:38,605 --> 00:13:39,525
Just give up.

169
00:13:40,685 --> 00:13:43,165
You think I'm in love with Mr. Ling?

170
00:13:45,205 --> 00:13:48,725
No need to hide it. I know everything.

171
00:13:49,405 --> 00:13:52,525
Nobody else is like you,
always being so nice to their boss.

172
00:13:52,965 --> 00:13:56,365
You take care of him
at the company and in private.

173
00:13:57,285 --> 00:14:00,005
I think you should leave Lingshi soon.

174
00:14:00,565 --> 00:14:03,965
If you don't see him every day,
you'll eventually forget him.

175
00:14:04,245 --> 00:14:05,285
No.

176
00:14:07,005 --> 00:14:09,885
What's wrong with you? Huh?

177
00:14:09,965 --> 00:14:12,085
Oh, my God. I'm done with you.

178
00:14:19,165 --> 00:14:21,405
What are you doing?

179
00:14:22,245 --> 00:14:24,125
Proving my personal orientation.

180
00:14:26,045 --> 00:14:28,285
So, you're not...

181
00:14:30,085 --> 00:14:31,205
That's impossible.

182
00:14:31,525 --> 00:14:33,485
Why are you so nice to Ling Yizhou then?

183
00:14:33,765 --> 00:14:35,445
Why do you want to work there forever?

184
00:14:36,645 --> 00:14:39,765
Without Lingshi's funding,
I wouldn't have completed my studies.

185
00:14:40,565 --> 00:14:43,245
Without Mr. Ling's help,
I wouldn't be where I am today.

186
00:14:43,885 --> 00:14:47,365
So you're paying him back?

187
00:14:48,845 --> 00:14:50,005
You could say that.

188
00:15:01,805 --> 00:15:05,645
<i>"Ling Yizhou of Lingshi Group indifferent</i>
<i>towards his biological mother..."</i>

189
00:15:42,845 --> 00:15:43,845
This is all my fault.

190
00:15:44,685 --> 00:15:46,565
If I had minded my own business,

191
00:15:47,125 --> 00:15:48,885
none of this would have happened.

192
00:15:50,205 --> 00:15:52,285
It's not your fault. Don't worry.

193
00:15:52,485 --> 00:15:54,565
PR will take care of it.

194
00:15:56,645 --> 00:15:58,045
I've always wanted to ask...

195
00:15:58,765 --> 00:16:01,525
What happened between you and Nan?

196
00:16:04,605 --> 00:16:06,725
When we were kids, he lived next door.

197
00:16:07,765 --> 00:16:10,365
We were about the same age,
so we played together.

198
00:16:11,645 --> 00:16:14,045
So he knows Chu Yan and An Ran as well?

199
00:16:16,685 --> 00:16:18,245
Then why did you...

200
00:16:22,965 --> 00:16:24,605
After his mother died...

201
00:16:26,445 --> 00:16:27,285
he...

202
00:16:28,725 --> 00:16:30,205
He went to live with his dad.

203
00:16:31,965 --> 00:16:33,565
On my eighth birthday...

204
00:16:36,045 --> 00:16:37,525
they moved abroad.

205
00:16:59,205 --> 00:17:00,245
Yizhou...

206
00:17:00,725 --> 00:17:01,645
Yizhou...

207
00:17:02,325 --> 00:17:03,525
What are you thinking about?

208
00:17:06,365 --> 00:17:07,565
Stay away from Nan Jintian.

209
00:17:07,645 --> 00:17:08,565
Why?

210
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:10,565
I've told you before...

211
00:17:11,885 --> 00:17:13,885
He created all the coincidences.

212
00:17:14,965 --> 00:17:17,124
How you met him was too much
of a coincidence to be true.

213
00:17:17,844 --> 00:17:19,725
I think he's being strange.

214
00:17:20,765 --> 00:17:23,005
You think he approached me on purpose?

215
00:17:23,285 --> 00:17:24,525
But that doesn't make sense.

216
00:17:24,604 --> 00:17:26,324
Why would he do that?

217
00:17:27,245 --> 00:17:28,124
Do you know him well?

218
00:17:28,844 --> 00:17:30,485
We're not strangers.

219
00:17:31,445 --> 00:17:32,885
We haven't met many times,

220
00:17:32,965 --> 00:17:36,685
but I've always thought he was
a gentleman. Very considerate.

221
00:17:37,765 --> 00:17:39,405
When you lost your memory,

222
00:17:39,765 --> 00:17:41,525
he gave me a lot of guidance.

223
00:17:46,445 --> 00:17:49,005
Alright, I'll do what you want.

224
00:17:49,085 --> 00:17:50,605
I'll stay away from him.

225
00:17:50,965 --> 00:17:52,045
Really?

226
00:17:52,485 --> 00:17:54,805
-Yes.
-But I don't have a legitimate reason.

227
00:17:56,365 --> 00:17:59,525
No matter what the reason is,
I'm sure you're just looking out for me.

228
00:18:00,485 --> 00:18:05,125
You're much more important to me
than he is.

229
00:18:21,805 --> 00:18:23,685
The news article came out too suddenly,

230
00:18:24,085 --> 00:18:26,005
so we couldn't take it down in time.

231
00:18:26,085 --> 00:18:28,365
Now it has been shared
too many times already to react.

232
00:18:29,085 --> 00:18:30,525
The stocks have been affected.

233
00:18:30,605 --> 00:18:32,445
We took a hit this morning at opening.

234
00:18:32,525 --> 00:18:35,245
Also, it's a sensitive time
for our cooperation with Zhuoyuan Group.

235
00:18:35,325 --> 00:18:37,325
Last night, they called to ask about it.

236
00:18:38,325 --> 00:18:40,765
The legal department should make
an official announcement.

237
00:18:41,325 --> 00:18:44,205
Or, Mr. Ling, you could post
an announcement on social media.

238
00:18:45,445 --> 00:18:49,325
The best solution would be
for Mrs. Ling to make a statement.

239
00:18:53,645 --> 00:18:55,325
I don't care what you do.

240
00:18:55,925 --> 00:18:58,965
Within three days,
make this go away completely.

241
00:19:00,405 --> 00:19:01,245
Mr. Ling.

242
00:19:11,925 --> 00:19:12,765
<i>Hello, everyone.</i>

243
00:19:13,645 --> 00:19:14,925
<i>I am Ling Yizhou's mother.</i>

244
00:19:16,485 --> 00:19:20,805
<i>There has been negative news</i>
<i>directed towards my son lately.</i>

245
00:19:22,125 --> 00:19:25,285
<i>This is the first and also the last time</i>

246
00:19:25,605 --> 00:19:28,405
<i>that I'll respond to this officially.</i>

247
00:19:29,805 --> 00:19:34,365
-<i>My son has done nothing wrong.</i>
-That will be 12.10RMB.

248
00:19:36,645 --> 00:19:38,245
<i>I'm the one who abandoned him.</i>

249
00:19:39,085 --> 00:19:40,245
MOTHER OF LINGSHI DIRECTOR

250
00:19:40,325 --> 00:19:42,525
<i>I haven't fulfilled</i>
<i>a mother's responsibilities.</i>

251
00:19:43,245 --> 00:19:46,925
I have been trying
to repair our relationship.

252
00:19:47,645 --> 00:19:49,005
<i>This is all my fault.</i>

253
00:19:50,485 --> 00:19:52,005
<i>He hasn't done anything wrong.</i>

254
00:19:53,925 --> 00:19:55,205
<i>As a mother,</i>

255
00:19:56,005 --> 00:19:57,885
<i>I missed out on his childhood.</i>

256
00:19:59,005 --> 00:20:00,645
<i>Without a mother,</i>

257
00:20:01,165 --> 00:20:03,765
<i>he has worked hard all by himself,</i>
<i>step by step,</i>

258
00:20:04,645 --> 00:20:06,605
<i>and grown into the man he is today.</i>

259
00:20:09,405 --> 00:20:10,485
<i>I am proud of him.</i>

260
00:20:11,805 --> 00:20:13,045
<i>I am also ashamed of myself.</i>

261
00:20:14,205 --> 00:20:15,805
<i>I hope that we all can be compassionate.</i>

262
00:20:16,285 --> 00:20:18,085
<i>Don't listen to those rumors.</i>

263
00:20:19,685 --> 00:20:22,005
My son, Ling Yizhou...

264
00:20:23,285 --> 00:20:28,085
is a kind, brave, and good man.

265
00:20:30,365 --> 00:20:31,445
<i>Thank you.</i>

266
00:20:37,205 --> 00:20:38,165
You may leave now.

267
00:20:39,525 --> 00:20:40,365
Yes, sir.

268
00:20:45,085 --> 00:20:46,925
Sir, I've investigated

269
00:20:47,005 --> 00:20:49,565
the source of the news article,
but the contributor was anonymous.

270
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:55,685
I don't know how the reporters found
the hotel she's staying at.

271
00:20:57,565 --> 00:20:58,885
I'd like you to keep an eye on

272
00:20:59,645 --> 00:21:01,045
what Nan Jintian has been doing.

273
00:21:01,525 --> 00:21:02,485
Yes, sir.

274
00:21:18,165 --> 00:21:19,005
Xia Lin?

275
00:21:22,325 --> 00:21:23,965
What a coincidence.

276
00:21:24,965 --> 00:21:27,285
Really? This is quite close
to our neighborhood.

277
00:21:28,245 --> 00:21:29,685
Come on. I'll treat you to lunch.

278
00:21:30,205 --> 00:21:31,125
No, thanks.

279
00:21:31,725 --> 00:21:34,005
I have to go to work in a bit.

280
00:21:36,005 --> 00:21:37,365
You're wearing that to work?

281
00:21:39,205 --> 00:21:41,485
Did he tell you to stay away from me?

282
00:21:42,045 --> 00:21:43,885
No. Why would he do that?

283
00:21:58,845 --> 00:22:00,285
Nothing you want to talk about?

284
00:22:02,565 --> 00:22:03,405
No.

285
00:22:06,085 --> 00:22:09,125
Xia Lin, you once told me that

286
00:22:09,485 --> 00:22:10,525
we're friends.

287
00:22:11,005 --> 00:22:11,925
Of course we are.

288
00:22:13,765 --> 00:22:15,925
Then you should be straightforward with me

289
00:22:16,405 --> 00:22:17,925
instead of pushing me away.

290
00:22:19,805 --> 00:22:21,405
I just wanted to ask you...

291
00:22:22,925 --> 00:22:26,485
Did you know who I was when you met me?

292
00:22:30,205 --> 00:22:32,845
You mean, did I approach you

293
00:22:33,765 --> 00:22:34,805
because of Ling Yizhou?

294
00:22:41,845 --> 00:22:43,325
If you think I set everything up...

295
00:22:44,445 --> 00:22:45,725
there's not much I can say.

296
00:22:45,805 --> 00:22:47,805
That's not what I mean.

297
00:22:48,285 --> 00:22:51,805
I just feel like
it was too much of a coincidence.

298
00:22:57,245 --> 00:23:00,565
Yes. I chose that neighborhood

299
00:23:01,445 --> 00:23:02,525
because of him.

300
00:23:04,125 --> 00:23:06,085
Mom always wanted to come see him,

301
00:23:06,925 --> 00:23:09,925
but she was always rejected.
It made her sad.

302
00:23:11,805 --> 00:23:15,445
So I wanted to find a way
to repair their relationship.

303
00:23:16,965 --> 00:23:20,565
As for you and him...
Just like the public,

304
00:23:21,205 --> 00:23:22,565
I only found out from the news.

305
00:23:23,365 --> 00:23:26,205
Why didn't you tell me when you found out?

306
00:23:27,645 --> 00:23:28,725
Because I was worried...

307
00:23:30,405 --> 00:23:32,165
that you would treat me
with this attitude.

308
00:23:34,165 --> 00:23:35,005
I...

309
00:23:35,485 --> 00:23:38,565
Xia Lin, after I found out
about you two...

310
00:23:39,845 --> 00:23:41,845
I regretted telling you to let go.

311
00:23:42,365 --> 00:23:46,245
I'm sorry I misunderstood you.

312
00:23:48,525 --> 00:23:49,365
It's fine.

313
00:23:50,525 --> 00:23:53,805
I should thank you, actually.

314
00:23:54,725 --> 00:23:56,085
Why?

315
00:23:56,885 --> 00:24:00,605
<i>Thank you for being</i>
<i>the chink in Ling Yizhou's armor.</i>

316
00:24:02,605 --> 00:24:04,325
Thanks for still being friends with me.

317
00:24:07,045 --> 00:24:09,485
Alright, let's order now.

318
00:24:10,165 --> 00:24:13,205
This place has the best steaks,
especially medium rare.

319
00:24:18,605 --> 00:24:19,765
You don't like steak?

320
00:24:19,965 --> 00:24:21,085
No...

321
00:24:21,965 --> 00:24:27,285
I've had terrible nausea lately.

322
00:24:27,365 --> 00:24:28,765
Should I take you to a hospital?

323
00:24:29,965 --> 00:24:30,805
No.

324
00:24:36,565 --> 00:24:39,685
Xia Lin, apart from nausea,

325
00:24:40,085 --> 00:24:43,845
have you felt dizzy, tired,
and hungry all the time?

326
00:24:44,445 --> 00:24:46,805
I have. Exactly.

327
00:24:47,045 --> 00:24:48,005
How do you know?

328
00:24:48,645 --> 00:24:50,525
I think you should go to the hospital.

329
00:24:51,005 --> 00:24:52,085
You might be...

330
00:24:52,965 --> 00:24:53,965
pregnant.

331
00:25:12,005 --> 00:25:15,125
Mr. Ling, Zhuoyuan Group wants
to put the cooperation on hold.

332
00:25:15,365 --> 00:25:16,205
Why?

333
00:25:16,685 --> 00:25:19,205
They said it's because of
the negative news we've had lately.

334
00:25:19,685 --> 00:25:22,445
But an insider told me
that there's competition.

335
00:25:22,885 --> 00:25:24,725
They're making a higher offer.

336
00:25:26,645 --> 00:25:28,005
Look into the competing company.

337
00:25:29,445 --> 00:25:31,405
Book me a flight there as well.

338
00:25:31,485 --> 00:25:33,525
-I have to take care of this personally.
-Yes, sir.

339
00:25:47,645 --> 00:25:49,125
How could this be?

340
00:25:49,925 --> 00:25:51,605
I'm pregnant.

341
00:25:52,805 --> 00:25:56,205
But how could I be pregnant?

342
00:25:58,565 --> 00:25:59,765
When did it happen?

343
00:26:02,565 --> 00:26:04,205
Ling Yizhou, thank you.

344
00:26:04,725 --> 00:26:06,005
Did you know that...

345
00:26:07,725 --> 00:26:09,245
there's another way to say thank you?

346
00:26:19,405 --> 00:26:23,125
My period is more than ten days late.
Damn it.

347
00:26:28,805 --> 00:26:32,045
Baby, even though you came
earlier than I expected,

348
00:26:32,925 --> 00:26:36,045
I'll take good care of you.

349
00:26:37,205 --> 00:26:42,925
I'm sure your dad will love you
very much as well.

350
00:27:07,325 --> 00:27:08,885
Hey. Hey!

351
00:27:08,965 --> 00:27:11,005
You're hitting me?
You don't want your money?

352
00:27:12,085 --> 00:27:14,485
I'm sorry. I thought you were a creep.

353
00:27:15,805 --> 00:27:18,245
A creep wouldn't target
someone like you, OK?

354
00:27:18,525 --> 00:27:21,085
Yeah. Look at how I'm dressed.
And you can still recognize me?

355
00:27:21,165 --> 00:27:22,085
You're in love with me.

356
00:27:23,245 --> 00:27:25,525
You're too ugly.
It's hard not to recognize you.

357
00:27:27,885 --> 00:27:29,325
I'm doing this for us, OK?

358
00:27:30,005 --> 00:27:31,805
A single man and woman exchanging cash...

359
00:27:32,325 --> 00:27:34,365
What if someone saw us?
How would we explain it?

360
00:27:37,125 --> 00:27:39,085
Don't touch my hair.

361
00:27:39,525 --> 00:27:40,485
Your hair?

362
00:27:40,565 --> 00:27:43,285
Dressed like this, it's like
you're screaming for people to notice us.

363
00:27:44,445 --> 00:27:49,205
Don't worry. Even though you're famous,
I still like money more.

364
00:27:50,405 --> 00:27:51,965
-Where's the money?
-In the car.

365
00:27:52,325 --> 00:27:53,685
Where do you live? I'll drive you.

366
00:27:54,205 --> 00:27:56,925
No, thanks.
Money is never too heavy for me.

367
00:27:57,005 --> 00:27:58,085
Get over yourself.

368
00:27:58,165 --> 00:27:59,885
Walking around with that much money,

369
00:27:59,965 --> 00:28:01,965
if you get robbed,
I'd be the main suspect.

370
00:28:02,045 --> 00:28:03,965
That would cause me a lot of trouble.

371
00:28:05,925 --> 00:28:06,765
That's true.

372
00:28:08,605 --> 00:28:12,045
Thank you for the ride then, Mr. Chu.

373
00:28:12,125 --> 00:28:14,005
You're welcome, ugly.

374
00:28:24,005 --> 00:28:26,925
You live so far away.
My time is money, you know that?

375
00:28:28,525 --> 00:28:30,605
I'm just an ordinary person.

376
00:28:30,685 --> 00:28:33,285
You think I can afford to live
in the city? It's too expensive.

377
00:28:33,685 --> 00:28:35,405
You know how busy I am.

378
00:28:35,485 --> 00:28:36,365
-My time is--
-Fine.

379
00:28:37,445 --> 00:28:39,605
Just park here. I'll get out.

380
00:28:40,685 --> 00:28:41,725
Bye.

381
00:28:48,325 --> 00:28:49,205
Hey, look.

382
00:28:49,285 --> 00:28:51,405
It's not that I won't drive you.
The road is blocked.

383
00:28:51,845 --> 00:28:53,645
-Back up.
-What?

384
00:28:54,325 --> 00:28:55,325
Back up!

385
00:28:58,685 --> 00:29:00,365
Ordinary people have enemies, too?

386
00:29:00,965 --> 00:29:02,205
They're here to collect debt.

387
00:29:02,605 --> 00:29:04,565
Why else do you think
I'd risk my life to save you?

388
00:29:07,765 --> 00:29:09,405
Are you going to help me or not?

389
00:29:10,245 --> 00:29:11,085
Hold on tight.

390
00:29:29,845 --> 00:29:30,685
Hey.

391
00:29:31,645 --> 00:29:33,005
How much money do you owe them?

392
00:29:33,925 --> 00:29:36,125
I don't need help.
You've already given me a lot of money.

393
00:29:37,805 --> 00:29:39,645
I'm not offering to help.
It's just that...

394
00:29:40,725 --> 00:29:43,365
You should move,
or they'll come for you every day.

395
00:29:44,045 --> 00:29:46,165
I have to move again?

396
00:29:46,965 --> 00:29:49,485
I've lived here the longest.

397
00:29:50,085 --> 00:29:51,245
How long is that?

398
00:29:51,325 --> 00:29:52,525
One month and three days.

399
00:29:52,885 --> 00:29:54,685
You count your days quite meticulously.

400
00:29:54,885 --> 00:29:57,885
Yeah. Every day I get is a blessing.

401
00:29:57,965 --> 00:29:59,325
I feel rich when I think that way.

402
00:30:01,325 --> 00:30:04,325
They say that idiots are often happier.

403
00:30:08,205 --> 00:30:11,245
After what happened today,
I feel kind of bad about this.

404
00:30:12,925 --> 00:30:14,965
No need to save me money.

405
00:30:15,045 --> 00:30:16,405
It gives me peace of mind.

406
00:30:18,005 --> 00:30:19,285
Then I'll happily accept it.

407
00:30:20,445 --> 00:30:21,845
I guess I'm rich now, too.

408
00:30:22,205 --> 00:30:23,605
Come on. I'll treat you to lunch.

409
00:30:24,405 --> 00:30:26,005
No can do. I have things to do.

410
00:30:27,325 --> 00:30:28,845
Alright. Bye then.

411
00:30:47,925 --> 00:30:51,165
About my possible pregnancy...

412
00:30:51,245 --> 00:30:53,285
Don't worry. I won't tell anyone.

413
00:30:53,645 --> 00:30:54,805
Need me at the hospital?

414
00:30:54,885 --> 00:30:57,485
No, it's fine.
It's probably awkward for a man.

415
00:30:57,805 --> 00:30:59,565
I'll go alone when I have time.

416
00:31:01,605 --> 00:31:03,565
Yizhou's birthday is in a few days.

417
00:31:04,325 --> 00:31:07,765
If you tell him the good news as his gift,
I'm sure he'd be very happy.

418
00:31:09,965 --> 00:31:11,845
I hadn't thought about that,

419
00:31:12,085 --> 00:31:15,085
but thanks for remembering his birthday.

420
00:31:16,605 --> 00:31:17,485
Of course I remember.

421
00:31:18,245 --> 00:31:20,765
I'll always remember that day.

422
00:31:24,445 --> 00:31:26,125
Every year, Mom gets sad on that day.

423
00:31:26,725 --> 00:31:28,485
This year, we can finally be together.

424
00:31:28,845 --> 00:31:30,485
You'll have to invite us to celebrate.

425
00:31:31,325 --> 00:31:34,285
Yizhou never celebrated
his birthday in the past,

426
00:31:34,885 --> 00:31:37,205
so I'm afraid I can't promise you that.

427
00:31:38,845 --> 00:31:40,845
That's alright. We'll see what happens.

428
00:31:57,245 --> 00:31:58,525
Did you see the news?

429
00:32:00,365 --> 00:32:01,205
Yes.

430
00:32:02,565 --> 00:32:06,565
It must have been hard
for Mrs. Ling to say that on TV.

431
00:32:06,645 --> 00:32:10,405
Maybe we should invite her
to the house on our birthday.

432
00:32:13,365 --> 00:32:14,205
Whatever you want.

433
00:32:16,045 --> 00:32:17,445
What a good boy.

434
00:32:19,045 --> 00:32:20,085
What are you doing?

435
00:32:20,685 --> 00:32:23,285
What am I doing? Gobbling you up.

436
00:32:23,845 --> 00:32:24,685
You can't.

437
00:32:25,445 --> 00:32:26,285
Why not?

438
00:32:27,685 --> 00:32:29,405
My period is here.

439
00:32:30,765 --> 00:32:33,525
Doesn't your period come
around the 10th every month?

440
00:32:33,965 --> 00:32:35,325
In the past, yes.

441
00:32:35,725 --> 00:32:37,765
But periods are unpredictable.

442
00:32:38,205 --> 00:32:41,725
My hormones might be messed up lately.

443
00:32:48,605 --> 00:32:49,685
Does it hurt?

444
00:32:50,245 --> 00:32:52,125
If it does, I'll take you to the hospital.

445
00:32:53,085 --> 00:32:55,245
It doesn't. Just keep it warm.

446
00:32:55,725 --> 00:32:59,445
<i>Baby, this is Daddy's</i>
<i>first time touching you.</i>

447
00:33:00,245 --> 00:33:03,525
Ling Yizhou, do you want to have children?

448
00:33:06,965 --> 00:33:08,245
I'm almost 30 now.

449
00:33:08,925 --> 00:33:11,485
I have a business, a family, a wife.
All I need is a child now.

450
00:33:11,925 --> 00:33:13,045
What do you think?

451
00:33:13,725 --> 00:33:15,325
Why haven't you asked me about it?

452
00:33:16,005 --> 00:33:17,245
I thought you weren't ready yet.

453
00:33:18,365 --> 00:33:20,005
I have to respect you.

454
00:33:20,085 --> 00:33:23,205
When you're ready, we'll see what happens.

455
00:33:27,285 --> 00:33:30,525
Did I save the whole galaxy
in my previous lifetime?

456
00:33:30,925 --> 00:33:32,205
That's why I get to be with you.

457
00:33:32,805 --> 00:33:35,685
Don't get too close to me.
I'm worried I won't be able to...

458
00:33:41,205 --> 00:33:44,325
Do you want a boy or a girl?

459
00:33:45,165 --> 00:33:46,205
Either will do. You?

460
00:33:47,525 --> 00:33:48,925
It's best to have two.

461
00:33:49,885 --> 00:33:54,845
If it's a girl, I can teach her
good posture and how to cook.

462
00:33:55,165 --> 00:33:57,525
Whatever I do, don't laugh at me.

463
00:33:57,605 --> 00:33:58,925
You have to support me, OK?

464
00:34:00,085 --> 00:34:02,845
If it's a boy, you can teach him stuff.

465
00:34:03,245 --> 00:34:04,445
He has to know how to fight.

466
00:34:04,885 --> 00:34:07,605
Because boys who fight are always popular.

467
00:34:11,765 --> 00:34:14,885
Promise me you'll come home
on your birthday.

468
00:34:16,765 --> 00:34:18,885
I promise I'll be home.

469
00:34:25,445 --> 00:34:26,885
I'll get going now, honey.

470
00:34:27,485 --> 00:34:29,485
Work hard and wait for me to come home.

471
00:34:45,445 --> 00:34:46,565
Enough of that.

472
00:34:46,644 --> 00:34:49,164
It's not like he's
never coming back again. Please.

473
00:34:49,965 --> 00:34:50,965
When did you get here?

474
00:34:52,244 --> 00:34:56,204
Mr. Ling was worried
his precious wife would be sad,

475
00:34:56,285 --> 00:34:57,525
so he had me come over.

476
00:34:58,684 --> 00:35:00,085
He's so sweet.

477
00:35:01,085 --> 00:35:03,245
Not this again. You should be nice
to your single friend.

478
00:35:04,325 --> 00:35:07,405
I'm actually here for a reason today.

479
00:35:07,925 --> 00:35:09,125
They're about to start filming.

480
00:35:09,445 --> 00:35:11,085
I brought your schedule for you.

481
00:35:11,165 --> 00:35:12,885
We'll have to see how prepared you are.

482
00:35:13,725 --> 00:35:15,285
About that...

483
00:35:15,725 --> 00:35:19,365
I have to tell you something.

484
00:35:19,925 --> 00:35:22,365
What? Are you backing out of it?

485
00:35:26,405 --> 00:35:27,245
Shh!

486
00:35:28,485 --> 00:35:31,365
If Ms. Huang finds out,
she'll tell Yizhou.

487
00:35:31,645 --> 00:35:33,485
I want to give him a birthday surprise.

488
00:35:35,765 --> 00:35:36,765
I'm going to be an aunt?

489
00:35:38,325 --> 00:35:39,525
Congratulations.

490
00:35:40,525 --> 00:35:42,565
Congratulations.
Have you been to the hospital yet?

491
00:35:43,365 --> 00:35:45,645
-Not yet.
-Why not?

492
00:35:45,725 --> 00:35:47,765
You have to do a full check-up.

493
00:35:48,485 --> 00:35:49,965
It's not that big of a deal.

494
00:35:50,205 --> 00:35:51,565
Of course it is.

495
00:35:51,645 --> 00:35:53,325
Being pregnant is a big life event.

496
00:35:53,405 --> 00:35:55,445
If your husband died,
it wouldn't be as important.

497
00:35:55,765 --> 00:35:57,885
I shouldn't have said that.

498
00:35:57,965 --> 00:35:59,845
Damn it. I didn't mean that.

499
00:36:00,245 --> 00:36:01,805
Anyways, it's very important.

500
00:36:01,885 --> 00:36:03,445
Come on. Let's go to the hospital.

501
00:36:03,645 --> 00:36:06,285
-You can't put it off any longer.
-Come on.

502
00:36:06,885 --> 00:36:09,445
GANGDONG INTERNATIONAL MEDICAL CENTER

503
00:36:13,445 --> 00:36:15,005
TYPE B ULTRASOUND PREGNANCY SCAN

504
00:36:17,645 --> 00:36:18,485
OK, thank you.

505
00:36:23,525 --> 00:36:25,245
OK, we're done.

506
00:36:25,725 --> 00:36:27,885
The doctor said both you
and the baby are healthy.

507
00:36:27,965 --> 00:36:30,805
Now, you'll have to wait for nine months.

508
00:36:32,685 --> 00:36:33,925
Fei...

509
00:36:36,885 --> 00:36:39,285
What? Why are you crying?

510
00:36:40,005 --> 00:36:40,965
I don't know.

511
00:36:42,045 --> 00:36:46,685
I'm so touched that I'm going to be a mom.

512
00:36:48,165 --> 00:36:51,845
I'm also quite touched
that I'm going to be an auntie.

513
00:36:54,005 --> 00:36:54,925
The doctor did say

514
00:36:55,285 --> 00:36:57,525
that pregnant women
are especially emotional.

515
00:36:58,085 --> 00:37:01,045
But a baby can feel
the emotions of its mother.

516
00:37:01,245 --> 00:37:04,165
For your baby, you have to keep
your emotions in check, OK?

517
00:37:04,365 --> 00:37:05,205
OK.

518
00:37:13,445 --> 00:37:14,285
Hello?

519
00:37:14,765 --> 00:37:17,805
<i>Hello? Mumu, are you sick? Is it serious?</i>

520
00:37:20,285 --> 00:37:25,365
I'm fine. Jia Fei wasn't feeling well.

521
00:37:25,445 --> 00:37:26,805
I came to the hospital with her.

522
00:37:26,885 --> 00:37:28,405
<i>-You scared me.</i>
-Yeah.

523
00:37:28,485 --> 00:37:31,965
Don't worry. Focus on work. Love you.

524
00:37:34,645 --> 00:37:37,885
You're so bad at lying. It's so obvious.

525
00:37:38,325 --> 00:37:40,005
Only Mr. Ling would believe you.

526
00:37:45,165 --> 00:37:46,005
Hello?

527
00:37:46,485 --> 00:37:48,285
<i>Hello? Fei, you're sick?</i>

528
00:37:51,485 --> 00:37:52,525
<i>Is it serious?</i>

529
00:37:52,605 --> 00:37:54,965
It's a private matter.

530
00:37:55,685 --> 00:37:57,005
I can't really tell you.

531
00:37:57,365 --> 00:37:59,125
<i>Is it because of your period?</i>
<i>Like last time?</i>

532
00:38:01,485 --> 00:38:03,285
The doctor's here.

533
00:38:03,365 --> 00:38:04,645
I have to go. Bye.

534
00:38:05,805 --> 00:38:07,685
Did I miss out on something?

535
00:38:07,765 --> 00:38:08,685
This is all your fault.

536
00:39:19,725 --> 00:39:22,205
Oh, my God. My gosh!

537
00:39:22,285 --> 00:39:23,605
Get down right now.

538
00:39:24,005 --> 00:39:24,845
-What?
-Get down.

539
00:39:25,445 --> 00:39:27,645
You managed to stay safe while filming.

540
00:39:27,725 --> 00:39:29,365
You'd better not fall at home.

541
00:39:29,565 --> 00:39:30,405
Come sit here.

542
00:39:31,605 --> 00:39:32,445
Here.

543
00:39:33,565 --> 00:39:36,365
I've been so worried about you
that I've started to grow gray hairs.

544
00:39:38,085 --> 00:39:39,685
Just sit here and relax.

545
00:39:39,765 --> 00:39:41,125
Wait for the driver to come

546
00:39:41,205 --> 00:39:43,645
and take you to see your Mr. Ling, OK?

547
00:39:43,725 --> 00:39:46,765
Just let me know what needs to be done.

548
00:39:47,965 --> 00:39:49,445
Good girl.

549
00:40:03,605 --> 00:40:04,645
Hello, Mr. Liu?

550
00:40:06,325 --> 00:40:08,005
What? You're sick?

551
00:40:10,325 --> 00:40:12,885
Don't worry. Get some rest then.

552
00:40:13,125 --> 00:40:14,565
I can go to the airport myself.

553
00:40:19,405 --> 00:40:21,845
Ms. Huang, Feifei,
I'm heading to the airport.

554
00:40:21,925 --> 00:40:23,085
Carry on! Good luck!

555
00:40:23,325 --> 00:40:25,885
OK. Have the driver be careful.

556
00:40:27,125 --> 00:40:28,845
Mrs. Ling, you're here. Come inside.

557
00:40:28,925 --> 00:40:30,685
I'm going to the airport
to pick up Yizhou.

558
00:40:31,925 --> 00:40:33,525
You're so eager to see him, huh?

559
00:40:33,965 --> 00:40:36,245
Go in now. See you soon, Mrs. Ling.

560
00:40:45,245 --> 00:40:46,245
Mumu.

561
00:40:47,485 --> 00:40:48,485
Mumu?

562
00:40:48,565 --> 00:40:49,405
Ms. Huang?

563
00:40:52,085 --> 00:40:53,285
Surprise!

564
00:40:54,525 --> 00:40:56,005
Happy birthday!

565
00:40:56,525 --> 00:40:58,245
-Are you happy?
-We've been waiting for you.

566
00:41:01,285 --> 00:41:03,645
-Where's Mumu?
-Didn't she meet you at the airport?

567
00:41:04,125 --> 00:41:06,165
-Why didn't she come back with you?
-Yeah.

568
00:41:07,765 --> 00:41:08,925
She went to the airport?

569
00:42:05,005 --> 00:42:06,885
Is anyone there? Help!

570
00:42:07,565 --> 00:42:08,685
Is anyone out there?

571
00:42:14,045 --> 00:42:16,645
Can you hear me? Is anyone there?

572
00:42:17,525 --> 00:42:18,645
Is anyone out there?

573
00:42:37,925 --> 00:42:40,645
Mumu, I'm at the branch office now.

574
00:42:41,125 --> 00:42:42,325
The meeting will start soon.

575
00:42:43,645 --> 00:42:46,045
Are you sick? Is it serious?

576
00:42:49,525 --> 00:42:50,365
You scared me.

577
00:42:50,765 --> 00:42:52,725
OK. Bye.

578
00:42:56,045 --> 00:42:58,125
False alarm. My wife isn't sick.

579
00:42:58,205 --> 00:43:00,605
It's her friend. Off to the meeting.

580
00:43:07,725 --> 00:43:09,085
Hello? Fei, you're sick?

581
00:43:09,165 --> 00:43:10,125
Is it serious?

582
00:43:10,205 --> 00:43:12,125
Is it because of your period?
Like last time?

583
00:43:12,205 --> 00:43:13,805
<i>I'm fine. Don't worry.</i>

584
00:43:13,885 --> 00:43:15,165
OK, going to the meeting now.

585
00:44:49,365 --> 00:44:51,125
Subtitle translation by Sophie Chang

586
00:44:51,685 --> 00:44:55,245
Your beloved wife has disappeared
and you're out with another woman?

587
00:44:56,245 --> 00:44:59,325
Ling Yizhou, you're too big a loser
to be my friend.

588
00:45:00,085 --> 00:45:02,925
I'm telling you,
if you don't take care of Xia Lin,

589
00:45:03,485 --> 00:45:05,125
I, Chu Yan, will still protect her.

590
00:45:05,485 --> 00:45:07,405
What are you going to threaten him with?

591
00:45:07,805 --> 00:45:10,125
I just want to see him lose
the woman he loves

592
00:45:10,605 --> 00:45:12,525
and never be happy.

593
00:45:12,605 --> 00:45:13,885
I've never done anything to him.

594
00:45:14,365 --> 00:45:16,565
I can't figure out why he did this.

595
00:45:17,565 --> 00:45:20,565
The only possible reason
is because of you.
