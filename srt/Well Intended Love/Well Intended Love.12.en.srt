1
00:00:12,885 --> 00:00:15,765
Mr. Ling just wants you
to get some rest at home.

2
00:00:15,845 --> 00:00:18,205
Ling Yizhou, you love being in control.

3
00:00:18,285 --> 00:00:19,885
Even in love, you try to set people up.

4
00:00:20,245 --> 00:00:21,685
I was just trying to protect you.

5
00:00:21,765 --> 00:00:23,165
I'm not your pet.

6
00:00:23,245 --> 00:00:24,925
I can survive
without you taking care of me.

7
00:00:26,085 --> 00:00:27,685
I won't let you go.

8
00:00:27,965 --> 00:00:29,525
I never thought about getting a divorce.

9
00:00:29,605 --> 00:00:31,845
I just wanted some time
to think about our relationship.

10
00:00:32,085 --> 00:00:34,165
You've never treated me
as an independent individual.

11
00:00:34,725 --> 00:00:37,685
I never thought you would lock me up.

12
00:00:37,764 --> 00:00:40,365
You just want to satisfy your sense
of possession and manipulation.

13
00:00:40,725 --> 00:00:44,405
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

14
00:02:11,365 --> 00:02:14,325
EPISODE 12

15
00:02:18,725 --> 00:02:19,565
Morning.

16
00:02:19,965 --> 00:02:21,005
What are you wearing?

17
00:02:22,005 --> 00:02:23,245
What? Am I too handsome?

18
00:02:24,245 --> 00:02:28,165
His Majesty didn't drag me here
just to look at his pretty face, did he?

19
00:02:29,725 --> 00:02:30,925
What's the job here?

20
00:02:31,485 --> 00:02:32,325
Biking.

21
00:02:33,205 --> 00:02:34,045
What?

22
00:02:34,805 --> 00:02:38,485
Come bike with me. You'll get paid
handsomely at the end of the day.

23
00:02:38,565 --> 00:02:39,925
You're messing with me, aren't you?

24
00:02:41,805 --> 00:02:44,285
Stop leaving before the conversation ends.

25
00:02:44,365 --> 00:02:45,325
Let me finish speaking!

26
00:02:46,925 --> 00:02:47,765
Fine.

27
00:02:48,925 --> 00:02:52,085
It's a thing online now
to sell your time, right?

28
00:02:52,165 --> 00:02:54,285
Have a meal with someone,
chat with them, whatever.

29
00:02:54,565 --> 00:02:56,605
I haven't brought you here
to do something that bad.

30
00:02:57,045 --> 00:02:59,405
Are you that reluctant
to exercise with me?

31
00:02:59,805 --> 00:03:03,005
Find someone else.
I'm busy and not in the mood.

32
00:03:03,365 --> 00:03:05,525
Not in the mood? That's perfect then.

33
00:03:06,045 --> 00:03:08,685
If you hole yourself up at home all day,
you'll make yourself sick.

34
00:03:10,965 --> 00:03:12,565
Fine. How about this?

35
00:03:14,565 --> 00:03:16,805
For every mile you ride with me,
I'll pay you 100RMB.

36
00:03:20,765 --> 00:03:23,445
You're smart. 200RMB per mile, then.

37
00:03:25,845 --> 00:03:28,045
Can you stop being so stubborn?

38
00:03:28,405 --> 00:03:30,885
I'm a superstar who came out here
just to exercise with you.

39
00:03:36,205 --> 00:03:37,685
I'll bike you into bankruptcy.

40
00:03:38,445 --> 00:03:39,565
Don't regret this.

41
00:04:18,405 --> 00:04:19,365
Yizhou.

42
00:04:21,125 --> 00:04:23,005
-You're awake.
-What are you doing here, Grandma?

43
00:04:23,485 --> 00:04:26,445
What am I doing here? If I hadn't come,

44
00:04:27,525 --> 00:04:29,885
you'd keep hurting yourself, wouldn't you?

45
00:04:30,565 --> 00:04:33,125
Drinking with a fever
over 104 degrees Fahrenheit?

46
00:04:33,205 --> 00:04:34,445
Are you trying to kill yourself?

47
00:04:34,525 --> 00:04:37,565
It's just a cold, Grandma,
I'll be fine with some rest.

48
00:04:39,085 --> 00:04:40,925
Fine with some rest?

49
00:04:41,125 --> 00:04:44,765
Last time, I didn't interfere
in your marriage because

50
00:04:45,085 --> 00:04:48,005
I was hoping you two would
get over it yourselves.

51
00:04:48,085 --> 00:04:49,005
What happened then?

52
00:04:49,085 --> 00:04:54,085
Grandma, Xia Lin is just
a bit mad with me.

53
00:04:54,725 --> 00:04:56,165
You're lying to me.

54
00:04:56,525 --> 00:04:58,165
If it were just a little bit,

55
00:04:58,565 --> 00:05:00,885
why would you do this to yourself?

56
00:05:02,925 --> 00:05:06,725
Tell me, what's going on with you two?

57
00:05:10,565 --> 00:05:11,685
You're not going to tell me?

58
00:05:12,085 --> 00:05:14,005
Fine. I'll go ask her.

59
00:05:21,965 --> 00:05:23,085
Yizhou.

60
00:05:25,005 --> 00:05:26,685
Tell your grandma the truth.

61
00:05:28,365 --> 00:05:29,845
Do you still love her?

62
00:05:30,565 --> 00:05:31,445
I do.

63
00:05:32,685 --> 00:05:35,925
I used to think love was owning
the person, ignoring everyone else.

64
00:05:36,925 --> 00:05:40,165
I thought she'd only have eyes for me.

65
00:05:42,725 --> 00:05:44,285
Was I wrong, Grandma?

66
00:05:46,125 --> 00:05:50,885
It's not wrong,
but the scope of your love is too narrow.

67
00:05:52,925 --> 00:05:54,645
Love is indeed selfish,

68
00:05:55,365 --> 00:05:59,565
but it is also about accepting,
equality, and respect.

69
00:06:00,485 --> 00:06:04,165
So to get Xia Lin back,
I'll have to compromise, right?

70
00:06:07,005 --> 00:06:08,765
Not necessarily.

71
00:06:10,405 --> 00:06:12,125
A good marriage

72
00:06:12,805 --> 00:06:15,125
takes effort to protect.

73
00:06:16,605 --> 00:06:18,725
It should make you better.

74
00:06:22,325 --> 00:06:23,365
Yizhou.

75
00:06:24,485 --> 00:06:28,725
Family is all about love, not logic.

76
00:06:29,965 --> 00:06:31,485
Look into your heart

77
00:06:32,205 --> 00:06:34,165
and you'll know what to do.

78
00:08:07,045 --> 00:08:09,485
Exercise is relaxing, right?

79
00:08:10,165 --> 00:08:11,125
Thank you.

80
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:15,005
I know you did this to cheer me up.

81
00:08:15,285 --> 00:08:16,565
Why so serious suddenly?

82
00:08:16,925 --> 00:08:17,805
It's not like you.

83
00:08:18,365 --> 00:08:19,565
Thankful as I am...

84
00:08:20,805 --> 00:08:21,965
you still need to pay me.

85
00:08:23,605 --> 00:08:24,725
I know.

86
00:08:26,965 --> 00:08:28,405
What are you doing now?

87
00:08:28,485 --> 00:08:29,805
I'm a little stressed too, OK?

88
00:08:30,165 --> 00:08:32,205
I need to relax.
Don't you know how far you biked?

89
00:08:36,725 --> 00:08:38,445
What? Why are you staring at me?

90
00:08:39,405 --> 00:08:40,245
I know.

91
00:08:40,605 --> 00:08:45,485
Am I glowing to you right now?
I'm absolutely perfect.

92
00:08:46,445 --> 00:08:49,725
Maybe if you weren't so self-absorbed,

93
00:08:50,485 --> 00:08:52,165
someone would have fallen for you by now.

94
00:08:52,245 --> 00:08:54,765
Stop, I don't need any advice.

95
00:08:55,165 --> 00:08:56,845
I'm very happy with myself.

96
00:09:17,165 --> 00:09:18,245
Thank you.

97
00:09:18,725 --> 00:09:21,685
No need to be polite.
Just make me instant noodles next time.

98
00:09:22,805 --> 00:09:24,245
-I'll get going. Bye.
-Bye.

99
00:09:29,325 --> 00:09:30,405
-Bye.
-See you.

100
00:09:37,205 --> 00:09:38,045
Mumu.

101
00:09:40,205 --> 00:09:43,245
I don't have ten million yet,
but I'm working on it.

102
00:09:43,965 --> 00:09:44,805
Mumu.

103
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:47,085
I'm sorry.

104
00:09:53,925 --> 00:09:57,405
This is the first time
you've apologized to me.

105
00:10:01,365 --> 00:10:02,725
You once told me that

106
00:10:03,605 --> 00:10:07,245
honesty and respect are the most
important things in a relationship.

107
00:10:08,845 --> 00:10:09,885
I failed doing that.

108
00:10:12,205 --> 00:10:15,885
Maybe in the future,
I won't succeed completely...

109
00:10:17,485 --> 00:10:18,925
but I'm willing to try hard.

110
00:10:21,885 --> 00:10:22,725
Don't worry.

111
00:10:23,965 --> 00:10:26,525
Things are over between us.
You should leave.

112
00:10:26,845 --> 00:10:27,685
Mumu.

113
00:10:33,645 --> 00:10:35,605
If you're sick, you should stay at home.

114
00:10:37,805 --> 00:10:39,365
I'm not hoping for your forgiveness.

115
00:10:41,885 --> 00:10:42,725
But...

116
00:10:43,965 --> 00:10:45,445
I'll try my best to change.

117
00:10:47,445 --> 00:10:51,165
Even if you don't believe me now,
I'll prove it to you.

118
00:11:03,165 --> 00:11:06,325
Take care of yourself then.

119
00:11:09,125 --> 00:11:11,365
I'll get going now.

120
00:11:39,965 --> 00:11:41,605
<i>I'm not hoping for your forgiveness.</i>

121
00:11:44,005 --> 00:11:47,205
<i>But... I'll try my best to change.</i>

122
00:11:49,445 --> 00:11:50,925
<i>Even if you don't believe me now,</i>

123
00:11:51,845 --> 00:11:53,165
<i>I'll prove it to you.</i>

124
00:12:10,165 --> 00:12:12,325
<i>Mumu, don't forget to eat breakfast.</i>

125
00:12:28,245 --> 00:12:30,405
Even though I'm mad,
I shouldn't waste food.

126
00:12:30,845 --> 00:12:31,965
Might as well eat it.

127
00:12:35,405 --> 00:12:37,085
<i>Just wear this and hand out flyers.</i>

128
00:12:37,405 --> 00:12:40,605
<i>But it's so hot. I'll have a heatstroke.</i>

129
00:12:41,285 --> 00:12:44,445
<i>You don't have to wear it,</i>
<i>but the pay is 100RMB more if you do.</i>

130
00:12:45,805 --> 00:12:47,605
<i>Alright, I'll wear it.</i>

131
00:12:56,165 --> 00:12:57,525
<i>Wow. I even have a friend mascot.</i>

132
00:13:29,125 --> 00:13:29,965
Mumu.

133
00:13:32,685 --> 00:13:33,845
What do you want?

134
00:13:34,685 --> 00:13:36,165
Wherever you go, I go.

135
00:13:38,125 --> 00:13:40,285
I don't have time to deal with you.
Do whatever you want.

136
00:13:50,085 --> 00:13:50,925
Have a seat.

137
00:14:03,245 --> 00:14:05,645
Five kebabs and two chicken wings!

138
00:14:05,725 --> 00:14:07,605
-Alrighty!
-I'll have the same as her.

139
00:14:07,685 --> 00:14:08,525
OK.

140
00:14:09,765 --> 00:14:10,805
A special lamb kebab, too.

141
00:14:11,405 --> 00:14:12,965
-Got it.
-I'll have one, too.

142
00:14:40,325 --> 00:14:42,125
I'm driving. I can't drink.

143
00:15:25,765 --> 00:15:27,685
Sir, this lamb kidney isn't spicy enough!

144
00:15:58,805 --> 00:16:00,645
You shouldn't have ordered so much.

145
00:16:01,005 --> 00:16:02,005
Food-waster.

146
00:16:02,885 --> 00:16:04,285
Sir, I'm paying.

147
00:16:10,325 --> 00:16:11,565
Did you not like the food, sir?

148
00:16:12,485 --> 00:16:14,285
I'll take it to go.

149
00:16:29,285 --> 00:16:30,885
-Mumu--
-I'm home. You can leave now.

150
00:16:40,285 --> 00:16:41,125
Good night.

151
00:17:30,525 --> 00:17:33,445
<i>Xia Lin, don't embarrass yourself.</i>

152
00:17:34,045 --> 00:17:35,245
<i>Hold it together.</i>

153
00:18:21,685 --> 00:18:24,445
Hello, I'm here for the interview.

154
00:18:25,285 --> 00:18:27,605
Miss Xia. Please have a seat.

155
00:18:31,805 --> 00:18:33,045
I actually asked you here

156
00:18:33,125 --> 00:18:35,205
because I am familiar
with your previous work.

157
00:18:35,485 --> 00:18:38,205
I think your image would be suitable
for our company's next ad.

158
00:18:39,085 --> 00:18:41,045
What kind of company is it?

159
00:18:41,845 --> 00:18:42,685
Concentrated juice.

160
00:18:44,645 --> 00:18:45,725
You can try it.

161
00:18:53,885 --> 00:18:58,045
It tastes like lemon,
pineapple, and orange.

162
00:18:58,125 --> 00:18:59,405
It's quite flavorful.

163
00:19:00,365 --> 00:19:01,205
Perfect.

164
00:19:03,405 --> 00:19:04,645
To be frank, Miss Xia,

165
00:19:04,885 --> 00:19:06,885
I've interviewed
quite a few people before you,

166
00:19:07,365 --> 00:19:09,045
but none of them were as perfect as you.

167
00:19:09,405 --> 00:19:12,205
Would you be interested
in this job opportunity?

168
00:19:12,765 --> 00:19:14,205
Yes, of course!

169
00:19:15,005 --> 00:19:17,605
Excellent, I'll go call the director.

170
00:19:19,165 --> 00:19:21,685
Here are some details. Have a look.

171
00:19:21,765 --> 00:19:22,725
OK.

172
00:20:28,725 --> 00:20:30,685
Xia Lin...

173
00:20:31,365 --> 00:20:32,205
Xia Lin!

174
00:20:36,445 --> 00:20:37,285
Xia Lin!

175
00:20:38,005 --> 00:20:39,125
You came...

176
00:20:39,885 --> 00:20:43,325
I... I think I'm drunk.

177
00:20:44,965 --> 00:20:45,845
What are you doing?

178
00:20:46,845 --> 00:20:50,325
Ling Yizhou, why are you here?

179
00:20:52,285 --> 00:20:54,525
What are you saying?
I'm Chu Yan, not Ling Yizhou!

180
00:20:58,445 --> 00:20:59,845
-Button up.
-What about Chu Yan?

181
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:03,805
You don't like Chu Yan, you like me!

182
00:21:03,885 --> 00:21:05,045
What are you talking about?

183
00:21:05,125 --> 00:21:06,165
I...

184
00:21:08,845 --> 00:21:12,125
Tell me, do you like me or not?

185
00:21:15,565 --> 00:21:17,445
-I...
-Tell me!

186
00:21:17,765 --> 00:21:18,605
I like you.

187
00:21:19,565 --> 00:21:22,445
Then... give me a kiss.

188
00:21:23,125 --> 00:21:24,805
Give me a kiss!

189
00:21:43,245 --> 00:21:45,565
Kiss me, Ling Yizhou!

190
00:21:47,605 --> 00:21:50,285
Ling Yizhou, kiss me!

191
00:21:56,965 --> 00:21:59,645
Stop it! Button yourself up!

192
00:22:04,805 --> 00:22:06,765
Ling, you're finally here.

193
00:22:07,285 --> 00:22:09,845
Your wife is killing me. Hurry up.

194
00:22:09,925 --> 00:22:11,365
Don't go...

195
00:22:16,685 --> 00:22:19,085
Why are there two of you, Yizhou?

196
00:22:20,325 --> 00:22:21,205
Mumu...

197
00:22:21,925 --> 00:22:22,885
Mumu...

198
00:22:25,205 --> 00:22:26,205
Mumu...

199
00:22:26,525 --> 00:22:27,485
Mumu...

200
00:22:27,885 --> 00:22:28,725
Mumu...

201
00:22:29,005 --> 00:22:32,405
I just received a message
saying Xia Lin was in danger.

202
00:22:32,485 --> 00:22:34,565
I found her like this when I got here.

203
00:22:34,645 --> 00:22:36,605
Someone was trying to frame me.

204
00:22:39,765 --> 00:22:40,605
Chu Yan.

205
00:22:41,765 --> 00:22:42,925
Thank you for telling me.

206
00:22:44,165 --> 00:22:45,005
No problem.

207
00:22:45,365 --> 00:22:47,645
Just stop causing me trouble, you two.

208
00:22:49,765 --> 00:22:50,605
I'll get going.

209
00:22:53,245 --> 00:22:54,085
Mumu.

210
00:22:55,165 --> 00:22:56,125
Mumu, wake up.

211
00:22:57,165 --> 00:22:58,005
Mumu.

212
00:23:02,405 --> 00:23:04,365
Wake up, Mumu.

213
00:23:11,885 --> 00:23:13,845
It seems like Chu Yan
has also fallen for Xia Lin.

214
00:23:14,405 --> 00:23:15,765
I don't get it.

215
00:23:16,125 --> 00:23:19,965
What allure does this girl have
to bring two men to their knees?

216
00:23:24,725 --> 00:23:26,085
What are we going to do then?

217
00:23:30,165 --> 00:23:31,285
I actually have an idea.

218
00:23:33,525 --> 00:23:35,485
But you have to make some tough choices.

219
00:23:40,685 --> 00:23:42,605
As long as it destroys
Xia Lin's reputation...

220
00:23:43,845 --> 00:23:45,365
I'll do whatever it takes.

221
00:23:57,245 --> 00:23:59,165
Mumu, I'll go get fresh clothes for you.

222
00:23:59,245 --> 00:24:02,485
Don't go. Stay with me.

223
00:24:02,845 --> 00:24:04,245
When I wake up...

224
00:24:06,005 --> 00:24:09,205
I won't be able to talk to you.

225
00:24:09,805 --> 00:24:10,805
I'm sorry, Mumu.

226
00:24:12,125 --> 00:24:15,245
Ling Yizhou, you're such a jerk.

227
00:24:16,045 --> 00:24:17,965
Yes... I'm a jerk.

228
00:24:18,045 --> 00:24:20,445
After all this happened...

229
00:24:20,965 --> 00:24:23,645
why do I still love you?

230
00:24:25,845 --> 00:24:28,645
I'm sorry, Mumu.
I'll never hurt you again.

231
00:24:29,845 --> 00:24:30,845
Really?

232
00:24:31,805 --> 00:24:32,685
I swear.

233
00:24:34,565 --> 00:24:35,845
I'll always respect you.

234
00:24:38,085 --> 00:24:39,165
I won't lie to you.

235
00:24:40,205 --> 00:24:41,805
Whatever you do, I'll support you.

236
00:24:43,925 --> 00:24:47,205
Just believe me one last time. OK?

237
00:25:36,525 --> 00:25:39,965
Tell me, do you like me or not?

238
00:25:42,645 --> 00:25:44,525
Tell me!

239
00:25:45,285 --> 00:25:46,445
I like you.

240
00:25:46,525 --> 00:25:51,805
Then... give me a kiss! Kiss me.

241
00:25:57,605 --> 00:26:01,125
<i>I like you, but I can't like you.</i>

242
00:26:21,605 --> 00:26:22,605
Ling Yizhou!

243
00:26:26,685 --> 00:26:27,525
Morning, Mumu.

244
00:26:27,885 --> 00:26:28,725
Stay there!

245
00:26:31,885 --> 00:26:35,005
What? You're dumping me
after a one-night stand?

246
00:26:35,085 --> 00:26:37,085
I was drunk last night,
I don't remember anything.

247
00:26:37,885 --> 00:26:39,165
So you won't take responsibility?

248
00:26:39,965 --> 00:26:41,525
You took advantage of me, Ling Yizhou!

249
00:26:42,045 --> 00:26:43,045
Am I that kind of person?

250
00:26:44,045 --> 00:26:46,325
The proof is right in front of you.

251
00:26:50,165 --> 00:26:51,085
I didn't touch you.

252
00:26:52,805 --> 00:26:53,925
But you just said...

253
00:26:54,845 --> 00:26:55,765
I was joking around.

254
00:27:02,005 --> 00:27:03,085
Where are my clothes?

255
00:27:03,485 --> 00:27:05,605
I had Ms. Huang wash them.
You'll get them back soon.

256
00:27:10,845 --> 00:27:13,685
Xia Lin, I know you haven't forgiven me,

257
00:27:13,965 --> 00:27:15,125
but I'm going to try my best.

258
00:27:19,405 --> 00:27:21,045
Do you remember anything from yesterday?

259
00:27:22,325 --> 00:27:23,845
I went to an interview.

260
00:27:24,285 --> 00:27:26,925
I drank some juice and then passed out.

261
00:27:27,205 --> 00:27:29,085
I don't know what happened after that.

262
00:27:29,365 --> 00:27:30,965
Was there something wrong with the juice?

263
00:27:31,445 --> 00:27:32,605
That was no juice.

264
00:27:33,365 --> 00:27:36,005
It tasted similar,
but it was actually high-proof liquor.

265
00:27:36,525 --> 00:27:38,325
It gets people drunk unknowingly.

266
00:27:39,525 --> 00:27:41,085
Someone was trying to harm me?

267
00:27:43,525 --> 00:27:44,965
I'll find out as soon as possible.

268
00:27:47,765 --> 00:27:49,965
How did you know I was there?
Were you spying on me?

269
00:27:50,245 --> 00:27:52,245
I plan on keeping my promises.

270
00:27:52,805 --> 00:27:54,005
Chu Yan told me about it.

271
00:27:55,205 --> 00:27:56,125
Chu Yan?

272
00:27:57,885 --> 00:27:59,205
Why would he be there?

273
00:27:59,925 --> 00:28:01,645
Someone sent him an anonymous message.

274
00:28:05,165 --> 00:28:06,125
I'm sorry.

275
00:28:07,125 --> 00:28:09,125
I shouldn't have jumped to conclusions.

276
00:28:12,085 --> 00:28:13,645
I messed up too many times before.

277
00:28:15,205 --> 00:28:16,365
Let's sleep in for a bit.

278
00:28:18,165 --> 00:28:19,165
I need to freshen up.

279
00:28:47,845 --> 00:28:49,205
What are you doing here?

280
00:28:49,605 --> 00:28:50,885
I'm here to report to Mr. Ling.

281
00:28:50,965 --> 00:28:53,645
Mr. Wen, I heard something happened
to Xia Lin yesterday.

282
00:28:53,725 --> 00:28:54,805
We're here to see her.

283
00:28:58,645 --> 00:29:00,085
You haven't been home in days.

284
00:29:00,365 --> 00:29:02,685
I called you, didn't I?

285
00:29:03,045 --> 00:29:04,525
I've been rushing a script at work.

286
00:29:05,245 --> 00:29:06,165
Are you avoiding me?

287
00:29:07,845 --> 00:29:09,365
Why would I do that?

288
00:29:09,445 --> 00:29:12,405
I don't owe you money.
Why would I avoid you? Step aside.

289
00:29:12,485 --> 00:29:13,365
Xia Lin.

290
00:29:17,525 --> 00:29:19,125
Linlin, are you alright?

291
00:29:19,845 --> 00:29:21,125
We'll talk later.

292
00:29:22,645 --> 00:29:23,565
I'll get you a driver.

293
00:29:24,445 --> 00:29:26,525
No, we'll get a cab.

294
00:29:37,365 --> 00:29:38,525
How's the investigation going?

295
00:29:39,125 --> 00:29:41,125
The cameras at the bar were destroyed.

296
00:29:41,205 --> 00:29:42,925
The message Chu Yan
received was anonymous.

297
00:29:43,005 --> 00:29:45,045
It was sent from a proxy server,
so we can't trace it.

298
00:29:45,405 --> 00:29:47,245
They came prepared.

299
00:29:50,805 --> 00:29:51,845
Someone sent me this.

300
00:29:53,125 --> 00:29:54,925
They installed a camera in the suite.

301
00:29:55,645 --> 00:29:56,845
Does Mrs. Ling know?

302
00:29:57,645 --> 00:29:59,565
No. There's no need to tell her.

303
00:30:01,245 --> 00:30:03,005
How's the investigation
into the Chu family?

304
00:30:03,325 --> 00:30:04,805
Everything is pretty much in place.

305
00:30:05,805 --> 00:30:06,845
Set things in action then.

306
00:30:06,925 --> 00:30:07,885
Yes, sir.

307
00:30:13,565 --> 00:30:15,125
Got it.

308
00:30:20,005 --> 00:30:21,725
-Xia Lin.
-What did they say?

309
00:30:21,805 --> 00:30:24,205
They said Chu Yan didn't show up
at the office today.

310
00:30:25,245 --> 00:30:27,845
He's not answering his phone,
not going to work...

311
00:30:27,925 --> 00:30:29,245
Did he just disappear?

312
00:30:29,525 --> 00:30:30,805
Why are you looking for him?

313
00:30:31,765 --> 00:30:34,285
He was the first one
to find me last night.

314
00:30:34,605 --> 00:30:36,245
I'm worried that...

315
00:30:36,845 --> 00:30:38,085
Yes, you should find him.

316
00:30:38,165 --> 00:30:41,005
Who knows what kind of misunderstandings
you might have caused.

317
00:30:41,845 --> 00:30:44,925
Other people might misunderstand.
Chu Yan wouldn't.

318
00:30:45,005 --> 00:30:46,205
We're buddies.

319
00:30:47,085 --> 00:30:48,805
You never know with these things.

320
00:30:48,885 --> 00:30:50,325
It's best to be clear about it.

321
00:30:56,925 --> 00:30:57,765
<i>What's up?</i>

322
00:30:58,405 --> 00:31:01,165
Finally! Where are you?

323
00:31:01,605 --> 00:31:03,965
I'm at the pier that we rode our bikes to.

324
00:31:04,565 --> 00:31:05,565
What are you doing there?

325
00:31:06,125 --> 00:31:06,965
Pondering life.

326
00:31:08,605 --> 00:31:13,485
I don't want to see news of your death
in the papers tomorrow.

327
00:31:13,565 --> 00:31:15,525
With me being
the last person you talked to,

328
00:31:15,605 --> 00:31:17,565
I'd never get the stain off my reputation.

329
00:31:17,845 --> 00:31:20,525
Don't worry, before I jump,

330
00:31:20,605 --> 00:31:22,405
I'll be sure to delete my phone records.

331
00:31:41,805 --> 00:31:44,885
Feifei, don't worry.
Go meet that investor.

332
00:31:45,245 --> 00:31:46,485
We're already here.

333
00:31:46,885 --> 00:31:49,165
Alright, I'll talk to you when I get home.

334
00:31:51,565 --> 00:31:52,885
Tongtong, wait for me here.

335
00:31:52,965 --> 00:31:54,845
I'll just have a quick look. Ten minutes.

336
00:31:55,245 --> 00:31:57,525
Alright, just be careful.

337
00:31:57,605 --> 00:31:58,525
I will.

338
00:32:15,885 --> 00:32:16,925
Chu Yan, don't...

339
00:32:19,485 --> 00:32:20,965
Thank God I stopped you.

340
00:32:21,045 --> 00:32:22,325
What are you so upset about?

341
00:32:25,445 --> 00:32:27,085
What are you laughing at? Are you crazy?

342
00:32:28,405 --> 00:32:31,605
I was thinking how if I died today,

343
00:32:32,165 --> 00:32:34,205
it would be because you pushed me.

344
00:32:34,285 --> 00:32:36,965
Pushed you? You were about to fall in.

345
00:32:37,045 --> 00:32:38,885
If I hadn't grabbed you,
you'd have fallen in.

346
00:32:40,365 --> 00:32:42,685
You're sick. Are you trying
to make it worse out here?

347
00:32:43,285 --> 00:32:44,445
Who's sick?

348
00:32:45,485 --> 00:32:48,285
I didn't start coughing
until you suddenly scared me like that.

349
00:32:55,725 --> 00:32:58,125
Why are you posing?

350
00:32:58,205 --> 00:32:59,645
There's nobody's here.

351
00:33:00,005 --> 00:33:01,125
Go home now.

352
00:33:01,205 --> 00:33:03,325
Is that how you speak to King Chu?

353
00:33:03,725 --> 00:33:05,085
King Chu?

354
00:33:05,405 --> 00:33:07,805
Strictly speaking, I'm your sister-in-law.

355
00:33:07,885 --> 00:33:08,845
Go away.

356
00:33:10,445 --> 00:33:12,165
Come on. I didn't come here for nothing.

357
00:33:12,725 --> 00:33:14,605
Who asked you to come here?

358
00:33:16,325 --> 00:33:20,365
I wanted to ask you... I didn't do
anything to you yesterday, did I?

359
00:33:21,925 --> 00:33:24,045
A tiny person like you?
Taking advantage of me?

360
00:33:24,125 --> 00:33:25,005
In your dreams.

361
00:33:36,605 --> 00:33:37,805
Let me tell you a story.

362
00:33:38,565 --> 00:33:39,525
Sure.

363
00:33:41,605 --> 00:33:42,565
I have a secret crush.

364
00:33:43,925 --> 00:33:46,805
You have a secret crush?
What year are you living in?

365
00:33:48,125 --> 00:33:51,205
You're that shy?
You should just tell the person.

366
00:33:57,205 --> 00:33:59,285
-I can't.
-Why?

367
00:34:02,365 --> 00:34:03,965
<i>Because that person is you.</i>

368
00:34:08,845 --> 00:34:10,245
Fine, don't tell me then.

369
00:34:10,765 --> 00:34:13,445
Go on with your story.

370
00:34:15,085 --> 00:34:15,925
That was it.

371
00:34:17,204 --> 00:34:18,885
That was one sentence.

372
00:34:19,405 --> 00:34:21,045
That sentence is a story.

373
00:34:21,644 --> 00:34:23,965
A predestined, unending story.

374
00:34:25,085 --> 00:34:28,644
God, you're a hipster now.

375
00:34:28,925 --> 00:34:31,405
How unsuitable for a playboy like you.

376
00:34:32,405 --> 00:34:34,565
Hey, can you not ruin the mood?

377
00:34:34,644 --> 00:34:35,765
I'm not wrong.

378
00:34:36,164 --> 00:34:38,885
Fight for who you like.
Leave who you don't like.

379
00:34:39,565 --> 00:34:41,805
Destiny is in your own hands.

380
00:34:42,164 --> 00:34:45,125
When did you become such a sissy?

381
00:34:45,925 --> 00:34:49,204
Got it, life coach.

382
00:34:50,125 --> 00:34:53,125
If you keep lecturing me,
we're going to have to camp here tonight.

383
00:34:54,244 --> 00:34:57,525
Oh! Tongtong is still waiting
for me up there.

384
00:34:58,724 --> 00:34:59,845
Let's go.

385
00:35:04,965 --> 00:35:07,285
Xia Lin, I thought you'd got lost.

386
00:35:07,365 --> 00:35:08,685
I was about to go look for you.

387
00:35:08,765 --> 00:35:10,565
Sorry, I lost track of time.

388
00:35:12,325 --> 00:35:13,165
Let's go now.

389
00:35:13,725 --> 00:35:15,005
It's fine. I drove here.

390
00:35:16,925 --> 00:35:18,605
Wait, Xia Lin, did you lose an earring?

391
00:35:20,645 --> 00:35:22,725
I might have lost it on accident.

392
00:35:23,005 --> 00:35:24,005
Just forget about it.

393
00:35:24,405 --> 00:35:27,485
But these are my favorite pair.
They've got a crescent moon on them.

394
00:35:27,565 --> 00:35:30,005
Just buy another pair online.

395
00:35:30,085 --> 00:35:30,965
Go home now.

396
00:35:31,765 --> 00:35:33,885
Fine, then you should go home, too

397
00:35:34,245 --> 00:35:35,645
-Bye.
-Bye.

398
00:36:00,805 --> 00:36:02,805
A rather unusual way of greeting me today.

399
00:36:08,045 --> 00:36:09,165
Where did you get this?

400
00:36:09,245 --> 00:36:11,005
Don't worry about where it came from.

401
00:36:12,725 --> 00:36:14,805
She's Ling Yizhou's woman.
Don't you know that?

402
00:36:16,605 --> 00:36:17,445
So what?

403
00:36:31,725 --> 00:36:34,365
You rotten child.
If Ling Yizhou finds out,

404
00:36:34,445 --> 00:36:36,325
the Chu family's prosperity
will be ruined!

405
00:36:46,845 --> 00:36:48,045
Are you happy now?

406
00:36:49,245 --> 00:36:52,925
My last name is not Chu. I don't want
to be a part of this family either.

407
00:36:53,285 --> 00:36:54,845
You have no say in this.

408
00:36:55,245 --> 00:36:58,685
You're right, I have no say.

409
00:36:59,125 --> 00:37:03,525
I didn't choose to join,
and I can't choose to leave.

410
00:37:04,485 --> 00:37:05,445
But...

411
00:37:30,525 --> 00:37:33,125
-Hello?
<i>-Xia Lin, have you seen the news?</i>

412
00:37:33,205 --> 00:37:35,205
<i>Chu Yan has been sent to the hospital.</i>

413
00:37:35,605 --> 00:37:36,445
What?

414
00:37:36,525 --> 00:37:38,805
GANGDONG INTERNATIONAL MEDICAL CENTER

415
00:37:46,965 --> 00:37:48,325
What are you doing here?

416
00:37:48,765 --> 00:37:50,005
You did this, didn't you?

417
00:37:50,085 --> 00:37:53,845
Mrs. Ling, you shouldn't worry
about our family affairs.

418
00:37:53,925 --> 00:37:55,325
Violence is illegal.

419
00:37:55,645 --> 00:37:57,285
If you do this again, I'll report you!

420
00:37:57,365 --> 00:37:59,405
Police won't interfere in family affairs.

421
00:37:59,485 --> 00:38:01,565
Chu Yan is my son, anyway.

422
00:38:01,965 --> 00:38:03,845
It's only natural that I discipline him.

423
00:38:04,205 --> 00:38:05,925
You're not his biological father.

424
00:38:07,125 --> 00:38:07,965
Say that again.

425
00:38:08,285 --> 00:38:09,765
-I said, you--
-Director Chu.

426
00:38:12,725 --> 00:38:13,885
Yizhou.

427
00:38:13,965 --> 00:38:15,885
Did I not make myself clear last time?

428
00:38:18,205 --> 00:38:19,605
Xia Lin is my wife.

429
00:38:20,125 --> 00:38:21,925
I don't care if you act like
that towards me.

430
00:38:22,005 --> 00:38:23,925
But if you do so to her...

431
00:38:25,005 --> 00:38:27,245
Director Ling, this is a misunderstanding.

432
00:38:30,045 --> 00:38:32,725
As luck would have it,
I have something prepared for you today.

433
00:38:33,325 --> 00:38:34,965
Do take a look, Director Chu.

434
00:38:36,405 --> 00:38:37,405
We can speak outside.

435
00:38:43,605 --> 00:38:46,285
Xia Lin, just wait in here.

436
00:38:46,885 --> 00:38:48,165
Lots of reporters around.

437
00:38:50,645 --> 00:38:53,005
That scared me.

438
00:38:53,565 --> 00:38:54,405
It's fine.

439
00:39:03,685 --> 00:39:07,125
Director Chu,
these documents I've prepared today

440
00:39:07,845 --> 00:39:09,245
represent no ulterior motives.

441
00:39:10,405 --> 00:39:13,085
I'm sure you understand
that any one of these papers,

442
00:39:13,645 --> 00:39:15,125
if handed over to the authorities...

443
00:39:16,125 --> 00:39:17,845
would cost you dearly.

444
00:39:19,925 --> 00:39:20,965
What do you want?

445
00:39:21,045 --> 00:39:23,765
I just have one tiny request.

446
00:39:24,965 --> 00:39:26,325
Let Chu Yan leave the Chu family.

447
00:39:27,605 --> 00:39:28,445
Never.

448
00:39:29,965 --> 00:39:31,725
I have just one son.

449
00:39:35,405 --> 00:39:38,165
Have you ever treated him as a son?

450
00:39:39,845 --> 00:39:42,645
Ever since he was adopted at two,
you've been cruel and harsh.

451
00:39:42,925 --> 00:39:46,205
No matter how much you hated his mother,
it's no way to treat an innocent child.

452
00:39:47,965 --> 00:39:49,965
What? You know?

453
00:39:53,205 --> 00:39:55,845
Yes. I know that
he's not your adopted son,

454
00:39:56,725 --> 00:39:58,125
but your own child.

455
00:39:59,165 --> 00:40:03,365
His mother abandoned us.

456
00:40:04,765 --> 00:40:08,405
It doesn't matter who did what,
Chu Yan was never involved.

457
00:40:12,605 --> 00:40:14,125
If I ever find out after this

458
00:40:14,565 --> 00:40:17,165
that you are hurting Chu Yan in any way,

459
00:40:17,245 --> 00:40:19,565
or if you force him to do something
he doesn't want to do...

460
00:40:21,845 --> 00:40:24,165
I can have you sent to jail
whenever I like.

461
00:41:34,965 --> 00:41:35,805
You know everything?

462
00:41:39,725 --> 00:41:41,045
I received that video.

463
00:41:42,765 --> 00:41:44,125
Your dad probably did, too.

464
00:41:45,125 --> 00:41:47,245
Listen to me,
I really didn't do anything to Xia Lin.

465
00:41:49,005 --> 00:41:50,045
I believe you.

466
00:41:52,005 --> 00:41:54,645
This is the last time you'll get hurt
for something like that.

467
00:41:55,845 --> 00:41:56,725
Get some rest.

468
00:41:57,645 --> 00:41:59,605
When you recover,
you can leave that family.

469
00:42:00,565 --> 00:42:01,485
Really?

470
00:42:01,845 --> 00:42:03,725
But... how?

471
00:42:08,205 --> 00:42:09,525
You're like a brother to me.

472
00:42:17,605 --> 00:42:18,725
I'm sorry.

473
00:42:20,645 --> 00:42:22,925
You don't need to apologize
for liking someone.

474
00:42:23,925 --> 00:42:26,405
That's the most beautiful thing
in the world.

475
00:42:28,845 --> 00:42:30,645
It shows I made the right choice.

476
00:42:33,325 --> 00:42:34,685
Xia Lin is my wife.

477
00:42:36,765 --> 00:42:37,925
You are my brother.

478
00:42:38,965 --> 00:42:40,045
That will never change.

479
00:42:42,325 --> 00:42:43,405
That will never change.

480
00:42:58,805 --> 00:43:01,165
What should we do?
You look like you're in a lot of pain.

481
00:43:01,245 --> 00:43:03,245
If only we had realized back
at the hospital...

482
00:43:03,685 --> 00:43:04,565
I'm fine.

483
00:43:07,885 --> 00:43:09,405
I'll be better after some sugar water.

484
00:43:09,485 --> 00:43:11,605
There's some in the fridge.

485
00:43:12,245 --> 00:43:13,605
Hold on, I'll get you some.

486
00:43:16,925 --> 00:43:20,605
I think we're out. I'll go get you some.

487
00:43:21,645 --> 00:43:23,525
It's late now. Don't bother.

488
00:43:24,125 --> 00:43:25,525
You must be hungry. Eat something

489
00:43:25,605 --> 00:43:26,645
I can't do that.

490
00:43:27,165 --> 00:43:29,965
I'll get some food on the way.
You just rest here.

491
00:43:30,245 --> 00:43:31,085
Xia Lin.

FIRE AT GANGDONG HOSPITAL

501
00:46:19,325 --> 00:46:20,245
Chu Yan is gone.

502
00:46:20,965 --> 00:46:22,045
It's true.

503
00:46:22,765 --> 00:46:24,405
The police are already investigating it.

504
00:46:25,725 --> 00:46:27,165
The coroner's autopsy was released.

505
00:46:27,605 --> 00:46:30,085
Chu Yan was holding
an earring in his right hand.

506
00:46:30,805 --> 00:46:32,285
Your earring was in his hand.

507
00:46:32,725 --> 00:46:34,925
With no other evidence besides this...

508
00:46:35,885 --> 00:46:37,005
you're the primary suspect.

509
00:46:37,405 --> 00:46:38,245
So...

510
00:46:38,325 --> 00:46:39,845
Regarding Mr. Chu Yan's death,

511
00:46:39,925 --> 00:46:41,765
we'd like to ask
for Miss Xia's cooperation.

512
00:46:41,845 --> 00:46:43,485
You were away from the apartment
