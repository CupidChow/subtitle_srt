[Episode 15]

4
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:42,000
Don't do that.

5
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:44,270
You will be banished into the mortal world

6
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:47,410
to suffer a lot of hardships.

7
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:48,410
Qing.

8
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:51,550
You had accompanied me for thousands of years beside the Wuding River.

9
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:53,640
How can I stand by and watch?

10
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,310
I won't let you

11
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,490
suffer hardships alone.

12
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:01,630
Qing.

13
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:02,900
Wait for me.

14
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:06,970
Border Patrol God.

15
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:09,500
It's me.

16
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:10,930
It's me.

17
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:12,180
Qing.

18
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:13,910
You finally remember.

19
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:15,730
You remember everything, right?

20
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:20,200
Beside the Wuding River,

21
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:22,890
we had been together for thousands of years.

22
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:25,550
Seven volumes of the Book of Heaven.

23
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:29,920
You enlightened me?

24
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:31,340
Yes.

25
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:32,630
Yes.

26
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:34,530
Great!

27
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:35,650
Great!

28
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:36,670
Qing,

29
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:38,880
you finally remember our past.

30
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:40,670
Qing.

31
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:43,150
Now that you have regained your consciousness of god,

32
00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:44,610
nothing

33
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:45,990
can stop us anymore.

34
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:47,880
Qing,

35
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:49,950
go with me.

36
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:52,530
Let's study the seven volumes of the Book of Heaven together.

37
00:02:53,579 --> 00:02:54,660
I will find a way

38
00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:56,230
to get your dharma-laksana back.

39
00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:59,440
And we'll return to the God Realm together.

40
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:00,830
OK?

41
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:25,230
Return to the God Realm together.

42
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:31,780
We have experienced

43
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:33,520
the elapse of time,

44
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:35,510
a lot of hardships,

45
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:37,120
and the separation in life and death.

46
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:38,660
Qing.

47
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:41,120
We've suffered too much together,

48
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:43,170
so that we can

49
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,540
return to the God Realm together.

50
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:48,220
Qing.

51
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:49,890
I've waited for too long

52
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:52,180
for this day to come.

53
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:55,240
I don't want to wait anymore.

54
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:56,500
Okay?

55
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:00,580
I'm Ji Ruochen from the Taichang Palace of Xixuan.

56
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:02,330
Fairy. Nice to meet you.

57
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:04,880
In terms of beauty,

58
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:07,120
this lady is not bad.

59
00:04:19,899 --> 00:04:20,420
No.

60
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:22,600
No.

61
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:23,050
Qing.

62
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:24,580
I am right here.

63
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:25,940
Where are you going?

64
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:28,640
Qing.

65
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:31,180
You've remembered me, right?

66
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:33,190
Why are you still hesitating?

67
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:36,520
Have you forgotten

68
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:39,370
my love for you for thousands of years

69
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:42,070
and my company in life and death for 99 lifetimes?

70
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:44,770
Is everything I did

71
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,190
not as important as

72
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:48,270
Ji Ruochen in your eyes?

73
00:04:58,520 --> 00:04:59,330
Yinfeng.

74
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:02,620
I'm grateful for your love for me.

75
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,190
But I can't repay you in this life.

76
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:08,570
I don't understand

77
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:11,810
why

78
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,960
everything in this life is wrong.

79
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:24,990
Qing.

80
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:27,100
It's okay.

81
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,440
Take your time.

82
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:32,950
You don't have to accept it.

83
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:35,460
But please allow me

84
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:37,820
to help get your dharma-laksana back.

85
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:39,540
OK?

86
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:44,590
Why do you have to do this?

87
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:48,330
I told you.

88
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:50,409
I am willing

89
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:52,070
to do anything

90
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:54,190
for you.

91
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:27,980
Come out.

92
00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:30,270
I don't like people hiding.

93
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,130
I was worried about your injury.

94
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:46,290
Now it seems that

95
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:47,830
Yun Zhong Ju

96
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:50,070
is indeed a good place for recuperating.

97
00:06:52,090 --> 00:06:53,030
I accept

98
00:06:53,570 --> 00:06:54,490
your kindness.

99
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:57,260
Why did you come here personally?

100
00:06:57,670 --> 00:06:58,909
Aren't you afraid of causing trouble?

101
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:01,460
What do you mean?

102
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:06,200
You broke into my room

103
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,180
and eavesdropped on me.

104
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:10,390
If Qing weren't here just now,

105
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:11,180
it could have been

106
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:13,420
the last time for you

107
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,850
to enjoy Yun Zhong Ju's scenery.

108
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:16,960
Tell me.

109
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:18,120
Why did you come to me?

110
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:21,260
Ji Ruochen is now trapped in Mount Luoran.

111
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:23,420
It's a good time to take action.

112
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,430
Although

113
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:30,340
I'm still a disciple of Qingxu Sect,

114
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:32,900
what you said

115
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:35,100
sounds like killing him with a borrowed knife.

116
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,960
Sharing a common hatred against him is more accurate.

117
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:39,290
Yinfeng,

118
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:40,540
let me remind you.

119
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:44,080
Gu Qing will never turn back

120
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:46,860
until someone is killed by Dingtian Sword.

121
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:56,980
This Xuanxin ring

122
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:58,550
is a rare treasure.

123
00:07:58,880 --> 00:07:59,580
Why did you put so many useless things

124
00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:01,050
in it?

125
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:02,890
You should at least

126
00:08:02,890 --> 00:08:04,500
make yourself comfortable when you are not home, right?

127
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,800
These things are useful to me.

128
00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:07,790
I can't put living things in this ring.

129
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:08,820
Otherwise,

130
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:10,390
I would have put two horses in.

131
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:11,880
You even have a spatula?

132
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:15,060
This is for Senior Qiushui.

133
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:16,160
I think he will like it very much.

134
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:19,300
This looks good.

135
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:21,000
It should be easy-to-use.

136
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:22,090
Be careful.

137
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:23,340
This can't be used

138
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:24,680
to dig things.

139
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:27,250
Give me that thing.

140
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:29,830
Which one?

141
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:31,350
This one.

142
00:08:32,850 --> 00:08:34,530
Good tools are prerequisite

143
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:36,380
to the successful execution of a job.

144
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:38,250
People of Luoran School. Listen.

145
00:08:39,059 --> 00:08:40,950
Release Ji Ruochen and my senior.

146
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:42,490
Otherwise,

147
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:44,490
we'll break into your place

148
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:45,490
and destroy it.

149
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:47,990
You are as cowardly as a turtle retracting its head into its shell.

150
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:49,990
Come down if you dare!

151
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,680
Fight with me.

152
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:54,210
I'll dismantle your shells

153
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,050
and use them as flower pots.

154
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:57,900
And I'll kick the pots like kicking balls.

155
00:08:58,330 --> 00:08:59,040
Stop yelling.

156
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:01,050
Get ready to fight.

157
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:28,040
The formation of Mount Luoran is really powerful.

158
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,560
The true spirit has been imprisoned.

159
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:31,270
Looks like there will be a tough battle.

160
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:32,550
I can't wait to do it.

161
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:40,340
Release.

162
00:09:58,100 --> 00:09:58,630
Senior.

163
00:10:04,190 --> 00:10:05,140
Come. Senior.

164
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:05,980
Okay.

165
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:08,340
Sit here for a while.

166
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:11,010
Here. Be careful.

167
00:10:15,010 --> 00:10:15,590
Senior Bingxian.

168
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:16,490
How are you feeling?

169
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:19,020
I'm really embarrassed.

170
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,280
It's all my fault.

171
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:21,820
You got hurt because of me.

172
00:10:22,210 --> 00:10:23,220
We are from the same sect.

173
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:24,980
I don't like what you said.

174
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:33,610
Senior.

175
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:44,620
I... I'll do it myself.

176
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:52,420
I was careless.

177
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:54,020
It seems that you and I

178
00:10:54,890 --> 00:10:56,910
are not strong enough to save Ruochen and Yinyin.

179
00:10:57,980 --> 00:10:58,860
We need help.

180
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:01,010
But Yinyin was kicked out of the sect.

181
00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:03,090
We can't ask masters for help.

182
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:03,660
I...

183
00:11:06,610 --> 00:11:08,290
Right. I'll ask Qiushui for help.

184
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:12,300
It seems that's the only way.

185
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:14,220
We can only do it step by step.

186
00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:15,970
Go now.

187
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:16,320
Okay.

188
00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:25,900
Senior.

189
00:11:27,130 --> 00:11:28,200
Wait for me to come back.

190
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:30,210
Okay.

191
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:32,680
Wait for me, Senior.

192
00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:43,740
[Yun Zhong Ju]

193
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:46,720
Honey.

194
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:50,300
How about combing my hair every day?

195
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:53,260
As long as you are happy,

196
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:54,980
I can do this every day.

197
00:12:04,970 --> 00:12:06,700
How dare you barge in?

198
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:07,930
Let me inform him first.

199
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:09,660
No need. I'm his bro.

200
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:10,690
-Xuanzhen. -No. You can't go in.

201
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:12,610
-Let me in. -No.

202
00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:14,560
-You can't go in. -It's an emergency.

203
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:15,790
Qiushui. Something happened.

204
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:16,310
Come with me!

205
00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:16,730
Senior.

206
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:17,320
What's wrong?

207
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:19,250
You are his bro.

208
00:12:19,330 --> 00:12:20,500
I'm his wife.

209
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:21,460
If you want help,

210
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:23,010
shouldn't you let me know first?

211
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:25,130
How could you just break in and take him away?

212
00:12:25,170 --> 00:12:26,560
Someone will die if we don't hurry.

213
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:27,880
Senior Bingxian is severely injured.

214
00:12:28,050 --> 00:12:29,450
Yinyin and Ruochen were captured.

215
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:30,300
What?

216
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:31,970
Honey.

217
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:33,110
This is serious.

218
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:34,260
Let me go with Xuanzhen.

219
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:35,060
I'll go with you.

220
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:35,460
No.

221
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:37,100
I'll be distracted if you go.

222
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:39,070
Besides, if Yun Zhong Ju intervenes in this,

223
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:40,690
things will get worse.

224
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:41,430
Wait for me to come back.

225
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:42,370
Come with me now.

226
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:42,890
Wait.

227
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:18,900
I lost my dharma-laksana.

228
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:20,580
It's useless no matter how hard I practice.

229
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:23,060
Calm down.

230
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:24,340
Take your time.

231
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:26,480
Take a rest.

232
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:41,990
Has Master returned from Mount Huayun?

233
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:43,780
He should be back tomorrow.

234
00:13:45,690 --> 00:13:46,440
Senior.

235
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:48,200
While Master is away,

236
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:49,970
someone is really lawless.

237
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:52,550
What does he think Yun Zhong Ju is?

238
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:53,540
He just broke in.

239
00:13:55,950 --> 00:13:56,450
Tan.

240
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:58,380
Yinfeng is my guest.

241
00:13:58,550 --> 00:13:59,430
You can't say anything like that.

242
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:00,430
No. No. No.

243
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:01,860
I'm not talking about him.

244
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:03,900
I'm talking about those guys from Xixuan.

245
00:14:04,530 --> 00:14:05,700
Xixuan's men came here?

246
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:06,590
Who?

247
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:09,420
It seems his name is Xuanzhen.

248
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:11,980
He took Qiushui away without a word.

249
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:14,900
He said Ji Ruochen was captured.

250
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:16,900
And he would die if they didn't go immediately.

251
00:14:22,770 --> 00:14:24,010
That fake banished god

252
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:25,490
has nothing to do

253
00:14:25,690 --> 00:14:26,630
with Yun Zhong Ju.

254
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:27,960
Tan.

255
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:30,110
Why are you gossiping here

256
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:31,720
about it?

257
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:34,510
Senior...

258
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:44,640
Qing.

259
00:14:45,730 --> 00:14:48,810
Your divine power was unstable.

260
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:52,200
You need to keep calm.

261
00:14:57,820 --> 00:14:58,380
Did you get hurt?

262
00:14:58,900 --> 00:14:59,370
Are you okay?

263
00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:01,870
I'm fine.

264
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:05,730
Yinfeng, I'm tired.

265
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:08,040
Let's continue another day.

266
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:16,240
It seems that

267
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:18,420
Xuxuan was right.

268
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:32,470
Let's go.

269
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:45,310
If you surrender,

270
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:47,390
I'll treat you well.

271
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:50,550
But if you insist on fighting,

272
00:15:51,130 --> 00:15:52,810
don't blame my men

273
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:54,290
for being merciless.

274
00:15:54,690 --> 00:15:56,190
Xuanzhen. Can you break it?

275
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,440
Why did I ask you to come if I can?

276
00:15:57,670 --> 00:15:59,170
So with or without me,

277
00:15:59,350 --> 00:16:00,230
it won't change anything.

278
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:02,220
Cut the crap. Just fight.

279
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:07,800
Even though it won't change anything,

280
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:08,510
count me in.

281
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:10,410
Qingyi.

282
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:12,640
Those little monsters were not efficient in searching information.

283
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:13,650
I'm late.

284
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:14,480
Sorry.

285
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:15,830
You are not late.

286
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:16,710
You came just in time.

287
00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:20,780
Xixuan Sect has colluded with the demon clan.

288
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:23,940
How dare you say you're a decent sect?

289
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:25,440
Old man.

290
00:16:25,910 --> 00:16:27,340
It seems that you are the leader.

291
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:29,190
Before I came, Uncle specially told me,

292
00:16:29,370 --> 00:16:30,760
"Cut the crap when you arrive.

293
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:31,450
Just blow it up first."

294
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:32,730
Since you're here,

295
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:33,910
I'm telling you this.

296
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,290
Otherwise, others will think people from the Endless Sea are rude.

297
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:43,030
Senior. Be careful.

298
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:43,820
What's there to be afraid of?

299
00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:45,700
With Luoran's formation,

300
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:47,860
I don't think they can cause any trouble.

301
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:03,530
The back mountain?

302
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:04,900
I don't believe you.

303
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:05,630
This is Luoran...

304
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:08,710
Hurry.

305
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:14,530
This is Luoran School's hall.

306
00:17:14,930 --> 00:17:15,819
Anyway,

307
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:16,800
we escaped.

308
00:17:17,010 --> 00:17:17,540
Everyone,

309
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:20,069
it's time to show what we are really capable of.

310
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:23,530
We made this with the Endless Sea's treasures.

311
00:17:23,589 --> 00:17:24,480
Wonderful! Wonderful!

312
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:26,130
The Dragon and Tiger Universal Cannon.

313
00:17:43,870 --> 00:17:44,600
The Universal Cannon?

314
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:45,850
It must be the Universal Cannon.

315
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:47,500
It must be Qingyi, Dragon Elephant, and White Tiger.

316
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:48,180
They are here to save us.

317
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:51,490
That's great.

318
00:17:52,610 --> 00:17:53,360
Our swords.

319
00:17:54,570 --> 00:17:55,270
Senior.

320
00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:56,350
Catch them!

321
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:56,980
Senior.

322
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:57,880
Don't let them escape.

323
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:00,450
Senior.

324
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:05,000
Senior.

325
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:37,380
Yinfeng.

326
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,540
How have you been after we parted beside Hao River?

327
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:41,450
Thanks to you,

328
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:42,960
just so-so.

329
00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:44,510
What's between us

330
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:45,900
has nothing to do with Yinyin.

331
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:47,100
Let her go first.

332
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:50,030
You are right.

333
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:51,490
Cut the crap.

334
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:52,470
Yinyin.

335
00:18:53,230 --> 00:18:54,510
He has regained his divine power.

336
00:18:54,770 --> 00:18:55,760
Even if we fight together,

337
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:57,160
we can't defeat him.

338
00:18:57,630 --> 00:18:58,770
We have to try.

339
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:08,690
If I tell them you are the real banished god,

340
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:09,660
can we negotiate?

341
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:10,540
If it weren't for you,

342
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:11,710
Gu Qing wouldn't have lost her dharma-laksana

343
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:12,980
and wouldn't be so stubborn.

344
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:14,950
Ji Ruochen.

345
00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:15,930
No matter what,

346
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:16,790
you have to die.

347
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:18,210
You want to kill me.

348
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:19,300
I have nothing to say.

349
00:19:20,870 --> 00:19:22,830
But I have someone to protect too.

350
00:19:35,770 --> 00:19:36,900
You were lucky to escape back then,

351
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:38,650
because the dreadstar descended upon your fate.

352
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:40,060
This time,

353
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:41,960
I won't fail.

354
00:20:10,290 --> 00:20:10,610
This...

355
00:20:11,850 --> 00:20:12,570
Is this...

356
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:19,590
Yinfeng.

357
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:28,120
Qing.

358
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:31,290
Yinfeng.

359
00:20:32,210 --> 00:20:34,730
My engagement with Ji Ruochen has been canceled.

360
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:36,460
Why are you still going to kill him?

361
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:40,690
Now when I think about it,

362
00:20:41,290 --> 00:20:43,430
I know he and I are not meant to be together.

363
00:20:44,130 --> 00:20:45,730
I can't force it.

364
00:20:46,930 --> 00:20:47,440
Qing,

365
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:49,550
are you serious?

366
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:51,280
Of course.

367
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:54,130
After all, you are the master of the bluestone.

368
00:20:54,530 --> 00:20:56,530
You are the one who made a 100-lifetime appointment with me.

369
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:57,470
In the future,

370
00:20:57,620 --> 00:20:59,480
we'll return to the God Realm together.

371
00:21:00,030 --> 00:21:01,510
Let's not care about

372
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:02,710
these worldly conflicts.

373
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:04,320
As for this fake banished god,

374
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:09,700
show mercy to him

375
00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:11,430
and let him go.

376
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:16,320
You are not Gu Qing.

377
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:20,560
I'm your ancestor.

378
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:27,310
Stop!

379
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:30,970
Qing.

380
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:33,440
Gu Qing.

381
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:35,830
Are you okay?

382
00:21:56,570 --> 00:21:58,090
This is between me and Yinfeng.

383
00:21:58,730 --> 00:21:59,540
It has nothing to do with you.

384
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:01,240
You can leave.

385
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:04,010
Thank you for helping us, Fairy Gu.

386
00:22:05,770 --> 00:22:06,210
Let's go.

387
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:14,020
Thank you.

388
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,140
Thank you for saving Ruochen today.

389
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:21,070
And thank Yun Zhong Ju for saving my father.

390
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:24,660
Saving your father

391
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:26,540
is out of the friendship between the two sects.

392
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:28,790
You don't have to thank me.

393
00:22:30,890 --> 00:22:32,000
Whether you accept it or not,

394
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:35,120
I showed my sincere gratitude to you today.

395
00:22:38,850 --> 00:22:39,270
Let's go.

396
00:22:48,350 --> 00:22:49,030
Be careful.

397
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:52,230
Yinyin.

398
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:54,210
Xuanzhen.

399
00:22:54,590 --> 00:22:55,600
-Ruochen.
-Yinyin.

400
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:56,880
-You are all here.
-Mr. Ji.

401
00:22:57,170 --> 00:22:58,240
Senior. Qiushui.

402
00:22:58,350 --> 00:22:59,230
Why are you all here?

403
00:22:59,250 --> 00:22:59,820
How are you?

404
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:00,500
Are you hurt?

405
00:23:00,550 --> 00:23:01,590
Did they hit you?

406
00:23:01,850 --> 00:23:02,930
We're fine. Don't worry.

407
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:04,060
How is my father?

408
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,910
He has been completely detoxified.

409
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:06,950
Don't worry.

410
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:09,020
Your mother is taking good care of him.

411
00:23:09,190 --> 00:23:10,070
He's fine now.

412
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:11,570
By the way,

413
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:12,810
how did you two get out?

414
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,200
We were going to save you in prison.

415
00:23:14,690 --> 00:23:15,320
Don't mention it.

416
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:16,900
We were like rats

417
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:17,910
and came out from a hole.

418
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:21,810
Well. Yinyin,

419
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:24,500
why don't we go back to Xixuan together?

420
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:25,710
That's right.

421
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:36,420
After all,

422
00:23:37,510 --> 00:23:38,510
everyone knows

423
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:39,550
I have become a monster.

424
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:41,240
If I go back now,

425
00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:42,840
I will make Junior Master Ziyang in an awkward situation.

426
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:48,470
Yinyin,

427
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:51,410
are you really not going back

428
00:23:51,770 --> 00:23:52,930
to check on Junior Master Jingxiao?

429
00:23:57,090 --> 00:23:58,730
We will definitely go back to Xixuan Mountains.

430
00:23:59,180 --> 00:23:59,910
But not now.

431
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:01,480
If one day,

432
00:24:01,730 --> 00:24:03,000
Yinyin really misses you,

433
00:24:03,230 --> 00:24:04,040
we will definitely go back.

434
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:06,290
Fine.

435
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:08,160
The branches of Xixuan Sect

436
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:09,030
are all over the world.

437
00:24:09,670 --> 00:24:10,520
You two,

438
00:24:11,230 --> 00:24:12,400
don't make yourselves wronged.

439
00:24:14,190 --> 00:24:15,150
Thank you, Senior Qiushui.

440
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:16,460
Yinyin and I will never forget

441
00:24:16,810 --> 00:24:17,940
your kindness.

442
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:20,570
This is goodbye then.

443
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:21,700
Qingyi.

444
00:24:22,610 --> 00:24:24,250
Please send my regards to Mr. Wu and Ling.

445
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:26,150
Shui.

446
00:24:26,710 --> 00:24:29,050
Wish you a happy marriage. And have a baby soon.

447
00:24:33,410 --> 00:24:34,170
All right.

448
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:37,070
Let's go.

449
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:46,180
Yinyin. Mr. Ji.

450
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:47,540
Take care.

451
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:49,220
I don't know

452
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:51,850
when we can meet again.

453
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:54,540
We can't stay here for long.

454
00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:56,070
Let's talk on the way.

455
00:24:57,250 --> 00:24:57,590
Okay.

456
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:04,260
I knew you'd come.

457
00:25:07,430 --> 00:25:08,890
I should be the one to say that.

458
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:10,910
That's right.

459
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:13,300
It is what you saw.

460
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:15,460
I wanted to kill him.

461
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:18,080
It's impossible for me to be with him anymore.

462
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:21,150
You know that.

463
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:23,890
Then why do you have to kill him?

464
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:25,790
Because only in this way,

465
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:28,720
can you focus on practicing the seven volumes of the Book of Heaven

466
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:30,350
to get your dharma-laksana back.

467
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:35,630
Was it really you

468
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:36,740
who spent 99 lifetimes with me?

469
00:25:39,150 --> 00:25:40,080
If the person

470
00:25:40,670 --> 00:25:42,580
who made the 100-lifetime appointment with me

471
00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:45,230
is as narrow-minded as you

472
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:46,940
and kills innocent people,

473
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:51,020
I would rather be alone in this mortal world

474
00:25:51,450 --> 00:25:52,570
for the rest of my life.

475
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:06,500
Demon.

476
00:26:07,130 --> 00:26:07,790
He's a demon.

477
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:09,170
Ji Ruochen is a demon.

478
00:26:10,150 --> 00:26:10,580
Demon.

479
00:26:10,950 --> 00:26:11,520
He is a demon.

480
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:12,590
Ji Ruochen is a demon.

481
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:13,970
I'm perfectly justified in killing him.

482
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:14,490
Yinfeng.

483
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:17,580
I never thought

484
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:20,160
you would slander others for your own greed.

485
00:26:21,130 --> 00:26:22,410
I was wrong about you.

486
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:23,290
I'm not.

487
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:24,340
I didn't lie to you.

488
00:26:24,850 --> 00:26:25,780
I saw with my own eyes

489
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:27,150
that he has the energy of the Nine Hells.

490
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:28,940
Ji Ruochen must be a demon.

491
00:26:29,150 --> 00:26:30,340
Qing, you must trust me.

492
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:31,060
Stop talking.

493
00:26:33,490 --> 00:26:34,620
I don't want to talk to you anymore.

494
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:35,860
You don't need to return to Yun Zhong Ju either.

495
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:36,860
You're not welcome there.

496
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:39,740
As for returning to the God Realm,

497
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:41,710
help yourself.

498
00:26:53,010 --> 00:26:55,020
The weaving skill is very exquisite.

499
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:57,110
And look at the voile.

500
00:26:57,180 --> 00:26:57,980
Touch it with your hands.

501
00:26:57,980 --> 00:26:59,620
I don't like this color.

502
00:27:01,790 --> 00:27:03,060
This one is also good.

503
00:27:07,290 --> 00:27:07,840
How do I look?

504
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:25,700
You look amazing

505
00:27:26,130 --> 00:27:27,080
in this outfit.

506
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,380
I just don't know

507
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:32,230
where I can hang this.

508
00:27:32,730 --> 00:27:33,940
If I hang it here,

509
00:27:34,670 --> 00:27:35,890
I think it's too long.

510
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:38,590
Neither of the two sides is okay.

511
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:40,740
Hang it up here?

512
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:48,450
♫With flowers and leaves in this mortal world♫

513
00:27:48,970 --> 00:27:53,970
♫I understand the entanglement and obsession♫

514
00:27:54,650 --> 00:27:59,680
♫With smiles and words in this life♫

515
00:28:00,350 --> 00:28:04,260
♫I wish time could stand still♫

516
00:28:04,310 --> 00:28:07,070
♫So that I can always keep you with me♫

517
00:28:07,090 --> 00:28:11,050
♫With strings and swords in this mortal world♫

518
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:16,990
♫I'm willing to let go but I hate time♫

519
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:22,220
♫The moon is always full and the sea will dry♫

520
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:26,270
♫I dare not say goodbye♫

521
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:30,840
I didn't know you know how to do this.

522
00:28:31,770 --> 00:28:33,890
Huaniang taught me these.

523
00:28:34,670 --> 00:28:35,780
She said this knot

524
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:36,850
is called the lovesickness knot.

525
00:28:37,610 --> 00:28:38,320
Once it's tied,

526
00:28:38,850 --> 00:28:39,890
it'll be hard to untie it.

527
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:42,370
Do you know how to do it?

528
00:28:44,430 --> 00:28:45,510
I was looking at you.

529
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:46,790
I wasn't learning to tie the knot.

530
00:28:47,470 --> 00:28:48,120
Let's go.

531
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:54,340
Boss, this is the money for this outfit.

532
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:55,130
Keep the change.

533
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:56,040
Okay.

534
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:02,640
Thank you.

535
00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:03,920
Come again.

536
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:04,490
Yinyin,

537
00:29:05,030 --> 00:29:06,420
let's find an inn to rest.

538
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:09,170
What kind of inn is this?

539
00:29:09,190 --> 00:29:10,400
It doesn't even have two rooms.

540
00:29:10,430 --> 00:29:12,470
Only one luxury suite is left.

541
00:29:12,990 --> 00:29:14,550
Didn't the boss say

542
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:16,900
this is a suite with two rooms?

543
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:18,510
We won't disturb each other.

544
00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:20,510
Pick one room.

545
00:29:22,210 --> 00:29:24,210
How can I pick first?

546
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:25,940
You should pick one first.

547
00:29:27,270 --> 00:29:28,470
I won't stand on ceremony.

548
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:29,430
I pick this one.

549
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:32,150
No problem.

550
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:34,930
I'm going to put things here.

551
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:50,050
Yinyin, are you okay?

552
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:51,640
I'm fine. Don't come here.

553
00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:09,670
You're dressing like this.

554
00:31:09,690 --> 00:31:10,490
You'd better not chase them.

555
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:11,420
No way.

556
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:12,860
We don't even know who they are.

557
00:31:13,290 --> 00:31:14,100
Judging from their appearance,

558
00:31:14,150 --> 00:31:15,020
they should be Luoran School's men.

559
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:16,700
I don't think

560
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:17,520
they'll come back for the moment.

561
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:25,370
Go back first.

562
00:33:08,770 --> 00:33:09,810
Ruochen.

563
00:33:12,170 --> 00:33:14,770
I didn't mean to break your heart.

564
00:33:23,530 --> 00:33:24,880
Even though you didn't mean it,

565
00:33:26,090 --> 00:33:27,500
I was really sad.

566
00:33:30,460 --> 00:33:32,080
I'm sorry.

567
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:34,120
Stop pretending.

568
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:37,770
If you want to apologize to me,

569
00:33:37,770 --> 00:33:39,750
get up and apologize to me.

570
00:33:39,820 --> 00:33:40,500
And I'll forgive you.

571
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:42,980
I'm not going to say it again.

572
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:45,700
Consider it as an apology.

573
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:48,580
Didn't you say

574
00:33:48,810 --> 00:33:49,720
in Luoran's dungeon

575
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:51,180
that you didn't do anything wrong

576
00:33:51,490 --> 00:33:52,330
and you don't need to apologize?

577
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:54,980
I'm the one who broke your heart.

578
00:33:55,510 --> 00:33:56,630
I should apologize to you.

579
00:33:59,970 --> 00:34:00,590
Alright.

580
00:34:01,690 --> 00:34:03,590
Let bygones be bygones.

581
00:34:05,030 --> 00:34:05,830
Let me ask you.

582
00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:07,860
Why did you come to my room

583
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:09,080
instead of sleeping?

584
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:12,900
You tell me why.

585
00:34:21,330 --> 00:34:22,699
I made great efforts to find you.

586
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:24,980
I'm afraid when I open my eyes,

587
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:26,280
you will disappear again.

588
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:28,380
So I'm worried.

589
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:31,050
I feel relieved

590
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:32,800
when I look at you like this.

591
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:36,300
How can I sleep

592
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:37,940
if you look at me like this?

593
00:34:42,389 --> 00:34:43,670
You can sleep here.

594
00:34:43,739 --> 00:34:45,550
I'll just sit there.

595
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:14,540
What's wrong?

596
00:35:15,890 --> 00:35:18,430
Maybe I ate too much at dinner.

597
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:20,270
I can't sleep.

598
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,330
Let me massage your belly.

599
00:35:22,590 --> 00:35:23,430
No, thanks.

600
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:24,850
I don't need a massage.

601
00:35:24,870 --> 00:35:25,770
Just sit here

602
00:35:26,070 --> 00:35:27,220
and chat with me.

603
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:29,920
OK.

604
00:35:30,950 --> 00:35:31,720
What do you want to talk about?

605
00:35:35,590 --> 00:35:36,430
Well.

606
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,790
If it weren't for Gu Qing today,

607
00:35:39,430 --> 00:35:41,360
we would have been killed by Yinfeng, right?

608
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:45,480
Yes.

609
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:49,480
I don't mean anything else.

610
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:50,590
Don't think too much.

611
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:53,990
Am I that petty?

612
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:56,510
I just want to ask

613
00:35:57,670 --> 00:35:59,190
if Gu Qing knows you were forced to marry her

614
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:00,480
for my father.

615
00:36:01,750 --> 00:36:03,070
She found it out later.

616
00:36:06,870 --> 00:36:08,690
I thought I was the only pitiful one.

617
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:12,860
I'm sorry to her.

618
00:36:15,830 --> 00:36:16,670
So,

619
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:18,620
we owe her a lot.

620
00:36:19,970 --> 00:36:21,410
Since we left Luoran School,

621
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:22,380
I've been thinking

622
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:24,810
how I should

623
00:36:25,250 --> 00:36:26,500
repay her.

624
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:28,940
I owe her my life too.

625
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:31,730
I don't know when I can repay her.

626
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:33,900
People often say

627
00:36:34,250 --> 00:36:35,310
don't worry about it when you are deeply in debt.

628
00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:36,950
We'll figure it out

629
00:36:37,350 --> 00:36:38,200
in the future.

630
00:36:40,650 --> 00:36:41,600
I'm not talking about it with you.

631
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:42,580
Sleep.

632
00:36:42,820 --> 00:36:43,460
I won't disturb you.

633
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:46,660
I haven't finished yet.

634
00:36:48,150 --> 00:36:48,770
What else?

635
00:36:49,490 --> 00:36:51,590
When you were paying at the tailor shop

636
00:36:51,730 --> 00:36:53,450
and here,

637
00:36:54,090 --> 00:36:55,600
you were quite generous.

638
00:36:56,020 --> 00:36:57,170
Where did you get the money?

639
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:01,770
This... This is my money.

640
00:37:02,730 --> 00:37:04,190
Where did you get so much money?

641
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:05,580
Did you

642
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:07,830
cheat someone out of his money

643
00:37:08,690 --> 00:37:09,470
or rob someone?

644
00:37:11,150 --> 00:37:12,430
Did you raid a tomb?

645
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:13,770
What are you talking about?

646
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:16,270
When I left Xixuan to look for you,

647
00:37:16,830 --> 00:37:18,230
Senior Qiushui gave the money to me.

648
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:24,180
Well. My money

649
00:37:24,260 --> 00:37:26,060
is also yours, right?

650
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:27,020
Give it to me.

651
00:37:28,070 --> 00:37:29,480
I told you.

652
00:37:29,550 --> 00:37:30,710
My money

653
00:37:30,740 --> 00:37:31,610
is also yours.

654
00:37:32,050 --> 00:37:34,000
Yes. Then give it to me.

655
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:39,930
That's all?

656
00:37:40,530 --> 00:37:41,580
Of course.

657
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:42,580
If you don't believe me,

658
00:37:42,870 --> 00:37:43,590
search my body.

659
00:37:49,070 --> 00:37:50,450
I really don't have any left.

660
00:37:52,290 --> 00:37:53,170
I am

661
00:37:53,450 --> 00:37:54,360
just afraid that

662
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:56,120
you will spend money like water.

663
00:37:56,140 --> 00:37:56,920
I'll keep it for you.

664
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:59,270
Go for wool and come home shorn.

665
00:37:59,540 --> 00:38:00,070
What did you say?

666
00:38:00,740 --> 00:38:03,780
I said I'm going to recite the Mind Purification Mantra again.

667
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:05,240
Go to sleep.

668
00:38:07,950 --> 00:38:09,370
The Mind Purification Mantra?

669
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:11,520
Why have I never heard of

670
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:13,250
anything like the Mind Purification Mantra?

671
00:38:16,750 --> 00:38:18,420
So much money.

672
00:38:19,190 --> 00:38:21,820
Mind purification. Mind purification.

673
00:38:22,930 --> 00:38:26,250
The Mind Purification Mantra.

674
00:38:26,830 --> 00:38:28,520
Mind purification.

675
00:38:32,260 --> 00:38:33,060
Who could it be?

676
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:34,560
It's in the middle of the night.

677
00:38:37,650 --> 00:38:38,340
Sir.

678
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:39,630
Boss.

679
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:40,640
What is it?

680
00:38:40,740 --> 00:38:42,220
It's in the middle of the night. Can't you come to me tomorrow?

681
00:38:42,510 --> 00:38:43,270
Please calm down.

682
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:46,120
Someone asked me to come here.

683
00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:48,180
What?

684
00:38:49,210 --> 00:38:50,610
Please pay.

685
00:38:51,210 --> 00:38:52,120
Pay for what?

686
00:38:53,620 --> 00:38:54,360
Wine.

687
00:38:55,220 --> 00:38:56,300
Wine?

688
00:38:56,740 --> 00:38:57,820
I didn't drink.

689
00:38:57,820 --> 00:38:58,780
Why should I pay for it?

690
00:38:59,260 --> 00:39:00,460
I know you didn't drink.

691
00:39:00,510 --> 00:39:02,360
The one who asked me to come here drank wine.

692
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:03,650
He said

693
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:06,210
you didn't pay for the book he gave you.

694
00:39:06,410 --> 00:39:07,890
So you should pay for the wine.

695
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:10,710
What's the name of that book?

696
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:13,540
Right. Qianyuan Manual.

697
00:39:15,740 --> 00:39:16,780
Qianyuan Manual?

698
00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:17,490
Yes.

699
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:19,100
Ji Tianxia.

700
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:21,670
Where is he now?
