4
00:02:08,009 --> 00:02:08,759
I know.

5
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:10,789
What do you know?

6
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,750
Do it. I don't care if they're alive or dead.

7
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:14,420
Got it.

8
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:15,790
Nice.

10
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,880
You hide in the Shenzhou Energy Map first.

11
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:19,740
I'll explain to you later.

12
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:49,660
So beautiful.

13
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:03,470
Could this be the Seven-Star Combination and space-time dislocation?

14
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:15,270
♫In an instant, crossing the finish line, looking back as if it were the first time♫

15
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:11,240
From now on, you'll be mine.

16
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:14,070
I'll protect you if you join Xixuan.

17
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:15,640

♫Together, we cultivate our love day and night, unaware of its depth♫

19

Where are you going?

20
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:20,710
You should at least praise me.

21
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:21,390
Look.

♫One year, one cycle♫

23
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:25,420
This bracelet is made of Demon Subduing Stones.

24
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:29,710
♫This Earthly Realm is warmer than the God Realm♫

25
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:28,480
If it's made of Demon Subduing Stones,

26
00:03:29,079 --> 00:03:32,240
it can definitely restrain some demonic energy

27
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:38,190
♫I've seen the world but longing remains unclear♫

28
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:33,940

29
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:35,829
Thus,

30
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:38,430
you'll feel better wearing it.

33

I can feel more relieved

34
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:44,329

♫So that I can always keep you with me♫

46
00:04:18,589 --> 00:04:19,920
There are many fluorite stones.

47

When we activate the fluorite,

48
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:24,460
♫With strings and swords in this mortal world♫

49
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:23,390

what I asked you to wear.

60
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:45,760
Didn't you ask me to wear it every day?

61
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:51,510
Senior, I really want to kiss you.

62
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:54,670
Don't you dare do that.

What's wrong?

122
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:08,010
Why are you crying?

123
00:10:12,050 --> 00:10:12,700
Nothing.

124
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:15,840
It's the rain.

125
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:18,930
It's okay to cry.

126
00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:19,980
No need to deny it.

127
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:28,230
Well.

128
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:32,310
Can you tell me

129
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:34,490
why I'm crying?

130
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:39,920
I remember now.

131
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:42,960
You pushed me into the Shenzhou Energy Map.

132
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,480
I seemed to see a lot of stars.

133
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:47,310
It's normal that

134
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:49,010
the Shenzhou Energy Map has a lot of stars.

135
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:51,470
Right.

136
00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:57,760
I think I saw us crying in front of each other.

137
00:10:58,930 --> 00:10:59,680
Ling was right.

138
00:11:00,770 --> 00:11:02,490
The solution is so simple,

139
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:04,030
but I'm hesitating.

140
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:05,950
I was wrong.

141
00:11:07,190 --> 00:11:09,230
Yinyin, from now on,

142
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:10,930
I won't let you get hurt anymore.

143
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:14,340
Leaving you is the best way.

144
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:18,870
-Xuanzhen.
-Yinyin.

145
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:19,660
-Senior.
-Ruochen.

146
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:22,100
Only the two of you?

147
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,430
Where are Qingyi and Senior Qiushui?

148
00:11:24,890 --> 00:11:26,150
We got the news from Shi Ji.

149
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:27,540
We agreed to go to Qingyi

150
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:28,980
after we met up.

151
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,510
But before we met them,

152
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:32,810
our hands and feet suddenly felt weak.

153
00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:34,230
So we came back quickly.

154
00:11:35,050 --> 00:11:38,830
Ji Ruochen, since you have chosen this path,

155
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:41,570
I'll grant your wish.

156
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:44,720
I can also tell you clearly

157
00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:49,830
that you're absorbing poisonous air while breathing.

158
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:55,270
If you use your true spirit, you will die faster.

159
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:56,620
Ji Ruochen.

160
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:59,870
I have sealed the whole tower.

161
00:12:00,950 --> 00:12:02,380
If you want to come out,

162
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:04,480
you can only use your true spirit.

163
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:08,190
It's just a matter of an early death or a late death.

164
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:10,810
It's up to you.

165
00:12:13,690 --> 00:12:14,160
Retreat.

166
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:20,990
What should we do?

167
00:12:23,090 --> 00:12:24,990
Yinyin, you can't use your true spirit.

168
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:26,820
This will make the poisonous air take its toll.

169
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:28,590
What should we do then?

170
00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:30,210
We just stay here and wait for death?

171
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:33,040
Let's think of other ways.

172
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,040
Qingyi.

173
00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:39,340
Don't waste your strength.

174
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:42,150
This is a divine chain. Monster power is useless.

175
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:43,540
I have to try even though it's useless.

176
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:45,380
We are here to help.

177
00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:47,730
Are we just going to wait for Mr. Ji and Yinyin

178
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:49,150
to save us

179
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:50,500
after they defeat that hypocritical banished god?

180
00:12:58,190 --> 00:12:58,990
Fairy Gu.

181
00:12:59,190 --> 00:13:01,160
I thought you would continue to pretend that you can't hear me.

182
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:01,900
Qingyi.

183
00:13:02,310 --> 00:13:03,990
Don't irritate Bluestone God.

184
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:07,720
Are you here to help Ruochen destroy spiritual caves?

185
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:09,660
Destroy spiritual caves?

186
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:11,520
Uncle said

187
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:13,350
Mr. Ji and Yinyin would be in danger.

188
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:14,990
I'm just here to save them.

189
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:17,200
I can't persuade Ruochen myself.

190
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,120
Maybe she can.

191
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,670
Qingyi. I don't know why Xixuan Sect

192
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,070
wants to destroy all the spiritual caves in the world.

193
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:29,030
Under their order,

194
00:13:29,190 --> 00:13:30,670
Ruochen has destroyed the spiritual cave in the Sand Sea.

195
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:32,480
He's in the fortress now.

196
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:35,410
I'm going to let you go. You go talk to him.

197
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:37,150
Tell him to turn back.

198
00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:41,040
Fairy Gu, from your tone,

199
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:43,270
you think what Mr. Ji did is wrong?

200
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:44,620
Although you are a monster,

201
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:46,230
you know what kind of disaster

202
00:13:46,370 --> 00:13:48,200
the destruction of spiritual caves will bring to the Three Realms.

203
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:49,910
Isn't that wrong?

204
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:52,720
I believe Mr. Ji

205
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:54,030
and Yinyin.

206
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:55,300
They will never do bad things.

207
00:13:55,510 --> 00:13:57,350
But he did destroy the spiritual cave.

208
00:13:57,350 --> 00:13:58,320
Everyone knows it.

209
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:00,950
That's why Imperial Advisor built a formation here

210
00:14:00,950 --> 00:14:01,920
to protect the spiritual cave.

211
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:04,710
He used a sinister formation called the Tianxuan Altar.

212
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:05,760
Fairy Gu,

213
00:14:05,830 --> 00:14:07,950
you are more naive and easier to be fooled than me.

214
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,790
The formation is protected and guided by the divine power of Yinfeng.

215
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:11,710
How could it be sinister?

216
00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:14,070
He hates Mr. Ji so much.

217
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:15,860
If I were him, I would seize the chance to...

218
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:18,670
Fairy Gu.

219
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:20,550
She has been trapped here for a long time.

220
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:21,350
She's not thinking straight.

221
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:22,560
Don't mind her.

222
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:24,430
Let us go first.

223
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:26,880
Then we can meet Mr. Ji

224
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:29,370
and see if he really wants to destroy spiritual caves.

225
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:30,420
If it's true,

226
00:14:30,710 --> 00:14:32,560
we can try our best to stop him.

227
00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:33,410
That's right.

228
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:34,950
We are trapped here.

229
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:37,350
We can't persuade him even if we want to.

230
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:38,910
If we don't go to him in time,

231
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:41,850
Mr. Ji might have been killed by Yinfeng.

232
00:14:41,890 --> 00:14:42,550
Yes.

233
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:44,590
Yinfeng said he would spare Ruochen's life.

234
00:14:44,890 --> 00:14:46,610
Fairy Gu, let us go.

235
00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:47,900
If we can persuade him,

236
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:49,320
maybe Mr. Ji doesn't have to

237
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,370
fight with Yinfeng.

238
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:01,470
Let's go.

239
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:02,760
Wait.

240
00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:05,270
I have something to tell you.

241
00:15:07,830 --> 00:15:08,880
It's me. Ling.

242
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:10,430
I'm going to break the restriction of the spiritual power.

243
00:15:10,530 --> 00:15:12,210
Ling, you can't use your true spirit.

244
00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:13,270
Otherwise, you'll die.

245
00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:14,950
My master created me with monster arts.

246
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:16,910
The poisonous air can't do anything to me.

247
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,110
You are indeed a reliable friend.

248
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:32,780
Let's get out of here first.

249
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,510
Let's go find Qingyi and Senior Qiushui first.

250
00:15:55,890 --> 00:15:57,130
We'll talk about other things later.

251
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:08,730
Yinyin.

252
00:16:09,070 --> 00:16:09,620
Yinyin.

253
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:12,670
Ling was right.

254
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:14,370
If I still won't let go,

255
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,710
I'll only hurt Yinyin again and again.

256
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:18,760
Yinyin, are you okay?

257
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:19,390
I'm sorry, Yinyin.

258
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:21,840
I don't want you to get hurt again.

259
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:23,350
Let's go then.

260
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:24,430
Thank you.

261
00:16:37,950 --> 00:16:38,560
Yinyin.

262
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:39,390
Mr. Ji.

263
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:39,900
Qingyi.

264
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:41,350
-Qingyi.
-Qingyi.

265
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:45,400
You...

266
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:49,360
These are the bodhi leaves from the Endless Sea.

267
00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:50,540
It should be able to suppress the poisonous fog.

268
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:51,510
Eat them.

269
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:55,840
Thank you.

270
00:16:58,870 --> 00:16:59,300
Thank you.

271
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,640
Qingyi, what took you so long?

272
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,230
We were taken by someone to a place outside the city.

273
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:14,819
Fairy Gu helped us.

274
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:17,160
Gu Qing looks innocent.

275
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:18,900
But she is still on the side of Sun Guo.

276
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:20,380
Mr. Ji.

277
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:22,190
Fairy Gu asked me to tell you this.

278
00:17:22,650 --> 00:17:24,930
If you don't turn back and continue to destroy spiritual caves,

279
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,550
she won't show mercy.

280
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:28,040
But in my opinion,

281
00:17:28,349 --> 00:17:30,470
she doesn't really want to kill you.

282
00:17:30,930 --> 00:17:32,050
Because she also told me

283
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:33,790
the way to escape from the Tianxuan Altar.

284
00:17:34,030 --> 00:17:36,400
It's located in the stone alley in the south.

285
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:37,740
The barrier there is the weakest.

286
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,270
Ruochen, what should we do?

287
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:41,990
Let's find a place to rest

288
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,510
and detoxify ourselves first.

289
00:17:47,390 --> 00:17:47,840
Yinyin.

290
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:48,880
Let's go.

291
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:49,790
Let's go.

292
00:18:03,050 --> 00:18:04,930
Qing, you let them go?

293
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:05,900
Yes.

294
00:18:07,130 --> 00:18:08,010
Do you know if you let them go,

295
00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:09,910
Ji Ruochen will escape?

296
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:12,720
He can't destroy the spiritual cave if he escapes.

297
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,110
Isn't that perfect?

298
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:18,230
Qing, you are laying by trouble for the future.

299
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:25,510
Yinfeng, please calm down.

300
00:18:26,390 --> 00:18:29,040
Fairy Gu is just kind-hearted.

301
00:18:29,810 --> 00:18:34,780
Besides, she almost married Ji Ruochen.

302
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:37,990
It's understandable that she can't make up her mind now.

303
00:18:38,510 --> 00:18:40,110
We should think about

304
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:41,530
how to save the formation.

305
00:18:45,550 --> 00:18:48,110
If Ji Ruochen finds the core of the formation,

306
00:18:48,110 --> 00:18:49,130
it'll be troublesome.

307
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:51,080
All our efforts

308
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:53,900
and your divine power will be in vain.

309
00:18:55,630 --> 00:18:57,390
Then kill him

310
00:18:58,190 --> 00:18:59,440
before he finds it out.

311
00:19:14,870 --> 00:19:15,560
Mr. Ji,

312
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:18,620
do you have something to tell me in private?

313
00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:20,790
Yes.

314
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:25,240
I hope you can take good care of Yinyin for me.

315
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:28,350
Have you figured it out?

316
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:30,590
No.

317
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:34,390
I don't want Yinyin to suffer anymore.

318
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,120
And you have strong power.

319
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:40,160
I believe you can take good care of Yinyin.

320
00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:44,870
My master created me with monster arts.

321
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:46,710
I don't understand human's feelings.

322
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:47,950
So

323
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,290
I don't know if I can take good care of Yinyin.

324
00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:52,470
I trust you.

325
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:54,930
Yinyin trusts you too.

326
00:20:01,670 --> 00:20:04,580
All this time,

327
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:07,040
I've obeyed no one except Master.

328
00:20:08,190 --> 00:20:10,910
But Yinyin...

329
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:16,310
Yinyin is Qingyi's sister.

330
00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:18,620
I will take good care of Yinyin.

331
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:39,900
Let's go find the way out.

332
00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:41,770
Wait for me outside the formation

333
00:20:41,890 --> 00:20:43,250
and attract Sun Guo's attention

334
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:44,910
to buy me more time.

335
00:20:45,430 --> 00:20:46,560
I'll come back after I destroy the spiritual cave.

336
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:47,710
Even so,

337
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:49,450
you need a helper.

338
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:51,020
I'll stay too.

339
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:53,110
Of course I'm the most suitable person.

340
00:20:55,770 --> 00:20:56,720
Fairy Gu.

341
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:57,480
Fairy Gu.

342
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:00,970
At least I can fool Sun Guo and his men

343
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:02,390
and hold Yinfeng back

344
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:05,890
to buy some time for Junior Ji.

345
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:07,170
Last time,

346
00:21:07,190 --> 00:21:08,670
Yinfeng already saw through your little ruse.

347
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:10,480
Since Master gave me

348
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:11,110
the mission,

349
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:12,860
you should listen to me.

350
00:21:16,530 --> 00:21:17,370
Then go by yourself.

351
00:21:17,430 --> 00:21:17,950
Let's go.

352
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:20,510
Yinyin.

353
00:21:20,630 --> 00:21:21,130
Yinyin.

354
00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:21,990
Yinyin.

355
00:21:22,590 --> 00:21:23,090
Yinyin.

356
00:21:23,910 --> 00:21:24,670
Junior Ruochen,

357
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:26,530
we will wait for you by the stream outside the mountain.

358
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:28,560
Remember, don't fight too long with them.

359
00:21:29,870 --> 00:21:32,070
Ruochen, you must be careful.

360
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:00,620
Let's go.

361
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:17,600
The power here is the weakest.

362
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:19,580
It should be the way out.

363
00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:21,070
You two,

364
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,150
take out your Dragon and Tiger Universal Cannon.

365
00:22:23,870 --> 00:22:24,300
Okay.

366
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:30,840
Everyone,

367
00:22:31,030 --> 00:22:32,640
we haven't fully recovered yet.

368
00:22:32,930 --> 00:22:34,070
Now we can only open

369
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:35,070
a hole for one person.

370
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:36,500
And it can't be maintained for long.

371
00:22:36,970 --> 00:22:38,110
You'd better move fast.

372
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,000
Go!

373
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:45,780
Go.

374
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:50,280
Where are Ling and Yinyin?

375
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:53,020
I can't let Junior Ji find out.

376
00:22:53,510 --> 00:22:54,430
Otherwise, he'll scold me again.

377
00:22:58,450 --> 00:22:59,130
Junior.

378
00:22:59,870 --> 00:23:01,200
You know this place is very dangerous.

379
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:02,200
Why do you have to stay?

380
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:05,650
I stay to help you destroy the spiritual cave.

381
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:07,550
But you haven’t recovered.

382
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:09,240
Can you stop forcing yourself?

383
00:23:09,490 --> 00:23:09,770
I...

384
00:23:10,610 --> 00:23:11,030
Yinyin.

385
00:23:12,130 --> 00:23:13,720
Ling, you came at the right time.

386
00:23:14,150 --> 00:23:14,800
With Ling here,

387
00:23:14,910 --> 00:23:16,470
there is a bigger chance for us to destroy the spiritual cave.

388
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:19,140
I'm just here to protect you.

389
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:20,850
I can't get involved in the destruction of the spiritual cave.

390
00:23:22,290 --> 00:23:23,180
Ling is from the Endless Sea.

391
00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:25,590
He only listens to the owner of the Endless Sea.

392
00:23:26,150 --> 00:23:26,910
He is taking care of you

393
00:23:27,210 --> 00:23:28,670
because you are a friend.

394
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:30,570
Don't force him.

395
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:33,950
If you want to stay, it's fine.

396
00:23:34,590 --> 00:23:35,790
Just wait for me here.

397
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:38,250
Please take good care of Yinyin.

398
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:44,660
Why is he so strange?

399
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:46,500
I stay because I want to help him.

400
00:23:46,950 --> 00:23:47,870
Why is he so mad?

401
00:23:48,430 --> 00:23:49,320
Let's follow him.

402
00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:07,090
Let's split up.

403
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:08,470
I'll go find Qiushui and Shi Ji.

404
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:10,170
Senior, I'll go with you.

405
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:22,120
Ling. You must protect Mr. Ji and Yinyin.

406
00:24:23,310 --> 00:24:23,820
Let's go.

407
00:24:24,550 --> 00:24:25,130
Qingyi.

408
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:28,950
Qiushui. Shi Ji. Are you okay?

409
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:30,230
We're fine.

410
00:24:30,870 --> 00:24:32,060
Sun Guo and the others are nearby.

411
00:24:32,670 --> 00:24:34,280
My wife and I are no match for them.

412
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,040
We must get out of here now.

413
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:38,700
Xuanzhen and his senior went to look for you.

414
00:24:40,550 --> 00:24:41,070
What?

415
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:43,000
They went towards the direction you just came from.

416
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:45,790
Oh no.

417
00:24:46,550 --> 00:24:48,590
Did they meet Sun Guo and his men?

418
00:24:49,150 --> 00:24:50,200
We have to help him.

419
00:24:50,350 --> 00:24:51,470
Honey, don't be impulsive.

420
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:52,610
You are injured.

421
00:24:53,330 --> 00:24:55,650
And we got more wounds

422
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:56,750
in order to get rid of Sun Guo and the others.

423
00:24:57,010 --> 00:24:58,120
The most important thing now

424
00:24:58,510 --> 00:24:59,870
is to find a place to heal

425
00:25:00,210 --> 00:25:01,170
and discuss it later.

426
00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:01,640
This...

427
00:25:04,490 --> 00:25:05,300
Let's go. This...

428
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:15,710
I knew you wouldn't leave.

429
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:19,140
Ruochen, why do you have to go against the world?

430
00:25:19,910 --> 00:25:20,750
I'm really grateful

431
00:25:21,610 --> 00:25:23,160
that you told me the way out of the formation.

432
00:25:23,870 --> 00:25:24,870
But now I don't have time

433
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:26,020
to discuss what is right and wrong with you.

434
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:27,770
I hope you can let me go.

435
00:25:27,790 --> 00:25:28,590
Of course it's wrong.

436
00:25:29,150 --> 00:25:30,030
Don't you know

437
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:32,260
how many disasters will be caused by destroying spiritual caves?

438
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,870
You know I don't want to draw my sword against you.

439
00:25:38,410 --> 00:25:39,620
But if you insist,

440
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:41,640
I have no choice.

441
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:44,050
Xixuan Sect always cares about people.

442
00:25:44,270 --> 00:25:46,040
It has never done anything evil.

443
00:25:46,590 --> 00:25:47,600
I believe in Master.

444
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:50,310
You are really unreasonable.

445
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,720
He said this is his master's order.

446
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:54,290
But you still want to stop him.

447
00:25:54,590 --> 00:25:56,390
You sound like you are doing this for my junior's good.

448
00:25:56,910 --> 00:25:58,670
Now you are talking about a master's order.

449
00:25:59,430 --> 00:26:01,810
Have you forgotten what you did

450
00:26:01,990 --> 00:26:03,530
when Ruochen followed his master's order to marry me?

451
00:26:03,890 --> 00:26:05,310
If you hadn't stopped us,

452
00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:07,630
Ruochen and I wouldn't have ended up like today.

453
00:26:08,950 --> 00:26:10,150
What marriage?

454
00:26:10,510 --> 00:26:11,550
Why would I stop you?

455
00:26:11,790 --> 00:26:12,190
You...

456
00:26:19,130 --> 00:26:19,670
Yinyin.

457
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:20,710
Yinyin.

458
00:26:21,510 --> 00:26:23,570
Ling. Please take her back first.

459
00:26:57,470 --> 00:26:58,070
Ruochen.

460
00:26:58,780 --> 00:27:00,460
Zhang Yinyin stopped us from getting married.

461
00:27:00,550 --> 00:27:01,500
And she pretended to have forgotten it just now.

462
00:27:01,910 --> 00:27:02,660
Are you sure

463
00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:04,280
that's the person you like?

464
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:05,120
Of course I am sure.

465
00:27:05,730 --> 00:27:07,410
When I first met her in the desert,

466
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:09,490
she was hot-tempered.

467
00:27:10,110 --> 00:27:11,110
She has poor memory.

468
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:12,850
She has many flaws.

469
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:15,340
But I like all her flaws.

470
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:16,480
No one can replace her.

471
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:19,600
And

472
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:21,790
Yinyin has forgotten it

473
00:27:21,790 --> 00:27:23,910
because she used her memories in exchange for Nuwa's tear.

474
00:27:24,250 --> 00:27:25,770
That's why I didn't become a useless person.

475
00:27:26,830 --> 00:27:28,150
Every time she remembers me,

476
00:27:28,470 --> 00:27:30,240
she has a headache and feels worse than death.

477
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:31,950
Every time she falls in love with me,

478
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:34,120
it makes her more painful.

479
00:27:35,270 --> 00:27:36,350
Even so,

480
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:37,980
she still follows me and stays with me.

481
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:39,890
The harder she tries to remember,

482
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:40,990
the more painful she will be.

483
00:27:42,410 --> 00:27:44,690
Can't you see what she did?

484
00:27:47,510 --> 00:27:51,590
You mean she did everything for you

485
00:27:52,350 --> 00:27:53,740
and has never asked for anything in return?

486
00:27:54,990 --> 00:27:57,310
Because of the bluestone,

487
00:27:58,150 --> 00:27:59,580
I have kept pestering you

488
00:27:59,870 --> 00:28:01,140
and even forced you to marry me.

489
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,600
So you hate me

490
00:28:05,630 --> 00:28:07,080
and you won't like me, right?

491
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:11,100
Fairy Gu.

492
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:15,870
In order to save me, you lost your dharma-laksana.

493
00:28:16,230 --> 00:28:17,070
You helped me get rid of demons

494
00:28:17,670 --> 00:28:19,790
and saved me in Mount Luoran.

495
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:22,670
I remember all of these.

496
00:28:23,150 --> 00:28:24,430
I'm very grateful.

497
00:28:24,590 --> 00:28:25,970
But you can only be grateful.

498
00:28:29,910 --> 00:28:31,560
You will never love me.

499
00:28:33,690 --> 00:28:34,460
You

500
00:28:36,270 --> 00:28:39,310
have no love tokens or romance in the previous life.

501
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:42,020
Even though she has forgotten and is painful,

502
00:28:43,830 --> 00:28:45,940
she still won't let go.

503
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:51,800
Maybe you are destined to be together.

504
00:28:57,190 --> 00:28:58,110
Fairy Gu, I'm sorry.

505
00:28:59,210 --> 00:29:01,230
I know you will stop me from destroying the spiritual cave.

506
00:29:02,590 --> 00:29:03,780
I have no choice.

507
00:29:20,110 --> 00:29:20,870
Where is Yinyin?

508
00:29:21,550 --> 00:29:22,510
Why aren't you with her?

509
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:24,470
Is she okay?

510
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:28,990
Although I don't understand human's feelings,

511
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:31,360
every time in danger,

512
00:29:32,010 --> 00:29:33,090
you care about her so much.

513
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:34,960
I can see

514
00:29:35,670 --> 00:29:37,430
you are the only one

515
00:29:37,430 --> 00:29:38,350
in this world

516
00:29:38,810 --> 00:29:39,360
who can protect her whole-heartedly.

517
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:42,990
But I'm also the one

518
00:29:43,470 --> 00:29:44,070
who makes her suffer.

519
00:29:45,970 --> 00:29:47,080
I'm not qualified.

520
00:29:57,510 --> 00:29:59,420
Why don't you stand in Yinyin's shoes?

521
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:02,950
Every time she remembers you, she feels so painful.

522
00:30:03,830 --> 00:30:04,950
But she can't help

523
00:30:05,430 --> 00:30:07,100
remembering again and again.

524
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:11,520
Only you can protect her.

525
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:14,020
Go.

526
00:30:15,140 --> 00:30:15,970
She's waiting for you.

527
00:30:19,030 --> 00:30:19,650
What about you?

528
00:30:20,830 --> 00:30:22,000
Are you going to leave?

529
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:24,140
I'm from the Endless Sea.

530
00:30:25,670 --> 00:30:26,730
I have my own mission.

531
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:34,000
Ling, thank you.

532
00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:03,070
Yinyin, are you okay?

533
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:06,430
Much better.

534
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,360
Fairy Gu said

535
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:10,750
I stopped you

536
00:31:11,310 --> 00:31:12,380
from marrying her.

537
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:13,580
What did she mean?

538
00:31:14,550 --> 00:31:15,560
She was talking nonsense.

539
00:31:16,030 --> 00:31:16,820
Don't believe her.

540
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:17,870
Nonsense?

541
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:19,130
Where are they?

542
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:22,220
They all left.

543
00:31:28,330 --> 00:31:30,870
Yinyin, from now on,

544
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:32,830
I won't drive you away again.

545
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:35,000
I won't leave you either.

546
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:40,720
Really?

547
00:31:44,610 --> 00:31:45,660
It's a deal then.

548
00:31:48,030 --> 00:31:50,110
But you must promise me

549
00:31:50,830 --> 00:31:51,630
you have to follow me closely.

550
00:31:53,890 --> 00:31:54,570
That's easy.

551
00:31:58,310 --> 00:32:00,030
Let's go find the spiritual cave.

552
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:20,040
We've searched the whole fortress.

553
00:32:20,830 --> 00:32:21,590
Why do I feel

554
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:22,890
the spiritual power here is the strongest?

555
00:32:23,310 --> 00:32:24,900
But we stayed here long.

556
00:32:25,350 --> 00:32:26,710
We didn't find the spiritual cave.

557
00:32:27,630 --> 00:32:28,490
Search carefully.

558
00:32:38,370 --> 00:32:39,040
It's here.

559
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:52,170
Why do I feel there's some evil energy inside?

560
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:53,790
Maybe it's because this is the bottom of the formation.

561
00:32:54,110 --> 00:32:54,910
Let's go in and take a look first.

562
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:22,750
I didn't expect Sun Guo to hide the bottom of the formation with power.

563
00:33:23,390 --> 00:33:24,710
But we still found it.

564
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:27,350
Let's destroy this spiritual cave now.

565
00:33:27,870 --> 00:33:28,470
Ji Ruochen.

566
00:33:34,650 --> 00:33:36,840
If you destroy a spiritual cave again, there's no turning back.

567
00:33:37,510 --> 00:33:38,590
You are a banished god.

568
00:33:38,990 --> 00:33:40,710
I can't believe you are helping a villain like Sun Guo.

569
00:33:41,650 --> 00:33:42,690
You even used your power

570
00:33:43,270 --> 00:33:44,420
to hide the bottom of the formation for him

571
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:46,580
at the sacrifice of the whole fortress.

572
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:48,450
You don't deserve to be a banished god.

573
00:33:48,790 --> 00:33:51,510
As long as I can protect the spiritual cave, the Three Realms will be safe.

574
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:54,320
A small fortress is nothing.

575
00:33:56,590 --> 00:34:00,030
Fine. Let's see if you can protect it.

576
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:57,720
Let's go.

577
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:06,690
Ji Ruochen, you can't escape.

578
00:35:21,150 --> 00:35:23,430
Ling. Mr. Ji and Yinyin succeeded.

579
00:35:23,490 --> 00:35:24,570
The spiritual cave has been destroyed.

580
00:35:25,750 --> 00:35:26,290
Qingyi.

581
00:35:26,870 --> 00:35:28,260
Mr. Ji and Yinyin succeeded.

582
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:29,420
The spiritual cave has been destroyed.

583
00:35:29,630 --> 00:35:30,640
Qingyi. Qingyi.

584
00:35:32,550 --> 00:35:33,470
The spiritual cave has been destroyed, right?

585
00:35:34,470 --> 00:35:34,900
Look.

586
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:35,590
There are so many.

587
00:35:35,590 --> 00:35:35,980
Great.

588
00:35:36,210 --> 00:35:37,370
Ruochen and Yinyin

589
00:35:37,650 --> 00:35:38,650
should be out soon.

590
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:48,570
But where are Xuanzhen

591
00:35:48,590 --> 00:35:49,590
and Senior Ji Bingxian?

592
00:35:49,970 --> 00:35:51,740
Considering Sun Guo and Lord Daran's capabilities,

593
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:53,620
it's difficult for them to trap Xuanzhen and his senior.

594
00:35:54,510 --> 00:35:55,370
I'm still worried.

595
00:35:56,510 --> 00:35:57,090
Let me ask.

596
00:35:59,230 --> 00:35:59,700
So sour.

597
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:02,730
Let me see. What else?

598
00:36:32,990 --> 00:36:34,110
It looks like

599
00:36:34,230 --> 00:36:35,910
your efforts will be in vain again.

600
00:36:36,150 --> 00:36:36,830
This is

601
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:40,210
what Qiushui said about being defeated repeatedly.

602
00:36:40,470 --> 00:36:40,840
No.

603
00:36:41,510 --> 00:36:43,710
This is called fighting on despite repeated setbacks.

604
00:36:45,470 --> 00:36:46,790
Imperial Advisor beat his brains.

605
00:36:46,790 --> 00:36:48,030
He also has Feng's help.

606
00:36:48,310 --> 00:36:50,070
I can't believe they were tricked by Ji Ruochen.

607
00:36:51,350 --> 00:36:51,910
Fine.

608
00:36:52,230 --> 00:36:53,150
If I kill you,

609
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:54,680
my trip here won't be in vain.

610
00:37:03,030 --> 00:37:03,630
Senior Bingxian.

611
00:37:03,630 --> 00:37:04,100
Stay away from me.

612
00:37:04,570 --> 00:37:05,360
This is the divine flame.

613
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:06,560
Neither you nor I can resist it.

614
00:37:06,710 --> 00:37:07,720
You saved me. If I don't help you,

615
00:37:07,750 --> 00:37:08,670
I'll be a very ungrateful person.

616
00:37:10,150 --> 00:37:11,800
If you surrender to me

617
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:13,640
and help me capture Ji Ruochen,

618
00:37:13,990 --> 00:37:15,480
I can let you go.

619
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:17,420
You are really as stupid as them.

620
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:18,680
You only know taking hostages.

621
00:37:46,670 --> 00:37:48,340
Looks like you're quite capable.

622
00:37:49,010 --> 00:37:50,410
Then try this again.

623
00:37:55,540 --> 00:37:56,110
Senior.
