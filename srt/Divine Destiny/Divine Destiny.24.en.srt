[Episode 24]

4
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:39,270
How dare you!

5
00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:41,000
Don't come back if you leave.

6
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,080
I'm so mad.

7
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:44,530
I can't beat him.

8
00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:46,380
-I agree.
-He's so arrogant.

9
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:48,380
Who brought the Deity Binding Rope?

10
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:49,479
Tie him up and send him on his way.

11
00:01:50,039 --> 00:01:50,710
Yinyin.

12
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:53,280
Let’s not use the phrase “send someone on one's way”.

13
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:53,979
It's so creepy.

14
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:56,390
If you are not afraid of death,

15
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:57,770
and insist on going,

16
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,130
there is a way.

17
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:00,720
What is it?

18
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,770
Why are you looking at me?

19
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:06,540
I'm the first one to be kicked out by him.

20
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:07,780
I have no choice.

21
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:09,090
He's just worried about you.

22
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:09,880
Tell me.

23
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:11,600
Are you willing to act according to the plan?

24
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:13,570
Tell me.

25
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:14,870
Come closer.

26
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,280
You got it?

27
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:25,210
Yes, I did.

28
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:26,940
But

29
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:29,920
are you hiding something from me?

30
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:33,670
Xuanzhen, tell me.

31
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:35,400
Did I know Junior Ji before?

32
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:38,220
If you don’t tell me, I’ll ask him myself.

33
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,260
Forget it.

34
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:40,370
In that case,

35
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:41,930
I'll tell you the truth.

36
00:02:42,079 --> 00:02:42,610
Darling.

37
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:49,030
Ji Ruochen

38
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:51,990
has always liked you secretly.

39
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:03,150
But he was too timid.

40
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:04,160
So

41
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:05,950
he didn't dare to express his feelings to you.

42
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:09,400
And he looks too ordinary.

43
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:11,360
Of course you won't notice him.

44
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:13,700
But if you tell him

45
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:16,000
that you like him a little,

46
00:03:16,329 --> 00:03:18,020
he won't let you go.

47
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,790
Although it sounds a bit ridiculous,

48
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:26,990
I'll try my best.

49
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:28,140
I'll give it a try.

50
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:31,210
Of course you can't go now.

51
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:33,320
It's very deliberate if you go to him now.

52
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,420
He won't believe you.

53
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:35,670
So,

54
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:38,940
you must choose a chance to spend time with him.

55
00:03:56,090 --> 00:03:57,100
Is it time now?

56
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:01,330
I'll go then.

57
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:09,620
Darling, will this really work?

58
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:10,830
Of course.

59
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,020
Now, Ji Ruochen only cares about

60
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:14,850
whether Yinyin can remember him.

61
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:38,500
You don't have to persuade me.

62
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:40,560
I've made up my mind.

63
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:46,380
I'm not here to persuade you.

64
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:48,720
I know how you feel.

65
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,920
I'm here to say goodbye.

66
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,040
I'm going back to Xixuan Mountains tomorrow.

67
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:06,630
Have you figured it out?

68
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:09,140
What about Qiushui and the others?

69
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:16,880
By sitting with you like this,

70
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,150
I feel familiar.

71
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:26,740
Really?

72
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:34,400
I was very sad when you kicked me out.

73
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:36,210
I started having a headache.

74
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:38,440
But strangely,

75
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:41,050
many images flashed in my head.

76
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:42,900
They were all related to you.

77
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:46,720
Have we...

78
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:49,100
Have we met before?

79
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:54,630
Yinyin.

80
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:58,280
Do you remember something?

81
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:01,290
He really likes me.

82
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:03,350
Keep up the good work, Zhang Yinyin.

83
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:07,620
We are of the same age and we are from the same sect.

84
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:11,510
Although Xixuan Mountains are huge and there're many sects there,

85
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:15,650
even if we haven't seen each other at the library, the training ground

86
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:16,810
or the Sword Forging Mountain,

87
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:18,590
we must have seen each other in annual exams. Right?

88
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:21,490
Yes.

89
00:06:23,170 --> 00:06:24,120
We met before.

90
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:26,850
Were you there in Haofang

91
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:29,030
when we eliminated the demons?

92
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:33,490
Of course I was.

93
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:37,640
Do you really remember something?

94
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:41,659
I always feel like I've seen you in Haofang.

95
00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:54,550
Yinyin, do you really remember

96
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:55,490
something?

97
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:59,390
Well, he begins to take advantage of me.

98
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,650
He really takes an inch and goes for a foot.

99
00:07:02,970 --> 00:07:04,010
Forget it, Zhang Yinyin.

100
00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:06,450
Hold it. If you can't bear it, you'll ruin your plan.

101
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:09,770
I'm not sure.

102
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:14,520
I just vaguely remember something.

103
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:17,470
I think we were very close.

104
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:21,500
Even if she recognizes you,

105
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:23,380
once she falls in love with you,

106
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:25,470
she will forget you again.

107
00:07:26,130 --> 00:07:30,070
And the deeper she loves you, the more thoroughly she will forget you.

108
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:34,680
Junior,

109
00:07:35,090 --> 00:07:38,060
don't drive me back to Xixuan Mountains.

110
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,090
Take me to destroy the spiritual cave.

111
00:07:40,570 --> 00:07:42,690
The longer I stay with you,

112
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:45,550
the more I might be able to remember.

113
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:56,990
Yinyin.

114
00:07:58,270 --> 00:07:59,060
Tell me.

115
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:02,870
Who taught you to pretend to remember something?

116
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:08,430
You don't believe me?

117
00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:10,690
You don't like me anymore?

118
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:12,690
Was it Qiusui and the others?

119
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:15,930
Was it?

120
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:22,950
Xuanzhen, Qiushui.

121
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:24,330
Come out.

122
00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:30,940
I know you want to stay to help me,

123
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:32,559
but I've made up my mind.

124
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:33,710
That's it.

125
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:35,400
You don't know what's good for you.

126
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:37,500
If you want to be a hero, do whatever you want.

127
00:08:37,530 --> 00:08:38,570
I'll return to Xixuan tomorrow.

128
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:39,970
Really?

129
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:41,909
Then, Senior Qiushui and Senior Xuanzhen,

130
00:08:41,929 --> 00:08:43,840
please send her back.

131
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:45,280
Yinyin.

132
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:47,240
You are giving up halfway.

133
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:48,790
I won’t kneel and beg.

134
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:50,610
I don’t need them to send me back. I’ll go back myself.

135
00:08:57,780 --> 00:08:58,240
How about this?

136
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,250
I'll send her back to Xixuan Mountains.

137
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:03,640
But I have a request.

138
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:07,070
What is it?

139
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:10,300
Take my husband and others with you.

140
00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:11,660
They are not poisoned.

141
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,600
Now you have no reason to refuse.

142
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:16,700
Darling, you really understand me.

143
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:18,910
Please send Yinyin back to Xixuan first.

144
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:22,170
It's settled then.

145
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:23,770
After I destroy the spiritual cave,

146
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:25,020
we'll meet at Xixuan Mountain.

147
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:26,430
What meeting?

148
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:27,630
You treat me like this.

149
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:29,100
Let’s forget each other.

150
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,160
Yinyin, Yinyin.

151
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,050
Take good care of my husband.

152
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:40,840
If my husband gets hurt again,

153
00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:42,100
I'll be really angry.

154
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:43,540
It won't happen, Darling.

155
00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:45,220
I’ll go accompany Yinyin.

156
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:50,190
Come here. I have something to tell you.

157
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:57,000
Ruochen, we'll be apart tomorrow.

158
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,610
Are you really not going to talk to Yinyin?

159
00:10:01,490 --> 00:10:04,370
Forget it. I don't want to upset her more.

160
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:06,480
Ruochen.

161
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:27,650
I know you hate me.

162
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:30,140
But I don’t want you to be in danger.

163
00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:39,600
The nearest spiritual cave

164
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:40,550
is in the fortress.

165
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:41,820
Let’s go now.

166
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:46,470
What's wrong, Ruochen?

167
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:50,960
Why do I feel that there're someone else

168
00:10:51,070 --> 00:10:52,150
other than us?

169
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:54,030
Someone else?

170
00:11:03,210 --> 00:11:06,640
Junior Ji, you're really capable.

171
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:09,080
You even saw through my Heavenly Fox Secret Technique.

172
00:11:09,430 --> 00:11:11,240
No wonder Master asked you

173
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:12,200
to destroy the spirit cave.

174
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:15,080
Didn't you promise to go back to Xixuan Mountains?

175
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:16,430
I lied to you.

176
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:18,710
How can I not join in

177
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,120
such an interesting task?

178
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:21,350
Junior,

179
00:11:21,770 --> 00:11:23,260
if you don't want to bring me with you,

180
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:24,690
it's okay.

181
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:26,460
Anyway, I've memorized all the spiritual caves

182
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:27,360
on the map.

183
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:28,430
I can go by myself.

184
00:11:28,850 --> 00:11:30,490
Zhang Yinyin, you don’t keep your word.

185
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:32,120
What did you call me?

186
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:33,380
Call me Senior.

187
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:34,730
Where are your manners?

188
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:35,820
Will you bring me along?

189
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:44,680
I will.

190
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:46,340
Let's go.

191
00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:52,630
Ji... Ji...

192
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:53,960
Wait for me!

193
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:58,280
-What’s your name?
-She can’t even remember his name.

194
00:11:58,730 --> 00:12:00,340
But she's still tagging along with him.

195
00:12:01,010 --> 00:12:02,070
It's really heartbreaking.

196
00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:05,890
All disciples, listen.

197
00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:06,520
Yes.

198
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:09,280
You go to the eight directions of the fortress.

199
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:10,950
Help me set the Tianxuan Altar Formation.

200
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:14,470
The rest of you go to ambush near the Drum Tower

201
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:15,430
and wait for my orders.

202
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:16,080
Yes.

203
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:17,690
I want to turn this place

204
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:20,860
into Ji Ruochen’s grave.

205
00:12:21,890 --> 00:12:24,180
[Fortress]

206
00:12:41,290 --> 00:12:43,250
According to Shenzhou Energy Map,

207
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:46,540
the spiritual cave is near the village.

208
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:48,340
But why can’t I feel

209
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:49,200
any spiritual energy?

210
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:51,660
Don't you think it's weird here?

211
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:53,260
There's no one here.

212
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:53,900
Yeah.

213
00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:57,610
I think this place is quite spooky.

214
00:12:57,730 --> 00:12:58,670
It's just a little foggy.

215
00:12:58,740 --> 00:12:59,900
Don't scare yourselves.

216
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,350
Senior, you're wrong.

217
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,160
Our sect is good at observing stars.

218
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:07,490
Tonight is the day when there will be Seven-Star Combination.

219
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:09,160
The location of this fortress

220
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,450
is precisely the place where the stars shine most brightly.

221
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:13,790
That's why it's more spooky.

222
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:15,960
No wonder.

223
00:13:16,290 --> 00:13:19,700
On a full moon night with a Seven-Star Combination,

224
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:22,410
when time and space are misaligned,

225
00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:26,720
people who get involved will have a chance to turn back time.

226
00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:31,770
However, this chance will pass soon.

227
00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:36,200
If you miss it, you'll have to wait another 100 years.

228
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:37,400
Yinyin.

229
00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:40,930
Is this our last chance?

230
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:42,910
Junior, what's wrong?

231
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:46,010
Nothing.

232
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:47,980
Let's search the fortress

233
00:13:48,170 --> 00:13:49,320
and see what's wrong.

234
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,780
Let's meet there.

235
00:13:56,610 --> 00:13:57,660
Yinyin, wait for me.

236
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:00,810
Imperial Advisor, once the Tianxuan Altar Formation is activated,

237
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:03,110
people in the fortress may die.

238
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:06,080
If the two immortals know about this...

239
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:09,770
If this spiritual cave is also destroyed by Xixuan Sect,

240
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:12,420
I'm afraid there will be no peace in the world.

241
00:14:12,930 --> 00:14:14,200
Compared to the world,

242
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:16,260
a small fortress is nothing.

243
00:14:17,510 --> 00:14:21,280
I’ve already tried to cover it up. No one knows it.

244
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:23,920
If there’s any more damage,

245
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:27,600
we’ll have to make the people in the fortress suffer.

246
00:14:29,890 --> 00:14:30,990
Start the ritual.

247
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:34,690
It's so quiet. It's not normal.

248
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:37,040
No one is guarding the gate.

249
00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:38,270
I'm afraid there's an ambush.

250
00:15:39,190 --> 00:15:40,070
We must be careful.

251
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:42,940
Ling, Uncle asked you to come with us.

252
00:15:42,970 --> 00:15:44,210
He really had foresight.

253
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:45,800
Follow me.

254
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:02,190
Barrier?

255
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:04,170
No wonder no one is guarding.

256
00:16:05,490 --> 00:16:08,120
Qingyi, do you know this barrier?

257
00:16:08,730 --> 00:16:10,300
I seem to have read it in a book.

258
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:13,470
This seems to be the Tianxuan Altar Formation of Zhenwu Temple.

259
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:14,450
It's extremely sinister.

260
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:15,730
That old scoundrel

261
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:17,900
is pretentious and evil.

262
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:18,540
Let me do it.

263
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:22,070
Are you okay?

264
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:23,580
I’m fine.

265
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:24,970
Don’t worry, Miss Qingyi.

266
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:26,100
Let’s have a look.

267
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:26,430
Let's go.

268
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:40,990
Awesome.

269
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,920
Let's go take a look.

270
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:46,010
Let's go.

271
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:08,859
Will Ji Ruochen really come?

272
00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:12,920
Are you afraid that he will come or are you afraid that he won't come?

273
00:17:17,819 --> 00:17:19,220
Is killing him

274
00:17:19,569 --> 00:17:20,430
really the only way?

275
00:17:21,579 --> 00:17:24,010
Qing, because you are soft-hearted,

276
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:26,119
the spiritual cave of the Sand Sea has been destroyed.

277
00:17:26,589 --> 00:17:27,660
Ji Ruochen has already become a demon.

278
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:30,910
It's too late for you to persuade him.

279
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:34,180
Are you really going to watch him harm the world

280
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:35,530
and torment the people?

281
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:46,680
If that's the case, there's really nothing we can do.

282
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:52,270
Ruochen, I hope you can turn back.

283
00:17:53,730 --> 00:17:54,490
Young Master.

284
00:17:56,650 --> 00:17:57,340
Sister.

285
00:17:58,730 --> 00:17:59,370
Young Master.

286
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:01,750
Qingyi, Ling.

287
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:02,770
Dragon Elephant, White Tiger.

288
00:18:04,030 --> 00:18:04,800
Why are you here?

289
00:18:05,090 --> 00:18:06,440
Uncle said you were in danger,

290
00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:07,510
so we came to help you.

291
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:08,370
You're really good friends.

292
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:11,230
You know we're here to destroy the spiritual cave.

293
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:12,240
It's dangerous here.

294
00:18:12,790 --> 00:18:13,630
You should go back.

295
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:15,610
We have to help even if there's danger.

296
00:18:16,910 --> 00:18:17,700
Right, Ling?

297
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:20,540
Ling is very skilled.

298
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:22,610
As long as he's here, the spiritual cave will definitely be destroyed.

299
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:24,730
But Master only asked me to protect you.

300
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:26,350
I can’t interfere in the matter of destroying the spiritual cave.

301
00:18:26,370 --> 00:18:27,020
Why?

302
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:28,570
It’s a great thing to destroy the spiritual cave.

303
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:29,510
You are so skilled.

304
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:30,550
-It’s a waste if you don’t go destroy the spiritual cave.
-That’s right.

305
00:18:30,570 --> 00:18:31,440
Master didn't order me to do that.

306
00:18:32,830 --> 00:18:34,400
All you know is your master.

307
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:35,940
Your master only asked you to protect Qingyi.

308
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:37,780
Will you protect me if I’m in danger?

309
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:39,140
Of course I will help you.

310
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:39,900
Look.

311
00:18:40,430 --> 00:18:41,750
You don't always listen to your master.

312
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:42,190
Yes.

313
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:43,650
So it's okay. Let me tell you.

314
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:44,800
Just do casually

315
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:46,510
what your master asked you to do, right?

316
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:47,660
Yes.

317
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:49,320
Even Qingyi understands it.

318
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:50,090
[Drum Tower]

319
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:51,020
You have to listen to me.

320
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:52,620
Don't be too stubborn.

321
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:55,170
-Do you understand?
-Sister, what’s wrong with Young Master?

322
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:02,620
He's been acting

323
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:03,370
strange lately.

324
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:05,140
Let’s go inside.

325
00:19:05,330 --> 00:19:06,340
-Let’s go in first.
-Let’s go.

326
00:19:18,350 --> 00:19:19,480
The fish has taken the bait.

327
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:21,550
High Immortal, please help me.

328
00:20:02,830 --> 00:20:05,450
Qing, Ji Ruochen is down there.

329
00:20:06,190 --> 00:20:07,100
Have you thought it through?

330
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:11,110
Imperial Advisor has set up the formation.

331
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:13,720
Let him handle it.

332
00:20:17,470 --> 00:20:20,540
Qing, it seems that you still can't act hard

333
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:21,500
on Ji Ruochen.

334
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:27,520
Let me think about it, okay?

335
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:31,590
I promise you.

336
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:35,000
As long as Ji Ruochen doesn't destroy the spiritual cave,

337
00:20:36,150 --> 00:20:37,140
I won't give him a hard time.

338
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:40,480
But if he continues to be stubborn,

339
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:45,910
Qing, I hope you can make a decision.

340
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:17,660
They are breaking our defense works.

341
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:19,650
Looks like they'll do it tonight.

342
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,600
They don't even dare to come here openly.

343
00:21:21,910 --> 00:21:23,390
They must be cowards.

344
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:26,230
Should we put up more talismans?

345
00:21:27,570 --> 00:21:28,050
No need.

346
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:30,540
They're going to be blown up anyway.

347
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:32,300
We just need to be careful.

348
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:34,260
We'll meet them sooner or later.

349
00:21:35,430 --> 00:21:35,880
Let's go back.

350
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:51,560
If Yinyin remembers the scene when we took shelter from the rain,

351
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:53,640
I'm afraid she'll have a headache again.

352
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:55,420
What are you waiting for?

353
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,440
Bring the umbrella here.

354
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:01,710
What's wrong with him? He's so weird.

355
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:04,160
Yinyin.

356
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:09,900
Thank you, Ling.

357
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:11,300
You're more reliable.

358
00:22:19,230 --> 00:22:21,420
What's wrong with that guy?

359
00:22:23,690 --> 00:22:24,410
Let's go back too.

360
00:22:42,210 --> 00:22:44,260
Why do I feel he is so familiar?

361
00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:50,520
Yinyin.

362
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:52,620
Why are you so absent-minded?

363
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:55,320
I was thinking about Junior Ji.

364
00:22:57,130 --> 00:22:58,260
You are so straightforward.

365
00:22:58,790 --> 00:23:00,150
What, Senior?

366
00:23:02,370 --> 00:23:03,840
I just think he's weird.

367
00:23:05,290 --> 00:23:06,520
When we were in the shabby temple,

368
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:08,050
I coaxed him as you said.

369
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:09,990
But he seemed very eager.

370
00:23:10,570 --> 00:23:11,930
He even asked me what I remembered.

371
00:23:13,450 --> 00:23:15,380
I was wondering what my relationship with him was.

372
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:18,190
Why did he say that?

373
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:24,170
Senior, did I really forget something?

374
00:23:28,550 --> 00:23:30,920
Shi Ji said he likes me.

375
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:33,210
Is it true or not?

376
00:23:34,630 --> 00:23:35,490
I don't know.

377
00:23:36,010 --> 00:23:36,840
He's outside.

378
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:38,060
Why don't you ask him yourself?

379
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:39,020
I...

380
00:23:50,850 --> 00:23:52,900
If it's true,

381
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:54,210
I'm not ready.

382
00:23:55,850 --> 00:23:58,030
Then let it be.

383
00:24:03,810 --> 00:24:06,500
Senior, speaking of letting it be,

384
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:08,340
Shui liked you then,

385
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:09,610
why didn't you like him?

386
00:24:10,230 --> 00:24:11,310
He has been chasing you for so long.

387
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:12,970
Even water can pierce through the stone.

388
00:24:16,470 --> 00:24:17,260
That's not the case.

389
00:24:18,010 --> 00:24:20,240
If I love him, I can let it be.

390
00:24:21,110 --> 00:24:22,030
But in my heart,

391
00:24:22,710 --> 00:24:24,540
he's just like Ruochen and Xuanzhen.

392
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:26,910
Even if we go on like that for 100 years,

393
00:24:27,230 --> 00:24:28,250
the result will be the same.

394
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:31,310
How do you feel

395
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:32,330
with Shui liking you?

396
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:33,660
Troublesome.

397
00:24:35,430 --> 00:24:36,160
Troublesome?

398
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:42,440
I don't think Junior Ji is troublesome.

399
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:47,000
If I can't figure it out,

400
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:48,960
I'm going to suffocate to death.

401
00:24:49,850 --> 00:24:50,890
You're seeking trouble yourself.

402
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:54,570
He has always liked you secretly.

403
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:57,410
But he was too timid.

404
00:24:58,110 --> 00:25:00,820
So he didn't dare to express his feelings to you.

405
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:04,530
It's brave to do something you know you can't do.

406
00:25:05,210 --> 00:25:05,840
Right, Senior?

407
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:09,040
That's your usual style.

408
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,210
I'm going out for some fresh air.

409
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:17,160
The person I like...

410
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:21,840
The one you hide here with extreme care.

411
00:25:33,970 --> 00:25:36,250
Junior Ji, it's still dawn.

412
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,590
Why are you guarding here already?

413
00:25:39,230 --> 00:25:40,910
Qiushui isn't back yet.

414
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:42,690
Compared to waiting inside,

415
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:45,150
it's the same to wait outside.

416
00:25:48,090 --> 00:25:49,160
So cold.

417
00:25:49,710 --> 00:25:51,660
Why don't I stop asking?

418
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:57,640
But if I don't ask, I won't accept it.

419
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:01,500
Senior Yinyin.

420
00:26:03,430 --> 00:26:05,000
Do you have something to ask me?

421
00:26:15,790 --> 00:26:16,850
Do you like me?

422
00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:26,540
Who told you that?

423
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:29,720
Shi Ji told me last time.

424
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:32,180
She said you’ve been secretly in love with me.

425
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,160
After my observation these days,

426
00:26:35,130 --> 00:26:36,680
I do think it's possible.

427
00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:39,600
They were just talking nonsense.

428
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:41,870
If I did anything

429
00:26:41,950 --> 00:26:42,990
that made you misunderstand,

430
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,350
I apologize.

431
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,680
I won't do it again.

432
00:26:48,670 --> 00:26:49,560
How is that possible?

433
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:51,280
I clearly remember that in Tianxin Cave...

434
00:27:03,410 --> 00:27:04,270
It didn't happen.

435
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:06,150
Stop thinking about it.

436
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:06,990
No.

437
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:12,460
Impossible.

438
00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:16,420
In Tianxin Cave,

439
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:19,870
it was you, right?

440
00:27:25,030 --> 00:27:25,640
Not me.

441
00:27:26,510 --> 00:27:27,680
You've had a bad headache recently.

442
00:27:28,170 --> 00:27:29,310
Stop thinking about these things.

443
00:27:31,290 --> 00:27:32,170
I clearly remember...

444
00:27:32,410 --> 00:27:33,810
Yinyin, you have a headache again?

445
00:27:34,050 --> 00:27:35,690
Come on. Let me help you get in and rest.

446
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:55,490
How is Yinyin?

447
00:27:56,140 --> 00:27:56,840
Is she okay?

448
00:27:58,890 --> 00:28:00,770
She'll be in so much pain whenever she thinks of you.

449
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:03,260
Why did you give her a chance to remember you?

450
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,240
If you stay away from her,

451
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:06,670
and she can't see you,

452
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:08,600
she won't have to

453
00:28:08,630 --> 00:28:09,480
suffer like this anymore.

454
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:12,700
The problem will be solved.

455
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:15,160
What do you think?

456
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:31,260
[Drum Tower]

457
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:44,690
The fish has taken the bait.

458
00:28:46,370 --> 00:28:47,800
It's our turn to show up.

459
00:28:50,130 --> 00:28:50,730
Let's go.

460
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:59,600
Banished God, Fairy Gu.

461
00:29:00,210 --> 00:29:02,130
The spiritual cave concerns the safety of the Three Realms.

462
00:29:02,510 --> 00:29:04,690
Please think it through as soon as possible.

463
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:07,000
I’ll wait for you in the Fortress.

464
00:29:18,470 --> 00:29:20,320
She'll be in so much pain whenever she thinks of you.

465
00:29:20,990 --> 00:29:22,810
Why did you give her a chance to remember you?

466
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:24,780
If you stay away from her,

467
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:26,210
and she can't see you,

468
00:29:27,010 --> 00:29:28,130
she won't have to

469
00:29:28,150 --> 00:29:28,990
suffer like this anymore.

470
00:29:31,010 --> 00:29:32,200
The problem will be solved.

471
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:34,720
What do you think?

472
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,110
Look, it's good.

473
00:30:22,370 --> 00:30:22,930
Yes.

474
00:30:22,950 --> 00:30:23,330
Right?

475
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,040
What is it?

476
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:28,170
[There's an ambush by the Luoran School. I've been attacked by hidden weapons. Be careful!]

477
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:30,080
Bad news. Ruochen was attacked by hidden weapons.

478
00:30:30,410 --> 00:30:31,280
We have to help him.

479
00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:34,360
Yinyin.

480
00:30:34,390 --> 00:30:34,700
Yinyin.

481
00:30:34,910 --> 00:30:35,620
Yinyin.

482
00:30:36,290 --> 00:30:37,820
Ling, she still has a headache.

483
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:38,670
Go protect her.

484
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:39,600
What about you?

485
00:30:39,630 --> 00:30:40,760
I have Dragon Elephant and White Tiger.

486
00:30:41,030 --> 00:30:41,950
Don't worry. We're here.

487
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:42,590
Yes.

488
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:44,030
Be careful.

489
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:44,940
I'll be back soon.

490
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:45,310
Okay.

491
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,480
Senior. Let’s go.

492
00:30:48,410 --> 00:30:49,130
-Take it away.
-Let’s go.

493
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:53,460
Why are you here?

494
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:54,580
Don't you have a headache?

495
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:55,270
Much better.

496
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:57,230
Coward, come out.

497
00:30:57,690 --> 00:30:59,260
What kind of hero are you if you keep hiding?

498
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:28,100
Yinyin, you are injured.

499
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:29,220
Take her away.

500
00:31:36,770 --> 00:31:37,430
Where are they?

501
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:41,320
Come, sit down.

502
00:31:44,330 --> 00:31:44,970
How are you?

503
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:48,100
These people poisoned the secret weapons.

504
00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:49,740
They are so cruel.

505
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:51,210
It's poisonous?

506
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:13,110
Hang in there.

507
00:32:14,030 --> 00:32:15,150
It hurts.

508
00:32:27,670 --> 00:32:29,410
You are really weird.

509
00:32:30,530 --> 00:32:31,850
You're always so uncertain.

510
00:32:33,550 --> 00:32:35,730
I'm sorry. I didn't protect you well.

511
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:39,450
I told you I don't need anyone to protect me.

512
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:41,390
It's done.

513
00:32:43,780 --> 00:32:44,410
Thank you.

514
00:32:48,650 --> 00:32:49,450
So weird.

515
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:52,780
The sound came from here.

516
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:54,350
Where is Young Master?

517
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:58,980
I thought Ji Ruochen

518
00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:00,250
found some powerful help.

519
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:02,340
It turns out you are just a few demons.

520
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:03,420
Miss Qingyi.

521
00:33:03,710 --> 00:33:04,590
Our Universal Cannon

522
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:06,060
was activated once when we entered the fortress.

523
00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:07,770
Now the true essence bullet can't come into being.

524
00:33:07,790 --> 00:33:08,350
Right.

525
00:33:09,950 --> 00:33:11,100
Step back. Let me do it.

526
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:13,720
Don't talk big.

527
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:15,160
If you know your place, get lost.

528
00:33:15,470 --> 00:33:17,350
Otherwise, don't blame my Hundun Whip for being blind.

529
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:23,600
Are you going to watch the two priests

530
00:33:23,630 --> 00:33:24,970
die on the spot?

531
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:30,380
Miss Qingyi, go!

532
00:33:30,730 --> 00:33:31,550
Leave us alone.

533
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:33,200
Save Mr. Ji first.

534
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:35,940
Miss Qingyi, don’t be fooled.

535
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:38,260
Little demon, if you hesitate any longer,

536
00:33:38,490 --> 00:33:39,880
they will die.

537
00:33:54,170 --> 00:33:54,920
Yinfeng,

538
00:33:55,290 --> 00:33:57,690
as a banished god, how can you help the evil?

539
00:33:58,070 --> 00:33:59,910
You helped Ji Ruochen destroy the spiritual cave.

540
00:34:00,070 --> 00:34:01,170
You're the one who helps the evil.

541
00:34:02,090 --> 00:34:03,790
I just abide by my duty as an immortal.

542
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:06,350
The duty of an immortal?

543
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:07,150
Let me ask you.

544
00:34:07,530 --> 00:34:09,290
Who killed the Bamboo Snake?

545
00:34:09,570 --> 00:34:11,820
Who stabbed Young Master after he was severely injured

546
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:12,909
by the Bamboo Snake?

547
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:14,030
It was you.

548
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:16,340
Everyone knows it was you,

549
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:18,230
a narrow-minded banished god.

550
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:20,969
Miss Qingyi. Enough.

551
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,639
Stop talking.

552
00:34:23,670 --> 00:34:26,150
Yinfeng, let go of me! Yinfeng!

553
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:28,580
She's just a lowly demon.

554
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:30,280
Please show mercy.

555
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:33,940
I'm here to protect the spirit cave.

556
00:34:34,469 --> 00:34:35,750
When Imperial Advisor captures Ji Ruochen,

557
00:34:36,290 --> 00:34:37,080
I will let her go.

558
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:43,580
Can the Imperial Advisor really protect the spiritual cave?

559
00:34:45,639 --> 00:34:46,389
You want to ask

560
00:34:46,949 --> 00:34:48,750
if this formation can trap Ji Ruochen, right?

561
00:34:50,429 --> 00:34:53,340
This formation is formed by the Imperial Advisor with the aid of my divine power.

562
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:54,840
Without reinforcements,

563
00:34:55,350 --> 00:34:56,670
Ji Ruochen can never escape.

564
00:34:57,630 --> 00:34:59,470
As for the spiritual cave, it's guarded by my divine power.

565
00:35:00,110 --> 00:35:00,950
Nothing will happen.

566
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,520
Qing, are you still hesitating

567
00:35:05,990 --> 00:35:07,180
at this point?

568
00:35:10,110 --> 00:35:11,390
The spiritual cave is still there.

569
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:12,950
Ruochen did nothing.

570
00:35:13,630 --> 00:35:15,310
I didn't see him do evil.

571
00:35:15,550 --> 00:35:16,660
So it's hard to make a conclusion.

572
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:18,630
I'm not hesitating.

573
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:22,070
So,

574
00:35:22,910 --> 00:35:25,780
Qing, you are doubting that I framed Ji Ruochen.

575
00:35:27,890 --> 00:35:30,200
Am I that kind of person in your heart?

576
00:35:32,670 --> 00:35:33,550
I'm not doubting you.

577
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:38,110
It's just Ruochen knew he wasn't the banished god

578
00:35:38,530 --> 00:35:39,760
and he may die in Haofang,

579
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:42,650
but he still went to face the calamity to eliminate the evil for the people.

580
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:45,420
So I don't want to believe that he would become a demon

581
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:46,940
and bring disaster to the mortal world.

582
00:35:51,530 --> 00:35:52,100
I know.

583
00:35:52,630 --> 00:35:54,880
Qing, do you remember what I said to Ji Ruochen

584
00:35:55,740 --> 00:35:57,280
by the Hao River that day?

585
00:35:58,780 --> 00:35:59,380
I admit

586
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:01,320
I wanted to kill him

587
00:36:01,650 --> 00:36:02,750
because of my selfishness.

588
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:04,900
But now,

589
00:36:05,340 --> 00:36:06,610
you know his identity.

590
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:09,310
You and I have recognized each other.

591
00:36:09,950 --> 00:36:11,200
I don't hate him anymore.

592
00:36:12,530 --> 00:36:15,450
But if he's going to be a demon and destroy the spiritual cave,

593
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:18,230
I won't sit by and watch.

594
00:36:21,390 --> 00:36:24,650
Maybe he was bewitched by someone.

595
00:36:28,030 --> 00:36:29,140
Ji Ruochen is in the fortress.

596
00:36:29,930 --> 00:36:30,880
We'll know soon

597
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:32,380
if he's innocent or not.

598
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:48,040
Why did he leave?

599
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:49,940
Fairy Gu!

600
00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:51,640
Fairy Gu!

601
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:54,450
Fairy Gu!

602
00:36:56,010 --> 00:36:57,420
Fairy Gu!

603
00:36:59,040 --> 00:36:59,670
Fairy Gu!

604
00:36:59,970 --> 00:37:02,100
I’m Qingyi. Let me go.

605
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:04,370
Fairy Gu.

606
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:07,590
I'll go check on Xuanzhen and others. Why aren't they back yet?

607
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:14,910
[Drum Tower]

608
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:25,040
Is the Seven-Star Combination really just a legend?

609
00:37:32,310 --> 00:37:33,480
How dare they come here?

610
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:35,620
Yinyin, you can’t go out again.

611
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:36,710
Get out of my way.

612
00:37:52,690 --> 00:37:53,410
I got it.
