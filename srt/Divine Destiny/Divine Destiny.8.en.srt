[Divine Destiny]

3
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:37,990
[Episode 8]

4
00:01:58,650 --> 00:01:59,039
Let's go.

5
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:00,130
What's the background of this man?

6
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:02,020
How come he could kill the Great Ancestor with one stab?

7
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,640
Ling from the Endless Sea.

8
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:06,990
Endless Sea?

9
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:09,419
You mean the Endless Sea created by the Great Heavenly Demon?

10
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,060
Are you the Honghuang Guards?

11
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:14,250
Greetings, my lady.

12
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:17,240
Qingyi.

13
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:18,400
So you're…

14
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:21,240
So the uncle you mentioned

15
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:22,620
is the master of the Endless Sea,

16
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:24,829
and the head of all monsters in Xuanhuang, right?

17
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:27,030
Miss Zhang. Mr. Ji.

18
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,350
Please don't blame me.

19
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,730
I sneaked out this time.

20
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,590
That's why I didn't reveal my own identity.

21
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:33,480
I...

22
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:36,020
Can I not go back?

23
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:36,840
Stop messing around.

24
00:02:37,079 --> 00:02:37,810
Go back with me now.

25
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:38,880
Don't you understand what she said?

26
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:40,570
Qingyi has said that she doesn't want to go back.

27
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:45,210
Calm down.

28
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:47,020
But we can't leave Qingyi alone.

29
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:48,579
I didn't say that we should leave her alone.

30
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:51,870
You're injured so severely like this.

31
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:52,760
Why don't you go back?

32
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:58,670
Miss Zhang.

33
00:02:59,280 --> 00:02:59,940
Mr. Ji.

34
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:02,580
I have to say goodbye to you here.

35
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:05,010
I really don't want to leave you.

36
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:06,920
If you don't want to leave us, just don't go.

37
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:09,670
Be quick to obey my command! Break!

38
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:18,820
They went that way.

39
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:19,690
Chase them!

40
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:22,800
Great!

41
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:24,380
Now I can go to Haofang

42
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,220
with both of you.

43
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:26,590
Let's go at once.

44
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:28,010
I'm worried that he'll realize what has happened later.

45
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:28,500
Let's go.

46
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:29,940
You mean that

47
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:33,710
Chaoxi and Jiyao were killed by Xixuan Sect's disciples?

48
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:34,600
Yes.

49
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:35,890
Your Majesty, please take a look.

50
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:37,780
On the bodies of the two generals,

51
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:39,540
there are the scars caused by the Grand Five-Element Sword Formation.

52
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:40,900
Pass my order.

53
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:43,430
Withdraw the enchantment boundary at the entrance of the Xiaohun Valley.

54
00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:44,440
But

55
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,060
once the Xiaohun Valley is opened,

56
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,210
I'm afraid some little monsters might be unaware of the reality

57
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:49,310
and accidentally enter it.

58
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:49,940
Ridiculous!

59
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,550
The Xixuan Sect repeatedly provoked us.

60
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,880
Now they've killed Chaoxi and Jihou, who are my two beloved generals.

61
00:03:56,329 --> 00:03:57,470
If I don't take revenge for them,

62
00:03:57,740 --> 00:03:58,829
how can I quell my anger?

63
00:03:59,280 --> 00:03:59,620
Yes!

64
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:01,340
However,

65
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:03,480
what about Miss Qingyi?

66
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,850
I was going to find her

67
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:09,140
and ask her how that man had been recently.

68
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:12,880
Currently, we need to take revenge for Jihou and Chaoxi,

69
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:14,570
so we have no choice but to sacrifice her.

70
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:15,690
Yes!

71
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,709
Xixuan Sect!

72
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:22,200
I'm irreconcilable with you guys!

73
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:24,090
What did you say?

74
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:26,000
Ji Ruochen is not dead?

75
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:26,550
Right.

76
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:28,520
By now, he has arrived at the outside area of Haofang.

77
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:30,000
What about the Great Ancestor?

78
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:31,560
It is said that he's dead.

79
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:32,640
He's dead?

80
00:04:32,659 --> 00:04:33,060
Yes.

81
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:34,270
Get out!

82
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:37,270
Imperial Advisor,

83
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:38,990
do you think Ji Ruochen will

84
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:40,590
come to take revenge on us?

85
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:41,880
Calm down, Your Highness.

86
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:44,180
When I released the Great Ancestor,

87
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:46,150
I didn't tell him who was behind it.

88
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:47,730
I don't think Ji Ruochen

89
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:50,220
will suspect you.

90
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:51,670
But now, Ji Ruochen

91
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:53,440
has arrived at the outside area of Haofang.

92
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:55,400
What should we do?

93
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:00,120
Since he has come,

94
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,090
let's make use of this current situation.

95
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:07,850
Then let's use him to eliminate the demons.

96
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:11,420
After that, we can kill him.

97
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:32,490
The arrow wound on your shoulder hasn't healed yet.

98
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:33,909
You'd better lie down.

99
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:46,850
But you saved me.

100
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:49,120
That's not right.

101
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:52,030
It was you who saved me.

102
00:05:56,010 --> 00:05:56,740
Don't misunderstand it.

103
00:05:58,130 --> 00:05:59,600
I'm staying here for something else.

104
00:06:07,890 --> 00:06:08,710
How could I misunderstand it?

105
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:11,390
Fairy Gu is staying here specially to take care of me.

106
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:16,400
Help!

107
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:17,740
Help!

108
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:19,940
Come and help me!

109
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:24,350
Why are you yelling?

110
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:25,890
Fairy, help!

111
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,770
There's a demon in the Hao River!

112
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,150
Help!

113
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,550
Help!

114
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:44,470
Help!

115
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:46,159
Help!

116
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,220
Thank you for saving my life.

117
00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:22,430
Go home now.

118
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,940
Thanks. Thanks.

119
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,020
It really scared me.

120
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:32,100
Previously, I already noticed that

121
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,690
there was some demonic energy lingering around here.

122
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:36,110
I didn't expect that something strange would happen today.

123
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:38,260
But it's a hundred miles away

124
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:39,240
from Haofang.

125
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:40,530
How come it was here?

126
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:42,930
Is it possible that the demonic energy drifted down the river

127
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:44,130
and arrived here?

128
00:07:47,670 --> 00:07:48,680
This is an important matter.

129
00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:50,010
I need to go to Haofang immediately

130
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,030
and inform all the people.

131
00:07:57,730 --> 00:07:59,550
You shouldn't have acted tough just now.

132
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:06,640
Don't worry about me, Fairy Gu.

133
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:08,940
Go to Haofang now.

134
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:16,160
I made this a few days ago.

135
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:18,190
It might help to heal your wound.

136
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:23,240
Goodbye.

137
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:34,880
Look, Miss Zhang.

138
00:08:34,970 --> 00:08:35,929
Is this fun?

139
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,210
This looks like you.

140
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,520
So this is a carriage of the mortal world?

141
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:47,710
Look!

142
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:57,110
I'm Xu Zekai.

143
00:08:57,210 --> 00:08:58,580
Greetings, Senior Ji and Senior Zhang.

144
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:00,620
I've long heard that you're about to arrive in Haofang,

145
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:01,880
and I've been waiting for you for several days.

146
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:03,130
Today, you're here finally.

147
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:05,550
When I was on the mountain,

148
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:06,790
Master Ziyang told me that

149
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:08,350
one of our disciples was in Haofang.

150
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:09,870
He must be talking about you, sir.

151
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:11,140
I'm flattered.

152
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:12,680
I've been a disciple of this sect for not so long.

153
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:14,820
I don't dare to let you call me sir.

154
00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:15,400
Thank you.

155
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,320
Alright. Don't keeping saying thank you.

156
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:18,760
What's the situation in Haofang now?

157
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,230
Not long ago,

158
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,810
His Highness held a banquet in his mansion.

159
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:23,230
When you arrive in Haofang,

160
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:24,630
he will hold the Demon-Exorcising Assembly

161
00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:26,270
so as to discuss with all the heroes and Taoist priests

162
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,760
about how to eliminate the Bamboo Snake.

163
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:32,060
Please.

164
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:45,930
Come on. Keep up.

165
00:09:57,770 --> 00:09:59,300
Xu, you...

166
00:09:59,530 --> 00:10:00,820
You're early today.

167
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:02,970
Come on. Let's have a drink. Come on.

168
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:03,530
Come on.

169
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:05,270
These two people are Priest Dragon Elephant

170
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,280
and Priest White Tiger from Mount Xingyun.

171
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:07,960
They are best at making Taoist instruments.

172
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:09,910
Priests, this is...

173
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:12,870
Since he is a young man brought by you,

174
00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:13,790
no need to say more.

175
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:16,030
We will take good care of him.

176
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:17,880
What you said makes sense.

177
00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:18,730
Xu,

178
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,870
didn't you say that

179
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:23,760
the Ultimate Banished God

180
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:24,660
had arrived in Haofang?

181
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:26,000
Why isn't he here yet?

182
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,140
I'm Ji Ruochen.

183
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,200
Greetings, Priest Dragon Elephant,

184
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,250
and Priest White Tiger.

185
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:35,980
The Ultimate Banished God?

186
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:38,210
I was wondering why Mr. Ji

187
00:10:38,410 --> 00:10:40,600
didn't have any magical weapon with him.

188
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:41,220
It turns out that...

189
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,430
His state of mind and cultivation

190
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:45,270
have reached the level of pointing directly to the true heart

191
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,900
without making use of external tools.

192
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:48,000
What you said makes sense.

193
00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:50,660
He looks handsome and graceful.

194
00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:51,170
That's right!

195
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:53,970
Since ancient times, heroes have often appeared from juveniles.

196
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,160
Since ancient times, juveniles have often appeared from heroes.

197
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,120
Come on!

198
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:57,110
Come on. Have a drink.

199
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:58,650
What kind of Taoist priests are you?

200
00:10:58,930 --> 00:11:01,010
I think you two are just two bootlickers.

201
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:02,810
Why did you say that?

202
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:04,460
Both of us have been

203
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:06,850
waiting for Mr. Ji here for a long time,

204
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:09,800
because we want you to lead us

205
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:11,470
to kill that demon,

206
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:14,030
and save all the people from danger.

207
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:15,940
What an ignorant boy.

208
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,870
You can save the people from danger?

209
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:20,630
Why don't you take a good look at yourself in the mirror?

210
00:11:20,770 --> 00:11:22,150
You're so arrogant!

211
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:23,630
The one who's talking

212
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:25,460
is Liu Yechuan, the eldest disciple of the Zhenwu Temple.

213
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:26,830
The two men beside him

214
00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:29,070
are Lord Daluo and Lord Daran.

215
00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:30,760
That is Master Huihai.

216
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:33,640
Nice to meet you all.

217
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:36,610
Have you eaten garlic and fallen into the toliet?

218
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,520
Your mouth stinks.

219
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,690
He's His Highness's follower, Ji Tianxia.

220
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:49,040
Ji Tianxia! How dare you insult Liu!

221
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:50,710
Do you want to die?

222
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:52,720
You

223
00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:54,560
specialize in biting thieves who climb over the walls.

224
00:11:55,170 --> 00:11:56,680
-What a good watchdog! -You...

225
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:01,230
His Highness is really generous and tolerant.

226
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:02,050
There are all kinds of people here.

227
00:12:03,130 --> 00:12:06,010
His Highness is here.

228
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:09,960
High Immortals,

229
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:12,550
nice to see you all.

230
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:18,230
You must be Mr. Ji Ruochen.

231
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:20,970
I'm Ji Ruochen. Greetings, Your Highness.

232
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:22,330
The Ultimate Banished God

233
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:23,920
is indeed extraordinary.

234
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:25,470
I'm really lucky

235
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,240
to meet you today.

236
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:30,810
High Immortals, please have a seat.

237
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:32,910
Please.

238
00:12:39,430 --> 00:12:40,150
Everyone,

239
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,710
as the saying goes, a distinction should be made between immortals and mortals.

240
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:45,270
I'm just a mortal.

241
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:48,430
I'm so lucky that I can get

242
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,370
help and respect from you all.

243
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:53,250
In today's banquet,

244
00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:54,210
firstly,

245
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:57,300
I'd like to thank you all for your help.

246
00:12:57,540 --> 00:12:57,990
Secondly,

247
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:02,820
I want to to welcome Ji Ruochen for his arrival.

248
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:04,280
Thirdly,

249
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:06,870
the Bamboo Snake is about to be born.

250
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:10,070
I wonder whether you have any good ideas.

251
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:11,250
Everyone,

252
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:12,600
it is suggested that

253
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:14,730
we should ask Ji to lead us, right?

254
00:13:15,010 --> 00:13:17,220
Then he should come up with an idea first.

255
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,000
What you said makes sense.

256
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:22,620
Come on, Mr. Ji.

257
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:25,350
Say something

258
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,430
to shock them.

259
00:13:29,070 --> 00:13:30,110
Your Highness has just said that

260
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:32,670
we've been summoned here to discuss the birth of the Bamboo Snake.

261
00:13:33,210 --> 00:13:34,150
But in my opinion,

262
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,080
before the Bamboo Snake is born,

263
00:13:36,290 --> 00:13:37,900
if we can find a way to prevent and control it

264
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:39,620
so that this demon can't be born,

265
00:13:40,450 --> 00:13:41,840
then we can ensure the safety of Haofang

266
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,440
and protect the people of Haofang

267
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:44,850
from the harm of the Bamboo Snake.

268
00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:50,420
The birth of the Bamboo Snake is the will of Heaven.

269
00:13:51,070 --> 00:13:52,650
How can we prevent and control it?

270
00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:55,610
My master once told me that

271
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,960
before the Demon of Dark Abyss was born,

272
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:00,030
he would build his lair underground,

273
00:14:00,810 --> 00:14:02,340
and hide for a while.

274
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:05,360
Recently, I've noticed that some demonic energy is spreading inside and outside the Haofang City.

275
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:06,870
That means

276
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:09,510
the Bamboo Snake has built its lair.

277
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:11,550
If we can find it in advance,

278
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:12,620
and figure out a way to set up the formation,

279
00:14:13,010 --> 00:14:15,530
then we can stop the Bamboo Snake from being born.

280
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:20,080
That's easy for you to say.

281
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,890
Can the formation to trap the Bamboo Snake

282
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:24,830
be set up so easily?

283
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:27,340
Besides,

284
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:29,440
where are we going to find

285
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:30,930
the lair of the Bamboo Snake?

286
00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:39,140
Search for it in the Hao River.

287
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:54,710
I'm Gu Qing from the Yunzhong Residence. Greetings, Your Highness.

288
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:58,520
So you're Gu Qing from the Yunzhong Residence.

289
00:14:58,950 --> 00:15:00,580
It's my honor to meet you.

290
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,570
Ruochen, I haven't seen you for a long time.

291
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:08,650
Greetings, Fairy Gu.

292
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:11,180
Why are you here?

293
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:14,020
I came to look for you.

294
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,400
Fairy Gu, you've just said that

295
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:21,880
we can search for the lair of the Bamboo Snake in the Hao River.

296
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:23,000
Not long ago,

297
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:24,200
there was also the phenomenon of

298
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,840
demonic energy spreading in the downstream of the Hao River.

299
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:27,810
Besides, the Hao River passed by Haofang.

300
00:15:28,130 --> 00:15:28,800
It shows that

301
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:30,180
the lair of the Bamboo Snake

302
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:31,360
must be in the Hao River.

303
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,790
The demonic energy went down the river,

304
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,950
which caused the abnormal phenomenon in the downstream.

305
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:38,720
Therefore, we just need to search for it along the flow of the river.

306
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:39,230
What's wrong?

307
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:40,100
I feel like grinding my teeth.

308
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:41,770
Then we can definitely find that demon's lair.

309
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:48,280
Why are you laughing?

310
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,710
It's really a good show.

311
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:56,010
As for setting up a formation to trap the Bamboo snake,

312
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:57,550
there's still a way.

313
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:00,440
In the Yunzhong Residence, we happen to have such an approach,

314
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:02,960
which can be used to seal that demon in the formation

315
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:04,450
so that it can't escape.

316
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,750
Look! Everyone, look!

317
00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:16,280
Who said that there was no way to prevent the demon?

318
00:16:16,590 --> 00:16:17,180
All these problem...

319
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:20,610
All these problems can be solved one by one, right?

320
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:21,990
What you saide makes sense.

321
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:25,110
Fairy Gu, you're really good at magical skils,

322
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,730
and are so smart.

323
00:16:28,270 --> 00:16:29,070
Thank you, Fairy Gu.

324
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,350
You don't have to thank me.

325
00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:35,630
What a perfect match they are!

326
00:16:35,650 --> 00:16:36,890
What you said makes sense.

327
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:40,040
They've been predestined to be a couple since a hundred lives ago.

328
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:40,470
Yes.

329
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:40,970
Okay.

330
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:42,180
Pass my order.

331
00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:46,490
-Appoint Ji Ruochen as the Vanguard of Haofang. -Miss Zhang.

332
00:16:46,830 --> 00:16:48,310
He'll lead the people to kill the Bamboo Snake.

333
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:51,550
I hope you can forget the past

334
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:54,400
and assist Mr. Ji.

335
00:16:55,870 --> 00:16:56,680
I don't dare to take up the post.

336
00:16:58,070 --> 00:16:59,400
Why not?

337
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,290
Mr. Ji, I'm at your disposal.

338
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,240
I'm at your disposal.

339
00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:07,869
Mr. Ji, I'm at your disposal.

340
00:17:16,599 --> 00:17:17,700
How could he do that?

341
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:21,240
-No man is loyal to love. -You feel like grinding your teeth, but why is it related to Mr. Ji?

342
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:24,040
I can't explain this to you with just a few words.

343
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:25,800
Are we leaving now?

344
00:17:27,069 --> 00:17:28,640
If we don't leave, do we just sit there without doing anything？

345
00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:29,520
Out of sight and out of mind.

346
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:30,150
Let's go.

347
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:36,400
Why should I leave?

348
00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:38,190
She should leave.

349
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:44,580
You're leaving so soon?

350
00:17:46,010 --> 00:17:47,130
I'm talking to you.

351
00:17:50,730 --> 00:17:52,410
Since you and Ruochen are fellows in the same sect,

352
00:17:52,430 --> 00:17:53,370
let me give you a piece of advice.

353
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:56,370
Practising Monster's Art can help you make progress faster indeed,

354
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:57,990
but it's not a decent way after all.

355
00:17:58,890 --> 00:18:00,930
If you can turn back soon, it might not be too late.

356
00:18:01,710 --> 00:18:02,540
Monster's Art?

357
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:04,050
What nonsense are you talking about?

358
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:05,360
Who is practicing Monster's Art?

359
00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:07,940
If you're not practicing Monster's Art,

360
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,000
why did you make the Demon Subduing Stone into a bracelet

361
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:10,880
and wear it?

362
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:14,700
Well...

363
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:16,370
You don't know much about it.

364
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,400
Ruochen and I

365
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:20,080
fell into some underground palace

366
00:18:20,530 --> 00:18:21,650
and experienced life and death together.

367
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:24,340
Then he collected these crystals for me

368
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:26,300
and made them into a bracelet for me

369
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:28,810
so as to commemorate the fact that we experienced hardships,

370
00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:30,470
life and death together.

371
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:34,510
You're incurable.

372
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:39,540
You want to hear something else?

373
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,200
Miss Zhang is not sick.

374
00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:43,640
Why does she need to be cured by medicine?

375
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:44,530
Besides,

376
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:47,030
you've just said that it's not a decent way to practise Monster's Art.

377
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:48,540
But according to the Cultivation Manual,

378
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,780
anyone with nine senses can become immortal through cultivation.

379
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:52,060
And in fact,

380
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,950
there are quite many monsters who have become immortals through cultivation.

381
00:18:54,390 --> 00:18:55,100
In that case,

382
00:18:55,230 --> 00:18:57,390
why isn't it not a decent way to practise Monster's Art?

383
00:18:58,280 --> 00:18:58,890
Right.

384
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:00,880
Fairy Gu, explain it.

385
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:05,940
So what if you can beat me with your argument?

386
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,250
I'm still the one who has been predestined to be with

387
00:19:08,670 --> 00:19:09,460
Ruochen since a hundred lives ago.

388
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:11,900
Stop!

389
00:19:14,510 --> 00:19:15,390
Why do you

390
00:19:15,490 --> 00:19:16,410
keep pestering me?

391
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:18,430
Last time, I lost to you in our competition of swordsmanship.

392
00:19:18,850 --> 00:19:19,660
But this time,

393
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:21,200
I won't lose to you again.

394
00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:21,970
Fairies.

395
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:23,410
Fairies.

396
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:24,950
I've been looking for you.

397
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:29,230
Mr. Ji!

398
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:30,990
Mr. Ji, come here.

399
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:38,720
-This... -Senior Ji.

400
00:19:38,990 --> 00:19:39,830
As soon as I entered this room,

401
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:41,070
Senior Zhang and Fairy Gu insisited that

402
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:42,390
I should explain the terrain of Haofang to them.

403
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:44,190
Therefore, I wasn't out there for a while.

404
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:47,880
I know what you want to ask.

405
00:19:48,150 --> 00:19:49,790
Don't worry. We didn't fight.

406
00:19:51,170 --> 00:19:52,200
Really?

407
00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:53,830
Am I that shallow?

408
00:19:55,730 --> 00:19:56,430
Besides,

409
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:58,710
why should we compare our swordsmanship?

410
00:19:59,290 --> 00:20:01,610
Haofang is in danger now.

411
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:02,720
If we want to compete,

412
00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:05,550
we should see which of us can find the Bamboo Snake's lair first.

413
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,680
Private grudges are not important.

414
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:11,000
Now, we should focus on the big picture.

415
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:14,480
Let's get down to business.

416
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:16,010
Just now, Zekai

417
00:20:16,050 --> 00:20:17,580
already explained Haofang's terrain to us.

418
00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:19,710
The Hao River flows from the west to the east,

419
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:20,880
and passes by the city of Haofang.

420
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,200
It finally flows into the Yellow River.

421
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,470
It joins the Jian River and the Yi River in the middle.

422
00:20:25,130 --> 00:20:27,010
I found the demonic energy at the downstream of the Hao River.

423
00:20:27,230 --> 00:20:28,280
Inside the city of Haofang,

424
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:29,590
there are traces of demonic energy

425
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:30,830
in the east and the west of the city.

426
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:31,890
These two places

427
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,480
are where the Hao River passes.

428
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:34,460
In the next few days,

429
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:35,800
we'll split up to take actions

430
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:37,520
and search for it in these several spots.

431
00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:38,870
I believe

432
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:41,230
we can find the traces of the Bamboo Snake soon.

433
00:20:42,630 --> 00:20:43,720
Let's search for it in the east of the city.

434
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:44,880
Then I'll be in charge of the west.

435
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:47,400
I'll wait for your news at the Hui Garden.

436
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:48,680
If you have any news, inform me by the Flying Crane at once.

437
00:20:48,810 --> 00:20:49,580
Then I'll inform others.

438
00:20:55,870 --> 00:20:57,580
Of course I'll team up with Senior Yin.

439
00:20:59,570 --> 00:21:00,650
You're smart enough.

440
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:03,640
There are already two people in that team.

441
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,120
You'll be a burden if you join them, won't you?

442
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:07,460
I'm the only member in my team.

443
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:09,030
Go with me to the west of the city.

444
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:10,190
On the way,

445
00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:11,880
I can teach you the secret of the formation to seal

446
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:12,590
the Bamboo Snake.

447
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,330
He has said that

448
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:15,840
he doesn't want to team up with you.

449
00:21:17,070 --> 00:21:18,670
Didn't we agree to focus on the big picture?

450
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:21,200
Is this how you focus on the big picture, Fairy Zhang?

451
00:21:21,610 --> 00:21:23,530
Members of the Xixuan Sect are really educated.

452
00:21:23,670 --> 00:21:24,840
If you want to criticize me, just do so.

453
00:21:24,870 --> 00:21:25,830
Why do you also talk about the Xixuan Sect?

454
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:27,430
Miss Zhang, don't be angry.

455
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:28,590
At worst, I won't go.

456
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:29,710
Then there will be only one person searching the east

457
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:30,580
and the west of the city respectively.

458
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:31,010
It'll be fair then.

459
00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:32,370
You should go. Why not?

460
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:34,210
Who are you going with?

461
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:39,480
I'll certainly…

462
00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:41,470
-Mr. Ji! -Mr. Ji!

463
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:42,960
You two are finally here.

464
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,660
We heard it just now.

465
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:48,460
Since there are traces of demonic energy in the east of the city,

466
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,040
there might be some of them outside the city, too.

467
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,440
Ji, why don't you go with us

468
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:54,410
to get out of the city along the eastern part of the city,

469
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,970
and see if there is any trace of demonic energy in the suburbs?

470
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:58,270
Great!

471
00:21:58,390 --> 00:21:59,100
-Okay. -No problem.

472
00:22:02,050 --> 00:22:02,820
What did you say?

473
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:06,690
Both the two women following Ji Ruochen

474
00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:08,170
are monsters?

475
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:16,710
Is there any misunderstanding?

476
00:22:17,050 --> 00:22:17,870
No.

477
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:24,330
I'm Li Zhiyao from the Liuxian Hall.

478
00:22:24,730 --> 00:22:25,610
Greetings, Imperial Advisor.

479
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:28,090
Those two women are monsters?

480
00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:29,520
It can't be wrong.

481
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:31,480
When we were on the Netherworld Mountain,

482
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:33,740
we saw one of them using Monster's Art.

483
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:36,080
And the other woman in a green dress

484
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:37,890
even summoned some monster generals to help her.

485
00:22:38,450 --> 00:22:39,530
Great Ancestor

486
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:41,900
was killed by these monster generals.

487
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:43,820
If my junior fellow disciple and I hadn't escaped fast,

488
00:22:44,870 --> 00:22:46,150
we would have been killed before we could

489
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:47,720
come here to seek refuge from you.

490
00:22:50,190 --> 00:22:52,240
Please take a rest first, gentlemen.

491
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:10,190
Alright.

492
00:23:11,430 --> 00:23:13,510
In the name of catching monsters,

493
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:17,420
I'll cause a big stir.

494
00:23:18,270 --> 00:23:20,020
When the righteous sects need to catch the monsters,

495
00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:22,590
Ji Ruochen will be so busy

496
00:23:22,590 --> 00:23:23,270
saving his two confidants.

497
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:26,320
I'm afraid he'll have no time to stop the Bamboo Snake from being born.

498
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:27,940
The Bamboo Snake must be born.

499
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:30,880
I must get the treasures

500
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:33,860
it carries.

501
00:23:53,710 --> 00:23:54,600
I didn't let you drink that much,

502
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:55,630
but you insisted on drinking so much.

503
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,030
But this is good, too,

504
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,000
At least, you didn't go far.

505
00:24:32,510 --> 00:24:33,870
I don't mean anything bad.

506
00:24:37,550 --> 00:24:39,120
Let me explain.

507
00:24:39,390 --> 00:24:40,470
Ruochen.

508
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:42,480
Don't go.

509
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:46,270
Is she still drunk?

510
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,170
I'm still here.

511
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:50,610
Then why are you so far away from me?

512
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:54,060
Help me up. Hurry up.

513
00:24:58,170 --> 00:24:59,330
Ruochen.

514
00:24:59,870 --> 00:25:01,330
Ruochen.

515
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,080
Stop crying.

516
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:06,880
I'm here, right?

517
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:09,630
I know one day

518
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:12,000
you'll leave me.

519
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:13,820
How could it be possible?

520
00:25:13,850 --> 00:25:14,810
Who said that?

521
00:25:15,270 --> 00:25:18,570
I feel that I'm so useless.

522
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:21,740
I can't do anything well.

523
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:24,790
I can't help you eliminate the Bamboo Snake.

524
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:28,660
Nor could I help you refute what those Taoist priests said.

525
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:30,400
Gu Qing...

526
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:33,840
As long as Gu Qing says something,

527
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:36,330
she can solve these problems for you.

528
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:39,970
Those people also said that...

529
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:44,120
They said that you two are a perfect match,

530
00:25:44,830 --> 00:25:47,640
and that you're suitable for each other.

531
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:50,060
Alright, alright, alright. Stop crying.

532
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:52,480
Stop crying. Alright.

533
00:25:53,470 --> 00:25:54,200
Alright, alright.

534
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,910
Didn't I tell you this before?

535
00:25:58,430 --> 00:25:59,760
Don't compare yourself with them.

536
00:26:00,930 --> 00:26:01,590
Besides,

537
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,810
even if you know nothing,

538
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:04,790
and can't do anything,

539
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:07,350
you're still my beloved one.

540
00:26:09,990 --> 00:26:11,800
What do you mean by saying taht I know nothing

541
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:13,290
and can't do anything?

542
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:14,620
Ruochen.

543
00:26:16,110 --> 00:26:16,750
You said

544
00:26:17,950 --> 00:26:19,570
I'm your beloved one,

545
00:26:20,190 --> 00:26:20,930
but

546
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:23,400
you've never told me that

547
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:25,070
you like me.

548
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:31,060
That's because there's a problem

549
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:33,800
in my mind which hasn't been solved yet.

550
00:26:41,150 --> 00:26:42,990
Ruochen, don't go.

551
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,030
When I can

552
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:51,830
tell you about my real identity,

553
00:26:52,730 --> 00:26:54,660
then it'll be the time to confess my feelings to you.

554
00:26:56,230 --> 00:26:58,480
I hope I can confess my love to you with my real identity,

555
00:26:59,790 --> 00:27:01,160
and that the person you really like

556
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:02,950
will be me, Clerk Ji,

557
00:27:03,670 --> 00:27:05,380
instead of the Ultimate Banished God.

558
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:10,520
I hope by that time, you won't blame me

559
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:13,710
for making you wait for so long

560
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:17,100
or blame me for lying to you for so long.

561
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:21,180
Wait for me.

562
00:27:51,410 --> 00:27:51,960
Fairy Gu.

563
00:27:55,550 --> 00:27:56,950
Why are you still up, Fairy Gu?

564
00:28:00,490 --> 00:28:02,810
I was frivolous just now after getting drunk.

565
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:04,060
I'm sorry.

566
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:05,780
It's okay.

567
00:28:06,790 --> 00:28:07,210
By the way,

568
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:09,070
This is some hangover relief medicine.

569
00:28:09,470 --> 00:28:11,240
You might feel better after taking it.

570
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:15,370
Thank you.

571
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:17,210
Ruochen.

572
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:19,180
If the Bamboo Snake are not born yet,

573
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:21,390
the treasures that it carries

574
00:28:21,850 --> 00:28:23,220
won't appear in the mortal world.

575
00:28:23,970 --> 00:28:24,980
Do you think it's a pity?

576
00:28:27,010 --> 00:28:28,010
Why is it a pity?

577
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:30,350
It'll be all right if it isn't born.

578
00:28:30,930 --> 00:28:32,050
Nothing is more important than

579
00:28:32,070 --> 00:28:33,310
the lives of the people in Haofang.

580
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:34,840
Have you ever thought that

581
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:35,810
your prevention of its birth

582
00:28:36,110 --> 00:28:37,540
may hinder those who

583
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:38,640
want to acquire the treasures?

584
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:40,290
They won't let you off.

585
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:44,280
Then I'll take measures according to

586
00:28:44,810 --> 00:28:45,900
the actual situation.

587
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:47,330
Okay.

588
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:49,780
Since you've made up your mind,

589
00:28:50,850 --> 00:28:52,720
I will help you wholeheartedly.

590
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:57,470
On behalf of the people of Haofang,

591
00:28:57,540 --> 00:28:58,320
I'd like to thank you, Fairy Gu.

592
00:28:58,950 --> 00:28:59,470
Fairy Gu.

593
00:28:59,830 --> 00:29:00,850
If there's nothing else,

594
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:02,150
I'll go back and rest.

595
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:03,250
You should rest early, too.

596
00:29:09,510 --> 00:29:10,370
One day,

597
00:29:11,790 --> 00:29:13,140
I will remind you of me.

598
00:29:20,390 --> 00:29:21,020
Miss Yinyin,

599
00:29:21,390 --> 00:29:22,950
there seems to be nothing unusual here.

600
00:29:23,050 --> 00:29:24,450
I wonder how it is going with Mr. Ji's and Fairy Gu's

601
00:29:24,490 --> 00:29:25,230
searching for the lair.

602
00:29:26,470 --> 00:29:27,880
Let's send the Flying Crane to ask them, and we'll know, right?

603
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:40,360
Yinyin.

604
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:42,350
Be careful. I'm fine here.

605
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:47,140
Miss Yinyin,

606
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:49,270
Mr. Ji didn't write anything funny.

607
00:29:49,290 --> 00:29:50,280
Why are you laughing?

608
00:29:50,530 --> 00:29:52,120
Don't ask so much, kid.

609
00:29:57,810 --> 00:29:59,120
Why did you get surprised so suddenly?

610
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:02,000
So this is what love is like?

611
00:30:02,410 --> 00:30:03,360
How do you know?

612
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:06,170
Do you also feel this way when you see Ruochen?

613
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:07,930
I also feel this way when I see you.

614
00:30:08,470 --> 00:30:09,710
Stop talking sweetly.

615
00:30:09,970 --> 00:30:11,460
Little goblin, let me tell you.

616
00:30:11,710 --> 00:30:12,830
If you dare to like Ruochen...

617
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:14,320
You'll make me into snake soup.

618
00:30:14,510 --> 00:30:15,130
I know.

619
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:18,230
Let's go.

620
00:30:18,930 --> 00:30:19,700
By the way, Miss Yinyin,

621
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,920
does Fairy Gu also like Mr. Ji?

622
00:30:22,210 --> 00:30:24,000
Every time when I saw her looking at Mr. Ji,

623
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:24,990
she always smiled.

624
00:30:26,150 --> 00:30:27,740
Besides, when we were in the Tingsong Building,

625
00:30:27,990 --> 00:30:28,870
I heard that

626
00:30:28,890 --> 00:30:31,650
Fairy Gu and Mr. Ji were predestined to be a couple.

627
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:32,720
What does it mean?

628
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:36,070
They were just talking nonsense.

629
00:30:36,310 --> 00:30:37,070
Ignore what they said.

630
00:30:37,150 --> 00:30:37,550
Let's go.

631
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:46,730
Go, go, go.

632
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:49,940
Well, Mr. Ji.

633
00:30:50,310 --> 00:30:52,030
Both of us have a question all the time.

634
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:53,850
I don't know if I should ask you about it.

635
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:56,170
No, you shouldn't.

636
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:58,040
But if we don't ask you,

637
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:59,520
we'll feel so disturbed.

638
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:00,230
Yes, yes, yes.

639
00:31:00,540 --> 00:31:01,180
Mr. Ji.

640
00:31:02,410 --> 00:31:04,650
Don't you like Fairy Gu?

641
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:06,500
Instead, you like the fierce Zhang Yinyin?

642
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:08,210
Why do you think she's fierce?

643
00:31:08,250 --> 00:31:09,730
She's merely straightforward.

644
00:31:10,810 --> 00:31:11,880
That's not right.

645
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:14,070
But I think Fairy Gu seems to

646
00:31:14,550 --> 00:31:16,120
like you very much.

647
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:16,870
Yes, yes, yes.

648
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:20,840
She has mistaken me for someone else.

649
00:31:22,670 --> 00:31:23,600
She has mistaken you for someone else?

650
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:25,320
It can't be.

651
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:27,040
-Look. They both... -What is that?

652
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:27,490
Right.

653
00:31:34,210 --> 00:31:35,250
Gosh! Demon!

654
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:38,340
Didn't you two say that

655
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:39,330
you have magical weapons?

656
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:41,350
Did you say that?

657
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,540
Yes, the magic weapons.

658
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:46,350
Take the magical weapons out.

659
00:31:46,670 --> 00:31:47,670
Don't you have them all?

660
00:31:47,670 --> 00:31:48,390
You should take them out.

661
00:31:48,390 --> 00:31:48,970
You should take them out.

662
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:50,660
You should take them out!

663
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:54,040
Run!

664
00:33:26,630 --> 00:33:27,600
How come you are here?

665
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:29,990
Due to the good effect of your two pills,

666
00:33:30,510 --> 00:33:31,330
the toxins have been removed,

667
00:33:31,870 --> 00:33:32,830
so I came to Haofang.

668
00:33:34,060 --> 00:33:34,810
In that case,

669
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:36,940
I've repaid your kindness to save me.

670
00:33:37,470 --> 00:33:38,750
You don't have to help me anymore.

671
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:40,240
I've told you...

672
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:41,480
Our Qingxu Sect is also looking for that demon.

673
00:33:42,130 --> 00:33:42,570
Today,

674
00:33:43,330 --> 00:33:44,080
it's just a coincidence that we've met each other.

675
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:48,980
Wait, Fairy.

676
00:33:51,790 --> 00:33:52,500
What else?

677
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:54,670
Fairy,

678
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:56,930
are you helping Ji Ruochen look for that demon?

679
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:01,350
I'm doing this for him,

680
00:34:03,030 --> 00:34:04,640
and for the people of Haofang.

681
00:34:09,750 --> 00:34:10,699
Then from now on,

682
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:13,070
I will look for the demon with you.

683
00:34:18,679 --> 00:34:19,750
The system of the Hao River is complicated.

684
00:34:20,010 --> 00:34:21,429
There are still many river courses that haven't been inspected.

685
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:23,199
If you really want to help me,

686
00:34:23,590 --> 00:34:25,150
you can help to check other sections of the river.

687
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:26,770
There's no need to stay with me.

688
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:38,679
Zhang Yinyin is a monster?

689
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,159
How is that possible?

690
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:43,190
Xixuan Sect is the top sect of immortal cultivation.

691
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:45,400
Why would she give up being an immortal

692
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:46,690
and become a monster instead?

693
00:34:47,139 --> 00:34:48,219
I heard Fairy Gu say that

694
00:34:48,510 --> 00:34:50,150
outside the Tingsong Building.

695
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:53,250
Zhang Yinyin and Qingyi also admitted it.

696
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,040
Master Huihai,

697
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:56,969
please think about it carefully.

698
00:34:57,670 --> 00:34:59,980
Immortal Ji is the the Ultimate Banished God.

699
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:00,960
He has fulfulled his cultivation.

700
00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:04,050
How could it be possible that he's unable to find

701
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:05,160
the traces of that demon?

702
00:35:05,710 --> 00:35:07,550
That female monster must have used the Monster's Art

703
00:35:07,550 --> 00:35:09,050
to bewitch him.

704
00:35:09,270 --> 00:35:10,390
That female monster

705
00:35:10,610 --> 00:35:13,810
might want to get the treasures which the demon carries.

706
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:18,590
If you say so,

707
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:20,090
that makes sense.

708
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:21,620
In that case,

709
00:35:21,730 --> 00:35:23,090
let's eliminate this female monster

710
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:25,430
and help Immortal Ji get rid of the bewitchment.

711
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:31,220
My Lord,

712
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:33,260
those two female monsters have entered the city from the East Gate.

713
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:37,380
Thank you all for your hard work.

714
00:35:39,230 --> 00:35:39,770
Let’s go.

715
00:35:45,250 --> 00:35:47,120
Your trick to use others to kill them

716
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:48,970
is really brilliant.

717
00:36:03,990 --> 00:36:04,980
I don’t know why

718
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:07,200
they want to frame Senior Yin for being a monster.

719
00:36:08,230 --> 00:36:09,980
I'd better inform Senior Ji to take precautions.

720
00:36:27,230 --> 00:36:27,700
Look.

721
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:31,320
See?

722
00:36:31,510 --> 00:36:32,800
It must be Zhang Yinyin's.

723
00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:36,100
Mr. Ji!

724
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:38,250
Mr. Ji!

725
00:36:40,870 --> 00:36:42,400
Mr. Ji!

726
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:43,880
Mr. Ji!

727
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:49,900
Mr. Ji!

728
00:36:55,470 --> 00:36:57,210
Mr. Ji, have you found it?

729
00:36:57,830 --> 00:36:59,090
The demonic energy here is too strong.

730
00:36:59,310 --> 00:37:00,480
It's probably here.

731
00:37:08,910 --> 00:37:09,540
Yinyin.

732
00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:14,270
Mr. Ji, where are you going?

733
00:37:14,290 --> 00:37:14,890
Wait for us!

734
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:15,640
Wait for us!

735
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:16,720
Have you seen two strange women?

736
00:37:16,750 --> 00:37:17,400
No.

737
00:37:17,420 --> 00:37:19,030
Have you seen two strange women?

738
00:37:19,510 --> 00:37:20,280
These people

739
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:22,080
have time to chat with others here,

740
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:23,800
but they don't help Ruochen search for the demon.

741
00:37:24,070 --> 00:37:25,580
They even claimed to kill the demons.

742
00:37:26,590 --> 00:37:27,430
Miss Yinyin.

743
00:37:27,950 --> 00:37:29,920
Are they trying to catch me?

744
00:37:30,230 --> 00:37:31,110
Don't worry.

745
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:32,300
Your monster energy is not exposed.

746
00:37:34,770 --> 00:37:35,810
Master, they're over there.

747
00:37:38,230 --> 00:37:39,560
It seems they're really looking for you.

748
00:37:40,310 --> 00:37:40,980
Run!

749
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:42,920
Chase them!

750
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:45,240
Move! Move!

751
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:53,030
This way.

752
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,940
Miss Yinyin, how about you just hand me over to them?

753
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,450
Don't be silly.

754
00:37:59,550 --> 00:38:00,470
Am I that kind of person?

755
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:03,230
How do you know I'm having a drink here?

756
00:38:03,430 --> 00:38:03,930
Come on.

757
00:38:04,930 --> 00:38:05,290
Let's go!

758
00:38:05,310 --> 00:38:05,680
Go!

759
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:10,770
Chase them!

760
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:12,580
Move!

761
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:15,250
Where are they?

762
00:38:17,070 --> 00:38:18,220
It's so strange.

763
00:38:19,660 --> 00:38:21,940
I remember you are the follower of King of Haofang.

764
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:22,890
Your name is Ji Tianxia.

765
00:38:24,190 --> 00:38:24,930
Thank you very much for your help.

766
00:38:25,850 --> 00:38:26,150
Please.

767
00:38:27,270 --> 00:38:29,830
It's rare that someone remembers me, an unpopular follower.

768
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:31,720
Young lady,

769
00:38:31,750 --> 00:38:33,860
we can be considered as bosom friends.

770
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:34,990
Cheers.

771
00:38:35,210 --> 00:38:36,100
Let's drink.

772
00:38:36,670 --> 00:38:38,100
Monster, you want to escape?
