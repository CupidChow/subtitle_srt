[Divine Destiny]

00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:37,970
[Episode 32]

4
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,190
Now!

5
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:31,960
Yinfeng.

6
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:35,250
Yinfeng!

7
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:46,900
How could this happen?

8
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:49,000
How could this happen?

9
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:51,230
Qing.

10
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:53,140
I'm so cold.

11
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:54,930
I'm so cold.

12
00:02:57,770 --> 00:02:58,350
Yinfeng.

13
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,090
Where is your immortal dharma-laksana?

14
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:04,810
Why can't I see your immortal dharma-laksana?

15
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:09,490
Qing.

16
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:12,000
I'm sorry.

17
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:13,810
I'm afraid...

18
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:16,250
I'm afraid I can't

19
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:19,550
return to the God Realm with you.

20
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:41,240
You gave me your immortal dharma-laksana.

21
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:44,780
Please forgive me.

22
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:49,079
When you return to the Wuding River,

23
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:54,640
forget everything in this life.

24
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:59,930
I've protected you for 99 lifetimes.

25
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:05,370
I have no regrets in this life.

26
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:28,050
Are you done killing?

27
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,670
Take my life.

28
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:36,080
Stop now.

29
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:39,100
Ji Ruochen.

30
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:42,470
If I could turn back time,

31
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:49,070
I would never let myself fall in love with you again.

32
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:54,760
Qing.

33
00:04:55,570 --> 00:04:56,210
Qing!

34
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:01,470
Stop fighting!

35
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:05,650
I know you're not that kind of person.

36
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,280
Anyone related to Qingxu

37
00:05:12,170 --> 00:05:13,010
must be killed.

38
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:14,330
Step aside.

39
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:16,890
But she is Gu Qing.

40
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:21,510
Although she stabbed you once,

41
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:24,850
she also saved my life.

42
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,890
Yun Zhong Ju also saved my father.

43
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,380
I came to seek revenge.

44
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,510
It has nothing to do with her.

45
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,480
I won't let you kill her.

46
00:05:41,659 --> 00:05:44,909
You bully the weak and don't tell right from wrong.

47
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:47,780
You're not the Junior Ji I know.

48
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:56,900
The Ji Ruochen you know

49
00:05:57,890 --> 00:05:59,820
is not the real me.

50
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,480
Deities and demons have different paths.

51
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:54,720
From now on,

52
00:06:56,930 --> 00:06:58,930
we shouldn't meet anymore.

53
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:24,790
What?

54
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:27,580
I kindly invited you to my house.

55
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:29,320
Aren't you happy?

56
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:30,850
You...

57
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:31,920
Is this how you treat a guest?

58
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:32,890
Do you know who I am?

59
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:34,280
I am Li Xuanzhen,

60
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:36,010
the last disciple Master Ziyun has taken in.

61
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:37,430
Mind yourself. My master may set fire to your cave

62
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:38,970
when he comes.

63
00:07:40,690 --> 00:07:41,580
You loser.

64
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,090
If you think about it,

65
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:44,800
I saved your life today.

66
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:46,860
Now you're turning your back on me.

67
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,490
You're just like your master.

68
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:51,060
In terms of martial arts,

69
00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:54,350
on this mountain,

70
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:56,580
only Ziwei is comparable with me.

71
00:07:57,770 --> 00:07:58,659
Go get help.

72
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:00,980
If one comes, I'll kill one.

73
00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:02,770
If two come, I'll kill both.

74
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,840
Senior.

75
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:11,080
I know you're also from Xixuan.

76
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:14,780
I guess your master must be friends with my master.

77
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:17,180
In terms of seniority,

78
00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:19,880
I should call you Master.

79
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:25,920
Master, I'm timid.

80
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:28,260
I was scared just now.

81
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:30,150
That's why I offended you.

82
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:31,780
You're so generous. Please forgive me.

83
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,190
Don't take it into heart.

84
00:08:34,409 --> 00:08:35,179
How about this?

85
00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:36,780
Untie me first.

86
00:08:37,169 --> 00:08:38,789
I'll kneel down and kowtow to you

87
00:08:39,010 --> 00:08:40,659
to show my respect, okay?

88
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:44,100
You're quite smart.

89
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:45,820
I was right about you.

90
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:46,870
Good.

91
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:51,420
Thank you, Master.

92
00:08:57,660 --> 00:08:58,960
You're ugly but you're still not honest.

93
00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:00,090
Why didn't you kowtow to me?

94
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:01,300
Senior.

95
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,120
Who did you call

96
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:03,160
the ugliest in the world today?

97
00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:04,840
Who did you call the ugliest in the world?

98
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:05,410
Stop hitting me.

99
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:06,390
If I had known this would happen,

100
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:07,570
I would rather have been

101
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:08,560
slapped to death by Wangchen.

102
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:09,720
What nonsense are you talking about?

103
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:11,590
How can you compare me to him?

104
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:12,540
How are you comparable to him?

105
00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:13,000
You...

106
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:22,280
Right.

107
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,350
How am I comparable to him?

108
00:09:34,290 --> 00:09:34,880
Uglier.

109
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:36,950
Come and kowtow.

110
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:39,850
Who are you calling Uglier?

111
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,140
You call me the ugliest?

112
00:09:44,570 --> 00:09:45,530
I want you to be my disciple.

113
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:47,690
Of course I can only call you Uglier.

114
00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:49,170
Who wants to be your disciple?

115
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:50,630
If I don't take you in as my disciple,

116
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:52,430
why would I bring you here?

117
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:55,120
I've been a member of the Xuanming Palace for a long time.

118
00:09:55,650 --> 00:09:56,160
Besides,

119
00:09:56,370 --> 00:09:57,190
who wants to learn

120
00:09:57,530 --> 00:09:58,940
your bilocation skills?

121
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:00,040
Are you

122
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:02,520
willing to be a loser forever?

123
00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:06,570
Don't you want to be as strong as me?

124
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:09,610
If you master the Bowing and Nodding Technique,

125
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:11,240
you will replace me

126
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:13,940
as the ultimate secret of the Xixuan Sect.

127
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:17,910
The ultimate secret?

128
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:23,570
So, you are the ultimate secret of Xixuan Mountains.

129
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:33,110
Okay, it's a deal.

130
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:35,220
But on three conditions.

131
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:37,590
First,

132
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:40,770
I can't betray my original master and the sect.

133
00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:42,440
Second,

134
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,560
you can't insult anyone from Xixuan anymore.

135
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:46,560
Third,

136
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:50,280
don't call me Uglier again.

137
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:55,210
Okay, deal.

138
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:57,840
Then I won't call you Uglier.

139
00:10:58,630 --> 00:10:59,060
Little loser.

140
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:01,580
Come and kowtow to me.

141
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:02,960
No.

142
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,710
Then you should at least call me Master.

143
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:05,480
No.

144
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:07,470
You little loser!

145
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:08,590
I...

146
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:09,130
Where are you going?

147
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:10,240
Senior! Senior!

148
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:11,670
I'm sorry.

149
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:12,670
Where are you going?

150
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:13,590
No. I won't run.

151
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,390
Why did you bring me here?

152
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,540
You still remember this place?

153
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:29,030
Put me down first.

154
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:48,560
Senior Yunfeng and I hid here for a few days

155
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,650
when we were hunted down by people from the Zhenwu Temple.

156
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:52,410
You only remember Senior Yunfeng.

157
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:53,930
Is there anyone else?

158
00:11:56,470 --> 00:11:57,900
Who else should I remember? You?

159
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:06,160
Yes, me.

160
00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:19,830
What are you doing?

161
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:21,550
I want to cure you.

162
00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:27,020
You'd better take me back to Master Yuxuan in Xixuan.

163
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:19,140
I'm much better.

164
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:20,870
Thank you.

165
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:27,930
Is what you said true?

166
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:30,720
You were here at that time?

167
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:34,730
You know what?

168
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:37,830
I've always thought you're familiar,

169
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:41,060
but I don't remember where I saw you.

170
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:45,150
Maybe it's because I was poisoned

171
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:46,530
and forgot many things.

172
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:49,090
If you remember anything,

173
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:50,710
you must tell me.

174
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,430
But if you remember it,

175
00:13:54,330 --> 00:13:57,450
your headache will make you much more painful than the poison.

176
00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:03,250
It's getting late.

177
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:04,560
Rest early.

178
00:14:19,370 --> 00:14:20,660
What I want the most now

179
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:22,700
is that you can be safe.

180
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,600
I can see you

181
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:26,350
whenever I want.

182
00:14:37,890 --> 00:14:38,480
Master.

183
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:40,680
Ji Ruochen has become the Demon King

184
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:41,820
and returned to the mortal world.

185
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:43,430
He ruined my plan of conquering Xixuan

186
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:46,920
on his own.

187
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:49,350
I already knew about this.

188
00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:51,190
It doesn't matter.

189
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:54,490
It's good for Ji Ruochen to return to the mortal world.

190
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:55,840
Let him sink in…

191
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:57,540
Let him sink in…

192
00:14:57,570 --> 00:14:58,860
love for now.

193
00:14:59,450 --> 00:15:00,730
Leave him alone.

194
00:15:01,450 --> 00:15:03,570
When I'm about to succeed,

195
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:06,220
Demon King and Xixuan

196
00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:09,320
are nothing but dust to me.

197
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:11,770
But Ji Ruochen hates me so much.

198
00:15:12,290 --> 00:15:13,580
If he comes to seek revenge,

199
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,550
I'll be dead.

200
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:20,070
When I become the strongest in the world,

201
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:22,450
I will help you destroy the Xixuan Sect

202
00:15:22,890 --> 00:15:24,490
and kill Ji Ruochen.

203
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:26,050
I'll grant your wish

204
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:29,400
to become the leader of the world's best sect.

205
00:15:29,830 --> 00:15:30,500
Master.

206
00:15:32,530 --> 00:15:36,730
I'm afraid I can't live until that day.

207
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:43,150
I'll give you a Soul of Immortal Cloud.

208
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:47,150
Gu Qing wants to return to the God Realm with it.

209
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:50,980
Go back and practice.

210
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:10,000
Thank you, Master.

211
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:22,670
Yinyin.

212
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:24,130
Yinyin.

213
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:30,020
I told you to rest.

214
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:31,100
Why did you come down?

215
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:34,230
None of your business.

216
00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:37,890
Why are you always so disobedient?

217
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:39,870
Even if you want revenge,

218
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:41,730
how can you break into the Qingxu Sect alone?

219
00:16:42,450 --> 00:16:43,410
If I hadn't helped,

220
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:45,140
do you know what would have happened?

221
00:16:46,850 --> 00:16:47,810
So what?

222
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:50,530
My Heavenly Fox Secret Technique has advanced to another level.

223
00:16:51,190 --> 00:16:52,510
I can protect myself.

224
00:16:53,090 --> 00:16:53,680
Really?

225
00:16:54,850 --> 00:16:56,470
Who's the one severely injured now?

226
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:57,950
As you know,

227
00:16:58,220 --> 00:17:00,230
the higher level you get into, the harder it becomes for you to further improve the Heavenly Fox Secret Technique.

228
00:17:00,570 --> 00:17:01,980
How will you protect yourself next time?

229
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:06,579
I hope you won't act so rashly

230
00:17:07,069 --> 00:17:07,970
next time.

231
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:14,300
How can I calm down for the revenge of my parents?

232
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:16,900
Would you calm down if you were me?

233
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:19,550
Who are you to tell me what to do?

234
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:23,050
Even if you cured me and saved me,

235
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:25,390
you can't treat me like this.

236
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:33,540
You promised me.

237
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:35,570
No matter what I do,

238
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:36,820
you won't get mad at me.

239
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:39,900
You're obviously lying.

240
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:42,750
How could I agree to this?

241
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:44,830
With my temper,

242
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
it would only cause trouble for me.

243
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:52,730
You just forgot

244
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:54,870
what you did before.

245
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:03,880
Do you want to hear about our past?

246
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:06,090
I can tell you now.

247
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:09,330
Go ahead.

248
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:11,900
If you dare to lie to me,

249
00:18:12,410 --> 00:18:13,490
you're going to suffer the consequences.

250
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:38,440
These are our past.

251
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:43,900
Do you believe it?

252
00:18:46,330 --> 00:18:47,020
Yes.

253
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:50,800
Although I don't remember

254
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:53,330
any of what you said,

255
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,340
but who else

256
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:57,980
would do such things

257
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:00,330
besides me?

258
00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:10,030
Are you sad about

259
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:13,270
me forgetting you?

260
00:19:17,730 --> 00:19:18,930
How can I not be sad?

261
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:26,750
But what upsets me more

262
00:19:27,510 --> 00:19:29,420
is how painful for you to remember the past.

263
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,690
But sometimes I just couldn't help

264
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,740
bringing you to this place full of our memories.

265
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:36,800
It's a place that belongs to us.

266
00:19:39,990 --> 00:19:41,500
Just like when you got hurt this time,

267
00:19:42,610 --> 00:19:44,700
I could have brought you back to Xixuan Mountains,

268
00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:48,750
but the first thought in my mind

269
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:52,330
was to bring you here.

270
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:58,720
You just said

271
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:02,130
I took care of you here.

272
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:17,940
We have the most unforgettable memories here

273
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:25,200
that only belong to us.

274
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:34,130
Is this what we'll end up like

275
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:36,620
for the rest of our lives?

276
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,360
Since Master Iceberg can remove your memories,

277
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,570
she can also regain your memories.

278
00:20:45,430 --> 00:20:46,400
We can go find her.

279
00:20:47,290 --> 00:20:48,040
Of course not.

280
00:20:49,450 --> 00:20:50,600
What are you going to do?

281
00:20:55,330 --> 00:20:56,140
Don't worry.

282
00:20:57,260 --> 00:20:59,070
It’s late. You should sleep early.

283
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:25,860
Fox Demon Zhang Yinyin killed the Hierarch of our sect.

284
00:21:26,210 --> 00:21:27,940
Demon King Ji Ruochen killed my disciple.

285
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:31,460
Qingxu and Xixuan are already sworn enemies.

286
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:33,780
We can't coexist. We must take revenge.

287
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:35,780
Now that the Hierarch is killed,

288
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:37,790
we need a leader in the Qingxu Sect.

289
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:38,970
Please take over the role

290
00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:40,360
and lead the disciples to take revenge.

291
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:41,360
Revenge?

292
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:42,910
In that case,

293
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:45,230
I'll do as you suggest.

294
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,840
As long as we work together,

295
00:21:49,770 --> 00:21:51,380
we can definitely revive Qingxu.

296
00:21:51,850 --> 00:21:52,780
Hierarch, you are right.

297
00:21:53,550 --> 00:21:55,680
But Qingxu is severely injured.

298
00:21:56,150 --> 00:21:57,840
I'm afraid it'll be hard for us to make a comeback.

299
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:58,840
Don't worry.

300
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:00,540
I've asked the banished god.

301
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:02,510
He has given up on returning to the God Realm

302
00:22:03,330 --> 00:22:04,900
and decided to stay in Qingxu.

303
00:22:05,470 --> 00:22:06,320
Stay in Qingxu?

304
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:07,420
He won't leave? Really?

305
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:09,460
I know what you're thinking.

306
00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:11,250
I'm thinking about the same.

307
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:13,720
I will persuade the banished god

308
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:15,520
to hand over the seven volumes of the Book of Heaven.

309
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:20,320
By then, the disciples of Qingxu will practice

310
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:21,340
the Book of Heaven.

311
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:23,470
We'll defeat Demon King Ji Ruochen for sure.

312
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:25,690
Surpassing Xixuan

313
00:22:26,410 --> 00:22:27,880
is only a matter of time.

314
00:22:29,170 --> 00:22:29,750
In that case,

315
00:22:29,770 --> 00:22:30,870
we can also practice the Book of Heaven.

316
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:31,780
Great!

317
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:32,550
Good.

318
00:23:14,050 --> 00:23:15,420
I'm fine now.

319
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:16,670
Don't worry.

320
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:19,830
Your immortal dharma-laksana…

321
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:20,620
Qing.

322
00:23:21,410 --> 00:23:23,840
At this point, don't mention it again.

323
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:27,770
But are you really willing to stay in the mortal world forever?

324
00:23:28,970 --> 00:23:30,490
We're talking about the God Realm

325
00:23:30,770 --> 00:23:32,870
you've always been wanting to go back to.

326
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:36,150
You're wrong.

327
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:38,700
I've been practicing for a hundred years.

328
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:42,710
All I want is to let you return to the God Realm.

329
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:44,950
It's no longer that important

330
00:23:46,090 --> 00:23:47,200
to me.

331
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:54,010
I didn't want to return to the God Realm at all.

332
00:23:55,660 --> 00:23:56,860
Now I've got your immortal dharma-laksana.

333
00:23:57,420 --> 00:23:59,280
I have no reason to go back alone.

334
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:01,810
Besides, don't you think

335
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:03,920
after a hundred years,

336
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:06,790
especially the wrong fate in this life,

337
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:09,690
we're becoming more and more like humans?

338
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:11,320
That's why

339
00:24:12,050 --> 00:24:13,130
you should go back.

340
00:24:14,070 --> 00:24:16,610
Isn't it good to have emotions and desires

341
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:18,650
like humans?

342
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:21,820
But as a human, you can't pursue a divine life

343
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:23,130
and live eternally.

344
00:24:27,690 --> 00:24:29,380
What's the point of

345
00:24:29,830 --> 00:24:30,950
being a bystander outside the Three Realms

346
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,360
with a heart like dead water?

347
00:24:34,990 --> 00:24:37,070
Anyway, stop persuading me.

348
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,060
I won't leave you alone.

349
00:24:46,870 --> 00:24:49,660
Qing, why are you so stubborn?

350
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:53,970
Senior.

351
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:58,210
[Tomb of Yunfeng, disciple of the Taichang Palace of Xixuan]

352
00:24:55,750 --> 00:24:56,980
We've avenged you.

353
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:01,440
Everything is settled in the Xixuan Sect.

354
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:03,550
Rest in peace.

355
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:07,240
Senior Yunfeng.

356
00:25:09,510 --> 00:25:11,980
Yinyin and I are leaving here.

357
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:16,940
Are we really going to Master Iceberg?

358
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:19,680
Yes.

359
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:22,460
We're going to Master Iceberg

360
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:24,460
to restore your memories.

361
00:25:26,250 --> 00:25:27,490
But you said yesterday

362
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:31,280
I exchanged Nuwa's Tears with my memories.

363
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:33,850
Now that we've used Nuwa's Tears,

364
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:36,820
why would she return the memories to me?

365
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:48,340
Those memories are useless to Master Iceberg,

366
00:25:50,030 --> 00:25:53,740
but they're precious to us.

367
00:25:54,870 --> 00:25:56,230
As long as she is willing to return them to me,

368
00:25:57,330 --> 00:25:58,760
I'm willing to do anything.

369
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:03,580
Yinyin.

370
00:26:04,970 --> 00:26:06,260
Are you worried about something?

371
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:08,220
If she refuses,

372
00:26:09,270 --> 00:26:11,180
don't bully her

373
00:26:11,690 --> 00:26:12,370
just because you're the Demon King and more capable than her.

374
00:26:14,090 --> 00:26:15,570
After all, I broke my promise.

375
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:21,920
Don't worry.

376
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:25,160
I have my own way.

377
00:26:30,770 --> 00:26:32,390
Actually, the Three Realms is under your control.

378
00:26:34,390 --> 00:26:35,720
Why are you still so persistent?

379
00:26:41,450 --> 00:26:42,290
Because without you,

380
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:44,550
even if I'm in control of the Three Realms,

381
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:46,700
it's meaningless to me.

382
00:26:50,610 --> 00:26:51,610
Are we really going in?

383
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:54,240
Since you dared to come to me,

384
00:26:54,260 --> 00:26:55,700
come in.

385
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:14,860
I remember.

386
00:27:15,350 --> 00:27:16,340
I've been here before.

387
00:27:23,650 --> 00:27:25,910
Demon King, you're so arrogant.

388
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:36,000
I've been here for thousands of years.

389
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:37,980
Only you two

390
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:39,700
dared to come back.

391
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:42,820
But let me make it first.

392
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:45,490
Nuwa's Tears can't be removed.

393
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:50,530
Back then, I've made it clear to you.

394
00:27:52,590 --> 00:27:53,400
Master Iceberg.

395
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:57,400
Why did you refuse us so fast?

396
00:27:58,790 --> 00:28:01,350
As long as you remove Nuwa's Tears,

397
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:04,380
I'll do anything you want me to do.

398
00:28:05,770 --> 00:28:07,500
Anything.

399
00:28:08,450 --> 00:28:11,270
If Demon King

400
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:13,220
gives me

401
00:28:13,790 --> 00:28:15,340
all your capabilities,

402
00:28:16,050 --> 00:28:17,220
in this case,

403
00:28:17,450 --> 00:28:19,180
I can consider it.

404
00:28:20,770 --> 00:28:23,930
Otherwise, even if you are the Demon King,

405
00:28:23,950 --> 00:28:26,330
you can't do whatever you want at my Sky Mending Cliff.

406
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:31,230
Of course I can give you my capabilities as Demon King,

407
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:36,580
but can you afford it?

408
00:28:38,590 --> 00:28:39,780
I was just kidding.

409
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:42,510
What's the use of your capabilities to me?

410
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:44,200
Master Iceberg.

411
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:46,660
Stop wasting time.

412
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:49,060
Since I dared to come here,

413
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:51,150
I must achieve my goal.

414
00:28:52,150 --> 00:28:55,460
Tell me how to remove Nuwa's Tears.

415
00:28:55,630 --> 00:28:56,420
It can't be removed.

416
00:28:57,590 --> 00:28:58,320
Zhang Yinyin.

417
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:01,880
You volunteered to exchange memories with me.

418
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:04,790
Now you're taking advantage of me.

419
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:06,710
What's the point of breaking your promise?

420
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:12,970
I've told you

421
00:29:13,170 --> 00:29:14,590
even if you are the Demon King,

422
00:29:14,690 --> 00:29:16,990
you can't do whatever you want at the Sky Mending Cliff.

423
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:21,260
If I destroy this place,

424
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:24,240
then Nuwa's Tears will have nowhere to rely on.

425
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:27,060
Can it be removed by then?

426
00:29:27,130 --> 00:29:28,120
How dare you!

427
00:29:29,830 --> 00:29:32,150
If I had known you'd turn against me today,

428
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:35,050
I shouldn't have saved you with Nuwa's Tears.

429
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:37,610
Master Iceberg.

430
00:29:38,530 --> 00:29:40,170
I know it’s my fault for breaking my promise.

431
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:41,930
I just...

432
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:44,700
I just know

433
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:46,440
these memories are very precious to him,

434
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:49,520
so I want you to help me remove Nuwa's Tears.

435
00:29:50,270 --> 00:29:51,060
I can give you

436
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:51,990
whatever you want.

437
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:55,030
It's useless to say anything.

438
00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:57,220
I've told you it can't be removed.

439
00:29:58,690 --> 00:29:59,370
You should go.

440
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:04,260
Is there really no solution?

441
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:06,320
Master Iceberg.

442
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:10,710
Let me tell you.

443
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:29,860
The spiritual caves have been destroyed.

444
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:32,120
What holds up the Monster Forbidden Zone

445
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:34,310
is definitely not the original spiritual power of the world.

446
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:36,870
What could it be?

447
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:40,670
Master Iceberg takes away people's memories.

448
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:43,940
Could the power in the Monster Forbidden Zone be people's willpower?

449
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,570
You're thinking highly of me.

450
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:51,640
But I know

451
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:54,630
the thing appears on the Shenzhou Energy Map

452
00:30:55,050 --> 00:30:57,640
must be the spiritual power that can affect the Three Realms.

453
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:04,930
My Monster Forbidden Zone doesn't have that much power.

454
00:31:06,430 --> 00:31:10,120
Demon King, how come you said so?

455
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:17,770
If you want to test me if I'm lying,

456
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:22,150
why don't you destroy this place

457
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:26,150
and see if Yinyin's memories can be recovered?

458
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:30,420
Master Iceberg, aren't you afraid?

459
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:32,710
Destroy the Monster Forbidden Zone?

460
00:31:53,060 --> 00:31:54,790
Uncle, what's wrong?

461
00:31:55,050 --> 00:31:56,860
Why have you been upset these days?

462
00:31:57,610 --> 00:32:00,450
I can't do anything to help. Of course I'm upset.

463
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:03,450
Are you talking about the chaos in the Three Realms?

464
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:05,620
Not just chaos.

465
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:08,200
It's a disaster.

466
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:13,810
Uncle, does it have anything to do with Mr. Ji becoming a demon?

467
00:32:16,530 --> 00:32:17,140
Yes.

468
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:21,580
Who else has the ability to turn the world upside down?

469
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:24,910
He seems to be coming soon.

470
00:32:25,790 --> 00:32:27,830
Uncle, can you stop him?

471
00:32:33,070 --> 00:32:33,690
I don't know.

472
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:37,180
Let's give it a try.

473
00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:41,020
Ji Ruochen.

474
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:45,340
You know my Monster Forbidden Zone is situated in the Endless Sea.

475
00:32:45,930 --> 00:32:47,140
Can you imagine how many tears

476
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:49,560
of sad people are there?

477
00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:51,380
If you want them to disappear,

478
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:54,520
you have to dry the Endless Sea.

479
00:32:55,430 --> 00:32:57,490
Demon King, since you came back from the Nine Hells,

480
00:32:57,980 --> 00:32:59,340
you should know

481
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:02,140
if the Endless Sea is dried,

482
00:33:02,330 --> 00:33:04,720
the Three Realms will be in chaos.

483
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:07,060
Will you really sit by

484
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:10,430
and do nothing to save the world

485
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:13,120
for your own benefits?

486
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:16,020
So drying the Endless Sea is the solution.

487
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:19,920
Thank you for your reminder.

488
00:33:24,110 --> 00:33:24,850
Ji Ruochen.

489
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:26,440
Ji Ruochen!

490
00:33:27,550 --> 00:33:29,350
If you dare to destroy my Monster Forbidden Zone,

491
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,070
I won't let you go.

492
00:33:33,030 --> 00:33:34,110
We can't destroy the Endless Sea!

493
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:40,400
You don't want your memories back?

494
00:33:41,180 --> 00:33:43,030
But we can’t do that at the cost of destroying the Endless Sea.

495
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:45,160
That’s Mr. Wu and Qingyi’s home.

496
00:33:45,670 --> 00:33:46,730
They saved me.

497
00:33:47,970 --> 00:33:48,980
But there's no other way.

498
00:33:51,210 --> 00:33:53,090
How do you know if you haven't tried?

499
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:55,060
Master Iceberg just said

500
00:33:55,390 --> 00:33:56,480
it'll cause trouble for the Three Realms.

501
00:33:57,170 --> 00:33:58,380
As Xixuan's disciples,

502
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:00,150
we are responsible for protecting the people.

503
00:34:00,550 --> 00:34:02,000
How can we cause trouble for the Three Realms?

504
00:34:02,610 --> 00:34:03,780
I won't let you go.

505
00:34:04,450 --> 00:34:06,120
Have you considered me?

506
00:34:07,050 --> 00:34:08,600
Do you know how painful I am

507
00:34:08,699 --> 00:34:10,000
looking at you like this?

508
00:34:11,239 --> 00:34:12,370
I still have a long life.

509
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:14,780
I don't want to live like this.

510
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:18,870
This time, you must listen to me.

511
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:22,590
You can stay if you don't want to go.

512
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:24,820
Just wait for me here.

513
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:26,920
I won't let you go.

514
00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:09,000
Should I call you Mr. Ji or Demon King now?

515
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:11,640
Did your uncle send you here?

516
00:35:17,630 --> 00:35:19,630
Can I persuade you?

517
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:22,120
Mr. Ji.

518
00:35:22,630 --> 00:35:24,640
Look how beautiful the Endless Sea is.

519
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:26,370
There are so many treasures.

520
00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:28,300
It's a pity to destroy them.

521
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:30,450
Please give it a second thought.

522
00:35:31,650 --> 00:35:32,410
Mr. Ji.

523
00:35:33,190 --> 00:35:35,410
Miss Qingyi treats you and Yinyin

524
00:35:35,710 --> 00:35:36,560
as her family.

525
00:35:37,610 --> 00:35:38,340
I'm afraid you'll make her sad

526
00:35:39,190 --> 00:35:40,460
by doing this.

527
00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:52,770
I’ll open an inn with Yinyin outside the town.

528
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:54,820
You can come with us.

529
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:00,950
Then I won’t have a home.

530
00:36:02,380 --> 00:36:04,600
Mr. Ji, do you really have to do this?

531
00:36:05,350 --> 00:36:05,790
Yes.

532
00:36:06,650 --> 00:36:08,270
Demon King, Master has ordered

533
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:10,100
those who break into the Endless Sea must be killed.

534
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,380
Demon King, Master wants to see you.

535
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:44,660
Master of Endless Sea.

536
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:46,540
I've heard a lot about you.

537
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:48,540
Demon King, I'm flattered.

538
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:52,530
Put down your weapons.

539
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:55,460
You are no match for Demon King.

540
00:36:55,820 --> 00:36:56,900
Even if I'm not comparable with him,

541
00:36:57,180 --> 00:36:58,280
I still need to protect my home,

542
00:36:58,370 --> 00:37:00,110
protect the Endless Sea and my uncle.

543
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:01,870
Me too.

544
00:37:03,220 --> 00:37:05,750
Mr. Ji, why do you have to do this?

545
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:08,120
Miss Qingyi is so sad.

546
00:37:08,950 --> 00:37:10,900
I’ll do it sooner or later.

547
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:13,250
You can't stop me.

548
00:37:14,290 --> 00:37:15,320
Why do you have to do this?

549
00:37:20,270 --> 00:37:21,030
I've imagined everything,

550
00:37:21,870 --> 00:37:23,310
but I didn't expect

551
00:37:24,130 --> 00:37:25,810
we would finally meet here.

552
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:30,530
So who are you?
