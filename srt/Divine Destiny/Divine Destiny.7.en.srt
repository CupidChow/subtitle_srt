[Episode 7]

4
00:01:50,289 --> 00:01:51,530
Let go of me!

5
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:52,800
Let go of me!

6
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:54,530
Let go!

7
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:56,789
You want to steal my stuff?

8
00:01:57,259 --> 00:01:58,460
Aren't you afraid that I'll use you to make pills?

9
00:01:58,460 --> 00:01:59,200
Uncle said

10
00:01:59,270 --> 00:01:59,990
if I don't tell him when I take his things,

11
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:01,100
that is stealing.

12
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:02,540
But the rabbit lives in the forest,

13
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:03,860
and the fruit grows in the forest.

14
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:04,900
They don't belong to you.

15
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:05,700
How can you call it stealing?

16
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:06,190
And

17
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:08,060
you removed the rabbit hair and roasted it.

18
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:09,500
This makes the rabbit meat greasy.

19
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,340
It tastes awful.

20
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:11,660
Even if this is really yours,

21
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:12,630
no one wants to steal it.

22
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:15,780
You're good at making excuses.

23
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:16,380
Let go!

24
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:17,450
Senior, she's over there.

25
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:18,420
Chase her!

26
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:21,070
Go!

27
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,220
Young hero.

28
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,140
What crime did this demon commit?

29
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:27,350
Why did you bring so many men

30
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:28,329
to catch her?

31
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:29,800
Young hero.

32
00:02:30,579 --> 00:02:31,890
We are all disciples of Liuxian Hall.

33
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:33,300
We are hunting this demon.

34
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:35,290
You look like

35
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:36,480
an immortality cultivator.

36
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:37,990
If you are,

37
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:39,460
how could you not know that

38
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:41,640
hunting demons is to take their weapons and to use them to make pills?

39
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:44,079
Coward.

40
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:46,380
Are you going to tell him

41
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:47,500
about the honeytrap?

42
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:48,110
Brother!

43
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:50,710
Let go of me!

44
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:52,110
-Let go! -Senior, I got her!

45
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:55,070
Let go!

46
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,000
It's really a honeytrap.

47
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:03,180
Let go of me!

48
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:09,010
Behave!

49
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:20,900
It seems that it's not only a honeytrap,

50
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:22,079
but also the ruse of self-injury.

51
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:34,070
The ruse of self-injury.

52
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:40,510
This demon is so tough.

53
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:41,750
I haven't seen anyone

54
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:43,170
not screaming when tied with the Deity Binding Rope.

55
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:45,180
The ruse of self-injury.

56
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:05,220
Why did you do that?

57
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:06,650
Everyone,

58
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:08,440
I want to ask you for a favor.

59
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:10,800
Please show mercy.

60
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,690
You should know the rules.

61
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:14,980
Since we found and tracked this demon,

62
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:16,010
others

63
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:17,779
shouldn't interfere.

64
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:21,180
What if I insist?

65
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:22,660
Then don't blame us for being rude.

66
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,520
Then I'll have to fight back.

67
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:36,130
The Divine Thunder Flame Formation.

68
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:37,220
Oh no!

69
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:40,300
Retreat!

70
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,600
So you're from Xixuan Sect.

71
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:46,170
Brat, let's wait and see.

72
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:57,060
Oh, did I expose myself?

73
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:00,110
This is bad.

74
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:21,540
Is this how you repay your savior?

75
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,270
Don't try to lie to me.

76
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:25,540
You just said you would use me to make pills.

77
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:27,480
I just...

78
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:28,980
I just wanted you

79
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:29,830
to compensate for my rabbit.

80
00:05:53,450 --> 00:05:54,240
My Neidan.

81
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:13,450
You're awake.

82
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:15,500
You didn't take my Neidan.

83
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:17,480
That's great.

84
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:20,580
Thank you.

85
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:22,060
You are really a good person.

86
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:25,060
Since you saved me,

87
00:06:25,170 --> 00:06:26,380
I'll forgive you for being unreasonable

88
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:28,060
and saying I stole your rabbit.

89
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:30,780
Thank you.

90
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:43,520
What's that smell? It smells good.

91
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:47,420
This is a pill I made for you.

92
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:47,970
You...

93
00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:51,430
Forget it.

94
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:54,260
It's the same whether you eat it or apply it.

95
00:06:56,630 --> 00:06:57,440
It's delicious.

96
00:06:57,659 --> 00:06:58,740
Your pill

97
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:00,420
tasted much better than the rabbit you roasted.

98
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:02,730
You actually think this pill is delicious?

99
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,080
Yes.

100
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:06,100
Since I came out,

101
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:07,500
I haven't eaten

102
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:08,980
such delicious food for a long time.

103
00:07:09,450 --> 00:07:11,680
Your taste is quite strange.

104
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:13,430
After taking the pill,

105
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:14,860
your wound will heal quickly.

106
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:17,740
But the wound on your leg...

107
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:19,370
Although this arrow is not poisonous,

108
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:21,130
it'll heal faster if you clean it.

109
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:22,470
Thank you.

110
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:26,450
What are you doing?

111
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:28,700
Please pull out the arrow for me.

112
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:29,860
Didn't you say it just now?

113
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:31,980
Do you want to go back on your words?

114
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:34,440
Wait a minute.

115
00:08:00,570 --> 00:08:01,660
Have a good rest tonight.

116
00:08:02,010 --> 00:08:03,210
Your wound will

117
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:04,700
almost heal tomorrow.

118
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:10,030
You used the Wenwang Landscape Tripod to make the pill.

119
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:11,580
Of course it'll heal.

120
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:15,340
You know the Wenwang Landscape Tripod?

121
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:18,150
Uncle has a book of weapons.

122
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:19,020
That's why I know it.

123
00:08:19,450 --> 00:08:20,380
Your uncle?

124
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:23,080
Who on earth are you?

125
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:28,790
I'm from Tianxing Mountain where demons gather.

126
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:29,920
My name is Qingyi.

127
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,520
I'm a green snake demon.

128
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:33,110
I grew up without parents.

129
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:34,419
I was adopted and raised by my uncle.

130
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,070
I left the mountain a few days ago.

131
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:38,500
I don't know how to control the demonic energy,

132
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:40,370
so I've been hunted by immortality cultivators.

133
00:08:42,659 --> 00:08:44,210
This woman is strange.

134
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,120
She knows the Wenwang Landscape Tripod.

135
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:47,500
Her long whip

136
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:48,780
doesn't look ordinary.

137
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:51,140
Her demonic power is disorderly,

138
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:52,660
but she didn't go crazy.

139
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:54,740
If she is really a honeytrap

140
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:55,670
set by those people,

141
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:58,160
I'd like to see what she wants to do.

142
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:01,070
I'm Ji Ruochen,

143
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:02,230
a disciple of Xixuan Sect.

144
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:03,540
May I ask

145
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:05,420
what you are going to do next?

146
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:06,370
I'm going to Haofang.

147
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,320
I knew it.

148
00:09:15,770 --> 00:09:16,850
Senior, it's me.

149
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:19,440
Zong Ze.

150
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:20,900
Seniors and juniors,

151
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:22,630
avenge me.

152
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:24,730
Who hurt you?

153
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:26,860
A disciple of Xixuan Sect.

154
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:28,320
He is very powerful.

155
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:30,770
Rumor has it that

156
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:33,980
Ji Ruochen, a banished god of Xixuan Sect, has left the mountain.

157
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:35,310
Could it be him?

158
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:38,340
No wonder he didn't dare to reveal his identity.

159
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:40,140
He was afraid of being recognized.

160
00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:47,700
That boy

161
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:49,920
is really cunning.

162
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:51,740
Great Ancestor.

163
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:54,810
Aren't you in the prison of Haofang?

164
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:57,040
Don't misunderstand me.

165
00:09:57,710 --> 00:09:58,990
I'm here today

166
00:09:59,210 --> 00:10:00,290
on behalf of the Imperial Advisor

167
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:01,270
to invite you

168
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,950
to kill Ji Ruochen.

169
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:05,820
Following the order of the Imperial Advisor?

170
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:07,680
Great Ancestor.

171
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:11,110
You have deep grudges against Xixuan Sect.

172
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:14,180
We don't want to get involved in this.

173
00:10:15,650 --> 00:10:17,870
Chief Li, don't make excuses.

174
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:19,220
Your men

175
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,250
were injured by Ji Ruochen.

176
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:22,810
You should avenge them.

177
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:26,750
Besides, Ji Ruochen has many powerful weapons.

178
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:28,850
They are treasures of Xixuan Sect.

179
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:30,580
If he dies,

180
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,570
the treasures won't have an owner.

181
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:34,330
I've learned that

182
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:36,240
he has

183
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:39,100
the Wenwang Landscape Tripod.

184
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:41,650
That's the most important treasure of Xixuan Sect.

185
00:10:42,490 --> 00:10:44,210
Ziwei is so generous.

186
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:46,210
He even gave him this.

187
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,530
Chief Li. What do you think?

188
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:58,100
Where did you meet Ji Ruochen?

189
00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:04,710
Look. We are here.

190
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,700
Why did you bring me here?

191
00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:08,400
To repay your kindness.

192
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:09,830
Repay my kindness?

193
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:11,160
Uncle said

194
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,790
I must repay others' kindness and take revenge on bad guys.

195
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,040
You saved my life yesterday.

196
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:15,090
Of course I have to repay you.

197
00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:26,950
As the saying goes,

198
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,800
a drop of water shall be returned with a burst of spring.

199
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:30,590
Take it as a thank-you.

200
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:32,240
Who told you

201
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:33,300
to repay others' kindness like this?

202
00:11:38,050 --> 00:11:40,110
Should I use more water?

203
00:11:41,810 --> 00:11:43,210
How about using

204
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:44,170
all the water here?

205
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:48,020
Ji Ruochen, I finally found you.

206
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:54,270
What?

207
00:11:54,650 --> 00:11:55,980
Didn't I make you suffer yesterday?

208
00:11:56,190 --> 00:11:57,690
You brought so many men today.

209
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:58,030
You...

210
00:11:58,460 --> 00:11:59,310
You are too arrogant.

211
00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:00,990
Don't think you can do whatever you want,

212
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:02,190
because you are the Ultimate Banished God.

213
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:05,180
I'll beat you up today.

214
00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:33,860
Who are you?

215
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:35,150
You're so powerful.

216
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:38,220
I'm Great Ancestor

217
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:40,470
of Jinguang Cave.

218
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:42,580
You.

219
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:45,350
You asked the 16 evil sects to hunt me.

220
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:46,820
I tried to hide from you.

221
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:48,640
I didn't expect to meet you in the end.

222
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:51,340
I should thank you, Mr. Ji.

223
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:52,960
If it weren't for you,

224
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:55,210
I wouldn't have gotten out of the prison.

225
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:58,570
In order to prevent me from being imprisoned again,

226
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:01,110
Mr. Ji,

227
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:02,600
you should die.

228
00:13:19,810 --> 00:13:20,730
They escaped again.

229
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:22,860
He can't go far with that demon.

230
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:23,530
Go after them.

231
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:32,190
Here.

232
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:39,650
They all left.

233
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:46,220
Strange.

234
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:48,810
Why did my demonic energy disappear suddenly?

235
00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:50,530
I don't know how to hide it.

236
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:52,660
I can.

237
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:03,170
Yinyin.

238
00:14:05,650 --> 00:14:06,130
Yinyin.

239
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:07,020
Ji.

240
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:08,450
You have a pretty girl

241
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:09,580
accompanying you.

242
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,010
You're really lucky.

243
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:13,360
This lady is so beautiful,

244
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:15,310
but fierce.

245
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:17,580
I'm fierce?

246
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:19,890
You haven't seen me being fierce.

247
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:21,780
Ji Ruochen.

248
00:14:22,130 --> 00:14:22,820
I'm asking you.

249
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:23,580
Who is this?

250
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:25,560
She...

251
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:27,210
I was wrong about you.

252
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:31,130
Senior Yinyin.

253
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:32,490
Let me explain.

254
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:34,710
I just met Qingyi halfway.

255
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:36,290
I don't have a relationship with her.

256
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:37,380
Fine.

257
00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:39,600
Even if there is nothing between you two,

258
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:41,000
how do you explain you leaving the mountain?

259
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:42,220
Did you tell me when you left?

260
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:44,730
I did.

261
00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:47,060
I went to the Taixuan Palace when I left.

262
00:14:47,090 --> 00:14:47,930
But your mom...

263
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:50,620
What should I say to make you believe me?

264
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:52,740
Make me believe?

265
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,210
I have an idea.

266
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:09,710
Do you love me or not?

267
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:13,350
I always love Zhang Yinyin.

268
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:15,540
After I left the mountain,

269
00:15:15,810 --> 00:15:17,970
I missed her day and night.

270
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:32,470
Senior Yinyin.

271
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:34,830
I'm at the foot of Xixuan Mountains.

272
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:36,880
How are you?

273
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:38,900
Are you surprised

274
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:40,000
to receive my paper crane?

275
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:42,680
You are not mad at me, right?

276
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:45,010
Have you eaten on time lately?

277
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:46,680
Do you still have a headache?

278
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:49,950
When you left the Eagle Mouth Cliff that day,

279
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:51,580
I searched all over Xixuan Mountains,

280
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:52,490
but I couldn't find you.

281
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:54,440
Where did you hide?

282
00:15:56,190 --> 00:15:56,870
Senior Yinyin.

283
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:58,670
If I make you angry again,

284
00:15:59,000 --> 00:15:59,850
just flick my forehead.

285
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,280
Flick it till you're not angry.

286
00:16:04,590 --> 00:16:05,360
Senior.

287
00:16:06,850 --> 00:16:07,800
I'm worried about you.

288
00:16:09,490 --> 00:16:10,240
I miss you.

289
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:22,720
So

290
00:16:23,370 --> 00:16:24,720
you've been thinking about me.

291
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:27,820
Nerd, come here.

292
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:06,650
You...

293
00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:10,119
This fierce lady is so strange.

294
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:13,119
You hated him so much just now,

295
00:17:13,619 --> 00:17:15,069
but now you're kissing him.

296
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:17,700
Don't you know

297
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:18,790
what I mean by kissing him?

298
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,380
Stop pretending.

299
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:23,470
Let me see who you are and what you want.

300
00:17:23,859 --> 00:17:24,589
What?

301
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:36,510
The secret technique of the Heavenly Fox.

302
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:38,500
So you're a fox demon.

303
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:40,220
Strange.

304
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:42,590
How come the secret technique of the Heavenly Fox didn't work on her?

305
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:50,400
Luckily,

306
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:51,780
no one found out.

307
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:53,070
If those immortality cultivators

308
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:53,980
know you're a fox demon,

309
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:54,990
you will be in trouble.

310
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:57,730
After I came to the mortal world,

311
00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:00,000
I found that the mortal world is so unfriendly to demons.

312
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:02,440
You have a mortal body,

313
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:03,500
but you practiced demon techniques.

314
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:05,700
You must have had a hard time.

315
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:08,810
Fierce Lady.

316
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:10,490
You haven't answered my question.

317
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:11,950
Why did you kiss him?

318
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:12,840
Do you like him?

319
00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:15,430
Why do you have so many questions?

320
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:16,220
I'm warning you.

321
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:18,180
Don't tell anyone that I kissed him.

322
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:18,940
And

323
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:20,720
don't call me Fierce Lady.

324
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:21,650
My name is Zhang Yinyin.

325
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:27,870
Senior Yinyin.

326
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:28,590
Enough.

327
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:29,870
Stop pretending to be pitiful.

328
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:31,470
I'll forgive you for now.

329
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:32,310
Really?

330
00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:33,630
Of course.

331
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:34,670
Don't worry.

332
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:35,870
Miss Zhang is very nice.

333
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:38,540
Well.

334
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:40,560
Qingyi, after it's done,

335
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:41,680
you can go back, right?

336
00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:42,510
-No. -No.

337
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:46,290
No?

338
00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:47,860
Yinyin,

339
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:50,610
when did you become so generous?

340
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:52,720
I just like this little green snake.

341
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:53,500
I want to take her with me.

342
00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:54,330
Is there a problem?

343
00:18:55,190 --> 00:18:56,530
Going to Haofang is part of my plan.

344
00:18:56,830 --> 00:18:58,190
And I want to follow Miss Zhang.

345
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:01,940
You women are so weird.

346
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:03,350
You were enemies one minute before. But now you are friends.

347
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:04,760
Fine.

348
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:07,330
But the 16 evil sects

349
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:09,470
have blocked our way to Haofang.

350
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:11,250
The only shortcut we can take

351
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,180
is the Netherworld.

352
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:15,310
The Netherworld?

353
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:16,550
No, no, no.

354
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:17,990
There are many big demons there.

355
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:19,000
It's dangerous.

356
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:21,140
You can either go with us to the Netherworld

357
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:22,440
or go back by yourself.

358
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:23,050
It's up to you.

359
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:27,370
I'll listen to you.

360
00:19:31,010 --> 00:19:31,750
Look at you.

361
00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:33,030
Why

362
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:34,180
is there dust on your face?

363
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:35,860
A lot of dust?

364
00:19:37,090 --> 00:19:38,360
I just wiped it off. Let's go.

365
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:40,480
Okay, let's go.

366
00:19:55,690 --> 00:19:56,230
How did it go?

367
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:57,550
I've found out.

368
00:19:57,970 --> 00:19:59,250
If Bluestone God wants to go to Haofang,

369
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,500
she must pass through this bamboo forest.

370
00:20:00,890 --> 00:20:02,290
She is on her way.

371
00:20:02,730 --> 00:20:04,370
She'll arrive here tonight at the latest.

372
00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:05,110
Good.

373
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:06,660
We'll ambush here.

374
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:08,520
We'll catch her off guard tonight.

375
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:09,860
If we can

376
00:20:10,050 --> 00:20:11,200
kill Bluestone God,

377
00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:13,500
Jin Shan must be in great grief.

378
00:20:13,730 --> 00:20:14,460
It makes me feel good

379
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:15,940
just by thinking of it.

380
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:16,870
In this way,

381
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:19,340
Master can rest in peace.

382
00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:22,560
I'm afraid you'll go to hell to accompany him.

383
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:23,590
Who?

384
00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:43,920
Did Yinfeng do it?

385
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:44,470
Yes.

386
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:46,760
After Gu Qing warned Yinfeng not to follow her,

387
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:48,350
Yinfeng changed his schedule.

388
00:20:48,990 --> 00:20:50,630
He always arrives at the next station before Gu Qing

389
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:52,150
to help her clear the obstacles.

390
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:54,270
Yinfeng is lovesick.

391
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:55,580
He was not allowed to follow her,

392
00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:57,640
so he secretly became her scout.

393
00:20:57,860 --> 00:20:59,590
But what's the use of that?

394
00:21:00,170 --> 00:21:01,590
I'm afraid Gu Qing doesn't know

395
00:21:01,870 --> 00:21:03,190
what happened in Evil Jade Sect.

396
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:05,190
Does it matter if

397
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:06,050
she knows or not?

398
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:08,540
If she knows, she may be grateful.

399
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:10,580
If she doesn't know, what he did is useless.

400
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:12,360
Since Gu Qing

401
00:21:12,970 --> 00:21:14,320
is troubled by love,

402
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,230
we should take advantage of it

403
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:18,010
to deal with her.

404
00:21:34,010 --> 00:21:34,470
Sir.

405
00:21:36,050 --> 00:21:36,650
Does your boat

406
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:38,450
head to Haofang?

407
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:40,170
Yes.

408
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:41,480
My boat

409
00:21:41,790 --> 00:21:43,450
heads to Shangli Town on the other side of the river.

410
00:21:43,710 --> 00:21:46,180
Haofang is on the west of Shangli Town.

411
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:49,380
Are you going to take boat?

412
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:51,380
Not today.

413
00:21:51,890 --> 00:21:52,430
The day after tomorrow.

414
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:53,420
The day after tomorrow,

415
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:55,500
a woman in green will arrive here.

416
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:56,900
You must

417
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:58,710
wait for her before you leave.

418
00:21:59,410 --> 00:22:01,360
And don't mention this to her.

419
00:22:02,650 --> 00:22:03,650
I'm afraid

420
00:22:04,130 --> 00:22:06,680
she has to wait for another day.

421
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:07,760
Why?

422
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:08,810
The day after tomorrow

423
00:22:09,210 --> 00:22:11,250
will be my wife's 70th birthday.

424
00:22:11,670 --> 00:22:13,200
My family had a deal.

425
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:14,710
We will celebrate her birthday.

426
00:22:15,050 --> 00:22:15,460
No.

427
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:17,040
She can't wait any longer.

428
00:22:17,690 --> 00:22:19,450
This place is in the middle of nowhere.

429
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:22,350
She won't have a place to rest.

430
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:24,580
You must be here waiting for her the day after tomorrow.

431
00:22:27,210 --> 00:22:28,020
God.

432
00:22:28,490 --> 00:22:29,330
Please spare my life.

433
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:30,830
Please spare my life.

434
00:22:30,870 --> 00:22:32,060
Either you'll wait for her the day after tomorrow,

435
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:33,580
or you die under my sword now.

436
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:34,850
Choose.

437
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:35,810
It's really you.

438
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:42,490
Why are you...

439
00:22:42,510 --> 00:22:43,920
I've sped up these days.

440
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:45,020
I want to see

441
00:22:45,390 --> 00:22:46,580
who is ahead of me

442
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:48,010
to kill enemies

443
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:50,330
and prepare the accommodation and food for me along the way.

444
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:53,100
I did kill

445
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,460
the men of Evil Jade Sect.

446
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:56,780
But the accommodation and food...

447
00:22:56,810 --> 00:22:58,090
Why are you pretending?

448
00:22:59,460 --> 00:22:59,940
What?

449
00:23:00,910 --> 00:23:01,760
You wanted me

450
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:03,490
to see what you did, right?

451
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:05,150
I've told you.

452
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:07,420
I won't even look at you

453
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:08,970
no matter what you do.

454
00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:11,670
Do you think

455
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:13,390
I did all those things

456
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:15,420
to please you?

457
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:18,530
So

458
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:20,540
I'm nothing different from those who admire you

459
00:23:21,310 --> 00:23:22,830
for your identity and appearance.

460
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:24,030
Isn't that the truth?

461
00:23:27,570 --> 00:23:28,160
Today,

462
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:30,770
I'll let you go

463
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:31,540
since you chased away Evil Jade Sect for me.

464
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,930
If you keep pestering me,

465
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:36,330
don't blame me for being ruthless.

466
00:23:37,550 --> 00:23:38,000
Sir.

467
00:23:38,630 --> 00:23:39,090
Let's go.

468
00:23:39,370 --> 00:23:39,790
Okay.

469
00:23:51,690 --> 00:23:52,500
Bluestone God.

470
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:54,470
Do you hate me that much?

471
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:23,390
Sir, don't panic. Go now.

472
00:24:23,550 --> 00:24:25,430
We'll be safe once we are outside the range of their arrows.

473
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:26,870
Filthy guys.

474
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:28,760
I thought I killed all men of Evil Jade Sect.

475
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:30,730
You arrogant brat.

476
00:24:31,170 --> 00:24:32,990
First, you got involved in what's between Yun Zhong Ju and us.

477
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:34,670
Then you killed my seniors and juniors.

478
00:24:34,990 --> 00:24:36,830
Today, I will kill you and Bluestone God

479
00:24:37,130 --> 00:24:38,450
to avenge my seniors and juniors.

480
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:53,100
Yifeng Bird.

481
00:24:58,030 --> 00:24:58,920
The Deity Trapping Formation.

482
00:24:59,810 --> 00:25:00,880
My divine power can't be used,

483
00:25:01,290 --> 00:25:03,050
and Yifeng Bird can't be summoned.

484
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:25,340
Aren't you very powerful?

485
00:25:25,630 --> 00:25:26,410
I want to see

486
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:28,040
how you will save her

487
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:29,370
since she has been trapped.

488
00:25:29,650 --> 00:25:30,050
Retreat.

489
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:09,260
Qing.

490
00:26:09,790 --> 00:26:10,400
Qing.

491
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:23,600
Be careful.

492
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:28,490
Are you alright?

493
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:34,130
What did you call me

494
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:36,160
just now?

495
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:39,120
I was worried.

496
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:40,580
Sorry to have offended you.

497
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:42,530
If you are fine,

498
00:26:43,170 --> 00:26:43,670
I...

499
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:45,430
I'll leave.

500
00:26:49,930 --> 00:26:50,540
Are you okay?

501
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:53,140
I'm fine.

502
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:02,530
Miss Zhang.

503
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:04,540
What's wrong?

504
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:06,340
Miss Zhang.

505
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:07,590
It's dangerous.

506
00:27:07,630 --> 00:27:08,720
We should be careful.

507
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:10,820
Don't let the Demon Emperor know.

508
00:27:11,850 --> 00:27:12,900
Look how scared you are.

509
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:14,510
Fine.

510
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:16,220
Since you've been well-behaved along the way,

511
00:27:16,250 --> 00:27:17,200
I will protect you.

512
00:27:17,250 --> 00:27:17,690
Don't worry.

513
00:27:18,990 --> 00:27:19,260
Let's go.

514
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:22,710
What's there to be afraid of?

515
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:27,330
[The Netherworld]

516
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:41,760
Your Majesty,

517
00:27:42,250 --> 00:27:43,660
someone came to the Netherworld.

518
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:45,890
They look like disciples of Xixuan Sect.

519
00:27:47,450 --> 00:27:50,880
I'm afraid there is someone else.

520
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:52,310
Yes.

521
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:54,770
A girl

522
00:27:54,910 --> 00:27:56,030
is with them.

523
00:27:56,140 --> 00:27:57,160
She has strong demonic energy.

524
00:27:57,810 --> 00:27:59,010
We haven't identified her yet.

525
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:01,320
No need.

526
00:28:02,850 --> 00:28:06,260
I will never forget this energy.

527
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:08,370
Chaoxi. Jihou.

528
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:11,950
Kill

529
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,400
the two disciples of Xixuan Sect.

530
00:28:13,750 --> 00:28:15,180
As for that girl,

531
00:28:15,510 --> 00:28:17,980
bring her back safe and sound.

532
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:19,420
Got it.

533
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:23,860
It's said that the Netherworld is connected to the Heaven and the Hell.

534
00:28:24,490 --> 00:28:25,500
All demons

535
00:28:26,010 --> 00:28:27,130
gather in

536
00:28:27,370 --> 00:28:28,240
this vast area.

537
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,520
But why haven't we

538
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:31,910
seen a demon yet?

539
00:28:33,090 --> 00:28:34,700
And the scenery here is ordinary.

540
00:28:34,850 --> 00:28:35,710
There's no demon energy.

541
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:38,080
It looks like an ordinary forest.

542
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:39,430
If so,

543
00:28:39,610 --> 00:28:40,930
we need to be more careful.

544
00:28:47,510 --> 00:28:48,440
Something is coming.

545
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:55,300
Since you're in the Netherworld,

546
00:28:55,780 --> 00:28:57,160
don't expect to leave here.

547
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:19,620
Disciples of Xixuan Sect.

548
00:29:19,890 --> 00:29:21,330
How dare you come to the forbidden place of the Netherworld!

549
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:22,790
Have you forgotten

550
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:25,540
that Xixuan Sect destroyed my clan?

551
00:29:26,350 --> 00:29:27,050
The Emperor's order:

552
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:28,730
Kill them.

553
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:30,890
Be careful.

554
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:33,000
According to the Book of Immortality Cultivation,

555
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:34,700
if cultivators

556
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:36,350
come to the Netherworld,

557
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:37,770
no matter how powerful

558
00:29:38,050 --> 00:29:38,980
they are,

559
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:40,420
their power will be significantly weakened when they fight.

560
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:42,580
We have to fight even if the power has been significantly weakened.

561
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:45,030
The secret technique of the Heavenly Fox.

562
00:29:46,850 --> 00:29:47,900
The secret technique of the Heavenly Fox?

563
00:29:52,910 --> 00:29:54,830
It's just the secret technique of the five-tail Heavenly Fox.

564
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,190
Hilarious.

565
00:30:16,410 --> 00:30:17,370
Let go of me!

566
00:30:19,050 --> 00:30:19,750
Let go!

567
00:30:19,770 --> 00:30:20,390
Let her go.

568
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:21,830
Take care of yourself.

569
00:30:22,340 --> 00:30:24,040
The Demon Emperor is in the Netherworld.

570
00:30:24,230 --> 00:30:26,430
You mortals have lost much power here.

571
00:30:26,890 --> 00:30:29,000
I may not be a match for you in the mortal world.

572
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:31,690
Uncle said one must be flexible when facing an emergency.

573
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:32,960
Whatever.

574
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:08,710
Yinyin.

575
00:31:09,190 --> 00:31:09,890
What's wrong?

576
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:13,610
Mr. Ji.

577
00:31:14,070 --> 00:31:15,400
The sound will enchant demons.

578
00:31:15,570 --> 00:31:16,700
That's why she is like this.

579
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:17,700
Take her away.

580
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:19,640
Hurry, I can't hold on any longer.

581
00:31:40,650 --> 00:31:41,210
Chaoxi!

582
00:31:41,550 --> 00:31:42,050
Chaoxi!

583
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:43,300
Wake up!

584
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:48,650
That sound was strange.

585
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:49,730
I didn't expect that

586
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:50,940
both of us were enchanted by it.

587
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:52,340
They won't go far.

588
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:52,920
Go after them!

589
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:00,020
Who are they?

590
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:01,580
No matter who they are,

591
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:04,590
we can't let them make trouble in the Netherworld.

592
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:09,420
How dare you

593
00:32:09,570 --> 00:32:10,740
come to the Netherworld uninvited!

594
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:13,200
Please calm down.

595
00:32:13,870 --> 00:32:16,810
I am Great Ancestor of Jinguang Cave.

596
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:19,960
These are all from Liuxian Hall.

597
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:21,150
Today,

598
00:32:21,250 --> 00:32:22,460
we came here

599
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:25,520
because Ji Ruochen from Xixuan Sect

600
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:26,690
is in the Netherworld.

601
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:28,850
We are here to arrest him.

602
00:32:29,260 --> 00:32:30,330
Sorry to bother you.

603
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:33,620
I'm Li Zhiyao from Liuxian Hall.

604
00:32:34,650 --> 00:32:36,640
I heard that the Netherworld has deep grudges

605
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:37,900
against Xixuan Sect.

606
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:40,820
Today, disciples of Xixuan came here to cause trouble.

607
00:32:41,370 --> 00:32:42,290
If you two

608
00:32:42,430 --> 00:32:44,470
-can fight against them with us, -That's ridiculous.

609
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,480
The Netherworld

610
00:32:46,950 --> 00:32:48,330
will deal with its own enemies.

611
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:51,700
We don't need you to make trouble here.

612
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:53,020
Leave now.

613
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:54,500
And we can spare your lives.

614
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:59,680
If you two demons insist,

615
00:33:00,270 --> 00:33:03,110
don't blame us for being rude.

616
00:33:03,590 --> 00:33:04,910
How dare you!

617
00:34:02,570 --> 00:34:04,010
So you planned this.

618
00:34:04,820 --> 00:34:07,380
You invited us to look for him and come here together,

619
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:09,159
so that you can absorb souls.

620
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:12,510
Chief Li, why don't you just let it go?

621
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:14,070
By killing them,

622
00:34:14,449 --> 00:34:15,969
you just made Liuxian Hall

623
00:34:15,989 --> 00:34:17,070
an enemy of the demon clan.

624
00:34:17,730 --> 00:34:18,810
The Demon Emperor

625
00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:20,469
is a vengeful man.

626
00:34:22,580 --> 00:34:24,250
Chief Li, don't worry.

627
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:27,380
We have nothing to do with this.

628
00:34:32,350 --> 00:34:33,020
How are you?

629
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:33,840
Are you feeling better?

630
00:34:34,449 --> 00:34:35,199
I'm much better.

631
00:34:36,870 --> 00:34:37,949
We have left the Netherworld.

632
00:34:38,150 --> 00:34:38,860
The two demons

633
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:40,000
won't come after us, right?

634
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:41,900
I wonder how Qingyi is.

635
00:34:42,150 --> 00:34:43,440
She should be fine.

636
00:34:44,739 --> 00:34:45,489
I want to know

637
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:47,239
when you started practicing sorcery.

638
00:34:50,389 --> 00:34:51,280
You know?

639
00:34:52,690 --> 00:34:53,659
You've been to the Peace Hall?

640
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,000
I've become the Heavenly Fox's disciple.

641
00:34:57,450 --> 00:34:59,370
Do you know that after practicing sorcery for a long time,

642
00:34:59,390 --> 00:35:00,590
you will become a demon completely?

643
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:03,210
There is no turning back.

644
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:05,720
When did I ever want to turn back?

645
00:35:06,350 --> 00:35:07,710
I just want to defeat Gu Qing.

646
00:35:09,820 --> 00:35:10,630
I know.

647
00:35:11,030 --> 00:35:12,260
You despise me as a demon.

648
00:35:13,050 --> 00:35:14,400
I'm not as noble as Gu Qing.

649
00:35:14,430 --> 00:35:15,230
She is a fairy.

650
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:18,410
I've never despised you.

651
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:20,030
I care about you.

652
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:22,160
If you become a demon,

653
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:23,480
your life

654
00:35:23,510 --> 00:35:25,080
will be much more difficult in the future.

655
00:35:27,430 --> 00:35:28,160
Enough.

656
00:35:28,810 --> 00:35:29,850
I said something wrong.

657
00:35:32,110 --> 00:35:32,980
In that case,

658
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:35,470
give me my stuff.

659
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:38,390
What is it?

660
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:41,330
The Demon Subduing Stone bracelet.

661
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:43,860
I gave it to you

662
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:46,110
before I left the mountain, right?

663
00:35:57,660 --> 00:35:58,610
Don't take it off again.

664
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:03,140
When I am

665
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:05,240
angry with you in the future,

666
00:36:05,590 --> 00:36:06,530
I'll look at this bracelet.

667
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:07,980
And I won't be angry once I see it.

668
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:10,210
And

669
00:36:11,950 --> 00:36:12,970
thank you.

670
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:15,210
You've been thinking about me

671
00:36:15,230 --> 00:36:16,390
after you left.

672
00:36:18,110 --> 00:36:19,870
You were worried that if I had a good meal

673
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:21,450
and if I was angry.

674
00:36:22,510 --> 00:36:23,870
You kept writing to me.

675
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:30,160
Are you alright?

676
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:31,150
Qingyi, are you okay?

677
00:36:31,180 --> 00:36:32,060
Are you alright?

678
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:32,610
Yes.

679
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:38,320
Mr. Ji, we've been looking for you.

680
00:36:54,030 --> 00:36:55,170
Who are you?
