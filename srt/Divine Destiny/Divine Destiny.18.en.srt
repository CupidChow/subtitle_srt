[Episode 18]

4
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:13,720
Let him go.

5
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:20,430
If we let him go,

6
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,500
there will be future trouble.

7
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:22,850
Don't you understand

8
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:23,780
such a simple principle?

9
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:27,760
Yinfeng.

10
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:29,870
I won't let you kill him.

11
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,040
Gu Qing.

12
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,030
For a demon,

13
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:43,520
you point at me with your sword?

14
00:02:46,829 --> 00:02:48,340
I protected you for 99 lifetimes.

15
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:52,320
At this moment, for a demon,

16
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:54,310
you point at me with your sword?

17
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:09,920
Do it!

18
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:12,320
As long as you kill me,

19
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:14,900
he will live.

20
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:19,990
Do it!

21
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:32,170
Qing.

22
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,470
You have to do what you should do.

23
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,110
Kill this devil.

24
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:37,020
No!

25
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:38,040
Qing.

26
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:40,000
This is your last chance.

27
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:42,950
It's not too late to turn back now.

28
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:45,710
This is your last chance.

29
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:47,840
No!

30
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:49,110
Gu Qing.

31
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:50,940
You were wrong from the beginning.

32
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,740
The person you have always loved is me,

33
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:53,970
and can only be me.

34
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:54,470
No.

35
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:55,970
Stop being silly.

36
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:58,390
I'll go with you.

37
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:01,990
I'll go with you.

38
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:13,240
Spare his life.

39
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:19,120
I'll go back to Qingxu with you to practice the Book of Heaven

40
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:22,990
and fulfill the one hundred lifetime commitment.

41
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:42,490
Qing.

42
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:45,170
I want you to say

43
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,450
what you just said again.

44
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,190
Please spare his life.

45
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:57,460
I'll go back to Qingxu with you

46
00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:00,020
to find back my dharma-laksana

47
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,260
and return to the God Realm together.

48
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:08,610
Qing.

49
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:10,490
I knew it.

50
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,120
I knew you still love me.

51
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:34,770
Could it be him?

52
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:42,350
♫Moonlight clear as snow, my thoughts are hidden♫

53
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:46,860
♫Who plays a farewell tune in the alley♫

54
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:55,430
♫Lovesickness is like a butterfly. Floral fragrance fading away♫

55
00:05:56,440 --> 00:06:03,790
♫Robes swirling, intoxicated, dancing to a poetic verse♫

56
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:10,470
♫Moonlight bright as snow, loneliness fills the long street♫

57
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:15,030
♫Shadows remain while forms intertwine with belief♫

58
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:24,030
♫Bustling sounds vanish between branches and leaves♫

59
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:29,590
Ji Ruochen.

60
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:32,010
Ji Ruochen.

61
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:34,650
Ji Ruochen.

62
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:41,100
Who is it?

63
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:44,840
We will meet one day.

64
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:46,380
But not today.

65
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:49,960
This is not your burial place.

66
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:52,210
I'm tired.

67
00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:55,460
I want to sleep for a while.

68
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:57,700
Just for a while.

69
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,020
A man stands in heaven and earth.

70
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:01,200
He should not be afraid of death.

71
00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:03,120
But can you abandon

72
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:05,630
the one you love?

73
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:08,000
If what they said is true,

74
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:09,800
I'm a demon.

75
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:14,160
Can I still protect the people I want to protect?

76
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:18,670
Demons are all born from the mind.

77
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:22,540
You can be omnipotent if you defeat the inner demon.

78
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:25,220
Yinyin.

79
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:27,800
Ji Ruochen.

80
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:32,110
Ruochen.

81
00:07:32,690 --> 00:07:33,730
Ruochen, where are you?

82
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:34,370
Ruochen.

83
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:36,100
Ruochen.

84
00:07:36,130 --> 00:07:37,140
Ruochen.

85
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:38,810
I can't die.

86
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:40,990
I still have Yinyin.

87
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:43,560
I can't die.

88
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:46,470
Even if the Blue Fire can take somebody's soul,

89
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:49,890
it can also rebuild the spirit of the cultivator.

90
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:51,620
You are not a mortal.

91
00:07:51,909 --> 00:07:53,550
You shouldn't die.

92
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:14,260
Whether we can make it through or not

93
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,240
depends on tonight.

94
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:21,760
Sir.

95
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:25,110
Ruochen will get better.

96
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:26,840
Right?

97
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:29,520
Although I just reconnected the tendons and meridians

98
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:30,940
of the hands and feet for him,

99
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:33,780
it's impossible for him to be

100
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:36,490
as healthy as before.

101
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,919
Besides, his true essence is scattered

102
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:40,980
and his cultivation has been abolished.

103
00:08:41,530 --> 00:08:43,289
For a practitioner,

104
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:45,170
it is a disaster of epic proportions.

105
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:47,100
It was all my fault.

106
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:49,160
Why didn't I keep an eye on him?

107
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,080
It was not you

108
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:52,340
or anyone else to be blamed.

109
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:53,620
Maybe

110
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:56,430
he's destined to face this calamity.

111
00:08:57,580 --> 00:08:59,540
As the saying goes, “No destruction, no establishment.

112
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:00,790
No stopping, no progress."

113
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:03,500
I hope he can take this calamity

114
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:05,710
as an opportunity for enlightenment

115
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:07,700
to achieve some good results.

116
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:13,940
Yinyin.

117
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,770
Ruochen! Ruochen!

118
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:18,080
Ruochen, I'm here!

119
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:20,410
Ruochen.

120
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:23,650
Ruochen.

121
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:39,000
To get enlightment and achieve good results

122
00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:41,590
is not the thing I want for him.

123
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:44,440
I just want him to wake up.

124
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:48,210
As long as he wakes up,

125
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:50,010
I'm willing to do anything.

126
00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:09,640
I'm going to refine elixirs.

152
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:51,700
I know everything

153
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:53,240
was done by Yinfeng, right?

154
00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:56,480
I will avenge you

155
00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:58,440
and kill that bastard!

Ruochen!

158
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:14,490
Ji Ruochen, listen carefully.

159
00:12:15,950 --> 00:12:17,290
You must get through it.

160
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:19,840
You haven't done

161
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:20,950
what you promised me.

162
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:29,320
Didn't we agree to be together forever?

163
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:10,950
Where are you going to find Yinfeng?

164
00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:11,420
I don't know.

165
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:12,170
I'll find him eventually.

166
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:13,060
And then?

167
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:13,640
Kill him.

168
00:13:13,930 --> 00:13:14,870
Can you do that?

169
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:16,790
When Ruochen wakes up,

170
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:21,110
the first person he wants to see will be you.

171
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:30,400
It's easy to hate someone.

172
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:36,070
But it's extremely hard

173
00:13:37,810 --> 00:13:39,730
to protect someone.

174
00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:44,460
For you, there're things

175
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:48,080
more important than revenge.

176
00:13:55,450 --> 00:13:56,090
Go back.

177
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:13,960
The situation in the capital is extremely dangerous.

178
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,320
Not only did Sun Guo's Zhenwu Temple

179
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:18,450
unite with the imperial court to disadvantage the Xixuan Sect.

180
00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:19,950
I heard

181
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:21,860
the disciples of Luoran Sect

182
00:14:22,050 --> 00:14:23,980
are also seeking revenge from Senior Ruochen and Senior.

183
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:25,460
Mistress.

184
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:28,260
If the Qingxu Sect fans the flames,

185
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:30,620
the safety of Senior and the others

186
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:32,310
must be worrisome.

187
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:33,880
Su He.

188
00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:39,040
Huang Xinglan.

189
00:14:39,650 --> 00:14:40,490
Why do you come to me?

190
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:43,540
I'm here to beg you.

191
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:45,100
Beg me?

192
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:49,230
I'm a prisoner of your Xixuan Sect.

193
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:52,420
I'm your sworn enemy,

194
00:14:52,450 --> 00:14:53,730
the nine-tailed fox.

195
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:57,590
Shouldn't you be here to torture me?

196
00:14:58,420 --> 00:14:59,060
Su He.

197
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:01,800
Why do you mention the past grudges between us?

198
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:03,590
I'm here to ask you.

199
00:15:05,010 --> 00:15:06,330
Yinyin has revealed the true form

200
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:07,950
of a five-tailed fox demon on Xixuan Mountains.

201
00:15:08,130 --> 00:15:09,210
Was it related to you?

202
00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:11,080
Yes.

203
00:15:12,070 --> 00:15:14,280
I taught her the Heavenly Fox Secret Technique.

204
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:17,830
You have planted the Huanyao Root into her.

205
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:18,720
Isn't that enough?

206
00:15:19,090 --> 00:15:20,650
Why are you still torturing her?

207
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:22,490
Huang Xinglan,

208
00:15:23,470 --> 00:15:25,530
You cultivators are good at preaching profound principles.

209
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:27,700
Why can't you distinguish

210
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:29,130
right from wrong in front of me?

211
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:33,270
Your daughter came to beg me

212
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:34,430
and wanted to be my disciple.

213
00:15:35,650 --> 00:15:38,260
How did it become me who deliberately hurt her?

214
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:40,500
Why did she take you as her master?

215
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:44,250
It's all because you're useless as a mother.

216
00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:46,950
Your daughter's crush

217
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:48,480
is almost taken away by someone else.

218
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:50,980
Why didn't you help?

219
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:53,810
Fine.

220
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:56,760
Since you’re Yinyin’s master,

221
00:15:57,930 --> 00:15:59,170
and I’m Yinyin’s mother,

222
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:01,900
I have a request.

223
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:04,920
Yinyin is in a very dangerous situation.

224
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:07,980
Please protect her.

225
00:16:09,130 --> 00:16:10,120
Ridiculous.

226
00:16:11,090 --> 00:16:12,980
Why didn't you go to Ziwei

227
00:16:13,010 --> 00:16:14,140
or help her yourself?

228
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:16,330
Why are you begging me?

229
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:18,690
Now, I don't even

230
00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:21,250
know where she is now.

231
00:16:22,210 --> 00:16:23,940
And she's surrounded by strong enemies.

232
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:25,130
You're a nine-tailed fox demon.

233
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:26,300
You're capable.

234
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:29,090
If you can stay by her side,

235
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:30,440
you can protect her.

236
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:32,750
I took her as my disciple

237
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:35,130
to relieve my boredom.

238
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:37,190
As for saving her,

239
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:39,100
I'm not going to do it.

240
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:54,400
Su He.

241
00:16:55,410 --> 00:16:56,330
I beg you.

242
00:16:58,130 --> 00:16:59,330
Xixuan Sect owes you.

243
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:01,280
But my daughter is innocent.

244
00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:04,210
I beg you.

245
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:07,150
As her master,

246
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:09,369
please save her.

247
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:13,300
I didn't expect that

248
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:15,890
you Xixuan Zhenren could be so lowly.

249
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:18,290
Even if I want to save her,

250
00:17:18,819 --> 00:17:20,630
but look at me now.

251
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:23,319
Is it your daughter more pitiful

252
00:17:23,730 --> 00:17:25,130
or me?

253
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:33,070
Let me pull

254
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:35,260
the Demon Subduing Nail out.

255
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:40,910
Aren't you afraid of the rules of Xixuan Sect?

256
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:43,310
As long as Yinyin is safe,

257
00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:44,630
I'm not afraid of anything.

258
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:45,950
I can do anything.

259
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:47,040
Okay.

260
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:52,980
Yinyin.

261
00:19:54,130 --> 00:19:56,070
This is all I can do for you.

262
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:13,170
Aren't you afraid that the first thing I do when I go out

263
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:16,470
is to tear down the hall of Xixuan Sect?

264
00:20:18,570 --> 00:20:19,610
It's up to you.

265
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:24,690
I just want you to protect Yinyin.

266
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:29,160
You're indeed a good mother.

267
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:11,080
Ruochen.

268
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:16,420
Ruochen.

269
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:21,750
You're finally awake.

270
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:28,490
Mr. Ji said

271
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:31,390
as long as you can wake up tonight,

272
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:33,860
you should be fine.

273
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:38,390
What's wrong with me?

274
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:42,150
Why am I weak?

275
00:21:45,610 --> 00:21:46,770
No matter where you are hurt,

276
00:21:48,050 --> 00:21:49,840
I'll find a way to cure you.

277
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:52,540
Senior Yunfeng is refining elixirs.

278
00:21:55,170 --> 00:21:56,650
What happened?

279
00:21:58,220 --> 00:21:59,200
Tell me.

280
00:22:00,490 --> 00:22:04,510
Why can't I move?

281
00:22:05,870 --> 00:22:07,580
Where am I hurt?

282
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:10,030
Don't think too much.

283
00:22:11,390 --> 00:22:13,550
The elixir of Xixuan Sect will cure you.

284
00:22:14,290 --> 00:22:15,130
It will.

285
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:18,470
Stop lying to me.

286
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:22,120
In my current situation,

287
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:25,410
my tendons should be broken.

288
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:29,820
So what?

289
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:31,790
There will be a way.

290
00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:35,320
Don't lie to me.

291
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:38,730
I know Xixuan's elixir

292
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:42,050
can only save my life.

293
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:45,760
There's no way for someone like me whose tendons are broken

294
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:48,820
to recover, right?

295
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:50,630
No.

296
00:22:53,050 --> 00:22:54,000
No.

297
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:55,540
Trust me.

298
00:22:57,090 --> 00:22:57,660
OK?

299
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:02,910
Not bad.

300
00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:05,750
A useless person like me

301
00:23:07,450 --> 00:23:10,320
doesn't have to pretend to be a banished god anymore.

302
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:14,740
Yinfeng won't seek revenge on me.

303
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:20,990
Master won't let me face the calamity anymore.

304
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:23,290
What are you talking about?

305
00:23:23,690 --> 00:23:25,260
Stop calling yourself a useless person.

306
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:27,940
You will recover.

307
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:30,020
Don't think too much.

308
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:39,730
Get some more sleep.

309
00:23:42,490 --> 00:23:43,880
Everything will be fine after you wake up.

310
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:11,380
Demon Emperor, this is a gift from my uncle to you.

311
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:12,370
Please accept it.

312
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:18,210
Your Majesty.

313
00:24:19,210 --> 00:24:21,090
This is a rare treasure.

314
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:22,260
Of course.

315
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:24,300
It only grows in the Endless Sea.

316
00:24:24,490 --> 00:24:25,970
It takes five hundred years to grow one.

317
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:27,420
All right.

318
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:31,610
Please extend my gratitude to Master of the Endless Sea.

319
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:35,090
I wonder

320
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:37,360
what brings Miss Qingyi

321
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:38,870
to our Netherworld.

322
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:40,260
Demon Emperor, I want to ask you

323
00:24:40,670 --> 00:24:42,630
to help me find my friend.

324
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:44,110
No problem.

325
00:24:45,070 --> 00:24:46,630
Miss Qingyi's friend

326
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:49,060
is my friend.

327
00:24:49,410 --> 00:24:50,110
What's his name?

328
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:53,570
I'll send everyone in Netherworld

329
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:54,860
to find him for you.

330
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:56,110
The people I'm looking for

331
00:24:56,130 --> 00:24:58,940
are disciples of the Xixuan Sect, Ji Ruochen and Zhang Yinyin.

332
00:24:59,150 --> 00:25:01,510
I only know that they left the capital a few days ago.

333
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:02,910
They're nowhere to be found after that.

334
00:25:03,410 --> 00:25:05,420
So Demon Emperor, please help me.

335
00:25:06,470 --> 00:25:08,150
From the Xixuan Sect?

336
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:11,340
Miss Qingyi, do you know that Xixuan Sect

337
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:13,950
has a grudge against us?

338
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:15,890
Of course I know.

339
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:18,230
But

340
00:25:19,730 --> 00:25:20,950
Master ordered

341
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:23,440
to keep Mr. Ji and Miss Yinyin safe.

342
00:25:23,850 --> 00:25:25,070
So he sent me here

343
00:25:25,670 --> 00:25:27,110
to ask for your help.

344
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:31,800
Since it's an order from the Master of the Endless Sea,

345
00:25:32,270 --> 00:25:34,440
I dare not disobey.

346
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:37,730
I'll send someone to find Ji Ruochen

347
00:25:37,770 --> 00:25:38,530
and Zhang Yinyin.

348
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:41,860
Please wait for the good news.

349
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:44,140
I appreciate your help.

350
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:45,300
Thank you.

351
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:49,710
Your Majesty.

352
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:51,350
Qingyi

353
00:25:52,330 --> 00:25:54,360
is using chicken feathers as an order arrow.

354
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:57,960
How can we listen to her?

355
00:25:58,350 --> 00:26:00,360
I'll send some men

356
00:26:00,510 --> 00:26:02,230
to pretend to search

357
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:03,740
and send her away.

358
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:04,510
No.

359
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:07,270
We must look for them.

360
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:09,040
We must find them.

361
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:11,980
We haven't avenged Chaoxi and Jihou.

362
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:16,040
Xixuan Sect still owes me a blood debt.

363
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:18,140
Your Majesty, you mean

364
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:20,840
you want to kill Ji Ruochen with this?

365
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:23,650
They just asked us to look for them.

366
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:26,580
But what will happen

367
00:26:27,490 --> 00:26:29,540
if our men encounter him?

368
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:30,590
Your Majesty,

369
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:32,340
I have an idea.

370
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:32,960
Go ahead.

371
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:35,370
Zhenwu Temple is in the capital.

372
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:38,560
The surroundings are bound to be filled with Sun Guo's henchmen.

373
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:40,320
After we find Ji Ruochen,

374
00:26:40,630 --> 00:26:44,170
we just need to report his location to Sun Guo.

375
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:46,970
Then someone will

376
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:48,510
kill him for us.

377
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:49,740
Okay.

378
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:52,800
I'll leave this matter to you.

379
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:54,120
Yes, Your Majesty.

380
00:26:58,970 --> 00:27:00,010
The heat is just right.

381
00:27:00,270 --> 00:27:00,840
It's almost cooked.

382
00:27:01,310 --> 00:27:02,230
It'll be ready soon.

383
00:27:03,290 --> 00:27:03,790
Ruochen.

384
00:27:04,450 --> 00:27:05,620
Enjoying the sunshine

385
00:27:05,950 --> 00:27:06,990
is good for your health.

386
00:27:09,610 --> 00:27:10,250
Senior.

387
00:27:11,030 --> 00:27:12,240
I have taken at least

388
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:13,910
20 to 30 doses the medicine you made,

389
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:15,860
if not 50 doses.

390
00:27:16,410 --> 00:27:18,380
Why is it still not working?

391
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:20,630
I can't even scratch myself.

392
00:27:21,870 --> 00:27:22,420
Are you itchy?

393
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:23,610
Where?

394
00:27:23,990 --> 00:27:24,800
Let me scratch it for you.

395
00:27:26,970 --> 00:27:27,860
Mr. Ji said

396
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:29,450
your tendons were reconnected.

397
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:32,190
You need to take your time to recuperate.

398
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:34,480
Don't be too hasty.

399
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:37,780
Tell me the truth.

400
00:27:38,470 --> 00:27:41,370
Am I not just having my tendons completely broken?

401
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:46,590
Stop lying to me.

402
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:47,980
Two days ago,

403
00:27:48,170 --> 00:27:50,140
I tried to use the primordial energy in my body

404
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:51,540
and I discovered that my dantian is completely empty.

405
00:27:51,910 --> 00:27:52,890
I couldn't move it at all.

406
00:27:54,390 --> 00:27:56,270
It seems that I've lost all my cultivation.

407
00:27:58,180 --> 00:27:58,740
Don't think too much.

408
00:28:01,170 --> 00:28:04,290
I've been on Xixuan Mountains for years.

409
00:28:04,930 --> 00:28:06,280
I still failed

410
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:08,650
my master's cultivation and teaching.

411
00:28:11,050 --> 00:28:12,090
What are you talking about?

412
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:14,940
This is not what Xixuan disciples should say.

413
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:24,640
It's nothing after thinking about it.

414
00:28:25,450 --> 00:28:27,370
It was just a waste of time.

415
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:29,910
In the end, I came back to square one.

416
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:32,580
I'm just a Ji Clerk.

417
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:36,160
Instead of constantly thinking about cultivating immortality and achieving enlightenment,

418
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:37,990
I'd better listen to Huaniang.

419
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:40,070
Isn't it good to just knock on the fat sheep?

420
00:28:47,170 --> 00:28:48,630
But on the other hand,

421
00:28:49,290 --> 00:28:50,470
if it weren't for this,

422
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,030
I wouldn’t have known Yinyin.

423
00:28:52,750 --> 00:28:54,640
I think it’s worth it.

424
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:01,300
Wanwan, stop running.

425
00:29:02,630 --> 00:29:04,510
Isn't it just that I want to milk you?

426
00:29:05,210 --> 00:29:06,480
Why are you running?

427
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:07,480
Be careful.

428
00:29:07,530 --> 00:29:07,940
Be careful.

429
00:29:07,970 --> 00:29:08,440
Come back!

430
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:09,990
If you keep running,

431
00:29:10,010 --> 00:29:10,720
I'll roast you.

432
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:11,930
It can also replenish Ruochen's health.

433
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:12,920
Stop! Stop!

434
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,090
It's foggy in Qingxu Mountain.

435
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:09,700
It's not as comfortable as staying in Yun Zhong Ju.

436
00:30:10,030 --> 00:30:11,050
Be careful not to catch a cold.

437
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:15,180
Now that you've lost your immortal dharma-laksana.

438
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:16,840
It will be different from before

439
00:30:17,250 --> 00:30:18,210
when youI practice the seven volumes of the Book of Heaven.

440
00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:20,310
Don't worry too much.

441
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:25,750
I have you.

442
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:27,970
There's nothing to worry about.

443
00:30:29,470 --> 00:30:29,980
Qing.

444
00:30:30,970 --> 00:30:31,810
You have no idea

445
00:30:32,290 --> 00:30:35,480
how long I've been waiting for this day.

446
00:30:44,810 --> 00:30:45,590
Two fairies.

447
00:30:47,990 --> 00:30:48,510
What is it?

448
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:49,790
Two fairies.

449
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:51,000
Hierarch said

450
00:30:51,030 --> 00:30:52,310
he wants to go to Yun Zhong Ju.

451
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:54,360
He wants to invite you and Fairy Gu to go with him.

452
00:30:57,580 --> 00:30:58,640
I don't want to go anywhere.

453
00:31:00,990 --> 00:31:01,990
You can do whatever you want.

454
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:03,310
Everything is up to you.

455
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:06,170
But since Hierarch invites us,

456
00:31:07,010 --> 00:31:07,740
I'll go and come back soon.

457
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:11,650
Why are you going to Yun Zhong Ju?

458
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:13,110
Gu Qing joined Qingxu.

459
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:15,150
As the Hierarch of Qingxu,

460
00:31:15,430 --> 00:31:17,670
I have to explain it to the Jin Shan of Yun Zhong Ju.

461
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:19,140
If he knows

462
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:20,770
you are the real banished god,

463
00:31:20,910 --> 00:31:23,280
he should cut ties with Xixuan Sect as well.

464
00:31:23,830 --> 00:31:25,030
Gu Qing is my guest.

465
00:31:25,650 --> 00:31:27,060
When did she join your sect?

466
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:29,720
I think you just want to

467
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:32,100
persuade Yun Zhong Ju to deal with Xixuan Sect together.

468
00:31:34,990 --> 00:31:36,630
The Imperial Advisor is working with all sects

469
00:31:36,970 --> 00:31:37,840
to conquer Xixuan.

470
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:40,670
If Yun Zhong Ju and Qingxu can help the Imperial Advisor together,

471
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:42,460
Xixuan Sect will surely lose.

472
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:44,910
Gu Qing and I have to practice the Book of Heaven.

473
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:46,260
We have no time to deal with other things.

474
00:31:47,150 --> 00:31:48,430
As for the trip to Yun Zhong Ju,

475
00:31:49,570 --> 00:31:50,380
I don't think it's necessary.

476
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:53,060
Ji Ruochen wanted to kill you

477
00:31:53,370 --> 00:31:54,950
and replaced you as the banished god.

478
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:56,660
It's a good chance for you

479
00:31:56,660 --> 00:31:58,850
to expose Ji Ruochen and Xixuan Sect

480
00:31:59,150 --> 00:32:00,400
and let the world see

481
00:32:00,610 --> 00:32:02,690
the real intention of Xixuan Sect.

482
00:32:02,890 --> 00:32:04,360
How can you stay out of this?

483
00:32:06,970 --> 00:32:08,310
I deprived Ji Ruochen's cultivation.

484
00:32:09,130 --> 00:32:10,150
I've settled my grudge with him.

485
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:12,500
I don't want to get involved in mortal affairs anymore.

486
00:32:12,930 --> 00:32:15,170
As for the dispute between Xixuan and Qingxu,

487
00:32:15,770 --> 00:32:16,700
you can deal with it yourselves.

488
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:17,390
You...

489
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:21,240
Senior.

490
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:23,080
How could Yinfeng

491
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:25,290
be so indifferent on such important matter?

492
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:26,940
He looks like he has nothing to do with it.

493
00:32:27,860 --> 00:32:28,660
Don't worry.

494
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:30,620
He's an immortal after all.

495
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:32,500
If the Three Realms are really in chaos,

496
00:32:33,030 --> 00:32:34,920
I don't believe that he and Gu Qing will stand by and watch.

497
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:36,050
You mean

498
00:32:36,730 --> 00:32:39,050
the Shenzhou Energy Map in Xixuan Sect?

499
00:32:39,650 --> 00:32:40,210
Yes.

500
00:32:40,870 --> 00:32:41,780
Any sect

501
00:32:41,810 --> 00:32:43,620
who gets the Shenzhou Energy Map

502
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:44,700
won't be able to hold back.

503
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:46,730
Qingxu only needs to proceed gradually

504
00:32:46,810 --> 00:32:47,560
and act step by step.

505
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:50,120
Just wait for Xixuan Sect to expose themselves.

506
00:33:07,170 --> 00:33:08,650
If my true essence is dispersed,

507
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:09,940
and my cultivation is ruined,

508
00:33:10,970 --> 00:33:12,570
will I be no longer a demon?

509
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:14,950
Doesn't the idea of

510
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:16,540
being born to save the Three Realms

511
00:33:17,310 --> 00:33:18,940
through calamity also collapse on its own?

512
00:33:41,810 --> 00:33:43,580
But even if I'm not the banished god

513
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:44,550
mentioned by people,

514
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:47,510
I still need to protect someone.

515
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:50,100
There's a person whom I want to give happiness to

516
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:52,820
and protect forever.

517
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:58,420
How are you, Ruochen?

518
00:34:58,900 --> 00:34:59,700
Don't come over.

519
00:35:00,470 --> 00:35:01,520
I can do it myself.

520
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:40,190
Looks like your hands are much better.

521
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:42,590
Senior Yunfeng's elixir is indeed amazing.

522
00:35:43,050 --> 00:35:43,570
Yes.

523
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:45,550
I'm much better now.

524
00:35:51,550 --> 00:35:52,860
Did I wake you up?

525
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:54,670
No.

526
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:58,450
I just thought Wanwan might be hungry,

527
00:35:58,660 --> 00:35:59,380
so I came to see it.

528
00:35:59,990 --> 00:36:00,430
Wanwan.

529
00:36:00,750 --> 00:36:01,560
Eat more.

530
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:06,790
Yinyin.

531
00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:08,610
Do you want to go back to Xixuan Mountains?

532
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:16,060
I do miss my parents,

533
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:17,800
Qiushui and Xuanzhen.

534
00:36:20,620 --> 00:36:21,900
Then let's go back.

535
00:36:24,270 --> 00:36:24,840
No.

536
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:26,620
Why not?

537
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:31,300
Is it because of the Heavenly Fox Secret Technique?

538
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:34,190
There's always a way to solve this.

539
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:35,810
Besides,

540
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:38,050
when I left Xixuan Mountains,

541
00:36:38,290 --> 00:36:39,860
Master left me a message.

542
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:41,610
I know what he thinks.

543
00:36:42,220 --> 00:36:43,400
There's really a solution.

544
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:49,140
Then why?

545
00:36:49,430 --> 00:36:50,430
Is it because of me?

546
00:36:51,380 --> 00:36:53,370
Is it because I'm useless now

547
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:55,860
that you're afraid that they will laugh at me

548
00:36:56,250 --> 00:36:57,400
or bully me?

549
00:36:57,670 --> 00:36:58,580
I'll see who dares.

550
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:04,960
I just want to be with you now.

551
00:37:05,860 --> 00:37:07,110
I don't want to be separated from you again.

552
00:37:07,930 --> 00:37:08,860
Come, sit down.

553
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:17,560
We can go to a place

554
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:19,610
where no one knows us

555
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:20,610
and start over.

556
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:23,190
I don't want to get involved

557
00:37:23,210 --> 00:37:24,370
in disputes any more.

558
00:37:25,090 --> 00:37:25,850
I don't want Master

559
00:37:25,870 --> 00:37:27,470
to order you to do this and that.

560
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,250
Let those sects who plotted against you

561
00:37:30,510 --> 00:37:31,390
go to hell.

562
00:37:32,930 --> 00:37:33,630
You're right.

563
00:37:33,950 --> 00:37:35,630
Let them go to hell.

564
00:37:38,230 --> 00:37:39,440
We can go outside the border

565
00:37:40,450 --> 00:37:42,220
to the place where I first met you.

566
00:37:43,170 --> 00:37:43,980
By then,

567
00:37:44,430 --> 00:37:46,670
you'll be the boss and I'll be the boss lady.

568
00:37:47,910 --> 00:37:51,140
You'll be responsible for cooking, carrying water, serveing tables

569
00:37:51,510 --> 00:37:52,260
and knocking on the fat sheep.

570
00:37:55,580 --> 00:37:56,510
After all the talking,

571
00:37:57,290 --> 00:37:58,830
you're still going to open an illegal shop?

572
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:01,040
We have to make it clear.

573
00:38:01,620 --> 00:38:04,080
I'll be in charge of the accounts.

574
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:05,580
Sure.

575
00:38:06,610 --> 00:38:07,970
You can be in charge of anything.

576
00:38:08,020 --> 00:38:09,890
You can decide anything.

577
00:38:10,050 --> 00:38:11,340
But there is one thing

578
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:12,800
you must promise me.

579
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:16,330
Give birth to three chubby babies for me.

580
00:38:16,950 --> 00:38:17,280
You...

581
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:18,820
Two.

582
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:19,860
-You...
-One.

583
00:38:20,430 --> 00:38:21,460
You took advantage of me.

584
00:38:22,130 --> 00:38:22,650
Yinyin.

585
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:29,030
Are you okay?

586
00:38:31,130 --> 00:38:31,840
I'm fine.

587
00:38:32,430 --> 00:38:33,110
Are you okay?

588
00:38:35,350 --> 00:38:36,230
It's a deal then.

589
00:38:36,490 --> 00:38:37,730
Give birth to one chubby baby for me.

590
00:38:37,910 --> 00:38:39,240
-No regrets.
-What are you talking about?

591
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:44,600
♫With flowers and leaves in this mortal world♫

592
00:38:45,110 --> 00:38:50,120
♫I understand the entanglement and obsession♫

593
00:38:50,790 --> 00:38:55,820
♫With smiles and words in this life♫

594
00:38:56,490 --> 00:39:00,410
♫I wish time could stand still♫

595
00:39:00,450 --> 00:39:03,210
♫So that I can always keep you with me♫

596
00:39:03,230 --> 00:39:07,190
♫With strings and swords in this mortal world♫

597
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:13,130
♫I'm willing to let go but I hate time♫

598
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:18,360
♫The moon is always full and the sea will dry♫
