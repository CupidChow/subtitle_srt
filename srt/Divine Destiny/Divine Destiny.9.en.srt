[Divine Destiny]

3
00:01:35,789 --> 00:01:38,000
[Episode 9]

4
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:38,870
Come on.

5
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:42,640
You monster. Where do you want to escape?

6
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:46,990
Miss Zhang.

7
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:51,500
You old monk.

8
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:52,509
How dare you come here!

9
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:53,759
Do you know what this place is?

10
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:56,680
Hui Garden is where His Highness receives important guests.

11
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:57,780
Get lost!

12
00:01:57,990 --> 00:01:59,430
After I arrest you,

13
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:00,950
I'll report it to His Highness.

14
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:08,419
Mr. Ji.

15
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,360
The wine tastes good.

16
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:13,590
I'm a disciple of Xixuan.

17
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:14,710
Aren't you afraid that Xixuan Sect

18
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:15,810
will burn down your Nanhai Temple?

19
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:16,600
Take them away.

20
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:20,380
Old monk, untie me!

21
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,680
I'll show you what I'm capable of.

22
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:23,040
Let go of me!

23
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,829
Old monk, let go of me!

24
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:33,190
Ruochen.

25
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:33,780
Mr. Ji.

26
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:37,950
I'm Ji Ruochen.

27
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:39,630
I hope Master Huihai can release them.

28
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:40,590
Mr. Ji.

29
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:43,870
You were enchanted by the two monsters.

30
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:46,600
I'm helping you.

31
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:48,210
Don't listen to him.

32
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,420
Just cut the chain.

33
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:55,220
Mr. Ji.

34
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:57,670
Don't make another mistake.

35
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:23,710
You are selfish.

36
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:25,190
Yes. So what?

37
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,829
I heard that Xixuan Sect is unreasonable.

38
00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:30,720
Now I've learned it.

39
00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:33,140
Next time I meet you,

40
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:35,130
you won't be so lucky.

41
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:36,670
Let's go.

42
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:39,190
If I see you again,

43
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:40,950
I'll shave your eyebrows.

44
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:45,150
This is not fun.

45
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:47,290
They came aggressively,

46
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:50,300
but left like stray dogs.

47
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:51,740
Not funny.

48
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:52,220
I'm leaving.

49
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:53,730
Mr. Ji.

50
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:55,770
Since you're here, stay.

51
00:03:58,390 --> 00:03:59,500
I need to

52
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:01,890
think about it.

53
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:09,360
Mother.

54
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:11,850
Miss Zhang.

55
00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:16,600
Do you know why I slapped you?

56
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:19,230
Yes.

57
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:25,400
I left Xixuan Mountains without permission and came to Haofang.

58
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:29,420
But I didn't do anything wrong.

59
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:31,050
You didn't do anything wrong?

60
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:33,860
Huihai almost caught you.

61
00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:35,650
You and dad are in Haofang.

62
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:37,590
Why didn't you come out and help

63
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:38,650
when you knew Ruochen and I were in trouble?

64
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:45,130
It is the hierarch's order.

65
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:48,300
Ruochen is the Ultimate Banished God.

66
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:51,100
He will survive the calamity.

67
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:54,220
This is also a good way for him to restore his divine power.

68
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:55,790
Yinyin.

69
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:58,950
I'll ask someone to send you back to Xixuan Mountains today.

70
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:00,230
No.

71
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:02,620
You can leave him to die.

72
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:04,100
But I can't leave Ruochen

73
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:05,950
alone in Haofang.

74
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:14,960
Yinyin.

75
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,790
You just don't give up on Ji Ruochen.

76
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:24,930
Ji Ruochen.

77
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:27,330
When you left Xixuan Mountains,

78
00:05:27,890 --> 00:05:29,600
did Senior Ziyang tell you that

79
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:31,330
when you make a triumphant return,

80
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:34,450
he'll let you marry Fairy Gu?

81
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:36,659
Did you refuse him without hesitation?

82
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:41,659
I've heard about it.

83
00:05:42,890 --> 00:05:43,830
Don't lie.

84
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:50,890
No.

85
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:52,409
But I...

86
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:52,990
Ji Ruochen.

87
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:57,260
Do you think your plan is clever?

88
00:05:57,940 --> 00:05:58,780
I know.

89
00:05:59,010 --> 00:06:00,250
Senior Ziyang also knows.

90
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,560
That's why he mentioned the marriage again.

91
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:04,930
He wanted to warn you.

92
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:07,220
Ji Ruochen.

93
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:10,120
You must marry her,

94
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,720
unless you die in Haofang.

95
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:17,280
Madam.

96
00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:18,280
Ji Ruochen.

97
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:23,390
Yinyin is my only daughter.

98
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:26,200
I don't want her to

99
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:27,810
spend the rest of her life in pain.

100
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:30,670
I'm begging you.

101
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:33,460
Since you can't run away from your divine destiny,

102
00:06:33,659 --> 00:06:35,010
please give up your mortal destiny

103
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:36,920
and let Yinyin go.

104
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:38,470
I'm begging you.

105
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:32,680
Madam,

106
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:38,500
I can promise you

107
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:41,300
I won't let Yinyin down.

108
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:43,460
I will protect her.

109
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:46,600
I will really protect her.

110
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:54,110
Ji Ruochen,

111
00:07:56,090 --> 00:07:57,530
this is your promise to me.

112
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:01,050
If you hurt Yinyin,

113
00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:05,410
don't blame me for being heartless.

114
00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:12,620
Yinyin.

115
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:15,420
Yinyin, aren't we going to wait for Mr. Ji?

116
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:16,580
Wait for him if you want.

117
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:17,860
This...

118
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:20,140
Festive lanterns. Have a look.

119
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:22,380
Why didn't you wait for me?

120
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:29,960
Go find your divine destiny.

121
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:31,450
Why are you getting in my way here?

122
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:33,820
Yinyin.

123
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:36,059
I thought you didn't like him going to Fairy Gu.

124
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:37,270
Why are you asking him to go to her?

125
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:41,179
Is this what people in the mortal world

126
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,240
calls breaking a promise?

127
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:43,860
Don't you want to hear

128
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:46,350
what I just told your mother?

129
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:49,100
What you said is between you and her.

130
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:50,280
It has nothing to do with me.

131
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:51,520
I want to know.

132
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:54,420
Yinyin. Yinyin.

133
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:55,640
I want to know.

134
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:57,220
-I want to know.
-Shut up.

135
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:00,780
Fine. If you don't want to hear it,

136
00:09:01,090 --> 00:09:01,930
let's go back.

137
00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:03,100
Let's go.

138
00:09:05,330 --> 00:09:06,380
You fool.

139
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:08,580
Are you really not going to tell me because I didn't let you say?

140
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:10,500
When did you become so obedient?

141
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:12,990
Don't use your monster arts.

142
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:14,310
We just escaped from Huihai.

143
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,710
The monster energy will attract him here.

144
00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:17,540
If you want to know,

145
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:18,440
I'll tell you.

146
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:20,010
Then what are you waiting for?

147
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:21,670
Tell me.

148
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:25,310
I said

149
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:27,670
I would never let you down.

150
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:32,700
How are you going to fulfill your promise?

151
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:34,110
Tell me.

152
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:37,930
You'll know when I eliminate the monster.

153
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:41,250
Tell me now.

154
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:42,520
I want to hear it now.

155
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:45,110
What should I say?

156
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:47,580
Are you going to tell me or not?

157
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:50,790
If you don't tell me, I'll leave.

158
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:00,990
Let's go.

159
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:03,670
Yinyin.

160
00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:05,520
Aren't we going with Mr. Ji?

161
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,480
Miss Zhang, what's wrong?

162
00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:11,520
I just feel a little upset

163
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:12,430
because I am no match for that old monk.

164
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:14,790
Then you should be upset.

165
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:16,190
You won't be able to defeat him anyway.

166
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:16,820
You...

167
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:23,880
Yinyin.

168
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:26,310
I'll tell you after I fight with Bamboo Snake.

169
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:48,980
Your Highness, leave now.

170
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:50,310
Why are you panicking?

171
00:10:50,890 --> 00:10:51,570
The Imperial Advisor said

172
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:53,180
as long as the people are here,

173
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:55,680
they can protect me from calamities.

174
00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:00,950
Wait. Where is Xichen?

175
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:02,220
She should be with the Imperial Advisor.

176
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:06,520
Your Highness.

177
00:11:06,610 --> 00:11:07,570
Let's get in the carriage first.

178
00:11:22,530 --> 00:11:25,450
Unfortunately, Huihai and Liu Yechuan are useless.

179
00:11:26,090 --> 00:11:28,330
They couldn't control Ji Ruochen.

180
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:31,240
He escaped again.

181
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:32,820
Calm down.

182
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:35,440
I've sent someone to keep an eye on Ji Ruochen.

183
00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:37,830
Once he discovers where the demon is,

184
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:41,000
I'll send troops to ambush them immediately.

185
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:45,740
When the demon and Ji Ruochen are both injured,

186
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:49,330
I will take the treasure from the demon

187
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:52,540
and kill Ji Ruochen.

188
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,390
Impressive.

189
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:08,270
Master.

190
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:09,580
Junior masters.

191
00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:10,780
Master.

192
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:13,380
According to your order, Qiushui, Xuanzhen, and the others

193
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:16,170
have set out to Haofang to help Ruochen eliminate the demon.

194
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:21,020
Mr. Ji.

195
00:12:22,090 --> 00:12:22,850
You're still here.

196
00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:25,960
Did you get drunk

197
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:27,830
so that the King of Haofang forgot to take you when he ran?

198
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:29,570
What are you talking about?

199
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:32,370
I wouldn't leave even if he took me with him.

200
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:33,960
The demon is coming.

201
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:37,660
It's safer to be with Ji Ruochen.

202
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:39,090
You are smart.

203
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:40,330
Ruochen.

204
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:46,740
Why is he here?

205
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:51,690
I'm Yinfeng from Qingxu Sect.

206
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:53,520
Fairy Gu asked me to help you kill the demon.

207
00:12:54,170 --> 00:12:54,690
Look.

208
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:56,380
A banished god is a banished god.

209
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,840
Fairy Gu is more respected.

210
00:12:58,110 --> 00:12:59,860
At this moment, someone is still willing to help us.

211
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:03,680
Thank you, Yinfeng.

212
00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:08,790
The demonic energy is overwhelming, and the fire is everywhere.

213
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,190
The demon is about to show up.

214
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:11,670
Senior Qiushui.

215
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:13,990
Take this token and go to

216
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:16,170
the military camp in the city with Xuanzhen and Senior Bingxian.

217
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,540
Send as many soldiers as you can

218
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,740
to help the people who haven't been evacuated.

219
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,230
If anyone stops you,

220
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:23,320
kill him.

221
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:24,630
OK.

222
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:26,070
Bye.

223
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:27,220
Let's go.

224
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:29,780
Fairy Gu.

225
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:31,610
You and Yinfeng

226
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:33,730
continue to patrol in the west of the city.

227
00:13:34,430 --> 00:13:36,400
Priests, you patrol outside the city.

228
00:13:37,330 --> 00:13:37,640
OK.

229
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:39,340
I'll go with Senior Yinyin.

230
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:41,030
Who wants to go with you?

231
00:13:41,710 --> 00:13:42,810
I'd better go with Qingyi.

232
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:45,750
Huihai wanted to catch you yesterday.

233
00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:47,270
I don't know who will come today.

234
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:48,300
Of course it's safer

235
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:48,950
for you to be with me.

236
00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:50,480
It's none of your business.

237
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:53,640
Look.

238
00:13:54,170 --> 00:13:55,210
It must be a monster.

239
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:57,130
Little girl.

240
00:13:58,140 --> 00:14:00,420
Ji Ruochen is the vanguard.

241
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:01,710
You dare to disobey his order?

242
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:03,260
Besides,

243
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:05,440
he wants to protect you.

244
00:14:09,010 --> 00:14:11,600
Yes. Lord Vanguard.

245
00:14:12,530 --> 00:14:13,240
I'll follow your order.

246
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:15,480
Mr. Ji.

247
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:16,740
I'm just a scholar.

248
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:18,520
I can't go with you to kill the demon,

249
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:19,860
but

250
00:14:20,410 --> 00:14:22,950
I can give you a gift.

251
00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:25,400
A book?

252
00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:27,310
This is the Qianyuan Manual.

253
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:29,330
Although it's a little tattered,

254
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:30,230
I bet

255
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:32,140
it will be useful.

256
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,060
Then I'll accept it.

257
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:36,460
Thank you.

258
00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:39,610
Let's go.

259
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:44,070
Little green worm.

260
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:46,080
They are a couple. What's the point of going with them?

261
00:14:46,310 --> 00:14:46,820
Stay here.

262
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:47,750
Let me tell you a story.

263
00:14:57,150 --> 00:14:58,940
Yinyin always said it when she was angry.

264
00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:01,540
She wanted the whole world to know that she was angry.

265
00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:04,310
But this time, she didn't say anything.

266
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:06,260
It really makes me worried.

267
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:08,250
It seems I'm thousands of miles away from her.

268
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:46,500
The army in the city won't listen to the order.

269
00:15:47,130 --> 00:15:48,250
They said it was the King of Haofang's order.

270
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:51,420
Senior Qiushui and Senior Xuanzhen were very angry.

271
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:54,860
The King of Haofang insisted on waiting in the city.

272
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:57,320
The King of Haofang

273
00:15:57,450 --> 00:15:59,430
is really willing to risk his life for wealth.

274
00:16:17,490 --> 00:16:19,200
Fairy Gu said nothing happened there.

275
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:22,860
Yinyin,

276
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:24,540
do you want to take a look?

277
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:26,370
Fairy Gu also wrote down

278
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:27,120
the mantra to seal Bamboo Snake.

279
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,670
It might be useful to us.

280
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:32,940
I don't want what's not mine.

281
00:16:33,090 --> 00:16:33,510
I'll pass.

282
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:40,420
Does that mean she'll listen to her mother

283
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,270
and leave me?

284
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:44,460
As long as she doesn't leave me,

285
00:16:45,050 --> 00:16:46,010
I'll tell her everything.

286
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:58,580
When I was in Xixuan Mountains,

287
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:00,920
I was always afraid that someone would find out.

288
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,000
So I kept it a secret.

289
00:17:04,099 --> 00:17:05,339
When Sect Leader asked me to come here,

290
00:17:05,619 --> 00:17:07,800
I knew I couldn't hide it anymore.

291
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:10,780
I wanted to tell you several times.

292
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:12,849
But

293
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:14,300
I didn't have the courage.

294
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:15,460
First of all,

295
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:17,270
we don't have any deep grudges.

296
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:18,710
Second, you said

297
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,160
you don't like Fairy Gu.

298
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:21,680
Did you

299
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:24,089
have an engagement before you became a disciple of Xixuan?

300
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:25,650
Or are you married?

301
00:17:25,849 --> 00:17:27,790
What are you thinking about?

302
00:17:28,339 --> 00:17:29,580
If I were married,

303
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:30,690
I wouldn't have pursued you

304
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:31,570
to make you sad.

305
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:33,770
It is more important than this.

306
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:41,050
I'm not a banished god.

307
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:42,550
I am a fake.

308
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:50,180
I've been hiding this.

309
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:51,850
I was afraid that I wouldn't have a chance to become a disciple of Xixuan.

310
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:53,510
I was afraid that I couldn't see you again.

311
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:55,740
I'm afraid that after they know the truth,

312
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:58,240
you and I will both be laughed at by the rest of the world.

313
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:34,420
Were you afraid?

314
00:18:38,810 --> 00:18:39,380
Yes.

315
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,740
I thought you despised me for being a fake banished god.

316
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:46,030
I'm thinking

317
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:47,940
how about sending a paper crane to Gu Qing

318
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:49,460
to tell her this.

319
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:51,740
I should tell her face to face.

320
00:18:51,970 --> 00:18:53,570
I want to see her look.

321
00:18:56,390 --> 00:18:58,340
Don't you blame me for hiding it?

322
00:18:59,050 --> 00:19:00,310
Of course I blame you.

323
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:02,020
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

324
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:02,950
Otherwise, Gu Qing

325
00:19:02,990 --> 00:19:04,300
wouldn't have pestered you.

326
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,040
The hierarch wouldn't have forced you to marry her.

327
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:06,630
And

328
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:08,260
I cried so sadly that day.

329
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:08,980
But you didn't tell me.

330
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:09,460
I...

331
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:11,200
I think you really want to marry Gu Qing.

332
00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:11,940
Right?

333
00:19:12,010 --> 00:19:13,220
I'm a fake banished god.

334
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:14,820
I don't deserve Fairy Gu.

335
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:17,700
That's true.

336
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:19,620
As a mortal,

337
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:21,620
it's better for you to be with me, who is also a mortal.

338
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:25,500
But why do you have the bluestone?

339
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:27,280
And it reacts to you.

340
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:31,600
This stone belonged to Yinfeng.

341
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:33,980
But it's a long story.

342
00:19:34,370 --> 00:19:35,330
As for why

343
00:19:35,330 --> 00:19:36,820
it regards me as its master,

344
00:19:37,530 --> 00:19:38,670
I can't really explain it.

345
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:41,870
Whatever.

346
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:43,530
After the demon is eliminated,

347
00:19:43,530 --> 00:19:44,650
you can return it to Yinfeng.

348
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:46,610
Let Gu Qing and Yinfeng be a couple.

349
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:47,980
After they return to the God Realm,

350
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:49,710
I will establish memorial tablets for them

351
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:50,780
and worship them.

352
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:52,820
You.

353
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:54,520
What?

354
00:19:54,770 --> 00:19:55,260
Nothing.

355
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:56,370
However,

356
00:19:56,860 --> 00:19:59,160
if I'm despised by decent sects,

357
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:01,190
will you really not dislike me?

358
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:03,460
If anyone dares to bully you,

359
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:04,890
I'll beat him up.

360
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:45,930
If I can go back to Xixuan alive,

361
00:20:46,650 --> 00:20:48,370
I'll make it clear to Master Ziyang.

362
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:51,330
I'll go to the Taixuan Palace to propose marriage in front of your parents.

363
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:00,660
If you don't show up,

364
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:02,370
I'll teach you a lesson.

365
00:21:32,450 --> 00:21:33,220
I'm sorry.

366
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:34,500
Please forgive me.

367
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:37,780
I just didn't want you to get wet.

368
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:47,380
Since you're not here for the demon,

369
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:50,260
why did you come to Haofang?

370
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:57,660
To meet someone, and to kill someone.

371
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:00,450
To kill whom?

372
00:22:03,090 --> 00:22:04,160
When I regain my consciousness of god,

373
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:06,090
I'll know.

374
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:30,970
[Qianyuan Manual]

375
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:33,020
The Dreadstar Fate-Infusion Technique?

376
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:35,930
Why does Ji Tianxia have this kind of forbidden technique?

377
00:22:37,010 --> 00:22:38,160
Who on earth is he?

378
00:22:46,230 --> 00:22:46,680
You're awake.

379
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:51,470
Morning.

380
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:52,660
Morning.

381
00:22:53,410 --> 00:22:54,160
Did you sleep well?

382
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:03,850
The demon.

383
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:11,820
It's really in Hao River.

384
00:23:12,050 --> 00:23:12,870
I'll go down and take a look first.

385
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:15,660
Let's not alert it.

386
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:17,980
We should hide our traces with the secret technique of the Heavenly Fox.

387
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:19,130
Okay.

388
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:21,230
Let's go.

389
00:23:24,890 --> 00:23:26,090
The Imperial Advisor was right.

390
00:23:26,450 --> 00:23:27,220
Inform the Imperial Advisor now.

391
00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:27,590
Let's go.

392
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:36,420
Fairy Gu taught me the seal mantra and formation.

393
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:38,230
Let me try.

394
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:59,910
It seems that the god's seal doesn't work either.

395
00:25:42,790 --> 00:25:44,090
The demonic energy here is so strong.

396
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:45,770
But I can't even summon the Wenwang Landscape Tripod.

397
00:25:49,090 --> 00:25:50,560
I wonder if the secret technique of the Heavenly Fox works.

398
00:26:25,130 --> 00:26:26,530
Master! Madam!

399
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:27,960
Mom. Dad.

400
00:26:44,730 --> 00:26:45,290
Ruochen.

401
00:26:45,630 --> 00:26:47,350
There is spiritual power on the head of Bamboo Snake.

402
00:26:47,430 --> 00:26:48,510
The treasure must be here.

403
00:26:48,710 --> 00:26:49,490
Go get it.

404
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:50,370
Hurry!

405
00:26:50,610 --> 00:26:52,000
We won't last long.

406
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:57,470
I see it.

407
00:27:34,310 --> 00:27:34,980
Ruochen.

408
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:36,550
Judging from the way of taking the treasure,

409
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:38,830
I think he must have unfathomable power.

410
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:40,110
Bamboo Snake lost the treasure.

411
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,370
It's even more ferocious.

412
00:27:41,630 --> 00:27:43,110
Tighten the chain.

413
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:22,370
It seems that the treasure will definitely be mine.

414
00:28:29,030 --> 00:28:31,410
I didn't expect Xixuan Sect to get the treasure first.

415
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:34,550
I wanted to let you go after getting the treasure.

416
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:38,460
But now I have to kill you.

417
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:56,660
Ruochen.

418
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:37,560
Ruochen! Ruochen!

419
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:41,680
Yinyin.

420
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:42,700
-Let go of me!
-Calm down.

421
00:29:42,850 --> 00:29:43,620
Ruochen.

422
00:29:44,150 --> 00:29:45,790
Ruochen was swallowed by Bamboo Snake.

423
00:29:47,010 --> 00:29:49,090
Tell me he won't die, right?

424
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:50,260
Let's land first and discuss.

425
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:52,020
-No, I have to save Ruochen.
-Yes. Everything will be fine.

426
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:52,540
Yinyin.

427
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:53,770
-Let go of me!
-Yinyin.

428
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:55,620
I need to save Ruochen.

429
00:29:55,650 --> 00:29:56,180
Yinyin.

430
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:57,370
Ruochen!

431
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:23,030
My true spirit is disappearing.

432
00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:24,710
It's disappearing so fast.

433
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:27,620
Can't I really survive this calamity?

434
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:39,250
The Dreadstar Fate-Infusion Technique.

435
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:41,320
The most dangerous star sign

436
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:42,510
should be introduced into your own fate.

437
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:45,530
It can help people in danger significantly improve their power.

438
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:47,940
But once this technique is used,

439
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:49,560
my lifespan will be shortened.

440
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:51,070
And if anything goes wrong,

441
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:52,780
my true spirit may be destroyed,

442
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:54,240
and my soul may disappear.

443
00:30:56,140 --> 00:30:58,020
Whatever.

444
00:31:38,540 --> 00:31:40,960
Ruochen. Ruochen.

445
00:32:08,390 --> 00:32:09,750
I was so worried about you.

446
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:11,980
Are you okay?

447
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:15,740
I thought you were going to die.

448
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:17,420
Ruochen.

449
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:25,110
I'm fine.

450
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:26,620
Don't worry.

451
00:32:27,290 --> 00:32:29,110
You just hit me hard.

452
00:32:30,610 --> 00:32:32,440
I'm sorry for making you worried.

453
00:33:43,410 --> 00:33:43,990
Ruochen.

454
00:33:45,140 --> 00:33:45,680
Ruochen.

455
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:46,860
Are you okay?

456
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:47,480
I'm fine.

457
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:49,120
You're bleeding.

458
00:33:51,590 --> 00:33:52,630
This is Bamboo Snake's blood.

459
00:33:52,810 --> 00:33:53,430
It stinks.

460
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:54,340
Are you okay?

461
00:33:54,750 --> 00:33:55,160
I'm fine.

462
00:34:15,699 --> 00:34:16,730
Jingxiao Zhenren.

463
00:34:17,190 --> 00:34:19,350
I came to Haofang under the order of His Majesty

464
00:34:19,389 --> 00:34:21,630
to get the Shenzhou Energy Map.

465
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:24,219
Now that Xixuan Sect has got it,

466
00:34:24,219 --> 00:34:25,219
please return it.

467
00:34:25,290 --> 00:34:26,850
I will give it to His Majesty.

468
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:30,440
The map was taken

469
00:34:30,770 --> 00:34:31,580
when Bamboo Snake was born.

470
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:33,940
Xixuan Sect doesn't have it either.

471
00:34:34,340 --> 00:34:35,219
Jingxiao Zhenren.

472
00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:37,060
Listen to me.

473
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:39,350
As long as you give us the map,

474
00:34:39,659 --> 00:34:41,360
we'll let go of bygones.

475
00:34:41,870 --> 00:34:43,989
Please don't be stubborn.

476
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:45,620
Jingxiao Zhenren.

477
00:34:46,179 --> 00:34:49,040
The map is useless for improving your power.

478
00:34:49,090 --> 00:34:50,429
But it's closely related to

479
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:52,260
the prosperity of our dynasty.

480
00:34:52,580 --> 00:34:55,210
Protecting the people has always been Xixuan Sect's responsibility.

481
00:34:55,420 --> 00:34:56,429
If you return this map,

482
00:34:56,469 --> 00:34:58,670
it will benefit the people.

483
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:00,970
Believe it or not.

484
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:04,240
Anyway, we don't have the map.

485
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:04,880
Okay.

486
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:06,700
Fine.

487
00:35:06,830 --> 00:35:08,580
Since you are so stubborn,

488
00:35:09,090 --> 00:35:11,850
don't blame me for

489
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:13,100
upholding justice.

490
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:16,140
Look at you.

491
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:17,440
What justice?

492
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:18,730
How shameless you are!

493
00:35:19,050 --> 00:35:20,120
And you, monk.

494
00:35:20,330 --> 00:35:21,260
You slandered us!

495
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:22,050
Honey.

496
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:26,420
Xixuan Sect knows

497
00:35:26,450 --> 00:35:27,450
the use of the map.

498
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:30,010
You all know that too.

499
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:31,180
When Ruochen proposed

500
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:34,020
to seal Bamboo Snake before it was born,

501
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:36,180
you overtly agreed but covertly opposed.

502
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:37,410
You refused to help.

503
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:40,240
Now I know you wanted to

504
00:35:40,620 --> 00:35:41,860
take the treasure

505
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:43,030
after Bamboo Snake was born.

506
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:44,660
After the treasure was taken by someone else,

507
00:35:44,770 --> 00:35:47,100
you made excuses

508
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:48,300
to whitewash it.

509
00:35:48,670 --> 00:35:51,120
I thought you didn't help

510
00:35:51,250 --> 00:35:52,370
because you don't get along with Xixuan Sect.

511
00:35:52,710 --> 00:35:54,370
I didn't know it was because of this.

512
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:55,740
The treasure is not here.

513
00:35:56,130 --> 00:35:57,760
Even if it's here,

514
00:35:58,290 --> 00:36:00,570
you losers don't deserve

515
00:36:00,910 --> 00:36:03,120
the treasure that concerns the fate of the world.

516
00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:06,940
Ji Ruochen.

517
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:09,190
You are a fake banished god.

518
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:11,330
You are the biggest hypocrite.

519
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:14,780
A fake banished god?

520
00:36:20,020 --> 00:36:20,580
You don't believe it?

521
00:36:22,050 --> 00:36:23,470
Ruochen has the bluestone.

522
00:36:23,740 --> 00:36:24,520
How could he be fake?

523
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:26,470
Sun Guo.

524
00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:28,580
Ruochen has a token as evidence.

525
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:29,470
His identity

526
00:36:29,550 --> 00:36:31,270
was confirmed by the leaders of Xixuan Sect.

527
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:33,120
How could you say that?

528
00:36:33,430 --> 00:36:34,270
So,

529
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:36,450
Xixuan Sect lied.

530
00:36:36,490 --> 00:36:38,010
You found a fake banished god.

531
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:39,310
It shows you have gone astray.

532
00:36:39,650 --> 00:36:42,100
Today, I will enforce justice on behalf of the Heaven.

533
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:56,220
Ruochen.

534
00:36:56,260 --> 00:36:57,700
I've sent a signal to my seniors.

535
00:36:57,730 --> 00:36:58,770
They will be here soon.

536
00:36:58,980 --> 00:36:59,710
We got this.

537
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,190
Take Yinyin to find the treasure.

538
00:37:01,610 --> 00:37:02,710
The treasure is more important. Go.

539
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:03,960
Be careful.

540
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:04,680
Go!

541
00:37:05,130 --> 00:37:05,480
Let's go.

542
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:32,270
You saw it.

543
00:37:32,690 --> 00:37:33,560
He is a fake banished god.

544
00:37:34,050 --> 00:37:35,180
He's not your divine destiny.

545
00:37:35,980 --> 00:37:36,820
You also saw it.

546
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:38,520
These people have evil intentions.

547
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:40,020
Maybe they lied.

548
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:42,410
I have to ask Ruochen.

549
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:44,460
What if he admits it himself?

550
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:47,170
I trust him.

551
00:37:57,190 --> 00:37:58,160
You trust him.

552
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:01,360
Then I'll tear off his mask and show you who he is.

553
00:38:04,490 --> 00:38:06,020
The Eight-Trigram Map shows

554
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:07,140
the treasure is in this direction.

555
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:08,740
Why is there no trace of it?

556
00:38:09,410 --> 00:38:10,110
Master said

557
00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:12,300
the treasure hunter is much more powerful than us.

558
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,480
It's good enough to follow him here.

559
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:17,700
We can just search every inch of this place if there is no other way.

560
00:38:26,210 --> 00:38:26,830
