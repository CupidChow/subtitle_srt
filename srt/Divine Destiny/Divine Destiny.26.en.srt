[Episode 26]

4
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:19,290
Xuanzhen.

5
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:22,350
Help me.

6
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,260
-I'll save you. -It hurts.

7
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:27,960
I'll save you

8
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:29,020
even at the cost of my life.

9
00:02:29,829 --> 00:02:30,350
Xuanzhen.

10
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:45,640
Zhen.

11
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:47,280
Zhen.

12
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:49,470
Yinyin, what should we do?

13
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:50,790
How could this happen?

14
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:52,890
We haven't avenged Senior Yunfeng,

15
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,890
now you've hurt Li Xuanzhen.

16
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:58,860
No one can leave here today.

17
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,000
Ji Ruochen.

18
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:06,720
When Feng arrives,

19
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:07,650
you'll all die.

20
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:09,360
So what if he comes?

21
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:11,890
He'll die with you.

22
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:23,860
We must find a way to save him.

23
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:25,300
We must save him.

24
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:25,680
Xuanzhen.

25
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:26,440
What should we do?

26
00:03:26,829 --> 00:03:28,070
Take him back to Xixuan Mountains.

27
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:28,750
Let's go.

28
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:30,010
Hurry.

29
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:33,600
Ji Ruochen disregarded others' lives

30
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:35,890
in order to destroy the spiritual cave.

31
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:38,620
How cruel he is.

32
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:43,060
Two spiritual caves

33
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,420
have been destroyed by Ji Ruochen so far.

34
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:47,420
Qing will definitely follow him

35
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:49,510
to destroy the last spiritual cave.

36
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:52,140
I'm going to tell Qing

37
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:53,170
before they set off.

38
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:55,670
-Right. -Feng.

39
00:03:57,620 --> 00:03:57,990
No.

40
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:01,020
Banished God, all the best for your trip.

41
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:09,740
Did Feng find out

42
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:12,600
that we killed these villagers?

43
00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:13,730
Of course

44
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:15,400
not.

45
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:17,290
We are helping him.

46
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:19,329
As for Ji Ruochen,

47
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,320
since his fellow apprentice was hurt by Her Highness,

48
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:24,570
he must be furious.

49
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:27,670
If these two sides meet each other,

50
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,390
it'll be a tremendous disaster.

51
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:34,210
Ji Ruochen will be in danger.

52
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,470
I hope so.

53
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:19,420
Master Yuxuan.

54
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:20,820
How is he?

55
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:24,740
Xuan Jade has removed all the flames around him,

56
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:26,230
but somehow,

57
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:28,810
the flames on his face remain.

58
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:30,900
Looks like we still need to

59
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,550
find a way to completely eliminate it.

60
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:35,140
Master Yuxuan.

61
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:37,010
Even if we can't fully eliminate it,

62
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:38,940
is there any way to suppress the flames

63
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:40,330
and keep him from suffering?

64
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:41,310
Right.

65
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:42,720
As long as there is a way,

66
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:44,820
we'll do it

67
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:46,100
at all costs.

68
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:51,800
Your Ice Cave is made of thousand-year-old cold jade.

69
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:53,490
It may be helpful.

70
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:55,790
Okay, I'll take him to the Ice Cave now.

71
00:05:55,810 --> 00:05:56,880
I'm not going.

72
00:05:58,980 --> 00:05:59,420
Xuanzhen.

73
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:06,580
Look at the situation I am in right now.

74
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:08,660
What's the difference of moving to a new place?

75
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:10,530
There must be a way to save you.

76
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:11,860
You have to go to the Ice Cave with me.

77
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:12,800
It's useless.

78
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:15,020
Xuanzhen, listen to me.

79
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:16,220
It will work.

80
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:17,600
There's no way.

81
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:18,360
Xuanzhen.

82
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:20,520
-Come on, Xuanzhen. Listen to me. -There's no way.

83
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:21,380
Mirror!

84
00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:22,500
Mirror!

85
00:06:55,890 --> 00:06:58,570
How did I become like this?

86
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,830
Look at what I've turned into.

87
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:02,460
Why don't you kill me?

88
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:04,380
-Why don't you kill me? -Xuanzhen.

89
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:05,660
Xuanzhen, calm down.

90
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:06,930
-Why won't you kill me? -Xuanzhen.

91
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:07,980
Xuanzhen, calm down.

92
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:08,980
Why don't you kill me?

93
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:10,050
Why?

94
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:11,070
Xuanzhen.

95
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:14,260
Xuanzhen.

96
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:17,350
Go away.

97
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:17,910
Xuanzhen.

98
00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:20,110
Xuanzhen, come with me to the Ice Cave.

99
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:21,380
Forget it. I'm not going.

100
00:07:21,630 --> 00:07:22,870
I asked for it.

101
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:24,730
You don't have to do this.

102
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:26,110
I know you're suffering.

103
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:27,120
I swear

104
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:28,990
I will cure you no matter how long it takes.

105
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:30,750
I don't need you to swear.

106
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:32,080
Go away. Go.

107
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:32,490
Xuanzhen.

108
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:33,460
Go.

109
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:34,490
Calm down, Xuanzhen.

110
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:35,860
Xuanzhen, calm down.

111
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:36,510
Get lost!

112
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:38,500
-Calm down. -You too. Get lost.

113
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:40,610
Xuanzhen.

114
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:41,080
Get lost!

115
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:41,590
Xuanzhen.

116
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:42,530
Get lost!

117
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:43,190
Xuanzhen.

118
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:44,050
Get lost!

119
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:44,950
Xuanzhen.

120
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:46,150
Xuanzhen.

121
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:46,780
Get lost!

122
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:48,620
Alright, Xuanzhen. Li Xuanzhen.

123
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:49,370
Xuanzhen.

124
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,240
It's okay.

125
00:07:50,450 --> 00:07:51,640
It's okay.

126
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:53,700
You're not a monster.

127
00:07:53,970 --> 00:07:54,790
You are Li Xuanzhen.

128
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:59,300
You're the diligent and thrifty

129
00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:01,950
Li Xuanzhen who is well-behaved, good at cooking

130
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:03,960
It's okay.

131
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:06,530
You are my friend.

132
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:08,190
You are our friend

133
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:10,970
You are

134
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:12,620
my best friend.

135
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,250
You are also

136
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:15,900
my best friend.

137
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:16,510
Right.

138
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:34,870
It's okay. Xuanzhen.

139
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:37,940
It's okay. Xuanzhen.

140
00:08:37,970 --> 00:08:38,770
Don't be sad.

141
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:45,170
You're also my best...

142
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:53,650
Yuxuan.

143
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:55,890
How is Xuanzhen?

144
00:08:57,610 --> 00:08:59,520
The divine flames can't be extinguished completely.

145
00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:01,940
I'm still working on it.

146
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:05,890
Senior, do we really have to

147
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:07,490
destroy the last spiritual cave?

148
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:08,380
I disagree.

149
00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:10,730
Yunfeng has gone.

150
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:13,860
Fortress has lost Xuanzhen.

151
00:09:15,770 --> 00:09:18,800
Now all the major sects are angry.

152
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:20,540
They'll definitely try their best to stop him.

153
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:24,110
Are we going to sit by

154
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:25,490
and watch Ruochen court death?

155
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:27,420
Right.

156
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:29,370
Although Xixuan Sect is the number one sect,

157
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:31,230
we don't want to be an enemy against the world.

158
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:33,380
We've already destroyed two spiritual caves.

159
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:35,330
Let's forget about the last one.

160
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:36,660
Do you think

161
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:38,200
the other sects will appreciate us

162
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:40,690
if we keep the last one untouched?

163
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:44,400
Since we've started it, we must do it to the end.

164
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,600
That's also what Hierarch wants.

165
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:48,840
If Hierarch insists,

166
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:50,940
let us old guys

167
00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:51,930
to go with Ruochen.

168
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:52,560
Otherwise,

169
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:54,490
I

170
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:55,860
will never agree.

171
00:09:56,590 --> 00:09:59,190
Sun Guo is gathering all sects across the world

172
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:00,090
to attack Xixuan.

173
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:01,520
If we all go,

174
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:04,360
who will protect Xixuan?

175
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:07,720
Are we going to watch Ruochen court death?

176
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:11,220
Ruochen has the ability

177
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:14,040
to destroy two spiritual caves in a row

178
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:15,230
with the help of the Demon Emperor of Netherworld and the men of the two banished gods.

179
00:10:15,930 --> 00:10:18,010
Isn't that enough to prove his ability?

180
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:19,160
Ziyun.

181
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:21,690
You need to have faith in Ruochen.

182
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:23,450
Senior.

183
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:27,840
What if Ruochen ends up like Xuanzhen?

184
00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:31,530
Then his whole life will be ruined.

185
00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:35,500
Ruochen.

186
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:38,630
You came at the right time.

187
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:39,790
Come here.

188
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,880
Greetings, Master.

189
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:46,310
Masters, Master Yuxuan.

190
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:48,900
Ruochen, think carefully. You...

191
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:49,430
Master.

192
00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:51,680
I heard it outside.

193
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:53,040
Please

194
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:54,470
rest assured.

195
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:56,460
When I was in the Sand Sea,

196
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:57,880
I got the divine weapon, Demon Spear,

197
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:00,480
and tamed Chaotic Thunder Dragon as my main weapon.

198
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:02,590
They can't stop me.

199
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:03,340
Okay.

200
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:05,060
Great.

201
00:11:07,530 --> 00:11:09,170
Juniors.

202
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:12,180
I believe even if the two banished gods cooperate,

203
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:14,460
they are no match for Ruochen.

204
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:15,980
Let us old guys

205
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:17,940
guard Xixuan in peace

206
00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:20,570
and wait for Ruochen to return victorious.

207
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:24,100
Ruochen, when will you go down the mountains?

208
00:11:25,410 --> 00:11:28,010
Master, I plan to go down the mountains in two days.

209
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:28,960
Okay.

210
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:30,440
You've destroyed two caves in a row.

211
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:31,900
You do need some rest.

212
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:33,140
If you need someone to help you,

213
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,950
you can choose anyone from our sect.

214
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:37,450
Master, I can do it alone.

215
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:48,020
Ruochen.

216
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:50,970
I'll entrust you

217
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:53,510
with Xixuan.

218
00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:59,000
Master, don't worry.

219
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:16,630
Xuanzhen.

220
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:18,670
I know you don't want to see me,

221
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,200
but you can't delay healing the wound any longer.

222
00:12:22,430 --> 00:12:23,740
If you really hate me,

223
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:25,280
I'll leave the Ice Cave.

224
00:12:25,950 --> 00:12:27,170
Then you won't get annoyed.

225
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:28,810
I've told you.

226
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:30,200
I will never go.

227
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:31,540
Bingxian.

228
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:33,280
This has nothing to do with you.

229
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:34,310
I've told you.

230
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:35,950
You don't have to think of me for everything.

231
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:46,020
Although this medicine

232
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:47,410
isn't that helpful for putting out the divine flames,

233
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:49,180
Master Yuxuan said

234
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:50,700
it can relieve your pain.

235
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:54,700
Xixuan, drink it.

236
00:12:57,260 --> 00:12:57,670
Come on.

237
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:00,330
I don't want it.

238
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:01,730
What's wrong?

239
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,400
Are you going to take care of me for the rest of my life?

240
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:08,110
I said

241
00:13:08,690 --> 00:13:10,020
I'll try my best to find a way to cure you

242
00:13:10,210 --> 00:13:11,500
no matter how long it takes.

243
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:26,530
Senior.

244
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:35,710
Hierarch ordered you to move to the Ice Cave

245
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,000
for better healing your wound.

246
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:40,470
Xuanzhen.

247
00:13:40,890 --> 00:13:42,450
You don't have to listen to Bingxian

248
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:44,420
or me.

249
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:47,310
[Ziyang]

250
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:45,700
But are you sure

251
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,070
you want to disobey this order?

252
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:01,380
I don't believe it.

253
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:03,340
Why would Hierarch

254
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:04,990
bother with such a small thing?

255
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:08,470
Since you don't believe the order,

256
00:14:08,770 --> 00:14:10,230
I'll ask him to come in person.

257
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:14,490
My wound won't heal.

258
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:17,050
It doesn't matter where I live.

259
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:19,180
If you don't go,

260
00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:21,050
I'll ground myself in the Tianxin Cave as punishment

261
00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:22,220
until you go.

262
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:29,930
It's wet and cold

263
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:31,350
in the Tianxin Cave.

264
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:33,290
How can you stay there?

265
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:35,150
So you knew she can't stay there.

266
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:36,870
But you've been rejecting Bingxing.

267
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:38,180
Do you think she will feel at ease?

268
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:46,320
Okay, I'll go.

269
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:50,030
You two, pack up.

270
00:14:50,050 --> 00:14:50,760
Yes, Senior.

271
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,170
Senior, you did a good job.

272
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:00,840
Thank you, Yinyin.

273
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,720
Xuanzhen has finally moved to the Ice Cave to heal his wound.

274
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:08,890
I hope he can recover soon.

275
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:11,300
Ruochen.

276
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:12,570
You must take us with you

277
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:13,910
to destroy the spiritual cave.

278
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,130
Xuanzhen

279
00:15:15,210 --> 00:15:16,220
must think so too.

280
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:17,860
Qiushui.

281
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:19,680
Don't persuade me on this anymore.

282
00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:22,130
The reason I don't want to bring you

283
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:23,020
is

284
00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:24,450
something big will happen in Xixuan.

285
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:25,710
You must stay.

286
00:15:27,090 --> 00:15:27,480
But...

287
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:29,060
Will there be anything more important

288
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:30,380
than destroying the spiritual cave?

289
00:15:32,330 --> 00:15:33,440
Master got the news

290
00:15:33,690 --> 00:15:35,610
that Sun Guo is persuading the other sects

291
00:15:35,650 --> 00:15:37,000
to attack Xixuan Sect.

292
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:38,500
The Demon Emperor of Netherworld

293
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:39,920
is mad at us

294
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:41,820
because the spiritual cave at the Sand Sea was destroyed.

295
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:44,070
If they cooperate

296
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:45,690
to fight Xixuan Sect,

297
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:47,850
I'm afraid this will be a fierce battle.

298
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:49,470
It won't be easier than destroying the spiritual cave.

299
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:51,230
Besides, I’m confident

300
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:52,400
I can destroy

301
00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:53,310
the last spiritual cave on my own,

302
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:55,460
so everyone must stay

303
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:56,410
to protect Xixuan Sect.

304
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:57,700
Everyone?

305
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,330
Including Yinyin?

306
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:02,440
She is

307
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:04,080
like a plaster now.

308
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:05,700
You can't get rid of her.

309
00:16:08,650 --> 00:16:09,360
I think

310
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:11,750
Yinyin seems to

311
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:12,820
have feelings for you again.

312
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:14,390
If she falls in love with you

313
00:16:14,630 --> 00:16:15,600
and forget you again,

314
00:16:16,130 --> 00:16:17,620
isn't it like a poison

315
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:21,060
to both of you?

316
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:26,280
Right.

317
00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:29,480
So I have to think of another way.

318
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,470
What do you need to think about?

319
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:39,970
They are blaming me

320
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:41,880
for not taking them with me

321
00:16:41,990 --> 00:16:43,280
to destroy the spiritual cave.

322
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:45,960
You don't have to take them,

323
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:46,870
but don't try to dump me.

324
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:47,620
Don't forget.

325
00:16:47,710 --> 00:16:48,390
I know

326
00:16:48,410 --> 00:16:49,340
where the last spiritual cave is.

327
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:50,280
Don’t play tricks.

328
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:55,760
It's okay if you can't go.

329
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:57,260
I'll give you

330
00:16:57,290 --> 00:16:58,340
half of my credit.

331
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:02,080
You are so generous, Yinyin.

332
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:03,820
After all, I've been your senior for so many years.

333
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:04,619
Okay.

334
00:17:05,890 --> 00:17:06,510
Senior Ji.

335
00:17:06,849 --> 00:17:07,980
Has Xuanzhen been settled?

336
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:09,480
Yes.

337
00:17:09,859 --> 00:17:11,540
Take Shi Ji and me to have a look.

338
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:12,089
Okay.

339
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:12,710
Okay.

340
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:15,020
Let's go.

341
00:17:25,910 --> 00:17:27,069
When Xuanzhen recovers,

342
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,610
this place is also suitable for him to rest.

343
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:33,620
Yes.

344
00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:35,630
Once I finish my mission,

345
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:36,900
I'll bring Xuanzhen here

346
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:38,010
to live with me.

347
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:40,850
Qiushui and Bingxian

348
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:42,300
will take care of him.

349
00:17:42,610 --> 00:17:43,420
I'll be relieved then.

350
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:46,070
When are we leaving?

351
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:48,840
Once everything's done,

352
00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:49,800
we'll set out immediately.

353
00:17:50,210 --> 00:17:50,810
You'd better hurry up.

354
00:17:50,990 --> 00:17:52,380
I also have something to do.

355
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:08,950
We've been searching for the Kunlun Golden Sand

356
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,930
for years,

357
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:12,390
but we didn't see any.

358
00:18:12,770 --> 00:18:14,020
I didn't expect there's so much

359
00:18:14,450 --> 00:18:15,690
in Xixuan Mountains.

360
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:17,380
I heard that you two

361
00:18:17,650 --> 00:18:19,600
are very knowledgeable in making weapons.

362
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:21,120
I asked my disciples

363
00:18:21,170 --> 00:18:22,310
to bring these things here.

364
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:24,220
I don't know if these

365
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:25,380
can be helpful to you.

366
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,960
Of course they're helpful.

367
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:28,270
That's good.

368
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:29,400
You two can

369
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:31,710
go to the weapon warehouse of Xixuan Sect sometime.

370
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:33,140
Tell my disciples

371
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:34,970
if you need anything.

372
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:36,540
Thank you, Master Ziyang.

373
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:37,710
Please rest assured.

374
00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:39,050
With these good things,

375
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:40,820
we will

376
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,180
create more

377
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:45,620
invincible and powerful

378
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:47,090
Dragon and Tiger Universal Cannons for Xixuan.

379
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:49,410
Thank you.

380
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:50,870
You're welcome.

381
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:51,350
Master.

382
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:52,820
Sun Guo set a sinister formation

383
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,430
for the battle at the Fortress.

384
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:56,140
We were almost trapped inside.

385
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:57,490
It took a lot of effort for Mr. Ji and Yinyin

386
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:58,950
to destroy the spiritual cave.

387
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:00,500
I'm afraid it'll be more difficult

388
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:02,000
to destroy the last one.

389
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:05,210
Are you sure you want Mr. Ji to continue to destroy the spiritual cave?

390
00:19:06,050 --> 00:19:07,330
This is Ruochen's destiny.

391
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:09,080
He was born

392
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:10,540
to take this responsibility.

393
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:13,040
Life is so unfair.

394
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:15,370
He fought the banished god after fighting the Bamboo Snake.

395
00:19:15,450 --> 00:19:17,610
Now he's fighting against all the cultivators.

396
00:19:17,850 --> 00:19:19,090
It's a narrow escape.

397
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:20,360
Qing.

398
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:23,860
Since ancient times, people who carry great responsibilities are always like this.

399
00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:25,330
I have things to do.

400
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:26,580
I have to go.

401
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:34,460
Are you saying Mr. Ji will be fine?

402
00:19:35,570 --> 00:19:36,410
But it's okay.

403
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:37,930
Even if life is unfair,

404
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:39,140
he still has our help.

405
00:19:39,330 --> 00:19:40,220
Am I right, Ling?

406
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:41,750
Qingyi.

407
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:43,500
Didn’t Master say

408
00:19:43,910 --> 00:19:46,010
we Endless Sea can't interfere in destroying the spiritual cave?

409
00:19:46,410 --> 00:19:47,210
Why did you forget again?

410
00:19:47,630 --> 00:19:48,430
With you around,

411
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,640
I don't have a chance to interfere even if I want to.

412
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:53,020
I've received Master's order.

413
00:19:53,370 --> 00:19:54,740
He wants me to get back to the Endless Sea as soon as possible.

414
00:19:56,910 --> 00:19:58,210
You're going back?

415
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:00,630
So,

416
00:20:01,130 --> 00:20:02,900
you must remember what you promised Master.

417
00:20:03,430 --> 00:20:05,200
Don’t interfere in destroying the spiritual cave,

418
00:20:07,150 --> 00:20:08,960
but you can protect Mr. Ji and Yinyin.

419
00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:11,820
I know.

420
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:12,930
Let me walk you out.

421
00:20:13,490 --> 00:20:14,280
Well, then...

422
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:15,570
As for these two fools,

423
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:16,880
even if they've got the Kunlun Golden Sand,

424
00:20:16,910 --> 00:20:17,950
they won't be able to take it away.

425
00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:19,260
Just let them work on it.

426
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:20,970
Be careful.

427
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:29,380
Ling, are you really leaving?

428
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:32,980
It’s Master’s order.

429
00:20:34,030 --> 00:20:35,830
Your master even asked you to protect Qingyi.

430
00:20:36,370 --> 00:20:37,290
That mask guy is weird.

431
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:39,080
How could he not keep his words?

432
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:41,500
How about

433
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:43,390
you pretend you didn’t receive your master’s order

434
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,130
and continue to destroy the spiritual cave with us?

435
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:46,960
Then you can protect me and Qingyi.

436
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:49,050
Ji Ruochen will protect you.

437
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:50,450
What are you talking about?

438
00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:52,470
He pushed me to you when you came last time.

439
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:54,990
It won't happen again.

440
00:20:56,290 --> 00:20:56,930
Trust me.

441
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,000
Take care, Yinyin.

442
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:09,350
Why didn't he get it?

443
00:21:09,710 --> 00:21:10,930
Who needs your protection?

444
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:12,620
I just want you to stay

445
00:21:12,650 --> 00:21:13,690
and hang out with us.

446
00:21:18,170 --> 00:21:18,890
I'm gonna go find Master.

447
00:21:20,450 --> 00:21:21,560
Junior Ji

448
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:22,530
is indeed amazing,

449
00:21:22,550 --> 00:21:23,430
but I'm also good.

450
00:21:23,830 --> 00:21:25,530
My fox tail

451
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:27,470
even made Yinfeng dizzy.

452
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:28,460
Anyway,

453
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,190
my junior and I cooperated well.

454
00:21:30,610 --> 00:21:32,450
We destroyed the spiritual cave in front of them.

455
00:21:32,610 --> 00:21:33,250
Am I good?

456
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:36,870
What’s your junior’s name?

457
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:38,500
The one who destroyed the spiritual cave.

458
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:40,060
His name is...

459
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:42,290
His name is Ji…

460
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:46,350
I usually call him Junior.

461
00:21:46,650 --> 00:21:48,090
I forgot his name.

462
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:51,110
Forget it.

463
00:21:51,450 --> 00:21:52,750
I don't really want to know.

464
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:56,100
You've been talking for a while,

465
00:21:56,420 --> 00:21:57,370
your junior

466
00:21:57,620 --> 00:21:58,850
seems to treat you well, right?

467
00:22:03,610 --> 00:22:04,410
Well...

468
00:22:05,270 --> 00:22:06,050
It's hard to say.

469
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,080
Why not?

470
00:22:10,890 --> 00:22:12,600
Xuanzhen and Qiushui said

471
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:13,630
he likes me,

472
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:14,930
so I asked him in person.

473
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:15,940
He denied it.

474
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:18,200
If he doesn't like me,

475
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:19,790
he is really nice to me

476
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:21,280
and takes care of me.

477
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:23,350
But if he likes me,

478
00:22:23,730 --> 00:22:24,890
he always pulls a long face on me

479
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:25,950
and pushes me away.

480
00:22:27,110 --> 00:22:28,850
Master, you are knowledgeable.

481
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:30,140
What do you think

482
00:22:30,170 --> 00:22:31,690
is wrong with him?

483
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:34,830
I think

484
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:37,240
he's just forgetful.

485
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:38,820
Forgetful?

486
00:22:40,390 --> 00:22:41,070
Master.

487
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:42,860
Do you think I was born yesterday?

488
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:44,730
What about you?

489
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:46,680
You didn't leave even if he pushed you away.

490
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:48,300
Have you fallen in love with him?

491
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:49,120
I...

492
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:51,650
I didn't leave because I wanted to destroy the spiritual cave.

493
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:52,590
I wanted to help.

494
00:22:53,030 --> 00:22:53,830
Besides,

495
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:55,390
I just met him at the spiritual cave in the Sand Sea.

496
00:22:55,410 --> 00:22:56,860
How could I have fallen in love with him?

497
00:22:57,740 --> 00:22:58,400
Are you sure?

498
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:01,840
I'm sure.

499
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:04,870
You don't believe me?

500
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:08,950
Whether I believe you or not,

501
00:23:09,570 --> 00:23:10,770
the result is still the same.

502
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:15,580
But it's not a bad thing.

503
00:23:16,330 --> 00:23:17,210
Master.

504
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:19,020
What are you talking about?

505
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,000
Why didn't I get it?

506
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:23,820
You'll get it sooner or later.

507
00:23:24,910 --> 00:23:25,390
Go back.

508
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:27,340
Okay.

509
00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:36,930
Yinyin.

510
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:38,500
Be careful when you're out there.

511
00:23:38,890 --> 00:23:39,970
Don't push yourself too hard.

512
00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:41,150
Don't worry, Madam.

513
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,560
I will take good care of her.

514
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:45,820
Ruochen, Yinyin.

515
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:47,560
We'll wait for you two to come back.

516
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:48,570
Alright.

517
00:23:48,730 --> 00:23:50,060
We're just going to destroy a spiritual cave.

518
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,620
Why is the vibe so heavy?

519
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,040
We'll be back soon.

520
00:23:53,570 --> 00:23:54,270
Right, Junior?

521
00:23:55,270 --> 00:23:55,690
We're gonna go.

522
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:57,180
Yinyin.

523
00:23:57,590 --> 00:23:58,150
Qingyi.

524
00:23:58,510 --> 00:23:59,380
Dragon Elephant, White Tiger.

525
00:23:59,550 --> 00:24:00,310
Are you coming along?

526
00:24:00,790 --> 00:24:02,470
Uncle asked me to help you.

527
00:24:02,690 --> 00:24:04,210
Master Ziyang also agreed.

528
00:24:04,230 --> 00:24:05,400
You can't get rid of me.

529
00:24:05,430 --> 00:24:06,280
Okay.

530
00:24:06,310 --> 00:24:06,670
Let's go.

531
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:14,140
Qiushui.

532
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:18,040
Please take care of Xuanzhen.

533
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:19,800
Don't worry.

534
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:43,010
Someone from the Xuanming Palace got injured.

535
00:24:43,250 --> 00:24:44,500
Why should Bingxian

536
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:45,590
give up the Ice Cave?

537
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:47,210
What can she do?

538
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:49,300
He got injured for destroying the spiritual cave.

539
00:24:50,250 --> 00:24:51,820
Didn't he know his capability?

540
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:53,610
He's only been on the Qingyun List several times.

541
00:24:54,350 --> 00:24:55,380
He overestimated himself too much.

542
00:24:55,490 --> 00:24:56,250
Even he wanted to fight for credit?

543
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:57,050
He's our fellow apprentice.

544
00:24:57,060 --> 00:24:58,720
If I hear you saying these again, I'll cut your tongue off.

545
00:24:59,290 --> 00:25:00,090
Senior.

546
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:03,310
Xuanzhen.

547
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:04,560
Xuanzhen.

548
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:11,150
I'm sorry

549
00:25:12,130 --> 00:25:13,300
for causing you trouble.

550
00:25:13,350 --> 00:25:14,350
What are you talking about, Xuanzhen?

551
00:25:14,670 --> 00:25:15,510
We're brothers.

552
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:16,790
Don't mention it.

553
00:25:17,610 --> 00:25:18,370
Let me see.

554
00:25:27,130 --> 00:25:28,170
Luckily, it's not burning again.

555
00:25:28,790 --> 00:25:29,740
Get some fresh air.

556
00:25:29,770 --> 00:25:30,980
It may be helpful for the recovery.

557
00:25:32,530 --> 00:25:33,020
Xuanzhen.

558
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:34,600
Don't take what they said into heart.

559
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:36,440
Not everyone has the same relationship

560
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:38,980
like what you have among you, Qiushui and Ruochen.

561
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:40,210
Exactly.

562
00:25:40,450 --> 00:25:41,240
Don't care too much

563
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:42,430
what they said.

564
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:43,530
Let's go.

565
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:45,170
I learned a new way to cook medicine yesterday.

566
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:45,950
I'll cook it for you.

567
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:49,330
They were right.

568
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:53,100
I'm no different from a loser now.

569
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:55,550
But now,

570
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:58,390
I can't hold Ruochen back anymore.

571
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:01,560
I hope he can come back safely soon.

572
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:02,860
Don't worry.

573
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:05,830
He's managed to get out of danger

574
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:06,890
after going through so many hardships.

575
00:26:07,270 --> 00:26:08,840
This time, he will definitely come back safely.

576
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:10,380
He's also got Yinyin with him.

577
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:11,350
Don’t worry.

578
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:12,440
Let's go.

579
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:14,040
Delicious food is calling you.

580
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:14,750
Let's go.

581
00:26:15,130 --> 00:26:15,870
Let's go.

582
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:18,850
Let's go, Senior.

583
00:26:26,290 --> 00:26:28,020
Ji Ruochen is really bold.

584
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:29,820
He's really coming.

585
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:32,320
We can't let him get in the Qingyuan Holy Land.

586
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:34,990
We can't let him find the spiritual cave.

587
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:39,660
We'd rather capture him

588
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:41,760
at the spiritual cave

589
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:43,090
than let him go.

590
00:27:09,670 --> 00:27:10,470
Check this out.

591
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:13,090
The scenery here is completely different from Xixuan Mountains.

592
00:27:14,130 --> 00:27:14,690
Qingyi.

593
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:16,900
It’s a very dangerous trip to the Qingyuan Holy Land this time.

594
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:18,570
I will find a way

595
00:27:18,590 --> 00:27:19,870
to make Yinyin forget me again

596
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:21,480
and forget about destroying the spiritual cave.

597
00:27:22,290 --> 00:27:23,560
Please send Yinyin back

598
00:27:24,050 --> 00:27:25,330
to Xixuan Mountains then.

599
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:29,070
Qingyi.

600
00:27:31,490 --> 00:27:32,130
What’s wrong?

601
00:27:34,810 --> 00:27:35,570
Nothing.

602
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:37,990
Did Ji scold you again?

603
00:27:38,670 --> 00:27:39,430
No.

604
00:27:40,050 --> 00:27:41,620
Yinyin, stop asking.

605
00:27:42,570 --> 00:27:44,060
He is always like this.

606
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,090
He's serious when he cares about others.

607
00:27:46,630 --> 00:27:47,090
Don't worry.

608
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:48,320
I'll teach him a lesson for you.

609
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:53,350
What should I do?

610
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:55,360
I don't want to be this bad guy.

611
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:58,410
I’ll feel guilty when I see her.

612
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:08,910
You’re quick.

613
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,240
You came out to get water so quickly.

614
00:28:11,910 --> 00:28:13,070
You should stay inside and keep warm.

615
00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:14,060
Why did you come out?

616
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:15,300
Of course I'm here to see you.

617
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:16,920
Did you scold Qingyi?

618
00:28:17,090 --> 00:28:18,690
She was so upset when she came to me.

619
00:28:19,250 --> 00:28:21,290
She just wanted to stay and help.

620
00:28:21,350 --> 00:28:22,880
Why are you so strict with her?

621
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:25,310
Fine.

622
00:28:29,670 --> 00:28:30,380
Plum blossom.

623
00:28:45,370 --> 00:28:46,210
That girl

624
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:48,210
only cares about food

625
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:49,920
and those small tricks.

626
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:51,880
She has no idea what love is.

627
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:53,590
Last New Year's Eve,

628
00:28:53,790 --> 00:28:55,790
I picked some plum blossoms

629
00:28:55,970 --> 00:28:57,100
and gave them to her for the Spring Festival,

630
00:28:57,770 --> 00:28:58,550
but she used them

631
00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:00,260
to make dumplings for me.

632
00:29:05,230 --> 00:29:05,830
Is it pretty?

633
00:29:07,990 --> 00:29:08,510
Yes.

634
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:11,910
It's hard for them to blossom in this cold whether.

635
00:29:12,470 --> 00:29:14,590
Remember, don't make dumplings with them.

636
00:29:15,090 --> 00:29:16,490
It's good to boil them in water.

637
00:29:17,710 --> 00:29:18,440
They are my flowers.

638
00:29:18,470 --> 00:29:19,750
I can eat them in whatever way I like.

639
00:29:19,810 --> 00:29:20,500
It's none of your business.

640
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:23,070
Is the water full?

641
00:29:24,370 --> 00:29:25,050
Yes.

642
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:42,130
It's snowing.

643
00:29:58,990 --> 00:30:00,500
We are so lucky.

644
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:01,760
I haven't seen

645
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:02,930
such big snow for years.

646
00:30:04,690 --> 00:30:05,480
Let's have a snowball fight

647
00:30:05,510 --> 00:30:06,550
after dinner.

648
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:11,740
Junior.

649
00:30:12,690 --> 00:30:13,720
Are you still worried

650
00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:14,740
about destroying the spiritual cave?

651
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:16,690
No.

652
00:30:17,730 --> 00:30:19,090
What's wrong?

653
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:20,500
It's okay. Just tell me.

654
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:21,780
I am good

655
00:30:21,930 --> 00:30:22,850
at consoling people.

656
00:30:28,530 --> 00:30:29,950
Are you a blockhead?

657
00:30:30,190 --> 00:30:31,310
You always blow hot and cold.

658
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:32,930
I have to go.

659
00:30:38,630 --> 00:30:39,190
Yinyin.

660
00:30:39,730 --> 00:30:40,490
I'm sorry.

661
00:30:40,590 --> 00:30:41,700
It's snowing.

662
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:42,490
I don't want to…

663
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:45,750
Forget me completely.

664
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:47,180
Leave me

665
00:30:48,110 --> 00:30:49,060
and be happy like now

666
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:51,420
for the rest of your life.

667
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:42,970
Letting Yinyin forget him again

668
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:44,830
must be

669
00:31:45,010 --> 00:31:46,420
heartbreaking for Mr. Ji.

670
00:31:47,830 --> 00:31:48,740
In that case,

671
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:50,370
I'll ask her on his behalf.

672
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:55,760
Yinyin,

673
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:57,490
do you love Mr. Ji?

674
00:31:59,010 --> 00:32:00,080
Cut it out.

675
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:00,870
You're so young.

676
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:01,900
Do you know what love is?

677
00:32:02,510 --> 00:32:03,770
Just tell me.

678
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:04,790
Do you love him or not?

679
00:32:07,270 --> 00:32:07,860
No.

680
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,400
How could you not love him?

681
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:12,640
He's capable,

682
00:32:12,670 --> 00:32:14,010
kind and humorous.

683
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:17,460
You think so highly of him.

684
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:18,640
Do you love him?

685
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:21,000
You can't love him.

686
00:32:21,030 --> 00:32:21,980
Yinyin.

687
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:23,590
You don’t love him,

688
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:24,960
and you don't allow others to love him?

689
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:26,420
He's not your boyfriend.

690
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:29,580
I'm his senior.

691
00:32:29,970 --> 00:32:30,990
A senior is like a mother.

692
00:32:31,410 --> 00:32:32,850
I have the final say

693
00:32:32,870 --> 00:32:33,960
on who he is with.

694
00:32:35,790 --> 00:32:37,510
Time to eat.

695
00:32:40,470 --> 00:32:41,310
Anyway,

696
00:32:41,430 --> 00:32:42,710
you can't love him.

697
00:32:42,930 --> 00:32:43,490
Do you hear me?

698
00:32:43,970 --> 00:32:44,920
Yinyin.

699
00:32:45,290 --> 00:32:46,290
You can control everything

700
00:32:46,310 --> 00:32:47,190
but not this.

701
00:32:56,370 --> 00:32:57,080
Mr. Ji,

702
00:32:57,770 --> 00:33:00,320
I wanted to force Yinyin to admit her feelings for you,

703
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:02,190
but she said

704
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:04,120
she doesn't like you.

705
00:33:21,850 --> 00:33:22,890
What are you trying to hide from me?

706
00:33:23,490 --> 00:33:23,990
Tell me.

707
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:25,980
What are you plotting with Qingyi?

708
00:33:26,890 --> 00:33:28,570
I asked her to send you back to Xixuan Mountains.

709
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:30,660
Again?

710
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:33,090
Other than those bullshit

711
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:34,270
that you don't want me to get hurt,

712
00:33:34,350 --> 00:33:35,230
is there any other reason?

713
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,300
Isn't that enough?

714
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:43,970
Aren't you curious at all?

715
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:45,420
I'm your junior.

716
00:33:45,870 --> 00:33:47,230
We've always been together,

717
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:49,020
but you never remember my name.

718
00:33:49,810 --> 00:33:51,330
What's your junior's name again?

719
00:33:51,610 --> 00:33:52,820
The one who destroyed the spiritual cave.

720
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:55,100
His name is...

721
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:57,380
His name is Ji…

722
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:01,480
I usually call him Junior.

723
00:34:01,650 --> 00:34:02,760
I forgot his name.

724
00:34:04,170 --> 00:34:05,580
You're the one who's capable of destroying spiritual caves.

725
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:08,420
My master must know you,

726
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:11,590
but why did she ask me your name on purpose?

727
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:14,199
She was open with me about planting the Huanyao Root.

728
00:34:14,989 --> 00:34:16,190
Why would she hide this from me?

729
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:18,739
Because I told them not to mention me in front of you.

730
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:20,909
Because every time you thought of me,

731
00:34:21,420 --> 00:34:22,560
you would have a severe headache.

732
00:34:24,199 --> 00:34:25,320
Are you kidding me?

733
00:34:25,670 --> 00:34:27,219
I've never had such a weird problem.

734
00:34:27,330 --> 00:34:28,730
Think about it.

735
00:34:29,179 --> 00:34:30,750
When you were at the spiritual cave of the Sand Sea,

736
00:34:31,150 --> 00:34:32,360
you had a lot of headaches

737
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:34,170
because you remembered something.

738
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:36,130
Didn't you have a headache

739
00:34:36,270 --> 00:34:37,340
when you saw this bracelet

740
00:34:37,820 --> 00:34:38,980
at the spiritual cave of the Sand Sea?

741
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:40,350
Think about it.

742
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:41,900
Have you forgotten all of these?

743
00:34:44,610 --> 00:34:45,570
Think about it.

744
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:46,969
At whose wedding

745
00:34:46,989 --> 00:34:47,900
did you see this bracelet?

746
00:34:57,060 --> 00:34:57,990
Ring a bell?

747
00:34:58,430 --> 00:34:59,350
I don't want to recall.

748
00:34:59,690 --> 00:35:00,840
I don't want to recall.

749
00:35:01,090 --> 00:35:02,560
I don't want to recall.

750
00:35:05,550 --> 00:35:06,540
Think about it.

751
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:07,560
Think about it carefully.

752
00:35:09,750 --> 00:35:10,590
I don't want to recall.

753
00:35:10,910 --> 00:35:11,950
I don't want to recall.

754
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:12,760
Yinyin.

755
00:35:12,830 --> 00:35:13,780
