Hurry up and eat. We'll leave soon.

190
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:38,530
We've been tied up for so long.

191
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:40,380
Are your neck sore?

192
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:41,920
Let me help you.

193
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:43,180
Stop it.

194
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:47,900
To be honest,

195
00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:49,590
did you do it on purpose?

196
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:52,860
What did I do on purpose?

197
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:54,810
Didn't you hear them just now?

198
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,840
They want to strip my skin and bones

199
00:12:56,870 --> 00:12:57,950
and drink my blood.

200
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:00,990
Close your eyes.

201
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:02,850
Okay.

202
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:04,070
Whatever you say.

203
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:12,350
I thought after so long,

204
00:13:13,390 --> 00:13:15,070
I could finally forget you.

205
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:18,350
But I didn't expect you to come.

206
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:22,880
Close your eyes.

207
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:24,140
I am.

208
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:26,790
Ji Ruochen.

209
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,830
You are really my nemesis.

210
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:34,280
I told you to close your eyes.

211
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:36,540
Fine.

212
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:47,860
[Luoran's Treasure Land]

213
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:51,250
Let me tell you.

214
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:52,700
We can't die.

215
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:53,910
If I die,

216
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:54,980
all of you will die.

217
00:13:55,930 --> 00:13:56,530
Ji Ruochen.

218
00:13:57,780 --> 00:13:58,630
What did you say?

219
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:00,120
If you die,

220
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:01,900
we can't live either.

221
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,310
What do you mean?

222
00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:05,640
-Senior.
-It means…

223
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:06,610
Don't listen to him.

224
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:08,080
He's always bragging.

225
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,090
As a banished god,

226
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:11,780
he was still captured by us.

227
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:13,280
In my opinion,

228
00:14:13,590 --> 00:14:15,030
we should take them out and kill them

229
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:16,830
and avenge our fellows who died

230
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:17,660
in Haofang City.

231
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:18,720
Who dares?

232
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:20,110
Let me tell you.

233
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,530
On my way here,

234
00:14:21,650 --> 00:14:23,820
I've informed the Xixuan Sect.

235
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,620
Many of them must be on their way.

236
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:26,820
If they come here

237
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:27,710
and don't see me,

238
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:29,350
they would have destroyed your place.

239
00:14:29,490 --> 00:14:30,200
I don't believe it.

240
00:14:30,490 --> 00:14:31,670
Just wait and see.

241
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:32,810
By tonight at the latest.

242
00:14:33,010 --> 00:14:33,830
Let's see who is stronger.

243
00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:35,530
Senior.

244
00:14:35,970 --> 00:14:37,340
Don't listen to him.

245
00:14:37,730 --> 00:14:39,530
Even if the Xixuan Sect attacks, so what?

246
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,340
We can use their blood to sacrifice our blades

247
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:44,940
to boost our morale.

248
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:46,070
Sacrifice is fine.

249
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:48,240
But don't use mine.

250
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:49,190
Use hers.

251
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:51,700
Ji... Ji Ruochen, you...

252
00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:53,210
-Don’t move.
-Let me tell you.

253
00:14:53,470 --> 00:14:54,020
Her master

254
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:55,510
Ziwei is experiencing a deadly retreat.

255
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:57,270
He won't be able to get out soon.

256
00:14:57,620 --> 00:14:58,460
Just bully her.

257
00:14:58,730 --> 00:15:00,080
No one is supporting her now.

258
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:03,970
I heard that Ziwei

259
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:06,980
only took in one disciple in his life.

260
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:10,780
You mean her?

261
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:11,520
Yes.

262
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:12,330
It's her.

263
00:15:15,730 --> 00:15:16,200
Senior.

264
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:21,760
Put both of them in the dungeon first.

265
00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:23,040
Yes.

266
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:23,630
Don't.

267
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:25,360
Don't.

268
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:34,510
Go in.

269
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:46,090
Your protection level is quite high.

270
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:47,850
Of course.

271
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:49,820
Back in Haofang,

272
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:52,520
we were trapped by you Xixuan Sect.

273
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:55,510
We finally caught you.

274
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:58,600
I should let you enjoy it.

275
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:00,570
If I'm not mistaken,

276
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,470
on the walls are your precious stones, right?

277
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:03,210
Yes.

278
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:08,070
The dungeon is formed by the Heaven-sealing Stones

279
00:16:08,650 --> 00:16:09,700
and formed a formation.

280
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:12,280
It can absorb the spiritual power

281
00:16:13,050 --> 00:16:15,150
and lock the true spirit, too.

282
00:16:16,930 --> 00:16:18,790
You won't survive tonight anyway.

283
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:23,230
Why don't you enjoy it inside?

284
00:16:24,510 --> 00:16:25,510
If you're leaving,

285
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:26,950
untie us before you go.

286
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:50,460
You can't just untie her

287
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:51,450
but not me.

288
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:53,240
You guys are just enjoying the spectacle without considering the consequences.

289
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,250
Come back. Come...

290
00:17:20,349 --> 00:17:20,910
Senior.

291
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:22,520
Senior!

292
00:17:23,089 --> 00:17:23,550
Senior!

293
00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:25,200
Senior.

294
00:17:37,410 --> 00:17:40,600
The weather is really nice today.

295
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:44,820
It's not easy to climb such a high mountain.

296
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:46,050
Are you here for the sun?

297
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:48,370
No.

298
00:17:48,730 --> 00:17:51,050
I'm here for you.

299
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:53,140
What for?

300
00:17:54,090 --> 00:17:55,020
To be honest,

301
00:17:55,390 --> 00:17:57,010
I'm here to ask for your help.

302
00:17:57,510 --> 00:17:58,700
I have nothing to help you with.

303
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:00,520
And I don't want to ask

304
00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:01,510
about your messy things.

305
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:02,940
You go find someone else.

306
00:18:03,870 --> 00:18:04,670
Senior.

307
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:06,620
It's asked all of them.

308
00:18:06,970 --> 00:18:08,450
I've asked all others

309
00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:09,630
in Xixuan Mountains.

310
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,610
I even asked Senior Yunfeng.

311
00:18:11,870 --> 00:18:12,310
But in the end,

312
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:13,780
they all stated that

313
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:16,960
it can’t be done

314
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:17,920
without Senior Ji Bingxian.

315
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,780
Didn't Senior Yunfeng follow Master Ziyang

316
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:22,730
to Mount Huayun?

317
00:18:23,530 --> 00:18:24,010
Why?

318
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:25,340
It's a long way.

319
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,820
You've already made a round trip?

320
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:28,690
Senior.

321
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:33,740
Since Qiusui got married and left,

322
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:36,530
no one dared to challenge you anymore, right?

323
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:39,850
As the saying goes,

324
00:18:40,270 --> 00:18:41,160
it's cold in high places.

325
00:18:41,690 --> 00:18:43,490
On a full moon night, the dew is heavy in the late night,

326
00:18:43,910 --> 00:18:45,950
when you were

327
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:47,340
sleeping alone,

328
00:18:47,570 --> 00:18:50,140
would you feel a little lonely?

329
00:18:51,770 --> 00:18:52,900
You can't beat me anyway.

330
00:18:53,230 --> 00:18:55,120
It doesn't make much difference whether you challenge me or not.

331
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:57,910
I'm not lonely.

332
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:00,550
It's true that it's a little boring.

333
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:03,880
As long as you don't mind,

334
00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:05,310
I'll challenge you

335
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:06,510
on the day of Frost's Descent every year.

336
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:08,500
You...

337
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:09,940
Challenge me?

338
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:12,220
Li Xuanzhen.

339
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:13,930
It seems that

340
00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:15,050
I hit you lightly on that annual exam.

341
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:17,460
As long as you help me,

342
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:18,630
even if you kill me,

343
00:19:18,770 --> 00:19:19,640
I won't hesitate.

344
00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:22,870
Today,

345
00:19:23,310 --> 00:19:25,070
you are not like the Li Xuanzhen I used to know.

346
00:19:25,570 --> 00:19:26,980
Did you agree?

347
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:30,120
Tell me. What is it?

348
00:19:30,610 --> 00:19:33,010
Yinyin and Ruochen were taken away by the people of Luoran School.

349
00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:34,610
We don't know if they're dead or alive.

350
00:19:34,630 --> 00:19:35,350
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

351
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:36,230
Let's go.

352
00:19:36,370 --> 00:19:36,970
Lead the way.

353
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:46,770
Yinyin.

354
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:51,510
Yinyin.

355
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:58,270
When you were taken away by Qingyi that day,

356
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:01,060
I was going to chase after you.

357
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,730
But Master Ziyang stopped me.

358
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:05,940
So I was too late.

359
00:20:07,550 --> 00:20:08,680
Of course, I didn't fulfill

360
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:09,690
my engagement with Gu Qing.

361
00:20:11,430 --> 00:20:13,670
I searched all over Xixuan Mountains later

362
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:14,580
but I couldn't find you.

363
00:20:15,290 --> 00:20:18,020
In the end, Su He told me

364
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,010
you went down the mountain.

365
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:22,220
So I came all the way here

366
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:23,500
to look for you.

367
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:26,420
Nonsense!

368
00:20:27,650 --> 00:20:28,960
I've heard about it at the foot of the mountain.

369
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:32,190
Yun Zhong Ju and Xixuan Mountains will unite in marriage.

370
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,370
What a perfect couple.

371
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:36,860
I wasn't talking nonsense.

372
00:20:39,390 --> 00:20:40,930
If you don't believe me,

373
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,410
I have something on my chest.

374
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:45,680
You can take it out.

375
00:20:46,290 --> 00:20:46,910
Take a look.

376
00:20:49,230 --> 00:20:50,240
At this point,

377
00:20:50,930 --> 00:20:51,930
I don't want to see anything.

378
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:55,130
Just look at it.

379
00:20:55,850 --> 00:20:57,200
This is a paper crane from Mistress.

380
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:04,670
It's true.

381
00:21:12,670 --> 00:21:13,760
Gardenia's fragrance.

382
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:14,980
It belongs to my mother.

383
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:16,780
Mistress didn't know where you are,

384
00:21:17,070 --> 00:21:18,600
so she gave me this paper crane.

385
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:27,520
Yinyin.

386
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:28,820
Seeing the words as if seeing my face.

387
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:30,660
Since we parted in Haofang,

388
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:32,530
we haven't met again.

389
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:35,280
You don't know anything happened during this period.

390
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:38,870
Your father was poisoned by Xuxuan with secret poison.

391
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:39,940
His life was at stake.

392
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:42,400
I had been worried day and night.

393
00:21:43,090 --> 00:21:45,940
In order to save your father, I used your father's life

394
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:48,990
to threaten Ruochen to get married with Gu Qing

395
00:21:49,310 --> 00:21:51,540
in exchange for the antidote of Yun Zhong Ju.

396
00:21:52,170 --> 00:21:53,940
I almost created an ill-fated relationship.

397
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:56,570
Now the secret poison has been removed.

398
00:21:56,820 --> 00:21:58,260
Ji and Gu's engagement is also broken.

399
00:21:58,530 --> 00:21:59,610
Don't worry.

400
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:03,180
I hope you and Ruochen can reconcile as before

401
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:04,700
and help each other

402
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:07,210
and return to Xixuan as soon as possible.

403
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:08,110
What?

404
00:22:09,730 --> 00:22:11,340
How did so many things happen?

405
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:14,550
My father was almost killed.

406
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:16,250
Ruochen.

407
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:19,260
Why didn't you tell me?

408
00:22:20,530 --> 00:22:21,900
If I told you,

409
00:22:23,650 --> 00:22:24,700
how could I save your father?

410
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,040
If you really knew,

411
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:30,830
you would be more upset.

412
00:22:33,730 --> 00:22:34,970
Anyway,

413
00:22:35,550 --> 00:22:36,740
the misunderstanding has been cleared anyway.

414
00:22:37,650 --> 00:22:38,610
Are you still mad at me?

415
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:48,330
I'm sorry, Ruochen.

416
00:22:49,050 --> 00:22:50,690
I misunderstood you.

417
00:22:53,190 --> 00:22:54,310
I'm sorry.

418
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:56,490
Luckily,

419
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:58,260
the misunderstanding has been cleared.

420
00:22:59,090 --> 00:23:00,470
If you feel wronged,

421
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:01,790
just cry.

422
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:04,460
Although I can't hug you

423
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:05,940
with my hands tied up,

424
00:23:06,770 --> 00:23:08,950
I can lend you my shoulder

425
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:10,070
for you to lean on.

426
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:22,610
Are your hands hurt?

427
00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:23,620
You've been tied up for so long.

428
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:25,730
Of course it hurts.

429
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:29,310
Since you've broken off the engagement with Gu Qing,

430
00:23:29,630 --> 00:23:32,520
why did the Elder Jin Shan save my father?

431
00:23:33,170 --> 00:23:34,630
And as to the rumor in the martial world

432
00:23:35,650 --> 00:23:37,750
about Xixuan Sect's uniting in marriage

433
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:38,610
with Yun Zhong Ju. What's that about?

434
00:23:39,490 --> 00:23:41,320
I've asked around about it.

435
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:46,470
It's that Senior Qiushui married Miss Shi Ji.

436
00:23:47,110 --> 00:23:49,270
That's why Elder Jin Shan saved your father.

437
00:23:50,130 --> 00:23:51,790
When did they fall in love?

438
00:23:52,370 --> 00:23:53,570
How would I know?

439
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:55,320
You can ask them later.

440
00:23:59,050 --> 00:24:01,910
I'm sorry for you.

441
00:24:03,190 --> 00:24:04,870
You were forced to get married

442
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:06,030
to save my father.

443
00:24:06,890 --> 00:24:08,010
You even couldn't explain.

444
00:24:10,510 --> 00:24:12,090
Still, I kept criticizing you,

445
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:13,670
beating you, scolding you

446
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:17,920
and pushing you away.

447
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:24,040
I even stabbed you that day.

448
00:24:27,650 --> 00:24:28,770
I'm sorry, Ruochen.

449
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:33,780
I'm sorry.

450
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:36,360
Don't you have anything else to say

451
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:38,330
except for this?

452
00:25:07,530 --> 00:25:08,170
Actually,

453
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:10,960
I miss you so much every day.

454
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:14,810
Me too.

455
00:25:27,550 --> 00:25:28,380
Don't blame

456
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:30,890
my mother.

457
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:34,540
I won't blame her.

458
00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:38,260
Anyway,

459
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:40,020
we've reconciled.

460
00:25:40,990 --> 00:25:42,300
That's the happiest thing.

461
00:25:49,290 --> 00:25:52,310
Let's find a way out first.

462
00:25:54,210 --> 00:25:54,550
Okay.

463
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:19,150
Success lies in human effort,

464
00:26:19,370 --> 00:26:20,600
while the outcome is determined by fate.

465
00:26:21,530 --> 00:26:23,300
By accommodating the immense Mount Sumeru within a tiny mustard seed,

466
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:25,900
one can possess countless treasures in the world.

467
00:26:39,370 --> 00:26:40,470
I can't believe it.

468
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:42,420
Why is it so cold tonight?

469
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:52,190
Who?

470
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:53,210
Who's there?

471
00:26:58,900 --> 00:26:59,340
Who?

472
00:27:02,650 --> 00:27:04,840
I'm Ji Bingxian, the disciple of Changyang Palace of Xixuan.

473
00:27:05,650 --> 00:27:07,150
Tell your Hierarch to come out!

474
00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:08,350
Report!

475
00:27:10,050 --> 00:27:11,900
Master, someone of Xixuan Sect came to attack.

476
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:13,660
So soon?

477
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:15,310
How many people are there?

478
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:17,200
One and a half.

479
00:27:17,550 --> 00:27:18,230
One and a half?

480
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,050
Why is there a half one?

481
00:27:20,350 --> 00:27:21,590
The other one seems to be unable to fight.

482
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:22,670
He looks like a loser.

483
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:23,700
Then why should I be afraid of them?

484
00:27:24,350 --> 00:27:25,770
Senior, I'll meet them first.

485
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:27,480
Don't be careless.

486
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:28,940
Let's go.

487
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:29,970
-Yes.
-Yes.

488
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:54,820
Xuxuan from Qingxu Sect greets Lord Daluo.

489
00:27:55,430 --> 00:27:56,600
As you expected,

490
00:27:56,900 --> 00:28:00,210
Xixuan Sect did send someone to Mount Luoran to attack.

491
00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:01,410
In that case,

492
00:28:02,010 --> 00:28:03,850
I believe you're well-prepared.

493
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:06,200
Why don't you take this opportunity

494
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:07,760
to kill them,

495
00:28:08,410 --> 00:28:10,210
so that those old men can know

496
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:11,910
that not all sects

497
00:28:12,070 --> 00:28:14,090
are obedient to Xixuan Sect.

498
00:28:14,730 --> 00:28:17,220
We Luoran School has already broken up with Xixuan Sect.

499
00:28:17,470 --> 00:28:18,860
I won't be polite to them.

500
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:20,660
But

501
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:24,170
if we can get help from Qingxu Sect,

502
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:26,110
we'll be more powerful.

503
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:28,120
It's more likely for us to win.

504
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:29,650
Don't worry.

505
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:31,920
It's Qingxu's duty to destroy Xixuan.

506
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:42,630
[Luoran's Treasure Land]

507
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:45,080
How dare you!

508
00:28:46,050 --> 00:28:47,670
How dare you ruin our name sign!

509
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:49,940
I will crush you to ashes tonight.

510
00:28:50,290 --> 00:28:51,780
You people from Luoran School

511
00:28:51,810 --> 00:28:52,990
are so poor.

512
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:54,610
Look.

513
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,190
This is your mountain gate.

514
00:28:56,210 --> 00:28:57,270
Why didn't you pave the road?

515
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:58,820
What's with all these stones?

516
00:28:59,100 --> 00:28:59,970
It's so rough.

517
00:28:59,470 --> 00:29:00,330
[Luoran]

518
00:29:00,490 --> 00:29:00,850
You...

519
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:05,160
Your sect is really generous.

520
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:08,850
I wonder if they can afford to buy you a coffin.

521
00:29:10,410 --> 00:29:12,130
We're much more generous than you.

522
00:29:12,790 --> 00:29:13,750
I

523
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:16,600
have prepared the coffins for you.

524
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:18,790
This character "Luo" is for you.

525
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:20,440
This "Ran" is for him.

526
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:23,280
Attack!

527
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:25,370
Senior!

528
00:29:25,590 --> 00:29:26,100
Senior!

529
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:27,560
Second Master.

530
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:29,610
Killing this pretty boy

531
00:29:30,210 --> 00:29:31,340
wouldn't make much of a difference.

532
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:33,930
But this ice queen,

533
00:29:35,350 --> 00:29:36,110
in my opinion,

534
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:38,010
is one of the best in the world.

535
00:29:38,830 --> 00:29:41,690
Why don't we keep her and have fun?

536
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:42,770
Sir,

537
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:45,720
misfortune comes from mouth.

538
00:29:53,690 --> 00:29:54,700
Attack!

539
00:30:17,370 --> 00:30:18,220
Such fast swordsmanship!

540
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:21,320
You're too slow.

541
00:30:21,890 --> 00:30:22,280
Retreat!

542
00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:26,020
What?

543
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:47,900
Come in.

544
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:51,010
Come on.

545
00:30:56,410 --> 00:30:57,710
Young God, it's cold at night.

546
00:30:58,030 --> 00:30:59,820
Senior asked me to add a pot for you

547
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:00,650
to warm you up.

548
00:31:01,910 --> 00:31:02,810
Thank Fairy Gu for me.

549
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:03,980
Yes.

550
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:13,140
Young God, what's wrong?

551
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:16,320
I'm fine.

552
00:31:17,210 --> 00:31:18,110
It's just an old problem.

553
00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:20,280
I thought it's getting better,

554
00:31:21,030 --> 00:31:23,210
but it’s getting worse these days.

555
00:31:24,850 --> 00:31:25,920
Thank you, Miss Tan.

556
00:31:30,990 --> 00:31:31,880
Did you see it clearly?

557
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:33,540
Yes.

558
00:31:42,770 --> 00:31:43,540
You go back first.

559
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:44,720
Yes.

560
00:31:58,530 --> 00:31:59,000
Qing.

561
00:32:04,050 --> 00:32:04,780
Why are you here?

562
00:32:06,610 --> 00:32:07,540
I heard you're sick.

563
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:08,970
I'm here to check on you.

564
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:12,440
It's just a minor injury.

565
00:32:13,250 --> 00:32:13,660
It doesn't matter.

566
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:15,780
You must have been injured by the dreadstar

567
00:32:15,950 --> 00:32:17,430
by the Hao River.

568
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:19,500
It hurt your primordial spirit and deity prowess.

569
00:32:19,970 --> 00:32:20,880
How is this a minor injury?

570
00:32:25,530 --> 00:32:26,210
Eat this.

571
00:32:31,870 --> 00:32:32,550
What is this?

572
00:32:33,490 --> 00:32:34,160
The Golden Elixir.

573
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:36,480
It's a secret elixir made by Yun Zhong Ju.

574
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:38,300
It can heal your internal injury

575
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:39,830
and restore your magical prowess.

576
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:49,280
Why is this medicine so bitter?

577
00:32:54,150 --> 00:32:56,070
I didn't expect a banished god

578
00:32:56,250 --> 00:32:57,180
would be afraid of bitterness.

579
00:33:01,310 --> 00:33:01,990
Qing.

580
00:33:03,470 --> 00:33:05,140
I haven't seen you smile for a long time.

581
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:08,660
It's so long that I forgot that you look so beautiful

582
00:33:09,060 --> 00:33:10,140
when you smile.

583
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:18,860
I was kind enough to heal you.

584
00:33:19,460 --> 00:33:20,290
But now,

585
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:21,450
it's wasted.

586
00:33:22,810 --> 00:33:24,380
I’d better let Tan make medicine for you.

587
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:26,190
Qing, give me another one.

588
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:47,660
It's been a few days,

589
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:49,100
you've mastered the spirit.

590
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:50,740
Soon,

591
00:33:51,410 --> 00:33:52,630
you can transform into an immortal.

592
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:57,960
Will you still accompany me to read and rest then?

593
00:35:30,750 --> 00:35:31,790
You poor thing.

594
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:33,090
It must hurt.

595
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:40,480
No.

596
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:48,590
Bluestone God.

597
00:35:49,110 --> 00:35:50,750
You secretly released the Great Heavenly Demon.

598
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:52,450
This is a serious crime.

599
00:35:52,890 --> 00:35:54,790
Now I will cast you into the impure world

600
00:35:55,470 --> 00:35:57,880
to endure the suffering of countless tribulations.

601
00:35:58,350 --> 00:36:02,240
Return to the God Realm after a hundred lifetimes.

602
00:36:02,270 --> 00:36:03,590
Heavenly Emperor, please don't.

603
00:36:05,110 --> 00:36:05,580
Qing.

604
00:36:06,610 --> 00:36:07,660
It's only a hundred lifetimes.

605
00:36:11,130 --> 00:36:13,120
The heaven and earth are the witnesses and the bluestone is the evidence.

606
00:36:13,670 --> 00:36:15,620
We will meet again someday.

607
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:27,290
Qing.

608
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:39,880
Qing.

609
00:36:40,470 --> 00:36:42,850
You've accompanied me for ten thousands of years by the Wuding River.

610
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:45,050
How can I stand by and watch?

611
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:47,740
How can I let you bear

612
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:49,930
countless tribulations alone?

613
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:53,020
Qing.

614
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:54,310
Wait for me.

615
00:36:56,910 --> 00:36:58,560
Border Patrol God.
