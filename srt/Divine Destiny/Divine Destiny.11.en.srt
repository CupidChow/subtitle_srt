[Divine Destiny]

00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:37,970
[Episode 11]

4
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:57,350
Sir.

5
00:01:57,789 --> 00:01:59,530
I'm Zhang Yinyin. I'm passing by.

6
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:00,720
I'm really thirsty.

7
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:01,950
I want to get some water from you.

8
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:05,200
Do you know how to play Go?

9
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:06,990
No.

10
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:08,699
Boring.

11
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:12,670
The Heaven is boring. The Earth is boring.

12
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:15,070
The sea is boring, and the people are boring.

13
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:17,440
Me too.

14
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:19,130
What a weirdo.

15
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:20,810
I don't mind if you don't give me water.

16
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:22,740
And you said many useless words.

17
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:24,630
I'd better find water on my own.

18
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:36,020
What...

19
00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:37,440
Aren't you Ling?

20
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:38,150
You're back.

21
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:40,250
Why are you here?

22
00:02:57,730 --> 00:02:58,730
So

23
00:02:58,750 --> 00:02:59,780
after all this time,

24
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:01,130
I just rowed myself back.

25
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:17,810
Mr. Wu,

26
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,470
I know your place is big.

27
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:20,780
Show me a way.

28
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:21,950
How can I get out?

29
00:03:22,079 --> 00:03:22,810
You can't.

30
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,400
Qingyi is cultivating her power again.

31
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:26,640
If it weren't for you,

32
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:29,380
she wouldn't have gotten involved in what happened in Haofang

33
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:30,730
and disturbed her mind.

34
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:34,160
Now no one is here to chat with me to relieve my boredom.

35
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:35,440
Since you're here,

36
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:37,660
why don't you take her place?

37
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:40,000
Are you kidding me?

38
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,320
I'm the chief disciple of the Taixuan Palace of Xixuan Sect.

39
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:44,110
I ranked first in the Annual Exam and ranked first on the Qingyun List.

40
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:45,490
How can I stay here to play Go with you?

41
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:49,460
What about Xixuan Sect?

42
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:51,260
It's been years

43
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:53,079
since Ziwei

44
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,430
passed the death calamity.

45
00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:56,000
But has he ascended to a High Immortal?

46
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:59,680
He always goes out whenever there's any trouble.

47
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:01,320
He's not determined at all.

48
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:02,780
You can joke with me.

49
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:04,220
But how dare you insult our hierarch!

50
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:28,700
Master.

51
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:31,650
So you are Su He's disciple.

52
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:34,230
You are not that ignorant.

53
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,840
My master is the Nine-Tailed Heavenly Fox.

54
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:36,490
Are you afraid?

55
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,010
After hiding for a thousand years,

56
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:39,560
I still can't hide from it.

57
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,400
Then let me out.

58
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:42,159
When she comes,

59
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:43,580
she will make the Endless Sea disappear.

60
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:44,580
No, no.

61
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,920
If she comes, everything will be over.

62
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:48,870
What are you waiting for?

63
00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:49,880
Send me out.

64
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:55,510
If that's the case, I can't let you out.

65
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:57,500
If you inform her

66
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:58,650
and stir up trouble,

67
00:04:58,760 --> 00:04:59,600
what should I do?

68
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,450
You

69
00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:02,790
stay here.

70
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,840
Here again?

71
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:41,670
Xichen.

72
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,050
Xichen, where are you going?

73
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:47,820
Luo Feng.

74
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:01,710
Did I mistake him for Luo Feng?

75
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:14,520
Feng.

76
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:17,080
It's you. It's really you.

77
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,770
Luo Feng you mentioned

78
00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:30,500
died in the inn outside the city long ago.

79
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:33,620
The person in front of you is Yinfeng.

80
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:36,300
Now that I have regained my consciousness of god,

81
00:06:37,159 --> 00:06:38,650
I will definitely return to the God Realm in the future.

82
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:40,580
Both you and I

83
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:41,860
should forget

84
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:43,730
what's in the past.

85
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:47,340
Luo Feng.

86
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:49,110
What are you talking about?

87
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:50,790
Who is Yinfeng?

88
00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:52,340
What God Realm?

89
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:55,150
You are Young Master Luo of the Luo Mansion in Haofang.

90
00:06:57,730 --> 00:06:58,409
Not anymore.

91
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,270
I'm a banished god now.

92
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:05,340
I've cut ties with everything in the mortal world.

93
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:08,380
What about me?

94
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:12,930
Have you also cut ties with me?

95
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:15,420
I gave up everything

96
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:17,190
for you.

97
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:20,130
If you abandon me,

98
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:22,280
where can I go?

99
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:24,360
You already have the King of Haofang, Li An, right?

100
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:27,870
High position and great wealth are within your reach.

101
00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:29,400
This is

102
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:31,390
good for you.

103
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:41,930
You were right.

104
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:45,870
You are not him.

105
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:48,420
Feng

106
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:50,900
is dead.

107
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:54,770
It was all my wishful thinking. I deserve it.

108
00:07:58,730 --> 00:07:59,420
Leave.

109
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:02,600
Go back to the God Realm.

110
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:33,690
This is the Book of Heaven.

111
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:35,720
I'll give you one volume.

112
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:37,700
But you should know

113
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,679
I have repaid

114
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:41,590
what I owed you.

115
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:43,580
From now on,

116
00:08:45,010 --> 00:08:45,850
we have nothing to do with each other.

117
00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:10,000
Feng.

118
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:11,420
Xichen.

119
00:09:11,530 --> 00:09:12,570
Feng.

120
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:13,290
Xichen.

121
00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:15,140
Why are you here?

122
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:16,030
Feng.

123
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:30,440
Oh no.

124
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,270
You lost all your divine energy.

125
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:34,480
There is no difference between you and a mortal now.

126
00:09:35,210 --> 00:09:36,270
You insisted on inviting Master to come here.

127
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:38,520
What should you do if he feels uncomfortable out of anger?

128
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:41,340
You are so silly.

129
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:42,940
No matter how important your divine destiny is,

130
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,570
you shouldn't lose your dharma-laksana

131
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,590
for Ji Ruochen.

132
00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:47,110
Master.

133
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:49,210
What's done is done.

134
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,180
It's too late to regret.

135
00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:53,670
I was wrong.

136
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:56,380
I shouldn't have spoiled you.

137
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:57,720
No.

138
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,730
I can't just let this go.

139
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:01,900
Ziyang

140
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:02,890
is good at playing tricks.

141
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:04,740
He just can't stand it because Yun Zhong Ju

142
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:06,400
has surpassed Xixuan Sect.

143
00:10:06,530 --> 00:10:08,120
So he used Ji Ruochen as a bait

144
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:09,610
to make you lose your dharma-laksana.

145
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:10,770
I'm so angry.

146
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:12,230
I'm going to see him.

147
00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:14,280
Ziyang.

148
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:16,030
Ziyang.

149
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:18,580
Ziyang!

150
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:20,280
Where is he?

151
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:21,700
-Bro?
-Ziyang.

152
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:23,560
Ziyang.

153
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:24,320
Jin Shan.

154
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:25,890
Ziyang.

155
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:27,640
Jin Shan.

156
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:30,600
Welcome, Hierarch Jin Shan.

157
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:31,380
Cut it out.

158
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:32,940
Through the battle in Haofang,

159
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:35,410
Xixuan earned fame and the treasure.

160
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:35,950
Look at us.

161
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:37,500
I lost a fairy.

162
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:38,280
Yes.

163
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:40,170
I'm here to ask you to give me an explanation.

164
00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:41,500
If you don't,

165
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:42,930
I'll go to your senior.

166
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:44,140
I'll talk to him.

167
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:45,850
Bro. Bro. Bro.

168
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:46,780
Wait.

169
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:48,980
Please calm down.

170
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:51,580
Let's talk it over, okay?

171
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:52,500
No need.

172
00:10:52,650 --> 00:10:54,010
Just give me a solution.

173
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:56,900
Bro.

174
00:10:57,700 --> 00:11:00,450
In order to save my disciple Ruochen,

175
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:02,800
Fairy Gu Qing lost her dharma-laksana.

176
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:05,370
She won't have a chance to return to the God Realm.

177
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:08,020
Xixuan Sect will never forget

178
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:11,130
her sacrifice.

179
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:13,940
On behalf of my disciple Ruochen,

180
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:16,300
I deliver my gratitude to Fairy Gu Qing

181
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:17,760
and Yun Zhong Ju.

182
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:25,770
That's it?

183
00:11:27,650 --> 00:11:29,620
Your solution is bowing to me?

184
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:32,540
Don't forget that

185
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:34,930
Qing and Ji Ruochen are engaged.

186
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:37,250
I know what you think.

187
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:40,210
You think Qing is no different from a mortal.

188
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:41,870
She doesn't deserve a banished god.

189
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:43,330
So you want to go back on your words

190
00:11:43,530 --> 00:11:45,780
and cancel the engagement.

191
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:47,250
How could you say that?

192
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:48,730
Yes.

193
00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:51,480
Xixuan did gain fame through the battle in Haofang.

194
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,600
But we also offended many people.

195
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:55,870
I'm afraid there won't be peace anymore

196
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:57,650
in Xixuan Mountains.

197
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:01,250
I'd love to become relatives with Yun Zhong Ju through their marriage

198
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,760
considering the situation.

199
00:12:03,450 --> 00:12:03,880
Bro.

200
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:05,420
If you don't mind,

201
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:08,270
we can choose an auspicious date as soon as possible,

202
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:10,480
so that my disciple can marry Gu Qing

203
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:12,970
to repay her.

204
00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:14,250
What do you think?

205
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:14,880
Good.

206
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:17,010
However,

207
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:17,930
I'm afraid...

208
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:18,440
What are you afraid of?

209
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:21,400
If you're afraid that Xixuan Sect will get you implicated,

210
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:22,590
just forget what I said.

211
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:24,280
What a joke.

212
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:26,490
When did Yun Zhong Ju ever fear

213
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:27,730
those evil sects?

214
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:29,420
Then what are you afraid of?

215
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:30,330
I'm afraid...

216
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:33,690
I've heard

217
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:34,900
Ji Ruochen has fallen in love with

218
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:37,740
Jingxiao Zhenren's daughter.

219
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:40,080
-I'm afraid Ji Ruochen will…
-He dare not.

220
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:41,780
He is my disciple.

221
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:44,970
He's the one in Xixuan who should face the calamity.

222
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:47,110
He has the responsibility of promoting the sect

223
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:49,250
and saving the Three Realms.

224
00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:51,530
Marriage is important.

225
00:12:51,710 --> 00:12:53,470
He can't make the decision himself.

226
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:56,800
His master should make the decision for him.

227
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:00,030
Does your disciple Ji Ruochen

228
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:03,180
look like someone who obeys his master?

229
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,880
She saved his life.

230
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:06,470
He has to repay her.

231
00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:07,640
It's not up to him.

232
00:13:08,730 --> 00:13:09,520
Besides,

233
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:12,560
he owes a bigger favor.

234
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:14,580
What?

235
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:24,950
Nice!

236
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:28,360
I lost a fairy first.

237
00:13:28,430 --> 00:13:30,670
Now you want to take the secret technique of Yun Zhong Ju.

238
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:31,750
I knew

239
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:33,250
I'd be fooled by you sooner or later.

240
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,010
I only care about

241
00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:36,020
the future of Xixuan Sect and Yun Zhong Ju.

242
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:37,690
I have no selfish motives.

243
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:40,620
Hierarch Jin Shan. Please.

244
00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:47,180
Fine.

245
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:48,560
For Qing,

246
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:51,220
I'm willing to do anything.

247
00:13:51,690 --> 00:13:52,560
You are very kind.

248
00:13:53,090 --> 00:13:54,450
But I have one condition.

249
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,440
As long as I can do it,

250
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:56,730
I'll do my best.

251
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:58,340
You must

252
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:00,550
invite all sects to Qing's wedding.

253
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:02,330
It will be a grand wedding.

254
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:04,380
She won't feel wronged.

255
00:14:07,730 --> 00:14:10,160
Let's make this clear.

256
00:14:10,930 --> 00:14:14,920
Xixuan Sect begged Yun Zhong Ju

257
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:16,430
for this marriage.

258
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:18,700
I agree.

259
00:14:19,850 --> 00:14:21,530
The Endless Sea is a legend.

260
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:23,300
No one knows where it is.

261
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:24,260
How are you going to find it?

262
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:26,430
Qingyi told me about it before.

263
00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:27,260
So

264
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:29,460
I think I may be able to find some clues.

265
00:14:30,010 --> 00:14:30,360
Really?

266
00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:32,540
It's great

267
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:33,170
if you can bring Yinyin back.

268
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:35,550
I really miss her.

269
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,190
Take the medicine.

270
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:38,470
Thank you.

271
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:40,640
By the way,

272
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:42,740
you should pay attention to your health.

273
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:45,100
Gu Qing transferred her dharma-laksana to you

274
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:47,390
to temporarily stop the aftereffect of the Dreadstar Fate-Infusion Technique,

275
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:47,890
but

276
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:49,710
this is just a temporary measure.

277
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:50,510
Yes.

278
00:14:51,130 --> 00:14:52,010
Speaking of Gu Qing,

279
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:53,660
when we heard you two were engaged,

280
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:55,350
Qiushui and I were worried.

281
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:57,910
But after knowing you and Yinyin

282
00:14:58,340 --> 00:14:59,340
love each other so deeply,

283
00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:00,990
we can rest assured.

284
00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:02,930
Don't worry.

285
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:04,450
I'm fine now.

286
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:05,470
Don't worry.

287
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,200
I hope so.

288
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:19,940
Senior.

289
00:15:20,610 --> 00:15:22,280
What can I do for you?

290
00:15:23,170 --> 00:15:23,980
Master said

291
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:26,060
Senior Ruochen needs time to recover.

292
00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:27,280
So he ordered us to come here

293
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:28,400
to be at your disposal.

294
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:30,780
Thank you.

295
00:15:31,290 --> 00:15:32,470
Sorry to bother you.

296
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:49,020
What is it?

297
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:52,590
It seems that I can't go to the Endless Sea.

298
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:57,340
I wonder how Ruochen is now.

299
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:01,040
And my father, my mother,

300
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,610
Xuanzhen, and Shui.

301
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:10,200
You scared me.

302
00:16:10,430 --> 00:16:11,500
Why are you standing there?

303
00:16:11,530 --> 00:16:12,370
Don't you need to sleep?

304
00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:17,940
My master created me with monster arts.

305
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:18,820
I have no soul or spirit.

306
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:22,290
So I feel nothing. I don't sleep or eat.

307
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:24,640
Of course I don't need to sleep.

308
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:27,860
How can I sleep if you stand there?

309
00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:29,250
I'm not the reason why you can't sleep.

310
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:31,510
You can't sleep because of Ruochen, Xuanzhen,

311
00:16:31,830 --> 00:16:33,470
your father, your mother, and Shui.

312
00:16:33,810 --> 00:16:34,550
Enough.

313
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:37,010
You win.

314
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:41,620
Remove the barrier and take a walk with me.

315
00:17:19,859 --> 00:17:20,819
Sit with me for a while.

316
00:17:22,359 --> 00:17:27,400
♫Moonlight clear as snow, my thoughts are hidden♫

317
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:31,920
♫Who plays a farewell tune in the alley♫

318
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:40,500
♫Lovesickness is like a butterfly. Floral fragrance fading away♫

319
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:36,800
Look.

320
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:38,960
The moon is so beautiful.

321
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:48,840
♫Robes swirling, intoxicated, dancing to a poetic verse♫

322
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:55,520
♫Moonlight bright as snow, loneliness fills the long street♫

323
00:17:56,190 --> 00:18:00,090
♫Shadows remain while forms intertwine with belief♫

324
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:09,120
♫Bustling sounds vanish between branches and leaves♫

325
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:16,990
♫Emotions turning, tears unseen♫

326
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:23,880
♫I feel as if I'm distant from this bustling world of crowds♫

327
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:28,610
♫Frowning, heart aching, love and hate entwined♫

328
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:34,380
♫Your tenderness separated by distance and time♫

329
00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:41,230
♫And I can only embrace myself in care♫

330
00:18:41,490 --> 00:18:47,110
♫As the dim lights fade away, troubles come to a halt♫

331
00:18:47,310 --> 00:18:51,870
♫Still entangled with many emotional trials♫

332
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:58,070
♫You wrote a letter to make an appointment with me♫

333
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:06,100
♫Leaving a startled glimpse in my heart♫

334
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:00,260
Ling.

335
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:02,370
Do you have someone you like?

336
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:07,940
Someone I like?

337
00:19:11,370 --> 00:19:12,130
What does that mean?

338
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,690
No matter where you are

339
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:20,180
or what you do,

340
00:19:21,690 --> 00:19:24,540
you want to see her every day and night.

341
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:27,310
In order to meet her,

342
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:31,770
you are not afraid of

343
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:33,660
the distance or challenges.

344
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:40,500
Yes.

345
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:42,090
My master.

346
00:19:44,890 --> 00:19:46,570
I'm not talking about this.

347
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:48,580
I mean

348
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:52,900
the person you are hiding here carefully.

349
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:01,690
The person I'm hiding here?

350
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:10,700
Who is that person?

351
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:25,340
Dragon Elephant. White Tiger.

352
00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:26,690
Are you okay?

353
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:27,760
Hurry. Get up.

354
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:29,620
Are you okay?

355
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:33,330
-My Cannon!
-What are you two doing?

356
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:34,520
It's been so many days.

357
00:20:34,550 --> 00:20:35,590
Why didn't you come to me?

358
00:20:36,270 --> 00:20:37,440
Master lent the warehouse of the Endless Sea

359
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:38,540
to us.

360
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:40,520
We can use whatever

361
00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:41,300
in the warehouse.

362
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:43,380
It's not that we didn't want to see you.

363
00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:45,160
We're busy improving the Universal Cannon.

364
00:20:46,290 --> 00:20:47,370
An accident happened,

365
00:20:47,490 --> 00:20:48,640
and it has become like this.

366
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:50,040
It's all your fault.

367
00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:51,840
I told you to ignite it later.

368
00:20:51,870 --> 00:20:52,830
How can you blame me?

369
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:53,820
-I told you.
-It's all your fault.

370
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:54,480
Enough.

371
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:55,070
Stop arguing.

372
00:20:55,690 --> 00:20:57,050
Can you two be more ambitious?

373
00:20:57,260 --> 00:20:59,030
You called him Master, just because he gave you treasures.

374
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:00,280
What a bootlicker.

375
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:02,920
Well. Yinyin.

376
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:04,390
The owner of the Endless Sea

377
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:05,440
is the master of all monsters.

378
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:07,870
If we become his men,

379
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:09,190
we won't have to worry about

380
00:21:10,670 --> 00:21:12,000
the rest of our lives.

381
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:14,280
I can't stand you two.

382
00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:16,340
When do you plan to leave?

383
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:19,320
Well...

384
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:22,800
What? You don't want to leave?

385
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:27,800
You blew up the warehouse.

386
00:21:27,930 --> 00:21:29,140
These treasures are scattered all over the place.

387
00:21:29,370 --> 00:21:31,160
Do you think he will spare you two?

388
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:32,940
Right.

389
00:21:33,870 --> 00:21:35,040
Do you think he will

390
00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:36,980
treat us like how he treated Qingyi?

391
00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:39,560
Will he put us in the Ice Prison

392
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:40,620
and torture us?

393
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:41,990
What happened to Qingyi?

394
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:46,190
You tell her.

395
00:21:47,910 --> 00:21:49,040
Yinyin.

396
00:21:49,230 --> 00:21:50,620
You were in a coma.

397
00:21:50,650 --> 00:21:51,930
So you didn't know.

398
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:53,220
Qingyi

399
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:54,250
offended the owner of the Endless Sea

400
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:56,460
because of her trip to Haofang.

401
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:58,110
So she was thrown into the Ice Prison

402
00:21:58,410 --> 00:22:00,450
to suffer.

403
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:02,550
Where is the Ice Prison?

404
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:04,720
At the bottom of the Endless Sea.

405
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:07,860
Every day, Qingyi needs to purify her heart with blood

406
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:09,920
and practice her skills with ice pitons piercing her bones.

407
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:11,470
Master said

408
00:22:11,850 --> 00:22:12,470
only in this way

409
00:22:12,890 --> 00:22:14,360
can she cut ties with everything in the mortal world.

410
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:16,490
Isn't your master her uncle?

411
00:22:16,890 --> 00:22:17,970
Why did he do that to her?

412
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:20,630
Qingyi volunteered to go.

413
00:22:21,170 --> 00:22:21,830
Yinyin.

414
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:23,440
Qingyi getting punished

415
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,720
is a family matter of the Endless Sea.

416
00:22:26,090 --> 00:22:28,460
We can't do anything about it.

417
00:22:28,490 --> 00:22:29,080
Right.

418
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:30,760
He is abusive.

419
00:22:31,270 --> 00:22:32,400
I must intervene.

420
00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:35,720
When can you fix the Universal Cannon at the soonest?

421
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:37,830
Well...

422
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:38,580
Well...

423
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:40,260
Ling.

424
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:42,300
Deliver a message to your master.

425
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:44,600
I, Zhang Yinyin,

426
00:22:44,810 --> 00:22:46,130
want to fight with him decently.

427
00:22:51,690 --> 00:22:52,380
Juniors.

428
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:54,190
Senior Qiushui.

429
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:55,390
Thank you for guarding this place.

430
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:57,120
In the middle of the night,

431
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,310
it's easy to catch a cold.

432
00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:00,430
I specially made this soup

433
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:02,310
for you.

434
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:03,800
-I'm hungry.
-Come with me to have a taste.

435
00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:04,750
Come. Don't stand on ceremony.

436
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:05,540
Let's go.

437
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:06,830
If this is not enough, there is more in the kitchen.

438
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:13,580
Is my medicine so effective?

439
00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:17,110
They all passed out?

440
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:18,120
Yes.

441
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:18,740
Am I good?

442
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:19,840
You're amazing.

443
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:21,560
Do you plan to open an illegal restaurant?

444
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:22,680
You can make a fortune.

445
00:23:23,010 --> 00:23:23,820
You are wrong.

446
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:25,310
Qiushui doesn't need it.

447
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,530
As the saying goes, be thrifty at home and spend liberally while traveling.

448
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:30,440
I'm giving you a little money.

449
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:31,200
You can use it on your way.

450
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:32,950
Take it.

451
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:38,160
Did you call this a little money?

452
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:41,100
Do you know how many illegal restaurants you can open with the money?

453
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:42,010
I'm not taking it.

454
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:42,690
Just take it.

455
00:23:42,710 --> 00:23:43,590
Take it.

456
00:23:43,870 --> 00:23:45,980
His family has run money shops for generations.

457
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:46,980
He has a lot of money.

458
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:48,700
When he first came here,

459
00:23:48,890 --> 00:23:50,520
some of the masters fought fiercely with each other

460
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:51,820
to make him their disciple.

461
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:52,930
It's not worth mentioning.

462
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:55,640
Alright, it's getting late.

463
00:23:55,910 --> 00:23:56,560
Go now.

464
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:58,040
It's a long journey.

465
00:23:58,180 --> 00:23:59,060
You must take care.

466
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:01,340
Ruochen,

467
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:03,170
you have money now.

468
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:04,600
If you and Yinyin

469
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:06,270
find a better place

470
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:08,910
where you can be free and happy,

471
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:11,140
you don't have to come back.

472
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:12,590
What are you talking about?

473
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:14,550
All right, I'm leaving.

474
00:24:14,970 --> 00:24:15,350
Okay.

475
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:23,710
Why is he here again?

476
00:24:30,890 --> 00:24:31,380
Ruochen.

477
00:24:32,230 --> 00:24:34,380
You took the responsibility of eliminating the demon in Haofang.

478
00:24:34,870 --> 00:24:37,840
I really envy you.

479
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:40,810
Many people can't have such a chance even if they want.

480
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:43,230
So you should cherish it more

481
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:44,560
and live up to the expectations

482
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:47,200
of Master and other Zhenren.

483
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:49,160
Senior.

484
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:51,300
What are you talking about?

485
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,490
I've killed Bamboo Snake.

486
00:24:55,250 --> 00:24:55,930
I know.

487
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:57,930
But if I didn't come today,

488
00:24:58,460 --> 00:25:00,080
would you leave without saying goodbye?

489
00:25:01,730 --> 00:25:03,020
No.

490
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:04,470
I'm just going out.

491
00:25:04,850 --> 00:25:06,970
I'm going to take Yinyin back to Xixuan.

492
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:08,430
Yinyin is still waiting for me.

493
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:09,940
If there's nothing else,

494
00:25:10,070 --> 00:25:11,650
I'm leaving.

495
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:21,170
I haven't used this for years.

496
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:22,920
I'm a little unfamiliar with it.

497
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:25,080
Senior.

498
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:27,910
What do you want?

499
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:32,520
I know you love Yinyin so much.

500
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:34,400
If you insist on leaving here,

501
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:35,990
I have no choice.

502
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:39,750
Are you here to force me

503
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:41,790
to get married like them?

504
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,200
No.

505
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:46,610
Then why?

506
00:25:49,690 --> 00:25:50,840
Master asked me to ask you

507
00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:53,710
if you forgot to give something important

508
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:54,710
to him.

509
00:25:55,790 --> 00:25:56,920
That's it?

510
00:25:57,210 --> 00:25:59,050
Why didn't you finish it all at once?

511
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:01,440
What is the thing that I haven't given to him?

512
00:26:02,350 --> 00:26:02,900
Think about it.

513
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:08,160
The Shenzhou Energy Map?

514
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:10,240
What?

515
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:13,980
Ling told me that you wanted to fight with me.

516
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:16,080
I have no other choice.

517
00:26:16,330 --> 00:26:17,230
I don't want to stay here

518
00:26:17,390 --> 00:26:18,250
anymore.

519
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,120
Why don't we have a fight?

520
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:21,900
If I win,

521
00:26:22,050 --> 00:26:23,150
you need to let me go.

522
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:25,170
And you need to let Dragon Elephant, White Tiger, and Qingyi

523
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:26,550
go with me.

524
00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:28,720
Who are Dragon Tiger and White Elephant?

525
00:26:28,810 --> 00:26:29,850
We are Dragon Elephant and White...

526
00:26:30,570 --> 00:26:31,460
The two people

527
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:33,510
who blew up your warehouse last night.

528
00:26:35,410 --> 00:26:36,070
Don't be afraid.

529
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:37,730
I can see it.

530
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:39,260
This mask man

531
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:41,320
doesn't dare to leave this tree.

532
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:43,980
You can aim the Universal Cannon at him.

533
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:45,570
I'm sure no shot will be wasted.

534
00:26:46,510 --> 00:26:46,880
OK.

535
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:49,500
After you were brought here by Qingyi,

536
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:52,220
you caused an explosion. And now you want to fight.

537
00:26:53,650 --> 00:26:54,800
My island has become lively.

538
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:58,050
If I let you all go,

539
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,610
Ling and I

540
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:01,300
will be left alone.

541
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:03,000
No.

542
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:05,620
I can't agree to any of your conditions.

543
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:07,480
Even if you win,

544
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:09,810
I won't let you go.

545
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:13,090
There are rules in the martial arts world.

546
00:27:13,190 --> 00:27:14,830
If you lose, you have to let us go.

547
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:17,890
This is not the martial arts world.

548
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:19,800
On the Endless Sea,

549
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:22,560
I am the rules.

550
00:27:23,370 --> 00:27:25,270
But I'm Zhang Yinyin.

551
00:27:25,570 --> 00:27:27,930
You need to change your rules.

552
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:30,850
Dragon Elephant. White Tiger.

553
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:32,040
Ready the Universal Cannon.

554
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:42,110
Come on.

555
00:27:44,910 --> 00:27:46,110
Wonderful! Wonderful!

556
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:47,850
The Dragon and Tiger Universal Cannon.

557
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:04,140
Wait for me!

558
00:28:05,230 --> 00:28:06,270
These two cowards.

559
00:28:09,710 --> 00:28:10,300
No.

560
00:28:11,390 --> 00:28:12,590
Qingyi is still suffering.

561
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:14,530
Ruochen is waiting for me too.

562
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:17,080
I'm going to cut your mask into two pieces today.

563
00:28:21,850 --> 00:28:24,540
Your secret technique of the Heavenly Fox is good.

564
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:26,860
No wonder Su He made an exception to accept you as her disciple.

565
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:28,210
But

566
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:30,720
you've only learned a little.

567
00:28:31,370 --> 00:28:32,940
You want to find Qingyi, right?

568
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:34,360
Go.

569
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:43,930
Mr. Ji.

570
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:45,470
Don't move.

571
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:51,590
Qingyi.

572
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:54,040
Yinyin.

573
00:28:54,290 --> 00:28:55,050
You came at the right time.

574
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:56,390
Come and teach me how to kiss.

575
00:28:57,580 --> 00:28:58,420
Ruochen.

576
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:01,820
Ruochen.

577
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:19,020
My Ji Ruochen.

578
00:29:19,170 --> 00:29:19,770
Yinyin.

579
00:29:20,230 --> 00:29:21,970
You broke my Ji Ruochen.

580
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:23,910
You already have one.

581
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:25,050
Why can't I have one?

582
00:29:25,470 --> 00:29:26,770
Why don't you give yours to me?

583
00:29:27,310 --> 00:29:28,620
Qingyi. Good for you.

584
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:30,230
I thought you were suffering in the Ice Prison.

585
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:31,830
I didn't expect you to play here.

586
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:33,330
Why did you transform your puppet into Ji Ruochen?

587
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:34,900
And it looked like him a lot.

588
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:36,140
I'm warning you.

589
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:37,280
Don't do that again.

590
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:37,910
And

591
00:29:38,170 --> 00:29:39,260
I won't give my Ji Ruochen to you.

592
00:29:39,340 --> 00:29:40,030
Yinyin.

593
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:41,790
What you said is unreasonable.

594
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:43,340
I can transform my puppet

595
00:29:43,370 --> 00:29:44,300
into anyone.

596
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:44,990
It's none of your business.

597
00:29:45,330 --> 00:29:46,020
Besides,

598
00:29:46,170 --> 00:29:47,910
you broke my Ji Ruochen.

599
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:49,100
It's fine that you don't apologize.

600
00:29:49,230 --> 00:29:50,200
But you're so overbearing.

601
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:51,520
I even regarded you as my sister.

602
00:29:51,590 --> 00:29:52,660
Good for you.

603
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:53,380
Give it to me.

604
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:55,220
Do you believe I'm going to smash it?

605
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:55,820
Give it back!

606
00:29:55,910 --> 00:29:57,500
You are really bold. Qingyi.

607
00:29:57,580 --> 00:29:58,740
Give it back!

608
00:29:58,740 --> 00:29:59,650
Do you believe I'll beat you?

609
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:02,860
How dare you!

610
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:10,410
Master. I'm here.

611
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:11,680
Ruochen.

612
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:13,340
How are you feeling now?

613
00:30:14,290 --> 00:30:15,330
Much better now.

614
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:17,840
I'm still resting my body.

615
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:19,330
In Haofang,

616
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:21,380
you lived up to everyone's expectations and achieved success.

617
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:24,540
I haven't congratulated you yet.

618
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:28,260
Although I killed Bamboo Snake,

619
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:30,590
I don't think

620
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:33,690
I deserve your praise just now.

621
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:38,050
When I was fighting with Bamboo Snake in Haofang,

622
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:41,320
I lost the Shenzhou Energy Map.

623
00:30:41,890 --> 00:30:43,150
Sorry to disappoint you.

624
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:44,650
Master,

625
00:30:45,410 --> 00:30:46,150
please punish me.

626
00:30:46,950 --> 00:30:48,390
Do you really not know

627
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:51,110
where the Shenzhou Energy Map is?

628
00:30:58,340 --> 00:30:59,080
All right, Ruochen.

629
00:31:00,050 --> 00:31:01,220
No more nonsense.

630
00:31:01,970 --> 00:31:04,330
Give me the map now.

631
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:05,920
Master.

632
00:31:06,130 --> 00:31:08,720
The map was taken by a powerful man.

633
00:31:09,370 --> 00:31:10,630
I really don't have it.

634
00:31:12,330 --> 00:31:14,760
Did you meet two powerful people

635
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:17,740
when you were looking for the map beside the Hao River?

636
00:31:20,610 --> 00:31:22,220
I met two old friends.

637
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,150
I have something for you.

638
00:31:27,570 --> 00:31:28,330
What is this?

639
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:30,120
Don't ask. Just take it.

640
00:31:39,350 --> 00:31:40,230
Could it be...

641
00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:52,220
So the map has been with me all the time.

642
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:55,080
Xuanxin Ring isolated the spiritual energy.

643
00:31:55,450 --> 00:31:56,610
That's why I didn't notice it.

644
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:18,810
Master.

645
00:32:19,730 --> 00:32:21,410
Is this the place where

646
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,610
Shenzhou's spiritual power gathers?

647
00:32:23,810 --> 00:32:24,270
Yes.

648
00:32:24,650 --> 00:32:26,750
The place where the spiritual power gathers is called the spiritual cave.

649
00:32:27,170 --> 00:32:27,790
You are

650
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:29,400
very lucky

651
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:31,630
to feel

652
00:32:31,650 --> 00:32:33,060
the flow of the spiritual energy in the map.

653
00:32:33,710 --> 00:32:35,230
But the flow of the spiritual energy

654
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:36,140
is unstable.

655
00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:37,850
When the time is right,

656
00:32:38,250 --> 00:32:40,480
I'll tell you more.

657
00:32:51,430 --> 00:32:52,690
I asked you to recultivate your power.

658
00:32:52,710 --> 00:32:53,480
But you

659
00:32:53,510 --> 00:32:54,750
were playing.

660
00:32:55,090 --> 00:32:55,850
And you.

661
00:32:56,580 --> 00:32:57,730
You're a guest after all.

662
00:32:57,970 --> 00:32:59,620
I've showed my hospitality.

663
00:33:00,090 --> 00:33:00,670
Look at her.

664
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:02,230
What did you do to her?

665
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:05,300
It's all because you didn't teach her well.

666
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:06,250
You allowed your disciple

667
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:07,600
to do such a shameful thing.

668
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:09,330
She transformed her puppet into my fiancé

669
00:33:09,370 --> 00:33:10,240
and kissed and hugged him.

670
00:33:10,850 --> 00:33:12,170
Even I felt so embarrassed.

671
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:13,610
I learned it from you.

672
00:33:13,710 --> 00:33:15,170
You kissed Ji Ruochen.

673
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:16,780
I just thought it should taste good.

674
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:17,800
I just wanted to have a taste.

675
00:33:17,890 --> 00:33:18,640
You don't understand.

676
00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:20,900
Ruochen and I love each other.

677
00:33:23,330 --> 00:33:25,210
What does that mean?

678
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:26,140
Well...

679
00:33:26,690 --> 00:33:28,850
We have feelings for each other.

680
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:32,510
What does that mean?

681
00:33:32,630 --> 00:33:32,970
Well...

682
00:33:32,990 --> 00:33:34,820
It means someone

683
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:35,900
you are hiding here carefully.

684
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:37,080
What are you talking about?

685
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:39,580
Are you all trying to rebel?

686
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:40,540
Ling, tell me.

687
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:43,070
Who taught you that?

688
00:33:57,750 --> 00:33:58,910
Something bad will happen.

689
00:33:59,490 --> 00:34:01,370
You're just like your master.

690
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:03,080
If you stay here any longer,

691
00:34:03,230 --> 00:34:05,280
I won't find peace on this island.

692
00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:14,510
Little Fox.

693
00:34:15,380 --> 00:34:16,940
Go back to where you came from.

694
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:18,510
I'll see you out.

695
00:34:19,670 --> 00:34:21,199
My small island

696
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:23,469
is not somewhere you should stay.

697
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:25,440
You should have done this earlier.

698
00:34:25,469 --> 00:34:27,190
Isn't it good for everyone to be harmonious?

699
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:28,679
You just wouldn't listen to me.

700
00:34:29,370 --> 00:34:30,580
The Shenzhou Energy Map

701
00:34:30,750 --> 00:34:32,190
concerns the safety of the Three Realms.

702
00:34:32,690 --> 00:34:34,150
Since Xixuan has the map now,

703
00:34:34,489 --> 00:34:36,370
we can finally find a way

704
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:38,420
to survive the calamity.

705
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:42,469
From now on, the future of Xixuan Sect

706
00:34:43,230 --> 00:34:44,530
will depend on you.

707
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:47,460
Master.

708
00:34:48,989 --> 00:34:50,540
I don't think I can shoulder

709
00:34:51,350 --> 00:34:52,420
the responsibility of facing the calamity for Xixuan Sect.

710
00:34:53,170 --> 00:34:53,830
Are you scared?

711
00:34:56,020 --> 00:34:56,900
I'm not.

712
00:34:58,040 --> 00:34:59,810
I just don't want to lie to you anymore.

713
00:35:01,730 --> 00:35:02,560
I think

714
00:35:02,630 --> 00:35:03,620
you want me to

715
00:35:03,650 --> 00:35:05,640
help you refuse your marriage with Fairy Gu Qing, right?

716
00:35:10,850 --> 00:35:11,690
I'm guilty.

717
00:35:12,250 --> 00:35:13,460
Please punish me.

718
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:15,070
What guilt?

719
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:22,710
Master admitted me to Xixuan,

720
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:24,260
because I...

721
00:35:24,290 --> 00:35:25,290
Because you are a banished god.

722
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:27,440
You can promote Xixuan.

723
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:28,910
And you are the one who will face the calamity for Xixuan.

724
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:33,330
But Master,

725
00:35:35,620 --> 00:35:37,410
I'm not a banished god.

726
00:35:43,970 --> 00:35:45,490
I know.
