[Episode 10]

4
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:39,850
Boss, come out to do business.

5
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:55,420
Jinhua, come out.

6
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:57,620
They both fainted. Search this woman.

7
00:01:57,620 --> 00:01:58,220
Coming.

8
00:01:58,220 --> 00:01:59,350
See if there's anything valuable.

9
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:00,580
Coming.

10
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:05,700
She's wearing the Demon Subduing Stone.

11
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:06,520
Hurry up!

12
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:08,580
Kill her! She's a demon!

13
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:10,210
This man has no money.

14
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:11,660
He's a beggar, right?

15
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:15,460
Jinhua.

16
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:16,660
Come and see.

17
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:18,980
What's wrong?

18
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,030
Is this our brat?

19
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:29,740
He really is.

20
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:30,700
You fool.

21
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:32,180
You can't even recognize your own child

22
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:34,590
and knocked him out like he was a profitable customer.

23
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:36,380
He changes his appearance quickly as he grows up.

24
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,440
You didn't recognize him either.

25
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:38,270
Cut the crap.

26
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:40,170
Wake this brat up first.

27
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:41,000
Okay.

28
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:43,480
Hurry up.

29
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,560
Zhang, Huaniang.

30
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:00,670
Why are you two here?

31
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:04,700
You almost knocked me to death.

32
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:05,700
You...

33
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:07,570
How is Yinyin?

34
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:09,880
I raised you up.

35
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:11,340
We haven't seen each other for so long.

36
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:13,540
And you just care about the girl as soon as you open your eyes.

37
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:15,350
How ungrateful.

38
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:15,980
No.

39
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:17,110
Ungrateful.

40
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:18,250
Zhang, Huaniang,

41
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:19,640
I really miss you.

42
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:20,950
I miss you every day.

43
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:22,530
I thought you were dead.

44
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:24,510
Sit down.

45
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:25,340
Have some tea.

46
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:26,700
I'll get you some tea.

47
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:27,780
Don't worry about this girl.

48
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:28,579
She’ll wake up soon.

49
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,590
-Come on. Sit down.
-Well, she…

50
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:31,260
It's okay. There's the antidote.

51
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:32,520
I'll ask Huaniang to get her some antidote

52
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:33,150
and she'll be fine.

53
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:34,000
Come, have a seat.

54
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:35,070
Come on.

55
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:38,870
I heard

56
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:42,460
Ziwei Zhenren of the Xixuan Sect took you as his disciple.

57
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:46,180
The merchants coming and going in the past few days

58
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:49,550
gave their thumbs-up

59
00:03:49,579 --> 00:03:50,660
whenever they mentioned your name.

60
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:53,340
I heard that King of Haofang conferred you the Vanguard Exorcist.

61
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,329
Looks like you really learned something.

62
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:58,940
It's all thanks to the stone

63
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:00,100
that Huaniang asked me to wear.

64
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:02,260
People of Xixuan recognized me as a banished god because of it.

65
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:04,460
I had no choice

66
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:05,540
but to pretend to be one until now.

67
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:07,990
Without this stone,

68
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,560
how could you have reached where you are today?

69
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:15,580
But I was exposed today.

70
00:04:16,110 --> 00:04:16,890
Who exposed you?

71
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,959
That man was thrown off the cliff by us.

72
00:04:19,990 --> 00:04:21,820
He must have been eaten by wild dogs.

73
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:23,560
Could it be that he stood up to expose you?

74
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,030
He's not dead.

75
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:32,060
He has joined the Qingxu Sect.

76
00:04:32,659 --> 00:04:34,290
What's wrong? Did he seek revenge?

77
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:34,970
Soon.

78
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,740
Brat, are you scared?

79
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:40,140
I'm not scared.

80
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:42,070
I feel guilty.

81
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:44,460
My status and identity today

82
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:46,380
should belong to him.

83
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:49,570
You think too much.

84
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:53,320
A banished god can't even protect a stone.

85
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:55,930
Huaniang and I knew he was useless.

86
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:58,540
That's why we snatched this stone for you.

87
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:07,860
What do you mean?

88
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:11,300
You killed him

89
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:13,980
on purpose?

90
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:16,470
Yes.

91
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,340
We did kill the banished god on purpose

92
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:20,700
so that you can replace him.

93
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,070
But he's not dead.

94
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,860
Maybe it's fate.

95
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:28,420
All we did

96
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:31,900
is to send you to the path of cultivation.

97
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:36,070
That's the only way you can become a real banished god.

98
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:41,120
No wonder it's so strange.

99
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,860
So this is the reason.

100
00:05:47,159 --> 00:05:48,970
There's one more thing I don't understand.

101
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:52,330
This banished god is so powerful.

102
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:57,560
Why did I only knock on him

103
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,060
to defeat him?

104
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:01,300
What skills is it

105
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:03,310
you taught me?

106
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:04,890
Also,

107
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:07,060
who are you

108
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:09,410
exactly?

109
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:13,250
Good.

110
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:15,530
You've become smarter

111
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:16,490
after going on a journey.

112
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:19,490
Since you can see it,

113
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,180
we'll be honest with you.

114
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:25,220
We are the most powerful couple

115
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:26,310
among 13 demons from the Nine Hells.

116
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:28,750
People call us Duo Demons.

117
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:29,380
Master.

118
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,300
Is this demon from the Nine Hells?

119
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:33,100
Until our only son

120
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:34,820
died in Land of the Underworld.

121
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,240
Everything is fate.

122
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:37,980
We planned to kill that banished god on purpose.

123
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:39,760
If Ziwei mistakes someone for the banished god,

124
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:41,060
do you know what will happen?

125
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:42,900
You are the banished god of our sect.

126
00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:44,130
No matter what,

127
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:47,100
you must bring this treasure back to Xixuan Mountains.

128
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:48,659
We are the most powerful couple

129
00:06:48,659 --> 00:06:49,740
among 13 demons from the Nine Hells.

130
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,710
They call us Duo Demon.

131
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:54,390
That's why he tried so hard to find out a solution

132
00:06:54,450 --> 00:06:56,650
to end the chaos in the Three Realms.

133
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:05,560
Huaniang.

134
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:07,210
Please

135
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:09,760
help me cure Yinyin's poison.

136
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:12,000
We have other things to do.

137
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:31,060
I have something for you.

138
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:32,140
What is this?

139
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:34,520
Don't ask. Just take it.

140
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,840
It's not the time yet.

141
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:48,700
Open it when the time comes.

142
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:54,560
Put it away.

143
00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:05,780
Wake up, girl.

144
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:15,150
Yinyin.

145
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:16,340
It's fine.

146
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:17,770
Let's go treasure hunting.

147
00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:21,910
Boss.

148
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,520
See you.

149
00:08:55,310 --> 00:08:56,080
Master, Mistress.

150
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,190
There's no trace of the treasure.

151
00:08:57,230 --> 00:08:57,950
Stop fighting.

152
00:08:58,370 --> 00:08:58,850
Okay.

153
00:08:59,300 --> 00:08:59,940
Looks like

154
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:01,460
they won't let us off easily today.

155
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:03,500
Why don't we use the Sky Meteor Formation

156
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:05,200
and hold on until seniors come?

157
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:06,650
That's the only way.

158
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:12,400
Ruochen, you guard us.

159
00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:13,560
Yinyin, help me set up the formation.

160
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:14,080
Okay.

161
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:25,340
Jingxiao.

162
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,620
Let's see how long you can hold on.

163
00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:43,010
Everyone,

164
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,200
this is the real banished god.

165
00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:47,920
Ji Ruochen is a liar.

166
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:50,430
Ji Ruochen,

167
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:51,920
how long are you going to run away?

168
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:53,330
Who ran away?

169
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:55,500
He just doesn't want to talk to you.

170
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:57,650
Now Ruochen has killed

171
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,450
the demon Bamboo Snake.

172
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,190
They're here to steal treasures.

173
00:10:00,650 --> 00:10:02,000
Are you here for fame?

174
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:04,120
You are as shameless as them.

175
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:05,150
Ruochen.

176
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:06,860
You're injured after killing the demon.

177
00:10:07,010 --> 00:10:08,080
Take a good rest here.

178
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:10,110
If he dares to come here,

179
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:11,980
I'll teach him how to be a good immortal.

180
00:10:12,090 --> 00:10:12,650
No need.

181
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:14,260
He came here for me.

182
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,740
Let me handle this.

183
00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:17,960
But Ruochen...

184
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:18,700
Don't worry.

185
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:20,560
Wait for me.

186
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:28,590
I'll wait for you across the river.

187
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:45,640
It's been three years.

188
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:49,570
The day has finally arrived.

189
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:51,390
You owe me your life.

190
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:53,140
Now that even if I got it back,

191
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:54,550
I'm not bullying you.

192
00:10:55,090 --> 00:10:56,060
Believe it or not,

193
00:10:56,570 --> 00:10:58,550
I didn't want to kill you.

194
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:01,580
Stop explaining.

195
00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:02,730
No need.

196
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:06,700
I just want to tell the truth.

197
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:09,980
I thought Jinhua gave me the token

198
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:11,220
because she was greedy for money.

199
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,480
I didn't know I took your place.

200
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:15,140
So I fulfilled her wish.

201
00:11:16,090 --> 00:11:17,340
Later, I joined the Xixuan Sect,

202
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:18,890
making me even more trapped in a dilemma.

203
00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:22,320
I didn't want this to happen.

204
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:24,370
All these years,

205
00:11:26,810 --> 00:11:27,950
I've been feeling guilty.

206
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:30,500
I don't mind you deceiving the world for fame.

207
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,580
But I can't tolerate you lying to Qing

208
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:34,670
in the name of a banished god.

209
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,260
In order not to let her make more mistakes,

210
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:39,980
Ji Ruochen, you must die.

211
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,680
Do I have to kill him again?

212
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:35,250
Yinyin.

213
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:37,290
Yinyin.

214
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:38,420
Yinyin.

215
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:40,530
Yinyin.

216
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:43,450
Yinyin.

217
00:13:43,470 --> 00:13:44,910
Dragon Elephant, White Tiger, the Universal Cannon.

218
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:45,490
Okay.

219
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:54,630
Young Master, be careful.

220
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:55,580
Yinyin.

221
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:00,220
Why would you kill Ruochen?

222
00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:02,250
Qing.

223
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:04,630
I have regained my consciousness of god.

224
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:06,230
I am the banished god.

225
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:08,430
The one who promised to return to the God Realm with you

226
00:14:09,650 --> 00:14:10,340
is me.

227
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:14,060
How could it be?

228
00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:18,570
Ruochen.

229
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,440
You are not.

230
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:26,660
The heaven and earth are the witnesses and the bluestone is the evidence.

231
00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:28,820
How can you not be the banished god?

232
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:30,980
One can't go against the deity fate.

233
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:33,010
Qing.

234
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:35,240
He hurt me.

235
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:36,820
He lied to you.

236
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:39,310
Let me kill him.

237
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:57,580
Qing, I told you

238
00:14:57,820 --> 00:14:58,980
you got the wrong deity fate.

239
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:01,050
Then let it be.

240
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,390
If I want to kill him,

241
00:15:05,450 --> 00:15:06,710
no one can stop me.

242
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:18,970
Are you okay?

243
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:20,060
Ling.

244
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:24,440
He bullied me.

245
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:27,730
Step back.

246
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:28,430
No need.

247
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:29,510
This is my own business.

248
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:34,980
I'll take care of it.

249
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:59,540
♫ Moonlight clear as snow, my thoughts are hidden ♫

250
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:04,060
♫ Who plays a farewell tune in the alley ♫

251
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:12,630
♫ Lovesickness is like a butterfly. Floral fragrance fading away ♫

252
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:20,990
♫ Robes swirling, intoxicated, dancing to a poetic verse ♫

253
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:15,210
The inauspicious star has descended upon my fate.

254
00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:16,740
And my days are numbered.

255
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:20,290
I don’t want Yinyin to see me like this.

256
00:16:21,810 --> 00:16:23,480
Take Dragon Elephant and White Tiger

257
00:16:22,370 --> 00:16:27,660
♫ Moonlight bright as snow, loneliness fills the long street ♫

258
00:16:23,970 --> 00:16:25,060
and guard her to the Endless Sea.

259
00:16:26,070 --> 00:16:28,180
Young Master, come with me to the Endless Sea.

260
00:16:28,290 --> 00:16:29,820
I'm sure Uncle can save you.

261
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:32,230
♫ Shadows remain while forms intertwine with belief ♫

262
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:41,260
♫ Bustling sounds vanish between branches and leaves ♫

263
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:49,140
♫ Emotions turning, tears unseen ♫

264
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:56,020
♫ I feel as if I'm distant from this bustling world of crowds ♫

265
00:16:53,330 --> 00:16:54,030
Please.

266
00:16:56,180 --> 00:17:00,750
♫ Frowning, heart aching, love and hate entwined ♫

267
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:00,940
Young Master.

268
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:06,520
♫ Your tenderness separated by distance and time ♫

269
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:08,579
No matter how many souls I lose a day,

270
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:13,369
♫ And I can only embrace myself in care ♫

271
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:11,030
I always have a part of my soul

272
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:12,290
reserved for you.

273
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:19,250
♫ As the dim lights fade away, troubles come to a halt ♫

274
00:17:19,450 --> 00:17:24,020
♫ Still entangled with many emotional trials ♫

275
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:30,210
♫ You wrote a letter to make an appointment with me ♫

276
00:17:30,530 --> 00:17:38,240
♫ Leaving a startled glimpse in my heart ♫

277
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:00,410
Ruochen.

278
00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:05,000
This matter must be settled today.

279
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:08,090
This is between me and him.

280
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:10,490
I hope you stay out of it.

281
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:13,140
If you go on like this, you'll die in vain.

282
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:17,840
Some people and some things are still in my mind.

283
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,390
Why would I go and court death?

284
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:24,150
After what happened today,

285
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:27,940
I have something to tell you.

286
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,340
It's time to settle this.

287
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:43,380
And from today on,

288
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:45,730
you won't have the chance to talk to Qing again.

289
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:48,690
I've said what I should.

290
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:50,380
Back then, outside the border,

291
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:53,150
I didn't mean to kill you.

292
00:18:53,770 --> 00:18:54,240
Also,

293
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:56,270
I didn't intend to

294
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:58,260
replace you to be the banished god.

295
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:00,080
Now I'm in a dilemma.

296
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,730
I deserve it.

297
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:03,370
Stop making excuses for yourself.

298
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:08,100
I came here to meet someone and kill someone.

299
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:11,500
Now, I have met the person I should meet.

300
00:19:12,370 --> 00:19:15,450
The person who deserves to die must die.

301
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:19,180
Okay.

302
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:22,830
Then let us settle it with our swords.

303
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,040
What banished god?

304
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,170
I think he's just a loser.

305
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:08,970
This is bad.

306
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:11,720
Xuxuan intends to seize the opportunity to attack Ruochen.

307
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:12,740
Darling, don't act rashly.

308
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:13,930
It's urgent to save Ruochen.

309
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:15,020
I don't care.

310
00:20:34,030 --> 00:20:35,670
As expected, you indeed intends to launch a sneak attack from behind.

311
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:36,250
Xuxuan.

312
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:37,610
If you take another step,

313
00:20:37,930 --> 00:20:39,940
the two sects of ours will be enemies.

314
00:20:40,410 --> 00:20:41,150
I've been waiting

315
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:42,690
to turn into bitter enemies with Xixuan.

316
00:20:42,810 --> 00:20:43,270
Jingxiao,

317
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:45,100
I'll start with you today.

318
00:20:54,350 --> 00:20:55,270
What skill is this?

319
00:20:55,530 --> 00:20:56,610
It can block the immortal arts?

320
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:14,800
The Dreadstar Fate-Infusion Technique?

321
00:21:26,390 --> 00:21:26,990
Ruochen.

322
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:29,110
Ruochen.

323
00:21:29,610 --> 00:21:30,060
Ruochen.

324
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:31,460
Look at me, Ruochen.

325
00:21:31,810 --> 00:21:32,290
Qing.

326
00:21:32,970 --> 00:21:34,550
-I’m here, Qing.
-You promised to wait for me.

327
00:21:34,570 --> 00:21:35,110
Qing.

328
00:21:36,850 --> 00:21:38,610
Ruochen! Look at me!

329
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:39,270
Ruochen.

330
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:43,890
Am I dying?

331
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:46,350
If I had known,

332
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,000
I wouldn't have bragged.

333
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:53,200
Ruochen.

334
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,460
You fight for the people.

335
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:58,330
God won't kill you.

336
00:22:00,330 --> 00:22:01,150
Don't worry.

337
00:22:02,090 --> 00:22:03,830
Although the infusion of the dreadstar is beyond remedy,

338
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:06,460
my immortal immortal dharma-laksana

339
00:22:07,530 --> 00:22:09,190
can bring people back to life.

340
00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:11,150
I want to save you.

341
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:14,540
Even if it means severing the path back to the immortal realm,

342
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:15,200
I will save you.

343
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:17,540
Qing, no!

344
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:18,630
Qing.

345
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:21,080
By then,

346
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:24,490
you will remember our past.

347
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:27,340
With you around,

348
00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:31,410
why wouldn't I rest assured?

349
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:53,940
I told you

350
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:57,260
I would marry you

351
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,370
when I get back to the mountains.

352
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:03,660
But now,

353
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:07,360
I might break my promise.

354
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:10,880
Don't blame me.

355
00:23:13,770 --> 00:23:14,780
Yinyin.

356
00:23:18,950 --> 00:23:20,390
As you know,

357
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:24,610
I'm just Ji Clerk.

358
00:23:25,230 --> 00:23:26,820
I never thought

359
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:31,960
I could be a disciple of Xixuan.

360
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:36,540
I also never thought

361
00:23:37,130 --> 00:23:38,750
I could meet you.

362
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:44,210
The time I spent with you

363
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:46,890
is the happiest time for me.

364
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:50,820
I have no regrets in my life.

365
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:55,730
Thank you.

366
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:42,650
As the Hierarch of Qingxu,

367
00:24:43,330 --> 00:24:45,000
you hurt me with a poisonous sword?

368
00:24:47,590 --> 00:24:49,100
The dreadstar has descended upon Ji Ruochen's fate.

369
00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:51,600
Just wait for Ziyang to collect your bodies.

370
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:07,820
To merge as one with the sword,

371
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:09,970
as long as the sword exists, the person exists.

372
00:25:10,890 --> 00:25:12,390
Is my husband...

373
00:25:26,570 --> 00:25:27,930
The Sky Meteor Formation has been broken.

374
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:28,910
Kill them!

375
00:25:38,330 --> 00:25:39,090
Mistress Huang.

376
00:25:43,370 --> 00:25:45,570
Looks like we're going to die here today.

377
00:25:46,190 --> 00:25:47,270
You shouldn't have come.

378
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:49,250
To Die for Xixuan's righteousness.

379
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:50,290
What a pleasure!

380
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:51,890
What death? Stop talking nonsense!

381
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:53,630
Master, where are you?

382
00:25:54,590 --> 00:25:56,110
Those old men in Xixuan

383
00:25:56,260 --> 00:25:57,620
are all cowards.

384
00:25:57,650 --> 00:25:58,520
They fear death.

385
00:25:59,110 --> 00:26:01,470
I want to see who will save you.

386
00:26:10,710 --> 00:26:11,780
Master! Hierarch!

387
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:13,620
Ziyang Zhenren.

388
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:16,770
It seems the Xixuan Sect has gone all out.

389
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:21,790
You've been scheming against Xixuan openly or secretly.

390
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:23,810
But it's really rare for you

391
00:26:24,230 --> 00:26:25,500
to gather here today.

392
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:27,500
We shouldn't fight now.

393
00:26:27,690 --> 00:26:28,250
Let's go.

394
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:53,050
Darling.

395
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:55,520
Darling!

396
00:26:55,550 --> 00:26:56,790
Be careful. Don't touch him.

397
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:57,700
Be careful of poisoning.

398
00:27:00,070 --> 00:27:00,670
Darling!

399
00:27:05,570 --> 00:27:06,660
This is the secret poison of Qingxu.

400
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:09,110
Those who are poisoned will gradually petrify throughout their entire body.

401
00:27:09,790 --> 00:27:10,820
They can breathe,

402
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:12,490
but it's no different from death.

403
00:27:13,510 --> 00:27:14,200
Darling.

404
00:27:15,530 --> 00:27:16,530
Wake up, Ruochen.

405
00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:18,110
Wake up, Ruochen.

406
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:21,980
Even if what you see is Zhang Yinyin,

407
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:24,310
after I save you,

408
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:27,280
you will remember our companionship of ten thousand years.

409
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:41,320
Qing.

410
00:27:43,290 --> 00:27:44,140
Qing! No!

411
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:45,020
Qing!

412
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:54,610
Qing!

413
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:01,300
Qing, no!

414
00:28:02,770 --> 00:28:04,310
You enlightened me back then.

415
00:28:05,610 --> 00:28:06,420
Ji Ruochen,

416
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:09,210
I must save you no matter what.

417
00:28:10,950 --> 00:28:12,060
Qing, no!

418
00:28:12,630 --> 00:28:13,380
No!

419
00:28:13,870 --> 00:28:14,670
Qing!

420
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:18,060
Senior, you can't do that.

421
00:28:18,650 --> 00:28:19,830
If you lose your immortal dharma-laksana,

422
00:28:19,910 --> 00:28:21,270
you will be no different from mortals.

423
00:28:21,550 --> 00:28:23,640
Your thousand years of cultivation will be destroyed.

424
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:26,690
In order to save the world,

425
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:28,530
Ruochen can sacrifice his life.

426
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:30,850
If I don't save him,

427
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:34,300
what's the use of this immortal dharma-laksana?

428
00:28:36,650 --> 00:28:38,620
Maybe God arranged me to meet him

429
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:41,080
to help him

430
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:45,060
to rebuild his immortal soul.

431
00:28:45,930 --> 00:28:48,050
But you should know what Ji Ruochen is thinking.

432
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:49,540
No matter how much you do,

433
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:51,270
he will still let you down.

434
00:28:51,810 --> 00:28:52,610
For him,

435
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:53,940
is it worth it?

436
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:58,270
If I can't return to the God Realm,

437
00:28:59,450 --> 00:29:02,220
I'll end my life in this mortal world.

438
00:29:04,650 --> 00:29:05,180
Qing.

439
00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:46,140
Ruochen, be careful.

440
00:29:46,410 --> 00:29:47,250
I'm here to save you.

441
00:29:58,060 --> 00:29:58,930
Why are you here?

442
00:29:59,270 --> 00:29:59,920
You're injured.

443
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:02,040
Master asked me to bring you the medicine.

444
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:07,100
Ruochen.

445
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:08,770
Where is Ruochen?

446
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:10,590
And Qingyi.

447
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:12,200
Qingyi was scolded by Master.

448
00:30:12,670 --> 00:30:13,240
She said

449
00:30:13,630 --> 00:30:14,740
Uncle made her unhappy.

450
00:30:16,030 --> 00:30:16,880
Uncle?

451
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:21,730
Qingyi does have an uncle,

452
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:23,550
Master of the Endless Sea.

453
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:24,780
Master is Uncle.

454
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:26,120
Uncle is Master.

455
00:30:26,850 --> 00:30:27,380
Then...

456
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:30,700
this is...

457
00:30:31,130 --> 00:30:31,710
Endless Sea.

458
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:35,360
There really is a sea.

459
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:43,610
Take me to your master.

460
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:45,700
He only asked me to take care of you.

461
00:30:46,330 --> 00:30:47,860
But he didn't ask me to take you to see him.

462
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:49,080
What's the difference?

463
00:30:49,530 --> 00:30:50,150
There is a difference.

464
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:51,460
Take the medicine.

465
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:53,460
Who wants your medicine?

466
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:00,500
Ruochen.

467
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:08,160
Ji Ruochen!

468
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:17,590
Ji Ruochen, where are you?

469
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:31,140
The person you're looking for is not here.

470
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:32,540
He has returned to Xixuan Mountains.

471
00:31:37,170 --> 00:31:37,690
Take the medicine.

472
00:31:37,850 --> 00:31:38,690
Keep it for yourself.

473
00:31:38,810 --> 00:31:39,460
No, thanks.

474
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:41,900
I'm leaving now.

475
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:43,380
Tell your master

476
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:44,630
to thank him for saving my life.

477
00:31:45,530 --> 00:31:46,440
And thank you.

478
00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:51,150
Ling.

479
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:53,400
Can you find me a boat?

480
00:31:58,040 --> 00:31:59,410
It's quite impressive.

481
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:00,760
When you go to Xixuan Mountains,

482
00:32:00,790 --> 00:32:02,140
tell them you know me.

483
00:32:02,430 --> 00:32:03,140
I’ll protect you.

484
00:32:06,810 --> 00:32:07,390
I'm leaving.

485
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:42,670
You're awake, Ruochen.

486
00:32:43,070 --> 00:32:43,500
Qiushui.

487
00:32:45,710 --> 00:32:47,450
Master Ziyang said you would wake up today.

488
00:32:47,710 --> 00:32:48,900
and asked us to take good care of you.

489
00:32:49,180 --> 00:32:50,860
I didn't expect it to be so accurate.

490
00:32:51,170 --> 00:32:51,670
Yes.

491
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:54,470
When did I come back?

492
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:56,250
We were so worried.

493
00:32:56,510 --> 00:32:57,830
You've been in a coma for three days.

494
00:32:59,590 --> 00:33:00,520
During these three days,

495
00:33:01,450 --> 00:33:02,650
how was Haofang City?

496
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:04,350
How is everyone?

497
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:06,180
Don’t worry.

498
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:08,020
The people of Haofang are safe.

499
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:09,760
Zhenren of the all schools arrived in time.

500
00:33:09,890 --> 00:33:11,800
The enemies were defeated

501
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:12,610
and fled.

502
00:33:12,810 --> 00:33:13,580
That scene

503
00:33:13,610 --> 00:33:14,970
was deeply satisfying.

504
00:33:15,890 --> 00:33:16,730
Unfortunately,

505
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:18,950
Sun Guo ran away.

506
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:21,360
Where is Yinyin?

507
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:24,240
I asked Qingyi to take her away.

508
00:33:24,950 --> 00:33:25,830
Did she come back?

509
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:29,900
She should still be in the Endless Sea.

510
00:33:30,210 --> 00:33:30,920
But don’t worry.

511
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:32,300
Qingyi is taking care of her.

512
00:33:32,430 --> 00:33:33,180
She will be fine.

513
00:33:35,310 --> 00:33:35,730
You...

514
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:36,530
What are you doing?

515
00:33:37,450 --> 00:33:38,930
I'm going to get her back.

516
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,070
No, Ruochen.

517
00:33:40,210 --> 00:33:41,760
The dreadstar has descended upon your fate.

518
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:43,710
What you should do now is to rest.

519
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:45,340
-Why rush?
-Yeah.

520
00:33:46,290 --> 00:33:46,910
No.

521
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:50,330
She was hurt by Yinfeng by the Haoshui River.

522
00:33:50,730 --> 00:33:51,670
Where did she hurt?

523
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:53,640
Did it hurt her life?

524
00:33:53,890 --> 00:33:55,010
I don't know all these.

525
00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:57,140
And in the Endless Sea,

526
00:33:57,740 --> 00:33:58,990
I don't know

527
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:00,780
how they treat her.

528
00:34:01,770 --> 00:34:03,500
She must be looking for me now.

529
00:34:03,970 --> 00:34:05,290
I must bring her back.

530
00:34:05,850 --> 00:34:06,290
Ruochen.

531
00:34:06,290 --> 00:34:08,370
-Is this the good disciple of your Xixuan Sect?
-Ruochen.

532
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:09,710
How ruthless.

533
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:11,060
This is a private house.

534
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:11,969
Who allowed you to come in?

535
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:16,380
Ji Ruochen.

536
00:34:16,889 --> 00:34:18,370
You made my senior suffer.

537
00:34:19,219 --> 00:34:19,880
But you?

538
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:21,639
The first thing you want to do when you wake up

539
00:34:21,739 --> 00:34:23,420
is to meet your lover.

540
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:27,560
Miss Shi Ji, what do you mean?

541
00:34:27,860 --> 00:34:29,219
What do I mean?

542
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:32,210
In the battle of Haofang,

543
00:34:32,810 --> 00:34:34,199
you became famous.

544
00:34:35,610 --> 00:34:36,870
But in order to save you,

545
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:39,179
my senior lost her immortal dharma-laksana.

546
00:34:39,389 --> 00:34:40,920
She's no different from a mortal now.

547
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:43,090
There's no chance of returning to the God Realm.

548
00:34:43,659 --> 00:34:46,139
Even if you pay it with your life,

549
00:34:46,179 --> 00:34:47,159
you won't be able to pay it back.

550
00:35:09,470 --> 00:35:10,030
Who is it?

551
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:12,120
Gu Qing, it's me.

552
00:35:14,270 --> 00:35:14,850
Come in.

553
00:35:25,270 --> 00:35:26,430
Are you feeling better?

554
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:28,610
Much better.

555
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:31,460
Great.

556
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:36,560
Gu Qing,

557
00:35:37,830 --> 00:35:38,440
I lied to you.

558
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:42,010
Since the first time we met,

559
00:35:42,770 --> 00:35:43,890
I've been lying.

560
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:46,560
I'm not a banished god.

561
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:49,220
I'm just an imposter.

562
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:51,820
So what?

563
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:53,800
So what?

564
00:35:55,580 --> 00:35:56,670
In order to save me,

565
00:35:56,990 --> 00:35:58,340
you've lost your immortal dharma-laksana.

566
00:35:58,970 --> 00:36:00,250
How are you going to cultivate your deity fate?

567
00:36:00,670 --> 00:36:02,240
How can you go back to the God Realm with someone who has a appointment with you

568
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:03,100
for a hundred lifetimes?

569
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:05,190
Isn't this what you've been thinking about?

570
00:36:06,790 --> 00:36:07,780
It doesn't matter anymore.

571
00:36:10,450 --> 00:36:11,120
Why?

572
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:14,450
If you weren't the one who came back with me together,

573
00:36:15,710 --> 00:36:18,780
what's the use of the immortal dharma-laksana?

574
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:37,570
You...

575
00:36:38,210 --> 00:36:39,060
That's good.

576
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:41,550
I'm now a mortal

577
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:45,780
like everyone else, like you.

578
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:51,310
I'm sorry.

579
00:36:55,220 --> 00:36:55,820
I'm sorry.

580
00:37:02,050 --> 00:37:02,580
Ruochen.

581
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:05,770
I can't go back anymore.

582
00:37:06,610 --> 00:37:07,600
Why don't you and I

583
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:10,360
stay with each other in this mortal world?

584
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:12,510
Would you like it?

585
00:37:16,580 --> 00:37:17,570
I can't repay

586
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:22,340
your kindness to me in my life.

587
00:37:23,790 --> 00:37:24,990
I will promise you

588
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:25,860
anything you want me to do,

589
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:30,290
except

590
00:37:32,030 --> 00:37:32,760
this one.

591
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:20,170
Ji Ruochen,

592
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:23,470
if you met me first,

593
00:38:24,090 --> 00:38:26,690
would the result be different?

594
00:38:29,110 --> 00:38:30,590
He doesn't want it,

595
00:38:30,620 --> 00:38:32,100
but you insist on forcing him.

596
00:38:32,260 --> 00:38:33,740
Bah! Shameless!

597
00:38:33,740 --> 00:38:35,180
What if I die?

598
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:36,660
I don't even know the name

599
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:37,260
of my savior.

600
00:38:37,340 --> 00:38:38,380
It'll be a lifetime regret.

601
00:38:38,420 --> 00:38:39,250
Then listen carefully.

602
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:41,200
I'm Zhang Yinyin, the eldest disciple of Taixuan Palace of Xixuan Sect.

603
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:41,860
Zhang Yinyin.

604
00:38:42,260 --> 00:38:42,660
Let's go.

605
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:44,540
You should hold me tight.

606
00:38:45,270 --> 00:38:45,880
What are you doing?

607
00:38:50,550 --> 00:38:58,950
♫ I've seen the world but longing remains unclear ♫

608
00:38:59,770 --> 00:39:04,100
♫ Circling as the curve tightly held in our hands ♫

609
00:39:04,470 --> 00:39:06,760
♫ A glance, a fateful encounter ♫

610
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:14,890
♫ I wait in memories for your appearance ♫
